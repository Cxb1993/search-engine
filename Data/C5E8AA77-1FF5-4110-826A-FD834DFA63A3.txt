Abstract 
In this work, the impact of anode porosity on a NiO-SDC (Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9) anode-supported 
solid oxide fuel cell is investigated by addition of pore formers (graphite, starch, polymethyl 
methacrylate) which create a controlled porous architecture. The anode-supported NiO- 
SDC/SDC/SDC-SSC (Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3) single cell is evaluated under single chamber operation 
conditions with a mixture of methane and oxygen. Various weight ratios of the pore former in the 
electrode slurry are studied and characterized. Multi-layer anode support is employed to create the 
porosity gradient for better understanding the functionality of the porous microstructure.  
Introduction 
The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a promising candidate for clean energy technologies. It 
possesses several unique advantages, including flexible fuels, cheaper materials for each component 
and higher overall efficiency (~80%) taking into account the combined utilization of the produced 
power and heat. It is particularly suitable in stationary applications, for example, distributed power 
plants. 
To achieve higher power output, there are several concerns in terms of materials and geometry 
of each component in a single SOFC. Among these issues, the electrode microstructure is highly 
correlated with the reaction kinetics. The percolation of electronic, ionic and reactant/product 
pathways determines the effective three-phase-boundary length of the electrode, which directly 
links to its performance [1]. It is extremely important for SOFCs of electrode-supported 
configuration, where the microstructure strongly influences the utilization of the electrode support, 
more specifically, the ease of access of reactants to the electrode layer close to the 
electrolyte/electrode interface where has been claimed to be the active region of the electrode [2]. 
To fulfill the requirement mentioned above, a porosity gradient microstructure was recently 
proposed, which can be achieved with fine adjustment of the slurry composition (active materials, 
pore former and binder) along the depth from the electrode surface [3, 4]. Improvement of the 
power output was achieved by porosity gradient anode with [5] or without [6] composition gradient. 
The effectiveness of the porosity gradient electrode was demonstrated with the electrode-supported 
SOFC operating in dual-chamber mode (hydrogen and oxygen fed to anode and cathode, 
respectively) [7-12]. 
For SOFCs fueled by hydrocarbons, the electrode catalytic ability is critical. For instance, 
methane, commonly used as the fuel, can minimize the gas phase reaction with oxygen and is 
particularly suitable for single chamber SOFC (SC-SOFC) [13-17]. However, the high stability of 
methane results in poor oxidation activity over the SOFC anode without addition of precious metal 
as the catalyst [13]. In our previous work, it was found that an anode- supported Ni-SDC/SDC/SSC 
cell, without the addition of precious metal to the anode, was able to produce an obvious increase in 
the power density over that of an electrolyte-supported one [13]. This increase is proposed to have 
higher number of active sites for partial oxidation of methane provided by anode support and less 
resistance with the thin SDC film [18].  
diffraction (XRD) technique using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-RC, Japan) operated 
under Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA. The particle size distribution of the SDC powders was 
determined with a laser light scattering system. The microstructures and thickness of the electrode 
and the electrolyte were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6500F). 
For electrochemical characterization, Ag net and Ag wires were attached to the electrode surfaces 
for current collection.  
The impedance of the SOFC cell was characterized using an electrochemical system 
combining a Solartron 1260 Frequency Response Analyzer and a Solartron 1286 Potentiostat. The 
applied frequency ranged from 105 to 10-1 Hz with the signal amplitude of 20 mV. Prior to 
characterization, the anode was reduced at 600 oC for 6 hr in a flowing mixture gas of H2 and Ar in 
a volumetric ratio of 1 : 9 and a flow rate of 100 mL min-1. The reactant gas was composed of 
methane and air premixed in a ratio of 3 : 7. The total flow rate was fixed at 300 sccm. 
Results and Discussion 
First of all the impact of various kinds of pore formers (5 wt%) was evaluated during 
preparation of the Ni-SDC anode support. The corresponding microstructures are shown in Fig. 1. 
Compared to the Ni-SDC anode support without pore former (Fig. 1(a)), slab-like pores several to 
10 μm in length and ~ 1 μm in width were found in the one with graphite as the pore former (Fig. 
1(b)). For electrode supports with starch (Fig. 1(c)) and PMMA (Fig. 1(d)), much larger irregular 
pores are found. When examining the discharging curves of the Ni-SDC/SDC/SSC-SDC cells made 
by different pore formers (Fig 2(a)), only the one with graphite as the pore former exhibited better 
performance than that without pore former. The peak power density for each single cell was 269, 
230, 212 and 255 mW cm-2 for the cell with 5 wt% graphite, 5 wt% starch, 5 wt% PMMA and none 
as the pore former, respectively. Considering the open circuit potential (OCP) of the single cell, 
only a slight change with pore former was observed. Similar OCP (~0.84 V) was found for the cells 
without pore former and with 5 wt% graphite. The OCP for the rest was slightly lower than 0.84 V. 
In addition, the impedance for all the cells at OCP seems the same since it may be dominated by the 
smaller cathode (Fig. 2(b)). Therefore the difference of the electrochemical performance may result 
from the mass transport of methane, which is altered by the microstructure of the anode supports. 
The impact of graphite content on the anode support was then considered. With the increase of 
the graphite content, more slab-like pores were shown in the prepared anode support (10 wt%, Fig. 
1 (e)), indicating the space occupied by graphite was able to preserved during heating. Upon 
increasing the graphite content to 15 wt%, the mechanical strength of the prepared anode support 
became so weak that was unable to survive from the following process. Further, the corresponding 
electrochemical performance was evaluated at 600 oC (Fig. 3(a)). The peak power density for the 
single cell with 0, 5 and 10 wt% graphite was 255, 269 and 297 mW cm-2, respectively, indicating 
better improvement with higher graphite content for anode support. This may have been due to the 
better mass transport of methane into the active site of the anode support, while the reaction kinetic 
is almost unchanged with porosity of anode support. It can be realized by the identical OCP values 
[19]. 
Multi-layer anode support was evaluated to further correlate the porosity gradient microstructure 
to their electrochemical behaviors. Two-layer anode supports composed of a first layer with 5wt% 
graphite content fixed (in contact with electrolyte layer) and a second layer with graphite content
