ABSTRACT 
This project :1A study of tensile-torsional damage coupled mechanical behavior 
and fatigue life prediction for solder joints in electronic packaging(L)N
(NSC97-2212-E-006-072), aims to provide an analytical methodology to predict 
tensile/torsional damage–coupled cyclic stress/strain behavior and its Endochronic 
fatigue life prediction for solder balls in the solder joint specimen made of 
BGA/CSP/FC manufacturing processes in electronic packaging(PKG). 
In the report , nine solder balls in the BGA solder joints specimens under oblique 
displacement controlled cyclic tests were employed to provide data of hysteresis loops 
of mixed mode load vs. displacement of a testing system(including solder joints 
specimen and grip system). By elastic unloading with elastic modulus of bulk 
specimens of solder alloys and the linear behavior of grips system, a systematic 
method in the determination of grip stiffness under displacement oblique angles was 
established. This converted the data successfully into hysteresis loops of stress vs. 
strain of solder ball under cyclically proportional straining path. After applications of 
author’s 1Endochronic cyclic viscoplasticity of solder alloysNto Sn/3.5Ag/0.75Cu 
solder ball, and comparions of their material parameters determined with those of 
bulk specimens, their results found that () In the kernal function( 0 /KZe Z αρ − ) of 
solder ball, except smaller values in ρ0
 
  the values of (α , K ) are almost the 
same.(2)In the material function associated with the intrinsic time measure, Sn/Ag/Cu 
solder ball depends on the amplitude of equivalent inelastic strains and the 
displacement oblique angles.                                    
The above results construct the foundation of the future proposal(). In that, the 
methodology developed in the report can be extended to convert the damage-coupled 
experimental data of solder joint specimens and then to determine the tensile-torsional 
material functions associated with the damage-coupled endochronic viscoplasticity. 
As a result predictions of fatigue initiation life can be studied.

modulus etc.) depend on testing framework, specimen’s size, specimen’s procedures 
of preparation or PKG methodology, and the specific constitutive modeling. In this 
paper, authors will employ data of mixed-mode cyclic loading provided by Park et. al. 
[7~10] and propose a systematic method to transfer the cyclic force vs. displacement 
hysteresis loops of testing system with solder joint specimens into multiaxial cyclic 
stress-strain hysteresis loops of solder balls themselves. Then values of material 
properties and material functions associated in the author’s Endochronic cyclic 
viscoplasticity [11~13] will be determined and discussed for Sn/3.5Ag/0.75Cu solder 
balls in BGA solder joint specimens. 
 
2.  SPECIMENS UNDER OBLIQUE DISPLACEMENT CYCLIC TESTS 
2.1 BGA solder joint specimens   
In this paper, experiments conducted by Park et.al. [7~10] were used. Specimens 
consisted of nine Sn/3.5Ag/0.75Cu micro-sized solder balls attached to mating 
soldermask defined FR-4 PCB substrates (thickness 0.8mm see Fig. 1(a)). Based on 
conventional manufacturing procedures of ball grid array packaging(BGA) and their 
reflow temperature profiles, specimens of BGA Sn/Ag/Cu solder joint were prepared 
and their configuration were 0.76mm ball diameter,1.27mm pitch and 520 mµ  
standoff height, see Fig. 1.[10]. The specimens were aged for 2 months at room 
temperature and then bonded to steel grips by using a cyanoacrylate adhesive [10]. 
 
2.2 Oblique displacement controlled cyclic tests and results  
A self-designed micromechanical testing system, containing an ac-type LVDT 
stroke control with triangular wave and constant displacement rate 2 mµ /s, was 
used[10]. To conduct oblique displacement controlled cyclic tests, perpendicular 
direction of contacting surfaces between grip and specimen were machined into angle
Φ degree with respect to the moving direction of stroke, see Fig.2[10].  
As a consequence, solder joints were tested under tensile-torsional cyclic loading 
conditions. Experimental results of the testing system (including solder balls, steel 
grips, adhesive, metallization layers,FR-4 substrates etc.) were presented by 
force( FΦ )-displacement( dΦ ) hysteresis loops along the direction of stroke motion.

system, the representative solder ball during unloading process must be linearly 
elastic with a Φ  dependent constant of stiffness ( SKΦ ). From Fig.4, the serial

To determine SKΦ , the linearly elastic behavior of the representative solder ball 
during unloading process must be considered. Similar notions ( ,F dΦ Φ ) used in Fig.5, 
the force-displacement curves of representative solder ball ( ,S SF dΦ Φ ), started from the 
unloading point A, can be defined as ( ,S SF dΦ Φ ) with SF FΦ Φ= and S S SAd d dΦ Φ Φ= − . Under 
an oblique angleΦ , the normal and engineering shear strains can be calculated 
respectively by  
cos /S Sd Lε
Φ= Φ  
sin /S Sd Lγ
Φ= Φ                (2a,b). 
Denote E  and µ as the Young’s modulus and the elastic shear modulus respectively, 
the normal stress σ  and the shear stress τ  measured from the unloading point A, 
become 
Eσ ε=  
τ µγ=                     (3a,b). 
The resulting force acting on the solder ball is 
2 2
S SF A σ τ= +                       (4a) 
with a phase angle θ w.r.t the axial direction of the solder ball (i.e. solder joint 
specimen)  
1 1tan ( ) tan ( tan )Eθ τ σ µ− −= = Φ             (4b). 
As a consequence, the resulting force w.r.t the stroke direction of testing system, 
becomes 
cos( )S SF F θΦ = −Φ                     (5) 
Substituting Eqs. (3a,b) and (4a,b) into Eq.(5)and then S S SK F dΦ Φ Φ≡  yields

4.  APPLICATIONS OF THE ENDOCHRONIC CYCLIC VISCOPLASTICITY 
Details in the theoretical formulation of the constitutive modeling and the 
resulting constitutive equations in the Endochronic cyclic viscoplasticity can be 
shown in the paper of first author[11]. Under constant temperature the general form of 
the deviatoric stress( S

expressed as 
0( ) KZZ e Z αρ ρ −=          (11) 
where 0 , Kρ and α are material parameters whose values are not sensitive to strain 
rates under cyclic loading condition. The definition of intrinsic time scale Z takes the 
responsibility of the viscoplastic behavior, in which its rate Z (i.e. dZ dt ) can be 
defined as

here the rate of intrinsic time measure ξi  is defined as the norm of INe

). Under cyclically stable response the material function ( )f ξ  can 
take a constant value 0f , however the values of strain rate sensitive material function 
0 ( )h ξ

 can be determined by a power form of ξi  [11]. In the present paper, since all 
cyclic tests were under a fixed displacement rate ( 2d m sµ=

where IN

. Furthermore, in 
order to use hysteresis loops of representative solder ball under 90οΦ =  as a 
reference to determined material parameters, Eq.(12) is simplified into  
0f f ( ) ( )INag e= Φ           (13b). 
Combining Eqs. (12) and (13a),lead

Eq.(20) can be used in Eq.(13b) and then apply in the incremental constitutive 
equations Eqs. (17a~e) to compute the hysteresis loops of τ vs. γ under various
a

As indicated in Fig.8, their results were in very well agreement with those loops of 
experiment.     
 
4.3 Determination of f(0) and the Endochronic prediction of uniaxially cyclic test
(Φ=0)  
Under uniaxially cyclic test( 0Φ = ), 0 SF Aσ =  and 0S Sd Lε = .By the same 
consideration as indicated in Fig.5,Eq.(14), reads 
( )0, 3 2IN INadZ e dκ ε=                 (21). 
Choosing a small value of INε (hence 1.0KZe−  ), Eq.(10a) becomes

Taking INε have the same small value of INγ in the reference τ vs. INγ curve, 
combination of Eqs.(18) and (22),can determine the value of ( )0, INaeκ  ,i.e.

In the prediction of steady hysteresis loops ofσ vs. ε, one can use the

discussed in §3.1,the increments of stress based on the unloading points σ∆  and 
τ∆ can be computed.The increment of mixed-mode resulting force of solder ball is
2 2
S SF A σ τ∆ = ∆ + ∆  and its phase angle is ( )1tanθ τ σ−∆ = ∆ ∆ .The increment of 
mixed-mode force in the direction of stroke motion becomes

( )2 2 1cos tanSF A σ τ τ σ−Φ∆ = ∆ + ∆ ∆ ∆ −Φ        (26). 
The data set of ( ), SF d ΦΦ∆ ∆ can be plotted from the unloading point and finally, the 
hysteresis loops of FΦvs. Sd

experimental loops. 
Here 45Φ =  was employed first. Since, ( )0, INaeκ  =1.0and ( )90 , INaeκ   0.55
under 
a
d =10 mµ , ( )45 , INaeκ   under the same ad  can be chosen as the mean 
value(0.775) for the first try. The computational results of 45F vs. 45Sd loop were very 
close to the experimental loop. After a few iteration, the value of ( )45 , INaeκ   was 
determined at 0.79,the resulting hysteresis loop computed was in very well agreement 
with the experimental loop, as shown in Fig.9.The corresponding cyclic curves of σ vs.
