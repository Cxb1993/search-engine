different from those of bulk compounds. In 
most cases, tensile strain suppresses 
ferromagnetism which is generally interpreted 
by considering a strain induced distortion of 
MnO6 octahedra4-5. But some anomalous 
results have also been reported showing 
ferromagnetism enhanced by tensile strain6-7. 
Moreover, some novel properties were 
observed in CMR thin films[8], indicating that 
strain effect can be utilize to tailor or optimize 
the magnetotransport properties of CMR thin 
films, although a thorough understanding of 
strain effect is still unavailable and 
challenging. There have been few studies of 
heterostructures and superlattices 
incorporating CMR manganites and 
epitaxially compatible oxides9-10. All of these 
works suggest that there is an anomalous 
strain effect, which may induce some novel 
and interesting properties in LBMO thin films. 
A detailed study of the strained LBMO thin 
film may help us go further in wholly 
understanding strain effect. In this work, we 
report a systematic investigation of magnetic 
properties in the variety of strained LBMO 
thin films by means of LBMO/LNO 
asymmetric superlattice structure in which 
LNO was used because it has satisfactory 
crystallographic compatibility for 
heteroepitaxial growth of a perovskite layer11; 
a smaller lattice than that of LBMO that 
introduces a lattice mismatch strain at the 
hetero-interface serves to as a stressor for the 
manganite LBMO sublayer. Here we 
demonstrate the importance of correlation 
between structural information and magnetic 
properties obtained from x-ray scattering, 
absorption and magnetic measurements. 
3. Experiment 
   Thin film deposition was performed 
using a radio frequency (rf) magnetron 
sputtering dual-gun system. During deposition, 
the substrate temperature was kept at 550 oC 
and the gas pressure of deposition was fixed 
at 15mTorr with an Ar/O2 ratio 3:1.  
The superlattice structure was 
characterized also on measuring the (002) 
crystal truncation rod (CTR) intensities with a 
synchrotron x-ray source.  The detailed 
experimental set up has been described 
elsewhere.11 Manganese K-edge x-ray 
absorption spectra were recorded at the 
wiggler beamline Taiwan. A Si (111) 
double-crystal monochromator with a 1.0 mm 
entrance slit was used for energy scanning.  
The energy resolution, ΔE/E, was about 
1.9×10-4.  Measurements were performed at 
room temperature in fluorescence mode and 
the sample was positioned at 90o to the 
incident x-ray beam.   
 
4. Results and Discussion 
Azimuthal scans across the {102} 
Bragg reflections of the LBMO films grown 
at a plasma power of 2.47 and 3.7W/cm2 
clearly reveal a fourfold symmetry as 
presented in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. 
However, no clear feature of the Bragg 
reflection from the LBMO film was observed 
from the film grown at 1.23W/cm2; this film 
was found to have poor in-plane structural 
coherency. The LBMO film grown at 
1.23W/cm2 exhibits a c-axis textured structure, 
indicating that sufficient plasma power is 
required to grow an epitaxial LBMO film on a 
STO substrate by rf magnetron sputtering.

background of x-ray absorption spectra, 
which was fit to a straight line, was 
extrapolated throughout the entire data range 
and then subtracted. The post-edge 
background was simulated by a cubic spline 
in order to isolate the EXAFS oscillations 
from the overall absorption.  The EXAFS 
function, so-called χ(k) data, was obtained by 
subtracting the post-edge background from 
the overall absorption data followed by 
normalization with respect to the edge step.  
After being weighted by k3, where k is the 
photoelectron wave vector, the χ data in the 
range of 2.7<k<11.4Å-1 were Fourier 
transformed into r-space.  The data in 
r-space between 0 and 10Å was then 
windowed and back-transformed (filtered) to 
get rid of high-frequency noise for subsequent 
comparison. Figure 4(a) shows the magnitude 
of Fourier transform of the EXAFS function 
at the Mn K-edge for the LBMO/LNO 
superlattices having different modulation 
length. From the Fourier transform of the 
EXAFS function, the first shell bond distance 
around Mn ions in the plane, i.e., the first 
peak in the amplitude at ~1.471 Å contains 
information of the Mn-O bond lengths in 
LBMO sublayers. The (LBMO60/LNO45)12 
superlattice shows the longest Mn-O bond 
length in the manganese sublayers and the 
(LBMO60/LNO15)12 exhibits the narrowest 
Mn-O bond length distribution. Strain in the 
thin film structure may contribute 
significantly to the distortion of MnO6 
orchestra in the manganese films17. The result 
of EXAFS indicated a different degree of 
in-plane compressive strain at the 
hetero-interface resulting in a varied Mn-O 
bond length distribution in LBMO sublayers 
for series of LBMO/LNO superlattices. On 
the other hand, the normalized Mn K-edge 
x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) 
for series of LBMO/LNO superlattices is 
shown in Fig. 4(b). There is no significant 
energy shift at the edge between the spectra 
collected in the plane revealing an indication 
of almost the same oxidation state of Mn 
atoms for LBMO sublayers in series of 
LBMO/LNO superlattices. The results of 
absorption experiments clearly demonstrate 
that the different degrees of lattice distortion 
were induced from heteroepitaxial strain 
among these superlattices.  
The Tc of LBMO/LNO superlattices 
having 15, 30, and 45 Å thick LNO spacers is 
195, 213, and 235K, respectively. That of 
single LBMO epilayer (720Å thick) is 266K 
(Fig.5). It is observed that Tc values for the 
series of superlattices are lower than that of 
the single LBMO epilayer. The compressive 
strain of the LBMO sublayer in the 
superlattice structure induces a measurable 
static anisotropic distortion of the MnO6 
octahedra in the LBMO sulayers. This 
distortion may lead to an increase of the 
splitting of the eg levels tending to localize the 
charge carriers and explains the decrease of 
the temperature of ferromagnetic transition 
observed in the superlattices with respect to 
the thin films.10,18 
5. Conclusions 
Strained epitaxial LBMO/LNO 
superlattices with alternating stack of the 
ferromagnetic LBMO sublayer and LNO 
spacer were successfully grown on SrTiO3 
(001) substrates by rf magnetron sputtering.
