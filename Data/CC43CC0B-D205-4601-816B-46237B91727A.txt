A. Basic Principle 
The basic principle of the PLPB model is to approximate 
the nonlinear I-V curve of the diode by 2h linear segments 
as shown in Fig. 2. The diode I-V curve for Vd between 
zero and the cell open-circuit voltage Voc is depicted in Fig. 
2. The curve is first approximated by two line segments 
(dotted lines) with their corner voltage E2. The curve to the 
left of E2 is again approximated by two segments with a 
corner voltage E1; and the portion to the right of E2 
approximated by another two segments with a corner 
voltage E3. Hence, the diode I-V curve is now 
approximated by four line segments (dashed lines) with 
three corner voltages E1, E2 and E3. This procedure 
continues until a required accuracy is obtained. It is noted 
that 2h line segments are used in the hth approximation step, 
and the larger the number h, the better the approximation.

B. Realization of Equivalent Circuit 
In Fig. 2, when the diode I-V curve is approximated by 
four line segments with corner voltages E1, E2 and E3, and 
their respective slopes m1, m2, m3 and m4, the piecewise 
linearized I-V relation can be represented by four linear 
branches in parallel as shown by Fig. 3. Each branch 
consists of an ideal diode, a resistance and a voltage source 
in serious. In Fig. 3 the voltage source E0 is actually zero. 
We draw E0 to make all the branches have the same circuit 
structure.  The resistances in Fig. 3 are related to the 
segment slopes by the following equations:

When Vd <0, Id = 0. When 10 dV E  , the diode of the 
first branch turns on. This state is represented by the 
segment between zero and E1. When 1 2dE V E  , the 
first and second branches conduct. This state is represented 
by the segment between E1 and E2. When 2 3dE V E  , 
the first ,second, and third branches turn on. This state is 
represented by the segment between E2 and E3. When 
3dV E , all branches turn on. This state is represented by 
the segment between E3 and Voc in Figure 2.

To generalize, we replace the diode in Fig. 1 with a 
k-branch diode equivalent circuit (k=2h). The result is 
shown in Fig. 4 which is the basic circuit configuration of 
the PLPB model for PV cell. The resistances in Fig. 4 have

C. Determination of Corner Voltages 
The resistances of the PLPB model are related to the 
slopes by (2) and (3). However, before all the slopes of line 
segments can be determined, we need to determine the 
corner voltages. An easiest way to determine the corner 
voltages E1, E2,...,Ek-1 is  to place them equally spaced 
over the interval of interest. In the case of Fig. 2, the 
interval was (0, Voc) but this can be changed according to 
our need. Equally spaced corner voltages do not allow the 
piecewise linear segments to best approximate the curve. In 
this report we propose a more efficient method that, for a 
given number of linear segments, allows a better 
approximation. 
Fig. 5 shows a known curve g(x) which is to be 
approximated by two linear segments L1(x) and L2(x) over 
the interval (xL, xR). The corner point xG needs to be 
determined. We propose an equal-area method that is to 
find xG so that the areas formed by the curve g(x) and the 
two line segments L1(x) and L2(x) are equal, i.e., A1=A2. 
The equal-area method has an advantage of fitting high 
curvature portion with shorter segment, which 
automatically improves the quality of approximation. We

with shading percentage from 0% to 100%, the simulated

B. Effect of the Number of Shaded Cells 
In a PV module composed of 36 cells in series, the 
number of shaded cells influences the module performance. 
In this section we study how the number of shaded cells 
affects the I-V curve of an array. The notations A and Bn 
used in [8] are also used in this report. They are briefly 
explained as follows: 
A: All the 36 cells are unshaded with G=1.0 kW/m2 and 
Tc=50 C . 
Bn: n cells are shaded with irradiance G=0.25 kW/m2 and 
Tc=50 C while (36-n) cells are unshaded with G=1.0 kW/m
2 
and Tc=50 C . Hence, B2 means the module has 2 shaded 
cells and 34 unshaded cells in series; B36 means all the 
cells are shaded, and so forth.  
The simulation result in Fig. 10 shows the I-V 
characteristic of a module with the number of shaded cells 
from zero to 36. For the effect of the number of shaded 
cells on array, we consider two cases. The first case is the 
shaded cells in the same module as shown in Fig. 11 where 
the right-most module has one, two and three shaded cells. 
The corresponding I-V curves are shown in Fig. 12 in 
which we observe that for this case the number of shaded 
cells does not affect the resulting maximum power point. In 
the second case, the shaded cells are located in different 
modules, and each module has at most one shaded cell, as 
shown in Fig. 13. The corresponding I-V curves are 
depicted in Fig. 14 where we can see that the number of 
shaded cells has significant influence on the maximum 
power point.

C. Effect of Bypass Diodes 
Bypass diodes are often used to prevent PV cells from 
detrimental effects of partial shading. The number of cells 
protected by a bypass diode must be limited to ensure PV 
cells against reverse over-voltage. In this section, we study 
the case of complete shading and assume parameters G=1.0 
kW/m2 and Tc=50 C  for unshaded cells and G=0 kW/m
2 
and Tc=25 C  for shaded cells. Fig. 15 shows two 
protection configurations [9]. In Fig. 15 (a), each bypass

IV. Conclusions 
A novel circuit-oriented PLPB model for PV cell has 
been presented in this report. It is based on piecewise linear 
parallel branches. The number of the branches can be 
adjusted to meet the required accuracy of simulation. An 
equal-area algorithm has also been proposed to determine 
the parameters of the PLPB model. The proposed PLPB 
model can easily be implemented in circuit simulation 
software to simulate power systems containing PV arrays. 
The EMTP has been used to show how the PLPB model is 
incorporated in the simulation program. 
Applications of the PLPB model have been presented in 
this report with emphasis placed on the analysis of partially 
shaded PV modules. Various problems associated with 
partial shading have been simulated using the PLPB model, 
including effects of shading percentage, effects of the 
number of shaded cells, and effects of bypass diodes. Also 
studied is a comparison of the performance of four 
connection configurations (i.e., SP, TCT, BL and HC) of 
PV cells at the presence of partial shading. All the 
applications show that the PLPB model is ease to use, 
flexible and accuracy. Further work on applications of the 
PLPB model to modeling a grid-interactive PV system is 
underway. The PLPB model has a great advantage that it 
allows a PV system to be seamlessly integrated with a large 
number of built-in power system components (e.g., motors, 
transformers, transmission lines/cables, switches, etc.) in 
the simulation software, which is an important feature in 
modeling and simulating grid-connected PV power 
systems.
