Abstract 
 
In this project, four topics are studied: (1) Modal 
Transition during the Wafering Process, (2) Abrasive 
Distribution of the Fixed Diamond Wire in Wire Sawing 
Process, (3) Modeling of the Slurry Wire Sawing 
Process, and (4) Rotational Testing Machine for the 
Wire in Wire Sawing Process. The results of the first 
topic show the transition of the natural frequencies and 
the vibration modes of the wafers during wafering 
process. It is possible that the natural frequency of the 
unfinished wafer will reach those of the cutting wire, 
which could result in the resonance and deteriorate the 
surface quality of the wafers. The results of the second 
topic show that the material removal rate will increase 
sharply when the material removal mechanism is from 
ductile to brittle with the increase of the abrasive interval. 
However, the increase will slow down with further 
increase of the abrasive interval. In addition, the force on 
each abrasive will also increase linearly with the 
abrasive interval. In the third research topic, a dynamic 
model of slurry wire sawing process is established. The 
results show that the increase of the wire will reduce 
both bow angle and local loadings. The fourth topic is an 
undergraduate practical project. In this project, the 
undergraduate students build up a rotary testing machine 
for the wire in wire sawing process. This machine, which 
won the first prize in the 2012 practical project 
competition of mold and precision machine, can be 
utilized to study the mechanical property of the wire. In 
this project, the publication includes one journal paper, 
two international conference papers, and one national 
conference paper. In addition, the supported

1. Introduction 
 
The wafer substrate manufacturing process includes 
crystal growth, slicing ingot into wafers, lapping or 
grinding to remove subsurface damage, and polishing to 
achieve the requirement of surface quality. Wire saw has 
been utilized in the slicing process of prime wafer 
manufacturing over 20 years [1, 2]. It becomes the 
exclusive slicing tool because of the advantages such as 
low kerf loss and high yield. In addition, it can slice 
almost any sizes of ingot with the adjustment of wire 
span between wire guides. Therefore, it is expected that 
the wire saw will still be the major tool to slice 450 mm 
silicon ingot in the near future [3]. In addition to silicon, 
it is also utilized in the slicing of sapphire, SiC, and 
almost all kinds of materials. Wire saws can be divided 
into two types, slurry wire saw and fixed diamond wire 
saw. Slurry wire saw was introduced into the industry to 
replace the inner diameter saw for lager wafers[1]. 
During slicing, the slurry is sprayed on the wire net and 
brought into the slicing zone. The abrasives are 
suspended in the film between the wire and the ingot. 
The material removal mechanism is three-body abrasion. 
However, the used slurry has to be disposed, and this is 
not benign to the environment.  
1 
The penetration of the abrasive into the workpiece 
depends on the geometry of the abrasive, the normal 
loading, and the hardness of the workpiece, as shown in 
Fig. 4. Assume that the tip of the abrasive is a cone with 
tip angle of       . In the model of plowing, the 
normal force required to penetrate the workpiece is 
       
 
 
                                                           
where   is the horizontal projected area, and   is the 
hardness of the workpiece. The tangent force required to 
move the abrasive forward is 
           
  
    
   
where   is the vertical projected area, and   is the 
pressure to deform the workpiece plastically. This 
pressure   is considered as the same as the hardness   
[12]. Therefore, 
  
  
    
                                                                          
The projected areas are defined in Fig. 4. 
 
 
Figure 4  Mechanism of conical abrasive wear. 
 
Once the normal loading is less than the critical 
loading, the mechanism of material removal can be 
assumed as the abrasive plowing process [12]. In this 
case, the material removal rate for each abrasive can be 
consider as the vertical projected area, which is that

where   is the material removal rate with the unit of the 
material removal volume per unit sliding distance. If the 
normal loading is over the critical value, the material 
above the lateral cracks will be considered as being 
removed, and the material removal rate will be  
       [    ]                                                               
where   is the length of the lateral crack, and   is the 
depth of the lateral crack, as shown in Fig. 3. They can 
be obtained by the following equations [13, 14].

Force Analysis 
The wire utilized in the wire sawing process is 
flexible, and the configuration of the wire, as well as the 
bottom of the slicing groove, is a curve rather than a 
straight line. In this study, the configuration of the 
bottom of the slicing groove is assumed as an arc with an 
arc angle defined by the bow angles of the wire, as 
shown in Fig. 5. 
 
 
Figure 5  Configuration of the wire and slicing groove. 
 
The normal loads are introduced from the wire to 
the abrasives, which penetrate the workpiece. The values 
of these loads depend on the average interval of the 
abrasives and the tension of the wire. In this study, only 
one dimensional problem is investigated, as shown in 
Fig. 5. Therefore, the number of abrasives can be defined 
according to the slicing length,  , and the average 
interval of the diamond abrasives,  , which is 
   
 
 
 
when the bow angle is very small. 
The wire is assumed to be stretched by the tension 
on it. The tensions can be divided into normal force and 
tangent force. The normal force will provide the load for 
the abrasives to penetrate into the workpiece, and the 
tangent force is the force required to overcome the 
strength of the workpiece to move forward. The wire 
tension and its fractions around an abrasive grit are 
shown in Fig. 6. For the i
th
 abrasive grit, the wire tension 
on the left is   , and the wire tension on the right is 
    . The normal force is 
3 
the feed rate is 5 m/s, the wire tension is 20 N, the wire 
speed is 10 m/s, and the cracks were initiated 
immediately once the load reaches 0.03 N. If the material 
removal is two dimensional, each effective indentation 
would remove the material of hc×2cc, and the following 
equation should be satisfied. 
 
k×100 (abrasives) × 199,000 (indentations/s) × hc×2cc 
= 5 (feedrate, m/s)×100,000 (m, length of the slicing) 
(9) 
 
where hc = 25.44P
1/2
 mm and cc = 7.50P
5/8
 mm are the 
critical cracking depth and length. Substitute into 
equation (9) with P = 0.03. The probability k can be 
obtained as k = 0.0034. Therefore, the number of the 
effective indentations of one abrasive is 677 per second. 
Because the average interval of the abrasives is 1000 m, 
the number of indentation required to remove a layer of 
material with the depth of hc is 1000/(2cc) = 596.4. 
Therefore, the time required to remove a layer of 
material is dt = 596.4/677= 0.88 second, which is the 
interval of time steps for the simulation to evaluate the 
normal loads on the abrasives. The parameters and 
values obtained in this section were considered as the 
benchmark for the simulation. 
According to the analysis discussed in this section, a 
program was developed to study the wire sawing process 
under the conditions of wire tension T = 20 N, wire 
speed V =10 m/s, and feed rate f = 5 m/s. The time 
interval under these conditions was dt = 0.88 s. 
Therefore, in each time step, the height of the ingot 
would increase 0.88×5 = 4.4 m. The width of the ingot 
is divided into 100 elements, and each has the length of 1 
mm, as shown in Fig. 8. In each time step, the normal 
force on each node was analyzed based on the deviation 
of the wire slopes on the node. The slopes of the wire 
were changed according to the different heights of the 
nodes, as shown in Fig. 9. The discontinuance of the 
slopes at the contact point provides the normal load to 
the workpiece through the abrasive. Two more nodes 
were set for the ends of the wire, and they are always at 
the heights of zero. Because the deviations of slopes are 
normally very small, the loads on the abrasives are 
assumed as the magnitudes of the addition of the wire 
tension vectors in the front and at the back of the contact 
points. If the normal force P ≥ 0.03 N, the height of the 
node will be reduced by equation (3) because of the 
removed material. The simulation parameters and results 
under these parameters were considered as the 
benchmark. Once the wire speed increases, the interval 
of time steps will decrease correspondingly because of 
the increase of the indentations within a unit time. 
 
 
Figure 8  Nodes of the workpiece and the decreasing 
slopes from the left to the right of the wire. 
 
 
Figure 9  Vectors of the tensions and the normal load at 
the contact point. 
 
Another important consideration in the model is the 
variation of the slope of the wire. During slicing process, 
the slopes of the wire segments may change because the 
depths of indentation cracks reduce the heights of the 
nodes locally. However, because of the tension of the 
wire, the slopes should keep decreasing from the left of 
the wire to the right, as shown in Fig. 8. Note that if a 
node is lower than the adjacent ones, the wire should not 
contact with it. A loop in the program was set to check if 
the slopes were decreasing. 
 
2.4 Rotary Testing Machine 
In order to obtain the mechanical properties of the 
steel wire in wire sawing process, the tensile test and 
rotary test are necessary. However, the commercial 
testing machines are not specified for the tiny wire. The 
wire utilized in wire sawing process is normally from 
120 to 250 m in diameter for different purposes. 
Therefore, in this practical project, the undergraduate 
students established a small rotary testing machine for 
the tiny wire.They built up the structure of the machine 
and developed the circuit board and control algorithm by 
themselves. The assembly drawing and finished machine 
are shown in Figs. 10 and 11.

The mechanical properties of the silicon utilized in 
this study are listed in Table 2. The simulation compares 
the average abrasive interval and the total material 
removal rate. In addition, the wire tension at exit is also 
investigated. However, the results show that the abrasive 
interval does not affect the wire tension at exit 
significantly. Figure 14 shows an example with the 
initial wire tension of 20 N and the wire bow angle of 5°. 
In Fig. 15, the material removal rate is compared 
with different bow angles. The results show that with 
larger bow angle, the material removal rate is higher. In 
addition, there is a transition of material removal rate at 
certain abrasive interval. The material removal rate 
increases dramatically when the average abrasive 
interval is larger than a critical value. However, this 
value depends on the slicing parameters such as bow 
angle and wire tension. This transition also presents the 
mechanism of material removal is from plastic 
deformation to brittle indentation cracking. Although the 
plastic deformation can eliminate the subsurface damage 
resulting from the cracking, the material removal rate 
with plastic deformation is much lower than that with 
brittle indentation cracking. For example, the material 
removal rate with abrasive interval of 115 m is 
            (    ) with the wire tension of 20 N 
and the bow angle of 5°, as shown in Fig. 15. However, 
it is            (    ) with abrasive interval of 
130 m. Figure 16 shows the simulation results of 
material removal rate with different wire tensions at the 
entry. The results show that the higher wire tension will 
result in higher material removal rate, and there is also a 
transition of the material removal mechanism.

abrasive interval. The wire tension at the entry is 20 N,

The force acts on the abrasive which is closest to 
the exit is also study compared to the average abrasive 
interval as shown in Figs. 17 and 18. The results show 
that the relationship between the force on the abrasive 
and the average abrasive interval is linear. However, the 
corresponding material removal rates in Figs. 15 and 16 
approach certain steady-state limits. The diamond 
abrasive can come off the wire with larger force acting 
on it. Therefore, the abrasive interval is an important 
factor which affects the slicing performance manifold.

4. Conclusions 
 
In this project, four topics are studied: (1) Modal 
Transition during the Wafering Process, (2) Abrasive 
Distribution of the Fixed Diamond Wire in Wire Sawing 
Process, (3) Modeling of the Slurry Wire Sawing 
Process, and (4) Rotary Testing Machine for the Wire in 
Wire Sawing Process. There are total on journal paper, 
two international conference papers, and one national 
conference paper published. In addition, the rotary 
testing machine won the first prize in the 2012 
undergraduate practical project competition of mold and 
precision machine. 
The research results show that the vibration of the 
wafer during slicing could be excited when it is resonant 
with the cutting wire. The distribution of diamond grit of 
the fixed diamond wire can affect the performance of 
fixed diamond wire sawing process with difference 
abrasive interval. When it reaches certain interval, the 
material removal mechanism will transfer form ductile to 
brittle, and the material removal rate will increase 
sharply. However, further increase of abrasive interval

is difficult to observe the details of the slicing process. The steel
wire utilized in slicing is about 120 to 140 µm in diameter cur-
rently [13], and the SiC slurry is opaque. For brittle material, the
material removal mechanism is considered as indentation crack-
ing [8, 9]. The material removal happens locally. However, the
overall slicing performance is a combination of these local ma-
chining behaviors. The flexible wire may changes its configura-
tion during the slicing process due to these indentation cracks. In
order to study how the wire changes its configuration and the lo-
cal loads on the workpiece and the wire, a preliminary numerical
study was conducted and is presented in this paper.
REVIEW OF THE MACHINING MECHANISM OF BRIT-
TLE MATERIALS
In the free abrasive machining of brittle materials, the ma-
chining mechanisms can be divided into four types: two-body
brittle machining, two-body ductile machining, three-body brit-
tle machining, and three-body ductile machining [14]. Although
the ductile-regime machining of brittle material is attractive for
its advantage of the limitation of subsurface damages, it re-
quires precise control and is still not feasible for global planariza-
tion [15]. Therefore, the mechanism of indentation crack is still
considered as the main reason of the material removal in wire
sawing and lapping processes [8, 9, 14].
Indentation with a sharp tip will introduce the cracks inside
the brittle material. The cracks are divided into the radial, me-
dian, and lateral cracks [16–18]. The lateral cracks are consid-
ered to contribute to the material removal in the machining pro-
cess. However, the radial and median cracks leave the surface
and subsurface damages after machining. Figure 1 shows a sys-
tem of brittle indentation cracks.
In Fig. 1, c is the length of lateral crack, and h is the depth.
The material above the lateral cracks is considered as the re-
moved chips. Therefore, the volume of the removed material in a
TABLE 1. PROPERTIES OF THE SILICON UTILIZED IN THE
MODEL.

E = 127 GPa H = 10 GPa KC = 0.7 MPa
single indentation is pic2h [14,19]. In order to initiate the cracks,
a critical normal load is required. When the normal load on the
abrasive is larger than the critical one, a chip will be produced as
removed material. An experiment done by Mo¨ller showed that
the critical normal load is 0.03 N for a SiC abrasive indenting on
the silicon surface [9].
The lengths of the cracks with normal loading, P, are rela-
tive to the mechanical properties of the brittle workpiece as fol-
lows [16, 17].

where E is the Young’s modulus, H is the hardness, KC is the
fracture toughness of the brittle workpiece, ψ is the half angle
of the indenting tip, ζL = 25× 10−3, and A = 3/4. The SiC
abrasives are assumed as rigid bodies and have the edge angle
of 2ψ = 140◦ [20, 21]. The properties of silicon utilized in this
study are listed in Table 1. Substitute these parameters into equa-
tion (1) and (2). The relationship between the loading and the
cracks can be obtained as follows:
h = 25.44P1/2 µm (3)
and
c = 7.50P5/8 µm (4)
where the unit of P is newton (N). With the critical normal load-
ing Pc = 0.03 N, the critical cracking lengths are hc = 4.406 µm
and cc = 0.838 µm.

these parameters were considered as the benchmark. Once the
wire speed increases, the interval of time steps will decrease cor-
respondingly because of the increase of the indentations within a
unit time.
Another important consideration in the model is the varia-
tion of the slope of the wire. During slicing process, the slopes of
the wire segments may change because the depths of indentation
cracks reduce the heights of the nodes locally. However, because
of the tension of the wire, the slopes should keep decreasing from
the left of the wire to the right, as shown in Fig. 3. Note that if a
node is lower than the adjacent ones, the wire should not contact
with it. A loop in the program was set to check if the slopes were
decreasing.
SIMULATION RESULTS
The parameters and values obtained in the previous section
are summarized in Table 2. The simulated time was 17,600 s.
Therefore, the total steps were 20,000. Figure 5(b) shows the
simulation results when the slicing process reaches steady-state.
The bow angle of the wire is about 8.6◦, which is higher than
the normal operation of 1◦ ∼ 5◦. The reason is because this
model only considers the indentation cracks as the material re-
moval mechanism. Other possible mechanisms such as plowing
and erosion are not included.
Figure 6 shows the average normal loads and their standard
deviations at different nodes. The results show that while the in-
got approaches the wire before the steady-state condition, the av-
erage normal loads at the edges are much higher than those at the

middle. Once it reaches steady state, the average normal loads
are about the same values. However, the loads at the outermost
edges have obvious lower average values than the others.
In order to study the performance of the slurry wire sawing
process, other conditions were investigated by changing the pa-
rameters in Table 2. Three feed rates, 2 µm/s, 5 µm/s, and 8
µm/s were studied. In addition, another wire speed, 20 m/s, was
also employed by changing the interval of time steps to 0.44 s.
Therefore, the total time steps would become double compared
to the wire speed of 10 m/s. The steady-state simulation results
are listed in Table 3. In Table 4, another wire tension, 10 N, was
studied.

different approaches to reach steady-state condition of the wire
sawing process. The first one in Fig. 7(a) is overshooting. This
is because the lower feed rate requires more time to reach steady
state. The machining starts at the edges and propagates into the
center of the workpiece. The deviations of the slopes at the mid-
dle range are not sufficient to remove the material continuously
and stably. Once the middle range starts to remove material ef-
fectively, the height of the center of the ingot drops to the steady-
state position. In contrast, the higher feed rate results in higher
normal loads on the abrasives. A faster material removal propa-
gates from the edges into the center of the workpiece. Therefore,
the height of the center is not over the steady-state position dur-
ing the slicing, as shown in Fig. 7(b).
In Table 3, it shows that the increase of feed rate will in-
crease the average loads at the middle of the workpiece and the
bow angles of the wire with the same wire speed and wire ten-
sion. In addition, the average loads at the middle of the work-
piece and bow angles of the wire will decrease with the increase
of wire speed. It is expected that the higher wire speed will in-
troduce more effective indentations within a unit time during the
slicing process. Therefore, the loads and bow angles should not
vary as much as those with lower wire speed. The lower average
loads and bow angles indicate that the indentation cracks initiate
immediately once the critical load reaches 0.03 N, and this keeps
the lower loads on both the wire and the workpiece and the lower
bow angles. Table 4 lists the results with another wire tension,
T = 10 N, and the wire speed is 10 m/s. Comparing to the results
in Table 3, it shows that the lower wire tension increases the bow
angles. However, the average loads are only slight lower.
The simulation results show that the higher wire speed and
wire tension can reduce bow angles, and the higher wire speed
and lower wire tension can reduce the average normal loads. In
addition to the wafer surface quality, another concern of the slic-
ing process is the productivity. Therefore, the higher feed rate is
desirable. However, the higher feed rate will increase the bow
angle of the wire, which is considered as the risky index during
slicing. If there is any sharp asperity in the cutting zone, it could
result in the force concentration and rupture the wire. The higher
wire speed and higher wire tension also make the wire more sen-
sible to the sharp asperities or locally sticky conditions in the
cutting zone.
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a preliminary numerical model was developed
to study the local and gross slurry wire sawing process for sili-
con wafers. In this model, the simulation results showed that the
parameters including wire tension, wire speed, and feed rate af-
fect the slicing process significantly. The increase of wire speed
is suggested to lower the bow angle and normal loads. However,
the limit of the wire speed depends on the material of the wire
and the specification wire saw machine. In addition, slicing pro-
cess will reach the steady-state slicing condition by two different
approaches, overshooting or non-overshooting. This depends on
the interaction of the slicing parameters. Although this model
only considered the indentation cracks, the simulation results il-
lustrate the complicated phenomena of slurry wire sawing pro-
cess qualitatively.
