Abstract 
This research explores a bi-criteria economic model for determining the optimal quality level 
setting of a key item production, and choosing the inspection sampling plan for a two-echelon 
supply chain process. The model objectives are to maximize the total profit of the upstream supplier 
and the downstream producer, and at the same time ensure that the difference between their 
respective earnings is within a reasonable range. This collaborative production strategy can ensure 
that both sides obtain satisfactory returns and maintain a longer partnership. In this supply chain, 
the supplier determines the item quality by selecting a quality level of process setup, as well as the 
cycle time to reset this quality level. There is a tradeoff between total setup cost and the resulting 
item quality. Two distributions, interrupted geometric and discretized interrupted exponential, are 
used to describe the item manufacturing quality based on various parameters. On the other hand, the 
producer will adopt an inspection sampling policy before sending the purchased items to his 
assembly line. Furthermore, it is assumed that the production process will deteriorate, and the 
inspection is imperfect. The supplier must bear the loss for his downstream producer’s type I 
inspection error, but the producer will in turn undertake the risk of sending flawed products to 
customers. The application of the proposed model is illustrated via two examples. 
Keywords: Interrupted geometric distributions, Discretized interrupted distributions, Inspection 
sampling plans, Imperfect inspection, Deterioration effect, Bayesian approach 
1. Introduction 
The issue of parameters setting for product manufacturing processes has been extensively 
studied since 1962 [1]. Hunter and Kartha [2], and Bisgarrd et al. [3] discussed a case when a failed 
product could be sold at a discount value. Golhar [4] brought forth a model considering the 
compensation of failed products sent to customers. [5,6] studied a profit maximization problem on 
quality level setting for filling processes. Elsayed and Chen [7] addressed the issue of optimizing 
the process parameter setting for products with multiple characteristics. 
In 1975, Wetherill [8] proposed an inspection sampling plan that takes into account economic 
effects. Aminzadeh [9], Fink and Margavio [10], William et al. [11], and Moskowitz and Tang [12] 
followed the aforementioned concept and established various sampling plans based on Bayesian 
approach. 
In this research, we propose a bi-objective profit maximization model involving manufacturing 
process quality level setup and inspection sampling policy for two-echelon production processes. 
The proposed model considers machine deterioration and imperfect inspection. The primary 
objective is to maximize the total profit of the upstream and downstream manufacturers, whereas 
the secondary objective is to limit the gap between the individual profits of the two manufacturers.

where rC  is the critical number between decisions Sn and CN.. 
Three distributions with various parameters are chosen to represent different setups of the 
process quality levels.  
1. Interrupted geometric distribution (IG) 
2. Discretized interrupted exponential distribution (DIEx) 
3. Discretized interrupted Weibull distribution (DIWb) 
For IG, let rx be the yield rate of the first item with respect to x quality level setup. Then, the 
probability of t good items under cycle time T will be Pr{GT = t} = (1 )tx xr r⋅ − ，t = 1, 2,…, T; Pr{ GT 
= T} = Pr{ GT ≥ T} = Txr . Here we assume that each item takes one unit time to produce. 
The average yield rate for cycle time T is as follows:

of its counterpart in case 1. However, the standard deviation of this case varies at a wider range than 
that of case 1. 
In case 2, the maximum profit is found at λ1 = 500 and T = 25. However, if δ is set to 10%, the 
optimal choice will be λ1 = 500 and T = 50, and the optimal sample size n* = 3. In case 3, the 
optimal choice is (ω, γ) = (1, 5), T = 50, and the optimal size n* = 3.
