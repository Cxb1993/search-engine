introducing the T-complete functions as the 
weight functions. In this regard, the T-Trefftz 
method is sometimes viewed as the 
eigenfunction expansion method since the 
T-complete functions are the eigenfunctions. 
Due to the limited use of one source point 
(Trefftz origin), the T-Trefftz method cannot deal 
with a multiply connected domain with genus of 
. In contrast, the F-Trefftz method 
constructs its basis function space by allowing 
many source points (Trefftz points) outside the 
interested domain to keep basis functions regular. 
For each source point, only one function known 
as the fundamental solution is adopted; therefore, 
this method is also called as the method of 
fundamental solution (MFS) and it has been 
widely applied to many fields of physical 
problem. Due to its singular-free and meshless 
merits in the solver, the indirect type F-Trefftz 
method is commonly used. In indirect 
formulation, the solution is approximated by 
basis functions provided by the fundamental 
solutions from source points. The linear equation 
then is obtained by means of satisfying the 
boundary condition at the boundary collocation 
points. It means that the use of element is not 
necessary; therefore, such a method can be 
categorized into a meshless method one.

    Since both of the two Trefftz formulations 
are regular type, no singular integral is 
encountered in the solving procedure. However, 
such a regular characteristic leads to some 
drawbacks. The most serious one is the ill-posed 
behavior, i.e., the numerical instability. In 
previous publications [9-11], we have found that 
the T-Trefftz method encounters the numerical 
instability for solving the Helmholtz equation. It 
has been reported that [12-16] the condition 
number for the influencing matrix of the 
F-Trefftz method is very large. It means that 
possible numerical instability may happen. 
    The T-Trefftz method has been used to 
solve the Poisson equation by Kita et al. [17]. 
Further, Balakrishnan and Ramachandran [18] 
used the F-Trefftz method to solve the nonlinear 
Poisson problems. Basically, they all used the 
techniques of finding the particular solution first 
and then to solve the resulting Laplace equation 
by means of the Trefftz method. In Kita’s paper, 
the particular solution was approximated by the 
polynomials. On the other hand, Balakrishnan 
and Ramachandran used the radial basis 
functions to approximate the particular solution. 
Kita did not report the numerical instability in 
his paper but Balakrishnan and Ramachandran 
mentioned the possibility. However, both of 
these two papers did not really propose any 
remedy to deal with this difficulty. 
    In our previous papers, we have used the 
Tikhonov’s regularization technique [19] in 
conjunction with the L-curve concept [20] to 
deal with the numerical instability. The 
numerical instability can be treated in many 
ways, for example, the Tikhonov’s regularization 
technique, the truncated singular value 
decomposition [21] and so on. However, most 
numerical instabilities occur in the inverse 
problem. The reason why the numerical 
instability in Trefftz method is encountered is 
owing to the fact that the formulation is 
categorized into the Fredholm integral equation 
of the first kind, which is well known to have 
numerical instability [22-24]. Details of the 
numerical instability along with the remedy will 
be discussed later. 
    This chapter focuses on the following folds: 
(1). to discuss the numerical instability and then 
to propose its remedy suitable for the T- and 
F-Trefftz methods; 
(2). to discuss why the T-Trefftz method cannot 
handle with a multiply connected domain 
with genus of ; )1( >pp
(3). to examine phenomenon occurred while 
solving the Helmholtz equation as a Poisson 
equation.

4. Numerical Examples 
 
[Example 1] In this example, a multiply 
connected domain with genus of 2 is examined. 
The origin is located at the geometric center of 
the domain. The radius of the outer circular 
curve is equal to 2.0, and the radius for two inner 
circular boundaries is equal to 0.5. The location 
for the centers of two circular holes are (0.7,0.7) 
and (-0.7,-0.7). The problem be solved is 
. The boundary conditions 
are the Dirichlet type and are given by designing 
the exact solution as . As 
mentioned earlier that the T-Trefftz method fails 
in dealing with a multiply connected domain 
with genus of . The reason comes 
from the bad descriptions for boundary 
quantities when only one source point is used. In 
the multiply connected domain with genus of 1, 
the T-Trefftz method is located the source point 
inside the hole. When dealing with a multiply 
connected domain with genus of , it 
then becomes puzzling where should one locate 
the source point for the T-Trefftz method. 
Theoretically speaking, no matter where we 
locate the source point the enough basis 
functions can be set up. In numerical reality, the 
location of source point for the T-Trefftz method 
influences the accuracy of the numerical 
calculation. The boundary quantities with source 
point nearby always can be better expressed. 
However, the result is still not acceptable after 
all. From this experience, it casts a light our 
mind that to arrange source points nearby whole 
boundary is more suitable to reduce the 
numerical instability. It then can be expected that 
the F-Trefftz method can solve the difficulty of 
dealing with a multiply connected domain with 
genus of  since it allows as many 
source points along the boundary as one 
requires.

    The number of source points used in this 
example is 42. Twenty-two of them are on a 
fictitious circular curve, which encloses the outer 
circular boundary, with radius equal 2.2. Ten 
sources are on the fictitious circular curve, 
which is enclosed by the inner circular boundary, 
with radius equal to 0.3. The numerical result in 
Figure 2 shows that the F-Trefftz method can 
successfully treat a multiply connected domain 
with genus of . )1( >pp
 
[Example 2] In this example, a square region 
with edge length equal to 2 is examined for the 
analysis of a non-linear case. The coordinates of 
the left-bottom corner and right-top corner are 
(-1,-1) and (1,1). The problem to be solved is ( ) 22 6, uxyxu +=∇ . The boundary 
conditions of the Dirichlet type are given along 
the boundary and .the exact solution for this 
problem is . The basis 
functions used are the same as those in the 
example 1 and totally 31 basis functions are 
adopted. The T-Trefftz method with the 
treatment on the numerical instability is used. 
The source point is located at the geometric 
center of the domain, (0.0,0.0). The purpose of 
illustrating this example is to support our claim
