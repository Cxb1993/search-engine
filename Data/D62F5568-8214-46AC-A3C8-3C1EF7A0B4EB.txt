startup times. Upon returning from a vacation, if 
customers are accumulated in the system, the server 
is immediately turned on but is temporarily 
unavailable to serve the waiting customers. He needs 
a startup time before providing service. If no 
customers are in the queue, the server may take 
another vacation with probability p or go into idle 
state with probability 1?p until the next customer 
arrives. Such a pattern continues until the number of 
vacations reaches J. Based on the generating function 
and supplementary variable technique, system 
characteristics such as system size distributions of 
states, the mean lengths of various state periods are 
derived. The customer’s waiting time in the system 
is also obtained.

Choudhury et al. [16] derived various system performance measures and a simple procedure to 
obtain the optimal stationary policy under a linear cost structure for an M[x]/G/1 unreliable server 
queue with two phases of service and Bernoulli vacation schedule. Choudhury and Ke [17] dealt 
with the steady state behavior of an M[x]/G/1 queue with general retrial time and Bernoulli vacation 
schedule for an unreliable server, which consists of a breakdown period and delay period. 
Corresponding to continuous time queues, discrete-time queues where the inter-arrival time and 
service time are positive integer random variables have been analyzed and are more suitable to 
model and analyze the digital communication system (see Meisling [18], Hunter [19], Bruneel and 
Kim [20], Takagi [21], and Woodward [22]). An excellent and complete study on discrete-time 
queueing systems with vacations has been presented by Takagi [21]. Zhang and Tian [23] 
investigated a Geo/G/1 queue with multiple adaptive vacations. Tian and Zhang [24] analyzed a 
GI/Geo/1 queueing system with multiple vacations by matrix-geometric solution method and Li and 
Tian [25] used the same method to study a GI/Geo/1 queueing system with working vacation and 
vacation interruption. Wang et al. [26] studied the discrete-time Geo/G/1 queue with randomized 
vacations and at most J vacations. Server breakdowns are a natural and useful abstraction of 
temporary server unavailability caused by external factors. Similarly, the server needs some time to 
be started up before beginning the first service in each cycle, and some time for shutting down the 
server after completing a service which leaves no customers in the system. Like these events often 
occurs in the real world. So far, very few authors dealt with the discrete-time queues about these 
issues. Moreno [27] analysed a Geo/G/1 system with a generalized N-policy and setup-closedown. 
Later Moreno [28] discussed the system performances and presented the numerical study of the cost 
function for a Geo/G/1 system under multiple vacations and setup-closedown times. Recently, 
Atencia et al. [29] examined a discrete-time Geo/G/1 retrial queue with server breakdowns. Wang 
and Zhang [30] treated a discrete-time single-server retrial queue with geometrical arrivals of both 
positive and negative customers in which the server is subject to breakdowns and repairs. To the 
best of my knowledge, the existing studies have never covered cases that an unreliable server with 
randomized finite vacation policy and server startup-closedown times. This motivates me to study 
an unreliable Geo/G/1 queue with server breakdowns and startup-closedown times, where the server 
operates a with at most J−1 vacations of Bernoulli schedule after an essential vacation. 
2. Model description  
We consider a discrete-time queue with a single-server where the time axis is divided into 
constant length intervals (called slots) and all queueing activities occur only at the boundaries of 
slots. Let the time axis be marked by 0, 1,…,n,…. we adopt the LAS policy with delayed access and 
1x x   for any real number . [0,1]x
Customers arrive according to a Bernoulli process with rate   in each slot. The service times 
of the customers are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to a general 
probability mass function (PMF)  with probability generating function (PGF) 1}{ iib

At the end of a closedown time, if there are customers in the system, the server immediately starts

instant that complete the service. That is, the completion time includes possible repair time. Let

5. Waiting time 
  When a customer will enter a service system, the most one of concerns is his spending time in 
the queue (system). In this section, we provide the waiting time distributions in the queue and in the 
system. The waiting time in the queue in the slot n +1 as the time that a customer would wait in the 
referred system if it arrived in the slot n +1. Thus, the waiting time in the system that a customer 
arrived in the slot n +1 is the sum of the waiting time in the system in the slot n +1 plus the service 
time.

6. Conclusions 
This paper presented a complete analysis of an unreliable Geo/G/1 queue with startup and 
closedown times under randomized vacations and at most J vacations. The distributions of system 
queue length of various server states were derived. Some important performance characteristics 
such as the mean lengths of turned-off, startup, busy, breakdown and closedown periods were also 
obtained. When a customer enters a service system, one of the most important issues is his spending 
time in the system. The analytical solutions for the distributions and the mean waiting time in 
system (queue) were derived and the result confirmed Little’s formula.

Abstract--This paper studies a discrete-time Geo/G/1 queue, in which the server operates a random 
N-policy. As soon as the system becomes empty, the server waits in the system until the system size 
reaches a random number N. Based on the probability generating function and supplementary 
variable technique, closed form expressions of system characteristics of interest such system size, 
idle period, busy period, busy cycle and sojourn time are derived. Furthermore, it is shown that the 
system size of a continuous-time random N-policy M/G/1 queue can be approximated by the 
presented discrete-time model. The most important one of the reasons to employ a control policy in 
queueing systems is to manage the system economically. A cost model is constructed and some 
examples of the optimal parameter about the random variable N that minimizes the expected cost 
function are also presented. 
 
Keywords: N-policy; System size; Busy cycle; Sojourn time; Cost   
 
1. Introduction 
The controllable queueing systems have been widely applied in the fields of 
manufacturing/production systems, communication networks, computer systems and etc. One of the 
most popular controllable queues is the N-policy queues. According to the N-policy, the server is 
idle until the queue length reaches a fixed threshold N, at that moment the server is immediately 
 3
(1994). To my best knowledge, the discrete-time case of N-policy that is a random variable has 
never been studied. In the real situation, the number N may vary depending on different instances of 
the operation of the system.  
Such a model can be applied to explore the managerial insights on optimal decisions with 
application to the cloud computing service center. Recently, cloud computing is a new cost-efficient 
computing paradigm in which information and computer power can be accessed from a Web 
browser by customers. This model consists of the cloud architecture and a service center. The cloud 
is a single point of access for the computing needs of the customers being serviced through a Web 
browser. The service center is a collection of service resources used by a service provider to host 
service applications for customers. A service request sent by a user is transmitted the service center 
that are owned by the service provider over network.  
We consider a machine offering a computing service in the cloud environment. The machine is 
turned on remotely under the scheme “wake-on-lane”. The server can be a mainframe with 
powerful computing capability. When the server is turned off, with the traditional N-policy, the 
computing service is started after accumulation of a certain number requests and serves 
exhaustively the queue until it empties. The server is then switched off and remains idle until N 
customers are accumulated again in the queue. Given the costs of computing service and having 
customers waiting in the queue, an optimal value of N can be determined that minimizes the 
expected cost of operating the queue. This policy operates well when the requests are similar. 
However, both the characteristics of requests and the computing environment are varied. Hence, a 
dynamic operating policy is needed for this real problem. That is, upon emptying the queue, the 
server decides on a random number N of customers that it has to wait before it is switched back on. 
With the dynamic N-policy, to study the cost function about the random variable N is an interesting 
issue. 
The objectives of this paper are as follows. Firstly, the important system characteristics for the 
random N-policy Geo/G/1 queue are developed, such as the expected number of customers, the 
expected length of the idle and busy. Secondly, we obtain the explicit form for the expected sojourn 
of a customer in the queue and confirm the little formula. Thirdly, the system size of a 
continuous-time random N-policy M/G/1 queue can be approximated by the presented discrete-time 
model. Finally, a cost model is constructed and some examples of the optimal parameter about the 
distributions of the random variable N that minimizes the expected cost function are also presented. 
2. The Model  
In this paper, we consider the random N-policy Geo/G/1 queue, where N is a random variable.

3.2. Stationary distribution of the server state 
    Let us define the following 
IP  the probability that the server is idle; 
BP  the probability that the server is turned on (working); 
0P  the probability that the system is empty. 
Substituting (12) into (7) and (10) yields  
  (1) 1I IP G    ,                               (14)

3.3. The expected system size and sojourn time in the system 
Differentiating  in (13) and setting )(zS 1z  , we note that the numerator and denominator 
are both 0. Based on L’Hospital’s rule twice, the expected system size is given by

systems is to manage the system economically. Define the cost as follows: 
hc = holding cost per unit time for each customer present in the system; 
sc = setup cost for per busy cycle; 
ic = cost per unit time for keeping the server off; 
bc = cost per unit time for keeping the server on and in operation; 
Therefore, the total expected cost function per unit time is given by

Next, we consider some distributions of the random variable N and by way of handling the 
parameters of these distributions, the minimum expected cost function is achieved.  
Assume random variable N obeys a geometric distribution with parameter  , then

6. Conclusions 
 In this work, we investigated a Geo/G/1 queue with the random N-policy. The analytical results 
of the system performances for the random N-policy Geo/G/1 queue were derived. The expected 
cost function per unit time was constructed and based on the parameters of the distributions of the 
random variable N, we obtained the explicit closed forms that minimized the cost function.

我們分析系統狀態發展並獲得各種狀態下系統大小分配的機率生成函數，同時推導出重要

意，主要因離散型時間的排隊模式特別適合用來描述關數位電腦與通訊系統中，有著傳輸
協定封包化特性的網路系統，如以非同步傳輸模式(ATM)技術為基礎之行動與寬頻網路。
在排隊系統中的休假被歸類為利用服務者的閒置時間對服務者進行一些附帶的工作，諸如
保養或派遣服務者到另一系統進行服務，研究之成果不同於存在之文獻，在於我們考慮有

要啟動(暖機)時間，當所有在系統中之訊息被服務完成，服務者需要停機時間，再者服務
