maximum inelastic displacement demand of 
SDOF systems from the maximum 
displacement demand of linear elastic SDOF 
systems (Moehle, 1992; Kowalsky et al., 
1995; Calvi and Kingsley, 1995; Priestley, 
1996; Miranda, 1999; Chopra and Goel, 1999; 
and Fajfar, 2000). Miranda and Ruiz-Garcia 
(2002) evaluated six approximate methods to 
estimate the maximum inelastic displacement 
demand of SDOF systems where four of 
which are based from equivalent 
linearization and the other two are based 
from displacement modifying factor. The 
coefficient C1 of coefficient method proposed 
by FEMA-273 (1997) is an application of 
this kind of research. 
From the noted researches, it can be 
found that inelastic spectrum approach is one 
of the most commonly used methods for the 
seismic assessments of inelastic systems. 
However, up to now, all kinds of the 
spectrum approach are based on SDOF 
systems. It is based on the fact that the 
equation of motion of an N-DOF structure 
can be decomposed into N-SDOF modal 
equations of motion. However, by 
investigating the relationships of roof 
translation versus base shear and roof 
rotation versus base torque, 2DOF modal 
equations of motion for uni-axial 
plan-asymmetric structures have been 
developed (Lin and Tsai, 2006). And, each 
2DOF modal equation of motion has a 
corresponding 2DOF modal stick with 
translational and rotational DOF. The 2DOF 
modal stick is eventually equivalent to SDOF 
modal stick at elastic state and has the 
non-proportionality and interaction of 
translation versus rotation at inelastic state. 
In this study, the 2DOF modal stick instead 
of conventional SDOF modal stick is applied 
to estimate engineering demands of uni-axial 
asymmetric building systems under the 
ensemble of ten seismic ground motions. The 
engineering demands include the maximum 
relative displacement, velocity, the maximum 
absolute acceleration and the residual 
displacement. From the statistical results, a 
functional model to estimate inelastic 
displacement ratio, CR, in terms of the period 
of vibration, T, and the lateral strength ratio, 
R, is established. Moreover, a modifying 
factor for the coefficient C1 of the coefficient 
method (FEMA 273, 1997) is recommended 
for uni-axial asymmetric building systems.  
 
Parametric Study 
 
The equation of motion for the 2DOF 
stick shown in Figure 1 is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By investigating the above equation, it can be 
found that there are actually only two 
independent elastic parameters, i.e. the 
period of vibration, T, and the eccentricity, e. 
The physical meaning of the eccentricity, e, 
is the ratio of the rotational-caused 
translational displacement and the total 
translational displacement at center of mass 
for the 2DOF stick. 
For the 2DOF sticks, not only 
translational responses but also rotational 
responses can be obtained. Consequently, 
denote the maximum absolute acceleration, 
maximum relative velocity and maximum 
relative displacement of translational and 
rotational responses as Saz, Svz, Sdz, and Saθ, 
Svθ,, Sdθ, respectively. The latter are 
fundamental requisites to obtain the corner 
responses of asymmetric structures by 
inelastic spectrum approach. The 
translational and rotational strength ratio, Rz 
and Rθ, for 2DOF sticks can be written as 
 
 
 
 
 
in which Fyz and Fyθ　are the yielding lateral 
strength and the yielding rotational strength, 
respectively. The translational and rotational
