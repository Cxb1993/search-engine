Abstract This study self-develops a novel type of optical thermoelectric power generation
modules, using dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to serve as photoelectric conversion
system and coating nano-Cu heat-transfer film on the two sides of thermoelectric generator
(TEG) to act as thermoelectric conversion system to make the whole of modules absorb light and
generate electricity by DSSCs and recycle waste heat and regenerate power by TEG. Besides, a
set of pulsating heat pipe of filling nano-Cu fluid is equipped with on the cooling side to increase
cooling effects to enhance whole power generation efficiency. For the preparation of
thermoelectric conversion modules, firstly, commercial nano-Cu powder is adopted to fabricate
nano-Cu heat-transfer film by the doctor blade. The nano-Cu heat-transfer film serves as thermal
conductivity of the media of two systems and coated on the TEG to make two systems become
temperature connected to elevate the output of heat flux and energy. And then, improved
submerged arc nanoparticle synthesis system (SANSS) is used to prepare for nano-Cu fluid;
filling pulsating heat pipe serves as the cooling side of TEG to use gas-liquid phase change to
achieve cooling effects. For the preparation of photoelectric conversion modules, self-made
multi-layer TiO2 nano-film is employed to act as photoanodes to be applied to DSSCs and
combined two systems to form photothermoelectric modules. Finally, I-V measuring system and
temperature measurement device are used to test the output of module performance and
conversion efficiency and electrical storage time of modules is tested as well. Results show that
when the heat source of thermoelectric modules reaches 90oC, 85.6 % power output of original
TEG can be increased. The heat source of modules is heated at 80oC, the electrical storage time
of a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery (1.25V) is around 300 minutes. When
photothermoelectric modules is shined by simulated light, the temperature difference of two
sides of TEG can reach 7oC, thermoelectric conversion efficiency, 2.17% and 11.48 mW/cm2
power output can be produced, enhancing 1.4 % compared to merely using DSSCs.

4was coated on the copper substrate evenly by
coating stick by doctor blade and dried at the
room temperature for 30 minutes. Finally, it
was put in the sintering furnace for at 200℃
for one hour to fabricate nano-Cu
heat-transfer film.
2.2. Preparation of pulsating heat pipe
This experiment was divided into two parts.
The first part used SANSS 13-14) to fabricate
nano-Cu operating fluid. With good thermal
conductivity 15), even distribution of fluid and
better suspension, nano-Cu materials can
serve as the operating fluid of PHP pipe.
Figure 1 shows the parameter of SANSS
preparation fluid. The second part is the
preparation of heat pipe hardware. This study
adopts capillary brass with the external
diameter of 3mm and the internal diameter of
2mm as heat pipe materials. Modular design
is designed in accordance with the required 6
pipes and then, T-type three-way valve is
connected to form a closed loop type to be
connected to a valve as the use of open and
closed. Before filling fluid, copper tube was
cleaned action for the first use of alcohol in
sufficient quantities of the way into the brass
tube as the first stage of cleaning. In the
second phase, it was vibrated by ultrasonic
vibration machine for 30 minutes, to remove
impurities from internal and external walls.
Finally, oven was used to dye the residual
liquid in the heat pipe. And then, vacuum
pumping system was adopted to fabricate
low-pressure environment of pipe and
atmosphere was reduced unto 10-3mpa.
Finally, a syringe was used to inject into CuO
nanofluid. This study executes two stages of
exhausting and filling and thus, before filling
with hot melt adhesive to avoid leakage.
2.3 Preparation of photothermoelectric
modules
To integrate with DSSCs and thermoelectric
modules, both of their exterior were imposed
pressure to make them tight fit to be
temperature connected, shown in Figure 1.
The uppermost –DSSCs, primarily absorb
solar energy into electrical energy, a
continuous heat source for this experiment
and its waste heat can be recycled to be
converted into electricity by thermoelectric
chips. DSSCs were adhered a copper
heat-transfer nanofilm as the medium of TEG.
The cold end of TEG was also attached a
copper heat-transfer nanofilm and the main
purpose is to enhance heat conduction of
modules. Finally, heat pipes were placed in
the bottom of PHP to accelerate the cooling of
the cold side of TEG. This study uses internal
materials of TEG –Bi2Te3, and two sides –
ceramic substrates.
2.4 Output experiment of
photothermoelectric modules
The experimental output tests consist of
waste heat simulates experiment (heat
generated by DSSCs) and simulated light
experiment. Keithley 2400 multi-function
power meter was used to measure voltage,
current output of modules, with heating
platform respectively, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90℃
to test waste heat generated by DSSCs shown
in Figure 2. Simulated light experiment used
the actual illumination with DSSCs standard
light source (100 W/cm2) to carry out light
and employed Yokogawa MV200 temperature
recorders to measure the surface of DSSCs,
the film surface of TEG hot end and cold side
and other parts of the temperature. Whole
discussion is shown in Figure 3.
3. Experimental results and Discussion
3.1 Electron microscope
FE-SEM is used to observe of copper
heat-transfer nanofilm. Figure 4 shows the
appearance after sintering and surface after
being sintered is more clear and simple. As
the Law scraper slurry blending nano-copper
salts and water infiltration between the pores,
sintering of these salts and water evaporation,
thus slightly porous films. Figure 5 shows the
morphology of nanoparticles of copper to
FE-SEM observation of nano copper particles
under the business round appearance, particle
size of about 30nm. Figure 6. To observe the
nano copper film section map, owned by the
paterns that the film thickness of about 40μm. 
By the Zetasizer Nano particle size analyzer
for analysis of fluid particles in the
6thermoelectric modules, when the
thermoelectric module cold side temperature
stability is about about 7 ℃, the output
current and voltage will be stable, the output
value was about 13.15 mA and 112 mV.
Table 2 shows DSSCs, TEG thermoelectric
module photovoltaic module and the output
table. By the form can be found, DSSCs
photoelectric conversion efficiency of
photovoltaic modules to 7.07%, while TEG
thermoelectric conversion efficiency of
thermoelectric modules was 2.17%, while the
DSSCs photovoltaic module power output
11.32 mW/cm2, while the TEG thermoelectric
module's power output is 0.163 mW/cm2.
Overall, the output of thermoelectric modules
significantly lower than the photovoltaic
modules to the main reason for the DSSCs
optical module is the direct solar energy into
electrical energy, while the TEG
thermoelectric power generation module is to
DSSCs produced after thermal energy for
converting the electrical energy, can be
regarded as secondary recycling of energy
generation, and the experiment with TEG
thermoelectric modules do not require
additional power output of the device, so the
temperature will be lower, so less output
caused by thermoelectric modules of it; while
this experiment does not consume extra power,
and the use of an endless supply of light
energy and waste heat to generate electricity
is also the main purpose in this study. Control
power output point of view, this study design
their own planning thermoelectric module in a
simulated light source to DSSCs surface
temperature of 65 ℃, can produce a total of
11.48 mW/cm2 of power output, than simply
using the dye-sensitized solar cells increased
by about 1.4% of the power output. The
results of this relatively low compared with
the literature, the reason for the use of light as
energy source and conversion of light energy
through the DSSCs occurs after the waste heat
to second generation, so results were low, but
get rid of DSSCs therefore lead excess heat,
and use of waste heat in the case, this result is
acceptable.
4. Conclusions
Through the above experimental results
and discussion, it can be obtained by the
following conclusions:
Results of this study showed that improved
thermoelectric module of hot side temperature
of 90 ℃ 20.8mA current when the voltage
output of 199mV output, respectively, than
the simple use of TEG by approximately
54.1% and 20.6% of current output and
voltage output. Conversion success rate of the
output value of 4.14mW, the chip is improved
about 85.7% of the original thermal power
output. Light designed thermoelectric
generator, in a simulated light irradiation
intensity of 100 mW/cm2, the total power
output of 11.48 mW/cm2, while the
thermoelectric conversion efficiency of
thermoelectric modules was 2.17%. The
modules use solar cells produced by waste
heat recovery, than simply using the solar cell
to enhance the power output of about 1.4%.

biosynthesis. Especially the superparamagnetic nanoparticles combined with the adsorption theory
has been applied to medical treatment, cell separation, and the purification of proteins and genomes.
Some achievements have been made in this regard. 1-4)
FePt has been regarded as a permanent magnetic materials because it can produce a highly
coercive field for a long period of time. 5) Superparamagnetic fluctuation of room-temperature
magnetization can thus be suppressed even for particles with diameters ranging from 2.7–3.0 nm. 6)
FePt nanoparticles fabricated by chemical synthesis methods are low in cost and easy to control. An
American researcher, Bhargava reported the luminescence of ZnS nano phosphor in an international
conference of luminescence in 1994. The most conspicuous characteristic of ZnS nano phosphor is
the difference in its absorption and reflection of light; furthermore, it allows the color of ZnS to
change its size to correspond with the emission wavelength. 7) For purification in bio-separation,
magnetic separation technology is speedy, easy to recover (in the magnetic field) and easy to control
compared to traditional approaches. These functional magnetic particles are composed of two parts:
the core of the magnetic particles and the shell covering the exterior of core. The structure of the
shell offers compatibility, proper distribution of particles and sufficient functional bases such as
selective absorption and surface modification. With the combination between metal, ceramics, high
polymers or biochemical molecules, the core-shell structures of nanoparticles aim to regulate the
surface properties, fabricate hollow spherical shell material or create multifunctional composites. 8)
Aslam et al. used SiO2 to cover FePt to the form of core-shell structure in 2005. 9) Marco Zanella
team proposed different methods to cover FePt by different materials in 2008. 10) Conjugation is that
we adopt positive and negative charge to connect nanoparticles with core-shell structure with DNA.
UV-vis is used to measure absorption spectra and measured absorption value and original
absorption value are compared to obtain conjugation efficiency. Hybridization is that we conjugate
two groups of premier DNA with nanoparticles with core-shell structure. Moreover, a group of
primer is connected two groups of different primer DNA of compensated bridge DNA with two
groups of conjugated DNA.
In this study, the fluorescent material zinc sulfide is adopted to modify the surface of
magnetic nanoparticles to form the nanocore-shell composite particles. Then, a piece of DNA
primer is conjugated with the nanocore-shell composite particles to form magnetic and optical
properties to fabricate a biotype probe with magneto-optical conductivity, increasing the availability
of the magnetic nanoparticles. 11) A transmission electron microscope (TEM) is employed to
observe the morphology of the fabricated photomagnetic nanocore-shell structure and energy
dispersive spectrometer (EDS) X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) to analyze its ingredients. And
then, UV-vis is used to analyze the conjugation efficiency of nanoparticles with core-shell structure
conjugated with DNA and acid orange 7 (AO7) indicator is used to test the reaction of hybridization.
Finally, fluorescence spectrometer is used to analyze its luminescence.
2. Experimental
First of all, 19.51mg of Pt(acac)2 and 16.76mg of Fe(acac)3 were drawn as reaction precursors.
11.63mg of 1, 2-hexadecanediol and 3ml of ether were added, and finally put in the three-neck flask.
The three-neck flask was heated to 100 and the temperature was maintained for 20 minutes.℃
wavelength OD485 was lowered and the hybridization solution was proven to contain DNA
molecules. For the UV-vis inspection, the reaction of strands DNA makes the absorbance lower and
hence, the absorbance of single DNA is higher than that of strands DNA. The occurrence of
hybridization was confirmed. Finally, fluorescence spectrometer was used to inspect the
luminescence for FePt nanoparticles, FePt/ZnS nanoparticles with core-shell structure and the
hybridization of FePt nanoparticles and FePt/ZnS nanoparticles respectively.
3. Results and discussion
TEM was employed to measure the shapes and sizes of FePt nanoparticles and FePt/ZnS
nanoparticles with core-shell structure. Fig.1 reveals that the average size of FePt nanoparticles is
2-3nm. Fig.2 shows that the average size of FePt/ZnS nanoparticles with core-shell structure is
7-13nm. We can see that ZnS covered FePt nanoparticles to form core-shell structure and the shell
thickness is around 5-10nm.
EDS was used to analyze local elements of FePt nanoparticles and FePt/ZnS nanoparticles
with core-shell structure. Fig.3 shows that nano-powder consists of Fe and Pt elements and Fig.4
shows that nano-powder consists of Fe, Pt and Zn elements.
FePt nanoparticles and FePt/ZnS nanoparticles with core-shell structure were adopted for
powder diffraction analysis by XRD and compared with standard spectrums. Fig.5 shows that FePt
peak occurs in 23.8 and 40.6 of 2 Theta. Fig.6 shows that in addition to the occurrence of PePt peak,
ZnS peak also occurs in the 28.9 and 48.1 of 2 Theta.
Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was used to execute the magnetic
detection of FePt nanoparticles and FePt/ZnS core-shell nanoparticles at the room temperature. The
applied magnetic field of FePt nanoparticles and FePt/ZnS core-shell nanoparticles is from -20000
Oe to 20000 Oe. Fig.7 shows that saturation magnetic susceptibility of FePt is 1.678emu/g and the
saturation magnetic susceptibility is reduced to 0.975emu/g when FePt covered with ZnS. Results
show that magnetic properties of FePt will slightly lower when FePt covered with ZnS. Besides, the
coercivity of FePt is 13.299 Oe and FePt/ZnS, 7.388 Oe; both of them are soft magnetic fluids and
display their superparamagnetic condition.
Self-designed 3 kinds of DNA premiers are listed in Table 1. After the 4OD D1DNA, 5.3OD
D2DNA and FePt/ZnS nanofluid with core-shell structure reacted sufficiently, a UV-vis
spectrometer was utilized to measure the absorption spectrum. Fig.8 demonstrates that for the
wavelength of 260nm, the absorbance of 4OD DNA can reach 3.2OD, with 80% efficiency.
Moreover, the absorbance of 5.3OD DNA can reach 3.4OD, with 64% efficiency. Finally, bridge
DNA (BDNA) and the two groups of DNA in different sequences done with conjugation were
conjugated. Fig.9 reveals that AO7 with a wavelength of 485nm produces specific absorbance peak
of 3.2 for D1DNA and 3.4 for D2DNA. The absorbance peak of 3.0 for OD260 is lower than the
former two. Thus, hybridization does occur between D1DNA and D2DNA.
AO7 indicator was added to the TE buffer and a UV-vis spectrometer was employed to
measure the absorption spectrum of AO7 and AO7 which will produce specific absorption in the
wavelength of 485nm. Hybridized fluid was added into AO7 indicator with the same concentration
to react for 10 minutes. Fig.10 shows that absorption will descend significantly in the 485nm and

Abstract
In this study, we adopt two different morphologies of self-made nano-TiO2 powder to prepare a
double-layer photoelectrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Further, DSSC module and
thermoelectric generator (TEG) coated with nano-Cu thin film were integrated with a novel
photo-thermoelectric generator. For the fabrication of photoelectric conversion modules, TiO2
nanoparticles (H200) fabricated by the hydrothermal method and the powder of TiO2 nanofluid
prepared by the submerged arc nanofluid synthesis system (SANSS) were utilized to prepare a
double-layer thin film using a surgical blade as the photoelectrode of DSSCs. And then, commercial
nano-Cu powder was coated on two sides of TEG to fabricate thermoelectric conversion module by
surgical blade. Nano-Cu thin film, as the medium of thermal conductivity, can effectively transfer
heat produced by sunlight on the surface of DSSC to the two sides of TEG. Finally, the two modules
were combined into the optical thermoelectric generator. The overall experiment utilizes the
intensity of 100 mW/cm2 illumination of simulated sunlight, which can produce 4.97 mW/cm2, an
increase of 2.87% output compared with merely employing the DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Energy technology is one of the most important technologies. In the 21st century, technology has
dominated people’s life and people’s consumption for energy will drastically soar. Moreover,
environmental pollution has increasingly become a worldwide concern in the past few decades.
Thus, how to enhance the efficiency of natural energy use and to recycle regenerated energy has
become an important research field for developed countries. Countries such as America, Japan, and
many European countries have gradually increased their recycling of waste heat. Therefore,
utilizing heat energy to generate electricity is more and more significant. 1)
After DSSCs were illuminated by sunlight, the dye molecules adsorbing on the surface of TiO2
naoparticles inside the DSSCs will ignite excited electrodes after absorbing incident light of specific
wavelength. Afterwards, electrodes will have reduction reaction with electrolyte in counter
was attached, so the nanoparticles could be evenly stirred by the vortex during collection. The
prepared nanofluid was allowed to settle for two weeks, and then TiO2 nanoparticles were drawn
out from the TiO2 nanofluid. These TiO2 nanoparticles taken out from the TiO2 nanofluid are here
referred to as SANSS fluid (SF). The preparation process for titania nanotubes (Tnt) is that 20 g of
sodium hydroxide was put in the perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) and 50 ml of deionized water was added to
prepare a 10M NaOH solution. Then, 1.5 g of Degussa P25 TiO2 powder was added into 10 M of
sodium hydroxide solution. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and then
placed in an autoclave. After the autoclave was placed in an oven at 130 oC with this mixed
solution for 24 hrs to complete the reaction, it was removed and allowed to cool to room
temperature. Then, the white sediment inside the autoclave was drawn out and added to 500 ml of
deionized water and the fluid was stirred and dispersed. After filtration, it was washed repeatedly
with 0.1 M of HNO3 to reach a pH value of 1.5. Finally, the sediments acquired from the repeated
washing were placed in an oven at 80 oC for drying, thus yielding Tnt.13-14) The prepared Tnts were
added into 0.1 M of HNO3. The solution was placed in an oven at 200 oC for 12 h of hydrothermal
treatment, and then put in a centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 30 min. The white sediment was drawn out
and then dried in an oven at 80 oC until TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained. Nanoparticles acquired
after the hydrothermal treatment at 200 oC are hereafter referred to as H200.
2.2 Fabrication of double-layer photoelectrode
First, 0.1 g samples of H200 and SF were individually added to 0.67 ml of deionized water. After
the fluid had been intensely stirred for 60 min and undergone ultrasonic vibration for 30 min, it had
0.03 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW = 20000) added and blended to a white paste. The paste
was spread evenly on the conductive glass, FTO, using a surgical blade. After the FTO was dried at
room temperature for 30 min, it was put in a sintering oven at a constant temperature of 450 oC for
30 minutes. The sintered photoanode was soaked in 0.2 M of TiCl4 mixed with ethanol. After the
fluid was placed in an oven at 70 oC for 30 min, the photoanode was sintered at 450 oC to acquire a
thin photoanode film. Finally, the photoelectrode with the completed TiO2 thin film was cut into
pieces of 0.25 cm2 and then soaked in the N719 dye and ethanol. After soaking for 24 h, the dye
was completely adsorbed on the surface of the photoelectrode to form a TiO2 photoelectrode with a
double-layer structure (H200 and SF). In this study, electrolyte was fabricated by 0.1 M of LiI, 0.5
M of I2, and 0.5 M of tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and solvent was acetonitrile (ACN). The counter
electrode, Pt was coated on the conductive glass FTO by sputtering.
2.3 Fabrication of nano Cu thermoelectric thin film
First, 0.5 g commercial nano-Cu powder was poured into the mortar, and 0.05 ml acetylacetone was
also added to the mortar. Then, 0.9 ml deionized water was added to grind the mixed solution and
0.25 ml Triton X-100 was also added three times. After that, the mixed solution was evenly ground
to a black paste. The black paste was evenly applied to the copper substrate using a surgical blade
and pasted to adhesive tape to be dried at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, it was placed in
a sintering furnace set at 200 ℃ for 1 hr to fabricate the nano-Cu thermoelectric thin film.
the surface of the nano-Cu thermoelectric thin film is irregular owing to the proportion of the
preparation of the paste, which can greatly affect the viscosity and porosity of the paste. In addition,
the speed and time of grinding will affect the size and consistency of particles. Figure 6 shows the
32.5-μm-thick nano-Cu thermoelectric thin film, which was attached to three layers of scotch tape.
Figures 7-9 show the output of current, voltage, and power from the original TEG and
thermoelectric modules attached to the nano-Cu thermoelectric thin film. It can be seen that the
thermoelectric modules attached to the nano-Cu thermoelectric thin film can have better output than
the original TEG. With increasing temperature of the heat source, the output is much better. When
the heat source reaches 90 ℃, the original TEG output is approximately 22 mA, 170.5 mV, and 3.15
mW. At this temperature, the thermoelectric modules attached to the nano-Cu thermoelectric thin
film produce approximately 24 mA, 181.5 mv, and 3.52 mW, an increased output of about 8.3% for
current, 6.06% for voltage, and 11.8% for power.
Results show that this study integrates DSSC and TEG coated with nano-Cu thin film to
fabricate a novel photo-thermoelectric generator. Photo-thermoelectric generator, can not only
convert sunlight into energy, but also adopt heat energy (waste heat) produced by sunlight to
transform into energy. Thus, whole photoelectric conversion efficiency was elevated. Figure 10
shows the temperature of the optical thermoelectric generator measured under the simulated
sunlight. Results demonstrate that the superficial temperature of the DSSCs in the steady state is
about 65 ℃, the hot side of thermoelectric chip is 61.8 ℃, the cold side is 55 ℃, and the
temperature difference of the steady state is about 6.8 ℃. The data for the output of the DSSCs
and thermoelectric modules of the optical thermoelectric modules under simulated sunlight are
shown in Table I.
4. Conclusions
The results and discussion above indicate the following conclusions. The self-developed optical
thermoelectric generator under the intensity of 100 mW/cm2 illumination of simulated sunlight had
a DSSC photoelectric conversion efficiency of 4.83% for DSSCs, and power output of 4.83
mW/cm2. The thermoelectric conversion efficiency of the thermoelectric modules is 1.53%, much
lower than that in the literature because after DSSCs convert light into electricity, the waste heat
will undergo thermoelectric conversion again. Therefore, the temperature of the hot side is not high
and its power output is 0.139 mW/cm2. The optical thermoelectric modules utilize the waste heat
produced by DSSCs to regenerate electricity. The overall output is 4.97 mW/cm2, an increase of
2.87% output over the DSSCs alone.
