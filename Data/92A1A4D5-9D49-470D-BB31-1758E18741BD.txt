1.2 Literature Survey 
 
Due to the effect of underwater explosion were estimated, every country keeps the data 
in secret. Underwater explosion references that public haven’t a lot. In the past references, the 
relative experimental data and finite element method were applied to study the underwater 
explosion. Generally, the relative references of underwater explosion are divided into two 
sections: (1) The physical phenomena of underwater explosion. (2) The water barrier of 
underwater explosion. They are: 
 
1.2.1 The Physical Phenomena of Underwater Explosion 
 
The physical phenomena of underwater explosion are complex. The following relative 
researches were about the shock wave, bubble period, pressure wave and reflection 
wave…etc. 
Keil (1961) [2] described the various phase of an underwater explosion for the 
characteristic shock wave parameters, bubble pulsations. Chisum and shin (1997) [3] studied 
the explosion gas bubbles near simple boundaries using finite element method.  The results 
serve to characterize the behavior of the bubbles for the charge type, charge weight, and 
hydrostatic pressure used in the analyses. Menon and Lal (1998) [4] studied the dynamic and 
instability of bubbles formed during underwater detonations experimentally by exploding 
fuel-oxygen mixture in a laboratory water tank. Various possible mechanisms for the 
dissipation of bubble energy ate addressed. The analysis of the experimental data gives 
quantitative evidence that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is excited near the bubble minimum. 
Murata et. al. (1999) [5] developed a pressure sensor using fluoropolymer as the sensing 
element to precisely measure underwater shock wave and bubble pulse. The experimental 
results show that the peak pressure of bubble pulse is about 15~30% of the peak pressure of 
the shock wave, but the impulse of bubble pulse is about 1.5~2.5 times bigger than that of 
shock wave, within the measured scaled distance range. Kira(1999) [6] used high speed 
photography and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method to clarify the behavior of 
the underwater shock wave close to the spherical high explosives. Liu et. al. (2003) [7] [8] 
applied the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate the high explosive (HE) 
explosion which consists of detonation and dispersion process. The validity of SPH in 
simulating HE explosions is tested by modeling the pure detonation process, pure dispersion 
process, on both of them. Some modification in numerical aspects such as the evolution of the 
smoothing length, treatment of solid boundaries and material interfaces are made to suit the 
needs of underwater explosion problems. Wang et. al. (2003) [9] proposed an elastic mesh 
technique (EMT) and employed in conjunction with the boundary integral method (BIM) for 
the simulation of three–dimension underwater explosion bubble dynamics in which problems 
relating to serve mesh distortion as the bubble evolves are a common occurrence. Rungsiya 
Phornrat(2003) [10] investigated two gaseous bubble merging into a single coalesced bubble 
 - 4 -
sequential underwater detonation of discrete line charges that consisted of five to eight 
10-pounds charges separated by 8 feet and fabricated from C-4 demolition blocks. There is no 
positive evidence that jet heights are different when shallow explosions take place in deep 
water. Charles et al. (1998) [18] used two measurement techniques, including microwave 
absorption and electrical conductivity, were employed to determine the amount and density of 
water in the barrier plume cross section by the underwater detonation of continuous and 
discrete line charges in series of test shots. William et al. (1998) [19] used mathematical 
model and computation code to validate and predict the behavior of shallow-depth explosion 
plume. C.C. Liang et. al.(2006) [20] used the finite element software MSC.Dytran to analyze 
the profile of the water barrier caused by underwater explosion. A TNT charge of 9.1kg was 
set at different depths underwater, and the numerical analysis of water barrier produced by 
underwater explosion was investigated. The results were compared with the results obtained 
by the semi-empirical method presented by Michael.  Then, the history of the water barrier 
caused by three TNT charges of different weights (10kg, 20kg, 30kg) were analyzed. 
Also in this study, numerical studies of explosion plume which includes contours of the 
plume (plume height, plume width and plume thickness) and duration decreasing for charges 
fired at different depth are investigated in details and compared with Michael’s empirical 
methodology. The studies presented in this paper attempt to supply a reasonable 
comprehensive account, which will be used for workers in the field of underwater explosion. 
 
1.3 Purpose 
 
This project is a study of the water barrier of underwater explosion. In this study, the 
high non-linear finite element software MSC.Dytran was used to simulate the water barrier of 
underwater explosion. In this study, the best conditions for a water barrier and how to obtain 
the best protection were investigated. Due to the protection ability would be influenced by the 
shape, width and height of water barrier. Therefore, it is expected to obtain reliable data by 
using two dimensional and three dimensional models for underwater explosion to build the 
simulative scene. With finite element analysis software, low-cost numerical analysis with 
high reliability can be implemented to analyze plume height and density in underwater line 
charges explosion. The data obtained from the simulation are similar to actual situation by 
computer and the disadvantage of spending too much money on real tests can be avoided. 
In order to validate and estimate the study of the effect of explosion, the semi-empirical 
method presented by Cole [15] and Michael [16] is used to study the estimation of underwater 
and surface effect of underwater explosion by single charge. Afterwards, the result was 
compared to the test report of the underwater explosion by thirteen line charges done by the 
Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD). The data retrieved from 
camera recording was compared to the data obtained from the numerical simulation. The best 
charge depth of line charges and horizontal distance of charge was investigated to find the 
maximum water splashed into air to resist the attack of anti-ship missile.

Eq.(2.1) describes the conservation of mass, momentum and energy. In Eq.(2.2), ρ  is the 
material density, wvu ,, are the velocity components, p  is the pressure and E  is the total 
energy. For a gas, we can close the system (note that we have 5 equations, with 6 unknowns) 
by adding the equation of state for a caloric perfect gas (it is the “gamma law equation of 
state”): 
ep ⋅⋅−= ργ )1(                                  (2.3) 
In Eq.(2.3), e  denotes the specific internal energy of the gas and γ  is the ratio of specific 
heats. There exist more equations of state for gases, but most gases can be described as caloric 
perfect gases, in which case Eq.(2.3) applies. 
For a fluid in the simplest form, a so-called “simple bulk” equation of state is used;

In Eq.(2.4), K  is the material bulk modulus and 0ρ   is the reference density at which the 
material has no pressure. Also for fluids there are more equations of state, like a full 
polynomial or Tait’s equation of state. Both are implemented in the approximate Riemann 
solver that MSC.Dytran uses, but the method of implementation is similar to the simple 
equation of state. 
 
2.2 Equation of State 
 
The equation of state for a material is of the basic form 
Pressure = f(density, specific internal energy)                   (2.5)

2.3 Ignition and Growth Explosive Material Model  
 
The IG (Ignition and Growth) model governs the simulation of the reaction zone of 
explosive material where the transition from the fully reacted state occurs. Prior to the start of 
the reaction, its “un-reacted” EOS (described by Eq.2.9 below) models the explosive. After 
the reaction has completed, the explosive is modeled by the JWL equation of state for the 
detonation product. The reaction rate relation controls the fraction of explosive reaction per 
cycle during the transition from the un-reacted to the reacted state. 
(1) IG Model： 
The JWL (Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation) of state is used in the ignition and growth 
calculations for both the un-reacted and the reaction products

The total volume V is known from the deformed shape of the element. 
 
8. Variables in a mixture element 
The behavior of the ignition and growth detonation model in the mixed phase is 
described by the above 8 equations (eq(2.9) to eq(2.16)).  The following variables in a 
mixture element are solved for at the end of each time step： 
( )11111111 ,,,,,,, ++++++++ ipieipieipieipie mmEEPP ηη  
For a known fraction of reacted explosive F in a time step, these variables are solved by 
iteration on volumetric changes until a pressure equilibrium ( )pe PP ≅ in the element is 
reached. 
During the iteration process, the pressure difference is used as a convergence parameter 
to check for a converged solution. Each iteration adjusts the volume of un-reacted and 
reaction products in the mixed element. When a converged solution is obtained, a final 
check is performed to verify the assumption that the volumes of the mixture elements 
be additive:

From Eq.(2.21) it becomes apparent that the fluxes of mass, momentum and energy have 
to be integrated normal to the boundary of the volume, or, its surface. When we use the 
rotational invariance of the Euler equations of motion, the integral form can be rewritten 
using the transformation matrix that describes the transformation of the state variables in 
direction normal to the surface：

Where q~  denotes the state vector, transformed to a coordinate system with the local 
x-axis in the direction of the normal to the surface. When we then make the step to a 
discredited form, by defining the volume as the volume of a finite element (an element of 
the Euler mesh,) and the surface defined by the faces spanning the element, Eq.(2.22) 
becomes a local one-dimensional system of equations for each face of the element with the 
local x-axis in the direction of the normal to the element’s face. 
The system of equations to solve for each element face thus becomes:

∂+∂

qf
t
q                        (2.23) 
Where x~  defines the x-direction normal to the element’s face. Considering the fact that 
each face has a left and a right element connected to it, we can view the state variables in 
the left- and right connected element as initial conditions for the solution of the flux 
normal to the face:

                      (2.24) 
Eqs.(2.23) and (2.24) describe a so-called Riemann problem. Thus, the solution for the 
fluxes at the element faces amounts to solving a local 1D Riemann problem for each of the 
faces of the element, considering the left and right state of the fluid or the gas. The 
contribution of the face fluxes result in the state change in the element as a function of 
time as denoted by the first term in Eq.(2.23). The fluxes on the faces are determined using 
a flux function, ( )RLR qqf ,  by which, using Eqs. (2.22), (2.23) and (2.24), the 
discretization becomes:

The above described flux evaluation scheme is called an approximate Riemann scheme 
due to the fact a linearization using the weighted quantities at the element faces is applied. 
(3) Entropy fix for the flux difference Riemann scheme 
The approximate Riemann scheme exhibits an artifact, namely that it does not satisfy 
the entropy inequality. The entropy inequality states that the entropy of a system can only 
remain constant or increate. Due to the artifact, the scheme is able to also capture 
mathematically sound, but physically impossible discontinuities like expansion shocks. A 
so-called entropy fix must be added to the scheme in order to expansion fan.  The entropy 
fix in fact amounts to adding some numerical viscosity or dissipation to sonic points, 
shocks and contact discontinuities. The dissipation is added only at those points where any 
one of the system’s eigenvalues vanishes. 
The entropy fix can be written in terms of a simple function:

The function works automatically on the eigenvalues of the system, represented in eqn (34) 
by z , and is governed by a single parameter 1δ  that depends on the flow field:

(4) Second order accuracy of Riemann scheme 
The flux function as given in general by eq 2.(29), it dose not say anything about the 
order of accuracy at which the face fluxes are computed. The accuracy is governed by the 
way in which the left and the right state variables are determined. 
A so-called nonlinear limiter that avoids the creation of new minimum or maximum 
values limits the second order left- and right face values of the state variables. Such a 
scheme is called total variation diminishing, or TVD. Near sharp discontinuities the 
scheme reverts to locally first order as to introduce the necessary numerical viscosity to 
avoid oscillations in the solution near the discontinuity.  
The second order approximate Riemann solver in MSC.Dytran applies the superbee 
limiter. The 2nd order scheme can be formally written as:

to the Eulerian mesh. The mass, momentum, and energy of the material is transported 
from element to element depending on the direction and velocity of the material flow. 
MSC.Dytran then calculates the impulse and work done on each of the faces of every 
Eulerian element. Eulerian elements can only be solid but have a general connectivity. 
One type of Euler elements, a six-sided CHEXA with eight grid points (Fig.2.3) defining 
the corners is adopted in the analysis. The connectivity of the element is defined in exactly 
the same manner as a Lagrangian element. 
 
(7) Time Step 
Based on the element-by element estimate, the stability limit can be redefined using 
the element length, eL , and the wave speed of the material, dc : 
d
e
stable C
L
t =Δ                          (2.43) 
For most element types-a distorted quadrilateral element, for the above equation is only an 
estimate of the actual element-by-element stability limit because it is not clear how the 
element length should be determined. As an approximation the shortest element distance 
can be used, but the resulting estimate is not always conservative. The shorter the element 
length is, the smaller the stability limit is. The wave speed is a property of the material: 
ρ
Ecd =                            (2.44) 
Where E is Young’s modulus and ρ  is the mass density. The stiffer the material, and the

explosive was modeled by a JWL equation of state in MSC.Dytran. We assumed the 
explosive was a ball, and the radius of the ball was 0.04 m. 
The seawater was modeled using a polynomial equation of state. This state equation 
accounts for changes in the pressure of the seawater due to density change and specific 
internal changes. The density of water is 1000 kg/m3. The bulk modulus is taken as 2.2E9 Pa. 
Water hydrostatic pressure is defined starting from 1.0E5 Pa at the surface and increasing 
going down. A minimum pressure of zero was defined for the seawater, so that if at any time 
during the transient analyses the flow was such as to give a portion of the seawater a negative 
total pressure, all of the seawater would flow out of that region and a void would be created.  
The density of air is 1.1848 kg/m3. The ratio of heat capacities of the gas is constant as 
1.4. Specific internal energy is taken as 2.14E5 kg-m2/s2. Initial air pressure is set to 1.0E5 Pa. 
Gravity load is applied to the whole model. In this simulation, the 8-node and hexahedron 
elements were adopted to construct the real surround fluid-field of underwater explosion.  
Some boundary conditions of underwater explosion could not be defined in MSC.Dytran 
to simulate the real explosion. Therefore, it was expected to do analysis of real test with the 
limited setting of boundary conditions. The boundaries in this simulation were all closed, so 
the effect of shock wave on water surface effect was ignored.  Hence, there were some errors 
in the numerical analysis. 
 
4.2.3 Results and Discussion 
 
As shown in Table 4.1, the surface effect of underwater explosion caused by a TNT 
charge. The height of plume of the numerical simulation by MSC.Dytran was shown in Fig. 
4.4. When t = 0.1~0.2s, the bubble was egg-shaped, and it was expanded to the maximum 
volume, and water jet was risen. When t = 0.3s, the contraction of bubble was begun, and the 
water jet was more obviously to observe, and the dense plume was remained until 0.6s. After t 
= 0.6s, the plume began to collapse, and the height of plume at this time was 19.2m. The 
radius of plume which was easier to observe was within 0.1~0.4sec, and the radius of plume 
measured at 0.4s was 10m. At this time, the rising of dome on the water surface could be seen, 
and the structure was complete. After 0.4s, the surrounding of plume was full of water spray. 
Therefore, it was difficult to define the range of the radius of plume while measuring it.

be pointed out. Besides, the measuring range of plume defined by Michael is not clear, so in 
this study, the measuring was based on the plume structure which is more complete.

5. NUMERICAL STUDY OF WATER BARRIER 
 
In this chapter, 2-D model of continuous line charge and 3-D model of discrete line 
charge were used to do the numerical analysis of the shot6 and shot7 sets in the 13 experiment 
done by Joseph in 1996. The size of water surface and contour generated from the underwater 
explosion of line charge with different distance of charge was investigated. 
 
5.1 Continuous Line Charge for Constant Depth Using 2-D Numerical Model 
 
The results obtained from the numerical analysis by MSC.Dytran was compared and 
validated with the example of underwater explosion of continuous line charges done by 
Joseph in 1996. 
 
5.1.1 Problem Description 
 
The example of underwater explosion of continuous line charges done by Joseph in 
NSWCDD in 1996 was the object of validation. The continuous line charges were illustrated 
in Fig. 5.1. The continuous line charges were consisted of 56 C4 charges, and each one is 1.25 
pounds. The length of line charges is 56ft, and it is located 8.2ft below the water surface to 
explode. 
 
5.1.2 Model Description 
 
The relative position of the explosives, water, air and water-air surface is shown in Fig. 
5.2 The 2-D model was used in the study. The two-dimension (2-D) model uses an initial 
approximation of the bubble as a circular cylinder of infinite extent. The line charge was 
parallel to the Y-axis, and the symmetric plane crossed the center of the line charge and 
parallel to the X-axis. This approximation is reasonable for the discrete tests only if the 
distance between charges is relatively small when compared with the maximum diameter of 
the spherical bubble from an individual charge. Pressure at the outer boundaries is set to the 
hydrostatic pressure. The Euler mesh contains the water, the air-water surface and the air. Fig. 
5.3 shows the 2-D finite element model used for this problem and consists of 250000 
(50m×50m) Eulerian elements and 502002 nodes which contain explosive, water and air. The 
element size for this domain is the same as 0.1 m in this simulation. 
A spherical detonation wave front traveling outward from the initiation point at the 
center of the charge at a velocity of 8193 m/s was used. The explosive C4 is created in this 
Euler mesh, too. The density of the explosive is 1601 kg/m3 and the mass of every charge is 
(1.25 lb) 0.567 kg. The specific internal energy is 6.657E6 kg-m2/s2. The explosive be

5.2.1 Problem Description 
 
The example of underwater explosion of discrete line charges done by Joseph in 
NSWCDD in 1996 was the object of validation. The discrete line charges were illustrated in 
Fig 5.5. The discrete line charges were consisted of 8 C4 charges, and each one is 10 pounds. 
The separation of charges is 8ft, and the total length of the discrete line charge is 56ft. It is 
located 8.2ft below the water surface to explode. 
 
5.2.2 Model Description 
 
(1) 2-D numerical model 
The relative position of the explosives, water, air and water-air surface is shown 
in Fig. 5.6 The line charge was parallel to the X-axis, and the symmetric plane crossed 
every center of the charges and parallel to the X-axis, vertical to the Y-axis. Pressure 
at the outer boundaries is set to the hydrostatic pressure. The Euler mesh contains the 
water, the air-water surface and the air. Fig. 5.7 shows the 2-D finite element model 
used for this problem and consists of 50000 (100m×100m) Eulerian elements and 
100902 nodes which contain explosive, water and air. The length of Eulerian solid 
element in x-direction was meshed by 0.4m, and the length in z-direction was meshed 
by 0.5m. 
A spherical detonation wave front traveling outward from the initiation point at 
the center of the charge at a velocity of 8193 m/s was used. The explosive C4 is 
created in this Euler mesh, too. The density of the explosive is 1601 kg/m3 and the 
mass of every charge is (10 lb) 4.53 kg. The specific internal energy is 6.657E6 
kg-m2/s2. The explosive be modeled by a JWL equation of state in MSC.Dytran. We 
assumed the explosive is a ball, the radius of the ball is 0.088 m. 
The seawater was modeled using a polynomial equation of state. This state 
equation accounts for changes in the pressure of the seawater due to density change 
and specific internal changes. The density of water is 1025 kg/m3. The density of air is 
1.0 kg/m3. The ratio of heat capacities of the gas is constant as 1.4. Specific internal 
energy is taken as 2.5E5 kg-m2/s2. Initial air pressure is set to 1.0E5 Pa. Gravity load 
is applied to the whole model. 
(2) 3-D numerical model 
The relative position of the explosives, water, air and water-air surface is shown 
in Fig. 5.8 The 3D model was the model of whole scene. Pressure at the outer 
boundaries is set to the hydrostatic pressure. The Euler mesh contains the water, the 
air-water surface and the air. Fig. 5.9 shows the 3-D finite element model used for this 
problem and consists of 512000 (32m×32m×40m) Eulerian elements and 531441 
nodes which contain explosive, water and air. The length of Eulerian solid element in x 
 - 42 -
length of water barrier by 3D model was better. By comparing the numerical result of 
diameter of water barrier to the one obtained from the experiment done by Joseph, the value at 
t = 0~0.5s was very close, and the diameter was bigger than the one generated from the 
underwater explosion of continuous line charge (The diameter of water barrier generated from 
the underwater explosion of continuous line charge was similar to a thin jet, and the diameter 
was smaller.)

6. CONCLUSIONS 
 
6.1 Conclusions 
 
The comparison between computational and experimental measurements of height, 
length, diameter, and thickness of plume produced by underwater explosion was presented in 
this study. Of particular interest was the study of line charge configurations, which created a 
plume “barrier” by ejecting a “wall of water” above the surface. Such an effect occurs after 
either the nearly simultaneous detonation of discrete charge placed sufficiently close together 
in a line, or the detonation of a continuous line of charges. In this study, the FEM software 
MSC.Dytran was used to do the numerical simulation of the effect of water surface after 
underwater explosion caused by continuous and discrete line charge, and the results was 
compared to the experiment data presented by Joseph. The important conclusions obtained in 
this project were in the following: 
(1) First, the plume generated from the underwater explosion of single charge was 
compared to the one computed by semi-empirical method presented by Michael. The 
results showed that using the FEM software MSC.Dytran seemed to able to estimate 
the maximum height of plume generated from underwater explosion. 
(2) In the underwater explosion caused by continuous line charge, the numerical result 
obtained from using the 2-D model of underwater explosion was good. The result 
was compared to the experimental data presented by Joseph, and it was observed the 
two results were close. Therefore, it was believed the analyzed result was good. 
(3) In the underwater explosion of discrete line charge, the numerical result obtained 
from the underwater explosion of 2-D model was better than that of 3-D model. The 
size of simulation scene was affected by the number of elements. The reasons were 
in the following: 
(a) The 2-D model was constructed by fewer elements than 3-D model, and the 
simulation scene could be bigger. The distance between the boundary and the 
region of explosion was farther, and the limitation of boundary had less effect on 
the formation of water barrier. 
(b) The 3-D model was constructed by more elements, and the simulation scene was 
smaller. The distance between the boundary and the region of explosion was 
nearer. The compression of air was obvious and became the resistant force 
against the formation of water barrier, and the shock wave would be bounced 
back from the boundary to affect the formation of water barrier. 
(c) From the results of 2-D and 3-D models, it was shown the mesh of element was 
important, and more boundary conditions were needed to solve the problem of 
no backflow of water after explosion.

6.2 Future Works 
 
There are still some problems which can be investigated in the future, and they are 
described in the following: 
(1) Estimation of the optimum depth of underwater explosion of line charge. 
(2) Investigation of optimum distance of charges which can generate better water barrier. 
(3) Discussion of the effect of configuration of charge on the formation of water barrier. 
(4) The optimum length of line charge which can achieve the protection of ship. 
(5) The effect of the distance of line charge and ship on the vessel. 
(6) The timing of detonation of line charge, after the ship detects the missile. 
(7) Uses many line charges by different arrangement way to discover the best line charge 
deployment. 
Underwater explosion tests are conducted to support the development and evaluation of 
water barrier ship-defense concept. The barrier plumes are generated from the single-point 
detonation of C-4 demolition blocks that were configured in continuous and discrete line 
charges. These line charge configurations demonstrated water barrier plume formation using 
single-point detonation. This result indicates that water barrier formation and deployment can 
build on shallow water mine clearance systems that use line charges for a low-cost terminal 
defense. 
It is hoped the research results in this project can be referred to the analysis and design of 
the protection of barrier, the structure and equipments of ship, and the anti-vibration of the 
device in the underwater buildings.

A Study on Torsional Stiffness of the 
Competition Go-kart Frame 
Cho-Chung Liang, Chia-Hua Yu, Chia-Chin Wu 
Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Da-Yeh 
University, 
112 Shan-Jiau Rd, Da-Tsuen, Chang-Hua, Taiwan 51505, R.O.C. 
Abstract 
The construction of the competition Go-kart must satisfy the philosophy of 
extreme simplicity: no redundant part is added to Go-kart, and the Go-kart frame 
is similar to the chassis of a sedan. Accordingly, the design of each part on the 
kart has to contribute to its performance. Due to the absence of differential gear 
and suspension system, the frame must be responsible for offering proper rigidity 
and torsional stiffness to the kart and producing load transfers during cornering.  
Therefore, how to build a good kart frame is very important to Go-kart design.  
In this paper, the torsional stiffness of the Go-kart frame is analyzed in detail by 
using non-linear, explicit dynamic code LS-DYNA 3D. The kart frame presented 
by Solazzi is adopted to be the parent model, and two design concepts are 
investigated to improve the torsional stiffness of the kart frame. The first one is 
the arrangement of extra members at suitable positions on the frame, and nine 
different types of frame are studied. The second one is to increase the width 
between two kingpins, and four different types are studied. The torsional 
stiffness of each frame type is determined and compared with each other. The 
result shows that the torsional stiffness of the frames with larger kingpin width is 
better than those with extra members. In which, the one with width of 828 mm is 
the best type of frame, and the torsional stiffness is 31.03% higher than the 
original. In addition, among the frames with extra members, the one with a right-
inclined member arranged in front of the centre member is the best design, and 
the torsional stiffness is 20.18% higher than the original. It is believed that the 
design concepts presented in this research will provide a useful reference for the 
design and manufacturing of an optimum Go-kart frame.

1 Introduction 
Most of the fans of vehicle racing understand that Go-kart (also called karting) is 
the simplest formula racing in the world, and most of the F1 drivers begin their 
careers from taking part in karting competition. In addition, Go-kart is also a 
popular recreation in the world, because it is suitable for the people of all ages 
and can be divided into several kinds according to different purposes, such as 
processing FEMB (Finite Element Method Builder), solver, and post-processing 
LS-POST.  It is based on the finite element method, and is a three-dimensional 
analysis code, in which all element types and material models are available.  
Lagrangian processor and implicit method are used in this paper.  In FEMB, the 
elements, mesh techniques, materials, and boundary conditions of the frame 
model are defined.   
In this paper, the beam element, as shown in Fig. 3, is selected to build the frame 
model. Each beam element consists of three nodes, and each node has 6 DOFs 
(degrees of freedom), including 3 translational and 3 rotational DOFs. The frame 
model is then divided with line mesh, and the sizes of the elements depend on 
the length of the lines. Several material models are available in LS-DYNA 3D to 
simulate a wide range of linear and non-linear material behaviors. In which, 
elastoplastic material is assigned to the frame model in this paper. The boundary 
conditions should be set to simulate the real analysis of torsional stiffness. The 
translational and rotational DOFs at the two points on both sides of the rear end 
frame are constrained (i.e., Ux = Uy = Uz = 0, θx = θy = θz = 0, at points D and E, 
as shown in Fig. 4).  The horizontal translational and three rotational DOFs at the 
center point (point C in Fig. 4) of the front part of the frame are also constrained 
(i.e., Ux = Uy = 0, θx = θy = θz = 0).  In the simulation of twisting test, the vertical 
displacement (Δy) of the two kingpins is determined by using LS-DYNA 3D. 
4 A Conceptual Design Study of Improving Torsional 
Stiffness on Go-kart Frame 
The dimensions of the kart frame must comply with the regulations of CIK-FIA, 
but even slight modification on the structure of the frame can obviously influence 
the handling performance and the torsional stiffness of a kart. 
       In this paper, the frame model built by Solazzi [2] is taken as the parent 
model and then several types of frame are built and compared to yield the 
optimum design.  Arrangement of extra members at suitable positions on the 
frame as shown in Table 2, and increasing the kingpin width of the frame as 
shown in Table 3 are two design concepts studied in this paper.  Since the Go-
kart frame is an asymmetric structure, the torsional stiffness of the frame will be 
different when the kart is cornering right or left, by implementing the twisting 
test, the vertical force (Fzfo) is applied on the left and the right kingpin, 
respectively.  Furthermore, the vertical force applied on the left kingpin is to 
simulate the kart cornering right, and kart cornering left is by the vertical force 
applied on the right kingpin. 
4.1 Different Frames with Extra Members Arranged 
Table 2 shows ten different types of frame, Model (a) is the original model 
built by Solazzi [2], and others are with extra members arranged (dashed circles).  
The remaining models can be divided into three groups: the first one includes 
models (b) and (c), which are arranged with longitudinal members on the frame; 
the second one includes models (d) and (e), which are arranged with horizontal 
The increment of width from model (k) to model (n) is 50 mm, so the widths 
are 678, 728, 778, and 828 mm, and the weights are 10.55, 10.90, 11.25, and 
11.61 kg, for the four models, respectively.  The torsional stiffness are 7.20%, 
14.82%, 22.76%, and 31.03% and are  7.11%, 14.61%, 22.35%, and 30.45% 
higher than the original model while the force is applied on the left and right 
kingpin, respectively. One can realize the increasing percentage of the torsional 
stiffness is about 7% for each 50-mm increment of the kingpin width. 
4.3 Comparison of Torsional Stiffness of Twisting Test 
Tables 4 and 5 show the results of the twisting test. It is noted that different 
positions of the extra members and different widths affect the torsional stiffness 
and the weight of the kart frame. Some important facts are drawn as follows: 
The torsional stiffness for the nine different types of frame structures with 
extra members are calculated to obtain the best one: 
1. Models (b) and (c) are arranged with longitudinal members, and the torsional 
stiffness of model (b) is higher than that of model (c) no matter which kingpin 
the force is applied. One sees that longitudinal members arranged like model 
(b) can have better result, and it will nearly be the same when the kart is 
cornering right or left. 
2. Models (d) and (e) are arranged with horizontal members, and the torsional 
stiffness of model (e) is higher than that of model (d) no matter which 
kingpin the force is applied.  One can see that arranging horizontal members 
at the middle part of the main frame structure result in higher stiffness than 
those arranging in the front part.  Extra horizontal members can also 
improve handling performance both in cornering right or left. 
3. Models (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j) are arranged with inclined members, and 
Model (g) results in highest torsional stiffness while the force is applied on 
the left kingpin. On the other hand, model (h) will be the one achieving the 
highest stiffness while the force is applied on the right kingpin.  Both model 
(g) and (h) can only improve handling performance in an alternative way of 
the kart cornering right or left. 
4. Among the nine types of frame, model (e) and (g) will achieve the highest 
torsional stiffness while the force is applied on the right and left kingpin, 
respectively. However, model (e) will compromise to have better improvement 
on handling performance in both kart cornering right and left at the same 
time. 
5. It should be noted that the torsional stiffness of the frames with longitudinal 
members or horizontal members added to the frame are independent of the 
force applying on which kingpin. 
6. The torsional stiffness of the frames added with right/left inclined members 
depends upon which kingpin force is applied.  One can know that frames 
arranged with right inclined-members behave better than those arranged 
with left-inclined members while the force is applied on the left kingpin. 
Similarly, the torsional stiffness for each of four different types of frame 
structures with horizontal width increase is also calculated to obtain the best one.  
Among these four frame types, model (n) has the highest torsional stiffness no

ABSTRACT 
A pregnant woman’s body is a very sophisticated dynamic system which is sensitive to 
whole-body vibrations in a sitting posture. While much effort has been devoted to vibration 
effects on non-pregnant seated persons, not much research has been devoted to the 
biodynamic responses of seated pregnant women exposed to vertical vibrations, especially 
in driving conditions. In this study, a thorough survey of lumped-parameter models for 
non-pregnant seated persons is implemented. According to the literature, the six-degree-of-
freedom human model modified from the nonlinear model proposed by Muksian and Nash 
is selected and is further integrated with full-car models to assess the responses of pregnant 
drivers or passengers exposed to vertical vibrations due to road unevenness. It is believed 
that the study presented in this report provides a profound understanding of biodynamic 
responses of seated pregnant women and that it may offer vehicle engineers a good 
reference in the design of vehicle suspension systems. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Dynamic responses of seated human subjects exposed to vibration have attracted a great 
deal of interest over the years. Analytical investigations have been conducted in which the 
human body was treated most frequently as a lumped-parameter (LP) model consisting of 
lumped masses, springs and dashpots. A variety of experiments have also been implemented 
by various researchers under widely varying testing conditions, involving vibration excitations, 
postural constraints, and subject populations. These have, therefore, resulted in significant 
variations between the different data sets generated. In an effort to define generalized values 
for characterizing the biodynamic response of a seated body in the most commonly encountered 
work environments, Boileau et al. [1] identified seat-to-head (STH) transmissibility, driving-
point mechanical (DPM) impedance, and apparent (AP) mass from the existing published data by 
synthesizing and creating envelopes from the various data sets selected. The values of the 
different biodynamic functions were defined for subjects maintaining an erect seated posture 
without backrest support, with their feet resting on a vibrating platform. In addition, a thorough 
study of LP models of seated human subjects without backrest support exposed to vertical 
vibrations was conducted by Liang and Chiang [2]. All models were analyzed systematically 
and validated by a synthesis of various experimental data from the published literature. 
A pregnant woman’s body is a very sophisticated dynamic system consisting of an adult 
body plus a fetus. While much research has been conducted on the effects of vibrations on seated

model to assess the active vibration isolation system. The human model was further validated by 
Liang and Chiang [2] to best fit the existing experimental results; however, since this model does 
not contain an individual mass for the abdomen to encapsulate a fetus, as recommended in 
literature, it probably is not very adequate for representing pregnant bodies 
From the foregoing survey, it is obvious that the LP model is one of the most popular analytical 
methods for the study of biodynamic responses of seated human subjects; however, no study has 
yet focused on the effects of vibrations on pregnant women in driving conditions. Therefore, this 
study is devoted to a thorough survey of the literature on LP models suitable for the analysis of 
biodynamic responses of seated pregnant subjects. In the literature there are four models, linear 
and nonlinear, from suitably selected non-pregnant models in a sitting position. All of them are 
modified to represent seated pregnant subjects, according to the increase in weight during a 9-
month pregnancy. Each model is then analyzed and validated with existing test data. Finally, the 
one best fitted to the test data is integrated with the full-car model by Zuo and Nayfeh [23] to 
assess the biodynamic responses of seated pregnant bodies in driving conditions. 
2 MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF NON-PREGNANT SEATED SUBJECTS 
2.1 Mathematical Models of Non-pregnant Seated Subjects 
From the survey of the literature, the LP models adequate for characterizing pregnant female 
bodies are summarized in Tables 1 to 4. This table is divided into five columns, designated as 
DOFs, researchers, biomechanical parameters (including masses, damping coefficients, and spring 
constants), remarks, and schematic of model, respectively. From this table, one may observe 
that the excitation inputs are mainly from the masses marked “seat” in most models, since the 
human body in a sitting position is considered. However, for the model proposed by Muksian and 
Nash [19] the physical property between the human (pelvis)-seat (rigid) interface was assumed to 
be included in other part of the model. In such a case the human body can be treated as rigidly 
contacting the seat in the analysis; therefore the input is from the mass marked “pelvis” 
(1). Muksian’s model [19] 
From the anatomical description of a human body in a sitting position, a 6-DOF nonlinear 
model with a total mass of 80 kg was formulated. The equations of motion (EOMs) for the 
isolated masses were written for nonlinear springs and dashpots representing the elasticity 
and damping of the human body, respectively. In the system, the spring and damping (hard) 
forces result from relative displacements and velocities and their cubic terms, respectively, 
between two coupled masses, except for the linear neck and back springs (k6 and k7) and 
dampers (c6 and c7). Also included in the model were Coulomb friction forces (F5 and F6) for 
modeling the sliding surfaces between the back and torso, related muscle contractions, and 
ballistocardiographic and diaphragm muscle forces (F3 and F4). As previously mentioned, 
the pelvic stiffness and the damping were assumed to be included in the back; hence, the 
input excitation of the seat was effectively diverted from the pelvis. With all motions restricted 
in vertical direction, the seat (pelvis)-to-head transmissibility was in good agreement with 
individual test results from literature. The schematic and biomechanical parameters of the 
model are listed in Table 1 and Figure 1(a). However, the internal forces can be disregarded, 
as recommended by Liang and Chiang [2], without much influence on the simulation results, 
and as can also be observed in the model created by Patil et al. [16-18]. Therefore, a 
modified Muksian’s model with no internal forces will be employed in this analysis. 
(2). Patil’s model [16-18] 
Based on Muksian’s model, a 7-DOF nonlinear model was developed with all internal 
forces neglected. In addition, a set of spring (k1) and damper (c1), which was purported to 
be included in k6 and c6 in Muksian’s model, was added between the pelvis and the seat, 
the total mass of which is also 80 kg. This model was further incorporated into a tractor 
model to study the behavior of a human-seat-tractor system and to assess the influence of 
were exposed to increased accelerations from 1 to 4 times gravity (4 G). Under these 
conditions, a shift in resonance to a higher frequency was observed, being most pronounced 
between 1 and 2 G. Meanwhile, the STH transmissibility increased distinctly, a phenomenon 
mostly due to the stiffening of the spine. It should be noted that the masses m3 and m5 have 
no actual values; hence, they are considered as small values in the analysis. The schematic 
and biomechanical parameters of the model are listed in Table 2 and Figure 1(b).

(4). Qassem’s model [8, 10] 
Based on the human structure of Patil’s model, an 11-DOF male model with a total mass 
of 91.7 kg was developed. Unlike the hypotheses used in Patil’s model, all springs and 
dampers were assumed to be linear. Moreover, the human back was divided into three 
segments representing cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines having the same spring constant 
and damping coefficient as the back. Also added into the model was a hand-arm system to 
assess the influence of excitation input from it. This model was further modified to study the 
biodynamics of seated female subjects by considering the mass of each segment to be 60% 
of that in the male model. Hence, the total mass of the female model is 55 kg. The physical 
properties were assumed to remain the same. By adding a mass increase of 10.35~12.15 kg 
between the thorax and abdomen at the same ratios to their masses due to 9-month 
pregnancy, a model for seated pregnant subjects was constructed. The schematic and 
biomechanical parameters of the female model are listed in Table 3 and Figure 1(c). 
 
 
where τm is the test datum, τc is the calculated result from each model, and N is the number of test 
data points used in the comparison. In this study the predictions on three response functions for 
each LP model are compared by using equation (1) to obtain the prediction accuracy.

3 BIODYNAMIC EVALUATION OF PREGNANT AND NON-PREGNANT SEATED MODELS 
3.1 Validations of the Modelss 
In this study four LP models are summarized from Tables 1 to 3. All of them were investigated 
following the preceding description. To determine how well each model can anticipate the 
biodynamic responses of seated humans, the mathematical simulations are implemented for both 
pregnant and non-pregnant seated models. From the hypothesis formulated by Qassem and 
Othman [8], the increase in mass due to pregnancy is added to the thorax and abdomen at the 
same ratios to their masses. As a result, for an average increase of 11.25 kg due to a 9-month 
pregnancy, 2.11 kg is added to the thorax and 9.14 kg to the abdomen in Qassem’s model. When 
compared with the assumptions made in this study (2.3 and 8.95 kg), the difference is small. 
However, for a model such as the one developed by Mertens [26], the chest mass segment may 
integrate the thorax and certain other body parts; likewise for the abdomen. Therefore, it is 
important to bear in mind that the distribution of mass increase due to pregnancy should follow 
the physiological characteristics of female bodies. 
As previously mentioned, to mathematically simulate each model, the system EOMs must 
first be derived. Two solution techniques, the FD and TD methods, are then selected to resolve 
3.2 Summary and Discussion 
Since it is very difficult to find measured data specifically implemented for seated 
pregnant subjects, and all models modified to represent them in this study still satisfy the 
conditions specified for the test data in Table 5, the results shown in Figure 2 can provide a 
valuable reference for the assessment of biodynamics in seated pregnant bodies 
Figure 2 indicates that the three biodynamic functions of most of the models have a 
similar trend. The predicted values first increase with an increase in ω, reach peaks, and then 
decrease to constants, except for the DPM impedance in Muksian’s model. Moreover, the 
increase in mass due to pregnancy seems to reduce the resonant frequencies slightly. This 
outcome is obvious since the natural frequency of the system decreases with an increase in 
mass. However, this increase in mass has only a little influence on prediction accuracy. 
The comparisons of the simulation results for all models indicate that the modified 
Muksian’s model has better prediction accuracy for both non-pregnant and pregnant seated 
models. Furthermore, in a study of riding comfort in a vehicle such as the case in the foregoing 
analysis, the driver or passenger is most often assumed to be one rigid mass interconnected 
directly with the vehicle chassis by a set of seat spring and damper. Realistically, it is reasonable 
to recommend the modified Muksian’s model for the evaluation of biodynamic responses of 
seated pregnant human subjects in driving conditions.  
4 EVALUATION OF RIDING MODEL 
4.1 Construction of model 
As also mentioned previously, the sources of vibrations due to road unevenness are mainly 
from the vertical direction. Consequently, a 3-D model with the data listed in Table 6 and as 
shown in Figure 3(a) is commonly used to represent a vehicle dynamic system. In this model, 
the driver located at rx and ry from the vehicle’s center of gravity (CG) in x- and y-axis directions 
is considered as one lumped mass interconnected by a set of seat spring kd and damper cd with the 
vehicle body. A vehicle body of mass Mv5 and mass moment of inertia Ix in the x-axis and Iy in 
the y-axis is assumed to have three DOFs, representing bouncing motion zv5, pitch motion θ, 
and rolling motion φ. The suspension system is modeled by 4 unsprung masses Mv1, Mv2, Mv3, 
and Mv4 connected to the vehicle body by 4 sets of springs ks1, ks2, ks3, and ks4 and dampers cs1, 
cs2, cs3, and cs4, respectively. These 4 masses only consider bouncing motion and the 4 springs kt1, 
kt2, kt3, and kt4 represent tire properties. The CG is allocated at lf to the front axle and lr to the 
rear axle; and tLf to the left-front tire, tRf to the right-front tire, tLr to the left-rear tire, and tRr to 
the right-rear tire, respectively. As a result, this 3-D model has a total of 8 DOFs, while the 
inputs originate from the tire-ground contact points, z01, z02, z03, and z04, respectively. 
To simplify the problem for the case of a uniform road profile at the same input forms for 
the left and right tires, a 2-D model can be used. In this situation, the rolling motion can be 
neglected, and the four suspension sets of the vehicle can be reduced to two. On the basis of 
the general theory of vehicle dynamics, the aforementioned 3-D model can be simplified to a 2-D 
model, as shown in Figure 3 (b). As shown in this figure, the unsprung masses of the front and 
rear axles, the suspension springs and dampers, and the tire springs are simply twice the values 
of those in the 3-D model. Consequently, this 2-D vehicle system has 5 DOFs. 
4.2 Simulations of evaluation models 
To further prove the simplification of aforementioned hypothesis, a vehicle with parameters 
in Table 6 is assumed to cross over two road surfaces, as shown in Figure 4. These two surfaces 
have the same sinusoidal double-bump profile with peak amplitude of 0.1 meter. When traveling 
over road A, as in Figure 4(a), a vehicle is assumed to have the same input to left and right tires 
starting from 0.5 second. Meanwhile, both front and rear tires follow the same profile, but with a 
time delay consisting of the ratio of the wheelbase to the velocity. On the other hand, the profile

5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE STUDY 
A study of biodynamic models of seated human subjects suitable for representing pregnant 
women exposed to vertical vibrations has been implemented. These LP models from literature 
have been analyzed and validated in terms of STH transmissibility, DPM impedance, and AP 
mass by the synthesis of various experimental data. Also, a 3-D full-car model with given 
parameters was selected for integration with pregnant and non-pregnant seated models and an 
integrated human-vehicle system constructed with 14 DOFs. From the analysis and validation, 
the following comments can be expressed: 
1. LP human models are limited to only one-dimensional analysis. Therefore, the human bodies 
in this study were considered to be sitting erect without backrest support, irrespective of 
hand positions, while the feet were supported and allowed to vibrate. The mathematical 
models included linear and nonlinear systems with varying degrees of complexity, 
depending on the analytical objective. 
2. A 3-D full-car model takes the rolling motion of the vehicle into consideration; therefore, 
this model can simulate dynamic behavior under vertical vibration exposure more realistically, 
since most road inputs from left and right wheels are different. 
3. It is believed that this study has provided a profound understanding of the biodynamic 
responses of both pregnant and non-pregnant subjects exposed to vertical vibrations. Also, 
a procedure for evaluating the riding quality of an integrated human-vehicle system which is 
practical for real-world situations has been recommended. This research can also provide 
some insights for the study of vibration transmission through the seated human body. Future 
studies may be extended to the following fields of study: 
(1). An optimization procedure can be used to construct the pregnant models with requisite 
complexity. The objective functions include previously mentioned three biodynamic 
functions having dangerous frequencies which are hazardous for a pregnant woman. 
These functions also have anthropometric data of the human body as constraints. 
(2). The biodynamic behavior of the seated human body in this study is limited to vertical 
direction. However, longitudinal and lateral loading is also observed by the driver in 
daily driving events. Hence, further investigation on multibody models to include the 
influence of posture change on the biodynamics of the seated humans, and also to 
compensate the behaviors due to different directions of inputs, will be needed. The 
evaluation recommend in this study can be extended to multi-axis analysis.
