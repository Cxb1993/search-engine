radicals in sufficient quantity to effect wastewater treatment (Chou et al., 1999; Lu et al., 
2003; Ting et al., 2007; Sengil and ozacar, 2006). Although AOPs were classified as 
expensive treatment option, the cost can be minimized and optimized from different 
aspects, such as apply methodologies for catalyst recycling and integration of chemical and 
biological treatment processes (Brillas et al., 2002; Badellino et al., 2006; Sirés et al., 
2007a; Sirés et al., 2007b; Esplugas and Ollis, 1997).  
Hydrogen peroxide was first used to reduce odor in wastewater treatment plants, and 
from then on, hydrogen peroxide entered the realm of wastewater treatment. Hydrogen 
peroxide is a non-contaminating oxidant because its products are non-toxic substances, and 
can conform to strict environmental regulations (Elizardo, 1991). Besides, some 
contaminants may be oxidized into biologically degradable matter using hydrogen 
peroxide, and oxygen produced from hydrogen peroxide is also supplied to enhance the 
biodegradability. 
The Fenton reaction is a widely used and studied catalytic process based on an 
electron transfer between H2O2 and a metal acting as a homogeneous catalyst 
(Safarzadeh-Amiri et al., 1996). The reactivity of this system was first observed in 1894 by 
its inventor H.J.H. Fenton, but its utility was not recognized until the 1930s when a 
mechanism based on hydroxyl radicals was proposed (Walling, 1975). The process may be 
applied to wastewaters, sludge, and contaminated soils to reduce toxicity, improve 
biodegradability, and remove odor and color (Pignatello et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2001; Lu et 
al., 2003). During the Fenton process, hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by ferrous ion to 
produce hydroxyl radicals (Walling, 1975).

+ + − •+ → + +                                                 (1.1) 
This reaction is propagated from ferrous ion regeneration mainly by the reduction of 
the produced ferric species with hydrogen peroxide (Walling, 1973), 
 4
2007b; Brillas et al., 2000; Brillas et al., 2003; Brillas et al., 2007). More potent 
electro-Fenton methods with UV irradiation are also being developed for wastewater 
remediation, so-called photoelectro-Fenton process (Sirés et al., 2007a; Brillas et al., 2003; 
Brillas et al., 2000; Brillas et al., 2007; Brillas et al., 1998). The process was irradiated 
with UV light under electro-Fenton conditions. The action of this irradiation is complex 
and can be described as: (i) the production of a greater amount of hydroxyl radicals from 
the photoreduction of Fe(OH)2+, the predominant Fe3+ species in acid medium (Pignatello 
et al., 2006), by equation (1.6) and (ii) the photolysis of complexes of Fe(Ⅲ) with 
generated carboxylic acids, as shown in equation (1.7) (Pignatello et al., 2006; Exposito et 
al., 2007).

The maximum adsorption wavelength of Fe(OH)2+ species is less than 360 nm, hence 
visible irradiation may not drive the reaction of equation (1.6). An interesting and 
potentially useful modification of the photoreduction reaction takes advantage of the 
photo-lability of Fe(Ⅲ)-oxalate complexes, which can be efficiently decomposed up to 500 
nm (Pignatello et al., 2006). Oxalic acid is produced during the oxidation of most organics. 
Under these conditions, it is also feasible to used sunlight as an alternative inexpensive 
source, so-called sunlight-assisted electro-Fenton technology (Casado et al., 2005).

electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes were also investigated in the study.

peroxide into the subsurface have been successfully attempted to enhance the 
biodegradation activity (Calabrese and Kostecki, 1989). Hydrogen peroxide can be 
decomposed into water and oxygen by enzymatic and nonenzymatic routes.  
Oxidation by hydrogen peroxide alone is not effective for high concentrations of 
certain refractory contaminants, such as highly chlorinated aromatic compounds and 
inorganic compounds (e.g. cyanides), because of low rates of reaction at reasonable 
hydrogen peroxide concentrations. Transition metal salts (e.g. iron salts), ozone and 
UV-light can activate hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl radicals which are strong 
oxidants:

The oxidation processes utilizing activation of hydrogen peroxide by iron salts, referred to 
as Fenton’s reagent, are discussed below. 
In general, oxidation processes which are based on the generation of radical 
intermediates are termed advanced oxidation techniques (Venkatadri and Peeters, 1993). 
Hydroxyl radicals (oxidation potential: 2.8 V) are stronger oxidants than ozone and 
hydrogen peroxide. Hydroxyl radicals non-specifically oxidize target compounds at high 
reaction rates (of the order of 109 M−1s−1 as described later).

As seen in equation (2.8), hydrogen peroxide can act as a hydroxyl radical’s scavenger as 
well as an initiator (equation (1.1)). Hydroxyl radicals can oxidize organics (RH) by 
abstraction of protons producing organic radicals (R•), which are highly reactive and can be 
further oxidized (Walling and Kato, 1971; Venkatadri and Peters, 1993; Lin and Lo, 1997). 
2     RH HO H O R further oxidation
• •+ → + →                               (2.9) 
Since k6 = 107 M−1s−1 while k2>108 (equation (2.3)) can be made unimportant by 
maintaining a high [RH]/[H2O2] ratio. 
Walling (1975) simplified the overall Fenton chemistry by accounting for the 
dissociation water: 
2 3
2 2 22     2 2   2Fe H O H Fe H O
+ + ++ + → +                      (2.10) 
This equation suggests that the presence of H+ is required in the decomposition of H2O2, 
indicating the need for an acid environment to produce the maximum amount of hydroxyl 
radicals. Previous Fenton studies have shown that acidic pH levels near 3 are usually 
optimum for Fenton oxidations (Hickey et al., 1995). In the presence of organic substrates 
(RH), excess ferrous ion, and at low pH, hydroxyl radicals can add to the aromatic or 
heterocyclic rings (as well as to the unsaturated bonds of alkenes or alkynes) 
 
 
They can also abstract a hydrogen atom, initiating a radical chain oxidation (Walling, 1975; 
 12
This is because the hydroxyl radicals produced as a result of equation (1.1) mainly 
react with the ferrous ion (equation (2.3)) instead of hydrogen peroxide (equation (2.8)). 
This explanation is supported by the fact that the reaction between hydroxyl radical and the 
ferrous ion is ten times faster than that between hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide 
(k2 = 3.2×108 M−1s−1 and k7 = 3.3×107 M−1s−1).

2     RH HO H O R further oxidation
• •+ → + →                               (2.9) 
On the other hand, the presence of RH affects only the behavior of the ferrous ion, not 
the hydrogen peroxide. This is because the organics compete with ferrous ion for hydroxyl 
radicals (equations (2.3) and (2.9)). The presence of organics reduces the 
△[Fe2+]/△[H2O2] ratio to less than two (△[Fe2+]/△[H2O2] ≈ 1.3), which means that the 
ferrous ion is utilized as a major reactant, not as a catalyst in the Fenton reaction. 
Yoon et al. (2001) studied the effect of the Fenton reaction in the removal of landfill 
leachate organics. They used a [Fe2+]0/[H2O2]0 ratio of 1.25. In that case, the Fenton 
reaction can be divided into two processes. The first process is an initial oxidation at a low 
pH of about 3. The second process, which follows the oxidation process, is coagulation at a 
high pH of 7~8. It is interpreted that the coagulation step in the Fenton reaction had a 
primary role in the selective removal of organics, even though the Fenton reaction is not a 
coagulation one. 
However, since the efficiency of organic removal in the Fenton reaction was higher 
than coagulation, the Fenton reaction in landfill leachate treatment process may be called a 
type of “enhanced coagulation”.

and the ferrous ion, which may have been the major route of hydroxyl radicals 
consumption in the absence of RH. Therefore, the remaining ferrous ion can react with the 
hydrogen peroxide and show a slightly higher consumption of hydrogen peroxide at the 
initial stage of the reaction as compared with that observed in the absence of RH. 
2.2.3.3. Low ratio of [Fe2+]0/[H2O2]0 (<<1) 
In the absence of RH, a slow decomposition of hydrogen peroxide occurs caused by 
ferric ion, which induces radical chain reactions (ferric system) immediately after the 
initial rapid depletion of hydrogen peroxide. However, the presence of RH almost stops the 
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by ferric ion (ferric system). At a low ratio of 
△[Fe2+]0/△[H2O2]0 (<<1), hydroxyl radicals react to a greater extent with hydrogen 
peroxide, producing HO•2 via equation (2.8). Therefore, additional HO•2 can participate in 
propagating radical chain reactions by reducing ferric to ferrous ion (equation (2.7)), and 
can result in larger consumption of hydrogen peroxide than that occurs in the absence of 
RH.

2.2.3.4. Influence of the structure of hazardous components 
Kinetic degradation of aromatic pollutants with the system Fe2+/H2O2 was reported 
earlier (Yoon et al., 1998; Wei et al., 1990; Lipczynska-Kochany, 1991) but less attention 
was given to the mineralization of these substances. The degradation of alicyclic 
compounds was given little attention since most of the water pollutants with a low 
biodegradability have an aromatic structure. 
Ruppert and Bauer (1993) studied the influence of the structure of several organic 
pollutants on the way they are mineralized by OH-radicals. All of the aromatic substances 
 16
oxidation can be considered, and have proved to be interesting subjects for different 
research groups and industries seeking new technologies for wastewater treatment (Chen, 
2004; Carlos et al., 2006). 
In recent years, the applications of electrochemistry for environmental pollution have 
been thoroughly investigated (Chen, 2004; Juttner et al., 2000). The feasibility of 
electrochemical destruction of organic substrates in wastewater, in particular, has attracted 
much attention since pioneering studies by Comninellis in the 60s, Dabrowski in the 70s, 
Kirk, Stucki, Kotz, Chettiar and Watkinson in the 80s to the present day. In these studies, 
the influence of the electrode material has been considered in detail, showing that optimal 
conditions for the process are obtained at high-oxygen-overpotential anodes (Carlos et al., 
2006). 
Electrochemistry, as a branch of physical chemistry plays an important role in most 
areas of science and technology (Grimm et al., 1998). Electrochemistry offers promising 
approaches for the prevention of pollution problems in the process industry. The inherent 
advantage is its environmental compatibility, due to the fact that it uses a clean reagent, the 
electron. The strategies include both the treatment of effluents and waste and the 
development of new processes or products with less harmful effects, often denoted as 
process-integrated environmental protection. The promising characteristics of approaches 
for the prevention and remediation of pollution problems have been explained in detail: 
(Rajeshwar et al., 1994, 1997). 
(i) Versatility: Several techniques can be applied such as direct and/or indirect oxidations 
and reductions, phase separations, biocide functions, concentrations (or 
dilutions), and electrochemical methods can deal with many pollutants and 
treat from microliters to millions of liters. 
(ii) Energy efficiency: These processes generally require lower temperature with respect to 
 18
2.3.1. Anodic oxidation mechanism 
Electrochemical oxidation of pollutants can occur directly at anodes through the 
generation of physically adsorbed “active oxygen” (adsorbed hydroxyl radicals, HO·) or 
chemisorbed “active oxygen” (oxygen in the oxide lattice, MOx+1) (Comninellis, 1994). 
This process is usually called “anodic oxidation” or “direct oxidation” and the course for 
the anodic oxidation was described by Comninellis (1994), the complete destruction of the 
organic substrate or its selective conversion into oxidation products is schematically 
represented in Figure 2.1. 
When a toxic, non-biocompatible pollutant is treated, the electrochemical conversion 
transforms the organic substrate into a variety of metabolites; often, biocompatible 
organics are generated, and biological treatment is still required after the electrochemical 
oxidation. In contrast, electrochemical degradation yields water and CO2, no further 
purification being necessary. Nevertheless, the feasibility of this process depends on three 
parameters: (i) the generation of chemically or physically adsorbed hydroxyl radicals, (ii) 
the nature of the anodic material and (iii) the process competition with the oxygen 
evolution reaction (Carlos et al., 2006). 
 
 
 
 
 
 20
The electrochemical oxidation of some organics in aqueous media may take place 
without any loss in electrode activity, except at high potentials, and with concomitant 
evolution of oxygen (Comninellis et al., 1995, 1996, 1998; Thar et al., 1998). Furthermore, 
it has been described that the nature of the electrode material strongly influences both the 
selectivity and the efficiency of the process. To interpret these observations, a 
comprehensive model for the anodic oxidation of organics in acidic medium, including the 
competition with the oxygen evolution reaction, has been proposed (Comninellis et al., 
1994, 1996; Foti, 1997; Simond, 1997). More recent results, obtained at conductive 
diamond electrodes (which are characterized by very high oxygen overpotential), fit the 
model predictions quite well (Marselli et al., 2003). Based on these results, Comninellis 
explained the differences considering two limiting cases, i.e. the so-called “active” and 
“non-active” anodes. 
In both cases, the first equation (2.16) is the oxidation of water molecules leading to 
the formation of adsorbed hydroxyl radicals: 
2 ( )M H O M HO H e
• + −+ → + +                                           (2.16) 
Both the electrochemical and chemical reactivities of adsorbed hydroxyl radicals depend 
strongly on the nature of the used electrode material. With active electrodes there is a 
strong interaction between the electrode (M) and the hydroxyl radical. Adsorbed hydroxyl 
radicals may interact with the anode, forming a higher oxide MO (equation (2.17)).  
( )M HO MO H e• + −→ + +                                               (2.17) 
These may be the case when higher oxidation states are available, for the electrode 
material, above the thermo-dynamic potential for the oxygen evolution (1.23 V vs. SHE) 
(Comninellis et al., 1994). 
 With active electrodes, the redox couple MO/M acts as a mediator in the oxidation of 
organics (equation (2.18)). This reaction is in competition with the side reaction of oxygen 
 22
evolution) and chemical reactivity (rate of the organics oxidation with electrogenerated 
hydroxyl radicals) of adsorbed HO· are strongly linked to the strength of the M-HO· 
interaction. As a general rule, the weaker the interaction, the higher the anode reactivity for 
organics oxidation (fast chemical reaction); boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDD) are 
typical non-active electrodes, characterized by high stability and acceptable conductivity. 
This model assumes that the electrochemical oxidation is mediated by hydroxyl radicals, 
either adsorbed at the surface (in the case of active electrodes) or free, in the case of the 
non-active ones (Marselli et al., 2003). 
2.3.2. Electro-Fenton method 
Electro-Fenton methods broadly include electrochemical reactions that are used to 
generate in situ one or both of the reagents for the Fenton reaction. The reagent(s) 
generated depend on cell potential, solution conditions and the nature of the electrodes. 
Several different types of electro-Fenton reactions have been described, as summarized in 
Table 2.1.

  +−+ →+ 23 FeeFe   
 
Ferrous ions may be produced by oxidative dissolution of sacrificial anodes such as 
iron metal (Pratap and Lemley, 1994; Roe and Lemley, 1997; Wang and Lemley, 2001; 
Saltmiras and Lemley, 2001; Chou et al., 1999; Arienzo et al., 2001a, 2001b) or titanium 
and iron (Huang et al., 1999): 
−+ +→ eFeFe 220                                                       (1.3) 
 24
(accelerated by addition of Fe2+) in the cathode chamber.  
In principle the most promising electro-Fenton mode is Type 3 (Table 2.1), in which 
ferric ion is reduced to ferrous at the cathode. However, Fe2+ regeneration is slow even at 
optimal current density, and both current density and current efficiency drop off 
precipitously above pH~2.5. As an active area of research, further advances are expected in 
electro-Fenton reactions. 
 
2.4. The photo assisted Fenton reaction 
Irradiation of reaction solutions with ultraviolet (UV) or UV/visible light almost 
invariably leads to faster rates and higher yields of inorganic products (e.g., Pignatello, 
1992; Ruppert et al., 1993; Kiwi et al., 1994; Lei et al., 1998; DeLaat et al., 1999; 
Balanosky et al., 2000; Benitez et al., 2000). Photoenhancement will be observed even in 
the presence of ordinary overhead fluorescent light used to illuminate laboratory space. 
Enhancement is due nearly entirely to the photochemistry of Fe(III). Fe(II) complexes 
undergo ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excitation, dissociating to give Fe(II) and 
an oxidized ligand, Lox (Balzani and Carassiti, 1970; Sima and Makanova, 1997):

The photochemistry of Fe(III) is advantageous to Fenton AOPs because the reduced iron 
can then react with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals (equation (1.1)) and 
because oxidation of the ligand may lead to further degradation of the target pollutant (e.g., 
Pignatello, 1992; Sun and Pignatello, 1993; Safarzadeh-Amiri et al., 1996; Bandara et al., 
1997; Bossmann et al., 1998). The photolysis of Fe(II) species is unimportant at 
wavelengths employed in Fenton AOPs. Hydrogen peroxide also photolyzes with UV 
light: 
 26
2.4.2. Photolysis of Fe(III) complexes with organic ligands 
Fe(II) may complex with certain target compounds or their byproducts, especially 
those acting as polydentate ligands. These complexes typically have higher molar 
absorption coefficients in the near-UV and visible regions than do the aquo complexes. 
Their excitation leads to the production of Fe2+ and a ligand radical by the generalized 
equation (2.26) with quantum yields that are wavelength dependent. Polychromatic 
quantum efficiencies in the UV/visible for different complexes range from ~0.05 to ~0.95 
(Ronco and Aymonino, 1987; Pohl et al., 1988; Andrianirinaharivelo et al., 1995; Bandara 
et al., 1996; Van der Zee et al., 1993).  
The photoreactivity of Fe(III)-carboxylate or Fe(Ill)-polycarboxylate complexes is 
well-known and usually leads to decarboxylation of the organic ligand (Balzani and 
Carassiti, 1970):

An interesting and potentially useful modification of the photo-Fenton reaction takes 
advantage of the photo-lability of Fe(III)-oxalate complexes (Safarzadeh-Amiri et al., 1996, 
1997; Hislop and Bolton, 1999), which is efficient up to 500 nm (Φ) = 1.0~1.2). Ferric 
oxalate is commonly used as a chemical actinometer (Hatchard and Parker, 1956; Braun et 
al., 1991). Bolton and coworkers added oxalate to reaction solutions and obtained 
photoreduction of the resulting ferrioxalate complexes in situ, such as

and obtained degradation of aromatic and chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated 
ethenes, ethers, alcohols, and ketones (Safarzadeh-Amiri et al., 1996, 1997). Oxalate 
addition also enhanced photo-Fenton degradation of the herbicide diuron in goethite 
suspensions by accelerating photoreductive dissolution of iron (Mazellier and Sulzberger, 
2001): 
 28
First, Fe(III) complexes often exhibit higher absorbances and higher quantum yields 
than simple aquated Fe(III) species, and therefore may be more important in photo-Fenton 
systems. For example, the mixture of 2,4-dimethylaniline and Fe(III) at pH 3 photolyzes 
with a quantum yield of 0.92 for Fe(II) production (Bossmann et al., 1998), compared to 
<0.2 for aquated complexes. The photolysis of Fe(III)-carboxylate or -polycarboxylate 
complexes likely play a dominant role when they are present. Photodecarboxylation, in fact, 
often accounts for a substantial fraction of carbon mineralization, especially when the 
target compound is aromatic (Casado et al., 2005; Sun and Pignatello, 1993b, 1993c). For 
example, 60% of CO2 evolved from 2,4-D was attributed to Fe(III)-catalyzed 
photodecarboxylation principally of oxalic acid resulting from advanced degradation of the 
aromatic ring (Sun and Pignatello, 1993b, 1993c). Oxalic acid is a major product of 
aromatic ring degradation and its complexes with Fe(III) are very stable to hydroxyl 
radicals attack in the dark. These examples help explain why complete mineralization often 
cannot be achieved using the Fenton reaction in the dark.

Second, although photolysis of hydrogen peroxide (equation (2.21)) has a relatively 
high quantum yield, its contribution in photo-Fenton applications is limited by the weak 
absorption of light by hydrogen peroxide and the strong “inner filter effect” due to 
absorption of light by iron and organic solutes (especially aromatics). However, hydrogen 
peroxide photolysis may contribute to hydroxyl radical production at low concentration of 
iron and organic absorbers or at very large concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. 
Third, while in theory rate should increase with radiant power, in practice there may 
be an upper limit reached when photoreduction of iron outpaces its reoxidation, that is, 
when iron in the +III state becomes a small fraction of total iron.

(photoelectro- Fenton). Photochemical regeneration of Fe2+ by the photoreduction of Fe3+ 
ions and p-activation of complexes renders the photoelectro-Fenton system more efficient 
(Brillas et al., 2003a; Boye et al., 2003). At acidic pH, oxalic acids behave as photo-active 
complexes in the presence of ferric ions which undergo photo-decarboxylation reaction 
(Pignatello et al., 2006):

Environmental application of the photoelectro-Fenton process is fairly a new topic 
and previous studies are quite limited. The most part of these studies have comprised to 
treatability of some specific pollutants such as some kinds of herbicides (Boye et al., 2002; 
Irmak et al., 2006; Boye et al., 2003; Brillas et al., 2003b), some kinds of dyes (Flox et al., 
2006; Rao et al., 2006) and some kinds of organics (Brillas et al., 2002; Boye et al., 2006). 
In addition, Flox et al. (2007) have recently used solar energy as photon source, and 
reduced operating costs of the process substantially. However, in order to increase the 
environmental application of the process, researchers should focus on real wastewaters. 
 
2.5.2. Overview of the earlier work of the photoelectro-Fenton process 
In conclusion, the use of photoelectro-Fenton technique for the destruction of 
pollutants is new to the researchers. Table 2.2 gives the list of chemicals degraded by the 
photoelectro-Fenton process and the references. Some of the illustrative works in recent 
years have been discussed in detail so as to establish the optimum operating parameters 
and other critical considerations for attaining maximum efficiency of this hybrid oxidation 
technique.

3. Ferrous ions concentration 
The investigation of accumulated ferrous ions during the reaction at different current 
densities on cathode and 1 mM of Fe3+ and pHi=2.0. The Fe2+ concentration was 
determined by light absorbance measurement at 510 nm after complexing with 
1,10-phenanthroline using a Unicam UV-Visible spectrophotometer (APHA, 1998). 
4. Hydrogen peroxide concentration 
The residual H2O2 was determined photometrically using potassium titanium oxalate 
in mineral acid (Wagner and Ruck, 1984; Roland et al., 1997). The formula of titanium 
reagent was described as follows: 272 ml H2SO4 and 35.4 g K2TiO(C2O4)2·2H2O were 
placed in 300 ml D.I. water and then diluted the mixture with D.I. water to 1000 ml. 
Finally, mix this titanium reagent with the sample. The titanium-H2O2 complex was 
analyzed photometrically at 400 nm. Before the measurements were made, calibration 
curve was plotted using standard H2O2 of known concentration.

reactor (radius: 6.5 cm and height: 35 cm) was operated at a constant current mode. The 
total volume of the reactor was 3.5 liters. The anode used was titanium net coated with 
RuO2/IrO2 (DSA), and the cathode was made of stainless steel. The double electrode cell 
had a DSA anode with an inside diameter of 7 cm, and the cathode had 2 cm and 13 cm 
stainless steel walls.

predetermined quantity of ferrous concentration was added after the pH was adjusted to the 
desired value. Solution pH was not controlled during the reaction. The hydrogen peroxide 
was added to initiate the reaction. The oxidation reaction was stopped instantly by adding 
NaOH to the reaction mixtures after sampling. The samples were then filtered with 0.45 
µm to remove precipitates before analysis.

ion, V is the volume of the solution, A is the operating current, and t is the reaction time. 
Since the current was kept constant, the amount of generated Fe2+ was proportional to the 
electrolysis time. 
Figure 4.2 shows the effect of cathode geometry on the generated ferrous 
concentration. According to our past experience, a single working electrode does not 
significantly enhance the electro-regeneration of ferrous ions. For this reason, we 
developed a double cathode electrolysis cell (Figure 3.3 (a)) to increase the working area 
and to promote current efficiency. As shown in equations (4.4) and (1.4), the small working 
area on the anode was designed to minimize the oxidation of ferrous ions and to promote 
the reduction of ferric ions on the cathode. At the cathode, ferric ions were 
electrochemically reduced to ferrous ions in an acidic solution. Simultaneously, H2 
evolution may occur as the side reaction which reduces the current efficiency. At the anode, 
the oxidation of H2O leads to oxygen evolution and proton release. Consequently the 
ferrous concentration increased with increasing in the cathode working area. Figure 4.3 
shows the effect of cathode geometry on initial current efficiency (Figure 3.3 (a) and (b)). 
The double cathode reactor could increase the current efficiency by 7 %, which would 
translate to greater ferrous production and a higher degradation rate of organic compounds 
in the electro-Fenton process. A 41 % current efficiency was observed using the double 
cathode electrochemical cell when CDc= 71.0 A/m2 and CDa= 75.8 A/m2. The CDc and 
CDa denote the current densities of the cathode and anode, respectively. Chou et al. (1999) 
reported that the initial current efficiency of Fe2+ regeneration was 39 % at [Fe3+]0 = 1000 
mg/L, CDc= 98 A/m2 and CDa= 980 A/m2 in the constant current mode. It should be 
pointed out that the double cathode electrochemical cell has more potential for the 
improvement of the efficiency of electricity utilization.

4.1.2. Energy consumption with different electrode distance 
 
To simplify the analysis, only electricity was considered. The energy consumption 
was calculated for electrode distances of 3.0 cm and 5.5 cm for the electro-Fenton process, 
respectively, when 1 kg COD needs to be removed. The energy cost for each device was 
obtained from equation (4.8).

Resistance /oltage urrentV C=                                                 (4.9) 
 
Where A is the operating current, Voltage is the voltage, V is the volume of the solution, 
t is the reaction time andΔCOD denotes the experimental COD decay in solution. The 
experimental results with regard to COD removal and energy consumption are shown in 
Table 4.1. Although the current efficiency of the 5.5 cm device is 19 % higher than 3.0 cm, 
results show that after 2 hours of electrolysis the electronic expense using an electrode gap 
of 5.5 cm is much higher than 3.0 cm. The result suggests that the electrode distance 3.0 
cm device can provide more economical operation.  
This phenomenon is due to equation (4.9). Long electrode distance will increace the 
resistance causing the voltage and electricity cost to be higher. The results were compared 
with the results obtained by Brillas et al, when aniline was treated with Ti/Pt anode and 
carbon-PTFE cathode (Brillas et al., 2002). The electro-Fenton process used by Brillas has 
a higher energy cost (45 kWhm-3 for 2 hrs) than this system (39 kWhm-3 at 2 hr, the data 
calculated from 3.0 cm device: Figure 3.3 (b)).

4.1.3. Effect of hydrogen peroxide feeding mode 
As shown in Figure 4.6, the residues in turn depend on the method of chemical 
addition, for example, single-step or multi-step addition; thus, affect the process 
performance. Multi-step addition of chemical was considered due to that the initial 
application of one reactant might be in excess of the other. To avoid the excessive 
application or rather the waste of chemical, the step additions appears to be attractive. 
Bowers et al. (1989) and Mohanty and Wei (1993) used the Fenton process for degradation 
of toxic organics and reported that multi-step addition of H2O2 shows a removal efficiency 
better than one-step addition, without further explanation of cause and effect. Hence, it is 
also desirable to know if the multi-step addition of hydrogen peroxide will lead to any 
improvement in the performance of Fenton, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton 
processes. 
Figure 4.6 presents the comparison of single-step and multi-step additions of H2O2 by 
electro-Fenton process. The amount of H2O2 applied was 166 mM in one-step addition, and 
16.6 mM in ten-step addition at times of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80 and 100 min. 
Multi-step addition of H2O2 was slightly better in front of 80 min compared with single 
step addition. Similar observations were derived when multi-step H2O2 addition was 
employed to treat landfill leachate by electro-Fenton process (Zhang et al., 2006). The 
COD removal ratio was improved by multi-step addition as much as 10% in electro-Fenton 
process at the first 20 min. That is because the ferrous ion is regenerated via the reduction 
of ferric ion on the cathode induce the Fenton chain reaction. Thus, stepwise addition 
keeps the hydrogen peroxide concentration at relatively low levels, reducing the 
detrimental effect of hydroxyl radical scavenging (equation (2.8)).

4.2. Kinetics of 2,6-DMA degradation by electro-Fenton process 
 
Based on the results of current efficiency and energy consumption, the double cathode 
device (Figure 3.3 (a)) should be used for further oxidation research. In this part of 
research, the effects of initial pH (pHi), Fe2+ loading, H2O2 concentration and current 
density on the processes were investigated. In addition, the study also concerned the 
degradation performance of the Fenton, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes. 
 
4.2.1. Effect of pH 
The pH of the solution controls the production of the hydroxyl radical and the 
concentration of ferrous ions (Pignatello et al., 2006; Abad et al., 2007; Muruganandham 
and Swaminathan, 2004; Sun et al., 2007). Hence, pH is an important parameter for the 
electro-Fenton process. The effect of pH on the degradation of 2,6-DMA is shown in 
Figure 4.7. Increasing the pHi from 1.5 to 2.0 decreased the remaining from 36% to 25% in 
2 hours. A further increase of pHi from 2 to 4 increased the remaining from 25% to 85%. 
At pHi 3, only a small amount of Fe2+ is observed. Above this pH, Fe3+ started to be 
precipitated in the form of amorphous Fe(OH)3(s). The formation of Fe(OH)3(s) not only 
decreased the dissolved Fe3+ concentration, but also inhibited Fe2+ regeneration by partially 
coating the electrode surface. The optimum pH was found to be about 2. It is in good 
agreement with early reports (Lu et al., 2003; Chou et al., 1999; Sirés et al., 2007a; Li et al., 
2007; Qiang et al., 2003).

4.2.2. Effect of Fe2+ loading 
 
The first-order rate constants (kobs) were determined from the slopes of the plots of 
ln([2,6-DNA]t/[2,6-DNA]0) vs. time and for reaction time ≤ 120 minutes (R≥0.99). The 
effect of Fe2+ concentration on the kinetic rate constants, kobs, for 2,6-DMA degradation 
was studied by varying [Fe2+]0 from 1.0 to 2.0 mM. The results are presented in Figure 4.8. 
It can be seen from Table 2 that the kobs of 2,6-DMA degradation increased with increasing 
Fe2+ concentration from 1.0 to 1.5 mM. This is due to the fact that Fe2+ plays a very 
important role in initiating the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to generate the 
hydroxyl radical in the Fenton process. When the concentrations of Fe2+ and hydroxyl 
radical are high, Fe2+ can react with the hydroxyl radical according to equation (2.3). 
 
2 3Fe OH Fe OH+ • + −+ → +                                k = 3.2×108 M-1s-1 (2.3)

The kobs does not increase significantly as the dosage of ferrous ions increased from 1.5 
mM to 2.0 mM. The rate constant in equation (2.3) has a value of several orders of 
magnitude higher than that in equation (1.2) and (1.4). Hence, the excess ferrous ions 
consumed the hydroxyl radicals with a high oxidative potential. It caused the ferric 
reduction efficiency to be lower than in equation (2.3). However, it is not a good idea to 
use over high concentration of Fe2+. Otherwise, a large quantity of ferric oxide sludge will 
be generated, resulting in much more requirement of separation and disposal of the sludge.

4.2.3. Effect of H2O2 molar concentration 
 The initial concentration of H2O2 plays an important role in the electro-Fenton process. 
The effect of the H2O2 concentration on the 2,6-DMA degradation is shown in Figure 4.9. 
Increasing the H2O2 concentration from 10 mM to 25 mM increased the removal efficiency, 
46%, at 120 min. A further increase from 25 mM to 30 mM decreased the removal 
efficiency, 35%. The increase in the removal efficiency was due to the increase in hydroxyl 
radical concentration as a result of the addition of H2O2. However, at a high dosage of 
H2O2, the decrease in removal efficiency was due to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect 
of H2O2 (equation (2.8) and (4.11)) and the recombination of the hydroxyl radical 
(equation (4.12)) (Muruganandham and Swaminathan, 2004).

 The first-order rate constants (kobs) were determined from the slopes of the plots of 
ln([2,6-DNA]t/[2,6-DNA]0) vs. time and for reaction time ≤ 120 minutes (R≥0.97). The 
results shown in Figure 4.9 indicates that from 10 mM to 25 mM, the reaction was 
first-order, reflecting equation (1.2) as the rate limiting step. Above 25 mM, the rate was 
inhibited by the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of H2O2 and the recombination of the 
hydroxyl radical (Li et al., 2007).

4.2.4. Effect of current density 
Figure 4.10 shows the effect of current density for the 2,6-DMA degradation, which 
was significant. Increasing the current density increased the production rate of Fe2+ on the 
cathode. Therefore, the removal efficiency increased with increasing current density. In this 
work, the removal efficiency was 58%, 75% and 91% for current densities of 3.50, 7.10 
and 10.6 A/m2, respectively. The results further indicate that the effect of the apparent 
current density on the removal efficiency was significant indicating that the production rate 
of Fe2+ was increased with increasing current. It should be pointed out that the optimal 
current density also depends on the Fe3+ concentration because Fe3+ mass transfer also 
controls the ferric reduction efficiency (Chou et al., 1999; Qiang et al., 2005). 
Figure 4.11 shows the effect of current density on the (a) remaining ratio (b) 
concentration of accumulated ferrous ion and (c) k value for the 2,6-DMA degradation in 
60 minutes. The first-order rate constants (kobs) were determined from the slopes of the 
plots of ln([2,6-DNA]t/[2,6-DNA]0) vs. time and for reaction time ≤ 120 minutes (R≥0.97). 
The effect of current density on the kinetic rate constants, kobs, for 2,6-DMA degradation 
was studied by varying the current density from 3.5 to 10.60 A/m2. The results are 
presented in Figure 4.10. It can be seen from kobs that the 2,6-DMA degradation was 
increased with the increase of current density from 3.5 to 10.6 A/m2. This was due to the 
higher electro-regeneration of ferrous ions from ferric ions (equation (1.4)) with increasing 
the current density, which increased the efficiency of the Fenton chain reactions.

exhibited good decomposition ability on the degradation of organic contaminants in this 
work. It is due to the fact that ferrous ion catalyst can be regenerated though the 
photoreduction of ferric ions. It then catalyzes hydrogen peroxide to produce highly 
reactive hydroxyl radicals. These findings confirm the significant contribution the 
additional generation of hydroxyl radicals in the photoelectro-Fenton process. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 74
 The role of UVA irradiation in promoting the oxidation efficiency of 2,6-DMA could 
be clearly illustrated with the values obtained in Table 4.4. The ratios of UVA irradiation 
promoting the efficiency on the initial rates of 2,6-DMA could be obtained as follows: 
 
rPE-F/rE-F = Initial rate of PE-F /Initial rate of E-F                             (4.15) 
 
Where rPE-F represents the initial rate of the photoelectro-Fenton process and rE-F represents 
the initial rate of the electro-Fenton process. The initial oxidation rate by hydroxyl radicals 
of organic compound in the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes can be 
expresses as equation (4.16) and (4.17), respectively (Benitez et al., 2001): 
 
[ ] / [ ][ ]E F OH E F E Fd C dt k OH C r
•
− − −− = =                                      (4.16) 
[ ] / [ ][ ]PE F OH PE F PE Fd C dt k OH C r
•
− − −− = =                                   (4.17) 
 
Where CE-F and CPE-F are the concentration of organic compounds in the electro-Fenton 
and photoelectro-Fenton processes, and the kOH represents the rate constants for the 
reaction between hydroxyl radicals and organic compound. The rations (rPE-F/rE-F) of UVA 
promoting the efficiency on the initial rates of 2,6-DMA were 2.01, 2.56 and 2.66 while the 
initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased from 15 to 20 and 25 mM, 
respectively. It can be concluded that the highest benefit of UVA irradiation was achieved 
at 25 mM of hydrogen peroxide.

4.3. Treatment of BSA and 2,6-DMA by Different Oxidation Processes 
 
According to the summary mentioned above, we know that the double cathode 
electrochemical cell has more potential for the improvement of the efficiency of electricity 
utilization. Therefore, in this part of study, we employed a novel photoelectro-Fenton 
method, in which ferrous ion was regenerated via the reduction of ferric ion by the light 
source and also on the double cathode. Furthermore, the electrolysis, Fenton, 
electro-Fenton and photoelectron-Fenton experiments were conducted to investigate the 
synergistic effect of combined photo and electrochemical methods. 
 
4.3.1. Oxidation of BSA in different processes 
Based on the results of current efficiency and energy consumption, the double cathode 
device (Figure 3.3 (a)) should be used for further oxidation research. Electrolysis, Fenton, 
electro-Fenton and photoelectron-Fenton experiments were conducted to investigate the 
synergistic effect of combined photo and electrochemical methods. Figure 4.13 showed 
that the electrochemical method could only slightly remove COD from the benzene 
sulfonic acid solution. In the electro-Fenton process, COD was removed rapidly during the 
first 20 minutes. The final COD removal efficiency achieved by the electro-Fenton process 
was nearly 17 % higher than that of the Fenton’s reagent alone. Meanwhile, the 
photoelectron-Fenton process achieved a COD removal efficiency that was 14 % higher 
than that of the electro-Fenton process. This indicated that the photoelectro-Fenton method 
had synergistic effect for COD removal. 
 
 78
4.3.2. Mineralization of BSA in different processes 
 To investigate the synergistic effect of combined irradiation, electrochemical method 
and Fenton’s reagent, 720 mg/L TOC of BSA solution was treated with Fenton reagent 
alone, the electro-Fenton method alone and the photoelectro-Fenton method, respectively. 
Figure 4.14 show that the Fenton process could only slightly remove TOC from the BSA 
solution. Furthermore in both the electro-Fenton and the photoelectro-Fenton processes, 
TOC was removed faster during the first hour. After that, only slow changes in TOC were 
observed because ferric ion was complexed by oxidation products such as oxalic acid. The 
degradation of aromatic compounds often leads to the formation of intermediates such as 
glyoxylic, maleic, oxalic, acetic and formic acids (Pignatello et al,. 2006; Sirés et al,. 
2007a). These complexes typically have higher molar absorption coefficients up to 500 nm 
in the near-UV and visible regions leading to the generation of ferrous ion 
(Safarzadeh-Amiri et al., 1996). Meanwhile, the ferrous ion is regenerated via the 
reduction of ferric ion on the cathode. 
The photochemistry of Fe3+ is advantageous to the Fenton process because the 
reduced iron can react with H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radical. The final TOC removal 
efficiency achieved by the electro-Fenton method was 64%, nearly 20% higher than 
Fenton’s reagent alone. Meanwhile the final TOC removal efficiency achieved by the 
photoelectro-Fenton method was 72 %. This indicates that irradiation and electrochemical 
methods had a synergistic effect for TOC removal because the photoelectro-Fenton 
reaction takes advantage of the photo-reduction of Fe(Ⅲ)-oxalate complexes (Pignatello et 
al,. 2006). Bolton and coworkers added oxalate to the reaction solution and observed the 
photoreduction of the resulting ferrioxalate complexes, such as

and obtained degradation of aromatic and chlorinate aromatic hydrocarbons 
(Safarzadeh-Amiri et al., 1996). However, photodecomposition of Fe3+ complexes 
produced some short organic acids, which are produced in the last degradation steps before 
total conversion to CO2 (Brillas et al., 2000). As shown in equation (2.23), this is especially 
relevant with regard to the oxalic acid mineralization. The ferric complexes would be 
reduced to ferrous ion from the photo-reduction and by reduction in the cathode. This 
would induce the Fenton chain reaction efficiently.

4.3.4. Degradation of 2,6-DMA in different processes 
Electrolysis, Fenton, electro-Fenton and photoelectron-Fenton experiments were 
conducted to investigate the synergistic effect of combined photo and electrochemical 
methods. As shown in Figure 4.16, the electrochemical method alone could remove 18% of 
2,6-DMA in 2 hr. In the electrolysis method, 2,6-DMA would be destroyed by reaction 
with adsorbed hydroxyl radical generated at the surface of a high oxygen-overvoltage 
anode from water oxidation (Zhang et al., 2007; Sirés et al., 2007b), according to equation 
(4.1).

• + −→ + +                                                   (4.1) 
The same tendency can be found in the research of Brillas et al (Brillas et al., 1998; Brillas 
et al., 2007). The removal ratio reached 24% with Fenton’s reagent, showing that the 
Fenton process could only remove 2,6-DMA slightly. The main reason is that ferrous ions 
reacted very quickly with hydrogen peroxide to produce some hydroxyl radicals (equation 
(1.1)), and it is a Fe2+/H2O2 reaction (t ≤ 5 minutes). The rate constant of ferrous ions 
reacting with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals is 53 M-1s-1, and the rate 
constant of ferric ions reacting with hydrogen peroxide to form ferrous is 0.01 M-1s-1 
(equation (1.1) and (1.2)) (Pignatello et al., 2006; Walling, 1973). As literature reported 
(Pignatello et al., 2006; Lu et al., 1999), Fe3+ has a lower catalytic activity than Fe2+ and 
may complex with intermediates. It means that the ability of Fenton method without 
electrical or photo reduction to promote the ferrous concentration is too low for generating 
hydroxyl radicals. 
The 75% removal efficiency achieved by the electro-Fenton process was nearly 51%

4.3.7. Summary 
 
This part of study has demonstrated that the performances of the electro-Fenton and 
photoelectro-Fenton methods are significantly superior to the oxidative ability of a Fenton 
process in the degradation of BSA and 2,6-DMA. The same tendency was shown in the 
TOC removal. This indicates that the photoelectro-Fenton method had a synergistic effect 
for mineralization. Oxalic acid, the major intermediate of aromatic compound degradation, 
can complex with ferric ions. The ferric complexes would be reduced to ferrous ion from 
photo-reduction and by reduction in the cathode. This would induce the Fenton chain 
reaction efficiently.

intermediates in the solution, yielding iron complex species which could interfere with the 
electrochemical regeneration of Fe2+. The photo-reactivity of Fe( )Ⅲ -carboxylate or 
Fe( )Ⅲ -polycarboxylate complexes usually leads to decarboxylation of the organic ligand 
(Pignatello et al., 2006). Hence, the photoelectro-Fenton process has significant oxidation 
capacity compared with the Fenton and electro-Fenton processes.

The biodegradability of the solution was also tested in the experiment. BOD5/COD 
and BOD5/TOC ratios were chosen as biodegradability indicators. BOD5/COD ratios are 
plotted in  
Figure 4.20. In the Fenton process, the ratio barely increased in the range of 0.1 to 0.3. 
A BOD/COD ratio of 0.4 is generally considered the cut-off point between biodegradable 
and difficult to biodegrade waste. Domestic wastewater typically has a BOD5/COD ratio of 
between 0.4 and 0.8 (Metcalf and Eddy Inc, 1985).  
For electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes, the ratio of BOD5/COD was 
increased to 0.4 and 1.0, respectively. The same tendency was observed for BOD5/TOC 
ratios for each process.  
Figure 4.21 shows the biodegradability of BOD5/TOC in each process for various 
reaction times. The BOD test measures organic pollutant concentrations indirectly in terms 
of an equivalent oxygen demand by biological oxidation of the organic matter. However, 
not all organic materials are biologically degradable. Conversely, the BOD/TOC (molar 
ratio) evaluation measures the amount of total organic carbon decomposable by 
microorganisms. A high BOD/TOC ratio means a high degree of biodegradation. An 
increase in the BOD5 of a sample due to different treatment would indicate a greater 
amenability to biodegradation. Thus, an increase in the BOD5/TOC ratio after Fenton, 
electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes are indicative of improved 
biodegradability due to an enhancement in the proportion of TOC amenable to biological 
mineralization. The BOD5/TOC ratio could exceed 1.0. This is because the oxygen demand 
by microorganisms not only applies from organic carbon (i.e. nitrification).

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
5.1. Conclusions 
Using the results and discussion in Chapters 4, we can make the following 
conclusions: 
(1) Considering the effects of electrode geometry and different oxidation methods, it 
should be pointed out that the double cathode electrochemical cell has more potential 
for improving the efficiency of electricity utilization. The results also suggest that a 
small electrode distance device can provide more economical operation. 
(2) Considering the effect of different oxidation methods to mineralize BSA, the final 
COD removal efficiency achieved by the photoelectro-Fenton process was 17 % higher 
than that using the Fenton’s reagent alone. The photoelectro-Fenton process achieved a 
COD removal efficiency that was 14 % higher than that of the electro-Fenton process. 
The same trend was shown in the TOC removal. 
(3) In the degradation of 2,6-DMA, the performances of the electro-Fenton and 
photoelectro-Fenton methods are significantly superior to that of the Fenton process. 
The final TOC removal efficiencies were 10%, 15%, 60% and 84% using the 
electrolysis, Fenton, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes, respectively. 
(4) The investigation of E, kobs and rPE-F/rE-F in the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton 
processes show that higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations induce faster 2,6-DMA 
degradation, yet reduce E. This may be due to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of 
hydrogen peroxide. 
(5) The kinetic study of the electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes follows 
pseudo-first-order kinetics. The electro-Fenton oxidation under UVA irradiation 
conditions accelerates degradation faster than does the electro-Fenton method alone.

5.2. Recommendations 
 
The electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes have been demonstrated to be 
effective in degrading organic compounds. Further research can focus on the following 
areas: 
 
(1) To save costs, we suggest that wastewater can be treated with the electro-Fenton or 
photoelectro-Fenton process. Biotreatment can then be used. 
(2) The anion effect of 2,6-DMA and BSA was roughly investigated in this study. The 
effect for oxidation of wastewater should be further studied. 
(3) Based on the data obtained from the study, a pilot reactor can be designed and setup. 
The cost of the electro-Fenton and photoelectro assisted Fenton process can be evaluate 
with the pilot reactor. 
(4) The integral, initial rate and excess methods can be used to determine the kinetics of 
the reaction.

光電系統促進芬頓程序處理高濃度廢液之反應動力與反應槽設計

雙陰極圓筒型之電解氧化處理設備
嘉南藥理科技大學 盧明俊,丁涴屏,黃耀輝
本團隊近年來致力於光電促進芬頓程序的相關發展與研究，發現以光電促進芬
頓程序可有效提高芬頓程序的處理效能。其主要原因為傳統芬頓程序中的亞鐵
在反應進行之初會快速與過氧化氫反應，一方面產生氫氧自由基氧化有機物，
另一方面產生三價鐵離子與氫氧化鐵污泥。當系統中的鐵離子自二價氧化成三
價後，可提供給過氧化氫的催化能力隨即大幅下降，並容易與副產物產生錯合
，惟此類錯合物可接受光與電所提供的電子，再次還原成亞鐵離子供系統循環
使用。是故欲提高氫氧自由基濃度，首先需提高系統中的鐵離子還原速率。
相關文獻指出芳香族類的化合物在經過傳統的芬頓程序氧化後，通常礦化效果
不佳，污染物多半轉而以小分子型態的有機酸存在於系統中。研究發現這些有
機酸多半為草酸及其他少量甲酸及醋酸，三價鐵易與此類副產物發生錯合反應
，而這些錯合物在紫外光至可見光範圍的吸收度很高，故可接受光能量還原成
亞鐵離子再次參與芬頓反應。研究中以電流及長波長紫外光源促進系統中的鐵
還原反應，目標以節省能源為方向進行一系列的電化學反應槽篩選。
有鑑於過去與電解相關的電解槽裝置一般均為單一陰極與陽極相對，可提供的
反應面積受限於陰陽極板相對之處。本研究以單、雙層陰極電解槽與極板間距A new approach of photoelectro assisted Fenton process has been
developed in our laboratory. It is found that the Fenton reaction can
be efficiency enhanced in photoelectro assisted Fenton process since
Fe(Ⅲ) may complex with certain target compounds or byproducts,
especially those acting as ligands, produced by UVA light and
current. The new design of our system came from the concept of
promoting the ferric reduction rate, which can increase the amount of
hydroxyl radicals. The system was developed to increase the working
area and promote the current efficiency. The test of biodegradability
(BOD/COD; BOD/TOC) was used to explore the effect of Fenton, electro-
Fenton and photoelectro assisted Fenton process.The intermediate of
oxidation process was identified and the mechanisms were proposed.顧問服務業
