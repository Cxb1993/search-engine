Proposed Modified Retinex 
The proposed method is to overcome the limitation of the unpleasantness of the 
saturated chromatic component existing in current Retinex approach to accomplish 
the color image enhancement. The flow chart of the method is illustrated as Figure 1.  
There are five main phases in the proposed work. Mainly, these are accomplished in 
the logarithmic intensity based on the Retinex theory over different scales of affecting 
neighbor. Enhancement is applied by modifying luminance histogram to preserve the 
local contrast visibility. The equalized histogram is combined with Retinex ratio. The 
combination is derived and shown to be consistent with the original Retinex theory. 
The flow chart is detailed as follows.

1. Computing Logarithm image and Retinex ratio 
For the original Retinex theory applying to an image, We use a scale adaptive 
window F, where the ratio of the each perceived component R can be obtained as 
(1.1) ( ) ( ){ } ( ) ( ){ }yxIcyxFyxIcyxR iii ,,,log,log,, ∗−=    (1.1) 
where  is a low-pass filter to simulate human perception, with c as the 
adaptive width of the Gaussian curve as in (1.2).

The proposed approach is to modify the result of existing Retinex theory 
[2,3,4,11,12,13], where the Retinex ratio is employed into the approach to compress 
the high dynamic range images to lower the over bright region and raise the darker 
area in the scene locally. For different emphasized region perceived by human, in [4] 
proposed a weighted MSR as,

In (2.3) illustrates that image formation difference is linear proportional to that of 
the object reflectivity. For the non-uniform light source produces unpleasant low 
contrast of the image, the robust image equalization is applied to the light source ‘S’ 
to enhance the contrast as in (2.4) [14].

3. Adaptive light source 
 
   The procedure of the proposed Quartile Sigmoid Function (QSF)[15] is light 
source in Figure 3.1. The methodology is discussed below. 
According to prior researches, sigmoid functions for tone mapping could improve 
lightness contrast and color saturations. The hypothesis of using sigmoid function for 
lightness remapping is based on the phenomenon of simultaneous lightness contrast. 
It is possible to make the dark colors in an image darker and to lighten the light color 
[16]. A discrete cumulative normal function is used to determine optimal contrast 
enhancement function. However, the potential problem is that histograms are not 
guaranteed to form Gaussian shape in many images. 
 The hypothesis that histograms follow normal distribution should be tested before 
estimating the mean and variance, in statistics; quartiles are one of the basic 
information for any population. When the probability distribution is unknown, 
quartiles are better than either mean or variance. Therefore, this study proposes QSF 
to overcome the limitation which histograms should be Gaussian shape. 
QSF is performed as followed. First, calculate histograms for lightness and color 
(RGB).

An image size NxM pixels, mj denotes the number of color value, i of red channel, 
green channel, blue channel respectively. Second, calculate the cumulative 
distribution function (CDF) of combined histogram distribution. The following 
formula is used to determine CDF F(n,j):

Similarly, the point P2(x,y) for the light-color mapping curve is determined in 
following formula:

Fifth, create the mapping look up table according to both dark-color mapping curve 
and light –color mapping curve. If range of histogram is narrow, a simple linear 
intensity re-mapping will be performed.  
  
Adaptive Quartile Sigmoid Function  
 With the above section description, QSF only deals with a topic for contrast 
enhancement of the original image. This study assumed that the original images are at 
normal lightness level. 
In order to keep the lightness level of original images, we must take account of the 
feasibility by taking 50 percentile Q2 as the segmented point. From previous research, 
Braun and Farichile indicated that the 75 percent points of normal lightness-class 
images cumulative lightness histograms occurred at about 50 lightness units [16]. 
Because of performing QSF on RGB domain not lightness, Q2 is set on 50 percentile 
that should be verified. Viewing conditions of displays will influence quality of 
image show. Taking sRGB color space for example, CIE Lab L*=50 transform to 
sRGB is equal to (118,118,118) under D50 illumination. Surprisingly, the RGB color 
values are not 127. This phenomenon is resulted mainly from gamma settings of the 
destination device. Therefore, in this article, adaptive quartile sigmoid function 
quotes from the normal exposure images which have balanced lightness level at about 
50 units, If we want to obtain more contrast images, lower the Q2 on 33.33 percentile 
to light more pixels and to darken less pixels. However, the way to determine Q2 is 
unknown for observes, which should be examined by doing experiments. We 
supposed that 1.3 cumulative probabilities is an important landmark for enhancing 
images. According to previous section described, a new quartile sigmoid function 
operator, QSFO2 is proposed as f0llows: 
(1) Lower quartile Q1 is on 16.67 percentile, 
(2) Median Q2 is on 33.33 percentile, and 
(3) Upper quartile Q3 is on 66.67 percentile. 
 
Similarly, the new P1(x,y) is given by
