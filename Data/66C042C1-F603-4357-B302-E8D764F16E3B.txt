二、 英文摘要 
Cognition and decision plays an important role in social network. However, the precise mathematical 
model of decision and thus applications based on the presence of uncertainty in social network has not been 
satisfactorily established yet. In this paper, we present a probability theoretic framework of information 
fusion and to model the behaviors of human decision in the social network based on the cognition of 
uncertainty. We construct the topology of social network and apply the statistical inference to derive more 
reliable decision making based on the measure of uncertainty. Besides, cognition with uncertain information, 
usually collecting from unreliable agents, is studied in a systematic way. Here arises an issue that intentional 
attack incurs fatal threats on modern networks by paralyzing a small fraction of nodes with highest degrees 
to disrupt the network. Via social networking, distributed decision is proposed as a way to information 
fusion and to better against potential malicious behaviors and enhance the network robustness. By 
formulating the attack and defense strategy as a zero-sum game, we leverage the expected payoff as a 
benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of the fusion-based defense mechanism. Both analytic results and 
empirical data support that fusion-based defense is able to prevent the network from disruption, even under 
poor detection capability and fragile nature of social networks. 
Another issue is the information dynamics in social/complex networks. In this project we demonstrate 
two studies. The first is On modeling malware propagation in generalized social network and the second is 
Information Epidemics in Complex Networks with Opportunistic Links and Dynamic Topology Both studies 
shows that by applying the concept of epidemiology, we are able to study the message behavior on the social 
and communication networks and thus deal with a fatal malware problem on it. This part of research shows 
the potential and importance of the study of information dynamic on social/complex networks.

an observation space is a collection of graph 𝐺 =  (𝐸,𝑉 )with finite vertices and edges. Each vertex in 
observation space corresponding to a observable attributes 𝑋𝑗 and edges to connect those attributes that we 
judge to be directly related. In general, Y = f�𝑋1, … ,𝑋𝑝� but 𝑓(·) may reserve unknown. A sampling 
process 𝐾 ∈ 𝒦 is a relation from state space to observation space. Thus, data is a sampling on the 
observation space. The goal of data processing is to draw any information about 𝒔 based on observing 
�𝑋1, … ,𝑋𝑝�. If we define any format of cost function 𝒞, the data processing is designing the function 
𝑌� = 𝑓(X1, … , Xp) to satisfy 
𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝐾∈𝒦,𝑿∈𝐺𝐸 �𝐶 ��𝐾(𝑌,𝑿),𝑌���� 
where 𝑿 = �𝑋1, … ,𝑋𝑝�. This is a very complicated optimization problem, however, many techniques and 
theory has been developed to be introduced on this report. 
Regarding the issues of information and data processing on social network, many literatures have 
discussed it in variety of views. From social network analysis aspect, most of the discussions are based on 
fundamental knowledge of social network structures [5], [6], [7]. Thus we have the studying of distributed 
search [8], [9], information exchange [10], diffusion of social influence [11] and evolution of social 
networks [12] [13]. Such research focuses on the properties of information and data on the social network 
and derives many features of corresponding behavior models; however, lacking the study of how to 
processing the information and data. Some exactly solvable models of the structure of social networks, 
based on random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions are derived to capture some properties of the 
data in social networks [14]. On the other hand, without the consideration of data collection, we have 
developed statistical inference and signal processing [15], regression analysis [16], and nonlinear data 
structure analysis [17]. These treatment focus on deriving optimal information extraction (i,e, 𝑓(𝑿) and 
seldom reach the topics of data with correlations and high dimensions).

relation of data and interested phenomenon is deterministic. The network based data should also consider it formation and 
contribution to our interested phenomenon.

While developing methodology to network cognitive radios, we may note a few interesting situations 
(see [1]) regarding fundamental theory that motivates this study. First of all, from the networking purpose, 
the CR links are generally opportunistic to be available in probability sense and only in short time duration, 
which prohibits typical bi-directional network operations. The primary difference and thus challenges 
between routing (and other networking functions) of CRN and routing of wireless ad hoc (or sensor) 
networks would be summarized as follows:  
(A)  Link availability: CRN links are available under idle duration of primary system(s) that dynamic 
spectrum access (DSA) can effectively fetch such opportunities, after successful spectrum sensing. 
Consequently, links in CRN, especially those involving CRs as transmitters and/or receivers, are 
stochastically available in general, which gives CRN topology to be random even under all nodes being 
static, not to mention mobile nature of CRN. Although wireless ad hoc networks and sensor networks have 
similar phenomenon, links in CRN can vary much more rapidly as link available duration is only fraction of 
inter-arrival time for traffic and control signaling packets.  That is, link available period in CRN is in the 
range of mil-seconds, instead of seconds, minutes, hours, and even days, like its wireless networking 
counterparts. 
(B)  Unidirectional Links: Typical wireless networks have bi-directional links, as radio communication is 
half-duplex. In typical wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, unidirectional links might be possible due to the 
asymmetric transmission power and/or different interference levels at receivers. We may treat unidirectional 
links to be rare in wireless networking. However, in CRN, unidirectional links are more likely due to the fact 
that a CR node may just have an opportunity to transmit in one time duration and there is no warrantee to 
allow the opportunity for transmission from the other direction. Another possible situation is that a CR node 
wants to leverage an existing PS to (cooperatively) relay packets, however, the other direction might not be 
permitted, and vice versa. Generally speaking, a link involving a CR node is likely uni-directional. It 
distinguishes CRN from other wireless networks, especially for network layer functions.    
(C)  Heterogeneous Wireless Networks: Different from typical wireless ad hoc or sensor networks, CRN is 
generally formed by heterogeneous wireless networks (co-existing primary systems and CR nodes to form 
ad hoc networks). Inter-system handover is usually required for routing in such heterogeneous wireless 
networks. However, CR links might be available for just an extremely short duration and its successful 
networking lies in cooperative relaying among such heterogeneous wireless networks. If we further consider 
network security, to enable CRN for spectrum efficiency of wireless networks at the price of losing security 
might be questionable, as there is not enough time for a CR node to get secure certificate within the short 
opportunistic window. A compromise to operate among heterogeneous wireless networks and CR nodes for 
CRN routing is obviously needed.    
There are some common types of complex networks in real engineering world, though most existing 
research regarding complex network in physics and rare in networking research: Internet, WWW [45], and 
scientific collaboration networks (even Brazilian succor star network). Internet and WWW among the most 
important inventions in 20th century are not difficult to imagine the linkage to complex networks as many 
articles in Science and Nature introducing [18, 20, 28, 29]. The most interesting part is the linkage of 
complex network to nature and human social behaviors. Scientific collaboration can therefore form a 
complex network [46-47]. Looking into literatures, we may observe another interesting issue that social

四、 研究目的 
To realize statistical methodology of human-based communication networks and related theory based 
on it, we first formulate the general information fusion on social networks and related theory developed in 
Part I, and provide an analysis of intentional attack and fusion-based defense strategy in social complex 
networks in Part II. 
 
Part I. 
Social networks have received wide attention in variety of research and applications. In the last decade, 
tremendous growing of Internet applications and services creates a new life style for human being. Many 
popular Internet services, such as Facebook or YouTube, leverage social relationship to achieve great 
success, in which people pay attention to individuals and relations constructing an equivalent network 
structure, which impacts the behaviors and interactions among people, groups, and Internet services [1]. This 
puts the networks, either social in virtual information platform or technology networks among 
communication devices, at the center of our society. Therefore, it is of particular importance to understand 
and reveal under-explored functional and topological interactions between social and technological 
networks.  
Nowadays a major property of technological networks is the existence of information platform on 
which people share and exchange information on it easily (e.g., websites and discussion board on the 
Internet, regular meeting of companies or organizations), and thus produce a large amount of data that needs 
to be processed, delivered, and accessed according to the objectives of application on it. The way these data 
are manipulated by the social networks agents is a fundamental issue. Under this scenario, information 
fusion arises as a response to process data gathered by information platforms and benefits from their 
processing capability for more application based on it. On the social network, information fusion involves 
not only the inference from personal observations but also the decision making given knowing others’ 
decision on the information platform. For example, we often refer others’ judgment or rating on the website 
before starting any transaction with an on-line seller. Such information is a consequence of the interaction 
among agents in social networks, in which the relationship between agents shows great impact on the 
formation of information. Relationship in social network is regarded as social network structure. Many 
works have admitted that the social network structure does impacts the function and behavior of information 
on it, such as information exchange [2] and dynamics [3]. The information on such networks exhibits 
patterns quite different from classical scenario and thus requires more suitable consideration for designing 
criterion for optimal information fusion.  
The main features of information on social networks are displayed as follow: The issue we encounter is 
the rapid growth in dimension and complicatedness of the information resulting from the complexity and 
huge scale of the network, which makes it cumbersome and non-practical to implement deterministic 
topology to satisfy the demand of analysis. However, statistical mechanics provides a statistical view to 
describe the characteristic of network in the fashion of complex network [4] [5]. We also receive great 
success on communication networks with statistical communication theory, thus a statistical approach shall 
be the first concern. Furthermore, the information on the social network is also suffered from not only the 
interference form personal observation but also the possibly deception or wrong interpretation by other 
12 
 
of node quarantine on the network are not visible at node level, each node performs local detection via 
intrusion detection or anomaly detection on suspicious activities [14]–[17] and then feedbacks minimum 
(one-bit) decision to the fusion center due to limited capacity and finite energy constraint. At the network 
level, the fusion center fuses the feedbacks to infer the presence of attack. By evaluating the network 
resilience, the fusion center launches immediate defense reactions if an attack at the network level is 
detected, otherwise it keeps surveillance on the network to mitigate the potential cost from false alarms.  
Since an attacker manages to disrupt the network by sabotaging as many nodes as possible without 
being detected and the defender (fusion-center) aims to target the attack with less feedbacks, we formulate 
the attacker-defender interaction as a two-player, zero-sum game [18] and investigate the expected payoff of 
this game as a benchmark for our proposed fusion-based defense mechanism. Both analytic results and 
empirical data support that fusion-based defense is quite efficacious against intentional attack with complete 
network information, even under poor detection capability of local nodes and fragile nature of complex 
networks.

The popularity of mobile smart phones with richer wireless communication capabilities allows 
extensive social interactions in the following aspects. First, the communication between an individual and 
his friends in personal social network interconnected by call records and contacts is facilitated by portability 
of handset. Second, smart phones equipped with short-range wireless communication (SRWC) technology 
such as WiFi or Bluetooth (BT) realize peer-to-peer communication between individuals in geographic 
14 
 
nature due to fading and dynamic channel access, and dynamic network topology due to mobility and time 
varying. For a more general networking of Internet users as social complex networks, such challenges of 
further importance remain open. A generic and reliable model is therefore required to capture the 
information dissemination dynamics (IDD) of machine-to-machine communications or interactions in 
relation-based social networks. Inspired from epidemiology, we investigate the IDD in well-known complex 
networks by modiﬁed Susceptibl e-Infected (SI) model, which is surprisingly suitable for above multiple 
scenarios. Systematically categorizing such networks and examining conditions to adopt SI model for IDD 
in complex networks, the fundamental properties including mixing type, vertex connectivity and giant 
component size provide valid insights for quantitative analysis. We also investigate the IDD in networks 
with time-varying topology and show that all individuals receive the information in dynamic sense, even if 
the giant component size is not compatible with the number of individuals in static sense. Consequently, we 
successfully establish such an analytical model for characterizing the IDD in complex networks consisting 
of opportunistic links and time-varying topology, feasible for various random wireless networks and social 
networks. 
With the advancement of wireless communication and the Internet, information dissemination plays an 
important rolein large-scale networks consisting of numerous individuals such as machine-to-machine 
communications and relation-based social networks. As a powerful tool for aggregating multiple networks 
of interests into an uniﬁed manner, complex  network [1], [2] has evolved in recent years to model various 
network topologies observed in current networks. For instance, community resembles Erdos-Renyi (ER) 
network, AS-level routers and the World Wide Web resemble power-law distributed networks, wireless 
sensors resemble lattice (regular) networks and relations between acquaintances resemble small-world 
networks. Although various efforts have been done regarding the analysis of information dissemination 
dynamics (IDD) in certain type of network for a particular purpose such as Inﬂuenza, we may unify the IDD 
in different networks with the aid of complex network notions since many networks of interests share 
common features. Moreover, it is still desirable to understand over the topology of a random network 
evolving withtime due to mobility, and opportunistic links (e.g. MANET, CRN and social networks) [3]. It 
still opens to precisely describe the IDD concerning large-scale time-varying network topology. The 
approach of tracking adjacency matrix can perfectly capture the entire network topology but at the cost of 
high computation complexity for time-varying topology, and is hence hardly useful to investigate networks 
with mobility concern. 
To systematically establish a feasible, ﬂexible  and generic model representing the IDD in complex 
networks, we start from examining the fundamental properties of complex networks. Since the mixing type, 
vertex connectivity and giant component size are essential factors contributing to the IDD, based on these 
properties, we provide several deﬁnit ions to categorize complex networks constructed by well-known 
models discussed in Sec. III. By leveraging the taxonomy, we greatly reduce the tremendous efforts for 
specifying every network of interests since the IDD of the same category share similar features. 
In wireless networks without clearly deﬁned infrastructure  or social networks, a message source (a machine 
or a person) originates the information, and its transportation much resembles spread of epidemics. Inspired 
from epidemiology [4], we model the IDD by Susceptible-Infected (SI) model. 
To deal with message dissemination in any form (e.g. data packet, virus, word or the Internet worm), we

五、 研究方法 
Part I. 
A. Basic Assumption and Axioms 
As the origin, belief is the state describing a personal attitude toward a any unknown or obscure 
phenomena. However, in order to convey more accurate information and as a generalized way of 
quantifying uncertainty, it is more desirable to treat the belief as a mathematical reasoning for a particular 
situation. In order to distinguish some important terms, we make following definitions: 
Definition 1. (Event Space) ”Event” means the facts or information we need to make the decision. For 
example, if a user decides a business transaction based on other users’ evaluation in e-commerce, 
opponent’s reputation is the necessary information. We call them the ”event parameter” in brief. Generally, 
a event space is characterized by a set 𝑋 of the alphabet of basic events. These events are identified by an 
index, here typically denoted by 𝑖. 
Thus we define Bel(𝑋𝑖) as the uncertainty about ”the subset 𝑋𝑖 ∈ 𝑋 is true”. With the help of Cox’s 
theorem [4], we know that the mathematical reasoning is isomorphic to probability measure. Thus we have a 
probability space (𝑋,𝒳,𝑃𝑟) corresponding to the event space, where 𝒳 is the 𝜎-algebra generated by 𝑋. 
Thus we obtain the first definition of belief 
Definition 2. (Belief) The belief of a fact 𝐴 is the probability that the fact 𝐴 is true, i.e. Bel(𝐴) =  𝑃𝑟({𝐴 𝑖𝑠 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒})             (1) 
The cognition of belief are always forming by evidence/observation, thus we have following definition of 
observation space and decision space. 
Definition 3. (Observation Space) The observations are composed of physical phenomenon plus 
interference or wrong interpretation from measurement/observation errors. It is also defined by a set 𝑌 
with the relation to the elements in event space 𝑋, i.e., we have a relation function 𝑌 = 𝑓(𝑋, 𝜖) where 𝜖 
implies error term. Such relation is best described in probability theory. 
Definition 4. (Decision Space) The decision of the agent made by inferring the desired event 
parameter from the observations. 
Generally speaking, evidence/observations also hold uncertainty itself. Given such 
evidence/observations, we form the belief in a more complicated way; we define such process as the 
cognition of belief. The basic structure of cognition of belief is most easily described in terms of random 
sets. Let (𝑋,𝒳,𝑃𝑟) be a probability space regarding the event space. Denote the decision space by (𝑍,𝒵) 
being a measurable space, where 𝒵 is the 𝜎-algebra generated by 𝑍. We would like to quantify our 
uncertainty about the statements like ”the subset 𝑍 ∈ 𝒵 contain the true value 𝑧”. The relation between 
𝑋 and 𝑍 is connected by a decision function:𝛿(⋅):𝑋 → 𝒵, which is a mapping form 𝒳 to the nonempty, 
closed subsets of 𝑍. As the fact that belief is the measure of uncertainty, the definition of cognition of belief 
also follows the same concept: 
Definition 5. (Cognised Belief) The cognised belief, Bel(𝐴):𝒵 → [0,1], is the probability that the random 
subset 𝛿(𝑥) is contained in 𝐴, i.e. Bel(𝐴) = 𝑃𝑟({𝑥 ∈ 𝑋; 𝛿(𝑥) ⊂ 𝐴})             (2) 
Therefore we recognize a fact that 
Property 1. Cognition of belief is thus formed as a statistical decision resulting from the measurement of

in descending degree order. Since the cost of quarantine for network robustness is known at the network 
level while the a priori probability of attack is still unknown, a binary hypothesis testing based on minimax 
criterion is employed at the fusion center to minimize the potential cost, where 𝐻𝐶 = 1 if attack occurs in 
the network, otherwise 𝐻𝐶 = 0. The fusion center quarantines the nodes which feedbacks the information 
𝑢𝑖 = 1 when 𝐻𝐶 = 1, or it keeps surveillance for potential attacks. 
D. Network Resilience 
Since a complex network holds certain resilience that the network is still connected in percolation sense 
when some nodes are removed [11], [19], we define the cost at network level to be 
 
where 𝑞 is the fraction of removed nodes and 𝑞𝑐 is the critical point for network breakdown, i.e, the 
network transits from connected phase to disconnected phase at point 𝑞𝑐. Note that the cost of erroneous 
node quarantine is identical to the role of node removal. Let d denote a random variable of the degree in the 
complex network with degree distribution function 𝑃(𝒅). For a power-law distributed network, 
 
and 𝑐 is a normalization coefficient. In [12], via percolation theory the critical point 𝑞𝑐 can be evaluated 
as 
 
where  𝐾� is the cutoff degree after node removal and it can be obtained by solving the following equation 
 
Consequently, the network cost can be realized by analyzing the critical point 𝑞𝑐. 
 
Part III. 
System Model 
The proposed model is originated from the SI model in epidemic theory [10] to measure propagation of 
infections within a population under risk. The communication between a compromised and a 
noncompromised handset is modeled as a contact between an infected individual and a susceptible one, 
where a susceptible node acquires infection and never becomes susceptible again. This is due to the users’ 
lack of concern about the threat of malwares and the limited capability of current antiviral software. The 
population in our model is the total number of nodes 𝑁 in the network which are assumed to be stationary 
and uniformly distributed with node density 𝜌. We assume that all nodes are MMS- and BTenabled to 
maintain the homogeneous mixing property. Denote subpopulation function (𝑡) = 𝐼𝐵𝑇 (𝑡)+𝐼𝑀𝑀𝑆(𝑡) as the 
total number of compromised handsets at time 𝑡, where 𝐼𝐵𝑇 (𝑡) and 𝐼𝑀𝑀𝑆(𝑡) are those that have been 
20 
 
informed rate (infectionrate) λ is equivalent to the probability β transiting to on state independently among 
channels. And the IDD are equivalent to i(t), the fraction of informed vertices with respect to time. The 
following deﬁnitions and lemmas clarify the notions. 
 
Deﬁnition 1. For a communication channel between two vertices at arbitrary time t, a link is present with 
probability β that the information is transmitted from the informed end to 
the susceptible end.  
 
Lemma 1. The graph G(V , L) is a spanning subgraph of G(V, E), where L is the set containing all links at 
arbitrary time t. 
Proof: ∀ e ∈ E, a link l exists with probability β at arbitrary time t. We denote the relation by indicator 
function 1L(e). Since G(V , E ) and G(V, L) has the same vertex set V, and L is a subset of E, G(V, L) is a 
spanning subgraph of G(V, E). 
Because there are only two types of vertices in G(V, E) i.e., the fraction of informed vertices i(t), and 
the fraction of susceptible vertices s(t), we denote i0 the fraction of initially informed vertices, by SI model 
we have  
  
and (1) has analytical solution 
 
From (2) it is clear that i(t) approaches 1 as time evolves. However, conventional SI model is unaware of 
network topology and therefore can be applied only under certain constraints discussed in Sec. III. 
Throughout our work, we assume initially there is only one informed vertex, i.e., i0= 1/N. 
 
Deﬁnition 2. The degree of vertex v of G(V, E) is the number of channels connecting to v, and the degree 
distribution Pk(t) of G(V , E ) is the probability of having k channels for a vertex v ∈ V at arbitrary time t. 
We assume that there is at most one edge between any vertices pair and no self-loops in G(V, E), by 
Deﬁnition 2 it is straightforward that the degree of a vertex is the number of distinct contacts (neighbors) of 
a vertex. For dynamic topology the elements in E vary with time while the dynamic network still maintains 
the basic structure and properties.

property of trust discussed in [13] 
 
B. Cooperative Decision 
In the previous section, we build up a way to select useful comment and evaluate the uncertainty 
toward this comment. In this section, we design the optimum decision rule with cooperative agent’s 
information (side information), that is, we try to detect 1𝑇  based on the knowledge of 1𝐶𝑜. 
Thus, our problem become detecting 1𝑇  without a priori probability and one observation 1𝑇, which is 
the detection result at the previous section. In addition, probability of detection and probability of false 
alarm has been determined. 
Proposition 3. On observing 1𝐶𝑜 = 1, we will choose to trust the target agent as long as 
 
On observing 1𝐶𝑜 = 0, we will choose to trust the target agent as long as 
 
However, this bound is hard to achieve because it is often greater than 1. 
Remark. Assume that the condition in proposition 2 has been already checked 
We applied our algorithm to the data on the website Yahoo!. We find some accounts which may be 
malicious to the consumer and analyze it transaction records. The results (TABLE III) shows that, the 
method of distributed decision tends to be more conservative when evaluate ones trust state. Even Account 
D received high score on the Yahoo! By flooding attack, it is still classified in to not trust-worthy due to its 
malicious behavior. Our proposed algorithm does retain robust performance facing a number of malicious 
users in the e-commerce system on considering consumers cost. 
We apply this algorithm to the data on Yahoo! Auction[22] again. In this simulation, we determine the 
uncertainty by evaluating the cooperative agent’s confidence level first with PF ≤ 0.05, then select its 
comments on our target agents. Finally we determine the trust state with cooperative decision. Table II 
depict the result of our simulation. Based on our algorithm, a surprising fact is that, we omit 50.50% to 57.15% of total number of comments in these four accounts on Yahoo! Auction, even it have received high 
score on this e-commerce system. However, the minimax criterion still shows a conservative attitude toward 
deciding the trust state of target agent.

miss detection (false alarm) at the fusion center. We have 
 
where ⌊η′⌋ is the greatest integer which is smaller or equal to η′ since k is a discrete random variable. 
Let F(k; n, p) denote the cumulation distribution function (CDF) of k ∼ BIN(n; p), we have 
 
where IX(a, b)is the regularized incomplete beta function. With (10), we rewrite (9) as 
 
Consequently, given S and (10), the threshold ⌊η′⌋ can be obtained by solving the following equation 
 
As shown in Fig. 2, the threshold ⌊η′⌋ has a linear scalability with respect to the number of nodes under 
surveillance (S), and higher false alarm probability contributes to larger ⌊η′⌋ in order to minimize the 
potential cost introduced by erroneous node quarantine. A direct observation from Fig. 2 is that higher false 
alarm probability tends to nurture the attacker since the attacker is prone to disrupt the network without 
being detected at the fusion center if the threshold is too high.

for propagating. In this case, the average number of neighbors 𝜂𝐵𝑇 equals 𝜌𝜋𝑅2  . The probability that a 
susceptible node becomes infected after receiving the malware 𝛽𝐵𝑇 depends on probability that it confirms 
and opens the malware. Comparing with MMS with delocalized pattern, the spreading effect via BT 
facilitated by mobility is much small and thus human mobility is ignored in our model. The behavior of such 
spontaneous spreading can be regarded as a ripple centered at the source infected node which grows with 
time [5]. It is approximated into our model by having only the infected nodes that lie on the periphery of an 
infection circle can communicate with the susceptible nodes located at a distance of at most 𝑅𝑐 outside the 
infection circle, and thus have the potential to infect them. In other words, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the spatial 
spreading of the epidemics through BT is only contributed from the wavefronts of infection circles, while 
the infected nodes located in the interior of the infection circles are not engaged in further spatial infections. 
This phenomenon should be carefully modeled otherwise the overestimation problem [3] leads significant 
deviation. Without loss of generality, we assume that a single infection circle is generated at time 𝑟 by a 
point source infected through MMS and kept stretching for 𝑠 time units. Then its incremental spatial 
infection at time 𝑟 + 𝑠 is 
 
where (1/2)𝜂𝐵𝑇 accounts for the fact that for an infected node on a periphery, roughly half of neighbors 
outside the infection circle are susceptible. Under the assumption of uniform distribution for nodes, 𝑐 = 
2𝑅𝑐√𝜌𝜋 is the proportionality constant [5]. The incremental spatial infection at time 𝑡 of all infection circles 
is given by 
 
It means that there are 𝐼′ 𝑀𝑀(𝜏)𝑑𝜏 point sources originated through MMS-infection at time 𝜏 and each 
contributes 𝐺′(𝜏, 𝑡 − 𝜏) incremental spatial infection at time 𝑡.

deﬁne relevant concepts regarding the connecting probability and connection attribute. If the connecting 
probability is equal for every vertex, the network is equally connectible, otherwise it is unequally 
connectible. And If every vertex has a positive probability connecting to some fraction (not all) of vertices in 
the network, the network is partially connectible. 
 
Deﬁnition 5. A network is saturated if the giant component size approaches total number of vertices in the 
network, i.e., G(V, E) is saturated if the giant component G(VGC, EGC) has 
| VGC|≈| V |. Otherwise it is not saturated. 
 
Lemma 2. If a network is denoted as G(V, E), and G(V , E) is a connected graph, then the network is 
saturated. 
It is obvious that G(V, E) is the giant component itself as long as it is a connected graph, and hence from 
Deﬁnition 5 the network is saturated. 
 
A.  Homogeneous Mixing and Partially Connectible (HoMPC) Network 
Because a lattice (regular) network is well structured that every vertex connects to its K nearest 
neighbors, it is a HoMPC network and the degree distribution is simply a Dirac delta function with 
magnitude equals 1 located at degree K. We treat an n-by-n lattice network on a two-dimensional plane 
(square lattice network) as a HoMPC network because the degree of every vertex except the marginal 
vertex is 4, and the number of marginal vertices are negligible as n increases. 
It is quite obvious that static wireless sensor network belongs to this category due to ﬁnite transmiss ion 
range and regular topology. We will investigate its vulnerability of broadcasting protocol in Sec. IV.  
 
B.  Homogeneous Mixing and Equally Connectible (HoMEC) Network 
Erdos-Renyi (ER) model [5] assumes that a edge in G(V, E) is present with probability pER for total of
 N (N− 1)/2 possible edges. The degree distribution of an ER network is a binomial distribution B(N − 1, 
pER). Since we are interested in large-scale networks, when N is relatively large, the degree distribution can 
be express by a Poisson distribution 
 
where 𝑘�𝐸𝑅= N pER. The degree distribution is centered at 𝑘�𝐸𝑅 and a vertex has equal probability pER 
connecting to any other vertices in the network, thus ER network is a HoMEC network. 
 
C.  Homogeneous Mixing and Unequally Connectible (HoMUC) network 
Small-world network generated by Watts-Strogatz (WS) model [6] is constructed from a regular ring 
lattice and randomly rewire each edge of the lattice with probability pWS such that self-connections and 
duplicate edges are excluded. 
The degree distribution of small-world network is 
30 
 
compared with SI model. The results are reasonable since a HoMPC network such as square lattice network 
implicitly indicates that the IDD are limited by its structure and the total susceptible neighboring vertices at 
an arbitrary time t are actually much less than the expected number N i(t)𝑘� , giving rise to the 
“degree-correlated” problem for overestimating susceptible neighbors. 
 
In Fig. 2 we run simulations in ER networks and observe that the IDD are in accordance with SI model. 
The SI model is slightly faster than the simulation curves due to degree-correlation problem. The reason 
why SI model ﬁts the IDD in ER model is that in (3) the parameters N and pER characterize the ER network 
since we have mean degree 𝑘�𝐸𝑅= N pER. And the HoMEC property regards every vertex in the network 
homogeneous or identical so that SI model, a simple ﬁrst -order differential equation, captures the IDD. We 
prove it from (2) by substituting 𝑘�𝐸𝑅= N pER that

where C = λpER. Given total number N and setting C constant, both SI model and simulation results show 
that the IDD are the same for ER networks with different mean degrees shown in Fig. 2.

described in [10]. 
 
Fig. 3.   IDD in scale-free network and small-world networks with N = 2500 and 𝑘�= 10. 
 
In order to bridge the gap between the SI model and the IDD in complex networks, we need to modify 
the SI model so as to ﬁx the degree -correlated problem because SI model implicitly assumes that the 
neighbors of informed vertices are uncorrelated. For HoMEC networks, we provide an intuitive upper bound 
by modifying the SI model and take the degree-correlation into consideration. 
 
Proposition 1. For a saturated and HoMEC network, there exists an upper bound given the informed rate λ 
and mean degree 𝑘�. 
 
Since a HoMEC network can be characterized by its mean degree, and intuitively we know that a 
vertex except the originally informed vertex is informed unless at least one of its neighbors is informed, the 
susceptible neighbors of an informed vertex are actually less than 𝑘�. We hence propose a modiﬁed SI model 
with effective mean degree 𝑘�𝑒𝑓𝑓 that 
 
 
 
where f (t) is a time varying function accounting for the number of informed neighboring vertices in average. 
34 
 
saturated since all vertices eventually receive the information due to change of connectivity. 
 
Proposition 2. A dynamic network is virtually saturated in the sense that the virtual giant component size 
approaches the number of vertices. 
 
To focus on the IDD in dynamic networks, we set the informed rate λ = 1 so that L = E in order to 
justify Proposition 2. We run simulations in networks that are nonsaturated, especially in ER networks and 
square lattice networks since the two networks represent extreme randomness and extreme regularity 
structures, providing us great insights about the impacts of dynamic topology on the IDD. Whereas the giant 
component of HeMUC network such as scale-free network usually exists so that the dynamicHeMUC 
networks are beyond our scope. 
 
In square lattice networks we assume there are initially K degrees for each vertex and we randomly 
remove pLa fraction of edges so that the mean degree 𝑘�𝐿𝑎= KpLa. At each time step, the remaining edges 
rewire while keeping the regular structure. In Fig. 5 we show that the dynamic square lattice network is 
virtually saturated even if pLa is below the critical probability 1/2. We also observe that when pLa= 1/2, the 
giant component size is roughly 20 percent of total vertices for static case, suggesting that the existence of 
giant component is not a sufﬁcient condition for a saturated network. On the other hand, for dynamic case 
the network is virtually saturated as long as pLa is larger than zero. For modiﬁed SI model 
 
 
 
in slotted time period. The discrepancy increases due to the ﬁnite number of vertices (border effect) and 
uncertainty about the number of susceptible vertices at each time step.  
 
The critical mean degree of an ER network is 1since intuitively for HoMEC network a vertex has to 
connect to at least one vertex to form a giant component. In Fig. 6 we observe the same outcomes as Fig. 5 
that a dynamic ER network is virtually saturated but not necessarily saturated, and the SI model failing to 
describe the IDD of nonsaturated static networks ﬁts the IDD of dynamic ER network with proper estimation 
of f (t). The results reveal that a equally connectible network does not guarantee G(V , E ) a connected graph. 
We also point out that lessening the informed rate λ contributes only to longer latency for information 
dissemination. The IDD in these two networks justify Proposition 2. And we conclude 
 
Proposition 3.   The information dissemination dynamics of a dynamic HoMEC or HoMPC network can 
be characterized by modiﬁed SI model. 
 
We note that the tight upper bound f (t) = 1 in static HoMEC network may not hold in dynamic case 
since the neighbors of an informed vertex may all be susceptible vertices due to mobility. 
 
36 
 
Regarding the IDD in both static and dynamic complex networks, there are wide applications 
associated with the propositions. In social network, the rumor spread or propagation of the Internet worm 
within a small-world network is upper-bounded by our model, where the trust of the rumor or the activity of 
the Internet worm relates to the informed rate. In machine-to-machine communications with or without 
mobility support including cognitive radio networks (CRN), MANET, wireless sensor networks (WSN), and 
robotic networks, the informed rate is determined by channel condition and access, capability of devices and 
QoS constraints. And traditional methodology does not conduct such universal study. Leveraging our model, 
we evaluate the performance of epidemic routing via broadcasting in large-scale MANET where each node 
has the same transmission range R and is uniformly and randomly distributed on a D × D square ﬁeld in 
wrap-around condition. The network is thus a dynamic HoMEC network since every mobile node may have 
chances to meet others within a distance R, and the average number of neighbors 𝑘� equals 
𝑁
𝐷2
𝜋𝑅2 for each 
node. By TLW model [12], we set the step length exponent s = 1.5 and pause time exponent ϕ = 1.38, which 
ﬁt the trace-based data of human mobility pattern collected in UCSD and Dartmouth [13]. And we 
incorporate the packet successful transmission rate to informed rate λ. In Fig. 7 we show the MANET is 
nonsaturated at every snapshot but virtually saturated, and our model captures the complicated interactions 
among numerous mobile nodes precisely.

IDD of static andsaturated network. The results and observations serve as the framework for investigating 
the IDD in networks of time-varying topology. We illustrate that a dynamic network is virtually saturated 
and our model characterizes the IDD even if the network is nonsaturated. For the performance evaluation of 
epidemic routing in large-scale MANET simulated by TLW model, our model captures the IDD precisely 
without the knowledge of tine-varying adjacency matrix. We hence successfully devise an analytic model 
suitable for various scenarios, especially for WSN and MANET.
