1. Introduction 
 
The fast advancement of both video coding and networking technologies has made feasible video 
transmission over networks and generated a broad range of applications. However, high quality 
video transfer over the Internet is still a main challenge to video coding because the current Internet 
lacks quality of service (QoS), and can only transfer video to its best effort (BE) when network 
congestion occurs. Once the available bandwidth is not enough and below the target bit rate, the 
video transmission quality is vulnerable to network congestions, which are likely to cause packet 
delay, jitter, and even loss and lead to a great damage to the received video quality. Besides, the 
video transmission quality over wireless networks is also vulnerable to the error-prone and harsh 
wireless environment characterized by limited range, unreliable links, and scarce bandwidth etc.  
   Video streaming is the major form of video over the Internet. In general, the source of video at 
the sender is first encoded into a single bit-stream, and then packetized to transfer over networks, and 
finally decoded at the receiver. To avoid or minimize video quality impairment from network 
congestion, the design goal of a video coder usually aims for a better Rate-Distortion (R-D), which 
means a better video quality given a bit-rate budget, or a lower bit-rate compression capability given 
a minimum requirement on video quality. However, better R-D is usually accompanied by weaker 
error resilience. In other words, R-D is a trade-off of error resilience. This is a common problem that 
single description (streaming) coding (SDC) has to face. As the other extreme, the design goal of 
multiple description (streaming) coding (MDC) aims for better error resilience at the cost of bit-rate 
overhead, i.e. with R-D as a trade-off [1]. MDC can segment the video source into multiple 
descriptions from the temporal, spatial, and/or frequency domains, where the former two emphasize 
more on error resilience, and the latter more on R-D [2]-[4]. Hybrid-domains based MDC methods 
[5], [6] aiming for balancing between error resilience and R-D also exist. In particular, increasing the 
number of video descriptions of temporal-domain MDC (T-MDC) can strengthen its error resilience 
while damaging its R-D. To achieve a good R-D in the scenario of T-MDC, the number of video 
descriptions should be as small as possible. In this context, weak error resilience should be 
compensated by robust error concealment. In terms of the communication model, error resilience is 
a design issue of the encoder at the sender, while error concealment is a matter of the decoder at the 
receiver. In other words, error concealment can be viewed as the final line of defense for video 
quality due to transmission loss. 
   In this research project, we have conducted a study on the overhead issue and developed several 
error concealment techniques for lost video frames in the context of T-MDC. As the extended output 
of this project, we have also studied the QoS networking related issues, including the DiffServ for 
broadband and 802.11e for wireless. The technical details of these can be found in our published 
papers as listed below.   
   The rest of this report is structured as follows. Section 2 gives the basic framework of T-MDC 
coder design. Section 3 overviews the research issues, proposed methods, and summarized results in 
our published papers. Section 4 concludes this report.  
 
 
 
    The price that T-MDC has to pay for its error resilience is the bit rate overhead, which in general 
increases with the number of video descriptions. For instance, compared to the GOP (Group of 
pictures) pattern IBBPBBPBBPBBPBBI... with the period of I frames as 15, it takes only (1I, 4P, 
10B) frames for the first fifteen video frames in the case of SDC, but it needs (4I, 3P, 8B) frames in 
the context of 4-description T-MDC. Hence, it is obvious that the bit-rate overhead comes from the I 
frames. In general, the bit-rate overhead can be formulated in terms of the ratio of the byte-sum 
difference of T-MDC and SDC to the SDC's byte-sum, as shown in (1).

 is the byte-sum of all the J‧N video frames in SDC. 
   The reason why H.264 (also known as MPEG-4 AVC, AVC or MPEG-4 part 10 [7]) was adopted 
in this research is due to its high coding efficiency. The main goal of H.264 is to achieve a great 
enhancement in data compression rate which can present the same quality by less than half the 
bit-rate of MPEG-2. Besides, functionalities such as scalability and multi-view have also been added 
as its extended versions. This will make it easy to upgrade our current research framework for future 
research directions.   
   A good overview and technical evolutions of H.264 can be found in [8]-[12]. H.264 fully 
abandons the object coding concept adopted by MPEG-4, and returns to the rectangular picture and 
slice based coding units. To simplify the design hierarchy of coding algorithms, H.264 consists of 
two layers, i.e. VCL (Video Coding Layer) and NAL (Network Abstraction Layer), where VCL is 
responsible for video source coding engines, and NAL interfaces between VCL and networking 
including streaming packetizing and file formatting. The coding engines of VCL consists of motion 
estimation/compensation, transform coding, prediction coding, deblocking filtering, and entropy 
coding etc. Although not required to be backward compatible, many similarities to the legacy MPEG 
standards remain in H.264. In essence, H.264 does not have a new coding framework or many new 
coding parts, and the overall high coding efficiency enhancement is mainly achieved by cumulative 
optimizations of individual coding engines.

 Design and Implementation of a DiffServ Testbed Using Network Processors 
   This paper presents the design and implementation of a testbed for differentiated service 
(DiffServ) backbone network to realize DS applications, including Expedited Forwarding (EF) for 
real-time/interactive applications and Assured Forwarding (AF) for bulk data transfer applications. 
The testbed system consists of two edge routers and three core routers, and they are all implemented 
on 533 MHz Intel XScale IXP-425 network processor based target boards, empowered by SnapGear 
Linux, with the Netlink kernel framework for highly flexible and advanced traffic engineering. We 
have successfully conducted system tests and data analyses for the testbed system, including the 
functioning tests and performance evaluation of both the DS edge routers and core routers. The 
results show that our DS testbed meets the design goal, and can correctly allocate bandwidth 
resources according to the DS marking and traffic conditioning on ingress packets, and greatly 
improve the latency of EF packets during network congestion. More details of this paper can be 
found in [17].

 An Improved Boosting Algorithm and Its Application to Facial Emotion Recognition 
   This paper develops a regularized discriminant analysis (RDA)-based boosting algorithm, and its 
application of the facial emotion recognition. The RDA-based boosting algorithm uses RDA as a 
learning rule in the boosting algorithm. The RDA combines strengths of linear discriminant analysis 
(LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). It solves small sample size and ill-posed 
problems suffered from QDA and LDA through a regularization technique. Additionally, this study 
uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm to estimate optimal parameters in RDA. In this work, 
the proposed RDA-based boosting is used in the facial emotion recognition, and achieves a good 
performance. In the facial emotion recognition, contourlet features are extracted and followed by an 
entropy criterion to select the informative contourlet features which is a subset of informative and 
non-redundant contourlet features. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed RDA-based 
boosting can accurately and robustly recognize facial emotions. This paper is in collaboration with 
sub-project-2, and more details of this paper can be found in [18].

 A Piecewise Packet Mapping Algorithm for Video Transmission over 802.11e Wireless Networks 
   The 802.11e EDCA can deliver quality of service for video transmission over wireless networks 
during traffic congestions based on the techniques of multiple access category (AC) queues and 
virtual collision, but its performance is limited by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) characteristic of the 
reserved AC_VI queue. In order to offer further service differentiation among video packets based on 
their video frame importance and achieve more enhancement on video transmission quality, this 
paper proposes a novel probabilistic packet mapping algorithm called Piecewise Mapping. 
Depending on the congestion level of AC_VI, the proposed algorithm can actively manage AC_VI 
Media, submitted [21]. (SCI) 
 
 
4. Summary and Outlook 
 
In this report, we have studied and addressed the issues on video transmission quality enhancement 
over heterogeneous networks and terminals. To achieve the project goal, we have implemented an 
H.264 based MDC coder, and addressed the related issues such as bit rate overhead and error 
concealment. 3 conference papers (1 local + 2 EI internationals) along this track have been published, 
and three novel error concealment algorithms have been published, including FB-EC, AVLI, and 
ABDI. In addition, in collaboration with sub-project-2, we have proposed an (RDA)-based boosting 
algorithm for facial emotion recognition, and this study have been published in an EI international 
journal paper.  
   Besides, as the bonus output of this project, we have also studied the QoS networking related 
issues, including the DiffServ for broadband and 802.11e for wireless. For DiffServ, we have 
published 2 conference papers (1 local + 1 EI international), where we have implemented a DiffServ 
testbed using network processors, and we have also proposed a congestion control mechanism called 
RIO-FEC. For wireless QoS, as a bridging study to the following year's NSC project, we have 
published 2 EI international conference papers and submitted 1 SCI international journal paper.             
   The various studies presented in this report have the following application potentials.  
 The proposed error concealment techniques such as AVLI or ABDI can efficiently conceal the 
video transmission errors for the currently best-effort based wired or wireless networks, such as 
the Internet and the conventional 802.11 wireless LAN, and thus should be a good solution for 
the current VoIP and IPTV applications. 
 The proposed QoS networking based error control mechanisms, RIO-FEC, can offer a virtual- 
queue based adaptive control between priority and fairness according to the networking 
congestion level, and thus it should be very useful to enhance the overall QoS of the core 
network engine in the next generation VoIP and IPTV etc. 
 Another direction we are tracking is the perception driven cross-layer design for video over 
wireless, and more specifically the 802.11e based wireless QoS. For this, we have started a few 
prototype studies, and published several novel and improved congestion control mechanisms 
such as the DVFI+DRED cross-layer framework and Piecewise Mapping etc. These will aim for 
more robust video transmission quality over 802.11e ad-hoc networks.
