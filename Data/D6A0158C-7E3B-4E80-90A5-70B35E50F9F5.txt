retrospectively based on the clinical and x-ray angiographic results of patients who received 
carotid artery stenting in the three-year duration. 
Tasks in the three years are already accomplished, which include deduction of EM, NIFA, 
and IFA and the use of Monte Carlo simulation for the derivation of the optimal parameter setting 
of temporal and spatial resolution for each method. Finally, the proposed method was used to 
assess the cerebral perfusion in five normal subjects, ten unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis 
patients, and one patient with the moyamoya disease.

covariance into an identity matrix (Hyvarinen et al., 2001). Subsequently, a fixed-point algorithm 
was applied to search the orthogonal matrix in order to rotate the whitened data so that 
negentropy was maximized, i.e., data distributions for multiple tissues can become as statistically 
independent as possible. However, although one major tissue could be easily identified in each of 
the resulting independent component images, other tissues were inevitably involved in the same 
image, although with lower values of intensity. Accordingly, an additional thresholding method, 
such as that provided by a Bayesian approach (Kao et al., 2003) or by Otsu’s method (Chou et al., 
2007) was needed to discriminate, in a one by one sequence, the target tissue compartment from 
each of the independent component images, starting with artery tissue and proceeding to gray 
matter (GM), white matter (WM), vein and sinus tissues, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
Experience has shown that the segmentation order appears to be straightforward in normal 
subjects, but it becomes more complicated in abnormal subjects since changing the segmentation 
order in normal and abnormal tissue types may influence the results.  
In the EM-MoMG method, the data was similarly zero-mean normalized and reduced by 
PCA. Under the assumptions that the distribution of the reduced data associated with each tissue 
type was multivariate Gaussian distributed and that the overall distribution of the reduced data 
was a MoMG (Bishop, 1995), alternating iterative expectation (E) and maximization (M) steps 
(Dempster et al., 1977) were performed. The E-steps calculated the expected log-likelihood 
conditions using the observed data along with the currently estimated model parameters. The 
M-steps updated the model parameters by maximizing the log-likelihood values. During this EM 
process, the posterior probabilities in relation to each tissue type were obtained at each pixel, 
which in turn provided sufficient statistical validity, i.e., maximal probability, to determine the 
tissue type of each pixel. As a consequence, all tissue compartments could be segmented out 
simultaneously using the EM-MoMG method, instead of the one-by-one segmentation process 
used in the FastICA-based method. However, the EM-MoMG method required an initial guess of 
the model’s parameters to achieve satisfactory results. 
We unify the FastICA-based and EM-MoMG methods by employing hierarchical clustering 
(HC) (Bishop, 1995) of whitened data to provide better model parameter initialization. The 
proposed method is named the HC-EM-MoMG method. The primary differences between 
HC-EM-MoMG and EM-MoMG are that the data are pre-processed by a whitening process, 
rather than only by PCA, and that HC, a multilevel classification method without the need of a 
random initial guess, is applied to the whitened data to segment out each tissue cluster via a 
hierarchical cluster tree, which in turn is based on a minimum variance algorithm, i.e., Ward’s 
method (Wishart, 1969). The HC results were used to initialize the mean vectors, the covariance 
matrices of the MoMG, and the proportions in each class in the subsequent EM estimation. The 
distribution of the whitened data associated with each tissue type is assumed to be a multivariate 
Gaussian function, and the overall distribution of the whitened data is assumed to be a MoMG. 
The HC-EM-MoMG method is similar to the FastICA-based method in that both methods use 
data whitening after zero mean normalization.

(Hyvarinen et al., 2001) from 65 N×  to Nt× . During PCA, at least 99% of the data variance 
was retained.  
Similar to PCA, the data whitening process first calculates eigenvalues and corresponding 
eigenvectors for the covariance matrix of the zero-mean normalized data. The zero-mean data 
were then transformed via a whitening matrix, which was constructed of eigenvectors and 
eigenvalues, so that the covariance matrix became an identity matrix (Hyvarinen et al., 2001). 
The compressed, transformed data resulting from PCA or whitening dimension reductions were 
subsequently used in HC. 
During HC, the compressed data are denoted by a matrix X  with size Nt×  and each 
1×t  column vector in X  is referred to as a feature vector. Initially, HC was carried out in the 
data set X  based on a created cluster tree with a multilevel hierarchy in which any two nearby 
clusters at one level become merged into one cluster at the next higher level. The HC algorithm 
comprised three major parts. First, each group contains a single feature vector of X , i.e., N  
groups in X , and the element in the dissimilarity matrix is the squared Euclidean distance 
between two featured column vectors in X . Second, the two groups that produce the smallest 
increase in the total within-group sum of squares are amalgamated to form a new group. If two 
groups are merged, the dissimilarity between them is defined as the increase in the total sum of 
squares. The algorithm proceeds until all of the feature vectors fall within a single group, thus 
forming a hierarchical clustering tree (Lu et al., 2009). Third, the level or scale of clustering is 
determined by cutting the hierarchical cluster tree. In this paper, we adopted Ward’s hierarchical 
clustering method (Wishart, 1969) for hierarchical tree construction. The HC results for the 
condensed data, X , were used to initialize the mean vectors, the covariance matrices of the 
MoMG, and the proportion of each class for subsequent EM estimation (see Appendix in (Wu et 
al., 2007)). 
Once all tissues of interest were identified, averaged signal-time curves for each tissue type 
were computed and the arterial input function (AIF) was modeled from the averaged 
concentration-time curve of artery in order to compute the rCBV, rCBF, and MTT of each 
segmented tissue types (Ostergaard et al., 1996b; Rempp et al., 1994; Zierler, 1962). 
 
3. Design of hypothetical compartments 
Simulated dynamic images based on a region of interest (ROI) in one of the raw data sets 
were adopted. In those images each simulated data set accommodated the possibilities of having 
four to nine hypothetical clusters (see Fig. 1). Pixels within each hypothetical tissue area were 
assumed to be spatially independent, and pixel intensities across time were assumed to be 
multivariate Gaussian-distributed. The averaged signal-time curves, each of which was a 65 1×  
vector, and the covariance matrices of intensities across time, each of which had a dimension of 
65 65× , within ROIs in the raw data were employed as hypothetical parameters for the MoMG 
model to create sets of noise-free simulated dynamic images using random number generators. In

1741 pixels), white matter (WM, 1636 pixels), vein and sinus (vein+sinus, 610 pixels), sinus (80 
pixels), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and choroid plexus (cp) (CSF+cp, 412 pixels), and artifact (175 
pixels), respectively. 
 
4. Monte Carlo simulations with delay and dispersion 
Delay and dispersion are two popular phenomena in the hemodynamics of subjects with 
cerebrovascular diseases. Thus, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to investigate the 
influences of these two factors on the HC-EM-MoMG method. To simulate the abnormal-subject 
scenario, the concentration-time curves, )(tCtissue , for anomalous tissue types were created using 
the following (Ostergaard et al., 1996b)

in which  tissuedelayt ,  and btissue denote time delays relative to AIF and dispersion, respectively. The 
values of tissueMTT , tissuerCBF ,  tissuedelayt , , and btissue were estimated to simulate the 
concentration-time curves of the delayed/dispersed artery (dartery), delayed/dispersed gray matter 
(dGM), and delayed/dispersed white matter (dWM). Specifically, we calculated the values of 
rCBF and MTT for artery, GM, and WM. The normal rCBF and MTT values of artery, GM, and 
WM were also used for dartery, dGM and dWM, respectively. The derived simulated 
concentration-time curves were then converted into signal-time curves using the following 
)TE*)(exp(*)( 0 tCStS tissue−=  (3) 
where S0 is the baseline signal and TE is echo time. In addition to the signal-time curves for 
dartery, dGM, and dWM, signal-time curves for artery, GM, WM, vein combined with sinus 
(vein+sinus), sinus, as well as for CSF including the corpus plexus (CSF+cp) tissues, which were 
constructed in the section 2.3, were also used in these simulations. Hence, there were 9 
hypothetical tissue types. With tdelay values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 s and dispersion b values of 0, 1, 
2, 3, 4, and 5 s, there were 36 combinations of abnormal conditions that were simulated. In 
 8 
 
corresponding impaired compartments were longer than one second. As examples, the 
classification rates were mostly over 80% when (b, tdelay) = (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), and were over 
85% when (b, tdelay) = (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0). The results also show that as noise increased 
from the noise-free condition to SNR = 40, the mean classification rates also decreased. As 
examples, the mean classification rates decreased from 87.0± 7.94% to 86.6± 6.55% at (b, tdelay) 
= (5, 5), from 87.6± 7.07% to 86.8± 6.01% at (b, tdelay) = (3, 3), and from 83.7± 5.40% to 
80.1± 5.09% at (b, tdelay) = (1, 1). In addition, the mean classification rates obtained from the six 
normal tissues and the three impaired compartments (dartery, dGM, dWM) under different levels 
of delay and dispersion were 4% to 20% lower than the rates from the nine normal tissues shown 
in Table 1. This suggests that some of the perfusion profiles of the impaired compartments may 
be equivocal and more difficult to distinguish. However, with both delay and dispersion times 
longer than one second, the mean classification rate was greater than 85%. 
 The classification rates that were determined using different percentages of abnormal voxels 
are presented in Table 3. In these results, the abnormal percentage was the ratio of the number of 
abnormal voxels to the total number of voxels in a tissue type. The results demonstrate that a 
higher abnormal proportion produces a lower mean classification rate and a larger standard 
deviation. The mean classification rates decreased from 78.2–90.1% with a 13% abnormal 
percentage to 56.3–88.9% with a 50% abnormal percentage. Moreover, the standard deviations 
increased from between ± 2.24% and ± 6.11% with a 13% abnormal percentage to between 
± 2.55% and ± 9.65% with a 50% abnormal percentage.

simulations resulted from the EM-MoMG method initialized by the results of HC on the whitened

artery, GM, WM, vein+sinus, sinus, CSF+cp, CSF, vein with noise, sinus with noise, as well as 
artifacts, were segmented from normal data sets. The ratios of GM to WM for rCBV, rCBF, and 
MTT were 2.196±0.097, 2.259±0.119, and 0.968±0.023, respectively. These ratios were in 
agreement with other published reports (Aronen et al., 1995; Calamante et al., 1999; Wenz et al., 
1996).  
 
3. Results from an internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) subject 
The stenosis subject was a 78 year-old male subject with a right-side ICA 99% stenosis. A 
right-lateral neck angiogram of the subject showed the high-degree stenosis on the right ICA 
(white arrows in Fig. 3(b)). Another cerebral angiogram with an anterior-posterior projection at 
the early arterial phase, and with contrast injection from the aortic arch, was provided to illustrate 
the delayed perfusion on the right ICA. The right hemisphere of the brain exhibited delayed 
circulation (white arrow in Fig. 3(c)). This delayed perfusion was observed on consecutive 
trans-axial DSC-MR images (see Fig. 3(a)). The subject’s right hemisphere (abnormal side; left 
side of the images) had a signal drop and recovery between the 14th and 28th images, whereas the 
left hemisphere (normal side; right side of images) had a signal drop and recovery between the 
12th and 22nd images, i.e., the signal drop occurred 2 s earlier and recovery occurred 6 s earlier on 
the normal side than on the stenosis-affected side. In addition, a trans-axial T2-weighted MR 
image (Fig. 3(d)) and a diffusion-weighted image (Fig. 3(e)) at a similar slice location as the 
DSC-MR image confirmed that there was no evidence of infarct or stroke on the slice. Segmented 
results (Fig. 3(f)) from the DSC-MR image using HC-EM-MoMG shows nine compartments, 
namely artery (red), GM (green), WM (brown), CSF+cp (gray), right ICA stenosis induced 
delayed/dispersed artery (pink), delayed/dispersed GM (yellow), delayed/dispersed WM (light 
brown), vein+sinus (blue), and artifact (dark blue). In Figure 3 (f), it is worth noting that the GM 
and WM component maps cross the midline from the normal side to the stenosis side, especially 
in the anterior and posterior regions. Those results support the clinical findings that the subject’s 
anterior and posterior communicating arteries in the circle of Willis were intact. The averaged 
signal-time curves and corresponding spatial maps (Fig. 3(g) and (f)) demonstrate that tissues 
with similar characteristic perfusion profiles can be grouped by the EM algorithm. The results 
suggest that the impaired parts (dartery, dGM and dWM) can be discerned from their 
contralateral counterparts (artery, GM and WM) by applying the HC-EM-MoMG method. One 
should note that the delayed or dispersed arterial input function (dAIF) obtained from the 
signal-time curve of dartery was used to calculate the rCBF for dGM and dWM for minimizing 
the error induced by the delay and dispersion whereas the AIF obtained from the normal artery 
was used for other normal tissues such as GM, WM, CSF+cp, and vein+sinus. Fig. 3(h)-(j) 
exhibit hemodynamic-parametric maps (rCBV, rCBF and MTT) and the details for each of the 
classified tissue types are given in Table 4. The results show evidence of delay and dispersion in 
the impaired compartments. In particular, the TTP of the dGM (23.31± 2.44 s) was larger than 
that of the normal GM (17.85± 1.23 s), implying that there was delayed perfusion on the stenosis

4. Results from a moyamoya disease subject 
Another case was a 57 year-old female patient with moyamoya disease. She suffered from 
sudden vision loss on her left side for 3 days. Her right cerebral angiogram at the early arterial 
phase with lateral projection showed stenosis of the distal internal carotid artery, proximal 
segments of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (red arrows in Fig. 4(b)). Intracranial 
collateral arteries, so-called moyamoya vessels, are seen in the basal ganglia region (blue arrow 
in Fig. 4(b)). The prominent branches of external carotid artery (arrowheads in Fig. 4(b)) form the 
extracranial collaterals. Another arterial phase angiography taken at 1.5 seconds later than Fig. 
4(b) shows the late arrival blood supply (arrows in Fig. 4(c)) via the collaterals.  Her right 
parietal region is less blood-irrigated (arrowheads in Fig. 4(c)). The full perfusion could be shown 
by the consecutive trans-axial DSC-MRIs (see Fig. 4(a)). In addition, a trans-axial T2-weighted 
MR image shows abnormal high signals in her parietal-occipital region (arrows in Fig. 4(d)) and 
a diffusion-weighted image confirms an acute infarct with diffusion restriction (arrows in Fig. 
4(e)). Segmented results (Fig. 4(f)) from DSC-MRI shows eight hemodynamic components, 
namely artery (red), gray matter (green), white matter (brown), CSF (gray), ischemic or infarct 
area (purple), areas supplied by collateral arteries with risk of infarct (cyan), vein and sinus (blue), 
and artifacts (dark blue). The averaged signal-time curves (Figs. 4(g)) demonstrated that the 
artery arrived earliest with maximum signal drop followed by the GM or vein+sinus, WM or CSF, 
risk of infarct, and infarct. Infarct area, mainly the right parietal-occipital brain, was the last to 
receive blood flow and shows much smaller signal drops compared to other areas. The resulting 
right occipital infarct as seen in Figs. 4(d) and (e) may be explained by the hemodynamic 
aberration shown in the infarct area (purple). Whereas the risk of infarct area presented the 
averaged signal-time curve with delay and dispersion effects compared to that of the GM tissue, 
and the spatial map of the risk of infarct resided near to the infarct area. In addition, using the 
classified regions (Fig. 4(f)) as masks on parametric images (Figs. 4(h)-(j)), the hemodynamic 
parameters, (rCBV, rCBF, MTT), for compartments artery, GM, WM, CSF, infarct, risk of infarct, 
and vein+sinus, can be easily calculated, respectively (see Table 5). The infarct area presented

5. Segmentation results of ten unilateral ICAS subjects pre- and post-stenting 
All of the segmentation results from pre-stenting perfusion images from the 10 subjects 
indicated abnormal dGM components with delayed/dispersed concentration-time curves 
compared with the respective nGM curves; moreover, 9 of the 10 subjects’ results indicated 
abnormal dWM components (see left column in Fig. 5). Post-stenting, only three subjects 
presented dGM components and one presented dWM (see right column in Fig. 5); however, the 
signal-time curves in these subjects had regressed toward their normal counterparts. In the other 
subjects, the dGM or dWM components were diminished after stenting, with their of impaired 
components’ signal-time curves becoming similar to normal curves, indicating good recovery of 
cerebral perfusion.

6. Results of spatial asymmetry comparisons 
Spatial asymmetry ratios of the number of normal tissue voxels on the normal side to the 
number on the stenotic side were used to detect bilateral perfusion asymmetry in three 
cerebrovascular territories. Figure 6 (a)-(c) displays scatter plots for numbers of voxels within the 
nGM component on the normal side versus voxel numbers on the stenotic side under pre- and 
post-stenting conditions for the ACA, MCA, and PCA areas. Similarly, Fig. 6 (d)-(f) displays 
scatter plots for nWM component voxel numbers in the normal side versus those in the stenotic 
side under pre- and post-stenting conditions for the ACA, MCA, and PCA territories. Dashed 
lines with slopes equal to one in the plots represent perfect bilateral symmetry of nGM or nWM 
voxel numbers. Dash-dotted lines above the dashed lines have slopes of two, while the 
dash-dotted lined below the dashed lines have slopes of one-half. In Figure 6, the farther a circle 
mark is away from the dashed line, the more severe is the bilateral abnormality. In unilateral 
ICAS cases with delayed and dispersed cerebral perfusion, the number of nGM or nWM voxels 
on the stenotic side would be less than that on the contralateral normal side, resulting in 
placement of the white circle marks on the left upper side of the dashed line. However, some 
subjects’ exhibited pre-stenting nGM asymmetry in the ACA area (subjects 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 in Fig. 
6(a)) and their white circle marks were close to the diagonal dashed line, implying the existence 
of sufficient collateral circulation through the ACoA. With regard to the PCA area, the placement 
of the white circle marks for subjects 1, 2, 3, and 8 (Fig. 6(c)), i.e., close to the dashed line, may 
indicate the presence of sufficient circulation compensation from the basilar artery (BA) or from 
contralateral blood flow through the PCoA. The post-stenting results, denoted by black circle 
marks, were anticipated to be placed close to the diagonal dashed line as an indication of good 
recovery. However, the post-stenting results of subject 7 in nGM MCA (Fig. 6(b)), nWM ACA 
and MCA (Fig. 6(d)(e)) did not regress to the diagonal dashed line, an indication of the presence 
of a total occlusion of the subject’s MCA. Similar results were observed in subject 8’s nGM MCA 
area (Fig. 6(b)) and the nWM MCA area (Fig. 6(e)). In addition, a few circle marks appeared near 
the origins of the scatter plots because fewer GM or WM voxels in the plotted cerebral vascular 
territory.  
Statistical testing indicated a significant change in nGM asymmetry from pre- to 
post-stenting states in both ACA and MCA territories (both p = 0.002). The statistical results of 
perfusion asymmetry based on paired-sample Wilcoxon sign-rank testing are summarized in 
Table 6. For nWM asymmetry, the placement of the WM voxels in the ACA and MCA changed 
significantly (p = 0.012 and 0.006, respectively). Although the spatial asymmetry pre- and 
post-stenting did not show significant changes in the GM and WM of the PCA area, such 
symmetry is still a useful index for the detection of local abnormalities. For example, the 
post-stenting segmentation results from subject 1 (Fig. 5) showed a dGM component (yellow) in 
the right posterior brain. The presence of the anomaly was discerned by the large asymmetry in 
the PCA area (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 6(c)). In that subject, the number of post-stenting 
nGM voxels in the PCA area was markedly lower than that in the pre-stenting result.

四、結論與建議 
The study combines our previous EM-MoMG and FastICA-based methods for segmenting 
spatial-temporal hemodynamic patterns with the results from HC on whitened data. That 
combination produced a rigorous method of model parameter initialization. Monte Carlo 
simulations were designed and conducted under various levels of noise, delay, and dispersion of 
signal-time curves to assess the performance of the proposed method and to compare it with other 
initialization methods. The results demonstrated that, without delay and dispersion, the 
classification rates obtained from the HC-EM-MoMG method were at least 93.6± 1.42%. The 
method outperformed the other initialization approaches in terms of higher classification rates 
with smaller standard deviations. Moreover, with the inclusion of delay and dispersion, most of 
the HC-EM-MoMG derived classification rates were greater than 80% whenever the differences 
in delay or dispersion between normal and corresponding impaired compartments were longer 
than one second. Analysis of data from an ICA stenosis and moyamoya disease subject illustrated 
the effectiveness of the method for localizing impaired compartments. The method allows 
impaired hemodynamics to be quantified, serving as an aid in diagnosis and therapeutic 
assessment, such as evaluation of the integrity of the circle of Willis and identification of the risk 
of infarct area.

A New Model of Intelligent Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection 
System 
Xuedou Yu 
 
Intrusion detection is a dynamic security protection technology that can detect the 
nternal and external network attacks. Now the shortcomings of the single detection  
ystem are that the false alarm rate and omission rate is relatively high and detection 
efficiency is relatively low. In this paper, a new type of intelligent hybrid detection 
system model is proposed after the comprehensive analysis of the advantages and 
disadvantages of each system, and we introduced several key module design and 
algorithm implementation. The model can be flexibly extended to meet different 
network environment, improve their detection performance and accuracy. 
 
Applying the Dual-tree Complex DWT and Double Density DWT for 
Mass Spectrometry Feature Extraction and Classification 
Phuong Pham, Li Yu, and Minh Nguyen 
 
In this paper, we propose to use dual-tree complex and double density discrete 
wavelet transform for extracting mass spectrometry features. Two corresponding 
procedures are suggested for mass spectrometry classification. Several experiments 
are deployed on two types of MALDI-TOF mass spectra, including stable spectra and 
noisy spectra. The classification results show that our proposed procedures not only 
obtain better performance than previous methods but are robust-to-noise. 
 
An Improved Method for Digital Time Series Signal Generation from 
Scanned ECG Records 
Prachanth Swamym Srinivasan Jayaraman,and M. Girish Chandra 
 
Archiving the paper Electrocardiogram (ECG) trace as an image in hospitals and 
clinics is a regular practice to maintain the patients’ history. However, it requires 
immense storage space and manpower for storage and retrieval of the patient records. 
In this paper we have proposed an improved algorithm for the existing paper ECG 
trace to digital time series with adaptive and iterative image processing techniques. 
We have tested our algorithm with a number of ECG sheets printed from 12-lead 
ECG equipments. Further, the proposed technique is enhanced to calculate the heart 
IDE. It is created as a Java applet and it can be used via an Internet browser anywhere 
in the world. The software can be found at the following

A Storage and Search Efficient Representation of Medical Data 
Razan Paul, and Abu Sayed Md. Latiful Hoque 
 
Integrating Large-scale medical data is important to support healthcare research. 
Medical data have a number of unique characteristics like data sparseness, high 
dimensionality and rapidly changing set of attributes. To handle the above challenges 
of medical data, Entity Attribute Value (EAV) is the widely used solution. However, 
EAV suffers from higher storage requirement and not search efficient. In this paper, 
we have proposed a storage & search efficient data model: Optimized 
Column-Oriented Model (OCOM) for the physical representation of Medical data as 
an alternative of widely used EAV. This model optimizes basic Column- Oriented 
model. We have demonstrated its effectiveness by testing it in a medical 
data-warehousing environment.  
 
Growth, Radiation Use Efficiency and Yield Parameters of Wheat 
Affected by Differenct Levels of Irrigation and Nitrogen 
Muhammad Asif, Amjed Ali, Muhammad Maqsood, and Shahbaz Ahmad 
 
A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of different levels of irrigation 
and nitrogen on growth and radiation use efficiency of wheat crop. The results 
exhibited that the Crop growth rate (g m-2d-1), Leaf area index, Leaf area Duration 
(days),Number of fertile tiller unit-1 area, Number of grains spike-1and Harvest 
index( % )were significantly increased by increasing the number of irrigation and 
nitrogen levels. Among irrigation levels, highest value (37.34) for harvest index was 
achieved in treatment I4 (irrigation at tillering + booting +anthesis + milking + dough) 
and the highest value for harvest index (36.35) was recorded for treatment N2 (150 kg 
N ha-1). This was formed the best combination for having maximum harvest index of 
the variety SH-2002.

We described a combined multiple clustering approach to automatically identify 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia neoplastic population by flow cytometry 
immunophenotyping. Flow cytometry data from various specimens were preprocessed 
by data cross-linking and subset selection before undergoing subspace and consensus 
clustering. This approach was implemented as a Server-side application, with results 
comparable to those performed by manual gating on commercial software. 
 
Survival and Physiological Responses of Vibrio Parahaemolyticus to 
Starvation in Warm Seawater 
Qing-pi Yan, and Ying-xue Qin 
 
Log-phase cells of pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus were incubated in warm 
seawater for starvation studies. The results showed that: the number of total bacteria, 
viable bacteria and culturable bacteria of V. parahaemolyticus all increased 
remarkably at the initial starvation stage; after reaching theirs peak at 15 d, both total 
bacterial number and viable bacterial number of V. parahaemolyticus fell slowly, 
while the CFU number fell more quickly after reaching its peak at 10 d; starved cells 
shrunk their volumes and turned their shapes into ovals from short rods; starved cells 
showed more sensitivity to heat and UV; there was no significant difference in the 
lowest detection limit between starved cells and log-phase ones determined by ELISA; 
starved cells exhibited a sharply decline in the adherence to skin mucus of large 
yellow croaker and no specific adhesion was found after starved for 7 d and more; 
starved cells were less virulent to mouse; the cellular protein of V. parahaemolyticus 
decreased remarkably at the initial stage of starvation and increased a little at the latter 
stage. The results indicated that: pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus might survive 
starvation for a long time in the warm seawater profit from the morphological and 
physiological changes; the starved cells were less virulent and more sensitive to 
environmental stresses. 
 
Limiting Search Space in Bayesian Network using GGM 
Qing Zhang, and Samuel SM Sun 
 
In this paper, we describe a modified greedy search method for selecting the highest 
Bayesian score. Particularly, our method uses GGM to limit the searching space based 
on the partial correlation value. We demonstrate that our method achieved comparable 
results with classical method and saved ~50% of computational time. The modified 
greedy search method can be widely used for efficient network inference in systems 
Proposed herewith is a model of life expectancy, using empirical analysis, of weight 
respiration rate, heart rate, & blood pressure for human beings.. The model variants 
suggest robustly that proxy for technology, education, and healthcare all have a 
significant and positive effect on average life expectancy. This analysis provides 
information of use to governments & insurance companies particularly in the 
developing world, since average life expectancy is predicted by variables that can be 
easily measured.

decreased connectivity was revealed in occipital lobe, 
parietal-occipital, and frontal-occipital regions. Our findings 
suggested that the functional brain network affected by 
MDD comprised not only the frontal and limbic regions but 
also the parts of the parietal and occipital lobe.  
II. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. Subjects 
The study included 20 patients with major depression 
disorder (age, 23-48 years; 7 males) who were recruited 
from Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Confirmation of the 
diagnosis for all patients was made by clinical psychiatrists, 
using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM). The symptoms of these patients were 
assessed using the following rating scale: Hamilton Rating 
Scale for Depression (HAMD), which is used to assess the 
severity of depression in patients already diagnosed with an 
affective disorder and is more sensitive to the changes 
brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment. 
The treatment were mainly Bupropion, Zolpidem, and 
Clonazepam (1 subject was not receiving any medical 
treatment at the time of examination) in MDD group. All the 
22 healthy subjects had no history of psychiatric illness. All 
subjects gave voluntary and informed consent according to 
the standards set by Taipei Veterans General Hospital. 
B. Data acquisition and preprocessing 
Imaging was performed on a 3.0-T Bruker Med-Spec 
S300 system (Bruker, Kalsrube, Germany) in Taipei 
Veterans General Hospital. Blood oxygenation level 
dependent (BOLD) images of the whole brain using an echo 
planar imaging (EPI) sequence were acquired in 20 axial 
slices. We acquired 200 volumes with the following 
parameters: slice thickness, 5 mm; interslice gap, 1 mm; 
repetition time (TR), 2006 ms; echo time (TE), 50 ms; flip 
angle, 90°; field of view (FOV), 23cm; matrix size, 64×64. 
Each subject was scanned on a single occasion, lying quietly 
at rest with eyes closed for about 400 seconds. Structural 
images were obtained using a rapid acquisition gradient echo 
3D T1-weighted sequence for each subject (TR=2045ms, 
TE=9.6ms, flip angle=90 ° , FOV=24cm, matrix 
size=256×256×128).  
All the preprocessing was carried out using statistical 
parametric mapping (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). The 
200 volumes were first corrected for the acquisition time 
delay among different slices followed by the realignment to 
the first volume for head-motion correction. All the EPI 
images were registered to the corresponding anatomy T1 
weighting images and spatially normalized to the T1 
template image. 
C.  Anatomy parcellation 
The registered fMRI data were segmented into 90 
regions which were previously defined by Tzourio-Mazoyer 
et al. [11] (45 for each hemisphere, Table1) using the 
individual brain atlases using statistical parametric mapping 
software (http://www.thomaskoenig.ch/Lester/ibaspm.htm). 
The representative time series of each individual region was 
obtained by averaging the fMRI time series over all voxels 
in this region. Each regional mean time series was further
