Abstract 
Part I 
 Ag and In-doped ZnS thin films were prepared by direct current and radio frequency 
reactive co-sputtering of a zinc target and an indium target covered by Ag wires in gas mixtures 
of argon and hydrogen sulfide. The influences of the various deposition parameters on the 
structural, optical and electrical performances of thin films as visible-light-active photoelectrodes 
have been investigated. The X-ray diffraction data revealed that the polycrystalline (Ag, In, Zn)S 
thin films contain mixed structures of AgIn5S8 and ZnS. The images from an atomic force 
microscopy showed that the surface roughness was significantly increased with incremental 
increases of plasma power, resulting in increases of the refractive index and the reduction in 
photocurrent. The film deposited in the optimal deposition parameters, DC and RF powers at 50 
 III 
mA/cm2 at an external potential of -1.5 V was obtained for the Ni concentration at x = 0.005.

Part II 
Materials 
Analytical grade of silver nitrate (AgNO3), indium nitrate (In(NO3)3·5H2O), thioacetamide 
(CH3CSNH2, TAA), triethanolamine (C6H15NO3, TEA) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) with 
the purity better than 99% were purchased from Merck Co. and Simga–Aldrich Co. Sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) and acetone ((CH3)2CO) with the purity better than 96% were purchased from Merck Co. 
No further purification of these chemicals was made. Aqueous cationic and anionic solutions 
were prepared separately before the growth of films. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass 
substrates were carefully cleaned ultrasonically in acetone, deionized water and ethanol 
subsequently for 30 min each. Finally, the ITO-coated glass substrates werewashed carefully 
using deionizedwater and blown dry with ultra-pure nitrogen gas. 
Fabrication of AgIn5S8 films 
In this study, the same concentration (0.4 M) of solutions for AgNO3 and In(NO3) 3 were 
mixed together in appropriate volumes to obtain Ag:In molar ratio as 1:1. The concentration of 
triethanolamine solution kept at 7.4M with appropriate volumes was mixed with the solution 
containing Ag+ and In3+ to form the silver and indium complex agents (solution A). Sulfuric 
acid with appropriate volumes was used to adjust the pH value of solutionAin the acidic 
conditions. The concentration of thioacetamide solution was kept at 0.4M to provide S2− for film 
deposition (solution B). Then, desired amount of thioacetamide solutionwas added into the 
solutionAfor the growth of the films. The details of the deposition parameters are given in Table 
1. Pre-clean ITO-coated glass substrates were placed vertically into the beaker containing the 
reaction solution. The reaction solution was put on a hot plate with magnetic stirring. In order to 
increase the reaction rate, the temperature of solutionwas kept at 80 ℃. A brownish colored 
homogeneous layer was obtained on the ITO-coated substrate. In order to increase the film 
thickness, multiple dipping was carried out in a freshly prepared solution bath after a period of 30 
min. The films were annealed for 1 h in tube furnace purged with Ar gas at temperatures from 
500 to 600 ℃ after final deposition.

“Preparation of visible-light-active Ag and In-doped ZnS thin film photoelectrodes by reactive 
magnetron co-sputtering”, Thin Solid Films, Proofs of TSF_22940 (in press). (SCI, Impact Factor: 
1.569) 
The structural, electrical and optical properties of Ag and In-doped ZnS films deposited on 
ITO glass substrate at 300 ℃ by DC-RF magnetron co-sputtering were investigated to explore the 
possibility of producing visible-light-active photoelectrode used in photoelectrochemical systems 
for photoelectrolysis of water to hydrogen. XRD, XPS, AFM and SEM results showed that Ag 
and In-doped ZnS films are composed of well mixed polycrystalline structures of AgIn5S8 and 
ZnS and that an increase in DC plasma power (from 50 to 60 W) has resulted in the surface 
morphology changing from grains to lamellae, leading to an increase of surface roughness. The 
results of the study indicate that the DC plasma power has an apparent effect on the surface 
morphology, roughness, refractive index, and photocurrent of the films. DC and RF powers of 50 
W and a hydrogen sulfide ratio of 0.40 were found to be the optimum deposition conditions. The 
quantum efficiency of thin film was found to be 3.4 % at 420 nm and the highest photocurrent 
density, 12.96 mA/cm2, was obtained under AM 1.5 conditions at +1.00 V vs. Ag/AgCl, with the 
band-gap energy, 2.39 eV, and the flat-band potential, -0.68 V vs. NHE. For such band-gap 
energy and sufficient negative flat-band potential, the thin film made at optimum deposition 
conditions is suitable for use as an efficient photoelectrode used for production of hydrogen by 
solar light. 
From the optical measurements, the thickness, refractive index, extinction coefficient, and 
absorption coefficient of the films can be calculated numerically using the formula given below .

where n0 is the refractive index of air (=1), ns is the refractive index of ITO substrate, n and k are 
the refractive index and extinction coefficient of the film at wavelength λ, d is the film thickness. 
Generally, n and k are wavelength-dependent parameters, and different dispersion equations for 
n(l) and k(l) have been proposed to characterize the film. For example, Forouhi and Bloomer  
proposed the dispersion equations for n and k based on a completely quantum mechanical 
approach to interband electronic transitions with Kramers- Kronig analysis. The Forouhi and 
Bloomer equations, valid for the spectral ranges both below and above the band-gap, for the 
refractive index and the extinction coefficients are given as:

“Preparation of AgIn5S8 Polycrystalline Film Photoelectrodes Using Chemical Bath Deposition 
for Photoelectrochemical Reactions”, J. Photoch. Photobio. A: Chem., 190 (2007) 77–87. (SCI, 
Impact Factor: 2.235) 
 The AgIn5S8 polycrystalline films were deposited on indium tin oxide coating glass 
substrates by using chemical bath deposition. New procedures for the growth of films are 
presented. The solutions containing silver nitrate, indium nitrate, triethanolamin, ammonium 
nitrate, and thioacetamide (TAA) with pH values less than 7 were used for the growth of AgIn5S8 
polycrystalline films in this study. The decomposition of TAA provides S2- :

The influences of various deposition parameters on structural, optical, electrical 
performances of films have been investigated. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction demonstrates 
the presence of AgIn5S8/AgInS2/In2S3 compounds in these films. The X-ray diffraction patterns 
show AgIn5S8 phase is the major crystal structure. With different substrates, the different crystal 
structures were obtained in the films. The band gaps and carrier densities of these samples 
determined from transmittance spectra and electrochemical analysis are lied in the range of 1.87 
~ 1.72 eV, and 4.03×1014 ~ 6.36×1014 cm-3, respectively. The flat band potentials of these samples 
are lied between -0.203 ~ -0.403 V versus normal hydrogen electrode with the Mott-Schottky 
measurements. The maximum photocurrent density of samples prepared in this study was found 
to be 6.5 mA/cm2 under the illumination with an AM 1.5 solar simulator.
