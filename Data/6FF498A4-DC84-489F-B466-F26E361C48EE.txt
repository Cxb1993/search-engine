英文摘要
Apparel industry is a labor intensive industry. The nature of this
industry causes the movement of it’s mass production from developed country
to cheaper labor cost countries or areas irreversible. While most of
traditional apparel manufactures of Taiwan move oversea or seeking for
international sourcing, the lady’s underwear industry, especially
foundation garment or shapewear industry keeps blooming. The same trend
occurs in other developed countries, such as USA and Japan.
As new fibers and fabrics continuous be developed, demand of foundation
garment which combines fashion, comfort, and shape figure function grows
tremendously. The actual shape function, positive and side effects on
skeletal muscle, skin, and movement ability, need to be evaluated
scientifically. The purposes of this research focus on evaluation of
characteristics of elastic fabrics related to physical and comfort
properties, construction design of foundation garment and fabric type are
factors of a 2×2 factor experimental design. pressure measurement,
electromyogram, and movement ability measurement are the dependent
variables.
Key words：Foundation garment, comfort, factor experimental design,
clothing pressure measurement, Electromyogram.
2. EXPERIMENT
2.1 Experimental Materials
Two elastic knitting fabrics for foundation garments are used in this study. The specifications of these two fabrics are
showed as Table 1. The knitting fabrics are made of Nylon and Spandex folded yarns. The counts of Spandex yarns are
exactly the same, but counts for Nylon yarns are different. The structure of fabric #1 is Raschel net, and Raschel lace
with floral pattern structure for Fabric #2.
Table1. Fabric Specifications
Knitting is the process of constructing fabric with one or more groups of yarns by a system of interloping loops of
the yarns. The loop structure cause knitting fabric more elastic than weaving fabrics. There are two basic types of
knitting, weft and warp. Warp knitting constructs the fabric by making yarn loops parallel to the fabric lengths and
made only in flat form. The major types of structures in knitted fabrics used for garment and allied products are single
warp tricot, double warp tricot, Milanese, Raschel, and simplex.
Nowadays, net fabrics are almost always made on Raschel machine[1]. It is a combination of pillar (chain) and
tricot (plain) stitches. Raschel lace fabrics are often made on a base of net fabric with a pattern formed from inlay yarns.
They are used for foundation and lingerie, bridal and formal wear, and as trimmings.
2.2Construction Design of Foundation garments
In order to shape figure more tightly, flexible stainless strips were applied on lower back of shape-wear garments.
There are two construction designs were used in this 2X2 factorial design.
One design with flexible stainless strips on lower back of foundation garment, the other design without
These stainless strips, as showed on Figure 1.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
For garment fabrics, the quality is largely determined by their performance in garments; comfort, drape, protection, etc.
Air permeability, water vapor resistance, and moisture transmission are measurements of comfort properties of selected
elastic fabrics made of foundation garments.
3.1 Air permeability
Air Permeability is the rate of air through the fabric at a given pressure [2]. The resistance to air passage increases with
increase in pick and end count , Clayton’s findings which show that permeability increases with decrease in filing yarn 
weight [3].
Two tailed t-test was used to analyze the fabric specification effect on this property. The calculated t value is
-19.1129, which would lead to reject Ho: Two fabrics have the same air permeability. Result showed that fabric #2
poses higher air permeability than fabric #1, due to it is made of finer yarns.
3.2 Thermal properties
Thermal conductivity is the rate at which heat passes through a given area of fabric.
Research reports indicate that this rate varies with fabric thickness and not with fabric density or weight. Low thermal
conductivity is desirable, for clothing designed to keep outside heat from reaching the body. High thermal conductivity
is desirable for clothing designed to transmit body heat to the atmosphere. Hence, in environments where the average
temperature is over normal body temperature, thin open fabrics with low thermal conductivity should be used if one
desire to prevent the body temperature from rising when there is little or moderate activity. When surrounding
temperature is approximately between 70℉ to 95℉, fabrics with high thermal conductivity are desirable if the wearer
is active.
3.3.1 Moisture transmission
Moisture transmission is the rate, with which moisture travels throughout the fabric,
when water contacts the fabric without an impact force, gravity or otherwise. CNS 12222 L3223 A-1 test was used to

1. Air Permeability of selected fabrics showed significant difference, due to different yarn counts and fabric structure.
2. The same content of selected fabrics canses their moisture transmission capability almost the same.
3. Construction effect is significant on functional capability.
4. Foundation garments showed very little limitation on mobility, no matter with or without flexible stainless strips.
