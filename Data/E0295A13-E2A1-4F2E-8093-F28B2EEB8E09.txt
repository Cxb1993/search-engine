Abstract 
In recent years the environment hormone has become the important environment subject. 
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) was one kind of Environmental Hormones which was 
constantly respected. The soil is PAHs stores up the storehouse importantly, a lot of researches 
indicated that organic matter was an important factor influenced the PAHs moving in soil. The 
farmer often employs the chemical fertilizer or the organic fertilizer increases the soil fertility. 
This behavior besides provides the soil ulmin also direct or indirect change soil pH.  The influence 
of PAHs moveing in soil was more concerned under organic matter and pH co-effected. In this 
study, As supply take alluvial soils and red soils was used for experiment which are the main 
category soil for farming in Taiwan,  the quartz sand take the control group, and Pyrene was spiked 
into soils to simulate the contaminated soils. In order to know the Pyrene leaching situation under 
different soil pH level and organic matter content management, the batch experiments were 
examined. The batch experiments were examined. Results showed that under original pH level the 
main factor affected the Pyrene leaching of contaminated soils was the original soil organic matter 
content. In the experiment, added organic fertilizer or rice straw ash into soil both decreased the 
Pyrene recovery efficiency, and the soil organic content (SOC) after added fertilizer or ash had a 
negative correlation with Pyrene recovery efficiency. The decrease of recovery efficiency under 
the same SOC has an order quartz sands > red soils > alluvial soils. Moreover, rice straw ash has a 
higher capacity to fix Pyrene than organic fertilizer, adding rice straw ash into soils could provide 
1% organic carbon and decreased the Pyrene recovery efficiency of quartz sands, alluvial soils and 
red soils 43%, 31% and 33% separately. Increasing alluvial soils organic carbon content to 1.35%, 
after 30 days fixed pH level processes, the recovery efficiency under acidity condition was higher 
than alkalinity condition. Increasing the red soils organic carbon content to 1.0%, the recovery 
efficiency under acidity state significant higher than none treated and fixed to alkalinity treatment, 
and it was no significant difference between none treated and fixed to alkalinity treatment. 
Keywords: Pyrene, organic fertilizer, rice straw ash, soil pH, organic carbon
