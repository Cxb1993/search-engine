研究計畫中文摘要
近年來由於國際上生醫科技產業的快速發展以及國防工業的需求，使得 2 微米（m）以
上的近紅外線範圍長波長光源與光檢測器的發展更突顯出其重要性。舉例來說，許多生醫研
究上的重要分子結構以及大氣中常見的污染源在 2 m 以上近紅外區域都有清晰可辨識的吸
收頻譜。近紅外線的光源與光檢測器的發展，對於其測定有極大助益。現今多數醫院以及醫
學研究單位在測定人體血糖濃度時，多採用入侵式（打針抽血）的方式，即必須藉由破壞人
體表皮取得血液樣本。由於血糖在波長 2.3 到 2.5 m 的紅外線有最強的吸收強度，且血糖含
量與此波段紅外線被吸收的光強度成正比。我們可用一個鹵素燈或汞燈照射人體的皮膚，而
這鹵素燈或汞燈發出的光線含有 2.3 到 2.5 m，經照射穿透人體的皮膚後，此波段紅外線將
會被血糖吸收。我們可由光檢測器測量此波段紅外線照射前後的強度差值，而作為得知檢測
血液中的血糖含量。我們可藉由此光檢測器位於近紅外線的長波長 GaInAsSb 與 InGaAs 材料
來製作光檢測器，免去入侵式（免抽血）的採樣方式，對於糖尿病等需要長期監控血糖濃度
的患者實為一大福音。另外，GaInAsSb 與 InGaAs 近紅外光檢測器另一重要用途為影像測定，
此技術可運用於夜視、成像等，對於國防科技工業發展、民間保全以及夜間影像蒐證等都有
很大的助益。

研究計畫英文摘要
There has been much interest in the 2.0–2.5 m detectors because of the highly demand in
biological and military applications in recent years. Many biological molecules and atmospheric
pollutants have distinctive absorption lines in the near and near-infrared part of the spectrum. For
example, a commercial application is the noninvasive monitoring of glucose levels in the bloods.
The optical absorption spectrum from 2.0–2.5m is correlated with the blood glucose level so that
a continuous measurement of the absorption spectrum gives a continuous measure of the glucose
4A. Zn Diffusion and Optimized Parameters
Recently, antimony-containing materials have attracted much interest for optoelectronic devices in near-
and mid-infrared wavelength ranges (1.2-4.3μm) applications [1]. Ternary and quaternary antimonide alloys
are lattice matched to GaSb and InAs substrates in a wide range of band gap for the high-performance
photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and laser diodes.
GaSb-based photodetectors are widely used in many applications, such as detecting the atmospheric
pollutants and monitoring the glucose levels in the human blood [2]. The most common low-cost technique
for planar junction formation in InGaAs/InAsP PD manufacturing is the sealed-ampoule Zn-diffusion
technique. This process seals the patterned InP wafers under vacuum inside a quartz ampoule, along with
some dopant source and a decomposition suppressant. The junction pattern is typically etched through a
silicon-dioxide or silicon-nitride mask. The dopant source for p-n junction formation is usually solid-phase
zinc, although cadmium also has been used. Zinc and cadmium are p-type dopants, so the InP-based
semiconductor material must be n-type for a diode junction to be formed. This type of diffusion is not realistic
for InP-based material systems because the temperature requirement far exceeds the decomposition
temperature even when a Group-V decomposition suppressant is used.
A relatively new technique for junction formation, at least within the InGaAs/InAsP material system, is
spin-on diffusion (SOD) [3]-[6], a process that has been available for many years for silicon and is still used
in some low-cost silicon processes. These days, though, ion implantation and carrier-gas diffusion dominate
most silicon production, and spin-on-glass (SOG) doping for silicon has mostly been relegated to
undergraduate electronics laboratories because of its relative simplicity and low cost. These same features
make the process attractive for fabrication of InP-based diodes. SOG is a type of glass that can be applied as a
liquid and cured to form a layer of glass having characteristics similar to those of SiO2. In general, SOG is
mainly used for planarization and as a dielectric material. The process sequence of spin-on diffusion is
outlined as below:
1. Silicon nitride diffusion-mask deposition and shallow delineation etching.
2. Application of source on top of silicon nitride layer with open diffusion windows by spin coating of an
InP substrate and soft bake on hotplate.
3. Deposition of 1500 Å thick cap layer of silicon nitride.
4. Drive-in process with application of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 550C
5. Removal of excess glass and silicon nitride films in HF: H2O.
6. Deposition of silicon nitride, followed by lithography and etching steps.
7.
In this work, we report the high-performance GaSb and InGaAs photodiodes diffused by Zn in 1-mm
diameter.A 3000Å thick SiO2 film and a 1500Å SiNx film were deposited on the n-type GaSb wafer by
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). A 1-mm-in-diameter window was first defined by
photolithography and then etched by reactive ion etching (RIE). The diffusion window was dipped into
HCl:H2O solution to remove surface oxide, which can reduce the dark current. The wafer was loaded into a N2
atmosphere environment and heated at 550 ℃ for 15 hrs.
After diffusion, the wafer was soaked in the 4H2O:(NH4)2S solution at 50 ℃ for 40 min. Then a SiNx
layer was deposited by PECVD. A ring-shaped Cr-AuZn-Au p-contact was deposited by E-gun. The SiNx

diffused at 550℃ for 15 hrs.
Fig. 5 shows the responsivity at 300 K and -0.5 V of a GaSb photodiode. The spectral response ranges
from 0.7 to 1.8 μm. The GaSb has a band gap of 0.7 eV, thus the absorption-edge wavelength is corresponding
to about 1.77 μ which coincides with the measured spectral range.

voltageof AlGaSb/GaSb/GaInAsSb PDs.
Figure 8 shows the current under dark and illuminated conditions and junction capacitance as a function of
reverse bias voltage for the AlGaSb/GaSb/GaInAsSb PDs. The degradation of the dark current with reverse
bias voltage may be attributed to surface leakage, interface states due to small lattice mismatch, and/or
electron tunneling from the valence band in the n-type GaSb layer to the conduction band in the quaternary
layer due to its broken-gap heterostructure, and generation-recombination centers in the GaInAsSb absorbing
layer.
C. GaInAs/InAsP PIN Heterojunction Photodetectors and Focal Planar Array.
The InGaAs/InAsP epitaxial device structure, as shown in Table I, was grown by metal-organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD) on the n+-InP substrate. Highly reliable selective-area-diffusion (SAD) planar
device process, either by sealed-ampoule diffusion or spin-on diffusion, was utilized for device fabrication.
Silicon nitride (SiNx) film with 1500-Å thickness was deposited onto the entire wafer by plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Through conventional photolithographic process and reactive ion
etching (RIE), diffusion windows with 50-贡m diameter were opened on the dielectric film. Afterwards, wafer
was loaded into semi-closed diffusion system and zinc (Zn)–diffusion process was performed at 550℃ for 10
min. Such a temperature and period produced a 1017 cm-3 acceptor front at 1.2-um deep below the surface.
Due to a rather slow diffusion of Zn in InGaAs (3 times slower than that in InP), the Zn protrusion depth into
the InGaAs can be well controlled to be about 0.1-0.2 um, which was designed for reliability, wide spectral
range, and high-speed operation considerations. After impurity activation by RTA and conventionally
photolithographic process, ring-shaped p-contact metallization chromium (Cr)/gold (Au)/AuZn/Cr was
deposited on heavily doped p-type InP cap layer. The contact adhesion was enhanced by heat treatment. Then
the InP cap layer inside the 30-um-diameter coupling aperture was removed by a reactive ion etching with the
CH4/H2 source to slightly etch and recondition the InP surface and then by chemical etching based on the

6of a CPW-fed monopole antenna. The characteristics of the fabricated antennas were not influenced by
removing half of the ground plane. In the past, the L-shaped monopole dual-band antennas were fabricated on
the FR4 substrates [4].
In this study, there were three reasons for us using Al2O3 ceramic as substrate and using printed
method to fabricate the designed monopole antennas [5]. First, the FR4 substrate is not suitable for the
fabrication of small size microwave antennas because of the lower dielectric constant (εr =4.2). Using square
Al2O3 ceramic (the thickness was 0.4 mm,r9.8) as the substrate, the size of designed monopole antenna can
be reduced due to the higher dielectric constant. Second, the Ag/Pd paste is used as the paste and the printed
method is used to get the designed antenna patterns. The printed method has a lower environmental pollution
problem, because this method does not need using the FeCl3 solution to etch the Cu plate from the surfaces of
Duroid or FR4 substrates. And third, the printed method is easy for mass production. In general, the
conventional microstrip-line antennas fabricated on the ceramic substrate have the shortcomings of narrow
bandwidth (BW) and smaller return loss (S11), because ceramic substrates have lower loss tangent. However,
using a thinner Al2O3 ceramic substrate will improve the characteristics of antennas [6]. In this paper, we will
show that the W-shaped triple-band (operated at 2.4 GHz, 3.5 GHz, and 5.2 GHz) monopole antennas are
successfully designed and fabricated on Al2O3 substrate.
2. Design and Fabrication of Triple-Band Monopole Antenna
The HFSS fullwave electromagnetic field simulator was used to find the optimal parameters of
microstrip-line-fed W-shaped triple-band monopole antennas (abbreviated as W-shaped antenna) on Al2O3
ceramic substrates. When the 0.635 mm and 1 mm Al2O3 ceramics were used as the substrate, the
electromagnetic energy from the radiation patterns were difficult to radiate from the substrate, the S11
values were decreased. The low loss of Al2O3 ceramic was the reason and the antennas with the
characteristics were not suitable for the use of modern communications. We had found that the Al2O3
ceramic with the thickness of 0.4 mm was the better choose to fabricate the monopole triple-band antennas,
because the characteristics of developed antennas were improved [6].
Even some Rogers Duroid printed boards had the dielectric constant of 10.2 and low dielectric
loss, it was indeed too expensive for commercial applications. The Al2O3 ceramic substrates had a comparably
higher dielectric constant of 9.4, a smaller dielectric loss less than 0.001, and low price. For those reasons, the
filter was built on 0.4 mm thickness Al2O3 ceramic substrates for pattern minimization. The proposed antenna
is shown in Fig.1, and the low environmental pollution of printing method was used to fabricate the proposed
triple antenna. The printing method did not need using the FeCl3 solution to etch the Cu plate from the surface
of Duroid or FR4 substrates [6]. The printing mask was done according to the designed patterns and used to
print the Ag/Pd paste on the Al2O3 ceramic substrates. After printing, the pattern was sintered in an oven at
700oC for 15min. Finally, two SMA connectors were welded as the input/output of the fabricated antennas,
and the characteristics were measured using a vector network analyzer (Agilent-N5230A) and a far-field
measurement system.
8W-shaped antenna has the triple-band characteristics. The simulated results of the appropriate resonant
frequencies are 2.41 GHz, 3.69 GHz, and 5.28 GHz with the S11 values of 21.2 dB, 33.9 dB, and 34.5 dB. The
BW values are 2.90 % (70 MHz, 2.37 GHz~2.44 GHz), 11.7% (430 MHz, 3.48 GHz~3.91 GHz), and 12.1%
(640 MHz, 4.81 GHz~5.45 GHz). However, as Fig.5 shows, the measured results for the W-shaped antenna
really offered the advantages of triple-band. The measured results of the appropriate resonant frequencies are
2.34 GHz, 3.63 GHz, and 5.14 GHz with the S11 values of 24.5 dB, 21.8 dB, and 35.5 dB. The BW values are
11.1% (260 MHz, 2.20 GHz~2.46 GHz), 12.4% (450 MHz, 3.43 GHz~3.88 GHz), and 15.2% (780 MHz, 4.66
GHz~5.44 GHz), respectively.

Figure 6 shows the antenna gains of W-shaped antenna across the different bands. The three peak
antenna gains are 2.08 dBi, 3.99 dBi, and 4.88 dBi at 2.34 GHz, 3.63 GHz, and 5.14 GHz. The antenna gains
within the 10 dB impedance bandwidths of 2.20 GHz~2.46 GHz, 3.43 GHz~3.88 GHz, and 4.66 GHz~5.44
GHz are larger than 1.30 dBi, 1.42 dBi, and 1.66 dBi, respectively. The measured far-field radiation patterns
for the W-shaped antenna at different resonant frequencies are plotted in Fig.7. The W-shaped antenna also
has the nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns in the E-plane and monopole like radiation patterns in the
H-plane. This paper also proposed an important result that by properly designing the shapes of radiation
electrode and using Al2O3 ceramic as substrate, a novel printed triple-band monopole antenna with compact
size, wide impedance bandwidth, and good radiation characteristics suitable for different operations were
achieved.
