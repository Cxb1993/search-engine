In nonlinear programming, the Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are used to
solve constrained optimization problems. The Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are
suitable only for differentiable and convex problems. Unfortunately, the mixed-integer
constrained optimization problems are just nondifferentiable. However, the saddle
point theorem [16] can provide sufficient conditions for solving constrained
optimization problems without any differentiability or convexity requirements. It
states that, if a point is a saddle point of the augmented Lagrange function associated
with the primal problem, then the point is the solution of the primal problem.
Accordingly, in this study the saddle point theorem is used to solve mixed-integer
constrained optimization problems.
If )( ***  ,,z is a saddle point of the augmented Lagrange function
)( ,z,aL , then )( ***  ,,z satisfies the following condition:
)()()( ******  ,z,,,z,,z aaa LLL  . (4)
The saddle point can be obtained by minimizing )( **  ,z,aL with the optimal
Lagrange multipliers )( **  , as a fixed parameter vector. However, the difficulty of
this minimization is that it requires the knowledge of )( **  , previously. In general,
the optimal values of Lagrange multipliers are unknown a priori. The duality theorem
can be employed to overcome this difficulty.
According to the duality theorem, the primal problem (1) can be transformed
into a dual problem as follows:
max ( , )
( , )
H (5)
where the dual function )( ,H is denoted as
)(min)(  ,z,,
z a

, and the set  {( , ) ( , ) }  H exists, and 0 .
Therefore, according to these duality relations, we can construct an evolutionary
max-min algorithm to solve mixed-integer constrained optimization problems. The
evolutionary min-max algorithm given in Table 1 includes two phases. In the first
phase (step 2 in Table 1), the MIHDE [1-3] is used to minimize the augmented
Lagrange function with multipliers fixed. In the second phase (step 3 in Table 1), the
Lagrange multipliers are updated to ascend the value of the dual function toward
obtaining maximization of the dual problem.

fm objective functions should be minimized as much as possible under the given
constraints.
The fuzzy requirements of the k objective function can be quantified by the
membership function  ),(~ yxf ii , fmi ,,1 . In general, the membership function
 ),(~ yxf ii is a strictly monotone decreasing function stated by the DM. For
example, a triangular function is a strictly monotone decreasing function and can be
used to denote the membership function  ),(~ yxf ii . The membership function
 ),(~ yxf ii is defined as follows:

Except for triangular functions, other types of functions, like trapezoid,
exponential and hyperbolic functions, are frequently selected to define the
membership functions.
Following the fuzzy decision of Bellman and Zadeh [17], the original
MOMINLP problem can be interpreted as a fuzzy multiobjective mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (FMOMINLP) problem:
