1. Introduction 
The hydrostatic bearings are requested to 
satisfy the operating conditions such as high 
speeds, high power supply and large 
lubrication film stiffness characteristics. The 
research of the flow structure in a closed, lid 
driven cavity has been treated extensively in 
the last few decades. As a part of the class of 
separated flows, the closed cavity problem has 
mainly a fundamental theoretical importance. 
In recent years there has been sustained 
activity towards improved modelling of the 
flow in a hydrostatic pocket. Most of the 
recent work has concentrated towards implicit 
lumped treatment of the pocket performance 
in the numerical environment of the total 
solution of the Reynolds equation for the 
entire hydrostatic bearing.  
Numerous authors have analyzed the 
overall thermofluid and dynamic performance 
of the hydrostatic bearing. We shall mention 
here only a few. Sharma et al. [1] observed 
bearings which have four different recess 
shapes including a square recess bearing, a 
circular recess bearing, a triangular recess 
bearing and an elliptical recess bearing for 
their static and dynamic performance 
parameters which include minimum film 
thickness, flow rate, rotor dynamic 
coefficients and threshold speed. Braun et al. 
[2] performed 2-D numerical visualization 
experiments of the flow in a hydrostatic 
pocket concentrating on the effects of the 
pocket aspect ratio, position of the restrictor 
on the pocket floor, and the inclination of the 
restrictor with regard to the direction of 
rotation, the flow in the cavity was thoroughly 
mapped, and the appearance and development 
of central vertical cells (CVC) and pocket up 
stream and downstream secondary 
recirculation eddies was well documented. 
Braun and Dzodzo [3] also studied 
numerically the two-dimensional flow 
morphology under different pocket geometries 
and Reynolds number conditions. The authors 
have also systematically separated, and 
quantified the contribution of the Coutte and 
Poiseuille effects to the pressure developed 
under the runner, as well as the variation of 
the pressure in the radial direction. Braun and 
Batur [4] visualized non-intrusively the flow 
in a hydrostatic pocket bearing by means of a 
full flow field tracking method. They studied 
the nature of the flow patterns due to changes 
in the angular velocity of the shaft pocket inlet 
mass flow and bearing clearance. Sharma et al. 
[5] used the finite element method to compute 
the performance characteristics of a circular 
thrust pad hydrostatic bearing with circular, 
rectangular, elliptical and annular recesses. A 
comparative study of the various bearing 
configurations has been carried out vis-à-vis 
different compensating devices such as 
capillary, orifice, and constant flow valve 
restrictors so as to study the combined 
influence of the geometry shape of recesses 
and the compensating device on bearing 
performance. Braun et al. [6] studied 2-D and 
3-D recess depth and feed-line problems of

    Clearly, the element coefficient matrix, 
and hence the global coefficient matrix, 
depends on the velocity field, which is not 
known a priori. Therefore, an iterative 
solution procedure is required. At the 
beginning of the first iteration, the velocity 
field is set to zero and the global equations are 
solved for the nodal velocities and pressure. In 
the second iteration, the coefficient matrices 
are evaluated using the velocity field obtained 
in the first iteration, and the assembled 
equations are solved again for the nodal 
velocities. This procedure is repeated until the 
velocity field obtained at the end of two 
consecutive iterations differs by a small 
preassigned number. The convergence 
criterion can be expressed as

    During the parametric study, the 
non-dimensional velocity component in x 
direction of the runner is set to u 1= . While, 
the velocity of the runner is set to U 21= m/s 
for the high-modified Reynolds number, and 
U 1= m/s for the low modified Reynolds 
number, respectively. The rest of the boundary 
conditions set the magnitudes of the velocity 
to u 0=  and v 0=  along the walls. 
(4) The pressure on the boundary is set equal 
to the supply pressure on each restrictor 
inlet: P 1.0=  
    The lubricant flows from the supply 
pump into a pressure control valve and then 
passes through the restrictor into the bearing 
recess. The pressure in the recess is therefore 
not equal to the supply pressure exiting the 
pump. 
 
4. Simulation results and discussion  
    Effects of the Reynolds number, and 
jet strength. Figures 2 and 3 present the 
effects of the Reynolds number on the flow 
pattern with three kinds of  aspect ratioα = 
0.05, 0.2 and 0.4 and restrictor diameter 
cd =1mm. Figures 2(a)-2(c) are the case in 
lower runner speed u=1m/s i.e. mR 2= , and 
Figures 3(a)-3(c) is the case in higher runner 
speed u=21m/s i.e. mR 42= . Two important 
phenomena are at work here. First, as runner 
speed is increased from 1m/s to 21m/s, the 
Couette effect becomes dominant and the flow 
that originally was outgoing in the upstream 
section is completely turned around. Second, 
the main flow turn point in Fig. 2(a)-2(c) and 
3(a)-3(c), becomes an impingement point that 
recedes down the wall as runner speed 
increases. This observation has significant 
potential importance in the design process of 
the cavity wall profile, especially in the 
regions adjacent to the lands. 
Effects of the cavity aspect ratio (α). 
Figures 2 and 3 present the effect of cavity 
aspect ratio on the flow patterns. Fig. 2(a)-2(c) 
and 3(a)-3(c) show the aspect ratio effects in 
different mR and L  whenα=0.05, 0.2 and 0.4 
respectively. Two major qualitative changes 
can be observed. The first is the diminishing 
capability of the jet to penetrate against the 
motion of the plate and associated shear layer 
as α increases from 0.05, to 0.2 and 0.4, figure 
3(a), 3(b) and 3(c). The second is the 
formation of small recirculation zones in the 
vicinity of the jet entrance zones. As α is 
increased from 0.05 to 0.2 and 0.4 one can see 
that central vertical cells (CVC) has already 
moved in a central position and has grown in 
size. The upstream secondary eddies (USE) 
and downstream secondary eddies (DSE) 
occupy fully the cavity corners in figure 3(a) 
but haven’t the occasion in figure 3(c) because 
figure 3(a) land is larger than figure 3(c). The 
major portion of the jet occupies the central 
part of the cavity, while the CVC is small and 
confined under the driving shear layer. One 
can observe flow patterns that have already 
become familiar from previous figures 
discussion, and conclude that the decrease in 
cavity land length makes the jet more 
prominent, and more coupled from each other 
as the cavity starts to resemble a stilling tank. 
Figure 4 shows the flow patterns in the 
different restrictor diameter with mR 42= , 
52L = , 0.05a = , rh =20 for c 0.737d = , 
c 0.092d = and c 0.006d = . The vortical cell 
is increased with decrease in restrictor 
diameter. So we can deduce that bearing 
increase stability when restrictor diameter is 
increasing. 
Figure 5 shows the flow patterns in the 
different depth of pocket with mR 42= , 
52L = , 0.05a = , c 0.737d =  for rh =20, 
rh = 5 and rh = 1. The hydrodynamic effect 
is obvious in the shallow pocket i.e. figure 
5(c). Thus a higher pressure is needed to 
build up under the lid in order to move the 
fluid out of the pocket and onto the lands. 
One can conclude that in the shallow pocket, 
the CVC that filled the downstream region of 
the deep pocket is replaced by the modified 
vertical cell (MOVC), and by the flattened 
pillow recirculation region. 
    Pressure effects in the hydrostatic/ 
hybrid cavity. Figure 6 presents the variation 
of pressure, along the lid surface for the 
centered normal jet in a cavity with jet 
dominated flow mR 2= , 1111L = , and lid 
clearance h=0.20mm. The effect of the jet 
dominates that of the moving plate and causes 
a symmetric distribution of pressures with 
respect to the center of the pocket, and the 
maximum pressure is generated in the region 
where the jet impacts the runner. This 
situation is supported by the flow pattern 
described in Figs 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c).

ABSTRACT 
This paper has studied the influence of the restriction effect 
on the stability of a rigid rotor in rotation supported by 
double-row, orifice compensated aerostatic bearings. The air 
which is assumed to be perfect gas, passes through orifice 
restrictor into the bearing clearance undergoing the adiabatic 
process is governed by Reynolds equation including the 
coupled effects of wedge due to spindle rotation and squeezed 
film due to journal oscillation. The Ph -method is used to 
analyze Reynolds equation and which is then solved by the 
finite difference method and numerical integration to yield 
static and dynamic characteristics of air film. The motion 
equation of the rotor-bearing system is obtained by using the 
perturbation method and the eigensolution method is used to 
determine the stability threshold and critical whirl ratio. The 
variations of stability threshold of both critical inertial force and 
critical whirl ratio with restriction parameters are analyzed for 
various whirl ratios, speed of journal rotation and eccentricity 
ratios. [Keywords: Aerostatic bearing, Reynolds equation, 
Stability threshold, Whirl ratio]. 
 
1    INTRODUCTION 
The aerostatic bearings are important elements of 
super-precise or/and ultrahigh speed spindles such as machine 
tools, measuring machines and laboratory equipments due to 
its unique and absolute advantages of low friction and high 
accuracy. However, these bearings with low or high speed of 
journal rotation are prone to pneumatic or whirl instability, 
which often restricts their applications. Thus, the static and 
dynamic characteristics and stability analysis for the design of 
aerostatic bearing spindles are necessary. 
Many researchers have been studied various types of 
aerostatic bearing extensively by using analytical or 
experimental methods. Lund [1-3] obtained analytically the 
load capacities and stiffness and damping coefficients which 
are used to examine the whirl instability of an external 
pressurized aerostatic bearing and a three-lobe journal 
aerostatic bearing, respectively. These analyses are based on 
the first-order perturbation with small vibration amplitude but 
the closed form solution of stability threshold cannot be 
obtained. Wadhwa et al. [4] adopted the finite element method 
and modified the perturbation formulation of Lund [2] to 
evaluate the dynamic coefficients and the whirl instability of 
externally pressurized aerostatic bearings. Their results have 
shown that the change of supply pressure can influence the 
bearing performance a little bit at lower design parameter of 
bearing. Moreover, they also proved that the aerostatic 
bearings can be larger load capacity and more stable than plain 
journal bearings in comparison with the somewhat simulation 
conditions. 
Han et al. [5] presented a finite difference method for 
aerostatic bearing with external pressurized supply sources to 
analyze the dynamic characteristics and determine the orbit of 
the rotor center due to unbalance. Talukder and Stowell [6] 
studied the occurrence and characteristics of pneumatic 
hammer of the externally pressurized orifice compensated 
aerostatic bearing. They indicated that the pocket orifice with 
sufficient large diameter and depth can provide maximum 
stiffness; whereas, it is more prone to pneumatic hammer than 
annular orifice. Su and Lie [7] studied comparatively the 
dynamic instability of hybrid air journal bearings with 
multi-arrays of entry holes. Their results indicated that the 
load capacity increases with the change of entry arrays, but 
they didn’t consider the influence of whirl frequency in 
determining the threshold of load capacity. 
Pink and Stout [8] analyzed experimental data of orifice 
compensated air journal bearings. They recognized the load 
capacity is reduced due to pressure dispersion between 
adjacent orifices if the entry number is too few. Kazimierski 
and Trojnarski [9] investigated the entry system of externally 
pressurized gas bearings by transforming the governing 
equation into a difference equation. They demonstrated

3    ANALYSIS 
The configuration of an aerostatic journal bearing with 
orifice feedings which are located double rows about a 
symmetric plane and evenly around the circumference of the 
bearing is shown in Fig. 1(a). The orifices are stepped holes 
with a thin needle hole to discharge pressurized air to the 
lubricating film. With the assumptions of compressible, 
isothermal laminar flow situated in bearing clearance and 
perfect gas for air, the non-dimensional Reynolds equation of 
this air film which is derived from Navier-Stokes and 
continuity equations can be expressed in the two dimensional 
Cartesian coordinates system as shown:

For a bearing with n entry holes per one array around 
circumference surface of bearing, the air flow through the 
orifice of entry hole is governed by either the subsonic or 
supersonic conditions. The method described in Kazimierski 
and Trojnarski [9] is utilized substituting the variation of 
supply mass flow rate of adiabatic process into Eq. (1) gives 
the form of the non-dimensional continuity equation at the 
location of each entry hole as

6    WHIRL INSTABILITY ANALYSIS 
For a rigid rotor supported horizontally by two identical 
journal aero-bearings on both ends, as illustrated in Fig. 2, 
when the bearing is operating under steady-state condition, if 
the gas film in aero-bearing is disturbed by dynamic 
excitations with a frequency Ω , the film will whirl at this 
frequency and attempt to maintain the flow balance. The whirl 
of film will become either more pronounced, or die out, 
depending on the dynamic characteristics of the rotor-bearing 
system. Neglecting conical whirling effect and based on a 
small disturbance from the equilibrium position of the journal, 
the motion equations of journal center about the equilibrium 
axis of the rotor in the fixed reference coordinates ( y ,x ,Ob ) 
are described by

The variations in load capacity W  with respect to

an optimum restriction parameter oΓ  can be determined 
between 62 o ≤≤ Γ  for maximum load capacity W  which 
increases as eccentricity ratio increasing. These results can

The variations of load capacity W  with respect to 
eccentricity ratios ε  for 2o =Γ  and 6o =Γ  are shown in 
Fig. 5. The load capacities of the high speed cases must be 
larger than those of the low speed cases. For low speed of 
journal rotation ( 1=Λ ) the hydrostatic effect dominates over 
the load capacity more than hydrodynamic effect, thus the load 
capacity of small restriction case ( 2o =Γ ) is larger than that 
of large restriction parameter case ( 6o =Γ ). Conversely, for 
high speed of journal rotation ( 5=Λ ) the hydrodynamic 
effect dominates over the load capacity more than hydrostatic 
effect the load capacity becomes very close for small and large 
restriction cases.
