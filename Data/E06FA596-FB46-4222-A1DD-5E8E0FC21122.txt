Analysis of innovation tension between exploitation and exploration: an empirical study of a 
Taiwan TFT-LCD company using chaotic analysis 
 
 
Abstract 
 
Most innovation implementation systems exhibit some form of nonlinear behavior. One general frame of 
explanations for this nonlinearity is chaotic behavior of balancing between exploitation and exploration. This 
paper investigates the chaos behavior of innovation tension of a leading manufacturer of flat panel displays in 
Taiwan. The time series data are collected from patents that are realizations of the innovation implementation 
process over a period of 12 years for a TFT-LCD company in Taiwan. The results clearly indicate that chaotic 
characteristics are in the innovation implementation system. The company that is competing in more stable 
environments benefits from sequentially switching between periods of exploration and exploitation.

1. Introduction 
 
Innovation is the conversion of new knowledge into new products or services. It is important to maintain 
continuing increases in profitability and sustainability for a company. In order to succeed in today’s 
competitive marketplace and to have sustainable growth, companies need to carry out a variety of innovation 
efforts. Two different types of innovation implementation, incremental innovation versus radical innovation, 
have been undertaken. Incremental innovation refers to the exploitation of current technologies and skills that 
pursues short-term survival by generating revenues in the present market, while radical innovation refers to 
the exploration of new technological options that ensures long-term survival by creating the basis for 
obtaining revenue from the future market. The need for exploitation for short-term survival, and exploration 
for long-term survival, creates one of the essential tensions in the management of innovation. This tension is 
referred to as innovation tension (Nag, Corley et al. 2003) . 
  
According to March (March 1991), companies need to create a balance between ‘sustaining’ innovative 
activities that exploit existing knowledge and networks, and ‘radical’ innovative activities that explore entirely 
new opportunities if they are to achieve continued success. Annique (Annique 2007) describes this balanced 
view by using three types of mechanisms: ambidexterity (Tushman and O'Reilly Iii 1996), punctuated 
equilibrium(Gupta, Smith et al. 2006) and specialization(Slggelkow and Rivkin 2006). Ambidexterity is 
defined and considered as to be the capacity to simultaneously pursue both incremental and radical innovation 
and change. Ambidexterity faces many difficulties, since the two innovation types, exploitation and 
exploration, do not only have different characteristics in terms of schedule, risk and potential return, but also 
call for different organizational structures, processes, cultures, and capabilities (Ghemawat and RicartCosta 
1993). Punctuated equilibrium (also referred to as temporal cycling) represents a sequential pattern of longer 
 4
a cycle of discovery framework to explain how exploitation and exploration build on each other. The 
framework was tested empirically to reconstruct and understand the emergence of the pharmaceutical industry. 
Although both exploration and exploitation are important, March argues that these activities are unable to 
coexist in an enterprise. Therefore, enterprises suffer from the problem of choosing one over the other. March 
(March 1996; March 2006) provides three arguments to support this claim. First, he argues that exploration 
and exploitation compete for limited resources. Thus, more resources devoted to one imply fewer left over for 
the other.  Second, the ways of thinking needed for exploration are different from those needed for 
exploitation, making the simultaneous pursuit of both impractical. Third, both types of innovative activities 
are iteratively self-reinforcing. Henderson (Henderson 2006) endorses this argument, arguing that both sides 
apply for the same limited resources, and furthermore, exploratory activities, when successful, may result in 
creative destruction, not only of the core ability and products of competitors, but also of the current 
organization. Tushman & O’Reilly (Tushman and O'Reilly Iii 1996) also argue that exploration and 
exploitation require a totally different way of working, organizing and managing. Therefore, it is difficult to 
merge and to balance within one organization. 
 
Innovation tensions are nested across levels of the company, further intensifying the organizational 
challenges (Smith and Tushman 2005). Recent research has applied different approaches to study the balance 
between exploration and exploitation. Some studies have used panel data research design (Uotila et al., 2009; 
Vanhaverbeke et al., 2005; Katila and Ahuja, 2002), while others have applied a cross-section or pooled 
cross-section analysis (Jansen et al., 2006; He and Wong, 2004). They used different implementations of the 
balance between exploration and exploitation. For instance, there are studies that use as proxies patent data 
(Katila and Ahuja, 2002) or content analysis of news about a company (Uotila et al., 2009). The results of 
these studies imply that large companies that tend to systematically over-emphasize exploitation may reduce 
their long-term performance. Lubatkin et al. (Lubatkin, Simsek et al. 2006) explore the exploration and 
exploitation trade-off by investigating the role of top management team behavioral integration in small and 
medium firms. They find that the role of top managers is important for the balance between exploration and 
exploitation. Sidhu et al. (Sidhu, Commandeur et al. 2007) conceptualize exploration and exploitation in 
terms of a nonlocal-local search continuum in three-dimensional supply, demand, and geographic space. 
Using cross-sectional data from a wide range of manufacturing industries, they develop and validate an 
operational measure of the exploration and exploitation concept. Greve (Greve 2007) tested four 
propositions about exploration and exploitation in product innovation using data on innovations in the 
shipbuilding industry between 1972 and 2000. Fauchart and Keilbach (Fauchart and Keilbach 2009) propose 
a structural model to identify exploration and exploitation innovation strategies by specifying firm growth as 
a function of firm-specific parameters, market-specific parameters, and competition for purchasing power. 
 
Jayanthi and Sinha (Jayanthi and Sinha 1998) explored the dynamics of balancing between exploitation 
and exploration by using a logistic difference equation, and explained that innovation implementation in high 
technology manufacturing can be conceptualized as a chaotic process. The concepts of balance may imply 
equilibrium (Carlisle and McMillan 2006). Nemanich, Keller et al suggested using visual representations of 
innovation trajectories, as shown in Fig. 1, to aid the discussion of companies shifting their innovation 
implementation strategies with respect to their emphasis on exploration and exploitation(Nemanich, Keller et 
 6
 
The reconstruction of nonlinear dynamics from a short innovation implementation time series has been 
an attractive issue in innovation management. Innovation implementation can be conceptualized as a chaotic 
process (Jayanthi and Sinha 1998) in which the cycle of the innovation implementation process represents a 
sequence of explorative and exploitative activities. In this study, we apply chaos theory to depict the 
innovation implementation process. Two important issues need to be resolved when using chaos theory to 
analyze innovation tension, (1) lack of a mechanism for global measure of exploratory and exploitative 
innovative competence, and (2) insufficience of time series data for chaos analysis. The following section 
focuses on how to address these two issues. 
 
3.1. Global measurement of exploratory and exploitative innovation competence 
 
Jayanthi and Sinha (Jayanthi and Sinha 1998) tested the chaotic process by using production time series 
data of yield, cycle time and activities from a wafer fabrication plant over a period of 125 weeks. The 
empirical analysis was based on secondary data. They claimed that the 125 weekly production reports of the 
plant represent ongoing exploitative and exploratory activities at the plant. Since such longitudinal field 
studies should also be suitable for other high technology manufacturing companies, we should use primary 
data to analyze innovation implementation processes. The primary data used to measure exploration and 
exploitation activities should be based on more broad terms instead of using the data from rather specific 
production technology. Because exploration versus exploitation is a general concept, previous studies have 
proposed different methods including: (1)  learning radicalness (Bierly and Chakrabarti 1996), (2) patent 
search scope and depth (Katila and Ahuja 2002), (3) the degree to which search behavior is both 
technologically and organizationally boundary-spanning (Rosenkopf and Nerkar 2001), and (4) a composite 
measurement of the newness of business development (McGrath 2001) to measure exploitative and 
explorative innovative competence as the primary data. 
 
For most high technology manufacturing companies, the most tangible outcomes for innovation 
implementation are patents which are a useful basis of technical information that companies can use to put 
into their innovation operation. Patents are also the most widely available indicators of output of technological 
and innovative activities (Kurtossy 2004). Total number of patents granted for a company can be classified 
into two groups: exploratory and exploitative inventions. Citation data contained in the patents were also used 
to perform this differentiation. Exploratory innovative capability represents the ability to perform extensive 
searches that result in novel methods or materials technologically distant from existing innovations. Based on 
the definition of Ahuja and Lampert (Ahuja and Lampert 2001), the index  of exploratory innovative 
competence is measured by counting the patents that  completely depart from the company’s prior 
knowledge base and present new knowledge to other companies and to the market. 
 
Katila and Ahuja (Katila and Ahuja 2002) proposed the measures of search depth and scope to study the 
possible interactions between exploitative and explorative strategies. The depth measure, representing 
exploitative activities, describes how deeply a firm reuses its existing knowledge. The more frequently a 
company has used knowledge, the more deeply it exploits it. The scope measure, which corresponds to the 
 8
process can generate such a series? Jayanthi, et al. (Jayanthi and Sinha 1998) claim that the dynamics of 
balancing between exploitation and exploration in high technology manufacturing can be conceptualized by a 
chaotic process that is an intermediate between the deterministic relationship and the stochastic relationship, 
and it has broadened existing deterministic patterns. When analysis methods using systems of equations are to 
be applied to study the chaotic process, valid mathematical models of innovation implementation systems 
based on differential or difference equations are required. However, up to now no valid models consisting of 
differential or difference equations are currently available for modeling innovation implementation activities.  
 
The essential idea of nonlinear time series analysis is that a structurally complex system can be described 
with a strange attractor in its phase space. This idea is called embedding, which has been proven by Takens 
(Takens 1981). Chaos is a behavior similar to stochastic motion, i.e., it occurs in a deterministic nonlinear 
system without any other random factors. There are several parameters suitable to explain chaotic dynamics, 
such as correlation dimension, Kolmogorov entropy and Lyapunov characteristic exponents. Dimension is 
used to estimate the system’s complexity; entropy and characteristic exponents are used to estimate the level 
of chaos in the dynamic system. One of the most used indices for detecting the presence of chaos in a dynamic 
system is the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), which is the average rate of exponential divergence of close 
trajectories. In phase space, the LLE of point attractors is negative, while that of limits cycles is null and that 
of chaotic systems is positive. In other words, a positive LLE indicates chaos whenever we know that the 
system under study is deterministic and bounded and that the set of data is representative. 
 
To detect chaos on observational data relies on constructing an approximation of the measure on a 
strange attractor, which requires knowing the embedding dimension by observing the system for at least a few 
hundred sets of time series data. The Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm (Grassberger and Procaccia 1983) 
appears to be the most popular method used to quantify chaos. However, innovation implementation time 
series are usually relatively short compared with series from other disciplines where nonlinear dynamics is 
studied, such as physics or economics. Therefore, the major difficulties in this time series analysis are too 
small data size, insufficient replications and impractical manipulation. One challenge problem we are facing is 
whether or not we can infer the existence of an underlying chaotic dynamics from this very short time series. 
Very short time series data of innovation implementation activities of 10 or 20 years might not reveal the true 
dynamics underlying innovation tension, especially if the data is common grained and includes only ending 
years. Therefore, this paper will focus on time series with a small amount of data due to limited background 
information, which makes it difficult to employ traditional chaotic analysis methods. 
 
3.3 Rosenstein’s method for calculating the LLE index and correlation dimension 
 
There are different methods for calculating the Lyapunov exponents of time series data. In this research, 
the LLE and correlation dimension were computed according to the algorithm proposed by Rosenstein et al. 
(Rosenstein, Collins et al. 1993). We chose this algorithm based on the following reasons:  
(1) The proposed method for calculating LLE and correlation dimension works well for small data 
sets;  
(2) Their proposed calculation procedure of the method is directly based on the definition of the 
1ln ( ) ln ( )j jd i C i tλ≅ + ⋅+          (8) 
The Lyapunov exponent quantifies the exponential divergence/convergence of initially close trajectories. 
Chaotic systems typically show an initial linear increase in the separation of trajectories, followed by a 
constant plateau since chaotic attractors are bounded. The Lyapunov exponent can be estimated by the slope 
of a straight line that is fitted to the linear part of the ln-transformed divergence. Eq. (8) represents a set of 
approximately parallel lines (for j = 1,2,..., M ), each with a slope roughly proportional to λ1, i.e., the LLE is 
estimated using a least squares fit to “average “line defined by: 
1( ) ln ( )jy i dt
= + i            (9) 
where "  stands for the average over all values of j.  This process of averaging is the key to calculating 
accurate values of λ1 using small, noisy data sets. 
 
In addition to calculating the LLE, Rosenstein’s algorithm also calculates the correlation dimension, D2, 
which is a measure for distinguishing between chaotic and stochastic behaviors in a nonlinear time series. The 
Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm (Grassberger and Procaccia 1983) estimates dimension by examining the 
scaling properties of the correlation sum, Cm(r). For a given embedding dimension, m, Cm(r) is given by 
, 1
2( ) lim ( )
( 1)
N
i j
N i j
C r H r X X
N N→∞ =
= −∑− −      (10) 
where H() is the Heavyside step function. Therefore, Cm(r) is interpreted as the fraction of pairs of points 
that are separated by a distance less than or equal to r. If the time series is characterized by an attractor, then 
for positive values of r the correlation function C(r) is related to the radius r by the following relation: 
2( ) DC r rα∝             (11) 
where α is a constant; and D2 is the correlation dimension or the slope of the logC(r) versus logr plot 
given by 
2
0
log ( )lim
logr
C rD
r→=            (12) 
The slope can be estimated by a least squares fit of a straight line over a certain range of r, called the 
scaling region (Shang, Li et al. 2005). For a finite data set, such as the innovation tension time series, it is 
clear that there is a separation r below which there are no pairs of points; that is, it is ‘‘depopulated’’. At the 
other extreme, when the value of r exceeds the set diameter, the correlation function increases no further; it is 
‘‘saturated’’. Therefore, for a finite data set, the region between the depopulation region and the saturation 
region is considered the scaling region. To observe whether or not chaos exists, the correlation dimension (or 
local slope) values are plotted against the corresponding embedding dimension values. If the value of the D2 
exhibits finite, low, and non-integer, then the system can be considered to reveal low-dimension chaos. The 
saturation value of the correlation dimension is defined as the correlation dimension of the attractor. On the 
contrary, when the embedding dimension increases, if the corresponding correlation dimension increases 
without bound, the system under investigation is considered as stochastic.

leading to the rise of TFT-LCD as a guidepost for further product and process change (Hung and Tu 2009). 
The company had extensive exploration activities on TFT-LCD in 1998 and gradually shifted toward 
exploitation up till 2006. In other words, the company aspired to establish its process technology and tended 
to enhance operational efficiency through new growth platforms, shifting over to exploitation and growth 
from 1998 to 2006. From 2007, the price of big flat screen TFT-LCD TV’s became affordable for general 
public, and the TFT-LCD panel product volume of units manufactured became comparable with that of Korea. 
After the Korea Company used the lower price strategy to impact Taiwan panel industry and the TFT LCD 
technology had stepped into mature stage, the company took a major strategic shift from a trend of increasing 
exploitation to increasing exploration in 2007 for the future trends of large-size, touch, 3D and soft panels to 
satisfy future markets. Figure 4 also reveals that the company maintained a fairly constant balance between 
exploration and exploitation in the periods of 2003 to 2004 and 2008 to 2009.

The slope of the line in the scaling region is the correlation dimension. The relationship between the 
correlation dimension values and the embedding dimension values is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the 
correlation dimension value increases with the embedding dimension up to a certain value and then saturates 
beyond that value.  The saturation of the correlation dimension beyond a certain embedding dimension value 
is an indication of the existence of deterministic dynamics. The saturated correlation dimension is about 2.17 
(D2 = 2.17), and the embedding dimension M = 6. The finite and low correlation dimension is an indication 
that the innovation tension series exhibit chaotic behavior.

Figure 7. Relationship between embedding dimension and correlation dimension 
 
Figure 8 shows the divergence plot of <lndj(i)> versus time in different embedding dimensions from 
M=2 to M=6. Each line in the figure has its slope equal to the calculated value λ1. In figure 9, each curve is a 
plot of slope versus time for different embedding dimensions, where the slope is calculated from a 
least-squares fit to 10-point segments of the <lndj(i)> versus i⋅Δt curve. We observe a clear and repeatable 
stage from about i⋅Δt =3 to about i⋅Δt =5 in the curve of M=6.  By using this range to define the region for 
extracting λ1, we obtain a reliable estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent: λ1=0.115±0.001. Application of 
the LLE-test to the innovation tension time series suggests that there is evidence to support the positivity of 
the exponent and thus that the company in this empirical study is dealing with a chaotic innovation 
implementation system.

deterministic and can be analyzed using the chaos techniques.  
 
According to the suggestion by Jayanthi and Sinha that “the empirical analysis should be conducted 
using primary data on the innovation implementation process” (Jayanthi and Sinha 1998), we use depth and 
scope search concepts to analyze patent content and extract exploitation and exploration information as the 
primary data for calculating an innovation balance index. Our results do not only contribute to the relevant 
literature by providing valuable empirical studies, but they also have practical implications for senior 
management. Since the innovation implementation of the company do behave as chaotic systems, two 
implications for innovation management can be drawn as follows: 
(1) The innovation implementation system is extremely sensitive to initial conditions, which makes 
long-term planning of enhancing innovative capability very difficult. Slight differences in the 
earliest stages of the implementation process can result in significantly large differences in the 
potentials of the innovations realized in the long term. The company needs to take into account a 
number of possible scenarios to deal with the trade-off between higher innovative competence and 
greater costs produced by technological diversification. The question of who should be involved in 
the exploitation, or exploration, or both, and for how long are also a critical issue. 
(2) Exploitation and exploration have different effects on the performance of firms and neither activity 
is independent or mutually exclusive of the other. We find empirical support for the presence of a 
strange attractor in the innovation implementation system of the company. The company was 
capable of maintaining a punctuated equilibrium of cycling though periods of exploration and 
exploitation rather than pursuing both exploration and exploitation synchronously before 2006. 
The company faced a more dynamic and competitive market after 2006. Hence, it took 
simultaneous innovation strategy to pursuit balance of exploration and exploitation.  
 
This paper presents a longitudinal field study of one plant. The primary limitation of this research is 
that we applied the depth and scope search of technology classification on the patent context as the only 
source for mining the innovation balance index. There is a need to continue investigations aimed at 
integrating other innovation indicators derived from patent data as the sources of primary data for 
characterizing innovation tension. Such longitudinal field studies should also be applied to other high 
technology manufacturing companies.

Abstract. Data mining refers to use of new methods for the intelligent analysis of 
large data sets. This paper applies one of nonlinear state space modeling (NSSM) 
techniques named nonlinear dynamical factor analysis (NDFA) to mine the latent 
factors which are the original sources for producing the observations of causal 
time series. The purpose of mining indirect sources rather than the time series 
observation is that much better results can be obtained from the latent sources, for 
example, economics data driven by an "explanatory variables" like inflation, 
unobserved trends and fluctuations. The effectiveness of NDFA is evaluated by a 
simulated time series data set. Our empirical study indicates the performance of 
NDFA is better than the independent component analysis in exploring the latent 
sources of Taiwan unemployment rate time series. 
Keywords: Data mining, latent sources, time series, nonlinear state space 
modeling, nonlinear dynamical factor analysis. 
1   Introduction 
Starting from 1980s, modeling time series has become a popular theme [1] for 
understanding the behaviors of the dynamical process by observing responses. A time 
series is sequence of regularly sampled quantities from an observed process which is 
frequently driven by a rather small, typically unobservable set of influences. For 
example, when there are a multivariate time series that represents the quantity sold and 
price associated with demand for a product or service, it is often desirable to decide the 
influences of price and the demand. Such the latent time series describe the underlying 
data-generating process of a dependent time series using some latent sources 
(explanatory variables). The developments of this paper were motivated by the need for 
exploring the driven processes for the given observations. These driven processes 
contain quantities that cannot be measured direct. Instead, only a portion of 
noise-corrupted observation is available. Such an effort is needed because the 
measurement process is either more expensive or more impossible for the latent time 
series [2]. The present work is therefore interested in the problem of reverse 
engineering of a time series where one uses a set of given time series xt to get another 
hidden set of time series st. 
In this paper, we used the state space model (SSM) as the data mining technique to 
explore the latent sources. SSM is a model comprised of two parts: states and

closed form solution for the distribution of the sources in (3) and (4). Because in an 
NSSM, the statistical learning problem is no longer solved in the closed form as 
opposed to the linear SSM and this raises several computational difficulties. Quach et 
al. [10] used an unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) technique to tackle nonlinearities by 
deriving NSSMs from ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The nonlinear mapping 
in (3) and (4) can be modeled by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks or a radial 
basis function (RBF) network which suit well to modeling both strong and mild 
nonlinearities [11]. In this paper, we apply a method called nonlinear dynamical factor 
analysis (NDFA), which is based on variational Bayesian learning [12, 13], for learning 
form of (3) and (4) in an NSSM of a dynamic process. Variational Bayesian methods, 
also called ensemble learning[14], are a group of methods to approximate intractable 
integrals arising in Bayesian inference and machine learning. 
3   Nonlinear Dynamical Factor Analysis 
This section briefly introduces the NDFA model and its learning algorithm. A 
comprehensive discussion can be found in [12, 13]. The NDFA model is a dynamical 
extension of nonlinear factor analysis (NFA) [11]. The function of NDFA is to find 
dynamic sources which explain nonlinearity of the observed data[8]. In NDFA, the 
mapping from sources to observations is modeled by a multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to 
represent the nonlinearity. Like in figure 1, the sources are on the top layer and 
observations in the bottom layer. The middle layer consists of hidden neurons of 
sigmoidal nonlinearities each of which estimates a nonlinear function of the inputs as  
xt  = Z(st,θz)+nt=Bφ(As+a)+b+nt=Btanh(As+a)+b+ nt . (5) 
where the matrices A and B are the weights of the hidden and output layer and a and b 
are the corresponding biases. The tanh is a common nonlinear activation function φ 
being used in the MLPs. The function T has a similar mapping structure except the 
MLP network is used to model only the change in the state values. 
T(s)=s+Dφ(Cs+c)+d=s+Dtanh(Cs+c)+d . (6)

mutual information. To determine the proper embedding dimension m, the false nearest 
neighbors (FNN) method [20] can be used. 
 
Step 2: Determine number of latent sources and set up the initial values for the sources.  
According to the Fig 1, mining latent sources using NDFA requires prior knowledge 
of the number of sources before the ensemble learning can be performed. Here, we 
applied ICA approach and used a measure of the number of sources based on the 
normalized determinant value of the global matrix (G) to determine the number of 
sources in the given observations [21]. The global matrix G is the product of estimated 
the mixing matrix and unmixing matrix. It can be stated that if |G| is near to zero, then it 
points out there are some dependent sources. So, the number of sources should be fewer 
than the number of variables of observations. Otherwise, if |G| is near to one, the 
number of sources can be assumed to be equal to the number of observational variables. 
FastICA [22] can be applied to obtain the mixing matrix and unmixing matrix. Another 
alternative to determine the number of latent sources is based on the eigenvalue 
spectrum of the data covariance matrix. Everson & Roberts [23] proposed a method of 
inferring the true eigenvalue spectrum from the sample spectrum. 
Because of the flexibility of the MLP network and the gradient based learning 
algorithm, the NDFA is sensitive to the initialization. Honkela and Valpola suggested 
to use linear PCA for initialization of the means of the sources S [16].   
 
Step 3: Determine number of hidden neurons in the mappings Z and T in (3) and (4) 
which are modeled by an MLP network.  
There is no magic formula for selecting the best number of hidden neurons. Santos et 
al. [24] proposed a novel technique to estimate the number of hidden neurons of an 
MLP. The proposed approach consists in the post-training application of SVD/PCA to 
the back-propagated error and local gradient matrices associated with the hidden 
neurons. The number of hidden neurons is then set to the number of relevant singular 
values or eigenvalues of the involved matrices. Some thumb rules are also available for 
calculating number of hidden neurons such as the following:  
 
1. The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and 
the size of the output layer. 
2. The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the 
size of the output layer.  
3. The number of hidden neurons should be fewer than twice the size of the input 
layer.  
 
Step 4: Decide nonlinear activation function to use in the MLP. Typical choices for φ 
include tanh or the logistic sigmoid function.  
In case of the inputs of the hidden neurons are not Gaussian, use the standard logistic 
sigmoid activation function in the form of tanh which is more common and faster to 
evaluate numerically.  
 
Step 5: Decide the approximation method for the nonlinearity.  
Since it is impossible to find any closed form for the distribution of the sources, we 
should use a fixed form approximation where the form is fixed and only the parameters 
are optimized by minimizing the cost function. Two natural choices for the functional 
form of the approximation for the nonlinearity are Taylor approximation for low

We then estimate the number of sources for searching. Based on the Naik and Kumar 
[21] method, the determinant of global matrix parameters of ICA is used to estimate the 
number of search sources. We calculated |G|=2.6557e-035≈0 which shows several 
dependent sources are presented. Observing the plot of eigenvalues of covariance 
matrix in Figure 6, we eliminated three signals from the five observations and set two 
latent sources for searching.

this specific application may be unrealistic. This paper presents a unified data mining 
framework for jointly defining process dynamics models and measurements taken on 
the process. The framework is a state-space model where the process is modeled by the 
state process and measurements are modeled by the observation process. Parameter 
estimation and estimation of state process variables can be conducted using MLP with 
ensemble learning procedures.
