a design are used in selecting design alternatives
within the acceptable objective variations. Ad-
ditional tolerance design scheme is implemented
to ensure that design alternatives meet the tar-
get tolerance regions. This work enables decision-
makers to select their best design alternatives on
the Pareto set given three criteria of different pur-
poses. Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of
the method on both single- and multi-level sys-
tems.

1 Introductions
This research studies the optimal design and tol-
erance allocation for multi-objective engineering
problems with formulations in Eq.(1). nf objec-
tives are optimized simultaneous in Eq.(1b) while
design variables x are subjected to variations.
given ∆fT = {∆fT1 , · · · ,∆fTnf } (1a)

minimize tolerance cost (1c)
with respect to {x,∆x} (1d)
subject to X(x,∆x) ∈ F (1e)
The uncertainties X are uniquely determined
via input design variables x and tolerances ∆x
as shown in Eq.(1e). A set of maximal accept-
able objective variations, ∆fT in Eq.(1a), are
given to the designers. ∆fT and the inequality
constraints g form the feasible space F . The in-
put uncertainties X due to manufacturing or as-
sembly tolerances result in output performance
variations including objectives f and constraints
g. The tolerance design cost in Eq.(1c) is the
cost to meet the desired performance variation
ranges. In this study, we consider constraints be-
ing satisfied in the worst-case scenario such that
max{g(X)} ≤ 0.

Discussions on Eq.(1) in the literature can be
categorized into different focuses, namely toler-
ance synthesis, tolerance allocation, robust de-
sign, and multiobjective design optimization. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes the domain of interest between
this work and similar studies in the literature. In
what follows, we will use an output performance
characteristic y as a nonlinear function of input
variables x such that y = f(x). The uncertain-
ties X within the tolerance region result in the
variation in y.
Tolerance synthesis considers the impact of un-
certainties X on objective functions, Eq.(1b), or
on constraints, Eq.(1e). The choices on the tol-
erance models determine the method in accessing
the impacts of these uncertainties on the output
performances. When tolerances are specified as
intervals [1, 2], a sensitivity matrix is generally
applied [3], resulting in either the worst case for-
mulation in Eq.(2a) or the statistical analysis in
Eq.(2b).

Equations in (2), also referred to as tolerance
stackup in the literature, imply the function f is
relatively linear and may yield large errors when
apply to nonlinear problems. Methods such as
Monte Carlo simulation or advanced sampling
techniques can then be used for tolerance analysis
with significant computational expenses; for ex-
ample, see [4,5]. When tolerances are modeled as
random distributions [6, 7], predominately Gaus-
sian, probability functions of y = f(X) are gen-
erally studied. Martosell et. al use Monte Carlo
sampling in obtaining these probability functions
[6]. Xu et. al in [7] and Savage et. al in [8] use
the first order reliability method in estimating the
propagated variations.
With the tolerance analysis methods in the lit-
erature, one can study the best assignments to
set the tolerance level of each design variable or
parameters such that the overall product perfor-
mance is satisfactory. From Table 1, tolerance
allocation treats input tolerances as design vari-
ables and minimizes the tolerance cost in Eq.(1c).
Various tolerance cost models have been proposed
with the main concept being that the manufac-
turing cost generally increases with smaller tol-
erances [9]. Common cost models include re-
ciprocal model Eq.(3a), reciprocal-power model
Eq.(3b), exponential model Eq.(3c) and combi-
nations of above, for example the exponential-
reciprocal model Eq.(3d). A and B in Eq.(3) are
parameters to be fitted with on-site data.

multiobjective optimization with tolerance allo-
cation when uncertainties exist in design vari-
ables or parameters. A worst-case Pareto set is
first generated using the Eq.(4) with input uncer-
tainty ranges considered as parameters. To avoid
possibly non-convex Pareto set, we use constraint
method in Pareto set generation.

f(x) = {f1(x), · · · , fnf (x)} (4)
subject to max{g(x,∆x)} ≤ 0
The performance variation of the points on the
Pareto set, denoted as Pareto points, will then
be investigated via uncertainty analysis. We in-
troduce the optimality influence range to quan-
tify objective functions variations. Influence ar-
eas as well as signal-to-noise influence ratio will
be used to determine the performance of a Pareto
point under uncertainty. If one or more Pareto
points and their influence ranges are acceptable,
we will provide selection sequence for decision-
makers. However, if the variations of the Pareto
points are not acceptable, we then go to the next
stage to tolerance design.
given x∗ ∈ P

Cost(∆x) (5)
subject to ∆f ≤∆fT
Equation 5 shows the constrained optimization
in tolerance design for each point in the Pareto set
P . The reasons all constraints g in Eq.(4) are re-
moved is due to the fact that tolerance reduction
will only ‘shrink’ the influences of uncertainties
on constraints and will not alter the feasibility
which is already robust. This method is inert to
the choice of cost model in Eq.(5) and in this work
we use exponential function from the literature.
After tolerance cost for each x∗ ∈ P to satisfy
∆fT is determined, it will become an additional
judgement for a design. Designers now have three
criteria in selecting their optimum, namely
Criterion 1 : how much tolerance cost to bring
the design to desired objective
ranges;
Criterion 2 : how well the objective perfor-
mances vary : influence area;
Criterion 3 : how well a design remains optimal
: signal-to-noise influence ratio.
If none of the existing Pareto points are accept-
able, more optimal alternatives are generated un-
til at least one is present. The proposed method

Figure 2: Pareto Set and Design Alternatives for

is general for single- and multi-level systems. Ad-
ditional challenges raised with multilevel systems
will be discussed in Section 3. In what follows, we
will use an example with two nonlinear objective
functions and two design variables and describe
each step in more details.
2.1 Pareto Generation and Uncer-
tainty Analysis
This step in Pareto generation and uncertainty
analysis involves Eqs.(1b-1e) given current design
tolerances ∆x and acceptable objective variation
ranges ∆fT in Eq.(1a). We use the bi-obejctive
optimization example in Eq.(6) with two design
variables as a demonstration of our proposed ap-
proach.
given {∆x = 0.01, ∆fT = [0.03, 0.1]}
min {f1 = R1 + R2, f2 = R1R2}
w.r.t x = [x1, x2]T (6)
s.t. max{g1 = 0.8X1 −X2 + 0.2} ≤ 0
max{g2 = −X1 + X2 − 1.6} ≤ 0
−1 ≤ X = [x±∆x] ≤ 1
R1 = −0.1 + (4− 2.1x21 + 0.25x41)x21
+x1x2 + (4x22 − 4)x22
R2 = (x1 − 1)2
The constraint method is used in generating
design alternatives on the Pareto set, resulting in
five Pareto points as shown in Fig.2. As can be
seen the Pareto set is concave, using weighted-
sum method will not get the complex Pareto set.
This constraint method in generating Pareto set
is also used for problems with multilevel struc-
tures. Since constraints in Eq.(6) are both linear,
worst case robustness can simply obtained using
interval arithmetic [28].
Variations of each design alternatives are ob-
tained using linearization with finite differences

optimality ‘signal’ and less ‘noise’ than scenario
A. The optimality influence range maintains the
functionality of OVR with better quantification of
the variations of a Pareto point in the objective
space.
Table 4 list the optimality influence ranges for
all design alternatives. Two important criteria
can be extracted from Table 4, namely the op-
timality influence area for the output variabili-
ties and the optimality influence signal-to-noise
ratio for the tendency to remain on the Pareto
set. These two criteria will be introduced in Sec-
tions 2.4 and 2.5.

E (−0.01, 1.00) (1.00, 0.01) 0.0289 0.0014
2.4 Influence Area
Area covered by the optimality influence range,
denoted as the influence area, is used to compare
two Pareto design alternatives. A design with
smaller influence area generally means smaller ob-
jective variation and preferred by designers. This
criteria can simply be computed using Eq.(2.4)
based on the influence range information in Ta-
ble 4.
influence area = ∆s×∆n
2.5 Signal-to-Noise Influence Ra-
tio
The unit vector ~s is defined as the signal direction
since variations along ~s tend to stay on the Pareto
set while variations along the noise vector ~n move
away from the Pareto set. With the signal and
noise unit vector being defined, we introduce the
optimality influence signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in
Eq.(2.5) as the third criterion in selecting design
alternatives.
influence S/N ratio =
∆s
∆n
Table 5 lists the influence area and S/N ratio
of all design alternatives A to E. As can be seen
Design B has the smallest influence area with the
largest S/N ratio. Design A, on the other hand,
has the largest influence area while E has the
worst signal-to-noise ration given the same input
variations. Figure 5 shows the influence range of
Design E. The variations in ∆x result in large ob-
jective variations in the noise direction, resulting
in a large influence area and poor S/N ratio. If
E is selected, one might expect a large portion of
design outcomes that are not ‘optimal’.

meet Eq.(6) are constructed. Decision-makers

Let us use the decomposed problem of Eq.(6)
and describe the challenges might encountered in
each step of our proposed method in Fig.1 when
integrating with ATC. Figure 9 shows the decom-
posed bi-level structure of Eq.(6) with one top
level supersystem and two lower level subsystems.
Responses between levels are R1 and R2. x1 is the
coupling variables between subsystems.

3.1 Pareto Set Generation
The constraint method in generating Pareto set
with all-in-one structure can be applied to the top
level of the decomposed system. Figure 10 shows
the ATC design alternatives with values in Ta-
ble 6 compared with the all-in-one Pareto set .
Although such an extensions can be straightfor-
ward, direct implementations might cause several
difficulties including
1. design alternatives obtained using ATC
might deviate from the all-in-one Pareto set
: theoretically ATC will yield identical re-
sults as undecomposed systems [30], small in-
consistency might cause large deviations be-
tween responses and result in unignorable de-
viations. Design D in Fig.10 shows such a
case. Although one might keep increasing
the inconsistency weights in D, the design
progression can be very slow.

using ATC
2. inconsistency might result in infeasible de-
sign alternatives : the choice on the weight-
ing update convergence tolerance is cru-
cial between obtaining a feasible design and
reaching an optimal solution. If weighting
update tolerance is very small, large weights
are required to reduce inconsistency result-
ing in slow design progressing of the entire
system toward the true optimum. On the
other hand, small weights comes from larger
acceptable convergence tolerance. High in-
consistency level will make design infeasible.
In this work we use 10−4 times the objec-
tive variation range as the weighting update
tolerance as a balance between inconsistency
and optimality.
3. objective function weights and inconsistency
weights needs to be assigned separately :
weights between objective functions result in
a single ‘composite’ objective that can be im-
plemented into Eq.(9). One should separate
these objective weights from inconsistency
weights since they have completely indepen-
dent functionality. Inconsistency weights are
assigned to obtain a convergent and consis-
tent design while objective weights are used
