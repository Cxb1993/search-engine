Abstract 
We consider the X -chart design for the quality 
measurements that follow an ARTA (Auto-regressive 
To Anything) process.  An optimization method to 
compute the sample size m and the number k of 
standard deviations away from the center line is 
proposed so that the out-of-control average run length 
(ARL) is minimized while maintaining the in-control 
ARL equal to a user-specified value.  Simulation 
results show that the optimal sample size increases 
nonmonotonically with the positive autocorrelations.     
Keywords: autocorrelated data, ARL, retrospective 
approximation, statistical design, X chart  
 
1. Introduction 
 
We consider the statistical design of X  control 
charts for an autocorrelated process ARTA 
(Auto-Regressive To Anything).  In designing an X  
control chart, two parameters---the sample size m of 
sample mean X , and the control-limit factor k (the 
number of standard deviations away from the center 
line)─must be determined.  In statistical design, these 
parameters are chosen so that the out-of-control 
average run length (ARL) is minimized under the 
constraint, i.e., maintaining the in-control ARL at a 
user-specified value. 
Conventional control charts in the traditional 
statistical process control (SPC) field consider that the 
quality characteristic X follows an independent and 
identical distribution.  In practice, the independent 
assumption may not be valid because most quality 
characteristic measurements are autocorrelated.  For 
example, the variance of the sample mean for 
positively autocorrelated data is larger than the 
variance for independent data.  Ignoring the 
autocorrelation would result in narrower control limits, 
and more false alarms.  Consequently, the 
independent assumption may have misleading results.     
In recent years, statistical process control for 
autocorrelated processes can be divided these 
literatures into two categories.  The methods in the 
first category use a time series model to fit the data, 
and then applying the traditional SPC charts to the 
stream of residuals, in other words, using residuals for 
plotting control chart points.  See Alwan and Roberts 
(1988), Wardell et al. (1994), Yashchin (1993), Runger 
et al. (1995), Lu and Reynolds (1999, 2001) and Tseng 
and Adams (1994).  The methods in the second 
category use the traditional SPC charts with modified 
control limits. See Vasilopous and Stamboulis (1978), 
Zhang (1998), and Jiang et al. (2000).  However, they 
focus on the control chart design for correlated normal 
data. Little literature has been devoted to control chart 
design for the correlated nonnormal data. 
We consider here the statistical design of X  
control charts under the assumption that the quality 
characteristic X follows an ARTA(p) process (Cario and 
Nelson, 1996 and 1998).  We present an optimization 
model to determine the values of m and k for 
minimizing the out-of-control ARL (average run length) 
while maintaining the in-control ARL at a 
user-specified value.

3. Simulation Results 
 
Here we show the performance of the proposed 
Shewhart X  chart design for four ARTA(1) processes 
with standard normal, t distribution with 5 degrees of 
freedom, exponential(1), and lognormal distribution 
with mean 1 and standard deviation 1.  When the 
marginal distribution is standard normal, the ARTA(1) 
is equivalent to the AR(1) process.  We denote the 
other three ARTA(1) process as ARTA(1) with t5, 
ARTA(1) with EXP(1), and ARTA(1) with 
lognormal(1,1).  The other three parameters are set as 
follows: the desired  value L = 1000, the shift 
δ 0
ARL
∈{.5, 1, 2}, and the ARTA(1) lag-1 autocorrelation 
ρ1∈{0, } for the first two processes and 
ρ
9.,5.,1. ±±±
1 ∈ {0, } for ARTA(1) with EXP(1), and 
ρ
8.,5.,1. ±±
1 ∈ {.9, .5, .1, 0, -.1, -.4} for ARTA(1) with 
lognormal(1,1).  It yields a total of 78 experiment 
points. Notice that the lowest possible lag-1 
autocorrelation for the exponential and lognormal(1,1) 
marginal distributions are -.645 and -.5 (Chen, 2001).     
The optimal values m* and k* satisfying Equation 
(1) are computed using the algorithm described in 
Section 2 for all the processes except the AR(1).  If 
the quality measurement follows an AR(1) process, the 
sample means ,...},{ 21 XX  follow an ARMA(1, 1) 
process (Kang and Schmeiser, 1987).  The ARL can 
therefore be computed using a two-dimensional 
Markov-chain approximation by Jiang et al. (2000).  
Hence, m* and k* can be computed numerically. 
The simulation results are listed in Table 1 for the 
first two processes and in Table 2 for the last two 
processes.  In Table 1, columns 1 and 2 list the values 
of ρ1 and δ ; columns 3 to 6 list the optimal values m* 
and k*, and the associated  and  for the 
AR(1) process; columns 7 to 10 list the optimal values 
m

* and k*, and the associated  and  for 
the ARTA(1) process with t

5 marginal distribution.  
Table 2 is similar to Table 1 except that columns 3 to 6 
are for the ARTA(1) with exponential(1) marginal 
distributions and columns 9 to 12 are for the ARTA(1) 
with lognormal marginal distribution.   
Tables 1 and 2 show the following findings: 
1. If 01 >ρ , the optimal sample size m* increases with 
1ρ .  When 1ρ  is large, Xσ  is large, the control 
limits are wide, and hence, it takes more chart points 
to detect an out-of-control signal.  
2. If 01 <ρ , m* may not change monotonically with 
1ρ .  This is because Xσ  is not a monotonic 
function of the sample size m when the 
autocorrelations ρ1, ρ2,... are not all positive.   
3. The values of m* and k* are sensitive to nonnormality.  
The values of m* and k* for nonnormal marginal 
distributions differ from the values for the normal 
marginal.  Ignoring nonnormality will result in not 
meeting the specified  value, having a higher 
, or both.
