 The most real systems are nonlinear. Many real systems are stochastic. In general, complex 
and micro systems are always described by nonlinear stochastic systems. In this principal project, 
we focus on the nonlinear stochastic theory and its applications to non-conventional control 
systems. The conditions of four sub-projects are as follows. The first sub-project has applied 
nonlinear stochastic system identification method to construct the dynamic model of archery 
systems to improve the stability and robustness of archery systems. There are several published 
results in this topic. In the second sub-project, a fuzzy adaptive control of nonlinear stochastic 
system is developed for the control of wireless networks. In the third sub-project, the decision 
making problem, which maximizes a cost function from a partially known sequence of future 
trend, is investigated. It is crucial to identify the future evolution of the portfolio composition in 
financial systems. In the fourth sub-project, we investigate the robust output feedback tracking 
control of quantum systems under disturbances. A quantum observer is used to estimate the state 
variable of quantum system for quantum control to track a desired reference signal. This will be 
potential for quantum information and quantum communication in the future.

Since the most systems are nonlinear and many real systems are uncertain and stochastic, 
nonlinear stochastic systems get more and more attention. In general, nonlinear stochastic 
systems can be used in modeling, control, estimation and decision of many non-conventional 
systems. Nonlinear stochastic systems can be used in modeling of archery system in order to 
improve the muscle strength stability of the expertise archers. Nonlinear stochastic systems can 
be suitable for filtering and control of wireless network. Nonlinear stochastic systems can be used 
in the prediction, investment and planning of the financial system. Nonlinear stochastic systems 
can be employed in the tracking control of stochastic quantum systems in the micro-world which 
has great potential application to quantum computations and the designs of quantum 
communications. Therefore, the nonlinear stochastic theory can be applied to the practical design 
of various non-conventional control systems.

The objective of each sub-project is as follows. 
THE FIRST SUB-PROJECT: Modeling of nonlinear stochastic system and its 
application to archery-Intended aiming adjustment analysis based on the ARX part 
of ARMAX model (Chi-Kuang Hwang) 
In this study, nonlinear stochastic system identification method has been used to construct 
the dynamic model of archery systems in order to improve the stability and robustness of archery 
systems. ARMAX is adopted to model the aiming trajectory for each shot associated with each 
archer. We then define related variables for identifying their role upon the performance. The 
direct effect on the performance related to these variables will be analyzed. The Hamming 
window is implemented to recovery the desired and anticipated adjustments of archers. 
Correlation method is designed to obtain the individual and grouping characteristics. 
 
THE SECOND SUB-PROJECT: Fuzzy Adaptive Control of Nonlinear Stochastic 
System and Its Applications to Wireless Network (Bore-Kuen Lee) 
In this study, we want to attack the weighted adaptive minimum variance control for 
stochastic T-S fuzzy ARMAX models which can be applied to wireless network. Under the direct 
adaptive control scheme, the weighted minimum variance control is applied to find the control 
law to make adaptive control system stable in the sense of mean square stability. 
 
THE THIRD SUB-PROJECT: Fuzzy Decision for Unknown Dynamic Systems: A 
Portfolio Example (Kuang-Yow Lian) 
Considering a system with unknown dynamics, we investigate the decision making problem 
which maximizes a cost function from a partially known sequence of future trend. After set up the 
framework of such an optimization problem, we focus on how to determine an optimal sequence

deceleration occur as a result of learning, and (b) these heart rates and electroencephalograph 
(EEG) patterns are related to archery performance. The electromyography (EMG) technology 
which measures the activation patterns in forearm muscles related to contraction and relaxation 
strategy during archery shooting, has been applied by Ertan et al., [3] to analyze for archers with 
different levels of expertise; elite, beginner, and non-archers, respectively. They found that elite 
archers’ release started about 100 ms after the fall of the clicker, whereas for beginners and 
non-archers, their release started after about 200 and 300 ms, respectively. How the novice 
archers apply the taught training information under different conditions and guided them to 
promote their motor skills required for better archery performance have investigated by Lavisse 
et al. [4].  
The aiming stability is the key factor affects the archery performance has been indicated by 
Shiang et al. [5], and it can be determined by the size of aiming locus. They further pointed out 
that the aiming locus pattern is also a useful index to determine the performance. The effects of 
heart variable rate (HVR) related to the stability of archer has been measured by C.-T. Lo. [6]. By 
the frequency domain analysis of the HVR and three main frequency domains, such as very low 
frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and high frequency (HF). The VLF component is much 
less defined and the HF generally represents parasympathetic activity. The LF is influenced by 
both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and the ratio of HF to LF represents the balance 
of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity. The results showed that the HF was higher, the LF 
was lower, and the LF/HF ratio was lower for the best performance.  
Analysis of correlation between the aiming adjustment trajectory and the shot points has 
been studied [7] by Lin et al. Aiming trajectory can be modeled as a nonlinear stochastic system. 
The desired aiming adjustment is modeled as the deterministic but nonlinear part, and the muscle 
strength stability is modeled as the stochastic part. Several linear aggressive moving average with 
an exogenous input (ARMAX) models to represent the nonlinear part via the T-S fuzzy scheme. 
Thus, the important knowledge base for the T-S fuzzy model is needed to obtain from these linear 
ARMAX models.

The research method of each sub-project is as follows. 
THE FIRST SUB-PROJECT: Modeling of nonlinear stochastic system and its 
application to archery-Intended aiming adjustment analysis based on the ARX part 
of ARMAX model (Chi-Kuang Hwang) 
A nonlinear stochastic system associated with archery can be separated into two parts, that is, 
the nonlinear part related to the desired aiming adjustment and the stochastic part associated with 
the muscle strength stability. The T-S fuzzy model is then adopted to combine the several linear 
aggressive moving average with an exogenous input (ARMAX) models to represent the nonlinear 
part. In other words, the ARMAX is adopted to model the aiming trajectory recorded during the 
last 1.5 second before releasing the arrow. Thus, the important knowledge base for the T-S fuzzy 
model is attempted to obtain from these linear ARMAX models based on each archer for 
analyzing his archery performance. Through the statistic correlation approach, the individual and 
grouping characteristics are obtained from it. During that 1.5 period, the desired adjustments of 
archers without considering their muscle strength are the main interest in this paper. For expertise 
archers, their desired aiming style should not contain high frequency which is corresponding 
negative pole of the model. Therefore, a Hamming window is implemented to remove the high

Quantum Systems under Disturbances (Bor-Sen Chen) 
In this study, based on the state space dynamic model, a robust output feedback tracking 
design for quantum systems is proposed so that the effects of uncertainties due to modeling errors, 
the initial state of the system and external disturbances, on the tracking error should be below a 
desired level, i.e., the gain from these uncertainties to the tracking error of a quantum system 
should be less than a prescribed value for some control purpose. The robust output feedback 
tracking control design is employed to attenuate the effect of uncertainties or disturbances to 
achieve a less sensitive tracking control in the quantum systems. In order to achieve the control 
design purpose with uncertainty attenuation and disturbance rejection in quantum tracking 
systems, we need to solve a min-max tracking problem with the worst-case (maximum) effect of 
disturbances on the tracking performance to be minimized. It will be shown that our robust output 
feedback quantum tracking problem is equivalent to a min-max (game) control problem, which 
needs to solve a Bellman-Isaacs equation from the dynamic game perspective. 
Therefore, the robust tracking control problem in quantum systems becomes the problem of 
how to solve a Hamilton Jacobi equation (HJE). However, it is generally not easy to solve this 
nonlinear partial differential HJE. For the convenience of design, a tensor formal power series 
method is employed to solve the HJE. Because the tensor formal power series converges quickly, 
it could approximate the robust tracking design satisfactorily with only the first few terms. In the 
open loop control case, the quantum control is obtained by a computational feedback simulation. 
The feedback system simulated by a computer, within which there are a model to represent the 
quantum mechanical system and a control law, enforces the control with an open loop on the 
actual quantum mechanical system. Tracking control signal u(t) is generated by the controller 
using the information on tracking error to make the state x(t) of a quantum system track a desired 
state xd(t) robustly. In the closed loop feedback control case, a continuous quantum measurement 
is needed for output feedback control. The spin interacts with an optical mode, which is measured 
continuously by homodyne detection. With this measurement, a magnetic field is used for 
feedback control to steer the state of quantum system to a desired state.

The most popular aggressive moving average with an exogenous input (ARMAX) has been

recorded trajectories have been processed to represent the last 1.5 second before releasing the 
arrow. Variables defined from the model are utilized to identify their roles affecting the

the related one-step-ahead predictor. Under the direct adaptive control scheme, weighted

Simulation study is also made to verify the developed results.

THE THIRD SUB-PROJECT: Fuzzy Decision for Unknown Dynamic Systems: A 
Portfolio Example (Kuang-Yow Lian) 
We propose the decision models for asset allocation of portfolio with good performance of 
investment, and use MATLAB software to solve the models. The proposed models developed 
based on the well-known mean-variance Markowitz portfolio model include (i) the mixed ones of 
BS model and CRR model with F-Markowitz portfolio model, and (ii) a new one derived from 
dynamic systems using decision making approach. The first experiment indicates the 
performance of Portfolio Dynamics Model, which is best than other models, not only apply in 
different risk aversion factors, but also fit for short-time and long-time investments. The second 
experiment shows the suitability of membership functions of proposed fuzzy decision in different 
time lengths and different time points.  
Finally, there are three research issues can be focused in the future works. firstly, 
considering other constraints of real market, like transaction costs; secondly, using other heuristic 
algorithms to regulate the membership functions in a smart way; and thirdly, verifying the 
performance of proposed model in a real market. 
 
The achievement of the third sub-project is as follows.
