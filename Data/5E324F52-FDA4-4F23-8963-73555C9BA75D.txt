the acceptor atom were previously studied via 
2D and simulations in the ideal double-gate 
nFETs (Fig. 1) [7]. The discrete impurity dopant 
fluctuation could cause unacceptable variation in 
threshold voltage and drain-induced barrier 
lowering (DIBL) with only the single acceptor 
atom existing at different locations in the 
channel of nFETs (Fig. 2a) [7] and hence tight 
control of doping profile is necessary, especially 
in extremely scaled devices. Furthermore, the 
donor atoms in source/drain regions of the nFET 
could diffuse into the channel and the introduced 
fluctuation effects could be more noticeable in 
undoped or lightly-doped channel devices (Fig. 
2b).  
For practical consideration, using the 
multi-fin configuration to achieve higher drive 
current would be more of interest. Given that 
each of the fins has its own statistical variation, 
it is essential to perform a more comprehensive 
analysis. In this work, we examine the impurity 
dopant fluctuation effects quantitatively based 
on a 3D numerical study for the multi-fin 
configurations and we also compare their 
impacts on the double-gate, FinFET, and 
triple-gate devices. Finally, design insight of 
various multi-fin structures accounting for 
threshold voltage variation is presented. 
IV. 3D macroscopic modeling methodology 
An efficient macroscopic modeling 
methodology is used in our study to gain insight 
into spatial dopant fluctuation in the advanced 
MOSFETs. We divided the MOSFET channel 
into many cubes of equal volume of l3 where l is 
the length/width of the cube [8], as shown in Fig. 
1. By assuming that one impurity dopant is 
located in one of the cubes, the corresponding 
doping (NA) is 6.4× 1019 cm-3 within the assigned 
cube with l of 2.5 nm.  
The 3D structures used for simulations are 
shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the latter of which can be 
simply converted to a triple-gate one with equal 
oxide thickness around the gate. To ensure that 
the channel can be divided into cubes, the film 
thickness (tSi) and channel length(L)/width(W) 
are in multiple of l’s (e.g. for the double-gate 
case, L = 25 nm and tSi (W) = 12.5 nm, the 
channel is divided into 10× 5× 5 cubes.). For a 
single cube in the channel containing one 
impurity atom while all other are left undoped, 
the equivalent impurity density for the whole 
channel region is 2.56× 1017 cm-3. 
Numerical simulations were carried out for 
the double-gate, FinFET, and triple-gate 
nMOSFETs (L = and 25 nm, tox (gate oxide) = 
1.3 nm, and tSi = 12.5 nm), which were designed 
to meet the criteria defined in the ITRS roadmap 
[5]. In our simulations, Fermi-Dirac statistics 
and drift-diffusion transport with modified local 
density approximation for carrier confinement, 
concentration dependent mobility, Lombardi 
surface mobility, and Caughey-Thomas 
field-dependent mobility were included [9].  
Fig. 4 shows the predicted Ion versus Ioff for 
a single discrete acceptor dopant at all respective 
locations in the double-gate, FinFET, and 
triple-gate n-channel devices, each of which has 
250 cases. As can be seen, all the three types of 
devices have similar Ion - Ioff distributions, 
implying similar sensitivity to doping fluctuation. 
Since the simulation results are only for a single 
fin of the FinFET or triple-gate FET, we will 
re-examine the impurity dopant fluctuation 
effects for the multi-fin configurations which are 
very common in actual design, as shown in Fig. 
5.

二、與會心得： 
從會議中的討論可以發現，當元件持續微縮時，一些極小元件所具有的特性及潛在
問題逐漸浮現，如短通道效應、閘極穿隧電流、量子效應等卻伴隨而生，其中因短通道效
應所造成的通道漏電流對元件特性影響甚為深遠，是我們所相當關切且極欲解決的主要問
題，如要有效的控制短通道效應，單運用傳統的電晶體架構並不易達成，必需使用不同的
結構來改善，如雙閘極和三閘極場效電晶體。 
三閘極場效電晶體的矽本體基本上是維持在完全空乏的情況，所以還具有類似雙閘
極電晶體的耦合效應，並與掩埋的氧化層(buried oxide)形成另一完全空乏型 SOI 場效
電晶體。一個元件由三個閘極控制，同時具有雙閘極及完全空乏型 SOI 的特性，而通道
的總寬度是三個閘極寬度的總和，很明顯的它能提供額外的驅動電流。另外因多了上層閘
極，它對矽本體厚度的要求(為了達到抑制短通道效應的目的)並不像鰭式場效電晶體
(FinFET)所限定的那麼薄，在製作上可行性也相當高。 
正因三閘極場效電晶體本身亦有待克服的問題，如何獲得較佳的三閘極場效電晶體
成為一重要課題。筆者發表的論文主要研究如何運用透過不同的 n+/p+型閘極以獲得不同
臨界電壓，不需要新穎的金屬閘極，採用傳統的多晶矽即可達成。筆者於發表論文過程期

附件: 筆者於此研討會發表之論文。 
We first assess the device I-V characteristics for the three gate structures, as 
compared with the mid-gap metal-gate device using a 3D numerical tool [7]. All the 
devices (nFETs) have the same L of 25 nm, Tox of 1.3 nm, and thick buried oxide of 
200 nm. In the simulations, Fermi-Dirac statistics, modified local density 
approximation for carrier confinement, and drift-diffusion transport model with field-
dependent mobility were used. Fig. 3 shows the simulated IDS vs. VGS characteristics 
for the proposed structure (a) and mid-gap metal-gate device with comparable Ioff 
(~50 nA/µm) set at VDS = 1.1 V. To achieve the equal Ioff value, a channel doping 
density of 7x1018 cm-3 is needed for the proposed structure, whereas an undoped body 
is used for the near-mid-gap metal-gate device. Due to higher mobility in the undoped 
channel, the mid-gap metal-gate device gives higher Ion (@VGS = VDS = 1.1 V). On 
the other hand, the proposed device exhibits better DIBL characteristics due to the 
higher vertical field attained by the positive back-gate filed in the asymmetrical 
device configuration as well as the use of the doped body. The proposed structures 
with different n+/p+ polysilicon gate offsets are compared in Fig. 4, which shows the 
simulated IDS vs. VGS characteristics for the three cases shown in Fig. 2. The same 
channel doping density (7x1018 cm-3) is used. Case (b) with larger p+-polysilicon 
portion has the highest VT, whereas case (c) with larger n+-polysilicon portion has the 
lowest VT. Fig. 5 further shows the Ion vs. Ioff characteristics for the three poly-gate 
and the metal-gate devices. The three proposed structures offer a wide range of VT 
selection, thus multiple VT can be made.  
 
The detailed device characteristics are listed in Table 1. The DIBL values of the 
proposed cases are much lower than that of the metal-gate device. Fig. 6 shows the 
inversion carrier distribution in the channel. The electron density is more uniformly 
distributed for the mid-gap metal-gate device, while it is crowded near the n+-gate 
surface for the proposed structure (a) (results for structures (b) and (c) are not shown, 
yet similar). Hence, the proposed structures have improved DIBL’s, as the carriers are 
better controlled due to the higher field perpendicular to the predominant n+-gate. 
 
Fig. 7 shows the Ion and Ioff sensitivities to VDD. As expected, Ioff for structure (a) is 
slightly less sensitive than that of the mid-gap metal-gate device due to less DIBL. 
The Ion dependences on VDD are similar for the three proposed structures, implying 
consistent dynamic power scaling when these structures are integrated on the same 
chip for multi-VT design. The DIBL advantage is further reflected in Fig. 8. To gain 
insight into CMOS circuit speed performance, we also simulated C-V characteristics, 
as shown in Fig. 9, for CV/I comparison. The CV/Ion value of our proposed structure 
(case (a)) is about 50% (at VDD of 1.1V) higher than that of the mid-gap metal-gate 
one mainly due to lower Ion. However, as VDD is decreased, the gate capacitance for 
the proposed scheme decreases faster and hence it is more suitable for low-voltage 
applications. 
3 Conclusion 
A novel TG MOSFET structure using asymmetrical polysilicon gates is proposed. 
Due to the superior SCEs, the proposed TG device offers better channel length 
scalability compared with TG devices with near-mid-gap metal-gates.  By changing 
the patterns/offsets of the n+/p+ polysilicon gates, multiple VT can be achieved. Hence, 
this structure can be used in low-power high-performance VLSI.
