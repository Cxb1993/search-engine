2the quality of use in a context. ISO 9241-10 (1996) indicated that communication principles cannot be used
for design or evaluation without first identifying the context of use. Mobile devices are frequently used while
the user is in ambulatory contexts, in contrast to the stationary desktop computing. Accordingly, it is important
to evaluate the appropriateness of utilizing RSVP displays for small screen reading in both stationary and
ambulatory contexts. Consequently, this study examined RSVP display selection factors that might affect
reading comprehension of Chinese text on a small screen in stationary and ambulatory contexts.
1.1 Underlying factors of an RSVP display
RSVP display was introduced by Forster (1970) to study the comprehension and processing of written
language. It was later applied to computer screens (Aaronson and Scarborough 1977). The advantage of RSVP
displays was presumed to be the elimination of eye movements, which would lead to a possible reduction in
cognitive load (Potter 1984). Several parameters may vary in RSVP displays. Previous studies investigating
the effects of different dynamic display factors on reading Chinese RSVP displays have demonstrated that
presentation unit and presentation duration had the greatest effects on reading comprehension (Wang and Kan
2004, Chen and Chien 2007, Chien et al. 2008).
The central characteristic of RSVP displays is a segmented presentation of text at an automatic pace. The
presentation unit has to do with how texts are segmented for presentation, and presentation duration has to do
with the time allotted to presentation of each Chinese character. Wang and Kan (2004) performed a dual task
experiment that examined the influence of an RSVP display on comprehension performance in reading static
and dynamic presentations of Chinese text on a15’LCD display. Their study involved presenting Chinese text
using RSVP display with a presentation unit of one line formatted to display 20 characters at a time. The
results indicated that the optimal speed for RSVP presentation of text was approximately 140 characters per
minute (cpm), which is about 429 msC-1 (60/140). However, Chen and Chien (2007) investigated the effects
of different RSVP displays on Chinese reading performance in accomplishing both a static search task and a
RSVP reading task using the small screen of smart phone. The results of their study indicated that both
word-by-word and one-line presentation units can be used with a shorter presentation duration of 171 msC-1
on the screen of a smart phone. Chien et al. (2008) conducted a Chinese RSVP study to investigate the effects
of different RSVP displays on Chinese reading performance in accomplishing dual tasks of a dynamic
text-reading task and a mental arithmetic task with a small wristwatch screen. Similar to the earlier study, the
results showed that the word-by-word presentation at 171 msC-1 duration could be used for reading RSVP
display information.
Consideration of the feasibility of optimizing the reading of Chinese text using RSVP displays on the
screens of mobile devices under ambulatory contexts should include the effects of various combinations of
presentation units and presentation durations on reading comprehension.
1.2 Evaluation of ambulatory contexts
Many products exhibit high levels of usability during laboratory evaluations, but this is not always the
case when they are transferred to the real world (Whiteside et al. 1988). Mobile devices are typically used in
highly dynamic contexts that exert great demands on both working memory and visuo-spatial resources
(Garden et al. 2002). Surprisingly, a large number of studies on mobile computing ignore the context of use
that is relevant to the user. Kjeldskov and Graham (2003) reviewed 102 mobile human–computer interaction
(HCI) research papers published between 2000 and 2002 and found that 71% of mobile device evaluation was
done through laboratory experiments, and only 19% through field studies. To be applicable to real-world
situations, the evaluations of mobile device usability should be done with consideration of the contexts in
which they are used.
The essential characteristic of context in mobile computing is using mobile devices while one is in
motion. Indeed, walking while using a mobile device is a common activity. The use of mobile devices entails
two fundamental categories of actions: retrieving the information shown on the screen (output) and entering
information into the device (e.g., commanding, tapping, or navigating). To date, many mobile computing
studies have been devoted to developing an efficient means for input-oriented actions in ambulatory contexts.
In contrast, to our knowledge, few studies have systematically examined the possible effects of ambulatory
contexts on users’ ability to retrieve text(Mustonen et al. 2004; Barnard et al. 2005; Vadas et al. 2006;
Barnard et al. 2007).
Mustonen et al. (2004) evaluated alternative methods of using normal reading and pseudo-text search,
using these as visual tasks for studying the legibility of static-page format text while subjects were walking on
4design. All variables were treated as within-subjects variables. In total, 24 stimuli were used in the formal
experiment.
Figure 1. Demonstration of the two presentation units: (a) word-by-word and (b) single-line displays.
2.2 Participants
Given that young people, especially college and university students, would be the major readers of text
information presented via mobile phones, 30 native Chinese-speaking university or graduate students
volunteered to take part in the study. Their ages were between 19 and 26 years (M = 23.3); 13 were males and
17 were females. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
2.3 Apparatus and materials
A mobile phone (Sony Ericsson Z610i) with a 2-in Thin Film Diode (TFD) display was used for stimulus
presentation. Macromedia Flash MX software was used to generate stimuli. A Body-Solid XT 7600 treadmill
was used for the treadmill scenario.
Eight unrelated passages were used for practice, and 24 different passages were used for the formal
experiment, which used a 3 (type of context) × 2 (presentation unit) × 4 (presentation duration) mixed design.
All passages were extracted from the Chinese edition of the digital magazine Cheers. The passages were
selected based on criteria that they have no rare words, no proper place names, and no technical terms or
names of unusual instruments. The mean passage length, including punctuation marks, was 136 characters,
with a range of 119 to 156 characters. Chinese characters were presented in 12-point true type font, which is
the default font frequently used to present Chinese characters on small screen device displays. In constructing
the reading comprehension questions and possible answers, care was taken to ensure that a participant could
not readily answer the questions without prior reading of the passage. The levels of difficulty of the passages
and the reading comprehension tasks were checked in a pilot study using a focus group of 10 participants of
similar educational background to the participants to ensure that the passages and questions were neither too
easy nor too difficult to understand and answer.
2.4 Procedure
Before the experiment began, participants were informed of the aim of the tests, and they performed
eight practice trials to become familiar with the experimental set-up and the characteristics of the mobile
phone display. Following a 2-min rest period, the experiment began. Participants had to read a total of 24
passages in three different contexts (seated, walking on the treadmill, and walking through the outdoor course).
First, participants were randomly assigned to a context and were instructed to read and comprehend eight
passages sequentially. Following a 5-min rest period, participants were examined with another eight passages
in the second context. Finally, the remaining eight passages were tested in the third context. Participants were
asked to do their best to understand the meaning of the passages. After reading the passage, three
multiple-choice questions related to the passage content were displayed. Each question was presented
individually. The multiple-choice questions were presented in the same sequence for all participants. For each
6and 213 msC-1 (M = 2.74, SE = 0.11). Figure 2 shows the effect of presentation duration on reading
comprehension while reading passages presented in a one-line format.

4 Discussion
The current study was designed to evaluate whether the RSVP display factors of presentation unit and
presentation duration, which have shown significant effects on reading comprehension in previous studies,
have the same effects in ambulatory contexts. Moreover, the current study was aimed at examining whether an
RSVP display could provide an alternative to a static display considering ambulatory contexts. As a result,
design guidelines for optimized RSVP display are discussed based on the results of the objective measures
used in the current study. The results of this study are partially consistent to the results of previous Chinese
RSVP studies conducted by Chen and Chien (2007) and Chien et al. (2008). The results of this study differ
from those reported by Wang and Kan (2004).
The results of the studies by Chen and Chien (2007) and Chien et al. (2008) indicated that the
word-by-word presentations can be used to display RSVP text on the screen of a mobile device using a shorter
presentation duration of 171 msC-1. The present study confirmed these results and added the extra
consideration of ambulatory contexts. However, Chen and Chien (2007) indicated that the one-line
presentation unit can also be used under a stationary, seated condition for reading RSVP text on the screen of
a smart phone with the shorter presentation duration of 171 msC-1. This result is not consistent with ours. In
an ambulatory condition, when the presentation unit was a one-line format, reading comprehension
deteriorated with the shortest presentation duration, 171 msC-1, and the longer presentation duration, of 213
msC-1 was necessary for good comprehension. Accordingly, a word-by-word format should be the first choice
for presenting RSVP display information on the small screen of mobile devices. By using a word-by-word
format, users can read RSVP display information faster with a quite short presentation duration of 171 msC-1
without significantly degrading the reading comprehension. This brief 171-msC-1 presentation duration is
about 19.7% shorter than the standard duration of 213 msC-1 (Chan and Lee 2005) for reading static Chinese
text on computer displays. The reason that reading performance is accelerated with a word-by-word
presentation unit might be as follows. In the one-line format, Chinese text was presented as a continuous
string of characters without conventional demarcations of word boundaries. Therefore, readers were required,
first, to use part of their cognitive resources to divide the characters into the smallest meaningful units, and
then they had to proceed to the further task of reading comprehension. However, a segmented text
presentation using a word-by-word format helped readers to divide the string of characters into words in
advance. The characteristic of segmentation provides readers with perceptual cues for lexical access and saves
their cognitive resources, thereby enhancing reading comprehension. Consequently, divisions between words
in a text are essential for reading dynamically displayed text to eliminate the extra processing and cognitive
8years. They were assumed to possess larger memory capacities than elderly individuals. However, given that
mobile phones are widespread and commonly available, all mobile phone applications should be easy to use
by everyone, including elderly individuals. It may be important to further investigate the effect of age (e.g.,
young vs. elderly people) on reading dynamically displayed information. Additionally, the test passages used
in this study, which included an average of 136 Chinese characters, were quite short, compared with formats
such as email or e-books. Öquist and Goldstein (2003) reported that reading long fictional texts with an
English RSVP display may increase the task load significantly. Consequently, we need to conduct further
investigations to design a Chinese RSVP display that would be optimal for reading longer text information.

This study investigated the effects of presentation unit and presentation duration on the
comprehension for reading Chinese text on the small screen of a mobile phone in three different
contexts (seated, walking on a treadmill, and walking through an outdoor course). Thirty readers
participated in this study. In each of the three contexts, participants read eight passages that were
dynamically presented with various combinations of presentation units (word-by-word or single
line) and presentation durations (171, 213, 240, and 308 milliseconds per character (msC-1)).
Results showed that presentation unit and presentation duration significantly affected reading
comprehension, and interactions between factors were also significant. When the presentation unit
was word-by-word, no significant difference in reading comprehension was observed under
different presentation durations. However, when the presentation unit was a single line, reading
comprehension deteriorated with the shortest presentation duration of 171 msC-1. With regard to
context, participants had a higher mean reading comprehension score in the seated context than in
ambulatory contexts, but the difference was not significant. Recommendations for appropriate
dynamic display design for presenting Chinese characters on the screen of mobile devices based
on the results of objective measures are discussed.
Introduction
The year-on-year growth in numbers of mobile phone subscribers has resulted largely from the
convenience of using mobile devices to make/receive calls and to access information anywhere at anytime.
With regard to retrieving information via mobile devices, most users receive and read text information, such
as emails, news, instant messages, and e-books, on a daily basis (Chen and Chien, 2007). Text information is
usually displayed on the screen of mobile devices is in a static form, similar to a page format. However, the
screen size of mobile devices is extremely small, and only a limited amount of information is visible at one
time using a static text presentation. Prior studies showed that rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) displays,
which dynamically exhibit temporal instead of spatial information, can overcome the limitations of small
screen size (for examples in English, see Kang and Muter,1989, Juola et al., 1995, Rahman and Muter, 1999,
Castelhano and Muter, 2001; for examples in Chinese, see Chen and Chien, 2007, Chien et al., 2008). RSVP
display entails a segmented presentation of a text in units of one or more words at a time at a fixed location on
a screen and at a computer-controlled pace. Although an RSVP display presents usability advantages in
efficiently displaying information on the small screen of mobile devices, most studies have evaluated RSVP
displays in stationary desktop-like situations. It is important that mobile devices are not tested only in
stationary scenarios, as many potential problems may be missed. Bevan and Macleod (1994) have mentioned
that usability has to do with the quality of use in a context. Mobile devices are frequently used while the user
is in ambulatory contexts, in contrast to the stationary desktop computing. Accordingly, it is important to
evaluate the appropriateness of utilizing RSVP displays for small screen reading in both stationary and
ambulatory contexts.
The advantage of RSVP displays was presumed to be the elimination of eye movements, which would
lead to a possible reduction in cognitive load (Potter, 1984). Several parameters may vary in RSVP displays.
Previous studies that presentation unit and presentation duration had the greatest effects on reading

segmented presentation of text at an automatic pace. The presentation unit has to do with how texts are
segmented for presentation, and presentation duration has to do with the time allotted to presentation of each
Chinese character. Consequently, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of the presentation duration
and presentation unit of RSVP displays on users’ comprehension of material presented on smal screens of 
mobile devices during stationary and ambulatory scenarios.

The presentation units, word-by-word and single line, resulted in mean comprehension scores of 2.58 and
2.49, respectively. The participants had significantly higher reading comprehension scores for the
word-by-word than for the one-line format (F(1, 29) = 4.373, p < 0.05).
Presentation duration significantly afected participants’ reading comprehension (F(3,87) = 9.223, p <
0.01). For presentation durations of 308, 240, 213, and 171 msC-1, the mean comprehension scores were 2.57,
2.60, 2.63, and 2.35, respectively. Multiple comparisons with the least significant difference (LSD) method
based on estimated marginal means showed that the presentation duration of 171 msC-1 was associated with
lower reading comprehension score compared to durations of 308, 240, or 213 msC-1.
The different contexts did not significantly affect reading comprehension. The mean comprehension
scores did not differ significantly among seated (2.58), walking on a treadmill (2.58), and walking through an
outdoor course (2.46).
Other than the significant interaction of presentation unit × presentation duration (F(3,87) ＝ 14.447, p
< 0.01), no other significant interactions were found. When the presentation unit was word-by-word, no
significant difference in reading comprehension was observed under different presentation durations. However,
when the presentation unit was a single line, the reading comprehension deteriorated under the shortest
presentation duration of 171 msC-1.
Discussion
The current study was designed to evaluate whether the RSVP display factors of presentation unit and
presentation duration, which have shown significant effects on reading comprehension in previous studies,
have the same effects in ambulatory contexts. Moreover, the current study was aimed to examine whether an
RSVP display could provide an alternative to a static display considering ambulatory contexts. As a result,
design guidelines for optimized RSVP display are discussed based on the results of the objective measures
used in the current study.
The results of present study showed that presentation unit and presentation duration significantly affected
reading comprehension, and interactions between factors were also significant. When the presentation unit
was word-by-word, no significant difference in reading comprehension was observed under different
presentation durations. However, when the presentation unit was a single line, reading comprehension
deteriorated with the shortest presentation duration of 171 msC-1. Accordingly, a word-by-word format should
be the first choice for presenting RSVP display information on the small screen of mobile devices. By using a
word-by-word format, users can read RSVP display information faster with quite short presentation duration
of 171 msC-1 without significantly degrading the reading comprehension. This brief 171 msC-1 presentation
duration is about 19.7% shorter than the standard duration of 213 msC-1 (Chan and Lee, 2005) for reading
static Chinese text on computer displays. The reason that reading performance is accelerated with a
word-by-word presentation unit might be as follows. In the on-line format, Chinese text was presented as a
continuous string of characters without conventional demarcations of word boundaries. Therefore, readers
were required, first, to use part of their cognitive resources to divide the characters into the smallest
meaningful units, and then they had to proceed to the further task of reading comprehension. However, a
segmented text presentation using a word-by-word format helped readers to divide the string of characters into
words in advance. The characteristic of segmentation provides readers perceptual cues for lexical access and
saves their cognitive resources, thereby enhancing reading comprehension. Consequently, divisions between
words in a text are essential for reading dynamically displayed text to eliminate the extra processing and
cognitive load needed for word segmentation. In contrast to the word-by-word presentation unit, in the case of

This study examined the effects of message framing (gain and loss) and character/background
color combination (a red background with white characters and a white background with black
characters) on participants’ perception of promoting materials and hence their willingness to
receive the vaccine when they read the materials on the H1N1 Flu. A 2 × 2 between subjects
experiment was used. 120 university students participated in the study. Results of the study show
that participants are more interested and can better understand and tend to believe vaccine
information presented through loss-framed messages, and loss-framed messages in combination
with a white background with black characters will increase participants’ wilingness to receive 
the vaccine. Practical application of the two factors in the development of effective health
promoting materials is discussed.
Introduction
H1N1 influenza was reported again in Taiwan’s military recruit training center in May 2010. Soldiers 
who contracted the influenza were between 19 and 24 years of age, and this age group had the lowest rate of
inoculation in Taiwan. Only 3.6 % of people ages 19 to 24 years received the shot (Central Epidemic
Command Center, 2010). To prevent H1N1 influenza from becoming pandemic again and to educate this
population on the importance of vaccination against the influenza, proactive efforts should be devoted to the
design of various vaccine promoting materials. Fedson (1994) stated that the failure to effectively enrich the
general public with knowledge of related medical information was the cause for the low acceptance of
vaccination. It is important to increase the general public’s interest in the health information through media or
other routes and public promoting materials may be a good way to successfuly enhance people’s wilingness 
to accept health information and be inoculated with the vaccine.
It was mentioned in past studies that when designing medical care and health information promoting
materials, message framing (Gerend and Shepherd, 2007; Gerend, Shepherd, and Monday, 2008; Gerend and
Sias, 2009) and color priming (Elliot, Maier, Moller, Friedman, and Meinhardt, 2007; Elliot and Niesta, 2008;
Gerend and Sias, 2009) were two factors that would subconsciously affect people’s perception and willingness
to accept communicated information.
Regarding the factor of message framing, gain framing can be applied to related content of the promoted
health information to encourage health seeking positively or loss framing negatively. However, different
message framings will affect decision-making, which is referred to as the framing effect. The
above-mentioned framing effect is developed from the prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981), which
describes that people’s decision making varies with how an issue is presented and hence the content of 
decision-making will be different, too. According to the theory, when people focus on potential gains, they
avoid risks or facing uncertainty. Rather, they choose a definite gain over a potentially uncertain gain.
However, when focusing on a loss, people are more likely to accept risk and uncertainty when the risk
includes the possibility of avoiding a loss.
Regarding the factor of character/background color combination, color is an important factor to attract
attention and it also subconsciously afects people’s decision-making process (Elliot et al., 2007; Elliot and
Niesta, 2008; Gerend and Sias, 2009). In a medical setting, red can be threatening (Wogalter, Conzola, and
Smith-Jackson, 2002) and psychologically, red is linked to blood, injuries, infection, physical hazards, and
warning signs (Gerend and Sias, 2009). Studies on the correlation among color priming (red and gray),
message framing (gain and loss) and willingness to receive the HPV vaccine found that when the color red
was applied in a loss-framed message, participants would be more inclined to be vaccinated (Gerend and Sias,
2009).
Consequently, this study explores if the two factors, message framing and character/background color
information content, the questionnaire also consisted of three questions, namely (a) your interest aroused by
the vaccine information, (b) easiness to understand the vaccine information, and (c) believe of the vaccine
information.
Results
Regarding the Survey on willingness to receive vaccine, results of the analysis showed that when
participants answered the question “wil you be wiling to receive more information on the vaccine,” the
message framing and character/background combination did not significantly afect the participants’ 
willingness. The interaction was not significant, either. Results of the analysis show that when participants
answered the question “wil you be wiling to consider receiving the vaccine,” the message framing and 
character/background combination did not significantly afect the participants’ wilingness but the interaction 
was significant (F(1,112) = 16.62, p < .001, η2 = .13). With a gain-framed message, regardless of the
character/background color combination, participants’ wilingness did not show significant diferences. 
However, when it was a loss-framed message and the character/background color combination was a white
background with black characters (M = 4.00, SD = 1.29), participants’ wilingness to consider receiving the 
vaccine was significantly better than a red background with white characters (M = 2.81, SD = 1.24), F(1,58) =
13.50, p <.001, η2 = .19).Results of the analysis show that when participants answered the question “wil you 
be wiling to be inoculated with the vaccine right away,” the message framing and character/background 
combination did not significantly affect the participant’s wilingness but the interaction was significant 
(F(1,112) = 9.08, p = .003, η2 = .08). With a gain-framed message, regardless of the character/background
color combination, participants’ wilingness did not show significant diferences. However, when it was a
loss-framed message and the character/background color combination was a white background with black
characters (M = 3.13, SD = 1.53), participants’ wilingness to be inoculated with the vaccine right away was 
significantly better than a red background with white characters (M = 2.50, SD = 1.04), F(1,58) = 3.91, p = .05,
η2 = .06).
Regarding the assessment of vaccine information, results of the analysis show that when participants
answered the question “your interest aroused by the vaccine information,”message framing is a significant
factor affecting the participants’interests in the vaccine information (F(1,112) = 9.26, p =.003, η2 = .08). With
a gain-framed message, the mean score of participants’ interests in the vaccine information (M = 3.92, SD =
1.77) was significantly lower than that with a loss-framed message (M = 4.84, SD = 1.50). On the other hand,
the influence of the character/background color combination on the participant’s interest in the vaccine
information was not significant. Neither was the interaction. Results of the analysis show that when
participants answered the question “how easy is the vaccine information for you to understand,”message
framing is a significant factor affecting the participants’understanding to the vaccine information (F(1,112) =
6.89, p = .01, η2 = .06). With a gain-framed message, the understanding participants had about the vaccine
information (M = 4.76, SD = 1.56) was significantly lower than that with a loss-framed message (M = 5.42,
SD = 1.16). On the other hand, the difference in the influence of the character/background color combination
on the participant’s understanding about the vaccine information was not significant. Neither was the
interaction. Results of the analysis show that when participants answered the question “how do you believe
the vaccine information,”message framing is a significant factor affecting the participants’perception of
believing the vaccine information (F(1,112) = 7.78, p < .01, η2 = .07). With a gain-framed message, the
participants felt the vaccine information were significantly more believable (M = 3.63, SD = 1.53) than that
with a loss-framed message (M = 4.40, SD = 1.49). On the other hand, the difference in the influence of the
character/background color combination on the participant’s perception of believing the vaccine information
was not significant. Neither was the interaction.
Discussion
Results of this study showed that the factor, message framing, would affect the participants’ perception of
the content of the promoting materials. When promoting materials on the H1N1 flu vaccine were presented
through loss-framed pictures and words, it worked better in drawing interest from the participants and being
understood and believed by the participants than gain-framed pictures and words. However, despite the fact
that loss-framed pictures and words would result in significantly positive assessment of the content of
promoting materials by participants, the participants did not appear to be more inclined to receive the vaccine
with loss-framed pictures and words as a result of this. Only when the vaccine information was stated through
loss-framed messages along with the character/background color combination of a white background with
black characters would participants be significantly more inclined to receive the vaccine.
Past studies show that when the HPV vaccine information was presented through loss-framed messages
