中文摘要
零售商是連結供應商與消費者支配銷通路中的最後一階段，而配銷通路指的是
將產品與服務從生產轉換到消費者的一系列的企業及人員。近年來，零售業者在經
營上承受極大壓力，面對低毛利的時代，零售業者開始重視績效管理的議題，因此
本研究計畫將以一個生活精品連鎖企業經營績效之研究為主，將針對一個企業與供
應商共同導入協通規劃預測補貨 (CPFR) 機制來改善販促商品及新品銷售量預測的
準確度，提升經營績效個案進行研究，並收集相關影響導入之因素後，，應用Fuzzy
AHP方法針對參與零售通路導入CPFR之專家群的意見分析導入影響因素；最後，
提出對零售通路導入CPFR的建議，希望本研究對欲導入CPFR之零售通路有一定程
度的參考價值。
Since the collaborative, planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR) was first
proposed in 1998, numerous studies have focused on exploring the related issue of CPFR
implementation in retailing. A considerable body of research has emphasized reduced costs,
increased sales and improved forecasting ability in practice. It is noted that there has been a lack
of research on the each importance of the various factors which affecting CPFR implementation
to date. To find the factors which affecting CPFR implementation and provide as a reference for
retailers deciding on the optimal allocation of resources when implementing CPFR, this paper
therefore first collected the important factors when adopting CPFR or business to business (B2B)
information system and further constructed a factor table of three hierarchical structure levels.
After a panel of scholars was invited to discuss the appropriateness and independent of factors
presented in the 3-layer hierarchical structure, a pairwise of analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
questionnaire was then designed and distributed to experts who were familiar with implementing
CPFR in the retailing industry. Finally, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP) was applied
to find out the weights of each impact factor after questionnaires were returned. The analysis of
each importance of critical impact factor was undertaken and the paths of the critical factors were
also analyzed. The result of this study indicate that the fuzzy AHP approach can be used to
provide more precise information that can serve as a valuable reference for retailers when it
comes to allocating the optimal resource when implementing CPFR.

4demonstrated that implementation of CPFR can reduce inventory levels, increase sales, and
improve trade partnerships. Esper and Williams (2003) worked on a case study and discovered
collaborative transportation management (CTM) could bring about better outcomes and profits by
implementing CPFR. Finally, Sari (2008) proposed a comprehensive simulation model which
represented two widely used supply chain initiatives, CPFR and VMI, and the results indicated
that the benefits arising from CPFR are always higher than those from VMI. Furthermore, Du et
al.(2009) applied a framework of CPFR to develop a procurement model for agricultural products
and showed that the service level is increased and inventory variance is reduced. This indicated
that the proposed model can thus improve the accuracy of forecasting and reduce inventory
losses.
Previous studies demonstrate that CPFR research has emphasized reduced costs, increased
sales and improved forecasting ability in practice. It is noted that there has been a lack of research
on the each importance of the various factors which affecting CPFR implementation to date.
Therefore, we applied fuzzy AHP to find out each importance of critical impact factor for
implementing CPFR in this study.
3. Methodology
There are many factors that affect the adoption of CPFR by firms. If enterprises can
understand the degree of importance of any given factor, this will enable them allocate the
optimal levels of resources to implement CPFR with lower costs and greater efficiency. The
purpose of this paper is thus to find the degree of importance of each factor. Therefore, this is a
multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a
multi-criteria technique proposed by Saaty (1980), which has been widely applied to solve such
problems. One of the advantages of AHP is that it is easy to understand, and can effectively
handle both qualitative and quantitative data, without the use of cumbersome mathematics.
However, we also find that AHP does not account for the fuzziness inherent in human
thought or environmental uncertainty, so that it may not be able to objectively reveal the actual
situation being considered. Thus, Laarhoven and Pedrycz (1983) proposed the fuzzy analytic
hierarchy process (FAHP) to address this deficiency. Fuzzy AHP considers the uncertainty and
multi-criteria aspects of the focal problems and related experts’ opinions. When there are many
decision-making criteria and alternative options, fuzzy AHP can avoid the subjectivity of
pairwise comparisons and the resulting inaccurate results. Therefore, this study utilized fuzzy
AHP as the research methodology. Since there are no standard procedures for fuzzy AHP, this
paper generalized the calculation procedures based on a literature review (Buckley, 1985; Csutora
and Buckley, 2001) as follows:
(1) Describe the evaluation issues
These ‘issues’ are the focal point and basis ofthe research discussion, and are also the
targets for the final evaluations.
(2) Establish a factor hierarchy framework
Based on the evaluation issues, a factor hierarchy framework is constructed. The next
hierarchical factor is a precise description of the previous hierarchical factors.
(3) Design questionnaire
This study conducted a pairwise comparison of the factors in the same hierarchy based on a
factor hierarchical table to develop a questionnaire in the AHP format. Two types of scale are
usually used to measure the relative weight among the item statements. One utilizes a “crisp” 
scale, which is like a Likert-scale; the other uses an interval scale. These two scales both have
their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, data collected using a crisp scale are discrete,
so they are more specific and easier for calculation. In contrast, data collected using an interval
scale is continuous in nature, and thus more able to represent the fuzziness inherent in the human
thought processes. Past studies tended to feature a crisp scale in their questionnaires, while this
study used an interval scale and constructed fuzzy numbers of al respondents’ answer intervals.
(4) Establish fuzzy numbers
The most common fuzzy numbers are trapezoidal fuzzy and triangular. In this paper, we use
trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to set up a positive reciprocal matrix. To establish the trapezoidal
fuzzy numbers, there are four trapezoidal fuzzy numbers:α,β,γandδ. The fuzzy numbersαandδ
64. Factors Analysis
According to the literature review, CPFR is kind of B2B information technology system
(B2BIS). Therefore, this study collects related factors which affect retailers implementing CPFR
and B2BIS, and further construct the hierarchy structure which includes three levels, that is the
goal, criteria and sub-criteria levels. The criteria level delineates a more precise strategic
objective based on the goal level. Similarly, the sub-criteria level illustrates a clearer index
according to the criteria level. Therefore, the sub-criteria level is the most specific factor
dimension. The hierarchical structure can enable enterprises to better understand the
cause-and-effect relationship among all factors, as well as prevent errors such as the simultaneous
appearance of the same factor in different levels.
In addition, the foundation of the goal level is the Technology-Organization-Environment
(TOE) structure model, which is capable of viewing the relevant and influential information
systems raised by Tornatzky and Fleischer (1990), with the exploration being undertaken from
three major perspectives, namely by considering the technological, organizational, and
environmental indicators. The criteria level of the technology indicator includes three dimensions,
that is, system efficacy, information technology and implementation risk. The criteria level of the
organization indicator includes organizational collaboration effect, organizational leadership and
organizational capability. The criteria level of the environment indicator includes
micro-environment condition, macro-environment condition and partnership condition. There are
thus nine dimensions on the criteria level. For each dimension on the criteria level, three variables
are raised for more detailed attributes in the sub-criteria level. The criteria level of system
efficacy includes system function integrity, electronic data interchange and information
technology service. The criteria level of information technology includes reliability, maturity, and
stability. The criteria level of implementation risk encompasses system compatibility, system
security, and system complexity. The criteria level of collaborative effect aspect includes mutual
objectives, information sharing, and perceived benefit. The criteria level of the organizational
leadership includes top management support, change management and educational training. The
criteria level of organizational capability includes amalgamation compatibility of technology and
culture, organizational innovation capability, and cross-department communication and
collaboration capability. The criteria level of micro-environment condition includes industrial
competitiveness, information readiness and industrial know-how and experience. The criteria
level of the macro-environment condition includes political policies, competition pressure, and
infrastructure. Therefore, the sub-criteria of the partnership condition include organization scale,
resource support and trust and communication. The hierarchical structure for retailers adopting
CPFR is shown in Table 2.
5. Data Collection and Analysis
5.1 Data collection
The purpose of this study is to analyze the importance of factors which affect enterprises
when they implement the CPFR model. Therefore, data collection was based on the steps of the
fuzzy AHP approach. After reviewing the literature and colecting the experts’ opinions, this 
study allocated the factors related to enterprises implementing CPFR into a three-level
hierarchical structure, namely goal, criteria and sub-criteria levels, as shown in Table 2. After a
panel of scholars was invited to discuss the appropriateness and independent of factors presented
in the 3-layer hierarchical structure, a pairwise comparison questionnaire in the AHP format was
designed.. Next, we selected 10 experts with considerable experience in implementing the CPFR
model, and they were asked by hand to give answers on a 1-9 point interval scale for a total of
thirty-nine questions. A total of 10 valid questionnaires were returned, giving a 100% response
rate. In passing, it should be noted that the absolute size of the sample is not the crucial issue in
AHP analysis, because the methodology is not essentially statistically based. Rather, the crucial
issue is whether the available observations constitute an accurate qualitative representation of the
entire field under analysis (Lam and Zhao, 1998; Dias Jr. and Ioannou, 1996). Therefore, ten
samples are enough to implement the fuzzy AHP approach.
8environment indicator (16.76%). Therefore, the organizational determinant is the most critical
indicator for businesses to consider when adopting CPFR. That is the decision-maker of retailing
should focus on the organizational indicator such as organization collaboration effect,
organization leadership, and organization capability.

5.2.2 Criteria level
The data analysis of the criteria level leads to the following conclusions. With regard to the
organizational indicator, organization capability (53.17%) is a more critical element than
organizational leadership (29.95%) and organization collaboration effect (16.88%). This implies
that the amalgamation compatibility of technology and culture, organizational innovative
capability, and cross-department communication and collaboration capability are critical criteria
which have a significant impact on retailers’ implementation of the CPFR model. Second, with 
regard to the technology indicator, the respondents considered the important priorities were
implementation risk (58.25%), system efficacy (28.78%), and information technology (12.98%).
The results indicated that implementation risk, such as system security and system complexity, is
likely to have the greatest influence on the intention to implement the CPFR model.
Finally, with regard to environmental indicator, the priorities of critical criteria are the
10
hierarchical structure there are six sub-criteria which are highly relevant to organizational
indicators, such as cross-department communication and collaboration capability, change
management, organizational innovation capability, mutual objective, amalgamation capability of
technology and culture, and top management support. Among these, three are closely connected
with the technology indicators, with one mainly associated with environmental indicators. From
the above analysis, we can find that the criteria of organizational indicators have the main
influence effect on CPFR model. This suggests that retailers should pay particular attention to
these critical factors when implementing CPFR within limited resources.

Sum of weights 0.719855
As mentioned above, we propose the path patterns of CPFR implementation based on the
top seven sub-criteria whose weights are all greater than 0.05, as shown in Figure 1. There are
two main paths for retailers to implement CPFR. With regard to technology indicators, the key
impact factor at the criteria level is implementation risk, while system complexity is the most
important factor at the sub-criteria level.
On the other hand, with regard to the organizational indicators aspect, the criteria level
should focus on organizational management, organizational leadership, and organization
collaboration effect. The crucial factor at the sub-criteria level is mutual objective in organization
collaboration effect. The crucial factors in the sub-criteria level are top management support and
change management in organizational leadership. The crucial factors at the sub-criteria level are
amalgamation capability of technology and culture, organization innovation capability, and
cross-department communication capability in organization capability. It is worth noting that
decision-makers of retailer should pay attention to critical paths which facilitate an efficient use
of limited enterprise resources according to the weights of these crucial factors when
implementing the CPFR model.
7. Conclusions
From the retailer perspective, the benefit of adopting the CPFR model is that it can reduce
out-of-stock incidents and improve the inventory turnover ratio. The current trend of retailing
management is to efficiently make use of limited resources to enhance competitive advantages in
the supply chain. Therefore, this study explored the critical impact factors that retailers should
consider in implementing CPFR, using data analysis to examine each factor. A summary of the
findings and suggestions are presented below.
The results of this study show that the critical impact factors for retailers adopting CPFR
model are cross-department communication & collaboration capability, change management,
organizational innovation capability, system complexity, mutual objective, amalgamation
capability of technology and culture, top management support, trust and communication, system
security and electronic data interchange. The best strategy for retailers, therefore, is to focus on
these criteria, in particular the most important indictors, when allocating limited resources. For
instance, from the organizational perspective, retailers should consider an assignment project
which conducts related work, such as the integration of cross-department communication and
collaboration capability, organizational innovation capability, and amalgamation capability of
technology and culture. Moreover, from the technology and environment perspective, simplifying
