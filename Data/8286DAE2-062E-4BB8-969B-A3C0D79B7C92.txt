1 Introduction
Bayesian approaches have been widely used
in estimating failure rates in reliability
analysis. It is especially important in the
case where a system or component is highly
reliable such that failure data can be either
expensive or difficult to obtain. Many of the
development in the uses of Bayesian relia-
bility analysis have been reviewed and sum-
marized in Martz and Waller (1982).
When data from the same observation
period are available at both component
and system levels, different alternatives can
be chosen to evaluate the reliability of a
system. Two extremes are the aggregate
and disaggregate analyses. The aggregate
analysis refers to the approach uses only
system-level (aggregate) data while the dis-
aggregate analysis is the approach uses only
component-level (disaggregate) data. In
practice, if the data at the sub-system level
are available, it might also be possible to
perform the Bayesian estimation at inter-
mediate levels of aggregation.
Since the aggregate analysis can save the
effort and cost of collecting a large amount
of data, it is usually less costly and more
practical. However, as discussed in Mosleh
and Bier (1992), it might provide inaccu-
rate results by ignoring important informa-
tion available at the component level. Con-
versely, a disaggregate analysis makes use
of all the available data and provide more
accurate results, but can be very expensive
and impractical.
When the failures of the components of a
system are not independent, a disaggregate
Bayesian analysis can be even more difficult
to perform since a joint prior distribution
must be specified and then updated with
component-level data. In the real-world sit-
uation, a simplified disaggregate analysis
without considering the dependence struc-
ture of the components might be used in-
stead of the true disaggregate analysis. Al-
though the computation become much sim-
pler, the accuracy of the analysis might be
seriously affected due to the ignorance of
the critical information of dependence.
While several researchers (Bier, 1994;
Martz et al., 1988; Martz and Waller, 1990;
Mastran, 1976, 1978) have investigated the
situation where data are available at both
the component and system levels, there is
not yet a generalized study of the situation
where the components are correlated. In
this research, we apply the copulas to re-
liability analysis on a simple two compo-
nents series system, and both the aggregate
error and the error caused by disaggregate
analysis with a simplified independence as-
sumption are studied. This analysis will
provide a guideline for selecting appropri-
ate Bayesian estimation approaches in eval-
uating the reliability of a system in which
components are correlated.
Section 2 below briefly presents the back-
ground of the two components series sys-
tems considered in this report. Some basic
concepts of bivariate copulas are reviewed
in Section 3. A comparison of numerical re-
sults for the sum of frequency model is dis-
cussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 gives
conclusions and directions for future work.
2 Two Components Se-
ries Systems
Consider a system made up of two com-
ponents in series, as shown in Figure 1,
where component 1 and 2 fail according
to Poisson processes with failure rates λ1
and λ2. The entire system will fail (not
necessarily in a Poisson manner) with
frequency λ = λ1 + λ2.

whose one-dimensional marginals are uni-
form on the interval (0,1). In the bivari-
ate case, for any given joint cumulative dis-
tribution function (CDF) F (x, y) with one-
dimensional marginal CDF’s F (x) and G(y)
(for random variables X and Y , respec-
tively), there exists a two-dimensional cop-
ula C such that
FX,Y (x, y) = C(F (x), G(y)) (4)
for all x and y (Sklar, 1959).
In this research, we intend to investigate
the performances of the different Bayesian
risk analysis approaches when applied to a
system where the failures of components are
dependent. Copulas are thus used to con-
struct bivariate distribution functions with
correlated marginal random variables, and
a measure of the dependence between mar-
ginals need to be specified. There are sev-
eral different ways of measuring correlation
between random variables. Kendall’s τ , a
rank correlation coeffieicent, is a convenient
way of measuring the degree of correlation
reflected in joint distributions constructed
using copulas (Kruskal, 1958; Hollander and
Wolfe, 1973; Lehmann, 1975). This cor-
relation coefficient measure the association
only in terms of ranks, it is preserved under
monotonic transformation and thus invari-
ant to the choice of the marginal distrib-
utions of the correlated random variables,
and is therefore a function of the copula
alone. In particular, when random variables
X and Y are continuous, then we have
τX,Y = τC = 4
∫ ∫

C(u, v)dC(u, v)− 1
(5)
(Nelsen, 1999; Schweizer and Wolff, 1981).
Some copulas have relatively simple closed-
form expressions for Kendall’s τ . Even
when closed-form expressions are not avail-
able, they can be easily obtained via numer-
ical integration. This make it easy to con-
struct joint distributions with prescribed
marginals and concordance or rank corre-
lation coefficients. Some bivariate Gamma
distribution constructed using Plackett’s
family (Plackett, 1965) of two-dimensional
copula with Kendall’s τ equals to -0.5, -0.2,
0.2, 0.5, and marginal distributions follow
gamma(2, 5) are shown in Figure 2.

Gamma Marginals
4 Numerical Illustration
For getting a natural conjugate prior
used in this study, a bivariate distribu-
tion with gamma marginals must be de-
rived. The correlation between the mar-
ginals also need to be specified. As
in section 2, let λ1 and λ2 be random
variables representing the failure rates of
component 1 and 2, respectively. Also,
let Fλ1,λ2(λ1, λ2) = C(Fλ1(λ1), Fλ2(λ2)) be
a prior joint CDF with marginal CDF’s
Fλ1(λ1) and Fλ2(λ2) and copula C, and let
Fλ1(λ1) and Fλ2(λ2) be gamma distribu-
tions with parameters (a1, b1) and (a2, b2).
Then, the prior joint PDF satisfies
fλ1,λ2(λ1, λ2)
=
∂2
∂λ1∂λ2
Fλ1,λ2(λ1, λ2)
= c(Fλ1(λ1), Fλ2(λ2))fλ1(λ1)fλ2(λ2)
∝ c(Fλ1(λ1), Fλ2(λ2))
· λa1−11 e−λ1b1λa2−22 e−λ2b2 (6)

(2) When the scale parameters, λ1 and λ2,
of the prior marginals are not the same,
the information regarding the ratio of
the component failures k1/k2 become
important. Other than the cases where
there are no or few points observed,
the aggregate analysis tends to produce
much worse results when k1/k2 is not
consistent with the marginal prior dis-
tributions.
(3) When the scale parameters b1, b2 of
the prior distributions of λ1 and λ2
are the same, the aggregate analysis
might work better when component 1
and component 2 are dependent. Al-
though the disaggregate analysis might
also be favored in some cases, the rela-
tive difference tends to be too small to
be important in real-world application.
5 Conclusions
We consider a simple two-component ser-
ial system where the failures of the com-
ponents are not independent, compare the
aggregation error and the error caused by
disaggregate analysis with independent as-
sumption, and identify the factors affecting
the relative magnitudes of these errors. We
found that if the data points for different
components are consistent with the prior
distributions, then the aggregate analysis
can achieve reasonably accuracy since only
little information is lost when system-level
data are used. By similar arguments, the
aggregate analysis can also outperform the
simplified disaggregate analysis when there
is less data points (failures) than expected.
In this research, we only address a sim-
ple two-component series system. We be-
lieve that extending our results to include n-
component system would help to shed light
on how the different analysis approaches
would behave under a wider range of con-
ditions. Also, it is clearly important to
address other types of system. For exam-
ple, we might consider the Parallel Bernoulli
System, where component 1 has failure
probability P1 on any given trial, and com-
ponent 2 has conditional failure probability
P2 given failure of component 1, and the
failure probability of the system is given by
the product P1P2.
We expect that the results of this work
will provide a guideline for selecting ap-
propriate Bayesian estimation approaches
in evaluating the reliability of a system in
which components are correlated.
