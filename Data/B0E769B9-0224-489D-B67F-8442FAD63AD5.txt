Report of the project 99-2221-E-155-016 “Thermodynamic 
description of the ternary Cu – Zn – Zr system” 
 
 
Introduction. 
H2 fuel, for fuel cells, is traditionally produced from methanol by the 
endothermic steam reforming of methanol (SRM). Partial oxidation of methanol 
(POM), which is highly exothermic, has also been suggested as a route to extract H2 
from methanol. In both these reactions a considerable amount of CO is produced as a 
byproduct, which is a poison to the Pt anode of the fuel cell. A combined steam 
reforming and partial oxidation of methanol, which has been termed ‘‘oxidative steam 
reforming of methanol’’ (OSRM), reported recently is considered to be more efficient 
and convenient for the selective production of H2 at a relatively low temperature. The 
catalysts used in the OSRM reaction were CuZnAl mixed oxides derived from 
hydroxycarbonate precursors containing hydrotalcite (HT)-like layered double 
hydroxides (LDHs)/aurichalcite phases. Substitution of Zr for Al in the CuZnAl oxide 
system was found to improve the catalytic performance, thus the knowledge of the 
ternary system Cu – Zn – Zr seems to be essential for future development of catalysts. 
Recently, the big role in phase diagrams field plays computational thermodynamics as 
a tool allowing for fast and efficient calculation and prediction of phase diagrams. 
However, before the calculation can be performed, the database of Gibbs energies 
must be prepared. The thermodynamic database for the ternary Cu – Zn – Zr system 
was prepared under this project. 
 
Method. 
The CALPHAD (Calculation of PHAse Diagrams) method [1] was a main tool 
used for preparing thermodynamic description of the ternary system. Chemical 
potentials and the thermodynamic factor (the second derivative of the Gibbs energy) 
are used in diffusion simulations. The driving forces of the phases are used to simulate 
the evolution of microstructures on the basis of Landau theory. In solidification 
simulations the fractions of solid phases and segregation of components as well as 
energies of metastable states, which are experimentally observed by carrying out rapid 
solidification, are used. Whenever the thermodynamic description of a system is 
 
Intermetallic compounds Cu9Zr2, Cu51Zr14, Cu8Zr3, Cu2Zr, Cu10Zr7, CuZr, 
Cu5Zr7, CuZr2, Zn22Zr, Zn2Zr, Zn2Zr3, Zn39Zr5, Zn3Zr_H, Zn3Zr_L, ZnZr and 
ZnZr2. 
Since the intermetallic compounds don’t show homogeneity range, the phases were 
treated as the line compounds. In this case, the Gibbs energy is described as follows: 
       (3)   jiji ZrCumxsZrZrMMZrMm GGxGxTG  00
Where: M denotes Cu or Zn, and are Gibbs energies of Cu and Zr in the 
crystal structure stable at 298.15K under pressure 1bar (i.e. functions GHSER), 
respectively. The Gibbs energy is the excess Gibbs energy of the phase MiZrj 
and it is given by a function A+BT.

Optimization procedure. 
The thermodynamic parameters for phases in the systems Cu-Zr, Cu – Zn and 
Cu – ZN – Zr were optimized using ThermoCalc v. S [3] software, and the results 
were checked additionally using Pandat v.8 [4] software.  For this optimization, 
thermodynamic data for the liquid and IMCs, invariant reactions and liquidus data 
were used.  Each piece of the selected information was given a certain weight based 
on personal judgment.  The optimization was carried out, step by step, in agreement 
with the guidelines given by Schmid-Fetzer et al. [5] .  First, the optimization of the 
liquid phase was performed, and then the other phases were assessed. All parameters 
were finally evaluated together to provide the best description of the system. The 
calculated thermodynamic database is attached as an Apendix 1. 
 
Result and discussion. 
The calculated binary systems Al – Cu, Cu – Zn and Cu – Zr are shown in 
Figures 1 – 3, respectively. The thermodynamic description of the system Al – Cu has 
been taken from literature [6]. The description of the systems Cu – Zn and Cu – Zr 
were done by the author; however, the modeling of the Cu – Zn system was 
performed before the project started. Both descriptions (Cu – Zn and Cu – Zr) were 
published in SCI journals [7,8]. The Apendix 2 shows published description of the

From this Figure it is clear, that for the given nominal composition, there are two 
phases in equilibrium. To answer for the question about composition of the phases, the 
examination of the sample by Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA) is necessary. 
Unfortunately, there is available only one device at National Taiwan University and 
we were not able to finish examination of all the samples. In addition, the samples 
were checked by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) what should help in 
improvement of liquidus projection calculation. The full analysis of the DSC results 
will be performed after finishing the EPMA examination.  
The thermodynamic description of the ternary Cu – Zn – Zr system prepared by 
interpolation of binary systems, together with the experimental data obtained from 
phase eqilibria and DSC experiments will be base for the extension of the presented in 
Appendix 1 database. However, as it was mentioned before, we have to wait for 
finishing the EPMA experiments first.  
Besides the calculation of the Cu – Zn – Zr system, the financial support was used for 
preparing part of publication about Se – Te system (accepted for publication in 
IJMR – Appendix 4) and 3 orala presentations at international conferences: TMS 
meeting 2011 in San Diego and MRS-T international conference in Taipei 2011 
(Appendixes 5 – 7). 
 
Summary. 
The new thermodynamic description of the ternary system Cu – Zn – Zr was 
proposed. The solid state equilibria were calculated and after that examined by phase 
equilibria experiment; however, the EPMA experiment is not finished yet because of 
waiting time for using the apparatus at NTU. The financial support was used for 
publication two SCI papers and giving 3 talks at international conferences.

Zaitsev et al. [12] measured chemical potential of components in
heterogeneous Cu–Zr alloys. Based on the result they calculated
partial thermodynamic functions for heterogeneous alloys and the
functions of the formations of the Cu–Zr intermetallic compounds.
Ansara et al. [14] measured enthalpy of formation of the CuZr,
CuZr2 intermetallic compounds and for alloy Cu0.45Zr0.55 what
does not correspond with one phase region. Yamaguchi et al. [10]
measured heat content of seven Cu–Zr alloys at the temperature
range between 878 K and 1468 K using calorimetric method. In that
range of temperatures all alloys exist in both: solid and liquid states.
The enthalpy of formation of Cu51Zr14 was measured using calori-
metric method by Weihs et al. [15] and by Meschel and Kleppa [16].
Kleppa and Watanabe [8] determined also the enthalpies of forma-
tion of four congruent melting compounds: Cu10Zr7, CuZr, CuZr2
and Cu51Zr14.
2.2. Phase equilibria information
The whole liquidus line was described ﬁrst time by Lundin et al.
[17]. After that a number of papers about the solid–liquid equilib-
rium were published. The liquidus line was described by Glimois
et al. [18], Kuznetsov et al. [19], Pogodin et al. [20], Braga et al. [21],
Raub and Engel [22] and Douglas and Morgan [23]. The phase rela-
tionship in the Cu–Zr system was described by Lundin et al. [17]
who proposed four intermetallic compounds: Cu3Zr, Cu3Zr2, CuZr
and CuZr2 which melt congruently and one phase Cu5Zr2 which
forms by peritectic reaction. Besides Lundin et al. [17] the system
was investigated by Allibone and Syknes [18], by Pogodin et al.
[19], by Raub and Engel [22], by Donachie [24], by Vitek [25], by
Kuznetsov et al. [19], by Glimois et al. [18] by Forey et al. [26], by
Bsenko [27], by Gabathuler et al. [28], by Perry and Hugi [29], by
Philips [30] by Kneller et al. [31] and by Braga et al. [21]. Generally
speaking, the information agrees one another; however, there are
two propositions for a stoichiometry of Cu–rich intermetallic phase.
The stoichiometry Cu3Zr was proposed by Lundin et al. [17], inves-
tigated by Allibone and Syknes [18], by Pogodin et al. [20], and by
Raub and Engel [22] when Donachie[24],  Vitek [25] and Kuznetsov
et al. [19] proposed Cu4Zr or Cu9Zr2. The composition Cu9Zr2 was
ﬁnally conﬁrmed by Glimois et al. [18] and by Forey et al. [26].
2.3. Thermodynamic modeling
The binary Cu–Zr system was modeled by several researchers.
Zeng and Hamalainen [32] modeled the system using substitonal
solution [33] for describing the liquid phase. In their work, the
enthalpy of mixing was treated as a function independent on tem-
perature. He et al. [34] kept the description proposed by Zeng and
Hamalainen [32] except Gibbs energy of the intermetallic com-
pound CuZr. Abe et al. [35] focused on thermodynamic description
of the liquid using associate solution model [36]. Wang et al. [37]
proposed another thermodynamic description of the binary Cu–Zr
system. Also in this work, the enthalpy of mixing was treated as a
function independent on temperature. Finally, Kang and Jung [38]
used modiﬁed quasi-chemical model [39] for the description of the
liquid phase.
3. Thermodynamic description of the phases
The binary Cu–Zr system contains 12 phases: HCP A3 (low
temperature Zr), BCC A2 (high temperature Zr), FCC A1 (Cu), inter-
metallic compounds Cu9Zr2, Cu51Zr14, Cu8Zr3, Cu2Zr, Cu10Zr7, CuZr,
Cu5Zr7, CuZr2 and liquid. Information about crystal structures is
gathered in Table 1. The intermetallic compounds do not show
homogeneity range and in that case were treated as line compounds
in this work.

3.1. Pure elements
The Gibbs free energies of pure elements with respect to tem-
perature 0Gi(T) = Gi(T) − HSERi are represented by Eq. (1):
0Gi(T) = a + bT + cT ln(T) + dT2 + eT−1 + fT3 + iT4 + jT7 + kT−9
(1)
The 0Gi(T) data refers to the constant enthalpy value of the stan-
dard element reference HSER
i
at 298.15 K and 1 bar as recommended
by Scientiﬁc Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE) [40]. The reference
states are: FCC A1 (Cu), HCP A3 (Zr). The 0Gi(T) expression may  be
given for several temperature ranges, where the coefﬁcients a, b,
c, d, e, f, i, j, k have different values. The 0Gi(T) functions are taken
from SGTE Unary (Pure elements) TDB v.4.4 [40].
Solutions (FCC A1,HCP Zn, BCC A2, Liquid):
Solid and liquid solution phases are described by the substitu-
tional solution model [33]:

part is the Redlich–Kister
polynomial for excess Gibbs
free energy. The parameters vLij have aform vA + vBT + vCT ln(T).
Using parameter C is depending on the thermodynamic character-
istic of the phase. In case of temperature dependency of enthalpy
of mixing of the phase the parameter C should be used.
Intermetallic compounds Cu9Zr2, Cu51Zr14, Cu8Zr3, Cu2Zr,
Cu10Zr7, CuZr, Cu5Zr7, CuZr2.
Since the intermetallic compounds do not show homogeneity
range, the phases were treated as the line compounds. In this case,
the Gibbs energy is described as follows:
GCuiZrjm (T) = xCu0GCu + xZr0GZr + xsGCuiZrjm (3)
where 0GCu and 0GZr are Gibbs energies of Cu and Zr in the crys-
tal structure stable at 298.15 K under pressure 1 bar (i.e. functions
GHSER), respectively. The Gibbs energy xsGCuiZrjm is the excess Gibbs
energy of the phase CuiZrj and it is given by a function A + BT.
3.2. Optimization procedure
The thermodynamic parameters for all phases in the system
were optimized using ThermoCalc v. S software [41], and the results

clear for reading, the experimental information was  not included
in this ﬁgure. Fig. 2 shows calculated phase diagram superimposed
with experimental data obtained by several researchers. Taking
into account that a density of experimental information could make
this picture unclear we decided to show data obtained by Yam-
aguchi et al. [10], by Braga et al. [21], by Raub and Engel [22] and by
Douglas and Morgan [23]. The phase diagram reproduces experi-
mental data well. The small discrepancy can be found for liquidus
line of the region Zr-BCC; however,the equilibrium between Zr-
BCC and CuZr2 is in very good agreement with the data obtained
by Douglas and Morgan [23]. Fig. 3 shows zoomed in Zr-rich part
of the phase diagram together with experimental data obtained
by Lundin et al. [17]. This picture exhibits very good agreement
between calculation and one-phase and two-phase regions deter-
mined experimentally. Calculated invariant reactions compared to
experimental data obtained by different researchers are gathered
in Table 3. Information collected in this table shows big discrepancy
between temperatures of reactions obtained by different authors;
however, calculated results lay inside a span of experimental data.
Fig. 4 shows calculated enthalpy of mixing of liquid Cu–Zr alloy
at 1000 K and at 1473 K superimposed with experimental data
obtained by Yamaguchi et al. [10], by Abe et al. [35] by Sommer and
Choi [6] and by Kleppa and Watanabe [8].  From this picture one can
see that proposed substitional model described well temperature
dependency of enthalpy of mixing of liquid phase. In Fig. 5 one can
see calculated activity of Cu at 1673 K together with experimental
data obtained by Zaitsev et al. [12] and by Sommer and Choi [6] at
Fig. 4. Calculated enthalpy of mixing of the liquid phase at 1473 K and 1000 K super-
imposed.
1673 K and at 1623 K, respectively. This Figure also shows very good
agreement between calculation and experimental information. As
it was  mentioned earlier, in opposite to Abe et al. [35] we  did not
use liquid associate Cu2Zr in our description. There are two rea-
sons for this treatment of the liquid phase. First one is that shape
of enthalpy of mixing of the liquid phase does not exhibit sharp
extreme; the second reason is that a solid intermetallic compound
Cu2Zr decomposes by peritectic reaction at 1114 K and because
of that should not be stable as an associate in the liquid phase.
Fig. 6 shows calculated chemical potential of Zr in various phases
at the function of temperature superimposed with experimental
data obtained by Zaitsev et al. [12] by electromotive force mea-
surement. Interesting comparison between chemical potential of
zirconium obtained by Zaitsev et al. [12] and previous optimiza-
tion can be found in Kang and Jung [38] work. From Fig. 6 one
can ﬁnd that our proposition of the description of the Cu–Zr sys-
tem agrees well with Zaitsev et al. [12] experimental work. Fig. 7
exhibits calculated heat of dissolution of Zr in BCC A2 structure in
the liquid at 1443 K superimposed with experimental data obtained
by Yamaguchi et al. [10]. Generally speaking, the calculation repro-
duces experiment well, only for a concentration of Zr equal 0.4 mole
fraction modeled function is more negative than experiment. Sum-
marizing comparison of the calculation and experimental data, one
can say that proposed a new set of Gibbs energy functions repro-
duce well thermodynamic properties and phase diagram of the
binary Cu–Zr system.

tion of temperature. Based on thermodynamic properties of the
liquid obtained by several experimental techniques we did not ﬁnd
any reason for using more complicated mathematical description
of the liquid behavior. Using the substitional solution model allows
for easy extrapolation to higher-ordered systems.

Cu–Zn is an important binary alloy system. In the interested temperature range from
300 to 1500 K, there are eight phases, liquid, Cu, , , , , , and Zn phases. The
thermodynamic descriptions of the Cu–Zn system are reassessed using the CALPHAD
method. A new description of liquid phase and simplified description of body-centered
cubic (bcc) phase are proposed. Good agreement has been found among the calculated
thermodynamic properties, phase diagram, and the experimental information.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cu–Zn is an important binary alloy system. Copper-
rich Cu–Zn-based alloys are primary structural materi-
als.1,2 Phase relationships of the Cu–Zn system at the
Cu-rich side had been examined extensively very early
due to the industrial interests of brasses.1,2 Even though
not as critical as in the Cu industry, the Cu–Zn binary
system is important for the aluminum industry as well,
because the Al-rich Al–Mg–Cu–Zn alloys are the base
alloys for almost all the commercial aluminum alloys.3,4
The Cu–Zn system has received attention again recently
because the Sn-rich Sn–Cu–Zn-based alloys are promis-
ing Pb-free solders.5,6 Understanding the interfacial re-
actions between Cu and Zn is valuable for the electronic
products as well, since Cu is frequently used as wetting
layers for under-bump metallurgy (UBM) and conduc-
tion lines and Zn is an promising ingredient element
of Pb-free solders.5,6 It is well known that good thermo-
dynamic descriptions of a binary system are crucial for
both the understanding of the binary system itself and its
use for building thermodynamic descriptions of higher-
order systems.7 This study thus reassesses the liquid
phase and proposes a simplified description of the body-
centered cubic (bcc) phase in the Cu–Zn binary system,
primarily due to the recent interests of electronic appli-
cations.
II. PHASE EQUILIBRIA DATA
The first phase diagram of Cu–Zn system was pub-
lished in 1913.1 Based on the available experimental
data,1,2,8–10 Hansen11 proposed the first assessed Cu–Zn
phase diagram in 1936. Although there are some modi-
fications,12,13 there are no dramatic changes of the
phase boundaries of the Cu–Zn phase diagram proposed
by Hansen.11 There are eight solution phases in the
system: liquid, Cu, , , , , , and Zn.13 The crystal
structures of the solid phases are: Cu—FCC_A1,
— B C C _ A 2 ,  — B C C _ B 2 , — D 8 2 B C C ,
—BCC_A2, —HCP_A3, and Zn—HCP_Zn, and they
are listed in Table I. The most recent assessment by
Massalski et al.13 summarized that there are six invariant
reactions: five peritectics and one eutectoid. All the data
concerning invariant reactions used for the assess-
ment are shown in Table II. Order–disorder transforma-
tion of the – phase has been investigated,14,15 and
the reactions are at 729 K and 741 K of compositions
xZn  0.448 and xZn  0.482, respectively.
III. THERMOCHEMICAL DATA
Thermochemical properties of the Cu–Zn alloys have
been determined by various groups, and the efforts are
summarized in Tables III and IV for the liquid phase and
solid phase, respectively. The enthalpies of mixing of

of the experimental chemical potentials of Zn are in
agreement with each other in the regime with lower
Zn concentration (less than 0.1 mol fraction). How-
ever, significant differences are observed between the
results measured by different techniques of the alloys
of higher Zn concentrations. The chemical potentials of
Zn in the intermetallic compounds were also deter-
mined experimentally,35,36,38 and the results are shown in

VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The enthalpies of mixing of liquid phase at three dif-
ferent temperatures calculated with the thermodynamic
parameters listed in Table V are shown in Fig. 1, and
they are in good agreement with the experimental re-
sults.17,23,32 The results determined by Parameswaran
and Healy16 are not included in the optimization process
because their data are not consistent with others.17,23,32
The calculated heat of mixing also coincides with the
trend that the liquid solution becomes an ideal solution
with increasing temperatures.45 The calculated enthalpies
of formation of the simplified  and  phases are shown
in Fig. 2, and they are in agreement as well. The param-
eters of the  phase used for calculation are listed in
Table V.
As shown in Fig. 3, the chemical potentials of Zn in
liquid phase at 1200 and 1373 K are calculated and com-
pared with the experimental determinations.24,25,27 The
results are in good agreement. Figure 4 shows the chemi-
cal potential results of the experimental determinations
of Zn in solid phases33–38 together with the calculated
results obtained from the simplified descriptions of the
 phase. Although the experimental data are at many
different temperatures, for better visibility calcula-
tion curves at only three temperatures, 1123, 1000, and
733 K, are shown. The results by Argent and Wakeman33
and Hargreaves36 were both determined at 1000 K. The
calculated chemical potentials at 1000 K are in good
agreement with both results and are lying between the
two sets of experimental values.33,36
Figures 5 and 6 are the Cu–Zn phase diagrams calcu-
lated with the simplified and full descriptions, respec-
tively. The calculated invariant reactions are summarized
in Table II. The calculated phase boundaries and the
calculated reaction temperatures using the full descrip-
tion are all in good agreement with the experimental
determinations.8–10 The invariant reaction temperatures
calculated with the simplified description are in good
agreement with experimental results as well. However,
as expected, there are discrepancies between the phase
boundaries of Cu– and – phase regions. There are
slight deviations between the phase boundaries calcu-
lated by using the full description of this study and those
proposed by Kowalski and Spencer,41 and as shown in
Table II the invariant reaction temperatures calculated by
using the two models41 are almost identical.
If the thermodynamic descriptions of binary systems
are used only for binary phase diagram calculations, the
thermodynamic description by Kowalski and Spencer41
is as good as the full description of this study. However,
an important aspect of the CALPHAD approach is the
extrapolations of the thermodynamic models of lower-
order into higher-order systems. As mentioned previ-
ously, Kowalski and Spencer41 described the enthalpy of
mixing of liquid as temperature independent, which was
inconsistent with experimental results. Thermodynamic
description of the binary liquid phase has significant im-
pact on the liquidus surface in higher-order systems.
Only proper thermodynamic descriptions of the binary
liquid phase as the full description of this study would
result in proper thermodynamic descriptions of higher-
order systems and ensure predictions of proper phase
diagrams of multicomponent systems.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
Thermodynamic descriptions of the Cu–Zn system
have been successfully reassessed using the CALPHAD
method. A simplified description of  phase and new
thermodynamic parameters of the liquid phase are pro-
posed. The order–disorder transformation of the –
phases is neglected in the simplified description, which is
useful for higher-order systems when inadequate experi-
mental information does not allow for full description of

4. Optimization procedure
The thermodynamic parameters for both phases in the sys-
tem were optimized using ThermoCalc v. S software [24].
Results were checked additionally using Pandat v.8 soft-
ware [25]. For this optimization, thermodynamic data for
the liquid (activities, chemical potential and enthalpy of
mixing) and hexagonal_A8 phase (enthalpy of formation)
as well as solidus and liquidus data were used. Each piece
of the selected information was given a certain weight
based on personal judgment. The optimization was carried
out step by step in agreement with the guideline given by
Schmid-Fetzer et al. [26]. First, the optimization of the liq-
uid phasewas performed, and then the hexagonal_A8 phase
was assessed. All parameters were finally evaluated to-
gether to provide the best description of the system. The
calculated interaction parameters are gathered in Table 2.
5. Results and discussion
The calculated phase diagram superimposed with experi-
mental data obtained by Pellini and Vio [14], by Kimata
[15], by Lanyon [16], and by Kotkata et al. [17] is shown
in Figs. 1 and 2. Figure 1 exhibits the phase diagram to-
gether with experimental data of the liquidus line; Figure 2
shows the phase diagram with experimental information
about the solidus. In addition, Fig. 2 presents the phase dia-
gram proposed by Gosh et al. [21] (marked by dashed
lines). The calculated solidus and liquidus lines agree with

[27]. The use of the associated solution model was sug-
gested by a shape of the enthalpy of mixing of the liquid
phase and literature information. The smaller number of
coefficients did not result in a good agreement between cal-
culation and experiment. The associated solution model
gave a good description of the system up to 900 K. Above
this temperature we found an unwanted miscibility gap.
Due to low temperature of vaporization equal to 957.8 K
and 1263 K for selenium and tellurium, respectively, our
calculationwas performed up to 1500 K. It is worth to men-
tion that SGTE database [22] provides information Gibbs
energies of Se in different phases up to 1000 K. Thus all
calculation above this temperature are prediction only.
6. Summary
A new thermodynamic approach of the binary selenium–
tellurium system was proposed. The associate solution
model for describing thermodynamic properties of the liq-
uid phase was used. Good agreement between calculation
and experiments was obtained.

Introduction 
 Soldering is very important for an electronic industry. 
 Lead – free soldering is essential for a new, 
environment friendly production. 
 The lead – free solders should have chemical and 
physical properties similar to Pb37Sn solder 
 There are many alloys which are promising lead – free 
solders; one of them is a quaternary Ag – Cu – In – Sn.

Conclusions 
 A new, consistent thermodynamic description of the binary Ag – 
In, Ag – Sn, Cu – In and Cu – Sn was proposed. 
 A new description of the ternary Ag – Cu – In, Ag – Cu – Sn, Ag – 
In – Sn and Cu – In – Sn was proposed. 
 Good agreement between thermodynamic modeling and 
experimental data was obtained for binary systems as well as for 
ternary systems. 
 A quaternary Ag – Cu – In – Sn system was modeled. A good 
agreement between simulation of solidification of promising 
solder alloy and DSC experiment has been found. 
 Obtained thermodynamic database allows to calculate 
thermodynamic properties, phase equilibria and solidification 
paths for quaternary system as well as for ternary and binary 
systems.

 Empirical approaches: 
 
Q = A Tm (A – parameter 38 cal/mol for FCC, 32.5 for BCC) – J. Askill 
 
Q = 700/ ( - coefficient of linear expansion at RT) – G. Askill 
 
Q = (K0+V) R Tm (K0 = 14 for BCC, 17 for FCC and HCP, 21 for diamond, 
              V – valence of the metal) – O. D. Sherby 
 
Q = R Tm (K+1.5V) (K = 13 for BCC, 15.5 for FCC and HCP, 20 for  
  diamond) – A. D. Leclair

Report from the conference TMS Annual Meeting 2011 
San Diego, CA 02/27 – 03/03 2011 
 
The TMS meeting 2011 has been held in San Diego, CA, between February 27
th
 and March3
rd
. I 
left Taiwan on Saturday, February 26
th
 and arrived to San Diego on the same day. On Sunday, 
February 27
th
, I attended The Phase Alloy Committee meeting.  During the meeting we discussed 
future work of the committee and listened to the committee chairman who referred previous 
works done by the committee. Finally we accepted an application of a new member of the 
Committee – Dr. Chia-Ming Hsu from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan. 
The first regular day of the conference was on Monday, 28
th
 February. I attended different 
sessions and listened presentations which were in agreement with my scientific interest. On 
Wednesday, 2
nd
 March I have presented my presentation at the Symposium “Phase Stability, 
Phase Transformations, and Reactive Phase Formation in Electronic Materials X”. The title of 
the presentation was “Thermodynamic description of the Ag – Cu – In – Sn system”.  The 
presentation showed results of the work on the scientific project supported by NSC under grant 
no. 99-2218-E-155-005. The co-author of the presentation is Mr. Kai-Chien Zhang who was a 
student worked on the project. The presentation was received with interest. The short discussion 
after the presentation took a place. Professor I. Ohnuma from Tohoku University, Japan, was 
interested in method of calculation of the solidification path and Professor S.-w. Chen from 
National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, gave very important comment about choosing a 
composition of the calculation. The presentation is enclosed to the report as an Apendix 1. The 
next day, March 3
rd
 was the last day of conference. On that day afternoon I was a chairman of 
the afternoon session of the Symposium “Phase Stability, Phase Transformations, and Reactive 
Phase Formation in Electronic Materials X”. Unfortunately, because it was the last session and 
the last day of the conference, the attendance was not very good – there were only few people at 
the session room. 
I flew back to Taiwan on the same day evening, and I arrived to Taoyuan Airport on Saturday, 
March 5
th
. I think that the conference gave me a great opportunity for learning new things and 
make new international connections. I’m very thankful for the financial support under grants 99-
2218-E-155-005 and 99-2221-E-155-016.
