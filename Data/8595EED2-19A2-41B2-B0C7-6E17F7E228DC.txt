Abstract 
Globalization of production has altered the 
configuration of supply chains in many 
industries. Besides outsourcing, joint ventures 
and strategic alliances are increasingly 
established to create competitive production 
organizations. In this project we study the case 
of tapered technology-manufacturing alliance 
between a process technology firm with captive 
manufacturing capability and an efficient 
manufacturing firm in an asset-heavy industry. 
A framework of economic analysis is first 
developed for fusing the factors of technology 
licensing, manufacturing efficiency, risk sharing, 
and demand uncertainty. Analysis methods of 
capacity economics are next described for 
participation analysis, capacity allocation, and 
contract term tradeoffs.  
Keywords: Supply chain configuration; 
Technology-manufacturing alliances; 
Economic analysis; Capacity allocation 
二、緣由與目的 
To maintain competitiveness in high-tech 
manufacturing capabilities, firms must 
continuously invest in precision machinery and 
capacity. However, market demand is often 
uncertain or volatile. Escalating investment 
requirements, risk of equipment obsolescence 
and uncertain demand together create serious 
cash flow problems. Furthermore, when 
manufacturers cannot afford expensive 
machinery, the equipment industry will have less 
demand for its products. In the case of 
semiconductor manufacturing, this problem is so 
3 
and c2, respectively. The plant capacities are k1 
and k2. The capacity investment costs are c1k1 
and c2k2. Firm F1 sells the product as a name 
brand and the gross profit margin is p1. Firm F1 
is entitled to buy back the same fraction of M2’s 
output at a favorable transfer price βp1. The 
balance of M2’s output is sold by firm F2 into 
the market as a generic brand product at a gross 
profit margin p2. 
 
Figure 2. A conceptual framework for production 
economics analysis 
Figure 3 illustrates a decision logic flow for 
analyzing the feasibility of alliance.  
(1) Individual capacity decisions: This is an 
initialization step. 
(2) Check the feasibility of forming an alliance: 
The checking will yield one of two 
outcomes: feasible or infeasible. If the 
alliance turns out to be feasible based on 
individual firm’s capacity decision, it will 
be called a natural alliance in this paper.  
(3) If step 2 yields a negative outcome, 
reconcile the two capacity levels (k1 and k2) 
to create a more favorable basis for 
forming an alliance. This step will yield 
one of two outcomes: feasible or 
improbable. Adjusting the capacity levels 
amounts to redistributing the risk sharing. 
If reconciliation cannot be struck, we will 
say that an alliance is improbable. 
(4) Terms of alliance are negotiated to 
determine the distribution of profit between 
firms. 
 
Figure 3. A process of alliance formation analysis 
 In this project, we have derived production 
economic conditions for TM alliances. They are 
presented as two propositions: participation 
constraint and plausible alliance constraint. 
The profit functions for firms F1 and F2 can be 
expressed, respectively, as: 
1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2[ (1 ) (1 ) ]p p p c k c kπ ω α β α γ ω α= ⋅ + − + − ⋅ − −
2 1 2 2 2 2[ (1 )(1 ) ] (1 )p p c kπ αβ α γ ω α= + − − ⋅ − −   
Define the returns on asset (ROA) investment as 
the profit divided by capacity investment cost. 
Denote the ROA of firm i as Ri, i∈(1,2).

Proposition 1 (participation constraint):  
Firm F1’s tendency is to have minimal stake 
in the joint venture, if

Managerial insights: 
(1) The license rate is a discriminating 
parameter. The rate will change the feasible 
domain of α and determine the economic 
feasibility of alliance.
