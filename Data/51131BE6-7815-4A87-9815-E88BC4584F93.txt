I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, wireless location estimation has
attracted a significant amount of attention from
industry and academia. A variety of techniques have
been developed for determining the locations of mo-
bile stations (MSs) [1], [2]. In mobile based location
estimation framework, although global positioning
system (GPS) can fulfill the demands of navigation
and location services, the coverage and location
quality are generally affected by obstacle of signals
and weather conditions. In addition, the penetration
rate of the MSs with an embedded GPS receiver
in the market is still not high enough. Most MS
users may need to rely on network-based solutions,
in which the location of an MS is determined
from the location metrics between the MS and the
base stations (BSs). Particularly in the middle of
natural disasters or unforeseen accidence, survivors’
locations may be known to the outside world only
with the help of location-based signals that are
collected by communications services. Therefore,
how to ensure normal operations of location devices
and maintain generally acceptable position tracking
performance is essential in the wireless location
services [3]–[5].
For the demands of communications and wireless
location, a mobile base station (MBS) with high
mobility may be used in supporting the rescue
operation in disaster time. The concept of MBS
can be utilized for communication and location in
wireless systems. The mobility of an MBS will
not only relieve the problem of poor signals in
communications, but also supplement the perfor-
mance of wireless location and target positioning.
With functional enhancement, the usage of the
MBSs for both wireless location and communica-
tions may become feasible in the new generation
of heterogeneous wireless communication systems.
For instance, through the deployment of mobile
relay stations in the IEEE 802.16j system [6], the
coverage and quality of wireless communications
may be enhanced. The inclusion of an MBS into
the existent geometric BS layout should be able to
provide more flexibility in both service coverage and
location functions.
In addition, short-range or indoor wireless loca-
tion systems based on IEEE 802.11 wireless local
area networks, IEEE 802.15.4 wireless personal
area networks, ZigBee, or Ultra-wideband (UWB)
wireless communication techniques [7]–[10] may
also find applications of the MBS concepts. With
proper path planning for the MBS in the existent
geometric layout of fixed BSs, the MBS may pro-
vide more useful measurements through a wireless
data collecting system. The location device elements
may use the location technology to calculate the
relevant position and angle of the target (or MS),
and relay the results for further processing. As for
surveillance and target tracking in wireless sensor
networks [11]–[15], the MBS (or mobile node) can
collect information through relocation and flexible
deployment, and enhances the location accuracy and
efficiency. With its deployment flexibility, an MBS
can be relocated to the “best location” to obtain the
maximum gain in wireless location accuracy.
II. GDOP EFFECTS AND MOBILE BASE
STATION
The time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) location
method [16] has the advantage of high location
accuracy, and does not require synchronization be-
tween the BSs and the target. It is noted, however,
when comparing with time-of-arrival (TOA) meth-
ods, the location errors in TDOA location methods
are more sensitive to the geometric formation of BSs
and the interested target.
The geometric relationship between the BSs and
the MS may affect the accuracy of MS location
estimate, and the error effect is referred as the
geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). The GDOP
value represents the ratio of location error to the
measurement noise. Given the geometric location
layout of the BSs and MS, the GDOP can be
calculated accordingly. In 2-D environment [17],
the GDOP in estimating the location [x y]T can be
written as
GDOP =
√
var(x)+var(y)
σR
(1)
A higher GDOP value indicates larger location error
in the location estimator.
A. GDOP Effects in TDOA Location System
The theoretical GDOP values in TDOA wireless
location system can be derived as follows. In a

at 67% and 95% of the CDF are listed in Table I.
It can be seen that the GDOP value increases as the
MS is located away from the central area enclosed
by the BSs.
B. Reducing GDOP Effects by Mobile Base Station
To reduce the GDOP effect in TDOA location
system, the usage of an MBS is considered. Chang-
ing the geometric layout formed by a set of BSs
and the target (MS) by incorporating a new MBS

BSs)
or relocating an existing MBS, the GDOP effect will
be altered. The GDOP value can be represented as
GDOP = G(pBS1 , · · · ,pBSN ,pT). (13)
If there are M MBSs in the system, (13) can be
rewritten as
GDOP=G(pBS1 , · · · ,pBSN−M ,pMBS1 , · · · ,pMBSM ,pT)
(14)
where pT = [xT yT]T , pMBSi = [xMBSiyMBSi ]
T
, and
pBS j =
[
xBS jyBS j
]T
, with i = 1,2, · · · ,M, j =
1,2, · · · ,N−M.
If the locations of the target and BSs are fixed,
except the MBSs, an alternative form of the G
function can be formulated. If there are M MBSs, a
GDOP distribution GT can be defined with respect
to the locations of MBSs, and written as
GT(pMBS1 , · · · ,pMBSM) = G(pBS1 , · · · ,pBSN−M ,
pMBS1 , · · · ,pMBSM ,pT)
(15)
Fig. 3 is obtained from a case with two fixed
BSs and one MBS. When the MBS resides at a
location so that the MS is inside the area enclosed
by the MBS and fixed BSs, the GDOP value is
comparatively smaller than those where the MS
locates outside.
III. BEST LOCATION AND PATH PLANNING
FOR THE MBSS
Under the assumption that the MS location re-
mains unchanged, the best MBS location and the
related path planning approaches are studied. When

Fig. 6. GT function value along a relocation path of the MBS
each step on the relocation path of the MBSs is
illustrated in Fig. 6. Simulation results show that
the proposed approach can effectively find the best
location for the MBS to relocate. Applying the path
planning and MBS relocation, the GDOP effects can
be effectively reduced, yielding improved accuracy
in the MS location estimation.
C. GDOP Improvement for a Moving Target
In scenarios where the interested target or mo-
bile station (MS) is on the move, since the target
constantly changes its location, the GDOP distribu-
tion for the target will be altered accordingly. The
values of GT will therefore become a time-varying
distribution. To establish a new distribution of GT at
a time instant, the target location needs to be esti-
mated first. In the time-difference of arrival (TDOA)
wireless location system, range differences between
a reference sensor node and any other sensor node

Fig. 7. Simulation result for teh case with one MBS (MSN)
may be used to form hyperbolic curves. In 2-D
environment, at least three sensor nodes, including
the reference node, are needed for TDOA location.
The target can be localized at the intersection of
any two pairs of hyperbolic curves. It is however
not straightforward to obtain the target location by
solving the equations. An extended Kalman filtering
(EKF) formulation based on the TDOA method is
used in predicting the target location. By forming
the GDOP distribution from the predicted target
location, the “best locations” for the MBSs can
be obtained. Based on the deployment flexibility,
MBSs can be relocated to the “best locations” to
attain the maximum improvement for every tracking
epoch in wireless localization.
To illustrate the performance of the proposed
schemes, simulation results for the case with a
single MBS (denoted as mobile sensor node, MSN)
is shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 8, the difference of
GT values between the new MSN locations and
the predicted best locations are depicted. Simulation
results show that, even in the cases with moving
targets, the proposed approach can effectively search
the best locations for an MBS (or MSN) to relocate.
With the relocation and path planning, the GDOP
effects are significantly reduced.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND SELF-EVALUATION
In the wireless location environment, the accuracy
of location may be affected by geometric factors
including the geometric dilution of precision. Re-
ducing the GDOP effect will be able to improve the
