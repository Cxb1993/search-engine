more cautious with the investment on the web companies after the internet bubble in the late 
of 1990. People believe the tendency of internet won’t cease moving. But how to evaluate the 
health or growth of a web company becomes an interesting and important topic to investors.  
A website usually has multi functions, which combine contents, members and 
commerce to attract the web users and reach the beneficial purpose of web execution. The 
websites face serious challenges because too many analogous websites share the same market. 
In order to increase the number of members and income, the executors of community 
websites will update the web contents and functions persistently to improve the survival 
conditions under this field of severe competition. Therefore, when a website hasn’t reached a 
large enough and steady profit size, the financial index fluctuate easily due to the service 
updating risk. A web company may burn a lot of money before it can create profit. Investors 
and executive managers of web companies need a predicting model to predict or monitor the 
performance of execution before the web companies have meaningful and steady financial 
indexes. Most of the predicting models are based on financial ratios, but these are not suitable 
for those web companies haven’t entered stock market or their financial variables are instable. 
In this research, we intend to reveal some non-financial indexes as variables of predicting 
model to distinguish the health status and in-danger status compared with their own past 
records.  
Regarding the predicting model, some researchers used static models based on 
discriminant analysis (Altman, 1968, 1983), regression (Ohlson, 1980; Zmijewski, 1984), 
neural networks (Odom & Sharda, 1990; Coats & Fant, 1993; Altman et al., 1994; Koh and 
Tan, 1999), decision tree (Tam & Kiang, 1992), or machine learning method (Shin et al., 2005) 
to evaluate periodically whether the company is in health. In this research, we agreed with the 
discussion of Theodossiou (1993) that a company’s deteriorating condition are produced 
sequentially for a long time before the failure. The multivariate cumulative sum (CUSUM) 
procedure (Healy, 1987) can cumulate the deteriorating signals sequentially such that we can 
detect a company’s slide toward failure at an early enough stage to remedy it. Our dynamic 
executive predicting model (DEP Model) is to integrate the techniques of CUSUM, 
discriminant analysis and vector autoregressive model (VAR). The difference of other 
predicting models such as Theodossiou’s model and our dynamic executive predicting (DEP) 
model is that the former constructed by financial ratios of independent health and failure 
companies, but the latter from the past good and bad performances of a company.  
The article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the theory of cumulative sum 
chart. Our main theory of DEP is to use the multivariate CUSUM for auto-correlated data 
given in Section 3. Section 4 is to build a DEP model by an experimental real life data from a 
community website. Section 5 is our concluding remarks.

The univariate variable  is a linear combination of random variable tZ tε . If random 
variable tε  is normal distributed, the variable  is also normal. The expected value of  
is .5D when  is in good performance state. Otherwise, the expected value of  is -.5D 
when  is in bad performance state. The variance of  is one no matter  is in good or 
bad. We can substitute variable  into univariate CUSUM equation (2) and use the general 
recommendation as Table 1 in the parameter given, K = .5

4. Business Executive Variables and Model Application 
4.1 Executive Variable Selection 
The variables considered are based on the interview of four CEOs of web companies in 
Taiwan. In this research, we choose day as our time unit. The variables, daily consuming 
amount and daily total visiting number, have the first highest scores in our interview. They got 
18 points with total 20 points. From researches, stickiness has high correlation with success of 
web execution (Gillespie et al., 1999) (Mohamed et al., 2002). The indexes of stickiness 
include user staying time, frequency and depth. Depth is a quantitative variable. We use five 
variables to cover these four characters. They are staying hour (Hours), consuming amount 
(Amount) , total visiting number (Visiting) (including all the log-in number per day), 
consumer number (Consumer) and total consuming number (Consuming) (including all the 
number of visit with consuming). 
 
coefficient estimations of discriminant analysis, β1, variable “consumers” has the largest 
weight in this experimental case. It shows how many visitors will really take purchasing is the 
most important variable in the performance of executive business.

5. Conclusion 
Web market is one of the consuming routes. A lot of ecommerce developers set their 
heart pursuing a success executive model in this market. The transactions in website are 
digitalized. Simple statistics are not precise enough to display executive status. The executors 
of online companies need a simple and accurate model to reveal their timely executive 
information in this ecommerce market. In this research, we propose a DEP model combines 
the techniques of discriminant analysis, time-series analysis and multivariate CUSUM which 
combines several variables as a univariate CUSUM. This model can cumulate the executive 
information by time and give the executors timely warning signals if the executive status
