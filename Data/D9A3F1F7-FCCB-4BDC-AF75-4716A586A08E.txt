一、英文摘要
Let P1 = <v1, v2, v3, . . . ,vn> and P2 = <u1, u2, u3, . . . , un> be two hamiltonian paths of G. We say
that P1 and P2 are independent if u1 = v1, un = vn, and ui <> vi for 1 < i < n. We say a set of
hamiltonian paths P1, P2, . . . , Ps of G between two distinct vertices are mutually independent if
any two distinct paths in the set are independent. We use n to denote the number of vertices and
use e to denote the number of edges in graph G. Moreover, we use e’to denote the number of
edges in the complement of G. Suppose that G is a graph with e≤ n−4 and n≥ 4. We prove that
there are at least n−2−e’mutually independent hamiltonian paths between any pair of distinct
vertices of G except n = 5 and e’= 1. Assume that G is a graph with the degree sum of any two
non-adjacent vertices being at least n + 2. Let u and v be any two distinct vertices of G. We prove
that there are degG(u) + degG(v)−n mutually independent hamiltonian paths between u and v if (u,
v) ∈ E(G) and there are degG(u) + degG(v) −n +2 mutually independent hamiltonian paths
between u and v if otherwise. A cubic graph G is 2-independent Hamiltonian connected if there
are two independent Hamiltonian paths between any two different vertices of G. A graph G is
1-Hamiltonianif G − F is Hamiltonian for any F ⊆ V ∪ E with |F| = 1. A graph G is super 3∗
-connected if there exist i internal disjoint paths spanning G for i = 1, 2, 3. It is proved that every
super 3∗-connected graph is 1-Hamiltonian. We prove that every cubic 2- independent
Hamiltonian connected graph is also 1-Hamiltonian. We present some cubic 2-independent
Hamiltonian connected graphs that are super 3∗-connected, some cubic 2-independent
Hamiltonian connected graphs that are not super 3∗-connected, some super 3∗-connected graphs
that are not 2-independent Hamiltonian connected, and some cubic 1-Hamiltonian graphs that are
Hamiltonian connected but neither 2-independent Hamiltonian connected nor super 3∗-connected.
A bipartite graph G is hamiltonian laceable if there exists a hamiltonian path joining any two
nodes from different partite sets. A bipartite graph is k-mutually independent hamiltonian
laceable if there exist k-mutually independent hamiltonian paths between any two nodes from
different partite sets. The mutually independent hamiltonian laceability of bipartite graph G,
IHPL(G), is the maximum integer k such that G is k-mutually independent hamiltonian laceable.
Let Qn be the n-dimensional hypercube. We prove that IHPL(Qn) = 1 if ∈ {1; 2; 3}, and
4denotes its degree in G. Two vertices u and v are adjacent if (u, v) ∈ E. A path P is represented
by <v0, v1, v2, . . . , vk>. A path is a hamiltonian path if its vertices are distinct and span V. A
graph G is hamiltonian connected if there exists a hamiltonian path joining any two vertices of G.
A cycle is a path with at least three vertices such that the first vertex is the same as the last one. A
hamiltonian cycle of G is a cycle that traverses every vertex of G exactly once. There are a lot of
studies on hamiltonian connected graphs. In this work, we are interested in another aspect of
hamiltonian connected graphs. Let P1 = <v1, v2, v3, . . . , vn> and P2 = <u1, u2, u3, . . . , un> be any
two hamiltonian paths of G. We say that P1 and P2 are independent if u1 = v1, un = vn, and ui <> vi
for 1 < i < n. We say a set of hamiltonian paths P1, P2, . . . , Ps of G are mutually independent if
any two distinct paths in the set are independent. In [4], it is proved that there exist (k − 2) 
mutually independent hamiltonian paths between any two vertices from different bipartite sets of
the star graph Sk if k ≥ 4. The concept of mutualy independent hamiltonian arises from the 
following application. If there are k pieces of data needed to be sent from u to v, and the data
needed to be processed at every node (and the process takes times), then we want mutually
independent hamiltonian paths so that there will be no waiting time at a processor. The existence
of mutually independent hamiltonian paths is useful for communication algorithms. Motivated by
this result, we begin the study on graphs with mutually independent hamiltonian paths between
every pair of distinct vertices. In this work, we are interested in two families of graphs. The first
family of graphs e’ ≤ n − 4. It wasproved [5] that such graphs are hamiltonian connected. In this
work, we strengthen this classical result by proving that there are at least n−2− e’mutually
independent hamiltonian paths between every pair of distinct vertices of G. The second family of
graphs are those graphs with the sum of the degree of any two non-adjacent vertices being at least
n +1. It was proved [3] that such graphs are hamiltonian connected. We then further assume that
G is a graph with the sum of any two non-adjacent vertices being at least n + 2. Let u and v be
any two distinct vertices of G. Then there are degG(u) + degG(v) −n mutually independent
hamiltonian paths between u and v if (u, v) ∈ E(G), and there are degG(u)+degG(v)−n+2
mutually independent hamiltonian paths between u and v otherwise. Throughout this work, we
wil use [i ] to denote i mod (n − 2).Let G and H be two graphs. We use G + H to denote the
disjoint union of G and H. We use G ∨ H to denote the graph obtained from G + H by joining
each vertex of G to each vertex of H. For1 ≤ m < n/2, let Cm,n denote the graph (K¯ m + Kn−2m)
∨ Km; see Fig. 1. The following theorem is proved by Chvátal [2].
Theorem 1 ([2]). Assume that G is a graph with n ≥ 3 and e’ ≤ n−3. ThenG is hamiltonian. 
Moreover, the only non-hamiltonian graphs with e’ ≤ n − 2 are C1,n and C2,5.
The following lemma is obvious.
Lemma 1. Let u and v be two distinct vertices of G. Then there are at most min{degG(u), degG(v)}
mutually independent hamiltonian paths between u and v if (u, v) ~∈ E(G), and there are at
6and (i, t) ∈ E(G)}. Since e’ = n−4, |Q| ≥ n−2−(n−4) = 2. There are at least two elements inQ.
Let q1 and q2 be the two elements in Q. For j = 1, 2, we set Pj as <s, [qj +1], [qj +2], . . . , [qj ], t>.
Then P1 and P2 are two independent hamiltonian paths between s and t.
Case 2: H is non-hamiltonian. There are exactly (n −2) vertices in H. By Theorem 1, there are 
exactly(n − 4) edges in the complement of H and H is isomorphic to C1,n−2or C2,5. Since e’ = n − 
4, we know that (s, v) ∈ E(G) and (t, v) ∈ E(G) for every vertex v in H. We can construct two
independent hamiltonian paths between s and t as following cases:
Subcase 2.1: H is isomorphic to C2,5. We label the vertices of C2,5 with {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} as shown in
Fig. 2(a). Let P1 = <s, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, t> and P2 = <s, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0, t>. Then P1 and P2 form the
required independent paths.
Subcase 2.2: H is isomorphic to C1,n−2. We label the vertices of C1,n−2 with {0, 1, . . . , n−3} as 
shown in Fig. 2(b). Let P1 = <s, 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 3, t> and P2 = <s, 2, 3, . . . , n − 3, 1, 0, t>. Then
P1 and P2 form the required independent paths.
We can further strengthen Theorem 3:
Theorem 6. Assume that G is a graph with n ≥ 4 and e’ ≤ n − 4. Then there are n − 2 − e’
mutually independent hamiltonian paths between every two distinct vertices of G except n = 5
and e’= 1.
Proof. With Lemma 2, the theorem for e’ = n − 4 holds.Now, we need to prove the theorem for
e’ = n − 4 − r with 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 4. Let s and t be two distinct vertices of G. Let H be the subgraph 
ofG induced by the remaining (n − 2) vertices of G.Then there are exactly (n −2) vertices in H 
and there are at most n −4−r edges in the complementof H with 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 4. By Theorem 1, H 
is hamiltonian. We can label the vertices of H with{0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 3} so that <0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 
3, 0> forms a hamiltonian cycle of H. Let Q denote the set {i | (s, [i + 1]) ∈ E(G) and (t, i ) ∈
E(G)}. Since e’ = n − 4 − r with 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 4, weknow that |Q| ≥ n − 2 − (n − 4 − r ) = n − 2 − e’
for 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 4. Hence, there are at least n − 2− e’elements in Q. Let q1, q2, . . . , qn−2−e’ be the
elements in Q. For j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 2 − e’, we set Pj = <s, [qj +1], [qj +2], . . . , [qj ], t>. It is not

This family of cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian connected graphs is very closely related to the
family of cubic 1-Hamiltonian graphs. A graph G is 1-Hamiltonian if G −F is Hamiltonian for
any F \in V∪ E with |F| = 1. A 1-Hamiltonian graph is optimal if it contains the least number of
edges among all l-Hamiltonian graphs with the same number of vertices. It is proved that any
cubic 1-Hamiltonian graph is optimal (Harary and Hayes 1993, 1996). We will prove that every
cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian connected graphs is also 1-Hamiltonian. The family of cubic
2-independent Hamiltonian connected graphs is also very closely related to the family of super
3∗-connected graphs. A k-container C(u, v) is a set of k internal vertex disjoint paths joining u
and v. The connectivity of G,κ(G), is the minimum number of vertices whose removal leaves the
remaining graph disconnected or trivial. A graph G is k-connected if κ(G) ≥ k. It follows from
Menger’sTheorem that there are k internal vertex disjoint paths joining any two vertices u and v
if G is k-connected. A k*-container C(u, v) of G is a k-container such that every vertex of G is
incident with some path in C(u, v). A graph is k*-connected if there exists a k*-container C(u, v)
between any two distinct vertices u and v. Obviously, a graph G is 1*-connected if and only if it
is Hamiltonian connected. Moreover, a graph G is 2*-connected if and only if it is Hamiltonian. It
is known that every Hamiltonian connected graph with at least three vertices is Hamiltonian.
Thus, every 1*-connected graph with at least three vertices is also 2*-connected. In particular,
every cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian connected graph is i*-connected with i = 1, 2.We also
note that every 1-Hamiltonian graph G is Hamiltonian because G−e is Hamiltonian for any edge e
in G. Thus, every 1-Hamiltonian graph is 2*-connected. Thus, the concept of k*-connected is a
hybrid concept of hamiltonicity and connectivity. The concept of k*-connected is proposed by
Lin et al. (2005), which is motivated by the concept of globally 3*-connected graphs proposed by
Albert, Aldred, and Holton (2001). A globally 3*-connected graph is a cubic 3*-connected graph.
It is proved in (Kao et al. 2007) that every globally 3*-connected graph is 1-Hamiltonian. Thus,
every globally 3*-connected is also 2*-connected. However, not every globally 3*-connected
graph is 1*-connected. Thus, Kao et al. (2007) introduce the concept of super 3*-connected. A
super 3*-connected graph is a cubic graph that is i*-connected for i = 1, 2, 3. In Fig. 1, we use
Venn diagram to illustrate the relation between cubic 1-hamiltonian graphs, globally
3*-connected graphs, super 3*-connected graphs, cubic Hamiltonian connected graphs, and cubic
2-independent Hamiltonian connected graphs. The set of cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian
connected graphs corresponds to regions 1 and 2; the set of cubic 1-Hamiltonian graphs
corresponds to regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; the set of globally 3*-connected graphs corresponds to
regions 2, 4, and 5; the set of cubic Hamiltonian connected graphs corresponds to regions 1, 2, 3,
4, and 7; the set of super 3*-connected graphs corresponds to regions 2 and 4.

≤ i < n}.
Theorem 6 P(n, 1) is cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian connected and super 3*-connected if and
only if n is odd.
Proof It is proved in (Kao et al. 2007) that P(n, 1) is super 3*-connected if and only if n is odd. It
is easy to see that P(n, 1) is bipartite if and only if n is even. Thus, we consider the case n is odd.
We will prove that there exist two independent Hamiltonian paths between any two different
vertices.
Let n = 2k + 1. To describe the require Hamiltonian paths, we use the following path patterns. Let
P(i,j) denote the path <i, i⊕ 1, . . . , j -1, j>, Q(i, j) denote the path <i, (i ⊕ 1), . . . , (j - 1), j>,
and M(i, j) denote the path <i, (i⊕ 1), i⊕ 1, i ⊕ 2, (i⊕ 2), (i⊕ 3), . . . , j- 1, (j - 1)’, j>. See
Fig. 3 for illustrations. We also use P¯(j, i) to denote the path (P (i, j ))−1, Q¯ (j, i) to denote the
path (Q(i, j))−1, and M¯ (j, i) to denote the path (M(i, j))−1. By the symmetric property of P(2k
+1, 1), we only need to find two independent Hamiltonian paths P1 and P2 between 0 to any
vertex x in {1, 2, . . . , k, 0, 1, . . . , k}. We have the following cases:
Case 1: x = 0. Set P1 = <0,P¯(2k, 1),Q(1, (2k)), 0> and P2 = <0,P(1, 2k), Q¯ ((2k), 1), 0>. See Fig.
4(a). From the figure, it is easy to see that P1 and P2 are independent.
Case 2: x = 1. Set P1 = <0,P¯(2k, 2),Q(2, 0), 1, 1> and P2 = <0, 0, Q(1, (2k)),P¯(2k, 2), 1>. See
Fig. 4(b). From the figure, it is easy to see that P1 and P2 are independent.
Case 3: x = k and k is odd. Set P1 = <0,P¯(2k, k + 1), Q((k + 1), (2k)), M(0, k), k> and P2 =
<0,M(0, k), Q((k + 1), (2k)),P¯(2k, k + 1), k>. See Fig. 4(c). From the figure, it is easy to see that
P1 and P2 are independent.
Case 4: x = k and k is even. Set P1 = <0,P(1, k−1), Q¯ ((k−1), 1),M¯ (0, k), k> and P2 = <0,M¯ (0,
k), Q¯ ((k−1), 1),P(1, k−1), k>. See Fig. 4(d). It is easy to see that P1 and P2 are independent.
Case 5: x = 2i + 1 for some positive integer i. Set P1 = <0,P¯(2k, x + 1), Q((x + 1), (2k)),M(0, x),
x> and P2 = <0,M(0, x), Q((x + 1), (2k)), P¯(2k, x +1), x>. See Fig. 4(e). It is easy to see that P1
and P2 are independent.
Case 6: x = 2i for some positive integer i. Set P1 = <0,P(1, x−1), Q¯ ((x−1), 1),M¯ (0, x), x> and
P2 = <0,M¯ (0, x), Q¯ ((x−1), 1),P(1, x−1), x>. See Fig. 4(f). It is easy to see that P1 and P2 are
independent.
Case 7: x = 1 and k is odd. Set P1 = <0,M¯ (0, 2), 2, 1, 1> and P2 = <0, 1, 2, M¯ (2, 0), 1>. See
Fig. 4(g). It is easy to see that P1 and P2 are independent.
Case 8: x = 1 and k is even. Set P1 = <0,M¯ (0, 2), 2, 1, 1> and P2 = <0, 1, 2,M¯ (2, 0), 1>. See
Fig. 4(h). It is easy to see that P1 and P2 are independent.
Case 9: x = k and k is odd. Set P1 = <0,M¯ (0, (k + 1)), k + 1, k, P¯(k−1, 1),Q(1, (k−1)), k> and
P2 = <0,P(1, k−1), Q¯ ((k−1), 1), M¯ (0, (k + 1)), k + 1, k, k>. With Fig. 4(i), it is easy to see
that P1 and P2 are independent.
Case 10: x = k and k is even. Set P1 = <0,M(0, (k−1)), k−1, k, P(k + 1, 2k), Q¯ ((2k), (k + 1)),
k> and P2 = <0,P¯(2k, k + 1), Q((k + 1), (2k)) M(0, (k−1)), k−1, k, k>. With Fig. 4( j), it is easy
to see that P1 and P2 are independent.

In this section, we present a family of super 3*-connected graph that are not cubic 2-independent
Hamiltonian connected. Again, we use ⊕ and _ to denote addition and subtraction in integer
modulo n,Zn. The ladder graph L(k) is the graph with vertex set {0, 1, . . . , 2k−1} and edge set
{(i, 2k−i) | 1≤ i < k} {∪ (i, i⊕ 1) | 0≤ i≤ 2k−1} {∪ (0, k)}. The ladder graphs L(3) and L(4)
are shown in Fig. 5.
Theorem 7 L(k) is super 3*-connected but not cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian connected if k is
even and k≥ 4.
Proof It is proved in (Albert et al. 2001) that any L(k) is globally 3*-connected. And it is proved
in (Moon 1965) that L(k) is Hamiltonian connected. Hence, L(k) is super 3*-connected. Now, we
want to show that L(k) is not cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian connected if k is even and k ≥ 4.
We only prove that L(4) is not cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian connected. Using the same
technique, it is easy to see that L(k) is not cubic 2-independent Hamiltonian connected if k is even
and k ≥ 4. By brute force, it is easy to see that there are only two Hamiltonian paths between 1
and 7, namely <1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 4, 0, 7> and <1, 0, 4, 5, 3, 2, 6, 7>. Apparently, these two
Hamiltonian paths are not independent.
In this section, we will prove that the graph N in Fig. 6 is 2-independent Hamiltonian connected
but not super 3*-connected. Obviously, N is obtained from K3,3 by a sequence of 3-join with K4.
14
= <v1 = 14, v2, . . . , v48 = 48> be any Hamiltonian path of M between 14 and 48 in M. We claim
that v2 must be 15. Then M is not 2-independent Hamiltonian connected once our claim is proved.
To prove this claim, it is equivalent to show that the graph M3, shown in Fig. 8(b), is not
Hamiltonian. Repeatedly using Theorem 5, it is sufficient to show that the graph M4, shown in
Figure 8(c), is not Hamiltonian. Suppose there exists a Hamiltonian cycle H in M4. We can write
H as H = <49, 48, vx, . . . , vz, 49>. Obviously, vx is r14, or 41.
Case 1: vx = r14. Then neither (48, 37) nor (48, 41) is in H. Thus, both (37, 41) and (41, r12) are
in H. This implies the graph M4, shown in Fig. 8(c), has a Hamiltonian cycle C. And degM4 (r5)
= 2. Therefore, the graph M5, shown in Fig. 8(d), has a Hamiltonian cycle C. Since the graph M5
is planar, Grinberg condition (Grinberg 1968) is satisfied. Thus, 2(f’4−f”4 )+3(f’5−f”5)+9(f’11
−f”11) = 0 where f i is the number of faces of length i inside C and f”i is the number of faces of
length i outside C for i = 4, 5, 11. Obviously, 2(f’4−f”4 ) = 0 (mod 3). Since |f’4−f”4| = 1, the
equation cannot hold. We get a contradiction.
Case 2: vx = 41. Then neither (48, r14) nor (48, 37) is in H. Thus, both (48, 41) and (41, 37) are
in H. This implies the graph M6, shown in Fig. 8(e), has a Hamiltonian cycle C. Obviously,
degM6 (48) = degM6 (41) = degM6 (37) = degM6 (r5) = 2. Therefore, the graph M7, shown in Fig.
8(f), has a Hamiltonian cycle C. Since the graph M7 is planar, Grinberg condition (Grinberg 1968)
is satisfied. Thus, 2(f’4−f”4 ) + 3(f’5−f”5 ) + 6(f’8−f”8) = 0 where f’i is the number of faces
of length i inside C and f”i is the number of faces of length i outside C for i = 4, 5, 8. Obviously,
2(f’4−f”4 ) = 0 (mod 3). Since |f’4−f”4| = 1, the equation cannot hold. We get a contradiction.
From the discussion above, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 9 M is cubic 1-Hamiltonian, Hamiltonian connected but neither cubic 2-independent
Hamiltonian connected nor super 3*-connected.
16
C = <u = v1; v2,..., vn(G); v1> be any hamiltonian cycle of G beginning at u. Obviously, v2 ∈
NG(u). Thus, there are at most degG(u) mutually independent hamiltonian cycles in G beginning
at u. Thus, IHC(G) <= ±(G).
In this section, we prove that IHPL(Qn) = 1 if n ∈ {1; 2; 3} and IHPL(Qn) = n - 1 if n >= 4.
Moreover, IHC(Q1) = n - 1 if n ∈ {1; 2; 3} and IHC(Qn) = n if n >= 4.
Let u = u1 u2 ... un-1 un be an n-bit binary strings. For 1 <= i <= n, we use ui to denote the binary
string, v1 v2 ... vn-1 vn, such that vi = 1 - ui and vk = uk if k <> i. Moreover, we use (u)i to denote ui.
The Hamming weight of u, w(u), is {i | (u)i = 1; 1 <= i <= n }. The n-dimensional hypercube,
Qn, consists of all n-bit binary strings as its nodes. Two nodes u and v are adjacent if and only if v
= ui for some i and we called such edge (u, v) is an i-dimensional edge. Note that Qn is a bipartite
graph with bipartition {u | w(u) is odd} and {u | w(u) is even}. We use black nodes to denote
those nodes of odd weight and white nodes to denote those nodes of even weight. Let Qi n be the
subgraph of Qn induced by {u ∈ V (Qn) | (u)n = i} for i ∈ {0; 1} and let Qijn be the subgraph
of Qn induced by {u ∈ V (Qn) | (u)n-1 = i and (u)n = j} for i; j ∈ {0; 1}. Obviously, Qi n is
isomorphic to Qn-1 and Qij n is isomorphic to Qn-2. It is known that Qn is node transitive and edge
transitive. Furthermore, the permutation on the coordinates of Qn and the componentwise
complement operations are isomorphisms. We use e to denoted the 00 ... 0 of Qn. The antipodal
point of e, ~e, is the node 11 ... 1. Thus, (~e)i is the i-th neighbor of ~e. Let P = <x1; x2,..., x2n-1>
be any hamiltonian path of Qi n for i = 0; 1. We use eP to denote the hamiltonian path <x1; (x1)n;
(x2)n; x2; x3; (x3)n; (x4)n,..., (x2n-1-1)n; (x2n-1)n; x2n-1> of Qn.
Lemma 1 [4] Qn is hamiltonian laceable for any positive integer n.
Lemma 2 Assume that 1n3. Let {bi | 1in} be any n-sets of black nodes of Qn and {wi |
1in} be any n-sets of white nodes of Qn such that (bi;wi) is an edge of Qn. Then there exist n
hamiltonian paths P1,..., Pn of Qn such that (1) Pi joins from bi to wi for 1in and (2) Pi(k) <>
Pj(k) for 1k2n and 1i < jn.
Proof: It is obvious that the theorem holds for n = 1. Assume that n = 2. Without loss of
generality, we may assume that (b1;w1) = (10; 00) and (b2;w2) = (01; 11). Then <10; 11; 01; 00>
and <01; 00; 10; 11> are the desired paths. Assume that n = 3. Let tj = | {(bi;wi) | (bi;wi) is a
j-dimensional edge with 1i3}|. Without loss of generality, we assume that t1t2t3.
Suppose that t3 = 0. Let rj = | {bi | bi in Qj3, 1i3 }| for j = 0; 1. Without loss of generality, we
assume that r0r1. Obviously, r0 + r1 = 3. Since there are only four nodes in Q2, we may assume
that {(bi;wi) | 1i2 } in Q03 and (b3;w3) in Q13 . Since the theorem holds for n = 2, there exist
two hamiltonian paths P1 and P2 of Q30 such that (1) Pi joins from bi to wi for 1i2 and (2)
P1(k)P2(k) for 1k4. By Lemma 1, there exists a hamiltonian path P3 of Q13 from b3 to w3.
Obviously, { ePi | 1i3} forms the desired paths.
Now, we assume that t3 <> 0. Obviously, t1 = t2 = t3 = 1. By the symmetric property of Q3, we

Case 2: u ∈ Q04 and v ∈ Q14 . Then u ∈ {1110; 0010; 0100}.
Suppose that u ∈ {1110; 0010}. Set r = 0100. Again, we set P = <u; 1010; 0010; 0110; r> if u =
1110 and P = <u; 1010; 1110; 0110; r> if u = 0010. By Lemma 1, there exists a hamiltonian path
R of Q1n between r4 and v. Obviously, <u; P; r; r4;R; v> forms a hamiltonian path of Q4–{x1; x2;
x3}.
Suppose that u = 0100. We set r = 0010 and P = <u; 0110; 1110; 1010; r>. By Lemma 1, there
exists a hamiltonian path S of Q1n between r4 and v. Obviously, <u; P; r; r4; S; v> forms a
hamiltonian path of Q4–{x1; x2; x3}.
Case 3: u; v ∈ Q14 . The corresponding hamiltonian paths of Q4 - P3 between u and v are:
0001; 1001; 1101; 0101; 0100; 0110; 1110; 1010; 0010; 0011; 0111; 1111; 1011
0001; 1001; 1101; 0101; 0100; 0110; 1110; 1010; 0010; 0011; 1011; 1111; 0111
0001; 1001; 1011; 0011; 0111; 0101; 0100; 0110; 0010; 1010; 1110; 1111; 1101
1011; 0011; 0010; 1010; 1110; 0110; 0100; 0101; 0001; 1001; 1101; 1111; 0111
1011; 1111; 1110; 1010; 0010; 0110; 0100; 0101; 0111; 0011; 0001; 1001; 1101
0111; 0011; 0010; 1010; 1110; 0110; 0100; 0101; 0001; 1001; 1011; 1111; 1101
The lemma is proved.
Lemma 8 Qn –{x; y} is hamiltonian laceable if x and y are any two nodes from different partite
sets of Qn with n >=4.
Theorem 1 IHC(Qn) = n - 1 if n ∈ {1; 2; 3} and IHC(Qn) = n if n > 3.
Lemma 10 Suppose that P3 = <x1; x2; x3> is a path of Qn joining two white nodes x1 and x3. There
exists a hamiltonian path of Qn–{x1; x2; x3} between any two black nodes u and v for n > 3.
Lemma 11 Assume that n is even and n >3. There exists a hamiltonian path P1; P2,..., Pn of Qn
such that (1) Pi joins from e to (~e)i and (2) Pi(k) <> Pj(k) for 1 <= i < j <= n and 2 <= k <= 2n.
Theorem 2 IHPL(Qn) = 1 if n ∈ {1; 2; 3}, and IHPL(Qn) = n - 1 if n >3.
Proof: By Lemma 4, IHPL(Qn) = 1 if n ∈ {1; 2; 3}. Now, we want to prove IHPL(Qn) = n-1 if n
>= 4 by induction. We need to construct (n-1)-mutually independent hamiltonian paths of Qn
from any white node u to any black node v. Without loss of generality, we can assume that u = e.
Suppose that n = 4. Then the Hamming weight of v, w(v), is either 1 or 3. Thus, we can assume
that v = 1000 or 1110. The corresponding mutually independent hamiltonian paths from u to v in
Q4 are:
0000,0010,0110,0100,1100,1110,1010,1011,0011,0001,0101,0111,1111,1101,1001,1000
