The present study presents the effect of deformation and stress due to 
preloading on vibration of circular plates. The preloadings may be applied in 
the radial direction on edge or in the transverse direction on plate surface. The 
research features that, first, a unified displacement field for circular plates is 
employed; secondly, the formulation is based on elasticity and has less 
approximations or assumptions than plate theories; third and the most 
noticeable, the analysis takes into account the deformation due to preloading, 
in addition to the stresses and shows that such deformation has significant 
effect on vibration of circular plates for some cases.

[11]. The variational statement for circular plates under surface loadings is given as: 
{ } { } { } { }∫∫ ∫ −= A Tt vol T dtdAUPdvST }{0 δδ                       (2) 
where the stress, strain, and displacement vectors are 
{ } [ ]rzzrzzrTT τττσσσ θθ=  
{ } [ ]rzzrzzrTS γγγεεε θθ=  
{ } [ ]wvuU T =  
{P} is the initial loadings on surfaces of the plate. 
   After substituting strain-displacement and stress-strain equations into eq. (2) and follow 
the standard procedure of finite element method, we can derive the system equation: 
[ ]{ } { }FXK =                                             (3) 
Solving the above equation can obtain the nodal displacements, {X}, then strains can be 
calculated from displacements through differentiation, and then stresses, with the 
constitutive equation. These are the initial stresses distributed throughout the whole plate 
induced by the initial loadings. The initial stresses are denoted as 
{ } [ ]******* rzzrzzrTT τττσσσ θθ= . 
   Influence of initial stresses on free vibration of plates are through the products of initial 
stresses and their corresponding nonlinear strains [1] and contribute to the stiffness of the 
plate in the following way:

   Finite element procedure will lead to the elemental equation as  
[ ] [ ][ ]{ } [ ]{ } { }0=++ xmxgk &&                                 (5) 
where [g] is the matrix derived from terms involving initial stresses in eq. (4) and is often 
called geometric stiffness matrix. {x} is vector of nodal displacements. For details of these 
matrices, see Appendix I. 
   Assemblage of all the elemental equations ends up with the system equation and the 
corresponding eigenvalue problem 
[ ] [ ][ ]{ } [ ]{ } { }0=++ XMXGK &&       [ ] [ ][ ]{ } [ ]{ }XMXGK 2ω=+              (6) 
whereω is the natural frequency and this is the equation that we use to solve vibration of 
circular plates with initial loadings. 
   Till this step, the role that the deformation due to preloading plays is still not clear and 
 6 
frequencies, respectively, of clamped circular plates under uniform lateral loadings. 
Nondimensional frequencies of a/h=10 (20x2), 20 (40x2), 50 (50x1), and 100 (100x1) are 
reported at hwc / =0.1~0.5 with an increment of 0.1. The nondimensionalization is the 
same as in table 1. cw  is the center displacement and also the maximum deflection when 
the plate is preloaded. Choosing cw as a base for comparison can highlight the effect of 
deformation for stressed vibration of plates. Loadings are thus adjusted to obtain the 
desired center deflections. From tables 3 and 4, it is observed that additionally including 
deformation in analyses leads to higher frequencies than considering initial stresses alone 
for all the cases shown, just the same as in tables 1 and 2. Table 3 shows that frequencies 
between Models A and B change obviously and violently when loading increases. Even for 
the maximum deflection just one tenth of the plate thickness, the discrepancy in 
nondimensional axisymmetric fundamental frequency can increase by about 6 percent for 
all the four values of a/h. When the loading increases and the center deflection reaches half 
of the plate thickness, considering both stresses and deformation (Model B) than only 
stresses (Model A) increases the nondimensional frequency by 138, 144, 145, and 146 
percent for a/h=10, 20, 50, and 100, respectively. The results also show that even for a thin 
plate with a/h=100, which can easily deform under loading to a deflection of its thickness, a 
half thickness center displacement of a clamped circular plate can have a frequency (ω) 50 
more percent higher than when the plate is flat without prestressing. When the initial 
stresses are considered alone, frequencies get just a little smaller with the increase of center 
deflection or loading, unlike the fast decrease in tables 1 and 2. If the deformed 
configuration alone is considered without involving initial stresses in the plate, Model C, 
nondimensional frequencies are also higher than Model A, but with a difference of about 
one fifth to one sixth of that of Models A and B. The higher frequencies of Model B from 
those of Models A or C, or the non-stressed vibration, can be due to the effect of a 
complicated effect of displacements, derivatives of displacements, and stresses when the 
plate is preloaded and can not be derived by considering only the initial stresses or 
deformation alone. For the non-axisymmetric fundamental frequency of n=1, all the 
conclusions obtained for table 3 can be applied as well with the differences between 
Models A and B and between Models A and C being smaller, but still significant. These are 
interesting and useful results and have not been reported in the literature, to the knowledge 
of the authors, and should be kept in mind when dealing with vibration problem of plate 
with initial loading.  
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
In the present research, a unified displacement field is employed and a finite element 
formulation is developed through three-dimensional elasticity to analyze vibration of 
circular plates with radial or transverse initial loadings. Theoretically, the present approach 
should be superior to those based on plate theories, due to less assumptions and 
approximations used. To find the individual effect of stress and deformation due to 
preloading on vibration frequency of circular plates, three models are set up in the study – 
Model A considers initial stresses only, like most reported in the literature; Model B 
includes both stresses and deformation induced by initial loading; and Model C uses only 
deformation by initial loading. Circular plates with radial compressive force on the outer 
edge are analyzed first and compared to those in the literature. The present method and a 
first-order shear-deformation plate theory agree quite well for circular plates and for 
lower-loading annular plates. For vibration of circular plates with initial transverse loadings, 
frequency only has minor change along with the increase of loading unlike that of radial 
loading shown in tables 1 and 2, when initial stresses alone are considered (Model A).
