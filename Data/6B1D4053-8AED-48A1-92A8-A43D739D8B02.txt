Abstract: The purpose of this study was to develop a novel measurement method using a 
machine vision system. Besides using image processing techniques, the proposed system 
employs a detection line algorithm that detects the tool electrode length and drilling depth 
of a workpiece accurately and effectively. Different boundaries of areas on the tool 
electrode are defined: a baseline between base and normal areas, a ND-line between 
normal and drilling areas (accumulating carbon area), and a DD-line between drilling area 
and dielectric fluid droplet on the electrode tip. Accordingly, image processing techniques 
are employed to extract a tool electrode image, and the centroid, eigenvector, and 
principle axis of the tool electrode are determined. The developed detection line algorithm 
(DLA) is then used to detect the baseline, ND-line, and DD-line along the direction of the 
principle axis. Finally, the tool electrode length and drilling depth of the workpiece are 
estimated via detected baseline, ND-line, and DD-line. Experimental results show good 
accuracy and efficiency in estimation of the tool electrode length and drilling depth under 
different conditions. Hence, this research may provide a reference for industrial 
application in EDM drilling measurement.

2.1 Image Acquisition System and EDM Drilling Machine 
 
As shown in Figure 1, an EDM machine (JM-430, Jiten) and a controller (P-30, Jiten) were 
employed to drill workpieces to certain depths. In order to obtain tool electrode images on-line, a 
machine vision system is proposed. Images were acquired using a CCD (coupled-charge device) 
monochrome camera (WAT-902B, Watec) with a zoom lens (Zoom 6000 combinations, Navitar), a 
frame grabber (Meteor, Matrox Inc), and a personal computer (Intel Pentium 4 processor 2.4 GHz). 
Matrox Imaging Library (MIL 8.0, Matrox Inc) was linked to the programs to grab monochrome 
images of 640×480 pixels in size. The CCD camera was employed for image acquisition with forward 
lighting. Images were stored in the hard drive of the personal computer in tagged image file format 
(TIF). Image processing was performed using Visual C++ 6.0 programming.

2.2 Electrode Length and Drilling Depth Detection 
 
2.2.1 Electrode Image Extraction 
 
Segmenting the tool electrode image is an essential procedure once the characteristics of the 
electrode have been extracted. The electrode image is extracted using thresholding, hole-filling, 
closing, and opening operators, as illustrated in Figure 2. Firstly, the principle axis of the tool electrode 
needs to be identified. By assuming the binary image of electrode is ),( ii yxf  (where i=1, 2,…N, and 
the total number of pixels is N), the centroid is obtained as ∑=

M 1  is the mean vector. T indicates vector transposition. A pair of orthogonal eigenvectors of 
the covariance matrix is calculated. The geometric features – the centroid and the principle axis of 
electrode, are then computed using eigenvectors, as shown in Figure 3.

However, the distribution of gray levels method is not applicable in determining the position of the 
baseline because variations in gray levels along a detection line from normal to base areas are 
unobvious. For this reason, the baseline is determined using a detection line according to an obvious 
variation of the diameter from the normal area to the base area. Therefore, a novel method － the 
detection line algorithm (DLA) is proposed to find the positions of the ND-line, DD-line, and baseline. 
These boundary lines are then used to segment the base, normal, drilling areas, and dielectric fluid 
droplet on the tool electrode according to the above-mentioned contentions in this study. Thus, this 
method can be employed to estimate the tool electrode length with the dielectric fluid droplet remains 
on its tip effectively.

depth in a workpiece accurately and rapidly. 
The distributions of gray levels from the centroid to the tip of the tool electrode using a detection

Figure 12. Although the gray levels of the drilling area scatter in distance-gray level space, the 
distribution of gray levels appears as a single peak curve. For the dielectric fluid droplet, the fitted 
curve is a dual peak. The shapes and maximum values of fitted curves are contributed to detections of 
the ND-line and DD-line positions.  
Finally, for the detection of the baseline, the diameter function of electrode )( pd  and its first-order 
derivative )( pd ′  are obtained using DAL, as showed in Figure 13. Hence, the position of baseline is 
determined accurately.

Experimental conditions are shown in Table 1. Copper is used as the tool electrode anode, and the 
diameters of electrode are 1.5 mm (20 samples), 2.0 mm (20 samples), 2.5 mm (20 samples), and 3.0 
mm (20 samples) respectively. A series of experiments with different machining parameters are 
performed and EDW is employed to estimate the tool electrode lengths and drilling depths. The 
workpieces are then cut open by WEDM (wire electrical discharge machine) manually for actual 
drilling depths measurement. The estimated values of electrode length and drilling depth are obtained 
using our machine vision system, and manually measured values are obtained by a tool-maker 
microscope. Figure 14 shows the machined holes, electrodes and cut section of the workpiece. 
Experimental results are given in Table 2. The drilling speed is increased with the peak current, but the 
electrode wear (i.e., the difference in electrode length before and after the drilling) is augmented 
simultaneously. For example, the average machined time is 28 minutes (electrode wear 0.062 mm) in a 
peak current of 6.0 A, but slowed down to 42 minutes (electrode wear 0.033 mm) in a peak current of 
5.0 A with the same drilling depth (2.0 mm). The average error between estimated and manually 
measured electrode lengths is 0.075 mm, and for drilling depths is 0.245 mm. The accuracy of 
estimated drilling depth is reduced because the accumulating carbon on the electrode surface grown at 
the drilling area, and the size and shape of dielectric fluid droplet is uncertain. For this reason, the 
boundary between the normal and drilling areas is an irregular border. Moreover, another possible 
cause is the gap distance in EDM drilling. In general, the gap distance is an uncertain variable. 
However, under certain circumstances, the gap distance is more precise, and hence, overall accuracy 
can be increased. For example, a steady gap status is achieved when using the servo feed control in

Bleys et al. [7, 8 ] presented real-time tool wear sensing
and compensation in layer-by-layer EDM milling based on
discharge pulse evaluation in order to estimate electrode
wear online using a mathematical model of the sparking
frequency. Jeong and Min [9] proposed a geometric
simulation model of the micro-EDM-drilling process with
a cylindrical tool to predict the geometries of the tool and
drilled hole. An offline tool wear compensation scheme
based on the developed model was also proposed to
fabricate blind holes. Kozak et al. [10] presented two
models of electrode shape deformation which take into
consideration the effect of tool electrode wear. This study
showed a good agreement of theoretical and experimental
results of modeling of the rotary electrical discharge
machining process. Sato et al. [11] proposed a new grooving
method based on a two-dimension steady-electrode wear
model to machine shallow grooves. Experiments have
shown that spinning columnar electrodes contributed to
triangular grooves as the steady-electrode wear model
predicted. Pham et al. [12] proposed a simple method for
volumetric wear ratio estimation in micro-EDM drilling based
on geometrical information obtained from the machining
process. Chang et al. [13] presented a robust gap width
controller to remove the influence of longitudinal tool wear
for electric discharge-scanning process. Li et al. [14]
proposed a servo-scanning EDM method in which electrode
wear was compensated on real time by servo control of dis-
charge gap. A method of workpiece vibration-assisted servo-
scanning 3D micro-EDM was also developed to improve the
machining process [15]. Ozgedik el al. [16] investigated the
variations of edge and front wear characteristics as well as
machining performance outputs like workpiece removal rate,
tool wear rate, relative wear, and workpiece surface rough-
ness for various machining conditions in EDM.
Rapid developments in the image-processing technique
and machine vision systems have enabled direct electrode
wear measurement to be accomplished in the field of EDM.
Kaneko et al. [17] presented an optical measurement of the
electrode deformation by using a charge-coupled device
(CCD) sensor which reduced the time interval of the
machining interruption from a few minutes to several
seconds without deteriorating the accuracy of the measure-
ment. Guo et al. [18] developed an online electrode
measurement module based on a CCD vision system to
fabricate microelectrodes. The size of the electrode diam-
eter with a relative measurement error of 3% was achieved
by the machine vision system when compared with the
measured result using a scanning electro microscope.
Although many electrode wear-sensing and compensa-
tion methods have been proposed, there still have some key
issues in handling the tool electrode wear of micro-EDM.
First, complicated 3D microcavities were successfully
machined by using the uniform wear method; productivity
was, however, much lower since the machining depth of
each layer was a very small layer thickness (0.5–10 μm).
Second, the overlapping of tool paths for layer-by-layer
machining was effective in improving the precision of the
machined surface as well as making electrode wear more
uniform. Nevertheless, the overlap between the two
adjoining paths was usually determined empirically. Third,
existing electrode wear compensation methods based on
offline tool wear prediction [2–4, 9] and real-time tool
wear-sensing approach [7, 8] are all indirect methods for
the continuous measurement of tool dimensions. This paper
presents an electrode wear compensation method in micro-
EDM using an optical measurement of the tool electrode.
Front wear and corner wear of the tool electrode can be
measured and evaluated in a direct manner based on a
machine vision system. By means of the developed machine
vision system, the relationship between the machining depth

indicates vector transposition. Then, a pair of orthogonal
eigenvectors of the covariance matrix is calculated. The
geometric features—the centroid and the principle axis of the
electrode—are computed using eigenvectors, as shown in
Fig. 4. A scanning line is used to find the coordinate of the
electrode tip along the direction of the principle axis from
the centroid on the electrode section, as shown in Fig. 4.
Figure 5 depicts the steps of image processing for
recognizing the microelectrode tip. First, an image is
acquired in digital form, and an electrode image can be
extracted using standard operations. Then, the centroid and
the principal axis are computed and identified, respectively.
By using the centroid and principal axis, the scanning line
can be determined. Finally, the microelectrode tip image can
be obtained by means of the scanning line.
Figure 6 shows electrode images in EDM drilling and
milling. As shown in Fig. 6a, front wears are increased
rapidly during EDM drilling and thus contributing to an arc
shape at the end of tool electrode. Figure 6b shows both
front wear and corner wear results in a tapering shape at the
end of tool electrode during EDM milling. An increase in
machining depth results in an increase in discharge area on
the side of the tool electrode, and thus the tool electrode
becomes sharper. Figure 7 depicts the measurement of the
front wear. By means of the developed micro-EDM
machine, top positions of electrode before machining Z1,
after machining Z2, and filed of electrode image Z0 can be
recorded. The length of the electrode image before
machining P1 and after machining P2 can be computed
using the image-processing software. Accordingly, elec-
trode lengths before machining L1 and after machining L2
can be computed by L1 ¼ Z0Z1 þ P1 and L2 ¼ Z0Z2 þ P2,

program paths. The third type is electrode wear compensa-
tion of each machining layer for overlapping program
paths. The fourth type is electrode wear compensation of
each machining layer for finish machining operations.
Taking machining a quadratic cavity with a length of
1 mm and a depth of 150 μm at a feed rate of 0.5 mm/min
as an example, tool paths were designed using CAD as
depicted in Fig. 13. Tool path 1 is a z-axis displacement of
45 μm. For path 1, an electrode wear compensation value
of 30 μm is derived from Fig. 11 for a hole of 45 μm and a
feed rate of 0.5 mm/min. Path 2 (a linear command of
1 mm) is not overlapped with other tool paths, and thus a
front wear ratio of 0.15 is derived from Fig. 12 for a groove
with a depth of 45 μm. As a result, an electrode wear
compensation value of 150 μm can be computed for a
1-mm length of the groove. Accordingly, an electrode wear
compensation value of 15 μm can be computed for linear
path 3 with a linear command of 0.1 mm. Path 4 (a linear
command of 1 mm) is overlapped with other tool paths, and
track overlapping was designed as one third of the electrode
diameter. Therefore, the electrode wear compensation value
for the overlapping path 4 is one third of the compensated
value of no overlapping path as much as 50 μm. Front wear
compensation values are also calculated in the same manner
for the other tool paths (paths 5–22).
5 Experimental results and discussion
To testify the usefulness of the proposed electrode wear
compensation method, some microgrooves (machining
depth 100 μm), microsquare cavities (side length 1 mm),
and microtriangle cavities (side length 1 mm) have been
machined. Figure 14 shows a comparison between a linear
groove with a length of 2 mm and a depth of 100 μm
machined with no electrode wear compensation and with
the proposed compensation method. As shown in Fig. 14a,
longitudinal electrode wear was not compensated in the z-axis
direction and thereby resulting in an inclination of the
machined groove. As depicted in Fig. 14b, a uniform groove
with a deviation of 4 μm can be achieved when using the
proposed electrode wear compensation method. In order to
machine a quadratic cavity with a length of 1 mm and a
depth of 150 μm, tool paths were designed using CAD as
depicted in Fig. 15. Figure 15a,b shows the tool paths for
odd layers and even layers, respectively, during layer-by-
layer machining. To improve the machining accuracy of
machined surfaces, overlapping of program paths were
designed for each layer. Figure 16 shows an electrode image

between the uniform wear method and the proposed
electrode wear compensation method. In the case of the
uniform wear method, the depth of the cut for each sliced
layer was calculated from the electrode volume wear ratio,
cross-section area of the electrode, area of the machined
layer, and machined length proposed by Yu et al. [2]. The
machining depth of each layer was as small as 0.5–10 μm
to reduce the corner wear of the tool electrode as well as
maintain the original shape at the bottom of the tool
electrode. The overlap between the two adjoining paths was
usually determined empirically. Whereas in the proposed
method, front wear can be compensated using the front
wear curves as shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Corner wear also
can be calculated and monitored by means of the
developed machine vision system. The overlap of paths
can be determined appropriately by electrode images
acquired after one-layer machining. Therefore, the latter
enables a thicker machining layer for rough machining
operations and shorter program path for layer-by-layer
finish machining operations and thereby achieving less
machining time.
