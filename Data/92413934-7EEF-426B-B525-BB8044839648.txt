中文： 
本研究以射頻磁控濺鍍法製備不同 N2 流量比例之鋁鉻鉭鈦鋯
五元高熵合金及其氮化物薄膜。隨著 N2 流量比例增加，此氮化物
薄膜最大硬度達 29.5 GPa，潛變應變速率則隨著 N2 流量比例增加
而上升。N2 流量增加則有助於提升薄膜與 Si 基板間之界面附著
強度，可由 7.5 J/m2 提升至 21.2 J/m2。此外，高熵合金薄膜透過
剪變帶的生成及擴張而變形，N2 流量增加則變形時將形成裂縫。
技術說明 英文： 
An AlCrTaTiZr five-element high-entropy alloy (HEA) and its 
nitride (HEAN) films were deposited by reactive radio-frequency 
magnetron sputtering in an Ar+N2 atmosphere. With increasing N2 flow 
ratio, the HEAN films presented the maximum mechanical properties 
(hardness 29.5 GPa) but a higher creep strain rate. With increasing N2 
flow ratio, the interface adhesion strength increased from 7.5 to 21 J/m2
due to a stronger interface bonding. The HEA films deformed through 
the initiation and propagation of shear bands; while with increasing N2 
flow ratio, cracks formed in the HEAN films during deformation.

21995 年由葉均蔚教授等人提出一套新穎的合金設計概念，基本定義是在合金系統中，個
別元素之原子比例以不超過 35 % 為原則，所使用的合金系統以五元以上為主，並命名為高
熵合金（High-Entropy Alloy，簡稱 HEA）。高熵合金具有以下特性:(1) 易產生非晶質相與奈
米析出物；(2) 良好的熱穩定性；(3) 極高的硬度，以及 (4) 優越的耐腐蝕性等。可見高熵合
金具有極大的材料應用潛力，若將其作為硬質薄膜方面的應用，相信亦是非常值得探討的。
因此本研究便以射頻磁控濺鍍法製備 AlCrTaTiZr 五元高熵合金氮化物硬質薄膜，並針對其
機械特性以及界面附著力進行分析，期望能得到機械特性優越之硬質薄膜。 
 
二、研究方法 
本實驗以反應式射頻磁控濺鍍機在 P-type (100) 矽基板上製備厚度約為 600 nm 之 
AlCrTaTiZr 高熵合金及其不同氮含量之氮化物薄膜。選用的靶材是以等莫耳比例配置之 
AlCrTaTiZr 之高熵合金靶，濺鍍功率 150 W，基板偏壓 - 100 V，工作壓力維持在 6 mTorr 左
右，通入總氣體流量 (氮氣加氬氣) 30 sccm，其中氮氣流量比例 (RN) 為 0-50%。利用奈米
壓痕儀 (TriboLab, Hysitron, USA and UMIS Base Mode; CSIRO, Australia) 以 Berkovich 鑽石
壓頭 (150 nm) 對薄膜進行機械性質分析，薄膜基本機械性質與潛變分析最大荷重分別為 
500 與 1000 µN，荷重施加及釋放速率相同，分別為 50 與 100 µN/sec，潛變持載 600 sec，
所得之曲線配合 Oliver-Pharr 關係式 [10-12] ，由下列方程式計算後可得到薄膜的硬度 H 與
彈性模數 Ef 。

最後以掃描式電子顯微鏡 (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) 觀察薄不同氮含量之高商合金薄膜表面
破壞情形與界面剝離行為。 
4若氮流率繼續增加，將會形成過當量 (overstoiciometric) 高熵合金氮化物，這些氮原子將填
充 FCC 的四面體格隙位置，如同低溫電漿沉積效果，使薄膜生成處於元素比例呈非平衡狀
態，此將會嚴重影響 HEAN 的結晶結構的穩定性，並存在大量的缺陷。

6用會繼續使加載階段生成之剪變帶擴展至其在此應力可擴展之極限，有較高之潛變速率 (暫
態潛變)，而後 HEA 的變形同樣原子擴散的方式進行穩定變形量的擴散潛變 (穩態潛變)。 
HEAN 同樣於持載開始至約 2 秒的第一階段期間，有相當高變形速率，此與一般拉伸
測試潛變曲線類似，此開始階段 (暫態潛變)，造成高應變速率與快速下降的應變速率的原因
可能是因結構的改變及大量差排的形所造成 [19]，差排密度隨著應變增加，而差排次晶粒的
晶胞結構大小隨之減少，因而降低應變速率。當測試時間繼續增加，進入差排的第二階段 (穩
態潛變)，由於差排密度的上升會因差排回復效應而平衡，因此此階段的變形由薄膜中原子的
擴散來進行。至於未飽和之高低合金氮化物因為奈米晶粒散佈於非晶基地，因此此變形行為
兼具上述兩種方式。HEAN 藉由差排的滑移進行潛變，相較於非晶之 HEA 有較高潛變速
率。由圖 6 不同氮氣流量比例之高熵合金氮化物薄膜潛變應變速率曲線圖，也可以看到隨著
氮氣流量比例增加，潛變應變速率也隨之上升，由 1.6×10-4 1/s 升至 7.3×10-4 1/s ，這也證明
了具結晶性的高熵合金氮化物，有較高之潛變能力。

3.4 高熵合金氮化物薄膜界面附著強度分析 
本實驗採用奈米刮痕測試法量測不同氮氣流量比例下高熵合金氮化物薄膜與 Si 基板間
之界面附著強度。刮痕測試要造成界面剝離才能藉由臨界荷重與臨界刮痕寬度計算得界面附
著強度，而膜層剝離條件則是提供薄膜系統界面處足夠的應變能，界面處的剪作用力達到臨
界點，使基板界面間累積的應變能增加至界面間的鍵結強度不堪負荷，系統便會藉由膜層剝
離來釋放過高的能量。由圖 5 RN=0、10、30%的高熵合金氮化物薄膜在奈米刮痕測試下所得
之荷重-位移及深度-位移曲線，分別在刮痕長度為 800、1100、1200 µm 的位置觀察到曲線嚴
重轉折與曲線上下震盪，對照圖 6 RN=0、10、30% 的高熵合金氮化物薄膜刮痕測試造成界面
剝離位置週遭之表面 SEM 影像，也可以明顯看到薄膜已發生剝離，發生剝離的臨界荷重 Pc 
分別為 101、79、91 mN ，由此薄膜剝離時之臨界荷重與刮痕寬度，經計算得到不同氮氣流
量比例下高熵合金氮化物薄膜與 Si 基板間的界面附著強度，如圖 7 所示。圖 7 顯示薄膜

83.5 高熵合金氮化物薄膜變形行為分析 
圖 8 為不同氮氣流量比例之高熵合金氮化物薄膜壓痕周圍 SEM 影像，由圖 8 (a) (b) 
可以觀察到高熵合金薄膜在三角形壓痕周圍有明顯環狀條紋並且有向外擴張的趨勢，此為剪
變帶的生成與傳播，顯示 RN=0% 之高熵合金薄膜變形機制為剪變帶的擴展。當氮氣流量比
例增加後，薄膜的壓痕周圍無剪變帶產生，而於壓痕鄰邊與頂端等應力集中區域可觀察到裂
縫的生成，如圖 8 (c) (d) (e) (f) ，表示高熵合金氮化物薄膜變形行為發生轉變，由高熵合金
之剪變帶變形轉為裂縫成核成長與擴展。比較飽和與未飽和之 HEAN 薄膜間的變形差異，
可以發現到飽和氮化物裂縫的擴展連續性較高且較直，裂縫局部位置是穿晶擴展，顯示薄膜
為硬且脆的材料，而未飽和氮化物薄膜裂縫沿著晶界擴展，連續性較差，裂縫擴展受非晶的
基地阻擋其擴展行為，相較飽和氮化物其有較佳的韌性。

四、結論 
本研究以反應式射頻磁控濺鍍法將 AlCrTaTiZr 五元高熵合金及其濺鍍於矽基板上，利
用奈米壓痕測試與奈米刮痕測試進行奈米機械性質與界面附著強度之量測。隨著氮氣流量的
增加，薄膜之機械性質隨之上升，RN=30 % 薄膜擁有最大硬度達 29.5 GPa，潛變應變速率則
隨之上升。於奈米刮痕測試下也得知隨著氮氣流量的增加也明顯提升了高熵合金氮化物薄膜
對 Si 基板的附著能力，因此界面附著強度由 7.5 提升至 21.2 J/m2。經觀察壓痕周圍變形形
貌得知，RN=0% 高熵合金壓痕周圍具有明顯的剪變帶生成及擴張，氮氣流量增加後，壓痕周
圍卻是裂縫的生成，表示其不同的變形行為。

0.5° X-ray diffractometer XRD, Rigaku Dmax 2000 with a
Cu K radiation was used to analyze the crystal structures of the
ﬁlm and ﬁlm stack. A high-resolution transmission electron micro-
scope HR-TEM, JEOL JEM-3000F was used to examine the ﬁlm
microstructures and lattice structures. The depth proﬁling analyses
of elemental distributions in the ﬁlm stack a Cu thickness of
200 nm were performed by Auger electron spectroscopy AES,
VG Scientiﬁc, Microlab 350. The sheet resistance of the HEAN
ﬁlm and the HEAN/Cu bilayer was measured by a four-point probe
method Keithley 2400 probe station. Moreover to evaluate the
thermal stability of the HEAN ﬁlm in the aspect of mechanical
performance for comparison, the hardness and elastic modulus of
the HEAN ﬁlm with a thickness of about 560 nm were measured
before and after thermal annealing by using a TriboLab nanoin-
denter Hysitron Incorporated with a Berkovich diamond indenter
tip tip radius 50 nm. To avoid any measurement inaccuracies
caused by a substrate effect, the indentation depths were controlled
at about 50 nm.
Results and Discussion
Thermal stability of AlCrTaTiZrHEANﬁlm.— From surface mor-
phologies and cross-sectional microstructures, it was observed that a
continuous and smooth AlCrTaTiZr HEAN ﬁlm with a thickness of
about 40 nm was deposited on Si substrates by a reactive sputtering
process. No special growth morphology was found, and the surface
roughness of the ﬁlm was as small as about 0.24 nm. By EPMAs it
was known that the HEAN ﬁlm contained 48.8 atom % N and could
be regarded as a saturated nitride ﬁlm, AlCrTaTiZrN, and the con-
tent of O was controlled at a very low level of 2.1 atom %. The
contents of metallic elements in the AlCrTaTiZr HEAN ﬁlm ranged
around 8–13 atom % in a near-equimolar ratio. Furthermore from
the HR-TEM lattice image of the HEAN ﬁlm shown in Fig. 1a,
besides an amorphous native oxide layer of about 5 nm existing at
the Si/HEAN interface, nanocrystallites with a short-range ordered
lattice structure in a size of only a few nanometers were identiﬁed in
the HEAN ﬁlm. Under a more detailed lattice examination shown in
Fig. 1b at a high magniﬁcation, the lattice spacings of these nano-
crystallites were characterized as about 0.22 and 0.25 nm, approxi-
mately matching the average values of 111 and 200 lattice planes
of mixed AlCrTaTiZr HEAN, as listed in Table I. The consistency
between the measured and averaged lattice spacings implies the for-
mation of face-centered cubic fcc, solid-solution structure from all
composed nitrides. No obvious grain boundaries in or between the
nanocrystallites were recognized; instead an amorphous matrix
within which atoms were randomly distributed was found to sur-
round the nanocrystallites, indicating the coexistence of both crys-
talline and amorphous structures to construct a nitride nanocompos-
ite ﬁlm.
In the XRD pattern of as-deposited AlCrTaTiZr HEAN ﬁlm
shown in Fig. 2, not many sets of diffraction peaks of individual Al,
Cr, Ta, Ti, and Zr nitrides were observed, but only one set of fcc
structure of mixed AlCrTaTiZr HEAN was identiﬁed instead. The
positions of measured 111 and 200 diffraction peaks were rather
close to the average angles of all constituted nitrides, 36 and 42°,
respectively, as listed in Table I, verifying the formation of mixed
solid solution with a simple fcc crystal structure. However the peaks
were still broad with low intensities, interpreting the partial exis-
tence of amorphous structure around the formed fcc nanocrystallites
in accordance with the aforementioned HR-TEM analyses. The for-
mation of the simple solid solution with either an amorphous or a
crystalline fcc structure consisted with the phenomena observed in
many other reported HEAs, conﬁrming the effect of high mixing
entropy on the random distribution of added components and the
simpliﬁcation of crystal structures.22
The AlCrTaTiZr HEAN ﬁlm exhibited a very high thermal sta-
bility. From the surface morphologies and microstructures of the
HEAN ﬁlm after annealing at high temperatures of even 900°C, a
smooth ﬁlm with a retained thickness of 40 nm and a clear Si/HEAN
interface without appearance of any pores due to the Kirkendall
effect,34 elucidating the interdiffusion of Si and HEAN was still
observed. From the XRD patterns of the HEAN ﬁlm after annealing
at 700–900°C, as shown in Fig. 2, the high thermal stability of the
ﬁlm was also veriﬁed. Compared with the as-deposited state, no
variations in the diffraction patterns were recognized even at 900°C.
Two main peaks at 36 and 42°, still small and broad though, corre-
sponded to the 111 and 200 lattice planes of the fcc structure,
indicating the remainder of the original amorphous and crystalline
nanocomposite structures. Despite the existence of partly crystalline
structure, the HEAN ﬁlm remained thermally stable without any
interdiffusion or reaction to the Si substrate at high temperatures.

nm to several hundreds of nanometers. Agglomeration of the Cu
ﬁlm into discontinuous particles then occurred at 900°C due to the
effect of surface tension at the high temperature.
Figure 6 shows the XRD patterns of the Si/HEAN/Cu ﬁlm stack
before and after thermal annealing. The diffraction peaks at 43.3 and
50.4° corresponded to the 111 and 200 lattice planes of fcc Cu
ﬁlm, both of which remained unchanged after annealing. No signals
of any silicides or other crystalline compound phases were detected
even at the extremely high temperature of 900°C, suggesting the
great stability of the HEAN ﬁlm as an effective diffusion barrier
layer. The only difference from the as-deposited state was the varia-
tion in the peak intensities of Cu. During annealing at 700 and
800°C, the grain growth of the Cu ﬁlm occurred and induced peak
sharpening; then the peak intensity decreased at 900°C due to some
Cu agglomeration, as observed in Fig. 5.
Moreover Fig. 7 plots the AES depth proﬁling analyses of ele-
ment contents in the Si/HEAN/Cu ﬁlm stack before and after ther-
mal annealing. From the element distributions, the minimized inter-
diffusion of Si and Cu through the HEAN barrier layer was realized.
In the as-deposited state, the layered structure of Cu ﬁlm, HEAN
layer, and Si substrate was clearly distinguished. Under annealing
even at 900°C, still very rare Si and Cu elements began to penetrate

fcc crystal structure of mixed HEAN, in accordance with the afore-
mentioned analyses and the values listed in Table I.
According to the above SEM and TEM observations as well as
XRD, AES, and resistance and mechanical analyses, the excellent
diffusion resistance of the AlCrTaTiZr HEAN ﬁlm is realized. Be-
sides the strong ionic bonds and stufﬁng effect of N,28 some other
dominant factors for the HEAN ﬁlm to possess the outstanding ther-
mal stability and to act as a very effective diffusion barrier layer at
the extremely high temperature of even 900°C can be summarized.
First, a high mixing entropy contributed by the random distribution
of added multiprincipal elements stabilizes the presence of simple
solid-solution structure, in the form of either amorphous or crystal-
line fcc structure rather than any compound phases.22 Second, the
existence of severely distorted lattices and high strain ﬁelds caused
by the mixing of multiprincipal elements with different atomic sizes
retards the diffusion of atoms.22 Third, a high packing density and a
low free volume attributed to the incorporation of different-sized
elements lower the diffusion rate of atoms. Then more importantly
the nanocomposite structure of nanocrystallites surrounded by an
amorphous matrix without the appearance of grain boundaries re-
duces the number of viable diffusion paths and thus provides a great
resistance to the diffusion of atoms.
Conclusions
In summary based on the concept of conﬁguration entropy, a
nitride nanocomposite ﬁlm of HEA with the incorporation of
equimolar multiprincipal elements was developed in this study for
the application to diffusion barriers. An AlCrTaTiZrN ﬁlm with a
N content of 48.8 atom % was deposited by a simple reactive sput-
tering process, and its thermal stability and diffusion resistance to
Cu metallization were characterized under thermal annealing at
700–900°C. It was found from the analyses that the AlCrTaTiZrN
nanocomposite ﬁlm was constructed of fcc nanocrystallites sur-
rounded by an amorphous matrix and remained thermally stable at
the extremely high temperature of even 900°C. Neither interdiffu-
sion between Si and Cu through the AlCrTaTiZrN layer occurred
nor did any silicides or compound phases form around. Large lattice
distortions and the nanocomposite structure without grain bound-
aries were expected as the dominant factors for the AlCrTaTiZrN
ﬁlm being a very effective barrier material to inhibit the diffusion of
Cu metallization.

2I. Introduction 
One-dimensional nanostructures of semiconducting materials have been widely studied 
in the past decade because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and high application 
potentials [1-3]. Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO), a II-VI semiconductor with a hexagonal 
wurtzite structure, has a wide direct bandgap of about 3.37 eV and a high exciton binding 
energy of 60 meV; thus, ZnO nanostructures exhibit a higher photoluminescence efficiency at 
room temperature than other typical materials [4]. Moreover, because of the advantages of 
good chemical and electrical properties and high thermal stability, ZnO nanostructures, in 
particular nanowires and nanorods, have been favorably applied to many fields such as lasers, 
sensors, transistors, displays, solar cells, etc. [1, 4-8]. For the preparation of ZnO nanorod 
arrays, vapor-phase deposition, such as vapor-liquid-solid growth and chemical vapor 
deposition etc., has been widely adopted [9-13]. However, due to the drawbacks of vapor-
phase deposition including complex processes, high synthesis temperatures and expensive 
equipments, growth of ZnO nanorods alternatively in aqueous solutions at low temperatures, 
for instance by a hydrothermal method, is intensively attempted in recent years to replace the 
high-cost vapor-phase deposition processes [14-31].
The size, density and growth orientation of ZnO nanorods determine their potential and 
feasibility in optoelectronic applications; especially, the preparation of well-aligned nanorod 
arrays is strongly demanded. Thus, many studies have focused on the syntheses of aligned 
ZnO nanorod arrays by using cheap and low-temperature aqueous processes including a 
hydrothermal method [14-31]. However, without the application of ordered tubular templates, 
the directions of most ZnO nanorods grown by typical aqueous processes, including the 
common hydrothermal method, are random in general [18-24], rendering the development of 
these processes limited. Afterwards, further researches to improve the growth alignment of 
ZnO nanorod arrays by the application of vapor-phase deposited epitaxial seed layers [25, 26],
textured substrates [27] or oriented underlayers [28], special substrate pretreatments [29] or 
some modification agents (such as PEI and PVA) are attempted [30, 31]; however, most of 
the improvement procedures are more complex or even expensive. Among them, it has been 
reported that the growth orientation of ZnO nanorods is significantly influenced by the 
texture of substrates or seed layers [18-29], and the seed layers with a specific texture 
essentially facilitate the aligned growth of nanorod arrays [21-22, 25-29]. Nevertheless, the 
seed layers obtained by a conventional sol-gel and thermal curing method generally possess 
random grain orientations; while to prepare textured seed layers by more expensive and 
complex vapor-phase processes instead, such as atomic layer deposition, diminishes the 
opportunity of the cheap and low-temperature aqueous processes for nanorod growth. Thus in 
this research, the preparation of aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) transparent conducting films as 
seed layers with a specific crystalline orientation is attempted by a conventional sol-gel and 
thermal curing method, but in particular with the activation of ultraviolet (UV) exposure; 
well-aligned growth of ZnO nanorod arrays is then performed on the UV-exposed seed layers. 
4UV-exposed seed layer was smaller and the particle density was obviously higher than the 
non-UV-exposed one because under the activation of the UV light, a more considerable DEA 
dissociation and ZnO nucleation was expected to occur [34]; accordingly a larger number of 
crystallites were induced. Due to the growth competition of the larger amount of nuclei, the 
grain size of the UV-exposed seed layer was thus smaller, as about a few nanometers, than 
that of the non-UV-exposed one as about 10 nm. The small amount of heat provided by the 
UV exposure was believed not to contribute to the crystallinity of the AZO films since during 
the UV exposure the substrate temperature just increased to about 100qC, which was much 
lower than the dissociation temperature of DEA ligands [35].
Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of UV- and non-UV-exposed AZO seed layers. In the 
patterns, three main diffraction peaks at between 31q and 37q were identified, corresponding 
to the (100), (002) and (101) lattice planes of ZnO crystal, and confirmed the occurrence of 
crystallization in both seed layers. However, the peak intensities, especially of the non-UV-
exposed seed layer, were still low, indicating a poor crystallinity, since a high temperature of 
420qC was required for the complete crystallization of ZnO [35]. Accordingly, the electrical 
resistivity of the AZO transparent conducting films was still high, around the order of :cm. 
For the non-UV-exposed seed layer, the intensities of these three main peaks were about the 
same, revealing a random distribution of crystallites without a preferred orientation in this 
film. Nevertheless, for the UV-exposed one, the intensity of (002) diffraction peak was found 
to rise markedly, suggesting that this film possessed a much more obvious crystallinity with a 
specific [002] preferred orientation. It was reasonably believed that, under the activation of 
the high-energy UV exposure, early dissociation of DEA ligands from ZnO-DEA precursor 
occurred, then inducing rapid and abundant nucleation of ZnO crystallites [34]. Meanwhile, 
the nuclei were expected to grow and arrange in a specific [002] texture because of the 
directional energy flow provided by the UV light perpendicular to the substrate. A thermal 
gradient from film surface to substrate bottom driving the textured growth of the grains was 
believed similar to the directional solidification of liquids into columnar structures under a 
controlled heat flow direction [36]. Moreover, small-angle boundaries existed between the 
textured grains, leading to small residual stresses in the UV-exposed seed layer [37]; whereas 
high-angle boundaries between the randomly oriented crystallites in the non-UV-exposed 
layer induced high residual stresses and thus very probably resulted in film cracking as 
previously seen in Figure 1 (b). 
B. Aligned Growth of ZnO nanorod arrays
Figure 3 shows the SEM images of ZnO nanorod arrays grown on UV- and non-UV-
exposed AZO seed layers. From the top-view morphologies of the nanorod arrays grown on 
the UV-exposed seed layers as shown in Figures 3 (a) and (b), very clearly almost only the 
top flat surfaces of the hexagonal nanorods were observed, indicating the well-aligned growth 
of the nanorod arrays perpendicular to substrates. Also from the cross-sectional image shown 
in Figure 3 (c), most of the nanorods were seen vertically grown from the seed layer along an 
60.28 nm and a (002) plane spacing of 0.26 nm, the same as those of typical ZnO crystal. The 
growth direction of the nanorods was identified as [002] in accordance with aforementioned 
XRD analyses. 
Figures 7 (a) and (b) further show the HR-TEM lattice images around the interfaces 
between ZnO nanorods and UV- and non-UV-exposed AZO seed layers, respectively. In the 
images, first, from the lattice structures of the single-crystalline nanorods, the [002], [100] 
and [101] three main directions in the rods were determined and marked based on the angle 
relations between these lattice indices. Then identically, according to the lattice spacings of 
the grains, the orientations of all grains in the seed layers were also identified and marked. 
Accordingly, the correlations (angle misfits) of the (002), (100) and (101) lattice orientations 
between the nanorods and the grains on the surfaces of the seed layers were examined and 
plotted in Figure 7 (c) (the total number of grains counted in the UV-exposed seed layer was 
64, and that counted in the non-UV-exposed one was 62). From these lattice images and the 
lattice orientation correlations, it was very obviously known that most of the grains in the 
UV-exposed seed layer oriented along an identical direction, close to that of nanorod growth, 
with smaller angle misfits of lattice orientations than 20q between each others. In comparison, 
the angle misfits between the grains in the non-UV-exposed seed layer were much larger, 
indicating a more random distribution of the grain orientations. Figure 7 (d) schematically 
illustrated the growth of ZnO nanorods from the UV- and non-UV-exposed AZO seed layers; 
highly [002] textured grains in the seed layer with the activation of UV exposure dominated 
the well-aligned and vertical growth of the nanorods. 
IV. Conclusions 
In summary, by the assistance of UV exposure, 300qC cured AZO seed layers exhibited 
an obvious crystallinity and a [002] texture because the UV light activated early dissociation 
of DEA ligands in the gel precursor and induced the nucleation and growth of crystallites in a 
specific direction. On the UV-exposed seed layers, well-aligned hydrothermal growth of ZnO 
nanorod arrays with a high rod density and a [002] preferred orientation was obtained. On the 
contrary, nanorod arrays with a low density and a random orientation were grown on the non-
UV-exposed seed layers. By HR-TEM analyses, the nanorods were identified as ZnO single 
crystals of typical hexagonal wurtzite structure with a (002) lattice spacing of 0.26 nm. From 
the correlations of lattice orientations between the nanorods and the grains in the seed layers, 
it was clearly known that most of the grains in the UV-exposed seed layers oriented along an 
identical direction with small angle misfits. Highly [002] textured grains in the seed layers by 
the activation of UV exposure assisted the aligned growth of the nanorods. Attributed to the 
preferred orientation and high rod density, the PL intensity of the aligned nanorod arrays 
grown on the UV-exposed seed layers was stronger than that of the randomly oriented arrays.
