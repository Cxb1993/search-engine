Abstract. 
A six node degenerate element is proposed by using consistent co-rotational finite 
element formulation for the torsional buckling analysis of doubly symmetric thin-walled 
beams with variable open section under different statically equivalent axial load. Only the 
axial displacement and lateral displacement induced by axial rotation are considered for the 
element developed here. The kinematics of the developed degenerate element is governed by 
two sectional nodes and four element nodes. The element deformations, nodal forces and 
tangent stiffness matrices are described in the current element coordinate system, which is 
constructed at the current configuration of the element. In element nodal forces, all coupling 
between twisting and stretching deformations of the element is considered by consistent 
second-order linearization of the large displacement theory. An incremental-iterative method 
based on the Newton-Raphson method combined with constant arc length of incremental 
displacement vector is employed for the solution of nonlinear equilibrium equations. The zero 
value of the tangent stiffness matrix determinant of the structure is used as the criterion of the 
buckling state.  Numerical examples will be studied to verify the accuracy of the present 
degenerate thin-walled element. The effects of different statically equivalent axial load on the 
torsional buckling load will be investigated.

2 Finite element formulation 
2.1. Basic assumptions 
The following assumptions are made in the derivation of behavior of the beam element. 
(1) The beam is doubly symmetric thin-walled I beams with slow varying flange and uniform 
wall thickness. 
(2) The cross section of the beam does not deform in its own plane and strains within this 
cross section can be neglected. 
(3) The deformation displacements of the beam element are small. 
(4) The material is homogeneous, isotropic and linear elastic. 
 
2.2. Coordinate systems 
In this paper, a co-rotational total Lagrangian formulation is adopted.  In order to describe 
the system, we define two sets of right handed rectangular Cartesian coordinate systems: 
(1) A fixed global set of coordinates, GiX )3,2,1( =i  (see Fig. 3); the nodal coordinates, 
nodal displacements and rotations, and the stiffness matrix of the system are defined in this 
coordinates.  The GX1  axis is chosen to be parallel to the beam axis. 
(2) Element coordinates; ix )3,2,1( =i  (see Figs. 3 and 4), a set of element coordinates is 
associated with each element, which is constructed at the current configuration of the beam 
element.  The deformations, internal nodal forces and stiffness matrix of the elements are 
defined in terms of these coordinates.  In the initial undeformed state, the origin of this 
coordinate system is located at node 1, the 1x  axis is chosen to be parallel to the beam 
axis, and the 2x  axis is chosen to pass through nodes 1 and 2 of the element.  The 
method used to determine the current element coordinates in the deformed state will be 
given as follows. 
Let jφ )6,5( =j denote the rotations of sectional nodes j about the centroid axis of the 
beam.  The rigid body rotation Rφ  of the beam element corresponding to jφ  may be 
defined by 
2
65 φφφ +=R   (1) 
The element coordinates may be brought from its initial position into its current position as 
shown in Fig. 4 by a rotation of the initial element coordinates through an angle Rφ  about 
the centroid axis. 
The element deformation rotations of the sectional node j )6,5( =j referred to the current 
element coordinates may be defined by 
Rjj φφθ −=  (2) 
2.3. Kinematics of the element 
The deformations of the element are described in the current element coordinate system.  
Only the axial displacement and axial rotation are considered here.  The deformations of the 
element may be determined by the displacement along the beam axis and lateral 
displacements induced by the axial rotation about the beam axis.  Let Q (Figs. 3 and 4) be an

generalized moments corresponding to sju,δ , respectively, and jm  and jb )6,5( =j are 
torsional moment and bimoment corresponding to jδθ  and xj,δθ , respectively. 
The element nodal force vector is obtained from the virtual work principle in the current 
element coordinates.  The virtual work principle requires that 
∫= V TT dVσεfq δδ  (31) 
where V is the volume of the undeformed element, εδ   is defined  in Eqn (29) .  
{ }131211  ,    , σσσ=σ , j1σ  )3,2,1( =j are the second Piola-Kirchhoff stresses.  For linear 
elastic material, the stress-strain relation may be expressed by

The element tangent stiffness matrix referred to the global coordinate system may be 
obtained by using the standard coordinate transformation. 
2.6. Equilibrium equations 
The nonlinear equilibrium equations may be expressed by 
0PFΨ =−= λ  (42) 
where Ψ  is the unbalanced force between the internal nodal force F  and the external nodal 
force Pλ , where λ  is the loading parameter, and P is a reference loading.  F  is 
assembled from the element nodal force vectors, which are calculated using Eqns (35-37) first 
in the current element coordinates and then transformed from current element coordinate 
system to the global coordinate system before assemblage using standard procedure. 
In this paper, an weighted Euclidean norm of the unbalanced force is employed as the error 
measure for the equilibrium iterations, and is given by 
toleN
≤λ
Ψ
 (43) 
where N is the number of equilibrium equations; tole  is a prescribed value of error tolerance. 
2.7. Criterion of the buckling state 
Let )(λTK  denote the tangent stiffness matrix of the structure corresponding to the 
loading parameter λ .  The criterion of the buckling state used here may be expressed as 
0)(det)( == λλ TD K . (44) 
Here, the buckling loading parameter NBλ  denotes the minimum loading parameter
