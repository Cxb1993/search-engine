Abstract
The control of segregation by accelerated crucible rotation is investigated by the experiment of vertical
Bridgman crystal growth of Ga-doped Ge. It was shown that the concentration distribution under two
different pulling rates. It is clear that ACRT generates the global mixing slightly. On the other hand, angular
vibration technique (AVT) can reverse the radial segregation easily without enhancing the global mixing.
Although both techniques can reduce radial segregation, AVT is more effective for growth control.
1. Introduction
The control of convection and segregation is important in vertical Bridgman (VB) crystal growth crystal
growth. Because of a lack of control over stirring conditions, the use of external forces is often adopted.
Scheel and Schulz-DuBois proposed an accelerated crucible rotation technique (ACRT) to control the melt
mixing [1]. By controlling the acceleration cycle, it is possible to control the melt mixing at either an
enhanced mixing [2-4] or diffusion-limited mode [5]. The effects of ACRT also depend on the ratio of the
melt depth to the size of Ekman cells, on the buoyant convection, and on the vortices that sometimes form
due to the Taylor-Görtler instability near the ampoule wall [6-8] Therefore, ACRT is believed to be useful

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Axial segregation
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the axial dopant concentration profiles in the Ga-doped Ge crystal. In Fig. 3 and 4,
the axial dopant concentration profile in comparison to Scheil [15], Tiller et al. [16], and experimental
curves were illustrated. During directional solidification, solute transport takes place by diffusion and
convection. Resultant axial dopant concentration profiles in the crystal have been calculated for the case of a
purely diffusive (poor mixing) regime by Tiller et al. [16] and for the case of complete mixing (good mixing)
of the melt by Scheil equation [15] with the following conditions:
a. seed-crystal interface is planar and perpendicular to the growth direction;
b. diffusion in the solid is negligible;
c. distribution coefficient k is constant ( k = 0.087 )
For a purely diffusive (poor mixing) regime, Tiller et al. [16] found Eq. (2) for the axial dopant
concentration profile:
Cs,D ( x ) = C0 [ (1 - k) (1–e –k v x / DL ) + k ] (2)
where Cs,D is concentration in the solid, C0 is concentration in the melt at the beginning of the growth, v is
the growth velocity in cm/min, x is solidified length and DL is diffusion coefficient in the melt = 7.5×10
-5
cm2/s (see ref. [17]).
During growth with complete mixing in the melt the axial dopant concentration
profile can be calculated with the Eq (3):
Cs,c ( x ) = k C0 ( 1–f ) k-1 (3)
where f = ratio of the solidified crystal = x/L, x = solidified length and L = the length
of the crystal.
The resulting curve in Fig. 3 and 4 show the effects of AVT and ACRT in axial direction. In Fig. 3, the
curves of 0Hz and 5Hz are almost no different in axial direction; it indicates that 5Hz AVT only causes the
local mixing in the melt. In addition, after growing ~ 30 % long, the curve of 10Hz AVT closes to the good
mixing curve. Because of the height of melt becomes short during growth process, the amplitude of 10Hz
