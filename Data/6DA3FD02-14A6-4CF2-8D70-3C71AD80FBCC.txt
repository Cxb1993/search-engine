 2 
4G wireless mobile communication systems. 
However, when multiple users simultaneously access 
the system the code orthogonality among users in 
MC-CDMA systems is highly distorted by the 
instantaneous frequency response of the channel. 
Moreover, the Doppler effects due to the mobile moving 
depict a fast fading channel. Thus, the orthogonality of 
2-D codes spreading in the time-domain may be 
degraded due to the Doppler shift of the moving mobile 
station. Therefore, the multiple access interference (MAI) 
due to the frequency selectivity in fading channels or the 
time selectivity in Doppler shift channels degrades the 
performance of 2-D spreading OFCDM communication 
systems. Then, the bit error rate (BER) is degraded due 
to the MAI in multi-user access systems. The MAI due 
to the out-orthogonality among the multiple access 
increases with the active number of users. Therefore, the 
performance of the OFCDM system can be improved by 
adequately selecting the 2-D spreading codes to 
compromise the diversity gain maximization and the 
MAIs minimization. 
The fuzzy logic developed by Zadeh [11] has drawn 
a great deal of attention because of its universal 
approximation ability in the nonlinear problem. The 
adaptive fuzzy controller can adapt time-varying 
uncertainties [12]. Thus, the fuzzy inference systems 
(FIS) have been applied to a variety of fields, such as 
rotor systems [13], face detection and recognition [14], 
ocean salinity and temperature variations prediction [15], 
and so on. Moreover, in previous works, the FIS was 
used to effectively improve the performance of partial 
parallel interference cancellation in DS-CDMA systems 
[16] and MC-CDMA systems [17], respectively. 
Therefore, in this report, we propose an adaptive FIS to 
infer adequate orthogonal variable spreading factor 
(OVSF) codes to compromise the diversity effects and 
MAIs, and thus to improve the downlink system capacity 
for the 2-D spreading OFCDM communication systems. 
The works in this projects have been presented in in ILT 
2007, IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Communication 
and IEEE international conference of SMC 2008, 
respectively [18-20]. 
The rest of this report is organized as follows. In 
Section II, the system model of 2D spreading 
VSF-OFCDM and the channel models are described. 
Section III describes the fuzzy code allocation and 
multiuser detectors. Simulation results of the 
performance of multiuser detection are presented in 
Section IV. Finally, conclusions are given in Section V. 
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
  The description of OFCDM system in this report 
here focuses on the downlink system. A synchronous 
downlink system is performed for simplicity of the 
single cell system model. With the 2-D spreading codes 
from OVSF codes as shown in Fig. 1 [6], we have the 
time-spreading coefficients and the frequency-domain 
spreading coefficients by SFT and SFF, respectively. 
Then the 2-D spreading factor is obtained by 
SF=SFT×SFF. Moreover, in the OVSF codes, the codes 
of l-th level is expressed by 
vl
C
,2 , v = 1,2,…, 2
l
, where 
SF=2l. Then, in this report the 2-D spreading codes 
expressed by },{

transmission of OFCDM wireless communication 
systems, in which the transmitter and receiver models 
are depicted in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) respectively. In 
OFCDM, the N-bit binary data stream of the k-th user is 
modulated with BPSK, 1,...,2,1,0,

 The broadband signal transmitted to the frequency

where Ak,m,i and )(nnm  are the received signal

respectively. 
In OFCDM systems, the orthogonal VSF code is 
performed to spread the transmitted symbol on both the 
time and the frequency domains simultaneously, as 
shown in Fig. 3.  In Fig. 3, the spreading factor is set 16 
and when SFT*SFF=16*1, it means the spreading factor 
is all on time with 16. Then it is called MC-DS-CDMA 
scheme. However, when SFT*SFF=1*16, where the 
spreading is all on frequency with 16. Thus, it is called 
MC-CDMA scheme. 
To obtain the advantage of diversity gain, the maximal 
ratio combining (MRC) techniques [10] is performed in 
this report. Thus, the receiver model for OFCDM 
systems is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). Therefore, the decision 
statistic for the m-th subcarrier during the i-th data 
duration for conventional MRC receivers is thus 
obtained as

III. FUZZY-BASED CODE ALLOCATION SCHEME 
To examine the characteristics of diversity gain 
obtained from 2-D spreading, the orthogonal VSF codes 
[9] are generated with the processing gain 16. In OFDM 
systems, the frequency synchronization error will result 
in the devastated inter-carrier interference (ICI) to 
degrade the BER performance. Therefore, in order to 
focus much attention on the BER variations on the 
different 2-D spreading, we assume perfect subcarrier 
synchronization with no frequency offset and no 
nonlinear distortion and perfect subcarrier 
amplitude/phase estimation for OFCDM systems. The 
combination of OFDM signaling and CDMA scheme has 
one major advantage that it can lower the symbol rate in 
each subcarrier so that a longer symbol duration makes it 
easier to quasi-synchronize the transmissions [5]. 
Therefore, in this report, we assume a synchronous 
downlink channel, and then we discuss the BER 
performance of MC-CDMA systems with OVSF codes 
over frequency selective fading channels. 
When multiple users are active, the OVSF codes can 
be allocated to users sequentially by C16,1, C16,2,…, and 
C16,16. We call it sequential code allocation (SCA) 
scheme. However, due to the orthogonalization distorted 
in frequency and time selective channels, the BER is 
degraded due to the MAI in multi-user access systems. 
The MAI due to the out-orthogonality among the 
multiple access increases with the active number of users. 
Therefore, the performance of the OFCDM system can 
be improved by adequately selecting the 2-D spreading 
codes to compromise the diversity gain maximization 
and the MAIs minimization. 
To maintain the orthogonality between the active users, 
an orthogonalized code allocation (OCA) scheme was 
proposed to improve the SCA scheme in previous work 
[18]. In the OCA, the code allocated to the k-th user is 
according to the time spreading factor SFT. The OVSF

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
To examine the characteristics of diversity gain 
obtained from 2-D spreading, the OVSF codes [9] are 
generated with the processing gain 16. In order to focus 
much attention on the BER variations on the different 
2-D spreading, we assume perfect subcarrier 
synchronization with no frequency offset and no 
nonlinear distortion and perfect subcarrier 
amplitude/phase estimation for OFCDM systems. The 
combination of OFDM signaling and CDMA scheme has 
one major advantage that it can lower the symbol rate in 
each subcarrier so that a longer symbol duration makes it 
easier to quasi-synchronize the transmissions [5]. 
Therefore, in this report, we assume a synchronous 
downlink channel, and then we discuss the BER 
performance of MC-CDMA systems with OVSF codes 
over frequency selective fading channels.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this report, an FIS is proposed to improve 
the multi-user performance for 2-D spreading 
OFCDM systems over frequency selective fading 
channels. Simulation results show that the 
proposed FBCA scheme can suppress the MAIs 
induced by the non-orthogonality over time and 
frequency selective fading channels. Consequently, 
the FBCA scheme outperforms the OCA scheme 
in varying speed and number of users.

二、 與會心得 
報告人整個出國行程除了在檀香山(Honolulu)會場參加研討外，也前往夏威夷文化村參
觀，茲將所見所聞令人印象深刻者敘述如下: 
1. 原住民文化的保存與維護：美國是個非常重視各原住民文化的保護與與資源發展的國
家，參加本次大會之行程中，也前往其夏威夷文化村參觀參觀，觀賞其大洋洲各原住民文化
之表演，對原住民文化之重視令人敬佩。 
2.多用戶檢測器之設計、應用與實現：此為申請人之專長領域，然由於此主題在次世代
行動網路(MGWN)的時段場次，在本次會議中較屬於應用的部分，申請人則提出一些理論與
應用方法以解決未來行動痛通訊系統上之高資料傳輸率需求的問題。由於應用平行處理器及
DSP 處理器，部分平行干擾消除之演算法不但具可行性，也可大大提升系統容量及資料傳輸

構之實現等。 
3.環保與渡假的島嶼都市：此次行程中，會議地點在夏威夷檀香山，其生活環境雖然炎
熱，但其渡假旅館與海灘之規劃與管理非常專業，而且禁止捕魚，不但環保，使環境空氣非
常清新，沒有任何魚腥味，進而能讓渡假觀光客心情充份放鬆而愉悅。
