Abstract 
We try to passivate InSb compound semiconductor by using ALD grown Al2O3 film. An 
particular interfacial self-cleaning phenomenon is found in the ALD of Al2O3 on InSb substrate, 
using Al(CH3)3 (TMA) and H2O as the precursors. The native oxides of InSb are greatly removed 
from the interface through ligand exchange (substitution) reactions with the TMA precursor. 
Besides, intentional 100 cycles of TMA/Ar half ALD-cycle pulses and CP4A chemical clean are 
also applied to InSb surface before Al2O3 deposition. An Al2O3/InSb structure without residual 
native oxides is achieved by these surface pretreatments and in-situ self clean effect. With the 
removal of the native oxides from the interface, a clear transition from accumulation to depletion 
region and insignificant frequency dispersion are found in the capacitance-voltage relations, 
which reveals the releasing of the Fermi-level pinning.

The research about high mobility materials of III-V semiconductor has been an attractive 
topic recently. For the technology node of 22 nm and beyond, III-V compounds are the most 
potential one to substitute Si as the channel materials due to their high electron mobility, 
well-established technologies and compatibility of semiconductor process. The electron mobility 
and saturation speed of the III-V compounds and Si are listed in Table. 1. The main advantage of 
the III-V compound semiconductors is that the material can be operated at very low voltage bias 
with low power consumption and high speed. However, many essential challenges must be 
overcome for applications of III-V compounds that ( i ) searching for a compatible high-κ 
dielectric for surface passivation without Fermi-level pinning caused by the high interfacial states, 
[7-12] ( ii ) appropriate cleaning process for the surface of the III-V compounds, [13-16] ( iii ) 
integrating the III-V compounds epitaxially onto the Si substrate. [17-22] The successful 
integration of high-κ / III-V compound semiconductors will be a landmark of MOSFET 
application.

from the buildup of V elements at the interface and the oxides themselves. A buildup of the V 
elements can be understood by the reaction, 
2 3 2 32 4GaAs As O Ga O As+ ⎯⎯→ +  
Thermodynamically, the arsenic oxide is unstable in the presence of GaAs which leads to the 
formation of the elemental As. [24]  
Recently, Ga2O3, Ga2O3(Gd2O3) on GaAs by in-situ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and 
Al2O3 on GaAs as well as on InGaAs by ex-situ atomic layer deposition (ALD) have attracted 
great interest owing to their Fermi level unpinning for enhancement-mode (E-mode) MOSFET. 
[7-12] The ALD of high-dielectric-constant (high-κ) oxides, such as Al2O3 and HfO2, is 
particularly important because of its ability to grow ultrathin films very uniformly over large-area 
substrates based on sequences of self-limiting surface reaction, and thus it is the essential 
technique for fabrication of the alternative gate-dielectric to replace SiO2 for nanoscale Si-based 
MOSFET of the next generation. [25]  
To date, various surface treatments such as surface passivation using an interface control 
layer (ICL) or interface passivation layer (IPL) of Si, [26] Ge, [27] Si/Ge, Si/S, and Si/Ge/S, [28] 
sulfur compounds (e.g., (NH3)2S, [13] H2S, [14] and Na2S．9H2O [15] ), inorganic acid (e.g., HCl 
and HF), as well as surface cleaning using hydrogen or nitrogen plasma have been applied to 
unpin the interface Fermi level. However, these methods have not been identified as efficient 
approaches to preparing a high-quality interface comparable to the SiO2/Si system. Among these 
techniques, the combination of the sulfide and IPL passivation seems to be the most effective. Fig. 
3 [29] and Fig. 4 [30] show the efficacy of the IPL passivation on GaAs published recently by the

shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 A more effective interfacial self-cleaning effect was subsequently 
observed from the ALD of HfO2 films on In0.15Ga0.75As using tetrakis-(ethylmethylamino) 
hafnium (Hf(NCH3C2H5)4) as a metal precursor, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. [44] Recently, 
similar self-cleaning effects on In0.53Ga0.47As, [45] and GaAs [46] substrates were also found. The 
in situ “clean-out” of native oxides on III–V compound semiconductors during ALD is beneficial 
in eliminating the interfacial native oxide layer between high-κ dielectric films and compound 
semiconductors. The abrupt high-κ/semiconductor interface ensures the relaxation of the Fermi 
level pinning phenomenon and improves the scalability of III–V compound semiconductor 
devices.

Reference 44. [44] 
Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the interfacial self-cleaning effect 
including thermodynamics, charge unbalance, coordination number, and ligand-exchange 
chemical reactions. [9, 44-46] Although the exact reactions between native oxides and individual 
metal precursor were not known yet, we believe that the chemical ligand-exchange reactions 
between metal precursor and native oxides are more likely dominating the interfacial self 
cleaning effect. 
Therefore, in this study, ALD-Al2O3 films were grown on InSb compound semiconductors 
 12
Experiment 
The substrate used in this work was a commercially available Te-doped n-type (100) InSb 
with a doping level of 1015 cm−3. The deposition temperature was carried out at 200°C to meet the 
low process temperature requirement for InSb. A working pressure of 1 Torr with alternating 
pulses of TMA/Ar/H2O/Ar in a period of 3/3/3/3 s for each self-limiting cycle was used in the 
ALD of Al2O3 for 120 cycles on three different InSb substrates, which are listed in Table. 2. The 
first one (substrate A) is an InSb substrate covered with 3 nm thick native oxides from air 
exposure. The second one (substrate B) is the InSb pretreated with 100 cycles of TMA (3 s)/Ar 
(3s) purge, i.e., half-ALD cycle, on native-oxide-covered InSb in situ in the ALD reaction 
chamber. Notice that no water was purged into the reaction chamber in the above half-ALD-cycle 
process. The third one (substrate C) is the InSb pretreated with a conventional surface clean 
process for InSb including (i) dip in CP4A chemical solution for 2 min, (ii) rinse with deionized 
water for 3 min, (iii) rinse with methanol for 3 min, and (iv) dry by N2. [47] Three different 
substrates were then immediately loaded into the ultrahigh vacuum XPS chamber to study the 
surface composition and chemical states of each substrate. The XPS measurements were made 
with an Al Kα X-ray radiation source at a take-off angle, θ, of 45° relative to the surface plane, 
and were also employed after the ALD of Al2O3 on the three different InSb substrates to study the 
composition and chemical states of the Al2O3-passivated InSb samples. On the other hand, before 
Al2O3 deposition, surface morphologies were also investigated by the atomic force microscopy.  
The electrical characteristics of the Al2O3-passivated InSb in a metal-oxide-semiconductor 
(MOS) structure were also measured. The MOS structure was made with a Pt top electrode

In the “in-situ” cleaning process, the air-exposed InSb substrate was purged by TMA/Ar for 
100cycles and the AFM result is shown in Fig. 15. The roughness reduced from 10Å to 4.7Å after 
pre-pulsed by TMA/Ar. 
Both of the above surface treatments, either “ex-situ” or “in-situ”, improves surface 
morphology of the InSb substrate. The improvement of roughness is important for the electrical 
properties of MOS structure of InSb. From AFM analysis, the TMA/Ar purging for 100cycles and 
CP4A etching for 120sec can reduce the roughness down to ~4Å to providing a more uniform and 
smooth InSb surface.

Fig. 16 shows the XPS result of the above three samples. Spectra (i) in (a) and (b) are from 
the air-exposed surface of InSb. After exposing to atmosphere, there are about 3 nm thick native 
oxides grown on the surface. As marked in the figure, contributions from In2O3 and InSb can be 
deconvoluted from spectra (i) in (a) and contributions from Sb2O5, Sb2O3, and InSb from that in 
(b), respectively. Spectra (ii) in Fig. 16 (a) and (b) are those from the substrate after treating with 
100 cycles of TMA/Ar half-cycle purge. Comparing to spectrum (i), the peak position of In 3d5/2 
in (ii) has shifted toward a lower binding energy. It indicates that the contribution from In2O3 
oxide is reduced. The broader full width at half-maximum (FWHM) in Fig. 16 (a), spectrum (ii) 
is attributed to multi-oxidation states of indium after TMA/Ar surface treatment. A significant 
decrease of intensity from the Sb oxides in the peak of the Sb 4d spectrum (ii) is also observed, 
which also reveals that the Sb-related oxides can be greatly removed after the TMA/Ar treatment. 
A certain amount of Al2O3 also appears after TMA/Ar treatment, as shown in Fig. 16 (c). The 
oxidation of TMA in the TMA/Ar treatment should be induced from the reduction of the native 
oxides because no adscititious oxidant was present in the reaction process. In other words, a 
ligand exchange reaction between TMA and the native oxides must occur in the treatment. In Fig. 
16 (a) and (b), spectra (iii) are from the InSb surface after CP4A treatment and spectra (iv) are 
from the in situ sputtered InSb which contains no native oxides on the surface. The similarity in 
peak position, FWHM, and peak shape between (iii) and (iv) indicates that the native oxides are 
mostly eliminated after etching in CP4A chemical solution for 2 min. However, a slight amount 
of Sb2O3 is still detectable on the InSb surface, as seen from the appearance of a weak left 
shoulder in the Sb 4d spectrum (iii) of Fig. 16 (b). 
 26
and (ii) in Fig. 17 (a), weak signals of In2O3 are observed both on the surface and in the bulk of 
the Al2O3. As seen from spectrum (iii) in Fig. 16 (a), the signal from the native In2O3 (gray 
shadow area) can be observed also at the Al2O3/InSb interface after ALD-Al2O3 deposition, but 
the intensity is relatively reduced as compared to that from the air-exposed surface of InSb shown 
in Fig. 17 (a). In contrast, as observed from the Sb 4d spectra in Fig. 17 (b), the signals from Sb 
oxides on the top and in the interior of Al2O3 film are indistinguishable. Furthermore, the 
contribution from Sb2O5 is quite weak and only a slight amount of Sb2O3 (gray shadow area) can 
be resolved from spectrum (iii). The result indicates that the self-cleaning effect is more 
pronounced for the Sb-related oxides than In-related oxides in the ALD of Al2O3 with TMA. 
Fig. 17 (c) and (d) show the XPS results of Al2O3 on TMA/Ar treated InSb. There is no 
detectable residue of native oxides, either that of In or Sb, on the top and in the interior of Al2O3. 
Moreover, the Sb oxides are also undetectable at the Al2O3/InSb interface, although a slight 
amount, but much less than that observed from Fig. 17 (a), of In2O3 still remains. However, for 
the Al2O3 deposited on CP4A-treated InSb, both In- and Sb-related oxide signals are unresolved 
in the whole Al2O3/InSb structure, as shown in Fig. 17 (e) and (f). The above results clearly 
reveal that both in situ TMA/Ar treatments and ex situ CP4A chemical solution are beneficial for 
the enhancement of the self-cleaning effect in the elimination of the native oxides of InSb from 
the surface, bulk, and interface in the ALD of Al2O3 on InSb using TMA as a precursor. The XPS 
results of the residual In and Sb oxides in Al2O3 film from top to interface region on the three 
different pretreated substrates are summarized in Table. 5. 
 28
When the TMA, i.e., Al(CH3)3, was purged into the deposition chamber, it would react with 
the native oxides, i.e., In2O3 and Sb2O3 and Sb2O5, and form volatile products of In(CH3)3 and 
Sb(CH3)3 and Sb(CH3)5, as shown by the following hypothetical reactions

Thus, the appearance of Al2O3 in the TMA/Ar pretreatment shown in Fig. 16 (c) can be 
understood by these oxidation-reduction ligand exchange reactions. In the reactions, the TMA 
acts as the reductant and In2O3, Sb2O3, and Sb2O5 grown on the InSb surface act as the oxidant, 
leading to the products of Al2O3 and volatile In(CH3)3 and Sb(CH3)3. The above ligand-exchange 
reactions could continuously proceed by chemically inducing the rearrangement or out-diffusion 
of In and Sb cations to the surface of Al2O3 to react with TMA until the complete consumption of 
native oxides at the interface. 
Hinkle et al. have investigated the self-cleaning effect of TMA by in situ XPS, [46] and 
reported that the rate of the self-clean ligand exchange reactions is very fast and starts even at the 
first TMA purge. However, the clean efficiency of the 100 cycles of TMA/Ar pulses are not as 
high as we expected. As observed from spectra (ii) in Fig. 16 (a) and (b), although the intensity 
from native oxides has already decreased after treatment, it is still much higher than that from 
spectra (iii) in Fig. 17 (a) and (b) (after 120 cycles of normal ALD-Al2O3 deposition without any 
pretreatments). The reason for the low clean efficiency of the TMA/Ar half-cycle purge is 
probably that the volatility of the by-product In(CH3)3, Sb(CH3)3, and Sb(CH3)5 is relatively low

in Al2O3 for the former two samples. 
 
Fig. 18 Leakage current density, Jg (A/cm2), as a function of biasing voltage (volt) on Pt/Al2O3/InSb heterostructure 
having different surface pretreatments. 
The C-V curves measured at frequencies from 1 k to 100 kHz of the three MOS samples are 
shown in Fig. 19. Theoretical curves were also generated from the NCSU CVC7.0 simulation 
model. A slight difference in C-V relations was observed among the three samples as described 
below. The sample on TMA/Ar-treated InSb exhibits a lower capacitance than the others. It can 
be understood from previous XPS results that a certain amount of Al2O3 was formed from the 
ligand-exchange reactions during TMA/Ar pretreatment; thus, a thicker dielectric film was 
obtained, giving a lower capacitance. The flatband voltage (Vfb) of samples prepared on the three 
substrates shifts from -0.48 V (air-exposed substrate) to -0.10 V (TMA/Ar and CP4A pretreated 
substrates). It is because the former contains In2O3 at the interface, which possesses positively 
charged defects, [50] causing the shift of Vfb to a more negative value. The frequency dispersion

film on: (a) air-exposed InSb, (b) TMA/Ar half-ALD-cycle pretreated InSb, and (c) CP4A-etched InSb, respectively. 
All measurements were done at 77K. 
In conclusion, the ALD of Al2O3 using TMA as a metal precursor could provide a self-clean 
effect from the ligand-exchange reaction with the native oxides on InSb. The residual native 
oxides in the Al2O3/InSb substrate can be further eliminated by the introduction of an in situ 
TMA/Ar purge or ex situ CP4A solution treatment before the ALD of Al2O3. Therefore, the 
leakage current property of the Al2O3 film and the frequency dispersion in the 
capacitance–voltage relation of the Pt/Al2O3/InSb MOS structure can also be improved.
