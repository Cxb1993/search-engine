Abstract 
For the international express service industry, it is very important to deliver goods or 
provide services efficiently. The efficiency of pick-up service is mainly influenced by the courier 
route design. The presence of uncertain customer demands creates the need to design a priori tour 
instead of finding an optimal tour everyday. We formulate and analyze a multi-objective 
probabilistic traveling salesman problem (MOPTSP). The classical PTSP is defined as a problem 
of finding a prior tour of expected minimum length, with the strategy of visiting a random set of 
customers in the same order as they appear in the prior tour.  Instead of finding a prior tour of 
expected minimum length as the classical PTSP does, our objective is to find a prior optimal tour 
with respect to two objectives--the expected minimum length and the minimum probability of 
route failure, defined as route duration exceeds a given allowed duration threshold. Using the 
weighting method of multi-objective programming, the objective function of the problem 
(MOPTSP) is defined as the sum of the expected minimum length plus the weighted penalty 
times the probability of route failure.  An evolution algorithm is developed to efficiently find a 
near-optimal prior tour. The approximation of objective function is estimated by means of Monte 
Carlo sampling. In test problems for which exact solutions created by enumeration are available, 
the heuristic solution produces good solutions. The computation procedure appears to hold 
substantial promise for effective solution of practical applications. At last, we demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the model through a case study.
