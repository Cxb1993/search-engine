Abstract  
Controlled release carriers are often made into microspheres or tablets. Many have added 
drugs to tissue engineered scaffolds to promote tissue growth or reduce inflammation. However, 
systematic and quantitative characterization of porous tissue engineered scaffolds as release 
carriers have not been done. Chitosan and chitosan crosslinked with various concentrations of 
genipin were made into porous scaffolds. Their properties as controlled release carriers were 
measured and the effects of slowly releasing pentoxifylline (PTX) in suppressing inflammatory 
reactions in vitro were quantified.  
FT-IR spectra confirmed covalent bond formation between chitosan and genipin. As genipin 
increased from 0.01% to 0.1%, the crosslinked chitosan scaffolds swelled 0.5% to 1.8% less, had 
1.9-5% decrease in PTX release efficiencies, became more hydrophobic, were less favorable for 
initial cell attachment, had 4-20% increase in Young’s modulus and were more resistant to 
enzymatic degradation. The increase in chitosan concentration also had similar effects on 
scaffolds’ properties as genipin did. In vitro tests showed that when PTX was released more slowly, 
PTX became more effective in suppressing macrophage cells from releasing IL-6 and TNF-α.  
This work has demonstrated quantitative changes in chitosan scaffolds as sustained 
anti-inflammatory drug release carriers. The correlation between slow release of PTX and its 
efficacy in suppressing macrophage inflammatory reactions was established.

were put in glass tubes and froze overnight. The frozen samples were lyophilized in a freeze dryer. 
Lyophilized scaffolds were neutralized the same way as the films.  
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR) (n=6) 
Chitosan specimens were ground, mixed with KBr, and pressed into tabs. The specimens 
were scanned from 4000cm-1~400 cm-1 in a FTIR spectrometer. 
Contact angle (Hydrophilicity ) (n=6) 
Five microliters of DI water were placed on each polymer film. Static contact angles were 
measured using a contact angle meter. 
Scaffold morphology (Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM)) (n=3) 
Dried scaffolds were sliced and sputter coated with gold before placed in a SEM (Hitachi 
S-3000H, Japan). Microphotographs of the scaffold surfaces were taken.  
Swell ratio (n=4) 
After measuring the diameters (Do) of each dry scaffold, the scaffolds were placed in 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH=7.4) and their diameters were measured at each designated 
time point (Dt). The swell ratio at each time point was calculated as [(Dt-Do)/ Do]×100%.  
Release efficiency of pentoxifylline (PTX) (n=6) 
Each dry scaffold disc was loaded with 100μL PTX (20mg/ml) and left dry at room 
temperature overnight. Ten scaffold discs were placed in each beaker filled with 100mL of PBS 
and there were six beakers (n=6) for each polymer. All beakers were placed on a shaker (50 rpm) 
during the test. At each designated time point, 100μL of PBS was sampled and the same volume of 
PBS was replenished. The absorbance of PTX at 274nm was measured and converted to 
concentrations (Mt (μg/mL)). The release efficiency of the PTX was calculated as [(Mt / 
200μg/mL)] x100%.  
Degradation (n=6) 
A scaffold with an initial dry weight of Wo was placed in a 15mL centrifuge tube filled with 
5mL of lysozyme solution (70000U/mL PBS, pH=7.4). The tubes were placed in an incubator 
(37oC) and the lysozyme solution was changed every three days. On designated days, tubes were 
removed from the incubator and the remaining scaffolds were rinsed and air dried to obtain their 
dry weights (W). The percentage of weight loss was calculated as [(Wo-W)/Wo]x100%.  
Compression (n=6) 
Dry scaffolds were submerged in PBS overnight and excess liquid was removed before 
testing. A Universal Micro-tribometerwas used to obtain stress-strain curves. The speed of 
crosshead was 0.3mm/sec and a 10N load cell was used. Test stopped at 80% strain. The slope of 
the initial linear section of the stress-strain curve was used to estimate the Young’s modulus.   
Cell attachment (n=6) 
The bottom of each well of a 24-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) plate was coated with 
polymer solution and air dried. TCP surface served as positive control. The films were processed 
as described in section 2. Osteoblasts (3x105cells/mL) were seeded onto the films (1mL/well). At 
designated time points, unattached cells were counted to back calculate the number of attached 
cells. 
In vitro test of anti-inflammatory effect during controlled release (n=6) 
The test was done using C and C+0.1G scaffolds to compare the effect of different degrees of 
slow release. Scaffolds were loaded with 50μL of PTX (2mg/mL) and allowed to dry at room

Swell ratio 
Though the test was run for 90 minutes, to better show the initial swelling behavior, Figure 3 
only shows swell ratios of the scaffolds of the first 20 minutes. The swell ratios of the scaffolds at 
90 minutes are listed in Table 1. Scaffolds crosslinked with genipin swelled up more slowly than 
uncrosslinked scaffolds. 
Release efficiency 
By the end of 90 minutes, C, C+0.01G, C+0.03G, C+0.1G, and 2C+0.01G scaffolds released 
93.4%, 91.5%, 87.4%, 87.4%, and 83.9% respectively of their total amount of PTX loaded (Figure 
4).  
Degradation  
Crosslinking is known to change the enzymatic degradability of a hydrogelic material. The 
extent of degradation decreased as the concentration of genipin increased by day 21 (Figure 5). 
With the same genipin concentration, 2C+0.01G was less degradable than C+0.01G (p<0.05).

Anti-inflammatory effect of PTX slow release 
The test was done on the two groups with the most significant difference in release behavior 
while having same chitosan concentration, C and C+0.1G. Macrophage cells did not release 
TNF-α and IL-6 with the presence of scaffolds (DMEM group in Figure 7 (a) and (b)). After 
1μg/ml of LPS was added (DMEM+LPS), macrophage cells released similar amounts of 
TNF-α and IL-6 between the two groups. After PTX was added to the media containing LPS 
(DMEM+LPS+PTX), the amount of TNF-α and IL-6 decreased from DMEM+LPS (p<0.05) and 
there was no significant difference between C and C+0.1G. When PTX was slowly released from 
scaffolds (DMEM+LPS+PTX (slow release from scaffold)), the amounts of TNF-α and IL-6 further 
decreased from DMEM+LPS+PTX (p<0.05). Also, the amounts of TNF-α and IL-6 were 
significantly lower in C+0.1G group than in C (p<0.05).

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY 
Crosslinking and covalent bond formation between chitosan and genipin was confirmed by 
results from FT-IR. The shifted 1555 cm-1 is attributed to the formation of tertiary amine (NR3) 
between chitosan and genipin. The 1643 cm-1 was the C=O vibration from the amide group 
O=C-NHR between chitosan and genipin [20,21,23].

出席國際會議報告 
From October 2 to 6, 2008, I attended the 2008 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) 
Annual Fall Meeting in St. Louis, Missouri. The meeting ran from October 1 to 4 in the 
Renaissance Hotel. The topics covered interdisciplinary fields in medicine and engineering.  
On October 3, I attended the BMES Distinguished Achievement 
Lecture. The guest speaker was Dr. Chad A. Mirkin, who was the 
awarded Distinguished Achievement Lecturer. He is the Director of the 
International Institute for Nanotechnology and the George B. Rathmann 
Professor of Chemistry. His speech was titled “Nanostructures in 
Medicine.” Dr. Mirkin and his group have recently reported new 
methods for the control of protein expression using 
oligonucleotide-functionalized gold nanoparticle materials. These 
“antisense particles”, as well as similarly functionalized siRNA particles, 
exhibit a range of unique properties that make them very well-suited for 
gene regulation. 
I did not present a talk or a poster in the meeting but I saw a lot of interesting findings and 
met with a couple of people who were interested in collaboration. Dr. Joel Bumgardner is an 
Associate Professor of the Department of Biomedical Engineering in University of Memphis, 
Memphis, TN. His expertise is in biocompatibility and he focuses on the interaction of host 
cells/tissues with orthopeadic and dental/craniofacial materials. 
Dr. Bumgardner presented four posters in the Tissue Engineering 
and Biomaterials session, including “Antimicrobial Coatings 
Constructed from Chitosan for the Prevention of Peri-Implant 
Infection” and “In Vitro Evaluation of an Antibiotic Loaded Chitosan 
Film.” His study evaluated the release of antimicrobials from chitosan 
coatings, the degradation of the coatings, and the in vitro bioactivity of 
released agents against pathogens. Tetracycline or Chlorhexidine was 
mixed with chitosan in acetic or formic acid respectively. Solutions w- 
ere cast over silanated Ti surfaces with terminal groups for bonding chitosan. In this experiment, 
antimicrobial coatings were compared to coatings without antimicrobial agents and uncoated Ti. 
Their results showed that tetracycline coatings remained active against pathogens for 7 days while 
chlorhexidine coatings remained active for only 2 days. The molecular weight of the coatings 
significantly decreased after elution in culture medium. Their results suggest that chitosan coatings 
can be used to deliver antimicrobials for the prevention of dental implant infection. 
Dr. Bumgardner’s research expertise is similar to that of mine. We talked about collaboration

INTRODUCTION 
Acute or chronic inflammation often arises from the surgical process and the insertion of 
foreign objects such as implants. Fibrous/collagenous encapsulation induced by inflammation 
reactions is the major cause for implant failures [1-4]. Suppressing inflammatory reactions after 
implant insertion is believed to improve the success rate of implant surgeries [5]. 
Anti-inflammatory medicines have been known to be added to the biopolymeric scaffolds to be 
released after surgical procedures to suppress inflammation induced by implant insertion [6-13].  
Chitosan is a biocompatible natural polymer that is frequently studied as a material for 
sustained drug release [14-16] and for tissue engineered scaffolds [17,18]. It is often chemically 
crosslinked to modify its abilities in releasing medicines and to improve its biocompatibility 
[19-23]. Genipin is a natural compound that has been used to crosslink chitosan beads/particles for 
drug delivery [20,24] and tissue scaffolds [22]. In vivo results have shown good biocompatibility 
of chitosan gel crosslinked with genipin [22,25]. After being crosslinked with genipin, chitosan 
membranes became more hydrophilic, had higher tensile strength, a lower swell ratio, lower cell 
attachment, and were less susceptible to enzyme degradation [21,24,26].  
Chemical compounds are often added to tissue regeneration scaffolds to promote tissue 
growth and inhibit inflammatory reactions [6-8,13,27,28]. However, often qualitative but not 
quantitative studies were done on their effects on cellular performances and tissue reactions. 
Medicines in use have varying strengths and concentrations, which affect how consistently they 
perform and any side effects that may occur. It is important to quantitatively characterize the 
scaffolds’ properties related to sustained drug release and how changes in these properties should 
affect subsequent biological reactions. 
There is lack of study in how scaffolds behave as drug carriers. The purpose of this work was 
to test how degrees of crosslinking changed scaffolds’ properties as a drug delivery agents and 
how the changes affect the drugs’ biological effects. It was hypothesized that higher degrees of 
crosslinking would be more effective in slowing down drug release from the scaffolds and that 
different release rates would cause the drug to have different biological effects. The model drug 
used in this work was pentoxifylline (PTX). PTX is an anti-inflammatory drug that has been 
known to inhibit immune cells from producing inflammatory cytokines [29-32] as well as to treat 
or prevent fibrosis [33-35].  
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, MO, USA, unless specified otherwise. 
Preparation of chitosan and genipin-crosslinked chitosan solutions 
Chitosan was dissolved in 2 v/v% acetic acid solution. Genipin was dissolved in deionized 
water. Chitosan and genipin solutions were stirred together for an hour before they were further 
processed into films and scaffolds. The final concentrations of chitosan and genipin in the 
solutions were 1% chitosan (C), 1% chitosan with 0.01% genipin (C+0.01G), 1% chitosan with 
0.03% genipin (C+0.03G), 1% chitosan with 0.1% genipin (C+0.1G), and 2% chitosan with 0.01% 
genipin (2C+0.01G).  
Making films and scaffolds  
One milliliter of the polymer solution was coated on the bottom of each polystyrene petri 
dishand air dried. Coated films were neutralized in NaOH. Films were used for two tests only: 
contact angle and cell attachment. The rest of the tests were done on scaffolds. Polymer solutions

temperature. Macrophage cells (RAW 264.7, ATCC, VA) were seeded in 24-well TCP plates. Cell 
culture media was then removed and four test groups were set up- DMEM (cells were incubated 
with DMEM and a blank scaffold), DMEM+LPS (cells incubated with DMEM+1μg/mL LPS+ a 
blank scaffold), DMEM+LPS+PTX (cells incubated with DMEM+ 1μg/mL LPS+100μg/mL 
PTX+ a blank scaffold), and DMEM+LPS+PTX(slow release from scaffold)  (cells incubated with 
DMEM+1μg/mL LPS+a scaffold loaded with 200μg PTX).  
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to activate macrophage cells to release inflammatory 
factors [37]. Six hours later, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the 
media were measured.  
 Statistical analysis  
All data is presented as average ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was conducted 
using two- way ANOVA with tukey tests. Difference between Genipin-crosslinked chitosan and 
chitosan was declared when p<0.05.  
RESULTS 
FTIR 
Chitosan had typical absorbance at 1592 cm-1 and 1648 cm-1 (Figure 1), which represented 
N-H and -C-N vibration. After crosslinked by genipin, the two peaks shifted to 1555 cm-1 and of 
1643 cm-1 and the ratio of the two peaks increased.

Contact angle 
Contact angle is an index of how hydrophilic a material is, the higher the angle is, the less 
hydrophilic it is. The contact angle results are listed in Table 1. After adding 0.1% genipin, the 
contact angles increased slightly (p<0.05). Genipin at 0.01% and 0.03% did not significantly 
change chitosan’s contact angle (p>0.05). 2C+0.01G had the highest contact angle of all (p<0.05). 
SEM 
The texture of the walls of the pores of crosslinked scaffolds was less smooth than that of 
uncrosslinked scaffolds (Figure 2). This was especially apparent with 0.1% genipin. Also the pores 
were less connective with higher genipin concentration. The pores of 2C+0.01G (Figure 2(e)) 
seemed smaller and less interconnected compared to C+0.01G.

Compression 
Lower concentrations of genipin (0.01%, 0.03%) did not have a significant influence on a 
scaffold’s compressional strength. When genipin concentration went up to 0.1%, crosslinked 
scaffolds’ Young’s modulus was significantly higher than that of uncrosslinked ones (p<0.05) 
(Table 1).   
Cell attachment  
Uncrosslinked chitosan had the highest initial cell attachment of all samples. Cell attachment 
decreased as the concentrations of genipin increased (Figure 6).

The crosslinked polymer chain structure is more branched and prevents polymer chains from 
stretching and swelling. The more hydrophobic nature of the crosslinked chitosan also prevented 
water from fast-entering the scaffolds and contribute to the decreased initial swelling.  
The higher hydrophobicity and branched polymer chains in crosslinked chitosan also 
prevented effective mass transfer in the polymer and thus the reduction of release efficiency. 
Bhattarai et al. [19] reported that protein release efficiency decreased with the addition of genipin 
to chitosan as well as with prolonged crosslinking time.  
Lysozyme targets and hydrolyzes glycosidic bonds (C-O-C) between chitosan units instead 
of amide bonds formed between genipin and chitosan. Therefore crosslinking with genipin makes 
chitosan more resistant to lysozyme degradation [20,21]. 
Crosslinking made chitosan stiffer (higher Young’s modulus) because the additional amide 
bonds formed between chitosan chains strengthened the molecular structure of the material.  
 In the cell attachment test, no serum protein was added to the cell culture media. The 
attachment was directly between cells and the polymers. A mammalian cell prefers to attach to 
more hydrophilic [41,42].  
The slow release of PTX more effectively prevented macrophage from releasing 
pro-inflammatory factors compared to the direct addition. Kofuji et al. [25] implanted chitosan 
beads retaining the anti-inflammatory drug prednisolone (PS) into the back of mice and 
investigated the therapeutic efficacy of sustained PS release against local inflammation. They 
found inflammation significantly reduced after implantation of chitosan beads when compared 
with injection of PS suspension.  
Our results supported the hypothesis that slower release of PTX could better effects in 
inhibiting inflammatory reactions in macrophage cells in vitro.
