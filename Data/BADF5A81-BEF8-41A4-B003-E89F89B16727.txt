schemes are proposed to provide service 
differentiation and the associated performance 
analyses are performed in [4], [5] and [6].  
 Our study is basically an extension of the 
results in [1][2], except that the priority 
mechanisms in [4] are incorporated. Specifically, 
a multi-dimensional discrete time Markov chain 
and an M/G/1/K queueing model together are 
used to describe the considered system. The 
associated steady state probability distribution is 
derived iteratively. In our work, an analytical 
method to calculate the performance measures is 
proposed and simulation program written in C 
language is run to validate the analytical results. 
The performance measures of interest are 
throughput, average delay, and blocking 
probability. The effect of the frame arrival rate 
on the performance measures is studied.

3.1. Mathematical Model 
We consider a priority based IEEE 802.11 
wireless LAN based on DCF. We focus on the 
scenarios with ideal channel conditions, i.e., no 
channel-induced errors. Two parameters which 
are initial window size and increasing factor are 
changed in order to provide service 
differentiation. The frames arrive to each station 
according to a Poisson process with frame 
arrival rate λ . The RTS/CTS mechanism is 
used for frame transmission. Each user has a 
finite buffer  to accommodate frames that can 
not be served upon arrival. Here, we assume 
there are N classes users in the system and each 
class has a fixed number hn  of users where 
(1, )h N∈  and each user has a finite buffer. To 
simplify notation, the analysis below is aimed to 
class-j users. 
It is assumed that when a class-j station 
with a frame ready to send observes an idle 
channel for DIFS , it randomly chooses a time 
slot within the backoff window size jiW , where 
i is the number of consecutive transmission 
failures for that frame. Specifically, the backoff 
window size 0
i
ji j jW Wα= × , where 0jW  is the 
initial window size and jα  is the window 
increasing factor of class-j users. Note that there 
is an upper limit for the backoff window size, 
that is, the maximum backoff window size MAXW . 
In other words, 0min( , )
i
ji j j MAXW W Wα= × . 
Equivalently, the maximum backoff stage is m 
such that jm MAXW W= . Once the station 
transmits a frame successfully and receives an 
ACK from receiver, it will reset jiW  to the 
initial window size 0jW . Furthermore, we 
assume that each frame of class-j users collides 
with other frames with a constant probability 
jp  regardless of the number of retransmissions 
it has encountered. 
In this model, we model the considered 
system as a multi-dimensional discrete-time 
Markov process. Specifically, we extend the 
model in [1] to one consisting of multiple 
dimensions. We use an M/G/1/K queueing 
model to approximate the steady state 
probability of each surface. For example, the 
sum of all the state probabilities of class-j users 
in the d-th surface is equal to the probability jdP  
that there are d frames in the station buffer 
according to the M/G/1/K queueing model. 
Furthermore, we model each surface as a 
bi-dimensional discrete-time Markov process 
with the state {p(t),s(t),v(t)}, where p(t) denotes 
the class of users, s(t) denotes the number of 
retransmissions, and v(t) denotes the present 
value of backoff counter. 
Once all the transition probabilities are found, 
the associated steady state equations can be 
derived. The closed-form solution to those state 
equations is derived below iteratively. For clarity, 
we neglect the parameter used to indicate the 
number of frames in the station buffer. Let 
, , lim { ( ) , ( ) , ( ) }j i k tb P p t j s t i v t k→∞= = = = , 
(0, )i m∈ , (0, 1)ik W∈ − , be the steady state 
probability that the backoff stage is i  and the 
backoff counter is k  for a particular surface j. 
We follow the same procedure to derive all the 
steady state probabilities as in [1][4].
