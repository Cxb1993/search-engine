Stranskii-Krastanov growth mode of 
quantum dots (QDs), the size of dots and 
thickness of wetting layers are hard to change. 
As a result, the absorption region is limited 
to a certain wavelength. However, the 
atmospheric transmission windows are at 
3-5.3 μm and 7.5-14 μm, and a multi-color 
photodetection covering these windows is 
attractive in thermal imaging, target 
identification, medical and other applications 
[3]. The multi-color detection has been 
demonstrated using the 
quantum-dots-in-a-well structures [4]-[6], 
and the focal plane arrays based on these are 
also designed [7]-[8]. The dual-band detector 
has been demonstrated by the method of 
homojunction interfacial workfunction 
internal photoemission, too [9]. Most of the 
broadband photodetectors demonstrated so 
far are based on III-V materials. With the 
advantages of integration and low cost [10], 
the Si-based broadband detectors are highly 
desirable, and we have demonstrated such 
detectors with the SiGe/Si QD structure. 
A metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) 
SiGe/Si QDIP with δ doping in the Si spacers 
is presented. The δ doping provides the QDs 
a sufficient hole concentration and forms 
δ-doping wells in Si. A δ-doping quantum 
well (QW) can be formed in the valence band 
[11] due to the strong electric field formed by 
localization of ionized dopants and band gap 
narrowing by delocalization of acceptor 
states in the reciprocal space. The holes in 
QDs and δ-doping QWs could be excited by 
mid-wavelength infrared (3.7-6 μm detection) 
and long-wavelength infrared (6-16 μm 
detection), respectively, and the spectrum 
covers most of the 3-5.3 μm and 7.5-14 μm 
atmospheric transmission windows. 
The 20-period SiGe/Si QD layers on 
p–type (100) Si wafer grown by ultrahigh 
vacuum chemical vapor deposition 
(UHVCVD) were used to fabricate MOS 
tunneling diodes [12] with a low-temperature 
(50oC) liquid phase deposition (LPD) oxide 
(Fig. 1) [13]. The LPD oxide is estimated to 
be 2 nm thick. 
 
Fig. 1.  The schematic structure of the MOS 
SiGe/Si QDIP. The boron (1019 cm-3) was 
δ introduced in the middle of the growth of 
each Si spacer layer. The thickness of the 
δ-doping well is estimated to be ~ 1 nm. 
 
The TEM photograph of SiGe QD 
structure is shown in Fig. 2 (a). Due to 
different in situ annealing times and 
interdiffusion between Si and Ge, the top 
SiGe QD with shorter annealing time after 
formation has a higher Ge concentration (~60 
%) as compared to the bottom SiGe QD (~ 
40%) [14]-[15], which suffers longer 
annealing time after formation. The top SiGe 
layer is more significant for the operation of 
detectors due to the higher electric field in 
the depletion region for photo-carrier 
collection. The Ge concentration in the top 
wetting layer is also analyzed through energy 
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Fig. 2 
(b) shows that the Ge concentration in the 
SiGe wetting layer is only ~ 20%. The SiGe 
layers were separated by 80 nm Si spacer 
layers, and boron (1019 cm-3) was 
δ introduced in the middle of the growth of 
each Si spacer layer. The thickness of the 
δ-doping well is estimated to be ~ 1 nm, and 
the corresponding sheet concentration of 
each layer is 1012 cm-2. Al was deposited on 
the oxide to form the gate electrode with an 
area of 3x10-2 cm2.

Fig. 4.  T Spectral response of the δ-spacer 
sample at 0 and 1 V (15 K). The inset shows 
the response at shorter wavelength, 
indicating cutoff wavelength at 2.37 μm at 
0V and 2.53 μm at 1 V. 
 
The valance band bound state energy can 
be calculated by the k‧p method. Since the 
SiGe QD region has a wide base (~100 nm) 
and a short height (~6nm), the QD region can 
be approximated by the QW in k ‧ p 
calculation. The energy of the ground state in 
QDs should be lower for holes than that in 
wetting layers, since the SiGe layer at QD 
region are thicker and with higher Ge 
concentration. Most holes are hence in the 
QDs instead of the wetting layers. The 
calculated energy levels in QDs are shown in 
Fig. 5. 
 
Fig. 5.  The subband structure in the SiGe 
QD region. For LH1, the numbers of states, 
which equal the integration of density of 
state versus energy, at k = 0.03 ~ 0.04 A-1 are 
larger than those at k = 0 ~ 0.01 A-1 due to 
the much quicker increase of energy. 
 
The schematic energy levels and the 
significant transitions in SiGe/Si QDs are 
shown in Fig. 6. The parameters 
(ΔEv(Si/SiGe)=0.54eV, well thickness=6 nm) 
in k ‧ p calculation for QD region are 
selected to match the calculated result of E1 
with the measured data (2.37 μm).

The 1.8-2.37 μm absorption results from the 
intervalence band transition (E1 in Fig. 6) 
between the ground state of heavy hole (HH1) 
and continuum states. When the applied 
voltage increases from 0 V to 1 V, the cutoff 
wavelength shifts from 2.37 μm (523meV) to 
2.53 μm (490meV) (Fig. 4). Holes excited by 
photons with energy less than the energy 
difference between the ground state and the 
barrier can tunnel through the triangular 
barrier at 1 V (Fig. 6). The red shift is 
characteristic of bound-to-continuum 
transition [16]-[17]. 
The hole concentration at the ground state 
of light hole (LH1) is smaller than that of 
HH1. Therefore, the LH1-to-continuum 
transition should be much weaker than the 
HH1-to-continuum transition, and no 
obvious absorption is observed. 
The 3.7-6 μm absorption results from the 
intersubband transition (E2 in Fig. 6) between 
the ground state of light hole (LH1) and the 
second excited state of light hole (LH3) in 
the SiGe QDs. For LH1, the numbers of 
states, which equal the integration of density 
of state versus energy, at k = 0.03 ~ 0.04 A-1 
are larger than those at k = 0 ~ 0.01 A-1 due 
to the much quicker increase of energy (Fig. 
5). Hence, the measured peak wavelength 
(4.9 μm) of LH1-to-LH3 transition matches 
 8
most between Si and SiGe. The long 
wavelength transition in the δ-SiGe01 sample 
cannot originate from intraband transition of 
SiGe QW itself due to the QW’s shallow 
depth, where the cutoff wavelength should be 
longer than 16.5 μm (75meV). The spectrum 
of the δ-SiGe01 sample is only measured 
under the bias of 1 V. At 0 V, without the 
help of tunneling though the triangular 
barrier, the photogenerated carriers cannot be 
collected (Fig. 8). No absorption spectrum 
from the δ-doping well (6-16 μm) is 
observed with the δ-QD sample. Since the 
valence band barrier of the SiGe QD is large 
enough to block the photoexcited holes from 
the δ-doping well, the photoexcited carriers 
can not be collected by the electrode (Fig. 8). 
For the LH1-to-LH3 absorption, the peak 
of the δ-QD sample is at the shorter 
wavelength as compared to that of the 
δ-spacer sample. The smaller wavelength of 
the δ-QD sample is probably due to the many 
body effect, since the larger hole 
concentration is in the QDs. The many body 
effect can increase the intersubband 
transition energy [21]-[22].

long-wavelength infrared at the δ-doping 
layer. There may be SO level outside the 
δ-doping well.  
 
The intensity of light source versus 
wavelength is shown as the curve indicated 
by LI in Fig. 7. The LI is measured by the 
internal detector of the FTIR system, and the 
fixed separation between light source and the 
internal detector results in absorption from 
the measurement environment. Note that the 
obvious absorption in LI curve at 4.3 μm and 
5-8 μm is due to the absorption by CO2 and 
H2O, respectively [23]-[24].  Our test 
sample in chamber is then line up to the light 
source of Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 2000, and 
the original spectrum is measured. The 
original spectrum should be divided by the 
LI value in order to get the relative 
responsivity (arbitrary unit). Note that our 
test sample is put in the low-temperature and 
vacuum chamber. The chamber is close to 
the light source, and the absorption from the 
environment is suppressed. The suppressed 
absorption from the environment may result 
in extra narrow artifacts as shown in Fig. 7. 
After the spectrum measurement, the sample 
in chamber is moved out to line up with a 
blackbody source (Not shown in Fig. 3). The 
blackbody radiation at high temperature is 
then used to calibrate the absolute 
responsivity (A/W). The KRS-5 window has 
a quite uniform transmission (0.7) in the 
wavelength range we study, and will not 
result in distortion of the spectrum except for 
the magnitude. The value of transmission of 
the window of 0.7 is counted in calibration of 
the absolute responsivity [25]. 
 
Thin-Film Ge Detectors: 
The GOI MOS detector was fabricated by 
wafer bonding and smart-cut [26]-[27]. The 
surface roughness of Ge is ~ 7 nm after 
smart-cut. Al with a large ring area was 
evaporated on Ge to form the ohmic contact. 
The low-temperature LPD oxide and Pt gate 
electrode were used as the gate stack inside 
the Al ring. Fig. 9 shows the structure of the 
GOI MOS detector. Under infrared exposure 
(1 mW) at the inversion bias, the excess 
electron-hole pairs are generated in 
semiconductor and contribute to the 
photocurrent. The dark/photo current of the 
0.8-μm-thick-Ge GOI MOS detector are 
shown in Fig. 10. At -2 V, the responsivities 
at 850 nm, 1.3 μm, and 1.55 μm are 0.22 
A/W, 0.19 A/W, and 0.04 A/W, respectively.
