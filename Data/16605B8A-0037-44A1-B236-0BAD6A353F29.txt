Abstract 
We have studied the single-degree-of-freedom (1-dof) vortex induced vibration of a 
transversely spring-supported rigid circular cylinder with low mass-damping near a 
plane wall by computational fluid dynamics techniques. The Cartesian grid method 
with cut cell approach developed and matured in the latest three-year project, NSC 
96-2221-E-022-009-MY3, was selected to simulate fluid flows. We invoked the 
second-order Runge-Kutta method to integrate the equations of motion of the cylinder. 
Results show that proximity to a wall can be either advantage or disadvantage, in 
terms of structural safety (especially fatigue failure), depending on the gap ratio. 
Behaviors with various structural materials and far upstream flow velocities other than 
those studied in the present work must be analyzed in the future to complete the 
understanding of this physical phenomenon.

physical experiments (Khalak and Williamson, 1996; Khalak and Williamson, 1999; 
Govardhan and Williamson, 2000). The main results can be summarized as follows. For 
a cylinder with low mass ratio m* (structure mass/displaced fluid mass) and damping 
ratio ζ, the response amplitude A depends strongly on the free-stream velocity U and the 
plot of A versus U presents three distinct response branches; namely the initial branch, 
the upper branch and the lower branch. The upper branch is absent in the classical high 
mass-damping cases (Feng, 1968). The transition between the initial and upper branches 
is found to be hysteretic, while the transition from the upper to lower branch is assumed 
to be linked with an intermittent switching in response with a jump in phase difference 
between the lift force and cylinder response by about 180°. Two frequencies exist 
simultaneously in the initial branch. In the upper and lower branches, the 
vortex-shedding frequency is synchronized with the response frequency of the cylinder.  
The phenomenon of synchronization can occur for a range of U which depends 
primarily on m*. Moreover, they found experimentally that there is a correspondence of 
the 2S mode (two single vortices shed per cycle) with the initial branch, and the 2P 
mode (two pair vortices shed per cycle) with the lower branch. The 2P mode was also 
observed in the upper branch, but the second vortex of each pair is much weaker than 
the first one. Experimental results show that the response in the upper branch is less 
periodic and is subjected to more random disturbance than that in the lower branch. 
Such distinctions are more remarkable with smaller m* and ζ (Khalak and Williamson, 
1999; Govardhan and Williamson, 2000). However, the random characteristics of the 
response in the upper branch are not well understood. Moreover, few numerical studies 
have reported the 2P mode (Blackburn et al., 2001; Lucor et al., 2005). The debate 
remains on the existence of the 2P mode as a steady-state pattern. Williamson and 
Govardhan (2008) briefly summarized fundamental results and discoveries related to 
VIV with very low mass and damping. 
In recent years, more and more researchers investigated VIV by CFD techniques 
because modern powerful computing platforms can afford computing speed and 
memory capacity required to solve such a complicated physical process. Guilmineau 
and Queutey (2004) used a RANS code to simulate a case experimentally investigated 
by Khalak and Williamson (1996). They predicted a 2P mode in the lower branch and a 
high amplitude of response. However, they did not explain inconsistency with the 
experimental results, such as lost of the upper branch, always monotonic response, and 
much lower frequency in the lock-in region. Wanderley et al. (2009) used the 
Roe-Sweby scheme to solve the slightly compressible RANS equations written in 
general curvilinear coordinates and the k– turbulence model to simulate the turbulent 
flow in the wake of a circular cylinder. Their numerical results agree remarkably well 
with the experimental data of Khalak and Williamson (1996). Al Jamal and Dalton 
(2005) reviewed recent numerical studies on VIV of a circular cylinder and investigated 
the irregular behavior of the phase angle.

reaching numerical convergence. We invoked the second-order Runge-Kutta method to 
integrate the equations of motion. A linear extrapolation scheme based on the current 
and previous time step is used to estimate values of 
y,hydroF  at intermediate stages and 
the next time step. 
Finally, in the area of the present study, a mass-spring-damper system is usually 
characterized by another set of three parameters: mass ratio, m , structural natural 
frequency in air (or vacuum), 
nf , and damping ratio,  . Their definitions are

4.1 Validation by a high mass-damping isolated circular cylinder 
The system parameters are ﬁrst set according to Anagnostopoulos and Bearman (1992) 
experiments as: m* = 149, nf  = 7.016 Hz,   = 0.0012. The reduced velocity is 
varied between 5.87 and 7.83. The change in reduced velocity is achieved by altering 
the ﬂow velocity, hence the Reynolds number will also change according to Re =

4.2 Effect of gap ratio for a low mass-damping circular cylinder 
In the same way, simulations were performed for cases with various gap ratios for Re = 
200, m* = 10,   = 0.01, and 4.8U   . Fig. 2 presents vertical displacements of the 
cylinder center as function of time with G/D = 31.5, 0.7, and 0.5. The cylinder in the 
case with G/D = 31.5 can be regarded as an isolated cylinder and has been investigated 
by Leontini et al. (2006). The present maximum amplitude of this case (top plot in Fig. 
2), 0.48, is close to that of Leontini et al. (2006), 0.495. The three plots in Fig. 2 exhibit 
three major effects of the gap ratio on the amplitude of the system response. First, the 
vertical displacement is unsymmetrical to the original equilibrium position, yc = 0, for 
G/D = 0.7 and 0.5. Second, the maximum downward displacement decreases with 
decreasing gap ratios while the maximum upward displacement hardly depends on the 
gap ratio. Third, the envelope of maximum displacements becomes flatter when the gap 
ratio is smaller. The three effects together make unclear how structural safety, especially 
fatigue failure, is related to the gap ratio.  
5. Conclusions 
This project has executed preliminary study of the gap-ratio effect on 1-dof VIV of a 
low mass-damping circular cylinder near a plane wall. Proximity to a wall can be either 
advantage or disadvantage depending on the gap ratio. Definitely, structural material (in 
terms of m*,  , and U  ) and the far upstream flow velocity (in terms of Re) must be 
involved as well in judging whether positive or negative a specific gap ratio is to 
structural safety.
