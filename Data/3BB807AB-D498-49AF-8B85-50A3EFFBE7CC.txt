Abstract 
The conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models are to evaluate each 
decision-making unit (DMU) with a set of most favorable weights of performance indices. 
The efficient DMUs obtained from the conventional DEA construct an efficient (best-practice) 
frontier. The conventional DEA can be considered as identifying good (efficient) performers 
in the most favorable scenario. However, in today’s vulnerable and competitive business 
climate, corporate bankruptcies are common occurrences among companies of any sizes and 
in all businesses. The potential companies who will go out of business first usually are the 
ones of least competitiveness in comparison with others as scenario is getting more 
unfavorable, especially when an economic depression or a financial crisis occurs. For the 
purpose of identifying bad performers such as bankrupt firms in the least favorable 
(worst-case) scenario, we developed a series of three approaches in this study. The first 
approach is a radial worst-practice frontier DEA (WPF-DEA) model in which the “worst 
efficient” DMUs construct a worst-practice frontier. We further proposed a classification 
procedure in this approach for distinguishing the worst performers from the bad ones as well 
as distinguishing the best performers from the good ones in both the most favorable and 
worst-case scenarios. To identify bad performers together with the slack values we formulate

1. Introduction 
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has become a widely used methodology for evaluating 
relative efficiency. DEA is a nonparametric fractional linear programming approach designed 
specifically to measure relative efficiency in situations in which there are multiple inputs and 
outputs and there is no obvious objective way of aggregating either inputs or outputs into a 
meaningful index of productive efficiency. No assumptions are made regarding the manner in 
which a DMU converts inputs into outputs. 
The mathematical development of DEA can be traced to Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes [1]. 
They extended the idea of estimating technical efficiency with respect to a production frontier. 
Following the similar efficiency concept, DEA models establish an efficient frontier among 
the units based on a comparison process in which the ratio scales of weighted sum of outputs 
to that of inputs are evaluated. The units on this frontier are efficient units and the rest are 
deemed inefficient. Cooper et al. [2] pointed out that the set of optimal weights for the DMUo, 
the decision-making unit to be evaluated, are actually the set of most favorable weights for the 
DMUo in the sense of maximizing the efficiency ratio scale subjectively. 
Most of the DEA models and their applications in literature are in the category of most 
favorable scenario. They focus on identifying the good (efficient) performers and therefore 
ranking all the units according to the efficiency scores based on efficient frontier which is 
called “best-practice frontier” in this study. Many mathematical and statistical techniques 
have been presented in DEA methodologies, mostly with the basic purpose of increasing the 
discriminating power of DEA and ranking the DMUs. 
However, in today’s vulnerable and competitive business climate, corporate bankruptcies 
and reorganizations are common occurrences among companies of any sizes and in all 
businesses. The potential companies who will go out of business first usually are the ones of 
least competitiveness in comparison with others as scenario is getting more unfavorable,

2. Literature Review 
2.1. DEA framework 
Conventional DEA models can be traced back to Charnes et al. [1], we first consider CCR 
model as the conventional DEA model for comparison with our WPF-DEA model. We initiate 
our discussions of the WPF-CCR to be formulated by restating the original CCR-DEA from a 
meaningful managerial perspective. 
To describe the DEA efficiency measurement, we assume there are n DMUs and the 
performance of each DMU, say DMUj, is characterized by a production process of m inputs 
(xij; i = 1, 2, …, m) to yield s outputs (yrj; r = 1, 2, …, s). To estimate efficiency score of a 
specific DMUo, the DMU to be evaluated, we solve

The objective is to obtain weights v = ( iv
 ; i = 1, …, m) and u = ( ru
 ; r = 1, …, s) that 
maximize the ratio of CCRoE . By virtue of the constraints, the objective value 
CCR
oE
  is at 
most 1. The ( , ) v u  obtained as an optimal solution for (1) results in a set of most favorable 
weights for the DMUo in the sense of maximizing the ratio scale of 
CCR
oE . 
Therefore, we may interpret this evaluation procedure from managerial perspective as 
follows. To evaluate DMUo, analyst puts DMUo in a most favorable scenario to see how good 
its performance can be. Thus, original CCR model is considered formulating in most 
favorable scenario.

model, etc. In their ranking method, DMUs are compared against a full-inefficient frontier. 
This method can be used to rank all DMUs to get analytic information about the system, and 
also to rank only efficient DMUs to discriminate between them. They mention a radial and a 
slacks-based model based on this point of view. 
Wang and Luo [11] introduce two virtual decision making units (DMUs) called ideal 
DMU (IDMU) and anti-ideal DMU (ADMU) into the data envelopment analysis (DEA). One 
evaluates DMUs from the viewpoint of the best possible relative efficiency, while the other 
evaluates them from the perspective of the worst possible relative efficiency. The two 
distinctive efficiencies are combined to form a comprehensive index called the relative 
closeness (RC) to the IDMU just like the well-known TOPSIS approach in multiple attribute 
decision making (MADM). The RC index is then used as the evidence of overall assessment 
of each DMU, based on which an overall ranking for all the DMUs can be obtained. 
Wu [12] considers a previous article published by Wang and Luo [11] where data 
envelopment analysis (DEA) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal 
solution (TOPSIS) are integrated in ranking of decision-making units (DMUs). Wu [12] finds 
that their approach is problematic in employing the negative ideal point (NIP) for DEA 
computation. Their ideal point based models rely on using conflicting efficiency concepts. We 
slightly revised the models so that a DEA analysis using TOPSIS idea can be performed. 
Numerical demonstration reveals that our approach produces a ranking result that is consistent 
with that in previous studies. 
Amirteimoori [13] points out that the performance of a DMU obtained from the traditional 
DEA models depends on the identified efficient frontier characterized by the DMUs with a 
unity efficiency score and this radial measure of the traditional DEA models is calculated 
from optimistic viewpoint for each DMU, because, it is assumed as the radial measure that 
deals with input excess. He proposes an alternative efficient measure by using efficient and 
anti-efficient frontiers. He introduces two sets: production possibility set (PPS) and 
 15 
DMU: the best relative efficiency and the worst relative efficiency. The conventional DEA 
considers only the best relative efficiency. It is argued that the two different efficiencies 
should be considered together and any approach considers only one of them is biased. They 
propose to integrate the two different efficiencies into a geometric average efficiency, which 
measures the overall performance of each DMU. It is found that the geometric average 
efficiency has better discriminating power than either of the two efficiencies. 
Johnson and McGinnis [17] In the use of peer group data to assess individual, typical or 
best practice performance, the effective detection of outliers is critical for achieving useful 
results, particularly for two-stage analyses. In the DEA-related literature, prior work on this 
issue has focused on the efficient frontier as a basis for detecting outliers. An iterative 
approach for dealing with the potential for one outlier to mask the presence of another has 
been proposed but not demonstrated. They propose using both the efficient frontier and the 
inefficient frontier to identify outliers and thereby improve the accuracy of second stage 
results in two-stage nonparametric analysis. The iterative outlier detection approach is 
implemented in a leave-one-out method using both the efficient frontier and the inefficient 
frontier and demonstrated in a two-stage semi-parametric bootstrapping analysis of a classic 
data set. The results show that the conclusions drawn can be different when outlier 
identification includes consideration of the inefficient frontier. 
To identify bad performers together with slack-based measurement (SBM) Liu and Chen 
[18] propose a worst-practice DEA model called WPF-SBM. Then they develop a HypoSBM 
model to distinguish the worst performers from the bad ones. Finally, a solution approach 
combining WPF-SBM, HypoSBM, and peeling technique is suggested to fully rank the worst 
efficiencies in the worst-case scenario. Their approach is applied in an empirical application 
of the banking industry in Taiwan. The results show that the failed banks could effectively be 
predicted. Therefore, the adequacy of WPF-DEA model for identifying failed bank(s) in the 
worst-case scenario is validated in their study. 
 17 
3. The Proposed Models 
For the purpose of identifying potentially failed corporations in the worse-case scenario, 
we need to develop new DEA models or modify the existing DEA models, even combine 
useful mathematical techniques and managerial concept. The following proposed models are 
of interests. 
 
3.1. The worst-practice frontier CCR (WPF-CCR) model 
In the real world, the companies who have more potential of going out of business are 
usually those of least competitiveness in comparison with others in a scenario which is least 
favorable. WPF-CCR is formulated based on this concept to identify the bad performers in the 
worst-case scenario, in contrast to the BPF-CCR that evaluates DMUo in the most favorable 
scenario. 
All notations remain the same as in the BPF-CCR model. The measure of efficiency also 
assumes the following ratio form:

To see how bad a company’s performance could possibly be in the worst-case scenario, the 
objective is to minimize the measure of efficiency (pessimistically assess the performance). 
One should not intend to minimize the efficiency scores, but is desired to have a set of least 
favorable weights in order to realize the performance in the worst-case scenario. The 
objective value obtained by WPF-CCR is truly a kind of efficiency score. However, since it is 
evaluated in the worst-case scenario, it can be considered as “worst efficiency.” Therefore, in 
WPF-CCR, we call the units on the worst-practice frontier as the “worst efficient” DMUs, and 
the units that do not lie on the frontier are the “pessimistically more efficient” DMUs.

To avoid the assignment of the ε value, model 4 is solved in two phases (Cooper et al. [2]). 
The first phase is to solve the radial ratio, o , as depicted in the following model:

                       (5) 
By the duality theorem of linear programming, the optimal o , denoted by o
 , is equal to 
the optimal objective value of model 3. model 5 has a feasible solution 
* 1o  , 
* 1o  , 
* 1,j j o    , which means DMUo is worst efficient and the reference set only includes itself. 
Hence o
  is not less than 1. The unit with a higher efficiency score is considered 
pessimistically more efficient than the worst efficient unit. 
As the o
  is determined, the second phase is to solve the slack variables, as depicted in 
the following model: 
 21 
In BPF-CCR, C, D, and E are evaluated as efficient DMUs which construct a best-practice 
frontier (the dotted line), and A, B, F, G, and H are less efficient (inefficient) in comparison 
with the efficient DMUs. In WPF-CCR, B, C, and F are evaluated as worst efficient DMUs 
which construct a worst-practice frontier (the solid line), and A, D, E, G, and H are 
pessimistically more efficient relative to the worst efficient DMUs. C locates both on the 
best-practice and worst-practice frontiers, which means C is an efficient DMU evaluated in 
the most favorable scenario, while it is a worst efficient DMU evaluated in the worst-case 
scenario. 
 
3.2. The classification procedure 
In addition to formulating the concept of worse practice in DEA, this study also aims at 
developing classification procedure to clearly identify the worst performers from the bad ones 
and the best performers from the good ones in any case, in order to show the practicality of 
combining WPF-DEA and BPF-DEA. 
When using the BPF-DEA models, we usually identify more than one good performer 
(efficient unit). Similarly, we will get plural bad performers (worst efficient units) when using 
the proposed WPF-CCR model. In the real world, however, there is only a small portion of 
public companies filing for bankruptcy in an average year. For example, there were only three 
banks once on the security list of Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation filed bankruptcy from 
1997 to 2006. The real average bankruptcy ratio of the banking industry in Taiwan is about 
1% in the recent decade. What is really relevant is how to distinguish the worst performer(s) 
(e.g., potentially failed bank(s)) from bad ones (worst efficient DMUs in WPF-DEA) 
effectively and accurately. Thus, further discrimination of the worst efficient units becomes 
more essential. We suggest combining the worst-practice frontier and the peeling technique 
(Paradi [9]). Each layer of peeling in WPF-CCR can classify units as worst efficient and 
 23 
3.3. The worst-practice frontier SBM model 
To evaluate the worst efficiency directly together with the slack values, a slack-based 
measure (SBM) of efficiency (Tone [21]) is taken into account. According to the concept of 
worst-practice frontier, the WPF-SBM model can be developed based on the production 
possibility set of SBM. The production possibility set of WPF-SBM is defined as:

similar way as the CCR model. Let us multiply a scalar variable t (> 0) to both the

3.4. Hypo-efficiency evaluated by WPF-SBM 
In most models of BPF-DEA, the best performers have the “efficient status” denoted by 
unity, and usually plural DMUs have this efficient status. The WPF-SBM models would also 
result in plural DMUs which have the “worst efficient status”. In the real world, however, 
there is only a small portion of the public companies filing for bankruptcy in an average year. 
Discriminating among these worst efficient DMUs becomes an interesting subject. We call 
this problem as the “hypo-efficiency” problem. 
Hypo-efficiency can be considered as the efficiency worse than the worst efficiency. We 
discuss this hypo-efficiency issue based on the SuperSBM model (Tone [22]). We develop the 
HypoSBM model as a method for ranking the worst performers which are identified by using 
WPF-SBM. 
Similarly, we begin with defining a production possibility set P \ ( oo yx  , ) spanned by (X, Y) 
excluding ( oo yx  , ), i.e.

An important extension of the DEA model was developed by Banker, Charnes, and 
Cooper (BCC) [23] as shown in model (18). Their model, unlike the original model, does not 
make the restrictive assumption of constant returns to scale. The property of translated 
invariance for BCC model, which was proved by Ali [24], makes it useful to deal with 
negative data. For instance, if any output index r with negative values in the following 
input-oriented BCC model, all the values in index r, yrj are translated to the new values yrj – pr. 
 31 
Since the o
  obtained as an optimal solution for (19) results in a set of most unfavorable 
weights for DMUo in the sense of minimizing the worst-efficiency ratio scale in an equivalent 
WPF-BCC fractional program model. The equivalent WPF-BCC fractional program obtained 
from (19) is:

Using (20), each DMU is assigned a set of most unfavorable weights. Therefore, 
WPF-BCC model can be considered as evaluating and ranking units in the worst-case (most 
unfavorable) scenario. The efficiency score obtained from the WPF-BCC model are 
considered as the worst efficiency. By virtue of the constraints in (19), the objective value 
WPF BCC
oE
  is not less than 1. If an optimal solution obtained from the WPF-BCC model 
satisfies 1WPF BCCoE
   and is zero-slack, then the DMUo is WPF-BCC worst efficient. The 
worst efficient units construct a worst-practice frontier. 
We now show that for WPF-BCC model, affine displacement (translation) of data does not 
alter the efficient frontier and the classification of DMUs as worst efficient or more efficient is 
invariant to translation. Therefore, we can adequately employ WPF-BCC model with 
translated data from negative profits. This is a very important advantage for empirical study 
since in the real world failed banks or firms often produced negative profit for several years 
before they went into bankruptcy. 
Let the output measures yrj, r = 1, …, s, be displaced by pr, r = 1, …, s. Then the linear 
programming problem for the translated data is given by.

Of the 24 commercial banks, banks 8 and 23 were later taken over by government, which 
is considered as bankrupts. For the purpose of this paper we use the proposed approach to 
investigate how model combination can effectively identify the worst performers as 
potentially failed banks. The results of using the combination of WPF-SBM, HypoSBM, and 
peeling technique are represented in Table 4.

identity the worst performer as potentially failed bank and the best performer(s) as the target 
of investment in advance, we need to study the real data for the year prior to failure happened. 
The financial data for inputs and outputs are the source for measuring their relative 
efficiencies. 
The work of Kao and Liu [26] is the only successful empirical study for predicting 
bankruptcy of Taiwan banks. However, their model can only be applied to interval data which 
comes from financial forecast. The forecasting data are not reliable. Besides, the banks in 
Taiwan are not required to provide financial forecast any more. The only data we can use now 
to predict bank failure is the exact financial data for the year prior to failure happened. In 
order to show that we do not select the inputs and outputs specifically, the choice of inputs 
and outputs in this paper follows the study of Kao and Liu [26]. Three inputs are considered 
in evaluating a bank’s performance: total deposits, interest expenses and non-interest expenses, 
and three outputs are considered: total loans, interest income and non-interest income. The 
financial data of these 29 banks for inputs and outputs are acquired from their financial 
statements of year 2005 as shown in Table 5.

We first use WPF-CCR to identify banks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 17, 18, 21, 23, 26, 28 
and 29 as the worst efficient units as shown (in boldface) in the fifth column of Table 6. These 
worst efficient units are removed from the sample. Then applying the peeling technique in 
WPF-CCR to the remaining banks, banks 3, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 22 and 27 comprise the 
worst efficient units on the second layer as shown (in boldface) in the sixth column of Table 6. 
After applying the peeling technique again, banks 10, 19, 24 and 25 form the last group of 
worst efficient units as shown in the seventh column of Table 6 
Similarly, we can use BPF-CCR in combination with the application of the peeling 
technique to identify the efficient units on the first layer of best-practice frontier are banks 1, 
2, 5, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 26, 27 and 29 as shown (in boldface) in the first column of Table 6. 
The efficient units on the second layer are banks 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 22, 23, 24 and 
25. The efficient units on the last layer are banks 14, 15, 28. 
Now we employ a classification tool based on the business strategy matrix. By placing the 
results on the relative boxes of the business strategy matrix as shown in Table 7, we are able 
 39 
Although the focuses of this study are to identify the worst performers as the potentially 
failed banks and the best performers as the target to invest, one may argue that the boxes 
besides super stars and problem children (as shown in Table 7) are unclear. We would provide 
two principles for using the results on the business strategy matrix. 
Principle 1: The upper the better, the righter the better. 
Principle 2: If you are an aggressive investor, choose the targets from the right-most 
column of the business strategy matrix; if you are a conservative investor, choose the targets 
from the upper-most row of the business strategy matrix.

the business strategy matrix 
Data 
Recently, a case of bank failure happened in Taiwan in the year 2006 after the credit card 
and cash card crisis occurred. Therefore, we decide to collect data from the financial 
statements or annual reports of the banking industry in Taiwan for the purpose of empirical 
study. In order to identity the worst performers as potentially failed banks in advance, we need 
to study the real data for the year prior to failure happened. The financial data that fit for 
inputs, intermediate measures, and outputs are the source for measuring their worst 
efficiencies. 
There were 29 banks (or their holding companies) listed on the security list of Taiwan 
Stock Exchange Corporation in the year 2005. All of them are included in this study, except 
for two banks. The first one is China Development Industrial Bank. This bank is an industrial 
bank and direct investment has been the core business of China Development Industrial Bank. 
The intermediate measure of deposits does not fit the production process of this bank. The 
second one is Taiwan Cooperative Bank Co., Ltd. Under the Taiwan Cooperative Bank

The Results 
For the purpose of identifying the failed bank and comparing the discriminating power of 
the best-practice frontier and worst-practice frontier BCC models, we apply both BCC and 
WPF-BCC model to the data set in two stages. The data on Profits was translated as follows: 
Modified Profits = Profits + 36516, where –36516 is the smallest Profits value in Table 8. The 
efficiency scores of BCC model in two stages and the worst-efficiency scores of WPF-BCC 
model in two stages are presented in Table 9.

We presented the model formulations of WPF-CCR, WPF-SBM, HypoSBM, and 
WPF-BCC based on the concept of worst-practice frontier. The results of the empirical 
applications validate the practical value of these models. We would like to mention that there

Abstract 
 
One may employ Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to discriminate decision-making 
units (DMUs) into efficient and inefficient ones base upon the multiple inputs and output 
performance indices. In this paper we consider that there is a centralized decision maker (DM) 
who ‘owns’ or ‘supervises’ all the DMUs. In such intraorganizational scenario the DM has an 
interest in discriminating the efficient DMUs (eDMUs). This paper presents a new method 
that determines the most compromising set of weights for the indices’. The total of the new 
efficiency scores of eDMUs with the most compromising set of indices’ weights has the least 
total gaps to the compromised datum. The eDMUs that have efficiency score equal to one are 
located on the datum. The other eDMUs are either located above or below the datum. The 
approach is analog to the ordinary least-square method (OLS) of the residuals in statistical 
regression analysis. We compare the results of an example with multiple inputs and single 
output under the proposed approach and regression analysis.

could be above, equal, or below the datum. The total of gaps of the implicit efficiencies to the 
datum has been minimized. We review the related literature such as: multiple regression 
analysis, data envelopment analysis, common weight analysis, and super-common weight 
analysis in the second section. In the third section, we develop the most compromising 
weights analysis (MCWA) model. Then, the MCWA ranking rules are explained. At the same 
time, the Two-Phase method is introduced to deal with the problem of possible alternative 
solutions in the linear programming. In the fourth section, we compare the results of an 
example with multiple inputs and single output under the proposed approach, regression 
analysis, CWA and SCWA. Finally, the conclusion and future development opportunities are 
suggested in the last paragraph.

The following equation is the expression of multiple linear regression without intercept 
model for m independent variables (indices) X1, X2,…, Xm to a dependent variable (index) Y 
for DMUj

The 1β , 2β , …, mβ  are called regression coefficients and  is called the residual or error 
term of the DMU

ε is a very small positive coefficient to insure the fractional equation could be converted 
to linear equation by multiplication. 
Liu & Peng (2004b) introduce Super Common Weight Analysis (SCWA) that determines 
a common set of indices’ weights. It is assumed all the eDMUs are equally weighted for 
determining the common set of weights. The implicit efficiencies’ datum is set to one. 
Employing the common set of weights, eDMUs’ implicit efficiencies could be equal one or 
more than one. The sum of the implicit efficiencies is the minimum, or the total of the gaps to 
datum is minimized.

3. Our methodology 
3.1 The Most Compromising Set of Indices’ Weights Analysis (MCWA) 
This paper presents a method that determines the most compromising set of indices’ 
weights. It is assumed all the eDMUs are equally weighted for the determination. The datum 
of implicit efficiency is set to one. Employing the set of weights, eDMUs’ implicit 
efficiencies could be above, equal, or below the datum. The total of the gaps to the datum is 
minimized. 
The approach is analog to the ordinary least-square method (OLS) of the residuals in 
statistical regression analysis.

Model (P4) is formulated to search an optimal datum line that would result a minimum 
total gaps of the n DMUs. The optimal solution (Vi* , i=1,...,m; Ur*, r=1,...,s) is the most 
compromised weights.

Here, capital letter Vi and Ur denote the most compromising weights of the i-th input and the

models. ε is still a positive Archimedean infinitesimal constant; we do this to avoid a case of 
zero value of indices obtained by choosing the set of zero weights. E denotes the set that 
composed by all the eDMUs. If  and  are unequally weighted, the right-hand-side of 
the equality constraint is subject to altered. We translate the above model (P4) to the

Analyzing model (P9), we observe that the setting of parameter ε can be any arbitrary positive 
number. In other words, we will obtain the equivalent results no matter what the value of 
parameter ε is. It is convenient to set the parameter ε = 1. Furthermore, we can take advantage 
of (P9) to make some appropriate illustrations about the improvement of low-ranking DMUs. 
Pr and Qi are separately the total difference of all DMUs to the datum line corresponding in 
the r-th output and the i-th input. Furthermore, Pr and Qi can be partitioned as Pr = ∑(j ∈ E) prj 
and Qi = ∑(j ∈ E) qij in (P10). prj and qij are the difference of DMUj in r-th the output and i-th 
input, respectively, to the datum line.

3.2 Ranking Rules of MCWA 
In this section, we introduce the MCWA ranking rules. First, the MCWA-efficiency score 
of DMUj is defined as the following equation.

Before defining the ranking, we first distinguish the DMUs as three separate groups. 
 
【Definition 1】 
DMUj locates on the datum line iff = 0 or ** −+ Δ+Δ jj *Mjθ  = 1. And DMUj locates above the 
datum line iff *Mjθ  > 1. Otherwise, DMUj locates below the datum line. 
It is necessary to establish this rule in order to distinguish DMUs. We can finish the ranking 
by the following principles. 
 
【Definition 2】 
The performance of DMUj1 is better than DMUj2 iff the efficiency score  > . *1

It is not necessary to presume the imaginary goal as our datum line. In fact, we can take the 
DMU which locates on the datum line as the standard. Therefore, we have to ensure that there 
is at least one DMU locates on the datum line. 
 
【Theorem 2】 
There is at least one DMU locates on the datum line. 
Proof: It is claimed that we get the optimal criteria value with variables common weight

In this case, πj* means the impact to total gaps resulted by that the j-th MCWA-datum DMUs 
desire to raise its efficiency. Therefore we can obtain the different changed values from each 
MCWA-datum DMUs. By the way, if we have multiple MCWA-datum DMUs, πj* will appeal 
the good information which one has the most influence on the total gaps to assess them. By 
the above definitions, the eDMUs could be ranked. 
 
3.3 Application of MCWA：Two-Phased Method 
(P7) usually results alternative solutions. The alternative sets of index weights lead to 
different ranking. In order to select a set of appropriate unique set of weights, the two-phased 
method is necessary.

Employ BCC-DEA model, these five DMUs are BCC-efficient. According to MCWA, 
DMUE’s efficiency is equal to 1. In the following table, one observes that DMUE is the datum. 
The set of the most compromising weights is strongly affected by the DMUs with large scale. 
But they are not guaranteed to be a datum. 
The ranks of other DMUs are listed in the following table. Furthermore, the differences 
of each DMU to the datum line to its reference in all indices are listed. Therefore, we have to 
note that the DMU ranked first is not sure the best reference of all DMUs.

 5. CONCLUSION 
 
This paper proposes a model to discriminate the efficient DMUs in DEA models. This 
new ranking method based on the DEA framework helps the decision maker (DM) in the task 
of assessment. We provide the ranking rule as a convenient guide for DM to judge which 
DMU the best is. In the cases of identical individual performance, we rank the contributions 
of each DMU to the total gaps. Simultaneously, we provide the difference of each input and 
output index to the datum line for the DMUs not on the datum line. 
There are a number of future research issues that remain to be addressed. One of them is 
that how to extend the full ranking to the DEA-iDMUs. There is no guarantee that MCWA 
will result in eDMUs earning good ranking, simply because MCWA is not emphasized in the 
individual performance. Hence, there remains the critical issue of how to further balance both

single buffer space are not suggested. This paper thus introduces an unprecedented approach for 
simulation output analysis to select material handling system designs. 
Section 2 of this paper contains the literature review of simulation output analysis on material 
handling system design and DEA models. Section 3 describes the material handling system under 
design. The collected simulation output of a design alternative is also depicted. In the fourth section, 
we introduce the assessment DEA model that we developed. Likewise, we depict the assessment 
results for the 180 design alternatives, and show the statistical hypothesis tests for the assessment 
results. Finally, the paper’s conclusions are listed in the last section. 
2 Literature Review 
The three categories literatures related to this research are reviewed here. 
2.1 Simulation Outputs Analysis of Material Handling Systems 
Liu and Hung (2001) proposed three deadlock-free control strategies for a single multi-load automated guided vehicle. 
The results of performance indices were expressed through its mean values. The superior strategy can be found by 
comparing the values of the performance indices. If the performance value of the strategy outperforms the others, then it 
can be interpreted to mean that the strategy dominates the other strategies. In addition, each strategy was discussed 
individually in each condition. Based on the simulation experiments, it seemed that we could not find the standard to 
evaluate the strategies. 
Lin, Wang, and Yang (2005) used the least significant difference (LSD) method to compare the 
strategies under each condition. The paired test analysis was used to rank the significant difference 
of the strategies. The means of each of the performance values were collected in repeated runs. This 
would provide some guidance for decision makers in the selection of preferable strategies on the 
basis of the different operation, environment, and performance measures. The preferable strategies 
can be observed by comparing the performance value of each condition. 
2.2 Original DEA Models 
The DEA model was first introduced by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978). It is generally referred to as a CCR 
model. This model evaluates the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) based on linear programming 
while at the same time considering the multiple inputs and outputs. DEA deals with the ratio of weighted sum of 
outputs to weighted sum of inputs. The optimal objective value (θ
＊
) is called the ratio efficiency of the DMU. The 
excess in inputs and shortfalls in outputs are revealed by the optimal solution called slacks. A DMU with the full ratio 
efficiency, θ
＊
=1, and with no slacks in any optimal solution is called CCR-efficient. The DMUs on the DEA frontier are 
relatively more efficient than other DMUs with maximum output levels given input levels, or with minimum input 
levels given output levels. As such, the efficient DMUs are the references of inefficient DMUs. 
Tone (2001) proposed a slacks-based measure (SBM) of efficiency based on input excesses and 
output shortfalls. Each DMU can be improved and become more efficient by deleting the input 
excess and augmenting the output shortfalls. The SBM model can be interpreted as a product of 
objectives as well as to avoid shop deadlocks caused by inappropriate job movement. Moreover, 
this satisfies the system transport requirement.

There are 12 combinations of P/T ratio and arrival rate , namely, k= 1, 2, …, 12. Each of the 
combination has 15 combinations of queue capacity C and control strategies S. Therefore, there are 
180 combinations (design alternatives) of the four design parameters. The simulation experiments 
for the material handling system are shown in Table 1.

We developed a simulation model for each of the 180 design alternatives. Each simulation model 
was run for 24 hours. To eliminate the initial transit bias, the output during the first two hours was 
discarded in all of the runs. In each simulation run, the maximum and minimum values for the 
above five performance indices, PI1, PI2, PI3, PI4, and PI5, were recorded. 
The next table depicts the simulation results of the 15 design alternatives with P/T ratio=6 and 
arrival rate =10, k=1. The first row signifies the five performance indices, PI1, PI2, PI3, PI4, and PI5, 
and the two design factors S and C. To convert the notations used for material handling system 
design problems to the notations used in the literature of DEA models, the seven notations were 
renamed as X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, Y1, and Y2, respectively. The fourth row illustrates the notations of the 
upper bound and lower bound values of the seven DEA indices. 
As indicated by Sarrico and Dyson (2004), the expressions DMU and decision maker could be 
misleading. The material handling system designer as the decision maker is, in fact, at a different

Generally, a good system design shall yield low riding time X1, low machine blockage frequency X2, 
low machine blockage duration X3, high throughput Y1, and high machine utilization Y2. We use the 
following equation to calculate the aggregate performance score θj for each design alternative if the 
associated indices weights v
i
 and u
r
 are determined. x
ij
 and y
rj
 respectively denote the values of 
UOAj falling between its upper and lower bounds, (
L
ij
U
ij xx , ) and (
L
rj
U
rj yy , ). The counter j is formed 
by two tuples (q, k) where q and k range from 1 to 15 and 1 to 12, respectively. In total, 180 design 
alternatives were simulated. 
4.2 Interval-SBM Model 
The redial efficiency score θo
*
 obtained in [P2] excludes the portion of slack values. θo
*
 tends to overestimate the true 
efficiency score. The objective function of [P3] was substituted for the objective function of [P2] in order to compute 
the slack-based measurement (SBM) efficiency score. All the inefficiencies are expressed in a slack form. The score ρo
*
 
obtained in [P3] would not be greater than θo
*
. The theory of SBM is well introduced in Tone (2001).

[P3] can be transformed into a linear program using the Charnes-Cooper transformation in a similar 
way as the CCR model (Charnes et al., 1978). 
First, let us multiply a scalar variable t (>0) for both the denominator and the numerator in the 
objective function of [P3]. This causes no change in ρo. Second, we adjust t so that the denominator 
becomes 1. Then this term is moved to constraints.  The objective is to minimize the numerator. 
Third, because the present model is a nonlinear programming problem ( rts
 ), we transform it into a

The dual variables 
iv  and ru  can be interpreted as the virtual cost and price of the i
th
 input and the 
r
th
 output, respectively. For UOAj, the dual variables qij and prj are interpreted as the virtual costs iv  
multiplied by the weights of input interval and prices 
ru , then multiplied by the weights of output 
interval, respectively. The goal of this dual model is to find the optimal virtual costs and prices for 
Difference Test (Montgomery, 2001) for the five levels of C in Table 5. The procedure uses the F 
statistic for testing each pair of levels, i and j, with the hypothesis that their means are equal, Ho: 
i=j. Clearly, the only pairs of means C =3, C =4, and C =5 do not differ significantly. C=1 and 
C=2 produces a significantly low *o than the other levels of C. 
Because C*S has a highly significant impact on *o , we likewise further perform a Fisher Least 
Significant Difference Test (Montgomery, 2001) for the 15 combinations of C*S in Table 3. For the 
results depicted in Table 6, Combination No. 1 produces a significantly lower mean efficiency than 
the other combinations. The next group containing Combinations No. 2 and No. 6 has a higher 
mean efficiency than Combination No. 1, but they do not differ significantly from each another. The 
third group contains Combinations No. 3, No. 4, and No. 11, and the remaining combinations 
belong to the fourth group. The third group has a higher mean efficiency than the second group, and 
the forth group has a higher mean efficiency than the third group. However, it does not differ 
significantly within groups. 
The simulation output analysis results show that setting the buffer capacity for the incoming and 
outgoing job at 5 outperforms the others. All in all, the higher the buffer capacity C, the higher the 
performance value. The control strategy S and mean job arrival rate  are not the factors of change 
in the DEA performance measure *o .
