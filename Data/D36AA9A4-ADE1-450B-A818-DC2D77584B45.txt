二、研究目的與文獻探討 
It is well known that there are a lot of 
typhoons in the summer season in Taiwan and 
they usually cause severe damages in the 
coastal regions. When engineers want to design 
structures in coastal or offshore areas, the 
significant wave heights induced by typhoons 
are very much required. However, such 
information is usually not available or too 
expensive. As a result, numerical simulations 
should be performed to circumvent this 
difficult and have become popular tools in 
practical engineering applications. 
The WAM (WAve Model) and SWAN 
(Simulating WAve Nearshore) are third 
generation wave models used to compute wave 
spectra in coastal waters. The WAM code has 
been primarily developed by the WAMDI 
Group (1988) to generate wave predictions in 
oceanic deep waters, whereas the SWAN code 
has been developed by Booij et al. (1999) and 
can be used in coastal shallow waters. The 
WAM is applicable for deep water ocean 
waves which are mainly wind-driven, while the 
SWAN is suitable to present nearshore wave 
propagation processes such as shoaling, 
refraction, and wave breaking due to finite 
depth effect. In addition, the quadruplet 
wave–wave interactions which dominate the 
wave spectrum evolution in deep water are 
used for the WAM model, whereas the triad 
wave–wave interactions which are important in 
shallow water are used for the SWAN model. 
To connect the calculations between deep 
and shallow waters, Holthuijsen et al. (2000) 
coupled the WAM and the SWAN simulation 
by dividing the entire domain into some 
sub-regions with varying spatial grid sizes 
according to the desired resolution. A 
WAM/SWAN interface is also specified to 
allow the stationary boundary conditions for a 
fine-nest SWAN simulation provided by a 
coarse-nest WAM simulation. Wornom et al. 
(2001) simulated the wind–wave activities for 
the 1995 Hurricane Luis and the coupled model 
performed well. 
However, the exclusive usages of the 
finite difference method (FDM) in these 
models do not take the advantages of recent 
computing science since the FDM cannot be 
easily implemented for irregular coastal lines as 
well as for the connections between fine and 
coast meshes. Hsu et al. (2005) significantly 
circumvented this difficult by using the finite 
element method (FEM) in the computing of 
wave spectra in spatial coordinates. Their 
model was named as the WWM (Wind Wave 
Model). The FEM has advantages to display 
accurately for complicated bathymetry and 
irregular boundaries. It can also solve the 
combined large-scale oceanic and small-scale 
coastal waves in the same discrete domain by 
using the unstructured meshes, which are 
constructed by triangular elements of varying 
sizes. This feature allows the flexibility to have 
a coarse mesh on a large-scale area and a fine 
mesh on a small-scale area. In Hsu’s study, 
they have simulated the wind wave activities 
for the 2000 Typhoon Bilis by the WWM and 
compared the simulated results with the results 
of the SWAN and the field observations. 
On the other hand in recent years the 
meshless or mesh-free methods have received a 
considerable attention since they can save time 
for mesh generation when compared with the 
classical mesh-dependent numerical methods, 
such as the FDM, the FEM and the boundary 
element method (BEM). Roughly speaking, the 
meshless or mesh-free methods can be divided 
into two categories. The first one is 
domain-type methods in which both the 
differential equations and boundary conditions 
are approximated, such as the Kansa’s method 
(or multiquadrics (MQ) method) [Kansa 
(1990A, 1990B), Li, Cheng, and Chen (2003)] 
as well as the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin 
method (MLPG) [Wordelman, Aluru, and 
Ravaioli (2000), Lin and Atluri (2000), Kim 
and Atluri (2000)]. The second one is 
boundary-type methods where only boundary 
conditions are collocated, such as the method 
of fundamental solutions (MFS) [Kupradze and 
Aleksidze (1964), Mathon and Johnston (1977),

Fictitious Time Integration Method of Fundamental
Solutions with Chebyshev Polynomials for Solving
Poisson-type Nonlinear PDEs
Chia-Cheng Tsai1, Chein-Shan Liu2 and Wei-Chung Yeih3
Abstract: The fictitious time integration method (FTIM) previously developed
by Liu and Atluri (2008a) is combined with the method of fundamental solu-
tions and the Chebyshev polynomials to solve Poisson-type nonlinear PDEs. The
method of fundamental solutions with Chebyshev polynomials (MFS-CP) is an
exponentially-convergent meshless numerical method which is able to solving non-
homogeneous partial differential equations if the fundamental solution and the an-
alytical particular solutions of the considered operator are known. In this study, the
MFS-CP is extended to solve Poisson-type nonlinear PDEs by using the FTIM. In
the solution procedure, the FTIM is introduced to convert a Poisson-type nonlin-
ear PDE into a sequence of linear nonhomogeneous modified Helmholtz equations
which are then formally solved by the MFS-CP. Several numerical experiments
were carried out to validate the proposed methods.
Keywords: Fictitious time integration method, Method of fundamental solutions,

1 Introduction
Based on the Lie-group shooting method (Liu 2006, 2008a), the fictitious time
integration method (FTIM) was invented by Liu and Atluri (2008a) to solve cou-
pled nonlinear algebraic equations. In the solution procedure, a fictitious time is
introduced to convert the original nonlinear algebraic equations into evolutionary
ordinary differential equations. The fixed point of the evolutionary system, which
is also the root of the original algebraic equations, is then obtained by applying nu-
merical integrations on the resultant ordinary differential equations, which do not

2009a, 2009b)] and the Trefftz method [Liu (2007a, 2007b, 2008e); Cozzano and
Rodríguez (2007); Lee and Chen (2009); Li, Lu, Huang and Cheng (2009)]. In this
paper, we are going to use the MFS to solve modified Helmholtz equations which
are resulted from the Poisson-type nonlinear PDEs by using the FTIM.
The method of particular solution (MPS), invented by Golberg and Chen (1999),
is needed in order to apply the MFS for solving nonhomogeneous PDEs since the
MFS generally requires the governing equation to be homogeneous. Actually, the
MPS is equivalent to the dual reciprocity method (DRM) invented by Nardini and
Brebbia (1982). In the applications of the MPS, it is desired to have the analyti-
cal particular solutions associated to the basis functions and the considered partial
differential operator. When the Chebyshev polynomials are adopted as the basis
function, analytical particular solutions of the modified Helmholtz operator can be
found in the literature [Golberg, Muleshkov, Chen, and Cheng (2003); Reutskiy
and Chen (2006); Karageorghis, and Kyza (2007); Ding and Chen (2007); Tsai
(2008); Tsai (2009)]. Overall, the method of fundamental solutions with Cheby-
shev polynomials (MFS-CP) is a well-developed exponentially-convergent mesh-
less numerical method which is able to solve nonhomogeneous modified Helmholtz
equations.
In this study, we combine the FTIM and MFS-CP as the FTIMFS-CP to solve the
Poisson-type nonlinear PDEs. Numerical experiments in two- and three-dimensional
domains are carried out to validate the proposed numerical scheme. Numerical re-
sults demonstrate the accuracy of the method. In addition, the meshless feature
makes the proposed method easy to be applied in complex computational domains.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the Poisson-type nonlinear PDE is
introduced and the FTIM is applied to convert it into a sequence of linear nonho-
mogeneous modified Helmholtz equations. In Section 3, the MFS-CP formulation
is introduced to solve the nonhomogeneous modified Helmholtz equations. Numer-
ical experiments are presented in Section 4 and some conclusions are drawn in the
last section.
2 Poisson-type nonlinear PDE and FTIM formulation
In this study, we consider the following Poisson-type nonlinear boundary value
problem:
−∇2u(x,y,z) = G(x,y,z,u,ux,uy,uz) x,y,z ∈Ω (1)

Using Eq. (4), Eq. (9) can also be rewritten as
∂u
∂ t
− 1
q
∇2u =

q
G(x,y,z,u,ux,uy,uz) (11)
In this study, we typically select the following time-like function:
q(t) = (1+ t)M (12)
where M is a parameter to arrange the convergence of the FTIM as was done in Ku,
Yeih, Liu and Chi (2009). Eq. (11) is just the evolutionary equation to be solved. In
the solution procedure, the boundary condition in Eq. (2) should also be imposed
and an initial condition should be set up.
2.2 Euler scheme
We may employ a forward Euler scheme to integrate Eq. (11), which results in
[Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling and Flannery (2007)]:
∇2uI+1− q
I+1
∆t
uI+1 =− q
I
∆t
uI−G(x,y,z,uI,uIx,uIy,uIz) I = 0,1,2, ... (13)
which is a sequence of linear nonhomogeneous modified Helmholtz equations to be
solved. In addition to the governing equation in Eq. (13) we also need the following
boundary condition
BuI+1 (x,y,z) = H (x,y,z) I = 0,1,2, ... (14)
The numerical procedure starts from an initial value of u0 (x,y,z) which can be
arbitrarily chosen. Then, the FTIM integrates Eq. (13) from t= 0 to a selected final

Note that l, m and n are the numbers of Gauss-Lobatto nodes in the x, y and z
directions, respectively. And the cube should be big enough to enclose the compu-
tational domain. For two dimensions, it is depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, it is
well known that the use of Gauss-Lobatto nodes ensure the spectral convergence
for Chebyshev interpolation. Details of Chebyshev interpolation can be found in a
recent excellent review book of Mason and Handscomb (2003).

boundary field points to avoid the singularity as shown in Fig. 2. By collocating
Eq. (27) on N boundary field points xi, a linear square matrix system can be found
and the N unknowns Ai can be solved by numerical methods. This MFS procedure
is quite formal, more details can be found in the literature [Kupradze and Alek-
sidze (1964); Mathon and Johnston (1977); Bogomolny (1985), Smyrlis and Kara-
georghis (2001); Tsai, Young and Cheng (2002); Smyrlis and Karageorghis (2004);

After we have both the homogeneous and particular solution, we can proceed to
next time step until the criterion in Eq. (15) be satisfied. These finish the develop-
ment of FTIMFS-CP formulation.
4 Numerical experiments
Now we are ready to perform some numerical examples. The four numerical exper-
iments in Ku, Yeih, Liu and Chi (2009) are first carried out to validate the proposed
FTIMFS-CP. Then the method is extended to a peanut-shaped domain to demon-
strate the flexibility of the present meshless method. In these numerical experi-
ments, the root mean square error (RMSE) is defined by√√√√√ L∑j=1(uNUM (x j)−uANA (x j))2

Fictitious Time Integration Method 147
5 Conclusions
In this study, the fictitious time integration method was combined with the method
of fundamental solution with Chebyshev polynomials to form a meshless numer-
ical method to solve the Poisson-type nonlinear PDEs. In the solution procedure,
a Poisson-type nonlinear PDE is first converted into a sequence of linear inho-
mogenous modified Helmholtz equations by the FTIM and then be formally solved
by the MFS-CP. Several numerical experiments were carried to validate the pro-
posed numerical method and accurate numerical solutions were found. Further-
more, a Poisson-type nonlinear PDE was computed in a peanut-shaped domain
which demonstrated the flexibility of the present meshless numerical method to
complex geometry.
