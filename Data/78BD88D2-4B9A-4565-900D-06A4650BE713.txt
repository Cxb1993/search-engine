switched from (200) to (111) as thickness increased 
from 281 to 624 nm and above. The hardness of the 
nanocomposite can be associated with the texture of 
TiN phase and compositions. The residual stress 
results indicated that the amorphous SiNx in the 
TiN/SiNx nanocomposite could significantly relieve 
the average residual stress ranging from 19 to 68% 
with increasing film thickness, which may be the 
reason that the thickness of nanocomposite could 
reach 2 um. Critical stress for the film delamination 
was estimated, which was found to be decreased with 
increasing film thickness. In the second year, TiSiN 
coatings with different thickness were deposited on 
D2 tool steel substrates. The purpose of this 
research was to investigate the influence of coating 
thickness on the compositions, structure, mechanical 
properties, and corrosion resistance of TiSiN 
coatings.  The effect of Ti interlayer on structure 
and properties of TiSiN coatings was also studied.  
The coating thickness ranging from 696 to 3019 nm and 
the maximum thickness could reach over 3 um.  TiN 
(111) was the preferred orientation in all TiSiN 
coatings.  The incorporation of Si or addition of Ti 
interlayer could change the preferred orientation of 
TiN phase from (200) to (111) in the TiSiN coatings.  
The results of XRD and XPS revealed that the 
nanocomposite coatings were composed of 
nanocrystalline TiN and amorphous SiNx.  The 
hardness, ranging from 23 to 36 GPa, was related to 
the grain size and texture of TiN in TiSiN coatings.  
The residual stresses of TiN in nanocomposite 
coatings measured by XRD cos2αsin2ψ method were all 
compressive and had no significant variation with 
increasing coating thickness.  The results of the 
potentiodynamic polarization scan indicated that the 
TiSiN-coated samples possessed good corrosion 
resistance in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 5 wt% NaCl 
solutions.  From the results of scratch test and 
potentiodynamic polarization scan, the addition of Ti 
interlayer was beneficial for the adhesion strength 
and corrosion resistance of the TiSiN coatings.

Abstract 
Ti-Si-N films were deposited on P-type Si(100) wafers using unbalanced magnetron 
sputtering (UBMS) at different deposition durations.  The purposes of this study were to 
investigate the mechanical properties of Ti-Si-N films, especially the hardness and residual 
stress at different thickness, and to prepare Ti-Si-N films with high hardness and large 
thickness suitable for industrial applications.  The film thickness increased with deposition 
time ranging from 281 to 2044 nm.  Nanocomposite coating with a good combination of 
hardness and thickness was obtained, where the hardness was 37 GPa with a thickness of 2 
m.  The preferred orientation of TiN phase in the TiN/SiNx nanocomposite films switched 
from (200) to (111) as thickness increased from 281 to 624 nm and above.  The hardness of 
the nanocomposite can be associated with the texture of TiN phase and compositions.  Laser 
curvature method and modified XRD sin2ψ method were used to measure the average 
residual stress and stress of TiN phase in the nanocomposite, respectively.  The results 
indicated that the amorphous SiNx in the TiN/SiNx nanocomposite could significantly relieve 
the average residual stress ranging from 19 to 68% with increasing film thickness, which may 
be the reason that the thickness of nanocomposite could reach 2 m.  Critical stress for the 
film delamination was estimated, which was found to be decreased with increasing film 
thickness.  The film started to delaminate as the residual stress reached critical stress.

1. Introduction 
The demands of high performance functional coatings have been increasing in tool 
industry for the last decade.  Superhard nanocomposite coatings clearly show their potential 
in response to the high performance requirements in the related areas [1-3].  There have 
been many available superhard nanocomposites applied on machining, stamping and 
forming tools, which significantly increase the lifetime of the tools and the cutting speed, 
and consequently enhancing the overall productivity [4].  Superhard coatings are usually 
multi-component compounds containing additional metal and metalloid components.  
Among the new superhard coatings, TiN/Si3N4 proposed and developed by Veprek et al. [5] 
is one of the most popular coating materials.  Due to the superior hardness and high 
oxidation resistance, the TiN/Si3N4 nanocomposite coatings have very high commercial 
potential to be applied as protective coatings in tool industry [3,6].  
Another possible application of TiN/Si3N4 nanocomposite may be in the electronic 
device such as nonvolatile memory.  In recent years, the hybrid nonvolatile memory 
producing by nanocrystalline Si embedded in Si3N4 shows higher operation speed than 
SONOS memory [7].  The nanostructure with TiN nanocrystals embedded in Al2O3 was 
reported to be able to improve the memory effect [8].  Since Si3N4 can provide more 
trapping sites than that of Al2O3, the nanostructure with TiN nanocrystals embedded in Si3N4 
is expected to have much better memory performance.  Recently, Wu et al. [9] reported that 
TiN/Si3N4 nanocomposite deposited by magnetron sputtering demonstrated good memory 
performance with low voltage operation.  Therefore, TiN/Si3N4 nanocomposite may extend 
4 
 
studies have reported on TiN/Si3N4 nanocomposites possessing both high hardness and large 
thickness.  Normally, a superhard coating cannot reach a very large thickness, which is 
commonly believed to be due to high residual stress in the coatings.  To produce an 
applicable coating, it is necessary to understand the role of residual stress in the 
nanocomposite.  The purposes of this study were to investigate the mechanical properties of 
Ti-Si-N films with different thickness, especially the hardness and residual stress, and to 
prepare Ti-Si-N films with high hardness and large thickness.  In this study, the 
nanocomposite Ti-Si-N films were deposited using unbalanced magnetron sputtering and the 
deposition duration was selected to be the controlling parameter. 
 
2. Experimental Procedures 
TiN thin film and TiN/SiNx nanocomposites were deposited using a dc unbalanced 
magnetron sputtering system.  The substrate material was 4-inch P-type Si (100) wafer with 
a thickness of 0.525 mm.  Prior to deposition, the Si substrate was ultrasonically cleaned 
progressively in acetone and methanol solutions, each for 5 minutes.  Then the substrate 
was blown dried by N2 gas and immediately placed into the deposition chamber.  
The deposition chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 2.7 × 10-4 Pa (2 × 10-6 Torr) 
for preventing contamination during deposition process.  The substrate temperature was 
maintained at 450C, which was controlled by placing a thermocouple close to the heater, 
and the substrate temperature was calibrated by another thermocouple attaching on the 
specimen.  Before deposition, the substrate was pre-sputtered by Ar ions for 5 min at an Ar 
(99.9995% in purity) flow rate of 50 sccm and a substrate bias of -1000 V to remove the 
surface oxide layer.  
The deposition of TiN/SiNx thin films was carried out by co-sputtering of Ti and Si 
targets, where the Ti target current was 0.45 A, and the Si target power was 40W.  The 
substrate to target distance was 10 cm.  A negative bias of 80V was applied onto the Si 
substrate which was rotated at a speed of 18 rpm during deposition.  The flow rates of 
nitrogen were 2 sccm and 4.5 sccm for the deposition of TiN and TiN/SiNx, respectively, and 
the flow rate of Ar was 45 sccm.  The working pressure was 2×10-1 Pa (1.5×10-3 Torr).  
The deposition durations was ranged from 30 to 210 min with a 30-min interval.  The 
designation of the specimen is listed in Table 1.   
The chemical compositions of the thin films were measured with a PHI 1600 X-ray 
photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) using Mg Kα X-ray (1253.6 eV).  The specimen was 
pre-sputtered by 3 keV Ar ion for 3 min to eliminate the surface contamination.  The C 1s 
peak from the adventitious carbon-based contaminant, with respect to the literature value of 
284.6eV, was used as the reference for the calibration of the XPS spectra to eliminate the 
charging effect.  The XPS data was analyzed using a computer program XPSEAK 4.1. The 
background of the spectra was subtracted using the Shirley’s method [23] and then each 
corresponding peak was deconvoluted and fitted using Gaussian function.  The atomic 
percentage of each element in the TiN and TiN/SiNx films was calculated from the integrated 
intensities of the related peaks calibrated by the relative sensitivity factors.  The relative 
contents of Ti, N, O and Si were calculated by the following equation 
100%ii
Ti N O Si
IC
I I I I
     
where i represents Ti, N, O, or Si. Ci is the content of the element i in the thin film and I 
stands for the integrated intensity of the fitted peak.  
The atomic compositions of the samples were also measured by Rutherford 
Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS).  α (4He+) particle with an energy of 2 MeV was used 
as the incident ion species.  The spectra of RBS were fitted using the RUMP simulation 
program [24].  Due to the close atomic numbers of nitrogen and oxygen, the N/O ratio is 
6 
 
The compositions determined from XPS are listed in Table 1.  From Table 1, the 
compositions of specimens S2 to S5 are quite close to each other.  For the specimen S1, the 
higher oxygen content could be due to the surface adsorbed oxygen atoms derived from 
outgassing, which was not effectively eliminated by Ar ion bombardment during deposition 
in a relative shorter deposition time. 
Since the energy spectrum of backscattered Ti ion overlaps with that of the Si substrate 
and the two spectra are difficult to be separated, the RBS analysis has a maximum in-depth 
detecting limit at approximately 1 m.  As a result, for those specimens with thickness 
more than 1 m, sample S3, S4 and S5, the compositions by RBS were unattainable. 
Moreover, due to the close atomic number of N (7) and O (8), the spectrum of nitrogen is 
almost overlapped with that of oxygen, which leads to the difficulty in resolving the 
individual element ratio, and thus the RBS data can only provide the information of 
(N+O)/Ti ratio, as listed in Table 1.  It can be seen that the (N+O)/Ti ratios of samples S1, 
S2 and TiN obtained from XPS and RBS are fairly consistent. 
The microstructure of the TiN and TiN/SiNx films was observed using SEM and the 
cross-sectional images are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively.  Fig. 1(a) depicts that 
the TiN film possesses a typical columnar structure.  Fig. 1(b) shows a representative SEM 
image of the TiN/SiNx films.  Compared with TiN film, the TiN/SiNx film presents a 
different microstructure that contains a very fine columnar structure on top of a layer with 
indistinctive fine structure.  The thicknesses of the films determined from the SEM images 
are tabulated in Table 1.  The thickness of sample S5 is larger than 2 m. 
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns for the TiN and TiN/SiNx films deposited at five different 
durations ranging from 0.5 h to 3.5 h, where (111) and (200) diffraction peaks of TiN phase 
appeared in all specimens.  The TiN (111) texture coefficient of all samples are listed in 
Table 1.  The results of XRD indicate that the preferred orientation of TiN in TiN/SiNx 
films is significantly changed with increasing film thickness.  The single-phase TiN 
specimen shows a strong (200) preferred orientation.  For the TiN/SiNx specimens, sample 
S1 displays a (200) preferred orientation; as the deposition time increases, the preferred 
orientation of sample S2 switches to (111) and the texture continues to be prevailed for the 
samples S3 to S5, but (200) peak still exists with lower intensity in those samples.  The 
XRD patterns for both TiN/SiNx and single-phase SiNx films show no diffraction peaks for 
SiNx, indicating SiNx is amorphous.  The grain size of TiN, ranging from 18 to 39 nm, was 
determined from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the TiN (111) peak using 
Scherrer equation, as listed in Table 1. 
Fig. 3 shows the GIXRD patterns for TiN and all TiN/SiNx films, in which four major 
TiN orientations, namely (111), (200), (220), and (311) are revealed.  Compared the spectra 
of TiN/SiNx with that of single-phase TiN, it can be found that the TiN peaks of TiN/SiNx are 
not as sharp as the corresponding peaks of the single-phase TiN sample.  The GIXRD 
patterns were used to calculate the lattice parameters of the samples and the data are listed in 
Table 1.   
The representative compositional depth profiles from AES are depicted in Fig. 4.  
Since Ti and N cannot be properly separated by AES, the depth profiles can only show the 
distribution of each element.  Fig. 4(a) shows the depth profiles of sample S1, where each 
element distributes uniformly through the film thickness except oxygen.  There is an 
oxygen accumulation starting from about 150 nm from the film/substrate interface where the 
oxygen content increases while Ti+N decreases gradually and there is no apparent variation 
in the content of titanium.  The typical depth profiles of other samples S2 to S5 are shown 
in Fig. 4(b).  Similar to sample S1, Ti, N and Si are uniformly distributed through thickness 
and oxygen accumulates within a distance of about 200 nm ahead of the film/substrate 
interface. 
8 
 
than 1 nm, the film hardness substantially decreases to about 35 GPa.  Our previous study 
indicated that for TiN thin film with a crystal size less than 20 nm, the deformation 
mechanism may change from dislocation slip to grain rotation or grain boundary sliding [30]. 
We also found that the hardness of a nanocrystalline TiN thin film does not vary significantly 
with changing texture, which was attributed to the occurrence of grain boundary mediated 
deformation mechanism [31].  Therefore, for the TiSiN nanocomposite with a TiN grain 
size less than 20 nm, the alternative grain boundary-mediated mechanism may become the 
major deformation mechanism.  In that case, the hardness of the nanocomposite is mainly 
from the strength of the grain boundary which controls the difficulty of grain rotation or 
grain boundary sliding.   
According to recent theoretical studies by Zhang et al. [32,33], the shear strength of the 
interface can reach theoretical value in the existence of monolayer SiNx interface.  By 
adding a monolayer of SiNx in TiN/SiNx nanocomposite, the strength of the interfacial phase 
or grain boundary can reach theoretical value and thereby terminating the grain boundary 
mediated mechanisms.  Hence, the deformation can only occur by the crack of TiN 
nanocrystals but the crack propagation may be hindered at softer SiNx interface.  As a result, 
the nanocomposite with monolayer SiNx may reach a very high hardness.  On the other 
hand, for thicker interfacial SiNx, the grain boundary mediated deformation mechanisms 
cannot be retarded by the interfacial SiNx, and therefore the strength of the nanocomposite 
lowers down to about 35 GPa which may represent the strength of the interface.  Certainly, 
the softer SiNx can still play the role in stopping the crack propagation from TiN and 
therefore the hardness enhancement of TiSiN relative to TiN may be attributed to the crack 
arresting at the softer SiNx interface. 
In this study, there are some possible reasons for the film hardness staying at about 37 
GPa, including grain size, deposition parameters, and compositions.  From Table 1, the 
grain sizes of all samples are too large, ranging from 17.7 to 37.6 nm, for grain boundary 
mediated deformation mechanisms to be prevailed.  The large grain size may be derived 
from the improper deposition parameters such as substrate bias and nitrogen flow rate.  
Since the grain size is large, both dislocation slip and grain boundary mediated deformation 
mechanisms can occur.  The evidence of dislocation slip can be verified by the effect of 
texture strengthening which will be discussed later.  However, the SiNx interlayer still plays 
a role of hindering dislocation slip or crack propagation from the TiN crystals.  
According to the phase diagram of TiN and fcc-SiN[16], the compositions of the 
specimens in this study are all fulfilled the requirements of the occurrence of spinodal 
decomposition reaction TiSiN  TiN + fcc SiN.  However, the deposition temperature may 
be not sufficiently high for the completion of spinodal decomposition.  The electrical 
resistivity can be used as an index to verify the extent of spinodal reaction.  SiNx is a 
dielectric material which is often used as the insulator in electronic devices; if the TiN 
crystals are fully surrounded by the SiNx interface phase in the nanocomposite, the electrical 
resistance may increase a few orders of magnitude compared with TiN.  The electrical 
resistance of all samples (Table 2), ranging from 251 to 306 μΩ-cm, is much lower than the 
expected value, indicating that the spinodal decomposition is not fully completed. 
Consequently, the microstructure of the nanocomposite cannot attain the optimized 
conditions for high hardness.  To enhance the spinodal decomposition and thereby obtain 
high hardness, the deposition conditions are suggested to be at higher temperature and 
substrate bias.  The higher temperature facilitates the spinodal decomposition, and the 
higher bias can reduce TiN grain size and increase the delivery of energy and momentum 
into the growing film to reach the spinodal conditions. 
The O and Si contents of the specimens are listed in Table 1.  The results indicate that 
the O contents of all samples are higher than 5 at. %, and the Si contents are ranged from 6 
10 
 
to the strengthening of the nanocomposite.  On the other hand, the stress relief increases 
with film thickness may be the reason that the nanocomposite film can be grown up to 2 m 
which is a thickness larger than that commonly reported in the previous literatures. 
The critical thickness for the film delamination can be estimated by the equation 
proposed by Freund and Suresh [37], 2 2

h    , where (hf)cr is the critical 
thickness, Ef is Young’s modulus, and ν is Poisson’s ratio of the film.  σm is the stress on the 
film and  is the required work per unit area of interface to cause delamination, which is 
constant for a given material.  Since S5 is the specimen starting to delaminate,  can be 
estimated from the data of S5.  By rearranging the above equation, the critical stress 
corresponding to the thickness of each specimen can be calculated.  The results are 
tabulated in Table 5.1, indicating that the critical stress decreases as film thickness increases.   
The results of critical stress suggest that the reason of film delamination could be due to the 
decrease of critical stress.  In other words, when the actual stress reaches critical stress, the 
film will start to delaminate. 
 
5. Conclusions 
TiN/SiNx nanocomposite films were successfully produced using unbalanced magnetron 
sputtering (UBMS) at different deposition durations.  A good combination of hardness and 
thickness, 37 GPa and 2 m, respectively, was obtained for the nanocomposite.  The 
preferred orientation of TiN phase in the TiN/SiNx nanocomposite films switched from (200) 
(S1) to (111) as thickness increased to 624 nm and above.  The hardness of the 
nanocomposite can be associated with the texture of TiN phase and compositions.  Using 
XRD and laser curvature methods, the residual stress in TiN phase and the average residual 
stress were separately measured, which enabling the assessment of the stress relief by the 
SiNx interfacial phase.  The amorphous SiNx in the TiN/SiNx nanocomposite could 
significantly relieve the average residual stress ranging from 19 to 68%.  The extent of stress 
relief increased with increasing film thickness, which may be the reason that the 
nanocomposite film can be grown to 2 m.  The critical stress for the film delamination 
decreases as film thickness increases.  The film started to delaminate as the residual stress 
reached critical stress.

Chang et al. [11] measured the corrosion current density of TiSiN coated samples by the dc 
potentiodynamic polarization method.  They found that the corrosion resistance of (Ti,Si)N 
coatings in 1 N H2SO4 solution was better than TiN coating due to the addition of Si and 
denser nano-crystalline structure of TiSiN.  Park et al. [12] reported that the corrosion 
resistance was related to the degree of encapsulation of TiN crystallites by the amorphous 
SiNx phase.  The SiNx acts as an efficient diffusion barrier due to its covalent bonding 
characteristics, and hence increasing the corrosion resistance of the TiSiN coating.  Ahmed 
et al. [13] studied the corrosion behavior by immersing the TiSiN coated steels into the 70% 
nitric acid solution for 2 to 8 days.  They discovered that pitting corrosion was prevailed in 
TiSiN coated steel specimens, which was originated from surface defects such as pinholes.  
Furthermore, they found that the compressive residual stress can suppress the propagation of 
corrosion-induced cracks through the sublayer interface and the boundaries of columnar TiN 
grains and hence causing the shrinkage of open cavities in the coatings.  However, fewer 
studies have been performed on the relation between corrosion resistance and coating 
thickness. 
Adhesion is one of the crucial properties for protective coatings.  Vaz et al. [14] 
reported that the Si in TiN phase would decrease the residual stress and result in high critical 
load.  They also found that grain size and texture are the important factors for the coating 
adhesion.  However, no significant changes were observed in the first critical load upon the 
variation of grain size or texture.  Rebouta et al.[15] deposited TiSiN coating with different 
Si content using different coating parameters by DC or RF magnetron sputtering.  They 
found that most coatings show relatively good adhesion with high critical loads over 80 N 
and low critical load ranging from 10 to 20 N.  Chen et al. [16] observed a controversial 
result showing that the adhesion strength of TiSiN coating was lower than TiN, which may be 
due to the stress and brittleness with the addition of Si3N4 phase.  Bushroa et al.[17] 
analyzed the critical load values of TiSiN coatings deposited with different coating 
parameters.  They found that not only coating thickness but also residual stress and texture 
in the coating would affect the critical load. 
It has been well acknowledged that residual stress may strongly affect the coating 
adhesion, while fewer studies have been conducted on the variation of residual stress with 
coating thickness .  Furthermore, most studies prepared the TiSiN coatings using Ti interlayer 
to improve the adhesion strength; however, the effect of Ti interlayer on the mechanical 
properties or corrosion resistance of the TiSiN coatings was seldom discussed.  The purpose 
of this research was to investigate the effect of coating thickness on the mechanical properties 
and corrosion resistance of TiSiN coatings, and the effect of Ti interlayer on the corresponding 
properties of the TiSiN coatings was also studied.  In this research, TiSiN coatings were 
deposited on both Si wafers and D2 tool steel substrates using an unbalanced magnetron 
sputtering (UBMS) system.  The coating duration was chosen as the controlling parameter to 
prepare TiSiN coatings with different thickness.  
2. Experimental Procedures 
Si wafer and AISI D2 steel were chosen as the substrates for the deposition of TiSiN 
coatings.  The dimension of Si substrate was 15 × 30 × 0.5 mm3 and that of D2 steel substrate 
was 15 × 15 × 3 mm3.  D2 steel substrates were wet ground with 120 - 2400 grit SiC papers, 
and then the substrates were polished using 4000 grit SiC paper and finally were mirror 
polished with 1 μm Al2O3 powder.  Afterwards, the Si and D2 steel substrates were 
ultrasonically cleaned progressively in acetone and methanol, each for 5 min, and were dried 
by blowing nitrogen gas, and then immediately loaded into the deposition chamber. 
TiN, SiNx, and Ti-Si-N coatings were deposited on Si wafer and D2 steel substrates in the 
same batch using reactive DC unbalanced magnetron sputtering (UBMS).  The deposition 
chamber was evacuated down to a base pressure of 6.7 × 10-4 Pa (5 × 10-6 torr) using a pumping 
4 
 
[19].  The X-ray incident angle was 2 and the scanning 2θ was ranged from 20 to 100 with 
a scanning rate being 4/min. 
The coating hardness was measured by a nanoindenter equipped on an atomic force 
microscope (AFM).  A Berkovich diamond indenter head with a nominal radius of 25 μm was 
used.  Hardness calibration was conducted using a fused quartz standard, from which  the 
accuracy of the hardness value was within 10%.  To avoid the substrate effect, the applying 
load was controlled to produce a residual indentation depth to be less than one tenth of the 
coating thickness.  The reported hardness value was the average of ten measurements and the 
precision was within 10%. A four-point probe was used to measure the electrical resistivity of 
coatings on Si wafers.    A four-point probe was used to measure the electrical resistivity of 
coatings on Si wafers. 
The residual stress of the coatings was determined by the XRD cos2αsin2ψ method [20] 
using a 4-circle diffractometer with psi-goniometer.  The shift of the selected diffraction peak 
at different psi angles was determined.  Nine tilting psi (ψ) angles, -500, -420, -330, -230, 00, 
230, 330, 420 and 500 were selected for the stress measurement.  The grazing incident angle of 
X-ray was set at 2o.  The 2θ angle of the detector was ranged from 58o to 64o to collect the 
intensity of TiN (220) peak. 
The adhesion strength of the TiSiN coatings was determined by a scratch tester equipped 
with a conical diamond tip.  The scratch was performed by drawing the diamond tip across 
the coating surface with an increasing load from 1 to 50 N and at a scratching rate of 0.01 mm/s.  
After scratching, a 5 mm long scratch track was left on the sample surface.  Three scratches 
were carried out on each sample.  Two critical loads were used to quantify the scratch test 
results.  Lc1 is defined as the normal force at the initiation of transverse cracks in the coating.  
Lc2 is defined as the normal force as the substrate begins to expose.  The initiation sites of 
transverse cracks and the substrate exposure sites were observed and recorded by an optical 
microscope.   
The corrosion resistance of the coated specimens was evaluated by potentiodynamic 
polarization scan.  Two kinds of electrolytes were chosen in this experiment: 0.5 M H2SO4 + 
0.05 M KSCN (aq) and 5 wt% NaCl (aq).  A conventional three-electrode cell was used with a 
platinum counter electrode, an Ag+/AgCl (3.5M KCl) reference electrode, and the working 
electrode.  The scanning parameters of different electrolyte were listed in the Table 2.  After 
scanning, the corrosion potential, Ecorr, and corrosion current density, Icorr can be obtained from 
the polarization curve by the Tafel plot [21]. 
For thin film processing, wettability may indicate the extent of a thin film that attaches on a 
substrate without delamination.  Contact angle can be used as an index to quantify the 
wettability of a coating deposited onto a substrate.  The measurement of contact angle and 
the calculation of surface energy was followed Owens-Wendt method [22].  The procedures 
were detailed in our previous paper [23]. 
3. Results  
The compositions and thickness of the specimens are listed in Table 3.  The 
compositions does not vary significantly for the four TiSiN specimens with different 
thickness.  The oxygen content is ranged from 3.0 to 8.4 at%, and the Si content varies in a 
narrow range from 13.3 to 15.7 at% for all samples.  The oxygen may come from the 
contamination or residual gases in the coating chamber.  The XPS data also show the 
existence of SiNx bondings in the TiSiN coatings.  The thickness of TiSiN coatings on D2, 
ranging from 696 to 3019 nm, is linearly increased with coating duration.    The maximum 
thickness of TiSiN coating on D2 substrate is up to 3 μm for a deposition duration of 4 hr.  
The thickness of Ti interlayer is about 200 nm in both T/TN and T/TSN samples. 
Since the metal-based samples were difficult to prepare a smooth cross-sectional SEM 
sample, this section only shows the representative SEM images of Si-based samples.  The 
6 
 
thickness, but the Lc2 values have a decreasing trend with increasing thickness indicating that 
the thinner coatings have better adhesion strength.  From the results, it is also evident that the 
Ti interlayer can enhance the adhesion strength in both T/TN and T/TSN samples. 
The surface energies and contact angles of TiN, SiNx, TiSiN, and Ti on D2 steel substrates 
were measured by Owens-Wendt method [22,23].  The results are tabulated in Table 5.  
The results indicate that TiN, TiSiN, SiNx, Ti coatings possess excellent wettability on D2 
substrates.  We also calculated the contact angle of TiN and TiSN on Ti layer, the results 
show that TiN has better wettability than TiSiN on Ti layer, but the TiSN still has good 
wettability (contact angle < 30°). 
The potentiodynamic polarization curves for all samples and bare D2 substrate in 0.5 M 
H2SO4 + 0.05 M KSCN solution are presented in Fig. 5 (a), where the passivation regions can 
be clearly seen from the curves.  The results of corrosion current densities (Icorr) and corrosion 
potentials (Ecorr) determined by Tafel extrapolation are listed in Table 4.  The normalized value 
of Icorr is defined as the Icorr of coated sample divided by the Icorr of bare D2 substrate.  From 
Table 4.6, one can find that the Ecorr values of all samples vary in a narrow range from -400 mV 
to -471mV, indicating that the Ecorr is the thermodynamic property only related to the reaction 
between corrosion medium and the substrate.  The comparison of Icorr between coated samples 
and D2 substrate are depicted in Fig. 6(a).  The results show that the TiSiN coating can 
effectively decrease the Icorr by two to three orders of magnitude compared with that of bare D2 
substrate and the Icorr of TiSiN coatings is lower than that of TiN coating.  Furthermore, the 
corrosion current density of the TiSiN coatings decreases with increasing thickness.  In 
addition, the samples with Ti interlayers can further lower the Icorr.   
Fig. 5(b) displays the potentiodynamic polarization curves for all samples and D2 
substrates in 5 wt% NaCl solution.  The Ecorr and Icorr calculated by Tafel method are listed in 
Table 4.  Fig. 6(b) shows the variation of Icorr with thickness in NaCl solution.  In the NaCl 
solution, the TiSiN coatings can reduce the Icorr by one to two orders of magnitude compared 
with that of bare D2 substrate.  The corrosion current densities of TiSiN coatings remain 
unchanged with increasing coating thickness.  T/TN and T/TSN samples can further decrease 
the Icorr by two to three times compared to that of TN and TSN2.  TiN has a lower Icorr than 
TiSiN coatings in NaCl solution.  
The electrical resistivity of TiN and TiSiN coatings on Si wafers was determined by a 
four-point probe.  The data are listed in Table 4.  The resistivity of TN is about 50 μΩ-cm 
and TiSiN coatings is mostly larger than 1000 μΩ-cm.  The much higher resistivity of TiSiN 
coatings may be due to the encapsulation of TiN grains by SiNx matrix. 
 
4.  Discussion 
4.1 The Structure of TiSiN Coatings 
The XRD patterns in Fig. 2(a) show only TiN peaks and no SiNx peaks in the TiSiN 
coatings.  The XPS data provide evidence of SiNx bondings in the TiSiN coatings.  The 
results of XRD and XPS indicate that the TiSiN coatings are mainly composed of crystalline 
TiN and amorphous SiNx.  Since SiNx is a dielectric material with a much higher resistivity 
(108 μΩ-cm) than TiN, the electrical resistivity may increase a few orders of magnitude 
compared with TiN, if the TiN crystals are fully surrounded by the SiNx interfacial phase in the 
nanocomposite.  From Table 4, the resistivity of TiSiN coatings is larger than that of TiN 
coating by twenty times, which is seven orders of magnitude lower than the resistivity of pure 
SiNx, indicating that the spinodal decomposition is not fully completed in the coatings. 
In addition, the diffraction patterns reveal that the TiN (111) peak for all TiSiN coatings is 
broadened after incorporating Si into TiN.  The peak broadening phenomena can be attributed 
to the refinement of TiN grains in the TiSiN nanocomposite coatings.  The grain sizes of TiN 
(111) (Table 3), ranging from 13 to 24 nm, which are smaller than the grain size of single layer 
8 
 
coating.  On the contrary, for samples TSN2, TSN3 and TSN4, dislocation slip is the major 
deformation mechanism because the grain sizes are all larger than 20 nm.  Since the three 
specimens have strong TiN(111) texture, texture strengthening may increase the resistance of 
dislocation slip and thus increase the hardness of the samples.  
In PVD process, the as-deposited coating usually possesses compressive stress due to the 
insertion of nitrogen or argon atoms into the interstitial sites by ion peening effect.  Therefore, 
higher residual stress means more defects in the coating.  In TiSiN coatings, since the SiNx is 
relatively soft than TiN, it is unlikely that SiNx can apply a significant stress on the TiN phase.  
Fig. 4 shows that except for TSN1 sample with a lower stress of -4.6 GPa, the stresses of 
samples TSN2 to TSN4 stay at a constant level about -5.3 ± 0.2 GPa regardless of increasing 
coating thickness.  The stress of TiN in TiSiN coatings are higher than that in single-phase 
TiN, which may be due to the Si atoms dissolving into the TiN crystal and hence increasing the 
stress [29].  The increase of defect density in TiN by the incorporation of Si atoms can be 
evidenced by the diffraction peak broadening of TiN phases, as shown in Fig. 2.  Since the 
dissolution of Si in TiN may be saturated at a constant level, the residual stress of TiN phase in 
TiSiN coatings does not substantially vary with thickness.  
Table 4 listed the critical loads from scratch test for all coatings on D2 steel substrate.  
The Lc1 ranges from 4 to 8 Nt and Lc2 ranges from 21 to 47 Nt for TiSiN samples.  Comparing 
the Lc2 values between TN and TSN samples, one can find that only thinner sample of TSN1 
has higher adhesion strength than TiN, the rest of TiSiN samples show lower adhesion strength 
than TiN.  The Lc1 have no substantial changes with increasing coating thickness.  As 
thickness increases, the Lc2 values decrease in the TiSiN coatings, which is inconsistent with 
our previous results [36].  The larger thickness means the scratch head needs higher load to 
penetrate the coating.  Chang et al. [11] reported that the higher compressive residual stress 
resulted in poor adhesion of TiSiN coating.  The possible reason for the decrease of Lc2 in 
TiSiN coatings with increasing thickness may be related to the higher overall residual stress at 
larger thickness in our TiSiN coatings.  Due to the lack of data in overall residual stresses of 
the TiSiN coatings on D2 steel, this hypothesis needs further study to verify.  
4.3 Corrosion Resistance  
Fig. 6(a,b) shows that in the NaCl solution, the TiSiN coatings can reduce the Icorr by one 
to two orders of magnitude compared with that of bare D2 substrate, while in 0.5 M H2SO4 
solution the Icorr can be reduced by two to three orders of magnitude.  This evidences that 
TiSiN coating is an effective corrosion resistant coating for D2 steel.  Table 4 indicates that 
Icorr of all samples tested in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution are lower than those tested in 5 wt% NaCl 
solution, suggesting that the coated-D2 specimens are more corrosion resistant in 0.5 M H2SO4 
solution than in NaCl solution.  In 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, all Icorr values of TiSiN coatings are 
smaller than that of TiN representing that the corrosion resistance of TiSiN coating are better 
than TiN coating.  This could be due to the relatively dense nanostructure of TiSiN 
nanocomposite.  From SEM images shown in Fig. 1(a,b), it can be seen that TiN coating have 
columnar structure and numerous inherent pinholes that are detrimental for corrosion 
protection; by contrast, TiSiN coatings have denser nanocomposite structure which may hinder 
the diffusion of corrosive medium through the coating and thereby improving the corrosion 
resistance.  The Icorr of TiSiN coatings decreases with increasing thickness in 0.5 M H2SO4 
solution (Fig. 6(a)).  The can be explained by the increase of diffusion length of the corrosive 
medium due to increasing coating thickness, and therefore the thicker coatings are less 
permeable by the corrosion media [37].  The corrosion behavior of TiSiN coatings shows 
different trend with coating thickness in 5 wt% NaCl solution.  From Fig. 6(b), the Icorr of TiN 
is slightly smaller than all TiSiN coatings and Icorr of TiSiN samples does not decrease with 
increasing thickness as that in 0.5M H2SO4 solution.  The results indicate that the Icorr of TiSiN 
coatings have reached a critical value regardless of increasing thickness and TiN shows better 
10 
 
the D2 substrate without Ti interlayer using an unbalanced magnetron sputtering (UBMS) 
system.  The maximum thickness of the TiSiN coatings can reach up to 3 m without 
delamination for a deposition duration of 4 hr. 
2. TiN (111) is the preferred orientation in all TiSiN coatings with increasing thickness.  
Compared with single-layered TiN coating, the incorporation of Si or the addition of a Ti 
interlayer can change the preferred orientation of TiN phase from (200) to (111) in TiSiN 
coatings. 
3. The maximum hardness of TiSiN can attain up to 36 GPa at thickness of 2.3 m.  The 
hardness of most TiSiN coatings is higher than 30 GPa, which is much higher than that of 
single-phase TiN. 
4. The residual stress of TiN in TiSiN coatings is not significantly changed with increasing 
thickness.  
5. The TiSiN-coated D2 samples can decrease the Icorr by two to three orders of magnitude in 
0.5 M H2SO4 solution, and by one to two orders of magnitude in 5 wt% NaCl solution 
compared with bare D2 substrate. 
6. From the results of scratch test and potentiodynamic polarization scan, the addition of Ti 
interlayer can increase the adhesion strength and corrosion resistance of TiSiN coatings.

作的經驗。目前台灣的學者已獲得擔任兩個議程的主持人的機會。由於擔
任議程主持人，可以推薦邀請演講者，因此每年都會有兩位或兩位以上的
教授獲邀演講，今年在本人所主持的 B1 議程，本人就邀請明志科技大學謝
彰興教授發表邀請演講，另一位獲 B5 議程邀演講者為台科大的朱瑾教授。
在此謹將心得報告如下。 
今年開議日之Plenary Session邀請德國Max Planck研究院的Peter Fratzl
教授發表大會專題演講，講題為”How Interfaces Control the Mechanical 
Behavior of Biological Materials”。他的演講主軸在於生物材料中介面所扮演
的角色，介面在材料科學中常被視為是缺陷的一種，但在生物材料中卻是
結構上重要的一環。在生物材料中，不同尺度的建構單元間之介面佔有很
小的體積，但卻具有很重要的效應。介面在生物材料中之功能主要有四種：
增加韌性、增益形變、連結不同材料與增加材料之移動性。增加韌性方面
以牙齒為例，牙齒的礦物質與蛋白質奈米交替層狀結構，可以使牙齒的任
性大幅增加，同樣的結構出現在貝殼與鮑魚外殼。可變形的介面結構如骨
間之韌帶具有塑性與自我修復的能力。連結不同材料則以樹幹的結構為
例，樹幹內的纖維包含木質部與韌皮部，硬質部分承受應力，軟質部分則
提供所需變形空間。移動性方面以昆蟲之觸鬚為例，藉由觸鬚的感知外界
的訊息，以增進移動性。個人的看法是生物材料方面的研究，目前為材料
科學方面的顯學，尤其是與人體醫學相關的材料，在學術上往往可以發表
在影響係數甚高的期刊。但是其影響所及使得傳統材料如金屬與陶瓷材料
漸受忽視，而生物材料在細胞組織與蛋白質方面，卻是材料系課程方面最
弱的部分，而且生醫材料方面的就業市場遠小於傳統工業與高科技半導

講時段與主持時段與另一重要大會演講相衝，未能到場聆聽 HiPIMS 專家
學者的專題演講。一般而言，磁控濺鍍仍是工業界主流鍍膜方法之一，有
相當多的業界論文討論，如何增加靶材使用率的問題，此外使用離子輔助
磁控濺鍍，也是磁控濺鍍的新發展。 
在業界應用方面，本人注意到有兩個趨勢，在高科技產品方面，業界需
要厚度僅有數奈米至數十奈米的薄膜；然而在工具鍍層與磨耗應用方面，
業界需要硬質鍍層的厚度至少要有 3 至 6 微米。這兩種鍍膜對現有製程都
相當具有挑戰性，在薄膜方面，由於厚度僅有數奈米，其製程需要製作非
常薄而且缺陷很少的薄膜；在厚鍍層方面，加厚硬質鍍層必須克服殘餘應
力致使鍍層剝落的問題。目前工業界在發展新的鍍膜材料時，都在此二方
面均投入相當多的人力物力，藉以得到更好的性質，使用於高附加價值的
產品。國內的研究在此高科技薄膜方面，半導體業界已具世界級水準，但
在機械應用厚膜方面，仍有待努力克服技術障礙。 
值得注意發展是理論計算或模擬的研究，在過去十年中國際上在此方面
的研究進展神速。國內必須要盡快籌組兼具實驗與計算的團隊，整合材料、
物理、化學與機械力學計算方面相關的人力，方可縮短與先進國家之差距。
目前國內在薄膜製程與分析方面研究人力尚稱充足，研究成果亦甚豐碩，
但缺乏深入之基礎研究成果，主因在理論計算或模擬方面投入不足。我們
不乏此方面之人才，但整合研究不足，不夠重視計算模擬的效用，因此與
國外相較，我們已顯著落後，此後應著力與結合理論計算與實驗，希望能
縮短差距。 
本次會議中有一事件將來可能寫入歷史值得報告。去年本人在
ICMCTF2011 口頭發表關於 TiSiN 研究論文，之後有一德國博士生引用
Fischer-Cripps 教授的數據，質問我的投影片中引用德國 Veprek 教授的硬度
數據是否不正確，但同為聽眾之一的 Veprek 教授夫人強烈的反駁。會後該

一項相當好的改進措施。相較於往年，今年台灣學生英文已有進步。今年
我所參與的議程中，台灣的碩博士生大多數能用達意的英文口頭發表論
文，但在回答問題方面，多數仍需再加強訓練。 
此次會議中論文所顯示的幾個鍍膜重要發展方向如下： 
(1) 理論計算模擬與實驗結合。此趨勢已成為國際研究團隊之主流，鍍膜與
薄膜製程如今已成為跨領域研究之重要主題之一，參與研究者之領域有
材料科學、物理、化學、化工、機械、電機等；亦有生物與醫學方面的
人加入生醫薄膜材料的研究。不論在鍍膜製程、機械性質、薄膜成長與
材料科學，均有相當深入之理論計算模擬的整合研究。 
(2) 多元複雜成分薄膜之研究已經整合，集中於少數有實用價值的系統如
TiSiN、CrSiN、TiAlN 再加上其他合金元素如 Al、C、O。其研究除了在
學理探討之外，應用研究方面著重於生產多元複合物薄膜的製程。此類
多元複合物系統用於製作超硬膜材料，應用於工模具與齒輪之鍍膜以延
長其使用壽命，不過需要研發製作厚鍍層的技術才有實用價值。由於硬
質鍍膜為消耗性產品且全球市場已達千億美元以上，對於以外貿為主的
我國而言，除了 IT 產業外，硬質鍍膜市場應是傳統機械材料升級的最佳
方向，我們應積極投入以獲取最大之效益。與會者有在大陸的台商，據
他們的資訊顯示，台灣的鍍膜科技在大陸有相當大的獲利能力，我們應
該繼續精進此方面之技術保持優勢。 
在建議方面，有以下幾點： 
(1) 近數年來台灣參與本會議之人數平均有六十人以上，可見國內從事鍍膜
的產學研界人力相當多，參與的研究生亦相當多，此方面的人力整合工
作主要由台灣鍍膜科技協會負責。去年(2011)鍍膜協會在墾丁舉辦國際
會議 TACT2011，與會者超過七百人，國際與會者(包括大陸)超過三分

發表論文摘要 
3:30pm B4.3-6 The Phase Transition and Corrosion Resistance of ZrO2(N) Thin Films 
on AISI 304 Stainless Steel Deposited by Ion Plating, 
 J.H. Huang (jhhuang@mx.nthu.edu.tw), P.-H. Huang, G.P. Yu, National Tsing Hua 
University, Taiwan 
ZrO2(N) thin films were deposited on AISI 304 stainless steel substrate using hallow 
cathode discharge ion-plating (HCD-IP). Our previous study [1] indicated that the adhesion 
of ZrO2 thin film on stainless steel was poor due to low wettability. The objectives of the 
present study were to understand the phase transition of ZrO2(N) thin films with increasing 
nitrogen contents and to provide a feasible approach to manufacture ZrO2(N) coatings on 
stainless steel with excellent corrosion resistance and good adhesion. By maintaining oxygen 
flow rate at 10 sccm and adjusting nitrogen flow rate, ranging from 0 to 12 sccm, the 
compositions and phase ratios of the ZrO2(N) thin films can be controlled. With increasing 
nitrogen flow rate, the XRD patterns showed that the phase content of c-ZrO2 increased 
while that of m-ZrO2 decreased, and then ZrN phase increased. The N solubility limit in 
ZrO2 for the formation of ZrN was 8.8 at% for the as-deposited thin film. After annealing in 
vacuum, different phase transitions were found for the specimens. At higher nitrogen content, 
phase separation of ZrN from c-ZrO2 occurred in the specimens. The corrosion resistance of 
the ZrO2(N)-coated stainless steel specimens was evaluated by potentiodynamic scan in both 
5% NaCl and in 1N H2SO4 solutions, and salt spray test was employed to assess the 
durability of the films. Corrosion resistance was associated with film packing density and 
major phases. The results showed that the HCD-IP method can effectively overcome the 
surface wetting problem of ZrO2 on stainless steel, and hence the ZrO2(N) coating on 
stainless steel possesses excellent adhesion and corrosion resistance. ZrO2(N) thin films 
containing ZrN ranging from 14.4 % to 28.8 % were found to have better corrosion resistance 
than pure ZrO2 thin films.
