摘要
長期以來乳癌的診斷必需依靠複雜的臨床及病理資料，由於複雜的關係臨床醫師及研究人員對
於開發出一套有效及準確率高的電腦診斷系統具有相當高的興趣。自從高通量技術，如微陣列實驗技
術，在 1990 年代掘起成為量測基因表現的技術後，開發新型電腦技術應用來解析微陣列基因表現資料
已成為生物資訊領域內的最重要研究方向之一。 微陣列實驗技術允許同時探測上萬個不同基因在各種
不同的實驗條件下的表現程度；經由此種大量的資料使得基因間的交互作用及調控網路的研究成為可
能。 然而也因為微陣列基因表現資料的過度龐大，使得如何分析資料及解釋結果成為生物資訊研究裡
急待開發的領域。本計畫開發出一套乳癌診斷系統(BCPP)，此系統使用病人的臨床資料用以預測病人
的癒後狀況。 分析方法分為三個步驟：第一個步驟 用統計方法先選出較顯著的基因，第二個步驟進行
乳癌癒後的分類預測，本步驟發展三種類神經演算法及四種 Kernel Function 從臨床及基因表現資料預
測病人的癒後分類狀況，第三個步驟是開發出一套乳癌診斷系統，本系統使用支持向量機及類神經演
算法從臨床資料預測病人的癒後分類狀況，初步的結果顯示本系統有相當高的準確度。

Abstract
Background: The diagnosis of cancer in most cases depends on a complex combination of clinical and
histopathological data. Because of this complexity, there exists a significant amount of interest among clinical
professionals and researchers regarding the efficient and accurate prediction of breast cancers.
Results: In this paper, we develop a breast cancer prognosis predict system that can assist medical
professionals in predicting breast cancer prognosis status based on the clinical data of patients. Our
approaches include three steps. Firstly, we select genes based on statistics methodologies. Secondly, we develop
three artificial neural network algorithms and four kernel functions of support vector machine for classifying
breast cancers based on either clinical features or microarray gene expression data. The results are extremely
good; both ANN and SVM have near perfect performance (99 –100%) for either clinical or microarray data.
Finally, we develop a user-friendly breast cancer prognosis predict (BCPP) system that generates prediction
results using either support vector machine (SVM) or artificial neural network (ANN) techniques.
Conclusions: Our approaches are effective in predicting the prognosis of a patient because of the very high

1. Background
Cancer diagnosis in most cases depends on using a complex combination of clinical and histopathological data;
however, it is often difficult or impossible to recognize the tumour type in some atypical instances [8]. Almost one out of
ten women will have breast cancer in her lifetime, and around 70% of tumours express the estrogen receptor (ER). In the
past decade, DNA microarray technologies have had a great impact on cancer genome research; this technology measures
the expression level for millions of gene expressions simultaneously [4]. It is a powerful tool in the study of functional
genomes [1,7]. Large scale profiling of gene expression and genomic alternations using DNA microarrays can reveal the
differences between normal and malignant cells, genetic and cellular changes at each stage of tumour progression and
metastasis, as well as the difference among cancers of different origins. Cancer classification is becoming the critical basis
for the therapy of patients. There are several machine learning techniques such as k-nearest neighbors, back-propagation,
probabilistic neural network, multicategory support vector machines (MC-SVM) [11], Bayesian network [2,4,6], and the
module–network [9,10] that have been applied in cancer classification. Most of these classification algorithms, however,
suffer from a high dimensional input space due to a large amount of DNA microarrary gene expression data. Reducing the
number of genes needed while maintaining a consistently high accuracy can provide a way to avoid these problems. In this
paper, we propose three approaches to predict the prognosis of breast cancer using both microarray and clinical data.
The main goals of this study are: (1) to select genes based on biostatistics, (2) to classify breast cancers based on
clinical features and microarray gene expression data, and (3) to develop an intelligent system for breast cancer analysis
and classification based on clinical data.
2. Methods
2.1 Data Sources
In cancer research, the most intriguing use of gene expression arrays has been in the molecular classification of tumours.
In this study, both clinical and microarray data were used [12]. We combined the data of two groups of patients together to
expand the number of samples. In this case, we have 97 patients of which 51 patients belonged to the good prognosis
group (survive greater than 5 years) and 46 patients belonged to the poor prognosis group (survive less than 5 years). The
microarray data consists of 24,881 genes for each patient. For clinical data, each patient has 9 features recorded (See Table
1).

Three kinds of BPN training algorithms were used to obtain optimal results: conjugate gradient algorithm, Levenberg-
Marquarft algorithm, and the One-Step-Secant algorithm.
2.5 Support Vector Machine
Both linear SVM and non-linear SVM algorithms were developed recently. Linear SVM solves an optimization
problem that seeks a maximum margin classifier. In this algorithm, a hyperplane is developed with a maximum margin
width that separates the training instances of two classes (Figure 2).
Figure 2. A linear SVM selects a line that maximizes the width of the margin between the two classes [11].
In practice, however, most applications are non-linear. In non-linear SVM algorithms, kernel functions are applied to
implicitly map data into a higher dimensional space so that data can be delineated into two classes by a hyperplane (Figure
3).
Figure 3. A non-linear SVM uses a hyperplane to classify two classes by using kernel function mapping to a high
dimension space.
In this paper, we use a linear SVM algorithm and a non-linear SVM algorithm with three kinds of kernel functions:
polynomial, radial basis, and sigmoid. SVM codes were written in MatLab using the LIBSVM package [3] because they
use state-of-the-art optimization methods for solving multi-category SVM problems.
3. Breast cancer prognosis prediction (BCPP) system
In this paper, we develop a breast cancer prognosis prediction (BCPP) system that can assist medical professionals in
predicting breast cancer prognosis status based on the clinical data of patients. The system generates prediction results
using either support vector machine (SVM) or artificial neural network (ANN) techniques.

4.1 Performance of the classification system based on clinical data
We demonstrate here the usefulness of the proposed methodology to the clinical data of breast cancer. Table 2
summarizes the results generated from four kernel functions of SVM algorithms and three ANN algorithms.

four kernel functions of SVM algorithms and three ANN algorithms.

The accuracy of classification is near perfect (99% and 100%) for linear (LINEAR) SVM, polynomial (POLY) SVM,
radial basis (REF) SVM, conjugate gradient (CG) ANN, and Levenberg-Marquarft (LM) ANN. Only sigmoid (SIG) SVM
(52.6%) and the One-Step-Secant (OSS) ANN (87%) have a worse performance. This excellent performance is a strong
argument for the development of our BPCC system.
4.2 Performance of the classification system based on the microarray gene expression data
Instead of using all 24,481 genes, we developed a T-score to select the top genes starting from 500 genes to 20000
genes for every 1000 genes as an interval. The effect of gene number selected using T-score is summarized in Table 3.
Table 3. The effect of gene number on the accuracy performance using four SVM algorithms: The gene number selected
ranges from 500 genes to 20000 genes. The accuracy performance was calculated using four kernel functions of SVM
algorithms

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we develop a breast cancer prognosis prediction system that can assist medical professionals in evaluating
a patient’s breast cancer prognosis based on the clinical data of the patient. Our approaches include three steps. First, we 
select genes based on statistical methodologies and medical literatures. Second, we develop three artificial neural network
algorithms and four kernel functions of a support vector machine for classifying breast cancers based on either clinical
features or microarray gene expression data. The results are extremely good; both ANN and SVM have near perfect
performance for either clinical or microarray data. Finally, we develop a user-friendly breast cancer prognosis prediction
(BCPP) system that generates prediction results using either support vector machine (SVM) or artificial neural network
(ANN) techniques. The BCPP system is a computer-aided system developed from LabVIEW and MatLab interfaces. To
our knowledge, this is a novel system which can be used in the classification of cancers.
