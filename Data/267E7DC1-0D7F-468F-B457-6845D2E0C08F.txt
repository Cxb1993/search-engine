concept of continuous differentiability of fuzzy-valued functions. Under these settings, we can derive
the optimality conditions for obtaining the nondominated solutions by introducing the Lagrange
multipliers.
3 Research Methodology
Let A = [aL, aU ] and B = [bL, bU ] be two closed intervals in R. We write A ≤ B if and only if
aL ≤ bL and aU ≤ bU , and A < B if and only if the following conditions are satisfied{
aL < bL
aU ≤ bU or
{
aL ≤ bL
aU < bU
or
{
aL < bL
aU < bU
.
Let a˜ and b˜ be two fuzzy numbers. Then a˜α = [a˜
L
α, a˜
U
α ] and b˜α = [b˜
L
α, b˜
U
α ] be two closed intervals
in R for all α ∈ [0, 1]. We write a˜  b˜ if and only if a˜α ≤ b˜α for all α ∈ [0, 1], or equivalently, a˜Lα ≤ b˜Lα
and a˜Uα ≤ b˜Uα for all α ∈ [0, 1]. It is easy to see that “” is a partial ordering on F(R).
Now we consider the following optimization problem with fuzzy-valued objective function
(FMOP1) min f˜(x) =
(
f˜1(x), · · · , f˜r(x)
)
subject to x = (x1, x2, · · · , xn) ∈ X ⊆ Rn,
where each objective function f˜k, k = 1, · · · , r, is a fuzzy-valued function and the feasible set X is
assumed to be a convex subset of Rn. For instance, the kth fuzzy-valued objective function f˜k(x)
can be taken as the linear-type objective function
f˜k(x) =
(
a˜1 ⊗ 1˜{x1}
)⊕ (a˜2 ⊗ 1˜{x2})⊕ · · · ⊕ (a˜n ⊗ 1˜{xn}) ,
where each a˜i is a canonical fuzzy number and each 1˜{xi} is a crisp number with value xi for
i = 1, · · · , n.
We need to interprete the meaning of minimization in problem (FMOP1). We are going to
follow the similar solution concept (the nondominated solution) used in multiobjective programming
problem to interprete the meaning of minimization in problem (FMOP1).
Let a˜ and b˜ be two fuzzy numbers. We write a˜ ≺ b˜ if and only if a˜α < b˜α for all α ∈ [0, 1]. In
other words, a˜ ≺ b˜ if and only if{
a˜Lα < b˜
L
α
a˜Uα ≤ b˜Uα
for all α ∈ [0, 1] or
{
a˜Lα ≤ b˜Lα
a˜Uα < b˜
U
α
for all α ∈ [0, 1] or
{
a˜Lα < b˜
L
α
a˜Uα < b˜
U
α
for all α ∈ [0, 1].
We say that a˜ = (a˜1, · · · , a˜r) is a fuzzy vector if each a˜k is a fuzzy number for k = 1, · · · , r. Let
a˜ = (a˜1, · · · , a˜r) and b˜ = (b˜1, · · · , b˜r) be two fuzzy vectors. We write a˜  b˜ if and only if a˜k  b˜k for
all k = 1, · · · , r, and write a˜ ≺ b˜ if and only if a˜k  b˜k for all k = 1, · · · , r and a˜h ≺ b˜h for at least
one index h.

for every feasible solution x. If we further assume that g˜j is continuously H-differentiable on some
neighborhoods of x¯, say Nj(x¯), then the real-valued function GUj defined in (1) is continuously
differentiable on Nj(x¯) and
∂GUj
∂xi
(x) =
∫ 1
0
∂(g˜j)
U
α
∂xi
(x)dα
for all x ∈ N (x¯) and all i = 1, · · · , n. We have∫ 1

∇(g˜j)Uα (x¯)dα =
(∫ 1

∫ 1

∂(g˜j)
U

∂xn

)T
.
Therefore if g˜j is continuously H-differentiable on Nj(x¯), then we have
∇GUj (x) = ∇
∫ 1
0
(g˜j)
U
α (x¯)dα =
∫ 1
0
∇(g˜j)Uα (x¯)dα (2)
for j = 1, · · · ,m.
Now we consider the following (conventional) optimization problem
(P2) min F (x)
subject to GUj (x) ≤ 0, j = 1, · · · ,m
Let x∗ be a feasible solution of problem (FMOP2), i.e., (g˜j)Uα (x
∗) ≤ 0 for all α ∈ [0, 1], which
imply that GUj (x
∗) =
∫ 1
0
(g˜j)
U
α (x
∗)dα ≤ 0. It shows that x∗ is a feasible solution of problem (P2).
Therefore, we obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 4.1 If x∗ is a feasible solution of problem (FMOP2), then x∗ is also a feasible solution
of problem (P2).
4.1 Optimality Conditions for Weakly Continuously Differentiable Case
In this subsection, the fuzzy-valued objective functions f˜k, k = 1, · · · , r, are assumed as weakly
continuously differentiable at a feasible solution x∗. Therefore, we see that all of the results presented
in this subsection also hold true for continuously H-differentiable case. However, we shall present
some KKT conditions for continuously H-differentiable case in the next subsection.
4.1.1 Optimality Conditions for Pareto Optimal Solutions
Let f˜k be fuzzy-valued functions defined on Rn for all k = 1, · · · , r. Since (f˜k)Lα(x) and (f˜k)Uα (x),
k = 1, · · · , r, are Riemann integrable on [0, 1] with respect to the variable α for any fixed x, we
define
FLk (x) =

U
k (x) =
∫ 1

(f˜k)
U
α (x)dα
for all k = 1, · · · , r.
Under the above settings, we are now in a position to present the optimality conditions for
problem (FMOP2).

fuzzy-valued objective functions f˜k : Rn → Fc(R), k = 1, · · · , r, are pseudoconvex at x∗ and weakly

Now we are going to present the optimality conditions for weakly Pareto optimal solutions.
Theorem 4.6 Let X be a feasible set of problem (FMOP2) and a point x∗ ∈ X. Suppose that there
exists a fuzzy-valued objective function, say the hth fuzzy-valued objective function f˜h : Rn → Fc(R),
such that it is convex at x∗ and weakly continuously differentiable on some neighborhoods of x∗, say
N (x∗), and each of the fuzzy-valued constraint functions g˜j : Rn → Fc(R) is convex at x∗ and weakly

We are going to present the optimality conditions when the fuzzy-valued objective functions are
continuously H-differentiable at a feasible point x∗.
4.2.1 Optimality Conditions for Pareto Optimal Solutions
Now we are going to present the optimality conditions for Pareto optimal solutions.
Definition 4.2 Let f˜ : X → Fc(R) be a fuzzy-valued function defined on a convex set X ⊆ Rn.
(i) We say that f˜ is contra-decreasing (resp. weakly contra-decreasing) at x∗ if f˜(x) ≺ f˜(x∗) then
x > x∗ (resp. x ≥ x∗) for x ∈ X.
(ii) We say that f˜ is strictly contra-decreasing (resp. strictly weakly contra-decreasing) at x∗ if
f˜(x)  f˜(x∗) then x > x∗ (resp. x ≥ x∗) for x ∈ X.

Theorem 4.12 Let X be a feasible set of problem (FMOP2) and a point x∗ ∈ X. Suppose that the
fuzzy-valued objective functions f˜k : Rn → Fc(R), k = 1, · · · , r, are strictly contra-decreasing at x∗
and continuously H-differentiable on some neighborhoods of x∗, say N (x∗), and each of the fuzzy-
valued constraint functions g˜j : Rn → Fc(R) is convex at x∗ and weakly continuously differentiable
on some neighborhoods of x∗, say Nj(x∗), for j = 1, · · · ,m. We assume that each of the fuzzy-valued
objective functions is either strictly pseudoconvex or convex at x∗. If there exist positive real numbers
λk for all k = 1, · · · , r and nonnegative real numbers µLj and µUj for j = 1, · · · ,m such that

4.2.3 Optimality Conditions for Strongly Pareto Optimal Solutions
We see that if f˜ is H-differentiable at x¯ then (∂f˜Lα /∂xi)(x¯) ≤ (∂f˜Uα /∂xi)(x¯) for all i = 1, · · · , n and all
α ∈ [0, 1]. We say that f˜ has a non-degenerated H-gradient at x¯ if there exists an i ∈ {1, · · · , n} such
that (∂f˜Lα /∂xi)(x¯) < (∂f˜
U
α /∂xi)(x¯) for all α ∈ [0, 1]. We say that f˜ has a strictly non-degenerated
H-gradient at x¯ if (∂f˜Lα /∂xi)(x¯) < (∂f˜
U
α /∂xi)(x¯) for all α ∈ [0, 1] and all i = 1, · · · , n. It also says
that ∇f˜Lα (x¯) < ∇f˜Uα (x¯) for all α ∈ [0, 1]. By referring to Proposition 4.2, we also have the following
result.
Proposition 4.3 Suppose that the fuzzy-valued function f˜ is continuously H-differentiable on some
neighborhoods of x¯ and has a strictly non-degenerated H-gradient at x¯. Then ∇FL(x¯) < ∇FU (x¯).
Theorem 4.13 Let X be a feasible set of problem (FMOP2) and a point x∗ ∈ X. Suppose that there
exists a fuzzy-valued objective function, say the hth fuzzy-valued objective function f˜h : Rn → Fc(R),
such that it is upper-convex and strictly contra-decreasing at x∗ and continuously H-differentiable on
some neighborhoods of x∗, say N (x∗), and each of the fuzzy-valued constraint functions g˜j : Rn →
Fc(R) is convex at x∗ and weakly continuously differentiable on some neighborhoods of x∗, say
Nj(x∗), for j = 1, · · · ,m. Let us futrher assume that f˜h has a strictly non-degenerated H-gradient
at x∗. If there exist nonnegative real numbers µLj and µ
