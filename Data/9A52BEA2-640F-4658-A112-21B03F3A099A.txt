residues play different roles in formation of a stable structure, catalytic, or substrate binding sites 
[21].  Structure conservation were discovered in literatures such as the Cytochromes P450 [22, 
23], the CheY superfamily [24], and protein-DNA recognition complexes [25].  In addition, 
protein stability is another issue accompanied with the topic of protein flexibility because both of 
them are required for protein function. 
In this paper, we propose a framework for discovering protein supporting structures for 
enzyme family by encoding protein three-dimensional space of protein local structure into 
one-dimensional structural signatures.  Protein three-dimensional structure will be encoded into 
a set of one-dimensional structural signatures for fast searching on spatial feature.  Supporting 
structure is formed by comprising conserved structural signatures which means that structural 
signature has higher coverage among proteins.  Furthermore, the relationship between 
supporting structure, protein function, protein stability, and protein flexibility can be observed 
under functional hierarchical classification of enzyme.  Moreover, the mechanism of protein 
activity could be inferred based on discovered supporting structures. 
二、研究方法 
In this paper, we discover protein supporting structure by identifying rigid structure among 
proteins based on enzyme classification, one of hierarchical functional classification.  Materials 
for this framework are to collect protein structures in PDB based on enzyme classification, and 
will be illustrated in detail in the following subsection.  Next, we explore our framework to 
discover supporting structure of proteins for enzyme family.  As shown in Figure 1, the overall 
framework consists of three major components: (1) neighborhood residues sphere recognition; (2) 
1D structural signature encoding; (3) signature clustering and supporting structure discovery.

In ENZYME Data Bank, Bairoch collected the repository of information relative to the 
nomenclature of enzymes.  For each enzyme family, the information is primarily based on the 
recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry 
and Molecular Biology (IUBMB), which link protein sequence information in SWISS-PROT

Å default layer bucket with 1 Å buffer layer bucket.  The design concept of buffer layer is to 
provide fault tolerance while the point is located near to or on the boundary of default layer 
bucket.  Figure 4 is a diagram of three-dimensional space to present our encoding scheme, and 
the default layer is the solid line and buffer layer is the dash line.  Finally, we can obtain 10 bits 
of default layer and 10 bits of buffer layer in each quadrant, and 8 quadrants will have 160 bits in 
total.

NRS comparisons pass the GH threshold.  Hence, we define SigCrn in eq. 4 to evaluate the 
quality of signature for each enzyme family.  The SigCrn is defined as the number of qualified 
signature over number of candidate signature, and the candidate signature is the signature with 
more than there NRSs.  In Figure 5, the X-axis is selected enzyme families and Y-axis is SigCrn 
with different threshold of GH score of 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95% respectively.  As shown 
in Figure 5, while the threshold of GH score ranges from 75% to 90%, the SigCrn is above 95% 
in average.  It means that the design of structural signature correlates closely with spatial 
information of local structure.  The threshold of GH score determined by experiments is 75% 
finally.

3.2. 蛋白質支持結構的探勘 
The idea to discover protein supporting structures of protein family is focusing on the concept 
of protein stability associated with protein functional site.  In order to keep protein function, 
protein structure should maintain the level of flexibility to bind ligands or substrates to provide 
functions, but regions with high stability will support the functional site.  Therefore, the 
signature will be a part of supporting structure if the SSCov is higher 75% while including the 
signature.  Because SSCov is used to control the coverage of supporting structure, we find that 
discovered supporting structure can be located near functional site according to observations.  
The roles supporting structure play are to support functional site to cooperate with regions with 
low stability to interact with substrates or ligands for protein function.

biochemical reaction so protein stability and protein flexibility will also affect their binding 
affinity together.  In case studies, we find that supporting structure can be located in the tong 
heads to clamp substrates, or in the bottom of functional site to support substrates, or near to 
hinge point to support regions with low stability.  Supporting structure is regions with high 
stability which can be used to support protein function depend on mechanism of biological 
reaction. 
五、結論 
This study presented here provides a look at the way in discovering supporting structure by 
detecting rigid structure among proteins shared the same protein function.  Protein provides its 
function by interacting with ligands, substrates, metal ions, or proteins.  Therefore, protein 
controls conformational flexibility to interact with different ligands, substrates, metal ions, to 
function.  Another viewpoint for protein function is protein stability which means that regions 
with high stability play a role to sustain ligands or substrates; therefore, rigid structure 
identification is important point to understand how protein works.  Furthermore, regions with 
high stability provide another angle to observe the link between functional site and protein local 
structure.  In summary, protein function requires both of structure flexibility and structure 
stability. 
In summary, this paper proposes the framework for discovering supporting structure for 
enzyme family by rigid structure identification.  In our observations, we find that protein 
structure should maintain a degree of flexibility to control different size of ligands or substrates 
for multiple functions; therefore, they have stable regions to vise or support ligands or substrates 
and flexible regions to play roles to control the stable regions.  Then discovering supporting 
structure gives us another way to understand how regions with high stability cooperate with 
ligands or substrates.  But it is still a difficult work to infer relation of protein function and 
protein local structure directly by discovering supporting structure because of the amount of 
determined protein structure for mechanism of protein activity.  It is still a long way to study the 
linkage between protein function, protein stability and protein flexibility because not all enzyme 
families have enough protein structures for analysis.
