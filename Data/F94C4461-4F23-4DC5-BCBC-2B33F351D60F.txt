and the VP X  chart are similar in detecting small 
mean shifts. 
Although Costa (1998 & 1999) and Chou et al. 
(2006) performed the designs of joint adaptive X  
and R charts and indicated joint VP X  and R charts 
have the best efficiency when both mean and 
variance occur in small shifts. However, the sample 
size of joint adaptive control charts in detecting 
shifts were never measured, and the previous 
literature never clearly evaluated the performance of 
adaptive R charts without combined other X  charts. 
VP charts can be simplified as variable sample sizes 
and control limits (VSSC) scheme, and Lin & Chou 
(2005) and Chen & Hsieh (2007) have extended the 
VSSC to the X  chart and the T2 chart and showed 
their good performance in small shift detection, 
respectively. A VSSC idea has been successfully 
applied, but construction and evaluation of VSSC R 
charts were not found in the previous literature. In 
addition to VSSC, the variable sample interval and 
control limits (VSIC) scheme also is a simplification 
of the VP chart, but the VSIC R chart was never 
developed and measured for performance. 
This paper constructs two new adaptive R 
charts: VSSC and VSIC R charts, and develops 
statistical indicators of adaptive R charts with a 
Markov chain model and distribution of relative 
range. A design approach of adaptive R charts is 
modeled for determining the optimal parameters. 
This work also investigates the performance of all 
adaptive R charts and compares them with R and s 
charts. 
 
2. Adaptive R control charts 
2.1. Construction of VP R chart 
This section will extend the VP X chart to 
construct a VP R chart. A VP R chart also uses two 
different sampling intervals, sample sizes, 
coefficients of warning limit coefficients and control 
limit. When the sample range R is close to the 
average range, the VP R chart is to use a small 
sample size (n1), the long sampling interval (h1), the 
wide coefficients of control limit (k1) and warning 
limit (w1) to monitor the process standard deviation. 
However, if the sample range R heavily deviates 
from the average range but does not fall out the 
control limits, a large sample size (n2), short 
sampling interval (h2) and narrow coefficients of 
control limit (k2) and warning limit (w2) are used to 
monitor the process standard deviation. 
A VP R control chart as Figure 1 employs 
warning limits and control limits to divide the chart 
into three regions: central region, warning region 
and action region. Let respectively ki and wi be as 
the control limit and the warning limit coefficients 
of the VP R control chart with sample size ni for i = 
1 and 2. Eq.(1) can be extended to calculate the 
center lines, control limits and warning limits of the 
VP R control chart, and they are

VSIC and VP have smaller out-of-control AATS 
values. To compare VP with VSIC and VSSC, VP 
has slightly smaller out-of-control AATS values in 
detecting small shifts than VSIC and VSSC, but 
their out-of-control ANOS values are approximate. 
Therefore, VP has the best performance in detecting 
small shifts.

For detection of large shifts, AATS values of all 
charts are approximate, but out-of-control ANOS 
values of VSS, VSSI, VSSC and VP are larger than 
values of SR and SS. Values of out-of-control AATS 
and ANOS of SR and SS are approximate for all 
shift sizes. 
In summary, a VP R chart can quickly detect 
shifts, and its sample sizes are more economical than 
other charts in detection of all shifts. However, for 
large shift detection, all charts in detecting ability 
are approximate, but the Shewhart R chart has more 
economical sample sizes. The performances of the 
Shewhart R chart and the Shewhart s chart are 
approximate, but the Shewhart s chart in 
construction and calculation is more complex than 
the Shewhart R chart. Therefore, the Shewhart R 
chart is more suitable in large shift detection than the 
Shewhart s chart. If the process standard deviation 
always shifts slightly, a VP R chart is very suitable 
to be used in process monitoring. However, when 
large shifts of the process standard deviation always 
occur, a Shewhart R chart should be chosen to 
monitor the process. 
 
5. A real case 
Wire bonding is a key process in IC packaging 
and is the most common method for electrical 
connecting the aluminum bonding pads on a 
microchip surface to the package inner lead 
terminals on the lead-frame. In the wire bonding 
process, the gold ball shear strength is an important 
quality characteristic and must be monitored 
effectively to stabilize IC quality. The destructive 
testing approach is utilized to measure the ball shear 
strength, the test sample will be destructive and can 
not be sold to customers. Since the ball shear 
strength variance of the same IC is very small, 
previous sampling approaches took 5 ICs per 
sampling and randomly selected one ball from each 
IC to perform testing. A standard Shewhart R chart

The Shewhart R control chart (R chart) has been widely used to monitor process variance.
However, the main disadvantage of an R chart is its slowness to signal small increases on
the variability. In this paper, ideas of adaptive control charts are extended to the Shewhart R
chart for improving efficiency in signaling increases on the variance. AMarkov chainmodel
is applied to evaluate its performance. The statistical performance shows that the R chart
with variable parameters (VP) is more sensitive to variance increases.

1. Introduction
Statistical methods are often used in process monitoring. When an assignable cause occurs, the process will change. The
control chart detects process changes and sends the operators to discover the assignable cause. Dr. Shewhart developed
the X control chart for monitoring the process mean variation. He assumed that the process standard deviation remains
unchanged. However, in real processes, increases on the variance variability may occur. When the process is in-control, the
standard deviation stays on its target value, but after the assignable occurrence the standard deviation increases and the
process goes out-of-control. The increases on the process standard deviation will induce the process capability increasing
the defective rate. If the assignable cause cannot be quickly eliminated, high losses may result.
The Shewhart R chart (R chart) and the Shewhart s chart (s chart) are used to monitor process variance. An R chart works
with sample ranges which are the difference between the largest and smallest observations of a sample of size n. An R chart
is easier to deal with if comparedwith an s chart. In addition, the R chart and the s chart are both insensitive to small variance
increases.
Many previous studies have applied ideas of adaptive control charts to improve efficiency of control charts in detecting
small process shifts. Adaptive X control charts include the following: variable sampling intervals (VSI); variable sample
sizes (VSS); variable sample sizes and sampling intervals (VSSI); variable sample sizes and control limits (VSSC) and variable
parameters (VP) control charts, and their applications have successfully increased the sensitivity in detecting small mean
shifts (Reynolds et al., 1988; Reynolds, 1996a,b; Prabhu et al., 1993, 1994; Costa, 1994, 1997, 1999; Zimmer et al., 1998, 2000;
DeMagalhães et al., 2002; Celano, 2009;Mahadik and Shirke, 2009; Lin, 2009; Shu and Jiang, 2006; Shu et al., 2008; Luo et al.,
2009). In addition to adaptive control charts, Daudin (1992) had proposed the double sampling (DS) chart, a modification
of the Shewhart-type chart as well as a counterpart to double sampling plans. The design and performance of the DS-type
chart has been studied (He et al., 2002, 2003, 2006; He and Grigoryan, 2002; Torng et al., 2009a,b). Torng and Lee (2009)
have shown that the performances of the DS X chart and the VP X chart are similar in detecting small mean shifts.

Fig. 1. A VP R char t and its control procedure.
A VP R control chart like Fig. 1 employs warning limits and control limits to divide the chart into three regions: central
region, warning region and action region. Let respectively ki andwi be the control limit and the warning limit coefficients of
the VP R control chart with sample size ni for i = 1 and 2. Eq. (1) can be applied the center lines, control limits and warning
limits of the VP R control chart:
UCL1 = [d2(n1)+ k1d3(n1)]σ0,
UWL1 = [d2(n1)+ w1d3(n1)]σ0,
CL1 = d2(n1)σ0,
UCL2 = [d2(n2)+ k2d3(n2)]σ0,
UWL2 = [d2(n2)+ w2d3(n2)]σ0,
CL2 = d2(n2)σ0
(3)
where CLi, UCLi and UWLi are the center line, the upper control limit and the upper warning limit of sample size ni,
respectively.
Assuming the process starts an in-control. The first sampling will take a small sample n1 to obtain the sample range R
that is plotted on the chart considering its left-hand scale (Fig. 1). If the 1st sample point falls in the central region, the next
sample size and the next sampling interval will be n1 and h1, and then again the 2nd sample range is plotted on the chart
using the left-hand scale. If the sample range falls in the warning region, the next sample size and the next sampling interval
will be n2 and h2. Now, the 2nd sample range is plotted on the chart using the right-hand scale. As usual, the R chart signals
when a sample range falls beyond the control limit.
The control procedure of the VP R chart is themost complex for all adaptive R charts, and the VP R chart can be simplified
by reducing the number of variable parameters. Let k0, n0 and h0 be the control limit coefficient, the sample size and the
sampling interval of a Shewhart R chart, respectively.When n1 = n2 = n0, k2 = k1 andw2 = w1, the VP R chart will become
a VSI R chart. If h1 = h2 = h0, k2 = k1 and w2 = w1, the VP R chart will be simplified as a VSS R chart. For the case of
k2 = k1 and w2 = w1, the VP R chart will become a VSSI R chart. When h1 = h2 = h0, the VP R chart is a VSSC R chart.
If n1 = n2 = n0, the VP R chart will be a VSIC R chart. For the case of w1 = k1 = k0, w2 = k2 = 0, h2 = h1 = h0 and
n1 = n2 = n0, the VP R chart will be the Shewhart R chart.
3.2. Performance indicators
Tagaras (1998) presented several statistical measures to assess the performance of adaptive control charts, such as:
1. Average run length (ARL) is defined as the expected number of samples taken from the start of the process to the time
when the chart signals. The in-control ARL is used to measure the false alarm rate, and the out-of-control ARL measures
the speed with the control chart signals.
2. Average Time to Signal (ATS) is defined as the expected value of the time from the start of the production to the time
when the chart signals. ATS is a measure of the false alarm rate.
3. Adjusted Average Time to Signal (AATS) is defined as the expected time from the occurrence of an assignable cause to
the time the chart signals an out-of-control signal.
4. Average Number of Observations to Signal (ANOS) is defined as the expected number of individual observations from the
start of the production (or the time of the assignable cause occurrence) to the time the chart signals. ANOS represents
the total of inspected items during the in-control or out-of-control period.
Assuming the initial state of a process is in-control, and the process standard deviation is σ = σ0, when an assignable
cause occurs, the process standard deviation shifts from the σ = σ0 to σ = σ1 = γ σ0. If γ = 1, the process is an in-control
state. If γ > 1, the process is out-of-control. For γ < 1, it indicates the quality of the products improved.
Lin and Chou (2007) provided an easy approach to calculate performance indicators of adaptive control charts, and their
approach can also be applied to adaptive R control charts. The ARL, ANOS, ATS and AATS of a VP R control chart can be
calculated from the Markov chain method, which includes the following three transition states:
P.-H. Lee / Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 55 (2011) 2003–2010 2007
If the position of the shift within the sampling interval is uniformly distributed, then
AATS = r˜T[(I− Q)−1h− 0.5h] (15)
where r˜T = [r˜1 r˜2] is the vector of starting probabilities with r˜i = rihi/(r1h1 + r2h2), for i = 1, 2. Therefore, r˜T is
r˜T =
[
p2h1
p2h1 + (1− p1)h2
(1− p1)h2
p2h1 + (1− p1)h2
]
.
The expected in-control sample size E(n|γ = 1) and sampling interval E(h|γ = 1) of the VP R control chart are
E(n|γ = 1) = ANOS(γ = 1)/ARL(γ = 1),
E(h|γ = 1) = ATS(γ = 1)/ARL(γ = 1). (16)
4. Design model of adaptive R charts
The eight design parameters of a VP R chart are chosen taking into account a design model with the aim of making it
comparable with the R chart and other control charts. The objective function and constraints of the design model that will
be set for the design of a VP R chart are as follows: (1) The in-control ATS takes a standard value τ = 370.4; (2) During the
in-control period, the expected sample size and sampling interval are equal to the sample size and sampling interval of a
Shewhart R chart; and (3) The AATS is the parameter to be minimized. Therefore, the design model is the following:
Min AATS(γ > 1)
s.t. ATS(γ = 1) = τ
E(n|γ = 1) = n0
E(h|γ = 1) = h0
h1 > h0 > h2 > 0
n2 > n0 > n1 > 1
k1 > w1 > 0
k1 > k2 > w2 > 0
n0, n1, n2 ∈ Integer.
According to Lin and Chou (2007), h1 = [h0(n2 − n1) − h2(n0 − n1)]/(n2 − n0). Therefore, the decision variables of
the model only include seven parameters: n1, n2, k1, w1, k2, w2 and h2. The model can also be used to optimize the design
parameters of other adaptive R charts. For instance, n1 = n2 = n0, k2 = k1 and w2 = w1, the optimum parameters of the
VSI R chart can be obtained by solving the model.
Before solving thismodel, the shift size coefficient γ should be specified first. This study assumes γ = 1.1 and 1.5, in view
of a fast detection of small shifts. The Matlab optimization toolbox applies a nonlinear constrained optimization algorithm
for solving nonlinear models. De Magalhães et al. (2001), Mahadik and Shirke (2009) and Torng and Lee (2009) had used
the Matlab optimization toolbox to determine the parameters of control charts. The performance indicators are coded with
Matlab R2007a, and the optimization toolbox is then applied to solve design parameters of adaptive R charts.
5. A comparative study
In this section, a comparative study is conducted to evaluate the performance of adaptive R charts, R chart (SR) and S
chart (SS). The false alarm rate of each chart is set to be equal, and so is the in-control expected sample size and sampling
interval of each chart, such that the comparison can be conducted in terms of the AATS. Process monitoring in industries in
general uses sample size 3 or 5 and sampling interval of 1 h to set up the Shewhart R chart. Therefore, this study considers
n0 = 3 and 5 and h0 = 1 and the optimization is preformed assuming γ = 1.1 and 1.5. Afterward, shifts of γ = 1.05, 1.1,
1.15, 1.2, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2 and 3 are chosen to obtain the ANOS and AATS. These ANOS and AATS calculations of adaptive R
charts have been expressed in Section 3.2, and the indicator calculations of the Shewhart s chart are presented in Appendix.
The shift sizes 1 < γ ≤ 1.5 were defined as small standard deviation shifts, and shift sizes γ > 1.5 were defined as large
shifts.
Tables 1 and 2 provide the optimal design parameters of adaptive R charts, the R chart (SR) and the s chart (SS) and their
performances. The in-control ATS and ANOS values of all control charts are the same. For detection of small shifts, SR, SS,
VSI, VSS and VSSI have larger AATS and ANOS values. If compared with the VSSC, VSIC and VP charts, the VP chart is slightly
faster in signaling small shifts, however their ANOS are almost the same. Therefore, VP has the best performance in detecting
small shifts.
For large shifts, the AATS of all charts are almost the same, but the ANOS values of the VSS, VSSI, VSSC and VP are larger
than that of the SR and SS charts. The AATS and ANOS of SR and SS are almost the same for all shift sizes.
In summary, a VP R chart can quickly detect shifts, and its sample sizes are more economical than all other charts.
However, for a large shift, all charts have a similar performance, but the R chart is more economical in terms of inspection

The ARL, ANOS, ATS and AATS of a Shewhart s chart are the following
ARL(γ ) = 1/P(γ ),
ATS = ARL(γ = 1)× h0,
AATS(γ ) = [ARL(γ )− 0.5] × h0,
ANOS(γ ) = ARL(γ )× n0
(18)
where P(γ ) is the probability of a sample standard deviation falling beyond the UCL. It is known that (n − 1)s2/σ 2 was a
chi-square distribution with (n− 1) degrees of freedom, and the probability P(γ ) is
P(γ ) =
∫ ∞
ς
u[(n0−1)/2]−1 exp(−u/2)
(2)ν/2Γ (ν/2)
du
where ς = (n0 − 1)(c4σ + kσ

1− c24 )2/(γ σ0)2; the k0 is the one that makes ARL(γ = 1) = 370.4.

Tukey’s chart uses a single observation to monitor the process mean, and it is suitable for monitoring of 
destructive testing data. Tukey’s chart adopts symmetrical control limits to monitor process and it is 
insensitive to signal mean shifts when the monitoring variable follows a skew distribution. This study 
proposes Tukey’s chart with asymmetrical control limits (ACL-Tukey’s chart) to monitor process mean. A 
statistical measurement performed with ACL-Tukey’s chart, improves successfully, the ability in 
signaling shifts for monitoring of right-skew and left-skew populations. A real case of IC packaging is 
given to illustrate the practice procedure of ACL-Tukey’s chart and indicates that ACL-Tukey’s chart is 
suitable to monitor the industrial process. 
 
Key words: Tukey’s control chart, destructive testing, skew distribution, IC packaging process, statistical 
process control. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Statistical process control (SPC) is the application of 
statistical methods to the monitoring and control of a 
process to ensure that it operates at its full potential to 
produce conforming product. The technology of control 
chart is a key tool in SPC. When an assignable cause 
occurs, the process will change. The control chart detects 
process changes and sends the operators to discover the 
assignable cause. 
Currently, there are many types of control charts; when 
the control chart is applied to control process, the 
selection of an appropriate control charts must consider 
several factors such as sampling methods and monitoring 
procedures, etc. Many electronics manufacturers utilize a 
destructive testing approach to measure the process 
observations. After destructive testing and inspection, the 
testing sample is destroyed and cannot be sold on the 
market. Generally, for this kind of process monitoring, only 
one sample is taken to measure the observation so as to 
reduce cost. In this way, individual control charts are 
suitable to monitor the destructive testing data. 
Tukey’s chart uses a single observation to monitor the 
process mean (Alemi, 2004; Torng and Lee, 2008; Torng 
et al., 2009), thus making it suitable for monitoring 
destructive testing data. Tukey’s chart has the advantage 
of easy and simple control limits setup, therefore, it can be  
adopted easily in real industry. Normal population is 
always a basic assumption of control charts, therefore, 
most control charts adopt symmetrical control limits to 
control the process. However, in real industry, process 
observation may violate this assumption and follows a 
skew distribution. Torng and Lee (2008) had presented 
that the performance of Tukey’s chart is similar to 
Shewhart chart under both normality and non-normality. 
The occurrence of an assignable cause may result in 
the positive or negative shift of the process mean. The 
performances of a control chart in detecting both positive 
and negative mean shifts are the same for symmetrical 
distributions, but it may be negative for skew distributions. 
If a control chart employs a sample of size larger than 30 
to monitor process, the sample distribution will be 
approximately normal based on central limit theorem 
without respect to the symmetrical or skew population. 
However, when the sample size n = 1 is employed on 
control charts, the central limit theorem is not adopted, 
and then, the sample taken from the skew population 
cannot follow a symmetrical distribution. It causes the 
performances of the Tukey’s chart to be different in the 
signaling of positive and negative shift. 
The skew distribution can be divided to left-skew and 
right-skew distributions. Torng and Lee (2008) presented

Where ( )δw  is the weight of ARL(δ). A small AARL 
value indicates the chart has good performance to signal 
the process variation. This study defines ( ) 2δδ =w . 
 
The control limit coefficients, kU and kL, must be 
determined before ACL-Tukey’s chart is applied to 
process control. This study constructs a design model to 
optimize the control limit coefficients, kU and kL. The 
standard Shewhart’s control charts were widely used to 
control process and their performance is as a criterion to 
measure the improving rate of performance of new control 
charts. The false alarm rate of a standard Shewhart’s 
chart is about 370.4, therefore, an in-control ARL value of 
370.4 is always used to be a common norm for comparing 
the performance (Balakrishnan et al., 2010; Torng and 
Lee, 2008). The constraint of this model limits in-control 
ARL to be 370.4, and its objective is to minimize the AARL. 
Therefore, this design model is:

Let kL be equal kU, the ACL-Tukey’s chart becomes 
SCL-Tukey’s chart. 
 
Matlab optimization toolbox applies a nonlinear 
constrained optimization algorithm for solving of nonlinear 
models. De Magalhães et al. (2001), Mahadik and Shirke 
(2009), Lee (2010) and Torng and Lee (2009) had used 
Matlab optimization toolbox to determine the parameters 
of control charts. The performance indicators ARL and 
AARL will be coded with Matlab R2007a, and optimization 
toolbox is then applied to solve the control limit 
coefficients, kU and kL. 
 
 
A COMPARATIVE STUDY 
 
Selection of the skew population 
 
The skew population can be divided into two types; 
left-skew and right-skew. Gamma distribution as a 
right-skew distribution, denoted by G (a,b), was always 
used to examine the performance of control charts. Torng 
and Lee (2008) presented the performance of 
SCL-Tukey’s chart under several gamma distribution 
assumptions. Weibull distribution, denoted by W (β, η), 
can also become left-skew or right-skew type with the 
change of its shape parameter. Let observation x follow a 
weibull distribution, and its pdf is:

Where η is a scale parameter; β is a shape parameter. If 0  
< β < 3, weibull distribution is right-skew type; weibull 
distribution of 3 ≤ β ≤ 4 is approximate for the symmetrical 
distribution, and when β > 4, weibull distribution will 
become left-skew type. The expected value and variance 
of weibull distribution presented thus:

This study selects gamma and weibull distributions to 
examine the performance of control charts. The 
parameter choice of gamma distribution refers Torng and 
Lee (2008), and they are G (4,1), G (2,1) and G (1,1). For 
weibull distribution, this study chooses β = 10, 5, 3.5, 2, 
0.8 and a fixed η = 1 to measure performance. Both W 
(10,1) and W (5,1) are left-skew distributions, W (3.5,1) is 
approximately a symmetrical distribution and W (2,1) and 
W (0.8,1) are right-skew distributions. Figure 1 shows the 
weibull distributions that were selected and their 
corresponding normal distributions that have the same 
mean and standard deviation. 
 
 
COMPARISON AND DISCUSSION 
 
A comparative study is conducted to evaluate the 
performance of both ACL-Tukey’s and SCL-Tukey’s 
charts. The false alarm rate of each chart is set to be 
equal, such that the comparison can be conducted in 
terms of the out-of-control ARL and AARL. The shifts of 
δ  = -3, -2, -1.5, -1, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 
1.5, 2 and 3 are chosen to obtain the out-of-control ARL 
and AARL values, so the τ of the design model is set at 3. 
The ARL and AARL calculations have been expressed in 
earlier discussion.  
Let SCL mean the SCL-Tukey’s chart and ACL indicate 
ACL-Tukey’s chart. Table 1 provides the optimal design 
parameters of both SCL and ACL performances for each 
population. The in-control ARL values of all control charts 
are the same. For right-skew populations (for example, G 
(4,1), G (2,1), G (1,1), W (2,1) and W (0.8,1)), SCL and 
ACL have the same performance in signaling positive 
mean shifts, but SCL is seriously insensitive to signal 
negative mean shifts. ACL has better ability in detecting 
negative mean shifts than in detecting positive mean 
shifts. When the population distribution is closing to 
symmetry (for example, W (3.5, 1)), SCL and ACL have 
similar ability, and their performances in detecting both 
positive and negative mean shifts are the same. If 
populations are left-skew distributions (for example, W 
(10,1) and W (5,1)), the performance of SCL is slightly 
better than the performance of ACL in signaling negative 
mean shifts, but the ability of ACL is conspicuously better 
than the ability of SCL in detecting positive mean shifts. To

APPLIED ACL-TUKEY’S CHART TO MONITOR 
WIRE BONDING PROCESS OF IC PACKAGING 
 
Wire bonding is a key process in IC packaging and 
is the most common method for electrically 
connecting the aluminum bonding  pads  on  a  
microchip surface to the package inner lead 
terminals on the lead-frame. Thermosonic ball 
bonding technology is applied to the wire bonding 
process. The thermosonic ball bonding uses a 
capillary tip made of tungsten carbide or ceramic 
material which feeds a fine diameter Au wire 
vertically through a hole in its center. The pro- 
truding wire is heated by a small flame or capacitor 
discharge spark, causing the wire to melt and form 
a ball at the tip. During bonding, the ultrasonic 
energy and the pressure cause a metallurgical 
bond to form between the Au wire and the Al pad. 
Upon completion of the ball bond, the bonding 
mechanism moves to the substrate inner lead pad 
and forms a thermo compression wedge bond. Up 
to this phase, the wire is broken and the tool 
continues to the next die bonding pad. 
During the wire bonding process, the  gold  ball

to carry out ACL-Tukey’s chart monitoring the industrial 
process. This case also verifies the good ability of 
ACL-Tukey’s chart in signaling shifts and SCL-Tukey’s 
chart is insensitive to signal shifts for monitoring the skew 
population. If the process observation follows a skew 
distribution, ACL-Tukey’s chart is suggested to monitor 
this process.

The design of DS X  control chart involves the

II. DS X  CONTROL CHART 
A. Principles of the DS X  control chart 
The DS X  control chart proposed by Daudin[10] 
integrated two Shewhart’s X  control charts with different 
widths of control limits for process monitoring and added 
warning limits in the first-stage control chart. The graphic 
view of the DS X  control chart is shown in Fig. 1 that the 
process observations are transformed to a standard normal 
distribution. Therefore, the central lines of control charts in 
two stages are 0. L1 and L2 are the width of control limits in 
the first-stage control chart and the second-stage control 
chart respectively. W is the width of warning limits in the 
first-stage control chart.

procedure of the DS X  control chart. First, take a small 
sample size, n1, and calculate the sample mean 1X . Then, 
calculate z using a normalize approach, that is,    11 Xnz . If z falls in I3, it will be considered as an 
out-of-control process. If z falls in I1, it will be deemed an in-
control process. For the case that z falls in I2, it is necessary 
to conduct a second-time sampling and monitor processes 
with the second-stage control chart. With the second-time 
sampling occurring, the sample size will be n2 (usually n1< n2) 
and the sample mean 
2X  for the second-time sampling needs 
to be calculated. Then, the total sample mean *X  for both 
sampling stages can be calculated with    212211* nnXnXnX  . 
Afterward, normalize value of *X  will be represented with z2,    Ynnz 212 . When z2 falls in I4, it will be considered as 
an in-control process. Otherwise, it will be regarded as an 
out-of-control process. 
 
B. DS X  chart under gamma distribution  
If the process observation x has a gamma distribution 
with parameters a and b, then its probability density function 
will be        0,  ,0   exp1   baxabbxxxf aa (1)
where    is a gamma function. Its mean and variance will 
be ab and ab2 respectively. The mean of a gamma 
distribution refers to ab and its variance is ab2. When the 
sample observations are gamma distribution, the sample 
mean X  of size n will also be gamma distribution as the 
parameters will be na and b/n. 
Torng & Lee[2] presented the error probabilities of type 
I and II for the DS X  chart under gamma distribution 
assumptions. Let X  be the mean of the sample size from a 
gamma distribution with a and b, when the process is in 
control, the probability that a sample mean

IV. CASE STUDY ON IC PACKAGING 
A. Wirebonding process of IC packaging 
Wirebonding is a key process in IC packaging and is 
the most common method for electrically connecting the 
aluminum bonding pads on a microchip surface to the 
package inner lead terminals on the lead-frame. 
Thermosonic ball bonding technology is applied to the 
wirebonding process. The thermosonic ball bonding uses a 
capillary tip made of tungsten carbide or ceramic material 
which feeds a fine diameter Au wire vertically through a 
hole in its center. The protruding wire is heated by a small 
flame or capacitor discharge spark, causing the wire to melt 
and form a ball at the tip. During bonding, the ultrasonic 
energy and the pressure cause a metallurgical bond to form 
between the Au wire and the Al pad. Upon completion of 
the ball bond, the bonding mechanism moves to the 
substrate inner lead pad and forms a thermocompression 
wedge bond. Up to this phase, the wire is broken and the 
tool continues to the next die bonding pad. 
During the wirebonding process, the gold ball shear 
strength is an important quality characteristic and must be 
monitored effectively to stabilize IC quality. The destructive 
testing approach is utilized to measure the ball shear 
strength. Since the ball shear strength variance of the same 
IC is very small, previous sampling approaches sampled 
several ICs and randomly selected one ball from each IC to 
perform testing. As a consequence, each IC will be 
destroyed after testing, and DS X  control chart is selected 
to monitor process mean for reduction of the cost. 
Since historical observations obtains 100 testing values 
of ball shear under in-control process, these testing values 
are verified following gamma distribution with 18.99a  
and 0.93b  through application of the Kolmogoroc-
Smirnov test (p-value = 0.377) under significance level of 
0.05. The process mean and standard deviation are 
respectively 17.66 (g) and 4.05. 
The cost parameters are as g=0.0167; 05.0 ; δ=2; 
0T =0.3333; D=1; a1=$1; a2=$0.1; a5=$25; 3a =$50 and 
a4=$100. We respectively apply Eq.(4), Eq.(7) and Eq.(8) to 
calculate the error probabilities, expected sample size and 
ARL values and then substitute above numerical and 
calculations of statistical indices into Eq.(13). Evolver is 
applied to solve the economic design model, and the 
parameter sets of Evolver are also the same values as Chen et 
al. [14]. The optimal parameters of DS X  control chart are

non-normal. Applying a Shewhart X  chart in a non-normal 
process monitoring increases the false alarms.  
The design of DS X  control chart involves the 
determination of the control limit coefficients, the sample 
size of two stages, the warning limit coefficient and the 
sampling interval. The process observation may follow a 
gamma distribution in the real industries. In this study, we 
construct an economic design model for a DS X  control 
chart under gamma distribution assumptions. The genetic 
algorithm is used to solve the economic design model and a 
sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effects of 
gamma distribution parameters on the optimal design of the 
DS X  control chart. 
 
 
II. DS X  CONTROL CHART 
A. Principles of the DS X  control chart 
The DS X  control chart proposed by Daudin[10] 
integrated two Shewhart’s X  control charts with different 
widths of control limits for process monitoring and added 
warning limits in the first-stage control chart. The graphic 
view of the DS X  control chart is shown in Fig. 1 that the 
process observations are transformed to a standard normal 
distribution. Therefore, the central lines of control charts in 
two stages are 0. L1 and L2 are the width of control limits in 
the first-stage control chart and the second-stage control 
chart respectively. W is the width of warning limits in the 
first-stage control chart. 
 
 
TABLE I.  GRAPHIC VIEW OF DS X  CONTROL CHART 
 
Under an assumption that process state is in control, 
each control region in Fig. 1 can be defined as  WWI ,1  , 
   112 W,L,-W-LI  ,     ,, 113 LLI   and  224 , LLI   
and     ,, 225 LLI  . 
Daudin[10] has explicitly illustrated the control  
procedure of the DS X  control chart. First, take a small 
sample size, n1, and calculate the sample mean 1X . Then, 
calculate z using a normalize approach, that is,    11 Xnz . If z falls in I3, it will be considered as an 
out-of-control process. If z falls in I1, it will be deemed an in-
control process. For the case that z falls in I2, it is necessary 
to conduct a second-time sampling and monitor processes 
with the second-stage control chart. With the second-time 
sampling occurring, the sample size will be n2 (usually n1< n2) 
and the sample mean 
2X  for the second-time sampling needs 
to be calculated. Then, the total sample mean *X  for both 
sampling stages can be calculated with    212211* nnXnXnX  . 
Afterward, normalize value of *X  will be represented with z2,    Ynnz 212 . When z2 falls in I4, it will be considered as 
an in-control process. Otherwise, it will be regarded as an 
out-of-control process. 
 
B. DS X  chart under gamma distribution  
If the process observation x has a gamma distribution 
with parameters a and b, then its probability density function 
will be        0,  ,0   exp1   baxabbxxxf aa (1)
where    is a gamma function. Its mean and variance will 
be ab and ab2 respectively. The mean of a gamma 
distribution refers to ab and its variance is ab2. When the 
sample observations are gamma distribution, the sample 
mean X  of size n will also be gamma distribution as the 
parameters will be na and b/n. 
Torng & Lee[2] presented the error probabilities of type 
I and II for the DS X  chart under gamma distribution 
assumptions. Let X  be the mean of the sample size from a 
gamma distribution with a and b, when the process is in 
control, the probability that a sample mean 
1X  in first stage 
chart falls respectively in I1 and I2 is as    1211211 nabWabXnabWabpIXp     121112 1

0T =0.3333; D=1; a1=$1; a2=$0.1; a5=$25; 3a =$50 and 
a4=$100. We respectively apply Eq.(4), Eq.(7) and Eq.(8) to 
calculate the error probabilities, expected sample size and 
ARL values and then substitute above numerical and 
calculations of statistical indices into Eq.(13). Evolver is 
applied to solve the economic design model, and the 
parameter sets of Evolver are also the same values as Chen et 
al. [14]. The optimal parameters of DS X  control chart are
