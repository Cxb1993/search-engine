Abstract 
 
This project is mainly to study the 
WDMPON dispersion compensation Raman 
amplifiers and transmission. We adopt 
bidirectional pumping scheme to minimize 
the effective NF by adjusting the ratio of the 
forward to backward pump power. Then, 
using a Faraday rotator mirror as the signal 
reflector make the signal double-pass DCF, 
which increases the pump efficiency and 
lowers the effective NF. The impact of DRB 
and SBS can not be ignored when high 
Raman gain is used. We have experimentally 
demonstrated 96 nm bandwidth Raman 
amplifiers with dispersion compensating 
fiber using six wavelengths pump laser diode 
unit. With a reflective type dispersion 
compensation Raman amplifier (DCRA) 
employing an optical circulator and a 
Faraday rotator mirror, it is shown that the 
gain is higher than that of the conventional 
single-pass type with the same dispersion 
compensation. Moreover, the noise figure of 
the reflective type DCRA is less than that of 
the single-pass DCRA at short wavelength, 
and the signal to DRB noise ratio of the 
reflective type is more than that of the 
single-pass type. 
We also demonstrated effective optical 
gain clamping for discrete Raman amplifier 
based on ring cavity technique using a fiber 
Bragg grating (FBG)-based all-optical 
 4
conventional single-pass type DCRA which 
provides dispersion D=-1325 ps/nm and 
D=-628 ps/nm at 15.4 km and 7.3 km DCF, 
respectively. Incorporates an acousto-optic 
modulator (AOM) and a isolator in the input, 
and a wavelength division multiplexing 
(WDM) coupler at output, allowing 
backward pumping. The signal is 
acoustic-optic modulator at 1 MHz to 
suppress the stimulated Brillouin scattering 
(SBS). The isolator can avoid the 
amplification of spurious reflections and 
control of double Rayleigh scattering. For the 
pumping units, we used six pump wavelength 
lasers of which the wavelengths are from 
1420 nm to 1510 nm. Each laser is stabilized 
by a fiber Bragg grating, and is orthogonal 
polarization with isolator polarization beam 
combiner (IPBC). The 16 channels WDM 
signals wavelengths are from 1527 nm to 
1623 nm. The input signal power of each 
channel is -10 and -20 dBm, respectively. 
Fig. 1(b) show the 7.3 km reflective 
type DCRA using forward pumping 
configuration. An optical circulator is placed 
between the isolator and the WDM coupler 
connected to one end of the 7.3 km DCF. A 
FRM at the other end of DCF reflects back 
the signals and survived the pump radiation 
into the amplifier fiber, resulting in increased 
gain and efficiency. The reflectivity of FRM 
is 89%. The FRM is designed to rotate a 
signal’s SOP by 45°, twice-once when the 
light enters, and again when the light is 
reflected back into the fiber. Since the 
Faraday Effect is non-reciprocal, the 
resultant SOP is rotated by 90° with respect 
to the original signal. 
 
五、結果與討論 
 
The pump wavelength is 1465 nm and 
input signal power is -10 dBm. Fig. 2 shows 
the measured net gain and noise figure of 
three different configurations at 1565 nm 
against pump power coupled into the DCF. 
Because the longer length DCF has large loss, 
net gain of the reflective type DCRA less 
than that of single-pass DCRA at smaller 
pump power. The net gain of reflective type 
DCRA is more than that of 15.4 km 
single-pass DCRA 10.88 dB at pump power 
of 310 mW. From this result we know the 
reflective type DCRA can increase the gain 
and decrease the noise figure with the same 
dispersion compensation. 
The pump power are 496, 406, 100, 130, 
80 and 52 mW for the wavelength of 1420, 
1435, 1450, 1465, 1480 and 1510 nm, 
respectively. Fig. 3 shows the measured net 
gain and noise figure of 7.3 km single-pass 
DCRA. The solid lines represent net gain and 
the dot lines represent noise figure value. The 
lines with square and circular represent the 
input signal powers of -10 and -20 dBm, 
respectively. The gain bandwidth can attain 
96 nm from 1527 nm to 1623 nm and the 
gain flatten is 1.29 dB. The net gain at 
wavelength 1605 nm are 14.96 and 15.7 dB 
for the -10 and -20 dBm input signal power, 
respectively. 7.3 km DCF only compensate 
dispersion for 40 km of standard single mode 
fiber, therefore we increased two times of 
DCF length up to 15.4 km in Fig. 1(a) 
configuration. The pump power is similar to 
7.3 km single-pass DCRA, and the results 
can be seen in Fig. 4. The net gains at 
wavelength 1605 nm are 15.84 and 17.53 dB 
for the -10 and -20 dBm input signal power, 
respectively. The gain flatten is 1.85 dB. The 
noise figure of the 15.4 km single-pass is 
2.33 dB more than that of 7.3 km single-pass 
at 1527 nm with input signal power of -10 
dBm. Even though the 15.4 km single-pass 
type can compensate dispersion of 80 km 
standard single mode fiber, the noise figure 
increases at shorter wavelengths of the signal 
and the net gain are slightly not enough to 
compensate loss. 
We employed an optical circulator and a 
FRM reflects back the signals and survived 
the pump radiation into the amplifier fiber. 
The results of 7.3 km reflective type DCRA 
are shown in Fig. 5. The 7.3 km DCF can 
compensation dispersion the same as 15.4 km 
single-pass DCRA, and furthermore the net 
gain is more than the 15.4 km single-pass 
DCRA 1.94 dB at 1605 nm with input signal 
power of -10 dBm. The net gain at the 
wavelength 1605 nm are 17.78 and 19.02 dB 
for the -10 and -20 dBm input signal power, 
respectively. The noise figure is less than 
that of the single-pass DCRA at short 
wavelengths. The noise figure flatten of
