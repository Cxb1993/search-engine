approximation of the nonlinear resonant sloshing in a rectangular tank with a small 
fluid depth. More recently Faltinsen, Rognebakke, and Timokha (2003) extended their 
asymptotic modal system to model nonlinear sloshing in a 3D rectangular tank. 
 
Besides the potential flow approaches, many numerical studies of the problem with 
primitive variables have been made, particularly when the fully nonlinear effects of 
the waves on the free surface are included. Papers that describe the modeling of 
two-dimensional sloshing include Chen and Chiang (1999) Celebi & Akyuldiz (2002), 
Sames, Marcouly and Schellin (2002), Aliabadi, Johnson & Abedi (2003) and more 
recent papers by Frandsen (2004), Chen (2005) and Chen and Nokes (2005). Detailed 
surveys have been given by Ibrahim, Pilipchuk and Ikeda (2001), who provide general 
insight into sloshing problems, and by Cariou and Casella (1999) who review 
commercial codes. The advantages and disadvantages of various computational fluid 
dynamics (CFD) methods are compared in the ISSC Report (1997), and Ibrahim et 
al.(2001).  
 
Hit and Nichols (1981) developed a method known as the volume of fluid (VOF) 
method which allows a steep, and highly contorted, free surface. Celebi and Akyuldiz 
(2002) used the VOF technique to develop a viscous solver in order to capture the free 
surface nonlinear flow. They simulated 2-D sloshing motion in a tank with, or without, 
baffles, and the tank was forced to move harmonically along a vertical curve with 
rolling motion. Chen, Haroun and Liu (1996) and Turnbull, Borthwick and Eatock 
Taylor (2003) simulated fluid sloshing in a 2-D tank. The fluid was inviscid and the 
tank was excited under horizontal motion. They used simple σ - transformed 
mappings in pseudo-spectral and finite element schemes to solve for the free surface 
motion near the resonant frequency. Kim (2001) used the finite difference method to 
simulate two and three dimensional liquid containers with, or without, internal 
members. He used the SOLA scheme to obtain a solution of the Navier–Stokes 
equations with a free surface. The free surface profile was assumed to be a 
single-valued function (SURF scheme) and the free-slip condition was applied in his 
computations.  
 
Frandsen (2004) developed a fully nonlinear finite difference model based on the 
inviscid flow equations. He described the sloshing motion in a 2-D wave tank based 
 2
only on the acceleration amplitude of excitation ( , : excitation amplitude in 
the vertical direction; 
2
zzx ω zx
:zω the excitation frequency of heave motion). Faltinsen et al. 
(2000) used multidimensional modal analysis to describe the transient behavior of the 
resonant waves. They also included damping in their analysis. They presented the 
steady-state amplitude-frequency response for surge- and pitch-excited waves and this 
was consistent with the third- and fifth-order steady state solutions of Faltinsen (1974) 
and Waterhouse (1994) respectively. Moreover, turning or bifurcation points of the 
amplitude-frequency response were identified in their studies, although the turning 
points of the amplitude-frequency response were from their steady-state solutions.  
 
Hill (2003) developed a multiple-scale analysis to derive an evolution equation for the 
complex amplitude of resonant waves, but this approach is invalid in the vicinity of 
the “critical depth” and in the shallow –water limit. He used the shallow water 
equations to modify the results and compared these with experimental data which 
showed good agreement. The numerical wave tank, with near resonant frequency 
excitation, was considered with different depth/length ratios, including the critical 
depth, and the results were compared to previous experimental and analytic work. Hill 
also demonstrated the difference between transient and steady-state responses, and 
concluded that the bifurcation point of the transient response can occur at a larger 
value of detuning (detuning = 1 1| | / ,ω ω ω ω− : the forcing frequency; :1ω the first 
natural frequency) than for the steady-state response. Damping also has an important 
effect on the amplitude-frequency response. In Hill’s study he found that the 
bifurcation points vanish altogether at certain large damping values and the 
amplitude-frequency response becomes single-valued for all detuning.  
 
Faltinsen and Timokha (2001) created an adaptive multimodal approach to nonlinear 
sloshing in a rectangular tank. Adaptive procedures were established for a wide range 
of excitation periods provided the mean fluid depth, h, was larger than 0.25 times the 
tank breadth. Steady-state results for wave elevation, horizontal force and pitch 
moment were experimentally validated, except when heavy roof impact occurred. 
Their theory is invalid when either the water depth is small, or water impacts heavily 
on the tank ceiling. Faltinsen et al. (2003) derived an asymptotic modal system for 
modeling nonlinear sloshing in a 3D rectangular tank. The tank was forced in a 
surge/sway mode with a frequency close to the lowest degenerate natural frequency.

vehicles moving liquid cargo (Hill 2003, Chen and Nokes 2005). During earthquakes, 
the transient sloshing waves may cause large pressures, and moments, on structures 
that are considerably more important than those due to steady-state waves. Hill (2003) 
presented a weakly-nonlinear analysis of the transient evolution of two-dimensional, 
standing waves in a rectangular tank. One of his results compared the transient waves 
with the steady-state waves and showed that the maximum transient response of a 
basin set into motion from rest can far exceed the steady-state response of the basin. 
In recent measurements by Faltinsen et al. (2003), their experiments lasted for about 
120 forcing periods and clear steady-state regimes were not achieved during this time. 
The transient behaviour during the first 80 seconds changed between being dominated 
by ‘planar/diagonal’, ‘square’ and ‘swirling’ wave modes. The largest displacements 
during a major earthquake typically occur within the first 60 seconds, and therefore a 
knowledge of the transient response of a fluid reservoir may be crucial for 
engineering purposes.  
 
1.5 Faraday waves 
 
The above analyses were primarily for tanks excited by translational oscillations. 
Vertical excitation was not considered. As we know, a liquid container, or reservoir, 
undergoing earthquake excitation, or a liquid container on a ship, is subject to forcing 
that comprises both horizontal and vertical oscillations. Faraday (1831) studied the 
sloshing instability in vertically oscillating containers, known as faraday waves, and 
found it had a parametric instability. Benjamin and Ursell (1954) investigated the 
vertical motion theoretically, and concluded that the solutions obtained from the 
Mathieu equation were always unstable for an external forcing frequency equal to 
twice the fundamental natural frequency. Wu et al.(1998) found that under vertical 
oscillation, the motion of the free surface is not at the excitation frequency, but at the 
first natural frequency of the tank, and the wave evolution during the transient period 
may be determined only from the acceleration amplitude of the excitation.  
 
Heave motion, coupled with surge or pitch motion, has been discussed in recent years. 
Frandsen (2004) coupled surge and heave motion and found that vertical excitation 
caused the instability associated with parametric resonance of the combined motion 
for a certain set of frequencies and amplitudes of vertical motion, while the horizontal 
motion was related to classical resonances. Hengliang and Chin (2004) presented an 
implicit, three-dimensional, fully non-hydrostatic model to solve for the free surface 
motion. The method was based upon a staggered finite difference Crank-Nicholson

this study. Although the governing equations incorporate excitations with six degrees 
of freedom, only surge, sway and heave motions are included in the simulations 
presented here. Section 5 summarizes the key conclusions.

2.2 Boundary conditions 
 
2.2.1 Free surface boundary conditions 
 
As we know, the most difficult problem of the simulation of 3D flow is the treatment 
of the surface due to it varies temporally and spatially. There are five unknowns at the 
free surface are its location changing with time, the hydrodynamic pressure and three 
velocity components (u, v, w). The boundary conditions that must be satisfied at the 
free surface are the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions. The 
kinematic condition states the fluid particles at a free surface remain on free surface, 
and can be expressed as

where h is wave elevation. 
 
The dynamic condition requires that the normal stress is equal to the atmospheric 
pressure and the two tangential stresses are zero along the free surface boundary. The 
dynamic conditions can be expressed as following:

In the present study, Eq. (2-14) is used to determine the hydrodynamic pressure at the 
free surface, while Eqs. (2-15) and (2-16) are used to extrapolate the horizontal 
velocity (u, w) at the free surface from the flow dom

2.3   Coordinate transformation  
 
Many finite difference and volume methods have been reported to solve the free 
surface displacement of sloshing fluid in tanks. Among these methods, SURF, MAC 
and VOF are the most well-known. A brief review of these methods can be found in 
Chen and Nokes (2005). The σ-transformation is also frequently used in treating time 
varying free surface flows (see Phillips 1957, Mellor and Blumberg 1985 and 
Frandsen 2004). In contrast, the present study uses simple mapping functions to 
urface of the fluid domain. The irregular 
oundary, including the time-varying fluid surface, non-vertical walls and 
remove the time-dependence of the free s
b
non-horizontal bottom, can be mapped onto a cube by the proper coordinate 
transformations (Hung and Wang 1987, Hung and Chen, 1990, and Chern et al. 1999) 
as follows:

transformed to a fixed unit cubic domain. The main advantage of these 
transformations is to map a wavy and time-dependent fluid domain onto a 
time-independent unit cubic domain. In this way re-meshing due to the wavy free 
surface is unnecessary. In addition, the ma ping im licitly deals with the free surface 
motion, and avoids the need to calculate the free surface velocity components 
explicitly. Extrapolations are unnecessary, and free surface smoothing by m  of a 
spatial filter is not required.

Chapter 3 Computational Algorithm 
 
In this three-dimensional analysis, the fluid flow is solved in a unit cubic mesh in the 
transformed flow domain. All computations use the dimensionless equations in the 
X-Y-Z coordinate system. Central difference approximations are used for the space 
derivatives, except at the boundary where forward or backward differences are 
employed. A staggered grid system is used in the analysis. That is, the pressure P is 
defined at the centre of a finite difference grid cell (of dimensions ( ), ,X Y ZΔ Δ Δ

), 
whereas the velocity components U, V and W are calculated ,  and 
 behind, above or backward of the cell centre. This convention is illustrated in

The Crank-Nicholson second order finite difference scheme and the Gauss-Seidel 
point successive over-relaxation iterative procedure are used to calculate the velocity 
and pressure, respectively. The numerical scheme is described below. When the 
dimensionless momentum equations (equations (2-18), (A-1), (A-2)) are considered to

frequency with respect to roll, pitch and yaw motion. We assume the tank’s motion is 
combination of Surge-Sway motion that indicates it vibrates in the diagonal direction. 
The ratio of the excitation displacement / breadth = a0 / L = 0.0025.  
 
     We set the grid numbers in x, y, z direction is L1, M1, N1, respectively. The 
cases with different combinations of grid numbers and time step are listed in Table 3.1 
for inviscid fluid. The excitation frequency is fixed to 0.9 1ω . The wave history on the 
tank’s corner of the cases c1~c7 are shown in Fig. 3.2. Fig. 3.2 (a) presents the 
changing of grid numbers with the fixed time step 0.001 sec. It shows the results of 
case c2, c3 and c4 match very well and a little different with c1. This result indicates 
the influence of changing grid numbers under the fixed time step 0.001 sec for the 
computational result can be neglected. Fig. 3.2 (b) presents the changing time step 
with fixed grid numbers. It shows the results of case c3 and c7 are almost the same, 
but the other cases c5 and c6 are different. This means the influence of different time 
steps for computational result should be considered. As a result, according to the 
condition of stability and the verification of the influence of grid numbers and time 
steps, the calculated parameter in the present numerical scheme is chosen as the case 
of c3 ( XΔ = ZΔ = 0.025, YΔ = 0.05, TΔ = 0.001) in order to get more accurate results 
in present work. However, if the ratio of geometry of the tank or the amplitude of 
sloshing wave (becomes more large) is changed, an appropriate grid system and time 
step will be change, too. Moreover, if we take viscous fluid into account, the refined 
grids are used into calculation. Thus, the grid sizes are changed to XΔ = ZΔ = 
0.01, YΔ = 0.02 in the present numerical scheme.

3.5 Set-up of PC-Cluster Workstation 
 
It is widely known that numerically solving the unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes equations 
for 3D fluid flows requires a large amount of numerical grids. Therefore, a huge 
memory and a long-term computational time are needed. If we want to realize the 
flow phenomena caused by the boundary layer near the walls, the refined grids close 
to the walls are indispensable. However, it is more difficult to use one single 
computer to handle with these problems.  
 
In general, the methods to solve the problems mentioned above are by using a 
supercomputer or parallelizing the computer program and running the parallel code on 
a PC-cluster workstation linked with several single PC together. In the present study, 
a PC-cluster installed Linux system are formed by 16 single computers and MPI 
(Message-Passing Interface) parallel language and MPICH2 software are used to 
carry out the computation. MPICH2 is an implementation of the Message-Passing 
Interface (MPI). The goals of MPICH2 are to provide an MPI implementation for 
important platforms, including clusters, SMPs, and massively parallel processors. It 
also provides a vehicle for MPI implementation research and for developing new and 
better parallel programming environments MPICH2 is distributed as source (with an 
open-source, freely available license). It has been tested on several platforms, 
including Linux (on IA32 and x86-64), Mac OS/X (PowerPC and Intel), Solaris (32- 
and 64-bit), and Windows. More detailed information of MPICH2 can be get on the 
website ‘http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/’. In the present work, we apply 
MPICH2 on Linux system because it can calculate faster than on Windows system.

4.2   Horizontal ground motion 
 
For practical engineering applications, for example a tank excited by a real earthquake, 
the ground motion will be a complex combination of surge, sway, heave, pitch, yaw 
and roll. Initially, if we focus on the horizontal excitation only, the tank, in general, 
would not be excited exactly in either the surge (x-) or sway (z-) directions, but rather 
it will be a coupled surge and sway motion, and the excitation direction may vary with 
time. In this work, we define θ as the excitation angle of the horizontal ground motion. 
For longitudinal excitation, surge motion with θ = 0o, Faltinsen et al. (2003) reported 
four different kinds of waves – planar waves (ωx/ω1 = 0.92; h = 0.508), swirling 
waves (ωx/ω1 = 1.011), irregular waves (ωx/ω1 = 0.945) and square-like waves (ωx/ω1 
= 0.98). Here ωx is the excitation frequency of longitudinal excitation and ω1 = ω1,0 
from equation 4.1. When the tank was excited by diagonal motion (θ = 45o), the same 
four kinds of waves might be expected, but the stable square-like waves and swirling 
waves were seldom seen in their experimental measurements. Visual observations 
made by Faltinsen et al (2003) showed that three dimensional waves are observed 
only when the tank was under near resonant excitation. When the excitation was away 
from the lowest natural frequency, the sloshing responses were basically 
two-dimensional longitudinal excitation or diagonal sloshing (under diagonal 
excitation). In the present study, horizontal excitations with various excitation angles, 
and a wide range of excitation frequencies, are simulated. The excitation angles used 
in the study are θ = 0o (longitudinal excitation), 5o, 10o, 15o, 30o and 45o (diagonal 
excitation).  
 
In this section, the tank is excited by surge-sway motion with various excitation 
frequencies. The tank is rigid with a square base and an undisturbed fluid depth of 
do/L = 0.25. The amplitude of the ground displacement is 0.005 L. The spectral 
analysis of a typical earthquake record (921 Chi-Chi earthquake, Taiwan 1999), 
presented in figure 4.5, indicates that the majority of the energy resides within the 
frequency range of 0.2 ω1 to 2.5 ω1. Therefore, in the present study, excitation 
frequencies from 0.2 1ω  to 2.3 1ω are used. The different types of sloshing wave that 
arise with different excitation frequencies and excitation angles are discussed 
separately in the following subsections. 
 
 
 
 
 
 34
However, as the tank is accelerated at other angles, the diagonal wave no longer 
occurs. Instead, the waves are found to slosh in the same direction as the excitation 
motion. We can define this type of wave as a ‘single-directional’ wave. The sloshing 
histories of surface displacement at points A, C and E are plotted in Fig. 4.8(b) and 
the wave histories of sloshing displacement at point E vs. point F is shown in Fig. 
4.8(a). As shown in Fig. 4.8(b), the relationship between sloshing displacements at 
points E and F are also perfectly linear that implies the sloshing wave traveling in a 
fixed sense (direction). The surface wave profile of four walls vs. time is depicted in 
Fig. 4.8(c), the upper four panels are those of excited angle = 5o and the lower two 
pairs are those of excited angle = 15o and 30o respectively. The sloshing displacement 
of point A (and D) shows standing wave like oscillation and double troughs and peaks 
occur during the half cycles before and after the odd cycles of the sloshing. The 
double peaks (troughs) might be attributed to the excitation frequency (= 0.4 ω1) and 
the phenomena also occur for the other cases with same excitation frequency.  
 
As shown in the surface profiles, when the excited angle is only 5o shift from the 
surge direction (x-direction), the amplitude of the wave displacements along wall W1 
(and W2) are about the same and they also likely show the standing wave profile with 
time. The time-histories of surface displacement at points A and C are nearly 
anti-symmetric and the sloshing displacement at point D is a little bit smaller than 
those at points A and C, and the histories of surface displacement at points E and G 
are negligible small and they are also omitted in the figure. As a matter of fact, for 
excited angle = θ, the components of the forcing functions in surge and sway direction 
are, respectively, a0 cos θ and a0 sin θ. The contribution of sway component to fluid 
boundary along I-A-E is a bonus, while to fluid boundary along E-B-F is actually a 
reduction. This phenomenon is more significant for larger excited angle. For excited 
angle = 5o, the surface displacement along wall W1 becomes inclined. The sloshing 
displacement along wall W3 remains nearly flat between points E and B when the 
excited angle = 30o.  
 
Figure 4.9 presents the surface contour profiles of single-directional waves 
withvarious excitation angles, and a fixed excitation frequency of 0.4 1ω . The 
single-directional waves have been reported in the literature but all the earlier studies 
have been limited to a tank undergoing longitudinal forcing (surge θ = 0o) or diagonal 
forcing (θ = 45o). The free surface sloshing profiles of diagonal waves and 
single-directional waves are shown in Fig. 4.10 and Fig. 4.11, respectively.

4.2.3  Irregular waves 
 
Waves that slosh irregularly inside the tank are termed irregular or chaotic waves. 
Irregular waves have been predicted when the excitation frequency lies within a tight 
band around the first natural frequency, although they were not observed in the 
experimental measurements of Faltinsen et al. (2006). In this study irregular waves 
could be found when the tank is excited by frequencies outside this limited range. 
Figure 4.17 presents the results of a tank accelerated with an excitation angle of 
and an excitation frequency of 2.3o5=θ  1ω . As can be seen in figure 4.17(c), the 
nal line but are scattered at various 
locations within the tank. With the same excitation frequency, figure 4.18 shows the 
distribution of the absolute peaks of irregular waves with various excitation angles. It 
appears that the irregular waves are not affected significantly by the excitation angle, 
but that they are influenced by the dominant excitation frequency mingling with 
natural modes of the system. A spectral analysis of the sloshing displacements 
demonstrates the influence of the excitation frequency and the fundamental modes of 
the system, and details of such an analysis will be presented in section 4.2.5.  
 
sloshing peaks are not gathered along the diago
he surface profiles of an excited angle = 5o are shown in Fig 4.19(a) and the lower T
four are surface profiles (Fig 4.19(b)) of an exited angle = 45o. For an excited angle = 
5o, the surface profiles along walls W1 and W2 are similar to those of planar wave (2D 
sloshing tank), while the irregular wave patterns are found along walls W3 and W4. 
The surface displacements along four walls all show irregular pattern when the 
excited angle increases to 45o. The free surface sloshing profiles of irregular waves 
are shown in Fig. 4-20.

switches direction at around T = 120. Another interesting observation is that the larger 
absolute wave peaks concentrate in the four corners of the tank. As the waves travel in 
a counter-clockwise direction, the maximum sloshing displacement occurs at corners 
A and C of the tank (see figure 1). When the swirling changes direction to clockwise, 
the maximum displacement occurs at corners B and D. The sloshing histories shown 
in figures 4.21(a) and 4.22 confirm the above observation. To discover the possible 
reason for the direction switching, we correlated the tank displacement and the wave 
elevation, as shown in figure 4.23. As the tank’s displacement is positive/negative, the 
water elevation at the wall will be raised/lowered and this phenomenon can be seen in 
figure 23(a) (T = 30 - 50). However, figure 23(b) (T = 110 - 130) shows quite 
different behavior in that a phase lag exists between the motion of the swirling waves 
and the motion of the tank system. This phase lag might be related to the direction 
switching of the swirling waves. Note that, this phase lag phenomenon does not exist 
in other kinds of sloshing waves. 
 
We also consider response of the tank excited at a fixed frequency, 1.05 1ω , but with 
different excitation angles. Figure 4.24 presents the distribution of absolute peaks. For 
the case of , the swirling waves are insignificant when compared to the 
results for the other angles. Figure 4.25 shows the absolute peaks for a tank excited at 
 but now with an excitation frequency ranging from 1
o45=θ
o10=θ  0.95 ω to 1.08 1ω . 
 swirling pattern occurs in all simulations, and the excita  frequency range 
is larger than that reported by Faltinsen et al (2003) whose tank was under diagonal or 
longitudinal forcing. The excitation frequency range is, however, close to the 
predicted range of the analysis of Faltinsen et al (2006), although their tank base is not 
exactly square and they assume that the base ratio perturbation would affect the 
sloshing phenomenon. In the present study, we also find that the excitation angle has a 
significant effect on the sloshing behavior of the fluid in the tank. 
 
Clearly a tion
igure 4.26 shows the wave profiles of swirling waves along four walls. From T = 0 F
to 80, the sloshing displacement at point A are rising. As the amplitude of the 
displacement of point A increases to a significant amount, the counterclockwise 
swirling starts around T = 40. After T = 80, the sloshing displacement at point A 
begins decreasing and the swirling phenomenon diminishing until the displacement of 
point D increases to the other significant amount around T = 180 and the clockwise 
swirling occurs. The surface profiles of wall W3 and W4 clearly demonstrate the said 
phenomenon. The peak amplitude of the sloshing displacement at point A is larger 
than that at point D during counterclockwise swirling, while that phenomenon is 
contrary during clockwise swirling. The maximum and minimum amplitudes of

4.2.5  Spectral analysis 
 
In this section, a spectral analysis is performed in an attempt to identify the dominant 
frequencies for each type of sloshing wave. As the tank is excited under an excitation 
frequency close to the first natural frequency of the tank, the resultant phenomenon is 
called ‘the primary resonance’ of the tank. When the excitation frequency is moved 
away from the first natural frequency of the system, a secondary resonance might also 
be triggered due to a contribution of other natural modes of the system.  
 
Figure 4.29 presents the wave elevation and the corresponding spectral analyses of 
single-directional waves forced far from the first natural mode, ω = 0.4 1ω . The 
resulting motion is dominated by two frequencies, one near the primary resonance 
(1.02 1ω ) and the other near the excitation frequency (0.42 1ω ). Figure 4.30 presents 
the results of square-like waves for a tank forced at ω = 1.5 1ω . Aside from the peaks 
at the primary resonance (1.02 1ω ) and excitation frequency (1.53 1ω ), two natural 
modes, ω3,0 and ω4,0 are also present, although they contain little energy. Thus, for 
diagonal, single direction and square-like waves, the major response frequencies are 
the first fundamental frequency and the excitation frequency. 
 
Figures 4.30 and 4.31 show the spectral analysis for swirling waves in a tank forced at 
ω = 0.97 1ω and ω = 1.04 1ω respectively. The figures clearly show resonance peaks 
corresponding to the primary natural frequency, and also 2ω1,0 which is slightly 
smaller than the natural frequency ω2,2. The spectral analyses of swirling waves 
consistently show the occurrence of a resonance peak corresponding to ω2,2 , and this 
secondary resonance may be related to the development of the swirling wave in the 
tank. This finding will be validated with more simulation examples presented in later 
sections. 
 
Figure 4.33 depicts the spectral analysis of irregular waves sloshing in a tank 
accelerated by an excitation frequency of 1.8 ω1,0. In addition to the primary 
resonance and a peak corresponding to the excitation frequency, there is another 
resonant peak attributed to the odd natural mode ω3,0. Figure 4.34 plots the spectral 
analysis for a tank sloshing with an excitation angle of 45o, and an excitation 
frequency of 2.3 ω1, and in this case not only is the resonant peak ω3,0 observed, but a 
peak corresponding to ω5,0 is also present. It appears to be common for the occurrence 
of irregular waves to be related to the appearance of odd natural mode responses.

4.39 and 4.40) show that the resonant peaks vary with the excitation angle and the 
sloshing displacement at point E is quite related to the excitation angle. Since the 
excitation amplitude in the z-direction (sway direction) increases with the excitation 
angle, and point E is in the sway direction, the sloshing displacement at point E, 
therefore, increases with the excitation angle.  
 
The wave histories at points E and F for swirling waves are shown in figure 4.41(a) 
and (b). Under near resonance excitation, the occurrence of the swirling is clearly 
affected by the excitation angle of the horizontal ground motion. Figures 30(c)-(g) 
present the relationship of sloshing displacements at points E and F for the tank 
excited at various angles. For the case of θ = , the sloshing displacement at the 
corners of the tank (points A and C) ultimately become greater than twice the water 
depth, ,  and unrealistic wave heights occur after T=60, so the simulations are 
stopped at T = 60. As shown in figures 30(c)-(g), the swirling phenomenon for the 
case
o45

θ = is obvious, and both clear counterclockwise and clockwise swirling are 
present. The swirling behaviour is small once 
o5
θ  is larger than , and it has 
essentially disappeared by 
o30
θ = , at least for times up to T = 60. The swirling 
waves are very difficult to generate when the tank is excited by nearly diagonal 
forcing.

4.2.7  Classification of sloshing waves  
 
Faltinsen et al (2005(b)) provided an extensive experimental dataset which they were 
able to compare with the results from their adaptive asymptotic theory. They classified 
the sloshing waves into a number of categories: namely planar, diagonal, chaotic and 
swirling waves. Although the transient responses were measured in their experimental 
investigation, the steady state responses are the major focus in most of their published 
articles. The excitation frequencies in their studies were limited to the range from 0.6 
ω1 to 1.2 ω1 and near primary resonance excitation was investigated in detail.  
 
In this study, simulations under a broader range of excitation frequencies and 
excitation angles have been performed. We have extended the range of excitation 
frequencies from 0.2 ω1 to 2.3ω1, and in addition to longitudinal forcing and diagonal 
forcing, four different excitation angles have been analysed. The classification of the 
sloshing waves in the present study, for a tank excited in horizontal motion with 
various excitation angles and frequencies, is illustrated in figures 4.42 to 4.46. In the 
most recent paper of Faltinsen et al. (2006), the chaotic waves predicted by their 
analytical model are found within a small excitation frequency range, but these waves 
were not observed in their experiments. Chaotic waves were successfully simulated in 
the present study, even in a diagonal forcing case, for an excitation frequency within 
the same range as that of Faltinsen’s studies. However, chaotic waves are also found 
in other simulations where the excitation frequency is away from the first fundamental 
mode and lies within the range of 1.6 to 2.3 ω1. The range of excitation frequencies in 
which swirling waves are observed is 0.9 to 1.1ω1 when the excitation angle is less 
than 30o. The range of excitation frequency for swirling waves shrinks to a very 
narrow band when the tank is under diagonal forcing. This classification is in very 
good agreement with that of Faltinsen. We can find from figures 4.42 to 4.46 that one 
kind of sloshing wave, which we name swirling-like waves, appears within a certain 
range of excitation frequency. The swirling-like waves occur before and after the 
range of the excitation frequency of swirling waves and their behavior exhibits 
swirling motion within a limited domain within the tank, as shown in Fig 4.47. This 
kind of sloshing wave isn’t discussed in detail for a tank under horizontal forcing. 
However, the effect of heave motion on swirling-like waves will be presented in detail 
in section 4.3.4.

corresponding to the first natural frequency increases when the heave motion is added 
to the excitation of the tank. For the case of heave motion starting at T = 40, the 
resonant peak is a little bit larger than that for heave motion starting from T = 0. Thus, 
if the horizontal forcing frequency is near the resonant frequency of the tank, the 
effect of heave motion ( 12yω ω= ) will influence the sloshing system more rapidly 
due to the increasing intensity of the first mode of natural frequency. On the other 
hand, if the horizontal forcing frequency is far from the resonant frequency of the tank 
as seen in Fig. 4.50, the influence of heave motion is not discerned until T~200. 
 
Figure 4.51 shows the results of a tank excited by coupled surge-sway-heave motion 
with various vertical excitation displacements. The free surface in the tank is initially 
undisturbed, and the heave motion starts at T = 40 for all cases. As illustrated in the 
figure, the destabilising influence of the heave motion is clearly noticeable for the 
largest amplitudes, and violent sloshing starts much earlier than that for a tank under 
surge-sway excitation only. The simulation results diverged at T=85 and 190 for 
y0/L=0.01 and y0/L=0.005, respectively. For the smallest vertical excitation amplitude, 
y0/L = 0.002, the influence of heave motion is not obvious. Thus, in the following 
sections, the vertical displacement (y0) is chosen to be 0.005L for all of the simulated 
cases.

4.3.2  Effect of heave motion on single-directional or diagonal waves 
 
Figure 4.52 depicts the heave motion effect on single-directional waves. As shown in 
the Fig. 4.52(a), the influence of the heave motion starts to become significant at 
around T = 400. The sloshing wave pattern switches from single–directional waves 
into counter clockwise swirling waves once the heave motion begins to have an effect, 
as can be seen in figures 4.52(a) and (b). A spectral analysis (Fig 4.52(c) and (d)) 
exhibits two peaks corresponding to 0.5 ω1, the excitation frequency, and 1.0ω1, the 
first fundamental frequency early in the time history (T < 300). Whereas, after T = 
400, when the impact of the heave motion appears, the spectral analysis shows the 
rapid growth of the peak at the natural frequency and the appearance of a second peak 
at 2.05 ω1. At these later times the magnitude of the peak corresponding to the 
excitation frequency is negligible when compared to those of the other modes. As 
stated in the previous section, the resonant peak corresponding to ω2,2 = 2.05 ω1 might 
be related to the occurrence of swirling waves. Thus, the addition of a heave motion 
to the coupled surge-sway motion can generate resonant sloshing at a frequency of 
ω2,2 and change the sloshing pattern from single-direction waves to swirling waves.   
 
The effect of heave motion on diagonal waves can be seen in figure 4.53. The obvious 
influence of heave motion starts after T=300, but it is clear from figures 4.53(a) and 
(b) that in this case the wave pattern does not switch to a swirling wave pattern during 
the time before the wave heights become too large to continue the numerical

4.3.4  Effect of heave motion on swirling-like waves 
 
For excitation angle , the swirling-like waves occur when the excitation 
frequencies are within a range of 
5oθ =
10.9 ~ 0.95ω ω= .
 all the tank w
 For a swirling wave pattern, the 
distribution of a swirling-like wave show the peaks are basically scattered along part 
of the tank walls AB and CD (see Fig 4.47). However while the highest sloshing 
displacements clearly occur in the corner for the case of swirling waves (see Fig 4.21), 
for swirling-like waves the location of the highest sloshing displacements is not 
obvious. The effect of heave motion on swirling-like waves is illustrated in figure 
4.55. Figure 4.55 (a) provides a comparison between the free surface motion at point 
A when the tank is excited by surge-sway only, and when it is excited by 
heave-surge-sway motion. The effect, beginning at around T = 270, is substantial. 
Figures 4.55 (b) and (c) indicate that the heave motion eventually converts the 
swirling-like motion into true swirling waves. Figure 4.56 depicts the repeated 
switching of swirling direction – a phenomenon that does not occur when the tank is 
excited by horizontal motion with an excitation frequency equal to 0.9ω1. This switch 
in swirling direction only occurs when the tank is excited by surge-sway motion with 
an excitation frequency close to the first mode. The time duration of clockwise and 
counterclockwise swirling is shorter when the heave excitation is included in the tank 
motion. This increased switching frequency may cause the instability of vehicles 
carrying tanks of fluid. The spectral analysis of the sloshing displacement of fluid in a 
tank excited by coupled heave-surge-sway motion is shown in figure 4.56 (b)-(e). Two 
peaks corresponding to the forcing frequency, 0.9ω1, and the natural frequency, 1.0ω1, 
occur when T = 0 ~ 240, and four peaks ( 19.0
absolute peaks are sca red along alls, while the absolute peaks’ tte
ω , 10.1 ω , 19.1 ω  and 10.2 ω ) appear 
during T = 240 ~ 520.  Although the dom 1inant peak is 0.1 ω , once again, the 
resonance corresponding to 2.0ω1 might be related to the rrence of swirling 
waves.

4.4  wave pattern and resonant modes 
 
The natural modes and modal system obtained by Faltisen et al. (2000) suggested that 
two subclasses of wave patterns exist. The first one consists of two-dimensional 
Stokes wave pattern, and the corresponding waves are called as planar waves ( Miles , 
1994) 
They are ( ) ( )1 1cos

As stated in the previous sub-section, the major reson

resonant peaks occur and they are corresponding to the first natural mode of the 
system and excitation frequency. The diagonal wave is generated by a tank under 
couple surge and sway motions with excited angle = 45o, and the mode of ω0,1 and ω1,0, 
therefore, might provide equal effect on sloshing wave. Fig.4.60(a) depicts the mode 
shape of combining ω0,1 and ω1,0, and the resulting mode shape apparently likes a 
diagonal wave sloshing in the tank. The sub-plots of Fig. 4.60 show the surface 
contour of diagonal wave patterns and they demonstrate clear correlation between the 
surface elevation and the combined resonant modes of ω0,1 and ω1,0. Again under a 
diagonal forcing with the excitation frequency = 1.5 ω1, the sloshing wave pattern 
changes to square-like wave. Fig. 4.61 depicts the square like wave patterns and the 
resonant mode shape. The spectral analysis of a square like wave presents two peaks, 
and they are also corresponding to the first fundamental frequency and excitation 
frequency. The combination of mode of ω1,0 and ω0,1 with 0.5 weight is depicted in Fig. 
4.61(a) and the terraced planes at the diagonal corners are seen in the figure. As 
shown in the plots of the surface wave contour, the surface elevation also shows that 
the terrace planes at the corners A and C. The plots of Fig. 4.61 demonstrate a clear 
evidence of the solid correlation between sloshing surface patterns and resonant 
modes.

4.5 Comparison between inviscid and viscid flow in tanks 
 
In this section, we present the results of inviscid fluid compare to viscid fluid sloshing 
in tanks. Only swirling waves are chosen 
-Z directions 
for comparison as shown in Fig 4.64. For 
ulation in order to viscous fluid, we use more fine meshes in the numerical sim
. The meshes using in viscous fluid in X-Yconsider the boundary layer
are 128*64*128, respectively. As we can find in Fig 4.64 (a), the wave elevation of 
point A of viscous fluid is a little bit smaller than that of inviscid one. The damping 
influence due to viscous effect is clear but not large. The reasons are the viscosity 
coefficient of water ν =1.14 6 210 /m s−×  is small and the damping effect is not 
obvious in the first beating period. However, the damping effect will cause the result 
of steady-state situation after several beating periods. In the present study, we only 
consider the transient time of a tank undergoing various forcing. Moreover, because of 
the calculation time of viscous case is much more than inviscid one (about 5~6 times, 
when using 4 cpus to calculate.) Thus, we don’t show the steady-state result of 
viscous fluid. Fig 4.64 (b) shows the FFT analyses of both viscous and inviscid fluid 
and it presents the dominant peaks of both cases are almost the same. Fig 4.64 (c) 
shows the distribution of absolute peaks and the results of swirling waves changing its 
direction are also found in the viscous fluid.

occur near resonant frequency excitation, but also at excitation frequencies far 
away from the first natural frequency of the system.

the tank being excited at various excitation angles.
