ABSTRACT 
Among occurrence of cancer among women, 
breast cancer ranks as the top killer. Among 
various arsenals the physicians have to fight 
this disease, chemotherapy ranks as one of 
the top widely used treatment methods. 
However, cancer treatment is often 
patent-specific; chemotherapeutic drug for 
one patient might not be effective for 
another. This research aims to design a 
microfluific, dielectrophoresis (DEP)-based 
cellular microarray chip, with a PDMS 
concentration gradient generator, to provide 
uniform dielectrophoretic cell patterning 
(DCP). Then, patterned cells were allowed 
to interact with a drug in concentrations. 
Results showed that the cellular microarray 
chip provided uniform cell patterning which 
would ensure a reliable cellular microarray 
study, since different amounts of cells in a 
cell pattern may affect cellular biosynthesis 
to influence an outcome. Furthermore, the 
biocompatibility of the chip was verified. 
The aforementioned results suggest the 
DEP-based cellular microarray chip would 
be feasible for finding optimal chemo drug 
combinations to improving the efficacy of 
chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION 
Breast cancer is a top killer for women. 
Among various arsenals the physicians have 
to fight this disease, chemotherapy ranks as 
one of the top widely used treatment 
methods. However, cancer treatment is 
somewhat patent-specific; chemotherapeutic 
drug for one patient might not be effective 
for another. 
Table 1 provides a chemotherapeutic 
drug guideline for invasive breast cancer 
used in National Taiwan University Hospital. 
The table suggests that although a wide 
variety of drugs are available to oncologists, 
discuss with doctors revealed that the 
challenges often lie in not knowing which 
regiment is best for a particular patient prior 
to treatment. A single treatment takes 
approximately six weeks. If a particular drug 
is not effective, the doctor might prescribe 
another attempt with a slightly modified 
regiment. By then, 1.5 months of precious 
time would have elapsed. 
A microfluidics device might help to 
along the edges of an electrode is adopted, 
as shown in Figure 1, since cells are usually 
patterned along electrode edges where 
localized maximum in electric field exists, 
Second, the gap region of the interdigitated 
design is crucial to ensure quality cellular 
pattern. To wit, the inner gap of a PIRE is 
smaller than the outer gap (see lower right 
portion of Fig. 1), causing cells to be 
patterned near the PIRE center first, then 
proceed towards the circumference. Finally, 
the PIRE design allows much less 
inter-connecting wiring among electrodes. 
Another consideration for the design is 
rapid patterning of cells. This would (a) 
minimize the effect of electric field on 
cells,11 (b) limit the exposure of cells to DEP 
buffers that often lack components for 
normal cellular functions,8 and (c) reduce 
the influence of additional forces (e.g. bulk 
convection and Brownian motion) that may 
compromise quality of cell patterns.8 
Towards rapid patterning, electrodes with 
sufficient width – that would accelerate cells 
to be patterned18 – were used.  
Moreover, leverage of several features 
of conventional cellular microarray might 
prove helpful for the present microfluidic 
chip. Thus, the design of the PIRE array 
features – e.g. an overall circular shape, 
diameter of PIRE, and spacing between two 
neighboring PIREs – are chosen to be 
compatible with widely available 
non-microfluidic microarray analysis 
platforms. With all considerations made, the 
dimensions of the PIRE array were 
15-μm-wide fixed electrode width, 
10-μm-wide inner gap, 15-μm-wide outer 
gap, 125 μm diameter of a single PIRE, and 
200 μm center-to-center spacing between 
two neighboring PIREs. 
A commercial finite element software 
(Comsol Multiphysics) was used to optimize 
the design of PIRE. 3D modeling was 
adopted to calculate non-uniform electric 
field in steady-state. The geometry used is 
representative of true experimental 
conditions, with a 50-μm-high chamber and 
200-nm-thick ITO PIREs. The boundary 
conditions imposed are: field continuity 
between different materials, electric 
insulation on the top and side walls, and 
applied AC signal of 5 Vpp at 5 MHz on all 
PIREs. Further, we set the glass substrate’s 
conductivity to 1 × 10-18 S m-1 and its 
relative permittivity to 4.2. The settings of 
the DEP buffer are conductivity of 2.31 × 
10-2 S m-1, relative permittivity of 80, and 
density of 1000 kg m-3. 
 
 
Figure 1  The integrated microfluidic chip. 
The chip mainly constitutes two parts: an ITO 
glass with planner interdigitating ring 
electrode (PIRE) arrays, and a concentration 
gradient generator. 
 
Experimental 
Chip fabrication and collagen coating 
The chip microfabrication consists of the 
PIRE array and the concentration gradient 
generator. First, photoresist (S1813, Shipley) 
was micropatterned on an 210-nm-thick ITO 
film (416-744-X0, Merck) (Fig.2a). Then, an 
RIE system (Plasmalab 80 plus, OXFORD) 
was used to generate argon plasma (chamber 
pressure 10 mTorr, flow rate 40 sccm, 
forward power 200 W, treating time 25 min.) 
to micromachine the ITO as PIRE arrays 
(Fig.2b). Photoresist was then be stripped 
off using acetone (Fig.2c). Photoresist was 
also used in order to micropattern collagen 
(Fig.2d). 
The concentration gradient generator 
features channels of 50 μm height and 100 
μm width, meandering throughout its length 
to allow time for mixing. It was fabricated 
via soft lithography in PDMS (Sylgard 184, 
Dow Corning). Then, the molded PDMS 
with interface ports was bonded to the 
micromachined ITO glass after both are 
treated with oxygen plasma (Fig.2e). 
 4
chip was incubated at 37oC for 24 hours for 
cell viability test. 
 
Cell viability test 
Cell viability of the patterned cells is 
examined after incubation for 24 hours. First, 
calcein AM (C3100MP, Invitrogen), the 
fluorescent stain for living cells, is prepared 
as a stock solution (50 μL calcein AM in 9.6 
μL DMSO). Then, the calcein AM stock 
solution is diluted with PBS (calcein AM 
stock solution : PBS = 1 : 250). Next, the 
calcein AM dilution is injected into the 
assay chambers through top two inlets at the 
flow rate of 5μL min-1 to replace the cell 
culture medium. When calcein AM is 
permeated a living cell’s plasma membrane, 
calcein AM is then hydrolyzed by the 
esterase present in the cytoplasm of a living 
cell to form calcein which emitted bright 
green fluorescence. Then, green fluorescent 
and DIC images of cells are taken via a 
CCD camera (DP-70, Olympus) on a 
microscope (IX-71, Olympus). 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The concentration gradient generator 
Figure 3a displays the PDMS concentration 
gradient generator which can be used to 
provide a concentration gradient of a 
stimulus. A designed concentration gradient 
with high uniformity was obtained by 
injecting two streams from top two inlets 
(Fig. 3b). The stable concentration gradient 
may ensure reliable concentrations of a 
stimulus for cellular microarray studies.

Localized electric fields on cell patterning 
Results of simulation of localized electric 
fields (5 Vpp at 5MHz) (Fig. 4) represented 
a stronger non-uniform electric field by 
yellow (or white in black-and-white printing) 
and a weaker field by black. The 
non-uniform electric fields of the PIREs 
were spatially localized, and the electric 
field strength near the center of a PIRE was 
generally stronger than that near the outer 
edge of the same PIRE, due to the smaller 
gap near the center. When cells flowed 
through PIREs, they simultaneously 
experienced a hydrodynamic force (FHD) 
from a background flow and positive DEP 
forces (FDEP) from the non-uniform electric 
fields. Prior to cells arriving at PIREs, forces 
acting on the cells contribute to the 
directions of resultant forces, pushing them 
toward PIREs. If a cell is not patterned by a 
given PIRE, the cell shall be patterned by a 
downstream PIRE

region of 2×2 PIREs (5 Vpp at 5MHz). 
 
The performance of DCP 
By using DCP, cells were patterned within 
minutes, while hours would be required for 
microarrayer approaches. Figure 5a reveals 
cells were patterned onto a 6×6 PIRE array. 
The patterned cells covered on entire surface 
of each PIRE, not only along the edges, 
which were in accord with the simulation

二、 與會心得 
很高興能夠有這次的機會出國參加國際性的研討會。在碩士班一年級的時
候，在指導老師的帶領下參加過一次在國內舉辦的研討會，也大致上瞭解研討會
的進行方式，也因為上次的經驗這次出國參加研討會前也比較踏實了一些。上一
次出國也是好久好久以前的事了，這次出國參加研討會真的是很期待。 
在提早兩天到丹佛並熟悉環境後，終於到了研討會第一天(6/21)的歡迎會
（reception），不過第一天就發生一件比較不好的事情。一開始在歡迎會中我和
林建明學長一起吃著主辦單位所準備食物與飲料，當中也遇到一些台灣來的老師
與學生，我們也試著與各國的學者聊天，後來有一位在美國工作的大陸學者主動
用中文來與我們聊，也聊我們的身份也聊台灣現在的狀況，聊得也蠻愉快的。但
是聊到一半的時候他就說希望用我們學生的身份幫他老婆代買主辦單位所舉辦的
CHUCKWAGON BBQ AND RODEO BANGQUET(需付費，用學生身份買較便宜)，一開始我
們也向他說到時候主辦單位應該會檢查身份吧！但是他還是說希望我們去買買
看，我實在說不過他就用我的身份去買了。在後來自己在想越想越不對，當時不
應該幫那位大陸學者買票，這樣就變成用我的身份來幫別人作壞事。那位大陸學
者也可能是因為在美國久了，也很清楚在美國人的文化，也猜想主辦單位也不會
檢查證件，就像我這幾天觀察的美國的文化許多都是自由心證。不過這也是個經
驗，如果下次還有類似的狀況應該要勇敢地說不，避免這種事情的再次發生。 
在研討會的第二天(6/22)也是研討會正式會議開始的第一天。早上也聽了三
位被邀請在全部與會者前報告大師級演講者的演講，聽了三位大師級學者的報
告，才真的瞭解到在這個領域的發展已經在許多地方都有所發揮，值得我們的借
鏡與學習。而下午主要的就是林建明學長的口頭報告了，而前一晚我們也在飯店
也至少練習了快十次，我也盡量幫助建明學長注意一些報告時要注意的事項。下
午在看完了與自己比較有相關的海報後，也提早了半個小時到口頭報告的會場準
與建明學長在博物館內 
在研討會的時候也看了許多海報，有的也向海報作者提問。但是自己的英文
程度還不夠好，與他人交談還是有些困難，有時也是因為作者的母語也不是英文
所以其實溝通起來還是有些問題，但是還好在共同的技術上能夠互相的瞭解，除
此之外也與他們交換了名片，並告訴他們我們目前的研究主題，以及我們會在今
年十一月份在韓國濟州島參加另一個研討會MicroTAS。 
在研討會的最後一天，我與建明學長在同一個口頭報告會場聽講者報告，聽
到其中一位報告者的報告，當下我就對他的內容有一些問題，也小聲的問建明學
長他報告的內容，建明學長就也鼓勵我在講者報告完，回答問題時間時去問問題，
我在準備衝出去問問題的時候，也免不了很緊張，但是還好在報完自己的身份與
姓名，問題也很順利的提出來，問講者為何他的結果圖中誤差會這麼大？作者也
告訴我們是因為生物實驗的關係所以誤差很大。雖然我們對這個答案不大滿意，
但是後來再跟建明學長討論後也能夠知道我們以後在做實驗該如何避免這些問題
的發生，如何在實驗變因與實驗設計上能夠注意。研討會的最後一天也發現與會
的人似乎也變少了一些，與會議正式開始的第一天相比大概少了三成的人，不過
主辦單位也是很有心的在最後一天推出了知名的冰淇淋讓大家吃，也算是給大家
一個美好的結束。 
研討會中看到了其實很多很有特色的研究，不過大體來說，不同國家所專長
的研究項目真的也不同，像是日本人所做精密元件就真的讓人驚嘆，他們到底怎
