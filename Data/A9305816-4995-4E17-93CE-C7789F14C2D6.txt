correlation-based watermarking system, 
which consists of three basic procedures: 
watermark construction, embedding, and 
correlation detection. To construct the 
watermark, a holographic technique is 
employed to encode the mark pattern into an 
interference noise pattern, which is then used 
as a random watermark. The embedding 
process simply adds the weighted watermark 
to the host image in an imperceptible way. 
The correlation-based detection is a robust 
and reliable way to determine the presence of 
the watermark in a given image, and it is 
suitable to implement the correlation in an 
optical information process. Thus, our 
previous research [1] proposed an optical 
correlator to detect the watermark.

In our system, we treat the nonzero-order

where ),( ηξH  denotes the host image and is 
considered as a deterministic field. By 
assuming that the amplitude of the reference

output of the nonlinear device, the nonlinear 
function should have an inverse Laplace 
transform, and (3) it adequately models a 
wide variety of nonlinearity, for example the 
nonlinear relationship in Fig. 2 can be 
approximately modeled by the power law 
function with nonlinearity 3.2=υ  
(dashed-line in this figure). When the 
watermarked image in Eq. (5) is 
superimposed, a small portion of the 
watermark in the cover image is distributed 
over the interval [ ]0,1 . Thus, it is reasonable 
to assume that the dynamic range of the 
watermarked image is in [ ]0,1 . Therefore, we 
utilize the half-wave power law transfer

where υ  is a positive value that represents 
the severity of the nonlinearity and x  is the 
input of the nonlinear device as shown in Fig. 
2. When 1=υ , we have a linear device, 
while 1>>υ  or 1<<υ  indicates severe 
nonlinearity. The nonlinear characteristic 
induces the high-order harmonic terms in 
which the m th harmonic term is modulated 
by the phase )),(2(),( ηξφξπηξθ Famm −= . Thus,

Importantly, only the first-order term (i.e., 
corresponding to 1=m ) of the output 
preserves the phase function of the 
transformed mark ),( ηξF . Also notice from 
Eq. (5) that one requires that the phase of 
this output exactly matches the phase 
function of ),( ηξF  for a sharp correlation. 
Since the phase field ),( βαφF  is independent 
random noise, the high-order phase terms 
),( βαφFm  are completely uncorrelated with 
the original phase. Thus, the high-order 
terms exhibit no correlation peak in the 
output plane. Based on the mathematical 
analysis of the nonlinear watermarking 
system [2], the first-order harmonic of the 
nonlinear output for the nonlinear result can 
be obtained by:

To observe the effect of the nonlinearity 
on the correlation output, one can clearly see 
from Eq. (9) that the intensity of first 
correlation term is positively related to the 
term 1),( −υηξαυ H , where 1),( −υηξυ H  
corresponds to the first-order derivative of 
the power law function when the input is 
),( ηξH . Consequently, if the cover image 
operates on the high ascent region of the 
power law function, the nonlinear function 
will enhance the watermark information and 
lead to a high correlation peak. Therefore, if 
one can carefully control the average value 
of the cover image around the high ascent 
region of the nonlinear function, it is 
possible to enhance the sharpness of the 
correlation peak by increasing the severity of 
the nonlinearity. 
 
3. Optimal correlation detection 
During the detection process, it is 
common practice to set a threshold value for 
the output correlation signal to determine 
whether or not the watermark is detected. 
For this reason, appropriate selection of the 
correlation threshold is essential for a 
reliable watermark detector. Due to the 
absence of a mathematical model to analyze 
the watermarking system, we simulated 500 
experimental trials to find a suitable 
threshold for watermark detection in a 
previous paper [1], which led to an 
impractical watermarking system. This 
6 
 
present two types of errors: false positives 
and false negatives. A false positive occurs 
when the detector incorrectly indicates that a 
watermark is present; a false negative occurs 
when the detector incorrectly indicates that a 
watermark is absent. The error probabilities 
of false positives (
fpP ) and false negatives 
(
fnP ) are functions of the threshold and can 
be evaluated approximately by [5]:

1)( .  For positive 
values of x , the error function )(xerfc  is 
monotonically decreasing. Obviously, false 
positives decrease with an increasing 
threshold, while false negatives increase. In 
this work, an optimal threshold can be 
derived by minimizing the sum of the error 
functions as follows: { }min ( ) ( )fp fnTT P T P T= +% (18)                                         
Since both false positives and false negatives 
are monotonic functions of the threshold, this 
summation is a convex function of the 
threshold. Therefore, setting the first partial 
derivative of the error to zero, that is 
{ }( ) ( ) 0fp fnP T P TT∂ + =∂ , and by simple 
mathematical derivations, the optimal 
threshold can be acquired from the roots of 
the following second-order equation:

With this result, the optimal threshold 
can be used to determine whether or not the 
mark is present with minimal detection error. 
The digital signal processing scheme in 
Fig. 3 is used to find an optimal threshold for 
the correlation signal to determine whether 
or not the authorized mark is present. As 
indicated, we first use Eqs. (12), (13), and 
(15) to estimate the statistical parameters of 
the correlation signal. Then, an optimal 
threshold is determined by minimizing the 
detection error, which is obtained from the 
roots of Eq. (19). Finally, the reliability of 
the detector is evaluated by the error 
probability using Eq. (17).

4. Experimental results 
In this section, we assess reliability of the 
theoretical model using computer simulation 
results. Figure 4 illustrates an example of the 
experimental setup. A holographic 
watermark is constructed and embedded 
using a constant-level algorithm into a 
64×64 ×8-bit host image. By applying an 
optical holographic process to the mark 
image, one obtains a watermark with a 
pseudorandom pattern as shown in Fig. 4(c). 
The watermark is superimposed into the host 
image with a constant weighting factor 
( 0.05α= ), where the peak signal-to-noise ratio 
between the watermarked and original 
images are used to evaluate image distortion. 
The resulting watermarked image is 
illustrated in Fig. 4(d).
