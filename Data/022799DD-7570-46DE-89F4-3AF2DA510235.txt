working tree. In the fault recovery phase, the 
disrupted working paths would be dynamically 
rerouted to pre-calculated backup paths when 
failures occur. In this research, all paths are 
supposed to transmit in bi-direction. The local 
rings and sustaining ring are set up and used for 
creating fault protection paths in a mesh network 
when the multicast tree based on the minimum 
spanning tree is established. Information about the 
local rings and sustaining ring will be periodically 
renewed.  
 
2.1 Protection setup phase 
After receiving the multicast member 
message, the multicast tree session T  will be 
divided into several disjoint segment-blocks 
, where  is the source 
node,  is the i
},,,,{ 1 mi SSSsT KK= s
iS
th segment-block and  is the 
number of main branches. The member nodes in 
each segment-block may have intermediate 
member nodes and leaf nodes.  
m
After partitioning the multicast tree into 
several segment-blocks, the leaf nodes order 
 in  is obtained by 
in-order tree traversal, where 
),...,,( 21 ri dddD = iS
r  is the number of 
leaf nodes in . Two types of protection rings 
will be set up and reserved for restoration in each 
segment-block, which are the local rings and one 
sustaining ring. The local ring covering the leaf 
node  and leaf node , where 
, is set up with the minimum cost 
and the number of local rings in  is 
iS
kd 1+kd

iS 1−r . 
When some failures occur in the working tree, the 
disrupted leaf nodes can be re-connected to other 
unaffected leaf nodes through those local rings 
between them. One sustaining ring covering source 
node and one leaf node is to enhance survivability 
of the segment-block when the failures occur at 
main branch. The chosen leaf node  
, called sub-tree head node, is 
obtained in the sustaining ring with the minimum 
cost ring to cover the leaf node and the source 
node. Flowchart of this phase is shown in Fig. 2.

2.2 Fault recovery phase 
When failure occurs in the working tree of 
multicast session, the failure can be detected and 
located by the adjacent nodes. If one node in the 
multicast tree detects that its parent node or the 
link connecting to its parent fails, it broadcasts the 
information to all nodes of this multicast tree via 
protection rings (including local rings or the 
sustaining ring) or unaffected working links. After 
this procedure, all member nodes of each 
segment-block can be partitioned into the affected 
member nodes and the unaffected member nodes. 
There are two types of affected member nodes 
need to be considered, which are the leaf nodes 
and the intermediate member nodes. Hence, the 
recovery procedure of this proposed algorithm in 
each member node will be initiated to deal with the 
leaf node disruption and/or the intermediate 
member node disruption.  
 Fault recovery of leaf nodes  
When the main branch is uninjured or at least 
one leaf node is healthy, the affected leaf nodes 
will notify the adjacent healthy leaf nodes. Then, 
the fault restoration mechanism will start from the

Our method is simply to reverse the transmission 
direction of outgoing links from this disrupted 
intermediate member node to a nearby and healthy 
leaf node with minimum cost as the restoration 
path. 
 
3. Simulation Evaluation 
The performance of the proposed algorithm 
is analyzed by simulating the mesh-based NSFNet 
(14 nodes and 21 links) and USANet (24 nodes 
and 43 links) networks, as shown in Fig. 9. In the 
experiments, each link includes only one fiber on 
which 32 and 64 wavelengths data can be 
transmitted, including two wavelengths used as 
bidirectional control channels and the conversion 
time of each converter is 0.001ms [18]. Source 
node and destination nodes of multicast session are 
randomly selected, and the multicast group size 
(session size) is also randomly assigned from the 
interval . Then, the minimum spanning 
tree (MST) approach is applied to construct the 
multicast tree for each multicast session. Multicast 
connection requests arrive with Poisson 
distribution 
}8,7,6{
=λ {1, 2, …, 10} per minute, and 
their holding time is exponentially distributed 
(approximately a few minutes to hours). After the 
working tree is constructed for the multicast 
session, single failure point is randomly set in the 
multicast tree. Each experiment is run for 1000 
multicast connections, and all results are calculated 
and averaged. The performance of the MRLR 
proposed herein is compared with that of other 
methodologies, such as Path-based protection, 
Dual tree protection and OFO (one ring for one 
session) protection, in terms of the blocking 
probability, recovery time and average hop count 
of protection path. The results are shown in Fig. 5.

4. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have proposed a novel 
ring-based local recovery mechanism, Multiple 
Rings-based Local Restoration (MRLR), for 
one-point to multi-point multicast traffic with 
minimum spanning tree in WDM mesh networks. 
The MRLR scheme can recover multiple faults 
using local rings and avoid the lethal faults occur 
at the main branch. The simulation results show 
that the MRLR scheme outperforms the path 
protection, dual tree protection and OFO 
protection in terms of the blocking probability, 
recovery time and average hop count of protection 
path, especially in complicated network topology. 
The MRLR scheme is scalable to large size mesh 
networks and can achieve high network 
survivability, fast and reliable.
