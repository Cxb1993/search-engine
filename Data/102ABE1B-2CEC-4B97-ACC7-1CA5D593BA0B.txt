plates. A system combined with an HP8757D network analyzer and an HP8350B sweep oscillator 
was employed in the measurement. The same technique was applied in measuring the temperature 
coefficient of resonant frequency (τf).  
3. Results and discussion 
XRD patterns of 0.9(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-0.1(Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramic sintered at various 
temperatures for 4 h. The crystal structures of (Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3 and (Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 are 
trigonal (ICDD-PDF #00-006-0494) and cubic, respectively. The formation of mixed phases in the 
0.9(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-0.1(Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramic system was due to structured differences. 
Therefore, a solid solution system could not be obtained. The XRD patterns of the 
0.9(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-0.1(Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramic system did not significantly change with 
sintering temperature in the range of 1100-1225oC. 
The grain increase with increasing sintering temperatures obvious and the 
0.9(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-0.1(Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramic system was not dense and the grain did 
not grow at 1100oC. However, rapid grain growth was observed at 1200oC and the pores were 
almost eliminated for the specimen sintered at 1150oC. In the past report, Huang et al., [9], the EDX 
analysis exhibited several types of grains: large grains were identified as (Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3 
and small cubic-shape grains were identified as (Nd 0.5Na0.5)TiO3.  
Bulk densities of x(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-(1-x)(Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramic at different sintering 
temperatures for 4 h. The densities increased with increasing sintering temperature due to the 
enlarged grain size. The increase in bulk density with increasing sintering temperature might be due 
to the decrease in the number of pores , while the decrease in bulk density might be due to abnormal 
grain growth. The bulk density seemed to saturate at 1150oC. A maximum density of 3.85 g/cm3 
was obtained for 0.85(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-0.15(Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramic sintered at 1150oC for 
4 h.  
x(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-(1-x)( Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramic system at various sintering 
temperatures for 4 h. The relationship between εr values and sintering temperature shows the same 
trend as that between density and sintering temperature since higher density means lower porosity. 
The dielectric constant slightly increased with increasing sintering temperature. The εr values of 
0.9(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-0.1(Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramics increased from 21.9 to 23.33 when the 
sintering temperature was increased from 1100 to 1225oC. 
Microwave dielectric loss can be divided into intrinsic loss and extrinsic loss. Intrinsic losses 
are mainly caused by lattice vibration modes while extrinsic losses are dominated by second phases, 
oxygen vacancies, grain sizes and densification or porosity. Interfacial polarization is thought to 
play an important role in porous materials. With increasing sintering temperature, the Q×f value 
increased to a maximum value and then decreased. A maximum Q×f value of 77000 GHz was 
obtained for 0.95(Mg0.7Zn0.3)0.95Co0.05TiO3-0.05(Nd0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramic at 1150oC. The microwave 
dielectric loss is mainly caused by the lattice vibrational modes, pores, second phases, impurities, 
and lattice defects. Relative density also plays an important role in controlling dielectric loss, as has 
been shown for other microwave dielectric materials.
