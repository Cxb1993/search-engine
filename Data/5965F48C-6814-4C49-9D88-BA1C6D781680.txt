三、 國內外相關研究
長時間駕駛會造成駕駛疲勞，與長途空中旅行
的活動類似，必須保持靜態坐姿，長時間下易造成
下半身靜脈血液迴流不良，會造成腦部缺氧、暈
眩，甚至造成大腿浮腫及深度靜脈血栓(Deep Vein
Thrombosis)現象，這些症狀發生的主因是身體失去
恆定狀態。過去很多相關案例與研究顯示，由於長
時間的空中旅行，造成 DVT 之原因很多，其中一
項重要因子為靜止不動，Markus Mittermayer 等
(2003)研究證實，由於長時間空中旅行，靜止不動
狀況下，人體的末端會造成血液顯著的累積，包括
較低的腿部及脛節，並且造成組織厚度增加，甚至
飛行落地後仍維持數天；Fabrice Paganin (2003)研
究提到，在飛行期間適當的活動可顯著的降低靜脈
血栓之問題；Bo Eklof 等(1996)研究顯示，造成靜
脈血栓的風險因子很多，其中一項因子為靜止不
動；上述相關研究證實，長時間久座，無論長時間
駕駛或者長途空中旅行，皆會造成末端血液累積及
靜脈血液迴流不良情形，亦即身體會失去恆定狀
態，本研究將從這個角度來探討駕駛疲勞問題。
本研究將以血壓及體溫作為恆定程度的指
標，輔已 HRV、HF、LF 及 LF/HF 等生理參數來
作解釋，有關心率變異(Heart Rate Variability)生理
指標之量測，過去有學者將心率變異(HRV)用於衡
量心智負荷的程度，例如：Nis Hjortskov 等(2004)
在電腦作業期間當給予一心智應力時利用心率變
異(HRV)及血壓來衡量對受測者的影響程度，Anne
Helene Garde 等(2002)利用心率變異(HRV)所推衍
的自律神經活動的指標：LF(AU)、LF(NU)、
HF(AU)、HF(NU)、LF/HF、TP(AU)來衡量當給予
一心智應力及身體需求時對受測者的影響程度，另
外 J. Wahlstrom 等(2002)利用滑鼠來執行電腦作業
期間調查時間壓力及言語的激怒對於心理及生理
參數(血壓、心搏率、LF/HF 等)是否有影響？以上
研究都是透過客觀的生理指標來衡量受測者所承
受的心智負荷大小。
三 結果與討論
Multiple vital physiological parameters, in
addition to a written questionnaire, were monitored in
the study to evaluate driving-induced fatigue.
Furthermore, an attempt to reduce driving fatigue
symptoms was made by the introduction of a 15-min
exercise break in group B. Physiological parameter
changes and their implications and interactions are
discussed below.
Systolic pressure (SYS) was lowered from 116.7
mmHg before driving to 110.2 mmHg after driving
for group A (without exercise). In contrast, SYS was
almost unchanged (116.7 mmHg before driving and
116.4 mmHg after driving) for group B with the
15-min exercise break. Independent t-test confirmed
that SYS was significantly different between the two
driving groups after driving. Diastolic pressure was
little changed in either driving group. Overall,
homeostasis of blood pressure was better maintained
in group B with the assistance of the 15-min exercise
which was specifically designed to boost lower body
and systemic circulation. The results are in agreement
with written questionnaire where group A volunteers
felt more exhausted than group B. From these results,
deviation of systolic pressure from homeostasis could
be a candidate for quantitative index of driver fatigue.
On the other hand, diastolic pressure change is not a
sensitive parameter for monitoring fatigue. Our
results differ from those reported by Fumio et al.
(2002) where SYS was found to increase in taxi
drivers measured during city road traffic. SYS
increase was reported by other authors in various
studies where subjects were asked to perform a
stress-laden task. The authors of this study believe
that several experimental settings are different
between this and those cited studies. Our in-door
driving is based upon highway scenery with the
objective to simulate long-hour driving. The traffic
conditions are neither complex nor action-demanding.
It normally would not produce high degree of
nervousness or anxiety in drivers. On the other hand,
poor circulation caused by long-hour lower body
immobilization is a characteristic of the experimental
setting. In contrast, city road driving tends to be short
in duration but requires frequent and spontaneous
actions by drivers. Immobilization is not a major
concern as drivers often get off the seat to assist
passengers. Computer tasks and in-door flight
simulations both influence more in mental stress and
less in systemic circulation. Consequently, SYS was
seen increased in those studies due to increased
mental load. One would argue that if those studies
were to extend the time of study (into several hours),
mental stress would lead to fatigue eventually. One
would further expect that SYS would be lowered
under these circumstances.
Heart rate (HR) was reduced significantly after
driving in both group A (from 70.4 before driving to
65.6 after driving) and group B (from 71.3 before
driving to 64.2 after driving). The finding is in
agreement with other in-door driving studies where
HR was seen decreased as well. In-door simulated
driving tends to be less stressful compared to actual
road driving, due in part to the volunteer’s
recognition that the simulation is non-real. A stressful
condition might have cause an increase in HR. In
4exercise break. Our findings here explain well in
physiological terms why driving while being tired is
highly risky.
The interpretation of our overall findings in this
study can be summarized here. As driving fatigue
develops, cardio-vascular system is unable to fulfill
the basic physiological needs. Hands and feet become
cold (TLP and TRP lowered as observed), heart rate
slows, and eventually blood pressures go down. Poor
circulation causes muscle pain and numbness.
Hypoxia in brain induces drowsiness and loss of
concentration. Under these circumstances, our body
re-assesses the new physiological needs and activates
ANS instantly (seen with changes in HRV parameters
in the study). If re-assessment finds the body under
exhaustion which requires an immediate rest, the
parasympathetic nerve branch in ANS is called upon.
On the other hand, if re-assessment determines that a
boost to cardiovascular system can meet the new
physiological needs, the sympathetic nerve branch is
activated. The success of ANS action depends on
several factors, including mental alertness, heart
strength, and peripheral circulation resistance.
Immobilization of the lower body, which increases
blood flow resistance significantly, could
compromise the sympathetic nerve’s function in
boosting systemic circulation. Since the monitoring
of physiological parameters was done at the
beginning and the ending of driving in the study, it is
unclear whether or not the sympathetic nerve branch
was activated first in the early face of driving for
group A. Noted that at the end of driving for this
group, the parasympathetic activity was enhanced.
Under these conditions, if the driver continues to
drive, the risk of traffic accidents would be extremely
high. For group B, the sympathetic nerve was
enhanced at the end of driving, which helped to
maintain systolic pressure and other vital parameters.
But even the ANS action in this group is regarded as
a partial success since palm temperatures and heart
rate were still below baseline.
The results of this study indicate that driving
fatigue can be tracked by vital physiological
parameters, including extremity temperatures, heart
rate, and blood pressures. Significant deviation of any
vital parameter from baseline during or after driving
should be viewed as a symptom of fatigue. We
further propose that among the HRV parameters
recorded, the normalized parasympathetic index
HF(NU) (in a positive correlation to fatigue), the
normalized sympathetic index LF(NU) (in a negative
correlation to fatigue), and the sympatho-vagal
balance index LF/HF (in a negative correlation to
fatigue) are three most promising parameters that
could be further developed to quantify driver fatigue.
