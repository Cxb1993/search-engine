current with a sinusoidal wave resulting from application of 
resonant technology increases voltage/current stress on the 
component. Significant conduction loss is simultaneously 
generated as circuit components have parasitic resistance. 
Therefore, a ZVT/ZCT soft-switching power converter is 
created to further improve resonant converter performance. 
Using available devices and circuit technologies, PWM 
converters have generally been designed to operate with 
high switching frequency. However, high switching 
frequency increases switching loss. Switching loss when 
the power switch is turned off is primarily caused by 
converter leakage inductance. As the power switch is 
turned on, switching losses are generally the result of an 
abrupt discharge of energy stored in the parasitic capacitor 
of active power switches. Several resonant converters have 
been developed that decrease switching losses for active 
power switches in switch-mode converters. However, due 
to the resonant character of current and voltage waveforms, 
operating resonant converters typically requires high 
circulating energy, which significantly increases 
conduction losses.  
The ZVT PWM technique, which decreases switching 
losses, can be considered an extension of the 
zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) scheme. The ZVT PWM 
approach uses a shunt resonant branch to generate soft 
switching. During switching transition, the shunt resonant 
tank creates a partial resonance that obtains the ZVS. When 
switching transition is completed, the shunt resonant tank is 
disabled, such that ZVT PWM converter operation 
resembles that of a conventional PWM converter. Thus, the 
ZVT PWM converter can attain soft switching without 
increasing voltage stress on active power switches. 
Soft-switching power converters can be classified as 
ZVS/ZCS PWM power converters or ZVT/ZCT 
soft-switching power converters. The most important 
design feature of ZVS/ZCS PWM power converters is the 
addition of an auxiliary switch in the quasi-resonant circuit. 
Resonance is dominated by this auxiliary switch, which 
generates resonance and temporarily stops during a period 
that can be regulated, thereby solving the problems of fixed 
conduction and cut-off time in quasi-resonant power 
converters. The main design feature of ZVT/ZCT 
soft-switching power converters is that they have resonant 
components that decrease conduction losses. The auxiliary 
switch forms a resonant loop, decreasing voltage or current 
on the power switch to zero, which switches before the 
main power switch is switched to the conducting state. The 
ZVT/ZCT soft-switching power converter also decreases 
component stress, conduction losses by reducing 
voltage/current and minimizes switching loss. This work 
combines the advantages of PWM schemes and ZVT 
topology to build a highly efficient and low-stress ZVT 
PWM battery charger. 
In this work, the ZVT soft-switching boost converter is 
utilized as a basic device for charging a lead-acid battery. 
The most significant benefit of the proposed charger are the 
extension of resonant time using two clamped diodes, 
reduced voltage and current stress over those that use 
traditional resonant components, elimination of the 
parasitic effect, and reduction of switching loss. Both 
voltage and current are sinusoidal resonant waveforms as 
the main switch switches, considerably reducing the area of 
overlap between voltage and current, thereby decreasing 
switching loss associated with the auxiliary switch and 
resonant circuit in a soft-switching power converter. 
Resonance only occurs before the power switch is turned 
on. Therefore, the high voltage/large current stress caused 
by resonance can be prevented, markedly reducing 
conduction loss in a converter. 
Batteries cannot work without an energy source for 
recharging. The charging technique is key to replenishing 
energy and ensuring that the battery works continuously, 
allowing it to provide a normal power supply to a load. 
This study presents a novel boost ZVT PWM converter for 
battery chargers. Figure 1 presents the basic configuration 
of the proposed charger circuit, which includes the 
following components: (1) a dc source, (2) PWM control 
circuit, for controlling switching; and, (3) boost ZVT PWM 
resonant converter for stepping up from a low voltage to a 
high voltage to charge the battery [1]. 
 
Fig.1. System block diagram of the proposed battery charger 
 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II describes the boost converter. Section III then 
describes the battery charger with the ZVT PWM boost 
converter. Section IV elucidates the design of the proposed 
charger. Section V gives experimental results. Conclusions 
are given in Section VI. 
 
II. BOOST CONVERTER 
A boost converter is a switching converter that boosts 
output voltage to a level greater than input voltage by 
periodically turning a switch on and off. Figure 2 shows a 
boost converter topology [2]. 
Fig. 2. A boost converter 
 
As its name implies, a boost converter converts low 
input voltage into high output voltage. The most common 
applications of boost converters are as dc source suppliers 
and for dc motor speed control. The benefits of boost 
converters [2] include: (a) simple circuit structure, (b) easy 
control of the controller, (c) mature products and (d) input 
current by a large inductor in the input terminal. However, 
the shortcomings of boost converters include (a) 
hard-switching and increased losses, (b) large diode, D, and 
main switch, S, due to large losses and (c) EMI and severe 
harmonic distortion. The input current, iS, is a 
discontinuous pulsating current, which is the main cause of 
high voltage ripples leading to severe electromagnetic 
compatibility (EMC) and EMI. The power transistor in

Fig. 5. Working waveforms of the proposed battery charger 
 
(a)Mode I: inductor Lr in charging stage (t0≦t＜t1) 
Before t0, the power switch, S, and auxiliary switch, S1, 
are both off, and the freewheeling diode, Dm, is forward 
conducted by output current, Io. At t0, the main switch, S, is 
turned on. The resonant inductance current, iLr, linearly 
increases until it reaches Io at t1. Figure 5(a) displays the 
equivalent circuit. In this mode, resonant voltage vCr across 
the capacitor is zero, and resonant voltage vLr across the 
inductor equals input voltage VS. 
Prior to each period, the initial voltage on the filtering 
capacitor, Cf, is Vo, and the initial voltage on the resonance 
capacitor, Cr, is Vo. Main switch, S, and auxiliary switch, 
S1, are in off states, diode D is conducted and diode D1 is 
off. The auxiliary switch, S1, is switched to the on state 
from the off state at t0, and main switch, S, maintains the 
off state. Voltage Vo exists across the resonant inductor, Lr, 
as diode D is conducted at that time. The resonant 
inductance current, iLr, linearly increases until iLr equals 
input current, ii. Figure 6 shows the equivalent circuit of 
Mode I. 
The state equations of Mode I are obtained according to 
the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.6. ( )

The resonant inductance current, iLr, increases until iLr 
equals ii, diode D enters the cut-off state from the 
conduction state, and then enters Mode II. The working 
time during Mode I is derived from the boundary condition: 
iLr(t)=ii. The working time, T1, of Mode I can be derived 
using Eq. (3).

2.Mode II(t1≦t＜t2)，Lr and Cr resonance stage 
The initial voltage across resonant capacitor Cr is Vo, and 
the initial current in resonant inductor Lr is ii when Mode II 
starts. Because the resonant inductor current, iLr, increases 
to ii, the current, iD, flowing through diode D is zero; thus 
diode D enters the cut-off state from the conduction state. 
The main switch, S, is off, auxiliary switch, S1, 
continuously maintains an on state and diode D1 is cut off. 
Resonant inductor Lr and resonant capacitor Cr resonate 
when diode D is in a cut-off state. A voltage Vcr across the 
resonant inductor, Lr, until resonant capacitor voltage, Vcr, 
is zero. Figure 7 shows the equivalent circuit of Mode II. 
The state equations of Mode II are obtained according to 
the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.7.

Resonant capacitor discharges. At the instant resonant 
capacitor voltage Vcr(t) declines from zero to negative, the 
diode inside the main switch, S, will enter the on state. The 
circuit works in Mode III when the main switch, S, is 
switched to the on state. The working time T2 during Mode 
II can be derived by boundary condition Vcr(t2)=0, as in Eq.

When Mode VII starts, the main switch is off, the

state, diode D is conducted and the voltage across the 
resonant capacitor voltage is Vcr. At t6, diode D is 
beginning to conduct, and input inductor current, ii,

VI. DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED CHARGER 
A prototype boost converter with the ZVT PWM 
topology was constructed in a laboratory to verify its 
functions. The proposed charging circuit was connected to 
a 12V, 48Ah lead-acid battery. Table I presents the 
experimental circuit parameters for the proposed 
high-efficiency battery charger with a boost ZVT PWM 
converter. These analyses include circuit simulations using 
IsSpice software, and practical implementation of the 
proposed charger. Finally, simulation and practical results 
are compared. 
The saturated voltage for charging the battery was about 
15V. The battery was discharged to below 10V and then 
charged to about 12.8V because of the internal chemical 
treatment in the lead-acid battery. The terminal voltages 
across the battery, terminal voltage across the charger, 
charging current and output power were recorded at 
30-second intervals. Figure 14 shows a schematic of the 
circuit of the proposed battery charger. Circuit parameters 
were input voltage VS = 10V, output voltage VO = 15V, 
output current IO =8.6A and switching frequency fS = 80

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This work developed a novel battery charger with a boost 
ZVT PWM converter for decreasing switching loss and 
enhances charging efficiency. Experimental results 
obtained by charging a lead-acid battery demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach, indicating that the 
two switches in the proposed battery charger are operated 
at zero-voltage-switching. Constant-frequency operation, 
reduced resonance time, small components and small 
circuit volumes can be achieved. A significant decrease in 
the working temperature of switches, significant decrease 
in heat loss and markedly increase in charging efficiency 
were attained by reducing resonant time. The charging 
efficiency curve shows that the mean charging efficiency 
was 91.25%, indicating high charging efficiency. Moreover, 
the proposed charger also prevents an initial voltage 
established by the battery before the switches are turned on 
from remaining on the resonant capacitor, ensuring that the 
proposed circuit can control circuit operations relatively 
precisely.
