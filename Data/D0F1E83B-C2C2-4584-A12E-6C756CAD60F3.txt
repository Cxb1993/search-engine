Abstract 
This research work is based on the electrospun titania nanofiber materials recently 
developed in our research group.  The polymer-assisted electrospinning of the titania precursor 
was adopted for making the unique nanofiber with diameters less than 100 nm, which were 
further treated with the calcination process to complete the formation of oxide nanomaterials.  In 
comparison with the traditional titania materials, electrospun titania nanofibers exhibited the 
same properties in the water photolysis.  Electrospun titania nanofibers provided not only the 
extremely high surface-to-volume ratios, the fiber spacing also allowed the easy liquid/gas 
exchanges.  More importantly, the light harvesting effects observed in the electrospun titania 
fibers significantly increased the absorption and conversion of irradiation energy.  Enhancement 
of hydrogen productions in this research project will be further conducted by the external bias 
and the EG modification of titania materials to expand the irradiation absorption from UV to 
visible region.

2.2 Fabrication of PVP/TTIP nanofibers 
A TTIP sol-gel solution was prepared by mixing acetic acid 3mL and ethanol 2mL, followed by the 
addition of TTIP 3mL.  Acetic acid was added to moderate the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of 
TTIP.  The sol-gel solution was enclosed and stirred in a beaker for 15 minutes.  The electrospinning 
solution was completed by adding a solution containing PVP 0.42g and milliliters of ethanol.  PVP was 
employed to assist the electrospinning process of nanofibers.  The resulting slightly yellow solution was 
transparent and showed no precipitation after 1 hour stirring.  To control the nanofiber diameters, various 
amounts of ethanol in polymer solution were summarized. 
The polymer-based sol-gel solution was loaded in a syringe equipped with a 21 gauge stainless 
needle, and a syringe pump was utilized to provide the constant flow rate at 30μL/min.  The high voltage 
source was set at 10 kilo-volts, and the copper foil covered with iron grids was employed as the grounded 
counter electrodes, which were kept at a distance of 10cm away from the metal orifice.  The 
electrospinning processes were carried out at room temperature and under atmosphere.  
2.3 Fabrication of TiO2 photoelectrode 
TiO2 thin films were synthesized on FTO (SnO2: F) glass substrates (size: 2.5cm × 1cm × 0.23cm) by 
spray pyrolysis deposition method [8].  Acetylacetone 20g was dropwise added into TTIP 28.4g in 
three-neck bottle purged with nitrogen continuously.  As the substrate was heated to 500oC, the source 
solution diluted with ethanol (5vol%) was spurted from a nozzle with compressed nitrogen and the mist 
deposited onto the FTO glass substrate (area: 1cm × 1cm).  The distance between the nozzle and the 
substrate was kept at 150mm.  The period for each spraying was fixed at 10s, and the same procedure 
was carried out 3 times to fabricate desire thicknesses of TiO2 blocking layer. 
Next, one of the electrospinning solutions, ef12-20, was prepared, and the solution was diluted by 
40mL ethanol and stirred for 10 minutes.  To fabricate the prefabrication layers, the above substrates were 
spin-coated with the diluted solution by 3000 rpm for 30s.  The method was utilized to enhance adhesion 
between TiO2 nanofibers and the substrate.  Subsequently, PVP/TTIP nanofibers were electrospun on the 
above substrate, and the thickness was controlled by the period of electrospinning time.  The above 
samples were calcined by heating rate of 2.5oC/min to reduce the shrink of fibers, held at 450oC in air for 3 
hours, and cooled to room temperature.  The calcination process was utilized to eliminate the organic 
components and to complete the crystallization of TiO2 nanofibers.

3.2 Photocatalytic Performance (Photocurrent) 
Photocurrent of TiO2 nanofibers electrodes were characterized in a three electrodes system with 1M 
KCl as electrolyte under 36W UV light (major wavelength = 365nm, TUV-36W, PHILIP) irradiation.  The 
photocurrents of TiO2 nanofiber electrodes were scanned at a scan rate of 50mV/s and record by the 
potentiostat (Galvanostat: Autolab, type ) from Ⅲ -0.3V to 1V.  The maximum output power per unit area 
was calculated from the J-V curve.  Figure 5 shows the maximum output power of ef12-20 under various 
irradiation working distances (WD).  The maximum output power of each sample was normalized by fiber 
weight and BET surface area, and the results were shown in Figure 6.  Because of light propagation in 
fiber mats, the power linearly increased with the deposition thicknesses without saturation.  The trend 
lines of power normalized by fiber weight or BET surface area almost overlapped at a line except ef12-50.  
It was owing to the scattering peak of ef12-50 covered the absorption of TiO2 and it led to higher power and 
more effective absorption of UV light.

4、 Conclusion 
The linear correlation between scattering peak and TiO2 fiber diameters was in a good agreement 
with the Mie scattering theory.  Additionally, by drawing the trend line, the refractive index of spherical 
particles might be estimated.  Photocatalytic activities were enhanced by light propagation in fiber 
structure.  The normalized maximum output power was linearly proportional to the fiber weight and BET 
surface area without saturation.  Resulted from the absorption of UV light enhanced by light propagation, 
ef12-50 showed the better photocatalytic activities in performance of photocurrent and hydrogen 
production.

nanofibers with extremely high aspect ratios and specific
surface areas. Considerable grain boundaries may affect
the charge mobility and recombination.29 However, the
unique one-dimensional ZnO nanomaterials still demon-
strated their potential applications in photocatalysts,30 opto-
electronics,29,31 photovoltaics,32 and sensors.33
In this study, a novel electrospinning formula containing a
polyanion, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), was developed for the
direct fabricationof polycrystallineZnOnanotubes.Different
frommost electrospinning recipes, the anionicmacromolecule
was simultaneously employed as the electrospinning carrier
and the zinc counterion. Diameters of electrospun Zn2þ/PAA
nanofibers were successfullymanipulated by solution concen-
trations. Zinc ions associated with vinyl-COO- (vi-COO-)
groups in solidified PAAnanofiberswere thermally converted
to ZnO species, which ultimately constructed the outer layers
of nanotubes. The decompositions of Zn2þ/vi-COO- and
polymer residues as a function of calcination temperature
revealed the mechanism of hollow-structure formation.
Morphologies of ZnO nanotubes, including outer/inner dia-
meters, tube thicknesses, and grain sizes, were also examined.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of polycrystallineZnOnano-
tubes illustrated the typical UV and green emissions at 380
and 530 nm. Possible defects from trace carbons and oxygen
vacancies are also discussed.
Experimental Section
The poly(acrylic acid) (Mw=450 000) and zinc acetate dehydrate
used in this work were purchased fromAldrich.Metallic zinc (coarse
powder) was supplied from Riedel-del Haen. ZnO powder was
purchased from Kojundo Chemical Lab Co., Ltd. The thermal
decomposition of Zn2þ/PAA nanofibers was measured by thermo-
gravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments TGA2050) with a heating rate
of 10 C/min under ambient atmosphere. X-ray diffraction patterns
were measured by a Rigaku D/MAX X-ray diffractometry (XRD,
using Cu KR radiation) with a diffraction angle ranging from 20 to
80 and a scan rate of 0.05/s. The morphologies of the nanofibers
and nanotubes were examined by scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM, Philips XL-40FEG) and transmission electronmicroscopy
(TEM, JEOL JEM-2100 or Hitachi HF-2000). Photoluminescence
spectra were collected using a Jobin Yvon-Labram HR micro-PL
system with an excitation wavelength at 325 nm.
Metallic zinc as the metal-oxide precursor was chemically dis-
solved in a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) aqueous solution. The saturation
of zinc ions in the PAA solution took more than 72 h with vigorous
stirring at room temperature. Unlike zinc acetate, vinyl-COO-
(vi-COO-) groups on PAApolymer chains raised the localized anion
concentration and restricted further association with the metal
cations. As a result, the maximum Zn2þ loading in a PAA aqueous
solution was measured to be only 1:11.3 by weight (zinc/PAA), with
an equilibriumof 1:10.2molar ratio ofZn2þ to vi-COO- groups.Any
attempt to increase zinc ion concentration in the saturatedZn2þ/PAA
aqueous solution, such as by the addition of the zinc acetate, resulted
in instantaneous solid precipitation. The use of lowmolecular weight
PAA accelerated the zinc power dissolution but did not increase the
maximum Zn2þ concentration loading.
Seven Zn2þ/PAA aqueous solution samples were prepared for the
electrospinning. As summarized in Table 1, the Zn2þ/PAA ratios
were maximized for all samples. Solid concentrations of these
aqueous solutions were carefully diluted and adjusted from 5 to
11 wt % and labeled with ZA05 to ZA11, respectively. The electro-
spinning apparatus and process have been previously reported in
detail.17 Briefly, a Zn2þ/PAA aqueous solution was loaded in a
gastight syringe equipped with a stainless needle. A high-voltage
source of 10 kV was connected to the needle. At a distance of 15 cm
away from the metal orifice, a grounded copper electrode was
covered with plastic grids as the collecting substrate. Steady ejections
were controlledusing a syringe pumpat the desired ejection flow rates
from 2.8 to 12 μL/min, and were individually manipulated for each
sample (Table 1). For solutions with low solid concentrations, for
example, samples ZA05 and ZA06, high flow rates were required to
deliver enough solid materials for fiber formation. For concentrated
solutions, for example, samples ZA10 and ZA11, the critical charge
accumulation under the same applied voltage favored low ejection
flow rates to ensure that the droplet at the ejection nozzle could
overcome the surface tension and deform into a conical shape.34
As-spun Zn2þ/PAA fibers collected on plastic grids were dried under
a vacuum for 4 h and stored in a desiccator to reduce exposure to
moisture.
Zn2þ/PAA nanofibers were removed from the plastic grids, and
placed in a crucible for the calcination process. The calcination for
sample ZA10 was initiated in air using a crucible heated at a
temperature ramp of 20 C/min, followed by separate four-hour
isothermal treatments at 300, 350, 400, 500, 700, and 900 C(details in
Table 2). Electrospun Zn2þ/PAA nanofibers with varying fiber
diameters (sample ZA05 to ZA11) were calcined at a fixed tempera-
ture of 400 C.
Results and Discussion
Zinc atoms ionically associated with vi-COO- groups
were homogeneously dispersed in both aqueous media and
solidified nanofibers. Although Zn2þ/vi-COO- had a relati-
vely lowmolar ratio (1:10.2), the glass transition temperature
of PAA, originally at 128 C, was found to be completely
eliminated in the as-spun Zn2þ/PAA nanofibers (sample
ZA10), as indicated by differential scanning calorimetry
measurements (data no shown). It was believed that well-
dispersed zinc ions, which acted as counterions at low con-
centrations, considerably altered the behavior of PAA main
chain mobility. Direct evidence of the interaction between
Zn2þ and vi-COO- was observed in the infrared spectra
(Figure 1). Other than the original carbonyl stretching at

The room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of
the fournanotube samples inpowder formweremeasuredand
are shown in Figure 8. Similar to commercial ZnO, two PL
emission bands corresponding to polycrystalline ZnO nano-
tubes were observed. The first PL peak is a UV emission peak
at about 380 nm (3.25 eV), which corresponds to near-band-
edge emission resulting from free exciton recombination.37
The second peak is a broad green emission centered at about
530 nm (2.33 eV), which is attributed to the recombination of
photogeneratedholeswith electrons in singlyoccupiedoxygen
vacancies.38
For comparison purposes, UV emission bands at 380 nm
were adjusted to the same scale as shown in Figure 8. TheUV
emissionof sampleZA11-400 centered at 381nmwas found to
be lower than the 395 nm emission peak reported for 600 C-
calcined ZnO nanofibers without hollow structures.21 As the
outer diameters of ZnO nanotubes became smaller, a blue-
shift of these UV emissions from 381 to 376 nm was also
observed. Presumably, the shift of near-band-edge emission
at maximum intensities was caused by different stresses
resulting from thermal expansion strain in the calcination
process.39,40 For the green emission bands, the ZnO nano-
tubes were observed to emit at 530 nm, which was lower than
the 560 nm emission peak reported for ZnO nanofibers
prepared from the electrospinning of a zinc acetate/PVA
solution.21 The superimposed spectra in Figure 8 illustrate

ABSTRACT 
 
A synthetic approach for the fabrications of Janus and 
Saturn colloids was demonstrated by the sequential 
embedment and surface modification of silica colloids.  
Electrospinning of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and 
poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (P4VP) blends produced polymer 
fibers with high specific surfaces for the colloid adsorption 
and embedment.  Colloid adsorption on fiber surfaces was 
established by the interaction between silanol and pyridine 
groups located on silica and P4VP, respectively.  The 
thermally-induced colloid embedding was precisely 
manipulated by the heat treatment, which allowed the 
uniform and controllable colloid embedding.  The exposed 
colloid surfaces were selectively modified by the chemical 
vapor deposition of silanes with desired functional groups, 
followed by labeling with magnetite or gold nanoparticles.  
Synthesis of bifunctional Janus and triblock Saturn colloids 
were demonstrated and discussed.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Particles with two hemispheres in different chemical, 
physical or geometric properties are often referred as Janus 
particles [1].  These particles carry not only two different 
functionalities, but also the spatial distribution on particle 
surfaces.  These kinds of colloids attracted significant 
attention because of their potential applications in dual-
functional devices, building materials for supra-structures 
[2][3], electronic papers [4], surfactants for pickling 
emulsions [5], biomaterials [6], photovoltaics, and nano-
probes [7][8].   
Efficient productions of Janus particles with desired 
two-hemispheric features are the crucial issues as reported 
elsewhere [1][9][10].  An instinctive method is to confine 
monodispersed colloids at the interface between two phases 
[11], followed by the functionalization of hemispheric 
surfaces individually.  To achieve the mass production, a 
large amount of surface area as the working substrates is 
needed.  Thus, a polymer-based electrospinning [11] 
technique was employed for the fabrication of polymer 
fibers, containing high surface-to-volume ratios.  The 
electrospinning process involves the utilizing an 
electrostatic attraction between a charged polymer medium 
and a ground electrode where a high voltage is applied in 
between (see the apparatus in Figure 1).  Electrospinning 
occurs when the surface tension and viscoelastic forces of a 
polymer medium is defeated by the electrical charge.  A 
highly charged polymer jet is then ejected and forms 
solidified nanofibers as the solvents evaporate. 
 
Figure 1: Electrospinning apparatus and process for the 
polymer fiber fabrications. 
In recent years, the electrospinning technique was 
utilized for the applications involving both colloids and 
polymeric fibers [12][13].  Thermally-induced embedding 
of colloids on the surfaces of polymer fibers was conducted 
to attach and stabilize colloids at air/polymer interfaces.  In 
the embedding process, controlling parameters included the 
embedding temperatures, the glass transition temperatures 
(Tg) of polymers, the adhesion between colloid/polymer 
interfaces, the attraction forces, and the thermodynamic 
factors [14].  
The temperature-sensitive embedding process between 
colloids and electrospun polymer fiber mats was carefully 
investigated.  It was important to control the polymer 
softening from the thermodynamic point of view, as well as 
to maintain the fiber morphologies without melting.  Once 
the colloid embedding process was completed, the exposed 
surfaces of embedded colloids were modified via the 
chemical vapor deposition of desired functional groups, so 
that a thin layer of nanoparticles could attach onto the 
modified surfaces.  Finally, colloids with symmetric or 
asymmetric functionality were retrieved by dissolving the 
polymer fiber mats in organic solvents.  
In this research work, two immiscible polymers, 
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(4-vinyl 
pyrdine) (P4VP), with opposite hydrophobic/hydrophilic 
properties were blended and dissolved in co-solvents of 
DMF/MEK.  Composite electrospun fiber mats provided 
stable scaffolds and a large amount of surface area to 
confine colloids.  Following colloid embedding was 
carefully manipulated by isothermal treatments at desired 
temperatures.  Colloid embedding at certain degrees can be 
achieved.  The exposed surfaces of embedded colloids were 
selectively modified by the chemical vapor deposition of 3-
aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (3-APTMS).  Uniform 
  
Figure 3: The adsorption of silica colloids on PMMA/P4VP 
fiber mats via a solution dipping process. 
According to the previous report [12], electrospun fibers 
consisted of PMMA and P4VP blends also had the 
advantage of broadening the colloid embedding degree as a 
function of heating temperatures.  Uniform colloid 
embeddings from 1/3 to 2/3 were achieved at the heating 
temperatures from 120oC to 150oC.  The phase separation in 
electrospun PMMA/P4VP fibers [18] was also carefully 
investigated.  The polymer domains in PMMA/P4VP fibers 
were found to be about 60 nm, which was much smaller 
than the diameter of silica colloids.  Therefore, the silica 
colloid adsorption on fiber surfaces showed no preference 
to the P4VP domains.  Presumably, the P4VP domains were 
responsible for the adsorption of silica colloids, and PMMA 
phase prevented the fiber softening from the solvent 
swelling.  Well-dispersed silica colloids in the aqueous 
suspensions prevented the formation of silica clusters.  
Therefore, extra silica colloids which did not directly attach 
to polymer fiber surfaces were easily removed by the 
solution washing process.  Interesting enough, the attached 
silica colloids tended to line-up along with the direction of 
electrospun polymer fibers.   
Silica colloid embedding on the surface of 
PMMA/P4VP fibers was manipulated by the isothermal 
temperatures.  As shown in Figure 4, the isothermal 
treatments at 120oC, 135oC, and 150oC resulted in the 1/3, 
1/2 and 2/3 colloid embedding, respectively.  At 120oC, 
PMMA/P4VP polymer fibers had reached the glass 
transition temperature of PMMA at about 115oC, which 
provided the initiation of polymer softening.  Continuous 
colloid embedding was further encouraged as the increase 
of heating temperature.  The half colloid embedding was 
achieved at the isothermal temperature at 135oC, which was 
between the two glass transition temperatures of PMMA 
and P4VP.  Above the glass transition temperature of P4VP 
domain at about 145oC, the significant polymer softening 
gave the 2/3 colloid embedding.   
After the colloid embedding process, the CVD surface 
modification by using the amino-silane was conducted to 
complete the hemispheric surface coating.  Electrospun 
fiber mats were excellent 3-dimensional scaffolds allowing 
the gas phase agents to pass through.  CVD process, 
therefore, ensured the uniform surface modification with 
desired silane thicknesses.  Similar advantage was also 
available in the solution washing process.   
     
Figure 4: Colloid embedding as a function of heating 
temperature.  (120oC, 135oC, and 150oC, respectively) 
Additional labeling with gold nanoparticles to the 
amino-enriched silica surfaces was carried out for the easy 
identification of surface functionalities on silica surfaces.  
Gold nanoparticles in an aqueous suspension were 
introduced to the hemispheric embedded silica colloids.  
Gold nanoparticles then were caught by the amino groups, 
which in fact illustrated the recognizable multiple surfaces 
in TEM images.   
Resulting colloids were recovered by dissolving the 
polymer fibers in the acetone/ethanol co-solvent, followed 
by the centrifuge separation.  Additional washing with the 
same co-solvent was conducted for five more times to 
ensure the removal of polymer residuals and other 
contaminations on colloid surfaces.  Figure 5 illustrated the 
TEM images of symmetric and asymmetric Janus colloids 
with gold nanoparticle attachment on 2/3 and 1/2 colloid 
surfaces.   
      
Figure 5: An asymmetric Janus colloid (left, 2/3 surface-
functionalized) and a symmetric Janus colloid (right, 1/2 
surface-functionalized). 
Statistics for the colloid submerging was estimated by 
analyzing the diameters of exposed hemispheres in the 
SEM images.  For the 1/2 embedded colloids, the diameters 
of silica hemispheres with observable submerged margins 
were outlined and measured.  Even thought the margins of 
colloids with less than 50 % submerging were theoretically 
not observable in SEM images, this analytical approach 
provided practical statistic accuracy.  Based on the 
evaluation of more than 200 submerged colloids, it was 
found that 90 % of exposed hemispheres contained the 
diameters in the range of 500 ± 25 nm, i.e. within 5 % 
tolerance.  Meanwhile, due to the large fiber surface area 
and the uniform colloid adsorption on fiber surfaces, it was 
then calculated that more than 109 silica colloids could be 
embedded from 1 mg of electrospun polymer fibers in this 
high productive fabrication approach.   
Using this novel colloid embedding and surface 
modification process, tri-block Saturn colloids can be also
