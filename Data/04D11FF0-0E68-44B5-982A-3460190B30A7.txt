Abstract - Novel microstrip bandpass filters with comb­
loaded resonators are proposed. With comb-loaded resonators, 
the proposed bandpass filter can have a wide passband. In 
particular, dual pass bands show up around 2.45 GHz and 5.75 
GHz and their bandwidth is 780 MHz. In addition, by properly 
controlling passband's coupling coefficient, two passbands' 
bandwidths of the dual-passband bandpass filter will be 
controlled properly. Finally, the agreement between measured 
results and the theoretical prediction validates the proposed 
structure. 
Index Terms - Wide-passband bandpass filter, bandpass filter, 
comb-loaded resonator. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Owing to the new WLAN standard [1], composed of 
IEEES02.llb/g (2.45 GHz) and IEEE S02.lla (5.2-5.S GHz), 
dual-band bandpass filters have attracted much attention. 
Moreover, dual-passband bandpass filters are key components 
at the front end of a concurrent dual-band receiver. 
There are several studies on dual-passband filters [2]-[5]. In 
order to obtain dual passbands, the planar dual-band bandpass 
filters [2] compose of two conventional circuits designed 
individually. Unfortunately, extra impedance matching 
networks may result in a large circuit size. The frequency­
selective resonators [3], [4] and stepped impedance resonators 
(SIRs) [5] are also employed to design dual-passband filters. 
Recently, the developments of commercial radio frequency 
front-end circuits are greatly in want of wide dual-passband 
bandpass filters with compact size and low insertion loss. As 
shown in Fig. 1, the filter with comb-loaded resonators is 
proposed in current paper to generate wide dual passbands. 
Moreover, the design examples, fabricated circuits, and 
measured results of 2.45/5.75-GHz dual-passband bandpass 
filters are also provided.

II. FILTER DESIGN 
The exemplary filters in this paper are fabricated on Rogers 
R04003. The substrate's dielectric constant, loss tangent, and 
thickness are 3.55, 0.0027, and 0.50S mm, respectively . .fi and 
.12 are the central frequencies of dual passbands; moreover, 
they are selected at 2.45 and 5.75 GHz , respectively. 
Fig. 2 shows the relationship between .I2ifi, and the finger 
number with fixed finger width, LI as 13 mm, WI as 0.3 mm, 
Lc as 1.3 mm, and Gd as 0.7 mm. It indicates that the larger the 
finger number is, the greater the.l2ifi is. Moreover, the vale of 
.I2ifi can be adjusted by the comb-loaded resonator's finger 
length, finger width or finger number. However, when the 
finger number is larger than S, the rising rate would slow 
down with smoother curve. As a result,.I2ifi is obtained as 
2.347, and then S and 0.3 mm are chosen as the finger number 
and finger width We, respectively.

two passbands are set at 2.45 and 5.75 GHz, respectively. 
Fractional bandwidth 111 and 112 for two passbands are chosen 
as 32% and 11.5%, respectively. Moreover, 0.1 dB is selected 
for the ripple of the four-ordered prototypical Chebyshev 
lowpass filter. 
The coupling coefficient KI2 or K34 of the first and second 
passband are 0.2659 and 0.0955, respectively. Consequently, 
gap GI2 can be then obtained as 0.2 mm. Similarly, the 
coupling coefficients K23 of the first and second passband are 
0.21 and 0.0756, respectively. Then, gap G23 and distance S 
can be obtained as 0.2 and 6 mm, respectively. Moreover, the 
external quality factor Qel or Qen of the first and second 
passband are 3.465 and 9.642, respectively. Distance tl and t2 
can be consequently obtained as 5.95 and 6.45 mm, 
respectively. As a result, the proposed dual-passband 
bandpass filter can be fabricated as Fig. 5, with overall size of 
33.6 mm x 4.4 mm. Specifically the layout of the fabricated 
dual-passband bandpass filter is shown in Fig. 5(a), and its

Fig. 5(b) also exhibits EM simulated and measured results 
of the dual-passband bandpass filter with greater bandwidth in 
the first passband. In terms of the measured results, within the 
first passband, 2.1-2.794 GHz, the insertion loss is smaller 
than 1.25 dB while the return loss is greater than 12.5 dB. 
Likewise, within the second passband, 5.44-6.05 GHz, the 
insertion loss is smaller than 2.6 dB while the return loss is 
greater than 10.5 dB. In addition, transmission zeros are 
located at 1.645, 3.868, 4.967, and 6.478 GHz, all around 
passband skirt. The measurement and EM simulation, with 
transmission zeros appearing at 1.64, 3.94, 4.91, and 6.49 
GHz, match welL Furthermore, the group delay within the 
first and second passband is smaller than 1.6 and 1.8 ns, 
respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Bandpass filters have been widely used in many microwave 
and wireless communication systems. Planar filters with 
printed circuit technology are particularly attractive because 
of their easy fabrication, compact size, and low cost [1]. Due 
to its planar structure and easy design procedures, the parallel­
coupled microstrip bandpass filter has been one of the most 
commonly used filters for the RF front end. However, the 
general disadvantage of the conventional microstrip parallel 
coupled filter is that the first spurious passband appears at 
twice of the basic passband frequency. As a result, the 
rejection of the upper stopband is worse than that of the lower 
stopband. 
Various methods have been developed to improve the 
stopband performance of a planar microwave bandpass filter. 
The sinusoidal rule is used to eliminate spurious harmonics by 
continuously perturbing the width of the coupled lines in the 
microstrip wiggly-line filter [2]. In [3] and [4], using 
capacitors to slow down the odd-mode phase velocity. In 
addition, with the stepped-impedance resonators in planar 
microstrip bandpass filters [5]-[7], the second harmonic can 
shift to a higher frequency band and a wide stopband will 
appear. Moreover, harmonic suppression can be carried out as 
well by employing the split-ring resonator [8], the open stub 
and spurline [9], [10], and the ground-plane aperture [11], 
[12]. 
In this paper, we propose a novel microstrip bandpass filter, 
as shown in Fig. I. With the assistance of open stubs and one 
open-circuit coupled line using symmetrical feeding, the 
harmonic resonance is suppressed and a wider stopband 
comes up. Following are the detail derivation and 
development of this filter. In Section II, we present the 
procedures for synthesizing the wide-stopband bandpass filter. 
Section III introduced the electromagnetic (EM) simulation 
978-1-4244-7732-6/10/$26.00 ©201 0 IEEE 1704 
and measurement results of the proposed filter. Section IV is

II. DESIGN EQUA nONS 
The proposed wide stopband microstrip bandpass filter can 
be simplified as shown Fig. 2(a). This simplified filter is 
composed of two open stubs and one open-circuit coupled line 
with symmetrical feeding to generate multiple transmission 
zeros. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2(a) 
can be obtained by using the immittance inverter [13].

Abstract - A novel microwave balun with three coupled lines 
is provided in this paper. With broadside coupling and edge 
coupling among three coupled lines, the proposed balun is 
compact and a wide operating frequency range is obtained. At a 
central frequency of 2.45 GHz, this balun is fabricated on the 
FR4 printed circuit board and with overall size of 1.5 mm x 1.2 
mm. The prototypical balun is simulated with the full-wave 
electromagnetic simulator IE3D. A good match between 
simulated and measured results validates the proposed balun. 
Index Terms - Balun, three coupled lines. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The miniaturization and cost reduction of RF components 
are important issues in wireless and mobile communication 
systems. Baluns are utilized to transform an unbalanced input 
port into balanced output ports. Moreover, there are various 
applications in microwave circuits such as balanced mixers, 
antenna feeds, push-pull amplifiers, multipliers, and phase 
shifters. Recently, Marchand balun [1] become popular 
because of the excellent performance at the balanced ports 
over a wide frequency range. The Marchand balun consists of 
two quarter-wavelength coupled lines that can be realized by 
microstrip coupled lines [2], Lange couplers [3], spiral coils [4] 
or multilayered coupled lines [5]. However, the Marchand 
balun with two quarter-wavelength coupled lines is not 
compact enough. 
In order to obtain a compact balun, three octant-wavelength 
coupled lines are adopted in this paper. As shown in Fig. 1, 
both broadside coupling and edge coupling are integrated into 
the newly proposed balun. Because the proposed balun is 
modified from the Marchand balun, transmission and 
reflection can be also employed for analysis, described in 
Sections II and III. Moreover, Section IV provides EM 
simulated and measured results of the newly developed 
compact balun. Our conclusion is given in Section V. 
II. CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS 
Comparing with the traditional Marchand balun, the newly 
proposed balun has the same characteristics. Therefore, the 
transmission and reflection properties of this balun are similar 
to those of the coupler with open and shorted terminals [6].

wavelength coupled lines. It also shows the coupling scheme. 
According to Fig. 2, the shorted terminal results in an anti­
phase total reflection while the open terminal causes an in­
phase total reflection. When a signal applies at port 1, part of 
the signal couples to the shorted terminal, it results in a 
portion of the signal totally reflects in anti-phase, and reaches 
at port 2. As a result, there is a voltage wave to port 2. 
Consequently, the coefficients of the total transmission from 
port 1 to port 2 and 3 are:

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Two couplers with three octant-wavelength coupled lines 
constitute the proposed balun. Moreover, both the broadside 
coupling and edge coupling are integrated into the coupler 
with three coupled lines because odd-even, even-even, and 
odd-odd excitation can be observed in this coupler [7). 
Therefore, the proposed balun is quite compact and can be 
operated in a wide frequency range. 
The newly developed balun is fabricated at the central 
frequency of 2.45 GHz and on Substrate FR4. This substrate's 
dielectric constant, loss tangent, dielectric thickness, and 
metal thickness are 4.3, 0.018, 0.76 mm, and 0.02 mm, 
respectively. Moreover, coplanar waveguide (CPW) is utilized 
for feeding at three ports, as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, 
Table II presents the dimensions of the fabricated balun.
