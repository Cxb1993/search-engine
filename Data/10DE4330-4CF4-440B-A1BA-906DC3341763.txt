Abstract 
In the past 10 years, Bio-MicroElectro 
Mechanical Systems (Bio-MEMS), Lab-On-
a-Chip (LOC) and Micro-Total Analysis 
Systems (μ-TAS), with several applications 
have attracted tremendous attention. Among 
these, the micro-mixer for Bio-MEMS, LOC 
and μ-TAS is one of the most important 
components for ensuring the success in 
miniaturization. In this final project report we 
have designed and manufactured using 
Polydimethylsiloxane  (PDMS) processing 
several different types of micro-channels,  
bonding with thermal bubble heater, become 
an actuated micro-mixer. In-house developed 
micro-PIV system is then used to visualize 
the mixing and measure the velocity 
distribution within the channels at different 
flow conditions. Results show that a thermal 
bubble-actuated micro-pumping system that 
is succeed in coupled to the micro-channels, 
is used to further enhance the mixing effect.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
1-1 PASSIVE MICROMIXER 
The micromixer is an important 
component in a microfluidic system. The 
goal is to arrive at a homogeneous blend of 
the solutions in as little time as possible. 
However, the low Reynolds number laminar 
flow precludes turbulence. Even at small 
length scales of microns, intermolecular 
diffusion of macromolecules too slow to 
have effective mixing in small length of time 
scales. These factors make micromixing a 
challenging process to achieve. Thus, it is an 
important topic to design a high effect and 
stable micro-mixer. 
The generality of passive micromixers are 
designed a T-Shape microchannel with 
chaotic advection, such as zig-zag-shaped 
channel [1], 3D-L-shape channel [2] and 
groove patterns [3]. In those micromixers, 
Stroock et al [4] used two different groove 
patterns, can work well at a Reynolds 
number range from 1 to 100 and the traveling 
length is about 3cm (Re=10-2) as fig. 1. 
There are some parameters that are 
important for describing mixing effect as 
follows. 
The primary parameter of all Newtonian 
fluids is the dimensionless Reynolds number, 
defined as 
μ
ρ Vdl=Re                    (1)

In the present experiment, we re-equip a 
micro-PIV from original PIV system, have 
the Nd:Yag double pulsed laser with 532 nm 
wavelength that is used as the light source, 
presents in Figure 3. For the measurement of 
velocity of a fluid, tracer particles are seeded 
in the flow. Besides, we use the ink as an 
indicator, in order to observe mixing effect 
when begin to get an image of mixing 
phenomenon. 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 4 shows the mixing phenomenon 
for a spiral rectangle channel: from left-top 
corner inlet and right-bottom corner outlet, 
width 50μm, depth 50μm and total length of 
microchannel is about 7.3mm. 
Figure 5 shows the spiral triangle channel, 
the dimensions is the same as the spiral 
rectangle channel. We find that the spiral 
corner can extend the effect of diffusion. 
Especially, near the inner position of channel 
is extremely obvious. However, there has a 
strange phenomenon that the mixed fluid will 
be separated when the fluid past the inner 
position of channel as the low Reynolds 
number. 
We find that the effect of diffusion is 
inversely proportional to Reynolds number. 
In other words, high Reynolds number will 
be adverse the mixing effect in microchannel. 
Therefore, the active microfluidic 
components, such as micro-thermal bubble 
pump not only a pumping device but also a 
mixing device. 
Figure 6 shows the pumping processes 
(from (a) to (d) processing) when the bubble 
pumping from the chamber to the outlet. The 
petal-type heater had a great effect upon the 
mixing with a “big” bubble. The flow rate is 
about 6μl /min when the pulse duty is 5% 
and the pulse frequency is 300Hz. According 
the model developed by Olsson et al. [6], the 
volume flow rate Q  of nozzle-diffuser 
pumps can be modeled as

Where lV  is the liquid volume in the 
chamber, f  is the pulse frequency,  nε  is the 
coefficient of pressure loss of the nozzle, and 
dε  is the coefficient of pressure loss of the 
diffuser. 
Another case is similar to single-bubble 
mode (the meander-type heater) of Tsai et al. 
[8] shows as Figure 7. The flow rate is about 
5 μl /min when the pulse duty is 5% and the 
pulse frequency is 300Hz. Compare with the 
thermal bubble pumping effect, the petal-
type heater is better than the meander-type 
heater in the same operating conditions. 
Figure 8 shows the pumping processes of a 
coil-type heater. It is easy to accumulate the 
heat energy that induces the heater 
breakdown.  
Finally, we designed a ring-type heater and 
hope to concentrate the heat energy in the 
ring tip shows in Figure 9. The result shows 
that the thermal bubble is small. We need to 
adjust a best parameter for effect 
optimization in the pulse duty and frequency. 
However, further tests are required to prove 
this. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 In the current study, we have designed and 
manufactured several different types of 
channels and observed experimentally the 
mixing at different conditions to combine 
with thermal bubble heater. Results show that 
the mixing using petal-type heater 
outperforms other types of heaters. The 
results of the experiment can provide for the 
designed rules.
