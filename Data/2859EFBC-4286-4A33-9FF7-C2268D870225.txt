2. Datasets 
The SELDI data we study in this article are obtained from Medical College of 
Georgia, USA. The technology of SELDI is used to detect proteins in tissue, blood, or 
other clinical samples. The generated data from spectrometer are represented by a two 
dimensional spectrum. The X-axis is the value of mass per charge (m/z), and the Y-axis 
is the relative intensity of the ion measurement. The dataset contains 600 samples that 
come from eight different cancer diseases of patients and one control type of healthy 
individuals. The 600 samples are three replications for each person (see Table 1) and 
each spectrum has 60,479 dimensions that range from 8.5863719 to 100,301.63 m/z 
approximately.

3. Methods 
In order to deal with the problems of high dimensionality and noise on spectrum 
data, we implement a data preprocessing procedure before applying Fuzzy ART. The 
main steps of the procedure and the clustering approach of Fuzzy ART are introduced in 
this section. 
3.1 Data Preprocessing 
The data preprocessing procedure consists of five steps, which are baseline 
subtraction and normalization, quality assessment, smoothing and peak detection, peak 
alignment, and feature selection. Each step is briefly described as follows. 
Step 1. Baseline subtraction and normalization 
Due to the characteristic and limitation of the SELDI technology, the lower value 
of m/z data points consist the matrix peaks. The baseline subtraction is proposed to 
eliminate the noise and maintain the peaks in true intensities, and the normalization 
is used to eliminate any systematic effects between mass spectra.

Fuzzy ART is an enhanced version of ART1, and it is capable to deal with analog 
inputs. The difference between ART1 and Fuzzy ART algorithms is that ART1 uses an 
intersection (logical AND) operator ∩ , and Fuzzy ART uses a minimum (fuzzy AND) 
operator ∧ . The related equations for Fuzzy ART are shown below.

Moore [6] described a category proliferation problem that may occur when the 
number of inputs is large. Proliferation of categories is avoided if inputs are normalized 
as ,γ≡I  γ > 0 for all inputs I. There is a normalization rule called complement coding 
to avoid the proliferation problem. Let ( ),,,1 MaaI L=  where M is dimension of the

two groups of healthy individuals, nine persons are in cluster 2 and eleven persons are 
in cluster 1. We tune the vigilance ρ in the experiments to observe the group results of 
patients. Table 3 shows that the pattern of PCA versus P-CON is apparently separable 
between two groups of patients and healthy persons when ρ is 0.44, and the error ratio is 
close to the classification error ratio in Table 2. Similarly, the results of SCCA, CC, and 
RC in Tables 4, 6, and 10 are also separable between two groups of patients and healthy 
persons when the value of ρ are 0.51, 0.81, and 0.71, respectively. The result of BC in 
Table 5 is interesting, it seems that two groups of patients and healthy persons can not 
be divided into two clusters for different values of ρ. However, we can consider that it is 
still separable, if we assume that there is more than one prototype of BC cancer patients. 
For example, we note that there are six clusters produced when ρ is 0.94 in Table 5, if 
we consider clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4 are four different prototypes of BC cancer and 
clusters 5 and 6 are two prototypes of healthy persons, P-CON. Then, we can still 
identify the patients and the healthy persons with only one error in 40 patients. The 
similar results of HCC, LC and PAC can be observed in Tables 7, 8, and 9.

 In the final experiment, we mix all selected features from eight different types of 
cancer and find their common peaks by aligning their features. After alignment, there 
are 88 features are considered as the common peaks. We then apply Fuzzy ART to 
cluster the total 200 samples; the result is shown in Table 11. Although each cancer 
disease seems to have several prototypes, the separation for each type of cancer is not 
obviously.

 2.1 Simulated data set 
In the experiments, we used the simulated data set to compare the results of our approach with the 
averaging method. The advantage of using the simulated data set is that the true locations of peaks are 
known in each spectrum. The simulated data set consists of 100 subsets. Each subset represents a 
population which contains 100 simulated proteomics spectra form the same analytical sample. Each 
spectrum is described by two representations where one represents a raw spectrum from a mass 
spectrometry and the other represents its corresponding spectrum with true peaks. The detail 
description of the simulated data set can be found in and down loaded from Morris et al. (2005). 
2.2 Real data set 
The real data set of prostate cancer contains four groups of patients (see Table 1) and each patient 
has two replicates. We used the prostate cancer data set to compare the results of the classification 
using either the proposed DTW approach or the averaging method as a preprocessing step. The more 
detail description about the prostate cancer data set can be referred to (Adam et al. (2002)).

3 CAB 84 Early stage of cancer 
4 CCD 83 Late stage of cancer 
3 Dynamic Time Warping 
The algorithm of DTW uses the designing strategy of dynamic programming, which typically 
applies to optimization problem. In general, DTW is used to find an optimal match between two given 
trajectories. The trajectories are nonlinearly warped such that similar events are aligned in the time 
dimension and a minimum dissimilarity measure is achieved. In this section, we first introduce the 
DTW algorithm, and then present our proposed DTW approach. 
3.1 The DTW algorithm 
Basic concept 
Let T and R denote two trajectories with lengths t and r, respectively, where t and r are the number 
of observations on the time axis. For example, Figure 1 shows two trajectories with different lengths 8 
and 7. Let i and j denote the time indexes of the T and R trajectories, respectively. The procedure of 
DTW is to determine a warping path F, which is a mapping of two trajectories T and R on a common 
time axis 
F = { c(1), c(2), …, c(k) , …, c(K)},  max (t, r) ≤ K ≤ t + r 
where 
c(k) =[i(k), j(k)].

 global constraints, Itakura global constraint and Sakoe-Chiba band constraint, are shown in Figures 
3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The shaded regions are the allowable spaces for finding the shortest path. 
Figure 3: Two Typical Global Constraints 
 
Global constraints are used to ensure that the found path stays close to the diagonal of the rectangle 
region containing t X r points. This restriction avoids those undesired ways of warping that align a 
small portion in one trajectory to a large portion in the other. A more detailed discussion of DTW can 
be found in (Itakura (1975), Sakoe and Chiba (1978)). 
3.2  Synchronization of proteomics data using DTW 
In this section, we will apply the features of proteomics data to modify DTW for solving the 
problem of synchronization. To do this, we first explain how to normalize intensities locally before 
applying a local distance function d[·, ·], then establish a global constraint that fits characters of 
proteomics data, and lastly conquer the difficulty that the combined sequence will be stretched after 
synchronization. 
Intensity normalization 
Before explaining why we need to normalize intensities locally, we may see an example of 
proteomics data first. In Figure 4, there are two mass spectra, which are prostate cancer data from a 
single patient. The x-axis here can be considered as time dimension and the y-axis is the intensity. Our 
aim of synchronization is to correct mass spectra for shifts in the time axis and combine them into a 
single spectrum. The warping process is to produce a spectrum which is similar to those two spectra 
the most. The measure of dissimilarity may be referred to as distance. A small distance is equivalent to 
a large similarity. The Euclidean distance is a common choice for the local distance. However, 
applying the Euclidean distance directly is not suitable for the similarity of two mass spectra. For 
proteomics data, the mass spectra are considered similar if they have similar pattern. From Figure 4, 
we can observe that the wave shapes of two mass spectra are very similar in the location around scale 
4900, although their intensities are quite different at that scale. If we use the Euclidean distance as a 
609
 modified as [7.5, 7.5] ≈ [8, 8]. After the projection, the combined sequence (optimal path) and two 
input sequences all have the same length.

4 Experimental results 
In order to evaluate the proposed DTW approach described in Section 3.2, experiments were 
conducted on a simulated data set (Morris et al. (2005)) and a real data set of prostate cancer (Adam et 
al. (2002)). The averaging method was selected to compare with our approach in the experiments. 
4.1 Simulated data set 
The simulated data set of known peak positions is used to evaluate the peak detection, since it 
provides the opportunity to determine the sensitivity, which is defined as the number of true peaks 
divided by the total number of identified peaks. The first subset of the simulated data was chosen in 
the experiments. As we have mentioned in Section 2, each subset contains 100 simulated proteomics 
spectra form the same analytical sample. These 100 mass spectra were combined by using our 
proposed DTW approach or the averaging method. There are two parameters in our approach, one is 
the window size, 2N + 1, for intensity normalization, the other is the parameter r % used to define the 
global constraint. Table 2 shows the results of sensitivity for peak detection. Since the averaging 
method has no parameters, there is only one result. For easy of comparison, the result is listed on each 
entry of the last row. The rest of rows indicate the sensitivity results for the sliding window with

5 Conclusions 
This study focuses on the development of an approach to synchronize two or more mass spectra 
from same analytical sample. The approach is a modified version of the DTW algorithm which is 
initially devised for aligning speech signals. However, DTW is not directly applicable to mass spectra 
such as proteomics data. Therefore several modifications are introduced in our proposed DTW 
approach. Firstly, we suggest normalizing local intensities before calculating a local distance. The 
normalization technique helps to recognize similar pattern of mass spectra. Secondly, we define a 
global constraint that agrees with the features of proteomics data. The searching area for an optimal 
path is restricted for not far away from the diagonal. Lastly, we solve the problem of the combined 
sequence having longer length than input sequences. 
The proposed DTW approach was implemented and compared with the averaging method. Both 
simulated and real data sets were used for experiments. The advantage of using simulated data set is 
that the true peaks are known and the performance of peak detection can be measured. A real data set 
of prostate cancer generated from SELDI was also used for experiments. The data set has four groups 
of patients and the classification results are used for comparison. We applied our approach and the 
averaging method separately for data preprocessing of synchronization. From the results of peak 
detection and classification, the performance of our proposed DTW approach was better than the 
averaging method. 
In summary, we presented an approach based on DTW algorithm for synchronization of 
proteomics data. Our approach outperformed the average method on both simulated and real data sets. 
There are still some points to improve in the proposed approach. For example, a more suitable 
definition of local function may enhance to extract similar features from pairs of mass spectra. We 
hope to improve the proposed approach in future studies and apply it to some other spectral data sets.
