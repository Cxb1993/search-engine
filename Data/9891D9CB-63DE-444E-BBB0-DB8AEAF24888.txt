轉換器則是以基本波傳輸能量，並藉由改變開
關的工作頻率來調節輸出電壓。然而，由於開
關元件的切換特性，因此不論 PWM 轉換器或
諧振轉換器皆屬於非線性系統，要建立精確的
小訊號數學模型並不容易。通常需先將非線性
系統線性化，再針對這個線性系統來作線性分
析以獲取小訊號模型，目前常用於小訊號建模
之線性化方法如下： 
1) 諧波平衡法[5]：此方法是對各狀態變數進
行傅立葉分析，並利用諧波平衡的理論，
推導出小訊號數學模型。此法不但適用於
PWM 轉換器，也適用於諧振式轉換器，但
由於數學運算過程較複雜，故未被廣泛使
用。 
2) 狀態空間平均法[6]：此方法將非線性系統
分割為數個線性系統，再乘上其在原系統
所佔的時間比例並相加，以得到原非線性
系統的近似化線性模型。此方法僅適用於
PWM 轉換器之小訊號模型推導，因為其輸
出濾波器的自然頻率遠低於開關切換頻率。
對諧振式轉換器而言，由於其開關切換頻
率通常與諧振頻率相近，因此並不適合以
狀態空間平均法來作線性化。 
3) 擴張描述函數法[7]：此方法由學者 E. X. 
Yang 於 1994 年，以描述函數法為基礎並結
合諧波平衡法所提出。其主要觀念是先列
寫出諧振轉換器之非線性狀態方程式，並
利用擴張描述函數法對其非線性部份進行
線性化處理，再以諧波平衡法獲取穩態模
型。最後，對此穩態模型加入小訊號擾動，
以獲取小訊號模型。由於此法結合時域和
頻域分析，其可直接獲得諧振轉換器的動
態響應特性，故已被應用於多種諧振轉換
器之小訊號模型推導[8], [9]。 
綜合以上論述，本計畫將選用擴張描述函
數法以建立 LLC 諧振轉換器之小訊號模型[10]，
並利用 IsSpice 模擬軟體得到小訊號頻率響應

圖4 LLC諧振轉換器的電壓增益曲線 
由圖 4 中的 fH、fL及曲線斜率，可將此圖
分成三個不同特性的操作區域。於區域 3 中，
雖然切換開關具有零電流切換(ZCS)截止的特
性，但是在開關切換導通的瞬間，突波電流將
導致開關電流應力增加及較高的切換損失與
雜訊，因此須避免將此轉換器操作於此區域
[11], [12]。 
區域 1 之電路操作原理與串聯諧振轉換器
相似，故切換開關具有零電壓切換(ZVS)導通
的特性。當 LLC 諧振式轉換器操作於區域 2
時，除了切換開關具有 ZVS 特性外，由於激磁
電感 Lm參與諧振，使得二次側整流二極體具有
ZCS 的特性[11], [12]，可有效降低切換損失以
提升系統效率，因此本計畫將滿載輸出之操作
點設計於區域 2 中。

Abstract—This paper proposes a novel single-stage LLC 
resonant ac-dc converter with power factor correction feature. 
The proposed circuit is the integration of a buck-boost type 
power factor corrector and an LLC resonant dc-dc converter. 
The proposed single-stage converter which has power factor 
correction and output voltage regulation features can simplify 
circuit complexity, reduce cost, and increase system reliability 
over conventional two-stage systems. Experimental results of a 
100W prototype are used to verify the feasibility and validity of 
the theoretical predictions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Electronic devices are generally driven by the dc voltage 
obtained from rectifying and smoothing the ac line voltage, 
which may induce current harmonic distortions and 
electromagnetic interference. In order to prevent the rectified 
current impacting power quality and increasing power 
dissipation of transmission line, there are many international 
standards, such as IEC61000-3-2 [1], to specify the criteria of 
current harmonics in the electronic applications. 
Passive filters are the simplest approach to suppress current 
harmonic distortions. But, bulky components and 
nonadjustable characteristics are their main disadvantages. 
Thus, inserting one active power factor corrector (PFC) [2] in 
the front end of dc-dc converters is the alternative and popular 
approach to reduce current harmonics and improve power 
factor. The system block diagram of this approach is shown in 
Fig. 1, which consists of two-stage converters. For a two-stage 
system, in spite of increasing size, cost and circuit complexity, 
power dissipation of additional energy processing results in 
lower system efficiency. To solve these problems, literatures 
[3-11] have proposed to operate the front end PFCs in 
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), and develop 
numerous single-stage converters by sharing power switches 
[12] with the back end converters. These single-stage 
converters have been successfully used in the applications of 
electronic ballast and dc power supply. 
In the researches of single-stage converters, if the back end 
converters belong hard switching operation, the integrated 
single-stage converter will be also operated in hard switching 
[5], [6]. In order to further improve system efficiency, various 
resonant converters [7-11], such as series resonant converter 
(SRC), parallel resonant converter (PRC), and series-parallel 
resonant converter (SPRC), are adopted as the back end 
converters to develop single-stage converters with soft 
switching operation. However, SRC, PRC and SPRC have the 
problems of output voltage regulation at light load and 
circulating energy. Therefore, the LLC resonant converter is 
proposed to overcome these problems [13-15]. Furthermore, 
literature [11] has integrated a boost type PFC and an LLC 
resonant dc-dc converter to develop a single-stage ac-dc 
converter with zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation. 
Fig. 1 Block diagram of a dc power system with an active PFC. 
When a boost converter is adopted as the PFC, the dc-bus 
voltage should be designed to be much higher than the 
magnitude of the ac input voltage to achieve a unity power 
factor. Therefore, the voltage rating of power components is 
increased, which results in higher cost and lower efficiency. 
To overcome this problem, literatures [5] and [8] propose to 
use buck-boost typed PFC, and successfully develop several 
single-stage high power factor electronic ballasts. Their dc-bus 
voltages are designed to be close to the magnitude of the ac 
input voltage. 
Considering above discussions, this paper proposes a novel 
single-stage LLC resonant ac-dc converter with power factor 
correction feature. The proposed converter is the integration of 
a buck-boost typed PFC and an LLC resonant dc-dc converter. 
The frequency modulation control is used for output voltage 
regulation, and the power factor correction can be naturally 
achieved by operating input inductor current in DCM. Due to 
saving a power switch and a controller, the circuit complexity 
can be simplified, and the system size and cost can be reduced. 
Furthermore, because of reducing one stage energy conversion 
and ZVS operation of power switches, the system efficiency 
can be significantly increased. Experimental results of a 100W 
prototype are used to verify the feasibility and validity of the 
theoretical predictions.

D. Mode 4 
This mode starts when iLr and iLm equal each other. Current 
circulating through the secondary diode D3 naturally decreases 
to zero so that this diode turns off under zero current switching 
(ZCS) condition. The voltage spike caused by diode reverse 
recovery would not exist. The voltage of Lm is no longer 
clamped to nVO, hence, Lm is in series with Lr and participates 
in the resonance with Cr in the resonant tank. The equivalent 
circuit of this mode is shown in Fig. 4(d). Because the 
equivalent inductance of (Lr + Lm) is much higher than Lr, as 
shown in Fig. 3, iLr and iLm are almost constant in this short 
time interval. 
E. Mode 5 
As shown in Fig. 4(e), while S1 is turning off, the resonant 
current iLr is charging COSS1 and discharging COSS2
simultaneously. At the moment of vds2 decreasing to zero, the 
resonant current iLr flows through anti-paralleled diode D2
which provide ZVS operation for S2 turn-on. At the same time, 
the secondary rectifier diode D4 turns on. The voltage of Lm is 
clamped to nVO with reverse polarity so that the current iLm
decreases linearly. The magnetizing inductor Lm is separated 
from the resonance with Cr. When S2 turns on under ZVS, this 
mode ends and enters the other half cycle with symmetrical 
operation principles. Besides, the voltage across the inductor 
Lpf is Vdc with reverse polarity so that the current iLpf becomes 
linear decreasing. The energy of Lpf is released to the capacitor 
Cdc through the diode Dpf.
F. Mode 6 ~ Mode 10 
The operation principles of modes 6 ~ 10 are almost 
similar to those of the first five modes. The main difference is 
the inductor current iLpf becomes linear decreasing instead of 
increasing. In order to achieve the power factor correction 
feature, iLpf must decrease to zero before S1 is turned on again. 
By the way, since the inductor current iLpf operates in DCM 
and the resonant current iLr flows through diode Df1 before S1
turning on, the turn-on loss of the switch S1 is negligible.

converter. 
III. ANALYSIS OF SINGLE-STAGE CONVERTER
A novel single-stage LLC resonant ac-dc converter 
proposed in this paper can fulfill power factor correction and 
output voltage regulation features simultaneously. Based on 
the operation principles presented previously, the functions of 
the original buck-boost converter and LLC resonant converter 
are remained, even they share the power switch S1. Therefore, 
the proposed single-stage converter is divided into a buck-
boost typed PFC and an LLC resonant dc-dc converter, and 
they can be analyzed separately. For simplifying the analysis, 
following conditions are made: 
1) All components are ideal. 
2) The dc-bus capacitor Cdc is large enough so that the 
voltage Vdc across it can be regarded as a constant voltage 
source. 
A. Buck-Boost Typed PFC 
As shown in Fig. 2, the buck-boost typed PFC is mainly 
formed with the upper switch S1 in the LLC resonant converter, 
the additional input inductor Lpf and diode Dpf. Without any 
additional current-shaped controller and by designing the 
inductor current iLpf operated in DCM, the input current can be 
shaped naturally to follow the input sinusoidal voltage to 
achieve high power factor. 
The input sinusoidal voltage can be expressed as

Fig. 7 Frequency response of voltage gain for the LLC resonant converter. 
According to ωH  and ωL, and slopes of curves, Fig. 7 can 
be divided into three operation regions. In region 3, because 
switching frequency is lower than resonant frequency, the 
impedance of resonant tank is capacitive, and the primary 
switches operate under ZCS condition. However, during turn 
on transient, the current spike will result in high current stress, 
high switching loss and noise. Therefore, this converter should 
be prevented from operating in this region [13-15]. 
In region 1, the switching frequency is higher than the main 
resonant frequency ωH. The impedance of resonant tank is 
inductive, and the switches can operate under ZVS condition 
to reduce switching loss. Since voltage gain (|MV|) is less than 
1, the converter could be regarded as buck type. The operation 
principle in this region is very similar to SRC; hence, 
secondary rectifier diodes cannot operate under ZCS. Voltage 
spike will occur during turn-off transient and result in lower 
efficiency. 
When the switching frequency is lower than the main 
resonant frequency ωH, the converter is operated in region 2 
and regarded as boost type (voltage gain Њ 1). Because the 
inductance of Lm is only slightly higher than Lr, and its voltage 
is clamped by output voltage, the inductor current iLm is 
increasing linearly during the main resonant period. While iLm
reaches the same level as the resonant current iLr, a second 
resonance with the frequency ωL determined by Cr and (Lr + 
Lm) will occur. This resonance will continue until the primary 
switches switching again so that the converter can still operate 
under ZVS in region 2. Besides, during the second resonant 
period, the current of secondary rectifier diodes remains zero; 
hence, they can turn off naturally under ZCS condition [13-15].  
Generally, the primary switches of LLC resonant converter 
can operate under ZVS condition both in region 1 and region 2. 
But the secondary rectifier diodes can only operate under ZCS 
condition in region 2. Therefore, the theoretically optimal 
converter efficiency should be obtained in the point of 
switching frequency equal to the second resonant frequency 
ωL. For practical considerations, in order to minimize power 
dissipation and prevent the operation point from entering 
region 3, the switching frequency of full load operation should 
be designed as slightly higher than resonant frequency ωL.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Based on previous analysis, a 100W prototype of the 
proposed single-stage LLC resonant ac-dc converter is 
implemented to verify the feasibility and validity of the 
theoretical predictions. The electrical specifications and 
component parameters are summarized in Table I.

Figure 8 shows the measured waveforms of the input line 
voltage and input current, respectively. It can be seen that the 
input current is sinusoidal and in phase with the input line 
voltage. The measured power factor is 0.98, and the measured 
efficiency is 86%. The proposed single-stage converter can 
significantly improve power factor and suppress current 
harmonic distortions. 
Figure 9 shows the measured waveforms of the primary 
switches S1 and S2 at full load condition. It could be observed 
that S1 and S2 can turn on under ZVS condition. Because of 
magnetic inductor Lm participating resonance, the switch 
current can be reduced at the turn-off transient. Therefore, the 
circulating energy and turn-off loss can be significantly 
minimized to improve system efficiency. Besides, due to the 
switch S1 sharing by a buck-boost typed PFC and an LLC 
resonant converter, the current stress of S1 is higher than that 
of S2.
Figure 10 shows the measured waveforms of the resonant 
inductor current iLr and resonant capacitor voltage vCr,
respectively. It is obvious that there are two resonant 
frequencies within one switching period. This converter 
operates in region 2 which results in high conversion 
efficiency at full load condition. Figure 11 shows the 
measured waveforms of the output rectifier diodes D3 and D4.
It reveals that D3 and D4 operate under ZCS condition. The 
voltage spike caused by diode reverse recovery can be avoided.

I. INTRODUCTION
Electronic devices are generally driven by the dc voltage 
obtained from rectifying and smoothing the ac line voltage, 
which may induce current harmonic distortions and 
electromagnetic interference. In order to prevent the rectified 
current impacting power quality and increasing power 
dissipation of transmission line, there are many international 
standards, such as IEC61000-3-2 [1], to specify the criteria of 
current harmonics in the electronic applications. 
Passive filters are the simplest approach to suppress current 
harmonic distortions. But, bulky components and 
nonadjustable characteristics are their main disadvantages. 
Thus, inserting one active power factor corrector (PFC) [2] in 
the front end of dc-dc converters is the alternative and popular 
approach to reduce current harmonics and improve power 
factor. The system block diagram of this approach is shown in 
Fig. 1, which consists of two-stage converters. For a two-stage 
system, in spite of increasing size, cost and circuit complexity, 
power dissipation of additional energy processing results in 
lower system efficiency. To solve these problems, literatures 
[3-11] have proposed to operate the front end PFCs in 
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), and develop 
numerous single-stage converters by sharing power switches 
[12] with the back end converters. These single-stage 
converters have been successfully used in the applications of 
electronic ballast and dc power supply. 
In the researches of single-stage converters, if the back end 
converters belong hard switching operation, the integrated 
single-stage converter will be also operated in hard switching 
[5], [6]. In order to further improve system efficiency, various 
resonant converters [7-11], such as series resonant converter 
(SRC), parallel resonant converter (PRC), and series-parallel 
resonant converter (SPRC), are adopted as the back end 
converters to develop single-stage converters with soft 
switching operation. However, SRC, PRC and SPRC have the 
problems of output voltage regulation at light load and 
circulating energy. Therefore, the LLC resonant converter is 
proposed to overcome these problems [13-15]. Furthermore, 
literature [11] has integrated a boost type PFC and an LLC 
resonant dc-dc converter to develop a single-stage ac-dc 
converter with zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation. 
Fig. 1 Block diagram of a dc power system with an active PFC. 
When a boost converter is adopted as the PFC, the dc-bus 
voltage should be designed to be much higher than the 
magnitude of the ac input voltage to achieve a unity power 
factor. Therefore, the voltage rating of power components is 
increased, which results in higher cost and lower efficiency. 
To overcome this problem, literatures [5] and [8] propose to 
use buck-boost typed PFC, and successfully develop several 
single-stage high power factor electronic ballasts. Their dc-bus 
voltages are designed to be close to the magnitude of the ac 
input voltage. 
Considering above discussions, this paper proposes a novel 
single-stage LLC resonant ac-dc converter with power factor 
correction feature. The proposed converter is the integration of 
a buck-boost typed PFC and an LLC resonant dc-dc converter. 
The frequency modulation control is used for output voltage 
regulation, and the power factor correction can be naturally 
achieved by operating input inductor current in DCM. Due to 
saving a power switch and a controller, the circuit complexity 
can be simplified, and the system size and cost can be reduced. 
Furthermore, because of reducing one stage energy conversion 
and ZVS operation of power switches, the system efficiency 
can be significantly increased. Experimental results of a 100W 
prototype are used to verify the feasibility and validity of the 
theoretical predictions.

D. Mode 4 
This mode starts when iLr and iLm equal each other. Current 
circulating through the secondary diode D3 naturally decreases 
to zero so that this diode turns off under zero current switching 
(ZCS) condition. The voltage spike caused by diode reverse 
recovery would not exist. The voltage of Lm is no longer 
clamped to nVO, hence, Lm is in series with Lr and participates 
in the resonance with Cr in the resonant tank. The equivalent 
circuit of this mode is shown in Fig. 4(d). Because the 
equivalent inductance of (Lr + Lm) is much higher than Lr, as 
shown in Fig. 3, iLr and iLm are almost constant in this short 
time interval. 
E. Mode 5 
As shown in Fig. 4(e), while S1 is turning off, the resonant 
current iLr is charging COSS1 and discharging COSS2
simultaneously. At the moment of vds2 decreasing to zero, the 
resonant current iLr flows through anti-paralleled diode D2
which provide ZVS operation for S2 turn-on. At the same time, 
the secondary rectifier diode D4 turns on. The voltage of Lm is 
clamped to nVO with reverse polarity so that the current iLm
decreases linearly. The magnetizing inductor Lm is separated 
from the resonance with Cr. When S2 turns on under ZVS, this 
mode ends and enters the other half cycle with symmetrical 
operation principles. Besides, the voltage across the inductor 
Lpf is Vdc with reverse polarity so that the current iLpf becomes 
linear decreasing. The energy of Lpf is released to the capacitor 
Cdc through the diode Dpf.
F. Mode 6 ~ Mode 10 
The operation principles of modes 6 ~ 10 are almost 
similar to those of the first five modes. The main difference is 
the inductor current iLpf becomes linear decreasing instead of 
increasing. In order to achieve the power factor correction 
feature, iLpf must decrease to zero before S1 is turned on again. 
By the way, since the inductor current iLpf operates in DCM 
and the resonant current iLr flows through diode Df1 before S1
turning on, the turn-on loss of the switch S1 is negligible.

Fig. 4 Operation modes of the proposed single-stage LLC resonant ac-dc 
converter. 
III. ANALYSIS OF SINGLE-STAGE CONVERTER
A novel single-stage LLC resonant ac-dc converter 
proposed in this paper can fulfill power factor correction and 
output voltage regulation features simultaneously. Based on 
the operation principles presented previously, the functions of 
the original buck-boost converter and LLC resonant converter 
are remained, even they share the power switch S1. Therefore, 
the proposed single-stage converter is divided into a buck-
boost typed PFC and an LLC resonant dc-dc converter, and 
they can be analyzed separately. For simplifying the analysis, 
following conditions are made: 
1) All components are ideal. 
2) The dc-bus capacitor Cdc is large enough so that the 
voltage Vdc across it can be regarded as a constant voltage 
source. 
A. Buck-Boost Typed PFC 
As shown in Fig. 2, the buck-boost typed PFC is mainly 
formed with the upper switch S1 in the LLC resonant converter, 
the additional input inductor Lpf and diode Dpf. Without any 
additional current-shaped controller and by designing the 
inductor current iLpf operated in DCM, the input current can be 
shaped naturally to follow the input sinusoidal voltage to 
achieve high power factor. 
The input sinusoidal voltage can be expressed as

Fig. 7 Frequency response of voltage gain for the LLC resonant converter. 
According to ωH  and ωL, and slopes of curves, Fig. 7 can 
be divided into three operation regions. In region 3, because 
switching frequency is lower than resonant frequency, the 
impedance of resonant tank is capacitive, and the primary 
switches operate under ZCS condition. However, during turn 
on transient, the current spike will result in high current stress, 
high switching loss and noise. Therefore, this converter should 
be prevented from operating in this region [13-15]. 
In region 1, the switching frequency is higher than the main 
resonant frequency ωH. The impedance of resonant tank is 
inductive, and the switches can operate under ZVS condition 
to reduce switching loss. Since voltage gain (|MV|) is less than 
1, the converter could be regarded as buck type. The operation 
principle in this region is very similar to SRC; hence, 
secondary rectifier diodes cannot operate under ZCS. Voltage 
spike will occur during turn-off transient and result in lower 
efficiency. 
When the switching frequency is lower than the main 
resonant frequency ωH, the converter is operated in region 2 
and regarded as boost type (voltage gain Њ 1). Because the 
inductance of Lm is only slightly higher than Lr, and its voltage 
is clamped by output voltage, the inductor current iLm is 
increasing linearly during the main resonant period. While iLm
reaches the same level as the resonant current iLr, a second 
resonance with the frequency ωL determined by Cr and (Lr + 
Lm) will occur. This resonance will continue until the primary 
switches switching again so that the converter can still operate 
under ZVS in region 2. Besides, during the second resonant 
period, the current of secondary rectifier diodes remains zero; 
hence, they can turn off naturally under ZCS condition [13-15].  
Generally, the primary switches of LLC resonant converter 
can operate under ZVS condition both in region 1 and region 2. 
But the secondary rectifier diodes can only operate under ZCS 
condition in region 2. Therefore, the theoretically optimal 
converter efficiency should be obtained in the point of 
switching frequency equal to the second resonant frequency 
ωL. For practical considerations, in order to minimize power 
dissipation and prevent the operation point from entering 
region 3, the switching frequency of full load operation should 
be designed as slightly higher than resonant frequency ωL.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Based on previous analysis, a 100W prototype of the 
proposed single-stage LLC resonant ac-dc converter is 
implemented to verify the feasibility and validity of the 
theoretical predictions. The electrical specifications and 
component parameters are summarized in Table I.

Figure 8 shows the measured waveforms of the input line 
voltage and input current, respectively. It can be seen that the 
input current is sinusoidal and in phase with the input line 
voltage. The measured power factor is 0.98, and the measured 
efficiency is 86%. The proposed single-stage converter can 
significantly improve power factor and suppress current 
harmonic distortions. 
Figure 9 shows the measured waveforms of the primary 
switches S1 and S2 at full load condition. It could be observed 
that S1 and S2 can turn on under ZVS condition. Because of 
magnetic inductor Lm participating resonance, the switch 
current can be reduced at the turn-off transient. Therefore, the 
circulating energy and turn-off loss can be significantly 
minimized to improve system efficiency. Besides, due to the 
switch S1 sharing by a buck-boost typed PFC and an LLC 
resonant converter, the current stress of S1 is higher than that 
of S2.
Figure 10 shows the measured waveforms of the resonant 
inductor current iLr and resonant capacitor voltage vCr,
respectively. It is obvious that there are two resonant 
frequencies within one switching period. This converter 
operates in region 2 which results in high conversion 
efficiency at full load condition. Figure 11 shows the 
measured waveforms of the output rectifier diodes D3 and D4.
It reveals that D3 and D4 operate under ZCS condition. The 
voltage spike caused by diode reverse recovery can be avoided.
