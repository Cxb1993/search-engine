一、前言 
隨著無線通訊網路技術的進步，加上電子元件價格漸漸下降以及行車安全問題越來越
受重視，各國政府紛紛投入智慧型運輸系統(Intelligent Transport Systems, ITS)的研究[1-7]。
ITS 為應用先進的電子、通信、資訊與感測等技術，以整合人、路、車的管理策略，其主
要的目地為提供即時(real-time)的資訊，並增進運輸系統的安全、效率及舒適性，同時也減
少交通對環境的衝擊。 
車用隨意網路(Vehicle Ad-hoc Network, VANET)，為當前了為實現 ITS 所發展出重要網
路架構[8]。在個架構下，每一個搭載無線通訊設備的車輛，都可以透過路旁的路側系統(Road 
Side Unit, RSU) 連線到 Server 端索取所需的資訊。而當車輛距離基地台太遠超出傳訊範圍
時，也可透過其它的車輛幫忙轉送。換句話說，每一個車輛都可視為是一部行動無線路由
器(Mobile Wireless Router)。因此，這樣的架構可大幅提升網路建置彈性，只要有車輛的地
方，即可是 VANET 的涵蓋範圍。 
車用隨意網路的應用主要可以分為兩類: (1) 安全性質服務(safety services) (2) 非安全
性質服(non-safety services)。前者是在限定區域內提供一對多的緊急訊息廣播(one-to-all 
emergency message broadcasting)服務，例如電子煞車系統(electronic brake light)、車道切換
輔助(lane changing assist)、路況報導(road condition reports)等，這類應用通常是與生命安全
息息相關的(life critical)，因此訊息不只是要能成功的被接收還要在極短的時間內到達，以
讓駕駛者有更多時間來對緊急事故作出反應。後者則是提供一對一資料路由(one-to-one data 
routing)或一對多資料廣播(one-to-all data broadcasting)服務，例如娛樂相關、路徑規劃等，
這類應用著重於高穩定高頻寬的傳輸需求。除此之外，達到安全與非安全性質服的同時，
車用網路本身的通訊安全性也是個重要的議題，如何安全、有效率、隱私地傳送資料，將
影響車用網路於各種應用的可行性。 
在安全性質服務部分，根據統計，每年超過數千萬的交通事故是因為車輛撞擊所引起
的[9]。而導致車輛撞擊的因素因有許多，諸如車輛機械問題、天候狀況、行車時段等。其
中，駕駛者的行為(driver behavior) 是最重要的因素。在行車過程當中，駕駛者若無法對緊
急發生的事故(如: 落石、緊急煞車、車輛打滑) 即時作出煞車反應，則經常會造成一連串
的車輛撞擊 (chain car collision)，也就是俗稱的連環車禍。VANET 網路的建構可大幅改善
這樣的問題。當緊急事故發生時，前方車輛可將些事故的訊息，直接透過無線媒介的傳遞
給後方的車輛，以避免中間車因為視線上阻隔的所帶來的延遲。此訊息可再藉由車輛上無
線裝置的轉送，快速的傳遞給更後面的車輛，因此可以免除掉駕使者本身所需反應時間。
這樣的系統稱作聯合碰撞避免(Cooperative Collision Avoidance, 簡稱 CCA) [10-14]。然而，
當過多的訊息於無線媒介中傳送時，則會有嚴重干擾的關題(interference)，進而導致較大的
傳輸延遲 (delivery delay)，這將直接威脅到駕駛人的安全。 
更進一步來看，當車輛偵測到前方的碰撞事故，必需立即廣播出一個訊息來告知周邊
的車輛，在這同時其中一台接收訊息的車輛會被選作轉送者(forwarder)來進行訊息的轉送。
相同的，此轉送者會將訊息廣播出去並選擇下一個轉送者，這樣的動作會一直重覆直到此
訊息已傳達到風險區的邊緣。由於訊息都只透過傳送者來廣播，如果沒有適當的選者轉送
者，將會造成過多的車輛參與轉送，使得資料通道的競爭(channel contention)和資料封包碰

二、研究目的 
本計畫主要的目標為提供車用隨意網路之存取控制與連結機制。達成這個目標，我們
將針對車用隨意網路於安全性質服務、非安全性服務、以及通訊安全三個部分進行研究，
各部分的研究目的詳述如下： 
(1) 安全性質服務部分 
z 車用隨意網路安全訊息廣播機制 
安全訊息的傳送必需以廣播導向(broadcast oriented)的方式來設計。然而透過無線媒介
進行廣播，經常會造成嚴重的干擾，甚至導致廣播風暴的現像(broadcast storming)，所以在
設計上必需利用額外的資訊來降低這樣的問題。常用的方法是透過車輛上的衛星定位裝置
(global positioning system, GPS)所取得的地理資訊來限制轉送的區域。如文獻[27][29]，在每
一個安全訊息中夾帶傳送車輛的位置資訊，收端可依據和送端的距離決定傳送的優先順
序，以避免同時轉送所帶來的干擾。而文獻[28][29]則是用送端相對收端的方向，來決定是
否要進行傳送。文獻[30]更進一步利用地理資訊，估算出可能的威脅程度，使處在較高危險
區域的車輛優先轉送。雖然現有的方法已利用地理資訊來減少過多轉送帶來的干擾，但是
由於傳送功率是固定的，因此每一次傳送所造成的干擾範圍仍是無法降低。有鑑於此，在
提出的方法中，我們利用功率控制的方式來真正降低干擾範圍。在此同時，我們利用地理
資訊所估算的安全距離限止最低的功率，以確保所有潛在受到威脅的車輛都能收到安全訊
息。此外，考慮到 VANET 網路高度的變動性與有限的頻寬，我們所提備的機制完全不需
要任何拓撲的資訊與週期性資料的交換。 
z 車輛密度為基礎的緊急訊息廣播機制 
緊急訊息的廣播，可分為發送端導向(sender-oriented)與接收端導向(receiver-oriented)兩
種架構。在發送端導向中[31-36]，傳送端利用正確的鄰居位置來選擇下一個轉送者。由於
周邊節點的位置資訊是可取得的，每一個傳送端節點可直接選擇距離自己最遠的鄰居來減
少轉送的點。另一方面，由於下一個轉送點已明確地被發送端指定，其它不是轉送點的節
點不會參與競爭，因此訊息可在收到後直接地被送出，不需額外的等待時間。但這個架構
必需仰賴高頻率且周期的控制訊息來即時地更新位置資訊，才能正確的選擇最遠的轉送
點，因此有較高的控制負載(control overhead)，若是資料無法即時更新，更可能會選擇到一
個已經脫離涵蓋範圍的車輛作為轉送點，而造成轉送失敗。而在接收端向導向的架構中
[37-40]，轉送點是不會事先由發送端決定好，而是交由接收端自行去競爭傳送權，以選出
下一個轉送點。然而，在稀疏的網路(sparse network)中，倒退時間可能會有過長的情況，而
增加延遲時間。此外，在密集的網路(dense network)中，也可能會有數個節點計算出相近倒
退時間的情況，造成較嚴重的干擾問題。為了解決上述問題，我們提出了一個以車輛密度
為基礎的緊急訊息廣播機制。這個架構主要的概念是透過預估周邊車輛的密度，來減少參
與競爭轉送者的數量，並同時降低轉送時所需的等待時間。這個架構也只需要有較少的控
制負載，就能達成穩定的運作。 
(2) 非安全性質服部分

z 車用隨意網路安全訊息整合認證機制 
在安全訊息驗證方面，Raya 與 Hubaux [48]針對車用隨意網路的安全問題，於 2005 年
提出系統性解決方法。隨後，許多用以增進安全、效率，與功能性之相關研究因應而生
[49-60]。在 2008 年，Zhu [60]等人針對行車突發緊急事件的驗證程序，提出一個聚集訊息
驗證機制。此機制植基於憑證公開金鑰密碼系統(certificate public key cryptography)，故此機
制之聚集驗證包括憑證驗證與簽章驗證兩部份。為了有效地簡化傳統公開金鑰密碼系統所
需之憑證管理，Shamir [61]於 1984 年提出以身份為基礎之公開金鑰密碼系統(ID-based 
public key cryptography，簡稱 ID-PKC)。此密碼系統中，使用者的公鑰是由使用者的身份識
別碼(identity)推導產生。此系統存在一公正第三者(trusted third party，簡稱 TTP)，亦即私鑰
產生者(private key generator，簡稱 PKG)，用以協助使用者產生其私鑰。故 ID-PKC 可能會
衍生金鑰托管(key escrow)的問題。Al-Riyami 與 Paterson [62]為解決 ID-PKC 的金鑰托管問
題，提出免憑證公開金鑰密碼系統(certificateless public key cryptography，簡稱 CL-PKC)的
概念，在 CL-PKC 中，存在一公正第三者，亦即金鑰產生中心(key generation center，簡稱
KGC)，協助使用者產生部份使用者私鑰。使用者隨後自行產生一秘密資訊，再與部份使用
者私鑰結合，產生完整者的使用者私鑰。因此，KGC 無法得知使用者的完整私鑰，即能有
效解決 ID-PKC 之金鑰托管問題，亦同時能降低憑證的使用率。為改善上述問題，我們提
出一個安全的聚集訊息驗證機制(secure aggregated message authentication scheme，簡稱
SAMA)。此機制是基於免憑證公開金鑰密碼系統(certificateless public key cryptography，簡
稱 CL-PKC)，用以驗證車用隨意網路之突發緊急事件。經由效能的評估，此機制可有效地
降低聚集訊息驗證所需之計算量。此外，我們利用 Petri nets 分析提出之機制，並驗證此一
方法可有效地抵禦偽造攻擊(forgery attacks)，同時提供車輛之隱私保護(privacy protection)。 
 7
如圖二所示，我們估算車輛 i-1 與車輛 i 之間的安全距離，並依此距離推算不同情況下
的滑行距離 Mi。接著，根據此滑行距離 Mi，以及後方車輛的煞車力道 Di+1，行車速度 Vi+1，
和所需求的息訊傳遞時間，估算出在車輛移動下的所需保持的安全距離 Si,i+1。最後，根據
此安全距離 Si,i+1，以及收到訊息前的車距變動，算出對車輛 i+1 所需要的最小傳輸半徑 Ti,i+1。 
此外，考慮到 VANET 網路高度的變動性與有限的頻寬，我們所提出的機制完全不需
要任何拓撲的資訊與週期性資料的交換  
2. 車用隨意網路安全通訊金鑰協議協定 
我們提出了一個混雜式對應基礎金鑰協議協定(Chaotic Maps-based Key Agreement 
Protocol)。這個協定不需任何檢查表就可在伺服器與使用者之間達到人工認證以及區段金
鑰協議(session key agreement)的能力。不同於過去的金協議協定，伺服器不再需要任何的驗
證表，而會先產生系統參數，包含Chebyshev polynomialsE(・)、D(・)、以及H(・)。假設一個
新的使用者Ui 想要和伺服器建立通訊的區段金鑰。Ui會隨機選擇它的密碼PWi，並且透過
一個安全的通道私下傳送 (IDi,H(PWi))到伺服器，當收到這個訊息後，伺服器將IDi和H(PWi)
由左到右並列到後面的訊息，並使單向雜湊函數H(・)計算H(IDi,H(PWi))。之後，伺服器可
計算出Regi = H(IDi,H(PWi)) ♁ H(Ks)，其中Ks是伺服器的私密金鑰，並透過一個安全的通
道傳送Regi 回Ui。 
 
圖三: 所提出金鑰協議協定的Petri網路模型 
我們使用如圖三的Petri nets來模組化及分析提出的協定，以驗證攻擊者是否能得到內
容。結果如表一所示，我們的方法可有效抵抗重覆攻擊、偽造攻擊、以及竊取驗證攻擊，
並且擁有相互驗證、使用者匿名、以及known-key安全性等優點。

2. WAVE/DRSC MLFF 高速公路電子收費系統 
美國FCC在5.8GHz的頻帶上分配了75MHZ的頻寬作法WAVE的通訊。IEEE 802.11p則將
此頻寬切分為七個相等頻寬通道(10MHz)，包含一個控制通道(control channel, CCH)和六個
服務通道(service channels, SCHs)。CCH 區間時段下的SCHs是閒置的，這是因為現在的車
用無線通訊裝置，基於成本的考量，大部分只使用單一的天線(single-radio)，因此無法同時
利用CCH和SCHs的頻寬。然而相對於一般車輛，ETC收費站屬於大型公有建設，較無成本
的限制。 
因此我們所提出的ETC架構，主要是利用具有多重天線(multi-radio)的RSU作為收費站
的通訊裝置，以利用CCH 區間時段下的SCHs頻寬作為ETC交易使用，這樣的好處是可以
不被現有的其它WAVE服務所影響。Multi-radio RSU擁有與頻通同等數量的天線，因此可以
同時監控所有的通道，並協調不同通道之間的交易，一般的車輛則仍可用單一的天線來降
低成本。 
如圖六，本架構將multi-radio RSU的傳送範圍切分為登入區(Reservation region)和交易
區 (transaction region) 內外兩個層次，車輛進入 reservation region 時，以競爭基礎
(contention-based)的方式向RSU保留一個SCH，而在進入transaction region時，則可以輪詢基
礎(polling-based)的方式，在事先保留的SCH上跟RSU進行交易，以避免其它訊號的干擾，
保證車輛在經過ETC收費站時能順利的完成交易。 
 
圖六: Multi-radio RUS 的區域切分 
當車輛進入到交易區，則會停止一切在CCH區間時的傳送，直到收到RSU的輪詢要求，
才會與RSU在預約好的SCH上進行交易。一旦車輛完成交易或者駛離交易區，預約的SCH
會再度被釋放出來，以供後面的車輛使用。除此之外，由於車輛進入到交易區後，會在CCH
區間切換到不同的SCH，因此RSU必需負責收集這段時間在CCH上的訊息，並在CCH區間
結束前彙整給所有在交易區內的車輛。 
利用上述的流程，交易的負載可分散至不同的服務通道，避免單一控制通道的擁塞問
題。區分登入區與交易區的架構，更可確保車輛在通過入收費站時，不會被其它的傳輸所
干擾，以提升系統的可靠度。此外車輛在進行ETC交易的同時，仍可透過Multi-radio RSU
的協助，來保證其它安全訊息的接收。因此我們預計這個架構，將可高度整合於未來的車
用網路環境。 
 11
現在，我們描述其細部程序。類似於 AODV 協定，當一台車輛需要傳送封包時，它首
先廣播一個 RREQ 封包到鄰近的車輛。當一個鄰居接收到此 RREQ 封包，如果它沒有可以
到目的地車輛的繞徑路徑，它將重新廣播此路徑需求到其它鄰居。不同於 AODV，我們限
制 RREQ 的 TTL 值在三次跳躍內。當一台車輛 接收這個 RREQ，他首先檢查跳躍次數是
否仍然少於三次: 如果是，則這台車輛 將變成下一個轉送者來廣播此 RREQ 封包; 如果不
是，則此車輛將丟棄此 RREQ 封包。如果目的地車輛的資訊存於繞徑表格中或行動閘道器
車輛接收這個 RREQ 封包，它將傳送回一個 RREP 封包到來源車輛。更進一步，如果此車
輛等待了一段時間而且沒有收到此 RREP 封包，它將重新廣播一個 RREQ 封包，並重覆上
述程序。 
 
圖八: 來源與目地車輛傳送通封包情境 
在 MGRP 中，每一個車輛可行動閘道器遞送資料封包以減少傳送跳躍的次數，同時達
到更可靠的通訊品質 quality。圖八顯示一台來源車輛 Source 如何(於圖左側)傳送封包到一
台目的地車輛 Destination (於圖右側)。當來源車輛有封包要送給目的地車輛，它首先搜尋
一台鄰近於自己的行動閘道器車輛，也就是 Gateway 1，以及傳送封包到此閘道器車輛。然
後，Gateway 1 使用 3G 介面卡轉送此資料封包到一個基地台。當收到此封包，基地台遞
送這個封包到一個後端的閘道器控制器，以搜尋目的地車輛所在的位置，以及傳送此封包
到一組鄰近於目的地車輛的行動閘道器車輛，也就是 Gateway 4。最後，Gateway 4 將透過
IEEE 802.11 介面卡轉送封包到目的地車輛。若沒有 Gateway 1、Gateway 4、以及閘道器控
制器的輔助，來源車輛將必需攜帶此封包直到遇到 Vehicle 1、Vehicle 3、或 Vehicle 9。相
同的問題也會發生在下一台車輛攜帶這此封包的車輛上。在成功抵達目的地車輛前，上述
的遞送程序可能導至較長的延遲時間。更糟的是，如果封包被轉送到 Vehicle 9，而沒有其
它車輛與 Vehicle 9 連結的車輛可以傳送目的地，這個封包將會遺失，而導致不可靠的傳送。 
當來源車輛廣播了 RREQ 封包去要求一個繞徑路徑後，會有三種可能的狀況發生。 
z 狀況一: 除了來源車輛，其它車輛無法利即找到一台鄰近的車輛。在這個狀況下，此
車輛將攜帶封包直到另一台出現在自己的傳送範圍為此。之後，它 將轉送此封包到那
台車輛。 
z 狀況二: 存在一台以上的鄰近車輛，但它們之中不存在一台可以在三次跳躍內到達目
的地路徑的行動閘道器。在這個狀況下，來源車輛將根據各道路的車密度資訊(Road 
density)，為此封包決定一個轉送的方向。當此車輛位處於交叉路口時，它將選擇車密
度較高的方的道路方向。如圖八顯示，那裡不存在任何繞徑路徑可從 Source 2 將資料

接下來，我們使用 ns2 simulator (version 2.34) 評估 MGRP 的效能表現。我們比較 MGRP
以及傳統位置-基礎的繞徑協定 GPSR。並分析閘道器 車輛所佔的比率以及成功地遞送率之
間的關係。 
 
圖十一: 模擬街道圖 
我們由 TIGER 資料庫(Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding 以及 Reference 
System)。所取得的真實街道地圖進行模擬。測試 MGRP 在高速公路(highway)以及市區(urban)
兩種情境。如圖五所示，市區街道是配置在一個 1100m*1100m 區域，包含 61 條道路以及
150 輛車。我們以 10 CBR 流量以及 512-byte 的封包大小作測試。表二詳列其它的模擬參數。

圖十四顯示繞徑成本(不包含 Hello 訊息)以及封包遞送率與跳躍次數之間的關係。我們
測試了 45km/h、65km/h、以及 85km/h 的平均車速。結果顯示當跳躍次數增加時，封包遞
送率以及成本增加，這是因為當跳躍次數增加時，我們的協定有更高的成功地率能轉送封
包到閘道器車輛，但同時也增加了封包成本。 
 
圖十四: 封包遞送率、路由成本、與跳躍次數 
在第三年的計畫中，我們針對車用隨意網路，提出了一個以位置為基礎的繞徑協定，
稱作行動閘道器繞徑協定(MGRP)。我們利用了部分的車輛作為行動閘道器車輛，所裝備的
車上單元可透過 3G 或 IEEE 802.11 介面卡轉送資料封包。其它沒有 3G 介面卡的車輛可透
過無線網路轉送封包到行動閘道器車輛，再使用 3G 介面卡轉送封包到閘道器控制器。最
後，閘道器控制器將過鄰近目的地車輛的行動閘道器車輛轉送封包。我們設計的繞徑協定
適用於這樣的混合式網路架構，並明顯地減少跳躍次數和連斷線的機率。模擬結果 MGRP
確實表現的比傳統位置-基礎繞的徑協定 GPSR 要更好。

在 IEEE 802.11p 使用 5.9 GHz 頻段的專用短距通訊技術 DSRC。本機制存在一 KGC，用以
建置系統初始參數的設定與協助車輛產生部份私鑰。

簽章產生階段(Signature Generation) 
當一個緊急事件Ei被車輛Vj偵測到時，且內容是(Typei; Loci; Timeij)，Vj產生一個的SER如下: 
1. Vj計算一對如下的(Wi; Sj)，其中Wi是事件狀態的雜湊值，Sj是事件狀態結果車輛Vj’s 的
虛擬碼及公開金鑰: 
 
2. 當有了私鑰(xj ;Dj), Vj產生如下的簽章(Wi; Sj) 
 
因此，(Typei; Loci; PIDj ; Timeij ; Sigij ; PKj) 組成一個SER宣告。之後，Vj廣播SERij到他的鄰
居。給定SERij = (Typei; Loci; PIDj ; Timeij ; Sigij ; PKj), 一個單一的SER驗證可以被如下的驗
證者(verifier)執行: 
1. 驗證者首先計算一組(Qj ;Wi; Sj)如下: 
 
2. 之後，驗證者依下檢查簽章的有效性: 
 
如果這個式子成立，簽章就能被接受。 
聚集授權階段(Aggregated Authentication) 
聚集授權包含聚集簽章(signature aggregation)批次驗證(batch verification)，詳細的步驟如下: 
聚集簽章: 對一個特定的緊急事件Ei，任何車輛如以當作一個聚集簽章產生者，稱作
aggregator，這個aggregator可以聚集一組擁有相同事件宣告(Typei ;Loci)的獨立簽章。如圖十

However, the r-neighborhood graph was primarily de-
signed for stationary nodes. When applied to mobile
environments, more attention should be paid to nodes’
mobility. Besides, for theoretical interest, the power con-
sumption model was simplified in our previous works. The
simplification may overlook some facts in reality. For these
reasons, our goal is to extend the concept of the r-neighbor-
hood graph to a more realistic network. To achieve this
purpose, we make the following contributions in this paper.
1. Generalized power consumption model. In [4] and [5],
we assumed the power consumed at the receiver is
negligible. Besides, the path loss is specific to free
space environments, where no obstacle or reflection
exists. In this paper, we generalize the r-neighbor-
hood graph to a more realistic power consumption
model proposed by Rodoplu and Meng [7]. Both the
receiving cost and the general path loss exponent are
considered in this model.
2. Extended parameter set. Although the energy con-
sumption can be adjusted through the parameter r,
the desired value of r would be varied for different
nodes. For example, a node with less energy would
prefer a larger r to reduce its own transmission
radius or node degree, while a smaller r would be
preferred, if the node has surplus energy to perform
relaying for other communication pairs. In other
words, an identical r cannot provide the most
appropriate settings for all nodes. Therefore, we
extend the r-neighborhood graph so that each node
u has the flexibility to configure its own ru.
3. Energy-efficient maintenance protocol. To maintain the
topology for mobile nodes, each node has to
periodically broadcast a beacon to denote its new
position. It may consume considerable energy, if the
broadcasting power is large. We design an energy-
efficient maintenance protocol, named the Adaptive
Neighborhood Graph-based Topology Control (ANGTC).
The ANGTC can drastically shrink the broadcasting
power for each periodic beacon. Moreover, we prove
that any reconstruction can be done in 4, where 
is the beacon interval.
4. Adaptive configuration rule. In [6], we turned the value
of r to find the minimal energy consumption using
simulation. But there was no discussion about how
to adjust r in a decentralized matter. Moreover, the
settings of different ru’s could be more complicated.
Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive config-
uration rule inside the ANGTC to configure the
parameter ru for each node u. The rule aims at
achieving balanced energy consumption between
nodes and routes, and improving the stability of the
topology.
For a detailed introduction to the r-neighborhood graph
and its challenges in mobile environments, readers can
refer to Appendices A.1, A.2, and A.3, which can be
found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://
doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.68.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
specifies the network model and measurements. Section 3
defines the graphic structures and analyzes their proper-
ties. The protocol and configuration rule are investigated
in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 presents a
series of simulation results. Concluding remarks are given
in the last section. The proof of any property shown in
this paper can be found in Appendix F, which can be
found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://
doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.68.
2 NETWORK MODEL AND MEASUREMENTS
Given a deployment region @, a set V of n nodes is
distributed on @. Each node u 2 V can obtain its location
LocðuÞ on @ using a lower power GPS. Besides, the power
consumption follows the path loss model [2]. More specifi-
cally, let pmaxðuÞ denote the maximum transmission power
of a node u. Node u can transmit to another node v only if
tdðu; vÞ  pmaxðuÞ, where dðu; vÞ is the euclidean distance
between u and v,  is an exponent depending on the
environment [2], and t is the predetection threshold (in
mW) at the receiver side, t > 0. The network can be
represented as a digraph GmaxðV Þ, where a directed edge
uv 2 GmaxðV Þ if and only if tdðu; vÞ  pmaxðuÞ. In addition,
node v needs additional c power to receive from u.
Therefore, the least power required for a transmission from
u to v in this model is cþ tdðu; vÞ [7].
Generally speaking, the topology control is to determine
a subgraph of GmaxðV Þ. Consider a controlled topology
GðV Þ. The transmission radius and degree of a node u in GðV Þ
are defined, respectively, as
TuðGðV ÞÞ ¼ maxuv2GðV Þdðu; vÞ; ð1Þ
DuðGðV ÞÞ ¼ jfv 2 V juv 2 GðV Þgj: ð2Þ
Let ðu; vÞ ¼ v0v1    vh1vh denote a path connecting two
nodes u and v, where v0 ¼ u and vh ¼ v. The total
transmission power required to relay on ðu; vÞ is

In worse-case situations, the energy efficiency of nodes is
measured by the maximum node degree, DmaxðGðV ÞÞ, and the
energy efficiency of routes being preserved is measured by
the power stretch factor [3]

Fig. 1. The r-neighborhood region of u and v.
Finally, the property below shows that our structure is
symmetric and connected (the proof is in Appendix F.3,
which can be found on the Computer Society Digital
Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/
TPDS.2011.68). A topology is symmetric if the presence of
an edge implies that its inverse exists, which is important,
since the designs of many network primitives, such as
collision avoidance, would become very complicated if
links are asymmetric. Moreover, connectivity is unques-
tionably the prerequisite in any network.
Property 3. Given a set V of n nodes on @, for any

2. NGfrðV Þ is connected.
The relationship between NGrðV Þ and NGfrðV Þ is as
follows (see Appendix F.4, which can be found on the
Computer Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecompu
tersociety.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.68, for the proof).
Property 4. Given a set V of n nodes on @, for any 0  r  1, if
c ¼ 0,  ¼ 2, and ru ¼ r for any u 2 V ,
NGfrðV Þ  NGrðV Þ:
We can see that the two structures are equivalent when
 ¼ 2 and c ¼ 0. In other words, NGfrðV Þ is a general
structure of NGrðV Þ in terms of  and c.
3.2 Equalization
Now, we present an equivalent structure of the general fr-
neighborhood graph, called the general fr-enclosed graph.
The basic idea is borrowed from the enclosed graph,
proposed by Rodoplu and Meng [7].
First, we define a duality1 of the general r-neighborhood
region.
Definition 3. Given two nodes u and w on @, 0  r  1,   2,
the general r-relaying region of u and w is defined by
RRrðu;wÞ ¼

A region, enclosed by the complements of the general r-
relaying regions, is given as follows.
Definition 4. Given a set V of nodes on @, the general r-enclosed
region of a node u is defined by
ERrðuÞ ¼
\
uw2GmaxðV Þ
f@ \RmaxðuÞ RRrðu;wÞg:
Based on the region, the graph is defined below.
Definition 5. Given a set V of n nodes on @, a set fr : frv1 ;
rv2 ; . . . ; rvng, 0  rvi  1, the general fr-enclosed graph of V ,
denoted as EGfrðV Þ, has an edge uv if and only if uv 2
GmaxðV Þ and LocðvÞ 2 ERruvðuÞ, where ruv ¼ maxfru; rvg.
Fig. 4 shows the fr-enclosed region of a node u (white
area), which is enclosed by the four r-relaying regions (dark
areas) of u with surrounding nodes v, v0, v00, and w (the
darker areas are overlapped by two or more regions). We
can see that a node has a link from u if and only if it is
located in the fr-enclosed region of u. To see how ru
changes the shapes of our defined regions, readers can refer
to Appendix B.2, which can be found on the Computer
Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.
org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.68, for further illustration.
Now we show that the two structures are equivalent (See
Appendix F.5, which can be found on the Computer Society
Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/
10.1109/TPDS.2011.68, for the proof).
Property 5. Given a set V of n nodes on @, for any

4 ENERGY-EFFICIENT MAINTENANCE
Based on the equivalence in Property 5, in this section, we
design an energy-efficient maintenance protocol for the
general fr-enclosed graph.
4.1 The ANGTC Protocol
The main idea of this protocol is to utilize the information
partially received from nearby nodes to confine the broad-
casting radiuses of subsequent beacons.
In every time interval of , each node broadcasts a
beacon at a certain radius to nearby nodes. Consider a node
u. Let Su denote the set of nodes detected by u during the
previous  time. Similar to Definition 4, we define
ERrðujSuÞ as the general r-enclosed region of u based on
nodes in Su, i.e.,
ERrðujSuÞ ¼

Wehave also conducted a numeric study for our protocol.
The results show that the ANGTC can significantly reduce
the average transmission radius by 5 to 60 percent. The
power shrinking mechanism can further shrink the radius
up to 10 percent. The detailed results can be found in
Appendix D.2, which can be found on the Computer Society
Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/
10.1109/TPDS.2011.68.
5 ADAPTIVE CONFIGURATION RULE
In this section, we propose an adaptive configuration rule
for the ANGTC protocol. We first analyze how an
individual ru affects the overall energy efficiency from the
following three points.
1. Energy efficiency of nodes versus Energy efficiency of
routes. Nomatter what the values of other parameters
in fr are, Property 1 has shown that a smaller ru can
always lead to an overall improvement in the energy
efficiency of routes, and a node u can conserve its own
energy by simply turning up its ru.
2. High mobility versus Low mobility. If a node moves
frequently, its links are unstable, which in turn
costs more energy for route reconstruction, and
deteriorates the quality of the established routes. In
this case, the node should keep a lower degree to
reduce its dependency on nearby nodes by turning
up its ru. On the contrary, if a node has lower
mobility, it should turn down its ru to construct
more reliable routes.
3. Topology maintenance power. In the ANGTC protocol,
the broadcasting radiusMu is not fixed. As shown in
Property 8 (proven in Appendix F.8, which can be
found on the Computer Society Digital Library at
http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/
TPDS.2011.68), it could be varied by the configura-
tion of ru.
Property 8. In the ANGTC protocol, for each node u, the
broadcasting radius Mu is decreased by ru.
Concluding the above observations, we have two
principles for adjusting ru:
1. If a node u has sufficient energy or rarely moves, it
should connect with more neighbors to improve the
energy efficiency as well as the stability of routes. In
this case, a smaller ru is preferred.
2. If anodehas insufficient energyormoves frequently, a
smaller ru that leads to a lower node degree,
transmission radius, and beacon power is desired.
Accordingly, the adaptive configuration rule is charac-
terized as follows:
ru ¼ 1 Energyu
EnergyFull
 
we;u þ Mobilityu
MobilityMax
 
ws;u; ð10Þ
where Energyu and Mobilityu stand for the residual energy
and current mobility of node u, and EnergyFull and
MobilityMax represent the full energy level and the
maximum mobility level, respectively. In addition, we
adjust the impact from residual energy and mobility level
by two weights we;u ¼ 1 ðEnergyu=EnergyFullÞ and ws;u ¼
1 we;u. At the initial stage, since nodes have little deviation
in their residual energy (assuming the initial energy is
equal), the mobility dominates the value of ru. As time goes
by, the impact from node’s energy will become more and
more significant.
6 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we compare the ANGTC with existing
topology control protocols for mobile nodes using the ns2
simulator [8]. For each test case, we simulated 50 networks,
each with 100 nodes uniformly placed on a 1,000 meters
square region. Each node has a maximum transmission
radius of 500meters and is initiated by 0.5 Joules. The 802.11b
MAC is used for link-layer contention. Wemodify the DSDV
routing protocol [9] such that packets are conveyed on the
least-energy path. The connections of CBR traffic are
established for 20 distinct source-destination pairs, and the
packet size is 256 bytes. The energy cost consists of all
network operations during the simulation. The mobility
pattern is based on the random-way point model. We test
three speed intervals of [0, 5], [0, 15], and [0, 30] m/s, to
imitate low-speed, middle-speed, and high-speed circumstances,
respectively. In addition, the pause time of each node is
randomly taken from [0, 5] s. Each run lasts 200 s.
For comparison, we also implemented the following
protocols in the ns2: the SMECM [10] is considered
appropriate for conserving route energy. It preserves the
least-energy path (i.e.,  ¼ 1) for any node pair. On the
other hand, the XTC [11] is considered appropriate for
conserving nodes’ energy. It confines node degrees to
within 6, with connectivity guaranteed. The K-NEIGH [12]
is considered resilient to node mobility. It only requires
nodes to identify their K-closest neighbors instead of their
precise positions. A pruning stage is proposed in [12] to
revoke redundant links. We denote this version as K-
NEIGH*. Here, we take K ¼ 9, which is the least value for
the topology to be connected with a probability of 0.95 [12].
For more details, readers can refer to Appendix E, which
can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at

measures the average energy efficiency of the routes. We
can see that the SMECN always preserves the optimal
routes, but it compensates for a larger transmission radius.
On the other hand, the power ratio of the XTC is about
six percent larger than the optimal, but it has a much
smaller transmission radius. The radius of K-NEIGH can be
reduced significantly in the pruning stage, but it is still
slightly above than that of the XTC. However, these

configuration rule is given to configure the parameter for
each node based on the node’s mobility and energy levels.
Experimental results show that our protocol has signifi-
cantly reduced the overall energy consumption and net-
work lifetime. For future research, a node may lose
important information to construct the graph if a collision
occurs. It is, thus, worthwhile to design a collision
avoidance mechanism for the ANGTC protocol.

devices) cannot perform on two different channels at a time, the design of many essential mechanisms, such as contention
resolution, hidden terminal avoidance, and broadcasting support, could be much more difﬁcult in comparison with a single-
channel MAC (e.g. IEEE 802.11 DCF).
To overcome the above limitation, a prominent approach, called the dedicated control channel (DCC), was proposed [3–10].
In this approach, each node is equipped with a control interface and a data interface. The control interface is permanently ﬁxed
on a common channel (called control channel) for sensing or exchanging control signals. On the other hand, the data interface
can switch among the remaining channels (called data channels) for data transmission. As shown in Fig. 1, if node u intends to
transmit to node v, it ﬁrst initiates a control process with v on the control channel to coordinate a data channel. Then, nodes u
and v can communicate on that channel. Since the control channel is shared by all nodes, other competitors in the interfer-
ence range of u or v can be aware of the coordination. Besides, a link-layer broadcast can be easily achieved by emitting on
the control channel. Most importantly, since each node has an interface dedicated to listen to the control channel, nodes can
exchange control signals without any time synchronization mechanism.
However, designing a DCC-based MMAC protocol confronts two major challenges:
(1) Control channel bottleneck problem: As described above, using a common control channel can greatly simplify the
design of a MMAC. Nonetheless, if too many nodes contend on it, the control channel would become a bottleneck
of the overall performance. As shown in Fig. 2(a), three sender–receiver pairs {u, v}, {x, y}, and {w, z} are coordinating
on the control channel ch0. Besides, there are three data channels with bandwidth B. Ideally, the throughput can
achieve 3B if each pair transmits on a different data channel. However, since the time required for a control process
is about a half of a data transmission in this example, at most two data channels can be utilized at the same time,
resulting in a lower throughput of 2B. In other words, the throughput is saturated by the control channel’s bandwidth.
The bottleneck problem will become more serious as the number of data channels, data rates, or node’s density
increases [3].
(2) Data channel selection problem: The DCC approach allows each sender–receiver pair to select a data channel in an on-
demand matter. But, if the selection strategy were not carefully designed in concern with the reusability of channels,
the throughput would be lower. As shown in Fig. 2, assume that the sets of channels which are free to nodes y, x, u, and
v are as speciﬁed in Fig. 2(b). Clearly, the transmissions from y to x and from u to v can be active simultaneously on
different channels. But, if nodes u and v do not consider channel statuses at nearby nodes, they may select ch2 in prior
to nodes y and x, further degrading the throughput from 2B to B.
In this paper, we propose a new MMAC protocol to resolve the two challenges in the DCC approach, composing of the
following three components:(1) Control initiation-time prediction (CIP) reduces the control overhead by properly predicting
the initiation time of each control process to avoid unsuccessful channel coordination; (2) Dynamic data-ﬂow control
(DDC) dynamically adjusts the amount of ﬂow in each data transmission to balance the congestion in the control and data

nication channel between two nodes is still ﬁxed, which is not ﬂexible when the channel of the intended receiver is highly
interfered. Second, a link-layer broadcast is hard to be implemented. A node should broadcast the same message on all chan-
nels to ensure the delivery.
The split control phase approach divides each beacon interval into a control phase and a data phase [14,15]. As shown in Fig. 4,
all nodes periodically rendezvous to a common channel in the control phase to sense carriers and coordinate channels for the
subsequent transmissions in the data phase. In this approach, nodes have the most ﬂexibility to use diverse channels during
the data phase. Besides, the exchange of control packets and link-layer broadcast can be easily achieved during the control
phase. Nonetheless, the phase alignment relies on strict time synchronization so that it is hard to implement in practice.
The dedicated control channel approach does not require any time synchronization mechanism. With the control interface,
each node can access the control channel at anytime. However, as mentioned in Section 1, the throughput could be limited
by the bandwidth of control channel and inﬂuenced by the selection of data channels. Besides, the dynamic channel selection
means that more control overheads are required for the channel coordination. Hence, in this paper we focus on solving these
challenges.
Finally, in the common rendezvous approach [16], nodes not exchanging data hop through all channels synchronously. A
pair of nodes stops hopping as soon as they make an agreement for transmission and rejoin the common hopping pattern
subsequently after transmission ends. In comparison with the DCC, this approach can make use of all the channels for data
exchange and requires only one interface per node. However, it does not resolve the control bottleneck problem since only
one pair of nodes can make an agreement at the same time. The parallel rendezvous approach [17,18] overcomes this problem
by assigning different hopping sequences to nodes. In SSCH [17], each node picks multiple sequences and follows them in a
time-multiplexed manner. When node Awants to talk to node B, Awaits until it is on the same channel as B. The McMAC [18]
improves SSCH by allowing a sender to temporally hop to the sequence of the receiver to avoid waiting. The major problem
in these rendezvous approaches is that they may incur large switching delay for channel hopping, and each node requires
synchronization mechanisms to track the hopping sequence of the others. Besides, a link-layer broadcast is hard to be imple-
mented in a hopping fashion.
2.2. Existing protocols for DCC approach
The concept of using separated channels or special devices (e.g. busy tones) to improve medium access control has been
extensively studied in works such as [19–22], but these researches consider only one data channel, i.e. designed for single-
channel MAC. The ﬁrst MMAC protocol under the DCC approach was presented in [3] and named the dynamic channel assign-
ment (DCA). In this protocol, each node maintains a free channel list (FCL) to record unused data channels. As a node u intends
to transmit to a node v, it ﬁrst sends a RTS to v carrying its FCL. Then, node v compares the received FCL with its own FCL to
select a common free channel. If there is any, the selected channel will be replied to u using a CTS. Once received the CTS,
node u emits a reserve-to-send (RES) to inhibit other nodes from using the same channel. Meanwhile, nodes u and v can start
to exchange the DATA and ACK frames on the selected channel. Integration with the power control technique was proposed
in [4].
Compared with the IEEE 802.11 DCF, the DCA needs an additional control frame (e.g. RES) to reserve the channel selected
at the receiver’s side. To avoid such overhead, the protocol in [5] suggests that each sender can ﬁrstly propose a free channel
in the RTS. If the channel is free to the receiver, the data transmission can be started immediately upon received the CTS.
Otherwise, it follows the same way in [3]. A similar protocol appears in [6], where the proposed channel in the RTS will
be replied by a reply-to-RTS (RRTS) that indicates whether the channel is free or not. The negotiation will continue until
a common free channel is found. Nonetheless, these protocols may spend more control bandwidth if the proposed channel
is not accepted by the receiver.
Another way to relieve the bottleneck problem is by using multiple control channels. Koubaa [7] showed that the number
of control channels required to achieve the maximal throughput is a function of the available channels and packet size. For
instance, with 12 channels and packet size of 1024 bytes, providing three control channels is optimal. Likewise, the protocol
in [8] employs an extra channel for replaying ACKs to improve the channel reusability. By replying the ACK in a separated
channel, a sender can be active simultaneously with its hidden terminals. Although using multiple control channels is ben-
eﬁcial, coordinating on different channels could be more complicated.
The channel selection strategy in the DCA [3] is simply to ﬁnd a communicable channel. Each sender–receiver pair coor-
dinates a channel that is free at the two sides. If there are multiple choices, one channel will be chose at random. The strategy
was slightly improved in [9,10]. In [9], the channel with the least received power will be chosen to avoid potential interfer-
ence. Similarly, in [10], the most robust channel will be selected according to the carrier-to-interference ratio. In other
words, [9,10] are concerned about not only the communicability, but also the quality of the selected channel.

time indicates when node u can successfully initiate a control process with v. As shown in Fig. 5, ctrl_ini_time(u, v) = t2. The
prediction process will continue before the control process is actually started.
At ctrl_ini_time(u, v), node u starts the following control process. It ﬁrst applies the DDC to determine the number of data
frames to be sent for v, denoted as Ku,v. According to the Ku,v, the network allocation vector required to exchange the DATA
and ACK messages can be set as
NAVDATA ¼
XKu;v
i¼1
ðTDATAi þ SIFSÞ þ TACK þ 2s;
where TDATAi is the time to transmit the ith data packet in the queue for v. As shown in Fig. 5, Ku,v = 3 and NAVDATA = t10t6. So,
node u will transmit the ﬁrst three packets to v during t6 to t10. Next, node u applies the ECS to evaluate the cost for trans-
mitting on each data channel h. The cost, denoted as Du(h), is the total increment to the starting times of possible transmis-
sions at u’s nearby nodes as if node u transmitted on channel h for a period of NAVDATA. Then, following the IEEE 802.11
backoff mechanism, if there was no carrier on the control channel in a DIFS plus the BF, node u sends a RTS to v, containing
the NAVDATA and the Du(h), for any h = 1, 2, . . . , H.
Once received the RTS, node v also applies the ECS to evaluate the cost Dv(h), for each data channel h, i.e. the total incre-
ment to the starting times of possible transmissions at v’s nearby nodes as if node v transmitted on channel h for a period of
NAVDATA  s. Combining the costs evaluated from the two sides, the total cost for communicating between u and v on a chan-
nel h, denoted as Du,v(h), is the sum of the Du(h) and Dv(h). The data channel that will be released to u and v and has the least
Du,v(h) will be selected. If such a channel can be found, denoted as h⁄, node v has to update the following statues for the forth-
coming data transmission on h⁄ such that
if rel timeðvÞ ¼ ch rel timeðv;hÞ ¼ Tcurr þ 2SIFSþ TCTS þ NAVDATA:
For example, at Tcurr = t4, node v sets if_rel_time(v) = t9, and ch_rel_time(v, h⁄) = ch_rel_time(v, 2) = t9. Besides, node v sets two
timers as follows in its CTS.

of channels and interfaces at sender and receiver. To explain the idea, let us see the example in Fig. 6(a).1 In the beginning,
node u has some packets for v at t0. At the moment, the release times of ch1, ch2, and ch3 at u and v are (t3, t1, t10) and (t14, t8, t17),
respectively. We know that two nodes can communicate with each other only if at least one data channel has been released to
both of them. Therefore, node u cannot send any data frame to v before t8 = min{max{t3, t14}, max{t1, t8}, max{t10, t17}}, i.e., the
release time of ch2. Moreover, no data frame can be transmitted until the data interfaces of both u and v have been released.

receptively. Assuming that the time required for a control process is equal to the time required for sending one data packet,
we show how DDC adjusts Ku,v. In the beginning, Ku,v = 1. Thus, node u sends one data packet to v. Then, node u intends to
send the next packet to v. However, at this moment, the control processes for other two ﬂows have started, so node u cannot
initiate a control process immediately with v. Consequently, u’s data interface experiences a period of idle status before the
next data transmission starts. In order to mitigate such inﬂuence from control channel, the DDC expends Ku,v in proportion to
the idle time experienced from u’s data interface (i.e. Ku,v = 1 + 2 = 3) to increase the utilization of data channels for the sub-
sequent data transmission to v. As shown in this example, by the end of the second data transmission, the next data trans-
mission can be started immediately without any idling. Nonetheless, during the third data transmission, since the data ﬂow
between w and z has ﬁnished, the control channel becomes less congested at v, resulting in a period of idle status in u’s con-
trol interface before the next control process starts. In order to reﬂect such fact, the DCC shrinks Ku,v in proportion to the idle
time experimented from u’s control interface (i.e. Ku,v = 3  1 = 2). Finally, Ku,v converges to 2 and the congestion in control
and data channels are balanced. The process will continue if any further change occurred.
In summary, Ku,v is adjusted according to two idle timers: the data interface idle time, denoted as dif_idle_time(u, v), and
the control interface idle time, denoted as cif_idle_time(u, v). Therefore, below we give a more realistic example to show how
an idle status occurs in the RTBM. Then, the two idle timers and adjusting rule are formally deﬁned. Lastly, we provide an
online algorithm for efﬁcient maintenance.
In Fig. 8(a), node u has some packets for v at t0. At the moment, node u ﬁnds that the link release time link_rel_ti-
me(u, v) = t4 and control initial time ctrl_rel_time(u, v) = t4  pre_ctrl = t2. Ideally, if there is no contention before t2, the data
transmission can start at t5 = t2 + pre_ctrl + BF (recall that BF is not in the pre_ctrl). However, at t1 an irrelevant RTS is de-
tected, so node u has to update ctrl_ini_time(u, v) = max{t4  pre_ctrl, t1 + NAVCTRL} = max{t2, t3} = t3. Consequently, the data
transmission should be deferred from t5 to t7 = t3 + pre_ctrl + BF. The deferral will result in a period of idle status from t5
to t7 on u’s data interface. Therefore, we can estimate that dif_dile_time(u, v) = t7  t5 at this time point.
Then, the control process starts at t3 (see Fig. 7(b)). During the BF, another RTS is detected, so node u has to suspend the
current process and update the new control initiation time to t8. Consequently, the data transmission should be further de-
ferred from t7 to t11 = t8 + pre_ctrl + BF, resulting in a longer period of idle status on u’s data interface from [t5, t7] to [t5, t11].
However, during the sub period [t6, t9], node u cannot transmit any data to node v even if the control channel is not con-
gested, since all data channels (ch1 and ch3 of node u and ch2 of node v) are blocked by some NAVs in this time interval. Thus,
the dif_idle_time(u, v) should be set as dif_idle_time(u, v) = (t11  t5)  (t9  t6) to reﬂect the deferral purely incurred by the
control channel congestion. We call the time interval [t6, t9] the non-idle time.
After a DIFS and BF, node u sends a RTS and waits for the CTS from v (see Fig. 8(c)). However, before the RTS arrived, the
control channel of v has been blocked by another RTS so that u cannot obtain any reply from v before the end of the time out
period at t10. As a result, the starting time of the data transmission is further deferred from t11 to t12. That is, the dif_idle_-
time(u, v) should be updated as (t12  t5)  (t9  t6). This example shows that the idle status of u’s data interface could be
incurred by the control congestion at both node u and node v.
Continuing the example, in Fig. 8(d), the data transmission starts at t12 and ends at t17 = t12 + NAVDATA. During this period,
the control interface of u is released after sending the RES and reserved for the next control process after t16 = t17  pre_ctrl.
In addition, the control channel is contended during the sub-period from t14 to t15. Therefore, the control interface idle time
is the sum of the two periods from t13 to t14 and from t15 to t16, i.e. cif_idle_time(u, v) = (t16  t15) + (t14  t13).
Now, we formally deﬁne the two idle timers based on the above observations. Let data_tx_time⁄(u, v) and data_tx_ti-
me(u, v) stand for the earliest and the actual starting times of a data transmission from u to v, respectively. At any time t,
the data interface of u is idle if and only if
(i) data_tx_time⁄(u, v) 6 t < data_tx_time(u, v);
(ii) link_rel_time(u, v) < t.
For a transmission from u to v, dif_idle_time(u, v) is the total time satisfying (i) and (ii). In Fig. 8, data_tx_time⁄(u, v) = t5, and

idle time. Similarly, at any time t, the control interface of u is idle if and only if
(i) data_tx_time(u, v) + TRES + s < t < data_tx_time(u, v) + NAVDATA  pre_ctrl;
(ii) ch_rel_time(u, 0)  Ttype < t, where type is the type of the received control frame.
For a transmission from u to v, the cif_idle_time(u, v) is the total time satisfying (iii) and (iv).

4.3. Enhanced channel selection strategy
The ECS aims at improving the reusability of data channels. The main idea is based on exploiting the release times of chan-
nels and interfaces at neighboring nodes to select a free data channel that will cause the least inﬂuence to nearby
transmissions.
A.A.-K. Jeng et al. / Computer Networks 55 (2011) 2176–2195 2187
not only free to the sender and receiver themselves, but also adds the least total delay to the starting times of possible trans-
missions at nearby nodes.
Now, we formally describe the ECS below. Consider a sender u and a receiver v. As the control process is initiated at ctrl_i-
ni_time(u, v), node u ﬁrstly identiﬁes a list of data channels that will be released to itself at the expected starting time of the
transmission to v as follows.
FCLðuÞ ¼ fhH j ch rel timeðu;hÞ 6 ctrl ini timeðu; vÞ þ pre ctrlþ BFg:
Note that by deﬁnition of the CIP, FCL(u) must be non-empty at ctrl_ini_time(u, v). In addition, let Nu denote the set of nodes
in u’s interference range. For eachw e Nu  {v}, node u calculates the time that at least one data channel will be released to w
as
CRuðwÞ ¼ minfCRTuðw;hÞj hHg:
The CRu(w) is called the critical channel release time of w, and the ﬁrst data channel released to w is called the critical channel
of w. Combining with the interface release time of w in IRVu, we deﬁne
NRuðwÞ ¼ maxfCRuðwÞ; IRVuðwÞg:
It is called the node release time of w. Clearly, node w cannot start any transmission before NRu(w).
Next, node u evaluates the cost for transmitting on each h e FCL(u). For each w e Nu  {v} and h e FCL(u), if nodes decided
to transmit on channel h for a period of NAVDATA, the CRu(w) could be enlarged (at least equally), and the new critical release
time of w can be formulated as
CRþu ðwjhÞ ¼ min
max
CRTuðw; hÞ;

 
;
min CRTuðw; h0Þjh0H fhg
 
8><
>:
9>=
>;:
The above equation indicates that the original CRu(w) could be replaced by the release time of another channel h0 eH  {h},
if the release time of the original critical channel of w is enlarged so that it is no longer critical to w. As shown in Fig. 9, at t1,
CRu(c) = t2, but CR
þ
u (c|1) = t8 The gap between t2 and t8 is due to the fact that the critical channel of c will be altered from ch1
to ch2 if u transmits on ch1. Similarly, the corresponding node release time of w can be wrote as
NRþu ðwjhÞ ¼ maxfCRþu ðwjhÞ; IRVuðwÞg:
Using these terms, the increment to the node release time of w resulted from transmitting on channel h can be charac-
terized as
Duðw;hÞ ¼ maxfNRþu ðwjhÞ; Tcurr þ rresg maxfNRuðwÞ; Tcurr þ rresg;
where rres = pre_ctrl + BF + TRTS + s, denoting the duration before other nodes can receive the RES from u. Notice that the
Du(w, h) neglects the increment before ctrl_ini_time(u, v) + rres, since the transmission is not inﬂuential to w before the
RES is received by w. As shown in Fig. 9, although NRu(c) = CRu(c) = t2 and NR
þ
u (c|1) = CR
þ
u (c|1) = t8, since the RES will arrive
at t5, theDu(c, 1) is (t8  t5) instead of (t8  t2). Accordingly, if node u transmits on channel h, the total increment to the nodes
release time of all neighboring nodes can be deﬁned by
DuðhÞ ¼
X
wNufvg
Duðw;hÞ:
The Du(h) will be sent to v along with a RTS frame for any h e FCL(u).
When node v received the RTS, it performs the same evaluation for each h e FCL(v) \ FCL(u) and w e Nv  {u}  Nu, where

2 bytes to encode the communication Du(h) for each data channel h. Thus the size of RTS under H = 11 is 44 bytes (i.e.
44 = 20 + 2 + 2  11). Moreover, the CTS and RES needs 2 bytes for each duration of if_duration(v) and ch_duration(u, h),
and 1 byte for the selected channel h⁄ (see Section 3.2). Thus, the sizes of the later two frames under H = 11 are 39 bytes
(i.e. 39 = 14 + 2 + 2  11 + 1). Other system values speciﬁed for the DSSS PHY are also listed in Table 4. Although the RTBM
needs larger frame sizes, as shown later, the beneﬁt from our components can wholly compensate for such a drawback.
The above contexts are the default settings. We also vary some parameters one at a time to assess the performance under
different scenarios. Any result point of the following ﬁgures is averaged from 20 networks.
Fig. 10 reports the throughput versa the number of data channels (H). In comparison with the single-channel 802.11 DCF,
the DCA can use multiple data channels to increase the throughput. When H = 2, it achieves a 28.98% gain in single-hop case
and a 44.72% gain in multi-hop case. However, the improvement becomes very limited as more channels are provided. With
11 channels, the DCA obtains merely a 40.08% and 79.59% gain in the two cases, respectively. The results indicate that only a
small portion of data channels were utilized due to the bottleneck in control channel.
The bottleneck problem can bemitigated by CIP. As shown in Fig. 10, the RTBM(CIP) has 4–42% throughput increments over
the DCA. The reason is that CIP can prevent nodes from sending redundant RTSs and thus avoid unnecessary blocking from
NAVCTRL. Notice that CIP is particularly useful for smallH, because a coordination processmay fail when two nodes have no free
data channels in common, and there are relatively fewer common channels when H is small. Nonetheless, CIP cannot entirely
break throughthe limitationof thecontrol channel, sincea coordinationprocess is still requiredbefore sendingeachdatapacket.
The DDC can substantially resolve this problem. As shown in Fig. 10, RTBM(CIP+DDC) has improved the baseline through-
put by over 2.26 times in single-hop case and 3.49 times in multi-hop case, with just one additional data channel, i.e. H = 2.
Moreover, for H = 4, it can further gain 2.86 times and 5.17 times performance in the two cases. However, since the trafﬁc
load is not quite heavy in default, the throughput reaches the limit when HP 6. As shown in Fig. 11, by pressuring nodes

that the control overhead of McMAC goes up in accompany with more data throughput, because McMAC can spread control
loading over different channels. By contrast, the throughput of DCA is saturated by a small number of ﬂows, since the control
overhead is congested in a single channel. Compared with DCA, although RTBM needs larger control frames sizes, it incurs

1. Introduction 
With the popularity of wireless networks, the need for network bandwidth is growing rapidly. In 
order to provide high quality service, various categories of broadband wireless network techniques, 
e.g., IEEE 802.16e (or WiMAX, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) and 3GPP LTE, 
have been proposed. Among these techniques, IEEE 802.16e is an emerging network technique and 
has been deployed in many metropolises (e.g., Chicago, Las Vegas, Seattle, Taipei and so forth 
[1][2]). It provides mobile users with a high data rate (up to 75 Mbps) and a large coverage range (up 
to a radius of 10 miles) [3][4][5]. In addition, it also enables new classes of real-time video services, 
such as IPTV services, video streaming services, and live TV telecasts, which require a large 
transmission bandwidth, and need identical content to be delivered to several mobile stations. The 
most efficient way to provide such services is to use wireless multicasting, sending one copy of the 
video stream to multiple subscriber stations via a shared multicast channel, instead of sending 
multiple copies via several dedicated channels [6]. In this way, wireless multicasting can reduce 
bandwidth consumption significantly.  
IEEE 802.16e supports a variety of modulation and coding schemes (MCSs), such as QPSK, 
16QAM, and 64QAM, and allows these schemes to change on a burst-by-burst basis per link, 
depending on channel conditions [3][4][5]. Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is a term used in 
wireless communications to denote the matching of the modulation and coding to the channel 
condition for each subscriber station. It is widely applied to wireless networks. For example, the 
IEEE 802.16e base station (BS) can assign an appropriate MCS to each mobile subscriber station 
(MSS) based on its channel quality. This can be done by having the MSS advises its downlink 
channel quality indicator to the BS. The BS scheduler can take into account the channel quality of 
the MSSs and assign an appropriate MCS for each of them so that the throughput is maximized.   
Due to the mobility (i.e. the ability to move within the coverage area) of an MSS, the 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the BS may become degraded (i.e. the MSS could be in poor 
channel condition at some time). The adaptation strategy for the MSS with the worst channel 
condition will cause the data rate to be low, especially when the multicast group size is large [7]. For 
example, as shown in Figure 1, the BS chooses QPSK, the most conservative and robust MCS, to

(c) One base layer and two 
enhancement layers 
 
Figure 2: The video quality for the MSS under various numbers of video layers  
(The video, foreman, is downloaded from the video trace library [11]). 
 
In wireless networks, because the air resources are limited and shared by all receivers, 
organizing the layering structure of a video stream and assigning the appropriate MCS for each video 
layer to maximize the total utility is a crucial task[12]-[22]. Formally, the problem can be stated as 
follows: consider a video multicasting network having a scalable video stream V consisting of m 
video layers L = {l1, l2, …, lm} and adaptive modulation and coding scheme consisting of n MCSs 
{M1, M2, …, Mn}. The BS chooses a layering structure (i.e. selecting a set of video layers L from L), 
which will multicast to the MSSs, and determines an appropriate MCS for each video layer in L  
such that the total utility is maximized subject to a bandwidth constraint.  
In this paper, we formulate the MCS assignment of the layering structure as a total utility 
maximization problem (TUMP). This paper transforms the TUMP into a precedence constraint 
knapsack problem, which is an NP-complete problem [23]. The precedence-constraint knapsack 
problem is a generalization of the knapsack problem, which includes the constraint on the packed 
order of the items. For example, if item i precedes item j, then item j can only be packed into the 
knapsack if item i is already packed into the knapsack. Because the solution space of the problem 
TUMP consists of a large number of fruitless candidates, a branch and bound method which is based 
on two dominance rules and a lower bound is presented to solve the TUMP. The simulation results 
show that the proposed branch and bound method can find the optimal solution efficiently. Because 
the optimal solution can be found with just a little computation time, the proposed method is suitable 
 
 
Suppose that an MSS receives a set of video layers L  = {l1, l2, …, lk, lx, ly, …, lz} from a BS 
where k+1 < x < y < z. Note that an enhancement layer, say layer lk, can be used to refine the video 
quality only when the MSS has received all the lower layers, i.e., l1, l2, …, lk-1[14]. Therefore, in this 
example, the maximum number of consecutive video layers of L  is k. Then, we say that the 
received enhancement layers l2, l3, …, lk are the valid video layers for refining the video quality. The 
invalid video layer (e.g. lx, ly, or lz) will be discarded by the MSS.  
In order to determine the satisfaction degree of the video quality for an MSS, a relative measure 
of satisfaction, called utility, is used in [12]- [22]. Figure 3 is an example of the utility function for 
an MSS under various numbers of video layers [10]. When an additional video layer is received, the 
utility is increased and the MSS can experience the additional satisfaction. Because the attenuation 
is caused by shadowing or slow fading in the wireless communication, the utility function is often 
assumed to be log-normally distributed [24]. Let Util(i) be the utility of an MSS when it has 
received i valid video layers. Let δi be the additional utility when the MSS received the ith video 
layer, i = 1, 2, …, m. Then, δi can be calculated as follows:  
 ( ) ( 1)i Util i Util i    . (1) 
Note that Util(0) = 0. Thus, the additional utility of the base layer, δ1, equals Util(1). Table 1 lists the 
utility and additional utility of an MSS under various numbers of video layers (e.g., m = 5).

This is a 0-1 integer programming problem. xij is the decision variable where xij = 1 indicates 
that video layer li is encoded by Mj; otherwise, xij = 0. Constraint (4) ensures that the sum of the 
required time slots cannot exceed S. Constraint (5) limits a video layer to being encoded by only one 
MCS at the same time. In order to avoid sending the invalid video layer, constraint (6) ensures that 
the video layer li can only be encoded if the video layer li-1 has been encoded.   
 
3. The Solution Method 
In this section, we first transform the TUMP into a precedence constraint knapsack problem, 
which is a well-known NP-complete problem [23]. Then, we propose a branch and bound algorithm 
for solving the TUMP problem.  
 
3.1. Problem Hardness  
We convert the inequality constraint of the TUMP problem (equation (5)) to the equality 
constraint by introducing a set of slack variables Χ, where X = {x1n+1, x2n+1, …, xmn+1}. For all i, xi n+1 
is defined as

TUMP may consist of all 2mn combinations of the mn binary variables. However, we can apply the 
multiple choice constraints (5) and the precedence constraints (6) to reduce the solution space to 
 m nn   combinations. Figure 4 shows a possible tree organization for the case m = 4 and n = 3. We 
call such a tree a combinatorial tree. The links are labeled by possible choices of Mj for li (i.e., xij = 1). 
For example, links from the root (level-0) node to level-1 nodes specify that each of x1j, j = 1, 2, …, 
n, is selected and set to 1. The links from the level-i node, pointed to by the link with label xij=1, to 
level-(i+1) nodes are labeled by xi+1j = 1, xi+1j+1 = 1, …, or xi+1n = 1 due to the precedence constraints. 
For example, there are only two links from node 13 at level-2, pointed to by the link with label x22 = 
1, to the level-3 nodes 14 and 17. They are labeled x32 = 1 and x33 = 1, respectively. Thus, the solution 
space is defined by all paths from the root node to any node in the tree. The possible paths are () (this 
corresponds to the empty path from the root to itself); (x11 = 1); (x11 = 1, x21 = 1); (x11 = 1, x21 = 1, x31 
= 1); (x11 = 1, x21 = 1, x31 = 1, x41 = 1); (x11 = 1, x21 = 1, x31 = 1, x42 = 1); (x11 = 1, x21 = 1, x31 = 1, x43 = 
1); (x11 = 1, x21 = 1, x32 = 1); (x11 = 1, x21 = 1, x32 = 1, x42 = 1); etc. The path

utility first. That is, the node, say p, selected for next branching is the live node whose g(p) is the 
greatest among all the nodes in the live-node list. If node p is feasible, then the child nodes of p are 
added to the live-node list. For example, if node 3 is feasible and selected for branching, then three 
nodes, 4, 8, and 11 are generated and added to the live-node list (see Figure 4).  
Traversal of the combinatorial tree starts at the root node and stops when the live-node list is 
empty. In addition, a lower bound of total utility (LT) is associated with the branch and bound 
algorithm. LT = 0, initially, and is updated to be max (LT, f(u)) whenever a feasible node u is reached. 
If node p satisfies ( )g p LT  (i.e. the maximum total utility of node p is smaller than or equal to 
the lower bound total utility of the current optimal solution), then it is bounded since further 
branching from p does not lead to a better solution. If node p is infeasible, then it is bounded since 
further branching from p does not lead to a feasible solution. When any branch is terminated, the 
next live-node is chosen by the greatest utility policy. If the live-node list becomes empty, the 
optimal solution is defined by the path from the root to the node w with f(w) = LT. Optimal utility LT 
is the output of Algorithm 1.

 First, as shown in Figure 5, the algorithm checks if node 1 is a feasible node or not. Because h(1) 
= 0 which is smaller than 21, node 1 is a feasible node. The current total utility is f(1) = 0. Then, the 
algorithm adds nodes 2, 22, and 32 to the live-node list and computes g(2), g(22), and g(32). By 
equation (18), we obtain:  
g(2) = f(2) + w21 + w31 + w41 = w11 + w21 + w31 + w41 = 2.8 + 2.1 + 1.4 + 0.7 = 7, 
g(22) = f(22) + w22 + w32 + w42 = w12 + w22 + w32 + w42 = 1.2 + 0.9 + 0.6 + 0.3 = 3,  
g(32) = f(32) + w23 + w33+ w43 = w13 + w23 + w31 + w41 = 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.4 + 0.2 = 2.  
Since g(2) = 7 is the greatest value among nodes 2, 22, and 32, the algorithm chooses node 2 for 
branching.  
 
 
Figure 5: The algorithm chooses node 2 for branching.   
 
Next, the algorithm checks the feasibility of node 2 (see Figure 6). Because h(2) = t11 = 8 < 21, 
node 2 is a feasible node. The current total utility is f(2) = w11 = 2.8. Then, the algorithm adds nodes 
3, 13, and 19 to the live-node list. Because g(3) = f(3) + w31+ w41 = (w11 + w21) + w31 + w41 = (2.8 + 
2.1) + 1.4 + 0.7 = 7 is the greatest value among nodes 3, 13, and 19, it chooses node 3 for branching.

4.2. Experimental Results 
We have conducted simulations to demonstrate how effective the proposed mathematical model 
is. The simulation ran on a BS with 100 MSSs which were randomly placed within a cell. The 
coverage area of the BS was divided into six rings, P1, P2, …, and P6 as shown in Figure 8. Six types 
of MCS as in the IEEE 802.16e standard [3][4][5] were used (i.e., n = 6). The MSS in rings P1, 
P2, …, and P6 can be accommodated with MCS sets {M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6}, {M1, M2, M3, M4, 
M5}, …, and {M1}, respectively. The video stream was divided into one base layer and six 
enhancement layers (i.e., m = 7). The utility function was assumed to be log-normally distributed due 
to the attenuation caused by shadowing or slow fading in the wireless communication. The shape 
parameter and the scale parameter of the utility function were set to 1.5 and 0.5, respectively (see 
Figure 3) [10].

different available timeslots per second.  
 
Figure 10 shows one sample of the simulation results for the optimal algorithm and the uniform 
algorithm with the number of available timeslots S = 2500. As shown in Figure 10(a), for both 
algorithms, the MSS can receive more video layers when it is more closed to the BS. However, the 
numbers of video layers delivered by the optimal algorithm to the MSS in all rings except ring P6 are 
greater than or equal to the numbers of video layers delivered by the uniform algorithm. Similarly, 
from Figure 10(b), note that the utility values achieved by the optimal algorithm are greater than or 
equal to the values achieved by the uniform algorithm for all rings except ring P6. In this sample, the 
numbers of the MSSs for rings P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 were 3, 5, 42, 7, 10, and 33, respectively. 
The total utility achieved by the proposed algorithm was 40.92 (= (3+5+42) 0.71 + 7 0.47 + 
10 0.18 + 33 0.01), while it achieved by the uniform algorithm was 34.53 (= (3+5+42+7) 0.47 + 
(10+33) 0.18). The optimal algorithm shows its benefit. 
 
 
 
computational time significantly.  
From Table 3, the computational time to determine the optimal MCS assignment for the video 
layering structure is less than 75.604 μs. The computational time is small enough. Thus, the branch 
and bound method is effective and suitable for BS to determine the video layering structure and MCS 
assignment for IEEE 802.16e network multicast.

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we consider an optimal MCS assignment problem which improves spectral 
efficiency and maximizes total utility for the scalable video multicast in IEEE 802.16e networks. We 
propose a branch and bound algorithm to find an optimal solution for this problem. In the experiment, 
it was shown that the proposed method performs well compared to the uniform method and the naïve 
method. The computation time of the proposed branch and bound algorithm is very small. Thus, our

other key agreement protocols in Section 4. Finally, we will
conclude our paper in Section 5.
II. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we define Chebyshev chaotic maps and
introduce the hash functions based on chaotic maps.
A. Chebyshev Chaotic Maps
Chebyshev polynomial [9] and its properties [8, 11, 13] are
described as follows.
Definition 1. The Chebyshev polynomial Tn(x) is a polyno-
mial in x of degree n, defined by the following relation:
Tn(x) = cosnθ, where x = cos θ (−1 ≤ x ≤ 1) (1)
With Definition 1, the recurrence relation of Tn(x) is
defined as:
Tn(x) = 2xTn−1(x)− Tn−2(x), for any n ≥ 2, (2)
together with the initial conditions T0(x) = 1, T1(x) = x.
Some examples of Chebyshev polynomials are shown as
follows: (see Figure 1)
T2(x) = 2x2 − 1 (3)
T3(x) = 4x3 − 3x (4)
T4(x) = 8x4 − 8x2 + 1 (5)
Chebyshev polynomials have two important properties [8,
11, 13]: the semi-group property and the chaotic property.
• The semi-group property:
Tr(Ts(x)) = cos(r cos−1(cos(s cos−1(x))))
= cos(rs cos−1(x))
= Tsr(x)
= Ts(Tr(x)) (6)
• The chaotic property: If the degree n > 1, Chebyshev
polynomial map: Tn : [−1, 1]→ [−1, 1] of degree n is a
chaotic map with its invariant density f∗(x) = 1
π
√
1−x2
for Lyapunov exponent λ = lnn > 0.
B. Hash Functions based on Chaotic Maps
The hash function used in the previous key agreement
protocols [11, 13] is based on the following chaotic one-way
hash function [15]. A one-dimension piecewise linear chaotic
system is defined as:
X(t+ 1) = F (X(t), P ) (7)
where F (u, P ) =
⎧⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
u/P if 0 ≤ u < P,
(u− P )/(0.5− P ) if P ≤ u < 0.5,
(1− u− P )/(0.5− P ) if 0.5 ≤ u < 1− P,
(1− u)/P if 1− P ≤ u ≤ 1,
where X ∈ [0, 1] and P ∈ (0, 0.5). Xi is the chaining variable,
where 0 ≤ i ≤ 3N . X0 is an initial value of the chaining
variable and is chosen from (0, 1).
Given a pending message M , H0 is a constant which is
chosen from (0, 1). The 3-unit iterations—1st to N -th, (N +
1)-th to 2N -th, (2N +1)-th to 3N -th—ensure that each bit of
the final hash value will be related to all bits of the message.
The following is a brief referring to how to generate the hash
value:
• The pending message M is translated to the correspond-
ing ASCII numbers, then by means of linear transform,
these ASCII numbers are mapped into an array C whose
length N is the number of characters in the message and
whose elements are numbers in [0, 1].
• The iteration process is as follows:
1) 1st: P1 = (C1 + H0)/4 ∈ [0, 0.5),X1 =
F (X0, P1) ∈ [0, 1];
2) 2nd to N -th: Pi = (Ci + Xi−1)/4 ∈ [0, 0.5),Xi =
F (Xi−1, Pi) ∈ [0, 1];
3) (N + 1)-th: PN+1 = (CN + XN )/4 ∈
[0, 0.5),XN+1 = F (XN , PN+1) ∈ [0, 1];
4) (N +2)-th to 2N -th: Pi = (C2N−i+1+Xi−1)/4 ∈
[0, 0.5),Xi = F (Xi−1, Pi) ∈ [0, 1];
5) (2N + 1)-th: P2N+1 = (C1 + H0)/4 ∈
[0, 0.5),X2N+1 = F (X2N , P2N+1) ∈ [0, 1];
6) (2N + 2)-th to 3N -th: Pi = (Ci−2N + Xi−1)/4 ∈
[0, 0.5),Xi = F (Xi−1, Pi) ∈ [0, 1].
• Next, XN ,X2N ,X3N are transformed to the correspond-
ing binary format, and 40, 40, 48 bits after the decimal
point are extracted, respectively, and are juxtaposed from
left to right to form a 128-bit hash value.
For more details, the reader is referred to [15].
III. PROPOSED KEY AGREEMENT PROTOCOL
In this section, we propose a chaotic maps-based key
agreement protocol. The proposed protocol does not require a
verification table while achieving both mutual authentication
and session key agreement between a server and a user. We
list the notations used in this paper in Table I.
Different from the previous key agreement protocols [11,
13] where the server and user i share the hash value hPW =

Fig. 2. A Petri net model of the proposed key agreement protocol
TABLE II
FORMAL DEFINITION OF A PETRI NET
A Petri net is a 5-tuple, PN = (P, T, F,W,M0) where:
P = {P1, P2, · · · , Pm} is a finite set of places,
T = {T1, T2, · · · , Tn} is a finite set of transitions,
F ⊆ (P × T ) ∪ (T × P ) is a set of arcs (flow relation),
W : F → {1, 2, 3, · · · } is a weight function,
M0 : P → {0, 1, 2, 3, · · · } is the initial marking,
P ∩ T = Ø and P ∪ T = Ø.
A Petri net structure N = (P, T, F,W ) without any specific initial
marking is denoted by N .
A Petri net with the given initial marking is denoted by (N,M0).
is illustrated in Figure 2. The definitions of the places and
transitions used in this model are listed in Table III and
Table IV, respectively. The model is simulated with the HPSim
Petri net simulation tool [17].
2) Security Properties: The security of the proposed proto-
col is based on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem
(DLP) and the Diffie-Hellman problem (DHP), which are
believed to be unsolvable in polynomial time. We first specify
the mathematical difficult problems [13] used in this paper.
Definition 2. The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) is defined
as follows: given an element α, find the integer r such that
Tr(x) = α.
Definition 3. The Diffie-Hellman problem (DHP) is defined as
follows: given Tr(x) and Ts(x), find Trs(x).
Now we show that our protocol can resist replay attacks,
forgery attacks, and stolen-verifier attacks, and also analyze
the following security properties: mutual authentication, user
anonymity, and known-key security.
Theorem 1. The proposed protocol can resist a replay attack.
Proof. Assume an adversary A eavesdrops the messages
{sn,Ri, C1} and {sn,AUi} sent by Ui and replays them to
log in to the system in a later session. Upon receiving the
replay message, the server computes Ki = Ri ⊕ H(Ks),
and extracts IDi, ri, and Tr(x) from C1 with Ki. The
server first checks the validity of IDi, and then chooses two

This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communications Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 2009 proceedings
makes the problem even worse. In order to ensure all the
vehicles in the risk zone can receive the emergency message in
time, we consider two important ways to reduce the message
propagation latency. The key point is to reduce the hop counts
needed to propagate the message to the entire risk zone.
This can be done by choosing the forwarders such that the
hop distance is maximized. Moreover, the additional waiting
time before rebroadcasting the message should also be as
small as possible to ensure low latency. In this paper, a
vehicle-density-based emergency broadcast scheme called the
VDEB is proposed to reduce the message propagation latency
with little overhead. The rest of this paper is organized as
follows. In section 2, we will review the related works about
emergency message forwarding schemes. Then, our proposed
VDEB protocol will be introduced in section 3. Section 4 will
show the simulation results. The concluding remarks are given
in the last section.
II. RELATED WORKS FOR EMERGENCY MESSAGE
FORWARDING SCHEMES
Several research papers have proposed methods for emer-
gency message forwarding [3-12]. These methods can be cate-
gorized into two types: sender-oriented schemes and receiver-
oriented schemes. In the following, we will brieﬂy describe
the related works for each type of forwarding scheme, respec-
tively. The discussion related to the drawbacks of each is given
at the end of this section.
A. The sender-oriented schemes
Sender-oriented schemes [3-8] use accurate neighbor posi-
tions to select the best forwarder node (usually the farthest
node from the sender) claiming minimum hop count and no
additional waiting time. This approach uses high frequency
beacon messages or handshaking mechanisms to choose a
single node as the forwarder. Among the papers [3-8] con-
cerning the sender-oriented scheme, [3-5] are backbone-based
methods. They try to create and maintain stable clusters (or
virtual backbones) to reduce the overhead of the backbone
structure maintenance. The emergency messages are rebroad-
cast by the farthest vehicle of each cluster head. The papers [6-
8] are MCDS-like (minimum connected dominating set like)
methods. They use periodic beacon messages to acquire the
vehicle ID of the farthest vehicle in the transmission range
of a vehicle, and try to maintain an MCDS structure as the
backbone. The vehicle nodes located in the backbone will be
responsible for message broadcasting. Due to the requirement
of frequent beacon message exchanges, this type of method
encounters the problem of high overhead.
B. The receiver-oriented schemes
The receiver-oriented schemes [9-12] use contention to
automatically elect the forwarder(s) in a distributed fashion.
Contrasting with the sender-oriented schemes, the sender does
not assign the forwarder in the broadcast message. All the
one hop receivers concerning the emergency event enter the
contention phase after receiving the message in the receiver-
oriented schemes. They calculate a waiting time, and wait
this time period before rebroadcasting the message. The node
with the shortest waiting time may rebroadcast the message
ﬁrst. All the other nodes overhearing this broadcast will
cancel their broadcasting process. The parameters for waiting
time calculation can be the distance between the sender and
receiver, vehicle velocity, vehicle’s moving direction, number
of nodes, and so on.
Note that the vehicle with the larger waiting time will
not necessarily rebroadcast the message ﬁrst. Statistically, the
furthest node from the sender will have the highest chance
of rebroadcasting the emergency message ﬁrst. However, in
a sparse network, the waiting time still has a high chance
of being long. Moreover, several vehicles may have a similar
contention window size. As the vehicle density increases, the
situation of multiple rebroadcasting also could occur. This
might cause network congestion and collisions.
Both types of the existing message forwarding schemes have
their drawbacks. The sender-oriented schemes mainly rely on
accurate position data to select the forwarder. To maintain
accurate data, the broadcasting period of the beacon messages
should be very short, and the overhead will therefore become
large. In addition, inaccurate data may cause the sender to
select a forwarder outside the transmission range and thus the
forwarding process will fail. On the other hand, the latency of
the receiver-oriented schemes usually gets much longer in a
sparse network. The waiting time is usually reversely propor-
tional to the distance between the sender and the receiver. The
forwarders in a sparse network have a higher chance of being
far from the border of the sender’s transmission range because
the inter-vehicle spaces are larger than in a dense network.
III. THE VEHICLE-DENSITY-BASED EMERGENCY
BROADCASTING SCHEME (VDEB)
The considered scenario of our method is in a highway
environment. We assume all of the vehicles on the road are
equipped with a positioning device such as GPS to acquire
their own positions. In addition, to detect an emergency event,
the vehicles should also be equipped with several sensors
for vehicle velocity, etc. For the transmission of packets,
each vehicle is equipped with the WAVE DSRC device. The
VDEB is a receiver-oriented forwarding method; however, it
synthesizes the main ideas of the sender-oriented scheme and
tries to reduce the inﬂuence of the drawbacks of both methods.
The basic idea is that, in order to overcome the problem of a
long waiting time in a sparse network for the receiver-oriented
scheme, the VDEB adopts a ring-based approach to shorten
the waiting time. The aim of the ring-based approach is to
partition the transmission range of the current forwarder into
multiple concentric rings. The gap between two adjacent rings
is called the ring width. The computation of the ring width is
performed at the forwarder. As the ring width is determined, it
will be broadcast to notify the neighbors of the forwarder. The
receiver can then compute the waiting time according to the
704
Fig. 5. The possible cases of the maximum and minimum ring widths.
minimum ring width appears when the vehicle distribution is
as shown in Figure 5(b). The vehicles in the second and third
lanes partition the inter-vehicle distance of the ﬁrst lane into
three equal parts. The minimum ring width can be calculated
by:
MinRingWidth =
R
N
, (3)
The ring width can be randomly set to be the value in
[MinRingWidth,MaxRingWidth] and then the emergency
message can be broadcast to the neighbors of the current
forwarder.
C. The emergency message broadcasting scheme
The VDEB uses hello messages to periodically exchange
the basic information between any two vehicles. Based on the
information in the received hello message, each vehicle can
maintain its own neighbor table. For the current forwarder, the
vehicle density can be easily obtained from its neighbor table
and then the ring width can be determined. As the ring width
is estimated, it will be added to the emergency message and
then be broadcast to the one-hop neighbors. Upon receiving an
emergency message from a vehicle, it ﬁrstly calculates its ring
number by the ring width and the position of the forwarder
given in the message. The waiting time of ring 0 is 0 SIFS
time. The waiting time of the other rings is proportional to
their ring number as follows:
WaitingT ime = SlotT ime×RingNumber (4)
When a vehicle waiting in the waiting process overhears any
vehicle forwarding an emergency message, the waiting process
is canceled. As the next forwarder is elected, the message
relaying will be continued until the border of the risk zone is
reached. The complete operations of a forwarder and a receiver
of the VDEB are given in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
The purpose of our simulations was to compare the per-
formance of our proposed VDEB with the other conventional
emergency message forwarding schemes. The compared meth-
ods are the DBS and the MCDS schemes, which belong to

respectively. There are two parts to our simulations. Since
a better choice of a hello interval (HI) will greatly affect
the performance of sender-oriented schemes, thus at ﬁrst
we conducted simulations to show the tradeoff between the
efﬁciency and the overhead of the MCDS and the VDEB, and
then to determine the best value of the hello intervals for both
methods. The second part of the simulations was to conduct
performance comparisons between our proposed VDEB and
the DBS and MCDS schemes. The performance evaluations
were rely on NS2. In this section, the simulation environment
setup is ﬁrstly described. The numerical results are then given.
A. The simulation environment setup
The simulation scenario is an 8km, 3 lane, single direction
section of highway. The risk zone of an emergency event
is 1km. We vary the hello interval from 0.2s to 3.2s for
the MCDS scheme. The VDEB is also simulated with the
hello interval from 3.2s to 25.6s The mobility of vehicles is
evaluated by two speed scenarios: the low speed scenario has

A number of routing protocols that use fixed infrastructures 
to improve the packet delivery have been proposed. In 
MPARP [3], each vehicle is equipped with an IEEE 802.11 
and an IEEE 802.16 interfaces. When routes exist, vehicles 
can communicate directly with each other using the IEEE 
802.11 mode; otherwise, their communication will be taken 
over by a base station using the IEEE 802.16 mode. In RAR [4] 
and DDR [5], each section of the road is embraced by two 
RSUs. When a vehicle has some packets for another vehicle 
on a different section, it transmits to one of the RSU on which 
it is located. Then, the packets will be forwarded to the 
destination through the backbone network. Similarly, the 
routing protocol in [6] tries to make a proper decision on 
whether to broadcast or to use end-to-end transmission based 
on the information provided by RSUs.  
Although vehicular communication can be assisted by the 
support of V2I model, the advantage is restricted to those 
areas where fixed infrastructures exist. To overcome it, the 
MIBR protocol in [7] introduces the concept of mobile 
gateways. It employs each bus as a mobile gateway to forward 
packets for vehicles. Because buses have fixed travel routes 
and can be equipped with radios of larger transmission ranges 
(over 300m), it is beneficial to improve the delivery radio and 
throughput. However, the connectivity between buses is still 
limited to the period of bus schedules and the covered region 
of bus routes.  
To conquer the above limitations, this paper uses certain 
vehicles, e.g. taxi, in which 3G infrastructures are added to 
their OBUs, as mobile gateways. Other vehicles without the 
3G infrastructures can deliver packets to destinations through 
those gateway vehicles. Because the coverage of 3G 
infrastructure is large enough to cover the whole area, the 
proposed protocol can significantly reduce the hop count and 
improve the packet delivery ratio.  
III. MOBILE GATEWAY ROUTING PROTOCOL  
In this section, we first introduce the architecture and 
assumptions of the mobile gateway routing. Then, the MGRP 
routing protocol is presented in details.  
 
A. The Architecture of Mobile Gateway Routing 
As shown in Fig. 1, we utilize certain vehicles as mobile 
gateways to substitute traditional RSUs. The OBU on each 
gateway vehicle is equipped with an IEEE 802.11 interface and 
a 3G interface. The 3G interface is used to communicate with a 
base station in a cellular network and the 802.11 interface is 
used to communicate with other vehicles without the 3G 
interface. When the base station received data packets from a 
gateway vehicle, it will deliver the packets to a gateway 
controller. The gateway controller then searches the position of 
the destination, determines a set of gateway vehicles close by 
the destination, and sends packets to each of the chosen 
gateway vehicles via the based station. Finally, those gateway 
vehicles will transmit the data packets to the destination with 
IEEE 802.11 links.  
 
Figure 1: Architecture of mobile gateway routing. 
B. Assumptions 
We assume that each vehicle can obtain its position, 
velocity, and direction through a global positioning system 
(GPS) equipped on the vehicle. This information will be 
periodically broadcasted to nearby vehicles within the 
transmission range using a hello message. We also assume that 
a digital map with traffic load condition of roads is installed in 
each vehicle. Besides, if a vehicle founds that the route has 
been broken, it will buffer any received data packet and send a 
RRER packet to the source vehicle for selecting an alternative 
route. Different from ordinary routing protocols, such as 
AODV [8], the MGRP limits the time-to life (TTL) value to 
three hops.  
 
C. MGRP Routing Protocol 
In MGRP, each vehicle can deliver data packets via a 
mobile gateway to decrease the transmission hop count and to 
achieve more reliable communication quality. Fig. 2 shows 
how a source vehicle (left hand side) sends the packet to a 
destination vehicle (right hand side). When the source vehicle 
has some packets for the destination vehicle, it first searches a 
mobile gateway closest to itself, i.e. Gateway1, and sends 
packets to the gateway vehicle. Then, Gateway1 forwards the 
data packets to a base station using the 3G interface. Upon 
receiving the packets, the base station delivers the packets to 
the back-end gateway controller in order to search the position 
of the destination vehicle and transmits the packets to a set of 
gateway vehicles close by the destination vehicle, i.e. 
Gateway4. Finally, Gateway 4 will forward the packets to the 
destination vehicle via the 802.11 interface. Without the assist 
from Gateway1, Gateway4, and the gateway controller, the 
source vehicle has to carry the packets for a while until it meets 
vehicle1, vehicle 3, or vehicle9. The same problem happens on 
the next vehicle carrying those packets. The above relaying 
process may cause a longer delay time before reaching the 
destination vehicle. Even worse, if the packet is forwarded to 
vehicle9 and there is no further vehicle connecting vehicle9 to 
the destination, the packet will lose, causing an unreliable 
transmission. 
shown in Fig. 4, three gateway vehicles will receive the data 
packets from the base station. 
 
 
Figure 4: Gateway controller forwards packets to a set of 
gateway vehicles which are less than 500m to the destination 
 
IV. SIMULATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, we evaluate the performance of MGRP 
using ns2 simulator [9] (version 2.34). We compare MGRP 
with the traditional position-based routing protocol GPSR [10] 
routing protocol, and analyze the relationship between the 
percentage of gateway vehicles and the success delivery ratio.  
We perform the simulation on a real street map, captured 
from TIGER database (Topologically Integrated Geographic 
Encoding and Reference System) [11]. We simulated the 
MGRP within two scenarios, highway and urban. The urban 
street layout is within a 1100m*1100m area as shown in Fig. 5. 
There are totally sixty-one roads and 150 vehicles. We offer 
10 CBR flows and the packet size is 512-byte. The simulation 
parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Transmission range 250 m 
 
Figure 6: The percentage of gateway vehicles vs. packet 
delivery ratio 
 
We first evaluate the relationship between the percentage 
of gateway vehicles and the packet delivery ratio for a scenario 
of 4km highway with four lanes and double directions. The 
results are shown in Fig. 6. We can see that when more 
vehicles play the role as mobile gateways, the packet delivery 
ratio increases significantly. Even in low density scenario (20 
vehicles/km), the MGRP can achieve 80% packet delivery ratio 
if the percentage of the gateway vehicles is over 60%. When 
the percentage of gateway vehicles is 10%, the packet delivery 
ratio is down to 38%. Besides, the MGRP needs at least 70% 
gateway vehicles to reach the 100% delivery ratio in the low 
density scenario. On the other hand, the result shows that it can 
perform better in middle (30 vehicles/km) and high density 
scenarios (40 vehicles/km). In these cases, the MGRP needs 
just 30% of gateway vehicles to achieve nearly 100% delivery 
ratio. That is, if there are ten vehicles in the highway scenario, 
using our protocol just needs three vehicles to equip the OBU 
devices. Therefore, it does not need too much cost in this 
network architecture. 
Now, we compare the performance of MGRP and GPSR. 
Fig. 7 shows the packet delivery ratio versa the maximum 
speed.  We can see that although the packet delivery ratios of 
both protocols decrease as long as the velocity of vehicles 
rises, our protocol still perform better, because the MGRP 
utilizes the 3G network and gateway controller to assist packet 
forwarding so that link disconnect due to high mobility can be 
greatly avoided. Notice that the packet delivery ratio of 
MGRP is lower than GPSR when vehicles’ velocity is over 85 
km/h. The reason is that MGRP has to frequently maintain the 
routing table in high velocity scenarios. As a result, it may 
raise the opportunity of packets lost. 
Fig. 8 shows the average hop count to the maximum speed. 
The results reveal that the average hop count increases when 
the velocity of vehicles rises regardless of MGRP or GPSR. 
The MGRP can keep count within 6 while the maximum hop 
count in GPSR is 10. It is because of the fact that we use 3G 
network to reduce the transmission hops. In addition, we limit 
the hop counts when the source vehicle intends to find a route 
to the gateway vehicle or destination vehicle.  
Fig. 9 shows the routing overhead versa the maximum 
speed. The results show that the packet overhead increases 
when the velocity of vehicles rises regardless of MGRP or 
GPSR. The packet overhead in MGRP is more than GPSR 
because we need to maintain the routing table. However, by

Abstract
Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are an emerging area of interest for the security
community. Due to the scale of the network, the speed of the vehicles, their geographic
positions, and the very sporadic connectivity between them, security issues of VANETs
are very challenging, especially on how to ensure the authenticity of emergency messages
efficiently. In this paper, we propose a secure aggregated message authentication (SAMA)
scheme in certificateless public key settings to validate emergency messages for VANETs.
We make use of aggregation and batch verification techniques for emergency message ver-
ification to reduce the computation overhead. Moreover, the SAMA scheme is modelled
and analyzed with Petri nets. Our analysis shows that the SAMA scheme can successfully
defend forgery attacks and ensure the conditional privacy preservation and traceability of
vehicles.

INTRODUCTION
Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) can be divided into inter-vehicle communications
(IVC) and roadside-to-vehicle communications (RVC) that require roadside unit (RSU)
equipment. The main goal of VANETs is to achieve safety and comfort for passengers.
In VANETs, each vehicle equipped with an on-board unit (OBU) can receive and relay
messages through the wireless network without predefined or centralized infrastructure.
Vehicle-collision warning, road sign alarms, and in-place traffic view will give the driver
essential tools to decide the best path along the way.
Due to the scale of the network, the speed of the vehicles, their geographic positions,
and the very sporadic connectivity between them, security issues of VANETs are very
1
messages. Therefore, the privacy preservation in VANETs should be conditional, i.e.,
senders are anonymous to receivers while traceable by the KGC, namely conditional pri-
vacy preservation (4). With traceability, once a dispute occurs to the emergency message,
the KGC can reveal the identities of the vehicles.
Moreover, Petri nets (12) may be used to infer what an attacker could know if he happens
to know certain items in the security protocol. We used Petri nets in the security analysis
of the proposed scheme. Our analysis shows that the proposed scheme can successfully
defend forgery attacks and ensure the conditional privacy preservation and traceability of
the vehicles.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we state the concept of bi-
linear pairings and introduce the mathematical problems used in this paper. Next, the
proposed SAMA scheme is presented in Section III. Then, we shall present the security
analysis of our SAMA scheme and provide a performance comparison with other aggre-
gated signature schemes in Section IV. Finally, we will conclude our paper in Section V.
PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we first briefly state the concepts of bilinear pairings and introduce the
mathematical problems needed for our proof of security. The notations with their mean-
ings throughout this paper are listed in Table 1.
Bilinear Pairings
Let G1 be a cyclic additive group of 160-bit prime order q and G2 be a cyclic multiplicative
group of the same order. A map e : G1 ×G1 → G2 is called a bilinear map if it satisfies
the following properties:
1. Bilinearity: e(Q,W +Z) = e(Q,W )e(Q,Z) and e(Q+W,Z) = e(Q,Z)e(W,Z), for
all Q,W,Z ∈ G1.
2. Non-degeneracy: There exists P,Q ∈ G1 such that e(P,Q) ̸= 1.
3. Computable: There is an efficient algorithm to compute e(P,Q) for P,Q ∈ G1.
Mathematical Problems
Now we specify the mathematical difficult problems used in this paper as follows.
Definition 1. Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP). Given a prime p, a generator g
of Z∗p, and an element β ∈ Z∗p, the DLP is to find the integer α, 0 ≤ α ≤ p− 2, such that
gα ≡ β (mod p).
Definition 2. Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Given a
group G1 of prime order q, two elements P and Q, the ECDLP is to find an integer l ∈ Z∗q,
such that Q = lP whenever such an integer exists.

• Message authentication Similar to wireless sensor networks (15; 16), the ma-
jor threat that can target specifically VANET aggregation schemes is that of false
information dissemination, where attacker’s goal is to make the vehicles to accept
false emergency reports. Therefore, emergency messages from vehicles have to be
authenticated to confirm that they are indeed sent unaltered.
• Conditional privacy preservation Privacy preservation is regarded as a funda-
mental security requirement in VANET communications since overhearing privacy-
sensitive information could happen frequently. However, privacy protection may
be abused by malicious drivers. Therefore, conditional privacy preservation should
be provided in VANETs, i.e., senders are anonymous to receivers while traceable
by the KGC, such that the identities can be uniquely revealed by the KGC under
exceptional cases.
• Traceability The KGC should have the ability to retrieve a vehicle’s real-identity
from its pseudo-identity once a dispute occurs to the emergency message.
System Setup
Prior to the network deployment, the KGC sets up the system parameters as follows:
1. Let G1 be a cyclic additive group generated by P with a prime order q, and G2 be
a cyclic multiplicative group of the same order. Let e : G1 ×G1 → G2 be a bilinear
map.
2. The KGC first chooses a random number s ∈ Z∗q as its master key and sets Ppub = sP
as its public key.
3. The KGC defines hash functions H1 : {0, 1}∗ → G1, H2 : {0, 1}∗ → G1, and
H3 : {0, 1}∗ → Z∗q, and a secure symmetric encryption algorithm Enc(·) (13).
4. The KGC publishes the system parameters (G1,G2, e, P, Ppub, H1(·), H2(·), H3(·), Enc(·)).
5
Thus, (Typei, Loci, P IDj, T ime
i
j, Sig
i
j, PKj) constitutes a SER claim. After that, Vj
broadcasts SERij to its neighbors.
Given SERij = (Typei, Loci, P IDj, T ime
i
j, Sig
i
j, PKj), a single SER verification can be
performed by a verifier as follows.
1. The verifier first computes a triple (Qj,Wi, Sj) as follows.
Qj = H1(PIDj) (8)
Wi = H2(Typei‖Loci) (9)
Sj = H3(Typei‖Loci‖Timeij‖PIDj‖PKj) (10)
2. After that, the verifier checks the validity of the signature as follows.
e(Sigij, P )
?
= e(QjSj, Ppub)e(Wi, PKj) (11)
If equation (11) holds, the signature is accepted. The correctness of equation (11)
can be checked as follows:
e(Sigij, P ) = e(DjSj + xjWi, P )
= e(DjSj, P )e(xjWi, P )
= e(sQjSj, P )e(Wi, xjP )
= e(QjSj, sP )e(Wi, xjP )
= e(QjSj, Ppub)e(Wi, PKj)
(12)
Aggregated Authentication
Aggregated authentication consists of two parts, signature aggregation and batch verifi-
cation. The detailed procedures are presented as below.
• Signature aggregation For a specific emergency event Ei, any vehicle can act as
an aggregate signature generator, namely aggregator, who can aggregate a collection
of individual signatures that have the same event statement, Typei and Loci. Given
n SERs, where SERij = (Typei, Loci, P IDj, T ime
i
j, Sig
i
j, PKj) by Vj(1 ≤ j ≤ n),
the aggregator can obtain SERagg as follows.
SERagg = (Typei, Loci, P ID1, P ID2, . . . , P IDn,
T imei1, T ime
i
2, . . . , T ime
i
n,
Sigi1, Sig
i
2, . . . , Sig
i
n,
PK1, PK2, . . . , PKn) (13)
Then the aggregator computes Sigagg as follows.
Sigagg =
n∑
j=1
Sigij
=
n∑
j=1
(DjSj + xjWi) (14)

Table 2: Formal definition of a Petri net.
A Petri net is a 5-tuple, (P, T, F,W,M0) where:
P = {P1, P2, · · · , Pm} is a finite set of places,
T = {T1, T2, · · · , Tn} is a finite set of transitions,
F ⊆ (P × T ) ∪ (T × P ) is a set of arcs (flow relation),
W : F → {1, 2, 3, · · ·} is a weight function,
M0 : P → {0, 1, 2, 3, · · ·} is the initial marking,
P ∩ T = Ø and P ∪ T ̸= Ø.
A Petri net structure N = (P, T, F,W ) without any specific initial marking is de-
noted by N .
A Petri net with the given initial marking is denoted by (N,M0).
ANALYSIS OF THE SAMA SCHEME
In this section, we show that the SAMA scheme can resist forgery attacks and ensure the
conditional privacy preservation and traceability of vehicles. In addition, we provide a
performance comparison with other aggregate signature schemes for VANETs.
Security Analysis
We shall use Petri nets (12) to model and analyze the proposed scheme. Next, security
properties of our scheme will be specified.
Petri Net Model
We used a Petri net to model the SER generation of the SAMA scheme. The formal
definition of a Petri net (17) is listed in Table 2. Petri nets are composed from graphi-
cal symbols designating places (shown as circles), transitions (shown as rectangles), and
directed arcs (shown as arrows). The places denote (atomic and composite) data items.
The transitions denote decryption or decomposition operations. The directed arcs run
between places and transitions.
When a transition fires, a composite data item is decomposed or decrypted, resulting
in one or more simpler data items. Since we assume an open network environment,
all data items in the transmitted messages are assumed to be public, and are known
to the attacker. There will be tokens in the places representing the data items in the
transmitted messages initially. From this initial marking, we can infer what an attacker
can know eventually. Furthermore, we can also experiment what an attacker can know
if he knows additional data items from other sources. The Petri net model is illustrated
in Figure 3. The definitions of the places and transitions used in this model are listed in
Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. We use the HPSim Petri net tool (18) to model our
proposed scheme.
Security Properties
We now analyze the security properties of our scheme. The security of the proposed
scheme is based on the difficulty of ECDLP, which is believed infeasible to solve in poly-
nomial time. We will show that our scheme can resist forgery attacks and ensure the
conditional privacy preservation and traceability of vehicles.

Theorem 2. The proposed scheme can ensure the conditional privacy preservation of
vehicles.
Proof. In the SAMA scheme, we propose to use pseudo-identities to preserve the identity
privacy of witness vehicles. Since the vehicle Vj uses the pseudo-identity PIDj during
its communication with other vehicles, the real-identity IDj is protected. As shown in
Figure 3, constituting SERij and broadcasting SER
i
j to the verifier are defined in transi-
tion T4 and T5, respectively. Transition T4 has six input places, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and
P10. Place P3 is the value of PIDj. However, only the KGC has the ability to trace the
real-identity from the pseudo-identity PIDj. Hence, the conditional privacy preservation
can be satisfied in the proposed scheme. 
Theorem 3. The proposed scheme can provide the traceability of vehicles.
Proof. Given the pseudo-identity PIDj, only the KGC, with the master key s, can trace
the real-identity as follows.
Decs(PIDj) = Decs(Encs(IDj))
= IDj (24)
Therefore, once a dispute occurs to the emergency message, the KGC has the ability to
reveal the real-identity of the vehicle from the disputed message, in which the traceability
can be achieved. 
Performance Evaluation
We use the computation and communication overhead as the metric to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the proposed SAMA scheme. The evaluation parameters are defined in Table 5.
The performance comparison between Zhu et al.’s scheme (8) and the SAMA scheme is
presented in Table 6. According to the implementation results in (19), which observes
processing time (in milliseconds) for an MNT curve of embedding degree k = 6 and 160-
bit q, running on an Intel Pentium IV 3.0 GHz machine, TP is 4.5 ms and TM is 0.6 ms.
Therefore, elliptic curve point multiplication operations are much cheaper in comparison
to pairing operations.
From Table 6, Zhu et al.’s scheme (8) requires five pairings for verifying n distinct sig-
natures and certificates; however, in the SAMA scheme, it requires only three pairings
for verifying n distinct signatures without certificates. Therefore, our proposed scheme
achieves better time efficiency than Zhu et al.’s scheme (8).

proposed approach. The proposed ECDD is based on a passive 
clustering mechanism to build and maintain clusters and uses a 
first declaration wins [8][9] mechanism to select cluster heads. 
With the first declaration wins mechanism, a node which first 
claims to be the cluster head will become the cluster head of its 
clustered area (in the radio coverage) and manages nodes in 
this clustered area [8][9]. The proposed ECDD does not use 
waiting periods (to make sure all the neighbors have been 
checked) [8], which is used in all other weight-driven 
clustering mechanisms, to select the best node to be the cluster 
head [8]. Once the cluster formation is finished, all nodes can 
be categorized into three types: cluster head, cluster member, 
and border node. A cluster head has the responsibility to 
manage cluster members and border nodes in its clustered area. 
A border node is a node which is in the communication range 
of two or more different clusters. The main tasks of a cluster 
member are receiving interests from its cluster head and 
forwarding sensed data that match the received interests to its 
cluster head. We make the following assumptions in the 
proposed ECDD: 
y The sink has unlimited memory, processing capability and 
rechargeable battery. That is, the energy of the sink can be 
recharged anytime [14]. 
y All sensor nodes besides the sink have the same 
processing capability. 
y Initially, the hop count of the sink is set to 0 and the hop 
count of each node other than the sink is set to the total 
number of sensor nodes in the sensor field. 
y The cluster formation is complete before any data 
gathering and transmission begins [5]. 
A. Piggybacked control information in an interest 
The piggybacked control information in the interests is used 
to set the hop count of each node for selecting an efficient data 
dissemination path and an energy threshold of each node for 
reconstructing clusters. In the proposed ECDD, we extend the 
piggybacked control information proposed by [11] by adding 
two more fields: HOP_COUNT and 
ENERGY_THRESHOLD, as shown in Figure 1.  
 
 
 Once a sensor node receives an interest, it updates a 
neighbor information table according to the piggybacked 
control information in the interest. The neighbor information 
table contains the following information: NEIGHBOR_ID, 
NEIGHBOR_STATUS, and NEIGHBOR_HOP_COUNT. 
NEIGHBOR_ID is used to identify which neighbor is referred 
by this information record. NEIGHBOR_STATUS keeps track 
of which type of this neighbor is. NEIGHBOR_HOP_COUNT 
represents the total hop counts from this neighbor to the sink. 
According to the neighbor information table, a sensor node 
selects the next forwarding node with the least hop count, and 
thus a shortest data dissemination path to forward sensed data 
back to the sink can be found. 
B. Cluster formation and data dissemination path selection 
If a cluster-based sensor network has not been initialized, 
the cluster formation mechanism will be performed. In the 
proposed ECDD algorithm, we design a novel cluster 
formation mechanism which utilizes hop count information in 
each sensor node. After the cluster formation mechanism is 
finished, the data dissemination path selection process can 
make use of the updated hop count information in each sensor 
node to select a data dissemination path from source to sink 
with low delay. 
1) Cluster formation 
Initially, the hop count of each node is set to the total 
number of sensor nodes in the sensor field. When an interest is 
propagated into the sensor field for the first time, the cluster 
formation mechanism will be performed, and the interest will 
be propagated to all sensor nodes in the sensor field. Before the 
interest is propagated into the sensor field, the HOP_COUNT 
field in a piggybacked interest will be set to the value of the 
hop count stored in the sink plus one. When a sensor node 
receives the interest, the sensor node will compare its hop 
count with the value stored in the HOP_COUNT field of the 
received interest. If the hop count value stored in the sensor 
node is larger than the value of the HOP_COUNT field in the 
received interest, the sensor node updates its hop count by the 
value stored in the HOP_COUNT field of the received interest. 
Otherwise, the interest will be discarded. Then, the sensor 
node checks whether there are more interests coming in or not. 
If the sensor node receives other interests, the sensor node 
must compare the hop count value with the value of the 
HOP_COUNT field in the recently received interests again to 
decide whether the hop count value needs to be updated or not. 
If the sensor node does not receive any more interests, it 
replaces the value of the HOP_COUNT field in the received 
interest with the value of the sensor node’s hop count plus 1. 
Finally, the sensor node sends the updated interest to other 
sensor nodes. When an interest is diffused throughout the 
entire sensor field, each node will be set a new hop count. 
 Figure 2 illustrates flowcharts of the actions taken by cluster 
heads, cluster members, and border nodes. Figure 2(a) shows 
the actions taken by a cluster head. After the cluster formation 
is finished, a cluster head will piggyback its ID, status, and the 
hop count value plus 1 into the NODE_ID, STATUS, and 
HOP_COUNT fields in the received interest. After finishing 
the update of the received interest, the cluster head then 
rebroadcasts the updated interest to its cluster members and 
border nodes. Figure 2(b) illustrates the actions taken by a 
cluster member. If a cluster member receives a modified 
interest, the cluster member will replace its hop count with the 
HOP_COUNT in the modified interest. The cluster member 
also stores NODE_ID, STATUS and HOP_COUNT minus 1 
in the modified interest to the neighbor information table.  
Figure 2(c) depicts the actions taken by a border node. If a 
border node receives a modified interest, the border node will 
compare its hop count with the HOP_COUNT of the modified 
interest. If the HOP_COUNT in the modified interest is larger 
than the border node’s hop count, the border node stores 
NODE_ID, STATUS, and HOP_COUNT minus 1 in the 
modified interest to the corresponding fields in the neighbor 
information table, then discards the interest. Otherwise, the

57-byte, 49-byte and 36-byte long for ECDD, ELPC, and DD, 
respectively. The initial energy of a sensor node is 10 J. The 
transmit power is 0.66 W and the receive power is 0.395 W. 
The simulation time is 1000 seconds. We evaluate each 
scheme with the following parameters: average dissipated 
energy, average delay, throughput, and the time till the first 
node death, which are defined as follows. 
 
 
z Average dissipated energy 
The average dissipated energy (Eavg) measures the ratio of 
total dissipated energy of all nodes in the network to the 
number of distinct events seen by the sink [3][4], as defined in 
equation (1).

where Eik is the initial energy of the kth node, Efk is the final 
energy of the kth node, m is the total number of sensor nodes, 
and n is the total number of events. 
z Average delay 
The average delay (Davg) measures the average transmission 
time of events, which indicates the average latency between a 
source that transmits an event and the sink that receives the 
event [14]. The definition of Davg is as follows:

event is received by the sink, and n is the total number of

Throughput =            (3) 
z The time till the first node death (FND) [6] 
The FND represents the timestamp that the first sensor node 
dies due to the depletion of energy [6]. It indicates whether the 
energy consumption of nodes in the sensor field is balanced or 
not. 
B. Comparison of the proposed ECDD with DD and ELPC 
Figure 4 shows the average dissipated energy of DD, ELPC 
and ECDD. Because the ELPC protocol only floods interests 
among cluster heads and border nodes, it consumes less energy 
than DD. However, the ELPC protocol also floods the 
exploratory data messages to find a forwarding path, which 
causes additional energy consumption. The energy 
consumption of ECDD is the lowest because ECDD uses a 
cluster-based scheme to avoid the interests flooding problem 
and uses hop count information to avoid the exploratory data 
message flooding problem. Simulation results show that 
ECDD is 61.30% and 22.33% better than DD and ELPC, 
respectively, in terms of average dissipated energy. 
Figure 5 shows the average delay of each approach. In 
ELPC, the average delay is better than that of DD because 
ELPC uses clusters to reduce the number of flooded 
exploratory data messages. Although the number of flooded 
exploratory data messages in ELPC is decreased, the flooding 
problem still exists and it causes additional overheads. The 
proposed ECDD has the lowest average delay because we use 
hop count information to further eliminate flooding of 
exploratory data messages. Simulation results in Figure 5  
show that in terms of the average delay,  the proposed ECDD is 
57.45% and 23.49% better than DD and ELPC, respectively. 
Figure 6 shows the comparison of throughput. Although 
ELPC reduces the degree of the interest flooding problem by 
using clusters, which makes ELPC better than DD, ELPC still 
must flood exploratory data messages among cluster heads and 
border nodes to find a forwarding path. By piggybacking 
additional control information into interests, ECDD can 
establish clusters by sending interests from the sink. Thus, it 
has the highest throughput. Simulation results show that the 
proposed ECDD is 55.54% and 15.85% better than DD and 
ELPC, in terms of throughput. 
Figure 7 Figure 7 shows the comparison of the time till that 
the first node death (FND) among the proposed ECDD, DD, 
and ELPC. Because both ELPC and ECDD use a cluster-based 
mechanism, cluster heads and border nodes will deplete their 
energy faster than cluster members. In spite of the energy 
consumption of each node is balanced in ELPC, the amount of 
exploratory data messages will increase when the network 
scale increases. Thus, it causes cluster heads and border nodes

proposed approach. The proposed ECDD is based on a passive 
clustering mechanism to build and maintain clusters and uses a 
first declaration wins [8][9] mechanism to select cluster heads. 
With the first declaration wins mechanism, a node which first 
claims to be the cluster head will become the cluster head of its 
clustered area (in the radio coverage) and manages nodes in 
this clustered area [8][9]. The proposed ECDD does not use 
waiting periods (to make sure all the neighbors have been 
checked) [8], which is used in all other weight-driven 
clustering mechanisms, to select the best node to be the cluster 
head [8]. Once the cluster formation is finished, all nodes can 
be categorized into three types: cluster head, cluster member, 
and border node. A cluster head has the responsibility to 
manage cluster members and border nodes in its clustered area. 
A border node is a node which is in the communication range 
of two or more different clusters. The main tasks of a cluster 
member are receiving interests from its cluster head and 
forwarding sensed data that match the received interests to its 
cluster head. We make the following assumptions in the 
proposed ECDD: 
y The sink has unlimited memory, processing capability and 
rechargeable battery. That is, the energy of the sink can be 
recharged anytime [14]. 
y All sensor nodes besides the sink have the same 
processing capability. 
y Initially, the hop count of the sink is set to 0 and the hop 
count of each node other than the sink is set to the total 
number of sensor nodes in the sensor field. 
y The cluster formation is complete before any data 
gathering and transmission begins [5]. 
A. Piggybacked control information in an interest 
The piggybacked control information in the interests is used 
to set the hop count of each node for selecting an efficient data 
dissemination path and an energy threshold of each node for 
reconstructing clusters. In the proposed ECDD, we extend the 
piggybacked control information proposed by [11] by adding 
two more fields: HOP_COUNT and 
ENERGY_THRESHOLD, as shown in Figure 1.  
 
 
 Once a sensor node receives an interest, it updates a 
neighbor information table according to the piggybacked 
control information in the interest. The neighbor information 
table contains the following information: NEIGHBOR_ID, 
NEIGHBOR_STATUS, and NEIGHBOR_HOP_COUNT. 
NEIGHBOR_ID is used to identify which neighbor is referred 
by this information record. NEIGHBOR_STATUS keeps track 
of which type of this neighbor is. NEIGHBOR_HOP_COUNT 
represents the total hop counts from this neighbor to the sink. 
According to the neighbor information table, a sensor node 
selects the next forwarding node with the least hop count, and 
thus a shortest data dissemination path to forward sensed data 
back to the sink can be found. 
B. Cluster formation and data dissemination path selection 
If a cluster-based sensor network has not been initialized, 
the cluster formation mechanism will be performed. In the 
proposed ECDD algorithm, we design a novel cluster 
formation mechanism which utilizes hop count information in 
each sensor node. After the cluster formation mechanism is 
finished, the data dissemination path selection process can 
make use of the updated hop count information in each sensor 
node to select a data dissemination path from source to sink 
with low delay. 
1) Cluster formation 
Initially, the hop count of each node is set to the total 
number of sensor nodes in the sensor field. When an interest is 
propagated into the sensor field for the first time, the cluster 
formation mechanism will be performed, and the interest will 
be propagated to all sensor nodes in the sensor field. Before the 
interest is propagated into the sensor field, the HOP_COUNT 
field in a piggybacked interest will be set to the value of the 
hop count stored in the sink plus one. When a sensor node 
receives the interest, the sensor node will compare its hop 
count with the value stored in the HOP_COUNT field of the 
received interest. If the hop count value stored in the sensor 
node is larger than the value of the HOP_COUNT field in the 
received interest, the sensor node updates its hop count by the 
value stored in the HOP_COUNT field of the received interest. 
Otherwise, the interest will be discarded. Then, the sensor 
node checks whether there are more interests coming in or not. 
If the sensor node receives other interests, the sensor node 
must compare the hop count value with the value of the 
HOP_COUNT field in the recently received interests again to 
decide whether the hop count value needs to be updated or not. 
If the sensor node does not receive any more interests, it 
replaces the value of the HOP_COUNT field in the received 
interest with the value of the sensor node’s hop count plus 1. 
Finally, the sensor node sends the updated interest to other 
sensor nodes. When an interest is diffused throughout the 
entire sensor field, each node will be set a new hop count. 
 Figure 2 illustrates flowcharts of the actions taken by cluster 
heads, cluster members, and border nodes. Figure 2(a) shows 
the actions taken by a cluster head. After the cluster formation 
is finished, a cluster head will piggyback its ID, status, and the 
hop count value plus 1 into the NODE_ID, STATUS, and 
HOP_COUNT fields in the received interest. After finishing 
the update of the received interest, the cluster head then 
rebroadcasts the updated interest to its cluster members and 
border nodes. Figure 2(b) illustrates the actions taken by a 
cluster member. If a cluster member receives a modified 
interest, the cluster member will replace its hop count with the 
HOP_COUNT in the modified interest. The cluster member 
also stores NODE_ID, STATUS and HOP_COUNT minus 1 
in the modified interest to the neighbor information table.  
Figure 2(c) depicts the actions taken by a border node. If a 
border node receives a modified interest, the border node will 
compare its hop count with the HOP_COUNT of the modified 
interest. If the HOP_COUNT in the modified interest is larger 
than the border node’s hop count, the border node stores 
NODE_ID, STATUS, and HOP_COUNT minus 1 in the 
modified interest to the corresponding fields in the neighbor 
information table, then discards the interest. Otherwise, the

57-byte, 49-byte and 36-byte long for ECDD, ELPC, and DD, 
respectively. The initial energy of a sensor node is 10 J. The 
transmit power is 0.66 W and the receive power is 0.395 W. 
The simulation time is 1000 seconds. We evaluate each 
scheme with the following parameters: average dissipated 
energy, average delay, throughput, and the time till the first 
node death, which are defined as follows. 
 
 
z Average dissipated energy 
The average dissipated energy (Eavg) measures the ratio of 
total dissipated energy of all nodes in the network to the 
number of distinct events seen by the sink [3][4], as defined in 
equation (1).

where Eik is the initial energy of the kth node, Efk is the final 
energy of the kth node, m is the total number of sensor nodes, 
and n is the total number of events. 
z Average delay 
The average delay (Davg) measures the average transmission 
time of events, which indicates the average latency between a 
source that transmits an event and the sink that receives the 
event [14]. The definition of Davg is as follows:

transmitted from the sink, Tei is the timestamp when the ith 
event is received by the sink, and n is the total number of 
events.

Throughput =            (3) 
z The time till the first node death (FND) [6] 
The FND represents the timestamp that the first sensor node 
dies due to the depletion of energy [6]. It indicates whether the 
energy consumption of nodes in the sensor field is balanced or 
not. 
B. Comparison of the proposed ECDD with DD and ELPC 
Figure 4 shows the average dissipated energy of DD, ELPC 
and ECDD. Because the ELPC protocol only floods interests 
among cluster heads and border nodes, it consumes less energy 
than DD. However, the ELPC protocol also floods the 
exploratory data messages to find a forwarding path, which 
causes additional energy consumption. The energy 
consumption of ECDD is the lowest because ECDD uses a 
cluster-based scheme to avoid the interests flooding problem 
and uses hop count information to avoid the exploratory data 
message flooding problem. Simulation results show that 
ECDD is 61.30% and 22.33% better than DD and ELPC, 
respectively, in terms of average dissipated energy. 
Figure 5 shows the average delay of each approach. In 
ELPC, the average delay is better than that of DD because 
ELPC uses clusters to reduce the number of flooded 
exploratory data messages. Although the number of flooded 
exploratory data messages in ELPC is decreased, the flooding 
problem still exists and it causes additional overheads. The 
proposed ECDD has the lowest average delay because we use 
hop count information to further eliminate flooding of 
exploratory data messages. Simulation results in Figure 5  
show that in terms of the average delay,  the proposed ECDD is 
57.45% and 23.49% better than DD and ELPC, respectively. 
Figure 6 shows the comparison of throughput. Although 
ELPC reduces the degree of the interest flooding problem by 
using clusters, which makes ELPC better than DD, ELPC still 
must flood exploratory data messages among cluster heads and 
border nodes to find a forwarding path. By piggybacking 
additional control information into interests, ECDD can 
establish clusters by sending interests from the sink. Thus, it 
has the highest throughput. Simulation results show that the 
proposed ECDD is 55.54% and 15.85% better than DD and 
ELPC, in terms of throughput. 
Figure 7 Figure 7 shows the comparison of the time till that 
the first node death (FND) among the proposed ECDD, DD, 
and ELPC. Because both ELPC and ECDD use a cluster-based 
mechanism, cluster heads and border nodes will deplete their 
energy faster than cluster members. In spite of the energy 
consumption of each node is balanced in ELPC, the amount of 
exploratory data messages will increase when the network 
scale increases. Thus, it causes cluster heads and border nodes 
to deplete their energy faster than that of the proposed ECDD. 
Simulation results show that the proposed ECDD is 71.62% 
and 24.40% better than DD and ELPC, respectively, in terms 
of FND.
