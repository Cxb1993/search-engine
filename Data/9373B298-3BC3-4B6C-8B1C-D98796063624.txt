The above formula can be a rough calculation of two 
parameters (Wf) and (Wgap). In this design, the signal width (Wf) 
is assumed as 80μm, and then the length of the gap (Wgap) can 
be calculated as 40μm. 
 Next, the design of antenna structure is using PIFA structure. 
There can be divided three parts of this structure: a) radiator 
part, b) the ground plane, and c) short-circuited part.  
For the radiator parts, monopole antenna is used in this 
design. The main operating principle is using the ground plane 
and the image theory. As the result, the size of the monopole 
can be half of the traditional half-wave antenna. In other words, 
the antenna length only requires quarter of the wave length to 
obtain the radiation function. This is another reason why the 
CPW is chosen to be the feed structure since the CPW structure 
provides enough large ground plane for the monopole antenna 
design. For the ground plane, the CPW structure can provide 
enough large ground size in this design. However, limited by 
chip area restriction, the size of the ground plane occupied only 
for a certain area. For the short-circuited part, the significant 
part of this proposed antenna, it not only affects the impedance 
matching and bandwidth but also the antenna gain. In this 
design, a metal square is added to connect the antenna and the 
ground plane. As shown in Fig. 1, the yellow part is the radiator 
part, the blue part is the ground plane part and the green part is 
the short-circuited part. Meanwhile, the detail dimension of this 
design is shown in Table 1. In addition, for the probe 
measurement consideration, the pitch of the feed structure, 
CPW structure, has been 100μm and the PAD layer has been 
added on the top layer of this design. As the result, it needs not 
add the RF pad cell in this proposed antenna.

III. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 
The simulation and measurement VSWR results are 
shown in Fig. 2. From the result, the measurement agrees with 
the simulation. The measurement impedance bandwidth is 
about 27GHz from 40GHz to 67GHz. For the radiation pattern 
and antenna gain, the simulation result of the horizontal plane is

substrate and acrylic. However, these setups degrade the 
antenna performance so that the antenna gain we obtained is 
lower.
