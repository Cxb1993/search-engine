二、英文摘要 
The reliability related properties of an 
InAlAs/InGaAs metamorphic high electron 
mobility transistor (MHEMT), using the 
non-annealed Ohmic-recess (NAOR) approach, 
are studied and demonstrated. The NAOR 
device shows significantly improved DC and 
radio frequency (RF) performance over a wide 
temperature range (300-500K). With a 1×100 
μm2 gate-dimension MHEMT by NAOR 
approach, the considerably improved thermal 
stability and DC performance, including lower 
temperature variation coefficients on turn-on 
voltage (-1.38 mV/K), gate-drain breakdown 
voltage (-30.4 mV/K), and on-resistance 
(2.41×10-3 Ω·mm/K), are obtained as the 
temperature is increased from 300 to 500K. For 
RF characteristics, the NAOR device also 
shows low degradation rate on drain saturation 
current operating regimes (-5.52×10-4/K) as the 
temperature is increased from 300 to 400 K. In 
addition, based on the lifetime tests, an 
activation energy of 1.33 eV and a projected 
median lifetime of 1.2 × 107 h at Tch=125℃ 
are obtained for the NAOR MHEMT. 
 
三、計劃緣由與目的 
In the recent years, the metamorphic high 
electron mobility transistors (MHEMTs) have 
attracted considerable attention because they 
combine the advantages of InP-based HEMT 
layer structures with GaAs substrates. The 
metamorphic structure offers a variable channel 
 3
chemical etching to build the air-bridge gate 
structure which included multiple piers under 
the gate-feeder metal.9 For the conventional 
mesa type devices, the gate-feeder metal lying 
on the mesa sidewall of the narrow-gap channel 
causes the higher gate leakage current, 
additional parasitic capacitance, and impact 
ionization effect. However, by using the 
air-bridge type devices in this work, these 
undesirable problems can be effectively 
reduced and eliminated. For comparison, a 
conventional device, denoted as device B, was 
fabricated by the same process sequence only 
without the NAOR approach. For device B, the 
drain/source Ohmic contacts were formed on 
cap layer by evaporating AuGe/Au metals and 
alloyed at 330℃ for 12 s. The gate dimension 
of 1×100 μm2 was used for devices A and B in 
this work. 
 
五、實驗結果與討論 
Figure 2 shows the turn-on voltage (Von), 
gate-drain breakdown voltage (BVGD), 
Schottky barrier height (ΦB), and ideality factor 
(n) as a function of temperature. The Von and 
BVGD values are measured under the gate 
currents of IG = 1 and -0.5 mA/mm, 
respectively. Clearly, at 300 K, the higher 
turn-on voltage (0.56 V) and gate-drain 
breakdown voltage (22.93 V) are observed in 
device A. Even at higher temperature regimes, 
the studied device with the NAOR approach 
(device A) still maintains high Von and BVGD. 
The temperature variation rates, i.e., ∂Von/∂T 
and ∂BVGD/∂T, are -1.38 (-1.44) mV/K and 
-30.4 (-31.5) mV/K for device A (B), 
respectively, as the temperature is increased 
from 300 to 500K. Clearly, device A reveals 
lower temperature coefficients of performance 
degradation. It should be noted that the 
undesirable lateral diffusion of Ohmic metal 
within n+ regions is caused by alloying and/or 
the thermal treatment. This leads to the large 
field near the drain terminal as well as poor 
breakdown voltage at gate-drain terminal. The 
undesired lateral diffusion could be effectively 
suppressed in device A(NAOR) because of the 
use of NAOR approach. Furthermore, in 
contrast to the conventional InP- and 
GaAs-based HEMTs,10-11 the device A (NAOR) 
shows relatively temperature independent 
characteristics in terms of BVGD and Von. This 
demonstrates the importance of reducing the 
electric field at the drain side. Moreover, within 
the temperature range of 300-500K, the 
thermal-stable Schottky characteristics of 
devices with Ti/Au gate metal have been 
achieved. On the other hand, even operating 
under higher temperature of 500K, the 
improved ΦB and n are obtained for device A 
(0.72 eV and 1.23), which are better than those 
of device B (0.69 eV and 1.25). The slightly 
higher ideality factors are presumably caused 
by the spatial inhomogeneity of the contact area 
and/or the native oxide between the gate and 
InAlAs Schottky barrier layer.12 However, it is 
found that the differences of Schottky barrier 
height and ideality factor between devices A 
and B are negligible. Due to the merit 
mentioned above, the studied device with 
NAOR processes and Ti/Au gate metal are 
suitable for high-breakdown rectifying 
applications. 
The maximum extrinsic transconductance 
(gm,max) and on-resistance (Ron) as a function of 
temperature are illustrated in Fig. 3. The Ron is 
determined from the slope of linear region by 
the extraction of drain current (ID) versus 
drain-source voltage (VDS) curves. The gm,max 
value of device A (B) is decreased from 302.4 
(261.2) to 269.6 (214.9) mS/mm as the 
temperature is increased from 300 to 500K. On 
the contrary, the corresponding Ron value of the 
studied device is increased from 1.82 (2.34) to 
2.35 (3.29) Ω·mm for device A (B). The Ron 
and intrinsic transconductance (gmi) can be 
expressed as:13-14

preventing the Au metal diffusing into the 
active structure and eliminating the leakage 
current.11,17 
In order to determine the life time at 
operation temperature, the biased accelerated 
lifetime tests are performed at 400, 430, and 
460 K. The ID cumulative error versus stress 
time of the studied device is depicted in Fig. 4. 
The accelerated stress bias voltage is fixed at 
VDS = 3 V and VGS = 0 V. The ID is obtained 
from the bias condition of VGS = 0 V and VDS = 
2.5 V. For DC biased accelerated stress tests, 
the failure criterion is defined as a 15 ％ 
degradation of ID. The measured median time 
to failure (MTTF) of device A (B) at 400, 430, 
and 460 K are 3601.2 (2588.1), 712.3 (554.1), 
and 216.3 (172.5) hours, respectively. Most of 
the device degradation is assumed to be related 
to the interdiffusion of elements and hence can 
be modeled at a temperature of T and activation 
energy of Ea :7

where Ea denotes the activation energy and A 
represents thr constant value. Figure 5 shows 
the median time to failure (MTTF) versus the 
reciprocal of the channel temperature. 
Experimentally, the life time of studied device 
A (B) with 1.2 × 107 (6.6 × 106) hours at Tch = 
398 K and Ea = 1.33 (1.27) eV is obtained. A 
comparison with other life time investigations 
on HEMT reveals the strong potential of 
NAOR devices in high-reliability circuit 
applications.18-19 
Figure 6 reveals the unity current gain 
cut-off frequency (fT), maximum oscillation 
frequency (fmax), and IDS operating regime (>0.8 
maximum values of fT, fmax) as a function of 
temperature. The inset shows microwave 
characteristics of the device A at 250, 300, 350, 
and 400K. The biased voltages are fixed at VDS 
= 2.5 V and VGS = -0.1 V of devices A and B. 
For device A (B), the fT and fmax are 20.5 (16.1) 
GHz and 62.3 (54.2) GHz at 300K, respectively. 
Even at 400 K, the corresponding fT and fmax 
still maintain 19.2 (13.4) and 55.5 (40.7) GHz, 
respectively. Obviously, it is found that the 
device A shows improved microwave 
characteristics. This is caused by the reduction 
of the Rp and increase of the corresponding gm 
by the NAOR approach. Hence, due to the 
lower Rp and higher gm, the fT and fmax values of 
device A are higher than those of device B. In 
addition, the studied device A (B) maintains 
80% of its fT and fmax peak values over large IDS 
operating regimes of 233 (131), 227 (128), and 
220 (121) mA/mm at T=300, 350, and 400K, 
respectively. The degradation rate (∂IDS/IDS 
×1/∂T) in IDS operating regimes (-5.52×10-4/K) 
of device A is relatively insignificant as the 
temperature is increased from 300 to 400K. 
Thus, by using the NAOR approach, the 
studied device with good linearity and high 
temperature operation capability in frequency 
behaviors can be obtained. 
 
六、結論 
In summary, the effect of NAOR approach 
on the reliability and temperature-dependent 
device characteristics of an InAlAs/InGaAs 
MHEMT are studied and demonstrated. 
Experimentally, it is found that the studied 
device with NAOR approach significantly 
shows better DC and RF characteristics 
including the higher turn-on voltage, higher 
breakdown voltage, higher maximum extrinsic 
transconductance, lower parasitic resistance, 
lower on-resistance, and better microwave 
performance. For accelerated stress, after 373, 
261, 156 hr of stress test, it is found that the 
studied device with NAOR approach 
significantly shows lower degradation rates in 
IDS (10.1, 12.1, 14.5 % ) and gm,max (9.6, 10.7, 
12.2 %) at different temperatures (400, 430, 
460K), respectively. Therefore, the NAOR 
device exhibits improved thermal stability and 
reliability performance over wide temperature 
range. The studied device with these well 
performance shows a promise for high-speed, 
high-temperature, and high-frequency 
electronics applications.
