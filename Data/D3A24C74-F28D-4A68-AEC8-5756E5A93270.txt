2Abstract:
Ambient Power Scheme (APS) converts radio frequencies
or ISM band frequencies to usable electrical power even only in
milliwatts and microwatts range. It is sufficient to operate clocks,
smoke alarms, Ni-Cd battery chargers, &solar cell etc. It also can
provide early seismic warning since earthquake preparation
generates radio frequencies. It also acts as a proximity detector
for huge objects such as ships and vehicles and structures and
small objects build up with RFIDs.
The Ambient Power Scheme (APS) is a simple electronic
circuit which, when connected to antenna and earth ground, will
deliver low voltage up to several milliwatts. The amount of
voltage and power will be determined by local radio noise levels
and antenna dimensions. Especially, the construction as a base
station was widely built for wireless communication in order to
transmit very directly radio frequency signal. To intercept the
ambient radio frequency waves or GHz range waves as a power
source is not just to re-use it to drive the powerless passive
device but also to setup a power channel in wireless way,
so-called wireless power transfer.
The actual circuit consists of two oppositely polarized
voltage doublers. The DC output of each doubler is connected in
series with the other to maximize voltage with using
transformers or not use. Single voltage doublers were often and
widely found in older TV sets for converting 120 VAC to 240
VDC. In the TV circuit the operating frequency is 60 Hz. Now
we need to convert it the miniature version for ISM bands
frequencies in sub-GHz and GHz range.
Some studies for raising the frequencies up to several MHz
were reported as Figure-1. The ambient power module operates
at radio frequencies, receiving most of its power from below
1MHz. The basic circuit may be combined with a variety of
voltage regulation schemes, some of which are shown in Figure
2.
It can be used to power small electronic devices with
CMOS circuitry, like clocks, calculators and RFID or some
smoke alarms detector or low voltage LEDs. This project is
based on the APM circuitry but convert it to integrated circuit
with specific design Schottky diode in up to date CMOS
technology for receiving the power of ISM band frequencies.
Then the power will be converted to drive low power
consumption device such as LED, and RFID. Hence the power
conversion efficiency is the major subject of this project. The
Schottky diode is used in this project is because the important
figure of merit for microwave application. The Schottky diode
can perform the forward bias cutoff frequency up to 10GHz
which is not possible for typical p+/n or n+/p diode in current
widely used CMOS technology for most electronic devices.
Hence to make a clean and reliable and stable Schottky diode
with large amount of contacts without increasing parasitic diode
capacitance is very crucial for the ambient power scheme (APS).
The physics of Schottky diode is extensively discussed in
Sze’s book. Since the most famous IC foundry in Taiwan or rest
of the world did not provide very clear Schottky diode model
and characterization for the circuit designers to adapt it in voltage
regulator circuit. The reason is due to the voltage circuit consume
the silicon area is relatively small. However for the low power
supply and low power consumption circuit do need more
efficiency power regulation in order to not only extend battery
charging cycle but also apply in wireless transponder devices.

II. Experiments:
The so-called silicon Schottky diode is formed as a metal to
silicon junction which needs to generate the good junction
between metal and silicon by using the silicidation process. The
typical Schottky diode process flow in current CMOS
technology is described as Figure-3.
Since the stable Schottky barrier height and forward bias
cutoff frequency are very crucial in this project. In terms of
understanding the Schottky diode characteristics, we design
several types of Schottky diode layouts for extensively studying
the Schottky diode performance as shown in Figuire-4.
Based on the above designed Schottky diode device
structures, we need to have precise device measurement in DC
and RF range for parameters extraction. We will use the
extracted parameters tofit as the Schottky diode SPCIE model
parameters for designing the rectifier circuit as APS schematic
diagram. In order to direct convert the ISM band frequencies, we
combine with the rectifying circuit and filter circuit elements and
transformer and antenna couplers as a schematic diagram for
wireless power conversion circuits shown in Figure-5.
As figure-5 shown, we need to integrate the on chip
