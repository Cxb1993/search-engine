Abstract 
A theoretical model based on Fourier optics and the power-coupling overlap integral is built to 
investigate the inter-channel response in a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) 1xN2 
wavelength-selective switch (WSS). The simulation results demonstrate that the inter-channel 
response depends significantly on the output port location and the radius of curvature of the 
micromirrors. For the output originally aligned with the input along the dispersion direction, 
inter-channel-response suppression can be achieved by rotating the two-dimensional (2D) 
collimator array by a slight angle, e.g. 20°. Experimental results under different conditions are 
also shown. 
This Fourier-optics-based model can also be used to calculate the far-field optical pattern in a 
free-space optical communication system.

摘要 
我們開發了一個以傅氏光學﹝Fourier Optics﹞為理論基礎的模型，以分析 1xN2 波長選擇
切換器的通道間響應﹝Inter-Channel Response﹞。此通道間響應是 WDM 系統中所不希望
見到的，而此模型則證實了該響應與輸出埠位置之間的關聯性，因此我們可藉由調整輸出
埠的位置來予以抑制。將二維輸入/輸出埠陣列旋轉 20 度，原本位於水平位置的輸出埠其
通道間響應之壓抑可達 32.5 dB;此外，通道間響應亦與微鏡片的曲率半徑有關。我們並同
時進行實驗以驗證理論模型之正確性。 
此以傅氏光學為基礎之理論模型，亦可應用於自由空間光通訊中之遠場光場分布的計算。

rotary stage with rotation axis parallel to the optical beams. The center collimator serves as the 
input port. The WDM signals are spatially dispersed by the grating, and focused onto their 
corresponding mirrors by the resolution lens. The two-axis mirrors direct individual wavelengths 
to the desired output ports. The telescope beam expander reduces the optical spot size on the 
MEMS mirror. 
The simulation model can be explained with the assistance of Figure 2. For simplicity, the 
telescope beam expander and the grating are neglected. The field distribution Einput emerging 
from the input fiber collimator contains both amplitude and phase information. It is projected by 
the resolution lens to the back focal plane, where the MEMS mirror array is situated. The 
projected field, denoted by einput, is then spatially modulated by the micromirrors, resulting in a 
modulated field distribution einput’ at the back focal plane. einput’ yields a projected field 
Einput’ at the front focal plane, where the collimators are located. The power-coupling efficiency 
into a specific output fiber collimator is then

field distribution of the output collimator [16]. Note that all the field distributions mentioned 
above are with normalized power, and Eoutput is identical to Einput except for a shift in space if all 
the collimators are identical. Based on Fourier optics [17], Einput’ and Eoutput are the Fourier 
transforms of einput’ and eoutput, respectively, where eoutput is the projected field of the output 
collimator onto the MEMS device plane (i.e. the back focal plane). According to the properties of 
the Fourier transform,

The parameters used for our simulation are the same as those in the experiment. ω0x and ω0y are 
the Gaussian beam radii in the x and y directions, respectively. The beam radius emerging from 
the collimator array is originally 125 μm. It is then expanded to 2 mm after passing through the 
telescope. This leads to a focused spot on the device plane with ω0x and ω0y being 69 μm and 76 
μm, respectively. ω0x and ω0y have different quantities due to the anamorphic effect caused by the 
diffraction grating. The MEMS mirror pitch (i.e. center-to-center distance between adjacent 
mirrors), p, is 200 μm, while the channel spacing f0 is 125 GHz. The spatial dispersion resulting 
from the diffraction grating is explicitly expressed. The term pf/ f0 determines the center location 
of the Gaussian mode, which is a function of the frequency shift f. The output fiber collimator is 
located laterally off the optical axis of the system, resulting in a phase distribution in the 
projected field eoutput and therefore the term [ ]yx sinjkysinjkxexp θ+θ . Given the exact location 
 4
anamorphic effect arising from the grating has been neglected and the radii of the projected 
image on the MEMS device plane are set to be ω0x=ω0y=38μm, different than those used for the 
experiment and the following simulation (ω0x = 69 μm, ω0y = 76 μm). 
In our experiment, MEMS mirrors with curvature and an octagonal shape are used. Therefore, 
the following simulation calculates the power-coupling efficiency vs. frequency shift using such 
mirror conditions. We consider two different mirror curvatures, R = 30 mm and R = 10 mm. For 
each curvature, the output spectra under three rotation angles of the collimator array, 0°, 10°, and 
20°, are simulated. With 0° rotation, the selected output is aligned with input along the horizontal 
direction. Figure 4(a) demonstrates the simulation results for R = 30 mm. The arrows indicate the 
channel centers. When there is no rotation of the collimator array (0°), a pronounced 
inter-channel response at -27.4 dB below the signal (f = 125 GHz) is exhibited. The inter-channel 
response is reduced to -31.3 dB (3.9-dB suppression) and -46.3 dB (18.9-dB suppression) below 
the signal for 10° and 20° rotations, respectively. The results for R = 10 mm are shown in Figure 
4(b).  When the collimator array is not rotated (0°), an inter-channel response at -23 dB below 
the signal is observed. Compared with the case of R = 30 mm, the signal level is decreased to -3.1 
dB due to a larger mirror curvature. The inter-channel response is suppressed to -26.0 dB (3-dB 
suppression) and -33 dB (10-dB suppression) below the signal for 10° and 20° rotations, 
respectively. 
It can be seen that the mirror flatness plays an important role and the larger curvature of R = 10 
mm has reduced the inter-channel-response suppression, especially for 20° rotation. Greater 
curvature also increases the dispersion within the passband. For a perfectly-flat (R = ∞) 
rectangular mirror, the inter-channel response is calculated to be -26.9 dB, -35.1 dB (8.2-dB 
suppression), and -59.4 dB (32.5-dB suppression) below the signal for rotations of 0°, 10°, and 
20°, respectively. 
Most wavelength-selective switches have the ability to attenuate signals. In the free-space 
micromirror-based module, it is done by tuning the mirror angles. For simplicity, we simulate the 
attenuation functionality using the same parameters as those of Figure 3. It is found that the 
inter-channel response varies with the attenuation level. For 0° rotation of the 2D collimator array, 
the inter-channel response between two pass channels with 20-dB attenuation is 5 dB above the 
attenuated passband signal. When the passband attenuation is increased to 40 dB, the 
inter-channel response becomes 28 dB above. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A 1x10 two-axis micromirror array with 200-μm pitch and 98% fill factor is used in the 
experiment [5], as shown in the inset of Figure 1. The mirrors have radii of curvature within the 
range of 10±2 mm. The mechanical scan angles are ±2.63° (at 14.1V) and ±1.27° (at 21.1V) for 
rotation about y and x axes, respectively. The MEMS devices are fabricated using the 
SUMMiT-V surface micromachining process provided by Sandia National Laboratory. In this 
prototype system, a 600-grooves/mm grating is used. The focal length of the resolution lens is 30 
cm. The channel spacing is 125 GHz. It can be adjusted to comply with the 
telecommunication-required 50-GHz or 100-GHz spacing by using an 1100-grooves/mm grating, 
which provides greater dispersion strength and is more commonly used in free-space WDM
