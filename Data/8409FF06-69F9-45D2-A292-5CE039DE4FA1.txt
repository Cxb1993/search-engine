中英文摘要 
在土壤環境中，氣體擴散是控制氣體移動與污染物分布的一個很重要的機制，例如岩層中
自然產生之致癌性氡(radon)氣體在土壤與地下結構建築物中的移動；廢棄物掩埋場甲烷、
二氧化碳氣體與有機揮發氣體的產生與在掩埋場周邊土壤中的移動；土壤根系中氧與二氧
化碳氣體的交換；應用於防治害蟲的殺蟲劑在土壤的分布；與有機揮發性化學物之揮發與
揮發氣體在受污染土壤中之未飽和層的移動等。必須深入了解土壤中氣體擴散傳輸與其影
響反應的過程，才能對上述問題有更深一層的認識與瞭解。傳統的模式建構皆使用 Fick’s 定
理描述氣體在土壤中的擴散分量，並以阻礙係數修正分子擴散係數，以表示氣體在孔隙中
的運動受制於土壤牆的影響。過去的文獻多以實驗推導曲折係數與土壤孔隙率、含水率的
關係，並應用於不同種類的土壤條件。由嚴謹氣體傳輸理論得知，在土壤中，當氣體分子
之自由移動路徑小於孔隙尺寸時，氣體擴散運動由分子擴散主導，土壤曲折係數與孔隙率、
含水率應有相當的關係；但是，當氣體分子之自由移動路徑同等於或小於孔隙尺寸時，氣
體擴散運動亦受 Knudsen 擴散影響，在此情況下，可能造成實驗誤導曲折係數關係式及其
不當的應用。本計畫為延續國科會計畫： NSC 94-2211-E-035-004「未飽和土壤層氣體有效
擴散係數之研究」的第二年建議書。第二年工作主要為繼續進行不同實驗氣體在不同土壤
質地與含水條件的流動與擴散實驗，主要為進行不等分子擴散與等分子擴散的實驗與比較

Gas diffusion is an important mechanism controlling transport processes such as volatilization 
and movement of organic chemicals from polluted soils, distribution of fumigants applied to soil 
for pest control, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide through root zone of soils, movement of 
radon gas in soils and underground concrete structure and emissions of methane, CO2 or organic 
vapors from landfills.  Fick’s law is conventionally employed to represent diffusive flux of a gas 
component in transport models.  In Fick’s law diffusion, the effective gas-phase diffusion 
coefficient is an important factor in predicting the magnitude of gas diffusion in soils.  Therefore, 
it is essential to determine the effective gas-phase diffusion coefficient for accurately predicting 
gas diffusive flux, thereby delineating gas transport and fate processes.  The effective gas-phase 
diffusion coefficient is usually represented by air-filled molecular diffusion coefficient modified 
by air-filled soil porosity and a tortuosity factor to account for the effect of obstruction of soil 
particles on the movement of gas molecules.  In the past, numerous experimental studies 
proposed various relationships of the tortuosity factor in terms of soil porosity, moisture content 
and some empirical constants.  Some of them have also been applied to assess and quantify 
diffusion of different gas components in different soil textures.  However, theoretical 
investigation of multicomponent gas diffusion in porous media shows that gas diffusion in soils

文獻探討 
在土壤等多孔隙的材料中氣體的擴散傳輸機制係有 Dusty-Gas Model(DGM)理論，其描述
氣體在孔隙介質中的擴散機制主要包括分子擴散與 Knudsen 擴散，兩擴散機制同時存在
於傳輸系統，其相對的重要性受到土壤環境條件與被傳輸氣體特性所影響，擴散並可能

計算結果較為接近，而其較 Abu-El-Shar and Abriola (1996)的分析結果高約 2 倍，較
Brugeman(1935) 的分析結果低約 2.5 至 1.3 倍，顯示以 DGM 理論所推得的阻礙係數，到
目前為止仍有很大的歧異。另一方面，至目前為止，純以土壤或改變土壤含水條件的氣
體實驗擴散分析成果很少，故本研究為進行改變土壤含水條件的氣體擴散實驗以分析此
阻礙係數與土壤含水條件的關係。 
除此之外，土壤氣體有效滲透係數亦在 DGM 方程式中有很重要的地位，其亦會影響
Knudsen 擴散的重要程度，尤其在低滲透的土壤系統，這個參數尤其重要，氣體擴散亦可
能受其影響，Ball (1981a)與 Washington et al. (1994)皆注意到土壤氣體滲透係數與氣體擴

傳統上有 Campbell (1974)、Brook-Corey 關係式(Corey, 1994)，可以輔助分析氣體在不同
含水條件流動的有效性，其它如 Ball (1981b)、Ball et al.(1988)曾分析土壤氣體有效滲透係

Eqn (4) can be applied to determine apparent permeability by conducting single gas flow 
experiment in soil column.  Reinecke and Sleep (2002) derived the relationship of ak  with 
gas pressures at soil column ends and gas flow rate in the column, which is

the subscript indicates location 1 and 2, respectively; q2 is the volumetric flux per unit area 
(m/sec) measured at location 2; and L is the soil column length (m).  In Eq. (6), q2, 1p and 2p  
are measured to determined ka.  If a relationship of bi with ke is available, such as Eq. (3), ke 
can further be determined by trial and error for soil with different water saturations.  ke 
represents the multiple of soil intrinsic permeability (k) and relative gas permeability (krg), i.e.,

relative gas permeability, given by

The relationship shown in eqn (12) reveals that experiments for assessing both the obstruction 
factor and the Knudsen diffusion coefficient in the same soil sample are required to investigate 
the dependence of the diffusibility factor on these two parameters.  Obviously, these 
experiments need to be conducted in a low permeability soil sample.   
In a two-component equimolar counter diffusion experiment, data obtained from the 
measurements of component gas fluxes and mole fractions at ends of a soil column can be used 
to determine the term in the parentheses of Eq. (10) or the diffusibility factor in Eq. (11).  The

factor, Qm can be evaluated and compared to the diffusibility factor, Q, to assess the relative 
importance between the molecular and Knudsen diffusions of the experimental soils at different 
water saturations. 
 
Experimental Methods 
Two types of experiments were conducted in this study:  single gas flow and binary diffusion 
experiments.  Single gas flow experiments were conducted with a pure gas flowing through 
the sample under an imposed pressure gradient to estimate permeability and Knudsen diffusion 
coefficient, i.e., Eqns (2), (3), (5) and (6). Binary diffusion experiments were carried out under 
isobaric conditions with a pair of gases to estimate the diffusibility and obstruction factors, 
given by Eqns (13).  These two types of experiments were all conducted in a system with 
some parts switched off or on for different type of experiments.   The experimental system is 
schematically illustrated in Fig. 6 
The experimental system is based on the design by Abu-El-Sha’r and Abriola (1997) and consists of the 
following components: a cylindrical sample holder; two compressed gas sources; a differential pressure 
transmitter (Huba Control, range 0-50 mbar, accuracy ±0.05% of total scale) to measure the pressure 
difference across a soil sample in the sample holder; flowmeters to measure gas flow rates from the soil 
sample; humidifying systems to presaturate gas stream with water vapor before it enters the sample 
holder; humidity senors (electronic, range 20-95%RH) to monitor humidity of gas stream at both sides 
of the soil sample; a desaturation system, which consists of a vacuum pump (Gast) and a pore water 
collection vessel, to desaturate soil in the sample holder; pressure transmitters (Huba Control, range 
-1-+3 bar ) to measure pressures at both sides of the soil sample; a pressurization system to produce 
confining pressure on the soil sample.  These various components connected to each other by stainless 
steel, Teflon or silicone tubing (1/4”) with stainless steel tube fittings and 2-(or 3-) way switching valves 
(Fujikin). 
 
 
 
 
The cylindrical sample holder is based on the design by Reinecke and Sleep (2002).  A detailed cross 
section of the holder is shown in Fig. 7.  The main components of the sample holder are an acrylic 
cylinder (9.6 cm internal diameter, 18 cm length), two acrylic endcaps, a ceramic cylinder (20 cm height, 
3 cm outer diameter) supported by an acrylic core, and a flexible latex membrane (0.2 cm thickness) on 
the inside wall of the acrylic cylinder.  In the sample holder, soil occupies the annular space of the 
acrylic cylinder between the ceramic cylinder and the membrane.  On each end of the acrylic cylinder, 
an acrylic ring (0.6 cm height, 9 cm internal diameter) fitted into the cylinder was placed to fix the 
membrane.  A stainless steel screen was then placed to support the soil in the cylinder.  Between the 
screen and the soil, filter paper (Whatman 4, pore size 20-25μm) was placed to prevent the soil from 
clogging the screen.  The acrylic cylinder, ceramic cylinder and core were attached to the endcap 
sealed with O-rings.    A circular groove distributes gas around the perimeter of the endcap.  The 
ceramic cylinder allows water flowing through and into the annular space between the ceramic and the 
acrylic core, when the soil sample is desaturated by the desaturation system.  The latex membrane 
supports confining pressure, which is produced by an air compressor.  The confining pressure presses 
the membrane against the outer circumference of the soil, and also presses the soil against the ceramic 
cylinder, thus preventing short circuiting of gas flow around the sample.  A constant pressure 
difference of approximately 60 cmHg, which is measured by a mercury manometer, is maintained 
between the soil gas pressure and the confining pressure.   
To minimize the evaporation of pore water from the soil during the experiment, the gas delivered from a 
compressed gas tank (40 L) and regulated by a pressure regulator (0~2kg/cm2) was directed through the 
humidifying system before entering the sample holder. The humidifying system consists of an acrylic 
column (30 cm height, 4 cm diameter) filled with plastic media (4? mm diameter).  A gear pump was 
operated to supply water to the column.   
Gas flow rate was measured at the gas outlet with a soap-film flowmeter.  An UltrafloR electronic 
calibrator (SKC, accuracy ±0. 5% of reading) was used for large flows ranging from 1-6000 mL/min.  
Small flows ranging from 0.05-3 mL/min were measured with a 0.5 mL capillary column bubble 
flowmeter (Supelco).  
For binary diffusion experiment, gas samples were taken with 2 mL gas sampling syringes 
(Supelco) through a septum port located at the gas outlet line.  Mole fractions of the diffusing 
gas, here is CO, in nitrogen were measured using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2010) 
equipped with a methanizer (Shimadzu, MTN-1) and a flame ionization detector (FID) with a 
molecular sieve 5A GC PLOT Capillary Column (Supelco products).  The methanizer reduces 
the CO component into CH4 using nickel catalyzer and the CH4 concentration is then analyzed 
by the GC/FID. 
The investigated porous media was silica flour (Gingin, B205) due to its low intrinsic 
permeability (<10-14 m2).  Similar material has also been used in the experimental work 
conducted by Reinecke and Sleep (2002) for assessinf the Knudsen diffusion coefficient.  The 
particle size distribution of the silica flour were analyzed by the vendor (Gingin Industrial sand 
Company, Taiwan), which is very similar to that presented by Reinecke and Sleep (2002).  
Particle density is also provided by Gingin and is about 2.65 g/cm3.

that the total amount of dry packed soil in the sample holder is less than the wet packed soil 
amount (excluding water amount) for about 100g, resulting in greater porosities in dry packing 
than in wet packing.

a Total porosity of the soil sample 
b The coefficient of multiple determination for linear regression  
 
Each wet packed soil samples was desaturated and then rewetted to different saturation levels 
for single gas flow and binary diffusion experiments, except for the first desaturated sample 
(Wet 1), for which only gas flow experiments were conducted.  For each wet soil sample 
starting from over-saturated conditions (the added soil and distilled water amounts were 
recorded), the maximum saturation level (Sm) was determined by measuring the difference of 
total weights of the sample holder (including the wet soil) before and after gravitational 
 18
Single gas flow experiments were conducted for dry and partially saturated silica flour systems 
to determine apparent and effective permeabilities and Knudsen diffusion coefficient based on 
Eqs (2), (3), (5) and (6).  Figure 8 presents the measurements and the regression lines for 
determining apparent permeability based on Eq. (6) for the second wet packed sample (Wet 2).  
Table 1 summarizes the permeability values and the corresponding Knudsen diffusion 
coefficient for each dry and different saturated soil sample.  A good fitting is presented for the 
linear relationship of the flow rate and pressure gradient with the R2 (the coefficient of multiple 
determination) values all greater than 0.95.  Effective permeability is calculated by trial and 
error based on Eqs. (3) and (5) (adjusted for nitrogen using air and nitrogen molecular weights 
and viscosities).  Then the Knudsen diffusion coefficient is determined by Eq. (2).  Here the 
experimentally derived correlation of the Klinkenberg parameter with effective permeability 
presented by Reinecke and Sleep (2002) is utilized.  If the Heid et al. (1950) correlation of the 
Klinkenberg parameter is used, a greater Knudsen diffusion coefficient value can be obtained 
for the silica flour system.   
Intrinsic permeability for each wet packed soil sample is determined by trial and error 
according to the best fit curve of the Brooks-Corey relationship of the gas relative permeability 
with water saturation, i.e., Eq. (7).  Figure 9 shows the experimental values of krg as a function 
of Sw for the second wet packed soil with a Sm value of 84.4% and a plot of the Brooks-Corey 
relationship with best fit values of 2.09×10-14, 36% and 4.36 for k, Swr andλ, respectively, in 
which the Swr andλ values are exactly the same as those obtained by Reinecke and Sleep 
(2002).  Due to the wet packed soil amount (excluding water amount) different from dry 
packing, Table 1 shows that the intrinsic permeability (k) value of the dry packed sample is one 
order of magnitude greater than wet packing.   
For the wet silica flour sample, the effective permeability (ke) values are one to two orders of 
magnitude less than the intrinsic permeability values and consistent with the measured results 
presented by Reinecke and Sleep (2002).  The magnitudes of Knudsen diffusion coefficient 
obtained in this study are in a range between 5.3 ×10-6 and 5.3×10-7 m2/sec for the silica flour 
systems at water saturation ranging from 53% to 75%.  The Knudsen diffusion coefficient 
value for the dry silica flour is also one order greater than the wet soil at 53% water saturation.  
Overall, the magnitude of the Knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained in this study is similar to 
the result presented by Reinecke and Sleep (2002).

Fig. 9 the relationship of effective gas permeability with water saturation 
 
Binary diffusion experiments 
Binary diffusion experiments were carried out for partially saturated soil systems under isobaric 
condition.  Steady-state gas flow rate and mole fraction of CO measured at the side of the 
sample holder where nitrogen gas passed are used to calculate diffusive flux of CO and the 
obstruction factor based on Eq. (13) for the unsaturated soil sample.  Table 2 shows the 
measured results for the wet packed samples (Wet 1 to Wet 3) at different water saturations.  
Both of the N2 and CO gas flow rates were controlled to be about 100 cm3/min.  Steady-state 
gas flow rates at two sides of the sample holder are within 1% difference.  The mole fraction 
value of CO shown in table 2 is average of six measurements obtained from diffusion 
experiment when steady state is reached.  Table 2 also shows the 95% confidence interval (CI) 
of the measured mole fraction value of CO as a percentage of the corresponding averaged mole 
fraction value, which is less than 7% of the averaged XiL.  The confidence interval is 
determined using the Student’s t distribution.   
The obstruction factor can be assessed by Eq. (13) for the soil sample at different water 
saturations.  The Knudsen diffusion coefficient value for CO is the same as that for N2 due to 
the same molecular weight and viscosity of these two gas components.   Due to air 
temperature varying from 25.8 to 29  ℃ at 1 atm, the free air binary molecular diffusion 
coefficient for the gas pair N2/CO, 0

D − , may vary from 2.45×10
-5 ~ 2.49×10-5 m2/sec, 
which is estimated according to the Chapman-Enskog equation (Reid et al., 1988).  Here a 
constant 0

D − value (2.45×10
-5 m2/sec) is used in the calculation.  The obstruction factor

flour at various water saturation levels 
 
The diffusibility factor can also be obtained based on Fick’s law, which is in magnitude about 
the same as the obstruction factor with less than 5% difference.  It also shows that the 
diffusibility factor value is a little less than the obstruction factor value due to different 
theoretical base for these two factors and their difference does not tend to increase as soil water 
saturation increases for the wet silica flour system. Figure 11 shows the relationship of the 
obstruction factor with air-filled porosity obtained for the partially saturated silica flour, which 
is also compared to the results obtained with the diffusibility correlations presented by 
Millington and Quirk (1961) and Moldrup et al. (2000b).  The obstruction factor values, which 
are obtained from the first wet packed soil (Wet 1) at water saturation less than 70%, deviates 
significantly from the others. However, if these data points are excluded from linear regression 
analysis, a good fit curve for Qm in terms of air-filled porosity (θg) can be obtained with the 
regression coefficient, R2, greater than 0.95.   
For silica flour with intrinsic permeability at the order of 10-14 m2, this study shows that the 
diffusibility factor in magnitude is almost identical to the obstruction factor under mid to high 
water saturation conditions (53% to 75%) and less than the results obtained with the 
correlations presented in literature.  Therefore, it conflicts with the result presented in figure 3, 
which is obtained based on the Millington and Quirk’s correlation of the obstruction factor to 
modify the binary molecular diffusion coefficient.  This implies that previous correlations may 
not be applied to estimate the diffusibility factor for soil intrinsic permeability at the order of 
10-14 m2 at partial saturation.  The regression relationship obtained in this study is further used 
to recalculate the difference of the diffusibility and the obstruction factor for soil intrinsic 
permeability equal to or less than 10-14 m2 as shown in figure 3.  It shows that the difference is

ABSTRACT  
 
This paper presents an assessment of soil gas distributions, aerobic biodegradation and volatilization rates of 
organic compounds in soils based on a model formulated by the Dusty Gas Model (DGM) theory and field data 
sets obtained from literature.  The DGM predictions are further compared to the results based on Fick’s law of 
diffusion.  Results show that, if a model employing Fick’s law is calibrated to oxygen gas concentration 
measurements, both the calibrated degradation rate and predicted volatilization rate of organic vapour are different 
from the DGM results.   
 
Key words: Dusty Gas Model, biodegradation rate, volatilization rate, unsaturated soil 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Aerobic biodegradation and volatilization near the contaminated groundwater 
table and the free product zone constitute a coupled pathway that contributes 
significantly to the natural attenuation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at 
contaminant-spilled sites.  For the past few years, research has been undertaken on 
evaluating the rates of biodegradation, volatilization and the biodegradation kinetics 
of organic vapours in unsaturated soils by calibrating numerical or analytic models to 
gas composition data.  Most of the applied models, however, are based on Fick’s 
law of diffusion for gaseous phase transport and assume that the gaseous phase 
advection is negligibly small.  Recent research has indicated that the Dusty Gas 
Model (DGM) theory can provide a more rigorous way to assess multicomponent gas 
transport in porous media, since both diffusive and advective gas transports can be 
induced due to nonequimolarity of gas mixtures composed of organic vapors and 
atmospheric gases and can not be simply described by Fick’s law of diffusion (Sleep, 
1998; Fen and Abriola, 2004; Altevogt and Jaffe, 2005).  .

The simulator developed by Fen and Abriola (2004) is modified to simulate one-dimensional gas 
phase flow and multicomponent gas transport under aerobic biodegradation of organic compounds.  The 
following assumptions are made: (1) water and immiscible phases are immobile and liquid phase diffusion 
is negligibly small in comparison with gas phase diffusion; (2) composition of gas mixture is fixed at 
boundaries; (3) gas phase flow and transport is at steady state and gas phase pressure variations due to 
temporal fluctuation of atmospheric pressure is neglected; (4) water moisture and air-phase contents are 
invariable in time.  Based upon these assumptions, species molar balance equation in terms of gas phase 
molar concentration can be written as:   
ˆ              1 2Ti iN R i , ,....,n∇ ⋅ = =           (1) 
where n is the total number of gas components, including atmospheric gases and organic vapours, in the 
gas mixture, TiNˆ  is the gas phase total molar flux vector of component i (mol/m
2 sec) including total 
diffusive ( DiNˆ ) and viscous (
v
iNˆ ) flux components, and Ri is the source term of component i (mol/m
3 
sec). 
 
The component viscous flux is typically given by a Darcy’s law expression with assuming ideal gas 
law.  The component total diffusive flux can be defined as either the DGM equations or Fick’s law of 
diffusion.  These flux component expressions are listed in Table 1 in which surface and temperature 
diffusions are not considered for the diffusive flux component.  Besides, in this study, oijD and
K
iD are 
calculated based on Fuller, Schettler and Giddings method (Reid et al, 1989) and the Klinkenberg 
relationship (Thorstenson and Pollock, 1989), respectively.  oFiD  is calculated as the binary molecular 
diffusion coefficient of gas i and nitrogen.  Qm is evaluated according to Millington and Quirk’s 
relationship (Sleep, 1998).  Tortuosity, τ, shown in Fick’s law of diffusion, is commonly expressed in 
terms of soil porosity and gas-filled porosity (see, e.g., Millington and Quirk (1961), Lai et al. (1976)); 
thus, the component total diffusive flux based on Fick’s law does not account for the Knudsen effect.  A 
modified definition of gas phase tortuosity, suggested by Fen and Abriola (2004) and shown in Table 1, is 
applied here to reduce discrepancies between predictions of the DGM and those based on Fick’s law of 
diffusion for gas transport in low permeability media.  It is also noted that the nonequimolar flux 
component ( Di NX ˆ ) is not considered for Fick’s law of diffusion. 
 
In addition to organic components, two primary atmospheric gases, i.e., O2 and nitrogen (N2), are 
considered in model simulations.  CO2 is also considered if organic compounds are aerobically 
biodegraded in a simulated system.  For organic vapour balance equation, the corresponding source term 
is represented by aerobic biodegradation rate, which is defined by Monod type reactions; thus, the 
corresponding source term in O2 and CO2 balance equations, representative of consumption rate of O2 and 
production rate of CO2, respectively, due to aerobic biodegradation of organic compounds, is proportional 
to degradation rate of organic compound by assuming reaction stoichiometry.  Other soil gases, i.e., 
 42
and iteration methods used for solving these equations are referred to Fen and Abriola (2004). 
 
1.2. Simulation cases 
 
Simulations are performed to determine aerobic biodegradation and volatilization rates of organic 
compounds through model calibration to soil gas concentration data under the condition of constant mole 
fractions of organic vapours at boundaries.  The contamination scenarios investigated by Ostendorf and 
Kampbell (1991) and Ostendorf et al. (2000) are simulated in this study.  Field conditions of these 
scenarios are summarized in Table 2.  The modeled domain is a vertical 1-D soil column, in which total 
hydrocarbon (THC) and/or TCE vapours migrate from their dissolved phases located at the column bottom.  
The bottom and top boundaries of the domain are water table (or top of capillary fringe) and ground 
surface, respectively.  Type 1 boundary conditions are assigned to these boundaries and specify measured 
concentrations values of gas components.  Monod-type reaction is used for the simulation of 
contamination scenario presented in Ostendorf and Kampbell (1991).  The same sets of reaction 
constants are used for both the DGM and Fick’s law predictions.

the top or bottom of the soil column can represent rates of O2 consumption and CO2 production, 
respectively, due to aerobic biodegradation of organic compounds in the unsaturated zone or in the 
capillary fringe.  In this comparison, e1 and e2 both represent the percentage differences in predicted 
component flux rates at the bottom or top boundary at steady state: the first one compares the DGM 
predictions with the predictions based on Fick’s law; the second one compares the DGM predictions with 
the Fick’s law predictions made with the simulator without considering gas advection.  Results show that 
the component flux rates predicted by different diffusive flux expressions are almost identical under the 
scenario of no reaction in the unsaturated zone, i.e., the case studied in Ostendorf et al. (2000), for every 
gas component.  For the scenario of reactions in the unsaturated zone, the difference between the organic 
vapour flux rates is also minimal, but the difference is 9% for the O2 results, i.e., Fick’s law overpredicts 
consumption rate of O2.  On the other hand, the Fick’s law predictions made with the simulator without 
considering advection are distinct from the DGM results, i.e., Fick’s law underpredicts volatilization rate 
of THC by 2.6% and overpredicts consumption rate of O2 by 6%.  This again reveals that it can be 
improper to assess volatilization rates of organic compounds through model calibration to O2 gas 
concentration data based on Fick’s law, especially for contaminated sites with aerobic biodegradation of 
organic vapours in unsaturated soils. 
 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Under the scenario of aerobic biodegradation of organic vapours in unsaturated soils, Fick’s law can 
give more errors in transport predictions of oxygen gas than the errors for organic components; thus, a 
Fickian-based model can erroneously assess degradation and volatilization rates of contaminants in soils, 
if it is calibrated to oxygen gas data.  The error can also be substantial, if gas advection is not considered.

QUANTIFICATION OF BIODEGRADATION AND VOLATILIZATION
RATES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN SOILS BY USING THE DUSTY

ABSTRACT
This paper presents an assessment of soil gas distributions, aerobic biodegradation and volatilization rates of organic
compounds in soils based on a model formulated by the Dusty Gas Model (DGM) theory and field data sets obtained
from literature. The DGM predictions are further compared to the results based on Fick’s law of diffusion. Results
show that, if a model employing Fick’s law is calibrated to oxygen gas concentration measurements, both the
calibrated degradation rate and predicted volatilization rate of organic vapour are different from the DGM results.
Key words: Dusty Gas Model, biodegradation rate, volatilization rate, unsaturated soil
1. INTRODUCTION
Aerobic biodegradation and volatilization near the contaminated groundwater table and the
free product zone constitute a coupled pathway that contributes significantly to the natural
attenuation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at contaminant-spilled sites. For the past
few years, research has been undertaken on evaluating the rates of biodegradation,
volatilization and the biodegradation kinetics of organic vapours in unsaturated soils by
calibrating numerical or analytic models to gas composition data. Most of the applied models,
however, are based on Fick’s law of diffusion for gaseous phase transport and assume that the
gaseous phase advection is negligibly small. Recent research has indicated that the Dusty
Gas Model (DGM) theory can provide a more rigorous way to assess multicomponent gas
transport in porous media, since both diffusive and advective gas transports can be induced due
to nonequimolarity of gas mixtures composed of organic vapors and atmospheric gases and
can not be simply described by Fick’s law of diffusion (Sleep, 1998; Fen and Abriola, 2004;
Altevogt and Jaffe, 2005). .
For simulating gas phase flow and transport under aerobic biodegradation and volatilization of
VOCs, a contaminant reaction stoichiometric relationship is usually assumed to solve the
coupled organic vapors, oxygen (O2) and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) gas reactive transport
phase flow and transport is at steady state and gas phase pressure variations due to temporal fluctuation of
atmospheric pressure is neglected; (4) water moisture and air-phase contents are invariable in time. Based
upon these assumptions, species molar balance equation in terms of gas phase molar concentration can be
written as:
ˆ 1 2Ti iN R i , ,....,n   (1)
where n is the total number of gas components, including atmospheric gases and organic vapours, in the gas
mixture, TiNˆ is the gas phase total molar flux vector of component i (mol/m
2 sec) including total diffusive
( DiNˆ ) and viscous (
v
iNˆ ) flux components, and Ri is the source term of component i (mol/m
3 sec).
The componentviscous flux is typicaly given by a Darcy’s law expression with assuming ideal gas law.
The component total diffusive flux can be defined as either the DGM equations or Fick’s law of difusion.  
These flux component expressions are listed in Table 1 in which surface and temperature diffusions are not
considered for the diffusive flux component. Besides, in this study, oijD and
K
iD are calculated based on
Fuller, Schettler and Giddings method (Reid et al, 1989) and the Klinkenberg relationship (Thorstenson and
Pollock, 1989), respectively. oFiD is calculated as the binary molecular diffusion coefficient of gas i and
nitrogen. Qm is evaluated according to Milington and Quirk’s relationship(Sleep, 1998). Tortuosity, τ,
shown in Fick’s law of diffusion, is commonly expressed in terms of soil porosity and gas-filled porosity (see,
e.g., Millington and Quirk (1961), Lai et al. (1976)); thus, the component total diffusive flux based onFick’s 
law does not account for the Knudsen effect. A modified definition of gas phase tortuosity, suggested by
Fen and Abriola (2004) and shown in Table 1, is applied here to reduce discrepancies between predictions of
the DGM and those based on Fick’s law of diffusion for gas transport in low permeability media. It is also
noted that the nonequimolar flux component ( Di NX ˆ ) is not considered for Fick’s law of diffusion.
In addition to organic components, two primary atmospheric gases, i.e., O2 and nitrogen (N2), are
considered in model simulations. CO2 is also considered if organic compounds are aerobically biodegraded
in a simulated system. For organic vapour balance equation, the corresponding source term is represented
by aerobic biodegradation rate, which is defined by Monod type reactions; thus, the corresponding source
term in O2 and CO2 balance equations, representative of consumption rate of O2 and production rate of CO2,
respectively, due to aerobic biodegradation of organic compounds, is proportional to degradation rate of
organic compound by assuming reaction stoichiometry. Other soil gases, i.e., nitrogen and water vapour,
are assumed to be inert in the gas mixture.

(THC) and/or TCE vapours migrate from their dissolved phases located at the column bottom. The bottom
and top boundaries of the domain are water table (or top of capillary fringe) and ground surface, respectively.
Type 1 boundary conditions are assigned to these boundaries and specify measured concentrations values of
gas components. Monod-type reaction is used for the simulation of contamination scenario presented in
Ostendorf and Kampbell (1991). The same sets of reaction constants are used for both the DGM and Fick’s
law predictions.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
According to the findings of Ostendorf et al. (2000), at steady state, aerobic biodegradation of organic
vapours in an unsaturated soil zone can impart a convex shape to O2 concentration profile in the zone.
However, no reaction of organic vapors in the zone may impart a concave shape to O2 profile in the zone.
Figure 1 shows the steady-state gas concentration profiles predicted by DGM for the cases studied in
Ostendorf and Kampbell (1991) and Ostendorf et al. (2000), which correspond to the scenarios of reactions
and no reaction of organic vapours in an unsaturated soil zone, respectively. Basically, due to small organic
fractions in the gas mixture for the simulated scenarios, deviations between the organic gas concentration
profiles predicted by the DGM and those predicted by Fick’s law are indistinguishable. However, for the
contaminated sites with aerobic biodegradation of organic vapours in unsaturated soils.
4. CONCLUSIONS
Under the scenario of aerobic biodegradation of organic vapours in unsaturated soils, Fick’s law can give
more errors in transport predictions of oxygen gas than the errors for organic components; thus, a
Fickian-based model can erroneously assess degradation and volatilization rates of contaminants in soils, if it
is calibrated to oxygen gas data. The error can also be substantial, if gas advection is not considered.
