1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Microelectronics has led to many developments in bio-applications 
and their miniaturization has greatly impacted bio-systems. Micro and 
nano levels of interaction in bio-systems have opened up a new field of 
research and new products. In microfluidics, fluids flow in microchannels 
with very little dead volume which eliminates contamination and mixing 
among the fluids (Erickson and Li 2004; Jang et al. 2007). Microfluidic 
devices offer shorter reaction times, smaller fluid sample/reagent volumes, 
and parallel processes which are used in many fields, including industrial 
gas and liquid control, bio-medical instruments, semiconductor processes, 
and automotive applications (Nguyen et al. 1988; Jang and Wang 2007; 
Elwenspoek et al. 1994). Various components for microfluidics have 
been fabricated, including channels, passive and active valves, actuators 
for active valves and pumps, flow sensors, reaction chambers, filters, and 
mixers (Gravesen et al. 1993; Jang and Kan 2007). Channels and 
reservoirs are required to process the fluid. Microfluidic systems can also 
control small volumes of fluids to perform highly sensitive and high 
throughput operations in chemical and biological experiments. 
Microfluidic structures can be formed on silicon/polymer substrates using 
micromachining, CMOS MEMS technology, or the micro stamping 
method. The convergence of microfluidics and microelectronics has 
resulted in a new kind of device, microfluidic chips. For instance, 
embedded fluidic channels with cross section of a few μm can be created 
to direct fluids in CMOS devices. Peng et al. fabricated a size comparable 
to a CMOS sensor die with interconnected multilevel microchannel 
hydrophobicity of PDMS, the surface strongly interacts with apolar 
analytes or species containing apolar domains, resulting in significant 
uncontrolled adsorption on channel walls (Linder et al. 2001). It is known 
that PDMS is impermeable to liquid water but permeable to gasses and 
nonpolar organic solvents (Saarela et al. 2006). As the sealing for native 
PDMS is reversible and could not withstand high flow pressure, leakage 
between two slabs could be caused when vacuum is applied to one end of 
PDMS microchannels (Xu et al. 2008). Although there are some 
limitations from using PDMS material for biological applications that can 
potentially hinder it utility, PDMS has several advantages, such as low 
cost, simple fabrication, flexibility, excellent water permeability, and 
amenability to micro-molding (Folch et al. 1998; Charati and Stern 1998). 
In addition, its material compatibility based on biological and chemical 
stability is good, which is the key parameter in the package development 
(S C Chong et al. 2005). Therefore, PDMS is used as the substrate 
material for package in this study. 
Despite the many advantages of using a PDMS substrate, depositing 
metal layers on its surface is challenging. A thin metal film can be 
deposited on compliant substrates with compressive stress which causes 
the film to buckle. For instance, compressive stress in gold films induces 
spontaneous wrinkling, which can shrink the net length of the thin-film 
conductors by several tenths of a percent (Bowden et al. 1998). Complex 
wave structures of thin films on compliant substrates have been 
investigated by several research groups (Kim et al. 2001; Huang and Suo 
2002). Ste´phanie Pe´richon Lacoura et al. fabricated stripes of thin gold 
films with widths of 250 μm on a PDMS substrate with built-in 
x 0.5mm, were used in this study. A sensor was inserted into the bottom 
PDMS substrate. The top and bottom PDMS substrates were then bonded 
together using an oxygen plasma treatment.  
CMOS MEMS 2P4M 0.35 μm fabrication was adapted to fabricate 
the impedance sensor shown in Fig. 1. Dual microchannels and four sets 
of micro-structures were fabricated in one chip. The VIA (tungsten) was 
deposited on the end of aluminum electrodes. The microchannel was 
225μm wide and the electrodes were 8μm wide. The electrodes in the 
microchannel were protected by Metal2 except for the measurement area. 
The electrodes outside the microchannel were deposited under the 
protection layer. The impedance measurement was taken at low voltage 
(0.05 V ~ 1 V) and low current (about 1 μA). The protection layer of 
Metal3 and Metal4 shielded the device to prevent the electrodes and 
circuit of the chips from damage during post MEMS fabrication. 
photolithography process. The depth of the microchannels was 24μm. 
The impedance sensor chip was placed in the bottom PDMS substrate. To 
create room for the chip in the bottom PDMS substrate, two materials 
were considered for fabricating the PDMS mold: PCB boards and glass. 
PCB boards are easily etched, but the accuracy is not good enough to put 
the CMOS MEMS chips right into the hole without a vacant space. Glass 
can be used for the mold of PDMS. However, the chips fabricated using 
the CMOS MEMS process are about 500μm tall. It is difficult to etch 
glass to a depth of 500μm using dry and wet etching. Wet etching on 
glass causes side effects which are not good for the chip. Therefore, an 
impedance sensor chip was sacrificed and glued on glass as the mold of 
the bottom PDMS substrate.   
 
100Å, 200Å and 250Å, respectively. The cooling time between each 
phase was 25 minutes. Figure 5 shows the fabricated gold electrode.

technique used, the cleanliness of the bonding surfaces, the ratio of 
PDMS base to cross-linking agent, and the curing/baking process. The 
bonding strength was determined by gas pressure. In this study, the 
package bonding strength of oxygen plasma was determined by tensile 
testing and liquid injection testing. The experiments were performed to 
determine the reliability of the PDMS package.

3-2 Electrode testing based on impedance 
measurements 
The electrodes on the PDMS substrates allow the CMOS MEMS 
chip to communicate with the measurement instrument (Precision 
Impedance Analyzers, Kayne Kerr Inc., 6440B). An alternative current 
voltage with 0.5V magnitude was used in the measurements and the 
measurements were carried out at frequency range between 1000 Hz to 
100 kHz. To verify the attachment of electrodes between top and bottom 
PDMS substrates, the short circuit test was performed. The amplitude of 
impedance is as small as that of a short circuit. The phase of impedance 
was close to 0 degrees during the short circuits condition. This 
experiment demonstrates that the electrodes between the bottom and top 
PDMS substrates have a good connection. Figure 7 shows the 
measurements of open (air), DI water, and PBS. The impedance 
magnitude of air was up to 80 MΩ , which approaches the open circuit 
condition. The impedance magnitude of PBS was several kΩ . Figure 8 
shows the impedance magnitude and phase of PBS at various 
concentrations: 1M, 2×10-4M, 1×10-4M, and 6.7×10-5M. The 
measurement results demonstrate that the fabricated electrodes on PDMS 
can differentiate various samples.
