Abstract 
 
An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach accounting for inter-particle collision, based on a RANS 
turbulence model (low-Reynolds-number non-linear k-εmodel developed by Abe et al., 2003) 
for the carries fluid and a stochastic Lagrangian model for particles, is developed in this 
three-year project. The stochastic Lagrangian modeling work follows basically the direct 
simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The results obtained with the deterministic method 
in a fully developed channel flow at Re 644t =  laden with various kinds of particles are used 
to validate the developed stochastic method. It is shown that the developed stochastic model of 
inter-particle collisions can perform as well as the deterministic model does but save 
computational expenditure remarkably. The study shows that the p ct t is an appropriate 
parameter indicating the significance of inter-particle collisions. Here pt and ct are the 
particle response time and mean free time, respectively. A binary-mixture particle-laden flow 
is used to investigate the polydispersed effects of inter-particle collisions.

Introduction 
 
1.1 Background 
Gas-particle flows considered in this work are gaseous flows laden with solid particles. 
Gas-particle flows are frequently encountered in engineering applications, such as powder 
classifiers, powder mixing devices, fluidized bed combustors, pneumatic transport, 
solid-rocket plumes, particle coating, powder drying, etc. Gas-particle flows also appear 
widely in nature, such as pollution diffusion, dust storms, mudflows, etc. An important 
physical process in gas-particle flows is inter-particle collisions, which makes the entire 
problem complicated and difficult to be revolved while the number of particles becomes huge. 
The development of efficient approaches with considering inter-particle collisions can help us 
improve the design of engineering devices regarding with gas-particle flows via numerical 
simulations. 
Depending on the frequency of inter-particle collisions, gas-particle flows can be 
classified into several categories. Based on the classification defined by Crowe et al. (1996), 
the particle motion is controlled by the surface and the body forces on the particle in a dilute 
flow. In a dense flow, the particle motion is controlled primarily by the inter-particle 
interaction. Tsuji (2000) further classified particle-laden flows into three categories, in the 
view of the extent of inter-particle interaction, as follows. 
(1) Collision-free flows (dilute cases). 
(2) Collision-dominated flows (non-dense cases). 
(3) Contact-dominated flows (dense cases). 
Sommerfeld (2001) suggested the following quantitative criterion to distinguish the dilute and 
the dense regions of particle-laden flows:

/  1, dense case (collision-dominated)

where pt  and ct  are the particle relaxation time and the mean free time between collisions, 
respectively. Based on the above criterion, the importance of inter-particle collisions is not 
merely dependent on the particle number density of particle-laden flows since ct  is a

The other approach in modeling inter-particle collisions is the stochastic method in 
which the collisions are treated probabilistically. Computations of collision-dominated flows 
using the stochastic collision models are cost effective. The Tsuji/Tanaka group (1993, 1995, 
& 1996) applied the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which was originally 
developed for the study of molecular dynamics by Bird (1994), to the studies of cluster 
formation and the flow instability induced by particles in the gas-particle laminar flows. 
Currently, Sommerfeld (2001) developed a stochastic inter-particle collision model, which 
relies on the generation of a fictitious collision partner and accounts for a possible correlation 
of the velocities of colliding particles in turbulent flows. Sommerfeld (2001) validated his 
stochastic inter-particle collision model in the particle-laden, homogeneous, isotropic 
turbulence. Later, Lain et al. (2002) applied this stochastic inter-particle collision model to the 
computation of a turbulent particle-laden channel flow using the second-moment closure 
model. Since the stochastic inter-particle collision model does not require the detection of 
possible collision partners near the considered particle as does the deterministic method, they 
claimed that the use of this stochastic model is economic with regard to the computer time. 
However, the stochastic model developed by Sommerfeld is limited to the cases of the inertia 
particles with sizes larger than the dissipation scale of turbulence. More information on the 
review of the numerical studies of particle-laden flows in the past can be found in the current 
paper of Sommerfeld (2003). 
In the dilute and the non-dense cases of turbulent particle-laden flows, the interaction 
between the fluctuating motion of the carrier fluid and the dispersed particles have to be taken 
into the consideration in the physical modeling in addition to the complicated turbulence 
phenomena of the carrier fluid. The interaction between turbulence and particles are twofold. 
One is the turbulence dispersion of the particles, that is, the effects of turbulence on the 
particles. The other is the modulation of the fluid turbulence due to the particles, that is, the 
effects of the presence of particles on the turbulence structure. At the very low volume fraction 
and mass loading, the carrier fluid is almost not affected by the presence of particles and only 
the particles are affected by the fluid turbulence. This region is termed as ‘one-way’ coupling. 
In the second region, the volume fraction of the dispersed particles is still low due to the small 
particle size while the mass loadings attributable to the high particle density are large enough 
to alter significantly the carrier flow turbulence. Therefore, there appears ‘two-way’ coupling.

categories of turbulence models to determine the Reynolds stresses in the RANS approach. It 
includes, from simple to complex extent, mixing-length models, one-equation models, linear 
eddy-viscosity models, nonlinear eddy-viscosity models, explicit algebraic Reynolds stress 
models, implicit algebraic Reynolds stress models, and differential Reynolds stress models. 
The modern RANS approach can well simulate complex flows such as developing and 
circulating ones. Especially the recently developed nonlinear eddy-viscosity models process 
both high accuracy and computational efficiency in the calculation of turbulent flows. One 
drawback of applying RANS approach in particle-laden flows is that only mean flow 
quantities of the carrier fluid are determined. It requires a model to generate the instantaneous 
fluctuating velocity of the carrier fluid along a particle trajectory. The accuracy of the 
generated fluctuations certainly influences the subsequent evaluation of fluid-particle 
interaction. However, RANS approach is still the most acceptable means in application to the 
turbulent flows of engineering practices due to the consideration of computational economy 
and accuracy. 
 
1.2 Motivation and Objectives 
A new approach using available RANS turbulence model in association with the 
DSMC method is proposed for the simulation of non-dense turbulent particle-laden flows. The 
performance of the proposed RANS+DSMC approach accounting for inter-particle collisions 
will be validated by comparing its computed results with both what obtained using the same 
RANS model but in association with the deterministic method for inter-particle collisions and 
the experimental data of Kulick et al. (1994) in the particle-laden channel flows. This work 
also investigates how to get the statistically significant solution by coupling with the DSMC 
procedure and discusses the efficiency of it. Furthermore, the importance of inter-particle 
collisions in the flow lading mixture of polydispersed particles is also discussed.

inter-particle collisions, and particle-wall collisions. The motion of a discrete particle 
suspending in fluid has been studied quite extensively. Historical background and a detailed 
account on the relevant works are available in the recent article by Michaelides (1997) and in 
the book of Crowe et al. (1998). For particles with material densities much larger than the 
carrier-fluid density as to be studied in this work, the virtual mass, Basset history, and 
buoyancy force have negligible effects on particles as compared to the other terms. Equations 
of a particle motion consist of translation and rotation parts, which are expressed, respectively, 
as follows.

force, respectively, of the fluid-particle interactive forces; FPi is the force due to a pressure 
gradient; FGi is the gravitational force; and TVi is the viscous shear torque. 
The quasi-steady drag force is determined using the empirical drag coefficient in terms 
of the particle Reynolds number, ReP, suggested by Schiller and Naumann (1993) as

approach. The fluctuating velocity of the carrier fluid along the particle trajectory is generated 
using the so-called Langevin equation model (Pasquill and Smith, 1983) as follows

where GR  is the Gaussian random number with a mean value of zero and a standard 
deviation of unity. The 2giu¢  can be calculated from the turbulence model used in the study. 
The first term on the right-hand side in Eq. (2.20) represents the correlated part while the 
second term contributes the random fluctuation of the velocity. The anisotropic correlation 
function Ri is given by 
exp( / )i LiR t T= -D            (2.21) 
where the Lagrangian integral time scale TLi is determined from (Mito and Hanratty, 2002)

2.2.2 Inter-particle collisions 
There consist two steps to search for particle collision pairs. First, all particles are 
advanced to the next time step ( t t+ D ) through solving the equations of motion without taking 
into account inter-particle collisions. Secondly, the occurrence of inter-particle collisions 
within the time step tD  is examined by using either the deterministic approach or the 
stochastic approach in this study. When a collision occurs, only the particle velocity and 
angular velocity are updated to the values after the collision, which are determined by the 
hard-sphere model with the assumption of spherical particles. 
Deterministic method 
In the deterministic method, the inter-particle collision partner is conditioned by Eq. 
(2.23) in which the distance between the l-th and the m-th particles 2ir  equals to the sum of 
the radius , ,( )p l p mr r+  during a time step Δt.

, , , , ,[ ( )] ( )t i t t i t i p l p mr h r r r r+D+ - = +         (2.23) 
If there are real roots, h1 and h2, of Eq. (2.23) and h1 < h2 , a collision is taken place between a 
pair at t + h1Δt as depicted in Fig. 2.3. The post-collision velocities, then, replace their

occurs, it indicates that the l-th sampling particle collides the m-th sampling particle during the 
time step Δt; and (only) the velocity of the l-th sampling particle is, thus, replaced by the 
post-collision velocity. By using Eq. (2.26), the probability of the m-th sampling particle to be 
chosen for the l-th sampling particle is 1 / Ncell. Equation (2.28) can be, thus, rewritten as 
{ int[ ] 1}CV lm CV CV NN P N R N R> - - -         (2.29) 
Actually, the right hand side of Eq. (2.29) is a new random number which has a uniform 
probability in the range of 0 1NR£ < . The probability to pass the condition Eq. (2.29) equals 
to NCVPlm. The total probability of the l-th particle to collide another particle ( lP ) equals to 
1
CVN
lm
m
P
=
å  as expressed in Eq. (2.26). It proves that the above process can also work for the cases 
of polysizes particles and non-constant Mm. 
Once a collision takes place, any point on the semispherical surface of the l-th particle 
in the direction of the relative velocity between the collision pair is a possible point of the 
contact. Considering a collision between the l-th and the m-th particles, the collision cylinder 
with the radius of (rp,l + rp,m) along the trajectory of a given particle is schematically shown in 
Fig. 2.4. The location of the contact point on the collision plane of the collision cylinder can 
be specified in terms of the displacement b (or the contact angle θ where

and the orientation. With an assumption of uniform colliding probability inside the collision 
cylinder, the fraction of collision possibility within the annular zone at the position b with db

The coefficients of restitution ( pe ) and slip friction ( pm ) are set to be 0.95 and 0.4, 
respectively, in the computations. By using the hard-sphere model, the post-collision velocities 
are the function of the velocities before the collision, the restitution coefficient, and the slip 
friction coefficient. 
 
2.2.3 Particle-wall collisions 
Wall roughness is an important factor in the processes of particle-wall collisions 
(Sommerfeld, 2003). Two wall roughness models accounting for the effects of particle-wall 
collision are tested in this study. The particle colliding the rough wall is modeled as the 
particle colliding the alternative virtual wall as shown in Fig. 2.5. The wall roughness seen by 
the particles in the model suggested by Tsuji et al. (1987) is simulated by assuming that the 
stochastic inclined angle α is composed of the incident angle η of particle trajectory and a 
random number R as

3.2 Unladen Flows 
Due to the fully developed characteristic of the fluid flow, two-dimensional (x- and

 imposed on the wall. The three-dimensional tracking is used to account 
for three-dimensional nature of particle motion and collisions. Note that the particle volume 
fractions are quite low, O(10-4), and the relative velocity between the gas and particle is quite 
low in the z-direction in the investigated fully-developed particle-laden flows. The 
contribution due to interfacial exchange terms was, therefore, negligible in the z-direction. The 
preliminary study of this thesis which compared the predictions between obtained with 3-D 
and 2-D gas-phase computations did confirm this conjecture. The gas-phase is thus calculated 
two-dimensionally in order to save the computational expenditure in the present study. 
Nevertheless, particles still moved three-dimensionally in the control volumes with a thickness 
of 0.75H in the z-direction even using 2-D calculation of gas-phase. However, in the cases of 
higher particle volume fractions, 3-D calculation is definitely necessary for the gas-phase 
computation. Considering the simplicity of the gas-phase in the investigated flows, a small 
number of the grid points in the streamwise direction are enough for 2-D RANS calculation of 
the fully-developed particle-laden channel flow. Two sets of C.V.s, 16 x 100 (x by y) and 32 x 
200, are used for the computations of a benchmark case of the fully developed channel flow 
without particle loading in which the DNS data (Abe et al., 2001) is available. The computed 
results of the mean streamwise velocity and all turbulence quantities ( , ,  gi gjk u ue ¢ ¢ ) using the 
two meshes are presented in Fig. 3.1 and are compared with the DNS data of Abe et al. (2001). 
Two observations can be made from the comparisons in Fig. 3.1. First, a nearly 
grid-independent solution can be achieved by using a rather coarse mesh of 16 x 100. This 
mesh is thereafter used in the following computations. In contrast, the LES computation of the 
same test problem conducted by Yamamoto et al. (2001) required a significant finer mesh of 
128 x 128 x 128 in the single-phase case and 64 x 48 x 64 in the two-phase cases. It 
demonstrates an advantage of computational savings in use of the RANS approach for the

The probability of the sampled contact angle θ obtained with the DSMC method follows a 
sinusoidal distribution as does the theoretical result. Furthermore, the probability of the 
contact angle determined with the deterministic method also exhibits the same sinusoidal 
distribution. Both the lateral distributions of the mean inter-particle collision frequency and 
mean volumetric fraction of the particles, obtained separately with the DSMC and 
deterministic methods, are well coincident as shown in Fig. 3.2b. Sommerfeld (2001) followed 
the derivation of Abrahamson (1975), which is a limiting case of the kinetic theory for St → ∞ 
in addition to the neglect of external (such as gravitational) forces, and obtained an 
approximate solution of the mean inter-particle collision frequency for the monodispersed 
particles as 
 1/ 2 2 2 1/ 24 | |C p p pif n d up ¢=           (3.4) 
where Pn  is the number density. The theoretical values of Cf  are calculated with the aid of 
the predicted Pn  and 2piu¢  in the simulation and are also plotted in Fig. 3.2b. The 
comparison shows that slight underprediction of the approximate solution, in comparison with 
the two present Cf  predictions, are observed except in the very near-wall region in which the 
effect of particle-wall collisions and the gradient of the mean gas-velocity are not considered 
in the derivation of Eq. (3.4). Overall, it validates that even the DSMC method is applicable to 
dilute turbulent particle-laden flows such as the investigated one with 70μm copper particles. 
Figure 3.3a shows the predicted, using the deterministic method, and the measured 
(Kulick et al, 1994) streamwise components of the mean velocity and the r.m.s. of the 
fluctuating velocity for the carrier gas and the particles in the flow laden with 70μm copper 
particles, while Fig. 3.3b shows the predicted and the measured results in the flow laden with 
50μm glass particles. Generally speaking, the agreement between the predictions and the 
measurements shown in Figs. 3.3a and 3.3b are satisfactory except for the properties of 70μm

presented in Fig. 3.5 for the purpose of comparison. Note the values of /p ct t  shown in Fig. 
3.4a are larger than unity. It implies that the effect of inter-particle collisions cannot be ignored 
in the present model formulation according to the criterion indicated in Eq. (1.1). As seen in 
Fig. 3.5, the results predicted separately with the DSMC and deterministic methods differ 
slightly each other, whereas the results predicted without considering inter-particle collisions 
differ much from those with considering inter-particle collisions as anticipated from the result 
of /p ct t  > 1 shown in Fig. 3.4a. 
Two more DSMC computations for the flow laden with 70μm copper particles but 
using less sampling particles, that is, M = 10 and 100 (equivalent to 1,590 and 159 sampling 
particles, respectively), are performed for the investigated steady flow. Their results are 
presented in Fig. 3.6 and compared with those obtained with M = 1. The statistical shot noise 
is obviously observed in the results of the two computations with M = 10 and 100. Other runs 
using the longer statistical sample collecting time of T2 - T1 = 100TM for the three cases 
discussed in Fig. 3.6 are further performed, and their results are presented in Fig. 3.7. Two 
observations can be made as follows. First, it discloses that the extent of statistical shot noise 
shown in Fig. 3.6 can be alleviated using longer collecting time in the particles’ statistics of Eq. 
(3.2). Second, the result obtained with the DSMC(1) method using the statistical sample 
collecting time of 100TM remains nearly invariant as compared to that using the shorter 
collecting time of 10TM (cf. Figs. 3.6 and 3.7). This indicates that a statistically significant 
solution has been achieved in the DSMC(1) computation by using the statistical sample 
collecting time of 10TM for the flow laden with 70μm copper particles. However, there still 
appear the statistical shot noise in the results obtained with M = 100. It implies that longer 
collecting time than 100TM is needed to pursue a statistically significant solution for the 
computation with M = 100, but no such effort is made in the study to find this answer. 
 
3.4 Analysis of Computation Expenditure (Ⅰ) 
It is known that the computational expenditure varies with the employed numerical model, M 
value (number of real particles represented by a sampling particle), and the sample collecting 
time for particles’ statistics. Figure 3.8a presents the total CPU time, which are required in the

needs longer sample collecting time to attain the particles’ statistics as discussed before, which, 
in turn, increases the required CPU time as shown in Fig. 3.8. For example, DSMC(10) 
required the sample collecting time of O(102 TM) to attain the statistically significant solution 
(cf. Figs. 3.6 and 3.7). 
 
3.5 Flow Properties in Glass Particle-Laden Flow 
Next the flow laden with 50μm glass particles but at the same mass loading ratio of 0.2 
as the previous test flow laden with 70μm copper particles is investigated. Since the glass 
particles are lighter and smaller than the copper particles, the second test flow consists of 
154,200 real glass particles, which is one order of magnitude larger than the particle number in 
the flow laden with 70μm copper particles. The predicted mean streamwise velocity of 
particles and the r.m.s. of pu¢  and pv¢ , using the models in which one is without considering 
inter-particle collisions (2-way coupling) and the other two are with considering inter-particle 
collisions but incorporated separately with the deterministic and the DSMC(1) methods, are 
presented in Fig. 3.9. Note the number of the sampling particles used in these three 
computations is the same as that of the real particles, and the sample collecting time used in 
Eq. (3.2) is set equal to 1TM, which is one order of magnitude less than the sample collecting 
time required for the attainment of a statistically significant solution in the DSMC(1) 
computation of the flow laden with 70μm copper particles. Once more, the results predicted 
separately with the deterministic and the DSMC methods agree well each other, as observed 
for the previous test flow laden with 70μm copper particles (see Fig. 3.5). Although the value 
of /p ct t  shown in Fig. 3.4b are larger than unity, their values are smaller than those in the 
previous test flow laden with 70μm copper particles (cf. Figs. 3.4a and 3.4b). This explains the 
existence of the deviations between the two flow properties of particles predicted separately 
by considering with and without inter-particle collisions, as shown in Fig. 3.9, but the 
deviations now become smaller than those shown in Fig. 3.5. 
Two additional DSMC computations using less sampling particles, that is, M = 10 and 
100 (equivalent to 15,420 and 1,542 sampling particles, respectively), are performed with the 
statistical sample collecting time of 1TM for the second test flow. Their results are presented in 
Fig. 3.10 and are compared with those obtained with M = 1. The statistical shot noise is

crossline symbol in Fig. 3.12) and the one laden with 15,900 copper particles (which is 
marked with a crossline symbol in Fig. 3.8) no matter what method/model is adopted in the 
computation. The other is that the gap between the two CPU time, which are required for the 
particles’ computations using separately the deterministic and the DSMC(1) methods, is 
significantly enlarged as the tracked particle number increasing from 15,900 (the case of 
copper particles, Fig. 3.8b) to 154,200 (the case of glass particles, Fig. 3.12b). This indicates 
that the DSMC method becomes more computationally inexpensive than the deterministic 
method as the real particle number in the investigated flow is increased. Again, Fig. 3.12 
shows that the required CPU time for the attainment of the statistically significant solution of 
particles’ flow properties by adopting the DSMC(10) method is slightly shorter than that by 
the DSMC(1) method, which has been disclosed in Fig. 3.8 for the flow laden with 70μm 
copper particles. It has to be noted that the use of a rather coarse grid mesh in the computation, 
which has been shown to be capable of yielding an accurate solution of the carrier gas for the 
present fully-developed channel flow, spent a little CPU time in the computational procedure 
of each marching time step. For the complex flows encountered in the engineering practices 
which have to be numerically solved using a much finer grid mesh than the present one, the 
computational expenditure for the flow solution of the carrier fluid would be noticeably 
increased. Thus the choice of less sampling particles, which must be accompanied with a 
longer statistical sample collecting time to attain a statistically significant solution, in the 
computation of the practical cases of particle-laden flows might not have such benefit of less 
computational expenditure as disclosed in this study. 
The total CPU cost for calculating the flow laden 15,900 copper particles by using the 
deterministic, DSMC(1), DSMC(10) and DSMC(100) method for the sample collecting time 
10TM are 66.98, 34.82, 4.255 and 1.214 minutes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3.8a. The 
computational expenditures of the DSMC(1), DSMC(10) and DSMC(100) methods are 52.0 
%, 6.35 %, and 2.17 % of the computational expenditure using the deterministic method, 
respectively. The CPU cost for calculating the flow laden 154,200 glass particles by using the 
deterministic, DSMC(1), DSMC(10) and DSMC(100) method for the sample collecting time 
1TM are 519.3, 70.66, 3.271 and 0.538 minutes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 12a. The 
computational expenditures of the DSMC(1), DSMC(10), and DSMC(100) methods are 13.6 
%, 0.63 %, and 0.10 %, respectively, of the computational expenditure using the deterministic

4. Turbulent Channel Flows Lading Binary Mixture of Particles 
Two binary mixtures of particles are considered in the fully developed turbulent air 
flow inside a vertical channel at the total mass loading ratio 0.2. The Reynolds number based 
on the channel half-width and friction velocity is 644. The flow characteristics are listed on 
Table 3.3. 
Binary mixture of particles different in sizes 
The first series of calculations was performed for the mixture of (A) 70μm Copper 
particles and (B) 14μm Copper particles with (4-way) / without (2-way) considering 
inter-particle collisions for the purpose of comparison. The streamwise mean velocity, r.m.s. of 
streamwise fluctuating velocity, r.m.s. of wall-normal fluctuating velocity of gas and particles 
are plotted on Figs. 3.15a-c, respectively. Without considering inter-particle collisions, the 
B-particle motion is much closer to the gas motion comparing the A-particle motion, because 
the Stokes number of B-particles ( /B Bp fSt t tº ) is always one order of magnitude less than the 
Stokes number of A-particles ( /A Ap fSt t tº ) as shown in Fig. 3.15d. It demonstrates that the 
A-particle dispersions have not followed turbulence eddies. 
The behaviors of A-particles predicted without considering inter-particle collisions 
differ much from those with considering inter-particle collisions. Otherwise, the predictions of 
B-particles do not exhibit significant difference in the region of y+ > 110. Figures 3.15d 
shows the distributions of /p ct t . The frequency of A-particle colliding B-particles (A-B 
collisions) is much larger than the collision frequency inter A-particles (A-A collisions). 
Therefore, the A-B collisions have contributed the main effect of inter-particle collisions 
toward the difference. /A ABp ct t  being always much larger than unity indicates that the 
A-particle motion is dominantly influenced by inter A-particles collisions in the whole flow 
region. It explains the significance of considering collisions of predicted A-particle motion. In 
contrast, even the collision frequency inter B-particles (B-B collisions) is much larger than the 
collision frequency of the B-particle colliding the A-particles (B-A collisions), /B BBp ct t  is

different in sizes or materials. 
 
5. Conclusions 
An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach accounting for inter-particle collisions, based on a 
RANS turbulence model for the carrier fluid and a stochastic Lagrangian model for the 
particles, is developed. The mean quantities of the carrier-fluid properties are computed using 
the low-Reynolds-number nonlinear eddy-viscosity turbulence model developed by Abe et al. 
(2003), while the fictitious fluctuations of the carrier-fluid velocity are generated by the 
so-called Langevin model. The stochastic Lagrangian modeling approach follows basically the 
DSMC method. For validating the developed stochastic Lagrangian model, the results 
obtained with the deterministic method are used to serve as a comparison basis. It has been 
demonstrated that the developed stochastic model of inter-particle collisions can perform as 
well as does the deterministic model of inter-particle collisions but saves computational 
expenditure noticeably, even in the case loaded with a low number density of particles such as 
the tested flow laden with 70μm copper particles. 
A parametric sensitivity study on how to obtain the statistically significant solution of 
the particles, the properties is performed by changing either the number of sampling particles 
or the time interval for the sample collection used in the statistics of Eq. (3.2). It is shown that 
the less sampling particles are tracked in the DSMC process, the longer statistical sample 
collecting time in the statistical calculation is required to attain a statistically significant 
solution of the particles’ flow properties. The benefit of saving computational expenditure in 
use of the DSMC method becomes more remarkable as the number of the particles loaded in 
the flow is increased. 
This study also investigates the relative importance of inter-particle collisions of the 
binary mixture of particles in particle-laden turbulent flows. It is found that the significance of 
inter-particle collisions should be made in terms of the local time scales of the particle 
response time ( pt ), turbulent flow time scale ( ft ), and particle mean free time ( ct ) in contrast 
to the traditional manner since the characteristics of fluid and particle motions may differ in 
the different regions in the flow.
