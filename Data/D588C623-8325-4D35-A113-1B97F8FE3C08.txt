英文摘要 
Au/Si substrate was first used to grow Si nanowires in a horizontal tube furnace with three 
temperature zones. After the Si nanowires were successively cleaned, sensitized, and activated, 
Ni films were deposited on the surface of the Si nanowires in an electroless plating bath. The 
electroless Ni deposited-Si nanowires were then annealed at 500℃ for 1hr. After removing the 
excess Ni metal on the surface of nanowires by HNO3 solution, the polycrystalline NiSi 
nanowires were finally obtained. The transmision electron microscopy, field emission scanning 
electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry were used to characterize the nanowires 
for morphology, microstructure, crystal structure, and composition.

The Au/Si substrate was placed in the third zone of which temperature was kept at 750℃. The 
pressure in the horizontal quartz tube was maintained at 10-6 torr. An Ar gas with a flow rate of 
10 sccm was conducted into the tube from the first zone end for carrying gaseous Si atoms from 
the second zone to the third zone. Under the catalysis of Au, the Si nanowire could be grown on 
the Au/Si substate. 
Before a Ni film was electrolessly plated on Si nanowire, the surface of Si nanowire needed 
to be treated by the following steps. The Si nanowire was first dipped in HF solution (10%HF) 
for removing the native oxide on the surface of Si nanowire; then dipped in a solution of SnCl2 
and HCl for sensitizing the surface of Si nanowire and in a solution of PdCl2 and HCl for the 
deposition of Pd to trigger the electroless Ni plating; and finally dipped again in HF solution for 
removing the silicon oxide formed in the previous steps. 
The electroless Ni plating bath consists of nickel sulfate (NiSO4.6H2O, 20g/l) as the nickel 
ion source, sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2.H2O, 27g/l) as the reducing agent, sodium citrate 
(Na2C4H4OH.6H2O, 16g/l) as the complexing agent, and lead ion (Pb2+, 1ppm) as the stablizing 
agent. The electroless Ni plating was operated at temperature of 70℃ and pH value of 5.0. The 
as-deposited sample was in vacuum annealed for 1 hour in a furnace at 500℃ to obtain the 
NiSi nanowire . The annealed sample was then dipped in a 30 % HNO3 solution at room 
temperature for 1 hour to remove the excess Ni metal on the surface of NiSi nanowire.  
All samples, containing activated Si nanowire, electroless Ni plated Si nanowire, and NiSi 
nanowire,were characterized by a filed emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL 
JSM-6330FEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM,JEOL JEM-2010) for the 
morphology, microstructure and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The 
chemical composition of nanowires was determined by an energy dispersive X-ray 
spectroscope (EDS) equipped with FESEM and TEM.   
 
3. Result and discussion  
Fig 2. shows the TEM view (a) and the EDS spectrum (b) of Si nanowires after sensitization 
and activation process. There are dark spots dispersed on the surface of Si nanowires, which are 
Pd particles confirmed by the EDS spectrum shown in Fig 2 (b). The Pd particles ranges from 
several to several tens nanometers in size and the Si nanowires have thickness about equal to or 
smaller than 50 nanometers. These Pd particles are formed in the activation process by the 
following reaction:  
Sn0 + Pd2+ Æ Pd0 + Sn2+, where Sn0 is formed in the sensitization process. The Pd particles 
are very important for triggering the nucleation of Ni film on the surface of Si nanowires in 
electroless plating bath.  
The FESEM image and the EDS spectrum of electroless Ni-deposited Si nanowires are 
shown in Fig 3 (a) and (b), respectively. It can be clearly seen from Fig 3 (a) that the electroless 
Ni is quite uniformly deposited on the surface of Si nanowires and has a particle form. The 
EDS spectrum shown in Fig. 3 (b) reveals that excepting Si, Ni and P, there is O existing in 
Ni-deposited Si nanowires, which may be adsorbed from air by means of the oxidization of Ni 
when the sample is exposed to the atmosphere. 
Fig 4 (a) and (b) show the TEM image and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern 
of an electroless Ni deposited-Si nanowire. As shown in Fig 4 (a), the Ni particles are quite

 Polycrystalline NiSi nanowires can be formed by electroless nickel deposite on Si nanowires 
after 500 ℃, 1 hr vacuum annealing. The particle size of deposited nickel is about 46 nm. Nickel 
diffuse into Si nanowires formed NiSi nanowires afer vacuum annealing. The diameter of 
polycrystalline NiSi nanowire is about 50 nm. The formation of polycrystalline NiSi nanowires is 
owing to the distribution of nickel particles is not uniform and silicon dioxide layer of Si nanowires 
which retard the diffusion of nickel into silicon. The structure, morphology, and composition of 
NiSi nanowires are investigated by transmission electron microscope, field emission scanning 
electron microscope, and energy dispersive spectra, respectively. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 One dimensional nanowire materials of transition metal silicides such as NiSi, CoSi2, TiSi2 
can be used as nanoscale building blocks for the bottom-up assembly of integrated photonic, 
electronic, and spintronic nanosystems [1]. The silicides, CoSi2 and TiSi2, were reported there are 
some limitations. TiSi2 has sheet resistance dependent on linewidth and CoSi2 consumes more Si 
than TiSi2 [2]. Due to its lower resistivity, Si consumption, and formation temperature [3], NiSi is a 
better promising candidate than other silicide materials. 
A research group (Kim et al.) [4~9] grew NiSi nanowires at 575℃ by metal induced growth 
method. In their process, SiO2 is first plasma deposited on a Si wafer and a Ni film is then plated on 
SiO2 by thermal evaporation. Using D.C magnetron sputtering process, Si nanoparticles were 
deposited on Ni/SiO2/Si substrate with a temperature of 575℃. The nickel silicide is first formed 
which then leads to nanowire formation. The growth of nickel silicide nanowires was also achieved 
in the temperature of 320℃ to 400℃ by decomposition of silane on Ni/SiO2/Si substrate [10]. The 
nickel silicide nanowires could be controlled to align between two electrodes by applying electric 
fields and dielectric media [11]. NiSi nanowire arrays could self-assemble on epitaxial Si0.3Ge0.7 
on 100 Si [12]. 
NiSi nanowire has superior properties in terms of effective current density and propagation speed 
compared to Cu and CNT, which make NiSi nanowire the most promising candidate for future 
on-chip interconnections [13]. The NiSi nanowire was spontaneously grown across a trench 
  
(6) Characterization of NiSi nanowires 
Field emission scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope was used for 
characterization of deposited samples. The chemical composition of the nanowire was determined 
by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) . 
 
3. Results and discussions 
 
 Fig. 2 is FESEM image of Si nanowire after electroless nickel plating 10 seconds. There are 
many particles on the Si nanowires. The composition of particles was nickel that examined by EDS. 
TEM image of the same sample is shown in Fig. 3. TEM micrographs show that almost the nickel 
particles adhere to Si nanowires uniformly (Fig. 3a-c) and some nickel particles are not uniform.  
 Fig. 4 shows the TEM micrograph and EDS spectra of the Si nanowires after sensitizing and 
activation. The size and distribution of particle on the Si nanowire is not uniform. EDS spectra 
reveal the particle is Pd. Nickel deposited near the Pd particles only. Therefore, the distribution of 
Pd particles on Si nanowire will influence the distribution of nickel particles. The distribution of Pd 
particle on the Si nanowire is not uniform will induce the distribution of nickel particle on the Si 
nanowire is also not uniform. 
 Fig. 5 is FESEM image of Si nanowire after electroless nickel plating 10 seconds and 
annealing at 500 ℃, 1 hr. There are some particles still remain on the nanowire surface. These 
particles may be nickel oxide which can＇t remove by HNO3 solution. 
 Fig. 6 is the TEM micrograph (BF and DF) and EDS spectra of Si nanowire after electroless 
nickel plating 10 seconds and annealing at 500 ℃, 1 hr. Fig. 6 a and b show the polycrystalline 
NiSi nanowires formed after annealing. The EDS spectra reveal the composition of NiSi nanowires 
is 48.59 at.% Ni and 51.41 at.% Si (Fig 6c). Fig. 7 is another TEM micrograph of NiSi nanowire. 
This also evidence the NiSi nanowires are polycrystalline. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
 The results show that the polycrystalline NiSi nanowires formed after electroless nickel plating 
10 seconds and annealing at 500 ℃, 1 hr. The formation of polycrystalline NiSi nanowires is owing 
to the distribution of nickel particles is not uniform and silicon dioxide layer of Si nanowires which 
retard the diffusion of nickel into silicon.
