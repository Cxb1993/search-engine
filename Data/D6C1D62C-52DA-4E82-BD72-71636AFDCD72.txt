Abstract 
With the advent of wireless network 
technologies, some heritage temples had begun 
to provide mobile devices for navigation and 
mobile learning. However, when visitors use the 
mobile device, their attention will be divided 
3 
client-server architecture for multi-user 
applications and a game engine for location 
based museum games. After reviewing a great 
deal of existing AR systems for cultural heritage 
and museum guides, Damala et al. (2007) 
concluded that trying to make abstraction of the 
technological constraints is of paramount 
importance for the development of Augmented 
Reality applications 
 
3. Field Study 
The authors first conducted a field study through 
observing the tourists’ behaviors in a heritage 
temple, Lungshan Temple, located in Taipei. In 
addition, the authors interviewed some tourists 
and temple administrators to elicit the 
requirements of user interface design for mobile 
learning. This temple was founded in 1738 and 
dedicated to the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy. It 
was famous for its magnificent architectural 
ornaments, such as Taiwan's only copper-cast 
dragon column. The temple's doors, beams and 
poles were beautifully decorated with auspicious 
animals (such as dragon, phoenix, and unicorn) 
and the sculpture of folktales.  
 
4. System Implementation 
Based on the results of observation and 
interview, a user interface prototype was built on 
a Ultra Mobile PC (UMPC) with a 5.6 inch 
touch-screen and physical keyboards. Since the 
prototype weighed 600g, it should be held using 
both hands or carried by a dispatch bag. With 
this ergonomically designed bag, the tourists 
were able to enjoy the journey without worrying 
about how to carry it while walking in the 
crowded temple. Tourists could use the camera 
to capture the image of marks located near the 
spots with heritage features. The media 
introducing the heritage features would show up 
to provide augmented information superimposed 
on the corresponding background. In the media, 
animated characters or creatures in the folktales 
were re-built to deliver the story of the ancient. 
These contents help tourists understand the 
history and traditional culture of Taiwan. The 
user interface of Augmented Reality system was 
constructed based on ARToolKit and user 
interface widgets. The 3D digital skeleton 
models of characters and animals were created 
using Maya 8.5. Real-time rendering of these 
models were executed and displayed using 
graphic modules. In addition to the story 
contents, virtual direction arrows and landmarks 
were provided at each spot to help visitors 
navigate in the temple. Figure 1 demonstrated 
the sys tem operating architecture. The scenario 
with an augmented content was presented in 
Figure 2.

Figure 2: The Scenario of Using Augmented 
Contents 
 
Based on this architecture, three prototypes 
of user interfaces were constructed. They both 
5 
time. Furthermore, they could use the function 
of print screen to capture the image of 
superimposition. Some participants even 
creatively extended this function by asking their 
friends to stand aside the mark so that the 
background, the people, and the augmented 
contents appeared in the same picture, thus 
increasing the pleasure of visiting. 
The recommendations about two services 
provided by participants were summarized as 
follows: 
(1) The size of virtual objects should be limited 
to prevent coverage of background 
(2) Cute style and simple characters were more 
user- friendly  
(3) Animated objects were better 
(4) Sound effects and interactive virtual 
characters could increase the impression 
 
The recommendations about three UI concepts 
were summarized as follows: 
(1) Transparent background of virtual objects 
and text message boxes were better  
(2) Increase the size of font 
(3) Increase the size of menu 
(4) The proportion of text message boxes should 
be less than one-third of the screen  
 
The ratings of performances among three UI 
concepts were showed in Table 1. Concepts 1 
and 2 had higher ratings than concept 3. 
Separated screens and solid background color 
hampered the navigation and increased the 
perceived workload of participants. 
 
6. Discussion 
Although the first attempt was successful, the 
participants still encounter some problems of 
carrying such a big device. For example, tourists 
always had their backpack or carried cameras. 
The dispatch bag of the device sometimes 
interfered with their personal equipment. In 
addition, even though the augmented contents 
were able to deliver virtual objects 
superimposed on the background, the shape and 
texture of these objects were still rough 
compared to the beauty of the temple 
architecture. The mark recognition process was 
too sensitive so that some users had difficulties 
in finding the right angle between the camera 
and the mark. Furthermore, the color contrast of 
the virtual foreground and the physical 
background were influenced significantly by the 
glare of light.

The results of experiment showed that user

with sound effects. In addition, transparent 
background of images and text message boxes 
were better. The superimposed information 
should not cover more than fifty percents of the 
screen so that users could still see the 
background clearly.

A great deal of research had pointed out that 
using games to learn can more effectively 
enhance the user’s interest and effect. In 
addition,  augmented reality technology can

Based on these findings, a product concept of 
such a system was designed and shown as 
follows. The product concept is easy to carry 
compared to existing UMPC. In addition, the 
location of camera is appropriate for the user to 
capture the image of tag and background.

The design solutions proposed by this research 
and the problems encountered are important 
references for designers working either in 
augmented reality interface design or game 
design. 
 
4. Recommendation for Future Research 
Based on these findings, the research team had 
identified specific fields for further research to 
leverage between limited resources on current 
mobile devices and the design of user interfaces 
based on AR. First, the location and setup of 
marks deserve further experiments to avoid the 
influence of peripheral lighting. Second, the 
devices and algorithms for mark recognition 
need to be improved. Third, specific algorithms 
for real-time rendering of 3D models for AR 
should be developed. Fourth, the mapping of 
touch gestures and dynamics of content display 
should be addressed.

Abstract. In order to reduce switching attention and increase the performance 
and pleasure of mobile learning in heritage temples, the objective of this  
research was to employ the technology of Augmented Reality (AR) on the user 
interfaces of mobile devices. Based on field study and literature review, three 
user interface prototypes were constructed. They both offered two service 
modes but differed in the location of navigation bars and text display  
approaches. The results of experiment showed that users preferred animated and 
interactive virtual objects or characters with sound effects. In addition, trans-
parent background of images and text message boxes were better. The superim-
posed information should not cover more than thirty percents of the screen  
so that users could still see the background clearly.

1   Introduction 
With the advent of wireless network technologies, some heritage temples had begun 
to provide mobile devices for navigation and mobile learning. However, when visitors 
used the mobile device, their attention was divided into three parts, i.e., the environ-
ment, the user interface and digital contents on the devices, and other participants. 
Divided and distracted attentions reduced the usability and pleasure in using such 
systems. In order to reduce switching attention and increase the performance and 
pleasure of mobile learning, the objective of this research was to employ the technol-
ogy of Augmented Reality (AR) on the user interfaces of mobile devices. With such 
user interfaces, the image and information can be superimposed on the background. 
Visitors could experience the rebuilt 3D images while some cultural heritage was 
damaged in the temples as well.

They both offered two service modes but differed in the location of navigation bars 
and text display approaches. The first prototype superimposed digital images on the 
background and contained a navigation bar at the middle of the screen and a semi-
