Abstract 
 
In the past few years, the SnAgCu family of solders has obtained a wide acceptance 
as a replacement for the PbSn eutectic solder for electronic applications. There are 
several popular SnAgCu compositions, including Sn(3.90.2)Ag(0.60.2)Cu, 
recommended by NEMI, Sn3Ag0.5Cu, recommended by Senju, and the AIM 
CASTIN 之 Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu0.5Sb. At present, relatively fewer activities are undertaken by 
researchers worldwide to develop another solder family to replace the PbSn eutectic 
solder. Instead, the current main research thrust in lead-free solder alloy development is 
on enhancing or fine-tuning the various properties of SnAgCu through adding minor 
alloying elements. In 2002, our research group first showed that Ni could substantially 
hinder the Cu3Sn growth during soldering as well as during the following solid-state 
aging. We later also showed that Fe and Co additions had similar effects. More 
importantly, additions as minute as 100 ppm (0.01 wt. %) was proven to be effective. 
As the Cu3Sn growth had been linked to the formation of micro voids, which in turn 
increased the potential for brittle interfacial fracture. Recently, it was indeed shown by 
research group from TI that drop test performance decreased with thickening of the 
Cu3Sn layer. The formation of the micro voids with the growth of Cu3Sn had been 
identified in both the reaction of SnAgCu and Cu and eutectic PbSn with Cu. This 
suggested that the root cause for the formation of these micro voids is the binary reaction 
between Sn and Cu. Accordingly, the Ni addition to solders offers the potential benefit of 
raising solder joint reliability through decreasing the amount of the micro voids.  
    The key objectives of this study are to examine the effects of micro alloy additions 
on the interfacial reactions between the solders and the Cu substrate, and to understand 
the fundamental mechanism for such effects. The effects of alloy additions on the 
mechanical properties of the solder joints will also be assessed. The alloy elements to be 
investigated include Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Ti. (Here we view Cu in SnAgCu as an alloying 
element.) The objective is to establish an understanding on the effects of different levels 
of alloy additions on the interfacial reactions during the reflow as well as during the 
aging stage. The underlying mechanism will be explored. In addition, the solder volume 
effect on the reactions will be investigated. The accomplishment of the stated objectives

研究目的 
 
微電子工業目前以銲接的方式，將電子零件連接到印刷電路板上
(Printed Circuit Board, PCB)。而隨著製程技術的進步，與電子產品輕薄、短小、
高功能的要求，採用面的方式排列之銲點矩陣來進行連接已成為當今主流，從外層
封裝的球矩陣式封裝（Ball Grid Array, BGA），到內層封裝的IC 製程中的覆晶（Flip 
chip, FC）製程技術都是這種例子。這些銲點的品質對整體成品的良率有直接
的影響。事實上，只要電子產品內數以千計的任一銲點失效，都會造成
整個電子產品的故障，因此相關電子產業對銲點可靠性的重視程度與日
俱增。而銲點與基材進行銲接時，銲料會與基材上的金屬發生化學反
應，進而在界面生成一或多種介金屬，這些介金屬對銲點的可靠度影響
甚鉅。因此，欲提升銲點可靠度，必須了解銲點與基材間的界面反應。 
鉛錫銲料一直是微電子工業最主要，且最常用的銲料。然而鉛會對人體及環
境造成毒害，也因此過去各國一直有禁用含鉛銲料的呼聲。事實上歐盟已決定要在
2006 年全面禁用含鉛銲料。屆時各國所生產的含鉛產品，將無法再前往該地區來銷
售。電子工業一直是我國經濟中最重要的一項產業，歐洲亦是我國主要的銷售市場
之ㄧ。我國的電子產業若要能長久發展，無鉛製成的開發與研究已是當前所必須面
對的。無鉛銲料的種類繁多，其中 SnAgCu 銲料因受到 NEMI [45]及 JEITA 之推薦
[46]，受到最多的重視。SnAgCu 銲料的組成相當廣泛，其大致的應用範圍在
Sn(3-4)Ag(0-1)Cu (wt.%)。 
2005 年美國德州儀器 Zeng 等人利用聚焦離子束，清楚顯示 Cu3Sn/Cu 界面有
一整排的微孔洞(micro voids)[1]。此一結果證實 solder/Cu 界面的脆化，實源於此一
整排 micro voids 的生長所致，而此 micro voids 的發生機制，一般則認為與 Cu3Sn 的
生長息息相關。換句話說，銲點界面的強度實與 Cu3Sn 的生長有著密切關係，亦即
micro voids 之數量會隨著 Cu3Sn 增厚而增多，若能降低 Cu3Sn 厚度將可減少 micro 
voids 之數量，進而達到增加銲點強度之目的。     
本計畫之總目標是深入了解微量元素的添加對無鉛銲料與 Cu 反應所產生之影
響。研究除了將對現象作一完整觀察與描述外，並將對其機制作深入探討，此外並
將初步評估微量元素的添加對銲點機械性質的影響。本研究將使用組成為 Sn2.5Ag
之銲料母合金，母合金中將添加微量之 Fe、Co、Ni、Cu、Ti 等五種元素之一種或
多種。配製完成之銲料將製備成數種不等直徑之銲錫球，再用來與晶片承載機板上
之 Cu 銲墊進行反應。本實驗係以 BGA 及 Flip-Chip 不同尺度的銲點，探討 SnAgCu
銲料中微量添加 Fe、Co、Ni、Cu、Ti 等元素，對其與 Cu 基材銲接的影響。

德州儀器的研究人員並在 2004 年證實 [5]，此類 Kirkendall voids 的確會造成
電子產品之可靠度下降。德州儀器的研究人員由墜落試驗(drop test)壽命對熱處理時
間作圖(圖 3)，可以清楚看出在還未熱處理時，大約 90 次 drop test cycles 會使有一
半銲點失效；而當經過 125oC、10 天熱處理後，只要經過約 20 次 drop test cycles 就
會有ㄧ半銲點失效，drop test performance 降低 80%。伴隨著抗摔能力的下降的則是
如圖 1 所示大量 Kirkendall voids 之生成。 Kirkendall voids 生成會影響電子產品使用
的壽命，而 Kirkendall voids 只會出現在 Cu3Sn/Cu 界面處或在 Cu3Sn 內部，都與 Cu3Sn
的生長有關。因此研究 Cu3Sn 的生長行為就顯得格外重要，能夠抑制此一介金屬生
長的因素，理論上應會對提升銲點可靠度有所幫助。

添加微量之 Fe, Co,或 Ni 雖然能夠減緩 Cu3Sn 的生長，並進而減少界面 Kirkendall 
voids 的數量，文獻中之初步證據也顯示銲點可靠度也隨之改善[24] 。但此一手段
只能延後大量 Kirkendall voids 出現的時間，當高溫儲藏時間夠久，Cu3Sn 仍會增厚，
因而大量之 Kirkendall voids 仍終將出現，問題仍未根本解決。但本研究團隊最新的
研究成果顯示，若在 SnAgCu 銲料中添加足量的Cu 將可徹底抑制Kirkendall voids 在
Cu3Sn 內生成。圖 8 顯示當銲料中 Cu 濃度到達 0.8 wt.% 時，縱然 Cu3Sn 已生長到
一定的厚度，在界面處仍然無 Kirkendall voids 的生成。但是當銲料中並無 Cu 的存
在時，Cu3Sn 內確有大量的 Kirkendall voids 生成。

故不預期會遭遇困難。本實驗觀察的重點包含：(1) Cu6Sn5、Cu3Sn 的種
類、形態及生長動力等分析以及 (2) Cu 基材隨時間消耗的狀況。(3) 
Kirkendall’s voids 生長情形。  
 
 
3.2：添加微量元素以及體積效應對銲料與 Cu 反應之影響: 
1. 銲料製備：本實驗採用三種直徑的銲錫球: 760, 500, 300 μm，其體積比約為
16:5:1。 
 
2. Cu 基板種類: 本研究所使用的基板為以 CuSO4電解液，電鍍而成的 Cu 板，
BGA 晶片承載機板上之 Cu 銲墊直徑計畫採用 400 μm 開口。 
 
3. 銲接反應條件 (液固反應 ):迴銲的過程中重要的參數有迴銲時間，
迴銲頂溫及升降溫速度。由於本實驗使用的是 SnAgX 銲料，故迴
銲頂溫定於  235oC，升降溫速度則使用常採用的 1.5 oC/s，迴銲的
次數則分別為 1， 3， 5， 10 次，迴銲時間是 90 s。  
 
4. 固態熱處理反應條件 (固固反應 ): 將一次迴銲後之銲點置於 160、
180、200、220oC 下，再進行 100, 500, 1000, 1500 以及 2000 小時
之高溫熱儲藏。  
 
5. 反應結果的觀察與分析：將反應完之試片經金相研磨、拋光，再以不同之儀
器觀測其結構及組成。低溫銲料的研磨與拋光是屬相當高難度的操作，主要
是因為其硬度甚低，而延展性高，況且其中又有高硬度，低延展性之介金屬
居於其中。但申請人過去曾成功地處理硬度更低之銦合金及其他種類銲料合
金 [29-34]，故此一部份亦不成問題。拋光後之銲點以光學顯微鏡及掃描式電
子顯微鏡(SEM)觀察其結構，以電子微探儀(EPMA)量測其組成，再以 X 光繞
射儀(XRD)決定生成物之晶體結構。本實驗觀察的重點包含：觀察在不同銲
點體積下，微量元素是否仍具有影響界面反應的效果，以及微量元素和體積

結果與討論 
 
4.1 添加微量 Fe、Co、Ni 元素對銲料與 Cu 反應之影響 
4.1.1 在 Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu 添加相同濃度的 Fe、Co、Ni 
 
    圖 9 為Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu0.03X (X=Fe、Co、Ni)銲錫球與Cu 墊層一次迴銲後銲點
截面圖，介金屬形狀從原本貝殼狀轉變為類似樹枝型態，至於介金屬型態為何呈現
樹枝型態，推測是因為加入Fe、Co、Ni 於銲料中降低Sn 對Cu 的溶解度，介金屬
快速析出所造成。在圖10 熱處理反應中可以清楚看出只要在銲錫球裡添加0.03 
wt.% Fe、Co、Ni，Cu3Sn生長速度明顯降低，大致上都能維持對照組Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu 
中Cu3Sn 厚度的三分之ㄧ，0.03wt.%的Fe、Co、Ni 對Cu3Sn 的抑制效果是一樣的。
另外，由圖10(e)、(f)可看出同時在銲料中加入Fe、Ni 或是Co、Ni 對於抑制Cu3Sn 生
長並沒有加乘的功效。添加Fe、Co、Ni 於銲料中的原因為其原子半徑與Cu 相近，
再加上FE-EPMA 組成分析數據我們推測，微量元素會溶解到Cu 原子中佔據
vacancy 位置，當vacancy 數目減少了，Sn、Cu 原子的擴散速度減慢，生成的Cu3Sn 
變薄。

下經過1000 小時熱處理截面圖。 
 
 
4.1.3 在Sn 中添加不同濃度的Cu 
 
    為了更進一步研究微孔洞的形成，接下來的實驗將分別探討Cu 墊層以及銲料
中Cu濃度對界面微孔洞的影響。為了應證銲料中Cu 濃度與微孔洞形成的關係，我
們配製一系列SnxCu 合金(x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5wt.%)，與Cu 反應。為了清楚表
示銲料中Cu濃度與micro voids 的關係，我們使用方程式(1)來估計反應後銲料內總
Cu 濃度，ρsolder、ρCu 分別為銲料與Cu 密度7.4、8.9 g/cm3，WCuo 為原本銲錫球中
Cu 組成，TCu 為Cu 墊層在經過反應後所消耗的厚度，djoint、dpad 分別為銲錫球的
直徑與銲墊開孔之大小，Vsolder、VCu 分別為銲料及反應後消耗的Cu墊層體積。由此
方程式計算出反應後銲料內總Cu 濃度，再將總Cu 濃度對反應時間平方根作圖，見
圖12。(1)圖 13 為SnxCu 與Cu 墊層經一次迴銲後界面截面圖， 界面生成物為貝
殼狀的Cu6Sn5，當試片經過160oC 熱處理時，界面生成物分別為Cu6Sn5、Cu3Sn兩介
金屬層，見圖14。當反應時間到達500 小時，Cu3Sn 中皆沒有微孔洞生成，而在經
過1000 小時以上熱處理後，圖中6(a2-a3)以及(b2-b3)Cu3Sn中有微孔洞生成，由於微

4.1.4 微量元素 
 
微量元素的添加有助於減少 Cu3Sn 生長厚度，許多學者都在進行這方面的研
究，不過其所添加的量大都＞0.1 wt. %，為了深入探究微量元素最小使用量，我們
實驗室在銲料中添加<0.1 wt%(0.005, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06wt.%)微量的Ni，仍有效抑制
Cu3Sn 生成，進而抑制微孔洞生長。為何微量元素的添加如此有效抑制Cu3Sn 生
成，雖有許多研究學者從熱力學[35]以及動力學[36-37]角度上解釋，所添加的微量
元素將使介金屬變得更穩定，擴散速度降低，但這些解釋卻未完全說明其抑制的機
制，關於這方面還需要更多研究結果來瞭解。微孔洞的生成為何會有 micro voids 在
界面處生長?這是因為在介金屬Cu3Sn 中所有原子擴散是藉由空孔機制，由於向外
擴散的原子總通量遠大於擴散進來的原子通量，當空孔濃度大於一臨界值空洞將成
核，在Cu3Sn/Cu 界面處造成空孔累積，最後形成空洞，使銲點容易斷裂。如何有
效抑制微孔洞生成，由本實驗室近年來研究顯示有以下方法：微量Fe、Co、Ni 添
加；使用高純度Cu；提高銲料中Cu 濃度，將分別說明如下。 
 
4.1.5 Cu 墊層種類 
 
Kivilahti 等人提出使用Cu 墊層的種類會影響micro voids 生成，使用電鍍Cu 
時，由於在電鍍過程產生不純物和結晶缺陷，促進孔洞成核[38]。這現象和我們在
探討Ni 的添加與不同Cu 墊層雙重效果實驗結果相符[39]，當使用電鍍Cu 時，在
1000、2000 小時熱處理的試片上有micro voids，而當使用高純度Cu 時，表面較緻
密且無雜質，microvoids 不易在界面處產生。 
 
4.1.6 銲料中 Cu 濃度 
 
由以上的討論我們知道既然所使用的Cu 墊層會影響micro voids，那麼銲料中
Cu濃度對micro voids 的影響又是如何? 關於這方面研究目前並無其他學者從事，由
我們實驗結果可知在Cu 濃度＞0.58 wt%時可抑制微孔洞，我們推測抑制micro voids 
生成的可能原因為銲料中Cu 濃度改變Cu3Sn 介金屬中Cu、Sn 介擴散速度，因此
抑制micro voids生成，至於詳細原因還有待更進一步的實驗來證實。

4.2 添加微量元素以及體積效應對銲料與 Cu 反應之影響 
 
表一為不同的銲錫球與 Ni 反應之生成物經 EPMA 分析後的化學組成。其反應
結果，如圖 16、圖 17 所示。結果顯示，界面共有(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 與(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 兩種介
金屬。此兩種介金屬的形態是受到 Cu 濃度及銲料體積的影響。以下，分別對不同
Cu 濃度銲錫球的反應結果做詳細說明。 
 
4.2.1 Sn3Ag0.6Cu 的銲錫球 
圖 16 (a)-(c)是直徑 760，500，及 300 μm 的 Sn3Ag0.6Cu 銲錫球與 Ni 墊層經過
90 秒廻銲的結果。而圖 17 (a)-(c)則是顯示其廻銲時間拉長至 20 分鐘的結果。當直
徑 760 μm的 Sn3Ag0.6Cu銲錫球與Ni墊層反應 90秒時，只有一層針狀的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
連續層於界面生成，参閱圖 16 (a)。當反應時間延長至 20 分鐘時，則此(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
的形狀仍然為針狀結構，但其厚度增厚至約 2-3 μm，参閱圖 17 (a)。由於此介金屬
的厚度夠厚，故可使用 EPMA 來分析其組成。其結果為(Cu0.64Ni0.36)6Sn5，参閱表 1。
若銲錫球直徑縮小至 500 μm 時，界面的情形則與 760 μm 之結果相似，仍然為針狀
的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 結構，参閱圖 16 (b)、圖 17 (b)。同時， EPMA 的結果亦顯示兩者間
並無明顯差異(表 1)。 
非常有趣的是，當銲錫球直徑縮小到 300 μm，反應結果竟與大銲錫球(直徑 760
及 500 μm)有所不同。此時的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 不再是針狀結構，而是變成圓形顆粒狀，
参閱圖 16 (c)。值得注意的是，在(Cu,Ni)6Sn5與 Ni 層間則有(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 的生成。此
結果係與文獻[40-42]的實驗結果有明顯的差異，其原因將於本文第 4 節來加以探
討。另一方面，在(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 與(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 兩介金屬間，則發現有一排圓形的孔洞
將兩介金屬隔開，如圖 3 (c)。當廻銲時間再拉長至 20 分鐘，此時(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 將會
spalling，而離開了銲點界面，参閱圖 17 (c)。圖 18 為圖 17 (c)的銲點全貌。由圖 18
可知，(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 整層剝離界面，而(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 與(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 間有許多銲料開始填
入。換句話說，在圖 16 (c)中的孔洞，有可能是(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 想要從界面剝離的中段
過程。有關上述之(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 生成與(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 剝離的機制將會在底下的討論中來
加以說明。

26 
 
4.2.2 Sn3Ag0.5Cu 的銲錫球 
當 Cu 濃度從 0.6 wt.%降低到 0.5 wt.%時，大銲錫球(直徑 760 及 500 μm)的
反應生成物均為(Cu,Ni)6Sn5，其形狀也都為針狀結構，参閱圖 16 (d)-(e)。此外，
其組成若經由 EPMA 分析則可發現也與 Sn3Ag0.6Cu 的結果相似，約為
(Cu0.60Ni0.40)6Sn5，参閱表 1。 
若銲錫球直徑繼續縮小到 300 μm，其反應結果則與大銲錫球(直徑 760及 500 
μm)有所不同。此時界面有(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 與(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 兩種介金屬生成，如圖 16 
(f)。(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 則呈現不連續，其形狀也不再是針狀，而是轉變成橄欖狀。此外
夾雜於(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 間，也發現有少量的(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 顆粒，其形狀則呈四角柱狀。
靠近界面的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 經 EPMA 分析後則發現，其組成與仍附著於界面上的
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 組成非常接近。這表示那些靠近界面的橄欖狀(Cu,Ni)6Sn5，早先可能
是從界面分離出去的。若廻銲時間拉長至 20 分鐘，則(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 就會完全取代
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5，而成為界面上唯一的連續層。而原本在界面上的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5，此時
幾乎全部 spalling 進銲料內部，如圖 17 (f)所示。此結果與上述 300 μm 的
Sn3Ag0.6Cu 銲錫球的結果相似，但(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 變得比較少且分布較為稀疏，不
似 Sn3Ag0.6Cu 之(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 的緊密分布，参閱圖 17 (C)。 
 
4.2.3 Sn3Ag0.4Cu 的銲錫球 
在大銲錫球(直徑 760 及 500 μm)中，Cu 濃度從 0.5 wt.%降低至 0.4 wt.%時，
介金屬會由(Cu,Ni)6Sn5轉變成(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 及(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 並存，如圖 16 (g)-(h)。值
得注意的是，兩層介金屬間會有孔洞生成，且隨著銲點縮小，孔洞會變大。這意
味著隨著銲點的縮小，(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 亦有剝離的趨勢。若銲點直徑縮小至 300 μm
時，此時(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 甚至完全取代原本的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5，在界面形成連續層。另外
零星的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 則存在於近界面處，参閱圖 16 (i)。若廻銲時間拉長至 20 分鐘，
介金屬將逐漸增厚，但介金屬的組成則不會隨著廻銲時間拉長而發生改變。参閱
圖 17 (g)-(i)。圖 19 為圖 17 (g)的 BSE 放大圖，由圖 19 可明顯看出有一層白色
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 存在於 Ni 與(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 之間。 
 
 
 
 
 
28 
 
降，則可由 Cu mass balance 的關係推得: 
 
 
其中 wCu 及 wcu 表示銲接前後 SnAgCu 銲料中的 Cu 濃度(wt.%)。djoint為銲點的直
徑，dpad 則為墊層開孔大小。而 Sn3Ag(0.4-0.6)Cu 的密度由本研究測得約 7.4 
g/cm
3。(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 及(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 的密度則為 8.28 及 8.65 g/cm
3
 [44]。在 Cu 濃度
範圍為 0.4-0.6 wt.%時，(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 及(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 的組成經由 EPMA 分析，約為
(Cu0.60Ni0.40)6Sn5 及(Ni0.80Cu0.20)3Sn4，参閱表一。然而由於(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 的厚度很
薄，並且(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 中的溶 Cu 量也很少(約 6.1 wt.%)。所以在此，本研究特將
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 生成時所消耗的 Cu 忽略不計。而在實際應用上，銲錫球直徑與墊層
開孔大小的比值(djoint/dpad)約在 1-1.3 間。因此 eq.(1)即可簡化成 eq.(2): 
 
 
 
由 eq.(2)可知，銲料中 Cu 濃度的變化與銲錫球的直徑是成反比的關係。在
圖 4 (c)中，300 μm 的 Sn3Ag0.6Cu 與開孔 375 μm 的 Ni 墊層反應，生成約
的介金屬。其 Cu 濃度經 eq.(2)的推估，可知反應前後濃度竟下降了 0.4 wt.%之
多。也難怪原本穩定存在於界面的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5會變得不穩定而脫離了界面。 
圖 21 則是顯示若銲錫球直徑與墊層開孔大小的比值(djoint/dpad)為 1 時，界面
生成(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 與銲點之 Cu 濃度的變化關係。由圖 21 可知，銲點體積不斷縮
小時，Cu 濃度的變化會越來越大。在 BGA 尺寸的銲錫球中，1 μm 的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5
生成時，Cu 濃度僅會下降 0.05 wt.%。但在 flip-chip 尺寸下，當有 1 μm 的
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 就可能造成 Cu 濃度下降 0.4 wt.%之多。換句話說，當使用含 0.5 wt.%
的含 Cu 銲錫球(如 Sn3Ag0.5Cu)來進行銲接時，Cu 濃度幾乎降為 0，因此界面就
會由原本的(Cu,Ni)6Sn5及(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 兩相共存轉為(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 單獨存在。據此，
體積效應對未來的影響勢將越來越大。 
本研究特採用一個 200 μm Sn4Ag0.5Cu 的 flip chip 銲點，來證實上述的說
法。圖 22 是該銲點經過頂溫 235oC，廻銲 90 秒的結果。由圖可知僅廻銲一次的
情形下，(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 (1-1.5μm)就開始脫離了界面。經由計算也可得知，此銲點
的 Cu 濃度，因有 1-1.5 μm (Cu,Ni)6Sn5，而使其 Cu 濃度由 0.5 下降至 0.3 wt.%，
迫使(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 的脫離。這也再一次顯示，在小體積的銲點下，含 Cu 介金屬的
生成會對銲料中的 Cu 濃度造成巨幅的波動。 
介金屬的 spalling 對銲點可靠度的影響，可由本研究室的早期文獻[45]得知。
圖 23 (b)是經過固態熱處理後，原本剝離的(Cu,Au,Ni)6Sn5 [如圖 10 (a)]會逐漸回
到界面，生長在(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 上，同時產生一排的孔洞在(Cu,Au,Ni)6Sn5 與銲料之
間。這是由於夾在(Cu,Au,Ni)6Sn5 與(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 中間的銲料被消耗殆盡的結果。

4.3.3 高溫熱儲藏之特性觀察 
 
    由於 SA 及 SC 銲料之溶點為 220–230 ℃，固 200 ℃為相當嚴峻的固態反應
之熱儲藏條件，其大量加速了固態反應的擴散速率。根據 Arrhenius equation，錫
在 200 ℃的自擴散約為在 150 ℃的 23 倍[50]。圖 29 為網狀之 Ti2Sn3 析出於銲
料母相之放大圖，第一直行顯示各個組成在熱儲存處理前之截面圖。而在 200
度熱處理後，Ti2Sn3 仍相當穩定，並無粗化或成長的現象，即使時間超過 100 小
時。然而，共晶相卻在熱處理後粗化和凝聚在一起，見圖 29(m)–(p)之趨勢。在
圖 29(p)中，較暗之顆粒為 Ti2Sn3 而較亮者為隨熱處理時間增長逐漸粗大化之
SnCuTi 共晶相。 
    雖然共晶相隨熱處理時間增加而粗化，然而 β-Sn 的生長卻會被 Ti2Sn3 之網
狀結構所抑制，在我們之前的研究中，在 200 ℃熱處理八小時後，β-Sn 晶粒及
樹枝狀晶之生長相當顯著，而本研究則顯示 β-Sn 之平均大小再經過 100 小時熱
處理後仍然不變。由此，我們可以得到 Sn 的擴散會受到微量的鈦添加而被抑制，
此結果也意味著 Ti 將會是一個提升抗電遷移能力的微添加候選人。而電遷移抵
抗能力是在高效能之銲錫接點所關心的重要議題。 
     圖 30 顯示出 Sn–Ag 為主體及 Sn–Cu 為主體銲料的微硬度隨著熱處理時間
變化的關係圖。其結果與微觀組織中，Ti 添加能在嚴峻的熱處理條件下有效的穩
定銲料微觀組織之結果並不矛盾。於熱處理初期 Sn–Ag 銲料的硬度上升是由於
過飽和的 Ag析出形成網狀的 Ag3Sn 介金屬結構。隨著熱處理時間增加，純 Sn–Ag
銲料之硬度會快速下降，而 Ti 添加之 Sn-Ag 銲料並無此情形。Sn-Cu 之熱處理
方面，與純 Sn-Cu 做比較，微添加鈦亦顯示出其硬度之穩定性。

In this work, we investigate the intermetallic compound formation in Cu wire bonded device. Voids near
the Cu side at the bond interface are clearly seen. Nevertheless, these voids do not seem to interfere with
the function of the unit. High temperature storage test (HTST) results show that there are Al2Cu and AlCu
in the damaged unit while Al2Cu and Al4Cu9 appear in the good unit. The results clearly show that the Al
layer is exhausted in the damaged unit while those with Al4Cu9 on the Cu side pass HTST with uncon-
sumed Al. Theoretical calculations indicate that AlCu and Al4Cu9 are energetically more favorable than
Al2Cu, which is consistent with the reported IMC forming sequence. Formation energy of AlCu is compat-
ible but slightly lower to that of Al4Cu9, suggesting AlCu tends to be the most stable phase among all. The
reason why the Al layer is completely consumed in one case and some Al layer remains in the other is due
to the fact that the formation of AlCu requires more than twice the amount of Al than Al4Cu9 for the same
amount of Cu consumed. The complete consumption of Al is proposed as the reason responsible for the
failure of the damaged unit.

1. Introduction
Wire bonding has long been one of the mainstream technolo-
gies in electronic packaging. The electrical connectivity is achieved
by melting the wire tip to form a free air ball (FAB), then thermo-
sonically welding the FAB onto Al or Cu metallization pad on the
chip, followed by wire looping and stitch bonding on a substrate
ﬁnger pad. Compared with conventional Au wire, the use of Cu
wire for thermosonic wire bonding presents several advantages,
including signiﬁcant cost saving and enhanced electrical and
thermal conductivity [1]. On account of the soaring price of Au in
recent years, enormous efforts have been devoted in the electronic
packaging industry to replacing Au by Cu wire. However, technical
issues such as the need and control of forming gas during FAB for-
mation [2–13], underpad damage caused by the much stiffer FAB
[2,13–15], Al pad splash that may lead to short circuit in ﬁne-pitch
applications as well as degraded reliability [2,13,16,17], slow Al–
Cu intermetallic compound (IMC) formation and growth [3,18–
34], and long-term reliability under humid environments
[7,10,18,22,28,35,36] have been considered as signiﬁcant technical
challenges for Cu wire bonding.
In the FAB formation, forming gas is essential to prevent oxida-
tion of Cu [6], which features a low oxidation reduction potential
(OPR), or otherwise the Cu oxides would potentially block the
interdiffusion between Al and Cu that constitutes bondability. Ow-
ing to the high yield stress of Cu, more serious process control is
needed to prevent Al pad and underpad from damaging during
bonding. This is particularly important for ﬁne-pitch and low-k
dielectric devices. Efforts have been seen in pulling in discrepancy
in stiffness between Cu wire and Al pad through micro-dopants or
process control. Mechanical strengthening of Al pad is usually
achieved by impurity doping of 1%Si [2,3,23], 0.5–4%Cu [11,28],
or 1%Si–0.5%Cu [3,20,22,26,30]. On the other hand, stiffness of Cu
wire and FAB can be lowered by using annealed [35], high-purity
[16], or micro-doped wire [14], and through an adequate electronic
ﬂame-off (EFO) process [13,37]. The IMC formed in the bonding
process concerns with the wire bondability and mechanical reli-
ability, and the IMC formation and growth are greatly affected by
the process parameters including bond force, heat, and ultrasonic
energy. The growth rate of Al–Cu IMCs is approximately one tenth
that of Al–Au IMCs in the temperature range between 150 and
300 C [20]. The ease of oxidation and corrosion of Cu intuitively
puts long-term reliability of Cu wire bonding in risk in a humid
environment. Whether Cu corrosion is enhanced by ionic impurity
in mold compound in a humid environment is still in dispute
[18,28,35,36], but notably the Pd-coated Cu wire has been shown
to effectively retard Cu corrosion [7,10].
Among the many technical issues of Cu wire bonding men-
tioned above, the formation and growth of Al–Cu IMCs are of par-
ticular interests. Signiﬁcantly different from the comprehensive

Earlier studies on the Al–Cu diffusion couple have conﬁrmed
that the h-Al2Cu is the ﬁrst compound nucleating at the Al–Cu
interface. However, contradictory ﬁndings in subsequent Al–Cu
phase formation, either c-Al4Cu9 or g-AlCu being the main phase,
vary among researchers [38,39]. This issue remains open in the
IMC formation in Al–Cu wire bonding. From the Al–Cu phase dia-
gram, at the temperature range of wire bonding, possible IMCs that
could initiate include Al4Cu9 [22,30], Al2Cu3 [25], Al3Cu4, AlCu
[18,22], and Al2Cu [18]. Further studies identiﬁed that Al2Cu is
the ﬁrst nucleus at the bond interface [17,33], and Premkumar et
al. [17] claimed that this nucleus becomes Al4Cu9 or AlCu as the
purity of Cu wire increases. Analyses of thermally annealed sam-
ples indicated that from Al to Cu there are sequentially AlCu,
Al4Cu9, and Al2Cu3 [27], Al2Cu and AlCu [29], or Al2Cu, AlCu, and
Al4Cu9 [30] IMC layers.The h-Al2Cu, crystallized in tetragonal sym-
metry within space group I4/mcm, is the most widely studied in
the phase precipitation sequence of the Al–Cu alloy system [40].
Each Cu atom in Al2Cu is surrounded by eight Al atoms situated
at the corners of an Archimedean square antiprism, and has two
Cu atoms at a distance of c/2, forming linear chains. The electronic
structure of c-Al4Cu9 (cubic, space group P 43 m) was determined
by Westman and coworkers [41,42], which can be described by
clusters of 52 atoms (16 and 36 for Al and Cu, respectively) located
on a body-centered cubic lattice. The lowest symmetry in the Al–
Cu alloy system is AlCu, which belongs to a monoclinic system
with a total of 20 atoms within the conventional unit cell. Fig. 4
shows the prescribed Al–Cu crystalline usually encountered in Cu
wire bond application.
3. Discussions
The ab-inito calculation is an effective way to reveal the cohe-
sive properties for these IMCs involved in solidiﬁcation process,
in particular when the species are difﬁcult to be identiﬁed from
conventional experimental approaches. Signiﬁcant studies on
cohesive properties of the Sn–Cu alloy system were reported
[43–45]. For the Al–Cu alloy system, elastic properties of Al2Cu,
Al3Cu2, AlCu, and AlCu3 were examined by Zhou et al. [46]. The
equilibrium formation energy of a compound can be determined
from the total energy of the AlpCuq compound, taken with respect
to the equivalent amounts of Al and Cu constituents in their equi-
librium crystal structures:
pAlðf:c:c:Þ þ qCuðf :c:c:Þ ! AlCuq ð1Þ
Energies per atom of the Al–Cu IMCs and their constituents are
relaxed to their equilibrium geometry. Total energy calculations
are based on the density functional theory [47] within the general-
ized-gradient approximation (GGA) based on the ‘‘Vienna ab initio
simulations package” (VASP) [48]. The projector augmented wave

the idea that the OSP layer is supposed to behave as a protective layer
from oxidation. Besides, it is noteworthy that the conjectured oxida-
tion mechanisms at this low temperature differ amongst the authors.
Clearly, the direct correlation between the oxide thickness and de-
tailed structure of the layer is not completely explained, particularly
in Cu-OSP.
This paper focuses on the oxidation of Cu-OSP from the thin to
thick ﬁlm stage. The objective is to determine the critical oxide thick-
ness of a copper substrate for soldering, thereby providing referenced
oxide data for the assembly process and a different approach to mea-
sure oxide thickness directly. The kinetics of oxidation processes,
mechanism of oxide growth, and surface topographical evolutions
will be presented.
2. Experimental procedures
Ball Grid Array substrates were used in this study. Sampled sub-
strates consisted of 225 copper pads with 0.3 mm pad diameter and
0.35 mm pad pitch. Copper pads were electro-chemically plated
with a purity of 99.9% weight of copper. These pads were coated
with a 100 nm commercial imidazole layer (Entek® Plus Cu-106A
supplied by Tamura Kaken Co. Ltd. Japan) as an OSP. The Cu substrate
was ﬁrst cleaned by ethanol, followed by micro etch using 5% sulfuric
acid (H2SO4) to enhance the surface roughness for OSP coating. After
micro-etch, the substrates were rinsed by water and dipped into
Entek Plus Cu-106A bath. The OSP coated substrates were then rinsed
with distilled water and dried.
The OSP coated substrates were then baked at 150 °C and 85% rel-
ative humidity (RH) for 168 h. Every 12 h, a few of substrates were
taken out for surface analysis. Oxide depth proﬁle was performed by
Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) with a
low energy Bi primary beam of 25 kV. Substrates were sputtered
with Cs+ ion at 193 kJ mol−1 energy and 1.3×10−4 Pa vacuum
level. The specimens were tilted at 30° angle and scanned for an esti-
mated 70 μm2 area. The sputtering rate was approximately 2.2 nm
per 20 s, calibrated by using a silica sample [34]. Sputtering time
was set at 880 s. The secondary ion cluster CsX− was then analyzed.
Bright Field Transmission Electron Microscopy (BF-TEM, JEOL JEM-
2100 F) was used to correlate to the estimated oxide thickness
based on the sputtering rate.
The different pre-baked Cu-OSP substrates were printed with a
water-soluble ﬂux. Sn3.5Ag0.5Cu solder balls with 0.3 mm diameter
were placed on the Cu pads. Soldered substrates were then reﬂowed
at peak temperature of 245 °C; with time above liquidus of 60 s and
the ambient oven was controlled below 20 O2 ppm. Upon solidiﬁca-
tion, the solder balls were sheared off using Dage-4000. Fracture in-
terfaces of the solder joint were checked as to verify the non-
wetting mode. The percentage of non-wetting solder joint was then
calculated. For the onset of non-wetting solder joint, the pre-baked
bare Cu-OSP substrates were analyzed using Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) at an operating volt-
age of 15 kV for secondary micrographs. This FE-SEM was equipped
with Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and the elemental
mapping was performed at 5 kV using EDX. Thickness and surface to-
pography of oxide were further studied in details by using TEM oper-
ated at 200 kV. The surface roughness (Ra) was then measured using
Wyko NT9100.
For TEM sample preparation, a layer of silica was coated to the
specimen to protect the oxide layer using direct-write chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) technique [35]. Oxygen and siloxane
(Tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Si4O4C4H16) were used as chemi-
cal precursors and guided to a small region for TEM analysis. A Fo-
cused Ion Beam (FIB) of Ga+ ion with 50 kV was introduced to
provide the necessary energy for CVD. While silicon oxide was de-
posited onto a small area, its thickness was inspected in-situ by

given as
X–Co ¼ Bln tð Þ ð2Þ
where B is the rate constant of oxidation with calculated value of
5.56×10−14 cm2 min−1.
3.2. The topographic and structural Cu oxide evolutions
Fig. 4 is the cross-sectioned layer of the Cu-OSP with thickness of
about 100 nm. In this ﬁgure, the OSP thickness was non-uniform.
The as-plated Cu-OSP pad Ra was about 0.4 μm. EDX detected both
copper and oxygen spectra on the substrate pad surface. The results
indicated that copper and oxygen were inter-diffused. Fig. 5 shows
the EDX mapping of the Cu-OSP substrate pad baked for 3 h. The
dark region represents the Cu, and the white region is the oxygen in-
tensity. Higher oxygen content is found on the thinner side of the OSP
layer, suggesting a higher oxidation rate occurred on the thinner side
of the OSP layer.
Fig. 6 shows the topographical evolution as a function of baked
hours. The native oxide thickness was about 3 nm thick. However,
the subsequent growth of the oxide thickness was non-uniform. The
thicker oxide region appeared as white spots due to different con-
trasts and surface roughnesses. These white spots continued to
grow as ridges. Subsequently, they coalesced after long hours of bak-
ing. Similar observations were reported by Yang et al. [14,15] and
Hajcsar et al. [37]. After 168 h of baking, the substrate's Ra was
about 0.33 μm, which was smoother compared to the initial Ra of
0.42 μm. These results revealed that the surface roughness had been
smoothened by continuous oxidation. Gao et al. [31] and Honkanen
et al. [32] published the identical observation of oxide grain rough-
ness using Atomic Focus Microscopy.
As shown in Fig. 6(d), a small rectangular area was cross-sectioned
for TEM analysis. Fig. 7 is the BF-TEM micrograph showing a double-
layer formation in the Cu substrate. The interface layer was about 6
to 7 nm thick and included copper, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.
Since carbon and nitrogen were detected, the interface layer was de-
duced to be an imidazole compound of OSP. However, the presence
of copper and oxygen in the OSP layer conﬁrmed that inter-diffusion
had occurred. The OSP layer had been thinned down from about
100 nm initially to 6 to 7 nm after 36 h of baking. The outer layer
was identiﬁed as Cu2O by using EDX. The results supported early re-
search [19–23,28–35,37] showing that at low temperature oxidation
(b200 °C) Cu2O was formed. Copper (II) Oxide (CuO) was only found
at intermediate (600–850 °C) to higher (900–1050 °C) oxidation tem-
perature and oxygen pressures [29,30,36].
BF-TEM reveals that the oxide thickness was non-uniform, ranging
from 11.9 nm to 32.5 nm, even within a small area of interest. The av-
erage oxide thickness was 18.6 nm. This data was closely matched to
the 18 nm thickness from the ToF-SIMS sputtered rate. Thus, both
analysis tools were well correlated. Several pores were observed
within the oxide layer. In addition, surface chipping was found on
the top surface due to sample preparation. Fig. 8 shows a thick
oxide ﬁlm on a copper pad after baking at 150 °C and 85% RH for
168 h. The oxide thickness ranged from 0.35 μm to 0.56 μm. The OSP
layer had been completely decomposed to a Cu oxide layer and inter-
facial voids, whose sizes ranged from 20 nm to 193 nm. The ratio of
the pore size to the oxide thickness was in the range of 0.31–0.69,
which was relatively large.
4. Discussion
4.1. Effects of oxide on solder joint and its kinetic growth
The growth of copper oxide thickness follows the parabolic law
with a good R2 regression coefﬁcient of 95%. We tested the inverse
logarithmic rate possibility, but the resulting R2 was 77%, indicating
poor correlation. However, the direct logarithmic rate ﬁts well in
the thin oxide regimeb12 nm with an R2 of 99%. Zhong et al.

oxidation energy, respectively. The parameter μ depends on the prop-
erties of the oxide. Based on the Einstein diffusion equation [10,28]
A ¼ A0exp −ΔH=kTð Þ ð4Þ
Cabrera and Mott's [10] diffusion model states that
A0 ¼ 2DΩη ð5Þ
whereΩ is the volume of the oxide per Cu ion,D is the diffusivity or dif-
fusion coefﬁcient for Cu ions, and η is the concentration of the dissolved
Cu ions and electrons at the interface between O2-Cu2O/OSP-Cu. ΔH is
the effective activation energy for oxidation [2,29] that relates to the
standard thermodynamic equation [2,28]
ΔH ¼ ΔGþ TΔS ð6Þ
where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy, and ΔS is the entropy that relates to
the sticking probability. The oxidation of metal involves several com-
plex stages [6,7,10], including physical adsorption, chemisorption, nu-
clei formation, and nucleus growth. The sticking probability is the
measure of the gas-metal interactions, which result from the dissocia-
tive chemisorption and desorption of the oxygen molecules
[12,41,42]. For example, at a temperature of 330 K, the sticking proba-
bility of Cu(110) is 0.25 at the impinging energy of 4.82 kJ mol−1
(0.05 eV). Finally, depending on the properties of the oxide, the defects
in the oxide, such as pores, can short-circuit the diffusion path and pro-
mote oxidation. Such diffusion properties relate to the μ parameter.
These complex relations can be further simpliﬁed to the parabolic
equation, Eq. (1), based on Mott's theory [6,10]. Thus, to predict a
good solder joint formation in the assembly, one can set the initial
oxide thickness (C0) to be 3 nm and the maximum oxide thickness
(X) to be 13 nm. From Eq. (1)
X−C0ð Þ2 ¼ 2At
50nm2 ¼ At
The rate constant can be determined based on Fig. 3a. Both A and t
will change at different experimental settings or assembly conditions.
Thus, it is necessary to identify the rate constant ﬁrst. Once these set-
tings are ﬁxed, the parameters (t) can be calculated accordingly.
4.2. The topographic and structural Cu oxide evolutions
The oxide is identiﬁed as Cu2O and a bi-layer of Cu2O-OSP is found on
baking. But, the coated OSP layer on Cu substrate is non-uniform (Fig. 5.)
This organic layer is thinner at the edge of the copper grain. Higher cop-
per and oxygen inter-diffusion occurs at the thinner layer. A thick oxide
layer, shown as white spots on EDX images, is observed on Cu-OSP pad
after baking. These spotsmerge as ridges as baking increased. The surface
roughness is smoothened from 0.42 μm initially to 0.33 μm after long
baking hours (Fig. 7.) The results demonstrate that oxidation modiﬁes
the Cu pad surface roughness due to the coalescences of the oxide ridges.
Gao et al. [31] and Honkanen et al. [32] suggested forming oxide of com-
pact and ﬁne grain to minimize further oxidation.
At prolonged baking, the OSP layer decomposes to Cu2O-OSP bi-
layers structure. The bi-layer is non-uniform. Pores are found inside
the oxide layer (Figs. 7 and 8). The ratio of the pore diameter to
oxide thickness is ranged from 0.31 to 0.69. This is relatively high
value. These pores can short-circuit the diffusion path and allow faster

Cu+ and O2− are interdiffused through the OSP layer. They react to each other to produce a native oxide layer of about 3 nm. (b) After 12 h of baking, the Cu2O ridges coalesce. The
OSP layer decomposes slowly, while Cu oxide layer grows with baking time. (c) After 36 h of baking, the oxide ridges coalesce and produce a rough topography of surface. At this
juncture, nano voids are formed. The OSP layer is thinning with baking time. (d) After 168 h of baking, the roughness of the substrate surface has been smoothened, and the OSP
layer decomposes completely. Large interfacial voids are formed.

This  article  reports  on the  highly  interesting  microstructural  evolution  from  a ﬁne  eutectic  to  a coarse
laminar  pattern  caused  by  the  cycling  thermomechanical  stress  in  eutectic  PbSn  ﬂip-chip  solder  joints.
The  temperature  was  cycled  between  −55  and  125 ◦C  for  up to  2000  cycles.  The  shear  strain  on  the  corners
joints,  which  experienced  the  maximum  thermomechanical  stress  among  all the  solder  joints  in  a  ﬂip-
chip  package,  was  estimated  to be 0.13  for  each  cycle.  A  coarse  laminar  pattern,  made  up  of  the  Pb-rich
phase  and  the  Sn-rich  phase,  gradually  developed  during  the  temperature  cycling  with  phase  boundaries
that  were  approximately  parallel  to the direction  of  the  shear  stress.  It  is argued  that  the  laminar  pattern

1. Introduction
In low-cost ﬂip-chip technology, organic chip-carrier substrates
have almost completely replaced ceramic substrates because of
their substantial cost advantages over their ceramic counterparts.
It is estimated that 99% of the ﬂip-chip packages produced today
employ some type of organic substrate. Ceramic substrates are
still used only in highly critical applications such as for aerospace
and military uses. However, organic substrates present one major
drawback, which is the large mismatch in the coefﬁcients of ther-
mal  expansion between silicon and organic substrates [1].  Such a
mismatch makes ﬂip-chip packages particularly prone to thermo-
mechanical fatigue [2–5]. A temperature cycling test (TCT) is the
main tool used to identify package schemes that are susceptible to
failure due to thermomechanical fatigue.
In the literature, the mechanism of failure due to thermome-
chanical fatigue has been described in detail [6].  The objective of
this study is to investigate the microstructural evolution that takes
place during the time leading up to actual failure. In other words,
we investigate the microstructural changes that arise in response to
thermomechanical stress. More speciﬁcally, the highly interesting
microstructural evolution from a ﬁne eutectic to a coarse laminar
pattern is reported and discussed.

2. Experimental
A schematic drawing of the die and the organic substrate used in this study is
shown in Fig. 1(a). The detailed layout of each solder joint is shown schematically
in  Fig. 1(b). On the chip side, an outer under-bump-metallization (UBM) layer com-
posed of 3 m of Ni was in direct contact with the eutectic 37Pb63Sn (wt.%, same
below) solder bump which had a nominal diameter of 94 m.  The top metal layer
on  the soldering pads was electroplated Cu.
The dies and substrates were assembled by reﬂow. The reﬂow time, during
which the solder was molten, was 115 s. The peak reﬂow temperature was 240
(±2) ◦C. The nominal ramp and cooling rates were both 1.5 ◦C s−1.  After assembly,
the  specimens underwent high temperature annealing at 100 ◦C for 200 h in order to
pre-condition them. The purpose of this pre-conditioning treatment was to homog-
enize the microstructure of the solder joints so that all joints would possess a similar
initial microstructure.
The ﬂip-chip packages were then subjected to a temperature cycling test. The
temperature proﬁle for each cycle consisted of a 15 min  ramp-up from −55 to
125 ◦C, a 15 min  constant temperature of 125 ◦C, a 15 min  ramp-down from 125
to  −55 ◦C, and a 15 min  constant temperature of −55 ◦C. Taking into account the
coefﬁcients of thermal expansion for Si (2.6 × 10−6 K−1) and for the organic sub-
strate (15 × 10−6 K−1) [1],  we  calculated that the temperature difference between
the  high dwell temperature (125 ◦C) and the low dwell temperature (−55 ◦C) gen-
erated a maximum displacement of 12.6 m between the two  corner joints along
the  diagonal direction of the die, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). This displacement value
translated into a maximum apparent shear strain of 12.6/94 = 0.13 for the corner
joints. The corresponding thermal stress must have surpassed the yield stress of the
eutectic PbSn because extensive plastic deformation was observed in the joints.
In  order to observe their microstructural evolution, some of the ﬂip-chip pack-
ages were cross-sectioned along the centers of the ﬁrst-row solder joints. These
packages then underwent a TCT for a speciﬁc number of cycles, after which they were
examined under an electron microscope. After observation, these same packages
were subjected to further TCTs and subsequent observation. This kind of treatment
is  referred to as in situ TCT in this article.
After these TCT cycles, the specimens were mounted in epoxy and metal-
lographically polished to reveal the interface and the internal microstructure.

coarse laminar pattern. This coarse laminar pattern, made up of the
Pb-rich phase (white regions) and the Sn-rich phase (gray regions),
developed gradually during the temperature cycling and became
quite apparent after 1500 cycles. The laminar pattern was horizon-
tal with a thickness that ranged from 5 to 20 m.  During the early
stage (<100 cycles) of TCT, the development of the laminar pattern
was not apparent. A comparison between Figs. 2(b) and 3(a)–(c)
reveals that during this early stage of TCT, grain coarsening was  the
only apparent microstructural development. This coarsening pro-
cess continued throughout the TCT cycles, and the combined action
of the grain coarsening and the shear stress resulting from the mis-
match in the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion created this unique
coarse laminar pattern.
In order to understand the three-dimensional morphology of
the laminar pattern, the joint shown in Fig. 3(m)  was subjected
to a second cross-sectioning along a plane perpendicular to the
ﬁrst cross-section, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The
microstructure from this second cross-section is shown in Fig. 4(b).
A laminar pattern was also clearly visible along this direction. The
fact that the laminar pattern was  present in both directions sug-
gests that the morphology of the Pb-rich regions was in the form
of thin plate, instead of in the form of horizontal cylinder.
It should be noted that this laminar pattern formed in the cor-
ner bumps (bumps 1 and 36) and in the central bump (bump 18),
despite the difference in maximum shear strain developed during
each cycle (0.13 versus 0.095). Apparently, the shear strain that the
center bump experienced was sufﬁciently strong to produce the
laminar pattern. There was  difference, however, in the angle of tilt
of the laminar pattern. The laminar pattern for the central bump
after 2000 cycles, shown in Fig. 3(n), was more or less horizon-
tal, but the laminar patters for the left and the right corner bumps,
shown in Fig. 3(m)  and (o), exhibited tilt approximately in the −45◦

microstructure. Fig. 5(d)–(i) shows the microstructural evolution
during in situ TCT after 100 and 500 cycles for bump 1, 18, and 36,
respectively. The micrographs in each column represent the same
solder joint after different numbers of cycles. During TCT, clear dif-
ferences developed between bumps 1, 18, and 36. The center bump
(bump 18) developed a horizontal crack, as shown in Fig. 5(e) and
(h). In contrast, bump 1 developed a diagonal crack from the upper-
right to the lower-left corner, as shown in Fig. 4(d) and (g). In bump
36, a diagonal crack from the upper-left to the lower-right corner
can be seen, as shown in Fig. 5(f) and (i). The different directions
of the cracks were merely a reﬂection/expression of the direction
of the thermomechanical stress. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the central
bumps experienced stress only in the y direction, but the corner
bumps experienced stress in both the x and y directions.
These cracks were clearly due to thermomechanical stress dur-
ing TCT and were primarily propagated along the boundaries
between the Sn-rich and Pb-rich phase. One could also observe that
a small amount of solder was extruded from the surface. In actual
solder joints, in which the joints are covered by underﬁll, such pro-
trusion would not occur, as these protrusions were artifacts caused
by the free surface created for in situ observation. As 37Pb63Sn is
a relatively soft material and cracks was rarely reported in litera-
ture during TCT test, the observation of cracks here suggests that
the thermomechanical stress was indeed very large in electronic
packages used in this study.
It should be pointed out that during regular TCT observation, no
cracks at all were observed, even after 2000 cycles. Cracks devel-
oped during in situ TCT observation at a much earlier stage because
the joints were not protected by underﬁll on the top surface. In
addition, these in situ joints had been cross-sectioned by one half;
therefore, there was only half as much material in each joint to
absorb the stress energy.
4. Summary
The effect of thermomechanical stress on ﬂip-chip 37Pb63Sn
solder joints was studied. The thermomechanical stress trans-
formed the microstructure from a ﬁne eutectic to a coarse laminar
pattern. The shear strain on the corners joints, which experienced
the maximum thermomechanical stress among all the solder joints
in a ﬂip-chip package, was estimated to be 0.13 for each cycle. The
direction of the laminar pattern was  parallel to the direction of the
shear stress. It is argued that the laminar pattern had developed
in such a manner that the material with the lowest yield stress
(the Pb-rich phase) could align itself with the direction of the shear
stress. Because a continuous soft layer was  arranged in a direction
parallel to that of the shear stress, the stored deformation energy
could be dissipated more efﬁciently. It should be pointed out that
this proposition concerns only with why  the alloy arrived at such a
microstructure Nevertheless, no mechanism was  clear at this stage
concerning how did this occur. The detailed mechanism for this
microstructural evolution remains unknown. Additional purposely
designed experiments are needed to uncover the responsible mech-
anism for this highly interesting microstructure.

2. Experimental procedures
Two  binary Sn-rich solders are chosen as the master alloys: Sn–1.0Ag (wt.%) (SA)
and  Sn–0.7Cu (wt.%) (SC). Different amounts of Ti were added into SA and SC, produc-
ing four different Ti-bearing alloys with the following compositions: Sn–1.0Ag–0.2Ti
(SA0.2Ti), Sn–1.0Ag–0.6Ti (SA0.6Ti), Sn–0.7Cu–0.2Ti (SC0.2Ti), and Sn–0.7Cu–0.6Ti
(SC0.6Ti). Some solder samples were also produced in the form of small solder cylin-
ders  by the method of injection molded solder (IMS) [19]. The solder cylinders have
a  diameter of 294 m (12 mil) and a length of 381 m (15 mil).
Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was  employed to reveal intrinsic ther-
mal  behavior. During DSC measurements, solders of approximate 5 mg weight
were heated up and cooled down at a constant rate of 6 ◦C/min under a nitro-
gen  atmosphere. By observing the endothermic and exothermic heat ﬂows, the
melting and solidiﬁcation behaviors as well as the undercooling were analyzed.
Undercooling is one of the important features that affect the reliability of sol-
der joints by causing non-uniform solidiﬁcation among many neighboring solder
joints.
To  investigate the effect of cooling rates on microstructure, three cooling rates
were used: furnace-cooling, air cooling and water-quenching. The solders were
molten at 250 ◦C for 10 min  under a nitrogen atmosphere and then subjected
to  furnace-cooling, air-cooling or water-quenching afterward. Optical microscopy
(OM) was  employed to produce both bright ﬁeld and cross-polarized images for
microstructure information.
Vickers hardness (VH) data were obtained by using 5 g force and 5 s dwell time
on  well-polished surface of solders. Each VH value in this paper was reported as an
average of at least 20 indentations.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Melting, solidiﬁcation and undercooling of Ti-alloyed solders
Vertices in DSC data signify local-strongest heat ﬂows and
indicate phase transitions occurring during the heating and cool-
ing cycles as shown in Fig. 1. The valleys in a heating curve of
DSC stand for intense endothermic phase transitions (melting)
whereas the peaks in a cooling procedure represent strong exother-
mal  phase transitions (solidiﬁcation). Due to the overlap between
eutectic and -Sn vertices in DSC, the onset temperature is dif-
ﬁcult to be obtained precisely, therefore the peak temperatures
were employed in this study. The values in Table 1 are the peak
temperatures for each vertex, showing a collection of DSC  data.
Inspecting the undercooling of four solders, it is found that minor
Ti addition effectively reduces the amount of the undercooling of
Sn-rich solders, and more Ti addition can only slightly reduce the
undercooling further. This result is quite consistent with the expla-
nation proposed by Cho et al. [20] that alloying elements with a
hexagonal closed packed (hcp) structure may  enhance the hetero-
geneous nucleation of -Sn and thereby reducing its undercooling.
Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows the melting and freezing DSC data of
Ag-containing solders, respectively. One may  notice that, during
heating, Fig. 1(a) shows that there are two  valleys in each Ag-
containing solder. The two valleys are found to be associated with
the melting heat ﬂows coming from eutectic Sn–Ag and -Sn,

function of cooling rate and Ti concentration. OM bright ﬁled and
cross-polarized images are employed to analyze the microstruc-
ture of -Sn grains and -Sn dendrites. OM bright ﬁeld images
can reveal both grain boundaries and dendrite cell boundaries, but
cannot distinguish them. However, cross-polarized images can tell
different grain orientations and deﬁne grain boundaries, as shown
in the upper-right inserts of each condition in Figs. 2 and 3.
Fig. 2 shows the microstructure of SA0.2Ti and SA0.6Ti sol-
ders. According to energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS), the
darker contrast precipitates and the dense phase in between -Sn
were identiﬁed as Ti2Sn3 and SnAgTi eutectic, respectively. Fig. 2(a)
shows that, besides shrinking -Sn grain size, water-quenching had
Ti2Sn3 intermetallics dispersed randomly inside the solder. The
solder was water-quenched so rapidly that Ti2Sn3 particles were
frozen and kept dispersive similarly as in molten solder. In the case
of slower cooling, such as air- and furnace-cooling, as shown in
Fig. 2(b) and (c), Ti2Sn3 were found near the bottom side of the sol-
der which was  directly in contact with a glass substrate. Because
of high heat conduction, the solidiﬁcation would start at the glass
substrate. Fig. 4 shows the reaction schemes drawn for Ti alloyed
Sn–Ag and Sn–Cu [21,22] solders based on the liquidus surface
for primary solidiﬁcation. According to Fig. 4(a), even though the
Sn–Ag–Ti solder matrix is molten under 250 ◦C reﬂow, Ti2Sn3 seg-
regates as solid precipitates. That is, Ti2Sn3 will form prior to the
solidiﬁcation of Sn–Ag–Ti and tend to congregate at the lower tem-
perature area during solidiﬁcation. In this case, Ti2Sn3 moved to the
bottom part owing to the lower temperature and being jostled to
-Sn grain boundaries or dendrite cell boundaries. It is worth not-
ing that the density of Ti2Sn3 is 7.184 g/cm3 according to Kleinke
et al. [23] and the density of molten Sn solder near melting point
is about 6.99 g/cm3 [24]. Thus, the density variation is quite small
and its effect on the distribution of Ti2Sn3 in molten Sn would be
insigniﬁcant due to the effect of turbulent ﬂow in molten solder.
When the Ti concentration in solders increases to 0.6 wt.%
as shown in Fig. 2(d)–(f), the number of Ti2Sn3 precipitates
increases accordingly and they become coarser and denser. By
SEM-EDS analysis, it is found that when Ti2Sn3 particles become
coarse enough, their central composition changes into Ti6Sn5. The
alteration of Ti concentration in solder is expected to change the
chemical potential of solders and may  shift the interfacial reactions
during soldering. Further experimental study is on-going to verify
this assumption.
Shown in Fig. 3 is the bright ﬁeld and cross-polarized images
of SC0.2Ti and SC0.6Ti. The major inﬂuence of cooling rates on
Sn–Cu–Ti and Sn–Ag–Ti are very similar, i.e., with a higher cool-
ing rate, -Sn will become ﬁner as well as diverse in orientations.
From a thermodynamic perspective, only minor Ti was added into
SC which is eutectic composition, so SC0.2Ti and SC0.6Ti can be
reasonably regarded as the near-eutectic composition. Compared
Sn–Cu–Ti with Sn–Ag–Ti, quantitative analyses from cross-section
images (Figs. 2 and 3) also suggest the ratio of eutectic to -Sn in
Sn–Cu–Ti is higher than in Sn–Ag–Ti. This result consists with the
fact that Sn–Cu–Ti is the near-eutectic while Sn–Ag–Ti is hypoeu-
tectic. Consequently, a higher strength or hardness is expected in
Sn–Cu–Ti due to more eutectic phases existing. This is conﬁrmed
by the microhardness test to be discussed later.
The cross-polarized inserts in Figs. 2 and 3 show that -Sn grains
in Sn–Cu–Ti are generally larger than in Sn–Ag–Ti regardless of den-
drite population. Moreover, -Sn grain orientations in Sn–Cu–Ti are
less divergent than in Sn–Ag–Ti. These results are consistent with
the previous study [4] which focused on pure SC and SA, and imply-
ing that the tendency of orientation distribution of -Sn in SC and
SA can be preserved after a minor addition of Ti.
Fig. 5 shows the microhardness results of Sn–Ag and Sn–Cu
base solders as a function of cooling condition. In general, com-
pared with Figs. 2 and 3, a faster cooling rate would produce a
ﬁner microstructure and also a higher hardness. This concept has
been well interpreted by Hall–Petch equation associated with the
dislocation theory assuming that grain boundaries act as obsta-
cles to slip dislocations. Nevertheless, pure Sn–1.0Ag seems not
to obey this rule and manifests the maximum hardness when it
was  air-cooled. This can be attributed to a higher amount of Ag3Sn
precipitates in air-cooled Sn–1.0Ag. Although the microstructure of
-Sn in air-cooled Sn–1.0Ag is coarser than in water-quenched one,
Ag3Sn which is the main contributor to hardness can fully segregate
along Sn dendrite cell boundaries as well as Sn grain boundaries,
forming abundant networks in air-cooled samples. These Ag3Sn
networks are believed to strengthen solders more efﬁciently than
the grain reﬁnement made by a faster cooling rate. In the case of
water-quenched Sn–1.0Ag, the solidiﬁcation is so fast that most Ag
atoms are supersaturated into Sn solid solution, not to diffuse out of
the solder matrix or to precipitate as Ag3Sn. Hence, the formation
of Ag3Sn networks would be greatly suppressed in this case.
Ti-added Sn–1.0Ag solders (SnAg0.2Ti and SnAg0.6Ti), however,
abide by the prediction of grain reﬁnement strengthening. This
is because, either in SnAg0.2Ti or SnAg0.6Ti, the Ti2Sn3 IMCs are
mainly responsible for hardening, not by Ag3Sn. And according to
Fig. 5. Illustration of microhardness results of (a) Sn–Ag and (b) Sn–Cu base solders undergoing different cooling conditions.

Fig. 6(m)–(p), showing the sequence of the event in SC0.6Ti during
the aging for the time up to 100 h. In Fig. 6(p), the darker particles
are Ti2Sn3 whereas the brighter ones are identiﬁed as SnCuTi IMCs
which are believed to be congregated from the eutectic phase.
Although the eutectic phase becomes coarsened during aging,
stable Ti2Sn3 networks can effectively ﬁrm the morphology of -
Sn by retarding its growth. In our previous study [4],  when pure SA
and SC were aged at 200 ◦C for 8 h, both -Sn dendrites and -Sn
grains grew remarkably. In this study, the average size of -Sn in Ti-
added solders did not change even after 100 h aging. Accordingly, it
could be claimed that the Sn diffusion is suppressed by the minor Ti
addition. And this also implies Ti-added solder may  be a good can-
didate for enhanced electro-migration resistance, which is a vital
issue in high performance solder interconnections. Experiments on
EM testing with Ti-alloyed solders are also on-going.
Fig. 7 shows the microhardness data of Sn–Ag base and Sn–Cu
base solders as a function of aging time. The results unequivocally
proved that the Ti addition can stabilize either Sn–Ag or Sn–Cu
base solders even under a severe aging condition. In Fig. 7(a), it is
worth noting that, at the initial stage of aging, the early increase in
hardness for Sn–Ag solders (not for Sn–Cu) may  be due to precip-
itation of supersaturated Ag atoms into Ag3Sn particles forming a
strong network of IMCs. As the aging time increases, a steep drop
of hardness is noticed in Sn–1.0Ag, not in the Ti-added Sn–Ag. For
the Sn–Cu solders, the hardness values are again very stable for
Ti-added solders, but not for Sn–Cu without Ti addition.
4. Conclusions
Ti additions to Sn–Cu and Sn–Ag solders can effectively reduce
the undercooling of solders, and thereby alter their microstructure
by changing the solidiﬁcation behavior. Microhardness analysis
of Sn–Cu–Ti and Sn–Ag–Ti solders conﬁrms that the faster cool-
ing speed, the ﬁner microstructure, and the higher the hardness.
However, this trend does not apply to Sn–1.0Ag where Ag3Sn pre-
cipitate network controls its major hardening. For Ti-added solders,
when exposed to a severe aging condition, although eutectic phases
become coarsened, Ti2Sn3 networks can stabilize the morphology
of -Sn by retarding their grain growth, and maintain the strength
of solders.

diﬀusion exhibit very diﬀerent activation energies, and in
fact the activation energy of Sn diﬀusion in matrix Sn is
three times higher than that of Cu diﬀusion in Sn [7,8].
Such a large diﬀerence in activation energy suggests that
temperature may play a very important role in determining
the dominant degradation mechanism. The objective of the
present study is to analyze the temperature eﬀects on Cu
and Sn electromigration ﬂuxes in Sn. The analysis is then
applied to describing the dominant microstructure evolu-
tion under current stressing at various temperatures.
Experiments are also carried out to verify whether the anal-
ysis has captured suﬃcient features of the system.
2. Analysis
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of electromigra-
tion in a simple Cu/Sn/Cu system. It is assumed that the
electron current ﬂows evenly upwards, and no current
crowding is allowed. A layer of Cu6Sn5 exists on both inter-
faces. In certain experimental conditions, a layer of Cu3Sn
might also exist between Cu and Cu6Sn5, but it will become
clear later that the existence or absence of Cu3Sn will not
interfere with the following analysis. Consider a small con-
trol volume of Sn very close to the cathode side, shown in
the region enclosed by red dashed line in Fig. 1. Within this
control volume, there is a small amount of dissolved Cu
atoms. Since this control volume is near the cathode, it is
assumed that local equilibrium has been established, and
Cu has reached its solubility limit in Sn within the control
volume.
The electromigration ﬂuxes of Cu, JCu, and Sn, JSn,
illustrated in Fig. 1 can be written, respectively, as [9]
JCu ¼ CCu DCukT z

CueqSnj ð1Þ
JSn ¼ CSn DSnkT z

SneqSnj ð2Þ
where CCu and CSn are the local molar concentrations
(mole per unit volume) of Cu and Sn in the control volume,
respectively; DCu and DSn are the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of
Cu in Sn and Sn in Sn, respectively; zCu and z

Sn are the
eﬀective charge numbers of Cu in Sn and Sn in Sn, respec-
tively. The symbol k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the
absolute temperature, e is the charge of an electron, qSn
is the resistivity of Sn, and j is the applied electron current
density.
Dividing Eq. (1) by Eq. (2), one obtains the electromi-
gration ﬂux ratio of Cu to Sn within the control volume as
JCu
JSn
¼ CCuDCuz

Cu
CSnDSnzSn
ð3Þ
Eq. (3) can be simpliﬁed as
JCu
JSn
¼ XCu DCuz

Cu
DSnzSn
ð4Þ
where XCu is the mole fraction of Cu in the control volume.
This simpliﬁcation is valid because the maximum Cu mole
fraction in Sn is 0.0001 [10]. With the assumption that local
thermodynamic equilibrium has been established for the
control volume, XCu is simply the saturated limit of Cu in
Sn at a certain temperature.
In Eq. (4), the diﬀusion coeﬃcients and the Cu solubility
are all very strong functions of temperature. In fact, they
all vary exponentially with temperature, as will be dis-
cussed in detail later. The eﬀective charge, however, is only
a weak function of temperature [11]. It was also pointed
out by Orchard and Greer [12] that the temperature varia-
tion of the eﬀective charge is likely to be dwarfed by the
temperature variation of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. With
these diﬀerent temperature dependencies in mind, it is
assumed in the following analysis that the temperature var-
iation in the ratio zCu=z

Sn is negligibly small compared with
those of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients and solubility. Conse-
quently, Eq. (4) can be written as
JCu
JSn
¼ CXCu DCuDSn ð5Þ
where C equals zCu=z

Sn and is a temperature-independent
constant with an order-of-magnitude value of one.
In the following, the temperature dependencies for those
two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (5) are discussed in
detail so that the ratio of the Cu electromigration ﬂux to
that of Sn within the control volume can be analyzed.
2.1. Eﬀect of temperature on the solubility of Cu in solid Sn
phase
The solubility of Cu in solid Sn phase was reported to be
0.01 at.% Cu [10], but its temperature dependence, i.e., the
solvus line in Sn-rich region, has not been experimentally
measured. From formal thermodynamic consideration,
the solvus line in systems of limited terminal solubility
can be described by an Arrhenius equation [13]:
XCu ¼ A exp  BkT
 
ð6Þ
where A and B are temperature-independent constants.
From the thermodynamic assessments of the Cu–Sn system
by various investigators [14,15], A and B can be estimated
Fig. 1. Schematic representation of electromigration in an idealized Cu/
Sn/Cu system where no current crowding is present.

consumption will be the dominant features at low temper-
atures. This is because the applied current has the ability to
drive the dissolved Cu atoms away from the cathode side
very quickly. This makes the local Cu concentration near
the cathode drop below saturation, so that the dissolution
of Cu6Sn5 and/or the Cu cathode are accelerated. Under
such a condition, before enough Sn atoms are driven away
and the void has enough driving force to nucleate, the
excessive metallization consumption has already become
a problem. In contrast, if the solder temperature is high,
the ratio JCu/JSn becomes smaller, and Cu and Sn electro-
migration ﬂux becomes relatively comparable. Under this
condition, not only the metallization consumption but also
pancake-type void formation may become the dominant
mechanisms. This is because the excessive out-diﬀusion of
Sn creates the driving force for the nucleation of the pan-
cake-type void.
In summary, the above analysis suggests that tempera-
ture is the key factor determining the dominant mecha-
nism. The formation of a pancake-type void tends to be
the dominant mechanism at high temperatures, and the
excessive consumption of metallization layer tends to be
the dominant mechanism at low temperatures.
3. Experimental
To conﬁrm the proposition that temperature is the key
factor determining the dominant mechanism, one needs
to carry out electromigration tests under both high-temper-
ature and low-temperature conditions, using test samples
with the same internal conﬁguration.
Fig. 5 schematically depicts the solder joints used in this
study. The solder alloy was composed of Sn–0.7Cu (wt.%).
The under-bump metallurgy (UBM) on the chip side
employed a Ti/Ni(V)/Cu structure, while the metallization
on the substrate side was a 15-lm layer of Cu. Solder joints
were connected by on-chip Al lines 1.2 lm thick and 60 lm
wide. Each solder joint had a normal diameter of 145 lm,
and the diameter of the contact window was 90 lm.
Standard underﬁll was applied between the chip and the
substrate. The internal circuit of the dies was a daisy-chain
design, with several external leads built in for electric con-
nection and resistance monitoring.
The technique of temperature control for ﬂip chip solder
joints during current stressing was described in a previous
publication [17], and the details are omitted here for brev-
ity. In short, the chips were cooled by a brass cooling
block, through which cooling water circulated with regu-
lated temperature and ﬂow rate.
The chip surface temperature of the back side (the side
without solder joints) was maintained at 60 C by the cool-
ing system. An electron current of 2.86 A or 3.50 A was
applied, producing a nominal current density of 4.5  104
or 5.5  104 A cm2, respectively (based on the opening
area of the contact window). Furthermore, a three-dimen-
sional ﬁnite-element analysis was conducted with measur-
able boundary conditions to estimate the current density
and temperature distribution within a solder joint.
The high-temperature electromigration tests using the
same test samples were carried out by turning oﬀ the cool-
ing system. To compare the electromigration test results
between high-temperature and low-temperature condi-
tions, an electron current of 0.64 A was applied, producing
a nominal current density of 1.0  104 A cm2 within the
same order of magnitude as low-temperature electromigra-
tion tests. Without the cooling system, the chip tempera-
ture became 180 C, as a result of the Joule heating eﬀect.
4. Results and discussion
Fig. 6 shows a micrograph of the ﬂip chip solder joint at
the as-assembly condition the before current stressing. A
layer of Cu6Sn5 formed at both the chip side and the sub-
strate side. The formation of only this particular com-
pound was consistent with the literature result, and the
rationale has been reported elsewhere [18].

extended along Cu6Sn5/solder interface in a direction per-
pendicular to the image surface of Fig. 9a. In addition to
void formation, Cu metallization consumption was
observed in Fig. 9a. About 5–15 lm of Cu metallization
was consumed. The compound Cu3Sn was the dominant
intermetallic compound at the cathode interface. It is gen-
erally accepted that both Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 form at the
interface of Cu and Sn during high-temperature aging.
But when a void or gap initiates and extends along
Cu6Sn5/Sn interface, Cu6Sn5 loses the source of Sn atoms.
In this case, Cu3Sn will grow at the expense of Cu6Sn5 and
Cu metallization.
The result of electromigration tests at high temperature
shows that both void formation and consumption of met-
allization and intermetallic compound occurred at the cath-
ode interface. The result agreed with the prediction of Eq.
(9) and Fig. 4, which show that JCu/JSn is close to 2 at
180 C. In other words, JCu and JSn are in the same order
of magnitude, so void formation and metallization con-
sumption are both important microstructure features in

Abstract
Dissolution of cathode metallization is one of the key degradation processes for solder interconnects under electron current stressing.
Very recently, several studies have shown that this dissolution often results in a highly serrated interface, but little is known about how
the serrated interface develops and what mechanism contributes to this intriguing microstructural feature. This paper presents detailed
observations from a purposely designed experiment to uncover the responsible mechanism. These observations reveal that a pronounced
and unstable grain boundary grooving between Cu6Sn5 grains occurs before the serrated cathode starts to develop. This grooving process
is driven by preferential dissolution at the grain boundaries, a process similar to the formation of scallop-type Cu6Sn5 between molten
solder and Cu. Furthermore, the diﬀusion and reaction are more signiﬁcant at the valley of the grooves, which increases the local con-
sumption rate of Cu. This non-uniform consumption of Cu eventually leads to a serrated cathode interface.

1. Introduction
Current-induced degradation of solder interconnects
occurs mostly at the interface between the solder and inter-
metallic compounds. Two degradation mechanisms have
been addressed and investigated: the formation of pan-
cake-type voids and the excessive consumption or dissolu-
tion of the Cu or Ni metallization layer [1–5]. Most of the
current-induced failures in solder joints reported in the lit-
erature can be attributed to either one or a combination of
these two mechanisms. The formation of pancake-type
voids is caused by the electromigration or thermomigration
of Sn through a vacancy-mediated self-diﬀusion process [6],
whereas the consumption of the Cu or Ni metallization
layer is driven by the electromigration or thermomigration
of Cu or Ni interstitials in the Sn lattice, both of which are
fast diﬀusers in solder alloys [7,8].
Two key factors determining the dominant degradation
mechanism were identiﬁed recently [9,10]. Lu et al. [9] found
that current-induced damage strongly depended on the
tetragonal anisotropy of Sn crystals. It was found that when
the c axis of Sn crystals was aligned with the current direc-
tion, electromigration damage was dominated by the rapid
consumption of the metallization layer. This was attributed
to the fact that electromigration or diﬀusion of Cu or Ni
atoms along the c axis of Sn crystals is much faster than that
along the a axis. Very recently, Ke et al. [10] suggested that
temperature is another important factor determining the
dominant mechanism. They found that, at higher tempera-
tures, both Sn and Cu electromigration ﬂux are important
and, consequently, void formation and metallization con-
sumption operate simultaneously. However, at lower tem-
peratures, the Sn electromigration ﬂux is relatively
unimportant, so the Cu metallization layer is excessively
consumed before the nucleation or propagation of voids.
Several independent studies have shown that metalliza-
tion dissolution often results in a highly serrated cathode
interface [11–14]. Such a microstructure seems to be a

maintain a stable constant temperature. Consequently, the
specimen temperature was maintained at 150 ± 2 C during
the entire electromigration test.c
After annealing and electromigration tests, the speci-
mens were subjected to metallographic grinding and polish-
ing processes to reveal the interior microstructure. Scanning
electron microscopy and scanning ion microscopy (SIM)
were used to examine the microstructure. Energy dispersive
X-ray spectrometry was used to identify the chemical
composition of each phase.
3. Results
Fig. 2a shows the micrograph of the Cu/Sn/Cu solder
joint after annealing at 150 C for 24 h, and Fig. 2b shows
a zoomed-in view of the interface. Both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn
intermetallic compounds formed after annealing. The
formation of these two compounds was consistent with
the literature result, and the rationale has been reported
elsewhere [16]. Both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn intermetallic com-
pounds exhibited a layered morphology, which is a com-
mon feature for solid-state annealing. The average
thicknesses of the Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn intermetallic
compound layers were 1.9 lm and 0.8 lm, respectively.
The microstructure shown in Fig. 2 was the starting point
for all subsequent current stressing.
3.1. Interfacial reactions of the annealed specimens without
current stressing
Fig. 3a–c shows the interfacial micrographs after further
annealing at 150 C for 100, 300 and 700 h, respectively.
These thermal treatments were in addition to the initial
24 h annealing at 150 C. Both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn interme-
tallic compounds maintained layer-type morphology dur-
ing solid-state annealing. Some microvoids appeared
within Cu3Sn and increased with the annealing time. The
formation of the microvoids was attributed to the unbal-
anced diﬀusion ﬂux of Cu and Sn across Cu3Sn [17–19].
Some literature has indicated that the formation of microv-
oids in Cu3Sn is highly related to the impurities produced
in the Cu electroplating process [20]. Fig. 4 shows the thick-
nesses of Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn intermetallic compounds plot-
ted vs the annealing time. The growth kinetics of Cu6Sn5
and Cu3Sn both obeyed the parabolic-growth law, which
indicated that the formation of Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn was a
diﬀusion-controlled reaction. The growth kinetics matched
quite well with that reported by Onishi and Fujibuchi [21].
3.2. Interfacial reactions of the current-stressed specimens
Fig. 5 shows the cross-sectional microstructure of the
solder joints that had been stressed for 700 h. The electron
current entered the solder joint from the lower side (cath-
ode) and exited through the upper side Cu (anode). The
applied current density was 1  104 A cm2, and the tem-
perature of the solder joints was controlled at 150 C.
Voids or gaps started to form at the cathode interface
between Cu6Sn5 and Sn, and a signiﬁcant amount of Cu
was consumed at the cathode. The consumed Cu atoms
were drifted to the anode by electromigration, producing
a signiﬁcant growth of Cu6Sn5 at the anode interface.
The result was consistent with most electromigration tests
conducted at high temperature, which showed that both

other, while some small-sized and faceted Cu6Sn5 grains
remained in the Sn matrix near the cathode interface. After
current stressing for 700 h, the serrated interface became
more signiﬁcant, and voids started to form near the inter-
face between Cu6Sn5 and Sn, as shown in Fig. 7e. The voids
blocked the electromigration ﬂux of Cu, so the dissolution
process ceased locally at the void region. Also shown in
Fig. 7e is the abnormally thick Cu3Sn intermetallic com-
pound formed beneath the void region. When a void
appeared at the Cu6Sn5/Sn interface, Cu6Sn5 lost the
source of Sn atoms. In this case, Cu3Sn may grow at the
expense of Cu6Sn5 and Cu metallization.
Contrary to the severe undulation of the cathode inter-
face, the anode interface exhibited a much more planar
morphology. Fig. 8a–e shows zoomed-in micrographs of
the anode interface after current stressing for 100, 200,
300, 500 and 700 h, respectively. The Cu6Sn5 intermetallic
compound at the anode exhibited a more planar interface
than that of the annealed specimens, owing to the uniform
current density in the solder joints. One major distinction
of the anode interface compared with that of the annealed
specimens was the number of microvoids formed in Cu3Sn.
Fig. 8d and e shows that the microvoid formation in Cu3Sn
was signiﬁcantly enhanced, and many of them accumulated
at the anode Cu/Cu3Sn interface after current stressing for
500 and 700 h, respectively. This result is consistent with
the observations reported by Liu et al. [26].
4. Discussion
The most striking feature of current-induced dissolution
at the cathode in the solid state is the morphological tran-
sition of the Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound. The mor-
phology of Cu6Sn5 changed from a layer-type structure
to a scallop-type structure during the initial 100 h of cur-
rent stressing. The development of scallop-type Cu6Sn5
was analogous to that of the reaction between Cu and mol-
ten solder. Ma et al. [27] used SnPb/Cu samples to eluci-
date the mechanism of scallop formation during reﬂow.
Prior to reﬂow, the samples were annealed at 150 C for
240 h to produce an initially planar intermetallic (Cu6Sn5)
layer with an average thickness of 4.7 lm, which was sim-
ilar to the approach taken before applying the electric cur-
rent. After one reﬂow, they observed that the planar
intermetallic changed to a serrated granular structure with
deep grooves developed at the grain boundaries. The
grooves showed a variety of shapes, indicating an unstable
grooving process after one reﬂow. The intermetallic thick-
ness decreased to 2.9 lm during the ﬁrst ﬁve reﬂow cycles.
After seven reﬂows, the intermetallic exhibited a stable
scalloped structure, and its thickness increased to 4.5 lm.
This result indicates that the preferential dissolution of
intermetallic compound at the grain boundaries contrib-
uted to the formation of the scalloped structure. The disso-
lution kinetics of a substrate into a molten metal is
described by the following equation [28]:
JCu ¼ DCu cs  cd ð1Þ
where JCu is the dissolution ﬂux of Cu in molten Sn, DCu is
the diﬀusivity of Cu in molten Sn near the Cu6Sn5/Sn inter-
face, d is the thickness of the diﬀusion boundary layer adja-
cent to the interface, c is the Cu concentration in the bulk
of the solder (outside the boundary layer), and cs is the Cu
saturation concentration in the solder. The morphological
transition is generally known to be caused by the fast grain
boundary diﬀusion at Cu6Sn5 grain boundaries. This was
similar to the feature observed after the ﬁrst 100 h of
Fig. 6. Microstructure of joints that were stressed at 150 C for (a) 100, (b) 200, (c) 300 and (d) 500 h, respectively. The nominal current density was

2086 J.H. Ke et al. / Acta Materialia 60 (2012) 2082–2090
grain boundaries of Cu6Sn5 only. In the solid-state reaction
between Cu and Sn without current stressing, a stable grain
boundary grooving is maintained, and both Cu6Sn5 and
Cu3Sn exhibit a planar structure, as shown in Fig. 12a.
When an electric current is applied, preferential dissolution
occurs at the Cu6Sn5 grain boundaries, due to the rapid Cu
diﬀusion. The stable grain boundary grooving cannot be
maintained, and the morphology of Cu6Sn5 gradually
changes to a scalloped structure, as shown in Fig. 12b.
After further current stressing, some channels between
Cu6Sn5 scallops begin to develop, and the morphology of
Cu6Sn5 further changes to an unstable dendrite-type struc-
ture. Because the diﬀusion and reactions at the valley of the
channels are more signiﬁcant than the other region, the Cu
consumption rate increases rapidly and creates a highly ser-
rated cathode interface. The progress is shown in Fig. 12c.
It indicates that the development of the serrated cathode
interface may be very sensitive to the initial microstructure,
such as the position and distribution of the Cu6Sn5 grain
boundaries.
It is worth noting that the serrated interface accompa-
nied by dissolution was not only observed in electromigra-
tion tests, but also found in thermomigration studies.
Abdulhamid and Basaran [31] conducted thermomigration
experiments on 95.5Sn–4Ag–0.5Cu lead-free solder jointed
with two Cu plates. The hot end and cold end were con-
trolled at 160 C and 50 C, respectively, producing a ther-
mal gradient of 1000 C cm1. After thermomigration for
286 h, non-uniformity or waviness of the Cu/intermetallic
and intermetallic/solder interfaces was observed at the
hot end. Its morphology was nearly identical to the ser-
rated cathode interface produced by electromigration.
Because the driving force for atomic migration that results
from the thermal gradient of 1000 C cm1 is comparable

to an unstable dendrite-type structure with the formation
of many channels between the Cu6Sn5 scallops. The mor-
phological transition indicates that current-induced disso-
lution proceeds without a stable grain boundary grooving
of Cu6Sn5. The dissolution is observed to be more pro-
nounced at the Cu6Sn5 grain boundaries, which is analo-
gous to the morphological transition of Cu6Sn5 in molten
state reactions. This feature is caused mainly by the fast
grain boundary diﬀusion, but not by the variation in cur-
rent density resulting from the redistribution of diﬀerent
phases. The diﬀusion and reactions are more signiﬁcant
at the valley of the channel, where the intermetallic com-
pound is thinner, so the local consumption rate of the Cu
metallization will be enhanced at the valley. The preferen-
tial dissolution at the Cu6Sn5 grain boundaries and non-
uniform consumption rate of the Cu metallization ﬁnally
lead to the serrated cathode interface.

Ni12P5, Ni2P, Ni2SnP, and Ni3Sn4 [14,16,18,22]. Initially,
however, it was unclear whether the IMC was Ni2SnP
[15,16,19–22], Ni3SnP [23] or Ni55Sn35P10 [24,25]. Kang
et al. [20] subsequently identiﬁed the compound as Ni2SnP
by using hot-stage transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). During interfacial reactions, two types of voids
formed: one type is formed in the Ni2SnP region and the
other in the Ni3P region. Depending on their density, the
voids potentially aﬀect the strength of the solder joints
and produced brittle fracture at the interface between
Ni2SnP and Ni3Sn4. Most researchers believe that brittle
fracture occurs in theNi3P voids. Extensive studies havebeen
conducted on the Ni3P column voids [7,11–14,16,17,26–28].
However, in most cases, the interface cracking was not at
Ni3P voids, but in the thin Ni2SnP layer [11,12,22,29,30].
Very few studies have investigated these Ni2SnP voids in
detail because of the need for advanced TEM techniques
to analyze nanoscale voids [22,26]. In most previous studies,
the formation of these voids has been attributed to the Kir-
kendall eﬀect [20–22,25,27]. Laurila and Vourinen [11],
Vourinen et al. [24], and Kang et al. [19] observed voids in
Ni2SnP during reﬂow carried out for less than 60 s. Kang
et al. [19] suggested that these voids were Kirkendall voids,
but Laurila, Vourinen and co-workers proposed two other
hypotheses [11,13,24]. One was that the voids were caused
by organic residue resulting from non-optimization of the
plating bath, and the other was that the voids were caused
by supersaturation of P in Sn, which is present between
Ni–P and the molten solder. However, these hypotheses
have not been validated experimentally.
In this study, the formation of voids in Ni2SnP during
reﬂow is investigated. The objective of this study is to elu-
cidate the mechanism of void formation and investigate the
associated phenomena. An ENIG substrate with medium P
content is reﬂowed with Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu at diﬀerent reﬂow
peak temperatures and cycles. Void evolution and void
density are then recorded and presented. The results show
that the voids in Ni2SnP are caused by the plating process
and that they coalesce with an increase in the number of
reﬂow cycles and the peak temperature. However, the void
density increases as the number of reﬂow cycles increases.
These coalesced voids are responsible for interfacial frac-
ture. The mechanism of formation of these Ni2SnP voids
is then discussed.
2. Experimental procedure
The ENIG substrate was ﬁrst analyzed by TEM (JEOL
JEM-2100F, operated at 200 keV) to understand the initial
plating structure. The P content of the Ni layer was
between 5 and 9 wt.%. A focused ion beam (FIB) was used
to fabricate a 70–90 nm thin section of the sample. Energy-
dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to study the
sample composition. The beam size in EDX was 2 nm.
As-plated ENIG substrates were printed with a layer of
water-soluble ﬂux. A Sn3Ag0.5Cu solder ball (diameter:
0.75 mm) was then placed on the substrates. The assemblies
were reﬂowed in an oven with ten heating zones at ambient
oxygen levels (20 ppm). The temperature diﬀerence within
the assemblies in the reﬂow chamber was less than
1 C cm1, as determined by thermocouple measurement.
During reﬂow, the specimen heated at 230 C for 30 s
was removed from the oven and rapidly quenched by
immersion in an ice bath (time:5 s) to freeze the interfacial
reaction [31].
The assemblies were subsequently reﬂowed at 230 C,
240 C, and 250 C peak reﬂow temperature for 60 s above
the liquidus temperature (217 C). Samples reﬂowed at
250 C for 60 s were subjected to multiple reﬂow cycles,
i.e. up to ten cycles. The samples subject to diﬀerent sets
of reﬂow conditions were analyzed for measurement of
the interfacial void density. The ﬁeld emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) images
(micrographs) of the samples were obtained under the same
magniﬁcation.
3. Results
3.1. As-plated substrate
Fig. 1 shows the nanovoids and Ni crystals at the inter-
face between Au and Ni–P. The size of the nanovoids was
2–4 nm, as observed by bright-ﬁeld TEM (BF-TEM).
At a medium P content, Ni nanocrystals were identiﬁed at
the interface. Since several research groups have reported
the formation of such Ni nanocrystals [7,8,10,18,32,33],
we have excluded this topic from the present study. The
voids’ size could be changed by tilting the sample inside
the TEM chamber. EDX analysis was performed on the
Ni–P region, and the calculated compositions were as
follows: Ni, 81–85 wt.% (83–90 at.%) and P, 5–9 wt.%
(10–16 at.%). No organic compounds were detected.

9 wt.% on a Ni layer.

4.2. Evolution of voids during reﬂow
During reﬂow soldering, the nanovoids eﬀervesced
because of vapor pressure diﬀerence [36] and the dissolution
of Au and Ni [11–14,34]. Lin et al. [34] showed that during
reﬂow, the dissolution zones contained many vacancies that
possibly originated at this interface between immersion Au
and electroless Ni as found in Fig. 1. Upon cooling, solidi-
ﬁcation of the IMC [31,34] occurred, and these vacancies
were trapped to result in the formation of voids, as shown
in Fig. 2. The size of the voids increased to 7 nm, which
was almost twice the original size, indicating coalescence
of the vacancies to form larger voids. Kang et al. [19,21] also
reported that the voids in the Ni2SnP were attributed to the
vacancies accumulated after reﬂow at 255 C for 60 s. How-
ever, they did not ﬁnd such voids during reﬂow at 255 C for
3 s and suggested that these voids were Kirkendall voids. In
contrast, these voids were found during reﬂow at 230 C at
30 s in the present study. The diﬀerence between our results
and Kang et al.’s results could be because of the diﬀerence in
the experimental methods adopted.
During the IMC formation [31,34], interdiﬀusion
betweenNi and Sn atoms occurred; as a result, the vacancies
were aligned to form a series of voids instead of randomly
distributed voids. Some researchers presumed that these
were Kirkendall voids [19–22,27,29], while some others
stated that these were liquid miscibility gaps [13,15,21], as
Kirkendall voids cannot be formed in a short reﬂow time
because of the diﬀusion process. On the basis of these results
and the results published previously, the nanovoids were
conﬁrmed to be formed in an as-plated substrate (Fig. 1).
Large vacancies were observed by Lin [34] during the early
stages of reﬂow. These voids were trapped and aligned in
Ni2SnP (Fig. 2). The void density did not change with the
reﬂow time (Fig. 3d). Therefore, we suggested that these
voids in Ni2SnP originated from the miscibility gaps formed
during plating.
4.3. Eﬀect of number of reﬂow cycles on voids and fracture
As shown in Fig. 4, the voids coalesced to form a void
line with an increase in the number of reﬂow cycles. Ini-
tially, void density increased slowly, became constant,
and ﬁnally saturated at 24 voids lm1. At saturation,
the voids were linked to each other over the entire interface
(Fig. 4e). Chin et al. [37] showed that the percentage of
brittle fracture after four reﬂow cycles was high. Because
of the linkage of these voids, the interface weakened and
brittle fracture occurred. With repeated reﬂow cycles, the
size of the voids increased to 18 nm. Zeng and Tu [12] sta-
ted that the voids can grow to 1 lm after 256 min of reﬂow.
This is the Kirkendall eﬀect.
The voids in the Ni3P region elongated toward the bulk
solder. The voids were attributed to Ni diﬀused from
Ni–P. Fabber et al. [8] showed that Ni–P is an amorphous
compound and that P in the Ni region basically connected

4.5. Kinetics of nanovoid evolution
To describe the evolution of these voids, we applied the
John–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) theory and
modeled the void growth from nucleation to coalescence.
In the JMAK theory, the nucleation and coalescence of
voids are due to diﬀusion with no chemical reaction
[41–43]. The fractional connecting voids, X(t), to the entire
interfacial line is given as

the opposite direction, isolating Sn into many small
pockets in the cross-sectional view. When the aging time
reached 120 h, as showed in Figure 1(c), all Sn had been
converted into Ni3Sn4. One key observation of this
study was the existence of many voids within the Ni3Sn4.
To avoid the possibility that these voids were artifacts
due to mechanical polishing, a sample that had been
aged for 240 h, shown in Figure 1(d), was cross-
sectioned by using an ion beam polisher, which is known
to have the capability of producing a relatively high
quality and artifact-free surface. The fact that voids still
existed in Figure 1(d) suggested that these voids were an
intrinsic feature of such reaction under space conﬁne-
ment. In fact, these voids consistently showed up in all
of the Ni/Sn/Ni samples aged at all temperatures as long
as all the Sn had been consumed. The existence of these
voids raises serious reliability concerns, as such voids
would no doubt weaken the solder joints.
To understand the mechanism responsible for void
formation, it needs to be noted that there is a net volume
shrinkage when Ni and Sn react to form Ni3Sn4. The
molar volumes for Ni, Sn and Ni3Sn4 are 6.59, 16.26
and 75.25 cm3 mol1, respectively [10,11]. The volume
shrinkage is calculated to be {75.25  [3(6.59) +
4(16.26)]}/[3(6.59) + 4(16.26)] = 0.113, or 11.3%.
With this information, the mechanism of void formation
can be understood with the help of the illustration
shown in Figure 2. Before the Ni3Sn4 grains from oppo-
site directions start to impinge on each other, as is the
case shown in Figure 1(a), the volume shrinkage could
freely be accommodated by the thickness decrease in
the sandwiches. However, when enough of the Ni3Sn4
grains impinged on each other, as are the cases shown
in Figure 1(c) and (d), the decrease in vertical thickness
became diﬃcult to accommodate without plastic defor-
mation of the Ni3Sn4 grains. As plastic deformation of
the hard Ni3Sn4 was very diﬃcult, the volume shrinkage
had to be dissipated through other means. Because Sn
was the main diﬀusion species through Ni3Sn4 [8,12],
more Sn atoms diﬀused out of the Sn pocket shown in
Figure 2 than Ni atoms that reached the pocket. As
the reaction continued, a void gradually formed and
grew within each Sn pocket.
The proposed mechanism suggests that no void will
form if there is no Ni3Sn4 impingement and trapped
Sn pockets. This is indeed what we observe in Figure
1(e). Here, a Ni/Sn(5 lm) bilayer structure was plated
and then left to react until the Sn had completely disap-
peared. Because now all the volume shrinkage could be
accommodated by the decrease in vertical thickness, no
void was observed at all.
Although the literature indicates that Ag atoms do
not become incorporated into Ni3Sn4 but simply become
Ag3Sn [7,8], the present study shows that the addition of
Ag completely eliminate these voids. Figure 3(a)–(d)
shows the Ni/Sn2.4Ag(7 lm)/Ni sandwiches aged at
180 C for 12, 72, 378 and 528 h, respectively. As shown
in Figure 3(a), two layers of Ni3Sn4 grew toward each
other from the opposite interfaces, and Ag3Sn at this
stage existed as small round particles. These small Ag3Sn
particles had coarsened into larger ones by the time the
aging had reached 72 h, as shown in Figure 3(b). At
378 h, Ni3Sn4 grains growing from opposite directions
started to impinge on each other, and there was a small
amount of Sn left, as shown in Figure 3(c). Very surpris-
ingly, the Ag3Sn particles were ﬂattened somewhat and
located between the two Ni3Sn4 layers. It should be
emphasized that nearly all the Ag3Sn ended up located
between the two Ni3Sn4 layers. When the aging time
reached 528 h, as showed in Figure 3(d), all the Sn had

quired out-diﬀusion of Ag atoms is the key factor
responsible for this slowing down.

Fig. 1. Micrographs showing the Ni/Sn(10 µm)/Ni sandwiches after reaction
at 250 ◦C for (a) 1, (b) 3, (c) 10, and (d) 20 min.
fluxes can be considered to be only along the vertical direction,
i.e., the space-confined direction.
To simulate the assembly process, the sandwiches were
reacted at 250 ◦C for 1, 3, 10, and 20 min. As shown in
Fig. 1(a)–(d), two layers of Ni3Sn4 grew toward each other
from the opposite interfaces. About half of the solder was
consumed after 20 min of reaction. This suggests that if the
Sn thickness had been 5 μm, instead of 10 μm here, the entire
joint would have been completely composed of Ni3Sn4. This
extrapolation is reasonable because it had been shown that
solder volume had very little impact on the reaction kinetics,
even when the solder was only a few μm in size [4]. While
the 20 min reaction time does seem excessive at first glance, it
should be noted that at least one reflow is required to stack one
additional die onto the die stack. To produce a 16-die stack of
3-D ICs, at least 16 reflows are required. Besides, during outer
levels of electronic packaging, additional reflows are needed. It
follows that 20 min duration is not an unreasonable expectation
for micro solder joints to experience.
During solid state aging, solder also reacts to form IMCs
very quickly. The growth kinetics for Ni/Sn/Ni sandwiches
at different temperatures with different initial Sn thickness
is shown in Fig. 2 [4]. Fig. 2 shows the averaged thickness
Fig. 2. Average thickness of Ni3Sn4 per interface at 150 ◦C, 180 ◦C, and
200 ◦C for Ni/Sn(5 µm)/Ni and Ni/Sn(10 µm)/Ni sandwiches. Each
data point was determined by dividing the total Ni3Sn4 thickness in
each sandwich by two. Solid symbols (,, •) denote data points from
Ni/Sn(5 µm)/Ni sandwiches. Hollow symbols (,, ◦) denote data points
from Ni/Sn(10 µm)/Ni sandwiches. This data are adapted from reference 4.
of Ni3Sn4 per interface. In other words, the measured total
thickness in each sandwich was divided by two and then plotted
in Fig. 2. The growth kinetic data shown in Fig. 2 are consistent
with previous studies in literature [5]–[9]. The data in Fig. 2
suggest that when Sn in Ni/Sn/Ni is a few μm thick, Sn can
be completely converted into Ni3Sn4 after a few hundred h of
aging even if the temperature is as low as 150 ◦C.
Among common UBM and surface finish materials, such
as Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, and Pt, Ni is known to have the slowest
reaction kinetics with solid or molten solders [10]–[12]. The
results in Figs. 1 and 2 show that, even for the slowest reacting
element Ni, a large portion or even the entirety of the solder
layer might be transformed into IMCs during assembly or
aging. Consequently, for Cu and other faster reacting elements,
it can be expected that the IMCs will occupy an even larger
portion of a solder joint for the same thermal history. In other
words, it has to be expected that IMCs will occupy a large
portion of the volume of micro solder joints in 3-D IC packages.
Under such conditions, the mechanical properties of IMCs play
dominant roles. Understanding the mechanical behaviors of
IMCs-dominated solder joints is one of the most urgent and
critical issues.
III. ISSUE (B): IMC GRAIN IMPINGEMENT AND RIPENING
As the distance between the two opposite interfaces in a
micro joint is only a few μm, IMCs growing from these two
interfaces approach each other as interfacial reaction proceeds.
Given enough time, these IMCs grains will impinge upon
each other, and even ripen into larger grains. One key concern
is the resulting microstructural defects generated during the
morphological evolution of grain impingement and ripening.
Fig. 3 illustrates a type of defect generated due to grain
impingement. Fig. 3(a)–(c) show the Ni/Sn(10 μm)/Ni sand-
wiches aged at 180 ◦C for 72, 192, and 240 h, respectively.
During aging, two layers of Ni3Sn4 grew toward each other
236 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEVICE AND MATERIALS RELIABILITY, VOL. 12, NO. 2, JUNE 2012
would be eventually transformed into Cu3Sn. Unfortunately,
Cu3Sn grains growing from the opposite sides would not merge
into single crystalline grains, leaving boundaries throughout the
entire joint [14]. These boundaries could become weak links
responsible for the degradation of the joint strength. In addition,
Cu3Sn occupying the entire joint also posts one other concern.
Microvoids could form within the Cu3Sn layer [15]–[17]. These
voids can lead to severe reliability concern.
This observation that grains from the opposite interfaces
could merge offers the hope that single crystalline IMC joint
could be produced under proper processing conditions. Such
single crystal joint could exhibit a superior strength compared
to solder/IMC composite joints or poly crystalline IMC joints.
New studies are urgently needed to verify this proposition.
IV. ISSUE (C): RISE OF IMPURITY CONCENTRATION
DUE TO SOLDER CONSUMPTION
Electroplating is one of the methods that solder is deposited
in micro bumps of 3-D ICs. Electroplating will inevitably
introduce various impurities into the solder layer [15], [16].
These impurities include organic or inorganic complex agents,
acids, sulfates or sulfides, surface levelers, foreign metal atoms,
etc. In the as-plated condition, the concentrations for most
of these impurities are typically very low and normally will
not post any problem. Most of these molecules or atoms are
insoluble in IMCs, and will be rejected and pushed away from
the IMC/solder interface as the reaction proceeds. As more and
more solder is consumed, the effective concentrations for these
impurities increase as schematically shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b).
When all the solder is consumed, the apparent concentrations of
impurity will reach very high values, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c).
Eventually the impurity molecules or atoms might even aggre-
gate into new phases or voids, decorating along the boundary
of IMC grains growing from the opposite directions. These new
phases or voids might constitute structural defects and weaken
the micro joints. In addition, these new phases or voids will
hinder the merging of IMCs grains growing from the opposite
directions mentioned in the previous section.
Impurities from electroplating are used as an example in the
previous paragraph, but impurities from sources in fact have
the same problem so long as these impurities are not soluble in
IMCs. For instance, in direct solder ball mounting the thin sur-
face oxide over the solder balls and flux residue might create the
same type of problem. In summary, impurities in conventional
solder joints may not cause any detrimental effects because
their concentrations stay about the same during the lifetime
of the joints. However, in micro joints the impurities in solder
are constantly being concentrated as more and more solder is
consumed. Problems that do not exist in conventional solder
joints may arise due to the rise of impurity concentrations.
V. ISSUE (D): RISE OF CONCENTRATIONS
OF MINOR SOLDER CONSTITUENTS
Minor solder constituents such as Ag, Bi, In, Fe, Co, Ni,
etc. have pronounced effects on the soldering reactions and
the resultant reliabilities. Among these additives, Ag and Bi
are additives which are inert to the soldering reaction. In other
Fig. 5. Schematic drawings showing the impurities become concentrated as
more and more solder is converted into IMC. (a) As-assembly condition.
(b) Two-third of the solder consumed and (c) all solder been consumed.
words, Ag or Bi does not become incorporated into interfacial
IMC as more solder is consumed [18]. Following the same
logic in the previous section, minor solder constituents that are
purposely added will also become concentrated if these minor
solder constituents do not become incorporated into interfacial
IMC as more solder is consumed. The most obvious example is
Ag, which is a key component in many commercially important
lead-free solders, such as the SAC (SnAgCu) alloys. Silver does
not incorporate itself into common IMCs, such as Cu6Sn5 or
Ni3Sn4, that form at the solder/substrate interface, and is re-
jected into the remaining solder, forming Ag3Sn islands located
within the solder [11], [19]–[21]. When all the solder has been
consumed, these Ag3Sn islands end up located near the central
region of the joint. If the initial Ag concentration in solder
is high enough, Ag3Sn islands will even link up with each
other, forming a continuous Ag3Sn layer [2]. One unexpected
benefit of Ag addition is that the voids shown in Fig. 3(c)
are eliminated [2]. Reference [2] gives a more complete and
detailed description of this behavior. Additional studies are
needed to determine the minimum level of Ag addition for
void elimination and the maximum level of Ag addition without

Assuming rpad equals r, one obtains the following equation
by using ρAu = 19.3 and ρSn = 7.3 (that of pure Sn)
cAu(wt.%) = 198
d
r
. (3)
Eq. (3) shows that, with the same d, Au concentration
increases as the dimension of a joint, r, becomes smaller. In
the size scale of BGA (r ∼ 200 μm), cAu can easily be kept
below the safety threshold for Au embrittlement (∼ 0.2 wt.%)
by keeping the Au thickness thinner than 0.2 μm. In the size
scale of flip chip solder joints (r ∼ 50 μm), Au embrittlement
still can be avoided by keeping d below 50 nm. For 3-D IC
micro joints (r ∼ 10 μm), Au thickness has to be smaller than
10 nm in order to have cAu < 0.2 wt.%. Nevertheless, for
practical purposes, d cannot become thinner than a certain value
(∼ 20 nm) without losing its effectiveness when the immersion
process is used. In other words, when the joint size r is smaller
than 20 μm, cAu becomes higher than the 0.2 wt.% threshold
level for Au embrittlement.
Fig. 7(a) shows a Ni/Sn1.8Ag (20 μm)/Au(20 nm)/
Pd(50 nm)/Ni structure after a 30 s reflow at 250 ◦C. The Au
and Pd layers had completely disappeared from the interface
during reflow, and dissolved into the solder. These Pd and
Au atoms formed a quaternary compound (Au, Pd, Ni)Sn4,
dispersed within the solder. In addition, a layer of Ni3Sn4
existed at both the solder/Ni interfaces. After 75 h of aging
at 150 ◦C, as shown in Fig. 7(b), about one half of the Sn
phase had been replaced by this quaternary compound. In other
words, if the Sn layer had been only 10 μm, instead of 20 μm
thick, the entire solder joint would have been occupied by
(Au, Pd, Ni)Sn4, which is known to be a very brittle phase.
Previous studies of Au embrittlement in BGA packages indicate
that (Au, Pd, Ni)Sn4 would form continuous layers over Ni3Sn4
upon further aging, further degrading the mechanical properties
of the solder joints [25], [28]. Literature results show that the
presence of Cu, either from alloying element in solder or from
the dissolution of Cu UBM, is able to inhibit the formation
of (Au, Pd, Ni)Sn4, at least at the BGA or flip chip size scale.

However, further study is needed to verify if this approach also
works for micro solder joints for 3-D IC applications.
VII. ISSUE (F): VOLUME SHRINKAGE DUE TO REACTION
In the reaction between Sn and a metal, often there is a net
volume shrinkage when IMC(s) form. The theoretical shrinkage
values can be calculated given the molar volumes of IMCs
and those of the pure elements. The molar volumes for Cu,
Ni, and Sn are 7.1, 6.6, and 16.3 cm3/mol, respectively [30].
The molar volumes for Cu6Sn5, Cu3Sn, and Ni3Sn4 are 117.8,
34.8, and 75.3 cm3/mol, respectively [31]. From these data, the
theoretical volume changes for various soldering reactions are
calculated and listed in Table I. For example, when 3 moles of
Ni react with 4 moles of Sn to form 1 more of Ni3Sn4, the ratio

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The configuration of the solder joints used in this
study is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. The
UBM comprised a trilayer structure of sputter-
deposited Al/Ni(V)/Cu wherein the Cu and Ni(V)
layers were 0.8 lm and 0.3 lm thick, respectively.
The diameter of the contact window was 90 lm. The
solder was eutectic Sn-Pb, and the solder joint had a
nominal diameter of 125 lm. On the substrate side,
a Au/Ni surface finish was used wherein the Au and
Ni layers were 0.1 lm and 5 lm thick, respectively.
During the electromigration test, the test vehicles
were aged at 150C using a 0.32 A current, result-
ing in a nominal current density of 5 9 103 A/cm2.
The solder joints were cross-sectioned through the
middle of the contact window for SEM observation.
Furthermore, a focused ion beam (FIB) was used to
prepare TEM specimens. Conventional TEM and
STEM at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV yielded
bright-field (BF) and dark-field (DF) images. Com-
positional analyses were achieved via EDX analysis
using STEM. Fast Fourier transforms (FFT) of the
HRTEM images were used to obtain calculated dif-
fraction patterns (FFT patterns).
RESULTS
The microstructure evolution of the Ni(V) UBM of
the tested samples during electromigration has
been described in detail elsewhere.5–8 This evolu-
tion is briefly summarized in Fig. 1b. The original
Ni(V) UBM first transforms into so-called consumed
Ni(V), then this consumed Ni(V) transforms into a
so-called porous structure.5–8 The consumed Ni(V)
has been termed ‘‘white patch’’ in some studies.2
The porous structure was composed of an amor-
phous matrix and crystalline phases comprising
very fine grains.8 Figure 1c, d presents SEM images
that show the microstructure of Ni(V) stressed for
150 h and 300 h, respectively. These images illus-
trate the morphologies of the consumed Ni(V) and
the porous structure under SEM observation.
Transmission electron microscopy specimens for
the porous structure region were then prepared
using FIB. Figure 2a presents a TEM BF image
showing three major layers: Al, porous structure,
and IMC. This IMC was (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, as discussed
in previous studies.5–8 A relatively thin but contin-
uous layer can be seen between the Al layer and the
porous structure layer. Figure 2b shows the related
DF image for the region shown in Fig. 2a. The inset
to Fig. 2b shows the selected-area diffraction pat-
tern (SADP) derived carefully from this continuous
layer. Both of these TEM images strongly suggest
that an additional continuous phase is located
between the Al layer and the porous structure layer.
To determine the compositional information for
this layer, STEM was used to analyze the elemental
distribution from the Al layer to the IMC layer.
Figure 3a shows a high-angle annular dark field
(HAADF) image used to perform the EDX line scan
analysis. The analysis was performed along the
arrow denoted in this image. Figure 3b shows the
line scan results for each main element in this range
(Al, Ni, V, Cu, Sn, and O, respectively). Owing to the
consumption of Ni(V), as discussed in previous
studies,5–8 almost no Ni signal was detected within
the porous structure. However, an abrupt Ni signal

NiAl3 phase. The zone axes for the insets at the
lower-right corners of Fig. 5a, b were [100] and
[110], respectively. The NiAl3 phase exhibits an
orthorhombic cementite D011 (oP16) structure with
Pnma space group.13,14 The experimental lattice
parameters at room temperature are a = 6.5982 A˚,
b = 7.3515 A˚, and c = 4.8021 A˚.13 The D011 struc-
ture has limited slip systems; hence, NiAl3 is very
brittle.14 This corresponds with the results of
Liu et al.11
DISCUSSION
During the solid-state annealing of Al/Ni thin
films, it was reported that NiAl3 was the first crys-
talline phase to form.15–17 Rothhaar et al. pointed
out that NiAl3 would be the first intermetallic phase
nucleated in the interdiffused regions while sput-
tering Al/Ni multilayers under annealing at 160C.
Moreover, the NiAl3 phase was stable at around
160C to 180C.18 In our study, the ambient tem-
perature was 150C, and the local Joule heating
effect during electromigration would further
increase the temperature.

PCB)。而隨著製程技術的進步，與電子產品輕薄、短小、高功能的要求，採用面的方式排
列之銲點矩陣來進行連接已成為當今主流，從外層封裝的球矩陣式封裝（Ball Grid Array, 
BGA），到內層封裝的 IC 製程中的覆晶（Flip chip, FC）製程技術都是這種例子。這些銲
點的品質對整體成品的良率有直接的影響。事實上，只要電子產品內數以千計的任一銲點
失效，都會造成整個電子產品的故障，因此相關電子產業對銲點可靠性的重視程度與日俱
增。而銲點與基材進行銲接時，銲料會與基材上的金屬發生化學反應，進而在界面生成一
或多種介金屬，這些介金屬對銲點的可靠度影響甚鉅。因此，欲提升銲點可靠度，必須了
解銲點與基材間的界面反應。 
鉛錫銲料一直是微電子工業最主要，且最常用的銲料。然而鉛會對人體及環境造成毒害，
也因此過去各國一直有禁用含鉛銲料的呼聲。事實上歐盟已決定要在 2006 年全面禁用含
鉛銲料。屆時各國所生產的含鉛產品，將無法再前往該地區來銷售。電子工業一直是我國
經濟中最重要的一項產業，歐洲亦是我國主要的銷售市場之ㄧ。我國的電子產業若要能長
久發展，無鉛製成的開發與研究已是當前所必須面對的。無鉛銲料的種類繁多，其中 SnAgCu
