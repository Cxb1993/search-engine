中文摘要 
在今天這個資訊化的時代，人們前所未有地依賴著寬頻通訊帶給我們的應用，各種不同的網路應
用正為我們的生活帶來改變。為了最經濟有效地滿足各種通訊應用的各種不同頻寬需求，多種正在使
用或發展中的通訊技術都有它們自己的特點及優勢。在不同通訊技術之間的比較，可以透過其數據傳
輸速度以及最遠的傳輸距離來分析，其中，光通訊系統支援 Tbps(每秒 1012位元)超過數千公里，這也
是為何光通訊始終是高容量數據網路中最理想的技術，當然每種技術的邊界是受到技術不斷演進而改
變的，而推動傳輸速度以及傳輸距離持續增加的就是不斷增加的網路頻寬需求，以及渴望在頻寬增加
的同時降低傳輸服務所需付出價格。 
隨著技術的演進，光訊號從最傳統的強度調變來到各種進階的調變格式，過去礙於高速元件製造
技術的限制，調制格式上僅僅利用了最簡單的二元強度調變，正式名稱為開關移鍵，數位訊號的 1 與
0 就以光波訊號強度的開與關來表達。然而，光波的物理性質除了振幅之外，尚有相位、頻率、偏極
態此三種性質，也就能調變並加載訊號的自由度尚有三種；波長多工已經利用了頻率(對應特定波長)
這個性質，偏極態則是允許我們在正交的偏極態上再加上另一道頻率相同的通道而不互相干擾。至於
相位，則成了開關移鍵之外的各種進階調制格式中重要的自由度：強度的訊號可以同時加上相位變化
來增加傳輸表現，例如：雙二元訊號；訊息也可以純粹載在相位上，例如：相位移鍵、正交相位移鍵；
或者同時在相位、強度兩個維度上載上數位訊號，例如：正交振幅調變。而近年無論在無線或有線通
訊中十分重要的正交頻率複用，它由多個互相正交的低速次載子來構成，除了能對抗光纖中的色散問
題，緊密排列的次載子亦提升了頻譜效率。然而，相位雜訊對於這些進階調製格式的影響就顯得非常
重要。本計畫研究了相位雜訊對訊號的影響，並提出了解決、壓抑相位雜訊來提升系統表現的方法，
截至目前共計已有四篇國際期刊[1-4]、六篇國際會議論文被接受，其中兩篇國際會議論文為受邀發表
之論文，另有兩篇國際期刊論文正在審查中，證明本計畫對於學術界的貢獻顯著；且此計畫所提出之
相位雜訊壓制方法，具有高度的創新及實用價值，相信對未來光通訊發展具一定的影響力。 
特別是當光載 60-GHz無線訊號與光接取網路結合時，光訊號在光纖中傳送時，色散將會引起來自
雷射相位雜訊的差分相位雜訊，本計畫不僅分析該現象的成果，由於此雜訊並非呈現高斯分布，傳統
分析方式並不適用，因此計畫成果中更提供了一種簡易的方法評估此相位雜訊的影響；在接收端則運
用了訊號處理的方式來降低此相位雜訊造成的損耗，完全不需在系統中增加額外的硬體，而達到了訊
號品質的提升及傳輸距離的增加;以 25.78-Gbps的光載 60-GHz無線正交頻率複用訊號而言，當光源為
一般商用的 DFB 雷射，應用此計畫的方法可以增加超過 50%的傳輸距離，使最大傳輸距離突破 100 公
里，這對未來接取網路的整合性發展非常重要。

前言與研究目的 
Wireless communication at 60-GHz band has attracted much attention due to up to 7-GHz unlicensed 
spectrum for popular bandwidth-hungry applications, such as High-Definition (HD) video [5]. Nevertheless, 
the significantly high air-link loss at 60 GHz (8~8.5 dB/m in modern office building) will severely limit the 
wireless transmission distance to less than ~10 m [6]. Accordingly, capacious feeders are required to facilitate 
wireless access. Recently, the radio-over-fiber (RoF) system has been considered as a promising candidate to 
provide the required feeder network due to low loss and almost unlimited bandwidth of optical fiber [7-8]. 
However, one of the major challenges of 60 GHz RoF system is the limitation of fiber transmission distance. 
The range of 60 GHz RoF system is limited to tens of kilometers, which is mainly owing to fading and 
time-shifting effects induced by fiber chromatic dispersion [9]. Such short reach of 60 GHz RoF access 
system will give rise to higher cost of network deployment. To extent the coverage, several 60 GHz RoF 
architectures have been proposed to overcome fading and time-shifting effects, which simultaneously transmit 
an RF-tone and optical data-modulated signal with 60-GHz frequency difference over fiber [7]. The beating 
term between them after a photo-detector is the desired electrical radio signals at 60-GHz band. To eliminate 
the phase noise (PN) caused by laser linewidth, both the RF-tone and the optical data-modulated signal are 
generated by modulating the same laser, and theoretically, laser PN will not affect the received 60 GHz 
signals [10]. However, the phase coherence between them is reduced after dispersive fiber transmission. 
Therefore, the dispersion-induced PN on electrical 60-GHz signals is generated after photo-detection  
Recently, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered as a prominent format 
for a variety of digital communication systems owing to its robustness against frequency selective fading and 
inter-symbol interference caused by both multipath in air-link and chromatic dispersion in optical fibers [11]. 
Besides, highly spectral efficiency and flexibility of OFDM makes it attractive for narrowband applications 
(i.e. 7-GHz license-free band at 60 GHz) beyond the 10-Gb/s regime. However, an OFDM signal is very 
sensitive to PN which will destroy the orthogonality among subcarriers. Hence, the dispersion-induced PN 
from nonzero laser linewidth causes not only phase rotation (PRT) on each subcarrier but also intercarrier 
interference (ICI) among subcarriers [10,12] to greatly reduce the fiber transmission distance. In particular, 
due to the increasing interest in optically amplified long-reach passive optical networks (PONs) [13], the 
required reach of a hybrid RoF/PON system which is expected to provide various services is up to 100 km.  
In this work, by simplifying the profile of dispersion, we use the algorithm from the area of wireless 
communication [14] to estimate and suppress both PRT and ICI. Compared with the work proposed in [15], 
the proposed PN suppression (PNS) algorithm does not require any bandwidth-consuming pilot tones to allow 
full utilization of 7-GHz unlicensed band at 60 GHz. Experimental results show that the algorithm can 
suppress the performance degradation caused by dispersion-induced PN to extend the transmission distance 
and/or to reduce the requirement of laser linewidth. Employing the algorithm, the 25.78-Gbps 16-QAM 
OFDM signals at 60 GHz can reach the BER of 2  10
-3
 after 100-km transmission, and the extension of 
transmission distance is more than 40 km using the laser with 1.3 or 1.8-MHz linewidth.

i. making hard decision on the received signal to “guess” what the transmitted signal is  
ii. estimating the PN from the received signal and the guessed transmitted signal by Eq. (5) 
iii. removing the PN from the received signal by Eq. (6)

While the frequency response of the 60-GHz RoF system is not flat and shows the deviation of up to 10 
dB, the subcarriers with worse error performance will deteriorate the performance of the whole system [16]. 
Fortunately, the performances of subcarriers can be equalized to optimize the system performance by 
adjusting the powers and/or modulation levels of individual subcarriers independently.  For instance, to reach 
a universal target bit-error rate (BER), higher power and/or lower modulation level can be allocated to a 
subcarrier with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and vice versa. Therefore, giving a target BER and measured 
SNRs, a maximum capacity can be achieved via applying the LC algorithm to allocate specific power and 
modulation levels to subcarriers. Notably, since the power of PN depends on fiber CD, the SNRs of 
subcarriers would vary with fiber distances. Hence, the allocation needs to be modified at different distances, 
resulting in different capacities. 
 
結果與討論 
The experimental setup of an OFDM RoF system at 60-GHz band is shown in Fig. 2 [17]. The optical source 
is a DFB laser at 1555 nm, and its linewidth depends on the laser output power. In our experiment, the laser 
output powers of 10.5 dBm and 8.5 dBm are adopted, resulting in the measured linewidths of 1.3 MHz and 
 8 
10 and 16. Furthermore, Fig. 4 depicts the BER curves after 115-km fiber with and without the iterative PNS 
algorithm. Without any PNS, the signal cannot reach the FEC threshold (BER of 2 10
-3
), but the BER is 
improved to lower than 2 10
-3
 with the proposed algorithm for both cases of 10.5-dBm and 8.5-dBm laser 
output power. Since the third iteration only provides little improvement as show in Fig. 4, three iterations 
approximately reach the best performance. Furthermore, the results employing ideal PNS with the perfect 
knowledge of Sm are also plotted for comparison, and the applied values of L are identical to those used in the 
first iteration. The further improvement by ideal PNS comes from the absence of error propagation, compared 
with the other iterative cases. However, the BERs employing ideal PNS are still worse than the case without 
dispersion-induced PN (B-to-B, with only air transmission), because of two assumptions made in the 
algorithm: 1) the bandwidth of ICI is limited to L, and 2) OFDM subcarriers are completely coherent after 
transmission. Therefore, the performance gap between the signals without PN and with PN suppressed by 
iterative PNS comes from both the incomplete knowledge of Sm and the assumptions of the algorithm. 
Figure 5 plots the relative power penalty to reach the BER of 2 10
-3
 as a function of fiber distance before 
and after three time iterative PNS or ideal PNS. For both the cases of 10.5-dBm and 8.5-dBm laser output 
powers, their maximum transmission distances to reach the BER of 2  10
-3
 can be extended beyond 100 km 
by the proposed PNS scheme to meet the distance requirement of long-reach PONs. Using 3-dB power 
penalty as a criterion, ~50% transmission distance increment can be obtained via iterative PNS, as shown in 
Fig. 5. Moreover, when the fiber distance is shorter than 50 km, since the contribution of the 
dispersion-induced PN to total noise at the concerned BER of ~2  10
-3
 is relatively small, the

Moreover, when the bit-loading algorithm is applied to investigate the maximum capacities at the function 
of transmission distances and laser linewidths, the experimental results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. For the 
back-to-back case (only 3-m air-link), the maximum capacity with the bit-loading algorithm is 29 Gbps 
irrelevant to the laser linewidth. Nevertheless, after fiber transmission, the received SNR decreases due to the 
linewidth-relevant PN. Therefore, the modulation levels must be lowered to reach the target BER of 10
-3
. Fig. 
6(a) shows the modulation levels, the relative power levels, and the SNR of subcarriers with 1.3-MHz 
linewidth and 100-km fiber transmission. The total data rate is only 22.76 Gbps. The unequal power levels of 
subcarriers with the same modulation level are mainly caused by uneven frequency responses of electrical 
components at 60-GHz band. Furthermore, because the PNS algorithm can lower BER, the target BER of the 
LC algorithm can be set higher to achieve the same BER of 10
-3
 after PNS. Hence, compared with Fig. 6(a), 
the results with PNS in Fig. 6(b) show very different modulation and power levels, and its capacity is up to 
26.54 Gbps. Notably, due to the intermodulation distortion of electronics and MZMs, the SNR will deviate 
from the expected levels. As a result, the SNRs in Fig. 6 are not step-like, but their trends approximately 
correspond to their modulation levels. With the bit-loading algorithm, the maximum transmission capacities 
with and without PNS are plotted in Fig. 7 as functions of laser linewidths and fiber distances. The PNS 
algorithm does not improve the transmission capacity with the fiber distance of less than 25 km due to the 
relatively small contribution of the CD-induced PN to total noise at the concerned BER [15]. However, after 
longer transmission, higher PN power is induced to result in lower capacity, but more improvement can be 
accomplished by the PNS. After 100-km transmission, the capacities without the PNS are decreased by 21.5%, 
23.8%, 32.8%, and 41.3% for the linewidths of 1.3 MHz, 1.8 MHz, 2.5 MHz, and 4.1 MHz, respectively. 
Compared with the cases without PNS, applying the PNS can increase the capacities by 16.6%, 15.7%, 17.6%, 
and 15.3%. 
 
結論 
In conclusion, a PNS algorithm is proposed to eliminate both PRT and ICI caused by the dispersion-induced 
PN in an OFDM RoF system at 60-GHz band. Thanks to the proposed algorithm, a commercial DFB laser 
with < 2-MHz linewidth could be applied to transmit 16-QAM OFDM RoF signals at 60-GHz band at the 
transmission distance of >100 km. For 25.78-Gbps 16-QAM OFDM signals generated by the laser with the 
linewidths of 1.3 MHz and 1.8 MHz, the proposed algorithm can extend the maximum fiber transmission 
distances corresponding to 3-dB power penalty from 75 km and 90 km to 115 km and ~135 km, resulting in 
~50% improvement of transmission distance. When both the bit-loading and the PNS algorithms are 
employed to obtain the maximum transmission capacity, a 26.54-Gbps OFDM RoF signal can achieve the 
BER of 10
-3
 over 100-km fiber and 3-m wireless transmission. Furthermore, compared with the cases with 
only the bit-loading algorithm, the PNS can increase the acceptable modulation levels with the result of higher 
capacities. As the laser linewidth is 1.3~4.1 MHz, due to the CD-induced PN, the capacity is reduced by more 
than 21.5% after 100-km fiber, and using the PNS scheme can enhance it by more than 15.3%.

positive chirp reduces the bandwidth of an OFDM transmission system over standard SMF. As a result, the 3-dB 
bandwidth of a transmission system can be given as,  
    
  
            √     
      
    (1) 
While   of a commercial DFB laser is generally larger than 6, 
the corresponding bandwidth after 100-km SMF is less than 
about 1.1 GHz implying that a very high order QAM format 
must be employed to transmit signals at the data rate of 10 
Gbps or beyond. Hence, an EML (or EAM) with   < 1 is more 
suitable for a cost-efficient long-reach OFDM-PON. Via a 
network analyzer, we show in Fig. 1 the measured frequency 
responses of an EAM-based transmission system over 100-km 
SMF under different bias voltages. Notably, the first null point 
of the frequency response,      , can be used to estimate the 
bias-dependent chirp parameter through the equality of 
           
           ⁄  [9]. From Fig. 1, the system 
bandwidth strongly depends on the bias voltage, and the 
bandwidth can be even larger than that of a chirp-free system 
when bias voltage is smaller than ~  1.5 V. Since the 
bandwidth is not the only concern to the signal performance, in 
the following section, we present our EAM-based OFDM 
transmission system to evaluate the transmission performance.

3.  Experimental results 
The experimental setup for an OFDM transmission system over 100-km SMF is shown in Fig. 2. We adopt a point-
to-point transmission to emulate a long-reach OFDM-PON, since the loss of a remote note in PONs can be 
compensated by an optical amplifier. The baseband electrical OFDM signal is generated by a Tektronix®  AWG7102 
arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) using the Matlab®  program. The signal processing of the OFDM transmitter 
consists of serial-to-parallel conversion, QAM symbol encoding, inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), cyclic prefix 
(CP) insertion, and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC).  The sampling rate and DAC resolution of the AWG are set 
to be 12 GHz and 8 bits, respectively. The OFDM signal contains 128 subcarriers of 128-QAM format to occupy 3-
GHz bandwidth with a fast-Fourier transform (FFT) size of 512, yielding a total data rate of 21 Gbps. An EAM is 
used to generate an optical DSB OFDM signal without a guard band. After transmission in SMF and direct-detection, 
the received electrical signal is captured by a Tektronix®  DPO 71254 with the 50-Gb/s sampling rate and the 3-dB 
bandwidth of 12.5 GHz. The off-line DSP program is used to demodulate the vector signal, and the demodulation 
process includes synchronization, FFT, one-tap equalization, and QAM symbol decoding. Lastly, the bit error rate 
(BER) performance is calculated from the measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 
In Fig. 3, we display the amplitude and phase characteristics of the EAM, and the linear electrical-to-optical 
(E/O) conversion region is between  1.1 V and 0.5 V. Within this region, the measured chirp parameter is from 
0.3 to 1.2, and the corresponding transmission bandwidth at 100-km SMF is from 3.5 GHz to 2.4 GHz. Accordingly, 
the transmission bandwidth at 100-km SMF could be a critical issue for our 3-GSymbol/s signal, when the electrical 
signal is operated in this linear E/O conversion region. Furthermore, to evaluate the signal performance, Figs. 4(a) 
and (b) depict the measured SNR of every OFDM subcarrier with and without transmission. While both the bias 
voltage and the subcarrier power weighting are optimized at back-to-back, the operational bias voltage is  0.8 V, 
which is about the center of the linear E/O conversion region. However, as shown in Fig. 4(a), after 100-km SMF 
transmission, the subcarriers at high frequency suffer severe SNR penalty and fail to achieve the FEC threshold 
(BER         ) [10]. This implies a trade-off problem between bandwidth and E/O conversion linearity. For 
example, a bias voltage of <  0.8 V yields wider transmission bandwidth, however, at the expense of lower 
conversion linearity. Therefore, the bias voltage should be slightly reduced to obtain wider bandwidth and better 
transmission performance at 100-km SMF. By optimizing the subcarrier power weighting at 100 km and reducing 
the bias voltage to -0.93 V, we show the measured SNR in Fig. 4(b) which demonstrates that the subcarriers at high 
frequency suffer less SNR penalty compared to that in Fig. 4(a), and all the subcarriers achieve the FEC threshold 
within 100-km transmission. The BER performance of the EAM-based OFDM signal is plotted in Fig. 5, with the

Abstract: For OFDM RoF systems at 60-GHz band, dispersion-induced phase noise (PN) could 
heavily degrade transmission performance. We propose an algorithm to suppress PN and 
experimentally demonstrate the algorithm can extend the transmission distance by >60%.

1. Introduction 
To feed the bandwidth-hungry demand of wireless communications, millimeter-wave has been considered a good 
candidate to transmit higher capacity, such as the carrier of 60 GHz with ~7-GHz unlicensed band [1]. While such 
frequency bands suffer high loss in air-link, their cell-sizes are very small (radius of ~10 m for 60-GHz band) [2]. 
Accordingly, capacious feeders are required to extend wireless access range, and low-loss optical fibers can be used 
to transmit wireless signals in the optical form in radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems to lower the complexity of wireless 
access [3,4]. Moreover, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising modulation format for a 
variety of digital communication systems owing to its robustness against frequency selective fading and inter-
symbol interference (ISI) caused by both multipath in air-link and chromatic dispersion in optical fibers [5]. 
However, an OFDM signal is very sensitive to phase noise (PN) which can not only disturb subcarriers but also 
destroy the orthogonality among subcarriers. To transmit 60-GHz OFDM signals in fibers, an RF-tone and optical 
OFDM signals with 60-GHz frequency difference have to be sent into fiber simultaneously, and their beating term 
after a photo-detector is the desired electrical radio signals at 60-GHz band. Without transmission, the performance 
of received electrical signals is irrelevant to the laser linewidth, when both the RF-tone and OFDM signals are 
generated by the same laser. However, the phase coherence between the OFDM subcarriers and the RF-tone is 
losing in fiber due to their different group velocities, and therefore, PN is generated in detection [6,7]. Consequently, 
adopting a cost-effective commercial DFB laser with linewidth of several MHz in OFDM RoF systems will 
dramatically limit the maximum transmission distance and degrade received signal performance. 
In this work, an algorithm is proposed to estimate and suppress both phase rotation (PRT) and intercarrier 
interference (ICI) caused by PN without the requirement of pilot tones. In the algorithm, dispersion-induced relative 
time delays of the OFDM subcarriers are assumed equal to simplify the PN issue. We also experimentally 
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effective lower the PN-related penalty and extend the transmission 
distance by more than 60%.

As shown in Fig. 1, wireless signals at 60 GHz can be integrated into access systems, such as passive optical 
networks (PONs) [8] to provide various services. Since there has been increasing interest in extended-reach optically 
amplified PONs or so-called long-reach PONs, the required reach of the hybrid RoF/PON system is up to 100 km. 
However, when fiber dispersion can de-correlate the RF-tone and the OFDM subcarriers via different group 
velocities, their walk-off in the time domain will result in differential PN, as shown in Fig. 2. While  ( ) denotes

the laser output power of (a) 8.5 dBm and (b) 6.5 dBm. (PNS: phase 
noise suppression algorithm) 
 
 
    Fig. 4 Power penalty as a function of transmission distance with 
the laser output power of (a) 8.5 dBm and (b) 6.5 dBm. 
Consequently, Eqs. (1) and (2) must be modified by setting  ̃ (   ) and   ̃ (   ), of which |   |   , as zero. 
Besides,  ̃ (   ), of which |〈   〉     |   , should also be set as zero, and this also results in a modified 
version of   ̃ . Besides, the parameter of   can be optimized by long training symbols in advance, and the value is 
fixed once transmission distance and laser parameters are determined.  
According to the experimental results, the optimized value of   is mostly between 10 and 15 and gradually 
increases after longer transmission distance due to the larger bandwidth of ICI [6]. Notably, further increasing   
does not help the reduction of BER due to the error propagation from  ̃ 
( )
 to  ̃ 
(   )
. Figure 2 shows the BER with 
iterative PN suppression algorithm of 0~3 times after 75-km SMF transmission and the BER at back-to-back 
without PN. Since changing laser power will result in different laser spectra and PN power, two output laser powers 
of 8.5 and 6.5 dBm are adopted in our experiment for comparison. With 8.5-dBm laser power, the signal barely 
reaches the BER of 10-3 without any PN suppression. With the proposed algorithm, the BER is improved and the 
received power required to reach the BER of 10-3 is also reduced. Furthermore, the 3rd iterative PN suppression 
improves the performance little implying that 3 times of PN suppression is about the best result. For 6.5-dBm laser 
output power, the signal cannot reach the BER of 10-3 before PN suppression, and the BER can be reduced to less 
than 10-3 after applying the proposed algorithm. Considering the received power required to reach the BER of 10-3, 
the relative power penalty is shown as a function of transmission distance in Fig. 4. While the laser output power is 
8.5 dBm, its maximum transmission distance is ~75 km, and using the proposed algorithm can extend the maximum 
transmission distance to more than 100 km to fit the distance requirement of long-reach PONs. Besides, if the laser 
output power is 6.5 dBm, the BER of 10-3 is achievable after 100-km transmission with the proposed algorithm, but 
75-km transmission is not even allowed without any PN suppression. As a result, using 4-dB power penalty as a 
criterion, more than 60% transmission distance improvement can be obtained via the proposed PN suppression 
algorithm. 
4.  Conclusion 
In conclusion, a PN suppression algorithm is proposed to compensate both PRT and ICI contributed by the 
dispersion-induced PN in an OFDM RoF system at 60-GHz band. Thanks to the proposed algorithm, a commercial 
DFB laser with 4.5-MHz linewidth could be applied to transmit optical radio signals at 60-GHz band over 
transmission distance of >100 km. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that iterative PN suppression can 
increase transmission distance by more than 60%.
