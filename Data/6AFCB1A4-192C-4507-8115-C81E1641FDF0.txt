二、研究目的 
    在圖一中，氧化段與脫硝段所釋出的熱可與煙道氣冷卻段爐管中的水進行熱交換以產
生過熱蒸汽並供給其它設備使用，由於氧化段與脫硝段的操作溫度相當高（可達1200℃），
因此，會產生如表一與表二所述之一氧化碳鍋爐內外部問題，其停車檢查維修所造成的生
產線損失每日以億元起計，而其所潛藏的工安與環保問題更是不容忽視，輕則造成設備的
損壞而導致生產線停擺，重則造成人員的傷亡與環境的污染，因此，一氧化碳鍋爐氧化段
與脫硝段的操作良窳對於相關產業生產運作的影響非常鉅大，而本計畫的目的正是希望設
計出高效率、高安全性且低污染的一氧化碳鍋爐氧化段與脫硝段，以提昇國內相關產業（如
石化業、鋼鐵業、機械業等）的水準。

1. Introduction 
Burners are the most important element of combustion systems such as boilers, 
heaters, furnaces or incinerators. The main function of a burner is to create heat 
energy through combustion. The heat energy can then be converted to kinetic energy 
in other equipment, such as a turbine, or used to produce steam via heat exchanger use 
in manufacturing processes. Lee et al. [1] used a simplified model of a heat exchanger 
and pilot condensing boiler to investigate the design factors for a heat exchanger and 
boiler. Specifications of each heat exchanger component were investigated using a 
model apparatus, and the comprehensive performance of the pilot gas boiler was 
examined experimentally. The heating efficiency of the boiler developed was 
compared to a conventional Bunsen-type boiler. Main and Maghon [2] presented 
different measures for an optimized boiler, evaluating six important parameters: 
reduction of excess air, flue gas temperature at boiler outlet, higher steam parameters 
(pressure and temperature), heating surfaces for steam superheating in the radiation 
boiler section, steam reheating, and external superheaters using auxiliary fuels. Franco 
and Diaz [3] described the state of the art in the field of ‘‘clean coal technologies’’ 
showing the perspectives of improvement and the critical elements. They reviewed 
and analyzed both the emission control of NOx, SOx, and particle matter as well as 
advanced coal conversion pathways such as ultra-supercritical (USC), pressurized 
fluidized bed combustion (PFBC), and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). 
This paper also outlined some aspects of CO2 emission control strategies. Shin et al. 
[4] developed a comprehensive computer program using the SIMPLE algorithm by 
Patankar to evaluate the efficiency of a selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) 
system for a boiler. The standard k-ε turbulence model and eddy breakup model were 
incorporated to analyze the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent reaction of major fuel 
species, respectively. Their calculations showed that the removal efficiency of NO 
was significantly improved by increasing penetration depth of the reducing agent into 
the center region of boiler. Javed et al. [5] presented a review of NOx removal 
techniques with particular reference to SNCR technology. A review of various 
features related to selective non-catalytic gas phase injection of ammonia and 
ammonium salts (as reducing agent) was presented. Computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) modeling was also applied to SNCR. In addition, a two-stage NOx removal 
strategy to control un-reacted ammonia slip and to improve overall efficiency was 
discussed and a summary highlighted various areas needing further research was

be ruptured due to the high temperature in the DeNOx section (Figure 2). The loss 
caused by the shutdown/inspection/maintenance of a CO boiler can be as high as 
hundreds of million US$ per day. Furthermore, the potential threats to human safety 
and the environment are significant. Consequently, the performance of a CO boiler 
has an important influence on the operation and production of related industries.  
 
(Fig. 2.  Rupture of the refractory in the DeNOx section) 
 
The flow field in a CO boiler involves many complicated mechanisms, such as 
turbulent mixing, convection and radiation heat transfer modes, combustion, as well 
as DeNOx and DeSOx reactions. These mechanisms are all highly complex and may 
interact with each other, which makes the analysis much more difficult. Therefore, in 
this paper, we present a numerical investigation focused on the heat transfer and fluid 
flow in a CO boiler. The effects of combustion, DeNOx and DeSOx reactions are 
retained for future studies. The influences of some important parameters related to the 
geometry of a CO boiler are also discussed, including the refractory thickness (Fig.12) 
and the insertion of an ellipsoidal cone (Fig.17). The purpose of this paper is to 
explore the heat transfer and fluid flow in a CO boiler and to improve its performance, 
especially to alleviate hot spots, which may lead to deterioration of the refractory. 
 
2. Numerical Methods  
This study uses a CO boiler of the Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (FPC) in Taiwan 
as the model for numerical investigation. The configuration and dimensions of the CO 
boiler investigated are shown below. 
 
(Fig. 3.  Configuration and dimension of the CO boiler investigated) 
 
In a practical petroleum refinery, a stack is used for the emission of waste gas to the 
atmosphere and has little influence on the reaction inside a boiler. Therefore, in the 
configuration of the CO boiler investigated shown in Fig.3, the stack is ignored in 
order to reduce the memory required and computing time.  
In this study, the FLUENT commercial code [9] is employed to simulate the heat 
transfer and fluid flow in the FPC CO boiler. The SIMPLE algorithm by Patankar [10] 
is used to solve the governing equations. The discretization of convection terms is

3.1.2 Three-dimensional polar cavity flow 
   Figure 6 shows the numerical model of the three-dimensional polar cavity flow 
[17]. The Reynolds number is 350 based on the radius of the rotating cylinder and the 
driving velocity. The diameter of the rotating cylinder is 95mm and its length（in the 
z-direction） is 400 mm. The radial walls are 47.5mm apart and the opening angle is 1 
radian. Five sets of uniform grid meshes（21x21x11, 33x33x17, 41x41x21, 51x51x26 
and 51x51x51 (r×θ×z)）are used to ensure grid independence. Figure 7 shows the 
comparison of the computed velocity profile with the experimental data at z=100mm
（1/4 the cavity length from the end wall）, θ=-20° for the three-dimensional polar 
cavity flow. Again, it is seen that the computational result is very close to the 
experimental data.

3.1.3 Three-dimensional natural convection in a differentially heated cubical 
enclosure 
Figure 8 shows the numerical model of the three-dimensional natural convection in 
a differentially heated cubical enclosure [18]. Two of the four vertical walls are kept 
at different temperatures, while the remaining four walls are insulated. The Rayleigh 
number is 10
5
. Fusegi et al. [18] simulated the flow with a very fine grid mesh
（62x62x62）. Grid independence of the numerical solution was verified in their study. 
In the present study, five sets of grid meshes（22x22x22, 32x32x32, 42x42x42, 
52x52x52, and 62x62x62）are used to ensure grid independence. Figure 9 compares 
the computed vertical velocity profile with the reference solution by Fusegi et al. at 
 15 
of 1681x201 is chosen for comparison with the experimental data. Figure 11 
compares the computed Nusselt number with the experimental data at the surfaces of 
the 5
th
 period of rib. In Fig.11, the present calculated result is compared with Lorenz’s 
experimental data [19] and Lee’s computational result [20]. It can be seen that the 
trends of the two computational results are consistent with the experimental data. 
However, because the present research has taken the radiation heat transfer into 
account, the calculated result is closer to the experimental data than Lee’s 
computational result, in which the radiation effect was not considered.

3.2 Effect of refractory thickening on a CO boiler 
Having evaluated the numerical methods, the following discussion investigates the 
FPC CO boiler. The simulation conditions are provided by Formosa Petrochemical 
Corporation, and the fluid is air, with inlet pressure of atmospheric pressure. At the 
primary air inlet, velocity is 5.885m/sec, temperature is 300K, turbulence kinetic 
energy is 10% of the inlet mean flow kinetic energy, and turbulence dissipation rate is 
computed from Eq.(24) with hydraulic diameter L=0.944m. At the secondary air inlet, 
velocity is 40.154m/sec, temperature is 300K, turbulence kinetic energy is 10% of the 
inlet mean flow kinetic energy, and turbulence dissipation rate is computed from 
Eq.(24) with hydraulic diameter L of either 0.2m or 0.25m (see Fig.3(e)). At the flue 
gas inlet, velocity is 13.35m/sec, temperature is 877K, turbulence kinetic energy is 
10% of the inlet mean flow kinetic energy, and turbulence dissipation rate is 
computed from Eq.(24) with hydraulic diameter L=0.912m. Heat absorption rate of 
the flue gas cooling pipes is 26,572 w/m
2
 and the other walls are adiabatic. No slip 
condition is applied at all solid walls. Atmosphere at the exit is taken as a cube with 
side length of twenty times the exit diameter of the DeSOx section. The atmosphere is 
at 300K and 1atm.  
In an actual CO boiler, deterioration of refractory on the wall of DeNOx section can 
occur, as shown in Fig.2. This phenomenon can cause serious damage to the boiler 
 17 
oxidizer and DeSOx sections and only the DeNOx section and flue gas cooler section 
are influenced more, Fig.14 compares cross-sectional average skin friction 
coefficients only in the DeNOx and flue gas cooler sections（x=8.7m~24.2m）. It can 
be seen that in the constant-area section (x=8.7m~10.96m), the skin friction 
coefficients for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory thickening 
nearly coincide. This is consistent with the result of Fig.13, which shows that 
refractory thickening has very little influence on the flow field in the oxidizer section. 
On the other hand, because the DeNOx section (x≧10.96m) is divergent (adverse 
pressure gradient）, the fluid decelerates and a recirculation zone forms (Fig.13(e), (f), 
(g), (h)). The thicker the refractory is, the smaller the adverse pressure gradient would 
be. Therefore, when the refractory is thickened, the skin friction coefficient arises 
later in the flow direction due to the lower adverse pressure gradient. In contrast, 
when the refractory is thinner, the skin friction coefficient arises earlier in the flow 
direction due to the larger adverse pressure gradient. In the neighborhood of the 
cooling pipes (x=24.2m), the skin friction coefficient arises abruptly due to the 
increase of solid surface area.  
 
(Fig. 14.  Comparison of cross-sectional average skin friction coefficients for 
original CO boiler and CO boiler with refractory thickening) 
 
Figure 15 shows the temperature profiles on the symmetric (z=0) and lateral 
(z=1.44m) planes for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory 
thickening. It can be seen that high temperature regions are concentrated in those 
regions where convective motion is weak, e.g. upper portion of the oxidizer section, 
DeNOx section, upstream region of the flue gas cooler section, and DeSOx section. 
These regions are all characterized by recirculation. Similar to Fig.13, refractory 
thickening has minor influence on the temperature profile in the oxidizer and DeSOx 
sections. Only the DeNOx section and the flue gas cooler section are influenced more. 
 
(Fig. 15.  Temperature profiles on the symmetric (z=0) and lateral (z=1.44m) 
planes for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory 
thickening) 
 19 
cooler section（downstream of the DeNOx section）are influenced more. The oxidizer 
section is upstream of the ellipsoidal cone and the DeSOx section is far from the 
ellipsoidal cone and therefore the ellipsoidal cone has little influence on the flow field 
in the oxidizer and DeSOx sections.  
In fluid mechanics, an ellipsoidal cone is a blunt body that forms a low-pressure 
wake flow region downstream. The wake flow is a region. The larger the ellipsoidal 
cone angle is, the larger the wake flow region would be. Figure 18 shows that the 
ellipsoidal cone interferes with the recirculation zone in the DeNOx section of the 
original CO boiler. This is because the flow passage in the DeNOx section becomes 
narrower due to the ellipsoidal cone and this leads to a stronger convective motion, 
which alleviates the recirculation strength in the DeNOx section. 
 
(Fig. 18.  Velocity vector profiles on the symmetric plane (z=0) for original CO 
boiler and CO boiler with ellipsoidal cone) 
 
Figure 19 compares cross-sectional average skin friction coefficients for the 
original CO boiler and the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone. Because Fig.18 shows 
that insertion of an ellipsoidal cone has little influence on the flow field in the 
oxidizer and DeSOx sections and only the DeNOx section and flue gas cooler section 
are influenced more, Fig.19 compares cross-sectional average skin friction 
coefficients only in the DeNOx and flue gas cooler sections（x=8.7m~24.2m）. It can 
be seen that in the constant-area section (x=8.7m~10.96m), the skin friction 
coefficient for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone is smaller, which is different 
from the case of refractory thickening in which the skin friction coefficients for the 
original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory thickening nearly coincide. This 
is because the fluid motion is slowed down by the ellipsoidal cone (from 
computational results, the average velocity is decreased by about 0.5% in the 
existence of an ellipsoidal cone). On the other hand, in the DeNOx section 
(x≧10.96m), the solid surface area increases due to the ellipsoidal cone. The larger 
the ellipsoidal cone angle is, the larger the solid surface area and therefore the larger 
the skin friction coefficient would be. In addition, the skin friction coefficient 
increases abruptly close to the support (x=18.09m) because of the increased solid 
surface area due to the support. The larger the ellipsoidal cone angle is, the shorter the 
 21 
 
Figure 21 compares the cross-sectional average temperature for the original CO 
boiler and the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone. Because both Fig.18 and Fig.20 
show that the ellipsoidal cone has only slight influence on the flow field in the 
oxidizer and DeSOx sections, Fig.21 compares cross-sectional average temperature 
only in the DeNOx and flue gas cooler sections（x=8.7m~24.2m）. It can be seen that 
in the constant-area section (x=8.7m~10.96m), in contrast to the case of refractory 
thickening, the temperature for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone is lower 
because the ellipsoidal cone can alleviate the recirculation strength. On the other hand, 
because the DeNOx section (x≧10.96m) is in the recirculation zone (adverse pressure 
gradient) where convective motion is weak, the heat dissipation is poor and therefore 
the temperature arises in the DeNOx section. Furthermore, the flow passage in the 
DeNOx section becomes narrower due to the ellipsoidal cone and this leads to a 
stronger convective motion, which alleviates the adverse pressure gradient and the 
recirculation strength. Therefore, insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can lower the 
cross-sectional average temperature in the DeNOx section. However, Fig.21 shows 
that as the ellipsoidal cone angle becomes very large, e.g. 60
o
 and 75
o
, the flow 
passage would be very narrow. This is not good for convective motion due to the 
blockage effect of the ellipsoidal cone. Under such situation, the cross-sectional 
average temperature in the DeNOx section is higher than for smaller ellipsoidal cone 
angles. After leaving the DeNOx section, the temperature drops due to the cooling 
pipes.  
 
(Fig. 21.  Comparison of cross-sectional average temperature for original CO 
boiler and CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone) 
 
3.4 Comparison of refractory thickening and insertion of an ellipsoidal cone  
Table 1 compares the average skin friction coefficient ( f
C
) and the average 
temperature (T ) in the DeNOx and flue gas cooler sections (x=8.7m~24.2m) for 
refractory thickening and insertion of an ellipsoidal cone. It can be seen that both the 
refractory thickening and insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can reduce the skin friction 
coefficient and temperature. The skin friction coefficient decreases with the refractory 
 23 
CO boiler. After leaving the DeNOx section, the temperature reduces due to the 
cooling pipes and the skin friction coefficient arises abruptly near the cooling 
pipes. 
2. Insertion of an ellipsoidal cone has little influence on the heat transfer and fluid 
flow in the oxidizer and DeSOx sections. In the constant-area section between the 
oxidizer and DeNOx sections, different from the case of refractory thickening, the 
skin friction coefficient for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone is smaller and 
the temperature is lower. On the other hand, in the DeNOx section, insertion of an 
ellipsoidal cone can lower the temperature and there is a larger skin friction 
coefficient with a larger ellipsoidal cone angle. However, as the ellipsoidal cone 
angle becomes very large, the temperature in the DeNOx section increases. 
Furthermore, the skin friction coefficient increases abruptly near support and this 
phenomenon is less severe for a larger ellipsoidal cone angle. After leaving the 
DeNOx section and entering the flue gas cooler section, the skin friction 
coefficient and the temperature both decrease. With a larger ellipsoidal cone angle, 
the skin friction coefficient drops more quickly. For the original CO boiler, the 
skin friction coefficient arises earlier in the flow direction. Near the cooling pipes, 
the skin friction coefficient arises abruptly and this phenomenon is less severe for 
the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone. 
3. Based on the result of this research and from a practical point of view, refractory 
thickening is a preferable choice for reducing friction and temperature in a CO 
boiler.

Abstract— A numerical investigation of the heat transfer and 
fluid flow in a Carbon Monoxide boiler is presented. The 
influences of some important parameters related to the geometry 
of a CO boiler are also discussed, including the refractory 
thickness and the insertion of an ellipsoidal cone. The purpose is 
to improve the performance of a CO boiler, especially to alleviate 
hot spots, which may lead to deterioration of the refractory. It is 
found that the skin friction coefficient arises earlier in the DeNOx 
section when the refractory is thinner. Refractory thickening 
leads to a lower temperature in the DeNOx section. After leaving 
the DeNOx section, the temperature reduces due to the cooling 
pipes and the skin friction coefficient arises abruptly near the 
cooling pipes. It is also found that insertion of an ellipsoidal cone 
can lower the temperature in the DeNOx section and there is a 
larger skin friction coefficient with a larger ellipsoidal cone angle. 
After leaving the DeNOx section, the skin friction coefficient and 
the temperature both decrease. Finally, based on the result of this 
research and from a practical point of view, refractory 
thickening is a preferable choice for reducing friction and 
temperature in a CO boiler.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Burners are the most important element of combustion 
systems such as boilers, heaters, furnaces or incinerators. The 
main function of a burner is to create heat energy through 
combustion. The heat energy can then be converted to kinetic 
energy in other equipment, such as a turbine, or used to 
produce steam via heat exchanger use in manufacturing 
processes. Lee et al. [1] used a simplified model of a heat 
exchanger and pilot condensing boiler to investigate the 
design factors for a heat exchanger and boiler. Specifications 
of each heat exchanger component were investigated using a 
model apparatus, and the comprehensive performance of the 
pilot gas boiler was examined experimentally. Main and 
Maghon [2] presented different measures for an optimized 
boiler, evaluating six important parameters: reduction of 
excess air, flue gas temperature at boiler outlet, higher steam 
parameters (pressure and temperature), heating surfaces for 
steam superheating in the radiation boiler section, steam 
reheating, and external superheaters using auxiliary fuels. Shin 
et al. [3] developed a comprehensive computer program using 
the SIMPLE algorithm by Patankar to evaluate the efficiency 
of a selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system for a 
boiler. Their calculations showed that the removal efficiency 
of NO was significantly improved by increasing penetration 
depth of the reducing agent into the center region of boiler. In 
2006, the American Petroleum Institute (API) [4] provided 
guidelines for the selection and/or evaluation of burners 
installed in fired heaters in general refinery services. This 
standard provides information and descriptions of burner types 
available to the designer/user for purposes of selecting the 
appropriate burner for a given application. In 1998, the API [5] 
provided guidelines covering the mechanical description, 
operation, maintenance, and test procedures of post-
combustion NOx control equipment for fired equipment in 
general refinery service. 
 
Figure 1.  Configuration of a CO boiler in a typical petroleum refinery 
 
CO boilers play an important role in the petroleum-refining 
process. The configuration of a CO boiler for a typical 
petroleum refinery is shown in Fig.1. A CO boiler is composed 
of oxidizer section, DeNOx section, flue gas cooler section, 
DeSOx section, and stack. The interior surface of a CO boiler 
is fabricated with refractory to protect its wall. The flue gas 
cooler section can be divided into screen/superheater section, 
vaporizer section, and economizer section. A CO boiler can 
retrieve thermal energy of CO from the regenerator for various 
uses. The boiler utilizes the burning gas (CO) from the 
regenerator as part of the fuel. The fuel burns and releases a 
large amount of heat. The hot flue gas then flows through the 
screen/superheater section and exchanges heat with the water

is 10% of the inlet mean flow kinetic energy, and turbulence 
dissipation rate is computed from Eq.(1) with hydraulic 
diameter L=0.912m. Heat absorption rate of the flue gas 
cooling pipes is 26,572 w/m2 and the other walls are 
adiabatic. No slip condition is applied at all solid walls. 
Atmosphere at the exit is taken as a cube with side length of 
twenty times the exit diameter of the DeSOx section. The 
atmosphere is at 300K and 1atm.  
In an actual CO boiler, deterioration of refractory on the 
wall of DeNOx section can occur, as shown in Fig.2. This 
phenomenon can cause serious damage to the boiler and may 
result from shear stress (friction) of the fluid and thermal 
stress due to the local high temperature（hot spot）. In this 
study, we attempt to alleviate the wall shear stress and 
temperature by refractory thickening and insertion of an 
ellipsoidal cone, as discussed below. 
In this study, a numerical model of the CO boiler is 
constructed by unstructured grid. Five cell densities are tested 
to ensure grid independence solution. They include 49,658 
cells, 73,857 cells, 198,546 cells, 349,411 cells, and 545,753 
cells. Computational results show that the recirculation zone 
sizes of the DeNOx section and the cross-sectional average 
temperature profiles obtained by the last two meshes nearly 
coincide with deviations within 0.5%. Therefore, the mesh of 
349,411 cells is adopted for subsequent discussion.

DeNOx section of a CO boiler. S2 is the distance between the 
starting point of the flue gas cooler section and the central axis

Figure 3.  Illustration of the refractory thickening for the DeNOx section of a 
CO boiler 
 
From the velocity vector profiles on the symmetric plane 
(z=0)(not shown here), it can be seen that refractory thickening 
has very little influence on the flow field in the oxidizer and 
DeSOx sections. This is because the refractory is thickened at 
the DeNOx section and therefore only the DeNOx section and 
the flue gas cooler section（ downstream of the DeNOx 
section）are influenced more. 
Figure 4 compares cross-sectional average skin friction 
coefficients for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with 
refractory thickening. As mentioned above, because refractory 
thickening has very little influence on the flow field in the 
oxidizer and DeSOx sections and only the DeNOx section and 
flue gas cooler section are influenced more, Fig.4 compares 
cross-sectional average skin friction coefficients only in the 
DeNOx and flue gas cooler sections（x=8.7m~24.2m）. It can 
be seen that in the constant-area section (x=8.7m~10.96m), the 
skin friction coefficients for the original CO boiler and the CO 
boiler with refractory thickening nearly coincide. This also 
shows that refractory thickening has very little influence on the 
flow field in the oxidizer section. On the other hand, because 
the DeNOx section (x≧10.96m) is divergent (adverse pressure 
gradient）, the fluid decelerates and a recirculation zone forms. 
The thicker the refractory is, the smaller the adverse pressure 
gradient would be. Therefore, when the refractory is thickened, 
the skin friction coefficient arises later in the flow direction due 
to the lower adverse pressure gradient. In contrast, when the 
refractory is thinner, the skin friction coefficient arises earlier 
in the flow direction due to the larger adverse pressure gradient. 
In the neighborhood of the cooling pipes (x=24.2m), the skin 
friction coefficient arises abruptly due to the increase of solid 
surface area.

Figure 4.  Comparison of cross-sectional average skin friction coefficients for 
original CO boiler and CO boiler with refractory thickening 
 
Figure 5 shows the temperature profiles on the symmetric 
plane (z=0) plane for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler 
with refractory thickening. It can be seen that high temperature 
regions are concentrated in those regions where convective 
motion is weak, e.g. upper portion of the oxidizer section, 
DeNOx section, upstream region of the flue gas cooler section, 
and DeSOx section. These regions are all characterized by 
recirculation. Similar to Fig.13, refractory thickening has minor 
influence on the temperature profile in the oxidizer and DeSOx

and therefore only the DeNOx section and the flue gas cooler 
section（downstream of the DeNOx section）are influenced 
more. The oxidizer section is upstream of the ellipsoidal cone 
and the DeSOx section is far from the ellipsoidal cone and 
therefore the ellipsoidal cone has little influence on the flow 
field in the oxidizer and DeSOx sections.  
In fluid mechanics, an ellipsoidal cone is a blunt body that 
forms a low-pressure wake flow region downstream. The 
wake flow is a region. The larger the ellipsoidal cone angle is, 
the larger the wake flow region would be. Figure 18 shows 
that the ellipsoidal cone interferes with the recirculation zone 
in the DeNOx section of the original CO boiler. This is 
because the flow passage in the DeNOx section becomes 
narrower due to the ellipsoidal cone and this leads to a 
stronger convective motion, which alleviates the recirculation 
strength in the DeNOx section.  
Figure 8 compares cross-sectional average skin friction 
coefficients for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with 
an ellipsoidal cone. As mentioned above, insertion of an 
ellipsoidal cone has little influence on the flow field in the 
oxidizer and DeSOx sections and only the DeNOx section and 
flue gas cooler section are influenced more, Fig.8 compares 
cross-sectional average skin friction coefficients only in the 
DeNOx and flue gas cooler sections（x=8.7m~24.2m）. It 
can be seen that in the constant-area section (x=8.7m~10.96m), 
the skin friction coefficient for the CO boiler with an 
ellipsoidal cone is smaller, which is different from the case of 
refractory thickening in which the skin friction coefficients for 
the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory 
thickening nearly coincide. This is because the fluid motion is 
slowed down by the ellipsoidal cone (from computational 
results, the average velocity is decreased by about 0.5% in the 
existence of an ellipsoidal cone). On the other hand, in the 
DeNOx section (x 10.96m), the solid surface area increases ≧
due to the ellipsoidal cone. The larger the ellipsoidal cone 
angle is, the larger the solid surface area and therefore the 
larger the skin friction coefficient would be. In addition, the 
skin friction coefficient increases abruptly close to the support 
(x=18.09m) because of the increased solid surface area due to 
the support. The larger the ellipsoidal cone angle is, the 
shorter the support would be. Therefore, for a larger 
ellipsoidal cone angle, the increase in the solid surface area 
due to the existence of the support would be smaller, and 
hence the increase in the skin friction coefficient would be less 
severe. Furthermore, the flow passage in the DeNOx section 
becomes narrower due to the ellipsoidal cone and this leads to 
a stronger convective motion, which alleviates the adverse 
pressure gradient and the recirculation strength. Therefore, 
after leaving the DeNOx section and entering the flue gas 
cooler section (19.09m x 24.2m), the skin friction ≦ ≦
coefficient decreases. The larger the ellipsoidal cone angle is, 
the smaller the adverse pressure gradient would be, and hence 
the faster the skin friction coefficient drops. On the other hand, 
because the adverse pressure gradient in the DeNOx section 
for the original CO boiler is larger, the skin friction coefficient 
arises earlier in the flow direction due to the larger adverse 
pressure gradient. In the neighborhood of the cooling pipes 
(x=24.2m), the skin friction coefficient arises abruptly due to 
the increased solid surface area. However, because the 
ellipsoidal cone can alleviate the adverse pressure gradient and 
the recirculation strength, the increase of skin friction 
coefficient in the neighborhood of the cooling pipes is less 
severe for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone.

Figure 8.  Comparison of cross-sectional average skin friction coefficient for 
original CO boiler and CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone 
 
From the temperature profiles on the symmetric plane (z=0) 
and lateral (z=1.44m) planes for the original CO boiler and the 
CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone (not shown here), it can be 
seen that, as for the case of refractory thickening, high 
temperature regions are concentrated where convective motion 
is weak, e.g. upper portion of the oxidizer section, DeNOx 
section, upstream region of the flue gas cooler section, and 
DeSOx section. These regions are characterized by 
recirculation zones. The ellipsoidal cone has only minor 
influence on the temperature profile in the oxidizer and DeSOx 
sections. Only the DeNOx section and the flue gas cooler 
section are influenced more.  
Figure 9 compares the cross-sectional average temperature 
for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with an

influence on the flow field in the oxidizer and DeSOx sections, 
Fig.9 compares cross-sectional average temperature only in 
the DeNOx and flue gas cooler sections（x=8.7m~24.2m）. It 
can be seen that in the constant-area section (x=8.7m~10.96m), 
in contrast to the case of refractory thickening, the temperature 
for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone is lower because the 
ellipsoidal cone can alleviate the recirculation strength. On the 
other hand, because the DeNOx section (x 10.96m) is in the ≧
recirculation zone (adverse pressure gradient) where 
convective motion is weak, the heat dissipation is poor and

作者在先前的研究中[11]曾探討增厚防火泥
對於一氧化碳鍋爐熱傳流場之影響，由研究結果
發現，增厚防火泥對於壁面溫度與剪應變有重大
影響，當防火泥增厚時，脫硝段之逆壓力梯度變

Numerical Study of the Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow in a 
CO Boiler : Influence of Insulation Thickening 
Chun-Lang Yeh 
Professor, Department of Aeronautical Engineering,National Formosa University 
Abstract 
CO boiler plays an important role in the petroleum-refining process. It can retrieve the thermal energy of 
CO from the regenerator for use. CO boiler utilizes the burning gas (CO) from the regenerator as fuel. Then CO 
reacts to form CO2 and release large amount of heat. The hot flue gas then flows through the superheater section 
and exchanges heat with the water in the pipelines to produce superheated steam which can be used by other 
equipments. The daily required amount of steam for a petroleum refinery is extremely huge. The current value of 
steam is 769＄NT per ton. A CO boiler can produce 300 ton of steam per hour. This contributes two billion＄NT 
per year to a petroleum refinery. A CO boiler is composed of oxidizer section, DeNOx section, flue gas cooling 
section, and DeSOx section. The operating temperatures in oxidizer and DeNOx sections can be as high as 
1200 . This can result in the interior or exterior problems of CO boilers. The loss caused by ℃
shutdown/inspection/maintenance of CO boilers can be hundreds of million＄NT per day. Furthermore, the 
potential threats of safety and environmental protection can not be ignored. Consequently, the performance of 
oxidizer and DeNOx sections has a detrimental influence on the operation and production of related industries. 
This paper presents a numerical study of the influence of insulation thickening on the heat transfer and fluid flow 
in a CO boiler. This can be helpful for the subsequent study of the oxidation and DeNOx processes in a CO 
boiler.

ANALYSIS OF THE INSTABILITY FOR TWO NANO-SCALE LIQUID THREADS 
COEXISTING IN A PERIODIC FUNDAMENTAL CELL

ABSTRACT 
  This paper investigates the vaporization process of two 
nano-scale liquid threads coexisting in a periodic fundamental 
cell by molecular dynamics（MD）simulation. The influences 
of liquid thread radius, fundamental cell length, and relative 
position of the two threads are discussed. Snapshots of 
molecules, the number of liquid particles formed, and density 
field are analyzed. Two linear stability criteria, namely, 
Rayleigh’s stability criterion and Kim’s stability criterion, are 
accessed for their validity in molecular scale. It is found that 
the two liquid threads may remain intact or evolve into only 
one liquid particle if the fundamental cell length is small. If the 
threads break up in this case, they rupture from their ends only, 
i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of the fundamental cell, but not 
from their interiors. On the other hand, if the fundamental cell 
length is larger, more than one liquid particle may be produced 
in the cell and the liquid threads rupture not only from their 
ends but also from their interiors. It is also found that thinner 
liquid threads may produce more liquid particles in the cell and 
evaporate more quickly. In addition, more liquid particles are 
formed when the separation of the two threads is larger. 
Moreover, vaporization is slower when the two liquid threads 
are close to each other. On the basis of identical liquid thread 
radius and length, liquid threads that produce more liquid 
particles evaporate more quickly. Finally, the trends of 
Rayleigh’s stability criterion and Kim’s stability criterion agree 
with MD simulation results. However, when the two threads 
coalesce into a single thread and remain intact, the critical 
wavelength of perturbation may be increased and the stable 
domain is broadened. Under such a situation, Rayleigh’s 
stability criterion and Kim’s stability criterion underpredict the 
stable domain.

INTRODUCTION 
Previous studies of nano-scale liquid threads have mostly 
been devoted to the investigation of a single liquid thread in a 
periodic fundamental cell. Lord Rayleigh[1] analyzed the 
instability of an inviscid liquid cylinder and a viscous one. 
Later on, Weber[2] and Tomotika[3] considered more realistic 
cases of liquid threads in unbounded domains. Goren[4] 
studied the annular thread of fluid in contact with a solid. He 
used linear stability analysis to determine the fastest growing 
mode when either inertia or viscous forces are negligible. 
Koplik and Banavar[5] studied the Rayleigh’s instability of a 
cylindrical liquid thread in a vacuum by using a three-
dimensional molecular dynamics simulation. The maximum 
number of molecules they used consisted of 8,192 liquid argon 
Lennard-Jones molecules for a cylindrical liquid thread with a 
non-dimensionalized radius of 7.5 in a box with a non-
dimensionalized length of 54.7. For this simulation condition, 
only one liquid particle was formed. When a smaller 
computational domain was used instead, no liquid particle was 
                                                                                    Copyright © 2011 by ASME 3
 
 
    In this study, two cylindrical liquid threads of length L* 
and radius R* are placed in the computational domain and the 
remaining space is a vacuum. The relative position of the two 
threads is controlled by L1*, L2* and L4*, as shown in Fig.1. 
L3* is set to be zero, i.e., the two liquid threads are kept at x=0 
initially and are shifted only in the y direction. The initial 
density of the liquid argon is ρL*=0.819 and the system 
temperature is kept at T*=0.75. These dimensionless values 
correspond to ρL=1223 kg/m3 for argon and T=70K, which is 
below the critical temperature（150K）of argon.  
The procedure for MD simulation includes three stages : 
initialization, equilibration and production. Initially, 
equilibration is performed for liquid argon molecules in a 
rectangular parallelepiped with length and width equal to the 
liquid thread diameter (D*=2R*=4 or 8) and with height equal 
to the side length of the computational domain (L*=30, 60, 
120, 240, 480). The initial velocities of molecules are decided 
by normal random numbers. Velocity rescaling is performed at 
each time step by Eq.(2) to make sure that the molecules are at 
the desired temperature T* : 
A
Dold
i
new
i T
Tvv                  (2) 
where viold and vinew are the velocities of molecule i before and 
after correction, respectively, and TD and TA are the desired and 
the actual molecular temperatures, respectively. The liquid 
molecules are equilibrated for 106 time steps at the desired 
temperature T*. The achievement of an equilibrium state is 
confirmed by obtaining the radial distribution function. After 
the liquid molecules are equilibrated, the rectangular 
parallelepiped for the liquid molecules is truncated to the 
desired cylindrical liquid thread by removing unwanted 
regions. The cylindrical liquid threads are then put into the 
computational domain and the production stage proceeds. A 
minimum image method and the Verlet neighbor list scheme[9] 
to keep track of which molecules are actually interacting at a 
given time interval of 0.005 are used in the equilibration and 
the production stages. 
In practical applications, e.g., combustors or printers, faster 
vaporization is usually desirable. Criteria have to be made to 
quantify the discussion regarding the vaporization process of a 
liquid thread. In this study, a liquid thread is considered to 
vaporize faster if the distribution of molecules reaches uniform 
state more quickly during the vaporization process. This 
criterion essentially is concerned with the evolution of the 
density distribution. The density at a specified point in the 
fundamental cell can be defined as  
V
N
V 
  0lim                  (3) 
where δV is a small volume surrounding the point considered 
and δN is the number of molecules inside the volume δV. The 
density defined by Eq.(3) is actually an averaged density of the 
small volume surrounding the point considered. The value will 
approach the density of a specified point if the volume δV 
shrinks to that point. However, for a meaningful density field, 
the volume δV cannot be too small because when δV becomes 
too small, it is difficult to obtain a definite value for δN/δV. In 
this study, the volume δV is taken to be a sphere with non-
dimensionalized radius R*=2 and with its center located at the 
point considered. This is an optimal choice after numerical 
testing.  
The time averaged density uniformity factor, f , in a time 
interval of t*=0 to 1000, as listed in Table 1, can be used to 
indicate the vaporization speed of the liquid threads. The 
density uniformity factor, fρ , is defined as  

where N is the total number of molecules in the fundamental 
cell, i.e., Nmol in Table 1, ρ* and △V are the density and 
volume of molecule i, respectively, as defined by Eq.(3), and 
ρ*eq is the density value when the molecules are uniformly 
distributed, i.e. ρ*eq≡Nmol / Vol, where Vol is the volume of the 
fundamental cell. The density uniformity factor, fρ , as defined 
by Eq.(4), represents the deviation from uniform state. A 
smaller time averaged density uniformity factor, f , implies 
that the distribution of liquid thread molecules reaches uniform 
state more quickly during the vaporization process and 
therefore represents faster vaporization. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
In the following discussion, two cylindrical liquid threads 
of length L* and radius R* are placed in the computational 
domain and the remaining space is a vacuum. The relative 
position of the two threads is controlled by L1*, L2* and L4*, as 
                                                                                    Copyright © 2011 by ASME 5

FIGURE 5.  VAPORIZATION PROCESS OF TWO LIQUID

   Figure 6 shows the vaporization process of two liquid 
threads of R*=2, L*=60, L1*=30, L2*=15 and L4*=30（case 6 
in Table 1）. Similar to case 3, the two threads rupture from 
their two ends and get shorter due to the contraction motion in 
their axial directions. Two liquid particles are formed and 
prevail during the subsequent vaporization process. For two 
closer liquid threads, e.g., R*=2, L*=60, L1*=10, L2*=25 and 
L4*=30（case 7 in Table 1）, the vaporization process, which 
is shown in Fig.7, is different from case 6. The two threads also 
rupture from their two ends and get shorter due to the 
contraction motion in their axial directions. Two liquid particles 
are formed but they quickly coalesce into a single particle and 
prevail during the subsequent vaporization process. This 
vaporization process is similar to but slightly different from 
that for thicker liquid threads（case 4）. The thinner liquid 
threads（case 7）evolve into two liquid particles and then 
quickly coalesce into a single particle while the thicker liquid 
threads（case 4）quickly coalesce into a single liquid thread 
and then evolve into a single liquid particle. 
From Table 1, it is seen that the value of f  is larger for 
case 7, i.e., vaporization is slower when the two liquid threads 
are close to each other. In addition, Table 1 shows that more 
liquid particles are produced when the separation of the two 
threads is larger（case 6）. Case 8, which was investigated in 
our previous study[10], denotes the situation for a single liquid 
thread of the same radius and length as those in cases 6 and 7. 
From Table 1, it is seen that only one liquid particle is formed 
for case 8 and the vaporization speed for case 8 is slower than 
case 6, for which two liquid particles are formed. This 
corroborates the previous results for thicker liquid threads
（cases 3, 4 and 5）. Furthermore, comparing cases 6~8 for 
thinner liquid threads（R*=2）with cases 3~5 for thicker 
liquid threads（R*=4）, it can be seen that the value of f  
is smaller for thinner liquid threads, which implies that thinner 
liquid threads evaporate more quickly. This also corroborates 
the previous results for shorter liquid threads（cases 1 and 2）.

   Figure 8 shows the vaporization process of two liquid 
threads of R*=4, L*=120, L1*=60, L2*=30 and L4*=60（case 9 
in Table 1）. Similar to case 3 for shorter liquid threads, the 
two threads rupture from their two ends and get shorter due to 
the contraction motion in their axial directions. Two liquid 
particles are formed and prevail during the subsequent 
vaporization process. For two closer liquid threads, e.g., R*=4, 
L*=120, L1*=40, L2*=40 and L4*=60（case 10 in Table 1）, 
the vaporization process, which is shown in Fig.9, is similar to 
case 9. Two liquid particles are formed and prevail during the 
subsequent vaporization process. If the two liquid threads get 
even closer, e.g., R*=4, L*=120, L1*=10, L2*=55 and L4*=60
（case 11 in Table 1）, the vaporization process, which is 
shown in Fig.10, is quite different from cases 9 and 10. Similar 
to case 4 for shorter liquid threads, it is observed that because 
the two threads in case 11 are very close to each other, they 
quickly coalesce into a single thread before they separately 
evolve into liquid particles. The coalesced liquid thread then 
gets shorter due to the contraction motion in its axial direction 
and finally evolves into a single liquid particle. 
Similar to cases 4 and 7, Table 1 shows that the value of 
f  is larger for case 11, i.e., vaporization is slower when the 
two liquid threads are very close to each other. Similarly, it is 
seen that more liquid particles are produced when the 
                                                                                    Copyright © 2011 by ASME 7

   Figure 14 shows the vaporization process of two liquid 
threads of R*=4, L*=240, L1*=120, L2*=60 and L4*=120
（case 17 in Table 1）. Similar to cases 3 and 9 for shorter 
liquid threads, the two threads rupture from their two ends and 
get shorter due to the contraction motion in their axial 
directions. Two liquid particles are formed and prevail during 
the subsequent vaporization process. For two closer liquid 
threads, e.g., R*=4, L*=240, L1*=40, L2*=100 and L4*=120
（case 18 in Table 1）, the vaporization process, which is 
shown in Fig.15, is similar to that in case 17. If the two liquid 
threads get even closer, e.g., R*=4, L*=240, L1*=10, L2*=115 
and L4*=120（case 19 in Table 1）, the vaporization process, 
which is shown in Fig.16, is quite different from those in cases 
17 and 18. Similar to cases 4 and 11 for shorter liquid threads, 
it is seen that because the two threads in case 19 are very close 
to each other, they quickly coalesce into a single thread before 
they separately evolve into liquid particles. The coalesced 
liquid thread then becomes shorter due to the contraction 
motion in its axial direction and finally evolves into a single 
liquid particle. 
From Table 1, it is observed that the value of f  is larger 
for case 19, i.e., vaporization is slower when the two liquid 
threads are very close to each other. Similarly, it can be seen 
that more liquid particles are produced when the separation of 
the two threads is larger（cases 17 and 18）. Case 20, which 
was investigated in our previous study[10], denotes the 
situation for a single liquid thread of the same radius and length 
as those in cases 17~19. From Table 1, it is seen that only one 
liquid particle is formed for case 20 and the vaporization speed 
for case 20 is slower than those in cases 17 and 18, for which 
two liquid particles are formed. This corroborates the previous 
results for shorter liquid threads（cases 3~16）.

From the above discussion, the following observations can 
be made. 
First, if the fundamental cell length is small, the liquid 
threads may remain intact or evolve into only one liquid 
particle in the cell. If the threads break up in this case, they 
rupture from their ends only, i.e. the top and bottom surfaces of 
the fundamental cell, but not from their interiors. On the other 
hand, if the fundamental cell length is larger, more than one 
liquid particle may be produced in the cell and the liquid 
threads may rupture not only from their ends but also from their 
interiors.  
Second, thinner liquid threads may produce more liquid 
particles in the cell and evaporate more quickly. 
Third, more liquid particles are formed when the separation 
of the two threads is larger. Moreover, vaporization is slower 
when the two liquid threads are close to each other. 
Fourth, on the basis of identical liquid thread radius and 
length, liquid threads that produce more liquid particles 
evaporate more quickly. 
Stability Analysis  
In the scope of fluid flow research, instability has received 
a great deal of attention due to its potential influence on flow 
development. Previous instability analyses, e.g., Lord 
Rayleigh[1], Weber[2] and Tomotika[3], have focused mainly 
on large scale flow fields. The applicabilities of these theories 
to micro- or nano-scale flow fields are still uncertain. On the 
other hand, previous instability analyses for nano-scale liquid 
threads, e.g., Koplik and Banavar[5], Kawano[6], Min and 
Wong[7], Kim, Lee, Han and Park[8] and Yeh[10], have been 
devoted to the investigation of a single liquid thread in a 
periodic fundamental cell. Because of the interaction between 
the two nano-scale liquid threads coexisting in a periodic 
fundamental cell, the vaporization process is quite different 
from that of a single liquid thread. In the following discussion, 
two linear stability criteria, namely Rayleigh’s stability 
criterion[1] and Kim’s stability criterion[8], are accessed for 
their validity in molecular scale. This is the first study to 
investigate the instability of two nano-scale liquid threads 
coexisting in a periodic fundamental cell by MD simulation. 
   According to classical theory by Rayleigh[1], the radius of 
a liquid thread, R, is related to the critical wavelength of 
perturbation, λc , as 
λc=2πR                    (5) 
A liquid thread will break up into drops if the axial wavelength 
of the surface perturbation L＞λc. If L＜λc, the thread is stable 
and will remain intact. Owing to the periodic boundary 
conditions in this study, the fundamental cell size L* can be 
regarded as the longest wavelength of the perturbation.  
   For R*=2, λc* is 12.6. According to Rayleigh’s stability 
criterion, liquid threads of radius R*=2 and length L*=30, 60 
and 120 are expected to be unstable and will break up into 
drop(s). From Figs.3, 6, 7, 11, 13 or Table 1（cases 2, 6~8, 
13~16）, Rayleigh’s stability criterion holds for these cases.  
For R*=4, λc* is 25.2. According to Rayleigh’s stability 
criterion, liquid threads of radius R*=4 and length L*=30, 60, 
120, 240 and 480 are expected to be unstable and will break up 
into drop(s). However, from Figs.2, 4, 5, 8~10,14~19 or Table 
1（cases 1, 3~5, 9~12, 17~24）, the liquid threads of R*=4 
and L*=30（case 1）remain intact while the remaining liquid 
threads are unstable and break up into drop(s). Rayleigh’s 
stability criterion violates the MD simulation result for case 1 
but holds for the remaining cases. The invalidity of Rayleigh’s 
stability criterion for case 1 can be interpreted according to the 
vaporization process shown in Fig.2. It is seen that the two 
liquid threads quickly coalesce into a single thread and remain 
intact. This is somewhat like combining the two threads to form 
a thread of a larger radius, which can increase the critical 
wavelength of perturbation, λc, according to Eq.(5) and, 
therefore, broaden the stable domain. 
Recently, Kim, Lee, Han and Park[8] proposed a new linear 
relation from their MD simulation results. From their study, 
Rayleigh’s linear relation can be modified as 
λc=2.44π(R-1.23)                (6) 
   From Eq.(6), λc* for R* of 2 and 4 are 5.9 and 21.2, 
respectively. Then, from Table 1, it is seen that Kim’s stability 
criterion violates the MD simulation result for case 1 while it 
holds for the remaining cases. The validity of Kim’s stability 
criterion is similar to that of Rayleigh’s stability criterion. 
From the above discussion, it is found that the trends of 
Rayleigh’s stability criterion and Kim’s stability criterion agree 
with MD simulation results. However, when the two liquid 
threads coalesce into a single thread and remain intact, the 
critical wavelength of perturbation may be increased and the 
stable domain is broadened. In such a situation, Rayleigh’s
