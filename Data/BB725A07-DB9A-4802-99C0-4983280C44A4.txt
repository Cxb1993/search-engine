台灣的自然環境山脈地質多屬於沈積岩及變質岩，其性質脆弱而易斷裂。在民國
88 年九二一集集大地震之後，由於地震造成山坡地質破碎，土壤鬆動，以致於這幾年在
夏季豪雨集中的颱風季節山區土石流發生的次數及規模明顯增加，不僅對居民生命、房
屋、土地財產帶來威脅，更對山區橋樑、道路等公共建設造成的巨大損害。本計劃預計參

（質量、動量守恆）建立於通用座標系統（Unified Coordinate）上。由於在通用座標系統
中，座標網格線隨著假想流動質點速度移動，網格自動產生，不必透過深度積分以簡化方
程式減少數值模型的困難度，得以完成真正二維及三維的理論模型，再搭配 shock-
capturing technique（e.g. Godunov/MUSCL）結合成一理論數值模型，同時解決震波與自由

1貳、報告內容
(一)前言及研究目的
Avalanches, landslides, rock falls and debris flows are rapid gravitational mass movements.
They are extremely destructive natural phenomena and responsible for prompt reshaping of new
topography after each event. Examples are the landslides triggered by the earthquake on the 21st,
September, 1999, in Taiwan, e.g., Chang et al. (2005) and Chen et al. (2006). The erosion process
taking place in the subsequent years after the earthquake is also proven a substantial factor for the
significant change of the local topography.
The geology, topography and meteorological conditions in Taiwan provide the essential
factors for inducing debris flows. Since the lithology in the mountainous regions has been broken
during the 921 Chi-Chi Earthquake in 1999, the size and number of hazards have considerably
increased in these years, leading to large casualties, not only the injury or loss of life of the
inhabitants but also of the tourists, and serious damage of infra-structures. Thus, it is of utmost
interest to have an appropriate model to describe the destructive flows, not only for the laboratory
experiment, but suitable for the general topography in nature.
A fundamental issue for describing gravity driven flows over general topography is the
search for an “optimal”coordinate. Bouchut and Westdickenberg (2004) proposed an arbitrary
coordinate system for general topography (BW). The unified coordinate system (UC) (e.g., Hui
2004, 2007), which was developed for computational fluid dynamics, combines the advantages of
both Eulerian and Lagrangian systems, so that the coordinates can instantaneously move with
some singular surface within the flows. By utilizing the benefit of the BW coordinates and UC
system, a new model of gravity driven flows over general topography is derived, in which the
erosion and deposition processes at the bed are considered. The depth-integrated mass and
momentum equations are presented in the time-dependent and terrain-following coordinate
system, which coincides with the interface distinguishing between the static and flowing layers. A
shock-capturing numerical scheme is implemented to solve the derived equation system.
Simulation results present the new features of this model and reveal a new physical insight of the
erosion/deposition processes.
3an extra degree of freedom to specify how it moves. It is, therefore, straightforward to define our
terrain-following coordinates to move in accordance with the erodible surface. Scaling analysis
can also be accurately carried out for implementing the shallowness assumptions.
An additional condition for the extra degree of freedom of the moving coordinates, the
erosion model, is still needed to close the equation system. We modify the model proposed by
Bouchaud et al. (1994), that the erosion rate is linearly proportional to the thickness of the
flowing layer and the sine value of the difference of the topographic inclination angle and the
angle of repose. In addition, based on experimental observation, a threshold velocity is introduced
for the deposition rate, where the deposition procedure takes place only when the local velocity is
less than the threshold.
The derived equation system in the terrain-following coordinates nicely retains the
properties of the hyperbolic system. Traditional algorithms developed in Eulerian coordinates can
be applied to the new model without difficulty. We implement the Godunov/MUSCL, Leapage
and Hui (1995), for a shock-capturing and Riemann-solver-free non-oscillating central (NOC)
scheme, e.g., Nessyahu and Tadmor (1990), Jiang and Tadmore (1997) and Tai et al. (2002), for
numerical simulation purposes. This model is tested numerically by the motion of granular
avalanches down an inclined plane chute into the horizontal run-out zone, where the deposition
process is carefully investigated with different parameters. Taking the benefit of terrain-following
coordinates and the deposition procedure, the open problem of free moving boundaries for the
run-out distance is solved and the effect of the angle of repose by deposit is also described.

Establishing the coordinates, we can decompose any point within the flowing layer above
the topographic surface as

3.5 Erosion/deposition rate
To close the equation system for an erodible model, the erosion/deposition process should be
taken into account which is crucial for this model. Erosion/deposition has been recognized as an
important process in many types of gravity flows, but detailed experimental information on the
mechanism is scarce. However, many researchers have taken efforts to describe it. For granular
flows, Bouchaud et al. (1994) first described the erosion and deposition processes using the
concept of a continuum, but only mass balance was considered. Based on the classic paper of
Bouchaud et al. (1994), Boutreux et al. (1998) extended it into a model for thick granular
avalanches, where the deposition rate is assumed to be independent of the thickness, but
dependent on some constant upv , comparable to the flow velocity. Pitman \ et al. (2003), taking
also the momentum balance into account, modeled an erosive-only bed when the shearing stress
is higher than a threshold, where the erosion rate is assumed to be linearly proportional to the
local flow velocity. Naaim et al. (2003) applied Pouliquen's nonlinear constitutive law (1999)
for the friction force, where the empirical critical angles min , max and the corresponding
threshold depth stoph are taken into account, and the erosion/deposition rate is determined
from the balance of the force at the base.
Fig. 3.3 Snapshots of dry colored Ottawa sand flowing down an inclined chute and deposited in
horizontal run-out zone, where the inclination angle is equal to the angle of repose of the sand (35) and
the time difference is 0.2 sec. The friction angle between the sliding surface and sand is about 24.
Deposition does certainly not take place for n in the transition zone, where the inclination angle
decreases from 35to 0.
Here, based on Bouchaud et al. (1994) we propose a modified equation for the evolution of the

Thus, deposition takes place once the inclination angle is less than the angle of repose when the
velocity is less than the threshold velocity, and erosion occurs when the inclination angle is larger
than the angle of repose. Once E and the densities of  and  are given, the value of M in
the kinematic boundary condition (37) can be determined by (38). It should be noted that in the
spirit of the UC method any reasonable coordinate velocity can be applied for this model, e.g., the
erosive law proposed by Naaim et al. (2003) or Pitman et al. (2003). This demonstrates the
advantage of the flexibility of this model.
3.6 Depth integration
For the granular flows considered in this paper, the depth is assumed to be much smaller than its
longitudinal characteristic length, and the physical quantities do not exhibit large deviations along
the depth. Therefore, depth integration and appropriate dimensional analysis can be employed to
recognize the physically significant terms in the equations. For clarity, the depth integrated terms
are introduced here at first, and the dimensional analysis and further simplification are deferred
later.

3.8 New features of the model equations
Equations (65)—(66) constitute a one-dimensional system of equations which entails several
advantages over previous model equations of the Savage-Hutter (1989) type for dry granular
materials. They are as follows:
 The equations systematically include the curvature of the basal topography, which changes
with time. They are written in a curvilinear coordinate system. Therefore, they can describe
granular flows along a non-uniformly curved bed of general type simultaneously.
 For 0M , which implies Ω is independent of time, the equation system of (65) and (66)
reduces to the ones in Savage and Hutter (1989) (without curvature) or Hutter et al. (1993),
Greve and Hutter (1993) (with curvature) if the velocity is rewritten in the 

-coordinates,
q .
 The physical quantity 0uh computed in (66), is expressed in the Cartesian coordinates. That
avoids the complicated calculation of Christoffel symbols and computations of changing
coordinate orientation.
 For the application of numerical simulations, the equations are written in terrain-following
coordinates that the meshes are automatically generated to fit the moving topography.
 These equations are in conservation form and of hyperbolic type. Any modern shock- captur-
ing technique can be implemented into this system for describing shock formations as
observed in experiments, e.g., Rericha et al. (2002) or Gray et al. (2003).
3.9 Model tests

Fig. 3.4 illustrates the simulated process as the granular mass slides on the inclined plane
into the horizontal run-out zone. The avalanche body remains a parabolic form on the inclined
plane, e.g., see the figure marked by 01.50tt . Once the front reaches the horizontal run-out
zone the basal friction brings the front part of the granular material to rest, but the part of the rear
accelerates further. At this stage, with the parameters set in (73), deposition takes place
( 01.170tt ),where the black dashed line represents the actual basal surface. With time it

The evolution of the moving basal surface and the corresponding flow surface are shown in
Fig. 3.5, where the actual basal surfaces are represented by the black dashed lines. Shortly after
01.150tt , deposition begins to take place at the front part, where the local velocity is less
than the threshold velocity thv . The basal surface moves fast upwards and upstream (from
01.170tt to 01.190tt ). Because the rear part of the moving mass accelerates further a
surface flow is established above the newly generated bed ( 01.190tt to 02.230tt ). The
depth of this surface flow decreases until 91.240tt . At this stage the total volume of flowing
layer is less than 210 ( %12.0 of the initial volume) and recognized to be at rest. At this stage,
one may imagine that the whole avalanche is frozen through this deposition process and the
problem of the free moving boundary on traditional fixed Eulerian meshes is therefore solved.
The final depth profile is kept at 91.240tt in stationary state.

伍、計畫成果自評
本研究計畫原規劃為多年期進行，今年先行執行一年，雖然大部分工作均仍在進行
中，已獲至初步成果；將區分為理論模型以及數值模型兩個部份來討論：
第一部份：理論模型
本研究計畫採用 Bouchut & Westdickenberg [2004] 所提出的任意地形上的淺水模型
（Shallow Water Models for Arbitrary Topography）概念，結合 Hui（2004, 2007）的通用座
標系統（Unified Coordinate），透過扁平化假設（shallowness assumption）以及（scaling
analyses），在應力部份引入莫爾庫侖準則（Mohr-Coulomb criteria）描述流體內部顆粒間
的應力行為，建立一新的任意地形上的顆粒流模型。此模型的特色在於透過通用座標特
性，雖然座標隨著時間變動，各物理量均由固定於空間中的卡氏座標（Cartesian
Coordinates）的方向來表示，如此可有效避免繁雜的 Christoffel Symbols 的計算；此外，
由於整個方程式系統可維持為保守形式（conservative form），更簡化了數值模型的複雜
性。
在本模型的建構過程中，最為挑戰的部份在於侵蝕 /沈積速率（erosion/deposition
rate）的設定，透過高速攝影機於流槽實驗的觀測（see Fig. 3.3 for reference），我們發現侵
蝕與沈積並不是一單純的反作用，而應有一截然不同之機制。為維持模型整體的簡潔性我
們在考慮沈積時引入一臨界速度（Threshold velocity），只有當流體速度小於該臨界速度時
才會發生沈積的行為。
第二部份：數值模型
由於整個方程式系統為保守形式，許多已經發展成熟針對氣體動力學（ gas
dynamics）的數值模型均可採用。在本研究中我們採用 Nessyahu and Tadmor (1990), Jiang
and Tadmore (1997) and Tai et al.（2002）所提出來的 NOC 方法（shock-capturing and
Riemann-solver-free non-oscillating central scheme）來檢測新提出之理論模型。模擬一假設
條件，顆粒體自斜坡面上滑動至一水平堆積區，其堆積發生時底床將隨著堆積過程上升，
相較於以往傳統的理論模型，本模型所描述的現象與自然界觀察到的的現象相當吻合
（see Fig. 3.4 and 3.5），然而仍然有待進一步的實驗量測數據。
透過本研究所提出之新理論模型可更進一步探究顆粒體堆積的整個過程，對於顆粒體
兩相（液相以及固相）間的轉換提供了一有力的工具。此外，採用高速攝影機進行的流槽
實驗與理論值的比對則尚在進行中。

奧地利維也納所舉辦之 2007年會，包括第一天的報到日，會議共為期六天（April
15 ~ 20, 2007）。該協會為歐洲地球科學領域規模與影響力最大之學會，研討會
議題包含地球科學、環境與自然災害等議題，本次會議一共區分為二十六個主
要議題（Sessions），分別於十多個演講廳同時進行。在本會期中報告人有興趣
之議題分別屬於”Geomorphology”、”Hydrological Sciences”、”Natural Hazards”
以及”Soil System Sciences”，因此會議期間必須穿梭於各演講廳。此外，會議期
間自 April 16至 April 20, 2007每日均於展覽場地做 Poster展出，因此報告人亦
需於各演講報告的空檔參觀各 Poster成果的展出，並與相關與會學者相互討論。
本次會議報告人投稿以 Poster 形式報告之文章標題為”A new model of
gravity driven flows over general topography with erosion”，其要旨為結合 Bouchut
and Westdickenberg （2004）所提出之現地座標系統（general topography coordi-
nate）以及 Grafton W.H. Hui（2004）所提出之通用座標系統（Unified Coordinate）
