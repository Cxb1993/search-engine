2Introduction
By cooperating the using of magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic-nanoparticles can be used to label the
stem cell or cancer cell for medical treatment [1]. To improve the entering efficiency and safety for the cell,
interactions and compatibility between the cell and nanoparticle are important research field [2]. The optical
trapping is one of useful tool with the ability to manipulate the nanoparticle and cell for the study of their
interaction. Of this one year project, we demonstrate an optical manipulation system for the several
transparent particles and high absorptive magnetic ferric-oxide nanoparticle. The test transparent particles are
silica particle with 1.2μm. And magnetic ferric-oxide nanoparticle has 20nm diameter approximately, which
composed by Yang’s Lab in our campus [3]. The transparent micro-particle can be trapped in the focus area
of Gaussian distribution by the optical tweezers system [4]. However, of this system the absorption metal
micro-particle was drag into the focus area then push away by the optical force. Some methods were introduce
for the metal micro-particle trapping [5-6]. Firstly, we demonstrate the multi-particle manipulation by
holography tweezers. We applied interactive Fourier transform algorithm(IFTA)[7] to calculate the
phase-only computer generated hologram(CGH) which display be the spatial light modulator(SLM). The
multi-points, on the focus plane of high-numerical aperture of the optical tweezers system, were developed
and with ability to trap then manipulate several particles simultaneously. Moreover, we also apply CGH with
spatial light modulator(SLM) to implement the optical vortex [錯誤! 找不到參照來源。-8] around the focus
area and then manipulate the metal nanoparticle cluster. The transmission type and reflection type liquid
crystal display(LCD) were used to be the SLM of this project.
Of all renewable energies, biodiesel production from oleaginous microorganisms is considered as a
promising alternative. In this regard, the subject of this study aims at novel fungi that were recently isolated
from hot spring or coast in Taiwan [10-15]. It has been found that the most appropriate temperatures for the
growth and oil production for these microorganisms are in the range of 20 ~℃ 30℃, and that they can survive
up to 60℃ in natural environments. To date, 56 isolates including oil-producing microorganisms and algae are
found. The microbial isolates are rich in oil accounting for approximately 50% of dry cell weight. From the
gas chromatography mass analysis it indicates that the produced oils comprises of saturated and unsaturated
fatty acid alike.
Raman spectroscopy [16] has been proved to be a powerful method to probe the biochemical
composition of microorganisms. Without preprocessing, solids, powders or liquid samples consisting of
complex mixtures can be studied by Raman scattering. On the other hand, optical tweezers [17] is capable of
manipulating micrometer-sized particles by a highly focused laser beam. It allows the spectroscopic study of a
single motile microbial particle immersed in fluid. Optical tweezers Raman spectroscopy system (OTRS) [16],
also called Raman tweezers, integrates an optical trapping into a standard Raman system. It enables us to
perform Raman measurements of optically-immobilized single microorganisms under animate conditions.
Thus, individual characteristics instead of the ensemble average of the sample can be unambiguously
measured. In this study, we demonstrated a Raman tweezers and its application to the study of a single cell of
living microorganisms TN01, BL15, and CH24-3. To reveal the vibrational structures of these
microorganisms in terms of their constituents, Raman spectra of pristineβ-carotene, saturated and unsaturated
fatty acids are also presented. As references to those of the microorganisms under study our results of fatty
acids were compared with that of stearic acid (saturated fatty acid) and oleic acid (unsaturated fatty acid)
For the metal particle manipulation, the optical vortex were introducing into the optical
tweezers system. The wave function r of the helical mode is expressed as a phase factor
proportional to the polar angle  around the beam’s axis,

is the wave vector of beam, ( , )u r z is the radial profile of light wave amplitude
at position z, andis an integral winding number. Within this optical field of helical mode,
the photon will carry an orbital angular momentum . Therefore, the beam can exert a
torque proportional to its intensity on the trapping particle. When this beam is Fourier
transformed onto the focus plane, the constructive interference yield at a bright ring of radius
R from the optical axis. The radius of the principal maximum of the ring is approximated as

Of this study, the liquid crystal spatial light modulator(LC SLM) was used to create the
phase distribution of vortex(Eq. 1). The constructed wavefront of the optical vortex travel and
surround along the optical axis around the focus area. With different winding number, the
ring of different radius was constructed. By projecting into the focus plane of objective in
optical tweezers, the metal nanoparticle cluster manipulation was implemented. The
experimental results show the magnetic ferric-oxide nanoparticle was trapped and then travel
along the circle.
Figure 4 shows schematically the Raman tweezers. The homemade optical tweezers
comprises a high numerical aperture (NA=1.3) and high magnification (100X) water
immersion objective which produces a sharp focus that traps micro-particles suspended in
solutions. An Argon ion laser with wavelength = 514.5 nm was employed for optical
trapping and for Raman excitation as well. The scattered light was collected by the same
objective and recorded by a LN2 cooled CCD detector that is connected to a double grating
spectrometer. In addition, a separated CCD combined with a red LED were used as the
imaging system which monitors the optically trapped particle. Saturated fatty acids and
-carotene were measured in solid state, whereas unsaturated fatty acids were measured in
liquid state and living microorganisms of TN01, BL15, and CH24-3 were measured in culture

Experimental result and discussion
Firstly, the target pattern were input into IFTA to produce the computer generated
hologram(CGH). Then the holograms were encoded as 16 grayscale on the transmission type
LCD. Figure 5 shows the target pattern, CGH, and resulting developed pattern by simulation

ring is 98 pixels on the CCD detection. The intensity distribution along the axis of simulated

To investigate the relation between the diameter and winding number, the winding
number  of 20, 60, and 80 were also applied. The diameter in pixels of the rings in the
optical experimet and computer simulation was list on the Table. 1. The experimental data
was plot in the Fig. 8. The result shows the linearty between the diameter and winding
number, which conincidence with Eq. (2). By fitting the experimental data with Eq. 2, the oR

The fluid sample containing the magnetic ferric-oxide nanoparticle was then placed on the
glass above the objective. Figure 4 and 5 show the time-lapse images of the cluster traveling
around the optical vertex with winding number =20, and 40, respectively. The arrows of
Fig. 9 indicate the location of the trapped clusters. The images show the aggregation of
ferric-oxide nanoparticle, and the diameter of aggregative cluster is around 1μm.Moreover,
Fig. 9 and 10 shows different clarity. Because the different ring intensity with each winding
number let the manipulation plane are located at different height along the beam axis. The
cluster travel around less than 1/3 of circle clockwise within 1.2sec on Fig. 9, whereas less
than 3/4 of circle on Fig. 10. The angular velocity is around 0.28 and 0.6 round/sec,
respectively. This result conform the angular momentum be proportional to the winding
number.

Fig. 11. Raman spectra of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids.
Figure 12 presents the Raman spectra of trapped single cell of living microorganisms TN01, BL15,
and CH24-3 suspended in culture solution. Compared with the Raman spectrum ofβ-carotene the three
prominent peaks associated with the microorganisms at 1005, 1155, and 1515 cm-1 can be identified as,
respectively, the δ(C-CH3), ν(C–C), and ν(C=C) vibration modes of -carotene. Moreover, the peaks
at 1189, 1208, and 1268 cm-1 can be attributed to the C-H in-plane bending mode coupled with C–C and
C=C vibration modes of β-carotene. There are a few weak peaks appeared in the Raman spectra of
TN01, BL15, and CH24-3 which might be associated with the vibration modes of their constituents of
fatty acids. Unfortunately, the relatively low signal to noise ratio of these weak peaks prevents us from a
conclusive identification of their constituents.
