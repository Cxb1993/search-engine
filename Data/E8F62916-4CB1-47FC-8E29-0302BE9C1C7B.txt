of the evolutionary system, which is also the 
root of the original algebraic equations, is then 
obtained by applying numerical integrations on 
the resultant ordinary differential equations, 
which do not require the derivative of nonlinear 
algebraic equations. After the invention of the 
FTIM, it was successfully applied to solve the 
discretized inverse Sturm-Liouville problems, 
m-point boundary value problems and 
problems involving Fredholm integral 
equations by Liu (2008f), Liu (2009), and Liu 
and Atluri (2009), respectively. In all of these 
applications, the problems were first 
discretized into nonlinear algebraic equations 
and then formally solved by the FTIM. 
Furthermore, the FTIM was found to be robust 
against the noise when it is applied to solve 
problems involving the Fredholm integral 
equations. Similarly, Liu (2008b) utilized the 
FTIM to solve some nonlinear obstacle 
problems. With the aid of NCP-functions a set 
of nonlinear algebraic equations are obtained 
and then the FTIM is used to solve these 
nonlinear equations.  
 In addition to nonlinear algebraic 
equations, Liu and Atluri (2008e) introduced 
the application of the FTIM to solve a 
nonlinear optimization problem (NOP) under 
multiple equality and inequality constraints. 
The Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are 
used to transform the NOP into a mixed 
complementary problem.  
The FTIM has also been adopted to tackle 
two-dimensional nonlinear elliptic boundary 
value problems by Liu (2008d). Six examples 
including Laplace, Poisson, reaction diffusion, 
Helmholtz, the minimal surface, and explosion 
equations were tested therein. In order to 
improve the efficiency, Ku, Yeih, Liu and Chi 
(2009) introduced a new time-like function to 
solve nonlinear PDEs. In their solution 
procedure, the spatial finite difference method 
(FDM) was applied to discretize the governing 
equation into a system of nonlinear algebraic 
equations which was then formally solved by 
the FTIM. In this study, we on the other hand 
directly apply the FTIM to convert a nonlinear 
PDE into a sequence of linear 
nonhomogeneous PDEs which are then solved 
by a meshless numerical method. 
 In the last two decades, there has been an 
increasing interest in the idea of meshless or 
mesh-free numerical methods for solving 
partial differential equations (PDEs). Generally 
speaking, such methods can be divided into two 
categories. The first one is domain-type 
methods in which both the differential 
equations and boundary conditions are 
approximated, such as the Kansa’s method (or 
multiquadrics (MQ) method) [Kansa (1990a, 
1990b); Young, Jane, Lin, Chiu and Chen 
(2004); Young, Chen and Wong (2005)] as 
well as the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin 
method (MLPG) [Wordelman, Aluru and 
Ravaioli (2000); Lin and Atluri (2000); Kim 
and Atluri (2000); Atluri (2004); Han and 
Atluri (2004)]. The second one is 
boundary-type methods where only boundary 
conditions are collocated, such as the method 
of fundamental solutions (MFS) [Kupradze and 
Aleksidze (1964); Mathon and Johnston (1977); 
Bogomolny (1985), Smyrlis and Karageorghis 
(2001); Tsai, Young and Cheng (2002); 
Smyrlis and Karageorghis (2004); Chen, Fan, 
Young, Murugesan and Tsai (2005); Hon and 
Wei (2005); Young and Ruan (2005); Tsai, Lin, 
Young, and Atluri (2006); Young, Tsai, Lin 
and Chen (2006)] and the Trefftz method [Liu 
(2007a, 2007b)]. In this paper, we are going to 
use the MFS-CP to solve linear inhomogeneous 
PDEs which are resulted from nonlinear PDEs 
by using the FTIM. 
 The method of particular solution (MPS), 
invented by Golberg and Chen (1999), is 
needed in order to apply the MFS for solving 
nonhomogeneous PDEs since the MFS 
generally requires the governing equation to be 
homogeneous. Actually, the MPS is equivalent 
to the dual reciprocity boundary element 
method (DRBEM) invented by Nardini and 
Brebbia (1982). In the applications of the MPS, 
it is desired to have the analytical particular 
solutions associated to the basis functions and 
the considered partial differential operator. 
When the Chebyshev polynomials are adopted 
as the basis function, analytical particular 
solutions of the modified Helmholtz operator 
can be found in the literatures [Golberg, 
Muleshkov, Chen, and Cheng (2003); Reutskiy 
and Chen (2006); Karageorghis, and Kyza 
(2007); Ding and Chen (2007); Tsai (2008); 
Tsai (2009)]. Overall, the method of

 accuracy of the EVF is investigated to solve the problem of water wave 
scattering over steps. Furthermore, its applicability for wave 
propagating over an arbitrary bottom topography is examined by using 
Roseau's analytical solution (1976). Our results show that the solutions 
converge very well for both mild and steep curved beach profiles. This 
method improves the limitation of the pseudo converges for the TM 
method to solve the problem of wave propagating over a steep bottom.

WAVE MODEL 
We consider the one dimensional problem for a monochromatic wave 
propagating over an arbitrary bottom configuration with time 
dependence te ω−i , where t
 
is the time, ω
 
the angular frequency and i
 the unit of complex number.  T he sea bottom is represented by a 
succession of flat shelves as depicted in Fig. 1. For example,  Roseau's 
curved bottom profile (1976) is approximated by steps as demonstrated 
in Fig. 2. In Fig. 1, there are M  shelves with depth mh  in the interval 
of 1m mx x x− < <  for 1, 2,3,...,m M=  and 1M −  steps at mx x=  for 
1, 2,3,..., 1m M= − . In order to make the formulation easier, it is 
assumed that 
0x = −∞  and Mx = ∞ , respectively.  T he coordinate 
( ),x y  in Fig. 2 is defined that x  is the horizontal direction and y  is 
the vertical direction upwards positively from the still water level on 
0y = . According to Airy's linear wave theory (1845), the velocity 
potential is governed by Laplace equation given by 
2 0φ∇ =                                                         (1)

In Eq. (4), 2K gω=  and g  is the acceleration of gravity. The 
following marching conditions are required at each step

where R  and T  are the reflection and transmission coefficients, 
respectively, and 
mκ  is the wavenumber in the interval of

tanhm m mh Kκ κ =  for 1, 2,3,...,m M=                                 (8) 
 
EXTENDED VARIATIONAL FORMULATION

 To obtain a complete solution in the present model, it is desirable to

To obtain a numerical solution to the prescribed problem, the numbers 
N , L , and J  should be truncated to finite values. In the model, there 
are ( )( )3 1L M+ −  unknowns of ,m lu  and mA  & mB , except that 1A  
and MB  have been defined in Eq. (30). Therefore, J L=  should be set 
to obtain ( )( )3 1L M+ −  equations as given in Eqs. (26)~(29). After 
the coefficients 
mA  and mB  are solved, Eq. (31) can thus be used to 
obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients of the water wave 
problem. If it is required to solve the velocity potential, Eqs. (9), (19), 
and (20) can be implemented to get the solution mφ . These complete 
the procedure of numerical solutions in the EVF.  
It should be noted that we do not  explicitly construct an integral 
equation and use the variational principle since its derivation is more 
difficult for multiple steps. However, the equivalence between the 
present derivation and the variational formulation had been 
demonstrated by (Miles 1967) for the scattering problem over a single 
step. 
 
TRANSFER-MATRIX METHOD 
Eqs. (26)~(29) are readily reduced to the TM method of Miles (1967) 
and Devillard et al. (1988) using the wide-spacing approximation 
(Devillard et al. 1988) subject to 0J L= = , defined as:

In Eq. (32), we assumed that the evanescent eigenfunctions originating 
at one step are negligible when they reach the next step. Based on these

 (42) 
Eq. (42) is the transfer matrix of Devillard et al. (1988) based on the 
variational formulation of Miles (1967). Clearly, the combined effect of 
the series of steps can be achieved by simply applying matrix 
multiplications to the transfer matrices of all the steps. We also notice 
that Eq. (42) can be further reduced to the plane-wave approximation of

RESULTS 
The validity of the present approximation is examined to two case of 
waves propagating over a step, a rectangle obstacle. All the EVF, EMM, 
TM method, and plane-wave approximations are applied to solve the 
prescribed wave scattering problems. In both of the cases, the reflection 
coefficients are tabulated and compared with the results in the 
literatures. If the derived methods were verified well, they are thus 
applied to the problem of water wave scattering over Roseau's curved 
profile. This result demonstrates the applicability of our method for 
solving water wave scattering by a arbitrary bottom topography.

Eq. (43) defines a step of depths from 1 to ε  with ( )0, 2β π∈  being 
the steepness of the step. In the present investigation, three typical 
cases of mild ( 0.1β = ), middle ( 1.0β = ), and steep ( 1.5β = ) slopes 
are all considered. These values are selected according to Evans and 
Linton(1994). The analytical reflection coefficient was derived by 
Roseau (1976) expressed as
