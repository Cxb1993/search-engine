Abstract
Rice bran is a common underutilized milling by-product of brown rice. It is
well-known that rice bran contains amounts of protein, oil, crude fiber, vitamin E,
vitamin B complex and minerals. In addition, rice bran also contains some functional
and bioactive compounds which are beneficial as an antioxidative agent, hypolipidemic
agent and liver protection agent. Moreover, rice bran protein has unique nutritional
values and nutraceutical properties which are suitable as a hypoallergenic protein in
infant food ingredients. However, the application of rice bran protein in the food
industry is still limited due to rapid oxidative rancidity by the formation of free fatty
acids by lipase, amounts of starches that are extensively bound to proteins and make it
very difficult to separate the protein bodies from these components, and difficulty in
protein extraction due to strong aggregation tendency caused by extensive disulfide
bonding.
In this study, microwave stabilization treatment for fresh rice bran from several
initial moisture contents (from moisture content of 7.3% adjusted to 15.0%, 21.0%,
25.0%, and 30.0%) with different period of heating time (0 s to 30 s, 60 s, 90 s, 120 s,
150 s, and 180 s) have been used for extending rice bran shelf-life by lipase inactivation.
Effect of intermittently microwave heating treatment (60 s and 150 s) of rice bran
stabilization on lipase inactivation and acid value of rice bran samples were investigated.
Results showed that lipase activity of rice bran with initial moisture content of 25.0%,
heated for 150 s reduced from 3.49 ± 0.22 U/g to 0.96 ± 0.03 U/g, the lipase inactivation
was about 72.53 ± 0.86%. Intermittently microwave heating of rice bran with initial
moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 s could reduce lipase activity. However, the
color appearances of rice bran sample had changed and rice bran quality was decreased
for further food uses. For acid value level determination, rice bran with initial moisture
content of 25.0%, heated for 150 s could be store at 4°C, 25°C, and 40°C for 12 weeks.
For biotransformation by 0.6% of α-amylase enzymatic treatment at 55°C with pH
6.5 for 30 minutes, starch removal rate were 67.92 ± 0.48%, 68.56 ± 1.84%, and 64.12
± 1.93% for raw rice bran, microwave stabilized rice bran with initial moisture content
of 25.0%, heated for 150 s, and defatted microwave stabilized rice bran with initial
moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 s, respectively. Protein recovery reached
above 90.0%.
For SDS-PAGE patterns of raw rice bran, microwave stabilized rice bran with
initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 s and defatted microwave stabilized
rice bran with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 s with/without
α-amylase enzymatic treatments showed no smeared bands of polypeptides for the
protein. It might prove that α-amylase enzymatic treatments at 55°C with pH 6.5 for 30
minutes did not cause any substantial damage to protein.
1Chapter 1 Introduction
Rice (Oryza sativa L) is one of the most staple diets in Asian countries and rice
bran is one of the major by-products from rice milling process. Rice bran consists of the
outer bran layers of the kernel and part of the germ, and constitutes 8.8% to 15.5% by
weight of brown rice (Juliano, 1972). It is rich in proteins, lipids, dietary fibers,
vitamins, and minerals (Saunders, 1990). Rice bran is usually not consumed directly as
food because of its high fiber content and possible hull contamination (Luh, 1991). In
the food industry, the application of rice bran is restricted due to the rice bran lipase
activation, which upon milling breaks down glycerides into fatty acids (Juliano, 1985).
Development of rice bran stabilization methods has led to use of a small percentage of
rice bran as commercial food products. However, rice bran is either used mostly as an
ingredient in animal feed or as fuel in boilers.
Rice bran protein has been recognized as nutritionally superior to other proteins
due to its hypoallergenicity and anti-cancer activity (Helm and Burks, 1996; Kawamura
and Muramato, 1993; Shoji et al., 2001). Although the potential of application of
nutritional and pharmaceutical value of rice bran protein in food industry has been
recognized but the rice bran protein concentrates and isolates are not yet commercially
produced in bulk. This lack of availability could be due to the complex nature of rice
bran protein which contains 37% albumin, 36% globulin, 22% glutelin, and 5%
prolamin (Betschart et al., 1977), rice bran have poor solubility that is cause by strong
aggregation and/or extensive disulfide bond cross-linking (Hamada, 1995), it also
contains high phytate, fiber, and starch that could bind with proteins, making the protein
bodies very hard to separate from other components (Juliano, 1985).
Nowadays, healthy has become the important topic for human life. The uses of
high nutritional value of waste materials also become the main topic in food industry.
Therefore, there were many studies about increasing rice bran nutritional value by
finding efficient methods for protein extraction, dietary fiber extraction, etc.
In this study, rice bran, as the main material was stabilized by microwave for lipase
inactivation. The suitable condition for microwave stabilization treatment of rice bran
was determined by lipase inactivation (%) and acid value determination on different
storage temperature for 12 weeks. In addition, biotransformation by α-amylase
enzymatic treatment was also used to promote the protein extraction on further
experiments by converting starches into sugars. Rice bran proteins were extracted by
different solvents and examined for their polypeptides bands structures before and after
α-amylase enzymatic treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate and
develop the nutritional value of rice bran proteins by using low-cost and efficient
methods.
3are mainly grown submerged in low lands, throughout tropical Asia.
Japonica and Javanica have low amylose content, extensive alkali-spreading
reaction, and low gelatinization temperature. In contrast, Indica has intermediate
amylose content, slight to moderate alkali-spreading reaction, and intermediate
gelatinization temperature (Jennings et al., 1979). There are several colors of rice,
such as white, brown, black, purple, and red, which can be found in the
commercial market.
3.1.4 Structure and composition of rice
The rice grain consists of an outer protective layer, the hull, and the rice
caryopsis or fruit (brown, cargo, dehulled or dehusked rice). Brown rice is
produced by removing its hull; it consists of the outer layers of pericarp, seed-coat
and nucellus; the germ or embryo; and the endosperm. The endosperm consists of
the aleurone layer and the endosperm proper, consisting of the subaleurone layer
and the starchy or inner endosperm. The aleurone layer encloses the embryo.
Pigment is confined to the pericarp. Rice is composed of starch (53.4%), crude
fiber (7.2% ~ 10.4%), protein (5.8% ~ 7.7%), lipid (1.5% ~ 2.3%) and minerals
(2.9 ~ 5.2%) (Juliano and Bechtel, 1985).
3.2 Introduction of rice bran
3.2.1 Rice bran
Rice milling process begins as soon as the rice paddy arrives from the fields.
Milling involves the rubber roll dehullers, paddy separators, abrasive milling
(whitening) and possibly frictions mills. Firstly, paddy is dehusked by a rubber roll
sheller to produce brown rice. This process only removes the outermost layer and
hull of the rice. Brown rice is further milled to produce white rice and this involves
the removal of the outer bran layers of the grain, known as rice bran, which is rich
in nutrients.
In the United States, a large quantity of rice bran are produced annually and
used as animal feed due to its high nutritional content. As interest in the research of
value-added processing grows, attempts are made to increase the value of
agricultural crop waste products, such as rice bran, by increasing their
pharmaceutical or nutraceutical potential. While rice bran has traditionally been
utilized in animal food products, there is a thriving interest in the research of
identifying the possible human-health-enhancing compounds in rice bran.
3.2.2 Structure of rice bran
Rice bran consists mainly of the outer layers of rice caryopsis. It includes the
pericarp, seed coat, nucellus, aleurone layer, germ and part of subaleurone layer of
the starchy endosperm. Depending on the variety, it constitutes about 5-15% of the
weight of rough rice. (Hoffpauer, 2005 ; Oliveira, 2010).
Surrounding the caryopsis coat of rice bran, are the pericarp, seed coat and
nucellar layer. The thickness of the pericarp is about 10 µm, which consist of
several crushed cell layers, and a thin cuticle on its outer surface. The interior of
51992). They are commonly found soluble in saline solution because of the net
electrical charge they carry (Hamada, 1997). Rice bran globulins consist of
polypeptide chains of different sizes stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds
(Hamada, 1997).
Rice bran glutelins are insoluble protein that difficult to extract due to
extensive aggregation (Sugimoto et al., 1986), disulfide bonding (Hamada, 1997),
and glycosylation (Wen and Luthe, 1985). Glutelins are found in the irregularly
shaped protein bodies in rice. According to Krishnan et al., (1992), glutelin protein
bodies have fine ultrastructure, resulting from the accumulation of different classes
of proteins, and have complex internal organization.
The smallest fraction among rice bran proteins is prolamin, alcohol-soluble
protein. They are soluble in 60 –70% aqueous ethanol and insoluble or nearly
insoluble in water, but readily soluble in acids or alkalis (Shewry and Casey, 1999).
Hence, prolamin fraction extraction from rice bran would not pose a significant
problem due to its low content and its ability to be co-extracted with the
alkali-soluble protein.
Rice bran contains a high quality hypoallergenic protein that could be suitable
as an additional ingredient in infant food formulations (Helm and Burks, 1996).
There are some potential of rice bran protein that can be applied in food industry
such as,
1. Active peptides preparations: by using specific protease to hydrolyze protein
into functional peptides. For example, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
may be used for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.
2. Nutritional food formulation (Helm and Burks, 1996; Paraman et al., 2007):
Hypoallergenic rice bran protein may use as hypoallergenic protein for infant
milk formula and gluten-free high protein supplements drinks for restricted
diets of human with protein allergy, fiber in healthy foods.
3. Food additive substances: after enzymatic treatment in rice bran, solubility,
foaming and emulsification of rice bran protein could be increased. They are
suitable as an additive for foaming substances or emulsifiers for making bread,
beverages and weaning foods (Prakash, 1996).
4. Animal feed formulations (Hamada, 2000): Rice starch and protein can be
fermented by yeast and the precipitates of fermentation can be high protein
substances that are suitable for animal feed formulations.
Although rice bran protein has many beneficial in application, it is not widely
available commercially. This lacking of availability could be due to the following :
1. Rice bran protein is complex in nature. Rice bran protein contain 37% albumin,
36% globulin, 22% glutelin, and 5% prolamin (Betschart et al., 1977).
2. Poor solubility of rice bran protein due to its strong aggregation and extensive
disulfide bond cross-linking (Hamada, 1995).
3. Rice bran contains high phytate (1.7%), fiber content (12%) and other
7is 7.5-8.0 and the optimum temperature is 27°C. It has a high specificity for
triacylglycerols having short-chain fatty acids (Aizano et al., 1976).
3. Thermally stable lipase: it is found in glycoprotein form with molecular weight
9,400 Da. Its optimum pH is 11.0 and optimum temperature is 80°C. Thermally
stable lipase is capable of hydrolyzing diacylglycerol and
phosphatidylethanolamine. The activity will not be modulated by calcium but it
will inhibited by others divalent cations, Mg2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ (Bhardwaj et al.,
2001).
3.3.1.2 Lipoxygenase (LOX)
Lipooxygenases catalyze oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids containing a
1,4-pentadiene structure, such as linoleic and linolenic acids, into conjugated
hydroperoxy fatty acids, which are decomposed by hydroperoxy fatty acid lyase
and responsible for acidic and soapy flavors (Zhang et al., 2009). In rice grains,
LOXs are mainly located in the bran. There are three kinds of LOX: LOX-1,
LOX-2, LOX-3 with suitable pH at 4.5, 5.5, and 7.0 (Ida et al., 1983).
3.3.1.3 Peroxidase
Peroxidase is enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of some organic substrates
in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Peroxidase is used as a convenient index of
lipase activity (Orthoefer, 2005).
3.3.2 Rice bran stabilization methods
3.3.2.1 Dry heat treatment
By heating 100°C in oven, rice bran moisture level could decrease for about
0.3%. Free fatty acids of rice bran could increase from 6.5% into 7.88% after 7
days storage at 25°C, room temperature (Zhu, 2004).
After dry frying rice bran at 110-140°C for 20 min, 30 min, and 40 min, rice
bran sample after dry frying at 120°C for 40 min showed the best one after storage
at 25°C, room temperature for 90 days. Acid value would be decreased from 6.5%
to 9.1% (Zhong, 2007).
3.3.2.2 Moist heat treatment
After moist heat rice bran with 25% humidity, oven drying at 100°C, moisture
level of rice bran could decrease for about 4.5-6.5%. Rice bran was stored at 25°C,
room temperature for 30 days and it showed that free fatty acids would increase
1% every week (Zhong, 2006).
By utilization 95% ethanol at 78°C for 5 minutes could inactivate enzymes
that cause rancidity, keep rice bran oil quality and increase protein extraction
recovery (Champagne et al., 1992).
3.3.2.3 Extrusion cooking method
Extrusion cooking method is the method that is mostly applied in the food
industry. It can be divide as expanders, moist-extrusions and low-cost extrusion
cookers, dry extrusions.
Extrusion cooking involves high temperature, a short time and high pressure.
9functional rice bran protein (Parrado et al., 2006).
3.5 Protein extraction
Rice bran is known-well as high protein content. It includes glutelin, globulin,
albumin and prolamin. There are several methods in protein extraction:
1. Alkaline extraction method: by using alkaline to make starch bound weaker and
protein become easier to soluble. This process consists of starch gelatinization, a
two-stage alkaline extraction of protein followed by acid precipitation. The
advantages of this method are simple procedure and economical (Connor et al.,
1976). But alkaline solutions may cause environment pollution, chemical changes,
reduce nutritional value, and form toxic compounds such as lysinoalanine (De Groot
and Slumps, 1969).
2. Enzymatic extraction method: By using enzymatic proteolysis to increase protein
solubilization. A protein hydrolysis produces a wide range of smaller proteins and
peptides that are more soluble in water and have good functional properties (Giese,
1994). There are also combination of several enzymes in a protein extraction that
may increase protein extraction. Protein from enzymatic extraction method may
filtrate and use directly without any acid or base precipitation so the functional
protein would be better and high digestibility. But it spends more time and requires
high cost.
3. Combination of alkaline and enzymatic extraction method: After alkaline
treatment to produce alkaline soluble protein, it would be followed by treatment
with α-amylase in converting starch into glucose so it may loose t*he protein and
starch binding. Then, use the alkaline methods, acid and base precipitation to
separate protein.
4. Others methods: Sonication, freeze-thaw, and high pressure are the physical
processing methods used to disrupt and extract cell wall components (Tang et al.,
2002). Applications of physical processing followed by enzymatic treatment are
used in protein extraction. These methods may enhance protein extractions by
breakdown large particles become small particles, breakdown starch and protein
bounding, increasing the enzyme reaction and its surface on sample so high protein
extraction can be achieved and less time required.

After enzymatic treatments, raw rice bran, microwave stabilized rice bran with
initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 s, and defatted microwave stabilized
rice bran with initial moisturecontent of 25.0%, heated for 150s with/without α-amylase
enzymatic treatment were extracted their insoluble protein contents. Solvents that used
are 0.1 M NaOH, 0.5 M NaCl, 75% ethanol and dd H2O. For protein extraction, 5%
2-mercaptoethanol was added to all solvents.
0.1 g of rice bran sample was mixed with 1 ml of solvent. Solutions were shaking
for 1 hour, and then centrifuged at 17,000 x g, 4°C for 10 minutes for supernatants and
precipitate separations. 0.5 ml of solvents would be added to the precipitate then
shaking for 30 minutes, this step would be repeated twice. Supernatants were collected
and stored at 4°C until use (max. 7 days). Rice bran protein sample was precipitated by
acetone and dissolved in water. Insoluble protein content and soluble protein content
were analyzed by Kjeldahl method.

4.3.4 Residual starch contents analysis
Sample preparation: 0.5 g of sample was washed twice to remove the residual
sugar. Then, adding 2 ml of distilled water on sample, boiled at 100°C for 15 minutes.
Sample was vortex well every 3 minutes. Cool sample on water bath after boiled before
adding 2 ml of 9.2 N HClO4 and allow sample to react with it for 15 minutes. Adding
distilled water on sample until 10 ml then centrifuged at 3,220 x g, 4°C for 15 minutes.
Supernatants were dissolved into distilled water until 50 ml.
Residual starch content analysis determined by using anthrone solutions. 0.5 ml of
sample mixed well with 5 ml of anthrone, boiled at 100°C for 10 minutes, cooled at
water bath and measured its absorbance at 620 nm (Yoshida et al., 1976). D-glucose
was used as a standard curve.

at 100°C for 5 minutes and later cooled at room temperature. Adding 5 mL of distilled
water on sample and measure its absorbance at 540 nm. Glucose was used as a standard
curve in reducing sugar analysis.
4.3.6 Protein content analysis
Rice bran protein samples that used for SDS-PAGE were determined their protein
contents by Bradford assay. 100 µl of sample mixed with 900µl of Coomassie Brilliant
Blue G-250 dye reagent (dye must be dilute with ddH2O with comparison 1 : 4). After
react for 5 minutes, sample was measured at 595 nm absorbance. Bovine serum albumin
(BSA) was used as a protein standard in protein content determination.

5.2.1 Effects of initial moisture content and microwave stabilization heating time &
temperature on lipase inactivation
To study the influences of moisture content, heating time and temperature on lipase
inactivation, the residual lipase activities of rice bran with different initial moisture
contents after different heating time of microwave were analyzed (Figure 5.1).
Several studies have shown that inactivation of rice bran lipase depends upon
temperature and duration of heat treatment and on the moisture content, the latter being
critical (Barber and Bendito de Barber, 1980). In this study, rice bran samples were
adjusted by adding distilled water to 15.0%, 21.0%, 25.0%, and 30.0% from an initial
value of 7.3%, respectively, thoroughly mixed for several minutes for an even moisture
distribution. Results showed that increase in initial moisture and heating period would
follow by increase in temperature on microwave stabilization treatment which could
promote lipase inactivation. This result was similar with Vetrimani et al.(1992)’s study 
which showed that microwave heat treatment varying in severity has been able to
inactivate lipase and lipoxygenase in cereal bran, germ, and soybean.
Rice bran sample with initial moisture content of 7.3% showed that after microwave
stabilization on different interval times(0 s ~ 180 s), temperature increased from 27.67 ±
0.64 °C to 101.97 ± 1.59 °C. When rice bran sample with initial moisture content of
7.3% was heated by microwave stabilization from 0 s ~ 180 s, the lipase activity was
reduced from 3.51 ± 0.06 U/g to 3.13 ± 0.11 U/g. Lipase inactivation on rice bran
sample with initial moisture content of 7.3% did not show any significant different
between them. Rice bran samples lipase percentage removal by microwave heating
between 0 s and 150 s was about 1.8%. While the heating time was increased for 180 s,
lipase removal (%) was about 11.0%. However, heating sample by microwave between
0 s, 30 s, 60 s, 90 s, and 120 s did not showed any different on lipase removal (%).
After microwave heating treatment on several intervals of time, the temperature of
rice bran sample with initial moisture content of 15.0% was increased from 27.67 ± 0.80
°C to 115.57 ± 0.76 °C. Rice bran lipase activity heating for 180 s reduced from 3.22 ±
0.09 to 2.86 ± 2.91 U/g. Lipase removal of rice bran after microwave stabilization
treatment were about 11.18%.

reach about 100 ~ 126°C.
For the changes on lipase activity on Table 5.2, it also showed no significant
differences for the rice bran sample with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 60
seconds. And for the sample with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150
seconds, once until three times showed no significant differences on lipase inactivation
(for about 66 ~ 79%). But after heated rice bran sample with initial moisture content of
25.0% for 150 seconds for four times until five times, lipase inactivation was about 82 ~
85%.
Keying, et al. (2009)’s study on inactivation of lipase in naked oat kernel suggested 
that the critical factor in the lipase inactivation by steam quantity expressed as moisture
loss, rather than the moisture content. In addition, temperature is another important
factor affecting lipase inactivation.
Rice bran with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 seconds showed a
higher activity in lipase inactivation (%) than rice bran sample with initial moisture
content of 25.0%, heated for 60 seconds. Heating rice bran samples with initial moisture
content of 25.0% for 150 seconds several times intermittently could increase the lipase
inactivation (%) but the defects were changes in color and decrease in the rice bran
quality thereby, limiting it for further use. So, in this study, rice bran sample with initial
moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 seconds once time was chosen for further
experiment as it may reduce lipase activity without changing color appearances.
5.3. Sample preparation and storage conditions for acid value determination
In this study, raw rice bran (moisture content 7.3%) was used as a control, rice bran
with initial moisture content of 25.0% without any heat treatment, and microwave
stabilized rice bran samples with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 60
seconds, 150 seconds (once) and 150 s (twice) were samples for acid value
determination after 12 weeks of storage on different storage temperatures. All rice bran
samples were stored inside centrifuge tubes. Rice bran samples were determined for
their acid value levels from each new centrifuge tube stored at 4°C, 25°C, and 40°C
every week for 12 weeks.
The main factors for deterioration of rice bran during storage are microbial molds,
insects and enzymatic activity (Priyankara and Weerathilake, 2009).
5.3.1 Effect of rice bran moisture contents and microwave stabilization heating
time on acid value
From these experiments, rice bran sample with higher moisture contents would easily
deteriorate compared to lower one. Rice bran with initial moisture content of 25.0%
without heating was shown as the one that easy to deterioration. Rice bran with initial
moisture content of 25.0% heated for 60 seconds and heated for 150 seconds (once) and
150 seconds (twice) influenced rice bran storage stability due to decreasing in moisture
content (%) and moisture activity (Aw) of rice bran after microwave heating.

5.3.2 Effect of storage temperature of rice bran on acid value levels
Storage temperature is also one of the important major factors that influence rice
bran storage stability. In this experiment, rice bran was stored at 4°C, 25°C (room
temperature’s simulation), and 40°C. When rice bran was stored at low temperature,
acid value levels increased slowly. The higher the storage temperature on rice bran
storage experiments will promote the increasing of acid value levels.
5.3.3 Effect of duration of storage of rice bran on acid value levels
Besides of rice bran moisture contents (%), moisture activity (Aw), microwave
heating time, and storage temperature; duration of storage also may influence the
increasing of acid value. The longer the duration of storage, the higher the acid value
levels of samples. When rice bran samples were stored at lower temperature,
increasing in duration of storage would increase the acid value levels slowly and
when rice bran samples were stored at higher temperature, acid value levels would
increase faster.
On Figure 5.3, there is no significant difference between all rice bran samples
acid value on the 0 week (first day) and first week when it stored at 4°C (p < 0.05).
For the raw rice bran samples with moisture content of 7.3%, stored at 4°C, acid value
levels started to increase from the seconds weeks and on the third weeks, acid value
levels increased from 0.86 ± 0.06 mg KOH/g to 2.59 ± 0.05 mg KOH/g, for about
66.8%. The rice bran sample with initial moisture content of 25.0% without any heat
treatment showed the highest acid value levels among all samples when it stored at
4°C. Acid value of rice bran sample with initial moisture content of 25.0% without
any heat treatment, stored at 4°C on the third weeks increased from 0.98 ± 0.04 mg
KOH/g to 3.39 ± 0.02 mg KOH/g. Rice bran samples with initial moisture content of
25.0%, heated for 60 s, stored at 4°C showed an increase in acid value from 0.88 ±
0.07 mg KOH/g to 2.20 ± 0.03 mg KOH/g on the third week. There is no significant
difference for rice bran sample with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150
seconds once or twice. For the rice bran sample with initial moisture content of 25.0%,
heated for 150 seconds once, acid value levels increased from 0.82 ± 0.04 mg KOH/g
to 2.09 ± 0.08 mg KOH/g on the third week of storage period at 4°C. This result
proved that after the microwave stabilization of rice bran for lipase inactivation may
allow acid value to increase gradually.
When all rice bran samples stored at 25°C (room temperature), there was also the
same conditions found for this case. The rice bran samples with higher moisture
contents could increase their acid value levels faster than the lower one. Due to 25°C
storage temperature was higher than 4°C storage temperature, the acid value levels
between all samples also would be higher. On the first week, rice bran sample with
initial moisture content of 25.0%, without any heat treatment showed increase in acid
27
stable acid value levels if they were compared to others samples.
The increasing of acid value levels of rice bran samples with initial moisture
content of 7.3%, rice bran samples with initial moisture content of 25.0%, without any
heat treatment, rice bran samples with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 60
seconds, rice bran samples with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150
seconds and rice bran samples with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150
seconds twice on the third week are from 0.86 ± 0.06 mg KOH/g to 3.43 ± 0.07 mg
KOH/g, 0.98 ± 0.04 mg KOH/g to 4.44 ± 0.02 mg KOH/g, 0.88 ± 0.07 mg KOH/g to
3.01 ± 0.03 mg KOH/g, 0.82 ± 0.04 mg KOH/g to 2.27 ± 0.03 mg KOH/g, and 0.91 ±
0.01 mg KOH/g to 2.19 ± 0.05 mg KOH/g.
In this study, acid value levels of rice bran samples that stored at 40°C also were
investigated. Acid value levels of all rice bran samples increased drastically after the
first week of storage. The rice bran samples with initial moisture content of 25.0%
without any heat treatment had full-grown mold on the surface and pungent odors.
Acid value levels of the rice bran sample with initial moisture content of 25.0%
without any heat treatment had increased to 3.17 ± 0.01 mg KOH/g during the first
week. Others acid value levels of sample also increased faster on the first week. This
might prove that high storage temperature may promote the increasing of acid value.
Rice bran samples with different initial moisture content and different
microwave stabilization heating time might influence the duration of storage time at
different storage temperatures. Acid value of rice bran samples would increase
followed by increasing in duration of storage. The higher the moisture content of rice
bran, the higher the acid value levels would be. When rice bran sample with initial
moisture content of 25.0% was heated for 150 seconds, its acid value would increase
gradually. Data of acid value levels of rice bran samples when they stored at different
storage temperature (4°C, 25°C, and 40°C) were shown on Table 5.4-5.8.
Based on the letter No. 0980461457 from Food and Drug Administration of
Taiwan on 11th September 2009 about the indicator for changing frying oil for
restaurants, the acceptable amount of acid value levels is less than 2.0 mg KOH/g.
From the acid value levels of rice bran samples with different treatments and stored
on different temperature (°C) for 12 weeks, raw rice bran with moisture content of
7.3% may be stored for 7 weeks at 4°C, a week at 25°C and 40°C. Rice bran with
initial moisture content of 25.0%, without any heat treatment may store at 4°C and
25°C for a week and it could not store at 40°C as the temperature is too high and the
acid values levels was not on the standard level. Rice bran with initial moisture
content of 25.0%, heated for 60 seconds may be stored at 4°C for 11 weeks, 25°C for
a week, and it also could not be stored at 40°C. Rice bran with initial moisture content
of 25.0%, heated for 150 seconds one time may store at 4°C and 25°C above 12

weeks and at 40°C for a week. And rice bran with initial moisture content of 25.0%,
heated for 150 seconds twice may be stored at 4°C, 25°C, and 40°C for above 12 weeks.
But the shortages of this sample are low moisture contents that cause the changes on
color appearance after heating. The probability of changes on color appearance on some
part of rice bran samples may be caused by uneven of moisture distribution in the
sample preparation. Therefore, rice bran with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated
for 150 seconds once showed high lipase inactivation without any physically changes on
rice bran, it was chosen as sample for further experiments.
From Table 5.9, it showed the correlation between different microwave stabilization
treatments of rice bran samples, different period of storage times, and acid values levels.
By using the Pearson Correlation two-tailed probabilities, it showed that the correlation
between different microwave stabilization treatments of rice bran samples and acid
value levels was a negative low correlation; correlation between increasing in period of
storage and acid value levels was positive middle correlation. Basically, it showed that
increasing on period of storage time would influence the increasing on acid value levels.
When the rice bran microwave stabilization treatments was longer in heating time with
adequate initial moisture contents, acid value levels would increase gradually.
5.4. Comparison of hexane and ethanol for defatted microwave stabilization rice bran
In this experiment, microwave stabilized rice bran samples were defatted by hexane and
ethanol. Hexane is used as a common solvent for lipid extraction. However, hexane
poses potential fire, health, and environmental hazards. As a mild solvent, 95% ethanol
was chosen as the substitute for hexane due to its more environment-friendly and easy to
handle its waste substances. The aim for defatted rice bran sample was to reduce any
35
disturbing substances in protein extraction for further experiments.
Short-chain alcohols, especially ethanol and isopropanol have a potential as
alternative lipid extraction solvents due to their greater safety. Alcohols tend to extract
more non-glyceride materials than hexane, due to their great polarity (Johnson et al.,
1983).
Defatted rice bran with solvent-to-bran ratio 1:15 (w/v), extraction temperature
30°C, 40 minutes for three times was studied for hexane and 95% ethanol solvents for
defatted rice bran. Comparison of lipid removal (%) from rice bran by using hexane and
95% ethanol was investigated (Table 5.10). The percentage of lipid removal by hexane
was 93.06 ± 0.96 %. And by using 95% ethanol, lipid removal was 91.56 ± 0.24 %.
These results showed that defatted rice bran by hexane and ethanol almost showed
similar effectiveness. Therefore, ethanol is a promising alternative mild solvent to
defatted rice bran sample.
5.5. Biotransformation by α-amylase enzymatic treatment on rice bran
In this experiment, biotransformation mediated by enzymes was used to enhance the
protein extraction. α-amylase was used to hydrolyze the starch to release protein bound to
starch. Raw rice bran, microwave stabilized rice bran with initial moisture content of
25.0%, heated for 150 seconds and defatted microwave stabilized rice bran with initial
moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 seconds were treated by α-amylase and their
residual starch content, residual sugar contents, insoluble and soluble protein contents
were compared.

In this study, protein retained (%) of the α-amylase enzymatic treatment at 55°C,
pH 6.5 on several different concentrations and vary in different treatment time were
about 40.78% ~ 54.20%. On Shih et al.(1999)’s study showed that by using Termamyl 
120L, α-amylase on rice bran treatment would give 86.6% of protein retained.
Comparing this study and Shih et al. (1999), the amounts of protein retained in this
study was accounted for slightly less than half of the protein retained from Shih et al.
(1999)’s study. The reason might be due to diferentkinds of enzyme that used in the
experiment, different methods in enzymatic treatments including different pH,
temperature and time for the enzymatic treatments.

5.6 Rice bran protein extraction by using several solvents
In this study, raw rice bran, microwave stabilized rice bran with initial moisture content
of 25.0%, heated for 150 s, and defatted microwave stabilized rice bran with initial
moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 s with/without α-amylase enzymatic
treatment were extracted their proteins by 0.1 M NaOH, 0.5 M NaCl, dd H2O, and 75%
EtOH solvents. 5% of 2-mercaptoethanol were added to all solvents. Rice bran
sampleswere extracted twice to enhance their protein contents.
Rice bran proteins, a complex nature proteins consist of 37% albumin
(water-soluble protein), 36% globulin (salt-soluble protein), 22% glutelin (alkali-soluble
protein) and 5% prolamin (alcohol-soluble protein) (Betschart et al., 1977). Studies on
the extraction of rice bran protein started in the early 1970s. However, it remains a
challenge in the extraction of rice bran protein until now due to aggregation and
extensive disulfide bond cross-linking its poor solubility (Hamada, 1997).
Protein extraction by alkali solution, NaOH can break hydrogen, amide, and
disulfide bonds in proteins (Hamada, 1997). Extraction yields by alkali solution at pH
7-12 were about 30-80% (Betschart et al., 1977; Chen and Houston, 1970; Gupta et al.,
2008; Lew et al., 1975).
5.6 Protein molecular-weight distribution by sodium-dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
Raw rice bran (control), raw rice bran treated by 0.6% of α-amylase, microwave
stabilized rice bran with initial moisture content 25.0%, heated for 150 seconds
(control), microwave stabilized rice bran with initial moisture content 25.0%, heated for
150 seconds treated by 0.6% ofα-amylase, defatted microwave stabilized rice bran with
initial moisture content 25.0%, heated for 150 seconds (control), defatted microwave
stabilized rice bran with initial moisture content 25.0%, heated for 150 seconds treated
by 0.6% of α-amylase at 30°C, pH 6.5 for 30 minutes proteins patterns from different
extraction solvents were examined by SDS-PAGE. PageRulerTM prestained protein
ladder with molecular weights from 10 kDa to 170 kDa was used as protein molecular
weight standard.
In the traditional protein extraction (Osborne) method, protein extraction by water
is used to obtain albumin fraction, followed by sequential extraction with salt solution,
alkali, and ethanol to obtain globulin, glutelin, and prolamin fractions, respectively
(Padhye and Salunkhe, 1979). On Agboola et al., (2005)’s study reported that molecular
weight of protein isolates prepared by the traditional extraction (Osborne) method and
characterized by SDS-PAGE, molecular weights of glutelin fraction were 15.8 kDa,
19.7 kDa, 21.4 kDa, and 38.5 kDa. In addition, charaterization of glutelin fractions by
capillary electrophoresis were 5.9 kDa, 12.7 kDa, 21.4 kDa, 29.5 kDa, 39.8 kDa
(Agboola et al., 2005). On Figure 5.8, amylase showed complex SDS-PAGE patterns
between 10 kDa, 23.3 kDa, 33.9 –37.3 kDa, 44.3 kDa, and 67.5 kDa. Raw rice bran,
microwave stabilized rice bran with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150
seconds, and defatted microwave stabilized rice bran with initial moisture content of
53
α-amylase enzymatic treatments on 67.5 kDa probably due to molecular weights of
α-amylase. And the molecular weight of 22.6 kD, 27.3 kDa, and 34.5 kDa probably due
to glutelin fractions which are within the ranges reported by Agboola et al. (2005).
Glutelins are known as high molecular weights compounds and difficult to
hydrolyzed (Agboola et al., 2005). Krishnan et al. (1992) reported that stronger alkali
solution for rice bran protein extraction revealed 2 major subgroups of glutelin proteins,
theα-polypeptides with molecular weights of 34 - 39 kDa, and the ß-polypeptides with
molecular weights of 21-23 kDa. From Figure 5.8, defatted microwave stabilized rice
bran with initial moisture content of 25.0%, heated for 150 seconds with/without
α-amylase enzymatic treatments showed the molecular weights of glutelin on 22.6 kDa
which probably the ß-polypeptides of glutelin. In this study, rice bran proteins were not
separated their size by size-exclusion chromatography. Hence, there would be the
probability others kind of proteins besides of glutelin was extracted by 0.1 M NaOH and
some molecular weights of glutelin could not be detected due to impurity of protein.
When all rice bran samples were extracted with 0.5 M NaCl, the bands of
α-amylase were between 11.0 kDa, 13.8 kDa, 22.8 kDa, 33.7 kDa, 47.1 kDa, 54.2 kDa,
67.7 kDa, and 82.4 kDa. For all rice bran samples with/without α-amylase enzymatic
treatments showed the similar bands position between 8.1 kDa, 11.6 kDa, 18.2 kDa,
23.7 kDa, 27.7 kDa, 31.9 kDa, 42.1 kDa, 51.2 kDa, 65.9 kDa, 71.6 kDa, and 81.2 kDa
(Figure 5.9). There were some similarities between the molecular weights ofα-amylase
and rice bran protein. However, raw rice bran samples with α-amylase enzymatic
treatment showed one more bands on 21.5 kDa.
Rice bran proteins that are readily soluble in saline solution are globulin (Hamada,
1997). Agboola et al. (2005) reported globulin molecular weight were 13.9 kDa, 17.1
kDa, 21.5 kDa, 32.1 kDa, 39.9 kDa, and 54.8 kDa prepared by the traditional protein
extraction (Osborne) method and characterized by SDS-PAGE. When globulin fractions
were characterized by capillary electrophoresis, molecular weights were between 22.9
kDa, 26.9 kDa, 37.9 kDa, 53.7 kDa, 97.7 kDa, and 104.7 kDa. Comparing the previous
results by Agboola et al., 2005 with this study, the molecular weight 21.5 kDa was due
to globulin fractions. Molecular weight 31.9 kDa and 42.1 kDa were also probably due
to globulin. Two rice globulin polypeptide have been identified using SDS-PAGE were
the 25 kDa and the 16 kDa polypeptides (Krishnan et al., 1992). The 25 kDa fraction is
the major polypeptide of rice globulin (Pan and Reeck, 1988; Krishnan et al., 1992).
The slightly differences molecular weight between previous study and this study might
be cause by different on estimation of molecular weight.
Figure 5.10 was the SDS-PAGE patterns of rice bran proteins samples extracted by
water. There were rice bran protein molecular weights between 18.2 kDa, 22.6 kDa,
31.7 kDa, 33.0 kDa, and 59.9 kDa. Albumin is a rice bran protein that soluble in water
due to the presence of sufficient net charge and the lack of any extensive disulfide
bonding (Hamada, 1997; Shewry and Casey, 1999). The α-amylase molecular weights
were between 24.2 kDa, 34.8 kDa, 48.3 kDa, and 59.9 kDa. In previous study by
55
and 55.0 kDa. The rice bran sample with molecular weight of 18.2 kDa was probably
due to albumin. There were no significant different on SDS-PAGE patterns of all rice
bran samples. In addition, rice bran sample also had the same molecular weights
patterns withα-amylase on 59.9 kDa.
In the rice bran protein, prolamin was the smallest fraction content of protein. It
was about 4%. Prolamin is small molecular weights of rice bran protein that are
alcohol-soluble. There are two major groups of polypeptides in rice prolamin with
molecular weights of 15.5 and 14.2 kDa (Shyur and Chen, 1994).
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis patterns of rice bran protein extraction by 75% EtOH
was shown in Figure 5.11. The molecular weights of α-amylase were between 11.1
kDa, 24.1 kDa, 35.4 kDa, 44.0 kDa, and 67.6 kDa. Raw rice bran proteins with/without
α-amylase enzymatic treatments showed the SDS-PAGE patterns bands more clearly
compared to microwave stabilized rice bran and defatted microwave stabilized rice
bran samples. The molecular weight of raw rice bran samples were between 12.6 kDa,
20.8 kDa, 27.8 kDa, 44.0 kDa, and 69.6 kDa. On the defatted microwave stabilized rice
bran sample, there was only the molecular weight of 69.6 kDa bands showed clearly.
There was the probability that defatted sample process and enzymatic hydrolysis on
defatted sample would remove protein contents. When sample was defatted, enzyme
also could work easier to attack rice bran starch structure.
According to the Agboola et al. (2005)’s results, molecular weight of prolamin
extracted by Osborne method and characterized by SDS-PAGE were between 15.4 kDa,
21.9 kDa, 25.8 kDa, and 41.4 kDa. Molecular weights of prolamin were between 12.8
kDa, 37.7 kDa, 43.7 kDa, 45.3 kDa, 49.0 kDa, and 105.2 kDa when molecular weights
of prolamin were characterized by capillary electrophoresis.
By comparing previous study by Agboola et al. (2005) and this study, the
molecular weight of 12.6 kDa, 20.8 kDa, 27.8 kDa were probably due to prolamin
molecular weights. A slightly different between the molecular weight might due to the
molecular weight estimation. There were no significant different on molecular weights
between rice bran sample with/withoutα-amylase enzymatic treatments.
In this study, all rice bran protein samples with/without α-amylase enzymatic
treatments showed the same polypeptides patterns on SDS-PAGE. There were no
smeared bands of polypeptides for the protein. It might prove thatα-amylase enzymatic
treatment at 55°C, pH 6.5 for 30 minutes did not cause any substantial damage to
protein.

content would burn up so the color appearance also had changed. For the future,
there are some possibilities to find the best method in rice bran preparation such as
vacuum-packaging of sample for microwave heating treatment to reduce moisture
content loss with the higher lipase inactivation expectation.
- All rice bran samples with/withoutα-amylase enzymatic treatment at 55°C with pH
6.5 for 30 minutes was examined their protein patterns by SDS-PAGE. There were
no smeared bands of polypeptides for the rice bran proteins with α-amylase
enzymatic treatment. It might prove that α-amylase enzymatic treatment did not
cause substantial damage to the protein. For the future study, separation of protein
using high-performance liquid chromatography could help protein separation based
on its molecular weight. Hence, certain proteins of rice bran could be recognized
easily.
Chapter 8 Future Prospects
There are several future prospects that can be achieved from this study:
- Stabilized rice bran by microwave stabilization treatment could reduce lipase
activity and extend its shelf-life. In the future, the application of rice bran can be
developing as large as possible because rice bran becomes more convenience to
keep in a long period of time.
- After biotransformation by α-amylase enzymatic treatment on rice bran to reduce
starch by converting it into sugars. Protein would be easier to separate from these
components. All rice bran samples with/without α-amylase enzymatic treatment at
55°C with pH 6.5 for 30 minutes was examined their protein patterns by SDS-PAGE.
There were no smeared bands of polypeptides for the rice bran proteins with
α-amylase enzymatic treatment. It might prove that α-amylase enzymatic treatment
did not cause substantial damage to the protein. Hence, α-amylase has the potential
as the enzyme that promote the protein extraction in the future. In addition, by using
this low-cost and efficient method, the potential of protein as hypoallergenic protein
in food formulation, foaming and emulsifying properties could be develop largely.
