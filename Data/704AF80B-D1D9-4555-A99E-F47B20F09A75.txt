二、 緣由與目的 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In recent years, the wireless technology has become 
the most exciting domain in telecommunications and 
networking. Integrating wireless networks poses a new 
challenge. The main reason is that the TCP/IP based 
Internet technologies were designed for wired 
networks with mostly fixed hosts. When mobile device 
moves from a wireless network to another, the 
challenge is that mobile device has to change the IP 
without disconnecting the connection. 
Providing multimedia applications such as video 
conferencing, real time video, audio and video 
streaming which are common now a days in the 
Internet, is considered to be very challenging and 
demanding over wireless networks. In wireless 
networks limited bandwidth support and lack of 
Quality of Service (QoS) at the air interface restrain 
wide deployment of these multimedia applications. 
One of the factors that affect the QoS is the transport 
protocol. The application performance can vary 
significantly when different transport protocols are 
employed. Currently UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is 
mostly used for the transport of multimedia 
applications. However, UDP performance is not 
satisfactory due to several constraints such as lock of 
congestion control mechanism. 
The purpose of this paper is to implement a 
handover video/audio application using the feature 
“multi-homing”, “multi-streaming” and “partial 
reliable” of SCTP (Stream Control Transmission 
Protocol) [1] bases on Linux, providing the handover 
procedure. In this thesis, we will show the design of 
the architecture and mechanism. 
 
2. Motivation 
 
With the steady improvement of computer system 
and prevalence of the Internet service, there are more 
and more new types of services and applications 
applied, such as real-time multimedia service. 
However, those services and applications are often 
bandwidth-intensive and require high throughput 
connections to be comfortable to end users. The 
network today consists of different types of networks, 
including dial-up modem connections, broadband 
ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) accesses, 
and many kinds of wireless network (WLAN, 3G or 
Satellite), each of them provides different data rates 
and delays. By the conditions described above, it is 
problematic to do the large scale deployment of 
various kinds of real-time applications across 
heterogeneous network environment, particularly in 
reliable streaming of multimedia (audio/video) content 
over the Internet. 
It is well-known that audio stream transmitted are 
through Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [2] 
relying on UDP, which provides no loss recovery 
(unreliable). Using TCP rather than UDP, it may cause 
long delay to get obsolete data at receiver side. 
We use the SCTP feature “multi-homing” to 
achieve the handover procedure between two different 
sub-networks and use the “SCTP Partial Reliable 
Extension” to transmit video/audio streaming data in 
time. 
 
3. Related works 
 
Seamless handover goals to provide continuous 
connection for an end-to-end data transmission in the 
face of any link outage or handover event. The two 
most design issues are low packet loss and low latency. 
Low latency requires that the switch to the new path be 
completed almost immediately; service interruption 
should be minimized to provide the illusion of 
continuous connectivity. In the event of actual 
connection failure, the architecture should attempt to 
re-connect as soon as the service becomes available, 
and the packet loss due to the connection switch 
should also be minimized. 
Seamless handoff has been studied extensively [3] 
[4] [5] [6]. The solutions can be classified into two 
categories: mobile IP [7] solutions and mobile IP-less 
solutions. The mobile IP solutions are typically based 
on IPv6 [8] or Mobile IPv4 [9] standards, requiring the 
deployment of different agents on the Internet for 
relaying and/or redirecting the data to the moving 
mobile host (MH). Most Mobile IP-less solutions 
implement a new session layer above the transport 
layer to make the application sessions transparent to 
the connection changes in the underlying layers [10] 
[11] [12] [13]. Other mobile IP-less solutions suggest 
new transport layer protocols such as SCTP and TCP-
MH [14] to provide the necessary handover support. 
Transmitting network has to cooperate by each 
protocol layer. At present, network layer, transport 
layer and application layer has the protocol to support 
the mobility management in the wireless network. The 
Table 1 shows the each layer which can support the 
mobility management.

map a logical address to different devices, and also 
map different addresses to the same device. 
Service Mobility: It lets the user can keep original 
service information when the device changes the ISP. 
Session Mobility: It allows users to keep the 
original session when users changes device. Using 
Third-part Call Control [16] and Call Transfer allows 
that the old device informs the new device to perform 
handover procedure and to create new session. 
Terminal Mobility: when the device moves from a 
subnet to another, this will keep the connection. There 
are three mechanisms to keep the session, when the 
device moves from subnet to another. 
Pre-Call: It performs the handover before calling. 
During the handover procedure, a mobile node gets 
new CoA and re-registers with Home Registrar. When 
a CN wants to communicate with a MN, the CN 
requests the latest CoA through Redirect Server. After 
getting the latest CoA, the CN will announce INVITE 
to the MN. 
Mid-Call: It performs the handover during the 
communication. When a handover procedure occurs in 
the communication, the MN will announce INVITE to 
CN again. SDP (Session Description Protocol) and 
new INVITE of CoA without passing through any 
middle SIP Proxy. It will generate One-Way delay (the 
delay of MN announces INVITE to CN to inform new 
IP address). 
Network partitions: When there is no response 
after announce request for a while, it has to re-start the 
transmitting mechanism. If there is no response for a 
long time, it means the connection is broken. Then, we 
have to re-build the connection. 
In order to achieve the fast-handover, MN sends 
the RTP Translator address of SIP Proxy instead of the 
CoA of MN. Proxy will re-write the SDP address 
while the handover procedure is performed, and the 
packet will redirect to the correct address of MN by 
RTP Translator. 
4. Stream Control Transport Protocol  
 
Transmission Control Protocol over Internet 
Protocol (TCP/IP) has survived exponential growth in 
the Internet without significant modification, which is 
a testament to its robustness and ability to scale. 
However, a number of different groups have found that 
it is improper for their needs. For example, multimedia 
communities find the congestion control mechanisms 
TCP employs are too restrictive. Wireless and mobile 
users also find that TCP reacts badly to losses and 
delay variations due to wireless links and handovers. 
As well as TCP, a second transport protocol, UDP 
(User Datagram Protocol) provides an unreliable 
datagram delivery service, which does not suffice 
under some conditions either. Until the late 2001, the 
requirements of the telecommunication signaling 
community resulted in a third protocol being 
standardized by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task 
Force). This is known as SCTP and, although it shares 
many characteristics with TCP, it has many significant 
and interesting differences. The SCTP is a reliable 
message-oriented protocol that provides its services at 
the same level as the TCP and UDP (as shown in Fig. 
3). It provides reliable transmission of packets 
(datagram) between two hosts over a potentially 
unreliable network, such as IP. An SCTP connection 
between two hosts is know as an “association” and is 
identified by a source port/destination port and a 
Verification Tag. Its congestion control and 
retransmission schemes are similar to TCP. 
 
Figure 3. Layered architecture of the IP stack 
We will introduce some SCTP features below: 
z SCTP Multi-homing: As shown in Fig. 4, an 
SCTP association consists of two end-points 
that communicate over the Internet. If either 
or both of these end-points are hosted on a 
multi-homed node, the association can use 
any of the available IP addresses when 
transmitting packets. The capability to select 
an IP address from a set in this manner is 
referred to as multi-homing at the transport 
layer. In many cases of interest, including 
when multi-homing is configured to provide 
redundancy or to improve the performance of 
mobile devices, each IP address also 
represents a different Point-of-Attachment to 
the Internet. In particular, the multi-homing 
feature of SCTP enables SCTP to be used for 
mobility support, without network routers 
such as special agents.

Figure 7. The manager information structure of each peer IP 
When the host receives a data from a particular IP 
address, the system will update the receiving time of 
the particular IP address. If the host does not receive 
any data within a certain period, the system will 
declare the particular IP inactive. After declaring the 
primary address inactive, the application will search an 
available IP from IP list to be primary address. If there 
is no available IP in the IP list, the application will 
warn the user and disconnect the communication. The 
flow is shown in Fig. 8 and the function is shown in 
Fig. 9. 
 
Figure 8. A flow chart of detecting timer 
 
Figure 9. Checks the gap between now and latest receiving time 
For the primary path, we detect the connectivity by 
receiving within certain period time. If the user of the 
other endpoint does not send any data to local host, the 
system will send the confirm data periodically to let 
the local host know the remote IP is connected. 
For the other redundant paths, we use the other 
feature of SCTP, “heartbeat mechanism”, the system 
will send HEARTBEAT chunk to the idle paths. The 
application can control the heartbeat and set the error 
threshold for an address. The error threshold is the 
number of missed heartbeats or retransmission 
timeouts that must occur before a destination address is 
considered unreachable. When the destination address 
becomes reachable, detected by heartbeats, the address 
becomes active. 
In this paper, we will find the suitable x value and 
if there is no data sent by the remote end, how long we 
should send the confirm packet to remote packet. 
In SCTP protocol, each streaming number has its 
own buffer to store data. In our experiment, when the 
application program detects the path failed, it will 
change the stream number to avoid the lost data to 
block the following data; consequently, a new 
streaming number is used to transmit the following 
data.

Base on IHU project [18], SCTP_IHWU where 
IHWU means “I hear you and watch you as well” is a 
multi-networked audio/video communication system. 
Communication can seamlessly switch from the 
original network (like 802.11b) to another network 
(GPRS or 3G), when the 802.11b wireless network is 
disconnected. We adopt the SCTP partial reliability 
extension to make the transmission real-time. We also 
adopt the multi-streaming to let host send 
Video/Audio/Special Packet by different streams 
independently.

6.3.5 Transmission Path Setting and Monitor 
 
As shown in Fig. 16, there is a monitor for 
checking IP address and a “Set Primary Path” button 
under the monitor. After connecting with your partner, 
in multi-network case, you can check which IP address 
is the primary address to transmit data and receive data 
through this monitor. The green ball indicates the 
address is the primary address, and the blue ball 
indicates the following address is secondary address. 
The red ball indicates the address is unreachable. And 
the “Set Primary Path” button is used to set primary 
path. You can choose an IP address which you want to 
set to be primary path, and then click “Set Primary 
Path” button to change the original path to it.

6.4 Transmit using multi-streaming 
 
The multi-streaming feature separates and transmits 
user data on multiple SCTP streams. These streams are 
capable of independent, sequenced delivery. Message 
loss in a particular stream will only hinder delivery 
within that stream. Therefore, other streams within an 
association are not affected. 
We use transmit video/audio/special packet by 
different streaming number as show in Fig. 17. In 
SCTP, each streaming has its own buffer to store data 
from the streaming number. After the handoff, the 
application will wait for the lost data in the handover 
procedure. Hence, we have to update the streaming 
number to prevent from the lost data which block the 
following data. When the application performs 
handover procedure in order to avoid block with 
previous packet, the base streaming number will 
increase by 3. For instance, streaming number 2 is 
used to transmit video packet. After handover 
procedure, the video packet is transmitted by streaming 
number 5. By this mechanism, the lost packet number 
3 will not block the following data, packet number 4 
and packet number 5, as shown in Fig. 18.

7.1 Experiment Environment 
 
In our experiment environment, there were two 
PCs with Ubuntu 8.04. Both of them were equipped 
with two network interfaces, including wireless 
network interface and wired network card. We 
simulated the network handover by disconnecting 
network. When the application doesn’t receive any 
data within threshold time, it will switch the primary 
address without re-connecting to the partner. 
Fig. 19 depicts four cases of handover 
configuration in the experimental environment.

Unlike the reliable transmission of TCP or 
unreliable transmission of UDP, SCTP provides the 
option for the designer to setup the TTL (Time to live) 
for each packet. The retransmit mechanism of PR-
SCTP is the same as SCTP. When the TTL is expired, 
the sender will send forward TSN chunk, whose new 
cumulative TSN value informs the receiver not to wait 
for the packet for real-time transmission service. In 
addition, the application based on TCP or UDP 
protocol can only choose one network interface when 
the PC has multi-network interface. If the default 
network interface failed, the application program can’t 
change the interface to other available interface, which 
makes the transmission broken. SCTP provides the 
multi-homing for the endpoint to use multi-network 
interface at the same time. One of interfaces is the 
primary address, the others are the backup addresses. 
Consequently, we can utilize the Dynamic IP Address 
Reconfiguration; it can add/delete IP or changes the 
primary address without disconnect the connection. 
The feature is very suitable for mobile device since the 
mobile device always travels in the multi-networks. 
In order to provide stable application, we use the 
multi-homing to development the video/audio 
application. When the primary path disconnect, the 
application will switch to secondary path without 
disconnecting the communication. Using multi-
streaming feature, the application transmits the 
different type packet through independent channels to 
avoid head-of-line blocking problem. When some data 
loss, the retransmission will not affect transmission of 
the other type packets. To overcome the long delay 
caused by congestion control mechanism, we should 
adopt appropriate partial reliability scheme, such as 
timed reliability scheme, to effectively exploit the 
narrower bandwidth for more significant data. This 
objective of this study is to enhance IHU project based 
on TCP to be a new approach that is a SCTP-IHWU 
model. It realizes real-time streaming multimedia in 
parallel for voice/video over IP as well as implements 
seamless handover between wired and wireless 
networks successfully.

Abstract—A fast warning response to an impending crash 
based on vision/GPS sensing together with v2v 
communication has been realized to achieve line marking 
recognition, neighboring vehicles detection, and headway 
estimation, where a distributed embedded dual-platform 
DaVinci+XScale-NAV270 was built to improve system 
effectiveness as well as a data fusion QT-BPNN/ANFIS 
was applied to dissolving the heterogeneous data. GPS 
information for each car was exchanged and 
disseminated each other via dedicated short range 
communication (DSRC). It performs at the least response 
time 0.5972 seconds and gets reduced accident rate about 
70~82%, superior to two alternative collision warning 
systems.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Vision difference or inattention to the traffic 
condition often causes the unnecessary traffic 
accidents while driving. In this study we will establish 
a system for a rapid detection of the neighboring 
vehicles, a fast recognition of the lane marking, and a 
quick estimation of the headway between neighboring 
cars that improves the long-standing traffic problems 
such as road traffic monitoring and vehicle location 
and so on. Besides distance, angle, and velocity we 
concerned, the in-vehicle hazardous driving detection, 
involving fatigue level (FL), carbon monoxide 
concentration (COC), and blood/breath alcohol 
concentration (BAC), has also considered and through 
a quantum-tuned back-propagation neural network 
(QT-BPNN) [1] to derive the extra reaction time. 
Moreover, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference 
system (ANFIS) [2] together with motor vehicle event 
data record (MVEDR) [3] realizes a collision warning 
system (CWS) for which GPS information for each car 
was disseminated each other via dedicated short range 
communication (DSRC). 
II. VISION/GPS METHOD 
A. Lane Marking Recognition 
The article (Jeong et al, 2001) [4] pointed out that 
region of interest (ROI) can be set in a screen, and the 
size of ROI in front of the car requires just broader 
than the width of a land we drive as shown in Fig. 1, 
After ROI is set, the system will apply the continuity 
of lane marking in Eq. (1) to construct a complete 
image of the lane within the scope of the ROI. The 
information relevant to lane marking may not contain 
in ROI for a single visual image captured from CCD. 
If so, the information will not come out in ROI as 
shown in Fig. 2 where the image is at the time instant 
(t-2). Thus, system takes three succeeding images to 
complete the continuity of lane marking: 
 )t(L)t(H)t(D j,ij,ij,i   (1) 
 ))t(B),t(G),t(Rmax()t(H hj,ihj,ihj,ij,i   (2) 
 ))t(B),t(G),t(Rmax()t(L l j,il j,il j,ij,i   (3) 
where i and j stand for the coordinates of the location 
of the image, (R, G, B) represents RGB color pixels. 
)t(Rh ǵ )t(Gh ǵ )t(Bh  as well as )t(Rl ǵ )t(Gl ǵ )t(Bl  are 
corresponding to the maximum and minimum intensity 
for each pixel with RGB color for three succeeding 
images at the time instant t, t-1, t-2. )t(H j,i  and )t(L j,i  are 
referred to as High-Color image and Low-Color image, 
respectively, and denotes as the maximum and the 
minimum intensity for each pixel with the three 
primary colors RGB. Finally, the subtraction of High-
Color image and Low-Color image resulted in )t(D j,i , 
for which we can clearly identify images in the ROI 
and extract the lane marking from the road surface. 
B. Neighboring Vehicles Detection 
In order to speedup the analysis and increase the 
accuracy of positioning coordinates, the system only 
takes care of the road surfaces at the lane we drive and 
the adjacent lanes on both sides of the host vehicle. We

 III. COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM (CWS) 
A distributed embedded dual-platform is built with 
DaVinci+XScale-NAV270 [7] as shown in Fig. 7 
served as a digital automobile console. 
A. Sensing Stage 
The visual images are captured very fast by several 
CCD cameras outside of the car and analyzed to 
detects both lane marking and nearby vehicles [8] [9] 
in each image and then output the relevant data like 
distance, velocity, and angle between the host and 
other vehicles using Goldbeck algorithm [8] [9]. 
Vehicle state sensors detect several categories of data 
such as vehicle velocity, tire pressure, and engine 
temperature, etc. Moreover, the fatigue level (FL), the 
concentration of carbon monoxide (COC), and breath 
alcohol concentration (BAC) are measured in the hsot 
vehicle to evaluate the extra reaction time. On-board 
global positioning system (GPS) receives latitude, 
longitude, and elevation and then disseminates these 
information to all of neighboring vehicles one another 
via mobile wireless communication DSRC. Data are 
also stored into MVEDR. 
B. Data Fusion (Prediction) Stage 
Let host vehicle (HV) be the vehicle we drove and 
other vehicle (OV) the vehicle drove near us. 
D : OV distance measured from radar sensor. 
A : OV angle measured from radar sensor. 
RV : OV relative velocity calculated from radar sensor. 
HV : HV velocity measured from vehicle state sensor. 
W : HV’s width a stable variable. 
A regular warning distance WARND has been taken 
into consideration in Eq. (19) which is derived from 
NHTSA algorithm [10] [11].

where osT and hsT are the time for the OV and HV to 
stop, 2max /5.5 smah   is the maximum deceleration that 
HV is assumed to take, 5.1 W  second is driver reaction 
time, ha and oa are the current acceleration rate of HV 
and OV, respectively, and dv  is the relative speed 
between OV and HV. 
 Horizontal distance between HV and OV: 
  ADDHOR sinu  (20) 
 Vertical distance between HV and  OV: 
  ADDVER cosu  (21) 
Five outputs are given below: 
 OV angle:  A  
 OV velocity:

As shown in Fig. 8, The predict stage is 
constructed by ANFIS system involving five input 
variable A , oV , OHV  , HORWIND   and VERWARND   where the 
learning process in ANFIS is with a back-propagation 
error plus a least mean squared error [12]. Eventually, 
a warning level goes to “warning stage”. 
C. Warning Stage 
Four kinds of collision situations as shown in Fig. 
9 are explored in this study and explained as below: 
(a) Forward Collision Warning (FCW):  
Forward collision warning with 4 warning levels 
[13] arises when the lead vehicle is stopped, 
slowing, or traveling at a constant speed. 
(b) Blind Spots Warning (BSW):  
Blind spot warning with 3 warning levels alerts 
drivers that an automobile approaches within the 
area of blind spot on either the right-hand or left-
hand side of the lane.  
(c) Lane Change Warning (LCCW): 
Lane change collision warning with 2 warning 
levels is deployed to alert the drivers having 
vehicles or other obstructions in adjacent lanes 
when the driver prepares to change lanes. 
(d) Head-On Collision Warning (HOCW): 
Head-on collision warning with 4 warning levels 
alerts drivers an imminent crash with the 
preceding vehicle where both cars drive in the 
same roadway and yet move on the opposite 
direction. 
IV. QUANTUM-TUNED BPNN PREDICTING EXTRA 
REACTION TIME 
Quantum minimization that makes optimization 
task work out associated with probability of success at 
least 1/2 within an unsorted database is realized by 
quantum minimum searching algorithm [14]. A 
quantum exponential searching algorithm [15] is called 
by quantum minimum searching algorithm to be as a 
subroutine to serve a fast database searching engine. 
A three-layer back-propagation neural net (BPNN) 
with a structure of 3×8×1 multilayer-perceptron [1] as 
shown in Fig. 10, is used for predicting the extra 
reaction time derived from FL, COC, and BAC. We 
arrange the input pattern as a normalized fatigue level 
fatiguei
~ , a normalized carbon monoxide concentration coci~ , 
and a normalized blood/breath alcohol concentration 
baci
~ . The output is the extra reaction time ertW  applied to
