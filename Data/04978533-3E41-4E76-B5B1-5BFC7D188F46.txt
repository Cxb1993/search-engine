 本計畫主要整合三子計畫而提出綠色產品推薦系統之雛型。本年計畫中乃由子
計劃一規劃設計資訊系統平台。初步架設於清大總主持人實驗室。系統所需資訊含由第
二子計劃分析提供之消費者的綠色偏好，以及第三子計畫收集分析之綠色產品風險因子
及相對應的綠色規章指標與滿足程度，其次根據產品屬性及消費者的綠色偏好推薦適當
的綠色產品。由於 3C 產品目前為台灣出口之大宗 故本期先針對 EPEAT (Electronic 
Product Environmental Assessment Tool) system 中列出的綠 3C 產品測試建構。初步結果顯
示藉由此推薦機制，我們所提出的綠色推薦系統，不管對於廠商與消費者都可以提供適
合的綠色資訊。 
 
關鍵詞：綠色推薦平台雛型、綠色產銷、綠色風險與偏好 
 
英文摘要 
 This study is to integrate 3 sub-projects into an information retrieval system.  The 
preliminary prototype is set up at the Soft Computing & Fuzzy Optimization Lab of Tsing Hua 
University, charged by the chief executor. This year, apart from the design and set up this 
prototype by sub-project 1, the content of green products risk and green indexes were provided 
by sub-project 3; whereas the customers’ preference and clustering criteria were provided by 
sub-project 2. Preliminary test has been done by using 3C green products provided by EPEAT 
(Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool).  It has shown that through this 
recommendation mechanism, the proposed green recommender may provide proper 
information of the green products for both the companies and the customers.
