Abstract 
Toys and parent-children interaction are important media in child development, and it is also 
essential for the child with autism who has difficulties in interaction behaviors. This research is 
focused on toys design for promoting better interactions and emotions based on the sensory 
integrations for families their child with autism, there are two steps as follows. (1) The design 
elements for multiple toys are collected and discussed. (2) The interactions experiment of 
parent-children with autism is held by multiple toys with sensory-added stimulus that are including 
the proprioception, tactile, vision, auditory and olfactory. For promoting the better emotions, the 
results of the “smile-and-laughter behavior”, “eyes-contact behavior” are discussed in the 
interactions of parent-children with autism. It is found that sensory-adding could keep a certain 
level of good interaction, but could not piling up the times of Smile-and-laughter and eyes contacts 
from the child with Autism. Consequently, multiple toys could promote a certain interactions and 
emotions based on the sensory integrations for families their child with autism.

The toys must be flexibly designed so that 
users can choose favorite ones, and the solution 
to it is having multiple forms [11]. In this 
research, the toys should be piled by sensory 
integrations. Therefore, the order for the 
sensory-added stimulus is inquired. By the 
questionnaires, the occupational therapists are 
inquired for figure out the importance and order 
of sensory stimulus that given to children with 
autism. The weights of 5 sensory stimulus were 
analyzed by AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) 
method.  The order (Fig. 6) is as follows:

experiments. One had to direct the game with 
using multiple toys, and the other had to be in 
charge of observing their objective interactions 
inclusive of the “smile-and-laughter behaviors” 
and “eyes-contact behaviors” during the 
experimental processes. Members during the 
experiments were as follows: 
(1) Children A with low-functioning autism, 
Male, 7 years and 6 months old, mother as 
guide and father as an observer. 
(2) Children B with high-functioning autism, 
Male, 6 years and 2 months old, father as 
guide and mother as an observer. 
(3) Children C with high-functioning autism, 
Male, 5 years and 7 months old, father as 
guide and mother as an observer. 
(4) Children D with high-functioning autism, 
Male, 5 years and 6 months old, father as 
guide and mother as an observer. 
(6) Children E with high-functioning autism, 
Male, 8 years and 11 months old, mother as 
guide and father as an observer. 
 
3.2 Procedure 
The research is focused on toys design with 
sensory-added stimulus integrations by multiple 
toys between parents and their child with autism. 
For promoting the better emotions, the results of 
the “smile-and-laughter behavior”, 
“eyes-contact behavior” are observed and 
discussed in the interactions of them. 
The experiments were taken by five 
families and each family has to take five trials. 
And each round trial takes about 20 to 30 
minutes during five days with multiple toys.  
Experiments are planned in some specific ways 
(Table 1) while playing, there are “touching, 
rolling, turning, holding, lifting, catching,  
shooting and patting the ball”.  
Table 1 Program for experiments

5. Discussion and Conclusion 
(1) Individual diverseness 
From the result of sensory-added toys 
experiments, it is found that sensory-added toys 
could keep a certain level of good interaction 
with their parents by the index of 
Smile-and-laughter and Eyes-contact. But the 
individual diverseness among children with 
autism is quite clear by the mean and their 
variance. 
(2) Sensory-added stimulus and their 
Interactions 
Comparing smile-and-laughter and 
eyes-contact, it could be found that the times of 
smile-and-laughter and eyes-contact is 
descendant while the tactile stimulus added. 
And both smile-and-laughter and eyes-contact 
are ascendant while visual stimulus added. 
While auditory stimulus added, the score of 
smile-and-laughter, eyes-contact is descendant.  
It is found that sensory-adding could keep 
a certain level of good interaction, but could not 
piling up the times of Smile-and-laughter and 
eyes contacts from the child with Autism. 
Consequently, multiple toys could promote a 
certain interactions and emotions based on the 
sensory integrations for families their child with 
autism.

1  INTRODUCTION 
Autism is a developmental disorder that exits 
about 5 to 15 in every 10,000 people. All 
individuals diagnosed with autism are 
characterized by severe and pervasive impairment 
in social interaction and communication. 
Repetitive play and limited social skills are 
generally evident. Unusual responses to sensory 
information, like noises and lights, are also 
common[1][2]. Lots of remains show that 
physical tools through the process of therapy, 
such as the method based on the sensory 
integration, improve the children’s 
communications and behaviors. 
Dr. Ayres A.J. (1979) emphasized that the basic 
learning abilities of children are gradually 
developed from the process of sensory integration, 
and she thought that the systems of sensory inputs 
are the nutrition for their brains [3]. Therefore, we 
discussed on the physical tools regarding to 
multiple toys.     
Toys are important to the childhood and also 
essential for the children with autism [4][5]. This 
research is aimed at promoting better interactions 
and emotions between parents and their child with 
autism. The behaviors of “Smile-and-laughter ” 
and “eyes-contact” are mainly discovered from 
the experiments by using multiple toys with 
sensory-added stimulus that are including 
proprioception, tactile, vision, auditory and 
olfactory [6]. The former interaction is focused on 
show-up joyful feelings from inner experience; 
the latter one is a non-speaking communication 
between parents and children. 
2 MULTIPLE TOYS 
Before experimenting on a potential design of 
multiple toys, we considered the physical features 
and the order to fabricate them [7]. Considering 
sensory-adding for multiple toys, the physical 
features are collected from the field. First, the 
elements which could be sensory-added stimulus 
of the toy are discussed. Second, the order is 
clarified to fabricate multiple toys for the 
experiment. 
2.1 Physical features with specific 
sensory-added stimulus 
As for making the prototypical sensory stimulus 
for designing multiple toys, we tried to find out 
the physical features by questionnaires. There are 
adults who has child with autism under 
occupational therapy are inquired by 
questionnaires in order to catch the children’s 
preference and acceptable from the field.  
Following figures are the results from 
questionnaires by Descriptive Statistics Analysis, 
there are the physical features with sensory 
stimulus from proprioception, tactile, vision, 
auditory and olfactory [8][9][10]. Features below 
were considered to develop multiple toys: 
(1) The proprioception: Object should be 
weighed as 300g.  
(2) The tactile: Soft, gibbous and 
granulous (Fig. 1).

(5)  Trial 5: The ball with red surface and 
Styrofoam inside, weighed in 300g, felt soft, 
gibbous and granulous, with LED displays, 
small bells as maracas and small bags with 
aroma as the sensory-added stimulus of 
olfactory 
Multiple toys could be self-assembly with 
sensory-added stimulus including proprioception, 
tactile, vision, auditory and olfactory. 
3  EXPERIMENTS 
Experiments were held by the multiple toys used 
in five-trials with five families, and the research 
was trying to figure out toys that affect 
interactions for parent-children with autism and 
smile-and-laughter and eyes-contact behavior are 
observed. 
3.1 Testee 
All children in the group with autism had been 
diagnosed by clinicians according to criteria such 
as those specified in DSM-IV. Parents were as a 
guide and an observer on the experiments. One 
had to direct the game with using multiple toys, 
and the other had to be in charge of observing 
their objective interactions inclusive of the 
“smile-and-laughter behaviors” and “eyes-contact 
behaviors” during the experimental processes. 
Members during the experiments were as follows: 
(1) Children A with low-functioning autism, 
Male, 7 years and 6 months old, mother as 
guide and father as an observer. 
(2) Children B with high-functioning autism, 
Male, 6 years and 2 months old, father as 
guide and mother as an observer. 
(3) Children C with high-functioning autism, 
Male, 5 years and 7 months old, father as 
guide and mother as an observer. 
(4) Children D with high-functioning autism, 
Male, 5 years and 6 months old, father as 
guide and mother as an observer. 
(5) Children E with high-functioning autism, 
Male, 8 years and 11 months old, mother as 
guide and father as an observer. 
3.2 Procedure 
The research is focused on toys design with 
sensory-added stimulus integrations by multiple 
toys between parents and their child with autism. 
For promoting the better emotions, the results of 
the “smile-and-laughter behavior”, “eyes-contact 
behavior” are observed and discussed in the 
interactions of them. 
The experiments were taken by five families (see 
3.1) and each family has to take five trials (see 
2.3). And each round trial takes about 20 to 30 
minutes during five days with multiple toys.  
Experiments are planned in some specific ways 
while playing, there are “touching, rolling, patting, 
holding, throwing, picking up, and shooting the 
ball”.

Figure 7 is examples of the experiment, children 
were taking the specific motions with multiple 
toys. These movements are also helpful for 
children’s action ability.  
4  ANALYSIS 
By descriptive statistics (Table 1), 5 samples were 
analyzed. The mean and sample standard 
deviation showed the variance of each test. And 
ANOVA was analyzed for discussing the 
relations and differences among 5 trials.
