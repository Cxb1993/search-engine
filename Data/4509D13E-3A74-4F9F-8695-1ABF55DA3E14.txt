at the interface or continuously varied over a 
distance near the interface. In general, the 
interface itself is not tracked in this approach. In 
the front tracking approach, the phase front needs 
to be continuously captured. As for the moving 
particle method [19, 31], the Stefan condition is 
considered as a means to track the moving front, 
see the Appendix of Part II [57]. A large number 
of Lagrangian points coincident with the 
nominated moving particles is needed to track 
the front. Consequently, an accurate interpolation 
of the liquid/solid moving interface can become 
computationally very expensive. Moreover, as 
the moving front proceeds, the number of 
moving particles will be increased significantly 
to retain the predication accuracy. While this 
method can be applicable to simulate the two 
dimensional dendritic solidification [22, 24, 31, 
44, 47, 48, 50], the computational effort will be 
considerable when dealing with the three 
dimensional problems. Other techniques applied 
to the simulation of dendritic solidification are 
known as the Lattice Boltzmann model [32, 45] 
and the phase field model [43]. 
The presently advocated mushy cell tracking 
algorithm can be implemented in both 2D and 
3D cases. During solidification, new mushy cells 
are determined by examining the newly 
solidified neighboring mushy cells. Once this 
type of mushy cells is labeled, the mushy cell 
tracking equation can be used to explicitly 
evaluate the required time increment. This is 
accomplished by choosing a mushy cell, which is 
the first to be solidified and is then used to 
update the volume-averaged   for all mushy 
cells. Comparing with the moving particles 
method, this mushy cell approach can 
significantly reduce the computational time in 
searching and interpolating. The computational 
mushy resembles the moving particle but is not 
exactly the same. The moving particles method 
tracks the moving front along its normal 
direction while the mushy cell tracking algorithm 
is developed by way of the cell tracking equation 
with a view to finding the minimum time step. 
Another approach involving the body-fitted 
coordinates [7, 52] was also shown to be 
successful in maintaining a sharp resolution of 
the interface. This mapping method can 
transform the deformed physical domain into a 
regular, fixed-grid computational domain. In 
theory, this method is effective to truly track the 
interface. In practice, the change between the 
original and transformed coordinate systems 
performed at each time step could, however, 
make the analysis an extremely expensive task. 
Moreover, only for the problems with geometries 
that do not lead to singular mapping could be 
solved by this method. 
The VOF method was originally proposed by 
Hirt and Nichols [4], who used the 
donor-acceptor concept to capture the moving 
free surface of a liquid, and has since been the 
subject of much development [18, 27, 37, 42]. 
When implementing the VOF method, it is 
necessary to minimize the smearing of a 
time-varying volume fraction function. While the 
minimization procedure, known as the VOF 
reconstruction, takes a considerable time, 
uncertainty still remains to capture the exact 
moving interface. 
The level set method [24, 40, 55] is a more 
recently developed approach for resolving the 
interface. In this method, the moving front is 
determined by solving the partial differential 
equations for the distance function. The 
re-initialization procedure is also needed in the 
reconstruction of the set values for the distance 
function. Near the moving interface, a 
sign-function is applied and the resulting 
interface has an artificial finite thickness. 
When applying the front tracking method to 
simulate the liquid solidification, the simulated 
solutions should satisfy the mass, momentum, 
energy, and, perhaps, species conservations 
principles. In the current study, the energy 
balance equation is used to govern the movement 
of the interface. With the consideration of energy 
balance around the mushy-cell, the mushy cell 
tracking equation can be derived in the control 
volume form and can, therefore, be served to 
track the movement of mushy-cell. The current 
algorithm uses the integral form of the 
conservation equation. Specification of a 
constant melting or freezing temperature at the 
center of the mushy cells can lead to a direct 
evaluation of the boundary conditions at the 
interface between the mushy, solid and liquid 
cells, thereby facilitating the interface capturing. 
The moving front region is defined by a single 
control cell. This means that the interface can be 
reduced to a curved surface when the cell volume 
is reduced to zero. However, in the 
enthalpy-based method, the region will occupy a 
finite space even at this limiting condition. 
In the present study, the cell-by-cell thermally 
driven tracking method will be applied to trace 
the mushy cells instead of tracing the interface 
line segment or the front face. To distinguish the 
distinct characteristics of the mushy cell tracking 
 4 
thermal expansion coefficient Tb . In Eq. (1), 
U  is the fluid velocity and P  is the pressure. 
When simulating phase-change problems without 
involving heat convection, the equation for the 
thermal energy can be reduced to the one similar 
to the heat conduction equation. To account for 
the movement of a mushy cell, energy balance at 
the mushy cell interface needs to be taken into 
account. When the moving particles method is 
used to trace the moving front, in the  
solidification process following Stefan condition 
should be enforced at the solid/liquid interface 
[2], 
( )D · = Ñ · - Ñ ·H W n k T n k T ns s s L Lr  (4) 
In the above equation, HD  denotes the latent 
heat of solidification and n  is the outward 
normal vector of the moving front. Ñ ·T nL  and 
Ñ ·T ns  denote the normal derivatives of T  in 
the liquid region and the solid region, 
respectively. W  is the velocity at the moving 
front. Instead of using the Stefan condition based 
moving particles method, the proposed mushy 
cell tracking approach is adopted, however, both 
of the computational time and memory can be 
significantly reduced. 
 
2.1 Derivation of mushy cell tracking equation 
Within the non-moving context, the equations for 
the mass and energy given below in a control

In the above equation, W  is equal to zero in 
the fixed control volume mW  and q  
represents the heat flux due to thermal 
conduction. The following assumptions will be 
made for the approximation of the above two 
equations: (a) there is no fluid flow between the 
mushy cells. Actually, the mushy cell is treated 
as a porous medium with a very high resistance 
to the flow, (b) there is no temperature gradient 
across the interface between two mushy cells 
because the temperature of each mushy cell is 
specified as Tm . Take the mushy cell shown in 
Fig. 2 as an example, the above mass and energy 
equations can be approximated as

In the above equations, AmL  is the outward 
normal vector from the cell mW  and is directed 
towards the neighboring liquid phase cell. The 
associated enthalpy HmL  will be evaluated at 
the cell interface shown in Fig. 2. U mL  is the 
convective velocity between the mushy and 
liquid cells. The volume-averaged solid fraction 
F m  is defined below

It is noted that

Thus, Eq. (7) can be written as

. (10) 
It is also worth noting that Eq. (10) is, in essence, 
the constraint prescribed at the interface of the 
mushy and liquid cells. The velocity at each 
interface is initially set to be the averaged 
velocity magnitudes of the two adjacent cells. It 
is then uniformly corrected by an appropriate 
scaling amount such that the net mass flow rate 
due to velocity correction becomes exactly equal 
to the right-hand side of Eq. (10). The interface 
velocity thus obtained will be served as the 
boundary condition for the flow simulation in the 
liquid region. If two adjacent phases have the 
same density, the right hand-side of Eq. (10) 
becomes, however, zero. In the present study, the 
remedy for this particular condition is to simply 
set the interface velocity as the averaged velocity 
of two adjacent cells. 
Derivation of the mushy cell tracking equation 
will be completed by adding one condition in 
association with the enthalpy of solid or liquid 
into the formulation,

At face f , T f
Ñ  and T f  are both taken to 
be the averaged quantities of the adjacent cells. 
There are several methods detailed in [26, 28, 35, 
41] can be employed to approximate the 
temperature gradients. In the present study, a 
cell-center gradient reconstruction method is 
adopted due to its simplicity and minimal 
computational effort [26]. The face vector A f  
is directed outward and is orthogonal to face f  
for 0W  and 01  is the distance vector 
measured from the cell center of 0W  to the 
center of 1W , which is the neighboring cell of 
0W  shown in Fig. 3. The first term in Eq. (21) 
is of first order accuracy type and the second 
term can be considered as its hyper-order 
(super-liner) correction. The following linear 
system of equations for T  can be derived from 
Eq. (21) at the cell center for the fluid considered 
at rest,

Here, the summation is carried over all the 
neighbors “nb ” of 0W . The source term S0  
contains the super-linear term, such as the 
secondary diffusion fluxes in Eq. (21). When 
solving Eq. (22), the interface temperature of the 
mushy and liquid and solid cells is specified by 
the constant melting or freezing temperature, 
respectively. The boundary diffusion flux can 
then be treated as that evaluated at an interior 
face using Eq. (21). The flux D2  at a boundary 
schematic in Fig. 3 can be written as

 (23) 
In the above equation, T2  is evaluated at the 
center of the boundary face and 02  is the 
vector measured from the center of the cell 0W  
to the centroid of boundary face. For the case 
with Dirichlet-type boundary conditions, the first 
term in Eq. (23) is treated implicitly and will be 
included in the left hand side of Eq. (22) while 
the second term in Eq. (23) is included in the 
right hand side of Eq. (22). For the case with 
Neumann-type boundary condition, the specified 
flux can be directly incorporated into the control 
volume integration. 
After assembling all the discretized equations 
for the convection, diffusion and source terms, 
the following linear system of equations for F  
can be derived as

Here, 0W  is the volume of 0W . The source 
term S0  contains the volumetric source of F  
and the deferred correction of fF  shown in Eq. 
(19). The boundary flux contributions are 
included in S0  and B0  is the coefficient 
containing the contributions from the convection 
and diffusion fluxes. The superscript “ k ” 
denotes the kth time step. 
Evaluation of the mass flow rate at a cell face 
J f  by algebraic averaging means for field 
variables stored at the cell centers is often prone 
to checker-board pressure modes. To overcome 
this unphysical drawback, a scheme [26, 33, 49]

The heat flux, which is thermally induced 
super-cooling, flowing between the mushy cells 
should be also considered in the solidification 
process. It is noted that the modified freezing 
temperature *Tm  in Eq. (36) is not a constant 
value but rather takes a function of curvature and 
interface moving velocity. The crystal pattern is, 
therefore, highly dependent on the Gaussian 
curvature, interface moving normal velocity, 
simulation geometry and the placement of the 
crystal seed. 
  To account for the interface temperature 
between the computational mushy cell and the 
super-cooling liquid or the crystal, melting or 
freezing temperature can no longer be assumed 
to be constant. To prescribe the boundary 
conditions at the interfaces, the moving control 
volume approach is applied in the one 
dimensional manner, as shown in Fig. 4.

As  is the face normal vector that is consistent 
with the dendrite solidification direction. It is 
noted that the volume-averaged enthalpy H m  
is not only the function of F  but also the 
functions of curvature k  and W en·  due to 
the dendritic solidification. Therefore, the 
enthalpy H m  is no longer a constant. The 
first term in left-hand side of Eq. (39) or Eq. (40) 
is, therefore, not necessary to be equal to zero.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
3.1 Phase-change without nature convection 
Two benchmark tests will be chosen for the 
present code validation. 
 
3.1.1 Solidification of one-region problem 
The first test problem taken from [2, 23, 51] for 
determining the solid-liquid interface, schmetic 
in Fig. 5, in the orthogonal and quadrilateral 
elements with 100 10´ , 200 20´  and 
300 30´  mesh points. The numerical simulation 
is performed under the conditions of 
1s Lr r= = , k k 1s L= = , and 
C C 1s L= = . The latent heat HD  is used 
to adjust the Stefan number St  which is 
defined as ( ) ( )St = 1 H C T -Ts f surfD . 
Initially, the domain is maintained at the liquid 
phase with the freezing (or melting) temperature 
set at T 0f = . The wall temperature at x 0=  
is kept to have a constant value of T 1surf = - . 
The resulting exact moving front can be 
expressed as S( t ) th=  [51]. 
Simulations were performed at the Stefan 
numbers of 0.1 , 2.85  and 5 , which result in 
the respective values of 0.4400h = , 1.7985  
and 2.1194 . The predicted S( t )  at the Stefan 
number 2.85  is shown in Fig. 6. The 
discrepancy between the numerical and 
analytical results, defined as 
S( t ) S( t )num analytice º - , is shown in Fig. 7. 
Clearly, the numerical and analytical solutions 
are too close to be distinguished. The order of the 
predicted accuracy is determined by virtue of 
( ) nC t he » , in which h  is defined as a 
characteristic length of a cell. Figure 8 shows 
that n  has a value very close to 1, which can be 
also observed from Table 1. In other words, the 
error of the moving interface location obtained 
from the cell-by-cell thermally driven mushy cell 
tracking is bounded by ( )O he » . The 
simulation results obtained from different Stefan 
numbers are summarized in Table 1. 
 
3.1.2 Melting of pure aluminum 
We then consider the melting problem [51] to 
validate the capability of tracking the 
three-dimensional circular-shaped interface. The 
domain and boundary conditions for this problem 
are shown on Fig. 9 and by Eq. (53), 
respectively.

. (53) 
In Eq. (53), r  is the radial distance from the 
center of the domain which is initially kept at the 
melting temperature, i.e. T Ti m= . Along the 
centerline, the uniformly prescribed heat source 
Q  can cause the melting to propagate outward 
from the centerline. The resulting melting front 
S( t )  can be derived as 
S( t ) 4 t tL sa x h= =  (54) 
The unit of t  is second and sx  is obtained 
from the following equation 
Q se ( H ) 0L L s4
x a r D x
p
- - =  (55) 
Q , Lr  and La  are the line heat source, the 
density, and the thermal diffusivity for the liquid 
phase, respectively. The latent heat HD  is 
known to have an association with the phase 
change. Numerical simulations are performed at 
the physical properties tabulated in Table 2 for a 
pure aluminum. For the case with the line heat 
source of Q 2000 w / cm= , the associated value 
of sx  is 0.3301  and the corresponding value 
h  shown in Eq. (54) is 0.652 . It is noted that 
the specified boundary condition, given in Eq. 
(53), at the center of the domain can result in a 
singular heat flux at the geometrical center in the 
sense that ( k T )r 0Ñ ® ¥® . To circumvent 
the difficulty, the geometry is modified by 
introducing a very small hollow circle with the 
radius of rs , which is measured from the 
geometrical center. The constant heat source is 
then represented by the constant heat flux, 
 12 
time step can not be allowed to exceed a cell 
length. The initial conditions for the uniformly 
under-cooled melt are given below: 
T( x,0 ) St inthe liquid
T( x,0 ) 0 in the solid
=
=
 (56) 
In this fourfold crystal growth case, the 
computations are performed in a 4 4´  square 
domain. The initial interface takes a fourfold 
symmetric shape. The seed under investigation is 
placed at the center of the domain with a radius 
given by 
( )R 0.1 0.02cos 4q= +  (57) 
This represents the circle with a small fourfold 
symmetric perturbation on its surface. The melt 
is considered at the under-cool condition and the 
Stefan number is chosen as St 0.5= - . The 
surface tension is set at 0.002s =  and the 
kinetic parameter is specified as 0.002m = . The 
interfacial parameters are isotropic. The results 
obtained in the 301 301´  mesh are plotted in 
Fig. 22. The initial seed was seen to be oriented 
at °45  from the horizontal and the result 
shown in Fig. 23 is different from the results 
shown in Fig. 22. By setting 0.00145m = , we 
can have the pattern shown in Fig. 24. The 
difference is caused by the initial seed 
orientation and temperature gradient established 
near the interface. It is no doubt that the effective 
interface temperature will be changed by the 
local moving velocity. In addition, the curvature 
will be also affected by this moving velocity. 
For a better predication, simulation is 
performed in the domain with orthogonal grids. 
Six sets of data, namely, (a) K 1.0, K 0.1s L= = , 
(b) K 1.0, K 0.2s L= = , (c) K 1.0, K 0.5s L= = , 
(d) 0.2K,0.1K Ls == , 
(e) K 1.0, K 5.0s L= = , (f) K 0.2, K 1.0s L= =  
are considered. Note that all the calculations are 
performed at 
0.002, 0.002, A 0.0, A 0.0, and m 4s ks m= = = = =
. The other related parameters, such as r  and 
CP , are fixed with the magnitude of one for 
convenience. For the fourfold dendritic 
solidification, the pattern is changed significantly 
according to Fig. 25. By increasing the value of 
KL  from 0.1 to 0.2, the unstable solidification 
pattern is seen to change from the “quasi-circle” 
or “fat”, shown in Fig. 25(a), to a pattern 
featured with the small tips in Fig. 25(b). To 
account for the phenomenon, we do need to 
understand the effect of the curvature and the 
outward normal velocity of the moving front. 
The role of the curvature is to make the front 
pattern to be configured as a circle. However, the 
outward normal velocity will be deviated from 
the circle and result in a preferred anisotropic 
pattern. Accordingly, the outward normal 
velocity is reduced by decreasing the value 
of KL . Under this situation, the dendrite growth 
will be gradually evolved to show a circular 
pattern (see Fig. 25 (a)) due to the curvature 
effect. However, the value of KL  is increased 
with an amount greater than 1 , the tips shown in 
Fig. 27 and in Fig. 25(c) will be reduced and 
disappeared finally. This result is plotted in Fig. 
25(d) for the illustrative purpose due to the 
increasingly important normal velocity. For 
K 1s =  and K 2L < , both the effects of 
curvature and normal velocity are important as 
shown in Figs. 25(b) and 25(c). Instead of the 
concave tips, the convex tips will be clearly seen 
by further increasing the value of KL  to 5 , 
for example. The result can be seen in Fig. 25(e) 
and can be explained from Eq. (52) for larger 
values of Ks  and KL . Thus, the volume 
averaged normal velocity is large and can cause 
the deviation from the circle to occur very 
rapidly. If K 1L =  is given and K 1.0s =  is 
reduced to K 0.2s = , the result shown in Fig. 
25(f) is found to be similar to that shown in Fig. 
22. The curvature and normal velocity effects are 
both important and will be competed with each 
other. It is also noted possibly that the results 
shown in [21] are similar to our results with the 
predicted discrepancies attributed to the initial 
placement of seeds. Some errors may be 
introduced due to the imposed moving-interface 
boundary condition. In addition, several 
adjustments are made to compare our simulated 
results shown in Fig. 26 with the result of Shyy 
et al [31]. It is found that the predicted 
discrepancy is small but it indeed exists. For the 
five-fold, six-fold and eight-fold seeds, the 
predicted dendritic solidification results are 
illustrated in Fig. 27 for the reader’s reference. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS

0W  is one of the fixed control volumes 
encountered in the phase-change process. It is 
noted that F denotes the local property and 
F 0  represents the volume-averaged property 
for this fixed control volume. In general, the 
value of F 0Ñ  is not necessarily equal to the 
value of F 0Ñ . Instead, these two values can 
approach each other only when the control 
volume approaches to zero. Thanks to this 
assumption, the following equation can be 
derived with the help of Eq. (A4)
