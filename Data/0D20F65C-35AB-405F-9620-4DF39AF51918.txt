The modified fuzzy system (4) has been used to 
model the behaviors of nonlinear and time-varying

well-defined. The assumption is easily satisfied by 
the functions commonly used to define 
membership functions, such as triangular, 
trapezoidal, Gaussian, and generalized bell 
functions. When there is discontinuity at the 
membership function derivatives, such as the tip of 
a triangular membership function, the value of the 
discontinuous point is defined as the mean value of 
its left and right neighbors.

This relationship corresponds to the fact that any 
variable can be represented as linear interpolation 
of its two extremes. A detailed illustration can be 
found in the appendix of [10].

One of the design purposes of this paper is then

stabilize the modified fuzzy system (25) such that 
the H∞ tracking performance (28) is guaranteed. In 
the design procedure, we also manage to minimize 
the attenuation level, , so that the performance is 
optimized.

In this section, we present sufficient conditions 
that guarantee the H∞ tracking control performance, 
defined in (28), of the closed-loop system (27). 
These conditions are represented in a theorem,

their universal function approximation property and representation theory, stability analysis and 
controller design. Perspectives of model based fuzzy control in future were also discussed.

Sugeno早己是教科書上的經典人物，而 Kazuo Tanaka則是近年非常活躍的日本大師。值得注
意的是 Kazuo Tanaka最近提出的 a sum of squares (SOS) approach，用於 polynomial fuzzy 
systems 的穩定性分析，這種做法視 quadratic Lyapunov functions為其特殊狀況，因此可獲得
較不保守的解。 
晚宴時坐在來自土耳其 Erciyes University的M. Emin Yuksel教授旁，他的論文 “A 
Detail-Preserving Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Filter for Impulse Noise Removal from Digital Images” 已
在週二宣讀，無緣聆聽，但也趁機多了解了 Type-2 Fuzzy Logic的重要性，知道它是近十年的
重要發展，用以處理不可預測，non-stationary 的前置項。

A fuzzily blended time-varying canonical model is 
used to represent the nonlinear plant, with each rule 
represented by: 
z Plant rule i  ( ) : Li ,...,2,1=
     IF          is  and L  and ( )tz1 1iM ( )tz p  is 
            ipM
THEN    iiin vubtxax +⋅++⋅= )(δ&             
      (3) 
In each rule, , ,…, and  are the  
premise variables, which can be state variables or 
functions of state variables,  is the fuzzy set 
corresponding to the j-th premise variable, is the i-th 
system parameter, 
( )tz1 ( )tz2 ( )tz p p

ia
)(tδ  is a time-varying term, usually 
written in a Fourier sine or cosine series expansion 
form with finite length, and denotes the i-th control 
input parameter. Note that, in the representation,  is 
the i-th bias which is the so-called “affine term” in the 
T-S fuzzy model, and L is the number of the IF-THEN 
rules.

The nonlinear and time-varying plant is then

Fig. 1 shows the Gaussian membership functions, A1, 
A2, and A3, for the premise parts of the fuzzy model. 
Note that, the membership functions are not 
normalized. The identification is achieved by genetic 
algorithms using input/output batch data collected 
when the plant is excited by white noise with 
magnitudes between [-15, 15].

constraint, defined in (15), as , the parameter 
vector constraint, defined in (24), as , and the 
upper bounds of

200=θM
mode  used in (6), as . Then, 
we chose , , and solved for the

The initial PID control gains are selected as ,

the plant and the reference input when a PID controller

Fig. 3 shows the state trajectories of the plant and 
the reference input when both the adaptive PID control 
law, described by (8) and (24), and the supervisory 
controller, based on (19), are applied. The time history 
of the PID gains under adaptation is depicted in Fig. 4. 
Comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, it is clear that the 
tracking performance of the supervised adaptive 
controller significantly outperform that of a constant 
gain PID controller in facing the disturbance.
