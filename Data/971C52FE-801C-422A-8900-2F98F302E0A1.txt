容量的限制，且每個非轉運點最多僅能與數個轉運點相連結。
轉運網絡由所有 n 個互動的節點(node)所構成，其中有 p 個會被設為轉運點(hub)(p 為
決策的一部份)。轉運點間完全相互連結，在網絡中擔任集中、轉運的角色，非轉運點(non-hub)
必須經由連結轉運點來相互連結。為獲得轉運網絡的效益，必須妥善設計轉運網絡的運作，
使轉運網絡的總成本達到最小化，此總成本包括：(1)起點至轉運點(origin-hub)的收集成本；
(2)轉運點間(inter hub)的運輸成本；(3)轉運點至終點(hub-destination)的配送成本；以及(4)
轉運點的建置成本。在 97 年度的計畫，我們考量轉運點有個別的單一容量限制；在 98 年

11. Introduction
In many transportation and telecommunication networks, connecting all pairs of nodes by
direct links is very costly. Hence, hubs are installed to serve as intermediate switching or
transshipment points. The traffic (such as data transmissions, mail, express packages, cargos, or
airline passengers) from the same origin with different destinations is collected on the allocated
hub(s), where it is regrouped with other traffic from different origins and leaves the hub(s) either
to other hubs or to their final destinations. Hubs, which are chosen among the nodes in the
network, are fully interconnected and direct flow between non-hubs are costly and thus not
allowed. Since hubbing can achieve the advantage of economies of scale, there has been a rapid
growth in the application of hub networks. Typical applications may be found in airline passenger
travel [1-3], express package delivery [4, 5], message delivery [6-8], and cargo delivery [9-11].
There are several variants of hub location problems [12-14]. In the p-hub median problem
(p-HMP), the number of hubs p is given a priori [12]. The objective is to locate the hubs and to
allocate the non-hubs to the hubs such that the total transportation cost is minimized. The total
cost includes (1) the collection cost incurred during the transportation from the non-hubs to their
allocated hubs; (2) the transfer cost incurred during the transportation between hubs; and (3) the
distribution cost incurred during the transportation from the allocated hubs to the non-hubs.
The uncapacitated hub location problem (UHLP) is a different type of hub location problem.
In the UHLP, the number of hubs is not given a priori and a fixed cost for installing a hub is
included in the objective function. The capacitated hub location problem (CHLP) is another type
of hub location problem, in which the capacity constraints are enforced on the hubs and
sometimes on the arcs as well.
Two types of allocation are commonly found in the literature. In the single allocation, each
non-hub is allocated to a single hub. The multiple allocation case allows each non-hub to be
routed to all the hubs. In real world situations, however, the allocation of the non-hubs to the hubs
does not always fall under single allocation or multiple allocation. In many practical situations,
each non-hub is connected to a few hubs, perhaps two or three; the transportation from the
non-hubs to the allocated hubs can remain flexible and consolidated. Furthermore, in order to
provide better service, it is assumed that each origin-destination pair cannot be split. In this
research, we deal with this type of capacitated hub location problems. Hybrid heuristics, based on
the simulated annealing (SA) method [15], tabu lists from the tabu search (TS) [16], and
improvement procedures, are proposed to determine the number of hubs, to properly locate the
hubs, and to determine the path for each origin-destination pair. Computational characteristics of
the proposed heuristics are evaluated through extensive computational experiments using the
revised Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and Australia Post (AP) data sets. Computational
performance of the proposed heuristics is compared with the optimal solutions and random
descent heuristics.
33. Simulated annealing method and tabu lists
The concepts of the simulated annealing (SA) method and the tabu lists from the tabu search
are briefly described in this chapter.
3.1 Simulated annealing method
The SA method was derived from statistical mechanics. Basically, it is a stochastic
hill-climbing search algorithm [42]. It consists of a sequence of iterations, where each iteration
changes the current solution to a new solution in the neighborhood of the current solution. Once a
neighborhood solution is created, the corresponding change in the cost function is computed to
determine whether the neighborhood solution is accepted as the current solution. If the
neighborhood solution results in cost reduction, this solution is directly taken as the current
solution. Otherwise, it is accepted according to Metropolis’s criterion [15]. According to
Metropolis’s criterion, the neighborhood solution is accepted as the curent solution if r ≤ 
exp(-ΔE/T), in which r is generated from U[0, 1], ΔE is the difference between the costs of the
two solutions, and T is the current temperature. Three parameters need to be specified when
applying SA: the initial temperature; the temperature cooling rate; and the number of iterations to
be performed at each temperature stage (i.e., the Markov chain length).
3.2 Tabu lists
Since moves not results in improvements may be accepted in SA, it is possible to return to
already obtained solutions. Hence, a tabu list from the tabu search [16] is used to overcome this
dilemma. This tabu list store attributes that identify specific moves as tabu in the later search,
such that the moves leading to previously obtained solutions can be avoided. Theoretically, the
tabu list must store all previously obtained solutions; this will require too much memory and
computational effort. Alternatively, it can store only the moves during the last s iterations (s is
defined as the tabu size). By giving an appropriate tabu size, the tabu list may effectively prevent
obtaining cycling solutions. In this research, tabu lists are used to store hub sets searched.
54.2.2 Selecting hub locations
For locating good hub facilities, the elements included in the objective function must be
taken into account. In this research the metric index Ii =(Wi /jWj)+(1-Ci /jCj)+(i /jj) of
each node (i) is considered when generating initial hub locations and neighborhood solutions,
where Wi =j(Wji+Wij) is the total flow to and from node i, Ci is the total distance between node i
and the other nodes, andi is the capacity of node i (i) divided by the fixed cost for establishing
hub i (Fi).
Generating initial hub locations
Let k be the center of mass of the hub network and (xk, yk) be the coordinate of node k. That
is, the coordinate of k is (( ) / , ( ) / )i i i i i i
i i i i
x m m y m m    , where mi is the mass of node i and is
set to be ( ( )) / 2ij ji
j
W W . When generating initial hub locations, regard k as the origin. All the
nodes are then divided into p groups. For example, if there are two hubs (i.e., p=2), group 1
contains all the nodes within the half-plane above the 0and 180rays, and group 2 contains
all the nodes within the half-plane below the 180and 360rays. If there are three hubs, group
1 contains all the nodes within the region formed by the 0and 120rays, group 2 contains all
the nodes within the region formed by the 120and 240 rays, and so forth. From each group,
one node (i) is randomly selected as an initial hub based on the probability pi =
( ) / ( )i Gi ihI r I r  , where Gh contains all the nodes in group h and r is an adjustment
parameter to make (Ii+r) greater than 0.1.
Generating neighborhood solutions
The single-exchange procedure is used to generate neighborhood solutions. In this procedure,
each of the hubs is alternatively and randomly exchanged with a non-hub which is randomly
selected based on the probability pi = \( ) / ( )i N Hi iI r I r  , where H is the current hub set. The
procedures described in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 are then applied to determine the path of each
origin-destination pair. The exchange that obtains the best result is selected.
4.2.3 Allocation of the non-hubs to the hubs
Initially, each non-hub is allocated to its nearest and second-nearest hubs and the procedure
described in Section 4.3 is applied to determine the path of each origin-destination pair. Then, the
obtained solution is improved by the following procedure.
Improvement procedure
Step0. Let die be the distance between node i and its eth-nearest hub. Di = 1 , 1( )e he i h ied d   .
Step1. Starting from the non-hub with the largest Di, the allocation to the alternative hubs are
tried and the path for each origin-destination pair is re-determined. The alternative connections
leading to the best feasible solution are selected. If 70% of the non-hubs have been tried,
proceed to step 2. Otherwise, select the next non-hub to be tried.
Step 2. If the best solution is improved, return to step 1. Otherwise, stop the improvement
procedure.
4.2.4 Determination of origin-destination path
For the given hub set, we need to determine the path for each origin-destination pair. We
first applied the shortest path algorithm [43] to determine the path for each origin-destination pair.
Then, the path for each origin-destination pair is improved by four sub-procedures, namely
one-to-one (routing a selected pair via hub h* and re-routing a selected pair not via hub h*),
one-to-many (routing a selected pair via hub h* and re-routing some selected pairs not via hub h*),
many-to-one (routing some selected pairs via hub h* and re-routing a selected pair not via hub h*),
and many-to-many (routing some selected pairs via hub h* and re-routing some selected pairs not
74.2.5 Heuristic SCHLP_SA
Heuristic SCHLP_SA is now outlined as follows:
Step 0. Set the initial temperature (T), Markov chain length, tabu size, and stopping criterion.
Step 1. Set SIGNAL=0 (i.e., to indicate it is a pilot run for determining the number of hubs), p=|S|
(i.e., to set the initial number of hubs to be the pseudo-lower bound discussed in Section
4.2.1), and the overall cost to be infinite for p=|S|-1.
Step 2. Generate the initial hub locations and perform the procedures (i.e., the capacitated
shortest-path procedure and improvement procedure) for determining the path for each
origin-destination pair.
Step 3. Perform the single-exchange procedure and the procedures for determining the path for
each origin-destination pair. If the solution is improved, accept this solution. Otherwise,
use Metropolis’s criterion [15] to determine whether this solution is accepted. If Markov
chain length is reached, proceed to step 4.
Step 4. If SIGNAL=0, update the temperature. If the stop criterion for a pilot run is not yet
reached, return to step 3.
Step 5. If SIGNAL=1, proceed to step 6. If p <|S|, proceed to step 5-2.
Step 5-1. If the resulted reduction of the transportation cost is greater than the increase in
fixed cost, set p=p+1, reinitialize T, and return to step 2 (i.e., to increase the number of
hubs for another pilot run). If p=|S|+1, set p=|S|-1, reinitialize T, and return to step 2
(i.e., to decrease the number of hubs for another pilot run). Otherwise, set SIGNAL=1
(i.e., the number of hubs has been determined), p=p-1, and proceed to step 6 for
refinement run.
Step 5-2. If the resulted increase in the transportation cost is greater than the decrease in
fixed cost, set p=p+1, SIGNAL=1 (i.e., the number of hubs has been determined), and
proceed to step 6 for refinement run. Otherwise, set p=p-1, reinitialize T, and return to
step 2 (i.e., to decrease the number of hubs for another pilot run).
Step 6. Update the temperature. If the stopping criterion is reached, stop the whole procedure.
Otherwise, return to Step 3.
4.3 Random descent heuristic.
The initial solution of RDH was generated by randomly selecting 40% to 80% of the nodes
to be hubs. Each non-hub was allocated randomly to h hubs and the capacitated shortest-path
procedure described in section 4.2.4 is applied to determine the path for each origin-destination
pair. Then, RDH applied four types of transitions, commonly found in the literature, to generate
neighborhood solutions:
(1) AddHub: Set a randomly selected non-hub to be a hub.
(2) DeleteHub: Set a randomly selected hub to be a non-hub. The non-hubs originally allocated to
this hub were randomly reallocated.
(3) ReallocateNode: Reallocate a randomly selected non-hub from one hub to another hub.
(4) RelocateHub: Exchange a randomly selected hub with a randomly selected non-hub.
After transition (1)-(4) was performed, the paths for the related origin-destination pairs were
determined by applying the capacitated shortest-path procedure. The algorithm for the RDH is
stated as follows:
for i = 1,…, 2n
generate an initial feasible solution
repeat
Randomly select a transition. If it improves the current solution, apply it to the current
94.4.3 Computational Results
Computational results are reported in this subsection. The reported solutions of SCHLP_SA
and RDH were based on running both heuristics ten times each with a different random seed.
Results of the revised CAB data set
The computational results of the revised CAB problems are given in Table 1. RDH failed to
obtain the optimal solutions for 32 tested problems. The average gap produced by RDH was
2.58%. By contrast, SCHLP_SA were able to obtain the optimal solutions for every tested
problem. The maximum gap produced by CHLP_SA was within 0.08%. On an overall average,
the solution obtained by RDH was reduced 2.50% by SCHLP_SA.
Results of the revised AP data set
Table 2 shows the computational results for the revised AP problems. Cplex did not obtain
the optimal solutions for the tested problems with 40 and 50 nodes, due to run out of memory.
RDH failed to obtain the best solutions for 16 tested problems. The average gap produced by
RDH was 1.89%. As for SCHLP_SA, its performance was quite impressive. SCHLP_SA was
able to obtain the optimal solution for each tested problem (10-25 nodes) and produced the best
solution for every tested problem. Furthermore, unlike RDH, whose solutions were greatly
affected by random numbers, the random numbers only had a slight effect on the solution quality
of SCHLP_SA. The maximum gap produced by SCHLP_SA was within 1.06%. On an overall
average, the best solution (average solution) obtained by RDH was reduced 0.87% (1.67%) by
the average solution of SCHLP_SA. This indicates that SCHLP_SA is more effective than RDH.
11
each node (i) is considered when generating initial hub locations and neighborhood solutions,
except that i is the average capacity of the three levels of node i divided by the average fixed
cost for establishing hub i.
Generating initial hub locations and neighborhood solutions
The procedures described in section 4.2.2 are applied to generating initial hub locations and
neighborhood solutions. Note that the capacity level of each selected hub is randomly
determined.
5.2.3 Allocation of the non-hubs to the hubs
The procedures described in section 4.2.3 are applied to allocate the non-hubs to the hubs.
5.2.4 Determination of origin-destination path
The capacitated shortest-path procedure described in section 4.2.4 is first applied to
determine the path for each origin-destination pair. Then, a post-procedure is applied to improve
the obtained solution.
Post-procedure
Step 1: If there is any hub with less than 5% capacity left, increase its capacity level and proceed
to step 2. If there is any hub with more too much capacity left, decrease its capacity level and
proceed to step 2. Otherwise, stop.
Step 2: Perform the capacitated shortest-path procedure and return to step 1.
5.2.5 Heuristic MCHLP_SA
The structure of heuristic MCHLP_SA is similar to that of heuristic SCHLP_SA, except that
the capacity level of each selected hub needs to be randomly determined and the post-procedure
must be applied after performing the capacitated shortest-path procedure.
5.3 Random descent heuristic.
The initial solution of RDH was generated by randomly selecting 40% to 80% of the nodes
to be hubs. The capacity level of each hub is randomly determined. Each non-hub was allocated
randomly to h hubs and the capacitated shortest-path procedure described in section 4.2.4 was
applied to determine the path for each origin-destination pair. RDH then applied five types of
transitions to generate neighborhood solutions:
(1) AddHub: Set a randomly selected non-hub to be a hub and the capacity level of the hub is
randomly determined.
(2) DeleteHub: Set a randomly selected hub to be a non-hub. The non-hubs originally allocated to
this hub were randomly reallocated.
(3) ReallocateNode: Reallocate a randomly selected non-hub from one hub to another hub.
(4) RelocateHub: Exchange a randomly selected hub with a randomly selected non-hub and the
capacity level of the hub is randomly determined.
(5) ResetLevel: Reset the capacity level of a randomly selected hub to another level.
5.4 Computational experiments
In this section, the CAB and AP data sets are modified to evaluate the computational
characteristics of MCHLP_SA. The performance of MCHLP_SA is compared with the optimal
solutions obtained by Cplex and the RDH.
5.4.1 Data sets
For the CAB data set, the unit collection cost (i.e., χ) and the unit distribution cost (i.e., δ)
were both set to be 1, while the unit transportation cost on the inter-hub links (α) was set to be 0.5
and 0.6, respectively. In order to use this data set to test this type of hub location problems, the

6. Concluding remarks
In this research, we have dealt with the capacitated hub location problem with allocation
constraints. Hybrid heuristics, based on the simulated annealing, tabu list from the tabu search,
and improvement procedures have been proposed to determine the number of hubs, to properly
locate the hubs, and to determine the path for each origin-destination pair. Computational
characteristics of the proposed heuristics have been evaluated through extensive computational
experiments using the revised CAB and AP data sets. Computational performance of the
proposed heuristics has been compared with the optimal solutions and random descent heuristics.
Computational results have demonstrated that the proposed heuristics are capable of obtaining
optimal solutions for all small-size problems, and outperforms RDH in solving the large-size
problems. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristics, we believe, are ascribed to the developed
procedures for determining the number of hubs, for locating the hubs, and for determining the
path for each origin-destination pair. As for the research of nest year, we will extend this research
to consider that the cost for establishing a hub is a discrete function of capacity.

日期：99 年 8 月 19 日
一、參加會議經過
第九屆資訊與管理科學國際研討會(the 9th International Conference on Information and
Management Sciences)於 2010 年八月十一日至十九日在新疆烏魯木齊舉辦。今年有 100 多
篇論文投稿(接受的論文有 103 篇)，有來自 10 多個國家(China, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, USA, etc)的學者專家參與，並安排有
60 多場的論文發表。本研討會的目的，是提供國際學者們在資訊與管理科學領域之理論與
實務交流的機會。
我於八月十日下午 1:00 由桃園機場搭機往北京，轉機後飛往新疆烏魯木齊。經過一晚
休息後，於八月十一日至會場報到(圖一)。
本次研討會依不同論文主題，分多個時段，有多場的 plenary talks，以及有數個並行的
Sessions 進行論文發表。我在研討會中發表一篇學術論文(圖二、三)，標題為“The hub location
problem with alocation constraints”。我的論文被安排在十二日發表，同時段發表之論文顯示

strengthened formulation and proposed a relax-and-cut
algorithm. Racunica and Wynter [27] presented a new cost
model along with two variable-reduction heuristics.
Hamacher et al. [28] examined the feasibility polyhedron.
O’Kely [29] formulated the single allocation UHLP
(USAHLP) as a quadratic 0/1 programming problem. A
mixed 0/1 linear formulation was presented by Campbell
[17]. Abdinnour-Helm [30] proposed a hybrid heuristic.
Topcuoglu et al. [31] presented a GA and an SA heuristic.
A hybrid heuristic, based on the SA and tabu lists, was
proposed by Chen [32].
The capacitated hub location problem (CHLP) is
another type of hub location problem. Campbell [17]
presented a 0/1 mixed linear program for the capacitated
multiple allocation hub location problem (CMAHLP).
Ebery et al. [33] developed new formulations and solution
approaches. Several preprocessing procedures and
tightening constraints were proposed by Boland et al. [25].
Marin [34] considered that the flow between a given
origin-destination pair can be split into several routes. He
presented tight integer programming formulations and an
efficient method. Rodriguez-Martin and Salazar-Gonzalez
[35] proposed two branch-and-bound methods and a
heuristic. Carello et al. [36] developed a local search
approach. Ernst and Krishnamoorthy [37] developed two
heuristics and a branch-and-bound method for the
capacitated single allocation hub location problem
(CSAHLP). Labbe et al. [38] studied the polyhedral
properties and developed a branch-and-cut algorithm.
Randall [39] developed ant colony-based heuristics.
Although hub location problems have been studied
extensively, to the best of my knowledge, no research has
considered that each non-hub is connected to a few hubs,
perhaps two or three. In this paper a hybrid heuristic,
based on the simulated annealing (SA) method, tabu lists
from the tabu search (TS), and improvement procedures, is
proposed to deal with this type of capacitated hub location
problems. Computational characteristics of the proposed
heuristic are evaluated through computational experiments
using the revised Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) data set.
3. Simulated annealing method and tabu lists
The concepts of the simulated annealing (SA) method
and the tabu lists from the tabu search are briefly
described in this section.
3.1 Simulated annealing method
Basically, SA is a stochastic hill-climbing search
algorithm. It consists of a sequence of iterations, where
each iteration changes the current solution to a new
solution in the neighborhood of the current solution. Once
a neighborhood solution is created, the corresponding
change in the cost function is computed to determine
whether the neighborhood solution is accepted as the
current solution. If the neighborhood solution results in cost
reduction, this solution is directly taken as the current solution.
Otherwise, it is accepted according to Metropolis’s criterion 
[15]. According to Metropolis’s criterion, the neighborhood 
solution is accepted as the current solution ifr ≤ exp(-ΔE/T), in
which r is generated from U[0, 1], ΔE is the difference
between the costs of the two solutions, and T is the current
temperature. Three parameters need to be specified when
applying SA: the initial temperature; the temperature cooling
rate; and the number of iterations to be performed at each
temperature stage.
3.2 Tabu lists
Since moves not resulting in improvements may be accepted
in SA, it is possible to return to already obtained solutions.
Hence, a tabu list from the tabu search [16] is used to
overcome this dilemma. This tabu list store the moves during
the last s iterations (s is defined as the tabu size) such that the
moves leading to previously obtained solutions may be
avoided. In this research, a tabu list is used to store hub set
already searched.
4. Model
A mathematic model for this hub location problem is given
in this section to describe the problem structures. Let Wij be the
flow from origin i to destination j; cik be the distance between
nodes i and k; χbe the unit collection cost; αbe the unit
transportation cost on the inter-hub links; δbe the unit
distribution cost; Xijkm =1 if the flow from origin i to
destination j routed via hubs k and m in that order; and 0
otherwise; Fk be the fixed cost of establishing hub k; Γk be the
capacity of hub k ;Zkk = 1 if node k is a hub, and 0 otherwise;
Zik = 1 if node i can be allocated to hub k, and 0 otherwise; h
be the number of hubs that each non-hub can be allocated.
This hub location problem may be formulated as

Step 1. Set SIGNAL=0 (i.e., to indicate it is a pilot run for
determining the number of hubs), p=S (i.e., to set the
initial number of hubs to be the pseudo-lower bound
discussed in Section 5.1), and the overall cost to be
infinite for p=S-1.
Step 2. Generate the initial hub locations, perform the
allocation procedure, and determine the path for each
origin-destination pair.
Step 3. Perform the single-exchange and allocation
procedures and determine the path for each origin-
destination pair. If the solution is improved, accept this
solution. Otherwise, use Metropolis’s criterion [15] to 
determine whether this solution is accepted. If Markov
chain length is reached, proceed to step 4.
Step 4. If SIGNAL=0, update the temperature. If the stop
criterion for a pilot run is not yet reached, return to step
3.
Step 5. If SIGNAL=1, proceed to step 6. If p < S, proceed
to step 5-2.
Step 5-1. If the resulted reduction of the transportation
cost is greater than the increase in fixed cost, set p =
p+1, reinitialize T, and return to step 2 (i.e., to
increase the number of hubs for another pilot run). If
p=S+1, set p=S-1, reinitialize T, and return to step 2
(i.e., to decrease the number of hubs for another pilot
run). Otherwise, set SIGNAL=1 (i.e., the number of
hubs has been determined), p=p-1, and proceed to
step 6 for refinement run.
Step 5-2. If the resulted increase in the transportation
cost is greater than the decrease in fixed cost, set
p=p+1, SIGNAL=1, and proceed to step 6 for
refinement run. Otherwise, set p=p-1, reinitialize T,
and return to step 2 (for another pilot run).
Step 6. Update the temperature. If the stopping criterion is
reached, stop the procedure. Otherwise, return to Step 3.
6. Computational experiments
The CAB data set from the literature is modified to
evaluate the computational characteristics of CHLP_SA.
The number of hubs that each non-hub can be allocated
(i.e., h) was set to be 2 and 3, respectively.
6.1 Data set
The original CAB data set was introduced by O’Kely 
[18]. It was based on airline passenger flows between 25
US cities. The flow is symmetric and the fixed cost is the
same for all nodes. Four problem sizes were considered:
the first ten cities; the first fifteen cities; the first twenty
cities; and all twenty-five cities. For each problem size (n)
the unit collection cost (i.e., χ) and the unit distribution
cost (i.e., δ) were both equal to 1. In this research, the unit
transportation cost on the inter-hub links (α) was set to be 0.5
and 0.6, respectively. Then, the scheme of Ebery et al. (2000)
was employed to generate the capacity and fixed cost of each
node.
6.2 Computational Results
The computational results of the tested problems are given
in Table 1. According to Table 1, CHLP_SA were able to
obtain the optimal solutions for every tested problem. The
runtime required for CHLP_SA to solve each tested problem
was within 3.35 seconds. This indicates that CHLP_SA is
capable of effectively and efficiently solving the tested
problem.
7. Concluding remarks
In this research, we have dealt with the capacitated hub
location problem with allocation constraints. A hybrid heuristic,
based on the simulated annealing, tabu list from the tabu
search, and improvement procedures have been proposed to
determine the number of hubs, to properly locate the hubs, and
to determine the path for each origin-destination pair.
Computational characteristics of the proposed heuristic have
been evaluated through computational experiments using the
revised CAB data set. Computational results have
demonstrated that the proposed heuristic is capable of
obtaining optimal solutions for all tested problems. As for
future research, it may be desirable to extend this research to
the case where the cost for establishing a hub is a discrete
function of capacity.
