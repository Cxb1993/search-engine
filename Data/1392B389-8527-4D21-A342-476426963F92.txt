大陸為主的新興市場崛起，讓台灣塑膠射出
成型機械產業面臨升級轉型的壓力。同時，
原油價格飆漲，也使得塑膠原物料成本提

Keywords：Injection Machine, Energy-saving,  
 
Stress Analysis, Lightweight, Finite Element 
     
Nowadays, injection molding industry 
has faced a huge impact for worldwide 
challenges. Injection molding machine system 
properties has attracted attention for industrial 
applications in recent years. Because of the 
complexity 4C (Computer, Communication, 
Consumer Electronics, Car) parts design and 
the purpose of saving material, reducing cycle 
time, a commercial injection molding machine 
develop for ultra high speed, high strength 
mechanical body, clean, customization and 
system integration is an urgent necessary. 
    However, during the injection period, 
clamping unit plays the most important role 
for apply enough clamping pressure for 
molding. The tie-bar strength design is the 
most important part of the clamping unit, 
especially, the residue stress reduction, 
structural assemble propriety and the screw 
design of the tie-car. During operation, the 
low precision assemble design of the tie-bar 
screw will induce the stress concentration and 
cause a huge damage of the clamping unit in 
injection molding machine. 
    It was found that the failure was found to 
occur at the root of the first thread by 
transverse fatigue fracture induced by a 
pulsating tensile stress with multiple points of 
high stress concentration. The results show 
that the high stress value can be dispersed via 
reducing-pitch thread design. For the Taguchi 
method with orthogonal arrays was used to 
determine important factors affecting thread 
stress, it was found that the significant 
contributing factors in the descending order 
were tooth fillet (chamfer angle), tooth 
thickness angle, tooth thickness and film 
contact height; moreover, the tooth fillet is

三、文獻討論 
    兩板式射出機鎖模機構為兩板式，靜模
板(固定板)，動模板，四根哥林柱連接靜模
板與動模板，靜模板(或動模板)固定四個鎖
模油缸和兩個快速移模油缸，快速移模油缸
活塞桿與動模板相連，鎖模油缸的活塞桿也
是高壓鎖模拉桿，當動模板移至合模位置
後，四組兩個半螺母閉合環抱分別與四根哥
林柱螺紋齒相嚙合，鎖模油缸之高壓油建立
高壓，完成兩板式射出機鎖模動作。其中，
哥林柱是鎖模機構關鍵主要部件之ㄧ，除與
模板組成剛性框架外，還兼具導柱功能，使
其動模板沿著哥林柱滑動。當進行高壓鎖模
時，哥林柱螺紋部位要承受因高壓鎖模發生
受力變形。因此，螺紋部分的形狀、幾何尺
寸、強度、剛性與材質都會影響鎖模精度與
穩定性。根據謝[6]討論哥林柱螺紋不同牙形
角度的應力分佈情形，發現螺紋齒形對哥林
柱牙根處的應力集中影響很大，高應力集中
區發生在哥林柱與螺母第一嚙合螺紋牙根
處。從計算結果可以看出，除第一嚙合螺紋
牙根處的等效應力大於平均應力外，其後的
螺紋牙根處的應力值都很小。龔[7]使用有限
元素法對哥林柱進行有限元素應力分析，並
對哥林柱關鍵部位進行材料力學測試，結果
顯示哥林柱螺紋處的應力集中現象比較明
顯，並在此部位容易形成裂紋。歐[8]針對射
出機哥林柱上螺紋靠近應力消除溝處出現
斷裂問題，各以模板和哥林柱為整體建立有
限元模型對哥林柱進行應力與應變分析。從
分析結果顯示，為了使其應力分佈均勻化，
避免應力消除溝處出現過大的應力集中，並
在該處有較好的變形能力，以充分發揮應力
消除溝的功能。歐[9, 10]針對射出機哥林柱
靜模板(固定板)三角螺紋的應力分析與優化
做一討論，三板式射出機之兩端設有螺紋設 
 
計，其中一端的三角螺紋與螺母將哥林柱固
定於靜模板，另一端的梯形螺紋用於移動調
模板，以使鎖模機構能適應不同模具厚度的
需要。哥林柱是連接射出機靜模板、動模板
與調模板以形成封閉的框架結構，用以承受
鎖模力的重要承載零件，在射出機作動過程
中，哥林柱易在其三角螺紋與螺母嚙合上的
第一承載牙形根部發生早期斷裂現象。從結
果顯示，在對螺紋設計參數優化後，以彈性
材料有限元元素分析結果觀察，哥林柱螺紋
上的最大應力下降為原螺紋參數的 48%；以
彈性材料有限元素分析來觀察，哥林柱螺紋
處的最大等效應力為 370MPa 相比，有所下
降；在過載兩倍負荷的作用下，其最大等效
應力為 377MPa，僅比原設計參數下的
375MPa 略大，表示經優化後哥林柱螺紋具
有較強的抗過載能力。李[5]利用電測法及有
限元素分析軟體 ANSYS®對射出機哥林柱
進行應力與變形分析。其研究結果顯示，從
有限元素分析結果與測試值的相對誤差小
於 24%，也說明所建立之有限元素模型及所
加的邊界條件是合理的，分析結果是可信
的。 
 
四、研究方法

CAE 分析技術清楚掌握哥林柱與螺母在射
出機高壓鎖模下螺紋承受應力分布情形，並
嘗試將應力均勻分散不使應力集中在單一
螺牙上，除了利用軟體進行射出機哥林柱與
螺母設計與分析外，此計畫並與射出機造廠

驗值 S/N ratio 為-44.512(表九)，經與表七相
比較可知確實為最大 S/N 比值，亦即哥林柱
與螺母嚙合時產生之應力值最小。再將分析
之應力值做變異分析，可以計算出各控制因

據可知，牙底 R 弧控制因子超過 91%貢獻
度，顯示此因子對哥林柱螺紋應力值影響很
大。圖六為按照最佳化螺紋齒形參數設計控
制因子組合(A1B3C3D3)進行結構應力分析

167.29MPa。 
 
綜合上述實驗結果討論，可以歸納以下結
論： 
1. 兩板式射出機哥林柱螺紋與半螺母螺紋
接觸，第一齒承受了大部份的鎖模力，進
而發生疲勞破壞。從分析結果顯示，利用
螺紋齒厚不等設計方法，可以將應力分散
到其他齒上。 
2. 從哥林柱螺紋牙形參數設計之結構應力
干擾分析之結果，發現控制因子對哥林柱
螺紋應力值影響排序為牙底R弧＞螺紋
面接觸高度＞T型螺紋角度＞齒厚。 
3. 從哥林柱螺紋應力干擾分析之變異分析

超過98%貢獻度，顯示此因子對哥林柱螺
紋應力值影響很大暨重要干擾因子。 
4. 在進行哥林柱螺紋牙形參數設計最佳化

影響排序為牙底R弧＞齒厚＞T型螺紋角 
  度＞螺紋面接觸高度。 
 
 
5. 對兩板式射出機高壓鎖模時，哥林柱與螺

During each type of testing, five samples molded 
under the same molding conditions were used. Then the 
average value of five tested results was used for analysis 
and correlation processes. 
 
Tensile tests 
 
The specimen dimensions vary considerably 
depending upon the requirements and are described in 
detail in the ASTM book of standard. Then the ASTM 
D638 standard tensile test specimen was used in this 
study [4]. The tensile testing was conducted on HT-9102 
machine, whose full loads were 500 kgf. The test 
specimen is positioned vertically in the grips of the test 
machine. The grips are tightened evenly and firmly to 
prevent any slippage. The employed displacement speed 
of testing is 5 mm/min. The speed of testing is set at the 
proper rate and the machine is started. The specimen 
breaks around the center of part during the test. Figure 3 
shows a photograph of the tensile specimens after tensile 
test. The equation is used to calculate the tensile strength 
described by

where maxtσ  is the maximum tensile strength, maxtP  
the maximum load and A the cross section area. The 
variations of tensile strength for both with and without 
weldlines parts under different processing conditions 
were investigated carefully. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
In order to study the effects of mechanical properties 
on thick and thin-wall parts under different processing 
conditions for ultra high speed injection molding. The 
tensile test specimens with and without weldlines molding 
have thickness of 0.6 mm and 2.0 mm were investigated.  
 
For single gate molding 
 
The variations of tensile strength under different melt 
temperatures for single gate design are shown in Figure 4. 
It was found that a higher melt temperature will increase 
part tensile strength both on thickness of 2.0 mm and 0.6 
mm parts. Figure 5 shows how tensile strength varies with 
different mold temperatures. It is clear to see that the 
tensile strength, which decrease with increasing mold 
temperature at ultra high speed injection molding. 
Compared with thin-wall part, the tensile strength was 
greatly reduced at thick part by mold temperature 
increasing. Figure 6 describes the influence of injection 
speed (flow rate) on tensile strength, it can be seen that 
higher injection speed results in a higher tensile strength.  
 
For double gates molding 
 
In addition to single gate research results, it is of 
equal important to observe the effect of molding 
conditions on mechanical properties of double gates ultra 
high speed injection molding. For double gates design, 
the flow length to part thickness ratio is half of single gate 
design. And, the tensile strength of molded part was 
measured experimentally. From Figure 7, it shows the 
variations of tensile strength in weldline parts with 
various melt temperatures. At higher melt temperature, 
part tensile strength also increases and the situations are 
similar to that of non-weldline parts. Figure 8 shows 
higher mold temperature will improve the tensile strength 
in weldline parts. The results have the same trend with 
higher melt temperature. Mold temperatures not only 
lower the residual stress but also help the diffusion of 
molecular chains leading to a higher degree of bonding at 
the weldline interface. Figure 9 illustrates the influence of 
injection speed on tensile strength of weldline parts. 
Similarly, higher injection speed results in higher part 
strength. Generally speaking, part thickness exhibits 
significant effect on weldline strength reduction for 
conventional injection molding [5]. The experimental 
results show that ultra high speed injection provides 
longer bonding time at weldline interface and can delay 
the formation of frozen layer in filling stage for both 0.6 
mm and 2.0 mm thick parts.  
 
From the above discussion, it is known that tensile 
strength increase with increased injection speed. With 
various thicknesses, the effect of injection speed on 
mechanical strength for both single and double gates 
molding parts was depicted in Figure 10. It was found that 
higher injection speed will increase tensile strength of 
molded parts. And the variations of tensile strength on 
with and without weldlines parts are reduced at higher 
filling speed. The results also show that the ultra high 
speed injection molding processing not only improves the 
bond capability at the weldline interface but also the 
degree of molecular orientation along melt flow direction 
will more apparent on mechanical strength increasing. 
Young’s modulus can be considered as the intrinsic 
property of ABS materials. The variation of Young’s 
modulus basically originates from flow-induced 
molecular orientation. Higher degree of molecular 
orientation would result in higher value of Young’s 
modulus. It is expected that a thinner part will introduce 
higher level of molecular orientation due to larger flow 
shear stress during molding.

Abstract 
 
Ultra high speed injection molding plays a more 
significant role in molding thin-wall part in recent 3C 
products. Systematic studies on the proper molding 
window of Secure Digital (SD) card housing of 0.25 mm 
thick using ultra high speed injection molding have not 
yet been reported. In this study, a proper molding window 
for SD card housing using ABS and HDPE by varying 
mold temperatures from 30 ℃ to 100 ℃ and injection 
speeds from 100 mm/sec to 1200 mm/sec was 
investigated in details. Molded dimension and weight 
were measured experimentally. It was found that higher 
mold temperature and faster injection speed are two 
critical molding parameters that leading to good 
moldablilty for SD card housing.  
 
Introduction 
 
Secure Digital (SD) card is widely used in digital 
cameras, handheld computers, PDAs, mobile phones, 
GPS receivers, and video game consoles in recent years. 
SD card has small dimensions (24.0mm x 32.0mm x 
2.1mm), equivalent to those of a postage stamp, and 
weighs barely 2 grams. For SD card housing molding, the 
minimum part thickness reduces to 0.25 mm or even 
thinner and the flow length to part thickness ratio (L/t) of 
greater than 200. For molding material, ABS, PC and 
PC/ABS resins were utilized to molding SD card housing. 
To overcome the melt flow resistance within the ultra 
thin-wall mold cavity, faster injection speed and higher 
pressure are required. Therefore, the ultra high speed 
injection molding is one of proper solutions for molding 
thin-wall parts. Also, to avoid melt frozen due to the fast 
cooling, thin-wall parts need to be molded at relatively 
high injection speed during the filling stage resulting in 
special requirements for the machine performance. In 
addition, due to the fast injection speed melt is subjected 
to high viscous shear heating and the associated materials 
properties exhibit highly dynamic and non-equilibrium 
behavior [1-2].  
 
The purpose of this research is to investigate the 
effect of processing conditions including mold 
temperature and injection speed on molding window, 
weight and thickness variations of ultra high speed 
injection molding. For this purpose a precision ultra high 
speed injection machine was introduced. Both ABS and 
HDPE resins which with different material properties 
were utilized for SD card housing molding. Correlated of 
weight and thickness measurements were also conducted. 
 
Experimental Works  
 
A two-cavities SD card housing mold, with minimum 
product thickness of 0.25 mm, was designed to conduct 
the experiments was shown in Figure 1. The external 
dimension of SD card housing is 32 mm length, 24 mm 
width and the maximum thickness of 1 mm is depicted in 
Figure 2. In order to research the molding characteristics 
of such as super thin-wall and high L/t ratio part, a 100-
ton (Sodick HPS 100EH2) precision high speed high 
pressure injection molding machine equipped with an 
accumulator capable of delivering maximum screw speed 
of 1500 mm/sec and providing maximum injection 
pressure of 343 Mpa was used in this experiments. The V-
line injection unit provides stable plasticizing 
performance and accurate injection control, which has 
characteristics of highly accurate positioning and 
metering, high response rate, cleanness, and energy 
savings. In addition, ABS (PA-756 supplied by Chi Mei 
Industrial Company Ltd) and HDPE (LH606 supplied by 
USI Corporation) resins were used as molding materials 
in this study. To investigate the effect of the processing 
parameters including injection speed and mold 
temperature on proper molding windows, the correlated of 
molding experiments and measurements of SD card 
housing were also executed.  
 
Establishment of SD card housing molding windows 
 
For ultra high speed injection molding, the fast 
injection speed melt is subjected to high viscous shear 
heating will cause a viscosity reduction due to shear 
thinning effect and the associated materials properties 
ANTEC 2009 / 2113
and high pressure filling, the melt was injected into the 
mold cavity in a very short filling time.  
 
Thickness measurements of HDPE SD card housing 
molding 
 
By the same token, Figure 12 and Figure 13 show 
the effect of maximum and minimum injection speeds on 
part thickness at vary mold temperatures. In Figure 12, 
from these data it is apparent the HDPE polymer which is 
very sensitive to higher mold temperature in ultra high 
speed injection molding. On the contrary, the 
experimental results also show that the part thickness 
under different mold temperatures has less variation at 
lower filling speed and shown in Figure 13. 
 
Conclusions 
 
For ultra high speed injection molding, effect of 
processing conditions including mold temperature and 
injection speed for ABS and HDPE SD card housings 
molding were investigated in our study. The proper 
molding window is very important in thin-wall production, 
particularly in ultra high speed injection molding. To 
avoid melt frozen due to the fast cooling, thin-wall parts 
need to be molded at relatively high injection speed 
during the filling stage. Therefore, weight and thickness 
measurement usually utilized as a quality verification 
method of molded part. In this study, the effect of 
injection speed and mold temperature on product weight 
and thickness also were discussed. 
 
1. For ABS and HDPE SD card housing molding 
windows. It was found that the decreased injection speed 
followed the increase of mold temperature. Both ABS and 
HDPE molding materials have the same trend.  
 
2. For weight and thickness measurements, the higher 
injection speed will result in larger part weight and 
thickness of ABS and HDPE SD card housing molding. 
 
3. The experimental results show that the HDPE polymer 
is very sensitive to higher mold temperature in ultra high 
speed injection molding. 
 
4. Mold temperature and injection speed are two 
important processing conditions that affecting SD card 
housing molding.

were screen printed with a grid pattern (Figure 2). The 
grid pattern size is 2 mm × 2 mm and width of the lines is 
0.2 mm. The thickness of this ink layer is 0.006 mm. We 
used three kinds of printing ink as follows: (1) 
NORIPHAN® HTR series black color ink, (2) JUJO® 
9100 series black color ink and (3) NAZ-DAR® GV series 
black color ink. The NoriPress® SMK is a solvent-based 
screen printing adhesive, and can improve the adhesion of 
various laminated plastic films so NoriPress® SMK was 
utilized as adhesive layer to bond molded parts. 
 
This research divides into two stage experiments. The 
first stage experiment used PC film with two kinds of 
thickness and three kinds of ink to make up six types of 
testing conditions (Table 1). For each type of specimen, 5 
samples were manufactured at the same molding 
conditions such as melt temperature of 245 , mold ℃
temperature of 55 , packing ℃ pressure of 32 MPa and 
injection speed of 32.4 cm3/sec. We could compare the 
ink washout area A and destroyed area B of grid pattern 
with each type of testing specimen to obtain the most 
suitable molding conditions for Nylon6 nanocomposites 
and pure Nylon6 molding.  
     
The second stage experiment used the most suitable 
molding conditions of film and ink to investigate the 
effects of processing conditions on part moldability for 
Nylon6 nanocomposites and Nylon6 molding. The related 
processing conditions including melt temperature, mold 
temperature, injection speed and packing pressure are 
listed in Table 2. The ink washout problem were defined 
by measuring ink washout area A and destroyed area B of 
grid pattern. In this study, we used Moldflow® MPI5.0 to 
analyze the shear stress around gate and to understand the 
effects of processing conditions on ink washout. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
First stage experiment  
 
In first stage experiment, we would like to discuss 
the effect of ink types and film thicknesses on ink 
washout during specified molding conditions. Figure 3 
shows the distributions of washout area A under different 
ink types and film thicknesses. It is clear to see that the 
BH1 specimen has smallest washout area A. About the 
destroyed pattern area B, the BH1 specimen also has least 
destruct pattern of test specimens and shown in Figure 4. 
On comparing the effect of film thickness on washout and 
destroyed area between Figure 3 and Figure 4. It was 
found that the 0.125 mm thick film has smallest ink 
washout than that of 0.175 mm thick film.  
 
From the above discussions, it can be concluded that 
the combination of PC film with thickness of 0.125 mm 
and Noriphan® HTR ink is good for IMD film formation.  
 
Second stage experiment  
 
For this stage, the effects of processing parameters 
including melt temperature, mold temperature, packing 
pressure and injection speed on Nylon6 nanocomposites 
and Nylon6 IMD molding quality were investigated in 
details. Figure 5 shows the effect of melt temperatures on 
ink washout and destroyed pattern area. It can be seen 
that higher melt temperature will decrease ink washout 
and destroyed area due to the higher melt temperature 
will cause a reduction of melt viscosity and shear stress to 
assist melt flow through the gate region.  
 
For Figure 6, it is apparent that the effect of mold 
temperatures on ink washout and destroyed pattern area. 
The higher mold temperature will decrease ink washout 
and destroyed area slightly. The results show that high 
mold temperature will slow down the frozen layer 
formation and the pressure drop also will be affected. 
About the effect of packing pressures on washout and 
destroyed area, it may be noted that the washout and 
destroyed area were no significant via packing pressure 
change and the result was presented in Figure 7. From 
Figure 8, it was found that the washout and destroying 
area, which increase with increasing injection speed. The 
faster injection speed will cause higher shear stress near 
gate region and melt is subjected to high viscous shear 
heating. 
 
Based on the experimental results, the following 
observations have been found. According to material 
properties, it is important on comparing the effect of film 
thicknesses on ink washout and destroyed area under 
different processing conditions. Obviously, using Nylon6 
nanocomposites as molding material for IMD injection 
molding has less influence on ink washout. Su et al. [11] 
have conducted preliminary research regarding the 
influence of molding conditions on molding 
characteristics of Nylon6 nanocomposites molding. 
Comparaed with Nylon6 material, Nylon6 
nanocomposites has better flow property than Nylon6. It 
was found that Nylon6 nanocomposites has lower 
viscosity value and can reduce 50% washout region than 
the Nylon6. It also shows that Nylon6 nanocomposites 
was good for IMD molding. 
 
To account for the effect of shear stress on ink 
washout under different molding conditions including 
melt temperature, mold temperature, packing pressure and 
injection speed. Moldflow® software was used to simulate 
the shear stress near the gate region during melt filling 
analysis. Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the shear stress 
distributions near the gate region by CAE simulation 
(Moldflow®). It is clear to see that the element number of 
T1562, close to gate location, has largest shear stress

Abstract 
 
In-mold roller (IMR) injection molding is one of the  
commonly used In-Mold Decoration technology for ink 
transfer. The effect of processing parameters on part‘s 
warpage is very important for product quality. In this 
study, the PET film with thickness of 0.05mm and 
0.036mm is molded and computer simulation analysis is 
performed to compare the result with experiment. It was 
found that high melt temperature and thick film would 
result in heat stagnation between surface-frozen layer and 
film interface leading to a large part’s warpage. However, 
a high mold temperature resulted in a low warpage. For 
IMR molding, the mold temperature difference between 
core and cavity surface was about 6.71~12.94℃ and the 
warpage varied from 0.15mm to 0.91mm under specified 
conditions. 
 
Introduction 
 
Due to technologies development in modern society, 
consumers are raising their expectation on a product’s 
surface decoration quality and design when on shopping. 
In-Mold Decoration (IMD) technology for ink transfer in 
injection molding process is invented to meet this 
expectation. The advantages of IMD include a value 
added for product, a production efficiency enhancement, 
and a cost saving for 3C industry requirement. In-Mold 
Roller (IMR), one of IMD technologies, is the most 
mature methodology. The principle of IMR is to pre-print 
a designed pattern and texture on a roll of film.  Apply the 
roller and feeder to send the film into a mold cavity 
surface before injection. During the filling and cooling 
process, the pre-print ink (pattern and texture) on the film 
will be transferred to the product’s surface (Figure 1) [1-
2].  
During the IMR process, no solvent is involved 
which is friendly to environment. However, the challenge 
of IMR process is to overcome the film positioning, ink 
wash-out, and product’s warpage issues. During the 
filling stage, there is film flash away and ink washout 
problem. And during the cooling stage, there is a warpage 
problem due to an imbalanced thermal dissipation on both 
sides of product. Up to date, studies on IMR [3-4] focused 
on the process introduction. Wong et al. [5] pointed out 
that the high heat transfer from polymer to the film which 
induces a soft film and causes wrinkles on the film 
surface. In turn, eventually results in a pattern shift on the 
product surface especially for the PET film. Love et al. [6] 
compared the cost between IMR and traditional printing, 
and found out there is a 15% to 35% cost saving by IMR. 
Meanwhile, the shininess property on product surface is a 
dominant factor to ensure the printed ink can resist to UV 
light and moisture. Wang et al. [7], in his study of inked 
PC film, concluded that the ink can be washed off due to 
high melt temperature since the ink on the film can 
sustain a temperature of 135℃. 
The purpose of this project is to study the effect of the 
process parameters, melt temperature, mold temperatures, 
and the polymer film thickness, on the warpage of the 
IMR product.  To ensure the best quality of  IMR 
products, the warpage must be kept as low as possible. 
 
Experimental Works 
 
In this study, the dimension of molded part is a 
square plate of 98.5mmx98.5mm with thickness 1.2mm 
(Figure 2). The material is Polypropylene with melt flow 
index of 9. The film materials are PC (thickness 0.175 
mm) and PET (thickness 0.05mm and 0.036mm). The 
injection machine used is Krauss-Maffet (type KM50-
1602), the max. injection speed is 300m/s and the max. 
injection pressure is 193 MPa. The temperature sensors 
and signal processor are made by PRIAMUS company. 
 The diameter of temperature sensor is 1mm and it 
was buried on the mold surface where is the center of 
plate (Figure 3) [8]. The equipment for warpage 
measurement is a 2D Coordinate Measuring Machine 
(type PIM-2515). The process parameters and film 
materials are summarized as Table 1. Meanwhile, the 
definition of heat stagnation in the film is as follow,  
 
Heat stagnation = a+b  
 
 Where a is the temperature difference between the 
cavity and the core without film attached and b is the 
temperature difference between the cavity and the core 
with film attached (Figure 4) [8].
