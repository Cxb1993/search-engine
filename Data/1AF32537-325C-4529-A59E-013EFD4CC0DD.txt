a large CFO. To reduce the effect, selective PIC and 
successive interference cancellation (SIC) was also proposed 
in [8]. All the methods mentioned above either require high 
computational complexity, or have performance loss when the 
number of users increases or the CFO becomes large.  
In this project, we propose a low-complexity ZF method to 
cope with the CFO problem. The main idea is to use Newton's 
method for iterative matrix inversion. Taking the advantage of 
the special structure of the CFO-induced interference matrix, 
we are able to develop a method involving fast Fourier 
transform (FFT). With our specially designed initial value, the 
iteration can stop within two to three iterations. While the 
performance of the proposed method is similar to that of the 
direct ZF method, the required computational complexity is 
much lower. 
 
II. SIGNAL MODEL 
Fig. 1 depicts an uplink OFDMA system with Q  users. In 
an uplink OFDMA system, the available bandwidth B  is 
divided into cN equally spaced subbands. Each subcarrier 
uses a subband with a bandwidth / 1/( )c c sf B N N T∆ = = , 
where sT  is the symbol sampling period. In such a system, Q  
users share the cN  subcarriers. Without loss of generality, we 
assume that each user uses /sc cN N Q=  subcarriers. For the 
qth user, the transmitted frequency-domain signal at the kth 
subcarrier is denoted by qkx , where qk ∈ ϒ  and qϒ  is the set 
of subcarriers for the qth user.It is assumed that 
i jϒ ϒ = ∅∩ for i≠ j and 1 {0,1,2,..., 1}Qq q cN= ϒ = −∪ . 
This type of allocation scheme avoids interference between 
active users. Here, we adopt the interleaved allocation scheme. 
In other words, the qth user utilizes the set of subcarriers 
{ 1, 1 ,..., 1 ( / 1) }q cq q Q q N Q Qϒ = − − + − + − . For each 
user, we assume that the CP length is long enough to prevent 
the intersymbol interference (ISI) effect. Also the channel is 
quasi-static, i.e., it is constant in one OFDM symbol period. 
Thus, there is no intercarrier interference (ICI) resulting from 
the time-varying channel effect. However, each user has a 
carrier frequency offset (CFO) between the MS and the BS. It 
is apparent that the CFO of the qth user will induce the ICI to 
other users. 
Consider a specific OFDM symbol of the qth user. The 
received time-domain signal after CP removal (excluding 
noise) can be expressed as 
,qq q= hy C x                               (1) 
where qx  is the vector representation of the qth user's time-
domain OFDM symbol, i.e., ( )1/q H qcN=x G x . Here 
qx  is the vector representation of the qth user's frequency-
domain OFDM symbol, and G  is the normalized DFT matrix.

channel effect, the received OFDM symbol is also corrupted 
by the ICI (due to CFO) and additive white Gaussian noise 
(AWGN). As a result, the received time-domain OFDM 
symbol can be expressed as

Note that qma  is a column vector and qcD  and qεD  are both 
complex diagonal matrices. As assumed, 0W  is a diagonal 
matrix. Thus (18) only involves one DFT with size cN , Q 
IDFTs with size /cN Q , and some vector operations. The

implemented by FFT (IFFT) with a complexity proportional to 
2logc cN N  ( ( ) ( )2/ log /c cN Q N Q ). Thus, the 
required computational complexity can be dramatically 
reduced. 
The final thing we have to deal with is how to determine the 
initial value. A good initial value can reduce the iteration 
number significantly. As mentioned, we let the initial value be 
a diagonal matrix

c cN N×  diagonal matrix with the kth diagonal entry being

to do the job. The criterion is given by

where the parameter S is the span of one-sided ICI 
( 0 / 2 1cS N≤ ≤ − ) and mod( , ) /x y x y x y= − ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦ . The 
approximation is based on the fact that the ICI on a subcarrier 
mainly comes from a few neighboring subcarriers. 
For the direct ZF method, the matrix inverse is obtained by 
solving a set of linear equations as ZFMy = r  , where ZFy  is 
an estimate of y . This can be implemented by triangular 
factorization (Gaussian elimination), and forward and 
backward substitution [5]. For reference convenience, we 
refer to the method in [11] as CLJL-PIC. The required 
computational complexity for the proposed method, the CLJL-
PIC method, and the direct ZF method is summarized in Table 
1 (for the CLJL-PIC method, p is the number of iterations for 
the PIC). 
 
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
We consider an uplink OFDMA system with parameters 
64cN =  and 16gN = . The number of users in an OFDMA 
system is 4. The wireless channel length is set as 15hL = . 
We assume that the power delay profile for the qth user has an 
exponential shape, i.e., 
12
, 0
/ hq qLn nq n ne e
λ λσ −− −== ∑ , where n 
is the tap index, and qλ  is a parameter controlling the power 
distribution for the qth user. Here, we let 
1 2 3 4[ , , , ] [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]
T Tλ λ λ λ =  for each user. Each 
channel tap is randomly generated according to the Rayleigh 
distribution. 
First, we consider a 64-QAM modulation scheme and set 
CFOs as [0.1, -0.2, -0.05, 0.2]. Several compensation methods 
are compared. For convenience, we refer to the method in [3] 
as the conventional method and that in [4] as the CLJL 
method. Fig. 2 shows the BER performance of the proposed 
method with S=2. The performance without CFOs is also 
simulated and it can be used as the performance bound. From 
the figure, we can see that the conventional and CLJL 
methods perform poorly. The CLJL-PIC method (even with 3-
stage PIC) has a large performance loss as compared with the 
performance bound. This is because when the modulation has 
a large QAM-size, the CLJL-PIC method is sensitive to the 
residual MUI. Also the initial value obtained by the CLJL 
method is not good enough for the PIC method. With only 
two iterations, the proposed method can approach the direct 
ZF method and is close to the performance bound. 
Then, we consider the scenario of larger CFOs. We set 
CFOs as [0.1, -0.4, -0.05, 0.2] and the modulation scheme as 
4-QAM. Fig. 3 shows the BER performance of the proposed 
method with S=2. The conventional and CLJL methods still 
perform poorly. The CLJL-PIC method (even with 3-stage 
PIC) has a large performance loss and also has an obvious 
error floor phenomenon. In this scenario, we can see that the 
PIC operation in the CLJL-PIC method almost can not 
improve the performance at all. However, the proposed 
method with two iterations still has the similar performance 
with the direct ZF method. Also, the proposed method has a 
little performance loss as compared with the performance 
bound. This performance loss is mainly due to the noise 
enhancement effect.  
From above results, we can conclude that the proposed 
CFO compensation method is robust to the large modulation 
QAM-size and CFO, and provide the best performance among 
the methods considered. Now, we consider the issue of the 
computational complexity. With the system used in 
simulations, the proposed method with two iterations can 
achieve the similar performance as the direct ZF method. 
Using this setting and Table 1, we can find that the required 
real multiplications for the proposed algorithm is 20% of 
those for the CLJL-PIC method (with 3-stage PIC), and 0.037 
of those for the direct ZF method. The proposed method can
