22. System assumptions
Consider a single-server discrete-time queue in which the time axis is segmented into a
sequence of equal intervals called slots and all queueing activities (arrivals, departures, breakdowns
and repairs) occur at the slot boundaries. Let the time axis be marked by m 0, 1, 2, · · ·. Consider
the epoch m and suppose that the departures and the completion epochs of the repairs occur in
(m−,m), and arrivals and the beginning epochs of the repairs in (m, m+). That is, the Early Arrival
System (EAS) rule is adopted in the present paper. It is assumed that customers arrive according to
geometrical arrival processes with parameter , that is,  is the probability that an arrival occurs
in a slot and  1 is the probability that there is no arrival in a slot. Arriving customers at the
system form a single waiting line and are served in the order of their arrivals. There is a single
server that provides his service and serves only one at a time. The service times of customers are
independent and identically geometric distribution with rate , where  1 is the probability
that a customer does not conclude his service in a slot.
The server can break down at any time, and when the server breaks down it is immediately
fixed. The customer just being served before the breakdown waits until the server is repaired to
complete his remaining service time (i.e., the customers’ service time is cumulative). The lifetime 
of the server is assumed to be geometrically distributed with parameter , where  1 is the
probability that a failure does not occur in a slot. The repair times of server follows a geometrical
distribution with parameter , where  1 is the probability that a failure does not be
concluded in a slot. Various stochastic processes involved in the system are independent of each
other. Two breakdown types of single server are considered.
Type 1: The server can break down only when there is at least one customer in the system.
Type 2: The server can break down even if no customers are in the system.
Such model has potentially applications in practical systems. For example, the wireless mobile
devices accessing the wireless networks with different data rate can be analyzed in the discrete-time
condition. Particularly, handling the accesses from wireless mobile devices, the access gateway may
meet an unpredictable breakdown. The analysis and results presented in this paper can efficiently
model such systems.
2.1 The Markov chain of Type 1
We investigate the Geo/Geo/1 queueing system with server breakdowns, where the server is
subject to breakdowns when he is working. Let nL be the number of customers in the system at

3. The matrix-geometric property
Because the infinitesimal generator given in (1) is a special case of equation (5.2.1) of Neuts
[17], we know that the QBD of Type 1 is a periodic and positive recurrent. Let  denote the
stationary probability vector of the QBD. It is the unique solution of the system P , where
)( 210  with )( 0,00   and )( 1,0, nnn   , ,3,2,1n . By applying the
matrix-geometric approach, the steady-state vector 1n can be determined recursively as
1 nn  , for 1n , where  is the minimal non-negative solution to the matrix quadratic
equation below:

10 AAA  . (8)
The matrix  is a very important matrix needed in evaluating the performance measures of
analyzing a QBD process. It is known as the rate matrix of the Markov chain Ρ. (see Neuts [17])
The computation of 
To obtain , we apply the approach of the infinite level-dependent QBD described in
Latouche and Ramaswami [18]. Note from the matrix (1) that starting from level )2( the matrix
B10 change to A2 which implies that we have an infinite level-dependent QBD. The P QBD model of
this paper is partially level-independent up to a certain level ( )1( ) and then becomes infinite
level-dependent from level )2( .
The infinitesimal generator of the transient continuous-time Markov chain is restricted to level
)2( before it reaches )1( (see [18]) and is given by

For this purpose, equation (6) is assumed to hold so that P is positive recurrent. Substituting
(14) into equation (11), it follows from the argument by Neuts [17] that P is a periodic and
irreducible infinitesimal generator with finite dimensions. The linear equation system

7. Cost analysis
In the real-life situations, the parameters  and  of a queueing service system are not
usual to be controlled their values due to outside factors of system. We develop a steady-state
expected cost function per unit time and impose some constraints on the system parameters in
which  and  are decision variables. The continuous variables  and  are between zero
and one (due to system assumptions). The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal value
of (,), say ),( **  so as to minimize this function and maintain the system parameters at a
certain level. To do this, we define the cost elements in the following:
sC cost incurred per unit time of providing a service rate,
wC cost incurred per unit time for customers present in the system,
dC cost incurred per unit time of providing a repair rate.
The cost minimization problem can be presented mathematically as

where

The cost function in (22) is assumed to be linear in the expected number of the indicated
quantity.
It is extremely difficult to obtain the useful analytical results for the optimum value (,).
This is due to the fact that  and  are continuous quantities, and the cost function is highly
non-linear, complex and discontinuous in some dimensions. We will present a procedure that makes
it possible to calculate the optimal value ),( **  .
We globally search (,) until the minimum value of ),( F , say ),( ** F and
constraints (21) are satisfied. The cost minimization problem can be illustrated mathematically as

we observe that (i) * and * increase as  increases and (ii) * decreases as  decreases.
Under given other parameters, we also find * of Type 2 is less than that of Type 1 and * of
Type 2 is more than Type 1.
8. Conclusions
We have introduced a Geo/Geo/1 queueing system arisen from some practical situations,
where the server may meet unpredictable breakdowns. The stationary probabilities are obtained
from the two efficient algorithms, in matrix forms and using matrix analytic approaches with the aid
of computer software. We also perform some numerical results that illustrate how system
parameters influence the important system characteristics. Finally, a cost model is developed to
determine the optimal value of ),(  at a minimum cot and the optimal parameter values are
found by the Quasi-Newton method. This research presents an extension of the discrete-time model
theory and the analysis of the model will provide a useful performance evaluation tool for more
general situations arising in practical applications, such as digital computer and communication
systems.
