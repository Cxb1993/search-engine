 In performing this project, we have 
produced 1 specialized book [1], 10 journal 
papers listed in SCI [2-11], and >10 
conference and proceeding papers as more 
presentation in various international and 
national academic conferences. On the 
beginning, P.I. had planned 6-items of 
research work. All have been achieved with 
good results, plus some other items listed in 
the abstract. The 11-items of them are 
reviewed and discussed one-by-one item 
(some contents modified according to the 
research results) as follows.  
 
1) A specialized review book on III-Nitride 
semiconductor materials [1]  
 III-Nitride semiconductor materials – 
(Al,InGa)N – are excellent wide gap 
semiconductors which are very suitable for 
modern electronic and optoelectronic 
applications. Remarkable breakthroughs have 
been achieved in recent years for research and 
development (R&D) in these materials and 
devices, such as high-power and high brightness 
blue-green-white light emitting diodes (LEDs) 
and blue laser diodes (LDs) as well as other 
optoelectronics and electronics devices and 
applications. III-Nitrides-based industry is 
forming up and new economic developments 
from these materials are promising. It is expected 
that III-Nitrides-based LEDs might replace the 
traditional light bulbs to realize a revolution in 
lightings and change entire human life in this 
century, similar to Edison’s invention of the 
electric light bulb more than one-hundred year 
ago.  
The developments on these materials and 
devices are so-quickly moving. Many data or 
knowledge, even just published quit recently, 
have been modified and needed to upgrade. This 
new book covers the rapidly new developments 
and achievements in the field, in particular those 
made after entering the 21st century.  
The book is organized for a wide range of 
audiences and covers each of the basic and 
critical aspects of III-Nitrides science and 
technology. Each chapter, written by experts in 
the field, reviews the important topics and 
achievements in recent years, discusses 
progresses made by different groups, and 
suggests further works needed. This book 
provides useful information to material growth, 
characterization, application and development on 
the III-Nitrides semiconductor materials. The 
book presents the key properties of III-Nitrides 
materials, describes key technologies and 
demonstrates the remaining challenging issues in 
material growth and device fabrication for future 
R&D in the 21st century. This book can serve 
well to material growers and evaluators, device 
design and processing engineers as well as 
potential users of III-Nitrides technologies, 
including new comers, postgraduate students, 
engineers and scientists in the III-Nitrides field. 
 
2) Control and Improvement of Crystalline 
Cracking from GaN Thin films grown on Si 
by Metal-organic Chemical Vapor 
Deposition [2]  
 In this study we have employed 
MOCVD to grow a series of GaN thin films 
on Si under different conditions and films 
were characterized by a variety of techniques. 
Nomarski microscopy showed different 
cracking patterns for GaN/Si depending on 
growth and source flow parameters. Film 
thicknesses were determined from optical 
reflectance. High resolution XRD, Raman 
scattering and photoluminescence 
measurements confirmed their wurtzite 
crystalline GaN structures, and the 
corresponding line shape analyses revealed 
their difference corresponding to the NM 
observations. It’s found that one sample has 
the best shape of widest cracking distribution, 
the narrowest PL and Raman band, another 
one takes the 2nd position while the third one 
is the 3rd one with poor surface morphology. 
Other two have the high density of cracks. 
The high temperature AlN buffer growth 
with Si-doping and the Si-delta doping 
during the GaN layer growth are useful to 
realize the control and improvement of 
cracking in GaN/Si. 
 
3) Comparative Investigation of high 
resolution transmission electron microscopy 
and infrared spectroscopy for GaN grown on 
sapphire by metalorganic chemical vapor 
deposition [3]  
 In this research work, the influence of 
dopants on the dislocation structure and its 
further influence on the IR response of GaN 
films are studied by cross-section and high 
resolution TEM, AFM and FTIR. 
Comparative TEM and FTIR study shows 
 6
determined. The unique T-behavior of PL 
spectra is observed for the QW-related 
emission band, which is due to the quantum 
dot like structure features within the MQW 
structures. Quantum confined Stokes effect 
was observed from the comparison of PL and 
PLE measurements. A further penetrating 
investigation is helpful to better understand 
the luminescent mechanisms and find ways 
to further improve the material design and 
growth of InGaN/GaN MQWs for the wide 
spectral LED applications. 
 
7) Properties of the CdTe/InSb Interface 
Studied by Optical and Surface Analytical 
Techniques [7]  
 The interface properties of CdTe/InSb 
grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) 
and the In interdiffusion were studied by 
optical and surface techniques of 
photoluminescence (PL), X-ray 
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and 
Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). 
The In interdiffusion has been revealed 
directly by SIMS depth profile and XPS In 
3d and 4d spectra, indicating that the In 
concentration in CdTe film grown with high 
substrate growth temperature Ts is much 
higher than that with low Ts. Higher Ts 
enhanced the In interdiffusion across the 
CdTe/InSb interface, leading to more 
indiums detected. These are correlated to the 
PL spectra from two Ts samples which are 
quite different. The low Ts one possesses 
strong free and acceptor-bound excitons, 
relatively weaker and sharp emissions in the 
deep level range of 1.4-1.5 eV, characteristic 
of high quality of single crystalline CdTe. 
The high Ts one has dull FE feature only and 
strong defect-related E and F lines and deep 
1.44 eV broad band. It predicts that there 
would exist an exact lattice match between 
CdTe and InSb at the optimum Ts of 185oC 
and that a(CdTe) > a(InSb) as T<185oC and 
a(CdTe) < a(InSb) as T>185 or 200oC. At 
higher Ts, the bigger lattice mismatch would 
lead to dislocations and In will diffuse more 
efficiently along these dislocation lines from 
InSb substrate into CdTe layer. The big 
amount of In leads to the strong signals of 
XPS spectra and SIMS profiles, and also to 
the strong In- and defect-related PL features. 
Optimizing Ts and other growth conditions 
are efficient to depress the In interdiffusion 
during the II-VI/III-V growth. 
 
8) Optical and Transport Properties of InSb 
Thin Films Grown on GaAs by Metalorganic 
Chemical Vapor Deposition [8]  
 We had performed the optical 
characterization on a series of InSb thin films 
grown on GaAs by MOCVD under different 
growth conditions by way of far infrared 
spectroscopy and theoretical simulation. 
Various mode parameters, e.g., the TO mode 
frequency, carrier concentration, mobility, 
etc. were obtained from these InSb/GaAs 
materials. All the specimens were analysed 
by a dielectric response model. It was found 
that the extra modes appear in FIR spectra 
due to the interface reaction between the film 
and substrate. Interesting splitting of the 
GaAs transverse optical phonon mode was 
observed and explained using the dielectric 
response model to fit the FIR reflectance 
spectrum by varying the InSb film thickness. 
Effects of III/V source ratios were 
successfully studied by FIR spectroscopy and 
the optimized growth parameters have been 
obtained. The InSb film grown with an III-V 
ratio of 4.1 possesses the highest carrier 
concentration and mobility. The results of 
this study show that MOCVD technology is 
capable to produce high quality far infrared 
InSb epitaxial materials, and the FTIR 
method is a very useful tool for 
non-destructive characterization of large size 
wafers in industrial mass production. 
 
9) Optical and materials properties of 
Sandwiched Si/SiGe/Si Heterostructures [9]  
A comprehensive characterization by 
multiple technique measurements has been 
performed for the Si/Si1-xGex/Si structure 
grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at 
low temperature of 450oC. X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) measurements confirmed the single 
crystallinity and the (100) orientation of the 
Si1-xGex layer. The Ge compositions and 
layer thicknesses were precisely determined 
by Rutherford backscattering (RBS). Ion

1 Introduction 
CdTe is an important material for radiation detectors and photovoltaic (PV) solar cells [1], with various 
active research activities in recent two decades [1–18]. CdTe/InSb is a significant system because of the 
very close lattice mismatch (∆a/a ~ 5 × 10–4) between them [6, 18], and therefore, the dissimilar het-
eroepitaxy between II–VI and III–V compounds, such as CdTe on InSb or InSb on CdTe, is very attrac-
tive for applications in optoelectronics [6, 9–11, 13, 14, 16–18]. We have recently performed a series of 
investigations on CdTe/InSb heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [9, 11, 16–18]. 
The crystalline perfection and optical/structural properties of CdTe thin films on InSb were greatly af-
fected by the InSb substrate growth temperature, Ts, and other growth conditions. It has been reported [5, 
6, 10, 13] that In diffuses easily across the CdTe/InSb interface and modifies the optical and electronic 
properties of epitaxial CdTe. In this work, we present a combined study of optical and surface science 
analyses on the indium interdiffusion in MBE-grown CdTe/InSb heterostructures. 
2 Experimental 
The CdTe films were grown in an MBE machine on (001) InSb substrates which were polished on both 
sides, ion beam cleaned and subsequently annealed at ~200 °C prior to MBE growth. Two typical sam-
ples involved in this study, No. 248 and 217, were grown at the same growth rate of 0.70 µm/hr to a film 
thickness of about 1.4 µm, but at different substrate growth temperatures, Ts, of 200 °C for No. 248 and 
265 °C for No. 217. PL measurements were performed at 2 K, excited by the Ar+-514.5 nm line with 
4.3 mW focused at 200 µm spot, and detected by a PL system with a 0.75 m spectrometer, a cooled 
GaAs cathode photomultiplier and a lock-in amplifier under computer control. 
 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed in a VG ESCALAB MkII using 
a Mg Kα X-ray source (1253.6 eV, 120 W) at a constant analyzer pass energy of 20 eV. The SIMS depth 
profiles were taken in a VG SIMSLAB connected to the ESCALAB via a preparation chamber using a

3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
Figure 3 shows the comparative XPS In 4d energy spectra, for these two as-received samples, while 
Fig. 4 shows their XPS In 3d spectra after light Ar+ sputtering to remove any surface contaminants. 
Strong In signals appear from the Ts = 265 °C sample in both figures while the signals are significantly 
weaker for Ts = 200 °C sample. Note that XPS probes only the surface region to a depth of about 5 nm. 
Since the as-received and sputtered In 4d and 3d XPS spectra are virtually unchanged for both samples, 
we conclude that these In signals are not due to subsequent surface contamination. 
4 Discussion 
From the present study, the following observations are obtained: 
 (1) The surface analytical techniques reveal In interdiffusion directly. The SIMS depth profile and the 
XPS In 3d and 4d spectra indicate that the In concentration in the CdTe film grown at high Ts is signifi-
cantly higher than that at low Ts, and this can be attributed to indium interdiffusion from the InSb sub-
strate. Higher substrate growth temperatures enhances In interdiffusion across the CdTe/InSb interface, 
leading to a higher indium concentration in the Ts = 265 °C sample. 
 (2) PL spectra from the two Ts samples are quite different. The low Ts sample possesses strong free 
and acceptor-bound excitons, and relatively weaker and sharper emissions in the deep level range of 
1.4–1.5 eV, characteristic of high quality single crystalline CdTe [18]. The high Ts sample has a dull FE 
feature only, a stronger donor-bound exciton like feature associated with structural defects, strong defect-
related E and F lines and a deep 1.44 eV broad band [18]. Previous TEM observations had shown that 
high Ts CdTe films contain a high density of dislocations [17]. The above PL features from the high Ts 
CdTe film have been associated with structural defects or impurity-defect complexes [17, 18]. The pre-
sent study shows that the impurity involved in these complexes should be mainly indium. 
 CdTe is well lattice matched with InSb. The lattice constant for CdTe, a(CdTe), is 0.6486 nm or 
0.6482 nm at room temperature (RT) [14]. The a(InSb) lattice constant is 0.6479 nm [18]. The difference 
between them is 0.1% or 0.04% with the lattice constant of a(CdTe) being slightly higher than that of 
a(InSb). The linear thermal expansion coefficient α of InSb is about 5.5 × 10–6/K between 10 °C and 
60 °C, while α(CdTe) = (4.70–4.90) × 10–6/K at 283 K which is lower than the value of α(InSb).

vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique, including their optical properties, photon emission mechanisms, and structural 
properties. We focus on two InGaN/GaN MQW LED structures on sapphire; one is designed for blue LED and the other 
is for green LED. Analytical techniques of photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE), high-
resolution (HR) X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been employed to 
investigate their optical and structural properties.

High quality InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs were grown on (0001)-plane (c-face) sapphire substrate by low pressure (LP) 
MOCVD using an Emcore system with the vertical growth configuration and a high speed rotation disk, i.e. the so-
called Turbo-disc technology. Trimethylgallium (TMGa), Trimethylindium (TMIn), and ammonia NH3 were used as 
precursors for Ga, In, and N, respectively. The carrier gas was H2 and N2, respectively, for the growth of GaN and 
InGaN. For the growth procedures, the substrates are initially treated in H2 ambient at 1173oC. In order to relieve the 
lattice mismatch strain between GaN and sapphire substrate, 30 nm thick GaN buffer layer was grown on basal c-plane 
sapphire substrate at 520oC prior to the growth of 2 µm thick high temperature (HT, 1020oC) grown GaN. Followed, the 
temperature was lowered to 800oC to grow 800 nm InGaN layer and five or eight periods of InGaN/GaN quantum wells. 
Different designed MQW structures lead to different color LEDs. Two MQW LED wafers were involved in this study. 
A blue one (G429) consists of eight-period QWs with 3-nm InGaN wells and 10-nm-thick GaN barriers, while another 
green one (G978) has five-period QWs with 4-nm InGaN wells and 40-nm-thick GaN barriers. Afterwards, 50 nm p-
type AlGaN and 150 nm GaN cap layer were grown at high temperature. The average indium concentration in the well 
is about 15% and 18 %, respectively, and all the layers are undoped.  
The specimens for TEM observation were mechanically polished into a wedge shape using a Tripod polisher, followed 
by Ar+ ion milled at 5.0 kV to electron transparency in a Gatan Model 691 precision ion polishing system (PIPS). The 
prepared TEM specimen was examined using a Philips Tecnai F30 field-emission-gun electron microscope, equipped 
with a dark-field annular detector, operated at 300kV. 
HR-XRD analysis determines the indium composition and structural parameters of these LED. Excitation-power 
dependent PL and temperature-dependent PL, and PLE experiments were performed to investigate their optical 
characteristics. Their temperature and excitation power dependence of the optical behaviors including PL line shapes 
and the internal quantum efficiencies showed the distinct features. The recombination mechanisms were revealed and 
discussed based on the theory of the quantum confined Stark effect and carrier localization effect. This result should be 
emphasized in designing InGaN/GaN based devices.

(b) the corresponding modulated PL spectra. 
Figure 4 (a) shows the experiment temperature (T)-dependent PL spectra of the 8-QWs sample in the range from 9 K to 
room temperature (RT). Multiple fine structures were observed due to Fabry-Perot interference fringes (thickness effect) 
as previously reported results [15]. This confirms that the sample (G429) has a very smooth surface. In order to see the 
peaks clearly, attempts were made to remove the thickness fringes by dividing the spectra by an interference function 
calculated using a model for the propagation of light generated in an active layer sandwiched by two heterostructures 
[16]. For these calculations the refractive indices were obtained from [17] (and adjusted to the temperature of 
measurement), and the InGaN absorption coefficient, α(E), was represented by the sigmoidal function described in [18]. 
The linear dependencies of the effective energy gap and absorption edge broadening on the emission energy [18] enable 
an estimation of α(E) for the quantum well material in this sample. The interference function is mainly dependent on the 
overall thickness of III-N material, which is estimated using ex situ reflectometry and cross-sectional scanning electron 
microscopy. However, this method is too complicated to achieve, so we use more simple way to remove the fringes 
carefully by the smoothing function of the Origin program.  
Figure 4 (b) gives the modulated PL spectra for the 8-QWs blue sample in the temperature range from 9 to 300 K. In 
each case, the excitation power was fixed at ~23 mW. At the low temperature of 9 K, two InGaN-related emission peaks 
are clearly seen at about 2.63 eV (blue) and 3.2 (UV), which were labeled P1 and P2, respectively. The blue InGaN-
related peak (P1) shows a very bright blue light emission even at 300 K, and the luminescence intensity of the P1 
emission is reduced by only a factor of ~2.2, more less than one order of magnitude, with increasing temperature from 9 
to 300 K, indicating high quantum efficiency and good device performance of this InGaN/GaN MQW structure. On the 
other hand, the luminescence intensity from the InGaN-related UV emission peak (P2) is rapidly quenched from 15 to 
70 K. At the temperature of 70 K, another emission peak (P3) was observed clearly along with the emission peak P2. By 
increasing temperature above 90 K, the emission peak P2 is reduced quickly and exists only as a shoulder. As the 
temperature is further increased to 300 K, the two emission band P2 and P3 disappear and only P1 emission exists at 
room temperature.  
As the temperature increases, the peak P2 and P3 show monotonous red-shift clearly. However, the peak P1 red-shifts 
slightly toward the lower energy side up to 50 K, and then blue-shifts to higher energy side with increasing the 
temperature. The anomalous temperature dependence of emission shift is rarely seen in literatures. This conforms that 
the three peaks correspond to different luminescence centers or different recombination mechanisms. The red-shift trend 
of the two high-energy peaks (P2 and P3) is mainly due to the band gap shrinkage with increasing temperature. It is 
believed that P2 and P3 emissions were the MQW-related emissions. The red-blue-shift behavior of the low-energy 
peak P1 was explained by the localized character of the radiative electron-hole recombination. The excitons are trapped 
at small potential minima and gradually increase energy with temperature. The blue-shift behavior which occurs up to

LED structure in the temperature range from 9 to 300 K. 
Figure 7. Temperature dependence of the peak position (a) and 
the FWHM (b) for the InGaN/GaN 5-QWs green LED structure.
Figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of the normalized integrated PL intensity in Arrhenius plot for the 
InGaN/GaN 5-QWs green LED structure. The integrated PL intensity falls gradually with increasing temperature due to 
increasing nonradiative recombination path. Assuming that the internal 
quantum efficiency (ηint) equals unity at 9 K, we obtain ηint of 0.29 at 
room temperature. Furthermore, it appears that the data cannot be well 
fitted by an Arrhenius formula: I(T)=I0/[1+αexp(-EA/kBT)]. Instead, the 
relationship is similar to that used for amorphous semiconductors and 
disordered superlattices [26]: I(T)=I0/[1+Aexp(T/T0)], where I(T) is the 
PL intensity at the temperature T, T0 the characteristic temperature 
corresponding to the energy depth of localized states from a mobility 
edge. A is the tunneling factor and I0 is the luminescence intensity at 
the low-temperature limit. The latter equation is valid if localized band-
tail states exist [27]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to infer that the PL 
signal in the InGaN QWs comes from localized states.

4.4. Excitation-power-dependent Photoluminescence of InGaN/GaN Green LED wafer 
To further investigate the luminescence mechanism, the excitation power-dependent PL measurement was carried out. 
Figure 9 describes the excitation power dependence of PL spectra of the 5-QWs green LED sample. With increasing the 
excitation power from 0.07 to 33.1 mW, the emission shows a clear blue-shift. Figure 10 shows the excitation power 
dependence of the emission peak energy in (a) and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in (b) of the main emission, 
respectively. A blue-shift of ~163 meV for the QW peak is evident in Fig. 10 (a) as the excitation power increases from 
0.07 mW to 33.1 mW. For the blue-shift of emission energy in this sample, normally, there are two possible 
explanations. One refers to the piezoelectric field-induced QCSE [28], and another is related to the band-filling effect at 
the self-organized small In-rich regions [29]. In addition, in Fig. 10 (b) the FWHM of the emission peak decreases with 
increasing excitation power from 0.07 to 3.2 mW, and then increases with increasing excitation power up to 33.1 mW. 
Such anomalous excitation power dependence of the emission linewidth behavior is rarely seen in literatures, but 
monotonous increasing or decreasing phenomena of the emission peak linewidth for InGaN/GaN QW structure were 
observed by another group [30]. Our results can be well explained in the terms of the QCSE along with the state filling

Figure 11 shows PL and PLE spectra of two InGaN/GaN MQW blue and green LED structures at room temperature. In 
both cases, the most efficient excitation of the QW luminescence is achieved via the GaN barriers at energies above 3.5 
eV, due to the fact that at most a few percent of the exciting light is directly absorbed in the quantum well. The high 
quality of the GaN layers can be inferred from the narrow excitonic absorption peak at the GaN absorption edge. To be 
different in these cases, the blue LED sample seems to have two absorption edges, while the green one has only one 
absorption edge below the GaN absorption peak. The absorption band edges correspond to InGaN QW emission for the 
two samples show distinct distribution. We fit these PLE data by Gaussian function [33]: exp[-(E-E0)2/ 2σ2], where σ is 
the broadening parameter of the Gaussian. The broadening parameter σ of the green LED is calculated to be 806.5 meV, 
which is also ~1.8 times larger than that of blue LED. Correspondingly, the PL linewidth of the green LED (430 meV) 
is ~1.7 times larger than blue LED (260 meV). This is because the green LED has higher degree of indium fluctuations 
than blue LED. As a result, the explicit character of disorder in particular cases strongly depends on the growth 
conditions used. This suggests that the indium fluctuation and carrier localization strongly depends on the growth 
conditions of InGaN active layers.

Figure 12. HRTEM and HAADF STEM images of a V-defect region from a MQW green LED. 
Figure 12 (a) shows a HRTEM image of a V-defect region from a MOCVD-grown InGaN-GaN MQW green LED on 
sapphire. It exhibits the threading dislocation originating from GaN/sapphire interface to disrupt the InGaN/GaN MQW, 
and to initiate the V-defect, which have inverted the hexagonal pyramid-shaped {10-11} side walls. Its Cross sectional 
HAADF STEM image can be seen from the right figure (b). From these two figures, we can conclude that the sidewall 
would be thin InGaN layers on the {10-11} planes, where InGaN and GaN layers were epitaxially grown successively, 
similar to the growth on the (0001) plane. The InGaN QWs on the pyramid planes have similar thickness as the QWs on 
the (0001) planes. However the inclined GaN barriers have a thinner thickness compared in the (0001) QWs. When the 
QWs are capped with either GaN or AlGaN, the V-defects are filled with GaN (or AlGaN) and the central TD 
propagates to the free surface. The angle between the (0001) plane and the InGaN well of the left side and right side is 
different. This phenomenon changes the period thickness of the superlattice (well + barrier) within the MQWs, and it 
would have a influence on the optical properties of InGaN/GaN MQWs. 
5.2. TEM digital analysis of lattice images (DALI)  
A so-called digital analysis of lattice images (DALI) technique from cross-section HR-TEM can be performed in order 
to reveal the QW layer, thickness, indium composition, and well-to-well inhomogeneity. To avoid specimen 
degradation during electron-beam irradiation, the exposure time before image recording was kept smaller than 1 min
