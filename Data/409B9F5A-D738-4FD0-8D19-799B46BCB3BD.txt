Introduction 
White organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) have attracted great attention because of their 
low production cost and their use in such applications in flat-panel displays, backlit 
liquid-crystal displays, and solid-state lighting. OLEDs are current-driven devices. For lighting 
applications, WOLEDs must provide high brightness (>800 cd/m2), which has typically been 
associated with a high driving current density that decreases the operational lifetime. This 
obstacle can be overcome through the use of a tandem structure [1-10], in which two or more 
electroluminescence (EL) units are joined together through connecting units in series. The 
external quantum efficiency (EQE), brightness, and operational lifetime increase almost 
proportionally with respect to the number of linking EL units. Two main aspects affect the 
performance of a tandem WOLED: the nature of the effective connecting layer between EL 
units and the structure of each high-performance single EL unit. 
The connection unit typically comprises an n-type and a p-type layer. It must have high 
transmittance over the range 400–800 nm (to minimize loss of the device’s out-coupling 
efficiency) and the ability to generate charge [11-13] and to allow the generated electrons and 
holes to smoothly inject to the adjacent organic layers; preferably, it should be readily 
fabricated. The n-type layer of the connection unit is commonly a metal-doped organic layer, 
such as Li, Mg, or Cs doped with an electron transport material [9-12,14-16] [e.g., 
tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3), 2,9-dimethy-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, or 
4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline]; the relative p-type layer is usually a metal oxide materialref. 
(e.g., MoO3 [12,14,15,17], V2O5 [18], WO3 [8,19]). 
Of the several tandem WOLED structures that have been reported, most have been 
fabricated by stacking pairs of single-color EL units that emit complementary spectra, which 
together provide white light [16,17,20]. Alternatively, tandem WOLEDs can be fabricated by 
stacking two identical white EL units, where each has a multilayer-emitting structure with two

fabricated through co-evaporation of DCJTB with the host material, TPB3; the concentrations 
(wt%) of the dopant materials were estimated from the ratio of the evaporation rates. ITO and 
LiF/Al were employed as the anode and cathode, respectively. The N-type layer of the 
connecting unit was fabricated through co-evaporation of Li with the Alq3; the concentrations 
(wt%) of Li were estimated from the ratio of the evaporation rates. MoO3 was used as the 
p-type layer of the connecting unit. As a reference, a conventional device was prepared having 
the configuration ITO/NPB (65 nm)/TPB3:x% DCJTB (30 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/LiF (0.7 nm)/Al 
(200 nm). The thickness was measured using a Dektak 150 surface profiler. The 
photoluminescence (PL) and absorption spectra were measured using a Perkin–Elmer FL LS55 
fluorescence spectrophotometer and a Perkin–Elmer Lambda35 UV–Vis spectrometer, 
respectively. The energy levels were determined using a Riken KeiKi AC-2 photoelectron 
spectrometer. The EL spectra and Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates 
of the devices were measured using a PR650 spectrometer. The fluorescence quantum yield 
was measured using a Hamamatsu C9920-02 absolute PL quantum yield measurement 
system. The luminance–current density–voltage characteristics were recorded simultaneously 
with the EL spectra by combining the spectrometer with a Keithley 2400 programmable 
voltage–current source after the devices had been sealed in a N2-filled glove box. All 
measurements were recorded at room temperature under ambient conditions. The active area of 
the device was 3 mm2. 
 
Results and Discussion 
To fabricate efficient WOLEDs, the host and dopants must be efficient emitters; our system 
featured TPB3, one of the most efficient host emitters known (fluorescence quantum efficiency: 
0.8). Figure 1(b) presents energy level diagrams for our doping system. The energy levels of 
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
(LUMO) of the red dopant, DCJTB, are sandwiched between those of TPB3; because a large 
 6
at 11 V, a maximum current efficiency of 4.84 cd/A at 10 V, and a maximum power efficiency 
of 3.35 lm/W at 3 V. 
To promote the performance at a low driving current density, we prepared tandem 
WOLEDs featuring multiple EL units connected in series. Here, we used Li-doped Alq3/MoO3 
as an effective connecting unit because the inexpensive metal oxide possesses hole 
transporting ability and is readily deposited through thermal evaporation; in addition, n-type 
layers featuring electron transporting materials doped with reactive metals as the connecting 
unit enhance the charge generation probability with a increased charge carrier density [3]. 
Figure 5 presents schematic representations of the conventional and tandem structures with 
optimized values of the thickness of the connecting layer and the concentration ratio of Li. One 
of the major problems associated with tandem OLEDs is the microcavity effect arising from 
the stacking of many layered thin films and the presence of a semi-transparent (or 
partial-reflecting) connecting unit. Figure 6 displays the transmittance of our connecting unit; 
the Alq3:Li (24%) (20 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm) bilayer thin film was highly transparent, with 
approximately 75–90% transparency within the visible region (400–700 nm). For the 
corresponding WOLED, we employed a symmetric configuration in which the highly 
transparent interconnecting unit was combined with two single-emission, high-performance 
EL units. We did not expect to observe strong optical interference in this tandem device, which 
had the structure ITO/NPB (65 nm)/TPB3:DCJTB (0.5%) (30 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/Alq3:Li (24%) 
(20 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/NPB (65 nm)/TPB3:DCJTB (0.5%) (30 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/LiF (0.7 
nm)/Al (200 nm). 
The luminance–current density [Figure 7(a)] and current efficiency–current density 
[Figure 7(b)] plots reveal that the device performance of the tandem WOLED was remarkably 
improved relative to that of the conventional device. For instance, the current density required 
for a luminance of 100 cd/m2 (a typical brightness for display applications) was only 1.1 
mA/cm2, less than half of that required for the conventional single-emitting-unit device (2.3
