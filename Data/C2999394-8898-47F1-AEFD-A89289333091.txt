Abstract 
Due to the development of network technology, the applications in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have 
become more and more important. In the past few years, many excellent studies on P2P network schemes 
have been published and this field has been triggered by applications in domains as file sharing, distribution 
computing, instant communication, and so on. According to the above statement, we shall propose efficient, 
practical, and secure P2P networks. 
In the related researches, the researchers consider the security issues are the important factor need to be 
addressed in P2P networks. These are security of distributed computing and a trusted P2P network. In order to 
prevent the malicious attacks such as replay attacks and impersonating attacks etc., some authentication 
mechanisms and encryption methods are used to this work. And we also consider that protect the user privacy 
in P2P network. 
In order to achieve secure P2P network networks, we have to solve two important issues. One is how to 
maintain the trusted P2P network systems, and another is how to prevent the free riders problem. In this 
project, we have constructed a trust P2P network system. In our system, the requester could download the file 
from the responder if s/he has high reputation value.

the relevance of our work. In Section 3, we proposed a trusted P2P network systems based on reputation and 
contribution values. We simulate our proposed method and discuss in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 contains 
our conclusion. 
2 Related Works 
In recent years, a number of reputation systems have been proposed for different networks by different 
researchers [5, 13, 15, 20, 22]. 
In a structured P2P network, the reputation models that have been proposed include EigenTrust [13], 
PeerTrust [20], PowerTrust [22], Hubs controlling [15], etc. 
EigenTrust assigns each peer a global reputation value based on its history iteration. PeerTrust identifies 
five factors for evaluation: (1)feedback; (2)feedback scope; (3) credibility factor for the feedback source; 
(4)transaction context factor; (5)community context factor. PeerTrust combines these factors by a general 
trust measurement. PowerTrust also collects feedback on local peers and combines them into global reputation 
scores. PowerTrust considers the distribution of peer feedbacks, and uses a TON to construct the trust 
relationships among peers. 
In 2010, Liu et al.’s proposed a method for controlling hubs in a wireless P2P network based on trust 
values [15]. In their model, they considered an initiator obtain better quality service if a responding node has a 
high trust value and low connections. The general trust value of a responding node is computed by the direct 
trust value and recommendation value provided by other nodes. The initiator chooses a responder with the 
highest general trust value to create this communication. However, this model only guarantees initiators could 
get better QoS and prevents downloading from a malicious peer. The responders do not have the rights to 
decide whether initiators should be allowed to download the resource. 
In an unstructured P2P network, Zhou et al. proposed a GossipTrust method in 2008 [23]. They used a 
lightweight aggregation and rapidly updated reputation of global values. Dewan and Dasgupta used 
distributed identities and decentralized recommendation chaining to manage P2P reputation. [5] In the P2P 
network, all peers are identified by identity certificates generated by self-certification. When a requester 
requests a resource for providers, he first collects the latest transaction identification (TID) of providers. Then 
he requests reputation chains from providers and decides on the provider with the best reputation. After the 
transaction, the requester will give feedback on the reputation value and add to this recommendation chaining 
to the provider. This method can be used in structured and unstructured P2P networks. 
There are some drawbacks to Dewan and Dasgqpta’s model. First, we cannot know the initial reputation 
value. In Addition, if the latest reputation value of a legitimate user is given by a malicious user, the user 
might become a malicious user. In other words, malicious users can ensnare legitimate users. The other 
drawback is a requester should collect the latest transaction identification to confirm that the TID in this 
transaction is not repeated. However, real P2P networks they are high churn networks, meaning there are 
many peers who will join and leave at any time. 
The reputation value of a peer in a P2P network is dynamic and usually changes over time, but most 
reputation models cannot achieve this property. The reputation value is an important target to let us know the

3.2 Free Rider Decision 
The responders have the item Cm(x) requested by requester j, to prevent free riders in P2P networks. The 
responders would check and decide whether to give the right to download to the requester. 
A Responder r first checks dTj and rdj of a requester j. There are three cases to help r to decide. 
1. Both of values equal 0 or dTj do not equal 0 and rdj equals 0: When both values are equal 0, it means peer 
j has never shared any transaction with r, and r will consider j is not a free rider and transmit a Pong 
message to notify he is the file owner. dTj is not equal 0 and rdj equals to 0 means that r has been 
downloaded the items from j but r has not been upload items to j. Thus, r will consider that j is not a free 
right and give the download right to j. 
2. dTj equals 0 and rdj is not equal 0: The requester r checks whether the value of rdj is greater than a 
threshold t. If rdj is less than t1, r will think j is a free rider and not transmit the Pong message to notify 
he is the file owner. Otherwise, r will transmit the Pong message to let j know he is the owner of Cm(x). 
3. Neither value equals 0: j is not always downloads item from other peers, h/she sometimes responds to 
other requesters. In this case, r will make the decision by the following equation: 
                    ,
jj
j
j
rddT
dT
FR

                             (1) 
where FRj is the probability of free rider by j. If rdj is less than t1 and FRj is greater than the threshold t2, 
r will consider j is not a free rider and transmit Pong message to j. Otherwise, r will not return the Pong 
message. 
3.3 Responder Decision 
3.3.1 Local Reputation Value 
In this section we introduce the computation method of the local reputation values of the responders 
when a requester i receives a set of responders after requesting item x. The local reputation value LRj of peer j 
is computed by the reputation table: Rj, Tj, and bTj using the following equation. 
                 ,
j
jj
jj
T
bTT
RLR

                             (2) 
where Rj is the reputation value of j, and 
j
jj
T
bTT  is the ratio of the success times of the transaction. Rj is a direct 
value that i observes j by the transactions. If i never transacts with j, the Rj and LRj will be 0.5.  
In initial, we consider that a peer may not a malicious peer, but s/he responds a bad item to requester. 
Thus, if the ratio of bad transactions to total transactions is 1, we compute the local reputation  jj RL
where  is a weight value. 
3.3.2 Global Reputation Value 
Besides the local reputation value, requester i also asks set neighbors to obtain the recommendation 
values of peer j. We collect these values and compute the global reputation value of j, GRj . Peer i asks a 
number of neighbors the reputation value of responder j, and the item reputation value of x provided by j.

equals 5. In Figure 1, we can see the free riders could not download any item after approximately 1700 
rounds. 
Figure 2 shows at progressively decrease in the number of free riders. The free riders decrease very 
quickly after about 1000 rounds. 
In the second experiment, we simulate case 3 of the free riders and evaluate the effectiveness. In this 
experiment, we set 20%-30% free riders, and the free riders download items from the top 10% popular peers. 
The probability of responding in free riders to these is 0.05. In initiation, free riders will respond to peers who 
request free riders in first time, t1 equals 5, and t2 is 0.2. In each round, there at least half of requesters are free 
riders. In Figure 3, we can detect 20% free riders after about 7000 rounds and we can detect 30% free riders 
after about 9000 rounds. 
5 Conclusion 
There are many inherent advantages to P2P systems, such as resource sharing and rapid searching. We 
focused on maintaining trust and preventing free riders in the P2P network system. In this project, a trust 
protocol based on reputation and contribution values was proposed.
