Abstract 
In this project, two plates of aluminum alloy AA1050 were Friction Stir Welding (FSW) in the 
butt joint. In the FSW procedure, there were four mainly controllable four-level factors, i.e., the tool 
rotation speed, transverse speed (feed rate), tool tilt angle with respect to the workpiece surface and 
pin tool length. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is the statistic method used to interpret these 
experimental data. Taguchi technique with ANOVA is used to find out the significant variables 
(factors) for the ultimate tensile strength and elongation rate measuring with the noise performance. 
Finally, the effects of the ultimate tensile strength and the elongation rate are combined by fuzzy 
logic to be one performance index so called multiple performance characteristics index (MPCI). The 
MPCI measurement is regarded as the entirely optimal quality of welded aluminum alloy butt joint. 
Totally, there are four papers, two SCI/EI journal papers and two conference papers, produced 
from this project so far. Please refer these details in the last page.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relative new material joining technique invented [1] by the 
welding Institute (TWI) in 1991, which can produce superior mechanical properties in the weld zone. 
In recent years, FSW has become one of the most important solid-state joining processes. The FSW 
process is shown schematically in Fig. 1 [2]. 
In FSW process as shown in Fig. 1, the heat is generated between the wear resistant welding 
tool and the material of the workpieces. The heat causes the latter to soften without reaching the 
melting point and allows traveling of the tool along the welding line. Comparing the moving velocity 
of the tool and the heat traveling time for soften temperature, the optimal tool moving velocity was 
provided by [3]. The controllable parameters for FSW processing are not only the moving tool 
velocity [4] but also the rotation speed of the tool, length of the tool pin, tool tilt angle with respect to 
the workpiece surface, stirrer geometry and so on. 
Taguchi technique for the experimental data analysis is a common method using in 
conventional welding [5-6], but not in FSW. The fuzzy logic in Taguchi technique for the 
experimental data analysis is a relative new method applied to conventional welding [7]. However,

Table 3 are calculated. Additionally, combine all of signal to noise ratios from uncontrollable factors 
to only one performance (MPCI) as shown in Table 3, which is based on fuzzy logic in the next 
section 3.2. 
The desired characteristic of uncontrollable factors for the response can be measured by signal 
to noise ratio (SN). Based on the use of Taguchi’s recommendation [8-9], signal to noise ratio for 
ultimate tensile strength or elongation rate is the larger the better.  
3.2 Fuzzy Logic 
Fuzzy logic [10-11], which is the logic on which fuzzy control is based, is much closer in spirit 
to human thinking and natural language than the traditional logical systems. The basic configuration 
of a fuzzy control system comprises four principal components: (1) a fuzzifier, (2) a fuzzy rule base, 
(3) a fuzzy inference engine, and (4) a defuzzifier.  Each components are described as following: 
(1) The fuzzifier converts input data into suitable linguistic values which may be viewed as labels 
of fuzzy sets [14]. The fuzzy set A is characterized by the membership function with the three 
levels (S, M and L for small, medium and large, respectively) of input data. In this work, the 
membership functions are defined for input data of the ultimate tensile strength (SN1) and the 
elongation rate (SN2).  
(2) The fuzzy rule base consists of a collection of IF-THEN rules. The rules are used to describe 
the relationships of the system’s input and output. Typically, in the case of Mamdani 
linguistic statements [10-11], it can be expressed as: 
Rule : if  is  and …. and  is  , then y is , where  and , with 
, are the fuzzy sets of  and y used in the th control rule, respectively. 
i ix iA nx nA iB iA iB
ni .....2,1= ix i
(3) The fuzzy inference engine based on fuzzy logic principles is used to combine fuzzy 
IF-THEN rules from the fuzzy rule base into a mapping from fuzzy input sets to fuzzy output 
sets. Several inferences can be found in the literature for this process similarly in spirit to 
human thinking and natural language. The pioneering and common method is proposed by 
Mamdani [10-11].  
(4) The defuzzier is a mapping from a space of fuzzy control actions into a space of nonfuzzy 
control actions which is the best representation of the possibility distribution of an inferred 
fuzzy control action. There is no systematic procedure for choosing a defuzzification strategy. 
The widely used for defuzzification strategy is the center of gravity of the possibility 
distribution of a control action [10]. The fuzzy set A representing the output data is 
characterized by the membership function with the five levels (VS, S, M, L and VL for very 
small, small, medium, large and very large, respectively) of output data. In this work, the 
membership function is defined for MPCI. 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
In this work, there are four mainly controllable factors, i.e., four-level rotation speed 
(550/1100/1250/1800 rpm), transverse speed (53/90/143/180 mm/min), tool tiled angle (1/2/3/4 
degree) and pin tool length (2.5/2.7/2.9/3.1 mm), as shown in Table 1, for analysis of variance. Their 
interactions are possible to be computed from above experimental data for analysis of variance. In 
 3
significant factors can be identified from the values of their F ratios.  The significant factors for 
MPCI, corresponding to at least 99% confidence, are rotation speed (P = 11.44), transverse speed (P 
= 13.22), tool tiled angle (P = 39.12) and pin tool length (P = 10.49). It is noted that tool tiled angle 
(P = 39.12) is the most significant factor.  
The most significant factor by according to percent contribution is the tool tiled angle for both 
the cases of the MPCI. Furthermore, The sequentially significant factors by according to percent 
contribution for the MPCI case is CBAD, which is the tool tiled angle C, transverse speed B, rotation 
speed A and pin tool length D. The residual (error) contributions, which are the summary of 
contributions including all of factors and their interaction, but excluding factors ABCD themselves, 
is 25.74% for the MPCI case. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
The main objective of this paper is by using fuzzy logic in Taguchi method OA16 (44) for 
ANOVA to study an optimal combination of a set of controllable FSW process parameters for the 
optimal quality of the AA1050 aluminum alloy butt joint. In this work, there are four mainly 
controllable parameters, i.e., four-level rotation speed (550/1100/1250/1800 rpm), transverse speed 
(53/90/143/180 mm/min), tool tiled angle (1/2/3/4 degree) and pin tool length (2.5/2.7/2.9/3.1 mm). 
The optimally welded quality of butt joint, corresponding to at least 99% confidence, is defined by 
according to ultimate tensile strength the larger the better and elongation rate the larger the better 
respectively. Finally, the effects of the ultimate tensile strength and the elongation rate are combined 
by fuzzy logic to be MPCI. In this work, the MPCI measurement is regarded as the entirely optimal 
quality of welded butt joint. Based on the above discussions, the following conclusions can be made. 
(a) The most significant factor by according to percent contribution is the tool tiled angle for the 
MPCI case of the AA1050 aluminum alloy butt joint. 
(b) The optimally welded quality of performance, by according to the MPCI, for the AA1050 
aluminum alloys butt joint is produced by the combination of the rotation speed 1250 
rpm/transverse speed 53 mm/min /tool tiled angle 1or 2 degree/pin tool length 2.9 or 3.1 mm.  
(c) The sequentially significant factors for the MPCI case are the tool tiled angle, transverse 
speed, rotation speed and pin tool length.  
(d) The residual (error) contribution, which is the summary of contribution including all of 
factors and their interaction, but excluding factors in this work themselves, is about 26% only.
