Abstract                               
Several strategies have been made to minimize intermolecular interactions of 
polyfluorenes, such as longer and branched side chains or bulky substituents, 
copolymerization techniques, dendrimer attachment, end-capping with bulky groups, 
cross-linking, oligomer and hyperbranched structure approaches. Among them 
hyperbranched structures are one of the most versatile and promising ways to develop 
electroluminescent polymers with diminished intermolecular interactions and added 
functional groups. In this dissertation, we synthesized a series of totally new tri-functional 
branching monomers for the preparation of copolyfluorenes, such as 3,4,5-tris(4-bromo- 
phenyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole (A), 3-(3,5-dibromophenyl)-5- (4-bromophenyl)-4-(4-(hexyloxy) 
phenyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole (B), 2,4,7-tris(bromo- methyl)-9,9-dihexyl-fluorene (D), 2,4,7- 
tris[methylene(triphenyl-phosphonium bromide)]-9,9-dihexylfluorene (E) and 2-bromo- 
5,7-divinyl-9,9-dihexylfluorene (F). Furthermore, the corresponding bi-functional 
monomers: 3-(3-bromophenyl)-5-(4-bromophenyl)-4-(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)-4H-1,2,4- 
triazole (C), 2,7-bis(bromomethyl)-9,9-dihexylfluorene (D’), 2,7-bis[methylene(triphenyl- 
phosphonium bromide)]-9,9-dihexylfluorene (E’) and 2-bromo-7-vinyl-9,9- dihexylfluorene 
(F’) were also synthesized for the preparation of model linear polyfluorenes. All 
hyperbranched polymers were synthesized conveniently via a one-step polymerization by A3 
+ A’2 + B2, A3 + B2, A3, and AB2 approaches. All monomers and polymers were identified 
by 1H NMR, FT-IR and elemental analysis. The thermal properties of these polymers were 
analyzed with thermogravimetric analysis. The optical, electrochemical and 
electroluminescent properties of these polymers were investigated in detail to elucidate the 
branched structure-property relationship. 
In chapters 4~5, in order to suppress the interchain interaction, hyperbranched 
polyfluorenes HPFA (4%~22%) and HPFB (5%~13%) were polymerized by an A3 + A’2 
+ B2 approach via Suzuki coupling reaction. These polymers contain A (4~22 mol%) and B 
(4.8~13.3 mol%) as branch units. Model linear polyfluorenes LPFA0%, LPFB0% and 
LPFC (4%~13%) were also prepared for comparative studies. The hyperbranched polymers 
showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as CHCl3, toluene, and CH2Cl2 
and exhibited excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures higher than 
432oC. From optical absorption analysis, an interesting linear relationship between 1/λmax 
and 1/(1-ntriazole) were correlated for both HPFAs (4%~22%) and HPFBs (5%~13%), 
which was not observed in linear LPFC (4%~13%). The hyperbranched structures of 
HPFA4%~HPFA22% and HPFB13% suppress detrimental excimer formation (~550 nm) 
effectively during thermal annealing process. For HPFA6%~HPFA22%, however, a novel 
PL emission (~520 nm) was appeared after thermal annealing that had been attributed to 
complexes formed between triazole and pendant carbazole chromophores. The maximal

In fact, advancements in semi-conducting polymers have progressed steadily, since 
their discovery in 1977 by Heeger et al. at the University of Pennsylvania [5]. 
Poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) has been one of the most studied polymers. These facts led 
to the discovery in 1990 by the Cambridge group in England that it was possible to use PPV 
as the emitting element in a polymer-based LED (the device architecture: ITO/PPV/Al) [6]. 
The first PLED device architecture is shown as Figure 1-1-3-(a). Figure 1-1-3-(b) depicts the 
mechanism of electroluminescence as four steps: (1) carriers injection, (2) carriers transport, 
(3) formation of excitons, (4) radiatve deactivation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1-1-3. (a) The first PLED devices architecture; (b) electroluminescent mechanism.  
 
Conjugated polymer-based electroluminescence drew a lot of attraction due to their 
semi-conducting properties by having delocalized electron along the polymer chain and the 
π and π* orbitals form delocalized valence and conduction wavefunctions, which support 
mobile charge carriers [7]. The PL and the EL spectra are consistent, indicating that the 
emitting species are the same when excited by light or electric current. This was a 
breakthrough improvement since it made it possible to combine the good mechanical and 
processing properties of polymers with semi-conducting behavior. 
Now the red, green, and blue electroluminescent organic materials and full color 
displays are available. Although the commercial products will be developed gradually, but 
there are still some important issues or problems (ex. material property, device physical) 
need to overcome. Generally, the comparison of electroluminescent polymer vs. small

1-2 Common Polymerization for Electroluminescent Polymers [8]

promote polymerization [9].  
(b) The McCullough Method (Figure 1-2-1) 
      The polymerization is catalyzed by a nickel catalyst, such as Ni(dppf)2Cl2 
dichloro[1,1’-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]nickel(II). The overall reaction is 
controlled by the metal site to give stereoregular structures [10]. 
(c) The Heck Reaction (Figure 1-2-1) [11] 
        The Heck reaction is a palladium-catalyzed vinylation of organic halides, which 
leads to the formation of C-C double bonds in mostly trans configuration with very few 
side reaction by using palladium acetate, PdCl2, Pd(dba)2 (dibenzylideneacetate 
palladium), Pd(PPh3)4. The regioselectivity of Heck-type coupling can be controlled by 
the reaction condition, the leaving groups, the substituents on the arylene component, 
and the choice of the olefinic monomers [12]. Depending on the substituents, more than 
1% of 1,1-diarylations can be observed. In the synthesis of oligophenylenevinylene, cis 
and trans mixtures can be obtained, and all-trans structure can be obtained by addition 
of a catalytic amount of iodine [13]. 
(d) The Suzuki Reaction (Figure 1-2-1) 
      The Suzuki reaction refers to the cross coupling of aryl or vinylic halides (or 
triflates) with organoboron regents by using a Pd(0) catalyst has been widely used for 
the synthesis of substituted PPPs and some PPVs [14]. The most commomly used 
palladium catalysts are Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, and Pd(OAc)2 with 
triphenylphosphine. The Suzuki reaction has the advantages of being tolerant of a large 
variety of functional groups and is insensitive to water. Recently, it was reported that 
with the addition of a phase transfer catalyst (tetrabutylammonium bromide), the 
reaction time could be shortened to 24 h with the temperature lowered to 75 , as ℃
compared to the typical condition of 85  for three days, and the molecular weight ℃
could be improved to over 100,000, provided that the monomers are purified carefully 
[15]. Soluble PPP derivatives prepared via coupling reactions using the Yamamoto or 
Suzuki routes yielded significant torsion angles. The inter-ring twisting significantly 
changes the electronic structure as well as the conjugation length [16]. 
(e) The Stille Coupling Reaction (Figure 1-2-1) 
      The Stille coupling reaction refers to the palladium-catalyzed coupling between an 
organostannane and an electrophile to from a new C-C bond [17]. Advantages of this 
method are that organostannanes are not oxygen or moisture sensitive and tolerant a 
wide variety of functionalities. However, organostannanes are toxic and difficult to 
purify.

straightforward preparation of the dihalogenated reactants. As compared to the 
FeCl3-catalyzed oxidative polymerization, Yamamoto coupling improves specificity 
and minimizes branching. A disadvantage of this method is that catalyst residues may 
be difficult to remove from the product. In addition, these nickel-catalyzed coupling 
reactions are not suitable for the synthesis of alternating copolymers. Recently, the 
nickel-mediated coupling of Yamamoto route [24] has been used to prepare a variety 
of fluorene and substituted fluorene homo- and copolymers [25,26].

(b) Electroluminescent Oxadiazole Derivatives 
One of the best electron transport structures is the oxadiazole group. Some examples of 
oxadiazole-containing EL polymers are given in Figure 1-3-2. Among the various examples 
found in the literature one can cite the use of oxadiazole incorporated in the main chain or as 
a pendant group [29]. In the first case the oxadiazole moiety was used as a comonomer in 
chromophoric imides, copolymers containing thiophene sequences, or in a PPV type main 
chain [30]. Oxadiazole moieties linked to PPV, alkyl-PPV, and polythiophene chains as 
pendant groups with improved EL efficiencies due to higher electron affinity, better 
injection, and transport properties have also been reported [31]. The insertion of electron 
transporting groups in p-type polymers brings about bipolar carrier transport ability. In 
Figure 1-3-3 the combination of donor-acceptor groups in side chain in was attempted to 
achieve balanced electron–hole injection and transport avoiding the use of intermediate 
transport layers has been widely explored [32].

(d) Electroluminescent Fluorene Derivatives [1] 
Although the first polymer light-emitting diodes were carried out by Burroughes et al. 
using poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s that emitted green light, but polyfluorene derivatives 
were quickly investigated by Ohmori et al. [36]. Polyfluorene derivatives are a particular 
suitable class of materials because they contain a rigid biphenyl unit which leads to a large 
band gap with efficient blue emission, and the facile substitution at the remote C9 position 
provides the possibility of improving their solubility and processability. However, these first 
experiments on polymer-based diodes that emitted blue light were carried out with 
oxidatively prepared polyfluorene derivatives. Pei and Yang used nickel-catalyzed 
Yamamoto couplings of 2,7-dibromo-9,9-substituted fluorenes to synthesize well-defined 
poly[2,7-(9,9-dialkylfluorene)]s [37]. This first report on region-regular 
poly[2,7-(9,9-dialkylfluorene)]s was rapidly followed by investigations on well-defined  
fluorene-containing conjugated polymers using palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling 
reaction between 2,7-dibromofluorene derivatives and 2,7-diboronyfluorene derivatives 
(Figure 1-3-6) [38].

Yamamoto polymerization (right). 
Unfortunately, poly[2,7-(9,9-dialkyl fluorene)]s and poly[2,7-(9-alkyl fluorene)]s 
generally show some excimer emission in the solid state that affects the color emission and 
the life time of devices. In most copolymers, excimer formation was suppressed and a fairly 
good coincidence was observed between solid-state fluorescent spectra and 
electroluminescent spectra. In addition, the development of such copolymers permitted the 
preparation of a variety of fluorene-containing copolymers that emit colors spanning the 
entire visible range (red, green, blue). Some polyfluorene derivatives exhibit thermochromic 
and solvatochromic properties. Moreover, polyfluorenes can also show unusual electrical 
properties. It is known that 9-monosubstituted fluorene derivatives bearing a strong 
electron-withdrawing substituent (ketone, benzoyl, cyano, etc.) exhibit a pKa lower than 
water, making the fluorenyl anion stable in the air. Upon deprotonation (base doping) these 
stable polyanions showed interesting electrical conductivities (Figure 1-3-7) [39].

1-4 Introduction of Hyperbranched Polymers 
1-4-1 Development Background of Hyperbranched Polymers 
About 50 years after the introduction of the ‘macromolecular hypothesis’ by Staudinger, 
the entire field of polymer science could be described as consisting of only two major 
architectural classes: (I) linear topologies as found in thermoplastics and (II) cross-linked 
architectures as found in thermosets [42]. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, four 
major domains can be defined and distinguished in accordance with their properties and 
architecture (see Figure 1-4-1): 
(I)   linear, random coil thermoplastics such as plexiglass or nylon; 
(II)   cross-linked thermosets such as rubbers or epoxies; 
(III)  branched systems based on long chain branching in polyolefins such as low density 
poly(ethylene) and other related branched topologies; 
(IV)  dendritic polymers consisting of three subsets that are based on the degree of 
structural control, namely (a) random hyperbranched polymers; (b) dendrigraft 
polymers; and (c) dendrimers. 
Due to the unique repertoire of new properties, dendritic polymers are recognized as a 
fourth major new architectural class, a class with a young but well established body of 
interdisciplinary research exploring a remarkable variety of potential applications. Apart 
from the dendritic polymers, other important branched topologies in polymer science such as 
comb and star polymers, networks, and microgels are shown in Figure 1-4-2 [42]. 
 
Figure 1-4-1. Representation of the four major classes of macromolecular architectures. 
The tedious and complex multistep-synthesis of dendrimers results in expensive 
products with limited use for large-scale industrial applications. For many applications, 
which do not require structural perfection, using hyperbranched polymers can circumvent 
this major drawback of dendrimers. Unlike dendrimers, randomly branched hyperbranched 
polymers with similar properties can be easily synthesized via one-step reactions and 
therefore represent economically promising products also for large-scale industrial 
applications [43]. As a consequence, more efficient routes to the generation of branched 
polymers that are less reliant upon complex multi-step synthetic procedures have been

dendrimers [46,56]. 
1-4-2 The General Synthesis Methodology of Hyperbranched Polymers 
    Hyperbranched polymers can be prepared by means of single monomer methodology 
(SMM) and double-monomer methodology (DMM). In SMM, the polymerization of an ABn 
or latent ABn monomer leads to hyperbranched macromolecules. In DMM, direct 
polymerization of two suitable monomers or a monomer pair gives rise to hyperbranched 
polymers. A classical example of DMM, the polymerization of A2 and Bn (n > 2) monomers, 
is well known. Recently, a novel DMM based on the in situ formation of ABn intermediates 
from specific monomer pairs has been developed. This form of DMM is designated as 
‘couple-monomer methodology’ (CMM) 
to clearly represent the method of polymerization [57]. 
    The first category contains techniques of the single-monomer methodology (SMM), 
in which hyperbranched macromolecules are synthesized by polymerization of an ABn or a 
latent ABn monomer (Figure 1-4-3). According to the reaction mechanism, the SMM 
category includes at least four specific approaches:  
(1) polycondensation of ABn monomers [58~61];  
(2) self-condensing vinyl polymerization (SCVP) [62~65];  
(3) self-condensing ring-opening polymerization (SCROP) [66~69]; 
(4) proton-transfer polymerization (PTP) [70~73].

homopolymerization of AB2 type monomers. 
   The second category contains methods of the double-monomer methodology (DMM) in 
which direct polymerization of two types of monomers or a monomer pair generates 
hyperbranched polymers. The first intentional preparation of hyperbranched polymers via

1-4-3 General Properties of Hyperbranched Polymers [82] 
    The physical properties of hyperbranched polymers are of key importance with respect 
to their implementation in industrial applications. One of the most interesting properties of 
hyperbranched polymers is their low viscosity characteristics in comparison to linear 
analogues. The viscosity of hyperbranched polymers, both in solution and in the molten state 
have been found to be considerably lower when analysed to their linear analogues [71, 83]. 
Considerations of the branched nature of the hyperbranched polymers and dendrimers can 
be used to explain this phenomenon.  
(a) Solution behavior 
Not only good solubility but also solution behavior differs for hyperbranched polymers 
compared to linear polymers. For example, hyperbranched aromatic polyesters, described by 
Turner et al. [84,85], exhibit a very low α-value in the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation 
and low intrinsic viscosities. This is consistent with highly branched and compact structures. 
Fréchet presented a comparison between linear polymers, hyperbranched polymers, and 
dendrimers with respect to intrinsic viscosities as a function of molecular weight, which 
clearly shows the differences induced by variations in the backbone architecture (Figure 
1-4-6) [86].

where the mechanical strength is of minor importance. The large amount of branching also 
makes most of these polymers amorphous although exceptions exist. Hence, these polymers 
are mainly suitable as additives or as thermosets when high mechanical strength is required 
for a certain application. 
1-4-4 Common Application of Hyperbranched Polymers 
    Most of the applications of hyperbranched polymers are based on the absence of chain 
entanglements, the globular shape, and the nature and the large number of functional groups 
within a molecule. Modification of the number and type of functional groups on 
hyperbranched polymers is essential to control their solubility, compatibility, reactivity, 
adhesion to various surfaces, self-assembly, chemical recognition, and electrochemical and 
luminescence properties. In other words, the large number of functional groups allows for 
the tailoring of their thermal, rheological, and solution properties and thus provides a 
powerful tool to design hyperbranched polymers for a wide variety of applications.  
Figure 1-4-7 gives an overview of the common applications for hyperbranched polymers 
[43].

    In Figure 1-4-10, a “A2 + A’2 + B3” approach based on Suzuki polycodensation was 
developed for the hyperbranched polymer synthesis. The polymer films exhibited very 
stable blue light emission even after being annealed in the elevated temperatures in the N2 
and air [97].

    In Figure 1-4-11, the structures and properties of the hyperbranched polymers are 
characterized and evaluated by IR, NMR, UV, PL, TGA, and optical limiting analyses. Most 
of the hb-PAs show outstanding thermal stability (Td up to 560 °C) with high weight 
residues (Wr up to 86%) after pyrolysis at 800°C. Upon photo-excitation, solutions of the 
hyperbranched polymers emit strong blue light of 400 nm with fluorescence quantum yields 
ΦF up to 90%. They show excellent optical limiting performance and strongly attenuate the 
power of 8 ns pulses of 532 nm laser light [98].

1-5 Research Motivation 
The spectral shifts (photoluminescence) from dilute solution to high concentration or 
solid state are usually observed. These shifts which do not originate from single polymeric 
chain are considered as contribution from intermolecular interactions (formation of 
aggregate, excimer or exciplex). Generally, the PF derivatives consist of planar and rigid 
structures, their main backbones are easy to stack in solid state and result in the overlap of 
conjugation, moreover, the extent of excimer formation increase with content of polar side 
chain in electric field [101]. To minimize this interaction, several attempts have been made 
to use longer and branched side chains or bulky substituents [102], copolymerization 
techniques [103], dendrimer attachment [104], end-capping of PFs with bulky groups [105], 
cross-linking of PFs [101], and oligomer approach [103,106]. In comparison to dendritic 
polymers, hyperbranched polymers are not only much easier to synthesize but also possess 
comparable ability in suppressing excimer/exciplex formation [107].  
Moreover, a hyperbranched polymer may possess many peripheral reactive groups 
when prepared by Heck coupling [108] or Wittig reaction [109]. By controlling the nature of 
the terminal groups, it is possible to endow these hyperbranched architectures with functions 
such as thermal curing and energy harvesting as well as optoelectronic characteristics. 
Therefore, hyperbranched structure is a versatile and promising strategy to develop 
electroluminescent polymers with diminished intermolecular interactions and added 
functional groups. In this work, we synthesized a series of totally new tri-functional 
branching monomers for the preparation of polyfluorenes, such as 3,4,5-tris(4-bromophenyl) 
-4H-1,2,4-triazole (A), 3-(3,5-dibromophenyl)-5- (4-bromophenyl)-4-(4-(hexyloxy)

Review and Theoretical Background 
2.1 Principle of Photoluminescence [110] 
    Photoluminescence is a process in which a chemical compound absorbs photons 
(electromagnetic radiation), thus jumping to a higher electronic energy state, and then 
radiates photons back out, returning to a lower energy state. Technically, it is “luminescence 
arising from photoexcitation” [111]. The period between absorption and emission is 
typically extremely short, in the order of 10 nanoseconds. Under special circumstances, 
however, this period can be extended into minutes or hours.Ultimately, available chemical 
energy states and allowed transitions between states (and therefore wavelengths of light 
preferentially absorbed and emitted) are determined by the rules of quantum mechanics. A 
basic understanding of the principles involved can be gained by studying the electron 
configurations and molecular orbitals of simple atoms and molecules. More complicated 
molecules and advanced subtleties are treated in the field of computational chemistry. 
    The simplest photoluminescent processes are resonant radiations, in which a photon of 
a particular wavelength is absorbed and an equivalent photon is immediately emitted. This 
process involves no significant internal energy transitions of the chemical substrate between 
absorption and emission and is extremely fast, of the order of 10 nanoseconds. 
More interesting processes occur when the chemical substrate undergoes internal energy 
transitions before re-emitting the energy from the absorption event. The most familiar such 
effect is fluorescence, which is also typically a fast process, but in which some of the 
original energy is dissipated so that the emitted light photons are of lower energy than those 
absorbed. 
Photoluminescence is an important technique for measuring the purity and crystalline 
quality of semiconductors such as GaAs and InP. Several variations of photoluminescence 
exist, including photoluminescence excitation (PLE). An even more specialized form of 
photoluminescence is phosphorescence, in which the energy from absorbed photons 
undergoes intersystem crossing into a state of higher spin multiplicity, usually a triplet state. 
Once the energy is trapped in the triplet state, transition back to the lower singlet energy 
states is quantum mechanically forbidden, meaning that it happens much more slowly than 
other transitions. The result is a slow process of radiative transition back to the singlet state, 
sometimes lasting minutes or hours. This is the basis for "glow in the dark" substances. 
    Figure 2-1-1 is a partial energy-level diagram for a typical photoluminescent molecule. 
It is important that a singlet/triplet transition (or the reverse), which also involves a change 
in electronic state, is a significantly less probable event than the corresponding 
 
 
28 
 
defined nor well understood, but it is apparent that they are often highly efficient. Internal 
conversion appears to be particularly efficient when two electronic energy levels are 
sufficiently close for there to be an overlap in vibrational energy levels. Internal conversion 
may also result in the phenomenon of predissociation that electron moves from a higher 
electronic state to an upper vibrational level of a lower electronic state in which the 
vibrational energy is great enough to cause rupture of a bond. Predissociation is different 
from dissociation, in which the absorbed radiation excites the electron of a chromophore 
directly to a sufficiently high vibrational level to cause rupture of the chromophoric bond 
and no internal conversion is involved. 
    Deactivation of an excited electronic state may involve interaction and energy transfer 
between the excited molecule and the solvent or other solutes. These processes are called 
collectively external conversion or collisional quenching. Radiationless transitions to the 
ground state from the lowest excited singlet and triplet states probably involve external 
conversion and internal conversion. 
    Intersystem crossing is a process in which the spin of an excited electron is reversed 
and a change in multiplicity of the molecule results. The singlet/triplet transition is an 
example; the lowest singlet vibration level overlaps one of the upper triplet vibrational levels 
and a change in spin state is thus more probable. Intersystem crossing is most common in 
molecules that contain heavy atoms, such as iodine or bromine (the heavy-atom effect). The 
presence of paramagnetic species such as molecular oxygen in solution also enhances 
intersystem crossing and a consequent decrease in fluorescence. 
2.2 The Quantum Yield [110] 
   The quantum yield of a radiation-induced process is the number of times that a defined 
event occurs per photon absorbed by the system. Thus, the quantum yield is a measure of the 
efficiency with which absorbed light produces some effect. For example, in a chemical 
photodegradation process, when a molecule falls apart after absorbing a light quantum, the 
quantum yield is the number of destroyed molecules divided by the number of photons 
absorbed by the system. Since not all photons are absorbed productively, the typical 
quantum yield will be less than 1. Quantum yields greater than 1 are possible for 
photo-induced or radiation-induced chain reactions, in which a single photon may trigger a 
long chain of transformations. One example is the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine, in 
which a few hundred molecules of hydrochloric acid are typically formed per quantum of 
blue light absorbed. In optical spectroscopy, the quantum yield is the probability that a given 
quantum state is formed from the system initially prepared in some other quantum state. For 
example, a singlet to triplet transition quantum yield is the fraction of molecules that, after 
being photoexcited into a singlet state, cross over to the triplet state. The fluorescence 
 
 
30 
 
chemical species if the presence of non-intentional impurities can be neglected. A molecular 
(well localized) excited state is a typical product of photoexcitation. Light absorption (hvex) 
creates excited molecular singlet (Ms*), which can relax by intersystem crossing to an 
excited molecular triplet (MT*). Their radiative decay produces fluorescence and 
phosphorescence, respectively. On the other hand, the interaction of an excited molecular 
state with a ground state molecule (M) leads to formation of locally excited excimer or 
charge-transfer excimer if the distance between molecules is shorter than 0.4 nm. If it is 
larger than 0.4 nm, we can deal with diect transition from the LUMO-located electron of one 
molecule to the HOMO-located hole of another molecule (cross transition); such an 
“emitting state” has been called electromer [113]. Electromer emission occurs when, due to 
a defect, the electron transfer from LUMO to LUMO and/or the hole from HOMO to 
HOMO is impeded. The level shift makes the emission red-shifted with respect to molecular 
emission as well as to the excimer emission. It is important to note that “electromer 
emission” requires the charge carries to be separated, for example, by the dissociation of a 
molecular excition. In the VR process such separated charge pairs (e-h) are formed when 
statistically independent carriers approach each other. Again, molecular and bimolecular 
excited states can be created. The difference between these two ways of creation of creation 
of emissive states is clearly apparent. The charge pair states, asa rule, precede final emissive 
states under recombination, and follow the localized states under photoexcitation. This is a 
good reason for expecting the bimolecular excited states to be produced more efficiently in 
the charge recombination process. Consequently the emission spectrum of recombination EL 
is expected to be, in general, different or at least more complex that under photoexcitation. 
There are several striking examples confirming this expectation. 
In the case of two- or multicomponent materials with different ionization potentials and 
electron affinities, the situation becomes more complex (Figure 2-3-2). Light absorbed by 
single-type molecules (electron donor molecules, D) produces excited donor singlet (D*). 
Their radiative relaxation shows up as donor fluorescence (hvD). Interacting with the ground 
state electron acceptor (A), they can form exciplexs or electroplexes [114~116]. the latter 
being two different molecules, analogous of electromers in single-component solids. The EL 
spectrum of such molecular systems may reveal several bands corresponding to different 
emissive species.

Figure 2-3-2. Excited states in two-component electron donor system formed under 
photoexcitation and in the electron-hole recombination process. 
Electroluminescence is the result of radiative recombination of electrons and holes in a 
material (usually a organic or inorganic semiconductor). The excited electrons release their 
energy as photons (light). Prior to recombination, electrons and holes are separated either as 
a result of doping the material to form a p-n junction (in semiconductor electroluminescent 
devices such as LEDs), or through excitation by impact of high-energy electrons accelerated 
by a strong electric field (as with the phosphors in electroluminescent displays) [117]. 
As described before, the mechanism of electroluminescence in EL devices can be 
divided as four steps:  
1) carriers injection; 2) carriers transport; 3) formation of excitons; 4) radiative deactivation. 
These emissive processes are depicted in Figure 2-3-3. Moreover, relative to the 
electroluminescent mechanism, the efficiency of EL devices can be shown in Figure 2-3-4.

2-4 The Emission of Intermolecular Interaction  
In the studies of PF or PPV derivatives, the spectral shifts (absorption and/or 
photoluminescence) from dilute solution to high concentration or solid state are usually 
observed. These shifts which do not originate from single polymeric chain are considered as 
contribution from intermolecular interaction. Generally, the EL polymers consist of planar 
and rigid structures. Therefore, in solid state, their main backbones are easy to stack and 
result in the overlap of conjugation. However, electroluminescences originated from 
interchain excitons which contributed from the delocalization of electron are usually 
observed and discussed. The delocalization reduces the excited state and shift emission to 
longer wavelength. So far, the emissions resulted from intermolecular interaction are 
regarded as the formation of excimers, exciplexes, electroplex, or aggregation. Their 
definitions are described as following [119]: 
The aggregate is formed by aggregation of several neighboring polymer segments at the 
ground state. 
The excimer (M*M) and exciplex (M*N) are formed by the interactions of a polymer 
segment at the excited state (M*) with its neighboring segment at the ground state of the 
same polymer (M) and a different polymer (N), respectively. 
Electroplex (M+N-)* is formed by cross recombination of electrons and holes in acceptor (N) 
 
 
36 
 
aggregation which possess stable ground and excited state, and that can be found in UV-vis 
absorption and photoluminescence spectra. The intermolecular interaction induced exciton 
lifetime is usually longer that favors the exciton to release energy via non-radiative process.  
In Figure 2-4-3, these horizontal displacements correspond to changes in the interchain 
C-C distances of 3.40 to 3.47 Å for CN-PPV and 4.10 to 4.16 Å for MEHPPV. Previous 
researches have demonstrated that the emission probability for the excimer in CN-PPV 
should be 16–20 times as large as for the excimer in MEHPPV [122]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2-4-3. Schematic illustration of chain packing for the Monte Carlo global minimum 
in MEH-PPV and CN-PPV. 
Thus the less quantum efficiency of interchain interaction is not unexpected. To avoid 
this, the close distance between two polymer chains should be avoided. Recently, 
introducing large side groups into polymer chain, using spiro-functionalized and/or 
hyperbranched polymer can reduce interchain interaction efficiently (Figure 2-4-4) [123].

EL materials emit a new peak only in EL, but not in PL. A similar phenomenon has also 
been found in devices with two materials as a binary blend or as a bilayer, for which the 
electric-field-induced complex was termed “electroplex”. Electroplex emission is formed by 
recombination of electrons and holes in acceptor and donor molecules. For example, the 
formation of electroplex can be found in the following polymer (Figure 2-4-5) [124].

(c) Funnel Effect [127] 
It is well known that the dendritic molecules, i.e., dendrimers and hyperbranched 
polymers, are provided with the favorably reduced intra-molecular and intermolecular 
interactions due to their characteristic branch structures, which in turn render them more 
soluble and highly fluorescent in the solid state [128~131]. One characteristic of dendritic 
molecules is the presence of numerous peripheral end groups that all converge to a single 
core. Such a structure naturally suggests itself as a molecular antenna suitable for 
transferring energy or electrons from the surface to the core. Indeed, several elegant 
light-harvesting dendrimers have been reported by Fréchet [132], Moore [133], and others 
[134]. Fréchet’s dye-labeled dendrimer utilizes flexible poly(aryl ether)s as the dendritic 
skeleton. The energy transfer from the peripheral dye to the center dye takes place through a 
dipole-dipole interaction (Förster Energy Transfer), which is distance dependent. Efficient 
energy transfer is achieved with dendrimers up to the fourth generation [132]. Moore 
reported a series of rigid phenylacetylene-based dendrimers with a fluorescent perylene 
chromophore at the locus [133]. One particularly novel design is the so-called “extended” 
dendrimer that possesses consecutively increasing conjugation length toward the center of 
the molecule, thus creating an energy gradient from the outside branches to the inside 
branches. Such a dendrimer could act as an energy funnel. 
However, all these light-harvesting systems utilize symmetrical dendrimers: dendrimers 
with equivalent branches. As a matter of fact, almost all the dendrimers (not just those 
developed for light harvesting applications) studied so far have symmetrical structures [135]. 
This is due partly to the chemists’ fascination with molecular regularity and partly to the 
ease in synthesis. A model of such dendrimers is shown in Figure 2-5-4 as model A. Trees in

Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods 
Semiempirical methods followed what are often called empirical methods where the 
two-electron part of the Hamiltonian is not explicitly included. For π-electron systems, this 
was the Hückel method proposed by Erich Hückel and for all valence electron systems, the 
Extended Hückel method proposed by Roald Hoffmann. Semiempirical calculations are 
much faster than their ab initio counterparts. Their results, however, can be very wrong if 
the molecule being computed is not similar enough to the molecules in the database used to 
parameterize the method. Semiempirical calculations have been most successful in the 
description of organic chemistry, where only a few elements are used extensively and 
molecules are of moderate size. 
Some of the major semi-empirical methods are listed below, together with the programs 
in which they are available (note that some of these methods have historical value rather 
than modern day utility):

to both MOPAC and AMPAC.

molecular structures and molecular orbital. The optimized molecular structures and 
electrochemical properties (HOMO, LUMO) were discussed in chapter 4~chapter 8.

The synthetic routes of polymers LPFA0%, HPFA4%, HPFA6%, HPFA11%, 
HPFA14% and HPFA22% are shown in Schemes 3-6 and described as following. 
The general synthetic procedures for the polymers are described as follows: To a 
solution of predetermined amount of monomers (3, A, and 24) in toluene was added with 
aqueous potassium carbonate (2 M) and ethanol. The mixture was degassed and exchanged 
with nitrogen three times, and a catalytic amount of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium 
[Pd(PPh3)4] (2.0 mol%) was added in one portion under nitrogen atmosphere. The solution 
was then stirred at 80oC under nitrogen. Before gelation, the trace end groups were then 
capped by refluxing 6 h each with phenylboronic acid and bromobenzene sequentially. After 
cooling, the resulting polymer was precipitated from methanol twice, collected by filtration 
and dried under vacuum. 
LPFA0%: 3 (0.19 g, 0.2 mmol), 24 (0.10 g, 0.2 mmol), toluene (8 mL), Pd(PPh3)4 
(0.011 g, 0.008 mmol), 2 M aqueous Na2CO3 solution (4 mL) and ethanol (4 mL) were used.

and exchanged with nitrogen three times, and a catalytic amount of 
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium [Pd(PPh3)4] (2.0 mol%) was added in one portion 
under nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was then stirred at 80oC under nitrogen. Before

acid and bromobenzene sequentially. After cooling, the resulting polymer was precipitated 
from methanol twice, collected by filtration and dried under vacuum.

4-1 Introduction 
Recently, electroluminescent (EL) polymers has been extensively investigated owing to 
their good film-forming properties, easy fabrication via spin coating, and their tunable 
luminescence properties, which make them excellent candidates in both single- and 
multi-layer polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) [6]. The most extensively studied EL 
polymers are the linear conjugated ones, such as poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) [6], 
polyfluorene (PF) and their derivatives [149,150]. Polyfluorenes (PFs) are promising 
materials for blue light-emitting diodes because of their high photoluminescence (PL) and 
electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies [1]. However, there are some drawbacks that hamper 
their potential applicability, such as the undesired green emission that appears upon thermal 
annealing or device operation [151]. This low-energy emission band has been attributed to 
the formation of interchain interaction (excimers or aggregates) [152] in the solid state 
and/or ketonic defects [101]. To minimize interchain interaction, several attempts have been 
made to use longer and branched side chains or bulky substituents [101], copolymerization 
techniques [102], dendrimer attachment [103], end-capping of PFs with bulky groups [104], 
cross-linking of PFs [105] and oligomer approach [102,106]. 
Recently, hyperbranched polymers have drawn a lot of attention and consideration to 
diminish formation of interchain interaction due to their highly branched and globular 
molecular structures [153]. Therefore, light-emitting hyperbranched polymers are of current 
interest for developing efficient electroluminescent devices and other photonic devices [154]. 
Moreover, Halim et al. reported that PLEDs made of three-dimensional polymers make the 
materials form good quality amorphous films, improve thermal stability and emission 
efficiency [155]. Comparing to dendritic polymers [107], hyperbranched polymers are not 
only easier to synthesize but also possess comparable properties. The hyperbranched 
structure is advantageous to its linear counterpart in high solubility, good processibility, and 
minimizing unfavorable intermolecular interactions and crystallization [156]. In addition, if 
a hyperbranched polymer has many peripheral chromophores, it will prefer to form a 
globular structure with generations [86]. By controlling the nature of the end groups, it is 
possible to endow these hyperbranched architectures with functions such as enhanced 
adhesion and energy harvesting as well as optoelectronic characteristics. Bo et al. reported 
the “AB2 + AB” approach to synthesize conjugated hyperbranched polyfluorenes [96]. 
Another novel “A2 + A2’ + B3” approach based on Suzuki coupling reaction was also 
developed for the preparation of hyperbranched polyfluorenes [97]. But the resulted 
polymers with high degree of branch were not soluble in common organic solvents.  
In order to avoid the excimer/aggregate formation and to improve the electron affinity 
and transport ability of PFs, we introduced a 3,4,5-triphenyl-1,2,4-triazole branching unit to 
prepare hyperbranched polyfluorenes. A novel A2 + A2’ + B3 approach based on Suzuki 
condensation coupling was employed for the synthesis of hyperbranched copolyfluorenes 
 
 
96 
 
The structure and constitutional composition of the hyperbranched polyfluorenes were 
estimated from the data of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. 
Linear polymer (LPFA0%) composed of polyfluorene main chain and carbazole side groups 
was also prepared for property study. Figure 3-4-27 and Figure 3-4-28 show the 1H NMR 
spectra of LPFA0% and HPFA4%~HPFA22%. The mole ratio of 3:24 can be readily 
estimated from the relative areas of the methylene protons of 3 (a: 1.8 ppm, b: 2.1 ppm) and 
24 (c: 2.0 ppm) residues. The molar ratios of 3:24 in HPFA4%, HPFA6%, HPFA11%, 
HPFA14% and HPFA22% are estimated to be 10:11.8, 5:6.67, 3:4.56, 2:3.42 and 1:2.59, 
respectively. The attempt to estimate the ratios of the branching triazole and fluorene units 
was inconclusive due to overlap of their chemical shifts around δ = 8.0 to 7.2 ppm. However, 
the ratio of the branching triazole unit (A) can be roughly estimated from the weight 
percents of carbon and nitrogen obtained in element analysis. The molar ratios (3: A: 24) in 
HPFA4%, HPFA6%, HPFA11%, HPFA14% and HPFA22% are estimated to be 
(10:0.98:11.8), (5:0.80:6.67), (3: 0.866:4.38), (2:0.91:3.51), and (1:1:2.56), i.e. the mole 
percentage of aromatic 1,2,4-triazole residue (A) in HPFA4%, HPFA6%, HPFA11%, 
HPFA14% and HPFA22% are 4.3%, 6.4%, 10.5%, 14.0% and 22.0%, respectively. The 
estimated mole percentages are close to the feed ones (4.4~22.2% as shown in Scheme 3-6) 
except HPFA6% (8.0%). Since the molar ratio of triazole unit in HPFA4% is the least, 
therefore, its 13C NMR and DEPT135 measurements were adapted to confirm the existence 
of A residue as shown in Figure 3-4-29. The chemical shifts of the C-2,5 of A residue can be 
observed at 155.8 ppm (a) in 13C NMR of HPFA4% (100.6 MHz, CDCl3).  
As shown in Table 4-1, the number-average (Mn) and weight-average molecular 
weights (Mw) of HPFA4%~HPFA22%, determined by gel permeation chromatography 
using mono-disperse polystyrene as calibration standard, are in the range of 5500~9700 and 
13800~25600, respectively, with polydispersity indexes (PDI) lying around 1.86~4.45. The 
copolymers are soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, and 
1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. Thermal properties of the polymers were evaluated by the TGA 
under nitrogen atmosphere and their thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight 
loss are over 446oC, which are much higher than corresponding linear polymer (LPFA0%: 
420oC). Neither melting temperature and nor obvious glass-transition temperature was 
observed below 300oC on their DSC thermograms, suggesting that they are basically 
amorphous materials. 
4-3-2 Optical Properties 
The optical characteristics of the polymers were investigated both in solution and as 
cast thin film. Their absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra in CHCl3 and in film 
state are shown in Figure 4-1-(a) and Figure 4-1-(b), respectively, and the related spectral 
maxima are summarized in Table 4-2. These polymers show absorption maxima around 
349~378 nm, both in solution and in film state, which are attributed to π-π* transition of the 
 
 
98 
 
Previous literature pointed out that although the absorption spectral maxima of 
oligofluorenes continue to shift to the longer wavelength through n = 10 (n: number of 
fluorene unit), while their emission maxima remain virtually unchanged beyond n = 6 [25]. 
In our system the conjugation length should extend with decreasing molar percent of triazole 
branch unit in the hyperbranched polymers. For instance, absorption maximum of 
HPFA22% (349 nm) shifts bathochromically to 378 nm of HPFA4% and LPFA0%. The 
emission spectral maxima, however, remains virtually unchanged, i.e. around 415~421 nm 
and 423~427 nm in CHCl3 and film state, respectively. This should be owing to efficient 
excitation energy transfer from short oligofluorenes to longer ones whose fluorene unit 
number (n) is over 6. Interestingly, we found that there exist a linear relationship between 
1/λmax and 1/(1 - ntriazole) as shown in Figure 4-2, where λmax represents the absorption 
maxima measured in film state and ntriazole is the molar fraction of triazole unit calculated 
from elemental analysis. The linear relationship between 1/λmax and 1/(1- ntriazole) indicates 
the linear relationship between 1/λmax and 1/(1- ntriazole) indicates that the effective 
conjugation length of the oligofluorene decreases smoothly with increasing triazole contents 
[25]. Accordingly, the average conjugation length of a hyperbranched oligofluorene can be 
estimated from its absorption maximum using the linear plot of 1/λmax versus 1/(1 - ntriazole).

The appearance of additional band is usually undesirable since it changes the pure blue 
emission to blue-green color [152]. To our best of knowledge no similar stable polyfluorene 
derivatives annealed in the elevated temperatures in air have been reported. Apparently, with 
the incorporation of carbarzole pendant groups (LPFA0%) and/or triazole branching unit 
(HPFA4%), the red-shift and excimer/ketone phenomena of polyfluorene can be reduced 
significantly. However, normalized PL emission spectra of HPFA6%~HPFA22% show 
additional characteristic broad band at about 520 nm after the annealing, and the band 
intensity enhances gradually with increasing triazole content. Higher degree of branch 
makes the hyperbranched polymers more three-dimensional to avoid excimer/aggregate 
formation in addition to bulky carbazole side chain. Therefore, the green emission should 
not originate from intermolecular interaction. In order to elucidate the origin of this 
abnormal green emission induced by thermal annealing, we measured the absorption spectra 
of monomer mixtures (3 + A) in CHCl3 (Figure 4-4-(a)). Interestingly, the mixtures with 3:A 
= 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 5:1 all exhibited broad absorption band at about 440-450 nm. Moreover, 
the PL spectra (excitation at 440 nm) of the mixtures with 3:A = 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 5:1 all 
exhibited green emission as shown in Figure 4-4-(b). However, no green emission was 
observed for 3:A = 10:1 and 1:0, which is similar to the result obtained after annealing 
LPFA0% and HPFA4% at 200°C for 1 h mentioned above. Therefore, the green emission 
possibly originates from the complex of triazole and carbazole units. Accordingly, the green 
emission becomes more obvious when molar ratio of A and 3 is approaching to one. The 
energy levels of 3 and A were also estimated from their onset reduction and oxidation 
potentials measured in acetonitrile. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 3 (A), 
estimated from the electrochemical data, are -5.41 eV (-6.44 eV) and -1.90 eV (-2.54 eV), 
respectively. The band gaps between HOMO level of 3 and LUMO level of A is 2.87 eV, 
which is corresponding well to the excitation wavelength (440 nm), suggesting that the two 
monomers form as complex readily.

the oxidation and reduction was proved to start from the former and the latter segments, 
respectively [158~160]. Recently, this characteristic was also found in linear EL copolymers

electron-acceptors segments [15,161,162]. In this work, the hyperbranched polymers

4-4 Summary 
One linear (LPFA0%) and five hyperbranched polyfluorenes (HPFA4%~HPFA22%) 
containing carbazole as pendant and aromatic 1,2,4-triazole as branching units were 
synthesized and characterized. These hyperbranched polymers can be dissolved in common 
organic solvents and exhibit good thermal stability (Td > 446oC). Their absorption maxima 
(λmax) locate at 349~378 nm both in CHCl3 and in film state, furthermore, linear relationship 
between 1/λmax and 1/(1-ntriazole) can be correlated. New blue-green emission (~520 nm) 
appears in the PL spectra of HPFA6%~HPFA22% after thermal annealing at 200oC for 1 h, 
which have been attributed to complexes formed from carbazole and aromatic 1,2,4-triazole 
chromophores. The oxidation and reduction start from the carbazole and triazole groups, 
respectively, due to their isolated characteristics. Two-layer PLED devices 
(ITO/PEDOT/LPFA0% or HPFA4%/Al) have been fabricated and their optical properties 
investigated, the maximum brightness of LPFA0% (HPFA4%) is 48 (161) cd/m2 at about 
19 V.

5-1 Introduction 
The study on electroluminescent (EL) polymers has been very active owing to their 
good film-forming properties, easy fabrication via spin-coating and ink-jetting, and their 
tunable luminescence properties, which make them excellent choice as emitting layer in both 
single- and multi-layer polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) [6]. Among EL polymers, the 
most extensively studied is the linear conjugated polymer, such as poly(p-phenylene 
vinylene) (PPV) [6], polyfluorene (PF) [149] and their derivatives [150]. Polyfluorenes (PFs) 
are promising materials for blue light-emitting diodes due to their high photoluminescence 
(PL) and EL efficiencies [1,149]. However, there are still some drawbacks that need to be 
solved, such as the undesired green emission that appears upon thermal annealing or device 
operation. This low-energy emission band has been attributed to the formation of interchain 
interaction (excimers or aggregates) in the solid state [152]. To minimize this interaction, 
several attempts have been made to use longer and branched side chains or bulky 
substituents [101], copolymerization techniques [102], dendrimer attachment [103], 
end-capping of PFs with bulky groups [104], cross-linking of PFs [105], and oligomer 
approach [102,106]. 
Hyperbranched polymers have also been employed to reduce inter-chain interaction due to 
their highly branched and globular molecular structures [153]. Therefore, they are of current 
interest as emitting materials for developing efficient electroluminescent devices and other 
photonic devices [154]. Halim et al. reported that three-dimensional polymers formed as 
good quality amorphous films and improved thermal stability and emission efficiency in 
fabricating PLEDs [155]. Moreover, comparing to dendritic polymers, hyperbranched 
polymers are much easier to synthesize while still present comparable properties [107]. The 
hyperbranched polymers possess limited intra- and intermolecular interactions that reduce 
the possibility of unwanted processes, such as aggregation or excimer formation. Therefore, 
the hyperbranched structure is advantageous to its linear counterpart in high solubility, good 
processability, and minimizing unfavorable intermolecular interactions and crystallization 
[156]. In addition, if a hyperbranched polymer has many peripheral chromophores, it will 
prefer to form as a globular structure with generations [86]. By controlling the nature of the 
end groups in hyperbranched polymers, it is possible to endow these copolymer 
architectures with functions such as enhanced adhesion and energy harvesting as well as 
optoelectronic characteristics. The “AB2 + AB” approach was the first strategy developed to 
synthesize conjugated hyperbranched polymers [96]. Another “A3 + A2 + B2” approach 
based on Suzuki coupling reaction was also developed for the preparation of hyperbranched 
polyfluorenes using oxadiazole as branching units [97]. But the resulting polymers were 
insoluble in common organic solvents when incorporated with high degree of branch.  
We synthesized a new branching monomer, 3-(3,5-dibromophenyl)-5- 
(4-bromophenyl)-4-(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole (B), which possesses three

5-3-1 Synthesis and Characterization   
The structure and composition of the hyperbranched polyfluorenes 
(HPFB5%~HPFB13%) were characterized and estimated from the data of high-resolution 
NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Linear poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene) (LPFB0%) 
was also prepared for comparative property study. The synthetic results and solubility 
properties of LPFB0%~HPFB13% are summarized in Table 5-1.

In a separate experiment, we prepared a Model B (Scheme 3-2) from B and 12 (molar 
ratio = 1:3) under the same condition of HPFB13% (80oC, 6 h) to determine the 
completeness of the Suzuki coupling reaction. From 1H NMR spectral analysis (Figure 
3-4-11), we found that model compound was about 92% three-substituted product, 
indicating that under our polymerization conditions most of the bromo groups had been 
reacted. Figure 3-4-31 shows the 1H NMR spectra of HPFB5%~HPFB13%, in which the 
molar ratios of B:(24+25) can be readily estimated from the relative areas of methylene 
protons of B (a: 4.1 ppm) and 24+25 (b: 2.0 ppm) residues. The molar ratios of B: (24+25) 
in HPFB5%, HPFB8% and HPFB13% were estimated to be 1:19.5, 1:12.3 and 1:6.53, 
respectively, from which the mole percentages of the branching triazole unit (B residue) 
were calculated to be 4.8, 7.5 and 13.3%. The estimated mole percentages (4.8~13.3%) are 
close to the feed ones (4.4~11.8%) shown in Scheme 3-7. The resulting copolymers are 
soluble in common solvents such as chloroform, NMP, and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, etc. 
The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of LPFB0%~HPFB13%, as determined by gel 
permeation chromatography using polystyrene standard, range from 1.16×104 to 5.90×104 
with polydispersity indexes lying around 1.49~2.25. The low PDI values can be attributed to

s Superscript s means wavelength of the shoulder.  
b These values were estimated by using quinine sulfate (dissolved in 1 N H2SO4(aq) with 
a concentration of 10-5 M, assuming ΦPL of 0.55) as a standard.  
The PL peaks of LPFB0%~HPFB13% films locate around 424~425 nm, which 
red-shift slightly (ca. 8 nm) relative to those in CHCl3 (416~418 nm). Previous literature 
pointed out that although the absorption spectral maxima of oligofluorene continue to shift 
to the longer wavelength through n = 10 (n: number of repeating fluorene unit), while their 
emission maxima remain virtually unchanged beyond n = 6 [25]. In our system, the 
conjugation length should extend with decreasing mole percent of triazole branch unit in the 
hyperbranched polymers. For instance, both in solution and film state, the absorption 
maxima shift bathochromically from 363 nm and 377 nm (HPFB13%) to 388 nm and 392 
nm (LPFB0%), respectively. The emission maxima, however, remain roughly unchanged, 
i.e. around 416~418 nm and 424~425 nm in solution and film state, respectively. This 
should be owing to efficient excitation energy transfer from short oligofluorenes to longer 
ones whose fluorene unit number (n) is over 6. Interestingly, we found that there exists a 
linear relationship between 1/λmax and 1/(1 - ntriazole) as shown in Figure 5-3-(a), where λmax

as shown in PL spectra of HPFB5%~HPFB13%, the band intensity decreases gradually 
with an increase in triazole content. Higher degree of branching makes HPFB13% more 
three-dimensional to lessen excimer/aggregate formation. The appearance of additional band 
is usually undesirable since it changes the emission color from pure blue to blue-green [152]. 
No similar hyperbranched polyfluorenes which is stable to annealing at elevated 
temperatures has been reported so far. Present results suggest that incorporation of the 
1,2,4-triazole branching unit is an effective way in improving annealing stability of 
polyfluorenes [167,168].

reduction potentials of HPFB5%~HPFB13% shift obviously to 0.84~0.89 V and 
-2.06~-2.07 V after incorporating triazole branching units. The estimated HOMO and

Recently, this characteristics were also found in linear EL copolymers possess twisted 
connectors (such as biphenylene) between electron-donor and electro-acceptor moieties 
[15,161,162]. In this work, the hyperbranched polymers HPFB5%~HPFB13% are also 
consisting of electron- (triazole) and hole-transporting (oligofluorene) segments, and the 
triazole moiety is connected with fluorene derivatives via a σ-bond. The twisted structure 
between them effectively limits delocalization of electronic charges, whose effect  
is similar to the ether spacer or biphenylene connector mentioned above [158~162].

Hyperbranched Poly(fluorenevinylene) from a 
2,4,7-Tri-functional Fluorene Monomer with Different 
Degree of Branch  
 
    Hyperbranched (HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 and HPFV0.08-cap) and linear (LPFV0.17) 
polyfluorene were prepared from a A3-type [2,4,7-tribromomethyl-dihexylfluorene] (D) and 
A2-type [2,7-dibromomethyl-dihexylfluorene] (D’) monomers, respectively, under different 
concentration (the numbers represent monomer concentration in mmol/mL). The 
hyperbranched polymers have been characterized by NMR, FT-IR, UV-Vis, GPC and 
fluorescence spectroscopy. They show good solubility in common organic solvents such as 
CHCl3 and CH2Cl2. The number-average (Mn) and weight-average molecular weights (Mw) 
of the polymers were in the range of 2.20~3.69 × 104and 4.48~6.34 × 104, respectively, with 
polydispersity indexes (PDI) lying around 1.57~2.20. Optical properties, both in solution 
and film state, were investigated using absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. In 
film state, the absorption (PL) spectra of hyperbranched polymers peaked at 286 nm and 372 
nm (465 nm and 485 nm). The effective conjugation length in HPFV0.04 is about 2 repeat 
units (λmax,Abs = 372 nm). For HPFV0.17, the absorption intensity at 372 nm reduced greatly 
due probably to leads to rampant twisted structures in polymer backbone. An almost linear 
relationship between feed concentration and degree of branch (DB) was correlated, 
suggesting that the reaction probability of 4-bromomethyl was raised gradually with 
monomer concentration. The HOMO and LUMO levels of HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17, 
estimated from their cyclic voltammograms, locate at -5.60~-5.64 eV and -2.52~-2.54 eV, 
respectively, whereas those of LPFV0.17 were at -5.53 eV and -2.74 eV. Two-layer PLED 
devices (ITO/PEDOT/HPFV0.08-cap/Ca/Al) exhibited maximal luminance and luminous 
efficiency of 2180 cd/m2 and 0.89 cd/A, respectively, which are superior to linear LPFV0.17 
(1452 cd/m2, 0.47 cd/A) and other hyperbranched polymers without end-capping (184~26 
cd/m2).

where D, T and L are the fractions of dendritic, terminal and linear monomer units, 
respectively, incorporated into the hyperbranched structures. Furthermore, an expression for 
DB in hyperbranched polymers based on ABm monomers was derived by Frey [139]:

From statistical point of view and above equation, DB may not exceed 0.5 in 
hyperbranched polymers based on AB2 systems and 0.44 in AB3 systems. Later, Frey 
proposed three different possible ways to enhance DB beyond the limiting value of a 
random polycondensation of ABm monomer [142]: (a) enhanced reactivity of linear vs. 
terminal units, (b) polymerization of pre-fabricated perfect dendritic units and (c) slow 
addition technique. 
We employed a tri-functional derivative of fluorene – [2,4,7-tribromomethyl- 
dihexylfluorene] (D) which was used as branch unit to prepare A3-type hyperbranched 
polymers, HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 and HPFV0.08-cap, by the Gilch reaction at room 
temperature [22]. The suffix cap means the trace terminal bromomethyl groups were 
end-capped with benzyl bromide. Although hyperbranched polyfluorene derivatives were 
reported in the past [96,165], this is the first report to prepare hyperbranched polyfluorene 
using fluorene both as monomer and branch unit. The suffix numbers in the polymer names 
(HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17) represent monomer concentration, i.e. 0.04 mmol/mL~0.17 
mmol/mL. A linear counterpart LPFV0.17 was also synthesized from 
[2,7-dibromomethyl-dihexylfluorene] (D’) for comparative study. In order to confirm the 
relation between feed concentration and degree of branch (DB), HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 
were not end-capped so that we used the residual bromomethyl groups to calculate the D, T, 
L and DB. And further, the optical, electrochemical and preliminary electroluminescent 
properties of the hyperbranched polymers (HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 and HPFV0.08-cap) 
were investigated and compared to its corresponding linear polymer (LPFV0.17).

described in chapter 3. All polymers are synthesized by Gilch reaction [22]. The structures 
of polymers which discussed in this chapter are depicted as Scheme 6-2.

HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 were not end-capped by benzyl bromide. The relative peak areas of 
protons at a, b and c positions (Figure 3-4-33) are ascribed to protons at benzene rings, 4- 
and 2,7-bromomethyl groups, respectively. In Chart 6-1, among the seven possible linkages 
of monomer units in hyperbranched polymer we assumed that L1 = L2 >> L3 and T1 = T2. 
Based on the assumption and the relative peak areas of protons in Figure 3-4-33, the molar 
ratio of D (dendritic), L (linear) and T (terminal) units of HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 were 
estimated and their relation with monomer concentration plotted. As shown in Figure 6-1 the 
molar ratio of L units decreases with an increase in monomer concentration, whereas that of 
D units shows the opposite trend.

The linear polymer (LPFV0.17) shows absorption maxima at 424 nm in solution and 430 
nm in film state. The hyperbranched polymers show long wavelength absorption maxima 
around 372 nm both in solution and in film state, which are attributed to π-π* transition of 
the conjugated oligofluorene. According to previous literature [169], our hyperbranched 
polymers (HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17) possessing the effective conjugation length correspond 
to the linear oligo(fluorenevinylene) with 2 repeat units (λmax  = 376 nm). In general, 
hyperbranched structure reduces π-conjugation length, as compared with its linear 
counterpart, due to possible interruption of the conjugation at branch unit [170]. Figure 6-6 
depicts the optimized geometries obtained from semi-empirical MNDO calculation [171]. 
By comparing Figure 6-6-(a) with 6-6-(b), clearly branching at 4-position results in 29˚ twist 
angle between the two fluorene units, suggesting that effective conjugation length of 
polyfluorene is readily reduced. Therefore, the effective conjugation length in HPFV0.04 is 
about 2 repeat units (λmax = 372 nm), which is much lower than that of linear LPFV0.17 
(λmax = 424 nm). And furthermore, the absorbance intensity at 372 nm of HPFV0.12 and 
HPFV0.17 are further degenerated relative to those of HPFV0.04 and HPFV0.08 (Figure 
6-4 and Figure 6-5), suggesting that increased DB leads to rampant twisted structures in 
polymer backbone. The PL peaks of the polymers in CHCl3 locate mainly around 464~465 
nm. This should be owing to excitation energy transfer from short conjugated 
oligo(fluorenevinylene) to longer ones.

6-3-3. Electrochemical Property   
Cyclic voltammograms of HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17, HPFV0.08-cap and LPFV0.17 
films coated on a glassy carbon (working electrode) were measured in Figure 6-8 and their 
electrochemical data are summarized in Table 6-3. For linear LPFV0.17, the onset oxidation 
(p-doping) and reduction potentials (n-doping) versus FOC locate at 0.73 and -2.06 V, 
respectively. The onset oxidation potentials of hyperbranched HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 and 
HPFV0.08-cap located at 0.80~0.84 V and the onset reduction potentials shift moderately to 
-2.26~-2.28 V. It is noteworthy that hyperbranched polymers possess very similar onset 
reduction potentials. Comparing with linear model, as shown in Figure 6-9, the LUMO of 
the branched model are almost situated at D unit. The estimated HOMO and LUMO energy 
levels of HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 locate at -5.60~-5.64 eV and -2.52~-2.54 eV, respectively, 
whereas those of LPFV0.17 were at -5.53 eV and -2.74 eV. The estimated band gap (Egel) of 
HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 are 3.10-3.12 eV based on the electrochemical results. The optical 
band gaps (Egopt) of HPFV0.04~HPFV0.17 calculated from the onset absorption in thin film 
state are 2.63-2.69 eV, which is much smaller than those obtained from CV measurements. 
This is probably due to different mechanisms involved in the two measurements. The onset 
absorption is mostly contributed by inner parts of the hyperbranched globules, while the 
oxidation and reduction processes in CV measurements are mainly happened on the 
periphery groups.

6-3-4 Device Properties 
EL devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Ca/Al) employing HPFV0.04, HPFV0.08, 
HPFV0.12, HPFV0.08-cap and LPFV0.17 as emitting layer were fabricated to investigate 
their EL spectral characteristics. In Figure 6-10, the EL spectra of LPFV0.17 and 
HPFV0.08-cap are similar to their PL spectra as shown in Figure 6-5 and Figure 6-7, 
respectively. This is probably owing to excitation energy transfer from periphery groups to 
inner, longer conjugated oligo(fluorenevinylene)s under a bias. The EL spectra of 
HPFV0.04, HPFV0.08 and HPFV0.12 reveal a new peak at 516 nm and a much broader 
emission in longer wavelength region, which might be due to external heavy atom effect on 
singlet-triplet transitions [172]. The EL performances of the devices are shown in Table 6-4. 
The maximal luminance of HPFV0.08-cap device was 2180 cd/m2 at a current density of 
244 mA/cm2 (bias: 21 V) and the CIE coordinate of the emission light was (0.24, 0.41). The 
maximal luminance of LPFV0.17 is 1452 cd/m2 at a current density of 312 mA/cm2, which 
is comparable to the EL performance of previously reported oligo(fluorenevinylene) with 9 
repeat units (885 cd/m2 and 0.25 cd/A) [169]. In addition, luminance efficiency of 
HPFV0.08-cap (0.89 cd/A) is about two times of LPFV0.17 (0.47 cd/A). It is evident that 
the EL performance of hyperbranched polymer with end-capped device is superior to that 
from linear LPFV0.17. This is probably owing to the hyperbranched polymer possess higher 
fluorescence quantum yield [96,165,170]. The maximal luminance of 
HPFV0.04~HPFV0.12 are 184~26 cd/m2 and the CIE coordinates of the emission light are 
(0.31, 0.40), (0.32, 0.42) and (0.33, 0.43), respectively. The external heavy atom effect on 
singlet-triplet transitions leads the lower luminance efficiency.

Hyperbranched Copoly(fluorenevinylene) from a 
2,4,7-Tri-functional Fluorene Monomer 
 
    A new hyperbranched (HPFPPV-oxa) and linear copolyfluorene (LPFPPV-oxa) were 
prepared from 2,4,7-trifunctional (E) and 2,7-bifunctional (E’) fluorene monomer 
respectively by the Wittig reaction, followed with end-capping by aromatic oxadiazole 
compound (18), to study the effect of hyperbranch structure. The weight-average molecular 
weights (Mw) of HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa, determined by gel permeation 
chromatography using polystyrene as standard, were 3.30 × 104 and 2.57 × 104, respectively. 
The polymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents and exhibited good thermal 
stability (Td > 400oC). Optical properties, both in solution and film state, were investigated 
using absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. In film state, the absorption and PL 
spectra peaked at 401~425 nm and 480~495 nm, respectively. The HPFPPV-oxa showed 
energy funnel effect and enhanced fluorescence efficiency owing to hyperbranched structure 
and terminal oxadiazole groups. The HOMO and LUMO levels of HPFPPV-oxa 
(LPFPPV-oxa), estimated from cyclic voltammograms, are -5.34 (-5.25) eV and -2.94 
(-2.94) eV, respectively. Two-layer PLED devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HPFPPV-oxa/Ca/Al) 
exhibited maximal luminance and luminous efficiency of 3630 cd/m2 and 0.78 cd/A, 
respectively, which are superior to its linear counterpart LPFPPV-oxa (598 cd/m2, 0.11 
cd/A).

7-2 Experiment 
The synthetic routes of compounds (Scheme 3-4) and polymers (Scheme 3-10) were 
described in chapter 3. The structures of polymers which discussed in this chapter are 
depicted as Scheme 7-2. All polymers are synthesized by Wittig reaction [18]. In 
polymerization of HPFPPV-oxa, the ratio of feed (E:26 = 0.5:1) is chosen to form the 
hyperbranched polymer possessing many aldehyde groups at terminal and to prevent the 
gelation during polymerization. In polymerization of LPFPPV-oxa, the ratio of feed 
(E’:26=0.5:0.5) is chosen to form a linear counterpart, therefore, after polymerization for 24 
h we added another 26 (0.1mmol). After end-capped reaction, complete reaction of aldehyde 
groups in HPFPPV-oxa or LPFPPV-oxa was ascertained by the disappearance of specific 
stretching vibration of C=O at 1697 cm-1 using a FT-IR spectroscopy and 1H NMR spectra 
(Figure 3-4-34).

7-3 Results and Discussion 
7-3-1 Synthesis and Characterization 
Figure 3-4-16-(a) shows the 1H NMR spectra of compound D, the 2,4,7-tri-functional 
derivative of fluorene was confirmed in chapter 6. Although hyperbranched polyfluorene 
derivatives were reported in the past [96,97], this is the first report to prepare hyperbranched 
copolyfluorene using fluorene both as monomer and branch unit. The synthetic results and 
characterization of HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa are summarized in Table 7-1. The 
 
 
136 
 
and the corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 7-2. In CHCl3, the absorption 
maxima of HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa are situated at 400 nm and 421 nm, 
respectively, which are attributable to the π-π* transition in the polymer chain. The 
conjugation length of polyfluorenevinylene (HPFV0.08~HPFV0.17) is readily reduced after 
incorporating the D units (Figure 6-6). Here we employed the copolymerization method to 
reduce the localization of electrons at D units. Figure 7-2 depicts optimized geometries 
obtained from semi-empirical MNDO calculation (in gas phase). It is noteworthy that 
incorporation of phenyl-vinylene at 4-position of fluorene, the twist angle between the 
planes of benzene and fluorene units is only 3˚. Therefore, the conjugation is not interrupted 
at 4-linkage.

π-conjugated dendrimer [175] and hyperbranched PPV based on meta- and para-linked 
phenylacetylenes [176]. The fluorescence quantum yield [177] of HPFPPV-oxa are about 
1.6 times as that of LPFPPV-oxa, which is presumably due to the efficient energy funnel 
effect. We did the other two polymers end-capped with benzyl triphenylphosphonium 
chloride (TCI, 99%) as counterparts of HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa, we named as 
HPFPPV and LPFPPV. The fluorescence quantum yield22 of HPFPPV and LPFPPV are 
about 1.2 times and 0.9 times as that of LPFPPV-oxa, respectively. It could be contributed 
that the oxadiazole groups have an important role in the enhancement. Figure 7-1-(b) shows 
the PL spectra of HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa in film state, in which HPFPPV-oxa 
show smaller red-shift (1 nm) than LPFPPV-oxa (6 nm) when compared to those in CHCl3, 
suggesting that the hyperbranched structure in HPFPPV-oxa suppresses the aggregation. 
7-3-3. Electrochemical Property   
Cyclic voltammograms of HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa films coated on a glassy carbon 
working electrode were recorded and employed to investigate their electrochemical 
properties (Table 7-3). As shown in Figure 7-3, during the anodic scan, oxidations of 
HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa are observed at 0.95V and 0.82 V with the onset potentials 
estimated to be 0.54 V and 0.45 V, respectively, which are mainly derived from the 
oligofluorene segments. During the cathodic scan, both the onset reductions of 
HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa are situated at -1.86 V which is coincident with that of 
compound 17 (Scheme 3-4), suggesting that they are all ascribed to the oxadiazole segments. 
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HPFPPV-oxa (LPFPPV-oxa), estimated from the 
onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials, are -5.34 eV (-5.25 eV) and -2.94 eV (-2.94 
eV), respectively. The band gaps of HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa are estimated to be 
2.40 eV and 2.31 eV based on the electrochemical results, whereas the band gap (Egopt) of 
HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa calculated from the onset absorption in thin film state are 
2.55 eV and 2.53 eV. The optically-derived band gap (Egopt) estimated from onset absorption 
is greater than that obtained from CV measurement (Egel). This is attributed to the fact that 
oxidation and reduction might start from different portions of HPFPPV-oxa and 
LPFPPV-oxa composed of oligofluorene and oxadiazole segment. Optimized geometry and 
molecular orbital (LUMO and HOMO) of the terminal three residues via semi-empirical 
MNDO calculation are depicted in Figure 7-4 [157], in which the HOMO and LUMO are 
situated at hole- (oligofluorene) and electron-transporting (oxadiazole) segments, 
respectively. The result is similar to those obtained in copolymers consisting of hole- and 
electron-transporting segments separated by ether spacer or biphenylene connector reported 
previously [158~162]. This is also coincident with the aforementioned funnel effect 
(electron injection) since HPFPPV-oxa comprises electron-transporting oxadiazole as 
peripheral groups.

7-3-4 Device Properties 
Two-layer electroluminescent (EL) devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Ca/Al) 
employing HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa as emitting materials were fabricated to 
investigate their EL characteristics. Figure 7-5 shows the EL spectra of HPFPPV-oxa and 
LPFPPV-oxa at their maximal luminance. The main emission peaks of HPFPPV-oxa and 
LPFPPV-oxa devices are situated at 483, 508 nm and 494, 520 nm, respectively, which are 
similar to their PL spectral data (Table 7-2). However, the EL intensity of HPFPPV-oxa 
device is much greater than that of LPFPPV-oxa device over the whole wavelength region. 
The device performances (I-V-L) of the hyperbranched HPFPPV-oxa and linear 
LPFPPV-oxa are shown in Figure 7-6 with the characteristic data summarized in Table 7-4. 
The onset voltage of HPFPPV-oxa device (4.1 V) is much lower than that of LPFPPV-oxa 
(6.2 V), which is attributable to more abundant terminal oxadiazole groups in hyperbranched 
HPFPPV-oxa to promote electron injection. The maximal luminance of HPFPPV-oxa 
device is 3630 cd/m2 at a current density of 465 mA/cm2 (bias: 8.3 V) and the CIE 
coordinate of the emission light is (0.26, 0.44). The maximal luminance of LPFPPV-oxa 
device is 598 cd/m2 at a current density of 568 mA/cm2 (bias: 11.3 V). In addition, 
luminance efficiency of HPFPPV-oxa device (0.78 cd/A) is about seven times that of 
LPFPPV-oxa device (0.11 cd/A). It is evident that the performance of the EL device from 
hyperbranched HPFPPV-oxa is superior to that from linear LPFPPV-oxa. Additional, we 
employing HPFPPV and LPFPPV as emitting materials were fabricated to investigate their 
EL characteristics. The maximum brightness (current efficiency) of HPFPPV and LPFPPV 
devices are 1420 cd/m2 (0.38 cd/A) and 512 cd/m2 (0.072 cd/A), respectively. The distinct

7-4 Summary 
Hyperbranched copolyfluorene (HPFPPV-oxa) containing oxadiazole terminal groups 
were successfully synthesized from a tri-functional fluorene monomer (E) using the Wittig 
reaction. The polymer was soluble in common organic solvents and exhibited good thermal 
stability (Td > 400oC). Enhanced fluorescence efficiency was observed in HPFPPV-oxa, 
which has been attributed to hyperbranched structure and energy funnel effect. Two-layer 
EL devices (ITO/PEDOT/HPFPPV-oxa or LPFPPV-oxa/Ca/Al) were fabricated and their 
optoelectronic properties investigated. The maximal luminance and luminance efficiency of 
HPFPPV-oxa device were 3630 cd/m2 and 0.78 cd/A, respectively, both were much greater 
than those of linear LPFPPV-oxa device (598 cd/m2 and 0.11 cd/A). Improved EL 
performance in HPFPPV-oxa device has been attributed to higher concentration of 
peripheral oxadiazole groups which promote electron injection from cathode. In conclusion, 
the new tri-functional fluorene (E) and hyperbranched copolyfluorene (HPFPPV-oxa) 
represent useful new monomer and material, respectively, for optoelectronic applications.

luminescence through structural design, which make them excellent choice as emitting layer 
in both single- and multi-layer polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) [1]. Among EL 
polymers, the most extensively studied are the linear, fully-conjugated polymers such as 
poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) [6], polyfluorene (PF) [149] and their derivatives [150]. 
Polyfluorenes (PFs) are recognized as promising materials for blue light-emitting diodes due 
to their excellent thermal stability, high photoluminescence (PL) and EL efficiencies 
[1,149].  
Recently, hyperbranched polymers have drawn a lot of attention and consideration to 
suppress detrimental inter-chain interactions because of their highly branched and globular 
molecular structures [153]. Therefore, light-emitting hyperbranched polymers are of current 
interest for developing efficient electroluminescent and other photonic devices [154]. Many 
methods have been developed to prepare hyperbranched polymers, such as “A3+B2” [109], 
“AB2+AB” [96], “AB2” [100] and “A2+B2+A3” [97,165] approaches, using 
1,3,5-trisaldehyde, 3,5-dibromobenzeneboronic acid, 1-bromo-2,4-divinylbenzene, 
5-(3,5-dibromophenyl)-2-(4-bromophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 3,4,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)-4H 
-1,2,4-triazole as branching units. As compared to dendritic polymers and other well-defined 
polymers [107,173], hyperbranched polymers are not only easier to synthesize but also 
possess comparable properties. Furthermore, the hyperbranched polymers generally possess 
low polydispersity and high degree of branching (DB) (DB = 0 for linear polymer and DB = 
1 for dendrimer), i.e., hyperbranched structures that resemble perfect dendrimers [139]. The 
DB is commonly determined by NMR-spectroscopy of the hyperbranched molecules, from 
which the degree of branching is readily calculated using the following equation [139]: 
TLD
TDDB ++
+=                                  (1) 
where D, T and L are the fractions of dendritic, terminal and linear monomer units, 
respectively, incorporated into the hyperbranched structures. Furthermore, an expression for 
DB in hyperbranched polymers based on ABm monomers was derived by Frey [139]:

⎞⎜⎝
⎛ −=

mDB                                (2) 
From statistical point of view, DB may not exceed 0.5 in hyperbranched polymers based on 
AB2 systems (0.44 in AB3 systems). Later, Frey proposed three different possible ways to 
enhance DB beyond the limiting value of a random polycondensation of ABm monomer 
[142]: (a) enhanced reactivity of linear vs. terminal units, (b) polymerization of 
prefabricated perfect dendritic units and (c) slow addition technique. 
In addition, a hyperbranched polymer may possess many peripheral reactive groups 
when prepared by the Heck coupling [99] or Wittig reactions [109]. By controlling the 
nature of the terminal groups, it is possible to endow these hyperbranched architectures with 
 
 
146 
 
positions. Furthermore, Figure 3-4-23 illustrates the experimental 400 MHz NOESY 
spectrum of 20 in chloroform solution, in which the assignment is made by the 1H spectrum 
to the 1H spectrum through the cross peak. The proton at d position shows NOE with f- (4.56 
ppm) and e-protons (4.81 ppm). The proton at a-position shows NOE only with e-proton 
(4.81 ppm). Therefore, the molecular structure of 20 can be confirmed as 
2-bromo-5,7-bis(bromomethyl)-9,9-dihexylfluorene. The considerable difference in carbon 
content in 21 between calculated and found EA data may be due to the presence of trace 
impurity. However, the purity of monomer F is acceptable, suggesting that the trace impurity 
in 21 was readily removed during the purification of F. Figure 3-4-24 and 3-4-26 shows the 
1H NMR spectra of the new monomers F and F’. The degree of branch (DB) of HOFV can 
be estimated from relative peak areas of protons at e, f and g positions shown Figure 3-4-35. 
Among the four possible linkages of monomer units in HOFV (Chart 8-1), it was assumed 
that the content of L1 is much more abundant than L2. Based on this assumption the DB was 
estimated to be 0.64 (D = 0.19, L = 0.46 and T = 0.35) using equation (1).

Chart 8-1. The D, L and T in HOFV. 
 
The synthetic results and characterization of LOFV and HOFV are summarized in 
Table 8-1. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of LOFV and HOFV, determined 
by gel permeation chromatography using polystyrene as standard, were 3950 and 2350 with 
the polydispersity indexes (PDI) of 1.40 and 1.12, respectively. The lower PDI value of 
HOFV can be attributed to tri-functional structure of monomer 4 [96,97] which narrows 
down the molecular weight distribution, as compared to linear oligomer (LOFV), from the 
statistical point of view. Thermal stability of the oligomers was evaluated by 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere. In Figure 8-1, the thermal 
 
 
148 
 
emerge around δ 3.5~2.2 ppm (chemical shifts of the cyclobutane). Clearly, the two 
neighboring vinyl groups are readily cyclized to cyclobutane ring upon thermal curing [182]. 
This result is coinciding with the intensity enhancement of IR spectra around 2926 cm-1 
corresponding to C-H stretching vibration-sym of alkyl groups. Hence, the degree of 
branching (DB) of hyperbranched polymer (HOFV-cured) is almost 100 % after thermal 
curing of the HOFV film.

The thermal cross-linking reaction was also obviously observed in DSC thermogram. 
As shown in Figure 8-4, during the first heating scan of HOFV, an obvious exothermic peak 
appears around 110~130˚C, which is believed to be corresponding to the heat of 
cross-linking. However, no evident thermal transition was observed for linear LOFV and on 
a repeated heating scan for HOFV, indicating that the exothermic peak around 110~130 ˚C 
can be associated with the consumption of the reactive periphery vinyl groups [100].  
Figure 8-5 shows the variation of SEM micrographs for the HOPV film during curing 
process. The surface morphology of HOFV film before heat treatment [Figure 8-5-(a)] is 
heterogeneous and shows large separated aggregates. This indicates that the film-forming 
property of HOFV is extremely poor due probably due to its low molecular weight (Mw = 
2350). However, the film homogeneity is improved significantly with thermal curing and 
becomes as a homogeneous film after 2 h [Figure 8-5-(c)]. Homogeneous polymer films are 
highly desirable in fabricating EL devices. However, LOFV film was heterogeneous and

8-3-2 Optical Properties  
The optical characteristics of linear LOFV and hyperbranched HOFV were 
investigated both in solution and as cast thin films. Their absorption and photoluminescence

π-conjugation length, as compared to its linear counterpart, due to possible interruption of 
the conjugation at branch unit. In case of the newly synthesized branching monomer F, 
Heck polymerization via 2,7-linkage leads to more extended main chain, in contrast to that 
via 2,5-linkage. It is evident that the blue shift in the absorption (λmax = 415 nm) of 
hyperbranched HOFV relative to linear LOFV (λmax = 423 nm) is owing to the 2,5-linking 
branches that interrupt the conjugation. Such unique structural feature in branch unit 
(2,5,7-linkage) suggests that an energy gradient from the periphery to the core exists in the 
hyperbranched HOFV. Furthermore, the conjugation lengths of the fluorenevinylene 
segments are widely distributed since two kinds of linkage (2,5- and 2,7-) lead to different 
conjugation range, which is also evident from the broad absorption spectrum. Therefore, the 
photo-excited energy can be transferred from the periphery 2,5-linking branch (high energy) 
to the inherent 2,7-linking backbone (low energy), which has been termed as “funnel effect” 
in describing efficient energy transfer from higher band-gap branches to the longest 
conjugated segment in hyperbranched polymers or dendrimers [99,175]. In previous 
literature, the PL efficiency of poly(fluorenevinylene) was evaluated in THF by determining 
their fluorescence quantum yields (ФPL) against the quinine sulfate (ФPL = 0.546) [183]. The 
ФPLs of HOFV and LOFV were also determined by similar method for the easiness of 
comparison. As shown in Table 8-2 the quantum yield of HOFV (ФPL = 0.586) are about 1.1 
times that of LOFV (ФPL = 0.52), which is presumably attributed to the efficient energy 
funnel effect. The PL quantum yield of LOFV is lower than poly(fluorenevinylene) (ФPL = 
0.54) probably due to its lower molecular weight. The PL peaks of LOFV and HOFV films 
located around 473 and 475 nm, respectively, which are red-shifted slightly (ca. 7 and 8 nm) 
relative to those in chloroform (466 nm, 467 nm). Figure 8-8 shows the absorption and PL 
spectra of HOFV before and after thermal curing at 150 oC. The major absorption and 
photoluminescence of HOFV film is situated at 416 nm and 475 nm, respectively, which 
remains almost unchanged after curing at 150 oC for 2 h and then rinsed with chloroform,. 
This suggests that the curing reaction occurs mainly at terminal vinyl groups, since reaction 
of internal vinylene moieties should lead to obvious absorption blue-shift due to interrupted 
conjugation. This also confirms that the vinylene double bonds are less thermally reactive 
than the terminal vinyl groups.

8-3-4 Device Properties 
Two-layer electroluminescent (EL) devices, using LOFV-cured and HOFV-cured as 
emitting materials, were fabricated to investigate their optoelectronic characteristics. 
HOFV-cured (LOFV-cured) film is fabricated by spin-coating with HOFV (LOFV) (20 
mg/mL in toluene) and then curing at 150 oC in vacuum oven for 2 h. Figure 8-10 shows the 
EL spectra of the devices at their maximal luminance. The main emission peaks are situated 
at 476 and 504 nm, similar to their PL spectral data (Table 8-2). The EL performances (I-V-L) 
of the linear (LPFV) and hyperbranched (HPFV) devices are shown in Figure 8-11 with 
their characteristic data summarized in Table 8-4. The maximal luminance of HOFV-cured 
is 1480 cd/m2 at a current density of 825 mA/cm2 (bias: 13.6 V) and the CIE coordinate of

8-4 Summary 
Hyperbranched oligomer (HOFV) containing abundant terminal vinyl groups were 
synthesized from a tri-functional fluorene monomer (F) using the Heck reaction. It was 
soluble in common organic solvents and exhibited good thermal stability (Td > 386oC). 
Enhanced fluorescence efficiency was observed in HOFV, which has been attributed to its 
hyperbranched structure and energy funnel effect. The homogeneity of the HOFV film 
improved greatly with thermal curing at 150oC. Two-layer EL devices 
(ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HOFV-cured or LOFV-cured/Ca/Al) were fabricated and their 
optoelectronic properties investigated. The maximal luminance and luminance efficiency of 
HOFV-cured device were 1480 cd/m2 and 0.18 cd/A, respectively, both were much greater 
than those of linear LOFV-cured device (352 cd/m2 and 0.06 cd/A). Improved EL 
performance in HOFV-cured device has been attributed to its hyperbranched structure with 
terminal cross-linkable vinyl groups. The new tri-functional fluorene (F) and hyperbranched 
oligomer (HOFV) represent useful new monomer and material, respectively, for 
optoelectronic applications.

8. The emission color of poly(fluorenevinylene) devices could be tuned from bluish green 
(HOFV-cured), green (HPFV.08-cap, LPFV, LOFV-cured) to yellowish green 
(HPFV0.04~HPFV0.12, HPFPPV-oxa, LPFPPV-oxa) by manipulation of structures. 
Without end-capping, the EL spectra of HPFV0.04~HPFV0.12 shifted from green 
(HPFV0.08-cap) to yellowish green due to heavy atom effect. By copolymerizing with 
terephthalaldehyde to increase effective conjugation length, the EL spectra of 
HPFPPV-oxa and LPFPPV-oxa shifted from green (HPFV0.08-cap and LPFV0.17) to 
yellowish green. 
9. Compared with the linear counterpart polyfluorenes, the hyperbranched ones possess 
better EL properties due to the following reasons: 
(a) Intermolecular interaction is effectively suppressed by the hyperbranched 
structures. 
(b) Unsymmetrical branches create an energy gradient from outside branches to the 
inside branches to facilitate excitation energy transfer. 
(c) Higher concentration of functional terminal units improves the physical or 
optoelectronic properties.

Introduction 
Recently we have successfully prepared several tri-functional triazole and tri-functional 
fluorene monomers which are potentially applicable to the preparation of hyperbranched 
copolymers. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of new 
hyperbranched polyfluorenes or oligofluorenes from the new tri-functional branching 
monomers. Furthermore, their optical, electrochemical and electroluminescent properties are 
also investigated. 
Experimental  
New hyperbranched copolyfluorenes were prepared from trifunctional (branching) triazole or 
fluorene monomers respectively by the Suzuki coupling, Gilch reaction, Wittig reaction, and 
Heck reaction (Scheme 1). The hyperbranched polymers have been characterized by NMR, 
FT-IR, UV-Vis, GPC, thermogravimetric analysis, and fluorescence spectroscopy.

counterpart, which was prepared from 2,7-bis(bromomethyl)-9,9-dihexylfluorene, to 372 nm 
for the hyperbranched poly(fluorenevinylene)s which degenerates further at higher degree of 
branching. However, the photoluminescence spectra of the hyperbranched films show peaks 
at ca. 467~468 nm which is close to that of the linear film (473 nm), suggesting effective 
photo-excited energy transfer occurs between segments in the hyperbranched samples. The 
maximal luminance (2180 cd/m2) and maximal luminance efficiency (0.89 cd/A) of the 
electroluminescent device using end-capped hyperbranched poly(fluorenevinylene) as 
emitting layer (ITO/PEDOT/polymer/Ca/Al) are superior to those from the linear ones (1452 
cd/m2, 0.47 cd/A) and other hyperbranched polymers without end-capping (184~26 cd/m2, 
0.01~0.09 cd/A). Current results indicate that both hyperbranched structure and end-capping 
contribute to enhanced optoelectronic performance in the poly(fluorenevinylene)s.

Conclusions  
A series of new hyperbranched polyfluorenes were successfully prepared from tri-functional 
fluorene monomers (1-4), which contained triazole or fluorene cores. The influence of the 
hyperbranched structure one their optoelectronic properties were investigated in detail. The 
hyperbranched structures are effective in suppressing intermolecular interaction readily 
occurred in linear polyfluorene. Moreover, functional terminal units (oxadiazole or vinyl) can 
be introduced to improve their physical or optoelectronic properties.

Hyperbranched polyfluorenes containing tri-functional triazole or tri-functional fluorene 
as branch unit were synthesized by Suzuki coupling, Wittig or Heck reactions using the 
A2+A3+B2, A3+B2 or AB2 approaches. The content of branching monomers 
[tris(4-bromophenyl)-1,2,4-triazole or 2,4,7-tris(bromomethyl)-9,9-dihexylfluorene, etc] was 
carefully controlled to prevent gellation. Conjugation length of the copolyfluorenes decreases 
linearly with mol% of the branch unit. A linear relationship between 1/λmax and 1/(1-ntriazole) 
has been correlated (Figure 1, λmax: absorption maximum in film state; ntriazole: molar fraction 
of branching unit in the hyperbranched polymers).  
The hyperbranched structures effectively suppress detrimental excimer formation under 
thermal annealing. Moreover, the maximal brightness and current efficiency of their 
electroluminescent devices were improved greatly with increasing content of tri-functional 
monomer, suggesting that the branch units are effective in improving thermal stability and EL 
performance of polyfluorenes. For hyperbranched oligofluorenes with peripheral vinyl 
terminals, thermal curing led to cross-linked EL polymers with optoelectronic performance 
superior to linear counterparts.
