ABSTRACT 
Decellularized human umbilical arteries represent a candidate scaffolding materials for small 
diameter tissue engineering vascular grafts because of its proper size. Cryopreservation is a 
convenient method for tissue preservation; however, the effects of cryopreservation on 
decellularization of arteries have not been studied. In this study, we investigated the effects of 
cryopreservation on mechanical properties of human umbilical arteries and its effects on 
decellularization of human umbilical arteries. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was selected as 
decellularizing solution and three concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.1, 0.5, and 1 wt%) 
were tested. Fresh arteries and arteries undergoing cryopreservation were subjected to the same 
decellularization protocol. The efficiency of decellularization was evaluated by DNA assay and 
histology every 12 hours up to 48 hours. The mechanical properties of the umbilical arteries 
before and after decellularization were examined. We found that using 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate 
with fresh human umbilical arteries was the most efficient way for cell removing when compare 
to other conditions. Frozen storage caused significant pore formation in tissues. Arteries 
undergoing cryopreservation manifested softer mechanical behavior. Interestingly, 
cryopreservation appeared to decrease the efficiency of cell removal. The histology section 
showed that after 48 hours 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment, there were no nucleus in the 
section of fresh decellularization arteries when there were still nucleus in the section of frozen 
decellularization arteries. The DNA quantification showed the same results that there was no 
residual DNA in decellularization samples prepared from fresh arteries when there were still 0.2 
ng/mg residual DNAs in decellularization samples prepared from arteries undergone 
cryopreservation. The mechanical properties of arteries changed after decellularization process; 
the decellularized human umbilical arteries manifested stiffer mechanical behavior for both fresh

1. INTRODUCTION 
Cardiovascular diseases are the major diseases which cause morbidity and mortality in the 
modern society. Vascular grafts are required for bypass surgeries to restore and preserve functions 
of the downstream tissues. Although synthetic grafts work successfully in replacing 
large-diameter arteries, they are not suitable for small-caliber (<6mm) arteries due to acute 
thrombogenicity and anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (Kannan et al., 2005; Veith et al., 1986). 
Autologous grafts such as the saphenous vein and internal thoracic artery remain the gold 
standard for small-diameter arteries replacement. Unfortunately, many patients do not have 
suitable autologous vessels for bypass surgery because of previous harvest. (Rodriguez et al., 
2012; Veith et al., 1979). To overcome the shortage of donor vessels, a variety of 
tissue-engineering strategies have thus been developed for functional small-diameter vascular 
grafts (see (Gong and Niklason, 2006; Isenberg et al., 2006; Kakisis et al., 2005; Stegemann et al., 
2007; Zhang et al., 2007) for a review). 
Decellularized native tissues, including allografts or xenografts, have been used as scaffolds 
in engineering tissues because of their biocompatibility and mechanical strength. More 
importantly, decellularized native tissues are proven to have potential to repair, grow, and 
remodel in vivo (Borschel et al., 2005; Crapo et al., 2011; Gui et al., 2009). In fact, decellularized 
human umbilical arteries have been used as a scaffolding material for small diameter 
tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) (Abousleiman et al., 2009; Crapo et al., 2011; 
Crouzier et al., 2009; Dahan et al., 2012; Fitzpatrick et al., 2010; Gilbert et al., 2006; Gui et al., 
2009; McFetridge et al., 2004; Rodriguez et al., 2012). Nevertheless, in these studies, the arteries 
were in general frozen for long term storage. Cryopreservation is a convenient method for tissue 
preservation; specifically, vessels are frozen for long term storage in vessel banks (Chow and 
 6
four durations were evaluated. Decellularization durations were from 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 
hours and to 48 hours. Segments were exposed in one of these concentration and duration on 
orbital shaker (100 rpm) at room temperature in 1:20 mass to volume ratio. 
2.3.Histology 
Histology was used to examine the effect of decellularization processes as well as the 
morphology of human umbilical arteries. Segments of native and treated arteries were fixed in 
10% neutral-buffered formalin overnight at room temperature and underwent a series of 
de-hydration treatment, and then embedded in paraffin. Five micron sections were cut on 
positively charged slides using a microtome (Leitz 1512, Leica, Germany). After removal of 
paraffin and re-hydration, samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for 
illustration of nuclei and extracellular matrices. Images were acquired by an optical microscope 
(DM2500M, Leica, Germany) via a CMOS camera (Leica DFC295, Leica, Germany). 
2.4.DNA quantification 
To evaluate the DNA content in the HUA samples, Quant-iT double strain DNA assay kit 
(Invitrogen, USA) were used to quantify residual DNA. Briefly, the samples were lyophilized at 
-40C for 24 hours and then weighted for standardization. The dried samples were digested with 
papain buffer (20 U/mL papain [Worthinton, Lakewood, NJ, USA], 1.1 mM EDTA, 5.5 mM 
cysteine-HCl, and 0.067 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at 60C overnight until samples were fully 
digested. The papain sample solutions were then diluted with TE buffer with content in the DNA 
assay kit. The diluted samples were incubated with the working solution of Quant-iT dsDNA 
assay in a 96-well dish and a fluorometer (Fluoroskan Ascent 5210470, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA) were used to measure the fluorescence of at excitation wave length of 485nm and 
emission wave length of 538nm.

did change the morphologies of HUAs. There were significantly pore formation in the section of 
frozen HUA when compare to the integral matrix in the section of fresh HUA. When compared 
1E and 1F, we found that there were less efficiency in 1% SDS decellularization treatment in 
arteries undergoing cryopreservation since there were still visible nucleus in the section. 
3.2.Efficiency of the Decellularization Protocols 
Figure 2 shows the results of DNA quantification. The DNA contents were normalized with 
dry weight of the samples. Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C are the results from SDS concentration 1%, 
0.5%, and 0.1%. No matter in the fresh arteries groups or arteries undergoing cryopreservation 
groups, the residual DNAs decreased while the duration of decellularization increased as well as 
the SDS concentration increased. There are statistical significant differences between 12 hours 
and 48 hours in all concentration of SDS in both fresh arteries groups and arteries undergoing 
cryopreservation groups, which means the longer duration of decellularization led to better cell 
removal. After 48 hours treatment, there are also significant differences among three 
concentrations, the residual DNA are significantly lower in the 1% SDS groups, which indicated 
that the higher concentration of SDS can also lead to better cell removal. Moreover, the DNA 
quantification results support the histological finding that after 48hours 1% SDS treatment for the 
fresh samples, that there is no residual DNA in the DNA quantification result, which means the 
cells were completely removed in this treatment criterion. Nevertheless, there are still residual 
DNA in the DNA quantification result after 48hours 1% SDS treatment for the frozen samples, as 
the same finding in the histological sections, there are still nucleus in this criterion.  
3.3.Mechanical Properties of HUAs 
Figure 3A shows the mechanical properties of fresh HUAs and HUAs undergoing 
cryopreservation. The pressure-diameter curve shifts to the right after cryopreservation. The 
 10
pressure are similar between these two groups. There are similar results in frozen HUAs and 
frozen DHUAs. The curve shifts to the left after decellularization in the frozen HUA groups, 
indicating the decellularized HUAs prepare from HUAs undergoing cryopreservation (frozen 
DHUA) are significantly stiffer than frozen HUAs. 
 
4. DISCUSSION 
The use of native matrix as a scaffold in tissue engineering requires removal of cells in the 
matrix while preserving extracellular matrices (ECMs). The efficiency of decellularization 
depends on both the origin of the tissue and the methods that are used (Gilbert et al., 2006). For 
example, SDS is one of the common agents for arterial decellularization. There are tremendous 
differences in the concentration of SDS used and the processing time among studies, however 
(Crapo et al., 2011; Crouzier et al., 2009; Gilbert et al., 2006; Gui et al., 2010; Wilshaw et al., 
2012). We, therefore, optimized a decellularization protocol for HUAs as the first step of this 
study. We found from histology and residual DNA quantification that processing in 1% SDS for 
48 hours with shaking completely removed cells in fresh HUAs.  
The SDS solution used in this study is essentially hypotonic. Note that osmic shock is also 
a practical method for decellularization (Crapo et al., 2011; Gilbert et al., 2006). In our 
preliminary experiments we found that the hypotonic SDS solution is far more efficient in terms 
of cell removal compared to isotonic and hypertonic SDS solutions (data not shown). In this 
study we found that more concentrated SDS solution had better efficiency in cell removal. Note 
that Wollmann et al. (2011) showed that concentrated SDS solution may have detrimental effects 
on ECM preservation. Contrary to their study, we did not found obvious difference in 
morphology in histological sections of HUAs treated by different SDS concentrations.

stiffer mechanical properties in the circumferential direction. Venkatasubramanian et al 
(Venkatasubramanian et al., 2006) reported that bovine descending aorta were significantly 
stiffer after cryopreservation because of that bovine descending aortas undergoing 
cryopreservation were in a more aligned state and lead to the stiffer mechanical properties. In our 
study, histology did not show obvious changes in collagen fiber alignment, however. Our results 
may be explained by the formation of ice crystal that disintegrated the microstructure of ECM. It 
was shown that cryopreservation decreased total collagen contained in tissues (Chow and Zhang, 
2011; Wollmann et al., 2011), which may lead to a more compliant mechanical behavior. 
Different types of arteries used in our study might also cause the contradictory results. Porcine 
femoral arteries and bovine descending thoracic aorta (Chow and Zhang, 2011; 
Venkatasubramanian et al., 2006) are the elastic artery which contains numerous elastic lamina, 
HUAs, however, are the muscular artery. It is likely that cryopreservation may have different 
effects on ECM components such as elastin and collagen. Finally, note that we used a custom 
mechanical tester specific for tubular specimen to obtain the mechanical properties of the HUAs. 
Since arteries are structurally anisotropic, testing arteries in their intact form better presents their 
mechanical behavior in physiological condition (Humphrey, 2002).  
Consistent with previous studies (Abousleiman et al., 2008; Amiel et al., 2006; Gui et al., 
2009; Williams et al., 2009), our results showed that the HUAs became significantly stiffer after 
decellularization. The reduced compliance of HUAs after decellularization may be attributed to 
the change in the integrity of ECM (Williams et al., 2009; Wollmann et al., 2011) as well as 
uncrimped collagen fibers (Williams et al., 2009). The loosen structure increased collagen fibers 
mobility and allowed fibers to re-orient easily toward the direction of applied strain (Williams et 
al., 2009). Indeed, previous study shown that the uncrimped collagen fibers are associated with 
 14
Prior to collecting data of mechanical testing, the HUAs were subjected to preconditioning 
(cyclic pressurization between 0 to 150 mmHg for ~10 times). The preconditioning appeared to 
irreversibly damage the microstructure of HUAs, which is unexpected. This is probably because 
HUAs are relatively inmatur and their ECM may not be fully crosslinked (maximum stress=300 
kPa). Nevertheless, after preconditioning, repeatable mechanical behavior was achievable. We 
collected pressure-diameter data from transmural pressure 0 to 150 mmHg; it is significantly 
higher than the normal physiological condition of HUAs (~50 mmHg (Couet et al., 2012)). 
Nevertheless, as a scaffold for tissue-engineered blood vessels, it is necessary to test the 
mechanical behavior at normal physiological blood pressure. Note also that the decellularized 
HUAs can hold a transmural pressure at 150 mmHg without leakage during mechanical testing. 
In fact, Gui et al. reported the burst pressure of decellularized HUAs were ~840 mmHg. 
Therefore, the decellularized HUAs represent a mechanically capable scaffold for fabricating 
small-diameter vascular grafts. 
There are some limitations to our study. We used normal saline instead of a common 
cryoprotectant such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for cryopreservation. It is likely that the use 
of cryoprotectant may reduce ice formation and minimize the detrimental effects of 
cryopreservation. Note, however, that many studies indicated that the different cryoprotectants 
such as DMSO, Krebs-Henseleit solutions, DMEM and fetal bovine serum, reduce 
morphological changes in a frozen process; however, these cyroprotentants hardly prevent the 
changes (Chow and Zhang, 2011; Dahl et al., 2006; Muller-Schweinitzer, 2009; Pascual et al., 
2004; Rigol et al., 2000; Stemper et al., 2007; Venkatasubramanian et al., 2006). In this study, we 
selected SDS solution as the decellularization solution; there are many other kinds of 
decellularization agents worth further investigation.
