Background  
Identifying co-evolving bio-molecules can be useful for annotating their functional roles, predicting 
possible interactions among them, and uncovering complex biological networks for better understanding their 
molecular co-evolution [1]. Previous studies have investigated co-evolution by identifying co-evolving 
nucleotide or amino acid sites. For example, Dutheil et al. inspected 158 sequences of bacterial ribosomal 
RNA, and indicated that more than 95% of the predicted pairs of nucleotide sites coincided with known 
interacting pairs [2]. Travers et al. examined 25 sequences of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), 27 sequences of 
Hsp90, and heat shock–organizing protein (Hop), and identified co-evolving amino acid sites located around 
known functional regions [3]. Pollock et al. analyzed 42 protein sequences of vertebrate myoglobin, and 
detected co-evolving amino acids related to their three-dimensional structures [4]. Wang et al. investigated 
231 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences, and found that the co-evolution of this gene is highly 
correlated with its protein structure and amino acid physicochemical characteristics [5].  
Several computational methods have been devised to understand the aforementioned evolutionary 
interactions and co-evolutionary relationships between mutation sites, including mutual information (MI) 
[6-11], correlation coefficients [2, 3, 12, 13], multiple dependency score [14], and continuous-time Markov 
chains (CTMCs) [4, 5, 15-19]. Among these approaches, MI is probably the most commonly used metric to 
estimate evolutionary correlations [1]. MI combines probability and information theory using a 
logarithm-based representation, to quantitatively measure mutual dependency between two random variables 
[20]. Although MI offers a computational screening method for large number of sequences, previous studies 
have suggested several drawbacks. For example, 125 or more sequences are required to obtain biologically 
significant MI signals [6], a raw MI score can be a poor predictor of co-evolution [6, 7], and the choice of a 
cut-off to assign significance to MI scores is often arbitrary [10].  
Statistical techniques can be incorporated into MI-based co-evolutionary analysis. For example, many 
training sequences can be enumerated to form synthetic datasets based on the co-evolutionary characteristics 
of real sequence datasets. With these synthetic datasets, one may assess the performance for detection of 
statistically significant co-evolution, as well as obtain an MI cut-off for such detection in a systematic manner. 
CTMCs are regularly used to model the evolutionary processes related to biological sequences [4]. Previous 
studies extended CTMCs with a maximum likelihood method to predict RNA secondary structures [15-18], 
and protein-protein interactions [4, 19]. However, Xu et al. [21] indicated that these applications have a 
significant computational cost for estimating the numbers of joint states, and are limited to scaling small 
multiple sequence alignments, for example, 42 protein sequences of vertebrate myoglobin [4], and 231 
cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences [5]. Eyal et al. used the Blocks database to construct a 400 × 
400 pair-to-pair substitution matrix (P2PMAT) to score intra-protein contacts [22] for investigating correlated 
mutations and making structural predictions [23]. All elements in the P2PMAT substitution matrix were 
estimated empirically by counting changes between any two positions in a multiple sequence alignment. The 
estimation of pair-to-pair substitutions from thousands of multiple sequence alignments, each corresponding 
to a protein family in the Blocks database, required significant computational costs.  
Influenza virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide during the past century [24]. 
Novel influenza viral strains form by various mechanisms, including genetic reassortment and accumulation 
of point mutations. Studies showed the existence of specific amino acids related to pathogenicity and 
 6 
from (A3, E4) to (C3, M4) to (D3, F4) than the first pair did from (A1, E2) to (C1, M2) — the numeric subscripts 
represent the corresponding amino acid. This extra switching of an amino acid pair produces a larger MI score 
of 0.37 for positions #3 and #4 according to the original MI formulation (see Materials & Methods, equation 
(3)). MI scores from the first and second pairs are proportional (0.23:0.37, or 2:3) to the number of distinct 
paired residues among these six sequences; two distinct paired residues ((A1, E2) and (C1, M2)) are observed 
in the first pair, while three; (A3, E4), (C3, M4) and (D3, F4), are found in the second pair.  
Following the observation that the original MI formulation would unavoidably increase the score for 
multiple switching of paired residues, we propose that scores be computed using an empirical log-scaled MI 
(MIEm) that changes the base of the logarithm from 20 in the original MI formulation, to be equal to the 
number of distinct paired residues (see Materials & Methods, equation (4)). It is clear from Figure 1 that the 
newly proposed MIEm shares the same value of one, for both the first and second pairs. The figure also shows 
a reduction of MIEm to 0.5 for the fourth pair with respect to the first pair, as opposed to sharing the score of 
0.23 as occurs when applying the original MI measure.  
We also computed two other MI measures — an MI of adaptable logarithmic base (MIAdp) [35], and a 
row-column weighting for the proposed MIEm (RCW MIEm). MIAdp uses a base of the geometric average of the 
number of different amino acid residues individually observed in each aligned position (see Materials & 
Methods, equation (5)), to yield a similar result to that of MIEm. For example, pairs #1 and #2 gave the same 
MIAdp score of 1, and pair #4 took a smaller score than pair #2 did. The second RCW MIEm is based on a 
method by Gouveia-Oliveira et al. [35, 36] (see Materials & Methods, equation (6)) by weighting our 
computed MIEm matrix to provide a new RCW MIEm matrix. While RCW MIEm appears to deliver comparable 
scores as MIEm does, it slightly boosts MIEm scores for pairs #1 (from 1 to 1.17) and #3 (from 0.16 to 0.18) 
while reducing them for pairs #2 (1 to 0.99) and #4 (0.5 to 0.49). From this contrived example alone, however, 
it is hard to see which measure might render a better correlation to the amino acid co-variation. In the next 
section, we describe the development of a synthetic dataset simulated from sequences of interest that can be 
used in discussing and comparing the performance of different MI measures.  
 
Formulating P2PFLU substitution models and generating synthetic datasets for investigating 
co-evolution 
Training datasets of known co-evolutionary characteristics were developed for assessing the performance 
of our proposed MI measure. We implemented a process of generating synthetic alignments to include 
simulation of independent amino acid sites whose residues mutate independently, and dependent (or 
co-evolving) sites in which dependency exists between mutations. We propose a 400 × 400 P2PFLU 
substitution matrix in which two variations are developed, to evaluate substitutions of paired amino acids. We 
call the first one a dependent matrix QDep, with a free parameter δ, to account for the relatedness between 
mutations. The second variation, the P2PFLU substitution matrix, QInd, models paired sites that are mutating 
independently. BEAST with BEAGLE software was then used to generate the required synthetic datasets 
based on these two matrices. For this process we built a consensus maximum clade credibility (MCC) 
phylogenetic tree and estimated the substitution rates from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplings of 
34 influenza A H5N1 PB2 amino acid sequences, as described in Materials & Methods. The resulting PB2 
samples exhibit an average mutation rate of 2.0 × 10-3 substitutions / site / year (1.4 × 10-3 to 3.0 × 10-3, 95% 
highest probability density (HPD) interval)). These statistics were used by BEAST to generate a simulated 
 8 
performance [37], and chose 0.19 as a cut-off value. This gives 1 － specificity = 0.0267 and sensitivity = 1 
for this detection. Similarly, a cut-off value of 18 was selected for RCW MIEm with 1 － specificity = 0.05 
and sensitivity = 0.98. 
 
Co-evolution of 34 PB2 sequences of influenza A H5N1 viruses 
Both MIEm and RCW MIEm measures were applied to the original 34 H5N1 PB2 sequences for detection 
of co-evolving amino acid sites. Scores were evaluated from a total of C(759, 2) = 287,661 paired sites for 
each of the two methods, and residue pairs meeting the prescribed cut-off scores were investigated. Figure 4 
lists various selected amino acid sites that are present in co-evolving groups with top-ranking RCW MIEm and 
MIEm scores. Residues in the same aligned column identical to the first sequence A/Gs/Guangdong/1/96 are 
masked by dots in Figure 4 for easier visualization of their residue substitutions. The top-ranking MIEm was 
0.52, which identified two co-evolving groups – amino acid positions 190, 197, 299, 381, 524, 567, 655, and 
667 in group-1, and positions 93 and 584 in group-2. For the eight group-1 positions, all 28 paired sites (C(8, 
2) = 28) have a computed MIEm of 0.52. In particular, all the secondary residues in each of these eight 
positions were located on four out the five human H5N1 PB2 sequences. Interestingly, these four H5N1 PB2 
sequences having group-1 residues as (R190, N197, K299, M381, M524, E567, A655, and I667) are all from the 1997 
Hong Kong H5N1 viruses, and not from the other human H5N1 viruses with eight completely different 
residues which were from a 2003 Beijing isolate. While the paired sites in group-2 also had a computed MIEm 
of 0.52, their secondary residues (S93, I584) were scattered among four avian viruses, including three isolated 
from duck (Dk) and one from chicken (Ck). The computed MIEm for all paired sites from group-1 and group-2 
sequences were the same, apparently because all of these pairs exhibit the same partitioned amino acid 
substitutions. For example, group-1 positions 190 and 197 contain 30 primary paired residues (K190, K197) and 
four secondary pairs (R190, N197). The same partitioning was found in terms of counting paired residues in 
group-2 positions 93 and 584, including 30 primary paired residues (P93, V584) and four secondary pairs (S93, 
I584).  
We further examined the top-ranking co-evolving sites obtained from RCW MIEm, a weighted version of 
MIEm proposed in this study and based on a description by Gouveia-Oliveira et al. [35, 36], in which their 
weighted MI showed a performance increase over the original MI. Surprisingly, RCW MIEm computed PB2 
248 and 465 in group-3, as the highest scoring pair (Figure 4), to which MIEm ascribed a low score of only 
0.19. This was apparently due to the presence of only one paired substitution (R248, H465) among the 34 
sequences. The top scoring group-1 and group-2 sites predicted by MIEm scored much less than group-3 sites 
provided by RCW MIEm. The computed RCW MIEm scores were even lower for group-1 pairs (24.15) than 
they were for group-2 pairs (59.72), regardless the fact that both group-1 and group-2 sites contain the same 
partition of amino acid transition (30 primary, versus 4 secondary residues).  
Although the ROC plots for RCW MIEm in Figure 3 suggested a comparable AUC to that of MIEm, and a 
better performance over other MI measures, it is noticed that sites ranked high by RCW MIEm (group-3) did 
not describe co-evolution any better than sites identified by MIEm (groups-1 and -2). Moreover, RCW MIEm 
did not produce the same score for amino pairs from group-1 and group-2 pairs as MIEm did. Based on these 
experiments, we conclude that MIEm is most effective among the investigated MI methods in describing amino 
acid co-evolution.  
 
 10 
(248, 465), respectively, with n = 759 for a full-length PB2 protein sequence. As a result, an unexpected large 
RCW MIEm value of 126.33 was obtained for pair (248, 465), compared to a much smaller value of 24.15 for 
the group-1 pairs.  
Recent studies have suggested a number of structural/functional PB2 domains that can be used to 
validate the co-evolving sites we revealed in this study. PB2 is known to interact with PB1 and NP proteins to 
form an RNP complex for enhancing the viral replication efficiency [38, 39]. In Table 1 we show that sites 
(190, 197, 655, 667) in group-1 and (93, 584) in group-2, the two top-scoring co-evolving groups as listed in 
Figure 4, are located in the PB1 and NP binding domains. PB2 is responsible for binding to the cap structure 
of cellular mRNA in the mechanism of cap-snatching too [40-42]. Moreover, host protein RAF-1/Hsp90 has 
been found to interact with PB2 [43, 44] for cytoplasmic-nuclear transportation. We also found site pairs (381, 
567) and (299, 381) in the RNA cap and RAF-1/Hsp90 binding domains, respectively. Finally, sites (567, 655, 
667) are found located in the 627 domain [45], which is characterized as a species-associated domain for 
avian influenza viruses to adapt to human. These observations indicate that those identified co-evolving sites 
all participate in important biological functions, except for PB2 524 which is found strongly co-evolved with 
other group-1 sites and has yet linked to any of the known PB2 domains. According to our analysis, it is 
suggested that PB2 524 may correlate to certain biological functions that are yet to emerge. 
A well-known position for revealing the pathogenicity and adaptation among host species, in addition to 
those functional/structural domains listed in Table 1, is amino acid position 627 of PB2 gene (PB2 627) 
[25–28]; which is found overwhelmingly Lys (K) in human viruses, while in avian viruses it is mostly Glu (E). 
There were two Ks and 32 Es at this PB2 position from the 34 PB2 sequences analyzed earlier. No 
co-evolving site, however, was found related to PB2 627 subject to the MIEm cut-off 0.19 chosen for this 
smaller dataset. We further applied our approach to a larger dataset of 1086 PB2 sequences from all H5N1 
viruses and observed that the sequence counts for E627 and K627 are 843 and 243 respectively. Based on a new 
cut-off value of 0.01 for this dataset, we identified 14 other PB2 sites, namely, positions 451, 649, 368, 147, 
390, 108, 473, 339, 243, 64, 288, 303, 255, and 354 (ordered by their MIEm scores), that each co-evolved with 
PB2 627. Note that the site pair (627, 451) with an MIEm score 0.15 is ranked 5th among all C(759, 2) pairs. As 
shown in Table 2, we further observed that the paired residues for PB2 627 and 451 are mostly (E, I) 
(appearing 815 times), and (K, T) (appearing 189 times). The transition from (E, I) to (K, T) appeared to have 
gone through some other intermediate paired residues, including (E, T) (24 occurrences), (E, V) (three 
occurrences), (E, N) (one occurrence), and (K, I) (54 occurrences).  
While Table 1 shows that most of the top ranking co-evolving sites are located within the known PB2 
domains, the extremely large “functional regions” (total 710 sites out of 759-aa PB2 protein) referenced here 
would likely to result in a high probability of randomly selected sites falling in these domains. To address this 
issue, we additionally found two references that lead us to more concrete definitions of functional sites. Table 
3 lists a comparison of predicted accuracy for previously used “gross” domains in Table 1, as well as other 
two definitions from FLUDB (http://www.fludb.org). The referenced “domains” are based on sequence 
features (SF) for all influenza virus PB2 proteins subject to their functional and structural properties extracted 
from published literature and other database sources. The earlier mentioned larger set of 1086 H5N1 PB2 
sequences that revealed 777 co-evolving paired sites are used for this illustration. Consider that only sites 
exhibiting amino acid residue variation are eligible for “co-evolving” with the other variable site, we chose 
only such sites with their entropy values [20] greater than zero for assessment. Together we have 519 variable 
 12 
sequences that faithfully model the evolutionary characteristics from various proteins.  
Finally, we emphasize the importance of assembling appropriate sequence data to be analyzed. We 
showed that position 627 from all 1086 H5N1 PB2 sequences contained a sufficiently large secondary residue 
K population (243 out of 1086 sequences, or 22.4%) to reveal its co-variation with PB2 451 in the same 
dataset (Table 2). In the earlier 34-sequence dataset that covers only H5N1 viruses from 1996 to 2003, residue 
K only showed up twice (6.9%) along with the other 32 Es, without mentioning that all PB2 451 commonly 
have residue I. No co-evolution was thus determined between these two amino acid positions from this 
smaller dataset. In other words, our analysis pipeline detects co-evolving amino acid sites solely based on the 
complete collection of original sequences (the overall co-evolutionary characteristics are “described” by these 
sequences) to be investigated.  
Conclusions  
Identifying co-evolving amino acid sites for influenza viruses can help better understand the functional 
roles of viral proteins and the possible interactions between amino acids. We introduced a novel P2PFLU 
model and implemented a computational pipeline by combining P2PFLU with BEAST software to generate 
synthetic influenza viral sequences with known dependent and independent paired sites. Upstream of the 
P2PFLU/BEAST pipeline is a consensus MCC tree and statistics from MCMC bootstrapping of real sequence 
data (e.g. 34 influenza A viruses PB2 sequences), so that these simulated sequences contain the molecular 
characteristics of amino acid transitions for influenza A viruses inherited from P2PFLU, and the 
co-evolutionary characteristics sampled from the real influenza viral sequences. These synthetic data are thus 
ideal and specific for describing the statistical properties of various MI measurements for detecting 
co-evolved sites in influenza viral sequences. We proposed a novel MIEm method based on an original MI 
formulation, and using the simulated datasets derived from P2PFLU/BEAST with real viral sequences, 
demonstrated it to be a better method for ROC analysis over other MI measures. With this simulated dataset 
we also determined a cut-off MIEm score, and used it to identify 83 co-evolving sites from a collection of 34 
influenza A H5N1 PB2 sequences. Comparing the two top-scoring groups of co-evolving sites with known 
PB2 domains confirmed that they mostly participate in important biological functions. We further applied this 
approach to identify co-evolving amino acid sites for a larger PB2 sequence set, including 932 avian and 154 
human influenza A H5N1 viruses, and reported 213 co-evolving sites. Among these, PB2 451 was found to be 
co-evolving with PB2 627, the latter has been known as an important species-associated amino acid residue 
for influenza virus replication.

where xa and yb are the states at positions a and b respectively, and Q1 and Q2 are the two substitution models. 
For example, Q1[xa, ya] is a matrix element representing the rate for a state (i.e. amino acid) to change from x 
to y at position a. Naturally, setting δ = 0 recovers the independent model, and taking δ > 0 provides a class of 
models with varying degrees of site-to-site dependency. The FLU, QInd, and QDep models are now publicly 
available in the software package: BEAST version 1.6.1 (http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com). We provided a 
XML script of BEAST version 1.6.1 for generating the synthetic datasets used in this study.  
 
Mutual Information 
MI is one of the most commonly used methods for estimation of the correlation of two amino acid sites 
[10], and is often defined for two positions [20] as:  
 
MI(X,  Y ) = − p(x,  y)log20
p(x,  y)
p(x)p(y)
 
 
 
 
 
 
y∈Y
∑
x∈X
∑ , (3) 
where X and Y are two aligned positions; each position may contain up to twenty types of amino acids, p(x) is 
the frequency of amino acid x appearing at position X, p(y) is the frequency of amino acid y at position Y, and 
p(x, y) the frequency of the amino acid pair x and y at these two positions. A zero MI score means that no 
amino acid transition exists across all participating sequences for the two aligned positions of interest. Greater 
MI values represent stronger co-variation between the pair. We propose a modified MI measure, named MIEm 
that changes the base of the logarithm from 20 to be equal to the number of distinct paired residues. Thus, 
MIEm is conveniently computed by the equation:  
 
MIEm (X,  Y ) =
MI(X,  Y )
log20 # xy
, (4) 
where #xy is the number of distinct pairs observed at any two aligned positions.  
To demonstrate the performance of MIEm, we examined a number of MI measures, including an MI 
method using an adaptable logarithmic base (MIAdp) [35], and the row-column-weighting MI (RCW MI) 
method [35, 36]. MIAdp is defined by equation (5):  
)##(log

YXYXAdp = , (5) 
where #x and #y are the number of different amino acid residues at positions x and y, respectively. RCW MI, 
on the other hand, is a weighted method dependent on the rows and columns of the multiple sequence 
alignment. Given an MI matrix with row a and column b, RCW MI(a, b) is defined as equation (6):

Figure 2 - MIEm distributions of synthetic sequences with varying dependency parameter δ.  
MIEm scores with Jittering were plotted for simulated PB2 sequences using nine different dependency 
parameters δ = 0, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000. Jittering was used to deal with excessive 
overlap of identical scores within a distribution by allowing small left and right movements in the plot for 
better visualization of the distribution. Each MI distribution used 100 synthetic alignments, and each 
alignment contained 380 pairs of amino acid positions.

Figure 4 - Amino acid composition of top-scoring co-evolving sites from 34 influenza A H5N1 
PB2 sequences.  
All of the 28 paired sites from eight group-1 positions, and one pair (93, 584) from group-2 scored a 
top-ranking MIEm = 0.52. Conversely, RCW MIEm scored 126.33 from a different pair (248, 465) of group-3. 
Residues shown with white and blue backgrounds represent the primary and secondary amino acids found in 
aligned columns, respectively. The abbreviations for the four hosts and one region found in strain names are 
listed as follows: Ck = Chicken, Dk = Duck, Gs = Goose, Hu = Human, and HK = Hong Kong. All 5 
human-isolated H5N1 viruses are filled with pink, 11 domesticated avian (chicken) with yellow, and 18 wild 
avian strains with green.

detailing the experiments she has performed that seemed to regulate a couple of 
proteins that are so-called innate sensing receptors, with the existence of H5N1 
supernatants. In the end they were capable of drawing a network of related 
proteins that are involved. One audience from the floor asked if this systems 
biology approach can be applied to study the network of H1N1 infection, which 
could be useful in further understanding its pathogenesis. The answer, of course, is 
‘Yes’.  
2. “A Network of Proteins Regulating H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza 
(HPAI) Viral Polymerase Function in Human Cells” by Eric Bortz of Mount Saini 
School of Medicine. Eric talked about one of the commonly mentioned influenza 
A virus pathogenicity factors – the viral polymerase and vRNA synthesis, that 
appeared to be related to a number of host factors by RNAi probing. They have 
tested two strains – A/Vietnam/1203/04(H5N1) and WSN(H1N1), and found most 
of those interacting proteins are enhancers. Some of them are suppressors, and a 
number of them lead to variable results that appeared to be strain dependent. They 
also found some of these interactions are redundant, meaning that both proteins 
must be present to see the functional changes. In the end a functional interactome 
subnetwork regulating H5N1 and H1N1 was established, which can be used in 
investigating the co-localization of host factors in these infections.  
3. “Evidence for Avian and Human Host Cell Factors that Affect the Activity of 
Influenza Polymerase” by Wendy Barclay of Imperial College London. Wendy 
also talked about polymerase activity of influenza A virus infection. Through 
testing a number of selected host factors, they found that the avian virus 
polymerase is not inhibited by human cell proteins. So there must exist avian host 
factors for enhancing avian influenza polymerase activities. That is, certain avian 
host factors complement polymerase of avian flu virus. They, however, did not 
found such complementary activities through testing of the whole RNP complex. 
So they tried individual protein further, and found that certain human co-factors 
that might be responsible for complementing PB2 627 lysine, making the avian 
virus replicated well in human cells.  
 
Part B – Concurrent Workshop on session on “Mathematical Models: Informing 
Public Health Decisions” 
1. “Association between Influenza A Viral Shedding and Infectivity in Household” 
by Alex Cook of National University of Singapore. This is an epidemiological 
investigation regarding the virus shedding and infectivity, targeting to 
Singaporean households. Although these information have been made known for 
previous seasonal influenza infections, little were known about the pandemic 
 4
airborne? Large vs small aerosols? Seasonality and its interaction/confounding 
effect with behavioral factors or social determinants (such as school closure)? 
Population psycho-behavioral traits and risk communication. All these are to be 
investigated. 
2. “Strategies for Controlling Animal Flu and Its Implication for Human Health” by 
Les Sims, Asia Pacific Veterinary Information Services, Australia.  The main 
theme began with the statement that animal flu is not eradicable, but we can still 
eliminate some strains such as the equine virus in Aus and HPAI H5N1. Although 
some control measures are well described, the problem is when and how to 
implement these measures, which is far too complex. Inappropriate 
implementation is usually harmful for the control. Still, control of animals can 
better prevent illness to human. The problem is that we never have enough 
surveillance and reporting system, and these are actually rather weak in many 
countries. For example, only certain types H5/H7 HPAI are mandatory to report in 
for some countries. Farmers also hesitate to report due to their possible loss of 
profit. They won't decide to control it until their loss may exceed their overall 
profits/advantages. To the end, he concluded that there are two types of AI - those 
many countries decide to live with (e.g., LPAI), and those they intend to eliminate 
(e.g., H5N1). As a result, control measures could vary from place to place.  
 
Part D –Plenary Session on “Virology” 
1. “Molecular Determinants of Transmission and Virulence” by Yoshiro Kawaoka of 
University of Wisconsin. Yoshi is a very famous flu scientist in the past decade. 
He began by reviewing that, before 2008 people in Mexico died were mostly 
children and old, but 2009 pdm caused death all over the ages. That’s the first 
sign of different pathogenicity. For investigating this, they performed infection to 
non-human primate, using 2009 pdm and seasonal flu, with 9 different 
organs/tissues from surface into deep lung. Following what’s been observed in 
pathogenicity, he continued the investigation in molecular level. Specifically, he 
tested a few mutations PB2 627K, 701N, 590S and 591R for PB2 gene, which is 
a famous gene that is known to related virulence. A 2009 pandemic strain (Cal04) 
was used and comparisons were made, including Cal04 vs Cal04PB2627K (wild 
type dominated), Cal04 vs Cal04PB2701N (wild type dominated) and Cal04 vs 
Cal04PB2591Q (wild type dominated, and mutants transmitted well). He has also 
tested H5N1, and oseltamvir-resistant 2009 pdm strains too in a ferret model, and 
discussed about some differences he’s found comparing with some other recent 
publications. 
2. “Virus Receptors and Inter-species Transmission” by Mikhail Matrosovich of 
 6
‘virological’ data, among which the viral genome is definitely one of the most factors. 
Unfortunately, I can still see little Taiwanese scientists in this category in the meeting 
this year. Hopefully I can see more in the next one (venue not yet determined) a few 
years later.
