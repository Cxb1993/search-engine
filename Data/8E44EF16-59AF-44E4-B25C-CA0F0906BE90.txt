Abstract 
LaAlO3 is a promising candidate for gate 
dielectric of future VLSI devices. In this work, 
n-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field- 
effect transistors with LaAlO3 gate dielectric 
were fabricated and the electron mobility 
degradation mechanisms were studied. The 
leakage current density was 7.6×10-5 A/cm2 at 
-1 V. The dielectric constant is 17.5. The 
surface-recombination velocity, the minority- 
carrier lifetime, and the effective capture cross 
section of surface states were extracted from 
gated-diode measurement. The rate of 
threshold voltage change with temperature 
(∆VT/∆T) from 11 K to 400 K is -1.51 mV/K 
and the electron mobility limited by surface 
roughness is proportional to Eeff-0.66. 
I.  
II. I. Introduction 
Recently, many candidates such as 
aluminum oxide (Al2O3) [1-2], zirconium 
oxide (ZrO2) [3-7], hafnium oxide (HfO2) 
[3-7], dysprosium oxide (Dy2O3) [7-10], 
lanthanum oxide (La2O3) [7,10-11], cerium 
oxide (CeO2) [7,11-12], and associated 
aluminates have been introduced as alternative 
gate dielectrics. Lanthanum aluminate 
(LaAlO3) is a potential candidate to achieve 
high dielectric constant (about 30 versus 25 
for HfO2), large energy band gap (5.6 eV), 
high thermal stability (up to 850 °C), large 
conduction band offset (1.8 eV versus 1.4 eV 
for HfO2), low oxygen diffusion coefficient, 
and low lattice mismatch with silicon (less 
than 1.3% versus 5% of HfO2) [11]. Edge et al. 
[13] showed that the thickness of interfacial 
layer between the LaAlO3 films and Si can be 
less than 2 Å. Lu et al. [14] observed that a 
small equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of 1.7 
nm is achieved for a 7.5 nm-LaAlO3 film with 
an effective dielectric constant of 17.2±1 for 
the whole gate stack. However, the LaAlO3/Si 
interfacial properties and the electron mobility 
degradation mechanisms have not been fully 
studied. 
In this work, n-channel MOSFETs with 
LaAlO3 gate dielectric were fabricated and the 
 4
from the IDS-VGS curve is 69.4 mV/dec. The 
density of interface traps (Dit) calculated using 
subthreshold swing (St) is 1.34×1012 cm-2 · 
eV-1. 
(b) Gated-diode Results 
The LaAlO3/Si interfacial properties were 
measured using gated-diodes. Fig. 3 shows the 
IR-VG curves. The surface-recombination 
velocity (s0) is extracted to be 7.01×103 
cm/sec at VR = 1 V. The minority-carrier 
lifetime in the field-induced junction depletion 
region (τ0,FIJ) is 1.09×10-8 s. The effective 
capture cross-section (σs) is 6.37×10-15 cm2. 
(c) Mobility Degradation Mechanisms 
The mobility degradation mechanisms 
such as surface roughness scattering and 
Coulomb scattering were studied [17-18]. Fig. 
4 shows the electron mobility (µeff) as a 
function of Eeff in the temperature range from 
11 K to 400 K. The universal mobility curve is 
also plotted as a reference [18-19]. The 
maximum effective electron mobility of 
nMOSFETs at 300 K extracted by using the 
split-capacitance-voltage technique is 212.6 
cm2/V-s. For surface roughness scattering, an 
approximate relation between electron 
mobility and effective normal field is [18]: 
βµ effeff E∝                                     (2) 
where β is the power exponent. As shown in 
Fig. 4, the electron mobility of the 
LaAlO3-gated nMOSFETs is proportional to 
Eeff-0.66 in the field of 0.93 MV/cm< effE <2.64 
MV/cm at 300 K. The electron mobility of 
nMOSFETs with SiO2 gate dielectric is 
proportional to Eeff-0.3 at an electric field lower 
than 0.5 MV/cm at 300 K. The dependence of 
µeff on Eeff of SiO2-gated nMOSFETs is 
weaker than that of LaAlO3-gated nMOSFETs. 
The difference in this Eeff dependence can be 
attributed to more surface roughness 
scattering at the LaAlO3/Si interface.  
As for Coulomb scattering, the threshold 
voltage VT can be written as [19]:

where φms is work function difference between 
aluminum and silicon substrate, Qf is fixed 
oxide charge, Qm is mobile ionic charge, Qot is 
oxide trapped charge, Qit is interface trapped 
charge, and qψB is the energy difference 
between the Fermi-level EF and the intrinsic 
Fermi-level Ei in silicon. Because φms, Qm, Qf, 
and Qit are essentially 
temperature-independent, differentiating

The inset of Fig. 4 shows the threshold 
voltage (VT) versus temperature (T) in the 
temperature range from 11 K to 400 K. The 
rate of change of threshold voltage with 
temperature (∆VT/∆T) is -1.51 mV/K. The 
comparable rate for SiO2-gated MOSFETs is 
about -1 mV/K at a substrate doping of 1016 
cm-3 [20]. The change of threshold voltage 
with temperature (∆VT/∆T) is related to the 
rate change of Qot. The increasing positive 
oxide trapped charges with temperature are 
the source for the threshold voltage shift. 
Since the threshold voltage decreases with 
increasing temperature, the inversion charge 
density Qinv increases with increasing 
temperature at the same VGS. The more the 
electrons reside in the inversion layer, the 
more the scattering due to Coulomb scattering 
[21]. Since the ∆VT/∆T values for these two 
types of transistors are of the same order of
