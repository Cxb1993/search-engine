英文摘要 
 
Neuromuscular injuries of the upper extremity due to work activities occur in a variety of 
industries, jobs, and specific tasks.  Among various factors, improper posture, excessive 
manual forces, and high rate of manual repetitions are the major factors of cumulative trauma 
disorders (CTDs).  Ergonomics guidelines developed for reducing occurrence rate of CTDs 
gradually focus on integrating variables of physical workload including exposure time, 
exposure level, and repetitiveness.  Research concerning long-term data collection of 
physical workload at a job field and quantification of the collected data can facilitate the 
development of CTD prevention programs. 
We proposes a 3-year study to establish a quantitatively assessment system for workload 
of computer tasks.  In the first year of study, techniques of computer interface and data 
logging achieved from previous researches were merged to develop a logging device, 
unaffected by environmental conditions, for computer inputs from both keyboard and mouse. 
Companion software with auto-processing function was developed to quantify repetitiveness 
from collected data.  In the second year of study, a batch of logging devices were made to 
quantify workload of various computer tasks (VDT work).  Task workers were interviewed 
to identify work related issues including strains caused by the work.  Collected information 
was combined with quantified workload to contrast the ergonomic risk of evaluated tasks.  
In the third year of study, a series of laboratory experiment was completed to determine 
differences in biomechanical workload across computer input tasks.

1. Introduction 
Prolonged computer use is positively associated with work-related upper extremity 
disorders (Bergqvist et al., 1995; Schreuer et al., 1996; Matias et al., 1998; Jensen et al., 2002; 
Blatter and Bongers, 2002; Szeto et al., 2005). Video display terminal (VDT) users have 
reported pain in the hands, wrists and arms that exceeds pain in other body parts (Rempel et 
al., 1999; Sauter et al., 1991). Szabo (1998) indicated that 21% of work-related carpal tunnel 
syndrome (CTS) cases were attributed to repetitive data entry activities. Jensen et al. (1998) 
showed that musculoskeletal symptoms are more prevalent for the arm and hand operating a 
mouse than for the other arm or hand. Two studies conducted by NIOSH identified a 
relationship between keyboard usage and cumulative trauma disorder (CTD) symptoms 
(Fagarasanu and Kumar, 2003). These studies suggested that percentage of time typing, 
typing speed, and force were factors likely associated with CTD. Factors implicated in the 
development of a CTD are insufficient recovery time, highly repetitive tasks, awkward 
posture and high force (Silverstein et al., 1996; Putz-Anderson, 1988). When these factors are 
combined, the risk of developing a CTD is high.  
 
According to a literature survey by Fagarasanu and Kumar (2003), data entry 
(keyboarding) risk factors associated with CTS include repetitiveness, typing speed, typing 
force, keyboard height, awkward postures, keyswitch make force and keystroke activation 
force. Fagarasanu and Kumar also indicated that a high ulnar deviation, wrist velocity, range 
of motion and percentage of maximal force applied to a mouse generate a higher risk for CTS 
in women than in men. High carpal tunnel pressure while dragging and pointing a mouse was 
implicated in increased risk of CTS in the hands (Keir et al., 1999). Laursen and Jensen (2000) 
demonstrated that double-clicking caused the highest muscular workload during VDT usage. 
Many human factors and occupational epidemiological studies have investigated the health 
effect of VDT operation on the musculoskeletal system of users. Gerr et al. (1996) identified 
that these studies have methodological limitations, inconsistent results and limited 
conclusions. Human factor studies are usually limited by relatively small sample sizes, short 
exposure durations, and reliance on outcome measures with unknown relevance to chronic 
adverse health effects. Gerr et al. suggested that objective methods should be used when 
assessing exposure and health outcomes.  
 
Some studies utilized self-reported questionnaires (Bergqvist et al., 1995; Blatter and 
Bongers, 2002; Foglemana and Lewis, 2002; Jensen et al., 2002; Schlossberg et al., 2004; 
Lassen, 2004), whereas others employed video-based observations or software-based loggers 
to objectively assess VDT use and potential risks associated with VDT tasks (Matias et al., 
1998; Chang et al., 2007; Douwes et al., 2007; Blangsted et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2004). 
Comparatively few studies have utilized external loggers to record computer input activities 
(Homan and Armstrong, 2003). Questionnaires can overestimate actual computer use 
(Douwes et al., 2007; Homan and Armstrong, 2003). Video-based observations are generally 
time-consuming. Additionally, this observation-based analytical method relies on the 
subjective judgment of researchers and is unsuitable for analyzing high-speed movement and 
bulk data. Software-based loggers are low cost, can be easily installed on workstations and 
generate more accurate data than questionnaires. Nevertheless, monitoring software can 
decrease computer efficiency. Additionally, some software functions resemble computer 
spyware and can be detected and blocked by anti-virus software. Due to the shortcomings of 
common assessment tools, a tool that efficiently and accurately monitors VDT use and

Fig.2 Logger hardware architecture 
 
Each registered data record included an 8-bit code representing the activity event 
(keystroke, mouse click, mouse movement), a 32-bit number indicating event time (year, 
month, date and time (in milliseconds)), and three combined 8-bit numbers indicating 
key/mouse button status, key code, direction and distance the mouse was moved. The system 
reliability and data accuracy of the proposed logger has been validated in laboratory during 
the stage of hardware and software development. 
 
2.1.2 Characteristics of Analytical Software 
The registered data was downloaded from the CF card to a PC via a card reader to 
compute the total number of keystrokes, mouse clicks, scrolling counts, and distance the 
mouse moved using a LabVIEW-based program called KMlog. The KMlog software detects 
and passes over command codes sent from a PC to a keyboard and mouse. Keystroke 
command codes repeatedly generated by continuously holding down a key are also detected 
and dropped automatically by KMlog. The KMlog software computes total dynamic, static 
and resting durations associated with computer use based on time intervals of adjacent records. 
The time intervals were set to 5 seconds and 30 seconds to differentiate computer use time 
into dynamic (<5s), static and resting (>30s) durations based on the settings of WorkPace

2.2.1 Keyboarding 
Ten male undergraduate participants typed at 4 preset speeds (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 keys/s) and 
4 self-selected speeds (slow, medium, fast and very fast) for 3 minutes. The highest preset 
typing speed of 4 key/sec was used in the keyboarding test to contain the normal typing speed 
of 230 keys/min indicated by Szeto et al. (2005). Each participant completed one trial at each 
speed by typing their preferred keys. Composite keystrokes, 2 keys pressed simutaneously, 
was allowed under the 4 key/s or very fast input rates. The preset speeds were selected to 
determine whether the number of keystrokes counted by the proposed logger and WorkPace 
equaled 90, 180, 360, and 720 keys/3 minutes at preset speeds of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 keys/s, 
respectively. A metronome was used to pace the participants in the preset-speed tests. No 
participants chose to type more than 2 keys in the preset speed tests. The self-selected speeds 
were employed to compare effectiveness of the logger and WorkPace when registering 
keystrokes at various and high typing speeds. In each self-selected speed test, the participants 
were asked to simulate regular typing by using single or multiple fingers at a subjectively 
determined speed. Typing performance and typing context were not emphasized in this study. 
In consequently, the participants were allowed to randomly type any keys they like. 
 
2.2.2 Mouse clicking and moving 
Ten male undergraduate participants performed the mouse clicking tasks under 3 
self-selected speeds (slow, medium, and fast) for 3 minutes. During each test, no restrictions 
were placed on which buttons were clicked. Mouse movement was measured using 3 preset 
speeds (0.25, 0.5, and 1 cycle/s) and 3 self-selected speeds (slow, medium, and fast) for 3 
minutes. Each participant was told to move mouse back and forth laterally with the cursor 
stroke > 1/3 screen width and without allowing the cursor to touch the screen edges. In each 
preset-speed test, the participants were paced using a metronome. In the self-selected speed 
tests, each participant subjectively selected a pace based on his experience. The 
mouse-clicking task was used to compare the effectiveness of the logger and WorkPace in 
counting mouse clicks at various input rates. A mouse-movement task was undertaken to

missed more keystrokes and composite keystrokes at high input speeds than the logger. 
Thirteen records out of 80 did not match. In all these cases, WorkPace registered fewer 
keystrokes than the logger. The number of keystrokes counted by WorkPace was on average 
0.4% less than those counted by the logger when typing rate was ≤ 3.9key/s (700 keys/3 min), 
and 10.3% less when typing rate was >3.9key/s (not shown in table). To achieve the preset 
speed of 4 key/s, 5/10 participants utilized composite keystrokes. In these trials, WorkPace 
missed on average 32% keystrokes (not shown in table). At the self-selected very fast speed, 
all participants except 1 chose to type with multiple fingers rather than typing two keys 
simultaneously. When the typing rate exceeded 200 key/min without composite keystrokes, 
average number of keystrokes counted by WorkPace was only 1.1% less than that counted by 
the logger.

Similarly, WorkPace missed more mouse clicks at a high clicking rate than did the logger. 
WorkPace registered on average 27.8% fewer mouse clicks than did the logger when the click 
rate was ≥ 3.2 click/s, and only 0.7% fewer when the click rate was <2.5 click/s (Fig. 3). A 
nonlinear relationship exists between the distance a cursor moved (in pixels) as registered by 
WorkPace and mouse movement (in mickeys) obtained by the logger (Fig. 4).

Table 3 lists test results for online gaming (7 participants, A–G) and document processing 
(7 participants, H–N). Due to software conflicts and some technical problems, WorkPace 
failed to function during 2 online gaming tests and 1 document-processing test. The logger 
registered more keystrokes and mouse clicks than WorkPace except in one 
document-processing test. In this exceptional case (participant I) WorkPace recorded 3.6% 
more keystrokes than the logger. However, another document-processing case (participant H) 
showed that WorkPace missed 13.1% of mouse clicks. The average percentage of keystrokes 
and mouse clicks missed by WorkPace was 7.7±2.0% (range [4.4%, 9.7%]) and 3.3±3.3% 
(range [0.04%, 8.7%]), respectively, in online gaming tests, and was 4.0±4.9% (range [-3.6%, 
8.9%]) and 4.6±4.7% (range [0.7%, 13.1%]), respectively, in document processing tests. The 
logger counted on average 20,603 keystrokes and 10,147 mouse clicks per day in the online 
gaming tests, and on average 4,085 keystrokes and 3,550 mouse clicks per day in the 
document-processing tests. Notably, all online gamers reported sore fingers and wrists at the 
end of the prolonged tests, and one (participant C) stopped the test in 3.2 days due to pain in 
his dominant wrist. Only one online game player completed the eight-day prolonged test. 
 
The average duration of dynamic plus static periods per day in the online gaming task 
was 5.31–11.97 hour/day, and that in the document-processing task was 2.20–4.02 hour/day 
(Table 4). The typing and mouse clicking speeds registered by the logger were both 
significantly greater than those registered by WorkPace (p<0.01, Wilcoxon). The average 
typing and mouse clicking speeds in online game test registered by the logger were 40.3±9.9 
keystroke/min (range [29.0, 55.2]) and 20.2±6.6 click/min (range [5.8, 25.9]), respectively. 
For the document-processing test, the typing and mouse clicking speeds determined by the 
logger were 19.6±6.3 keystroke/min (range, 13.2–27.7) and 18.3±6.5 click/min (range, 
9.9–25.4), respectively.

indicates distribution of keystrokes. Bottom tables list temporal and spatial parameters

Typing behaviour such as use of composite keys can result in significantly divergent 
accuracy of recorded keyboard activities by using a software-based logger. This was 
demonstrated by that, at the preset speed of 4 key/s, 5 participants applied composite 
keystrokes to keep their rate consistent and resulted in WorkPace missing 32% of keystrokes. 
Comparatively, at self-selected speeds up to 200 keys/min without composite keystrokes, the 
percentage of keystrokes missed by WorkPace declined to 1.1%, which is considered 
acceptable. Typing behaviour together with several factors may also result in a large variation 
in experimental values between the participants in integrated input tasks. Factors such as the 
nature of the task, input speed, hardware specification of PC, use of differnet resident 
software, exposure time and work schedule during test period can contribute further to the 
observed variation between participants. The integrated input test was performed without 
controlling these factors, so that the actual computer activities of tested participants would be 
represented accurately. Although the exact effect of each uncontrolled factor was not known, 
the conclusions drawn from the experimental results were consistent. Experimental results 
demonstrate that the proposed external logger is more accurate than WorkPace at counting 
keystrokes and mouse clicks at a high input rate. This analytical finding may apply to other 
software-based loggers. Nevertheless, utilizing computer software is cost-effective as 
software can conveniently obtain large samples and assess computer input activities (Chang, 
2004). The use of a software-based logger should be limited to tasks with low input rates (e.g., 
<200 key/min). 
 
In this study, to assess the risk factors associated with online gaming, the obtained mean 
typing and clicking rates (40.3 keystroke/min and 20.3 click/min) were not considered highly 
repetitive according to Kilbom’s guidelines (1994) for finger movement frequency (>200 
motions/min). However, Fagarasanu and Kumar (2003) determined that highly repetitive 
 14
Unlike a software-based logger, this external logger is not confined by computer systems and 
can be applied to computers running various operating systems. Furthermore, estimating from 
the highest storage rate of participant E, a 1GB CF card can continuously store data up to 60 
workdays. The only known flaw of the proposed logger is that it cannot record input activities 
from remote input devices. For instance, if a computer is operated using a remote desktop 
connection, then the input activities of keyboard and mouse can only be registered using a 
software-based logger running on the computer, and not using an external logger attached to 
computer being accessed. 
 
4.4 Applications of proposed logger 
With adequate effectiveness and long-term logging capability, the proposed logger can be 
utilized in prospective studies to record mouse and keyboard usage for various professions 
with potential risk factors. Furthermore, specific physical and psychological conditions can be 
monitored using a conventional instrument. For instance, a multi-transducer logger can be 
synchronized with this proposed external logger to record muscle activity, joint posture, or 
speed of movement of the upper extremities (Liu et al., 2006). This logger can provide 
specific indicators of computer input activities, such as frequency and rate of 
typing/clicking/scrolling, time holding a key and mouse button, distance and speed of mouse 
pointing/dragging, and durations of static and dynamic time. A comparison can be made to 
determine whether any pattern of computer input is associated with a specific physical and/or 
psychological condition (Chang, 2004). Moreover, the computer use of a user can be highly 
portable via the use of a personal CF card and computer with an external logger. Amell and 
Kumar (1999) indicated that people are spending a considerable amount of their free time in 
front of a computer due to Internet use and the boundless possibilities of communication and 
information computers provide to individuals. This scenario may further decrease the 
likelihood of finding a direct relationship between computer use and CTDs in the workplace. 
The proposed logger is an effective tool for quantifying personal exposure with portability.  
 
4.5 Limitations of study 
This study was restricted by the small numbers of subjects and tasks. Factors including 
typing behaviour, computer task nature, PC specification, software environment and work 
schedule were not controlled, making the exact impact of a particular factor on the 
experimental observations unclear. Further experimental design is needed to uncover how 
individual factors might affect the result of a tool in assessing computer use. Larger sample 
sizes of both subjects and tasks are stipulated to generalize the experimental observations 
obtained in this study.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This study demonstrates that the proposed logger effectively measures computer input 
activities, thereby providing accurate data than a software-based logger in assessing computer 
usage. The logged data from online game players provide some indicators of their physical 
condition. The proposed logger can be applied to VDT related ergonomic studies for 
professions with concerns of health effects. Further study is necessary to explore the 
relationship among indicators of computer activities, physical and psychological condition.

Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH, USA) identified a relationship between 
keyboard usage and cumulative trauma disorder (CTD) symptoms (Fagarasanu and Kumar, 
2003). These studies suggested that percentage of time spent typing, typing speed, and force 
were factors likely correlated with CTDs. Factors implicated in the development of a CTD are 
insufficient recovery time, highly repetitive tasks, awkward posture and high force 
(Silverstein et al., 1996; Putz-Anderson, 1988). When these factors are combined, the risk of 
developing a CTD is high. 
 
According to a literature review by Fagarasanu and Kumar (2003), data-entry 
(keyboarding) risk factors associated with CTS were repetitiveness, typing speed, typing force, 
keyboard height, awkward postures, keyswitch make force and keystroke activation force. 
Fagarasanu and Kumar also determined that a marked ulnar deviation, wrist velocity, range of 
motion and percentage of maximal force applied to a mouse increase risk for CTS more in 
women than in men. High carpal tunnel pressure while dragging and pointing a mouse was 
implicated in increased risk of CTS in the hands (Keir et al., 1999). Laursen and Jensen (2000) 
demonstrated that double-clicking caused the highest muscular loading during VDT usage. 
Many human factor and occupational epidemiological studies have investigated the health 
effects of VDT operation on the musculoskeletal systems of users. However, Gerr et al. (1996) 
identified that these studies have methodological limitations, inconsistent results and limited 
conclusions. Gerr et al. suggested that objective methods should be adopted when assessing 
computer exposure and health outcomes. 
 
Many studies have utilized different tools to quantify computer exposure. Some studies 
utilized self-reported questionnaires (Bergqvist et al., 1995; Blatter and Bongers, 2002; 
Foglemana and Lewis, 2002; Jensen et al., 2002; Schlossberg et al., 2004; Lassen, 2004), 
whereas others attempted to objectively assess VDT use and potential risks associated with 
VDT tasks by employing video-based observations or software-based loggers (Matias et al., 
1998; Blangsted et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2007; Douwes et al., 2007). 
Notably, questionnaires can overestimate actual computer exposure (Homan and Armstrong, 
2003; Heinrich et al., 2004; Mikkelsen et al., 2007; Douwes et al., 2007), and video-based 
observations are generally time-consuming. Additionally, this observation-based analytical 
method relies on researcher subjective judgment and is inappropriate for analyzing high-speed 
movements and bulk data. Software-based loggers are low cost, can be easily installed on 
workstations, and generate more accurate data than questionnaires. Nevertheless, Chen et al. 
(2009), who developed a hardware logger system for recording computer input activities, 
demonstrated that monitoring software can decrease computer efficiency and likely has 
shortcomings compared to hardware loggers.  
 
To date, many studies determined computer exposures based on ‘computer use time’ 
according to predefined pause definitions (Homan and Armstrong, 2003; Blangsted et al., 
2004; Heinrich et al., 2004; Mikkelsen et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2007). Although estimated 
computer use time can be affected by the pause definition used (Richter et al., 2008), a strong 
relationship exists between computer use time and risk of musculoskeletal symptoms. 
However, different computer tasks may have different times spent typing, mouse clicking, and 
mouse dragging. Determining computer exposure only by total computer use time may be 
insufficient for discovering differences in physical workload between one occupation and 
another. Therefore, this study determined whether the commonly used computer use time can 
represent accurately the physical workload of different computer tasks. A novel hardware 
 20
2.2 Equipment and test procedure 
Three sets of logger systems developed by Chen et al. (2009) were utilized to record 
subject computer activities. The system consists of a hardware logger and KMlog analytical 
software. The computer activities of each subject were recorded for 10 consecutive days. The 
research goals were explained, and detailed instructions were given to all participants before 
data collection. Participants provided informed consent before participating in the study. Each 
participant filled out a short questionnaire, modified from a previous study of Yun et al. 
(2001). The survey collected data on personal characteristics, computer use, and subjective 
feelings about regional pain during the past year. Pain in the neck, shoulders, arms, wrists and 
hands, and upper and lower back areas were recorded. Response categories were “no pain,” 
“mild pain,” “discomforting,” “distressing,” and “intense” scored on a scale from 0 to 4 
(Table 1). 
 
Each test run was started on a weekday by an investigator who installed and initiated the 
hardware logger on each subject’s computer at 8:00 a.m. Data recording continued for 10 
consecutive days and was stopped by the investigator on day 10 at  6:30 p.m. If day 10 was 
not a weekday, the logger was stopped on the following Monday at 8:00 a.m. During each test, 
the same keyboard, mouse set (Cordless Desktop EX111, Logitech, Taiwan) and gain settings 
were applied to each test PC. Each participant then performed regular work-rest activities 
during the test period. The unobtrusive nature of the installed logger ensured that subjects 
quickly forgot that they were being monitored. Therefore, participants did not likely alter their 
work patterns as a consequence of participating in this study. 
 
2.3 Data processing 
Parameters derived by KMlog software from recorded computer activities consist of 
number of workdays, total dynamic and static durations, total keystrokes, mouse click counts, 
wheel scrolling counts, mouse movement and distance dragged (in 1000*mickeys), average 
typing and clicking rates, and average time holding down keys and mouse buttons. The 
KMlog software computes total dynamic, static and resting durations associated with 
computer use based on time intervals of adjacent records. The time intervals (pause 
definitions) were set to 5 seconds and 30 seconds to categorize computer use time as dynamic 
(<5s), static or resting (>30s) durations (Chen et al., 2009). Additionally, the dynamic 
durations (DD) for the keyboard and mouse usage were computed individually based on time 
intervals of adjacent keyboard records and mouse records, respectively (Fig. 1). Average daily 
exposures were computed by dividing the above PC usage parameters by the number of 
workdays measured during the 10-day survey period. Average typing and clicking rates 
(number/second) were calculated by dividing the total number of keystrokes and clicks by 
overall keyboard DD and mouse use DD, respectively. 
 22
(p<0.0005) (Table 2). Administrators had an average keystroke rate of 7785 strokes/day, 
roughly 4 times that of CAD draftsmen. Conversely, the draftsmen had an average mouse 
click rate of 6593 clicks/day and mouse movement rate of 1741.7 k mickeys/day, which were 
approximately 2-fold those of administrators. A significant difference existed between groups 
in durations spent mousing and keyboarding. Although the total duration spent on the 
computer was not significantly different between groups, administrators had significantly 
longer daily keyboard DD (p<0.005) and shorter daily mouse DD (p<0.0001) than draftsmen 
(Table 2). The daily keyboard DD for administrators (0.862 hour/day) was 235% of that for 
draftsmen (0.367 hour/day), while daily mouse DD for administrators (2.289 hour/day) was 
only 57% of that for draftsmen. Moreover, mouse DDs were significantly longer than 
keyboard DDs for both groups (p<0.0001), 2.6-fold for administrators and 10.8-fold for 
draftsmen; however, keyboard DDs were not significantly different from static durations. 
Administrators had a significantly faster typing rate than draftsmen (p<0.0001); however, the 
two groups did not significantly differ in clicking rates (Table 2). The average time holding 
down a key for draftsmen (0.227 sec/keystroke) was longer than that for administrators (0.137 
sec/keystroke); however, this difference was insignificant (p=0.007). No between-group 
difference existed for time spent holding the mouse buttons while clicking.

For the administrators, stepwise regression shows that the daily computer duration 
(dynamic + static) was strongly correlated with daily keyboard DD (p<0.002), typing rate 
(p<0.001) and daily mouse DD (p<0.001) (Eq. 1). 
 
Computer duration (hr/day) = −0.569 + 0.491*keyboard DD (hr/day) + 0.555*typing rate 
(keystrokes/sec) + 1.071*mouse DD (hr/day)  (F=148.8, p<0.001, adjusted r2=0.976) 
        (Eq. 1) 
 
However, daily computer duration was strongly correlated with only mouse DD (p<0.001) 
for the draftsmen, as shown in Eq. 2. 
 
Computer duration (hr/day) = 0.533 + 1.056*mouse DD (hr/day)  (F=135.5, p<0.001, 
adjusted r2=0.924)         (Eq. 2) 
 
For all subjects, the daily distance the mouse was dragged exponentially, not linearly, 
increased as the distance the mouse moved daily increased. Figure 6 shows the log-linear 
scatter plot of daily mouse-drag distance and mouse-move distance with a power regression 
line (Eq. 3). Equation 3 suggests that an increase of 1000k mickeys/day mouse move likely 
triples the amount the mouse is dragged. This observation also explains why the average 
distance the mouse was moved daily for draftsmen, approximately 858k mickeys/day (98%) 
greater than that of the administrators; however, the average distance a mouse was dragged 
for draftsmen was 3-fold that for the administrators. 
 
Drag = 17.6755 * e (0.0011 * Move) (F=48.6, p<0.001, adjusted r2=0.674)   
                (Eq. 3) 
 
Table 4 summarizes significant Spearman correlation coefficients between computer 
exposure parameters and ratings of regional pain. The rating of neck pain was positively 
correlated with average time for which the mouse buttons were held down (r=0.467, p<0.05). 
The ratings of dominant shoulder pain were significantly correlated with total dynamic and 
static duration (r=0.505, p<0.05), static duration (r=0.427, p<0.05), mouse DD (r=0.418, 
p<0.05), keyboard DD (r=-0.414, p<0.05), typing rate (r=-0.431, p<0.05), and wheel scroll 
(r=0.524, p<0.01). The ratings of upper back and lower back pain were both significantly 
correlated with static duration (upper back: r=0.492, p<0.05; lower back: r=0.470, p<0.05). 
The ratings of the other regional pains were not correlated with any collected computer 
exposure parameters.

4. Discussion 
Onsite measurement results have shown that significant group differences exist in 
keyboard and mouse use of administrators and CAD draftsmen. Several studies also have 
identified differences in the amount of time spent using a mouse and keyboard among 
individuals (Heinrich et al., 2004; Mikkelsen et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2007). Many studies 
determined that increased duration of computer use is positively associated with increased 
risk of musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g., Gerr et al., 2004; Village et al., 2005; IJmker et al., 
2007). However, how to develop effective indices of computer use for predicting risk of 
related MSD is not well defined. Regression results indicate that the duration of computer use 
between two different professions cannot be accurately represented by only one formula using 
the same set of quantified parameters associated with mouse and keyboard activities. This 
observation further suggests that computer exposure of different tasks may not be based solely 
on duration of computer use. Cooper and Straker (1998) reported differences in shoulder 
muscle activity when operating a mouse and keyboard. Dennerlein and Johnson (2006), who 
compared wrist, arm and shoulder exposure for five common computer tasks, determined that 
different biomechanical risk factors are associated with different computer tasks. Different 
computer tasks can be associated with different computer use patterns. Therefore, workloads 
or health risks may differ among computer professions; even those with similar computer use 
durations. Thus, detailed information of computer use is required to accurately estimate the 
workload of a computer user. 
 
Richter et al. (2008) demonstrated that the use of different pause definitions (cutoff) can 
generate different estimations of computer use duration. They identified a shallow, log-linear 
relationship between pause definition and estimated computer use duration. According to their 
study, doubling the pause definition results in an increase of only 3.5% in computer use 
duration for the pause definitions examined (1–120s). Several studies applied a 30-second 
threshold to estimate computer work duration (Homan and Armstrong, 2003; Blangsted et al., 
2004; Heinrich et al., 2004; Mikkelsen et al., 2007). Previous studies indicated that a pause 
definition of 20–30 seconds yields work times that reasonably correspond to work times 
reported by observers (Homan and Armstrong, 2003; Heinrich et al., 2004). Chang et al. 
(2008) demonstrated that computer activity cutoffs in the range of 28–60 seconds provided 
unbiased estimates of computer use duration. They suggested that researchers use a 30-second 
cutoff to improve comparability of past and future studies. This study applied a 5-second 
cutoff for assessing dynamic keyboard use and mouse use and a 30-second cutoff for 
assessing the duration of overall computer use. Analytical results indicate that the overall 
computer durations of administrators and draftsmen were primarily associated with dynamic 
mouse use (administrators, 61%; draftsmen, 84%). The static duration (5–30 sec) only 
accounted for 12% and 20% of overall computer duration for draftsmen and administrators, 
respectively. This observation echoed findings obtained by Slijper et al. (2007) and Richter et 
al. (2008), who noted that the distribution of pause durations was extremely skewed and 
pauses with long durations are unlikely. 
 
An overlap of mouse DD and keyboard DD was observed due to integrated operation of 
the mouse and keyboard or quickly switching between these devices. This overlap was <5% 
of overall computer duration for both groups. According to Richter et al. (2008), the summed 
work duration of mouse and keyboard use can become much longer (approximately 17%) 
than overall computer use when the 30-second cutoff was used to individually assess mouse 
and keyboard use. Comparatively, adopting two cutoffs to separate computer use into 
 30
upper-limb symptoms. Chang et al. (2007) used a 60-second cutoff for estimating computer 
usage of 27 undergraduate students. They reported that daily computer usage exceeding 3 
hours in duration was strongly correlated with particular musculoskeletal symptoms. In this 
study, both work groups worked at a computer daily for more than 3 hours, even when a 
relatively shorter cutoff value of 30 seconds was used. The subjective feeling of pain and 
discomfort among test participants are likely related to prolonged computer use. However, 
this study only found a slightly, but not significantly, higher complaint rate for the dominant 
body parts of CAD draftsmen than that of administrators. This non-significant finding may be 
limited by the small sample size, un-matched gender constitution or uncontrolled factors such 
as work posture and job stressors. Future studies should be carefully designed to uncover the 
risk factors for MSDs caused by prolonged mouse usage. 
 
In addition to computer use duration, this study quantitatively reports the detailed 
computer activities of two computer work groups. No study has quantitatively determined 
computer activities of a particular profession for an extended period. Although data were 
collected for less than 10 days, these data serve as a basis for comparison with computer 
activities of other computer work groups. Other professions, such as programmers, graphic 
designers, computer engineers, typesetters, and call center and data entry workers may also be 
at high risk for musculoskeletal disorders due to prolonged computer use (Jensen et al., 2002). 
Due to professional training, such computer workers are less likely to alter their work 
practices even when starting new jobs. Thus life-time computer exposure can be estimated by 
recording computer activities over a suitable period. 
 
The lack of standardized computer-exposure metrics limits comparisons of findings 
across studies (Punnett and Wegman, 2004). Reliable tools for accurately measuring both 
keyboard and mouse uses are required to quantify the exposures of various computer tasks 
(Chen et al., 2009). With proper control over risk factors such as work posture, gender 
constitution and levels of work stress, monitoring tools for computer activities can shed light 
on the complex dose-response relationship in future studies. Chang et al. (2008) further 
suggested that additional information about physical exposure might be needed to construct a 
comprehensive exposure profile when studying MSDs. Future studies should integrate 
adequate monitoring tools for computer activities with task-based exposure estimates, as 
Dennerlein and Johnson (2006) did in determining which physical factors are related to risk of 
MSDs. 
 
Conclusions 
This study analyzed the computer activities of twelve university administrators and 
twelve CAD draftsmen. Experimental results derived from onsite measurements indicate that 
computer use duration alone cannot accurately represent the workloads of various computer 
tasks. Adequate tools are needed for quantifying user computer exposure and providing 
detailed information for various computer tasks. To better understand computer-associated 
risk for MSDs, we recommended that future studies quantitatively measure computer 
activities for an extended period.

Abstract 
In order to determine differences in biomechanical workload across computer input 
tasks, a series of laboratory experiment was completed with 12 male graduate students. Each 
participant completed 8 target acquisition tasks by mouse and 9 typing/clicking tasks. Surface 
electromyography (EMG) measured muscle activity of four forearm muscles and two force 
sensing resistors, one on space key and one on left mouse button, measured applied forces by 
the index finger. The test results of target acquisition task show increasing moving distance of 
mouse cursor and number of clicks only increases the total duration of a participant to 
complete the task with self-selected speed. Participants maintain constant EMG intensity in 
their forearm while controlling the mouse. The typing or clicking rates significantly affect the 
muscle loads. However, the conclusions of workload drew from EMG and finger force in 
typing and clicking tasks was contradicted. Future experimental studies on fatigue and 
subjective evaluation are needed to account for such discrepancy.

指（5 指）操作鍵盤之差異。先進行滑鼠操作測試後再進行鍵盤操作測試，滑鼠與鍵盤
實驗間隔 5 分鐘休息時間，實驗設置與「實驗一」相同。滑鼠操作與鍵盤操作實驗分別
要求受測者跟隨電子節拍器之節奏（60、120、180 鍵/分），按壓滑鼠左鍵或敲擊鍵盤特
定按；當以 5 指操作鍵盤時，受測者可自選右手指分別按壓的按鍵，惟食指必須按壓空
白鍵上黏貼 FSR 之位置。每項實驗組合持續 2 分鐘，共計有九種實驗組合（3 種操作模
式×3 種速率）。實驗組合採隨機指派，每種速率測試之間給予 2 分鐘休息時間。 
 
2.3 資料分析 
各項實驗所得之訊號經過轉檔後，使用 Viewlog 程式進行資料處理[15]，分別計算
測試過程中各肌群 EMG 訊號絕對值及食指按壓力之均方根（Root Mean Square, RMS）
值；實驗一所測量之結果則額外計算各肌群絕對 EMG 訊號之總積分值（里曼和）。

B. 實驗二 
實驗結果顯示不同肌群對不同作業方式的反應不同，但大致上多指操作鍵盤時所測
得之 RMS EMG≥單指操作鍵盤≥單指按壓滑鼠按鍵。除了屈指淺肌（FDS）之 RMS EMG
未明顯受到操作頻率及模式的影響之外，其它肌群之 RMS EMG 皆隨操作頻率增加而增
大（p<0.001–0.016，表 5）。事後檢定 RMS EMG 呈現明顯差異的作業，皆符合多指操
作鍵盤≥單指操作鍵盤≥單指按壓滑鼠按鍵的情形。 
 40
儘管 ECR、ECU、FDS 這三條肌群在操作鍵盤時之平均負荷沒有大於操作鍵盤之
負荷，但本研究過程中，有部份受測者表示鍵盤操作測試會比滑鼠操作測試來得疲勞，
此結果暗示透過主觀感覺評估的結果，極可能會受到各項實驗 EMG 總和的影響。 
 
操作鍵盤時四條前臂肌群間的平均 EMG 的落差比滑鼠操作時大，顯示其肌肉的負
荷較不平均。也由於滑鼠及鍵盤之操作呈現不同的肌肉使用（負荷）方式，其獲得之結
果也無法由按鍵力量上獲得映証，因此目前的研究結果，尚未能應用 EMG 測量之結果
來進行滑鼠及鍵盤操作負荷之比較。 
 
本研究之後續工作必須增加不同的實驗設計，配合疲勞測試以及主觀感覺評估，建
立適當的心理物理轉換關係，以探討不同肌群施力比例之差異，以及影響其疲勞之主要
因子，以進一步探討滑鼠及鍵盤操作負荷間合理之量化比較方式。
