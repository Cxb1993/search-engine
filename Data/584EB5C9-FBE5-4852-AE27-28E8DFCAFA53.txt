Abstract 
 
In this project, we analyze the 
symbol-error-rate (SER) performance of 
decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative 
communications over Nakagami-m fading 
channels. For the classical three-node 
cooperation model, the exact SER expressions 
for both M-phase shift keying (PSK) and 
M-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) 
are derived. For easy usage, we provide 
asymptotic approximations for the SER as 
well. In the analysis, we consider the 
cooperation scenario in which all channels are 
uncorrelated. By varying the parameters of 
Nakagami-m fading channels in the analytical 
results, we obtain some perceptions of 
choosing a good relay for enhancing the 
cooperation and make clear about how the 
included Nakagami fading figures and channel 
variances affect the SER performance. In 
addition, optimal power allocation is 
investigated based on the derived asymptotic 
SER expressions. Simulations are finally 
provided to verify the correctness of our 
analysis.

二、前言與研究目的 
 
Transmission over wireless channels suffers 
from random fluctuations in signal level 
known as multipath fading, which can 
seriously degrade the detection performance 
[1]. In recent years, there has been great 
research interest in multiple-input 
multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which take 
advantage of the fact that multiple antennas 
establish many channels between the 
transmitter and receiver. The diversity gain 
inherent in MIMO systems, known as spatial 
diversity, can be used to reduce the 
performance degradation caused by multipath 
fading [2]-[4]. While MIMO systems offer 
 3
Note that only partial CSI is required for the 
determination of how much power should be 
allocated to the source and relay to optimize 
the SER performance. Simulations are finally 
provided to verify the correctness of our 
analysis.

Fig. 1. Three-node cooperation model for uplink communications 
 
Fig. 1 shows the cooperation model with 
single relay. The figure presents a typical 
usage of cooperative communications for the 
uplink of cellular wireless systems. This 
makes the handset equipped with single 
antenna achieve the transmit spatial diversity 
for link-quality improvement. The DF 
cooperation protocol considered here is 
realized over two consecutive time slots. 
During the first time slot, the source “S” 
broadcasts the transmitted symbol to both the 
relay “R” and the destination “D”. The relay 
then decodes the received signal and checks if 
it is correct, which can possibly be done 
through examining the included cyclic 
redundancy check (CRC) digits or 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. If the 
symbol is correctly decoded, the relay will 
forward it to the destination during the second 
time slot; otherwise, the relay will remain 
silent. Finally, the destination combines the 
received signals from the two consecutive 
time slots and determines which symbol is 
transmitted by the source. 
 
(B) SER Analysis Over Nakagami-m Fading 
Channels 
 
For example, we let msd, msr, mrd, Ωsd, Ωsr, and 
Ωrd denote the corresponding Nakagami 
fading figures and channel variances for hsd, 
hsr, and hrd, respectively. We can obtain the 
exact SER with M-PSK signals for the DF 
cooperation as

(C) Relay Selection 
 
From the analytical results, we also investigate 
the relay selection problem. Some guidelines 
found in this work for choosing a good relay 
that improves the cooperation performance 
can be summarized as follows. 
1) The relay owning large values of msr, Ωsr, 
mrd and Ωrd should be chosen. 
2) Large values of msr and mrd are generally 
more important than large values of Ωsr and 
Ωrd for the SER reduction. 
3) Large values of mrd and Ωrd are more 
important than large values of msr and Ωsr for 
the SER reduction. 
 
(D) Optimal Power Allocation 
 
For the considered DF protocol, if no CSI is 
available at the transmitting sides, the source 
and relay will use the same amount of power 
for transmission. This approach is surely not 
optimal, especially when the channel 
conditions are highly unbalanced. In this work, 
we also discuss the power allocation problem 
for the cooperation over Nakagami-m fading

LEE AND TSAI: PERFORMANCE OF DF COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATIONS OVER NAKAGAMI-m FADING CHANNELS 1219
based on minimizing the outage probability, in which the true
error rate might not necessarily be minimized.
In this paper, we analyze the SER performance of DF co-
operative communications over Nakagami-m fading channels.
We focus on the classical three-node cooperation model, which
includes a source, a relay, and a destination. The exact SER
expressions for both M -PSK and M quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) are derived. For easy usage, we also provide
asymptotic approximations for the SER. In the analysis, we first
consider the cooperation scenario in which all the channels are
uncorrelated. In practice, it may happen that a correlation exists
between the source–destination and relay–destination channels,
e.g., for user cooperation in the uplink of a cellular network. To
understand how this kind of correlation affects the cooperation,
we then examine the SER in this scenario. Moreover, through
varying the parameters of Nakagami-m fading channels in
the analytical results, we obtain some perceptions of choosing
a good relay for enhancing the cooperation and make clear
about how the included Nakagami fading figures and channel
variances affect the SER performance. More specifically, based
on the knowledge of partial channel state information (CSI),
we demonstrate that the system should choose a relay that owns
large values of the Nakagami fading figures and channel vari-
ances for both the source–relay and relay–destination channels,
in which the values for the relay–destination channel are more
important than the values for the source–relay channel, to ob-
tain a smaller SER. In addition, the optimal power allocation is
investigated based on the derived asymptotic SER expressions.
Note that only a partial CSI is required for the determination
of how much power should be allocated to the source and
relay to optimize the SER performance. Simulations are finally
provided to verify the correctness of our analysis.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the three-
node cooperation model for the analysis and simulations is
developed. The channel environment, the role of the relay, and
the corresponding operations are then explained in detail. In
Section III, we analyze the SER performance over uncorrelated
Nakagami-m fading channels. In Section IV, we examine the
scenario in which a correlation exists between the source–
destination and relay–destination channels. Section V presents
some guidelines for relay selection based on the analysis.
Next, in Section VI, the optimal power-allocation schemes over
both uncorrelated and correlated fading channels are obtained.
Finally, the performance evaluations and conclusions are given
in Sections VII and VIII, respectively.
II. THREE-NODE COOPERATION MODEL
Fig. 1 shows the cooperation model with a single relay. The
figure presents a typical usage of cooperative communications
for the uplink of cellular wireless systems. This makes the
handset equipped with a single antenna achieve the transmit
spatial diversity for link-quality improvement. The DF cooper-
ation protocol considered here is realized over two consecutive
time slots. During the first time slot, the source “S” broadcasts
the transmitted symbol to both the relay “R” and the destination
“D.” The relay then decodes the received signal and checks if
it is correct, which can possibly be done by examining the in-
Fig. 1. Three-node cooperation model for uplink communications.
cluded cyclic redundancy check (CRC) digits or signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) levels. If the symbol is correctly decoded, the relay
will forward it to the destination during the second time slot;
otherwise, the relay will remain silent. Finally, the destination
combines the received signals from the two consecutive time
slots and determines which symbol is transmitted by the source.
Let x denote the transmitted symbol with E{|x|2} = 1,
where E{·} represents the statistical expectation operation.
During the first time slot, the received signals at the destination
and relay can be written, respectively, as
ysd =
√
P1hsdx + nsd (1)
ysr =
√
P1hsrx + nsr (2)
where hsd and hsr are the channel coefficients for the
source–destination and source–relay channels, nsd and nsr are
the corresponding Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance
N0, and P1 is the source transmit power. Then, the relay
decodes its received signal and uses the power P˜2 for relaying.
If the symbol is correctly decoded, P˜2 = P2; otherwise, P˜2 =
0. Let the received signal at the destination from the second
time slot be denoted by yrd, i.e.,
yrd =
√
P˜2hrdx + nrd. (3)
Similarly, hrd is the channel coefficient for the relay–
destination channel, and nrd is the corresponding Gaussian
noise. Herein, we assume that the relay and the destination
have the necessary CSI for decoding, and there is a total power
constraint P1 + P2 = P (with 0 < P1 < P ) in the cooperation
network.
For the DF cooperation, we suppose that maximal ratio
combining (MRC) is used at the destination for combining the
received signals from the first and second time slots. The com-
bined signal can be expressed as y = w1ysd + w2yrd, where
w1 =
√
P1h
∗
sd/N0 and w2 =
√
P˜2h
∗
rd/N0 are the MRC coef-
ficients for ysd and yrd, respectively. Note that the superscript
(·)∗ in the foregoing expressions denotes the complex conjugate
operation. The output SNR at the destination can then be shown
to be γMRC = (P1|hsd|2 + P˜2|hrd|2)/N0.
In the following sections, we will analyze the performance
of the DF cooperation over Nakagami-m fading channels, i.e.,
hsd, hsr, and hrd are all described by a Nakagami-m distribu-
tion [21]. The probability density function (pdf) of a Nakagami
random variable H is given by

B. Asymptotic Approximations for SER
Observe that the previously found SER expressions involve
very complex integrals that are difficult to evaluate. Next, we
derive approximations for the SER in (8) and (11) with asymp-
totically large SNR values. The derivations of relay selection
guidelines and optimal power allocation schemes in the follow-
ing sections are mainly based on these SER approximations.
In the cooperation network, when the SNR values for the
three channels are sufficiently large or, equivalently, P1Ωsd 
N0, P1Ωsr  N0, and P2Ωrd  N0, we can write

where g = gPSK for M -PSK signals, and g = gQAM for
M -QAM signals. Under this premise and the assumption that
Ωsd 	= 0, Ωsr 	= 0, and Ωrd 	= 0, (8) can be approximated as

correlated hsd and hrd can be approximated without evaluating
the cumbersome integrals in (23) and (24).
V. RELAY SELECTION
In the previous sections, we obtained the asymptotic SER
approximations in different DF cooperation scenarios, which
include those for M -PSK/M -QAM signals over uncorrelated/
correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. Here, by inspecting
the approximated expressions and their relation with the chan-
nel parameters, we can gain some insight into the problem of
choosing a good relay to enhance the cooperation performance.
Note that the derived selection guidelines are only based on
partial CSI, i.e., the Nakagami fading figures and the channel
variances.
The discussion given below is based on the approximated
SER given in (17) but can be extended to other results as
well. To have much understanding about how different channel
parameters affect the performance, we rewrite (17) as
Pe,PSK  Bsd(BsrAsdAsr + BrdAsd−rd) (31)
where Bsd = ((N0msd/P1ΩsdgPSK))msd , Bsr = ((N0msr/
P1ΩsrgPSK))msr , and Brd = ((N0mrd/P2ΩrdgPSK))mrd . Un-
der the high SNR assumption, (N0msd/P1ΩsdgPSK) < 1 is
ordinarily observed in Bsd. In this case, to obtain a smaller
value for Bsd and then a smaller value for (31), both Ωsd
and msd should be large. This observation is intuitively true
according to the communication theory. However, the channel
conditions between the source and the destination are usually
not adjustable, and therefore, we do not have much control over
the value of Bsd in general.
Basically, one way to further improve the DF cooperation
performance is through choosing a better relay. The focus here
is to investigate what channel conditions for the relay can make
Bsr, Brd, and then (31) more remarkably smaller. Likewise,
with (N0msr/P1ΩsrgPSK)<1, and (N0mrd/P2ΩrdgPSK)<1
(under the high SNR assumption as well), the larger msr and
Ωsr are, the smaller Bsr becomes, and the larger mrd and Ωrd
are, the smaller Brd becomes. Combining these two results,
we first conclude that we should choose the relay with msr,
Ωsr, mrd, and Ωrd as large as possible to reduce the SER.
Furthermore, since msr and mrd exist in the exponents of Bsr
and Brd, respectively, choosing a relay with a large msr and
mrd is generally more effective than choosing a relay with
a large Ωsr and Ωrd to improve SER performance. However,
since the Nakagami fading figures and the channel variances
are in different scale ranges, we will empirically show the actual
outcome of this saying in Section VII.
Next, we examine the effect of AsdAsr and Asd−rd on the
SER in (31). Since their values depend on M , msd, msr, and
mrd, the general relation between AsdAsr and Asd−rd is not
easy to be interpreted. Instead, we plot their values for M = 4
and some specific msd versus different msr and mrd in Fig. 2.
In the figure, we can see that Asd−rd will always be larger
than AsdAsr, provided that similar values of msr and mrd are
acquired. Therefore, together with Bsr and Brd, a relay with
a large Ωrd can reduce the SER more remarkably than a relay
with a large Ωsr. In addition, as previously described, for msr
and mrd existing in the exponents, if mrd is larger than msr,

A. SER Over Uncorrelated Fading Channels
In this part, we first check the cooperation performance
over uncorrelated Nakagami-m fading channels. Figs. 3 and
4 present the SER with 4-PSK and 16-QAM signals versus
different SNRs, respectively. In these two figures, we set
msd = msr = mrd = m, and Ωsd = Ωsr = Ωrd = 1. In addi-
tion, shown is the SER of no cooperation, which is labeled
“Direct.” We observe that the SER curves that are marked
“Exact SER” almost perfectly match those in the simulations.
In addition, the SER curves marked “Tight approximation” are
asymptotically tight to those in the simulations in the high SNR
region. These show the correctness of our analytical results
given in Section III. These figures also demonstrate that from
the medium-to-high SNR region, the DF cooperation can al-
ways substantially improve the SER performance, as compared
with no cooperation.
Next, we simulate the cooperation scenarios in which the
relay may own different values of Ωsr, Ωrd and msr, mrd,
Fig. 5. SER performance over uncorrelated Nakagami-m fading channels
(msd = 1, Ωsd = 1, and msr = mrd = m with different Ωsr and Ωrd) for
4-PSK signals.

respectively. On one hand, in Fig. 5, we set msd = 1, Ωsd = 1,
and msr = mrd = m for 4-PSK signals. With different Ωsr and
Ωrd, we can see that for the SER reduction, increasing m is
generally more important than increasing either Ωsr or Ωrd.
In addition, the relay with Ωsr = 1 and Ωrd = 10 produces a
smaller SER for the cooperation network than the relay with
Ωsr = 10 and Ωrd = 1, which means that a large Ωrd is more
important than a large Ωsr to improve performance. These
results are consistent with the provided guidelines for relay
selection. On the other hand, Fig. 6 shows the cooperation
performance in which msd = 1, Ωsd = Ωsr = Ωrd = 1, and
4-PSK signals are used. By varying msr and mrd, we see the
same trend, i.e., increasing either msr or mrd can always im-
prove performance. Moreover, the figure shows that increasing
mrd is more effective than increasing msr for SER reduction.
These are pointed out in the guidelines for relay selection
as well.

TABLE II
OPTIMAL POWER ALLOCATION WITH DIFFERENT
msd = msr = mrd = m AND Ωrd FOR Ωsd = Ωsr = 1
in Tables I and II. From Table I, we can see that as the difference
between msr and mrd becomes large, the difference between
P1/P and P2/P goes large in most cases. That is to say, more
power will be assigned to the source. The SER reduction with
the optimal power allocation is then more notable in these
scenarios. From Table II, we can see that when Ωsr and Ωrd are
highly unbalanced (with large Ωrd in this case), the difference
between P1/P and P2/P also becomes significant. All these
indicate that the optimal power allocation is more suitable to be
utilized in the cooperation network owning highly unbalanced
values of the Nakagami fading figures and variances for the
channels.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Cooperative communications have recently been proposed
to enhance the link quality for wireless communications. A
spatial diversity can be achieved through the help of other
users/communication terminals acting as relays. In this paper,
we have considered the DF cooperation protocol with a single
relay over Nakagami-m fading channels. The SER performance
for different DF cooperation circumstances was fully analyzed.
Some guidelines for relay selection and optimal power allo-
cation based on partial CSI were obtained in the analysis.
Specifically, we found that the system should choose a relay that
owns large values of the Nakagami fading figures and channel
variances for both the source–relay and relay–destination chan-
nels, in which the values for the relay–destination channel are
more important than the values for the source–relay channel,
to obtain a smaller SER. It has also been shown that the
optimal power allocation is fairly important for reducing the
SER when the Nakagami fading figures and variances for
the channels are highly unbalanced. All of these provide the
basics for the discussion of the DF cooperation performance
and much understanding about how to more effectively apply
this kind of diversity in realistic scenarios.

一、主要任務摘要 
    這次出國目的是參加2009年在日本京都舉行之國際消費性電子產品研討會(IEEE 
International Symposium on Consumer Electronics ;ISCE)，此次會議為IEEE Consumer 
Electronic Society 之年度大會，去年在葡萄牙舉行，明年將在德國舉行，因此能參加難
得在亞洲舉辦的會議，甚具意義。ISCE會議從1997年開始成立，到今年為第十三屆。
由於本次會議所涵蓋消費性電子產品之範圍相當廣，安排了相當多精采之演講，各領
域專家學者都盡力將其研究之精華，於會中和大家分享。是次會議主題包括home 
entertainment, mobile computing & communications, AV technology, RF & wireless, 
consumer networks, automotive entertainment & information, user interface & human 
interaction, security & right management, and enabling technology. 
 
二、對計劃之效益 
    藉由參與IEEE ISCE 2009了解目前先進國家於相關領域之研究和發展目標，期望為
本計劃定出更具有前瞻性的方向。 
 
三、經過 
     我個人參予的海報議程(Poster Session)安排在會議的第三天下午(5/27)，由於是次
的海報議程時段，並沒有安排任何的口頭報告議程(Oral Session)，因此出席者眾多，場
面比我想像中熱鬧。海報議程結束後，大會安排 Mr. Nobuyuki Idei 的 Keynote 演說，
結束後到隔壁的 Hotel Granvia Kyoto 舉行晚宴，頒發是次會議的三篇 Best Paper 
Awards，及移交舉辦權給德國的代表。這時才發現，該德國學者下午也參加了海報議
程，我和他交流了許多 IEEE802.21 及 Mobile IP 對異質網路整合下的心得。 
 
四、心得 
這次會議舉辦地點在日本京都，距離台灣只需要兩個多小時的航程，因此機票的成本
負擔較低，加上只有輕微一個小時的時差，讓我在沒有時差困擾下，能在最佳狀態下
出席是次會席。由於地理關係，是次會議台灣之論文佔21.6%，相較於去年在葡萄牙舉
行的ISCE2008台灣論文只佔7%，大幅提高了近三倍，由此可見，台灣的論文產量甚高，
只是礙於經費有限，大都只能參加亞洲舉辦的大型國際會議。 
這次出國經驗最可惜是剛好遇上H1N１流感，因此必須非常小心，且要經常戴口罩及
清潔雙手。在會議中，由於我是第一次參加海報議程，感覺很特別，相對口頭報告，
海報議程拉近了作者和聽眾的距離，互動性也較高。比較可惜的是，由於是次會議舉
行期間前一週，遇上關西地區的H1N1流感事件，因此有些作者並沒有出席是次會議，
錯過了他們的精彩報告與交流。故此，只能針對出席者盡量發問。在這次會議藉由別
人的報告以及大家共同討論的問題當中，不僅讓我充分了解到自己研究的改進方向及
空間、也同時讓我對這方面的領域有更進一步的理解。本次會議所涵蓋的議題主要圍
繞在消費性電子產品上之多媒體技術，當中也包括如何應用在無線網路及行動計算環
境中。我個人除了參加我本身所報告的子會議外，也同時參加了幾個我比較感興趣的
sessions。參與這些sessions，一方面中瞭解其他論文的內容，也一方面思考我們做研究
的方向，收穫頗多。
