1. Introduction 
Under the advancement of computer and Internet technologies, the transmission, 
circulation, and transaction of digital information and digital works (e.g. text, image, 
sound, video) become more convenient and frequent. However, digitized information or 
work is likely to be tampered with and altered, if the information receiver cannot 
authenticate the information, there may be unwanted hazards and disputes [1]. For 
example, if a medical image is tampered with, there may be an insurance settlement 
dispute or doctor's misdiagnosis; if a news picture is tampered with or destroyed, facts 
may be distorted, infringing press ethics or even violating others' rights and interests 
illegally; if an evidential image for criminal case is tampered with or destroyed, there 
may be misjudgements, thus, violating two parties' lawful rights and interests; if a 
personal private image is tampered with or destroyed, personal reputations may be 
damaged [2]. Therefore, how to verify the integrity of digital images has become a 
popular and important research subject.  
Image integrity verification can be implemented by digital signature [3] and digital 
watermarking. The basic spirit of image integrity verification implemented by digital 
signature is to extract the image feature information of digital images, and to save the 
image feature information independently as authentication information. Whether a 
digital image is tampered with can be verified provided the authentication information 
determined. However, this method only determines whether the image is tampered or 
not, which part is tampered with cannot be known. Differing from digital 
signature-based image authentication, digital watermarking not only can identify 
whether an image has been tampered with, but can also locate the tampered part, thus, 
the practicability of digital watermarking in image authentication is greatly enhanced.  
Digital watermarks can be classified into robust watermarks, fragile watermarks, 
and semi-fragile watermarks, according to the strength to resist attacks. A robust 
watermark is unlikely to be destroyed, thus, it is usually applied to image copyright 
protection [4-10]. A fragile watermark is less resistant to attacks, is unlikely to survive 
as the image is destroyed, and is usually used in image tamper detection [2, 11-19]. The 
robustness of a semi-fragile watermark falls between robust and fragile watermarks, it is 
more resistant to unmalicious attacks (e.g. JPEG lossy compression), but it is more 
sensitive to malicious tampering attacks [1, 20, 21]. At present, most image tampering 
detection methods use fragile or semi-fragile watermarking. 
A fragile watermark converts image feature values into watermarks, which is hiden

tamper authentication, and recovery effects.  
2. Literature Review 
The integrity of a digital image is verified by fragile watermarking, the information 
for verification, such as a digital watermark or an encrypted media characteristic value, 
is embedded in the digital image to be protected. The content of the watermark 
embedded by such a technology will be changed as the image is modified slightly. Due 
to such a high sensibility to image attacks, fragile watermarking is very applicable to the 
verification of image integrity. Fragile digital watermarking should meet the following 
requirements [11]:  
(1) Tamper detection: malicious attacks must be detected, such as modifications, 
clippings of images, or changing the specific region of an image.  
(2) Imperceptibility: the damage of the embedded watermark on the digital image is 
unlikely to be perceived.  
(3) Tamper location: the watermark can accurately locate a maliciously tampered part.  
(4) Tamper recovery: the maliciously tampered region can be recovered, thus, the user 
can know the original content.  
Due to the requirements for the practicability of image authentication, in recent 
years, many image authentication methods have been successively proposed. Lin et al. 
[12] proposed a hierarchical image tamper detection and recovery scheme. Only two 
bits are used for tamper detection at the first stage, thus, there is a very high false 
negative error rate at this stage. Although authentication at the second stage and the 
third stage can reduce the false negative error rate of the first stage, it will increase the 
false positive error rate. At the recovery stage, if the block embedded with recovery 
information is marked as untampered, the recovery information is directly extracted for 
recovery; on the contrary, the average gray level of peripheral blocks is used for 
recovery. Lee & Lin [16] proposed a double watermark-based image tamper detection 
and recovery scheme. Since their scheme only used three LSBs of each pixel for 
authentication in tamper detection, those tampering attacks that did not change the three 
LSBs were impossible to detect. For example, a region of an image is copied to other 
positions of the image, or the first five MSBs (Most Significant Bits) of the image are 
replaced by the first five MSBs of another image to make the image look like another 
image, such tampering attacks would not be detected. Zhang and Wang [19] proposed 
fragile watermarking that combines block authentication with pixel authentication, 
which method can identify whether an 8 × 8 block is tampered with or not, and can 
5 
 
information in the unsmooth region has a double backup. If a large block is an 
unsmooth block, all the small blocks within it are unsmooth small blocks; on the 
contrary, if a large block is a smooth block, all the small blocks in it are smooth small 
blocks. Figure 1 shows that the 1/3 blocks with the maximum gray level variance in the 
original image is marked in white, while the other blocks are marked in black. Therefore, 
the white region represents an unsmooth region in the image. The image tamper 
detection and recovery scheme proposed in this study is detailed, as follows.  
3.1 Watermark embedding method  
The watermark embedding rule is as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 (a) shows the 
watermark content in an unsmooth small block, and Figure 2 (b) shows the watermark 
content in a smooth small block, where p0, p1, p2, and p3 denote four gray levels of a 
small block, (b7, b6, …, b0) is eight bits of a gray level, Hs is the authentication 
information of small block, Hb is the authentication information of large block, Rs is the 
recovery information of small block, Rb is the recovery information of large block, and 
C is the type of large block (C = 0 represents smooth block, and C = 1 represents 
unsmooth block). The watermark embedding procedure is described below.  
Step 1: Divide the full image into k = M × N / 64 nonoverlapping large blocks, and 
number these large blocks in turn; then, divide the full image into M × N / 4 
nonoverlapping small blocks, and number these small blocks in turn.  
Step 2: Divide the full image into 16 nonoverlapping zones Z0, Z1, …, Z15, where each 
zone contains k small blocks. Let

where ai, j is the number of the j-th small block in the i-th zone Zi. The k small blocks in 
the zone Zi are numbered as (ai,0, ai,1, …, ai,k−1). Then, use a virtual random number 
generator with seed SK to disarrange the elements in each row vector of matrix A and 
generate a stochastic correspondence matrix

embedding (Figure 2 (a)).  
Step 8: For each large block, use the MD5 function to convert the large block content 
(bits other than Hs and Hb), large block number and key SK into 128-bit information, 
and use XOR folding method to fold the 128-bit to 16-bit large block authentication 
information, and embed the large block authentication information in the 16 Hb bits of 
this large block according to the embedding rules in Figure 2.  
3.2 Image authentication  
At first, we define the symbols related to image authentication and recovery, and 
implement image tamper detection according to the following procedure.  
Eb: Means large block is tampered.  
Es: Means small block is tampered.  
Uc: Means the large block type cannot be determined.  
Us: Means the small block recovery information cannot be obtained.  
Step 1: For each large block Bj (for j = 0, 1, …, k − 1), generate large block 
authentication information and compare it with the pre-embedded large block 
authentication information, if the results are inconsistent, this large block is marked as 
Eb.  
Step 2: For each large block Bj (for j = 0, 1, …, k − 1), if the large block of any small 
block of a′0,j, a′1,j, …, a′15,j is not marked as Eb, the C bit of this small block is used to 
identify the block type of Bj; on the contrary, Bj is marked as Uc.  
Step 3: For each large block marked as Eb, each small block within it is authenticated; 
in other words, five authentication bits of the small block are generated according to the 
watermark embedding procedure. If it is a smooth block, the first four bits are used for 
authentication, if it is an unsmooth block, then all five bits are used for authentication. If 
the type of this large block cannot be identified, each small block is authenticated using 
the first four authentication bits. If the generated authentication code is inconsistent with 
the hidden authentication code, the small block is marked as Es.  
Step 4: For each large block Bj marked as Uc, if there are small blocks of a′0,j, a′1,j, …, 
a′15,j not marked as Es, the C bit of these small blocks is taken out, and the block type of 
Bj is determined by the mode of these C bits, and the Uc mark of Bj is removed.  
Step 5: For each column vector (a′0,j, a′1,j, …, a′15,j)T (for j = 0, 1, …, k − 1) in A′, if 
there are small blocks not marked as Es, the mode of the C bits of these small blocks is

an image with a watermark (Figure 3 (a)) under cropping attack in ratio of 0.5 (Figure 3 
(b)) is recovered (Figure 3 (c)), it is observed in the recovered image (Figure 3 (c)) that 
there is obvious mosaic in the smooth zone. However, better recovery quality can be 
obtained using the proposed method to eliminate mosaic (Figure 3 (d)).  
4. Experiments and Discussions 
4.1 Experimental Results 
Let FN represent the number of False Negative pixels, i.e. the number of pixels that 
are tampered with in fact, but are identified as untampered; FP represents the number of 
False Positive pixels, i.e. the number of pixels that are untampered in fact, but identified 
as tampered with; TN is the number of True Negative pixels, i.e. the number of pixels 
that are untampered with in fact and identified as untampered as well; TP is the number 
of True Positive pixels, i.e. the number of pixels that are tampered in fact and identified 
as tampered as well. This study uses the following Tamper Ratio (ρ), False Negative 
Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) indices to evaluate the error rate of tamper 
detection [2, 27].  
 ρ = (FN + TP) / (M × N).  (8) 
 FNR = FN / (FN + TP).  (9) 
 FPR = FP / (FP + TN).  (10)

xi,j is the pixel gray level of image X, and yi,j is the pixel gray level of image Y. In the 
following experiment, PSNR(w) denotes the PSNR between the untampered image with a 
watermark and the original image, and PSNR(r) denotes the PSNR between the 
11 
 
variation and low variation images. ANOVA test results showed that the content 
structure of an image affects the tamper recovery quality. The proposed scheme has 
better image recovery quality of low variation images (see Table 2).  
4.2 Analysis and Discussion 
In the proposed scheme, 1/3 of the pixels use two LSBs to embed watermarks, 
while 2/3 of the pixels use three LSBs to embed watermarks. Therefore, each pixel uses 
2.67 bits to embed watermarks on average, and each pixel has 1.33-bit content on 
average changed by the embedded watermarks. However, in the scheme of Lee and Lin 
[16], each pixel uses 3 LSBs to embed watermarks, thus, each pixel has 1.5-bit content 
on average changed by the embedded watermark. Therefore, in comparison to the 
watermark embedding scheme of Lee and Lin [16], the proposed scheme has less 
damage to the original image. In terms of authentication error rate, the block 
authentication error rate is related to the bits of authentication information in this study. 
If the authentication information contains m bits, the false negative error rate of block 
authentication is 2−m; thus, the false negative error rate of a large block is 2−16, the false 
negative error rate of an unsmooth small block is 2−5, and the false negative error rate of 
a smooth small block is 2−4. In addition, the proposed image authentication scheme not 
only combines the authentication of large blocks with that of small blocks, but also uses 
block type information to correct small block authentication results; therefore, the small 
block false negative error rate is lower than the theoretical value 2−m. In Step 2 of 
watermark embedding, the image is divided into 16 nonoverlapping zones, thus, 
uniformly spreading the block type information of each large block over the 16 zones. If 
one block type bit survives, the type of large block can be correctly identified. On 
average, as the tamper ratio is not more than 15/16, the block type information has a 
very high probability of survival; in this case, we can authenticate unsmooth small 
blocks more accurately, and make more accurate tamper recovery. Another purpose of 
dividing the image into 16 nonoverlapping zones is to uniformly spread the 16-bit 
recovery information of large block over the 16 zones in order to increase the survival 
rate. Finally, ANOVA test results showed that, the content structure of an image can 
influence the quality of tamper recovery and the proposed scheme can result in better 
image recovery quality of low variation images.  
5. Conclusions 
This study uses smoothness to distinguish the types of image blocks, with different 
block types given different watermark embedding, tamper detection, and recovery 
strategies. Therefore, image authentication information and recovery information can be

二、 與會心得 
此次會議的 Scholarship Committee Chair 為中國的南昌大學教授Min Zhu，而 Program 
Committee Chairs 則為中國的華中師範大學教授 Dehuai Yang 與馬來西亞的 University of 
Malaya 教授 Wei Lee，所以此會議可說是由中國學者所主導的一個國際學術研討會。此次
會議較令人遺憾的是與本人所發表的主題相關的文章很少，儘管如此，在此次會議中還是
有令人感興趣的相關主題，例如由Wang等學者所發表的文章Remote Environmental Sensing 
System Based on the Surface Plasmon Resonance Technology and Total-Internal Reflection 
Theory in Heterodyne Interferometry，這個主題與我多年前於澳洲昆士蘭大學所參與的國際
學術研討會所聆聽的其中一場主題相關，因此印象特別深刻。此外，此次會議另一個讓人
遺憾的是舉辦單位準備的研討會論文集紙本與光碟份數不足，導致部分學者沒有辦法在現
場拿到相關資料，而是於會後透過 email 的方式再向主辦單位索取。這種疏失雖令人印象
不佳，但我認為可做為想要舉辦國際學術研討會的人的一個借鏡，應記取教訓勿重蹈覆轍
才是。這次會議舉行的地點在馬來西亞的首都吉隆坡，該城市的風土民情融合了多元種族

importance of peripheral image information. In addition, many methods regard verification 
information of falsification detection and image restoration information as different watermarks, 
thus disregarding the probability of watermark having the above two functions at the same time. As 
a result, the cross-validation and mutual backup cannot be achieved. As the peripheral information 
of image is similar, this study attempted to use the correlation among blocks to develop an image 
verification and restoration method, so that the watermark can have image falsification detection 
and restoration functions at the same time, thus improving the accuracy of image verification and 
the quality of restoration.  
2. Method 
If the original image is an m × n undistorted gray image, m denotes the image length (line number), 
and n denotes the image width (column number). Let Q denote integer be greater than zero. Figure 
1 shows the watermark hiding rules, Pi denotes the i-th pixel in a small block, Bj denotes the j-th bit 
in a pixel value. The detailed procedures of watermark embedding, image verification and image 
restoration method are described below. 
2.1 Generation and embedding of watermark  
This study used peripheral image information and MD5 function to generate verification 
information and restoration information, and hide them in the original image.

Step 1: The image is first split into nonoverlapping 4×8 blocks; and then each large block is cut 
up into two nonoverlapping 4×4 medium blocks; finally, each medium block is cut up into four 
nonoverlapping 2×2 small blocks.  
Step 2: The small blocks are numbered, starting with 0 from the left to the right, and from the 
top to the bottom; and then the original image is cut up into four large regions, and the numbers of 
small blocks in each region are disorganized by pseudo-random sequence. The numbers of four 
large regions are displaced, and the medium block is a unit. The medium blocks in the same 
position of different regions are of one group. The four small block numbers in it are displaced to 
the other three large regions. The transposition of the same number and the displacement mode are 
shown in Figure 2. For example, the watermarks of small blocks in the upper left region are 
embedded in the other three regions separately. When the upper left image is destroyed, the 
watermark can be extracted from the other three regions for image restoration.  
Step 3: Calculate the average pixel value sg  of each 2×2 small block and the average pixel 
value mg  of the corresponding 4×4 medium block. Let g
〈k〉 denote the result of setting the first k 
LSBs of a nonnegative integer g as zero, the equation is as follows:

2.3 Image restoration  
This section introduces how to implement image restoration for a falsified image. If the watermark 
of mean value of small blocks cannot be extracted directly for restoration, the watermark 
information of other small blocks in the medium block can be used for restoration. Peripheral 3x3 
image mean value is used for restoration, and the four steps of image restoration are shown below.  
Step 1: For each small block marked as an error, if the corresponding small block is marked as 
correct, the (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) of the corresponding small block will be used for restoration.  
Step 2: For each un-restored small block marked as an error, if one of the corresponding small 
blocks of the other three small blocks in the block is marked as correct, the restoration information 
of (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) and (b1, b2, b3) will be taken out, and the following medium block mean value 
estimation equation is used to restore the small block:

Step 3: For each un-restored small block marked as error, if one of the other three small blocks 
in the medium block is marked as correct and (c1, c2) ⊗ (z1, z2) = (0, 0). The mean pixel value of the 
block is closest to the mean pixel value of medium block. The mean pixel value of this block is used 
to restore the error small block in the block.  
Step 4: For each un-restored error small block, the mean pixel value of correct blocks of 
peripheral 8 blocks is used for restoration.  
3. Experimental Results 
In order to verify the efficiency of this method, the following detection error rate evaluation indexes 
are defined first:  
 FNR = FN/(FN + TP),                    (10) 
 FPR = FP/(FP + TN),                   (11) 
where FN, FP, TN, and TP denote the number of False Negative, False Positive, True Negative, and 
True Positive pixels. The following indicators are used to evaluate the quality of image restoration:

The experiment set parameter Q = 2. In order to verify the efficiency of this method, the 
following multiple attack experiments were conducted and compared with the method proposed by 
Lee and Lin [5]. Figure 3 shows 75% cropping attack experiment. Figures 3(a) - 3(g) show seven 
different 75% cropping attacks, Figures 3(h) - 3(n) show the detection results, and Figures 3(o) - 
3(u) show the restoration results. The experimental data of Figure 3 are shown in Table 1. The 
results of the collage attack experiment are shown in Figure 4. Some important regions of image are 
reproduced and moved to other regions. Figures 4(a) - 4(c) show different collage attack 
experiments. Figures 4(d) - 4(f) show the detection results of Lee and Lin, where the black spot 
represents the detected falsified region, and the white spot represents the detected unfalsified 
region. Figures 4(g) - 4(i) show the restoration results of Lee and Lin. Figures 4(j) - 4(l) show the 
detection results of this method, and Figures 4(m) - 4(o) show the restoration results of this method. 
The experimental data of Figure 4 are shown in Table 2. The above experimental results suggest
