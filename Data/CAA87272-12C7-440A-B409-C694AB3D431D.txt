broader understanding of the entire transition 
process. A comprehensive analysis of effects of 
Reynolds number, the gap-ratio, and the angle of 
incidence on different flow-induced forces on the 
cylinders is included in this regard. On the other 
hand, our simulated wakes with various non-zero 
incidence-angles are found to reveal a rich variety 
of instability induced weakly synchronized physical 
evolution characteristics, which remained virtually 
unexplored.

relative-gap (G) between the cylinders, their aspect-ratio (A 1), and the angles of incidence ( ) play crucial roles in the 
physical transition process. The wake past the elliptic cylinders evolves through various forms of synchronization 
(in-phase/anti-phase), periodic/quasi-periodic deflection towards one of the cylinders, and stationary/random flip-flopping, 
depending on the gap-ratio (surface-to-surface distance divided by minor cylinder-width) and the Reynolds number. For weak 
coupling (with relatively large G; 1G 5) many of the past researchers report occurrences of both anti-phase and in-phase 
synchronized vortex shedding behind a pair of circular cylinders (A=1). Findings of Williamson16 confirm, the shedded vortices 
(for 40Re 160) remain synchronized either in phase or in anti-phase. The anti-phase streets often preserve the phase-locked 
identity of the vortices even at a far downstream location. However, for strong coupling (with relatively lower G) only in-phase 
vortex shedding has been reported, and the associated physical process eventually leads to formation of a complex 
asymmetrically evolving Benard von Karman street. Notably, such distinctive scenarios, their transition routes, and governing 
physics are subject to change for the asymmetric (A 1) bluff bodies, and at non-zero angles of incidences; particularly with the 
more streamlined low-gap-ratio elliptic cylinders. Furthermore, for 0.5<G<1.0 the unstable biased jet (through the gap) gets 
alternately deflected towards one of the cylinders and evolves predominantly asymmetrically following a pitchfork bifurcation; 
thereby producing one narrow and an wider wake behind the cylinders. The narrower wake is known to produce higher drag/lift 
forces, and it corresponds to higher vortex shedding frequency. In contrary, the wider wake remains associated with lower 
drag/lift force, and shedding frequency. Important to note here that, within a very narrow range of G, the transitional gap-flow 
first evolves as steady-deflected, and quickly becomes (unsteady) oscillatory, to eventually switch randomly between two 
well-defined asymmetric states, owing to growths of a stationary and an oscillatory unstable mode. The existence of deflected 
flow behind two side-by-side circular cylinders (A=1) has been confirmed by Kim and Durbin17, Sumner et al.18, Zhou et al.19, 
and Mizushima and Ino20. Moreover, a fairly consistent transition process from symmetric to deflected flows behind an array of 
square cylinders, as observed by Mizushima and Kawaguchi21, is verified to be induced by a pitchfork bifurcation. However, the 
physical details of the onset of transition with a pair of relatively streamlined elliptic cylinders (A 1) and associated wake 
evolution are expected to be significantly more complex, and remained largely unexplored. 
    On the other hand, transition from the oscillatory to the phase-locked flow behind a pair of side-by-side elliptic cylinders 
appears a rather tricky, physically sensitive issue, and the existing literature still lacks sufficient dependable/systematic 
investigations on the topic. It occurs via several critical bifurcations (which appear to depend very much on aspect-ratio A) and 
associated quasi-periodic perturbations of the wake within a very narrow range of G. However, exploration of such complex flow 
features, particularly behind a pair of inclined elliptic cylinders, remained virtually non-existent. To this point, using an 
embedding method conceptually similar to the present one, Ravoux et al.22 report formation of various shedding patterns in the 
wake of two side-by-side circular cylinders (A=1), which include quasi-periodic, asymmetric, and chaotic regimes. While the 
phase-portraits of their simulated lift/drag coefficients suggest the dynamics of force coefficients on the two cylinders should get 
progressively decoupled as flow regime changes from synchronous to near-chaotic state, the important issues like: (i) involved 
physics surrounding onsets of sequence of instability/transitions, (ii) the inherent aspect-ratio (A  1) dependency of the 
natures/routes of bifurcations, and, (iii) associated variations of the corresponding critical Reynolds numbers have never been 
examined/identified (which is rather a complex, lengthy task; and remained unknown). To this point, employing our recently 
developed nested Cartesian-grid methodology, in conjunction with an effective immersed boundary technique and a two-step 
fractional step procedure, our objective here is to extract in-depth critical details of transition of low Reynolds number flows past 
a pair of side-by-side elliptic cylinders, covering various aspect-ratios and incidence angles. 
II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Instability and bifurcations at zero incidence  
   We begin with the investigation of critical transition characteristics in the narrow gap range, and extract the underlying 
bifurcation patterns. For this, firstly, the flows past two side-by-side elliptic cylinders (of aspect-ratio A=2) in the gap-ratio range 
 4 
Explicit details of corresponding gradual transition characteristics are, however, documented sequentially in Tables 4-5.  
(ii) Semi-single deflected vortex shedding and bifurcation diagram at G=0.4 
Notably, with A=2, 0.2G  2.0 and 40Re 70, the jets issuing through the gap between two cylinders retained 
symmetry (Table 2). However, for each of G=0.4, G=0.6, G=1.4, and G=1.6, whether the jet passing between the pair of elliptic 
cylinders should be symmetric with respect to the central line or deflect, depended very much on Re. For each of such cases, the 
onset of instability remains primarily linked to a critical Re, and the mechanism appeared inherently dependent on G. Since the 
shedding patterns at G=0.4, and G=0.6 (and G=1.6) are inherently different, we term deflected vortices at G=0.4 as the deflected 
semi-single vortex street, and the deflected vortices at G=0.6 (or 1.6), as the deflected twin vortex street. As we will soon 
discover, the instability-induced periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic deflections of the oncoming gap-flow make the transition 
processes more and more complex.  
    Firstly, one of such deflected semi-single vortex shedding at Re=80, G=0.4 and A=2 is presented in Fig.6. The growth of the 
flow is depicted only within the partial range of x =[−5, 50] and y = [−9, 9], although the actual computational domain is larger in 
the vertical direction. Figure 6 captures growth of a biased jet (gap-flow) with upward/downwardly deflected core recirculation 
region formed immediately behind the cylinders. Since at G=0.4 the pair of cylinders acts more or less like a single obstacle, the 
upper and the lower ellipses (cylinders) bear virtually similar oscillation forces (induced by the vortex shedding). This can be 
readily realized from the instantaneous variations of lift-coefficients for the two cylinders, as presented in Figs. 6(b)-(d). Even 
though their magnitudes became slightly different, the lift-forces on the upper (CL,1) and the lower (CL,2) cylinders retained the 
same phase-angle. Furthermore, the computed stable upwardly-biased growth of the flow [Fig.6(a)] virtually suggests existence 
of another stable downwardly biased flow. By playing with the initial conditions, the presence of a downwardly-biased state is 
eventually ascertained, and illustrated in Fig. 6(e). 
To better understand the crucial physics leading to the phenomenon of growth of near-wake deflected recirculation region 
(for the upwardly biased flow), the time-averaged transverse velocity, cV , along the downstream central line is subsequently 
computed, and graphically presented in Fig. 7(a). It is noted that, the deflected recirculation arises primarily in the close 
neighborhood, and dominates mostly between x=0.5 and x=5.0. Moreover, the maximum biased vertical velocity occurs at around 
x=1.5. Consequently, x=1.5 is also chosen to be the position where we computed the time-mean vertical velocity, as extensively 
documented in Tables 2 and 3. The far-wake flow is thereafter seen [Fig.7(a)] to gradually return to symmetry. 
In order to reveal the exact transition route associated with this deflected semi-single vortex shedding, the near-critical flows 
past the elliptic cylinders at G=0.4 are repeatedly solved by increasing Re very slowly. The distinctive features of such flows in 
the form of time-averaged central-line velocity and lift-coefficient amplitude (for A=2) are collected and listed in Table 3. 
Moreover, a detailed transition diagram, in terms of the transverse velocity 1.5c,xV   at (x, y)=(1.5, 0), is presented in Fig. 7(b). 
Note that, at G=0.4 the sub-critical flows at very small Re (Re<22.1) are steady [Fig. 5(b)]. The steady flow gradually becomes 
unstable and transits to a symmetric semi-single vortex shedding flow, once Re is increased to be larger than 22.1 (i.e., Recr,v 
=22.1). Such a transition is known to occur via a sub-critical bifurcation (Hopf bifurcation). When Re is increased further, to 
become larger than another critical value Recr,d, the near-field symmetric semi-single vortex shedding type flow again became 
unstable, and transited to a deflected semi-single vortex shedding flow. From the simulated data, as listed in Table 3, and from Fig. 
7(b) it is ascertained that the corresponding critical Reynolds number, Recr,d = 74.4. Importantly, this transition from the 
symmetric to deflected vortex shedding flow belongs to a subcritical bifurcation (pitchfork bifurcation) scenario, as illustrated in 
Fig.7(b).  
For the sake of revealing the aspect-ratio (A) dependent growth of critical flow characteristics and thereby exhibiting a 
broader trend, the sequential wake transformations in regards to the time-averaged central-line vertical velocity ( 1.5xc,V  ) and the 
combined lift coefficients (CL,1+2 ) are explicitly extracted in Tables 4-5, and in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) we present the detailed 
 6 
 Again, for the sake of broader understanding, Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) illustrate explicit details of onset of 
instability/bifurcations with A=1.5 and A=3 aspect-ratio cylinder-pairs, while gap-ratio G =0.6 remained unchanged. Note in 
Fig.12(a) and Table 4 that, the wake transformation (transition) from the twin-symmetric [Recr,v=60.3, Fig. 5(f)] to twin-deflected 
mode behind the A=1.5 aspect-ratio cylinders takes place within a very narrow range of Re. The onset of flow deflection, as 
revealed by Fig.12 (a), occurs here through a pitchfork bifurcation of the subcritical nature. Such a deflected mode is seen to 
dominate within 61.5Re 65. Interestingly, in contrary with A=2 cylinders, the twin-symmetric periodic vortex shedding mode 
(at A=1.5) re-appeared again briefly within 67Re 68.5 (Table 4), before the flow eventually transited to the chaotic regime 
(for Re 80). On the other hand, following the onset of vortex shedding [Recr,v=89.1, Fig. 5(h)], the twin-symmetric wake behind 
the A=3 aspect-ratio cylinder-pair is seen to transit to the twin-deflected type (for Re 90, as evidenced in Table 5) through a 
pitchfork bifurcation [Fig.12(b)].  
(iv) Onset of periodic, quasi-periodic, twin vortex shedding, and bifurcation at G=1.6 
We now turn our attention to the moderate gap-ratio flows. An exploration of structural wake pattern at moderate G reveals, 
beyond some critical Re there occurs onset of unstable twin-deflected vortex shedding behind the elliptic cylinder-pair. Existence 
of such a quasi-periodic trembled flow is briefly pointed out in Table 2 (at Re=80, G=1.6, and A=2). It subsequently transits to 
the “flip-flop” vortex shedding type of flow at about Re=100 (flow number 40 in Table-2). In an attempt to elucidate gradual 
transition of this twin vortex shedding flow (which is yet to be addressed in a systematic manner), we extract the underlying 
bifurcation characteristics/physics (at G=1.6) for the A=2 aspect-ratio cylinder-pair, while varying Re very slowly.  
The flow past twin ellipses (G=1.6) retains steady-symmetric ( 1.5xc,V  =0) characteristic at low Reynolds numbers, as 
indicated vastly by our extracted data (Table 3) for various Re between 40 and 72.5. Once Re is increased to Re=75, the 
symmetric flow first transits to the periodically deflected twin vortex shedding type. However, it holds on to periodic character 
only for a very narrow range of Re. For clarity, the existence of an alternately deflected (biased) twin-vortex-shedding flow 
pattern (at Re=78, A=2 and G=1.6) is exhibited in Fig. 13(a). It reveals upwardly biased behavior (Vc,x=1.5 >0) of the simulated 
flow in the sub-domain x = [-5, 50], y = [-9, 9]. The persistence of flow-biasness (having non-zero central-line transverse velocity 
and lift-coefficient) is clearly reflected by the time-histories of Vc,x=1.5 and CL,1+2 [Figs. 13(b) and 13(c)]. However, an enlarged 
view of individual lift-coefficients (CL,1, CL,2) for the upper and the lower cylinders [Figs.13(d)-(e)] reveals occurrence of single 
frequency nearly anti-phase (periodic) vortex shedding behind the cylinders [which was rather difficult to judge from Fig. 13(a)]. 
Readers may note that, the corresponding lift-amplitudes (of CL,1 and CL,2) at this stage remained markedly different but (visually) 
uniform. This led to perfectly sinusoidal variation of the combined lift coefficient CL,1+2 [Fig. 13(f)]. The phase-space trajectory 
plots (within 2437  t 2837) of both central-line velocity (Vc,x=2.5 vs. Vc,x=0.5) and lift/drag forces (e.g. CL,1+2 vs. CD,1+2), however, 
reveal [Figs. 13(g) and 13(h)] the governing biased flow is periodic. Consequently, the trajectories (over the time) repeat for 
consecutive periods, to become simple closed loop cycles.  
Note that, such a deflected twin vortex shedding flow retained dominantly periodic character only for a very narrow range of 
Re. As Re was increased to Re=80, the periodic flow quickly became unstable and transited to a quasi-periodic vortex shedding 
mode [Fig. 14(a)] following a pitchfork bifurcation. Although this deflected quasi-periodic flow is trembled, its biased behavior 
can firstly be judged from the time-histories of Vc,x=1.5 and CL,1+2 (both having strictly non-zero time-mean values), as extracted in 
Figs. 14(b) and 14(c). An enlarged view of individual lift coefficients further reveals that the shedded vortices from the cylinders 
at this stage appear in visibly weakly anti-phase. Noteworthy in this context, the initiation of sensible amplitude 
fluctuation/modulation [Figs. 14(d) and 14(e)] of both CL,1 and CL,2 , resulting to significant temporal fluctuation of the combined 
lift coefficient CL,1+2 [Fig.14(f)], in this quasi-periodic regime. Furthermore, in a sharp contrast to Figs. 13(g) and 13(h), the 
phase-space trajectories (within 888  t 1288) of Vc x=2.5 vs. Vc,x=0.5 and CL,1+2 vs. CD,1+2 [Figs.14(g) and 14(h)] suggest that the 
governing flow is basically quasi-periodic. This is because, the consecutive trajectories from one period to the very next period 
 8 
[Fig.18(a)]. The phase-space diagrams for the flow are extracted in Figs.18(g)-(h). Note that, by nature this in-phase flow is also 
a kind of flip-flopped vortex shedding flow [as revealed by vanishing of average Vc,x=1.5 in Fig.18(b)]. 
    On the other hand, Fig. 19(a) confirms development of the anti-phase twin vortex streets, at G=3.0, behind the elliptic 
cylinder-pair. Our simulated results [Figs.18(a) and 19(a)] thereby reveal a clear consistency of the present findings with the 
existing experimental/theoretical predictions (e.g., Williamson16 and Kang28); and seem to suggest that the essential features of 
vortex shedding remain consistent for such flows. The continuation of zero central-line velocity [Fig.19(d)], and perfectly 
anti-phase synchronized growth of the lift (CL,1, CL,2) coefficients [Figs. 19(b)-(c)] further ensure the inherent anti-phase 
characteristic of vortex shedding [Fig.19(a)] in the wake. Unlike for in-phase vortex shedding flow, the equal but opposite 
natured variations of CL,1 and CL,2 in the present case contribute to the continued vanishing of CL,1+2 [Fig.19(d)] during the entire 
time-evolution. The physical symptoms associated with this anti-phase vortex shedding flow are further reflected in its 
phase-portraits [Figs.19(e)-(f)]. Since the near-wake Vc,x=1.5 and CL,1+2 remained zero, the phase-space trajectories in this case are 
conveniently presented in combinations of lift and drag coefficients, CL,1 vs. CD,1 and CL,2 vs. CD,2.  
   At this time it may be interesting to present a representative flow feature highlighting the subsequent chaotic transition. To 
this point Fig.20 illustrates the detailed flow characteristics at G=1, Re=200, and A=2. Figure 20(a) shows the in-phase locked 
shedded vortices gradually become disorganized/chaotic as they move downstream. The extracted wake signatures [Fig.20(b)] in 
the form of time-evolving Vc,x=1.5 seem to also confirm this. Moreover, unlike for the quasi-periodic situations presented above, 
the time-sequences of evolving individual/combined lift coefficients [Figs. 20(c)-(e)] now indicate the flow is indeed approaching 
a chaotic state. On the other hand, the corresponding phase-space diagrams [Figs.20(f)-(g)] suggest that the wake dynamics (at 
G=1, and Re=200) corresponds to a state of weakly chaotic transition.   
B. Wake characteristics at non-zero incidence  
   While the wake-dynamics at non-zero incidences often appeared far too complex and expensive to simulate, it looks worth to 
present here some of the results that display fundamental difference in relation to the zero-incident wake. Figure 21 illustrates the 
instability induced wake evolution characteristics behind the side-by-side elliptic cylinders at A=2, G=1, Re=200, and o20 . 
In view of our findings presented in the previous paragraph, at zero-incidence and for G=1, one would usually expect in-phase 
quasi-periodic vortex-shedding to prevail. However, the shedding process obtained at o20 appear to be fairly periodic; and 
significantly, the diverging vortices retained their anti-phase synchronized behavior [Fig.21(a)]. The variations of CL,1 and CL,2 
confirm the shedding occurs predominantly in anti-phase; and the repetitive character of phase-space trajectories [Figs. 21(g)-(h)] 
highlights near-perfect periodicity of the underlying shedding process. Noteworthy also here, the periodic fluctuation of the 
lift-force amplitudes [Figs.21(d)-(e)] at this non-zero incidence. On the other hand, Fig. 22 reveals occurrence of perfectly 
in-phase synchronized periodic vortex shedding in the wake, as the gap-ratio was increased to G=2 (by keeping incidence-angle 
o20  unchanged). Figure 23 demonstrates details of physical wake transformation at A=2, G=3.0, and o40 . Note that, 
with G=3 one would normally expect the dominance of periodic anti-phase synchronized shedding process (e.g. Fig.19); however, 
the wake pattern transformed here dramatically owing to the enhanced vortex interaction at o40 . While the wake is noted 
to preserve its near-field anti-phase synchronized features [Figs. 23(a), 23(d), 23(e)], the spatiotemporal fluctuations of Vc,x=1.5 
and CL,1+2 [Figs. 23(b) and 23(c)] indicate that the underlying (inherent) quasi-periodic distortion may facilitate an early 
near-chaotic transformation. The far-field structural growth of the wake [Fig.23(a)] and extracted phase-portraits [Figs. 23(g) and 
23(h)] seem to suggest this. However, once the incidence angle was reversed to o40 , an asymptotic return to a upward 
trembled anti-phase synchronized state (Fig.24) was facilitated, after long time was allowed to elapse. Fluctuation of the 
combined lift-coefficient [Fig.24(c)] and extracted phase-portraits [Figs. 24(g)-(h)] imply that underlying wake transition 
occurred through a quasi-periodic scenario. In view of the simulated zero-incidence results (in Section III-A), Figs. 21-24 
distinctly display how the incidence angle decisively alters/facilitate the physical transition past the elliptic cylinder-pair. While
