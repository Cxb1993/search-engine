2.  Related Work 
 
In order to have better understanding of this project, two 
related knowledge must be understood. First is the 
distinguished features and sophisticated manipulations of 
Taiwan Puppet Show [1] and the second is recent research 
of Augmented Reality.  
 
 
2.1 About Taiwan uppet how 
 
In Section 1 of this paper the history of Taiwan Puppet 
Show has been introduced.  In this section we will see the 
tricks of the operation method [1].  The puppet of Budaixi 
is controlled, and operated by palm. After fitting palm 
into the hollow part of puppet, the thumb and middle 
finger are employed to control the arms of puppet while 
the index finger is used to control the head of puppet, as 
shown in Fig 2. In traditional operation method the 
middle finger must be kept apart from the index finger an 
angle almost 90 ˚  , therefore the puppet may not be 
smoothly operated or  occupational harm may be caused 
due to the difference in genetic characteristics of hand of 
different person.  Owing to this and in order to enable the 
virtual drama to become popularized, the hand control of 
the puppet is arranged to have the index finger set apart 
from the middle finger a small angle in principle as shown 
in Fig. 3. On the other hand, since the head of the 
traditional puppet is made of wood carving, the facial 
expression is still. A series of limb movement, therefore, 
is developed to interpret human emotions, such as angry, 
shy, thinking, drunk, and so on.  These special features 
must be retained in this research so that the traditional 
culture can be imparted to the next generation through 
technology innovation.

2.2 Related Research of Augmented Reality 
 
However since the Taiwan Puppet Show is operated by 
using palm and finger as controller which shall be 
developed by employing AR technique, the hand 
segmentation or 3D reconstruction for AR shall be chosen 
as the focal point of the preliminary research.  Dr. Wu’s 
research chose “easy to use” as the goal and “hand” as 
interface [3], and chose “skin detection” as focal point of 
research which has more degrees of freedom required in 
operation as based on the operation of puppet show, but 
will consume more system resource, and will affect the 
display effectiveness of the 3D characters in the virtual 
stage.  Hence it still needs to find the simpler and easier 
way.  In the research of Kyungboo Jung a cubic with six 
different markers is employed to enable the virtual 
duplication of rigid objects from image sequence [4], the 
way employed by Kyungboo Jung is close to the design 
idea and needs of this research.  Further, the author of this 
paper found that some combined detections are needed for 
designing the markers on fingers.  The similar idea has 
been discussed in the research of Gun A, Lee [5]. And as 
for the design of marker detailed reference is included in 
the series study by H. Kato [6]. Besides, as for the 
execution of emotion movement high-level event system 
must be employed, Jean-Luc Lugrin has made a sample of 
practice [7], and an interface [8] has been developed and 
provided by R. Smith.  It was also found during 
experiment that the position of the markers on the glove 
due to the operation of the glove is changed by different 
P S
276
 
When the palm is just facing the camera, the character is 
driven by Red Cross marker on the center of palm while 
the special markers are stuck on fingers. Again take 
middle finger as an example, shown in Fig. 7 when three 
yellow markers are detected, it represents that the arms of 
the character are in open state (normal state).  When the 
middle finger bends to an angle of 90 degrees, the 
markers will display an arrangement of Blue-Yellow-
Yellow which represents that the right arm of the 
character will stretch and extend forward, and finally the 
arrangement is Green-Yellow-Yellow which represents 
that the right arm of the character will hand by the side, 
and close to body.   
 
 
Figure 7 Key point markers   
 
When the palm turns with its side facing the camera, the 
marker on the side of finger will be employed to trigger 
the movement of character’s limb. Let us continue the 
design idea stated above. The markers on one side of he 
fingers are all arranged in the same color for making sure 
the consistency of the character and the movement 
direction.  In addition, the movement of fingers becomes 
even more directive if seen from the side of the fingers.  
Hence the geometric pattern was added to the color-
marker to help identifying the specific finger and 
direction (0 degree – 90 degrees -180 degrees) as shown 
in Fig. 8. 
 
 
Figure 8 Marker with geometric pattern 
 
2. The second type of design took the angle of camera 
as the starting point by taking into consideration of 
the second problem as mentioned in section 1.  The 
operation method is similar to playing a flute.  When 
the finger presses a specific or some lattices on the 
push button panel, it will form shielding on the 
pattern of the panel, and then the camera will identify 
the remaining pattern to initiate specific movement.  
The panel and operation are shown in Fig9. 
 
 
Figure 9 Hand control panel with movements 
 
 
3.4 The peration of arge ngle otation 
 
The palm cubic is somewhat different from finger cubic. 
The palm cubic is mainly designed for the rotation 
positioning of puppet body.  As based on the design point 
of view, since palm is in flat shape, we have compared the 
movement of the puppet with the rotation angle of palm 
viewed by camera, and observed that when palm is 
turning to left side, the marker on the center of palm will 
cause the puppet to turn, but when the palm turns to an 
angle greater than 50 degrees, it is apt to cause the 
character (virtual puppet) disappear which is possibly due 
to the curvature of palm.  Owing to this we arranged a 
pair of markers on the edge of palm which can relocate 
the position and angle of the character when palm turns to 
this angular position as shown in Fig. 10.  
 
 
Figure 10 Markers on palm 
 
Both of the two methods mentioned in section 3.3 are 
suitable for the design, however the push button panel of 
the second type of design is still apt to the influence of 
angle, hence the design shall still be improved in the 
future by further modifying the panel to three-
dimensional transparent type panel design.
