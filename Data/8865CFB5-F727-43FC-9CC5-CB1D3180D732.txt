1. Introduction 
Plates with multiple circular inclusions are commonly observed in engineering structures. These inclusions, 
or inhomogeneous materials, usually take place in shapes of discontinuity such as thickness reduction due to 
corrosion or strength degradation resulting from delamination. Dynamic loadings under the circumstance 
always result in stress concentration with ensuing loading capacity reduction and fatigue failure. 
The deformation and corresponding stresses induced by dynamic loading are propagated throughout the 
structure by means of wave. At the near field of inclusion (or scatterer), scattering of flexural wave reflected 
in all directions recursively interacts with the incident wave. It turns out that the scattering of the stress wave 
results in dynamic stress concentration [1]. On the other hand, certain applications of the far field scattering 
flexural response can be found in vibration analysis or structural health-monitoring system such as the 
non-destructive inspection. 
Nishimura and Jimbo [2] are two pioneer investigators to analytically study dynamic stress concentration. 
They calculated the stresses in the vicinity of a spherical inclusion in the elastic solid under harmonic force. 
Pao [3] studied the scattering of flexural waves and dynamic stress concentrations around a circular hole, and 
proposed an analytical solution. Since then, most research has focused on the scattering of elastic wave and 
dynamic stress concentration and has led to a rapid development of analytical or numerical approach such as 
wave function expansion method, complex variable method, boundary integral equation method (BIEM) and 
boundary element method (BEM) [1].  
Leviatan et al. [4] presented a source-model technique for the scattering analysis of a time-harmonic 
flexural wave in a thin elastic plate by a small patch made of material other than that of the plate. However, 
the fictitious sources are located at a certain distance away from the boundary of the patch. By using the flux 
conservation relation and optical theorem, Norris et al. [5] considered the scattering of flexural waves by 
circular inclusions with different plate properties and obtained numerical results. Squire et al. [6] applied the 
wave function expansion method to study the scattering properties of a single coated cylindrical anomaly 
located in a thin plate on which flexural waves propagate. Wang [7] presented a theoretical and experimental 
investigation of the scattering behavior of extensional and flexural plate waves by a cylindrical inhomogeneity. 
Peng [8] investigated flexural wave scattering and dynamic stress concentration in a heterogeneous plate with 
multiple cylindrical patches by using acoustical wave propagator technique. The predicted result of the 
principal stress was compared with the exact analytical solution in a thin plate without patches. Nevertheless, 
predicted results of dynamic stress concentration were not verified by any independent method. Recently, one 
monograph is devoted to discussing the multiple scattering in acoustics, electromagnetism, seismology and 
hydrodynamics [9].   
From literature reviews stated previously, few papers except [8] have been published to date reporting the 
scattering of flexural wave in plate with more than one inclusion. Recently, authors proposed a semi-analytical 
null-field integral equation method for eigensolution of a circular plate with multiple circular holes [10]. The 
advantage of this approach is employing the degenerate kernel to avoid calculating principal values, which is 
of great difficulties in the case of plate. The introduction of degenerate kernel in companion with the Fourier 
series was proved to yield the exponential convergence [11] instead of the linear algebraic convergence in 
BEM. Furthermore, Kobayashi and Nishimura [12] pointed out that the integral equation method seems to be 
most effective to deal with two-dimensional steady-state flexural wave problems.  
This project extends the null-field integral approach to the external plate problem to solve scattering of 
flexural waves by multiple circular inclusions in a thin plate. A linear algebraic system can be constructed by 
uniformly collocating points on the boundary and taking finite terms of Fourier series. The displacement and 
corresponding section force are calculated by using boundary integral equations for the domain point after

to the kernel ( )xs,U  with respect to the source point, where /∂ ∂n and / t∂ ∂ are the normal and tangential 
derivatives, respectively, 2∇  means the Laplacian operator.  
2.3 Null-field integral equations 
The null-field integral equations of displacement can be derived from Eq.(2) and by collocating the field 
point outside the domain, as follows:

where CΩ  is the complementary domain of Ω . It is noted that once kernel functions are expressed in proper 
degenerate forms, which will be described in the next subsection, the collocation points can be exactly located 
on the real boundary, that is x∈ BC ∪Ω . The other two null-field integral equations can be derived by 
substituting Eq.(8) into Eq.(6) and Eq. (7), respectively, and the explicit expressions can be seen in [10].   
2.4 Adaptive observer system, degenerate kernels and Fourier series for boundary densities 
Consider an infinite thin plate with multiple circular inclusions as shown in Fig. 1. Since the direct boundary 
integral equations are frame indifferent (i.e. rule of objectivity), the origin of the observer system can be 
adaptively located on the center of each circle under integration. In the adaptive polar coordinate, the field point 
and source point can be expressed as ( ,ρ φ ) and ( ,R γ ), respectively. By employing the addition theorem [15], 
the kernel function ),( xsU is expanded in the series form as follows:

where mε  is the Neumann factor ( mε =1, m=0 ; mε =2, m=1,2," ,∞) and the superscripts "I" and "E" denote the 
interior and exterior cases for ),( xsU  degenerate kernels to distinguish ρ<R  and ρ>R , respectively as 
shown in Figure 2. The degenerate kernels ( , )s xΘ , ( , )M s x  and ( , )V s x  in the null-field boundary integral 
equations can be obtained by applying the operators of Eqs.(5)-(7) to the degenerate kernel ( , )U s x  with 
respect to the source point s.  
In order to fully utilize the geometry of circular boundary, the displacement ( )u s , slope ( )sθ , moment ( )m s  
and shear force ( )v s  along the circular boundaries in the null-field integral equations can be expanded in terms 
of Fourier series, respectively, as shown below:

to analyze the plate problem. By uniformly collocating N (=2M+1) points on each circular boundary in Eqs. (8) 
and (9), we have

In the jB  integration, the origin of the observer system is adaptively located at the center jo  from which 
the degenerate kernels and Fourier series are described. The selection of interior or exterior degenerate kernel 
depends on  or R Rρ ρ< > , respectively, according to the observer system. By using orthogonal property, a

For brevity, a unified form [
ijU ] ( 1,2,3, ,i H= "  and 1,2,3, ,j H= " ) denote the response of ( , )U s x  
kernel at the ith circle point due to the source at the jth circle. Otherwise, the same definition is for [
ijΘ ], [ ijM ], 
[
ijV ], [
ijUθ ], [
ij
θΘ ], [ ijMθ ] and [ ijθV ] kernels. The explicit expressions for sub-vectors [ iu ], [ iθ ], [ im ] and [ iv ] 
can be described as follows:

where the subscript i denotes the incidence part. By substituting Equations (29)-(32) into Eq. (27) and then 
combining with Eq.(28), the system for an infinite plate containing two inclusions, for instance, can be

Figures 9(a) and 9(b) show the polar plot of dynamic moment concentration factors on the circular boundary of 
the matrix and inclusion, respectively, by using the present method and FEM. Good agreements can be 
observed. 
Figure 10 shows the far field scattering patterns for a flexible inclusion with h1=h/2 at dimensionless wave 
numbers ka = 0.1, 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0. As ka increases, the scattering pattern inclines toward forward scattering and 
the associated scattering amplitude also get increasing. Figure 11 shows the far field backscattering amplitude 
versus the dimensionless wave number. The surrounding plate is steel of thickness 0.025m and solid line stands 
for hole, dash line for rigid inclusion and dash-dot line for inclusion with thickness 0.0125m. The rigid inclusion 
means the clamped boundary condition around the circular boundary. The proposed results shown in figure 11 
match well with those reported in [5]. It can be found that the amplitude for the radiation (or scattering) response 
in the far field is O ( 1/ 2ρ− ) to satisfy the radiation condition. 
To demonstrate the flexural scattering by multiple inclusions, two identical uncoated inclusions were 
considered in Figure 12, where L is the central distance. In the following simulation, the dimensionless central 
distance L/a will be used. For L/a = 2.1, Figure 13 shows the DMCF on the upper circular boundary of inclusion, 
at / 2π− , versus the dimensionless wave number by using different number of Fourier series terms. The results 
using fewer Fourier series terms such as M = 4, 6 show some peaks at ka = 3.2, 4.6. They are found to be 
identical to the true eigenvalues, 3.196, 4.610 [16], of the clamped circular plate with radius equaling to that of 
the inclusion. Actually they are the so-called fictitious frequencies of the external problem. It demonstrates that 
the increasing number of Fourier series terms can suppress the appearance of fictitious frequencies. 
For L/a = 2.1, figure 14 shows the distribution of DMCF on the upper circular boundary, including plate and 
inclusion, by using both the present method and FEM. It indicates that the maximum DMCF is larger than that 
of one, as shown in Figure 9, due to the narrow space between two inclusions. Figures 15 and 16 show the far 
field scattering patterns for two flexible inclusions with h1=h/2 and L/a=2.1, 10.0, respectively, at ka = 0.1, 1.0, 
3.0 and 5.0. After Comparing with the results of one inclusion presented in Figure 10, the far field scattering 
amplitude of two inclusions is more or less twice as large as that of one. In addition, the associated fluctuation 
along the angular direction of two inclusions is more evident than that of only one. Moreover, this trend 
becomes obvious as the dimensionless central distance increases. 
Case 2: An infinite plate with coated inclusions [6] 
An infinite plate containing one coated inclusion with inner and outer radius of a and b, respectively, subject 
to the incident flexural wave with 0 0φ =  was considered in Figure 17. Comparing with uncoated inclusion, 
Convergence study indicates that the rate of convergence decreases and the required number of terms to 
convergence increases due to the complicated configuration of the coated inclusion. However the numerical 
results agree well with those by using FEM. 
An infinite plate with (1) an unstepped and stepped indentation, and (2) an unstepped and stepped protrusion, 
subject to the incident flexural wave with 0 0φ =  was considered [6]. Figures 18 and 19 show the far field 
backscattering amplitude versus the dimensionless wave number for indentation and protrusion, respectively. 
The results shown in Figures 18 and 19 match well with those of Norris and Vemula [5] for uncoated inclusion 
and agree with those of Squire [6] for the coated inclusion except at larger wave number. It indicates that, for 
unstepped cases, the far field backscattering amplitude of indentation increases with the wave number 
increasing but that of protrusion decreases. For stepped cases, the far field backscattering amplitudes are more 
complicated and the number of troughs increases.

1 Introduction 
Circular plates with multiple circular holes are widely used in engineering 
structures [1], e.g. missiles, aircraft, etc. These holes usually cause the change of 
natural frequency as well as the decrease of load carrying capacity. It is 
important to comprehend the associated effects in the work of mechanical design 
or flight control of the structure. As quoted by Leissa [2]: "the free vibrations of 
circular plates have been of practical and academic interest for at least a century 
and a half", we revisit this problem by proposing an analytical method. 
Over the past few decades, most of the researches have focused on the analytical 
solutions for natural frequencies of the circular or annular plates [3-6]. Recently 
some researchers intended to extend an annular plate [7, 8] to the plate with an 
eccentric hole. Lee et al. [9, 10] proposed a semi-analytical approach to solve the 
free vibration analysis of a circular plate with multiple holes and pointed out 
some insufficient accurate results in [8] after careful comparisons. 
It is clear that the number of variables can be dramatically decreased by using 
boundary element method (BEM) or boundary integral equation method (BIEM). 
For BEM applications to plate problems, readers may consult with the review 
article [11]. By using the BIEM to analytically solve the problem of plate with 
multiple holes, two questions need to be solved. One is the improper integral in 
the boundary integral equation; the other is that both field point and source point 
are located on different circular boundaries. These problems have been treated by 
using the degenerate kernel and tensor transformation [9, 10], respectively. But 
tensor transformation accompanied with the higher order derivative increases the 
complexity of computation and then affect the accuracy of its solution [9]. In 
addition, the collocation method in [9, 10] belongs to point-matching approach 
instead of analytical derivation. It also increases the effort of computation since 
boundary nodes for collocation are required. 
This paper presents an analytical approach to solve the multiple-connected 
domain plate problem by using the null field integral formulation, addition 
theorem and complex Fourier series. Some numerical computations are 
presented. Moreover, the SVD updating technique [10] is employed to suppress 
the appearance of spurious eigenvalues. 
2 Problem statement & direct boundary integral formulations. 
2.1 Problem statement of plate eigenproblem 
As shown in fig.1, a uniform thin circular plate with H circular holes centred at 
Ok (k=0,1,…,H) has a domain Ω  which is enclosed with boundary

where CΩ  is the complementary domain of Ω . It is noted that once kernel 
functions are expressed in proper degenerate forms, the field points can be 
exactly located on the real boundary, that is x∈ BC ∪Ω .  
2.4 Degenerate kernels and Fourier series for boundary densities  
In the polar coordinate, the field point and source point can be expressed as ( φρ , ) 
and ( ,R θ ), respectively. By employing the addition theorem [13], the kernel 
function U(s, x) is expanded in the series form as follows:

The displacement u(s), slope ( )sθ , moment m(s) and shear force v(s) along the 
circular boundaries in the null-field integral equations can be expanded in terms 
of complex Fourier series, respectively, as shown below:

3 Analytical eigensolution for a circular plate with multiple 
circular holes 
To present formulation clearly and without the lose of geniality, a clamped 
circular plate (u0 = θ0 = 0) with H circular holes subject to free edge (mk = vk = 0; 
k=1,…,H ) is considered. Considering the null field near the circular boundary B0, 
eqn. (9) can be explicitly expressed as: 
where (
p pρ φ, )and ( k kρ φ, ) shown in fig. 3 are the polar coordinates of a general 
field point x with respect to Op and Ok, which are origins of two polar coordinate 
system and (
pk pkr θ, ) are the polar coordinates of Ok with respect to Op. 
By using the addition theorem for Bessel functions ( )m kJ λρ , ( )m kY λρ  and 
( )m kK λρ , eqn. (16) near the circular boundary B0 under the condition of 0 0krρ >  
can be expanded as follows:

eqn. (37) results in a couple infinite system of simultaneous linear algebraic 
equations for the coefficients kma , 
k
mb , 
k
mc  and kmd , k=0,…, H. In the following 
computation, only the finite M terms are used in eqn. (37). According to the 
direct-searching scheme [12], the eigenvalue are obtained by applying the SVD 
technique [15] to the matrix from eqn. (37). Once the eigenvalues are found, the 
associated mode shapes can be obtained by substituting the corresponding 
boundary eigenvectors (i.e. the complex Fourier series representing the fictitious 
boundary density) into the boundary integral equations. 
4 Spurious eigenvalue for multiply-connected plate 
eigenproblem using BEM  
In this section, SVD updating technique is adopted to suppress the appearance of 
spurious eigenvalue which cause the present method fail. The concept of this 
technique is to provide sufficient constrains to overcome the rank deficiency of 
the system. Since four null field integral equations for the plate formulation are 
provided [10], there are 6 (C (4,2)) options for choosing any two equations to 
solve the eigenproblem. The UΘ  formulation in section 3 uses the first and the 
second equations. To provide sufficient constrains, the UM formulation is 
alternative, which uses the first and the third equations. Applying the moment 
operator of eqn. (17), to eqns. (24) and (31), respectively, yield 
singular value versus the frequency parameter by using the UΘ  formulation, UM 
formulation and SVD updating technique for a circular clamped plate with three 
circular holes. Since the direct-searching scheme is used, the drop location 
indicates the eigenvalue. The spurious eigenvalues of 5.5811 and 7.9906 occur 
when using the UM and UΘ formulation, respectively. They are found to be the 
true eigenvalue of simply-supported and clamped circular plate with a radius of 
0.4 m, respectively. It demonstrates that the spurious eigenvalue can be filtered 
out by using the SVD updating technique. The same problem is also solved by 
using ABAQUS and its model has 308960 elements in order to obtain 
comparable results for comparison. The former five natural frequency parameters 
and modes by using the present method, the semi-analytical method [10] and 
FEM are shown in fig. 7. Good agreement between the results of the present 
method and those of ABAQUS is observed. 
6 Concluding remarks 
Natural frequencies and natural modes of a circular plate with multiple circular 
holes have analytically solved by using the null field integral formulation and the 
addition theorem. Based on the addition theorem, two critical problems of 
improper integration in the boundary integration and the higher derivative in the 
multiply-connected domain problems were successively treated in a novel way. 
By matching the specified boundary conditions, an analytical solution can be 
derived from a couple infinite systems of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. 
By using the direct-searching method, numerical eigensolutions were given from 
the corresponding truncated finite system. The proposed results match well with 
those provided by the FEM using many elements to obtain acceptable data for 
comparison. In addition, the SVD technique of updating terms has successfully 
dealt with spurious eigenvalues. Numerical results show good accuracy and fast 
rate of convergence thanks to the analytical method.
