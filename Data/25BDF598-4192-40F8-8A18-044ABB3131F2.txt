2because failures are not likely to occur in a
reasonable amount of time. In such cases, if
there exists product characteristics whose
degradation over time can be related to
reliability, then collecting “degradation data”
can provide information about product
reliability. Nelson [24] surveyed literature on
this subject. Nelson [25] also surveyed the
literature on theory for degradation testing.
Lu & Meeker [22] used a mixed-effect
model to estimate the failure time
distribution. Tseng et al. [32] used a
linearized degradation model to improve the
fluorescent lamp reliability. In addition, by
minimizing the variance of the estimated
100p-th percentile of a product's lifetime
distribution, Yu & Tseng [39] addressed the
problems of how to determine the optimal
design (i.e., the optimal setting of the sample
size, the inspection frequency, and the
termination time) for a linearized
degradation model where the degradation
rates follow lognormal distributions.
Similarly, by using the criterion of
minimizing the variance of the estimated
100p-th percentile of a product's lifetime
distribution, Wu & Chang [37] investigated
the optimal combination of these decision
variables for a degradation test with the
nonlinear mixed-effect model proposed by
Lu & Meeker [22]. Degradation models
based on mixed-effect and random-effect
models have also been considered by [1], [2],
[8], [21], and [41]. Besides these, Wiener
and gamma processes are two famous
stochastic processes which have been used
by a number of excellent studies to model
the process of degradation in units or
systems. For example, for the former, it has
been considered by [5], [12], [13], [14], [29],
[33], [35], [38], and [40]; while, for the latter,
it has been considered by [6], [11], [15], [19],
[20], [26], and [34].
As to the lifetime distributions
considered in the studies mentioned above,
the lifetime of an item is usually defined as
the first passage time (FPT) that its
performance deteriorates to reach a
pre-specified critical level. Then, if the
performance degradation of an item follows
a Wiener diffusion process, then the lifetime
of the item follows an inverse Gaussian
distribution (see [9] and [28],); while, if the
performance degradation of an item follows
a gamma process, then the lifetime of the
item can be approximated by a
Birnbaum-Saunders distribution (see [31]).
In addition to these, for the linearized
degradation models considered in [32] and
[39], the life times follow lognormal and
Weibull distributions, if the degradation
rates follow lognormal and reciprocal
Weibull distributions, respectively. Notice
that the distributions considered in the
above-mentioned studies are all those
without failure-free life. Here, failure-free
life is characterized by a threshold parameter
below which no failure is possible. In
practice, as the quality of products has been
improved, some kinds of products will
exhibit a period of failure-free life,
especially for electronic industries (see [30]).
However, there have been no studies which
investigated degradation tests where the
lifetime distributions are those with
failure-free life.
The two-parameter exponential
distribution is one of the life distributions
with failure-free life. Some references on the
two-parameter exponential distribution can
be found in [7], [16], [27], and [36]. Tang et
al. [30] considered optimal test plans for an
ALT with censored two-parameter
exponential distributions. The main purpose
of this project is to consider the problem of
determining the optimal setting of the
inspection frequency, the sample size and
the termination time for a degradation test
where the lifetime of the product follows a
two-parameter exponential distribution.
More specifically, with respect to a
degradation test (DT) where a linearized
degradation model is used to model the
degradation process and the lifetime is
assumed to follow a two-parameter
exponential lifetime distribution, under the
constraint that the total experimental cost
does not exceed a predetermined budget, the
optimal decision variables are obtained by
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE)

In the next section, we will re-analyze the
LED data in Yu and Tseng (2004) to
illustrate this procedure.
4. Motivating Example
Referring to Yu and Tseng (2004), Figure 1
is the plot of  0.51( ) 1j ky t    versus 3/1kt . It
shows that Equation (1) with
 0.51( ) 1x x   and 1 3   is
appropriate to model the degradation paths
of the LED lamps.

normal probability plot for residuals (shown
in Figure 3) indicate that it is reasonable to
assume ),(~  TExp  and jk ~  2,0 N .
By Equations (16) and (7), the parameters
 ,  , and 2  can be estimated as
follows:
( l~ , l~ , 2ˆ )
= (10984.640,4733.134,0.0007958428).
In the following paragraph, we will treat
them as the true values of ( , , 2 )to
evaluate the optimal test plan of LED data.
*** Figures 2 and 3 ***
Set p = 0.05, ut = 24 hours and
7500bC  . Then, the optimal test plans for
the degradation test of LED with 0.01 
and 0.025 under various cost conditions ( pC ,
