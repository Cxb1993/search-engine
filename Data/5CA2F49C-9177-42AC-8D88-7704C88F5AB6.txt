crushing, elastic buckling and brittle fracturing are taken 
into consideration. 
CELL GEOMETRY  
An idealized unit cell model as illustrated in Figure 1 is 
typically utilized to generate the failure surfaces of 
anisotropic open-cell foams.  The model is composed of 
four vertical cell struts of length h  and eight horizontal 
cell struts of length l .  Each cell strut has a rectangular 
cross-sectional area 2t .  The relative density of the 
anisotropic open-cell foam can be related to its cell 
geometrical parameters l , h  and t :

Wherein, *ρ  is the density of the anisotropic open-cell 
foam,
sρ  is the density of solid cell struts.  An extended 
regular hexagonal prism model as illustrated in Figure 2 is 
introduced to analyze the elastic buckling of anisotropic 
open-cell foams.  In the model, three cell struts of length 
l  meet at equal angles of o120  on the 21 XX −  plane 
and are perpendicular to the other cell struts of length h . 
PLASTIC YIELDING 
First, when the anisotropic open-cell foam is subjected to 
the uniaxial loading along the 3X  direction, its plastic 
yielding strength *
3,plσ  can be derived from the applied 
bending moment exerted on solid cell struts reaching the 
fully plastic moment of any cross-section of solid cell 
struts:

Where 1aC  and ysσ  in Equations (1) and (2) are a 
microstructural coefficient and the yielding strength of 
solid cell struts, respectively.  Further, Equations (1) and 
(2) are reduced to ( ) ysspl σρρσ 23** 3.0=  for isotropic 
open-cell foams [1] by setting 1=hl , giving 
55.01 =aC . 
For analysis, an overall pseudo-isotropic behavior is 
assumed for anisotropic foams.  In other words, the 
uniaxial strengths of the anisotropic foam in three principal 
directions are assumed to be the same, namely 
*
3,
*
2,
*
1, plplpl σσσ == .  This assumption causes the yielding 
strengths of solid cell struts of the three principal directions 
to have a ratio:

Here, the yielding strength of solid cell struts along the 3X  
direction are assumed to be 
ysσ  and then those along the 
1X  and 2X  directions are yskσ . 
When isotropic open-cell foams are loaded under three 
same principal stresses *
1σ , *2σ  and *3σ , the cell struts 
within them suffer only axial tension or compression.  The 
axial tensile or compressive stress exerted on each cell strut, 
aσ , is [2]:  
( )sma ρρ
σσ *3=                           (5) 
Where the mean hydrostatic stress, mσ , equals ( ) 3*3*2*1 σσσ ++ .  The constant 3 in Equation (5) arises 
from that the applied load in any principal direction is 
carried by only one-third of cell struts within open-cell 
foams.  On the other hand, the deviatoric stress for 
isotropic open-cell foams under multiaxial stresses can be 
expressed in terms of the three principal stresses [2]: 
( ) ( ) ( )[ ]2*1*32*3*22*2*121 σσσσσσσ −+−+−=d     (6) 
Thus, under any multiaxial stresses, solid cell struts within 
the pseudo isotropic open-cell foams will suffer bending as 
well as axial tension or compression.   
For the direction 3X , the resulting bending moment 
exerted on solid cell struts is proportional to the product of 
dσ  and 3l :

When the applied bending moment reaches the fully plastic 
moment of any cross-section of solid cell struts, plastic 
yielding failure occurs.  Consequently, the theoretical 
expression for describing the failure surfaces of plastic 
yielding of anisotropic open-cell foams in the direction 3X  
under multiaxial stresses is:

ELASTIC BUCKLING 
For the failure mechanism of elastic buckling, an extended 
regular hexagonal prism model as illustrated in Figure 2 is 
used to replace the existing unit cell model.  In the case of 
uniaxial loading, one member (identified as AB in Figure 2) 
carries a predominantly axial load and tends to buckle.  
The critical compressive force of the vertical cell struts is 
found to be [5]:

Where sE  is the Young’s modulus of solid cell struts, 
3 /12I t=  is the moment of inertia and 
3X
n  is a constant 
corresponding to the rotational stiffness at both ends of the 
buckled cell struts.  The constant 
3X
n  depends on the 
restoring bending moment imposed by the other cell struts 
(identified as AC, AD and AE in Figure 2); that is, the 
degree of constraint at a vertex connected by the four cell 
struts is of importance and should be specified.  Once the 
constant 
3X
n  is determined, the elastic buckling strength 
along the 3X  direction for anisotropic open-cell foams 
*
3,elσ  can be calculated from the critical compressive force 
of Equation (25) by dividing it over the cross-sectional area 
of solid cell struts, giving:

πσ =                             (26) 
Where C  is a microstructural coefficient.  However, the 
difficulty in analyzing the elastic buckling strength is the 
calculation of the rotational stiffness at the vertex 
connected by the cell struts.  Therefore, some buckled 
shapes of solid cell struts are assumed to calculate the 
elastic buckling strength of isotropic open-cell foams under 
multiaxial stresses. 
The buckled shapes of the four cell struts for anisotropic 
open-cell foams as illustrated in Figure 5 are based on those 
of hexagonal honeycombs [6] as shown in Figure 6 because 
they have a similar bending deformation mechanism. 
When anisotropic open-cell foams are subjected to a 
general state of multiaxial stresses *1σ , *2σ  and *3σ , each 
cell strut lying on the 21 XX −  plane is assumed to 
deflect from the 21 XX −  plane which is perpendicular to 
the 3X  direction while the buckled strut is assumed to 
deflect on the 32 XX −  plane.  From equilibrium, the 
resulting forces parallel to the 1X , 2X  and 3X  axes as 
illustrated in Figure 7 can be related to the remote applied 
multiaxial stresses *1σ , *2σ  and *3σ :

For any buckled shape of the regular hexagonal prism 
model, the slope-deflection theorem [4] can be used to find 
the relationships between the rotational angles and the 
bending moments at both ends of the cell struts AB, AC , 
AD and AE.  For example, the slope-deflection theorem 
for the cell strut AB can be expressed as: 
 6
the other is αβγ ==  for Mode II-2.  For the two cases 
of buckling mode, the following relations can be obtained 
at node A and cell strut AB from equilibrium, respectively:

BABABAB MhPM =+ θ                           (50) 
Similarly, due to the slope-deflection theorem and the 
buckled shapes, the failure criteria for Mode II-1 and Mode 
II-2 buckling can be obtained, respectively:

Mode III 
The deformation and rotation of cell strut AB is set to be 
the same as that in Mode II.  Here, the other three cell 
struts are divided into two groups; the first is cell strut AC 
and the second includes cell struts AD and AE.  Also, two 
cases are of concern.  For Mode III-1 as illustrated in 
Figure 5(c), the deformation and rotation of cell struts AD 
and AE are set to be the same as those of cell strut AB with 
a rotational angle of Aθ  at node A and Bθ  at node B 
while cell strut AC bend with a angle of α  at its both 
ends.  For Mode III-2, the deformation and rotation of the 
two groups of cell struts are opposite to each other as 
illustrated in Figure 5(d). 
Mode III-1 
For Mode III-1, equilibrium requires that:

III-1 for 5.0=lh , Mode II-1 and Mode III-1 for 
0.1=lh  and Mode II-1 and Mode III-2 for 5.1=lh .  
Meanwhile, each fracture surface is composed of a pair of 
straight lines intersecting with the corresponding yielding 
surfaces at two points for 5.0=lh  and 0.1  while 
intersecting with the corresponding yielding and buckling 
surfaces at two points for 5.1=lh .  Wherein, one of 
the pair of straight lines is from the fracturing strength 
along the 3X  direction while the other is the most critical 
strength along the 1X  or 2X  direction, that is Type II 
for 5.0=lh , 0.1  and Type I for 5.1=lh .  Noting 
that the modulus of rupture of solid cell struts for ductile 
foams is considered to be equal to their yielding strength.  
Except in the tension-tension quadrant, the intersection 
points between the yielding surfaces and the buckling 
surfaces could be located at any position. 
For open-cell brittle foams, the crushing surfaces are 
obtained from the most critical crushing criterion of 
Equations (15) and (16).  In the compression-compression 
quadrant, the crushing surfaces, however, are truncated by 
the two critical corresponding buckling surfaces, as 
mentioned above.  Meanwhile, there is an intersection 
point between a fracture surface and a crushing surface 
located in a compression-tension quadrant.  
CONCLUSIONS 
The failure surfaces corresponding to various failure 
mechanisms including elastic buckling, plastic yielding, 
brittle crushing and fracturing are used to construct the 
complete failure envelopes for anisotropic open-cell foams.  
The elastic buckling surfaces dominate only for the 
quadrants in which at least one principal stress is 
compressive.  The brittle fracturing surfaces are governed 
by the maximum principal tensile stress imposed on 
anisotropic open-cell foams.  In addition, the brittle 
fracturing failure depends on whether or not a pre-existing 
crack within anisotropic open-cell foams is larger than 
their cell size.  If no large crack is present, the foams fail 
by brittle crushing or by plastic yielding when they are 
subjected to multiaxial tensile stresses.  On the contrary, a 
pre-existing crack reduces the fracture strength of 
anisotropic open-cell foams.  Consequently, brittle 
fracture failure occurs when the maximum principal tensile 
stress in the first unbroken cell strut reaches its modulus of 
rupture, giving the corresponding fracture strength. 
For ductile foams, different failure mechanisms should be 
taken into account: plastic yielding, elastic buckling and 
fracturing.  Thus, the failure envelopes of ductile foams 
subjected to an axisymmetric stress state are first 
constructed from plastic yielding surfaces and then 
truncated by fracturing surfaces and elastic buckling 
surfaces.  Due to anisotropy, the failure of cell struts 
along the three principal directions will not coincide.  
Each failure mechanism will be dominated by the criterion 
along the critical principal direction.  In the case of elastic 
buckling, the failure surfaces are primarily caused by two 
possible buckling modes.  In addition, the slopes of the 
failure surfaces vary with the anisotropy ratio; when the 
anisotropy ratio 0.1=lh , the slopes of the failure 
surfaces is equal to 1.0.   
For brittle foams, brittle crushing, elastic buckling and 
fracturing are the three possible failure mechanisms.  
Therefore, the failure envelopes of brittle foams can be 
generated from the brittle crushing surfaces, elastic 
buckling surfaces and fracturing surfaces of anisotropic 
open-cell foams.  Also, each failure mechanism will be 
dominated by the failure criterion along the critical 
principal direction again.  Finally, it can be said that the 
failure envelopes of anisotropic open-cell foams are 
significantly affected by the material properties of solid 
cell struts, their relative density and the anisotropy ratio.
