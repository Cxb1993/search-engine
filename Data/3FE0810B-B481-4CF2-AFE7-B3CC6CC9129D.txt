Abstract 
  Polyporus umbellatus was one of the most famous traditional Chinese medicinal 
mushrooms and has been termed as Grifola umbellata or chuling in scientific reports. One of 
the problems while cultivating Polyporus umbellatus was that its mycelia growth was much 
slower as compared to that of other mushroom species. In this study, a brownish Polyporus 
umbellatus broth concentrate (PBC) harvested at the beginning of the growth phase was 
collected and used as an additive in the medium to test its effect on helping the mycelium 
germination. The result showed that the addition of PBC in solid-state culture could help the 
mycelia grow faster. Meanwhile, the PBC addition in submerged culture could strikingly 
shorten the lag phase. The results illustrated that PBC possessed the ability to stimulate 
Grifola umbellata growth in all respects.

to limit its accumulation[3-10]. 
It is considered to be producing acetate when there are excess carbon source or 
oxygen-limiting condition. Growth of E. Coli on excess glucose, the carbon flux 
through glycolysis exceeds the capacity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle[11, 12] , 
causes the accumulation of acetate. The physiological background for acetate 
formation has found to be a result of unbalancing between carbon flux into the central 
metabolic pathway and biosynthetic demands within the cell[13, 14]. Aristos et al [15] 
have been reported that acetate concentration ranging between 1 and 30g/L of culture 
owing to growth medium composition and propagation technique utilized. Lowry et 
al[16] have been demonstrated that the effect of carbon and nitrogen source on the 
level of metabolic intermediates in Escherichia coli.. Consequently, growth media 
play a very important role in the level of metabolic acid-product in Escherichia coli. 
Nevertheless, many reports have been focus on the carbon source causing acetate 
formation as well as controlling the concentration of the carbon source in the culture 
broth[17-20]. In addition, ammonia served as the nitrogen source and was used to 
control pH[21, 22]. Information on the effect of ammonia nitrogen source on acetate 
accumulation by recombinant E. coli is relatively scarce. Furthermore, no general rule 
can be derived from the available information since the various media composition 
and host/vector systems reported behave differently. For instance, Koh et al[23] 
reported that the extent of acetate inhibition on growth rate of different host and 
cultivated in defined and complex media. Van de Walle and Shiloach [13]reported on 
the ability of  two recombinant E. coli strains to produce acetate in the presence of 
high levels of glucose. 
Therefore, it is necessary to understand the relationship between nitrogen source 
and the amount of acetate excreted by the organism during growth. The objective of 
this research was to investigate the impact of various nitrogen conditions on acetate 
accumulation of recombinant E. coli SH1 as well as subsequent effect on cell growth 
and recombinant protein production. 
2.Materials and methods 
 2.1 Bacterial strain 
 
A recombinant Escherichia coli SH1 (ATCC9637) harbouring pGL-5 with 
chloramphenicol resistance was employed in this work[24]. This strain is capable of 
producing PGA constitutively. 
 10
degassed 0.1 M KH2PO4 (pH 1.5) with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Samples were 
acidified to pH 2 with 5N HCl then centrifuged and filtered before injection. The 
injected volume was 20µL. The absorbance was measured using a UV 
spectrophotometer at 214 nm. 
 2.5 chemicals 
 
The chemicals used in this study were at least reagent grade for medium 
preparations and analytical grade for analysis purposes. All the chemicals were 
purchased from conventional commercial sources. 
3. Results and discussion 
0.5% ammonia case 
 
Cultivation results for recombinant E.coli SH1 with medium containing 0.5% 
ammonia are shown in Fig1.. The density of biomass (10.12g-DCW/L) was obtained 
after 8hrs cultivation. For the first 8hr, the specific growth rate was constant (0.12h-1) 
and then it decreases gradually. The glucose was enough and sustained throughout 
fermentation experiment, whereas ammonium concentration was exhausted after 8hrs 
cultivation. Owing to insufficient nitrogen sources, the cell growth reached stationary 
phase in advance. In addition, glucose uptake was kept on from 8hr to 12hr and the 
cell growth almost stopped after 8hrs. This indicated that glucose uptake was 
supported to cell maintenance as well as nitrogen source was the limiting factor for 
cell growth. In turn, PGA activity showed growth-associated behavior. That was, PGA 
activity closed followed biomass during exponential growth. For the culture shown in 
Fig1., PGA activity increase to 2.4 IU/ml during the first 8hr. 
In order to investigate the metabolic by-product during the cultivation, 
fermentation broth was centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed for the organic 
acids concentration by a high-pressure liquid chromatography. It was found that the 
major by-product was acetate. This was consistent that acetate accumulated gradually 
when glucose was consumed during the fermentation of E. coli and was inhibitory to 
the cell growth with reported by Robbins and Taylor[20]. Lee and Chang[8] reported 
that acetic acid was the main inhibitory by-product of recombinant E. coli producing 
penicillin G acylase and cell growth ceased when its concentration reached 14 g/L. 
 12
2.5% ammonia case 
 
Time course of recombinant E. coli SH1 cultivation with medium containing 2.5 
% ammonia case was shown in Fig. 3. The highest cell concentration and PGA 
volumetric activity were 16.09 g DCW/l and 3.37 IU/ml respectively. However, cell 
concentration and PGA activity were lower than that in 1.5% ammonium sulfate case. 
In other words, the yield in 2.5% ammonia decreased to 67.4 IU/g-glucose. According 
to glucose and ammonium concentration shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the consumption 
ratio for ammonium sulfate to glucose was lower compared to 1.5% ammonium case, 
therefore cell concentration and PGA activity declined. This indicated that higher 
ammonia concentration (2.5%) was not suggested when cultivating recombinant E. 
coli. This was compatible that higher ammonia concentration would be the inhibited 
factor [29]. The concentration of acetic acid during cultivation was analyzed and the 
result was shown in Fig. 3. Trace amount of acetic acid accumulated, which expressed 
the same pattern as observed in 1.5% ammonium sulfate. 
 
Summary of ammonium effects 
 
The result of different ammonium concentration was summarized in Table 2. The 
highest cell concentration and yield would be obtained in 1.5% ammonium 
concentration. It was found that the initial ammonium concentration played critical 
role in cultivation of rE. coli producing penicillin G acylase. Adequate ammonia 
concentration would increase cell growth rate and reduce the metabolic by-product 
production. In addition, the ammonia concentration and acetate concentration did not 
affect enzyme specific activity. The average specific activity was maintained at about 
206 IU/g-DCW. This implied that acetate concentration had no influence on 
constitutive enzyme production. The heterogeneous protein production was not 
inhibited by acetate would be correlate with the strain specific.

Optimization of cultivation conditions on fungichromin production from 
Streptomyces padanus PMS-702 
 
Yung-Chuan Liu and Wei-Chen Lin 
 
Abstract 
  
A novel discovered strain named Streptomyces padanus PMS-702, harbouring antifungal 
activity, was used to produce polyene macrolide antibiotic, fungichromin, in various 
cultivation conditions. The influences of different physical and chemical factors on 
fungichromin production in submerged cultures were investigated. Response surface 
methodology (RSM) was used to optimize medium composition for obtaining high 
fungichromin production. The result indicated that when the submerged culture operated at 
34 , with initial pH 7.8 and the glucose concentration of 13 g/l, soybean powder 13 g/l and ℃
CaCO3 0.45 g/l, the fungichromin concentration could reached 112 mg/l for 2 days. 
 
Keywords: Fungichromin; Streptomyces padanus PMS-702; Response surface methodology; 
antifungal substance  
 
 
Introduction 
 
Antibiotics produced by Actinomycetes, such as genus Streptomyces, have been used in 
agriculture and medicine during the past century. Due to the health and environment concerns, 
such as easily degraded and safety compared to chemical pesticides, natural antibiotics have 
shown the potential to replace some of the commonly used chemical pesticides. A antibiotic 
produced by Streptomyces padanus PMS-702 was purified and identified as the polyene 
macrolide, fungichromin, by NMR and mass spectral data[1-3]. It displayed effective 
antifungal activity in control of Rhizoctonia damping-off of cabbage and tomato late blight 
[4-6].  
Although there are many novel applications found on fungichromin, little effort is 
exerted regarding the effect of environmental factors on fungichromin production by 
Streptomyces in submerged cultures [7]. For obtaining a high fungichromin production from S. 
padanus PMS-702, various factors such as kinds and levels of carbon and nitrogen sources 
must be determined. RSM, an empirical design approach was carried out to evaluate the 
relations between the controlled experimental factors and the observed results. Initial pH 
value, cultural temperature, the concentrations of soybean powder, glucose and CaCO3 were 
 24
(with Water C18 Bondapak reverse phase column). The mobile phase was composed of 
methanol to water (60:40) with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The absorbance was measured at 
357nm by an UV detector (Jasco, UV-970, Japan). 
 
2.4. Experimental design 
 
First, a two-level fractional factorial design was employed to determine the path of 
steepest ascent (PSA) toward the neighborhood of the optimum process response. Then a 
second order experimental designs, the central composite design (CCD) may be employed to 
fully elucidate the response surface near the optimum and provide an approximation to the 
true response [8-12]. In this study, the RSM was used for the optimization of C-source 
concentration, N-source concentration, CaCO3 concentration, cultural temperature and initial 
pH value to yield the maximum fungichromin concentration from S. padanus PMS-702 . 
Concerning the interaction between the experimental factors, 25-1 partially fractional factorial 
design was applied. According to experimental data, a mathematical model related 
fungichromin concentration to C-source, N-source, and CaCO3 concentration, along with 
cultural temperature and initial pH value were established via multi regression, furthermore 
the optimal value was obtained. All of the experiments were designed and analyzed by the 
software “SAS”. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1. Batch flask culture 
 
Time courses of fungichromin, glucose concentration, mycelium dry weight and pH 
during the PMS-702 cultivation are shown in Fig. 1. These data were obtained with 100 ml of 
basal medium at initial pH 7, 28  and 100 rpm. The results indicated that fungichromin ℃
concentration reached 9.8mg/l at the 6th day and the mycelium concentration could reach its 
maximum of 2.3 g/l at the 2nd day. After the 2nd day, the mycelial growth became stationary. 
The glucose concentration was almost used up after day 3. 
 
 
3.2. Effect of carbon sources 
 
Carbohydrates, which play key roles as structural and storage compounds in cell, are 
distinguished as monosaccharide, disaccharide and polysaccharide. In order to find the 
optimal medium, different kinds of carbon sources, such as glucose, sucrose, starch, lactose, 
glycerol, and were added into the medium separately. The result shown in Fig. 2 revealed the 
 26
3.5. Path of steepest ascent 
 
In order to search the optimum cultivation conditions, PSA was employed. The above 
model is useful in indicating the direction in which to change variables to enhance 
fungichromin concentration (Y) the fastest. Based on Eq. (1), Five experiments were designed 
and shown in Table 3. The experimental compositions changed in a specific constant rate 
based on the coefficient of the X1, X2, X3, X4 and X5 in Eq. (1). The result showed that at trial 
2 the maximum fungichromin concentration (10.8 mg /100 ml) was obtained. It revealed that 
local optimum fungichromin concentration was at around trial 2 composition. 
 
3.6. Central composite design 
 
After having climbed up the response surface to regions of higher growth response, the 
sub-region of the response surface was explored in greater detail. A second experimental 
design was formulated whose center point was moved in the direction of the conditions giving 
the highest growth response on the steepest path. The experiment domain that was out of the 
initial domain should be rearranged to proceed in CCD (Table 4). It consisted of sixteen 
experiments organized in a 25-1 fractional factorial design. Second-order coefficients were 
assessed by adding ten star points (one factor being at level -2 or +2 and all others maintained 
at zero level) and five replications of the central point (all factors at zero level). A total of 31 
experiments were necessary for the estimation of the 10 coefficients of the model. Among 
them, No. 1–16 was a 25-1 partially fractional factorial design, No. 17–26 were star points, and 
No. 27-31 were central points (five central points), as shown in Table 5. The experiments of 
star points and central points could increase the confidence of model. Table 5 showed the 
levels of chosen independent variables for the experimental design and the fungichromin 
concentration under various parameter combinations after 2 days of fermentation. The 
statistical program was used for the regression analysis of the data obtained. The following 
equation, where the variables take their coded values, was obtained by the regression analysis. 
 
Y=10.68?2.25 X1??1.6 X4??3.17 X5?         (2) 
 
The statistical analysis suggested that X1, X4 and X5 term had a significant effect on 
fungichromin concentration. In other words, a small change of soybean powder, cultural 
temperature and initial pH value would cause a large variation in the response. Other variables 
showed slighter effects. When the mathematical model was differentiated, a local maximum 
was present. The maximum fungichromin concentration (110 mg/l) was achieved theoretically 
at soybean powder (X1) 1.1 g/100 ml, glucose (X2) 1.1 g/100 ml, CaCO3 (X3) 0.044g/100 ml, 
cultural temperature (X4) 31.7 and initial pH (X5) 5.6. To prove its feasibility, three
