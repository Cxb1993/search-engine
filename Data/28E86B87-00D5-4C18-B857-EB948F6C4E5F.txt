Fig 1.Skin color distribution and boundary box in CbCr 
color space in Ref [1]. 
Considering only color information, a pixel will be 
classified as skin if both of its color components are 
within each of these ranges. So, the technique used for 
the racial recognition and face segmentation consists of 
defining maximum and minimum thresholds for each 
of the two chromatic components. 
 
2.2 YCgCr color space 
     There is another useful color coordinate: YCgCr, a 
novel color space based on YCbCr, was mainly 
proposed in [1, 2] for face segmentation. It is based on 
YCbCr, but it differs on the use of the Cg color 
component instead of Cb. The color spaces used in 
television systems (YUV, YCbCr) are transmission 
oriented, so in order to minimize the encoding 
decoding errors, they use the biggest color differences: 
(R-Y) and (B-Y). The YCgCr color uses the smallest 
color difference (G-Y) instead of (B-Y). 
The YCgCr components can be obtained in a 
similar way than the YCbCr equations described in the 
ITU Rec. BT. 601 and expressed in terms of Y’, G’-Y’, 
R’-Y’ components defined in the [0,1] range using the 
following matrix expression: 
16 219 'Y Y= + ´ , 
' 0.299 ' 0.413 ' 0.144 'Y R G B= ´ + ´ - ´   ...Eq(1)

-
………Eq(2) 
1128 112 [ ( ' ')]
1 0.299
Cr R Y= + ´ -
-
……….Eq(3) 
 
Luminance and chrominance are coded in 8 bits. 
Y has an range of 219 and an offset of 16. The 
chromatic components are defined in the rage [16,240], 
with range of ± 112 and an offset of 128. Each 
component is coded in 8 bits. Expressed in matrix form, 
R’G’B’ components can be easily transformed to 
YCgCr components: 
 
16 0.257 0.504 0.098
128 0.316 0.439 0.121
128 0.439 0.368 0.071

…..Eq(4) 
 
According to [2], most skin pixel color 
distribution can be detected in the chrominance 
bounding box in CgCr domain shown in Fig 11. A 
pixel will be considered as skin if both of its color 
components are within each of the ranges defined by 
the maximum and minimum thresholds of the 
chrominance plane coordinates Cg and Cr. Where (Cg 
min, Cg max)=[76, 125] and (Cr min, Cr max)=[136, 
202]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig 2.Skin color distribution and boundary box in CgCr 
color space in Ref[2]. 
Consider the skin color distribution depicted in Fig 
2, it is possible to achieve a better performance of the 
face segmentation in the YCgCr color space by defining 
a boundary box in the direction of the line that connects 
the Red and Cyan colors, where most of the skin values 
are concentrated. 
     New decision thresholds constituting a 
nonrectangular region (the black region inside the 
boundary box shown in Fig 2) can be defined, so that 
the Cr thresholds are the same vertical limits of the 
boundary box, while the Cg thresholds, Cg min and Cg 
max lines, are parallel to the Red-Cyan line. Hence the 
Cr min and Cr max thresholds and the Cg min and Cg 
max lines, according to the following equations: 
min maxCr Cr Cr£ £ …………..…….Eq(5) 
(Cr min, Cr max)= [136, 202]. 
(305 ) min 1.38 max
1.38 1.38
Cr Cr Cr CrCg- + ´ -£ £ Eq(6) 
Instead of using two binary masks for face 
segmentation based on the Cg and Cr thresholds of the 
boundary box, in the case of a nonrectangular decision 
region, for every Cr value, a binary mask is used for 
each Cg min and Cg max pair of Cg thresholds. The 
final mask for face segmentation is obtained as the 
intersection of all the binary masks. 
 
2.3 The reasons of choosing YCgCr 
     The black cluster of Fig 1 and 2 represent the 
majority of human skin chrominance in different 
domains. Fig 1 displays human skin chrominance of 
CbCr and Fig2 represents that of CgCr. Compare Fig 1 
to Fig 2, the shape of black cluster of Fig 2 in CgCr 
domain is more regular than that of Fig 1. The human

Fig 5.Skin color distribution in YCg and Y Cr domain. 
In Fig 5, there are two figures which show the 
experiment result of distributions in Y-Cg and Y-Cr 
domain. They show that Negroid really has less 
brightness than Caucasian and Mongoloid. 
Furthermore, Mongoloid has the widest distribution of 
luminance; we will consider the effect of illumination 
in GMM analysis. 
3. GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL 
 
GMM (Gaussian mixture model) which is the 
extension of single model Gaussian probability function 
is a conventional method to analyze non-uniform 
distributed data and is among the most statistically 
mature methods for clustering (though they are also 
used intensively for density estimation. In this tutorial, 
we introduce the concept of clustering, and see how one 
form of clustering in which we assume that individual 
data points are generated by first choosing one of a set 
of multivariate Gaussians and then sampling from them 
can be a well-defined computational operation.  
Mixture models are a semi-parametric alternative 
to non-parametric histograms (which can also be used 
as densities) and provide greater flexibility and 
precision in modeling the underlying statistics of 
sample data. They are able to smooth over gaps 
resulting from sparse sample data and provide tighter 
constraints in assigning object membership to color-
space regions. Such precision is necessary to obtain the 
best results of optimum means, covariance and 
weighting possible from color-based pixel classification 
for qualitative segmentation requirements.  
We then see how to learn such a thing from data, 
and we discover that an optimization approach not used 
in any of the previous Andrew Tutorials can help 
considerably here. This optimization method is called 
Expectation Maximization (EM). We'll spend some 
time giving a few high level explanations and 
demonstrations of EM, which turns out to be valuable 
for many other algorithms beyond Gaussian Mixture 
Models. 
 1-D data for example in Fig 6, we can see that 2-3 
clusters occupy separate sub-space and the probability 
of mixture clusters reveals Gaussian like distribution. 
We can use EM algorithm to find out optimum mean, 
co variance and weighting value of each cluster. 2-D 
data for example in Fig 7 also can be estimated by EM 
algorithm.

We applied 3-components Gaussian mixture 
models to the cluster of each race, Fig 8 for example. 
Each component of Gaussian model has its optimum 
mean, covariance and weighting which are obtained by 
EM algorithm.

Thus using the Bayes formula we obtain the a 
posteriori probability of Cj, j=1, 2. It follows that the 
Bayes decision rule is then: 
              Choose C1 if ( 1 | ) ( 2 | )P C x P C x

required for making the decision. Thus the decision 
rule becomes:  
arg max ( | ) ( )
j
P x Cj P Cj
® .  
Intuitively, the decision machine will make fewer 
mistakes when using more observations vectors. Thus 
in practice, multiple observation vectors are used: X= 
xi, i=1…n. Assuming that the observation vectors are 
independent and identically distributed (iid), then the 
joint likelihood is:

       In practice, the true form of the pdf ( | )P X Cj  is 
unknown, hence a parametric representation,

       Due to precision issues in computational 
implementation, it is more convenient to use a 
summation rather than series of multiplications. Since

       Strictly speaking, the normalization factor 1/n is 
not necessary to make a decision. However, in practical 
situations variable length observations are often 
encountered. Since ( )xL  is observation length 
independent, it allows the approximation of the 
distributions of ( )xL  for true clients and known 
impostors, which in turn simplifies the selection of the 
threshold.

     For example, there are several false detections of 
Negroid in Set 1, one of these errors is show in Fig 20 
which is classified as Caucasian due to the higher 
illumination. Because the original picture of Negroid 
was taken during the daytime, the violent sunlight 
made the skin brighter than the average parameters of 
Negroid and Fig 9’s result of GMM analysis of Y 
domain is a deviation of Caucasian’s side. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig 9. The false detection of Negroid due to sunlight. 
 
 Here is another error detection shown in Fig 10 in 
Set 1. Fig 10 was classified as Mongoloid; the primary 
picture of Negroid was taken at night with the 
flashlights. The strong intensity of flashlights projected 
on the dark-brown skin color and made the skin color 
look like yellow- brown. The distribution of GMM 
analysis in YCgCr domain is a deviation of 
Mongoloid’s side. Consequently, the voting machine 
classified Fig 10 as Mongoloid. 
 
 
 
 
Fig 10. The false detection of Negroid due to flashlights. 
The false classifications usually occur when the 
violent illumination changes such as sunlight and 
flashlights or strong surrounding lighting condition. 
However, the illumination Y domain still has a great 
help for the classification with the testing images under 
normal lighting condition. 
5.1Conclusion and Future Work 
We proposed new automatic skin color detection of 
human races with Gaussian Mixture Model analysis on 
a novel color space, YCgCr. It has been applied on two 
training sets of many images of different races and 
lighting conditions for obtaining the Gaussian Mixture 
Model’s parameters of YCgCr. Its performances of 
different races have been tested with two sets of images 
which only include the region of nose with several 
different lighting conditions. 
The false detections only occur when the violent 
illumination changes such as sunlight and flashlights or 
strong surrounding lighting condition. However, the 
illumination Y domain still has a great help for the 
classification with the testing images under normal 
lighting condition. The performance of Negroid is the 
poorest among three races detections because the 
distribution of Negroid in CgCr domain is between 
Caucasian’s and Mongoloid’s distributions. 
This method of skin color detection on YCgCr 
domain with GMM analysis can be applied easily on 
the interface of robot machine and security monitor in 
the future. This method also can be applied on pre-
process of face recognition to help raise the accuracy of 
recognition.
