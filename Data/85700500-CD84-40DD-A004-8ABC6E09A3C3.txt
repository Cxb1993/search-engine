esterification reaction in the melt. Homopolyesters 
include PBSu, PESu, poly(propylene succinate) (PPSu), 
and poly(2-methyl-1,3-propylene succinate) (PMPSu). 
Novel copolyesters include PBMPSu 50/50, PBPSu 50/50, 
PEBSu 50/50, and PEPSu 50/50, etc. The chemical 
compositions and the sequence distribution in 
copolyesters were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The 
temperatures of initial thermal decomposition were 
determined using thermogravimetry and/or polarized 
light microscope (PLM) in an inert environment. 
Isothermal growth rates of spherulites were measured 
using PLM by isothermal and/or nonisothermal methods. 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and PLM were 
used to study the kinetics of isothermal and 
nonisothermal crystallization. The melting behavior 
of the specimens after isothermal and/or 
nonisothermal crystallization was investigated by DSC 
and temperature modulated DSC (TMDSC) at different 
heating rates. The reversing, total, and non-
reversing heat flow curves were analyzed. The crystal 
conformations at various temperatures were examined 
by wide-angle X-ray diffractometer and Fourier 
transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). This work has 
three topics. One is to examine the novel 
copolyesters, PEBSu 50/50 and PETSu 50/50, under 
various isothermal conditions. Second, mechanisms and 
kinetics of thermal degradation of PBS, PBMPSu 95/5 
and 90/10 were studied using TGA and FTIR. 
Additionally, the melting behavior of PBPSu and 
PBCHDMSu following the nonisothermal crystallization 
was examined. Third, Lipase was used to biodegrade 
PBS-riched copolyesters. For example, poly(butylene 
succinate-co-1,3-propylene succinate) (PBPSu) 80/20 
before and/or after biodegradetion were investigated 
using GPC, 1H NMR, DSC and SEM.

Nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of novel biodegradable
poly(butylene succinate-co-2-methyl-1,3-propylene succinate)s

Abstract Two novel poly(butylene succinate-co-2-methyl-
1,3-propylene succinate)s, PBMPSu 95/5 and PBMPSu 90/
10, were characterized as having 6.5 and 10.8 mol% 2-
methyl-1,3-propylene succinate (MS) units, respectively, by
1H NMR. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a
polarized light microscope (PLM) employed to investigate
the nonisothermal crystallization of these copolyesters and
poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu). Morphology and the
isothermal growth rates of spherulites under PLM experi-
ments at three cooling rates of 1, 2.5 and 5 °C/min were
monitored and obtained by curve-fitting. These continuous
rate data were analyzed with the Lauritzen-Hoffman
equation. A transition of regime II→III was found at 96.2,
83.5, and 77.9 °C for PBSu, PBMPSu 95/05, and PBMPSu
90/10, respectively. DSC exothermic curves at five cooling
rates of 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 °C/min show that almost all of
the nonisothermal crystallization occurred in regime III.
DSC data were analyzed using modified Avrami, Ozawa,
Mo, Friedman and Vyazovkin equations. All the results of
PLM and DSC measurements reveal that incorporation of
minor MS units into PBSu markedly inhibits the crystalli-
zation of the resulting polymer.

Introduction
In recent years, the use in a large amount of the chemosyn-
thetic polymers has caused a global environmental problem
because these polymers are difficult to be decomposed.
Biodegradable polymers which can be degraded to CH4,
CO2 and H2O by enzymes or microorganisms have received
much attention as ecological materials [1]. Aliphatic poly-
esters have been a good choice among many biodegradable
polymers. Poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu) which is a
chemosynthetic aliphatic polyester has relatively high melt-
ing point and comparable mechanical properties with those
of widely used polymers such as low-density polyethylene
(LDPE) and poly(propylene) [2]. Because it can be
processed using conventional equipments, it becomes the
hopeful substitute for LDPE.
Fundamentally, the characterization for the enzymatic
degradation of polyester films demonstrated that the degree of
crystallinity, morphology and crystal structure play an impor-
tant role in the mechanical properties and biodegradability of
polymers [3]. In many literatures, the crystalline structure,
crystallization and melting behavior of neat PBSu [4–15] have
been investigated extensively. PBSu has a relatively low
biodegradation rate because of its high crystallization rate and
high crystallinity. To improve the biodegradability of PBSu,
physical blending and copolymerization have often been
adopted. About copolymers, the degradation rates of PBSu
can be increased by incorporating minor amounts of diols or
diacids [10, 16, 17] because of the reduced crystallinity.
Poly(propylene succinate) (PPSu) derived from 1,3-
propanediol with an odd number of carbon atoms in the
backbone has gained increasing attention, because it has a
higher biodegradation rate than that with two or four carbon
atoms in the diol monomer [18–20]. Poly(butylene
succinate-co-propylene succinate) (PBPSu) copolymers

ABSTRACT: Poly(2-methyl-1,3-propylene succinate) (PMPSu), poly(butylene 
succinate) (PBSu), and their two novel copolyesters poly(butylene succinate-co-2- 
methyl-1,3-propylene succinate)s (PBMPSu) were used in this study. To evaluate the 
thermal stability of these polyesters, TGAFTIR experiments were performed from 
30 to 800C at 5C/min under nitrogen. To investigate the pyrolysates quantitatively, 
PBSu and PMPSu were pyrolyzed at 395 and 450C, respectively, for 0.2 min under 
helium, and analyzed online using a GCMS system. The results suggest -hydrogen 
bond scission requires higher energy compared to -hydrogen bond scission. Two 
different thermal degradation mechanisms are proposed for these polyesters. PBSu is 
proposed to degrade only through -hydrogen bond scission. The thermal 
decomposition of PMPSu undergoes, mainly, through -hydrogen bond scission and 
minor through -hydrogen bond scission. PBSu-riched PBMPSu copolyesters 
degrade first via the -hydrogen bond scission mechanism and then follow the 
-hydrogen bond scission mechanism.

INTRODUCTION 
Scientists and engineers are considering solving problems of 
waste management by replacing bio-resistant synthetic polymers with 
biodegradable polymers. Besides the biodegradability, the thermal 
stability and thermal degradation behavior of biodegradable polymers 
are important for their processing, application, and thermal recycling. 
However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study has 
addressed on the thermal stability of poly(butylene succinate-co-
propylene succinate) (PBPSu) copolymers. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials and specimen preparation.  Poly(butylene succinate) 
(PBSu), PBPSu 95/5, and PBPSu 90/10 were synthesized using a two-
step esterification reaction in the melt state. The authors’ recent 
studies have provided details of the synthesis and characterization.

Table 1 summarizes their properties. All of the polyester sheets were 
prepared by compression molding for 5 min at 115ºC, and then allowed 
to cool slowly to room temperature. Compressed sheets with a 
thickness of around 0.2 mm were thus formed, and then dried in vacuo 
overnight at room temperature before use.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).  Thermal stability experi-
ments were performed using a TA 2050 TGA. The sample (10 ± 1.0 
mg) was placed in a platinum crucible, and was heated from 30 to 
800C in a 50 ml/min flow of nitrogen. Heating rates of 1, 3, 5, and 
10C/min were used. Percent of original sample mass was recorded 
throughout the heating process, and then the first derivative of the 
mass curve was obtained. These thermal curves were analyzed 
according to ASTM E 1641. 
Measurements of TGAFTIR.  The sheet specimen was heated 
from 30 to 800ºC at 5ºC/min. Gases that were evolved from TGA were 
sent to a FTIR spectrometer through a heated line. This transfer line 
and the gas measurement cell were maintained at 225ºC. FTIR spectra 
were obtained using a BIO-RAD FTS3000MX spectrometer at a reso-
lution of 4 cm
1
, with an accumulation of 32 scans. 
 
RESULTS 
FTIR spectra changes during thermal degradation Figure 1 
plots the mass percentages retained and the derivatives of the mass 
(DTG) traces as a function of temperature for PBSu (solid curves), 
PBPSu 95/5 (dashed curves) and PBPSu 90/10 (dotted curves) in 
flowing nitrogen at a heating rate of 5 ºC/min. The rate of mass loss 
slowly increased to a maximum at ~390ºC, which was determined from 
the DTG curves. After deconvolution of the DTG curves, two stages of 
mass loss were evident. Figure 2 presents the online FTIR spectrum 
obtained from the gas products that evolved at the temperature at 
which the decomposition of PBPSu 90/10 was the fastest. It reveals 
several main absorptions which are enumerated from 1 to 10 in order 
of decreasing band area. Table 2 presents the assignments of the 
FTIR bands to the vibration modes of the functional groups.
