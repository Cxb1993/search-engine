Of particular important is the size and shape of the cavity relative to the cation size. When 
the ion able to fit within the cavity, the crown ether-metal ion complex are form in a 1:1 ratio. 
If the ion is large than that of the crown cavity and there is lower affinity in crown ether and 
metal ion, there is tendency for crown ether moieties to “sandwich” the metal ion between 
adjacent crown units. Introduction of crown ether into polyfluorene has not been reported so 
far. 
Electroluminescent (EL) polymers have attracted considerable attention among 
scientists due to their potential applications as emitting layer in flat-panel displays. The great 
advantages of polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) are tunable emission color through 
molecular design and solution-processabile by appropriate derivation, which are suitable for 
large-area-display devices by spin-coating or printing methods. The most extensively studied 
EL polymers are the linear conjugated ones, such as poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV),12 
polyfluorene (PF)13 and their derivatives.14 Under an external electric field electrons are 
injected from the cathode into the π*-band (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO) of 
the conjugated polymer and the holes are injected from the anode to the π-band (highest 
occupied molecular orbital, HOMO). For monolayer EL device, the energy differences 
between work functions of cathode or anode and LUMO or HOMO of the conjugated 
polymers, respectively, are the unavoidable energy barrier for electron or holes injection. In 
order to achieve more efficient light emission, reducing barrier height of polymer/metal 
interface and balancing charges injection are of currently challenged issue. There are two 
options to solve the problem:15 one could use low work function metals as cathode,16,17 or 
introduce electron transporting/injection materials between emitting layer and cathode to 
reduce barrier height. However, low work-function metals are usually reactive and unstable 
upon exposure to air that makes device encapsulation a necessary. Considering the stability 
of device, employing electron transporting or injection materials is a more practical option.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Synthesis and Characterization of Monomer and Polymers. New monomer (M1) 
containing crown ether moiety was synthesized from trithyleneglycol ditosylate (1) and  
dihydroxy fluorene monomer (4) under high dilute solution, in which 4 was prepared from 
2,7-dibromofluorene via several steps as shown in Scheme 1. The structure of M1 was 
satisfactorily characterized by 1H NMR spectra and elemental analysis. Polyfluorene 
containing pendant crown ether groups (PC) was successfully synthesized from M1 and 
 10
emission maxima locate at 419 and 418 nm, respectively, under photo excitation with 380 nm 
light. In film state, the absorption peaks blue-shift slightly to 381 and 376 nm, while the 
emission maxima shift bathochromically to 430 and 423 nm. It is noteworthy that the PL 
spectral red-shift of PC (11 nm) in going from solution to film state is larger than that of PF 
(5 nm). In addition, the intensity of broad band at 500-600 nm is also greater for PC, 
suggesting formation aggregate and/or excimer in solid state which is facilitated by the polar 
crown ether groups. Strong intermolecular interaction caused by polar crown ether groups is 
an intrinsic driver for aggregate and excimer formation. 
It is well known that thermal annealing of polyfluorene usually leads to formation of 
inter-chain interaction (excimers) and/or ketonic defects.34 And a new green emission around 
500 ~ 600 nm grows in intensity with annealing time if the conditions are proper.35-38 Figure 
4 shows the normalized PL emission spectra of PC films during annealing at 140°C under 
nitrogen atmosphere. A green-emission peaked at ca. 521 nm appears and its intensity 
increases gradually with annealing time. However, the green emission is negligible for 
polyfluorene under the same annealing condition. Because the annealing is under nitrogen 
atmosphere, formation of ketone due to oxidation can be rule out. Moreover, there is no 
significant change observed in absorption spectra during the thermal annealing. Accordingly, 
the longer wavelength band is mainly contributed by the excimer formed during the 
annealing. Incorporated crown ether enhances the inter-chain interaction due to its polar 
characteristic that leads to form excimer easily. However, PC still shows outstanding device 
performance when fabricated as PLED devices and the details will be discussed later. 
Fluorescence response to metal ions. Fluorescence is a widely used to investigate chemical 
sensing. This method offered diverse transduction schemes based upon change in intensity, 
energy transfer, wavelength shifting and lifetime decay or flourish. Incorporation of crown 
ether receptor to the conjugated polymer backbone provided the opportunity to obtain 
 12
positive proportion to sensitivity, F0 and F are the fluorescence intensity in the absence and 
presence of quencher.  
(F0/F) = 1 + Ksv[Q]  or  Ksv = {(F0/F) – 1}/[Q]                   (Eq.1) 
PC showed selective and sensitive fluorescence signal response toward Fe3+ and Ru3+ in 
which fluorescence was quenched with an increase of concentration of Ru3+ (Figure 7) 
following the Stern-Volmer equation. The PC fluorescence intensity was quenched over 70% 
when 14 pmm Ru3+ was presented and the fluorescence quenching could be detected while 
Ru3+ concentration as low as 1 ppm which shows intrinsic high sensitivity of conjugated 
chemosensory polymer. The Stern-Volmer plots for Ru3+ and Fe3+ showed clear upward 
curvature (Figure 8), suggesting that the quenching is attributed to the sphere-of-action 
mechanism.39-41 As increase the concentration of quencher will decrease the distance between 
polymer and quencher. These closely space polymer-quencher pairs was increase the 
possibility of contact and was immediately quenched at moment of polymer be excited thus 
quenched PL intensity more efficient. The high Stern-Volmer constants of 1.1×104  and 
1.1×103 M-1 were also estimated for Ru3+ and Fe3+ at low concentrations of quencher (below 
10-4 M of quencher). Pei, et al. demonstrated that conjugated polymer show 10-fold higher 
value of Stern-Volmer constant than small molecular due to facile energy migration along the 
polymer backbone resulting enhancement of sensitivity. According to Stern-Volmer constant, 
PC shows higher sensitivity toward Ru3+ than Fe3+.  
Solvent effect on sensitivity. Swager et al. provided a new concept to enhance sensitivity by 
aggregated polymer in which enhanced exciton migration properties within polymer chain 
result increasing the probability of exciton to find a specific sit, which bound quenching 
analyte in conjugated polymer. 42,43 We chose MeOH/CHCl3 co-solvent system to test the 
conjugated chemosensory sensor PC. For MeOH, it is a poor solvent, which polymer is fold 
up or aggregated, and CHCl3 is good solvent in which polymer chain is expanded and in 
 14
electrochemical data are summarized in Table 3. The onset oxidation potentials of PC and PF 
are observed at 1.33 V and 1.42 V, respectively, whereas the reduction potentials are situated 
at -1.7 V and -1.6 V. Clearly PC possesses lower oxidation potential and higher reduction 
potential, which is also attributable to the pendant crown ether groups. However, the band 
gaps of PC and PF are comparable (3.02 ~ 3.03 eV) because of the same conjugated 
polyfluorene backbone structure.  
The energy band diagram of PC and PF are proposed as Figure 13. The highest 
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) 
levels were estimated by using the equations EHOMO = -(Eox + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = -(Ere + 4.8) 
eV, where Eox and Ered are the onset reduction and oxidation potentials relative to the 
ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PC are -5.68 and 
-2.65 eV, respectively, and those of PF are -5.77 and -2.75 eV. The difference between energy 
barriers for hole and electron injection ( E△ H - E△ e) is an index of charges injection balance, 
the lower ( E△ H - E△ e) value the more balanced charge injection. The values of ( E△ H - E△ e) 
for PC and PF are 0.23 and 0.42, respectively, indicating that PC should lead to more 
balanced charges injection and better device performance when fabricated as EL device.  
Electroluminescent Properties of LED Devices. Double-layer electroluminescent devices, 
with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Ca (50 nm)/Al (100 nm), using PC and 
PF as emitting materials were fabricated to investigate their optoelectronic characteristics. 
The PC and PF films were fabricated by spin-coating from their solution in chlorobenzene 
(20 mg/ml). Figure 14 shows the normalized EL spectra of PC and PF device. For PF device, 
there are three major emission peaks located at 423, 448 and 479 nm, which are 
corresponding to S10→S00, S10→S01 and S10→S02 vibronic transitions, respectively.28 
However, the PC device not only shows the intrinsic emissions of polyfluorene but also an 
additional intense peak at 522 nm and a shoulder at 570 nm. In order to elucidate its origin, 
 16
fabrication of the device, a dilute PC solution (5 mg PC/ 1 ml toluene, 2000 rpm) was coated 
on top of the emitting PF layer. Figure 17 show the luminance and current density versus 
bias for the PC-coated (triple-layer) and pristine PF device (double-layer) and their relative 
characteristic data are summarized in Table 4. The turn-on voltage of triple-layer device (4.1 
V) is much lower than those of PF and PC devices (6.6 V, 7.1 V). Moreover, maximum 
luminance and maximum luminance efficiency (2800 cd/m2, 0.53 cd/A) are superior to those 
of PF device (860 cd/m2, 0.29 cd/A). However, the CIE chromaticity coordinate (0.19, 0.13) 
is very close to (0.17, 0.12) of PF device. This result means that emitting light is contributed 
mainly from PF layer. Significant performance enhancement in PC device strongly suggests 
that energy barrier for electron injection is substantially lowered by the insertion of the PC. 
Current results indicate that attaching crown ether groups to polyfluorene is a promising 
modification strategy to promote electron injection and device performance.    
CONCLUSIONS 
We have successfully synthesized a novel multiple function of copolyfluorene PC 
containing pendant crown ether groups by the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction 
and applied in both of biological and optoelectronic area. Introduction of crown ether 
pending on the side chain of PC resulted in high glass-transition temperature up to 130℃, 
low degradation temperature and chare yield comparing to model polymer PF. In sensing 
discussion, PC exhibited high sensitivity, detection limited as low as 1 ppm, and good 
selectivity toward Ruthenium ion due to the similar size of ion to the cavity size of crown 
ether. Conformation and shape of crown ether governed the sensitive and selectivity of 
chemosensors. PC was not only a good chemosensory polymer but also a good light-emitting 
polymer and electro injection layer. In film state, the PL spectra of PC (430 nm and 452 nm) 
show obvious red-shift comparing with homo-polyfluorene (PF). After thermal annealing at 
140 ℃ for 70 min, a new intense emission appears at ca. 520 nm which has been ascribed to
