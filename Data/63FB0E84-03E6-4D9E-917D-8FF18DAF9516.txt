1. 前言 
 
This report presents an approach for locating static sensor nodes randomly deployed in a two-dimensional 
coordinate system by means of mobile anchor nodes equipped with directional antennas [1]. In the proposed 
approach, each anchor node determines its current location using GPS or some other form of localization 
scheme and then broadcasts this information in the form of a beacon message via four fixed directional 
antennas as it moves through the sensing field. Utilizing a simple mathematical processing scheme, each 
sensor node computes its own coordinates based on the position information received from the mobile anchors. 
To the best of our knowledge, the proposed protocol presented in this study represents the first attempt in the 
literature to utilize mobile anchors with directional antennas for localization purposes in WSNs. The 
performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated numerically using an extension of the ns-2 simulator [2,3] 
known as TeNs [4]. The results show that the proposed scheme enables the positions of the sensor nodes to be 
determined with a great degree of accuracy. 
 
2. 研究目的 
 
Recent advancements in the wireless communications and hardware technology field have facilitated the 
development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for a wide variety of real-world applications, including 
environmental monitoring, disaster relief, site security, medical diagnostics, battlefield surveillance, and so on 
[5]. In such networks, the locations of the individual sensors are required to be accurately known. The global 
positioning system (GPS) is one of the most well known and widely used localization techniques. However, 
fitting every sensor in a large-scale WSN with a GPS receiver is prohibitively expensive, and thus many more 
cost-effective localization mechanisms have been proposed. For example, with the time of arrival (TOA), time 
difference of arrival (TDOA), angle of arrival (AOA), and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) methods, 
the node positions are determined by range-based schemes in accordance with distance or angle information 
[6]–[8]. These types of localization methods provide a reasonably high level of accuracy, but require each 
sensor node to be equipped with additional hardware for ranging purposes, and therefore increase the system 
cost. Conversely, range-free schemes provide a coarser positioning accuracy, but avoid the requirement for 
specific hardware support [9]–[11]. Whilst most localization mechanisms generally use fixed anchor nodes, 
several proposals have been presented for reducing the anchor deployment cost by utilizing mobile anchor 
nodes which navigate the sensing field in accordance with prescribed mobility models and issue beacon 
messages advertising their current coordinates [12]–[18].

3.1 Directional Antenna-based Schemes 
 
In [19], [20], a localized scheme was proposed in which a set of fixed anchor nodes, each equipped with a 
nodes are equipped with a switched antenna system [23] comprising four directional antennas, each with a 
beam width of θ. In configuring the antenna system, two of the antennas are orientated such that they are 
parallel to the horizontal axis (i.e. the x-axis), while the other two antennas are positioned such that they are 
parallel to the vertical axis (i.e. the y-axis). For convenience, the beams are numbered from 1 to 4 starting 
from the beam which radiates in the 3’o clock direction. An assumption is made that the anchor nodes radiate 
their current coordinates periodically as they move through the sensing field and have sufficient energy to 
both move and transmit simultaneously during the localization process. Finally, each sensor node is assumed 
to be equipped with an omni-directional antenna and utilizes a simple processing scheme to derive its position 
in the WSN based upon the coordinate information received from the mobile anchor nodes.

4.2 Location Estimation 
 
Assume that the WSN contains S = { |i = 1, . . . , n} sensor nodes and A = {  |j = 1, . . . , m} anchor 
nodes, where 0  m  n. Furthermore, assume that the directional antenna system of each anchor node  
includes D = { |j =1, . . . , m, k = 1, . . . , 4} antennas, each with a beam width of θ. Each anchor node 
transmits beacon messages sequentially from its D antennas as it moves through the sensing field. The beacon 
messages have the form (coordinate, flag), where the coordinate field contains the anchor node’s abscissa (i.e. 
x-coordinate) or ordinate (i.e. y-coordinate) value and the flag field contains a Boolean value indicating 
whether the coordinate field contains the x- or y-coordinate of the anchor node’s position. Specifically, a flag 
value of “true” indicates that the coordinate field contains the x-coordinate, while a value of “false” indicates 
that the coordinate field contains the y-coordinate. In configuring the directional antenna system, the flag field 
is set by default to “true” for beams  and  and to “false” for beams  and . Each sensor node

5.1.2 Metric 
 
As described in the following, the performance of the proposed localization mechanism was evaluated 
using the metric, namely the localization error. 
 
where n is the number of sensor nodes, ( , ) are the estimated coordinates of the i-th sensor node, and ( , 
) are the actual coordinates of the i-th sensor node. 
 
5.2. Simulation Results 
 
Fig. 2 illustrates the variation of the localization error as a function of the number of referenced beacon 
messages. It is evident that the precision of the proposed scheme is relatively insensitive to the number of 
beacon messages broadcast by the anchor nodes. Overall, the results suggest that a value of N = 1 represents 
the optimal setting for the proposed scheme. Note that the remaining simulations therefore adopt this value as 
a default setting. Fig. 3 shows the variation of the proposed scheme localization error as the beam width is 
increased incrementally from 1 to 5 degrees. It shows that the localization error of the proposed scheme 
reduces as the beam width of the directional antennas reduces. Fig. 4 depicts the variation of the localization 
error as the beacon interval is slowed down from 0.1 to 0.9 sec. The localization error of the proposed scheme 
is insensitive to the beacon interval.
