一、中文摘要
研究零維系統的量子能態的主要方法是
光學特性量測，光學方法的重要性在於它們在
量子點的光電元件應用；可是，在僅使用一種
載子的元件中(如量子點紅外線偵測器)，因為
在量子點(quantum dot, QDs)中的載子-載子交
互作用，量子點的特性與光學量測並不相同；
要研究僅有電子或電洞的量子點性質，我們轉
而使用電性量測的方法；在此為期一年的計畫
中，我們使用包含量子點之 Schottky二極體進
行電容-電壓分析，基於負微分電阻的觀察所
建立的模型，我們進行了 InAs/GaAs量子點之
溫度及頻率相關的捕捉/逃脫特性研究；藉由
變頻變溫量測與我們所建立的物理模型，發現
量子點的載子充放電時間約在微秒(ms)等級。
I. Abstract
The frequency dependence of negative
differential capacitance (NDC) in Schottky
diodes with InAs quantum dots (QDs) is studied.
The measured peak capacitances of NDC decay
rapidly as the testing frequencies are higher than
a few kHz. A kinetic model considering the
testing signal is proposed and the capture rates of
QDs are extracted. The simulation result is
quantitatively consistent with the experimental
data when the charging effect in QDs is included.
二、計畫緣由與目的 (II. Motivation and goal)
In these years the investigation of structures
with self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) draws
the increasing attention of researchers because of
their potential application on nano-electronics.
Researchers usually use optical methods to study
the physical properties of QDs [1,2], but
electrical characterization like capacitance
measurement is also essential for various
potential applications. Recently, the charge
accumulation in the QDs revealed specific
features in capacitance-voltage (C-V)
dependences [3-9]. Most of these reports
presented the experimental results of the C-V
dependences and the parameters of QDs, such as
concentration, energy levels and capture
cross-sections were determined accordingly.
Models for calculating the capacitance
dependence were also proposed to compare with
the experimental results. More interestingly, the
negative differential capacitance (NDC)
characteristic was observed at low temperatures
[9]. The NDC behavior was confirmed in our
previous work and a model considering charge
distribution in the device was also proposed [10].
The simulation results showed that the NDC is
caused by the fast charging-discharging process
in the states of QDs. It is not difficult to guess
that the NDC behavior would strongly depend on
the period of capacitance testing signal,
particularly when the period is comparable with
the charging-discharging time. In this report, the
frequency dependence of C-V characteristics is
investigated. A small signal model is also
derived to explain the experimental results.
三、研究方法及成果 (III. Method and result)
The sample was grown on n+-GaAs (100)
substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
using a Varian GEN II system equipped with an
arsenic cracker cell. The detailed structure can be
found in our previous letter [10]. Briefly, the
sample (LM3654) contains 5 layers InAs QDs
embedded in GaAs matrix. The spacer between
QDs layers is 80nm lightly-doped
(ND=6.4x1015cm-3) GaAs. The InAs QDs were
grown at about 485oC with the InAs growth rate
of 0.05ML/s and the arsenic (As4)
beam-equivalent-pressure (BEP) of 3x10-5torr.
The area density of the QDs was about
1x1011cm-2 by using the atomic force microscope
(AFM) measurement. Low temperature
photoluminescence showed that the ground state
transition energy was 1.23eV with
full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of 74meV.
4concentration (ND=6.4x1015cm-3), the dielectric
constant of GaAs (13.1) and the distance
between the layer of QDs and the Schottky
contact (L = 8x10-6cm), respectively. The
electron concentration in QDs nd and the
depletion width w can be calculated by the
following equations.

where dN and E1 are the area density
( dN =1x10
11cm-2) and the QDs’ground-state
energy below GaAs conduction-band edge,
respectively. When the testing sinusoidal signal
of capacitance is applied to the Schottky contact,
we have the time-dependent voltage:
)2sin()( 000 ftvVtvVV  (4)
where the )(tv is the testing signal and f is its
frequency. The depletion width w and the
electron concentration in QD nd become
time-dependent in the presence of the testing
signal. Our task is to find out the current
flow )(tI responsible for the time-varying nd and
w.

The first term accounts for the
charging/discharging of QDs. The second one
comes from the depletion width variation and
can be evaluated with the eq.(1), provided with
that the amplitude of testing signal is much
smaller than the DC bias voltage ( 00 vV  ).

where the )(tvd is the time-varying voltage at
QDs depth L. The only unknown factor to get the
current )(tI in the eq.(5) is )(tnd now because
the )(tw can be calculated by the eq.(6). To
obtain the )(tnd , we have to consider the
kinetic process of carrier capture/escape in QDs
as follows.

The n , nv , )(tn and en are the capture cross
section area of QDs, the thermal velocity of
electron in the conduction band, the electron
concentration near QDs in the conduction band
and the emission rate of electron from QDs,
respectively [5, 11]. The number of electrons in
QDs is the time-dependent )(tnd . The emission
rate can be easily estimated in view of that,
without the testing signal, the

The eq.(7) can be turned into the form, by using
)()( 0 tnntn ddd  , )()( 0 tnntn  and by
ignoring the higher order terms,

the )(tvd by the eq.(6), we can solve the )(tnd
in terms of )(tv with the assumption of

The usefulness of the eq.(10) comes from that
