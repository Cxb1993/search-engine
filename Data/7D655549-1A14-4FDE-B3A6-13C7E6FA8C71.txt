 1. 前言 
在傳統的鑽削加工的過程中，鑽頭因摩擦產生高
溫，易造成刀具的鈍化，使刀具的壽命大大的縮短。
加工中材料易發生切屑黏附的情形及材料在加工過
程產生的硬化現象，都會使刀具壽命大幅度的縮短，
並且影響到加工孔的表面精度與品質。另一方面，傳
統的鑽孔加工往往會使用大量的切削液來降低鑽削
區的加工溫度，易對環境造成污染，而且長時間的加
工，刀具容易鈍化，使加工表面粗糙，這些都是傳統
鑽孔加工所遇到極待克服的問題。 
因此，不斷地研發新式的鑽削刀具，就是為了滿
足鑽孔加工的需求，而刀具容易鈍化、加工孔表面粗

以及鑽孔加工孔的品質[1]。以鑽孔加工而言，摩擦鑽
孔的過程是屬於高溫加工，它可以解決難加工材料加
工面臨的問題。再則以環保角度而言，此加工法屬於
乾式切削，不會使用大量的切削液，不會造成環境上

 2. 基本原理 
2.1 摩擦鑽孔加工製程 
在熱摩擦鑽孔的加工過程中，鑽頭以高軸向壓力
與高速旋轉方式進入工件表面，摩擦鑽頭與工件之間
的溫度高達 650-750°C，工件緊鄰加工區域的溫度也
會瞬間提高，使得材料軟化，此時摩擦鑽就可以藉由
軸向力的作用，順利進入工件並完成加工。圖二為摩

Abstract.The main purpose of this research is to study the optimal machining parameters for a 
novel process of thermal friction drilling on SUS 304 stainless steel. The experiments were 
conducted according to an L9 orthogonal array based on Taguchi experimental designs method, and 
the multiple performance characteristics correlated with surface roughness (SR) and bush length 
(BL) was investigated by grey relational analysis systematically and comprehensively. Moreover, 
the significant machining parameters that most intensively affected the multiple performance  
characteristic and the optimal combination levels of machining parameters associated with the 
thermal friction drilling on SUS 304 stainless steel were determined through the analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) and the response graph of grey relational grade. The main machining 
parameters of the thermal friction drilling such as friction angle, friction contact area ratio, feed rate, 
and drilling speed were selected to evaluate the effects on SR and BL. The experimental results 
show that the thermal friction drilling revealed beneficial effects on SR and BL for drilling 
processes. Moreover, the optimal machining parameters for multiple performance characteristics 
associated with SR and BL were attained. The developed thermal friction drilling avoids serious 
tool wears, enhances the surface quality of the machined hole, and prolongs the tool life 
significantly. 
Introduction 
Drilling plays a very important role in machining since more than 40% of material removal 
processes are associated with this type of operation [1]. Traditionally, a drilling tool was commonly 
made of high speed steel (HSS). The traditional drilling process causes the drill easy to dull and 
leads to a shortened service life, because a high temperature is produced during drilling process. 
Moreover, the workpiece materials were easy to harden during traditional drilling process, which

without significant radial fracture. Miller et al. [13] applied friction drilling to machine low-carbon 
steels, aluminum alloys, and magnesium alloys to explore the relationships between axial thrust 
force and torque under different spindle speeds and feed rates. Lee et al. [14] had successfully 
applied friction drilling to IN-713LC for machining cast superalloy to assess the roundness, the 
surface roughness, and the hardness of machined-hole-wall. Chow et al. [15] conducted the 
experiments to explore the optimal geometric shape and friction contact area ratio of the friction 
drill on AISI304 stainless steel. Lee et al. [16] utilized tungsten carbide drills to investigate the 
benefits of coating on machining AISI 304 stainless steel, the experimental results showed that the 
coated drills revealed less tool wear than uncoated ones. The above related papers did not explore 
the optimal parameters combination for friction drilling process nor discuss the important issues 
such as the geometric shape of the drills and cutting parameters affecting on surface roughness and 
bushing length, etc. 
The thermal friction drilling can be applied in various malleable metals including mild steel, 
stainless steel, cooper, brass and aluminum to generate precision holes with bushing. The bushing 
can serve as a sleeve bearing, a location for a brazed connection, or tapping to give deep screw 
threads. Figure 1 demonstrates the typical applications of the thermal drilling. Friction drilled parts 
can be used in domestic (electric) appliances and bike skeleton, etc. 
Grey theory has been widely used in the applications of engineering analysis, and its reveals the 
potential of solving the optimizing machining parameters for a process with multiple performance 
characteristics [17-25]. Therefore, using grey relational analysis will facilitate the development of a 
novel process to fit the demands of industrial applications.  
Due to the excellent properties and the applications of industrial development, stainless steel 
material has been adopted broadly and possesses the outstanding features of high toughness, low 
thermal conductivity, and high work-harkening coefficient. These features not only extend its 
applications in modern industries, but also induce great problems in drilling process. Moreover, the 
thermal friction drilling process presented the potentials of drilling a hole with excellent efficiency, 
high surface quality, and green benefit without environment impact. It also shows a less limitation 
of hole size for the drilling processes. However, there are only few researches conducted on the 
relationships between process parameters and machining characteristics for the thermal friction 
drilling. Therefore, the novel process of the thermal friction drilling needs a further and 
comprehensive study to understand the effects of drilling parameters on machining performance.  
The main purpose of this paper is to explore the optimization of machining parameters of the 
thermal friction drilling process on austenite stainless steel (SUS 304). Moreover, an L9 orthogonal 
array based on the Taguchi method was adopted to design the experiments, and the experimental 
data were statistically investigated by the grey relational analysis approach for multiple 
performance characteristics associated with surface roughness (SR) and bushing length (BL). The 
significant process parameters affected the grey relational grade obtained from grey theory were 
determined, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and optimal combination levels of machining 
parameters were explored. Thus, the multiple performance characteristics of the thermal friction 
drilling process on difficult-to-machine materials such as stainless steel would be improved to fit

Grey relational generating 
Grey relational analysis adopted discrete measurements to evaluate the distance between two 
sequences and then explored the extent of their relationships. The sequences must have some 
aspects such as comparative, invariant scaling, and polarization, when they are assigned to conduct 
the grey relational analysis. In general, if the sequence range is excessively large or the standard 
value is too enormous, it will induce the effect of some factors to be ignored [26]. Moreover, when 
the goals and directions of the sequence are different, the relational analysis could also draw 
improper results. In grey relational analysis, the original data were transferred (normalized) into the 
range between zero and one. This procedure is also called the grey relational generating. According 
to the performance characteristics, the sequences can be categorized to three types.

Experimental conditions 
The effects of machining parameters on machining characteristics were extensively investigated 
in this study. Moreover, the significant parameters and the optimal combination levels of machining 
parameters were determined. The main machining parameters: friction angle (FA), friction contact 
area ratio (FCAR), feed rate (FR), and spindle speed (SS), were varied to determine their effects on 
SR and BL. The grey relational analysis was calculated the grey relational grade from the 
experimental observed values. The significant machining parameters that affected the grey 
relational grade associated with SR and BL were also manipulated by ANOVA. In addition, the 
optimal combination levels of the machining parameters that would obtain the highest grey 
relational grade were attained from response graph of grey relational grade. 
Results and discussion 
The features of thermal friction drilling process 
The features of the thermal friction drill were determined by a comparison investigation. In this 
study 2 mm SUS 304 stainless steel plate was used as workpiece material and the drilling 
conditions were set 1200 rpm drilling speed and 100 mm/min feed rate (referred to SANDVIK tool 
handbook). Then, two different WC drills such as traditional twist drill and thermal friction drill 
with conical shape were used. The results showed that twist drill would form a serious dull edge 
after three runs (see Figure 5). However, the thermal friction drill could machine the SUS 304 
stainless steel over 60 runs with only a slight wear (see Figure 6). The thermal friction drill kept the 
capability for further drilling operation, and the surface integrity of machined hole obtained by 
thermal friction drill was smoother than that obtained by twist drill. In summary, traditional WC 
twist drills with thin drill edges might not be able to provide the high toughness and high strength 
for drilling the stainless steel, and it is also unable to withstand the high temperature caused by a 
high speed drilling. Therefore, the traditional WC drills would be worn fast and seriously during 
high speed drilling. However, the thermal friction drill zealously utilizes the heat factor that is 
created from the friction between a drill and a workpiece, and then the drill would penetrate more 
easily after the workpiece was softened. Moreover, the friction drill would be prevented from the 
quickly wearing and would be presented the distinguished drilling efficiency (a hole is drilled 
typically only 8 sec). Therefore, the thermal friction drilling process enhanced the surface quality of 
 14
thermal friction drilling process could produce even and smooth surfaces of the machined holes, the 
machined surfaces were suitable for practical applications without further post treatment.

Figure 8 shows the photographs of the BL with various FCARs. The BL was formed near three 
times of the thickness of the plate in the thermal friction drilling. In addition, the longest BL was 
obtained at 50% FCAR. Since the thermal friction would soften the stainless plate and enhance the 
fluidity of plastic material on the drilling area, the ductile stainless plate was easily and fast to be 
pierced through at elevated temperature. Indeed, The friction drill with four leaves will work on an 
continual contact and generate the intermittent stirring effect on the hole wall of workpiece during 
drilling. Therefore, the intermittent stirring effect and feed rate of tool spindle direction will prolong 
the bushing length. Thus, small FCAR would enhance the fluidity of the softened material to obtain 
a longer BL.

contribution was calculated from the ratio of variance associated with each machining parameter. 
The statistically analysis results show that FCAR and the SS were the significant machining 
parameters of the thermal drilling process, which would obviously affect the multiple performance 
characteristics.

The amount of heat energy was enlarged in a moment due to high SS between drill and part. 
The high heat energy would soften the stainless steel and improve the machining performance. Thus, 
better surface quality of a drilled hole would be obtained. Moreover, since the thermal friction 
would soften the stainless plate and enhance the fluidity of plastic material on the drilling area. 
When 50% FCAR was adopted, the friction drill with four leaves will work on an continual contact 
and generate the intermittent stirring effect on the hole wall of workpiece during drilling. Therefore, 
the intermittent stirring effect and feed rate of tool spindle direction will prolong the bushing length. 
Thus, small FCAR would enhance the fluidity of the softened material to obtain a longer BL. 
Table 6 shows the response of the grey relational grades associated with the levels of each 
machining parameter, and the response graph is also shown in Figure 9. From the analysis results

experimental observed value obtained from the optimal combination levels of machining 
parameters not only the SR was reduced from 2.85 μm to 1.22 μm but also the BL was improved 
from 5.24 mm to 5.72. Moreover, the multiple performance characteristic was improved from 
0.5197 obtained under the initial experimental conditions FA (45 degree), FCAR (75%), FR (100 
mm/min), and SS (2400 RPM) to 0.8822 at the optimal combination levels of machining parameters 
from the grey relational analysis. Therefore, the experimental results confirm that the machining 
parameters would be optimized for the multiple performance characteristic associated with SR and 
BL for the developed process of thermal friction drilling. 
Figure 10 shows the top view and cross section of a drilled hole using the optimal parameters. As 
the cross section of machined hole, the BL of the drilled hole is near 3 times of the specimen 
thickness. The bushing can provide a longer contact area which can sustain a shaft firmly, and the 
hole surface was smooth like a mirror (Ra = 0.96 μm). The tolerance of a drilled hole was about ±
0.01 mm. The diameter of hole was almost similar to the diameter of drill. Expansion of the hole 
was rarely found in this study, therefore, it can be employed to serve as a cylindrical sleeve bearing. 
Moreover, it also can be taped to create an internal screw without especially welding an additional 
nut on the plate. Therefore, the thermal friction drilling can extensively reduce the complicated 
procedures of joining components in the aerospace and automotive industries.
