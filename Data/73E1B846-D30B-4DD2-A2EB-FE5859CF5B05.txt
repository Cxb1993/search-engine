Fig. 1 Measured Al composition, x , versus TMAl source flow composition in group III gas 
mixture ratio 両 . It shows that the Al composition saturated at 両  = 0.4 when the AlxGa1-xN 
epilayers were grown at 1110 oC. The solid curve is a theoretical fit. 
It was found that the Al composition increased with 両  when 両  was below 0.4, and became 
saturated when the gas phase composition was above 0.4. A theoretical model based on 
MMAl surface-adsorption-trapping was proposed as shown in the following figure to explain 
experimental results based on the kinetics of Al incorporation during the AlxGa1-xN MOVPE 
growth.
