ABSTRACT 
For more than ten years, the principal investigator has been devoted to the research on 
physiological and mental/conscious phenomena under Zen meditation. A number of important 
results have been reported, of which we mainly focus on investigating the EEG 
(electroencephalograph) characteristics based on the scientific approach. Subjects of the 
experiment practice the Zen Buddhism. From a large amount of meditation EEG signals 
acquired, we characterized their temporal and spectral features by a number of advanced DSP 
methodologies. Some particular findings aroused our attention of further exploring the spatial

experienced practitioners reported that they often could enter into a tranquil state of 
consciousness transcending beyond the physiological (the fifth), mental (the sixth), 
subconscious (the seventh), and Alaya (the eighth) conscious state (Chang & Lo, 2005). This 
study investigates EEG coherence in the phases of meditation and Zen-Chakra guarding as 
comparison with rest. The aims of the work are to obtain if there are changes of EEG 
coherence between left versus right hemispheres and frontal versus occipital cortex during 
meditation, to evaluate whether short-distance or long-distance coherence is more affected. 
 
METHOD AND MATERIAL 
1. Subjects 
In this study, twelve Zen-meditation practitioners (mean age: 32.5 year; range: 28?41 
years; four females; all right-handed) were investigated. Since reliable effects of meditation 
on the EEG activity were obtained mainly in experienced meditators, all were long-term 
practitioners with an average experience of 8.8 years (range 5 to 13 years) in Zen-Buddhist 
meditation practice.  
2. Procedure 
Previous studies on hundreds of practitioners revealed large between-group variations in 
EEG pattern. We thus aimed to investigate the within-subject behaviors during the entire 
meditation course. In the beginning 3 minutes, we collected the baseline data for each 
meditator under normal, eye-closed rest (R), without entering into meditation. Then they were 
instructed to begin a 40-min meditation. After the meditation, the subjects were asked to keep 
their eyes closed for an additional 3-min transition period. Then they were asked to practice a 
5-min Zen-Chakra focusing. During the recording period, the subjects sat in the full-lotus 
position with eyes closed. After the recording, the subjects were asked for an interview. M 
session indicates a 3-min artifact-free epoch extracted from the beginning after 30-min of

coherence are produced by different length fiber systems. Based on this model, EEG 
coherence were produced through at least two separate sources (1) the action of short length 
axonal connection, and (2) the action of long distance connections. Excluding volume 
conductor contribution, coherence between near electrodes is mainly influenced by short 
connections, since the axonal density per unit volume of cortex is approximately 10–100 
times higher for short-axoned stellate and Martinotti cells than for long-axoned pyramidal 
cells (Locatelli et al., 1998). On the contrary, the coherence between distant electrodes is 
mainly due to long axon connections.  
In order to evaluate whether the changes were mostly related to the short axonal fibers or 
to the long ones, coherences were calculated according to Thatcher et al. (1986) by averaged 
coherence among ‘local’ and ‘far’ recording sites overlying the distribution of different 
cortico-cortical fibers in order to have information about transmission of the underlying fibers. 
The average of the coherences between electrodes located in frontal and anterio-temporal 
regions were used for calculating the local anterior coherence (A: Fp1–F7, Fp2–F8, Fp1–F3, 
Fp2–F4, Fp1–C3 Fp2–C4, F7–C3, F8–C4, F3–C3 F4–C4, F3–F7 and F4–F8). For the 
posterior brain region, the local posterior coherence (P) was calculated as the average of 
coherence values between the electrode pairs: O1–P3, O2–P4, O1–P7, O2–P8, O1–C3, 
O2–C4, P3–C3, P4–C4, P7–C3, P8–C4, P3–P7 and P4–P8. For posterior to anterior 
coherence (P-A), we averaged coherences between pairs of electrodes O1–Fp1, O2–Fp2, 
O1–F3, O2–F4, O1–C3, O2–C4, O1–P3 and O2–P4 and for anterior to posterior 
coherence(A-P) Fp1–O1, Fp2–O2, Fp1–P3, Fp2–P4, Fp1–C3, Fp2–C4, Fp1–F3 and Fp2–F4, 
respectively(see Fig. 1(b)). This far coherence is assumed to be the mean coherence 
transmitted by the superior longitudinal fasciculus in both postero-anterior and 
antero-posterior directions (Locatelli, et al., 1998). Data from eight homologous right-left 
(R-L) electrode pairs were also examined as follows: Fp2-Fp1, F8-F7, F4-F3, T8-T7, C4-C3, 
P8-P7, P4-P3, O2-O1.

RESULTS 
For each meditator, coherences for the different bands showed a similar topographical 
distribution, without significant side asymmetries, decreasing as distance increased. In order 
to express all 171 combinations of electrode pairs, values of coherence difference (d-value) 
are displayed by a series of 19 brain maps. Each map shows the value of the coherence 
between the selected electrode and the remaining 18 signals. The position of a single map in 
the series is the position of the electrode taken into account: for example, the first map on the 
top left series of Fig. 2 shows the increase of theta coherence between Fp1 and the remaining 
electrodes in the M session compared with R.  
All our subjects showed coherence alterations. We found that many alterations are 
charged to beta band while no apparent modifications are present in slow frequency band as 
showed in Fig. 2. Coherence value was significantly higher for M and Z states compared with 
R state over a broad frequency band; the increase was more accentuated for the beta-1, beta-2 
and beta-3 coherences.  
The lines connecting electrode pairs indicate significantly increased coherences between 
the given points (Fig. 3). Beta-1 coherence was increased in half the analyzed pairs of 
electrodes (95pairs, p<0.05) in Z state compared with R state; the increase was more 
accentuated for the left anterior-to-right posterior coherences and the inter-hemispheric 
coherences of the anterior to central regions. Similar with beta-1, beta -2 coherence was 
greater in one-third of electrode pairs (60 pairs, p<0.05) for the Z, more evidently between 
electrodes over inter-hemispheric frontal- posterior regions and right intra-hemispheric 
anterior-posterior directions. As for beta-3 band, coherences tended to increase in the anterior 
and central electrodes in Z state compared with R state. Even if not so marked as the beta 
changes, there was a coherence decrease presented in Z state compared with R state in the left 
central regions for the delta band. Examining the difference between M state with R state (as

DISCUSSION 
1. Coherence function of different meditative phases 
In this experiment, meditation sessions M and Z were characterized by significantly 
higher beta band coherence over the broad cortical area. The increases are mostly for the 
beta-1 band, and secondly, beta-2 band. Even if not so marked as the beta-1, beta-3 band 
coherences also tended to increase in Z state compared with R state. 
Our results are different with those in earlier studies. Frontal and central alpha-1 power 
and frontal-central alpha-1 coherence have been reported during TM practice since 30 years 
ago (Hebert et al., 2005). Since that report, TM was characterized by significantly higher 
levels of alpha EEG coherence and has been reported to correlate with improvements in 
cognitive and emotional parameters such as moral reasoning, emotional stability and anxiety 
(Hebert et al., 2005). Dissimilar to their findings we have not seen the elevation of coherence 
reported in the above mentioned paper for the alpha frequency band in meditation. Instead, for 
low frequency band, coherence value was close to that obtained for the wakeful rest state.  
We observed an increase in beta coherence in comparison with wakefulness for most 
electrode combinations. Higher levels beta power and coherence indicates cortical areas 
involved in task processing and functional coupling (Thatcher et al., 1986) between brain 
regions. Also, transient synchronization of neuronal activity seems to be a key mechanism in 
the binding of anatomically distributed feature processing into coherent perceptual objects, 
where it is often associated with β or γ oscillations (Palva & Palva, 2007). Because Z state 
involves internal attention inside the third ventricle, enhancement of global, fast-band 
coherence may indicate the synchronization of massive distributive neural assemblies via the 
focusing process during Z state.
