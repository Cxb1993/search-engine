2一.前言與文獻探討
Since the completion of human gene decoding project in the 1990s, microarray analyses have been
widely applied on gene expression (Kan et al., 2006; Ruuska et al., 2002), diagnosis of influenza viruses
(Dawson et al., 2006), and many other fields (Wang and Cheng, 2005). Microarrays are promising alternatives
which surpass the potential of sequencing since they can detect thousands of genes in parallel. Further
development of this technology is still underway, particularly in the area of improving the hybridization
efficiency of immobilized DNA probes with their sample targets. The current research efforts are rooted on
the understanding that the hybridization efficiency directly indicates the success of the experimental design
and further data interpretation.
There were several current methodologies to measure the DNA hybridization efficiency. The
combination measurement of height and elastic compressibility of ss-DNA was verified an effective approach
to detect the hybridization of nanostructured DNA (Mirmomtaz et al., 2008). The surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) spectroscopy is an in situ label-free optical method to dynamically detect the hybridization efficiency in
the measurement of totalrefraction angles (Peterson et al., 2001). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
is another potential tool to measure DNA hybridization efficiency by its detection on the phosphorus
elemental composition, which specifically exists in a DNA strand (Liu et al., 2009). The gold nanoparticles
provide an advantage of rapid visual detection on DNA hybridization, but its applications are confined due to
the lack of signal dynamic ranges (Mao et al., 2009). The fluorescence labeling is still the traditional and
popular methodology due to its convenient interpretation and excellent dynamic range of signal intensity,
which is supposed to measure in proportion by one-fluorescent dye corresponding to one DNA molecule
(McQuain et al., 2004; Peytavi et al., 2005). The hybridization efficiency of DNA chips is critically affected
by the overall conditions, for instance, probe immobilization (Zammatteo et al., 2000), probe density
(Peterson et al., 2001), addition of a stabilizer (Maruyama et al., 2001), and hybridization conditions such as
incubation temperature and salt concentration (Rule et al., 1997), electric field (Fixe et al., 2004), agitation or
mixing (Deng et al., 2006; McQuain et al., 2004), and substrate surface conditions (Guo et al., 1994; Wu et al.,
2006). In addition to these overall conditions, the molecular-level studies has also been reported to improve
the hybridization efficiency of microarrayed DNA, such as immobilization of double-stranded probes
(Razumovitch et al., 2009), nucleotide structure of probe and target (Koehler and Peyret, 2005), probe size
and mismatch position (Letowski et al., 2004), effect of blocking oligo (Tao et al., 2003), effect of overhang
size on probes (Peytavi et al., 2005), DNA secondary structure (Koehler and Peyret, 2005), and target
prehybridization (Yang et al., 2008). However, these research efforts have mostly been confined to non-gene
targets. The manipulation and detection of a signature gene target actually is its corresponding gene product,
particularly which states more directly toward the realistic applications of diagnosis.
二.研究目的
In this study, we conducted a very direct investigation on a realistic system of gene targets. Their
probes were immobilized on planar slides with two reverse sequential blocks. We designed three sets of
targets, with each set having one plant and one human gene. These two quite distinct species were selected to
ensure the minimum opportunity for cross-hybridization between each other. Each set of targets hybridized
4plasmid genomic DNA. The PCR products were verified their production of single-stranded DNA by 1.5%
agarose gel electrophoresis.
3.2. Preparation of human ssDNA targets
An identical process as above was first tried to prepare the human genomic targets, but in vain. A
different approach was therefore conducted. The human cDNA was first produced from the total RNA by the
reverse-transcript (RT) PCR procedure instructed on the kit. Since low yield of PCR product was obtained
upon asymmetrically amplifying the cDNA template, we instead processed a regular PCR procedure to
generate enough dsDNA templates for the subsequent asymmetric PCR. The regular PCR procedure was
identical with the asymmetrical one described in the previous section, but with an equal ratio of two
none-labeled primers. They are ATP5O-F1/ATP5O-R1, PSMA5-F1/PSMA5-R1, or CANX-F1/CANX-R1.
The consequent PCR products were then separately undergone the asymmetrical PCR with proportion of
molar concentration 10–0.2 of the reverse to the second forward primers, cy3-ATP5O-F2, cy3-PSMA5-F2, or
cy3- CANX-F2. The production of single-stranded DNA was verified by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.
3.3. Probe microarraying, immobilization, and wash
The probes were spotted in microarrays with a concentration titration of 150, 100, 50, 10, 5, and 1
mM for the objective probes and 25M for the control probe. Ten chips were prepared with two duplicated 7
4-array blocks (blocks a, b, and c) on each chip. The probes were mixed with 20SSC and 100% glycerol to
the final concentrations and loaded onto a 384-hole microtiter plate to perform microarraying, followed by
incubation in a humid box at 30C for 16–18 h to immobilize the probes on the glass substrates. The spot size
was around 600 mm with vertical and horizontal spot-to-spot spacing of 1.5 mm and 1.2 mm. A wash step
was then applied to remove the free probes. The DNA chips were first immersed in 2X SSC/SDS for 10-min
shaking at 80 rpm. After ddH2O rinse, the second wash was with 2_ SSC in the same condition but without
SDS. The final wash was with 0.2_SSC for 10 min, and the slides were rinsed with ddH2O and spun to dry.
3.4. Hybridization of gene target with the probe
After pre-heating the chips to 50C, 45 l genetic target (made by 10 nM fluorescence-labeled
6Fig. 2. Sequence validation test for each DNA probe-target pair. Each member of the pair showed perfectly hybridized signals on
individual pre-designed microarrayed region. DNA targets pad06175, pda06122, and pda13015 were labeled with cy5 and the other
three human genes with cy3 fluorescence dyes. (JTICE_213, In press, May 2010)
4.2. Effect of hybridization location on hybridization efficiency
Fig. 3 shows the effect of hybridization location on hybridization efficiency for various DNA target
sizes and concentrations. Fig. 3a shows the result for hybridization location close to the slide surface, while
Fig. 3b is close to the top free solution phase. Cy3-labeled ATP5O (313b), PSMA5 (432b), and CANX
(1027b) served as the model genes individually hybridizing with two sequence-inversed probes. Readers can
refer to the corresponding hybridization configurations in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. Comparing Fig. 3a with
b indicates that a hybridization location close to the slide surface generally provided better hybridization
efficiency than a location close to the free solution, except for ATP5O at high probe concentration.
Hybridization at the location close to the free solution above the probe could be easier than that close to the
slide surface to allow the shacked wash buffer to wash off the hybridized gene targets.
Fig. 4 shows a similar test result for a shorter hybridization base–17mer. In this figure, we plotted
the signal reading of Cy5 in lines to avoid confusion with the previous bar-graphs of Cy3. With the same
implication as Fig. 3, the hybridization location close to the slide surface revealed better hybridization
efficiency than one close to the free solution, where target could be more easily de-hybridized from a
target-probe hybridized complex by washing. In this scenario, the steric hindrance effect also appeared for
pda13015 (528b) on probe_2, but not for other DNA targets.
8or to stack together with the pre-hybridized pda13015 (528b) on the coaxial shared probe. Their
corresponding hybridization configurations are shown in Fig. 5c and d. It can be concluded that the stacked
configuration clearly received a signal enhancement by the pre-hybridization of pda13015. The enhancement
contribution to the overall signal was roughly half fold on probe_1 and 1–3 folds on probe_2. However, this
enhancement phenomenon was not observed at high probe concentrations due to the steric effect mentioned
above. One possible explanation for this signal enhancement could be that the void space around the probe’s 
bare sections was propped open by the pre-hybridized pda13015, and this void space could facilitate the
subsequent CANX docking onto its binding site in the restricted environment. Another reasonable explanation
could be the change of probe conformation. The pre-hybridization of pda13015 could cause the tilt probe to
stand up, particularly probe_2, where the prehybridization occurred in the stem section. The standing
conformation of an immobilized probe generally provides better contact with approaching targets than tilted
or lying probes (Kaufmann et al., 2008).
Fig. 5. Signal enhancement by target
pre-hybridization. Compared with the individual
hybridization, CANX-cy3 (1027b) signal in the
stacked configuration was greatly enhanced by
the pre-hybridization of pda13015 (528b) on the
co-axially shared probes, (a) probe_1, (b)
probe_2. Their corresponding hybridization
configurations are shown in (c) and (d),
respectively. (JTICE_213, In press, May 2010)
4.4. Effect of pre-hybridization order on hybridization efficiency
The next issue of interest was addition inversion of gene targets. Could a similar signal

The hybridization efficiency was observed to decrease with increasing probe 
concentration for a short gene target. This steric effect occurred only when the 
target was individually hybridized at a location close to the substrate surface. 
Our results imply that an appropriate design for pre-hybridization of probes can 
enhance the DNA hybridization efficiency on microarrayed gene chips.
