本研究以理論的方法，分析一上下面分別黏著於剛性板的空心圓形彈性層，於承受
垂向壓力時的反應。根據兩個變形的基本假設，利用彈性力學理論，由平衡方程式建立
平均壓力的微分方程式。所用的第一個變形假設為﹕平行於剛性板的平面斷面，在變形
後仍然保持一平面。第二個變形假設為﹕垂直於剛性板的直線，在變形後成為一拋物
線。利用彈性層的應力邊界條件，可由平均壓力的微分方程式，解出平均壓力函數，進
而可推導出受剛性板束制之空心圓形彈性層的壓縮勁度公式，垂直應力分佈公式與黏著
面的剪應力公式。本研究亦利用有限元素分析法來証明所推導出壓縮勁度理論公式的精
確性。空心圓會造成的壓縮勁度的減少，研究發現當柏松比越接近 0.5，因空心圓所造
成的勁度減少量越大。當空心圓越小時，在內側邊所造成的剪力越大，此現象在高形狀
比而柏松比接近 0.5 的彈性層更明顯。

Abstract
A hollow-circular elastic layer bonded between rigid plates and subjected to a
compressive force normal to the layer is analyzed through a theoretical approach. On the
basis of two kinematic assumptions, the governing equation for the mean pressure is
established from the equilibrium equation. The mean pressure is then solved by satisfying the
stress boundary conditions in the elastic layer. Through the obtained pressure expression, the
compression stiffness of the bonded layer is derived in closed form and compared with the
result of finite element analysis. The stiffness reduction caused by the central hole is more
prominent when the Poisson’s ratio is close to 0.5. The effects of the central hole on the
vertical stress distribution in the elastic layer and the shear traction in the bonding surface are
also studied. A smaller central hole will generate higher shear traction at the inner edge,
especialy for the layers of large shape factor with the Poisson’s ratio near to 0.5.

4remain planar after loading; (ii) lines normal to the rigid bonding plates before deformation
become parabolic after loading. The governing equation of the mean pressure is derived from
the equilibrium equation, from which the mean pressure is solved by satisfying the stress
boundary conditions of the bonded layers. The compression stiffness of hollow circular
bearings is then derived and compared with the finite element solution. The effect of the
central hole on the vertical stress distribution in the elastic layer and the shear traction in the
bonding surface are also studied.
2. Solution for the pressure
A hollow-circular layer of linear elastic, homogeneous and isotropic material bonded
between two rigid plates, shown in Fig. 1, has outer diameter b2 , inner diameter a2 and
thickness t . The cylindrical coordinate system ),,( zr  is established with the origin at the
center of the layer. Under the compression force P , the elastic layer is in the axisymmetric
stress state so that the displacement in the  direction vanishes. The displacements in the r
and z directions, denoted as u and w respectively, are assumed as

where u is the horizontal displacement in the middle plane of the layer. Eq. (1) represents

assumption that planes parallel to the plates remain planar.

which indicates that the compression modulus in Eq. (17) is a function of Poisson’s ratio ,
shape factor S and radius ratio ba / . The compression modulus for the layers of 2S
and 20S with 1.0/ ba is plotted as a function of  in Fig. 2, which shows the
following characteristics of the bonded elastic layers: (1) The compression modulus increases
with increasing Poisson’s ratio; (2) The higher shape factor has the larger compression
modulus which dramatically increases when  is close to 0.5. Fig. 2 also shows the result
calculated by the finite element method, which is very close to the theoretical solution. The
four-node axisymmetric elements with incompatible modes are used in the finite element
models. The elements are square and there are four layers of finite element mesh in the half
thickness of the elastic layers. The solution derived through the “approximate pressure
solution”approach by Constantinou and Kartoum (1992), which has typing error in the
original paper and has been corrected here, is plotted in Fig. 2 which indicates that the
“approximate pressure solution”approach is accurate only when the shape factor is high and
the Poisson’s ratio is near 0.5, and the derived compression modulus cannot converge to the 
elastic modulus of the layers when thePoisson’s ratio becomes zero.

By using the pressure solution in Eq. (10), the effective vertical stress in Eq. (15) can be
derived and is plotted in Fig. 6 as a function of br / , where the effective vertical stress is
normalized by the average compression stress cc E . The figure shows that the vertical stress
is uniformly distributed in the layers with smal Poisson’s ratio )45.0(  and large shape
factor )20( S . The vertical stress is symmetrical to the middle of annual thickness in the
layers of large radius ratio )5.0/( ba , but not in the layers of small radius ratio

The distribution of shear strain along the radius is plotted in Fig. 7 for 01.0/ ba , which
reveals that the shear traction increases more sharply near the inner edge in the layers of
49995.0 , especially for 20S , but such sharp increment in shear traction does not
happen in the layers of 5.0/ ba plotted in Fig. 8. Both figures show that the layers of
larger shape factor or larger Poisson’s ratio have larger shear traction.
As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, most of the bonded layers have the maximum shear traction
at the inner edge, except for the layers of small shape factor )2( S and small radius ratio
)01.0/( ba , where the maximum shear traction occurs at the outer edge. The shear strain at
the inner edge ar  is

The maximum bonding shear strain is plotted in Fig. 9 as a function of shape factor, which
indicates that the maximum bonding shear strain increases with increasing the shape factor
except for the layers of 1.0/ ba and 5.0/ ba with 45.0 . For the layers of large
shape factor, the maximum shear strain increases with decreasing the radius ratio. The effect
