一、摘要： 
本計畫在探討具有極薄高銦組成通道層

This project is to study InP-based high elec-
tron mobility transistors (HEMTs) with an ul-
tra-thin high-indium-composition channel layer. 
We use APSYS software to simulate the char-
acteristics of an InP-based HEMT. It’s found 
that impact ionization is largely suppressed 
when the channel becomes very thin. Using Sb 
doping, the high-indium-composition channel 
can be grown with good epitaxial quality even 
at increased thickness. Experimental results 
show that the impact ionization has been sup-
pressed at the cost of electron mobility.

二、介紹： 
A very thin channel largely increases the 
separation in energy of the electron and hole 
quantum levels in the conduction channel of a 
high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). The 
virtually increased effective bandgap in the 
quantum channel reduces the probability of im-
pact ionization and enhances the device break-
down voltage, which is usually low in the 
high-In HEMTs due to the small bandgap of the 
channel [1]. The high indium content used in 
the channel provides high electron mobility and 
thus enhances the device’s high-frequency per-
formance [2,3]. 
In this project, we use APSYS software to 
simulate and analyze the device characteristics. 
Then MBE is used to grow the HEMT structure 
with an ultra-thin fully-strained InGaAs channel 
with very high In composition. Sb doped as 
surfactant for the high-In In(Ga)As channel 
growth largely improves the channel quality. 
 
三、研究方法： 
We first use APSYS software to test the 
effect of the ultra-thin InAs channel on the 
breakdown characteristics of an InP-based 
HEMT. The simulation result (Fig. 1) shows 
that an ultra-thin channel increases the 
breakdown voltage by largely suppressing 
impact ionization. The epi wafers used in this 
project are grown by solid-source molecular 
beam epitaxy (MBE) on (100)-oriented 
semi-insulating InP substrates and then 
characterized by PL, AFM and Hall. 
 
四、結果與討論： 
To obtain a high-In InGaAs channel, which 
causes substantial strain due to large lattice 
mismatch with the substrate, the influence of Sb 
doping in the InGaAs channel on the epitaxial 
quality is tested. The device structure with a 
composite channel (10-nm In0.83Ga0.17As and 
5-nm In0.53Ga0.47As) is shown in Fig. 2. The Sb 
doping is applied only in the 10-nm 
In0.83Ga0.17As layer. As shown in Fig. 3, Sb 
doping enhances the room-temperature PL 
spectra, indicating the quality improvement of 
the high-In InGaAs channel. Fig. 4 shows AFM 
results for the samples without and with Sb 
doping, respectively. It’s obvious that Sb doping 
significantly improves the atomic-scale surface 
morphology, which implies better epitaxial 
qualtiy. Hall mobility, together with the 
integrated PL intensity, as a function of Sb
