Introduction 
Recent advances in integrated circuit technology make it possible to construct very large 
interconnection networks. Together with these advances, many interconnection network 
topologies have been proposed and investigated in the literature. Among these topologies, the 
recursive circulant graph, denoted by , is one of the more popular topologies. Network 
topology is usually represented by a graph, G=(V,E), where the set of vertices V(G) represents 
processors, and the set of edges E(G) represents links between processors. A path is a 
Hamiltonian path if its vertices are distinct and span V(G). A graph G is Hamiltonian connected if 
there exists a hamiltonan path joining any two vertices of G. A cycle is a path (except the first 
vertex is the same as the last vertex) contains at least three vertices. A Hamiltonian cycle of G is a 
cycle that traverses every vertex of G exactly once. A graph is Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian 
cycle. The ring embedding problem, which deals with all the possible lengths of the cycles in a 
given graph, is investigated in a lot of interconnection networks. In general, a graph is pancyclic 
if it contaims a cycle of every length from 4 to |V(G)| inclusive. A graph G is k-fault-tolerant 
pancyclic if G-F remains pancyclic for any

The graph we deal with here is the circulant graph  proposed by Park and Chwa 
[12].  This family belongs to the family of circulant graphs denoted by G  with

G(16,4), as shown in Figure 1. Several interesting properties of  have been proposed 
in the literature [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14]. For example, it was proved by Park and Chwa [12] 
that  is an m-connected and Hamiltonian graph. The embedding of meshes and 
hypercubes are studied in Park and Chwa [12]. The embedding of trees are studied by Lim et. al.

Main result 
A graph is pancyclic if it has a cycle of length l for every 4 ≤ l ≤ |V|, and it is called edge-pancyclic 
if every edge lies on a cycle of length l for all l = 4,..., |V|. 
Theorem 3[3]: The recursive circulant graph is edge-pancyclic.  )4,2( mG
Since G(2m,4) has good recursive structure properties, We can use the inductive method to prove 
our conjecture. First at all, we can prove the base cases G(8,4) is 1-fault-tolerant pancyclic and 
G(16,4) is 2-fault-tolerant pancyclic. 
Lemma 1: Assume that fv denotes the number of faulty node in G(8,4) and fe denotes the number 
of faulty edge in G(8,4), and fv+fe ≦1. G(8,4) has every cycle of length from 4 to 2m-fv. 
Lemma 2: Assume that fv denotes the number of faulty node in G(16,4) and fe denotes the 
number of faulty edge in G(16,4), and fv+fe ≦ 2. G(16,4) has every cycle of length from 4 to 
2m-fv.
