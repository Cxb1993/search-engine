1. Introduction 
Adaptive immunity can be classified into two branches of immune responses: cellular 
immunity mediated by T cell lymphocytes that eliminate infected cells, and humoral 
immunity mediated by B lymphocytes secreting antibodies which neutralize pathogens in the 
body fluid. Historically, protection against pathogenic infections was achieved by vaccination 
with whole pathogens, such as the Sabin polio vaccine (Sabin, 1959). More recently, safety 
concerns led to the alteration of immunogen formulations from whole particles to pathogen 
surface antigens or polypeptides (Herrera et al., 1990). As compared with methods for 
locating the B-cell epitope in an antigen, the methods for prediction of epitopes in T-cells that 
bind MHC class I were state-of-the-art and covered most of the known HLA specificities, as 
well as predicted MHC class II binding (reviewed in (Lundegaard et al., 2007)). There are 
two categories of B-cell epitopes: the linear epitope (LE), segments composed of a 
continuous stretch of amino acid residues, and the conformational epitope (CE) constituted 
by several sequentially discontinuous segments that are folded into a native protein structure 
(Barlow et al., 1986; Van Regenmortel, 2006). The development of a reliable tool to predict 
and identify precise antigenic determinants in biological experiments or peptide vaccine 
design is important for molecular and allergic immunologists. In addition, the use of high 
specificity antigens selected by computational algorithms significantly facilitates 
improvement of immune response against specific targets. In recent years, various 
combinations of antigen physico-chemical properties, such as surface accessibility (Emini et 
al., 1985), hydrophilicity (Parker et al., 1986), flexibility (Vihinen et al., 1994), and 
secondary structure (Debelle et al., 1992), have been considered in epitope predictive 
algorithms (Doytchinova and Flower, 2007). The distinguishing characteristics among 
currently available programs such as BcePred (Saha and Raghhava, 2004), BEPITOPE 
(Odorico and Pellequer, 2003), PEOPLE (Alix, 1999), and VaxiJen (Doytchinova and Flower, 
2007) are mainly in the computation of different weighting scales over a sliding window 
along a query protein sequence. The accuracies of these LE prediction methods have been 
previously examined (Pellequer et al., 1991; Alix, 1999; Saha and Raghhava, 2004; 
Doytchinova and Flower, 2007).   
  In 2005, Blythe and Flower hypothesized that “single-scale amino acid 
propensity profiles can not be used to predict epitope location reliably” (Blythe and Flower, 
2005), a conclusion based on the observation that in the field of epitope prediction, even the 
best physico-chemical propensity scales were not accurate enough to estimate and predict 
qualified B cell epitopes. Therefore, the improved sequence-based B cell epitope prediction 
tools integrated the concept of amino acid propensity scales with other methodologies, such 
as hidden Markov model (HMM) (Larsen et al., 2006) and Molecular Operating Environment 
(MOE) (Sollner and Mayer, 2006). However, in general when machine learning approaches 
are applied, the window length of input peptides must be fixed. Hence it is difficult to 
analyze the LEs which are typically composed of 8 to 20 amino acid residues (Roberts et al., 
1996; Alix, 1999; Florea et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2007). Most current studies sought to 
improve the machine learning approaches; two artificial neural network methods were 
developed, the feed-forward (FNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), for the prediction 
of continuous B-cell epitopes (Saha and Raghava, 2006). Both FNN and RNN networks were 
used to achieve B-cell epitope prediction using different window lengths from 10 to 20 amino 
acids with a two residue interval. 
In analyzing the LEs in the AntiJen database, some regions with relatively high local 
antigenicity scales, but not high enough at global scales, were found to be actual epitopes 
(Toseland et al., 2005). In general, antigenicity analyses provide an index representing 
physico-chemical properties, and users must estimate the potential antigenic regions based on 
their own experience or a reasonable cut-off line. However, most researchers do not notice 
the local peaks below the designated threshold of an antigenic index. To date, little is known 
about how to estimate the antigenicity of peptides precisely except examining the 
physico-chemical properties of amino acids. In addition, why some peptides with relatively 
 6
range [0,1]. 
To emphasize the categories for antigenicity calculation, the system provided several 
additional options such as polarity, hydrophobicity, and some other miscellaneous factors.  
For each category, users can set the weighting coefficients to reinforce the characters of their 
special concern. In the categories of secondary structure, hydrophilicity, surface accessible, 
and polarity, users can select preferred calculation methods. All these various amino acid 
scales, defined by a numerical value to each type of amino acid,  can be obtained from 
ProtScale which allows a user to obtain detailed information of author, reference, and amino 
acid scale values (Gasteiger et al., 2005). 
Mathematical morphology and local peak determination 
 Mathematical morphology is a theoretical model for signal analysis built on lattice 
theory and topology with applications to one, two, or n-dimensional signals (Serra, 1982; 
Maragos and Schafer, 1987; Giardina and Dougherty, 1988; Serra, 1988). Signals interacting 
with a predetermined structuring element are processed under four basic operations: erosion, 
dilation, opening, and closing. Geometrically, the erosion and dilation operations shrink and 
expand the signal, respectively; the opening and closing operations smooth sharp positive and 
negative edges, respectively. Combinations of these basic operations provide a wide range of 
signal processing options for different applications. In this study, once the antigenic scale of a 
query protein was determined, the mathematical morphology approach was utilized to extract 
potential antigenic segments. First, the erosion process was implemented to identify the 
minimal value in a sliding window (the structuring element within WinSize (P)), and the 
minimum was selected to replace the value at the midpoint of the window. The sequential 
values identified by the erosion process were designated the “eroded profile.” Second, the 
dilation operation extracted the maximal value in a sliding window to substitute for the 
midpoint value, and the combination of erosion and dilation operations resulted in an 
“opened profile.” Finally, the local peak segments were identified by subtraction of the 
opened profile from the original profile.  
The default settings of WinSize (C) for calculating antigenicity scale, WinSize (P) for 
extracting local peaks, and Peak Size for filtering minimal size of LE to each category were 7, 
9, and 9, respectively. These default parameters were selected based on the optimal 
performance in terms of accuracy analysis from AntiJen dataset (Liu, 2007). The global 
antigenicity was defined as the average of the whole protein sequence antigenicity, and the 
low-to-moderate antigenicity meant the antigenicity of a predicted peptide lower than that of 
global antigenicity. 
 
Extraction of linear epitope candidates  
 In this paper, the antigenic scale of each amino acid was calculated by applying a 
running mean window within default settings. LE candidates were extracted when the 
average antigenicity of residues was continuously higher than that of the entire sequence or 
when the residues were located within local peaks with relatively higher antigenicity than 
neighbouring residues. For fragments with globally or locally high antigenic residues, a 
merging function was performed to identify the predicted LEs, which were displayed and 
ranked according to the difference between the maximal and minimal antigenicity scales. 
Ordering the predicted LEs by antigenicity difference in a peptide increased the possibility of 
LEs residing in local peaks to squash into higher ranking positions. The “local peak” LE 
candidates represented the low-to-moderate predicted LEs labelled in red annotation on the 
output web pages.  
 
Performance measurement 
 To evaluate the performance of the LEP-LP method at peptide- and residue-based levels, 
the key factors used were the LEP-LP default settings including four parameters, (1) 
sensitivity defined as the percentage of epitopes that are correctly predicted as epitopes; (2) 
specificity defined as the percentage of non-epitopes correctly predicted as non-epitopes; (3) 
positive predictive value (PPV) denoted as the probability that a predicted epitope is, in fact, 
an epitope; and (4) accuracy denoted as the proportion of correctly predicted peptides (Saha 
 8
 
Evaluation 
 To further verify the performance of LEP-LP, epitope information collected from the 
AntiJen and Pellequer datasets were utilized. The AntiJen dataset assembled 3619 epitopes, 
and 3168 were found in the Swiss-Prot database. After eliminating 562 repeated epitopes and 
283 epitopes not allocated in the retrieved protein sequences, 2323 epitopes were allocated 
and classified into 172 protein sequences for evaluation.  Interestingly, the primary 
sequences of many of the 2323 epitopes overlapped. After epitope merging, only 691 
epitopes in 172 protein sequences were considered for this study.  
The 172 sequences were individually imported into our system for sequential 
verification of predicted LEs (Supplementary File 1). If taking the average antigenicity as a 
threshold setting, the results showed that 507 predicted LEs overlapped with the epitopes in 
the AntiJen database. Of the total 691 epitopes, 304 epitopes possessed low-to-moderate 
antigenicity scales and among which 164 were predicted by LEP-LP (Supplementary File 2). 
Therefore, 54% (164/304) of the epitopes that would have been disregarded were retrieved by 
LEP-LP. For the AntiJen data set, our LEP-LP system exhibited an average of 57.16% 
sensitivity and 45.11% specificity based on the residue levels. 
In addition to AntiJen, the Pellequer dataset was also applied to examine the 
performance of LEP-LP. The Pellequer dataset contains 15 protein sequences and 94 
experimentally determined B-cell linear epitopes (Odorico and Pellequer, 2003). To compare 
the performance of LEP-LP with other LE prediction methods, two existing predictors with 
reliable accuracies were employed and analyzed.  The Pellequer dataset was analyzed by 
BEPITOPE, which applied the predictive power of a consensus voting method based on the 
prediction of turns in proteins (Odorico and Pellequer, 2003), and BepiPred, which combined 
the antigenicity and hidden Markov model (HMM) approaches (Larsen et al., 2006). Under 
the default parameter settings, the linear epitope prediction system with local peak 
consideration (LEP-LP), the system without local peak consideration (LEP-NLP), BepiPred, 
and BEPITOPE predicted 129, 97, 77, and 60 LE candidates, respectively. If a predicted 
epitope overlapped 4 or more continuous residues with experimentally verified epitopes, the 
particular epitope was considered to be correctly predicted; among the 129 candidates 
predicted by LEP-LP, 76 peptides were correctly predicted and 53 peptides were false 
positive. LEP-LP was unable to predict 18 epitopes, thus the peptide level sensitivity and 
PPV were respectively calculated as 80.85% and 58.91%. According to the analyses shown in 
Supplementary File 3, 32 LEP-LP predicted candidates located at the local peaks, among 
which 13 overlapped with experimentally verified epitopes (marked in bold). Therefore, 
40.6% (13/32) of the predicted local peaks were experimentally proven as actual linear 
epitopes. When the contribution of local peak extraction was out of consideration, the 
sensitivity was significantly reduced from 80.85% to 67.02%, even though the PPV slightly 
increased from 58.91% to 64.95%. Using the BepiPred prediction, the peptide level 
sensitivity and PPV were respectively 54.26% and 66.23%, whereas those of data predicted 
employing BEPITOPE were 54.62% and 85%. Comparing the performance of LEP-LP, 
BepiPred, and BEPITOPE based on peptide level criterion showed that the sensitivity for 
each system was 80.85%, 54.26%, and 54.62% and the PPV was 58.91%, 66.23%, and 
85.00%. This indicates that our method is superior in sensitivity, but performed inferiorly in 
PPV.   
According to the residue level calculation in the Pellequer dataset, the sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV and accuracy of LEP-LP was 63.75%, 54.66%, 51.80%, and 57.69% and of 
LEP-NLP was 55.10%, 68.78%, 57.52%, and 61.74%, respectively.  In comparison with 
BepiPred and BEPITOPE, both LEP-LP and LEP-NLP provided higher sensitivity, but less 
specificity due to increased number of false predicted residues. The LEP-NLP resulted in 
higher specificity and overall accuracy than LEP-LP, presumably because peptide residing in 
a local peak possesses lower antigenicity, such that the possibility of correct prediction of 
epitopes from low antigenicity peptides is much lower than that from high antigenicity 
peptides. Therefore, the rate of false prediction increases faster than that of sensitivity with 
respect to the lower antigenicity peptides. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
