Protein structure alignment is of importance in protein study. In general, such task 
can be divided into two categories, i.e. global and local structure alignment. In this paper, 
one-dimensional features are extracted first from the original protein structures. A hybrid 
approach combining dynamic time warping and least squares adjustment is proposed for 
global alignment of protein 3D structures in an iterative fashion, where dynamic time 
warping is responsible for coarse alignment of two structure and least squares adjustment 
handles the fine matching of amino acid residues. The residuals of matched pairs are util-
ized to calculate the weights to accelerate the convergence of coarse-to-fine matching. 
The preliminary results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the pro-
posed approach. However, there is still a room for improvement in terms of accuracy and 
memory usage. 
 
Keywords: protein structure alignment, dynamic time warping, least squares adjustment,

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Comparing three-dimensional protein structures is one of the most important issues 
in structural proteomics and is helpful in solving the problems of protein folding, motif 
finding, drug design, and etc. In general, the task of structure alignment is performed 
globally or locally. In global alignment, two protein structures are usually aligned by af-
fine transformation to calculate the root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of three-
dimensional coordinates, while local alignment aims at matching segments with maxi-
mum local similarity between two structures. For example, Taylor and Orengo (1989) 
proposed an approach using double dynamic programming for the global alignment prob-
lem. Subsequently, their approach (Orengo and Taylor, 1993) was applied to the local 
alignment problem by using the torsion (phi and psi) angles and solvent accessibility to 
accelerate the computation of local alignment. Evaluating the structural environment of a 
residue, however, is difficult. Later, Hiroike and Toh (2001) proposed a method to con-
struct a structural environment that was robust against circular permutation. Akutsu and 
Horimoto (2001) proposed a novel approach to multiple local structure alignment by in-
tegrating physicochemical characteristics and structural information of protein sequences 
to form a number of numeric profiles. These profiles were then recoded back to some al-
phabetic sequences to facilitate the task of local alignment. Lehtonen et al. (1999) devel-

The reason of extracting the parallelepiped volume is obvious. It simply reduces the 
original structure information in three-dimensional space to a profile in one dimension. 
Note that the order of calculating the parallelepiped volume for each residue should be 
consistent. Moreover, the value of parallelepiped volume is signed, depending on the di-
rections of three vectors. It is worthy of mention that the value of parallelepiped volume 
becomes zero if five consecutive residues are aligned along a straight line. In the event 
that residues are aligned with equal interval along a perfect helix, such as a spring, the 
volume profile then forms a function of just a constant for each residue. In any cases 
other than these two extreme examples, parallelepiped volume is strongly capable of re-
flecting the characteristic of a local structure. Without normalizing the norm of all vec-
tors, the value of parallelepiped volume also indicates the extent of closeness among lo-
cal residues.

2.3. Least Squares Adjustment 
Although dynamic time warping is a very advantageous approach relevant to se-
quence matching problems and has been employed in a wide variety of areas, the out-
come of protein structure alignment using its standard version may not be satisfactory. 
The reason partially lies in the ignorance of adjacency between residues. In other words, 
the optimal warping path does not take into account that any little difference between two 
local structures that should be matched will result in a deviation from a perfectly matched 
path. It is because the algorithm always tries to find a path with the minimum distance 
(or difference). It turns out that the aligned structures may contain one-to-many match-
ing. To remedy the potential problem mentioned above, the matched result is regarded as 
a rough alignment, which provides a number of one-to-one matched pairs of points for 
solving the transformation parameters. 
In general, it suffices to transform protein structures by rotation and translation. 
Without loss of generality, suppose there are Nm pairs of one-to-one matched points ex-
tracted from the warping path P. The transformation z = T(y) can be expressed as

Fig. 3 Convergence profiles for the four cases of globally similar (1DHFa/3DFR), locally similar 
(3ICB/4CPV), difficult (1BGEb/2GMFa), and different (1XWM/1Q3B), respectively. 
 
Two globally similar proteins 1DHFa and 3DFR are compared, as shown in Fig. 4. 
The test protein in Fig. 4(c) is transformed and superposed on the reference one for com-
parison. The profiles of parallelepiped volume (pv) are shown in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e), re-
spectively, where the x-axis indicates the residue index along the protein. As shown in 
Fig. 4(f), the final matched path has been improved by dynamic time warping with least 
squares adjustment. The aligned result is rather perfect and comparable with those of CE 
(Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998) and VAST data banks (Gibrat et al., 1996). Two locally 
similar protein structures evaluated by Orengo and Taylor (1993) are selected for this 
study as well. The result of alignment in Fig. 5 is satisfactory but not as accurate as that 
of the globally similar one.

As mentioned previously and shown in Fig. 6, two protein structures 1BGEb and 
2GMFa reported in the literature (Fischer et al., 1996; Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998; 
Chen et al., 2005) are considered to be rarely similar and difficult for alignment. The 
ambiguous result shows that the alignment is a failure. After thorough examination of the 
experiment, two factors are identified. First, the proposed approach treats protein struc-
tures as rigid body and is not appropriate for the case of inexact alignment. A compro-
mising solution for coordinate transformation may not be an optimal one. Second, too 
many small pieces of matched structures are similar in terms of local features, not the ac-
tual coordinates. Accordingly, these matched points are not representative enough to put 
together for solving transformation parameters by using least squares adjustment. 
More pairs of protein structures are provided in Fig. 7, 8, 9 for the cases of global, 
local, difficult alignments, respectively. As compared with those by the CE method listed 
in Table 1, the results of global alignment shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the proposed approach. In the cases of local alignment shown in Table 
1 and Fig. 8, the unsatisfactory results reveal that protein structures mainly consisting of 
α-helix structures will result in an ambiguous matching. Protein structures identified to 
be difficult for alignment are illustrated in Fig. 9. The results show that these pairs are in 
fact aligned; however, the RMSD values are larger. The obvious reason is due to the lack 
of elastic matching for protein structures with less similarity. 
4. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a hybrid approach to the problem of global alignment of protein struc-
tures is presented. The representative feature of each amino acid residue is extracted by 
calculating the volume of a parallelepiped derived from the coordinates of five consecu-
tive residues. Dynamic time warping is the key step for approximate alignment. Least 
squares adjustment provides a chance to refine the matched result, which then feeds back 
to the step of approximate alignment in an iterative fashion. It is expected that two simi-
lar structures can be optimally matched in only few iterations. Thirteen pairs of protein 
structures with different degree of similarity are aligned for demonstration in this paper. 
The preliminary results are satisfactory. The proposed feature, in general, is representa-
tive, but cannot handle the ambiguous cases of too many α-helix structures. More works 
regarding accuracy evaluation instead of using RMSD should be done soon. An auto-
matic mechanism for filtering out dissimilar structures is necessary as well. However, 
there is still a room to improve the structure alignment in terms of accuracy and memory 
usage. Attention will be paid to the problems when locally similar structures in two pro-
teins are located in different order, which cannot be solved by dynamic time warping. 
Elastic or non-rigid alignment of two structures should be addressed in the future work.
