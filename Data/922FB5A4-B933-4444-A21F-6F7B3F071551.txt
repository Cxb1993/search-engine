B、 英文摘要 
    The nonvolatile memory (NVM) can 
store data for long time without any power 
supply, so it is very popular for the portable 
equipment, such as mobile phone and MP3 
player. However, all of the charges stored in 
CVD. However, low-temperature 
PVD-deposited ZrO2 films usually contain 
numerous traps, resulting in poor electrical 
characteristics. In general, high-temperature 
annealing is required to reduce the traps and 
enhance the qualities of PVD-deposited ZrO2 
films [6]. Nevertheless, for high-k metal 
oxide materials, the high temperature process 
will cause a thicker interfacial layer and will 
crystallize high-k films, the latter possibly 
leading to additional leakage current from the 
grain boundary [9]. 
In this project, we propose a high 
pressure ozone treatment at 150 °C to 
passivate the traps of sputter-deposited ZrOx 
films. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was 
used to observe the structure of 
sputter-deposited high-k dielectric. The 
chemical bonding improvement by ozone 
passivation at low temperature between 
zirconium and oxygen can be analyzed by 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The 
ozone passivated ZrOx films also exhibit 
improved electrical characteristics, including 
the leakage current, dielectric constant, 
fixed-charge density and CV hysteresis. The 
corresponding mechanisms are also analyzed 
and discussed here. In addition, the 
nanostructure was found during fabrication 
process of NVMs. To investigate the growth 
mechanism of nanostructures, the 
morphology and crystal structures after 
SCCO2 treatment were observed by a 
scanning electron microscope (SEM).

(3-1 Improvement of Sputtered ZrOx 
Dielectric by High Pressure Ozone 
Passivation) 
 
3-1-1 Experiment 
In this experiment, the ZrOx films were 
deposited on p-type (100) silicon wafers by 
RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature 
with an argon (Ar) flow rate of 10 sccm. The 
base pressure and power were set to 8 mtorr 
and 80W. The thickness of as-deposited ZrOx 
films was about 10nm. Then, the samples 
were split into three groups, and processed 
with different post-treatments to study the 
properties of low-temperature-deposited ZrOx 
film. The first sample, labeled as “STD”, was 
designed as the standard sample without any 
treatment. The second sample, labeled as “O2”, 
was placed in a pressure-proof stainless steel 
chamber and treated under ambient O2 with a 
pressure of 1000psi at 150 °C for 2 hrs. For 
the third sample, an additional UV light of 
350W was applied for 2 hours under the same 
pressure to produce O3 during the passivation 
treatment. Thus, the third sample was labeled 
as “O3”. Because O3 has superior passivation 
ability than O2, it can further suppress leakage 
current density and improve capacitance 
characteristics. After these different 
treatments, the Al electrodes were thermally 
evaporated on the top surface of ZrOx films 
and the bottom side of silicon wafer to 
fabricate metal insulator semiconductor (MIS) 
capacitors. The physical thicknesses and 
chemical bonding states of ZrOx films were 
individually analyzed by high-resolution 
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) 
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 
In addition, electrical characteristics of 
current density-voltage (J-V) and 
capacitance-voltage (C-V) were measured by 
HP 4156-C semiconductor parameter analyzer 
and Agilent 4284-A CV meter. 
 
3-1-2 Results and Discussion 
 Figure 1 shows the HRTEM images of 
STD ZrOx films (1a) and films with O2 (1b), 
and O3 (1c) passivations. All images clearly 
show that the ZrOx films exhibit two 
amorphous interfacial layers between the 
passivations for 2 hours, the values decrease 
drastically to 8.1×10−7 A/cm2 and 3.5×10−8 
A/cm2. The O3 passivation shows the best 
improvement by four orders of magnitude 
when compared to the STD sample. In order 
to further realize the behavior of leakage 
current for treated ZrOx films, the leakage 
currents of STD and O3 passivated films 
operated in negative bias region were 
analyzed. In general, there are several 
conduction mechanisms for the insulator, 
including Schottky emission, Frenkel-Poole 
emission, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and 
trap-assisted tunneling [14-17]. However, the 
leakage current in sputtered dielectric without 
any passivation treatment was usually 
dominated by trap-assisted tunneling. For the 
trap assisted tunneling, it is assumed that 
electrons tunnel through traps located below 
the conduction band of the high-k thin film 
and leak to substrate finally. The equation of 
leakage current density is [14]: 
]exp[
VV
J βα −=       (1) 
Here, αand β are constants. For the 
STD ZrOx film, the results exhibit a linear 
relationship between ln (J*V) and the 
reciprocal of voltage (1/V), as shown in Fig. 5. 
The result indicate the leakage current 
mechanism in the standard sample is 
dominated by trap-assisted tunneling due to a 
large number of traps in ZrOx and interfacial 
layers, as depicted in the schematic energy 
band diagram insert.  
However, when the ZrOx film is treated 
by O3 passivation, the ln (J) shows a linear 
dependence on the square root of applied 
voltage (V) due to the Schottky emission 
mechanism, as shown in Fig. 6. The equation 
of leakage current density for the Schottky 
emission is as following [17]: 
⎟⎠
⎞⎜⎝
⎛ −= TkBSRφβ 21SR2* EexpTAJ    (2) 
where ( ) 2103SR 4q επεβ = , q  is the 
electronic charge, *A  is the effective 
Richardson constant, SRφ  is the contact 
potential barrier, E  is the applied electric 
field, 0ε  is the permittivity in vacuum, ε  is 
the high frequency relative dielectric constant, 
T is the absolute temperature, and Bk  is the 
Boltzmann constant. Because the Schottky 
emission is mainly caused by the electron 
transport across the potential energy barrier 
via field-assisted lowering at a metal-insulator 
interface, the result clearly appears that most 
traps in the leakage paths are passivated 
during the O3 treatment. 
In addition to the IV characteristics, the 
C-V characteristics are commonly used to 
determine the interface qualities of dielectric 
films. Figure 7 shows C-V characteristics of 
the three ZrOx films measured at 1 MHz with 
gate bias swing. The gate bias is swept from 
negative voltage to positive voltage (forward) 
and immediately from positive voltage to 
negative voltage (reverse). Compared to O2 
and O3 treated samples, the STD ZrOx film 
exhibits the lowest Cmax value, worse transient 
slope from Cmax to Cmin and an unfavorable 
flatband voltage shift (ΔV) with different bias 
swing directions due to the large number of 
traps and weaker chemical bonding in the 
ZrOx film and at the interface regions. In 
these samples, the O3 treated ZrOx film shows 
the best C-V characteristics. Although the 
Cmax value can be improved after O2 treatment, 
the negligible flatband voltage shift and the 
highest Cmax value further demonstrate that 
the quality of low temperature 
sputter-deposited ZrOx film can be effectively 
improved by O3 treatment due to its superior 
passivation ability.

evidence that the nanotube structures are 
grown from Zn thin film after treated by 
SCCO2 fluid mixed with D.I. water. 
 
3-2-3 Conclusion 
This research demonstrates nanotubes 
with small diameter size by a supercritical 
CO2 (SCCO2) fluid technology at a 
temperature as low as 60 oC. The H2O oxidant 
may be easily carried into the Zn thin film at 
low temperature due to the high diffusivity 
and high pressure of SCCO2 fluid technology. 
This speeds up the formation of the nanotube 
in the SCCO2 fluid environment from zinc 
thin film at low temperature. Therefore, we 
will investigate the material properties of the 
nanostructure formed by SCCO2 fluid 
technology in the future.
