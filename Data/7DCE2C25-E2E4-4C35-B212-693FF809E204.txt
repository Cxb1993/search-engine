3. 計畫主要內容 
 
在此計畫中，我們將研究並開發一系列設計技術和工具來解決三維晶片中在設計、測試與驗證
中將會遇到的挑戰，在此計畫中我們分為兩方面分別為設計階段與測試驗證階段來提出完整的
解決方案: 
設計階段: 
由於從二維晶片轉為三維晶片設計，樓層規劃、電路佈局與繞線將對電路整體效能占有舉足輕
重的地位，因此本計畫將開發一套以三維晶片電路為主的熱警覺導向的樓層規劃、電路佈局與
繞線自動化軟體以輔助設計者在未來設計三維晶片時可利用自動化的技術即可完成電路的佈
局與繞線的規劃。而透過穿矽連接孔傳遞訊號的三維晶片，不僅傳遞一般控制訊號，也將傳送
時脈訊號，這代表著一個時脈訊號源當傳送到不同層晶片時，仍然需要確保彼此的時脈訊號沒
有相位誤差。因此一套適用於多樓層晶片的時脈同步設計的校正機制也是我們研究的主要方
向。而在三維晶片中，由於層層相黏，熱的疏散只能透過穿矽連接孔至外層的空氣接觸面，這
可能導致散熱不及，造成潛在溫度過度上昇，引發故障。 
有鑑於此，本計畫將開發一套即時且連續溫度監控的設計，必要時調低電壓與運算效能，以避
免晶片過熱而發生永久性故障。 
測試與驗證階段: 
在三維晶片中，『穿矽連接孔』因是垂直連接孔，屬於較難製 
造的結構，良率通常較低，因此必須要特別加以測試，否則將來好幾個裸晶整合後若出現故障，
診斷上將會非常棘手。我們將開發低成本的電路設計用來擷取製造後的穿矽連接孔基本特性
值，此擷取出的晶片資料將有助於提升在設計階段的預測成功性。

(3) 目前依照計畫目標進行，先期評估將先以2D 實驗為主，因現今尚無學界可供3D 驗證的
平台。 
(4) 由於之前欠缺三維晶片製程的資源，故電路及構想難以驗證，但目前因與工研院的合作關
係因此可以取得所需的TSV 電氣特性的模型資源。

5µ m and 5µ m to 50_m [1]  of via-first and via- 
last  respectively. The silicon area of TSVs is non- 
negligible.The TSVs can facilitate our congestion 
and reduce wirelength, but the benefits could be 
vanished if  the posit ions of TSVs are not  well- 
placed.

design. Various 3D floorplanners were proposed in 
recent  yea rs  [ 2] ,  [11] ,  [ 12] ,  [ 14] .  Cong e t  a l . 
[14] proposed a thermal-driven floorplanner using 
the CBA representation and SA optimization engine. 
Li  e t al .  [12]  performed the interlayer part i tion 
and optimize the wirelength simultaneously, then 
use SA optimization engine with CBL representation. 
A fixed-outline thermal-aware floorplanner [2] was 
proposed, which also used SA optimization engine and 
proposed a efficiency interpolation based thermal 
profiling. 
However, none of these approaches consider the 
signal TSV position during floorplan stage. Most 
of the previous 3D floorplaners [12], [11],  [14], 
[22] do not consider the fixed outline constraint. 
If  t he range of  aspect  ra t io of  each layers  are 
wide, it would create a huge chip area and produce 
a lot of whitespace in each dies. To my knowledge, 
many 3D floorplaners [2], [11], [12], [14]  adopt 
the SA for their  optimization engine. It  is time- 
consuming especially in large solution space and 
can 't  grantee the  solution quali ty in each runs. 
Kim et al.[5] suggest the TSV coplacement strategy 
and the size of TSVs is assumed 2.47 µ m x 2.47 
µ m using via-f irs t technology.  The experimental 
results show area overhead is 15% ~ 30%. If the 
via-last technology employed, the size of TSVs would 
be larger than the standard cells and manufactures 
also prefer to fabricate larger TSVs because of the 
yield[3]. The wirelengtth estimation with the TSV 
position is quite larger than without TSV ones shown 
on our experimental result, so we suggest the TSV 
 
 
cofloorplan strategy. 
The rest of this project is organized as follows.

III. 已完成進度 
A. Problem Definition 
 
All symbols uesed in following content are introduced 
a b o v e .  G i v e n  a  s e t  o f  b l o c k s  w i t h  l a y e r 
assignment informat ion ,  a  set  of  ne ts which i s 
the interconnection of the blocks, the number of 
layer in the 3D IC, the width and height of the 
fixed-outline. Our objective is minimize the total 
wirelength with the signal TSV satisfying the fixed- 
outline constraint.  The posit ions of each blocks i 
denote (xi; yi; zi). If the zi of blocksi equals to the 
zj of blocksj , the blocksi and blocksj can not overlap 
in layer zi .  The objective function is summation 
the half-parameter wirelength(HPWL) of each layer 
as Eq 1. 
8 
and the global layout of each layers is corresponding 
to a slicing tree. The modules would be partitioned 
to each region according to the estimated HPWL. 
The HPWL estimation model is derive from the exact 
 
 
net weight model [13] to accurately evaluate the 
wirelength during partitioning. The interconnection 
length wi thin individua l  layer  is de termined by 
the pins on current layer and the interconnection 
length across different layers (RDL wirelength) is 
determined by the TSVs on adjacent layers and pins 
on current layer.  In the exact net weight model, 
three cases are involved,  al l  of  the objects  are 
in  le f t  s ide  as  Fig.  5(a) ,  a l l  of  the  ob jec ts  in 
right side as Fig. 5(b) or the objects are in the 
both s ide Fig.  5(c) .  The objects  on layer  k are 
only attracted by the fixed TSVs, so the HPWL is 
calculated by the pins on layer k, the TSV on layer 
k+1 and layer k-1. The min-cut objective can be 
transformed to the HPWL objective by this model. 
The  min-cut  par t i t i one r  [ 15]  i s  appl ied on the 
hypergraph to minimize the interconnection length 
under the balance constraint. The pseudo coed of 
global layout determination i s shown on Fig.  6. 
Ini t ia l ize  the  posi t ion of  modules  to cente r  of 
chip and the while loop continues until the number 
of objects(TSVs and modules) in all leaves are small 
than maxN(default=10). The two for-loops control the 
partition process in round robin fashion. In order 
to balance the number of TSVs and area of modules, 
the first hypergraph HG in line 9 is created and the 
area of TSVs are set to zero. The area of modules 
is ba lanced in the f ir s t  bipar t i t ion process  and 
the TSVs are also well-placed into each subregion. 
If the numbers of TSVs in the two subpart itions 
 
 
 
 
a r e  n ot  s a t i s f yi n g  t he  ba l a nce  c on s t r a i n t ,  t he 
second bipartition process would be applied on the 
hypergraph HGTSV which constructed by assuming the 
pre-placed modules are fixed. 
F. Local Enumerative Packing 
After the global layouts are determined, the local 
enumerative packing technique (EP) [9] is applied 
to explore effects of different local packings of 
subcircuit on the overall layout. The objective of 
EP is pack the modules and TSVs in a compact manner 
such that  the fina l layout will sat isfy the f ixed 
out l ine  for  al l  l ayers .  Al l  of  the subf loorplans 
in each subcircuit are captured in the shape curve 
of each leaves. The shape curves are generated by 
dynamic programming to get all slicing layouts of 
the modules and TSVs within each subcircuit. After 
the shape curves of leaves are constructed, the shape 
curve of internal nodes are bottom-up constructed 
until a shape curve for the root of the slicing tree 
is obtained for each layer. 
G. Subfloorplan Swapping and Mirroring 
The outline of subfloorplans is not changed by 
Swapping and Mirroring and the operations may 
shorten the wirelength of each subfloorplan, so it is 
applied to each subfloorplan in greedy way. For each 
10 
breaks down the traditional wirelength optimization 
restrict ion on slicing trees. With the progression 
 
 
 
of 3D technology, the demand of 3D EDA tool is 
urgent.  Our research provides a viable approach 
to handle TSVs at floorplaning stage. Finally, two 
paper have been published [17], [18] this year under 
support of this research grant.

一﹑中文摘要 
在本子計畫中，我們將研究以TSV（Through-Silicon Via）
連接晶片間訊號的 3D IC 繞線問題。將多個元件層垂直疊
合的 3D IC 使繞線問題相較於 2D IC 來得更複雜，除了原
有 2D IC 繞線問題必須考慮的多重目標及限制(例如：繞
線的擁擠程度、繞線的長度、時序)外，3D IC 繞線尚必須
考慮幾個特定問題。首先，散熱的問題對於 2D IC 的效能
及可靠度已是一個重要的影響因素，但由於 3D IC 將元件
包的更密，造成功耗密度更高，且層與層間有高熱阻的絕
緣層隔絕，使得散熱對 3D IC 而言是一個更嚴重的問題；
所以溫度的問題必須在繞線時同時去考慮。第二，TSV
將被置於功能方塊間的剩餘空間，因此是數量有限的珍貴
資源，應有效地被運用於繞線及降溫上。第三，訊號延遲
隨者導線溫度提升而增加，所以訊號線（尤其是影響時序
的訊號線）應避免經過高溫的區域。 
就我們所知，學術界在 3D IC 繞線問題的相關研究成果
並不多，因此這個領域離成熟階段尚有一段距離，更不用
說 EDA 業界主要的公司仍未有任何的 3D IC 繞線工具上
市。由於溫度的影響對於 3D IC 的設計是一個重要的挑
戰，因此在本子計畫中，我們將對具溫度意識的 3D IC 繞
線問題進行研究。為了降低問題的複雜度，我們將採用常
見的兩階段式繞線方法來解決，即經由全域繞線後再施以
細部繞線。 針對全域繞線及細部繞線問題，我們將研發
快速、有效的方法及自動化工具，並將這些工具整合成一
套 3D IC 繞線系統。 
本子計畫第一年是研究 3D IC 全域繞線問題。對於不同
的 TSV 製造技術，我們針對 via first 的 TSV 研發一個 3D 
IC 全域繞線器，實驗結果顯示，與現有 2D IC 繞線器相
較，我們的 3D IC 全域繞線器能有效地縮短繞線長度。 
此外，我們亦研究溫度對 IC 可靠度的影響。由於大多
現有的 2D IC 全域繞線器只能針對繞線的擁擠程度及長
度做處理，因此我們開發一個可降低溫度對 2D IC 可靠度
造成衝擊的全域繞線器，此繞線器可將繞線線段有效地避
開溫度較高之區域進而降低線路因高溫而斷路的可能
性。最後，此具溫度意識的 2D IC 全域繞線方法已被成功
地整合到我們的 3D IC 全域繞線方法內，使得我們的繞線
器進一步地成為一個具溫度意識的 3D IC 全域繞線器。

Abstract 
  In  t h i s  s ub pr o jec t ,  we  s h a l l  i nve s t i ga t e  t he 
r ou t i n g  p r ob l e m  f or  3 - d i me n s i o n a l  i n t e gr a t ed  
circui ts (3D ICs)  that  use  Through-Sil icon Vias  
( T S V s )  a s  v e h i c l e s  f o r  i n t e r - l a y e r  
in terconnec t ions.  The  s t ruc ture of  the  mul t ip le  
device layers of  a  3D IC has made the routing  
problem more complex than its counterpart  in a  
2D IC. In addition to ptimizing/satisfying traditional multiple 
objectives/constraints, e.g., congestion, wirelength, and 
timing, like 2D IC routing does, 3D IC routing needs to take 
several specific issues into account. First, heat dissipation, 
which has already been an important factor to affect the 
performance and reliability of a 2D IC, is now aggravated in 
a 3D IC because the devices are more packed to cause higher 
power densities and the insulating dielectric layers between 
the device layers have much lower thermal conductivities 
than silicon. As a result, the thermal issue must be addressed 
during routing. Second, TSVs, which are positioned at white 
space between functional blocks and thus have a limited 
amount, are valuable resources that should be effectively 
utilized by a router for both routing and temperature 
reduction. Third, the delay of a wire increases with its 
temperature and therefore a wire (especially a timing-critical 
one) should avoid passing through regions of higher 
temperatures.   
  To the best of our knowledge, only a few academic 
research results in 3D IC routing scatter in the literature, and 
therefore this area is still far from maturity, not to mention 
that no related commercial tool from major EDA vendors has 
been delivered to the market yet. Since thermal is one of the 
most important and challenging issues in 3D IC design, we 
shall investigate the thermal-aware 3D IC routing problem in 
this subproject. To reduce the problem complexity, we shall 
adopt the popular two-stage routing approach, i.e., global 
routing followed by detailed routing, to tackle this problem. 
We shall research and develop robust algorithms and CAD 
tools for global routing and detailed routing, and integrate 
the tools into a thermal-aware 3D IC routing system.   
  For the first year of this subproject, we have focused on 
3D IC global routing. Among several different types of 
manufacturing processes for TSVs, we have developed a 3D 
IC global router for via-first TSVs. The experimental results 
show that our global router could effectively reduce the total 
wirelength as compared with a state-of-the-art 2D IC global 
router.  
  In addition, we have studied the impact of temperature on 
14  
determine the location of each block assigned to the device 
layer [37-39]. The solution space considered by this type of 
approach is much smaller, but to produce a solution of 
satisfactory quality, a good partitioner is required. 
The works in [30,40] expands the floorplanning/placement 
problem by integrating thermal TSV insertion. Given a 
floorplan/placement result, the work in [41] present linear 
programming (LP) based method to redistribute white space 
for better thermal via planning, while iterative methods are 
proposed in [42,43] to effectively insert thermal TSVs to the 
floorplan/placement result. 
6. Previous Works on Routing 
The structure of the multiple device layers of a 3D IC has 
made the routing problem more complex than its counterpart 
in a 2D IC. In addition to optimizing/satisfying traditional 
multiple objectives/constraints, e.g., congestion, wirelength, 
and timing, like 2D IC routing does, 3D IC routing needs to 
take several specific issues into account. First, heat 
dissipation, which has already been an important factor to 
affect the performance and reliability of a 2D IC, is now 
aggravated in a 3D IC because the devices are more packed 
to cause higher power densities and the insulating dielectric 
layers between the device layers have much lower thermal 
conductivities than silicon. As a result, the thermal issue 
must be addressed during routing. Second, TSVs, which are 
positioned at white space between functional blocks (see 
Figure 1) and thus have a limited amount, are valuable 
resources that should be effectively utilized by a router for 
both routing and temperature reduction. Third, the delay of a 
wire increases with its temperature and therefore a wire 
(especially a timing-critical one) should avoid passing 
through regions of higher temperatures.  As shown in 
Figure 1, a 3D IC has several metal routing layers in a device 
layer. Depending on the TSV technology, usually inter-block 
connections can be realized by only the top few routing 
layers. In addition, wires on different device layers can be 
connected only by TSVs which are located at white space 
between functional blocks. Furthermore, the existence of 
large obstacles in device layers may cause a 3D router to 
produce longer detours for nets that have pins located at 
several device layers.  
As compared to floorplanning/placement, only a few 
research results in 3D IC routing that consider the thermal 
issue have been published [44-47]. Furthermore, these works 
are all for global routing; conceptually their ideas can be also 
applied to detailed routing, but whether they can be scalable 
to a detailed routing problem is questionable because a 
detailed routing graph with finer granularity usually has a 
much larger size than a global routing graph, plus there is no 
empirical results ever provided for running them as a 
detailed router. It is also worth mentioning that although the 
authors in [44,45] used a grid-based detailed router (after 
global routing was done) to produce the final routing result, 
unfortunately no detail of this grid-based detailed router was 
revealed. 
 
The work in [44] presents a thermal-driven global router, 
which extends the authors’ previous 2D multilevel routing 
paradigm [48] to combine with thermal TSV insertion. At the 
coarsest level, an initial routing solution is constructed by 
building a 3D Steiner tree for each net using the 
minimum-spanning-tree (MST) and point-to-path maze 
routing techniques. Then the total amount of thermal TSVs 
that need to be inserted is estimated, and these thermal TSVs 
are distributed to routing grid cells based on some 
temperature measurement. At each uncoarsening level, TSVs 
(including both signal and thermal ones) are distributed to 
finer grid cells (using the same idea in the coarsest level) and 
then each signal TSV is assigned to a finer grid cells using 
wirelength as the cost function (this is done by formulating 
the problem as a min-cot flow problem). The remaining 
TSVs in a grid cell become the thermal TSVs assigned to 
that grid cell. In addition, because the amount of thermal 
TSVs is estimated by a very simple method, the required 
temperature may not be achieved after a TSV planning step. 
Therefore, the amount of TSVs will be adjusted after each 
TSV planning step. Figure 2 gives an overall flow of this 
thermal-driven 3D global router, where a compact thermal 
model proposed in [17] is used for the temperature 
calculation. This work, however, did not mention how to 
perform wire refinement (i.e., how to reconstruct the routing 
for each net after the locations of its signal TSVs are fixed) 
at each uncoarsening level. In addition, whether a 
rip-up-and-reroute scheme is required to resolve wire or via 
congestion is not clear. Furthermore, according to the 
experimental results, the majority of the test cases did not 
meet the temperature requirement, but why this happened 
was not discussed. 
The same authors of [44] later proposed a better thermal 
TSV insertion method to further reduce the amount of 
required thermal TSVs. They developed a heuristic algorithm, 
which solves a sequence of simplified TSV insertion 
subproblems in alternating directions (i.e., vertical direction 
first, followed by horizontal direction) within the multilevel 
framework. The TSV distribution in the vertical direction is 
formulated as a convex programming problem, and the 
horizontal TSV insertion problem is based on two effective 
ideas: path counting and heat propagation. Although the 
experimental results show that much less thermal TSVs are 
inserted compared to those produced by the previous method, 
the majority of the test cases did not have 100% routing 
completion rate after detailed routing; as a result, this 
enhanced router still leaves room for improvement. 
Another algorithm for 3D thermal-aware global, presented 
in [46], considers the routing problem which allows to insert 
thermal TSVs in the vertical direction and thermal wires in 
the routing layers. Like a thermal TSV, a thermal wire has no

the one in [44-46], so as to consider overflow, wirelength and 
temperature at the same time. Furthermore, since TSVs are 
expensive to fabricate and large amounts of TSVs will 
degrade the yield and reliability of a 3D IC, the total number 
of TSVs in a design should be as small as possible.  
 In this subproject, we shall research and develop robust 
algorithms and CAD tools for thermal-aware global routing 
in the first year and then switch the focus to thermal-aware 
detailed routing in the second year. We shall also integrate all 
the routing tools into a thermal-aware 3D IC routing system 
at the time when this subproject is completed.   
 
三﹑研究方法 
  During the first year, we have studied three global routing 
problems and developed robust solutions. 
Problem 1: Global Routing for 3D ICs. The problem 
specifies a routing grid graph for each die in a 3D IC. Each 
vertex in the grid graph corresponds to a global bin on a 
metal layer, while each edge corresponds to a  boundary 
between two global bins on the same metal layer, or 
corresponds to vias connecting two global bins on adjacent 
metal layers. Each boundary edge is associated with a wire 
capacity which specifies the number of nets that can pass 
through the boundary without inducing any overflow. There 
is also a set of un-routed nets, where each net is composed of 
a set of pins that can be distributed on different dies and/or 
different metal layers. Each pin of a net corresponds to a 
vertex in a grid graph. For each die, its device layer is also 
partitioning into a set of global regions, where each region 
has the same dimensions as those of a global bin on a metal 
layer and is associated with a TSV capacity which specifies 
the amount of signal TSVs that can be inserted in the region. 
This  routing problem asks to find a route for each net using 
edges of grid graphs and TSVs such that the total overflow 
of all boundary edges and the total wirelength of all nets are 
minimized while no TSV capacity constraint is violated. We 
adopt via-first TSVs and assume that each TSV penetrates 
the associated die from the device layer up to the lowest 
metal layer (i.e., M1 layer) and in the meantime touches the 
highest metal layer of the die that is immediately below the 
associated die.   
Solution: For Problem 1 we have developed a robust 
algorithm to solve it. The major ideas of our algorithm are 
described below.  
  We decompose Problem 1 into two sub-problems: the 
signal TSV assignment problem followed by the general 2D 
IC global routing problem. According to the via-first 
technology, inserting a signal TSV into a net will induce two 
pins; one is located on M1 layer and the other is located on 
the top metal layer of the die that is immediately below the 
associated die. The more signal TSVs are assigned, the more 
routing resources are consumed. Therefore our algorithm 
uses the fewest number of signal TSVs for each net and 
places them to connect the pins distributed on different dies. 
The TSV assignment problem is solved in a die-by-die 
manner, and each subproblem asks to find a TSV assignment 
for a die such that no TSV capacity constraint is violated and 
the total wirelength of all the nets on the die is minimized. 
Here the wirelength of a net on a die is calculated by the half 
perimeter of the minimum bouding box that enlcoses the pins 
and the assigned TSV of the net on the die. Each subproblem 
is solved optimially by formulating it as a min-cost flow 
problem. After the TSV assignment problem is solved, the 
remaining problem becomes to perform 2D IC global routing 
for each die. To do this, a state-of-the-art 2D IC global router  
NTHU-Route 2.0 [50], that was previously developed by our 
research group, is applied.  NTHU-Ropute 2.0 is good at 
minimizing both the total overflow and the total wirelength 
of each die.  
Problem 2: Thermal-aware Global Routing for 2D ICs. 
The problem gives a routing grid graph for a given 2D IC. 
There are also a set of un-routed nets and a thermal profile. 
The thermal profile provides the temperature information of 
each global bin. This routing problem asks to find a route for 
each net using edges of the grid graph. Meanwhile, the 
amount of routed net segments that are located in hot spots 
(#WSIHS) should be as small as possible. A hot spot is a 
global bin that has a higher temperature, and we assume that 
the set of hot spots is also given by this routing problem.  
Solution: For Poblem 2, we have extended NTHU-Route 
2.0 to develop an effective algorithm to solve it. The major 
ideas are described below. 
  We incorporat a thermal-aware L-shaped pattern routing 
method and two thermal-aware cost functions into 
NTHU-Route 2.0 to get our therma-aware 2D IC global 
router. The thermal-aware L-shaped pattern routing method 
helps NTHU-Route 2.0 to reduce #WSIHS when generating 
the initial routing solution. After then, the two thermal-aware 
cost functions guide NTHU-Route 2.0 to avoid routing nets 
over  hot spots when the router applies an iterative rip-up 
and reroute technique to improve the solution quality. As a 
results, these developed thermal-aware routing methods are 
able to prolong the mean time to failure of 2D ICs and hence 
improve their reliability. 
Problem 3: Thermal-aware Global Routing for 3D ICs. 
This problem extends Problem 1 to consider the thermal 
issue. There is a set of thermal profiles for all dies of a 3D IC, 
which provides the temperature information of the global 
bins. In addition to minimizing the total overflow and the 
total wirelength, this routing problem also asks to minimize 
the total amount of nets segments located in the hot spots 
(#WSIHS), subject to the TSV capacity constraints. 
Solution: For Poblem 3, we have extended our 3D IC 
global router of problem 1 by replacing its 2D IC router with 
our thermal-aware global routing algorithm of Problem 2 to 
get a 3D IC thermal-aware global router. 
 
四﹑結果與討論 
  We have implemented all our global routers in C++ 
language. All experiments were conducted on a Linux 
workstation with an Intel Xeon 3.0 GHz CPU and 64G 
memory. 
Problem 1: We compare our 3D IC global router with 
NTHU-Route 2.0 (which is a 2D IC global router). All the 
test cases for our 3D IC global router were generated from 
the ISPD98 benchmarks, which were originally released for 
2D IC global routing, by using a die-folding method that is 
similar to the folding-2 approach [36]. The experimental 
results are shown in Table 1, where each 3D IC test case 
consists of 4 dies. The term “WS” in Table 1 denotes the

前言 、研究目的 、文獻探討 
Three-dimensional (3D) IC has recently regained attention as 
a potential future system solution featuring high performance 
[1], [2], low-power [3], high density, and heterogeneous 
integrations. Fig. 1 shows some examples of 3D IC 
applications from processors [4] to heterogeneous designs. 
Among various 3D stacking approaches [5], TSV 
(through-silicon-via) technology is very attractive in terms of 
connection performance, design overheads and fabrication 
costs [6]. In this project, we focus on the research of 3D ICs 
using multiple device layers stacking with TSV technologies. 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1 Examples of 3D ICs: (a) CPU (b) Flash-based processors (c) 
network-on-chip and (d) heterogeneous designs 
 
 
 
The regular structure and long wires in a large-capacity 
memory make it one of the best candidates for 3D designs 
[7], [2].Thus, 3D Memories [8]-[16], is one of the key topics 
in recent 3D IC research since memories are essential 
devices in 3D ICs (see Fig. 1) as well as in conventional 2D 
ICs. Furthermore, using 3D memories enable better system 
performance by having wider bandwidth, lower interconnect 
power consumption [17], and lower cost of using several 
memory types (i.e. SRAM+DRAM+Flash). Some research 
focus on the single-crystal solution (Fig. 2) for 3D memories 
to reach maximum cost reduction with specialized process 
[10], [11], [18]. Many researches employ multiple device 
layers, which each layer can be manufactured by 
conventional 2D IC processes (Fig. 3), and various stacking 
technologies for cost-effective heterogeneous 3D ICs.

In nanometer technologies, on-chip SRAM devices 
usually consume significant leakage current for a chip. 
Unfortunately, high temperature increases the SRAM 
leakage current significantly. Fig. 6 shows the measured 
leakage current of a 0.18um 512Kb SRAM in our previous 
research. Though conventional sleep-transistor or gated 
ground schemes [26]-[36] have consistent leakage reduction 
ratios for SRAM, the actual SRAM leakage current at high 
temperature is still too large (20X~25X). Unfortunately, the 
high-temperature induced large SRAM leakage current is 
server because the thermal effect in 3D ICs is worse than in 
2D ICs [23], [25]. In a 3D IC system, several SRAM cell 
arrays may be operated in different temperatures and voltage 
conditions across various time-points, placed locations and 
layers. Thus, a common setting for leakage control is not 
suitable for SRAM devices in a 3D IC system, especially for 
the 3D-distributed memory structure. Thus, an independent 
thermal-aware leakage suppression control for each SRAM 
cell array is needed for 3D ICs.
