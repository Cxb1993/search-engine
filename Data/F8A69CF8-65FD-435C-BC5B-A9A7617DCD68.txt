With the advance of broadband wireless access technologies,
the emerging wireless relay networks (WRNs) are expected to
provide significant improvement on throughput and extension
of coverage area for next-generation wireless systems. As real-
time applications (e.g., voice over IP and video streaming)
rapidly grow, provisioning quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee
to these applications is one of the most important issues for
WRNs. In WRNs, contention-based medium access control
(MAC) protocols, such as IEEE 802.11, are hard to quantita-
tively guarantee QoS due to its unpredictable and uncontrollable
packet collisions. Compared to the contention-based MAC
protocols, polling-based channel access (e.g., IEEE 802.16) can
provide fine-granularity resource management. Moreover, the
centralized control provided by base stations (BSs) facilitates
the feasibility of QoS provisioning to these real-time applica-
tions.
Recently, IEEE 802.16j task group has been devoted to
develop a multi-hop relay mode for IEEE 802.16 point-to-
multi-point networks. The increasing system throughput and
coverage area through low-cost IEEE 802.16j relay stations
(RSs) accelerate the deployment of real-time applications over
broadband wireless networks. Figure 1 depicts an example of
IEEE 802.16j-based network, where the solid and dashed lines
represent the wired and wireless connections, respectively. In
this figure, an access service network (ASN) consists of an
ASN gateway and several WRNs. The ASN gateway connects
to a connectivity service network (CSN) through an Internet
service provider (ISP) backbone network. The CSN supports
authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) function-
ality and provides various kinds of wireless applications to
subscribers. The CSN also communicates with the Internet via
an interworking gateway. Note that an IP multimedia subsystem
(IMS) can be located in the CSN or connect to the CSN through
the interworking gateway. In a WRN, a subscriber station (SS)
can either connect to its serving BS directly or communicate
with the BS via one or more RSs with multi-hop transmission.
A BS coordinates the SSs and RSs in its coverage area, and
handles resource allocation for the service flows of SSs. To
alleviate the operational complexity of a BS, the number of RSs
and the maximum number of hop counts are usually small [1].
In IEEE 802.16j, the deployment of one-hop relay is mandatory,
while the multi-hop relay is optionally implemented.
Although the communication protocols of resource allocation
for IEEE 802.16 networks have been specified in [2], the design
of resource allocation policies is still an open issue. Without an
appropriate allocation policy, some critical service flows might
suffer from the lack of available bandwidth, and the service
quality of these flows cannot be guaranteed. In the past decades,
many excellent scheduling algorithms with QoS guarantee have
been proposed for the provision of real-time applications in
wired networks, e.g., [3], [4], [5]. Providing QoS guarantee in
wireless networks, however, is complicated by the existence of
signal interference.
The resource allocation issue is referred to as the link
scheduling problem in wireless multihop networks and many
interference-aware link scheduling algorithms have been de-

veloped for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and wireless
mesh networks (WMNs). In [6], the problem has been proven
to be NP-hard for a multi-hop wireless network. Based on [6],
several heuristic algorithms were presented to handle multi-
hop link scheduling for throughput improvement [7], [8], [9],
[10]. Furthermore, some approximation algorithms with worst-
case performance bounds were developed for multi-hop link
scheduling [11], [12], [13], [14].
In addition to the consideration of best-effort traffic for multi-
hop link scheduling, the QoS issue for resource allocation was
studied in MANETs and WMNs. Tang et al. [15] proposed
a mechanism of interference-aware topology control and QoS
routing for multi-channel WMNs. This mechanism ensures that
all data deliveries are satisfied with their allocated bandwidth.
In [16], an approximation algorithm with a worst-case bound
was proposed to provide a hard bandwidth guarantee for
MANET users. Unfortunately, both of the studies can not
provide a delay guarantee for real-time applications. In [17],
a link scheduler was presented to minimize the maximal delay
of requests for a TDMA-based multi-hop network by adopting
the spatial-reuse technique. However, this is not a feasible
solution in the networks using a protocol such as IEEE 802.16
where a guarantee (instead of minimization) of explicit delay
bound must be achieved for each service flow [2]. Lee et
al. [18] presented a pioneering work for interference-aware
routing such that both the bandwidth and delay of each service
flow can be deterministically guaranteed for multi-hop wireless
backhaul networks. However, the design of link scheduler was
not addressed in this work.
In this project, we study an optimization problem for
interference-aware link scheduling with QoS guarantee over
WRNs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of
very first attempts at the studying of interference-aware link
scheduling problem based on explicit bandwidth and delay
requirements of WRNs. The contributions of this work are
described as follows.
• Explicit QoS guarantee: We present efficient link
scheduling algorithms to provide bandwidth and delay
guarantees for WRNs over arbitrary routing.

For brevity, we use the following abbreviations in the rest of
this project. “For i ∈ F” represents “for each flow Fi ∈ F”. “For
(i, j) ∈ T” signifies “for each flow Fi ∈ F and its transmission
Ti, j ∈ Ti”. “For (i, j , j′) ∈ T” indicates “for each flow Fi ∈ F
and for two different transmissions T i, j, Ti, j′ ∈ Ti”. “For (i ,
i′, j , j′) ∈ T” expresses “for two different flows Fi, Fi′ ∈ F
and for two different transmissions T i, j ∈ Ti and Ti′, j′ ∈ Ti′”.
For (i, j) ∈ T, its interference list Ii, j is a set of wireless links
that could interfere with link (T Xi, j,RXi, j). In the literature, con-
siderable interference models have been studied for MANETs
and WMNs, e.g., fixed-radius interference model [15], fixed
power protocol model, and RTS/CTS model [12]. These models
might not be suitable for our study because different types of
stations in a WRN may lead to different physical capabilities of
their antennae. For example, a BS could support the multi-user
adaptive antenna system (AAS) technique to provide multi-
beam adaptive beamforming and null-steering [22]. An RS
could use a directional or sectorized antenna to improve signal
strength [23]. A low-cost RS [23] or SS could possibly be
equipped with an omnidirectional antenna. Because various an-
tennas could be adopted by different stations, we shall consider
a more general interference model.
Our interference model adopts the protocol model which
considers both primary interference and secondary interfer-
ence [24]. Primary interference, denoted by Ui, j, occurs when
a station transmits to and/or receives from different stations
at the same time, i.e., Ui, j = {(α, β) ∈ E | α = T Xi, j or α =
RXi, j or β = T Xi, j or β = RXi, j}. Secondary interference,
denoted by S i, j, occurs when a receiving station interferes with
transmissions intended for another station, i.e., S i, j ⊆ E. In
other words, only adjacent links would incur primary interfer-
ence while the secondary interference of a transmission comes
from some links with two hops away from the transmission.
In our model, the secondary interference of a transmission can
not just determined by a fixed radius/power, and shall be a set
of arbitrary wireless links depending on the characteristic of
its transmitting station. The interference among transmissions
considered in this project is thus Ii, j = Ui, j ∪ S i, j, for (i, j) ∈ T.
A schedule is an assignment of the transmissions of the
selected flows for a frame to some time intervals. To be more
specific, we select a subset of flows Fˆ ⊆ F for a frame and
1. We assume that a BS is aware of the transmission rate of each link.
The link rate is determined by the transmission power, modulation and coding
scheme [21].
then assign the jth transmission of flow i ∈ Fˆ to a time interval
[ ˆ`i, j, ˆ`i, j + τi, j), for (i, j) ∈ Tˆ. For the rest of this project, we
call Fˆ a schedule for the sake of simplicity when there is no
ambiguity. A schedule Fˆ is feasible if it satisfies all of the
constraints defined as follows.
Denition 1 (Transmission Constraint). A schedule Fˆ satises
the transmission constraint if and only if the transmissions of
any service ow in the schedule 1) follow a strict order and 2)
meet the deadline and the frame boundary, i.e., for (i, j) ∈ Tˆ,
each schedule instance ˆ`i, j is bounded by
ˆ`i, j ≤
{ ˆ`i, j+1 − τi, j, 1 ≤ j ≤ κi − 1
min{di, c} − τi, j, j = κi (2)
Denition 2. Let Tˆi, j ⇔ Tˆi′, j′ (Tˆi, j < Tˆi′, j′ ) represent Tˆi, j and
Tˆi′, j′ are (not) overlapped with each other. The transmissions
Tˆi, j and Tˆi′, j′ are not overlapped if and only if the time intervals
[ ˆ`i, j, ˆ`i, j + τi, j) and [ ˆ`i′, j′ , ˆ`i′, j′ + τi′ , j′) are disjoint.
Denition 3 (Interference-free Constraint). Let Tˆi, j  Tˆi′ , j′
denote that the transmission link of Tˆi, j interferes with that
of Tˆi′ , j′ , i.e., (T Xi′, j′ ,RXi′, j′) ∈ Ii, j. Then a schedule Fˆ satises
the interference-free constraint if and only if Tˆi, j < Tˆi′ , j′ for
(i , i′, j , j′) ∈ Tˆ, Tˆi, j  Tˆi′, j′
Denition 4. A schedule Fˆ of service ow set F is considered
feasible if the schedule includes all admitted ows in F and
meets both the transmission and interference-free constraints.
In this project, we are interested in the derivation of a feasible
schedule for OPT-LS such that the schedule profit in a frame is
maximized.
Denition 5. The prot Γ(Fˆ) of a schedule Fˆ is dened as the
summation of the weights of the scheduled ows, i.e.,
Γ(Fˆ) =
∑
i∈ F
wi (3)
Note that the weight in our problem can be a general
performance measure depending on the practical requirements
of WRN service providers. For example, if the weight is set
as a bandwidth requirement, the problem is to maximize the
system throughput.
Denition 6. An optimal schedule F˜ is dened as a feasible
schedule such that Γ(F˜) is maximized for a given ow set F.
Denition 7. A scheduling algorithm for OPT-LS is with an
h-approximation factor if the prot of its derived schedule Fˆ
3
is set as an arbitrary positive constant ~ and that of the last
transmission is set as an arbitrary value =, where 0 < = < ~
|Vc |
.
That is, τi, j = ~ for 1 ≤ j ≤ κi − 1 and τi,κi = =. Let the
deadline di = (κi − 1)~+ |Vc|= and weight wi = 1. The first and
last transmissions are assigned to link (si, ri,1) and (ri,κi−1, BS ),
respectively. For the rest, the jth transmission is assigned to link
(ri, j−1, ri, j). The route assignment for the example is also shown
in Figure 3(c). Assume there is only primary interference, which
occurs when a station transmits to and/or receives from different
stations at the same time. We now perform an RS merging
process such that two service flows can be selected into a
feasible schedule if and only if there is no edge between the
corresponding vertices in Gc: For the first transmissions of the
flows in F, we select an arbitrary edge (vi, vi′) in Gc that has not
been selected, and merge the two relay stations ri,1 and ri′ ,1. It
implies that we cannot select both of Fi and Fi′ into a feasible
schedule. Otherwise, T i,1 may interfere with Ti′,1 if Tˆi,1 ⇔ Tˆi′,1,
or at least one of the two flows will miss its deadline if
Tˆi,1 < Tˆi′,1. The same merging action is also performed for
the jth transmissions of the flows, for j = 2, 3, ..., |Ec|, resulting
in an input instance for OPT-LS (refer to Figure 3(d)).
Now we shall show that Gc has a maximum clique of u
vertices if and only if F has an optimal schedule F˜ with profit
Γ(F˜) = u. Suppose that such a maximum clique V∗c exists and
|V∗c | = u. By the reduction, V∗c corresponds to a subset F∗ ∈ F
of u service flows. We can obtain a feasible schedule F∗ for F
by assigning each schedule instance as follows.
1) For the first κi − 1 transmissions T ∗i, j (1 ≤ i ≤ u, 1 ≤ j ≤
κi − 1), let `∗i, j = ( j − 1) × ~.
2) For the last transmission T ∗i,κi (1 ≤ i ≤ u), let `
∗
i,κi
=
(κi − 1) × ~ + (i − 1) × =.
Now suppose for a contradiction that F∗ is not optimal, i.e., a
feasible schedule Fˆ with u′ > u flows exists. Then there must
be no edge between any pair of the u′ corresponding vertices
in G, in the sense that Gc contains an independent set with
u′ vertices, and Gc has a clique of size u′ > u. We reach a
contradiction. With similar argument, the other direction can
be proved.
Theorem 1. No polynomial-time algorithm can approximate
OPT-LS within a factor of n1− for any  > 0, unless NP ⊆
ZPP2.
Proof: We show the inapproximability of OPT-LS by an
L-reduction from MAX CLIQUE. L-reduction is a transformation
which preserves a relative error of approximation within a con-
stant factor [27]. Suppose that both Π and Π′ are maximization
problems. Π can be L-reduced to Π′ if there exist two constants
ϑ1, ϑ2 > 0 and a polynomial-time transformation f satisfies the
following conditions:
1) For each instance x of Π, f (x) is an instance of Π′.
2) The optimum solutions of x and f (x), OPT (x) and
OPT ( f (x)), satisfy OPT ( f (x)) ≤ ϑ1 × OPT (x).
3) For any solution of f (x), sol( f (x)), we can find in poly-
nomial time a solution of x, sol(x), satisfying sol(x) ≥
2. ZPP (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time) is a complexity class
defined based on probabilistic Turing machines. Interested readers are referred
to [26] for further details.

OPT (x) + ϑ2[sol( f (x)) − OPT ( f (x))].
In our reduction, the optimum value of the two instances
is the same. Let ϑ1 = ϑ2 = 1, we have an L-reduction
from MAX CLIQUE to the special case of OPT-LS. Then by
the known result of inapproximability of MAX CLIQUE [28],
OPT-LS cannot be approximated within n1− in polynomial time
for any  > 0, where n is the number of service flows.

time service flows, and shall be shared with other types of
data transmission such as best-effort traffic and signaling control

3.2 Algorithm DPS-SR
Based on Algorithm DPS, we further pursue a feasible schedule
with a higher degree of spatial reuse. The heuristic, named
DPS-SR, is an amendment of DPS. Recall that in DPS, the
schedule sequence is determined by Equation (5), and the
transmission of the selected flows are proceed exclusively.
Allowing multiple transmissions to proceed simultaneously
would enhance the schedule profit. To achieve a higher degree
of spatial reuse, each transmission could be scheduled “as
early as possible” while the transmission and interference-free
constraints remain satisfied.
For any i,m (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ m ≤
∑
i∈F wi), let ξ(i,m) be
associated with a corresponding schedule Fˆ(i,m). DPS-SR is
DPSwith Pi+1 replaced by Qi+1,m, where Qi+1,m denotes the
increase of the completion time for inserting the κi+1 trans-
missions of Fi+1 into Fˆ(i,m − wi+1) while the transmission and
interference-free constraints remain satisfied. In other words,
each of the κi+1 transmissions is sequentially inserted into the
schedule at the earliest among the possible time instances.
Qi+1,m is the difference in completion time between the schedule
Fˆ(i,m − wi+1) and that with Fi+1 inserted. Then the resulting
schedule can be obtained by Fˆ(i,m∗), where m∗ is the maximum
value of all possible m such that ξ(i,m∗) < ∞.
Lemma 3. The schedule produced by Algorithm DPS-SR is a
feasible solution for OPT-LS.
Proof: The proof proceeds in the same way as that in
Lemma 2.
Theorem 3. The schedule prot derived by DPS-SR is no less
than that derived by DPS.
Proof: Since Qi,m ≤ Pi for each possible pair of (i,m), any
ξ(i,m) of Algorithm DPS-SR is less than or equal to ξ(i,m) of
Algorithm DPS. It implies that any schedule sequence produced
by Algorithm DPS is also a candidate sequence of Algorithm
DPS-SR.
Theorem 4. The time complexity of DPS-SR is O(n4ϕ2).
Proof: Instead of the constant computation time for Pi in
Equation (5), the computation of Qi,m in DPS-SR takes O(nϕ2)
time. In the worst case, solving Qi,m needs to make attempts to
insert ϕ transmissions into Fˆ(i−1,m−wi). Since Fˆ(i−1,m−wi)
has O(nϕ) scheduled transmissions in the worst case, each
attempt takes O(nϕ) time to derive the earliest schedule instance
for a transmission under the transmission and interference-
free constraints. The time complexity of the algorithm is thus
dominated by the running time of the second phase.
3.3 Worst Case Analysis of Algorithms
This section studies the worst-case performance of Algorithms
DPS and DPS-SR. As shown in Theorem 1, unless NP ⊆ ZPP,
the OPT-LS problem is not possible to have any approximation
algorithm with a factor better than n, where n denotes the
number of service flows and is usually large. An important
observation allows us to provide reasonable factors for approx-
imation algorithms is that the number of relay stations and the
maximum hop count in a WRN are usually small. The existing
usage scenarios of RS deployment in IEEE 802.16j are under
r ≤ 16 and ϕ ≤ 3 [30], [31], [32]. Thus, in this project we
are interested in deriving algorithms with approximation factors
relative to the network topology, instead of factors relative to
the system workload. We have to point out that the worst-
case performance of a WRN operated with our scheduling
algorithms is independent of the system workload in runtime
and determinable at the network planning stage.
In the following sections, we shall focus on analyzing the
approximation factor of Algorithm DPS. The derived approxi-
mation factor can also be applied to DPS-SR because, for any
input instance, the schedule profit of DPS-SR is at least equal
to that of DPS. The following two lemmas provide inspiration
for our worst-case analysis.
Lemma 4. Algorithm DPS produces the same prot for two
input instances if the only difference between them is their
interference lists.
Proof: Let us recall an important characteristic of Al-
gorithm DPS. To ensure that the interference-free constraint is
satisfied, Algorithm DPS pessimistically schedules at most one
transmission at any time instance, regardless of which links
are in the interference lists. It implies that Algorithm DPS will
produce the same profit for two input instances if the only
difference between them is the interference lists.
Lemma 5. Algorithm DPS produces the optimal prot for an
input instance where the concurrent transmissions for different
service ows are not allowed.
Proof: If the concurrent transmissions for different service
flows are not allowed, i.e., Ii, j = E for (i, j) ∈ T, the
service flows are referred to as single-machine jobs. Then the
OPT-LS problem can be reduced to the minimization of the
weighted number of tardy jobs on a single machine, and the
proof has been presented in [33].
Given an input instance F, let F(3) be the same as F, except
that the interference list of any transmission in F(3) is equal to
E, i.e., I(3)i, j = {(α, β) | (α, β) ∈ E} for (i, j) ∈ T(3). By Lemmas 4
and 5, we have
Γ(Fˆ) = Γ(Fˆ(3)) = Γ(F˜(3)). (6)
Therefore, we can analyze the approximation factor of Al-
gorithm DPS by deriving the ratio between Γ(F˜) and Γ(F˜(3))
instead.
Theorem 5. Algorithm DPS is an optimal algorithm for the
OPT-LS problem when ϕ = 1.
Proof: For the single-hop case (i.e., a star network topol-
ogy), all of the transmissions have the same receiving station,
i.e., the BS. Any transmission could interfere with the others
and, consequently, the concurrent transmissions for different
service flows are not allowed. Then this theorem follows
directly from Lemma 5.
Now we consider the OPT-LS problem with arbitrary number
of hops. The intuition behind the following proofs is that the
receiver of any uplink transmission can be either the BS or an
7
Similarly, if (T X(1)i′ , j′,2,RX
(1)
i′, j′,2) ∈ I
(1)
i, j,1, then we have
Ii,2 j−1 ⊇ {(α, β) ∈ E | β = T Xi,2 j−1 or β = RXi,2 j−1
or α = T Xi,2 j−1 or α = RXi,2 j−1}
⊇ {(α, β) ∈ E | β = RXi′ ,2 j′−1}
= {(α, β) ∈ E | β = RX(1)i′ , j′}
= I(1)i′, j′
= I(1)i′, j′,1
3 (T X(1)i′, j′,1,RX
(1)
i′, j′,1)
= (T X(1)i′, j′,2,RX
(1)
i′, j′,2)
= (T Xi′,2 j′ ,RXi,2 j′ )
and reach a contradiction.
Case 3: γ = γ′ = 2. This case can be proved in a way similar
to that of Case 1 and is omitted here.
Lemma 7. Given optimal schedules F˜(1) and F˜(3) for F(1) and
F
(3)
, we have Γ(F˜(1)) ≤ (1 + r)Γ(F˜(3)) when ϕ ≤ 2.
Proof: When ϕ ≤ 2, ϕ(1) = κ(1)i = 1 for i ∈ F(1), in the sense
that every flow in F(1) has only one transmission. We divide F(1)
into 1+r disjoint flow subsets F(1,1), F(1,2), . . . , F(1,1+r) such that
RX(1,u)i, j is station u for any 1 ≤ u ≤ 1 + r, (i, j) ∈ T(1,u). Then,
Γ(F˜(1)) ≤
∑
1≤u≤1+r
Γ(F˜(1,u)). (8)
The above inequality holds because of the reason as fol-
lows: Assume that we divide F˜(1) into 1 + r disjoint subsets
F˜
[1,1], . . . , F˜[1,1+r] such that RX[1,u]i,1 is station u for i ∈ F˜
[1,u].
Because F˜[1,u] is also a feasible schedule for F(1,u), its profit
is no larger than that of an optimal schedule for F(1,u), i.e.,
Γ(F˜[1,u]) ≤ Γ(F˜(1,u)), for 1 ≤ u ≤ 1 + r.
On the other hand, since every transmission in T(1,u) has
the same receiver, concurrent transmissions are not allowed
for any feasible schedule, and an optimal schedule F˜(1,u) is of
no exception. Moreover, every transmission in T(1,u) is merged
from some transmissions of a flow in F (refer to Figure 5)
and, consequently, corresponds to some transmissions in F(3)
(because F(3) is the same as F, except that I(3)i, j = E for (i, j) ∈
T
(3)). Therefore, scheduling the corresponding transmissions in
F
(3) at the time instances according to those in F˜(1,u) yields a
feasible schedule for F(3) (even though a transmission in F(3)
and its corresponding transmission in F˜(1,u) may have different
transmitters and receivers). It is sufficient to show that
Γ(F˜(1,u)) ≤ Γ(F˜(3)),
for 1 ≤ u ≤ 1 + r. Substituting into Equation (8) yields
Γ(F˜(1)) ≤
∑
1≤u≤1+r
Γ(F˜(3)) = (1 + r) × Γ(F˜(3)).
Theorem 6. Algorithm DPS is a (1+r)-approximation algorithm
for the OPT-LS problem when ϕ ≤ 2.
Proof: This theorem follows directly from Lemmas 6
and 7.
3.3.2 General Case: Relaxing Two-hop Constraint
In this section, we tackle the general case, where F is not subject
to the two-hop constraint. When ϕ > 2, Lemma 7 may not hold
because there exists some i ∈ F(1) with κ(1)i > 1, in the sense that
a flow may have two transmissions having different receivers.
Therefore, we could not divide the flows of F(1) into 1 + r
disjoint subsets such that a feasible schedule for F(3) can be
derived based on the schedules for the 1+ r subsets, as we did
in the proof to Lemma 7. In the following lemmas, we intend
to show that there exists an input instance F(2) such that
Γ(F˜(1))
(1 + r)ζ
≤
Γ(F˜(2))
(1 + r)
≤ Γ(F˜(3)) (9)
for some ζ.
We construct F(2) by rearranging the receiver of every trans-
mission in F(1) such that all the transmissions of each flow in
F
(2) have the same receiver. The key point is how we rearrange
the receivers so that Equation (9) can hold. We create a vertex-
weighted graph G(1) = (M, J) based on F˜(1) to help us do
the rearrangement as follows: Each vertex i ∈ M represents
a flow i ∈ F˜(1) and is associated with a weight zi = w(1)i . Thus,
|M| = |F˜(1) | and the total weight of the vertices is
W = Γ(F˜(1)) =
∑
i∈ F
w
(1)
i =
∑
i∈M
zi. (10)
Each edge (i, i′) ∈ J represents that the two flows
i, i′ ∈ F˜(1) have some overlapped transmissions, i.e., J ={
(i, i′) | ∀ i, i′ ∈ M,∃ j, j′ s.t. T˜ (1)i, j ⇔ T˜ (1)i′, j′
}
. Suppose that there
exists a subset Mˇ ⊆ M such that the induced subgraph
Gˇ(1) = (Mˇ, Jˇ) is (1 + r)-colorable and
∑
i∈M zi ≤ ζ ×
∑
i∈ M zi
(we will prove its existence later). Then we have (1 + r)
disjoint independent vertex subsets Mˇ1, . . . , Mˇ1+r such that⋃
1≤u≤1+r Mˇu = Mˇ. Note that there is no edge between any
pair of vertices in the same independent subset. It implies that
the corresponding flows have no overlapped transmission and
the transmissions of the flows can be rearranged to the same
receiver. We now rearrange the receivers of the transmissions
in F(1) to construct F(2) based on the 1+ r independent subsets:
For each flow i ∈ F(1), if the corresponding vertex is in some
independent subset Mˇβ, then we select an arbitrary node α such
that (α, β) ∈ E and use the link for all of its transmissions
(i.e., the transmitter and receiver are set as stations α and β
respectively). Otherwise, we select an arbitrary link in E for all
of its transmissions. The interference list of each transmission is
also rearranged accordingly, i.e., I(2)i, j = {(α, β) ∈ E | β = RX
(2)
i, j }.
Lemma 8. Given optimal schedules F˜(2) and F˜(3) for F(2) and
F
(3)
, we have Γ(F˜(2)) ≤ (1 + r)Γ(F˜(3)).
Proof: The transmissions of every flow in F(2) have the
same receiver. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 7 and
omitted here.
Lemma 9. Given optimal schedules F˜(1) and F˜(2) for F(1) and
F
(2)
, we have Γ(F˜(1)) ≤ ζΓ(F˜(2)) for some ζ.
Proof: We prove this lemma by showing that there exists
a feasible schedule Fˆ(2) for F(2) such that Γ(F˜(1)) ≤ ζΓ(Fˆ(2)) for
some ζ. If it exists, then the lemma holds since Γ(Fˆ(2)) ≤ Γ(F˜(2)).

In the derivation from Equation (13a) to Equation (13b),
we intend to merge the first two terms (and leave the last
term unchanged) based on the argument as follows: Since
[s1(T˜(1,β,1)), f1(T˜(1,β,1))] and [s1(T˜(1,β,2)), f| T(1,β,2) |(T˜(1,β,2))] are two
disjoint subintervals of [s1(T˜(1,β)), f| T(1,β)|(T˜(1,β))], any transmis-
sion overlapped with either of the two subintervals must be
overlapped with [s1(T˜(1,β)), f| T(1,β)|(T˜(1,β))] as well. Moreover,
for any station u, only the transmission overlapped with
[s1(T˜(1,β,2)), s1(T˜(1,β,2))] (if exists) could be overlapped with both
of the two subintervals. In the derivation from Equation (13b) to
Equation (13c), we simply merge the second term into the third
term and then replace the indexes, where |T˜(1,β,2)| = |T˜(1,β)| − 1
and sk(T˜(1,β,2)) = sk+1(T˜(1,β)). Thus, Equation (12) holds for any
β (1 ≤ β ≤ 1 + r).
Then we prove this lemma with Equation (12) as follows:

If the weights zi and zi′ of two vertices are counted in
Equation (14a), then there must exist two corresponding flows
whose weights w(1)i and w
(1)
i′ are counted (at least once) in
Equation (14b), because each edge (i, i′) ∈ J corresponds to two
flows i, i′ ∈ F˜(1) having overlapped transmissions. Substituting
Equation (12) into Equation (14b) yields Equation (14c). In
the derivation from Equation (14c) to Equation (14d), we
use the property that
∑
1≤k≤| T(1,β)| x
(
T˜
(1,u), sk(T˜(1,β)), sk(T˜(1,β))
)

(
T˜
(1,u), s1(T˜(1,β)), f| T(1,β)|(T˜(1,β))
)
≤ x(T˜(1,u), 0,∞), for any u (1 ≤
u ≤ 1 + r). In Equation (14d),
∑
1≤u≤1+r x(T˜(1,u), 0,∞) is the
total weight of all the transmissions in T˜(1). It is exactly
equal to
∑
i∈ F(1) (κ
(1)
i w
(1)
i ) in Equation (14e). Finally, we obtain
δ¯ ≤ (1+r)(1+ϕ) with some simple substitution and cancelation.
Lemma 11. There exists Mˇ ⊆ M such that the induced sub-
graph Gˇ(1) = (Mˇ, Jˇ) is (1+r)-colorable and∑i∈M zi ≤ ζ×∑i∈ M zi
for some ζ.
Proof: It have been proved in [34] that, for any vertex-
weighted graph G(1) = (M, J), there exists an indepen-
dent set with total weight no less than W1+flδ . Then the
lemma can be proven by iteratively performing MAX WEIGHTED
INDEPENDENT SET (1+r) times as follows: In the first iteration,
the input is the graph G(1) = (M, J) with the weighted average
degree δ¯ while the output is a maximum independent set
MD ⊆ M. By removing the derived independent set from G(1),
we have the remaining vertex set MR = M \ MD and the
remaining edge set JR = J \ {(α, β) | α ∈ MD or β ∈ MD}. The
remaining graph G(1)R = (MR, JR) with the weighted average
degree δ¯R is then taken as the input of the next iteration. Note
that δ¯R ≤ δ¯ − 1 because any vertex in M will be deprived of at
least one edge after an iteration. If any vertex i ∈ MR has the
same weighted degree as that in M, the vertex will be chosen
as a vertex in MD. Let Ψχ be the weight of the family of χ
disjoint independent sets after the χth iteration. We have
Ψχ ≥ Ψχ−1 +
W −Ψχ−1
δ¯ − χ
, for χ ≥ 1.
Then we prove Ψχ ≥ (χW)/(1 + δ¯) by the induction on χ. Let
Ψ0 = 0. By the inductive hypothesis for Ψχ−1,
Ψχ ≥ Ψχ−1 +
W −Ψχ−1
δ¯ − χ
≥
(χ − 1)W
1 + δ¯
+
W − (χ−1)W1+flδ
δ¯ − χ
≥ χW/(1 + δ¯).
Thus, letting
∑
i∈ M zi = Ψ1+r, we have∑
i∈ M
zi = Ψ1+r
≥
(1 + r)W
1 + δ¯
≥
∑
i∈M
zi ×
1 + r
1 + (1 + r)(1 + ϕ)
. (by Lemma 10)
The lemma is proven with ζ = 1+(1+r)(1+ϕ)1+r .
Theorem 7. DPS is a (1+(1+r)(1+ϕ))-approximation algorithm
for OPT-LS, where r is the number of relay stations and ϕ is
the maximum hop count of service ows.
Proof:
Γ(Fˆ) = Γ(Fˆ(3)) (by Lemma 4)
= Γ(F˜(3)) (by Lemma 5)

1 + r
Γ(F˜(2)) (by Lemma 8)

Theorem 7 actually suggests that deploying networks with
short hop counts to BS is good to optimize system performance.
This fact is already empirically known, but Theorem 7 provides

(c) Effect of dmean
Fig. 6. Performance comparison of DPS, DPS-SR, and OPT in
a one-hop relay scenario.
increase of the secondary-interference probability results in the
decrease of the performance gap between DPS-SR and OPT.
If secondary interference is very serious (i.e., the concurrent
transmissions can not be found), DPS-SR and OPT have the
same performance as DPS, as indicated by Lemma 5.
Figure 7(a) shows a network topology, and the schedule
profits produced by DPS, DPS-SR, and OPT under different bmean
and dmean are demonstrated in Figure 7(b) and Figure 7(c).
Compared with the case of one-hop relay, the schedule profits in
the two-hop relay scenario are degraded for all algorithms under
investigation. However, the performance of our DPS-SR is quite
close to that of OPT since link resources are effectively utilized
by adopting spatial reuse. Although there is a larger difference
of the schedule profits between DPS and OPT, DPS can be
adopted for the WRNs where the BSs have low computational
capability and a link scheduler with lower time complexity is
preferred.
4.2 Comparison of DPS-SR and EDF
In this section, the performance of our DPS-SR is compared
with that of EDF. To make the comparison convincing, the
EDF algorithm is modified to reject the requesting flows whose
deadlines can not be met in a frame. Also, EDF allows spatial
reuse to achieve higher performance. We assume that each SS
has no admitted flows since the EDF can not guarantee that
the previously admitted service flows will be scheduled in the
frame.
(a) Network topology
(b) Effect of bmean
(c) Effect of dmean
Fig. 7. Performance comparison of DPS, DPS-SR, and OPT in
a two-hop relay scenario.
The performance metric of this experiment is system through-
put. Accordingly, the weight of DPS-SR, wi, is set by the
normalized required bandwidth N(bi) of a service flow, where
the integer N(x) is linearly transformed from x and has the
range [0, 20].
We consider three deployment scenarios. As the previous
experiment, the first scenario adopts the two-hop relay shown
in Figure 7(a). Each SS is assumed to have eight request-
ing flows. Figure 8(a) shows the effect of bmean on system
throughput. In the figure, a reference line denotes the total
amount of requesting demands. From this figure, we observe
that DPS-SR significantly outperforms EDF and the improvement
is around 20%. When the system resources are sufficient (i.e.,
small bmean), the system throughput of DPS-SR is close to the
upper bound. Figure 8(b) shows the system throughput against
dmean for DPS-SR and EDF. As dmean increases, the increase of
the system throughput tends to be small. This indicates that the
system throughput is quite irrelevant to the deadlines of service
flows for large dmean, and is mainly affected by the efficiency
of scheduling algorithms instead.
Figure 9(a) shows the second scenario where all RSs are
located around the BS for throughput enhancement. In this
scenario, we assume that each RS supervises one SS, and
each SS has 24 requesting flows. The numbers of RSs are
respectively set as 4, 6 and 8, and we will show some numerical
examples in Figures 9(b) and 9(c) by averaging the results
of the three cases. Figure 9(b) shows the effect of bmean on
system throughput. Similar to what we observe in Figure 8(a),
