計畫英文摘要 
 
 
During normal operations of UAV or RPV，to insure the control and stability of vehicles are in  
the safety boundary, most of them are still controlled by a remote operator.  Instead of utilising 
the surrounding area information of the operator to adjust the aircraft movement, an on board 
controller can used for altitude and attitude holding and this will improve the aerial graphic 
quality and operation reliability.  
 
Hence the main objective for this project is to develop an UAV aerial photographic stabilizer 
system, the system will based on the open architecture UAA controller which we developed for 
control projects. The UAV installed this system is proven that could be stable during whole 
operation.The precision of flight control is +/-15 m in height control, +/- 2 kt in speed control and 
+/- 3deg/s in turn rate control.
