英文摘要 (Abstract)  
In this project, we synthesized the novel 
nanoelectrocatalyst with the excellent 
electrochemical activities by loading 
size-selected Pt nanoparticles on sulfonated 
graphene. In the 1st part of this project, the 
effects of the solution systems during the 
adsorption process on the dispersion of 
size-selected Pt nanoparticles and their 
electrochemical properties have been 
investigated. It is found that the 
high-concentration solution system will result 
in the high-performance nanoelectrocatalyst 
for methanol oxidation reaction. In the 2nd 
part of this project, it is demonstrated that the 
optimal (NH4)2SO4 treated graphene will be 
good for the dispersion of size-selected Pt 
nanoparticles. The best mass activity in our 
catalysts is over 600 mA/mgPt. On the other 
hand, the density functional theory calculation 
provides the theoretical density for sulfonic 
functional groups which occupy the graphene 
surfaces. It is suggested that the appropriate 
concentration of surface sulfonic functional 
groups plays a key role in regards to the 
dispersion of size-selected Pt colloidal 
nanoparticles and the electrochemical 
activities of nanoelectrocatalyst.  
 
Keywords: size-selected Pt nanoparticles,

1. Introduction 
  The discovery of fuel cells dates back to the 
late 1830’s. The direct methanol fuel cell 
(DMFC) is a particular case of a low 
temperature fuel cell (FC) typically operated  
in the range of 40 to 75 oC. [1] A DMFC 
utilizes CH3OH as anode fuel and O2 as 
cathode fuel. DMFCs can have much higher 
energy density than that of a Li-ion battery 
and can be refueled on the fly within seconds. 
However, significant challenges are related to 
the anode catalyst such as lowering the cost of 
the amount of catalyst used as well as to the 
need to extend the lifetime of the anode 
catalyst. Since Pt is the model FC catalyst, the 
oxidation of methanol on Pt (h k l) surfaces 
has been discussed.Seeking the best electrode 
materials consisting of carbon-supported 
electrocatalysts plays a key role in the route 
towards enhanced and optimized FC 
performance. In the real electrode of a FC,

synthesized by mixing PtCl4 (0.4652g) and 
ethylene glycol (50ml) and reflux the solution 
at 160 oC for 3 hrs.The size of these Pt 
colloidal nanoparticles can be controlled in a 
narrow size distribution ranged around 1.7 nm 
with the specific concentration of 0.1M NaOH 
in ethylene glycol. [8b]  
Pt/Graphene (Pt/G) Catalyst Prepared in 
different solution systems: 
Add graphene and Pt colloid solution in the 
mixture of sulfuric acid and ethylene glycol. 
The weight ratio of graphene supported Pt 
catalyst is prepared with a Pt loading of 20 
wt%. Regarding to various solution system, 
the volumes of mixture solutions are 20, 40, 
100, 200, and 400 ml. Then the ratios of 
graphene weight (in terms of mg) and solution 
volume (in terms of ml) were denoted as 1 (20 
mg/20 ml), 0.5 (20 mg/40 ml), 0.2 (20 mg/100 
ml), 0.1 (20 mg/200 ml) and 0.05 (20 mg/400 
ml) and used to categorize different catalysts. 
Hence the resulting catalysts are named as 
Pt-G-1.0, Pt-G-0.5, Pt-G-0.2, Pt-G-0.1, and 
Pt-G-0.05. Afterwards, the suspension were 
stirred for 24 hrs and treated using 
ultrasonication for 8 hrs. The suspension were 
filtered through polymer membrane (0.1-μm 
vvpp) and dried in oven for 2 days.  
Preparation of Pt-C, Pt-G and Pt-sG 
catalysts:  
XC-72R and graphene powders were mixed 
with the Pt colloidal solution in 2 M sulfuric 
acid and ethyl glycol in a volume ratio of 1:1, 
respectively, stirred for 24 hrs, and then 
ultrasonically treated for 8 hrs. The resultant 
material was filtered and dried for 48 hrs to 
obtain the Pt/C and Pt/G catalyst. For the 
sulfonation treatment of graphene, we used 
the approach for Xu that use sulfate salts to 
modify carbon. [15] Because carbon particles 
are normally produced from hydrocarbon 
materials, there are always some hydrogen 
atoms on the surface. Based on the following 
schemes, it is believed that at 235 °C 
(NH4)2SO4 decomposes according to Reaction 
1, and the formed SO3 reacts with carbon via 
its surface hydrogen atoms to have -SO3H 
groups linked onto it according to Reaction 2:  
(NH4)2SO4  2NH3 + H2O + SO3  [1] 
Carbon-H + SO3  Carbon-SO3H  [2] 
In order to control the concentration of 
sulfonic functional group on graphene surface, 
we adjusted the weight of (NH4)2SO4 in DI 
water to be 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.001 and 0.0005 g. 
By adding the graphene with the same mass as 
water, the resultant samples are sG0.5, sG0.1, 
sG0.05, sG0.001, sG0.0005 after heating at 235 oC. 
The sulfonated graphene powders were mixed 
with Pt colloidal nanoparticles to become 
Pt-sG0.5, Pt-sG0.1, Pt-sG0.05, Pt-sG0.001, 
Pt-sG0.0005 catalysts.  
Preparation of Ink:  
The 6-mg Pt/C and Pt/G catalyst was mixed 
with DI water, ethanol, and Nafion (5 wt%) 
and then ultrasonically treated in order to form 
the Pt-C, Pt-G and Pt-sG inks.  
Electrode Preparation and Modification: 
Approximately 10 μL of each ink were 
dropped onto a clean GC electrode and dried 
at room temperature.  
Instrumentations and Techniques: 
Transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 
JEM-1230, 100 kV) was used to characterize 
sample morphologies. Electrochemical 
experiments were performed with a 
potentiostat (Metek, VersaStat 3). Fourier 
Transfer Infrared Spectrometer (Bruker, 
Tensor 27) was used to detect the functional 
group on graphene surface to ensure the 
formation of sulfonic group after sulfonation 
treatment. High-angle-annular-dark-field 
scanning transmission electron microscope

science between graphene and its functional 
group, some cluster models were adopted for 
detailed investigation. Based on the density 
functional calculation of the electron density, 
the steric resistance of SO3 group has been 
demonstrated so that the minimum distance 
between two nearby SO3 group is decided. 
Figure 3(a) shows the electron density 
contoured on one SO3 molecule which is used 
to estimate the occupied area of the SO3 
functional group. Figure 3(b) shows the 
electrostatic potential mapping on total 
density which can be performed the electrical 
charge distributions in density region. The 
calculated radius of occupied space for SO3 
group is about 2.86 angstrom by using 
B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. The theoretical 
occupied area of one sulfonic group (AS) on 
graphene surface is evaluated by calculated 
geometrical structure and electronic density. 
To visualize the distributions of sulfonic 
groups on graphene surface, we assume the 
diameter of a unit Pt nanoparticle size is 2 nm. 
Therefore a 4-nm2-large area of graphene 
surface (AG) could be occupied by a specific 
number of sulfonic functional groups under a 
Pt nanoparticle. The maximum number of one 
monolayer sulfonic functional groups (Ntheo) 
on graphene surface can be determined by:  
Ntheo = AG / AS        [1] 
and 
AS = (BS-O + RO- pauling)  cosθ     [2] 
where BS-O is the calculated bond length 
between sulfur and oxygen atoms in an 
sulfonic group; RO-pauling is ionic radius of 
oxygen atom; θ is the angle of S-O bond to the 
graphene surface. On the other hand, there are 
two stacking models for many SO3 functional 
groups to form the monolayer adsorption on 
graphene in Figures 3(c) and 3(d). The above 
two models can give rise to the low and high 
densities of SO3 functional groups on 
graphene, respectively. In combination of the 
information in Figure 3(a) to 3(d), it indicates 
that each SO3 group will become small while 
the total density of all SO3 groups are high. 
Figure 3 (e) shows the C 1s XPS spectra of 
graphene, sG0.001, and sG0.5. With more 
(NH4)2SO4 in the sulfonation treatment, the 
main peak intensity of C 1s of support 
materials gradually decreases along with 
increasing shoulder intensity. It indicates that 
the amount of functional group with negative 
charge is proportional to (NH4)2SO4 weight in 
process. Figure 3 (f) shows the S 2p XPS 
spectra of three support materials. For sG0.001 
and sG0.5 in Figure 3 (f), the signals of S 2p 
and S 2s were attributed to sulfonic functional 
groups on graphene which are similar to those 
on the GO framework. [16] According to the 
Raman spectra of graphene, sG0.001, and sG0.5 
support materials, it suggests that more 
disorder structures are formed on graphene 
after the sulfonation treatment. The symmetry 
of sp2 bonding structure of graphene can be 
distorted by adding the sulfonic functional 
groups onto the surface and it is found that the 
intensities of 2D band become lower than that 
of graphene. [17] FTIR was used to 
characterize the functional group on graphene 
surfaces before and after sulfonation treatment. 
In figure S1, the FTIR spectra are very 
different through sulfonation treatment. The 
peaks in 1163 cm−1 and 1210 cm−1 could arise 
from symmetric and asymmetric SO3 
stretching vibrations of sulfonate and the SO2 
unit of sulfonic acid groups. [18] The peaks at 
1190 and 1044 cm−1 could be assigned to the 
SO3 group asymmetric and symmetric 
vibrational adsorption [19] The obvious peak 
after treatment at 1100 cm−1 could be 
attributed to the formation of SO3 functional 
 8
change along with the various sulfonation 
treatments. The size of Pt can be correlated to 
the Pt{1 1 1} and Pt {1 0 0} so the size effect 
by the variations in the atom numbers on Pt {1 
1 1} and Pt {1 0 0} faces, and of the edge and 
corner sites would vary with particle size. 
Sa´nchez-Sa´nchez compare different Pt 
nanoparticles with different. [21] It is reported 
that in 0.5MH2SO4 PtNPhexa composed with 
Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(1 1 1) has the high activity in 
oxygen reduction reaction. In our study, 
Figure 7(b) indicates that the Pt nanoparticles 
are adsorbed on graphene with different ways. 
The good dispersion of Pt colloids results in 
strong Pt(1 0 0) and Pt(1 1 1) peaks. The Pt(1 
0 0) and Pt(1 1 1) peak in sG0.001 are higher 
than others. Therefore, it suggests that there is 
no obvious aggregation of Pt colloids on 
sG0.001.  
The performance of methanol oxidation 
reaction (MOR)electrocatalyst was studied by 
a glassy carbon Figure 8 shows the 
current-potential curves  of MOR for all 
catalysts in 0.5 M H2SO4 + 1.0 M CH3OH at 
room tempature. Figure 8(a-b) are the 
geometric and mass activities of various 
catalysts. Hence,the ratio of the forward peak 
current density (If) to the reverse anodic peak 
current density (Ib), If/Ib, can be used to 
describe the catalyst tolerance to 
carbonaceous species accumulation.From the 
geometric and mass activities,it is found that 
the forward scan peak current increases while 
the mount of (NH4)2SO4 in sulfonation 
process is lowered. Meanwhile, the reverse 
scan peak currents also increase so as to lower 
the If/Ib ratios. This results indicate that the 
CO tolerance needs to be further improved 
though the methanol oxidation reaction is 
good in our catalysts which is not similar to 
the result in published paper. [5] Although the 
low amount of (NH4)2SO4 can improve the 
oxidation current, comparing the results of 
Pt-sG0.001 and Pt-sG0.0005 the lowest 
(NH4)2SO4 usage does not guarantee the 
higher performance. These results suggest that 
there is an optimal concentration of surface 
functional groups on graphene surfaces that is 
necessary for the best catalytic property. The 
highest currents from sG0.001 among all 
catalysts are 7.75 mA /cm2 and 642.03 mA 
/mgPt. In comparison with the results recently 
reported by Shang et al., the methanol 
oxidation currents of the size-selected Pt on 
sulfonated graphene are higher than those of 
sputtered Pt on graphene nanoflake films. [22] 
In Figure 8 (c), the specific activity was 
obtained after the currents were divided by the 
ECSA of each catalyst and act for the current 
generated by each unit of active area of 
catalysts. It is found that the numbers of 
specific activities five Pt-sG catalysts are 
lower than those of Pt-C and Pt-G. With 
regards to mass and geometric activities, the 
oxidation peak current will increase by 
lowering the usage of (NH4)2SO4 but reach the 
highest point for Pt-sG0.001. Similar effect is 
also observed for ECSA and ESA from 
Pt-sG0.001. On the contrary, If/Ib ratios 
decrease after sulfonation treatment.  
 
4. Conclusion 
In summary Pt-G-1 catalyst has the best 
electrochemical activities in all catalysts made 
in different solution systems. In the solution 
system with higher concentration more 
size-selected Pt nanoparticles will be adsorbed 
on graphene that bring the higher ECSA and 
MOR current. On the other hand, the 
sulfonation treatment of graphene can increase 
the adsorption sites for size-elected Pt 
nanoparticles due to the functional group on

單位：化工與材料工程學系, 長庚大學 
很高興這次能夠有機會參加在法國南部蔚藍海岸旁的尼斯 (Nice)舉辦的 the 
61st Annual Meeting of the International Society of Electrochemistry 
(http://event10.ise-online.org/)，因為在西歐先進國家的消費水準比起國內都非常
高，因此我採用跟去年一樣找室友分攤住房費用的策略，這次很幸運的我又能夠
找到台灣科技大學化學工程系的黃炳照講座教授暨系主任 (現任國科會化工學
門召集人和最近第八屆有庠科技講座 )作我的室友一起住在離會場不遠並有
免費無線上網和早餐的 All Seasons Vieux Port 
(http://www.all-seasons-nice-vieux-port.cote.azur.fr/page_en_1.html)，節省了部分經
費，另外在從台北出發經由巴黎前往法國尼斯的路程中則有拿到本校經費補助的
碩士班周義翔同學 (本系林修正副教授實驗室)一起行動，頗感有趣。 
因為這次在會前有做一點功課看到 program裡有一位和我今年年初向國科
會合提台灣-以色列 (NSC (National Science Council)/MOST (Ministry of Science 
and Technology))國際合作計畫的 Prof. Lital Alfonta (Ben-Gurion University of the 
Negev, Israel)也要出席，所以行李中多了一份小禮物並且順利交到她的手中，雖
然計畫仍在審查當中，但是見過面後的情誼讓我對雙方未來在 Nanotechnology 
and Medical Devices方向上的合作可能性更添信心，另外加拿大的前同事 Prof. 
Elena Baranova (Ottawa University, Canada)這次也參加了本次會議並且在我演講
的時候以發問的方式進行了短暫的交流，還跟來自 Prof. Andy Xueliang Sun 
(University of Western Ontario, Canada)實驗室的博士後 Dr. Shuhui Sun有幾次的
交談，Prof. A. Sun和 Dr. S. Sun目前有一篇 Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.的論文被接受
後在編輯中，之後我會與對方實驗室在使用本實驗室製作的石墨烯奈米帶 
(graphene nanoribbon)在鋰離子電池和燃料電池上有所合作；雖然仍對歐洲的 PI
不太熟悉，但是亞洲的 PI們都踴躍出席，熟面孔包括 Prof. Hasuck Kim (Seoul 
National University, Korea)、Prof. Masahiro Watanabe (University of Yamanashi, 
Japan)、Prof. T. Osaka (Waseda University, Japan)、Prof. Shi-Gang Sun (Xiamen 
University, China)、Prof. ZhongFan Liu (Peking University, China)，台灣這次參加
的人員包括台科大黃炳照教授、台灣大學林麗瓊教授、中研院陳貴賢教授和中央
大學張仍奎教授，加上學生們這一屆在法國尼斯舉行的會議的台灣參加人數約有
二十餘人。 
Sep. 26 (Sun)有二場 Tutorial Lectures，我和黃炳照教授一同參加的主題是
Redox Protein and Redox Enzyme Electrochemistry： Fundamental Studies and 
Applications，分別是由 Dr. Christophe Leger (France)主講 Direct electron transfer
和 Prof. Phil Bartlett (UK)主講Mediated electron transfer，這兩位都是我在台灣原
先並不熟悉的學者，但是看起來頗年輕的 Dr. C. Leger卻給我非常深刻的印象，

nanostructures: from pristine materials to molecular devices，是少數在奈米碳材研究
領域尚未被我認識的學者但是他們做了不錯的工作 ((a) JACS 2005, 127, 8. (b)

Acc. Chem. Res. 2009, 42, 1890. (f) Nature Chemistry DOI: 10.1038/NCHEM761)；
在 Argonne的Materials Science Division的 Dr. N. Markovic在 Surface 
electrochemistry at two and three phase interfaces中提到這兩年他們發表的三篇
Nature子期刊的論文 ((a) nc 2009, 1, 466. (b) nc 2010, 2, 880. (c) nm, in press.)。 
Sep. 30 (Thu)上午 Prof. Allen Brad (The University of Texas, Austin, USA)為大
會給了一場 plenary talk主題是 Electrochemistry of single molecules and particles，
演講中多次提到 nanoparticle和電極表面 collision現象造成的電化學訊號與
nanoparticle在液體中的濃度有關，類似的觀念可以做為目前本實驗室準備投稿
論文的借鏡；Prof. B. Hayden (UK)談到 particle size and support effects in 
electrocatalysis ((a) J. Combinational Chem. 2006, 8, 679. (b) Angew. 2007, 46, 3530. 
(c) JPCC 2007, 111, 17044. (d) PCCP 2009, 11, 1564.)；Dr. V. Flexer (France)談到
Three-dimensional carbonaceous porous electrodes for biofuel cells ((a) JACS 2002, 
124, 12962. (b) Energy & Environmental Science 2010, 3, 1302.)；Dr. F. Giroud 
(France)真正地將biofuel cell impalnt到白老鼠身上做 in vivo的實驗並測試其發電
功率對時間的關係；Oct. 1 (Fri)早上中研院陳貴賢教授演講 Photoelectrochemical 
production of hydrogen using III-nitride semiconductors，雖然是大會的最後一天，
陳老師的演講還是吸引不少人注意，其演講資料的豐富程度非常值得我學習 ((a) 
Acc. Chem. Res. 1995, 28, 141-145. (b) JMC DOI: 101039.)。 
星期四晚宴的時候與中國科學院長春應用化學研究所(http://www.ciac.jl.cn/)
的汪爾康院士 (Erkang Wang)和董紹俊院士同桌用餐，汪院士在 1991年成為中國
科學院院士後又在 1993年當選發展中國家科學院院士，兩位院士在分析化學上
都有極高的造詣，特別是汪先生說到今年剛在大連物化所召開的第六屆海峽兩岸
分析化學會議，讓我注意起在未來也可以在台灣共襄盛舉，另外同桌吃飯的還有
汪先生的學生 Prof. Qijin Chi (Technical University of Denmark, Denmark)，還有武
漢大學的 Prof. Lin Zhuang，他在 2007年有兩篇 J. Am. Chem. Soc.和一篇 Angew. 
Chem. Int. Ed.，對燃料電池相較於鋰離子電池的前景極有信心，另外在 Division 
Meeting時也很踴躍地發表意見，是去年 ISE2009在北京之外的武漢三峽的
satellite meeting的負責人。
