INTRODUCTION 
 
Recently, strong industrial demand for higher integration and packaging densities of 
electronic devices has resulted in the miniaturization of manufacturing process. When scaling 
down a conventional forming process to micro scale, the effect of the so-called size effect 
needs to be considered. The microstructural features (grain size and boundary) and the 
interfacial conditions (friction and roughness) show a significant effect on the process 
characteristics. Although experiments lead to some new discoveries, theoretical or numerical 
solutions are necessary tools for process optimization. It is, therefore, important to have valid 
modeling tools for the forming of products in such scale. One major problem in adapting 
forming modeling tools to this field of application is that the geometric surface features on the 
dies become very significant, and their effect on the material flow needs to be taken into 
consideration accurately. Its control and predictability are important for the functionality, 
costs and quality of produced parts. 
The focus of this paper is the establishment of geometric description and equivalence 
between flat interfaces to evaluate the contact friction with a conventional friction mode. The 
idea of modeling friction from the interface geometry, between work-piece and tool, has 
attracted the attention of many researchers but they have been unable to find any proposal for 
the creation of an empirical relation between friction and the surface roughness profile. 
Previous workers such as Edwards and Halling [1], Wanheim and Abildgaard [2] and Avitzur 
et al. [3] have used physical modeling, slip line field, and upper bound techniques and much 
attention has been paid to the deformation of asperities of the work-piece. Osakada and 
Matsumoto [4] made an approach to modeling the surface friction but did not seek to develop 
an empirical relationship that could be used generally in simulation of forming processes. 
The size effect on surface layer that the grain size and plastic strain will induce a coarse 
roughness on free surface during deformation, i.e. surface roughness increasing. A friction 
model with size effect for sliding friction coefficient will be suggested to provide fundamental 
information about the interfacial conditions of contact surface in micro scale. 
In this research, a simple contact model that is composed of interference and adhesion 
effects of asperities (roughness) in micro view is proposed and developed to model the sliding 
friction via the Amonton-Coulomb friction law. It is based on the assumption that friction is 
due to the adhesion in the normal contact and the interference in the lateral contact with 
surface roughness. This assumption covers the real physical surface behavior, which consists 
of adhesion and interference. A roughness model is established to explore the interference 
effect on contact friction. The coefficient of sliding friction is predicted by the proposed 
model and compared with the measured values with the ring compression test under dry 
condition. To understand the contact friction accurately, the effects of material property and 
surface roughness are examined. The model leads to a relationship between surface roughness 
and contact friction. 
 
BASIC ANALYSIS 
 
Based on the physical contact behavior of interaction of roughness (as asperity) between 
tool and work-piece, the proposed model includes two parts, one is the adhesion effect due to 
the normal contact as shown in Fig.1; the other is the interference effect due to the lateral 
contact as shown in Fig.2. The surface roughness of tool (rigid-like body) denotes  and 
keeps as a constant during deformation. The free surface roughness of work-piece 
(deformable) denotes , which is of variety during deformation and obeys the empirical 
relationship

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
1. Verification of the proposed model 
To investigate the effect of roughness on nominal friction, the published experiment by 
Osakada and Matsumoto [4] are used to prove the proposed model first. In this verification, 
the surface roughness of material  is assumed as the initial roughness MaR
M
aR . 
Figure 3 shows the comparison between prediction and experiment for material A1050. It 
is clear that the friction coefficient μ  increases as the relative roughness ( )MaTam RRR =  
increases. Although the n-value is unclear in experiment, its common value approaches 0.3 in 
practical use. The prediction of n = 0.3 shows an overestimation. However, the prediction of n 
= 0.36 agrees well with the experiment. Accordingly, its trend is very close to the experiment, 
which is the best fit in trend. 
Figure 4 shows the comparison between prediction and experiment for material C1020. It 
is clear that the friction coefficient μ  increases as the relative roughness ( )MaTam RRR =  
increases. The common n-value of C1020 approaches 0.4 in practical use. The prediction of n 
= 0.4 also shows an overestimation. However, the prediction of n = 0.45 agrees well with the 
experiment. Accordingly, its trend is very close to the experiment, which is the best fit in this 
case. It is easy to verify this proposed model. 
The overestimation of simulation shown in Figs. 3 and 4 may be due to the assumption of 
M
a
M
a RR ≈  because  is very difficult to measure for it is of variety during deformation.  MaR
 
2. Effects of surface condition and material property on dry friction 
Secondly the simulation is carried out to explore the effects of strain hardening exponent 
(material property) and roughness (surface condition) on contact friction. 
Figures 5 to 10 show the effect of dimensionless stress ( )0 umm pS σ=  on friction 
coefficient μ  for various strain hardening exponent n under a certain relative roughness ( )MaTam RRR = . It is clear that the friction coefficient μ  decreases as the dimensionless 
stress ( )0 umm pS σ=  increases at small n-values. Under large n- and small values, the 
friction coefficient 
-mR
μ  decreases firstly, turns to increase secondly, and then appears a 
slightly decreasing in final. However, this trend will decrease as the relative roughness ( )MaTam RRR =  increases that the friction coefficient μ  strictly decreases first and then 
turns to slightly decrease with ( )0 umm pS σ= . 
Figures 11 to 15 show the effect of dimensionless stress ( )0 umm pS σ=  on friction 
coefficient μ  for various relative roughness ( )MaTam RRR =  under a certain strain 
hardening exponent n. It is clear that the friction coefficient μ  strictly decreases first and 
then turns to slightly decrease as the dimensionless stress ( )0 umm pS σ=  increases at small 
n-values. Under large n- and small values, the friction coefficient -mR μ  decreases firstly, 
turns to increase secondly, and then appears a slightly decreasing in final. However, this trend 
will decrease as the relative roughness ( )MaTam RRR =  increases that the friction coefficient 
μ  appears a simple decreasing with ( )0 umm pS σ= .
