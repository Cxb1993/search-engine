considered are the Coulombic force. The 
dominant terms in the continuity and 
momentum equations are retained in the 
present analysis . The governing equation, 
which is a nonlinear differential equation, is 
solved by Adomain’s decomposition method.

1. Introduction  
Any of an unlimited range of particulate, 
liquid, or gaseous contaminants influenced by 
uncontrolled factors of temperature and 
humidity may contain in many industrial 
composition of processing gases. The droplet 
and particle involved in the main fluid stream 
may exploit or suppress the deposition 
depending on the practical requirement. The 
application of pigments, ceramic powders to 
surfaces, chemical coating of metals, and 
filtration all seek more efficient ways of 
increasing deposition, whereas the deposition 
of aerosol particles appears as an unwanted 
phenomenon in the contamination of 
semiconductor elements during manufacture, 
soiling of artistic products and indoor surfaces, 
fouling and corrosion of heat exchangers, boiler 
tubes, turbine equipment, etc. In many cases, 
the charges carried by particles affect their 
deposition. Neutral particles must be charged 
before electrophoresis can occur. The amount 
of electric charges carried by a particle 
depends on the charging methods. Bipolar ions 
bombard the particles and the Boltzmann 
charge equilibrium will result. Unipolar ions, 
on the other hand, charge the particles through 
different mechanisms, diffusion or field 
charging. The number of charges carried by the 
submicrometer /supermicrometer particles 
through the di usion/ eld charging mechanism 
is much greater than that carried by the 
Boltzmann charge equilibrium. The particle 
deposition process with electrostatic forces was 
studied by several researchers. Yu and Chandra 
[1] analyzed the precipitation of charged 
particles by their image forces from laminar 
flows in ducts with different geometries. Using 
an integral method, the deposition of 
contaminant particles from a laminar flow in 
the presence of electrostatic forces was studied 
by Chen [2,3]. Cooper et al. [4] analyzed the 
deposition rates of submicrometer particles due 
to diffusion and electrostatics in a viscous 
axisymmetric stagnation-point flow. Ahmadi [5] 
studied the diffusion of charged Brownian 
particles in the presence of electromagnetic 
fields. A digital simulation technique for 
studying deposition rates of aerosol particles 
with electrostatic forces was reported by Li and 
Ahmadi [6]. Soldati et al. [7] used a direct 
numerical simulation to study the particle 
transport in electrostatic precipitators. 
Goo and Lee,[8]; He and Ahmadi,[9] studies 
on particle deposition in small pipes or parallel 
plates taking various electrostatic external 
forces. Among many Eulerian models 
available for  particle deposition problem, 
there are two important approaches to evaluate 
the particle eddy diffusivity, pε  . One was 
first developed by Corner and Pendlebury [10], 
which was modified later by Crump and 
Seinfeld [11]. Recently, a new semi-empirical 
particle deposition model has been developed 
by Lai & Nazaroff [12]. The loss mechanisms 
considered are Brownian and turbulent 
diffusion and gravitational e ect. The model 
has stronger physical background than 
previous models, which always required ad 
hoc parameters estimation. For large particles, 
the contribution of gravitational force on 
deposition always overwhelms other 
deposition mechanisms. In order to gain more 
physical knowledge on individual deposition 
mechanisms, different orientated surfaces 
should be considered separately. For vertically 
orientated surfaces, electrophoresis may 
enhance the deposition rate of large particles 
more significantly. 
In this paper is, based on the Lai and 
Nazaroff’s model[12], to develop a particle 
deposition model for smooth surfaces 
accounting for Brownian and turbulent 
diffusion, gravity, the Coulombic force. The 
particle charging level is determined by the 
Boltzmann charge distribution, diffusion and 
field charging. The govern equations are solved 
by Adomian’s decomposition method.

from the surface. In general, the image force is 
also quite short range, but it may become 
important under some specific conditions. The 
last two forces, whose magnitudes are 
generally small, are usually neglected. 
Coulombic force is induced when a charged 
particle is placed in an electric field and it can 
be determined by Coulomb’s law. It is 
common to express the amount of charge q as 
n multiples of the smallest unit charge, the 
charge on electron, C101.6 e  -19×= .

force can be either toward or away from the 
surface, depending on the sign of charges and 
the direction of the electric field (electric field 
toward the surface is defined as positive).

4. Decomposition method 
The principal algorithm of the Adomian 
decomposition method when applied to a 
general nonlinear equation is in the form 
                   
( 13 ) 
The linear terms are decomposed into L+R, 
while the nonlinear terms are represented by Nu. 
L is taken as the highest order derivative to 
avoid difficult integration involving 
complicated Green’s functions, and R is the 
remainder of the linear operator. 1−L  is 
regarded as the inverse operator of L and is 
defined by a definite integration from 0 to x, 
i.e. 
 
( 14) 
 
If L is a second-order operator, 1−L  is a 
twofold indefinite integral, i.e. 
  
(15 ) 
 
Operating on both sides of Eq. (13) with 1−L  
yields 
  ( 16 ) 
and gives 
( 17 ) 
The decomposition technique represents the 
solution of Eq. (13) as a series, i.e. 
.
0∑∞== m muu  The nonlinear operator, Nu, is 
decomposed as ∑∞=0m mA .
