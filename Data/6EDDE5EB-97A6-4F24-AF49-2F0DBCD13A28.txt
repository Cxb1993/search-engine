Abstract 
 
Fermentation products of A. terreus ATCC 20542 (the lovastatin-producing fungus) 
were collected by HPLC, and the existence of itaconic acid (IA) was studied.  The 
coexistence of IA with lovastatin in the fermentation was verified by FT-IR, EI-MS 
and NMR verified.  The production of lovastatin achieved 873 mg/l at day 10 in the 
lactose-based medium (LBM), but the production of IA was only at the level of 22-28 
mg/l.  The formation of IA could be significantly enhanced by 20-fold as 491mg/l at 
day 5 when lactose was replaced with glucose.  Morphological studies also revealed 
that the carbon source dominated pellet formation (such as pellet sizes), and altered 
the biosynthetic pathway in the fungus.

a,bFive independent experiments were conducted in each addition of IA standard, 
where the production of lovastatin and biomass at day 10 was presented here.  With 
the removal of the maximum and minimum, the values were means of three 
replications with standard deviation. 
 
 
The results(Table 1) clearly indicated that the carbon source used in the medium 
dominated metabolite production.  Besides, the production of IA and lovastatin were 
both increased during day 1-5, then decreased at day 6 for IA or at day 11 for 
lovastatin (Figure 3a).  Therefore, the trophophase and idiophase might not be 
mutually exclusive since the production of IA and lovastatin occurred simultaneously 
at day 1-5.  This finding also implied that primary and secondary metabolism by the 
fungus might not be viewed as separate events.

Our preliminary results showed that lovastatin, extracted from a 10-day fermentation 
in LBM, appeared at 10.2 min in HPLC chromatogram (Figure 2a), and one of the 
broth peaks at 3-3.5 min were significantly increased when spiked with IA standard 
(10g/l), implying the possible presence of IA in broth (Fig 2b).  Figure 2c showed the 
IA standard in HPLC chromatogram, meanwhile, Figure 1d displayed the 
chromatogram of a 5-day fermentation broth, which also supported the possible 
presence of IA in the fermentation.  Noted that both of IA and lovastatin could be
