Abstract.  
This research aims to develop a new dry nano powder inverse imprint technology, and probe into transferring 
and replication of micro patterns. First, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mould surface, with micro patterns of 
grating structures, undergo activation treatment with oxygen plasma in order to improve mould surface energy, 
and thus, spin coat photoresist onto the surface more easily. Then, the surface is heated to restore its 
hydrophobicity, and by means of nano powder, micro patterns are transfer printed onto the 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Research results show that dry nano powder soft coat transferring and 
forming technology can accurately reproduce the required patterns. In the experiment, gas assisted nano 
powder imprint technology is used to apply even pressure, coupled with even temperature rise for 
solidification, then, patterns can be effectively transfer printed and completely formed. Further, these patterns 
are in perfect contact with the PMMA surface, thus, greatly increasing the valid imprint area and enhancing 
transferring reproductiveness. The technology integrates technologies, such as, soft lithography, solidifying 
photoresist, and gas assisted pressure application, and is utilized to transfer print micro patterns in a grating 
structure, and thus, complete the transferring process of dry micro structure patterns.

1. Introduction 
PDMS is a kind of soft material. It can precisely reproduce complementary shapes of micro structures, and 
has the high transmittance of 95%. In early 1980, a professor from Harvard University, George M. Whitesides, 
first applied a soft coat to the imprinting process, and invented soft lithography. Later, Whitesides succeeded 
in developing micro patterns with 5nm line width. In recent years, Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) [1] 
integrated UV-NIL [2-5], and its principle is as follows: relying on the traditional imprint concept, pressure is 
applied onto the core of nanostructure to force contact between the basal plate and the formed material, until 
the formed material (photoresist, which can be solidified by UV) produces nanostructure patterns 
complementing the core. The dimension for this technology to directly process patterns corresponds to the 
dimension characteristic of the mould. In comparison with optical lithography, this technology is not subject 
to restrictions regarding optical exposure waves. Therefore, in terms of industrial applications, nano imprint 
technology is superior to currently existing nano forming technologies (e.g. E-beam, Focus Ion Beam, etc.) 
[6], and thus, it is the best choice for producing various nano-grade optical components.

process is divided into the following steps, as shown in Figure 4: (a) oxygen plasma is 
used for the surface treatment of a PDMS mould in order to improve surface energy and 
transform it into a hydrophilic surface; (b) EPG-510 photoresist is evenly applied on the 
PDMS mould structural surface, by inverse spin coating and an automatic scraping 
mechanism; (c) the PDMS soft mould, applied with photoresist, is heated and pre-baked 
in order to transform the PDMS mould from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity, and thus, 
facilitate the subsequent transferring ink onto the PMMA; (d) the PDMS mould is placed 
in a gas assisted nano powder imprint film chamber, and nitrogen and nano powder are 
used to apply pressure evenly and completely for an appropriate forming pressure, and the 
temperature is properly raised to improve PMMA surface energy, and thus, force the 
photoresist to be completely transfer printed onto the PMMA; (e) the mould is removed 
upon complete photoresist patterns transfer. This research employs dry nano powder 
inverse imprint technology, and utilizes parameters, such as, a 3500 rpm spin coating rate, 
40s spin coating, 35N/cm2 transferring pressure, 150s transferring time, and 125°C 
transferring temperature; effect of different spin coating speed on the replicated forming 
thickness, as shown in Figure 5. As a result show that micro array patterns, replicated by 
the above-mentioned steps, achieve considerably good effects, as indicated in the Figure 6 
SEM graph of transferring results. 
3. Results and discussion 
In this research, PDMS surface undergoes oxygen plasma treatment in order to provide its surface 
with hydrophilicity, and then easily applies EPG-510 photoresist; then, the surface is heated to restore its 
hydrophobicity; nano powder assisted imprint technology is used to transfer the imprinting force, and 
finally, the original micro grating assay structure transfer printed is transfer printed onto the PMMA 
surface. In the following, results of various experiments and their influences on the imprinting process 
are discussed 
3.1  Effect on PDMS surface contact angle before and after oxygen plasma treatment  
This research discusses the PDMS surface contact angle before and after oxygen plasma treatment. 
Experimental results show that the PDMS surface has hydrophilicity, upon a treatment with oxygen 
plasma. Meanwhile, with fixed power, the PDMS surface contact angle is measured, with water as the 
medium, at room temperature. The results show that the surface contact angle varies with treatment time, 
as shown in Figure 7. Further, when a PDMS mould treated with oxygen plasma is placed at room 
temperature, with increased time, the surface contact angle will be decreased; namely, its hydrophilicity 
will be improved, as shown in Figure 8. The main cause for such a phenomenon is that, PDMS reacts 
with oxygen in the air, or the movements of hydrophilic functional groups lead to declined diffusion 
surface energy.  
3.2  Effect of different heating temperatures on PDMS surface contact angle after oxygen plasma treatment 
This research discusses PDMS surface contact angle at different heating temperatures, before and 
after oxygen plasma treatments. Experimental results show that, when surface contact angle is measured, 
with water as the medium, at room temperature, with increased heating temperature of the PDMS mould, 
the surface contact angle is raised, as shown in Figure 9. This indicates that as the temperature is
