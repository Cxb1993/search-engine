摘要
In order to improve the optical transparency and organosolubility of aromatic
polyimides derived from 4,4’-oxydianiline (4,4’-ODA), two new aromatic diamines,
2,2’-diiodo-4,4’-oxydianiline (DI-ODA) and
2,2’-bis[(p-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4,4’-oxydianiline (BTFP-ODA) were synthesized by
using 4,4’-ODA as a starting material. Novel polyimides were prepared from these two
diamines with various commercially available aromatic dianhydrides via a one-step
high-temperature polycondensation procedure. Most of these polyimides showed enhanced
solubility in common organic solvents compared with those corresponding polyimides
derived from 4,4’-ODA. Especially, polyimide derived from BTFP-ODA and rigid
pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) was also soluble in DMF, DMAc, DMSO, NMP and
m-cresol at room temperature. These polyimides had inherent viscosities from 0.41 to 1.26
dLg-1 in NMP or m-cresol at 30 °C. Transparent, flexible and tough films can be obtained by
casting from their DMAc or m-cresol solutions. These films had the UV onset wavelengths in
the range of 347-391 nm and the wavelengths at 80% transmission of 445-544 nm, indicating
high optical transparency. They also exhibited good thermal stability with glass transition
temperatures in the range of 260-327 °C. The decomposition temperatures of these
polyimides at 5% weight loss under nitrogen were 429-609 °C. Because of the weak
carbon-iodine bond, polyimides derived from DI-ODA decomposed at lower temperatures
than polyimides derived from BTFP-ODA. The efects of the substituents at the 2 and 2’ 
positions of 4,4’-ODA on the properties of polyimides are also discussed. One of these
polyimides 11b derived containing four bromides showed the highest refractive index of 1.71.
High optical transparency and good solubility combined with high thermal stability make
these polyimides potential candidates for soft electronics applications.

these bulky substituents. The increased free volume facilitates the penetration of small
solvent molecules into polyimide chains, leading to the excellent solubility. From Table II, it
also indicates that polyimides 7 exhibited better solubility than polyimides 6. For example,
when ODPA was used, polyimide 7d can be dissolved in all tested solvents except acetone at
room temperature, while polyimide 6d was only soluble in high boiling-point, polar solvents
such as DMAc, DMSO, NMP and m-cresol. The better solubility of polyimides 7 compared
to that of polyimides 6 could be resulted from the more bulky p-trifluoromethylphenyl
substituent. This result also confirms the positive effect of bulky substituents on improving
the solubility of polyimides.
聚醯亞胺之熱性質
The thermal properties of polyimides 6 and 7 were evaluated by TMA and TGA. The
results, including glass transition temperatures (Tg), coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE),
decomposition temperatures at 5% (T5%) and 10% (T10%) weight loss and residual weight
percent (Rw800) at 800 °C. The Tgs of polyimides 6b~f were in the range of 271-327 °C and
those of polyimides 7a~f were in the range of 260-306 °C. The effect of different
dianhydrides on the Tgs depends on their rigidity. In general, polyimides derived from ODPA
with flexible ether linkage, such as 6d and 7d, show the lowest Tgs among these polyimides.
The Tgs of polyimides 7b~f were ten to fifty degrees (°C) lower than those of polyimides
6b~f when the same dianhydrides were used. For example, the Tg of polyimide 6e is about 51
°C higher than that of polyimide 7e as shown in Figure 1. This might be resulted from the
more bulky p-trifluoromethylphenyl substituents of polyimides 7, which hinder the chain
packing and increase the free volume more than iodide substituents of polyimides 6. The Tgs
of polyimides 6 and 7 are comparable to those of polyimides derived from 4,4’-ODA. For
example, the Tg of 6FDA-ODA polyimide is 296 °C,2-4 those of polyimides 6f and 7f are 295
and 271 °C, respectively.
The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) determined by TMA at temperature
between 50 and 150 °C. The CTEs of polyimides 6b~f ranged between 35 and 49 ppm/°C.
Polyimides 7a~f exhibited the CTEs between 44 and 82 ppm/°C. Polyimides containing rigid
PMDA and BPDA moieties, such as 6b, 7a and 7b, showed lower CTEs. The higher CTEs of
polyimides 7 compared with those of polyimides 6 can be also attributed to the increased free
volume resulted from more bulky p-trifluoromethylphenyl substituents.
The thermal degradation temperatures (T5% at 5% and T10% at 10% weight loss) and
residual weight percent at 800 °C (Rw800) determined by TGA in a nitrogen atmosphere. The
decomposition temperatures, T5% and T10% of polyimides 6, were in the range of 429-466 °C
and 452-492 °C, respectively. Polyimides 7 had their T5% and T10% between 534-609 °C and
563-639 °C, respectively. The char yields of these polyimides were in the range of 31-64% in
nitrogen at 800 °C. The iodide substituted polyimides 6 began to decompose at 100 °C lower
than the corresponding p-trifluoromethylphenyl substituted polyimides 7. For example, the
T5% of polyimide 6e is at 437 °C while that of polyimide 7e is 534 °C as shown in Figure 1.
This is possibly attributed to the lower carbon-iodine bond energy. The chemical bond
energies of carbon-iodine, carbon-bromine, carbon-hydrogen and carbon-fluorine are 240,
276, 413 and 441 KJ/mol, respectively.5 It is concluded that the chemical bond energy of the
carbon-halogen bond played an important role in the thermal degradation of polyimides 6 and
7.
聚醯亞胺之機械與光學特性
Except 6a, these polyimides can be cast to form transparent and flexible films from
m-cresol (6b and 7b) and DMAc solution. The polyimide films had tensile strengths of 38-87
MPa, elongations at break of 4.5-7.9 % and initial moduli of 0.9-2.2 GPa. These values are

might increase the polarizability, however, the chain packing is thus disrupted. The
improved solubilities of polyimides 10 and 11 might be the indication of loose chain packing.
The difference in refractive indices between polyimides 10 and 11 was not obvious.
The values of birefringence for the polyimides 10b~f and 11a~f, taken as the difference
between in-plane(nTE) and out-of-plane(nTM) refractive indices, ranged from 0.0445 to 0.0098.
Due to the in-plane orientation of polyimide chains, the in-plane refractive indices were
always larger than out-plane ones. In-plane orientation has been shown to be more
pronounced for polyimides with higher chain rigidity. Polyimides 10b and 11b derived from
BPDA exhibited higher birefringence, while polyimides 10f and 11f derived from 6FDA
showed lower birefringence.
結論
In this study, we report the synthesis of two new aromatic diamines,
2,2’-diiodo-4,4’-oxydianiline (DI-ODA 4) and
2,2’-bis[p-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4,4’-oxydianiline (BTFP-ODA 5) by using 4,4’-ODA as
the starting material. These new diamines contain ether linkage and bulky iodide or
p-trifluoromethylphenyl substituents. In order to precisely control the substituents at the 2
and 2’ positions, the starting material, 4,4’-ODA, was oxidized first so that the following
iodination can take place at these positions. Novel polyimides 6 and 7 were prepared from
these two diamines with various commercially available aromatic dianhydrides via a one-step
polycondensation procedure. These polyimides had high molecular weights and film-forming
ability. Polyimides 6 and 7 exhibited enhanced solubilities compared with polyimides derived
from 4,4’-ODA. Polyimides 7 had better solubilities, lower glass transition temperatures and
showed lighter color than polyimides 6. This might be due to the more bulky
p-trifluoromethylphenyl substituents of polyimides 7 compared with iodide substituents of
polyimides 6. Polyimide 7a derived from rigid PMDA and BTFP-ODA 5 was even soluble in
DMF, DMAc, DMSO and NMP. These polyimides also exhibited good thermal stability.
Because of the presence of weak carbon-iodine bond, polyimides 6 began to decompose at
lower temperature than polyimides 7.
在本次研究計畫中，原本預計將聚醯亞胺薄膜的折射率與雙折量測完畢並加以探
討。但是由於原來的合作機構(工業研究院)正逢組織改組且儀器損壞不及修復，因此，
部份聚醯亞胺之折射率與雙折無法如期完成。
