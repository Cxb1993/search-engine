在 WDM 光通訊網路，可重組態
（reconfigurable）光學加取多工器是非常
重要的元件，它除了可動態加取多個波長
頻道於單一光資訊埠（如光纖）內，在多
通訊埠系統中，基本上它的功能就像是一
個選頻光切換器。近年來，利用光學微共
振腔去實現光學加取多工器在實驗上已有
相當的成果，但多半的加取多工器都是固
定不可調的，在本計劃中，我們提案在絕
緣矽（silicon-on-insulator）上實現一多埠、
可重組態的微加取多工器。此多工器是以
光微碟共振腔（microdisk resonator）作為
架構元件，並整合微加熱器及微機電系
統。應用微加熱器，光微碟可在共振波長
上作微調，而透過微機電系統改變微碟與
光波導的耦合（coupling），光訊號可在通
道上做動態加取。與其他只利用改變波長
來加取光訊號的可調式共振腔作比較，改
變光耦合在多通訊埠系統中更能減少串音
（crosstalk）及功率耗損（insertion loss）
的問題。而微加熱器本身可補償環境中的
溫度變化使系統的可靠度增加。由於每個
共振腔大小只有幾十個微米，因而可形成
極密集的微光學加取多工器。在製造觀點
上，因為體積小且可大量生產，因此降低
產品成本。從應用的角度來看，發展整合
微機電及微加熱器的可調式微碟共振腔，
除了可建立多埠、可重組態光學加取多工
器，其本身也可應用在可調式光學延遲
（tunable optical delay） 及可調式色散補
償（tunable dispersion compensation）。

Abstract 
 
Reconfigurable optical add-drop 
multiplexers (ROADMs) are very important 
optical components in wavelength division 
multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. They 
are capable of adding and dropping 
wavelength channels in a single optical 
communication port such as a fiber or a 
waveguide. Furthermore, in a multi-port 
optical system, they are inherently 
wavelength-selective optical switches. Over 
the past years, optical microresonators have 
been utilized to implement miniaturized 
optical add-drop multiplexers. However, 
most of devices are not tunable. In this 
project, we propose a reconfigurable 
multi-port optical micro add-drop 
multiplexer realized on SOI 
(silicon-on-insulator). It is constructed by 
many high-Q (quality factor) optical 
microdisk resonators which are integrated 
with microheaters and MEMS 
(Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) 
actuators. Microheaters are used to tune the 
resonant wavelengths. And MEMS actuators 
are used to vary the power coupling ratio 
between microdisks and waveguides, 
enabling a switching function for add-drop 
multiplexing. Compared with other 
resonators shifting resonant wavelengths for 
wavelength multiplexing, MEMS-actuated 
microdisk resonators directly modulate the 
coupling effect to achieve low crosstalk and 
low insertion loss in a multi-port optical 
communication system. In addition, 
microheaters could compensate temperature 
variation in environment, improving the 
 4
as 5 add-drop ports. The horizontal lines 
connecting the input ports and through ports 
are the data bus. And the vertical lines 
connecting the add ports and drop ports 
represents the wavelength channels. These 
vertical and horizontal lines are waveguides 
forming a 2-D mesh on the physical device. 
Microdisks are employed around the 
intersections of waveguides. The resonant 
wavelength of each microdisk is designed to 
match a specific wavelength channel. Thus, 
the wavelengths can be either dropped from 
or added to the data bus through the 
microdisks if the microdisks approach to the 
intersections of the waveguide grid. 
Otherwise, the wavelengths keep propagating 
on the waveguides if the microdisks are far 
from the intersections. The position of each 
microdisk can be individually controlled by 
MEMS actuators. The advantage of this 
scheme is there is very little power leakage 
(<-28dB) across each intersection if the 
microdisk is not enabled. It can implement a 
hitless reconfiguration. Additionally, the loss 
is merely accumulated by the port number 
and the crosstalk could be reduced. All the 
waveguides and microdisks are 
monolithically integrated on the same 
substrate. To make this device fully 
reconfigurable, we need to develop two 
independent tuning mechanisms for each 
microdisk. One is tuning the power coupling 
ratios between waveguides and disks and the 
other is tuning the resonant wavelengths of 
microdisks. Tuning the power coupling ratio 
switches the wavelength from one waveguide 
to the other waveguide. On the other hand, 
the resonant wavelength has to be finely 
tuned to match the wavelength channel in 
WDM.

(A). Tunable Coupling by Gap Variation    
An elementary microdisk add-drop filter 
is depicted in Fig. 2. There are four optical 
ports defined at the ends of two waveguides 
according to the propagation flow. The 
optical transmission at each port depends on 
the resonant frequency, the resonator loss 
and the power coupling ratio between the 
waveguide and disk. To analyze the optical 
transmission, the microdisk is modeled with 
a resonant frequency at ω0 and a round-trip 
resonator loss γ. The round-trip resonator 
loss is approximately equal to 2πRα where R 
is the radius and α is the propagation loss. 
The power coupling ratio between the disk 
and waveguide is denoted by κ. According to 
the time-domain coupling theory [9], the 
optical transfer functions of the waveguide 
are formulated as

 Eq. (2)
where Fit and Fid are the transfer functions 
from the input port to the through port and 
the drop port, respectively. κ1 and κ2 are the 
power coupling ratios of waveguide 1 and 2. 
T is the round-trip propagation time. Among 
these parameters, ω0 is determined by the 
size and the refractive index of disk, and γ is 
correlated to the material absorption and 
radiation. On the other hand, κ is dependent 
on the gap spacing between the waveguide 
and microdisk. As shown in Eq. (1), the 
optical transmittance of resonant wavelength 
primarily relies on the ratio of round-trip 
resonator loss and power coupling. To 
achieve a large power transfer from input 
port to the drop port, both the power 
coupling ratios, κ1 and κ2, have to be equal 
and much larger than the resonator loss. 
Directly varying the gap spacing is very 
efficient for tuning the power coupling ratio.

and the refractive index. For a silicon 
microdisk with 30-µm radius, the variation of 
resonant wavelength by radius is about 40 
nm/µm. From the tolerance of 
microfabrication, it is challenging to control 
the dimension precisely within 100 nm. On 
the other hand, the refractive index is also 
affected by temperature. To solve these 
issues, we plan to integrate the 
MEMS-actuated microdisk with a 
microheater, which not only compensates the 
radius variation but also regulates the 
microdisk temperature. The device schematic 
is illustrated in Fig. 4. A microheater, 
consisting of a serpentine metal line and 
electrodes, is employed close to a microdisk. 
The temperature is thus controlled by voltage 
or current applied on the heater. Each 
microdisk has a microheater so the resonant 
wavelength can be tuned independently.

resonator integrated with a microheater. Bias Va is 
applied for deforming waveguides while bias Vh is 
applied for tuning the temperature.  
The steady-state temperature of the 
heated microdisk depends on the applied 
voltage, thermal conductivity and heat 
capacity of materials, and ambient 
temperature. Theoretical analysis is done by 
a commercialized simulation tool (ANSYS). 
We suppose the microheater is made of 
platinum with 2-µm linewidth and 300-nm 
thickness. The schematic model is drawn in 
Fig. 5(a). For simplicity, the microdisk is 
presented by a square silicon piece with 
0.7-µm thickness, sitting on the silicon 
substrate with a spacer made of 1-µm SiO2. 
The in-plane separation between the disk and 
the heater is 15 µm, and the ambient 
temperature is set by 25°C. As the biased 
voltage increases to 3V, the temperature of 
the whole device increases. The simulated 
temperature distribution is shown in Fig. 5(b). 
Different colors represent different 
temperature ranges. As shown in this figure, 
the temperature is highest at the center of 
microheater and decays eccentrically. The 
heater temperature is about 84°C and it 
reduces to 36°C on the microdisk. According 
to the result, we can implement a 
voltage-controlled temperature regulator.

with 300-nm thickness and 2-m width. In (b), 
temperature of the microdisk increases to 36°C with 
3-V bias. 
Thermo-optic effect has been widely 
used in planar lightwave circuits (PLCs). The 
thermal properties of silicon include a 
 8
decreased to 0.26 µm, while a 1-µm SiO2 
film was grown on top of the silicon after the 
thermal oxidation. The top surfaces of the 
oxidized SOI and the patterned SOI were 
subsequently bonded for one hour in a high 
temperature (900°C) furnace. The substrate 
and the BOX layer of the second SOI wafer 
were removed by mechanical lapping 
combined with chemical etching process 
until only the thin silicon film remained on 
the microdisk, with the coated SiO2 as a 
spacer. To accomplish well coupling in our 
device, the waveguide patterns are precisely 
aligned to the microdisk through a Nikon 
stepper. After the waveguides were 
fabricated by etching the top silicon film, a 
serpentine pattern of microheater was formed 
by metal deposition. The wafer was then 
coated with a photoresist as a mask for 
releasing windows. The wafer was further 
diced into test samples, and each sample was 
immersed into diluted HF (6:1) to release the 
waveguides while keep other components on 
the substrate. Finally, the photoresist was 
removed with acetone, and the sample was 
dried in a critical-point drying process. Fig. 8 
shows the SEM image of the fabricated 
device. The microdisk and the electrodes are 
in the bottom layers, and the two waveguides 
and electrical shields are in the top layers. 
The disk radius is 20 µm with a thickness of 
0.25 µm. The released length of the 
waveguide is 100 µm long and the 
waveguide width and thickness were 
measured to be 0.8 µm and 0.26 µm, 
respectively. The as-fabricated gap spacing 
between waveguide and disk is 1 µm.

Fig. 8 Optical and scanning electron micrograph of the 
fabricated device  
To examine this function, we launch a 
broad-band light source to the input port and 
measure the optical power at the through port 
and the drop port, respectively. Both 
waveguides are actuated with the same 
applied voltage. Fig. 9(a) shows the spectral 
responses at the through port and the drop 
port without bias. The power coupling ratio 
is minute for both waveguides due to a large 
gap-spacing (1 µm). In such a case, all the 
power is transferred to the through port.  As 
the applied voltage increases to 30 V, the 
power decreases at the through port as the 
signal is transferred to the drop port at the 
resonant wavelength. The results are shown 
in Fig. 9(b). 
Fig. 9(c) plots the optical transmission 
versus the applied voltage for both the 
through port and the drop part, at the 
resonant wavelength of 1,555.46 nm. A 
20-dB extinction ratio is observed by varying 
the bias from 0 V (decoupled) to 35 V 
(intensely-coupled). At the threshold voltage 
of about 19V, the sum of the power at the 
through port and the drop port is not equal to 
the input power, as about 28% of the input 
power is consumed in the microdisk. It 
results from the resonator loss as the 
microdisk operates near the critical coupling 
condition (γ = κ), where the optical field 
intensity is maximal inside the disk. If the 
electrodes are switched between 0 V and 35 
V, this device can be utilized as a dynamic 
add-drop filter.
