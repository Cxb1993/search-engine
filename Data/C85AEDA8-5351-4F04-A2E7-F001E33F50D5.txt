Abstract  
This study investigates the appropriateness and effectiveness of the design of 
icons for a Chinese web browser. Web browser developments are outlined, 
 2
popular of these have been Netscape Navigator (c.1994) and Internet Explorer (85% 
market share worldwide) (c.1995) for the PC, and Safari (c.2003) for the Mac. 
 
The graphical user interface, including the toolbars, menu bars and scrollbars with 
which the user is familiar, is applied to all Web browsers. By double-clicking on the 
iconic buttons on the web desktop, users can surf through web pages, which connect to 
the URL, HTTP supports the transmission between the web server and web browser, 
and HTML/XML that displays hypertext or hypermedia links. In terms of the Web 
metaphor there are aesthetic similarities between all web browsers, which indicate 
certain functions on the toolbar such as the Back, Forward, Stop, Refresh and Home 
icons (see Fig. 1). 
 
 
Figure. 1. Internet Explorer web browser interface for the Macintosh Version 5.2. 
From the latest Macintosh OS X and Windows XP there appears to be a trend of 
integrating software and operating system in the evolution of the interface. The 
Leopard interface of the Apple Macintosh operating system and Vista interface of the 
Microsoft Windows XP operating system have some similarities, i.e. the 3D icons 
which are smooth, translucent, colourful and big, a range of customisation for desktop 
management and multimedia internet tools. In particular, the display of the desktop 
has developed into a browser like-window. 
 
三、 方法與測試 
The test website consisted of the design of a Chinese Operating System (COS) 
environment, developed to act as an alternative to the desktop metaphor, involving the 
‘Garden’ as an overarching metaphor. The COS was designed to be culturally rich, and 
have both visual and aural stimuli. The study investigated the recognition and 
acceptance of intuitive icons for the web browser element of the Garden COS. The 
testing involved online evaluation, screen recording and user feedback. 
3.1 Participants 
The study was conducted in Taiwan during June 2006 and involved 20 participants 
(60% male, 40% female) who were recruited from 1st and 2nd year BA Multimedia 
Design students studying at the National Formosa University. The ages ranged from 
 4
fable, however, there was mixed agreement as to whether the use of this visual 
representation was appropriate. 
 
The answers to the following eight questions were based on the five point Likert Scale 
(1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree), and 
related to whether the participants agreed that the icons were representative of the 
functions. In this context, overall the participants agreed (mean ≈ 4) with the icons for 
Back, Forward, Home and Stop. This was consistent with the answers for the 
pre-experiment questionnaire. The participants were neutral regarding the Go/Visit 
icon (mean 3.14), and broadly neutral regarding the Search, Refresh and Favourite 
icons (mean 2.69). It is also interesting to note that overall the male participants from 
Groups A and B (SD=0.84) had much higher mean standard deviations than the female 
participants from Groups A and B (SD=0.50), thus indicating their greater levels of 
disagreement between participants. The answers to questions 6 & 8 produced the 
highest mean standard deviations (0.85 & 0.81), however, it is noted that these are less 
than unity, and therefore acceptable. 
 
Overall, both groups could be classified as having a preference between neutral and 
agree, with the females (mean 3.55) slightly higher than the males (mean 3.37). 
 
Questions 11 and 12 (multiple parts) related to tasks within the browser favourites 
section. With regards to Question 11, both groups were able to complete the tasks 
successfully within a 71-95% range. The result of Question 12 to 12.2 indicated that 
both groups would prefer to interact with icons and text (89%), followed by icons-only 
(45%), and then text-only (17%). This supports hypothesis H2, and is in agreement 
with the results of Choong and Salvendy [3] and Horton [4].  
 
The overall satisfaction of the participants was broadly neutral to agree (mean 3.32).  
 
Question 13 and 14 enabled the participants to give written feedback on the overall 
advantages and disadvantages of the Chinese web browser interface design in terms of 
usability. The written feedback for Question 13 was entirely positive with the use of 
words such as creative and meaningful from Group A and words such as interesting, 
innovative and fresh from Group B, which supports hypothesis H4. They also 
commented on the fact that they liked the ‘computer game’ feel of the interface design. 
The written feedback from Question 14 highlighted the weakness of visual 
representation using icons-only.
