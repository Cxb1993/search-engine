Antioxidants inhibit or prevent oxidation of a substrate,
and evolve to protect biological systems against damage
induced by reactive oxygen species. Among the sources of
natural antioxidants, mushrooms are now being considered
to be a rich source of antioxidants (Elmastas et al. 2006).
Some of polysaccharide extracts from edible fungi have
been found to be useful candidates in the search for
effective, non-toxic substances with free radical scaveng-
ing activity (Lin et al. 2010b; Liu et al. 1997). Following
this way, the antiproliferative activity of exopolysaccharide
(EPS) extract of G. frondosa was undertaken.
Many edible and medicinal mushrooms that produce
polysaccharides respond to nutritional conditions which
determined by the degree of polysaccharide formation
(Jonathan and Fasidi 2001; Kim et al. 2002; Lin and Chen
2007). Previous works have illustrated that the some
nutritional factors have limited effects by various edible
mushrooms (Lee et al. 2004; Cui et al. 2006; Yang et al.
2010). Some researchers have focused their studies on the
effect of oils and surfactants of G. frondosa (Hsieh et al.
2006, 2008). However, their effects on antioxidant and
antiproliferative activities of exopolysaccharide are not
available so far. The objectives of this study were to
investigate antioxidant activity by using superoxide anion
scavenging activity and reducing power and antiprolifera-
tive activity, and to examine the effectiveness on the yields
of mycelial biomass and ESP production by submerged
culture of a newly screened strain, G. frondosa TFRI1073
which caused by the different composite medium.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Yeast extract, malt exact and peptone were purchased from
Difco (Detroit, MI USA). Phenazine methosulfate (PMS),
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), nitroblue tet-
razolium (NBT) and 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(4-phenyl-sul-
fonic acid)-1,2,4-triazine (Ferrozine) were obtained from
Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO USA). Ferric chloride
was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). 4-[3-(4-
Iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzen
disulfonate (WST-1) was purchased from Roche Molecular
Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). All other chemicals
used were of analytical grade and obtained from either
Sigma–Aldrich or Merck.
Organism and inoculums
Grifola frondosa TFRI1073 used in this study was obtained
from the western mountain area of Taiwan and were
authenticated by Dr. Tun-Tschu Chang (Taiwan Forestry
Research Institute, Taipei, Taiwan). The cultures were
maintained on potato dextrose agar and were transferred
every 14 days under the growing condition of 25C. The
medium of liquid culture contained (g L-1) glucose 10,
yeast extract 3, malt exact 3, peptone 5, thiamine 1,
KH2PO4 1 and MgSO47H2O 1. The fine mycelia of
G. frondosa on the medium surface were cut into five
pieces (0.5 cm approximately) and they were transferred to
the culture flasks. Fermentation was carried out in a
250 mL Erlenmeyer flask which was fitted with a silicone
plug and contained 50 mL medium (autoclaving was done
at 121C for 20 min). The flasks were inoculated as above
and incubated on a Firstek Scientific rotary shaker (Model
S300R) at 150 rpm and 25C for 7 days.
Shake flask cultures
To monitor the effect that the carbon sources has on the
mycelial biomass and EPS production, the malt extract and
yeast extract, which were considered as supplying only
glucose, were replaced by the equal-carbon content.
Replacing peptone with various nitrogen sources, on an
equal-nitrogen content basis, allowed the effect of nitrogen
sources to be assessed. The effects of growing factors and
mineral sources on the mycelial biomass and EPS pro-
duction were studied individually. These data were
obtained by using 50 mL of basal medium at an initial pH
5.5, at 25C, and with agitation at 150 rpm for 7 days. All
experiments were carried out at least in triplicate to ensure
reproducibility.
Preparation of polysaccharides
Samples collected at various intervals from fermentation
broth were filtered through membrane filtration (No. 1,
Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). The resulting culture filtrate was
mixed with four volumes of 95% ethanol, stirred vigorously
and at 4C for further overnight. The precipitated exo-
polysaccharide was collected by centrifugation at 10,000g
for 15 min at 4C, and the supernatant was discarded. The
precipitated of exopolysaccharide was freeze-dried in a
lyophilizer. Total exopolysaccharide concentrations in the
ethanolic extracts were measured by using the phenol–sul-
furic acid method (Dubois et al. 1956). The main values and
the standard deviation were calculated from the data
obtained with triplicate trials. Dry weights of mycelium was
determined after repeated washing of the mycelia pellets
with distilled water and dried overnight at 60C.
Antioxidant activity assays
Measurement of superoxide anion scavenging ability was
evaluated according to Nishikimi et al. (1972) with
World J Microbiol Biotechnol
123
effect and polysaccharide to antioxidant activity is con-
centration-dependent. Mau et al. (2004) found that meth-
anolic extracts from mycelia of G. frondosa showed no
reducing power at 0.5–1.0 mg mL-1, whereas reducing
powers of the extracts were 0.30–0.37 at 5.0 mg mL-1.
The reducing power of methanolic extract of fruit bodies of
G. frondosa was 0.5 at 3.0 mg mL-1 (Mau et al. 2002).
The reducing powers in this study seemed to be much more
effective than that from its mycelia and fruit bodies.
However, reducing powers of BHA and a-tocopherol at 3.6
and 8.6 mg mL-1 were 0.12 and 0.13, respectively (Mau
et al. 2002). Above-mentioned results showed the reducing
power of G. frondosa extracts were higher than the extracts
of BHA and a-tocopherol. Other researchers have observed
a positive correlation between antioxidant activities and
reducing power for certain mushrooms extracts (Mau et al.
2002).
Measurement of cell proliferation
The exopolysaccharide extract of G. frondosa showed the
positive relative activity of cell proliferation by A549 cell
of 86.80% at 200 lg mL-1 and a maximum relative
activity of 52.96% at 800 lg mL-1, resulting in the dose-
depending relationship between 0 and 120 lg mL-1
(Fig. 2). A549 cell proliferation was inhibited in a dose-
dependent manner at 200–800 lg mL-1. This experiment
suggests that the antiproliferative activity was directly
correlated to the exopolysaccharide concentrations. Grifola
frondosa extracts had moderate antiproliferative activities
by A549 cell. However, MDA-MD-231 cells also showed a
linear positive relative antiproliferative activity between 0
and 600 lg mL-1 and slightly activity of cell proliferation
of 80.25% at 800 lg mL-1.
Effect of carbon sources
Many edible mushrooms that produce polysaccharides
respond to nutritional conditions determine the degree of
exo-biopolymer formation. So far, the role and effects of
growth factor, including carbon and nitrogen source, vitamin
and inorganic salt, on the mycelial biomass and EPS pro-
duction of a newly screened strain G. frondosa TFRI1073
have not been reported. As indicated in Fig. 3, G. frondosa
TFRI1073 appeared to be able to grow over various carbon
sources, but the carbon sources for mycelial biomass
and EPS production were distinct. At different carbon
sources tested, the maximal EPS production was obtained in
medium supplemented by fructose (0.66 ± 0.07 g L-1),
followed by galactose (0.64 ± 0.06 g L-1) and xylose
(0.51 ± 0.03 g L-1). However, galactose stimulated the
greatest mycelial biomass (2.04 ± 0.32 g L-1) in G. frondosa
TFRI1073. This result is not in good agreement with the
results reported by other investigators, who evaluated the
most suitable carbon source was glucose of Korea
G. frondosa (Lee et al. 2004) and G. frondosa GF9801
(Cui et al. 2006). All of these carbon sources, however,
resulted in significantly lower specific product yields
(0.26–0.31 g g-1), expect for fructose (0.48 g g-1), relative
to that of the control flask (0.41 g g-1), which lacked a
carbon source supplement. In this investigation, results
showed that the profile of EPS production with respect to the
carbon source generally was not consistent with that of the
mycelial biomass of G. frondosa TFRI1073. Similar results
were reported in fermentation of other higher fungi (Kim
et al. 2002).
Effect of nitrogen sources
Among the different nitrogen sources examined, ammo-
nium oxalate was the most effective sources for enhancing
the EPS production (0.61 ± 0.05 g L-1) by G. frondosa
TFRI1073 (Fig. 4a). The mycelial biomass appeared to be

were obtained in K3PO4 and NaH2PO4 cultures; reached
about 2.14 ± 0.12 and 0.71 ± 0.02 g L-1, respectively.
The results illustrate only a little difference in mycelial
biomass and EPS production among these phosphate ions.
The inorganic salts appeared to have a significant effect
on both mycelial biomass and EPS production (Fig. 6b).
The three most effective inorganic salts for mycelial bio-
mass, EPS production and specific product yield in the
medium were FeSO4 (2.88 ± 0.16 g L
-1), KCl (0.79 ±
0.07 g L-1) and CaCl2 (0.59 g g
-1), respectively. These
trace mineral sources are known to influence the exo-
biopolymer production of other mushroom mycelia
(Jonathan and Fasidi 2001; Lin and Sung 2006).
Conclusions
The results clearly showed that G. frondosa TFRI1073
exopolysaccharide extracts showed good antioxidant and
slight antiproliferative activities by using two different in
vitro antioxidant activity testing systems and two cell
culture assays. Therefore, the exopolysaccharide extract of
G. frondosa TFRI1073 may be developed as a new dietary
supplement and functional food. In this investigation,
results showed that the mycelial biomass and EPS pro-
duction of a newly screened G. frondosa TFRI1073 can be
enhanced significantly by the means of controlling the
culture conditions and modifying the medium composition.
In other words, nutrients can be utilized to improve the
production of exopolysaccharide.

Abstract Effects of nutritional requirements for
superoxide anion scavenging activity and reducing power
by a newly screened Grifola frondosa TFRI1073 were
studied in submerged cultures. The results clearly showed
that the culture medium significantly affected superoxide
anion scavenging activity and reducing power. In addition,
both superoxide anion scavenging capability and reducing
power were found to be greatly affected by varying the
carbon source, the nitrogen source, the growth factor, and
the mineral elements. The best superoxide anion scavenging
activity could be obtained when the medium compositions
(carbon source, nitrogen source, growth factor, and the
mineral elements) were sucrose, ammonium chloride,
nicotinic acid, K3PO4, and CuSO4; while a maximal
reducing power could be achieved when the medium
composition setting as: xylose, arginine, ascorbic acid,
K2HPO4, and MgSO4. From a series experiments, the
maximal superoxide anion scavenging activity and reducing
power were 98.36±0.59% and 0.947±0.06 at 100 µg/mL,
respectively. This study proved that modifying the
composition of the medium can dramatically enhance the
superoxide anion scavenging ability and reducing power
by a newly screened G. frondosa TFRI1073.

Introduction
Many mushrooms have recently become attractive as a
functional food. Grifola frondosa is a Basidiomycete
fungus belonging to the order Aphyllophorales, and the
family Polyporeceae. Their fruiting bodies, which are
called ‘huishu hua’ in China and ‘maitake’ in Japan, which
has recently attracted considerable attention for its various
physiological activities, such as antitumor, antiinflammatory,
antioxidant, hypoglycemic, hypocholesterolemic, and
immunostimulating activities (1-6). G. frondosa has
become an increasingly popular food in recent years in
Taiwan and Japan because of its bioactive ingredients. It
contains a polysaccharide compound β-glucan not found in
other types of mushroom, and β-glucan is reported to help
strengthen the body’s natural immune system and improve
general health (7,8). Traditional edible mushrooms are
generally produced in solid culture using composts or
lignocellulosis wastes such as straws or wood, and it
usually takes 4-6 months to culture its fruiting body. It is
generally recognized that, growing mushroom mycelia in a
defined medium by submerged fermentation is a rapid and
alternative method to obtain fugal biomass of consistent
quality. In addition to the health benefits, G. frondosa have
a distinctive rich, woody flavor and firm, meaty texture.
Usually, the fruiting body of G. frondosa is dried to extend
the shelf-life. Moreover, dry fruiting body of G. frondosa
has been used in the production of health foods, including
tea, whole powder, powders of hot water extracts, granules,
and drinks (9). The fruiting body and submerged liquid-
cultured mycelium of this fungus have been reported to
contain useful antitumor polysaccharides from various
fractions (10-12). Furthermore, antioxidant activities of
polysaccharides obtained from submerged cultures of G.
frondosa have been well characterized in terms of chemical
features and biological activity (6,13).
Oxidation is essential to many living organisms for the
production of energy to fuel biological processes. Oxidative
stress can be defined as the state in which the balance

total volume of 1 mL of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH
7.4). After 5 min of incubation at ambient temperature,
absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at a
wavelength of 560 nm using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec
2100 pro; Amersham, Hong Kong). The superoxide anion
activity was calculated as scavenging effect (%)=(1−
absorbance of sample/absorbance of control)×100.
Reducing power assay The reducing power was determined
by the method of Chou et al. (24). The reaction mixture
contained the same volume (0.25 mL) of 200 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), 1%(w/v) potassium ferricyanide,
and 100 µg of polysaccharide equivalents/mL extract, and
the mixture was incubated at 50oC for 20 min. After 0.25
mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to the mixture
to stop the reaction. The mixture was centrifuged at 3,000
×g for 10 min. The supernatant (0.5 mL) was mixed with
0.4 mL of deionized water and 0.1 mL of 0.1%(w/v) ferric
chloride solution, allowed to stand for 30 min, and the
absorbance was measured at 700 nm. A higher absorbance
indicated a higher reducing power.
Statistical analysis The data presented are mean±standard
deviation (SD) of triplicate parallel determinations. Data
were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
Duncan’s multiple range tests (for comparison the
treatment means). Differences were considered significant
when p<0.05.
Results and Discussion
Effects of different carbon sources As critical nutrition
factors were an important of physiological control and
regulation of some mushrooms by submerged fermentation
(25-27). Various operating strategies have been evaluated
to improve the antioxidant properties of other mushroom
(28). The effects of 5 carbon sources on superoxide anion
scavenging activity and reducing power were investigated
in shaken flask cultures after 7 days incubation. In these
experiments, various carbon sources were used at a
concentration of 10 g/L in the basal culture medium. Table
1 shows the G. frondosa TFRI1073 by all tested carbon
sources were more superoxide anion scavenging activity
than glucose. This result is not in good agreement with the
results reported by other investigators, who evaluated the
most suitable carbon source was glucose by Korean G.
frondosa HB0071 (13) and Chinese G. frondosa GF9801
(29). In addition, xylose instigated highest reducing power
compared to other carbon sources. The maximal reducing
power in the cultures was about 0.682±0.06. The fungus
demonstrated the superoxide anion scavenging activity and
reducing power when using each of these carbohydrates as
carbon source, but to varying degrees. The superoxide
anion scavenging activity and reducing power was significant
among G. frondosa TFRI1073 for carbon sources (p<0.01).
It is known that the mycelia of G. frondosa can be grown,
to various extents, to over a wide range of carbon sources
(30,31).
Effects of different nitrogen sources The original
industrially used mycelial growth medium of mushroom
was containing both organic and inorganic nitrogen sources.
In this parallel study, the basal medium was supplemented
with 5 g/L of various organic (peptone, tryptone, casitone,
and soytone) and inorganic (ammonium acetate, ammonium
chloride, ammonium oxalate, ammonium sulfate, potassium
nitrate, and sodium nitrate) of nitrogenous sources. Table 2
illustrates the effect of various organic nitrogenous sources
on superoxide anion scavenging activity and reducing
power by G. frondosa TFRI1073. In the present investigation,
results showed that soytone resulted in the highest level of

edible mushroom (28). In addition, the maximal reducing
power was obtained by using ascorbic acid; its maximum
value increased to 0.622±0.05. The superoxide anion
scavenging activity and reducing power was significant
(p<0.01).
The effect of trace elements on superoxide anion
scavenging activity and reducing power by G. frondosa
TFRI1073 were shown in Table 5. In this study examined
the influences that various mineral elements have on
superoxide anion scavenging ability and reducing power in
the basal medium, instead of in KH2PO4 or MgSO4, at a
concentration of 1.0 g/L. Among different phosphate ion
tested of maximal superoxide anion scavenging activity
and reducing power were obtained in K3PO4 cultures and
reached about 72.44±1.84% and 2.14±0.12, respectively
(Table 5). The superoxide anion scavenging activity was
significant (p<0.01). There were not significant differences
among reducing power for phosphate ion. Further, Cui et
al. (29) found that the suitability of mineral elements was
KH2PO4 for effective production of biomass and exo-
polymer by G. frondosa GF9801. In contrast, Table 5
indicates that G. frondosa TFRI1073 was capable of
growing on all tested various inorganic salts with significant
differences on superoxide anion scavenging ability and
reducing power (p<0.01). At different mineral elements
tested, the maximal superoxide anion scavenging activity
was obtained in CuSO4 culture; its maximum value increased
to 98.36±0.59%. In addition, the maximal reducing power
of about 0.486±0.12 was obtained in the MgSO4-
supplemented culture, followed, in order, by the CaCl2
(0.425±0.06) and KCl (0.350±0.03) cultures. Actually, in
spite of a good mycelial growth in FeSO4 and FeCl3
cultures, the reducing power was low.
This study was conducted to investigate the effect of
nutritional components (carbon source, nitrogen source,
growth factor, and the mineral elements) on the antioxidant
properties by a newly screened strain, G. frondosa TFRI1073.
From a series experiments, the maximal superoxide anion
scavenging activity and reducing power by G. frondosa
TFRI1073 were 98.36±0.59% and 0.947±0.06 at 100 µg/
mL, respectively. In conclusion, added nutrients can be
utilized to improve the superoxide anion scavenging
activity and reducing power by G. frondosa TFRI1073. G.
frondosa TFRI1073 prepared could be developed as a new
dietary supplement and functional food.
