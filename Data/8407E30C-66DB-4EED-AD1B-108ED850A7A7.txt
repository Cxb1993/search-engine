Abstract 
In the present study, factors that influence 
the distribution and variation of 7Be in Hsinchu, 
Taiwan were elucidated. The 7Be activity 
including the deposition flux and air 
concentration was continuously monitored and 
recorded throughout a 15-year period (1996 - 
2011). To explain the observed variability in the 
7Be activity over time, air concentration and 
deposition flux of 7Be were correlated to rainfall 
and solar activity. The monthly average 
deposition flux and air concentration of 7Be 
were inversely related to solar activity with the 
11-year cycle and were not strongly correlated to 
rainfall. The highest seasonal deposition flux of 
7Be occurred in March, which is commonly 
referred to as the spring maximum, due to 
air-mass mixing processes in the troposphere. 
The air concentration of 7Be was seasonally 
variable and was significantly affected by 
monsoons. The lowest deposition flux and air 
concentration of 7Be were observed in July and 
August due to the occurrence of southwest 
monsoons from low latitudes, which carry air 
masses with low concentrations of 7Be. The 
deposition flux was enhanced by precipitation, 
which increased the deposition velocity, 
transferring more 7Be from the troposphere to 
the ground. The fraction of dry to total 
deposition varied seasonally and was equal to 
9.86 %, on average. The 7Be concentrations in 
surface air can be experimentally predicted from 
the PM concentrations based on CBe (mBq/m3) = 
0.0767 PM (g/m3) across seasons. The annual 
averages of the PM and 7Be concentrations are 
48.1 g/m3 and 3.7 mBq/m3, respectively.

2. Introduction 
Beryllium-7 (7Be) is a naturally occurring 
radionuclide produced by spallation reactions 
through interactions of galactic cosmic rays with 
nitrogen and oxygen in the stratosphere and 
upper troposphere. Production rates of 7Be and 
other cosmogenic radionuclides have been 
simulated in the earth’s atmosphere to determine 
their variation with latitude, solar activity and 
geomagnetic field intensity (Masarik and Beer, 
1999; Nagai et al., 2000; Usoskin and Kovaltsov, 
2008). The sunspot number is an indicator of 
solar activity, which can enhance the magnetic 
field surrounding the earth and reduce the 
intensity of cosmic rays and production rates of 
cosmogenic radionuclides in the atmosphere. 
After 7Be is formed, it rapidly associates with 
submicron-sized aerosol particles (Bondietti et 
al., 1984). The concentration of 7Be in the 
troposphere is altitude and latitude dependent 
and is equal to be 12.5 mBq. m-3, on average 
 -3-
3.1 Sample preparation 
Wet and dry deposition samples were 
obtained using a large-area deposition collector 
( 1.00 m L x 1.00 m W x 0.30 m H). Fallout 
samples were collected on a monthly basis and 
were dried to reduce the sample volume. 
Subsequently, radiometric analysis was 
conducted to determine the deposition flux of 
7Be (Bq. m-2.s-1). Air samples were collected 
once a week with a glass fiber filter (47 mm in 
diameter) mounted on a high-volume air sampler 
(HD-28, RADeCO) set to a flow rate of 40 LPM. 
Filters collected on a monthly basis were 
combined and were subjected to gamma-ray 
counting to determine the 7Be concentration of 
the surface air (Bq.m-3).   
3.2 Gamma-ray counting 
Deposition and air samples were counted 
with a germanium detector (GC3520; Canberra) 
connected to a multi-channel analyzer (MCA 
35-plus; Canberra). The activity of 7Be was 
determined by following the emission of gamma 
rays at 478 keV and the spectra were analyzed 
with SAMPO 90 software. The 7Be activities 
were decay-corrected to the mid-point of sample 
collection. 
3.3 Deposition flux and velocity 
In previous studies, both the deposition 
flux and air concentration were utilized to 
determine the deposition velocity (V) of 7Be 
(Garter, 1994; Kulan et al., 2006; Young and 
Silker, 1980), as expressed by the following 
equation: 
F = C x V (1) 
where F is the deposition flux of 7Be (Bq. m-2.s-1) 
and C is 7Be concentration of the air(Bq.m-3). 
Both the deposition flux and air concentration of 
7Be were measured in the present study. 
3.4 Gross-beta counting 
Weekly air samples were measured with a 
gas-flow proportional counter (LB 5100; 
Tennelec), which had a counting efficiency of 39 
%. The gross-beta activity in air (A), in Bq/m3, 
was determined by comparing to a 40K standard 
(0.2 g KCl or an equivalent activity of 3.24 Bq). 
Gamma-ray counting revealed that, aside from 
the naturally occurring radionuclide 40K, 232Th 
and 238U, almost no other beta-emitters could be 
detected. As 7Be is not a beta-emitter, it has little 
impact on the beta counting results. Thus, the 
beta activity in air is totally attributed to the PM 
concentration, which consists primarily of the 
naturally occurring radionuclides 40K, 232Th and 
238U. 
3.5 Estimating the particulate matter (PM) 
concentrations in air 
    From 2006 to 2011, the 
corresponding PM concentrations in the 
atmosphere (g/m3) was determined by 
subtracting the filter weight before and after a 
weekly collection. The PM concentrations 
before 2006 can be determined retrospectively 
from the beta counting records.  
3.6 The activity concentration of 7Be in the 
particulate matter 
     The activity concentration of 7Be in 
the PM (Bq/g) is denoted as APM, based on the 
assumption that almost all 7Be is attached to PM 
in the atmosphere. The APM can be defined as 
 3BePM 10PM
C
(Bq/g)A    (2) 
where CBe is the atmospheric concentration of  
7Be (mBq/m3). 
3.7 Related records 
The concentrations of PM10 (particles with 
a diameter < 10 m) were obtained from the 
air-quality monitoring network of the Taiwan 
Environmental Protection Administration 
( Taiwan EPA, 2011). These concentrations were 
recorded from 1996 to 2011 at a nearby 
air-quality monitoring station located in Hsinchu 
 -5-
events usually occur in northern Taiwan during 
this time frame (Chen and Chen, 2003; Kerns et 
al., 2010). The lowest deposition flux and air 
concentration of 7Be occurred coincidently in 
July and August, when heavy rain events from 
typhoons frequently occur. 
4.4 Deposition velocity 
Most 7Be produced in the troposphere 
reaches the ground without significant decay 
because the mean removal time (10 - 35 days) of 
the troposphere is shorter than that of the 
stratosphere ( 1- 2 years ) (Shapiro and 
Forbes-Resha, 1976; Bleichrodt, 1978; 
Graustein and Turekian, 1986; Koch et al., 1996; 
Staley, 1982; Rehfeld and Heimann, 1995). 
However, the removal time of the troposphere is 
dependent on the local climatic conditions. High 
7Be deposition fluxes are frequently associated 
with high volumes of rainfall because rainfall 
events can completely remove 7Be-attached 
aerosols from the air. Additionally, rainfall 
increases the deposition velocity of aerosols in 
the washout process, which shortens the 
residence time of 7Be in the troposphere before it 
reaches the ground. Therefore, more 7Be is 
preserved prior to radioactive decay and higher 
deposition fluxes and velocities are observed. 
Monthly average data confirm that the high 
deposition velocities obtained in March were 
attributed to the spring peak [Fig. 4 (c)], and 
suggest that the observed 7Be activity of 
rainwater was greater than the expected activity. 
Alternatively, the low deposition velocities 
observed in the winter should result from higher 
7Be concentrations in surface air from high 
latitudes.     
4.5 Dry and wet deposition 
Dry deposition is defined as the direct 
transport of particles from the troposphere to the 
earth’s surface in the absence of the rainfall 
events. The dry deposition flux (Fd) can be 
expressed as 
Fd = Cd x Vd (3) 
and 
Cd = C (1- f) (4) 
where Cd is the 7Be concentration of air in the 
absence of rainfall, Vd is the dry deposition 
velocity and f is the duration of rainfall. 
Therefore, the dry to total deposition ratio (R) 
can be estimated as 
R = Fd/F = Vd (1-f)/ Vm  (5) 
where Vm is the mean deposition flux and was 
calculated as 8.6 x 10-3 m.s-1. The deposition 
velocity was positively correlated with the 
volume of rainfall, and the deposition velocity 
(V) under totally dry condition was extrapolated 
as 7.1 x 10-4 m.s-1 at 1 mm of precipitation (Fig. 
5), which is the minimum amount for rainfall 
that can be recorded. The seasonal variation of 
the dry to total deposition ratio (R) was 
calculated according to Eq. (4), and the results 
are shown in Fig 6. As shown in the figure, the 
dry to total deposition ratio varied seasonally 
from 3.77 to 22.6 %. Specifically, the value of R 
is higher in the winter than in other seasons and 
was equal to 9.86 %, on average, which is 
comparable to the values reported in the 
literature (Ioannidou and Papastefanou, 2006; 
Rosner et al., 1996; Simon et al., 2009; Todd, 
1989). 
4.6 7Be in rain waters                              
To determine the deposition flux due to 
wet processes (Fw), the volume of precipitation 
(P) should be considered: 
Fw = F - Fd = P x Crw (6) 
where Crw is the 7Be concentration of rainwater 
(Bq. m-3).  
Two heavy rainfall seasons occur in 
Taiwan. Namely, the mei-yu occurs in May and 
June, and precipitation due to tropical cyclones 
occurs primarily in August and September (Chen
