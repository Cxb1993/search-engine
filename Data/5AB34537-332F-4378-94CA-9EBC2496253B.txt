一、Abstract  
The gasification of two different 
high-volatile pulverized coals in a drop tube 
furnace is investigated experimentally to 
simulate coal reactions in entrained-bed 
gasifiers and in blast furnaces. A simplified 
model is also developed to predict the 
performance of coal gasification. The model 
is conducted based on the mass conservation 
of inert gas N2. The analyses suggest that, 
despite the proximate analyses of the two 
coals being similar, the carbon conversion 
ratio (CCR) depends intrinsically on the 
nature of coal. It is also found that a higher 
CCR may result from a richer carbon dioxide 
generated, whereby the concentration of 
syngas does not increase accordingly. The 
developed model has provided a simple and 
reliable method to aid analyzing the 
reactivity of coal employed in industrial 
furnaces.

二、Introduction 
Coal is an important fuel or raw 
material in industries. For example, in a 
coal-fired power plant, coal is burned in 
boilers to heat water. The produced 
high-temperature and high-pressure steam is 
used to drive turbines followed by generators 
so as to generate electricity [1]. In an 
ironmaking process, coal is an essential raw 
material in that the coal will be pulverized 
and injected into blast furnaces as an 
auxiliary fuel [2]. In a gasifier, coal is 
controlled in the situation of partial oxidation, 
thereby converting the hydrocarbon fuel into 
a gaseous product such as synthesis gas [3]. 
Within these applications of coal, coal 
gasification has received a great deal of 
attention since the integrated gasification 
combined cycle (IGCC) was developed 
successful [4].

Figure 2 first displays the concentration 
distributions of H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 at 
various reaction temperatures. For Coal A, 
Fig. 2a depicts that, when the reaction 
temperature is in the range of 1100  an℃ d 
1300 , the concentrations of H℃ 2 are almost 
imperceptible and the concentrations of CO 
are very low. In contrast, the concentrations 
of CO2 are much higher than that of CO. This 
reveals that a lower reaction temperature is 
conducive to the combustion reaction so that 
the formation of CO2 is relatively significant. 
Only when the reaction temperature is as 
high as 1400 , the gasification of Coal A ℃
becomes pronounced in that the 
concentrations of H2 and CO grow 
substantially, whereas the concentration of 
CO2 decays rapidly. With regard to CH4, its 
formation is extremely sensitive to the 
reaction temperature because the 
concentration decreases markedly with 
increasing temperature; CH4 even disappears 
when the temperature reaches 1500 . ℃
Subsequently, the concentration distributions 
of the produced gases from Coal B 
gasification are demonstrated in Fig. 2b. 
Similar to the behavior of Coal A, H2 is very 
rare when the reaction temperature is 
relatively low; however, the formation of H2 
is excited at 1300 . A compari℃ son between 
Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b indicates that, under the 
condition of the same reaction temperatures, 
the concentration distributions of the above 
four gases are pretty different, though the 
proximate analysis of Coal A is close to that 
of Coal B. It is recognized that the 
gasification characteristics are mainly 
determined by coal nature but not by 
proximate analysis.

From the developed model, the 
performance of coal gasification can be 
predicted directly via the concentrations of 
the four gases. Based on the model, Fig. 3 
further sketches the profiles of the CCR of 
the two coals at various reaction 
temperatures. It can be seen that the CCR of 
Coal A ranges from 0.6 to 0.95, whereas the 
CCR of Coal B is in the range of 0.04 and 
0.75. In view of the values of Coal A being 
greatly higher than that of Coal B, it reflects 
that the reactivity of Coal A is better than 
that of Coal B. In Fig. 4, it is also noted that 
the CCR of Coal A is relatively insensitive to 
the increase of the reaction temperature. 
Regarding Coal B, however, as long as the 
reaction temperature is higher to a certain
