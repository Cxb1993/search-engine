Abstract
This research proposed that the viewing conditions for printed matters and projected images
are quite different for three major reasons. Therefore, the brightness perception phenomenon
and brightness perception theory generated from the printed matters should be revised and
modified when applied to the projected images. The purposes of the present research were to
examine the effects of brightness illusions while viewing the projected images, to understand the
brightness perception process in projection environment, and thus to generate design implications
for better usage of the projectors.

1. Introduction
One of the well-known brightness illusions is the simultaneous contrast effect. As shown
in Fig. 1, the two central medium-gray squares are the same shade of gray, but look different
because they are against different backgrounds. A square on a dark background looks brighter,
and one on a light background looks darker. Previous researchers have proposed some
explanations for this effect such as the lateral inhibition in the retina [4, 7], cognitive approaches
[2, 6, 10], Gestalt approaches [3, 5, 8, 9], etc. Along with the remarkable progress and
application of display projecting industry during recent years, more basic and applied research
related to projecting efficiency and brightness perception are needed. However, most of the past
studies regarding brightness perception are based on the research results from printed matters and
cannot generalize to projected images.
The viewing conditions for printed matters and projected images are quite different for
several reasons. First, people usually read printed matters at high level of illumination and the
photopic vision (>3.4cd/m2) is used in this situation. Cones on the retina are activated. On the
other hand, dim illumination is applied to the usage of a projector and the mesopic vision
(0.034cd/m2~3.4cd/m2) is used in this case. Both cones and rods are functioning when visual
process takes place in dim lights.
background areas (10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 cd/m2), and five luminance levels of the center areas (20,
40, 60, 80 and 100 cd/m2). Because the adjusted area was on a dark surrounding, people may
perceive this area brighter than it really was according to the simultaneous contrast effect. In
other words, in order to have the same brightness perception, people do not need to adjust
luminance as bright as the compared square (center area). Therefore, under estimation of
brightness may occur.
2.3 Procedures
Each subject experienced 50 experimental trials (2×5×5) in two stages; one for printed
matters and the other for projected images. Within each stage, random sequences were used to
counterbalance the possible fatigue or learning effects. When subjects completed one
experimental trial, they might go to next randomly assigned trial until all trials were done.
At the stage of viewing projected images, the standard settings of projecting environment
suggested by ANSI were applied [1]. Fig.2 is one sample tested screen programmed by Visual
Basic before the experiment. Subjects used a scroll bar to adjust the luminance values of the
experimental square (adjusted area in Fig. 2) until they perceive the experimental square having
the same brightness level as the compared central square (center area in Fig. 2).
While looking at the printed matters, subjects examined several squares of different degrees
of gray levels with a dark surrounding and chose one printout close to the brightness level of the
compared center area.

3. Results and Discussions
Three-way ANOVAs with repeated measures were conducted to analyze the effects of two
different viewing conditions and various luminance levels of center and background areas on
brightness illusion. The ANOVA summary table and average values are provided in Table 1
and 2, respectively. Three-way interaction was statistically significant and the other effects
(including two-way interactions and main effects) were also significant. It means that
simultaneous contrast effects were influenced by viewing conditions, background and center
luminance.
The average illusion values under two viewing conditions were depicted on Fig. 3 and 4.
