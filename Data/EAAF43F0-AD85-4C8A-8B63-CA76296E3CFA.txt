Abstract 
The soil-to-plant transfer of essential and 
trace elements in plants can be described by 
concentration ratio (CR) to understand the 
metabolism of mineral nutrition and plant uptake 
associated with biogeochemistry of the 
surroundings. Concentrations and distribution of 
radium and its chemical analogues in different 
soil extracted solutions, obtained by microwave 
extraction were determined to estimate the 
contribution to plant uptake from the various 
extracted solutions in soils. The extracted 
fractions in soils are based on different 
extraction methods, which were used to express 
the bioavailability of plants and explain the 
uptake mechanism and accumulation of radium 
and its chemical analogues. The extraction 
fraction follows the order: EDTA > CaCl2 > 
CH3COOH. The available fractions, in terms of 
CH3COOH extracted soil concentrations, of 
radium and its chemical analogues are 
proportional to their whole concentrations in 
soils. Both the CRs of radium and its chemical 
analogues increase 30-40 times if using available 
soil fraction instead of whole soil content.  
Keywords: radium; concentration ratio;

2. Introduction 
Naturally occurring radionuclides, such as 
thorium, uranium and radium can be taked up by 
plants. Some ferns have been identified as 
hyper-accumulation plants since they 
simultaneously accumulate of barium (Ba), rare 
earth elements (REEs) and radium ( Kabashi and 
Tominaga, 1985; Koyama et al., 1987; Wang et 
al., 1997; Shan et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2005). 
The fern Dicranoptesis linearis has been 
recognized to concentrate radium tens to 
hundreds of times higher than ordinary plants 
grown in the normal radiation background (Chao 
et al, 2006; Chao et al., 2007). D. linearis has 
been identified as a hyper-accumulation plant for 
radium and its chemical analogues based on the 
definition: concentration ratio (CR) of shoot to 
root must exceed 1 (McGrath and Zhao, 2003; 
Zu et al., 2005). The chemical analogues of 
radium include alkaline earth metal Ba and 15 
rare earth elements (Chao and Chuang, 2011).  
A number of extraction methods have been 
suggested for evaluation of metal concentrations 
in soils, they can be classified into separate 
groups as: acids, chelating agents, buffered and 
unbuffered salt solutions. Neutral salt, such as 
CaCl2 (0.01 M). has been accepted as the best 
for simulating an element concentrations in 
exchangeable fractions and widely proposed to 
assess metal bioavailability (Kabata-Pendias, 
2004). Additionally, the water fraction in soils, 
extracted by CH3COOH, can be a suitable 
measure of the amount of metals in soil pore 
water which are easily available to the plants. 
Chelating agents, such as EDTA and DTPA 
(Wang et al., 2004; Kabata-Pendias, 2004; Ure, 
1996), representing the available fraction for 
plants in soil solution. 
Instead of conventional methods using 
sequential extractions (Tessier et al., 1979). 
Single microwave extraction has been employed 
to evaluate the possible mobility and 
bioavailability of heavy metals presented in soils, 
demonstrating satisfactory correlation between 
 -3-
(Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 2001).  
4.2 Concentration of the chemical analogues in 
extracted soil solutions  
The bioavailable concentrations of radium 
and these elements in soils were determined 
based on the soil fractions extracted by EDTA, 
CaCl2 and CH3COOH, respectively (Table 3-5). 
The mean values of the soil extracted 
concentrations, represented as soil (whole), soil 
(EDTA), soil (CaCl2), and soil (CH3COOH) are 
summarized in Table 6. As a whole, The 
extraction fractions by the extractants follows 
the order: EDTA (f1＝23.7%), CaCl2 (f2＝7.5%), 
CH3COOH(f3＝3.3%); this tendency is 
consistent with the reported data (Lu et al., 
2003). On the contrary, the soil-to-plant 
concentration ratio(CR) increase with this order. 
The soil solution extracted by CH3COOH 
represent the pore water in soils at pH=5, is 
similar to the field condition in the sampling site. 
In this condition, the available fractions for these 
chemical analogues can be calculated and 
described in Fig. 1, in which radium ( 226Ra and 
228Ra) have comparable available fractions ( 1 – 
5 %) to the REEs except for Y, its available 
fraction is 7%, the highest value among them. In 
other words, the plant available contents for 
these chemical analogues, except for Y, are 
proportional to their whole concentrations in 
soils. 
4.3 Concentration ratios (CR) derived based on 
various soil fractions 
The CR values were derived for the 
chemical analogues using various soil fractions 
extracted in this experiment and listed in Table 7. 
For Ba and REEs extracted by CH3COOH , the 
CR3 is estimated to be 60-70 times higher than 
that of CR (whole soil) , while it is 140 times 
higher than the CR for radium ( 226Ra and 228Ra). 
This high CR3 value proved that radium and 
these elements can be accumulated together by 
the fern. However, both REEs and radium 
( 226Ra and 228Ra) have almost the same ratio of 
CR3/CR, which were estimated between 30 – 40. 
Besides, the CR1/CR were between 3 - 5, and 
CR2/CR were between 10 – 12(Fig.2).  
4.4 228Ra/226Ra ratio in D. linearis 
It is noted that the CR3(228Ra)/CR3(226Ra) is 
1.250 in CH3COOH extracted solution and the 
CR(228Ra)/CR(226Ra) is 1.057 in the whole soil 
(Table 7). The half-life of 228Ra is 5.75 years, 
being relatively short in comparison to that of 
226Ra (t1/2= 1600 y). 
Concentration of 228Ra in pore water of 
soil should accumulate more rapidly with time 
than that of 226Ra, because 226Ra behaves like a 
stable chemical analogues and their 
concentrations are relatively steady. As a result, 
228Ra/226Ra ratio is usually larger than unity in 
soil solution and then in shoots.  
5. Conclusions 
In this study, the accumulation of radium 
with respect to its chemical analogues by D. 
linearis was investigated in an uncontaminated 
environment. Concentrations of radium and the 
chemical analogues, including alkaline earth 
metals (Sr and Ba) and REEs in different soil 
solutions were determined. Three common 
adapted extraction methods using EDTA, CaCl2 
and CH3COOH as extractants were compared 
for evaluating phyto-availability of the plant. 
Except for Y, the available fractions, based on 
the CH3COOH extracted concentrations, of 
radium and its chemical analogues account for 
1 – 5 % of whole soil concentration. Besides, the 
available fractions of these elements are 
proportional to the whole concentrations in soils. 
The phyto-availability of D. linearis were 
expressed by concentration ratios (CRs) derived 
using the three soil extracted solutions. The CR 
for whole soil is 3.8 for radium, while it 
increased to 160 for CH3COOH extracted soil 
fraction. This increment is about the same as 
those for its chemical analogues: Ba and REEs.
