1. Introduction 
The motivation of this research is 
to prove by experiments that 
precondensation effect under the 
influence of Ti4+ impurity is significant 
for the dissolution and reprecipitation of 
γ-Al2O3 nanocondenstaes upon 
excitation to form specific faces with 
periordic bond chains (PBCs) [1] at the 
expense of the dense {111} surfaces 
originally formed via a dynamic pulsed 
laser ablation (PLA) process for a rapid 
heating-cooling and hence a pressure 
effect. 
 
Corundum, α-Al2O3, is the 
thermodynamically stable phase of 
coarsely crystalline aluminum oxide at 
standard temperature and pressure 
conditions, but syntheses of 
nanocrystalline Al2O3 usually result in 
γ-Al2O3 [2].  The fine-sized γ-Al2O3 
particles have been widely used as soft 
abrasive and catalytic materials.  A 
number of methods, such as sintering by 
microwave [3], plasma activated process 
[4] and hot press [5], have been 
employed to produce almost completely 
sintered γ-Al2O3 polycrystals without 
excessive grain growth for engineering 
applications as a bulk. 
 
PLA has been used to fabricate 
γ-Al2O3 condensates with an internal 
compressive stress up to several GPa 
and an unexpected large (micrometer) 
size [6].  The internal compressive 
stress and the well-developed {111}/ 
{100} surfaces of the condensates were 
suggested to suppress their 
transformation into the stable α-Al2O3 
form [6].  The Cr3+-doped γ-Al2O3 and 
α-Al2O3 condensates with the same level 
of internal compressive stress, as 
indicated by photoluminescence R lines, 
were further synthesized by PLA on the 
clamped Cr and Al target [7].  PLA 
techniques have been used also to 
largely widen the solid solubility of 
otherwise almost immiscible end 
members, such as the NiO-TiO2 binary 
[8].  The α-Al2O3-TiO2 binary has also 
negligible solid solubility for the end 
members and the compound Al2TiO5 
under ambient pressure condition [9].  
It is not clear if the γ-Al2O3 has a wider 
solid solubility of Ti4+ under 
nonequilibrium condition via a dynamic 
process. 
 
Here, PLA process was employed 
to fabricate Ti4+-doped γ-Al2O3 
condensates focusing on the effect of 
widened solid solubility of Ti4+, via 
such a dynamic heating/cooling process, 
on the shape, phase and {hkl}-specific 
coalescence defects of the condensates.  
The development of etching pits and 
surface corrugation in terms of 
{hkl}-specific facets with high PBCs as 
well as the polygonization-rejuvenation 
process of the condensates upon

3.2. upon electron irradiation 
The Ti-doped γ-Al2O3 nanocrystals 
showed additional {100} and {110} 
facets with 2 and 1 PBCs in terms of 
edge-shared octahedra, respectively 
when subjected to electron irradiation 
(Figs. 6-9). 
. 
3.3. Vibrational and optical properties 
The substitution of Ti4+ for Al3+ in 
the tetrahedral and/or octahedral sites of 
the spinel type structure for a lower band 
gap of 3.4 eV was manifested by 
UV-visible absorption of the γ-Al2O3 
condensates (Fig. 10). 
 
4. Discussion 
4.1. Shape of the Ti4+-doped γ-Al2O3 
condensates 
Precondensation during 
solifidication or crystallization from 
melt/solutions may affect the attachment 
of ions/atoms on specific F faces in 
terms of PBCs and hence favor 
surprising faces not following the PBC 
predictions [1].  In the present case of 
condensation from vapor, this 
precondensation effect may not be 
effective even in the presence of tramp 
Ti impurities.  As a consequence, the 
as condensated γ-Al2O3:Ti4+ 
nanoparticles are not much different in 
shape in comparison with the undoped 
case [6].  The precondensation effect 
and Kirkendall effect are however 
effective in the subsequent electron 
irradiation process to form nano cavities 
and pits.  We may mention PBCs, 
anisotropic partition distribution, and 
solute trapping effect here.  Note the 
{001}, {110} and {111} plane have 2, 1 
and 0 PBCs, i.e. F, S and K faces, 
respectively in terms of the edge-shared 
octahedral for the fcc-type γ-Al2O3.  
Thus, the {111} has the least PBC 
despite the highest surface density 
among the three surfaces for γ-Al2O3. 
 
4.2. Solute expulsion of the γ-Al2O3 
condensates upon electron irradiation 
Electron beam is expected to cause 
expulsion of Ti from the γ-Al2O3 lattice 
and hence shape change and 
amorphization.  Such a diffusion 
induced or decomposition induced 
amorphous phase should not be 
mistaken as that due to condensation by 
a PLA process [10]. 
 
Having a cubic spinel-like 
structure, i.e. a 2x2x2 superstructure of 
the rock-salt type, the Ti4+-doped 
γ-Al2O3 would allow solute expulsion in 
a rather isotropic manner except near the 
dislocations acting as short-circuit 
diffusion path.  For example, thermal 
exposure of Co1-xO-MgO solid solution 
with a rock salt-type structure at 1500oC 
was known to cause anisotropic 
development of {111}/{100} faceted 
etch pits/hillocks due to predominant 
exposure of 〈110〉oriented dislocation 
on the {111} surfaces [11].  The 
Ti-doped γ-Al2O3 with a spinel 
superstructure of the rock salt-type is
