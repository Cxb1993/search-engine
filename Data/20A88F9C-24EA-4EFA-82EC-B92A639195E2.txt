Abstract 
An integrated approach is applied for analyzing the interaction between two parallel 
surfaces grafted with the interpenetration polymer brushes in a good solvent. In the 
proposed approach, MD simulations are performed to establish the mean brush height and 
the standard deviation of the brush height distribution for a given value of the surface 
separation. The corresponding probability density function (PDF) of the brush height is 
then determined, and a statistical technique is applied to compute the corresponding 
interaction free energy per unit area of the grafted substrates. Finally, the Derjaguin 
approximation is employed to determine the corresponding value of the interaction force 
between the two surfaces. The results obtained by the current method for the interaction 
force are found to be in better agreement with the experimental data than those obtained 
using the AdG or MWC models. The enhanced performance of the proposed method is 
attributed primarily to the use of an adaptive non-Gaussian PDF of the brush height to 
model the effects of brush interpenetration and fluctuations in the brush conformation at 
different distances from the grafting plane.

1.1 Introduction 
Polymer brushes are of practical 
importance in a wide variety of applications, 
including colloid stabilization, adhesion, 
lubrication, tribology, rheology, and so forth. 
Due to their potential for a wide range of 
existing and emerging applications, polymer 
brushes have attracted intense research 
activity in recent decades. Utilizing scaling 
theory, and assuming a constant monomer 
density throughout the brush, Alexander and 
de Gennes [1,2] determined the interaction 
force between two parallel surfaces with 
grafted polymer layers, i.e. AdG model. 
However, in practice, the assumption of a 
uniform monomer density is valid only for 
very dense brushes, in which the chains are 
extended to almost their full extent. Milner 
et al. [3] calculated the interaction force of a 
compressed brush using a 
self-consistent-field (SCF) model and 
suggested that the monomer density profile 
decreased parabolically from a finite value 
at the grafting plane to zero at the edge of 
the brush rather than a step-like profile as 
suggested in [1,2], i.e. MWC model. 
 
1.2 Research Purpose 
To analyze the effect of 
interpenetration to the interaction between 
two parallel surfaces grafted with identical 
polymer brushes in a good solvent, the 
current study presents a hybrid approach 
comprising MD simulations and a statistical 
technique. The proposed method resolves 
the limitations of pure MD simulation 
schemes and provides a convenient and 
accurate means of establishing the 
interaction free energy and interaction force 
per unit area between the two parallel 
substrates. 
 
1.3 Review of Research 
The interpenetration of brushes is 
ignored in both the AdG and the MWC 
models, as it was expected to disappear for 
infinitely long chains [2,4]. Chakrabarti et al. 
[5] performed Monte Carlo simulations of a 
brush-brush system and showed that at a 
certain value of the surface separation, the 
polymer brushes grafted on the opposing 
plates interfered with one another, resulting 
in either a compression effect or an 
interpenetration effect, or some combination 
of the two. Whitmore and Noolandi [6] 
utilized mean-field SCF theory to 
investigate the characteristics of a 
brush-brush system and showed that an 
interpenetration effect was evident at all 
values of the surface separation for which a

2. Theoretical models 
2.1. Compression of Polymer Brushes 
with Interpenetration Assumption 
This section considers the case where the 
compression of the polymer brushes is 
accompanied by an interpenetration effect, 
i.e. the brushes on the opposing substrates 
become interdigitated as the substrates are 
brought into contact with one another (see 
Fig. 1). According to the theoretical analysis 
proposed by Witten et al. [4], and 
subsequently confirmed via numerical SCF 
calculations [11], the interpenetration depth, 
ξ , varies as a function of the surface 
separation in accordance with 1/3hξ −∼ . 
Therefore, the dimensionless 
interpenetration depth, 0/ hξ , can be 
expressed as 
1/3
00/ h hξ ξ ξ −= = ,                  (1) 
where 0ξ  represents the dimensionless 
initial interpenetration depth corresponding 
to 0h h=  and h  is the dimensionless 
separation, 0/h h . Applying the brush height 
PDF, ( )p z , the interaction force per unit 
area ( nf ) between the grafting surface and a 
virtual surface separated by a distance h  
and subject to an interpenetration of the 
respective brush layers is given by

substrate for a single polymer brush [12].

where Γ  is the Gamma function.  
From the discussions above, it is clear 
that computing the PDF of the brush height 
at any given value of the normalized surface 
separation, h , requires a prior knowledge of 
the values of the skewness ( Sk ) and kurtosis 
( Kt ) parameters of the brush height 
distribution. In the present study, these 
parameter values are derived using an 
iterative numerical method, as described in 
the following section. 
2.3. Numerical Scheme 
In the PDF formulation given in Eq. (6), 
the upper bound of z , i.e. ( 2 mB h+ ), is 
equal to ( h ξ+ ) when the normalized 
surface separation between the two parallel 
surfaces is h  (see Fig. 1). Prior to 
compression, an initial value of the 
normalized interpenetration depth ( )0 iξ  is 
specified. Subsequently (i.e. after a surface 
compression effect is applied), the 
normalized interpenetration depth, ξ , is 
determined from Eq. (1), and the left-hand 
side of Eq. (8) is given 
by 1 2 cB B h Lξ+ = + − . (Note that the value 
of h ξ+  never exceeds 2h  due to the 
geometric restriction imposed by the upper 
plate.) Using the same procedure as that 
described in [12], the true values of Sk  and 
Kt  are obtained for a given surface 
separation h  such that the corresponding 
value of the brush height PDF can be 
determined. 
Having determined the PDF, the value of 
( )p z  is substituted into Eq. (5) to obtain 
the normalized free energy nW  
corresponding to the current value of the 
surface separation h . The results of Eq (5) 
then used at this stage of the solution 
procedure to compute the interaction force 
using Eq (4). Having computed ( )n
h
W , the 
solution procedure incrementally reduces the 
value assigned to the surface separation, 
re-evaluates the corresponding value of the 
interpenetration depth (if appropriate) and 
uses Eqs. (9) and (10) to re-compute the 
values of the normalized mean brush 
 7
the separation distance h  is reduced. 
However, as the surface separation is further 
reduced, it can be seen that σ  exhibits a 
transitional-type behavior in response to 
changes in the surface separation. Finally, it 
is observed that σ  decreases linearly with 
a slope of 0.4 as the separation distance h  
approaches cL . 
Figure 4 illustrates the results obtained 
using the current numerical method for the 
brush height PDF at three specific values of 
the surface separation. Note that in 
computing these results, the equilibrium 
brush height 0h , the initial penetration depth 
0ξ , and the fully-compressed brush height 
cL  are specified as 10 nm, 2 nm and 1 nm, 
respectively. As shown, in plotting the 
results, the distance from the grafting 
plane, z , is normalized by the equilibrium 
height of the brush layer, 0h . In the 
equilibrium position, i.e. 0/ 1.0h h = , the 
PDF function (Profile 1 in Fig. 4) is 
symmetrical with respect to an imaginary 
surface positioned midway between the 
surface of cz L=  and the upper bound of 
the distribution range (i.e. 0 0h ξ+ ). When a 
small compression is applied 
(e.g. 0/ 0.8h h = ), the PDF (Profile 2) is 
skewed slightly towards the compressing 
surface. In other words, the correlation 
between the normalized mean height and the 
surface separation shifts toward that 
associated with the upper bound solution 
(line 1 in Fig. 2). At a slightly greater 
compression of 0/ 0.7h h = , both ( )p z  
profiles have a greater degree of skewness, 
and thus it can be inferred that more of the 
brushes are interdigitated with one another. 
The interpenetration effect can be 
further evaluated by introducing the 
following penetration fraction parameter:  
( ) ( )hhh p z d zξγ +≡ ∫ .                (14) 
Figure 5 illustrates the variation of the 
penetration fraction with the surface 
separation as a function of the initial 
interpenetration depth 0ξ . In the present 
analysis, the compression effect validates 
only when the value of the surface 
separation slight larger than the mean value 
of the brush height and thus a maximum 
compression value of 0/ 0.5h h =  is set. As 
predicted by Eq. (1), it can be seen that the 
penetration fraction increases with a 
reducing surface separation. Furthermore, it 
is observed that for a given value of the 
surface separation, the penetration fraction 
increases with an increasing value of the 
initial interpenetration depth 0ξ . 
To confirm the validity of the proposed 
method, the results obtained for the 
interaction force were compared with the 
experimental force-distance profiles 
presented in the literature for two PS-X 
(X:-N+(CH3)2(CH2)3SO3-) polymer 
sequences grafted on mica surfaces in a 
toluene solvent [15,16]. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) 
compare the present results with the 
experimental data obtained for PS-X 
sequences with wM =65kDa [16] and 
wM =141kDa [15], respectively. Note that 
the equivalent results computed using the 
AdG and MWC models are also presented 
for comparison purposes. In computing the 
present results, the values assigned to the 
fully-compressed brush height cL  which 
corresponding to the minimum separation 
available in the experimental data and the 
initial penetration depth 0ξ  derived 
 9
statistical scheme proposed in this study 
yields more accurate results for the 
interaction force than either the AdG model 
or the MWC model due to its consideration 
of the brush interpenetration effect and the 
use of an adaptive brush height PDF to 
capture the subtle variations in the brush 
conformation at different distances from the 
grafting plane. Moreover, the present 
method enables the material parameter 
required to compute the interaction force 
generated by each polymer brush to be 
directly derived with a high degree of 
precision and reproducibility. Thus, the 
proposed method provides a significant 
advantage over pure MD simulation 
schemes in which the scaling parameters 
required to compare the numerical results 
with the experimental data must be assigned 
without any theoretical basis.

sequences.
