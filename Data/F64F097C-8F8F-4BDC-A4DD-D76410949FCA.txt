degrading persistent xenobiotic compounds through acclimation (Singleton, 1994; Buitron 
and Gonzalez, 1996; Mangat and Elefsiniotis, 1999). The required acclimation process 
indicates that microbial members of the activated sludge are to acquire certain degradation 
capability to become degraders (Chong, 2005). 
The rise of degradation capability of microorganisms for xenobiotic compounds had 
been explained in many ways (for example, Wiggings and Alexander, 1987), including gene 
transfer. Recent findings suggest that horizontal gene exchange plays an important role with 
which xenobiotic degradation ability is considered essential to the evolution of 
microorganisms (Davison, 1999). Bacteria that can metabolize organic xenobiotics were 
found to express novel catabolic pathways arising from genes gained from external mobile 
genetic elements (MGEs) (Springael and Top, 2004). Plasmids are the major carriers cited 
to transfer genes that subsequently disseminate foreign genes into a receiving microbial 
population (van der Meer et al., 1992; van der Meer, 1994; Tsuda et al., 1999). 
For particular xenobiotic degradation, a 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) 
catabolic, self-transmissible plasmid (pKA2) was found to transfer horizontally from one 
pure culture strain to another in laboratory liquid medium (Ka and Tiedje, 1994), while 
another (pJP4) was shown to transfer from a carrier species to indigenous soil recipients 
which then increased their 2, 4-D degradation rates (DiGiovanni et al., 1996). Among 
activated sludge, mobile elements which code chlorocatechol degradation had been 
demonstrated to transfer to populations in suspended and attached growth modes, and as a 
result increased degradation rate of the target chlorobenzoate was found (Top et al., 2002). 
Mobilization of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) to indigenous populations 
in a fully functional activated sludge reactor was observed (McClure et al., 1989; 1990).  
Although evidence of horizontal MGE transfer was found for activated sludge, results 
for the enhancement of degradation performance in real treatment systems in which a MGE 
transfer has occurred have been either inconsistent or dubious (Goldstein et al., 1985;

Experimental reactions included 1) cultivation of raw (un-acclimated) activated sludge; 
2) acclimation of raw activated sludge to 2, 4-D; 3) degradation of 2, 4-D with acclimated 
activated sludge; and 4) degradation of 2, 4-D with the mixture of acclimated and raw 
activated sludge.  
Activated sludge cultivation was conducted with a fed-batch reactor, which was fed 
once daily with 120 mg/l of sucrose and 30 mg/l peptone, and minerals listed above. The 
initial microbial inoculates were obtained from an undeveloped forest soil that had no 
record of 2, 4-D nor metal (slag) contaminations. This mixed culture’s origin and 
experience rendered this biomass a good indigenous nature. The mixed culture from soil 
was grown to a suitable amount on Nutrient Broth (NB) for a number of subcultures before 
it was used to seed the fed-batch reactor for cultivation of the activated sludge populations 
needed for 2, 4-D acclimation and degradation.  
All acclimation and degradation reactions were conducted using shake-flask batch 
reactors. The culture media contained 2, 4-D as the sole carbon source and minerals listed 
above. The shake-flasks were 250 ml conical flasks with media filled to 100 ml; the 
medium was aerated by rotary shaking at 120 rpm. All reactors were placed in a 
temperature-controlled room at 25±2 °C. 
2.2 Measurement 
Measurement of 2, 4-D of all reactions was performed using UV absorbance of the 
reactor content after filtration (through Millipore Millex GS, pore size 0.22 μm). UV 
absorbance at 235 nm was compared to a calibration to obtain the 2, 4-D concentrations of 
a sample. Amount of sludge was measured as Suspended Solids (SS); activated sludge 
suspensions from cultivation and acclimation reactors were filtered and the filterable 
portions (on Whatman GF/C, pore size 1.2 μm) weighed after drying (Section 2540D, 
Standard Method 20th Edition: Total suspended solids dried at 103-105oC).

Cells transformed into degraders by receiving a transfer (designated as Xt) were 
considered to carry the same degradation characteristics as the original the donor. Thus, in a 
batch mode degradation reaction coupled with transfer, degraders Xd, the amount of which 
was considered a fraction of Xy, increased from growth on their substrate and also from 
conversion of non-degraders. The overall rate of Xd increases was written as: 
( ) tddgd rXkrdtdX +−=  (1) 
where Xd  = concentration of degrader = a.Xy , (mg-SS/l)

Considering both XD and Xt carried the same degradation characteristics, their growth

substrate depletion was written as:

describing MGE (or plasmid) transfer rates between a donor and a recipient (Levin and

An experimental (S-Sn) data set was fitted a curve using the curve-fitting tool of Excel 
(Microsoft Office 2003). An apparent transfer rate rap was determined from the second 
derivative with respect to time of the (S-Sn) time curve. All rap resulting from the Xy and Xn 
combinations were plotted versus the respective XyXn and the function f4 was determined 
judging from functional shape of the curve formed.  
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Degradation enhanced by transfer 
When an acclimated activated sludge Xy, which contained degraders and thus capable 
to certain level, and an un-acclimated activated sludge Xn were placed together in reaction 
with 2, 4-D, the mixed populations degraded 2, 4-D at rates higher than those resulted from 
Xy reacting alone. These results are shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. Since Xn alone was unable 
to degrade (Figs. 1, 2a, and 3a), and absorption was insignificant (tests were specially 
performed to rule out this concern; data not shown), the added performance was considered 
an evidence that degradation capability was horizontally transferred from capable activated 
sludge to those incapable initially. The differences (increases) in 2, 4-D degradation rates 
were due to additional amount of degraders formed from non-degraders which had received 
a transfer in the degrader and non-degrader mixture populations.

The apparent transfer rate rap for each mixture of Xy and Xn was determined from the 
second derivatives with respect to time of the mixture’s ( )nSS − quadratic function shown 
in Figs. 4 and 5. A plot of rap versus Xy Xn is shown in Fig. 6a. From Fig. 6a the possible 
functional form for f4 (Eq. (12)) was examined. When Xn was constant (at 145 mg/l), a 
linear fit of rap versus XyXn was found (R2 = 0.97). However, when Xn was at lower 
concentrations, the linear fit was no longer exact with respect to XyXn. Instead, at constant 
Xy while Xn were low showed a curvilinear fit of rap with respect to Xn (Fig. 6b). A 
rectangular hyperbolic function was considered reasonable in representing this curve of rap 
with respect to Xn.  
Steps in the conversion of Xn to Xy start from the donation to reception and finally 
forming the products. The reaction steps should proceed as: 
pcno XEXXE
kk ⎯→⎯⎯→⎯+ 21 (product) (13) 
where [Eo] = [ED]-[EX c] the strength of the portion of donor element that is free to give to 
Xn at time t; ED the density (strength) of total available elements from the donors. Xp is to 
transform into new Xy with a rate which is not limiting to the whole transfer process, and 
EXc (EXcomplex) reversal to donor is considered minimal.  
 The rate of transfer was the rate at which the product Xt was formed, which was 
kinetically equivalent to the forming of Xp. On the donating side, ED is proportional to 
concentration Xy, therefore the transfer rate is proportional to Xy. On the receiving side, only 
the initial involvement of donating element with receiving Xn sees the strength Xn. 
Derivation of the rate function that described Xp formation going through the steps in Eq. 
(13) was similar to the enzyme-substrate-product reaction presented as the 
Michaelis-Menten or the Monod equations (Briggs and Haldane, 1925; Haldane, 1930; 
Monod, 1949). The result obtained was:

concentration on the rate of capability transfer, if any. Whether the presence of the 
xenobiotic is a prerequisite for transfer to occur, or transfer can proceed at a threshold 
xenobiotic concentration, are topics requiring further investigations. 
4. Conclusions 
Conclusions drawn from this study include: 
1. Compared with the capable sludge reacting alone, increased xenobiotic degradation 
rates were found when the capable activated sludge was mixed with raw (incapable) 
sludge. The increase in degradation rate was attributed to degradation capability being 
horizontally transferred from the capable sludge to the raw sludge making some raw 
sludge capable. 
2. The rectangular hyperbolic function of recipient was f und suitable for describing 
horizontal transfer rate of 2, 4-D degrading capability among activated sludge.  
3. The model for horizontal transfer kinetics of xenobiotic degradation capability is to be 
coupled with the growth model in describing degradation of a xenobiotic by activated 
sludge which contains degraders and non-degraders.

Evolutions of microbial degradation pathways for parent xenobiotic and for 
its metabolites follow different schemes 
 
Nyuk-Min Chong. Chun-Shuo Chang. Shiu-Ching Tsai 
 
Abstract  
Background and purposes The pathways used by microorganisms for the metabolism of 
every xenobiotic substrate are specific. The catabolism of a xenobiotic goes through a series 
of intermediate steps and lower intermediates (metabolites) appear in sequence. The structure 
of the metabolites can be similar to the parent’s due to kinship. The purposes of this study 
were to examine if the degradation pathways that were developed for a parent xenobiotic are 
effective to degrade the parent’s lower metabolites, and if the reverse is true. 
Materials and methods The xenobiotic substrates, 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D, the 
parent xenobiotic) and its metabolite 2, 4-dichlorophenol (2, 4-DCP) were subjected 
independently to acclimation and degradation tests by the biomasses of mixed-culture 
activated sludge and a pure-culture of Arthrobacter sp. 
Results Activated sludge and Arthrobacter sp. that were acclimated to 2, 4-D effectively 
degraded 2, 4-D and the lower metabolites of 2, 4-D, typically 2, 4-DCP. During the 
degradation of 2, 4-D, accumulations of the lower metabolites of 2, 4-D were not found. The 
degradation pathways acquired from acclimation to 2, 4-D are effective for all the metabolites 
of 2, 4-D. However, pathways acquired from acclimation to 2, 4-DCP are not effective in the 
degradation of the parent 2, 4-D. 
Conclusions Microorganisms acclimated to 2, 4-D evolve their degradation pathways by a 
scheme that is different from the scheme the microorganisms employ when they are

develop for a xenobiotic should be effective in degrading all its metabolites. It is of equal 
interest to see the microorganisms’ catabolism pathways for a xenobiotic organic, if it is a 
metabolite of a parent xenobiotic, are effective in the reverse direction to degrade all its 
parent's catabolism intermediates upstream of this xenobiotic organic. The chance of 
gaining this reversed-degradability advantage may come from the structure analog among 
the parent and the metabolites, so that the structure-degradability rules (Evangelista et al. 
2010) apply. If the pathways are common for all organics on the paths of the xenobiotic 
catabolism, treatment of related or similar organics can be easily managed in treatment 
plants that deal with the influent of a variety of such xenobiotic organics. The purposes of 
this study were to examine if the degradation mechanisms that were highly developed for a 
xenobiotic, using 2, 4-D as an example, were effective to degrade the parent’s lower 
metabolites, and if the reverse is true: the degradation mechanisms of the parent’s 
metabolites are effective for the degradation of the parent xenobiotic. 
2 Materials and methods 
2.1 Substrates and biomasses 
The xenobiotic substrates, each of which was subjected independently to acclimation 
and degradation tests, were 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D, the parent xenobiotic), 
and 2, 4-dichlorophenol (2, 4-DCP). Other metabolites of 2, 4-D, such as               
3, 5-dichlorocatechol and 2, 4-dichloro-cis, cis-muconate were not tested because these 
chemicals are rarely available as commercial products. Lower intermediates such as 
succinic acid were tested but were degraded easily.  
The biomasses used for acclimation and degradation of each substrate included a 
mixed culture activated sludge, and a pure culture of Arthrobacter sp. (DSM 20407). This 
pure strain is known to evolve a 2, 4-D degradation plasmid pJP4 (Chong and Chang, 
2009), thus it was used, as a known reference, for investigating whether the 2, 4-D

above. The shake flasks growth conditions included: agitation: 120 rpm orbital; 
temperature: room temperature at 25±2°C; pH: buffered at approximately 7.2.  
Measured amounts of the original (indigenous) biomasses of both activated sludge 
and the pure culture were inoculated into each acclimation reactor for the first-time 
acclimation and degradation of the xenobiotic. Biomasses that had completed a 
degradation reaction were used for the next re-acclimation or degradation of a target 
xenobiotic. Concentrations of the xenobiotic substrate that remained (not degraded) in a 
reactor were measured at regular intervals (typically 1 day) until complete xenobiotic 
degradation was found. Each degradation tests was repeated at least two (2) times. 
2, 4-D and 2, 4-DCP were measured using HPLC (Agilent 1200 Series), on each 
sample obtained from a xenobiotic degradation reactor. The samples were filtered (through 
Millipore Millex GS, pore size 0.22 μm). The column used was reverse phase C-18, length 
250 mm and φ 4.6 mm, with particle size 5 μm (Phenomenex Luna 00G-4041-E0). The 
mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (CH3CN) in H2O (80% v/v), pH adjusted to 4.0 with 
concentrated H3PO3. Flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Sample injection volume was 20.0 μl. 
Both 2, 4-D and 2, 4-DCP were detected in a single sample injection, by a UV detector at 
283 nm, at the retention times of 3.4-3.5 and 3.8-3.9 minutes, respectively, for 2, 4-D and  
2, 4-DCP. 
The concentrations of activated sludge Arthrobacter sp. biomasses were measured as 
their dried weight (SS). Biomass suspensions were filtered through fibre-glass filters 
(Whatman GF/C). SS measurements were performed following the standard methods 
(American Public Health Association 1998) of SM2540-D (filtered and dried at 
103~105°C). 
The initial concentrations of 2, 4-D and 2, 4-DCP in the batch degradation 
experiments were 111 mg/l (0.5mM) and 85 mg/l (0.5 mM), respectively, with biomass 
activated sludge. 100 and 50 mg/l of 2, 4-D and 2, 4-DCP, respectively, were use in tests

and the pure culture Arthrobacter sp.  
Additionally, Figs. 1d and 2d, when compared to Figs. 1a and 2a, respectively, show 
that 1) both biomasses took longer times to acclimation (longer lags) to 2, 4-DCP than to  
2, 4-D; 2) the degradation rates of 2, 4-DCP were slower than the degradation rates of    
2, 4-D by both biomasses. 
4 Discussion 
The study found evidence that in activated sludge and also in a pure culture, the     
2, 4-DCP (metabolite) degradation pathways are not effective for the degradation of 2, 4-D 
(parent). Since the microbial degradation of an organic compound is the result of the 
step-by-step catabolism of the organic, the genetic aspects of the catabolism 2, 4-D and   
2, 4-DCP are explored to find the plausible reasons that may explain the differences 
between the catabolism pathways used by the parent xenobiotic and its metabolite:  
For 2, 4-D, the majority of studies conducted over the years reported that the 2, 4-D 
metabolism genes are carried in the plasmid pJP4, which contains clusters of a gene series 
ranging from tfdA and tfdB to tfdCDEF. The first step of 2, 4-D catabolism that yields    
2, 4-DCP is encoded by the tfdA gene. The following steps of critical importance include 
the conversion of 2, 4-DCP to 3, 5-dichlorocatechol by a hydroxylase encoded by the tfdB 
gene, and a four-step modified ortho ring cleavage pathway by a chlorocatechol 
1,2-dioxygenase, encoded by the genes starting at tfdC (Koh et al. 1997; Ledger et al. 
2006). Evolution of pJP4 is induced by 2, 4-D (Chong and Chang 2009; Holben et al. 
1992). It is definitely true that once a biomass is acclimated to 2, 4-D, the degradation 
pathways thus evolved must be proficient enough that the biomass is capable of 
metabolizing 2, 4-D straight through to the central pathway entry points.  
For 2, 4-DCP, research reports generally treat 2, 4-DCP degradation in direct relation 
to that of 2, 4-D. Therefore, unfortunately, information about the gene groups that are 
independently induced by 2, 4-DCP for its catabolism is rare or obscure. Since 2, 4-DCP

oxidative damage to cell membranes and proteins, or the uncoupling effect on the electron 
transport chain (Sikkema et al. 1995). These toxicity effects may inactivate certain number 
of cells, hinder enzyme evolution, or disrupt the bioenergetics balances during metabolism. 
Therefore, the toxicity of 2, 4-DCP must assert a certain level of detrimental effect on the 
microorganisms when they are acclimating to the xenobiotic, causing longer lags, and also 
when they are degrading the xenobiotic after acclimation, causing slower degradation rates.  
From a practical point of view, the precise substrate specificity of the evolved 
catabolism genes is not a favorable feature that suits the objective of efficient treatment of a 
variety of xenobiotics. In the treatment of a xenobiotic organic, treatment plants would 
benefit if the degradation of the xenobiotic be improved by inducing activated sludge with 
organics that are the upper or lower intermediates of the catabolism of the xenobiotic. The 
results obtained from this study indicate that improvement of activated sludge xenobiotic 
treatment performance by pre-acclimation of the sludge to the xenobiotic’s lower 
metabolite(s) may be unreliable. 
5 Conclusions 
Both the mixed and pure cultures behave similarly in that they: 1) need an acclimation 
period when they first react with the xenobiotic 2, 4-D or 2, 4-DCP; 2) degrade the 
xenobiotics more efficiently (no lag) after each subsequent re-acclimations; 3) degrade 
metabolite (2, 4-DCP) readily after acclimation to the parent (2, 4-D); 4) their acclimation 
to the metabolite does not help their degradation of the parent. Overall, microorganisms 
acclimated to 2, 4-D evolve their degradation pathways through a scheme that is different 
from the scheme used by microorganisms that are acclimated to the metabolites of 2, 4-D.

for treating the influent xenobiotics. The doubt and concern about successful biological 
treatment of xenobiotics is twofold: a prolonged acclimation phase (length of lag time) 
before the start of degradation, and slow degradation kinetics after the lag. Between these 
two concerns, the more important one is often the acclimation lag time, rather than the 
treatment kinetics, which may be met with the adjustment of operating conditions within a 5
reasonable range, especially for those mildly persistent xenobiotics.  
Activated sludge biomass grown on the feed of biogenic substrate must be in a 
healthy physiological condition. These healthy conditions should be favorable to the 
microorganisms when they must go through the energy-expensive xenobiotic acclimation 
process. However, inconsistent results are found in literature about the effects of biogenic 10
organics on degradation of man-made xenobiotics or hydrocarbons. There have been some 
study cases of both beneficial and adverse effects of biogenic organics on xenobiotic 
degradation. The beneficial cases include: citrate on toluene (Harrison and Barker, 1987); 
natural amino acids on mono-substituted phenol (Shimp and Pfeander, 1985); natural 
organics such as manure on two chloro- and a nitro- herbicides (Moorman et al., 2001); 15
fatty acids on soil hydrocarbon (Nelson t al., 1996); pyruvate on naphthalene (Lee, 2003). 
Conversely, adverse cases are also found: glucose or amino acids on xylene and toluene 
(Swindoll et al., 1988); ethanol on benzene, toluent and xylene (Corseuil et al., 1998); 
glycolic acid and glucose on p-cresol (Lewis et al., 1986); yeast extract and milk on 
3-nitrobenzoate, 4-chlorobenzoate, 4-chlorophenol (Hu et al., 2005). 20
The microbiological aspects of xenobiotic degradation are examined here in order to 
diagnose the causes of the inconsistent results listed above about the effects of biogenic on 
xenobiotic degradation: 1) the involvement of symbiotic functions or co-metabolisms 
needed for the microbial communities to succeed in degrading the target xenobiotics. For 
the degradation of those xenobiotics in the examples listed above, the requirement of 25
ecological cooperation of the microbial communities should not be overly demanding; the 
microbial diversity that activated sludge contains can well satisfy the ecological needs for 
degradation of a xenobiotic solely (Sanapareddy et al., 2009; Wagner et al., 2002). This 
ecological factor can slightly affect xenobiotic acclimation in either the advantageous or 
the disadvantageous ways, if there is any effect at all. Therefore, the ecological factor can 30
have a neutral or unimportant effect on the efficiency of activated sludge in its acclimation 
to a xenobiotic. 2) The effect that activated sludge use a biogenic substrate preferentially 
to xenobiotic substrate (diauxic growth) (Basu et al., 2006; Chong and Chiou, 2010; 
Harder and Dijkhuizen, 1982). This factor can slow down xenobiotics acclimation and

The initial activated sludge seeds were obtained from a soil that did not have any 
record of 2, 4-D nor metal (slag) contamination. The mixed culture from soil was grown to 
a suitable amount on Nutrient Broth (NB Difco 234000) for a number of subcultures in 
shake-flasks before the culture was seeded to a long-term cultivation reactor that was 
operated in a fed-batch mode. The fed-batch reactor was fed once everyday with biogenic 5
substrates (100 mg/l sucrose and 25 mg/l peptone). The feed also contained minerals: 
FeCl3 1.0 mg/l, NH4Cl 30.0 mg/l, K2HPO4 200.0 mg/l, KH2PO4 156.0 mg/l, MgSO4 31.0 
mg/l. Reactor suspension, one tenth (1/10) of the liquid volume in the reactor tank, was 
wasted everyday so that a mean cell resident time (Tc) of 10 days was achieved. The 
fed-batch reactor was operated uninterrupted for a prolonged period to reach a 10
pseudo-steady state. The sludge obtained from this fed-batch reactor was referred to as the 
original sludge, which resembled the common activated sludge biomass produced from a 
continuous activated sludge treatment plant. 
2.2 Re-cultivations of activated sludge  15
This study employed a major experimental design referred to as the re-cultivation of 
the activated sludge biomass. The details of re-cultivation are as follow: 1) the biomass 
re-cultivated was harvested the fed-batch reactor; 2) the re-cultivating feed was biogenic 
in nature, consisting of sucrose and peptone at the proportion of 4:1 on the weight to 
weight basis (w/w). This ratio was kept constant when the biogenic feed concentration was 20
changed; 3) the re-cultivation times (the times at which the feed and biomass started 
reaction) were divided into three time segments relative to the start-time of a 2, 4-D 
acclimation and degradation reaction: before (pre-cultivation), concurrent, and after 
(post-cultivation). The biogenic re-cultivation scheme, with variations of re-cultivation 
time and biogenic substrate feed concentration, is listed in Table 1 (with designations of 25
the tests).  
The re-cultivation media contained minerals listed above, different concentrations of 
biogenic substrates (Table 1), and activated sludge thickened from the fed-batch reactor 
suspension with minimum carry-over of supernatant (sludge suspension settled for longer 
than 30 min and approximately 70% of supernatant discarded). The re-cultivation reactors 30
were operated in shake-flasks (300 ml conical flasks containing 150 ml liquid). The 
activated sludge concentration (measured as suspended solids, SS) initially added to the 
re-cultivation reactors was approximately 100 mg-SS/l. For the pre-cultivation reactors, 
biogenic feeds were administered once and the reactors were then let idle (shaking was

ȝm (Phenomenex Luna 00G-4041-E0). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile 
(CH3CN) in H2O (80% v/v), pH adjusted to 4.0 with concentrated H3PO3. Flow rate was 1 
ml/min. Sample injection volume was 20 Pl. Retention time was 3.5-3.8 minutes. 2, 4-D 
was detected by a UV detector at 283 nm. 
The concentration of activated sludge was measured as dried weight of suspended 5
solids (SS). Activated sludge samples were filtered through fibre-glass filters (Whatman 
GF/C), from which SS was determined from the filterable portion after drying. Biogenic 
substrate was measured using COD for selected tests. SS and COD measurements were 
performed following the standard methods (American Public Health Association, 1998) of 
SM2540-D (filtered and dried at 103~105qC) and SM5220-C (closed reflux, titrimetric), 10
respectively. 
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations (mass-ATP/mass-SS) were measured 
for activated sludge cells from the 0h and pre-cultivation reactors of the 100S test series 
(re-cultivation feed containing 100 mg/l sucrose and 25 mg/l peptone). Detailed ATP 
extraction, measurement, and calculation methods are reported in Chong, et al. (2010). 15
2.5 Acclimation kinetics 
The kinetics of acclimation was described with a mathematical acclimation model 
established by Chong (2009). The 2, 4-D data points obtained from an acclimation and 
degradation test were fitted with the output of the model. This model fitting gave 20
quantitative values of the length of lag time and the kinetics of degradation for an 
acclimation and degradation course. The values of all model parameters (see Ref. Chong 
(2009)) were set equal to those of the studies reported in Chong (2009), except Xmax, D,
and W which describe the degrader conversion rate in the model equation shown below (Eq. 
2 of Ref. Chong (2009)): 25
  (1) 
where Xa concentration of degraders (mg/l), Xmax maximum amount of degrader converted 
from non-degrader (mg/l), t is time (d), W time at which maximum conversion rate occurs 
(t), and Dmaximum Xa conversion rate (1/t).  30
Xmax, D, and Wof a 2, 4-D course were determined by non-linear regression in which a 
model output was fitted to a set experimental data points (average of duplicate tests). The 
regression program used was DNRLIN (double precision) of the IMSL library (Visual

growth rate (ȝm, Ks and Ki) and also Xmax are essentially constant, Ddetermines the overall 
time required for the complete degradation for the xenobiotic. The biogenic effects on 
xenobiotic acclimation are examined based on D and W (lag equivalence) in the following 
discussion, especially on the effect related to the sludge’s energy richness.  
5
3.2 Effects of diauxic growth 
Fig. 2 shows that both re-cultivation times and biogenic feed concentrations change 
the length of lag time. With respect to biogenic feed concentration, all feed concentrations 
help in shortening lag times compared to the original sludge. The 100S biogenic substrate 
produced sludge biomass that had the shortest lag time, followed closely by 200S, 50S, 10
and 20S (see Table 1 for concentrations of biogenic substrate in the re-cultivation feeds). 
This order of lag advantage suggests that there is an optimum feed concentration that is 
most effective in shortening acclimation lag time. 
With respect to the time of re-cultivation, sludge re-fed 3 days previously showed 
the shortest lag time for all biogenic feed concentrations, most noticeably 100S and 200S. 15
Lag times on both sides of 3-d re-cultivation time were longer than the shortest lag. The 
reasons behind the trend of the length of lag with respect to re-cultivation time are 
discussed below: 
(1) For short pre-cultivation times, including concurrent, 1-h, 8-h and even the 2-d 
re-cultivations, lag times are longer than the shortest lag at 3-d re-cultivation. In the 2, 4-D 20
acclimation reactors of these short re-cultivation times, biogenic substrates are present 
simultaneously with 2, 4-D for some period of time (see biogenic COD of the 0h100S, 
0h200S, and -1d100S tests in Fig. A.2). The lengthening of lag time by the presence of 
biogenic substrate with 2, 4-D simultaneously is best explained with the effect that the 
activated sludge biomass uses the biogenic substrates for growth in preference to 2, 4-D 25
(more commonly known as diauxic growth). Diauxic growth means that the sludge 
biomass has a chance to utilize the easy substrates, and thus the biomass temporarily 
ignores or escapes the xenobiotic acclimation stress. This pause of the acclimation process 
lets the xenobiotic intact for additional time, thereby causing the elongation of the 
acclimation lag time. Acclimation resumes, or in the worst case, the microorganisms must 30
restart a new acclimation process (Brandt et al., 2004), after the biogenic substrates are 
consumed to an extent near completion. Evidences of diauxic growth are found: 1) Early 
and extra SS growth shown for the 0-h case (Fig. A.3). In the 0-h tests, SS growth

intrinsic biological quality of the sludge. The sludge’s biological quality thus obtained can 
be more truly represented by a Tc that is most accurately operated. Under the present 
conditions, Tc of the original sludge (10 d in this case) can be considered equivalent to the 
re-cultivation time in expressing the sludge’s xenobiotic acclimation quality. Furthermore, 
the results of this study can extend the interpretation of Tc, from its conventional one such 5
as growth phase (or sludge age), to one including the sludge’s potency in acclimation to a 
xenobiotic. This new interpretation of Tc will provide a guideline for treatment plant 
operations coping with periodic xenobiotic influent. 
Overall, both the strength of biogenic substrates and the time point of biogenic 
presence relative to the biomass’ reaction with the xenobiotic are important in affecting 10
biomass’ acclimation lag time to the xenobiotic. A biogenic feed is inherently beneficial 
for xenobiotic degradation, except where the biogenic substrates exist concurrently with 
the xenobiotics and at strength high enough to cause a pause of the acclimation process. 
Detailed measurements of biogenic substrate concentrations that start or end the 
unfavorable diauxic growth are valuable for the precise modeling of the diauxic growth 15
effects.  
3.3 Effects of energy richness 
Despite that biogenic substrates, when pre ent, inevitably interfere with the sludge 
biomass’ acclimation to the xenobiotic, sludge re-grown on the biogenic helps the sludge 20
biomass in shortening lag when the biomass is to acclimate to 2, 4-D as the sole substrate. 
This benefit is mainly conferred by the sludge cells’ energy contents that were enriched 
from metabolizing the biogenic substrates. The well nourished sludge cells contain a high 
energy level to sustain the energy consuming xenobiotic acclimation process. To relate the 
biogenic effect on 2, 4-D acclimation, the ATP contents of the sludge cells at times after the 25
one-time feed of biogenic substrates (the 100S) were measured (see results in Fig. A.4).  
Fig. 3a shows that D, the maximum rate of degrader conversion, is positively 
proportional to the energy states (ATP levels) of the sludge cells. A mathematical function 
relating D with respect to ATP can be readily established. Because degradation rate is 
dependent on D, the overall 2, 4-D degradation rate is also proportional to ATP.  30
Fig. 3b shows the length of lag time with respect to ATP contents of the cells. 
Length of lag time decreases with the increase of ATP, only that the trend was broken by 
diauxic growth when the biogenic substrates were present during acclimation times.

with biogenic substrates 100S (100 mg/l sucrose and 25 mg/l peptone) at different 5
times before, concurrent, or after the sludge’s acclimation reaction with 2, 4-D. 
Experimental data (data points) were fitted with the acclimation model (lines), 
which calculated lag time and acclimation and degradation kinetics.

及時提出相對的主張，並訂出 agenda。這些遠見都是主管機構會同產業界及學界共同合作集
思廣益而得到者。如同上述歐盟的願景，有主張也有行動剛領，展現一國之氣度。反觀我國
參與的情形，以個人平凡的位階來看，實有不足之處，也對於為何有如此差距，不能了解。
而相對之下，只覺得個人著重如何促成單一研究課題能夠發表，對於水環境的大動向，了解
的程度及參與度竟是相距甚遠。這種無能為力的感覺，影響所至，使得個人對自己的研究子
題，失去若干的自我感覺良好。 
   至於學術/科技研究子題方面，生物方法仍然是傾向分子生物方法，研究方向大致可以掌
握，對於提升個人研究靈活度有所幫助。而因世界之大學者之眾，各式題目可說應有盡有，
如污泥通電可提高沉降等。新鮮的研發子題，個人能力及時間有限，能夠嘗試者很少也。

compared to the original sludge. Sludge fed with sucrose 3 days previously showed 
the shortest lag time. Starting from the 5-day case, lag shortening advantage decreased. 
When 12 days had passed before the sludge reacted with 2, 4-D, the effect of sugar on 
the sludge had diminished to a level that acclimation pattern became similar to the 
original sludge. The original sludge, as a reference, was obtained from a continuous 
flow reactor (fed-batch mode) operated at a mean cell residence time of 10 day.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 1.1 shows the models’ ability to simulate closely the biomass (dry weight as SS) 
growth and substrate depletion courses during batch mode acclimation and degradation 
reaction of activated sludge on a selected xenobiotic organic 2, 4-dichlorphenoxyacetic 
acid (2, 4-D). The simplified model is also satisfactory, with comparatively milder 
transition from lag to degradation for both the S and X curves. 
 
Both the complete and simplified models are suitable for continuous flow system when 
mass balances for S and X inflow and outflow are incorporated. Figure 1.2 shows a 
close match between the 2, 4-D concentration predicted by the model and the effluent 
of a lab scale activated sludge reactor during reactor start-up. Detailed system 
fluctuation was not adequately simulated. The fluctuation may possibly be simulated 
with a model formulation that defines the instability in interactions among the 
xenobiotic substrate, the reacting biomass, and the hydraulic characteristics.
