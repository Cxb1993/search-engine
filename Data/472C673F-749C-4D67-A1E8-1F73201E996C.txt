timing-driven routing tree. To attain the timing- and 
interference-free routing tree, three important viewpoints are 
used for illustration. In the first viewpoint, a partitioning which 
divided the entire chip into k sub-regions by source position is 
applied. Fro each sub-region, the routing paths are routed 
within the given routing region, while the maximum 
source-to-target length is reduced [8]. In this paper, the 
maximum source-to-target length ( maxL  for short) is used to 
measure the performance of the routing tree. In the second 
stage, an efficient overlapping-based approach, which 
produces the bounding box for dedicated nodes per iteration 
and the longer overlapping length prioritized to determine the 
routing pattern, is presented to reduce total wire length. In the 
third viewpoint, we observed that the proposed approach which 
reserved the user-defined silicon space can reduce the 
interference between the on-chip wires and wires. The number 
of interconnections with interference violations is defined as 
cN  and the symbol is used to measure potential crosstalk. 
Sufficient space was reserved around all obstacles in advance 
and interference between wires and on-chip wires is reduced.

Figure 1.  Timing- and interference-free routing tree. 
Figure 1 is used to explain the importance of partitioning 
and reservation for construction of the timing-driven tree. 
Figure 1(a) shows the traditional routing result with maxL = 9 
and cN  = 2. It means that there are two interconnections with 
interference-violations and this routing tree has a serious 
maximum source-to-target length. If we use the partitioning 
which limits the routing region, the value of maxL  can be 
improved. Figure 1(b) yields the result with maxL = 7 and 
improvement of the maximum length from source to target. 
However, the interference is still serious. If we reserve the 
silicon area for all obstacles, the interference can be improved. 
Figure 1(c) yield the result with maxL = 8 and cN  =0 and the 
number of interference-violation can be reduced to zero. Based 
on the observation, the maxL and cN  (interference) are 
improved through timing-driven partitioning and space 
reservation for all obstacles. Data skew is defined as the 
difference between the maximum and minimum 
source-to-target length [16]. Hence, the data skew can be 
reduced if the maxL  is improved by the partitioning. This 
observation motives us to build a timing-driven routing tree to 
simultaneously minimize the maximum length from source to 
target and the number of interconnections with interference 
violations. 
B. Problem Definition  
The allowed routing directions of all layers are different. 
The directions of the odd and even layers are horizontal and 
vertical segments. A user-defined distance is reserved 
(abbreviated as rd  ) to all obstacles to improve the interference 
between on-chip wires and wires. The problem can be defined 
as follows, 
   Given a set of terminals { 1 2 3, , ,. . . , nt t t t } and a set of 
obstacles { 1 2 3,  ,  ,  . . . ,  mb b b b }. For a source s  and a set of 
routing layers { 1 2 3,  ,  ,  . . . ,  lyrl l l l }, the entire chip is divided by 
the user-defined number of sub-regions, named k. For all 
obstacles, a user-defined reserved distance rd  is allocated 
around obstacles. The objective of this work is simultaneously 
minimizes the maximum length from source to target ( maxL ), 
data skew ( skwL ), and the number of interconnections with 
potential crosstalk ( cN ) among obstacles.  
III. TIMING- AND INTERFERENCE-FREE  ALGORITHM 
In the section, we construct the timing and interference routing 
tree and discuss in detail. 
A. Pre-processing for obstacles 
To reduce the interference between the on-chip wires and 
off-chip wires, the user-defined distance is reserved ( rd  for 
short) for obstacles. Figure 2 illustrates a two-terminal net with 
an obstacle. Originally, the net is near obstacles and the 
interference appears. After performing the space reservation 
technique, the interference is improved because there is 
sufficient space between the net and the obstacle.

B. Timing-Driven Partitioning  
To avoid the serious detour routing which leads to the large 
maximum source-to-target length, the concept of multiple 
partitioning is involved into divide terminals into a set of 
sub-regions and then connecting all terminals into a routing tree. 
First, the k sub-regions are produced according to the source 
position. At this stage, the detour routing is still serious. Second, 
for each sub-region, the k sub-regions are iteratively generated 
by the center of gravity in each sub-region. After this stage, the 
detour routing is significantly improved. Some outcomes are 
discussed in the experimental results. Figure 3 illustrates the 
procedure of timing-driven partitioning which projects all 
terminals onto a plane, divides terminals by the source position 
and partitions by the center of gravity of each sub-region. If a 
source is located at the corner point, the method constructs a 
feasible routing tree with less length reduction.

C. Efficient Overlapping-Driven Routing Tree Algorithm 
To efficiently and effectively construct the routing tree, an 
overlapping-driven concept is integrated into the algorithm. For 
a set of terminals, a spanning graph is constructed according the

Timing- and Interference-Free Multi-layer Routing Tree  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abstract—In this paper, we proposed the formulation of one 
timing-driven routing problem with consideration of interference 
by an efficient geometry-based approach. The objective of this 
work aims to simultaneously minimize the maximum length from 
source to target, and the potential interference nets for the 
multilayer routing system. Most approaches in the literatures 
neglected to the interference and most papers commonly 
improved the routing qualities by using post-processing. A space 
reservation technique is involved into the timing-driven router to 
further reduce the interference among on-chip wires and wires of 
boards. Second, a timing-driven partitioning which divides the 
entire chip into a set of sub-regions by source position is followed 
by the center of gravity of each sub-region to reduce the data 
skew. For each sub-region, the obstacle-avoiding routing 
algorithm is performed to connect all terminals. Experimental 
results show that the number of potential crosstalk nets is 
reduced. Moreover, the maximum length from source to target 
and data skew in the routing tree are improved by 35.0% and 
36.3 %, respectively. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
The benefits of multi-layer IC contain the reduction of 
total wire length, total silicon area and shorter time-to-market. 
The related researches for three-dimension IC contain the 
floorplanning [1], placement [2], packaging [3] and routing [4] 
with different objectives such as minimization of total wire 
length, and area. Routing for multiple terminals was a 
fundamental problem in the two- and three dimension chip 
architecture. For the tree routing with three-dimension 
architecture, many design issues, such as timing (maximum 
delay from source to target and skew), interference (crosstalk) 
and extra delay, were appeared as the operation frequency 
became increasingly faster.  
With regarding to routing problems, many researches 
reduce the maximum delay from source (primary input) to 
targets (primary outputs) to obtain a timing-driven routing tree 
[5][6]. As the nanometer technology was supported in VLSI 
design, timing issue got more and more important and was 
widely studied in recently year. Ma et al. [7] observed that the 
detour routing worsened the serious maximum delay from 
source to target. Chang et al. [8] provided the timing-driven 
algorithm to reduce the maximum source-to-target delay with 
the non-rectangular and rectangular obstacles. The X-
architecture which supported the horizontal, vertical and 
diagonal segments was incorporated into the router to further 
improve the delay. Hu et al. [9] provided the concept of the 
soft edge for the timing driven routing tree construction. The 
Steiner points of the routing tree were adjusted to the 
predefined locations to meet timing requirements. Lin et al. 
[10] utilized the recalling modification method to change the 
routing tree structure. The provided method calculated the 
delay of terminals in the routing tree and rerouted the timing-
violated terminal with huge number of iterations. One 
approach was attained with better results by relaxing the 
bound of the radius-ratio and the other rerouted the critical 
path with larger radius-ratio. However, most approaches did 
not take into consideration of obstacles and some approaches 
applied post-processing to reduce timing violations. 
Coupling capacitance among wires was the major source 
of interference. For 0.25 um process, coupling was from 70% 
to 80% of total wiring capacitance [11]. For interference 
reduction, shield insertion, track permutation, wire sizing, and 
gate sizing are developed at global or detailed routing stage. 
Moreover, many heuristic or mathematical approaches, such 
as sequential-based, multiple stage-based Lagrangian 
relaxation, are incorporated into the router with the one- or 
two-bend pattern routings. Zhang et al. [12] provided a shield 
insertion technique which routed the power and ground wires 
among wires to minimize the capacitive coupling. Xiong et al. 
studied a routing problem with RLC constraints by using a 
multi-phase approach which simultaneously considered the 
net ordering and inserted the shields among signal wires [13]. 
Nonetheless, the accurate parasitic extraction of the detailed 
router was not involved into the router .Kastner et al. [14] 
applied L-shaped routing pattern to reduce crosstalk at global 
routing. However, the accuracy of estimated crosstalk was 
dominated because of the limitation of one bend routing 
pattern. Pan et al. [15] presented track permutation and wire 
sizing techniques to reduce crosstalk after the detailed routing 
stage. However, most approaches, which minimized the 
interference at post-routing stage, took a great amount of 
runtime to adjust the wire delay.  
In this work, the main contributions are as follows. First, 
one timing- and interference-free multi-layer routing tree 
problem (TI-TREE for short) is defined and an effective and 
efficient method is provided to solve the problem. Second, the 
multiple partitioning which divides the entire chip by the 
source position and a set of center of gravity of each sub-
region is developed. Third, the space reservation technique 
which reserved the sufficient space around obstacles is used to 
improve the interference between the on-chip wires and wires. 
Finally, the geometry-based approach which determines the 
direction of the routing pattern (the upper or low L-shaped) is 
used to efficiently construct the tree with obstacles.  
The reminder of this work is organized as follows. Section 
II presents the motivation and problem definition. Section III 
discusses the algorithm to improve multiple objectives. 
Experimental results and conclusions are shown in Sections 
IV and V, respectively.  
II. PRELIMINARY 
In the section, we discuss the motivation, including three 
viewpoints, corresponding examples, and problem definition. 
A. Motivation  
Unlike the length-driven routing tree minimizes total wire 
length ( talL
 
for short), we focus on how to construct the 
timing-driven routing tree. To attain the timing- and 
interference-free routing tree, three important viewpoints are

shaped pattern routing is applied to realize the routing paths. 
The net order is determined by the overlapping length. Finally, 
a feasible routing tree is constructed. Figure 4 illustrates the 
efficient routing tree construction, including spanning graph, 
minimal spanning tree and rectilinear Steiner tree with 
consideration of obstacles. By above discussions, a timing-
driven routing tree is constructed. Figure 5 shows the TI-TREE 
algorithm to solve the problem of this work.

IV. EXPERIEMTJNAL RESULLTS 
The proposed algorithm was implemented and testing by 
utilizing C++ language on an Intel machine with 2.8GHz CPU 
and 2.5G memory. The related benchmarks in this work were 
modified from [8] because there is lack of standard multi-layer 
design data, containing terminals and obstacles. Benchmark 
statistics used in the paper are listed in TABLE I. 
First, we compare the interference of the routing tree 
without and with the reservation space. The first, second and 
third columns denote the benchmark name, number of 
terminals and number of obstacles, respectively. The 
traditional and partitioned routing results are shown in the 
fourth and fifth columns. In the fourth column in TABLE I, 
the number of potential interference interconnection without 
space reservation is 52.8 in average. In contrast, the number of 
potential interference interconnection is significantly reduced 
to 0.5. The violated interconnects are resulted from the 
terminals staying close to obstacles. Actually, the number of 
violated interconnection can be reduced to zero if terminals 
are far away obstacles. Similarly, the interference between on-
chip wires and wires are also improved for the partitioned 
timing-driven routing tree (k=4). It means that the space 
reservation technique is effectively to reduce the interference.  
Second, we investigate the reduction of
maxL . In TABLE 
II, the symbols “2(x)” and “2(y)” denote the routing results 
which we divide the chip area into two sub-regions by the x-
axis and y-axis passing through the source position. From the 
table, we conclude that the maxL  (k=1) of the traditional 
routing tree is reduced by applying the TI-TREE method for 
most benchmarks except D5. Results with only one 
partitioning by the source position are applied to obtain the 
routing results of “2(x)” and “2(y)”. We observed that the 
maxL values in most circuits were also improved when the TI-
TREE (k=4) was applied to construct the timing routing tree. 
Compared with the 
maxL  in the traditional routing tree (k=1), 
the maxL (k=4) in timing-driven routing tree is improved 35.0% (=(21276.7-13821.5)/21276.7) in average. It means that multiple 
partitioning can significantly reduce the maxL .We know the 
data skew is the difference between the maximum source-to-
target length and the minimum source-to-target length. Hence, 
the data skews of the traditional routing tree (k=1) are also 
improved by 36.3% (=(20538.5-13083.3)/20538.5) through TI-
TREE (k=4).  
Third, we further observed the wire length reduction 
when the routing resources are increased from 2 layers to 4 
layers. The routing layers of Tables II and III are 2 and 4 
layers, respectively. In Tables II and III, terminals and 
obstacles are assigned to layers 1 and 2. In Table III, the 
layers 3 and 4 were emptied to support the horizontal and 
vertical tracks. Compared to the maxL  and skwL in Table II, the 
maxL  and skwL  in Table III are further reduced because the 
additional routing layers 3 and 4 are supported. Figure 6 lists 
the routing results of D6 benchmark. Figures 6(a) and (b) are 
the routing results of layers 1 and 2, respectively. Because 
there are no obstacles and terminals in routing layers 3 and 4, 
only the horizontal and vertical routing tracks are shown in 
Figures 6(c) and (d), respectively.  The routing paths of
maxL  
in k=4 and k=1 are shown in Figure 6(e) and (f). We observed 
that the maxL  in k=4 is significantly improved to be a better 
timing-driven routing tree. Moreover, the runtime of the 
proposed TI-TREE algorithm is further reduced because the 
concept of divide-and-conquer by timing-driven partitioning. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This work formulates the TI-TREE problem and solves the 
problem by the geometry-based approach. Independently from 
the technique parameters, the interference between on-chip 
wires and wires are significantly improved because the user-
defined reserved silicon space is allocated around obstacles. By 
considering the distribution of terminals, the maxL were reduced 
by applying the portioning according to source and other 
centers of gravity of each partitioned region. Compared with 
the method (k=1), maxL and skwL of TI-TREE (k=4) of the 
multiple-layer architecture are reduced with 35.0% and 36.3%.
