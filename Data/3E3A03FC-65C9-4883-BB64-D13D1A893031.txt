Actually, most pores within FWKC6000 are smaller than 4 nm,
suggesting that the KOH/char ratio of 6.0 may be a critical
value influencing the development of mesopores for the KOH
activation process. From curves 9–11 (i.e., for FWKC1015,
FWKC1030 and FWKC1060, respectively), on the other hand,
a large proportion of mesopores was formed within these ACs
(with the pore diameter ≤5 nm). Moreover, the pore size dis-
tribution is gradually widened with prolonging the gasification
time.
The pore properties, including Sp, Sext/Sp, Vpore, Vmeso/Vpore,
and Dp, of the ACs prepared from the above three activation
methods are listed in Table 1. In the case of steam-activated car-
bons, prolonging tA leads to an increase in the Sp, Sext/Sp, Vpore,
and Vmeso/Vpore. When the activation time is prolonged from 1 to
7 h, Sp is increased from 528 to 1131 m2 g−1; Vpore is increased
from 0.35 to 0.87 cm3 g−1; and Vmeso/Vpore is increased from
0.33 to 0.52. These are typical properties of ACs with high
ratios of mesopores, which have been discussed in our previ-
ous work [23]. In the case of KOH-activated ACs, increasing
the KOH/char ratio from 0.5 to 6 renders an increase in Sp

tensities of both CO2 and CO evolution at tempera-

the density and distribution of oxygen functional
the surface of FWKC1015 should be very suitable,
its highest specific capacitance. In addition, the pos-
