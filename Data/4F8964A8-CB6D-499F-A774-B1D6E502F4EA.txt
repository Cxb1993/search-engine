Abstract 
 
 Torrefaction is a pretreatment technology to improve the properties of biomass. 
The biomass undergoing torrefaction process possesses several advantages, such as 
decreasing moisture of biomass, increasing energy content and heating value. In 
addition, torrefied biomass advantages gasification phenomenon by increase of the 
heating value and decrease of moisture. 
The purposes of this study are to develop a numerical method and to investigate 
the individual gasification phenomena of three different fuels in an entrained-bed 
gasifier. The fuels include a high-volatile bituminous coal, a raw bamboo and a 
torrefied bamboo. In the simulations, oxygen is used as an oxidant and air blown as the 
carrier gas in the gasifier where the pressure is 2 MPa and the wall is adiabatic. 
The predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental data, 
elucidating the successful numerical method. Regarding the torrefied bamboo, it is 
pretreated in a nitrogen environment with 280°C for 1 h. The performance of the 
gasification is identified through the observations of carbon conversion (CC) and cold 
gas efficiency (CGE). 
The obtained results suggest that the coal provides the best performance of 
gasification. The CGE of torrefied bamboo is increased 20% compared to that of the 
raw bamboo. Moreover, the better CC or CGE are exhibited at the oxygen-to-fuel ratio 
of 0.7-0.8 for the torrefied bamboo and coal. Consequently, the properties of bamboo 
are modified to close to the coal, when the bamboo undergoes the torrefaction process.

produced the minimum formation of agglomerates and the Fischer-Tropsch catalyst 
successfully generated liquid hydrocarbons in the packed-bed configuration with 
product gas recycle. 
Reviewing the recent literature, the results shown that the after the torrefaction 
process, the properties of biomass are improved to a great extent. So, the topic of 
torrefaction is worth to study. In addition, it also shows that no research uses numerical 
method to investigate the torrefaction with gasification. Therefore, the objective of this 
study is to develop a numerical method to predict gasification phenomena and figure 
out the gasification characteristics of coal, raw biomass and torrefied biomass. 
 
2 NUMERICAL METHOD 
 
2.1 Geometry and assumptions 
This study is to develop a numerical method to investigate the gasification 
performance in an entrained-flow gasifier. Particular emphases are placed on the 
gasification characteristics of coal, raw biomass and torrefied biomass. Further, this 
study expects to find the suitable operating condition for each feeds. The schematic of 
the investigated entrained-flow gasifier is shown in Fig. 1. It is a dry feed, pressurized 
entrained-flow gasifier with the capacity of 2 metric ton per day [13]. As shown in Fig. 
1a, the height of the gasifier is 5,151.2 mm and the width is 270.3 mm. The inlet 
configuration consists of a center inlet and a concentric ring inlet. The center inlet and 
concentric ring inlet are referred to as the fuel inlet and oxygen inlet. In addition, the 
distance of oxygen inlet to the gasifier centerline is 45mm. The diameter of the fuel 
inlet is 20 mm. Further, the width of oxygen inlet is 5 mm.

the gasifier. 
Seeing that the investigated phenomena are related to fluid motion, heat and mass 
transfers as well as chemical reactions, some assumptions are adopted to simplify the 
physical problem. They include: (1) the flow field is steady, axisymmetric, 
incompressible and turbulent; (2) the radiation and body force of the flow in the 
gasifier are ignored; (3) the formation of air pollutants such as SOx and NOx are 
disregarded; (4) the wall temperature of the gasifier is uniform. Because of the

After undergoing fast heating, the hot flow around fuel particles will trigger a 
number of physical and chemical reactions [18]. 
When the char is produced from fuel devolatilization, CO and H2 can be 
generated from char gasification. The char gasification is featured by the following

4 Results and Discussion 
 
4.1 Gasification of various fuels 
This study is investigated the gasification phenomenon on different fuel type such 
as coal, raw bamboo and torrefied bamboo. The key indices are include gasification 
temperature, syngas yield and production gas component. Further, the carbon 
conversion (CC) and cold gas efficiency (CGE) are used to be the indices due to more 
understand the gasification performance clearly. The CC and CGE are two important 
indices in accounting for the performance of gasification process. CC and CGE are 
expressed as follows [24]:

In the current study, CC is evaluated from the concentrations of CO2, CO and CH4 
in the product gas, whereas CGE is determined from the concentrations of H2, CO and 
CH4. 
In this section, gasification phenomena at various fuel types such as coal, raw 
bamboo and torrefied bamboo are investigated in the same operating condition. The 
fuel is fed into the gasifier from the fuel inlet and oxygen is blown into the gasifier at 
the oxygen inlet. In addition, the oxygen to fuel ratio (O/F ratio), the mass flow rates of 
fuel and air are controlled at 0.9, 0.023 kg s
-1
 and 0.025 kg s
-1
. The temperature 
distributions at the aforementioned operating modes are displayed in Fig. 3. The figure 
shows that the high-temperature region in the vicinity of the fuel and oxygen inlet is 
due to the exothermic coal combustion. In contrast, the temperature decreases 
downward, as a consequence of the endothermic gasification reaction. Further, the 
maximum temperature region is shown variation by different fuel type. The coal 
gasification makes the highest temperature about 2,800K. For the raw bamboo 
gasification, it is shown the maximum temperature is about 1,300K at the upstream 
 10 
bamboo with the torrefaction temperatures of 280°C. 
 
 
Figure 5 CO and H2 concentration profiles of coal, raw bamboo and torrefied 
bamboo with the torrefaction temperatures of 280°C. 
 
An examination of the gaseous concentrations in the product gas is shown in Fig. 
6a. The result indicates that torrefaction facilitates the concentrations of H2 and CO.  
With further examination of syngas concentration shown in Fig. 6a, the syngas value of 
bamboo is increased from 0.17 to 0.36 and the syngas formation is apparently sensitive 
to the torrefaction process. In addition, considering the CC and CGE in figure 6b, the 
result is shown that the CGE of bamboo is increased about 20% by torrefaction process. 
However, the CC value doesn’t change drastically. 
The reason of this result is that the CGE dependent on the heating value effect of 
H2, CO and CH4. Therefore, the above result is shown increment the H2 and CO 
concentrations while causes to increase the CGE value. The performance of raw 
biomass gasification is insufficient because of lower heating value which results in a 
lower cold gas efficient. However, the raw bamboo undergoing torrefaction can 
efficiently improve its gasification performance. This viewpoint is consistent with 
results of Deng et al. [10]. On the other hand, the explanation for CC is that the CC is 
dependent on the mole fraction of CO2, CO and CH4. The result is shown the 
concentration of CO is increased but the concentration of CO2 is tiny increased. This 
situation makes to maintain the CC value. In summary, the torrefaction process can 
improve the gasification phenomenon of biomass.

The gas component of raw bamboo gasification is shown in table 6. When the O/F 
ratio is increased, the result is displayed that the concentration variations of the CO2 
and CO are similar to coal. Further, the result of gas component is presented that the 
H2O content of bamboo is higher than coal. Therefore, the gasification reaction is 
hindered and the maximum temperature is decreased by this reason. For the results 
compare with the coal, the CC and CGE of raw bamboo is lower than coal about 30% 
to 50%. The highest value of the CC is appeared on the O/F ratio at 0.9 and the highest 
value of CGE is exhibit on 1.0. Hence, the suitable O/F ratio of coal gasification is 
suggested from 0.9 to 1.0.

The gas component of torrefied bamboo gasification is shown in table 7. The 
result is displayed that it compares with the raw bamboo; the H2O content of torrefied 
bamboo is decreased apparently. Further, the CC and CGE of torrefied bamboo is 
increased about 10% to 30%. This means that the torrefaction can modify the 
gasification performance of bamboo. On the other hand, the highest value of the CC is 
appeared on the O/F ratio at 0.8 and the highest value of CGE is exhibit on 0.7. 
Therefore, the suitable O/F ratio of torrefied bamboo gasification is suggested from 0.7 
to 0.8. Consequently, the calculation result is indicated that the gasification 
performance of the biomass is modified by torrefaction and this result makes the 
indexes of gasification, such as heating value, CC, CGE and gas component, close to 
coal.
