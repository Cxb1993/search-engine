2. Model derivation
2.1. Two-dimensional potential analysis
Referring to Fig. 1 and assuming the channel doping to be uni-
form, the Poisson equation for potential Uðr; zÞ in DMSG MOSFETs
when it operated in subthreshold region where the free electron
concentration is much less than the impurity doping density is

where Na is the channel doping concentration, and the r-axis is per-
pendicular and the z-axis is parallel to the channel, respectively. By
using the superposition method to solve Eq. (1), the resultant solu-
tion Uiðr; zÞ can be decomposed into one-dimensional (1D) potential
solution ViðrÞ and 2D potential solution Uiðr; zÞwhich satisfy the fol-
lowing 2D Laplace equation and 1D Poisson equation, respectively.
It leads to
Uiðr; zÞ ¼ ViðrÞ þ Uiðr; zÞ; i ¼ 1;2 ð2Þ
where i = 1, 2 is for regions 1 and 2 where material 1 (M1) and mate-
rial 2 (M2) are used for the dual-material gates. By making use of the
following boundary conditions, Eq. (2) can be achieved:
(A) Potential at the interface of the two different gate materials
is continuous
U1ðr; L1Þ ¼ U2ðr; L1Þ ð3Þ

where VGS is the gate-to-source bias, VFB1 and VFB2 are the ﬂat
band voltages of material 1 and material 2 and given as the
difference of the gate material work function and silicon
work function /M1  /s and /M2  /s, respectively. Note that
t0ox in (7), which is required to derive the continuity of electric
ﬂux at the interface between silicon and oxide, comes from
the basic idea of cylindrical capacitor [13,14].
(D) Potential at the source end is
U1ðr; 0Þ ¼ Vbi ð8Þ

U2ðr; L1 þ L2Þ ¼ Vbi þ VDS ð9Þ
where Vbi is the built-in potential across the interface be-
tween source/drain side and silicon body and VDS is drain
bias. The V1ðrÞ;U1ðr; zÞ;V2ðrÞ, and U2ðr; zÞ can be found from
the boundary conditions mentioned above. From equations
of (2), (5), (6), (8), and (9), the solutions for V1ðrÞ and V2ðrÞ

portion of the device. For the vertical cylindrical surrounding gate
MOSFET’s as shown in Fig. 1, the threshold voltage is deﬁned by the
gate voltage in region 1, where the minimum surface potential
equals two times of bulk potential. i.e.,

Substituting (23) into (27) and solving for VGS, the threshold

It should be noted that as L1k1  1, the threshold voltage as
shown in (28) can be further reduced to

which is consistent with the threshold voltage for the long-channel
device.
2.2.1. Results and discussion
Fig. 5 shows the threshold voltage versus the channel length for
different drain biases and the simulated results of Ref. [10] are also
included for comparison. The plot indicates that the threshold volt-
age decreases rapidly when the channel length decreases, particu-
larly for the drain bias increased to 1.5 V. This is because the gate
gradually loses control of the channel as the drain bias steadily
increases to initiate DIBL. It is obviously seen that our model is
superior to that of Ref. [10] for obtaining a good agreement with
numerical simulation. It should be pointed out that as the device
length reduced below 60 nm, the assumption of ðL1 þ L2Þk1  1
as shown in Eq. (28) (in this case, k1  7:0 105 cm1 and
ðL1 þ L2Þk1 < 4) will become less supported and the difference be-
tween our model and device simulator is going to become larger.
The ﬁgure indicates that to obtain a close agreement between
the model and simulator, the criterion of ðL1 þ L2Þk1 P 6 should
be satisﬁed. Fig. 6 depicts the threshold voltage versus the channel
length for different gate oxide thicknesses. It is clearly revealed
that the threshold voltage roll-off increases fast with the channel
length decreasing. The thin gate oxide can provide better gate con-
trol ability than the thick oxide and hence gains the low threshold
voltage degradation. In practice, the gate oxide cannot be reduced
below a certain limit because the tunneling current will occur. For
example, when the thickness is scaled down below 3 nm [17], the

applied to ﬁnd the integration for the charge density of Qj as
shown in Eq. (44). The red line1 indicates how the trapezoidal rule
is used to ﬁnd the integration of Qj as rL > 0:1. For example, here we
take m = 2 to illustrate the integration and ﬁnd the charge density
of Qj by using the formula of (45). The dependence of the sub-
threshold current on the gate bias with channel length as a param-
eter is shown in Fig. 8. It can be observed that the subthreshold
current value is in good agreement with simulation results and
that the subthreshold current for the device with L = 100 nm shows
two orders of subthreshold leakage when compared to the long
channel devices of L = 200 nm and L = 500 nm. Fig. 9 shows the
dependence of subthreshold current on the gate bias with silicon
ﬁlm thickness as a parameter. From the plot, the thin value of
r ¼ tsi2 ¼ 10 nm can have a lower subthreshold leakage current in
comparison to those thick silicon bodies. However, regardless of
higher subthreshold leakage, those thick silicon bodies can provide
sufﬁcient driving current which is proportional to pt2si as indicated
in Eq. (49) and increase the device speed that causes the less cir-
cuits propagation delay when the device is used for low-power cir-
cuit application [21]. The trade-off between how to keep low
subthreshold degradation and to have high driving capability
should be accounted for simultaneously as the device is designed
for the circuit application.
2.4. Subthreshold swing model
According to the deﬁnition of the subthreshold swing

and by using (49), the subthreshold swing can be obtained as

It is interesting to note that as the channel length is much long-
er than 1, i.e. (ðL1 þ L2Þk1  1), the term of S10 affected by the SCEs
can be ignored and the subthreshold swing will be reduced to the
ideal value of 60 mV/decade (¼ kTq ln 10) which agrees with the
subthreshold swing of long-channel device.
2.4.1. Results and discussion
Fig. 10 shows the dependence of the subthreshold swing on the
channel length for different gate oxide thicknesses. The much thin-
ner oxide is preferred to suppress the SCEs more efﬁciently due to
the less subthreshold swing degradation. As the gate oxide be-
comes thinner, the vertical ﬁeld from gate terminal can more easily
penetrate into the channel and enhance the gate control capability
which reduces the subthreshold degradation. Fig. 11 shows the
dependence of the subthreshold swing on the channel length for
different silicon ﬁlm thicknesses. It is obviously seen that the thin-
ner silicon ﬁlm can provide the more efﬁcient suppression of SCEs
for the devices, which results in the less subthreshold egradation.
As a consequence, the thin ﬁlm is another key parameter we
should account for to reduce the subthreshold swing degradation
when we design the device for the subthreshold operation. It
