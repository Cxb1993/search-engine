neurobiology, and drug screening. Recent studies of 
C. elegans behavior show increasing use of 
quantitative measurements, both on agar surfaces and 
in liquid media. However, most prior works were 
limited to a short time scale, typically seconds or 
minutes. Behaviors that occur on a time scale of 
hours or days, such as sleep-like behaviors, remain 
understudied. Massive measurements on agar surfaces 
for a long time scale are also difficult due to poor 
image recognition. Required for the long term (hours 
to days) behavioral observations of single C. elegans 
worms is a method to confine worms to small arenas 
for continuous viewing. We propose a method for long 
term continuous parallel observations of multiple 
(~100) single worms using lab in a drop (LID) system. 
A dynamic LID generates droplets and encapsulates 
worms with two-phase flow. The droplet manipulation 
for image recording can be achieved by hydrodynamics 
or external force fields. The novelties of LID 
include (1) confined space with minimum interference, 
(2) adjustable living space, (3) simple 
microfabrications, (4) massively parallel 
measurements, (5) capability of dynamic manipulation. 
 
In the first year, we have developed a static droplet 
array microchip and characterized the worm in a 
confined medium. Each well was filled with the NGM 
buffer and liquid bacteria (E-coli) and covered with 
mineral oil to prevent evaporation. A worm living in 
such an isolated system can survive for 5 days. Since 
the microchip deals with no sophisticated structures, 
wells can be arranged very close to each other 
forming a compact pattern. In a well-established 
condition, we achieved a long-term recording with 35 
worms on the same microchip. Meanwhile, a simple 
image analysis algorithm was also developed to 
accelerate the work. To quantify the status of the 
worm’s motility, three statistical parameters 
relevant to lethargus were defined in the study. 
After comparing the parameters between the wile type 
worms (N2) and the mutants (egl-4), significant 
differences were found in good agreement with those

1. 前言  
液滴在現今許多研究上已經被廣泛開發為低成本與高效率的生化反應平台。提供足夠的食物與氧氣，
我們甚至可以在隔離的液滴內培養多細胞生物，如秀麗引桿線蟲，超過一個生命週期以上。藉此我們
可以在不受外界干擾的情況下長期、大量地記錄線蟲活動。一顆條件良好的液滴，根據我們的研究，
可以維持單一線蟲5天以上的壽命。在液滴內我們除了觀測線蟲運動狀態之外，同時也發現線蟲具備
某種程度的睡眠行為。利用事先規劃好的液滴陣列晶片，我們最多可同時量測7×5隻線蟲。相較於傳
統僅侷限於少數線蟲的量測方法，我們在此發展的技術所能達到的量測效率最多可提升35倍。藉由本
技術，我們希望最終提供長時間線蟲量測研究，如睡眠行為，一套快速有效的方法。 
 
2. 研究目的與文獻探討 
靜置(Lethargus)可被視為線蟲的一種睡眠行為。線蟲通常展現這種安靜的行為在每次成長的階段之
間。正如高等動物的睡眠，當線蟲進入靜置階段時，便會顯著地減弱活動範圍以及與外界互動的強度。
由於線蟲在生物界已是一種重要的動物模型，常用於如基因工程、神經工程、製藥等，因此研究線蟲
的靜置行為相信有助於解開睡眠的奧秘並促成未來睡眠障礙的治療。然而長期觀測線蟲行為本身在目
前仍具有相當的挑戰性。常用固定線蟲的方法如餵食麻醉劑1、設計特殊流道2等又往往不適用於睡眠
的研究，因為過程中可能會干擾線蟲的神經或身理系統。為此，Raizen等人3曾改用食物引誘的方式，
希望可以侷限其活動範圍，但是最終仍有不確定性高、成功率低的問題。 
 
為改善此不確定性並提升效率，我們透過近來逐漸受到矚目的液滴實驗室4的啟發，遂決定利用液滴來
侷限線蟲的活動範圍，同時避免外力過度干擾其行為。液滴在微流體領域已是公認除傳統連體流系統
外另一強大的生化實驗工具4-6。透過適當的設計，液滴幾乎可以成為自給自足，功能獨立的反應平台。
相較於需要流道的技術，液滴系統(1)不需要有形的微閥、微幫浦等微流元件，(2)節省人力、金錢與
時間，(3)避免交互汙染，(4)具備高通量與(5)僅需少量樣本，因此可以是微生物長時間量測的絕佳
利器。Brouzes等人7便曾利用油/水所形成的兩相流系統展示用液滴連續包覆單細胞的技術。實驗中，
細胞在液滴內也成功存活達到數十天之久。最近Shi等人8進一步利用兩相流技術連續包覆單一線蟲在
液滴內，成功率可達到60%。藉此，他們研究線蟲在一定時間內(120分鐘)內對毒性物質(MPP+)的反應。
然而由於流道結構極佔體積，因此該研究並無法同時量測大量線蟲。 
 
在我們所提出的研究方法中，我們僅須利用事先規劃好的靜態液滴晶片注入適量的液體(NGM)、食物
(E-coli)與線蟲，然後覆蓋礦物油防止揮發，即可形成一隔離的生存空間提供線蟲存活數日之久。由
於所用的晶片不涉及任何複雜結構，因此每個液滴槽(well)可以安排極靠近彼此以利用空間。在最佳
的情況下，我們可同時量測7×5=35隻線蟲，大幅提升量測效率。為量測線蟲的特殊睡眠行為，在此研
究中我們也同時開發一套簡易的影像分析技術。利用定間格拍攝的方式，擷取長時間的連續影像。藉
分析兩兩影像間的差異，可判斷線蟲的活動狀態。為方便量化線蟲的睡眠行為，我們定義三種統計參
數以區分不同的睡眠模式。在比較野生型(N2)與變異型(elg-4)在這三種參數的睡眠變化，我們發現
兩者確實存在明顯差異。而這種差異與在傳統洋菜膠上所觀測到的趨勢一致，可以間接證明利用本液
滴技術在線蟲長時間行為量測上的實用性。 
 
3. 研究方法 
3.1 實驗架設 
如圖1所示，液滴晶片是由一片 Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)表面散佈7x5個直徑1 mm圓形凹槽所形
 在此我們設定相機每隔十秒拍攝一張靜態影像，曝光時間希望維持在 0.05秒以下以避免模糊影像。由
於本研究分析線蟲睡眠期行為時僅需分辨動態與靜態兩種狀態，因此藉由兩張鄰近影像相消所得到的
差異，我們便可以簡易推斷線蟲當時的狀態(圖 2a)。一般來說當現蟲處於靜止狀態時，相消後若不考
慮背景雜訊則灰階影相強度將幾乎為零；相反地，若線蟲正處於活動狀態，則相消後將可在灰階強度
上得到與蟲體輪廓相符一正一負的影像。這時我們可以定義當相消後的影像灰階強度大於背景強度(可
由使用者設定)時，則其代表狀態為動態(0)，反之則為靜態(1)。據此原則接連分析所擷取影像，便可
獲得代表在記錄時間內線蟲行為的數位化數據。進一步，為求得靜止狀態下的強度多寡，可將數組數
據求取平均，所得的比率即為一定時間區塊內線蟲的靜態程度(圖 2b)。將比例與所經過的時間繪成曲
線圖即可代表量測時間內線蟲的行為狀態變化(圖 2c)。另外為剔除偽資訊或不完整資訊，我們定義僅
睡眠期發生於開始量測 30分鐘後或結束量測 30分鐘前才可被認定為有效數據。如前所敘，由孵化到
成蟲階段，秀麗隱桿線蟲會有四個主要的峰值對應到其四個睡眠期。這裡的影像分析由於無須複雜的
影像辨識過程，因此即便處理大量資料也不會曠日廢時。 
4. 結果與討論 
4.1 靜態液滴晶片長期與平行量測評估 
為確認線蟲能在晶片內正常生長與活動，我們首先對N2線蟲的生長情形進行評估。圖3a顯示在充滿液
體的凹槽內，線蟲仍能隨時間正常孵化由幼蟲轉變為成蟲。對照其睡眠行為(圖3b)可以清楚看到在不
同成長階段皆有相當明顯的睡眠高峰期，標示其不同階段的轉換時程。比較Raizen等人3先前的研究，
晶片內的線蟲除了高峰期外有較頻繁的小幅睡眠頻率，其餘與洋菜膠上的線蟲睡眠行為相當一致。而
這項結果也顯示本液滴晶片適合用以作為睡眠研究的平台。

陣列內的平行量測。(d)用以評估三項統計參數的睡眠曲線範例圖。 
 
同時間大量平行量測是液滴晶片另一項訴求的重點，因此只要影像擷取裝置可以容納得下，便可以持
續擴充可量測線蟲數量。在本研究中，我們最終可達到的數目，如圖3c所示，為7×5=35隻線蟲。在此，
我們鎖定L4轉變為成蟲的過程作為稍後統計參數之用，因此所有的線蟲皆經過同步處裡起始於L4階
物濃度對線蟲外在生理表現可能的衝擊。實驗中線蟲被餵以三種不同的食物濃度，分別為OD=0.03, 
0.15, 0.83。24小時後結果顯示高食物濃度(OD=0.83)的液滴，線蟲成長與正常情況下無異；反之線
蟲則成長速度緩慢且仍處於L4幼蟲階段(圖5a)。圖5b與5c顯示不同濃度下線蟲的體長與成長速率所存
在的明差異。低食物濃度(OD=0.03)同時也可能造成較高的致死率(圖5d)。綜合以上的量測結果可以
發現食物對於線蟲在封閉環境下相當重要。不足的食物除了可影響線蟲生長外同時也是造成線蟲提早
死亡的關鍵。

4.3 N2與egl-4(MT-1074)的睡眠行為比較 
根據此靜態液滴量測技術的目標，我們希望以有效率、簡易的方式建立不同基因變異線蟲的睡眠行為
模式。為初步驗證此目的，N2與egl-4兩種不同的線蟲被用在現今所發展的技術下進行量測與比較。
究人員一強而有力的工具。

actual and synthetic flow images (Westerweel et al. 2004;
Sud 2005; Wereley et al. 2005; Kahler et al. 2006). How-
ever, the reliability and accuracy of the SPE algorithm have
not yet been examined closely. Discrepancies have been
observed between analytic and experimental results,
showing that further study is needed.
According to the prior work (Keane and Adrian 1992;
Prasad et al. 1992; Fincham and Spedding 1997; Huang
et al. 1997; Westerweel 1997) on improving the conven-
tional spatial cross-correlation, several parameters such as
particle image diameter, interrogation window, and the like
were usually discussed. Fincham and Spedding (1997)
stated that errors occur as the interrogation window
shrinks. Moreover, an optimal range of particle image
diameter for a certain interrogation region was studied.
Prasad et al. (1992) and Westerweel et al. (1997) indicated
2–3 pixels would result in least variance of RMS error.
Particle image diameter and particle image density were
studied by Huang et al. (1997) in order to quantify and
reduce the errors of digital PIV. It showed that a low
particle concentration tends to cause a large mean bias
error, yet a modest particle image diameter can reduce the
error. Typically, the measurement errors are decomposed
into two forms, namely the bias error and the random error
(i.e., RMS error). Their influences on PIV and relevant
improvements have been well discussed by a number of
literatures (Huang et al. 1993, 1997; Fincham and Sped-
ding 1997; Weng et al. 2000; Gui and Wereley 2002;
Wereley et al. 2005).
In this study, a series of synthetic particle images
subject to a parabolic flow profile were generated from a
custom-written PIV package EDPIV. Five parameters,
particle image quality, particle image density, search
radius, particle image displacement, and particle image
diameter, were investigated. All of them were assessed
with measurement errors and their correlation coefficients
with defined background noise. The analyses suggest that
an ideal SPE computation (i.e., accurate and reliable) may
need the following conditions: (i) high particle image
density, (ii) big particle image diameter (i.e., appropriate
for sub-pixel accuracy), (iii) large search radius (i.e.,
sufficient to cover the required spatial information), (iv)
short displacement (when Brownian motion is not a
concern), and (v) high image quality. The SPE algorithm
was also evaluated under the conditions without back-
ground noise. The relationship between accuracy and
individual parameters was analyzed. All parameters show
substantial improvements on the random error, yet minor
or no effects on the bias error. Compared with FFT-CC
under the same SNR, the result of SPE performs better
without background noise but worse with background
noise. It implies more image pairs are needed in practice
when an equivalent SNR is expected. Eventually, the
analyses are contributed to the general criteria for further
SPE applications. Based on the completion of the above
work, the prediction of the experimentally minimal reso-
lution is 64.5 nm (i.e., de = 54.11 lm &9 pixels) while
the characteristic size of flow conduit is on the order of
submicron.
In order to verify the tendency obtained from the
simulations, experimental measurements in a straight
microchannel were implemented with a self-developed
micro-PIV system. The image sets met the rules were
compared with the normal ones without special process-
ing. Obvious differences were found, implying the SPE
evaluation is improved after applying the criteria.
Accordingly, plenty of time and disk space were saved
since the required image pairs for the least SNR were
effectively reduced. Due to the current hardware limita-
tions, however, the achievable ultimate resolution was
only 129 nm.
2 Theory and method
2.1 Single pixel evaluation (SPE)
As shown in Fig. 1a, the operation of spatially averaged
cross-correlation typically needs two multi-pixel interro-
gation windows to yield one valid displacement vector.
Ideally, when the second window contains all of the
information from the first one and no velocity gradient
occurs inside the region, a perfect correlation peak indi-
cating the true displacement can be obtained. The mathe-
matical expression for such a spatially averaged correlation
is written as
UCCðm; nÞ ¼
XP
x¼1
XQ
y¼1
f ðx; yÞ  gðx þ m; y þ nÞ ð1Þ
where P and Q denote the side lengths of interrogation
window in x and y directions, respectively. f and g are the
intensity functions of the first and the second windows. m
and n are the displacement in the correlation domain. The
parameters that alter the accuracy come from the particle
image density, image quality, and interrogation window
size. Obviously, enlarging the window size is a way to
ensure that sufficient spatial information is included.
However, a large interrogation region may result in a
serious bias error as well as reduction in spatial resolution.
To solve the problems, a novel algorithm named single
pixel evaluation (SPE) was proposed (Westerweel 1997) to
increase the spatial resolution without compromising the
SNR. The cross-correlation function from Eq. 1 can then be

The third term on the right-hand side in Eq. 5 is an
average of the random portion. Therefore, the net value of
ei can be effectively eliminated as long as the number N is
sufficiently large. It should be noted that the potential
deviation due to the strong velocity gradient near the
channel walls is excluded in this study. According to the
principle of SPE algorithm, the in-plane loss of pairs
theoretically does not exist (Kahler et al. 2006). The out-of-
plane loss of pairs can be examined from the perspective of
depth of correlation (DOC) (Bourdon et al. 2006).

where no is the immersion medium, dp is the particle
diameter, M is the magnification of objective lens, NA is
the numerical aperture of objective lens, k is the collected
wavelength, e is the threshold weighting function value
where particles are no longer considered to contribute to
the calculated velocity (normally taken as 0.01). Taking the
experimental conditions into consideration that M = 100,
NA = 1.4, dp = 100 nm, and k = 611 nm, the DOC is
estimated to be 1.17 lm. Since the DOC plane is very thin
as compared to the overall channel depth (37 lm) and there
is nearly no out-of-plane motion, the out-of-plane loss of
pairs can be ignored.
2.3 Synthetic particle images
A series of well-controlled synthetic particle images were
generated from a software package EDPIV (Education
Particle Image Velocimetry, http://www.edpiv.com) based
on the five parameters. The image size was 64 9 64 pixels.
In this article, a parabolic curve governs the flow behavior
in the entire simulations since most real channel flows are
pressure driven. To compare the simulations with the
experimental measurements, two cases with and without
background noise (BG) were studied. In which the case
contains background noise, the noise fluctuates about its
mean value (95) with a standard deviation (5). Unless
mentioned in the context particularly, the search radius is
fixed at 12 pixels, the particle image density is
9.77 9 10-3 #/pixel (40 particles in a 64 9 64 pixel area),
the maximal displacement of the flow profile is 5 pixels,
the peak intensity of particle randomly varies between 130
and 250 gray levels, and the particle image diameter dis-
tributes between 3 and 5 pixels. Since the recommended
number of particles in a conventional interrogation window
is 7–10 (Keane and Adrian 1992) and the chosen window
size is 32 9 32 pixels, the ideal particle density in a
64 9 64 simulation image is then equivalent to
4 9 10 = 40 particles. In Fig. 2, the actual region of
interest (red dash square) is smaller than the whole image
size due to the search radius (SR). That is, the near edge
areas are not evaluated in this study. Although a small
search radius allows the computation to approach the edge,
the appropriate search radius is determined by the maximal
displacement of the flow.
For the overall synthetic particle images, the individual
particle image is generated by a Gaussian intensity profile
(Gui and Seiner 2004)

2  ðy  y0Þ2
1=2ð Þd2e
" #
ð7Þ
where (x0, y0) is the center of the particle, I0 is the peak
intensity, de is the particle image diameter. Consequently,
de/2 defines the standard deviation of the Gaussian dis-
tribution. For simplicity, no thickness is considered in the
images. The out-of-plane effect and the potential inten-
sity distribution of the volume illumination do not
interfere with the scattering light from particles. Particles
with different image diameters are likely to have the
same peak intensity. The final synthetic images subject to
the particle image quality, particle density and particle
image diameter are demonstrated in Fig. 3. The simu-
lated values of each parameter were chosen depending on
personal experience and the characteristic values reported
on the literatures (Keane and Adrian 1992; Prasad et al.
1992; Fincham and Spedding 1997; Huang et al. 1997;
Westerweel 1997).
2.4 Determination of spatial resolution
The spatial resolution in the FFT-CC algorithm is deter-
mined by the first interrogation window size (Meinhart
et al. 1999). However, the interrogation window cannot be
too small in order to contain sufficient particles (7–10) to
avoid low SNR. Usually, a window of 32 9 32 pixels is a
common choice, yet a window smaller than 16 9 16 pixels
is rare. Considering the current evaluation algorithm, the
physical pixel size of the CCD camera becomes the major
limitation for the spatial resolution. By incorporating a
high magnification objective lens, the resolution projected
to the real world is likely to increase. Here, the minimal
spatial resolution of SPE is determined by a simple rela-
tionship between the magnified particle diameter d
_
p
 
and
the pixel size (Dp) of a CCD camera. The magnified par-
ticle diameter is a nominal size obtained from the actual
particle diameter multiplied by the magnification without
considering the diffraction effect. A simple rule of thumb
for the spatial resolution in SPE is defined as
52 Microfluid Nanofluid (2012) 13:49–64
123
different velocities adjacent to each other with a very sharp
boundary. The velocity distribution obtained from SPE can
approximate the ideal step profile as close as one pixel
(Westerweel et al. 2004; Chuang and Wereley 2007). As
long as the magnified particle diameter (no the diffraction
term) is not larger than the CCD pixel size and they have
no interactions with each other, different particle image
diameters do not alter the outcome (i.e., one pixel
resolution).
3 Assessment of SPE
3.1 Particle image quality (SNR)
For convenience, the particle image quality is quantified in
terms of decibel (dB). It is defined as 20log(Ip/Ib), wherein
Ip denotes the peak intensity of particles and Ib denotes the
mean intensity of background noise. In order to differen-
tiate the SNR of particle image from that in general signal
processing, the particle image quality is termed ‘‘image
SNR’’ in this study.
Five image qualities ranging from 1.34 to 47.96 dB
were compared with each other. As shown in Fig. 4a, the
bias error exists whatever the number of image pairs is
increased or the image SNR is high ([12.39 dB). However,
both improvements (i.e., averaging and thresholding) pro-
vide an environment without contamination from the ran-
dom error. A previously observed ‘‘peak-locking effect’’
(Sud 2005) is shown in this figure. The bias error exhibits
periodic fluctuations with respect to the particle displace-
ment. The exact cause of the half-pixel period is not yet
fully understood at present. However, some clues from the
past studies (Westerweel 1997; Chen and Katz 2005) imply
that the bias error is likely associated with the curve fit. The
mean peak amplitude of the bias error is approximately
0.02 pixels, which is much smaller than that of the random
error. The bias error becomes almost constant once the
random error term is eliminated (refer to Eq. 5). The results
of the mean random error að Þ and correlation coefficient
(R2) are shown in Fig. 4b. In a 1,024 image base, both a
and R2 tend to deviate from the estimated values as the
image SNR is below 12.39 dB. However, both are
improved as the number of image pairs is increased from
1,024 to 8,192. Although the poor image SNR seems to be
overcome by simply increasing the number of image pairs,
it is a good strategy to maintain the image SNR above the
threshold in case useful data are submerged in unexpected
noise. In some cases, non-uniform illumination for exam-
ple, increasing the number of image pairs has limited effect
on the accuracy improvement because the displacement
information is coupled with a complicated light intensity
distribution. To deal with this situation, additional pro-
cessing, such as spatial filtering, can be utilized to enhance
the image SNR prior to computation.
3.2 Particle image density (U)
As we know, both sparse and dense concentrations may
cause difficulties in resolving a correlation peak. An opti-
mal density is required in the SPE computation. Seven
densities varying from 10 to 400 particles in a 64 9 64
pixel image with and without background noise were
evaluated. In Fig. 5a, b, similar periodic fluctuations and
amplitudes due to the bias errors remain (shown in solid
lines) even though the random errors are alleviated. The
wavelength is estimated to be one pixel. Unlike the study
reported by Hung et al. (1997), different densities do not
contribute much to the improvement of the bias error. In
Fig. 5c, the optimal density without the noise is 160–200
particles (3.91 9 10-2 to 4.88 9 10-2 #/pixel) as consid-
ering the minimal a. R2 declines when the density is lower
than 20 particles or larger than 200 particles. This result
indicates an appropriate measurement error may compro-
mise between the particle image density (i.e., image SNR)
and the direction ambiguity (i.e., loss of successful pairing).
Less than 4.88 9 10-2 #/pixel, a higher density results in a
high image SNR yet low successful pairing; whereas the
loss of pairing takes over as the density is larger than
4.88 9 10-2 #/pixel. Under the noise condition, the

density helps eliminate the random error and increase the
correlation coefficient. However, the increase of density
should not obstruct the identification of individual parti-
cles; otherwise the uncertainty will escalate. As reported in
some prior studies (Willert CE 1991; Westerweel et al.
1997), a short displacement promotes the success rate of
paring. However, it should be noted that Brownian motion
is treated as a minor concern in both circumstances. A
reverse outcome will be expected when serious Brownian
motion becomes a problem.

displacement vector map of 3 9 3 grids was obtained.
Each spanwise position shown in Fig. 9a is an average of 6
data points. The corresponding SPE was evaluated with
8,192 image pairs with and without background noise,
respectively. With a search radius of 8 pixels, a better-fitted
profile was obtained. There are no data points near the
boundaries because of the search radius used. As shown in
Fig. 9a, the result of SPE with BG = 0 and 8-bit gray scale
reveals low random errors, low bias errors and a good
agreement with the theoretically parabolic displacement.
Especially, the total errors (see the error bars) are improved
as the number of image pairs is increased from 1,024 to
8,192. When a noise term (BG = 95) is considered, how-
ever, the result of SPE does not seem to improve as much
as the case without noise (Fig. 9b). The insignificant
improvement is because more image pairs are needed for
SPE to counteract the noise interference. In addition, FFT-
CC benefited by sufficient spatial information in a larger
area shows lower data fluctuations. These comparisons and
the previous image quality measurements indicate that SPE
algorithm appears to be more vulnerable to background
noise. In both cases, the inherent bias error makes FFT-CC
seriously deviate from the actual displacement (usually
smaller than the know values). The deviation is commonly
seen in a strong velocity gradient and consistent with our
prior knowledge.
4 Ultimate in-plane resolution
Obviously, the pixel size of CCD camera poses a phys-
ical barrier to this algorithm. By incorporating a high
magnification objective lens, however, the minimal res-
olution is likely to advance. Based on this principle, an
experimentally ultimate in-plane resolution of micro-PIV
down to 64.5 nm can be achieved when 60-nm particles
are resolved. A definite relationship between the magni-
fied particle diameter and the pixel size should be
clarified before the final resolution is determined (Eq. 8).
Here the magnified particle diameter is defined as an
actual particle diameter multiplied by a magnification
without considering the diffraction effect. For instance,
the magnified diameter of a 1-lm particle with an
M = 209 objective lens is 20 lm. As a result, in a case
that the magnified particle diameter is bigger than the
pixel size, the resolution is determined by the particle;
whereas the resolution is determined by the CCD pixel.
The tracer particles need to be carefully selected if a
resolution of 64.5 nm is desired. For simplicity, we
assume that the particles as massless points flowing
along the streamlines and no chemical reactions or
elastic collisions between them.
To demonstrate the great resolution improvement of
SPE over the conventional cross-correlation, a typical
curvature flow, i.e., four-roll mill flow (Wereley and Gui
2003), was used as an example. Based on the settings such
as the particle diameter (60 nm), concentration, and
intensity, PIV images were simulated with the desired flow
field. The maximal particle image displacement in the
image size of 256 9 256 pixels was 5 pixels. The mea-
surement area and the maximal velocity projected to the
real world were 15.36 9 15.36 lm2 and 0.3 lm/s,
respectively. The velocity vector maps derived from the
FFT-CC algorithm and the SPE algorithm are exhibited in
Fig. 10. The results show a fine resolution of 64.5 nm on
the right and a coarse resolution of 1.03 lm (16 9 16 pixel
interrogation window, 50% overlap) on the left.
Actually, more cares are needed as dealing with a real
flow. Some of them are discussed as follows:
4.1 Diffraction limit
Particle image diameter (de) is a parameter that compli-
cates the determination of resolution. It is a combinative
effect of a diffraction term (ds) and its geometric diameter
(dp). This nature makes a particle image diameter always

that are small enough to attain the desired spatial resolution
and follow the flow faithfully, yet are large enough to
dampen Brownian motion. As given in the previous liter-
ature (Santiago et al. 1998), the first order estimate of the
error due to Brownian motion relative to the displacement
in the x direction is written as

where D is Brownian diffusion coefficient, s2 is the random
mean square particle displacement associated with
Brownian motion, Dx is the characteristic particle dis-
placement, u is the characteristic velocity of the fluid, and
Dt is the time interval between images. In practice, the
error due to Brownian motion sets a lower limit on the
particle diameter. Suppose maintaining a maximal error,
eB = 0.1, the maximal displacement of 11.6 lm and min-
imal displacement of 0.64 lm, the smallest particle diam-
eter is estimated to be 50 nm. Under the blockage ratio of
1:10, the minimal channel size that can be conducted so far
is on the order of submicron.
Another issue regarding the scattering light intensity
emerges as decreasing the particle diameter. Since the
scattering light intensity is proportional to dp
6 (Foerter-
Barth and Teipel 2000), the loss of light intensity accel-
erates when tiny particles (dp  k) are used. Therefore,
keeping a discernible particle image, a compromise
between Brownian motion, light intensity and diffraction
limit should be carefully made prior to a measurement.
5 Microfluidic measurements
A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based straight micro-
channel with a dimension of 17 mm 9 61 lm 9 37 lm
was used to convey the pressure-driven flow. Two fluo-
rescent tracer particles, 1 and 3 lm, were, respectively,
seeded in the reservoir before they entered the channel. A
syringe pump (Model:55-2226, Harvard Apparatus) was
used to provide a withdrawal force at one end of the mi-
crochannel, thus the PDMS was bonded tightly with the
acrylic plate by the ambient atmospheric pressure. For
simplicity, the flow rate was fixed at 0.01 mL/min
throughout the entire experiment.
A self-developed lPIV system (Santiago et al. 1998;
Meinhart et al. 1999) was introduced to measure the
velocity field in the straight microchannel. In addition, the
measured plane was focused in the middle plane of
the channel. An objective lens of magnification M = 20 and
numerical aperture NA = 0.4 was used. The excited fluo-
rescent particle images were projected to the high sensitive
CCD camera (1,300 9 1,030 pixels, Dp = 6.45 lm, 12 bit,
Lavision) with a setting of twofold binning in length and in
width. The initial image quality was adjusted by varying the
time delay of each laser Q-switch, thus the subsequent
particle image contrast was enhanced or reduced. Two
particle volume fractions were tested in the experiment,
namely 0.019 and 0.057%. One was for a dense suspension
and another one was derived from diluting the first one with
more water. All the above parameters were eventually
employed in three measurement circumstances: (a) dp =
1 lm, 0.019%, (b) dp = 3 lm, 0.019%, (c) dp = 3 lm,
0.057%.
Although the flow rate was set at 0.01 mL/min, we
found the actual flow rate was usually slower than the set
value due to air gaps and slight leakage in the connections
or in the tubes. It increased the response time of the fluid
and interfered with the fidelity of the driving pressure. To
avoid potential unsteady problems, the measurements
began after the flow was completely stable. Depending on
the mean velocity, the Reynolds Number (Re) was 0.5,
which was in the regime of laminar flow. Figure 12
depicts the actual flow profiles in the mid-plane of the
straight microchannel. To test the previously observed
results from the synthetic particle images, three image sets,
(a) dp = 1 lm, 0.019% volume fraction, (b) dp = 3 lm,
0.019% volume fraction, (c) dp = 3 lm, 0.057% volume
fraction, were used. Here Fig. 13a shows the mean random
errors of the image sets prior to image processing. The
particle image quality was 8.87 dB. The search radiuses
were 9 pixels and 12 pixels while the maximal displace-
ment of the flow profile was around 5–6 pixels for all cases.
Both dp = 1 lm, 0.019% and dp = 3 lm, 0.019% exhibit
fairly poor results in eliminating a. Especially, case 1, case
2 and case 5 deviate from the analytic tendency seriously,

resolution of 129 nm was actually achieved due to the
weak fluorescent particle images. Other parameters such as
diffraction and Brownian motion that may potentially alter
the measurements are also discussed in this article. The
findings suggest a magnification not more than M = 1009
and a particle diameter of at least 50 nm to counteract
Brownian motion.
The SPE algorithm was also characterized by a series of
synthetic particle images in terms of five parameters,
namely particle image quality, particle image density,
search radius, particle image displacement, and particle
image diameter. Images of 64 9 64 pixels with their par-
ticle displacements subject to a parabolic flow profile were
used in the entire study. The results were analyzed based
on the measurement error and correlation coefficient. The
comparisons indicate that all parameters have significant
improvements on the random error, yet minor or no effects
on the bias error. With two image bases, 1,024 and 8,192
image pairs, the optimal values (lowest a and highest R2)
were derived individually from the measurements. In
principle, the bias error (b) is independent of most
parameters except for the particle image diameter. The
results show that it is a tiny quantity (*±0.02 pixels) with
a periodic behavior along the displacement direction. All
efforts that increase the image SNR effectively eliminate a
and enhance R2. The specific findings are described in the
following and their succinct remarks are listed in Table 1:
• An image SNR over 12.39 dB is suggested in order to
attain a  0.5 pixels and R2 = 1. Another alternative
can be achieved by increasing the number of image
pairs.
• The appropriate particle image density is between 3.91
#/pixel and 4.875 9 10-2 #/pixel) without background
noise. However, it shifts to a higher value when noise is
involved. Here the diffraction effect was not a concern
in the simulations since de is only 3–5 pixels. The
optimal value in reality should be more complex and a
density lower than the prediction is possible.
• The search radius (SR) must be longer than the
maximal displacement to collect the essential displace-
ment information. Typically, the minimal requirement
for the radius is the actual displacement plus 2–3 pixels
(i.e., SR C 7 pixels as the maximal displacement is 5

Abstract
Two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gas purge valves for excessive gas removal in general
lab-on-a-chip applications are presented in this paper. Both valves are devised based on a
three-layer configuration comprising a top layer for liquid channels, a membrane and a bottom
layer for gas channels. The pneumatic valves work as a normal gateway for fluids when the
membrane is bulged down (open state) by vacuum or pushed up (closed state) by pressure. In
the closed state, the air in front of a liquid can be removed through a small notch or a
permeable PDMS membrane by compressing the liquid. The purge valve with a small notch
across its valve seat, termed surface-tension (ST) valve, can be operated with pressure under
11.5 kPa. The liquid is mainly retained by the surface tension resulting from the hydrophobic
channel walls. In contrast, the purge valve with vacuum-filled grooves adjacent to a liquid
channel, termed gas-permeation (GP) valve, can be operated at pressure above 5.5 kPa. Based
on the principle of gas permeation, the excessive air can be slowly removed through the vent
grooves. Detailed evaluations of both valves in a pneumatically driven microfluidic chip were
conducted. Specifically, the purge valves enable users to remove gas and passively align
liquids at desired locations without using sensing devices or feedback circuits. Finally, a rapid
mixing reaction was successfully performed with the GP valves, showing their practicability as
incorporated in a microfluidic chip.

Introduction
Excessive gas removal in microchannels is of great interest
to lab-on-a-chip (LoC) applications, such as low mixing
efficiency [17], poor temperature uniformity in PCR [13], or
inhibitive reactions [8]. Because bubble formation is a typical
issue commonly taking place in microchannels, unprocessed
air bubbles or plugs may cause mass transport problems. As a
result, excessive gas removal is usually regarded as a priority
when dealing with microfluidic operations. With hydrophobic
microcapillary vents [7], Lee et al [11] showed nanoliter
metering, transportation, merging and biochemical reactions
on a microfluidic chip. Tiny liquid droplets were translated by
low air pressure (<3.5 kPa) generated from vents. Similarly,
residual air was removed through the vents. However, this
device is only eligible for some limited circumstances due to
the lack of physical valves. Another approach removing air
bubbles through gas permeable PDMS channels was reported
by Kang et al [9]. The concept relies on applying pressure
over air/liquid phase flow to squeeze the air out of the liquid
channel. The group successfully predicted the purge behavior
with a gas permeable model and a correction factor. Urbanski
et al [19] devised a latch valve to get rid of excessive mineral
oil in oil/water flow for metering. Similar work can also be

is related to the contact angle of liquid and the size of notch.
Usually a hydrophobic material, such as PDMS, accompanied
with a tiny channel can create a higher surface-tension force.
For instance, the theoretical threshold pressure in a PDMS
channel (θ c = 100◦) with two notches is 11.5 kPa. In theory, a
notch can be designed to withstand different threshold pressure
values by varying the cross-sectional area, yet a practical limit
may exist due to the potential PDMS membrane deformation
in the case of extremely shallow notches.
For the GP valve, air is squeezed to the grooves adjacent
to the liquid channel through the PDMS membrane. Due to
the porous nature of PDMS matrix, the elastomer allows gas
molecules to slowly migrate in and out of the material, yet
retains liquid inside the channel. In general, the permeation
can withstand large pressure but needs longer time to remove
gas compared with the ST valve. A model derived from
the gas-permeation equation [10] can be used to predict the
remaining permeation area as a function of time:
A(t) = WL0 exp
[
αP(p2 − p1)
db
T
273
76
Patm
t
]
, (2)
where α is an empirical correction factor, P is the permeation
of the material, p1 and p2 are the pressure values before and
after the PDMS matrix, b is the thickness of the membrane,
d is the depth of the channel, W is the channel width, L0 is
the initial length of the gas in the channel and t is the elapsed
time. Basically, the purging rate reduced exponentially and
varied with the pressure difference (p2 − p1), the thickness
of the membrane and the inherent material properties. The
process can be accelerated by increasing pressure difference
or reducing membrane thickness in the current setup.
The equation facilitates users to design a valve that can remove
gas in a reasonable timeframe.
In addition to the two dominant equations above, some
other forces might play minor roles in the purging actions.
For instance, the hydraulic resistance caused by the friction
between channel walls and liquid molecules is proportional to
the channel length and flow rate according to the Hagen–
Poiseuille equation. The driving pressure is progressively
depleted when a fluid travels a long distance or flows with
a high velocity. In the current setup, however, the pressure
loss is negligible (<100 Pa) compared with the driving
pressure. Moreover, the decrease in fluid velocity due to highly
compressed air in the last stage of the purging process in the
GP valve can further mitigate the pressure loss.
Gas removal by surface tension
Both the purge valves, unless mentioned otherwise, were
investigated in a closed state. A microchannel with input and
output reservoirs and the ST valve were fabricated as per the
previously described protocols. A water-based solution stained
with a food color (ESCO Foods Inc.) was employed here as
a working fluid and was placed in the input reservoir. The
output reservoir was connected to a vacuum pump (Thomas
Diaphragm Pump, 5002VD/1,0/N/DC) to create a driving
force for fluid movement. The pump was connected to a dc
power supply (Extech Instruments, 382260) and the pressure
difference was controlled by adjusting the dc voltage. The set
pressure values were observed to fluctuate between ± 0.2 kPa
due to the motorized diaphragm pump.
Figure 2 demonstrates one of the experimental results for
the double-notch ST valve. The leakage point was measured
by varying the fluid driving pressure and was observed to
reach a value around 12 ± 0.2 kPa, which is close to
the predicted threshold (11/5 kPa). It should be noted that
some other factors, such as hydraulic resistance and contact-
line pinning [4, 21], though minor in the current setup, may
alter the threshold if the boundary condition is changed.
Accordingly, the actual threshold may be higher than the
theoretical value. The influences of both effects on the current
thresholds are estimated to be less than 1%, respectively.
To deal with the contact-line pinning, a measured contact
angle should be used instead of a theoretical value. The
alignment was found to be fast compared to the GP valve.
The variation of the air/liquid interface velocity across
the valve seat over location (x) from the notch valve is
shown in figure 3 (see supplementary movie (available at
stacks.iop.org/JMM/22/085023/mmedia)). The start of the
notch is located at the origin (x = 0). Measurements upstream
of the notch (x < 0) as well as downstream of the notch (x >
0) were recorded. The interface velocity drops to zero rapidly
as the driving pressure is less than the threshold, whereas the
interface slows down in the notch but resumes velocity after
leaving the notch.
Gas removal by permeation
Quantification of gas removal in the GP valve was also
investigated. A series of experimental images showing the
operation are depicted as insets in figure 4. Unlike the ST
valve, excessive air is removed through the porous PDMS
matrix with higher pressure acting on the liquid. Although the

purging efficiencies in the upstream (∼9.28 mm away
from the purge valve) and downstream (next to the purge
valve) regions were measured (figure 5(B)). Upstream, the
liquid moved relatively fast (∼132.72 ± 39.69 μm s−1)
owing to abundant air as a cushion as well as a large
contact area in the microchannel. However, the air cushion
appeared to be unreliable, resulting in velocity fluctuations
in this region. In general, air is more compressible
initially and becomes less compressible after being highly
squeezed when the pumping rate is higher than the
purging rate. The porous PDMS walls are necessary
for promoting the purging process. However, this effect
decreases exponentially according to the permeation
equation (equation (2)). In the last stage, hydraulic
resistance depletes only some of the driving pressure
(<100 kPa). Also, the air compressibility and contact
area of channel walls play minor roles in the purging
process. The vent grooves therefore become the only exit
for the excessive air, resulting in a decline in the flow
velocity (figure 6(B)). This unique characteristic makes
the processing time escalate when an air/liquid interface
moves near the GP valve.
(iii) Pumping frequency. Changing the pumping frequency
is a major means for a peristaltic pump to vary flow
velocity. In principle, a higher pumping frequency results
in faster fluid flow. To characterize the relationship,
the velocities subjected to three frequencies, 0.5, 1 and
2 Hz, were measured. As shown in figures 5(C) and
6(C), no meaningful difference is observed between
the frequencies considering the rate of change of
displacement as well as velocity. All of the linear
correlation coefficients between any two cases are higher
than R2 = 99.4%, implying very similar trends. The
cause is attributed to the highly compressed air in the
last stage and the nature of the peristaltic pump. As
discussed in the previous sections, the flow velocity
declined on approaching the GP valve due to slow
permeation. The compressed air caused backpressure
when excessive pressure was accumulated in the channel
between the air/liquid interface and the valve seat. Since
the accumulated pressure was usually stronger than the
frequency change by the peristaltic pump, no significant
improvement in velocity was measured even though the
frequency was increased. The excessive pressure then
released back to the pump, decreasing the pumping
efficiency. This situation occurs in different phases
depending on different pumping sequences. However,
the phenomenon becomes negligible when the air/liquid
interface remains far away from the purge valve.
(iv) Length of the liquid plug. The last parameter shows the
influence resulting from the length of the liquid plug. A
liquid plug is essential when metering or quantification

complete mixing was achieved rapidly after the first cycle
without air bubbles or air gaps between plugs. A list of the
mixing efficiency from the beginning to the fourth cycle is
shown in table 1. The definition of the efficiency can be
referred to the prior literature [22]. The mixing efficiency
(mean ± standard deviation) is poor before the liquid plug
starts running loops. However, it swiftly exceeds 90% and
reduces uncertainty after the first cycle. The results confirm
that rapid mixing could be realized with the deployment of the
purge valves. Compared with other mixing strategies reported
in the literature [15, 16, 20], the mixing rate of the current
device at Re = 0.32 is 0.2. This mixing rate is very competitive
among the existing techniques. The rapid mixing capability
is obtained from breaking continuous flow into liquid plugs,
therefore sharing the same mechanism with the so-called
droplet mixing in the digital microfluidics.
Conclusion
Two types of unique gas purge valves eligible for two
distinct pressure ranges are presented in this study. The
proposed devices not only work as a gateway for normal flow
controls but also remove excessive air for liquid alignment
without active sensing elements. The ST valve can either
retain liquids with small pressure (<11.5 kPa) or slow down
fluid flow when the driving pressure exceeds the threshold.
The functional mechanism of the ST valve is the surface
tension induced by hydrophobic channel walls. The analytical
threshold is 11.5 kPa under the current setup. In contrast,
the mechanism that drives the GP valve is gas permeation
based on the porosity of PDMS. Finger-like grooves deployed
adjacent to a liquid channel are connected to vacuum to
remove excessive air. The employment of PDMS membrane
allows the GP valve to be operated with higher pressure

ABSTRACT 
Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans is an intriguing model animal. Often times, researchers may need to silence the 
squirming worms and brought them to various measurements. Here we present a method to rapidly silence the tiny 
animal by sublethal light-induced heat in a special microfluidic chip. The worm’s neural functions are temporarily 
shut down when a threshold temperature is reached. The neural functions can be resumed once the heat is removed. 
A safe operating range as to inducing heat knockdown was investigated. The finding showed that well-controlled 
heat knockdown is autonomous, reversible, and potential to worm immobilization.

INTRODUCTION 
Study of C. elegans grows rapidly in broad research fields due to its unique advantages, such as simplicity, fully 
sequenced genome, optical transparency, short life cycle, etc. Although the great progress in biology, little is 
achieved in engineering. In the cases that the worms need to be measured precisely or undergo a surgery, one can 
only constrain the worms by limited measures, such as microstructures [1] or paralysis with anesthetic [2], which 
may result in physical or neural damages. Prior research work showed that C. elegans is able to perceive and respond 
to a small temperature change (<0.1°C) [3]. Since C. elegans is a well thermo-regulated animal, temperature plays 
an important role in the worm’s physiological activity. To the present, prior studies have reported that the worm has 
several responses to different heat stimulations, including thermotaxis[4], heat avoidance[5], and heat shock 
responses[6]. However, a sublethal temperature, a.k.a. knockdown temperature (KT), has rarely received attention 
yet has been found able to prompt a widespread shutdown in the worm’s neural system. Even though under such a 
treatment, the worm’s cells and neurons remain intact. As a result, the worm can continue its life after the heat is 
removed. The short heat impact on the worms is hence regarded tentative, unharmful, and reversible.  
Considering that the knockdown temperature can silence C. elegans temporarily, we then developed an 
optoelectric microchip (aLINK, Fig. 1) using laser (20 mW, 640 nm) mediated heat to immobilize the worms. The 
microchip is composed of two indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass plates. One of which is coated with a photoconductive 
layer (a-Si). An aqueous droplet is sandwiched between an ITO glass plate and a photoconductive ITO plate. When 
the liquid is irradiated by a laser beam, the liquid medium (NGM buffer) will be heated by Joule heating as well as 
laser energy simultaneously. Consequently, the liquid temperature is increased and approaches the threshold (KT) in 
a very short time. An analysis as to the equivalent circuit of the system showed that the major temperature increase 
takes placed only within the irradiated spot. Compared to pure laser heating or electrical heating, aLINK enables 
rapid heating as well as addressable maneuverability. An adult worm immobilized by the technique was successfully 
used to demonstrate the removal of a fraction of lipofuscin granules utilizing femtosecond laser ablation.

laser beam (right). 
 
 
EXPERIMENT & RESULTS 
The experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 1. A continuous wave (CW) red laser (50 mW, 640 nm) was utilized 
spontaneously after more operating cycles (Fig. 2E). Our observation showed that most worms remained immobile 
for over two minutes after five cycles. Especially, the worm appeared to take longer time to recover with the laser 
only treatment. This is very likely attributed to a long accumulated time under a high temperature. In addition, our 
experiment indicated that over 50% of the overall worms remained active or responsive to the stimulation before 14 
cycles (Fig. 2F). Although the immobilization is reversible, the worm needs more recovery time after the on-off 
cycle increases. A over operation may cause permanent damages in neurons. For a safe operation, the maximum 
heating temperature should be less than 37°C and the continuous on-off cycle should be no more than three. For a 
practical demonstration, a laser ablation was successfully performed to remove the lipofuscin granule in a live worm 
immobilized by the proposed technique (Fig. 3).

CONCLUSION 
   This paper presents a technique using an innovatively optoelectric microchip to immobilize the nematode C. 
elegans. The immobilization is mainly due to heat knockdown, a sublethal temperature, created by a combinatory 
effect of laser irradiation and electric field. Several treatment conditions were conducted and compared. It was found 
that NGM buffer in an optoelectric microchip imposed irreversible, unharmful, and rapid immobilizing effect on the 
worm. The photoconductive layer enabled rapid heating to take place within the irradiation spot. As a result, 
addressable maneuvering can be achieved. The technique was actually applied to the surgical removal of lipofuscin 
granule in an aged adult worm accompanying with a femotosecond laser. The success of the treatment is believed 
beneficial to some applications that need non-contact C. elegans immobilization.
