ABSTRACT -  In this project, we primarily develop a hybrid multiple-model methodology for  
estimation, and then apply it  to tracking  problems. The  objective of the proposed scheme is to 
take the maximum advantage of the combined strengths of some  IMM-EV algorithms (which 
were introduced in our previous project NSC95-2218-E-033-006) so as to achieve better 
performance  and/or computational efficiency than the IMM and some  tracking algorithms. The 
advantage of the proposed approach has been verified using simulation results of some 
benchmark examples on maneuvering target tracking.

I.    INTRODUCTION   
         
     Effective approaches to target tracking in control guidance and navigation systems have 
been investigated by many researchers.   The interacting multiple-model (IMM) algorithm  has 
been a popular method for state estimation of discrete-time Markov jump linear systems.  In  
recent years,  possible  improvements to the IMM algorithm have been proposed, for instance,  a  
variable-structure multiple-model with likely-model set (VSMM-LMS)  algorithm  and some of 
the interacting multiple-model extended-Viterbi (IMM-EV) algorithms. In this project, we  
introduce a  new hybrid tracking approach based on  switching between two IMM-EV algorithms.    
The switched tracking approach is developed  specifically  based  on the IMM-EV(m=1) 
and the IMM-EV(m=n) where ‘m’ denotes the number of most probable model  paths at any 
given time step and  ‘n’ stands for  the number of  the overall model paths.  The proposed 
method exploits the combined strengths of those two IMM-EV algorithms  as  follows.  Since the 
IMM-EV(m=1) can efficiently identify and utilize the most likely model path (e.g., the quiescent 
model path) for state estimation, the proposed approach employs the IMM-EV(m=1) for tracking 
constant-velocity motions.  As  the IMM-EV(m=n) takes the weighted average of state estimates 
from the overall model paths, it generally yields superior performance in maneuver tracking.  
Thus the proposed method employs the IMM-EV(m=n) for tracking maneuvers.  Based on 
innovations and model probabilities from those two IMM-EV algorithms, we adapt schemes in 
[8] that detect whether there exists  target maneuver and whether target maneuver terminates if it 
exists.  Either of   those  two IMM-EV algorithms  is selected according to a switching rule based 
on the outputs of the resulting schemes.  Besides,  if  target maneuver is detected, then the 
estimation of the maneuver onset  time is carried out for enhancing the tracking performance 
though it may be impossible to determine the time exactly.  As the IMM-EV algorithms have a

III.    IMM-EV(m)   ESTIMATORS    
      The IMM-EV(m) algorithms developed in [3]-[4] 
are recursive estimators. The derivations  of the IMM-
EV(m) algorithms  are  based on  the incorporation of  
the mechanism of the extended Viterbi algorithm(m) 
introduced  in [3]  into  hypothesis reduction of the 
IMM algorithm. Given positive integers m and n with 
nm < ,  the  IMM-EV(m) algorithm  seeks   the ‘m’ 
most  probable  model  paths from  n  model paths  at  
any  given time  instant  based on  the extended Viterbi 
algorithm(m). Then it merges  the information from the 
‘m’ most  likely  model paths  into state estimation. The 
IMM-EV(m) algorithms are summarized  in  Table I  
and described below.  Given  n and  m  with nm ≤≤1 ,   
Step 1.  Mixing  probability calculation:  the  process  
involves in determining  the ‘m’  largest  elements of 
)(1 ip kij −µ  for ni ,...,2,1=   and  their  indices 
corresponding to  i   for a fixed index ,j nj ,...,2,1= .   
For  indices i  corresponding to the ‘m’ largest elements  
of  )(1 ip kij −µ ,  mixing  probabilities )|(1 jik−µ   are  
computed  by  only  taking  those ‘m’  largest  elements  
into account.  Step 2.  Interaction/mixing  of  the  
estimates:  the mixed state estimate  jkx

of the maneuvering motion  is  based on whether each 
acceleration component of the system simultaneously 
falls below its corresponding  threshold.  The   
termination  of a maneuvering motion is  declared  at  
time k~  if  kk >~  and k~ is the first time instant since  
time k  such that the estimated acceleration components  
in both coordinates, i.e., )~(ˆ kax and )
~
(ˆ kay , are 
insignificant (i.e., both |)~(ˆ| kax and |)
~
(ˆ| kay drop   
below  its  respective threshold,  say,  below 2%  of  the 
absolute value of its corresponding estimated 
acceleration component  at  time k ).   Of course, other 
choices of  threshold  settings are possible. 
       Accordingly, the propose algorithm is summarized  
in Table II.   
       Remark:  The quantities ,_,,,1 xaThguardTh α and  
yaTh _  are parameters whose values determine whether 
a switch between algorithms occurs. The quantity 
α−1
1  
with 10 << α  may be regarded as the effective window 
length over which the presence of a  motion change is 
tested. Under the Gaussian assumptions, )(kvε  is chi-
square distributed with zn (dimension of the 
measurement) degree-of-freedom which  in turn  yields 
)(kρ  approximately 
α
α
−
+
1
)1(zn  degree-of-freedom chi-
square distributed.  Thus, as long as the parameters  
α and zn  are  given,  we can set  the threshold 1Th , 
say,  the  95% confidence  region  for )(kρ . xaTh _ and 
yaTh _  are chosen as (15). It is to be noted that  there 
are some chances that a maneuver may  not be detected.

demonstrate  the feasibility of the proposed approach. 
The performance comparisons for each example are 
made based  on 100  Monte Carlo runs.

sporadically whereas the former outperforms or performs 
as well as the latter  for most of the time. Moreover, the 
ratio of the execution times of the IMM-EV(m=1), the 
proposed approach and the IMM is  1:1.68:1.49.

V.   CONCLUSIONS 
We have presented a tracking approach based switching 
among some IMM-EV algorithms. The proposed 
approach takes the  combined strengths of  the IMM-EV 
algorithms for achieving a satisfactory tradeoff between 
estimation performance and computational load.

ABSTRACT  –  In this paper, we propose a method of 
combining some interacting multiple model-extended 
Viterbi (IMM-EV) algorithms for target tracking.  The 
objective of the proposed scheme is to take the 
maximum advantage of the combined strengths of some 
IMM-EV algorithms so as to achieve better performance 
and/or computational efficiency than the IMM and some 
tracking algorithms.  Simulation results demonstrate the 
aforementioned goal can be achieved.   
  
I.   INTRODUCTION 
The interacting multiple-model (IMM) algorithm in [1] 
has been a popular method for state estimation of 
discrete-time Markov jump linear systems (MJLS). 
Recently, various fixed structure MM (FSMM) and 
variable structure MM (VSMM) algorithms  have been 
proposed as improvements to the IMM algorithm. The 
FSMM approach, e.g., [2]-[4],  utilizes the  total set  of   
models throughout MM estimation. In contrast, the 
VSMM approach, e.g., [5],  divides the total set of  
models into a number of model groups for state 
estimation, each of which represents a cluster of closely  
related  system  behavior  pattern.  In this paper, we will 
introduce a hybrid approach for developing a new 
alternative to the IMM algorithm, which  integrates the 
concept of variable structure into a family of IMM-EV 
algorithms in [3]-[4] for combining some strengths of 
FSMM and VSMM approaches. The hybrid approach is 
proposed specifically based on switching among some 
IMM-EV(m) algorithms.    
       It has been shown in [3]-[4] that given positive 
integers m and n with nm < , the IMM-EV(m) 
algorithms  can handle properly  the degradation of  the 
estimation performance and/or the increase of 
computational burden  due to the excessive competition 
from some unnecessary models of  the  n models. The 
IMM-EV algorithms span the continuum between the 
hard-decision methods of merged-hypothesis-tree style 
tracking algorithms and the IMM algorithm. The  IMM-
EV(m)  algorithm  computes and selects   the  ‘m’  most  
probable  model  paths from  ‘n’ (n  denotes  the

Taiwan  under  Grant  NSC 95-2221-E-033-041    
cardinality of the total set of models) model   paths at   
any  given  time  instant  based on  the extended Viterbi 
algorithm, and  merges  the information from the ‘m’ 
most  likely  model paths  into  state  estimation. The 
IMM-EV(m=1) algorithm is the most computationally 
efficient estimator in the family of IMM-EV(m) 
algorithms. However, it generally yields estimation 
errors larger than IMM-EV(m) algorithms with some 
small integers m>1, during the occurrence of a 
maneuver. To take maximum advantage of some 
strengths of IMM-EV(m) algorithms, it is more 
desirable that  the IMM-EV(m=1) algorithm is utilized 
for state estimation when the system  resides  in  or   
reverts  to a  quiescent mode whereas the IMM-EV(m) 
algorithms with some small integers m>1 are  employed 
when a maneuver is declared.  Accordingly,  switching 
among the IMM-EV(m) algorithms is performed  
whenever a  maneuver  is detected or  terminated.  In 
this manner,  the proposed approach  has a  high  
potential  for  achieving  a satisfactory tradeoff   
between estimation performance and  efficient 
computation  in comparison  with  the  IMM  algorithm.  
      This paper is organized as follows: Section II 
describes a Markov-transitioned multiple-model 
framework.  Section III  reviews the IMM-EV(m) 
algorithms. In Section IV,  we introduce the  proposed 
algorithm.  Section V demonstrates the feasibility  of the 
proposed approach in comparison with the IMM 
algorithm and the Viterbi tracking metho. We conclude  
this work  in section VI.  
 
II.    SYSTEM   MODEL 
        We  consider discrete-time MJLS.  Assume the 
overall system dynamics  can be covered by  n  discrete-
time linear models nMM "1 .  We denoted jkM  as the 
j th discrete-time model in effect at the k th sampling  
period  with  nj ,...,1= and ,...2,1,0=k . Moreover, each 
model  jkM   is  described  by  the  state  equation

.  In  Step 3,  a  bank of  Kalman  filters  are 
constructed  based  on the K  models given by (1)-(2). 
In  Step 4, model probabilities )( jkµ  based on  model 
likelihoods which are the measures of the model 
dynamics fitting the current channel dynamics are 
calculate.  In Step 5, the  process  involves in  
determining  the ‘m’  largest  elements of )( jkµ  for 
nj ,...,2,1=   and  their  corresponding  indices.   For  
indices j  corresponding to the ‘m’ largest elements  of  
)( jkµ , the m  largest model probabilities )(~ jkµ  are 
obtained  by  renormalizing the ‘m’ largest elements  of  
)( jkµ .   In Step 6,  the final state output is generated by 
the weighted sum  of  updated state  estimates jkxˆ  from 
Step 3 with  weighting coefficients  )(~ jkµ . 
 
IV.    PROPOSED  ALGORITHM 
        In  this  section,  we present the proposed  method. 
As shown in [3]-[4], the IMM-EV(m=1) algorithm  has  
the  fastest  execution  time  among  the IMM-EV(m) 
algorithms. As well, it may yield smaller estimation 
errors in comparison with other IMM-EV(m) algorithms 
with m>1 when the system is in a non-maneuvering 
mode. However, the IMM-EV(m=1) algorithm may 
yield larger  peak  errors than some IMM-EV(m) 
algorithms for small integers   m>1 during maneuvering 
dynamics. In addition,  its recovery rate may be slow 
after the system reverts to its non-maneuvering mode.  
To   combine   some  strengths of the  IMM-EV(m)   
algorithms,   it   is    suggested   that   the IMM-EV(m=1) 
algorithm be utilized for most of the  time to achieve  
efficient  computation but switch to employ some IMM-
EV(m) algorithms with some integers m, ‘ nm ≤≤2 ’ 
whenever a maneuvering motion is detected  and is 
persistent.  
        Specifically, the proposed approach employs  three 
sets of  algorithms: Set 1 is a singleton set  consisting of  
the  IMM-EV(m=1) algorithm. Set 2 and  Set 3  are  
pre-determined singleton sets,  each of which consists of 
an IMM-EV(m) algorithm with some integers ‘m’, 
nm ≤≤2 .  When  the system is initially in a quiescent 
mode, Set 1 is employed for state estimation.  When a 
maneuvering motion is detected, the operation is 
switched to Set 2 to modify data obtained by Set 1 for 
some time instants. Subsequently, the operation is 
switched to Set 3 to carry out state estimation. When the 
termination of the maneuvering motion is declared, the 
operation is switched to Set 1 and repeats the 
aforementioned operational cycle. As the IMM-EV(m)  
algorithms    have    a     similar    functional    structure,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig 1.  Schematic view of the proposed approach 
 
parameter passing between algorithms is 
straightforward and  simple.    
       Like the variable dimension filtering approach in 
[6],  the proposed approach  involves  in  predicting the 
onset  and the termination of a maneuvering motion as 
to determine switching between IMM-EV(m) 
algorithms.  To detect the onset of a maneuvering 
motion, we adapt the fading-memory detection strategy 
as follows. The fading-memory average of the 
innovations herein is based on the innovations of  the 
most likely model path  from the Step 3 of the IMM-
EV(m=1) algorithm. Suppose a maneuver is significant 
enough  to  be  detected at  time k .  In general, there is  
a delay  between the time of  an acceleration change and 
the time that the trajectory deviation is significant 
enough to determine that change unambiguously. A 
switch from Set 1 to Set 2 takes  place and  the 
maneuver  is  estimated to occur at time  1−∆−k  where  
∆  is the effective window length over which the 
presence of a  maneuvering motion  is tested.  Then Set 
2  is utilized  for  computing the state estimates from 
time  ∆−k   up  to time k so that  the  peak estimation  
errors caused by Set 1 during the occurrence of  a  
maneuver can be  reduced after  the data  processed  by  
the Set 2. However, appropriate state estimates and  
model probabilities  that  should  be utilized by the Set  
2  at  time ∆−k  are not  known a priori.  Thus, we 
activate and initialize the Set 2 using the data from some 
time prior to time ∆−k  obtained by  the Set  1.  And  
from then on up  to time k , we utilize the Set 2.  The  
computed  data at  time k  obtained by the Set 2  will be 
used for initializing the algorithm in the Set 3 at time 
1+k .  The Set 3  continues in real-time state estimation  
until  the termination of  the maneuver is declared.  
Assume the system dynamics is  described  in the x-y 
plane. Of course, the description can be extended to 3-
dimensions.    Our strategy for detecting the termination

      In the proposed procedure, let Set 2 and Set 3  be  
singleton sets consisting of the IMM-EV(m=2) 
algorithm. Let  α  be 2/3. Since 2=zn , )(kρ  is 
approximately 10 degree-of freedom chi-square 
distributed and thereby 3.181 =Th  due to 95% 
confidence region.   Let  the parameter guard  be 7.   
       The tracking performance measures of interest  are  
root-mean-square (rms)  x-y position errors  and  rms x-
y velocity errors.  Fig. 2 shows that the proposed 
approach  outperforms  the IMM algorithm during the 
10th-40th and 80th-100th sampling periods. The proposed 
approach yields slightly larger peak position errors than 
the IMM algorithm during the 45th-48th sampling 
periods while their position tracking performance can be 
considered comparable during the 40th-60th and 60th-80th 
sampling periods. Fig. 3 shows that the x-y velocity 
tracking performance of the proposed approach  
outperforms the IMM algorithm during the 10th-40th, 
40th-60th and 80th-100th  sampling periods while their 
performance is comparable during the 60th-80th 
sampling periods.  
      The ratio of the execution times of the IMM-
EV(m=1), the proposed approach and the IMM  
algorithm  is  1:1.29: 1.25.  Accordingly,  the   proposed
