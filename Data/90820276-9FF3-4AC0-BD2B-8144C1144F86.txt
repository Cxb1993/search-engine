的對象。此做法雖然能夠有效改善在緩衝器不足
的情形下必須丟棄Bundle的問題，但是在方法中
傳送端並無法確實知道到底總共能送出多少資料
量，在G-DTN網路資訊交換不明確的情況下，傳
送端若是傳送大量的資料，也是有可能耗盡所有
節點的緩衝器(包括協助接收端節點分散式儲存的
鄰近節點)。 
 
圖一 接收端分散式儲存流量控制 
因此本計畫提出一個傳送端主動進行分散式
儲存的方法，讓傳送端可以在資料傳送前確實知
道接收端節點與其鄰近節點所能提供之緩衝器容
量，根據資料的重要性選擇適當的路由以進行資
料的傳送，如此傳送端除了可以有效的控制流量
避免資料的遺失外，亦可以藉由適當的路徑安排
讓G-DTN網路的頻寬能夠有較高的利用率。 
要讓G-DTN節點知道其與四周鄰近節點間連
線之頻寬或是鄰近節點所能夠提供之緩衝器大小
等資訊，可以藉由 RIP (Routing Information 
Protocol)讓節點之間能傳遞彼此的資訊。RIP是一
個很簡單的Routing Protocol，是採用Distance 
Vector的方式，所謂Distance Vector是指以Router
的個數作為距離的判斷，而不是以實際連線的速
率。所以在某些時候所選的路徑是經過最少的
Router，但是並不一定速度最快。網路節點以RIP
作為路由協定在計算路由時並不會造成太大的負
擔，本計畫修改RIP協定使其收集One hop節點間
之路由資訊，如此節點在計算路由時的負擔將會
更小，更能吻合DTN網路特性上的需求。 
節點間之狀態訊息交換主要是以節點的代號
(ID)、節點可用緩衝器大小以及兩節點間資料傳
輸之頻寬為主，節點狀態訊息封包格式如圖二所
示。節點之間須不定期的交換狀態，當收到鄰近
節點傳送之狀態訊息後須建立「鄰近節點關聯紀
錄」。DTN節點根據「鄰近節點關聯紀錄」依照
緩衝器的大小與節點連線頻寬等相關資訊建立資
訊傳送時之優先順序，如此傳送端可以根據資料
的重要性選擇適當的鄰近節點進行Store-And-
Forward至接收端節點。 
圖二 狀態訊息封包格式 
DTN資料的傳送是以Hop by Hop方式傳遞，
因此傳送端傳遞資料的對象會是其鄰近節點，資
料傳送前傳送端必須先取得接收端節點所建立之
「鄰近節點關聯紀錄」，將取得之紀錄表與本身
之紀錄表核對，找出紀錄表中之「交集鄰近節
點」。傳送端根據接收端與「交集鄰近節點」之
緩衝器總容量便可以計算出目前DTN網路允許傳
送之總資料量，再根據資料之重要性依照傳送端
與其鄰近節點間路由的優先順序進行資料的傳
送，本方法之基本執行方式如下： 
l 節點間交換狀態資料，並建立「鄰近節點關聯
紀錄」。 
l 當傳送端準備傳送資料前，必須先取得接收端
的「鄰近節點關聯紀錄」，經比對後找出「交集
鄰近節點」 
l 統計出可以傳送之資料總量，避免因為傳送過
量的資料至DTN網路而造成緩衝器耗盡的情況。 
l 傳送端將權重最高之資料直接傳送至接收端，
若是還有資料需要傳送，則剩下的部分改採用藉
由鄰近節點以Store-And-Forward方式傳送至接收
端。 
l 資料以Store-And-Forward傳送時，傳送端根據
「交集鄰近節點」所計算之路由的優先順序依照
資料的權重選擇適當的路徑傳送至鄰近節點，鄰
近節點再適時的傳送至接收端。 
l 鄰近節點偵測到接收端節點已有充裕之緩衝區
時，便將傳送端寄放的資料傳送至接收端。圖三

called mobile station (MS). Each frame consists of 
downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) subframes. The DL carries 
information from a BS to SSs, while the UL carries 
information from the opposite direction (subscriber to base 
station).  
 
Figure 1. IEEE 802.16 network scenarios. 
 
 Downlink and uplink subframes are duplexed 
either using frequency division duplex (FDD) and time 
division duplex (TDD). FDD is suitable for bi-directional 
communication since it use different frequency bands for 
transmitting DL subframe and UL subframe at the same 
time domain. In TDD mode, the BS divides one channel for 
transmitting DL and UL subframes at two distinct time 
domain (Fig. 2). As a result of TDD allows the service 
provider to decide the ratio of uplink and downlink 
transmission times, and thus the flexibility of TDD mode 
allocated to serve the un-balanced traffic load is selected in 
this paper. 
 
 
Figure 2. IEEE 802.16 bandwidth allocation. 
 
 Two aspects of bandwidth allocation are flow 
scheduler and burst constructer (as shown in figure 2) [7]. 
The flow scheduler estimates the appropriate number of 
slots to each connection and then scheduling these 
connections according to their power saving policy, QoS 
requirements, DL/UL bandwidth ratio, and so on. The flow 
scheduling for OFDMA system has been investigated in the 
literature [13]. In burst construction, the burst for each 
connection must be constructed according to the burst 
structure, variation of channel quality, the number of the 
allocated slots, and other factors. 
One of the major functions and services performed by 
the physical layer (PHY) is modulation coding scheme 
(MCS) selecting rule in the data transmission and the data 
reception. While IEEE 802.16 supports several MCSs in this 
PHY, such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and 
several quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes. 
Thus QPSK and QAM will be considered the main focus of 
this paper. SSs at different locations may be allowed to use 
different MCSs, resulting in different resource allocations. If 
the bandwidth randomly assigned the channels to the SSs, 
they are unable to send a large amount of data resulting in 
decreased performance due to use poor subchannel quality. 
 The OFDMA frame for TDD shown in Fig. 3 begins 
with a downlink preamble which synchronizes each SS and 
performs channel estimation, and followed by frame control 
header (FCH) used to specify DL subframe prefix (DLFP) 
and the length of DL-MAP. The region which placed data 
rate in and formed by slots is called burst. Each user can be 
served with a different burst profile, which constitutes a set 
of transmission parameters (MCSs). The DL/UL-MAP 
messages describe the information elements that specify the 
burst profile for each DL/UL burst. On uplink, each SS uses 
the assigned burst allocated by BS to transmit its data 
through UL-MAP. On downlink, each SS determines when 
and where the data designated for it via DL-MAP.

2.2. Related Works 
Because burst allocation is NP-hard [7], there are some 
algorithms proposed to maximize throughput in Table 1. 
The paper [3] proposed Hungarian algorithm, which is a 
well-known combinatorial optimization algorithm for 
solving an assignment linear programming problem. The 
matrix is transformed to solve the problem with m 
connections and m subchannels. Each element in the matrix 
represents the channel information of one connection (such 
as RSSI, and SNR). The author modifies the original 
Hungarian algorithm to solve the flexible subchannel 
assignment that some connections can get more than one 
subchannels to transmit. However, it does not consider the 
requested bandwidth of each connection and has the 
problem of internal fragmentation. The connection with 
better channel condition might get more subchannels to 
transmit data, and each subchannel assigned only one 
connection. The over-allocation slots and over-allocation 
subchannels cannot be used by other burst. 
Positioning bursts can be viewed as a variation of bin 
or strip packing problem for minimizing power 
consumption of the SS [7-10]. The paper [7] allocates the 
bursts by minimizing the variance of sub-blocks on leftover 
space and by maximizing leftover area flexibility for the 
following bursts. In paper [8], the author proposed 
algorithms, which try to maximize throughput by 
minimizing internal fragmentation and by minimizing the 
leftover space. It maps downlink burst from right to left and 
bottom to top for retaining DL-Map space, and then find 
best suitable burst in unusual space. However, fully utilize 
the bandwidth resource not equal higher throughput since 
they all not consider the problem of subchannel diversity. 
The algorithm proposed in [9-10] is to reduce the number of 
bursts by grouping bursts with the same MCS but for 
different connections, so DL-MAP size is minimal. The 
adopted MCS of each connection is estimated in the flow 
scheduling for satisfying QoS requirement and power 
saving policy. This implies that each connection will adopt 
one MCS in different subchannels. The paper [9] even 
assumes there is only a slight different in carrier to noise 
ratio (CNR) between different subchannels for connections.

A downlink subframe is composed of X Y´
 
slots 
where X is the number of symbols and Y is the number of 
subchannels. Let a set of downlink connections as 
 L={C1,…,Cn} where n represents the number of downlink 
connections, and Ci represent the i-th connection after flow 
scheduling. iBWA  and iBWR  denote the number of 
allocated slots in the flow scheduling for Ci and the 
requested bandwidth for Ci, respectively. When flow 
scheduler estimates BWAi on the basis of the bandwidth BWRi requested by Ci, it also considers many other factors. 
The flow scheduler may do not allocate sufficient slots in 
the current downlink subframe, so the throughput provided 
by BWAi may be lower than BWRi. 
The size of DL-MAP formula is shown in Eq. (1) in 
chapter 2. The DL-MAP is allocated in the front of the 
downlink subframe in column-wise order and occupies the 
whole symbol. To ensure that all SSs can decode their 
embedded contents even under poor channel conditions, the 
DL-MAP is transmitted at the lowest data rate to provide 
robustness, i.e. QPSK1 2 . Fig. 8 shows four bursts and the 
DL-MAP size in downlink subframe and every burst 
contains only one connection identify (CID). Since the DL-
MAP must be a continuous bandwidth area and the shape of 
the area should be rectangular, it would have extra space for 
saving more information of bursts. Fig. 8 shows the size of 
DL-MAP occupied two symbols. However, it only used 
eight slots to save information of bursts and the unused slots 
in the DL-MAP is six slots. Therefore, there are more than 
four bursts could be constructed under this fixed DL-MAP 
size in the downlink subframe. By the Eq. (1) in chapter 2, 
the total number of bursts NoB  that the DL-MAP would 
provide in downlink subframe can be derived.

Figure 8. The DL-MAP is allocated in a continuous 
bandwidth area . 
 
 Since one connection can occupy multi-bursts to 
transmit data, let { }1 , ..., ki i iB B B=  be a set of downlink 
burst allocated for connection Ci, and jiB  denote the j-th 
burst of connection Ci. When allocating a burst, we need to 
consider the characteristic of subchannel diversity. Let a 
two-dimensional matrix, M, is represent adopted MCSs in 
different subchannels for each connection, and ( , )M i j  
denote the MCS used by Ci in the j-th subchannel. Let 
j
iMCS  and 
j
iS  denote the adopted MCS and the number 
of occupied slots by jiB  of Ci, respectively. Since a burst is 
a continuous area, it can be represented as the starting slot to 
the ending slot, a burst 1 1 2 2[( , ), ( , )]i
jB x y x y= , where 
1 1( , )x y  and 2 2( , )x y  represent the starting slot and the 
ending slot, respectively. The throughput jiTp  for 
connection Ci is computed by 
j j
i iS MCS´  that 
j
iB  can 
support, and the total throughput Tpi for connection Ci is 
computed by 1 .... ki iTp Tp+ + . Fig. 9 shows the case that 
2
1B  is allocated in the poor subchannel, so the throughput 
2
1Tp  of C1 is low. However, the throughput 
1
1Tp  of C1 is 
high since 11B  is allocated in good subchannel. 
Figure 9. Subchannel diversity. 
 
The throughput provided by BWAi may exceed BWRi 
since the burst is allocated in good quality subchannels. For 
any connection Ci, the number of occupied slots of each 
burst, 1 2... ki i iS S S+ + , is sufficient for providing the 
request bandwidth iBWR . The connection should be 
occupied 1 2... ki i iS S S+ +  rather than BWAi because unused 
slots internal to a burst are wasted. Fig. 10 shows that 
connection C2 is allocated 14 slots while it only uses 12 
slots to transmit its data ( 1 22 2 300Tp Tp+ = bytes) and the 
remaining 2 slots are wasted. Note, when Tpi exceeds 
required bandwidth BWRi, connection Ci only requires BWRi 
to transmit its data, the effective throughput is only BWRi.

: [( ,  ),  ( ,  )]ji m mB SSN m SSN S m= +  indicates the 
available area of burst jiB is from the staring slot (SSNm, m) 
to slot (SSNm+S, m) in subchannel m. Function Build( )jiB  
indicates the j-th burst allocated for connection Ci and 
marks all slots occupied by jiB . If the throughput of 
1 1,..., ni iB B

Ci, it revokes the latter subchannel, which has not 
constructed a burst for connection Ci yet. After finishing the 
first mapping process, if there are remaining NoB  and 
requested bandwidth, do Step 4 again.

Figure 11. The EHA algorithm. 
 
We present an example of EHA to construct bursts for 
connection C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 in a downlink subframe 
within 6 6´  slots, where the requested bandwidth are 
BWR1=100 bytes, BWR2=110 bytes, BWR3=90 bytes, 
 14 
construct the first burst 12B , and uses subchannel 3 to 
construct the second burst 22B . Thus, C2 transmits its 
complete data 110 bytes. Notably, C2 shrink occupied slots 
of 22B  when the requested bandwidth is satisfied. C3 is 
assigned to use subchannel 5 and the throughput for this 
burst is 96 bytes. However, the effective throughput for C3 
is 90 bytes. C4 is assigned to use subchannel 0 and shrink 
occupied slots of 14B . The throughput for this burst is 72 
bytes and transmits data for C4 completely. C5 is assigned to 
use subchannel 1. The throughput 15Tp  for C5 is 96 bytes, 
and remains BWR5=9 bytes and BWA5=1 slot. 
After first mapping procedure, there still remain 1 
burst (NoB=7-6) can be created and C5 remain BWR5=9 
bytes. Therefore, do step 4 for second mapping procedure. 
The unused slots in downlink subframe are subchannel 0 
and 3. The matrix M_Tp5 shows the throughput of C5 in 
each subchannel of unused slots. 
 
For transforming to the cost matrix, find the maximal 
throughput t=72 in the matrix and subtract each element by t. 
The cost matrix is shown in matrix M_Tp6. Find the 
minimum element in each row and subtract it from all 
elements in that row, and then find the minimum element in 
each column and subtract it from all elements in that column. 
Draw two lines to cover all zeros in the cost matrix. The 
optimal solution from M_Tp8 is that assigns subchannel 3 to 
C5. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12 (c) shows that C5 constructs the second 
burst 25B  in subchannel 3, and the throughput for this burst 
2
5B  is 72 bytes. However, C5 only remains 1 slot to 
construct the burst. Therefore, 25Tp  provides by 
2
5B  is 9 
bytes, and C5 transmits its data completely 
( 1 25 5 105 bytesTp Tp+ = ).

4   Simulation and Evaluation  
4.1  Simulation Mode 
The simulation scenario was an IEEE 802.16 OFDMA 
system with a 20MHz channel, which was comprised of 24 
OFDMA symbols and 60 subchannels in a downlink 
 16 
requested bandwidth. The reason is HA did not consider the 
characteristic of internal fragmentation. Figure 14 (b) shows 
that HA exists the internal fragmentation even when the 
requested bandwidth was heavy. The unused free slots could 
not be used by other bursts.

Figure 15 (a) illustrates the total throughputs of EHA, 
eOCSA, WLFF and HA in variation of the channel quality 
between subchannels. As the standard deviation of the SNR 
increased, the numbers of subchannels with good SNR 
increased, and the numbers of subchannels with poor SNR 
increased, too. EHA always constructed bursts in good-
quality channel and reserved unused slots for other bursts. 
The subchannels were allocated to the connection could 
redistribute to others if the connection did not use them. 
However, HA did not consider requested bandwidth of each 
connection. The connection with better channel condition 
might get more subchannels to transmit data. Figure 15 (b) 
shows that the internal fragmentation of HA increased when 
the standard deviation of the SNR increased. The connection 
may only require few subchannels to transmit data, but it 
was allocated too many subchannels that could not be used 
by other connections. 
 WLFF and eOCSA constructed bursts in the 
subchannels with worse SNRs as the standard deviation of 
the SNR increased since they did not consider subchannel 
diversity.

Conclusion 
From the proceeding simulation result, our proposed 
algorithm provides higher throughput than other algorithms. 
The proposed algorithm, EHA, gives each connection multi-
bursts to transmit data under the limit of DL-MAP size, and 
constructs bursts in good-quality channels. Compares to HA, 
EHA consider requested bandwidth of each connection, and 
shrink bursts by reducing the number of occupied slots for 
considering internal fragmentation. 
In future research, we will focus on grouping bursts 
with the same MCS in order to minimize the DL-MAP 
overhead and consider subchannel diversity. In terms of 
maximizing throughput, the bandwidth would have more 
data region to construct bursts by reducing the DL-MAP 
size.
