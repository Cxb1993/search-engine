te Lethe perovskite phase, which surely affects their properties. Compar-
ing with powders prepared from conventional solid-state reaction
from starting materials of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3, impurity phases are
never completely eliminated in the same temperature range. There-
fore, the coprecipitated powder calcined at 500°C is very prominent
for preparing single-phased BiFeO3 ceramics. Samples of these
three compositions can easily be sintered to about 90% theoretical
density at 750°C and higher than 95% at 850°C. Because the ce-
ramics sintered at 850°C possess the highest densities, electric and
magnetic properties of ceramics are reported based on samples sin-
tered at this temperature.
Figure 2 shows the dielectric properties of the three compositions
sintered at 850°C as a function of frequency. The dissipation factor
tan  of BFO ceramic exhibits a peak at 2–3 MHz, while those of
BLFO and BPFO decrease monotonically with frequency. The dis-
sipation factor of the Pr-modified BFO ceramic is very low in the
whole frequency range. The variation of dielectric constant with
frequency can be interpreted by space-charge polarization.17 The
peak of the dissipation factor of BFO occurs at 2–3 MHz, which
corresponds to the frequency region where dielectric constant
changes rapidly. In contrast, those of BLFO and BPFO ceramics
reveal little change because there is no peak in the frequency range.
The intrinsic dielectric constants, which are closer to the dielectric
constants measured at high frequencies, of the three ceramics can be
obtained from impedance analysis. They are 49, 120, and 92, respec-
tively, for BFO, BLFO, and BPFO ceramics. Modification of BFO
by La and Pr increases the intrinsic dielectric constants of BiFeO3
ceramics. The increase may be partially caused by the change of
crystal symmetry from rhombohedral to tetragonal.
Figure 3 exhibits the current density-electric field J-E curves of
the three ceramics, demonstrating that modification by La and Pr
reduces the resistivities of BiFeO3 ceramics. Although the leakage
current of BLFO at very low field is lower than that of BFO, it
increases over that of BFO quickly. It is interesting to note that the
space-charge polarization mentioned above occurs in the ceramic

deserve further investigations. The resistivities calculated at
0.8 kV/cm equal 6.2  109, 2.1  109, and 7.3  108  cm, re-
spectively, for BFO, BLFO, and BPFO ceramics sintered at 850°C.
These values are relatively high, corresponding to those reported in
BFO films which resulted in excellent polarization-electric field
P-E loops. The applied electric field of J-E measurement in this
study is low because of large sample size. Therefore, it is reasonable
to observe that BFO exhibits the typical ohmic conduction behavior
slope = 1 during the whole measurement range 0–1 kV/cm. The
non-ohmic conduction behavior of BLFO and BPFO in Fig. 3 indi-
cates that substitution of La and Pr complicate the conduction be-
havior. The leakage curve of BLFO and BPFO seems to display the
feature of grain-boundary-limited conduction behavior slope 1;
however, further research is necessary.
Figure 4 displays P-E loops of the three ceramics. The highest
voltage that can be supplied by the employed RT66A ferroelectric
tester Radiant Technology is 20 V, which corresponds to about
2 kV/cm electric field on the sintered ceramics. This electric field is
much lower than the coercive field reported for BFO films, which is
200–400 kV/cm. Therefore, the obtained polarizations are small.
However, it demonstrates that La enhances, while Pr depresses, the
P-E loops of BFO ceramics. The P-E loops are measurable if the
applied voltage is large enough. The obtained remnant polarization
is comparable with those reported elsewhere for BiFeO3 ceramics.15
Figure 5 shows the magnetization-magnetic field M-H curves
of these ceramics, revealing that both BLFO and BPFO ceramics
possess weak ferromagnetic properties. This phenomenon can be
attributed to the change of crystal structure and the ferromagnetic
property of PrFeO3. The XRD results in Fig. 1 show that the lattice
of BLFO and BPFO are tetragonal structures with higher symmetry.
For highly anisotropic magnetic property of rhombohedral BFO, the
change of crystal structure from rhombohedral to tetragonal causes
the magnetic dipole to move more easily and increases the macro-

Dense single-phase BiFeO3 BFO ferroelectric ceramics, with a resistivity of 10−12  cm, may
be formed by sintering the 450 °C-calcined coprecipitated powder at 800–850 °C. The ceramics
sintered at 750 °C contain a second phase of Bi2O3. The conduction loss activation energies at room
temperatures of 290 and 350–430 °C are 0.126 and 1.26 eV, respectively. The ac conductivity
thermal variation suggests 290 °C as the application limit for BFO ceramics. The loss at T
350 °C is higher for low frequencies than for high frequencies. In contrast, an opposite effect is
found at T350 °C. © 2007 American Institute of Physics. DOI: 10.1063/1.2798256
Perovskite BiFeO3 BFO is a material possessing
coupled electric and magnetic orderings that results in elec-
tromagnetic properties.1–3 BFO is also ferroelectric TC
=863 °C and antiferromagnetic TN=397 °C.4 It exhibits
weak magnetism at room temperature due to a residual mag-
netic moment caused by canting spin magnetic structure.5
These materials have potential applications not only in mag-
netic and ferroelectric devices but also in devices with
coupled electric and magnetic polarizations. However, prob-
lem of low resistivity has hindered its application. The hys-
teresis loops could only be observed at 80 K from a single
crystal with a spontaneous polarization of 3.5 C/cm2 in the
100 direction, but the saturation of the loop was not ob-
served even at fields up to 55 kV/cm.6 The lattice structure
of BFO crystal is a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite with
unit cell parameters a=0.5634 nm and =59.348°.7
Recently, observation of saturated ferroelectric hyster-
esis loops in BFO films has been reported.8,9 As for BFO
ceramics, synthesis of BFO usually results in second phases
such as Bi2O3 and Bi2Fe4O9, which appear if temperatures
are not controlled accurately.10 Recent work has focused on
solid solution of BFO with other ABO3 perovskite materials,
which prevent the formation of second phases and increase
the resistivity of the ceramics.11,12 However, direct study of
pure BFO is difficult. Other works on BFO ceramics in-
volved synthesizing pure BFO phase by leaching the impu-
rity phase with dilute nitric acid but the saturated loop was
not obtained in this pure BFO ceramic due to its low resis-
tivity and low density.13 It is a challenge to fabricate high
resistivity and high density BFO ceramics for investigation
of their properties and applications. Using coprecipitation
powder, we are able to synthesize pure BFO ceramics with
high density and high resistivity. In this letter, we report
electric properties of dense, pure undoped-BFO ceramics.
The bismuth nitrate BiNO33 and iron nitrate
FeNO33 with 1:1 ratio were dissolved in 2N HNO3 at
70 °C to form a 0.25M solution. After complete dissolution,
the precursor solution was mixed for another 1 h for homog-
enization. The precursor solution was first cooled to room
temperature before it was slowly dripped to a NH4OH solu-
tion with pH=9.5 to coprecipitate the powders. The NH4OH
solution was kept at pH=9.5 by slowly adding extra NH4OH
solution during the coprecipitation procedure. When the re-
action was complete, the coprecipitated powder was filtered
and washed with de-ionized water three times, followed by
washing with 99.5% ethyl alcohol, and filtered twice. The
washed powders were dried with an infrared lamp and then
calcined at 450 °C for 2 h. The powders were ball milled in
plastic jars for 24 h with 2.0% polyvinylbutyral binder, fol-
lowed by drying, grinding, and forcing to pass No. 120 sieve
for granulation. The granulated powders were then dry
pressed to form green pellets. They were baked at 350 °C for
0.5 h and 550 °C for 1 h to remove binders, and then sin-
tered at various temperatures in the range of 750–850° C for
3 h. During sintering, samples were sealed by an Al2O3 cru-
cible filled with powders of the same composition to prevent
the vaporization loss of Bi.

low temperature region, ac is relatively small and increases
slowly with temperature. In contrast, ac increases rapidly
with temperature when it is higher than about 290 °C. The
activation energies of these two regions are calculated to be
0.126 and 1.26 eV, respectively. The rapid increase of ac
with temperature sets a limit for the application of this ce-
ramic. At temperatures lower than 350 °C, the loss is higher
for low frequency than for high frequency. In contrast, when
the temperature is higher than 350 °C, the opposite is true.
The conduction mechanism for the low temperature region is
possibly due to short range charge jumping which has
smaller energy barriers, while the mechanism for the high
temperature region is long range charge conduction which
has to overcome relatively high energy barriers.

Dielectric and magnetic properties of multiferroic BiFeO3 -CoFe2O4 
nano-composites

Abstract: 
Spinel-perovskite nano-composites of xBiFeO3(BFO)-(1-x)CoFe2O4(CFO) 
(x=0.9, 0.7, 0.5) were synthesized by co-precipitated powders.  The composites 
consisted of pure spinel (CFO) and perovskite (BFO) phases without other impurity 
phase.  The composites possess low Hc(300Oe), and large saturation magnetization 
of 30, 100, 200(emu/cm3),respectively, for x=0.9,0.7, and 0.5.  The dielectric 
properties of xBFO-(1-x)CFO indicate the existence of space-charge polarization in 
the low frequency region.  The space-charge polarization becomes more pronounced 
when more CFO are incorporated.    
Keywords: ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, composite, nanostructure.

self-assembled composite thin film of CFO-Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) that exhibited good 
magnetic properties.9  Spinel CFO (a= 8.38A) exhibits a 4-fold magnetic anisotropy 
with the easy axis along <001> and a saturation magnetization of 350 emu/cm3.10  
BiFeO3 (BFO) possesses a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure and shows 
strong polarization and piezoelectric response.  BFO-CFO composites are 
perovskite-spinel composites like CFO-PZT. The difference is that BFO itself is a ME 
material. The BFO-CFO composites are interesting and deserve more investigation. 
The BFO-CFO composites were reported by Liu et. al.,11 however, only magnetic 
properties were mentioned.  In this study, we report the fabrication and properties of 
xBFO-(1-x) CFO composites.  Chemical solution methods were used to fabricate 
nano-sized powders for preparing nano-composites.  
Experimental Procedure: 
Ceramic composites of xBFO-(1-x)CFO with x = 1, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5 (in volume) 
were prepared.  The procedure of synthesis of bismuth ferrite powder is described as 
follows.  Bi(NO3)3 and Fe(NO3)3 were dissolved in 2N nitric acids, and then mixed 
together in a beaker to form 0.25M solution.  The mixed solution was slowly dripped 
to ammonia solution with pH=9.5 to co-precipitate powders in the beaker.  After the 
reaction was completed, the co-precipitated powder was filtered, washed with 
de-ionized water three times, and followed by washing with 99.5% ethyl alcohol and 
 5
polished, and electroded by silver paint.  Dielectric measurements in the frequency 
range of 10k~2M Hz were performed with an impedance analyzer (HP 4192A LF 
Impedance analyzer).  Current density vs. applied electric field in the voltage range 
of 0~1000V were measured with a high-voltage source unit (Keithley 237).  
Magnetic hysteresis was measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) (Lake 
Shore Model 7300) at room temperature. 
Results and discussion: 
Figure1 shows the XRD patterns of the BFO powder calcined at 550oC for 2 h 
and the CFO powders calcined at 500oC for 2h , indicating that BFO and CFO 
powders are perovskite and spinel structures, respectively, without significant second 
phases detected.  It demonstrates that the powders are very uniform so that pure 
perovskite and spinel phases crystallize at low temperatures.  According to the width 
of diffraction peaks, the crystallite sizes are estimated as about 20 nm and 10 nm, 
respectively, for calcined BFO and CFO powders.   
Figure 2 displays the XRD patterns of the 0.5BFO-0.5CFO samples sintered at 
780oC, 820oC, and 860oC for 3h.  The results reveal that the composites contain 
perovskite and spinel phases in the sintered samples.  If observing carefully, some 
second phases can be found in the 780oC sample.  The second phase is identified as 
Bi2Fe4O9.   When the annealing temperature increases, the intensity of the peaks of 
 7
composites of smaller x.  Space charge polarization takes effect only when the 
frequency of electric field is low enough that the charge carrier can move to the 
boundary before the field reverses.  Because space-charges can not follow the fast 
variation of the electric field in the high frequency region, the contribution to the 
relative dielectric constant is small.  Therefore the relative dielectric constants of 
these composites are close to that of BFO phase.   
Figure 6 shows the variation of current density with applied electric field 
characteristics of the composites, demonstrating that the current density increases 
with increasing amount of CFO.  The current density increases by about 3~4 orders 
of magnitude for the composite x=0.9, i.e. 10 volume% CFO, as comparing with the 
pure BFO.  The increasing rate of current density slows down when the amount of 
CFO increases further.  The CFO phase is the phase of lower resistivity, therefore, 
the resistivity decreases with increasing amount of CFO.   
The magnetic properties of xBFO-(1-x)CFO composites were investigated at 
room temperature using a VSM with an applied magnetic field of -10 kOe≦ H ≦10 
kOe.  Figure 7 shows the isothermal magnetic field dependence of the magnetization 
of the spinel-perovskite composites.  The samples exhibit hysteresis loop typical of 
ferromagnetic behaviors, indicating that the ordered magnetic structure exists in the 
mixed spinel–perovskite composites.  The composites sintered at 860oC exhibit

APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 88, 242909 2006ties. It limits the application of the BFO materials. The rela-
tively large leakage current density of BFO film is usually
attributed to the variable oxidation state of iron ions Fe3+ to
Fe2+,18 which are resulted from charge compensation of
oxygen vacancies. The coexistence of Fe3+ and Fe2+ pro-
duces electron hopping which increases leakage current. Ac-
cording to defect chemistry theory, charge compensation via
aliovalent-ion doping affects the oxidation state of iron and
the concentration of oxygen vacancies, which further influ-
ences the leakage behaviors of BFO films. Qi et al. reported
the effects of Ni2+- and Ti4+-doped BFO films on conduction
mechanism using PLD technique.19 The experimental results
indicated the great influence of dopants and identified two
kinds of leakage mechanisms.
After our preliminary study, low leakage current BFO
films fabricated by CSD method were obtained. In order to
further identify the conduction mechanism of CSD-derived
BFO films, different substitutive ions were added. In this

Multiferroic BiFeO3 BFO has been discovered since
the 1960s.1 However, material characteristics and physical
properties of BiFeO3 are still controversial. During the past
few years, progress on thin film growth techniques, such as
pulse laser deposition PLD,2–8 metal-organic chemical va-
por deposition9 MOCVD, and chemical solution deposition
CSD,10–13 provided new data for the understanding of
physical properties of BFO thin films. Recently, multiferroic
BFO has attracted enormous attention due to its potential
applications in advanced magnetoelectric devices and ferro-
electric random access memories. BFO has a distorted per-
ovskite structure with rhombohedral symmetry which be-
longs to the R3c space group.14,15 The distinctive feature of
BFO is the simultaneous existence of ferroelectric order
TC=1123 K and antiferromagnetic order TN=643 K at
room temperature.16,17

electric properties of BFO films.
Mn-doped, Nb-doped, and pure BFO films were fabri-
cated using CSD process via carboxylate precursor system.
Bismuth acetate, iron acetylacetonate, manganese acetate,
and niobium ethoxide were used as starting materials. Propi-
onic acid was chosen as the solvent and 2-methoxyethanol
was chosen as an additive to adjust the solution viscosity.
5 mole % of excesses bismuth acetate was used to compen-
sate the Bi loss during high temperature annealing. Precursor

tails of processes on precursor synthesis and film preparation
had been described elsewhere.20 The final thickness of films
after annealing was about 200 nm. Pt top electrodes with
100 m diameter were deposited on BFO films by rf sput-
tering to obtain the metal-insulator-metal MIM structures.

According to defect chemistry, substitution of ions with
higher valence for Fe3+ ions in BFO films is expected either
to eliminate oxygen vacancies or to increase the conversion
of Fe3+ to Fe2+.19 In this study no Fe2+ signals were found in
the x-ray photoemission spectroscopy XPS analysis. It is
reasonable to conclude that doping of Nb5+ decreases the
concentration of oxygen vacancies, which is able to decrease
leakage currents. In addition, doping of Nb decreases the
grain size of perovskite so significantly that leakage occurs
through grain boundary paths. The Nb-doped BFO films an-
nealed at 500 °C demonstrated lowest dielectric loss among
all BFO films and exhibited grain boundary limited conduc-
tion behavior due to the significant decrease of oxygen va-
cancies and grain size.
On the other hand, doping of Mn3+0.072 nm, which
has the same valence and similar ionic size to
Fe+30.069 nm, is not expected to influence the concentra-
tion of point defects in BFO films. The electrical properties
of Mn-doped BFO films, which exhibit high-loss Ohmic con-
duction behavior and high dielectric loss at low frequency
region, demonstrate that other changes take place. The XPS
analysis of the Mn-doped BFO films was performed to de-
termine the valence of Mn ions. The Mn 2p3/2 peak of the
Mn-doped BFO films locates at round 641.45 eV, with a
weak shoulder at 640 eV. The 2p3/2 peaks of Mn2+, Mn3+,
and Mn4+ ions in oxides are located at 641.0, 641.5 and
641.7 eV, respectively. According to the XPS results, the Mn
ions in the Mn-doped BFO films are mainly Mn3+. Some Mn
ions may appear as Mn+20.081 nm, which is able to occupy
the site of Fe3+. The existence of Mn2+ increases the concen-
tration of oxygen vacancies, explaining the increase of leak-
age currents and dielectric loss with the addition of Mn
dopants.
The ferroelectric characteristics of pure and Nb-doped
BFO films annealed at 500 °C were shown in Fig. 6. No
polarization–electric-field P-E curve could be obtained in
the Mn-doped BFO films due to their poor leakage behav-
iors. The pure BFO film showed high saturated Ps and
remnant polarizations Pr of 100 and 28 m/cm2, respec-
tively. The P-E hysteresis loop of the pure BFO film in Fig.
6 shows a clear sign of saturation and has a quite different
shape from what have been reported previously, e.g., Wang
et al.2 and Yun et al.6 It shows a much smaller coercive field
and a reduced remnant polarization. This is probably due to
the orientation and the lattice symmetry of the perovskite
grains in the pure BFO films. The BFO films reported by

242909-3 Chung, Lin, and WuWang et al.2 were 001 epitaxial, while those reported by

pared at low temperature by the CSD method. Compared
with those reported in literature, the polarization values are
very good. The P-E loop was actually not closed because the
applied field for P-E measurement was very high, up to
450 kV/cm and the frequency was 1 kHz. The leakage cur-
rent of pure BFO films increases rapidly when the applied
filed is higher than 100 kV/cm. The Nb-doped BFO film
displayed better ferroelectricity than the pure one, but higher
voltages were required to obtain saturated P-E curves. The
larger P-E curves of Nb-doped BFO films were consistent
with the decrease of the concentration of oxygen vacancies
according to defect chemistry.
In conclusion, Mn-doped, Nb-doped, and pure BFO
films were fabricated by chemical solution deposition
method. The XRD analysis and SEM observation showed
that all BFO films possessed pure perovskite phase with
dense and smooth surfaces. Nb and Mn dpoants decreased
the grain sizes of BFO films. Electric properties measure-
ment illustrated remarkable difference in leakage behaviors
of doped BFO films. The Mn dopant was harmful to electric
properties of BFO films, while the Nb dopant was effective
in improving those of BFO films. The J-E curves indicated
that conduction mechanisms of Mn-doped, Nb-doped, and
pure BFO films annealed at 500 °C were Ohmic, grain-
boundary limited, and space-charge limited conductions, re-
spectively. Defect chemistry and chemical reaction during
CSD process were able to explain the electric properties
caused by Mn and Nb dopants.

morphology was characterized by atomic force microscopy
Digital Institute 3100. The compositional depth profile of
the films was investigated by Cameca IMS-4f secondary ion
mass spectrometer SIMS with a primary ion beam of O2+
operated at 12.5 kV.
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of BFO films depos-
ited on a BPO/Ru and b BPO/Pt/Ru. The BPO films
deposited on 002-oriented Ru and 111-oriented
Pt/Ru002 exhibit 110- and 111-preferred orientations,
respectively. The BPO electrode deposited on 002-oriented
Ru exhibits 110-preferred orientation. The BFO film depos-
ited on the 110-oriented BPO/Ru displays the same 110-
preferred orientation, indicating that BFO grows easily on
templates of 110-oriented BPO films. During BPO deposi-
tion, the surface of the Ru inevitably formed oxidized Ru
RuO2 due to the application of an atmosphere with argon
and oxygen. However, the RuO2 may be too thin to detect in
our sample. The RuO2 always show 110 orientation with a
rutile structure.14 The surface geometry relations between the
110 plane of RuO2 and BPO are reasonable according to
the calculations by author. The peak of BFO110 shows
high intensity which indicates excellent crystal quality. BPO
electrodes deposited on Pt/Ru layers exhibit random orien-
tation. The BFO films deposited on the randomly oriented
BPO electrodes self-organize to produce 111-preferred ori-
entation, indicating that the BPO electrode enhances the
growth of 111-oriented BFO films. The 111-preferred ori-
entation of BFO films was attributed to the difference of
nucleation and growth rates among different orientations.15,16
Comparing the peak intensities of 111- and 110-oriented
BFO films, the crystal quality of the 111-oriented film is
lower than that of the 110-oriented one. No RuO2 or other
second phases are observed after the deposition of BPO and
BFO layers in both XRD patterns because of the low process
temperature employed.
The compositional depth profiles of the 110-oriented
BFO film on a BFO/Ru substrate investigated by SIMS are
shown in Fig. 2, indicating interdiffusion among the BFO,
BPO, and Ru layers. The depth profiles also reveal that each
component of the BFO films exhibits a uniform distribution
also at the interface between the BFO and the BPO electrode.
The outdiffusion of Pb, Ba, and Ru ion in BFO films is
negligible. It is worth mentioning that the outdiffused Ru
affects the electrical properties of ferroelectric films. A com-
parison of BFO film on BPO with that on Pt Ref. 17 reveals
that the dead layer is much thinner. The 111-oriented BFO
films deposited on BPO/Pt/Ru show similar results. Based
on the results, the BPO/Ru and BPO/Pt/Ru electrode/
diffusion barrier layers not only prevent the diffusion of Pb
and O to Si substrates and Ru to BFO films effectively but
also produce advantageous 110- and 111-oriented BFO
films. In addition, a BPO electrode can provide a better in-
terface between BFO and BPO than that on a Pt electrode.
Figure 3 shows the hysteresis loops of 110- and 111-
oriented BFO films deposited on BPO/Ru and BPO/Pt/Ru,
respectively, demonstrating excellent ferroelectric properties
with a low contribution from leakage. The values of remnant
polarization Pr and coercive field Ec measured under
about 1100 kV/cm are 41.8 C/cm2, 522 kV/cm and
42.3 C/cm2, 650 kV/cm for 110- and 111-oriented
BFO films, respectively. In view of the literature, spontane-
ous polarization of BFO is along the 111 direction, so that
the 111-oriented BFO films theoretically should possess
larger Pr values than the 110-oriented BFO films. However,
the Pr values of 110- and 111-oriented BFO films are very
close to each other. This proximity is attributed to the lower
crystal quality of 111-oriented BFO film than that of the
110-oriented film, as shown in XRD. The lower crystal
quality and orientation indicate a higher Ec for the 111-
oriented film than that for the 110-oriented film.
In application, the frequency of writing and reading
pulses is on the order of megahertz, while the pulse width
may be on the order of microseconds. It is valuable to inves-
tigate the polarization response of pulse measurement as a
function of pulse width. The polarization response of BFO
films after the application of pulse excitation signals with
pulse widths in the range of 8 s–0.1 s was recorded posi-

properties of Ti-doped BFO films were not much improved. Uchida
et al. fabricated La-substituted BFO thin films with the CSD tech-
nique, producing films with improved ferroelectric properties and
decreased leakage current density.6 Lee et al. reported that La-
modified BFO films enhanced not only electrical properties but also
magnetic properties when the sputtering deposition method was
used.11
In this study, Ti ion and La ion were used to substitute the Fe site
and Bi site in BFO, respectively. The influence on crystallization,
microstructure, and electrical properties by La-doping, Ti-doping,
and La, Ti-co-doping are reported. La-doping and La, Ti-co-
doping is an effective method for reducing leakage current. The
leakage conduction mechanisms of all the films are also discussed.
Although the leakage mechanism of pure BFO films was studied,
such as space charge limited conduction SCLC4,7 and a mixed
conduction of Schottky and Poole-Frenkel models,12 that of doped
pA meter/dc voltage source.
Figure 1 shows XRD patterns of pure BFO, BFT, BLF, and
BLFT films annealed at 550°C for 10 min. All films consist of
single perovskite phase without any second phase. The BFO
and BFT films crystallize when the annealing temperature is
above 500°C; however, BLF and BLFT start to crystallize at tem-
peratures higher than 550°C. The chemical bond strength of La–O
bonds 799 ± 4 kJ/mol is much larger than that of Bi–O
337.2 ± 16.7 kJ/mol,13 therefore, the substitution of La for Bi re-
quires higher temperatures for the perovskite phase to crystallize.

BiFeO3 BFO is a potential material in the multiferroic materi-
als class which can be used at room temperature because it exhibits
ferroelectric ordering with a Curie temperature of about 850°C and
antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature of about
370°C.1 BFO has a rhombohedral perovskite structure, which be-
longs to the space group R3c, with unit cell parameters a
= 5.616 Å and  = 59.35°.2 BFO possesses high remnant polariza-
tion Pr values in comparison with other Pb-free ferroelectric ma-
terials such as SrBi2Ta2O9 and Bi4Ti3O123 and is also a material
which exhibits ferro-electromagnetism at room temperature. In re-
cent years, BFO thin films grown by either pulsed laser deposition
PLD,1,4,5 chemical solution deposition CSD,6,7 or sputtering
deposition8 have demonstrated high remnant polarization and im-
proved ferroelectric properties.
One of the major problems of BFO thin films is their low elec-
trical resistivity, which affects the application of ferroelectric prop-
erties. The relatively low resistivity of BFO is believed to be attrib-
uted to the existence of Fe2+ ions, impurity phases, and oxygen
vacancies.9 In the past, researchers employed various approaches to
achieve low leakage current densities of the BFO films. Singh
et al.10 modified the processes of CSD BFO films; although the
leakage current density was reduced, the polarization-electrical field
P-E hysteresis loops measured at room temperature were still
leaky. Ion substitution in BFO crystal may be one of the most effec-
tive techniques for improving the electric properties. Qi et al. re-
ported the effect of Ni2+ and Ti4+ on the leakage current density and
conduction mechanism of BFO films using the PLD techniques.4
Their results indicated that the Ni2+-doped BFO films contained a
higher level of oxygen vacancies which led to a higher leakage

BFO has not yet been investigated. The leakage mechanisms cannot
only help us to understand the origin of leakage current but also
know how to reduce it.
The compositions of BFO films investigated were pure
BiFeO3, BiFe0.95Ti0.05O3 BFT, Bi0.95La0.05FeO3 BLF, and
Bi0.95La0.05Fe0.95Ti0.05O3 BLFT. Five mole percent excess bismuth
was employed in preparing precursor solutions to compensate for
the Bi volatilization during annealing. BismuthIII acetate, ironIII
acetylacetonate, lanthanumIII nitrate, and titaniumIV isopro-
poxide were used as starting materials. Propionic acid and
2-methoxyethanol with a weight ratio of 3:1 were chosen as the
solvent. The mixed solvent was dehydrated at 110°C for 1 h. Sub-
sequently, the starting materials were added into the solvent and
stirred at 110°C for 30 min. The solution was refluxed at 80°C for
1 h and cooled to room temperature. The cooled precursor solution
was spin-coated on Pt111/Ti/SiO2/Si100 substrates under
2500 rpm for 30 s, dried at 150°C for 5 min, and baked at 350°C
for 10 min on hot plates. The resultant films were then annealed at
550°C for 10 min in N2 atmosphere. The thickness of all the thin
films was about 200 nm. Circular Pt top electrodes with diameters of
100 m were deposited on the films by sputtering deposition. After
deposition of the top electrode, postannealing at 300°C for 3 min
was employed. The crystal structures of the films were determined

about 6.25–6.84. The extracted dielectric constants are reasonably
close to the reported ones. The Poole-Frenkel trap heights of BLF
extracted from four leakage curves are about 1.60–1.67 eV. This
value indicates that the energy level of the defect traps is located in
the middle of the forbidden gap. When the leakage data of BFT
films are fitted by Schottky conduction, the extracted dielectric con-
stants are smaller than 1. Because the dielectric constants of mate-
rials cannot be smaller than 1, Schottky conduction is ruled out.
Comparing the leakage current of pure BFO film with that of
BFT film, the leakage was not reduced by Ti4+ doping. Improved
leakage behavior can be obtained in BLF and BLFT films. The
results of BFT are different from those in Ref. 4. The Fe3+ ions
replaced by Ti4+ can create electrons. If the dominant defects are
oxygen vacancies, electrons would eliminate oxygen vacancies. On
the other hand, if the dominant defects are cation vacancies such as
VBi, the high valence ion substitution would not reduce leakage
current. Qi et al.4 prepared BFO films by pulsed laser deposition,
which is under the low oxygen partial pressures. It is much more
likely that defect formation by oxygen deficiency will dominate and
the electrons produced by Ti ion substitutions can eliminate oxygen
vacancies. However, the dominant defects of BFO fabricated by
chemical solution deposition may not be oxygen vacancies; the elec-
trons produced by Ti ion substitutions become conducting electrons
and slightly degenerate electric properties. The differences between
our BLF film and those of others6,18 may result from the different
precursors and solvent. Uchida et al.18 reported that the ferroelec-
tricity of the BFO film was degraded by ion modification using
rare-earth cations, which is similar to other perovskite-based ferro-
electrics. The degraded ferroelectric properties by ion modification
using rare-earth cations occurred in 5% mol La-doping in our CSD
system. That the relaxation gap of BFT is larger than that of BFO is
also reasonable. An increasing leakage current and film with more
conducting electrons was obtained in BFT, which degenerate the

conducting electrons residing in the electrode can build up a depo-
larization field, which degenerates the short time relaxation, which
can increase the relaxation gap of P-E loop.19 On the other hand,

BiFeO3 BFO thin films produced with varied film thicknesses ranging from 100 to 230 nm were
fabricated on BaPbO3BPO /Pt/Ti/SiOx /Si substrates by rf-magnetron sputtering. Saturated
polarization–electrical field hysteresis loops, polarization response by pulse measurement, and
retention properties were obtained for BFO films with various thicknesses on BPO. The retention
behaviors of BFO demonstrate logarithmic time dependence and stretched exponential law. When
the thicknesses of BFO films increase, the contribution of logarithmic time dependence to retention,
the stretched exponential law becomes dominant. BFO films with thinner thickness exhibit better
retention properties but possess smaller remnant polarization. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

There have been many reports on candidate ferroelectric
materials for ferroelectric random access memory FRAM
applications, such as Bi4−xLaxTi3O12,1 PbZr1−x ,TixO3
PZT,2 and BiFeO3 BFO.3 BFO possesses large polariza-
tion values and low crystallization temperatures, both of
which are the desirable properties for high density FRAM.3–6
Application of the Pt layer as the bottom electrode pro-
vides low resistivity and high temperature stability, but some
disadvantages have been observed, including deterioration of
ferroelectric properties by interdiffusion with the interposed
adhesion layer of Ti on the substrate, formation of hillocks,
and formation of dead layers at interfaces. Conductive oxide
layers as electrodes were confirmed to be a good alternative
for solving these problems.3,7,8 The conductive oxide elec-
trode applied here, BaPbO3 BPO, can be regarded as a
cubic perovskite.9 The reasons for choosing BPO as the bot-
tom electrode are: 1 BPO exhibits similar structure to BFO,
and 2 growth temperature of BPO is quite lower than most
oxide electrode. Moreover, BPO possesses higher work func-
tion than most oxidation electrodes and the ability of inter-
diffusion prevention. The work function of BPO measured
by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy is about 5.1 eV,
which can be comparable with that of Pt. The electric resis-
tivity of BPO on Pt/Ti/SiOx /Si is believed to be low
enough, which does not affect the BFO with different film
thicknesses.
The trend of miniaturization of devices requires the re-
duction of the thickness of films. Therefore, we report the
thickness-dependent electrical properties of BFO thin films
fabricated by rf-sputtering on BPO electrodes. The retention
behaviors of the BFO on the BPO electrode are also dis-
cussed, a topic which has yet to be addressed in the current
literature.
The BPO bottom electrode was deposited on
Pt111 /Ti/SiOx /Si by rf-magnetron sputtering at 350 °C
with a working pressure of 80 mTorr. The deposition param-
eters of BFO films were described elsewhere.6 The film
thicknesses of BFO thin films on BPO with 40, 60, and
90 min deposition times are 100, 135, and 230 nm, respec-
tively. The crystal structures of the films were determined by
x-ray diffraction XRD Rikagu with Cu K radiation. The
polarization–electrical field P-E hysteresis curves, pulse
measurement, and retention measurement were measured us-
ing TF Analyzer 2000 FE-Module axiACCT Co. ferroelec-
tric test system. The P-E curves were obtained with a fre-
quency of 1 kHz at room temperature.
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of BFOs deposited on
BPO electrodes with various film thicknesses. BFO depos-
ited on BPO consists of 111-oriented films, exhibits pure
perovskite phase, and is without impurity phases. The 111
orientation of the BFO deposited on BPO can be attributed to
the differences in nucleation energy or growth rate between
the different orientations.10 The relative diffraction intensi-
ties of 111 I111/ I111+ I100 of BFOs on BPO with thick-
nesses of 100, 135, and 230 nm are 76.7%, 75.8%, and
77.1%, respectively. This implies that the thicknesses of the
BFOs on BPO do not affect the texture of the BFO films. The
result can be explained by the lower nucleation energies of
111 orientation rather than the faster growth rates of 111
orientation.

In Fig. 2, all BFO films exhibit relaxation in the P-E
loops. A prepoling and 1 s relaxation time were utilized be-
fore a continuous measurement pulse was applied in P-E
measurement. Therefore, a short time relaxation within 1 s
can be observed in P-E loops. In PUND measurement,
shown in Fig. 3a, the P, U, N, and D pulses were applied
individually, separated by a delay period. Therefore, the P
value of the PUND measurement is relaxed and decreases
with decreasing film thickness. As the result above, the short
time relaxation is more severe with decreasing BFO film
thickness. Figure 3 indicates that as film thickness decreases,
the retention behavior is dominated by logarithmic time de-
pendence in the short relaxation time and the stretched ex-
ponential law in the long relaxation time. It is inferred that
the depolarization field becomes an important issue with de-
creasing film thickness. In general, the polarization can in-
duce charges in the electrodes. Uncompensated charges re-
siding in the electrode build up a depolarization field at the
interface.18 Mehta et al.18 indicated that the depoling field
increases with decreasing ferroelectric film thickness; there-
fore, the 1 s retention is more severe in thinner ferroelectric
film. When the BFO film thickness is increased, the effect of
depolarization is reduced, and the retention behavior is domi-
nated by defects or space charge redistribution. Therefore,
the thinner BFO films possess increasing P-E relaxations and
decreasing P values. Their retention behaviors are gov-
erned by logarithmic time dependence, which is related to
space charge redistribution or depolarization field, within
short time retention, as well as by stretched exponential law,
which is related to space charge redistribution only, in the
long time retention region. On the other hand, the stretched
exponential law is more dominant for thicker BFO film.
BFO thin films were fabricated on BPO electrodes by
rf-magnetron sputtering deposition. The film thicknesses of
BFOs ranged from 100 to 230 nm. The XRD pattern exhibits
a pure perovskite phase and 111-preferred orientation. BFO
films with thinner film thicknesses exhibited better retention
properties but possess smaller P values in PUND measure-
ments. Short time retention is more severe when the BFO
thickness is decreased, which is related to depolarization
field. The retention behaviors of BFOs on BPO display loga-
rithmic time dependence and stretched exponential law for
BFOs with 100 and 135 nm film thicknesses, while the BFO
film with 230 nm thickness possesses the stretched exponen-
tial law. The behavior of logarithmic time dependence de-
creases when the BFO thickness increases.

sweeping the gate voltage from accumulation to inversion
region and then sweeping back. The C-V curve of the ZrO2
film annealed at 600 °C for 10 min exhibits hysteresis be-
havior, while the one annealed at 700 °C shows no hyster-
esis. The hysteresis of the 600 °C-annealed ZrO2 film is
counterclockwise, which indicates that electrons inject from
the gate to the ZrO2 film. The trapped injected electrons in
the ZrO2 film offset the polarization of ferroelectric films.
Figure 1 demonstrates that the 700 °C-annealed ZrO2 layer
possesses negligible charge injection and charge trapping,
which are possibly due to the formation of interfacial layer
that blocks the charge injection. The annealed BFO films on
ZrO2/Si substrates possess pure perovskite without other
second phases. The P-E hysteresis of the Pt/BFO/Pt structure
annealed at 550 °C is shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The
coercive field and the remnant polarization of the BFO film
are 300 kV/cm and 13.5 C/cm2, respectively, under
400 kV/cm. The leakage current density for the BFO film at
400 kV/cm 10 V is about 0.1 A/cm2, which is relatively
high that the hysteresis curve shows round shape at the top
right corner. In contrast, the leakage density at 360 kV/cm
9 V is about 1.5–2 orders of magnitude lower, the round
shape at the corner is not significant. The leakage current is
reduced to 10−6–10−5 A/cm2 at 400 kV/cm 10 V for the
Pt/BFO/ZrO2/Si MFIS structure.
The C-V properties of the Pt/BFO/ZrO2/Si MFIS struc-
tures in depletion region at 1 MHz are shown in Fig. 2a.
The inset of Fig. 2a shows the C-V properties at higher
sweeping voltages than ±5 V. The C-V profiles show clock-
wise hysteresis loops when the sweeping bias is in the range
of ±2– ±5 V, which is considered as the ferroelectric polar-
ization effect. However, the memory window width de-
creases from 0.66 to 0.15 V, as shown in Fig. 3, when the
applied voltage increases from ±2 to ±5 V. It indicates that
some mechanisms tend to offset the polarization effect.
When the sweeping voltage is higher than 5 V, the C-V
loops become counterclockwise, indicating that the charge
injection effect is serious.
The magnitude of the memory window is closely related
to two factors: 1 the coercive field and the saturation po-
larization of the ferroelectric layer, and 2 the charge injec-
tion from the silicon substrate or metal gate. The former is
beneficial for increasing memory windows but the latter usu-
ally neutralizes the ferroelectric effect, which not only de-
creases the memory windows but also causes counterclock-
wise hysteresis.14 Since the hysteresis of the Pt/ZrO2/Si
structures is almost zero, it indicates that the charge trapping
and the charge injection effect are negligible for this range of
sweeping bias. The measured memory window is much
smaller than that calculated from the above equation. To in-
vestigate the possible mechanism that offset the polarization
effect of the BFO ferroelectrics, C-V measurement with
varying frequency was performed and the result is displayed
in Fig. 4a. The insets of Fig. 4 are amplified plots of the
displayed loops. Figure 4a demonstrates that there are
kinks existing in the C-V hysteresis loops of low frequency
side, ranging from 500 Hz–1k Hz. The occurrence of kinks
is attributed to the interface trap states. Since the ZrO2/Si
interface shows no traps as evidenced in Fig. 1, the interface
trap states should locate in the BFO/ZrO2 interface.
To improve the interface trap state, various annealing
conditions were investigated. The one which shows im-
proved properties was the BFO film deposited on unannealed
ZrO2/Si, and then the BFO/ZrO2/Si structure was annealed
at 550 °C for 10 min sample U. The C-V properties with
±3 to ±6 V sweep voltage are exhibited in Fig. 2b. The
clockwise loops are caused by the ferroelectric polarization
of BFO. The C-V properties of the sweeping voltage larger
than ±7 V are shown in the inset of Fig. 2b, exhibiting that
the clockwise loop have shifted to the left hand side which is
caused by charge injection. The memory windows are dis-
played in Fig. 3. The memory window increases from
0.25 to 0.78 V when the sweeping voltage increases from
±2 to ±6 V, and then decreases with further increases of
sweeping voltage. Figure 4b illustrates the C-V hysteresis
loops measured under various frequencies, demonstrating no
