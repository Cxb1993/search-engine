一、中文摘要 
儘管 Fitts’ law (1954) 是最常被用來評估
電腦輸入設備的方法，但以 Fitts’ law 作為評
估方法，不僅存在著理論上的問題，也無法
提供操控設備時，移動速度與準確度上獨立
表現的評估。本研究的主要目的除了驗證以
兩種彈道式移動模型作為電腦滑鼠評估方法
的有效性外，並證實此新評估方法的優越
性。在兩個階段的實驗中，八名受測者使用
四款滑鼠分別執行彈道式移動與自控步調瞄
準移動。得到的實驗數據再分別以彈道式移
動模型和 Fitts’ law 方法進行四款滑鼠的分析

二、英文摘要 
Although Fitts’ law (1954) is the most 
comment method utilized to evaluate computer 
input devices, using Fitts’ law as an evaluation 
method is not completely supported by 
theoretical rationale.  Furthermore, the Fitts’ 
law method cannot provide independent 
evaluation information of speed and accuracy 
while operating input devices.  The main 
purposes of this study were (1) to validate the 
application of ballistic movement models for 
evaluating computer mice and (2) to 
demonstrate the superiority of this new 
evaluation method.  In a two-stage experiment, 
eight participants used four different types of 
computer mice to execute self-paced aiming 
movements and ballistic movements, 
respectively.  The measured data then were 
analyzed by Fitts’ law and ballistic movement 
models so that ballistic movement models’ 
evaluation effectiveness of computer mice 
could be compared with Fitts’ law.  Our results 
showed that (1) ballistic movement models can 
well fit the measured data and (2) the new 
evaluation method can provide independent 
performance information of “speed” and 
“accuracy” while operating mice.  Future 
research could focus on evaluating computer 
mouse, and measuring individual differences. 
Keywords： Fitts’ law, computer mouse, input 
device, ballistic movement, aiming movement 
1. 前言 
電腦的使用對於現代人的生活，不管是辦

移動所需要花費的時間。Lin (2009) 已證實
Gan & Hoffmann (1988) 所提出的公式 6 能有
效地描述與預測彈道式移動時間( )與
彈道式移動距離( )之間的關係。 
      (6) 
公式中的 和 為實驗常數項。如公式所示，
執行彈道式移動所需要的時間與移動的距離
的平方根成線性關係。 
2.4 彈道式移動變異模型 
彈道式移動變異為一個彈道式移動的落
點誤差。在人的動作控制系統中，由於存在
著某些神經雜訊，彈道式移動無法每一次準
確地依照大腦所下達的指令停留在預定的目
標點上(Milner, 1992; Novak et al., 2000)。不管
落點誤差的量測方式是和移動的方向呈平行
或垂直，實際落點的分佈機率會是一個以目
標 點 為 中 心 的 常 態 分 配 (Crossman and 
Goodeve, 1963/1983; Fitts, 1954)。為了描述彈
道式移動在二維空間中的落點誤差，Lin 
(2009) 驗證了 Howarth et al. (1971) 所發展
的公式7對於兩種彈道式移動變異( )的有效
性。 
       (7) 
公式中的 和 為實驗常數項。驗證結果顯
示：不管是與移動方向平行或與垂直所量測
到的兩種誤差 ( 和 ) 都與彈道式移動的
距離的平方 ( ) 成線性關係。 
2.5 研究動機及目的 
雖然 Fitts’ law 本身和所描述的瞄準移動
已被廣泛地作為評估電腦輸入設備的方法，
但此方法存在著特定的限制。除了上述所提
到理論上的問題外，Fitts’ law 方法所得到的
是輸入設備在操作時間上的整合性的結果；
所量測到的時間是由輸入設備在操控速度以
及操控準確度上兩個表現的結果。無論是利
用迴歸線比較圖、表現指標或總處理能力，
評估人員雖可以比較不同設備在整體時間上
的表現，但卻無法得知設備在「速度」及「準
確度」上的獨立表現。 
為了克服 Fitts’ law 方法的限制，本研究
的主要目的是驗證以彈道式移動以及兩種彈
道式移動模型作為評估方法的優越性及有效
性。 
3. 研究方法 
3.1 受測者與實驗設備 
實驗受測者為四名 (兩男兩女) 年齡介於
19 至 20 歲的大學生。每位受測者的慣用手都
是右手，矯正後的視力都在 0.9 以上。 
實驗設備包含硬體設備和軟體程式。硬體
設備為一台個人電腦及六款不同設計的滑鼠

3.2 實驗設置 
實驗主要包含兩個階段，四名受測者在兩
個階段中以六款滑鼠分別執行自控步調瞄準
移動與彈道式移動。每位受測者在正式量測
執行前，有充足的時間 (二到三小時) 熟悉六
款滑鼠對於兩種移動程式的操作。在第一階
段執行彈道式移動的過程中，受測者依照彈
道式移動執行程式的指示，使用指定的滑鼠
執行各種距離的彈道式移動。執行程式會在
受測者執行每一個彈道式移動前出現如圖 2
的畫面。接著，受測者以滑鼠控制電腦游標
移動至圖中的起始點後，按下滑鼠的左鍵以
做好開始執行彈道式移動的準備。在執行移

移動距離三個自變項對移動時間皆有極顯著
的影響( )。 
4.2 以 Fitts’ law 評估滑鼠的結果

Abstract. The main objective of this research was to develop a methodology based on Drury’s [1] intermittent illumination model 
to directly measure individuals’ corrective reaction times, without the two methodology-related issues of Lin & Drury [2].  Six 
highly-practiced participants performed self-paced circular tracking tasks by using a modified LED monitor in a darkened room.  
While performing movements, the monitor’s backlight was intermittently turned on and off to generate five values of expected 
delay of visual feedback.  Expected delay and measured speed were used with the intermittent illumination model to calculate 
individuals’ corrective reaction times.  The results of showed that the model fitted the data very well, accounts for at least 94.6 % 
of the variance.  The mean corrective reaction time was 273 milliseconds and ranged from 170 to 460 milliseconds for individual 
participants.  While previous studies only reported group means, this was the first study to report individuals’ corrective reaction 
times.

Abstract.  The study of ballistic movement time and ballistic movement variability can help us understand how our motor system 
works and further predict the relationship of speed-accuracy tradeoffs while performing complex hand-control movements.  The 
purposes of this study were (1) to develop an experiment for measuring ballistic movement time and variability and (2) to utilize 
the measured data to test the application of the two models for predicting the two types of ballistic movement data.  In this 
preliminary study, four participants conducted ballistic movements of specific amplitudes, by using a personal computer, a drawing 
tablet and a self-developed experimental program.  The results showed that (1) the experiment successfully measured ballistic 
movement time and two types of ballistic movement variability, (2) the two models described well the measured data, and (3) a 
modified model was proposed to fit better the variable error in the direction of the direction of the movement. 
Keywords: Fitts’ law, aiming movement, ballistic movement, hand-control movement, movement time, and end-point variability

二、與會心得	
於會議過程中發現人因工程在國際間的發展趨勢，已從傳統的工業安全防護廣泛擴展至其他
新興研究領域。這些新興的領域包含：通用設計、虛擬實境或擴增實境的應用、網路社交互動、
使用者介面和使用者中心設計。由此可見，人因工程所著重的「人」的角色，已從「作業人員」
轉至「使用者」。如此的改變主要來自於消費者意識的抬頭。不同於過去的消費者，現在的消費
者不再順從地去學習不考慮使用者需求下所設計、生產出來的工具或產品；取而代之的是，消費
者願意花較高的成本，去選擇容易學習(甚至是不用學習)及使用上不容易發生錯誤的產品。 
對於製造產業不再擁有優勢的台灣，應著重於產品、設備或系統的設計與開發。為了開發設
計出好的產品，人因工程所扮演的角色是必然的。在這一次的會議中遇見了多位一同與會的台灣
學者，在討論中發現，台灣過去及目前所著重的人因工程為傳統人因工程，如職業傷害的防制、
工作效率及工作現場的改善等，而和產品設計相關的研究仍存在很多發展的空間。為了因應台灣
接下來產業的發展趨勢，國內人因工程的發展或許可向以下幾個研究領域進行發展。 
1. Human Factors Application related to VR/AR 
2. User Experience and Usability 
3. Online Communities and Social Computing 
4. Virtual Working Environment 
5. Human Computer Interaction in Healthcare Systems 
6. Product Design 
三、考察參觀活動

Abstract. The study of ballistic movement time and ballistic movement 
variability can help us understand how our motor system works and further 
predict the relationship of speed-accuracy tradeoffs while performing complex 
hand-control movements. The purposes of this study were (1) to develop an 
experiment for measuring ballistic movement time and variability and (2) to 
utilize the measured data to test the application of the two models for predicting 
the two types of ballistic movement data. In this preliminary study, four 
participants conducted ballistic movements of specific amplitudes, by using a 
personal computer, a drawing tablet and a self-developed experimental program. 
The results showed that (1) the experiment successfully measured ballistic 
movement time and two types of ballistic movement variability, (2) the two 
models described well the measured data, and (3) a modified model was proposed 
to fit better the variable error in the direction of the direction of the movement. 
Keywords: Fitts’ law, aiming movement, ballistic movement, hand-control 
movement, movement time, and end-point variability. 
1   Introduction 
Hand-control movements occur in numerous everyday activities, such as approaching 
and grasping an object or pointing a computer cursor to move to an icon. The speed-
accuracy tradeoff relationship for hand-control movements has been one of the most 
important issues studied by researchers in this field. Faster movements are usually 
spatially less accurate, and inversely, movements desiring greater spatial accuracy are 
performed at the expense of slower speeds. 
Since Woodworth’s [1] pioneer study, researchers have studied the speed-accuracy 
tradeoff in normal hand-control movements. The speed-accuracy tradeoffs are 
commonly studied for two types of movements: self-paced aiming movements and 
self-paced tracking movements. Fitts’ [2] law and Drury’s [3] model have been 
validated to predict well the two types of tradeoffs, respectively. 
Beyond experimental modeling of the tradeoffs, researchers further studied how the 
two types of tradeoff result from our motor control mechanism. Because the utility of 
visual feedback on movement accuracy is intermittent, instead of continuous, a  
hand-control movement is typically composed of one or more than one sequential  
sub-movement. These sub-movements are programmed by the brain based only on 
one-time visual feedback, and are thus called “ballistic movements”. In fact, these

1.3   Ballistic Movement Variability 
Ballistic movement variability describes the endpoint variability of a ballistic 
movement. Because of noise existing in our motor control mechanism, the ultimate 
endpoint of a ballistic movement may not be exactly at the aimed point [20, 21]. 
While performing the movement repeatedly, the probability of its endpoint location 
would be a bivariate normal distribution around the aimed point [1, 22]. 
Beggs, Howarth and their colleges [23-26] conducted a series of studies that were 
related to modeling ballistic movement variability. To study how visual information 
affects movement accuracy, Beggs & Howarth [23] conducted an experiment in 
which their participants moved a pencil from a home position near their shoulders to 
hit a target attached on a vertical plate placed in front of them. The movement 
distance was about 50 cm and the movement speed was paced by a metronome with 
different frequencies. To ensure that the movements were uncontrolled (i.e., moving 
without visual feedback), the room illumination was turned off before reaching the 
vertical plate at several distances from the plate. For the uncontrolled part of these 
movements, Beggs & Howarth [26] found that Equation 2, developed by Howarth et 
al. [25], could well predict that the standard deviation of the aiming error (ߪ) was 
proportional to the uncontrolled distance (݀௨). 
ߪଶ ൌ ܿ ൅ ݀ ൈ ݀௨ଶ (2)
where ܿ  and ݀  are experimentally determined constants, and ݀௨  is uncontrolled 
movement distance, as in Equation 1. 
1.4   Research Objectives 
At first glance, the movements modeled by Gan & Hoffmann [8] and Beggs & 
Howarth [26] were ballistic and hence Equation 1 and Equation 2 seem that they can 
directly be utilized to predict the two properties of ballistic movement. On closer 
consideration, further investigation is required to validate their applications. First, the 
movements studied by Gan & Hoffmann [8] could not represent the population of all 
ballistic movements as defined in this study. Because, the ballistic movements studied 
by Gan & Hoffmann [8] were aiming movements with small ID. The authors stated 
that these movements were different from Fitts-type aiming movements because these 
movements were all performed under 200 milliseconds during which movement 
accuracy would not be improved by visual feedback during the execution. 
Nevertheless, the ballistic movements as defined in this study were not restricted to 
certain movement time. Secondly, the movements studied by Beggs & Howarth [26] 
did not exactly qualify under our definitions for a ballistic movement. The ballistic 
part of movements modeled by Beggs & Howarth [26] were performed with nonzero 
starting speeds as the room illumination was turned off. Also, the aiming movements 
studied by Beggs & Howarth [26] were paced movements; paced by a metronome. It 
has been shown that aiming movement accuracy would be diminished if the 
movements are paced [21]. Finally, the aiming error reported in Beggs & Howarth 
[26] was only measured perpendicular to the movement direction.  
 Verification of Two Models of Ballistic Movements 279 
were manipulated to generate four different start-point locations, helping eliminate 
learned kinesthetic feedback. Every experimental combination was replicated five 
times, resulting in a total of 280 trials. All the trials were randomly conducted by each 
participant, taking about half an hour to finish. There was a half-hour practice before 
the formal measurement. 
Three dependent variables, comprising ballistic movement time ( ݐ௕௔௟௟௟௜௧௜௖ ), 
longitudinal error and lateral error, were automatically recorded by the experimental 
program after every completed experimental trial. The longitudinal error, or X-error, 
was the longitudinal discrepancy between a ballistic movement endpoint and the 
target cross. Similarly, the lateral error, or Y-error, was the perpendicular discrepancy 
between the endpoint and the target cross. 
3   Results 
3.1   Ballistic Movement Time 
Analysis of variance was performed on the movement times, using a mixed model 
with Distance, X Shift and Y Shifts as fixed effects and Participant as random, in 
which the two-way, three-way, and four-way interaction effects among all the effects 
were analyzed. The results showed significant main effects of Participant (ܨଷ,଼ଽ଺ ൌ
12.42 , ݌ ൏ 0.001 ) and Distance ( ܨଵଷ,଼ଽ଺ ൌ 64.12 , ݌ ൏ 0.001 ) and two-way 
interaction effects of Participant ൈ  Distance ( ܨଷ,଼ଽ଺ ൌ 7.55 , ݌ ൏ 0.001 ). These 
significant effects showed that (1) participants performed the movements with 
different ballistic movement times, (2) the increase of ballistic movement distance 
results in increased ballistic movement time, and (3) these rates of increase of ballistic 
movement time were different for the participants, representing the interaction effect 
of Participant ൈ Distance. 
Because a significant main effect of Distance was found, the application of Gan & 
Hoffmann’s [8] model could be tested. The means of ballistic movement time 
(ݐ௕௔௟௟௟௜௧௜௖) were regressed on to the square root of ballistic movement distance (ඥ݀௨) 
to give the slopes and intercepts. The model fitted the data very well. It accounted for 
98.1 % variance of the overall participants’ data and at least 95.2 % variance of 
individual participants’ data. The regression lines of the overall participants and of 
individual participants are shown in Fig. 1, which also shows good model fittings. 
3.2   Ballistic Movement Variability 
End-point errors were measured as both longitudinal error (X error) and lateral error 
(Y error) relative to the movement direction. Both were verified to be normally 
distributed (݌ ൏ 0.001). The errors consisted of constant error and variable error. To 
analyze whether the independent variables had significant effects on these two types 
of errors, five replications of each experimental combination were utilized to calculate 
the constant error and the variable error (measured by variance). However, only the 
results of variable error are discussed in this article.

For X-variable error, Equation 3 accounted for 98.5 % variance of the overall 
participants’ data and at least 81.9 % variance of individual participants’ data. For Y-
variable error, Equation 3 accounted for 96.5 % variance of the overall participants’ 
data and at least 70.7 % variance of individual participants’ data. Further, the 
regression lines of the overall participants’ ߪ௑ଶ and ߪ௒ଶ data are shown in Fig. 3. As 
shown in the figure, Equation 3 can fit the X-variable error somewhat better than 
Equation 2.

Abstract. The main objective of this research was to develop a methodology 
based on Drury’s [1] intermittent illumination model to directly measure indi-
viduals’ corrective reaction times, without the two methodology-related issues 
of Lin & Drury [2].  Six highly-practiced participants performed self-paced cir-
cular tracking tasks by using a modified LED monitor in a darkened room. 
While performing movements, the monitor’s backlight was intermittently 
turned on and off to generate five values of expected delay of visual feedback. 
Expected delay and measured speed were used with the intermittent illumina-
tion model to calculate individuals’ corrective reaction times.  The results of 
showed that the model fitted the data very well, accounts for at least 94.6 % of 
the variance.  The mean corrective reaction time was 273 milliseconds and 
ranged from 170 to 460 milliseconds for individual participants.  While pre-
vious studies only reported group means, this was the first study to report  
individuals’ corrective reaction times.   
Keywords: corrective reaction time, intermittent illumination model,  
hand-control movement, tracking movement.  
1   Introduction 
Corrective reaction time is an important component of the study and modeling hand-
control movements.  Due to the psychological refractory period [3], the utility of 
visual feedback on movement accuracy is intermittent, instead of continuous.  Hence, 
a hand-control movement, such as pointing a fingertip to click a button on a touch 
screen, might be consist of more than one ballistic movement, each correcting the 
distance remaining between the fingertip and the button.  The shortest time between 
the end of one ballistic movement and the start of the next is called the “corrective 
reaction time” during which the brain receives visual feedback, programs a movement 
impulse, and sends the impulse to the controlled limbs.  To better understand our 
motor control system and to predict the speed-accuracy tradeoff relationships while 
performing hand-control movements, it is necessary to measure the corrective  
reaction time effectively, particularly if we are to understand individual differences. 
Early findings on corrective reaction time come mainly from the studies of aiming 
movement.  Woodworth’s [4] pioneer work showed that aiming movements made at a 
 Measuring Corrective Reaction Time with the Intermittent Illumination Model 399 
corrective reaction time and the Expected Delay manipulated by the intermittent illumi-
nation of l and d.  The results from Tsao & Drury’s [8] experimental data showed that 
Equation (1) explained over 90% of the variance in the slopes of the speed/width regres-
sion for a variety of dark and light intervals.  Furthermore, the model gave an estimate 
for the mean corrective reaction time as 238 milliseconds.  As Keele & Posner’s [6] and 
Beggs & Howarth [7], Drury [1] did not report individual differences. 
Recently, Lin & Drury [2] redesigned Tsao & Drury’s [8] experimental method and 
attempted to precisely measure individuals’ corrective reaction times.  Instead of draw-
ing circles on white paper, their participants used a drawing tablet to control the screen 
cursor to draw circles within circular courses shown on the screen.  To generate the 
expected delay, instead of controlling the intermittent illumination, the visual informa-
tion of the cursor was intermittently displayed.  While performing movements, the  
cursor started to blink according to predetermined light/dark periods.  However, their 
measurement of the corrective reaction times did not match the results reported in the 
literature.  The two potential experimental design issues were reported as (1) inappro-
priate manipulations of the expected delay and (2) indirect visual feedback of control 
movements.  Hence, the main purposes of this study were to deal with the two issues 
mentioned by Lin & Drury [2] and thus develop a standard methodology to measure 
individuals’ corrective reaction times using the intermittent illumination model. 
2   Method 
2.1   Participants 
Six undergraduate students, two male and four female, aged from 19 to 20 years, were 
recruited to participate in this study.  They were all right-handed with normal or  
corrected-to-normal vision. 
2.2   Apparatus 
A personal computer (PC) with a 19” (48.3 cm) modified LED monitor was used.  To 
deal with the indirect visual feedback issue mentioned by Lin & Drury [2], the moni-
tor was attached with a touch panel so that the circular tasks could be performed di-
rectly on the monitor.  Further, the monitor was modified to a condition where its 
backlight could be turned on and off intermittently to generate intermittent visual 
feedback of the tracking circular courses, drawing stylus and the control limbs. 
The experimental program was developed similar to that used in Lin & Drury [2].  
The PC ran Visual Basic using this program to display the circular courses, generate 
the intermittent illuminations and measure movement speeds. 
2.3   Experimental Setting and Procedures 
The experiments were conducted in a darkened room and the only illumination source 
was provided by the modified LED monitor.  As shown in Fig. 1, while performing 
experimental tasks, participants sat on a chair.  The monitor was placed on an adjust-
able stool placed between participants’ legs.  Predetermined circular courses with a 
mean radius of 200 pixels (53.2 mm) and different course widths were displayed 
randomly on the screen.  To perform tracking movements, participants pressed down

3.1   Analysis of Variance 
Analysis of variance was performed on the speeds, using a mixed model with Width 
and Expected Delay as fixed effects and Participant as random, in which the two-way 
and three-way interaction effects among all the effects were analyzed.  Despite of 
Participants (significant at ), all the other main effects and all the interac-
tion effects were highly significant ( ).  Note that because of large num-
bers of measurement (total df = 13439), these significant effects were not practical.  
The main effect of Participant (see Fig. 3) showed that the participants performed the 
movement at different speeds.  The main effects and the two-way interaction effect of 
Width and Expected Delay are shown in Fig. 2, where (1) the increase of Course 
Width resulted in increased speed, (2) the increase of Expected Delay resulted in 
decreased speed and (3) these rates of decrease of speed were especially large when 
Expected Delay increased from 0.0 to 0.15 s, representing the interaction effect of 
Width  Expected Delay.

4   Discussion 
As predicted by Drury’s [9] and Drury’s [1] two models, increased course widths and 
decreased expected delay value resulted in increased movement speed.  Movement 
speeds measured under different expected delay values increased gradually as course 
width increased.  Moreover, movement speeds measured under different course 
widths decreased linearly according to the increase of expected delay.  However, the 
rate of decrease was greater when the expected delay value increased from 0 to 0.15 s 
compared to other changes.  There was clearly a large difference between no delay 
and some delay. 
By overcoming the two methodology-related issues of Lin & Drury [2], this study 
successfully measured individuals’ correction reaction time.  To make sure that par-
ticipants kept moving in the dark duration of the intermittent illumination, in this 
study, the expected delay values were manipulated by keeping dark durations were 
kept close (52 - 58 milliseconds) and varying light durations (350 - 1250 millise-
conds).  Note that in Lin & Drury [2], light durations were kept close (292 - 354 milli-
seconds) and dark durations were varied (500 – 1750 milliseconds).  Further, to make 
the visual feedback of the movements was directly from the controlled stylus, the 
participants in this study drew the tracking tasks on a modified LED monitor.  This 
experimental design was similar to that of Tsao & Drury [8], where the participants 
used a pen to drew circles on papers.  With these two experimental modifications and 
by highly practicing participants before formal measurements, we showed the good 
fitting of the intermittent illumination model [1].  The model accounted for 99.4 % 
variance of the overall measurements.  For individuals’ eight measurements, the mod-
el accounted for an average of 98.6 % of the variance and at least accounts for 97.2 % 
of the variance.

在過去 50 年中，Fitts’ Law 被人因工程與人機互動的研究學者及電子產品開發設計人員
視為非常重要且有效的評估量測方法。若在 Google Scholar 中以 Fitts’ Law 作為關鍵
字，我們可以輕易找到超過 15,000 篇相關的學術論文。這些論文主要是以 Fitts’ Law
量測人類在不同條件下的移動控制以及評估不同電子輸入設備。雖然 Fitts’ Law 的影響
力重要到被規範在 ISO 9241-9 中，但是 Fitts’ Law 所量測到的是移動控制時「速度」
與「準確度」的整合性結果。 
 
    藉著國科會計畫的補助支持，本人試著提出一個希望比 Fitts’ Law 更有效的方法。
本研究以不同款式的電腦滑鼠為評估範例，證實以兩個彈道式移動模型作為設備評估方
法，能將不同電腦滑鼠在「速度」與「準確度」上的表現作獨立的評估與比較。
