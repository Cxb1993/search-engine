observation. All of the stationary points of the CMA 
and the MMA are saddle points during the transient 
stage of the blind equalization process. Along 
convergence trajectories away from the saddle 
points in their error performance surfaces, both the 
CMA and the MMA follow directly in the direction 
of SGD that a marble would take. However, both 
the CMA and the MMA may be attracted along 
convergence trajectories to the vicinity of more than 
one of the saddle points in their error performance 
surfaces, where they exhibit slow convergence [13], 
[3]. A large (small) curvature of the error surface at 
a stationary point may indicate that the approach 
and escape rates around the saddle point are fast 
(slow) before converging to the desired minimum 
[1]. Therefore the error surface curvatures at 
stationary points may indicate the effect of source 
distributions on both the equalizer convergence and 
the phase tracking. 
Consider a complex baseband model with a 
channel impulse response of nc . The channel input 
and equalizer input are denoted by ns  and nu , 
respectively. The transmitted data symbols, ns , are 
assumed to consist of stationary independently and 
identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex non-Gaussian 
random variables. The channel is possibly a 
non-minimum phase linear time-invariant filter. The 
equalizer input, n n nu s c   is then sent to a 
tap-delay-line blind equalizer, nf , intended to 
equalize the distortion caused by ISI without a 
training signal. The output of the blind equalizer, 
n n n n ny f u s h   ★ , can be used to recover the 
transmitted data symbols, ns , where ★  denotes 
complex conjugation and n f cn nh  ★  denotes the 
impulse response of the combined 
channel-equalizer system whose parameter vector 
can be written as the time-varying 1 N  vector 
[ (1), (2),... ( )]n n nh h h Nh  with M arbitrarily located 
non-zero components at time, n, during the blind 
equalization process and M N , where 
1,2,3,...M  . For example, if 3M   and 
{1,2,5}MI   is any M-element subset of the 
integers, then [ (1), (2),0,0, (5),0 0]n n nh h hh   is a 
representative value of h . 
II. STATIONARY POINTS OF MMA AND 
CMA 
This section and Section III consider some 
properties of the MMA and the CMA. These 
properties are presented as lemmas. Consider the 
MMA cost function, which is given by 
   2 2 22, , 2,
2
,{[ ] } {[ ] }R I n IMMA R nE y R E y RJ      (1) 
where ,R ny  and ,I ny  are the real and imaginary 
parts of the equalizer output, respectively, while 
2,RR  and IR ,2  are given by 4 22, , ,[ ] [ ]R R n R nR E s E s  
and 4 22, , ,[ ] [ ]I I n I nR E s E s , in which ,R ns  and ,I ns  
denote the real and imaginary parts of ns , 
respectively. When there is no possibility of 
confusion, the notation is simplified by suppressing 
the time index n, e.g., n R Is s s js    and 
( ) ( )nh k h k . For notational simplicity, let 
4[ ]A E s , 4 43 [ ] 3 s sB E s k  , 22 46 [ ] 6 sC E s   
and 2 2,4 [ ] RD E s R . Lemmas 1 and 2 described 
below locate the stationary points of the MMA and 
the CMA, respectively. 
Lemma 1: All of the MMA stationary points can be 
summarized as follows. (i) 
( ( ), ( )) (0,0), 1,...,R Ih k h k for k N  ; (ii), 
, ( ) 2, 3 2Mk I for k    ; (iii)

2 2( ) ( 2) ( ( 1) ) ( )R Ih k D A B M C h k      ,

1( ) tan ( ) ( )I Rk h k h k  .

On the other hand, the CMA adopts the SGD 
to minimize the cost function 2 22{[| | ] }CMA nJ E y R  , 
where 4 22 [| | ] [| | ]R E s E s .  
Lemma 2: All of the CMA stationary points can be 
summarized as follows. (i) ( ) 0, 1,...,r k for k N  ; 
(ii) 2 ( ) ( ( 1)) ( 2 2 )s sr k B B C M k k M     , Mk I . 
The set of CMA stationary points for 1M   
can be obtained from ( ) 0CMAJ r k   . Clearly, the 
local minima of the CMA are located at 2 ( ) 1r k   
when M = 1. Moreover, the stationary points of the 
CMA are connected for each element of h  in 
contrast to the MMA with eight isolated stationary 
points for each element of h  [9]. One more major 
difference between the CMA and the MMA is their 
cost functions: a phase information term, related to 
the fourth-power phase estimator, 4[ ]E s , in other 
studies [16], exists in the MMA cost function, but is 
absent from the CMA cost function [9].  
 4
MMA [ 42 ( ) / sF A B C    or 42 ( ) / sE A B C    ] 
are referred to as the normalized equalization 
curvatures (NEC) hereafter. Similarly, the 
normalized curvatures corresponding to the phase 
tracking by the MMA [ 44 / sAF   or 44 / sAE  ] are 
referred to as the normalized phase curvatures 
(NPC). 
B. The Fourth-Order Statistics 4[ ]A E s  
The fourth-order statistics 4[ ]A E s  is known 
to have a crucial role in blind phase recovery [9], 
[12] (see also part (c) of Lemma 3). However, as 
indicated in Lemma 3, the fourth-order statistics A 
plays an important role in determining the MMA 
equalizer convergence rate as well (see part (a) of 
Lemma 3). The fourth-order statistics A is 
substantially affected by the mutual dependencies 
between Rs  and Is . When the distribution of a 
two-dimensional symmetric source s is 
sub-Gaussian and, moreover, Rs  and Is  are 
mutually independent, then 4 4[ ] ( 2)s sA E s k   
0  always. However, when Rs  and Is  are not 
mutually independent, then 2 2 2 2[ ] [ ] [ ]R I R IE s s E s E s  
4(1 4) s . Consequently, the normalized 
fourth-order statistics 4 4[ ] s sA E s k   
2 2 48 [ ]R I sE s s   can be shown to be greater than 
zero (or equivalently A > 0) in 4-PSK, V.29 [14], 
[11] and V.34 [15] modems, even though the 
distribution of s is still sub-Gaussian.  
C. Normalized Equalization Curvatures (NEC) of 
MMA and CMA 
 Based on the result of Lemma 3, when the 
MMA is used, two NEC, 42 ( ) / sF A B C    and 
42 ( ) / sE A B C    , at stationary points along 
3
2 2( ) 0, , , , Mk k I
     and along 
3 5 7
4 4 4 4( ) , , , , Mk k I
      , respectively, may 
jointly determine the rate of convergence of the 
( 1)M   non-zero components of h  with small 
modulus to the origin during the transient stage. 
Lemma 5 can be used to compute the average of the 
two NEC from Lemma 3 when the MMA is used. 
Lemma 5: If 0A  , then the average NEC of the 
error surface of the MMA may be approximated as 
[20] 
 4 0.50.51 1 1[2 ( )] ( 0.5) [2 ( )]

the average NEC of the error surface of the MMA 
may be approximated as

where

AF F A B C    . The average NEC, 
computed by either (4) or (5) will be used in the 
remainder of this report to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the removal of residual ISI by the 
MMA. Notably, when 0A  , the local minima are 
offset from the desired minima along 
3
2 2( ) 0, , ,k
   ; this offset can be accounted for a 
priori by simply rotating the MMA equalizer 
outputs by / 4  and then correcting their 
magnitudes by a normalization factor ( )D A B   
(see Lemma 1); the MMA can then still function 
properly. The second column of Table I lists the 
computed average NEC by the MMA for various 
constellations with M = 2, representative of 1M  , 
and may effectively reveal the ISI removal speed by 
the MMA during the transient stage. 
The NEC of the CMA is less complicated than 
that of the MMA and can be computed as 
4[(2 4) ]/s sk G  , according to Lemma 4. Figure 3 
compares the computed NEC of the CMA and the 
average NEC of the MMA using (4) for 
2,3,4,5M  , with square 256-QAM and cross 
128-QAM, both of which with A < 0. The third 
column of Table I presents the computed NEC by 
the CMA with M = 2, which may effectively reveal 
the ISI removal speed of the CMA during the 
transient stage. 
D. Normalized Phase Curvatures (NPC) of MMA 
The phase tracking of MMA mainly depends 
on either 44 / sAF   (if 0A  ) or 44 / sAE   (if 
0A  ), which is the NPC where the local minima 
are located, because the rate of phase tracking is 
determined by the rate of convergence of ( )h k  
with maximum modulus toward the global minima. 
Consequently, the NPC also has a critical role in 
determining the performance of the symbol error 
rate (SER) or the mean square error (MSE) of the 
MMA. Figure 4 compares the computed NPC by 
the MMA for 1,...,5M  , with various 
constellations, using either 44 / sAF   (if 0A  ) or 
44 / sAE   (if 0A  ). Notably, as M declines, the 
NPC become larger, which indicates that the phase 
tracking of MMA starts even at the beginning of the 
blind equalization process and becomes more 
effective as M decreases. The fourth column of 
Table I lists the computed NPC by the MMA with 
M = 2, representative of 1M  , and may 
effectively reveal the carrier phase tracking speed of 
the MMA once the MMA has started functioning 
 6
the same ensemble-averaged ISI in the steady state, 
such that the resulting steady-state SERs were less 
than 1% (or 10log 2SER   ). Consequently, the step 
size chosen for the CMA might differ from that for 
the MMA, even when the same constellation was 
used. 
A. CMA and MMA with 128-QAM and 256-QAM 
Figure 5 compares the simulation results of the 
CMA and the MMA in terms of ISI using both 
square 256-QAM and cross 128-QAM, while Fig. 6 
compares the simulation results between (CMA + 
PT) and the MMA in terms of SER, using the same 
signal constellations. Clearly, the NEC and the NPC 
of the MMA using cross 128-QAM are the smallest 
(in absolute value) among all of the curvatures 
displayed in Figs. 3 and 4, and so its equalizer 
convergence and phase tracking are substantially 
less effective than those of the CMA using both 
cross 128-QAM and 256-QAM and the MMA using 
256-QAM, as demonstrated in Figs. 5 and 6. The 
MMA using cross 128-QAM gives a small NEC 
and small NPC, because of its 0.181A   is much 
less than 0.605A   when the MMA is adopted 
with 256-QAM. Accordingly, cross QAM, such as 
cross 32-QAM and cross 128-QAM, should be 
avoided when the MMA is used. However, 
comparing the CMA (whose equalizer convergence 
rate depends solely on the source kurtosis sk ) 
using cross 128-QAM with CMA using 256-QAM 
indicates that the ISI convergence in the former 
case exceeds that in the latter case because the 
source kurtosis is greater in the latter case. 
For 256-QAM, although the NEC of CMA 
exceeds that of MMA as presented in Fig. 3, the 
simulation results in Fig. 5 indicate that the ISI 
performances of the CMA and the MMA are close, 
which result is typical for square 2 QAMn   
constellations with non-constant modulus. This 
result may follow from the fact that all of the CMA 
stationary points are located on a circle for each 
element of h  with connected stationary points, in 
contrast to the MMA, which has only eight isolated 
stationary points for each element of h , as 
indicated in Lemmas 1 and 2. Therefore, the MMA 
may have an advantage over the CMA in terms of 
the frequency of attraction toward the vicinity of the 
saddle points, around which it exhibits slow 
convergence, before converging to the desired 
minimum. However, as discussed earlier, the CMA 
may have an advantage over the MMA, in that the 
NEC of the former is larger than that of the latter in 
most cases when 0A  . On the other hand, when 
0A  , the NEC of the CMA may become smaller 
than that of the MMA (such as in V.29 and 4-PSK), 
because when 0A  , as Rs  and Is  depend more 
strongly on each other (such that the value of 
2 2 2 2[ ]/ [ ] [ ]R I R IE s s E s E s  becomes smaller), 
2 2 48 [ ]/s R I sA k E s s    increases with sk . Our 
simulation results demonstrated that either the 
MMA outperformed (CMA + CPRA) or both 
algorithms performed similarly in terms of SER 
performance for constellations with 0A  . To link 
readily the theoretical results of the NEC of both the 
MMA and the CMA, listed in Table I, with the 
corresponding ISI performances obtained from the 
simulations, we propose to subtract 0.25 from all of 
the NEC of the MMA listed in the second column 
of Table I to compensate for the lower frequency of 
attraction toward the saddle points when the MMA 
is employed than when the CMA is employed. For 
example, the NEC of the MMA using 256-QAM 
is –1.951 after 0.25 was subtracted from –1.701, 
presented in the second column of Table I. 
B. Other Constellations 
Consider three modified 128-QAM 
constellations, 128A-COB, 128B-COB and 
128C-COB proposed by Cartwright [19] to improve 
the performance of the fourth power phase 
estimator of the cross 128-QAM. Table I indicates 
that the NPC of the three modified constellations 
using both the CMA and the MMA indeed markedly 
exceed that of the cross 128-QAM. However, the 
NEC of the three modified constellations using the 
CMA become smaller than that of cross 128-QAM, 
implying that the use of the three modified 
constellations with (CMA + CPRA) may gain 
significant phase tracking speed by sacrificing some 
of the equalizer convergence rate. The sacrifice of 
the equalizer convergence rate becomes 
unnecessary when the MMA is adopted with the 
three modified 128-QAM constellations (Table I). 
In particular, the MMA with 128A-COB yields not 
only a larger NEC but also a much larger NPC than 
MMA with the cross 128-QAM, as presented in 
Table I. Accordingly, the MMA with 128A-COB 
provided the best SER performance, as displayed in 
Fig. 8, despite the fact that the ISI convergence was 
fastest when the CMA was used with cross 
128-QAM (because it has a fairly large NEC shown 
in Table I), as presented in Fig. 7. The MMA with 
128A-COB outperformed (CMA + PT) with cross 
128-QAM in terms of SER because the NPC of the 
latter is much smaller than that of the former. 
Notably, (CMA + PT) with 128C-COB also yielded
