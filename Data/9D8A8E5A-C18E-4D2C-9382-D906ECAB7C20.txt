The approach by genetic engineering closely relies on the use of plasmids and is commonly 
afflicted by the potential problem of plasmid instability and safety concern. In this work, these 
issues were addressed by metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for production of 
intermediate metabolites in aromatic pathway. By flux analysis, the pathway mode leading to 
maximal production yield was simplified with identification of key reaction steps. Making use of 
the developed methods for gene deletion and chromosomal insertion of genes, E. coli genome 
was manipulated free of antibiotic markers to redirect the pathway flux. Associated with the 
elimination of competing pathways, the rate-limiting steps were enhanced to supply precursor 
metabolites. As a consequence of zwf removal, it led the pathway flux to the destined path where 
quinic acid, gallic acid, and shikimic acid were accumulated. The result indicates the zwf as the 
critical node for redirection of carbon flux in this case.  Overall, this study clearly illustrates the 
promise of the proposed methods for efficient manipulation of E. coli genome to alter its 
physiological trait.

To tackle the above-mentioned problems, we have recently developed a series of integration 
plasmids for genomic insertion of native or foreign genes into the phage attachment site (Chiang 
et al. 2008). Based on the CRIM plasmids with a conditional-replication origin (Haldimann and 
Wanner 2001), these integration plasmids were constructed by bracketing the multiple cloning 
site (MCS) and a phage attachment (attP) locus (for phage λ, HK022, φ80, P21, and P22) with 
the FRT site. With the aid of a helper plasmid expressing the phage integrase (Int), these plasmids 
carrying the cargo genes can be integrated into their respective bacterial attachment (attB) site in 
single copy. As illustrated, the insertion efficiency of these integration plasmids was extremely 
high and integrants were highly stable as well. In addition, this approach is particularly attractive 
because it allows the site-specific insertion of DNAs into E. coli genome and later elimination of 
replicons (the self-replicating DNA fragments) and selective markers.  
As a proof of principle, in this study the metabolic pathway of E. coli was engineered with 
the developed method for directing the carbon flux to the committed pathway leading to aromatic 
amino acids. Associated with the removal of competing pathways by a newly explored method, 
the adopted strategy was to enhance the rate-limiting steps and to redirect the carbon flux to 
precursors. As a consequence, the pathway flux was channeled to the destination in the way as 
planned. A large amount of intermediate metabolites including quinic acid, gallic acid, and 
shikimic acid were found to accumulate in the cell. This result clearly indicates the promise of 
this method for efficient manipulation of E. coli genome to alter its physiological trait. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
 
2.1. Bacterial Strains and culturing condition 
Manipulation of DNAs was routinely conducted in E. coli strain DH5α(pir) (deoR endA1 
gyrA96 hsdR17 supE44 thi1 recA1 lacZM15 λpir) whereas strain BL21 (DE3) was engineered for 
the experiments. Recombinant strains were grown in shake flasks containing M9 mineral medium 
(Miller 1972) supplemented with 2% glucose while their growth was monitored turbidimetrically 
at 550 nm (OD550). Recombinant cells were grown for overnight and seeded to have an initial cell 
density of 0.1 at OD550. The culture was maintained in an orbital shaker set at 200 rpm and 37?. 
Upon reaching 0.4 at OD550, the cells were induced by adding 50 µM IPTG.

2.4. Deletion of chromosomal genes  
Strains carrying pK-HT (Herring and Blattner 2004) were grown in LB medium (Miller 
1972) with 0.2% L–rhamnose to trigger the production of λ-Red recombinase at 30?. After 
reaching OD550 of 0.6, the cells were made electrocompetent by concentrating 100-fold and 
washing two times with ice-cold 10% glycerol. For deletion of ldhA, two megaprimers were 
synthesized from E. coli genome using two primer sets, RC0681-RC0682 and RC0683-RC-0684. 
Followed by overlapping PCR, the targeting DNA was generated by two megaprimers to prime 
the template plasmid pCm-ISc. After purification, the targeting DNA (100 ng) was electroporated 
into competent cells and the electro-shocked cells were then incubated in SOC medium at 37? 
for 2 h. The resulting cells were spread onto selective LB medium with the selection for 
chloramphenicol resistance at 37?. Meanwhile, two megaprimers were spliced by using PCR to 
produce the patch DNA. One integrant was made electro-competent and subsequently 
transformed with the patch DNA. The electro-shocked cells were then incubated in SOC medium 
with 0.01% tetracycline (for production of I-SceI) and 0.2% L–rhamnose at 37? for 2 h. Spread 
onto selective LB medium, strains were examined with the selection for chloramphenicol 
sensitivity (indicating loss of marker) and ampicillin sensitivity (loss of pK-HT). Similarly, the 
ackA gene was eliminated in the same way but using the primer set, RC0685-RC0686 and 
RC0687-RC-0688. 
 
2.5. Analytical Methods  
  Glucose was measured by glucose assay kit (Sigma Co.). For analysis of fermentation products, 
high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used using the LiChrosorb RP-18 column 
(YMC Tech.) with a mobile phase containing 6 mM H3PO4 (pH 2.1) pumped at 1 mL/min. The 
eluate was then monitored at 210 nm and at 70 ?. Alternatively, the YMC-Pack ODS-AQ 
column (YMC Tech.) was employed with a mobile phase containing 20 mM H3PO4 /NaH2PO4 
(pH 2.8). The eluate pumped at 0.7 mL/min was detected at 220 nm and at 30 ?.

it produces the targeting DNA consisting of the marker gene bracketed with I-SceI sites 
(ISceI-Cm-ISceI) and two homology extensions. After purification, the targeting DNA is 
electro-transformed into a host strain with the helper plasmid pK-HT which provides the λ-Red 
recombinases upon induction by L-rhamnose (Herring and Blattner 2004). Integrants exhibiting 
resistance to the antibiotic are then examined for the inserted DNA using in situ PCR with 
primers Pm1-Pm4. Subsequently adding L-rhamnose and tetracycline, the λ-Red recombinases 
and I-SceI protein are triggered to produce from pK-HT in the integrant. The marker in the 
inserted DNA is removed by the I-SceI digestion. In parallel, the two synthetic megaprimers are 
joined by PCR (called the patch DNA) and introduced into the host cell by electro-transformation. 
With the aid of the λ-Red recombinases, the gap left in the genome post the I-SceI cleavage is 
therefore repaired by the patch DNA fragment. The resulting transformants are screened for 
showing sensitivity to antibiotic (indicating the marker removal and the loss of pK-HT) after 
exposure to heat. Finally, the event of the gene disruption is verified by PCR using primers 
Pm1-Pm4. 
 On the basis of the protocol outlined above, both ldhA and ackA genes were then eliminated. 
Using pCm-ISc as the template, primers RC0681-0684 and RC0685-0688 (Table 1) were used to 
synthesize the gene fusion consisting of the ISceI-Cm-ISceI
 
cassette sandwiched by the truncated 
parts of ldhA and ackA, respectively. After transformation of the linear DNA into E. coli strain 
BL21(DE3) bearing pK-HT, integrants showing resistance to chloramphenicol were selected and 
confirmed by PCR using primer RC0681-RC0684 (Fig. 3a) and RC0685-RC0688 (Fig. 3b). Later 
removal of the marker by the patch DNA was verified by PCR, and the resulting strain was 
designated BL21-1. 
 
3.3. Enhanced activity of key metabolic steps 
 As revealed by the flux analysis (Fig. 1), at least 4 key reaction steps were identified and 
required to be enhanced, including aroF, tktA, talB, and ppsA. The enzymatic act of ppsA 
functions to redirect pyruvate back to PEP, a pivot step aimed at increasing the precursor pool and 
the production yield.  
To up-regulate the expression of these genes, our developed method based on the integration 
vectors was employed for chromosomal insertion of target genes into phage attachment sites 
(Chiang et al. 2008). As described, tktA and talB under control of the T7 promoter were 
 10 
along the time course. As shown in Fig. 5a, the final cell density for two experimental strains was 
lower than the control strain BL21-1. The result also showed that the control strain consumed 
glucose more rapidly (Fig. 5c), indicating that PTS is more efficient than glf for glucose transport. 
In particular, strain BL21-FZ grew relatively slow but was able to produce quinic acid, galic acid, 
and, to a less extent, shikimic acid (Fig. 5b). Strain BL21-F, however, produced only quinic acid 
whereas these metabolites were absent for the control strain (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, it was found 
that both the control strain and strain BL21-F capable of accumulating pyruvate as the 
fermentation product (Fig. 5c).      
 
4. Discussion  
Strongly relying on the use of plasmids, genetic engineering appears to be a very powerful 
tool to manipulate cells for desired traits. However, it leads to the problem of plasmid burden 
which ultimately alters the host cell physiology and discourages the engineering purpose 
(Birnbaum and Bailey 1991; Martinez-Morales et al. 1999). In addition, the free release of 
plasmids containing the antibiotic marker and the replicon would certainly raise an environmental 
concern. In this study, these issues were addressed by using the developed methods for genomic 
gene deletion and the controlled expression of target genes completely free of replicons and 
markers. For gene knockout, the method lies in the use of I-SceI for the removal of the marker, 
leaving no scars in the genome (Fig. 2). Unlike FLP, one FRT site is left behind after 
recombination. Indeed, it is undesirable to have the extra FRT sites remained in the genome due 
to their interference with the target FRT sites for action by FLP. Without residing in plasmids, 
genes of interest regulated by their unnatural promoter were all incorporated into the bacterial 
genome using the conditional-replication integration vectors. In contrast to the commonly used 
transposons (de Lorenzo and Timmis 1994), genes are randomly integrated into the chromosomal 
locus, which creates the inserted DNAs in the form of replicons and transposable elements 
associated with selective markers. This will complicate subsequent constructions when cycling 
improvements are required. As illustrated here, the integration method allows the site-specific and 
repeated insertion of genes and offers many advantages for applications.   
Aromatic compounds derived from the aromatic pathway are of great commercial 
importance. For instance, shikimic acid has been utilized as the starting material for the 
manufacture of Tamiflu, an orally effective antiinfluenza agent. It also provides a core scaffold

5. Conclusion  
As with this successful illustration, it is conceived that the proposed methods can be 
extended to the other metabolite production where a clean production process is particularly 
concerned.
