loss time constant in this model. In our work, we 
utilize our trap model to compare the charge 
retention characteristics between the devices 
with/without PMA treatment. We suggest the 
defects or surface states around Ge NCs are 
annealed out with PMA treatment, resulting in 
smaller amount of communication of charges 
between NCs/traps and caused by the reduction 
of conductive paths. The recover of these defects 
are belong to the shallow traps. During PMA 
treatment, the shallow traps in the oxide are 
annealed out, resulting in reduction of trap 
capacitance and trap conductance but the charge 
retention is not obviously improved due to the 
charges storing in the deeper traps or deeper 
potential well. 
 
二、計畫的緣由與目的 
   Conventional Flash memories have the 
scaling limitations. The most prominent one 
today is the limited potential for continued 
scaling of the device structure. This scaling 
limitation from the isolation layers thickness, in 
particular the tunnel oxide layer. The aggressive 
scaling of gate dielectric is incompatible with the 
need to preserve minimum dielectric thickness in 
flash devices to maintain oxide reliability.  On 
the other hand, the tunnel oxide needs to provide 
superior isolation under retention in order to 
maintain the data information over periods of up 
ten years. However, flash memory cells designed 
for ten years data retention requiring the use of 
thick tunnel oxide that compromise both its write 
and erase speed. Nonvolatile memory devices 
using nanocrystals (NCs) as a floating gate (FG) 
have received considerable attention because of 
its excellent memory performance and high 
scalability. As compared to conventionally 
stacked-gate NVM devices, in a nanocrystal 
NVM device charge is not stored on a 
continuous FG poly-Si layer, but instead on a 
layer of discrete, mutually isolated, crystalline 
nanocrystals or｀dots＇to reduce the problems 
of charge loss encountered in conventional flash 
memories, allowing for thinner injection 
tunneling oxides without sacrificing 
nonvolatility and, hence, smaller operating 
voltages, better endurance, and faster write/erase 
speeds because stored charges can be less 
sensitive to local oxide defects and the spacing 
between the dots suppresses the charge loss 
through lateral path. 
Compared to Si, Ge has a narrower band 
gap to provide superior retention time, and has 
high thermal condensation ability during high 
temperature process. Otherwise, the formation of 
Ge nanocrystals is compatible to the typical 
CMOS process. Y.-C. King et al. proposed a 
technique of Ge NCs formation in gate dielectric 
of a MOSFET through a sequence of thermal 
oxidation of Si1-xGex at various temperature 
followed by high-temperature annealing [1]. 
Besides, the Ge NCs are usually formed by 
various other methods, such as a rapid thermal 
annealing (RTA) of co-sputtering Ge +SiO2 layer 
[2], Ge implantation into SiO2 films [3], H2 
reduction of Si1-xGexO2 or Ge-oxide [4], 
ultra-thin electron-beam evaporated Ge layer 
embedded in SiO2 [5]. Thus co-sputtering allows 
one to vary the Ge content in a vary broad range. 
Ion implantation allows incorporating more Ge 
species into the SiO2, but makes some damage in 
SiO2 matrix. For previous fabrication methods, it 
is difficult to control the thickness of the 
tunneling and control oxide layer, as well as the 
density and size of the Ge NCs. Recently, Ge 
inch. Therefore the heat can melt any refractory 
materials. The hearth which holds the evaporate 
materials is water-cooled to keep from 
overheating and melting.  
   In our work, one of the advantages that we 
use E-gun evaporator to form Ge NCs is not 
expensive compared to UHV/CVD system and 
easily try different size of Ge NCs from various 
thicknesses of the evaporated amorphous Ge 
films. The fabrication process of Ge NCs using 
the E-gun system is as follows: Firstly, a rapid 
thermal oxide (RTO) layer with a thickness of 3 
nm is grown on a p-type Si substrate followed by 
RCA clean. Next, the sample and the crucible 
with pure Ge granules (99.999%) are loaded in 
the chamber in the E-gun evaporator system. 
When the pressure of the chamber is lower than 
1E-4 Pa, the vacuum for evaporation is ready. 
Because the melting point of Ge is around 
~938oC, we increase the current to make the Ge 
granules melting. Then, an amorphous Ge (a-Ge) 
layer is deposited on the RTO layer by E-gun 
evaporation. Ge is evaporated at a rate of about 
0.1 Åsec-1. The z-ratio of Ge is 0.516 and the 
density is 5.4 g/cm3. After the a-Ge layer 
deposition, we evaporate titanium (Ti) ~1000 Å 
to coverage the a-Ge near the crucible in order to 
prevent the Ge evaporating to contaminate the 
non-Si based sample in the next evaporation due 
to the thermal radiation. Finally, a SiO2 layer 
(~40 nm) is capped on the a-Ge layer by the 
PECVD system as the control oxide. The 
three-layer structure (tunnel SiO2/RTO/ a-Ge 
layer/Capping SiO2) is then heated by furnace 
annealing treatment in a dry N2 ambient at 900oC 
for 300 seconds. This thermal treatment is called 
“PDA.” The PDA treatment is in order to form 
well-separated Ge NCs. 
三、研究方法及成果 
In our work for Ge NCs fabrication using 
the UHV/CVD system and E-gun evaporator, we 
observer these device structure characteristics 
under various growth conditions, such as the 
growth temperature and durations for 
UHV/CVD system and the thickness of the 
evaporated a-Ge films followed by PDA 
treatment for E-gun evaporation. These results 
about the dot size and density obtained from the 
SEM and HRTEM images.  
    It is shown the Ge NCs deposited by 
UHV/CVD system do not penetrate through the 
tunnel oxide after the PDA treatment at high 
temperature. Figure 1 shows the SEM images 
taken from the Ge NCs formation deposited by 
UHV/CVD. A series of experiments are 
investigated in such conditions shown as caption 
of Fig. 1. The size of the Ge NCs is clearly larger 
as the growth duration increased (shown as 
Figure 1). We adjust the growth temperature and 
duration to obtain the maximum dot density to 
be 1.8 × 1010 cm-2. Compare to Figure 1 (c) and 
(d), we observe the size of Ge NCs grown at 
600oC is almost larger than that at 550oC due to 
the faster growth rate at higher growth 
temperature.

2.5 V and then held at this voltage for 30s before 
returning to -3 V. The hold time ensures that the 
structure are fully charged or discharged by the 
holding bias before commencement of the 
voltage sweep. From the results of C-V curve, 
we observe the width of the hysteresis decreases 
significantly from the as-deposited sample to the 
950oC-annealing sample at the same sweep bias 
range.  We suggest the Ge NCs of the 
as-deposited sample have interfacial states or 
bulk deep traps to capture the electrons or holes. 
For the 800oC-annealing sample, the presence of 
unstable thermodynamically GeOx results in the 
critical charge loss. Compare to as-deposited 
sample and 800oC annealing sample, it is shown 
the hole trapping effect is decreased during 
annealing. As to 950oC annealing sample, it 
indicates there is no hysteresis effect. After the 
high temperature annealing up to 950oC, the 
disappearance of the Ge-O bonds exhibits the 
improvement of the oxide quality. Also, the 
original interface states and bulk defects were 
annealed out. Maybe this is one of the reasons 
why there is no charge trapping in the high 
temperature annealing samples.

grown for 120 min with as-deposited, 800oC-annealing and 
950oC-annealing sample. 
 On the other hand, The fabrication process 
of Ge NCs using the E-gun system is as follows: 
The sample is fabricated by thermally grown 
3nm-thick dry SiO2 layer as a tunneling oxide on 
p-type (100) silicon substrate at 950oC after 
standard RCA recipes. Then, a Ge (a-Ge) layer is 
deposited on the SiO2 layer by E-gun 
evaporation. The following 40nm control oxide 
layer is grown by plasma enhanced chemical 
vapor deposition (PECVD). The three-layer 
structure (tunnel SiO2/Ge layer/Capping SiO2) is 
then heated by furnace annealing treatment in a 
dry N2 ambient at 950oC for 300 seconds. This 
treatment is in order to form well-separated Ge 
NCs. Last, 300nm Al contacts are deposited on 
both front and back surface to complete the gate 
stack formation of MOS capacitor. After 
evaporation, the sample is annealed at 4500C in 
either pure N2 or forming gas (90%N2+10%H2) 
ambient as post-metallization-anneal (PMA) to 
investigate the effects of interface traps and 
defects inducing from the nanocrystals 
fabrication process. 
A cross-sectional TEM micrograph of a 
control oxide/Ge thin layer/tunnel oxide stack 
structure is shown in Fig. 4(a). From lack of 
lattice fringes shown in the inset of Fig.4(a),the 
Ge layer appears amorphous, as expected for an 
electron gun evaporated Ge film on room 
temperature. From TEM images, the thickness of 
Ge layer is about 4.5 nm. After annealing 
treatment at 950oC for 300 seconds in a dry N2 
ambient, the crystalline Ge nanocrystals are 
formed in SiO2 matrix shown in Fig. 4 (b). The 
lattice fringes is obviously shown in the inset 
images, which indicates the crystallization of the 
whole amorphous layer at 950oC annealing 
provides the enough thermal energy to

 A post-metallization annealing (PMA) is 
performed on both the devices for 300 seconds at 
400oC in a N2 ambient. The sample of 1934 A 
with PMA treatment is called “1934 B”, 
respectively. Figure 6 shows the hysteresis of 
C-V relation in the evaporated Ge NCs devices 
with PMA treatment. An improvement of the 
stretch-out phenomenon in the C-V curves is 
observed on these two devices indicating 
possible passivation of interfacial traps between 
Ge NCs and surrounding oxide. Therefore, the 
PMA process reduces the interface states density 
and passivation of some dangling bonds in 
tri-layer structures. We suggest that the 
interfacial traps between Ge NCs and 
surrounding oxide is very close to the Si 
substrate observed from HRTEM images 
because evaporated Ge atoms aggressive each 
other and then ripens to form spherical-like Ge 
NCs during post-deposition annealing. The 
distance of Ge NCs and Si substrate becomes 
smaller than 3 nm. However, the window of 
hysteresis is not decreased by PMA treatment. 
This indicates the main mechanism of trapping 
electrons or holes is not due to the interfacial 
traps.  
Figure 6  High frequency C-V characteristics of evaporated Ge NCs 
embedded in MOS capacitor for 1934 B samples.  
In order to further understand the involved 
shallow traps, the C-V, G-V technique with 
different frequencies is used to measure the 
devices since the associated trap characteristic is 
frequency-dependent. The frequency-dependent 
C-V and G-V characteristics are measured at 
frequency between 50KHz and 1000KHz with a 
small-amplitude (50mV) sine-wave voltage (AC) 
signal and the DC bias ranging from -10V to 10V. 
The measured apparent capacitance (Cm) and 
parallel apparent conductance (Gm) over the 
angular frequency (ω=2πf) versus the gate 
voltage with different frequency are shown in the 
top and bottom plots of Figs. 7(a) and (b) for 
Samples 1934A and 1934B which are directly 
obtained by HP 4284 A LCR meter respectively. 
It is seen that the Cm and Gm both shift towards 
much more positive bias for Sample 1934A than 
1934B. In addition, the Gm magnitude is 
suppressed by PMA treatment for Sample B, 
especially at low frequency. It is also attributed 
to PMA treatment curing the traps and reducing 
the leakage current.    
In addition, strong measured conductance 
peak close to the flat band voltage are also 
observed during the Gm-V measurement in 
bottom data of Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively, 
corresponding to the respective Cm-V curves 
while the Gm-V curves of sample A are 
strench-out relating to Cm-V curves, the Gm-V 
curves of sample B are comparatively sharp, 
showing the existence of tunneling paths results 
in exchange of charges with AC signal between 
traps and Si substrate. The peak of Gm-V curves 
are shifted according to flat band voltage shift of 
Cm-V curves. And the peak shifting is considered 
as different traps states throughout the silicon

To extract the trap admittance, the real series 
resistance (Rs) of MOS devices is subtracted 
from the measured capacitance (Cma) and 
conductance (Gma) in strong accumulation region. 
The oxide capacitance (Cox) is found as 
maximum capacitance in strong accumulation 
region at the given frequency. [12] Eliminating 
the Rs and Cox effect, the equivalent parallel 
capacitance (Cp) shunted with the equivalent 
parallel conductance (Gp) are obtained. The Cp 
consists of the depletion layer capacitance (Cd) 
and the trap capacitance (CT) can be expressed 
parallel as Cp= Cd + CT. Also, the trap 
conductance, GT is the same as the equivalent 
parallel conductance Gp=GT. At enough high 
frequency (~1000KHz), it is assumed that the 
contribution of trap capacitance to the total 
capacitance is negligibly small because charges 
exchange between NCs/traps and Si substrate 
cannot follow the AC signal approximately. 
Consequently, at 1000KHz the trap capacitance, 
CT(ω) is determined as CT = 0 for reference state. 
In addition, the deep trap contribute to the 
capacitance is also disregarded due to its 
maintaining the same hysteresis windows under 
various measured frequency. So under these 
assumptions, the depletion layer capacitance is 
approximately subtracted from 1000KHz 
measured capacitance.

or trapped in the devices varies with the 
thickness of a-Ge thin films. The larger coverage 
rate of Ge NCs on tunnel oxide surface which 
results from thick a-Ge thickness causes the 
larger amount of charges stored in the devices. 
Comparison between the devices with PMA 
treatment and without PMA treatment, the 
devices with PMA treatment shows better 
retention characteristic of and lower charge loss 
rate.  
We also propose a single trap model based 
on SRH theory by introducing another charge 
loss time constant in this model. In our work, we 
utilize our trap model to compare the charge 
retention characteristics between the devices 
with/without PMA treatment. From the measured 
admittance, we extract the values of trap 
capacitance and trap conductance. Trap 
capacitance in the device without PMA treatment 
is larger than that with PMA treatment. We 
suggest the defects or surface states around Ge 
NCs are annealed out by PMA treatment, 
resulting in smaller amount of communication of 
charges between NCs/traps caused by the 
reduction of conductive paths. In addition, the 
amount of trap conductance is also reduced. The 
charge loss time constant for the devices with 
PMA treatment is larger than that for the device 
without PMA treatment due to the reduction of 
surface state density or oxide defectd around Ge 
NCs caused by PMA treatment, resulting in the 
suppression of trap-assisted tunneling through 
the tunnel oxide to decrease the charge loss 
behavior. During PMA treatment, the shallow 
traps in the oxide are annealed out, resulting in 
reduction of trap capacitance and trap 
conductance but the charge retention is not 
obviously improved due to the charges storing in 
the deeper traps or deeper potential well.
