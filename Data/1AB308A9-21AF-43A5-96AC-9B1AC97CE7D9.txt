1. Introduction
When a conducting media under the combined actions of mechanical and electromagnetic ﬁelds, there
occur various interacting eﬀects in the media (Nye, 1957; Solymar, 1984; Kong, 1990). If the mechanical
responses are of primary interest, the problem may be formulated on the basis of Maxwells equations of
electromagnetism and equations of elasticity in which the Lorentz force due to the electromagnetic eﬀects
is included, together with the constitutive relations that characterize the material properties of the mediaReceived 8 April 2005; received in revised form 31 May 2005

Abstract
Connection between electromagnetoelasticity and anisotropic elasticity is explored in the state space setting. In the
absence of electric charges and currents, the basic equations of static electromagnetoelasticity are formulated into a
state equation and an output equation, which bear a remarkable resemblance to the corresponding equations of elas-
ticity. Accordingly, the solutions for various steady-state problems of electromagnetoelasticity can be determined in
parallel to their elastic counterparts. For illustration, the generalized plane problems are treated within the context.
Exact solutions for the electromagnetoelastic ﬁelds in a half-space subjected to line loads and in an inﬁnite plate with
an elliptic notch under extension are determined in a simple way.Connection between static electromagnetoelasticity
and anisotropic elasticity and its applications

ersome to deal with the ﬁeld variables and material constants individually.The strain–displacement relations are
eij ¼ ðui;j þ uj;iÞ=2; ð7Þ
where ui are the displacement components.
The equations of equilibrium are

For a 3D problem of a generally anisotropic material, there are 72 independent material constants and
29 ﬁeld variables (three displacements, six strains, six stresses, three electric displacements, three electric
ﬁelds, three magnetic ﬁelds, and three magnetic ﬂuxes, three electromagnetic potentials) in total. Eqs.s. (1)–(3) encompass the constitutive equations for linear elasticity, piezoelectricity, and electromag-
of anisotropic media. Setting eijk = qijk = 0, Eq. (1) becomes the constitutive equations of aniso-
elastic materials without polarization and magnetization; Eqs. (2) and (3) the constitutive
ions of electromagnetic materials (Kong, 1990). Setting qijk = dik = 0, Eqs. (1) and (2) become the con-
ive equations of piezoelectric materials (Nye, 1957); Eq. (3) the constitutive equations of magnetic
ials.

electromagnetoelasticity can be treated as well following the same line.
The connection between static electromagnetoelasticity and anisotropic elasticity has been found by
grouping the ﬁeld variables properly and partitioning the constitutive matrix accordingly. In the formula-
tion we have grouped the ﬁeld variables in such a manner that the derivatives with respect to x2 are taken to
the left-hand side of the state equation. The way of grouping is not unique. For other groupings the forms
of the state equation and output equation remain unchanged, only the matrices Cab and Ki need to be rede-
ﬁned. It has been shown in the state space formalism for anisotropic elasticity (Tarn, 2002a) that an alter-
native formulation based on grouping the stresses into inplane and antiplane components results in a state
equation and an output equation diﬀerent in form but same in eﬀect. The statement stands in the present
case.

6. Concluding remarks
We have formulated the basic equations of static electromagnetoelasticity in the state space setting andAgain, by setting eij = qij = 0, k = 1–3, and qij = lij = 0, k = 1–4, respectively, the solutions of the associ-
ated problems of anisotropic elasticity (Lekhnitskii, 1981) and piezoelectricity (Tarn, 2002c) are recovered.
In closing, we note that a series solution for the problem may be found, following the same line as given
in Lekhnitskii (1981), by representing the analytic functions in the exterior of a unit circle in the n plane in
the form of Laurents series

pendent of the elastic deformation, the problem may be solved by determining ﬁrst the temperature distribu-
tion in the solid from the equations of heat conduction and then the thermal stresses from the equations of
elasticity in which the temperature change is incorporated as a known function (Boley and Weiner, 1960).
When the temperature changes due to the elastic deformation cannot be neglected, it is necessary to determine
the thermal and mechanical ﬁelds in the body concurrently. It is well known that the classical theory of ther-
moelasticity (Nowacki, 1975, 1986) rests upon the hypothesis of the Fourier law of heat conduction, in which
the temperature distribution is governed by a parabolic-type partial diﬀerential equation. As a consequence,
the theory predicts that a thermal signal is felt instantaneously everywhere in a body. This implies an inﬁnite
speed of propagation of the thermal signal and is unrealistic from the physical point of view, especially forA state space formalism for generalized anisotropic thermoelasticity accounting for thermomechanical coupling and
thermal relaxation is developed, which includes the classical thermoelasticity as a special case. By properly grouping
the ﬁeld variables using matrix notations, the basic equations of thermoelasticity are formulated into a state equation
and an output equation in terms of the state vector. To obtain the solution for a speciﬁc problem it suﬃces to solve
the state equation under the prescribed conditions. For weak thermomechanical coupling an asymptotic solution can
be obtained by using the method of perturbation with multiple scales. Propagation of plane harmonic thermoelastic waves
in an anisotropic medium is studied within the context.

c 1on generalized thermoelasticity converge to constant values. The observation agrees with the results by letting
k!1 in Eq. (26). In addition, the attenuation rates of the mechanical modes based on coupled thermoelas-
ticity and generalized thermoelasticity vanish as the wave number k tends to inﬁnity. Since the thermal wave is
absent according to coupled thermoelasticity, Fig. 6 presents only the phase velocity of c7 based on generalized
thermoelasticity. Fig. 7 shows that the attenuation of the thermal mode based on coupled thermoelasticity
tends to inﬁnity as the wave number increases. This is not the case for generalized thermoelasticity. Since
the thermomechanical coupling is weak,  being of the order 102, the results based on coupled thermoelas-
ticity and generalized thermoelasticity are very close within the order 103, suggesting the thermal relaxation is
insigniﬁcant in this case.
In order to examine the performance of the asymptotic analysis, we have computed the results for an iso-
tropic material and an orthotropic material with assumed material properties. For the isotropic material we
assume Poisson’s ratio m = 0.3 and the other material constants being normalized to unit through nondimen-
sionalization according to Eq. (13). For the orthotropic material we assume EL = 25ET, GLT = 0.5ET,
GTT = 0.2ET, mLT = mTT = 0.25, aT = 3aL, kL = 3kT, where the subscripts L and T indicate the longitudinal

mental determination of the lamina properties and exact solutions are useful in developing a numerical model.
While the subject of stress analysis of composite laminates has been under continual study, to the authors’
knowledge, hardly any exact solution for problems of anisotropic multilayered laminates subjected to exten-
sion, twisting, and bending has been found. Exact analysis of stress ﬁelds in composite laminates is diﬃcult in
that the interfacial continuity conditions and the free-edge boundary conditions are not easy to satisfy exactly.
It is well known that the classical lamination theory (CLT) and its variants (Jones, 1975; Christensen, 1979)
based on assumed displacements through the thickness are unsuitable for interlaminar stress analysis as they
fail to satisfy the requirements of interfacial traction continuity and traction-free boundary conditions at the
free edges. In a rigorous analysis of composite laminates, it was often found necessary to relax either the exactA class of problems of composite laminates and functionally graded materials (FGM) under extension, twisting, and
bending is formulated in the state space setting. A solution approach for exact analysis of the deformation and stress ﬁelds
in the media is developed. Exact solutions for torsion of cross-ply laminates and certain FGM are derived, which satisfy
exactly the equations of anisotropic elasticity, the end conditions, the traction-free boundary conditions on the bounding
planes of the rectangular section, and the interfacial continuity conditions in multilayered composite laminates, regardless
of the number of layers. The solutions serve as useful benchmarks for numerical modeling and material characterization of
composite laminates and FGM.

H.-H. Chang, J.-Q. Tarn / International Journal of Solids and Structures 44 (2007) 1409–1422 1411The problem under study is a composite laminate of rectangular section subjected to an axial force, a
torque, and bi-axial bending moments at the end sections. As shown in Fig. 1, the origin of the Cartesian coor-
dinates is located at the center of the bottom plane. The free-edge boundaries and the end sections are deﬁned
by x1 = ± a/2 and x3 = 0, l, respectively. The x2-axis is pointing in the thickness direction such that the top
and bottom planes and the interfaces between adjacent layers are deﬁned by x2 = constant.
In formulating Eqs. (3) and (4) into a state equation and an output equation it is important to choose judi-

FGM with material nonhomogeneity varying exponentially through the thickness. The state space approach
makes it easier for an exact analysis of the deformations and stress ﬁelds in general composite laminates in
which inplane and antiplane deformations are coupled. The mathematics in the solution process is of course
more involved.
For a general variation of the nonhomogeneity the state equation is non-uniform with a variable system
matrix, which is not solvable in a closed form. To resolve the problem, the variations of the material properties
through the thickness can be approximated by piecewise-constant functions so that the state equation becomes
uniform with constant system matrix in the sub-intervals and thus is solvable by using the method of matrix
algebra. The scheme amounts to approximating the nonhomogeneous plate by a laminate composed of homo-
geneous layers. The continuity conditions at the jumps of the ﬁctitious layers are satisﬁed by using the transfer
matrix. The accuracy of the piecewise-constant approximation naturally depends on the number of layers
taken, but this should not be a problem as the use of transfer matrix involves only straightforward operations.

signiﬁcance of the end eﬀects through an exact analysis
of heat conduction in circular cylinders of functionally
graded materials (FGM) and laminated composites sub-
jected to 2D thermal loads and arbitrary end conditions.
Solutions of heat conduction have been obtained, by

state space approach [5,6] for radially inhomogeneous,
cylindrically anisotropic circular cylinders. Based on
the approach, the eigensolution for a laminated system
is determined by simple manipulation of 2 · 2 matrices,
regardless of the number of layers.
It is known that the solution for a ﬁnite cylinder sub-
jected to 2D thermal loads with prescribed end conditions
may be determined by superposing the solutions for two
fundamental problems: the ﬁrst one is a 2D problem of an1. Introduction
When a cylindrical prismatic body is subjected to
thermal loads that do not vary axially, the problem of
heat conduction may be formulated as 2D provided that
the temperature and heat ﬂux over the end surfaces are
speciﬁed in the same way as those in every other cross
system a conventional approach is to express the ﬁeld
equations in terms of temperature and solve the govern-
ing equation for each layer, and then impose the interfa-
cial continuity and boundary conditions (BC) to obtain
the solution. Following this layerwise approach, one has
to deal with the unpleasant task of determining the

The ﬁrst few eigenvalues of the hollow cylinder for
various a/b and l are given in Tables 1 and 2. The
numerical results for l = 0, a/b = 0.9 agree well with
those obtained according to Eq. (24). The value of l
has little inﬂuence on a thin-walled tube. This is ex-
pected because the radial inhomogeneity through a short
thickness of a thin-walled tube generally should not
exhibit marked variation. The eﬀects of radial inhomo-
geneity and cylindrical anisotropy are insigniﬁcant for

l = 0;0.5) under the T–T BC, the decay length is about
3.5b. In this case, the signiﬁcance of the end eﬀects de-
pends on the length–diameter ratio of the cylinder.
Figs. 1 and 2 show the decay length with respect to
the wall thickness of a homogeneous hollow cylinder
(l = 0) and a radially inhomogeneous one (l = 5) under
various BC. The decay length for the cylinder under the
F–F BC is inﬁnite and is not shown in the ﬁgure. In the
case of the F–T BC, the decay length depends on the
decay length of a hollow cylinder with a wall thickness
nated composites under 2D thermal loads and arbitrary
end conditions. The signiﬁcance of the end eﬀects can be
evaluated through a characteristic decay length. When
the temperature is prescribed on the lateral surfaces,
the end eﬀects are conﬁned to a local region near the
ends and the 2D solution can be used to evaluate the
thermal ﬁeld in the region of a characteristic decay
length from the ends. For other cases the end eﬀects
are far-reaching and the problem must be treated as 3D.

under the F–T and the T–F BC. This can be understood
by considering a segment of a thin-walled tube. When
the inner radius of the tube is large, the segment may
be regarded as a thin plate. Under the homogeneous
T–T BC, there should be no heat ﬂux in the middle plane
of the plate because of symmetry. Thus, a plate of thick-
ness 2h under the homogeneous T–T BC may be viewed
as a plate of thickness h under the homogeneous F–T BC
or under the homogeneous T–F BC. When the thick-
nesses of the plate in three cases are the same, the decay
length of the plate under the homogeneous T–T BC
must be a half of those of the other two.
6. Conclusions
We have studied the end eﬀects of heat conduction in
a hollow or solid circular cylinder of FGM and lami-ratio of a/b. It could be as long as 15b for a homogene-
ous cylinder and tends to inﬁnity for l = 5. In these cases
a 3D analysis of the problem is necessary. The dashed
lines in Figs. 1 and 2 are the lines according to the sim-
pliﬁed formula for the thin-walled tube. Notably, theNew York, 1965.Council of Taiwan, ROC through grant NSC 92-2211-

It brings in naturally the methods of matrix algebra
to obtain the solution for a specific problem. The
formalism is simple in concept and systematic in
operation.
In this paper we treat the generalized plane problems
of radially inhomogeneous, cylindrically anisotropic,
piezoelectric circular cylinders under the combined
action of extension, torsion, bending, surface tractions,
and temperature change. A similar problem of homo-
geneous piezoelectric materials has been considered
earlier by treating the individual equations (Tarn,
2002a). Consideration of radial inhomogeneity, includ-
ing the homogeneous material as a special case, is more
complicated in that one will encounter differential
equations with variable coefficients, to which a closed-
form solution is hard to be found in general. Herein,
we use the matrix notations to express the 3D equations
into a state equation and an output equation involving
only the first derivatives of the state vector. The state-
space formalism enables us to obtain an exact solution
for the problem in case the material properties vary
in the radial direction according to a power-law. The
solution serves as a benchmark for the problem.
For arbitrary radial inhomogeneity, two viable solution
schemes, namely, the piecewise-constant approximation
and power series approximation, are suggested to
determine an approximate solution for the problem.
MATRIX EQUATIONS OF
PIEZOTHERMOELASTICITY
We consider the piezoelectric material of general
anisotropy. Referring to the circular cylindrical coordi-
nates (r, , z), the linear piezothermoelastic constitutive
equations written out in full are
where ij and "ij are the stress and strain tensors, Di and
Ei are the electric displacement and electric field vectors,
T is the temperature field, cij the 21 elastic constants
measured at a constant electric field and constant
temperature, ij the permittivity constants measured at
constant strain and constant temperature, eij the piezo-
electric constants measured at constant temperature, i
the thermal coefficients measured at constant electric
field, p"i the pyroelectric constants measured at constant
strain. For a radially inhomogeneous material the
piezothermoelastic constants depend on r.
Equation (1) applies to all the 32 crystal classes of
the piezoelectric materials (Nye, 1985) and piezoelectric
ceramics. There are 54 independent piezothermoelastic
constants in total. In addition to the constitutive
equations, the basic field equations include the equa-
tions of equilibrium, the strain–displacement relations,
the relations between the electric field and the electric
potential, the equations of electrostatics, and the
boundary conditions (BC) for the problem under
consideration. All the equations are expressed in the
cylindrical coordinates. Obviously, the formulation
would be very cumbersome if one should deal with the
field equations and unknown variables individually.
On the basis of the state-space formalism (Tarn,
2002b,c,d), we can use the matrix notations to express
the 3D equations of piezothermoelasticity in the matrix
form as follows:

strain. When subjected to a torque at the ends and free
from surface tractions and body forces, it is in a state of
generalized torsion. Generalized plane strain in a
cylindrical body is also caused by bending moments
applied at the ends. These problems are referred to as
the generalized plane problem (Lekhnitskii, 1981). They
differ only in the BC and end conditions, thus can be
treated in the same context.
For the generalized plane problem, the stress and
strain are independent of z, but the displacement
depends on z: It can be shown (Lekhnitskii, 1981;
Tarn, 2002c) that the general expressions of the
displacement field are

where the rigid body displacements have been excluded;
u, v,w are unknown functions of r and ; the parameter "
represents a uniform extension; # is the twisting angle
per unit length along z-axis; A and B are associated with
bending. These parameters are as yet unknown.
Consider a piezoelectric cylinder subjected to electro-
thermomechanical loadings that do not vary in the axial
direction. The state equation and the output equation in
terms of the unknown displacement functions become

Equations (10) and (11) are neatly arranged in
which extension, torsion, bending, temperature change,
and body forces are included as the nonhomogeneous
terms. The effects of internal and external pressures
and shearing are accounted for through the lateral
BC. If one should follow the conventional approach,
the formulation would be too complicated to manage.

The constants of linear combination cn can be
determined by using the BC on r ¼ a and r ¼ b spec-
ified by Equations (12) and (13). Since these conditions
have been expressed in terms of rsr, the unknown
constants are readily found by expressing the prescribed
surface tractions in Fourier complex series and compar-
ing the corresponding terms in the equation. Note that
there is a remote possibility that the assumed form
of the particular solution may coincide with a term of
the homogeneous solution. Under this circumstance,
the assumed form must be modified by multiplying the
associated terms by log 
: The modification can be easily
done and is not given here.

Naturally, the accuracy of the piecewise-constant
approximation depends on the number of the fictitious
layers taken in approximating the continuous variation
of the radial inhomogeneity. As the scheme involves
only simple operations of 8 8 matrices, regardless of
the number of the fictitious layers, the computation
can be easily carried out by using Mathematica or
MATLAB. Whether the number is large or small is not

where Ai are constant matrices known from the
dependence of the material property on r.

This is precisely the particular solution given by
Equation (67). Thus we have shown that the power

for a homogeneous cylinder.
The power series approximation is a simple way to
obtain an approximate solution for the nonuniform
state equation. In essence, the scheme extends the
Frobenius method for solving an ordinary differential
equation with variable coefficients to a matrix differ-
ential equation with a nonuniform system matrix. While
the scheme is useful for treating the problem in which
the radial inhomogeneity is described by polynomials,
it is not suitable for a system with piecewise-continuous
radial inhomogeneity, such as laminated composites,
due to the convergence problem.
CLOSING REMARKS
From the solution for power-law radial inhomogene-
ity, it appears that the power of 
 may become negative
for certain values of 1 and 2 so that singularity arises
in a solid cylinder at r ¼ 0. This is not true because the
solution of a solid cylinder cannot be obtained from that
of a hollow cylinder by letting the inner radius a go to
zero – this results in a cylinder with a pin hole, not a
solid cylinder. In a recent paper (Tarn, 2002e) we have
examined the issue of stress singularity in an elastic
cylinder of cylindrically anisotropic materials. The
abnormal situations of stress singularity in a piezo-
electric cylinder with radial inhomogeneity can be dealt
with following the same line.
Strictly speaking, the states of generalized plane strain
and generalized torsion exist only in an infinitely long
prismatic cylinder subjected to loadings that do not vary
axially. For a generalized plane problem the exact
conditions at the ends are usually replaced by statically
equivalent conditions of the stress resultants and
satisfied in an average sense. Stress disturbance due to
the end effects occurs as a consequence. Study of the
stress decay in anisotropic laminates in the state-space
setting has been reported (Wang et al., 2000; Tarn and
Huang, 2002). It is known that the Saint-Venant end
effects in anisotropic elastic materials may not be local
to the boundary region. In order to evaluate the end
effects, a 3D analysis should be conducted. The state-
space formalism makes the analysis less formidable and
may prove to be effective.

ABSTRACT 
The effective length of a piezoelectric cylindrical specimen in strain measurements is determined by 
considering the stress decay in a cylindrically anisotropic, circular cylinders of piezoelectric materials 
subjected to 2D surface tractions and prescribed end loads. On the basis of the state space formalism, the 
problem is studied by means of matrix algebra. The significance of the end effects is evaluated through a 
characteristic decay length. The study enables us to assess Saint-Venant’s principle as applied to 
piezoelectricity in general and to determine the effective lengths of tensile and torsional specimens of 
piezoelectric materials in particular.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
When an elastic cylindrical body of a uniform 
cross-section is subjected to surface loads that do not 
vary in the axial direction, the problem may be 
formulated as a generalized plane strain problem [1] 
provided that the prescribed boundary conditions (BC) 
on the end surfaces are relaxed by replacing them by the 
statically equivalent ones in terms of the stress 
resultants over the cross section.  For the generalized 
plane strain solution to be exact the traction on the end 
surfaces must be specified in the same way as that in 
every other cross section, otherwise the stress field will 
be disturbed.  By virtue of Saint-Venant’s principle  
[2, 3], it is generally expected that the end effect causes 
only local disturbance and the stress decays to 2D 
rapidly.  Thus, the effective length of a tensile or 
torsional specimen of an isotropic elastic material is 
usually considered to be a short distance from the ends.  
In determining the effective lengths of piezoelectric 
cylindrical specimens in which there exist 
electromechanical coupling as well as material 
anisotropy, questions arise as to whether or not Saint- 
Venant’s principle is applicable [4].  How significant is 
the end effect? Is the disturbance confined to a local 
region? Under what circumstances is the generalized 
plane strain solution useful for a finite cylinder with the 
end conditions prescribed differently from those 
required by the 2D theory?  
In this paper we address these questions through 
analysis of a cylindrically anisotropic, piezoelectric 
circular cylinder subjected to 2D surface tractions and 
prescribed end loads.  A similar problem of heat 
conduction has been studied recently [5,6].  The 
problem is formulated on the basis of the state space 
formalism [7~13] by decomposing it into two 
fundamental problems: the first one is a 2D problem of 
an infinitely long cylinder subjected to the 2D surface 
tractions; the second one is a 3D problem of a finite 
cylinder subjected to zero surface tractions and arbitrary 
end loads.  As the first fundamental problem is a 
generalized plane strain problem and the stress is 
independent of the axial coordinate, in evaluating the 
stress decay it suffices to consider the second 
fundamental problem.  The significance of the end 
effects can be evaluated through a characteristic decay 
length determined from an eigensolution of the second 
fundamental problem.  
The study enables us to assess Saint-Venant’s 
principle as applied to piezoelectricity in general and to 
determine the effective length of tensile and torsional 
specimens of piezoelectric materials in particular.  By 
setting the piezoelectric constants equal to zero, the 
analysis is applicable to elastic cylinders as well.  It is 
found that the effective length of a tensile or torsional 
specimen depends largely on the material anisotropy 
and to a less degree on the electric BC.  When material 
anisotropy is weak and the outer surface is electric-

where pi0 and pil are the components of the prescribed 
tractions and electric displacements, they may be

radii of a hollow cylinder.  For a solid cylinder the BC

stress be bounded at r = 0.

where Un(r), Sn(r), i ( )n rU , and  ( )n rS  are unknown 
functions of r; αn, and βn are dimensionless parameters 
to be determined.  The terms associated with n = 0 are 
independent of θ, giving the solution for axisymmetric 
deformations under extension and torsion.  For 
positive real part of αn the influence of the first series 
decreases as z increases, whereas the influence of the 
second series increases.  As such, the decay from z = 0 
is dictated by the smallest positive value of the real part 
of αn and the decay from z = l by the smallest positive 
value of the real part of βn.  For a semi-infinite 
cylinder, l → ∞, the second series disappears.  As 
shown in the following, the decay rates (αn, βn) from 
both ends of a finite cylinder are the same.

Equations (11)1 and (11)2 are exactly the same if βn = 
−αn, showing that the decay rates from both ends are the 
same.  Moreover, it tells us that if αn is a decay rate, so 
is −αn.  Consequently, we may treat either Eq. (11)1 or

where c = 0 for a solid cylinder.  This orthogonality 
relation holds for a multilayered cylinder as well as a 
radially inhomogeneous functionally graded cylinder.  
Setting t = s in Eq. (28), we have  
 220 0s sα = .α  (30) 
This tells us that the eigenvalues α0s are either real or 
purely imaginary — they cannot be complex.  Since a 
purely imaginary α0s results in a trivial solution to Eq. 
(4), α0s must be real.  Thus, we have shown that the 
stress in the cylinder decays exponentially from the 
ends.  
5.  CHARACTERISTIC DECAY LENGTH 
A simple measure of the end effect is the 
characteristic decay length which defines the distance 
from the ends, beyond which the stress field is 
essentially 2D and no longer affected by the exact 
distribution of the prescribed loads on the end surfaces.  
According to Eq. (10), we may define the characteristic 
decay length as  
 ln100
ns
L b= ,α  (31) 
which is the distance measured from the end beyond 
which the displacements and stresses reduce to 1% of 
their values on the end.  Of course, other reduction 
percentages may be taken.  The smallest eigenvalue 
should be used to determine the largest L.  
In order to evaluate the significance of the effects of 
material anisotropy and electromechanical coupling, it 
is constructive to compare the results for a piezoelectric 
material with those obtained for a purely elastic material 
by setting eij = κij = 0.  This is helpful in identifying 
the nature of the mode to which the decay rate 
corresponds — whether it is a mechanical mode, an 
electric mode, or a coupling mode.  
The transcendental Eq. (20) can be solved easily by 
using MATLAB.  Accuracy based on the piecewise- 
constant approximation depends on the number of the 
fictitious layers taken to represent the non-uniform 
system matrix in Eq. (11).  Results presented herein 
were obtained by taking 20 fictitious layers.  The 
scheme is effective; even modeling a thick-walled 
cylinder by as many as 100 layers, it took only seconds 
to complete the computation in a PC. 
To check the validity of the computation, it is useful 
to consider a thin-walled elastic tube under extension 
and torsion.  By letting c = a/b→ 1, n = 0 and 
considering the orthotropic elastic material, we arrive at 
a simple formula

 (32) 
which may serve as a benchmark for estimating the 
eigenvalues of a thin-walled elastic tube.  
6.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
First, we consider the orthotropic elastic cylinders.  
The elastic moduli used in the computation are EL/ET = 
10, GLT/ET = 0.6, GTT/ET = 0.5, vLT = vTT = 0.25.  Figure 
1 shows the characteristic decay length versus the wall 
thickness of the elastic orthotropic cylinder under 
extension and torsion.  The decay length increases as 
the wall thickness of the hollow cylinder increases.  
The dashed line in the figure is the results according to 
Eq. (32) for the thin-walled tube.  The results agree 
well with those of the hollow cylinder with a wall 
thickness (b − a) / b ≤ 0.4.  Figure 2 depicts the 
characteristic decay length versus the ratio of the 
longitudinal Young’s modulus EL and the transverse 
Young’s modulus ET of a solid cylinder and a hollow 
cylinder (a/b = 0.5).  The characteristic decay length 
increases significantly as EL/ET increases.  The 
characteristic decay length of the solid cylinder 
increases more rapidly than that of the hollow cylinder.  
It could reach as high as 10b for EL/ET = 40 and 14b for 
EL/ET = 80 This indicates that the material anisotropy 
has a significant effect on the stress decay in a solid 
cylinder.  The end effects cannot be ignored in 
evaluating the effective lengths of tensile and torsional 
specimens of anisotropic materials.  
Next, we consider piezoelectric cylinders of PZT-4 
and TeO2.  The material properties are listed in Table 1.  
Note that TeO2 (EL/ET ≈ 2) has more pronounced 
anisotropy than PZT-4 (EL/ET ≈ 1).  The first few 
eigenvalues of the solid cylinder under various electric 
BC are given in Table 2 in which the decay rate 
associated with the mechanical mode is denoted by M, 
the one associated with the coupling mode by C.  Due 
to the stronger anisotropy of TeO2, the end effect of the 
solid cylinder under the electric-insulated BC is 
controlled by mechanical mode.  The stress 
disturbance is localized to a small region (L ≈ 2b) from 
the end.  This is consistent with the results in Fig. 2.

prescribed differently from those required by the 2D 
theory, the difference in the electric BC on the inner and 
outer surfaces makes the electric effect extend farther 
away from the region near the end where the electric 
field is inherently 3D.  By contrast, when the same 
type of the electric BC are prescribed on the inner and 
outer surfaces, as the electric field reaches equilibrium 
over the cross section more rapidly, stress decay is 
governed primarily by the mechanical properties so that 
the material anisotropy plays a major role.  Note that 
in Figs. 3 and 4 there are jumps at a = 0.01 (a cylinder 
with a pin-hole) and a = 0 (a solid cylinder) due to the 
stress concentration in the cylinder with a pin-hole [18].  
The solid cylinder cannot be regarded as a hollow 
cylinder by letting the inner radius tend to zero.  
7.  CONCLUSIONS 
The end effects and stress decay in a cylindrically 
anisotropic piezoelectric circular cylinder subjected 2D 
surface tractions and prescribed end loads have been 
studied.  The end effect can be evaluated through the 
characteristic decay length determined from the 
eigensolution of a fundamental problem of a finite 
cylinder.  For a hollow cylinder under tension or 
torsion, the characteristic decay length depends on the 
material anisotropy, the ratio of the inner and outer radii, 
and the electric BC on the inner surface of the cylinder.  
When the material anisotropy is weak and the outer 
surface is electric-grounded, the end effect is localized 
to a decay length L ≈ 2b from the ends beyond which the 
electromechanical field is essentially 2D.  For the 
thick-walled tubes with a grounded inner surface and an 
insulated outer surface, the end effect is far-reaching 
and the electromechanical field is affected by the end 
conditions over the entire length of the cylinder.  For a 
solid cylindrical specimen the characteristic decay 
length depends largely on the material anisotropy and to 
a less extent on the electric BC.  In general, Saint- 
Venant’s principle is not applicable to piezoelectric 
cylinders of strong material anisotropy and 
electromechanical coupling.

Don the end eﬀects. To examine the conjecture of Saint-Venant’s torsion, we consider torsion of circular bars with one endﬁxed and the other end free on which tractions that results in a pure torque are prescribed arbitrarily over the free end
surface. Exact solutions that satisfy the prescribed boundary conditions point by point over the entire boundary surfaces
are derived in a uniﬁed manner for cylindrically orthotropic bars with or without radial inhomogeneity and for their coun-
terparts of Saint-Venant’s torsion. Stress diﬀusion due to the end eﬀect is examined in the light of the exact solutions.

which suggests that the end eﬀect is far-reaching for strong anisotropy (c44 c66). Since c44 = c66 for isotropic
materials, L = 0.8967b, suggesting that the stress disturbance is indeed conﬁned to a local region near the end
in a long homogeneous isotropic bar. Tables 1 and 2 show the smallest eigenvalue k1 associated with theDsuﬃciently long bar it can be deduced from Eqs. (48)–(50) and (77)–(79) that the stress diﬀusion from the

5. Results and discussion
It has been shown that the leading terms in the exact solution are identical to the Saint-Venant solution and
the end eﬀects are described solely by the series terms of Eqs. (56)–(58). Obviously, the BC at both ends of a
ﬁnite circular bar play important roles in the stress distribution and they are indistinguishable in general. Yet,Oribed in a particular manner as assumed above. In practice, one can hardly apply p(r) in the same mannermanded. Consequently, stress disturbance due to the end eﬀect occurs. In the next section we shall eval-the end eﬀect quantitatively by comparing Eq. (34) for Saint-Venant’s torsion against the exact solutionO

so that the series terms in Eqs. (85)–(87) vanish and the solutions are precisely the same as their Saint-Venant
counterparts given by Eq. (34).
The results show that the Saint-Venant solution is exact provided that the traction over the end surface isse cite this article in press as: Tarn, J.-Q., Chang, H.-H., Torsion of cylindrically orthotropic elastic circular bars ...,
