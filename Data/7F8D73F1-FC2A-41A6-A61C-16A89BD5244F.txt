focused on CuGaS2 layers for the applications of Solar 
Cells. In this first part, the sub-micron ink was 
prepared using wet-type ball milling, and then the ink 
was printed onto a Si substrate to form a precursor 
layer by spin coating. The precursor layer was then 
sintered to form the chalcopyrite structure. Sintering 
of the precursor layers was carried out in a RTA. The 
sintering time was 10 minutes and temperatures from 
400℃ to 750°C. The ink consisted of two binary 
compound powers, CuS and In2Se3. By adjusting the 
ratio of CuS and In2Se3 powders, we obtained a 
slightly Cu-poor CuIn(SeS)2 thin film by rapid thermal 
process without toxic Se or H2Se atmosphere. The 
experimental results show the CuIn(SeS)2 precursor 
layer, were transformed into chalcopyrite structure by 
RTA, as the temperature increased to 600°C, the four 
reflections (101), (112), (200), and (312) of the 
CuIn(SeS)2 structure became apparent. In the second 
part, the ink consists of two compound powders, CuS 
and Ga2S3. The Cu/Ga is adjusted by the ratio CuS to 
Ga2S3. The precursor layer is placed in RTA furnace, 
and then heated 10 minutes at the temperature between 
400℃ and 800℃. The XRD analysis result shows that 
these post-RTA samples have chalcopyrite structure. 
The optical absorption coefficients of Cu-rich is 
higher than Cu-poor because the CuS content increases. 
It is known that the CuS has stronger near-infrared 
absorption. The energy band gap is measured by UV-vis 
absorption and photoluminescence excitation. The 
result shows that Cu-poor band gap is about 1.8 eV and 
Cu-rich band gap is about 1.9 eV. We have developed a 
non-vacuum process for fabricating CuGaS2 thin film 
without H2Se gas or Se vapor. Based on the results of 
this experiment, the best Cu-poor CuGaS2 thin film 
(thickness 1.5 ~ 2 μm) with chalcopyrite structure 
could be obtained by heating at 650°C.

ABSTRACT 
The forming of I-Ⅲ-Ⅵ2 absorber layers for photovoltaic devices have two types of processes, a vacuum process and a 
non-vacuum process. The vacuum process is that absorber layers are deposited by Co-evaporation or sputtering of metallic 
precursor followed by selenization in a furnace using H2Se gas. The non-vacuum process, on the other hand, is a method of 
forming absorber layer by printed or electro-deposition. The non-vacuum process has most potential for low cost.  Although I-Ⅲ
-Ⅵ2 thin film solar cells with power conversion efficiencies approaching 20 % have been demonstrated, the major methods of 
absorber layers are vacuum processes. However, low cost processing for photovoltaic device fabrication is a tendency. In this 
work, we present a study on CuIn(SeS)2 thin film of absorber layers for photovoltaic devices prepared by non-vacuum process. 
The sub-micron ink was prepared using wet-type ball milling, and then the ink was printed onto a silicon substrate to form a 
precursor layer by spin coating. The precursor layer was then sintered to form the chalcopyrite structure. Sintering of the precursor 
layers was carried out in a RTA that employed a 10 % H2 and 90 % Ar gas mixture. The sintering time was 10 minutes and the 
sintering temperature range from 400℃ to 750°C. The ink consisted of two binary compound powers, CuS and In2Se3. By 
adjusting the ratio of CuS and In2Se3 powders, we obtained a slightly Cu-poor CuIn(SeS)2 thin film by rapid thermal process 
without toxic Se or H2Se atmosphere. Elemental composition was characterized by using EDS, surface morphology and 
cross-section of freshly cleaved CuIn(SeS)2 sample were observed by SEM, and crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD). The experimental results show the CuIn(SeS)2 precursor layer, with thickness1-2 µm, were transformed into 
chalcopyrite structure by RTA, as the temperature increased to 600°C, the four reflections (101), (112), (200), and (312) of the 
CuIn(SeS)2 structure became apparent. As the temperature increased to 750°C, it was observed that the (112) peaks shift to larger 
2θ, it may be caused by the partial substitution of Se with S in the CuIn(SeS)2 films. Using higher temperature (700 and 750°C) 
for the heat treatment, a significant larger grain structure (0.7µm) were observed. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Considering the limited of current energy resources and 
their environment impact, there is no doubt that the 
development of renewable energy sources such as 
photovoltaic solar cells is becoming more important. The 
I-III-VI2 compounds copper indium diselenide, CuInSe2, and 
its alloys with gallium and sulfur such as Cu(InGa)Se2 and 
Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 are currently one of the leading candidate 
materials for choices large-scale photovoltaic power plants. 
The reasons for this are threefold. First, polycrystalline thin 
film solar cells could be fabricated in sufficiently large 
volumes and at sufficiently low costs to competitive with 
conventional power sources. Second, CulnSe2 [Cu(lnGa)Se2] 
heterojunction solar cells have been demonstrated to achieve 
~20% efficiency[1], reaching the level of bulk polycrystalline 
Si solar cells. Third, no evidence for long or short-term device 
degradation is observed in these cells. However, The 
conventional vacuum-based methods, such as 4 or 5 sources 
co-evaporation, and metal sputtering followed H2Se 
selenization, are difficulty to reduce the cost, due to process 
complexity and difficulty in scaling up. Recently, a 
non-vacuum[2-5], nano-particle-based method, which is applied 
to the fabrication of a Cu(InGa)Se2 absorber layer, has 
received much attention. The selenide nano-particles, such as 
CuSe, InSe and GaSe, are applied so that the expensive H2Se 
reduction processing is not necessary, compared with the 
method using oxided particles. The non-vacuum method 
provides a possibility to overcome the disadvantage of 
vacuum-based methods, and to fabricate large-scale 
Cu(InGa)Se2 solar cells with low cost owing to the simple and 
high throughput process.  
In the study, non-vacuum CuIn(SeS)2 processes are 
examined. the nanoparticle ink is prepared using wet-type ball 
milling, and then the ink is printed on a substrate to form a 
precursor layer by spin coating. The ink consists of two 
compound powders, CuS and In2Se3. The Cu/Ga is adjusted 
by the ratio CuS to In2Se3. Then the precursor layer is heated 
by RTA, with 90% Ar / 10% H2 working gas, to form the 
compound layer with chalcopyrite structure. XRD, SEM and 
EDX are used to examine the properties of the CuGaS2 films. 
We have developed a non-vacuum process for fabricating 
CuIn(SeS)2 thin film without H2Se gas or Se vapor. Based on 
the results of this experiment, the Cu-poor CuIn(SeS)2 thin 
film (average grain size less thsn 0.5µm) with chalcopyrite 
structure could be obtained by heating at 600°C. When the 
temperature reaches 700°C, a larger grain structure (average 
grain size 0.7µm) is observed.   
 
Experimental 
 
The experimental procedure is shown in Fig. 1. The 
substrates used in this experiment are silicon wafer (1×1cm2). 
The ink of CuS/In2Se3 selenide compound submicron-sized 
(or nanometer-sized) particles are prepared by using 
high-energy ball milling (wet-type) and then spin-coated onto 
the substrates. The ink consists of two compound powders, 
CuS and In2Se3. The Cu/In is adjusted by the ratio CuS to 
In2Se3. The precursor layer is placed in RTA furnace, 90% Ar 
/ 10% H2 working gas, and then heated 10 minutes at the

3.3 XRD analysis of the CuIn(SeS)2 films 
Fig. 5 is XRD results of CuS, In2Se3 original powders and 
as-printed Cu-poor films. The CuS and In2Se3 original 
powders show single phase compounds. The In the XRD 
spectra of as-printed Cu-poor film, only CuS (006) peak 
appear, implied that brittle In2Se3 particles are grinded into 
nano-size, while the CuS particles are nano-size and 
submicro-size. Fig. 6 is a series of XRD results of Cu-poor 
CuIn(SeS)2 films under different temperature heat treatment. 
In the XRD spectra of as-deposited Cu-poor film, CuS(006) 
peak domonate. In the XRD of 400°C Cu-poor film, 
chalcopyrite CuIn(SeS)2 (112) and (220) peaks are observed. 
In the XRD of 600°C Cu-poor film, chalcopyrite CuIn(SeS)2 
(112), (220), (204) and (312) peaks are observed. The 750°C 
Cu-poor film has same peaks as 600°C Cu-poor film, while 
the full width at half maximum of (112) peak is narrower. It 
implies that the grain size of the 750°C Cu-poor film is larger, 
consistent with the SEM results.

Conclusions 
 
We have developed a non-vacuum process for fabricating 
Cu-poor CuIn(SeS)2 thin film without H2Se gas or Se vapor. 
Based on the results of this experiment, the best Cu-poor 
CuIn(SeS)2 thin film (thickness ~ 2 μm) with chalcopyrite 
structure could be obtained by heating at 600°C. 
In the non-vacuum Cu-poor CuIn(SeS)2 processes, the 
nanoparticle ink is prepared using wet-type ball milling, and 
then the ink is printed to form a precursor layer by spin 
coating. The ink consists of two compound powders, CuS and 
In2Se3. The Cu/Ga is adjusted by the ratio CuS to In2Se3. The 
precursor layer is placed in RTA furnace, and then heated to 
form the compound layer with chalcopyrite structure. The 
SEM and XRD results show the CuIn(SeS)2 precursor layer, 
with thickness 1-2 µm, were transformed into chalcopyrite 
structure by RTA, as the temperature increased to 600°C, 
according as the chalcopyrite CuIn(SeS)2 (101), (112), (200), 
and (312) become apparent in the XRD. As the temperature 
increased to 750°C, it is observed that the (112) peaks shift to 
larger 2θ, it may be caused by the partial substitution of Se 
with S in the CuIn(SeS)2 films. When the temperature is high 
than 600°C, the grain grows. When the temperature is 700°C, 
the average grain size is ~0.7μm. At 750°C, the grain grows 
larger, the average grain size is ~1μm, however the film 
becomes loose and porous.

ABSTRACT 
CuGaS2 is one of the I-III-VI2 compounds for solar cell absorber layer materials. In the study of non-vacuum CuGaS2 processes, 
the nanoparticle ink is prepared using wet-type ball milling, and then the ink is printed on a substrate to form a precursor layer by 
spin coating. The ink consists of two compound powders, CuS and Ga2S3. The Cu/Ga is adjusted by the ratio CuS to Ga2S3. The 
precursor layer is placed in RTA furnace, 90% Ar / 10% H2 working gas, and then heated 10 minutes at the temperature between 
400℃ and 800℃ to form the compound layer with chalcopyrite structure. Non-vacuum processing is capable of reducing the cost 
of manufacturing significantly. According to the Cu/Ga atomic ratio, the prepared samples can be classified to two types: Cu-rich 
(Cu/Ga atomic ratio is equal to 1.02, after 650°C RTA) and Cu-poor (Cu/Ga atomic ratio is equal to 0.87, after 650°C RTA) 
samples. Microstructural studies are carried out using X-ray diffractometer. From the XRD results, CuGaS2 thin film with the full 
width at half maximum becoming narrow as the Cu content increases. The mean crystallite size also increases when Cu/Ga ratio is 
increased. This result is consistent with the SEM micrographs. Some displacement towards higher diffraction angles is detected 
when the Cu content increases. The result shows that the heat treatment temperature increases, some displacement towards lower 
diffraction angles is detected because of the decreases of the sulfur content. The XRD analysis result shows that these post-RTA 
samples have chalcopyrite structure. The optical absorption coefficients of Cu-rich is higher than Cu-poor because the CuS 
content increases. It is known that the CuS has stronger near-infrared absorption. The energy band gap is measured by UV-vis 
absorption and photoluminescence excitation. The result shows that Cu-poor band gap is about 1.8 eV and Cu-rich band gap is 
about 1.9 eV. We have developed a non-vacuum process for fabricating CuGaS2 thin film without H2Se gas or Se vapor. Based on 
the results of this experiment, the best Cu-poor CuGaS2 thin film (thickness 1.5 ~ 2 μm) with chalcopyrite structure could be 
obtained by heating at 650°C. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
As the impacts of environmental and energy resource 
have increased, greater stress has been placed on the 
development of renewable energy sources such as 
photovoltaic applications. The I-III-VI2 compounds copper 
indium diselenide[1], CuInSe2, and its alloys with gallium and 
sulfur such as Cu(InGa)Se2 and Cu(InGa)(SeS)2 are leading 
candidates for absorber materials in large-area photovoltaic 
power generation systems. Devices based on Cu(InGa)Se2 
have achieved high active area efficiencies over 20 % by 
co-evaporation method[2]. However, The conventional 
vacuum-based methods, such as co-evaporation, and 
sputtering, are difficulty to reduce the cost, due to the 
drawbacks such as process complexity and difficulty in 
scaling up. Recently, a non-vacuum, nano-particle-based 
method, which is applied to the fabrication of a Cu(InGa)Se2 
absorber layer, has received much attention[3]. The selenide 
nano-particles, such as CuSe, InSe and GaSe, are applied so 
that the expensive H2Se reduction processing is not necessary, 
compared with the method using oxided particles. The 
non-vacuum method provides a possibility to overcome the 
disadvantage of vacuum-based methods, and to fabricate 
large-scale solar Cu(InGa)Se2 cells with low cost owing to the 
simple and high throughput process. 
In the study, non-vacuum CuGaS2 processes are examined. 
the nanoparticle ink is prepared using wet-type ball milling, 
and then the ink is printed on a substrate to form a precursor 
layer by spin coating. The ink consists of two compound 
powders, CuS and Ga2S3. The Cu/Ga is adjusted by the ratio 
CuS to Ga2S3. Then the precursor layer is heated by RTA, 
with 90% Ar / 10% H2 working gas, to form the compound 
layer with chalcopyrite structure. XRD, SEM, EDX, UV-vis 
absorption and PL measurement are used to examine the 
properties of the CuGaS2 films. We have developed a 
non-vacuum process for fabricating CuGaS2 thin film without 
H2Se gas or Se vapor. Based on the results of this experiment, 
the best Cu-poor CuGaS2 thin film (thickness 1.5 ~ 2 μm) 
with chalcopyrite structure could be obtained by heating at 
650°C. 
 
Experimental 
 
The experimental procedure is shown in Fig. 1. The 
substrates used in this experiment are sodalime glass 
substrates and silicon wafer (1×1cm2). The ink of CuSe/GaSe 
selenide compound submicron-sized (or nanometer-sized) 
particles are prepared by using high-energy ball milling 
(wet-type) and then spin-coated onto the substrates. The ink 
consists of two compound powders, CuS and Ga2S3. The 
Cu/Ga is adjusted by the ratio CuS to Ga2S3. The precursor 
layer is placed in RTA furnace, 90% Ar / 10% H2 working gas, 
and then heated 10 minutes at the temperature between 400°C 
and 800°C First, a rotary mechanical pump is used to create a 
vacuum about 3×10-2 Torr, and then a diffusion pump is used 
to create a vacuum under 5×10-5 Torr to reduce the residue of 
oxygen elements, and 90% Ar / 10% H2 is added to 3-5 Torr. 
Then, the temperature is increased in a speed 3°C/sec[4] to 
400°C - 800°C.The compositions of the films are determined 
by EDS. A standard CuGaS2 specimen is used for the 
particles, similar to that of the Cu-poor, however the average 
particle size is larger . When the temperature is high than 
600°C, the grain grows. The temperature is 650°C, the 
average grain size is ~ 1μm. When the temperature is 800°C, 
the film becomes loose and pores.

average grain size is ~0.5μm. When the temperature is 800°C, 
the grain grows larger. The film becomes loose and thinner 
due to volatility of Se and InSe rapidly.

Cu-poor film has same peaks as 600°C Cu-poor film, while

the grain size of the 650°C Cu-poor film is larger, consistent 
with the SEM results.

摘要
本文是研究太陽能電池光吸收材料銅鎵二硫(CuGaS2)薄膜之非真空(Non-
vacuum)製程，其製程是利用球磨法(Ball Milling)來製作銅鎵二硫前驅物漿料
(Ink)，再以旋轉塗佈法(Spin Coating)將其漿料塗佈於基板上形成CuGaS2前驅層
(Precursor)薄膜，所用的前驅物是由CuS和Ga2S3等兩種化合物混合所形成，且可
獨立調整兩種前驅物成分比例，以獲得不同的Cu/Ga比，再置於RTP爐管內進行
(400~800℃)快速退火處理，藉由高溫擴散，製備出具黃銅礦(Chalcopyrite)結構特
性之CuGaS2薄膜，使用非真空製程製備吸收層可大幅降低成本。而CGS2薄膜會
隨著Cu含量的增加，半高寬變窄，晶粒尺寸會隨之變大；XRD之特徵峰會隨Cu
含量增加向高角度(2θ)偏移。依Cu/Ga原子比將薄膜分為Cu-rich與Cu-poor兩種類
型，利用X光繞射進行分析，結果顯示CuGaS2薄膜具有黃銅礦結構之結晶特性。
本研究發展新方式製備CuGaS2前驅層，其特點是熱處理時間不需太長，且不需
通入硒(Se)蒸氣或硒化氫(H2Se)等氣體，由實驗分析之結果，熱處理溫度650℃、
持溫10分鐘可得到的黃銅礦(Chalcopyrite)結構之CuGaS2薄膜為最佳。

相比顯得稍少一點而Cu含量提升，表中
顯示之成份比例判斷可能出現CuS相，
為高溫下S元素揮發留下較多的孔洞所
造成；Cu-rich之EDS成份分析(如表2)整
體之差異性比較小，但也隨著溫度的升
高，S含量會減少，Cu含量會增加 [2]。
利用EDS的原子比來判別Cu-poor及Cu-
rich，結果Cu-poor之Cu/Ga原子比為0.87 
(表1之650℃熱處理)，而Cu-poor的原始
設計是設定劑量比(原子比Cu/Ga=1)與
EDS成份分析計算之Cu/Ga原子比數值
有落差，推測是因為CuS較不易研磨，

(三)CuGaS2顯微結構分析
圖5及圖6分別為Cu-poor及Cu-rich
之CuGaS2薄膜施以400℃~800℃的快速
退火處理，在不同退火溫度的SEM截面
顯微結構。可以看出Cu-poor的初鍍膜
(如圖5(a))之結構為形狀不一且獨立的
晶粒，在做熱處理溫度400℃時，薄膜
中殘留的有機溶劑揮發，CuGaS2晶粒
開始成長且整體薄膜都有反應，跟初鍍
膜相比薄膜較為連續(如圖5(b))，而熱
處理溫度為500℃，表面形貌與熱處理
400℃差異不大(如圖5(c))，直到熱處理
溫度600℃時，表面形態開始有細小的
晶粒析出(如圖5(d))，當熱處理溫度繼續
加熱到650℃的時候，細小晶粒逐漸成
長到約0.5µm(如圖5(e))，當熱處理溫度
繼續加熱至700℃，隨溫度上升同時也
伴隨著S的揮發導致薄膜厚度變薄(如圖
5(f))，熱處理溫度直到750℃甚至800℃
厚度只剩1µm(如圖5(g)和(h))，薄膜之結
晶看起來明顯的不一樣，有可能是CuS
之晶粒。而Cu-rich之初鍍膜晶粒與Cu-
poor相比，也因CuS含量增加且稍具有
延展性，因此初鍍膜結構為多為平板狀
且有稀少的片狀晶粒(如圖6(a))，其熱處
理溫度400℃時，因有機溶劑揮發，可
以看出晶粒開始反應成長(如圖6(b))，
而熱處理溫度在500℃的時候，與初鍍
膜相比整體反應較為完全(如圖6(c))，
直到熱處理溫度650℃時，有明顯的大
晶粒出現約1µm(如圖6(d))，跟Cu-poor

650℃相比並無太大的差異，但黃銅礦
(Chalcopyrite)結構之強度持續增強，
晶粒還在成長，結晶性隨之增加。
圖8為Cu-rich之CuGaS2薄膜在不同
熱處理溫度下的XRD圖譜，與Cu-poor
之CuGaS2薄膜比較起來，在其初鍍膜的
XRD圖譜中發現，CuS的(103)、(006)及
(110)之特徵峰較明顯，是因為Cu的比例
增加，造成此結果；在熱處理溫度400℃
時，剩下部分CuS的特徵峰(103)、(006)
及(110)也如Cu-poor一樣逐漸消失，也形
成具有黃銅礦(Chalcopyrite)相之CuGaS2
薄膜，隨熱處理溫度增加，也逐漸形成
單一黃銅礦結構，但在其650℃之Cu-
rich的半高寬稍比Cu-poor的半高寬來的
窄，由此可以得知，Cu-rich所製備的
CuGaS2薄膜晶粒比Cu-poor來的大且結晶
性較好[3]，如圖6(e)SEM分析結果相符，
溫度持續升高，黃銅礦(Chalcopyrite)結
構之強度也持續增大，晶粒依然在成
長，結晶性隨之提升，但是在溫度800℃
有有CuS相的特徵峰出現，由此可知，
不論Cu-poor和Cu-rich，其熱處理溫度
650℃、持溫10分鐘時，CuGaS2薄膜具
備黃銅礦(Chalcopyrite)結構且薄膜整體
品質較完整。

本研究計畫成果含兩部份，第一部份是研究銅銦硫硒[CuIn(SeS)2]薄膜，第二部份是研究
銅鎵二硫（CuGaS2）在太陽能電池吸收層材料之應用。I-III-VI 族化合物薄膜是最具有潛
力之光伏太陽電池材料之一，本研究計劃研究以二元硒化物製成銅銦鎵硒 I-III-VI 化合
物薄膜，以 XRD 和 SEM 探討其結晶性，並研究其在量產光伏太陽電池應用之可行性，並探
討最佳製程條件。研究之動機為以本研究室最近幾年對於銅銦鎵硒(CIGS) [Cu(InGa)Se2]
之晶體表面能之研究、結晶構造之研究、晶體成長之研究及就最近研究塗佈法 I-III-VI
族銅鎵二硒(CGS)[CuGaSe2]之成果為基礎，作更進一步探討非真空塗佈印刷法生產銅銦鎵
硒(CIGS)多晶薄膜技術，期望在非真空塗佈印刷法 CIGS 薄膜之製程及其在太陽能電池產
業之應用能有更深入之了解。部份研究計畫成果有如下三篇已發表論文：
