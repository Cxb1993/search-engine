single-pass UILSI comb ﬁlters with FSR of 0.4 nm had successfully
obtained the simultaneously lasing multiwavelengths from 1563 nm
to 1612 nm, which could cover the full L-band with SNR of 20 dB.
However the modulation depths of the SNRs were too small, which
were similar to the direct responses of the comb ﬁlter measured by a
broadband source and an optical spectrum analyzer.
In the previous references, the SNRs larger than 20 dB obtained by
the MWFLs were usually accompanied by the lasing bandwidths
smaller than 25 nm [1–6,9–15]. There are very few reports that can
achieve the lasing bandwidths broader than 40 nm [7,8,16,17].
However, they are accompanied by the SNRs less than 20 dB. Based
on the hybrid mechanisms of the NPR-IDL and the single-pass UILSI
with the advantages of lasing-waveband broadening proposed in our
previous reports [16,17], in this paper, we propose a novel type of
comb ﬁlter by modifying the single-pass UILSI to be as a dual-pass
scheme in order to obtain double interferences for the effect of
spectral-waveform reshaping, which is proposed to help the MWFLs
enlarge the SNRs of the lasing wavelengths. The combinations of the
dual-pass UILSI and the NPR-IDL are with the purposes to obtain the
broader lasing bandwidths and the larger SNRs at the same time to
involve more useful lasing-wavelengths. The enhancements of the
proposed MWFL have been veriﬁed experimentally.
2. Experimental setup and principles
The both schemes of NPR-IDL and UILSI had been implemented in
the EDFA-based MWFLs to effectively suppress the mode competi-
tions of multiwavelength lasing in our previous report [17]. In this
study, the proposed novel comb ﬁlter by modifying the UILSI for the
effect of double interferences could be named as a dual-pass UILSI. The
comb ﬁlter is composed of one piece of ﬁber mirror, one piece of
polarization controller (PC2), two pieces of ﬁber polarizers, and one
segment of polarization maintaining ﬁber (PMF) with length of 12 m,
of which the conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 1.
The optics axes of the pigtailed PMFs of polarizer-1 and -2 are
respectively aligned with azimuth angle of respective to the optics axes
of the PMF segment at the both sides to be fused together. The other
pigtailed ﬁber of the polarizer-2 is single mode ﬁber (SMF) to be fused
with a mechanical polarization controller (PC2). The reﬂective terminal
of the combﬁlter is an SMF-pigtailedmirror to be fusedwith the PC2. As
lightwaveswith randomstates of polarization (SOP) propagate through
the polarizer-1, the light waves become linear SOP. Due to the optics-
axis alignment of between the polarizer and the PMF, the linear
polarized light waves could become two orthogonal modes with equal
intensities. Both modes of the light waves propagating respectively
along the fast and the slow axes of the PMF segment could accumulate
phase differences. As the light waves arrive at the polarizer-2, the
projections of the orthogonal modes onto the optics axis of the
polarizer-2 could cause the ﬁrst time of interferences, which generate
the wavelength-dependent comb-like interference fringes. As the
terminal mirror reﬂects the light waves back through the polarizer-2
and the PMF segment, the polarizer-1 could generate the second timeof
interferences to reshape the interference fringes additionally.
The responses of the UILSIs with the schemes of single-pass and
dual-pass respectively are measured by using a broadband source
(DenseLight SLED) and an OSA (Ando 8610) for the comparisons of
interference fringes. The measured results shown in Fig. 2 indicate
that the lasing wavelengths of the dual-pass scheme obtain the
modulation depth of 6-dB increase and the 3-dB linewidth of 0.02-nm
decrease compared with the single-pass scheme. The smaller FSR has
smaller modulation depth for the UILSI with one time of interference.
Due to the double interference of the dual-pass scheme, the result of
the modulation depth of 26 dB is better than the different kinds of
comb ﬁlters with the FSR of 0.4 nm used in the references [1,5,13–15]
and approximates to themodulation depth of the ﬁlter with the FSR of
0.4 nm used in the reference [18].
For the purpose of structure-simpliﬁed ﬁber laser, the PMF-pigtailed
mirror directly fused with the PMF-pigtailed polarizer-2 without the
need of PC2 also has been tested in comparisons with the original
structure in Fig. 1. Because a little imperfect optics-axis alignment could
affect the effective interferences signiﬁcantly, it is difﬁcult for the
modulation depths to reach the same results obtained by the SMF-
pigtailed mirror with the PC2. The PC2 is recommended to integrate
with the mirror for polarization ﬁne-tuning in order to obtain the
optimal modulation depths.
The FSR of Δλ for the comb-like spectra at an operation
wavelength region of λ can be estimated by the formula of Δλ=λ2/
(ΔnPMF· lPMF) based on a speciﬁed PMF length of lPMF with birefrin-
gence of ΔnPMF. In the case for the FSR set to 0.4 nm, the length of the
PMF segment required for the dual-pass UILSI is around 12 m. Because
the ﬁrst time of interferences of the dual-pass UILSI should
accumulate optical path difference from the polarizer-1 to polarizer-
2, the length of the PMF required is two times the needs for the single-
pass UISI in order to obtain the same FSR.
The resonant cavity of the MWFL includes two pieces of 980-nm
pump lasers, each operating from 50 to 350 mW. Two pieces ofWDMs
are used to connect the pump lasers with the resonant cavity. A
segment of EDF with a length of 8 m acts as a gain medium. A 3-port
circulator is used to connect the resonant cavity with the dual-pass
UILSI. A coupler with coupling ratio of 2.5% is connected to the
circulator for laser outputs. The structure of the NPR-IDL includes
2-km-SMF coils, a polarizer (polarizer-1), and a polarization controller
(PC1). The principle of the NPR [10,11,17] is that the higher power of

multiwavelengths and to broaden the lasing bandwidth for more
wavelengths to simultaneously oscillate in the resonant cavity.
3. Results and discussions
Fig. 3 is the measured spectrum of the proposed MWFL with the
pump lasers operating at the power of 700 mW. The results indicate
the coverage of the spectrum with a 6-dB-ﬂatness could be from
1563 nm to 1610 nm, in which the width of 47 nm involving 117
lasing wavelengths with the FSR of 0.4 nm could cover the full L-band.
However, the uneven values of SNRs from 22 dB to 34 dB are caused
by the excess ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (ASE) noises, which is
the rest issue required to be solved in the next experiments. The total
pump powers operating from 700 mW to 100 mW with the step of
100 mW to input the MWFL are for the investigations of the threshold
pump-power to generate multiwavelength lasing. The most even and
the largest SNRs of the mutiwavelenth lasing could be obtained at the
pump power as low as 100 mW.
Fig. 4 shows the diagrams for the lasing spectra measurements of
the MWFL operating with various pump powers. The ASE noises
signiﬁcantly become smaller as the pump powers decrease. The
threshold pump power could be found around 100 mW to effectively
activate the MWFL to radiate the multiwavelengths. The enlarged
diagram of Fig. 4 with pump power of 100 mW is shown in Fig. 5,
which indicates the even SNRs of 37 dB accompanied by the 3-dB
linewidth of 0.078 nm have been achieved for the coverage from
1560 nm to 1609 nm with the spectral ﬂatness of 6 dB.
According to themeasurements shown in Fig. 5, the statistical graphs
of the linewidths, the SNRs, the spectral ﬂatness, and the 6-dB lasing
bandwiths of the MWFLs operating with various pump powers have
been done and shown in Fig. 6. The slope of linewidth-tendency is ﬂat
and below 0.09 nm, which means the pump powers are not relative to
the enhancements of the linewidths. The tendency graph of the SNRs
indicates the lower pump power could obtain the larger and the more
even SNRs. Especially, as the pump laser operates with the power of
100 mW, the average SNR is around 40 dB. The improvements of the
spectral ﬂatness could be below 4 dB as the pump laser operates with
the power more than 200 mW. The 6-dB-lasing-bandwidths are all
more than 42 nm, which is sufﬁcient to cover the full L-band. The lasing
bandwidth increases 5 nm by the additional pump power more than
400 mW, which is not necessary in real applications. Hence, the
multiwavelengths generated by the pump power of 100 mW already
have enough bandwidth with the proper anchored waveband to cover
the full L-band. The excess pump powers could be for external optical
ampliﬁers to enlarge the powers of each lasing peaks effectively thanks
to the ﬂattened spectra and the large SNRs of multiwavelengths.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a dual-
pass UILSI as a novel comb ﬁlter for implements in erbium-doped ﬁber
lasers to obtain wide lasing wavebands of multiwavelength radiations
with enhancements of SNRs. The hybrid combinations of the combﬁlter
with the two schemes of NPR and IDL have successfully not only
enlarged the lasing bandwidth up to 47 nm but also enhanced the SNR
up to 40 dB. The simpliﬁed laser structure of the hybridmechanism is an
extra advantage. The simultaneous lasing-wavelengths of 117 channels
are also obtained. The even SNRs of 37 dB over the L-band generated by
small pump-power of 100 mW could be more efﬁcient for external
optical ampliﬁcations in practical applications. The broad multiwave-
length spectrawith the FSR of 0.4 nm covering the full L-band are useful
for the applications of DWDM andWDM-PON communication systems.

interferences due to the same optical path for the forward and the backward propagations of lights. Herein, the 
reshaping effect of the dual-pass UISI occurring at the polarizer-1 could obtain the interference spectra with deeper 
modulation depths. The free spectra range (FSR) of the comblike spectra can be adjusted to meet the ITU grid 
spacing requirements by a specified precise length of the PMF, which can be estimated by the 
formula
!" # "
2 /(!n $ l) [10], where !n and l  respectively are the birefringence and length of the PMF. Because the 
first interferences of the dual-pass UISI with optical path difference (OPD) accumulates from the polarizer-1 to 
polarizer-2, the length of the PMF required is two times the needs for the single-pass UISI to obtain the same FSR. 
     To confirm the above theoretical prediction by experiments, let the NPR-IDL dual-pass UISI disconnect with the 
resonation cavity. The lengths of the PMFs used for the dual-pass scheme is double than for the single-pass scheme 
so as to obtain the same FSR in two comblike spectra for analyses. And then a super luminescent diode (SLD) 
source is used to directly input the port-1 of the 3-port-circulator; the lights forward to the UISI via the port-2 and 
then reflected from the mirror to the port-3 via the circulation of the port-2. The spectra are measured at the output 
of port-3 by an optical spectrum analyzer (Ando 8610), which obtains the results as shown in Fig.2. The line 
diagrams in red and green respectively represent the comblike spectra of the single-pass and dual-pass UISIs. The 
results indicate that the dual-pass UISI increases 6-dB modulation depth and decreases 0.02nm of 3-dB-linewidth. 
These results demonstrate that the reshaped comblike spectrum by means of double interferences receives better 
performances so as to confirm the prediction of reshaping effect.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     For multiwavelength lasing, a fiber resonation cavity, compositing of a 980nm-pump laser, a WDM, a piecewise 
of EDF, a polarization controller (PC-2), a 3-port circulator and a coupler, is to gain the lasing-peak powers. The 
pump power operates at 700mW. The EDF is with the length of 8m as the gain medium. The PC-2 is to adjust the 
polarization states. The circulator is to guide the lights to the NPR-IDL dual-pass UISI. Finally, the coupler 
connected with the circulator is with splitting ratio of 10% as the laser power output. Regarding the block diagram 
of the NPR-IDL dual-pass UISI, a coil of single mode fibers (SMFs) with the length of 2Km is to accumulate the 
rotation phases of the NPR effect. The NPR effect results from the high-density powers of lights propagating 
through the SMF. The higher power densities of lights could induce the larger polarization rotation angles. The 
larger rotation angle with respect to the optics axis of the polarizer obtains a smaller transmissivity, which is the 
effect of IDL. The combination effect of NPR and IDL could suppress the mode competitions in erbium-doped fiber 
fiber resonation cavities so as to obtain inhomogeneous broadening effects for multiwavelength lasing.  
 
3.  Discussions and Conclusions 
The same length of PMF used in the two schemes of UISIs is for the comparisons of the two lasing spectra. The 
resolution of the OSA is set at 0.01nm to measure the lasing spectra of fiber lasers that respectively incorporate the 
single- and the dual-pass UISIs. The 2-dB-flatness range of the measured spectrum indicating a FSR of 0.36nm, a 
SNR of 47dB, a lasing bandwidth of 5nm, 17 lasing peaks and a lasing linewidth of 0.027nm are obtained by the 
single-pass scheme, of which the spectrum are shown in Fig.3.  Another 2-dB-flatness range of measured spectrum 
having a FSR of 0.72nm, a SNR of 60dB, a lasing bandwidth of 7nm, 11 lasing peaks, and a lasing linewidth of
