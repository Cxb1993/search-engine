I. Literature Review and Project Objectives 
Recently the so called “cognitive radio” networks have attracted tremendous interesting of many 
researchers. Several good survey papers can be found in [1, 2, 3] and references listed there in. The NTIA 
(National Telecommunication and Information Administration) frequency allocation chart shown as in 
Figure 1 [4, 5] indicates multiple allocations over the frequency bands. Obviously, within the current 
regulatory framework, spectrum is a very scarce resource. On the other hand, the actual spectrum usage 
measurements (see Figure 2) indicate low utilization in some frequency bands [4]. The FCC’s Spectrum 
Policy Task Force also reported vast temporal and geographic variations in the usage of allocated 
spectrum [6]. This report indicates that at any given time and location, much of the prized spectrum lies 
idle (the utilization of the assigned spectrum range from 15% to 85%). Therefore, the dynamic spectrum 
access has been proposed to solve these current spectrum inefficiency problems. 
Dynamic spectrum access techniques allow the cognitive radio networks to operate in the best available 
channel. The scenario of cognitive radio networks is illustrated in Figure 3. In the figure, there are two 
kinds of users. One is the primary (licensed or legal) users, the other is the CR (cognitive) or secondary 
users. The basic idea of cognitive radio networks is to share the rare spectrum resource. In other words, 
the CR users have to sense the unoccupied spectrum bands and try to use them for transmission while 
avoiding the interference to primary users. The cognitive radio technology includes the following 
functionalities.  
1. Spectrum sensing: The CR users have to determine unused spectrum portions and detect the 
presence of licensed users when a user operates in a licensed band.  
2. Spectrum decision/management: The CR users can select the best available channel.  
3. Spectrum sharing: The CR users coordinate access to this channel. 
4. Spectrum mobility: The CR users have to vacate the channel when a licensed user is detected.

II. Problem Statement  
In this project, we investigate the spectrum sensing problem in the cognitive radio networks. It is well 
known that the importance of reliable detection of primary users is twofold: 1) it ensures that cognitive 
radios would not interfere with primary users, which permits secondary use of their spectrum; 2) creates 
spectrum opportunities for capacity increase of cognitive networks [7]. In order to realize this function, 
cognitive radios must have significantly better sensitivity and wideband frequency agility than 
conventional radios. Therefore, a spectrum sensing implementation requires novel designs of not only 
wideband RF/analog circuits, but also digital signal processing and network cooperation techniques in 
order to meet such challenging requirements [8]. Here, we focus on the spectrum sensing in the aspect of 
signal processing.  
The system structure of the distributed spectrum sensing in cognitive radio network considered here is 
shown in Figure 5. In the cognitive radio network system sunder consideration, there are several 
Secondary Users (SUs), a Base Station (BS) and a Primary user (PU). The main objective is that the 
SUs have to detect if the spectrum band is being used by the PU. As mentioned earlier, the strategy to 
determine whether a spectrum band is vacant is the heart of CR techniques. For single SU spectrum 
sensing context, the energy detection [9, 10] and cyclostationarity-based detection [11, 12] have been 
employed in CR network problem [8, 13, 14, 15]. As we know, under the scenarios of severe channel 
fading and hidden nodes, it is more possible for a single SU to make a wrong decision. The distributed 
(cooperative) spectrum sensing scheme that can improve the performance of spectrum detection has 
attracted a lot of attention and shown some fruitful results [16−24], the key idea of which is that spectrum 
detection decision is based on the ones of multiple distributed SUs instead of a local SU alone. In Figure 
5, each secondary user (SUi, i = 1 to N, if N secondary users is assumed) makes a spectrum detection 
 6
 
Figure 6  Parallel configuration of a distributed spectrum sensing 
 
Though there have been several different cooperative spectrum sensing schemes presented in the 
literature [16−24, 38−43], in this project we investigate a new paradigm of distributed spectrum sensing 
for cognitive radio networks, namely, a flexible hybrid decision scheme for distributed spectrum detection 
in CRN under communication constraints. A distributed spectrum sensing for cognitive radio network can 
be modeled containing a number of scattering located secondary users that observe a common 
phenomenon and a data fusion center (base station) that makes a final decision. The secondary users are 
linked to the base station by transmission channels. If there is no limitation on transmission bandwidths, 
all the raw data (or local likelihood ratio) at secondary users can be transmitted to the global decision 
maker for data processing. In this case, signal processing becomes centralized in nature and conventional 
optimal procedures can be implemented at the fusion center. In many practical situations, there are 
limitations on the transmission bandwidth. Also, secondary users are provided with processing 
capabilities. In this case, secondary users pre-process their observations individually and convey the 
compressed version of secondary user data to the fusion center where the received information is 
appropriately combined to make the final decision.

Due to the cyclostationary property, the magnitudes of )(lS y
α of the modulated signal are nonzero for 
certain values of α ; on the other hand, Gaussian noise does not exhibit cyclostationarity and its 
magnitude of )(lS y
α  will go to zero for 0≠∀α . Numerical simulations for this property are shown in 
Figure 8. Let the transmitted signal be a BPSK modulated signal and Td is the data rate of BPSK signal. 
We carried out the spectral correlation density in frequency domain for N = 1024 and d/T4=α .The 
simulated conditional probability density functions (PDF) of )(lS y
α  can then be plotted as in Figure 9.

densities for different values are shown in Figure 11. It can be seen that only when d/T4=α  the spectral 
correlation density has a peak. In this case, the spectral correlation density for transmitted BPSK signal 
will be much different from that of noise.  
The robustness analysis for energy detector and cyclostationarity-based detector are presented in Figure 
12 where BPSK modulation is used.  It can be seen that the cyclostationarity-based detector has a better 
robustness in weak signal case. Similar statement can be found in [39].

3.2  A paradigm of distributed spectrum detection for CR networks  
The distributed spectrum detection for CR networks to be considered is shown in Figure 6. The joint 
conditional densities are assumed known and modeled by the energy detection schemes stated earlier. In 
this decentralized spectrum detection problem, the idea is to partition the LLR (observation space) at each 
secondary user into three disjoint regions, i0ℜ , i1ℜ and i2ℜ , i= 1, · · · ,N, and assign the corresponding 
value to ui; i.e.,

where ri is the random vector at SUi and Li(ri) is the local likelihood ratio (LLR) at the ith SU. When i2ℜ , i 
= 1, · · · , N, are null sets, the local SUs make a hard decision only, and this kind of problem has been 
studied in [20, 21]. On the other hand, when i0ℜ and i1ℜ , i = 1, · · ·, N, are null, the problem reduces to a 
centralized spectrum detection problem. In this case, conventional detection procedures can be 
implemented. Thus, the decentralized spectrum detection problem under consideration here is an 
intermediate problem between the hard decision decentralized spectrum detection problem and the 
 12
fusion center (base station) and all the other local SUs remain fixed. We rewrite Rrisk of (12) in terms of the

The right-hand sides of Eqs. (14) and (15) are denoted as )()(20 k
kt r  and )()(12 k
kt r , respectively. The 
left-hand sides of these two equations are ratios (likelihood ratios). Therefore, the decision rules can be 
specified by these two parameters )()(20 k
kt r  and )()(12 k
kt r  located on the real line. The decision rules in 
Eqs. (14) and (15) must be satisfied simultaneously when a solution exists. Obviously only the case  
)()(20 k
kt r  ? )()(12 kkt r  satisfies these two decision rules simultaneously. Therefore, the decision rule at 
Sensor k can be expressed as

Examining the right-hand sides of Eqs. (14) and (15), we see that )()(12 k
kt r  and )()(20 k
kt r  depend on the 
observation rk. Thus the local decision rules in those equations are not, in general, threshold tests. 
However, if we assume that the sensor observations are conditionally independent, these decision rules 
reduce to threshold tests.

and local decision rules are related to each other and also based on the fusion rules 
)2 ,1 ,0),|1(( 0 == jjup ku , these (2M + 3M) equations are coupled. A simultaneous solution of these (2M 
+ 3M) nonlinear coupled equations under the M constraints of the form in Eq. (17) yields the PBPO 
solution to this flexible hybrid decision scheme in the Bayesian sense. The computational difficulty of the 
above PBPO solution is quite obvious. 
3.3 System Design Based on Ali-Silvey Distance Measure [29-34] 
Motivated by the difficulty and excessive computational requirements of PBPO system design obtained 
in the preceding section, a simplified design procedure based on the class of Ali-Silvey distance measures 
is presented in this section. In general, this is not an optimal procedure, but it reduces the computational 
difficulty considerably. The local sensor decision rules are obtained by maximizing the Ali-Silvey 
distances between the conditional densities at the input of the fusion center under the constraint given in 
Eq. (17). The optimal fusion rule based on a likelihood ratio test at the fusion center remains the same as 
stated in Section 3.2.

when the constraint 10 ≤≤ iR  is satisfied. Results for this case with m = 1 are also shown in Figure 14. 
Figure 14 shows two pairs of threshold ),( 10
oo tt  and ),( 10
BB tt . It can be seen that the two thresholds of 
each pair are equal when Ri = 0, namely, the local sensors (SUs) make a hard decision only. Using the 
thresholds obtained at local sensors and the optimal fusion rules, we show the probability of error as a 
function of Ri in Figure 14. Both system designs achieve the optimal centralized detection system 
performance (Pe = 0.23975) when Ri = 1, i = 1, 2. When Ri = 0, i = 1, 2, these two system designs reduce 
to the appropriate decentralized detection system where only hard decision is made at each sensor and 
AND/OR rules are employed at the fusion center (BS). The local decision rules based on the 
Bhattacharyya distance result in a suboptimal design procedure for 2  ,1  ,10 =<≤ iRi , but less 
computational effort is required. The difference in system performance between the design that minimizes 
Pe and the design based on the Bhattacharyya distance is most significant when the a priori probabilities 
are equal; i.e., the worst case occurs when 2/110 == ππ , and this is the case considered here. The 
trade-off between bandwidth requirement(average communication rate) and system performance is 
evident for both system designs. When Ri is closer to 1, say Ri = 0.7, system performance is fairly close to 
the performance of the centralized system.

This new spectrum access aspect introduces unique functions at the physical layer: reliable detection of 
primary users and adaptive transmission over a wide bandwidth. Obviously, the strategy to determine 
whether a spectrum band is vacant is the heart of CR techniques. In this project, we have investigated the 
spectrum sensing issue at the physical layer. The investigation on these raised issues will impact both the 
theoretical and practical research on in cognitive radio networks.
