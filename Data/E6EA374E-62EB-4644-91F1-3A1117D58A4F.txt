1. Introduction 
Balanced circuits are widely used in 
modern communication systems due to their 
good common-mode (CM) rejection capability, 
which results in higher immunity to the 
environmental noise as compared with their 
single-ended counterparts. A variety of RF 
and microwave components such as filters, 
low-noise amplifiers, mixers, and power 
amplifiers have been seen implemented in 
balanced topologies more in recent years than 
ever. In particular, balanced topologies are 
favored by circuit modules implemented using 
integrated-circuit (IC) technology because the 
need for vias to connect devices on one of the 
metal layers in an IC to a ground reference on 
another may be reduced [1]. 
For a balanced BPF to be competent, not 
only should its differential-mode (DM) 
operations meet passband specifications, but 
its CM transmission must also be 
appropriately suppressed for the frequency 
range of interest. Hence, the design of a 
balanced BPF appears to be more challenging 
than that of a single-ended one. Coupled-line 
structures have been proposed to construct the 
balanced BPFs in [2], and coupled-resonator 
structures have been employed to form the 
ones in [3] and [4]. Although novel and 
performing extremely well, these balanced 
BPFs are suitable for single-narrow-band 
operations only. For wideband and 
ultra-wideband operations, multi-stage 
branch-lines have been demonstrated to be 
effective in the design of balanced BPFs [5, 
6].  
The balanced BPFs mentioned so far are all 
single-banded, either narrow or wide or 
ultra-wide. There are indeed demands for 
balanced dual-band BPFs since dual-band 
operations are required in many modern 
wireless-communication systems. In [7], a 
balanced dual-band BPF was designed using 
two unequal-electric-length (UEL) stepped- 
impedance resonators (SIRs) and two 
uniform-impedance resonators (UIRs), the 
former of which were designed to resonate at 
the two desired DM passband center 
frequencies (corresponding to the odd-mode 
resonant frequencies of the SIRs) and at the 
undesired CM passband center frequency 
(corresponding to the even-mode resonant 
frequency). The two SIRs were meandered to 
provide a self-feedback mechanism so that a 
transmission zero is generated around their 
even-mode resonant frequency. Although 
novel, the notched band around the CM 
transmission zero is not wide enough, leading 
to a minimum CM rejection of only 13 dB in 
1-7 GHz. In [8], two quarter-wavelength 
( / 4λ ) SIRs were designed to resonate at the 
two desired DM passband center frequencies. 
The SIRs and the feeding lines loaded by a 
high-impedance folded section were properly 
arranged in a manner suggested in [2] to form 
an all-stop-like coupling configuration for CM 
suppression. However, the minimum CM 
rejection achieved is only slightly improved to 
15.7 dB in 1-7 GHz, as compared with that of 
the BPF in [7]. Note that the BPFs in [7] and 
[8] are both fabricated using FR4 substrates, 
which are perceived to be of high loss. If a 
low-loss substrate is adopted instead, the 
resulting minimum CM rejection of the BPF 
with the topology proposed in [9] would be 
worse and would not be as large as 15.7 dB. 
Recently, some other dual-band balanced 
BPFs with improved performance have been  
published [10-12]. All these work use coupled 
resonators as main building blocks. However, 
as compared with the number of the existing 
single-ended dual-band BPFs, the available 
balanced counterparts are relative less seen. 
Hence research and development in this area 
are still needed. 
2. Objective of This Project 
This project devotes to the study and 
development of dual-band balanced BPFs 
which are intended for application in WLAN 
systems complying with IEEE 802.11 FH, 
802.11g, 802.11b, and IEEE 802.11a 
specifications. The principles behind 
two-section coupled lines and coupled 
resonator are studied with formula for 
application derived. Example dual-band 
balanced BPFs are designed and verified by 
measured results.

In this project, Equations (4) – (7) serves 
as the basic principles for belanced dual-band 
BPF designs using TSCP.  
(B) Design of Balanced Dual-Band BPFs 
Using Coupled SIRs   
The design methodology for balanced 
dual-band BPFs is similar to that of 
single-ended ones. Namely, for given 
passband center frequency and bandwidth, the 
lowpass prototype filter parameters (g- 
parameters) and related BW-g-parameter 
formulas are used to find the external quality 
factor of input/output SIRs and coupling 
coefficients for internal SIRs. However, the 
challenge of such balanced dual-band BPF 
designs is the suppression of common modes. 
In this project, the method of separating 
common modes of the whole BPF circuit 
(effectively, these pertain to the even modes of 
the SIRs) is adopted. The mode separation is 
achieved by employing the characteristic of 
the plane of symmetry and by stub-loading the 
SIRs of intermediate stages, so that the SIRs 
will have different resonant frequencies while 
in CM operation.  
Application of the aforementioned  
approaches in balanced dual-band BPF 
designs are shown in Section 4.  
4. Results and Discussion 
(A) Dual-Band Balanced BPF Using λ/4 
Stepped-Impedance Resonators and Folded 
Feed Lines [8] 
In the first part of Section 4, a second- 
order dual-band balanced BPF designed using 
 6 
 
Fig. 5 Configuration of the proposed fourth- 
order balanced dual-band BPF using four 
coupled bi-section 2λ  SIRs. 
 The proposed balanced dual-band BPF 
is intended for use in the 2.4-GHz (2.4−2.484 
GHz) and 5.2-GHz (5.15−5.35 GHz) WLAN 
bands and to be printed on a 0.635-mm-thick 
RT/Duroid 6010 substrate with a dielectric 
constant of 10.2 and a loss tangent of 0.0023. 
All the λ/2 SIRs should have the same 
odd-mode resonant frequencies of around 2.45 
and 5.25 GHz, denoted by f1 and f3, 
respectively. Assuming an equal electric 
length for the two sections of these SIRs 
(namely, 1 2 0θ θ θ= = ), the impedance ratio Rz 
= Z2/ Z1 of the λ/2 SIRs can be found to be 
2.42 using ( )1 3 1tan 1zR f fπ− = +  [13]. In 
addition, the electric length of each line 
section is 0 57.27θ °=  at 2.45 GHz. 
Considering the precision limit of the 
fabrication process, the widths of Z1 and Z2 
sections are set to 1.57 and 0.28 mm, 
respectively, which are equivalently 26.43 and 
64 Ω  in characteristic impedance. 
With the dimensions of the basic SIRs 
available, we continue to determine the widths 
and lengths of the coupling gaps between the 
coupled λ/2 SIRs as well as the input/output 
tap positions. To proceed, we set the initial 
goal for the fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of 
the two passbands to be both 7%, which, to be 
on the safe side, is larger than the actually 
needed ones (namely, 3.4% and 3.8%, 
respectively, for the first and the second 
passbands of the proposed balanced BPF). 
Meanwhile, we use a fourth-order Butterworth 
function as the target BPF response. The 
required external quality factor ddeQ of SIRs A 
at the two passband center frequencies can be 
calculated to be 10.93. The coupling 
coefficients between λ/2 SIRs can be found to 
be AB
ddM  = CA
ddM  = 0.059 and  BC
ddM  = 
0.038, where ddMαβ , , A, B,Cα β =  stands for 
the coupling coefficient between SIRs α and 
β  [14]. Once the external quality factor and 
the coupling coefficients are known, the gap 
width and the coupling length between the 
coupled λ/2 SIRs as well as the tap positions 
of the input/output SIRs can be determined by 
parametric studies through simulation [14].  
A prototype circuit of the proposed 
balanced dual-band BPF with structural 
parameters shown in Fig. 5 was fabricated and 
measured to verify its performance. Shown in 
Fig. 6 are the reasonably agreed simulated and 
measured S-parameters against frequency. For 
the DM response, the measured (simulated) 
first and second passbands are centered at 2.44 
(2.45) and 5.25 (5.25) GHz, respectively, with 
3-dB frequency ranges of 2.34−2.55 
(2.34−2.58) and 5.14−5.38 (5.13−5.38) GHz. 
The measured (simulated) minimum insertion 
losses, respectively, are 2.4 (2) and 2.82 (2.33) 
dB for the first and second passbands. For the 
CM response, the measured (simulated) 
insertion loss is greater than 25 (25.6) dB in 
1−7 GHz. Not shown in a figure for brevity, 
the measured amplitude imbalance ( 21 2 1S S ′− ) 
(phase imbalance ( '21 21S S∠ −∠ )) for the first 
band is between 0.214 and 0.318 dB 
(178.31° and 181.61° ) and that for the second 
band is between 0.285 and 0.433 dB 
(177.37° and 182.73° ). The designed BPF circuit, 
with the feeding lines excluded, occupies an 
area of only 19.82 ×  17.92 mm2. 
 8 
Hence, these resonant signals in the input SIR 
A can only be very weakly coupled to the 
output SIR A that is far apart from the input 
one. In addition, although SIRs B can support 
the CM transmission of the BPF around fA1 
and fA3, the signal transmission from the input 
to the output around these two frequencies 
must be weak since SIRs A do not provide 
even-mode resonances around these two 
frequencies.  
 
 
 
Fig. 8 Signal-coupling schematics for (a) DM 
and (b) CM operations 
For validation, a balanced dual-band BPF 
that can be used in the 2.4-GHz (2.4−2.484 
GHz) and 5.2-GHz (5.15−5.35 GHz) WLAN 
bands is designed on a 0.635-mm-thick 
RT/Duroid 6010 substrate. The detailed 
dimensions are shown in Fig. 7. 
Fig. 9 shows the photograph of the 
fabricated BPF, which with the feeding lines 
excluded measures only 19.3 × 20.6 mm2. The 
measured and simulated two-port DM and CM 
S-parameters shown in Fig. 10 are seen to 
agree well to each other. For the DM response, 
the measured (simulated) first and second 
passbands are centered at 2.476 (2.47) and  
5.26 (5.25) and  5.26 (5.25) GHz, 
respectively, with 3-dB frequency ranges of 
2.39−2.56 (2.38−2.56) and 5.14−5.38 
(5.13−5.37) GHz. The measured (simulated) 
minimum insertion losses, respectively, are 2.1 
(2.2) and 2.55 (2.1) dB for the first and second 
passbands. For the CM response, the measured 
(simulated) insertion loss is greater than 33.3 
(32.3) dB over the displayed frequency range 
of 1−7 GHz.

1. Introduction 
 
 One of the most common antenna design for mobile devices is planar inverted-F antenna 
(PIFA) design [1-3], which normally covers the quad-band operation such as global system for 
mobile communication (GSM, 890-960 MHz), digital communication system (DCS, 1710-1880 
MHz), personal communication system (PCS, 1850-1990 MHz), and universal mobile 
telecommunication system (UMTS, 1920-2170 MHz). Although this antenna design is attractive for 
achieving multi-band and broadband operations; however, it requires a top radiating patch that 
locates above the system ground plane, with a height commonly fixed at around 6 mm, thereby 
potentially increasing the thickness of the mobile devices. With the rapid growth in mobile 
communications, it is not until recently that dual-network system applications such as the wireless 
local-area network (WLAN) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) are 
also being considered to incorporate into the mobile devices [4-5]. Hence, in this paper, a hexa-band 
internal printed co-planar antenna is proposed due to the advantages such as low-profile and easy to 
fabricate at low cost. Besides the ability to cover the usual GSM/DCS/PCS/UMTS band, the 
proposed antenna also includes the dual-network band operating at WLAN (2400-2480 MHz) and 
WiMAX (2500-2690 / 3400-3600 MHz). Details of the antenna design are described, and the 
measured results of all fabricated prototypes are presented and discussed.  
 
2. Antenna Design 
 
 The geometry of the proposed internal printed co-planar monopole antenna fabricated on a 
single side of a FR4 substrate is depicted in Figure 1, showing a simple CPW-fed design occupying 
a small area of 50 × 16 mm2. Note that the lower left corner of the rectangular-shaped radiating 
element is linked back to the lower co-planar ground plane along the isolation slit, which in turn 
shorted to the circuit ground plane of 99 × 50 mm2. Two slits, slit 1 and slit 2, of length 21.5 and 
25.5 mm, respectively, are embedded parallel to each other on the radiating element.  Impedance 
matching can be achieved by tuning the gap distance between the radiating element and the CPW 
ground plane, which in this case is 2 mm.   
 
3. Experimental Results and Discussion 
 
 The fabricated prototype antennas are initially studied by using the simulation software, and 
since the measured return loss results are well related to the simulated one, only the measured data 
is presented in Figure 2. In this figure, it demonstrates that the proposed antenna is stemmed from 
studying prototype A antenna (without embedding slits 1 and 2), which can excite a triple resonant 
modes at 960, 2250, and 3571 MHz. Besides these 3 resonant modes, if only slit 2 is embedded 
(prototype B), an additional mode at 1813 MHz will be stimulated due to the current distribution 
along this slit, and if only slit 1 is loaded (prototype C), an additional mode at around 1900 MHz 
will also be excited. Hence, by loading both the slits onto prototype A, the proposed antenna is 
formed and interestingly, improvement in impedance matching are observed for the lower (GSM) 
and upper (WiMAX, 3.5 GHz) band centred at 955 and  3353 MHz, respectively, with a measured

GHz WLAN通訊系統之雙頻平衡式帶通濾波器，兩個通帶可由式當設計SIR之長度
與調整其兩節維帶段之阻抗比來輕易達成。另外，藉由於內層兩個SIRs中央加
載T型開路殘段之方式，使該兩個SIRs之共模頻率與外側兩SIRs者錯開，如此讓
共模訊號無法於級間得到有效之耦合而被衰減，藉此可設計出差模特性極佳且
共模拒斥比高之施用雙頻平衡式帶通濾波器。
The proposed balanced dual-band bandpass filter (BPF) which is
intended for application in WLAN systems is consructed using bi-
secton stepped-impedance resonators. The two designated passbands can
be easily designed by properly choosing the impedance ratio of the
SIR. In addition, by loading at the centers of the two inner SIRs
with T-shalpe open stubs to shift their even resonant-mode
frequencies, the common-mode (CM) signals can effectively be
attenuated. Thus a balanced BPF with good DM characteristics and high
CM suppression can be obtained.
