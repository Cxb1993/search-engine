Abstract
The research aims to investigate the
relational impacts of inputs and outputs
among intelligence capital, corporate
governance and firm value, and to further
analyze companies’ relative operational 
performance for offering insights into how to
enhance firm value and improve operational
performance. It takes the 31 listed and
over-the-counter companies of the
semiconductor manufacturing industry in
Taiwan as examples. The relevant secondary
data is colected from the firms’ financial 
statements, annual reports, and related
database between 2004 and 2007. This
research refers domestic and international
important literatures in light of actual
conditions then analyzes and classifies
relevant measurement variables into proper
dimensions. There are 10 inputs (6 items of
intelligence capital variables plus 4 items of
corporate governance variables) and one
output (operating profit ratio) sieved out as
critical measurement variables. The analytic
hierarchical process (AHP) method is then
employed to obtain the prior information
from experts. Therefore, Data envelopment
analysis (DEA) and assurance region (AR)
models (i.e. DEA/AR) with the weighted
inputs/output by AHP are adopted to perform
efficiency analyses and slack analyses. In
addition, the Malmquist productivity index
(MPI) is applied to measure effectiveness
changes in a time span of four years from
2004 to 2007. The research attempts to
propose a reasonable, objective, and effective
4模式比較分析。而本研究最終目的乃提供半
導體製造公司未來改善經營績效與提昇其
公司價值之參酌依據，故採取投入導向
(input -oriented) 模式 (AR-I-C、AR-I-V) 進
行分析。
四、 實證分析結果
(一) AHP分析結果
由於本研究涉及智慧資本、公司治理等
相關專業知識之領域，故問卷調查對象係以
具半導體電子相關產業領域背景之資深經
理為主共15人。其中（7人）約有一半具碩
士學歷，且有60% （9人）具有10以上之相
關工作經驗。本研究利用AHP 取得專家之
先驗資訊，即由彙整專家意見之AHP相對權
重中，挑出所篩選出之投入與產出項，分別
計算其間權重比值（如表6），最後再將其代
入 DEA/AR 模式中進行加權DEA資料比
較分析。
(二) 效率分析
有關 2004~2007 之 DEA/AR 模式
(AR-I-C、AR-I-V)，各效率平均、規模報酬、
及參考集合次數，如表 7 所示。其中漢磊、
德律、元隆電、全新、及全懋共五家最具生
產效率，故最常為其他相對無效率廠商參考
學習標竿。整體而言，國內半導體製造廠商
之總技術效率平均偏低 (0.379)，此顯示多
數廠商之生產效率須改善空間甚大，而其經
營效率不彰主要源於純技術效率無效率
(0.543)。故國內半導體製造廠商應更積極引
進新技術，提升技術面之生產效率。而由規
模報酬分析，多數廠商屬於規模報酬遞增
(IRS)，此表示這些半導體製造廠商需增加
投入，擴展其經營規模。此外，德律、漢磊
之純技術效率平均值為 1，台積電 (0.985)
則接近 1，代表近四年來，此三家廠商之皆
達到純技術效率有效率，顯示其技術面生產
最為穩定。而規模效率平均值方面，僅全懋
(0.974) 較接近 1，此表其經營規模趨於最
適經濟規模。另外，將 2007 年資料權重設
限 修 正 之 DEA/AR 模 式 (AR-I-C 、
AR-I-V)，求得新的效率值，與原模式 CRS、
VRS 之效率與排序之比較彙整於表 9。由表
9 得知各評估單位在修正模式 (AR-I-C、
AR-I-V) 下之 CRS、VRS 效率值、平均效
率值與有效率之 DMU 個數均有普遍下降
趨勢。從整體平均相對效率值而言，原模式
之 CRS (0.908) 與 VRS (1) 之平均效率值
亦分別大於 AHP 修正模式之 AR-I-C
(0.425)、AR-I-V (0.526) 平均效率值，故若
採用先驗資料對權重設定相對範圍，則評估
結果將呈現較少之 DMU 數。亦即在智慧資
本與公司治理二者對公司價值之影響時，透
過權重設限修正 DEA 模式分析可求出更
貼近於真實的效率值。
(三) 差額變數分析
差額變數分析可使廠商瞭解資源使用情
形，不僅可作為目標設定之基礎，亦能提供
無效率單位改善空間與幅度之相關資訊。有
關 2004~2007年DEA/AR 模式(AR-I-V) 之
差額變數分析列於表 10。
(四) 生產力變動分析
有關 2004~2007 年國內半導體製造廠
商之生產力變動效率在各年間之變化情形
如表 11 所示。其技術效率變動之幾何平均
數為 0.920，此顯示半導體製造廠商之整體
技術效率在過去四年略為衰退。而總技術效
率變動係由純技術效率變動與規模效率變
動所形成，在純技術效率變動方面，僅有 1
家廠商純技術效率呈現進步趨勢，其餘 29
家廠商未變動，純技術效率變動之幾何平均
數為 1，此顯示半導體製造廠商之整體純技
術效率在過去四年維持穩定不變。在規模效
率變動方面，有 5 家廠商規模效率呈現進步
趨勢，13 家廠商未變動，有 12 家廠商規模
效率呈現衰退趨勢，規模效率變動之幾何平
均數為 0.920，此顯示半導體製造廠商之整
體規模效率在過去四年略為衰退。
茲將五種效率變動之三個跨期分析結
果 (2004 年~2007 年) 彙整於表 12。並將此
效率跨期變動情形繪製於圖 1。發現 2006
年為半導體製造廠商效率較好之一年，故其
效率變動多呈成長趨勢。相反地，2005 年
與 2007 年則是效率表現較差之年度，特別
是 2007 年，與其前一年度 2006 年相較，其
效率衰退幅度非常劇烈。由此可見，近年國
內半導體製造業正面臨嚴峻之挑戰，故其必
須亟思改革突破，以提升其經營效率。
五、 結論與管理意涵

technology which is proved to be the important core of organizations. Hence, the development of
semiconductor industry having high dependence on information technology will be regarded as
the mainstream of world economy, since it can not only explain the reason why enterprises can
have sustainable competitive advantage but also promotes the quality of human life. Along with
the trend of technology development, the industrial structure and the competitive operating
environment in Taiwan has appeared enormous transformation. The industrial structure based on
process manufacturing as main source of economical creation is gradually declining. Instead, the
semiconductor industry with fast innovation of technology and short product life cycle has
become the main driving force forTaiwan’s economy.
Traditionally, most of resources used for gaining competitive advantage primarily consist of
tangible assets such as land, raw material, equipment, labor force, and so on. If enterprises can
grasp these tangible assets then they are able to perform mass production to earn profits and
create higher market value. However, in the recent years, the market value of numerous
companies of knowledge-intensive industries has far surpassed the book value of shareholders’
equity. And this has an obviously expanded tendency (Hansson, 1997；Lev, 2001；Hussi and
Ahonen, 2002). However, generally speaking, the difference between market value and book
value is closely related to the increasing importance of intangible assets. Therefore, knowledge,
technology as well as knowledge workers, and so on, namely, which are so-caled “intelectual
capital,”play a critical role in assessing firm value for companies, and it also causes intellectual
capital to gradually receive considerable attention (Lev, 2001).
In addition, while enterprises are encountering a rapid change of competitive environment, for
enhancing organizational performance, it is necessary to strengthen corporate governance by
request of information transparency, differentiation and low cost, to reach the ultimate goal of
creating firm value. Corporate governance is the balanced control mechanism designed by a legal
system. It can be used for promoting operational efficiency, and enable maximizing firm value.
Besides, diffusion of related information through the indicators concerned with corporate
governance can win investors’ trust and support; and furthermore, it can obtain the fund in both
domestic and foreign capital markets to carry on essential investment and development, and
maintains own competitive ability. Therefore, to guarantee return on assets for stakeholders and
creditors, and avoid the internal management taking up or wasting company resources, corporate
governance is an effective way to solve such a proxy problem resulting from separating
ownership from operating authority. And through shareholding of both internal and external
shareholders to increasing incentive of oversight of the executives can reduce the proxy cost for
enhancing firm value (Jensen & Meckling, 1976；Shleifer & Vishny, 1986；Yeh & Lee, 2004).
In the theoretical and practical angle, there have been increasingly studies focusing on intellectual
capital recently. Although most of the related research generally approves that intellectual capital
has impact on firm value, the degree of influence on companies by intellectual capital remains
unclear so far. The previous relevant researchers put emphasis on the definitions and discussions
of the dimensions (Hansson, 1997；Lev, 2001；Hussi & Ahonen, 2002). Some stress more on
comparisons among dimensions (Joia, 2000；Bontis, 2001；Ohlson, 2001), or even only on
analysis of a single factor (McElroy, 2002；Sullivan, 2000；Yeh & Lee, 2004). However, there is
still lack of research at exploring relationship between inputs and outputs while taking account of
how the two dimensions, intellectual capital and corporate governance, can affect firm value.
Research scope and objectives
Therefore, this research takes the public listed semiconductor manufacturing companies in
Taiwan as examples. The relevant data is collected from the annual financial reports of these
corporations between 2002 and 2005 for assuring credibility and accessibility. The research scope
focuses on exploring operational efficiency of the semiconductor manufacturing industry of

FIRM VALUE
The creation of firm value lies in upgrading customers’interests, lowering costs of organizations,
or increasing interests and reducing costs at the same time (Snell et al., 1996). More specifically,
the firm value created by reducing costs of organization is derived from operation of excellence,
whereas, the firm value enhanced by promoting customers’interests either results from close
customer relationships, or from products and services in the leading position (Treacy &
Wiersema, 1993).
Definition and variables measurement of firm value
To improve the increasingly differences between book value and market value of enterprises,
caused by difficulty in measuring intangible assets in nature, many scholars have actively
involved in development of intangible assets measurement. Since there are a wide variety of
methods for measuring firm value, based on the purpose of the study and data availability, the
primary principles of selection are: 1. using the public financial information, so as to increase the
feasibility of measuring; 2. having consistent standards for different characteristics of companies
to ensure that the measured data are comparable; 3. providing measurement for both internal and
external stakeholders such as managers, investors and pressure groups; 4. making methods used
relatively simple and clear; and 5. with help for company strategy and performance management.
Therefore, in accordance with the above principles of screening, the study is intended to use
operating profit ratio, Tobin's Q value, or return on assets (ROA) as variables for measuring firm
value (Sveiby, 2001; Pike et al., 2002).
Relationship between firm value and organizational performance
Organizational performance refers to achieve corporate objectives by accomplishing the
effectiveness of business units, functional departments, transaction processes, and individual etc.
Therefore, it is a standard for measuring outcome. The conceptual framework of organizational
performance proposed by Venkatraman and Ramanujam (1986) is divided into three dimensions:
1. Financial performance: return on investment rate, sales growth rate, and earnings per share
which are the most commonly strategy used for the traditional conceptualization; 2. Business
performance: non-financial performance indicators such as market share, new products release,
product quality, and marketing effectiveness etc.; and 3. Organizational performance: various
conflicting objectives to reach organizational objectives and objectives to satisfying both internal
and external stakeholders are also included, in addition to financial performance and business
performance,
The use of public information has enhanced the feasibility of measuring firm value. And
compared with the traditional way of measuring organizational performance, the assessment of
firm value has more contribution on overall performance measurement. From the financial
perspective, firm value assessment is an active motive confirming corporate value, and creating
potential value after evaluation (Peppard & Rylander, 2001).
INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL
With the advent of the 21st century, for enterprises, the most important barrier to entry the era of
knowledge is that whether they have the ability to collect and synthesize intellectual capital
together into effective applications (Stewart, 1997). Enterprises have been gradually integrating
resources of knowledge into their strategy. And it makes the situation of lacking management of
16
In the financial point of view, corporate governance refers to a compound set of relevant
mechanisms reducing the proxy problems between managers and shareholders; whereas from a
corporate perspective, corporate governance is concerned with the responsibilities of
management and board of directors for company’s operations. And according to the corporate
governance principles formulated by OECD, corporate governance framework should ensure that
companies can immediately disclose the correct information (OECD, 2004). Based on the
previous study (Yeh & Lee, 2004), corporate governance contains the factors such as board
composition, ownership structure, management configuration, intervention of stock market by the
largest shareholders, and transactions from excess related parties.
Relationship between corporate governance and firm value
Ohlson (2001) stresses that for enterprises evaluation it is important to take account of the
concept of information beyond financial statements and to make the relevant management and
public investors realize that, a solid mechanism of corporate governance is one of the key
elements of both enterprises evaluation and sound capital market. Corporate governance has
become such an important issue because that in addition to the effect of internationalization, the
increasing risk of business decision-making has significant influence on operational performance
as well. Therefore, in today's complex business environment, there is no one business manager
has sufficient ability to bear all the responsibility and risk of decision-making. Consequently, a
sound mechanism of corporate governance is relatively required for achieving the definitely
positive results of enhancing the quality of decision-making, reducing corporate risk, and
increasing firm value.
DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS
CCR model and BCC model
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a method that applies the concept of envelope in making
decision through an analysis of the portfolio of inputs and outputs of all the evaluated units to
identify the points (units) having the minimum inputs or maximum outputs. Such points are the
optimal solution. And connecting each point in the optimal solution becomes an envelope curve,
which is called “eficiency frontier.”
The decision-making units (DMU) on the efficiency frontier are assigned an efficiency score of
one and are relatively efficient; while all other DMUs are assigned efficiency scores of less than
one, but greater than zero, and are relatively inefficient. And the relatively efficient DMUs can be
viewed as the appropriate benchmarking for the relatively inefficient DMUs.
The DEA method, which is based the concept of fragment production curve to estimate efficiency
measurement of the border, is derived from Farrell in 1957 (Farrell, 1957).
In term, DEA, is a non-default production function to replace the default production function
commonly used in general statistics. It is a nonparametric frontier technique and adopts the
concept of relative comparisons using mathematical programming methods to calculate efficiency
frontier; and measuring production efficiency of the DMUs with multiple inputs and outputs.
The DEA analysis contains two models: CCR (Eq. (1)) (Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes, 1978) and
BCC (Eq. (2)) (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984). The CCR model assumes that an increase in
the input(s) yields a proportional change in the output(s), and such a case is called
constant-returns-to-scale model (CRS); whereas the BCC model assumes that an increase in the
input(s) yields an increasing or decreasing change in the output(s), and such a case is called
variable-return-to-scale (VRS). The two models are different in the efficiency measure: the CCR
model produces an overall efficiency measure (i.e. technical efficiency and scale efficiency)
whereas the BCC model generates a pure technical efficiency measure. This study uses a
input-oriented BCC model in examining the pure technical efficiency of semiconductor
manufacturers, assuming that the average productivity at the most productive scale size may not

RESEARCH DESIGN
In this research, according to the characteristics of semiconductor industry, the factors relating to
intellectual capital and corporate governance are synthesized underlying the literature review.
The DEA method is employed in the empirical study using the collected secondary data of
financial information.
Proposed research framework
As described previously, the proposed research framework of the DEA model is shown in Figure
1. Both of the variables used for the inputs and outputs in the DEA model are generalized from a
collection of relevant literature and discussions of experts after deleting the improper variables
for semiconductor industry.

Definitions and measurement of the inputs and outputs
The inputs contain two dimensions: intellectual capital (including three selected items) and
cooperate governance (including five selected items); and the output consists of only one
dimension, firm value (including three alternative items). The definitions, measurement, and
main resources of the selected variables for inputs and outputs are summarized in Table 3.

Analysis results of all data collected during 2000-2005
This study used both of the CCR model and BCC model to analyze firm value of Taiwan's
semiconductor manufacturers by intellectual capital and corporate governance. According to
various inputs and outputs selected by the research, through the implementation of the CCR and
BCC models of DEA obtains technical efficiency (TE) and pure technical efficiency (PTE) of
semiconductor manufacturers respectively, then scale efficiency (SE) is derived from technical
efficiency divided by pure technical efficiency.
Any DMU with TE score equal to 1 is a relatively efficient unit. Or, if TE score of any DMU is
less than 1, then the DMU is relatively inefficient unit. That is, the inefficient units must reduce
inputs or increase outputs to become more efficient units. Similarly, the DMUs with PTE score
equal to 1 are located on the efficiency frontier. If the SE score calculated by the BCC and CCR
models is less than 1, it indicates the inefficient DMU must increase or decrease inputs to achieve
scale efficiency. In this study, by data collected during the period 2000-2005, the selected inputs
and outputs for each mode as shown in Table 4 are tested for the DEA evaluation models. Table 5
lists the summary of relative efficiency of three evaluation models (Modes 1-3) during 2002-2005.
As presented in Table 5, compared with the relative efficiency of the assessment results of the
three modes using outputs: operating profit ratio (Y1), Tobin's Q (Y2), and ROA (Y3), it was
found to Mode 1 using operating profit ratio (Y1) as the output, had a proportion (22.1%) with
both overall efficiency (TE) = 1 and pure technical efficiency value (PTE) =1; while it had a
higher ratio (71.1%) with both the overall efficiency (TE) ≠ 1 and pure technical efficiency
value (PTE) ≠1. And this indicates Mode 1 has sufficient discriminability. In addition, the inputs
of Mode 1 are distributed averagely in both of the two dimensions (IC and CG) (see Table 4).
Accordingly, as presented in Table 4, Mode 1 using one output (Y1) and eight inputs (i.e. H5, H6,
I1, I3, S1, S2, T2, and SS1), is adopted in this research for discussion and analysis. And the
results of relative efficiency analysis by Mode 1 (Y1: Operating profit ratio) are summarized in
Table 6. It shows that“F2.TSMC”and“F4. TMC”are the only two semiconductor manufacturers
which keep as relatively efficient companies in the overall period of 2002-2005.

production should be expanded or reduced in order to provide managers with latest information
about operational scales, as a reference for future competition with other companies. As presented
in Table 8, during 2002-2005, obviously, the about half of these semiconductor manufacturers
have increasing returns to scale (IRS); while only a few have decreasing returns to scale (DRS).
This indicates that the investment of most Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers is still
insufficient, and the scales of these manufacturers with increasing returns should be expanded to
achieve optimal scales of production.
Benchmarking reference and efficiency classification
The reference set includes relatively efficient DMUs with efficiency score of 1 that can be
benchmarking targets learned by ineffective DMUs with efficiency score less then 1 for
improvements. As introduced previously, the efficiency score calculated by the BCC model is
pure technical efficiency (PTE) and in the practical operations and output scale of the DMU, it
can reflect whether the input resources are efficiently utilized to meet the minimal inputs.
Therefore, the PTE scores derived from BCC is applied to find out efficient DMUs with PTE
score of 1, of which the reference sets consist. The yearly reference frequency for each efficient
DMU is shown as Table 7. And the relatively efficient companies listed in the reference sets can
be benchmarking targets for inefficient companies. Based on the analysis results, it can be found
during 2002-2005,“F3.Macronix”is the most distinguished semiconductor manufacturer since
it is referred more frequently (31 times) then followed by“F4.TMC”(23
times),“F32.CWPT”(21 times), and“F9.MOSPEC”(14 times), respectively. And this
demonstrates these relatively efficient companies having the strongest robust efficiency become
the benchmarking targets among the manufacturers within the industry.

CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS
Efficiency measurement is the foundation of improving efficiency. And for effectively utilizing
resources, through the results of measurement, organizations can understand their advantages and
disadvantages, and the realization of the existence of environmental opportunities and threats as
well. Especially confronting the highly competitive competitors, semiconductor manufacturers
must be aware of their own position and orientation, attempting to improve its operating
efficiency for attaining the goals of increasing productivity, reducing costs, and enhancing the
competitiveness of products. This study performs a DEA analysis to establish an evaluation
model of operating efficiency by intellectual capital, corporate governance, and firm value. It
attempts to assist semiconductor manufacturers in assessing their own core competitiveness and
focusing their resources on specific areas to effectively raise their firm value. The conclusions,
managerial implications, and suggestions of future research are briefly summarized as follows.
Conclusions
From analysis of results, it found that during the four years, in 2002 the overall efficiency (TE) of
Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturers is in the bottom of all, while the one in 2004 is the
highest. However, there exists a gradually increasing tendency of overall efficiency during the
four years. Such a tendency shows that the semiconductor manufacturing industry is making a
continuous progress of growth along with global economy recovering slowly, whereas there is
still substantial room for improving the overall allocation of resources. The technical inefficiency
results largely from an improper decision-making or resource allocation of semiconductor
manufacturers. Nevertheless, it found that from 2002 to 2005 the yearly average of pure technical
efficiency (PTE) appeared relatively stable. Additionally, the research results show that from
2002 to 2005, the total number of the semiconductor manufacturers with SE scores equal to 1 had
a slightly increasing trend. And this demonstrates the scale efficiency of the semiconductor
manufacturers in Taiwan is in course of improving. Furthermore, despite near one thirds of
Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers having constant returns to scale (CRS), almost half of
the semiconductor manufacturers have increasing returns to scale (IRS). This indicates that the
investment of these semiconductor manufacturers is not adequate yet, and the scales of these
companies should be expanded to attain optimal scale of production.
According to slack analysis, during the period of 2002 to 2005, for inefficient semiconductor
manufacturers in Taiwan, the input magnitude of most needed improvement is “Operating profit
per employee” folowed by “Employeeadded value.” And this demonstrates that the inefficient
companies should make more efforts on improving these inputs. In addition, from 2002 to 2005,
although the average inputs were invested too much, there is a decreasing trend yearly. And it
reveals the related semiconductor manufacturers can utilize resources more efficiently then ever.
Based on the analysis results of DEA, the operating efficiency of intellectual capital and
corporate governance of semiconductor manufacturing companies should be not only confined to
the size of companies. Some companies such as VPEC, CWPT, and MOSPEC are relatively
small. Compared with other manufacturers their inputs and outputs are not so much; however, in
this study it implies that these three companies are efficient units. Therefore, it infers the smaller
manufacturers can still make good use of their intangible assets and better effective corporate
governance to achieve high operating efficiency.
Managerial implications
Semiconductor manufacturing is recognized as a capital-intensive and technology-intensive
industry and used to be called “wafer foundry” in the past. Therefore, many people consider
that such a foundry industry has both low threshold of technique and low value added. However,
in fact, semiconductor manufacturing industry is not like a general type of electronics industry.
As Taiwan's economy has entered the developed countries, plus the technology of semiconductor
industry has reached more mature stage, so that employees’ basic wages and operating costs are

一、參加會議經過
本研討會議 (2008 International Conference on Business and Information, 2008BAI) 主要在
韓國首爾 Marriott 飯店舉行，為期三天 (07/07~09)。而本會議係由台灣資訊系統研究學會
(Academy of Taiwan Information Systems Research, ATISR) 主辦。本次研討會議參加者非常踴
躍，共約有五、六百名國際專家學者分別來自將近四十個不同國家，其中包括學術界之研究
者、以及實務界主管、經理人員等；並邀請自世界各大學之專業領域的著名教授專家參與。
本研討會之議題共分「企業與管理 (Business and Management)」，「會計、經濟與財務
(Accounting, Economic and Finance)」，「管理資訊系統、電子商務與網際網路 (MIS,
e-Commerce and Internet)」，「非營利、休閒與社會事件 (Non-Profit, Leisure, Social Issue and
Others)」，「行銷、電腦、科技與系統 (Marketing，Computer Science, Technology and Systems)」，
以及「生產與科技管理 (Operation and Technology Management)」等共進行兩天五十三場次，
本人選擇幾個研究主題較為接近或相關之場次參加，俾便與研究領域相近之國際學者專家，進行交流
互動。而本人之論文發表場次則安排於研討會第二天（8 日）上午「Session [A1]: Business and
Management」，因事先已將報告資料充分準備，故順利完成發表，且有數位學者發問，進行熱烈討
論與溝通，並獲得許多寶貴意見；此外，本人與幾位同行教授亦出席當日中午之接待會，除與多位
來自台灣教授會面餐敘外，並與其他國家之學者專家寒喧致意。
二、與會心得
本人發表論文之研究主題探討台灣半導體製造業之經營效率，其主要係以智慧資本與公
司治理之資料衡量公司價值以評估經營績效。所使用資料為 2002~2005 年台灣 33 家上市櫃
之半導體製造廠商之公開公司年報資料，運用資料包絡分析法（Data Envelopment Analysis,
DEA）進行分析，即分別以「智慧資本」（四項投入：「每人營業利益」、「員工附加價值」、「研
發費用率」、及「研究發展強度」）及「公司治理」（四項投入：「大股東持股比率」、「超額關
係人資金往來比率」、「大股東股權質押比率」、及「最大股東現金流量」）為投入構面、與「公
司價值」（「營業利益率」）為產出構面建立評估模式。因受限於時間與資料取得，本論文
僅先藉由 DEA 中的 CCR、BCC 模式求得半導體製造業廠商之整體相對效率值及規模報酬分
析、以及差額變數分析瞭解目前資源使用狀況與找出可以改善之方向與幅度大小。未來研究
