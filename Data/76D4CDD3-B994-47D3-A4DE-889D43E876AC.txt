Abstract. For the past two decades, several design support tools have been developed for both research and 
commercial purposes. Most are stand-alone tools; few are comprehensive or collaborative design 
environments. Agent technology is an emerging field and agent-based application design is still a pioneering 
discipline.  The agent-oriented design is a new generation method of programming design that mainly uses 
the script language as a basis for development and that is suitable to design the multi-agent application system. 
Some tools have adopted the notion of computational agency. In the urban design environment, suppose 
design objects such as pavements, lamps and plazas can look after themselves and have its own behavioral 
mechanism, where would a design object acquire the knowledge that allows it to interact intelligently? This 
paper investigates the question through the notion of objects as agents in design and the purpose of this 
research is to propose a coordinative mechanism of agents of spatial objects by establishing this design agent.  
Introduction and Purpose 
 
“A Pattern Language” [1] is written by Christopher Alexander in 1977. The implied key thought is to presume 
that certain structured features will not change with time during the construction process in an artificial 
environment. And these features will dominate mankind’s living behavior along with the generative ways of a 
spatial environment. In other words, the internal mechanism which can be systemized by humans’ thoughts 
and the pattern which can be offered for general operation are hidden be-hind these structured features. 
Similar design questions can be solved in similar ways. A pattern, whose content consists of the description of 
problems and solutions as well as the relevant situations or contextualized information, is used to record a 
general solution corresponding to a problem.  
 
The same stance is held in this research; that is, more design patterns can be extended if designers can pass 
on the developed knowledge and accumulate results, yet, the research method in this research is different 
because the real world keeps developing and changing with time, and an object changes when an incident 
occurs at a certain point in time, and the occurrence of the incident makes the object have spatial change or 
change in property [11]. Furthermore, new methods, new tools, and new media are also constantly updated. 
And, in recent years, professional designers tend to employ control and simulation of programs, and to 
communicate information through the Internet. Digital computing tools have apparently become the

language is also called “the glue language”. The script language whose structure is simpler and easy to modify 
is adopted in this research. The “direct translation” of the script is used as an operational way so that there is 
no need to compile it. It allows the designers to use the simple way to finish the provision and operation of 
pattern units in the future, which makes it more correspondent with the important principles of creating and 
designing the script language. 
 
In recent years, many scholars have proposed the interactive script mechanisms to control agent behaviors 
[3]. “Q-Language”, an interactive script mechanism proposed by Professor Toru Ishida, Department of Social 
Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, in 2003, is similar to the humans’ natural language pattern. Its purpose 
is to target the web-based agent system whose internal agent behavior can interact with users by means of the 
files driven by the script description, and further to assist the application of simulation of crowd movement 
management in disasters in the urban public space of the real world.  In the Q-Language [4], three major 
elements are required; they are Cue and Action, Guarded Commands, and Scenarios. A script file written with 
the Q-Language can propel the agent behavior after it is equipped with the above three elements. However, 
these elements and the definitions of signs are not easy to understand. Therefore, for the convenience of users 
to write the script file, the Q-Language designs an editing interface in the tabulated form. All the designers 
have to do is simply to fill the content in the table, and then the content in the table can be converted to the 
standard Q-Language description file by means of the implemented compiler. Therefore, through the 
interaction mechanism inside the script, pedestrians will respond and trigger specific event behaviors at the 
most of the time when they detect other objects or collisions in an environment.  
 
The motivation to trigger the behavior can be roughly divided into two: the event-driven random behavior 
and the scripted behavior. To let the pedestrians show different kinds of decision-making power in the crowd 
simulation, users can only have the partial control right although they can manipulate the pedestrians’ 
activities. The pedestrians will maintain part of rule-based behavioral autonomy. Even the degree of 
behavioral intensity and feebleness can be shown with a parameterizable behavioral model. Varied behavioral 
patterns are adjusted in terms of different targets. And the generation of random numbers or the direct 
modification in a simulated status is also included. 
1.2   A Society of Agents 
Intelligent Agent (IA) is a branch developed from Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence which started 
from 1950 helps human beings solves problems by simulating how human beings think and solve problems. 
And the “agent”, as defined in Webster’s New World Dictionary: 
 An agent is something that produces or is capable of producing an effect or someone who is authorized to 
act for or in the place of another.  
From the above definition, it can be seen that the agent has two characteristics; that is, the agent will 
execute the things and represent others. As far as the hardware is concerned, the robot is one kind of agents. 
As for the software, for instance, in the studies of Wooldridge and Jennings [9], the agent is considered a 
computer system situated in an environment and can flexibly and automatically represent certain acts in order 
to complete the given goal. Ferber [2] defines the agent as a real or virtual software or hardware which can

stationary point. 
(3) The location and distance of furniture which attract pedestrians’ attention: take C from Fig. 1 for 
example, fountains can easily become objects which attract pedestrians’ attention, or visual focuses. Therefore, 
elements such as the relationship between fountains and commercial plaza environments, the distance at 
which the pedestrians who are attracted stand, size and location of the fountains as well as the possibility of 
attracting people and diverting crowds all affect the attraction of fountains in commercial plaza.

3 Behavioral Mechanism of Coordinative Agents 
To define agents and their roles in play, we develop scenarios, suppose design objects such as pavements and 
lamps can look after themselves. A scenario consists of some scenes. A scene is used for describing state 
transitions. Scenarios include agents and actors. Every scenario involves at least one agent and one goal; they 
include sequences of actions, events and characteristic elements. Each scenario is described as state transitions, 
and states semantic is depending on cues and actions. 
 
For example, if a commercial plaza for 30 people to gather, to sit down, to chat, and to observe the scenery 
is decided, then “Pavement-Agent” must be coordinated to complete the planning requirements for the 
properties including the shape, acreage, and color. On the other hand, “Seat-Agent” must also be coordinated 
to adjust suitable combination positions and quantities to complete the goal together. The Lamp-Agent and 
Pavement-Agent’s actions are defined by state and based on the distance and location plot, the Lamp-Agent 
can communicate with the Pavement-Agent or another agent. Coordinative agents responsible for coordinative 
function of behavior need to be added if excellent coordination is required for action dependencies among the 
agents when a script function is executed; that is, to complete a design goal, see Fig 2.

other dependent objects will be automatically notified in order to make the corresponding updates. Then, the 
relationships among the categories of objects are converted to the agent concepts. 
 
What’s more, in the process of the above coordinative script, it is suggested in this research that the 
following two items must be clearly defined: (1) Use the agent pattern to establish the representative objects; 
that is, to let the Spatial-Object have substitutes. (2) Let the representative objects control the interaction 
between a certain Spatial-Object and the environment. The ways of communication and control of relevant 
agents of Spatial-Object must be simplified. Moreover, Agents can presume all the different individuals, such 
as the space element, furniture on the street, plants, and lamps, to be regarded as single individual of behavior. 
How these different agent individuals interact with one another is the research point in this research. This 
model will be able to assist experts to express the knowledge of spatial configuration in the future, and to 
provide students or beginners to conduct the exploration of spatial configuration. In the subsequent study, the 
completed pattern script will be input into the platform system for use. It can be a knowledge database of net 
groups for design agents to continue its growth. And the coordinative mechanism of the agent inside the 
pattern library can be as a reference for subsequent relevant academic researches on the development of 
computer auxiliary design, which is an emerging technology, in the field of architectural surroundings.
