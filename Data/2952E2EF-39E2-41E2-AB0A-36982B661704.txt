water film recedes faster with increasing heat load 
and the critical heat loads are significantly 
reduced.  In contrast, the critical heat loads for 
methanol and acetone seem hardly affected by 
different wettability conditions.  The minimum 
evaporation resistances, however, remain unaffected 
by surface wettability for all the three working 
fluids.  In grooved heat pipes, longitudinal liquid 
recession with a steep-sloped liquid front can be 
visualized above a certain heat load for all the 
three fluids.  Behind the short liquid front is the 
accommodation region where the meniscus appears to 
anchor on the top corners of the groove walls.  With 
increasing heat load, the liquid fronts gradually 
leave the heated zone, accompanied by increasing 
plate temperatures.  Water exhibits the best 
performance with highest maximum heat loads and 
lowest evaporator resistances.  However, the 
differences in the maximum heat loads for different 
fluids are much smaller than the differences in their 
figures of merit.  No boiling is observed in the 
groove wick for all the three fluids.  With the 
groove-powder evaporator, the evaporation performance 
is greatly improved for water.  But the improvements 
for methanol and acetone are not as significant as 
for water.  Condensation modes for the three fluids 
are also compared.  Dropwise condensation is observed 
for water, and film condensation for methanol and 
acetone.

Chapter 1 Introduction 
     
Heat pipes or vapor chambers have been widely applied in electronics cooling due to their 
superior heat spreading capability [1-3].  In these two-phase heat transfer devices, the wick is 
crucial to their thermal performance because it plays an important role in the evaporation and 
condensation of the working fluid as well as the flow of the condensed liquid back to the 
evaporator.  Most practical types of wick can be powders, meshes, grooves, their combinations.  
Visualization studies on operating heat pipes have provided important insights of the 
characteristics of heat pipe operation [4-8].  Through the glass wall of a transparent heat pipe 
having a non-sintered multi-layer mesh wick, Wong and Kao [4] observed water boiling under 
heat loads above certain threshold values.  Under suitable water charges, boiling could again 
diminish under elevated heat loads with the effective thin film evaporation prevailing on the fine 
bottom mesh.  Lips et al. [5] visualized the behavior of methanol in a vapor chamber with a 
groove wick machined on a copper plate.  Boiling was observed in the copper grooves for heat 
fluxes higher than 3 W/cm2.  Liou et al. [6] investigated the evaporation characteristics of water 
in sintered multi-layer copper mesh by visualization and evaporator resistance measurement.  
Continued study [7] was performed for sintered copper-powder wicks and composite 
mesh/powder wicks.   Both [6, 7] revealed the absence of boiling for sintered wicks thinner 
than 1 mm.  Pure evaporation prevailed under heat fluxes up to 148 W/cm2 even with abundant 
nucleation sites on the irregular-shaped powders.  Using working fluids of smaller surface 
tensions, such as methanol and acetone, weak boiling was observed in a sintered mesh wick 
under high heat fluxes prior to the occurrence of partial dryout [8].  In the multi-layer mesh 
wicks or sintered-powder wicks, the liquid thickness gradually decreased with increasing heat 
load before dryout occurred [4, 6-8].  Concurrently, the evaporator resistance gradually 
decreased prior to dryout.  This agreed with the concept that the evaporator resistance is 
proportional to the liquid thickness in the wick, since the major heat route passes through the 
wick metal and the thin films near the metal-meniscus interlines [9].   
The heat pipe performance has been known to depend on a number of factors, such as liquid 
 3
vapor chambers, a finite exposure time in air is inevitable.  If the object temperature is still high 
or the elapsed time is too long, the wick capillarity would significantly degrade and thereby 
impair the performance of heat pipes. 
    From the view of interface physics, the liquid film at the contact line can be divided into 
three regions: non-evaporating thin film region, the evaporating thin film region, and the intrinsic 
meniscus region, depending on the relative role of the disjoining pressure [16-22].  In the 
non-evaporating thin film region, the disjoining pressure completely suppresses fluid evaporation.  
In the evaporating thin film region, the film thickness slightly increases to a degree that both the 
disjoining pressure and the capillary pressure due to the curved liquid surface are controlling.  In 
the intrinsic meniscus region, the film becomes thick enough that the disjoining pressure is no 
more influential to evaporation.  Evaporation mainly occurs at a very narrow band covering the 
micro region of the intrinsic meniscus and a part of the evaporating thin film region, as the low 
thermal resistance of the thin film is most favorable to evaporation.  Recent analyses [19-22] 
have revealed that the thin film evaporation is closely related with pore size, surface tension, 
latent heat, and polarity of the liquid, etc. 
    Heat pipe performance is dictated by the thermal resistance and the maximum heat load, 
both highly related with the characteristics of the evaporator wick.  Recently, the thin film 
evaporation mechanism has been applied to heat pipes with simple-geometry grooved wicks or 
wire-core wicks [23-25].  A smaller contact angle is shown to result in smaller thin film 
thickness and evaporation resistance.  It is noted that the contact angle and disjoining pressure 
were uncoupled in these models.  However, the contact angle increase with copper surface 
oxidation is related to the lowering of the surface energy and hence the disjoining pressure.  A 
heat pipe model accounting for this coupling is yet unavailable.  For complex-geometry mesh 
wicks or sintered-powder wicks, comprehensive theoretical analysis would be extremely difficult.  
Our experimental studies [6, 7] visualized that surface evaporation prevailed in water-charged 
heat pipes with sintered copper-mesh or copper-powder wicks.  No nucleate boiling was 
observed for a wide range of test conditions.  Along with increasing heat loads, the water film 
 5
Nilson et al. [31] theoretically studied the evaporating flow in rectangular grooves.  Based on 
mathematical analysis, they identified different regions for a steady evaporating flow in 
horizontal capillary grooves.  In the accommodation region, the meniscus remains attached to 
the ridge corners while the meniscus radius progressively decreases down to a minimum value 
below which the meniscus becomes detached from the ridges.  In the other corner-flow region, 
the meniscus recedes into the bottom corners of the groove.  The decreasing meniscus radius in 
the entry region assists in the capillary liquid flow toward the corner flow region.  Between the 
two regions is a steep-slope transition region as the meniscus detaches from top corners and 
attaches to the groove bottom.  This jump-like variation of liquid surface results from the 
constant meniscus radius over a uniform groove width.  With no axial capillary pressure in this 
dead zone [28], its axial extent is minimized.  The shape of the transition region strongly 
depends of the height/width ratio of the groove [31].  To our knowledge, this interesting finding 
has not been reported experimentally. 
 
1.3 Objectives 
In this work, we will study the effect of copper surface wettability (or hydrophilicity) as well 
as the wick type on the evaporation characteristics of flat-plate heat pipes.  The surface 
wettability is quantified by the static contact angle of a sessile water drop on the smooth copper 
surface right at the evacuation of the heat pipe.  For different static contact angles, the 
evaporation resistances will be measured with increasing heat load up to the maximum heat load, 
with the evaporation process visualized.  Tests will be conducted for three different working 
fluids: deionized water, methanol and acetone with a two-layer mesh wick.  As far as grooved 
wicks are concerned, a groove and a composite powder-groove evaporator will be investigated.  
On one hand, the present experimental results not only reveal the effect of copper surface 
wettability on the heat pipe performance; on the other hand, the present data are also useful for 
fundamental understanding the evaporation mechanisms in sintered porous wicks and groove 
wicks.

under a fixed pressure in a 850 ℃ hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h.  Before sintering, the 
screens and the copper plate are carefully cleaned.  The heat pipe has a glass top wall for 
observation.  The internal space of the heat pipe is 120 × 30 × 7 mm3.  With the contact 
surfaces between different pieces sealed with o-rings, the whole structure, including the wicked 
copper base plate, the top glass window, and stainless-steel frames, is tightened with bolts.  For 
the methanol and acetone tests, anti-corrosion Aflas® o-rings are used.  A fixed volume of 
degassed working fluid was filled into the heat pipe right after it was evacuated down to a 
pressure of 1 × 10-2 Torr.  The heat load was increased stepwise from a low heat load, and data 
were taken under a thermally stable condition for each heat load. 
The thickness of the sintered 100+200 mesh wick was 0.26 mm.  The 100 mesh screen has 
a wire diameter of 0.114 mm and a wire spacing of 0.14 mm; the 200 mesh screen has a wire 
diameter of 0.055 mm and a wire spacing of 0.07mm.  The wick porosity was 0.6, determined 
using the density method.  The effective conductivity of the dry sintered wick was 16 W/mK, 
measured following the ASTM D5470 standard test method.  Detailed description of our 
effective conductivity measurement has been given in our earlier work [6]. 
The degradation of copper surface wettability in air with time results from the formation of 
Cu2O, faster for a higher plate temperature and environmental humidity.  In this work, the 
surface wettability was quantified by the contact angle of a sessile water drop on a smooth copper 
plate.  The surface of this plate had been reduced along with the wicked heat pipe base plate in 
the sintering oven and both were taken out of the oven simultaneously.  When the assembled 
heat pipe was evacuated to 1 Torr, the static contact angle was measured on the smooth plate.  
With different elapsed times in the room air, different contact angles were obtained.  Fig. 2.3 
presents the static contact angles of 5 µl water drops measured at different elapsed times in air at 
25-30 ℃.  These data were collected over an experiment period of about three months with wide 
variation of humidity.  The somewhat scattered data points may result from the fact that the 
contact angle growth rate is influenced by both environmental temperature and humidity.  
Nonetheless, it is shown that the contact angle increased roughly linearly with the elapsed time,

shortly above the center of the evaporator was denoted T11, which reflected the vapor 
temperature leaving the evaporator center.  The vapor temperature above the center of the 
condensation section was monitored by T12. 
The parallel capillary grooves were chemically etched on a 4 mm-thick C1020 oxygenless 
copper base plate.  Fig. 2.7 shows the top view of the grooved plate assembled in the heat pipe, 
with the positions of the heater, the cold plate and the trenches marked.  The cross-sectional 
structure of the grooved heat pipe is shown in Fig. 2.8.  The grooved area on the base plate was 
115 mm × 26 mm, with 65 grooves.  Through the glass window, the whole grooved area can be 
visualized. The cross-sectional dimensions of the grooves are illustrated in Fig. 2.9.  The 
U-shaped grooves had a top width of 0.25 mm and a depth of 0.16 mm.  The top width of the 
groove walls was 0.15 mm.  To further create a powder-groove wick, fine irregular copper 
powders (diameters < 75 µm) were filled in all the grooves covering a 24 mm length from the 
evaporator end.  The wicked copper plate was then sintered in an 850  ℃ hydrogen/nitrogen 
atmosphere for 2 h.  The top view of the sintered powder-groove wick is shown in Fig. 2.10. 
Before each test, the wicked copper plate was carefully cleaned and then put in a 
high-temperature hydrogen/nitrogen environment to remove the surface oxide.  This process 
ensured a good copper surface wettability.  For all the tests, the static contact angles of water on 
a smooth copper surface were controlled at 10°-12°.  Both methanol and acetone fully wetted 
the copper surface. 
For the grooved heat pipes, the evaporator resistance Re was determined as 
  Re = (T4 – T11)/Q, [K/W]           (3) 
where Q = Qt – Qcond.  In this study, the ratios of Qcond/Qt were limited to 13 % for water and 20 
% for methanol and acetone, before a complete dryout within the heated zone.  In general, 
Qcond/Qt was higher for a larger evaporator resistance when more heat would travel through the 
base plate to the cooled zone.  There were at least two reasons for high lateral conduction in 
groove-wick experiments.  First, the cross-sectional size of the grooves was larger, leading to

Chapter 3 Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 Effects of Surface Wettability on the Evaporation Performance of Mesh-Wicked Heat 
Pipes 
Fig. 3.1 compares the evaporation resistances (Re) versus heat flux for water at a charge of v 
= 0.9 ml with respect to the static contact angle, θ0.  The values of Re are obviously smaller for a 
largerθ0 before the critical heat loads.  Visualization revealed earlier water film recession in the 
evaporator for a larger θ0, apparently resulting from the lower wettability.  However, the 
minimum values of Re are about the same for various θ0.  This point will be discussed later.  In 
addition, the critical heat load, beyond which partial dryout appears, decreases with increasing θ0, 
or decreasing surface wettability.  According to Eq. 1, the capillary force provided by the 
evaporating wick is proportional to cosθ, where θ is the apparent contact angle at the meniscus 
contact lines.  Since the wick was identical, the critical heat loads for different tests should be 
proportional to cosθ.  It is known that the apparent contact angles θ under evaporation are larger 
than the static contact angles θ0, with larger deviation for stronger evaporation [1, 2].  To exhibit 
the relation between critical heat load and contact angle, we plot qcr,θ/qcr,10° versus θ0 in Fig. 3.2, 
along with the curve of cosθ0 for reference.  For θ0 > 30°, qcr,θ dropped more than the reduction 
associated with cosθ0, implying stronger amplification of contact angle should have been present.  
However, with a smaller critical heat loads for a larger θ0, the weaker evaporation therein could 
not be fully responsible for the enhanced amplification of contact angle.  Further explanation is 
needed.  From the microscopic view for thin film evaporation, the attraction force for liquid 
flow comes from both the disjoining pressure and the capillary pressure, while viscous friction is 
the main resistance force.  According to the theoretical comparison between water and other 
non-polar fluids [21] and between polar and artificial non-polar water [22], a high polarity 
induces a much thicker evaporating thin film as well as a stronger disjoining pressure.  The 
much thicker film would result in less friction, although water has a higher viscosity than other 
fluids.  In the present cases with a lowered copper surface energy but unaltered polarity, we 
 19
of water, the film would be thinner and the disjoining pressure would be weaker [21, 22].  For 
these fluids, the relative role of the friction force grows with reduced film thickness.  Kim and 
Wayner [10] indicated that, for completely wetting liquids, friction force is the controlling factor 
in the thin evaporating film region where the apparent contact angle θ is determined.  In other 
words, the thin film evaporation process associated with a less-polar fluid should be less sensitive 
to disjoining pressure variation than for a highly polar fluid.  Consequently, the reduced copper 
surface energy still could draw a similar amount of the less-polar and lower-surface-energy liquid 
into the evaporating thin film region, as it can effectively spread these liquids under no 
evaporation.  A mathematical model, such as in [19, 21-23, 25], can be used to examine in detail 
the effect of varied solid surface energy on the thin-film evaporation characteristics for working 
fluids of different surface tensions and polarities. 
Considering the minimum Re, again the surface energy exerted negligible effect for both 
methanol and acetone, as for water.  However, slightly larger minimum Res were obtained for 
acetone and methanol than for water.  This has been explained in [8].  Upon the occurrence of 
dryout at the end of the evaporator, acetone was visualized to have the largest average liquid film 
thickness, primarily as a result of its low surface tension.  For copper heat pipes or vapor 
chambers charged with methanol or acetone, their performances in both critical heat load and 
minimum Re would be nearly unaffected if the wick is exposed in air for up to 3 h. 
No nucleation boiling was observed for water, as in our other works [6-8].  Weak boiling 
was observed for acetone near the critical heat loads under different θ0 conditions.  Slow, 
periodic up-and-down motion of the liquid surface resulted from the cyclic bubble growth, 
coalescence and collapse under the mesh.  Similar observation has been reported in Wong and 
Lin [8], where a video showing the periodic meniscus motion is provided.  As for methanol, no 
boiling was observed here, although very weak boiling could be seen in some test conditions of 
[8].

rapidly.  These oscillations did not alter the global thermal stabilization.  Small amounts of 
water can be seen beyond the liquid fronts.  For the present U-shaped grooves, the corner flow 
regions are not as striking as would be expected for rectangular grooves [31].  Non-oscillating 
zigzag front lines have been observed by Lips et al. [5] under a fixed heat load in their 
visualization study on groove-wicked vapor chamber. 
When the heat load was stepwise increased, the liquid fronts appeared after a threshold heat 
load.  In general, the fronts would recede with further increased heat load and gradually move 
out of the heated zone.  Fig. 3.8 describes the variations of the averaged liquid front positions 
with increasing heat load for two representative test cases.  Case (a) represents most test runs 
and Case (d) represents some unusual tests in which some residual water was observed to remain 
behind the receding liquid fronts.  This kind of results will be discussed in detail later on.  In 
Fig. 3.8, the origin of the vertical coordinate x is located at the center of the heated zone, where 
thermocouple T4 was implanted.  The longitudinal positions of T3 and T5, as well as the heated 
zone and adiabatic zone, are also marked.  In Case (a) the liquid front appeared under 14 W at x 
= -2 mm.  With increased heat loads, the liquid front gradually receded and moved out of the 
heated zone for Q > 22 W.  In Case (d), the liquid front appeared under 15.5 W and remained at 
x = 0 mm until 23 W before subsequent recession. 
Fig. 3.9 shows a close image near the liquid fronts of Case (d) at Q = 19 W.  Different from 
other normal cases, such as that shown in Fig. 3.7, residual water spots were visible on the groove 
bottom.  They would finally disappear when Q was increased beyond 23 W.  It seems that these 
spots took the position of the pits on the rough groove bottom.  Also, since dry regions existed 
between the fronts and the water spots, water was probably supplied through the groove corners.  
The surface roughness at the groove bottom was measured using a surface topology optical 
interferometer.  The average roughness was about 0.2-0.4 µm, but at some local spots the 
roughness could reach 1 µm.  It is unclear why in a few tests the residual water would remain, as 
an identical base plate was used.  The effects of these residual water spots will be revealed in 
Figs. 3.10 and 3.11.

temperatures.  It is noted that the values of Qcond/Qt also were significantly lower when residual 
water spots existed. 
The evaporator resistances, determined with Eq. 3, are shown against Q in Fig. 3.11 for 
some representative cases.  Cases (a)-(c) are normal cases and Cases (d) and (e) are 
characterized by residual water behind the receding liquid fronts.  In general, Re first remained 
near a constant low value over a range of Q before it rose in a growing pace in response to the 
expanding dryout zone with increasing Q.  Faster rises in Re manifested in Cases (a)-(c).  With 
these residual water spots, the evaporator resistances remained at lower values until larger heat 
loads.  As the residual water spots appeared to result from surface roughness, groove surface 
roughness may be beneficial to the heat pipe performance. 
 
3.2.3 Evaporation characteristics associated with different types of wicks 
For groove wicks, onset of dryout with subsequent development over the whole heated zone 
is accompanied by a gradual rise of the evaporation zone temperature, as in the normal Case (a) 
in Fig. 3.10.  A similar trend in the Re of commercial φ6mm groove-wicked heat pipes has been 
observed in our lab.  In response to an increasing Q, Re first remained near a constant value for a 
range of Q.  It then began to rise in a gradually faster pace before it ran away.  In contrast, the 
dryout process associated with the mesh or powder wicks is quite different [5, 6, 8].  For these 
wicks, the increasing heat load leads to gradual thinning of the liquid film and concurrent 
lowering of Re.  The onset with subsequent development of dryout usually results in a sharper 
increase in the Re–Q curves [5, 6].  In addition, the present minimum values of Re, 0.1-0.15 K/W 
are significantly higher than those of mesh or powder wicks, which are usually lower than 0.1 
K/W [5, 6].  This can be explained with the following reasons.  First, the capillary force 
associated with present U-shaped grooves with a width of 0.25 mm was considerably weaker than 
the mesh or powder wicks, for which the capillary pores are of O(50 µm).  Second, much 
smaller thin film evaporation areas could be provided with a relatively large groove pitch of 0.4 
mm. 
 25
between Qmax and N of the three fluids in the groove wick will be discussed in Section 3.2.6.  
But the weaker oscillating motion observed for water can be explained now.  In the present 
groove-wick tests, the heat loads for water are only slightly larger.  However, the heat of 
evaporation, λ, of water is much larger than those of methanol and acetone (Table 2.1).  This 
implies smaller volume flow rates for water in the grooves.  Furthermore, the viscosity of water 
is higher.  Consequently, the oscillating motion of water appeared weaker. 
In the present experiments, no boiling is observed in the groove wick for all three fluids.  
In our previous visualization studies for operating flat-plate heat pipes with meshed or powdered 
wicks, no boiling was observed for water.  However, weak boiling was observed for acetone and 
methanol in a mesh wick [8].  Lips et al. [5] observed boiling of methanol in a groove-wicked 
vapor chamber under pretty low heat flux (> 3 W/cm2). 
 
3.2.5 Temperatures and evaporator resistances in groove wick for different fluids 
The base plate temperatures T3, T4, and T5 in the heated zone, as well as the vapor 
temperature T11, are plotted against Q in Figs. 3.14 and 3.15 for the above methanol and acetone 
case, respectively.  The open symbols represent the situation that the liquid front has receded 
over the thermocouple.  The temperatures of T3 and T4 are very close to each other but those of 
T5 are lower due to stronger lateral conduction therein.  Along with the liquid front recession 
(Fig. 3.13), the base temperatures and the vapor temperatures increase continuously as a result of 
enlarging dryout region. 
The evaporator resistances, determined with Eq. 3, are shown against Q in Fig. 3.16 for the 
above methanol and acetone cases, along with a typical water case.  Water exhibits the lowest 
minimum Re, and acetone presents the highest.  The trend of increasing Re with increasing Q 
reflects the gradually receding liquid fronts with enlarging dryout regions. 
    Concerning the criterion for Qmax for the present groove-wick tests, there may be different 
selections.  One could be the heat load when the liquid front just moves out of the heated zone.  
However, this criterion can only be applied to groove wicks because the liquid fronts are 
 27
evaporation, and σ  is the surface tension of the fluid.  This group consists of fluid properties 
and has been defined as the figure of merit N of the working fluid [34].  The second parenthesis 
consists of wick properties, where K is the wick permeability and reff is the effective radius of 
wick pores.  The third parenthesis represents the wick geometry, where Aw is the cross-sectional 
area of the wick layer and Leff is the effective length of the liquid flow path through the wick.  
The parameter θ is the apparent contact angle at the evaporating meniscus interlines and cosθ 
presents the attenuation of capillary pressure by non-zero θ.  The coefficient C is 2 for mesh or 
powder wicks and 1 for groove wicks.  For an identical wick structure and heat pipe geometry, 
  max cosQ N θ∝ .              (5) 
Eq. 5 has been experimentally verified for a mesh wick using water, methanol and acetone as the 
working fluid [8].  In these data, attenuation of Qmax by cosθ is more pronounced for water.  
Since the static contact angle of water is larger than those of methanol and acetone, the apparent 
contact angles at the evaporating water interlines should also be larger.  Furthermore, the total 
evaporating interline area associated with the large-size menisci at the liquid fronts in the groove 
wick is smaller.  (A balance between low capillary pressure and liquid pressure drop with large 
reff and K prevails for the groove wick.)  In contrast, the evaporating area is larger with 
numerous small menisci in a mesh or powder wick.  The local heat fluxes at the interlines within 
a groove wick tend to be higher in comparison with those within a mesh or powder wick.  
Consequently, the evaporating apparent contact angles grow larger in a groove wick since the 
apparent contact angle increases with increasing heat flux [35].  As cosθ decays rapidly for large 
values of θ, more serious attenuation of Qmax is rendered for water. 
    The reason why methanol and acetone operate unfavorably in the powder-groove wick may 
be explained by their smaller surface tensions (Table 2.1) which fail to pump the fluids across the 
porous wick effectively.  Similar observation has been obtained especially for acetone in a 
mesh-wick heat pipe [8] in that it tends to accumulate at the condenser.  For the powder-groove 
wick, the balance is maintained between the larger capillary force from the small powder pores 
 29
methanol.  In Fig. 3.19a, water drops of different sizes condensed on the tops of the groove 
walls.  Tiny water drops are seen to grow very rapidly and coalesce into large drops with their 
width confined by the width of the groove walls.  These large drops keep growing for a while 
before breaking.  The largest drops may reach lengths of a few times the wall width.  Upon 
breaking, tiny drops immediately appear on the open sites and grow and coalesce into large drops 
very rapidly.  The condensation activity is not uniform over the condenser.  In fact, significant 
condensation appears in front of the condenser due to cooling through the copper plate.  
Condensation is strongest near the front part of the condenser and becomes weaker in the rear 
part.  Fig. 3.19b shows the image during the condensation of methanol.  The process is 
quiescent without drop formation.

oscillation distances are observed for water. 
5. The evaporation performance of water in the groove wick is better than those of methanol and 
acetone to a limited extent.  However, water presents much better performance in the 
powder-groove wick in both maximum heat load and evaporator resistance. 
6. No boiling is observed in the present groove wick for all the three fluids; however, agitated 
liquid motion reflects nucleate boiling of methanol and acetone in the groove-powder wick. 
7. Dropwise condensation is observed for water, but film condensation prevails for methanol 
and acetone.
