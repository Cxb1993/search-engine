tilt angle of 45° to the rib normal direction and with its focal zone at the location of a 
small shift from the center of the PTV. Secondly, three split-focus modes were 
temporally switched to form an enlarged thermal lesion. Finally, the transducer was 
rotated to have the acoustic beam emitted from different directions to sonicate the 
PTV. A large tilt angle would result in a large acoustic reflection to effectively reduce 
the acoustic absorption of ribs, and the acoustic beam emitting from different 
directions was able to omit the cooling interval between the sonications since there 
was no overlapping of the acoustic power in the normal tissue in front of the PTV. 
Instead of a complicated framework, this simple ultrasound heating system with a 
proper arrangement and heating strategy was robust to shorten the entire treatment 
time and alleviate the overheating of ribs for breast tumor thermal surgery. 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHOD 
2.1. Ultrasound transducer and heating unit 
A square, spherical ultrasound transducer with a side length of 7 cm, a radius of 
curvature 10 cm, and a frequency of 0.5 MHz was chosen in this study. The 
transducer was split into four equal elements, and three different modes of focal 
power patterns could be produced with a phase difference of adjacent element by 0°, 
90°, and 180° for mode 0, mode 1, and mode 2, respectively. A heating unit of 1x1x2 
cm3 was designed for each sonication, and to achieve a dose optimization within the 
heating unit, a temporal switching and optimal power weighting computation 
technique was employed to obtain a suitable weighting of these three power patterns. 
The switching frequency and heating time were set to be 10 Hz and 10 seconds.  
2.2. Heating strategy  
Considering the symmetry of thermal dose alignment and the total acoustic 
reflection at the soft tissue/bone interface, an angle of ο45  between the central axis 
of transducer and the normal direction of tissue/bone interface was selected. Figure 1a 
shows the arrangement of breast and transducer. The breast was modeled as a 
hemisphere with a diameter of 12cm, ultrasound transducer was tilted with a angle of 
45° toward the breast, and water was filled between breast and transducer as a 
coupling medium. For examining the extent of rib heating, chest wall was modeled as 
a slab of bone with 1 cm thick above the breast. Planning target volume (PTV) inside 
the breast was modeled as a cubic of 8 cm3 and therefore four heating units with each 
1x1x2 cm3 are required. To minimize the overheating of normal tissues in front of the 
PTV, the transducer could be rotated and sonicated from different directions to 
effectively use the acoustic window of the convex shape of breast. In order to have the 
the initial and final time to calculate the thermal dose, respectively, and TD  is 
thermal dose equivalence in minutes. In this study, a conservative value (TD = 300 
minutes) was taken as the threshold of tissue necrosis. 
2.5 Ex vivo experiment 
Based on the simulation study, a corresponding homemade transducer was 
constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of the heating strategy, and the main 
components of experimental set-up are shown in figure 1b. Continuous wave 
sinusoidal signal to the transducer was delivered by a four-channel power amplifier. 
The power amplifier was controlled by software installed on personal computer, 
through which the applied power and phase to each element of the transducer could be 
set. A fresh porcine muscle was used as an ex vivo tissue model, which was placed in 
a C°37  degassed water bath and allowed to reach temperature equilibrium before 
heating. According to the system arrangement in simulation, the tissue in experiment 
was placed on top of a cylindrical water tank full of C°37  degassed water, and the 
transducer was tilted with an angle of ο45  and placed on a stand driven by a 
controllable motor at the tank bottom. Thus through programming motor controller, 
the transducer could be rotated to four planned paths by the desired sequence.  
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 Simulation results 
Figures 2a-c shows the resulting thermal dose profiles on the Z = -2, X = 0, and 
Y = 0 cm planes for the PTV centered at (0, 0, -2) after the treatment was completed. 
The contour curves from the outermost to the innermost indicate the TD equal to 300, 
100 and 1 min. It was observed that the 300 min. TD contour covered the PTV 
adequately, and even though there was not the cooling interval between heating 
phases, the peak temperature of surrounding tissues was still under C°47 and the 
peak temperature of rib was under C°56  for the entire treatment.  
To evaluate the effect of the lesion location on the thermal dose distribution of 
the heating strategy, the same treatment was also simulated for the PTV located at (0, 
0, -3), (0, -3, -3) and (0, 0, -4), respectively. The resulting thermal dose profiles on the 
X = 0 plane for these three locations were shown in Figures 3a-c. It was observed that 
all the thermal dose profiles are consistent with those in the former case. The peak 
temperatures of rib were all under C°44  and it increases as the PTV is closer to the 
rib, while the peak temperature within the breast tissue decreases. 
between sonications and with minimum rib and normal tissue overheating.
