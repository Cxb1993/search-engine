Abstract - Cold roll forming process design based on the 
induction of analytical knowledge by considering material 
and geometry effects is proposed. The analysis engine, a 
finite element based program, is used to analyze various 
multi-stage cold roll forming processes based on pre-
defined process parameters and tooling geometry. 
According to the simulation results, a knowledge-
acquisition procedure based on the construction of a neural 
network model is organized, in which the multi layer 
network and back propagation algorithm are utilized to 
learn the training examples from the simulation results. 
Materials, bending angle and flange width (F) divided by 
thickness (t) have been used as the input layer; Outside 
angle between right flange and web (Spr) and outside angle 
between left flange and web (Spl) have also been used as the 
output layer. The study introduced Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN) technique for modeling the springback angle in the 
cold roll forming. 216 results were used as data sets to train 
the network from the 36 simulation cases. The best results 
were obtained from No-Regularization with single hidden 
layer in the Spr-Spl. These ANN predicted results can be 
considered within acceptable limits. The results show good 
agreement between the predicted and the experimental 
values.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 One of the most important processing methods in the 
manufacturing industry is metal forming. Cold roll forming 
(CRF) is a highly useful and important forming technique to 
obtain long parts with constant cross-sections. It is a 
continuous bending operation in which flat sheet metal is 
plastically deformed along a linear axis, as shown in Fig. 1. 
CRF is used to produce various types of shapes and forms 
such as: channel shapes (U, C, T, Z...), angles, and special 
forms (round, square, pipes…). CRF is a metal forming 
process which is spread throughout the world and today one 
can find roll-formed products in numerous applications, such 
as buildings, vehicles, airplanes, furniture and domestic 
appliances, etc. It is a highly productive process and the use 
of the processes increases every year [1]. 
 The use of a knowledge based system in cold roll 
forming has become a topic of wide interest since the 
original concept [1]. Several prototype systems for multi-
stage process sequence design have been developed. In the 
previous developments, the design rules were based on the 
heuristic approach and past experiences. However, due to 
the lack of universal and reliable human knowledge, it is 
rather difficult to acquire precise design rules from human 
experts. Therefore, the induction of analytical knowledge 
obtained from numerical simulation results is important and 
essential to assist the process sequence design [2]. Fig. 2 
shows a framework for an expert system for a cold roll 
forming process based on finite-element simulation and the 
decision making framework for the current intelligent cold 
roll forming process. 
 The focus of this work is cold roll forming process 
design. An ANN is used to determine the effect of material 
and geometry. Training data are used from simulation of 36 
cases on DYNAFORM-3D software. Material and geometry 
have been used as the input layer; the angles between flange 
and web of production have been used as the output layer. 
The results of system indicate an industrial cases study and 
discussion/conclusions.

II.  FORMING PROCESS DESIGN OF CRF 
A. Previous Works 
 A number of methods have been proposed for modeling 
the CRF process. Neffussi et al [4] proposed a kinematical 
approach for predicting the optimal shape and the deformed 
length of a metal sheet during CRF before the first roll stand. 
Brunet et al. [5-6] developed a computer aided design 
system used to analyze the complete strain history of the 
material and obtain the optimization of the design roll 
profiles. Duggal et al. [7] developed another computer aided 
simulation program, based on deformation mechanics. 
Simulation results were compared with the experimental 
measurements found in the literature. There are many ways 
that the flat sheet can be formed into the desired geometry 
[1, 8]. An example of a flower pattern is shown in Fig. 3 [9]. 
It defines the section geometry at each forming station, 
beginning with the flat sheet and progressing to the final 
section geometry. Walker and Pick [10] presented a method 
of describing the complex deformed geometry of the skelp 
material and defined the strain state in the deformed skelp. 
Wen and Pick [11] presented an investigation of skelp edge

A. FEM as an Analysis Engine 
 The application of a powerful numerical simulation 
technology, such as the Finite-Element Method (FEM), has 
become a very popular approach these days for the following 
reasons: to reduce costly trials in a newly designed die 
before actual forming; to improve tool and die design to 
reduce production and material costs; and to shorten lead 
time in bringing a new product to market by reducing die 
design time. In the thesis, FEM-based software, 
DYNAFORM-3D, has been used to generate analytical 
results for a cold roll forming. 
 The material constitutive models in DYNAFORM-3D 
for elastic-plastic deformation analysis include: rigid for top-
bottom rollers, elastic-plastic for workpiece. The finite-
element analysis is done in a series of steps. Processing steps 
are often done simultaneously, and are often transparent, in 
the computer. The user must intervene in the pre-processing 
stage by providing data in order to construct the geometry of 
the top-bottom rollers and the workpiece, and to define the 
material properties. The detail analysis results, such as the 
angles between web and flange can be obtained. Hence, 
DNAFORM-3D, as an analysis engine, can provide 
information of workpiece, such as profile defects: 
Springback. A symmetrical U-channel is formed by a 
process divided six stands. On each roller, the bending angle 
increase along the forming direction. The roll forming 
process, as shown in Fig. 4, consists of three types for U 
profile: 
 1) Bending angles: 15-30-45-60-75-90 degree, as shown 
in Fig. 5.  
 2) Bending angles: 20-35-50-65-80-90 degree, as shown 
in Fig. 6.  
 3) Bending angles: 25-40-55-70-85-90 degree, as shown 
in Fig. 7. The dimension of the sheet is listed in Table 1. 
 Material data used in the experiment. After that, they 
will import into material data of DYNAFORM-3D. In the 
thesis, it used four material types: Aluminum, Soft Steel, 
Stainless Steel, and High Strength Steel. 
 Angle Velocity of Top-Bottom Rollers is defined by an 
angular velocity and fixed center axis of rollers. In the 
thesis, angular velocity of rollers is 80 rad/sec for two roller 
pairs (as shown Figure 3.4) and 40 rad/sec for different 
rollers. Object interface defines what rollers and workpiece 
can contact with each other. The contact relation parameter 
is used to set the Master/Slave relationship between rollers 
and workpiece. In this thesis, the friction coefficient at the 
interface between rollers and workpiece was set to be 0.125 
(friction type: Forming surface to surface).

 The sheets material used in the experiments were: 
Aluminum, Soft Steel, Strainless Steel, and High Strength 
Steel. The flow stress of strip material was modeled using 
Krupkowsky’s law 
nKεσ =                              (1) 
where σ is true stress, ε is true strain, K is the hardening 
coefficient, and n is the hardening exponent. The material 
data for the current study is listed in Table 2, where E is 
Young’s modulus and ν is Poisson’s ratio.

B. ANN as an Induction Tool

lengths of both sides are the same. However, if the blank has 
wider flange or bigger bending angle of the first stand, the 
springback will be larger. There is no uniform trend for 
springback in Fig. 12 and 13 due to it’s complicate elastic-
plastic behaviour and different blank geometry. However, 
The measured and ANN predicted training data results of 
Spr and Spl are depicted in Fig. 14 which shows good 
agreement among them. Figure 15 depicts the effect of the 
hidden layer number on the RMSE-R^2-MAPE for Spr and 
Spl. The best result is with single hidden layer and No-
Regularization. 
D. Comparison of experiment and simulation 
 The product dimension is shown in the Fig. 16(a), 
where the length is 600 mm. The design pass flower is 
depicted in Fig. 16(b) which contains 9 stands where the 
bending angles are 40, 70, 90, 17, 31, 44, 57, 68 and 76. In 
Fig. 16(a), right flange width and left flange width are 5.5 
mm in the stand No. 1, 2 and 3; right flange width and left 
flange width are 38 mm and 40 mm respectively in the stand 
No. 4 to 9. Material constants are K=673.814MPa, n=0.197, 
E=141509 MPa and ν=0.28. Figures 17 shows the 
comparison of experiment and simulation. The maximum 
and minimum bias between experiment  and simulation are 
2.495 degree at F=5.5 mm, bending angle 90 degree for Spr 
and 0.008 degree at F=5.5 mm, bending angle 70 degree for 
Spl, respectively.  
 
V.  CONCLUSION 
 The thesis introduced ANNs technique for modeling the 
springback angle in the cold roll forming. It used 216 results 
as data sets to train the network from the simulation 36 
cases. The best results were obtained from No-
Regularization with single hidden in the Spr-Spl. For best 
training data, root mean square error (RMSE), the absolute 
faction of variance (R
2
) and mean absolute percentage error 
(MAPE) were found respectively to be 0.900983996%, 
0.999777539%, 2.089021798% in the Spr, and 
0.914537801%, R^2 is 0.999771309%, 2.083336233% in 
the Spl. So, these ANN predicted results can be considered 
within acceptable limits. The best results show good 
agreement between predicted and measured values.
