1. INTRODUCTION 
When using univariate statistical quality control (SPC) methods that include several 
univariate control charts to monitor a multivariate process the correlations between quality 
variables are neglected and false alarms (type one errors) increase. There are two types of 
statistical quality control charts. One type of multivariate SPC has been developed for 
multivariate variable data, such as the Hotelling 2T  chart [5], the Multivariate Cumulative Sum 
chart (MCUSUM) [3,18] and the Multivariate Exponential Weighted Moving Average chart 
(MEWMA) [10]. The other type of multivariate SPC has been designed for multi-attribute data. 
However, multivariate control charts dealing with attribute data are comparatively few. The 
quality characteristics of the multi-attributes process would follow either multivariate Binomial 
distribution or multivariate Poisson distribution. When the focus is on the number of defects 
from each unit and the number of defects is a binary classification, the data could be modeled 
using the multivariate Binomial distribution. For example, the occurrences of missing dots and 
missing lines are serious defects for a liquid crystal display (LCD). Missing dots and missing 
lines are the key quality characteristics of a LCD that are to be jointly controlled. Therefore, this 
study will be focused on the bivariate Binomial attribute control chart. 
Patel [17] proposed a Hotelling type  control chart for monitoring time-dependent 
observations of multivariate Binomial and multivariate Poisson random variables. The correlated 
attributes were monitored simultaneously. Due to its complexity, the scheme has not been used 
2
controls signals. However, no further discussion was made about the out-of-control average run 
length (ARL1). Gadre and Ratthalli [4] developed a likelihood ratio based multi-attribute control 
(LR-MACC) using the exact joint distribution and the LR-test under a multinomial setup. They 
also proposed a procedure to identify which attributes are responsible for the signal. Skinner et al. 
[21] proposed a deleted-Y control chart to detect a shift for multivariate Poisson variables. Run 
lengths for the proposed methods performed better than multiple C charts. Niaki and Abbasi [13] 
transformed multivariate Poisson data such that their marginal probability distributions have 
almost zero skewnesses. The χ2 control chart was then applied to monitor the high-quality 
production process. In another study, Niaki and Abbasi [14] constructed the control limits and 
simultaneous confidence intervals based on the bootstrap method for multivariate Poisson data. 
For multivariate Binomial data, Niaki and Abbasi [15] proposed a skewness reduction approach 
(SRA) to reduce the amount of skewness and then they applied a T2 control chart to monitor the 
process. They conducted simulations to compare the results with the ones from Patel T2 
procedure and the MNP chart. They found that Patel’s method did not perform well. Hence, they 
presented the comparisons between MNP chart and SRA method. The results showed that SRA 
method performed better than MNP procedure in most of mean-shift scenarios. Niaki and Abbasi 
[16] designed a perceptron neural network (PNN) to monitor either the proportions of 
nonconforming in the multivariate Binomial process or number of defects in the multivariate 
Poisson process. They compared the proposed method with MNP and T2 charts for multiple

the approach constructed by Jiang et al. [6] was used for bivariate Binomial data.  
Let variable Yi be the number of nonconforming with respect to quality characteristic i, i = 1,

exists between Y1 and Y2, and marginally Yi, follows a Binomial distribution with parameters ( n , 
) where  is the proportion of nonconforming of the  attribute respectively and n is the 
sample size. Similarly to the approach by Jiang et al., a control chart is constructed for each 
variable. The control limits of two control charts are defined as:

where UCLi and LCLi are the upper and lower control limit of the  attribute respectively, 
and  is the control limit coefficients to minimize the absolute deviation of the in-control ARL 
from the nominal value. If LCLi  0, LCLi will be set at 0. When  are unknown, the value

 In stead of the Shewhart-type 3-sigma (L=3) control limit, the control limit coefficients, L1 
and L2, are chosen to minimize the absolute deviation of the overall in-control ARL from the 
nominal value. It is also designed to keep both individual charts to have approximately the same 
power to detect process shifts. For a specified type I error , the problem can be modeled as an 
optimization problem. We want to simultaneously find L1 and L2 to minimize f1 and f2.

where 
for each attribute was plotted on the control chart for a specified overall   level. A signal by 
any one of the two control charts indicates that the process might be out of control. 
To illustrate the use of the proposed control charts, assume that data follow a bivariate 
Binomal distribution with (n, p1, p2,  ) = (30, 0.1, 0.15, -0.1) in an in-control process (Phase II). 
Example data is shown in Table 1. The proposed method is described in the following steps. 
Step 1: Decide the significance level : Let  be equal to 0.0027. 
Step 2: Calculate the constant factors of control charts  and  using equations (5)(6)(7).

Step 3: Calculate the control limits for each variable by equation (4). These control limits are 
UCL1 = 8.09, LCL1 = 0, UCL2 = 11.15, and LCL2 = 0. 
Step 4: Draw the control limit and plot the data of Table 1 to monitor the process on two control 
charts shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. 
From the Figure 1 and Figure 2, all sample points of first quality characteristic fall in 
control limit, but the 7th sample point of second quality characteristic exceeds the upper control 
limit. Since one of the two charts signals, the process should be stopped for an investigation of 
possible assignable causes.

After generating samples from the bivariate Binomial model, the proposed control charts 
were employed to monitor the process. The performances of different approaches (the proposed 
control chart, MNP chart, and SRA method) were evaluated by ARL with 2000 simulations. 
4.2 In-control ARL 
A simulation study was conducted to investigate the performances of the proposed chart, the 
MNP chart, and the SRA method at an overall nominal value of ARL0 to be 370 ( = 0.0027). 
Data were generated with different combinations of n, p1, p2, and ρ. Table 2 shows the control 
limits of the proposed chart and MNP chart. LCL1 and UCL1 represent the lower and upper 
control limits for the first quality variable. LCL2 and UCL2 represent the lower and upper control 
limits for the second quality variable. The values inside the parentheses are the amount of 
proposed charts are given in Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 for different situations. It is found that 
the performance of the MNP control chart is the worst for all conditions among those three 
methods since the MNP chart is based on the normality assumption. In Table 4, the SRA method 
outperforms the proposed method for the case of n＝10. The performance of SRA and the 
proposed methods are equally likely for the case of n＝30. In Table 5, the proposed method 
outperforms the SRA method for cases of n＝30 and n＝50. However, when the amount of 
skewness is less than one (i.e. r1＝0.57, r1＝0.60) for the case of n＝50, the difference between 
the two methods is not significant. In Table 6, the values of ARL1 are studied for larger amounts 
of skewness (i.e. r1 1, r2 1) for the comparisons. The values of ARL1 for the proposed method 
are generally better than the ones obtained from the SRA method.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
When monitoring the multivariate attributes processes, the correlations between attributes 
are adopted in the MNP chart. However, the MNP chart performs poorly when the normal 
approximation of multivariate binomial distribution is not appropriate. The skewness reduction 
approach (SRA) conquers the drawbacks of the MNP chart. But the ARL0 does no have an 
appropriate value for larger amounts of skewness. In this study, a new control chart is developed 
and shown to be useful for monitoring bivariate Binomial processes. The correlation between
