 follows. 
 
For n = 4, jFj = 1. Suppose that F = Fe. Then Fv = ;. Since 
S4 is edge-symmetric, we may assume that F = f(1243; 
3241)g. Then we construct cycles of lengths6; 8; 10; _ _ _ ; 
24 in the following: 
 
C6: h1234; 4231; 2431; 1432; 4132; 2134; 1234i. 
C10: Replace (4231; 2431) in C6 by h4231; 3241; 2341; 
4321; 3421; 2431i. 
C14: Replace (1432; 4132) in C10 by h1432; 3412; 4312; 
1342; 3142; 4132i. 
C18: Replace (2134; 1234) in C14 by h2134; 3124; 1324; 
2314; 3214; 1234i. 
C8: h1234; 4231; 2431; 1432; 3412; 2413; 4213; 3214; 
1234i. 
C12: Replace (4231; 2431) in C8 by h4231; 3241; 2341; 
4321; 3421; 2431i. 
C16: Replace (1432; 3412) in C12 by h1432; 4132; 3142; 
1342; 4312; 3412i. 
C20: Replace (3214; 1234) in C16 by h3214; 2314; 1324; 
3124; 2134; 1234i. 
C24: Replace (2413; 4213) in C20 by h2413; 1423; 4123; 
2143; 1243; 4213i. 
C22: Replace the subpath h4231; _ _ _ ; 3412i in C24 by 
h4231; 2431; 3421; 4321; 2341; 1342; 3142; 4132; 1432; 
3412i. rewrite. 10 
 
Now consider that F 6= Fe. Then F = Fv and Fe = ;. Since 
Sn is also vertex-symmetric, we may assume that F = 
f4312g. Thus, C6;C8; _ _ _ ;C22 are still cycles in Sn � F. 
Hence, the lemma follows.  
 
For the inductive step, we need to establish (n � 2) disjoint 
paths crossing the given number of subgraphs to guarantee 
that there is still at least one of these paths crossing no fault 
when the number of faults in Sn does not exceed (n � 3). 
Moreover, the endpoints of established paths must be in the 
same subgraph. The following three lemmas discuss how to 
establish the disjoint paths. Then we use the paths to 
construct cycles of required lengths in the last lemma. For 
ease of description, we use ui; uj i ; and (uj)k i to denote the 
ith digits of vertices u; uj ; and (uj)k, respectively. We use 
P or hv0; P; vki to denote the same path where the later 
points the two endpoints of path P. For two paths P = hx; P; 
yi and Q = hu; Q; vi with y and u being adjacent, we use hx; 
P; y; u; Q; vi to denote the path concatenating P with Q. 
 
Lemma 8 Let x and y be two distinct vertices in Sn for n _ 3 
with x1 = y1. Then d(x; y) _ 3. 
Proof. By de_nition, d(x; y) 6= 1. Suppose that d(x; y) = 2. 
Then there is a vertex z = z1z2 _ _ _ zn�1zn adjacent to x 
and y. So we have x = ziz2 _ _ _ zi�1z1zi+1 _ _ _ zn and 
y = zjz2 _ _ _ zj�1z1zj+1 _ _ _ zn for some 2 _ i; j _ n. 
Since x 6= y, i 6= j and thus, x1 = zi 6= zj = y1 which 
contradicts the given condition. So d(x; y) _ 3. 2 
The following result directly follows from the above 
lemma. 
 
Lemma 9 Let x1; x2; _ _ _ xn�2 be distinct vertices in V 
(Si n�1) for n _ 3 with x1 1 = x2 1 = _ _ _ = xn�21 . And 
let uj be a neighbor of xj for 1 _ j _ n � 2. Then the 2(n � 
2) vertices are distinct. 
Proof. By Lemma 8, d(xi1 ; xi2) _ 3 for any 1 _ i1 6= i2 _ 
n�2. Suppose that ur is xt for some 1 _ r 6= t _ n � 2. 
Then d(xr; xt) = 1 which contradicts to Lemma 8. Suppose 
11 that ur is ut for some 1 _ r 6= t _ n�2. Then d(xr; xt) = 2. 
We also get a contradiction. Thus, the lemma follows. 2 
 
By this result, we may construct (n�2) disjoint paths to link 
the assigned number of (n�1)-dimensional subgraphs in Sn 
with all endpoints of the paths in the same subgraphs. First, 
we propose an algorithm to construct the (n � 2) paths and 
then show that the constructed paths are disjoint. 
 
Algorithm 1 
Input: m; n, where n _ 4 and 3 _ m _ n. 
Output: (n � 2) disjoint paths. 
1. Select (n � 2) vertices, say a1; a2; _ _ _ ; an�2, from V 
(Sm n�1) with the _rst digits equal to 1 
2. For i   1 to (n � 2) 
3. Pi haii 
4. For j   2 to m 
5. v   v1v2 _ _ _ vn�1vn be the last vertex in Pi 
6. Append vnv2 _ _ _ vn�1v1 to Pi 
7. Append vlv2 _ _ _ vlvnvl+1 _ _ _ vn�1v1 to Pi, where 
vl = j 
8. Append vnv2 _ _ _ vn�1v1 to Pi, where v is the last 
vertex in Pi 
9. Output P1; P2; _ _ _ ; Pn�2 
 
The following example illustrates the algorithm. 
 
Example 1. Let n = 6 and m = 3. Suppose that we select a1 
= 124563; a2 =125463; a3 = 142563; a4 = 145263 in line 1. 
Then in lines 2-8, we obtain: 12 
 
h124563; 324561; 234561; 134562; 314562; 214563i, 
h125463; 325461; 235461; 135462; 315462; 215463i, 
h142563; 342561; 243561; 143562; 341562; 241563i, 
h145263; 345261; 245361; 145362; 345162; 245163i. 
2 
Since there are (n�2)! vertices in Sm n�1 with the _rst 
digits equal to 1, it is not a hard work to _nd enough 
vertices in line 1. In line 3, each Pi = haii is initialized. 
Consider lines 4-7. For each turn, we append two vertices 
into the tail of Pi, and the two vertices are in Sj n�1 for 2 _ 
j _ m. After the last turn, the _rst digit of the last vertex in 
Pi is m. Thus, in line 8, the appended vertex is in Sm 
n�1. Note that the _rst digits and the last digits of the tth 
vertices in all constructed paths are of the same, 
respectively. 
 
By Lemma 9, we can check that the (n�2) paths are 
disjoint. We can also check that 
each path contains 2m vertices with two vertices in each 
subgraph, so each path crosses 
m subgraphs. Thus, we have the following result. 
Lemma 10 There are (n�2) disjoint paths of length (2m�1) 
crossing S1 
 Theorem 3 There are cycles of all even length from 6 to (n! 
� 2jFvj) in Sn � F where F = Fv [ Fe for Fv _ V (Sn) and 
Fe _ E(Sn) with jFj _ n � 3 for n _ 3.
