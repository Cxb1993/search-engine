Abstract 
In this decade, many techniques have been 
introduced to fabricate photonic crystal in optical 
applications. Most of the processes used to fabricate 
the photonic crystal are time consuming and not cost 
effective. This study demonstrates an efficient method 
to fabricate photonic crystals. A polymer-based 
photonic crystal slab has been developed by 
embedding mixture with a high dielectric constant. 
Photonic crystals have patterned structures in which 
periodicity of dielectric properties can manipulate 
electromagnetic waves. The operation wavelength is 
about half of the characteristic dimension. Technique 
of injection molding is applied to make polymer parts 
with the photonic crystal pattern. Then mixture of 
barium titanate powder and epoxy is embedded on the 
patterned structure of the polymer part. The contrast of 
dielectric coefficients between mixture and polymer 
can constitute a structure with some photonic band 
gap. By means of polymer processing, mass 
production of photonic crystal devices like optical 
switch, optical waveguide, optical filter and so forth 
can be realized in a cost effective way. 
 
Keywords: Photonic band gap, PMMA, EBL 
 
Introduction 
Photonic crystals are periodically repeating 
structures made of two materials with different 
dielectric constants1, 2. The periodic dielectric 
structures produce photonic band gap where the 
propagation of photon within in a certain range of 
wavelength is forbidden. In case of aiming to control 
the light completely without any emission lost, a 
photonic crystal structure with three-dimensional band 
gap is needed. Many photonic band gap applications 
are done by inserting some artificial defects into 
structures. However, this kind of structure is hard to 
fabricate. In recent years, two-dimensional photonic 
slabs have been demonstrated in many applications 
such as photonic crystal waveguides and photonic 
crystal light emitting diodes3-10. The technology of 
defining two-dimensional patterns is well developed 
in Integrated Circuit (IC) or Micro Electro-Mechanical 
Systems (MEMS) fabrication process. Some existing 
techniques can directly be applied to fabrication 
two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs such as 
Lithographie Galvanoformung Abformung (LIGA), 
LIGA-like or soft-lithography11, 12 processes. The 
photonic crystal slabs can control in-plane light 
propagation. Most of out-plane light is strongly 
reflected back into slabs by index-guided13. Although 
the light in the slab may leak out slightly, the in-plane 
light is still well-controlled.  
In this work, design, analysis and fabrication of 
a two-dimensional plastic photonic crystal slab 
molded by injection molding is studied. The photonic 
band gap can be obtained based on two key conditions. 
First, the dielectric constant difference of the two 
materials should be large enough14. Second, the 
characteristic size of the specific pattern is about 
quarter of the operation wavelength. The plastic 
materials typically show a low dielectric constant. In 
order to form a photonic band gap, a high dielectric 
constant material is introduced on to the plastic 
material to obtain a large dielectric constant contrast. 
Most methods of fabricating photonic crystals are by 
means of semiconductor process such as lithography, 
etch, or deposition.  The injection molding process 
can rapidly duplicates the surface structure of a 
patterned mold insert. Therefore, a desired structure 
could be defined on a mold insert first and the plastic 
material with the same surface structure cane be 
produced by the following molding. The fabrication of 
mold insert still includes some expensive and time 
 4
surface heating system. The rapid heating system 
consists of four 1000 W infrared lamps (Fig. 6) which 
locally heats up the mold insert surface in about 50 
seconds. The process parameters are mold temperature 
58 ℃ , mold surface temperature 130 ℃, melting 
temperature 260 ℃, injection speed 90 mm/s, packing 
pressure 130 MPa, switch over pressure 150 MPa, 
packing time 30 seconds, and cooling time 60 
seconds. 
  
Molding results 
The rapid heating system plays an important role 
in process of the molding. In conventional injection 
molding process, increasing the mold temperature and 
the packing pressure is the ways to facilitate the filling 
of the polymer melt into nanostructure. However, 
higher mold temperature means longer cycle time and 
warpage comes with a high packing pressure. Local 
heating of the mold insert and the cavity provides an 
efficient option for the molding process.  This local 
heating device can increase the cavity temperature 
above the glass transition point to enable the polymer 
to fill the nano structure. Thus the polymer melt can 
completely fill into the nanostructure without heating 
the entire mold.   
 The dimension of photonic crystal may deviate 
from the design during the fabrication process. EBL is 
one of the most promising candidates for defining the 
nano pattern, but the electron scattering between the 
substrate and the resist still affects the accuracy of 
dimension. Because of electron scattering, the exposed 
area on the bottom of resist is larger than that on the 
top. After lift-off, the resist is removed and the pattern 
will expand somewhat. A dry etch process slightly 
reduces the pattern’s dimension. The following step, 
injection molding process, can also affect the accuracy 
of the dimensional control.  
The final part after injection molding process is 
shown in Fig. 7. The gaps between line structures are 
smaller than that defined in the mold insert (Fig. 5) 
which means that the nanostructure of injection 
molding part expands during the process. Because of 
the dimension deviation of nano structure during the 
processes of pattern definition and injection molding, 
the final part is difficult to comply with the designed 
dimension in the entire process. Figure 8 shows the 
band gap variation with the deviation of nano structure 
dimension. For a parameter )5.0/( =λa , there will 
be still a band gap in the photonic crystal as the 
dimension deviation is as large as 9.6%. For this 
design parameter )5.0/( =λa , the tolerance of 
expansion is larger than shrinkage. Figure 9 shows the 
transmission spectrum of the photonic crystal in the 
final part simulated by the FDTD method. Light with 
wavelength about 1550 nm will still be forbidden. The 
deviation shifts the range of transmission-blocked to 
lower frequency (longer wavelength). However, a 
patterned nano structure for a plastic photonic crystal 
is produced. Some manipulation about the designed 
dimension or the mixture can be done to locate the 
band gap to the desired point. 
 
Conclusions 
 We have studied on the design, analysis and 
fabrication of plastic photonic crystals with a 
one-dimensional pattern by embedding high dielectric 
constant mixture. Electromagnetic waves should be 
blocked at wavelength of 1550 nm within this 
photonic crystal. The plastic part with nano patterns 
for photonic crystal is demonstrated to be able to 
achieve by the injection molding process. By means of 
polymer processing fabrication, photonic crystal 
devices like optical switch, optical waveguide, optical 
filter and so forth can be duplicated efficiently.
