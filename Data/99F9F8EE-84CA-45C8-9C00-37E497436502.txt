  質子交換膜燃料電池(PEMFCs)除了具有高能量密度、高轉換效率等優
點，又因其啟動時間短，故常被應用於可攜式裝置，是目前相當熱門的綠色
替代能源之一。然而在運作過程中，電池模組的質子交換膜會因電滲作用使
得陽極側缺水，造成質子交換膜無法保持濕潤，質子導電率下降，進而嚴重
影響燃料電池的性能。過去習慣在反應氣體送入燃料電池前先經由外部增濕
器將氣體增濕，但此方式除了會增加整體的重量及系統之複雜性，也增加了
應用上的難度。因此，本研究探討在不外加增濕系統的情況下，製備一具有
自增濕能力之膜電極組來解決陽極缺水之問題。 
  本研究使用 AB2型儲氫合金(AB2-type HSA)當作水分子吸附劑，添加於
陽極觸媒層中，增進陽極側的濕度並提升電池的性能。研究結果顯示，添加
AB2型儲氫合金於陽極觸媒層中，在陽極低增濕溫度(30°C)的情況下，可提升
約 32%的電池效能。此技術目前已申請專利，相信對於質子交換膜燃料電池
應用於可攜式裝置又多了一項關鍵技術。 
 
Abstract 
Transition-metal oxides had been utilized as a water adsorbent to improve the 
wettability of the anode in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for many 
years. Nevertheless, the high electrical resistance of the metal oxides limits the content 
that can be added to the electrode. In this study, the feasibility of adding an AB2-type 
hydrogen storage alloy (HSA) into the anode catalyst layer to improve the cell 
performance of PEMFCs was investigated. The wettability of the catalyst layer upon 
adding the AB2-type HSA to the anode and the internal resistance of single cell were also 
evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the wettability of the catalyst layers with 
ground AB2-type HSA addition was superior to that with as-received AB2-type HSA, 
reflected from the water contact angle of the catalyst layers that decreases as the weight 
fraction of the AB2-type HSA increases. The cell with 10% ground AB2-type HSA 
addition in the anode catalyst layer exhibits the best performance in which the anode 
humidifier temperature ranges from 30 to 70°C.

the reduction of proton conductivity and the degradation of cell performance. A 
composite catalyst layer consisting of hygroscopic particles that maintain the water 
content in the catalyst layer is beneficial to have an optimum hydration level in the MEA 
under dehydration environment. Several studies have been proposed to prepare the 
composite catalyst layer by adding hygroscopic SiO2 and Al2O3 particles into the anode 
catalyst layer to improve the wettability and performance of the MEA in dehydration 
conditions.[17-19] However, the cell performance of the abovementioned approaches is 
commonly restricted by the inherent high electrical resistance of the hygroscopic metal 
oxide particles, which is often counterbalanced by the improved wettability of the 
catalyst layer in the MEA. In principle, a hygroscopic material with a low electrical 
resistance is able to solve this dilemma. Hydrogen storage alloys (HSA) have been 
broadly used in the nickel-metal hydride battery as the negative electrode for many 
years.[20,21] According to the chemical reactions in the nickel-metal hydride battery, 
HSA could react with water to form metal hydrides in the presence of electrons. It is the 
purpose of this study to investigate the effect of adding HSA particles into the anode 
catalyst layer in the MEA of PEMFCs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4 Characterization of materials and polarization analysis 
Wideangle X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the crystallinity of HSA was performed by a MAC 
MXP III X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and operated at 40 kV, 30 mA. The 
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was determined by a Micrometrics ASAP 
2010 system. The surface morphology of the HSA was examined by a JEOL 6700 
field-emission-scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The sessile drop method using a 
Fat 200 contact angle system was used to measure the contact angle of water on the 
catalyst surface. A fuel cell test station, Beam 100 from Beam Associate Co., Ltd., was 
used to obtain the polarization curves of the single cell with a serpentine flow pattern. 
Hydrogen and oxygen served as the fuels, and the gas flow rate (100 cm3 min−1) for 
hydrogen and oxygen was kept constant during measurement. An anode humidifier was 
kept at varying temperatures such as 30, 50, and 70°C to study the effect of anode 
humidification conditions on the cell performance. The temperatures of the cell and the 
cathode humidifier were fixed at 60°C. The polarization measurement was conducted at 
ambient conditions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adsorption curve International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) 
classification, typically characterized for nonporous materials. A hysteresis loop at a high 
relative pressure (P/P0 = 0.7–1.0) can be observed in the ground AB2-type HSA. The 
BET surface area of the as-received and ground AB2-type HSA were measured to be 
2.511 and 8.122 m2 g−1, respectively. To prepare the Pt/C catalyst, the commercial carbon 
black was initially dispersed by ultrasonic treatment with sodium montmorillonite, and 
then the chloroplatinic acid and methanol were added into the mixture for the Pt 
reduction reaction. Figure 5 shows the XRD spectrum of the Pt/C catalyst. The 
diffraction peaks of Pt are observed at 2θ values of 39.7° (111), 46.2° (200), and 67.4° 
(220). The mean diameters of Pt particles of the Pt/C catalyst is 7.3 nm, estimated via the 
Debye–Scherrer equation using the fwhm of the (111) peak at 2θvalues of 39.7°. Figure 6 
shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) pictures of the Pt/C catalyst, 
indicating that the Pt nanoparticles in the Pt/C catalyst are well-dispersed on the carbon 
black. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3 Water absorption ability of anode with HSA addition 
To understand the water absorption ability of the anode in the MEA with different 
amounts of AB2-type HSA addition, an experiment was carried out to measure the water 
vapor transmission rate of the anode, as shown in Fig. 9. The diameter of the vial used in 
this experiment was 16.2 mm, and the rim was glued with water-proof adhesive to ensure 
that the transmission of water vapor was only from the anode layer. The testing apparatus 
was heated at 45°C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The water vapor transmission rate is 
calculated by the following equation 
 
Water vapor transmission rate=
Weight loss of water
Area × Time
 (g/cm2 h) 
 
Table III listed the weight loss of water in the vial in which the anode layers have 
different amounts of ground and as-received AB2-type HSA addition. Figure 10 shows 
the water vapor transmission rate of anodes with different amounts of as-received and 
ground AB2-type HSA addition, indicating that the addition of AB2-type HSA in the 
anodic catalyst layer can enhance the water absorption ability, and for the same amount 
of AB2-type HSA addition, the catalyst layer with ground AB2-type HSA is superior to 
that with as-received one. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, UGHSA10 exhibits the highest current density among the MEAs with different 
as-received AB2-type HSA addition in the anode. The excessive amount of AB2-type 
HSA (i.e., 20 and 40%) causes the lowering of cell performance. This suggests that there 
are other factors attributed to the cell performance. Because the AB2-type HSA is an 
electronic conductor, the influence on the cell electronic resistance due to the addition of 
AB2-type HSA could be eliminated. The cell performance of the AB2-type HSA added 
MEAs is mainly determined by a competition mechanism between the positive effect that 
arose from the enhancement of wettability of the anodic catalyst layer and the negative 
effect induced by the large particle size of AB2-type HSA. A better wettability of anodic 
catalyst was beneficial to reduce the ionic resistance of a single cell. However, the 
asreceived AB2-type HSA with an average diameter of 50 μm, regarded as an obstacle to 
species transport, hinders the ion migration and then increases the ionic resistance. In 
addition, it also impedes the diffusion of hydrogen and water vapor to lengthen the 
distance of gas diffusion pathway, and then deteriorates the whole reaction rate and the 
cell performance. The combination effect of the asreceived AB2-type HSA addition on 
the internal cell resistance of cell was studied. The internal cell resistance is the sum of 
ionic and electronic resistances. The empirical equations from Tu et al. [26] were adopted 
to estimate the internal resistance of the single cell from the polarization curves. The 
calculated internal resistance is plotted as a function of %HSA added in Fig. 12. From 
this figure, the internal resistances of MEAs with the addition of as-received AB2-type 
HSA are lower than that without as-received AB2-type HSA addition. This could be 
attributed to the better wettability of the catalyst layer with as-received AB2-type HSA 
addition. The MEA with 10% asreceived AB2-type HSA addition has the lowest internal 
resistance among others over the anode humidification temperatures of 30, 50, and 70°C. 
The excessive amount of as-received AB2-type HSA causes the increase in the internal 
resistance due to large particle size. Figure 13 shows the polarization curves with various 
negative effect induced by the large particle size of AB2-type HSA after the grinding 
process. Furthermore, it shows that the MEAs with 10% as-received and ground 
AB2-type HSA addition have the lowest internal resistance in both cases over the anode 
humidification temperatures of 30, 50, and 70°C. In summary, the addition of HSA in the 
anodic catalyst layer could effectively enhance the cell performance and the 
improvement of cell performance of the MEA with ground AB2-type HSA was superior 
to that with the as-received AB2-type HSA. The optimum amount of HSA addition 
(ground and as-received) was 10%.
