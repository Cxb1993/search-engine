MEASUREMENT OF YOUNG'S MODULUS AND POISSON'S RATIO OF 
THIN FILMS BY IMPROVED BULGE TEST 
利用改良式膨脹測試法量測薄膜材料之機械性質 
 
1. Introduction 
The insufficient knowledge of material properties at 
design mechanism devices is a critical problem 
especially when the structure scale is smaller than the 
bulk material which is from millimeter scale to 
micrometer scale. Furthermore, the structure scales even 
lead in nanometer scale in the past two decades. 
Thin films are commonly and widely application 
structural modules at micromechanical technology, such 
as substrate, metallization, resistor, dielectric, magnetic, 
and integrated circuits, etc. To fabricate a mechanically 
reliable thin film device, the mechanical properties of 
the materials used for the device is extremely important. 
Only with such information may forecast the reliability 
of these mechanism devices. Thus, the competence to 
describe and understand the mechanical properties of 
thin films is critical to the engineers and material 
researchers [1].  
Mechanical properties of thin films are often quite 
different from those of bulk materials. In general, the 
thinness is the directly consequence. The close 
proximity means that surface effect and interface effect 
are governing material behavior in thin films than in 
bulk materials. For example, dislocation motion in thin 
films can be constrained by elastic interaction with the 
substrate, greatly increasing yield stress [2-4]. The 
coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) will produce 
thermal residual stress in different kind of materials and 
will cause crack, deformation, and delamination. Thin 
film materials typically have much smaller grain sizes 
than bulk materials, and then structures and distributions 
of thin film grain are obviously different from bulk 
materials [5]. 
Mechanical properties tests for bulk materials have 
been included in standardized techniques, but they may 
face some of difficult to apply and measure controlled 
stress and strain in thin films. Although some of 
techniques have been developed to test mechanical 
properties of thin films which involve the micro tensile 
test, the cantilever beam bending test, the three point 
bending test, the four point bending test, the 
nanoindentation test, the bulge test, and the frequency 
resonant method. Each model of sample of those tests is 
exclusive, and the precision of shape and dimension for 
a sample will affect the experimental result deeply. In 
above available approaches, the ability to measure 
Young’s modulus is the micro tensile test, the cantilever 
beam bending test, the nanoindentation test, and the 
bulge test. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
The accurate prediction of the mechanical 
properties of nano-classified thin films is extremely 
important information to correctly design and apply 
MEMS devices. To determine the Young’s modulus of a 
thin film by adopting the typically bulge test, it must 
initially assume the Poisson’s ratio. However, if the 
assumption value of the Poisson’s ratio is quite different 
with the real value of the Poisson’s ratio for a thin film, 
it will affect the accuracy of the Young’s modulus of the 
thin film material. The typically bulge test with optical 
measurement method is to acquire the data of swelling 
displacement of the center point of a thin film, i.e., one 
point optical method. However, the typically bulge test 
will lose its accuracy if the welling film is under 
unsymmetrical. This study is to bring up an improved 
bulge test，which is to employ whole field optical 
method to modify the function of applied pressure with 
respect to bulge height, and to obtain an accurate biaxial 
modulus composed of Young’s modulus and Poisson’ s 
ratio. Therefore, the values of Young’s modulus and 
Poisson’s ratio may simultaneously solve out from 
biaxial modulus. Meantime, the residual stress of thin 
films will also be confirmed by the improved bulge test 
method.

3. Experimental results 
The typical interference pattern from photo image of a 
circular, pressurized window is shown in Figure 1. The 
circular shape of the window is clear enough to calculate 
the value of every fringe, and the symmetry of the fringe 
pattern about the center of the circular window designates 
that the experimental result is acceptance. 
The interference pattern from pressurized circular thin 
film window at 200 Pa and 400 Pa is shown in Figure 2. 
The vertical height from one interference fringe to its 
neighbor’s fringe is 0.3162 μm. The white scale bar is 
1000 μm and it means the radius, a, of the circular 
window. The silicon dioxide thin film thickness is 1 μm by 
means of thermal oxidation. 
We can obtain the relationship of bulge height versus 
radius for circular thin film window from experimental 
measurement and shows in Figure 3. 
Furthermore, the curve equation of the bulge 
height-radius of circular thin film window relationship can 
be expressed as a polynomial displacement function by 
curve fitting method, which is the same as Equation (3) 
and written as

266 1065312104078668942 r.r..w −− ×−×−=  (16)
where  is the function of bulge height deflection with 
respect to radius r. Equation (15) is bulge height deflection 
at 200 Pa of applied pressure load and Equation (16) is 
bulge height deflection at 400 Pa of applied pressure load. 
At the central of the circular window, r=0, the height is 
equal the bulge height which defined in typical bulge test.

We substitute Equation (15) and Equation (4) to 
Equation (6) into Equation (10), the analytical 
load-deflection relationship is represented as

where  is the applied uniform pressure load on circular 
thin film window, 
p
0σ  is the residual stress of thin film, 
and M  is the biaxial modulus of the circular thin films 
window in this study.  
Therefore, we can solve 0σ  and M  of silicon dioxide 
circular thin film window from Equation (17) and (18).
