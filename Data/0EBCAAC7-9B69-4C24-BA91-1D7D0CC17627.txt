Abstract— To improve spectrum efficiency (SE), the adaptive 
modulation and coding (AMC) and automatic repeat request 
(ARQ) scheme have been combined for OFDM systems. In this 
paper, we add variable power subject to power constraint in 
each AMC mode. We use KKT optimization algorithm to get 
the optimal transmit power and AMC mode boundaries. The 
numerical results show that the average SE is increased by 
about 0.3 bits/sec/Hz for OFDM systems with Nakagami 
fading with parameter m=2 when SNR is around 15dB and the 
retransmission is once.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The demand for high data rate and quality of service 
(QoS) in wireless networks requires cross layer approach 
[1]. In [2], the authors proposed combining constant-power 
AMC scheme in physical layer and truncated automatic 
repeat request (ARQ) protocol in single-carrier systems. For 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) 
systems, similar scheme can be found in [3]. All above are 
the constant-power AMC schemes. 
An adaptive-power AMC method to increase average 
SE for single-carrier systems subject to power constraint 
averaged over all AMC modes is proposed in [4].  In this 
paper, we propose adaptive-power AMC method to increase 
average SE for OFDM systems subject to power constraint 
in each AMC modes. In other words, there is one 
Lagrangian multiplier in [4], but multiple Lagrangian 
multipliers in this paper. In addition, [4] deal with 
single-carrier systems but we deal with OFDM systems. 
 
 
 
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
    The system model of the proposed adaptive power 
AMC and ARQ OFDM system is shown in Fig. 1. 
Consider of power adaptation, we modify the packet 
error rate (PER) expression in the AMC mode n, 
Nn ,...,1=∀ , as follows [2]˖

The mode dependent parameters },,{ pnnn ga γ  are 
given in [2](Table II). S  denotes the average transmit 
power. )(γnS  is the adaptive power inside the AMC mode 
n and γ  is the switching SNR to the AMC mode n. So we 
need to solve adaptive power under each mode first, then 
we can look for the mode-switching SNR values. 
 
III. ADAPTIVE –POWER AMC 
  Because the AMC algorithm is the same for all 
OFDM sub-carrier, so we only discuss the AMC scheme 
with truncated ARQ protocol in the i-th sub-carrier in this 
section. 
  Here, we propose adaptive-power AMC to find the 
optimal SNR switching level that maximize SE under the 
PER constraint. The instantaneous PER is smaller than

power factor to make the average SE larger. From (1), we 
can find the power adaptation with PER constraint in mode

IV. Results 
We present numerical results for average SE using the optimal 
solution. We use a Nakagami fading with parameter m=2 channel 
model, and assume a target PER = 0.01. Fig. 2 depicts the average 
SE for the AMC scheme in [2](TABLE II), We observe that the 
SE of the proposed scheme with ARQN  = 1 is larger than that of 
ARQN =2 in [2] (constant_arq=2 curve) about 0.3 bits/sec/H. And 
in Fig. 2, we can see the proposed scheme with ARQN =2 
and ARQN =1 have the same SE. The proposed scheme with 
ARQN =3 is not shown because it is worse than those with 
ARQN =2 and ARQN =1. Because increasing ARQN , we alleviate 
the error bound to improve the average SE, but retransmission the 
same packet too many times will also degrade the average SE.

in (1). If considering adaptation power, we have two 
unknown elements, )(γnS  is the adaptive power inside the 
mode n and γ  is the switching SNR to mode n. So we 
need to solve adaptive power under each mode first, then we 
can look for the mode-switching SNR values.  
   
III. ADAPTIVE –POWER AMC  
 
  Because the AMC algorithm is the same for all SISO

optimal SNR switching level that maximize SE under the

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTES 
 
  Here, we present numerical results for average spectral 
efficiency, power adaptation and PER using the optimal 
solution. We find the constraint in (5) when Nakagami 
channel m=1 is a special case that )(xEi  in (4) has no 
close-form and can’t give the value of constraint in (5). So 
we use Nakagami channel fading parameter with m=2 
instead. We use the parameters of AMC scheme that is 
listed in Table I from [5].In Fig. 4, we can see power 
switching in each mode and the leftmost power in each 
AMC mode is largest that make the average PER to conform 
PER constraint in each AMC mode. Fig. 2 shows the 
flowchart of optimal search algorithm. We use a Nakagami 
fading with parameter m=2 (2,2) MIMO channel model, and 
assume a target PLR of lossP =0.01.Fig. 3, depict the 
average spectral efficiency for TM2 AMC scheme in Table I,
