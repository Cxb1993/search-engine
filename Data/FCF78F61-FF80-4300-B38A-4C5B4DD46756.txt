meshless method is more attractive since the 
model set-up takes a lesser time for 
dimension reduction. Some important 
meshless methods have also been reported 
in the literature [3, 4, 7-11]. The MFS has 
been extensively applied to solve some 
engineering problems [7-10].  Since only 
boundary nodes are distributed, it is a kind 
of meshless method. 
This paper present an alternative 
approach for the numerical treatment of the 
the eigensolutions for membranes with 
stringers, keeping the meshless feature of 
the MFS and choosing the normal derivative 
of fundamental solution of the Helmholtz 
equation as the RBF. By using the 
desingularization of subtracting and 
adding-back technique, the singularity and 
hypersingularity of the kernel functions can 
be regularized. The main idea is to augment 
one series with the singular term to subtract 
the same singular term of the series of the 
solution representation. The two singular 
terms are equal and the sum of augmented 
series is zero. The diagonal terms of the 
influence matrices can be derived by using 
the proposed technique.  
Over twenty years, the main applications 
were limited in BVPs without degenerate 
boundaries. Since the degenerate boundary 
results in rank deficiency for the Meshless 
method and BEM, the multi-domain BEM 
[6] was utilized to solve the nonunique 
solution by introducing an artificial 
boundary. The drawback of the 
multi-domain approach is obvious in that 
the artificial boundary is arbitrary, and thus 
not qualified as an automatic scheme. In 
addition, a larger system of equations is 
required since the degrees of freedoms on 
the interface are put into the system. For 
half plane or infinite problem, the artificial 
boundary is not finite. The three 
shortcomings encourage us to deal with the 
degenerate boundary problem by using the 
single domain concept with SVD technique 
Up to the present, no literature has been 
published in international journal by using 
the meshless method without the 
multi-domain approach to the authors' best 
knowledge. We may wonder is it possible to 
find the eigensolution in a single domain 
with a degenerate boundary approach. 
Therefore, we deal with the degenerate 
problem using the novel meshless method in 
conjunction with the SVD technique in this 
report. We solve the membrane 
eigenproblems with stringers using the 
novel meshless method+SVD. By 
employing only the novel meshless method, 
the eigenvalue is detected in a single 
domain by finding the successive zero 
singular values using the rank revealing 
technique of SVD. The case with inclined 
stringer is solved.

2-3 Treatment of degenerate boundary 
problems 
(1). Multi-domain technique 
According to the concept of multi-domain 
technique, it separates the domain into D+  
and D− , which can be seen in Fig.1, and 
the labels of subdomains D+  and D− are 
given a and b as subscripts, respectively. 
Thus the problems need two more 
constraints on the interface between two 
subdomains. The additional two constraints 
of the continuity and equilibrium conditions 
on the interface are * *a bφ φ= and * *a bψ ψ= − , 
where the supscript * denote the interface. 
After that, this concept combining with the 
above mentioned meshless method can deal 
with this problem, and it can be 
implemented as

SVD with respect to the near zero or zero 
singular value by using 
[ ]{ } { } ,   1, 2, , .i i iK i Pψ σ φ= = L  (24)
If the qth singular value, qσ , is zero, in 
Eq.(24) we have 
[ ]{ } { }0 0,   .q qK q Pψ φ= = ≤  (25)
According to Eq.(25), the nontrivial 
boundary mode is found to be the right 
singular vector, { }qψ , in the right unitary 
matrix. Therefore, the step to determine 
nontrivial boundary mode in the 
multi-domain technique is avoided by 
setting a reference value. Here, Novel 
meshless method+SVD employed the 
influence IA⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦  or IB⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦  for [ ]K  in 
Eq.(17) for Dirichlet eigenproblem and 
Eq.(18) for Neumann eigenproblem.  
 
3. A benchmark test  
We next the problem illustrated in Fig.3(a). 
A square membrane is given with a length a. 
For simplicity, we set l=1 m. In this report, 
the novel meshless method in conjunction 
with SVD is employed. In order to check 
the validity, the results of our proposed 
meshless method + SVD are compared with 
DBEM The distribution of source point for 
the case is shown in Fig.3(b). Using the 
proposed method in conjunction with SVD, 
the ( 1dNσ +  )th zero singular value obtained 
by using Eq.(25) for IA⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦  matrix, ([K]= 
[ ] IK A⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦ ) is plotted versus the wave 
number in Fig.4(a). The curve drops at the 
eigenvalues. Direct searching scheme to 
extract out true and spurious eigenvalues 
resulted from degenerate boundary and 
nontrivial solution is employed in the 
present paper. For the generalized algebraic 
eigenproblem, some effective schemes have 
been proposed, e.g. William-Wellie 
algorithm [5]. Since this is not our main 
focus, the efficient algorithm is not 
discussed here. By using the dual BEM, the 
determinants versus the wave number are 
also shown in Fig.4(b) Good agreements for 
the former eigenvalues are made. For this 
case, the number of boundary nodes, dN , on 
the degenerate boundary is 10. Since the 
( 1)thdN +  zero singular value, ( 1dNσ + )th, 
originates from the nontrivial boundary 
mode, Fig.5(a) shows the 1dNψ +  along the 
boundary for the solved unknown densities 
corresponding to the former four 
eigenvalues. For the former four 
eigenvalues, the first right singular 
vector 1ψ  corresponding to the first zero 
singular value ( 1 0σ = ) along the boundary 
in Fig.5(b), also indicate that the 1ψ  is 
trivial except on the degenerate boundary. 
Since the former dN  zero singular values 
( 1 1 0dNσ σ σ= = =L ) originate from the 
degenerate boundary, the corresponding 
right singular vectors ( 1 ~ dNψ ψ ) are found
