Abstract 
The main purpose of this paper is to develop a practical operation model for water 
conservation, in particular, to propose a solution for an urban drought period. According 
to a initial investigation, a huge capacity raft foundation space approximately 10 millions 
cubic meters was found in the existing urban buildings in Taipei city. The capacity of 
these idle raft foundations is almost equal to a mid-scale reservoir. In this research, an 
urban drought prevention model with allocation to prevent-drought (APD) utilizing raft 
foundations of existing buildings and the reservoir, implemented by Linear Programming, 
is developed to provide sufficient water for residential water utilization during a period of 
urban drought. According to the results of this research, the proposed model has been 
proven to be a practicable and feasible urban drought prevention solution.

1. Introduction 
Taiwan is located in the Asian monsoon area and has an abundant supply of rainwater with 
annual precipitation that averages around 2 500 mm. However, water shortages are still a critical 
problem during the dry season. Water conservation is an inherent pre-requisite for sustainable utility 
service provision in building design today. Growing pressures from fresh water shortages and 
pollution are becoming one of the most critical global problems.  
Many metropolitan areas in Taiwan have experienced water shortages in recent years, due partly 
to droughts, economic development and rapid urbanization. These water shortages have resulted in an 
anxious public consciousness of in adequate existing water supplies and created an economic barrier to 
development. It has caused great damage in metropolitan areas. Consequently, it is clear that a 
practicable solution must be conducted to alleviate the water shortage problem in urban areas. 
Recently, a general investigation of raft foundation space in existing urban buildings was executed. 
According to the initial results of this fundamental survey in Taipei city, a huge capacity raft 
foundation space, approximately 10 million cubic meters, was found in existing urban buildings in 
Taipei. The capacity of these idle raft foundations is almost equal to a mid-scale reservoir.  
This paper introduces a simplified model for preventing urban drought by allocation to 
prevent-drought (APD) using the raft foundations of an existing building and the reservoir 
implemented by Linear Programming. This model is developed to provide sufficient water for 
residential water utilization during a period of urban drought. Meanwhile, a twelve story residential 
building in Taipei was chosen as a study case to be implemented by Linear Programming.  Eventually, 
based on the results of the optimization, solutions are made which verify that the target building can be 
sure of enough water to flush toilets in the building during a period of drought. The importance of 
utility performance will be stressed and a method that allows reliable verification for general building 
categories will be presented 
. 
2. Literature Review and relevant issues 
2.1 Literature Review 
In the field of utilization of rainwater collected from roofs, the authors A Fewkes, A.Dixon, and 
D. Butler [1]. [2]. [3]. [4] etc, have made use of the analytic models to study the efficiency of the 
usage of rainfall collected from roofs and the size of storage needed to preserve the rainfall collected 
in the area of England during 1996 through 2000.  “Rainwater Use System in Building Design---A 
Case Study of Calculation and Efficiency Assessment System” by Cheng, C. L. [5] , also studied how 
to evaluate the efficiency of utilization of rainwater in the year of 2004.   According to historical 
research information, Ripple (1883) obtained the design reservation capacity of a reservoir based on 
mass diagram analysis and he initialized the concept of simulation models.     
There are two basic simulation models: (1) Simulation; The model utilizes mathematical 
methods to describe the characteristics of a system and the method of trial and error for comparison 
and analysis to obtain a better solution to the problem considered.  The solutions have been used to

The Feitsui Reservoir lies on the Northeastern side of Taipei as shown in Fig. (3). Its water 
holding capacity is about 300 million cubic meters. The full water level elevation of the Reservoir is 
170 meters and the empty water level is 110 meters.  The main purpose of the Feitsui Reservoir is to 
supply the water for public use in the area of Taipei and the generation of electricity is a subsidiary 
function. In accordance with the Feitsui Reservoir operation and utilization rule, the reservoir 
operation rule curves (denoted as “ORC”) can be classified as ORC.1, ORC.2, ORC.3 and ORC.4 etc. 
as indicated in Fig.(4).   However, in accordance with the rules, when the water level of Feitsui 
Reservoir is above ORC.2, the amount of reservation water should be sufficient to meet the water 
requirements of the plan (namely to supply water and generate electricity).  When the water level is 
below ORC.2, no generating of electricity is allowed.  If the water level drops below 
ORC.3,limitation of use of water must be executed. ORC.4 is a warning line for the drought situation 
of reservoir.

3.2 Concept of APD  
In order to prevent drought by allocating water between raft foundations of buildings and the 
reservoir, during the period of non-drought (denoted as “POND”), the extra amount of water from the 
reservoir and the water collected from roofs of buildings can be reserved in raft foundations. Hence, it 
can be used to alleviate the drought when the period of drought (denoted as “POD”) happens as the 
conception diagram shown in Fig. (5). 
 
 
Fig ( 5 ). Concept of allocation prevent-drought model (APD) 
 
Generally, the guideline for distinguishing”POND” from “POD” is based on the operational rule 
lines of the reservoir. The operational rule lines in the water management of the reservoir are a set of 
curves containing the relationship of the numerical values of water level of the reservoir with ten-days 
and 36 ten-days constitute a year. Fig. (6) illustrates the decision variables and APD model concept. 
3.3 The scope of decision variables during POND/POD 
The decision variable of tap water supplied from the reservoir to flush toilets (pwt) during 
POND is higher than the normal tap water supply criterion in order for the water to be stored in raft 
foundation ready to prevent drought.  On the other hand, the decisional variables of tap water 
supplied from the reservoir to flush toilets during POD are lower than the normal tap water supply. 
The consume water of buildings flush toilets (twt) is same as original during POND but it needs 
to use sparingly during POD.  The amount of water collected from roof (rwt) is known as constant 
and it does not need to be identified as during POND or POD. Furthermore, the decision variable for 
water stored (swt) in raft foundation is “fill as full as possible before the POD come”.  During POD, 
the water reserved in the raft foundation is used to flush toilets, then the upper bound of the decision 
variable is defined as the effective volume capacity of the raft foundation and the lower bound of the 
decision variable is defined as the amount of water spared for emergency use by the building (such as 
earthquake, fire etc). Another variable concerning the water stored (swt) in the raft foundation is how 
foundation (raft foundation, pile foundation) as shown in Fig. (7). Generally in the area of Taipei, 
shallow foundations are used for buildings with five stories and under, and deep foundations are used 
for more than five stories.  The configuration of a raft foundation consists of four foundation girders 
with top basement slab and bottom foundation slab. There always is an empty space between the 
foundation girders and slabs used for the equipment and facilities of the building, such as lifting 
equipment pits, sewage disposal equipment, etc., which are often set up in the raft foundation.  
 
 
Fig ( 7 ). Classification of building foundations 
This study collected data from building licensees issued by the Government of Taipei during 
1981- 2004: a total 17 958, including the Taipei 101 building as shown in Fig. (8). The sample analysis, 
based upon the different number of stories, shows most buildings are 3 stories to 14 stories.  The 
number of buildings of 5 stories is 7 225, the buildings of 7 stories are 3 094 and the buildings of 6 
stories are 1 434. There are 11 753 buildings altogether.  These account for 65% out of the total data 
considered. By the classification of the use of buildings, there are 3 796 commercial buildings (21.7%), 
12 051 residential buildings (68.7%), 481 industrial buildings (2.7%), 529 public buildings, (3.0%) 
and 675 other purpose buildings (3.9%). Based on the different number of stories and the use of 
buildings and its percentages out of the total data, the survey samples 128 buildings data altogether 
used in the research. The sample surveys show that buildings above 8 stories all are set up with raft 
foundations as shown in figure (9).

4. Operation and Verification  
4.1 Object building 
In order to prove the APD model is practicable, this research used a case-study to verify the 
process of proposed operation. The study object, which is located in Taipei city, was chosen to be 
considered as a simulation. Meanwhile, the relevant information about the researched building, such as 
the precipitation in the Taipei area, variations of water level and operational rules of the Feitsui 
Reservoir in historically, and the amounts of water used to flush toilets and collected from roofs are 
stated in this section. The object building of this research is a 12 story building with 2 story basement 
and a total of 82 apartment units, as shown in Fig. (3). The object building is about 18 kilometers from 
the Feitsui Reservoir. The outline of the study building is given in Table 1 as follows.  
 
Table 1. The outline of the research object building 
Basement:1, 2 floor  Each 893 (m2) 
12 stories  Each 721 (m2) 
Area of roof  721 (m2) 
Residents 329 (persons) 
Maximum capacity of raft foundation 1200 (m3) 
 
According to an initial survey, the averaged amount of water used to flush toilets of each ten-day 
for every year is 196.6 m3/ ten-day for the researched building. The averaged amount of water used to 
flush toilets reaches the highest value about 211.96 M3 in the 25th ten-day and the lowest one about 
183.15 m3 in the 10th ten-day.  Furthermore, the averaged amount of water collected from roof of 
each ten-day for every year is about 42.43 m3/ten-day for the researched building and it reaches the 
highest value about 92.18 m3 in the 24th ten-day. Therefore, the averaged amount of water collected 
from the roof for each ten-day equal 21.1% of the averaged amount of water used to flush toilets for 
each ten-day. as shown in Fig. (12) and given in table 2. 
Therefore, the simulated water supply WLOM combines ORC2 and ORC3 of the Reservoir as shown 
in Fig. (13).  
 
 
Fig ( 13 ). Illustration of the water supply warning-line in model (WLOM) 
 
The time of the bottom of WLOM, which is from the 10th ten-day to the 29th ten-day, will be set 
as the period of drought (POD). Other periods, which are from the 1st ten-day to the 9th ten-day and 
the 30th ten-day to the 36th ten-day, will be defined as the period of non-drought (POND).  
The formula for coefficient of supply water is as given in Fig. (14).The numerator of the formula 
is defined as the value of the t-th ten-day water level and subtracts the value of the t-th ten-day from 
the reservoir ORC.4 water level. The denominator is defined as the value of the t-th ten-day WLOM 
water level minus the value of the t-th ten-day reservoir ORC.4 water level.

4.3 Formula of Water-Balance  
It is the formula for water-balance of the building raft foundation in the t-th ten-day, namely, the 
summation of supplied quantity of t-th ten-day tap water (pwt), the quantity of the t-th ten-day 
rainwater (rwt ) being collected form the roof and the quantity of the preceding t-th ten-day stored 
water (swt-1) in the raft foundation equal to that of the quantity demanded for the t-th ten-day toilet 
water (twt), the quantity of the t-th ten-day overflowing water (owt) from raft foundation and the

4.4 LP Formula of APD Model 
Depending on the discussions mentioned above, the standard formula of the APD model of linear 
programming could be set up as follows. The objective function and the constraints of the linear 
programming will be stated in the following.

To obtain the optimal values of allocation between water in the reservoir and in the raft 
foundation, the objective function shall be well defined.  If the difference between the total of the tap 
water supply from the reservoir during POND (∑pwt(n)) and that of the reservoir during POD 
(∑pwt(d)) is the largest, it means that the effect of allocation is the best as shown in Fig. (17).  At 
this moment, because the difference is the maximum and the total quantity of the tap water supply of 
the reservoir in POD is the minimum, it means the effect of drought prevention is the best. 
 
 
Fig ( 19 ). Optimization result of the APD model in 1999,2002,2003 
 
Especially, in 2002, the drought of the reservoir took place relatively early.  So it resulted in an 
early start to drought resistance measures.  Fortunately, a torrential typhoon rain made the water level 
of the reservoir go up rapidly and the raft foundation also was furnished with water immediately, and 
the drought resistance continued operating until the end of POD.   The water level of the reservoir 
was always above WLOM even though there was a torrential rain during the POD in 1999. 
    Finally, the results of this research through mathematical calculation yield the average value 
of raft foundation storage swt obtained and plotted in Fig. (20). These plots show the operation trend 
during POD. The quantity of swt is filled completely starting from the 9th ten-day to the 12th ten-day 
continuously and it begins to operate.  The quantity of swt decreases relatively slowly from the 12th 
ten-day to the 19th ten-day, It drops by a large amount after the 19th ten-day and it comes to the end of 
POD until the 29th ten-day.  It begins to hold water continuously at the 29th ten-day.
