The transformation between Eulerian and Lagrangian solutions in nonlinear 
short-crested waves 
 
Abstract: A new second-order asymptotic solution that describes the short-crested waves is derived in the 
Lagrangian coordinates. The analytical Lagrangian solution that is uniformly valid for large times satisfies the 
irrotational condition and zero pressure at the free surface in contrast with the Eulerian solution existing the 
residual pressure at the free surface. The explicit parametric solution highlights the trajectory of a water 
particle and the wave kinematics above the mean water level. The mass transport velocity and Lagrangian 
mean level associated with particle displacement can also be obtained directly. In particular, the mean level of 
the particle motion in a Lagrangian form differs that of an Eulerian. The new formulation reduces to 
second-order standing or progressive waves solutions in Lagrangian coordinates at the limiting angles of 
approach. Expressions for kinematic quantities are also presented. 
Key words: Lagrangian, particle trajectory, mass transport, short-crested waves 
1. Introduction 
The study of three-dimensional short-crested waves is important to the understanding of wave-seabed 
interaction, directional irregular ocean surface, sediment transport and remote sensing in the open ocean. 
Short-crested waves, which are symmetric doubly periodic waves, common arise from the interaction of two 
oblique traveling waves with the same wave amplitude and wavenumber as well as from the reflection of 
oblique waves off a vertical seawall. This phenomenon has recently received more attention on theoretical, 
numerical and experimental research due to its complex wave-particle motions. A number of short-crested 
gravity Stokes wave solutions in the Eulerian coordinates have been presented by Hsu et al.[10], Fenton[8], 
Roberts[22], Marchant &Roberts [15], Bridges et al.[1] and so on. It is known that the Eulerian description at 
the free surface that is a part of the solution is always expressed by a Taylor series at a fixed water level, 
which implicitly assumes that the surface profile is a differentiable single-valued function. 
Unlike the Eulerian surfaces, which are given as an implicit function, the Lagrangian form is described 
through the parametric representation of particle motion. The use of Lagrangian coordinates yields the only 
known nontrivial exact solutions to the governing equations for gravity water waves (i.e., Gerstner’s solution 
for deep-water waves [9] and a recently found edge wave solution along a sloping beach [4]). The main 
advantage of such description is to allow better flexibility for describing the actual shape of the ocean surface, 
which will be demonstrated later in this paper. Based on this reason, it has been shown that the Lagrangian 
description is more appropriate for the motion of the steep free surface that cannot be captured by the classical 
Eulerian solutions [2,3,5,18]. However, reports on this notable improvement using Lagrangian description for 
three-dimensional nonlinear water waves were rather limited. 
The first water wave theory in Lagrangian coordinates was obtained by Gerstner where the flow 
possesses finite vorticity [9]. Miche [17] proposed perturbation Lagrangian solutions to the second order for a 
gravity wave. Pierson [21] applied perturbation expansions to water wave problems with Lagrangian formulae 
and obtained the first-order Lagrangian solution. Sanderson [23] obtained second-order solutions for small 
amplitude internal waves in a Lagrangian coordinate system. Constantin [4] considered first-order Lagrangian 
solutions for edge waves on a sloping beach. Buldakov et al. [2] developed a Lagrangian asymptotic 
formulation up to the fifth order for nonlinear water waves in deep water, but it yielded a non-zero vorticity 
distribution at higher order and can not be extended to a generalization of the results in three dimensions. The 
above-mentioned theories are highly rotational. 
 Recently, Longuet-Higgins [13] presented a simple physical model to obtain the Lagrangian 
characteristics of surface waves, in which the Lagrangian equations are not solved, but the particle trajectory 
is calculated from the Eulerian equations. Clamond [3] considered third-order Lagrangian solution for a 
regular progressive wave in water of finite depth. Chen et al. [6] derived the fifth-order Lagrangian solutions 
which satisfy the irrotational condition by incorporating the perturbation on the water particle frequency in 
relation to the vertical position. It is noted that Chen’s solutions [6], which are irrotational, are perfectly 
constructed by the governing equations in the Lagrangian coordinates and could be easily extended to three

where the subscripts a,b,c,t denote partial differentiation with respect to the specified variable, ( , , , )p a b c t  is 
the water pressure, ( , , , )a b c tφ  the velocity potential function in the Lagrangian system. Except for (3)~(6), 
the fundamental physical relationships defining the above equations have been derived by many authors 
[12,16,26]. Eqs. (1) is the continuity equations which are established at c=0 of the vertical label marked for the 
particles at the free surface that set the invariant condition on the volume of a Lagrangian particle; Eq.(2) is the 
differentiation of (1) with respect to time. Eqs. (3)~(6) denote the irrotational flow condition and the corresponding 
Lagrangian velocity potential, respectively. Eq. (7) is the Bernoulli equation for the irrotational flow in the 
Lagrangian description along with (3)~(6). Eq. (8) describes the dynamic boundary condition of zero pressure at 
the free surface. Eq.(9) is the bottom boundary condition of zero vertical velocity.  
3. Asymptotic Solutions 
In order to solve for the current unknown ( , , ,x y z φ  and p ) the short-crested wave must be specified. As 
shown in figure 1, let L be the wavelength of the incident and reflected waves and xL and yL the distance 
between crests in the x and y directions. Then the components of the wavenumber k may be defined 
respectively as  
2 / sin , 2 / cos ,x yL k mk L k nkπ θ π θ= = = =  (10) 
where θ  is defined as in figure 1; thus 
2 2 1.m n+ =  (11) 
When θ  become zero, a normal standing wave occurs; when it is / 2π , a progressive wave equal to the 
incident results. 
To solve the nonlinear equations (1)~(9), we introduce the Lagrangian wave frequency σ  which is a 
function of a nonlinear parameter and the Lagrangian vertical label to avoid a secular term and use the 
Lindstedt-Poincare technique that yields uniform expansions to uncover the solutions in the Lagrangian 
system. In the Lagrangian approach, the particle displacements x, y and z, the potential function φ  and 
pressure p  are considered as functions of independent variables a,b,c and time t. Following Pierson [21] and 
Piedra-Cueva [20], these solutions are sought in perturbation series in the small parameterε . This ordering 
parameter ε  is inserted to identify the order of the associated term.

2 LTσ π=  is the angular frequency of particle motion or the Lagrangian angular frequency for a particle 
reappearing at the same elavation. LT  is the period of particle motion. Upon substituting (12)~(17) in (1)~(9), 
and collecting terms of equal ε  order, we obtain a sequence of nonhomogeneous governing equations that 
can be solved successively, as shown in the following sections. 
3.1 First-order approximation 
Collecting terms of orderε , the governing equations can be obtained as

frequency ( 0σ ) is the same as that of the first-order Stokes wave frequency in the Eulerian approach. Eqs. 
(19a~i) yields the appropriate limiting cases in Lagrangian coordinates of a progressive wave as 0n →  and 
a standing wave as 0m →  [6,7].

Finally, the second-order Lagrangian solutions can be combined as

non-constant term which is independent of time but dependent upon distance from the wall in the y direction. 
These are similar to the finding of Hsu et al. [11]. The solution for the vertical trajectory 2z  includes a 
second harmonic component, a non-constant term which is independent of time but dependent upon distance 
from the wall in the y direction and a term that is a function of vertical label c and independent of x and y 
coordinates and time. This second-order vertical shift decays with water depth. Taking the average particle 
elevation 2z  over a given period of particle motion, the present theory gives the Lagrangian mean level Lη

Eq. (44) confirms that the Lagrangian mean level of short-crested waves is different with the Eulerian mean 
level, which pioneer pointed out by Longuer-Higgins [13] for two-dimensional progressive waves. 
Longuer-Higgins [13] and Ng [19] used the Euler-Lagrange transformation for two-dimensional progressive 
wave and standing wave, which are applicable only to the particles at the free surface, the present theory is 
perfectly constructed in the Lagrangian framework and is applicable for all particles over the whole range of 
levels. Hsu et al. [11] also obtained the particle motion in short-crested wave by the second-order 
transformation in terms of the Eulerian solution. However, the final expression they derived cannot satisfy the 
continuity equation (Eq.(1)) in Lagrangian coordinates and the Lagrangian mean level term does not appear in 
their solutions. The limiting forms in Lagrangian coordinates of progressive waves for m=1 and n=0 and 
standing waves for m=0 and n=1 can be readily obtained and are the same with those derived by Chen et al 
[6,7]. 
4. Results, Analysis and Discussion 
4.1 Mass transport velocity 
The existence of a steady drift associated with the propagation of a sea wave was first point out by 
Stokes[25], who treated the problem by using the classical potential wave theory in the Eulerian system. Hsu 
et al. [11] presents a second order mass transport velocity in terms of known Eulerian functions for 
short-crested waves. In the Lagrangian approach, non-periodic solutions in the even order that correlate to the 
drift velocity can be obtained directly and it is unnecessary to use the highly nonlinear Euler-Lagrange 
transformation analogous to those obtained by Hsu et al. [11]. 
Taking the time-averaged over one Lagrangian wave period of the horizontal particle displacement, the 
so-called drift velocity over the whole range of depths can be obtained as following

where the overbar denotes time-averaged over a Lagrangian wave period. Eq.(45), a second-order correction 
quantity, is the same as that obtained by Hsu et al. [11] using the Eulerian form and can be reduced readily to 
the horizontal mass transport for a progressive wave as derived by Longuet-Higgins [14]. From (45), the mass 
transport velocity is functions of the wave steepness, the water depth and the horizontal b and vertical 
Lagrangian label c. Eq.(45) shows that the second-order mass transport velocity varies spatially in two 
directions and has a positive value along x-axis for all particles from surface to bottom. This indicates that the 
second-order mass transport velocity is a nondecreasing function of vertical distance from the bottom and has 
a zero gradient at the bottom.
