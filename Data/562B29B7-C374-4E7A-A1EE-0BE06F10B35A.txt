Keywords: Debris flow, shock, shock-capturing scheme, free moving boundary.
For the prevention or reduction of the effects of debris flow disasters, the prediction of the
paths of the flows, maximum run-out distances as well as the protection for the endangered zone
is of considerable interest. Besides the derivation of theory (mathematical model) and
susceptibility analysis of debris flow torrents, a robust numerical scheme cannot be neglected.
In this report, we will investigate the shock phenomenon in debris flows/granular flows and
apply the knowledge of shock-capturing numerical scheme to describe the shock formation as
observed by experiments in laboratory. On the other side, the real debris flows are often guided
by rather curved and twisted valleys or more general slopes, which result in severe tasks for
mathematical modeling as well as numerical simulation. In this study, we generalized the
governing equations, based on Pudasaini & Hutter (2003), into an orthogonal general (curved and
twisted) coordinate system and implement the Lagrange-moving-grid scheme onto this system, to
make it possible to describe the flow over a general real basal topography.
In this report the implementation of NOC shock-capturing scheme will be introduced as
well as the simulated shock formation of rapid granular flows. In addition, a test simulation of a
finite mass down a curved and twisted channel by Lagrangian-moving-grid method will be also
demonstrated.
2flowing on surfaces that are much less inclined than the angle of response of the material and
travel distances are correspondingly large. In the fluid phase, jumps of velocity and depth (like
shocks in gas-dynamics) can be observed in experiments when the flow with sufficient speed
(super critical) is encountering obstructs (e.g. Tai et al. [1999], Tai et al. [2001c], Gray et al.
[2003]).
The model system applied in this study is the one-phase extended Savage-Hutter (SH)
theory (Savage and Hutter [1989, 1991], Hutter et al. [1993], Gray et al. [1999]) and the
Pudasaini et al. [2003] theory, which extends the SH theory to an arbitrarily but gently curved
and twisted coordinate system, and makes it possible to have insight into the effects of
non-uniform curvature and torsion, because the real flows are often guided by rather curved and
twisted valleys or more general slopes. In addition to this one-phase grain flow model, Iverson
and [1997] Iverson and Denlinger [2001] generalized the SH theory into a depth-integrated
one/two- dimensional grain-fluid mixture model, describing the motion of a finite mass of
variably fluidized grain-fluid mixture from initiation to deposition. In this mixture theory, the
influence of the inter-granular pore fluid pressure was considered as well as the influence of
solid-fluid fractions dynamically. Since pore fluid pressure plays a key role for slope failure or
sediment consolidation, this mixture theory provides a unified framework for analyzing
grain-fluid flows with differing compositions and behaviors, from flow initiation to deposit
consolidation.
Although the SH theory is a model of one-component, it has certain similarities with the
shallow water equations of hydrodynamics and thus admits discontinuous solutions. For example,
shock waves have been considered not only theoretically, but also by experiments and numerical
simulation (Gray et al. [1999], Tai [2000], Tai et al. [2001, 2002], Gray et al. [2003]). In this
study, the governing equations of SH theory serve as a standard model for developing our
numerical model. Once the numerical scheme is so far, it will be extended into the two-phase
grain-fluid model such as Iverson and Denlinger [1997, 2001].
肆、研究方法
The rational shock-capturing schemes are based on fixed mesh, the so-called Eulerian
coordinate. In another words, the computational cells in using Eulerian coordinates are fixed in
space and the cell averages of the physical quantities will be computed. For numerical simulation,
the Eulerian coordinates do not encounter any difficulty, when there is no free moving boundary
within the computational domain. Nevertheless, in simulations for natural disaster such as debris
flows, it is of our interest how to determine the exact location of the boundary, where it could
locate within the computational cells and additional diffusion could be introduced during
computation. Without additional treatment, it is impossible to determine the boundary location by
using Eulerian coordinate. On the other hand, computational cells in the Lagrangian coordinates
are literally fluid particles/boundary, that the boundaries are automatically tracked. However, the

The earth pressure coefficients Kx and Ky link the normal pressures in the down and cross

motion is predominantly in the down slope direction Hutter et al. [1993] showed that

The first one-dimensional Lagrange-moving-grid method for SH model was proposed in
their original paper (Savage and Hutter [1989]), and was extended to two-dimensional model by
Koch et al. [1994] and Gray et al. [1999]. In this research we first generalized the governing
equations in curved and twisted coordinate, introduced by Pudasaini et al. [2003], into the

8theory and the simulated results of shock formation of rapid granular flows are showed in two
publications (Tai et al. 2005b and Tai el al. 2005c). For the Lagrangian- moving-grid technique
we generalized the governing equation and simulate a finite mass down a 90curved and twisted
channel.
The further work is to develop a Lagrange- Euler-Moving- Grid (SCLEMG) scheme, which
will combine the shock-capturing feature and moving boundary, that it can capture the shock
formation, and at the same time, describe the exact location of the boundary. The key point of
this task is the determination of the velocity of the cell boundaries. During this project we found
that this task is hardly to be carried out within several months. But our recent work can provide a
beginning to approach this final aim.
