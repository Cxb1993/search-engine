applications of gas sensors. 
 
2. Experimental 
The growth of carbon nanotubes was carried out by using thermal CVD 
system. Prior to CNTs growth, a 10 nm Fe thin film acting as catalyst was 
deposited on (100) n-type silicon substrate by RF sputtering system. The quartz 
tube was heated up to the growth temperature of 700°C, then only C2H2 gas was 
introduced with a flow rate of 30 sccm for the synthesis of CNTs. The reaction 
pressure and time were maintained at 4 Torr and 20 min. The surface morphology 
of CNTs was studied by FE-SEM, Raman, which operated at 15kV. Gas-sensing 
experiments were carried out by an ultrahigh vacuum measurement system. The 
CO2 and NH3 sensing process was as follows: two terminals of the device were 
fixed at 5V to measure the changes of electrical resistance under CO2 and NH3 
filling and pumping cycle. The partial pressure of CO2 and NH3 were changed from 
50ppm to 800ppm. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show cross-sectional and top-view FESEM images, 
respectively, of the CNTs prepared on Si substrates. It was found that the average 
length and average diameter of the CNTs were about ~4.5μm and ~45nm, 
respectively. Figure 2 shows Raman spectrum of our CNTs measured at room 
temperature. The extremely strong peak located at 1577cm-1 was originated from 
the silicon substrate. We also observed two Raman peaks located at 1340cm-1 
(D-band) and 1577cm-1(G-band), respectively. The intensity ratio of D- to G-band 
peaks of the sample was found to be 0.85. Figure 3(a) shows the response and 
recovery of the CNTs upon exposure to 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 ppm NH3 and 
CO2 concentration at room temperature. The initial response and recovery is steady 
and rapid. The sensitivity (S), of the sensor is defined as [(Rg-Ro) /Ro]×100 , where 
Ro is the electrical resistance of the sensor in air, and Rg is its resistance in NH3 and

4. Conclusion  
In summary, we reported the growth of CNTs on Si substrate by thermal 
CVD. It was found that the average length and average diameter of the CNTs were 
4.52 μm and 45 nm, respectively. Further, CNTs were operated under different NH3 
and CO2 concentration. From the results, it was also found that the CNTs have the 
larger sensitivity when measured under NH3 condition.
