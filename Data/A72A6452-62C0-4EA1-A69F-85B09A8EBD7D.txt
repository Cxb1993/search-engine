21. Introduction
Transition metal nitride is a protective coating to enhance properties of the substrate material. The 4th group transition metal
nitride TiN has been commercially utilized for cutting and mechanical tools, and the diffusion barriers in the semiconductor
industry. In addition, ZrN has attracted attention for its better corrosion resistance [1], lower resistivity [2], better mechanical
properties [3,4], and desirable golden color than the corresponding properties of TiN film [5]. Hardness is used for evaluating the
performance of mechanical properties of transition metal nitride. The (Ti,Zr)N coating shows an enhanced hardness compared
with the binary TiN and ZrN coatings deposited under the equivalent conditions [6,7]. This increased hardness shown by (Ti,Zr)N
coatings is due to a solid solution strengthening mechanism. Moreover, early studies on the effects of zirconium implantation on
TiN coatings have shown improved wear resistance [8,9].
In the study, the (Ti,Zr)N film deposition is carried out using a radio frequency magnetron sputter system. There are several
process parameters in the system such as substrate temperature, substrate bias, power of radio frequency, the position of the
substrate, and the nitrogen flow rate affecting the properties and characterization of the deposited thin film. Moreover, nitrogen
flow rate is the main parameter to affect the stoichiometry of (Ti,Zr)N thin film. In a review paper on the properties of TiN,
Sundgren summarized that stoichiometry may affect hardness [10]. From the collected data, he found that the hardness of
overstoichiometric (N/Ti>1) TiN film decreases with increasing N/Ti. One the other side, for an understoichiometric film, the
higher hardness is discovered. However, the content of nitrogen on the (Ti,Zr)N system has never been studied so far. This
purpose of this paper is to study the effect of nitrogen flow rate on properties of (Ti,Zr)N thin films produced by radio frequency
magnetron sputtering.
2. Experimental Details
The silicon wafers were chosen as the substrate materials. The substrates were 4-inch diameter and 0.525 mm thickness p-
type (001) silicon wafers. The wafer was cut into 1 cm * 1 cm, and then the specimens were cleaned ultrasonically in a bath of
acetone and ethanol progressively, each for 10 minutes, and dried for 20 minutes in a pre-vacuum dryer.
The (Ti,Zr)N film deposition was carried out using a radio frequency magnetron sputter system. To reduce the contamination,
the chamber was heated when the pump started, until the temperature of the chamber reached 400°C. Before the coating process,
the chamber was evacuated down to 1 ×10-4 Pa. During deposition process, high purity working argon gas and reactive nitrogen
gas were introduced and mass flow controllers were used to regulate both gas flows. Argon (99.9995%) gas flow rate was fixed at
15sccm with a maximum flow rate of 50 sccm. Nitrogen gas (99.9995%) flow was varied from 1 to 7 sccm with a maximum gas
flow controlled at 10 sccm. During deposition, a negative substrate bias voltage of 60 V was applied and the deposition
temperature was maintained at 400 ℃ monitored by using a thermocouple near the substrate. (Ti,Zr)N films were prepared from
reactive sputtering of alloy Ti- Zr target in Ar+N2 plasma operated at a pressure of 6.7 ×10
-1 Pa.
The crystal structure of the (Ti,Zr)N films was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a M18XHF-SRA diffractometer
with Cu Kαradiation. Furthermore, the result of θ/2θ scans was also used to determine the grain size of (Ti,Zr)N thin film. The full
width at half maximum (FWHM) and the position of diffraction peak were used to calculate the grain size by Scherrer equation.
4Figure 4 also support this argument. In the previous researches, there were no report of (Ti,Zr)N to appear in two phases of the
films during sputtering process [13]. However, it is feasible to materialize the nanocomposite of TiZr in the (Ti,Zr)N thin films by
controlling the nitrogen flow rate in the study.
Figure 5 shows the (111) and (200) texture coefficients with respect to nitrogen flow rate. The texture coefficient of (111) is
higher than texture coefficient of (200) in all samples. Theoretically speaking, (200) plane has the lowest surface energy in
transition metals nitride [14]. The change of growth direction from (002) to (111) was attributed to re-nucleation mechanism
proposed by Abadias et al. [15]. In our case, it is likely that kinetic energy and momentum of incident ions will increase with the
increasing bias voltage, promoting more re-nucleation sites and hence more grains grown along (111) orientations. However, the
texture coefficient of (111) decreased as the nitrogen flow rate increases. The intensive studies of atomistic process determining
TiN texture evolution were reported by Gall et al. [16]. They used ab inito density functional calculations to understand the
influence of the adsorption and desorption energies, surface diffusion activation energies and binding energies of Ti adatom, N
adatom, and other clusters on both planes of (111) and (200). In the high nitrogen partial pressure, a large number of N adatoms
resisted the Ti adatom diffused to (111) plane from (200) plane. The phenomenon of texture evolution also appeared in the solid
solution of (Ti,Zr)N.
3.2 Properties of (Ti,Zr)N thin films
Some conflict trends between processing parameters and the hardness of thin film were reported from time to time [17-19].
The addition of Zr into TiN (or addition of Zr into TiN) forms the substitutional solid solution (Ti,Zr)N. The discrepancy of
diameters of the atoms is smaller than 15 percent. The crystal structures of the two elements must be the same, not only Ti and Zr
are both HCP, but also TiN and ZrN are both FCC. There is no appreciable difference between the electronegativities of Ti and Zr
elements, and they both belong to the same IV family in the periodic table. The increased hardness shown by (Ti,Zr)N coatings is
due to a solid solution strengthening mechanism which provides an energy barrier to the movement of dislocations throughout the
crystals which have distortion of the periodic lattice caused by the adatoms of Ti and Zr during deposition. Moreover, texture
coefficient of (111) is an important factor to the film hardness [20,21]. It is known that <111> is the hardest orientation in
transition metal nitride due to the fact that Schmid factor is zero on all slip systems, the desirable hardness was observed in the
study. However, the variation of film hardness is not agreed with (111) texture coefficient, there is other factors to affect the
hardness of (Ti,Zr)N coatings. The grain size of all samples is not greater than 20 nm. Figure 6 shows the relation between
hardness and grain size, hardness increases with decrease of grain size. Ma et al. pointed out that the dislocation activity is
retarded by the nano-scale grain size, and the sliding or movement of the grain boundary becomes more difficult as the degree of
coherency associated grain boundaries increases [22]. The hardness of (Ti,Zr)N is related to the nano- grain size. This could
explain the result that film hardness is not directly dependent on the (111) preferred orientation.
The resistivity of the (Ti,Zr)N solid solution films is ranged from 72.3 to 224.1 -cm, which is much higher than the TiN
single-crystal film (18 -cm) or ZrN (14 -cm) single-crystal film [23]. This indicates that the nanocrystalline (Ti,Zr)N films
contain much higher defect density than the single crystal film. The defects are summarized as follows, impurities as
