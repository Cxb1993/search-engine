The direct problem can be solved to obtain the 
dimensionless temperature field. A fully implicit numerical 
scheme in which the x-direction convection term is 
approximated by the upstream difference, the y-direction 
diffusion term by the central difference and the unsteady term 
by the backward difference is employed to transform the 
governing equations into finite difference equations. This 
system of equations forms a tridiagonal matrix which can be 
solved by the Thomas Algorithm [13]. 
 
Inverse Problem 
In the direct problem, the velocity distribution, the initial 
condition, and the boundary conditions are given to determine 
the temperature distribution in the flow field and the plate. In 
the inverse problem, the temperature data are assumed to be 
measured inside the flow or at the interface between fluid and 
wall. The dimensionless heat flux at the upper wall, ( )τ,XQ , 
is recovered by using the measured data. The estimation of the 
wall heat flux from the knowledge of the measured temperature 
data can be constructed as a problem of minimization of the 
objective function

where ( )kifk,i,f ,Y,X τθθ 1=  is the calculated dimensionless 
temperature for an estimated ( )τ,XQ , ( )kik,i ,Y,XZZ τ1=  is 
the measured dimensionless temperature. If 01 =Y , the 
measurements are taken at the lower interface between the fluid 
and wall; if 10 1 << Y , the measurements are taken inside the 
fluid; if 11 =Y , the measurements are taken at the upper 
interface between the fluid and wall. M and N are the numbers 
of the measured points in the X and τ directions, respectively. 
In this paper, the conjugate gradient method [14] is 
employed to determine the unknown wall heat flux ( )τ,XQ  
by minimizing the objective function, J . The detailed iterative 
process is illustrated in the previous study [10]. 
If the problem contains no measurement errors, the 
condition 
ϕ<)Q(J p n,m                                   (4) 
can be used for terminating the iterative process, where ϕ  is a 
small specified positive number. However, the measured 
temperature data contain measurement errors. Following the 
computational experience, we use the discrepancy principle 
[15] 
2σMN)Q(J p n,m <                                 (5) 
as the stopping criterion, where σ  is the standard deviation of 
the measurement errors. 
The computational procedure for the solution of the inverse 
convection problem is summarized as follows: 
Step 1: Solve the sensitivity problem to calculate the sensitivity 
coefficient 
n,m
k,i,f
Q∂

. Step 2: Pick an initial guess 0 n,mQ . Set p = 
0. Step 3: Solve the direct problem to compute k,i,fθ . Step 4: 
Calculate the objective function. Terminate the iteration 
process if the specified stopping criterion is satisfied.  
Otherwise go to step 5. Step 5: Knowing

relatively amplified when the σ  is increased from 0.03 to 
0.06, compared to that when σ  is changed from 0.06 to 0.09. 
It is also found that the more in accurate estimated results are 
noted for the channel with a thicker wall. 
 
Table 1 The absolute average errors at different σ  and λ  
for wall heating condition of case 1. 
 
The sensor location in the y-direction is an important 
parameter affecting the estimated results in the inverse 
problem. To examine the effects of the sensor location on the 
estimated wall heat flux, Fig.3 shows the estimated and exact 
results at different sensor locations 1Y  (= 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8) for 
the condition of σ = 0.01 and λ = 0.2. A careful inspection of 
Fig.3 appears that the deviations between the estimated and 
exact results become significant when the 1Y  is decreased. 
This means that the error of the estimated heat flux is larger as 
the sensor location is more far from the top plate. This is in 
agreement with the general concept in the inverse analysis that 
the more far away the unknown wall heat flux the sensors are, 
the more inaccurate the estimation is. In addition, the absolute 
average error is about 0.137 as 1Y  = 0.0, σ = 0.09 and λ = 
0.2. The corresponding relative error is about 1.37%, where the 
relative error is defined as the absolute average error divided by 
the maximum wall heat flux. This confirms that in the present 
study, the proposed method is excellent even the estimated 
conditions are strict.

Fig.3 Estimation of the wall heat flux by inverse analysis for 
wall heating condition of case 1 (σ = 0.01, 20.=λ ). 
 
According to the description of Fig. 3, the relationship 
among the absolute average error, the measurement error and 
the sensor location is also interesting in the inverse problem. 
Figure 4 presents the distributions of the absolute average error 
for various conditions of the absolute average error, the 
measurement error and the sensor location. It is clearly 
observed from Fig.4 that the absolute average error is rapidly 
reduced when 1Y  is raised from 0.2 to 0.6. But, the absolute 
average error does not decay with an increase in 1Y  when 1Y  
is closer to the top plate ( 1Y > 0.8). This is due to the fact when 
the sensor location is close to the top plate, and the accuracy of 
the estimated result would be affected by the thermal boundary 
layer. In addition, the absolute average error is about 0.175, 
even the sensor location is located at 1Y  = 0.0 with 
measurement error σ  being 0.09. In general, despite the value 
of σ , a better estimation appears when the sensor location is 
closer to the unknown wall heat flux boundary. Namely, an 
accurate value of estimated heat flux could result either from a 
low value of the measurement error, which would indicate a 
better convergence in the present proposed method, or from a 
sensor location nearer the heat flux boundary. Moreover, we 
notice that the estimated result is more accurate as the plate is 
thinner regardless of σ  and 1Y .

Fig.4 Effects of sensor location on the absolute average error of 
the estimated heat flux for wall heating condition of case 1 
( 010.=σ , 00.=λ ). 
 
To further test the applicability of the proposed method, 
the applied wall heat flux is changed to be case 2. The effects 
of the plate thickness, the measurement error and the sensor 
location are investigated again. This clarifies that the proposed 
method is suitable to deal with the different forms of wall heat 
flux. 
Fig. 5 shows the estimated heat fluxes at X  = 0.3, 0.6, 
0.9 under different sensor locations ( 1Y  = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8) for 
wall heating conditions of case 2. A careful examination of 
Fig.5 indicates that a larger deviation between the estimated 
and exact results is noted for a larger X  (= 0.9). Besides, the 
value of the estimated result increases with an increase in the 
location X. The reason is that the heat flux is dependent on X  
and accumulates its value as X  increases. The effects of 
sensor location 1Y  can be found in this figure. Like Fig. 3, the

II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL 
The purpose of this paper is to obtain the modified Verlet 
list in the larger momentum molecular system. The 2-D lid-
driven cavity flow problems are examined numerically by MD 
with the leap-frog method and the modified Verlet list. 
In addition, the leap-frog method is chosen in this study 
[12]-[13]. The instantaneous velocity of molecule is corrected 
at each time step, and the correction of molecular velocity is 
listed as below.

where N  is the number of molecules in the specified region, 
*
aT  is the instantaneous dimensionless temperature of the 
specified region after all of the colliding processes at each 
time step, *sT  is the initial dimensionless temperature of the 
specified region, *iv  is the dimensionless velocity of the i -th 
molecule after a colliding process at each time step ,and new*,iv  
is the dimensionless corrected molecular velocity of the i -th 
molecule. 
Based on the statistical thermodynamics, it is known that 
the initial velocities of the molecules in the equilibrium system 
are distributed according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity 
distribution while the temperature of the isolated system is 
fixed. In the simulated equilibrium process, the molecular 
velocity is correlated at each time step and leads to the 
equilibrium state when the system is maintained to be a 
particular temperature. The Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity 
distribution means that, if the dimensionless temperature of 
the system is *T , the probability of the i-th molecule having a 
dimensionless velocity value between *v  and ** dvv +  is

In addition, the net momentum of the system must be equal 
to zero in order to guarantee that the system will not move due 
to an external force. The conservation conditions for the 
momentum are described as below.

where *ip  is the dimensionless momentum of the i-th 
molecule. 
Verlet list assumed that the displacement of each molecule 
is not too large in a short time. In addition, the second cut-off 
radius vr  is introduced. The molecules within the radius, vr , 
of molecule, i , are listed before the interaction between two 
molecules is calculated. Therefore, we just only consider the 
interaction among those molecules within the Verlet list. But, 
it is not easy to decide how many time steps we need to update 
the Verlet list in the larger momentum system. In this paper, 
the mechanism of the list updating is controlled by the 
momentum of each molecule. The modified Verlet list is 
updating as the number of the molecule, this number’s 
displacement is larger than cv rr − , is larger than a critical 
value. In this research, the displacement, D , of each molecule 
(either the listed molecule or the un-listed one) will be check 
in each time step. In addition, US +  is defined as the number 
of the molecule which is different with the Verlet list in each 
time step, where S  is the number of the listed molecule which 
departs from the Verlet list in each time step, and U  is the 
number of the un-listed molecule which gets into the Verlet 
list in each time step. As US +  is larger than a critical value 
cM , the modified Verlet list is updated. 
III. SIMULATION DETAILS 
In this paper, the modified Verlet list is proposed to study 
the MD problem with the leap-frog method. Here, the 2-D lid-
driven cavity flow problems are the test examples in this 
research. 
Our simulations consider twelve models which have 
=N 656, 1092, 1640, and 1956 water molecules, and the 
motion of the top plate is uniform and moves in the negative 
x -direction, the dimensionless velocity of the top boundary is 
assumed as -20, -40, and -80, respectively. In addition, an 
extended length is allowed, and the fluid is always enclosed by 
the top plate. The wall boundary condition is considered to be 
the position that the water is absorbed intact on the wall [14]. 
The initial system of =N 656 is shown in Fig. 1. The 
interaction between two water molecules is modeled by the 
Lennard-Jones potential. The parameters of this simulation are 
listed as below. 
Repulsive core (

( J. 211091154 −×=ε ), and the mass of water 
( kg.m 271010330 −×= ) [15], then the dimensionless Lennard-
Jones potential is

Step 6 Repeat the process of step 2 to obtain the 
acceleration. 
Step 7 Add a dimensionless velocity to the top plate in 
the negtive x -direction to induce the lid-driven

Step 8 Calculate the new position and velocity of each 
molecule from leap frog method. 
Step 9 Consider the boundary condition and the 
different list algorithms to correlate the position 
and velocity of each molecule and the caculating 
list. 
Step 10 In order to maintain the temperature and the 
momentum conservation of the system, we must 
correlate the velocity of each molecule through 
Eqs. (1) and (3) at each time step. 
Step 11 Terminate the process if the computed time 
approaches, otherwise the computation is 
returned to step 6. 
 
V. RESULTS AND DISSCUSSIONS 
The numbers of molecule which are generated by the 
molecule run into or over the range of list are recorded in the 
various momentum systems. The average number of US +  is 
defined as that the accumulated US +  divided by the 
molecular number in the system along the time evolution. It 
represents that the quantity deviates from the Verlet list. The 
first, the effect of the molecular number in the system is 
observed. In Figs. 3 and 4, the average US +  is shown in the 
different velocity of the upper plate (-20 and -40), respectively. 
In addition, the numbers of the molecule are 656、1092、
1640 and 1956, separately. It is clear that the average US +  is 
140000 and 180000 as the time step is 6102× , separately. 
This represents that the effect of the number of molecule is 
slightly significant. 
In Fig. 5, the average number of US +  with the various 
top boundary velocity (-20, -40, and -80) and the different size 
of the cavity (N=656, 1092, 1640, and 1956) is presented. 
Overall inspection of Fig. 5 discloses that the value of the 
average US +  is 140000, 180000 and 260000 at 
804020 −−−= ,,V  as the run is at 2000000. It represents that 
the opportunity of the molecule in the system departs from or 
gets into the range of vr  in each time step is 7% as the top 
plate velocity is 20−=V , and higher to 9% at 40−=V , 13% 
at 80−=V . That is to say that the probability of the updating 
of list is 7%, 9% and 13% in each time step at 
804020 −−−= ,,V , respectively.  
Thus it can be seen that, for avoiding to simplify the 
problem as the Verlet list is used in the larger momentum 
system. We would update the list in few time steps, but loss 
the original meaning of the Verlet list ( the CPU time saving ).
