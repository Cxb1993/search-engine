ABSTRACT 
The high-power Light Emitting Diode 
(LED), which features low-power 
 4  
temperature tester and thermal couples), a 
thermal resistance circuit (TRC) method, a 
finite element method (FEM) and a 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
approach.  The junction temperature (Tj) 
of the COP package was measured by the 
junction temperature tester and found to 
be comparable with those from 
commercial products, such as Cree’s, and 
Lumiled’s packages. Furthermore, the 
TRC and FEM were used for addressing 
the thermal fields of the COP package 
with and without a heat sink.  The results 
of the thermal fields including the Tj from 
the experiments, FEM and TRC were 
found to be reasonably consistent under 
various input powers for the COP 
package, but not for the package with a 
heat sink. Moreover, the under-estimated 
thermal fields of the package with a heat 
sink from both FEM and TRC analyses 
were evaluated again by the CFD 
approach. The results indicate that the heat 
convection coefficients on the heat sink 
used the FEM and TRC analyses are 
higher than those calculated from the 
CFD. Finally, the reasonable and validated 
FEM and TRC models were used for 
parametric studies and their results show 
that the thermal conductivities of the die 
attach, chip substrate and package 
substrate (rather than the heat sink, chip, 
thermal grease and encapsulant) have an 
obvious effect on the Tj. In addition, for 
reducing the Tj, increasing the radius of 
the heat sink was found to be more 
beneficial than increasing the height. 
 
Introduction 
In order to reduce the electric energy 
consumption for alleviating the global 
warming problem, the high-power Light 
Emitting Diode (LED), which features low 
power consumption, longer life time and 
shorter response time, has a potential to 
replace the conventional general lighting, 
such as incandescent and fluorescent 
lamps [1]. However, the LED issues, 
associated with high cost, high junction 
temperature, low luminous efficiency, and 
low reliability, have to be solved before 
gaining more market penetration. It is well 
known that high junction temperature of 
the LEDs would lead to reliability 
problems such as low quantum efficiency, 
wavelength shifts, short lifetime, and even 
catastrophic failure [2-4]. Recently in 
order to increase luminous efficiency and 
light output for general lighting 
application, high-power LED array 
packages have been proposed and active 
cooling systems have been used to provide 
heat dissipation solutions [5-8], even 
though the passive cooling systems are 
preferable due to low cost. The effect of 
die attach properties on the junction 
temperature of high power LED was 
studied by in-situ junction temperature 
measurement [9]. In the present study, 
with special features of 
low-junction-temperature and low-cost 
 6  
geometry like the LED package, the 
convection coefficient in nature 
convection (hE ) can be expressed as 
 
0.83 ( / )nE chh f T L= Δ        (5) 
 
where the ΔT is the temperature difference 
between on package surface and in 
ambient, the Lch is the characteristic length 
and the f and n are the constants, defined 
in Table 1. 
However, the size of the heat sink is not 
as small as the package, so that the 
different convection coefficients based on 
Holman [10] are given by

Thermal Resistance Circuit Method 
In the electronic or optoelectronic 
packaging, the thermal resistance is one of 
main parameters generally used for 
showing the performance of heat 
dissipation of the packages [12]. The 
lower the thermal resistance, the better the 
heat dissipation of the packages. The 
thermal resistance is defined as

operating current MV ,: voltage for 
measuring current in duty time. The 
junction temperature tester used in this 
study was designed using the 
mentioned-above principle. There were 
three specimens under three different 
input powers (0.96W, 1.22W, 1.47W, or 
278 mA, 344mA, 402 mA) were carried 
out and the Tj were recorded individually. 
In addition, the thermal couples were 
employed to measure the temperatures of 
the lens, aluminum substrate and copper 
heat sink.

Finite Element Method    
ANSYS 9.0, a commercial finite 
element code, was used in this study. The 
2-D axi-symmetrical model was used in 
the analysis and shown in Fig. 4. Its 
assumptions include 
(1) The holes in aluminum substrate   
      and aluminum wires are not  
      modeled 
(2) Perfect bonding between each    
      material interfaces. 
(3)  The heat transfer is mainly on 
nature convection but thermal 
radiation is neglected. 
(4) There is 78% input power 
transferring into heat, which is 
uniformly distributed over the 
entire chip volume.  
Material thermal conductivity for LED 
package and module listed in Table 2 are 
used in this analysis. The convection 
coefficients for the package are from the 
equation (5) associated with Table 1, but 
those for the heat sink are from the 
equations (6)-(8) due to the relatively 
large size. The calculation has to be 
iterated until temperature converges due to 
the convection coefficients as function of 
the surface temperature. Three input 
powers (0.96W, 1.22W, and 1.47W) were 
used in this analysis.

from experimental measurements 
 
The junction temperatures and thermal 
resistances of COP LED packages under 
various powers (0.96W, 1.22W, and 
1.47W) are shown in Fig 6(a) and (b), 
respectively, determined from 2D FEM, 
TRC, and experiments. The results of 
junction temperature from 2D FEM and 
TRC show the linear dependence on the 
input power.  Although both results have 
a slight difference, they are in reasonable 
agreement with the experimental data. 
Furthermore, the thermal resistances of 
junction to air, to lens and to case, shown 
in Fig. 6(b), from 2D FEM and partly 
from TRC are consistent with those from 
experiments.

under various powers (0.96W, 1.22W, 1.47W, or 
278 mA, 344mA, 402 mA) 
 
After the verification of the thermal 
analysis of the package, the thermal 
behavior of the module was further 
measured and analyzed. In Fig. 7, the 
junction temperatures of COP LED 
module, determined from CFD, 2D FEM, 
and TRC, under various powers (0.96W, 
1.22W, and 1.47W) are compared with 
those from experiments. Unlike the results 
of the packages, the junction temperatures

substrate (Al), and copper heat sink (Cu) for the 
COP LED module, determined from 2D FEM, 
CFD, and experiment under the power of 1.47 W 
(I=402mA) 
 
Even though the 2D FEM and TRC 
gave approximate solutions after 
comparison with experimental result, both 
analyses are still good enough to provide 
the key material and geometrical 
parameters for reducing the junction 
temperature. The effect of the normalized 
thermal conductive coefficient (k/kref) on 
the junction temperature for the COP LED 
module is shown in Fig. 10 (a) and (b) for 
2D FEM and TRC analyses, respectively. 
Note that k/kref =1 representing the current 
case in which the material properties are 
listed in Table 2.  From 2D FEM results, 
it can be seen that the junction 
temperature is quite dependent on the 
thermal conductivities of the chip 
substrate, package substrate, and die 
attach as k/kref <1, but less sensitive as 
k/kref >1. And the junction temperature is 
insensitive to the thermal conductivities of 
the encapulant and chip. The TRC results 
indicate the similar phenomenon, but with 
low junction temperature values. The 
dependence of junction temperature for 
the COP LED module on geometrical 
parameters such as height (H), radius (R), 
and height and radius (H&R) of the 
copper heat sink was analyzed with 2D 
FEM analysis.  The results are shown in 
Fig. 11 for the COP LED module under 
the power of 1.47 W (I=402mA). It is 
shown that the increase of the R is more 
beneficial than the H in terms of reducing 
the junction temperature, but 
simultaneously increasing the R and H has 
a similar result to increasing only the R.  
The junction temperature reduction is less 
obvious as those three parameters increase 
beyond the factor of 32.

replace the conventional general lighting, 
such as incandescent and fluorescent 
lamps [1]. However, the LED issues, 
associated with high cost, high junction 
temperature, low luminous efficiency, and 
low reliability, have to be solved before 
gaining more market penetration. It is well 
known that high junction temperature of 
the LEDs would lead to reliability 
problems such as low quantum efficiency, 
wavelength shifts, short lifetime, and even 
catastrophic failure [2-4]. The effect of die 
attach properties on the junction 
temperature for high-power LEDs was 
studied by in-situ junction temperature 
measurement [5].  In the present study, a 
novel package module for high-power 
LED, so called COP (Chip on Plate) 
module, are proposed and their thermal 
resistances and reliability under wet high 
temperature operation life (WHTOL) test 
and thermal shock test are evaluated. The 
configurations of COP LED package 
module are shown in Fig. 1 with details of 
geometries and materials. The thermal 
behaviors of the COP package module 
under natural and forced convection 
conditions are investigated by a 
computational fluid dynamics approach 
and compared with experimental 
measurements.

Fundamental Heat Transfer 
The heat transfer from the high 
temperature spot to low-temperature one 
is mainly by three ways (conduction, 
convection, and radiation). The heat 
conduction behavior happens within or 
between solids, while the heat convection 
takes place within fluids or between solid 
and fluid [6]. Heat conduction equation is 
described by：

The pulse input current is used for 
measuring the junction temperature. In 
order to ensure that the LED reaches to the 
thermal steady state, the driving current 
was required to keep lighting the LED 
about 20-minute duration time. In the duty 
time, the measurement pulse current 
(IM=0.1mA) has only 1ms for generating 
the LED voltage drop. During the test, the 
different voltage ( V, voltage drop) △
between the initial-state voltage (VMi) and 
measurement-state (IM) is caused by rising 
junction temperature. Then, the junction 
temperature (Tj) can be described and 
determined by the following equations:

where β : calibration factor, aT : air

difference from the junction to air 
temperature, MiV : voltage for initial 
operating current, MV : voltage for 
measuring current in duty time. The 
junction temperature tester used in this 
study was designed using the 
mentioned-above principle. There were 
three specimens under input powers 
(1.22W) were carried out and the Tj were 
recorded individually. In addition, the 
thermal couples were employed to 
measure the surface temperatures of the 
aluminum substrate and heat sink. 
Computational Fluid Dynamics 
CFDesign 9.0, a commercial 
computational fluid dynamics code, was 
used in this study. The 3D computational 
fluid dynamics model (CFD model) was 
employed for eliminating the assumptions 
and iterated calculations of the convection 
coefficients. The main assumptions of this 
model consist of the following: 
(1) There is a cubic domain, with seven 
times the size of the LED module, 
surrounding the module. 
(2) The holes in aluminum substrate and 
aluminum wires are not modeled. 
(3) Perfect bonding is between each 
material interfaces. 
(4) The heat transfer is mainly on 
convections but thermal radiation is 
neglected. 
(5) There is 86% input power 
transferring into heat, which is 
uniformly distributed over the entire 
chip volume.  
Material thermal properties for LED 
module are listed in Table 1. For boundary 
conditions (room temperature and 
convections), the top surface of the 
domain was assigned as the flow outlet 
with zero pressure difference, while the 
other five surfaces of the domain were 
specified by assuming room temperature 
of 22  and zero fluid velocity in the x, y ℃
and z directions. The laminar flow 
behavior was adopted within the domain

experiments, under the power of 1.22 W 
(I=350mA). 
Two groups of COP LED package 
modules: one with blue-light LEDs, the 
other with phosphor-converted white-light 
LEDs have been tested in the WHTOL test. 
The survival number of the specimens for 
both groups is shown in Fig. 4. It can be 
seen that all the blue-light COP package 
modules could pass 1008-hr duration 
during the test, but for all the 
phosphor-converted white-light COP 
package modules failed after 309-hr 
duration. Subsequently, the failure modes 
of these white-light COP package modules 
were observed and confirmed by means of 
a simple verification method of utilizing a 
small tube to press the silicone of the COP 
package powered by forward current to 
see if the failed specimens can be lighted 
again. When these failed white-light COP 
package modules can be lighted up by this 
method, it indicates that the failure of the 
white-light COP package modules were 
caused by aluminum wire debonding to 
the chip and copper pads of the substrate. 
These failure modes were also confirmed 
by microscopic observations. In general, 
the strength of the gold wire bonding was 
greater than that of the aluminum wire 
bonding. The two groups of COP LED 
package modules (without silicone): one 
with aluminum wire bonding, the other 
with gold wire bonding, were tested by 
wire pull test. The obtained results shown 
in Fig. 5, indicate that the average 
maximum failure force of the COP 
package modules with gold wire bonding 
is larger than that with aluminum wire 
bonding by up to 3.9g. Thus, in order to 
further improve the reliability of the 
white-light COP package modules during 
WHTOL test, the aluminum wire bonding 
of the COP package modules, was 
replaced with gold wire bonding. All blue- 
and white-light COP package modules 
with the gold wire bonding eventually 
passed for 1008-hr duration as shown in 
Fig 6.

85°C/85%RH/natural convection is about 
67°C which is close to 63°C (=85°C 
-22°C). As a result, the junction-to-air 
thermal resistances at both conditions are 
nearly the same.  
 
 
Fig. 8 Comparison of (a)junction temperatures and 
(b) thermal resistances of junction to air for COP 
package module under  22°C/natural convection, 
85°C/85%RH/natural convection, and 
85°C/85%RH/forced convection (with 1 m/s flow), 
from 3D CFDesign and experiment (within 0.5 hr). 
On the contrary, these values at the 
85°C/85%RH/forced convection condition 
(with 1 m/s flow) are lower than those at 
85°C/85%RH/natural convection 
condition by up to about 21°C for the 
average junction temperature and 17°C/W 
for junction-to-air thermal resistance, 
respectively. However, the thermal 
resistances of junction to aluminum 
substrate at both conditions are in a good 
agreement. The reason for this significant 
decrease of the thermal resistances of 
junction to air is that the forced 
convection in the chamber provides the 
higher the thermal convection coefficient 
on the surface of COP package modules. 
Furthermore, the thermal resistance 
variation for COP package modules under 
85°C/85%RH/natural convection and 
85°C/85%RH/forced convection (with 
flow velocity from 1 to 4 m/s) in the 
chamber is shown in Fig. 9 obtained from 
3D CFDesign and experiments. The 
results indicate that the thermal resistances 
of junction to air are sensitive to the flow 
conditions and decrease apparently with 
flow velocity increasing from 1 to 4m/s. 
However, the thermal resistances of 
junction to aluminum substrate and to heat 
sink aren’t significantly dependent on the 
flow conditions. As a result, during 
general WHTOL test, the air flow 
conditions in the humidity chamber would 
affect the variation of reliability data. 
Therefore, for the standard WHTOL test 
flow conditions in the test chamber should 
be specified.

PART3: Optical Analysis and 
Measurements of High-Power 
COP LED Packages 
 
Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to 
investigate the optical behaviors and thus 
maximize luminous efficiency (focusing 
on light extraction efficiency here) of 
high–power chip-on-plate (COP) LED 
packages with the low-cost feature. First 
of all, to validate the luminous flux and 
candela distribution measurements and 
TracePro (one of commercial optical 
software) simulation, a Lumiled K1 LED 
package (one of commercially-available 
packages) is analyzed numerically and 
experimentally and compared with given 
data sheet. After the validation, both 
measurements and TracePro are applied to 
studying the candela distribution and light 
extraction efficiency of the COP LED 
packages. Furthermore, parametric studies 
of lens cavity height-radius ratio (h/r) and 
cup angle of COP LED packages using 
TracePro are implemented to find out the 
key factors to the light extraction 
efficiency. The results show that the 
candela distribution of COP LED 
packages from TracePro simulation is 
consistent with that from experiments. In 
optical parametric study, the effect of lens 
cavity height-radius ratio (h/r) of the COP 
LED packages on light extraction is found 
to be negligible, except for h/r=0. 
Moreover, with given lens cavity, the 
effect of air gap between silicone 
encapsulant and lens on light extraction is 
apparent by a way that air gap decreases 
with increasing light extraction. Also, it is 
found that the cup angle below 60° does 
not apparently affect light extraction, but 
beyond 60°, light extraction increases with 
the cup angle. 
Keywords: LED, simulation, light 
extraction efficiency, candela distribution. 
 
Introduction 
In order to reduce the electrical energy 
consumption for alleviating the global 
warming problem, the high-power light 
emitting diode (LED), which features low 
power consumption, longer life time and 
shorter response time, has a potential to 
replace the conventional general lighting, 
such as incandescent and fluorescent 
lamps[1]. However, the LED issues 
associated with high cost, high junction 
temperature, low luminous efficiency, and 
low reliability have to be solved before 
gaining more market penetration. 
Therefore, how to increase the light 
 26 
luminous flux of the light which will be 
integrated all over the entire surface of the 
sphere afterwards. The CAS 140CT 
system from Instrument Systems 
Company with a 50 cm integrating sphere 
is used in this study.

view in COP LED packages.  
The photogoniometer: it is to measure 
the lamps and lanterns light intensity from 
every angle. Then the intensity at every 
angle can be obtained. Therefore, it can be 
used to measure the candela distribution 
and view angle for LED packages. The 
measurements of the candela distribution 
for these packages are similar in x and y 
directions. Thus only measurement in the 
x direction for these two packages is 
shown in this study. The VA-280 LED 
photogoniometer from Wei Min Industrial 
Company is used to measure the view 
angle in this study. 
C. Modeling 
   TracePro is one of the popular tools 
for simulating the luminous flux and the 
candela distribution. The TracePro 5.0, 
one of the commercial codes, is used in 
the analysis. And it can be applied to 
simulate the light pipes, backlight light, 
camera system, project system, LED 
designs and applications. Thus this 
software will be used to simulate a 
Lumiled K1 (LLK1) and COP LED 
packages without phosphors. The optical 
material properties used are shown in 
Table 1 for COP LED package. First of all, 
the geometries of these two LED packages 
are built up using SolidWork software. 
The geometric models are put into the 
TracePro including the material properties. 
The candela distribution and the light 
extraction efficiency can be obtained from 
the analysis.

the simulation and experiment for COP LED 
packages 
After the model verification, this optical 
model can be applied to the geometry 
parametric study for better design of 
aluminum substrate, lens and silicone 
encapsulant in terms of light extraction 
efficiency.  Height-radius ratio (h/r) of 
lens cavity, air gap and cup angle for the 
COP LED packages are considered in this 
study to find out their effects on light 
extraction efficiency. The ratio of height 
and radius for the lens cavity affects the 
light extraction efficiency for COP LED 
package is shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen 
that the effect of h/r of lens cavity on light 
extraction is negligible, except for h/r=0. 
When h/r equals zero, it means there is no 
cavity between lens and silicone 
encapsulant, plus the refraction indices of 
lens and silicone are similar. Hence the 
light extraction efficiency for h/r =0 has 
relatively high value.

(h/r) on light extraction efficiency 
Moreover, the effect of air gap on light 
extraction efficiency is also shown in Fig. 
6. It indicates that light extraction 
efficiency keep unchanged as the silicone 
convex height (hs) is less than 0.3mm, but 
increases as hs is greater than 0.3mm and 
reaches to the maximum as the air gap is 
fully filled.  In another word, it means 
the light extraction efficiency increases 
with air gap decreasing.  
 
Fig. 6 The effect of the air gap on light extraction 
efficiency 
Finally, the effect of the reflector cup 
angle on the light extraction efficiency is 
investigated with variation of the cup 
angle from 0° to 70°. It is noted that the 
cup angle is defined as an angle between a 
plane normal and an oblique surface in the 
COP cavity of the aluminum substrate. 
The results shown in Fig. 7 indicate that 
the effect of cup angle below 60° does not 
apparently affect light extraction, but 
beyond that, light extraction increases 
with the cup angle.
