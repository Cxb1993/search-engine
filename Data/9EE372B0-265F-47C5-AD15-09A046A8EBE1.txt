2 
responses are concentrated in the isolation 
bearings. The force-displacement 
relationship of typical elastomeric isolation 
bearings is nonlinear as a result of their 
inherent damping properties. The accurate 
prediction of the seismic behavior of 
base-isolated structures depends strongly on 
the accuracy of the analytical model of the 
isolation bearings. 
In recent years, a few mathematical 
models of high damping rubber (HDR) 
bearings have been proposed. Hwang et al [2] 
proposed a mathematical model modified 
from Pan and Yang’s model [3]. The number 
of parameters used by Pan and Yang are 
reduced, and the model is extended to be 
capable of describing the Mullins effect and 
scragging effect of high damping rubber 
bearings. 
A mathematical model of high damping 
elastomeric isolation bearings proposed by 
Hwang et al has been validated by the cyclic 
loading test of HDR materials. In this work, 
this model will be validated using cyclic 
loading tests of HDR bearings. In addition, 
this proposed model of HDR isolation 
bearings will be used to predict seismic 
responses of a base-isolated multistory 
building tested by a shaking table. 
3. Analytical Model of HDR Isolation 
Bearings 
In the mathematical model proposed by 
Hwang et al, the shear force experienced by 
the HDR bearing is attributed to the sum of 
the restoring force and the damping force. 
The model is written in the form of 
1 2( , ) ( , ) ( , )F u u F u u F u u= +    (1)
where ( , )F u u  is the shear force 
transmitted by the bearing which is 
composed of the restoring force 1( , )F u u  
and the damping force 2 ( , )F u u . Both the 
restoring force and damping force are 
functions of the relative displacement (u ) 
and relative velocity (u ) of the bearing.

In this work, the model proposed by 
Hwang et al will be validated using cyclic 
loading tests of HDR bearings. The test 
setup is shown in Figures 1. In this test, each 
set of HDR bearings were deformed laterally 
with cyclic sinusoidal waves that deduced a 
maximum shear strain ranging from 50% to 
200% with a step increment of 50%. Three 
excitation frequencies, 0.25 Hz , 0.5 Hz , and 
1 Hz  are selected for the test. Three axial 
loads, 25 2/kg cm , 50 2/kg cm , and 
75 2/kg cm  are prescribed. Each test was 
conducted for three cyclic reversals. 
The 10 parameters of Eqs. (2) and (3) can 
be identified by the best fit to the cyclic 
loading test results. The best fit to the test 
results can be solved using nonlinear least 
square method [4] with the aid of the 
mathematical tools of MATLAB [5]. 
However, since the identification is 
performed in a 10 variable space, many local 
minima may exist in the identification 
process. Nevertheless, it is not the aim of 
this study to establish the relationship of 
these 10 parameters to the aforementioned 
influence factors, but to demonstrate the 
capability of the proposed model in 
predicting the force–displacement hysteresis 
of HDR bearings and the seismic response 
of base-isolated structures by HDR bearings. 
The effect of frequency under an axial 
load of 43.38 kN  is summarized in Figure 2. 
The parameters used for the analytical 
prediction are identified in Tables 1. From 
figure, it is seen that the measured and the 
calculated hysteresis loops have an excellent 
agreement. Therefore, the proposed model is 
validated for its capability of predicting the 
bearing behavior under different excitation 
frequencies. 
The effect of frequency under different 
axial loads is also studied. The axial load 
was changed to 86.77 kN . Figure 3 shows 
the measured and predicted hysteresis loops 
under different excitation frequencies. The 
parameters used for the analytical prediction 
4 
proposed model is capable of accurately 
predicting the seismic response of a 
base-isolated multistory building subjected 
to different ground excitations. 
In the second approach, a single set of 10 
parameters is obtained from the combined 
hysteresis loops of two shaking table tests. 
The arbitrarily selected two tests are the 
200% ELC270 and 200% Sannomaru tests. 
This single set of 10 parameters will be used 
to predict the seismic response of structural 
model under the other two ground 
excitations (100% KJM000 and 300% 
TCU047). However, only the 300% 
TCU047 of the Chi-chi earthquake is used 
herein to illustrate the calculation procedure. 
The comparisons of the measured and 
predicted relative displacement and absolute 
acceleration response histories of the base 
slab and superstructure under 300% 
TCU047 ground excitation are shown in 
Figures 7 and 8. From figures can be seen 
that the measured and predicted relative 
displacements and absolute acceleration 
responses under differences seven grounds 
excitation have show a good agreement.  
The significance of this result is that the 
identified single set of parameters from the 
combined hysteresis loops of two shaking 
table tests (200% ELC270 and 200% 
Sannomaru tests) can accurately predict the 
seismic responses of the structure subjected 
to two different ground excitations (100% 
KJM000 and 300% TCU047). Therefore, it 
can be concluded that the mathematic model 
with the 10 parameters identified from a 
number of appropriate ground shakings can 
be extended to accurately predict the seismic 
responses of base-isolated structures 
subjected to other ground motions than those 
used for the identification of the 10 
parameters. 
5. Conclusion 
a. In this work, a mathematical model of 
HDR bearings proposed by Hwang et al 
has been validated by the cyclic loading 
tests of HDR bearings. The proposed 
model is proved to be capable of 
accurately predicting HDR bearing 
behavior under different axial load and 
different excitation frequencies. 
b. In addition, the proposed model is also 
capable of predicting the seismic 
responses of a base-isolated multistory 
building tested by a shaking table. The 
10 parameters of the mathematical 
model to be used in analysis were 
obtained from the hysteresis loops 
obtained from each of the seven shaking 
table tests, and the prediction of the 
seismic responses of the isolated 
structure showed that the model can 
simulate the seismic behavior of HDR 
bearings with fidelity. 
c. In another approach, a single set of 10 
parameters was identified from the 
combined hysteresis loops of only two of 
all shaking table tests. The identified 
model was then used to predict test 
results including the tests whose 
measured hysteresis loops of the 
bearings were not used for the 
identification of the 10 parameters. 
d. The proposed model of HDR isolation 
bearing is capable of accurately 
predicting the response of a 
base-isolated multistory structure to 
other ground motions than the ground 
motions from which the 10 parameters 
of the model are identified.

The concept of base isolation is gaining widespread acceptance in the global 
earthquake engineering community due to the excellent performance of base-isolated 
structures during the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes. Some of the 
commonly used isolation systems are elastomeric bearings including lead-rubber 
bearings (LRB) and high damping rubber (HDR) bearings as well as sliding isolation 
systems. In recent years, a few mathematical models of high damping elastomeric 
isolation bearings have been proposed. Hwang et al proposed a mathematical model 
modified from Pan and Yang’s model. The number of parameters used by Pan and Yang 
are reduced, and the model is extended to be capable of describing the Mullins 
effect and scragging effect of high damping rubber bearings.  
A mathematical model of high damping elastomeric isolation bearings proposed by 
Hwang et al has been validated by the cyclic loading test of HDR materials. In 
this work, this model will be validated using cyclic loading tests of HDR bearings. 
The comparison between the predicted and experimental results indicates the 
proposed model is capable of predicting the dynamic hysteretic behavior of HDR 
bearings under different axial loads and different excitation frequencies. In 
addition, this proposed model of HDR isolation bearings will be used to predict 
the seismic responses of a base-isolated multistory building tested by a shaking
