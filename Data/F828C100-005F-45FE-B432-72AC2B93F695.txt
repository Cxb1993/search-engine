speed-density relationship that gives rise to an 
exposition the triangular flow-density relationship 
proposed by Newell (1991) [8]: 
ckkifkvfq ≤= ),(  
cjam kkifkkcq ≥−= ),(  
where v is the free flow travel speed, c is the wave 
speed traveling in a direction against the traffic 
stream, kc is the critical density, and kjam is the jam 
density. 
 
 
2.1 Freeway Traffic Dynamics 
Consider a multiple lane (λ) freeway section with a 
single entry and exit ramps, as shown in Figure 1. It is 
assumed that at time slice n, traffic flow from 
upstream boundary enters a given section with flow 
rate of qu(n), and some traffic flow from entry ramp 
also enter the given section with flow rate r(n). Then, 
traffic flow discharges at the downstream boundary 
with flow rate of qd(n), and traffic flow diverts to the 
exit ramp with flow rate s(n). According to the law of 
conservation, the number of vehicles in this freeway 
segment at time n+1, Q(n+1) follows the relation in 
equation (1): 
))()()()(()()1( nsnrnqnqtnQnQ du −+−∆+=+ λλ         (1) 
Define vehicle concentration (section density) as 
k(n) = Q(n) / (λ∆x) where ∆x is length of the road  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
segment. Equation (1) can now be written in terms of 
density:                                         
λλ /)(/)( )()()(/()()1( nsnr nqnqxtnknk du−+ −∆∆+=+          (2) 
implicit flow-density relationship. We assume in this 
relationship between traffic flow and density is q = 
f(k), which is generally referred to as the fundamental 
diagram of traffic flow. If we substitute q = f(k) into 
equation (2), and define α = ∆t/∆x, we obtain:

With initial condition k(0) = k0 equation gives a 
complete description of the freeway flow process. 
Applying control system terminology, traffic density 
k(n) is called a state variable. Ramp metering rate r(n) 
is a control variable, and freeway boundary inflow qu 
is a disturbance input. 
 
 
2.2 Separated Connecting C-D Roadway 
Traffic Dynamics Sub-subsection  
It is assumed that the traffic flow of separated 
connecting C-D roadway conforms to LWR equation 
with appropriate flow-density relationship. Under 
this assumption, the traffic dynamics can be 
represented in discrete form:

a demand-capacity ramp metering control simulation 
equation to perform quasi-on-line training of the 
local ramp metering controllers. The model is based 
equation (3) with a fundamental diagram proposed by 
Greenshields (1934) [10]:

3.2  The Algorithm of Ramp Metering ontrol 
Model 
The details of this algorithm are described below: 
Step 1: Initialize r, r＇, k, k＇, g, and C. 
Step 2: Use equation (9) to obtain ramp /loop-ramp 
inflow r(n) and r’(n). 
Step 3: Get separated connecting C-D roadway and 
freeway inflow qu’(n) and qu(n), respectively, 
and calculate density k’(n+1) based on r’(n) 
and qu’(n). 
Step 4: Calculate the C0(n) and g(n). 
Step 5: Update according to (10) and set k’(n) = 
k’(n+1) and k(n) = k(n+1). If n-1 = N, stop. 
Otherwise, return to Step 2. 
 
 
4    Application of Ramp Metering 
Control Models 
To investigate the impact of ramp metering on the 
separated connecting C-D roadway traffic conditions, 
it was decided to apply in weekly alternation ramp 
metering and no control, respectively over the period 
from the morning rush hour 07:00 to 09:00. Total 120 
minutes on May 20, and November 22, 2002, and to 
perform subsequently a comparative evaluation of 
the corresponding traffic conditions.  
Ramp metering was applied only to one 
on-ramp and one on-loop-ramp at the separated 
connecting C-D roadway and freeway on Taipei 
junction. Note, however, that the highest inflows into 
the considered stretch of Taipei originated from the 
local arterials, and from the upstream of the end of 
the stretch, and all of them remained uncontrollable 
in this study. Under these conditions the 
controllability level of traffic flow in the Taipei 
junction via ramp metering is fairly limited. 
 
 
4.1 Demand-Capacity Metering 
Demand-capacity control features the selection of 
metering rates on the basis of a real-time comparison 
of dynamic upstream demand flow and downstream 
capacity. The dynamic upstream demand flow is 
measured in real time and compared with either a 
dynamic value of downstream capacity determined 
from a real-time value computed from the 
downstream flow and gap measurements. To be most 
effective, the downstream capacity used should 
account for the effects on capacity of weather 
conditions, traffic composition, and incidents. 
The difference between the dynamic upstream 
demand flow and the downstream capacity is then 
determined and used as the allowable entrance ramp 
demand flow. This ramp demand flow is expressed 
as a metering rate to be used during the next control 
interval (usually 1 minute). If the dynamic upstream 
demand flow is greater than the downstream capacity, 
a minimum metering rate is used. Of course, 
theoretically, if the dynamic upstream demand flow 
were greater than the downstream capacity, a zero 
metering rate, or ramp closure, should be used in 
order to prevent congestion [3]. 
 
 
4.2  Available Data and Numerical Case 
Study Results 
Parameters of this model are given in Table 1 [11,12]. 
The target densities are set as kd = 168.31 veh/km on 
freeway, and k’d = 75.75 veh/km on separated 
connecting C-D roadway. The traffic speed is chosen 
as vramp and vloop-ramp = 40 km/hr and capacity flow is 
qm = 1750 veh/hr/ln on the ramp and loop-ramp 
roadway. The minimum ramp metering rate is rmin = 
180 veh/h/r [13]. The outputs of this case are as 
follows: the optimal cycle time is 23 seconds, yellow 
time is 5 seconds, and green time on the loop-ramp 
and ramp signal are 14 seconds and 5 seconds, 
respectively. Other outputs of traffic flow variables 
are shown in the Table 2 and Fig. 2 and 3.
