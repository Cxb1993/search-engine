Abstract 
The study was to develop paclitaxel-loaded formulations using a novel type of 
self-assembled nanoparticles (P/NPs) composed of block copolymers synthesized by 
poly(γ-glutamic acid) and poly(lactide).  For the potential of targeting liver cancer cells, 
galactosamine was conjugated on the prepared nanoparticles (Gal-P/NPs).  In the in vitro 
studies, it was found that both the P/NPs and the Gal-P/NPs had a similar release profile of 
paclitaxel.  The activity in inhibiting the growth of HepG2 cells by the Gal-P/NPs was 
comparable to that of a clinically available paclitaxel formulation (Phyxol®), while the 
P/NPs displayed a significantly less activity (p < 0.05).  The biodistribution and anti-tumor 
efficacy of the prepared nanoparticles were studied in hepatoma-tumor-bearing nude mice.  
It was found that the groups injected with Phyxol®, the P/NPs or the Gal-P/NPs significantly 
delayed the tumor growth as compared to the control group injected with PBS (p < 0.05).  
Among all studied groups, the group injected with the Gal-P/NPs appeared to have the most 
significant efficacy in the reduction of the size of the tumor.  This is because a large number 
of the Gal-P/NPs were observed at the tumor site, and subsequently released their 
encapsulated paclitaxel to inhibit the growth of the tumor.  The aforementioned results 
indicated that the Gal-P/NPs prepared in the study had a specific interaction with the 
hepatoma tumor induced in nude mice via ligand-receptor recognition.  Therefore, the 
prepared Gal-P/NPs may be used as a potential drug delivery system for the targeted delivery 
to liver cancers.

galactosamine was conjugated on the P/NPs as a targeting moiety.  Hepatoma cells are 
known to recognize galactose- and N-acetylgalactosamine-terminated glycoproteins via the 
asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptors located on their surfaces [15]. 
 In this study, the distribution of the particle size, the zeta potential, the drug loading 
content and the drug loading efficiency of the prepared nanoparticles, and their release 
profile and cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells (a liver cancer cell line) were investigated in vitro.  
Additionally, biodistributions of the prepared nanoparticles were studied in vivo in normal 
mice and hepatoma-tumor-bearing nude mice.  The anti-tumor efficacy of the prepared 
nanoparticles in hepatoma-tumor-bearing nude mice was also examined.  A clinically 
available paclitaxel formulation was used as a control. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Materials 
Paclitaxel powder (purity > 99%) and clinical commercial paclitaxel [Phyxol®, 
contained 6 mg paclitaxel, 527 mg Cremaphor EL and 47.7% (v/v) alcohol per milliliter] 
were obtained from Sinphar Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Taipei, Taiwan).  PLA 
[poly(L-lactide), Mn: 10 kDa, with a polydispersity of 1.1 determined by the GPC analysis] 
was kindly supplied by the Biomedical Engineering Center, Industrial Technology Research 
Institute (Hsinchu, Taiwan).  Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO < 0.01% water), 
N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI, 98%), and dichloromethane were acquired from Fluka 
(Buchs, Switzerland). L-glutamic acid (purity > 99%), 
N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), 
galactosamine, and sodium cholate were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).  
4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 1,4-dioxane were obtained from ACROS (Janssen 
Pharmaceuticalaan, Belgium).  All other chemicals used were reagent grade. 
2.2. Synthesis of γ-PGA-PLA block copolymers 
γ-PGA was produced by Bacillus licheniformis (ATCC 9945, Bioresources Collection 
and Research Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan) and purified as per a method reported by Yoon et al.

a C18 analytic column (4.6 × 250 mm, particle size 5 μm, ThermoQuest, BDS, Runcorn, UK) 
[22].  Two mg of the freeze-dried P/NPs or Gal-P/NPs were dissolved in 1 ml 
dichloromethane under vigorous vortexing.  This solution was dried by evaporating 
dichloromethane in vacuum and then dissolved in a mixture of 50/50 (v/v) ethanol and 
deionized water for the HPLC analysis.  The flow rate of the mobile phase (60% 
acetonitrile and 40% deionized water by v/v), delivered by an HPLC pump (TCP, P-100, 
Riviera Beach, FL), was 1 ml/min at 30℃.  The injection volume was 40 μl and paclitaxel 
eluted from the column was monitored with an UV detector (Jasco 875-UV, Tokyo, Japan) at 
227 nm.  The drug loading content and loading efficiency of the P/NPs or the Gal-P/NPs 
were calculated using the equations listed below, respectively [23].

2.6. Release profiles of paclitaxel from the prepared nanoparticles   
The release profiles of paclitaxel from the P/NPs or the Gal-P/NPs were investigated in 
PBS at 37℃[22].  The freeze-dried NPs were weighed and resuspended in a centrifuge tube 
containing 20 ml PBS.  The tube was placed in a shaker water bath at 37℃.  At particular 
time intervals, the tube was taken out and centrifuged.  The supernatant was poured out, 
freeze-dried, and then dissolved in a mixture of 50/50 (v/v) ethanol and deionized water for 
the HPLC analysis.  The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml fresh PBS for continuous release 
measurements.  The paclitaxel released at each time point was calculated using a calibration 
curve [22]. 
2.7. Viability of HepG2 cells treated with distinct paclitaxel formulations 
HepG2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and were allowed to 
adhere overnight.  The growth medium was replaced with a fresh one containing varying 
concentrations (0.25-8 μg/ml) of distinct paclitaxel formulations investigated in the study: 
 8
nude mice were injected subcutaneously in the right flank with 0.1 ml of cell suspension 
containing 106 human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and allowed to grow to a mean volume of 50 
mm3 [11].  Animal care and use was performed in compliance with the "Guide for the Care 
and Use of Laboratory Animals" prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, 
National Research Council, and published by the National Academy Press, revised 1996. 
2.10. Biodistribution of the prepared nanoparticles 
In the study, rhodamine-123 was used as a model fluorescent probe that can be 
encapsulated in the hydrophobic core of the prepared NPs [6].  The prepared 
rhodamine-123-containing NPs in PBS were injected into the tail vein of normal or 
tumor-bearing mice at a dose of 10 mg/kg [24].  At different time intervals after injection, 
mice were sacrificed, blood was drawn, and various tissues such as the brain, liver, spleen, 
lung, kidney, and tumor were excised.  An aqueous solution (10 ml) containing deionized 
water and ethanol (50/50 by v/v) was added to each tissue, and the mixture was 
homogenized.  The mixtures were subsequently centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 min.  The 
supernatants were then lyophilized and resuspended in 1 ml deionized water.  Finally, the 
fluorescence intensities of the solutions were measured using a spectrofluorometer (F-2500, 
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 
520 nm [24]. The intensity of the autofluorescence from biological tissues was measured 
first, and then was subtracted from those of tissues with the rhodamine-123 loaded NPs. 
2.11. Anti-tumor efficacy of the prepared nanoparticles 
 The anti-tumor efficacy of distinct paclitaxel formulations against the subcutaneously 
implanted solid tumors induced by HepG2 cells in nude mice was evaluated.  Treatments 
were started when the tumors in nude mice reached a tumor volume of 50 mm3 and this day 
was designated day 0.  Mice were divided into four different groups [treated with PBS 
(control), Phyxol®, the P/NPs, or the Gal-P/NPs], consisting of four mice in each group.  
Distinct paclitaxel formulations were then injected via tail vein administration at a single 
dose of 20 mg paclitaxel/kg in PBS on days 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.  The size of the tumor and the 
change of body weight of each mouse were recorded [25,26]. 
 10
loading efficiency decreased remarkably (p < 0.05).  To obtain a comparatively high drug 
loading content concurrently with a high loading efficiency, the P/NPs prepared with a P/C 
ratio of 1/10 were used for the rest of the study.  The morphology of the prepared P/NPs 
examined by the AFM and TEM are shown in Figure 1.  As shown, the morphology of the 
prepared P/NPs was spherical in shape with a smooth surface. 
For the potential of targeting liver cancer cells, galactosamine was conjugated to the 
prepared P/NPs (the Gal-P/NPs).  After the conjugation with galactosamine, the AFM and 
TEM examinations showed that the morphology of the Gal-P/NPs stayed approximately the 
same.  As determined by the Morgan Elson assay, the amount of galactosamine conjugated 
on the P/NPs was 66.2 ± 2.4 nmole/mg Gal-P/NPs (n = 4). 
As shown in Table 1, the particle size of the Gal-P/NPs was comparable to that of the 
P/NPs (p > 0.05).  However, the zeta potential of the former was significantly lower than 
that of the latter (p < 0.05).  This is because galactosamine was conjugated to the carboxyl 
(–COO–) groups on γ-PGA (the hydrophilic shell of the P/NPs) and thus reduced the 
negative surface charge of the Gal-P/NPs.  The drug loading content and loading efficiency 
of the Gal-P/NPs were significantly lower than those of the P/NPs (p < 0.05).  This is 
because galactosamine was conjugated to the NPs after being loaded with paclitaxel.  
Apparently, a few loaded drugs were lost from the P/NPs during the process of the 
conjugation of galactosamine.  It was reported that vitamin E TPGS may be used as an 
emulsifier for the fabrication of polymeric NPs to significantly increase the loading content 
and loading efficiency of paclitaxel [28,29]. 
Hashida et al. reported that the majority of the diameter of the fenestrate of the liver 
sinusoid is usually smaller than 200 nm [30].  Thus, large particles hardly reach the liver’s 
parenchymal cells.  Additionally, drug carriers with a diameter larger than 200 nm are 
readily scavenged non-specifically by monocytes and the reticuloendothelial system (RES) 
[31].  It was reported that smaller particles tended to accumulate at the tumor sites because 
of the EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effect [32]; greater internalization was also 
observed [3]. 
 12
the polar spindle of cells and a characteristic condensation of cytoplasmic microtubules.  
Additionally, micronuclear formation, resulting from improper mitotic spindle assembly, was 
apparent. 
It was reported that paclitaxel readily enters mammalian cells and preferentially binds 
to tubulin in polymerized microtubules [33].  This stabilizes microtubules and greatly 
interferes with microtubular reorganization necessary, among other processed, for spindle 
formation and cell division [2].  Thus, exposure of susceptible cells to paclitaxel has been 
shown to initially cause arrest in the G2/M phase and finally to cell death through apoptotic 
mechanisms [34]. 
3.5. Biodistributions of the prepared nanoparticles in normal and nude mice 
 Biodistributions of the prepared nanoparticles in various organs in normal mice and 
hepatoma-tumor-bearing nude mice were evaluated at distinct durations after the injection of 
the Rh123/NPs or the Gal-Rh123/NPs.  For normal mice, the Rh123/NPs  were distributed 
mainly in the spleen (Figure 3a) due to the splenic filtration [23], whereas the amount of the 
Gal-Rh123/NPs observed in the spleen decreased significantly (p < 0.05, Figure 3b).  It was 
found that the Gal-Rh123/NPs were mainly accumulated in the liver. 
For hepatoma-tumor-bearing nude mice, similar observations were observed in the 
spleen and the liver for the groups injected with the Rh123/NPs (Figure 4a) or the 
Gal-Rh123/NPs (Figure 4b).  It should be noted that the amount of NPs observed at the 
tumor site for the group injected with the Gal-Rh123/NPs was significantly greater than that 
injected with the Rh123/NPs (p < 0.05). 
These observations were further confirmed by our CLSM inspection of the spleen, liver, 
and tumor sections retrieved from the mice injected with the Rh123/NPs or the 
Gal-Rh123/NPs (Figure 5).  For the group injected with the Rh123/NPs, the intensity of 
fluorescence observed in the spleen was much stronger than in the liver and the tumor site.  
In contrast, for the group injected with the Gal-Rh123/NPs, the intensities of fluorescence 
observed in the liver and the tumor site increased significantly. The aforementioned results 
indicated that the Gal-Rh123/NPs prepared in the study had a specific interaction with liver’s
