Chapter 1 Introduction 
 
The subproject 1 studies the reliable static output feedback controllers design for full-car 
active suspension systems with considering the possibility of sensors and actuators failures. 
Based on combining the concepts of simultaneous control approach, mixed ∞HLQG /  control 
approach, and regional pole placement approach, a novel method is proposed for designing a 
single static output feedback controller to achieve good suspension performance in all possible 
sensors and actuators failures. The LMI approach is not applicable for this problem since the 
admissible solution set is in general nonconvex. A barrier method is developed for solving this 
problem. 
The subproject 2 proposes an antilock braking system (ABS), in which unknown road 
characteristics are resolved by a road estimator. This estimator is based on the LuGre friction 
model with a road condition parameter, and can transmit a reference slip ratio to a slip ratio 
controller through a mapping function considering the effect of road characteristics, wheel 
angular velocity and slope angle. In the controller design, a direct adaptive fuzzy-neural 
controller (DAFC) for an ABS is developed. Finally, this paper gives simulation results of an 
ABS with the road estimator and the DAFC, and is shown to provide good effectiveness under 
varying road conditions. 
In subproject 4, an integrated headway adaptation (HA) with collision avoidance (CA) 
strategy is proposed to be associated with a human factor aspect for driving assistance. The 
maneuver in the CA strategy is developed based on the idea that warning or potential crash 
information generally can be graded such that the driver need not react to a discrete on/off 
warning. The control law for the HA strategy is designed by using a modified sliding surface to 
achieve driving comfort requirement and also stability in car-following. To simulate the speed 
controlling of human drivers, the throttle and brake actuation is directed by the regulation control 
which is designed based on a human reasoning approach. A description of an experimental 
vehicle and real traffic testing in highways and urban-like tracks shows the potential and

Chapter 2 Reliable Controller Design for Intelligent 
Active Suspension Systems of Advance Vehicles 
 
2.1 Introduction 
In this chapter, the design of reliable static output feedback controllers for full-car active 
suspension systems is studied. Vehicle suspension systems designing has been a hot research 
topic for a long time due to its important role in ride comfort and vehicle safety. It is known that 
there are conflicts between the vehicle ride and handling requirements in the classical passive 
design methods [2-8]. The conflict can be reduced by using active suspension systems technique. 
Therefore, many approaches have been presented to design controllers for active suspension 
systems. In [2-16], [2-19], and [2-20], the optimal control approaches are employed to design 1/4 
car, 1/2 car, and full car active suspension controllers. In [2-18], the full car active suspension 
systems’ controllers are designed by ∞H  control approach. And finally, in [2-11], the 
disturbance decoupling method is used to design 1/4 car, 1/2 car, and full-car active suspension 
systems. However, all these researches did not consider the possibility of sensors and actuators 
failures.  
It is known that the active safety of a vehicle highly depends on the reliability of its 
suspension system. The sensors and/or actuators of a active suspension systems may fail in some 
situations. Unnoticed sensors or actuators failures can lead to dangerous situations. For achieving 
active safety, the possibility of sensors and actuators failures must be taken into consideration.  
In this chapter, we consider the reliable static output feedback controllers design for full car 
active suspension systems with considering the possibility of sensors and actuators failures. 
Based on combining the concepts of simultaneous control approach (for overcoming the sensors 
or actuators failures), mixed ∞HLQG /  control approach (LQG method is for suppressing the 
suspension travel and ∞H  control is for reducing the forces acting on the passengers), and 
regional pole placement approach (for improving the transient response), a simultaneous mixed 
∞HLQG /  control with regional pole constraint approach is developed for the design of reliable

where 1C , 12D , and 1Cˆ  are provided in the Appendix. It is clear that the variable z∞  reflects 
the forces acting on the passengers and the variable LQz  reflects the suspension travel. Beside 
the concerns of force and suspension travel, it is desired that the suspension systems have good 
transient responses. The transient response of a suspension system heavily depends on the 
locations of its closed-loop poles. In this paper, the H ∞  control approach is employed to 
suppress the force acting on the passengers, the LQG optimal control approach is used to reduce 
the suspension travel, and the regional pole placement method is employed to improve the 
transient response. 
 
2.3 Main Results 
Since we consider the possibility of sensors and actuators failures, the considered suspension 
system has N possible dynamic models: 
  1 2ix Ax B w B u= + + , i=1,2,…,N                     (2.5)

LQz C x=  
2iy C x=  
That is,  
{ }2 2 21 21 2 2( , ) ( , ),..., ( , )N NB C B C B C∈ . 
The matrices 2iB  and 2iC , i=1,…,N, are obtained by adequately modifying the matrices B2 and 
2C . For examples, if the 9-th system is for describing the case that actuator 1 fails ( 1 0u = ), then 
29B  is identical to B2 except that the column 1 is zero; and if the third system is for describing 
that case that the sensor 2 fails ( 2 0y = ), then 23C  is identical to C2 except that the row 2 is zero.  
The main goal of this paper is to design a static output feedback controller for all the possible

The set 
1 1 1( ,..., , ,..., , ,..., )
f
N N NS α α μ μ γ γ  is called the admissible solutions set since for satisfying 
the requirements 1) and 2), the feedback gain F must lie in this set. Then, the considered problem 
to be solved can be re-formulated as:

As stated in [2-12] and [2-13], to solve the considered constrained optimization problem 
analytically is almost impossible since its minimal solution may not exist and its infimal solution 
is in general not a stationary point. Based on the barrier method (please see [2-7], [2-12], and 
[2-13]), we instead solve an auxiliary minimization problem to obtain an approximate solution of 
the original problem. The auxiliary cost function Jaux(F) is the sum of the actual cost function 
( )J F  and an additional weighted barrier function ( ) ( )pJ F J F∞+ , which will be defined below.

conditions for local optimum of Jaux(F). Then, we have the following result.

2.4 Illustrative Example 
Consider a suspension system shown in Fig. 2.1. Let the parameters of the considered 
suspension systems are: 960sm kg= , 1 2 3 4 18.31m m m m kg= = = = , 0.8r lt t m= = , 1.2fl m= , 
1.2rl m= , 1 2 3 4 10931.8 /k k k k N m= = = = , 2120I kg mθ = ⋅ , 2300I kg mφ = ⋅ , 
1 2 3 4 500 sec/c c c c N m= = = = ⋅ , and 1 2 3 4 183887 /t t t tk k k k N m= = = = . For simplification, here 
we consider only the case that one sensor or one actuator may fail at a time. However, we can in 
fact consider multiple sensors and actuators failures situations. We have the following possible 
cases: 
Case 1: Normal case (no sensors or actuators fail) 
Case 2: The sensor 1 fails ( 1( ) 0y t = ) 
Case 3: The sensor 2 fails ( 2 ( ) 0y t = ) 
Case 4: The sensor 3 fails ( 3 ( ) 0y t = ) 
Case 5: The sensor 4 fails ( 4 ( ) 0y t = ). 
Case 6: The sensor 5 fails ( 5 ( ) 0y t = ). 
Case 7: The sensor 6 fails ( 6 ( ) 0y t = ). 
Case 8: The sensor 7 fails ( 7 ( ) 0y t = ). 
Case 9: The actuator 1 fails ( 1( ) 0u t = ). 
Case 10: The actuator 2 fails ( 2 ( ) 0u t = ). 
Case 11: The actuator 3 fails ( 3( ) 0u t = ). 
Case 12: The actuator 4 fails ( 4 ( ) 0u t = ). 
Suppose the twelve possible dynamic models for the full car active suspension systems are 
described by: 
      1 2ix Ax B w B u= + + , i=1,…,12                      (2.35) 
                    1 12z C x D u∞ = +  
                   1ˆLQz C x=  
                   xCy i2=  
The objective is to design an output feedback controller u F y= ⋅  to minimal 
 16
considered. The considered problem cannot be solved via the LMI approach since its admissible 
solutions set is in general nonconvex. Based on the barrier method, we instead solve an auxiliary 
minimization problem to obtain approximate solutions. The necessary conditions for which the 
optimal solution of the auxiliary minimization problem must be satisfied have been derived.

Chapter 3 Intelligent Control for Anti-lock Braking 
Systems to Track Dynamic Optimal Slip Ratio 
 
3.1 Introduction 
An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a system on hydraulic vehicles which prevents the 
wheels from locking while braking. The purpose of this paper is to allow the driver to maintain 
steering control under heavy braking and in most situations to shorten braking times. However, 
the friction force on the locked wheel is usually considerably less as it slides on the road. 
Furthermore, while the wheel was locked, steering becomes impossible, leading to loss of control 
of the vehicle. For these reasons, anti-lock braking systems (ABS) [3-6], [3-7] have become one 
of the most common automotive technologies. The most important process parameters affecting 
the quality of control are the coefficient of friction between wheel and road surface, the wheel 
slip ratio and wheel angular velocity. The optimal wheel slip ratio for most road surfaces is 
between 0.1 and 0.3. Most ABS control strategies [3-3], [3-4] aim at maintaining the wheel slip 
ratio at 0.2. This value is a compromise between achieving a maximum friction force during 
braking, acceleration and vehicle steering. However, In general, optimal slip ratios are depended 
on the different road characteristics, such as the wet road or snow road. A tire/road friction 
estimator using only angular wheel velocity has been proposed to monitor the road characteristics 
[3-2]. In [3-2], a LuGre model [3-5], which effectively models tire/road friction based on the 
relative contact velocity, is used to form a tire/road friction estimator. In this paper, we will 
rewrite the LuGre tire/road estimator and consider the condition of slope angle. The LuGre 
tire/road estimator will be applied to estimate the road characteristics even if the slope angle 
changes. When we know road characteristics, the wheel angular velocity is only one can be 
measured of system. Moreover, the slope angle is known. Hence, the road characteristics, wheel 
angular velocity and slope angle can supply the reference slip ratio to an ABS controller through 
a mapping function. A feed-forward neural network [3-8] used a back-propagation learning 
algorithm is proposed to identify the mapping function from road characteristics to reference slip 
ratios. Hence, this ABS, based on the LuGre tire/road friction estimator, called LuGre-based ABS, 
can recognize the road characteristics and obtain a reference slip ratio from the mapping function.  
In traditional anti-lock braking systems, certain states, such as the wheel acceleration and the 
brake-line pressure, are difficult to obtain, or are prone to noise and other measurement errors. To 
resolve this problem, a state observer is required. Thus, an observer-based direct adaptive 
fuzzy-neural controller (DAFC) [3-1] is applied to ABS control, and its stability can be

3.2.2 Friction Model 
During the braking, when vehicle and road surface touch, the only part is wheel. The road 
friction models are usually described by steady-state maps of the wheel slip s , and the normalized 
friction force can be written as: 
x
z
F
Fμ =                                    (3.6) 
where xF  is longitudinal force, zF  is normal force. In previous research, a road characteristic 
θ  introduced into the LuGre friction model and the normalized friction force is shown as 
follows:

Dynamic friction models can be used to suitably describe the road-tire contact friction. One of 
these models is the LuGre friction model. Advantages of this model are that it can closely 
describe some of the physical phenomena found in road/tire friction, and that it has a parameter θ, 
directly related to road characteristics. By substituting equation (3.8) into (3.1) and (3.2) and 
adding viscous rotational friction ωδ , we can derive a one-wheel vehicle model with the LuGre 
friction model used in previous studies, called the LuGre-based ABS,

only the system output (the slip ratio), y λ= , is assumed to be measurable, and ( )f λ  is 
assumed to be unknown, the optimal control law (3.22) cannot be implemented. 
Thus, we suppose a control input u  is

where 
fu  is designed to approximate the optimal control law (3.23), and the control term svu  is

3.5 Overall Control System and Simulation Results 
Slip ratio control is a well-known method in ABS. In general, a given optimal slip ratio with 
respect to various road conditions is used as a reference signal. One main disadvantage of this 
method is the difficulty in getting the optimal slip ratio when the road conditions are unknown.  
Optimal slip ratios vary according to the individual road surfaces, the slope angle and 
difference wheel angular velocity. The ABS with the LuGre friction model (LuGre-based ABS) 
proposed in this paper can recognize the road condition and then supply the corresponding 
reference slip ratio to the vehicle system through a mapping function. To monitor the road 
situation in the LuGre-based ABS, it is only necessary to have the wheel angular velocity ω , 
which is easily measured by actual sensors. When the slope angle has different, the optimal slip 
ratio will be changed. Hence, we will use back-propagation learning algorithm to study the 
difference of slope angle, such as 30 , 20 , 10 ,0 ,10 ,20 ,30o o o o o o o− − − .The overall control system is 
shown in Fig. 3.3. 
The mapping function ˆ( , , )d Mλ α θ ω= is shown in Fig. 3.5. It maps the road condition 
parameterθ , the slope angle α  and wheel angular velocity ω  to the reference slip ratio dλ . 
Neural networks are well-known nonlinear approximators, especially for function approximation. 
Thus, to quickly and accurately learn the mapping function ˆ( , , )M α θ ω , we adopt FNNs as the 
learning mechanism. We will discuss the details of the FNN in the simulation examples.

3.6 Conclusion 
In this chapter, we design a new method to estimate, on-line, changes in slope road using 
only wheel rotational velocity information. This solves the traditional problem of slip ratio 
control when the road condition is unknown. The LuGre tire/road estimator is applied to estimate 
the road characteristics. If we know the road characteristics, the wheel angular velocity is the 
only signal we need to measure, and the slope road angle was known. We use a back-propagation 
learning algorithm to obtain a mapping function of the optimum slip ratio, when road surface 
conditions, slope angle and wheel angular velocities are known. In anti-lock braking systems, 
certain states are difficult to obtain by real physical sensors, or are prone to noise and other 
measurement errors. To resolve this problem, the observer-based direct adaptive fuzzy-neural 
controller (DAFC) is applied to ABS control, and its stability is guaranteed. The simulation 
results show that the road estimator effectively and quickly captures the road conditions, and the 
DAFC can force the output to track the reference slip ratio obtained by the road estimator.

Chapter 4 High-reliable Car-Following Control System 
Design  
 
4.1 Introduction 
Advanced electronic technology has brought the revolution into the development of 
intelligent transportation systems, and been applied to many diverse elements of the automobile. 
One way of change to driving is coming as the technology which is applied to collision avoidance 
along with driver interface designs and vehicle control systems. Studies have shown that driver 
errors are determined to be a definite and major factor for crash causes. Among multi-vehicle 
crashes, the rear-end type is the most common considered into the driver’s assists at present.  
Adaptive cruise control (ACC) and forward collision warning systems are two key 
technologies for the extension of the driver’s awareness and senses to correct inattention, bad 
following habits, and perceptual biases. Currently ACC systems [4-1]-[4-5] are being developed 
by enhancing cruise control with the ability to maintain a desired headway with respect to a 
forward vehicle which has been detected. During the safe headway adaptation by ACC systems, 
the human intervention is normally unnecessary. However, due to the comfort consideration in 
ACC systems [4-6], the limitation of speed changing would yield the non-effective braking for 
critical situations such as immediate collision. The operational limits should be clearly conveyed 
to the driver. Therefore, it will be essential to design a headway adaptation (HA) system that will 
cooperate or integrate with the collision avoidance (CA) strategy. Such an integrated system 
would not only adapt the speed of the vehicle but also advise the driver of a collision to avoid that 
the driver does not react to the collision in time. Consequently, this system design can be 
anticipated to achieve better driver acceptance and increased safety from the human factor 
perspective [4-5]. 
While the design in the HA/CA strategy is based on the vehicle kinematics, the design of the 
body-level (throttle /brake) controller requires the well-developed techniques against the 
challenge due to the complexity in the sub- components of vehicles. Even to different vehicles, a 
normal driver can be expected to drive well; this evidence motivates the application of human

also information integrated into driver’s decision, and will not result in excessive attention load to 
the human driver The vehicle longitudinal dynamics can be described by a set of system 
composed of various linear and nonlinear subsystems, namely engine, transmission, brake system, 
and rubber tires with respect to roads. Such a vehicle model is too complicated to be used for 
controller design. Therefore, it motivates an application of soft-computing technique, namely 
fuzzy control which allows a human reasoning method to design the human-like speed 
controlling into the regulation control. 
4.2.2 HA/CA Integration Design 
To enable the HA and CA strategy to work in collaboration, the supervisory control is developed

Fig. 4.3 Headway distance for car-following. 
Note that the warning distance (4.1) is also definition of anti-collision distance in ISO 15263 
which is specified to CA systems. As to the computation of the braking distance, the 
time-to-collision (TTC) braking distance is applied. The relative distance dr dynamics at any time 
t between two vehicles can be presented as 
0 0

τ τ= + − − + −∫ ∫            (4.2) 
where t0 denotes the time at which the measurement of TTC is required. 
When the time t > t0 and dr(t)=0, TTC can be obtained as Tc =t−t0. Since the computation of TTC 
requires the profiles of deceleration for both preceding and following vehicle, here the 
assumptions of the maximum deceleration for the preceding vehicle and zero deceleration for the 
following vehicle are made, i.e., max( )pa t a−= , ( ) 0fa t = . In addition, TTC can be viewed as the 
total delay which composes of the driver reaction time and the braking system actuation time, i.e., 
Tc =τtotal =τhum+τsys. The braking distance can then be determined by the initial distance dr(t0), and 
presented as

where vrel=vf −vp are the relative velocity at initial time t0 .

same maximum values, and vp is replaced by vrel , then the warning distance defined in (4.1) can

The resulted control law (4.11) can ensure that the eR → 0 without need of preceding vehicle 
information, and string stability is also maintained as long as choosing K>0 and σ > 2τlag [4-9]. In 
other words, the spacing error never amplifies in the car-following. The lag τlag mainly arises 
from the transport lag of sensors, the bandwidth of controller, and lag in actuators. The minimum 
value of time gap is 1 second as specified in ISO 15622, and this value can meet this requirement 
for typical value of τlag . In addition, the control gain K determines the rate of convergence of the 
spacing error eR .  
The conversion from the desired acceleration to the desired velocity is designed as

where gain kt > 0 is chosen to avoid fluctuation responses due to noise from the measurements of 
headway distance and vehicle speed.  
The desired acceleration/deceleration af_des is determined from the HA strategy as in (4.11) while 
the evaluate signal Iw > 1 which identifies the safe car-following. For the situation of Iw < 1, the

implies that the bake should be acted to decelerate. The error change in Ds can improve the 
controlling response for instant variance in vehicle speed. It should be noted that the normalized 
universe of discourse of the driving voltage is limited to the range [0, 1] and negative voltages 
(corresponding to negative values of u in Fig. 4.5(b)) can not provide inverse torques from the 
throttle motor. Therefore, the negative voltage can be output into the brake driver for active 
deceleration control. In other words, the SFLC is designed to provide a positive voltage with 
regard to acceleration for the throttle driver while provide a negative voltage with regard to 
deceleration for the brake motor. By using an inverse operation, the negative voltage can be 
inverted to the brake motor. Due to this nature of input voltage to motor drivers, the switch  
between the throttle and the brake control can be directly constructed. As a result, only the 
throttle will be acted if the requested speed is greater than the current speed; otherwise, only the 
brake will be acted whenever the vehicle is required to be decelerated (Ds < db). Thereby, the 
situation of both throttle and brake being active can be prevented. This approach is similar to the 
behavior of human drivers.

to green grade. In Fig. 4.7(c), the HA control was disable for only testing of the CA strategy. The 
graded display gave red alarm to indicate that it was under crucial warning for this speed and 
headway distance. 
High speed testing is conducted regularly in highway /expressway roads. The low speed 
experiments are conducted in urban roads and campus tracks. Results for a run on the campus 
tracks are presented in Fig. 4.8. The speed limit on the campus track is 25 km/h, and the time gap 
is set as 1 s for the low speed test. The blue line in velocity plot indicates the reference speed, the 
red line is the actual speed of the subject vehicle, and the green line is the driver-selected speed. 
The subject vehicle performed stop-to-go function with respect to a forward vehicle, and the 
range for stopping was maintained at 4 m (additional gap L given in the HA strategy) throughout 
the experiment.

4.6 Conclusion 
In this chapter, the approach to integration of the HA and the CA strategy is presented. With 
the assistance of the warning graded display, the driver can be clearly informed whether the 
car-following by system controlled or manual operation is safe. Due to the comfort consideration 
into the HA control, the emergency braking is overridden by the CA strategy which prioritizes the 
maximum deceleration to the subject vehicle. In addition, the human driver is warned for the 
awareness of imminent crash and be able to apply the more urgent brake.  
By consisting of the supervisory control and the regulation control with a hierarchical 
structure, the stability of car-following can be ensured while the throttle/brake can be controlled 
in such a way of human reasoning without need of the detailed complex vehicle model. The 
integrated HA/CA system is implemented on the real vehicle, namely Taiwan iTS-1, and has been 
tested in real traffic phase, both at highway speeds and in stop-to-go situations.

Chapter 5 Robust Stability Analysis of a Fuzzy Vehicle 
Lateral Control System Using Describing Function 
Method 
 
5.1 Introduction 
It is well known that the describing function is an useful frequency domain method for analyzing 
the stability of a nonlinear control system especially when the system has hard nonlinear elements, 
such as relay, deadzone, saturation, backlash, hysteresis and so on. The fundamental description 
of describing functions can be referred in [5-1-5-3]. Some academic and industry researches have 
been applied the describing function to meet the design specifications. For PI controller design, 
an iterative procedure for achieving gain and phase margin specifications has been presented in 
[5-4] based on two relay tests and describing function analysis. In [5-5], the describing function 
utilized for the stability analysis and limit cycle prediction of nonlinear control systems has been 
developed. The hysteresis describing function was applied to the class AD audio amplifier for 
modeling the inverter [5-6]. Ackermann and Bunte [5-7] employed the describing function to 
predict the limit cycles in the parameter plane of velocity and road tire friction coefficient. The 
algorithm computes the limit cycles for a wide class of uncertain nonlinear systems was 
considered in [5-8]. As for the intelligent control, some researchers have developed the 
experimental and analytic describing functions of fuzzy controller in order to analyze the stability 
of fuzzy control systems [5-9-5-11]. Besides, the describing function was also applied to find the 
bounds for the neural network parameters to have a stable system response and generate limit 
cycles [5-12]. In fact, the uncertainties are often existed in the practical control systems. It is well 
known that the frequency domain algorithms of parameter plane and parameter space [5-13, 5-14] 
have been applied to fulfill the robust stability of an interval polynomial.  
In this chapter, we apply the describing function of fuzzy controller mentioned in [5-11] and 
parameter plane method [5-14] to consider the robust stability of a vehicle lateral control system 
with perturbed parameters. A systematic procedure is proposed to solve this problem. The
