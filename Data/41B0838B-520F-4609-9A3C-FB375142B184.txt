inversion method. Commercial polyimide (Alfa
Aesar) was dissolved in dichloromethane
(Mallinckrodt) and the concentration of
polymer solution was 18wt%. The polymer
solution cast on the glass plate by 600μm
thickness and solidification in ambient. Then,
the polyimide membrane was put in the oven
with 250o C and vacuum condition for 24hr. All
the membranes were between 70-100μm thick.
There are two pyrolysis conditions, one is
vacuum atmosphere, and another is nitrogen
atmosphere with 200sccm flow rate. The
furnace was purchased from Tender Scientific
Co., Ltd. The pyrolysis procedures carry out as
shown in Fig 1. The carbonization temperature
set in 550oC or 700oC, and the holding time
was 2 hrs at carbonization temperature. After
the pyrolysis process, the membranes were
cooled slowly in the furnace to room
temperature naturally. The carbon membrane
was stored in the desiccator with vacuum
condition.

The morphology of carbon membranes was
observed by digital camera and Hitachi
S-3000N SEM. The weight loss during
carbonization process was determined using
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA
testing was preformed using a Perkin-Elmer
TGA 7 with a 20 cm3/min flow rates N2
atmosphere. The analysis was carried out at
temperatures ranging from 50 to 900oC with 5
oC/min temperature increasing rate. The
prepared polyimide membranes and carbon
membranes were characterized with
FTIR-ATR (Perkin Elmer, Miracle-Dou
FTIR-ATR) to identify the degree of
carbonization. A Panalytical wide-angle X-ray
diffractometer (X΄Pert Pro(MRD) PW3040/60)
was performed to measure the ordered
dimension and interchain spacing of
membranes at room temperature.
A gas permeation analyzer (Yanaco
GTR10) was used to measure the pure gas
permeability coefficients (P) for the polymeric
membranes and carbon molecular sieve
membranes to O2, N2. The ideal selectivity
was calculated based on the ratio of
permeability coefficients:
2222
//O NON PP (1)
where PA and PB are the permeability
coefficient of pure gases A and B, respectively.
A microbalance (Cahn model D202
microbalance) was used to determine the
solubility coefficient (S). The permeability
coefficient can be written as the product of the
diffusion coefficient and the solubility
coefficient:
SDP  (2)
The diffusion coefficient was determined with
the following relationship:

The pure gas separation results were shown
as Table 1. The O2 permeability of polyimide
membrane is 1.84 barrer and the selectivity if
O2/N2 is 5.58. However, the O2 permeability
increased to 198.04 barrer and the selectivity of
O2/N2 slightly decreased to 4.96 for the 550oC
pyrolysis carbon molecular sieve membrane. It
is well known that high temperature pyrolysis
of polymeric precusor leads to evolve small
molecules and the permeability increasing
being dependent on pore formation. Owing to
N550 carbon molecular sieve membrane has
more polymeric fraction than V550 the
permeability of N550 was slightly lower than
V550. As pyrolysis temperature increased to
700oC, polymer chains degrade near
completely, the pore in carbon molecular sieve
membrane shrink into smaller size. It’s clear
observed that the d-spacing was decrease when
the temperature increased, and the permeability
of V700 became 50.48 barrer. Furthermore, the
permeability and selectivity of N700 became
56.33 barrer and 12.32, respectively.

Table 2 investigated the effect of pyrolysis
conditions on O2 and N2 solubility of carbon
molecular sieve membranes. One can see that
alter pyrolysis environment only litter changes
are in the solubility. More significant changes
occur in high temperature indicate that the
sorption site of V700 is more than V550. The
