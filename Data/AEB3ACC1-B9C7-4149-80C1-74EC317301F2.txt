stability of the flow.
PROBLEM FORMULATION: GOVERNING EQUATIONS
Consider a dilute electrolyte solution between two infinite
parallel plates separated by a distance 2d. A Cartesian
coordinate system is defined as shown in Fig.1. A diffuse
double layer exists near each boundary due to a potential  on
each plate. An axial AC electric field is applied and the fluid
will move due to the electric body force, producing an
electroosmotic flow. Joule heating due to a combination of
current in the fluid and ion transport produces energy that is
removed by holding the wall temperature constant. We are
particularly interested in the coupling between the temperature
field and the flow through a temperature dependent dynamic
viscosity , so we take all other physical properties to be
constant and consider a linear relationship between  and
absolute temperature T,
)](1[0 wTT  , (1)
where 0 is a reference dynamic viscosity at wall
temperature wT , and  a constant depending on the fluid.
The basic equations are developed in [11] and will not be
repeated here. They are augmented by a thermal energy
equation containing Joule heating as an energy source. These

LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS
The governing equations and boundary conditions are
linearized about the basic state solution, and the disturbances
are decomposed into normal modes as
]exp[),(),,,( zikxiktyCtzyxC zxjj  , (42)
with similar expressions for , u, pand . It noted
that the linear stability equations can be decoupled into two
stability problems, one is the electrokinetic problem and the
other is the Stokes layer problem. According to the results of
[11] for the constant viscosity case, the electrokinetic problem
is less stable than the Stokes layer problem. Thus, we study the
electrokinetic problem first to search for the possibility of
instability. The small disturbance equations for the
electrokinetic problem are

effect of Joule heating on the electrokinetic problem is indirect
and through the base state velocity ),( tyU B . The solution
technique is identical to that in [11]. A Galerkin approximation
method is used to expand the concentration and electrical
potential disturbances in trial functions and inner products are
used to reduce the problem to a coupled set of ODE’s in time 
with periodic coefficients. The system is integrated numerically
using the Bulirsch-Stoer method with adaptive time-stepping
[14] to obtain the corresponding transition matrix. The Floquet
exponents are calculated by integrating the system over one
time period, and the system stability is determined by the
largest Floquet exponent r , with 0r indicating
instability.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The basic solutions ),( tyU B and ),( tyB are fairly
simply related to the parameters B, St and Pr, while the stability
analysis involves more parameters including St, Pr, Re, 0, B,
and jSc with 1j , 2. A table for typical values of St, Re,
0 and jSc has been given in [11] for channels that are 50 –
200 m thick, binary 1-1 electrolytes at millmolar
concentrations, and a few kilovolts/centimeter electric field
strength with 10-50 Hz modulation frequencies. Here we fix
10Pr and 7501 Sc , 4922 Sc corresponding
approximately to an aqueous solution of sodium and chloride
ions at KT 298 . The other parameters are allowed to vary in
the ranges 101.0 St , 20Re0  , and 500100 0 
for finite B. These ranges are wide enough to include most
microfluidic applications. In the numerical work we choose the
parameter 1B to consider the variable viscosity effect. This
does not contradict the assumption that B is a small parameter
in the analysis of basic flow. Since we may consider the leading
Floquet exponent r to be a function of B and to have a
Taylor series expansion about 0B , there will be a linear
relationship between r and B. The choice 1B allows a
simple determination of the second term in the series, giving
the sign and magnitude of the effect of variable viscosity. In the
following sections, we give the stability results first, and then
interpret the stability mechanisms from the variations of the
temperature and velocity base state profiles.

B. MECHANISM OF STABILIZATION
Since the variable viscosity arises from the Joule heating
effect on temperature, we first consider the variation of
temperature profile with time. It is found that the base
temperature solution depends on TSt and t as indicated in Eq.
(36). Figure 5 (a)-(i) show base state temperature profiles for
three typical cases 1TSt , 10, and 100 with 0t , 4/ ,
2/ and 4/3 . Here we re-write Eq. (36) as

For the case 1TSt , Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) show the components
of t2cos and t2sin , respectively; their combination, together
with the quasi-steady solution, is shown in Fig. 5 (c), where the
solid line is the quasi-steady solution. Clearly, both components
t2cos and t2sin have nearly the same order of magnitude and
the total variation of the temperature is reasonable large. The
temperature in the middle of channel is always higher than that
on the wall, which means the fluid in the middle region always
has lower viscosity than the fluid adjacent to the wall. These
viscosity variations lead to a change in the velocity profiles, as
discussed below. The case 10TSt is shown in Fig. 5 (d)-(f):
both t2cos and t2sin decrease rapidly with increasing TSt ,
with the variation near the middle of channel due mainly to the
component t2sin . For 100TSt , as shown in Fig. 5 (g)-(i),
both t2cos and t2sin approach zero and the temperature
profile is dominated by the quasi-steady solution, i.e. the time-
modulated effect of temperature almost produces no influence
on the temperature profile for high thermal Stokes numbers. As
a consequence the viscosity will not vary with time t, and BU
will be that appropriate to constant temperature. These facts
alone explain why there is no B dependence of r for large
St, as shown in Fig. 2.

It remains to explain the stabilization for small St and
variable viscosity, which relies on the details of BU . For the
