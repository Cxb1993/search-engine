Abstract 
This study recruited ten young participants to test their maximum symmetric and 
asymmetric isoinertial lifting capabilities from floor to the knuckle height using 
different container dimensions varied in both width and length. The results showed 
that the order from the highest to lowest lifting capability for the lifting modes was 
symmetric lifting, asymmetric lifting with leg rotation and asymmetric lifting with 
trunk rotation, and for the container dimensions was 50 x 35 x 15 cm, 70 x 35 x 15 
cm and 50 x 50 x 15 cm. Participants’ lifting capabilities differed significantly (p < 
0.05) among lifting modes and container dimensions. This study recommends that 
asymmetric lifting with leg rotation should be encouraged as compared with 
asymmetric lifting with trunk rotation when performing heavy asymmetric lifting 
tasks. 
 
intra-abdominal pressure, erector spinae activity, shear and compression spine loading, 
local stress concentration, and greater precipitation injury potential (Kumar 1980, 
Kumar 1984, Marras and Sommerich 1991, Granata and Marras 1993). Though 
human maximum asymmetric lifting capabilities in terms of isometric and 
psychophysical forms have been widely reported (Warwick et al. 1980, Garg and 
Badger 1986, Garg and Banaag 1988, Kumar and Garand 1992), human maximum 
asymmetric isoinertial lifting capabilities was seldom examined. Additionally, 
previous studies examining human asymmetrical lifting capability conventionally 
asked participants to keep their feet parallel to the sagittal plane and lift the load with 
rotated trunk (referred to as asymmetric lifting with trunk rotation in this study), and 
neglected the strategy of lifting the load symmetrically, then turn direction mainly 
with footstep change and place the load onto the destination height (referred to as 
asymmetric lifting with leg rotation in this study) for accomplishing the asymmetric 
lifting tasks. This strategy of asymmetric lifting with leg rotation justifies the 
necessity of exploring the information of human maximum asymmetric lifting 
capability with leg rotation.  
 
The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of symmetric lifting, 
asymmetric lifting with trunk rotation, and asymmetric lifting with leg rotation on 
human maximum isoinertial lifting capabilities. Further objective was to examine the 
effects of container dimension on human maximum isoinertial lifting capability. The 
null hypotheses of this study were human maximum isoinertial lifting capability 
differed in different lifting modes and container dimension. 
 
 
2. Method 
 
2.1 Participants 
Ten young male participants volunteered for this experiment. All participants 
plane) dimensions. The dimensions (length*width*height) for the three containers 
were 50 x 35 x 15 cm, 70 x 35 x 15 cm and 50 x 50 x 15 cm. All three containers 
were provided with secure wooden handles (diameter 3.5 cm) on the upper middle 
half of the container’s width sides.

2.3 Experimental procedure 
Each participant was briefed the purpose of this study before the experiment. The 
participant wore ordinary clothing and flat-soled sport shoes during the experiment. 
The participant was asked to stretch himself for at least 3 minutes prior to the 
experiment. Then, the participant was randomly assigned a lifting condition from all 
nine (three modes x three containers) possible lifting conditions. The initial weight 
inside the container was loaded with some lead shots in a random and balanced way. 
The participant was asked to lift the container from the floor onto a 74 cm high table 
with semi-squat lifting technique. The participant was permitted to take one or two 
steps as needed for body stability while lifting the container onto the table. If the 
participant succeeded the lifting task, he was asked to increase the weight by adding 
more lead shots, in increments of 2 to 10 kg, and tried again until he could not 
succeed the lifting task. Initial load increments were large but were reduced as the 
participant approached his maximum isoinertial lifting capability. At least 2 minutes 
of rest was provided for the participant between two consecutive progressive trials, 
eliminating the effect of fatigue on maximum isoinertial lifting capability. No any 
motivational factors were provided to the participant. Two assistants were by the 
participant’s sides for preventing the participant from possible dropping of the 
container or loss of body stability. The participant’s maximum isoinertial lifting 
capability can normally be obtained after approximately five to seven tries. At most 
three maximum isoinertial lifting capabilities were tested for each participant in a day. 
Before the formal experiment, the participant was given a 2-week period to 
significantly decreased human maximum lifting capability as compared with 
symmetric lifting. Participants lifted 7.2 % and 16.1 % less weight when lifting 
asymmetrically with trunk rotation and with leg rotation, respectively, as compared to 
symmetric lifting. The decrease in maximum asymmetric lifting capability can be 
attributed to the fact that a greater directional change in the applied force, more 
muscular strain, and poorer posture and stability. In asymmetric lifting, the applied 
force is likely to include a lateral component to move the load from the origin to the 
destination, and a horizontal force to pull the load close to the body, as well as the 
obvious vertical force (Garg and Badger, 1986). Additional body movement and 
greater displacement of the container in asymmetric lifting might also be responsible 
for the lower maximum lifting capability. 
 
This study demonstrated asymmetric lifting with leg rotation obtained 
significantly higher maximum lifting capability as compared with asymmetric lifting 
with trunk rotation. Participants’ initial posture for asymmetric lifting with leg 
rotation was similar to that for symmetric lifting. Apparently, asymmetric lifting with 
leg rotation provides a biomechanical advantage over asymmetric lifting with trunk 
rotation, because the trunk is required to twist less, providing more stability to the 
body during the lifting. The main shortcoming for asymmetric lifting with leg rotation 
is that more body movement is required during lifting, potentially limiting maximum 
lifting capability. This more body movement during lifting might account for the 7.2 
% decrement in lifting capability from symmetric lifting. Due to the fact that 
asymmetric lifting with leg rotation could obtain a higher lifting capability as 
compared with asymmetric lifting with trunk rotation, this study recommends that 
asymmetric lifting with leg rotation should be recommended from the viewpoint of 
biomechancis when it is unavoidable for a heavy asymmetric lifting. 
 
Container width or length significantly affected human maximum isoinertial 
Additionally, lifting mode and container dimension significantly affected human 
maximum isoinertial lifting capability. The results of this study can enhance the 
understanding of the human maximum isoinertial lifting capability; however, these 
reported lifting capability data cannot be used as the upper load limit for workplace 
practice since lifting a load at the maximum human capability is very hazardous to the 
musculoskeletal system and easily results in loss of human stability while lifting.
