（二） 計畫英文摘要。 
Cooperative communication attracts lots of concerns recently for the intelligent resource- sharing among the 
mobile users equipped with single antenna to exploit the spatial diversity. For the user which acts as source 
node, its cooperating partners serve as relay nodes to provide alternative transmission paths and form a virtual 
antenna array in order to enhance the signal reception at the destination with well coordination. In the past, the 
optimization of cooperative strategies is mostly based on the idealized assumption that the instantaneous 
channel state information (CSI) is known perfectly at the relays or the coordination information has an 
unlimited length. Based on the above assumption, transmit beamforming is the optimal precoding strategy to 
maximize receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the multiple-relay cooperative networks. In the project, we 
consider a practical distributed beamforming scenario with limited feedback information. More specifically, 
based on the instantaneous CSI, the destination chooses the best codeword as the beamforming coefficients 
among the relays from a codebook with limited size, and transmits the codeword index to the relays through 
the feedback channel. The codebook is constructed recursively offline using General Lloyd Algorithm(GLA). 
Assume that the channel is time-varying, we can model the state of codeword usage as a finite-state Markov 
chain. When the channel variation is slow, the transition probabilities can be further exploited to compress the 
feedback information. Therefore, by taking advantage of the temporal correlation of the time-varying channel, 
it either demands less resource on the feedback message, or allows constructing a codebook with bigger size 
and smaller quantization errors.

codeword is a set of beamforming coefficients applied at the relays. The size of a codebook is limited by 
the amount of feedback bits send by the destination. When the channels change, the destination selects a set 
of codewords as the beamforming coefficients which maximize the received SNR and feeds the index back 
to the relays to accomplish the transmit beamforming. Moreover, we consider the time-varying channels 
and model the channel states as a first-order finite-state Markov chain, called channel state Markov 
chain[8]. Using the property of transition probabilities matrices, two methods are proposed to compress the 
feedback message which are as follows. 
1) Fixed compression: Given current state, discard the states with low transition probabilities and 
re-index the remaining states with reduced bits. 
2) Huffman coding: Encode the index of each states with various number of bits using Huffman 
coding. 
Utilizing these two methods improved the number of feedback bits can be reduced, and the spectral 
efficiency can be effectively improved. 
 
 
System Model 
 
Consider a cooperative system with one source node, $L$ relay nodes and one destination node as 
shown in Figure 1. We assume that there is no direct link between source and destination due to severe path 
loss effect, and all nodes are half-duplex. The relay nodes adopt the AF protocol by retransmitting a scaled 
version of transmit signals. Cooperative transmission takes two phases. In Phase I, source transmits a 
symbol $x$ with unit power E[jxj2] = 1. The received signal at the relay node ` is 
 y` =
p
Psf`x + w`; ` = 1; 2; :::; L; 
where Ps is the average power used at the source, f` is the channel coefficient between source and the 
`-th relay node, and w` is the AWGN at the relay `, which is modeled as a zero-mean circularly 
symmetric Gaussian random variable with variance N0. Without loss of generality, all channels suffer 
Rayleigh fading independently, namely f` » CN (0; ¾2f`).

In (3), the optimal SNR is a summation of the SNRs of all source-relay-destination links with AF relays, 
and is equivalent to the SNR of the case that all relays forward signal with power Pr over orthogonal 
channels and the destination adopts MRC. In practice, it takes large overhead for relays to obtain 
instantaneous CSI globally. In the case that only the destination has full CSI, the optimal beamforming 
coefficients in (2) are manipulated at the destination. To allow relays to adopt beamforming, the 
beamforming coefficients can be sent by the destination through feedback channel. If the data symbols are 
modulated by BPSK, the bit error rate (BER) can be written as P = Q(
p
2°opt): 
 
 
Codebook Design 
 
In previous section, the optimal beamforming vectors can be obtained when the instantaneous 
channel coefficients are perfectly known at relay nodes. However, if each relay node only has partial CSI 
as considered in this thesis, relay nodes can simply or only utilize the limited bits fed back by the 
destination to accomplish transmit beamforming. The messages fed back to relays indicates one codeword 
in a codebook, and each codeword represents a selected beamforming vector. The codebook is constructed 
off-line. The size of codebook is bounded by the number of feedback bits. In this chapter, we want to 
design optimal codebooks according to the statistical channel states and the number of feedback bits. 
 
To design of optimal codebooks has been studied to apply transmit beamforming in MISO [9][10] or 
MIMO [12] systems. The optimal codebook is obtained numerically. For instance, Grassmannian line 
packing method [13] provides the optimal codebook in terms of maximum average received SNR which 
improves the performance of symbol error rate. In the content of AF cooperative networks, the codebooks 
generated from Generalized Lloyd Algorithm (GLA) had been proved better than those generated from the 
Grassmannian line packing method [14]. Therefore, we use GLA [6] to design our optimal codebooks in 
this project. 
 
Assume that the destination transmits a B-bit message to inform the relays the values of 
beamforming coefficients. Mathematically speaking, destination first maps current channel states into a 
state Di, i 2 f1; 2; : : : ; 2Bg and transmit the index "i" to all relays. That is, the space spanned by all 
 9
variance which corresponds to a representative vector of a subspace. Different from regular vector 
quantization, the representative vector of a subspace does not belong to the space to be partitioned. Let 
f = [f1; f2; : : : ; fL] and g = [g1; g2; : : : ; gL] are one of realization of the channel states. We defined (u; g) 
belongs to the i-th subspace Di, if

H
j qj2
1 + bHj ©©
Hbj
; 8j 6= i; (4) 
where q and © are functions of (f ;g) defined in previous section respectively. In other words, the 
destination selects one codeword from the codebook to maximize the received SNR according to the 
current channel state and feeds the index of the codeword back to relay nodes. From the destination, if the 
codeword bi is the one that maximizes the received SNR under current channel state, then we define the 
channel state (f ;g) belonging in the i-th state Di, (i = 1; 2; : : : ; 2B). The flowchart of GLA is illustrated 
in Figure 2. 
 
 
Compression of Feedback Messages in Time-Varying Channels 
 
In this section, we consider that all the channels are slowly time-varying. The time-varying channels 
can be modeled as a first-order Gaussian-Markov random process. The Gaussian-Markov models of the 
link between source and the `-th relay and the link between the `-th relay and destination can be 
expressed as 
f`(t + 1) = ½f`(t) +
p
1¡ ½2wf`(t + 1);
g`(t + 1) = ½g`(t) +
p
1¡ ½2wg`(t + 1); 
where ½ 2 [0; 1] is an autocorrelation coefficient of time-varying channels, wf`(t) and wg`(t) are the 
white Gaussian random with power spectral density ¾2f` and ¾
2
g`
, respectively. The correlation between 
each channel state f`(t) (or g`(t)) at some instant and that at the last instant f`(t¡ 1) (or g`(t¡ 1)) 
equals to the same constant ½, i.e., 
 E[f¤` (t¡ 1)f`(t)] = E[g¤` (t¡ 1)g`(t)] = ½; 8`: 
If the channels vary slowly, the value of ½ is very close to 1. On the contrary, if the channels vary quickly, 
the value of ½ approaches to 0 Under the assumption that the value of ½ is very close to 1, it is highly 
possible that the codewords which serves as the beamforming coefficients to maximize the received SNR 
at two consecutive instants are the same. In other words, the channel states of two consecutive instants are 
very likely to belong the same subspace corresponding to some codeword. We classify all channel states 
into finite number of states. Due to time-varying property of channels, it is not difficult to verify that the 
channel state sequence can be modeled as a first-order finite-state Markov chain. This Markov chain is 
called the channel state Markov chain [8]. In the t-th time slot, we define that the channel state (f(t); g(t)) 
belongs to the state Sj, i.e., (f(t); g(t)) 2 Sj , if (f(t); g(t)) is in the subspace Dj, and Pij is the 
transition probability from state Sj to state Si, i.e., 
 Pij = Pf(f(t + 1);g(t + 1)) 2 Sij(f(t);g(t)) 2 Sjg: 
Let P be a 2B £ 2B transition probability matrix with [P]ij = Pij. It can be observed that the diagonal 
elements of P are the largest in each column. It indicates that it is highly possible to keep in the same state

Huffman coding is $2.4625$. Figure 3(b) illustrates the simulation results for 4-relay network with 
compressed feedback, limited feedback and unlimited feedback. The number of bits compressed by using 
fixed compression method is 4, and the average number of bits compressed by Huffman coding is 4.6926. 
For the beamforming with finite feedback, the system used Huffman coding to compress the feedback bits 
provides the best performance. The system used fixed compression method attains nearly the same 
performance as that the system used Huffman coding. Both are better than the case without compressing 
the feedback bits. As seen from this figure, the performance used our compression methods are very close 
to the optimal scheme (B = 1).

        compression for the slowly time-varying channel with (a) L=2, (b) L=4 
 
Figure 4 demonstrates the BER performance with L=2 and autocorrelation coefficient ½ = 0:95. 
Comparing Figure 4 with Figure (3)a, we find the performance of networks with ½ = 0:95 are worse than 
½ = 0:99. This is intuitively clear, as the value of ½ is very close to 1, the BER performance is better. In 
this case, the number of bits compressed by using fixed compression method is 2, and the average number 
of bits compressed by Huffman coding is 3.1447.

results, it shows that, with proper number of tracing symbols,
the proposed scheme has satisfactory detection performance
compared with the Mao & Wu scheme [5] which requires
perfect CSI. In addition, symbol error rate of the resulting
system performs closely to the case where the misbehavior of
the relay is perfectly known at the destination.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a three-terminal cooperative network, as shown in
Fig.1, where one user acts as a source, and a cooperating part-
ner which serves as a relay to assist the source’s transmission
toward the destination. The cooperative transmission is accom-
plished in two phases. During Phase I, the source transmits a
block of M data symbols xs = [xs[1], xs[2], · · · , xs[M ]]T to
the destination, where each symbol is modulated by quadrature
phase-shift keying (QPSK) with unit energy. Due to broad-
casting nature of wireless medium, the relay can overhear the
source signal as well. The signals received at the relay and
destination are respectively given by
yr[m] =
√
Pshsrxs[m] + wr[m] (1)
yd,1[m] =
√
Pshsdxs[m] + wd,1[m] (2)
where Ps is transmission power of the source, hsr and hrd
are channel coefficients of the source-relay link and source-
destination link respectively, and wr[m] and wd,1[m] are addi-
tive white Gaussian noises (AWGNs) occurred respectively at
the relay and the destination during Phase I. In this work, we
assume that all channels are quasi-static Rayleigh faded, and
the coherence time is much greater than a block period. The
noise components wr[m] and wd,1[m] are circularly symmetric
and Gaussian distributed with zero mean and variances σ2r and
σ2d, respectively. To perform detection of malicious relay, a
sequence of T tracing symbols have been inserted into the
block of data symbols xs. The values and locations of tracing
symbols are in a pseudorandom manner, and assumed known
at the destination. The tracing symbols are also utilized for
channel estimations in our work.
During Phase II, the relay forwards symbols xr =
[xr[1], xr[2], · · · , xr[M ]]T and the signal received at the des-
tination is then given by
yd,2[m] =
√
Prhrdxr[m] + wd,2[m] (3)
where Pr is the transmission power of the relay, hrd is the
channel coefficient of the relay-destination link, and wd,2[m]
is complex white Gaussian noise with variance σ2w.
In this work, we adopt repetition-based decode-and-forward
(DF) relaying scheme. That is, after receiving signal during
Phase I, the relay proceeds to decode the source message. The
source message is assumed to be decoded successfully, if the
channel quality of the source-relay link is sufficiently reliable
such that log2(1+Ps|hsr|2/σ2r)≥R, where R in bits/channel-
use is the transmission rate of source messages. Otherwise, an
outage occurs at the relay, and the relay remains silent during
Phase II, i.e., xr[m] = 0. If the relay successfully decodes
source messages and conforms the DF cooperative strategy, it
regenerates the source symbols and transmits xr[m] = xs[m]
during Phase II. Here, combining yd2 [m] with yd,1[m] by
maximal ratio combining (MRC) is beneficial to increase
received signal to noise ratio (SNR). In contrast, if the relay
behaves maliciously, it deliberately garbles the source symbols
as randomly generated ones. To be more specifically, symbols
transmitted by the relay can be modeled as
xr[m] = θ[m]xs[m], (4)
where θ[m] is an ergodic random variable with distribution
depending on the misbehaving pattern of the relay [7], [8].
In this work, we consider the worst misbehaving pattern,
i.e., {θ[m]} are i.i.d. random variables with probability mass
function (PMF)
Pr
{
θ[m] = e
jnpi

}

, n = 0, 1, 2, 3.
The distribution of θ[m] is assumed available at the destination
based on the record of misbehavior detections [10]. If this is
the case, combining the received signal yd,2[m] with yd,1[m]
is harmful to the signal demodulation at the destiation.
III. DETECTION OF MISBEHAVING RELAY
After receiving signals in both phases, the destination pro-
ceeds to demodulate the source symbols by combining two
received signals. In this work, we consider that the relay may
misbehave with a certain probability, and instantaneous CSI is
not available at the destination. As the block diagram illustrat-
ed in Fig.2, the destination has to estimate channel coefficients
of the relay-destination and source-destination links as well as
determine current status of the relay before performing MRC
and demodulation. Moreover, the silence or misbehavior of
the relay leads to disastrous channel estimation of the relay-
destination link since the tracing symbols are not transmitted
or are replaced with incorrect ones. An ideal misbehavior
detection shall be performed in the absence of instantaneous
channel coefficients. If the relay remains silent due to outage
events or deliberately misbehaves, the signal transmitted by
the relay does not convey any source information. Thus, it is
not necessary to estimate the channel coefficients of the relay-
destination link and to combine two received signal at the
destination. In such case, the signal received in Phase II will
be discarded, and the destination demodulates source symbols
simply from the signal received through direct link. On the
other hand, if the relay is cooperative, the channel coefficient
of the relay-destination link is then estimated in order to take
MRC at the destination.

Fig. 3. Constellation of the normalized received signals at SNR=10dB given

jpi/4
of tracing symbols is T = 20, and the distributions of Nmax
under the two cases are distinguishable. Thus, the maximum
number of the received signal points serves as a favorable
measure to determine the relaying behavior. Assume that the
priori probability that the relay node behaves cooperatively or
maliciously is known at the destination, which can be achieved
through the record of the relay behavior [10]. Based on the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, the relay is detected
as behaving cooperatively if
Pr{Nmax|malicious}Pr{malicious} (8)
≤ Pr{Nmax|cooperative}Pr{cooperative}.
Otherwise, the relay node is detected as a malicious one.
The decision rule can be reduced to detect the relay as a
cooperative partner if
Nmax ≥ ρth,
where ρth is a predetermined threshold which satisfies (8).

computer simulations. In the considered cooperative systems,
the channel coefficients, hsr, hrd and hsr, are i.i.d. com-
plex Gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit variance.
The noise variances at all receivers are normalized to one.
Transmission powers of the source and the relay are assumed
equal, i.e., Ps = Pr , SNR. The priori probability that the
relay misbehaves is Pmal = 0.1 and perfectly known at the
destination.
To focus our discussions on the probability of detection
errors, it is assumed that the source-relay link is error-free
in simulations of Fig.5 and Fig.6. In Fig.5, we demonstrate
probabilities of detection error of the proposed scheme using
various numbers of tracing symbols T = 10, 20, 50, and 100.
It shows that the detection error probability decreases with
SNR slowly when T is small. However, the misbehavior
detection has great improvement when T is increased to fifty.
When T exceeds 50, increasing the value of T leads to
limited benefit to the detection error probability. In Fig.6, we
compare detection error probability of the proposed scheme
with existing misbehavior detection proposed by Mao & Wu
[5] when T equals to 20 or 50. In the Mao & Wu scheme,
the destination determines the relay behavior according to
the correlation between the demodulated tracing symbols and
their exact values. Note that the existing scheme requires
instantaneous CSI, which is assumed perfectly known in our
simulation. It is clear that Mao & Wu scheme outperforms the
proposed one since perfect CSI is exploited. It also shows that
the performance gap between two schemes is less than 3 dB
if T =50 tracing symbols are employed.
The SER of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Fig.7.
In the computer simulation, the source symbols are modulated
using QPSK, and the transmission of the source-relay link is
assumed in outage if the channel capacity is less than R=2
bits/channel-use. The length of each block equals to M=100
symbols, and T = 20 tracing symbols are inserted randomly
into each block. The proposed scheme is compared with
four various cases: (a) Direct transmission, (b) No malicious
detection, (c) Genie-aided case, (d) Fully cooperation. In
