extracellular polymer of some bacteria and in many other
organisms.1–3 Chitin and its derivatives, including polysac-
charides, oligosaccharides, and monosaccharides, are impor-
tant biological materials4–6 and have been shown to play a
role in plant organogenesis and invertebrate embryogenesis.4
The addition of chitin to soil can increase the population of
chitinolytic bacteria. Such stimuli can thereby reduce the
infection of fungal plant pathogens and plant parasitic nem-
atodes.7–10 Chitin oligosaccharides (also called N-acetyl-
chitooligosaccharides) have also been shown to enhance
immune system function11–13 and induce tumoricidal activ-
ity.14–16 More over, the antimicrobial activities and the cho-
lesterol reduction function of chitin oligosaccharides have
also been demonstrated.17,18 In fact, it was found that the bi-
ological activities of chitin and its derivatives depend on
their chain length and solubility.19 Recently, hexameric chi-
tin oligosaccharide (referred to in this article as ‘‘hexamers’’)
with potent biomedical actions has been reported.16,20–22
Chitin derivatives can be produced by chemical cleavage
or by enzymatic degradation with chitinases. In industrial
applications, enzymatic degradation is preferred, as it can
generate more homogeneous oligosaccharides with higher
molecular weights.23 However, applications have been re-
stricted by the fact that the enzymatic products contain only
a small proportion of potentially bioactive hexamers,24,25 and
also by the instability and limited activity of the enzyme.
Chitinases are found in numerous organisms, such as
viruses, bacteria, higher plants, and animals.3 In organisms
with endogenous chitin, usually in the form of an exoskele-
ton, chitinases are produced for the morphogenesis of cell
walls and exoskeletons26 and their activities need to be care-
fully regulated.27 Organisms that do not synthesize chitin
endogenously may produce chitinases primarily for providing
carbon and nitrogen as nutrients or for other biological func-
tions.28,29 In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the enzymatic deg-
radation of chitin is similar. The ﬁrst step consists of the
random hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds between GlcNAc
residues by endochitinases (EC 3.2.1.14), which yields
oligomers. This is followed by further hydrolysis to mono-
mer by digestion from the nonreducing end by b-N–acetyl-
hexosaminidase, an exochitinase (EC 3.2.1.52). In some
organisms, chitobiosidases (EC 3.2.1.30) release GlcNAc
dimers from the nonreducing end between these two steps to
facilitate chitin degradation.3,30–32 Recently, a large number
of chitin-hydrolyzing enzymes have been identiﬁed in eukar-
yotes and bacteria and only a few, including Chi70 from
Thermococcus chitonophagus33 and chitinase from Aspergil-
lus fumigatus, are denaturation resistant.34
In this report, we have isolated and identiﬁed two new chi-
tinases derived from Aeromonas schubertii. These chitinases
are sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant (SDSR) and able to gen-
erate a major hexasaccharide product from chitin. Here, we
also introduce an in-gel chitinase assay, which is shown
simultaneously to measure chitinase activity and locates it in
the gel. Another sensitive method, with colloidal chitin-azure
as the substrate for chitinase activity, was also used.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Crab chitin imported from Vietnam was purchased from a
local market. Growth media for microorganisms were pur-
chased from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). Sephadex
G-100, DEAE-Sepharose, and Mono-Q columns were ob-
tained from Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech Asia Paciﬁc (Hong
Kong, China), and other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO). Colloidal chitin and colloidal chitin azure
were prepared from powdered forms.35 Glycol chitin for the
chitinase assay was prepared as previously described.36
Isolation of chitinase-secreting microorganisms
Agar medium containing 0.2% colloidal chitin was used
as a selective plate for isolation of chitinase-secreting micro-
organisms in soil as described previously.35 Colonies with
surrounding clear zones were selected and grown in 100 mL
of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with or without 2% chitin
powder at 28C for 3 days, and the chitinase activity
released into the medium was monitored during growth.
Puriﬁcation, amino acid sequence determination, and
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) peptide
sequencing of chitinases
A single colony of the selected microorganism showing chi-
tinase activity was preinoculated into BSH1 medium (0.07%
K2HPO4, 0.03% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4, 0.03% peptone, and
0.03% yeast extract) containing 2% glucose and grown at
37C overnight, and then the bacteria were transferred to chi-
tin medium (BSH1 medium containing 2% chitin powder) and
incubated for 3 days at 28C for chitinase induction. One liter
of culture supernatant was then harvested and ammonium sul-
fate slowly added to 90% saturation. After centrifugation, the
pellet was dialyzed and redissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.45 (Buffer A). Small molecules and pigments were removed
by gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex G-100 column in Buffer A,
and then fractions with chitinase activity were applied to a
DEAE-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear 0–0.5 M
NaCl gradient in Buffer A. The chitinase-containing fractions
were further puriﬁed by FPLC using a Mono-Q column. The
absorbance at 280 nm was used to estimate the concentration
of proteins eluted from columns, whereas quantiﬁcation of
pure proteins was performed using a Pierce BCA protein assay
kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard.37
The chitinases with or without partial digestion with tryp-
sin were subjected to SDS-PAGE38 and electroblotted onto a
PVDF membrane using a semidry blotting system as
described previously.39 The blot was stained with 0.1% Coo-
massie Brilliant Blue R250 in 50% methanol/10% acetic
acid and destained, and then the protein/peptide bands were
excised and their N-terminal amino acid sequences deter-
mined using a 476A sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA).39 For sequence tag,40 proteins digested com-
pletely with trypsin39 were applied to an ESI Q-TOF I mass
spectrometer (Micromass, England).
Mass spectrometry
Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of ﬂight
mass (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis was performed in positive
ion mode on a Voyager DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSep-
tive Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with a
337 nm nitrogen laser and delayed extraction. Analyses were
carried out in linear mode at a mass range of m/z 1500–
75,000 with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a delay
time of 300 ns. The instrument was externally calibrated
with bradykinin, apomyoglobin, and bovine serum albumin.

their molecular weights remained unchanged (FigureF5 5), sug-
gesting that the proteins were monomeric and lacked inter-
molecular disulﬁde bonds. The molecular weights were
further determined by MALDI-TOF, which gave a peak at
53,527 for ASCHI53 and at 61,202 for ASCHI61 (FigureF6 6).
The N-terminal sequences and internal sequences obtained
are shown in TableT3 3. A database search with Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)33,48 and MS/MS peptide
sequencing of the two chitinases after complete trypsin
digestion49,50 were performed, and both indicated that these
two proteins were novel.
Enzymatic digestion of chitin with ASCHI53 and
ASCHI61 resulted in the formation of hexameric oligosac-
charide. This was demonstrated by the presence of the [M þ
H]þ ion at m/z 1074.41 in the MALDI-TOF spectrum, which
indicates a hexamer of chitin oligosaccharides. Our results
suggested that ASCHI53 and ASCHI61 are endochitinases
and conﬁrmed the previous observation that these bacteria
produce more than one chitinase.51 The most biomedically
active of the chitin oligosaccharides, hexamer, could be
obtained by digestion of chitin with either of the two
enzymes.
SDSR chitinase activity of ASCHI53 and ASCHI61
SDS was added to test the stability of ASCHI53 and
ASCHI61 in the presence of detergent. In 5% SDS,
ASCHI53 retained 65% of its chitinase activity, whereas
ASCHI61 retained 75%; in contrast, the chitinase activity of
lysozyme was completely lost under the same conditions
(Figure F77A). These results were conﬁrmed using the in-gel
chitinase assay. Figures 7B,C show that the chitinase activity
of lysozyme was inhibited by 0.1% SDS, but gradually
recovered after the SDS was removed by incubation of the
gel in 1% Triton X-100, whereas SDS had no effect on the
chitinase activity of ASCHI53 and ASCHI61. These results
show that these enzymes are resistant to SDS. ASCHI53 and
ASCHI61 also retained their activities in the presence of
10% 2-mercaptoethanol (Figures 7B,C), suggesting that the
disulﬁde bonds in these protein molecules are not associated
with their chitinolytic activity.

The traditional in-gel chitinase assay uses 4-Mu-
(GlcNAc)1-3,
57 glycol chitin,44 or CM-chitin-RBV32 as sub-
strate and requires that one polyacrylamide gel, containing
SDS, is stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for
protein localization. In a parallel experiment, another gel
without SDS, is treated with Calcoﬂour white M2R, and
chitinase activity is detected under UV light.43,54,58 In con-
trast, our method using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for
gel staining allowed both the protein bands and the chitino-
lytic clear zones to be monitored simultaneously, as both the
glycol-chitin and protein possess a partial positive charge
under the staining condition. The sensitivity of the assay
allowed us to detect as little as 107 units of chitinase (data
not shown). Usually, chitinase activity is assayed using col-
loidal chitin or glycol chitin as substrate2,43 and the reducing
sugar formed by chitinase digestion is quantiﬁed, but inter-
ference can occur due to the presence of reducing sugar in
the medium. To overcome this problem, substrates labeled
with 4-methylumbelliferyl were recently introduced for ﬂuo-
rometric assay.2 Using the new colloid chitin azure method,
the free form of azure released after enzymatic digestion
can be measured directly by UV–visible spectrophotometry,
without interference from reducing sugar or the pH of
the reaction solution. This detection method is sensitive
and cost-effective and chitinase activity can be easily
determined.
Using these improved techniques, we demonstrated that,
in solution, the endochitinase activity of ASCHI53 and
ASCHI61 was not affected by the presence of 10% 2-mer-
captoethanol and that more than 60% of the activity was
retained in the presence of 5% SDS, while, on glycol chitin
gels, activity was seen in the presence of 0.1% SDS. These
results suggest that the enzymes have rigid structures and are
therefore SDS-resistant. In fact, not only chitinases from A.
schubertii appear to be stable and resistant to b-mercaptoeth-
anol, chitinases from Serratia marcesens and Chromobacte-
rium spp also harbor the similar characteristics.59–61 In
addition, an SDSR chitinase was also isolated from A. fumi-
gatus YJ-407 and it lost 20% enzyme activity in 0.1%
SDS.33
The apparent molecular weights of ASCHI53 and
ASCHI61 estimated by SDS-PAGE were, respectively, 12
kDa and 6 kDa lower than those determined by MALDI-
TOF. This is probably due to the fact that the concentration
of 0.1% SDS used in SDS-PAGE is probably too low to
unfold the rigid structures of these two chitinases. The stabil-
ity of the two endochitinases from Aeromonas schubertii
may make them useful for industrial applications. Recently,
chitinases have been extensively used in biomedical and
ecological applications, and ASCHI53 and ASCHI61 are
currently being developed for such applications.
