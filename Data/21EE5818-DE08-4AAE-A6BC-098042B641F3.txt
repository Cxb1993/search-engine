 1. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the researches and methods regarding green product design are advanced 
dramatically. Currently, in order to conform to the environmental protection regulation, most 
green design happens at the remanufacturing stage. It makes green design becomes difficult 
due to original design constraints, e.g., structure, material and function, etc. Therefore, 
product designers need to consider environmental impacts and conduct green analysis in the 
initial stage of life-cycle design. It cannot only guarantee the initial product structural and 
functional design to conform environmental regulations but also benefit to the subsequent 
product maintenance, disassembly and upgrade to improve product recycling, reusing and 
remanufacturing. 
Modular design plays an important role in green product design [1-10]. Among them, 
artificial intelligence methods are extensively applied on the modular design because it can 
quickly find global-optimal or near-optimal solutions based on its randomness and high 
degree of freedom [4-10]. For example, genetic algorithms can utilize the characteristics of 
the modules to design different genetic operators to find near-optimal or global-optimal 
solutions.  
Most methods using genetic algorithms have the same problems of when increasing the 
complexity of the products not only increase the computational time but also increase the 
opportunity of trapping in the local-optimal solutions.

charged electrons. One atom contains positively and negatively charged objects, and if the 
valence number between them is the same is called electro neutral.  
Between each pair of atoms, there exists a bounding relationship. It is just like the 
connecting relationship between modules in a product, and the whole product is composed by 
several connected modules. In this paper, the atomic theory is applied to the modular design 
for green product design to facilitate the follow-up product upgrading, maintenance or 
assembly. There are some connecting relationships between each component in a product. 
Usually, the more neighboring components a component touches, the more important it is, 
and has a higher complexity than other components. Therefore, in this paper, we define the 
components with more neighboring components as the positively charged atomic nucleus and 
the other neighboring components are define as negatively charged electrons. For example, in 
Figure 1, P4 is an atomic nucleus, and P1, P2, P3, P5, and P6 are the electrons. In a product, 
there are several positively charged atomic nuclei and negatively charged electrons that 
surround the atomic nucleus. The modules in a product are just like atoms; between modules 
have some bonding to connect them together in a product.

added in the Coulomb’s law, as shown in Equation 2, to let the attractive force be a positive 
force between two electric charges, and the repulsive force is negative. Thus, if > 0, 
F < 0; and if  < 0, F > 0. In addition, if two components connect together, the 
distance r between the two components is set to 1. If the components are not connected 
together, the distance r between them is set to 2. 
3. MODULAR DESIGN 
In this section, some definitions will be introduced.

Table 1.Touch Matrix 
 Since component 3 has the most touched components, component 3 is used as the 
positively charged atomic nucleus with a valence of positive four (+4). The other components 
are then regarded as negatively charged electron and each has a valence of negative one (-1).

3.2. Adding Constraints in the Touch Matrix 
Product designers can also add green design constraints into the touch matrix, e.g., 
which components are recyclable, reusable, or remanufacturable…etc. Product design 
engineers can utilize green constraints to amend the original touch matrix to form different 
types of green modules. The original module can be compared with the revised green 
modules to get product redesign suggestions. The details of adding green constraints will be 
described in section 4.

Table 3.Attractive Matrix 
3.4. The force sets of components 
The force set of component i is defined as FSi:(n, Q, F).,where n is the number of the 
maximum attractive force between component i and other components; Q is the maximum 
attractive force between component i and other components; E is the total force on 
component i.  
From the attractive matrix, the force set for each component can be easily calculated.  
The Force Sets: 
FS1: (1, +4, 3) 
FS2: (1, +4, 3) 
FS3: (4, +4, 11.75) 
FS4: (1, +4, 1.25) 
FS5: (0, 0, -2) 
FS6: (1, +4, 3) 
After the force sets are obtained, the product modules can be formed by grouping the 
components with the same Q values together. For example, the force sets of the product in

Table 5. Green Matrix 
After we got the green matrix, we can consider it as a new touch matrix and use the 
same method to find the attractive matrix and the force sets of components to form green 
design modules. The attractive matrix is shown in Table 6. 
 
 
Table 6.Attractive Matrix by adding recycle constrains 
 
The force sets are FS1: (1, +4, 3), FS2: (1, +4, 3), FS3: (3, +4, 11.5), FS4: (1, +1, -0.75), FS5: 
(0, 0, -2), and FS6: (1, +4, 3). 
Therefore, the result of green modules are [1, 2, 3, 6], [4] and [5]. Components 4 and 5

5.1. Touch Matrix 
The product designers can decide the number of positively charged atomic nuclei based 
on the requirement of modules. If more positively charged atomic nuclei are assigned, more 
modules will be formed.  
In this case study, components having at least three touched relationships will be 
selected to carry positively charged atomic nuclei, so there are six positively charged atomic 
nuclei, which are Part 1, Part 2, Part 5, Part 6, Part 10 and Part 14, and the rest components 
will be assigned to negatively charged electrons. The touch matrix is shown in Table 7.

5.3. Attractive Matrix 
From Table 7, we can see that Part 1, Part 2, Part 5, Part 6, Part 10 and Part 14 are 
positively charged atomic nuclei and the rest components are negatively charged electrons 
which has a valence of one of negative electricity.

For =+4, we have  
Part 2= (3,+4,-34),Part 21= (1,+4,11.25),Part 22= (1,+4,11.25) 
For =(+4)*2, we have 
Part 3= (1,+8,14.25),Part 6= (3,+8,-60),Part 19=(1,+8,14.25),Part 20=(1,+8,14.25)

5.5. Atomic groups and modular design  
    In this section, the relationship between atomic groups and modular design will be 
discussed. We can see that there exist touch relationships between two adjacent modules. The 
touch relationships maybe any types of connections by any connectors. Here, when there is 
only one touch relationship between two adjacent modules, we define this situation to be the 
best condition of modular design. If the module has only one connective relationship with the 
other module, the disassembly time and disassembly difficulty will be reduced in the 
disassembly process. Therefore, an atom will meet the best condition of modular design if the 
number of the positive charged atomic nucleon subtract all negatively charged electrons is 
equal to one, and we define this situation as “full loading”. If the module has more than a 
valence of one of positive electricity, it infers that this module has more than one touched 
relationships with the other adjacent module, and the module is called “non-full loading”. In 
this case study, parts 5, 6 and 14 are full loading, and parts 10, 2 and 1 are non-full loading.  
In all non-full loading atoms, if the total number of components in any two modules is 
equal to the positive charged atomic nuclei in one of the module, we can keep that atomic 
nuclei and combine the two modules together by changing the other atomic nuclei to be a 
negative charged electron. If we make the non-full loading modules to become full loading, 
the products will have less number of modules and will have simpler connections between 
each module. Thus, the product will become greener due to the reduced disassembly time.

5.6. Green product design 
In this case study, if the lamp tube is designed to be recycled, it needs to be easily 
removed. In addition, the assembly time and the assembly difficulty also need to be reduced. 
Here, mode 2 is chosen to add green constraints, based on the product requirements. The 
product designers can compare the difference between the original modules and the green 
modules and consider greenness in the initial stage of the product life-cycle, as shown in 
Table 11.

Table 11.The original module and the green module 
Since part 3 (light) needs to be recycled, it can be an individual module in the green 
module, and [6, 19, 20] can be another module. For module [6, 19, 20], the two screws can be 
eliminated to let part 3 (light) be quickly replaced.  
The lampshade has to be removed quickly, so [1, 2, 4, 21, 22] can be redesign to be one

1. Purpose 
I was invited to present a paper at the IASTED Human-Computer 
Interaction Conference in Innsbruck, Austria. The topic of my presentation 
was “Using Immersive Virtual Environments for Realistic Life-Size Fire 
Safety Training for Children.” 
 
2. Process 
The Human-Computer Interaction Conference was held by the 
International Association of Science and Technology for Development 
(IASTED). This conference was held in conjunction with other three 
conferences (Web-based Education, Internet and Multimedia Systems and 
Applications, Visual Communications). The acceptation rate of the HCI 
conference was 50%. There were about 200 people attended the 
conferences totally. The conference site was at the Congress Innsbruck, 
which is located in the beautiful downtown area.  
I served as the session chair for session 1 on March 17. I also 
presented my paper at the session which I chaired. The session topic was 
“Applications in education”. My presentation mainly focused on the 
effectiveness of using immersive virtual reality on fire safety training, as 
Shown in Figure 1. The research showed that Users enjoyed the VR 
experience. Children liked VR-based training over the traditional training 
methods. Younger children reported more fright when using the VR-based 
fire safety training application. My presentation had received many 
interests, discussions, and responses from the audience.  
Other sessions of the conference included “Augmented and virtual 
realities”, “Modes of interaction”, “Understanding users”, “Design and 
evaluation”. “Visualization”, “Interaction on the move”, and “Collaboration 
and communicating.” The conference also included a tutorial presentation 
(“Design patterns for user interfaces on mobile equipment”) and a keynote
