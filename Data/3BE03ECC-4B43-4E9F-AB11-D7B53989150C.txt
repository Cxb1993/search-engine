1. The system is isothermal and under steady state.
2. The gas phase is an ideal gas mixture and insoluble in
the liquid phase.
3. The porosity varies linearly across the GDL.
4. The catalyst layer is infinitely thin and can be treated
as a boundary where electrochemical reaction occurs.

above assumptions, the continuity equation for the mixture
in the GDL can be written as

non-uniform porosity is used to examine the transport
characteristics of liquid water and oxygen across the
cathode GDL. The effects of non-uniform porosity on the
liquid water saturation are shown in Fig. 1 for several
different gradients of porosity under current density
2/1 cmAI  . The porosity 1 on the side adjacent to the
catalyst layer is fixed at 0.2 and the porosity 0 on the
other side adjacent to the gas channel varies from 0.2 to 0.8.
Obviously, the liquid water saturation decreases gradually
with higher 0 , which is in agreement with the
experimental evidences [11-13] that an addition of MPL
will benefit the removal rate of liquid water and thus
enhance the cell performance accordingly. The
corresponding profiles for the transport of oxygen across

6to the presence of a MPL. The developed theoretical model
provides a simple way to estimate the effects of MPL on
the profiles of liquid water saturation and oxygen
concentration across the GDL. It is found that the content
of liquid water in the GDL is quite sensitive to the
non-uniformity of porosity and the utilization of MPL
indeed can reduce the mean liquid water saturation of the
GDL. Besides, the negative effect of MPL on oxygen
transport will reduce greatly for a larger porosity on the
side of GDL adjacent to the gas channel. The permeability
also plays an important role on the transport of liquid water
and a higher permeability is beneficial to reduce the liquid
water saturation of GDL, while its influence on the oxygen
transport is less significant. The contact angle c which
indicates the hydrophobic property of GDL also produces a
similar effect as permeability on the transports of liquid
water and oxygen gas. The present model will be extended
further to examine the effects of non-uniform porosity on
the i-V curve which represents the fuel cell performance.
