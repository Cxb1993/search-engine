1. Introduction 
In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communications over mobile wireless channels, 
after initial time and frequency acquisition, fine frequency offset and time variation of the channel state will 
continue to exist due to Doppler shift, instability of local oscillators, and multipath fading and hence must be 
continuously or frequently tracked [1]. To perform fine frequency tracking and channel estimation, the most 
widely adopted technique is the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm. Usually, one OFDM symbol 
block is used as the training data. When using the ML technique to track frequency offset, one needs to have 
the channel knowledge. Likewise, to perform ML channel estimation, frequency offset estimation must be 
given. Therefore, to track both fine frequency offset and the channel state, a popular method is to alternately 
estimate the frequency offset and channel state by adaptive iterations. In the literature, there exist many 
proposed ML algorithms of joint frequency tracking and channel estimation for both linear modulation and 
OFDM systems [2]-[6]. A major difficulty is the local extrema or multiple solution complication arising from 
the highly nonlinear nature of the multi-dimensional log-likelihood function. As a result, some schemes of 
simplification or approximation are often used to help solve the problem [5], [6]. In addition, complex 
algorithms must usually be accompanied to aid the tedious search of the global solution [2]-[6]. How well 
such algorithms are designed will greatly affect the global solution convergence performance. When the initial 
frequency offset is large (close to half the subcarrier spacing), it usually becomes rather difficult to achieve 
global solution convergence. Carefully observing the simulation results of most of the cited works above, we 
can perceive that, when the initial frequency offset exceeds 1.0  of the subcarrier spacing, the mean square 
errors (MSEs) or variances of both the frequency and channel estimators given in these works start to depart 
away from the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is increased. Thus their tracking 
ranges are well below half or 5.0  of the subcarrier spacing. This is due to the less accurate results arising 
from the approximations and/or simplifications when initial frequency offset values become large. In [1], by 
using the linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) combiner to optimally combine frequency offset 
estimators based on single time slot pilot samples from a received time-domain OFDM block, they 
successfully circumvent the multiple solution difficulty and meanwhile achieve very satisfactory joint 
estimation performance with wide tracking range (up to half the subcarrier spacing). Moreover, in [1], the 
estimator MSE will not depart away from the CRB at large SNRs. However, their algorithm still requires the 
lengthy adaptive iteration process due to joint estimations. Since, as stated earlier, it is necessary to 
continuously or frequently perform tracking of frequency and channel state, the lengthy adaptive iteration 
process, which is time-consuming, should be highly undesirable. 
  In this paper, rather than using the ML technique, we apply the method of least squares (LS) to perform fine 
frequency tracking utilizing repeated OFDM training blocks. Our LS formulation for frequency offset 
estimation will not require channel knowledge. Then, based on the frequency offset estimator thus obtained, 
channel estimation is readily performed. This way, not only the multiple solution complication due to 
nonlinearity of the log-likelihood function can be avoided, but also the need for lengthy adaptive iterations is 
obviated. Thus the entire process becomes much simpler and faster. Most important, our estimator 
performance outperforms those of the existing ML techniques. However, it is to be noted that the advantages 
and superiority of our technique are achieved at the expense of data transfer rate reduction due to the use of 
repeated training blocks. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the signal and system model. Section 3 delineates our 
LS formulation for frequency tracking. Section 4 addresses the channel estimation techniques after frequency 
offset correction. Section 5 analyzes our estimation performances. Then, Section 6 presents simulation results. 
Performance comparisons will be made between our LS algorithm and the usual ML algorithms based on 
single training block. Finally, Section 7 draws conclusions.  
 
2. Signal and system model 
Consider OFDM communications over mobile wireless channels. Assume time and frequency acquisitions 
have been completed. Due to Doppler shift, instability of the oscillators, and multipath fading, fine frequency 
offset and time variation of the channel state will continue to exist. Let nx , nh , and nw  respectively 
represent the discrete-time baseband data sample, channel impulse response (CIR), and noise sample at the

where )Re(  and )Im(  respectively denote the real and imaginary part. It is apparent that the range of ˆ  
given by (11) is 5.0  or half the subcarrier spacing, and it has no multiple solution problem, requires no 
channel knowledge and only takes a one step computation process without adaptive iterations. However, these 
advantages are not without cost. The price paid is that the estimator of (11) requires the use of more than one 
OFDM training blocks. This results in a reduction of system throughput or data transfer rate. 
   It is to be noted that (11) is based on the premise that fading remains unchanged over at least 1L  
OFDM blocks. In other words, we have assumed slow quasi-static fading. This implies that the maximum 
Doppler frequency must satisfy Tcff cM /1/   corresponding to a mobile speed )/( Tfc c , where c 
is the speed of light, T is one OFDM block length in seconds, and cf  is the carrier frequency in Hz. Taking 
an 802.11a standard with 5cf GHz and 5.312/1  Tf kHz, this requires 500,67 km/hr. 
Apparently, this requirement for slow quasi-static fading is easily met in practice. For example, if 
60 km/hr, then TfM /10
3  which is one thousandth of an OFDM block, it is thus reasonable to assume 
fading to remain unchanged over several hundred OFDM blocks. 
  In many applications, channel may have fast time variations. Then, our algorithm may lose its advantage, 
viz., fast processing due to no need for iterations. In such cases, the LMMSE algorithm of [1], which is shown 
better than most other ML schemes in the literature, may be the best choice. However, if time variation is not 
so fast or is only moderately fast (in between fast and slow varying), our LS algorithm can be still quite useful 
as we can cope with the moderately fast time-varying environment by reducing the number of repeated 
blocks.  
 
4. Channel estimation 
  After the fine frequency offset has been corrected, the channel estimation can be readily performed. Here, 
both the method of LS and the ML technique will be investigated for channel estimation. 
4.1 LS channel estimation 
Given ˆ , we can correct the offset by multiplying (5) by NlNnje /

very small. Then, after frequency offset correction, the kth subcarrier DFT output (during training mode) can 
be approximated as

Training sequence with constant amplitude has been proven optimal for channel estimation [7]. Chu sequence 
[8], for example, falls onto this category. Using a Chu sequence { Nmkjk eP

relatively prime to N} results in N

where the fact vv

computation of matrix inversion given in (20). The estimate of the CFR vector TNHHH ],...,,[ 110 H  can be 
readily obtained as 
hFH ˆˆ v .                                                                    (22) 
Since all samples in each of the entire OFDM block are utilized in this ML estimation, we have used a total of 
)1( LN  samples for this ML channel estimation. As a result, we expect the ML channel estimator will 
outperform the previous LS channel estimator. Later in simulations, we shall make performance comparisons 
between the CFR estimators given by (15) and (22).

6. Simulation results 
  In this section, we shall present various performance results of our LS frequency tracking combined with 
channel estimation in OFDM systems. Also included will be the QAM SER performance of an OFDM system 
employing our tracking algorithm in frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Comparison will be made 
with the usual ML techniques based on one OFDM training block. 
  For a frequency-selective channel of dispersion length 9v , we choose a given exponential power profile 
with normalized channel power, i.e., 1||

simulations as well as from the theoretical result of (24). We have used 64-point DFT ( 64N ) and assume 
an actual frequency offset of 2.0 . From the figure, we see that the simulated and theoretical curves 
coincide well at high SNR values as expected since the theoretical result of (24) was derived based on high 
SNR values. Also incorporated in Fig. 1 for comparison purpose is the CRB for the usual ML frequency 
estimator based on one OFDM block as the training sample as for [1] and other earlier cited ML algorithms

5.0  and found the results very much the same as given by Fig. 7. This means, in so far as the SER 
performance is concerned, within the tracking range of half the subcarrier spacing, the estimators of our 
algorithm are robust against the frequency offset.  
  Finally, Fig. 8 compares SER performances vs. SNR between various algorithms under 2.0  using 
QAM transmission over the same channel as given for Figure 7. To compare with the LMMSE algorithm of 
[1], we have used Version B which has a faster convergence speed and wider estimation range than Version A. 
In the comparisons, we take 1L  for our algorithms, i.e., two repeated OFDM blocks are used for training. 
Thus, to be fair, we have also used two OFDM blocks as training data for the LMMSE [1] and the EM [5] 
algorithms so that same bandwidth efficiency is given for all algorithms under consideration. The simulation 
results show that our proposed algorithm using LS frequency tracking with ML channel estimator gives 
almost the same SER performance as those given by LMMSE and by the ideal case (i.e., perfect frequency 
tracking and channel estimation). While our algorithm using LS frequency tracking with LS channel 
estimation gives a slightly less SER performance. The EM algorithm given in [5] yields a very poor 
performance under 2.0 . Simulation results (not given here) show that the EM algorithm can only work 
when   is very small (less than 0.02).  
We note that, the LMMSE has comparatively the best performance due to the additional iteration process 
which gives further refined results. Nonetheless, our algorithm using LS frequency tracking with ML channel 
estimation yields a comparable performance but without the iteration process. This saves considerable 
computation time and hence contributes the major advantage of our algorithm. Table 1 displays the 
computational complexity needed for various algorithms. The complexity is counted by the arithmetic 
operations of two real numbers. One complex multiplication is equivalent to four real multiplications. Also, 
some composite data matrixes can be calculated in advanced and stored in memory before performing 
estimation algorithm. N

 in (17) of [1], for example, can be pre-computed and stored in 
memory for later use in adaptive iterations. The needed arithmetic operations displayed in Table 1 exclude 
such situations. Moreover, S  represents the number of iterative adaption needed in the proposed LMMSE 
algorithm [1]. Referring to the simulation results in [1], the number of iterations for achieving convergence 
for various values of CFOs is somewhere between 10 to 20. The reasonable value S  for use in practice is 
thus a little more than 20. 
    As an example, we take 20S  and 4/Nv  . Then, the LMMSE requires NN 24040 2   real 
multiplications, while the proposed LS frequency tracking with LS channel estimation needs 12  LNN  
real multiplications, and the proposed LS frequency tracking with ML channel estimation takes only

 real multiplications. Notably, the proposed LS frequency tracking with ML channel estimation 
has the least complexity, while the LMMSE algorithm has the heaviest load of mathematical operations. 
 
 
7. Conclusion 
  By using repeated OFDM training blocks, we successfully implement the method of least squares to 
perform frequency tracking combined with channel estimation for OFDM systems over mobile wireless 
channels. Unlike the usual ML algorithms commonly adopted for joint frequency tracking and channel 
estimation using one OFDM training block, our algorithm has no local extrema problem arising from the 
highly nonlinear nature of the multi-dimensional log-likelihood function and does not require the use of 
time-consuming adaptive iterations. Simulation results show that both the tracking performance and the error 
rate performance for OFDM systems using our proposed method are very satisfactory.

Comments from Reviewer 1 :  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
This paper show that, a proper approximation simplification of the log-likelihood function 
coupled with the aid of a good iterative correction algorithm can result in satisfactory 
estimation performance. Computer simulations have verified the useful of this approach. 
This work deserves to be published.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Comments from Reviewer 2 :  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The contents is well developed. However, the simulations seem not to be supportive 
enough for this paper. More simulation and illustration should be added. Besides, the 
language used in this paper should also be well re-constructed.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming the frequency offset normalized to subcarrier 
spacing is δ . Then, adopting unitary discrete Fourier 
transform (DFT) for signal data, after demodulation and 
discarding the cyclic prefix at the receiver, we can readily

We have decoupled δ  from h and (6) can thus be solved 
for δ  alone. However, (6) is highly nonlinear in δ  and 
contains infinite number of solutions. We only desire the one 
solution that yields the global maximum of Λln  at a given 
h. The task is not possible by analytical means. However, 
we can simplify (6) by approximation so that to reduce it to 
an analytically solvable form leading to a single global 
solution. We shall present two approximation methods. 
A. First Order Approximation 
Assuming δ  is small, we can approximate Nnmje /)(2 δπ −  
by Nnmj /)(21 δπ −+ . This is the first order 
approximation since we have retained only the terms up to 
the first order. Then, (6) becomes

where GQQGF −= . Note that we only get one single 
solution here and hence no multiple solution or local 
extrema problem is encountered. But (9) is only an 
approximate solution and hence is not very accurate. We 
can improve the accuracy by iterative corrections as 
follows. Start with iteration 1 by labeling δˆ  and r in (9) as 
1ˆδ  and 1r . We then make the correction 12

rDr Hδ= . After 
this correction, a residual CFO is assumed to remain and is 
estimated by using (9) again. Label this estimate as

2
rDr Hδ= . This corrective process is iteratively continued 
until eventually the residual CFO approaches zero. The 
final CFO estimator is obtained by summing all the residual 
CFO estimates.  
When noise is large or when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
is small, it is found that the above iterative process may 
become divergent. To remedy, we may introduce a step size 
to avoid large corrective steps. The algorithm can therefore 
be summarized as follows:

convergence, wider tracking range, and estimation 
accuracies. Then a second order approximation algorithm is 
presented with further performance improvement.
