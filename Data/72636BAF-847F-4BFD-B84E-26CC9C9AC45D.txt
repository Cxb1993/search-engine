 I. INTRODUCTION 
In order to carry out the policy of saving energy and reducing carbo-pollution, 
many countries have drawn up regulations that give fresh impetus to Electric Bike 
(EB) industry [1]. The industry and academic institutions continue to explore new 
ways to produce electric bikes that markets accept. Electric drive system [2], vehicle 
dynamics [3-4], battery diagnosis [5] and mechanical/ electric transmissions are 
investigated to achieve suitable operation efficiency. Among them, transmissions are 
especially important for energy efficiency, since they regulate the torque-speed 
characteristics in steady state [6-8] and in transience [9-11].   
Traditionally, the controller design relied on classical control in frequency domain. 
A common strategy of protecting the lead-acid battery from overcharging and the DC 
motor overheating is to regulate the current overshoot by phase-lag compensators 
[9-10]. However, this approach is hard to accommodate many objectives, including 
economy-in-energy and quickness-in-motion. Hence, motivated by advanced control 
algorithms [12-14] and control strategies [15-17], we adopt multi-objectives 
approaches to design the DC-propulsion for electric bikes. There, we investigate the 
interaction between energy utilization and motion responses of EB dynamics.  
More precisely, the investigation involves two players: the economy-in-energy (EE) 
and quickness-in-motion (QM), entering into negotiations. In this cooperation game, 
we hold a negotiation parameter to quantify the EE-QM trade-off of the controlled 
dynamics. The negotiation parameter plays like a gear ratio of transmission in 
transient state, which is needed for energy economy, especially for low-speed electric 
vehicles that are used in jammed traffics. The control synthesis developed here is 
based on multiple Hamiltonians [15]: every player is assigned with a Hamiltonian. 
Compared with the single Hamiltonian approaches that use one Hamiltonian for all 
players, this synthesis involves less conservatism in performance-in-specification and 
reveals more interactions among all players.  
Furthermore, the performance of energy consumption being specified on per 
distance renders the generalized plant served for control synthesis to be nonlinear. To 
accommodate this ad hoc vehicular nature, we incorporate the linear 
parameter-varying (LPV) technique into the game-theoretic synthesizer to obtain the 
nonlinear feedback.  
In literature, LPV modeling and syntheses are usually applied into nominal plants 
of nonlinear nature or two-time-scaled nature.  
(a) Nonlinear nature: In some scenarios, the state of a nonlinear plant consists of 
slow-time and fast-time variables. LPV control engineers formulate the nonlinear 
plant into LPV plant parametrically dependent on those slow-time variables, which 
can be on-line measured [18-22]. That is, those slow-time variables play scheduling 
 3
resistance R , mechanical inertia J , mechanical damping B  and torque coefficient 
κ . The source of effort includes the controlled voltage u  across the motor and the 
equivalent torque f  that quantifies the road inclination. The lab of [10] devised an 
Inverse Dynamics Equipment (IDE) to identify those parameters. With the same IDE, 
we do parametric identification in this work.

current, respectively, in steady state, as the input voltage is kept at u . The steady 
state of Eq. (1) indicates that ωρκ Bi =  and uiR =+ωρκ .

parameters define the mechatronic property of the considered EB, which should be 
determined first during the EB design process. It is inferred from Eq. (3) that the 
non-dimensional current i  and speed ω  are equal in steady state, valued within 
[0,1].

The LPV generalized plant of Eq. (9) is then served for the synthesis of feasibly

such that the EE and QM performances specified in Eq. (5) and (4), respectively,  are 
simultaneously satisfied. It is to be noted that the feedback in Eq. (10) is nonlinear but 
in LPV form parametrically dependent on the tire speed ω  that is taken as the 
scheduling parameter in operation. The slow-time state variable (tire speed) ω  is 
being on-line estimated by a robust observer processing the fast-time signal of motor 
current i  that is measured in real time. This robust observer is synthesized based on 
the reference [37], which is a Luenberg observer of the nominal plant in Eq. (3) with 
the mechanical load f  being the uncertain disturbance.

= YXK  for the α - negotiation.      
[Step 2] Choose a set of negotiation parameters α  and repeat Step 1 to obtain the 
corresponding set of optimal points ),( 21 γγ  in the 1γ - 2γ  2D plane. Connect those 
points into a curve of optimality. This curve divides the 1γ - 2γ  2D plane into two 
regions: feasible performances and infeasibility.  
For standard mechatronic ratios of AC characteristics β =150 and power ratings 
ϕ =325, the overall solutions of Eqs. (14)-(15) obtained through Steps 1 and 2 are 
demonstrated in Figure 2. Figure 2 represents in a non-dimensional fashion the 
personality of electric bikes: the trade-off between EE and QM. This vehicular 
personality has been commonly experienced, and can be parameterized with the 
EE-QM regulator newly developed in this paper. 
 IV. CONTROLLER CIRCUIT AND PROGRAM 
The procedure to implement the underlying EB controller is described as follows: 
[Step 1] Identify equivalent parameters of EB 
With supported materials [9-10], identify those parameters signified in Figure 1. 
[Step 2] Parameterize EE-QM regulation 
Choose a proper negotiation parameter α  in the EE-QM regulator, and then 
calculate the corresponding feedback control K  accompanied by the pair of 
performance indexes ),( 21 γγ . Plug the control into the EB dynamics in Eq. (1) that 
has been parametrically identified in Step 1, and then perform computer simulations 
with a fixed sampling time that should be identical to that assigned in the 
microcontroller DSP programming. Check the resulted EE and QM performances to 
see the need of repeating Step 2 with a new negotiation parameter α . 
[Step 3] Implement the feedback dynamics into a PIC microcontroller 
We implement the EE-QM regulator into a PIC16F87X chip. Peripheral Interface 
Controller (PIC) has suitable cost and complexity for EB control, and has embedded 
analog-to-digital (A/D) and pulse width modulation (PWM) peripherals, allowing for 
inputting analog signals from sensors and outputting PWM signals to switch power 
converters, respectively. Due to its low memory and data-bits, Finite Impulse 
Response (FIR) is not considered to program the EE-QM regulator. Moreover, PIC16 
microcontroller has comparatively simpler structure of internal timers than DSP 
microprocessor and embeds A/D and PWM modules, so we did not apply Infinite 
Impulse Response (IIR) [38,39] for DSP implementation, either. Instead, we use the 
so-called matrix iteration time-fixed (MIT) [40] method to implement 
control/observer dynamics for guaranteeing the identity between computer 
simulations and on-line operation.   
[Step 4] Include the microcontroller into an EB controller circuitry   
 9
versus the angular displacement θ  of the EB. Figure 4 shows situations in a jammed 
traffic. Their responses of energy consumption indicate that the economic type 
( 11.=α ) saves about 25% energy with respect to the quick type ( 02.=α ). Energy is 
saved because of reduced electric dissipation resulted from the depression of current 
overshoots during the acceleration and deceleration. This also protects the lead-acid 
battery from overcharging and the DC motor from overheating, and thus saves energy.  
Furthermore, we design a road-test experiment, arranging a 600-meter runway 
equipped with 6 stop flags. The EB stops at each flag, and then starts with maximum 
throttle up to the maximum speed at 38 kilometer per hour. Then, the E-bike 
decelerates and stops at the next flag. We recorded the responses of motor current, tire 
speed and battery voltage to estimate the power dissipation, and found that the driving 
range of the quick type is about 75% of that of the economic type. 
Based on the road test, we plot in Figure 5 the relationship between the amount of 
energy being saved and the negotiation parameter chosen in the EE-QM regulator. It 
is found that the percentage of energy saved with respect to the quick type ( 02.=α ), 
η , is almost proportional to the reciprocal of negotiation parameter α/1 . This linear 
relationship verifies the practicability of taking negotiation parameters to 
parameterize the trade-off between EE and QM in EB dynamics. 
 VI. CONCLUSION 
This work contributes an example to the academic realization of our common 
experience that quicker motions lead to larger consumption of energy. To the industry 
of electric bikes, this work provides a motion-energy regulator to achieve the transient 
transmission of electric bikes.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In order to carry out the policy of energy conservation and 
create new industry, Taiwan government draws up the related 
law to gives fresh impetus to electric bike industry [1]. The 
industry and academic institutions continues to explore new 
ways to produce electric bike that markets accept. 
Traditionally, the controller design of electric bikes relied on 
classical control in frequency domain. A common strategy of 
protecting the lead-acid battery from overcharging and the DC 
motor overheating is to regulate the current overshoot by 
phase-lag compensator [2-4]. For the energy conservation, 
customers begin to concern the efficiency of their electric bikes. 
Therefore, control engineers have to satisfy the multi-objective 
performance not only economy-in-energy but also quickness-
in-motion. Because user can formulate practical needs as linear 
matrix inequalities freely and numerical solve linear 
programming conveniently, model-based control has been give 
a lot of attention in recent years [5-7].      
In this paper, we investigate the interaction between energy 
utilization and motion responses of electric bike dynamics. 
Here, the economy-in-energy (EE) and quickness-in-motion 
(QM) act two players entering into negotiations with a 
negotiation parameter being assigned for quantification of the 
EE-QM trade-off of the controlled dynamics. The negotiation 
parameter plays like gear ratio of transmission in transient state, 
which is needed for energy economy especially for low-speed 
electric vehicles that are used in jammed traffic. The control 
synthesis developed here is based on multiple Hamiltonians [8]: 
every player is assigned with a Hamiltonian. Compared with 
the single Hamiltonian approach that use one Hamiltonian for 
all players, this synthesis involves less conservatism in 
performance-in-specification and reveals more interaction 
among all players.  
Furthermore, the performance of energy consumption being 
specified on per distance renders the generalized plant served 
for control synthesis to be nonlinear. To accommodate this ad 
hoc vehicular nature, we incorporate the linear parameter 
varying control [9-12] into the game-theoretic synthesizer to 
obtain the nonlinear feedback. In the implementation of the 
nonlinear compensation, we use the gain-scheduled technique 
by taking the bike speed as the gain-scheduled parameter on-
output from a Luenberger observer. Similar scenarios can be 
found in many engineering practices, such as in turbocharged 
diesel engine [13], in wind energy conversion system [14], and 
in diesel auxiliary power unit [15].  
Most of power sources available in the industry of electric 
vehicles suffer low ratio of energy either to cost, such as 
lithium-ion battery, fuel cell, high-capacity ultracapacitor, and 
ultrahigh-speed flywheel, or to weight, such as lead-acid 
battery. To manage batteries to reduce consumption of electric 
energy, Meissnerm and Richter [16], Plett [17], Rand [18] and 
Saakes et. al. [19] on-line measured the state-of-charge and/or 
state-of-health of considered batteries, and then regulated 
current outputs for conserving energy and increasing battery’s 
lifespan. Karden et. al. [20] and Faggioli et. al. [21] installed 
ultracapacitors between batteries and power converters to 
increase the energy transformation in braking phases from 
mechanical kinetics to electricity.  
Restructuring power converters can lead to vital reduction of 
electricity-to-heat. For examples, Martinez and Ray [22] 
designed bi-directional DC/DC power converters to “soften” 
switching of currents, which was later improved with four

reduce energy consumption from high-frequency on-offs of 
power transistors; and He and Nelems [24] embedded 
microprocessors into power converters for optimal timing of 
switching to suppress electricity loss.  
As for the controller circuits and programs, we are taking the 
above arguments. As for the structure of the article, 
achievements of the work are presented as follow. Section 2 
performs modeling parameterization for EB dynamics with 
specific simplifications. Section 3 develops the EE-QM 
regulator through constructing a generalized plant. Section 4

A smaller QM index 1γ  implies that the time for reaching 
referenced speed or acceleration is shorter, that is, the motion 
of EB is quicker under servocontrol. A smaller EE index 2γ  
means that heat dissipated from mechanical and electric 
resistances are less before the motions arrive at steady state. It 
is to be noted that the QM variable 1z  and the EE variable 2z  
include the motor voltage u  to protect it from becoming 
unreasonably large for regulating the EE and QM. In order to 
formulate energy-economic performance being on per distance 
into the generalized plant, we define new variable for the 
generalized performance, 11 zz ˆω= , 22 zz ˆω= , and the 
generalized disturbance rr ˆω= . 
With the introduction of new symbols above, the EB 
dynamics of Eq. (3) can be extended to the following 
generalized plant that incorporates the EE and QM 
performances:

proposed feedback system, a current senor is installed on the 
board of power converter with its output y  being sent to a 
Luenberger observer for reconstructing the tire speed and 
filtering noises out of the measured signals of motor current. 
The Luenberger observer is synthesized based on the EB 
dynamics in Eq. (3). Since the time constant of electric parts 
eτ  is much smaller in practice than that of mechanical parts mτ , 
the observed tire speed is taken as a really measured one. 
Substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (9) yields the dynamics of 
feedback system:

Any quadruple ),,,( 21 γγYX  satisfying Eqs. (14)-(15) 
defines a feasible feedback 1−= YXK  guaranteeing the 
performances of feedback dynamics to have QM index 1γ  and 
EE index 2γ . It is easy to check that the set of feasible pairs of 
indexes ),( 21 γγ  is convex. 
Based on the convexity mentioned above, we provides a 
numerical procedure in the following to represent the set of 
feasible performances ),( 21 γγ  in a 2D plane coordinated by 
1γ  and 2γ : 
[Step 1] Assign a negotiation parameter α  and then set 
12 αγγ =  in Eqs. (14)-(15). Involve the mincx.m routine in the 
Matlab LMI-lab toolbox to solve the optimal solution

corresponding optimal feedback 1−= YXK  for the α - 
negotiation.       
Step 2. Iteration of Step 1 to Step 5 is generally needed for 
arriving at a satisfied design of EB controller [2].

V. RESULTS OF COMPUTER SIMULATIONS AND ROAD TESTS 
We purchase an electric bike for experiment, keeping its DC 
motor and lead-acid battery ( 24=u V; 20=i A; 
3200=ω rpm) and taking away its controller. An improved 
controller is designed and manufactured based on the Steps 1-5 
described in Section 4, which installs an ACS754SCB-200 
Hall-effect current sensor/transducer (single bias; 0-100A input; 
0-5V output). The dimensions and equivalent parameters of the 
experimental EB are identified. A toy DC-motor is pivoted on 
the axial of the EB motor for sensing tire speeds, and a Laptop 
Dspace is carried on the running EB for the real-timed signal 
acquisition of motor currents and tire speeds. The signal 
conditioning inside the PIC16F87X chip is as follows: (1) the 
command signal 0V-5V corresponds to the motor current 0A-
20A; (2) the output of current sensor 0V-5V corresponds to the 
motor current 0A-100A; (3) the frequency of the PWM is 20k 
Hz with its duty cycle 0%-100% being proportional to motor 
voltage 0V-24V; and (4) the sampling time in the MIT 
program is 010.=sT s.   
Firstly, we choose two types of feedback dynamics to check 
the ability of the developed EE-QM regulator to quantify the 
trade-off between QM and EE. One is an economic type with 
the negotiation parameter being 11.=α  and corresponding 
EE-QM indexes ),( 21 γγ  being ).,.( 083802 , and the other is a 
quick type with the negotiation parameter being 02.=α  and 
corresponding indexes ),( 21 γγ  being ).,.( 423711 . Figure 4 
records the responses of road tests of these two types of 
controllers. We find that Allegro ACS754SCB-200 Hall-effect 
current sensor is of wide bandwidth and, as of such, lures high-
frequency noises into the loop. Though noises contaminate 
measurement, we can discern the coincidence between 
measured responses and simulated responses, which validates 
the accuracy of computer simulations upon the reduced EB 
dynamics with identified parameters for studying the 
personality of the considered EB. 
It is computationally convenient to change the independent 
variable of the EB dynamics in Eq. (3) from the time   to the 
angular displacement θ   ( ωθ =dtd / ):

We simulate based on Eq. (16) the responses of energy 
consumption, motor current and tire speed versus the angular 
displacement θ  of the EB. Figure 5 shows situations in a 
jammed traffic. Their responses of energy consumption 
indicate that the economic type ( 11.=α ) saves about 25% 
energy with respect to the quick type ( 02.=α ). Energy is 
saved because of reduced electric dissipation resulted from the 
depression of current overshoots during the acceleration and 
deceleration. This also protects the lead-acid battery from 
overcharging and the DC motor from overheating, and thus 
saves energy. That is out of the scope of this paper.   
In Figure 6, we plot the relationship between the amount of 
energy being saved and the negotiation parameter chosen in the 
EE-QM regulator. It is found that the percentage of energy 
saved with respect to the quick type ( 02.=α ),η , is almost 
proportional to the reciprocal of negotiation parameter α/1 . 
This linear relationship verifies the practicability of taking 
negotiation parameters to parameterise the trade-off between 
EE and QM in EB dynamics.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
This work contributes an example to the academic 
realization of our common experience that quicker motions 
lead to larger consumption of energy. To the industry of 
electric bikes, this work provides a motion-energy regulator to 
achieve the transient transmission of electric bikes.
