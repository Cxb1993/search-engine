中文摘要 
隨著年齡的老化，人類動脈硬化的程度愈形明顯。目前臨床上對於如何檢測或評估動
脈硬化的程度尚未有定論，且眾說紛紜，因此，本計畫之目的就是要發展一套以微振動方
式非侵入測量血管管壁特性的系統，並定量分析動脈的硬化程度。先對表層血管壁施於不
同頻率之微小弦波位移，可由反應力、位移量及頻率間的關係，推得血管的抗彈性力(即血
管硬度)。本計畫已完成一套微振動式非侵入血管抗彈性力的測量系統之建立，並成功開發
出一套可自動分析血管動態抗彈性力之軟體程式；同時，也對 28 位受測者進行了冷熱刺激
實驗，分別完成冷熱刺激對血管抗彈性力的比較分析，從中發現，冷刺激下最大橈動脈抗
彈性力（0.807±0.423 dyne/cm）及抗彈性力範圍（0.112±0.046 dyne/cm）均顯著地大於在常
溫下的情形(0.563± 0.341 dyne/cm; 0.080 ±0.041 dyne/cm)(p<0.05)。再者，業已將本計畫的研
究成果提出專利的申請；最後，本計畫之實質貢獻在於能儘早定量出受測者的動脈硬化程
度，故能及時預防與血管硬化相關疾病的發生，進而確保國人身體的健康。

的順應性；在血壓波形分析技術中，則是利用動脈血壓舒張期的指數形衰減現象，來推算

(Voume Elastic Modulus) [34]，抗彈性係數 (Elastic Modulus) [74]，楊氏抗彈性係數 (Young’s

請參考表１。本計畫即針對由血管的最大反應力、外加最大位移振幅、及振動頻率之間的
關係來推得動態的血管抗彈性力。 
 
二、研究目的 
目前臨床上對於如何檢測或評估動脈硬化的程度尚未有定論，且眾說紛紜，有鑑於此，
發展一套可定量分析動脈硬化程度的系統，則有其重要性及急迫性。雖然有許多估測值（表
１）試著量化血管硬度，但由於血管壁的不均勻結構，不同部位管內壓的差異，以及平滑
肌張度的變異，在在使得先前所述之估測值都只是血管硬度的近似值而已，而非一可信賴
的血管硬度指標 [47]。 
 針對表１所列第 8 至 11 項地區性動脈硬度指標的缺失，分述如后：(1)動脈血管的硬度
並非一固定值而是會隨時間或依賴血壓而改變，而先前研究之地區性指標測量值都為一固
定值，並不符合實際情形；(2)先前地區性指標均須同時測量兩個（血壓、直徑）或者三個
血流相關參數，方可求出指標值，若這些參數是由不同的地方所推算出來的，則該指標所
代表的特定地區的真實性將受到嚴重的質疑；(3)由於血管的硬度是隨時間而改變的，故受
測者心跳的快慢，將直接影響上述地區性硬度指標之準確度；及(4)先前地區性指標必須量
得血管的體積或口徑，但是要準確地獲得時變的血管體積或口徑，在現有技術上是頗具困
難的，故會降低地區性指標的可靠度。 
基於上述之說明，本計畫之目的就是要以微機械振動的技術，來擷取、定量、分析態
動的血管硬化程度，主要的研究內容，包括微振動技術的理論推導，硬體電路的實務製作，
軟體程式的撰寫，校準比對的執行，臨床實驗與測試，以及統計分析與應用。而本計畫之
預期貢獻在於能儘早定量出受測者的動脈硬化程度，及適時預防與血管硬化相關之疾病的
發生，進而確保國人身體的健康。

的力道，並由力-位移間複數關係之實部推估出心臟肌壁的時變抗彈性力 (Elastance)，而成
功地定量分析區域性心肌抗彈性力 [99,100]。 
 
四、研究方法 
１、微振動技術的理論基礎 
本計畫利用微振動技術(Minute Vibration Technique)來測量動態動脈血管抗彈性力
(Dynamic Arterial Elastance)，感應探棒前端探頭的位移量(Displacement)，將被調控成以弦
波(Sinusoidal)方式前進，同時碰觸管壁的接觸力(Contact Force)，則藉由力感測元件來加以
感應。我們若將動脈血管壁的機械特徵由三個並聯元件(或組成)所模擬 [99]，而此三種組
件分別代表阻尼(Inertia)，黏滯性(Viscosity)和抗彈性力(Elastance)的組成成份(如圖２所
示)，則由血液動力學得知，被測物體的阻尼(視同質量)所產生的阻力和加速度(Acceleration)
成正比，黏滯性所產生的阻力和物體的速度(Velocity)成正比，而抗彈性力所產生的阻力則
與物體的位移(x)成正比。因此，對一物體所施加的力(F)，應該相等於上述三項阻力之和

２、動態血管特性偵測裝置之硬體製作及系統建立 
藉由個人電腦送出觸發訊號，透過弦波位移觸發裝置中的弦波產生級、放大級及推動
級電路，送出不同頻率的弦波位移，使微振動器之感應探棒能以弦波方式前進或後退。再
利用力感測元件來感測元件與血管之間的接觸力，經由力感測裝置(內含緩衝級，帶通濾波
級，及放大級)加以適當放大及濾波，而將測得的接觸力經由類比／數位轉換器轉換成數位
訊號，送至電腦進一步處理。為有效達到微量弦波位移的變化(最大位移量為 0.18 至 0.25 
mm)，須將微振動器的本體加以固定(由自行設計的支架)，並使感應探棒的前進方向垂直於
受測之動脈血管壁，以期獲得最大的接觸力。又，感應探棒，位於感應探棒前端的力感測
元件，其和血管壁接觸的面積應小於0.2 cm2，才可符合一般人橈動脈的口徑大小，而能準
確感測其間的接觸力。 
所研製動態血管特性偵測系統之硬體電路，已透過既有的儀器設備(例如Biopac擷取系
統，數位示波器，功能函數產生器等)，逐步進行電子測試。所測得的振盪式連續血壓波形，
須進一步作血壓的校準。於實驗室中，我們已利用水銀血壓計、及商用自動血壓計來進行
靜態壓力的校準，致於血壓波形部份則採用壓張式(Tonometry)連續血壓儀器所量得的波形
來進行比對及校準工作。

後逐次增加微振動系統之頻率( 40Hz-85Hz，每次
增加 5Hz。

On Calculating the Time-Varying Elastance Curve of a Radial Artery 
Using a Miniature Vibration Method

Abstract — We examined the time-varying elastance of the 
radial arterial wall using a minute vibration approach in fif-
teen volunteers. A sinusoidal displacement of 1.5~2.0 mm with 
a frequency range from 50 to 100 Hz was used to impose on the 
superficial radial artery.  Meanwhile, a force sensor was used 
to pick up the contact force exerted by the radial arterial wall.  
The amplitude of the complex force was found to be negatively 
proportional to the squared angular frequency imposed on the 
radial artery.  A linear regression line can be obtained using 
the different frequencies (x-axis) and their force responses (y-
axis). The intercept of the regression line with the y-axis de-
notes the elastance and the slope the effective contact mass.  
Ten elastance values corresponding to 10 different timings in a 
cardiac cycle were used to construct a time-varying elastance 
curve.  It was found that the elastance curve fundamentally 
follows the arterial pressure waveform.  In conclusion, we have 
successfully calculated the arterial elastance values at various 
cardiac timings by applying the minute vibration method, and 
the pattern of the elastance curve bears a resemblance to a 
blood pressure waveform.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In addition to aging, several kinds of disease result in 
vascular hardening, such as the cerebral vessel disease [1], 
cardiovascular disease [2], diabetes mellitus [3] and renal 
disease [4].  Thus, it is important to perform an early detec-
tion of the arterial stiffness using a reliable method. To date, 
there have been different technologies for directly or indi-
rectly assessing the arterial stiffness, including the ultra-
sound echo-tracking (Doppler)[5], analysis of pulse transit 
time[6], impedance plethysomgraphy [7], photo-
plethysmography [8], oscillometry [9], tonometry [10],  and 
analysis of pressure waveform [11]. 
Up to now, there is no reliable way to evaluate the degree 
of the arterial stiffness (elastance) in the clinical setting. 
Thus, the purpose of this thesis is to develop a noninvasive 
apparatus for measuring the arterial wall properties by 
means of minute vibration technique, and to calculate the 
time-varying arterial elastance curve. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A measurement system consisting mainly of a micro-
vibration generator, a force-sensing device, an analog-to-
digital and digital-to-analog converters, and a personal 
computer was constructed to calculate radial arterial time-
varying elastance curve using the minute vibration method.  
Characteristics of arterial wall were assumed to be gov-
erned by three components, including the inertia, viscosity, 
and elastance [12]. Furthermore, the force exerted by the 
inertia component was denoted by the product of mass (M) 
and acceleration (d2x/dt2), the force induced by the viscosity 
component was equal to the product of blood viscosity (η) 
and velocity (dx/dt), and the force generated by the elas-
tance component was represented by the product of elas-
tance (E) and displacement (x).  According to the concept of 
force balance, an external force imposed on the arterial wall 
should equal to the sum of the forces from the three compo-
nents [12], as follows: 
Ex
dt
dx
dt
xdMF ++= η
2
2
  (1) 
The viscosity term is relatively very small, as compared 
with the other two force terms. After neglecting the viscos-
ity term, we can obtain  
Ex
dt
xdMF +≈ 2
2
  (2) 
If a sinusoidal displacement is imposed on the arterial 
wall, then relation between the complex contact force and 
the angular frequency can be represented by 
)()()( 2 ηωωω jMEF +−=   (3) 
From Eq. (3), the real part of the complex contact force is 
inversely proportional to squared angular frequency (ω2).  
Thus, if we make a plot using the real part of the contact 
force (vertical axis) with respect to ω2 (horizontal axis). By 
exciting the arterial wall with a small and different-
frequency sinusoidal displacement, a regression line can be 
obtained. Thus, the intercept of the vertical axis with the 
regression line corresponds to the wall elastance and the 
inverse of the slope of the regression line is equivalent to 
the effective mass of the arterial contact wall.

pressure, the dynamic radial wall elastance varied from 
1.422×106 to 6.557×106 dyne/cm, and the average of maxi-
mum elastance became 3.017×106 ± 1.779×106 dyne/cm. In 
the pressurized situation, the average of maximum elastance 
was increased by 62.8%. But, two of the eighteen subjects 
showed a decrease in their maximum elastance with the 
pressurized cuff around the upper arm.    
Whereas, in the other results of participants were corre-
sponding with a Psychophysiology theory. It was found in 
the current result that the elastance curve varied synchro-
nously with the radial blood pressure waveform. Therefore 
we can estimate the dynamic radial artery elastance with the 
response to changes in the radial artery. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
Using the minute vibration method, we have successfully 
determined 10 values of the radial arterial elstance at 10 
different timing points in one cardiac cycle. A full arterial 
elastance curve is then constructed on the basis of these 10 
values.  The present elastance, a local index of arterial stiff-
ness, is totally different from that measured from an arterial 
segment [6-8] or the whole arterial system [13].  
The radial artery of interest in the current study is as-
sumed equivalent to a mechanical system, and the elastance 
is equal to a spring’s constant. Although local, the arterial 
elastance determined by the vibration technique obviously 
represents an absolute rather than a relative value.   Thus, 
one advantage of the study is capable of calculating a re-
gional and absolute elastance value. Another advantage is 
the construction of an entire elastance curve over one car-
diac cycle.  
The drawbacks of the present study include high sensitiv-
ity of the measurement location, mechanical instability of 
the measurement system, and lack of a precise calibration 
method. 
V. CONCLUSIONS  
We have calculated the arterial elastance values at vari-
ous cardiac timing points by applying the minute vibration 
method, and then constructed the whole time-varying arte-
rial elastance curve in a cardiac cycle.  It is found that basi-
cally the shape of the calculated elastance curve bears a 
resemblance to the arterial blood pressure waveform.

loaded compliance of the brachial artery. We used an airflow
meter and a pressure transducer to record the pumped airflow
and cuff pressure, respectively, to characterize the cuff that com-
prises both the tissue properties and the elastic cuff mechanism
in each oscillometric measurement [15]–[18]. In the cuff de-
flation, the oscillation amplitude (OA) was extracted from the
oscillation waveform of cuff pressure. A change in the arterial
volume embedded in the cuff volume can be derived from the
cuff characteristics and OA. Thus, a nonlinear relationship be-
tween the changed volume and the cuff pressure in a brachial
artery can be obtained. Finally, this study examined 32 patients
who complained of numbness or lack of strength in the lower
limbs to measure the arterial compliance (Cecho) with the diam-
eter and flow velocity of brachial artery.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
designed measurement apparatus and the method used to calcu-
lateCosci . Section III presents the standard calibration procedure
and the clinical test methods, and Section IV the results from
comparisons of Cecho . The results are discussed and conclusions
are drawn in Section V.
II. MEASURING DYNAMIC COMPLIANCE
Fig. 1 shows the schematic of how to employ the artery and
air-cuff models to determine the loaded arterial compliance via
the oscillometric method. Because the relationship between the
arterial pressure and volume is nonlinear, the changes in arterial
volume should not be proportional to the cuff pressure. In the
skin-surface-based detection method, a volume pulse from the
underlying artery needs to transmit through the intermediate tis-
sue and the cuff cover before it can be detected. If the cuff is
tightly wrapped around the arm during the deflation period, the
cuff model must consist of the intermediate tissue characteris-
tics and the elastic cuff mechanism [15], [16]. By the way, the
arm geometry and the interaction between the cuff and upper
arm should also be included in the cuff model. Once the cuff
model in each measurement is established, the change in the
arterial volume can be estimated. According to the fact that a
nonlinear relationship between the arterial changed volume and
the transmural pressure exists in an artery [17], [18], the loaded
C–P curve may thus be determined as the change in the arterial
volume divided by the blood pulse pressure.
Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of the proposed measure-
ment system. The oscillometry system contained a cuff, an

air-pumping motor, a releaser valve, a pressure transducer, and
an airflow meter. The airflow meter and pressure transducer si-
multaneously recorded the pumped airflow and cuff pressure
during the inflation period, with the airflow converted into the
volume by integration. The relationship between the cuff pres-
sure and the cuff air volume (i.e., the cuff model) was con-
structed by a recursive regression approach (RRA) that allowed
artifacts introduced by the blood pressure waveform and pump-
ing motor to be removed. During the deflation period, only the
pressure transducer recorded the cuff pressure, from which the
oscillation waveform was extracted. However, the OAs are not
only related to the volume change of the brachial artery, but are
also influenced by cardiovascular diseases and artificial motions
during clinical measurements. Fuzzy logic discriminator and a
recursive weighting regression approach (RWRA) as described
by Lin et al. [19] were used to construct the oscillometry model
with the cuff pressure and OAs as input. This method can be
applied to effectively reduce the noise level in the OAs.
A. System Design
We used the MSP430 microcontroller that exhibits ultralow
power consumption and has useful functions for building a
portable apparatus. In the sensing module of Fig. 2, a silicon-
membrane pressure transducer (range: 5 psi; SCX05DNC,
SenSym) was used to measure the cuff pressure, which was
calibrated using a mercury column sphygmomanometer. When
the analog cuff pressure signal (PC ) was bandpass filtered from
0.1 to 3 Hz to yield the oscillation signal, maximum change
in positive slopes was used to find the OAs on the oscillation
signal [17]. During the peak detection process, the oscillation
signal slope was measured periodically at rising side, and unless
the slope meets some predetermined criteria, the peaks would
be measured and compared. The airflow meter (AWM3300,
Honeywell) has a range of 1000 sccm. The cuff pressure, oscil-
lation waveform, and airflow signals were then digitized using
a 12-bit A/D converter at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. Because of
airflow and pumping-time limits, we used pulse width modula-
tion to control the pumping rate of the motor during the inflation
period and the deflation rate of the releaser valve during the de-
flation period.

arterial blood pulse. When connected to the cuff, this analyzer
pumped airflow pulses to the cuff that varied with the cuff pres-
sure. Therefore, we wound the cuff around a phantom and con-
nected it to the analyzer. An airflow meter (range: 100 sccm;
AWM3100, Honeywell) was used to record the airflow pulse
generated by the analyzer during the deflation period. The over-
all calibration system is shown in Fig. 3. Because the simulated
oscillation waveform was very clean, a RWRA was not used
in the calibration system. We set the analyzer with a systolic
blood pressure (SBP) of 120 mmHg, a DBP of 80 mmHg, and
a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 90 mmHg. The cuff pressure
was pumped to 160 mmHg before beginning the deflation pro-
cess. When the cuff pressure decreased to below 40 mmHg, the
valve was opened for ending measurement. According to (7),
the Vpulse artery could be calculated from the oscillation signal.
The actual changed volume was directly calculated from the
airflow pulse by (1). Fig. 4(a) shows the true changed volume
at different cuff pressures, and Fig. 4(b) shows the calibration
results with a regression correlation coefficient (r) of 0.937 and
a standard error of estimate (SEE) of 0.015.
B. Clinical Experiment
The experimental protocol was applied to 32 subjects (14 men
and 18 women) aged 68 ± 15 years (mean ± SD; range: 19 to
93 years) undergoing diagnostic evaluation for peripheral arte-
rial embolism at Hsinchu Hospital, Taiwan, between December
2005 and July 2006. The brachial blood pressure was measured

BASELINE HEMODYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF 32 PATIENTS
with an electric sphygmomanometer (DINAMAP PROCARE
100, GE Medical Systems) in the left arm of each patient. To
classify the patients, both the blood pressure in the arterial seg-
ment of interest and the ankle-brachial index were measured in
each patient with a plethysmographic device (Mini-Lab 3100,
Parks) to determine whether the patient had the embolism symp-
tom. Our designed instrument was then used to measure the
brachial artery. After that, a duplex ultrasound scan machine
(7.5M Hz, M2410B, AGILENT, Hewlett Packard) was utilized
by a doctor to measure the pulse wave of peripheral vessel,
and then to determine if an arterial or venous embolism existed
and to localize the embolism position. Finally, the duplex ultra-
sound scan was used to measure the arterial internal diameter
and velocity of blood flow in the left brachial artery. The an-
gle was 60◦ in measuring the velocity. The measurements were
performed on the right arm in patients who either had an arteri-
ovenous fistula in the left arm or no left arm due to amputation.
The echo-based arterial compliance was calculated using the
following equation:
Cecho =
π · r2 ∫ TmT0 v(t) dt
∆Ppulse
(11)
where r is the arterial internal radius, T0 the time at the zero
blood velocity, Tm the time at the maximal blood velocity, and
v the blood flow velocity.
IV. RESULTS
Baseline hemodynamic data of the important variables for
characterizing the patients are presented in Table I. Obviously,
the patients included in the study had a wide range of arterial
blood pressure. The relationship between the cuff pressure and
cuff volume during the inflation period for one patient (age: 67
years; SBP: 155 mmHg; DBP: 63 mmHg; MAP: 105 mmHg)
is shown in Fig. 5. The solid and dotted curves describing the
relationship are based on raw and constructed data, respectively.
It is worthwhile noting that these two curves become much
closer when the cuff pressure is greater than 20 mmHg, as
compared with lower cuff pressure levels. We also found that
the raw data contained some disturbances that, if not reduced in
calculating the slope of the cuff model, resulted in large errors in
Ccuﬀ . Fig. 6 shows, with (10), the loaded compliance–pressure
curve determined from the same patient, as in Fig. 5, under
the different cuff pressures. Based on this compliance–pressure
curve, we can straightforwardly obtain the loaded compliance
of an artery of interest under various cuff pressure levels. For

largest among the three compliance values, and Cosci(PSys) and
Cosci(PDia) are smaller. It was also found that the linear regres-
sion coefficient between Cecho and Cosci(PDia) was the largest
(r = 0.666) and that between the Cecho and Cosci(PSys) was the
smallest (r = 0.571). The results indicated that under a variety of
loaded conditions, the compliance using the oscillometry-based
method was in moderate agreement with the echocardiography-
derived compliance.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Many noninvasive methods have been used to indirectly es-
timate the local arterial stiffness or the systematic compli-
ance, including pulse-wave-velocity [22], echocardiography [7],
MRI [23], [24], impedance plethysmography [11], [14], photo-
plethysmography [12], [21], oscillometry [13], [25], [26], and
model-based approaches [27], [28]. The imaging methods such
as echocardiography and MRI could measure an absolute vascu-
lar diameter change to determine the arterial stiffness. The other
methods only measured the relative arterial volume change [11],
[14] or related physical parameter [12], [13], [23]–[25]. In these
indirect measurement methods, the oscillometry of Drzewiecki
and Pilla [13] is very close to our present study. However, they
thought that the cuff compliance is fixed, so the calibration of
cuff compliance was just made once. Furthermore, they did not
consider the effects of the intermediate tissue and geometry of
the cuff or the upper arm on the compliance measurement, but
these effects are really present and have been described in previ-
ous studies [15]–[18]. Therefore, we used an airflow meter and
pressure transducer to construct the cuff model that included the
cuff compliance and subject’s tissue compliance in each mea-
surement. Moreover, these methods always need 10–20 min to
measure the arterial stiffness. We proposed a method that is
based on oscillometry, so the time of measurement was only
30–40 s.
In the present paper, we applied a proposed oscillometry-
based approach to estimate the loaded compliance of the brachial
artery. The main feature of the designed method is that it can
estimate Vpulse artery under different cuff pressures. However,
a challenge is also to calibrate the measured arterial volume,
which is a problem faced by all studies that do not use imag-
ing techniques such as ultrasound or MRI to measure the ves-
sel diameter [11]–[14]. A noninvasive blood pressure analyzer
(CuffLink) that employs a piston can pump different air volumes
to the cuff according to different cuff pressures. As the actual
changed volume is directly obtained, it is utilized to calibrate the
estimated Vpulse artery , with a correlation coefficient of 0.937±
0.015. We considered that the accuracy of the calibrated method
was affected by several factors, such as the cuff material and
the blood pressure simulator. Due to the stiff cuff cover, the
cuff elasticity results in a low sensitivity that, in turn, affects
the estimated accuracy of Vpulse artery . In the hypertension or
hypotension case, there is a shift in the actual changed volume
curve at the cuff pressure axis, as shown in Fig. 4(a). In the ar-
rhythmia case, the abnormal beats will be corrected by RWRA.
Therefore, in this calibration experiment, the pumping pressure
was designed to range from 40 to 160 mm Hg.
The frequency range of the oscillation waveform was
0.1∼3 Hz, and hence, the baseline was zero. Moreover, since
the negative and positive envelopes of the oscillation waveform
follow each other, the oscillometry only used the positive en-
velope to determine the SBP and DBP. Furthermore, several
factors (e.g., motion artifacts and respiration) can introduce un-
predictable fluctuations into the OAs during the construction of
the oscillometry model. According to (7), smaller fluctuations
in the OA resulted in a larger change in the arterial volume.
Therefore, we adopt the fuzzy logic discriminator and RWRA
used by Lin et al. [19] to build the oscillometry model with the
cuff pressure and OAs as inputs.
The distensibilities calculated at the MAP were found to dif-
fer significantly between hypertension and control groups [29].
Moreover, the arterial compliance can be calculated from the
diastolic portion of the pressure pulse contour [30], [31], which
is the measured pressure waveform having the lowest distortion.
In the study, the Vpulse artery can be directly obtained from the
cuff and oscillometric models. Once the dynamic Vpulse artery
has been derived from the calculated calibration curve, we may
theoretically be able to obtain the oscillometry-derived loaded
compliance of brachial artery in different loaded conditions dur-
ing the cuff deflation period.
Arterial stiffness may be measured by many different tech-
niques according to the different physical definitions. The ar-
terial segment compliance is generally the ratio of change in
vessel volume to the change in pressure. By the way, the change
in vessel volume can be approximately derived from the change
in lumen diameter [7]–[9], under the assumption that the artery
possesses a constant length, and a circular cross section, and a
uniform radius in the axial direction. We validate the proposed
Cosci by comparing it with Cecho , which was measured by the
echocardiographic method. Obviously, Cecho estimated in the
study is represented by the diameter (or area) change for a given
pressure step, ∆D/∆P (centimeter per millimeter of mercury
or square centimeter per millimeter of mercury), and it is merely
a relative estimate rather than an absolute one. Due to its simplic-
ity and noninvasiveness, Safar et al [7], [32], [33] have used it to
help in diagnosing compliance-related cardiovascular diseases.
To estimate the echo-based brachial compliance, we calculate
the transient volume change by integrating the blood velocity
from the zero-velocity time to the maximum-velocity time. The
transient volume change may be considered to be reasonably
proportional to the change in the brachial artery. This can par-
tially explain why a great difference in magnitude is present
between Cosci and Cecho . It is also worthwhile noting that Cecho
is obtained by means of a direct measurement, but Cosci by an
indirect approach. As a consequence, the comparison between
these two regional compliances is still meaningful, in spite of
their different magnitudes.
Although the majority of the stiffness measurements were
made for experimental and physiological studies rather than in
clinical practice, a number of evidences have indicated that a
strong correlation exists between arterial stiffness and certain
cardiovascular diseases [1], [5], [6]. Therefore, these stiffness
measurements could show the prognostic value or the predic-
tors of risk. In our studies, the linear regression coefficients

LV mechanical eﬃciency may tend to correlate linearly with the ventriculo–arterial coupling index, although
the abnormal coupling between the left ventricle and arterial system still exists.
Keywords: Ventriculo–arterial coupling; Eﬀective arterial elastance; Ventricular elastance; Mechanical
eﬃciency; Acute myocardial infarction (AMI); End-systolic pressure–volume relation.
INTRODUCTION
The performance of the cardiovascular system depends
prominently on the interaction of the left ventricle and
arterial system. Thus, left ventriculo–arterial coupling,
one of crucial determinants of cardiovascular function,
has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on both the magnitude and
eﬃciency of transfer of left ventricular (LV) stroke
work to the arterial system.1–5 As shown in previous
studies,2,6–9 the coupling between the left ventricle and
arterial system can be quantitatively explained by using
LV pressure–volume planes. In addition, LV pump-
ing performance can be characterized by the ventric-
ular end-systolic pressure–volume relationship (Ees),
whereas the LV afterload, i.e. the arterial system, can
be similarly measured using the arterial end-systolic
pressure–stroke volume relationship (Ea). Thus, the
Ees/Ea ratio may serve as a reliable index for evalu-
ating the ventriculo–arterial coupling.
It is believed that in normal physiological conditions,
the arterial system and left ventricle are virtually opti-
mally matched and work at an Ees/Ea ratio close to
unity. Simultaneously, the left ventricle can provide the
arterial system with maximal stroke work under the
optimal coupling situation.4,5,10 On the contrary, the
ventriculo–arterial coupling may become suboptimal in
various cardiovascular diseases or in diﬀerent stress con-
ditions. For instance, heart failure generally results in
a reduced Ees and an increased Ea, thus diminish-
ing the Ees/Ea ratio.3,5,11–13 Also, in patients with
acute myocardial infarction (AMI), Ea may maintain
unchanged but Ees may be decreased, leading to an
Ees/Ea ratio of less than one.1,9 Thus, the ventriculo–
arterial coupling in infarcted hearts may be diﬀerent
from that in normal hearts and is worthwhile further
investigation.
Accordingly, the purpose of this work is to examine
the ventricular–arterial coupling relationship in normal
sinus rhythm condition in patients with post-AMI after
thrombolysis and percutaneous coronary intervention,
to make sure whether a linear correlation between one of
the two volume elastances (Ees and Ea) and the Ees/Ea
ratio exists in infarcted hearts, and to see whether there
is a linear correlation between the mechanical eﬃciency
of the left ventricle and the Ees/Ea ratio, when the EF
is greater or less than 50%.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Twenty-six patients with single-vessel AMI were stud-
ied in the catheterization laboratories of the Kaohsiung
Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. AMI
was documented by symptoms, cardiac enzymes, and
abnormalities of electrocardiogram (ECG). Excluded
from the current study were the patients who had atrial
ﬁbrillation, obvious valvular disease, recent CVA, severe
systemic disease, malignancy, old myocardial infarc-
tion, cardiogenic shock, bleeding tendency, unstable
angina, expending infarction, or New York Heart Asso-
ciation functional class IV. At ﬁrst, the patient’s his-
tory, medication, physical condition, and laboratory
data were reviewed in detail. If patient had no con-
traindications for thrombolytic therapy, this interven-
tion was considered ﬁrst. Intravenously thrombolytic
therapy (streptokinase 1,500,000 units over 30–60min)
was administered to the 26 eligible patients within
6 h after the AMI event. In 18 of the 26 patients,
the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
(PTCA) procedure was performed at ﬁrst week (5–7
days) to achieve Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarc-
tion (TIMI) ﬂow grade 3 in the infart-related vessel.
Informed consent was obtained from each patient and
the study protocol was approved by the Human Inves-
tigation Committee of the Kaohsiung Veterans General
Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
Adjunctive pharmacologic therapy followed the stan-
dards of the intravenously thrombolytic therapy. Hep-
arin was administered to the 26 patients for at least
48h. The indication of anticoagulation during the
period after the thrombolytic therapy and before PTCA
procedure was individualized to each patient indepen-
dently of the LVEF in the study group. Based on the
EF, these patients were divided into two groups. One
patient group (Group 1) including 18 subjects had EF
of 50% or more. The other (Group 2) containing eight
patients had EF of less than 50%.
Experimental Protocol
For the two group patients, the LV pressure–volume
study is conducted immediately after the PTCA pro-
cedure. After patients were medicated with diazepam

Ea and Ees/Ea ratio, and the ventricular mechanical
eﬃciency and Ees/Ea ratio were determined by linear
regression methods. Diﬀerence between the hemody-
namic parameters for the two patient groups (Groups 1
and 2), such as the end-systolic and end-diastolic pres-
sure or volume, stroke work, and so forth, was compared
using unpaired t tests. A p-value of 0.05 or less was con-
sidered statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Basic characteristics of the patients included in the
study are summarized in Table 1. There was no sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence between Group 1 (EF  50%) and
Group 2 (EF < 50%) in the age, gender, height, weight,
body surface area, hypertension, peak creatine kinase,
Killip class, myocardial infarction location, Thrombol-
ysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) ﬂow grade before
PTCA, and the portion of the patients receiving PTCA
treatment.
Hemodynamic variables related to the two patient
groups are summarized in Table 2. There was no sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence between the two groups in the heart
rate, end-diastolic pressure, and end-systolic pressure.
The maximum derivative of the LV pressure determined
from patients in Group 1 was signiﬁcantly greater than
that in patients in Group 2 (p < 0.001). Even with

a signiﬁcant increase in both the end-diastolic volume
and the end-systolic volume in Group 2 as compared
with that in Group 1, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
stroke volume exists. Additionally, there is no signif-
icant diﬀerence in the ventricular chamber elastance,
eﬀective arterial elastance, and their ratio in the two
patient groups.
Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the ven-
tricular chamber elastance and the ratio of Ees and
Ea in both Groups 1 and 2, respectively. By linear
regression analysis, a correlation coeﬃcient is found
to be greater in the ﬁrst patient group (r = 0.84,
p < 0.001) with EF of  50% than the second patient
group (r = 0.76, p < 0.05) with EF of < 50%. Figure 3
shows the relationship between the eﬀective arterial
elastance and the ratio of Ees and Ea in both Groups
1 and 2, respectively. Since low correlation coeﬃcients
(r = −0.02 and −0.40) are obtained from both patient
groups, a poor linear relationship is present between the
coupling index and the eﬀective arterial elastance.
In Fig. 4(A), the LV stroke work per cardiac cycle
(7188 ± 1923mmHg × ml) corresponding to the inside
area of the ventricular pressure–volume loop from the
patients in Group 1 is signiﬁcantly greater than that
(5677± 670mmHg×ml) from the patients in Group 2
(p < 0.05). On the contrary, as shown in Fig. 4(B),

mechanical eﬃciency is found to be positively and

EF of < 50% demonstrate a poor linear relationship
(r = 0.001) between their mechanical eﬃciency and the
coupling index (Ees/Ea).
DISCUSSION
The slope of the end-systolic pressure–volume relation
has been extensively utilized as a reliable index for LV
contractility, due to its load-independent property.17,18
In the study, we determine the LV chamber elastance
Ees by using multiple pressure–volume loops obtained
with reduced venous return by vena cava occlusion. The
results show that in spite of distinct EF levels ( 50%
and < 50%), no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in Ees in the AMI
patients between Group 1 (an average of 1.57, ranging
from 0.50 to 2.24mmHg/ml) and Group 2 (an average
of 1.45, ranging from 0.51 to 1.33mmHg/ml), at 5–7
days after the onset of symptoms. Apparently, the aver-
age of the LV chamber elastance for the infarcted hearts
in either one of the two groups seems to be declined,
as compared with normal human cardiac contractility
(3.51mmHg/ml).19
The arterial system, an equivalent of the LV load-
ing, can be characterized by the slope of the arterial
end-systolic pressure–stroke volume relation (the arte-
rial eﬀective elastance, Ea).14,20
In the study, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
Ea between the two patient groups (Table 2). In
patients after an AMI event, their arterial tone should
be aﬀected by the compensation mechanisms (either
the neural or humeral regulation), and might in turn
alter the LV afterload. The patients included in the
work receive the thrombolytic therapy once they are
diagnosed as experiencing an AMI event, and their
hemodynamic variables are measured after diagnostic
catheterization or immediately after PTCA procedure
(in 20 of the 26 patients), generally around one week
after the thrombolysis. Thus, the compensation mech-
anism induced by the AMI episode may still persist in
the transient state.
A number of previous reports have demonstrated
that a LV pressure–volume plane can serve as a good
tool to help in analyzing the interaction between the left
ventricle and arterial system in human1,3 and canine
circulation.2,4,6 In this manner, the ventriculo–arterial
coupling can be quantiﬁed by the Ees/Ea ratio, and
the ratio has been further demonstrated to be a reli-
able index for characterizing the coupling.21,22 The
present results show a variety of the Ees/Ea ratio in
AMI-patients shortly after the thrombolysis in both
Group 1 (an average of 0.78, ranging from 0.32 to
1.45mmHg/ml) and Group 2 (an average of 0.72, rang-
ing from 0.41 to 1.05mmHg/ml), in spite of no sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence in the index for the two EF-based
groups. Also, the average in either one of the two groups
is abnormally diﬀerent from the value of 1.62 for a nor-
mal operating human heart,19 and is also less than the
theoretically derived Ees/Ea value of unity.21
It is interesting that a linear relationship between
the ventricular chamber elastance, but not the eﬀective
arterial elastance, and the Ees/Ea ratio in both Groups
1 and 2 is explored in the study (Figs. 2 and 3). The
real reasons for explaining the results are not so clear
that further investigation is required. Determined as the
pressure–volume area, the stroke work produced by the

1. Introduction
Electrical impedance cardiography has become useful in the assessment of cardiac parameters
(such as ventricular filling, contractility, cardiac output, stroke volume, and so forth),
including (1) to measure tissue activities without penetration, (2) to utilize common
ECG surface electrodes with no special transducers, (3) to have short response time and
(4) not to interfere with the measured sources (Ackmann and Seitz 1984, Woltjer et al 1996,
Shyu et al 2000).
There are three kinds of impedance technologies for non-invasively measuring cardiac
output. First, whole-body electrical impedance cardiography (WIC) requires four pairs of
electrodes that are applied to four limbs (Kubicek et al 1974, Leitman et al 2006), or requires
two pairs of electrodes in which one pair is placed on a wrist and the other on the contralateral
ankle (Cotter et al 2006), or requires only a pair of electrodes in which one electrode is
applied to the wrist and the other to the ankle (Cotter et al 2004). Second, thoracic electrical
impedance cardiography (TIC) is most commercially available. This approach needs a number
of electrodes placed separately at the base of the neck and set around the lower part of
the chest cage (Atallah and Demain 1995, Hahn et al 1995, Imhoff et al 2000). Third,
regional electrical impedance cardiography (RIC) usually utilizes two current electrodes and
two sensing electrodes that are placed on a local or regional position of a limb (Cohen et al
1998, Peng et al 2004, Critchley et al 2005).
The purpose of the investigation is to compare the absolute value of, the change in, and
the per cent change in electrical impedance waves from a forearm to those in cardiac output
and stroke volume measured with echocardiography.
2. Methods
2.1. The trial
The experimental population includes 13 male subjects with an average age of 22.3 ± 0.6 years,
systolic blood pressure of 132.7 ± 10.7 (from 112 to 151) mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of
76.7 ± 7.1 (from 69 to 89) mmHg, and heart rate of 79.5 ± 12.0 (from 61 to 92) beats per
min. In order to induce a change in the cardiac output, all subjects were asked to undertake
a 30 s breath-hold experiment in supine position. The Institutional Ethics Committee of the
Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital approved the study protocol and all subjects gave their
consent.
2.2. Regional impedance cardiography
A tetra-polar device that was capable of measuring forearm impedance was constructed in
the study. Figure 1 shows the device’s block diagram for recording the regional impedance
waveform from the left forearm of the subjects in supine position. A pair of current electrodes
(positions 1 and 4) (ECG electrodes, Unomedical Ltd, Great Britain) was excited by an ac
constant current source of less than 1 mA with a frequency of around 100 kHz, and the
voltage drop between the two sensing electrodes (positions 2 and 3) was picked up by an
instrumentation amplifier with high input impedance. Position 1 is close to the wrist, position
4 is close to the arm bent, and positions 2 and 3 are 2–3 cm apart from the corresponding
positions 1 and 4, respectively.
A twin T band-rejection filter was used to reduce the 60 Hz noise from the power line, and a
full-wave rectifying modulator was added to rectify the alternating signal. Besides, each band-

2.5. Statistical analysis
The quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD. If a p value is less than 0.05 using the
paired t-test, then the means of two variables measured before and just after the breath-hold
maneuver are considered significantly different. To compare the changes and per cent changes
in the maximum amplitude and the area of impedance waveform with those in the stroke
volume and cardiac output, 2-tailed Pearson’s correlation was used.
3. Results
With the proposed device, the maximum amplitude of the regional impedance waveform and
the average area under the impedance curve from the 13 subjects are summarized in table 1.
We found that most subjects’ maximum impedance amplitudes were increased just after the
30 s breath-hold test, as compared to the control. As well, we found that the peak amplitude
obtained just after the breath-hold experiment was significantly increased over that obtained
in baseline ( p < 0.003). In addition, the area per second underneath the impedance waveform
just after the 30 s breath hold was significantly enlarged, as compared with that in the steady
state ( p < 0.02).
Table 2 lists the cardiac output, stroke volume, EDV and ESV measured with 2D
echocardiography from the 13 subjects before and just after the 30 s breath-hold maneuver. No
significant difference appeared between the EDVs measured before and after the breath-hold

4. Discussion
Although several investigators have demonstrated the potential usefulness of whole body or the
thoracic impedance cardiography in the evaluation of cardiac output in patients with different
diseases or clinical situations (Adamicza et al 1994, Cohen et al 1998, Paredes et al 2006),
apparently, the two approaches utilize multiple pairs of electrodes and consume more time
to correctly place them on specific positions. Thus, the forearm impedance cardiography
proposed in the study seems to be more convenient and practical in setting the electrodes on
the lower part of a limb for actual clinical environments.
According to the Kirchhoff’s law, electrical current passes preferentially through human
tissue of higher conductance. When an alternating current of 100 kHz is applied to the

2004). Due to the fact that the blood pressure follows the blood flow in an artery and the
electrical impedance varies inversely and dominantly with the blood flow, the delta Z is likely
to be nonlinearly pressure dependent. To confirm, in the present study, whether the electrical
impedance waveform recorded from the forearm coincides with the pulsatile blood flow of
the radial artery, we put an air cuff around the upper arm and observe the impedance signals
in response to the different pressurized cuffs. When the cuff pressure is increased to about 60
mmHg, the blood flow in the most veins inside the upper arm is probably occluded, leading
to little change in the amplitude of the electrical impedance signal measured in the lower arm.
But, when the cuff is inflated to the mean arterial pressure for each subject and the brachial
artery underlying is partially occluded, a moderate reduction in the impedance amplitude is

A number of factors may affect the measurement of the impedance amplitude in the
lower arm. One important factor is associated with the arm geometry. Obviously, there are
different arm diameters among the subjects (Van de Water et al 2003) that will considerably
influence the calculation of cardiac output using a generalized formula. Another factor is
the interpersonal variability in muscle anisotropy that will change the mean value of muscle
conductivity and in turn have an effect on the impedance recording. In the present study,
the impedance waveform registered is under the assumption that the muscle and the blood
conductivities beneath the sensing electrodes are constants. Since this study focuses on the
correlation between the change in the impedance amplitude and the change in stroke volume,
the effect of muscle anisotropy on the impedance amplitude might be considered to be reduced.
Nevertheless, further investigation on the arm geometry and non-uniform conductivities is
needed for applying the results of the present work to a fixed formula mode of measurement.
Apparently, in this approach by introducing the concept of per cent changes in the stroke
volume and cardiac output, we notice a good result to assess the cardiac pumping performance
by measuring the regional electrical impedance waveform.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, electrical impedance cardiography from the lower arms can be applied to not
only observe the radial blood flow, but to assess the fluctuation in cardiac output or in stroke
volume on a continuous and long-term basis.

Abstract—We propose three cardiac size-normalized 
contractility indexes in the work to investigate whether left 
ventricular (LV) systolic function in patients with acute 
myocardial infraction (AMI) after thrombolysis is 
enhanced or not.  A cohort of 18 patients (17 men) aged 
45–72 years received thrombolytic therapy within 24 hours 
after an AMI event, and their LV chamber function was 
determined using pressure-volume loops obtained by 
simultaneous conductance catheter volumetry and 
micromanometer pressure during catheterization 
examination at the first week and 3 months, respectively.  
A slope of the end-systolic pressure volume relation (Ees) 
was derived by reduced venous return. Three new 
contractility indexes (Esv, Edv, and Emv) were defined as 
the Ees divided by the end-systolic volume, end-diastolic 
and midrange of the LV volume, and then normalized to 
100 ml, respectively. Using linear regression methods, we 
found high correlation coefficients of r = 0.835 at the first week 
and r = 0.826 at 3 months between the Ees and Esv after 
thrombolysis.  Furthermore, Esv and Emv but not Ees were 
significantly higher measured at 3 months than at the first week 
after thrombolytic intervention.  Thus, an increase in the volume-
normalized contractility measures Esv and Emv implies the 
improvement of the left ventricular systolic function in the post-
AMI human hearts long-term after thrombolytic treatment, in 
despite that there is a great coefficient of variation in cardiac 
chamber sizes at different recovery stages.

systolic pressure-volume relation(ESPVR); Ventricle; thrombolysis 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Contractility of a left ventricle not only characterizes its 
systolic function, but also is intimately associated with various 
heart diseases.  Thus, it is always necessary to search for a 
dependable measure for assessing ventricular contractility 
either in a normal or diseased state.  Suga and Sagawa have 
successfully demonstrated a left ventricular (LV) contractility 
index that is determined with the slope (Ees) of the end-
systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) [1-3].  Up to now, 
the Ees is considered to be the most frequently used index as 
the LV contractility, due to its preload- and afterload-
independence, and sensitivity to changes in the inotropic state 
[2,4]. 
A number of investigations have shown that the Ees cannot 
be kept constant as a great change in LV preload or afterload 
is imposed [5,6].  In addition, higher LV end-systolic 
elastance is shown in small hearts of animals than in human 
hearts [7,8].  The LV contractility represented by Ees may 
possibly depend on the size of a LV chamber [9,10].  In other 
words, the Ees may become a size-dependent contractility 
index.    
Remodeling and deformation of LV configuration may 
take place in human hearts with acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) [11,12].  It is thus essential to elucidate whether the 
systolic functin in human hearts with post-AMI improves or 
not, after instantly thrombolytic intervention. Therefore, the 
purpose of the present study is to propose three chamber 
contractility measures normalized to distinct LV volumes  and 
compare them with the traditional contractility indicator Ees, 
and to apply the new indexes for evaluating whether the LV 
systolic function in post-AMI patients after thrombolytic 
therapy is enhanced or not. 
II. METHODS 
A. Experimental Protocol 
The study recruited eighteen AMI patients (17 men and 1 
woman, averaged 66 ± 6 years) who underwent thrombolytic 
intervention intravenously in the first 24 hours after event at 
the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

week in the 18 patients with post-AMI.  In these patients, the 
conventional contractility Ees, with no significant change, was 
higher at 3 months than at the 1st week after the thrombolysis. 
Similarly, the three volume-normalized contractility measrues, 
Esv, Edv and Emv, tended to be increased in the 3-month 
post-AMI condition, as compared with those at the 1st week 
after thrombolytic therapy.   In addition, both Esv and Emv 
became significantly greater at 3 months than at the 1st week 
after the AMI event.   
As shown from Fig. 2 to Fig. 4, linear relationships are 
found between the traditional contractility determined using the 
ESPVR and the volume-normalized contractility measures. 
Correlation coefficients calculated using the linear regression 
method between the Ees and one of the Esv, Edv and Emv, are 
0.835 (p < 0.002), 0.936 (p < 0.0001) and 0.909  (p < 0.0001) 
at the first week, and 0.826 (p < 0.001), 0.859 (p < 0.001) and 
0852 (p < 0.0001) at 3 months after thrombolysis, respectively.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, Ees, 
has been regularly used as an index for the ventricular 
contractility, based on its inotropy-sensitive, and preload- and 
afterload-independent properties [2,3].  However, a limitation 
of the slope is that it decreases progressively as ventricular size 
increases without this change necessarily indicating a change in 
contractile state [13]. Moreover, previous studies have 
demonstrated that hearts of smaller animals own a larger value 
of that contractility index, while larger-size human or animal 
hearts have conversely smaller Ees [7,8]. A	

Abstract—In the study, we assessed the change in the left 
ventricular stroke volume from a radial artery by using an 
electrical impedance plethysmographic device.  This device 
mainly incorporated tetra-polar electrodes, two of which were 
excited by an ac constant current source, and the other two are 
the sensing electrodes. In theory, the voltage difference between 
the two sensing electrodes was inversely proportional to the 
radial arterial blood flow of interest.  In order to alter the stroke 
volume, 13 volunteers were recruited to undertake a thirty-
second breath-hold maneuver. It was found that the impedance 
waveform registered in the lower arm had a significantly higher 
amplitude (2.24 ± 0.43 Volts) just after the 30-second breath-hold 
than in the steady state (1.81 ± 0.47 Volts) (p<0.001).  In addition, 
a linear regression coefficient of 0.85 was found between the 
change in the stroke volume measured by a 2-D ultrasound 
system, and the change in the impedance amplitude before and 
after the breath-hold maneuver. In conclusion, we may non-
invasively and continuously monitor the subject’s stroke volume 
via a peripheral artery by means of the electrical impedance 
plethysmography.  
Keywords- Impedance plethysmography, Stroke volume, 
Breath-hold, Impedance, Radial artery 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Non-invasively plethysmographic methods for 
monitoring the peripheral arterial blood flow are helpful in 
clinical applications. These methods include the venous 
occlusion volume, the limb weight gain, the strain gauge, the 
Doppler ultrasound, the photo-plethysmography, the 
oscillometry, the tonometry, the electromagnetic method, and 
the     electrical impedance plethysmography [1-4].  
    With the following advantages, the electrical impedance 
plethysmography have become useful in the measurement of 
arterial blood flow, including the measurement of tissue 
activities without penetration, the usage of common ECG 
surface electrodes with no special transducers, the short 
response time, and the non-interfering measured sources due 
to tiny electrodes [5-8].   
    Thus, the purpose of the study is to develop a device for 
continuously monitoring the change in the radial arterial 
segment volume by using the electrical impedance 
plethysmography, and to compare the device’s voltage output 
with the stroke volume measured with an ultrasound system. 
II. METHODS 
A. Plethysmographic Device 
A device that was capable of measuring radial blood flow 
using the impedance plethysmography was constructed in the 
study.  Fig. 1 shows the schematic block diagram of the 
device. A pair of current electrodes was excited by an ac 
constant current source (1mA, 100 kHz) and the voltage drop 
between the two sensing electrodes was picked up by an 
instrumentation amplifier. To obtain the blood flow-induced 
impedance signal, two band-pass filters were utilized to get rid 
of the undesired components of higher frequencies. 
B. Experimental Protocol 
The experimental population includes thirteen volunteers 
with an average age of 22.3 ± 0.6 years, systolic blood 
pressure of 132.7 ± 10.7 (from 112 to 151) mmHg, diastolic 
blood pressure of 76.7 ± 7.1 (from 69 to 89) mmHg, and heart 
rate of 79.5 ± 12.0 (from 61 to 92) beats per minute. The 
subjects were asked to undergo a 30-second breath-hold 
experiment.  For each subjects, the radial blood flow is 
continuously recorded by the present tetra-polar device using 
impedance plethysmography.  Based on the ECG signals, the 
left ventricular end-systolic (ESV) and end-diastolic (EDV) 
volumes were determined by a 2-D ultrasound system 
(SONOS-7500, Philips). These measurements were performed

IV. DISCUSSION 
In spite of its potential usefulness in the evaluation of 
stroke volume in patients with different diseases, the whole-
body or the thoracic impedance cardiography requires multiple 
pairs of electrodes and consumes more time to correctly place 
them on specific positions [9,10].  Thus, the forearm 
impedance cardiography proposed in the study seems to be 
more convenient and practical in setting the electrodes on the 
lower part of a limb for actual clinical environments. 
In this study, we apply an alternating current of 100 KHz 
to ring-type current electrodes placed directly on top of the 
radial artery, which may produce a high current density in the 
radial lumen.  Thus, the change in the forearm impedance 
amplitude may vary constantly with the change in the radial 
blood flow. This suggests that the change in the impedance 
amplitude can be more specifically reflected the change in the 
stroke volume. 
Many factors may affect the measurement of the 
impedance amplitude in the lower arm, such as the arm 
geometry and the interpersonal variability in muscle 
anisotropy [11].  In the present study, the impedance 
waveform registered is under the assumption that the muscle 
and the blood conductivities beneath the sensing electrodes are 
constants.  Since this study focuses on the correlation between 
the change in the impedance amplitude and the change in 
stroke volume, the effect of the muscle anisotropy on the 
impedance amplitude might be small.  However, further 
investigation on the arm geometry and non-uniform 
conductivities is needed for applying the results of the present 
work to a fixed formula mode of measurement. 
One of the most important drawbacks for the impedance 
plethysmographic device developed is pretty sensitive to the 
motion artifact and other muscle activities.  For instance, 
although an artifact source distal to the measuring position still 
affects the impedance signal.  
 
V. CONCLUSION 
    The proposed plethysmographic device can be applied to 
long-term and continuously register the regional electrical 
impedance waveform.  The change in amplitude of the 
impedance waveform is found to closely reflect the change in 
ventricular stroke volume. Apparently, it suggests that the good 
result in the study be helpful in assessing the cardiac pumping 
performance by measuring the regional electrical impedance 
waveform.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of the study was to measure radial 
arterial elastance under a pressurized upper arm 
condition wtih a self-designed apparatus. With the 
apparatus, the arterial wall was stimulated by a 
minute sinusoidal displacement with various 
frequencies (40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 80, and 85 Hz) in 
eighteen subjects. Based on the linear relationship 
between the responsive contact force (Y-axis) and 
square angular frequency (X-axis), the wall 
elastance could be identical to the intercept of the 
Y-axis.  
In the eighteen subjects, the dynamic range of 
the radial wall elastance was found to be between 
0.705×106 and 3.778×106 dyne/cm, and the average 
of maximum elastance was 1.879×106 ± 0.854×106 
dyne/cm in baseline conditions. As an air cuff 
around one upper arm was pressurized to 10 mmHg 
over the subject’s diastolic pressure, the dynamic 
radial wall elastance varied from 1.243×106 to 
6.557×106 dyne/cm, and the average of maximum 
elastance became 3.017×106 ± 1.779×106 dyne/cm 
for the eighteen subjects. In addition, the dynamic 
curve of the radial wall elastance computed in this 
study resembled radial blood pressure waveform on 
the whole.

五、討論 
 
在實驗中因每位受試者的橈動脈深淺度不
一，位置也不一，且皮下組織的成份及厚度也有
所不同，所以目前較須加強的部份就是該如何訂
出橈動脈量測的標準位置，及尋找較適當的手腕
靠墊，藉由較專業的靠墊可以使受試者的手部較
為舒適，且量測時位置能較為一致。而目前是以
人工方式去感受受試者較為明顯之橈動脈脈動
處，再根據螢幕上所顯示的橈動脈反應波形大小
及波形形狀來決定量測的位置及壓迫深度，在未
來我們是傾向於先利用壓張式血壓量測系統找出
較佳的橈動脈量測位置，隨後再以微振動血管硬
度量測系統進行量測。 
在上臂加壓實驗方面，本是希望以受試者的
平均動脈壓(MAP)來作為氣囊加壓之標準，但在
測量後受試者均表示加壓30秒後手部會有不適的
現象，因此在最後上臂加壓實驗的氣囊壓壓力值
調整為高於受試者血壓舒張壓 10mmHg 之壓力，
且效果在大多受試者的數據呈現上是可接受的，
但有部分的受試者是不適用的，所以未來會在以
不影響反應波形下，受試者所能承受的壓力值來
做為上臂加壓實驗的壓力值。最後，在本系統的
量測結果中，有幾位受試者的資料是完全無法參
考分析的，對此在將來可能還需要再找出一套更
完善的量測模式與程序(能輕鬆量測所有人的方
式)，並固定各階段的量測時間，減少誤差的產
生，以提高數據的可用性。 
依據人體生理學，在阻斷靜脈的回流後(動脈
未完全受阻)，血液會開始充滿其他血管使血管擴
張，此時血管的抗彈性力應該會較大。而從實驗
結果裡發現，在 18 組可供分析的數據中有 16 組
的數據是與此理論相同的[上臂加壓實驗下動脈
抗彈性力 > 常態下動脈抗彈性力]，但是其中有 2
組數據結果是與此理論相反的[常態下動脈抗彈
性力 > 上臂加壓實驗下動脈抗彈性力]。因此，
本研究目前所提出之合理看法為，每個人的生理
構造都不會完全相同，就算是身高體重相似，但
在其外觀下身體組織的構成與位置卻是有許多的
差異性，且每位受試者本身的身材與身體條件均
不相同，因此我們推斷可能的理由是，由於受試
者血管靜脈的位置可能位於皮下較深處，因此，
當我們阻斷氣囊壓設定為高於受試者血壓舒張壓
10mmHg 時，並不是所有的受試者靜脈都會遭到
完全阻斷，有些受試者的靜脈可能還是會有血液
回流的動作，所以當我們把臂動脈血量減少時，
部份靜脈還是處於有血液回流的情況下，也導致
血管的抗彈性力會較常態下來的小，使得實驗結
果產生誤差。且由於目前的實驗數據實是不足，
尚無法訂定出正常人血管硬度的標準，所以在將
來勢必要增加本研究的量測人數。 
實驗結果的整體趨勢與我們的公式推導都是
相當的接近，我們可以從在一個時間點中力與位
移量在不同頻率的關係中，經由線性迴歸分析得
到一線性方程式，而方程式的截距即是我們所需
要的值：橈動脈的抗彈性力(E)，而斜率的絕對值
則是相對質量(M)，此相對質量在理論上應該為一
定值，並不會隨著時間的變動而有所改變，但是
在實際分析中，所求得的線性方程式之斜率還是
會有些微的變化，但其變化量相當的小(只有千分
之幾的變化量，如表二所示) ，故我們可以將相
對質量視為一定值。

Abstract 
 
The purpose of the work is to derive in theory 
the time-varying arterial elastance with the minute 
vibration principle.  First, based on the minute 
vibration theory, we can directly compute a 
time-invariant elastance of the medium tissue that is 
present between the measuring probe and arterial 
wall, as well as the corresponding effective mass of 
interest. Second, there are two kinds of tissue, the 
medium tissue and the arterial wall tissue, in actual 
situation.  The combined time-varying elastance 
and the effective mass corresponding to the two 
tissues can be theoretically derived by the vibration 
principle.  Reasonably, the effect of the viscous 
components on the measured force may be neglected 
for those connective tissues.  Here, the densities of 
the two tissues are also assumed to be equal.  It 
may be accepted that the time-varying arterial wall 
elastance is reasonably proportional to the combined 
elstance.  Thus, according to the above derivation, 
we can obtain a relative time-varying arterial 
elastance.  That will be helpful in analyzing the 
elastance-related recording data by the minute 
vibration method

On Calculating the Time-Varying Elastance Curve of a Radial Artery 
Using a Miniature Vibration Method

Abstract — We examined the time-varying elastance of the 
radial arterial wall using a minute vibration approach in fif-
teen volunteers. A sinusoidal displacement of 1.5~2.0 mm with 
a frequency range from 50 to 100 Hz was used to impose on the 
superficial radial artery.  Meanwhile, a force sensor was used 
to pick up the contact force exerted by the radial arterial wall.  
The amplitude of the complex force was found to be negatively 
proportional to the squared angular frequency imposed on the 
radial artery.  A linear regression line can be obtained using 
the different frequencies (x-axis) and their force responses (y-
axis). The intercept of the regression line with the y-axis de-
notes the elastance and the slope the effective contact mass.  
Ten elastance values corresponding to 10 different timings in a 
cardiac cycle were used to construct a time-varying elastance 
curve.  It was found that the elastance curve fundamentally 
follows the arterial pressure waveform.  In conclusion, we have 
successfully calculated the arterial elastance values at various 
cardiac timings by applying the minute vibration method, and 
the pattern of the elastance curve bears a resemblance to a 
blood pressure waveform.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In addition to aging, several kinds of disease result in 
vascular hardening, such as the cerebral vessel disease [1], 
cardiovascular disease [2], diabetes mellitus [3] and renal 
disease [4].  Thus, it is important to perform an early detec-
tion of the arterial stiffness using a reliable method. To date, 
there have been different technologies for directly or indi-
rectly assessing the arterial stiffness, including the ultra-
sound echo-tracking (Doppler)[5], analysis of pulse transit 
time[6], impedance plethysomgraphy [7], photo-
plethysmography [8], oscillometry [9], tonometry [10],  and 
analysis of pressure waveform [11]. 
Up to now, there is no reliable way to evaluate the degree 
of the arterial stiffness (elastance) in the clinical setting. 
Thus, the purpose of this thesis is to develop a noninvasive 
apparatus for measuring the arterial wall properties by 
means of minute vibration technique, and to calculate the 
time-varying arterial elastance curve. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A measurement system consisting mainly of a micro-
vibration generator, a force-sensing device, an analog-to-
digital and digital-to-analog converters, and a personal 
computer was constructed to calculate radial arterial time-
varying elastance curve using the minute vibration method.  
Characteristics of arterial wall were assumed to be gov-
erned by three components, including the inertia, viscosity, 
and elastance [12]. Furthermore, the force exerted by the 
inertia component was denoted by the product of mass (M) 
and acceleration (d2x/dt2), the force induced by the viscosity 
component was equal to the product of blood viscosity (η) 
and velocity (dx/dt), and the force generated by the elas-
tance component was represented by the product of elas-
tance (E) and displacement (x).  According to the concept of 
force balance, an external force imposed on the arterial wall 
should equal to the sum of the forces from the three compo-
nents [12], as follows: 
Ex
dt
dx
dt
xdMF ++= η
2
2
  (1) 
The viscosity term is relatively very small, as compared 
with the other two force terms. After neglecting the viscos-
ity term, we can obtain  
Ex
dt
xdMF +≈ 2
2
  (2) 
If a sinusoidal displacement is imposed on the arterial 
wall, then relation between the complex contact force and 
the angular frequency can be represented by 
)()()( 2 ηωωω jMEF +−=   (3) 
From Eq. (3), the real part of the complex contact force is 
inversely proportional to squared angular frequency (ω2).  
Thus, if we make a plot using the real part of the contact 
force (vertical axis) with respect to ω2 (horizontal axis). By 
exciting the arterial wall with a small and different-
frequency sinusoidal displacement, a regression line can be 
obtained. Thus, the intercept of the vertical axis with the 
regression line corresponds to the wall elastance and the 
inverse of the slope of the regression line is equivalent to 
the effective mass of the arterial contact wall.
