Abstract 
This work studies the natural convection heat transfer from an inclined wavy plate in a bi-disperse 
porous medium with uniform wall temperature. The two-velocity two-temperature formulation is used 
to derive the governing equations of this system. The Prandtl coordinate transformation is used to 
transform the wavy surface into a regular plane, and the obtained equations are then simplified further 
by the order-of-magnitude analysis to give the boundary layer equations. The cubic spline collocation 
method is used to solve the boundary layer governing equations. The effects of dimensionless 
amplitude, angle of inclination, inter-phase heat transfer parameter, modified thermal conductivity ratio, 
permeability ratio on the heat transfer and flow characteristics are studied. Increasing the modified 
thermal conductivity ratio, the permeability ratio or the inclination angle can effectively enhance the 
natural convection heat transfer of the inclined plate in bi-disperse porous media. Moreover, the 
inter-phase heat transfer parameter has significant effect on the state of thermal non-equlibrium 
between the p-phase and the f-phase of the bi-disperse porous medium. As the dimensionless amplitude 
increases, both the fluctuations of the local Nusselt number for the f-phase and the p-phase with the 
streamwise coordinate are enhanced. 
 
Keywords: Natural convection, Bidisperse porous medium, Inclined wavy plate, Heat transfer,

1. Introduction 
Coupled heat and mass transfer in fluid-saturated porous media has been of growing interest 
during the last several decades because of its great practical applications in modern industry, such as 
the design of building components for energy consideration, control of pollutant spread in groundwater, 
compact heat exchangers, solar power collectors and food industries.  
Cheng and Minkowycz [1] studied the free convection from a vertical plate embedded in a porous 
medium with application to heat transfer from a dyke. Bejan and Khair [2] studied the heat and mass 
transfer by natural convection in a porous medium. Cheng et al. [3] studied the natural convection heat 
transfer of a Darcian fluid about a cone. Nakayama and Hossain [4] studied the combined heat and 
mass transfer by natural convection in a porous medium by integral methods. Cheng [5] studied the 
effect of a magnetic field on heat and mass transfer by natural convection from vertical surfaces in 
porous media by an integral approach. Yih [6] examined the coupled heat and mass transfer by free 
convection over a truncated cone in porous media for variable wall temperature and concentration or 
variable heat and mass fluxes. Rees and Pop [7] studied the vertical free convective boundary-layer flow in a

 The fluid properties are assumed to be constant except for density variations in the buoyancy

3. Results and discussion 
The transformed governing equations, Eqs. (29) and (30), and the associated boundary conditions, 
Eqs. (31) and (32), can be solved by the cubic spline collocation method [23]. The velocities f ′  and 
g ′  are calculated from the momentum equations, Eqs. (27) and (28). Moreover, the Simpson’s rule for 
variable grids is used to calculate the values of f and g at every position from the boundary conditions, 
Eqs. (31) and (32). At every position, the iteration process continues until the convergence criterion for 
all the variables, 610 − , is achieved. Variable grids with 300 grid points are used in the η -direction. 
The optimum value of boundary layer thickness is used. The backward finite difference is used to 
calculate the derivative about the streamwise coordinateξ .  To assess the accuracy of the solution, the 
present results are compared with the results obtained by other researchers. Table 1 shows the 
numerical values of 
0=′− ηθmp  for natural convection heat transfer of a vertical smooth plate in 
mono-disperse porous media with constant wall temperature. It is shown that the present results are in 
excellent agreement with the results reported by Cheng and Minkowycz [1] and Rees and Pop [7].  
Fig. 3 shows the effect of the permeability ratio Kr on the local Nusselt numbers for the f-phase 
8 
 
numbers for the f-phase 5.0−xf RaNu  and the p-phase 5.0−xp RaNu increase with the modified thermal 
conductivity ratio γ . The heat transfer rate for the bidisperse porous medium can be effectively 
enhanced by raising the modified thermal conductivity ratio. 
Fig. 9 shows the effect of the inclination angle A on the local Nusselt number for the f-phase 
5.0−
xf RaNu  and the p-phase 5.0−xp RaNu  for a=0, H=1, 0001.0=rK , 1=β , 1.0=γ , 01.0=σ , 4.0=φ , 
4.0=ε and 625.0=τ . For a smooth plate, increasing the inclination angle A tends to increase both the 
local Nusselt number for the f-phase 5.0−xf RaNu  and local Nusselt number for the p-phase 5.0−xp RaNu . 
This means that the heat transfer rate for the bidisperse porous medium can be effectively enhanced by 
raising the inclination angle A. 
Fig. 10 shows the effect of the inclination angle A on the local Nusselt number for the f-phase 
5.0−
xf RaNu  and the p-phase 5.0−xp RaNu  for a=0.2, H=1, 0001.0=rK , 1=β , 1.0=γ , 01.0=σ , 
4.0=φ , 4.0=ε and 625.0=τ . As the inclination angle A increases, both the fluctuations of the local 
Nusselt number for the f-phase 5.0−xf RaNu  and the p-phase 5.0−xp RaNu  with the streamwise coordinate 
ξ  become smller.  
Fig. 11 shows the effect of the dimensionless amplitude a on the local Nusselt number for the 
f-phase and the p-phase for 3/π=A , H=1, 0001.0=rK , 1=β , 1.0=γ , 01.0=σ , 4.0=φ , 
4.0=ε and 625.0=τ . As the inclination angle a increases, both the fluctuations of the local Nusselt 
number for the f-phase 5.0−xf RaNu  and the p-phase 5.0−xp RaNu  with the streamwise coordinate ξ  are 
enhanced. Moreover, the values of the local Nusselt numbers for the f-phase 5.0−xf RaNu  are higher 
than those for the p-phase 5.0−xp RaNu .  
 
4. Conclusions 
This work studies the natural convection heat transfer from an inclined wavy plate in a bi-disperse 
porous medium with constant wall temperature by using the two-velocity two-temperature model to 
derive the governing equations of this system. The Prandtl coordinate transformation is used to 
transform the wavy surface into a regular plane, and the obtained equations are then simplified further 
by the order-of-magnitude analysis to give the boundary layer equations. The cubic spline collocation 
method is used to solve the boundary layer equations. The effects of dimensionless amplitude, angle of 
inclination, inter-phase heat transfer parameter, modified thermal conductivity ratio, permeability ratio 
on the natural heat transfer characteristics are studied. Results show that higher values of the modified 
thermal conductivity ratio, the permeability ratio and the inclination angle can effectively enhance the 
natural convection heat transfer of the inclined plate in bi-disperse porous media. Moreover, the 
inter-phase heat transfer parameter has significant effect on the state of thermal non-equlibrium 
between the p-phase and the f-phase of the bi-disperse porous medium. As the inclination angle 
increases, both the fluctuations of the local Nusselt number for the f-phase and the p-phase with the 
streamwise coordinate are enhanced.

the boundary condition of variable wall temperature 
and concentration. This work studies the heat and 
mass transfer characteristics of natural convection 
from an arbitrarily inclined plate in a fluid saturated 
porous medium with variable wall temperature and 
concentration. The governing equations are 
transformed into a set of coupled differential 
equations, and the obtained boundary layer 
equations are solved by the cubic spline collocation 
method [13, 14]. The heat and mass transfer 
characteristics are presented as functions of surface 
temperature exponent, surface concentration 
exponent, inclination variable, Lewis number, and 
buoyancy ratio.  
 
 
2 Problem Formulation 
Consider the boundary layer flow driven by natural 
convection with temperature and concentration 
gradients above a semi-infinite plate embedded in a 
porous medium saturated with a Newtonian fluid. 
This plate is above the horizontal and is inclined at 
an angle A ( oo 900 ≤≤ A ) to the horizontal. The 
surface of the inclined plate is maintained at a 
constant temperature wT  greater than the porous 
medium temperature ∞T  sufficiently far from the 
inclined plate. The concentration of a certain

medium varies from a higher concentration wC  on 
the fluid side of the surface of the inclined plate to a 
lower concentration ∞C  sufficiently far from the 
inclined plate.  
Based on the boundary layer and Boussinesq 
approximations, we can write the governing 
equations for boundary layer Darcy flow by natural 
convection of a Newtonian fluid embedded in a 
porous medium near an arbitrarily inclined plate in 
two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates ( ), yx  as

3  Problem Solution 
The transformed governing differential equations, 
Eqs. (10)-(12), and the associated boundary 
conditions, Eqs. (14)-(15), can be solved by the 
cubic spline collocation method [13, 14]. At every 
position, the iteration process continues until the 
convergence criterion for all the variables, 610− , is 
achieved. Variable grids are used in the η -direction. 
Moreover, uniform grids are used in the ξ - 
direction. The optimum value of boundary layer 
thickness is used. In order to access the accuracy of 
the solution, the results reported in this work are 
compared with the results obtained by other authors.

Table 1 shows the values of ( )0,ξθ ′−  and  
( )0,ξφ ′−  for 1=ξ , 0=n , and 0=m , the 
conditions for heat and mass transfer of vertical 
surfaces in porous media with constant wall 
temperature and concentration. The results obtained 
by the present method are in excellent agreement 
with the results reported by Bejan and Khair [2].  
Figs. 1 and 2 plot the variation the local Nusselt

Sherwood number 311 )cos()1( −−+ ARaRSh with 
the inclination variable ξ  for various values of 
buoyancy ratio N with Le=3, n=0.5 and m=0.5. 
Higher buoyancy ratio leads to higher flow 
velocities, thinning the thermal and concentration 
boundary layers and thus increasing the heat and 
mass transfer rates between the fluid and the wall.

inclination variable ξ  for various values of surface 
concentration exponent m with Le=3, N=2 and 
m=0.5. It is clearly shown in Fig. 7 that the effect of 
the surface concentration exponent on the local 
Nusselt number is small. As the surface 
concentration exponent is increased, the local 
Sherwood number increases significantly, as shown 
in Fig. 8.  
 
 
4 Conclusion 
This work studies the heat and mass transfer 
characteristics of natural convection from an 
arbitrarily inclined plate in a fluid saturated porous 
medium with variable wall temperature and 
concentration. The governing equations are 
transformed into a set of coupled differential 
equations, and the obtained boundary layer 
equations are solved by the cubic spline collocation 
method. The heat and mass transfer characteristics 
are presented as functions of surface temperature 
exponent, surface concentration exponent, 
inclination variable, Lewis number, and buoyancy 
ratio. Results show that an increase in the Lewis 
number leads to a decrease the local Nusselt number 
and an increase in the Sherwood number. Moreover, 
increasing the buoyancy ratio tends to increase both 
the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood 
number. For the positive inclination, as the 
inclination variable increases, the local Nusselt 
number and the local Sherwood number first 
decrease, reach minima, and then increase. The 
minima are where the tangential and normal 
components of buoyancy force are comparable.
