TRL Calibration Technique for Asymmetrical 2-port and
3-port Devices (II)

Abstract
A TRL-based calibration technique is proposed to conduct S-parameter measurements on re-
ciprocal symmetrical three- and four-port devices using two-port vector network analyzers. The
technique takes the effects of reflections from an unmeasured port terminated with a nonideal
50-Ω load into consideration. These reflected signals cause errors in S-parameters measurements,
especially at higher frequencies where the reflections are too large to be ignored. The errors
have been overlooked in the traditional two-port TRL measurements for three- and four-port
devices. In this paper, analytical calibration equations are presented for symmetrical three- and
four-port devices to improve the accuracy of their S-parameter measurements. The improve-
ment is justified by comparing the data before/after applying the proposed technique with the
measured data from four-port vector network analyzers. In addition, error analysis is conducted
to ensure that the errors introduced by vector network analyzers would not be deteriorated by
the proposed calibration equations. The procedure for general three-port device calibration is
also proposed. The required formulas are also derived. However, experimental verification are
still needed to prove its usefulness.
1 Introduction
Printed circuit board (PCB) technology has been widely used to implement microwave circuits.
Comparing to traditional waveguides, it brings the benefits of light weight, low profile, ease
of production and, the most important of all, low cost. Especially nowadays due to the wide-
spread use of consumer wireless communication systems such as mobile phones and wireless data
networks, microwave circuits fabricated by PCB technology are getting more and more popular.
Among them, microstrip lines and coplanar waveguides (CPW) are the planar transmission
lines usually selected for circuit implementation on PCBs.
To measure the S-parameters of microwave circuits, vector network analyzers (VNAs) are the
testing instruments for this assignment. Typical VNAs are connected to the device under test
(DUT) by coaxial cables with a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. This creates two issues. First,
in order to connect the coaxial cable to the PCB circuit, a coaxial-to-microstrip or coaxial-to-
CPW adapter is required for the transition of the two different transmission lines. Second, the
measurement results include not only the frequency responses of the DUT, but also those from
the internal errors inside the VNA, the coaxial cables, the required adapters, and the planar
transmission lines connecting the adapters and the DUT, which seriously degrades the accuracy
of the measurements by VNAs. Therefore, calibration must be applied to the measurements to
seek for the true frequency responses of the DUT.
Before measuring the S-parameters of DUTs by a VNA, usually short-open-load calibration
(SOLT) [1] must be performed to remove the effects of the coaxial cables and the internal errors
inside the VNA. This technique derives the correction data by connecting open, short and 50
Ω terminations to the end of the coaxial cables. Therefore, after calibration, the characteristics
of the whole circuit assembly between the ends of the coaxial cables are computed. That is,
not only the DUT but also the planar transmission lines connected to the DUT and the coaxial
1
vices is derived. This new formualtion and derivation process is more succinct and expressive.
The resulting equations can be displayed not like those derived in the proposal. The formulas
were verified by Ansoft ADS successfully. However, we still have not succeeded in verifying it
experimentally. Finally, conclusion is given in Section 6.
2 Measuring Symmetrical Reciprocal 3-port Devices
by 2-port TRL Calibration
A TRL-based calibration technique is proposed to solve the aforementioned problems for the
S-parameter measurements of three-port devices using two-port VNAs. The overall effects of
the nonideal 50-Ω load, the adaptor, and the connecting transmission line are represented by
a reflection coefficient at a specified reference plane defined for the unmeasured port. This
reflection coefficient is characterized experimentally and taken in account in the derivation
of the expressions for the true S-parameters of three-port devices in terms of their measured
S-parameters from the traditional two-port TRL calibration. Three-port devices featuring full-
symmetry and half-symmetry are considered in this report because they are common microwave
circuits. Design examples are presented for the application of the proposed technique to two-
port S-parameter measurements. The improvement made by the proposed calibration technique
over the traditional two-port TRL calibration can be verified by comparing the data obtained
from both techniques to the measurement results from four-port VNAs. At the end, error
analysis must be conducted to ensure the noise introduced by VNAs maintained in the same
order before/after applying the calibration equations to qualify the proposed technique for the
applications of VNA-related measurements.
2.1 Characterization of Nonideal Terminations
To accurately measure the S-parameters of three-port devices by two-port VNAs, the influence
of the unmeasured port terminated with a nonideal 50-Ω load must be characterized. Fig. 1
shows a typical three-port device with Port 2 and Port 3 connected to a VNA and Port 1
terminated with a 50-Ω load for S-parameter measurements. A reference plane is selected for
each port to conduct the traditional two-port TRL measurements for three-port devices. Equal
distance is chosen between each port and its reference plane for ease of applying this calibration
technique. The measurement setup shown in Fig. 1 is prepared for measuring the S-parameters
related to Port 2 and Port 3. Then, Port 2 and Port 3 are in turn terminated with a 50-Ω load
to measure the S-parameters related to Port 1 and Port 3, Port 1 and Port 2, respectively. In an
ideal condition, the unmeasured port terminated with a perfectly matched 50-Ω load presents
no incident waves to the DUT. However, in reality, such ideal 50-Ω loads do not exist and ones
that are commercially available normally exhibit poor performance at high frequencies and cause
signal reflections. As to the adaptors for coaxial-to-planar transitions, though, the requirement
on impedance matching is met, the discontinuity in electromagnetic field distributions at the
transitions results in insertion loss and additional signal reflections. They become severe as
frequency increases [12]. Moreover, the phase-related errors caused by the transmission line
connecting the nonideal 50-Ω load and the DUT need to be corrected. These problems must be
solved in order to conduct accurate S-parameter measurements.
To characterize these errors individually would be time-consuming and impractical, instead,
the reflection coefficient from the reference plane selected for the unmeasured port is chosen
to count for the overall influence of these errors on S-parameter measurements. This reflection
coefficient is characterized experimentally as follows. First, the calibration kit prepared for two-
port TRL measurements is employed to calculate the error boxes defined by reference planes.
Then, the Thru standard terminated with a nonideal 50-Ω load is connected to a VNA for S11
measurements, as shown in Fig. 2. After applying the TRL calibration scheme, the calibrated
S11 becomes the reflection coefficient from the reference plane selected for the unmeasured port
terminated with a nonideal 50-Ω load. The RO4003C PCB was chosen to implement the three-
port circuits for this study and the TRL calibration kid. The substrate has a dielectric constant

The expressions for other measured S-parameters with Port 2 and Port 3 being the unmea-
sured port, respectively, can be treated in the same way. The results are listed below,

In (8)–(16), Sk˜ij (i, j = 1, 2, 3) are the measured Sij of the three-port device with Port k
(k = 1, 2, 3) terminated with a nonideal 50-Ω load. Sij (i, j = 1, 2, 3) are the true S-parameters
to be determined. To solve the nine unknowns through these nine nonlinear equations above
would be extremely difficult. The reciprocal nature of the three-port device requires S12 = S21,
S13 = S31, and S23 = S32, which reduce the number of the unknowns down to six for the nine
equations below,
S1˜22 = S22 +

. (25)
More reduction in the number of unknowns from (17)–(25) can be achieved by utilizing the
property of symmetry in the circuits of three-port devices. Analytical expressions for the desired
true S-parameters in terms of the measured S-parameters by two-port VNAs are derived for
three-port devices with full- and half-symmetric properties. They are discussed in the following
subsections.
2.2.1 Full-symmetric Three-port Devices
The symmetric property of full-symmetric three-port devices forces S11 = S22 = S33 and S12
= S13 = S23. The number of unknowns is reduced down to two, S11 and S12. Their analytical
expressions in terms of the measured quantities, S3˜
11
, S3˜
12
, and Γ, can be derived from (23) and
5
Substituting S12 and S11 in (29) with their expressions in (34) and (35) yields the analytical
form for the third S-parameter, S13,
S13 =

− 1
. (36)
The last parameter S33 can be treated similarly by replacing S11 and S13 in (30) with with their
expressions in (35) and (36) and is given by
S33 =

. (37)
For the case with an ideal termination for the unmeasured port, S12 = S
3˜
12, S11 = S22 = S
2˜
11,
S13 = S
2˜
13
, and S33 = S
2˜
33
after applying Γ = 0 to (34)–(37). These four equations can work
equally well for the full-symmetric structures simply by setting S2˜11 = S
3˜
11 = S
2˜
33 and S
2˜
13 = S

Then, (26) can be deduced from (35) and (37), and similarly (27) from (34) and (36).
2.3 Applications for Two-port Measurements on Three-port De-
vices
In this section, measurements on three-port design examples are conducted to demonstrate the
improvement made by the proposed calibration technique over the traditional two-port TRL
technique. With the measured data obtained from three-port TRL measurements by four-port
VNAs as references, the data measured from the traditional two-port TRL calibration are in
comparison with the ones after applying the proposed calibration technique to them. Only one
calibration kit is employed throughout the entire study. They are used for the two- and three-
port TRL measurements to remove the errors introduced by the adaptors and transmission lines
between the adaptors and the DUT. Two Line standards are prepared to minimize the phase
errors that would occur in the wide frequency span, 1–20 GHz. The Thru standard offers another
function to characterize the reflections from the reference plane defined for unmeasured port
with a nonideal termination. No additional calibration standard is required for the proposed
calibration technique.
The Y-junction shown in Fig. 5 and the power divider in Fig. 6 are selected to experimentally
verify the accuracy of the proposed calibration equations, (26)–(27) and (34)–(37), respectively.
Both circuits are fabricated on the PCB RO4003C, the same PCB used to characterize the
reflections from a nonideal termination. Traditional two-port TRL measurements on these
three-port devices were carried out by a two-port VNA, Agilent E8362B, to remove the errors
associate with the testing setup. The unmeasured port is terminated with a regular nonideal
50-Ω load. One TRL measurement is enough for the Y-junction and two TRL measurements
are required for the power divider with Port 2 and Port 3 terminated in turns. The results are
compared to the three-port TRL measurement results by the same VNA, but combined with a
test set N4419B to offer a complete solution for three-port or four-port measurements. Since the
measured result of the Y circuit is not finalized yet, only the comparisons of the power divider
are shown in Fig. 7. The figures shows that the traditional two-port TRL calibration technique
can maintain accuracy in phase measurements throughout the spectrum of interest except when
the magnitude is too small as in 7(h), but it fails to provide accurate measurements in magnitude
at high frequencies because the reflections from the unmeasured port are too large to be ignored.
The proposed calibration technique is then applied to the data from the traditional two-port
TRL measurements. As can be seen from the same figures, the discrepancies are improved
significantly.

To evaluate the applicability of the proposed calibration technique for VNA-related measure-
ments, besides the accuracy it offers, the impact of the inherent errors occurred during measure-

Four-port devices such as 90 ◦ 3-dB hybrids implemented by branch lines or parallel coupled
lines are reciprocal and satisfies S11 = S22 = S33 = S44, S12 = S34, S13 = S24 and S14 = S23.

By solving (76), two tij values can be found. By substituing the solutions of tij to (69), S
′
ii and
S′jj can be found. Then, from (67) or (68), S
′
kk can be found. Substitue the above results to
(53) and (55), Sik and Sjk can be found. Note that due to the square in (53) and (55), there
are two sets of solution for Sik and Sjk. Therefore, there are totally 8 sets of solution including
the two choices of tij. By substituting Sik and Sjk to (54), finally Sij can be found.
5 Procedure for Determining the Right Solution
After solving the S-parameters, we can substitue them to the 9 measurement equations to see
which one satisfies the eqautions. We can write a program to evaluate the error produced by each
set of solutions and choose the one with the minimum error as the correct solution. Similation
by Ansoft ADS proves the correctness of our equations. However, experimental verification is
still needed to prove the usefulness of this techniquie and will be done in the future.
6 Conclusion
An economical solution to accurately measure the S-parameters of some common symmetrical
three- and four-port devices using two-port VNAs is presented. This approach follows the same
procedure employed by the traditional two-port TRL technique for measuring three- and four-
port devices, however, signal reflections from the unmeasured port with a nonideal termination
are taken into account. Calibration equations are developed to remove the errors introduced by
such reflections. The improvement on measurement accuracy is justified by comparing the data
before/after calibration to the data from three-port TRL measurements using four-port VNAs.
Furthermore, error analysis also indicates that the error introduced by VNAs is maintained
in the same order after apply the calibration equations. These features qualify the proposed
calibration technique a better solution for measuring three- and four-port devices using two-port
VNAs.
However, for general 3-port devices, even though we are able to derive the formulas success-
fully, more work needs to be done to establish it as a feasible solution for 3-port measurement.

respectively. The second equation indicates the random variable Θ is uniformly distributed over
the interval (α, β). From (82), (84), and (85), the following relationship is established,
fRΘ(r, θ) = fR(r)fΘ(θ),
and, therefore, the magnitude R and phase Θ of the random variable Z are mutually indepen-
dent.
In addition, from (84) the cumulative density function (cdf) of the random variable R can
be obtained as follows:
FR(r) = Prob (R ≤ r) =
∫ r
−∞
fR(r)dr =


0 if r ≤ a
r2 − a2
b2 − a2
if a < r < b
1 if r ≥ b
. (86)
Note that the function FR(·) in (86) is strictly increasing over the interval (a, b). Hence for
0 < q < 1, by the intermediate value theorem of calculus, there is a unique value of r such that
FR(r) = q. Thus the inverse function F
−1
R (q) with 0 < q < 1 is well defined and given by
F−1R (q) =
√
a2 + q (b2 − a2), 0 < q < 1. (87)
Similarly, the cdf of the random variable Θ can be derived from (85) as follows:
FΘ(θ) = Prob (Θ ≤ θ) =
∫ θ
−∞
fΘ(θ)dθ
=


0 if θ ≤ α
1
β − α
(
θ −
α+ β
2
)
+
1
2
if α < θ < β
1 if θ ≥ β
. (88)
The nature of monotonic increase of the function FΘ(·) over the interval (α, β) also well defines
its inverse function F−1
Θ
(q) with 0 < q < 1, which can be expressed as
F−1
Θ
(q) = (β − α)
(
q −
1
2
)
+
α+ β
2
, 0 < q < 1. (89)
A.1 Generating the Random Variable R in Eq.(80) via a Ran-
dom Variable U Uniformly Distributed over (0,1)
Let U be a random variable with a uniform distribution over the interval (0,1). That is, the pdf
of U is
fU (u) =
{
1 if 0 < u < 1
0 otherwise
. (90)
Then the random variable defined by
R = F−1R (U) =
√
a2 + U (b2 − a2) (91)
is distributed over the interval (a, b) and has FR(r) in (86) as its cdf. To show this, since
the function F−1R (·) is monotonically increasing over the interval (a, b), the pdf of the random
variable R in (91) is
g(r) = fU(FR(r))
∣∣∣∣dFR(r)dr
∣∣∣∣ =


2r
b2 − a2
if a < r < b
0 otherwise
. (92)
Comparing (92) with (84) leads to g(r) = fR(r), and, therefore, the random variable R defined
in (91) has fR(r) in (84) and FR(r) in (86) as its pdf and cdf, respectively.
