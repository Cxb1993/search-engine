Instantaneous gas water heater with heat pump

Abstract 
This paper investigates a configuration that combines an instantaneous gas water 
heater and a heat pump. The main feature of the new configuration is that the cold 
water is preheated first in the condenser tank where the waster energy recycled by the 
heat pump from the flue of gas combustion is transferred from the refrigerant to the 
water. The thermodynamic analysis of the configuration is presented in this paper and it 
is found that there are three factors that must be considered when the configuration is 
designed. As a result, the instantaneous gas water heater can thus be enhanced the 
energy factor from around 0.55 to above 0.80. The energy factor under different 
combination of design factors is discussed and some design concepts are also 
suggested. 
Keywords: gas water heater, heat pump. 
 
Introduction 
To create an energy-saving equipment or 
device has been most urgent today for the whole 
world because the fossil fuels consumption has 
risen gradually. In general, Energy Factor 
(hereafter, EF) is the best indicator of a DHW 
heater’s efficiency and is assessed by recovery 
efficiency, standby losses, and cycling losses. 
The higher the EF is, the more efficient the 
water heater is. On the other hand, the lower the 
cost is, the more economic the water heater is. A 
high-efficiency model can use 10 to 50% less 
energy than a conventional model and can 
reduce this by $20 to $100, making homes less 
expensive to operate. 
 
Generally speaking, gas-fired water storage 
heaters have an EF between 0.5 and 0.6, with 
some high-efficiency models around 0.8; oil 
heaters range from 0.7 to 0.85; heat pump water 
heaters range from 1.5 to 2.0. Electrical 
resistance water heaters have an EF between 0.7 
and 0.95, even though the electrical power plant 
has efficiency around 0.3 only. 
 
According to the above data, it is obvious 
that the value of EF will differ significantly due 
to various types of water heaters. Some previous 
studies have combined different features into 
newly-developed water heaters: integral- type 
solar-assisted heat pump (ISAHP) water heater 
designed by Huang and Chyng, 1998, and a 
storage heater incorporated with heat pump 
invented by Patnaik et. al., 2002. To distinguish 
from these two newly developed types of water 
heater, this paper will investigate a new 
design-DHW heater, namely, an instantaneous  
gas water heater with a heat pump, which will 
supply hot water with high EF.

Secondly, look at the gas burner. Parts of 
the combustion heat have been exchanged into 
water at the boiler, and the flues carry the 
residue heat, which has not been transferred to 
water. Hence, the energy conservation for gas is 
expressed as equation (4).

The efficiency of boiler is defined as

Thirdly, heat pump placed here is to 
connect the flues and the entering cold water. It 
delivers the recycled energy from evaporator and 
electric work of compressor to condenser. The 
evaporator recycles some residue heat 
downstream the gas burner. The refrigerant 
carries the heat to the condenser for preheating 
cold water. The exhausted gas combustion heat 
neither captured by the boiler nor by the 
evaporator is the real waste heat. Equations (6) 
and (7) express the energy balance equations for 
evaporator and for heat pump, respectively.

The recycled heat is retrieved from the 
residue heat. The ratio of the former to the latter 
is defined as the recycled efficiency of 
evaporator. Equation (7) expresses the

From the above investigation, the overall 
energy efficiency of instantaneous gas water 
heaters with heat pump (per MJ of hot water 
delivered) tends to be high because part of the 
flue energy is recycled. By the way the 
combination of the instantaneous gas water 
heater and the heat pump can be incorporated 
into an integrated system to form a newly 
designed DHW heater, which can supply hot 
water immediately and can provide higher EF 
than a traditional gas water heater. 
 
Obviously, the new model has feedback 
and time delay which cause some complexities 
during operation. The need for gas decreases 
because of the preheating water. Thus, the 
recycled heat, and the condensed heat will 
decrease and the heating contribution ratio, the 
temperature of evaporation and condensation 
both shift to new balance states. Besides, the 
COP of the heat pump could be unstable. 
Furthermore, both the variations of performance 
and the principle of control need to be verified 
through a series of field experiments. 
 
Conclusions 
This paper reports an investigation on the 
all-new model of instantaneous gas water heater 
with heat pump, which can supply the hot water 
with the shortest time when there is a need 
whereas heat pump water heaters will produce a 
higher value of EF compared with other types of 
water heaters. The expression of the EF is 
derived in terms of some design factors, COP, 
recycled energy fraction, and the heating 
contribution. The appreciated EF above 0.8 has 
competitive potential than the others models in 
market. 
An important conclusion should be made 
that the gas flow rate and the water flow rate 
should match each other to keep the system will 
not be out of running. There are still other 
energy issues such as startup energy, electrical 
controller energy, fan-forced vent, electrical 
sensors, electrical ignition, and frost protection. 
However, all of them should be considered in 
practical analysis.
