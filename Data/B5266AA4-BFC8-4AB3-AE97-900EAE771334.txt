三、文獻探討 
 
在 polling system 中典型的 service 
disciplines 計有 exhaustive，gated，
limited，k-limited 及 time-limited，等
多種，它們在[2]-[5]中皆有詳盡的探討，
這些現有的分析方法，大都根據 queuing 
theory 來推演其結果，所以他們都必須做
相當強的假設，例如 arrival process 是
Poisson，service time 是 exponential 
distribution 或甚至如 buffer size 是∞
等。所以他們的結果並不切合實際狀況，
而 我 們 擬 將 polling system with 
k-limited service discipline 形成一個
模擬最佳化問題。此類型問題在[6]-[11]
中有相當多的探討，但與他們不同的是，
我們將採用序的最佳化方法[12]-[14]來
解它。

model, then pick the best setting among the s . The OO 
theory had shown that for  in (i) and a surrogate 
model with moderate noise in (ii), the best setting selected 
from (iii) with s ≅35 must belong to the GS with 
probability 0.95, where GS represents a collection of the 
top 5% actually good enough settings among the 
1000=N
N . This 
means the best setting in SS selected from (iii) is among 
the actual top 5% of the N  settings with probability 0.95. 
However, the good enough solution of problem (1) that 
we are searching for should be a good enough setting in 
 instead of the Θ N  settings unless Θ  is as small as N  
[14]. As indicated in a recent paper by Lin and Ho [15], 
under a moderate modeling noise, the top 3.5% of the 
uniformly selected N  settings will be among the top 5% 
settings of a huge  with a very high probability ( 0.99), 
and the best case can be among the top 3.5% settings of 
 provided that there is no modeling error. However, for 
 with a size of , a top 3.5% setting is a setting 
among the top ones. The solution among the top 
 of the  solutions is not convincing to be a 
good enough solution with high probability in the sense of 
practical applications. Therefore to apply the existing goal 
softening searching procedures, we need to develop a new 
scheme to select 
Θ ≥
Θ
Θ 3010
28105.3 ×
28105.3 × 3010
N  roughly good settings from Θ  to 
replace (i) so as to ensure the final selected-setting is an 
actually good enough solution of (1) with high probability. 
 
Heuristic methods for obtaining N  roughly good settings 
may depend on how well one’s knowledge about the 
considered system. For instance in the optimal power flow 
problems with discrete control variables, Lin, et al. [16] 
proposed an algorithm based on the OO theory and 
engineering intuition to select N  roughly good discrete 
control vectors. However, the engineering intuition may 
work only for specific systems. Thus, in this paper, we 
will propose an OO theory based systematic approach to 
select N  roughly good settings fro  Θ  and combine 
with the existing goal softening searching procedures to 
find a good enough solution of (1). The presentation of 
this OO theory based algorithm to solve (1) for a good 
enough solution is a novel approach in the area of stochastic 
simulation optimization and is the contribution of this 
paper. Application of the proposed algorithm to a 
stochastic simulation optimization problem of a G/G/1/K 
polling system, which will be introduced and formulated 
in Section 4, is another contribution of this paper.

We organize our paper in the following manner. In 
Section 2, we will describe our approach for finding N  
roughly good settings from Θ . In Section 3, we will 
present the proposed OO theory based algorithm to solve 
for a good enough solution of the stochastic simulation 
optimization problem. In Section 4, we will present the 
G/G/1/K polling model and describe the corresponding 
stochastic simulation optimization problem for 
minimizing the weighting average waiting time. In 
Section 5, we will compare the results obtained by our 
approach with those obtained by the existing service 
disciplines. In addition, we will demonstrate the 
computational efficiency and the quality of the obtained 
good enough solution of our approach by comparing with 
the genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) 
method. Finally, we will make a conclusion in Section 6. 
 
 
2.  Fiding N  Roughly Good Settings from 
Decision-Variable Space 
 
As indicated in the OO theory [12]-[13], performance 
“order” of the settings is likely preserved even evaluated 
using a crude model. Thus, to select )1000(=N  roughly 
good settings from Θ  without consuming much 
computation time, we need to construct a surrogate model 
that is computationally easy to estimate the objective 
value of (1) for a given setting θ , and use an efficient 
scheme to select N  roughly good settings. Our surrogate 
model is constructed based on an ANN [17], and our 
selection scheme is GA [6]. 
 
2.1 The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Based 
Model 
 
Considering the inputs and outputs as the settings Θ∈θ  
and the corresponding objective values )]([ θJE , 
respectively, we can use an ANN to implement the 
mapping from the inputs to the outputs [17]. First of all, 
we will select a representative subset of Θ  by uniformly 
picking M , say 500, settings from Θ . Then we will 
evaluate )]([ θJE  of these M  settings using an 
approximate model, which can be a stochastic simulation 
with moderate number of random test samples, say 1000 
random test samples, as indicated in [14]. These collected 
M  input-output pairs of (θ , )]([ θJE ) will be used to 
train the ANN to adjust its arc weights. Once this ANN is 
trained, we can input any setting θ  to obtain an 
estimation of the corresponding )]([ θJE  from the output 
of the ANN; in this manner, we can avoid an accurate but 
lengthy stochastic simulation to evaluate )]([ θJE  for a 
given θ . This forms our surrogate model to estimate the 
objective value of (1) for a given setting θ  roughly but 
efficiently. ANN is considered to be a universal function 
approximator [17] including the relationship between the 
input and output of the discrete event simulated systems 
as presented in [18] and [19], however, the approximation 
accuracy is closely related to the complicacy of the 
structure of the ANN. In other words, there is a tradeoff 
between the accuracy and training time. Since what we 
care here are the relative performance order of θ ’s rather 
than the values of )(θJ ’s, we can employ a simple two-
layer feedforward ANN as our model. To speed up the 
convergence, we employ the scaled conjugate gradient 
algorithm [20] to train the ANN.

4.2 G/G/1/K Polling Model 
 
The polling model considered here is a G/G/1/K polling 
model, which accounts for general arrival processes, 
general distribution of service time and finite queue 
length for each queue. Assuming there are J  queues and 
each queue has length K , the G/G/1/K polling model is 
shown in Fig. 1. This polling model is more realistic, 
however it will cause vast difficulties for the existing 
service disciplines mentioned in Section 4.1 to analyze the 
system’s performance. Since it is hardly to get any 
analytical formula for evaluating the system’s 
performance using the existing service discipline, it would 
be more practical to design a service discipline that can 
obtain better system’s performance for the G/G/1/K 
polling system. 
 
The proposed service discipline is a number-limited 
service discipline, that is when the server attends the th 
queue, it will serve for  customers (jobs or 
packets) or until the queue becomes empty, whichever 
comes first. Thus,  is a decision vector of 
our number-limited service discipline. We assume that a 
customer that completing the service will depart from the 
system, and any customer being served but yet completed 
will not be interrupted by any reason. The switchover 
time of the cyclic server switching to next queue is 
assumed to be of normal distribution with mean

4.3 The Stochastic Simulation Optimization Problem 
 
We denote the random variable  as the waiting time of 
a typical customer of the th queue at steady state. The 
waiting time is defined as the time length from arrival 
instant until the beginning of service. Then,  
represents the average waiting time of a customer in the 
th queue at steady state. We let 
jW

coefficient of queue , then j ∑
=
J
j
jj WEJ 1
][1 τ  denotes the 
weighting average waiting time of the G/G/1/K polling 
system. 
 
Now, we can formulate our stochastic simulation 
optimization problem for the G/G/1/K polling system as

                     (2) 
subject to the G/G/1/K polling model. 
 
In other words, we are looking for an optimal number-
limited service discipline to minimize the weighting 
average waiting time of a G/G/1/K polling model. 
Suppose 20=K , then the size of the decision variable 
space of (2) will be JK  or  provided that 1020 10=J . 
Note that  is allowed to be more than jm K , because 
during the period when the server serves a customer, new 
customers may arrive; however, such an m  should 
not be a good choice unless the arrival rate is very high. 
Thus, problem (2) is a stochastic optimization problem 
with huge decision variable space as depicted in (1) and is 
especially suitable for the proposed ordinal optimization 
approach to solve for a good enough number-limited 
service discipline.

Remark: The four existing service disciplines stated in 
Section 1 can be viewed as special cases of the number-
limited service discipline. For examples,  for all Km j >>
Jj ,,1L=  corresponds to the exhaustive service 
discipline; sufficiently large  for all )( Km j ≤ Jj ,,1L=  
corresponds to the gated service discipline; 1=jm  for all 
Jj ,,1L=  corresponds to the limited service discipline; 
the time-limited service discipline is an inefficient scheme 
from the number-limited service discipline viewpoint, 
because the server has to stay at the queue before time out 
expires even if the queue is empty. 
 
 
5.  Test Results and Comparisons 
 
To test our approach, we set the parameters of the polling 
model as follows: 10=J ; the arrival process of the th 
queue is Poisson with arrival rate 
j
jλ  for Jj ,,1L=  as 
shown in Table 1; the service time is of exponential 
distribution with service rate 20=μ ; the mean and 
standard derivation of the switchover time of normal 
distribution are 301=δ sec and 01.0=σ , respectively;
