計畫中文摘要
在近 3~5 年間,矽化鎳材質成為最具潛力的閘極材料，特別是用於奈米極的半導體元
件上 (90nm 和 65nm)。其主要就是 NiSi 的低電阻特性，就是由於 NiSi 的特性，近年來
很多科技半導體公司發表了一 些研究成果，其中更說明了 NiSi 可用在閘極寬度極小的元
件上，使其仍保持低電阻與低漏電流的良好特性。雖然用 NiSi 材質做的元件在初期成果
令人興奮,但仍須時間去深入研究這個新材料的一些優點和它的使用極限，以便真正將這
技術發展成熟,取代目前的 CoSi2的技術。
針對 NiSi 材料來說,雖然和 CoSi2都是用在電晶體閘極和源/汲極處，但它的特性確大
有不同，這就是這個計畫最主要的目的，我希望這個研究能帶領目前業和學術界更上一層
樓，清楚的了解 NiSi，讓這門技術成熟量產。
當晶體的閘極寬度小於 50 nm 以下時，傳統的 CoSi2做為閘極金屬材質面臨困境，三大
困境: (一)電阻值的增加 (二)當用於 SOI 技術時， Co 和 Si 的反應必定要減少到極薄(三)
CoSi2不適用在 SiGe 為基底材質的技術
因此 NiSi 材料是最好的新材料能克服以上三點問題，它的優點可歸納如下 : (一)降
低溫度界點(thermal budget) (二)低電阻和減少 Si 原子的消耗(三)NiSi 的形成是由 Ni
原子的擴散來控制( 四)低電阻的 NiSi 也可在 SiGe 的材料形成
就如同要更換任何舊材質或改進它之前，新材質的優點是來自於製程上面臨瓶頸而須
突破，所以這計畫的二大重點如下 ；
(一) 研究 Ni-FUSI 的物理特性
 NiSi 對溫度的穩定性

6A Thermally Robust Ni-FUSI Process using in 65 nm CMOS Technology
Abstract
The interest in the low resistivity fully silicided gate increased significantly
because of promising in use as contact to the source, drain, and gate for sub-65nm/45nm
CMOS devices. NiSi is potentially an attractive material due to its capability to
maintain low resistivity even for channel length down to 100 nm. The Formation of
thermally stable silicide gates is important for improving the devices fabrication
processes. In order to obtain a thermally stable Ni-FUSI gate electrode, we introduced a
two-step annealing process associated with properly tuned thickness of the initial Ni
film and additional of implantation of BF2 during the poly-gate formation to push the
transformation of NiSi2 to higher temperatures at about 900 ℃ and retard agglomeration.
A mixed-phase of nickel silicide layer was commonly observed during phase
transformation. For the first time, we established an effective way to identify the
phase transformations by some nondestructive techniques such as X-ray diffraction,
sheet resistance measurement and AFM analysis. The correlations between its
electrical and morphological changes during Ni-Si phase transformation were presented.
Furthermore, the effect with addition amount of BF2 impurities into NiSi was
investigated. F-incorporation demonstrated some improvements in both morphology
and phase stability of the NiSi films at high processing temperatures.

8substrate, the increase of temperature on the process window for NiSi is needed. Our
work is to implement a unique silicide formation process in order to maintain a thermal
stable of NiSi at high processing temperatures. The key element to achieve this
challenge is to introduce a fine tuned two-step annealing process with a properly
thickness of the initial Ni film. Moreover, additional implantation of BF2 into poly-Si
crystalline was incorporated. Several measurement techniques such as XRD, TEM,
Resistivity and AFM were carried out to understand its physical and electrical properties.
The correlations between its electrical and morphological changes during Ni-Si phase
transformation were established.
2. Experiments
P-type (100) oriented silicon substrates were used to obtain Ni/Poly-Si/SiO2 stacks.
After clean the silicon substrate, a 5 nm gate oxide (SiO2) was thermally grown using a
Vertical Furnace system at temperature around 800 ℃. Undoped Poly-Si layers of
about 100 nm were deposited using a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD)
with temperature at around 620 ℃. Some samples were then implanted with BF2 with
dose of 3x1015 cm-2, 5x1015 cm-2 or 8x1015 cm-2and implant energy of 30 keV followed
by a spike activation anneal at 1100 ℃ in N2 ambient for 5 seconds. On the other hand,
some samples were left without implantation as references. The implant equipment
was Varian Ion Implant Systems-E220HP/E500HP Implanter. After Poly-Si deposition,
the Ni film was deposited by using a metal-physics vapor deposition (PVD) technique
with deposition rate at 1 nm/sec. The film thickness of Ni was ranging between
65nm~35nm. The fully silicidation (FUSI) was carried out by using a two-step
annealing process. The first anneal step was done at a low temperature of 400 ℃ for
120 s in an N2 ambient after deposited nickel film. The unreacted metal films were
etched away by NH4OH:H2O2:H2O solution. A second annealing step was at a higher
temperatures ranging from 500 ℃ to 900 ℃ for 60 s in an N2 ambient.
To study the kinetics of Ni-Si phase transformation, samples were characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuKαradiation for phase identification. Besides, the
electrical sheet resistance of nickel silicide film was measured by four-point probe to
correlate with XRD data. The topography of films was captured by Digital
Instruments AFM since AFM images are convenient to calculate the surface roughness
and characterize the grain size distribution of nickel silicide films. A JEOL-JEM
2010F transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operating at 200 kV was used for TEM
examination. The elemental analysis of the samples was identified by a TEM
equipped with an Oxford Link energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS).

temperature around 500 ℃. In Fig. 2(c), a single phase of NiSi2 (2Ө~28) was fuly 
dominated at nickel silicide layer. It implicated that NiSi phase transformed to a single
phase of NiSi2 completely at processing temperatures ~700 ℃, when samples with low
tNi/tSi ratios (less than 0.35). Since Ni silicides have limited composition range,
mixed-phase films are formed within Ni-Si system (Ni2Si, NiSi and NiSi2). NiSi2
grows by a nucleation-controlled process and does not form uniformly below 700 ℃
[18,19], so that incomplete silicidation was seen for the tNi/tSi ratio less than 0.5. In our
experiments, we found that the Ni-Si phase transforms as a function of thermal history,
initial nickel thickness and BF2 dosage. The key in leading a thermally robust NiSi is
to implement a two-step thermal anneal process incorporating with high tNi/tSi ratios.
3.2 Phase Characterization by Sheet Resistance Analysis
To understand the stages of the nickel reaction with silicon, a series of second
annealing temperatures (500 ℃, 700 ℃, and 900 ℃), tNi/tSi ratio (0.65, 0.5, and 0.35)
and implant dosage of BF2 (3x1015 cm-2, 5x1015 cm-2 and 8x1015 cm-2) were considered
into the experiments. The sheet resistance measurements were conducted on each
wafer at different experimental conditions. The average sheet resistance data was
based on the origin of 49 measurement sites on each wafer. The average sheet
resistance data after different thermal treatment temperatures is plotted in Fig.3a.
After the first annealing step (400 ℃), the average sheet resistance of all samples was
maintained below 10 ohms/sq. When the second annealing temperatures around at 500
℃, the average sheet resistances shift down to less than 3 ohms/sq. Moreover, by
increasing the second annealing temperature to around at 700 ℃, for samples with tNi/tSi
=0.35 (see circle in Fig. 3a), it has been observed a slightly rise on the average sheet
resistance level. This is due to mixed-phase of NiSi and NiSi2 containing in Ni-Si
matrix. It was been identified by XRD data (Fig. 3b). In Fig. 3b, a peak representing
NiSi2 content was observed at 2Ө=28.5 and co-exist with NiSi phase where peaks at
2Ө=44~48.  For Ni-Si system, it is known that the formation of Ni2Si occurs at around
250 ℃, and NiSi starts the agglomeration process at around 600 ℃ [18,19]. The
formation of these two silicides is controlled by diffusion mechanism. The formation
of NiSi2, on the other hand, is a nucleation-controlled process, which takes place at
temperatures around 700~750 ℃ for thin NiSi films in contact with Si. Once second
annealing temperatures at 900 , a sharp increase in the sheet resistance was found for℃
Ni thickness at 35 nm and 50 nm, while the sheet resistance increasing slightly for Ni
thickness at 65nm and a higher BF2 dose (8x1015 cm-2). The sharp increase in the
average sheet resistance is due to complete transformation of NiSi to a high resistivity
NiSi2 phase. This was confirmed by XRD data (Fig. 2c). Based on the sheet
12
agglomeration rather than the phase transition that influence the film physical property
more significantly during high temperature thermal process. Therefore, the key for
enhancing morphological of nickel silicide film is to maintain the stability of NiSi
phase.
3.4 Effect of BF2 Dopant
The effect of BF2 incorporation was been investigated. It has been reported that
the F incorporation can also improves the phase and morphological stability of NiSi
[16]. In our experiments, it is shown that the BF2 incorporated with the nickel
silicidation can affect the sheet resistance effectively only at a higher second anneal
temperatures (~900 ℃). Fig. 6 plots the average sheet resistance of nickel silicide
films with different Ni thickness after second annealing process at different
temperatures (500 ℃, 700 ℃, and 900 ℃) for 60 s. In Fig. 6a and 6b, for second
annealing temperature at 500 ℃ and 700 ℃, the BF2 dose shows no significant impact
on the sheet resistance between three different Ni thicknesses. It is the phase transition
that influences the film property more significantly. Obviously, it indicates that the
thicker films present better thermal stability than thinner ones in terms of both
agglomeration and transformation. Once the second annealing temperatures reach at
~900 ℃, the average sheet resistance of nickel silicide film without BF2 dose was
higher than that of nickel silicide film with BF2 atoms incorporation (see Fig. 6c). It
implies that F atoms can possibly improve the morphological stability of nickel silicide
films and pushing the NiSi2 phase transformation to higher processing temperatures.
Again, we intent to correlate the various phase of Ni-Si systems with its physical
and electrical properties. The XTEM and EDX analysis were employed to further
investigate the BF2 dopant effects during nickel silicide reaction. In our study, two
XTEM samples which were doped with BF2 and with two distinct sheet resistance
values (Rs=1.453 ohms/sq and Rs=140 ohms/sq) are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. In
Fig. 7, the morphology observed corresponds to a NiSi film. XRD and EDX
quantitative analysis confirmed that the film is the NiSi phase, and almost the only
phase observed in the layer. It shows very rough oxide/NiSi interface and all the
Poly-Si has been consumed in NiSi. The EDX analysis identified a largely amount of
F atoms which segregating between at silicide grain boundaries through formation of
strong Si-F and Ni-F bonds. It effectively suppressed the drive force for grain growth
and agglomeration. Since Ni does not totally react during the first annealing step, it is
assumed that the silicidation kinetics slows down because BF2 piles up at the Ni2Si front,
resulting in the sheet resistance value is only at around 1.453 ohms/sq. The enhanced
morphological and phase stability of Ni with BF2 implanted poly-Si is believed due to
the presence of F. F segregation to NiSi grain boundaries inhibits silicide grain growth.
