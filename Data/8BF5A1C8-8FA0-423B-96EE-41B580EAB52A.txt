molecule might be able to self-organize into different conformations for designated 
purposes or required assembly patterns,[14-15] which might be recognized as well as 
a kind of divided behaviors related to several parts of molecules. However, the 
possible occurrence of microphase separation for the systems of synthetic 
homopolymers, and the consequent influence on the formation of ordered packing is 
less systematically explored, which is subjected to be discussed in this reported work. 
 
A series of newly designed polyimides, composed of aromatic polyimide backbones 
and methylene side chains with terminal 4-cyanobiphenyl groups, were synthesized 
based on the polycondensation of 3,3’,4,4’-biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride 
(BPDA) with 2,2＇-bis{u-[4- (4-cyanophenyl) phenyoxy-n-alkoxy carbonyl]}-4,40 
-biphenyl diamine, named BPDA-nCBBP, of which the chemical structure is shown in 
Figure 1, where n is the number of methylene units in the side chains.  
 
 
Figure 1. The schematic molecular structure of BPDA-nCBBP 
 
 
As the liquid crystalline side chains are covalently bonded with rigid aromatic 
polyimide backbone through a flexible aliphatic spacer, this series of polymers with 
designed molecular structure is considered as an ideal candidate for studying possible 
microphase separation between side chains and rigid backbones. Unusual crystalline 
phases on this series of BPDA–nCBBP, which possesses n = 7, 9, and 11 methylene 
units in the side chains, are reported.[16] These crystalline phases were recognized to 
establish based on regular packing of remarkable large unit cells with low symmetry, 
they are either triclinic or monoclinic phases. As a result, supermolecules, or namely 
the organization of several molecules due to preferred intermolecular interaction, have 
been considered as a kind of crystallographic unit arranged according to the symmetry 
of the resulted three dimensional packing. And the side-chain length is found to be a 
critical parameter for the evolution of ordered structures. Similar supramolecular 
structure of liquid crystalline polyesters constructed by unusual large unit cells were 
also found and studied by Iannelli at 2002, [17-18] a layer-type of supermolecules that 
accommodates about ten to twelve repeat units of studied polymer was proposed with 
the support from the comparison between the simulated and experimentally-observed 
fiber diffraction patterns. This layer-type organization is also conceived to result from 
packing incompatibility of rigid polyester backbones and flexible aliphatic side 
groups.

structures in diblock copolymers. [19] Therefore in this system, the melting events as 
well as growth of supramolecular phase or high-order liquid crystalline structure are 
speculated to be responsible for this set of DSC results. 
 
Considering the rigid backbone and consequent mobility of this studied aromatic 
polyimide, BPDA-11CBBP, the melting process of crystalline phase, if there is any 
that can be possibly grown during these controlled cooling processes, should be 
severely influenced by applied heating rates. Following this argument, it appears more 
or less unlikely that this lower-temperature exothermic transition is related to the 
growth of crystalline phase. In summary, this result reflects the polymorphous nature 
of this series of synthesized aromatic polyimides, and a multiple-step ordering process 
might already take place before the occurrence of possible crystal growth in the bulk 
sample.  
 
The spatial molecular arrangement, which can be explored by wide angle X-ray 
diffraction (WAXD), frequently provides another means to study the nature and cause 
of possible assembly behaviors. Illustrated in the Figure 3, two diffraction peaks can 
be easily identified at low-angle region in this one-dimension (1D) WAXD spectrum 
obtained from studied aromatic polyimides, BPDA-11CBBP, and one relatively sharp 
amorphous halo is found at larger scattering angle. Moreover, a smaller diffuse halo 
can be recognized, but barely, around the scattering angle 2 　of 13. With the 
simplicity of this WAXD spectrum, apparently the development of ordered structure 
in this studied sample is difficult to be correlated to crystalline phase, which also 
agrees with revealed phase behavior based on DSC experiments. Moreover, before 
examined by X-ray diffraction, this BPDA-11CBBP sample was melted at 270°C and 
subsequently quenched by liquid nitrogen. As a result, the growth of concerned 
ordered phase, must be able to completely finish through the whole sample during the 
quenching from 270°C. In order to identify the ordered phase(s) that can possibly 
develop in the bulk sample, an annealing treatment at 180°C for 12 hours was 
employed. Nevertheless, as illustrated in the Figure 3 as well, exactly the same 
WAXD diffraction spectrum was obtained from annealed sample. This result 
evidently indicates that no further phase transition can take place during subsequent 
annealing process applied on this quenched sample. Therefore, considering the phase 
behavior revealed by WAXD spectrums and DSC thermographs, the growth of 
corresponding ordered phase responsible for yielding this 1D WAXD spectrum can be 
reasonably related to the exothermic transition occurring at about 220°C mentioned 
above in the discussion of DSC experimental results. Following this discussion, from 
both the structural and phase behavior perspectives, only high order liquid crystalline

direction, which is a relatively uncommon situation discussed in the literature. 
 
Could this pair of spherical diffractions on the equator represent the existence of a 
different ordered structure that has not been found yet in the bulk sample? This fiber 
sample was drawn from the raw material at the temperature just above Tg, and no 
further thermal treatment is applied. Indicated previously, the annealing process at 
180°C is not going to trigger the occurrence of any phase transition in the bulk sample. 
Therefore, it is less likely to cause the growth of other ordered phase, or induce the 
occurrence of phase transition, simply with the fiber drawing process at 140°C 
slightly above Tg of about 85°C. Nevertheless, without the appearance of second 
order diffraction on the equator, this observed pair of spherical equatorial diffractions 
with unusually broad range of diffraction angles will unavoidably meet certain 
difficulties and uncertainties to be accounted for the existence of a conventional layer 
stacking. 
 
Considering the novel molecular structure of this studied aromatic polyimide that 
contains amid ring on the backbones and cyanobiphenyl group on the side chains, 
both of them coming with different geometries and chemical natures, studying the 
preferred relative orientations of various parts of molecules under applied shear stress 
should help to further elucidate possible ways of coherent packing. The polarized IR 
experiments were employed to explore the orientations of functional groups of studied 
molecules in a sheared film. The experimental design purposely let the IR pass 
through the polarizer with adjustable rotation angle before propagate through the 
sheared thin film. As shown in Figure 5, the absorption of infrared light by the 
stretching vibration of the CN group at a wavelength of 2223 cm-1 is seen to increase 
as the angle of polarizer was changed from perpendicular (90º) to parallel to the 
shearing direction (0º). The absorption dichroic ratio (A// /A ) of this CN stretching is 
estimated to be 4.0. Therefore, it is known that the direction of dipole moment change 
due to the stretching vibration of CN group is parallel to the shear direction, which 
also indicates a parallel orientation of 4-cyanobiphenyl groups on the side chain. 
 
According to the reference 20 and 21, the absorption peak at 1772 cm-1 is related to 
the mode of symmetric stretching Vs(C=O) on the imide ring connected on the 
backbones. Moreover, the absorption peak at 1706 cm-1 is caused by asymmetric 
stretching Vas(C=O) on the imide rings. The maximum absorption by symmetry 
stretching Vs(C=O) on the imide rings occurs as the angle of polarizer is parallel to 
the shearing direction. And the maximum absorption by the asymmetric stretching 
Vas(C=O) on the imide rings is observed when the rotation angle of polarizer is 
 6
spherical equatorial diffraction appears universally for both BPDA-9CBBP and 
BPDA-7CBBP samples. For each sample, the estimated diffraction angle of spherical 
equatorial diffraction is the same with the first diffraction peak at low angle region of 
corresponding 1D WAXD spectrums. Therefore, it is manifested that similar layer 
type stacking should preferably develop universally in this series of synthesized 
aromatic polyimide since similar simple WAXD spectrums and fiber WAXD patterns 
have been observed. Nevertheless for these samples, as illustrated in the Figure 7, 
these corresponding first diffraction peaks at low angle region are apparently different 
in both intensity profile and diffraction angle. 
 
With the results shown in the Figure 7, it is obviously that there is an increase in the 
diffraction angles of these first diffraction peaks at low angle region as decreasing the 
number of methylene units included in the connection spacers. And comparing the 
periodic separations represented by these first diffraction peaks of three studied 
samples, the result is listed below. 
 
BPDA-11CBBP: BPDA-9CBBP: BPDA-7CBBP 
= 2.3 nm : 2.0 nm : 1.8 nm 
 
Since this concerned first diffraction peak is related to the periodic separation between 
layers, this result clearly points out that the periodic layer spacing will decrease as 
there is a shorter connection spacer between backbones and cyanobiphenyl groups. 
Moreover, this first diffraction peak at low angle region is very sharp for the 
BPDA-11CBBP sample, but the intensity profile of this diffraction gradually 
decreases for both the samples of BPDA-9CBBP and BPDA-7CBBP. Consequently 
the concerned periodic layer stacking is obviously under the influence of spacer 
length, which appears to be less perfect as there is a shorter spacer connecting the 
backbones and cyanobiphenyl groups. It is manifested that this proposed layer-type 
stacking might be able to help point out a direction for understanding possible ordered 
packing developed in the sample, but is not a comprehensive solution yet, further 
modification based on the influence of connection spacer is certainly needed. 
 
As reviewing all the results obtained from X-ray experiments carried on for these 
studied aromatic polyimides so far, obviously only simple diffraction patterns or 
simple diffraction spectrums have been observed. Therefore a relative simple structure 
should be the right answer to be accounted on. However, these experimental results all 
include some interesting, or said puzzling, details, which do not allow to be 
comprehensively understood by an ordinary answer, or namely, a conventional layer 
 8
by side stacking of molecular chains in a parallel fashion is believed to be the 
quadruple interaction between cyanobiphenyl groups, since the is the strongest 
secondary interaction that can be possibly found in this series of sample. From this 
point of view, as the cyanobiphenyl groups are also covalently boned to the 
neighboring backbone layers, this off-line movement of cyanobiphenyl actually leads 
to the formation of waved type of layer as shown in the Figure 9(a). This fact might 
implicate that each waved layer can be considered as a layer-type supermolecule, 
behaving as a stacking unit as well in this stacking model. Illustrated in the Figure 
9(b), a novel concept regarding to a type of “out-of-phase” stacking of waved layers 
has emerged with this stacking model. The amplitude of these waved layers is the 
separation between cyanobiphenyl groups along layer normal direction, and the 
horizontal separation between two neighboring backbones can be considered as the 
half wavelength. This formation of layer-type supermolecules can provide a rational 
linkage to understand the previously discovered and reported unusual triclinic phases 
that require repeat packing schemes of large unit cells composed of a number of 
repeat units of studied molecular chains, and help to provide a possible growth 
mechanism. [16][22-24] Therefore, recognizing this formation of layer-type 
supermolecules is able to critically justify the ordering evolution process from liquid 
crystalline phases to crystalline phases found in this series of synthetic aromatic 
polyimides. 
 
As mentioned previously, this off-line movement of cyanobiphenyl groups, or the 
waviness of each stacking layer, is originated to help to create a regular match 
between neighboring layers for favorable interactions among cyanobiphenyl groups 
and among rigid backbones as well. This regular match between neighboring layers 
can be referred to as a type of synchronized stacking of these waved layers, which is 
similar to an “out-of-phase” type of stacking. However, this off-line movement of 
cyanobiphenyl groups resulting from microphase separation basically could be 
initiated in three dimensions around the backbone. The preferred synchronized 
stacking of waved layers, as illustrated in the Figure 8(c) might not be able to prevail 
through the whole sample due to kinetic barrier. As illustrated in the Figure 8(d), both 
synchronized and non-synchronized stacking of these waved layers can occur in the 
sample. This lack of stacking regularity will lead to a broad distribution of layer 
spacing, which can be perfectly linked to the unusual extensive distribution of 
diffraction angles of observed spherical equatorial diffraction in the fiber WAXD 
pattern obtained universally from three studied aromatic polyimides. 
 
The influence of spacer length on this stacking model can be further evaluated in 
 10
might be disturbed by the applied shear stress along chain direction. As a result, a less 
regular layer stacking prevails instead with remaining a parallel layer stacking. 
Therefore, this shear stress along the chain direction behave as a negative factor for 
establishing additional spatial match for preferred interaction along layer normal 
direction, and impede regular and synchronized layer stacking. In this case, a more 
regular stacking is supposed to appear in the bulk samples.  
 
In order to further decipher the novel ordered arrangement of this studied aromatic 
polyimide and evaluate this stacking model of waved layers, sheared thin films of 
BPDA-11 were employed and analyzed by WAXD. Shown in the Figure 10, in this set 
of experiments, the sheared thin films were purposely aligned carefully in three 
mutual perpendicular orientations on the sample holder. Therefore the incident X-ray 
can shoot at different faces of the sheared thin film, and propagate along three mutual 
perpendicular axes. In this sheared thin film, both the backbones and cyanobiphenyl 
groups are parallel to shear direction based on previous polarized IR absorption 
experiments, which is designated as the c-axis. The resultant diffraction patterns were 
recorded on an image plane, which was expected to reveal the possible difference of 
periodic packing among three mutual perpendicular faces of sheared thin films. 
 
Illustrated in the Figure 11(a), as the incident x-ray propagates along the a-axis of thin 
film, the pair of strong spherical diffraction on the equator can be found as well and 
arc diffraction is located on the meridian. Undoubtedly, this diffraction pattern is very 
similar to what have been observed from fiber samples, and the scattering angle of the 
equatorial spherical diffraction is also about 2 　 = 3.8. However, as the incident 
X-ray propagated along the b-axis of thin film, illustrated in the Figure 11(b), only the 
arc diffraction on the meridian is still visible, the spherical diffraction can be barely 
recognized on the equator, but which is the strongest diffraction on the fiber WAXD 
pattern demonstrated previously. The disappearance of strong spherical diffraction on 
the equator evidently suggest that the periodic packing represented by this spherical 
diffraction is not arranged with cylindrical symmetry around the shear direction 
within this studied thin films. This anisotropic arrangement within sheared thin film 
agrees with the logical development of parallel stacking of layer-type stacking units 
with their layer normal direction preferably aligned perpendicular to shear direction. 
 
As the incident X-ray propagates along the c axis of studied thin film, as illustrated in 
the Figure 11(c), a clear and simple diffraction pattern is obtained, which shows that 
only a pair of huge arc diffractions appearing on the equator. After carefully 
calculation, this arc diffraction also possesses the same scattering angle with that of 
 12
 
Moreover, only regular synchronized regular stacking of waved layers can possibly 
fulfill the Braggs’ Law and cause the diffraction recorded on the image plane. Since 
the orientation distribution of layer normal direction becomes significant as the X-ray 
propagating along the c-axis direction of thin films, the non-synchronized layer 
stacking will not able to possess enough periodicity along the layer normal direction 
and effectively cause the diffraction. Therefore, for the pair of long arc equatorial 
diffractions with narrow intensity profile along the radial directions, the unusual 
length of this arc equatorial diffraction can be well understood as an indication of 
orientation distribution of these stacked waved layers, and the narrow radial intensity 
profile frankly reflects the fact that only the regular synchronized stacking of waved 
layers can have contribution to this arc diffraction.  
 
The broad diffuse halo at wider angle region that can be easily observed as x-ray 
propagating along the a-axis direction of sheared thin films, which is illustrated in the 
Figure 10(a), can not be observed as the incident x-ray propagating along the c-axis 
direction. As this broad diffuse halo is assumed to be referred to the resulted close 
stacking of biphenyl groups in between layers, or the stacking of rigid backbone, one 
of the possible explanations is that these stacking planes actually tilt around the a-axis, 
therefore, these stacking planes in different stacking domains do not appear parallel to 
each other. As the incident x-ray was purposely arranged to propagate along different 
directions, this set of X-ray experiments carried on for sheared thin film indicates that  
this proposed stacking model of waved layers is able to bring up satisfactory 
understanding for both observed spherical and arc equatorial diffractions. 
 
Due to the anisotropic arrangement of these waved-layer type supermolecules, this 
supramolecular phase in the thin film can be recognized as a biaxial supramolecular 
nematic phase, since the orientation order can naturally develop along two mutual 
perpendicular axes of thin film sample. And the three dimensional packing of 
proposed layer-type supermolecules can also satisfactorily explain the formation of 
previously discovered unusual triclinic phases, which necessarily involve the 
repeating scheme of huge unit cells that accommodates a number of molecular chains 
with low symmetry. Further investigations and detail evaluations of this biaxial 
orientation order in the thin film can be further carried on with available experimental 
means; however this study has provided a logical structural analysis for supporting the 
existence of this unusual biaxial feature.

expected to be helpful for developing polymer thin film useful for optical and

diffraction has much stronger intensity. Also diffuse halos at 
high-angle region are found on the equator.
Figure 11(c)This result is obtained as incident X-ray shooting at ab face of film and being 
parallel to shear direction. The sharp equatorial diffraction arcs with d-spacing about 
2.21nm on equator represent an average separation between molecular assemblies. No 
diffraction can be observed on the meridian, which probably means, by shearing process, 
no ordering builds up along the a direction in the film.
