Part 1. Structure characterization of conjugated polymers 
Introduction 
Polymer thin film transistors for low-cost, large-area, and flexible electronic 
applications have received increasing attention in the past decades.1-5 Regioregular 
polythiophenes and related copolymers have been potential candidates for such 
applications.6-8 Among them, poly(3,3′′′- didodecylquarterthiophene) (PQT-12, cf. 
inset of Figure 4b for chemical structure) has been recently demonstrated of its good 
stability in air and high charge carrier mobility upon self- organization into an ordered 
structure after heat treatment.9-12 Room-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 
transmission electron microscopic observations of Ong et al.9,10 indicated the presence 
of an ordered phase in PQT films annealed at 135 °C, to which a high hole mobility of 
0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (determined from devices fabricated under atmospheric oxygen) was 
attributed.12 There were clear hints for the presence of polymorphs, as the reported 
d-spacing value of the main X-ray reflection peak exhibited a dramatic change from 
1.2 to 1.6 nm under different processing conditions.9,10 A pair of differential scanning 
calorimetric (DSC) heating/cooling traces suggested a crystal-to-liquid crystal 
transition at TX-LC ≈ 110 °C and a liquid crystal-to-isotropic melt transition at TLC-I ≈ 
140 °C.11 Further details of the polymorphic behavior was not explored in subsequent 
studies, as attentions were paid to device fabrication and performance.12,13 Here we 
report our recent efforts in clarifying this polymorphic behavior of PQT-12 by means 
of high-temperature XRD. Results indicated that there are as many as 4 ordered 
polymorphs. Aside from a minor solvent-induced δ phase, the as-cast film comprises 
mainly the α phase (ca. 1.2 nm in layer spacing) with a broad melting range up to Tm,α 
= 120 °C. Upon cooling from the isotropic melt, there first appears the γ phase (ca. 1.7 
nm in layer spacing, Tm,γ ≈ 130 °C) which subsequently transforms into the β phase of 
only slightly smaller layer spacing (ca. 1.6 nm). When returned to room temperature, 
there always emerges from the amorphous matrix a minor amount of poorly 
developed α crystals. Interestingly, inter-chain π-π stacking exists mainly in β and γ 
phases and becomes increasingly extensive upon heat treatments.  
 
Experimental Section 
The PQT-12 sample used here was purchased from American Dye Source, Quebec, 
Canada. The weight-average molecular mass (Mw) was 22 kDa (with polydispersity 
index PDI = 2.2) as determined from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using 
polystyrene standards. The true Mw value would be ca. 8 kDa using a conversion 
factor of (2.9)−1 ≈ 0.34 from comparison between SEC and matrix-assisted laser 
desorption ionization-mass spectrometric results.11 Films were drop-cast from 0.4% 
toluene solutions on Al plate. For the in-house X-ray diffraction (XRD) study, a 
Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a copper target (Kα-line, with 
wavelength λ = 0.154 nm), a graphite collimator, and a vacuumed high-temperature 
stage (Anton Paar TTK-450) was used at a step-scan rate of 0.02° per 5 sec in the 
splitting (Figure 3b), suggesting completed γ-to-β transformation. The transformation 
between β and γ phases appears to be reversible, as XRD profiles during the 
subsequent heating/cooling cycles (cf. second curve from bottom of Figure 2c and the 
magnified view as top curve in Figure 3a as a demonstrative example) reproducibly 
generates the split-peak characteristics. In the vicinity of 110 °C, the β phase 
transforms to γ phase, which in turn dissipates as the temperature exceeds 120 °C.  
Residual α Phase. Upon further cooling to below 60 °C, a weak but clearly 
discernible reflection emerges around 2θ ≈ 7.5°, which coincides with the 
characteristic reflection of the phase. As there are no discernible changes in the 　
intensity of reflections from the β phase, this minor amount of α phase must have 
emerged from the amorphous matrix. These α crystals must have been essentially 
limited in thickness, resulting in premature melting below 110 °C upon reheating, as 
shown in Figure 2c. We emphasize here that these α crystals, although minor in 
amount, are always present after cooling from heat treatments at elevated 
temperatures. The corresponding contribution at 2θ ≈ 7.5° to the XRD profile should 
not be related to structural features of the dominant β phase.9,10  
Stacking of thiophene rings. Basic features in the second and the third heating 
sequences are similar; but we present XRD profile of the third heating sequence in 
Figure 2c for a particular reason. In most of the XRD profiles, there exists a reflection 
of 0.37 nm in d-spacing, which has been assigned to inter-chain π-π stacking by Ong 
et al.9-11 Selected-area electron diffraction pattern of heat-treated specimen indicated 
that the stacked thiophene rings lie vertical to film surface and hence attributable to 
the improved carrier mobility.9,10 On first look, our XRD observations appear to 
suggest that the π-π stacking appears phase-selective: it barely exists in α and δ 
phases (cf. Figures 1 and 2a) but more distinctively observable in β and γ phases (cf. 
Figures 2b,c and 3b). A deeper thought leads to the conclusion that thermal history at 
high temperatures should be the main factor: the π-π reflection becomes progressive 
intensified with thermal cycling (cf. Figures 2b,c and 3c). It exists in the isotropic 
melt (Figure 2a) and once extensively developed, may even persists up to 240 °C 
(Figure 2c) with domain size of 42 nm (calculated from Scherrer equation), meaning 
1-D correlation in excess of 110 thiophene rings stacked transversely to the backbone 
with no discernible correlation in the other two directions. The 1-D stacks of 
thiophene rings must orient randomly in the melt state, which is optically isotropic. 
This intriguing behavior is quite distinct from the well-studied case of regioregular 
poly(3-alkylthiophene)s and awaits further explorations. 
Calorimetric analysis. With XRD profiles explained, we are in a better position 
to interpret DSC traces which would otherwise be hard to comprehend. In the first 
DSC heating scan (bottom curve in Figure 3a) of the as-received sample, there exist a 
broad endothermic event up to 120 °C. On the basis of XRD observations shown in 
Figures 1 and 2a, we attribute this thermal event to the melting α phase. Upon 
subsequent cooling (bottom curve in Figure 3b), a tiny exotherm emerges at 90 °C, 
which corresponds to the formation of the γ phase. The major exothermic event 
occurring between 80 and 65 °C corresponds to formation of mainly β and  some α 
phases. In the second heating trace, there are three endothermic peaks. The first 
endothermic peak near 97 °C is attributed to the melting of poorly developed α 
crystals, the second (around 112 °C) and third (around 126 °C) endotherms are then 
attributed to the melting of β and γ phases, respectively. The third-cycle 
heating/cooling traces are similar to the corresponding second-cycle traces, indicating

Located at an azimuthal angle of 65°, the reflection of 0.42 nm in d-spacing is 
attributed to the 2-D hexagonal close-packing of dodecyl side-chains which from an 
angle of 35° from the backbone axis. Due to this side-chain tilting, the prominent 
layer spacing is decreased to 1.17 nm from that of 1.60 nm in the β phase (of 
transversely stretched dodecyl side-chains in the backbone plane). Concomitant 
torsions of backbone rings hence result in decreased conjugation length in the α phase

Part 3. Performance of polymer field effect transistors 
Introduction 
Organic nanostructures, such as nanowires and nanorods, with self-assembled 
molecular stacking have attracted significant attention in the past few years.1 Highly 
organized molecules induce a strong overlap between electronic wave functions of 
neighboring molecules, leading to high carrier mobilities.2 Nanostructures of 
conjugated small molecules or polymers have been demonstrated to be promising for 
both organic solar cells3,4 and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).5,6,7 The 
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) nanorods oriented perpendicularly to the substrate, 
which can be fabricated by using block copolymer8 and anodized aluminum oxide9,10 
as templates, have been used as donor material in organic solar cells.9 The 
performances of the organic solar cells that incorporate polymer nanorods were 
enhanced because the chain alignment and the carrier mobility in the nanorods were 
improved.9,10,11 Another device that incorporates the polymer nanorods is the polymer 
vertical transistor, named as the polymer space-charge-limited transistor 
(SCLT),12,13,14,15 which has a vertical channel length (L) of a few hundred nanometers. 
The chain alignment and the carrier mobility of the P3HT have been demonstrated to 
be enhanced by the cylindrical nanopores with a slow solvent annealing process.14 In 
the active area of the conventional SCLT, the holes are injected into the 
semiconducting polymer nanorods by the emitter at the bottom of the SCLT, passing 
through the openings on the base, and being collected by the collector. The voltages 
applied at the base and the collector control the magnitude of the potential barrier 
inside the carrier channel and hence the on and off states of the SCLT. In our previous 
report, an Al top electrode was used as the collector, and the indium tin oxide (ITO) 
bottom electrode was used as the emitter.12,13,14,15 The oxygen plasma treatment was 
required to enhance the work function of the ITO emitter for a better carrier injection 
property.12 However, the wok function of the oxygen plasma-treated ITO was 
switching swings of the SCLTs from the transfer characteristics when the collector to 
emitter voltage (VCE) was fixed. JC and VBE are the output current density and the 
base-to-emitter voltage of the SCLT. We use the term switching swing for SCLTs, 
because the operation principles of the SCLTs and the OFETs are different. 
 
 
Figure 1. (a) Schematic device structure of SCLT. The opening diameter is denoted 
by D, and the channel length is denoted by L. (b) The scanning electron microscope 
image of the vertically oriented PVP cylindrical nanopores with base on top. (c) The 
scanning electron microscope image of the device after coating semiconducting 
polymer. Partial semiconducting polymer is tore off to unveil polymer nanorods. The 
polymer nanorods can be seen in the vertically oriented PVP cylindrical nanopores 
with some distortion, which was caused when tearing off polymer. 
The diodes of P3HT and PQT-12 with different electrodes were prepared as a 
first step to understand the influence of the work function of the electrodes on hole 
injection properties. The current density (J)–electric field (E) curves of these diodes 
are shown in Fig. 2a. The work functions of electrodes as well as the HOMO and the 
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the P3HT and the PQT-12 are 
shown in Fig. 2b. The molecular structures of the P3HT and the PQT-12 are shown in 
Fig. 2c. When the ITO bottom electrode is positively biased, the holes are able to be 
injected to the P3HT from the oxygen plasma-treated ITO since the work function of 
oxygen plasma-treated ITO is about 5ԜeV which makes the hole injection barrier 
between oxygen plasma-treated ITO and P3HT negligible.12 However, since there is a 
hole injection barrier between the oxygen plasma-treated ITO and the PQT-12, it is 
much more difficult for the holes to be injected into the PQT-12, and hence, the 
current density is low. On the other hand, when negative bias is applied to the ITO 
105ԜmV/decade and the on/off current ratio of 4Ԝ×Ԝ104 are obtained. Such a low 
operation voltage and a low switching swing are superior to those of OFETs. This is 
the first time, without compromising transistor performances, that an air-stable 
semiconducting polymer with a high HOMO energy level is used as the active 
material for SCLT. Other high-performance semiconducting polymers with similar or 
lower HOMO energy levels could also be used as the active material for this SCLT 
structure.

350Ԝnm, respectively. 
A resistive-load inverter based on PQT-12 SCLT was then realized by 
connecting a top injection PQT-12 SCLT with a load resistor (RL) in series to
