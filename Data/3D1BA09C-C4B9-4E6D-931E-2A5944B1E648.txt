Abstract 
A TMD system consists of an added mass with 
properly functioning spring and damping elements 
that provide frequency-dependent damping in a 
primary structure. The design and application of 
linear typed tuned mass damper systems are well 
developed, nonlinear TMD systems are still 
developing. A friction-type TMD, i.e. a nonlinear 
TMD, has the advantages of energy dissipation via a 
friction mechanism. However, a passive-friction 
TMD (PF-TMD) has such disadvantages as a fixed 
and pre-determined slip load and the PF-TMD may 
lose its tuning and energy dissipation abilities when 
the PF-TMD is in its stick state. A 
semi-active-friction TMD (SAF-TMD) is used to 
overcome these disadvantages. The SAF-TMD is 
composed of a mass and a semi-active friction 
device. The friction force of the semi-active friction 
device is controllable. A non-sticking friction (NSF) 
control law, which is able to keep SAF-TMD 
activated throughout an earthquake with arbitrary 
intensity, was conducted. In this thesis, both 
theoretical and experimental investigations were 
conduced for the SAF-TMD system. The test results 
also demonstrate that the dynamic responses are 
very consistent with the theoretical ones obtained 
from numerical simulation. This verifies the 
feasibility and efficiency of the SAF-TMD system. 
Keywords: Tuned mass damper (TMD), shaking 
table test., friction, semi-active control. 
I. Introduction 
Tuned mass damper (TMD) systems, which 
were first proposed by Frahm 1911, and is a widely 
utilized strategy in the area of structural control, 
including high-rise buildings, observatory towers, 
building floors, railway bridges and pedestrian 
3 
amplify structural acceleration by causing 
discontinuous control forces that exert a 
high-frequency structural response.  Inaudi et al. 
1997 proposed a modulated homogenous friction 
control strategy for producing a slip force 
proportional to the prior local peak of the damper 
deformation. Similarly, this algorithm may also 
cause discontinuous control forces. In a subsequent 
study, Yang and Agrawal 2002 modified the Inaudi’s 
method for controlling isolated structures subject to 
near-fault ground motion. Lin et al. 2010b applied a 
non-sticking friction (NSF) controller that is able to 
keep the SAF-TMD in its slip state constantly for an 
earthquake with any intensity. 
For feasibility tests of the proposed SAF-TMD, 
a prototype SAF-TMD was fabricated and tested 
dynamically via a shaking table test. Firstly, the 
configuration and the constituent elements of the 
SAF-TMD are explained, and the mathematic model 
and the numerical analysis method for structure with 
an SAF-TMD are discussed. The test setup for the 
shaking table test of the prototype SAF-TMD, and 
the test results are explained. The experimental 
performance of the SAF-TMD is also compared to 
those of its uncontrolled and passive counterparts. 
Finally, conclusions are presented. 
II. SEMI-ACTIVE FRICTION TUNED 
MASS DAMPER (SAF-TMD) 
Configuration of SAF-TMD 
In order to evaluate the performance of the 
proposed SAF-TMD, the seismic response of a 
prototype SAF-TMD was tested via an experiment 
using a shaking table. Figure 1 is a schematic 
diagram of the prototype SAF-TMD, which mainly 
consists of a sliding platform and a piezoelectric 
friction damper (PFD) (Lu et al. 2010). The main 
components of the sliding platform are the guide 
rails, sliding blocks and springs. The springs provide 
not only stiffness and resilience, but also a tuning 
frequency. 
Figure 2 is a photograph of the interior layout 
of the PFD. The photograph shows that a 
piezoelectric actuator embedded in the PFD provides 
a controllable normal force (or called clamping force) 
between the friction pads and friction bar, so the 
friction force provided by the PFD can be regulated 
by a control law. When the SAF-TMD is excited 
during an earthquake, the friction force produced by 
the relative motion between the friction pad of the 
PFD and the friction bar will provide energy 
dissipation capability for the SAF-TMD, and as a 
result the response of primary structure and the 
TMD stroke can be attenuated.

Control of PFD 
Figure 2 is a control block diagram of the PFD. 
The figure shows that a voltage amplifier and a 
controller are usually needed to control the PFD. 
The controller can be a simple digital controller 
consisting of a micro-computer (or a PC) and an 
analog/digital (A/D) converter card. The 
micro-computer calculates the control command 
based on the sensor measurement of the current 
system response whereas the A/D card converts the 
computed digital command to an analog signal, 
which is usually a DC voltage below 10V. However, 
the piezoelectric actuator may require a driving DC 
voltage up to 1000V or higher; therefore, the control 
voltage provided by the controller is not sufficient to 
drive the piezoelectric actuator directly. Therefore, a 
voltage amplifier is needed to obtain a control

Figure 3 shows the mathematical model used 
for numerical analysis. The figure shows that the 
sliding platform of the SAF-TMD is modeled by a 
spring of stiffness ki and a friction element with 
friction coefficient μi. The former simulates stiffness 
due to the resilient mechanism whereas the latter 
models the friction effect of the guide rail of the 
sliding platform. Figure 3, however, shows that the 
PFD is modeled by a variable friction element with a 
friction coefficient μd, and the symbol kd denotes the 
axial stiffness of the PFD. The mass of the 
SAF-TMD and the primary structure are denoted by 
ms and mp, respectively. Moreover, the damping and 
stiffness of the primary structure are denoted by cp 
and kp, respectively. Relative-to-the-ground 
displacements of the SAF-TMD and the primary 
structure are denoted by xs and xp , respectively. 
Based on the mathematical model, the dynamic 
equation of the system can be rewritten as

displacement xp(t) and TMD stroke vs(t); )(txg  is 
the ground acceleration due to an earthquake; D2 and 
E1 denote the force placement matrices for the 
SAF-TMD system and the excitation, respectively. 
The matrices M, C and K represent the mass, 
damping and stiffness matrices of the SAF-TMD 
control system, respectively. The friction forces 
(damper forces) of the PFD and sliding platform are 
denoted by ud(t) and ui(t), respectively. Moreover, 
the forces denoted by ud(t) and ui(t) on the 
right-hand side of Eq. (6) are the nonlinear friction 
effects of the SAF-TMD. Note that ud(t) is the 
controllable damper force provided by the PFD, ui(t) 
is an uncontrollable nonlinear force. Therefore, the 
dynamic response of the SAF-TMD system can be 
attenuated by altering the force ud(t) in real time. For 
the purpose of numerical simulation in this study, the 
Coulomb friction law is assumed to govern friction 
material behavior in the damper and sliding platform, 
and the friction materials are assumed to have an 
equal static and dynamic friction coefficient. When 
friction force terms ud(t) and ui(t) are included in the 
model of a structure controlled by a SAF-TMD, the 
model becomes nonlinear, and numerical methods 
are generally needed to analyze the dynamic 
behavior of the system. This study therefore applies 
shear balance method (SBM), a numerical method of 
simulating a structure equipped with a friction-type 
TMD. The SBM is widely used to simulate dynamic 
response in structures with friction-type devices 
such as friction damper (Lu et al. 2006) or friction 
isolator (Wang et al. 1998). The SBM has proven 
efficient and generally accurate in analyzing 
structures with frictional devices. Lin et al. 2010c 
comprehensively discussed the formulation and 
application of an SBA algorithm in analysis of 
friction-type TMDs.

IV. SHAKING TABLE TEST PROGRAM 
System identification of the SAF-TMD and the 
primary structure 
The performance of the proposed SAF-TMD 
system was evaluated by shaking table test 
performed at the earthquake simulation laboratory of 
the National Center for Research on Earthquake 
Engineering (NCREE), Taipei, Taiwan. Figure 4 
shows the setup for the shaking table test. The figure 
shows that the prototype SAF-TMD was placed on 
the top of a primary structure. The mass of the 
7 
and on the SAF-TMD. Additionally, two LVDTs 
were used to measure the relative-to-the-ground 
displacement of the primary structure and the TMD 
stroke. A load cell was embedded in the PFD to 
measure normal force N(t) (Figure 2). The 1940 El 
Centro earthquake was applied in the shaking table 
test as the ground acceleration. 
V. TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Comparison of experimental and theoretical results 
This section reports the experimental findings 
of the shaking table test. To ensure accurate 
experimental results, the test data were first verified 
by the theoretical results simulated by SBM. 
Additionally, acceleration signals measured by an 
accelerometer placed directly on the shaking table 
were used as input to simulate ground excitations. 
Figure 7 compares the experimental and simulated 
responses of the SAF-TMD system subjected to the 
El Centro earthquake (PGA=500gal). Note that each 
figure contains six sub-figures in the following 
sequence: (a) time-history of the structural 
displacement xp(t), (b) time-history of the absolute 
acceleration of the primary structure, (c) 
time-history of the TMD, (d) time-history of the 
normal force N(t), (e) total shear force of the 
SAF-TMD Ss(t) vs. TMD stroke vs(t), (f) damper 
force ud(t) of the PFD vs. TMD stroke vs(t). 
Sub-figures (e) and (f) of Figure 7 also show the 
hysteretic behaviors of the SAF-TMD and PFD, 
respectively. In Figure 7, the following observations 
can be made: (1) all measurement data are consistent 
with the predicted SAF-TMD system behavior, i.e., 
the test data are reliable, and numerical method is 
effective for analyzing SAF-TMD system dynamic 
response. (2) Figure 7(d) demonstrates that the 
normal force N(t) of the PFD damper has been 
altered by the embedded piezoelectric actuator. This 
behavior differs from the constant normal force 
typically observed in a PF-TMD. This also implies 
that the slip force of the PFD has been altered by the 
actuator. (3) Due to the complicated friction 
behavior as well as measurement noise, the 
discrepancy in the experimental and theoretical 
hysteresis loops of the PFD (Figure 7(f)) is relatively 
larger than that in other system responses. 
Nevertheless, this discrepancy does not significantly 
affect the global responses of the SAF-TMD because 
for both the displacement and acceleration responses, 
the experimental results are consistent with the 
theoretical results (sub-Figs. (a) and (b) in Figure 7).

Definition of performance indices 
The comparison results were quantified by 
performance evaluations of the SAF-TMD system in 
terms of the five performance indices (J1-J5) in Table 
2. The indices J1 and J3 in Table 2 represent the peak 
response ratios of the structural displacement xp(t) 
and structural acceleration of the SAF-TMD system, 
respectively. The indices J2 and J4 represent the 
root-mean-square (RMS) response ratios of xp(t) and 
)(, tx ap , respectively. Performance index J5 represents 
the peak TMD stroke of the SAF-TMD. Notably, 
indices J1 to J4 were all divided by the 
corresponding response values of the uncontrolled 
system (primary structure only), which are 
represented by symbols with a top bar in Table 2. 
Therefore, for indices J1 to J4, a value less than one 
implies that the SAF-TMD system has a lower 
response than that of the uncontrolled system. 
Comparison of SAF-TMD and uncontrolled system 
responses 
To demonstrate the control efficiency of the 
SAF-TMD, this subsection compares the 
experimental seismic responses of the SAF-TMD 
system to the simulated responses of its uncontrolled 
counterpart system (primary structure only). In the 
uncontrolled system, simulated responses were used 
instead of experimental ones for two reasons: (1) the 
9 
the simulated responses for two passive systems 
(PF-TMD-1 and PF-TMD-2). Theoretically, when 
using the SAF-TMD model, the response of a 
PF-TMD can be simulated by pre-selecting an 
equivalent pre-compression force N0 and then setting 
the control voltage V(t)=0. Table 4 lists the 
equivalent N0 for these two PF-TMD systems. For 
the PF-TMD-1, N0 is set to 130 N, which is exactly 
equal to N0 of the SAF-TMD used in the test. 
Restated, PF-TMD-1 may represent an uncontrolled 
SAF-TMD. On the other hand, N0 of the PF-TMD-2 
is selected such that the TMD results in a peak 
stroke equal to that of the SAF-TMD for a given 
ground motion. Therefore, N0 of the PF-TMD-2 
differs for different PGA levels in Table 4. Figure 8 
compares the RMS responses (J2 and J4, respectively) 
and peak TMD stroke (J5) of the three TMD systems 
when data for the the selected earthquake is applied 
with different PGA levels. Note that the plots are for 
the experimental data for the SAF-TMD, and only 
the tested PGA levels are shown. Additionally, the 
data for PF-TMD-1 and PF-TMD-2 in Figure 8, 
respectively, are simulation data. The two figures 
confirm that, (1) for the range of the PGA levels 
tested, both the displacement and acceleration 
performance of the PF-TMD-1 are superior to those 
of the SAF-TMD and PF-TMD-1and that, (2) with a 
lower damping force, the PF-TMD-1 has the best 
control performance among the three systems; 
however, it also results in a peak stroke much higher 
than those of the SAF-TMD and PF-TMD-2, 
especially in earthquakes with high PGA. The 
maximum stroke for the SAF-TMD observed in the 
test is only 0.15m. (3) With the same peak TMD 
strokes, both the displacement and acceleration 
performance of the SAF-TMD are superior to those 
of the PF-TMD-2 cases. Figure 9 compares the time 
histories of the structural displacement and TMD 
stroke for the SAF-TMD and PF-TMD-2 systems 
subjected to the El Centro earthquake (PGA=500gal). 
The figure shows that the SAF-TMD is more 
effective in suppressing the structural displacement 
compared to the PF-TMD-2, which has the same 
peak TMD stroke (0.12m). Furthermore, the 
SAF-TMD can also prevent a residual TMD stroke, 
which is observed in the PF-TMD-2 system.

二、與會心得 
參加此次會議的兩岸專家學者具有各種不同專長及專業背景，大家就共通問題交換
意見，場面熱烈，獲益良多。尤其是大會所安排的 Keynote Lectures 與 Invited Lectures，
皆是兩岸相關研究人員的一時之選。另外，參加此次研討會後可以發現，大陸地區經濟
轉強之後，大量興建公共工程建設，其中包含高速鐵路、大壩、大型體育館等，許多大
型建設之複雜性與難度皆相當高，而許多大陸的研究人員獲得政府的重用，參與分析與
設計的工作，造就許多產學合作的成功案例。不過，由於同一時間的大量建設，且有些
是無前例可循的，因此還需時間來驗證其可靠度。國內各大工程研究機構在近年來亦投
入相當大的人力、物力、財力，將各種研究成果及技術實際應用於高塔、建築物、橋樑
等結構物上，透過兩岸的研究交流，可提升兩岸工程技術的水平。 
 
三、建議 
下一屆海峽兩岸結構與岩土工程學術研討會將於台灣舉行，期盼更多國內研究人員及研
究生參加此會議，增進交流學習的機會。

ABSTRACT 
 
A tuned mass damper (TMD) system is a device consisting of a mass, a spring and a damper attached to the 
structure to reduce the dynamic responses of the structure. The design and application of linear typed tuned 
mass damper systems are well developed. Nonlinear TMD systems are still under developing. A friction-type 
TMD which is a nonlinear TMD has the advantages of energy dissipation via a friction mechanism. However, a 
passive-friction TMD (PF-TMD) has such disadvantages as a fixed and pre-determined slip load and may lose 
its tuning and energy dissipation capability while in stick state. In this paper, a semi-active friction TMD (SAF-
TMD) which consists of a mass and a semi-active friction device is employed to overcome these disadvantages. 
The friction force of the semi-active friction device is controllable. A shaking table test of the SAF-TMD system 
was conduced to illustrate its vibration control effectiveness. A non-sticking friction (NSF) control law was 
applied to control the SAF-TMD. The test results demonstrate that the dynamic responses are very consistent 
with the theoretical ones obtained from numerical simulation. This verifies the feasibility and efficiency of the 
SAF-TMD system for structural control.
