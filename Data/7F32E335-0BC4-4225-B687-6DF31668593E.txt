save the transmitting power [8]. Cooperation among nodes
has also been shown to achieve phenomenal bit error rate
(BER) improvements while maintaining the same information
rate, transmitting power, and utilized bandwidth [9]. Other
energy-efficient cooperative communication techniques can be
found in [10]–[13]. However, none of the aforementioned
cooperative communication schemes has ever addressed how
to select the partner station for cooperative transmission. In
addition, to the best of our knowledge, the optimality of the
partner selection has never been defined. Hence, in this paper,
we will define the optimality in the sense of carrying out
an uplink transmission, which specifies the average required
transmitting power among all SSs subject to the constraint
of the maximum allowable packet error probability at the
base station. Then we propose a new power-saving scheme by
providing a novel algorithm for selecting the optimal partner.
Since the single-hop uplink transmission is the basic WiMax
protocol, we focus on the power-saving issue for the single-
hop uplink transmission in this paper. The other reason to
consider the single-hop uplink transmission is that the single-
hop uplink transmission consumes much more power com-
pared to the data transmission between any pair of SSs. Our
idea of the proposed power-saving scheme for the single-
hop uplink transmission in WiMax is to dynamically pair
the SSs for cooperative transmission. Once a pair of partner
SSs is formed, we select the better communication link of
the two according to the channel condition and the network
topology. The average uplink transmitting power of each SS
can therefore be reduced since the SS with a better channel
condition can help its partner SS to undertake the uplink
transmission. According to the pre-specified quality-of-service
(QoS) such as maximum allowable packet error probability,
the desired signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at
the receiver end can be determined. Given the underlying
network topology and the channel state information, the
uplink transmitting power per coded bit at each SS can be
computed. The optimal pairing (matching) scheme is built on
the proposed minimum weight matching algorithm. Our nu-
merical results demonstrate the significant power-consumption
improvement of the WiMax mesh network using our proposed
new scheme over the conventional method which involves the
direct transmission of each SS. Two similar works related
to this paper are addressed as follows. In [14], the partner-
selection schemes in the distributed and centralized protocols
for the cooperative communications in wireless networks
were considered. The outage probability was also derived
to evaluate the performances for the proposed protocols.
Different from the work presented in [14], our optimal partner-
selection method is based on the power-saving objective. The
work in [15] concerned about the partner-selection problem
in the centralized networks, where a BS assigns a partner
for each node and schedules all the transmissions. Three
optimal partner-selection strategies to reach different aims
were proposed and analyzed subject to the fixed and variable
transmit powers [15]. The corresponding objectives were max-
imum total utility (MTU) strategy, maximum minimum utility
(MMU) strategy and maximum product utility (MPU) strategy.
It was shown in [15] that with variable transmit power, both
system-level efficiency and node-level fairness could be greatly
improved. However, no illustrative algorithm to implement the
proposed strategies was provided and the required transmitting
power by each SS was not related to the network topology
and the wireless channel conditions in [15]. Thus, in this
paper, we will introduce a novel power-saving scheme in the
new mathematical paradigm which relates the the required
transmitting power spent by each SS to the network topology
and the wireless channel conditions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
the basic description of the WiMax mesh mode and the
scheduling algorithms will be presented. The formulation of
the transmitting power measure and the associated constrained
optimization problem are established for cooperative commu-
nications in Section III. Then we convert this optimization
problem into the formulation of a matching problem in Sec-
tion III as well. The corresponding algorithm for solving this
matching problem is provided in Section IV. The numerical
results are manifested in Section V to show that our proposed
scheme is very promising. Concluding remarks will be finally
drawn in Section VI. A preliminary brief version of this paper
can be found in [16].

II. WIMAX SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
In this section, we will provide a basic introduction of the
WiMax system and then propose a novel power-saving scheme
using cooperative uplink transmission.
A. PMP and Mesh Modes in WiMax
WiMax System provides two kinds of topologies for the
connection between the SSs and the BS, namely the point-
to-multipoint (PMP) mode and the mesh mode. The original
IEEE 802.16 standard addressed the applications in the li-
censed bands in the 10-66 GHz frequency range under the
PMP mode. Subsequent amendments have extended the IEEE
802.16 air interface to cover non line-of-sight (NLOS) applica-
tions in both licensed and unlicensed bands in the subbands of
11 GHz and enable the mesh mode. In the PMP mode, all SSs
are coordinated by a centralized service provider, namely the
BS. The WiMax standard supports frequency-division duplex
(FDD) and time-division duplex (TDD) transmission modes.
In the TDD mode, a MAC frame is divided into uplink

procedure for our proposed cooperative transmission scheme
is described as follows:
1) (Channel State and Network Information Estimation) In
this step, we will estimate two things. The channel state
estimation for the wireless links between each SS and
the BS according to [18]. The location estimation of
each SS within the network realm served by the BS can
be carried out according to [19]. From Eqs. (4) and (5)
and the estimated information about the channel state
as well as the network topology, we can calculate the
energy-cost values for each pair of SSs in cooperative
transmission.
2) (Matching) Once the cost values between each pair of
SSs are obtained, we can perform the minimum weight
matching algorithm as described in Section IV-C to
choose the optimal set of master SSs and the associated
set of slave SSs accordingly.
3) (Transmission) The first phase of the cooperative trans-
mission is from each slave SS to its master SS. After
this phase, the master SSs will transmit their own data
packets together with the data packets from the slave SSs
to the BS. A cooperative transmission cycle is completed
if the master SS finishes its transmission to the BS.
4) (Restart) After a cooperative transmission cycle is com-
plete, the BS will collect the data packets from each SS
again and restart the entire procedure.
In the next section, we will formulate an objective function
of the minimum average power consumption of each SS
based on channel conditions and network configurations. The
solution of this objective function is used to choose the best
half of the uplink transmissions among all SSs.
III. TRANSMITTING ENERGY-COST FUNCTION
In this section, we will formulate the cost function for the
required transmitting power according to the desired SINR.
This cost function will lead to the constrained optimization.
The Gilbert-Elliott channel model in [20], [21] is widely
adopted for time-varying environments. Two states are used
to characterize the channel condition, namely the state for
good channel condition is designated by G and the state for
bad channel condition is designated by B. For each state,
we model the channel as an additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel and assume that the channel gain at the
good state is HG while the channel gain at the bad state is HB
(|HG| > |HB |). We assume that the transition probability from
a good state to a bad state after a cooperative transmission
cycle is pG,B and the transition probability from a bad state
to a good state after a cooperative transmission cycle is pB,G
instead. Therefore, the stationary probabilities for the channel
to stay at the good state, denoted as PG, and for the channel
to stay at the bad state, denoted as PB , can be expressed as
PG =
pB,G
pB,G + pG,B
, PB =
pG,B
pB,G + pG,B
. (1)
The means to determine the channel condition parameters
subject to the Gilbert-Elliott channel model can be found
in [22] and the references therein.
OFDM is the underlying modulation for the WiMax sys-
tems. The OFDMA system performance can be directly related
to the SINR, which is carried out on a single sub-carrier of
the reference user. In our derivation of energy consumption,
the interference due to the OFDMA-modulation based users
to perform the uplink connection with the base station is
denoted as Iup while the interference due to the users to
perform the intra-transmission (between master and slave SSs)
is denoted as Iin. The quantities of Iup and Iin can be
evaluated according to the bad channel condition [23]. The
reason for evaluating the interference under the bad channel
condition is to guarantee the required transmitting energy to
satisfy the desired SINR. Let Ei be the transmitting energy
required per coded bit of user i for the uplink transmission
and ei,j be the transmitting energy required per coded bit from
user i to user j for the intra-transmission between these two
users. The distance from the i-th user to the base station is
denoted as Di and the distance between the i-th user and the
j-th user is represented as di,j . The value of α represents the
decay factor with respect to the transmission distance. Then
the SINR associated with the uplink transmission for the i-th
SS (user), denoted as ρup(i), can be expressed as
ρup(i) =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
EiD

i |HG|2
N0+Iup
, if the channel
condition is good.
EiD
−α
i |HB |2
N0+Iup
, if the channel
condition is bad.
(2)
Similarly, the SINR for the intra-transmission from user i to
user j, denoted as ρin(i, j), can be expressed as
ρin(i, j) =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
ei,jd

condition is good.

i,j |HB |2
N0+Iin
, if the channel
condition is bad.
(3)
According to Eqs. (2), (3), the SINR ρup(i) varies with
respect to Ei and the SINR ρin(i, j) varies with respect to
ei,j . Hence we can write
Ei =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
ρup(i)(N0+Iup)
D−αi |HG|2
, if the channel
condition is good.
ρup(i)(N0+Iup)
D−αi |HB |2
, if the channel
condition is bad.

and
ei,j =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨

, if the channel
condition is good.
ρin(i,j)(N0+Iin)
d−αi,j |HB |2
, if the channel
condition is bad.
(5)
The consumed energy βi,j per coded bit after choosing the
i-th SS as the master SS and the j-th SS as the slave by the
matching procedure will be
βi,j = 2Ei + ej,i. (6)

IV. MATCHING ALGORITHM FOR COOPERATIVE
TRANSMISSION
Matching problems have long been investigated in combi-
natorial analysis. Basically, there are two types of matching
problems. One is bipartite matching where two pre-classified
groups are to be matched. The other is non-bipartite matching
where items without pre-classified groups are to be matched.
Before we present the matching algorithm, some needed ter-
minologies and mechanisms for processing the graphs will be
discussed first. The following contents are modified from [26].
A. Nodes Labeling and Augmentation
If a node is not matched, it is said to be an exposed node.
For a given matching X , an alternating path is an undirected
path of the edges which are alternately in X and not in X . An
augmented path is an alternating path between two exposed
nodes.
For a given bipartite graph Gh = (S, T ,A) and a given
matching X ⊆ A, we define an alternating tree relative
to the matching as a tree which satisfies the following two
conditions. S-label and T -label nodes represent the nodes in
the set S and T , respectively. First, the tree contains exactly
one exposed node from S, which we call its root. Second,
all paths between the root and any other node in the tree are
alternating paths. The computational procedure starts with the
empty matching. Each exposed node in S is considered as
the root of an alternating tree and nodes and edges are added
to the trees by means of a labeling procedure. The labeling
procedure is stated as follows:
1) Assign the label ”∅” to each exposed node in S.
2) If there are no unscanned labels, the labeling procedure
terminates. Otherwise, find a node i with an unscanned
label. If i ∈ S, go to Step 3; if i ∈ T , go to Step 4.
3) Scan the label on node i for i ∈ S. For each edge (i, j)
not in X and incident to node i, give node j the label
”˜i” unless node j has already been labeled. Go back to
Step 2.
4) Scan the label on node i for i ∈ T . If node i ∈ T is
exposed, go to Step 3. Otherwise, identify the unique
edge (i, j) incident to node i and give node j the label
”˜i”. Go back to Step 2.
From the above labeling procedure, an augmented path can
be found. The terminating node in this path is denoted as
i. The nodes preceding node i in the path are identified by
backtracing. For example, if the label on node i is ”j˜”, the
second-to-last node in this augmented path is j. If the label on
node j is ”k˜”, the third-to-last node in this augmented path
is k, and so on. The initial node in the path has the label

nodes 6-10 belong to T ).
”∅”. Augment X by adding all edges in the augmented path,
which are not in X originally. Remove all labels from nodes
and relabel nodes according to the aforementioned labeling
procedure.
Eventually, one of the following two events must occur.
Either an exposed node in T is added to one of the alternating
trees, or else it is not possible to add more nodes and edges to
any of the alternating trees. In the former case, the matching
is augmented and the relabeling procedure is repeated with
respect to the new matching. In the latter case, no augmented
paths exist and the labeling of the graph for this event is called
Hungarian.
As an example, consider the matching shown in Figure 2, in
which wavy lines represent edges in the matching and straight
lines are not edges in the matching. Alternating trees are
constructed, with the exposed S-nodes 1 and 5 as roots, as
shown in Figure 3. An augmented path is found, as indicated
in the figure. The augmented matching is shown in Figure 4.
When an alternating tree is constructed for the augmented
matching, as shown in Figure 5, it becomes Hungarian.
B. Blossoms
An elegant solution to the problem of finding augmented
paths for the minimum weight matching problem has been de-
vised by Edmonds [26]. Briefly, Edmonds’ approach involves
the construction of alternating trees by detecting a certain odd
cycles called ”blossoms” and ”shrinking” these blossoms by
contraction of the graph. The formal definition of a blossom
is given below.
Definition 1: Let X be a matching in the graph Gh =
(N ,A). Let NB ⊆ N be a subset of 2r+1 nodes, r ≥ 1, and
let B be the set of all edges such that the both ends of which
are incident to the nodes in NB. B is said to be a blossom
with respect to the matching X if
|X ∩ B| = r, (15)

values of ui and zk yield an optimal dual solution. Otherwise,

Step 1.
V. NUMERICAL EVALUATION
In our numerical evaluation, we assume that the numbers of
SSs range from 100 to 300 and they are randomly deployed
in a circular region with radius 50 km. Two decay factors
are assumed in the following evaluations, namely α = 2
and α = 3. The channel condition for the good state is
quantified as |HG| = 1. Different values |HB| = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4
for the bad state are selected. In order to calculate the required
transmitting power, the targeted packet error rate (PER) varies
from 10−12 to 1. The probability PG for the channel to stay at
the good state varies from 0 to 1 in our numerical evaluation.
The BPSK and QPSK are two underlying modulation schemes
adopted for evaluation. Two convolutional codes with rate 12
and 34 are used as the error control schemes in our system.
The minimum required SINR for satisfying such an allowable
PER with respect to different coding and modulation schemes
can be determined according to [27]. Here we investigate
the effects of channel characteristics, coding/modulation op-
tions and network topology on the power consumption and
then compare our proposed scheme using the cooperative
transmission based on the new minimum weight matching
algorithm with the conventional method in which all SSs
directly transmit to the BS simultaneously. The conventional
method is briefed as ”convent.” while our proposed new
scheme using the optimal matching is briefed as ”opt. mat.”
in the following figures. The third method in comparison is
the cooperative transmission using the arbitrary (non-optimal)
matching which is briefed as ”ran. mat.” in the figures. In
addition, the convolutional coding with different coding rates
is briefed as ”conv” in the figures. The implementation details
for our proposed new scheme can be found in Section IV-C.
We will compare the average required transmitting powers
among the aforementioned schemes for each SS to achieve a

such as channel condition, modulation/coding option, network
topology, are considered in the following sub-sections.
A. Channel Effects
In this sub-section, we illustrate the average required trans-
mitting power among all the SSs given the channel state
information to achieve a targeted PER at the receiver end
in Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9. We depict the average required
transmitting power (briefed as ”Ave. Req. Tx. Power”) with
respect to PG which specifies the ratio of good channel-links
to all the channel-links in the mesh network. From Figures 6-9,
it is noted that our proposed new scheme can achieve a much
lower average required transmitting power than the other two
methods.
Figure 6 illustrates the average required transmitting power
versus PG to compare the three aforementioned methods.
As Figure 6 shows, the average required transmitting power
monotonically decreases when PG increases from 0 to 1 for
all methods. The average required transmitting powers for the
conventional method decreases from −55 dBm to −80 dBm

C. Network Topologies
In this section, we delineate the average required trans-
mitting power versus Ω, which denotes the distance from
the geometric center of the circular region in where all
SSs are located to the BS. Figures 13, 14, 15 are drawn
with PG = 3/4. Figure 13 illustrates the average required
transmitting power versus Ω. According to Figure 13, the
average required transmitting power is about −72 dBm by
the conventional method while it is about −74 dBm by the
random matching scheme and about −83 dBm by the optimal
matching scheme. The transmitting power-saving margin over
the conventional method is about 11 dBm by our proposed
optimal matching scheme and 2 dBm by the random matching
scheme. It indicates that our proposed new scheme greatly
outperforms the other two methods.
In Figures 14 and 15, we change the targeted PER to
10−4 and 10−2, respectively. Comparing with Figure 13,
the trends of these three figures look similar. The average
required transmitting power increases when Ω becomes large.

VI. CONCLUSION
Different from many existing power-saving schemes based
on the scheduling algorithms for the IEEE 802.16 WiMax
systems, we propose a novel power-saving scheme built on
the cooperative uplink transmission for the WiMax mesh
mode in this paper. Given the maximum allowable packet
error probability, we define a cost function of the required
transmitting power. We formulate a constrained optimization
problem subject to the packet error rate accordingly. Since
we consider the pair-wise cooperative transmission, this opti-
mization problem can be converted into a matching problem.
Then the minimum weight matching algorithm is adopted and
modified to carry out the optimal solution. Our numerical
results show the significant power-consumption improvement
using our proposed new scheme over the conventional method
when three different factors are considered, namely channel
effects, coding/modulation option and network topology. The
future work from this line of our proposed research involves
the studies of the scalability and mobility issues. Moreover,
the node grouping with the relay techniques such as network
coding other than the node matching would also be emerging
and interesting.
