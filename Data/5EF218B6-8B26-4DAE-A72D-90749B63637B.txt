assets and there is a risk-free asset; all assets are normally distributed; the single-period
market is partially complete; all individuals have quadratic utility functions.
For easy reference, we follow the settings in Luenberger’s paper (Ref. 2). Consider a
single period model with n risky assets and one risk-free asset in the market. Let the
price for risk-free asset be 1 and the corresponding prices of n risky assets be denoted by
p1, p2, . . . , pn at time t = 0. The gross return of the risk-free asset is R and let R˜ denote
the payoff of the risk-free asset at time 1. Payoffs of n risky assets at time 1 are denoted
by d1, d2, · · · , dn. Let W denote the investor’s initial wealth. There is a non-marketable
new asset with payoff e. If its price pe is given, the investor’s decisions can be derived
from the following problem.
max E[U(x)]
s.t. p1α1 + · · ·+ pnαn + αf + peαe = W,
d1α1 + · · ·+ dnαn + R˜αf + eαe = x,
(1)
where decision variables α1, α2, · · · , αn, αf , αe form a portfolio for the n risky assets, risk-
free asset, and the new asset respectively. Luenberger (Ref. 2) shows that assume no
arbitrage is possible in the market, n risky assets and one risk-free asset are linearly
independent, and e is nonnegative and linear independent of those n + 1 assets. If the
utility function is strictly concave and continuously differentiable and the optimal solution
x∗ is positive to problem (1), then there exists a unique zero-level price, p0e. Furthermore,
the zero-level price can be written as
p0e =
1
R
E[U ′(x∗)e]
E[U ′(x∗)]
. (2)
In this note, we consider the universal property for the zero-level price with respect
to the HARA utility function. The HARA utility function is defined by
U(x) =
1− γ
γ
( ax
1− γ + b
)γ
(3)
where
a > 0,
ax
1− γ + b > 0, x > 0.
It is well-known that if γ → −∞ and b = 1, then U(x) = − exp(−ax). If γ → 0, then
U(x) = log(ax + b)4. Note that we don’t consider the cases with γ = 0 or 1. Thus we
restrict to our discussion only on strictly concave HARA utility functions.
In the following section, we discuss the universal property of zero-level price for CARA
form, log form, and power form of HARA utility functions, respectively. We shall show

log(ax+ b) = lim

The value of λ∗ is obtained from (7) and is used in equation (6). Since a and exp(−aR˜W )

2, · · · ,m∗n,m∗f are independent of a and W . Furthermore,
A is independent of a and W as well.
Proposition 2.1. Suppose all investors in the market have CARA utility functions,
then the zero-level prices are universal.
Proof. Consider an investor with utility function U(x) = − exp(−ax) and initial
wealth W . Suppose (α∗1, α

2, · · · , α∗n, α∗f , 0) is his/her optimal portfolio corresponding to
the situation with zero-level price imposed on the new asset, we can rewrite α∗i as m

f/a. It follows from Lemma 1 that A is independent of a and W . Since
equations (7) and (8) together determine the zero-level price as
p0e =
E
[
a exp(−a( 1
a
A+ R˜W ))e

E
[
a exp(−a( 1
a

R

E[exp(−A)e]
E[exp(−A)]R. (12)
Hence, the zero-level price is independent of a andW . We conclude that it is universal.
Example 2.1. In this numerical example, there are three states and the probability
to each state is 1/3. Two assets exist in this world, one is a risky asset and the other is
a risk-free asset. The price of the risky asset is equal to $2 with payoff $1, $2, and $3
corresponding to each state. The price of risk-free asset is equal to $1 with payoff $1.1
in every state. There is a new asset, which is non-marketable, and its payoff is $0, $0,
and $1 corresponding to each state. We calculate the zero-level price under the different
parameters of the utility functions and the different levels of initial wealth. Table 1 shows
the zero-level price is equal to 0.399 and it is universal indeed. Moreover, Table 1 also
below are necessary and sufficient conditions for it to satisfy.

Proposition 2.2. Suppose all investors in the market have log utility functions, then
the zero-level prices are universal.
Proof. Consider an investor with utility function U(x) = log(ax + b) and initial

Since a, b, and W do not appear in B, zero-level price is universal.
Example 2.2. Following the setup of Example 1, we consider the log utility func-
tions. We calculate the zero-level price under the different parameters, b (Panel A) and
a (Panel B), of the log utility functions and the different levels of initial wealth. Table
2 shows that the zero-level price is equal to 0.403 and it is universal indeed. Moreover,
the corresponding optimal positions on the risky asset and risk-free asset are reported
in Table 2. When a = 1, b = 1, and W = 1, the optimal positions for risky asset and
risk-free assets are -0.650 and 2.300 respectively.
where B is defined as (14). Since U is strictly concave, the optimal solution is unique
for problem (1). And it can be completely determined by the following Kuhn-Tucker
conditions.

Proposition 2.3. Suppose all investors have the HARA utility functions of power
form with a common fixed γ, then the zero-level prices are universal.
Proof. Consider an investor with the power form HARA utility function and initial
wealth W . Suppose (α∗1, α

2, · · · , α∗n, α∗f , 0) is his/her optimal portfolio corresponding to
the situation with zero-level price imposed on the new asset, we can rewrite α∗i as m

p0e =

Hence, the zero-level price is independent of a, b, and W . In the other words, if the
parameter γ is fixed, the zero-level price is universal in this case.

utility functions. We calculate the zero-level price under the different parameters, b (Panel
