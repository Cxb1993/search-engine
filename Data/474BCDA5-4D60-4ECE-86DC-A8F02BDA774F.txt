DEM, each of these bit lines controls one specific 
unit element of the DAC. A one-to-one 
correspondence exists between the input-code of 
the DAC and the error. When DEM is used, this 
one-to-one correspondence is broken by the 
element selection block. Use Data Weighted 
Averaging (DWA) of DEM techniques were 
presented in [3].Instead of using a separate 
register for each possible input code, DWA uses 
only one register which is common to all input 
codes. The register always points to the first 
unused unit element. DWA rotates through all the 
elements such that all the elements are used at the 
maximum possible rate and each element is used 
the same number of times. This ensures that the 
error introduced by the DAC quickly average to 
zero, moving distortion to high frequencies. At 
each clock cycle, this pointer, ptr, is update by the 
input code [4] : 
ptr(k)=[ptr(k-1)+x(k)]/N                (1) 
 The cells selected at time k are the cells 
labeled from ptr(k-1) to ptr(k) by increasing order. 
The mismatch errror at time k is then given by : 
if ptr(k)>=ptr(k-1)

Equation (2)(3) can be written in the form :

with IM(ptr) being a function of the pointer on the 
array called the Integral Mismatch function. This

It is proven analytically that DWA provides 
first-order shaping of the DAC error. Due to the 
simplicity of the algorithm, little digital hardware 
is required and it is suitable for high-speed 
converters. A drawback of DWA is the 
degradation for a small range of input signals due 
to signal dependent tones. [5] 
 
3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
Fig. 4 shows the second order modulator 
architecture, which provides the second order 
noise shaping performance. The unity gain 
approximation states that the product of the 
integrator gains along the outer feedback loop and 
the effective quantizer gain, G, is unity. Thus, 
under the unity gain approximation, G in Fig. 3 is 
equal to 1. To implement the modulator of Fig. 2 
without saturating the first integrator, and with the 
reasonable feedback reference levels, signal 
scaling must be employed. Fig. 4 illustrates the 
block diagram of a 2nd-order modulator wherein a 
scaling factor is applied to each integrator input 
and feedback path.

Fig. 10 Integrator and DAC capacitances. 
 
During the integrating phase, the feedback 
DAC operates by connecting the bottom terminal 
of each unit capacitance to either 
refV+  or 
refV− . 
 
III. OP and CMFB 
 
  Since all the switches are implemented as 
transmission gates, this requires 4 control signals 
for each unit capacitance. These 64 signals need 
to be distributed from the output of the 
DWA-block to each feedback DAC. This would 
require much power in the buffers (due to the 
wiring capacitance) and a large area-overhead for 
the wiring. In order to reduce the number of 
feedback signals and the power to drive them, the 
local switch driver is used in front of each unity 
capacitance integrators ultimately limits the 
achievable sampling rate of the modulator, even if 
complete settling is not required. Slew-rate 
limiting represents a departure from linear 
settling and must be avoid. [7] 
 
  The need for fast settling, coupled with a 
relatively modest gain requirement of 60 dB to 
suppress harmonic distortion, encouraged the use 
of the folded-cascode operational amplifier shown 
in Fig. 11. The common-mode output level of the 
amplifier is maintained by the switched-capacitor 
feedback circuitry shown in Fig. 12. Capacitors 
Cc form a voltage divider to drive the gates of the 
NMOS current source transistors in the output 
stage. Only changes in the common-mode output 
are coupled to the gates of the NMOS current 
source transistors in the output stage, which 
returns the common-mode output voltage to the 
desired level through negative feedback.

During phase 2, corrective changes are 
transferred onto Cc from refresh capacitors to 
prevent drift in the common-mode output voltage. 
 
IV. DWA Control Logic 
 
The DWA algorithm requires a block to rotate 
the thermometer output code of the quantizer, a 
pointer to the first unused unit element and a 
method to update the pointer with the output of 
the quantizer. The implement of the DWA 
algorithm is critical for the achievable clock speed 
of the converter, since it adds additional delays in 
the feedback loop of the converter. 
 
The implementation of the DWA algorithm is 
shown in Fig.13. A logarithmic shifter is used in
