Abstract 
Currently, with the tremendous growth 
in cellular wireless communication and 
enormous increment of multimedia services, 
the sparse radio frequency spectrum 
becomes a more and more valuable resource. 
Consequently, a major task for future 
wireless communication system will be to 
effectively increase spectrum efficiency and 
improve link quality. The Multiple-Input 
Multiple-Output (MIMO) signal processing 
techniques recently have drawn considerable 
attentions as they stand out with the promise 
of significant link quality enhancement and 
huge system capacity increase by exploiting 
the spatial resource without sacrificing 
bandwidth. In addition, since CDMA with 
the advantages of interference suppression 
and substantial improvement in the system 
capacity has become the next generation 
cellular mobile communication standards, 
the main purpose of this project is focused 
on developing a novel blind CDMA receiver 
incorporating the MIMO techniques. 
In this project, a novel non-data aided 
MIMO receiver with enhanced interference 
suppression is proposed for Space-Time 
Block Coding (STBC) CDMA systems over 
a frequency-selective multipath channel. 
The design of the proposed scheme involves 
the following procedure. An adaptive 
correlator is first constructed based on the 
linearly constrained minimum variance 
(LCMV) criterion to collect each multipath 
signal and suppress multiple access 
interference (MAI). A maximum ratio 
combiner is then utilized to coherently 
combine the correlator outputs. With a set of 
judicious chosen weight vectors, effective 
diversity combining can successfully 
suppress MAI and the desired signals can be 
effectively retained. Further robustness 
improvement against the finite data sample 
effect is achieved using a decision-aided 
scheme, in which the channel responses are 
obtained by the decision data and 
incorporated with the MMSE method. 
Finally, STBC decoding is used to retrieve 
the transmitted data. To sum up, since the 
STBC structure has been judiciously 
exploited in the receiver design, the 
proposed non-data aided receiver can 
promise both the advantages of MIMO and 
CDMA techniques without the needs of the 
pilot symbols. The corresponding results 
will be confirmed by both theoretical 
analysis and computer simulations. 
Moreover, we will suggest a feasible and 
efficient solution to provide a better 
communication link for the STBC 
MIMO-CDMA systems.

一個通訊系統效能主要取決於解決多
重存取干擾(Multiple Access Interference,

而在實際時變的環境中，複合特徵向量並
無法正確地預先獲得，通常需藉由傳送訓

Abstract— In this paper, a non-data aided desired signal-
blocked interference-blocked (SBIB) receiver with enhanced
multiple access interference (MAI) suppression is proposed
over a multipath fading channel. Without pre-known data
used, the proposed receiver can offer the similar performance
as that of the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (MSINR) receiver with the channel estimation correctly
obtained beforehand. Computer simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed blind receiver can effectively resist MAI
and significantly outperform than the conventional receivers.
Keywords—multiple access interference (MAI), signal-
blocked interference-blocked (SBIB), maximum signal-to-
interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR)
I. INTRODUCTION
The capacity limitation in direct-sequence code-division
multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems is chiefly determined
by the interference level which arises from imperfect orthog-
onality among spreading codes. Signals from other users,
referred to as multiple access interference (MAI), with the
same transmission power as that of the desired user can
only cause minor interference at the receiver end because the
correlations among different spreading codes are small [1].
Unfortunately, in some CDMA systems, e.g. third generation
mobile radio system Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), differ-
ent services and different users may use channelization codes
of different spreading factors according to their required data
rates. For services with high data rate, the corresponding
transmission power has to be high in order to maintain the
required quality of service (QoS), which will become strong
interference for other users. Those cannot be efficiently
suppressed because of insufficient processing gains, leading
to substantial degradation in performance [2]-[3].
In this paper, a non-data aided desired signal-blocked
interference-blocked (SBIB) receiver with enhanced MAI
suppression is proposed over a multipath fading channel.
The design of the proposed receiver involves the following
procedure: A desired signal-blocked (SB) transformation is
constructed for alleviating the desired signals cancellation.
An interference-blocked (IB) transformation is then applied
to the SB transformed data to successfully suppress the
MAI blindly. The IB transformed data is sent to the maxi-
mum ratio combining (MRC) to achieve maximum signal-
to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Finally, the MRC
output is used to estimate the channel response and then to
obtain the fine-tuned weight vector. Numerical results indi-
cate that the proposed receiver exhibits robustness against
the MAI and significant performance improvement when
compared with the conventional methods.
II. PROPOSED NON-DATA AIDED SBIB RECEIVER
In this section, an SBIB receiver without using the pre-
known symbols is developed. Specifically, an SB transfor-
mation is first constructed to suppress the desired signals,
while the MAI and noise are retained as much as possible.
An IB transformation is then developed based on the SB
transformed data. Finally, the IB transformed data mostly
consisting of the desired signals and noise only is sent to
the optimal weight combining. The corresponding schematic
diagram is depicted in Fig. 1.
A. Data Model
Consider herein a synchronous CDMA system with K
users, whose signals are modulated by the binary phase shift
keying (BPSK) and each modulated signal is spread with a
unique signature waveform over an L-path fading channel.
Assuming user 1 to be the desired user, the chip-sampled
data over ith sample can be put into the (M − L + 1) × 1
vector [4]:
x(i)=
K∑
k=1
L∑
l=1
σkgk,lck,lbk(i)+n(i)=
K∑
k=1
bk(i)hk+n(i) (1)
where σk, gk,l and bk(i) denote the transmitted power, the
complex gain of the lth path and the transmitted information
bit, respectively, of the kth user, and n(i) is the sampled
AWGN with noise power σ2n. The (M + L − 1)× 1 vector
ck,l is the augmented signature vector associated with the
lth path of the kth user, given by
ck,l =
[
0Tl−1, ck[0], · · · , ck[M − 1], 0TL−l
]T
(2)
where T and 0n are the transpose operator and the
n × 1 zero vector, respectively. Finally, the vector hk =∑L
l=1 σkgk,lck,l is the effective composite signature vector
(CSV) of user k. Without loss of the generality, it is assumed
that user 1 is the desired user and the subscript index 1 will
be omitted for simplicity.

Since maximizing the signal-plus-noise-to-noise ratio is ef-
fectively the same as maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), we can rewrite (15) as
max
w
E{|wT˜x(i)|2}
E{|wHT˜n(i)|2} ≡
wHT˜RT˜w
wHT˜w
=
wHT˜h1hH1 T˜w
wHT˜w
(17)
Note that the second equality holds due to the approximation
in (14). Obviously, the optimization problem in (17) is
the same with that in (15). The corresponding solution
of Equation (17) is the dominant mode (the eigenvector
associated with maximum eigenvalue) of the eigen-equation
T˜RT˜ = ηT˜w (18)
where η denotes the largest eigenvalue of the above eigen-
equation. Ideally, the degradation of output SINR is mainly
caused by the components in the complement of the desired
signal subspace, i.e., the interference subspace [5]. Accord-
ing to (18), the optimum weight vector formed by projecting
the weight vector w onto the desired signal subspace, the
complement of the interference subspace, can boost the
output SINR and is given by
w˜ = T˜w (19)
Substituting (19) into (18), the optimum weight vector can
be obtained via the following eigen-equation
T˜RT˜w˜ ≈ T˜h1hH1 T˜w˜ + σ2nw˜ = ηw˜ (20)
where we have used the facts that the interference is almost
cancelled by T˜ and the equality T˜w˜ = w˜. It is easy to verify
from (20) that the modified eigen-equation has M + L − 2
identical eigenvalues equal to σ2n corresponding to the null
space of T˜h1, and the dominate mode corresponding to η =
hH1 T˜h1 + σ
2
n is given by
w˜ = T˜h1 = (I−EuEHu )h1 (21)
where we have omitted the normalizing constant.
E. Decision-Aided Channel Estimation
According to the weight vector in (21), the estimate of the
transmitted data can be obtained by bˆ1(i) = dec{w˜Hx(i)},
where dec{·} is the data decision operator. Next, the CSV
estimate can be obtained accordingly using the decision data
bˆ1(i) as follows:
hˆ1 =
1
Ns
Ns∑
i=1
x(i)bˆ1(i) (22)
where Ns is the number of the samples. Specifically, the
weight vector of the proposed SBIB receiver can be obtained
by using the MMSE method incorporating with the SB
transformed data in (4) and the estimation CSV hˆ1.
III. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS
Computer simulations were conducted to ascertain the
efficacy of the proposed SBIB receiver in a synchronous
CDMA system with ten users (K=10). For all users, the
BPSK-modulated signals were spread by random codes of
length M=32 through a four-path (L=4) Rayleigh fading
channel, in which the path delays were uniformly distributed,
and the path gains gk,l were independent, identically dis-
tributed unit variance complex Gaussian random variables.
As an index of performance evaluation, the input SNR and
near-far-ratio (NFR) were defined as SNRi = −10 log10 σ2n
and NFR = 10 log10{‖h1‖2/‖hk‖2}, respectively. Note that
all MAI power was assumed to be identical for simplicity.
In each simulation, a total of 103 independent trials was
executed to obtain the output SINR values, with each trial
using a different set of spreading codes, gk,l’s, and data/noise
sequences. Finally, unless otherwise mentioned, the follow-
ing standard parameters will be used throughout the section:
SNRi=0 dB, NFR=−10 dB, and Ns=100.
For performance comparison, the results obtained with
the fully data-aided MSINR [6] and MMSE receivers are
also included. The MSINR receiver is obtained by the time-
average version interference-plus-noise correlation matrix
incorporating the estimate CSV hˆ1 using the fully-known
transmitted data. The MMSE receiver is obtained similarly
with the MSINR receiver except that the interference-plus-
noise correlation matrix is replaced by the received data
correlation matrix.
In the first set of simulations, the output SINR per-
formance is evaluated as a function of input SNR. The
corresponding results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the
proposed SBIB receiver can successfully achieve the similar
performance as the MSINR receiver with a slight degradation
of 0.17 dB at input SNR=0 dB and significantly outperform
the MMSE receiver. The MMSE receiver offers a poor
performance due to the desired signal cancellation. On the
other hand, the proposed receiver successively approaches
the MSINR receiver, confirming that the proposed receiver
can coherently combine the multipath signals and effectively
suppress the MAI.
In the second set of simulations, the robustness of the
proposed receiver against MAI is examined with different
NFR values. As shown in Fig. 3, the proposed receiver with
the output SINR performance similar to the MSINR receiver
possesses an excellent near-far resistance by effectively
cancelling the strong MAI. It is noteworthy that the proposed
receiver performs a slight degradation at high input SIR. This
is because that the weaker MAI puts less emphasis on the SB
transformation in (6) and then leads a transformation error.
In the final set of simulations, the convergence behavior is
examined by varying the data sample size Ns for computing
the time -average version data correlation matrix. The results
given in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the proposed receiver with
the similar performance as the MSINR receiver converges in
about Ns=100 data symbols. On the other hand, the MMSE
