2coefficients. The common range of CN and the optimal coefficient values of the RI a 
relation are thereby sought. In addition, Mishra-Singh’s calibration parameters (Mishra and
Singh 1999) are theoretically determined based on this modified model, in order to provide
explanations for certain previously unexplainable phenomena in their articles. Discussion
proceeds with sand, silt loam, and clay as the objects. Lastly, a theoretical model of rainfall
excess following catchment urbanization is established by integrating the modified SCS
method on the basis of a unit hydrograph, and the corresponding rise in water level is
calculated with the concept of rating curve. All the results deduced are used to compare the
differences among the SCS method, the newly proposed modified model, and the modified
Mishra-Singh model. Suggestions are provided to tackle several disadvantages mentioned by
Ponce and Hawkins (1996).
2. Basic Equations
The SCS model mainly consists of a proportion and equation of continuity. The
proportion assumes that:
a

 (1)
where Fa = cumulative infiltration in soil after surface runoff occurs, R = potential maximum
retention or infiltration, Ia = initial abstraction before surface runoff occurs, Pe = rainfall
excess, and  = total rainfall; and
aae FIP  (2)
RI a  (3)
254
25400
CN
R (4)
where R is in millimeter. At present, the SCS method suggests 2.0 , and similar results
have been obtained from a series of experiments in small watersheds (Chow et al. 1988).
To determine theoretically the abstraction from storm rainfall, this research incorporates
a widely used infiltration model -- the Philip equation (Philip 1957) regarding it has less
limits on infiltration coefficients and soil-water diffusivity. The equation is recast into the
following form for practical use:
2/1
2
1
)(  StcKtg s (6)
where g(t) = potential infiltration rate, t = rainfall duration, S = soil sorptivity, Ks = saturated
permeability coefficient of the soil, and c is between 0.5 and 1.0, depending on the plant
canopy density and the longitudinal antecedent soil moisture (Sivapalan and Wood 1986); the
c value is smaller when the antecedent soil contains more moisture, and vice versa.
Rainfall intensity p is assumed constant in this study regarding the fact that if the SCS
method loses accuracy even under this optimal condition, it will definitely be unreliable in
real situations where rainfall intensity fluctuates. When the infiltration curve is known, as in
Equation (6), and rainfall intensity p is held constant, Ia can be derived after tp has been
determined. Furthermore, because the maximum of Fa is R, and Ia=0.2R, the maximum of Fa
is 5Ia. Therefore, the point in time that corresponds to the maximum of Fa on the infiltration
curve is exactly 5t . Since the actual infiltration rate becomes zero after this point in time, the
infiltration curve suddenly descends and meets the x coordinate. Hence, after the Philip
infiltration curve is so modified (see the curve variation trend in Figure 1), the “botomless”
phenomenon (Ponce and Hawkins 1996), which means g(t) in Equation (6) never becomes
zero, will be solved, and infinite storage of soil will also be prevented. Consequently,  , Ia,
Fa, and Pe can be expressed as the explicit functions of the time or ponding time which has a
4infiltration models is reduced to the minimum. The look-up table for CN values is still
borrowed from the classical work of Soil Conservation Service for the SCS method, where
CN and R are related by 254/25400  CNR (mm), and RIa 2.0 as usual. Plugging all the
values including (=pt) into Equation (27) gives the rainfall excess Pe. Equation (27) can be
further simplified to a model, analogous to the SCS method, with a fixed coefficient :
 
 a
a
e IR
I
P



2
(29)
where  ( 7.3 ) is going to be determined by numerical integration.
Supposing CN is unknown, Equation (27) is of great advantage to determine its values
theoretically. The result can be used to anti-verify the accuracy of Equation (27) as well.
Under the premises that the rainfall intensity remains unchanged and RI a 2.0 , the CN that
corresponds to Equation (27) can be presented as the following, to be consistent with that of
the SCS method:
254
25400

CN
R

That is,
2545
25400



CN (30)
Equation (30) not only provides a theoretical foundation for the CN value, but also discovers
that the key parameters of the antecedent conditions are only , , and  , regarding 
can be expressed by  and . This facilitates the use of the antecedent conditions to
classify the CN value, and transforms Equation (30) into the look-up tables of CN as used for
the SCS model.
Table 2 lists four models mentioned in this study for comparisons. It is clear that 
and CN are common variables required for deriving eP for each model in the table, and the
third model (Equation (27)) needs an additional variable . Since numerous influential
factors, such as water content, permeability coefficient, and rainfall intensity or duration, are
implicitly involved in equations in Table 2, too many combinations cause the model
comparison to become quite complicated. Moreover, CN values affect the accuracy of each
model. These four equations are therefore first transformed into dimensionless equations of f
(= /eP ) according to the relationship that aI , in order to remove the uncertainty
caused by CN values and unnecessary complication; these equations are then marked with
suffixes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, for distinguishing purposes (see figure 8).

6where soil moisture deficit 00 wwsd   ; ws and 0w are saturated water content and
initial water content, respectively. S is presented in a similar form by Collis-George (1977)[10]
when ascribing a physical basis to the Horton model. Equation (70) assumes that the thickness
of accumulated surface water may be negligible, and that soil homogeneity and initial water
content do not vary with soil depth. Now, Equation (70) and Table 3 can be used to calculate
the S value of different types of soil under different antecedent conditions. The results are
shown in Figure 5, which illustrates the tendency of tp and t5 of sand, silt loam, and clay to
vary with p/cKs at different initial water contents. The results reveal that when the water
content and rainfall intensity (not p/cKs) are the same, the tp value of sand is the greatest,
while that of clay is the smallest. In terms of the same level of rainfall intensity, the tp value of
same soil is shortened as 0w increases. These findings all correspond to the facts. Moreover,
by taking p=15mm/hr and 0w =0.3 for example, it is found that pt for sand, 3pt hr
for silt loam, and 1pt hr for clay after examining the figure. A rainfall intensity of
15mm/hr and an initial water content of approximately 0.3 (equal to a relative saturation of
67%) are common phenomena, not occasional events. Thus, if pt10 (which satisfies the limit
condition of 10/ ptt ) is set as the threshold time, the rainfall duration needs to exceed at
least , 30, and 10 hours, so that the SCS method can become effective for sand, silt loam,
and clay, respectively. In reality, however, it is not often that the rain lasts for more than 30
hours without pause. Thus, when the primary limit condition for 5/ scKp (i.e., 2.0 )
cannot be satisfied, the SCS method may be hardly applicable to sandy soil unless the
antecedent effective saturation of soil exceeds 67%.

9.2 Parameter Determination
1 in the modified Mishra-Singh model has been considered merely as a function of 

in which w, the upper limit of integral , is set as 0.95 to prevent  . When the values of
M and N reach infinity, the last two terms of Equation (72) are equal. Figure 7 (left) shows by
numerical integration that 708.0516.0 1  , and 1 quickly becomes stable as M (=N)
increases. This reasonably explains why Mishra and Singh used 0.5 to substitute for 1.
Similarly, let 

 . From Figure 7 (right), it can be found that after integration, 
rapidly increases to 6.40 from 1.05 before gradually decreasing to 3.70 and reaching a stable
state. Thus, the representative value of  is set as 3.70 in this study to close Equation (29).
Since  varies over a wide range, it can be predicted that it is hardly possible to maintain the
basic form of the SCS model and match most observation data simply by choosing another 

Figure 7: The Convergence Behavior of 1 and 
10
Equation (27) explains all the properties of the SCS method which, along with several
variants, thereby becomes its subclass. m=0.3 and n=1.5, as proposed by Jain et al., is a good
approximation for almost all the range of  if 1.0 , but needs to be corrected for other
ranges. Meanwhile, 1, as introduced in the modified Mishra-Singh model, can be simply
presented as the linear function of  through the theoretical validation in this study,
indicating a strong correspondence with Equation (27). The  value of 0.2 is high and better
be modified as /2.0 to correspond to the calibrated result of the Mishra-Singh variable
coefficient model. This study proves that the modified Mishra-Singh model is like a special
function. Its input value is extremely close to the output value when the input is between 0
and 0.9, leading to high correspondence between the model and the observed data. This is
very helpful for calibration of the involved parameters, 1 and 2 . However, the calibrated
range is wide, so the predictability of this model becomes limited, unless regularity is derived
from the calibrated results. The postulation of 2/12  , in the modified Mishra-Singh model,
is quite reasonable after theoretical validation in this study and may be regarded as a fixed
value. The 1 of the general model, on the other hand, is very sensitive to even slight
changes in 2 . This is consistent to Mishra-Singh’s calibration, and proves the feasibility of
using constant rainfall intensity to examine the SCS model. In addition to commenting on the
models, this study derives the theoretical formula of CN using Equation (27), so that the
calculation of CN values and classification of antecedent conditions can be based on a more
solid foundation.
Finally, the rise in water level following catchment urbanization is found to be strongly
related with  and G. Being a lump variable, G incorporates the rating curve coefficients,
river characteristics, and total rainfall. Numerical experiments display a non-linear
relationship between the rise and . It is also found that model accuracy has a greater
influence on the estimation of the rise during heavy rain, and the influence weakens during
light rain. Some unclear issues are clarified as well, including: (i) limits of the SCS model; (ii)
the possibility that Fa may not increase with rainfall intensity; (iii) the reason why 02  in
most cases in the Mishra-Singh general model; (iv) determination of the influential factors of
CN and antecedent conditions; (v) the reason why most of the actual CN values range
between 40 and 98; and (vi) the phenomenon that runoff estimation is extremely sensitive to
CN values. For future researches, a normal distribution, rather than a uniform one, will be
adopted to more closely represent the variation of actual rainfall intensity.
