一、前言
地理資訊系統發展二十餘來，已成功應用於眾多與空間現象有關的領域，但
參考於不同軟體格式的資料及日益增加的共享需求均顯示新一代的地理資訊系
統不可能再侷限於過去的單機運作型態，而必須考量在網際網路平台上發展一個
更為「開放」機制的可能性。「開放」意味一個具有高度「互操作性」的環境，
依 Schell（2000）之定義，互操作性可被視為「使用者或設備經由單一、無變化
的作業介面存取多種類異質資源之能力」，顯然意味一個服務與資料供應可以透
過開放格式或介面相互支援，並架構於網際網路的工作環境。開放式的環境不可
能任由各領域自行發展，而必然需要訴諸「標準」之手段，以約制發展的共同基
礎，從而達成無礙的溝通與內容的解讀（Brodeur 等人，2000）。國際標準組織
（International Organization for Standardization）之 TC 211 與 OGC（Open
Geospatial Consortium）在 1994 年成立後，分別推動了系列的地理資訊系統標準，
期待可建立共同的資料描述架構和系統溝通介面，透過標準化的概念，使資料可
在異質系統之間交換（Devogele 等人，1998），以達成地理資料之互操作性（Kreese
及 Fadaie，2004； Zhang 等人，2003）。在這些標準的規劃遠景中，未來之空間
資訊流通架構中將主要由「資料」與「網路服務」控制，使用者將透過網際網路
使用位於遠端之網路服務，獲得特定之資料或進行特定的操作，而總體目標當然
在於使用者不須面對不同資料格式之處理或甚至不須感覺操作是藉由遠端的服
務達成。
開放式環境中之資料流通當然不可能再架構於商業軟體格式，且地理資料之
包裝應可兼具可於網際網路環境運作及可描述不同資料之條件。XML格式包裝
空間資訊是近幾年發展的主流技術，例如日本之G-XML（Japan Database
Promotion Center，2004）及目前由ISO/TC211與OGC所共同推動，編號為ISO
19136之GML（Geography Markup Language）標準（OGC，2003），均是以XML
為基礎而延伸制定的地理圖形標記語言。基於GML開放之特性，可透過XML之
基礎提升資料共享之成效（鄧東波等人，2004）。除應用綱要的設計外，GML之
配套機制在近年也大有進展，例如伺服器端資料的儲存改為GML格式(Zhang 等
人，2003；Córcoles and González，2002)、發展GML查詢語言處理機制(Córcoles
and González，2001；Hong及Tsou，2004)、僅回傳符合查詢約制條件的GML資
料集(Zhang and Gruenwald，2001)等，都使GML更接近可直接應用之階段。另一
方面，網際網路服務也開始大量運用開放格式來改善地理資料之流通，例如WFS
（OGC，2002）和OpenLS（OGC，2005）之空間資訊服務所回傳的資料均透過
GML包裝，甚至如近年名聲大噪的Google Earth所推動的KML，也可視為一種開
放格式。
開放格式與服務介面固然在近幾年有快速的發展，但我們認為地理資訊應用
的成功關鍵在於資料內容的包裝瞭解及不同種類服務介面之整合應用，這些都不
2004）。除基本服務外，也陸續有由基本服務擴展之研究，例如Schwarz等人（2004）
發展架構於Simple Feature Specification所描述空間物件的坐標系統轉換架構，可
在明確定義之坐標系統間進行轉換。由使用者觀點來說，這些服務雖提供多元的
內容，但重點都在他們可以解讀使用者之需求，將位於遠端的異質性地理資源，
透過適當運作後，以使用者可以瞭解的格式傳遞給使用者，開放格式在
GML-aware的環境或許不再是極大的挑戰，但如何提升於使用者端的應用層面則
需另一番思維。
Kuhn（1993）由 metaphor 之概念提出地圖介面為使用者了解現實世界狀態
的圖形展示工具，此概念也廣為應用於目前的使用者介面中。近年數值製圖及地
理資訊系統軟體所帶來的便利已使製圖者憂心忡忡（Vitek 等人，1996），開放式
地理資訊系統架構更可能允許不同來源之地理資料「動態」地在地圖介面結合展
示，勢必構成更為嚴峻的挑戰。一個立即可行的策略是詮釋資料的引用及資料應
用知識的結合，詮釋資料可簡單定義為「描述資料的資料」（Bretherton 及 Singley，
1994），亦即資料建置者基於對實體資料之了解，另外建置一個用以描述該資料
的資料。近年空間資訊產業已有採用 ISO 19115（ISO，2003）之詮釋資料標準
為共同規範的共識，其編碼運作透過 XML 格式紀錄，架構中也擴展允許定義如
資料庫層級、檔案層級及物件層級的詮釋資料（Zabala 及 Maso，2005）。雖然目
前詮釋資料仍以提供於網際網路上的空間資訊查詢及取得為主要之應用（Luo 等
人，2003），但其角色事實上可廣泛包括資料發現、取得、儲存、轉換、表現、
處理及分析等不同場合（Mdeyckyj 等人，1996），若能以標準化的架構描述，並
納入於供應之資料中（檔案或圖徵）（陳松靖與洪榮宏，2003），將有可能進一步
達成後續之連結操作，過去如地理資料有效範圍判斷的處理程序（洪榮宏等人，
2002；Liao 及 Hong，2004）、資料完整性的判斷（洪榮宏與張明智，2004）等皆
為透過檔案或圖層詮釋資料概念而發展的機制，在未來網路服務以單一圖徵為基
礎的描述架構中，也可進一步探討如何以圖徵層級詮釋資料成功描述圖徵之不同
特性。
在近年空間資訊流通日益便利後，不同來源資訊整合應用之考量因素日益複
雜， Smits 及 Annoni（2003）認為包括如語意、理論、標準，甚至行政立法之
因素都可能影響整合結果。以圖徵之模擬而言，可透過語意對圖徵進行判斷與處
理是重要的策略，Uitermark 等人（1999）、Fonseca 等人（2002）、Yi 等人（2002）
基本上均利用領域知識本體（Domain Ontology）與應用知識本體（Appilcation
Ontology）之間的對應關係，達成在物件層級的語意近似（Semantic Similarity）
關係，以區隔或處理相同的空間物件。由於地理資料種類繁多，其發展必受到領
域知識範疇的限制，例如 Fonseca 等人（2000）即將討論範圍侷限於都市地理資
訊系統之知識本體因素，允許單一之物體可以多重之知識本體描述，從而達成跨
領域資料之表現與溝通。Guan 等人（2003）則進一步提出一個架構於 GML 格
（1） 辨識性
各類單一圖徵必須可被正確及唯一辨識，並可作為後續不同來源圖徵
結合之依據（具有相同辨識碼）。此類架構的發展必須考量辨識碼系
統的發展，因此單一圖徵必須具有可供辨識的「辨識值」及其對應之
辨識碼系統，並可與未來規劃之語意架構結合。
（2） 空間描述
具有空間特性之單一圖徵必定具有空間之描述，可為不同維度或甚至
更複雜的組合空間物件型別，且為建立各圖徵之正確位置對應關係，
每個空間描述都「必須」配合記錄其對應之坐標參考系統，以配合後
續的坐標系統轉換需求。
（3） 品質描述
單一圖徵可由不同之方式測製，因此具有不同的資料品質（例如位置
精度可能有相當之差異），但在使用者端的地圖介面中，卻可能被任
意疊合使用，因而造成錯誤之決策，此品質之描述因此為基本架構之
必要項目。
（4） 時間描述
每個圖徵都具有特定之時間描述因素，過去之地圖往往限定於單一時
間點的狀態，但在以圖徵為基礎的流通環境中，各圖徵之時間差異性
可能相當明顯，因此時間之描述也成為必要之項目。
（5） 供應資訊
上述之規劃項目雖可滿足基本時空描述之需求，但使用者仍可能對於
取得之圖徵有進一步的瞭解需求，因此基本描述架構必須可以具有圖
徵供應機關之描述。
基於「標準化」描述之需求，本研究引入 ISO/TC211 19100 系列標準中之對
應標準，以設計可高度結合流通環境之共同基本架構，引入之標準分別為可供發
展為空間辨識的 ISO19112 標準、可供空間位置及坐標系統描述的 ISO19107 及
ISO19111 標準、可供時間描述的 ISO19108 標準及可供品質及供應機關描述的
ISO19115 詮釋資料標準。設計架構最後透過 ISO19136 標準（Geography Markup
Language）促成開放格式資料之流通。上述之 ISO/TC211 標準均僅提供特定項目
的基礎，本年度之研究經由特性之分析而設計出各項目標準化之描述架構。標準
化的描述架構使每個圖徵都具有一個「共同」的描述部分，由於描述方式遵循特
定之標準，也代表使用者依「固定」的方式即可解讀圖徵的共同特性，對於發展
後續機制（例如使用者端之地圖介面）而言，將可達到簡化程序及配合機制可輕
易共享之成效。圖 1 顯示本研究所設計之共同基本架構與各標準之關係。共同基
本架構僅為針對「必要性」而考量之設計，在單一圖徵設計時，各應用單位當然
具有擴充而另行納入其他屬性之彈性，以構成完整之圖徵設計。圖 2 顯示共同基
本架構在未來流通系統之應用，各圖徵除具有共同部分外，可有依其需求設計之
發展具備辨識性之圖徵體系後，本研究透過可以辨識碼進行串連之特性，以
統計主題地圖為研究對象進行探討。遠端伺服器具備空間圖徵及識別碼之資料，
並透過 Geo-Link Service 提供遠端之連結。透過引入主題地圖判斷知識，本研究
成功發展網際網路之主題地圖製作機制，使用者端不具空間描述之主題屬性資
料，可藉由指定具備空間特性之識別碼（Geographic Identifier）及其參考系統，
透過服務之比對機制，與後端圖徵資料進行結合運作，並經由主題知識之協助，
以 WMS 提供使用者正確的統計主題地圖。本部分研究為基本描述架構中辨識性
之延伸研究，可佐證此描述架構不惟可應用於具備空間特性之資料，尚可擴充應
用於原本不具空間描述之資料，使未來流通環境內之各類資料均可有效串連，形
成良好的整合應用體系。
五、實作結果與討論
依前述之發展架構，由各單位所生產之各類資料均可透過設計應用綱要，並
以開放格式供應，每個單一圖徵均將包括共同之基本描述架構，以下進一步探討
本研擬架構於使用者端應用之成效，研究中建立了如圖 7 之測試環境，設計之原
則如下：
（1）用戶端之使用者不必安裝額外軟體，透過瀏覽器連結至網際網路，下載 GML
查詢整合介面之 Applet，透過視覺化地圖查詢介面，即可查詢與展示不同來
源的異質地理資料。
（2）包括提供坐標轉換服務的 WCTS 元件，資料搜尋者不須擔心查詢的異質地
理資料可能基於不同坐標系統的情形，地圖介面也可以正確地展示其空間位
置，此架構將基礎於共同的標準化坐標系統描述。
（3）GML 查詢整合介面透過目錄中記錄各伺服器端所提供地理資料的資訊，掌
握分散於網際網路世界的地理資料。
（4）用戶端透過地圖查詢介面搜尋興趣區域的地理資料，供應環境以圖徵為基
礎，僅回傳符合查詢條件的圖徵實體。搜尋而得的各資料均仍符合本文設計
的資料基本描述架構，因此 GML 查詢整合介面可以依照描述架構的特性，
設計地圖介面知識輔助機制，協助用戶端進行資料篩選與解讀。
各元件之發展討論如下：
（1）GML 查詢整合介面伺服器端
本研究選用昇陽（Sun）所開發能跨越作業平台的 Java 程式語言，撰寫擁有
視覺化介面的 Applet 嵌入於網頁之中。Java 是目前最普及的網際網路程式語言，
允許將可執行的 Applet 自 Web Server 傳遞至用戶端瀏覽器，並直接在用戶端機
器上執行，從而省略整套傳統軟體的安裝過程。這樣的設計也允許在用戶端進行
圖徵層級詮釋資料與地理識別碼進行查詢，其中詮釋資料部分之查詢結果以頁籤
之方式區隔，由於各圖徵之描述架構相同，因此無論選擇哪個圖徵，本展示介面
將一體適用。配合圖徵的模擬基礎，本年度研究另行規劃以地理識別碼為串聯不
同來源地理資料之架構，成功開發網際網路統計地圖之展現機制，使原本不具空
間描述之屬性資料可關連位於遠端具備空間描述之圖徵資料，再進一步與網路服
務架構結合，以 WMS 方式供應，使用者端僅需瀏覽器即可執行展示之工作。圖
11 顯示所設計之使用者端溝通介面，圖 12 顯示透過製圖知識運作後，自動系統
判斷使用者上傳資料可完成之地圖，圖 13 則顯示完成之地圖，其後端涉及藉由
基本描述架構之地理識別碼的串連運作。
由於各圖徵已包括基本之描述內容，本研究進一步於展示介面引入地圖知識
（Cartographic Knowledge）之概念，透過主題地圖之技巧進行各類地理資料之展
現。例如可以各類地理資料之坐標系統為展示條件，依各資料原始之坐標系統配
合以同類符號展示（圖 14），如此使用者對於展示過程中已經過處理之地理資料
便可有較為清楚之認識。若加入精度之展示考量，則對於相對位置的判斷將可更
為精準與正確。透過標準化之描述，使用者端將可正確抽取各地理資料之原始坐
標系統，並配合進行展示。設計架構目前已內建坐標系統、時間及精度等級等不
同的處理機制，可於展示模組以主題地圖方式顯示各類圖徵之不同特性的差異。
六、結論
電腦資訊科技的蓬勃發展造就了今日網際網路的發達，網路服務無遠弗屆的
力量也促成更為便利的地理資訊共享環境。目前使用者雖可透過網路及搜尋引
擎，快速查詢甚至取得分散在網路各處的地理資訊，但在未考量地理資料之互操
作性下，在使用者端整合及應用不同來源之異質性地理資料仍是相當之挑戰。如
何能讓異質地理資料即使處於不同的環境或系統，仍然可以正確地被判讀與使
用，達成地理資料之互操作性即是本研究主要探討的課題。本研究提出必須在各
類圖徵資料之建立與模擬時引入需共同遵循之基本描述架構，使必要之基本描述
可被明確辨認與應用，以有利於後續網際網路以空間資訊服務為基礎的相關架構
發展。本研究基於辨識、空間、時間、品質及供應等五項基本考量，提出圖徵之
基本描述架構，並透過符合國際地理資訊系統標準之架構設計，使來自於不同來
源之地理資料可以開放格式於使用者端進行整合應用。基於提升運作效率及減低
重複，本研究進一步發展以圖徵集合為基礎的運作模式，並分析如何建立圖徵與
其隸屬集合之間詮釋資料的對應處理關係。針對未來之圖徵流通環境，本年度研
究特別發展引入地圖知識之展示環境，並分別成功探討如何透過基本描述架構達
成坐標系統之轉換及與地圖介面展示知識的結合，充分映證在基本架構之協助
下，未來之地理資訊系統流通及應用將可在更為透明的環境中順利達成。本研究
之成果將可提供國內各應用單位未來設計應用綱要之基礎，若能納入於國家級之
地理資料標準設計中，將可進一步提升其應用成效。

interface whenever necessary. With more and more commercial GIS software companies and
communities supporting OpenGIS standards, the GIS technology is now under a tremendous revolution
and it is surely interesting to investigate how this would impact the issue of thematic maps. We
believe a web-based thematic map service should not be restricted to only display ready-made maps, it
should be able to allow domain users to submit their own data, sometimes even without graphic
description, and create thematic maps by built-in cartographic knowledge and services that comply
with the OpenGIS standards. Furthermore, these services may serve different purposes and located in
different places in the distributed OpenGIS environment. The immediate challenge is we longer have
data with correct corresponding relationship between spatial and aspatial descriptions beforehand, and
must create this mapping dynamically. Secondly, since all the required data may come from different
servers, the thematic map service must have built-in knowledge to justify the received data content and
make appropriate mapping decisions. This paper discusses our preliminary attempt to develop a
web-based thematic map service that complies with various OpenGIS standards and the research result
will also serve as the foundation of the service-oriented infrastructure for the years to come.
2. System Architecture
A thematic map depicts the spatial distribution of the selected theme, its successful creation therefore
relates to at least three steps: (1) prepare data with correct spatial-aspatial corresponding relationship,
(2) apply cartographic knowledge to determine mapping process, and (3) execute the mapping process.
Current GIS software usually requires users to prepare data by themselves and provides wizard
interface to guide users’ mapping actions. To design a web-based thematic map service based on the
OpenGIS technology, four major requirements are first identified:
1) Thematic data is provided by domain users
2) Thematic map service possesses built-in knowledge to judge data contents and perform
necessary mapping actions
3) Data and services can be stored and processed separately in different servers
4) The communicating interface among different services must comply with OpenGIS standards
Fig. 1 shows the three-tier system architecture of the thematic map service we proposed. The
three tiers respectively relate to (1) client that allow users to issue request and receive response, (2)
thematic map servers that make cartographic decision and (3) basic services that provide necessary
cartographic operations. These three tiers are connected in internet web-based environment, with the
thematic map servers acting as the bridge between clients and basic services.

GDAS Servers
GLS Servers
Thematic Map Servers
Internet Internet
WMS Servers
Fig 1. 3-Tier system architecture of the thematic map service
1) Client tier
To reduce software/hardware technical requirement, client should be able to interact with the
thematic map servers with only standard browsers. This limits the request and response should follow
HTTP protocol and the returned maps wil be in image formats, such that it can be displayed in clients’ 
browsers without further processing. Clients will be prompted a homepage to upload their thematic
data and provide necessary descriptions about the uploaded data. Ideally the uploaded data should
also comply with certain standards, but it is surely an overwhelming loading to clients. We instead
choose Microsoft Excel as the designated format for the uploaded thematic data, because it is widely
used in PC platform and has the capability to import various data formats like HTML table, CSV, TXT.
MDB and DBF. This can of course be expanded in the future if necessary.
2) Thematic Map Server tier
A GDAS server complying with OGC GDAS standard can store attribute data with geographic
identifiers (GID), and allow other clients or servers to request data that meet their demands.
Geographic identifiers usually refer to a unique code that can be used to identify a feature with spatial
extent, e.g., name of the political regions, street address of buildings, zip code, etc. Whenever data is
collected in accordance with the spatial extent of GID (which is usually the case of thematic map data),
it is advisory to include GID as one of the attribute and thus introduce an implicit spatial description to
the attribute data. A GID framework therefore refers to a set of unique and systematic coding of GID,
for example, there are 6 political districts in the Tainan city now, so the framework will consist of 6
different GID (East, South, Central-West, North, An-Nan and An-Ping) and can be named as “Tainan 
city political district framework.”  Since GID wil be used as the reference for joining atribute and 
spatial data, GID framework is better created and maintained by authorized organizations. Whenever
there is any change to a GID framework, a new version of GID framework should be created and the
old version must still be saved for possible future use. For example, there were 7 political districts the
Tainan city in the past, but the Central district and West district were merged to a new Central-West
district beginning with the year of 2004. If the data is about the years before 2003, the 7-district
version of GID framework should be chosen.
Following the GDAS standard, attribute data, together with its metadata, will be transformed and
stored in XML format so that later internet communications between servers (e.g, data transfer) can be
based on the XML technology. Fig. 3 shows an example of the recording data in the GDAS servers
Fig. 3 Thematic data stored in GDAS Servers
2. GLS Server
A GLS server complying with the OGC GLS standard can build a link between the attribute data
acquired from GDAS servers and its corresponding digital map data with common GID (similar to a
“join” operation in relational database). A GLS server should have a digital map database to provide
different GID framework and a mechanism to perform linkage operations. During the creation of
thematic maps, it is a mandatory requirement that the data from GDAS server and GLS server must
refer to the same GID framework, otherwise the mapping should not be executed any further.
However, since these two types of services are created and maintained separately, it is certainly
possible that no appropriate digital maps are available for creating correct thematic maps.
To improve the thematic map content, the proposed service includes a “reference map” design, 
such that clients can overlay roads or political districts to help map reading. From a cartographic
perspective, the reference map data and GLS digital map should better refer to the same period of time
and the same level of positional accuracy. Since this is not included in the specification of GLS
standards, this is done primarily in thematic map servers with built-in cartographic knowledge.
3. WMS servers
temporal logic [12], it is definitely preferred that  a “contain” relationship exists between these two 
time records, meaning the digital map files can be safely applied to uploaded data. The Tainan city
district adjustment case is a typical example of this issue. If a client submits a statistic data ranging
from the year of 2000 to 2005, there is practically no single digital map file that can fulfill this mapping
request because a new version is created in the year of 2004. No matter the time is modeled as a point
or an interval, it is always possible that no overlap existing between the two recorded time. Though it
does not necessarily mean the created thematic maps are wrong, certain risk is inevitable.
3. GID
Even if the title and temporal constraints are qualified, the linking relationship between the two
types of data still requires one-to-one comparison. For example, a client may make a mistake about
the reference time of the uploaded data （recorded as 2005 while it should be 2001）, the six-district
version is found and returned. The GID comparison will immediately indicate that some of the data
records do not have correct linkage and the completeness assumption is violated (in this case, statistics
of the central and west district do not have correct corresponding relationships). We must, however,
note that this violation does not always indicate mistakes. When a client has only the statistic data
about three political districts, the linkage relationship is surely partial. A warning message will still
be issued, but the thematic maps should still be created accordingly.

2) Mapping process
A typical creation procedure of thematic maps involves the interactions among all of the servers
discussed in section 2. The following is a step-by-step description starting from users’ map request 
till the completion of JPEG format thematic maps sent back to users (illustrated in Fig. 5):
Step 1: Users send mapping request and upload Excel format file to Thematic Map Servers via internet
Step 2: Thematic Map Server judges if maps can be correctly created, transform Excel file to XML
format according to GDAS standards and send XML file to GDAS servers.
Step 3: Thematic Map Server sends GeoLink request to GLS servers via HTTP protocol
Step 4: GLS server sends getData request to GDAS servers via HTTP protocol to access thematic data
(created in step 2)
Step 5: GDAS servers respond getData request and send back the XML format thematic data
Step 6: GLS servers link thematic data and corresponding spatial data via common GID, and register a
new layer in the WMS servers
Step 7: WMS servers send the URL of the newly created map layer back to the GLS servers
Step 8: GLS servers respond a XML file to the Thematic Servers to indicate the Geolink process is

Fig. 7 shows the homepage the thematic map servers prompt to clients. Clients have to select the
corresponding GID framework of the uploaded file (Step 1), fill in metadata and selected attributes
(Step 2) and specify the pathname of the uploaded file (Step 3). The GID framework is designed as a
“selected” pul down menu, meaning if no appropriate framework is available, then the thematic map
service cannot satisfy clients’ mapping request.  In this example, al three atributes in Table 1 are 
selected and clients have to provide necessary metadata for each attribute. After clients submit their
data, the thematic map servers analyze uploaded data and response analyzed results (Fig. 8). Clients
are prompted with illustrations to select preferred types of thematic maps and reference map data
(roads and political districts).

When more than one attribute is chosen, bar chart and pie chart thematic maps can be used to
depict the difference among different categories or period of time（Fig. 9）. Unfortunately current
WMS server does not provide such capability to draw bar or chart symbol. The current version of the
thematic map service superimposes designed symbols to the output maps according to the specific
location of GID, but does not have sufficient cartographic knowledge to automatically adjust their sizes
and labeling. This may need additional works in the future.
5. Conclusions
The OpenGIS technology opens a new dimension for the creation of thematic maps. In the past, the
closed data format and insufficient professional skill impede many non-spatial domain users to create
thematic maps fulfilling their needs. While most of the current WebGISs still only allow users to
display and create thematic maps based on data already stored in their databases, we proposed a
web-based thematic map service based on a number of OGC standards like GDAS, GLS, and WMS,
which will allow naïve users to submit their thematic data via internet and receive thematic maps based
on the data they sent from the service. The proposed service architecture works on the basis of
standardized interface among different servers and allow easier data integration and interoperability.
With built-in cartographic knowledge, the major breakthrough of this research is even the users have
only little professional knowledge and thematic data without explicit spatial description, the thematic
map can still be created accordingly. Furthermore, the separated nature of aspatial and spatial data
(corresponds to GDAS and GLS servers, respectively) in the system architecture makes it possible for
these two types of data to be managed separately in the National Spatial Data Infrastructure
environment. Domains without spatial knowledge can maintain their own GDAS servers and take
advantage of the proposed service to create their own thematic maps. In the mean time, the thematic
map service and a variety of GLS servers can be maintained by the NSDI authority organizations, who
often has superior ability to handle spatial data. Under this circumstances, naïve users no longer have
to deal with unfamiliar data format and worry about the barrier of cartographic and information
knowledge.

evolution of internet technology brought tremendous impacts on the use and distribution of
geographic data, particularly with the emergence of internet-based search engine. By
creating mechanisms like catalogue, warehouse or even portal, users nowadays can easily find
a data file created by an organization they have no prior knowledge, possibly located
thousand of miles away. The past tedious and unorganized data search and acquisition
procedure is now replaced by a simple search interface that only requires some mouse clicks
and keyboard strokes. The innovated WebGIS technology further opens a new
dimensionality to enable spatial query and instant distribution of geographic data via internet.
With more and more organizations publishing their data in internet, it is now possible to
quickly assemble and overlay geographic data from different resources at client environment
and generate meaningful outcomes and decisions.
Though the WebGIS technology certainly improves how geographic data is transferred from
data providers to possible users, the variety of commercial WebGIS data formats, similar to
what happened to Desktop GIS, remains to be an obstacle. The ISO/TC211 and the OGC
(Open Geospatial Consortium) each proposed a series of GIS standards, intending to setup a
common framework toward different aspects of geographic information technology. By
following such neutral standards, better interoperability (Sondheim et al., 1999) among
geographic database in heterogeneous environment can certainly be expected.
Interoperability can be defined as
 the ability to find information and processing tools, when they are needed, no matter
where they are physically located, and
 the ability to understand and employ the discovered information and tools, no matter
what platform supports them, whether local or remote (Danko,2003).
It is clear that the purpose of the ISO GIS standards is not restricted to data transfer only.
Every standard in the 19100 family focuses on a special aspect of GIS related issues and
different standards can be combined together whenever needed. For example, the ISO
19107 standard specifies the spatial aspects of geographic features at conceptual level, the
ISO 19136 (formerly the OGC GML standard) standard (OGC, 2004; Lake,) deals with its
encoding, and the Web Feature Service (WFS) standard (OGC, 2005) deals with how
GML-based data can be transferred via web interface. The three standards enable the
modelling and application of spatial phenomena from conceptual level to direct use level (Lee
et al.,2003; Zhang et al., 2003). On the other hand, the ISO 19115 standard (2003b)
proposed a common metadata framework, the ISO 19115-2 standard further expands the
scope of metadata to imagery and grid data, and finally the ISO 19139 standard specifies the
encoding detail of metadata elements. These standards work seamlessly to ensure all related
issues, such as data description, data transfer, system interface and web service, can all refer
to a coherent foundation and the response result is transparent to the end users all the time.
It is then possible to create additional application service based on standardized format of
geographic data, as OpenLS claims.
Nonetheless, the introduction of international GIS standards does not necessarily imply the
data interoperability in heterogeneous environment would be automatically achieved, as it
still depends on how data providers describe their data and how end users interpret the data.
Specifically speaking, the international GIS standards serve as a set of tools allowing various
domains to “interact” with each other in a standardized way.  It is up to the domain data 
providers to determine how to describe their data (e.g., application schema of a certain type of
data) and it is important for users who receive the data to be able to correctly interpret the
data.  The standards only serve as an “intermediary” to successfuly transfer geographic data 
(possibly in different format originally and stored in heterogeneous and distributed
environment) in an open and transparent way.
Instead of the traditional “whole file download” approach, the geographic data distribution in

The production of traditional paper maps must adhere to specific mapping specifications
designed with cartographic knowledge. The specifications not only ensure the correct
presentation of spatial phenomena, but also serve as the communication foundations between
cartographers and map users. The design of maps is a complicated task that at least involves
the determination of measurement level, feature dimensionality, as well as the symbol design
(Robinson et al., 1996). If the production of a map must go through such complicated
procedures to ensure its correctness and quality, it is impractical to believe we can have a
comprehensive illustration of spatial phenomena by simply overlaying thematic data layers
acquired from different resources. Unfortunately it is exactly the way GIS map interface is
being used today. With the given map interface, we literally add or delete thematic map
layers to adjust its content, regardless of their updated frequency, accuracy and degree of
details. No matter what the outcome may be, the content appeared in map window is
generaly treated as a “map.”  When adding a thematic map layer to the map window, earlier 
versions of GIS software may check if the two coordinate systems are the same to determine
if the map layer can be properly displayed.  Sometimes only “map unit” (e.g., meters) is 
checked and GIS software will make most of the mapping decisions (e.g. the style of symbol).
While we are so concerned about how a quality paper map should be produced, it is ironic
that we are so ignorant about the contents of map interface and in the mean time still treat it as
a map.
With the diverse types of maps available nowadays, it is impossible to list all constraints a
map must adhere to in this paper, but some common assumptions or consideration can still be
concluded:
 A map has a specific spatial coverage
 The geographic features in a map typically refer to the same coordinate system
 The corresponding time for geographic features in a map should better be referred to a
specific time instance or at least be well controlled.
 Different types of geographic features is better referred to the same level or within a
reasonable range of positional accuracy
 For all selected themes, their related geographic features within the map spatial coverage
must be completely found to ensure its completeness
These constraints respectively relate to the issues of spatial coverage, coordinate reference
system, time, accuracy and completeness. They represent the common and minimum
requirements for a map interface to be treated like a map from a cartographic perspective. If
violated, the content of map interface may hide the risk of wrong data use and any possible
conflicts should be identified and prompted to users.   Take “time” as an example, it is 
natural for users to assume that the map content represents the spatial phenomena at a certain
time instance, .e.g., all features simultaneously exist in reality at that moment. Figure 2
illustrates two types of features, roads (line features) and building (solid black surface
features), in a region. Ideally these two types of features should refer to the same time
instance, such that we can conclude the real situation look like figure 2 at the given time
instance. It does not really make sense to superimpose building features of 3 years ago onto
current road features (though technology feasible) as there is no way for us to assess possible
incompatible situations and draw a convincing conclusion. Suppose the two grey rectangles
represent the building status 3 years ago from another data, the one intersecting with road
features is surely questionable and need further check, but it is even more difficult to judge
another one, as it may still exist and represents a true situation or it may be no longer there.
No matter to treat this illustration as a map of current status or 3 years ago, the risk is
inevitable. Nevertheless, this risk cannot be compared with the risk if we never understand
doing so, we are able to simplify the data format map interface has to handle and reduce the
complexity for parsing and processing data because they will all follow the same set of open
standards. The advantage of this approach is the map content is based on the combination of
individual geographic feature independent of commercial software format. To meet such
demands, a typical geographic feature will at least consists of three major components:
 Spatial description: appropriate spatial data type and associated coordinate information
 Attributes: Information designed by data providers to describe a particular theme of
reality
 Metadata: data that is used to describe the geographic data
The design of geographic features starts with the conceptual modelling of reality. With tools
like UML, we can design the required elements for a certain type of geographic feature and
analyze its linked relationship to other feature types.  The designed result is an “application 
schema” (Galdos Systems Inc., 2003) for the geographic features, which can then be 
transformed to an “encoding” format that carry the actualdata. Since our major argument is
every geographic feature must carry descriptive information, the best way is to include such
descriptive information in the application schema of any type of geographic feature. This
suggests that the schema design of geographic feature wil start with a “common framework” 
that already includes a number of elements necessary to aid map interface interpretation
(Figure 4). Data providers can expand the framework to include more elements that meet
their application needs, but since the descriptive information is already embedded and
encoded in an open and standardized format with the common framework, the parsing and
interpretation at map interface becomes much easier.

To fulfil the map interface demands discussed in section 2, the common framework of
geographic feature must include the following components:
(1) Coordinate system
To graphically illustrate the correct relative location relationship among a set of
geographic features, a common coordinate reference system (CRS) is necessary.
Nonetheless, it is commonplace for a nation to have a set of different coordinate systems
and we frequently have to deal with geographic features referenced to different

Judgment
The design of identifier system helps to uniquely identify things that are actually the
same. For example, students can present their student ID to identify themselves in any
systems in school. If two features have the same identifier, we can reasonably believe
they actually refer to the same feature, only that they are created by different
organizations with different application needs. Unlike the above three categories, there
is generally no standardized identifier system and it is up to the domain experts to create
their own identifier system (maybe only applicable in the corresponding domains). The
ISO19112 standard (spatial referencing by geographic identifier) offers spatial
descriptions without using coordinate values. Since geographic identifier is widely
used in human daily lives, to include it in the application schema design certainly brings
positive impact in the interoperability of geographic data. For example, when dealing
with two geographic features respectively represent the population and education status
of a city, if both of them include the unique ID of the city in their application schema, the
interoperability will become much easier.
We can therefore conclude that ISO19136 (GML) and ISO 19115 (Metadata) provide
sufficient resource to implement the common framework for individual geographic feature we
proposed. If every geographic feature has correct self-descriptive information, then we can
have a better working environment, even if its contents are dynamically generated. How to
process these geographic features based on the common framework will depend on the task at
hands. Figure 5 illustrates the coordinate transformation flow with the proposed CRS
description. The coordinate system for the initial request is TWD67TM2. The data of the
three different databases is in three different coordinate systems: WGS84, TWD97TM2 and
TWD67TM2. When querying, the initial request has to be transformed to the respective
coordinate system of the queried database. In order to correctly display in the map interface,
the qualified features, regardless of their original coordinate systems, must be transformed to
be referred to TWD67TM2. Since the descriptive information is encoded in open format,
the whole process can be executed automatically and clients do not need to worry about how
it is completed.
Figure 5 Spatial query to data referenced to different coordinate systems.
The common framework ensures the recording of necessary self-descriptive information on
the basis of individual geographic feature. However, when dealing with a set of geographic
features sharing the same contents of metadata elements, this inevitably causes unpleasant
duplicates. The possible large volume of GML file is already a topic drawing much
attention these days, the burden of self-descriptive information may bring even more pressure
in the data transfer stage. One way to resolve this issue is to treat this set of geographic
features as a “FeatureColection” and assign the metadata to the level of feature collection.
The same content is therefore only recorded once and the data volume can be reduced to a
certain degree. To do so, a mechanism to extract required metadata information and assign it
to corresponding features must be developed.

Figure 7 shows parts of the GML data (the geographic feature of Tainan) from the statistical
data in Taiwan. While selecting the feature (surface) of the Tainan city, its associated
attribute information is displayed in the message window. Note the geographic identifier of
the Tainan city is 10021. Since the geographic identifier of city has been included in the
application schema design for both statistical data and population density data, the developed
map interface “automaticaly” search for any geographic features who share the same 
geographic identifier. Therefore the geographic feature about the population density of the
Tainan city is found as well, even if it is a point feature and users actually do not click on it
(Figure 8). This fully demonstrates the potential to be able to thoroughly control the
different representations of a specific feature in reality.

The latitude and longitude data will have to be transformed into plane coordinates so that it
can be displayed with other data. When all types of data are displayed together in the map
interface, it is hard to distinguish the original coordinate systems of the test data (Figure 9).
With the common framework, the original coordinate systems are recorded and we can
therefore apply a symbolization design to emphasize the nominal difference based on the CRS
of geographic features. Users can therefore easily identify geographic features that have
been transformed during the data retrieval process (such transformation process is generally
hidden from the users). Though the transformed coordinates does not necessarily have poor
position accuracy, it is nonetheless good for uses to have a mechanism to identify these
transformed features. A similar approach can be used to emphasize the ordinal or ratio
difference regarding scale, time and positional accuracy. For example, geographic features
whose temporal description closer to the current time is given a darker tone while those with
