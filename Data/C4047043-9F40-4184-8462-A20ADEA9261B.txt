robust performance as well as reduce the hydrogen 
consumption of this system, Sheng et al. [14] used the 
cascade PID control to guarantee the solid temperature 
of molten carbonate fuel cell  (MCFC) system under a 
prescribed temperature, and Zhang et al. [15] used a 
nonlinear model predictive controller to control of the 
output power, fuel utilization and temperature of the 
solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system. In those ap-
proaches, the model equations for MCFC or SOFC 
system were reduced into the linear model or stead-
state model [16, 17]. Coincidentally, they indicated 
that the temperature regulation problem is another crit-
ical issue for the study of efficiency of fuel cell sys-
tems. 
    In this article, the dynamic modeling and simulation 
of a simplistic hybrid energy system is constructed in 
the Matlab-Simulink™ environment. Whereas the high 
current demand may challenge the response capability 
of hybrid power generation and degrade the perfor-
mance of fuel cell stack, a multi-loop feedback control 
scheme for a PEMFC system is utilized. In our study, 
the amount of hydrogen is assumed to be regularly 
produced from electrolyzer. Under the restriction at 
windy district at specified time period, the wind tur-
bine is assumed to produce an abundant power and 
provide the regularly hydrogen inlet flow. Assumed 
that direct measurement of partial pressure of oxygen 
is avoided, and the manipulation of hydrogen flow is 
reduced according to the inlet hydrogen flow through 
throttle and re-circulating designs. Regarding our ap-
proach, state estimations are not required, both con-
trolled output variables are specified independently, 
and the nonlinear predictive control design subject to 
input/output constraints is efficiently achieved. By the 
closed-loop simulation results, the manipulation of 
both air (oxygen) and water flowrates are verified to 
accurately dominate the operation and performance of 
the PEM fuel cell system. 
 
4. System description 
    The isolated power generation system is composed 
of four major units including an AIR 403 wind turbine, 
a 5kW PEM fuel cell stack, an electrolyzer, and con-
troller devices. Regarding the hybrid energy comple-
mentary circulation, the wind turbine must serve as the 
transient power supply and meanwhile the excess wind 
power can drive the electrolyzer to produce the pure 
hydrogen regularly. 
4.1 PEM fuel cell stack with heat exchanger sys-
tem 
    According to Fig. 1 with the empirical-type fuel cell 
stack model by [18, 19], the pure hydrogen is fed to the 
anode and its excess gas can be re-circulated, the air 
used as the oxidant is kept flowing through the stack, 
the system is internally humidified by a circulating 
water system, and the temperature of water flowrate at 
the inlet is changed by the external heat exchanger de-
vice. The output voltage of a single fuel cell ( fcV ) is 
fromulated by  
         fc act ohmV E V V= − +  (1) 
where the thermodynamic potential (E) and the oh-
mic overvoltage ( ohmV ) are written as

The excess hydrogen is recirculated to the anode 
and the throttle is assisted to regulate the inlet flowrate 
of hydrogen, thereby the hydrogen molar outlet flo-
erating temperature. In the meantime, Fig. 3(c) depicts 
that the very fast response of oxygen excess ratio will 
drop at the low level. Obviously, the large step change 
of current load may damage the membrane and destroy 
the fuel cell system due to the overhigh temperature 
( o100 CT > ) and oxygen starvation (
2
<2Oλ ). How-
ever, Fig. 4 shows that the appropriately high tempera-
ture with respect to specified current demand could 
increase the power density as well as enhance the cell 
performance. Thereby, the stack temperature regulation 
against oxygen starvation must depend on an efficient 
feedback control scheme. 
5.1 Selection of manipulated and controlled variables 
Under the throttle and re-circulating designs for inlet 
hydrogen flow, the hydrogen inlet flowrate is assumed 
to be constant. Both stack temperature and oxygen 
excess ratio are treated as the controlled variables of 
the PEMFC system, and the water flowrate ( cwm& ) and 
oxygen (air) flowrate (
2,O in
m& ) are selected as manipu-
lated variables. Moreover, the loop interactions are 
expected to be reduced by choosing alternative con-
trolled and manipulated variables. Figs 5(a) and 5(b) 
show that the stack temperature is only influenced by 
step changes of water flowrate, but Figs 5(c) and 5(d) 
depict that the oxygen excess ratio is individually in-
fluenced by step changes of oxygen (air) flowrate. Ap-
parently, the PEMFC stack is open-loop stable, and the 
system interaction can be extremely decoupled while 
the controller pairing is cwm& -T and 2 ,O inm& - 2Oλ . 
5.2 Multi-loop nonlinear predictive control 
Under the selected manipulated and controlled va-
riables, the modeling dynamics for the PEMFC control 
system by Eqs (1)-(17) is denoted by the discrete-time 
representation.

temperature. Thereby the steady-state mode of the par-
tial pressure of oxygen at the cathode is written as

羅世界各地學者與業界專家一起參與，加上包羅萬象參展單位展出各類
節能載具將大大提升此類活動知名度，尤其世界各國積極推動節能減碳
工作之時，更顯該活動重要性。由於主辦單位在會議內容上十分用心，
特別安排主講場次是大家十分關心未來前瞻性研究議題，及盡可能安排
國際知名學者與會發表演說提供寶貴經驗與見解。甚至安排參訪活動大

化工程序控制等議題，但是從事控制相關研究人士與議題去是十分少
見。整體而言與會人士以達 1500 人之多與高達 20 個發表會場同時舉
