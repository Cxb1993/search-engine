Numerous pavement performance models that have been developed over the years
include regression models (e.g., AASHO, 1962; George et al., 1989; Madanant and Ibrahim,
1995; Yu et al., 2007), Markovian models (Butt et al., 1987; Yang et al., 2005), and neural
network methods (Alsugair and Al-Qudrah, 1998; Terzi, 2005). Extensive comparisons of
existing methodologies can be found in (Gendreau and Soriano, 1988; Chu and
Durango-Cohen, 2008). Pavement conditions are inherently imprecise because they are
collected from the inspector’s subjective judgments using linguistic terms (e.g., poor or
mediocre) or rules-of-thumbs. Thus fuzzy set based approaches have been applied to
overcome this problem (Elton and Jung, 1988; Shoukry et. al., 1997; Pan, 2007). Tanaka et
al. (1982) proposed the first fuzzy regression model for crisp input and fuzzy output data.
Following their work, various developments of fuzzy regression techniques and
applications have been implemented (Sakawa and Yano, 1992; D’Urso, 2003; Kao and
Chyu, 2004). Fuzzy regression model is regarded as an effective technique used to predict
fuzzy data or variables. However, most of the existing fuzzy regression methods require a
great deal of computations because of complicated fuzzy arithmetic.
Since the PSI values are assigned from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), the PSI is

2,…n, and n is the sample size; Yi is the fuzzy center; ei,,L and ei,,R is the left fuzzy width
and the fuzzy width of iY at  membership level, respectively. LY ,~ and RY ,~ are the
left bound and right bound of observed iY
~ at  level; whereas LY ,ˆ and RY ,ˆ are the
left bound and right bound of the estimated iˆY at  value. The use of  value aims to
sufficiently reflect the inspector’s degree of confidence in his or her judgment and to
represent different degree of uncertainty or fuzziness associated with the prediction
environment. With k crisp independent variables and one fuzzy dependent variable, the
estimated iˆY at a particular  value is given by

630 observations collected in 2008 from the Shengli road and Cianfong road located in
Tainan city, Taiwan, were applied. Table 1 shows the results. The pavement rating as
defined in Fig. 1 is regarded as a fuzzy response variable (Y); whereas the corresponding
roughness (X1), transverse cracking (X2), longitudinal cracking (X3), pothole (X4), and
rutting (X5) are considered as explanatory variables. The roughness of each pavement
section is measured by its standard deviation (S.D.) deriving from the slope variance. It can
be found in Table 1 that the observations are a mixture of fuzzy data and crisp data.

between the influencing factors and pavement condition can be examined. For instance, the
slope of X1 is － 4.715)4.722,(4.728, , indicating that regardless of other variables, an
estimated decrease of 4.722 in the PSI of the examined pavement section ( Yˆ ), decrease of
4.728 in the lower bound (left interval) and increase of 4.715 in the upper bound (right
interval) occurs for each additional standard deviation of roughness (X1). The above results
suggest that standard deviation of roughness and rut depths are the two most important
factors for reducing pavement performance; whereas longitudinal cracking is least
significant in this case study. Such information is useful for the maintenance unit to identify
which variables should receive more attention to improve pavement conditions. By the use
of Eq. (6), the fuzzy coefficient of determination yields 0.726 indicating that 72.6% of the
total variation in Y can be explained by the regression line relating to the inputs.
By the use of the foregoing procedure, the estimated regression equations based on
particular values can be obtained and can be graphically displayed. For example, Fig. 2

4. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents a matrix-driven multivariate fuzzy linear regression model which is
capable of fitting a regression equation to fuzzy data represented by asymmetric fuzzy set,
symmetric triangular fuzzy set, numerical data, or their combination. Moreover, this model
is more intuitive and straightforward than other related fuzzy regression approaches.
Applying this model, the pavement administration enables to establish fitted regression
equations, identify noteworthy variables affecting pavement performance, and to forecast
future conditions. Future pavement PSI value estimated by the model is useful for
determining the most cost-effective rehabilitation action and can be used as a signal to warn
the pavement maintenance units under the situation when the prediction outcome is
abnormally worse or close to the limit of allowance. The consequence of the case study
