ABSTRACT 
In this proposal, we expect to develop a novel 
image segmentation technique that combines the 
modified watershed algorithm and clustering algo-
rithm to minimize undesirable over-segmentation. 
Watershed segmentation invariably produces 
over-segmentation due to noise or local irregulari-
ties in the source images. 
In the novel image segmentation technique, 
first employ a neighborhood region merging 
method based on employing the Markov Random 
Field (MRF) model on the Region Adjacency 
Graph (RAG) to refine the quality of the watershed 
over-segmentation, then the relation of inter-region 
similarities is considered image mapping in the 
spatial domain (watershed), and feature spaces 
(clustering) in order to determine the region merg-
ing. To obtain the spatial domain and feature 
spaces representation of the image, we use the spa-
tial graph representation that was derived from the 
modified watershed partitioning and feature spaces 
representation that was acquired from the Fuzzy 
clustering technique. The purpose in the proposal is 
to reduce image over-segmentation, that is, to get 
the best segmented results. 
It expectable from our proposal that combining 
watershed algorithm and Fuzzy clustering technique 
will show more promising segmentation results in com-
parison with the conventional watershed segmentation 
method and fuzzy clustering algorithm. These tech-
niques also are to be integrated for life and clinical 
medical image segmentation. Therefore, the research 
will be beneficial for both academics and clinics.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The primary clinical goal of quantitatively moni-
toring disease progression in individual patients requires 
the development and use of non-intrusive techniques. 
Due to the limited number of data points available for 
each patient, monitoring a patient’s disease requires 
methods with particularly high accuracy and reproduci-
bility [1]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems 
are rapidly gaining popularity as clinical diagnostic 
tools, making good use of medical image analysis for 
quantitative studies and brain tissue segmentation. Many 
approaches for MRI brain tissue segmentation have 
been proposed and studied, such as a specific probabil-
ity density distribution [2.3], linear gray level homoge-
neity [4] and classification of the brain tissue present in 
the image [2.3, 5]. We have developed a fusion tech-
nique that is robust and shows a high performance level 
in brain tissue segmentation. This technique fuses the 
penalized fuzzy Hopfield neural network (PFHNN) 
clustering method and the watershed spatial algorithm. 
In the area of clustering techniques, several studies 
of brain MR image segmentation using neural networks 
have been suggested in the literature. Artificial neural 
networks have been proposed as a solution to a number 
of pattern recognition problems. The Hopfield neural 
network is one such artificial neural network that has 
unavoidable – watershed segmentation produces too 
many watershed lines to clearly demarcate important 
contours. 
III. FUZZY CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES 
Clustering is a process for classifying training 
samples in such a way that samples within a cluster are 
more similar to one another than to samples belonging 
to different clusters. In many fields, such as segmenta-
tion, pattern recognition and vector quantization, clus-
tering is an indispensable step. The fuzzy clustering 
techniques involved are reviewed as follows. 
A. Fuzzy c-means algorithm 
The FCM clustering algorithm was first introduced 
by Dunn [25], and the related formulations and algo-
rithms were extended by Bezdek [26]. The FCM ap-
proach, like conventional clustering techniques, mini-
mizes an objective function in the least squared error 
sense. For class number c(c≥2), sample number n and 
fuzzification parameter m(1<m≤∞), the algorithm 
chooses ]10[ ,X:u j,i →  so that ∑ ==

Where µi,j is the value of the jth membership grade on 
the ith sample xi. The cluster centroids w1,…, wj,…, wc 
can be regarded as prototypes for the clusters repre-
sented by the membership grades. For the purpose of 
minimizing the objective function, the cluster centroids 
and membership grades are chosen so that a high degree 
of membership occurs for samples close to the corre-
sponding cluster centroids. 
B. Penalized fuzzy c-means algorithm 
Another strategy for fuzzy clustering, called the penal-
ized fuzzy c-means (PFCM) algorithm, with the addition 
of a penalty term was proposed by Yang [27–28]. This 
is a generalized FCM algorithm, and it was shown by 
Yang that the PFCM algorithm produces more mean-
ingful and effective results than the FCM algorithm. The 
PFCM objective function is given by

Step 5. Find the results for the final class centroids. 
C.  PFHNN clustering algorithm 
The Hopfield neural network, with a simple archi-
tecture and parallel potential, has been applied in many 
fields [29–31]. In this paper, we apply the discrete Hop-
field neural network with the penalized fuzzy c-means 
strategy (PFHNN) as the clustering method. For n 
training samples and c classes, PFHNN consists of n×c 
neurons, which can be conceived as a two-dimensional 
array. Each sample is iteratively trained to update the 
neurons’ weights by using the nearest neighbor rule. 
Let j,iu  be the fuzzy state of the thj,i )(  neuron 
and j,k;j,iW  represent the interconnected weight be-
tween neuron (i, j) and neuron (k, j). A neuron (i, j) in 
the network receives weighted inputs j,k;j,iW  from each 
neuron (k, j) and a bias Ii,j from outside. The total input 
to neuron (i, j) is computed as

The PFHNN clustering technique employs fuzzy 
partitioning, such that each pixel can belong to more 
than one cluster, and associates each pixel with different 
membership values, which indicate belonging to differ-
ent clusters, of between 0 and 1. The PFHNN clustering 
criterion aims to find cluster centers that minimize the 
dissimilarity function, that is, that minimize the total 
distance between clusters and each pixel by their corre-
sponding membership values. Therefore, PFHNN clus-
tering provides accurate cluster center locations and 
gives the similarity of image regions, and similar corre-
sponding pixels or pixel groups are in the same region. 
However, determining the number of clusters is impor-
tant in the clustering algorithm. In this paper, there are 
four classes to be selected, including three brain tissue 
types – white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) – and background for MRI brain 
tissue clustering. The PFHNN algorithm for brain tissue 
segmentation is used to define the cluster centers and to 
identify each region (pixel) corresponding to the differ-
ent image cluster centers. 
IV. MERGING BASED ON STATISTICAL 
PROBABILITY FOR THE 
WATERSHED–PFHNN FUSION METHOD 
In this section, a fusion method for performing ac-
curate image segmentation is proposed. We define a 
MRF model on a RAG of watershed over-segmentation 
regions, and then the energy function is defined. The 
MRF model is based on the Gibbs energy function. To 
achieve better final segmentation results that map wa-
tershed segmented results to clustering statistical prob-
abilities, watershed segmented regions and PFHNN 
clustering results are fused. 
A. MRF model on the RAG 
In order to improve the results mentioned above, 
the MRF is constructed from an image processed by WS 
and defined on the corresponding RAG. According to 
the over-segmented regions, with every region corre-
sponding to a vertex, many spatially-connected regions 
define the structure of the graph. Therefore, we can 
construct a RAG that corresponds to the set of regions 
in the over-segmented regions. Edges connect 
neighboring regions; therefore two adjacent regions’ 
nodes connected by an edge in the RAG have a common 
boundary. Then, to label the regions, we define the MRF 
model on a RAG of the initial over-segmented regions. 
Suppose the image is initially segmented into K partition 
regions. Let S define a discrete label set of K sites S = 
{1, 2,…, K}, where each site represents a region in the 
image. A neighborhood system for S is defined as N = 
{Nj|j=1, 2,…,γ }, where Nj is the set of sites neighboring 
j. The γth order neighborhood system indicates the out-
ermost neighboring sites. There are two properties to 
consider in this neighborhood system relationship: a site 
may not be a neighbor to itself; and the neighboring 
relationship is mutual [32]. Thus, the nodes of the RAG 
incorporated with properly defined cliques and clique 
potential functions in the MRF model are used to merge 
the over-segmented regions. 
Then, according to the neighboring system, let a clique 
type for the pair (ℜx, ℜx’) be defined as a subset of the 
sites in ℜ. The collections of pairs (ℜx, ℜx’) will be de-
noted by τ, respectively, where 
 , ,|),{( '' ℜ∈ℜ∈ℜℜℜ= xxxxx Nτ   
.,...,2,1 Kx =  (15)
Therefore, we use the clique pair (ℜx, ℜx’) to construct 
the energy function, which is described in the next 
paragraph. 
B. Markov Random Field Model Based on the Gibbs 
Energy Function 
The spatially connected regions constitute a 
neighborhood system according to the neighboring rela-
tionship. The MRF can then be represented by the Gibbs 
distribution, which is defined as a function of energy 
and used to evaluate the probability of region merging. 
The function of energy is defined by the following [32]: 
,)(

− ×=  (16)
where Z is a normalizing constant given by

f
eZ
−∑=  (17)
T is temperature, and )( fU  is defined as the energy 
function 
∑=
τ τ
υ )()( ffU  (18)
The energy function is the sum of clique potentials 
)( fτυ  over all possible cliques τ. Here, an auto-logistic 
model was used because it can be generalized to a 
multi-level logistic (MLL) model [32−35]. Clique po-
tential depends on the type τ (size, shape and possibly 
orientation) of the clique. In this paper, the clique τ is 
the watershed over-segmented regions relationship. 
Therefore, the potential function for a pair (ℜx, ℜx’) of 
cliques is written as follows. MLL clique potentials are 
then defined by: 
=),( 'xx ffτυ =⎩⎨
⎧
∂−
∂
  clique on sites if  , τ
τ
τ
label, clustering same  thehave ),( 'xx ℜℜ
otherwise.  
(19)
When the MLL is chosen, the probability )( xfP  of 
the over-segmented regions ℜx can be calculated from 
)( 'xx f,fτυ  using the corresponding Gibbs distribution. 
The over-segmented regions corresponding to the Gibbs 
distribution energy function can be generated by a 
merging algorithm (as in section 4.4). Consequently, if 
the segmented region probability )( xfP  and that of 
the neighboring region )( yfP  satisfy the energy func-
one, the more similar the regions ℜx and ℜy are consid-
ered to be, and the more they need to be merged. We 
can formulate a test of our hypothesis using the t test to 
decide whether to merge over-segmented regions. In 
equation (28), t is a decision function which is TRUE if 
ℜx and ℜy can be merged, while otherwise it is FALSE.

If )|P(
xNx ff  hypothesis testing is TRUE, the re-
gions ℜx and ℜy are declared as similar regions and are 
merged into one region. From equation (28), the regions 
merging will form segmented regions of spatial infor-
mation and fuse cluster features to integrate the advan-
tages of both the watershed and PFHNN clustering al-
gorithms. In this step, the neighboring regions are 
merged according to given criteria to achieve a final 
segmentation. In the following paragraphs, it is shown 
that the merging algorithm incorporating topological 
and PFHNN clustering information yield efficient re-
sults. 
 
D. Merging Regions Based on the Correlation Coeffi-
cient in the Proposed Method 
 
The correlation coefficient is calculated for 
neighboring regions, expressing the degree of similarity 
between two adjacent regions. Adjacent regions are 
considered similar when they have a large correlation 
coefficient value; accordingly, in the merging step, ad-
jacent regions with large correlation coefficient values 
are chosen for merging. The final segmentation is 
achieved by merging all the similar neighboring regions 
until the number of regions is equal to number of 
ground truth regions. This procedure is summarized in 
the following: 
 
Merging Algorithm 
Objective: From an initial over-segmented image an 
RAG is constructed and processed using 
a merging criterion until the number of 
regions is equal to number of ground 
truth regions. 
Input: Original image and initial segmented image. 
Output: Final segmented image. 
Steps: 
1. Initialize the RAG with the elements so that 
the region statistical relationships are set up. 
2. Calculate the energy required in step 1. 
3. Set initial p-value to 1.00 – otherwise the 
p-value subtracts 0.01 from itself. Begin the 
iterative process of calculating the probability 
values of adjacent regions according to hy-
pothesis testing – if the t test is TRUE and the 
number of watershed segmented regions is 
greater than the number of ground truth re-
gions (or the threshold value of the p-value is 
equal to 0.95 in real images), adjacent regions 
ℜx and ℜy are to be merged. 
4. Select any one of the nodes, say ℜx, and one 
of its neighbors, say ℜy. 
5. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for region ℜx and its 
neighbor ℜy. 
6. Repeat steps 4, 5 and 6 for all regions until all 
adjacent regions’ relationship hypothesis test-
ing t test is FALSE and the number of seg-
mented regions is equal to the number of 
ground truth regions. 
7. Stop. {Final segmentation result has been ob-
tained.} 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Because medical brain images usually contain 
noise and artifacts, automated tissue classification be-
comes a challenging task. It is also difficult to capture 
the complexity and artifacts of MRI brain images. 
Therefore, synthetic MR brain tissue images originating 
from digital brain phantom simulated data are proposed 
by the Brain Web MR simulator [36−37] for use in this 
paper. These digital brain phantom images consist of all 
tissue class information; for example, a discrete ana-
tomical model is provided, which consists of a class 
label (integer) at each voxel. In this paper, we select 
four tissues types in brain phantom images, including 
GM, WM, CSF and background: other tissues are re-
garded as background. Therefore, as the classification of 
these images is already known, and the data including 
different types of artifacts, i.e. the in-homogeneity (RF) 
and the noise levels, are available, these images can be 
used as a gold standard to evaluate segmentation results. 
We selected images with different RF levels and noise 
levels. The image with 0% noise and 0% RF is denoted 
as 0N00RF, and the one with 3% noise and 0% RF is 
denoted as 3N00RF, and so on. The five MR phantom 
images, 0N00RF, 3N00RF, 3N20RF, 9N00RF and 
9N40RF, used in this study are shown in Fig. 2 (a)–(e). 
In the following evaluation criterion, numeric validation 
was performed globally in all cases, by quantifying the 
accuracy of the segmentation in the phantom images. 
The segmented brain images used in the beginning 
of the experiment do not usually include the skull and 
other non-brain tissues from the structural images of the 
head. Therefore, the first step is to strip the skull and 
other non-brain tissues from the structural images of the 
head before using the segmented image. There are many 
methods that can be used to accomplish this task: 
Ségonne et al. [38] proposed a hybrid approach that 
combines watershed algorithms and deformable surface 
models; Audrey H. Zhuang et al. [39] proposed a 
model-based level set; and Mykkänena et al. [40] pro-
posed an automatic extraction of the brain surface and 
mid-dagittal functional positron emission tomography 
images. We used the approach in [41]. The stripping 
result of the gold standard image is shown in Fig. 3 (a), 
which has sixty regions, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). The 
results from each simulated image are then compared to
