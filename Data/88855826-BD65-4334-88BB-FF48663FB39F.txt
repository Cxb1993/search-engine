simultaneously but also converges rapidly to the 
primal-dual optimal solution. The project is aimed to 
study the load bearing capacity of strain-hardening 
structures by using sequential limit analysis based 
on a primal-dual method. Thanks to the efforts made 
by the project teammates, the project has run 
smoothly. In addition, project benefits much from the 
exchange and cooperation with some other scholars. We 
have extended sequential limit analysis to deal with 
nonlinear combined isotropic/kinematic hardening. The 
corresponding static and kinematic formulations were 
stated, respectively. In particular, a generalized 
H&ouml；lder inequality was utilized to establish the 
kinematic formulation of sequential limit analysis 
from the corresponding static formulation. The 
primal-dual interior-point algorithm provided by 
Matlab is incorporated with the concept of sequential 
limit analysis. For comparisons and validations, the 
combined isotropic/kinematic material model was also 
implemented in the user-defined material subroutine 
for the commercial finite-element code Abaqus. 
Overall speaking, the project has been performed as 
proposed. Two students in the master program have 
acquired appropriate training during the execution of 
the project. In addition, a part of research results 
has been presented in an international conference. 
Also, several journal papers have been published or 
in preparation.

2002). It not only calculates the upper bound and the lower bound simultaneously but 
also converges rapidly to the primal-dual optimal solution. However, limit and 
shakedown analysis seldom utilize the duality between the upper bound and the lower 
bound formulations in numerical aspects Vu et al. (2004a).  
In plasticity problems, Hwee et al. (1984) proposed a combined upper and lower 
bound analysis to calculate the values of kinematic and static variables together with 
the true collapse load for some simple examples. But for complex problems, the 
techniques of mathematical programming and scientific computing are required. On 
the other hand, a primal-dual algorithm based on the interior-point method was 
developed to minimize a sum of Euclidean norms by Andersen et al. (2000). They 
showed that the application of the duality combining with Newton method may lead 
to very accurate results in limit analysis. Based on the work of Andersen et al. (2000), 
Vu et al. (2004a, 2004b, 2007) then presented a primal-dual algorithm for shakedown 
analysis involving the von Mises yield criterion. It was revealed that the primal-dual 
method takes the advantages of both the kinematic and the static approaches (Vu et al., 
2007). On the other hand, Tran et al. (2009) improved the primal-dual algorithm (Vu 
et al., 2004a) to acquire the limit load and the shakedown limit by using an 
edge-based smoothed finite element method (ES-FEM). Note that, Tran et al. (2009) 
and Vu et al. (2004a, 2004b, 2007) utilized a Newton and Newton-like iterations, 
respectively, to calculate simultaneously both the upper and lower bounds for limit 
and shakedown analysis. However, it is mentioned by Vu et al. (2004a) that Newton 
method was not applied effectively in shakedown analysis though it has shown high 
competence in limit analysis. 
The three-year (2000.8~2013.7) ranged project is planned to utilize primal-dual 
techniques of mathematical programming to enhance the academic contribution and 
practical applications of research results. In the long run, it is aimed to contribute to 
structural design and safety assessment under proportional or variable repeated loads 
by numerically building up a direct-method framework of primal-dual limit and 
shakedown analysis. In the first phase (2010.8~2011.7) of the three-year ranged 
project, we established the theoretical framework of the primal-dual algorithm for 
limit and shakedown analysis. On the other hand, numerical implementation of the 
primal-dual algorithm for limit and shakedown analysis will be dealt with in the 
second phase (2011.8~2012.7) and the third phase (2012.8~2013.7), respectively. The 
step-by-step inelastic analysis by the commercial finite-element code will be 
conducted for critical comparisons. 
 
2. Task and Results 
The following sections are to illustrate simply the research principles and

bound for each step on kinematically admissible solutions. 
 
2.3. Exact limit solution 
The primal–dual problems (1) and (2) are convex programming problems (Huh 
and Yang, 1991; Yang, 1993). Thus, there exist a unique maximum and minimum to 
problems (1) and (2), respectively. Accordingly, the extreme values of the lower 
bound functional ( )σq  and its corresponding upper bound functional ( )uq v  are 
equal to the unique, exact solution ∗q  for each step in a process. Namely 
maximize ( )σq ∗= q =minimize ( )uq v            (3) 
 In the project, illustrative examples are focused on truss structures, cylindrical 
pressure vessels and spherical pressure vessels. We have extended sequential limit 
analysis to deal with nonlinear combined isotropic/kinematic hardening. The 
Frederick-Armstrong kinematic hardening model (Armstrong and Frederick, 1966) 
was adopted and the Voce hardening law (Voce, 1955) was incorporated for isotropic 
hardening behavior. The primal-dual interior-point algorithm provided by Matlab is 
incorporated with the concept of sequential limit analysis and compared to the results 
obtained by the elastic-plastic analysis performed by the computer code Abaqus. For 
comparisons and validations, the combined isotropic/kinematic material model was 
also implemented in the user-defined material subroutine for the commercial 
finite-element code Abaqus. 
 
3. Self-Evaluation of Research Results 
Overall speaking, the project has been performed as proposed. Two students in 
the master program have acquired appropriate training during the execution of the 
project. In addition, a part of research results has been presented in an international 
conference. Also, several journal papers are to appear or in preparation.

Note that, it is found that the derived kinematic formulation involving combined isotropic and 
kinematic hardening cylindrical vessels can be shown to be equivalent to that by the 
bipotential concept [6]. In the paper, both static and kinematic limit analysis problems are 
analytically performed. Particularly, the equality relation between the greatest lower bound 
and the least upper bound can be confirmed explicitly. Accordingly, exact solutions of plastic 
limit pressure with integral terms are developed for combined isotropic/kinematic hardening 
for the von Mises materials in the form as
