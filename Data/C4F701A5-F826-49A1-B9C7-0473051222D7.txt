of half-space medium due to harmonic vibration of a rigid circular plate. The components 
of harmonic vibration of the plate are torsional, vertical, horizontal and rocking motions. 
To solve the problem of wave propagation in half-space medium, Liou [12] have 
developed a technique to decompose the applied tractions induced by vibrations of plate. 
These decomposed tractions will be easily fitted into the analytic solutions of three 
dimensional wave equations in cylindrical coordinates. This technique was employed to 
generate the impedance functions for circular plate on half-space medium by  
Liou et al [13]. The presented procedure in the paper will extend the work of Reference 13 
to generate the vibration at any location on half-space medium due to a harmonic loading 
applied at a rigid circular plate.  
    In order to simulate the distribution of interaction tractions between rigid plate and 
surrounding medium, piecewise linear distribution in r-direction of cylindrical coordinates 
is assumed. Based on this assumption, the impedance functions for the plate can be 
obtained by enforcing compatibility condition, using variational principal and reciprocal 
theorem. The vibration at any specific location on half-space medium can also be 
calculated for the cases of applying harmonic loadings at the plate. 
    Numerical results for a rigid circular plate subjected to torsional, vertical, horizontal 
and rocking loadings are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
proposed scheme .The numerical results will be presented in the nondimensional forms. In 
the numerical investigations, spatial dilution of vibrations and attenuation due to material 
damping of half-space medium will be discussed. Also, some comments about the 
presented scheme and numerical results will be made.

 Numerical Investigation 
 
   In the semi-infinite integrations of Eq. (6) and (9), singular point may exist, provided 
there is no damping assumed for half-space medium. This is because  in matrix Q  
in Eq.(2a) when wave number  is equal to Rayleigh wave number. Although technique 
such as residue theorem may be used to calculate the integration around the singular point, 
material damping is introduced in half-space medium in order to comply with the more 
realistic situation of medium, and hysteretic type of damping is chosen. This means shear 
modulus  in Eqs.(2) is complex and can be expressed as 
0Λ =
k
G (1 2 )= + iG G ξ  in which ξ  
is damping ratio. Therefore, numerical integration scheme can be directly employed. In the 
study, Poisson ratio of half-space medium is assumed to be 0.33. Furthermore, using the 
following two statements, the integrand in the semi-infinite integral of Eq.(9) can be easily 
shown to be proportional to 3
1
k
 and the integrand in Eq.(6) is proportional to 2

and 1 1( ) ( ) ( )− −= − +∫ ∫n n nr nrJ kr dr J kr J kr drk k , and 0.51( ) ∝nJ kr k as , it is 
concluded that the elements of matrix

It is therefore appropriate to replace the infinite integration limit with a finite number 
without losing accuracy.      
 After some convergence study, the followings can be concluded : (1)  for the 
number of subinterval in Eqs.(3) is enough to accurately describe the distribution of 
interaction tractions between plate and half-space medium; (2) To approximate the 
semi-infinite integrals of Eqs.(6) and (9), the upper limit of integration is controlled by 
Eq.(6), Since the integrand in Eq.(9) is proportional to

0.02, 0.03 and 0.05
R
 are selected for half-space medium. The reason to select the case 
of very low damping ( ) is to check and approximate the behavior of vibration 
in the medium without material damping. Figs. 2-13 show the results of vibration 
amplitudes along the nondimensional distance from center of circular plate. In Figs. 2-13, 
the distance  is nondimensionalized as

 material damping is getting more significant for attenuation of vibration. 
Also, the vibration decays along the distance smoothly. Figs.3 and 4 show the vibration 
amplitudes of  and r zu  respectively due to unit nondimensional vertical force. Looking 
at these two figures, one can observe that the vibration attenuate over the distance only 
from marco view of point, the amplitudes of vibration along the distance fluctuate, the 
fluctuation becomes more dramatic as damping getting higher and the period of the 
 15
for greater  , since Rayleigh wave is confined in the depth near free surface. z
Figs. 6~8 show the results of three components ,  and ru zu θu  induced by unit 
nondimensional horizontal excitation. Comparing these three figures to Figs. 4-5, one can 
observe similar phenomenon of local fluctuation except the fluctuation becomes more 
dramatic. Eq.(18) is employed to calculate the average energy flux intensity at = 0z
ru
 
induced by unit nondimensional horizontal excitation. The results are shown in Fig.9. 
From the figure, one can see that the fluctuation is greatly reduced. For the case of unit 
normalized rocking excitation, Figs. 10-12 show the results of the three components , 
 and zu θu . From these three figures, similar fluctuation phenomenon is observed. 
However, the fluctuation is less dramatic. Also, Eq.(18) is used to compute the average 
energy flux intensity and the results are shown in Fig.13. Again, the fluctuation for the 
results of average energy flux intensity is dramatically reduced.
