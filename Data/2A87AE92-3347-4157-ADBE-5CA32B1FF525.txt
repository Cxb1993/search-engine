Abstract 
In this study, ultra-thin films of AlCrTaTiZrRu senary high-entropy alloy (HEA) and its nitrides (HEAN) 
were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering under different N2 flow ratios. The diffusion resistence of these 
films was examined to verify their potential in barrier application. During deposition, HEA, HEAN0.06 and 
HEAN0.5 of 5 nm thick were obtained by adjusting the N2/(Ar+N2) flow rations from 0 to 30%. From analyses, 
it was realized that no interdiffusion or interface reactions occurred in the Si/HEA/Cu, Si/HEAN0.06/Cu and 
Si/HEAN0.5/Cu film stacks after annealing at 800C; the electrical resistance of the film stacks remained low, 
indicating the effective inhibition of the interdiffusion of Cu and Si by the HEA, HEAN0.06 and HEAN0.5 at 
the temperature. Only at 900C, a large amount of Cu3Si crystalline phase formed, and the electrical resistance 
drastically increased, indicating the failure of these barrier layers. Moreover, the HEA possesses low electrical 
resistivity and an amorphous structure, presenting an excellent application potential.

1. 前言 
隨著超大型積體電路製程技術精進，元件尺寸快速縮小；而當線路尺寸縮小至 65 nm 以下之世代
時，將造成嚴重之時間延遲問題 [1]。為克服此問題，傳統鋁金屬內連線已廣泛被低電阻係數的銅所取
代；但銅也有其缺點，在溫度低於 200°C 的環境下，銅便容易與矽反應成銅矽化合物 [2]，一旦銅擴散
進矽基板中將快速損壞元件性能，故需要一有效的擴散阻障層來防止銅原子的擴散。理想的擴散阻障
層須具有高熱穩定性、與銅矽有良好界面附著性、低電阻係數、不易與其他物質反應等特性。 
在擴散阻障層材料的發展上，目前已有許多單一過渡金屬的氮化物被研究，如：TaN [3]、TiN [4]、
及 MoN [5] 等，然而 TaN 與 MoN 因電阻值偏高會增加電阻-電容延遲效應，而 TiN 則因易形成柱狀
晶之微結構，其晶界會提供快速擴散路徑使銅矽交互擴散，這些缺點使得單一元素氮化物阻障層的應
用受到限制，無法繼續滿足尺寸日益縮小的銅內連線需求。近幾年來，擴散阻障層材料的研究不再侷
限於單一元素的氮化物，其中以成分及結構的設計可分為兩類：(1) 添加第三個元素以改善阻障性質，
如 Ta-Si-N [6]、Ru-Ti-N [7]、Ta-Ge-N [8] 等；(2) 以雙層結構改善阻障性質，如 Mo/W-N [9]、Zr-Si-N/Zr 
[10]、Ru/TaN [11] 等。

Ultra-thin (AlCrTaTiZr)Nx/AlCrTaTiZr Bilayer Structures of High Diffusion 
Resistance to Cu Metallization

National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan 
In this study, (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7 and (AlCrTaTiZr)N1 films of only 
10 nm thick have been developed as diffusion barrier materials for 
Cu interconnects. An AlCrTaTiZr buffer layer of 5 nm thick was 
deposited on these barriers to form (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7/AlCrTaTiZr 
and (AlCrTaTiZr)N1/AlCrTaTiZr bilayer structures, as well as to 
improve the interface adhesion to Cu layers. The as-deposited 
AlCrTaTiZr and (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7 films were amorphous, while 
the (AlCrTaTiZr)N1 was observed as a nanocomposite structure 
with nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix. At a high 
temperature of 800°C, Cu began to penetrate into the AlCrTaTiZr 
buffer layer, but its diffusion was retarded by the (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7
and (AlCrTaTiZr)N1 barriers. At an extremely high temperature of 
900°C, the interdiffusion of Si and Cu atoms occurred through the 
(AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7/AlCrTaTiZr bilayer, and Cu silicides formed; 
whereas the (AlCrTaTiZr)N1/AlCrTaTiZr bilayer remained stable. 
No interdiffusion through the (AlCrTaTiZr)N1/AlCrTaTiZr bilayer 
or formation of any silicides was identified, indicating an excellent 
diffusion resistance. 
Introduction 
Nitride films of transition metals, such as TiN and TaN, have been widely used as barrier 
materials in interconnects to inhibit rapid Cu diffusion and to improve the interface 
adhesion between Cu and dielectrics (1-5). A good thermal stability and a low electrical 
resistivity, as well as the ability to induce Cu (111) texture and to reduce Cu migration, 
are additionally required for barrier materials. However in the barrier layers, rapid 
diffusion paths for Cu atoms provided by some microstructure defects, such as grain 
boundaries and columnar structures, lower the diffusion resistance of the barrier layers 
consequently. To fulfill the strict demands for Cu interconnects in the manufacturing 
generations below 65 nm, some other nitride systems of ternary or even quaternary 
components and/or layered structures are of great interest and have been continually 
developed (6-14). In those studies, the additions of other elements or composition 
modifications in the TiN and TaN systems, such as Ta-W-N, Ta-Ge-(O)N, Ta-Si-N, Ru-
Ti-N, Ru-Ta-N etc., are found to effectively enhance the diffusion resistance of the 
conventional barrier materials (6-10). Furthermore, layer-stacked structures, including 
Mo/W-N, Zr/Zr-Si-N, Ru/TaN, Ir/TaN, etc., to elongate diffusion distances and also to 
improve interface adhesion are emphasized as well (11-14). However, extraordinary 
barrier materials with a high thermal stability and great diffusion resistance at an 
extremely high temperature up to 900°C have been rarely reported.

Chemical compositions of the HEANx and HEA films were measured by field-emission 
electron probe micro-analyses (FE-EPMA, JEOL JXA-8800M). A glancing incident 
angle (0.5°) X-ray diffractometer (GIA-XRD, Rigaku Dmax 2000) with Cu Kα radiation 
was used to analyze the crystal structures. A high-resolution transmission electron 
microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM-3000F) was applied to examine the microstructures 
and lattice structures of the film stacks. The depth profiling analyses of elemental 
distributions in the film stacks were performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS, ULVAC-PHI, PHI 5000). Sheet resistance of the HEANx and HEA films and the 
Si/HEANx/HEA/Cu film stacks was measured by a four-point probe station (Keithely). 
Results and Discussion 
Basic characterizations of (AlCrTaTiZr)Nx/AlCrTaTiZr bilayers
Figure 1 plots the chemical compositions of as-deposited HEA, HEAN0.7 and HEAN1
films measured by EPMA. Basically, except the lower contents of Al than designed 
values in the HEA and HEAN0.7 films due to a resputtering effect of the light element, the 
contents of the other metallic elements in all films were rather uniform, in a near-
equimolar ratio and close to the designed compositions. For the metallic HEA film 
deposited without an N2 flow, the contents of Cr, Ta, Ti and Zr were measured as about 
22 at%. For the HEAN0.7 film deposited with an N2 flow ratio of 10%, the contents of Cr, 
Ta, Ti and Zr were about 12 at%, and the content of N was about 41 at%; the N-to-HEA 
ratio was calculated as about 0.7, and this film was regarded as an unsaturated nitride. For 
the HEAN1 film deposited with an N2 flow ratio of 30%, the contents of all metallic 
elements were about 10 at%, and the content of N was about 49 at%; the N-to-HEA ratio 
was about 1.0, and this film was regarded as a saturated nitride. The contents of O in the 
HEA and HEANx films were controlled at a low level less than 2 at%.

Figures 2 and 3 show the HR-TEM images of as-deposited Si/HEAN0.7/HEA/Cu and 
Si/HEAN1/HEA/Cu film stacks, respectively. First, from Fig. 2 (a) and 3 (a), the layer-
stacked structures of Si substrate, HEANx barrier layer, HEA buffer layer and Cu film 
were clearly observed, and an amorphous native oxide layer of about 3-5 nm thick 
existed at the Si/HEANx interfaces. Between the HEANx and HEA films, as well as 
between the HEA and Cu films, slight interdiffusion zones of about 2 nm thick were

solution structure in the HEAN1 film from all composed nitrides, and it confirmed the 
effect of a high mixing entropy on the random configuration of components and the 
simplification of structures (17). Surrounding the nanocrystallites, no obvious grain 
boundaries were recognized; instead, an amorphous matrix with disordered atom 
distributions was observed, indicating the coexistence of both crystalline and amorphous 
phases to construct a nitride nanocomposite film. These analyses also indicated that, in 
spite of the use of a complex material system with multiple components, the deposited 
films still exhibited uniform compositions and simple structures.

The electrical resistivity of the as-deposited HEA, HEAN0.7 and HEAN1 films was 
measured as 250 (± 9), 335 (± 5), and 1586 (± 25) μΩ·cm respectively. The resistivity of 
the HEA film was higher than the values of common metallic elements since a large 
lattice distortion in the alloy film was believed to obstruct the movement of electrons. 
With a high N-to-HEA ratio of 1, the resistivity jumped up due to a saturated N content 
though, it was just three times the value of typical barrier materials, 500 μΩ·cm (26). 
However, resistivity of (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7/AlCrTaTiZr and (AlCrTaTiZr)N1/AlCrTaTiZr 
bilayers was calculated as about 300 and 570 μΩ·cm, respectively, which was rather 
close to or even lower than the value of typical barriers and suggested the high potentials 
of these two bilayer structures as candidates for diffusion barrier layers.

Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of Si/HEAN0.7/HEA/Cu and Si/HEAN1/HEA/Cu
film stacks before and after thermal annealing at 700 to 900°C. In these diffraction 
patterns, the peaks at 43.4°, 50.6° and 74.3° corresponded to the (111), (200) and (220) 
lattice planes of fcc Cu, and the Cu films showed a strong (111) orientation. After 
annealing at 700 and 800°C, all of the peaks remained unchanged, except enhanced 
intensities because of the grain growth of the Cu films. Only at 900°C, the HEAN0.7/HEA
bilayer failed as a diffusion barrier; the interdiffusion and reaction of Si and Cu through 
this bilayer occurred, thus inducing the appearance of Cu3Si compound phase with two 
diffraction peaks at 44.7° and 45.4° in the 900°C-annealed Si/HEAN0.7/HEA/Cu film 
stack as seen in Fig. 4 (a). In comparison, the HEAN1/HEA bilayer still acted as an 
effective barrier to the interdiffusion of Si and Cu atoms even at the extremely high 
temperature; no signals of any Cu silicides or other crystalline compound phases were 
detected in the 900°C-annealed Si/HEAN1/HEA/Cu film stack as shown in Fig. 4 (b). 
The SEM observations of 800 and 900°C-annealed film stacks shown in Fig. 5 and 6 
confirmed the above analyses. As seen in Fig. 5 (a) and 6 (a), no compound or faceted 
structures formed after annealing at 800°C, and the film stacks remained as deposited 
features. At 900°C, severe reactions in the Si/HEAN0.7/HEA/Cu film stack occurred with 
a destroyed layer structure as seen in Fig. 5 (b); whereas as seen in Fig. 6 (b), rather than 
any reactions, only some agglomeration of he Cu film occurred on the Si/HEAN1/HEA/
Cu film stack, indicating a good resistance of the HEAN1/HEA bilayer to Cu diffusion at 
the high temperature.

The depth profiling analyses of Cu, Si and N element contents in as-deposited and 
thermally annealed Si/HEAN0.7/HEA/Cu and Si/HEAN1/HEA/Cu film stacks were 
further performed by XPS and plotted in Fig. 7. From the elemental distributions, the 
minimized interdiffusion of Si and Cu through the HEAN0.7/HEA and HEAN1/HEA
bilayers was realized. In the as-deposited stack structures, the top Cu films, the barriers, 
and the Si substrates were clearly identified though the interface between the HEA and 
the HEAN0.7 or HEAN1 layers was not distinguished due to small film thicknesses. After 
annealing at 800°C, slight amounts of Cu and Si began to penetrate into the HEAN0.7/
HEA bilayer as seen in Fig. 7 (a), but their diffusion was basically confined in the bilayer 
region, implying 800°C being the critical temperature for the HEAN0.7/HEA bilayer to 
retain its diffusion resistance. In comparison as seen in Fig. 7 (b), the HEAN1/HEA
bilayer through which no obvious diffusion of Si occurred at even 900°C presented an 
outstanding barrier ability in accordance with aforementioned XRD analyses and SEM 
observations. However, due to Cu agglomeration and the exposure of the HEAN1/HEA 
bilayer as previously seen in Fig. 6 (b), the signal of N was detected since surface, and 
the signal of Cu was falsely found in the bilayer and substrate regions. Nevertheless, the 
high and constant content of Cu with depth implied that the detected Cu signal was not 
attributed to an interdiffusion behavior; instead, it indicated that two structures (the 
agglomerated Cu and exposed HEAN1/HEA bilayer) were simultaneously detected on the 
surface of the specimen during XPS analyses.

HEA/Cu film stacks (pre-sputtering for surface cleaning was carried out. Circle: Cu, up 
triangle: Si, diamond: N; open symbols: as deposited, solid symbols: annealed). 
The imited interdiffusion of Si and Cu through the bilayer structures was confirmed 
by the variations in the sheet resistance of Si/HEAN0.7/HEA/Cu and Si/HEAN1/HEA/Cu
film stacks after thermal annealing as plotted in Fig. 8. The resistance of as-deposited 
film stacks was measured as about 0.04-0.08 Ω/. After annealing at 700 and 800°C,
because of grain growth and defect elimination of the Cu films, the resistance decreased 
to 0.02 Ω/, again interpreting the good barrier performance of both bilayers. Only at 
900°C, the HEAN0.7/HEA bilayer failed, and a Cu3Si compound formed; consequently 
the resistance of the Si/HEAN0.7/HEA/Cu film stack drastically jumped to 452 Ω/.
However for the Si/HEAN1/HEA/Cu film stack, its resistance just slightly increased to

A bias and thermal stress (BTS) test is typically applied in the semiconductor industry 
for evaluating the diffusion resistance of barrier materials and offers the advantage of in-
situ tracking the degradation of microelectronic devices caused by migrated Cu ions (27). 
However, in academic researches, due to the limit of metrology tools, most of the studies 
on barrier abilities are performed conventionally by thermal annealing and the subsequent 
microscopic characterizations of interface reactions and depth-profiling analyses of 
element accumulations (6-14). In the present study, although the diffusion resistance of 
the HEANx/HEA bilayers is also evaluated by the conventional method, rather than the 
BTS test, nevertheless, in comparison with other reported barrier layers (1-14), the better 
performance of the bilayer structures developed herein of a comparable or even smaller 
thickness and examined under stricter conditions indicates a high potential for their 
application to diffusion barriers.

number of rapid diffusion paths and thus provides a high resistance to the diffusion of 
atoms. Without the effect of high mixing entropies, a large number of crystalline 
compound phases and/or individual nitrides would then form, within which no large 
lattice distortions would exist and between which grain boundaries would develop, as 
most frequently observed in conventional barrier materials of low diffusion resistance. 
Conclusions
In this study, (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7/AlCrTaTiZr and (AlCrTaTiZr)N1/AlCrTaTiZr bilayer 
structures were developed as diffusion barrier materials for Cu interconnects based on the 
concept of high mixing entropy. The diffusion resistance of the bilayer structures to Cu 
metallization was characterized under thermal annealing at 700 to 900°C. From the 
analyses, it was found that the AlCrTaTiZr metallic buffer layer and (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7
barrier layer were amorphous, and the (AlCrTaTiZr)N1 barrier layer had a nanocomposite 
structure. At a high temperature of 800°C, Cu penetration into the AlCrTaTiZr buffer 
layer just began but was retarded by the (AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7 and (AlCrTaTiZr)N1 barrier 
layers; thus the electrical resistance of the film stacks remained at low levels. Only at an 
extremely high temperature of 900°C, the interdiffusion of Si and Cu atoms through the 
(AlCrTaTiZr)N0.7/AlCrTaTiZr bilayer occurred, and Cu silicides formed; the electrical 
resistance then increased. However, the (AlCrTaTiZr)N1/AlCrTaTiZr bilayer remained 
thermally stable, and neither interdiffusion through the bilayer or formation of silicides 
occurred at 900°C, indicating an excellent diffusion resistance of the bilayer structure. 
Large lattice distortions and a nanocomposite structure without grain boundaries were the 
dominant factors for the (AlCrTaTiZr)N1/AlCrTaTiZr bilayer being an effective barrier 
material to inhibit Cu diffusion.
