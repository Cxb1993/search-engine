acceptable wide-angle and wideband visible antireflective effect for the incident angle ranging in 
0-30o. Moreover, a wide angle and wideband visible AR of PES with the incident angle up to 50o 
from the normal was designed by the vibrating search approach and then coated using IAD 
technique. It was shown that their performances were very comparable and revealed quite 
acceptable.

1. Introduction 
Antireflection (AR) coating belongs to the most important optical thin film designs [1] and has 
been extensively used in various optical systems. The uses of AR coatings exceed the sum of all 
the other types of optical coatings [2], and it has the greatest impact on optical technique [3, 4]. 
The extensive applications of the AR thin-film are mainly due to it can effective reduce the 
undesired reflection loss of optical devices, and/or increase the transmittance of optical system. 
Furthermore, it can eliminate the mazy light, glare and ghost images, caused by the multiple 
reflections of optical components, to improve the contrast of optical image.  
A novel design algorithm can excite and extend the view of design field, and if it can yield a 
high performance then it is valuable to be researched in science. When the AR effect is required 
only at a single wavelength, a simple V-coating design will suffice, but when a very low-loss 
broadband AR effect is sought, the problem becomes more complex and a digital design approach 
is normally adopted [5-12]. In digital designs, the synthetic method [5-9] is generally superior to 
the method of refinement [10-12] because it can automatically produce its initial design and then 
optimizes the optical performance, using a merit function, to yield the final design. In contrast, 
the refinement method must normally begin from a known and good initial design; however, 
guessing a good initial design of a high-performance optical filter is difficult.   
In the first and second years of this project, two novel synthetic design algorithms based on 
scanning search and vibrating search were developed for designing a high-performance 
normal-incidence broadband visible or near infrared antireflection coating, respectively. It was 
shown that the AR performances for the BK-7 glass substrate were fairly high and their average 
spectral reflectivities of the final designs in the visible region of 400-750 nm and in the NIR 
region of 800-1600 nm, obtained by the scanning search and vibrating search methods of a 
two-material multi-layer system, can be reduced below 0.042 and 0.040% for the visible region 
and 0.085 and 0.064% for the NIR region, respectively [13, 14]. Both of the scanning search and 
vibrating search consisting of two operations can be successively used to improve the AR 
performance and simplify the design structure; its design algorithm was straightforward and the 
resultant broadband AR performance was fairly high. Furthermore, we also applied the spiral 
search (a previous proposed method for the normal AR coating design) and this vibrating search 
approach to research the wide-angle and broadband visible AR coating designs. It was shown that 
the average wide-angular spectral reflectivities of the AR designs of Bk7 in the visible region 
with the incident angle up to 50 degree from the normal, obtained by the spiral and scanning 
searches using a two-material system, can be reduced below 0.33 and 0.30%, respectively [15, 
16]. The wide-angle and broadband visible AR performances were quite good. We then used the 
vibrating search method to design a normal-incidence visible AR coating for the flexible PES 
substrate, and AR coated PES using the ion-assisted deposition. The calculated and experimented 
reflectivities for the mean visible AR performances of a six-layered oxide-film system can be 
reduced from 6.018% for the uncoated PES to lower than 0.321 and 0.327%, respectively, which 
showing the calculated and experimented AR performances were quite agreement with each other 
and also very acceptable. Besides, this normal-incidence AR coating also presented a quite 
acceptable wide-angle and wideband visible antireflective effect for the incident angle up to 30o 
from the normal. In addition, a wide angle and wideband visible AR of PES with the incident 
angle up to 50o from the normal was designed and AR coated using IAD. It was shown that the 
theoretical and experimental AR performances were close and quite acceptable as well. 
 
     2. Novel Design Algorithms, Design Results and Discussions 
 
2.1 Design Algorithm of Scanning Search  
In the first year of the study, we developed a new design method called scanning search 
approach [13, 19]. The scanning search algorithm for achieving a normal incidence wideband  
1 
system of a total physical thickness 790 nm. The film materials that used in the design were TiO2 
and MgF2 with refractive indices of nH and nL, respectively, and the distribution of layer indices 
was quantized as nH─nL─nH─nL─‧‧‧─nH─nL. The dispersion of the optical constants of the film 
materials and glass substrate shown in Table I [18] was taken into account in the calculations. The 
adjustment thickness used in the search process was 0.1 nm. After approximately 140 passes of 
the scanning operation, and 11-12 passes of different elimination operations, the results shown in 
Figs. 1 and 2 were obtained.

  Figures 1(a) and 2(a) show the scanning search designs of a visible AR coating, performed via 
different elimination operations by eliminating layers from the thin layer to the thick layer and 
eliminating layers in the direction from the last layer to the first layer, respectively, thereby 
reducing to 26-layered systems with physical thicknesses of 1112.2 and 1119.5 nm. Their 
corresponding average visible spectral reflectivities shown in Figs. 1(b) and 2(b) were reduced to 
0.042 and 0.045%. The residual reflectivities in the main visible range of 415-740 nm were 
reduced below 0.064 and 0.071%, and those maximum tail visible reflectivities were reduced 
below 0.55 and 0.22%, respectively. The average visible spectral reflectivity and residual 
reflectivity in the main visible spectral region are quite low, indicating that the resulting visible 
AR performances obtained by the scanning search method are fairly high. Besides, even if they 
start at the same initial point, different search processes lead to different final designs; however, 
the results of their AR performances are fairly good and comparable to each other.

2.2 Spiral Search Algorithm for Wide-Angle Broadband AR Coating Design 
   In the first year of the study, a spiral search is proposed to research the wide angle 
broadband visible AR coating design. The design algorithm of the spiral search method for 
obtaining a wide angle visible AR coating design is described as follows [15, 20]. 
A) Initialize the starting design with a two-material N-layer system, with all layers initially 
having the same physical thickness. 
B) In the search process, a merit function (MF) defining the average wide angular visible 
reflectivity over the 71 wavelengths of the 400-750 nm spectral region is used and given as

the reflectivity of p- and s-polarization at the angle of 50o, respectively. 
C) Spiraling searches the layer thickness of the multilayer system one by one to reduce the MF. 
The operation of spiraling search is a curling adjustment process which is carried out by first 
adjusting the thickness of layer 1; second, rotating from layer 1 to the last layer N and 
adjusting the thickness of layer N; third, rotating from the last layer N to layer 2 and adjusting 
the thickness of layer 2; fourth, rotating from layer 2 to layer N-1 and adjusting the thickness 
of layer N-1; and last, rotating to the central layer and adjusting its thicknesses. The layer 
thickness is either increased or decreased to reduce the MF and replaced by a thickness that 
yields a lower minimum MF; otherwise, it restores the original layer thickness, and the next 
layer is adjusted. When all layers have been spirally adjusted and the MF is reduced, the 
spiraling search is then performed in the next pass. Once the MF is no longer refined in a pass 
of all the layers, the spiraling search operation is terminated. 
D) The reflectivity of the large incident angle generally dramatically increases at the 
long-wavelength spectral region. To suppress this tail effect and improve the wide angular AR 
performance, an additional spiraling search process with a modified merit function MF' is 
used, in which the weighting of wavelengths greater than 730 nm in eq. (1) is replaced by w 
(>1), and the MF' is given by

Restarting the spiral search of the design obtained in step (C), the desired design is 
considered to be achieved if MF' is no longer reduced in a pass of all layers. 
 
We applied the spiral search technique to design a wide-angular visible AR coating for the 
incident angle lying in the range of 0-50o using a two-material 20-layer system starting with a 
total physical thickness of 1080 nm and the refractive indices coded as nH-nL-nH-nL-...; here, nH 
and nL were the high- and low-index of film materials TiO2 and MgF2 used in the design, 
respectively. Dispersion of optical constants of the film materials and BK7 glass substrate shown 
in Table I was taken into account in the calculations. The adjusting thickness used for the spiral 
search was 0.1 nm. After 134 passes of spiral search operations, and with w=3.8 in the additional 
spiral operation, the results were obtained and are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The value of weighting 
w chosen here was 3.8 so that the maximum residual visible reflectivity of the largest incident 
angle of 50o is minimized. We also searched many initial points of various total physical

2.3 Vibrating Search Algorithm for Normal-Incidence Broadband AR Coating Design 
   In the second year of this study, a second novel synthetic design approach based on a 
vibrating search was continue developed to research the normal [14] and wide-angle broadband 
AR coating [16]. The vibrating search for designing a very low-loss normal incidence broadband 
AR coating design is described as follows [14, 19]. 
  A) Generates the initial design of a two-material N-layer system in which all layers are of 
equal physical thickness, with the distribution of refractive indices coded in binary as 
nH-nL-nH-nL-...-nL.  
In the search process, a merit function MF that defines the average reflectance in the 
desired spectral region is given by eq. (1). 
B) The thickness of the layers in the multilayer system is vibrationally adjusted one by one to 
reduce the MF and thereby optimize the AR performance. Here, the vibrational adjustment 
process is performed by first, vibrating from the central layer N/2 to the outer layer N/2+1 and 
adjusting the thicknesses of the layers N/2 and N/2+1 accordingly; second, vibrating in the 
reverse direction from layer N/2+1 to the inner layer N/2-1 and adjusting the thicknesses of the 
layers N/2+1, N/2, and N/2-1; third, reversing the direction of vibration from layer N/2-1 to the 
outer layer N/2+2 and adjusting the thicknesses of the layers N/2-1, N/2, N/2+1, and N/2+2, and 
finally, vibrating from layer 1 to the layer N and adjusting the thicknesses of the layers 1, 2, 3,…, 
N-1, and N. The amplitude of vibration is increased by adding one layer to each alternating 
direction of the vibration adjustment, in which the vibration is centered on layer N/2. The 
thicknesses of passed layers are adjusted in sequence. When a layer is adjusted, the MF may be 
reduced by reducing or increasing the thickness of the layer. The layer thickness is changed to the 
thickness that can yield a lower minimum MF; otherwise, the original thickness is restored and 
the next layer is then adjusted. When a pass through all the layers is sought and the MF is reduced, 
the next vibration adjustment pass is then performed. When the MF is no longer refined by one 
pass through all the layers, the vibration adjustment operation is terminated. 
C) To simplify further the design structure and also to improve the AR performance, the 
following various vibration-eliminating operations are performed: 
  a) Eliminates layers from the central layer to the outer layer, and then in the reverse 
direction, and so on. 
  b) Eliminates layers from the central layer to the inner layer, and then in the reverse 
direction, and so on.  
When a layer is eliminated, the vibration adjustment operation in step (B) is restarted to 
reduce the MF. When the MF has been refined, a new simple AR coating design with a better 
performance is yielded, and the vibration-eliminating operation is then performed in the 
following pass. If the MF cannot be refined, the eliminated layer is restored and the eliminating 
operation of the next layer is then performed. Once the MF is no longer refined in a pass through 
all the layers, the vibration-eliminating operation is then terminated and the desired solution is 
considered to have been found. 
To demonstrate the design algorithm, a visible (VIS) AR coating was designed first. The 
starting design was initialized as a 60-layer two-material system with a total physical thickness of 
900 nm; the film materials were TiO2 and MgF2 with high and low refractive indices nH  and  nL, 
respectively. The VIS dispersions of the film materials and the substrate medium, presented in 
Table I, were used in the calculations, and the thickness adjustment in the search was 0.1 nm. 
Figures 6 and 7 show the results obtained after about 32 passes of the vibration adjustment 
operation and five to eight passes of the vibration-eliminating operation.  
  In Figs. 6(a) and 7(a), the vibrating search designs of the VIS AR coating, obtained using 
different vibration-eliminating operations, which involved eliminating layers from the central 
layer to the outer layer or eliminating layers from the central layer to the inner layer, are reduced 
to 28 and 26 layers, with total physical thicknesses of 1339.3 and 1313.5 nm, respectively. The 
corresponding AR performances, shown in Figs. 6(b) and 7(b), are fairly good. Their average

2.4 Vibrating Search Algorithm for Wide-Angle Wideband Visible AR Coating Design  
The vibrating search algorithm for designing a wide-angle and wideband visible AR coating 
with an incident angle up to 50 degree from the normal is given as following [16, 20]. 
A) Generate the initial design with a two-material N-homogeneous-layer system having equal 
physical thicknesses of all layers. A merit function (MF), defined as the average wide-angle 
visible reflectance of incident angles 0 and 50o over 71 equal wavelength positions in the 400-750 
nm spectral regions, used in the search process is given by eq. (5) 
  B) Vibration searches the multilayer system one by one and one layer at a time to reduce MF to 
improve the AR performance. Here, the search process is performed as follows: first, vibrate from 
layer N/2 to layer N/2+1 and adjust the thicknesses of layers N/2 and N/2+1 one by one and one at 
a time; second, reverse the vibrating direction from layer N/2+1 to layer N/2-1 and adjust the 
thicknesses of layers N/2+1, N/2, and N/2-1; third, reverse the vibrating direction from layer 
N/2-1 to layer N/2+2 and adjust the thicknesses of layers N/2-1, N/2, N/2+1, and N/2+2; fourth, 
reverse the vibrating direction from layer N/2+2 to layer N/2-2 and adjust the thicknesses of 
layers N/2+2, N/2+1, N/2, N/2-1, and N/2-2; …etc.; and last, vibrate from layer 1 to layer N and 
adjust the thicknesses of layers 1, 2, 3, …, and N, where layer 1 denotes the layer next to the 
substrate. That is, the amplitude of the vibrating search operation is increased by adding one layer 
to each new vibration adjustment and its vibration center is at layer N/2. When adjusting a layer, 
layer thickness is either decreased or increased to reduce MF and is replaced by the thickness that 
yields a lower minimum MF, otherwise, the original thickness is restored and the next layer is 
then adjusted. When a pass of all the layers is searched and MF is reduced, the next pass of 
vibrating search is then performed. Once MF is no longer improved in one pass of all layers, the 
vibrating search operation is then terminated.

2.5 AR Coating Design for Flexible PES Substrate 
We then applied this new vibrating search AR coating design approach for the flexible PES 
substrate, the dispersion of optical constants of PES needed to be considered first. We scanned the 
visible transmittance spectrum of the finite PES substrate, shown in Fig. 12(a), to calculate the 
optical constants in the visible spectral region and the results were displayed in Figs. 12(b) and 
12(c), and their fitting dispersion curves were presented in Fig. 13 and Table II. The dispersive 
values of refractive indices )(λn in Fig 12(b) were compared with the values in Fig. 14(b) 
obtained from the reflectance spectrum of an infinite PES shown in Fig. 14(a). It is shown that  
the difference of refractive index )(λnΔ is less than 10-5 revealing that these dispersive values 
)(λn are highly agreement with each other.

2.5.1 Normal-Incidence AR Coating Design for PES  
  Regard to the normal visible AR coating design of the flexible PES substrate, all oxide 
materials with the high and low refractive-index thin films TiO2 and SiO2, shown in Table II, 
were used. To avoid an over stress existing in the AR coating, the layer number of starting design 
was limited to 10. The initial point was a two-material 10-layer system with a total physical 
thickness 170 nm, and the adjusting thickness used in the vibrating search was 0.1 nm. After 55 
passes of the vibrating operation and zero pass of the different elimination operation, the results 
were obtained and are shown in Fig. 15.   
 
Figure 15(a) show the vibrating search design of a normal-incidence visible AR coating on 
PES, thereby reducing to six-layered system with a physical thicknesses of 243.9 nm. The 
corresponding average visible spectral reflectivity shown in Fig. 15(b) is reduced from 6.018% 
(uncoated substrate) to less than 0.321%. The average visible reflectivity and residual reflectivity 
in the main visible spectral region are low, showing that the resulting visible AR performance is 
very acceptable.

3. Experimental, Results and Discussions  
3.1 Experimental 
The broadband visible AR coating designs of Figs. 15(a) and 16(a) were then coated on 
flexible PES substrates using an IAD system, shown in Fig. 18, that comprised a 10 kW 
electron-beam gun and an end-Hall ion source (Veeco Mark I) with a diameter of 3 cm. The 
distances for the electron gun and the ion source to substrate were 47 and 18 cm, respectively, 
and the incident angle of the ion beam was 35o. The coating materials were TiO2 and SiO2 with a 
purity of 99.99% and the physical thickness of the films was monitored using a crystal quartz 
thickness monitor. The area and thickness of the PES substrate were 2x2 cm2 and 0.1 mm, 
respectively.

Before deposition, the base pressure of the coater chamber, 5102 −×  Torr, was realized using 
a cryopump. During the deposition, a working pressure of 4102 −×  Torr was maintained by 
introducing the mixture of O2 and Ar into the coater chamber. Film materials TiO2 and SiO2 were 
evaporated using an e-gun and IAD with ion beam voltages of 130 and 130 V, and beam currents 
of 0.5 and 0.5 mA, respectively. The growth of film thickness was controlled at a deposition rate

3.2.2 Wide-Angle Visible AR Coating of PES        
   The wide-angle and wideband visible AR performances for the AR coating design in Fig. 16(a) 
coated on a PES substrate is shown in Fig. 21. In Fig. 21(a), the mean visible reflectivity 0.641% 
for the experimental AR coating at the normal is close to 0.518% for the calculated AR design 
and is much lower than the uncoated average reflectivity 6.018%. Besides, the optical AR 
performance at the incident angle of 50o is shown in Fig. 21(b). The mean visible reflectivity at 
50 degree is 1.405% for the experimental AR coating which is better than the 1.587% for the 
theoretical design value and also much lower than the uncoated reflectivity 7.793% for the bare 
substrate. Even if there is a little discrepancy between the experimental and calculated results, 
which may be due to the deposition error in the film thickness and refractive index; however, 
their performances are close and very acceptable [21].

4. Conclusions 
We have developed two novel design methods based on scanning search and vibrating search 
algorithms for achieving a very low-loss normal-incidence broadband AR coating design in the 
visible or NIR spectral region. The search algorithms were simple and the resultant AR 
performances are fairly high. It was shown that the average spectral reflectivities of the 
broadband AR coating design of BK7 glass substrate, obtained by the scanning and vibrating 
search methods using a multi-layer system, can be reduced to below 0.042 and 0.40% for the 
visible region of 400-750 nm, and 0.085 and 0.064% for the broadband NIR AR coating design in 
the region of 800-1600 nm, respectively [13, 14]. We then use a spiral search method and applied 
the vibrating search approach to the wide-angle and wideband visible AR coating design. It was 
shown that the mean wide-angle wideband visible reflectivities for AR coating design of BK7 
glass can be reduced to 0.33 and 0.30% [15, 16], respectively, showing quite acceptable. When 
this vibrating search method was applied to the visible AR coating on the flexible PES substrate, 
started with a two-material 10-layered oxide film system, the final design was reduced to a 
6-layered design and then implemented this AR coating using an IAD technique. The average 
visible reflectivity for the calculated and experimental AR performances can be reduced to 0.321 
and 0.327%, respectively, which revealing the performances were quite satisfied and very agreed 
to each other. Besides, this normal-incidence AR coating also presented a quite acceptable 
wide-angle and wideband visible antireflective effect for the incident angle ranging in 0-30o. 
Moreover, a wide angle and wideband visible AR of PES with the incident angle up to 50o from 
the normal was designed and coated using IAD. It was shown that the wide-angle visible AR 
performances of the calculated design and practical AR coating were close and revealed quite 
acceptable.
