Abstract 
Since the recent electronic technologies develop the wireless communication, computation and sensing 
devices becoming more advance, a smart system, wireless sensor network (WSN), is proposed to monitor a 
region of interest. However, the noise in the environment may affect the local outcomes after detection. 
Moreover, these results of affected local detection cause a final decision being unreliable. This work addresses 
two new approaches to get a lower final decision error rate on the fusion center effectively. One of the 
proposed schemes uses a queue to make the final decision in the interested region, and the other scheme 
adopts a saturation counter to do the same thing. Continuously, the both schemes can degrade the decision 
error efficiently. The experimental results show that the queue length and maximum counter value can 
obviously affect the performance. Therefore, the goal of this work is to determine the best queue length and 
maximum counter value. The truth remains, however, that both queue and decision counter also bring some 
detection delay which is according to the queue length or maximum counter value adopted. Obviously a 
trade-off is between error rate and detection delay. Unfortunately, the error rate of the queue scheme is hard to 
analyze mathematically. This work only analyzes the error rate of the saturation counter scheme. The 
experimental results demonstrate that the suggested maximum counter value can get the best performance in 
different scenarios. Moreover, the scheme is superior to the conventional fusion scheme, which uses the 
well-known k-out-of-N final decision rule directly.

is meant to collect data through its sensor nodes. 
The above descriptions make a wide rage of application areas for wireless sensor network such as home, 
military, health, environment, and other commercial applications. However, a wireless sensor network has 
many constraints such as the communication range. Because the power of a sensor node relies on the battery 
to supply its operating energy, the transmitting range is only within ten meters to a hundred meters in general. 
The sensor node transmits information by multiple-hop for power saving if the base station or fusion center 
has long distance from the sensor node. 
The sensor nodes are generated in the low cost design, and therefore the interested environment may be 
deployed by hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes to monitor the condition. Since management in the huge 
amount of sensor nodes are not an easy thing, all the sensor nodes are developed to become individualities. 
Due to the low cost design in wireless sensor nodes and the noise in the environment, each sensor node is 
prone to make the unreliable decision or report the error information. Moreover, these unreliable decisions 
may affect the final decisions on the fusion center. Unfortunately, although there is a majority-vote-like rule 
such as k-out-of-N rule in the fusion center, the probability of error in a final decision still exists even through 
k is the optimal value. 
Therefore, this work proposes two methods to decrease the error rate effectively: one is the decision 
queue method, and another one is saturation counter. The idea is that using a buffer-like space to keep the 
history records. The decision queue and saturation counter are both served as a buffer to record the 
accumulation of suspected pre-decision, which is a decision depending on the k-out-of-N fusion rule directly. 
Nevertheless, these two schemes have the hysteresis characteristic. In other words, the methods both use a 
higher threshold and a lower threshold to decide whether the event condition change. 
(三) 文獻探討 
The investigations of WSN contain many topics such as WSN applications [25],decision fusion or 
decision making [5], [6], [16], [18], [22], fault tolerance or fault detection [3], [7], [9], [10], [15], [20], 
scalability [17], production costs, hardware constrains, sensor network coverage [4], [12], [13], power 
consumption [14], security, self-organization, and energy-efficient protocol [21]. However, the main theme of 
this study focuses on the final decision fusion. To improve the performance of hypothesis detection is the 
primary goal. 
Over the past few years a considerable number of studies have been made on data fusion and decision 
making. The fusion center makes a wrong final decision when the wrong local decisions are the great majority. 
A study of fusion rule to optimize k-out-of-N with threshold k has been proposed by Zhang et al. in 2002 [23]. 
As given an environment condition, the optimal k-out-of-N can be set up into fusion center to make the lower 
final decision error rate. The k-out-of-N is a majority-vote like the fusion rule [18]. Restated, there are N 
wireless sensor nodes being deployed into an area, and the fusion center makes a final decision depending on 
k of wireless sensor nodes to approve the final decision. The k is like a threshold. 
(四) 研究方法 
The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Section 4.1 describes the system model and our 
problem formulation. Section 4.2 introduces one proposed final decision scheme, decision queue. Section 4.3 
introduces another proposed final decision scheme, saturation counter. Section 4.4 presents the Monte Carlo 
simulation and mathematical result. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 
4.1 System Model and Problem Formulation 
This section introduces the system model and the problem formulation of this work. First, the wireless 
sensor network operation is illustrated. Second, the problem, which assumes that the Gaussian noise affects 
the decision results, is formulated. 
4.1.1 The System Model 
Assume that the environment condition is under a binary hypothesis, E0 or E1, and a two-layer wireless 
sensor network is considered [2], [8], [19]. An illustration from Figure 3 may be informative. This system 
consists of a fusion center and N identical wireless sensor nodes. Each member of wireless sensor nodes is 
 4 
where h is ‘0’ or ‘1’. 
Recall that the local decision rule γ employed at each node is computing the likelihood ratio test with a 
threshold λ as (4.4). 
 Aγ ≡ 
P(AxtAEAEi E | E1)
P(Axt AEiE | E0)
 A
Aut AEAEiE = 1>−<
Aut AEiE = 0
E λE (4.4) 
After some mathematical manipulations with (4.3) and (4.4), equation (4.5) can be obtained (see 
Appendix A).

AutAEi E = 0
E 
2 ln λ + (c1)2 − (c0)2
2(c1−c0)
 = K*E (4.5) 
According to the local decision rule γ, however, every wireless sensor node has a probability of normal, 
probability of false alarm, probability of miss detection, and probability of detection in local decisions. Thus, 
these probabilities in local decision can be denoted as (4.6).

where Pn, Pf, Pm and Pd are the probabilities of normal, false alarm, miss and detection separately in local 
decision. Additionally, Q(a, b, c) is defined as (4.7).

Assume that λ = 1, PEf = Pm = ε and Pn E= Pd = φ can be obtained expectably. Thus, the final decision 
accuracy by using k-out-of-N rule can also be obtained according to the binomial theorem as (4.8) and (4.9).

 EEAAPN = PD = A1−αAA = Eβ A (4.9) 
where PF, PM, PN AEand PD are probability of false alarm, probability of miss, probability of normal and 
probability of detection in final decision individually. 
The problem is that because of the noise, the fusion center has a probability α to make wrong decisions 
even the deployment has a great quantity of sensor nodes. Additionally, the greater quantity causes the higher 
cost. Therefore, this work proposes a counter scheme on the fusion center to degrade the affection of noise 
efficiently. In other words, the error rate in final decision can be decreased with effect. Moreover, how to 
decide the maximum counter value is also proposed in this work. 
15B4.2 The Decision Queue Method 
This section introduces a novel final decision scheme, which uses a decision queue to keep some 
outcomes by k-out-of-N rule. Thus, the final decision can become more reliable. More details of the proposed 
schemes are described in the following. 
 6 
example, if the fusion center has the length of queue by 7 and the conditions of queue are 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 and 0 
at time step t = 20, so the summation of values in queue AQ20 AEsumE is 2. 
The fusion center gets the sum of values at every time interval and checks out whether the sum is greater 
than or equals the critical value, which is given by the length of queue LQ and the critical threshold of queue 
TQ. Let AD
q
AEF E(t) denote the final decision with queue at time step t, and the final decision function is defined as 
(4.12). Significantly, AD
q
AEFE(0) is defined to be 0.

AD
q
AEF E(t–1)  otherwise                                  
E (4.12) 
As shown in (4.12), the fusion center decides that the environment condition is event happening if AD
q
AEF
E(t−1) = 0 and AQ t  AEsumE is greater than or equals TQ×LQ; the environment condition is non-event if AD
q
AEF E(t–1) = 1 
and AQ t  AEsumE is smaller than or equals (1–TQ)×LQ, and the event is non-changed. Moreover, all the AQ
t[iE]A are reset 
to ‘1’ (‘0’) if AD
q
AEF E(t) = 1 (0). 
In addition, two critical thresholds TQ×LQ and (1–TQ)×LQ have the hysteresis phenomenon to 
decrease the probability of miss or false alarm when the environment statement has not been changed for a 
long time. Notably, the hysteresis phenomenon lets the WSN system become more stable and reliable. 
However, the decision queue scheme is difficult to get the optimal combination of TQ and LQ for different 
scenarios, and the scheme is also hard to analyze the error rate by mathematics. Therefore, this work proposed 
another scheme in the next section. 
16B4.3 The Saturation Counter Method 
This section introduces another final decision scheme, which uses a saturation counter to make the final 
decision more reliable. More details of the proposed schemes are described in the following. 
4.3.1 Making a Final Decision by a Counter 
The decision counter is set into the fusion center to accumulate pre-decisions. In the beginning of 
deployment, the counter value, which is denoted by CV(t), is set to ‘0’ for initialization. When the WSN has 
operated for monitoring, the CV(t) is added by one if DP(t) = 1. Oppositely, the CV(t) is subtracted by one if 
DP(t) = 0. However, the counter must have a limited size for operation. In other words, CV(t) cannot be 
negative or exceed the maximum counter value. When the counter is either full or empty, the addition or 
subtraction cannot be executed. Let θ denote the maximum counter value. Therefore, CV(t) is defined as 
(4.13).

ACV(t−1)A      otherwise                                   
EA (4.13) 
Let the final decision by the saturation counter at time interval t be denoted by AD
c
AEFE(t), and the final 
decision scheme in this work is defined as (4.14). Significantly, AD
c
AEF E(0) is defined to be 0 since the observed 
phenomenon is assumed that there is no event in the beginning of deployment.

E (4.14) 
As shown in (4.14), the fusion center determines whether the situation of environment is changing by 
two thresholds, θ and 0. At each time interval t, the fusion center decides that AD
c
AEF E(t) is changing to “1” if AD
c
AEF
E(t−1) = 0 and CV(t) hits the high threshold θ; the fusion center indicates that AD

= 1 and CV(t) reaches the low threshold 0. These two thresholds have a hysteresis characteristic so that CV(t)

Assume the number of deployed sensor nodes N is set to 10, and each sensor node can work for 105 time 
intervals average, which is MTI, depending on the power capacity. That is, if the total energy could be known 
and the length of time interval is decided, we can get the MTI by estimating. The threshold λ is set to 1 for 
likelihood ratio testing in all simulated conditions, and the value k is set to 5 in k-out-of-N rule. All the sensor 
nodes are considered working normally. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is set to 0dB, and the EC is set from 
0 to 50 times as the event change frequency which can be obtained by the statistic data. 
4.4.3 Result and Analysis of Decision Queue 
Each case of the decision queue scheme is iterated 1000 times to get the performance, and TQ is set from 
0.6 to 0.9. Figure 7 indicates the error rates with different TQ and LQ when EC=0. The interest is that LQ =1 
means using the k-out-of-N rule directly. Thus, using the decision queue scheme can get the lower error rate, 
and the performance is better than using the k-out-of-N rule only. Moreover, the greater LQ makes the lower 
error rate when EC=0. 
There is an interesting appearance: the curve in Figure 7 is like a saw. Because the TQ is a fraction, 
TQ×LQ or (1–TQ)×LQ in some cases have the same value even TQ is fixed. In other words, the threshold to 
decide the event change may be the same with the same TQ and different LQ. However, due to the simulation is 
no event change, the higher LQ makes the higher error penalty in the same TQ when the final decision is error. 
In other words, the final decision has to take some time intervals to change the decision from error because of 
the penalty. For an example, assume that the TQ is fixed to 0.8, and LQ is from 1 to 10. Event if the values 
TQ×LQ are the same when LQ are 4 and 5, or LQ are 9 and 10 individually, however, LQ in 5 (10) has higher 
penalty then LQ in 4 (9). Therefore, the error rate in LQ = 5 (10) has higher error rate then LQ = 4 (9). 
 
Figure 7 Performance of decision queue scheme when EC=0. 
Figure 8 and Figure 9 show EC = 20 and EC=50, respectively. When the EC becomes higher, the 
average error rate increases because of the time detection delay. However, the proposed decision scheme still 
make the error rate lower than using k-out-of-N rule only. 
 12 
 
Figure 10 The proposed mathematic method vs. the Monte Carlo simulation result about the relationship 
between θ and RError(θ) when EC=0. 
Moreover, Figure 11 and Figure 12 are shown the comparison between the proposed mathematic method 
and the Monte Carlo simulation result in the relationship θ and RError(θ) when EC=20 and 50 individually. The 
Monte Carlo is iterated 20 times, and the proposed mathematic method is very close to the Monte Carlo 
simulation results. The error rate in EC=50 is higher than the error rate in EC=20 apparently when θ is fixed. 
Figure 13 indicates that different event change number makes a different error rate when the maximum 
counter value is decided. Higher event frequency courses a higher error rate in a final decision. Obviously, θ = 
1 means the fusion center makes a final decision using k-out-of-N rule directly, therefore the error rate is 
higher than the proposed scheme. Moreover, if the detection delay is not so much important request for the 
application, the optimal counter size can be found directly by searching the minimum error rate.

between θ and RError(θ) when EC=20.

Figure 14 The proposed mathematic method vs. the Monte Carlo simulation result about the relationship 
between θ and τ(θ) when EC=20. 
The simulation using Monte Carlo method is shown in Figure 15, which is iterated 20 times, to show that 
the proposed analysis in mathematic method is very closed the real condition. The Monte Carlo method 
simulates the event change number is 50 in 105 time intervals. To find out the optimal θ, the minimum 
RError(θ)×τ(θ) settles on the θ is 4 depending on the proposed mathematic method. Therefore, if the statistic 
data shows the average event change number is 50 in 105 time intervals, setting the maximum counter value 
equals 4 can get the best performance.

between θ and RError(θ) × τ(θ) when EC=50. 
Therefore, we can get the error rate when the theta and event change number are given as shown in

work proposes a novel fusion scheme which uses a saturation counter to decreased affection of the noise in a 
final decision. The error rate is reduced efficiently by using the proposed scheme. However, the counter 
decision scheme causes the detection delay depending on the maximum counter value. To solve the trade-off, 
this work also finds the minimal RError(θ)×τ(θ) by illustrating the curve to optimize the maximum counter 
values for the different scenarios for application.

6B國科會補助專題研究計畫項下出席國際學術會議心得報告 
                                   日期：U 100U 年U 7 U月U 28 U 日 
                                 
一、參加會議經過 
這次到美國拉斯維加斯參加 the 2011 International Conference on Computer Design (CDES'11) 的會
議，會議的日期是從 7月 18日到 7月 21日，我被安排到的 session是 Discussion / Poster Session，時間
是安排在 18 號的下午。這次 WORLDCOMP 還有很多其他領域的會議同時召開，包含了 Embedded 
System and Applications、Parallel and Distributed Processing Techniques and Applications、Engineering of 
Reconfigurable System and Applications等等。在這邊看見了許多來自世界各地不同國家的學者，其中包
括了印度、巴基斯坦、日本、美國、中國等，也在我的 session遇到了在美攻讀學位的台灣留學生。在
我報告完後，也參與了其他議程，除了聽到一些有趣的研究，更發現來自不同國家的部分學者有著不
同風格的報告方式，如此生動活潑也令我大開眼界。另外也參加了這次 WORLDCOMP 大會舉辦的晚
宴，有著更多來自不同國度的面孔，甚至還遇到了來自輔仁大學的黃貞瑛教授，相談甚歡之餘也交換
了一些心得，受益良多。 
二、與會心得 
參加此國際研討會不但更加開拓了自己的國際視野，尤以拉斯維加斯是國際知名旅遊景點，因此也接
觸到了種種不同於台灣風情的多元異國文化。不僅讓我得到了許多寶貴的經驗，也是自己的人生經歷上留
下了一筆很珍貴的回憶。這次在國際研討會上發表自己的研究成果，讓我深深的體會到英語文能力的重要
性，首先要能聽懂別人提出的問題，然後要在短時間內構思出語彙來將你的想法以及成果簡單迅速又明確
地讓外國學者知道，是相當困難的。在臺灣報告時通常都還可以事先準備，但這次的行程不管是在會議中
還是出了會場後，一切都必須靠自己。用自己不甚熟悉的語言溝通，一方面訓練了口語能力，一方面也是
相當磨練膽量的。由於這是我第一次前往美國，且並非跟旅遊團而是用背包客的方式出國，事前準備除了
可以問實驗室學長姊跟老師提供的經驗以外全部都要自己來。這次在美國的行程不論是在文化衝擊或者是
語言溝通方面，都可以算是人生經歷中的一種突破吧。讓我更期待著往後的異國之旅。
