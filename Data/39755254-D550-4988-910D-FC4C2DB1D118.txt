英文摘要 
Magnetic properties of FePt/Pt bilayers are investigated. By introducing the Pt underlayer, 
coercivity Hc and ordering parameter S of the film are enhanced by about of 50%. Using our 
low-temperature annealing process (~400℃),  Hc is increased from 6.26 to 9.78 kOe and S is 
increased from 0.586 to 0.844. Theoretical calculations indicate that compressive stress exists in 
the FePt film. The stress was found to release with the increased thickness of the Pt underlayer. 
Evidence was observed from the measured crystallographic data of the FePt lattice. The increased 
lattice parameter aFePt and the decreased lattice parameter cFePt are closely related to the relaxed 
compressive stress in the FePt film as the thickness of Pt underlayer is increased. The relaxed 
compressive stress can account for the enhancement in the ordering parameter and the coercivity 
of the FePt/Pt bilayer materials.

interdiffusion between Pt and FePt films is negligible at the low annealing temperature of 400 ℃ 
in this study. Since the residual stress in the FePt film is found to strongly depend on the 
thickness of the Pt underlayer, we would like to explore how to modulate the ordering 
transformation of the FePt film. The relationship between crystallographic data (such as lattice 
parameters and unit cell volume) and magnetic properties (such as ordering parameter K and 
coercivity Hc, etc) will also be presented. 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
 
FePt/Pt bilayer samples were deposited on quartz substrates by rf sputtering at room 
temperature, followed by a post annealing at 400 oC for 1 hour. Background vacuum was less 
than 7×10-7 torr. Working pressure of Ar was fixed at constant value of 10 mtorr. The thickness of 
FePt magnetic film is fixed at 60 nm while the thickness of Pt underlayer is varied from 0 to 120 
nm. The FePt target was made by pasting Pt foils onto a Fe target with 2 inches diameter. 
 Crystal structure was studied with an x-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The 
ordering parameter is measured from the obtained lattice parameter data by c/a ratio method [21]. 
Magnetic properties were measured with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) under a 
maximum field 12 kOe along the in-plane direction. To obtain saturated magnetic properties, the 
samples were magnetized using a pulse field of 4 T before VSM measurements. Chemical 
compositions of the films were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Magnetic properties of the FePt/Pt bilayer samples are varied with the thickness of Pt 
underlayer, as indicated in Table 1. The data of the FePt thin film without Pt underlayer is also 
listed for comparison. Coercivity is increased from 6.26 kOe for a single-layer FePt to 9.53 kOe 
for the bilayer sample as the thickness of the Pt underlayer (tPt) is 120 nm. Compared with the 
single-layer FePt, the maximum enhancements in coercivity Hc and in energy product (BH)max for 
the bilayer samples are both about 50%. Both the coercivity Hc and the ordering parameter K 
appear to have the same dependence of underlayer thickness; both are increased with tPt. 
However, the remanent magnetization Br is decreased with tPt. The decreased Br is again 
attributed to the increased ordered phase which has less magnetization values. 
X-ray diffraction patterns of the FePt/ Pt bilayer samples with different tPt values are 
shown in Fig. 1. Both the disordered FePt phase (fcc structure) and the ordered FePt phase (fct 
structure) coexist in the diffraction patterns. The closest packing face of the face centered cubic 
structure is (111), so the highest intensity of FePt and Pt is (111) peak. Further increase in tPt 
makes the face centered cubic FePt (200) peak split into fct (200) and fct (002) peaks; and the fcc 
(220) peak splits into fct (220) and fct (202) peaks. The peak separation is an indication of the 
L10 ordering transformation. 
Lattice parameters of the ordered (fct) FePt and the fcc phase Pt, together with the 
theoretical value of Pt bulk (dash line) are plotted versus the thickness of the Pt underlayer tPt, as
