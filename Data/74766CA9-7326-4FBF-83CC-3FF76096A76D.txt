of cryptosystems, such as identity-based encryption, 
identity-based signature, broadcast encryption, 
public-key encryption with keyword search, short 
signature, group signature, ring signature, blind 
signature, partially blind signature, proxy 
encryption, and multi-signature. 
     It is crucial to choose suitable system 
parameters when using either elliptic curve 
cryptosystems or pairing-based cryptosystems. 
Nowadays, in order to generate pairing-friendly 
elliptic curve, the complex multiplication (CM) 
method is needed. It first specifies the order and 
the base field of the elliptic curve, and next the 
coefficients of the elliptic curve are calculated by 
using CM method. In the last year of this project, we 
analyzed the mathematical principles and the 
efficiency of CM method to find any improvement, and 
attempted to benefit the popularity of cryptosystems 
based on the elliptic curve or the bilinear pairing.

線上一點，Q 在 P所生成的子群中，則尋找一個整數 k使得 Q = kP 就是橢
圓曲線離散對數問題。橢圓曲線密碼系統的安全性就建立在橢圓曲線離散
對數問題。 
 
  根據美國國家技術標準學會(NIST)之建議，現在的安全強度要求至少
要同 RSA-2048。提高安全度的一種選擇是增加安全參數(更多位元數)的傳
統公開金鑰系統；另一種選擇則是採用橢圓曲線密碼系統。 
 
  評斷公開金鑰密碼系統所需要之金鑰長度的方法之ㄧ是將他們與傳
統加密演算法(即對稱式加密演算法－symmetric encryption algorithms，如
DES及 AES 演算法)做比較，下表列出 NIST 所建議之金鑰長度： 
 
Symmetric Key 
Size 
RSA and Diffie-Hellman 
Key Size 
Elliptic Curve Key Size  
Prime Field / Binary Field 
80 1024 192 / 163 
112 2048 224 / 233 
128 3072 256 / 283 
192 7680 384 / 409 
256 15360 521 / 571 
NIST 建議之金鑰長度(單位: bit) 
 
  以安全性來說，要達到與對稱式加密演算法一樣的安全度，橢圓曲線
需要長度為對稱式加密演算法兩倍長的金鑰。使用 RSA 或 Diffie-Hellman
密碼系統保護 128 位元 AES 密鑰，依上表所建議應使用 3072 位元之金鑰
－是目前在網際網路中所使用的三倍，而相對應的橢圓曲線密碼系統所需
使用的金鑰只要 256 位元。如此便可發現，在增加相同強度安全性下，RSA
與 Diffie-Hellman 金鑰長度增加的速度，比橢圓曲線密碼系統所需增加的
速度更為驚人。也就是說，橢圓曲線密碼系統每位元所提供之安全度比
RSA或 Diffie-Hellman 密碼系統更佳。 
 
  另外，安全度不是橢圓曲線密碼學唯一有吸引力的特點。橢圓曲線密

身分認證系統[KKK02]、其他應用及密碼系統[AL03, SD03]等。 
 
研究目的 
  在選擇橢圓曲線作為一個公開金鑰系統的基礎有許多安全上的考量。
NIST提供了一份安全的橢圓曲線列表，其中五條曲線是定義於二元體上
的 Koblitz 橢圓曲線，五條是定義於相同二元體上的隨機橢圓曲線，另五
條曲線是定義在質數體上的隨機橢圓曲線。這些橢圓曲線可保護相當於長
度為 80、112、128、192和 256 位元對稱式密碼算法的密鑰。 
 
  由於 NIST 建議，公開金鑰密碼系統需相當於 RSA-2048之安全度，可用短
金鑰之橢圓曲線密碼系統的協定標準化(ECDSA、ECMQV、ECIES 等)，所以未
來公開金鑰密碼系統之走向勢必為橢圓曲線密碼系統，因此，選擇安全並運算具
有一定效率的橢圓曲線，是建置一個實用的資訊安全系統的重要議題。 
  在公開金鑰密碼系統中，增加金鑰長度可以達到更高的安全等級，但
相對地，也要付出更久的運算時間。因此，選擇安全且高效率的橢圓曲線，
是建置實用資訊安全系統的重要議題。根據橢圓曲線密碼學的研究，一般
破解離散對數的方法中，最有效的是 Pohlig-Hellman 攻擊法，而專門針對
橢圓曲線離散對數問題的同構攻擊法(Isomorphism Attack)，包含 MOV 攻
擊、FR 攻擊法，及針對 prime-field-anomalous 曲線的攻擊法，以及 Weil 
Descent攻擊。綜合上述所有的攻擊法，我們要選擇一條定義在有限體上
適用的橢圓曲線，必須滿足以下條件： 
 
1. 橢圓曲線的點個數          ，其中 r 為至少 160-bit 長的質數 
2.           
3.        for          
4. 若     ，則 m為質數 
 
  因此，在橢圓曲線密碼系統的應用上，為了避免密碼系統被攻破，求
出有限體上橢圓曲線的有理點個數是很關鍵的，也就是點數計算問題(point 
counting problem)，如果用直觀的計算方式，如 Legendre 符號(Legendre 
6 
 
pairing-friendly橢圓曲線的策略，在這些學者所提出來的方法中，大致上
可分為兩種類型：一種是家族式的橢圓曲線(elliptic curves in families)，另
一種則是非家族式的橢圓曲線(elliptic curves not in families)。 
 
  在此簡短的介紹尋找 pairing-friendly橢圓曲線的演進，首先，由Miyaji，
Nakabayashi及Takano針對 k=3、4、6提出MNT 橢圓曲線，2004年Galbraith、
Mckee、Valenca 提出了散發的 Brezing-Weng 家族式橢圓曲線(sporadic 
families of Brezing-Weng curve)，2005 年 Brezing 及 Weng 提出 cyclotomic
家族橢圓曲線(cyclotomic families elliptic curve)，2006 年 Freeman 提出 
Freeman 家族橢圓曲線(Freeman’s families elliptic curve)。同年，Scott及
Barret 提出了 Scott-Barreto 家族橢圓曲線(Scott-Barreto families elliptic 
curve)。 
 
  如果要找非家族式的橢圓曲線，通常只要使用學者所提的方法，就可
以找到合適的橢圓曲線，但一般來說，這個方法能找到的曲線數量是很有
限的。因此，本計畫將著重家族式橢圓曲線，在這類的方法中，先用多項
式表示橢圓曲線參數，包含係數、定義的有限體等，然後可以代入不同的
x值，而得到不同的 pairing-friendly橢圓曲線，但是，通常使用目前學者
所提的方法，尚不能很快找到合適的橢圓曲線，因為通常在家族式橢圓曲
線的論文中，只是找到代表橢圓曲線的一組多項式，而並未提到該代入何
值使得這些多項式真正能代表一個合適的橢圓曲線。 
 
  在找尋到適合的橢圓曲線參數後，需要用 CM 演算法求得真正橢圓曲
線的係數 a 與 b，首先介紹，對於一個複數 τ，下列式子可以計算j τ ：

研究方法 
  在尋找 pairing-friendly橢圓曲線中，最重要的一步驟就是 Complex 
Multiplication 方法的計算，在本年度中，我們充分了解此方法的代數理論，
也了解此方法的相關改進，並試圖使用 Computer Science 背景，針對程式
設計部分做改良，以期能更有效率的產生適用於 pairing-based 密碼系統的
橢圓曲線。另一方面，我們也針對 pairing-based 密碼系統做一研究，了解
bilinear pairing 的原理與應用，並對現行多種 pairing-based 密碼系統之設計
做一了解，找出能將 pairing 更加推廣與應用的方法。

結論與建議 
 
  We state the mathematical backgrounds and describe each step of the 
complex complication method in this thesis. For computing the class 
polynomial is one of the major part of CM method, we focus on the 
computation of the class polynomial, present the experimental results, and ﬁnd 
some interesting differences between the prime and composite discriminants. It 
seems like that the computations of the Weber polynomials of composite 
discriminants have the chance to be more efﬁcient. To conﬁrm this effect, it 
should take more experiments and observe closely. 
 
  In our experiments, we compute the class polynomial of discriminants 
with at most 6 digits. Though the computation of class polynomial with more 
digits would take more time, there must exist more interesting properties to be 
discovered and may become the measurement of evaluating the discriminants. 
Lots of researches related to computing the class polynomial are proposed 
nowadays. Andrew V. Sutherland achieve the record of computing the class 
polynomial with discriminant D=4058817012071 and has class number

Chapter 3
Complex Multiplication for
Elliptic Curve
In this chapter, we outline the complex multiplication method (CM
method) first, and then describe each step in detail to show how it works.
3.1 Outline of the Complex Multiplication Method
First of all, by the property of the j-invariant of an elliptic curve over
finite field Fq, where Char pqq ą 3, if we know the j-invariant, we can
construct an elliptic curve with this j-invariant.
Let j be the j-invariant and the equation of elliptic curve E be de-
fined as
y2 “ x3 ` 3j
1728´ j x`
2j
1728´ j . (3.1)
Then elliptic curve E will be an elliptic curve with j pEq “ j.
Now we review the elliptic curves defined over C.
From Section 2.2.3, an elliptic curve EC defined over C is isomor-
phic to C{L, where L “ Zω1`Zω2, ω1, ω2 P C, and ω1, ω2 are linearly
independent in R. We can rewrite the lattice L as L “ Z`Zτ such that
the imaginary part of τ is positive, and we get j pECq “ j pτq.
Furthermore, the endomorphism ring of EC will be
End pECq » tβ P C|βL Ď Lu
22
According to the idea of the CM method, the algorithm of gener-
ating elliptic curves by CM method can be designed as below. Since
the Hilbert polynomials can be computed in advance, the algorithm
takes the Hilbert polynomials as input.
Algorithm : Construct elliptic curve using CM method
INPUT: A squarefree integer d ‰ 1, 3, parameters  and δ, Hilbert class polynomial HD pXq,
desired size of p and l.
OUTPUT: A prime p of the desired size, an elliptic curve E{Fp with l  #E pFpq, where l is
a large prime.

11. if Q “ 8 and n2P ‰ 8, return p and Ej
12. else if Q ‰ 8, return p and E 1j
3.2 Endomorphism Ring
In Section 2.1.3, we formulate some definitions related to homomor-
phism. For studying the details of the CM-method, we start from intro-
ducing the endomorphism ring of an elliptic curve.
Definition 3.2 (Endomorphism). Let A1 and A2 are abelian varieties
over K and HomK pA1,A2q denote the set of homomorphisms from
A1 to A2. Then the homomorphisms EndK pA1q :“ HomK pA1,A1q
are the endomorphisms of A1.
24

“ ´℘ pzq ,
℘1 pizq “ i℘1 pzq .
Hence, we have the corresponding endomorphism on the elliptic curve
E given by
i px, yq “ p´x, iyq
i.e. we get the the corresponding map of the endomorphism between E
and C{L
C{L : z ÞÑ iz
E pCq : px, yq “ p℘ pzq , ℘1 pzqq ÞÑ p℘ pizq , ℘1 pizqq “ p´x, iyq
It shows that given α “ a ` bi P Z ris and px, yq P E pCq, where
Z ris “ ta` bi|a, b P Zu, then α would be an endomorphism of E de-
fined by
px, yq ÞÑ pa` biq px, yq “ a pxq ` b p´x, iyq
since point multiplication by integer a and b can be expressed by ratio-
nal functions.
Therefore, in this cases,
Z ris Ď EndC pEq .
Figure 3.2 shows two examples of EndC pEq, one is multiplication
by integer and the other by i.
Now we deal with the endomorphism rings of the arbitrary elliptic
curve over C. We prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3.3. Let E be an elliptic curve defined over C and L be the
lattice such that E pCq » C{L. Then

Figure 3.3: The illustration of the morphisms proved of Theorem 3.3 -
(1)
Proof. Let E be an elliptic curve defined over C and L “ Zω1 ` Zω2
be the corresponding lattice. To prove the theorem, we need to show the
followings:
1. All endomorphisms of E pCq can be expressed by β such that
βL Ď L
2. All such β’s define endomorphisms of E pCq
Here we start the proof.
1. Given an endomorphism α of E pCq, by definition of the en-
domorphism, it maps a point P “ px, yq P E pCq to αP “
α px, yq P E pCq and can be expressed by rational functions
α px, yq “ pR pxq , yS pxqq .
Since there exists an isomorphism Φ between C{L and E pCq
Φ : C{L ÝÑ E pCq ,Φ pzq “ p℘ pzq , ℘1 pzqq ,
the map
α˜ “ Φ´1 pα pΦ pzqqq
would be an endomorphism of C{L. Figure 3.3 illustrates the
relations of these morphisms.
To show that α˜ pzq “ βz for some β P C, we focus on the action
of the endomorphism applying on a sufficiently small area U near
z “ 0. Then we obtain the map from U to C such that
α˜ pz1 ` z2q ” α˜ pz1q ` α˜ pz2q mod L, @z1, z2 P U

Figure 3.4: The illustration of the morphisms proved of Theorem 3.3 -
(2)
By proving the above, we link the endomorphism ring EndC pEq
and the lattice L corresponding to E pCq together.
Theorem 3.3 shows that the endomorphism ring of an elliptic curve
over C is related closely to the lattice it corresponds to. The next theo-
rem gives us a precise structure of the endomorphism ring, EndC pEq.
Theorem 3.4. LetE be an elliptic curve defined over C. ThenEndC pEq
is isomorphic either to Z or to an order in an imaginary quadratic field.
Proof. Let L “ Zω1 ` Zω2 be the lattice corresponding to E. By
Thoerem 3.3, let
R “ EndC pEq “ tβ P C|βL Ď Lu .
Then we have Z Ă R and R is a ring since R is closed under the com-
position laws ` and ˆ. Given β P R, for tω1, ω2u is a basis of lattice L,
then
βω1 “ jω1 ` kω2, βω2 “ mω1 ` nω2, j, k,m, n P Z
ùñ

“ 0.
So the determinant of the matrix is 0,
β2 ´ pj ` nq β ` pjn´ kmq “ 0.
Hence, β lies in some quadratic field K and β is an algebraic integer
(7 j, k,m, n P Z). We deal with field K in two cases.
30
By the Hasse theorem (Theorem 2.43), the unique integer t satisfies
|t| ď 2?q. It can be shown that if t “ ˘2?q, then the endomorphism
ring would be an order in a quaternion algebra. For our application and
in pratical, we restrict the discussion on the case that |t| ă 2?q. Since
|t| ă 2?q, the polynomial X2 ´ tX ` q “ 0 would have only complex
roots, therefore
Z ‰ Z rφqs Ď End pEq .
From Theorem 3.4, then the endomorphism ring of an elliptic curve
defined over finite field would be an order in an imaginary quadratic
field. Observing the polynomial
X2 ´ tX ` q “ 0,
the roots would lie in the imaginary quadratic field Q
´a
t2 ´ 4q
¯
.
Hence, for choosing the parameters t and q, we can then determine the
imaginary quadratic field K “ Q `?´d˘ such that
End pEq Ď OK .
This is an important result that allows us to choose the desired order
first and then find the elliptic curve with the exactly order.
In this section, we link the relation of the order of an elliptic curve
and the structure of its endomorphism ring. Following we show how to
use the structure to find the desired elliptic curve.
3.3 Ideal Class Group
We have showed that the endormorphism ring of an elliptic curve is iso-
morphic to Z or to an order in an imaginary quadratic field in previous
section. It can be proved that for an ordinary elliptic curve E defined
over Fp, the endomorphism ring End pEq is an order in an imaginary
quadratic field. To connect the endomorphism ring and the j-invariant
of an elliptic curve together, we introduce the ideal class group in this
section.
Definition 3.5. Let R be a ring, I is an ideal of R if it is a nonempty
subset of R such that
32
From the definition, for a fractional idealM ofR, we have αM Ď R
and αM is an integral ideal of R for some nonzero α P R. Hence for
any fractional ideal of R, it can be expressed in the form α´1I , where I
is an integral ideal of R.
Now we state the following lemma:
Lemma 3.8 (Group of fractional ideals). If R is a Dedekind ring, then
the set of all fractional ideals forms a multiplicative abelian group, de-
noted by F pRq. The set P pRq consisting of all principal fractional
ideals of R is a subgroup of F pRq.
Then we can define the class group of an integral ring R.
Definition 3.9 (Class group). Let R be a Dedekind ring. Then the quo-
tient group F pRq {P pRq is called the class group of R, denoted by CR.
When R “ OK , we write CK .
We say that two fractional ideals are equivalent if they belong to the
same coset of P pRq in F pRq. In other words, fractional ideals I, J are
equivalent, denoted by I „ J , provided that ψ pIq “ ψ pJq under the
natural map ψ : F pRq ÞÑ F pRq {P pRq.
The cardinality of the class group |CK | is called the class number of
OK , denoted by hK . It can be proved that hK is finite.
In our case, for an elliptic curve E, the endomorphism ring End pEq

, hD is the Hilbert
class number, τi are the representatives of the elements of the class
group of OK , and j pτiq are the j-invariants of corresponding τi value.
By Theorem ??, for an elliptic curve E over C, there is a lattice Lτ
such that E pCq » C{Lτ and j pEq “ j pLτ q “ j pτq. Therefore, the j-
invariants in above polynomial would be the j-invariants of the elliptic
curve corresponding to τi. Since we have showed that j-function is a
function that maps the fundamental domain F to entire complex plane,
we can focus on the τ ’s in F for computing the Hilbert polynomial.
3.5 Hilbert Polynomial
To connect the elliptic curves over number fields and elliptic curves over
finite field, we discuss the properties of Hilbert polynomial.
According to Theorem 3.10, restate the description of Hilbert poly-
nomial first:
Corollary 3.11. Let K “ Q `?´d˘ be an imaginary quadratic field
with ring of integers OK . Let E be an elliptic curve with EndC pEq “
OK . Then the minimal polynomial of jE is the Hilbert class polynomial
HD pxq “
hDź
r“1
px´ j pτiqq ,
where j pτiq is the j-invariant of the elliptic curve corresponding to τi,
hD is the Hilbert class number, and τi are representatives of the elements
of the class group of OK .
We know that for a j-invariant j pτq, the minimal polynomial of
j pτq is the Hilbert polynomial. Since it can be proved that j-invariant
is an algebraic integer, the Hilbert polynomial has integer coefficients.
Therefore, by taking all the integer coefficients modulo a prime p, the Hilbert
polynomial can be reduced to a polynomial HD pxqp over Fp.
HD pxqp “
hDź
r“1
px´ j pτiqq (mod p)
“ xhD ` ahD´1xhD´1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ` a1x` a0,
38
On the other hand, the conditions of the redeuced binary quadratic
form make the corresponding τ belonging to the fundamental domain
F . Given a τi, one can compute j pτiq by following
Definition 3.13 (Dedekind’s η-function). Let τ be a complex number
with positive imaginary part, i.e. τ P H, define q “ e2piiτ and the
η-function by
η pτq “ q 124

¸24
The j pτq is related to ∆ pτq by
h pτq “ ∆ p2τq
∆ pτq , j pτq “
p256h pτq ` 1q3
h pτq .
Since the computations are over C, the results would be the approx-
imate value for j pτiq. By the fact that the coefficients of the Hilbert
polynomial are all integers, we can obtain the actual polynomial by us-
ing sufficient precision.
3.6 Weber Polynomial
Since the coefficients of the Hilbert polynomial grow fast when the de-
gree of the polynomial increases, the computation of the Hilbert poly-
nomial was suggested to be taken in advance. Another solution is to
use other class invariant instead of j-invariant. Different class invariant
leads different class polynomial. The Weber polynomial is used most.
The Weber functions are defined as following, using the Dedekind’s η-
function (see Definition 3.13),
f pτq “ ζ´148

3.7 Finding Roots of Polynomial over Fp
After computing the Hilbert polynomial, next we want to find a root jp
in the finite field Fp to construct the corresponding elliptic curve. Before
finding a root of the Hilbert polynomial modulo p, some criteria need to
be satisfied when choosing the prime field p.
Assume the prime number p is decomposed in Q
`?´d˘, by the
class field theory of imaginary quadratic fields, we have following the-
orem.
Theorem 3.14. There is an integer pi P Q `?´d˘ such that pipi “ p and
|p` 1´ ppi ` piq| equals to #E pFpq or its twists.
From the theorem above, we have pipi “ p and pi ` pi “ #E pFpq ´
pp` 1q “ t, then the minimal polynomial of pi would be
x2 ´ tx` p.
Recall the characteristic polynomial of Frobenius map φp
φ2p ´ tφp ` p,
where t is called the Frobenius trace. We can observe that in Theorem
3.14, the algebraic integer pi is actually the Frobenius endomorphism
acting on Ep or its twist modulo p.
Hence, we need to choose pwhich can be decomposed inOK . These
primes would be the ones such that there are integer solutions to the
norm equation
x2 ` dy2 “ p, where  “
#
1 if d ” 1, 2 (mod 4)
4 if d ” 3 (mod 4) .
From the equation above, we obtain that ´d must be a square modulo
p. To find such a suitable prime p, one usually uses the Cornacchia’s
algorithm to get a solution.
Algorithm : Cornacchia’s algorithm
42
where fi pxq is the product of irreducible polynomials with degree i. For
each fi pxq, applying the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm to find individ-
ual factors. The Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm can factor the polynomial
with all irreducible factors having the same degree.
Focus on finding roots of reduced Hilbert polynomial modulo p,
since deg
´
HD pxqp
¯
ă p, reducing the square part can be done by
computing HDpxqp
gcdpHDpxqp,H 1Dpxqpq . For the roots we interest are those lie in
ground field Fp, we only process the polynomial f1 pxq, i.e. the product
of the irreducible polynomials with degree 1.
We also can use the fact that g pxq “ xp ´ x is the product of all
irreducible polynomial of degree 1 in Fp. The polynomial f1 pxq then
can be obtained by computing
f1 pxq “ gcd
´
HD pxqp , g pxq
¯
.
Finally, using the Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm to find the roots in Fp.
Algorithm : Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm
INPUT: A polynomial f pxq with all irreducible factors having the same degree. Assume
deg pf pxqq “ n.
OUTPUT: All the factors of f pxq.
1. repeat
2. select a random polynomial r pxq with degree less than n
3. if gcd pr pxq , f pxqq ‰ 1, then return r pxq
4. compute s pxq “ r pxqpp´1q{2 (mod f pxq)
5. then gcd ps pxq ` 1, f pxqq is a factor with probability 1´ 2´pn´1q
6. until factor f pxq successful
3.8 Twist Curves
After finding the roots of the Hilbert polynomial (or transforming the
roots of the Weber polynomial) in the finite field Fp, we can compute
44
• If AB ‰ 0, then for every v P K˚ the curve E is isomorphic to
E˜v : y
2 “ x3`A1x`B1 with A1 “ v2A, B1 “ v3B over K `?v˘ .
The curves occuring in the Corollary above are called twist of E. In
the last case, the curves E˜v are called quadratic twists of E. Note that
E is isomorphic to E˜v over K if and only if v is a square in K˚.
In Corollary 3.16, by taking v P K˚ a quadratic nonresidue, one can
define the quadratic twist of E as
E˜v : vy
2 “ x3 ` Ax`B
by dividing by v3 and transforming y ÞÑ y{v and x ÞÑ x{v. Then it can
be seen that both E and E˜v contain exactly two points px, yiq for each
x P Fp. Hence we have the following proposition.
Proposition 3.17. Let E be a curve defined over Fp and let E˜ be the
quadratic twist of E. Then
#E pFpq `#E˜ pFpq “ 2p` 2.
Hence, if #E pFpq “ p`1´t then #E˜ pFpq “ p`1`t. Therefore, if
the order of the curve we get from the algorithm is not the one we want,
then find a quadratic nonresidue v and the twist curve by v would be the
actual curve with desired order.

2. Related Works
In this section, we provide cryptographic background
of elliptic curves and bilinear pairings, followed by an
introduction of searchable encryptions and attribute-based
encryptions, which is relevant to our proposed scheme.
2.1 Elliptic Curve and Bilinear Pairing
An elliptic curve [31] is the set of all points (x, y)
satisfying the equation of the form y2 = x3+ax+b together
with an extra point called point at infinity. In cryptography,
we usually consider elliptic curves over one finite field Fq
where each coordinate of the point (x, y) is a member of
Fq . The set of points on the elliptic curve forms an Abelian
group under a certain addition rule where the point at infinity
serves as the identity of this group.
Bilinear pairings [32], [33] are critical building blocks that
enable identity-based cryptography and its variants. Let G1
be a cyclic additive group generated by P , whose order is
a prime p, and G2 be a cyclic multiplicative group of the
same order p. A bilinear pairing is a map eˆ : G1 × G1 →
G2 with the following properties: (1) Bilinear: ∀P,Q ∈ G1,
∀a, b ∈ F∗q , eˆ(aP, bQ) = eˆ(aP, bQ)ab, (2) Non-degenerate:
∀P,Q 6= 0G1 , eˆ(P,Q) 6= 1G2 , and (3) Computable: eˆ(P,Q)
is efficiently computable.
2.2 Attribute-based Encryption
Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) provides a fine-grained
access control of shared data. ABE was originated from
the work by Sahai and Waters [10]. Later, two tracks of
ABE have been developed: ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE)
[13], [15] and key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) [12], [14]. In
the CP-ABE scheme, the user is granted attribute keys
(associated with attributes), and the access policy could be
enforced on the ciphertext. If the user owns the attribute
keys satisfying the specified access policy, the user could
decrypt the message. A reverse setting is called KP-ABE,
which specifies decryption policy on the attribute keys and
the ciphertext is tagged with a set of attributes.
However, to deploy in practical applications, managing
dynamic access policy is required to support ever-changing
access group. The attribute keys should be re-issued and
ciphertext be re-encrypted to comply with the current access
control policy. In addition, user revocation should be carried
out in an efficient way to control the damages. Some ABE
suggested that the expiration time is appended with the
attribute when generating associated attribute keys [13], [17].
However, the trade-off between the granularity of "window
of vulnerability" and the burden to update the attribute keys
should be considered. Boldyreva et al. [16] proposed an
efficient revocation scheme for IBE and KP-ABE, while
Yu et al. [18] proposed an ABE scheme with attribute
revocation. They integrated the proxy re-encryption (PRE)
with ABE, and enabled the authority to delegate most of the
work for key update of the user to proxy servers. Because
role-based access control (RBAC) [34] is commonly used
to restricting system access to authorized users. CP-ABE,
which is closely related to RBAC, is chosen as a building
block of our scheme for enterprise application scenario.
2.3 Searchable Encryption
Searchable encryption enables users to hide the search-
able keywords (of a file) by encryption. Later, users could
generate appropriate tokens/trapdoors for specific keywords
to retrieve the encrypted data containing these keywords.
Song et al. [19] first introduced the concept of searching
on encrypted data and provided practical solutions. Goh
[20] then formalized the notion of security for this problem
and constructed a more efficient scheme using Bloom filter.
Following that, some research [22], [23] has been conducted
to either improve the efficiency or provide stronger security
of searchable encryption. One commonality of these works
is that they all supported only single keyword search in the
symmetric key setting.
The concept of conjunctive keyword search in symmetric
key setting was first introduced by Golle et al. [25]. They
provided a security notion for conjunctive keyword search
over encrypted data and constructed a more efficient scheme
compared with the one trivially extended from single key-
word search scheme. Later, Ballard et al. [26] improved
by shortening the trapdoor size and reducing computa-
tion/storage overhead. However, due to the symmetric key
setting, these schemes only enable one user to store and
retrieve his/her own private data. Sharing of index building
and searching capability cannot be achieved easily.
Boneh et al. [21] first addressed one kind of practical
applications called email routing system. The searchable
index of a mail can be generated by using the recipient’s
public key. The recipient can retrieve particular emails
from the routing server by delegating related trapdoors. The
corresponding emails can be collected. In addition, Boneh et
al. [35] proposed another application called searching over
audit log, where the company can delegate specific trapdoor
to the auditor to inspect only audit-related records. However,
these schemes supported only single keyword search. There
are other applications requiring more expressive search over
possible keywords.
To enrich search expressions, Park et al. [27] pro-
posed public-key encryption with conjunctive keyword search
(PECK). Boneh et al. [36] further provided a scheme
supporting the conjunction of subset and range queries on
encrypted data. Their construction used the bilinear group
of composite order, which yields less efficient construction.
In addition, they considered only single-user setting, where
sharing of searchable index is hard to achieve. Hwang et al.
[28] provided one efficient PECK and considered a possible
extension to multi-user settings [29], [30]. In this paper, we
will further consider the sharing of searchable index should
be provided to enable group collaboration.
Enc(M,AS, PK) Denote AS as
∧
i˜∈I i˜. Assume M ∈ G2
and pick a random values s ∈ Z∗p . Compute CT =
(ver,AS, C˜, Cˆ, {Ci}i∈U ), where C˜ = MY s, Cˆ = sP . For
each i ∈ I, Ci = sTi, if i˜ = +i, Ci = sTn+1, if i˜ = −i,
and otherwise Ci = sT2n+i.
KeyGen(MK,S) Pick a random ri ∈ Z∗p for each i ∈ U .
Set r =
∑n
i=1 ri. Compute user attribute key as AK =
(ver, S,D, D¯ = {Di, Fi}i∈U ), where ver is the current
version number, D = (y− r)P , and U is attribute universe.
For each i ∈ U , Fi = rit2n+iP ; if i ∈ S,Di = riti P , and
otherwise Di = ritn+iP .
Decrypt(CT, PK, SK) If any two of CT , PK, and
SK have different ver, return ⊥. Otherwise, proceed
as follows: Suppose CT = {ver,AS, C˜, Cˆ, {Ci}i∈U},
SK = {ver, S,D, D¯ = {Di, Fi}i∈U}, and parse AS
as AS =
∧
i˜∈I i˜. For each i ∈ I , (1) if i˜ = +i
and i 6∈ S, compute ê(Ci, Di) = ê(stiP, ritiQ ). (2) if
i˜ = −i and i 6∈ S, ê(Ci, Di) = ê(stn+iP, ritn+iP ). If
i˜ 6∈ I , ê(Ci, Di) = ê(st2n+iP, rit2n+iP ). Thus, M =
C¯/(ê(Cˆ, Dˆ)
∏n
i=1 ê(P, P )
ris).
ReKeyGen(γ,MK) Denote the attribute set for update as
γ. Each i ∈ γ is defined within the range of [1, 2n],
the corresponding proxy re-key is generated as follows.
Randomly select t′i ∈ Z∗p and compute rki = t
′
i
ti
. For
each i ∈ {1, . . . , 2n}\γ, rk = 1. Output proxy re-key
as rk = (ver, {rki}1≤i≤2n), where ver is current version
which is the ver in MK plus one.
ReKey(D¯, rk, θ) Denote the attribute set as θ, where the
corresponding rekey is not 1. Each attribute ∈ θ is defined
within the range of [1, 2n]. If D¯ and rk have different ver,
return ⊥. Otherwise, update D¯ as follow. For each i ∈ θ,
D′i = rk
−1
i Di, if 1 ≤ i ≤ n, or D′i−n = rk−1i Di−n if
n < i ≤ 2n. For each i ∈ U , D′i = Di if i 6∈ θ and
i+ n 6∈ θ. D¯′ = {D′i, Fi}i∈U . ver is incremented by one in
corresponding secret key SK.
ReEnc(CT, rk, β) Denote the access structure of CT as
AS =
∧
i˜∈I i˜. Denote the attribute set in AS as β. Each
i ∈ β is defined within the range of [1, 2n]. If CT and rk
contain different version number, use input CT as output.
Otherwise, re-encrypt CT as follows. For each i ∈ β,
C ′i = rkiCi, if 1 ≤ i ≤ n, or C ′i−n = rkiCi−n if
n < i ≤ 2n. For each i ∈ U , C ′i = Ci if i 6∈ β and i+n 6∈ β,
or i 6∈ I . Output CT ′ = (ver + 1, AS, C˜, Cˆ, {C ′i}i∈U ).
3.4 Building Blocks - muPECS
Public-key conjunctive keyword search with multi-user
setting denoted as muPECKS [28] consists of four algo-
rithms: KeyGen, mPECK, Trapdoor, and Test. In this scheme,
each group can support up to m users, which is decided at
Setup phase. Each group member is given a public/private
key pair: the public key is used to produce (conjunctive)
searchable indexes, while the private key is applied to
generate valid trapdoors. The storage performs Test using
the trapdoor provided and the searchable indexes stored. If
the equality holds, the corresponding file is qualified.
Setup(1λ) Set param = (G1, G2, eˆ, H1(·), H2(·), P ), where
H1, H2: {0, 1}∗ −→ G1 are different collision-resistance
hash functions. Set the maximum size of a group as m.
Generate x1, . . . , xm ∈ Z∗p and compute yi = xiP . Send
the public/private key pairs (xi, yi) to user i securely.
mPECK(pk1, . . . , pkm,W ) Pick keyword set W = {w1,
. . . , wl} for the file M . Pick two random values s, r
∈ Z∗p and compute A = rP,Bj = syj , for 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
Ci = rUi + sVi, for 1 ≤ i ≤ l, where Ui = H1(wi) and
Vi = H2(wi). Output S = 〈A,B1, . . . , Bm, C1, . . . , Cl〉.
Trapdoor(skj , Q) Set Tj,Q1 = tP, Tj,Q2 = t
∑m′
i=1(UIi),
where t ∈ Z∗p , Tj,Q3 = txj
∑m′
i=1(VIi), where Q =
{I1, . . . Im, wI1 , . . . , wIm}. The trapdoor Tj,Q = (Tj,Q1 ,
Tj,Q2 , Tj,Q3 , I1, . . . Im).
Test(pkj , S, TQ) Include the file to the qualified file set QF
if eˆ(Tj,Q1 ,
∑m′
i=1(CIi) = eˆ(A, Tj,Q2)·eˆ(Bj , Tj,Q3).
4. Proposed Scheme
In this section, we propose one novel cloud storage con-
struction enabling the management of searchable dynamic
data for dynamic group collaboration. We make use of the
ABE and PECK detailed in Section 3.3 and Section 3.4
respectively. We also provide one practical example to
demonstrate how our construction enables dynamic group
collaboration by providing search-based retrieval and fine-
grained access control of dynamic data for enterprises.
4.1 Detailed Construction
Our scheme consists of ten operations: Setup, GrpCre-
ate, GrpStore, Retrieve, Search, GrpDecryt, UpdateAK,
UpdateCT, UpdateAU, and UpdateSI. The subscript in
each operation denotes its initiator: s is for CSP, c is for
CSC, and t is for TA. (See Fig. 2)
Setupt(1λ): 〈(PK,MK)〉 ← ABEar.Setup (iλ), param
← muPECK.Setup(1λ).
GrpCreatet(MK,S): AK ← ABEar.KeyGen(MK, S).
CSP sends AK to qualified CSC.
GrpStorec(M,AS, pk1, . . . , pkn,W ): CT ← ABEar.
Enc(M,AS, PK), S ← muPECK.mPECK(pk1, . . . ,
pkn,W ). CSC sends CT to CSP.
Retrievec(skj , Q): Tj,Q ← muPECK.Trapdoor(skj , Q).
CSC sends Tj,Q to CSP.
Searchs(pkj , S, TQ): QF ← mPECK.Test(pkj , S, TQ).
CSP sends QF back to CSC.
GrpDecrytc(QF , SK): For each encrypted file CT in QF ,
M = ABEar.Decrypt(CT, PK, SK).

GrpDecrypt (m+ 1) Pairing, m MulG2
UpdateAU 1 ExpG2
UpdateSI 1 AddG1 , 2 HashToPoint
5.1 Security Analysis
The security of our protocol is based on the underlying
ABEar [18] and muPECK [28]. On the one hand, the
ABEar is proved to be semantically secure under selective-id
chosen plaintext attack (IND-sID-CPA) assuming decisional
bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) is hard. Based on these
formal arguments, we can conclude that the unauthorized
entity (either CSC or CSP) cannot forge searchable indexes
and searchable trapdoors since these actions are involved in
solving the hard problem.
On the other hand, the muPECK is proved to be se-
mantically secure under multi-user ciphertext from random
against chosen keyword attacks (IND-mCR-CKA) assuming
decision linear Diffie-Hellman (DLDH) is hard. Therefore,
the unauthorized entity cannot calculate attribute keys for
decryption, either because these actions are involved in
solving the DLDH hard problem.
As for data dynamics, the data is re-encrypted to the same
ciphertext space. The re-generated key is also distributed
uniformly in the key space. Any adversary cannot gain
any more advantages since he/she has to deal with the
same hard problems as the ones before data/key update. In
addition, the user dynamics is handled by adding/removing
one part of searchable index of that user and issuing/updating
the attribute keys of that group. The secrecy of the data
encrypted under specified access policy can be guaranteed
when group members join or leave, while the access control
of search capability of group members can be assured.
5.2 Performance Analysis
We analyze local computation, storage, and communica-
tion cost for the CSC. Suppose that our scheme supports
maximum n users. To add data with l keywords and for
m′ authorized users, the CSC uses muPECK.mPECK to
generate indexes and ABEar.Enc to produce ciphertext. (n+
m′ + 2l + 2) scalar multiplication in G1 (SclrMulG1),
(l − 1) addition in G1 (AddG1) and 2l Hash are required
to prepare the data stored in the cloud, where n is the
maximum number of attribute supported. To retrieve data,
Retrieve costs 3 SclrMulG1 and (2m′ − 1) AddG1 , while
to decrypt the data, m + 1 Pairing and m multiplication
in G2 (MulG2) are needed. As for key update, the CSC
is required to send its old keys to exchange for updated
ones. UpdateAS uses 1 scalar multiplication in G1 for
Table 3: Experimental Benchmark
Basic Operation Operation Description Time
MulG2 multiplication in G2 1 µs
AddG1 addition in G1 9 µs
ExpG2 exponentiation in G2 0.22 ms
Pairing bilinear pairing 1.79 ms
SclrMulG1 scaler multiplication in G1 2.24 ms
HashToPoint hash to element in G1 5 ms
one authorized user, while UpdateSI depends on 2 Hash
and 1 addition in G1 for the inclusion/exclusion of one
single searchable index. Please refer to Table. 2. As for
communication cost, the CSC has to initiate a request for
GrpStore, Retrieve, UpdateAK, UpdateCT, UpdateAU,
and UpdateSI. Then the CSC receives the response from
the CSP. Only one round of communication is required.
The experimental benchmark is conducted using local
server with Intel Xeon processor E5620 at 2.40 GHz running
Ubuntu 11.10. We use GNU multiple precision arithmetic
library (GMP) [37] and pairing-based cryptography library
(PBC) [38] libraries. We select one supersingular curve over
one base field of size 512 bits and the embedding degree
is 2. Thus the security level is set to be ECC-160 bits. The
size of one group element in G1 is 1024 bits. The cost of
one addition in G1 costs 9 µs, while one multiplication in
G1 requires 2.24 ms. One multiplication in G2 requires 1
µs, while one exponentiation in G2 costs 0.22 ms. Finally,
the bilinear pairing needs 1.79 ms, and hash to G1 element
consumes 5.00 ms. (See Table 3)
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel cloud storage construc-
tion enabling the management of searchable dynamic data
for group collaboration. Our contributions are summarized
in the following three major features of our protocol: (1)
Explicitly addressing enterprise application scenario of cloud
storages in terms of system architecture and functionality.
(2) A novel access-control scheme for the enterprise users to
share the dynamic data and collaborate as a group, and (3) A
cost-effective design in terms of the enterprise user’s storage,
computation and communication while (2) is achieved. For
the future work, we would like to further integrate other
important functionalities for the enterprise such as public
auditing and secure cloud data computation, to enable a full-
fledged cloud storage for future enterprise applications.

Abstract—In this paper we propose a novel pixel-wise fragile
watermarking scheme which is able to detect tampered pixels
with very high probability. Based on a new technique called
Image-Dependent Seed (IDS), the proposed method is not
only efﬁcient but also secure against many known attacks.
Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be simply implemented
with only bit-wise AND and Exclusive-OR operations.
Keywords-pixel-wise fragile watermarking, image authenti-
cation, tamper detection.
I. INTRODUCTION
Multimedia information are spreading rapidly in the
world via the internet. In order to protect the copyright
of multimedia information, one can resort to watermarking.
In general, some common characteristics of watermarking
techniques are required as follows: perceptibility, robustness,
data capacity, security, sensitivity, oblivious extraction and
identiﬁcation. We refer the readers to [5], [6] for more
details. For purpose of perceptibility [4], watermarking has
two approaches: visible and invisible ones. An invisible
watermarking can preserve higher visual quality of original
images than a visible one. Robustness is another important
topic in the watermarking design. It can be classiﬁed into
three classes: robust, semi-fragile, and fragile watermarks.
Among them, the goal of fragile watermarking schemes is
to detect the tampered area of the watermarked images.
A block-wise image tamper detection only allows users to
determine which block contains the tampered pixel. In order
to localize the tampered pixel more precisely, the notion of
pixel-wise watermarks are also considered.
In [1], [2], pixel-wise watermarking schemes are proposed
which can localize the tampered pixel precisely. The pixel-
wise watermarking scheme of [1] can only detect whether
the least signiﬁcant bit of each pixed (LSB) is tampered
with or not. In [1], the proposed method is to replace the
least signiﬁcant bit of the host image by a pseudorandom
binary image obtained by short secret keys. In order to
protect more bits in each pixel of the watermarked images,
Shivani et al. proposed another pixel-wise scheme called
ARA (Authentication Relational & Associative) scheme [2].
The authors in [2] put three special bits into each pixel of
the watermarked image described as follows. In each pixel,
an Associative bit is constructed from the information of
the location of the original pixel and is put on the ﬁrst LSB
of the new pixel. Next, a Relational bit is built from the
most signiﬁcant bits of the original pixel and is put on the
second LSB of the new pixel. Finally, an Authentication
bit is computed from a pseudoraondom generator and is
put on the third LSB of the new pixel. Their scheme can
detect tampered pixel of watermarked images. However,
their scheme is not secure against the so-called transplanting
attack and the PSNR values of watermarked images are
about 40 dB.
In this paper, we purpose an efﬁcient pixel-wise fragile
watermarking scheme with better security and visual quality.
We develop a new technique called image-dependent seed
(IDS) and use it to design our watermarking scheme. The
experimental results show that our scheme is able to prevent
many known attacks including transplanting attack while
having good visual quality which is about 51 dB.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section III, the
purposed scheme is described there. In Section IV, we
give our experimental results and discuss its efﬁciency and
security. Finally, a conclusion is given in Section V.
II. PRELIMINARIES
Given a positive integers n. Let [n] denote the set
{1, 2, . . . , n}. Given a gray scale host m×n image I , let N
be the number of pixels, that is N = m× n. Let Pi denote
the pixel 8-bit value for the i-th pixel and b(Pi, j) denote
the j-th bit of Pi. Precisely, b(Pi, j) is deﬁned as follows.
b(Pi, j) = b Pi
2j−1
c mod 2. (1)
for j ∈ [8]. On the other hand, the original Pi can be
recovered from b(Pi, j)’s by the following equation.
Pi =
8∑
j=1
b(Pi, j)× 2j−1. (2)
Given an n-bit string x and 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let MSB≤i(x)
denote the ﬁrst i most signiﬁcant bits of x. Given two n-bit
strings x = (x1, . . . , xn) and y = (y1, . . . , yn), we deﬁne

A. Daub attack
In Figure 4(a), a tampered image is produced by inserting
a counterfeit signature. Adversaries may counterfeit the
signatures in the watermarked images in order to mimic real
signatures. In Figure 4(b), tamper-detection image is shown.
B. Content Replace attack
As in Figure 5(a), a tampered image generated by in-
serting a ﬂower on Lena’s hat into the watermarked image.
As one can see in Figure 5(b), the tampered region can be
detected even if it is irregular shape.
C. Vector Quantization attack
Our scheme is also against the well-known vector
quantization attack proposed in [3] which allows the at-
tacker to forge the watermark without knowing the secret

key. A vector-quantization attacker may select some non-
overlapping blocks of the watermarked image. Then attacker
uses these blocks to replace some part of the watermarked
image. In Figure 6(a), the watermarked image is suffered
from a vector quantization attack. The tamper-detection
result is shown in Figure 6(b).

D. Transplanting attack
Transplanting attacks are discussed here. Some pixel-
based or block-based watermark schemes use the secret
key to permutate the blocks or pixels of the given image.
Thus the randomized permutation only depends on the secret
keys. It may be the case that the attacker collects many
watermarked images which are obtained by using the same
