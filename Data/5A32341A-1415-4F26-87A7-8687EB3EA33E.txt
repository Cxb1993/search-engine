I. introduction 
Electrowetting is induced by changing the liquid–solid interfacial energy when a potential difference is 
applied to the dielectric layer between a liquid and an electrode. This usually leads to a reduction in the 
contact angle, and enhances the wetting behavior of the liquid [1-6]. For the transportation and manipulation 
of aqueous solutions, electrowetting has shown many advantages [7, 8]. Because it does not involve any 
mechanically moving components, mechanical fatigue is avoided and damage to the material being 
transported is reduced. For instance, Fowler et al. [9] applied electrowetting to enhance the mixing efficiency 
of liquid droplets containing red blood cells and globular protein. In addition, the power consumption of 
electrowetting-based devices is zero at rest and very low in movement [10]. It is also easily integrated into 
microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) for the transportation and mixing of liquids, in the use of devices 
such as micro-lenses, micro-mixers, biological micro-arrays, and micro-motors [11-18]. 
A key challenge for all biofluidic chips, including those operated by electrowetting-on-dielectric 
(EWOD), is the prevention of the nonspecific adsorption of biomolecules. Yoon and Garrell [19] proposed 
methods to minimize biomolecular adsorption in EWOD-based fluid actuation within air-filled channels. By 
selecting the pH of the solution and the square wave parameters, they determined that biomolecular 
adsorption on hydrophobic surfaces can be minimized or eliminated. They also indentified two mechanisms 
for biomolecular adsorption under EWOD conditions: passive adsorption arising from hydrophobic 
interaction and electrostatically driven adsorption when an external electric field is applied. 
The arrival of protein at the interface is assumed to be driven solely by diffusion processes, which are 
dependent on bulk concentration and the coefficient of diffusion [20]. Adsorption of protein on hydrophobic 
surfaces tends to be very strong and often partially irreversible. Adsorption on charged surfaces tends to be a 
function of the charge character of the protein, the pH of the medium and ionic strength [21]. Quinn et al. [22] 
proposed that the ionic strength of a solution can influence electrowetting behavior, namely greater ionic 
strength increases the response to electrowetting. In milk, electrical conductivity (EC) is determined by the 
concentration of anions and cations, which is obviously related to ionic strength. The most important ions in 
milk are Na+, K+, and Cl- [23, 24]. Typical EC of normal milk appears to be between 4.0 and 5.5 mS/cm at 
25oC [25]. The somatic cell count (SCC) of milk indicates the level of both epithelial cells and white blood 
cells per milliliter of milk. With an infection or inflammation of the cow’s udder the white blood cell level 
 3
voltage was applied to the droplet and a positive voltage to the layer beneath. 
The raw milk in the foremilk of dairy cows was sampled from a herd of Holsteins in Taiwan. The 
collected samples were based on ‘cow-side’ or ‘on-site’ portable detectors to measure the electrical 
conductivity (EC) of the milk. The samples were stored at 4oC, transported to the laboratory on ice, and tested 
upon arrival. The samples were examined for their somatic cell count (SCC), fat ratio, protein ratio, lactose 
ratio, total solid ratio, and the concentrations of urea nitrogen and citric acid. Due to the fact that biomolecular 
adsorption is dependent on time without an externally applied voltage [19], contact angle measurements for 
each test are completed within one minute to minimize biomolecular passive adsorption on hydrophobic 
surfaces. 
The contact angle of droplets in electrowetting is measured by depositing a 3μL milk droplet onto the 
substrate and inserting a Pt electrode. A variety of DC voltages, ranging from 0 to 130 volts, were tested. 
Because the components of the milk significantly adsorbed on the hydrophobic surface, freshly prepared 
insulating films were used in all experiments. No electrolysis or measurable electric current was apparent 
between the Pt electrode and the ITO electrode upon application of 130 volts, indicating that the combined 
dielectric layer behaved as an insulator and failed to undergo dielectric breakdown. In addition, contact angles 
were determined independently from images of the sessile drop by numerically fitting a tangent close to the 
contact line. At least three experiments for each case were conducted. 
III. Results and Discussions 
This study analyzed the compositions of milk and contact angle in electrowetting with the sessile drop 
method, and investigated the relationships among them. In general, the threshold value of normal milk is 
defined by somatic cell count (SCC) less than 50 (104/mL) or electrical conductivity (EC) less than 6.0 (Ms) 
[26, 27]. All milk contains white blood cells known as leukocytes, which constitute the majority of somatic 
cells. Leukocytes accumulate at sites of inflammation to attack invading bacteria; therefore, somatic cell count 
can be used to assess the level of udder inflammation. The maximum EC value of normal milk sampled in this 
study was 5.5 (Ms). According to the composition of milk shown in Table 1, SCC is negatively correlated 
with the content of citric acid in all milk samples [32, 33]. In other words, as SCC increases in milk, the 
content of citric acid reduces, (Figure 2). This phenomenon is caused mainly by the physiological response of 
the udders of dairy cows. Except for the relationship between SCC and citric acid, we observed no other 
 5
adsorptions but increases the electrowetting effect. Therefore, the threshold value of the combined effect of 
EC and SCC in electrowetting is worthy of further investigation to build an alternatively electrowetting-based 
method for detecting cow mastitis. 
IV. Conclusion 
This study determined that somatic cell count (SCC) is negatively correlated to the concentration of citric 
acid in milk, such that the more SCC there is in milk, the less citric acid there is. To gain a better 
understanding of electrowetting as it pertains to SCC, EC was maintained at same value for each sample. The 
results indicate that changes in electrowetting contact angle with higher SCC are less than with lower SCC. 
This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that with higher SCC biomolecular adsorption increases the 
effective thickness of the dielectric layer, despite the fact that a less pronounced change in contact angle 
induced by lower electrowetting effect was observed.

dairy cows in foremilk was sampled from a Holstein herd and examined for its
electrical conductivity (EC), somatic cell count (SCC) and other milk compositions. The
measured milk compositions included fat rate, protein rate, lactose rate, total solid
rate, urea nitrogen and citric acid. For minimizing biomolecular adsorption on
hydrophobic surfaces, contact angle measurement for each experiment was
completed within one minute. Due to significant negative correlation between SCC
and citric acid in milk, the static contact angles saturated above 120 volts are more
influenced by citric acid than by SCC and other milk compositions based on the same
EC value. Two possible reasons for this as we observed: One reason is that the
increase in concentration of citric acid would increase the ionic strength in milk, which

the substrate would increase effective thickness of the dielectric, which would
decrease the cosƟv of Lippmann‐Young equation and increaseƟv at saturated voltage.
Therefore, static saturation contact angles in electrowetting were decreased
obviously by higher concentration of citric acid for the same EC value.

This study found that as somatic cell counts with the citric acid concentration
showed a negative correlation in raw milk, that is, somatic cell count increases,
but the concentration of citric acid decreases oppositely. Under the same
electrical conductivity in normal milk, there are two possible reasons for a little
change in electowetting contact angle. One reason is that a higher somatic cell
counts will induce the higher amounts of somatic cell adsorbed on the surface of
the insulating layer, which reduces the electrowetting effect and retains the
change in contact angle. Another reason is the citric acid concentration decreased
that reduces the solution ionic strength, which also induces the electrowetting
effect decreased.
