二、研究目的 
    本研究項目之目的為針對 HIT 太陽電池中，a-Si/C-Si 的界面特性進行探
討，一個基本的 HIT 太陽電池是由 μc-Si(n)/a-Si(i)/C-Si(p) 所組成，μc-Si(n) 及 
a-Si(i) 是由 HWCVD 沉積所得。而 a-Si(i) 層扮演著很重要的角色，因為 a-Si(i) 
扮演著填補單晶矽基板表面的缺陷 (如：斷鍵，懸浮鍵，不穩定的表面鍵結)。
HIT 太陽電池經過 a-Si(i) 填補過的表面的缺陷後，可以減少光電流在 μc-Si(n) 
與 C-Si(p) 界面產生複合，因而提高太陽電池元件效率。 
    針對 μc-Si(n) 與 C-Si(p) 於太陽電池中的界面特性進行模擬分析，一方面
不斷改進製程技術，期望將實際 HIT 太陽電池的轉換效率提供至 20 %；另一
方面則希望藉由模擬得到 HIT 太陽電池之最佳化結構，縮短研發時程，降低成
本。 TCAD 可以定義材料缺陷，更可以由模擬中得到元件中電場的分布，光電
流在元件的分布狀況，這一些模擬是 PC1D 軟體所無法達到的。 
 
三、研究方法 
 首先我們要針對所有製程條件及參數作定義，這些需要有準確的實驗數據做
基礎。包括光學特性、電特性及元件結構等精確的定義，然後再經過 TCAD 軟
體模擬與 HIT 太陽電池元件結構最佳化，即可得到最佳的 HIT 太陽電池元件
最佳特性，針對這些模擬結果再修正製程參數，即可得到最佳化之 HIT 太陽電
池元件。本計劃的模擬程序將配合中興大學材料系的 HWCVD，將模擬與實驗
兩者互相比較驗證，以期得到最佳化的 HIT 太陽電池元件效率。

4.3 元件模擬光的吸收分佈 
    我們設置標準太陽模擬光源(AM1.5,100 mW)於元件正上方，垂直照射進入
元件後材料對於光吸收的分布比例圖，從圖中顏色分佈可以知道光被利用的比
例。由這個模擬可以觀察光吸收的情形進而了解基板厚度的最佳化。 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4 電場分佈 
在模擬量測元件特性時，除了照射標準光外，在下電極(anode)逐漸施加電壓 
0 V 至 1 V，由圖中可以看出下電極是 1 V，往上電極會逐漸減少。 
 
圖 4 光吸收利用率分布圖 
圖 5 電場分布圖 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 電子產生率分佈 
    下圖顯示元件在光照射下，電子濃度分佈圖，由圖可以看到電子濃度往上電
極越來越濃，因為電子受到 pn 接面內建電場驅動關係，會往 n 層移動，所以
在電極附近電子濃度最高。

高，但在 1019 cm-3 時，反而形成短波段光利用率提高，長波段光利用率減少，
由於摻雜濃度過高，造成载子容易複合損失。

deposition rate, gas decomposition, and no ion
bombardment. To our knowledge, the best HJ solar
cell with an efﬁciency of 182% by HWCVD has been
fabricated by the group at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory.4 The emitter layer in the HJ solar
cell is usually highly doped to reduce the series
resistance and very thin to minimize the recombination
of photogenerated carriers in the layer. In addition, it
has been reported that the interface condition, such as
band offset and interface defects, signiﬁcantly affects
the carrier transport and photovoltaic properties of
these solar cells.7–9 Techniques for obtaining a high-
quality interface include bandgap grading and passiva-
tion of the interface states by chemical HF etching,10
atomic hydrogen treatment,8 and deposition of an a-
Si:H passivation layer.11,12
The simulation of the electrical and optical behavior
of semiconductor devices has been established as an
essential tool for both the improvement of existing
devices and the development of new ones. Numerical
modeling is increasingly used to obtain an insight into
the details of the physical operation of solar cells. Over
the years several modeling tools such as Pc1D,13
AMPS,14 SCAPS,15,16 and ASA17 speciﬁc to PV
devices have been developed. Numerical simulation is
routinely performed in developing and studying
crystalline silicon solar cells. Amongst the various
programs in use, Pc1D is more or less a standard in the
ﬁeld. Physical device modeling in thin-ﬁlm photo-
voltaic is less developed than for a crystalline silicon
solar cell, owing to the more complicated physics
involved. Pc1D was originally developed by Basore
and coworkers at Sandia National Labs18 and was
further developed at UNSW, Australia.
Amorphous/crystalline HJ silicon solar cells, indium
tin oxide (ITO)/a-Si:H(n)/c-Si(p), are investigated by
means of numerical computer simulation.19,20 It is the
aim of this work to improve the understanding of this
device and to derive arguments for design optimization.
Several measurement results have been taken into the
Pc1D program to yield the convergence. However,
some uncertainty parameters will eventually generate
problems that will converge to failure and inaccuracy.
In general, simulation convergence failure and inac-
curacy may occur due to the following reasons:
(1) The Pc1D computer program is limited to one-
dimensional modeling. However, the a-Si and mc-
Si layers are not spatially homogeneous materials.
(2) Some material parameters such as electron and
hole diffusivity, front-surface and real-surface
recombination, and diffusion length have been
assumed in this study.
(3) Although the parameters such as band gap, mobi-
lity, absorption, and doping concentration in sili-
con ﬁlms were determined by our measurements,
the accuracy in each measurement has not been
considered.
(4) Although the front contact plays an important role21
and recombination losses at the Aluminium back
contact are signiﬁcant in single-side HJ devices22, in
this study both contacts have been considered ideal
for simplicity. However, the recombination losses in
the ITO/emitter-layer and c-Si/Al interface of device
have not been considered.
(5) The defect stares in each layer and interface
including emitter-layer, emitter-layer/i-layer inter-
face, i-layer and i-layer/c-Si interface have not
been taken into account in the present simulation
modeling.
(6) The optimized optical design of the solar cell
including the low surface reﬂection, high internal
design, and high back reﬂection has not been taken
into account in the present simulation modeling.
SIMULATION DETAILS
Modeling
A schematic diagram of the device is displayed in the
parameter view, providing visual feedback of doping,
texturing, and internal shunt elements. The exploration
of new cell design is greatly simpliﬁed by the use of
good visualization tools. In contrast, traditional
numerical simulators describe a cell via a textual
listing of parameters. This becomes cumbersomewhen
complex designs are used. It is easy to make mistakes
when entering parameters and such errors can be
difﬁcult to trace. Figure 1 aids in visualizing the cell
structure being simulated; the parameter view of PclD
now includes a device schematic. We used Pc1D for
solving the one-dimensional semiconductor equations
based on Shockley–Read Hall recombination statistics.
For the individual semiconducting layers, as well as for
the interfaces between them, particular defect state
distributions have to be speciﬁed.
Input parameters
Before simulating any device, we have to describe the
materials that are used to build the structure as well as

this work. A schematic diagram of this device is shown
in Figure 1b. The ITO and Al (grid) ﬁlms used in these
devices were deposited using an electron-gun thermal
evaporator.
The crystallinity of the as-deposited Si ﬁlms was
evaluated by Raman scattering spectroscopy. The
Raman signal due to the transverse optical mode was
deconvoluted into three components: Ic (approxi-
mately 520 cm1, crystalline phase with a grain size
larger than 10 nm), Im (approximately 510 cm
1,
crystalline phase with a grain size smaller than
10 nm), and Ia (approximately 480 cm
1, amorphous
phase). The crystalline fraction Xc was deﬁned as
Xc¼ (Icþ Im)/(Icþ Imþ Ia).23 The optical absorption a
and band gap energy Eg were determined from spectral
optical transmission measurements using the Tauc’s
plot. The carrier concentration Ns and the mobility
were measured by the van der Pauw–Hall measure-
ment. Temperature-dependent dark conductivity sd
was used to calculate the dopant activation energy Ea.
Details of the deposition conditions and properties of
all silicon ﬁlms (n-Si, i-Si and p-Si) were summarized
in our earlier report.24–27 The solar cell (1 1 cm2)
characteristics such as short circuit current density Jsc,
open circuit voltage Voc, ﬁll factor FF, conversion
efﬁciency h, and external quantum efﬁciency EQE
were measured at 100mW/cm2 (AM 15) using a solar
simulator.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of thickness and crystallinity mechanism
The effects of HJ solar cell performance on silicon
thickness, silicon crystalline, and a-Si/c-Si interface
will be discussed in this section. The absorption of
silicon ﬁlm was increasing with increasing the ﬁlm
thickness, but was decreasing with decreasing the ﬁlm
crystallinity. The experimental results suggest that the
emitter layer should be kept as thin as technologically
possible: since a-Si:H is much more defective than
c-Si, most carriers generated in the emitter recombine.
The diffusion length of holes in the emitter is in the
range of a few nanometers only. A thinner emitter will
therefore enhance the quantum efﬁciency in the short
wavelength region (300 nm to 650 nm), where emitter
absorption is signiﬁcant. The crystallinity of undoped
or doped mc-Si ﬁlm can be controlled by changing
hydrogen dilution, substrate temperature, and ﬁlament
temperature. For solar cell simulation in this section,
an i-layer was deposited prior to the n-layer deposited.
The n-layer with higher crystallinity shows the better
transparency. Considering the strong inﬂuence of
n-layer crystallinity on the performance of solar cells,
solar cells were simulated at different n-layer crystal-
linities.
Figure 2 shows the a-Si naturally provides surface
passivation of the c-Si with hydrogen atoms, leading to
a relatively high-quality junction. The deposition
parameters have a crucial effect on the i-layer
passivation properties on the c-Si surface, i.e., the
silane (SiH4) concentration in the gas mixture,
(fSiH4)/(fSiH4þfH2). The i-layer crystallinity
depends on the (fSiH4)/(fSiH4þfH2) ratio. Gener-
ally, purely a-Si layers with low crystallinity were
grown at low hydrogen dilution, poly-Si layers with
high crystallinity deposited at high hydrogen dilution.
On the contrary, the hydrogen content in the ﬁlm
decreases when the i-layer crystallinity increased.24
The i-layer with low crystallinity and high hydrogen
content provides good surface passivation.
Effect of silicon ﬁlm thickness
HJ solar cells with different n-layer emitter thicknesses
(dn¼ 1–60 nm) and with a 5 nm intrinsic buffer layer at
themc-Si/c-Si interface were simulated. These ﬁndings
are in agreement with the behavior of Jsc and Voc shown
in Figure 3. With decreasing n-layer thickness the Jsc is
strongly enhanced while the Voc is inﬂuenced only
little. The FF values are independent of the n-layer
thickness. The reduction of the thickness results in an
increase of the efﬁciency up to nearly 188% (n-
layer¼ 1 nm). We chose microcrystalline silicon ﬁlm
as an n-type emitter layer measured and shown in
Table I. This was foreseen because the emitter layer
acts mainly as a ‘‘dead layer’’28 in which almost all the

higher than 730 nm, the mc-Si layer is transparent and
the EQE is only determined by the substrate and back
contact properties.
The a-Si buffer layers with different thicknesses
were used to ﬁnd the optimum performance of the solar
cells. It occurs for thinner intrinsic buffer layers that
the EQE is enhanced in the blue spectral region
(Figure 5). For this reason, the a-Si layer has to be as
thin as possible. Therefore, the 1 nm a-Si buffer layer
was found to be optimum for HJ solar cell. The poor
blue response of the cell can be explained by the
optical properties of the thin a-Si buffer layer. Lower
EQE at short wavelengths leads to low Voc and can be
observed which might be imputable to i-layer, whose
absorption coefﬁcient was remarkably high. In that
sense, intrinsic mc-Si is able to employ to lower optical
losses while keeping good electrical properties.
Effect of silicon ﬁlm crystallinity
The above discussion on the n-layer thickness of
heterojunction solar cells is based on a ﬁxed crystal-
linity (70%) of the n-layer. Now we address the
inﬂuences of the n-layer crystallinity on the photo-
voltaic performance. In this study, the chosen
parameters for Pc1D modeling, as listed in Table II,
include: n-Si/c-Si structure with an intrinsic layer, n-
layer thickness of 15 nm, i-layer thickness of 5 nm,
substrate thickness of 250mm and various n-layer and
i-layer crystallinities between 0% and 100%.
Figure 6 shows the dependency of solar cell
parameters on the crystallinity of the n-layer and
i-layer for the simplest cell structure. The crystallinity
of undoped or doped mc-Si ﬁlms can be controlled by
changing the hydrogen dilution, the substrate tempera-
ture, and the ﬁlament temperature (see our early
report25). The solar cells with n-layer/i-layer/c-Si
structure were set for simulation in this object. The
study of the inﬂuence of the n-layer crystallinity on the
performance of solar cells was carried out. From
Figure 6, it was found that both Jsc and Voc increase
with n-layer crystallinity increasing. But we also found
that all parameters decrease with the n-layer crystal-
linity in the value of full crystalline as single-
crystalline silicon material. In this case, the parameters
of the cell drop down to values as found for the cell
with the lowest bandgap material (c-Si bandgap¼ 11).
It can be seen that due to the better transparency of

collected. Thus, the blue response of the EQE spectrum
is enhanced. However, the main effect of the crystal-
linity of the intrinsic buffer layer is to ensure a better
emitter/wafer interface passivation.
Experimental results
The structure of Al/ITO/n-Si/i-Si/c-Si/i-Si/p-Si/ITO/
Al double-side HJ solar cells with different n-type mc-
Si emitter thicknesses and with an intrinsic buffer layer
(5 nm) was deposited. The experimental Jsc–Voc curves
and detail parameters of solar cell under illumination
are shown in Figure 9. The results show the
dependencies of solar cell performances on the
thickness of the n-layer for a double-side HJ structure.
It was found that the Jsc decreases with increasing
emitter thickness. The reduction of the thickness
results in an increase of the efﬁciency up to nearly 16%
(n-layer 15 nm). The main reason for this improve-
ment is the increase of the short circuit current. The
moderate Jsc of 28mA/cm
2 (Et¼ 60 nm) could be
mainly attributed to optical losses in the thick emitter
layer. Beside, the cell with a thin emitter layer
Et¼ 10 nm has a larger Jsc but has lesser Voc and FF.
The low values of Voc and FF may come from an
emitter layer which is too thin and non-uniform. The
open circuit voltage decreases slightly for thick ﬁlms.
It should be mentioned that for thicknesses smaller
than 10 nm the open circuit voltage drops down to
values around 06V due to local shunting of the pn-
junction by the ITO layer because of the inhomogen-
eity of the n-layer deposition. The ﬁll factor of the cells
decreases from 73% to 64% because the contribution
of the n-layer of the series resistance is increased. The
low FF of 64% should be improved after optimizing
some technological steps to reduce the parasitical
series resistance and to passivate the interface of a-Si/
c-Si.
The EQE measurement gives access to the different
loss mechanism limiting the current density and thus
the cell efﬁciency. We can give three regions in the
EQE spectrum with wavelength between 300Ynm and
1200Ynm. Region 1 (300–500 nm): for the short
wavelength region the EQE is reduced by absorption in
the ITO and the a-Si or mc-Si emitter layer. Region 2
(500–800 nm): the maximum EQE is also reduced by a
slight absorption of 3–5% in the ITO layer. Region 3
(800–1200 nm): the EQE in the long wavelength
region is limited by the back surface recombination.
Since for these wavelengths the a-Si or mc-Si layer is
transparent the emitter layer has no inﬂuence on the
current collection on the backside of the cell. Figure 10
shows the EQE as a function of the n-layer thickness. It
can be seen that for thinner n-layer the quantum
efﬁciency is enhanced, especially in the blue spectral
region where the absorption of the mc-Si ﬁlms is high.
It is the difference between simulated and measured
EQE curves, especially in the blue region of the
spectrum. The measured curves are low compared to
the simulated ones. In the simulated EQE curve, the
front-contact of solar cell is ideal. However, the
absorption and recombination losses in the ITO and
ITO/emitter-layer interface of device have not been
considered. The blue region of the measured EQE
spectrum is reduced by absorption in the ITO. On the
other hand, at a wavelength higher than 700 nm, the
mc-Si n-layer is transparent and the quantum efﬁciency

thicknesses of the doped n-layer and the intrinsic
buffer layer were 1 nm and 5 nm. The substrate
thickness (1V-cm) was sated at 200mm.
The simulated J–V curve and the EQE spectrum of
the best HJ solar cell are shown in Figure 13(a) and (b).
Due to the passivation effect of i-layer, the ﬁll factor
can be further increased. Thus the efﬁciencies of the Si
HJ solar cells using p-type substrates can reach 21%.
From the EQE spectra, it can be seen that the spectral
response is very high at the wavelength between 400
and 1000 nm. The EQE loss in the blue region of the Si
HJ solar cell using a p-type substrate is very low. In
addition, the higher collection efﬁciency in the red
region could result from the thinner substrate thickness
and/or BSF structures, achieving lower carrier recom-
bination.
Figure 14(a) shows the current–voltage character-
istic of one of our best single-side solar cells measured
under one-sun condition. After optimizing the depo-
sition parameters (PH3 doping ratio¼ 09%, ITO
deposition temperature T¼ 2308C, n-type mc-Si layer
thickness dn¼ 15 nm) of the n-layer and the H2
pretreatment of the solar cell, the n-type mc-Si/c-Si HJ
solar cell with Jsc¼ 346mA/cm2, Voc¼ 0615V,
FF¼ 71%, and an efﬁciency of 152% has been
achieved. The low ﬁll factor of 71% should be
improved after optimizing some technological steps to
reduce the parasitical series resistance.
