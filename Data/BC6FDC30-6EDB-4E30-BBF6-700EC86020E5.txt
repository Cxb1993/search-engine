Progression of nonlinear wave groups to breaking was studied 
numerically and experimentally. Evolution of such wave group 
parameters as distance to breaking and modulation depth was 
described. Numerical model demonstrated a good qualitative 
agreement with experimental results in describing the 
behaviour of distance to breaking and modulation depth as 
functions of initial wave steepnesses. It was shown that 
energy loss appears to be a function of modulation depth. 
Energy loss grows with modulation depth up to a certain 
threshold of the latter. It was also shown that breaking 
probability for wave groups with modulation depth below 2.2 
is very low.

1. Introduction 
Wave-breaking is a frequent event observed by everyone who has ever been to a 
sea. It plays an important role in the air-sea interaction, influences the dynamics of the 
upper ocean and exchanges of energy, momentum and gases between the atmosphere 
and the ocean. Breaking of waves limits the height of the waves, generates new waves, 
transfers momentum from the wind to surface currents. Wave breaking is of great 
importance for maritime and coastal engineering applications, as it imposes large forces 
on ships and offshore structures. Thus, wave breaking plays a significant role in many 
meteorological and oceanographical processes. Understanding of this interesting 
phenomenon, however, is still quite blurred. Over the last thirty years wave breaking 
has been studied via experimental, theoretical and numerical approaches, and a 
significant progress in theoretical understanding of wave instabilities has been made. 
Still, significant work is required in order to understand how breaking rates can be 
predicted and how wave breaking can be described as a function of the physical 
characteristics of real waves. 
One of characteristics that influences the contribution of breaking waves to all the 
processes mentioned above is breaking severity or breaking strength. Breaking severity, 
together with breaking probability, provide the means of statistical description of the 
wave energy dissipation (see e.g. Babanin 2009). Breaking severity is an amount of 
energy lost in an individual breaking event. 
Measurements of the breaking severity in the open sea are extremely complicated 
and need expensive equipment. That is why this parameter is investigated in laboratory 
experiments. A number of important laboratory studies were performed over the last 
twenty years, but the means by which the wave breaking was achieved could be 
 3
2. Numerical simulation of the breaking onset 
The present study is dedicated to investigation of properties of the breaking waves 
and wave groups which contain the breaking, and to evolution of parameters responsible 
for the breaking. As mentioned above, simulation of the evolution of waves to the point 
of breaking is done by means of fully-nonlinear Chalikov-Sheinin (CS) model 
(Chalikov and Sheinin 2005). CS model is a numerical scheme for direct hydrodynamic 
modelling of 1-D nonlinear gravity and gravity-capillary periodic waves based on 
conformal mapping of a finite-depth water domain. The classical complex variable 
method was originally developed by Stokes (Stokes 1847), and for the stationary 
problem it employs the velocity potential   and the stream function   as 
independent variables. The non-stationary conformal method was introduced by a 
number of scientists back in 1970s (e.g. Whitney 1971). In CS model the non-stationary 
conformal mapping allows rewriting the principal equations of a potential flow with a 
free surface in a surface-following coordinate system. The hydrodynamic system is 
represented by two relatively simple evolutionary equations that can be solved 
numerically in a straightforward way. 
CS model has some important characteristics. The principal advantage of this 
scheme is that it demonstrates much greater accuracy compared to most of other 
existing schemes. That comes with a high computational efficiency. CS scheme 
preserves integral invariants, which gives an opportunity to use it for long processes. 
This scheme is able to reproduce a nonlinear concentration of energy in physical space 
resulting in wave breaking, and potentially in appearance of freak waves. CS scheme 
demonstrates stability over thousands of periods of dominant wave.

Beginning of the run. (right) End of the run, one period before the breaking.  
Figure 1 demonstrates surface elevation Z  of three modulated wave trains with 
the same steepness of the carrier wave 1 =0.23 and of the sideband 2 0.033  . 
Steepnesses are 1 1 1a k   and 2 2 2a k  , where 1a  and 2a  are the wave amplitudes 
of primary and second waves. In the non-dimensional model, however, the wave 
amplitude is not an independent parameter and is defined by a choice of the wave 
steepness and wavenumber. Bandwidth   is varied and as a result these wave groups 
have different numbers of waves in a modulation 1/N  . In the Figure, this number 
is 16.5 in the top panel, 6.9 in the middle and 4.5 at the bottom: broader bandwidth 
corresponds to fewer waves in the modulation. For further simulations we use 6.9N  , 
as this is closest to those occurring in natural wave fields. In the Figure, snapshots of the 
computational domain are shown for two moments: in Figure 1 (left) this moment is the 
beginning of the run, and in Figure 1 (right) it is one period before the breaking. 
Number of points n in the domain is the number of grid points: n=4*M, where M is a 
truncation number of the Fourier transform (spatial resolution) used in the program. The 
non-dimensional wave number of the primary mode is 32, so there are 32 wave crests in

Lifetime itself also decreases with 1  (Figure 3). Babanin et al. (2007) found that 
all waves ultimately break when they reach a certain limiting steepness 0.44  . In SC 
numerical model limiting steepness is lower due to strictly two-dimensional nature of 
the crest, and is only  ~0.3 (see discussions in Babanin et al. 2007, 2009 whose 
experiments also showed that the higher the initial steepness is, the faster the wave can 
reach its limiting steepness and break).  
Since in our initially modulated wave trains the lifetime also depends on 1 2/   
(Figure 2), values of lifetime for 1 2/ 7    in Figure 3 are generally smaller than for 
1 2/ 30   . Fitted lines show that lifetime decreases with 1  exponentially:

As it has already been mentioned, we generated wave groups that are modulated initially. 
Modulation depth tends to grow with time: in Figure 1 it can be clearly seen that 
modulation depth at the moment of one period before breaking is much higher than the 
initial modulation depth.

(stars), 1 2/ 30    (diamonds), 1 2/ 36   (asterisks). Solid 
( 1 2/ 7   , 1 2/ 36   ), dotted ( 1 2/ 16.5   , 1 2/ 30   ) and dashed 
( 1 2/ 11   , 1 2/ 20   ) lines are exponential functions: 
7 133exp( 14 ) 1z    , 11 1216exp( 22 ) 1z    , 16 1451exp( 25 ) 1z    ,

 11
modulation depth for higher values of 1  in most cases is smaller than for lower values 
of 1 . This difference can be expected from Figure 4, but not as large as pictured in 
Figure 5. The reason appears to rest with the third parameter which affects R  at the 
breaking point, and that is the lifetime of the wave. Modulation depth grows in time, 
and for waves with higher initial primary steepness it grows faster (Figure 6). But waves 
with higher initial primary steepness also have much shorter lifetime, as they reach the 
limiting steepness quicker (Figures 3, 6). That is why modulation depth for waves with 
higher initial steepness does not have enough time to grow to the levels achievable for 
waves with lower steepness. That is clearly shown in Figure 6: the wave with 1 0.17   
has twice as long lifetime as the wave with 1 0.25  , and the modulation depth before 
breaking is more than twice larger.

1 0.23  , 2 0.086  . 
Example of a modulated wave train is shown in Figure 8. It is clearly seen how the 
initially moderate grouping develops into strong saw-tooth modulation consistent both 
with the numerical simulations above and with analytical expectations for the 
modulational-instability evolution (Shemer and Dorfman 2008)

Wavelengths   generated in this experiment varied from 0.8 to 1.6 meters, most 
measurements were conducted for waves with 0.9 1.2    meters. The water level in 
the tank was 1.2 meters, and therefore the deep-water conditions were satisfied. 
Experimental results show good qualitative agreement with predictions of CS 
model. As it was expected (Figure 2), distance to the breaking grows logarithmically as 
a function of 1 2/   (Figure 9). As it was also expected (Figure 4), modulation depth 
exponentially decreases with primary wave steepness 1  (Figure 10). For the 
modulation depth R , even quantitative agreement between model and experiment is 
good, and in both Figures 4 and 10 the value of R  for 1 0.24 0.25    is 
approximately 2 – 2.5. In Figure 10 R  decreases further with increasing 1 . 
Numerical modelling and even laboratory measurements of the breaking severity 
represent considerable challenge and the knowledge of this important property is sparse. 
Rapp and Melville (1990) found that the loss of energy ranged from 10% for single 
spilling events to 25% for plunging breakers. Similar results were obtained by Kway et 
al. (1997): they had energy loss varying from 14% to 22% for different plunging waves. 
These were investigations of the breaking achieved by means of the linear wave 
superposition. Babanin (2009), however, demonstrated that in case of breaking brought 
about by the nonlinear evolution of wave trains, the breaking severity can vary broadly 
from virtually 0% to 100%. 
In this study, wave energy is estimated for one group as

waves with 1  m. Solid line is exponential fit: 50exp( 18 ) 1.6z x   . 
Decay due to wall friction was estimated for a monochromatic train of 
non-breaking waves. Average energy of a wave in such a train decreases exponentially: 
for example, for 1   for our data on gauges 2-6 the approximation is 
( ) 142exp( 0.0003 )E d d  , and for 1.2   it is ( ) 125exp( 0.0002 )E d d  , where 
d  is the distance covered by the wave, and E  is the average energy of the wave. 
Because the losses are small, this exponential function can be easily replaced by a linear 
function. Knowledge of energy of these non-breaking waves on each gauge allows 
calculating the coefficient of energy loss due to decay: 1 /j jE E  , where j  is a 
gauge number. It can be found that the average coefficient for the waves with 
0.9 ~ 1  m is 0.96  , and for 1.2   it is 0.98  . The distance between the 
gauges 2-6 was approximately the same

Figure 11. Severity coefficient ( . 9)S Eq  as a function of modulation depth ( . 5)R Eq  
for all wavelengths and steepnesses. Solid line is parameterisation Eq. (10).  
The scatter of the severity coefficient in Figure 11 is significant. This points out 
that the breaking strength is a complex property which perhaps depends on many factors, 
rather than on dynamics identified by the modulation depth R  at the breaking onset. It 
should be also kept in mind that measurements of both R  and S  in the experiment 
bear some uncertainties. One of the measuremental errors of R  is due to the distance 
from the gauge to the beginning of breaking. Although the wave-breaking groups were 
selected in such a way that the breaking onset is close enough to one of the wave probes, 
obvious variability is unavoidable in such method. With respect to the energy lost, here 
we base our estimate on measurements of the surface elevation only (i.e. Eqs. (8)-(9) 
where the changes of kinetic energy are not accounted for explicitly, although their 
proportion of contributions to the total energy loss in a non-linear wave system can be 
different to that of potential energy).

up to R =3.3, and then S  decreases (Figure 12, top panel). The highest value of R  is 
19% for R =3.3. The correlation coefficient between S  and R  for the range of 
growing R  (Figure 12, top panel) is K =0.56

 . 
In Figure 12 the data is separated into groups in terms of wavelengths. But 
wavelength is a dimensional parameter and therefore cannot be used for general 
speculations about the dependence. Attempts to sort the data out by initial steepness of 
the carrier wave 1  and ratio of initial steepnesses of the carrier wave and sideband 
1 2/   were unsuccessful. Such separation decreases correlation coefficients between 
R  and S . Figure 13 demonstrates severity coefficient versus modulation depth for 
data sorted out by total steepness, a nondimensional parameter 1 2    . The 
strongest dependence is for medium values of total steepness 0.35 ~ 0.4  ( K =0.71, 
Table 1), the approximation is: 
)15.04.0()05.018.0(3  RS . (14)
For smaller values 0.2 ~ 0.3   and 0.3 ~ 0.35  , saturation of the severity values 
S  at higher R  can perhaps be suggested, similarly to that discussed with respect to 
Figure 12 above. Since it is not quite distinct, it was not quantified, and as a result, the 
respective correlation coefficients are lower (Table 1). For these data groups, breaking 
severity as a function of modulation depth is approximated as 
1 (0.2 0.07) (0.41 0.14)S R     (15)
2 (0.14 0.03) (0.31 0.09)S R     (16)
For higher total steepnesses no dependence could be traced because of the limited range 
of variation of R  and S .

Eq.(16) (right upper panel), and Eq.(14) (left lower panel). 
 
Thus, the severity loss S  was parameterised to grow linearly with modulation 
depth R , up to a certain threshold of R  as described above. To reduce the scatter of 
the parameterisation, yet alone to introduce nonlinear parameterisations, and to 
investigate variation and causes of the threshold, further experimental investigations are 
required.

experiments with CS model have been conducted which are instructive to accompany 
conclusions and future directions of the present paper. The simulations showed that 
weak and moderate wind forcing tends to reduce lifetime (increase breaking probability, 
see also Babanin et al. 2007), but for strong wind forcing this reduction significantly 
slows down. The logarithmic increase of lifetime as a function of 1 2/   is distorted if 
moderate-to-strong wind forcing is applied.  
Figure 14 demonstrates lifetime as a function of the ratio 1 2/   with moderately 
strong wind forcing /U c =4, where U  is the wind speed in non-dimensional CS 
model, and c  is the phase speed of the primary wave. When values of 1  are low, 
lifetime first rapidly grows and then reaches saturation, i.e. stays approximately 
constant (Figure 14). In our simulations, for 1 0.17   lifetime reaches saturation, for 
example, when 1 2/ 16.5    (Figure 14), but for 1 0.24   it continues to grow and 
can be approximated by a logarithmic function, just like in the absence of wind (Figures 
2, 14). In general wind increases breaking probability and, therefore, reduces lifetime 
which is consistent with the previous observations. It is interesting to notice that in the 
presence of this strong wind forcing, for high values of 1 2/   steeper waves have 
smaller breaking probability (longer distance to breaking, Figure 14).  
Stronger wind always reduces modulation depth. This has been found numerically 
for initially modulated wave groups in the present research project (Figure 15), and also 
observed experimentally in self-modulated wave trains by Babanin et al (2009). 
 
 27
This fact emphasizes that the question about the actual role of the wind in wave 
breaking is very important and is still in need of serious investigation. 
Wind forcing, as well as nonlinear modulation, is an integral part of field 
conditions. This makes nonlinear modulation in the presence of wind a promising and 
interesting subject of future research. Also, of interest are the following topics: severity 
loss for higher values of modulation depth, development of new wave groups after 
breaking and multiple breaking events, breaking severity of three-dimensional waves 
with continuous spectrum.

與會心得： 
亞太海岸會議已舉辦過五屆，論文篇數及參加人數，均逐年增
加，因為中國大陸是主要發起國家之一，台灣參與的學者不多，不過
經歷五屆之發展，亞洲及大洋洲國家參與的學者漸多，這種趨勢台灣
不能忽視。第六屆（2011 年）已決定在香港大學舉辦，會議規模可
能再次擴大，第七屆（2013 年）將在印尼巴里島舉行，台灣可爭取
以後會議之主辦權。 
 
亞洲國家中，日本在海岸方面之研究，一向基於領先地位，台灣
亦屬先進國家，曾於 1986 年主辦過國際海岸工程會議，當時申請人
即為核心人士之一。相對於日本及台灣，中國及韓國在海岸方面之研
究起步較慢，但最近兩國的研究人力及研究成果均有大幅成長，讓人
感受深刻。

Fig. 4 Wave profiles of the solitary wave at various time steps
When it experiences the slope, the wave profile becomes steep and another solitary 
wave is decomposed from the primary solitary wave, traveling at the opposite direction
The amplitude of the primary solitary wave decreases due to the viscous 
effect.  Meanwhile, the celerity of the primary solitary wave is decelerated

® Results and Discussion
	 Spatial distribution flow field and turbulent kinetic energy
The strong turbulent energy 
does not disappear even the 
run-down commences (see 
Fig. 6(i) ). 
Fig. 6 (j) shows the 
velocity distribution when 
the wave almost reaches its 
highest runup point. 
When the runup tongue 
reaches its maximum 
height, most of the 
turbulence energy has 
almost disappeared.
