2 
are obtained separately for fertilization. To obtain more oocytes for fertilization, ovulatory 
stimulants such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Clomiphene, and GnRHa (gonadotropin 
releasing hormone analog) are often given. Next, sperm and oocytes are fertilized in vitro. The intra-
cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) technique is sometimes adopted to assist the fertilization at this 
stage. Although certain parts of the IVF procedure have been improved over the years, the overall 
pregnancy rates have just been slightly uplifted to around 30%. The most common question asked 
by IVF patients is “What are my chances of conceiving?” The answer to this difficult question 
typically considers patient age, day 3 serum FSH levels, and infertility diagnosis. However, many 
more parameters are known to influence the pregnancy rate, such as sperm quality, fertilization rate, 
rate of cleavage, embryo quality, and number of embryos transferred. With so many variables, it is 
difficult for the IVF clinician to accurately estimate the pregnancy rate. It is more difficult for the 
clinician to recognize trends and make informed decisions to optimize the success rates for each 
individual infertile couple. Decision making in IVF is usually based on a combination of the 
patient’s particular characteristics and the physician’s knowledge and clinical experiences. For most 
clinicians, the synthesis of previous experience with current situation becomes almost intuitive with 
time. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as ‘clinical judgment’. However, as the number of 
variables increases, the ease and accuracy of this approach decreases (Bustillo et al., 1993; Jurisica 
et al., 1998). Studies attempting to find the predictive power of particular information from IVF 
patient’s record have been performed (Bustillo et al., 1993; Hoover et al., 1995). However, only a 
limited (and fixed) number of attributes have been identified as significant in predicting pregnancy 
outcome. 
This research intends to propose a hybrid intelligence DM method useful for analyzing an IVF 
database. The proposed DM method could be applied to facilitate tailoring the IVF process to the 
individual patient with the aim to improve the pregnancy rate, and to better manage patient’s 
expectations by predicting the possible outcome of the therapy. 
 
2. Methodologies 
 
The IVF patient database used in this study was collected from the artificial reproductive center 
in a university hospital at Los Angeles, USA from December 1999 to July 2007. All patients treated 
in that period were included in this database. The original database contains 5275 treatment records 
(i.e., 5275 maternal patients) stored in Excel format. The age range of maternal patients is between 
17 and 57, with a median age of 39. The maternal patients aged over or equal to 40 constituted 
42.6% (2250 patients) of this data set. The number of embryos transferred ranges from 1 to 10 in 
this data set. Each record consists of 70 different attributes (69 instance attributes + an additional 
class attribute). While each instance attribute represents one part of the patient’s basic information, 
diagnosis, clinical tests, treatment methods, etc, the class attribute represents the final result 
(pregnant or not pregnant). Through discussion with domain experts, 38 attributes considered to 
probably influence the IVF outcome, were chosen from the original 69 attributes. The 38 attributes 
can be grouped into two categories, including 18 numeric (continuous) attributes and 20 text 
(discrete) attributes. Some of the text attributes were split into several independent attributes for 
analysis. For example, since every patient could have several diagnoses of infertility (infertility 
diagnosis), the ‘DiagCode’ attribute, which could contain several diagnostic code, was split into 18 
independent attributes, representing 18 different infertility diagnoses. Following attribute extension 
and deletion of redundant attributes, each record in the resulting data set consists of 67 attributes (18 
numeric attributes + 49 text attributes) plus one class attribute (t: pregnant, f: not pregnant). 
The See5 (RuleQuest Research, 2006) DT learning software, C4.5 subsequent window version, 
was applied in this study to build the DTs for predicting the IVF outcome. See5 has the ability to 
handle the missing data that is common in real-world datasets, especially the medical database like 
the one used in this study. See5 also includes a function for converting the generated DT into a set

The GA process was developed with Evolver (Palisade, 1998) operated in Excel. The developed 
GA model was integrated with the DT learning model (developed with See5) using the ‘loose 
coupling’ integration method (Medsker, 1995), in which individual intelligent system components 
communicate with each other using simple data files. The Evolver and See5 were linked through 
Macro and VB scripts in Excel using an execution file (See5X.exe) provided in See5. The genotypes 
of the best 10 DT learning individuals found by the proposed GA process are listed in Table 2. Table 
2 shows that the DT learning model performs well when the c and m parameters are set at 34% 
(genotype ‘10111’) and 5 (genotype ‘11’), respectively. Inclusion of attributes, such as EmTrans, 
Age, Retrvd, PGD, Diog A, Media2, ICSI, etc., confers higher fitness on the DT learning model 
during the learning process. Thus, by using a GA, not only was it possible to find the optimal subset 
of important IVF attributes, but also to determine the corresponding DT learning parameters 
effectively. The best DT learning individual found by the GA had a predictive accuracy of 73.2% 
(see Table 2), with c and m parameters of 34% and 5, respectively. Table 3 shows that the 
corresponding sensitivity and specificity of the DT learning-based predictive model can be 
computed as 71.6% (= 235/(235+93)) and 73.9% (= 537/(537+190)), respectively. Here, a DT 
learning model with age as the only attribute for IVF outcome prediction had a predictive accuracy 
of 60.7%. A substantial increase in predictive power has been achieved by considering more than 
just age as a predictor of IVF outcome. 
The optimal IVF attribute subset found by the proposed GA/DT method comprised 28 attributes 
(listed in Table 4). The corresponding use percentage of each attribute during the classification 
procedure (generated in See5) can be regarded as the relative importance of each attribute. These 
attributes are considered here to be the most important features directly affecting the pregnancy rate 
following an IVF treatment. To compare the GA method with other tools in terms of the ability of 
attribute (feature) selection for the DT learning model, multi-regression and principal component 
analysis (PCA) (Hotelling, 1993) were evaluated in the same way. The c and m parameters were set 
at their default values, 25% and 2, respectively, during the test. With all the IVF attributes (i.e., the 
67 attributes used in this research) included, the resulting predictive accuracy of the DT learning 
model was 62.3%. In the multi-regression analysis, when using p value of 0.05 for determining the 
statistical significance of the attribute, only six attributes were selected from the 67 considered 
attributes. With the six selected attributes (see Table 4), the resulting predictive accuracy of the DT 
learning model on the testing example set was 61.7%. The results of PCA analysis indicated that the 
first six principal components could explain 97.9% variation of the data. Therefore, the first six 
principal components were used for determining the important attributes. According to the 
eigenvectors of the selected principal components, 10 important original variables (attributes) were 
located with the criterion that the corresponding values in the eigenvectors were larger than +0.05 or 
smaller than –0.05 (see Table 4). With the 10 most discriminating attributes, the resulting predictive 
accuracy of the DT learning model was 64.8%. Both the multi-regression and PCA were executed 
here in MINITAB. Table 4 shows that ‘Age’ was the only attribute chosen simultaneously by the 
three attribute selection methods employed here. This result corresponds to the common knowledge 
in IVF clinics. Fig. 2 summarizes the predictive accuracy of each method compared here. The GA 
method performed better in attribute selection for DT learning model than the multi-regression and 
PCA, suggesting the effectiveness of the GA method adopted in this study.
