二、研究目的與文獻探討 
Let G be a graph and let u, v ∈ V(G). The degree of vertex v in G, written as degG(v), is the number of 
edges incident to v in G. In addition, δ(G) = min{degG(v)| v ∈ V(G)}. A path P[x0, xt] =  〈x0, x1, ⋅⋅⋅, xt〉 is a 
sequence of nodes such that two consecutive nodes are adjacent. t is the distance between nodes x0 and xt 
if P[x0, xt] is a shortest path in G. We use 0( , )G td x x  to denote the distance between x0 and xt in G, and 
use (u, v) to denote an edge whose endpoints are u and v. Moreover, a path 〈x0, x1, ⋅⋅⋅, xt〉 may contain 
other subpath, denoted as 〈x0, x1, ⋅⋅⋅, xi, P[xi, xj], xj, ⋅⋅⋅, xt〉, where P[xi, xj] = 〈xi, xi+1, ⋅⋅⋅,xj–1, xj〉. A cycle is a 
path with x0 = xt and t ≥ 3. A cycle (respectively, path) in G is called a Hamiltonian cycle (respectively, 
Hamiltonian path) if it contains every vertex of G exactly once.  
The pancyclicity of a network represents its power of embedding rings of all possible lengths. A graph 
G is called m-pancyclic whenever G contains a cycle of each length l for m ≤ l ≤ |V(G)|. A 3-pancyclic 
graph is called pancyclic. That is, a pancyclic graph contains rings of all possible lengths. The 
arrangement graph [19], the hypercomplete network [12], the WK-recursvie network [26], the alternating 
group graph [35], and the hyper-de Bruijn networks [27] are pancyclic. In addition, a graph is 
vertex-pancyclic (edge-pancyclic, respectively) if every vertex (edge, respectively) lies on a cycle of 
every length from 3 to |V(G)|. It is clear that if a graph G is edge-pancyclic then it is vertex-pancyclic 
certainly. The twisted cube [11], the folded Petersen cube network [40], the crossed cube [10], the Möbius 
cube [32], the supercube [7], the hyper Petersen network [17], the locally twisted cubes [46], and the 
recursive circulant graphs with some condition [5], are 4-pancyclic. 
A graph G is m-vertex-pancyclic (rexpectively, m-edge-pancyclic) if every vertex (respectively, edge) 
lies on a cycle of every length from m to |V(G)|. In addition, a 3-vertex-pancyclic graph (respectively, 
3-edge-pancyclic graph) is called vertex-pancyclic (edge-pancyclic). It is clear that if a graph G is 
m-edge-pancyclic then it is m-vertex-pancyclic. The crossed cube [24], the twisted cube [25]，the möbius 
cube [44], and the recursive circulant graphs with some condition [6] are 4-edge-pancyclic. 
Since faults may occur to networks, the fault tolerance of networks is an important issue in designing 
network topologies. Let Fe  ⊂ E(G) (respectively, Fv  ⊂ V(G)) denote the faulty edges (respectively, the 
faulty vertices) in a graph G and let F = Fe ∪ Fv. Suppose that G − F is P, where P is m-pancyclic, 
pancyclic, vertex-pancyclic, m-vertex-pancyclic, edge-pancyclic, or m-edge-pancyclic. Then, we call G 
|F| fault-tolerant P. In addition, G is |F|-edge fault-tolerant P (respectively, |F|-vertex fault-tolerant P) if F 
= Fe (respectively, if F = Fv). Note that if G is |F| fault-tolerant P, then G is |F|-edge fault-tolerant P and 
|F|-vertex fault-tolerant P. The n-dimensional Möbius cube is (n − 2) fault-tolerant 4-pancyclic [32]. The

Let FFv (respectively, FFe) be the set of faulty vertices (respectively, faulty edges) in an n-dimensional 
folded hypercube FQn. In this project, we show that FQn − FFv − FFe contains a fault-free cycle with 
length at least 2n − 2|FFv| if |FFe| + |FFv| ≤ 2n − 4 and |FFe| ≤ n − 1, where n ≥ 3. 
A graph or multigraph G' is k-edge fault-tolerant [29] with respect to a graph G, denoted k-EFT(G), if 
every graph obtained by removing any k edges from G' contains G. Consider Qn, let Ea ={(b1b2…bn, 
1 2... nb b b )| b1b2…bn ∈ V(Qn) and 1 2... nb b b ∈ V(Qn)}. In [29], Harary and Hayes also showed that Qn ∪ Ea 
is an optimal 1-EFT(Qn). They have showed that Ea can replace all 2n−1 edges along dimension i in Qn, 
where i ∈ {1, 2, …, n}. In addition, it is easy to see that Qn ∪ Ea is actually isomorphic to FQn. Therefore, 
we have the following lemma. 
Lemma 1. FQn − Ei is isomorphic to Qn, i ∈ {1, 2, …, n}. 
In addition, the following lemma is also very useful to our proof. 
Lemma 2. [31] Let n ≥ 3 be an integer and Fv ⊂ V(Qn),(respectively, Fe ⊂ E(Qn) denote the set of faulty 
vertices (respectively, faulty edges) of Qn, where |Fe| ≤ n − 2 and |Fv| + |Fe| ≤ 2n − 4. There exists a cycle 
of length of at least 2n − 2|Fv| in Qn − Fe − Fv. 
By using these two lemmas and a very succinct method, we have proved the following theorem. 
Theorem 1. Let FFv ⊂ V(FQn) (respectively, FFe ⊂ E(FQn)) denote the faulty vertices (respectively, 
faulty edges) of FQn. There exists a cycle of length at least 2n − 2|FFv| in FQn − FFv − FFe if |FFe| ≤ n −1 
and |FFv| + |FFe| ≤ 2n − 4, where n ≥ 3. 
In addition, we have shown that every vertex in AQn lies on a fault-free cycle of every length from 3 to 
2n even if there are up to n − 1 link faults and every vertex in AQn lies on a fault-free cycle of every length 
from 4 to 2n even if there are up to 2n − 3 link faults. That is, we have shown that AQn is (n − 1)-edge 
fault-tolerant vertex-pancyclic and is (2n − 3)-edge fault-tolerant 4-vertex-pancyclic. We have used 
following lemmas. 
Lemma 3. [39] Let u, v ∈ V(AQn), where n ≥ 2. There exists a path P[u, v] of length l in AQn, where 
( , )
nAQ
d u v  ≤ l ≤ 2n − 1. 
Lemma 4. [39] Let u, v ∈ V(AQn), where n ≥ 2. There exists a Hamiltonian path P[u, v] in AQn − F, 
where F ⊂ E(AQn), if |F| ≤ 2n − 4. 
By using an inductive proof and above two lemmas, we have proved the following theorem: 
Theorem 2. Let F ⊂ E(AQn) denote the faulty edge set of AQn, where n ≥ 2. AQn − F is vertex-pancyclic 
6 
{1, 2, …, n − 1} and i ≠ j, u can not lie on a cycle of length 3. In addition, The result of Theorem 3 is also 
optimal since there are distributions of n edge faults over a AQn such that no fault-free cycle of length 
three can be found in the faulty AQn and there are distributions of 2n − 2 edge faults over a AQn such that 
no fault-free Hamiltonian cycle can be found in the faulty AQn.
