2TE bands move to higher frequencies, for there is more energy contained in the metal. In particular, static modes at
the point Γ are illustrated to explore the evanescent fields and related skin depths in the metal. In the limiting case
where ωp approaches to infinity, dispersive metals behave like perfect conductors, and the surface plasma frequency
ωsp goes to infinity as well, and therefore no surface plasmon modes exist at finite frequencies. Moreover, longitudinal
modes with eigenfrequency equal to ωp can also be obtained with the present approach. These modes correspond to
coherent oscillations at the bulk plasma frequency, and also to zero of the dielectric function. Finally, we consider the
effect of dissipation in terms of the Drude damping by developing the first-order perturbation analysis to correct the
eigenfrequencies.

for TM and TE modes, respectively, assuming that the fields vary harmonically in time with frequency ω as e−iωt.
The eigenmodes are solutions of the wave equations bound by some constraints. In this study, the periodicity of the
structure serves as a constraint to the wave equations. For periodic structures, it is sufficient to solve the problem on
one unit cell, along with the Bloch conditions
E(r+ ai) = eik·aiE(r), (3)
H(r+ ai) = eik·aiH(r), (4)
where k is the wave vector, and ai(i = 1, 2) are the lattice translation vectors.

4The system matrix A differs from B in two ways: (a) the eigenvalue Λ does not appear in the operator A, and
(b) the H field at the interface, being replaced by the interfacial variable R, does not appear in x. However, The
eigensystems (8) and (13) are equivalent to each other in the discrete sense that the eigenvalue Λ is the same for
both eigensystems, and the eigenvector x can be converted to the original eigenvector y, and vice versa. Nevertheless,
the eigensystem (13) has the great advantage of being a standard format that can be solved by standard eigenvalue
solvers. The detailed formulation of the interfacial operator approach is referred to Ref. [16].
Having obtained the solutions of (1) and (2) with the free-electron model (5), the contribution of Drude damping
can be considered by using the perturbation technique, applied with the interfacial operator approach. Ordinarily, the
collision frequency γ is small compared to the frequency ω such that γ ¿ ω. This suggests us to regard the solution
with damping based on the Drude model (6) as a perturbation to the undamped solution based on the free-electron
model. Here, we refer to the standard perturbation theory [20] to obtain the first-order correction of the eigenvalue.
First, the operator of the eigensystem Lφ = Λφ is split into two parts as
L = L0 + L1, (14)
where L0 is the operator of the undamped eigensystem. Assume the eigenvalue Λ and eigenfunction φ be expanded
as
Λ = Λ0 + Λ1 + · · · , (15)
φ = φ0 + φ1 + · · · , (16)
where Λ0 and φ0 are the eigenvalue and eigenfunction, respectively, of the operator L0. The correction of the
eigenfrequency ω1 is then given as
ω1 = c
(√
Λ0 + Λ1 −
√
Λ0
)
. (17)
Since the perturbed eigenvalues are in general complex, so are the perturbed eigenfrequencies. The imaginary part of
the eigenfrequency results in a decay factor of the electromagnetic field in the time domain, which tells the effect of
Drude damping.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Surface plasmons are waves that propagate along the surface of a conductor, due to collective oscillation of electric
charges coupled with the electromagnetic fields [21]. Because of the hybrid or mixing nature, surface plasmons are
also named surface plasmon polaritons [22]. Under suitable conditions, surface plasmons may appear at the interface
across which the dielectric constant changes sign. Ordinarily, it is the interface between a dielectric and a metal at
some frequency range. It is noted that the electromagnetic field is transverse in nature, for the electric field satisfies
the divergence free in a homogeneous medium (∇ · E = 0). On the other hand, the plasma or electron oscillation
is longitudinal in nature, which corresponds to zero of the dielectric function (ε = 0). Basically, the two motions
are not coupled with each other. But the presence of the interface gives the field a longitudinal component due to a
discontinuity of the dielectric function across the interface (∇ · E = −E · ∇ ln ε 6= 0) [23]. Therefore, the motions of
the electrons and the electromagnetic fields could be coupled at the interface. However, because the fields inside the
conductor have no longitudinal components to couple with the plasma oscillations, they rapidly decay away from the
interface. Therefore, surface plasmons are highly localized at the interface and evanescent otherwise. It is also noted
that only in the TE modes can surface plasmon modes be sustained. This is because in the TM modes the E field is
always tangential to the interface and continuous over there ([E]S = σ = 0), and therefore no surface charges exist
to support surface plasmons. On the other hand, in the TE modes the E field has a component across the interface,
which allows the surface charges to exist ([E]S = σ 6= 0).
Due to the binding of electrons, surface plasmons have larger momentums, or equivalently, larger wave numbers
than the light wave at the same frequency. Therefore, in order to excite surface plasmons by light, some coupling
mechanisms have to be introduced to cover the momentum deficit [23]. In the prism coupling technique, attenuated
total reflection is applied on a thin metal film to provide a larger wavenumber by reducing the wave speed. In
the grating coupling technique, the wavenumber is increased by the amount equal to the Fourier component of the
periodicity of the grating. Another way to excite the surface plasmons is using the lattice coupling to supply additional
dispersive modes. In this case, multiple scattering of the fields within the periodic structure is responsible for providing
extra momentums.

to resolve this feature.

The skin depths of surface plasmons modes could be very small. As the frequency approaches to the surface plasma
frequency ωsp, we have εd+εm ' 0. In fact, they can be much smaller than the skin depths of the metal, which can be
seen from Fig. 5. For comparison, the skin depth for the metal is given by δ ≡ 1/Im[k], where k = ω√ε/c = 2pi√ε/λ.

8C. Localized Surface Plasmons
On a metallic flat surface, surface plasmons can be widely extended along the surface. For a curved surface,
especially for an edged or cornered surface, surface plasmons may be confined in local regions. And for that reason,
they are termed as localized surface plasmons (LSP) [25]. In addition to SPP modes, LSP modes also appear but
with somewhat lower frequencies. This is more obvious for structures with sharp edges or corners, such as the square
or grid cylinders. Figure 6 shows the H field in magnitude for a typical LSP mode at the point Γ for a square array of
square metallic cylinders of half width w/a = 0.3 with ωpa/2pic = 1. Note that the eigenfrequency ωa/2pic = 0.5585 is
somewhat lower than the surface plasma frequency ωspa/2pic = 1/
√
2, and the mode structure is concentrated at local
areas instead of widely extended along the interface between the dielectric and the metal. Besides, the frequencies of
LSP modes may change somehow for different geometries, and the band widths are a little bit larger than those for
SPP modes. However, there is no clear cut between the modes of LSP and SPP. They belong to different branches
of the eigenmodes, possessing the same coupling mechanism but to different degrees. Discussions on localized surface
plasmons, in particular, on grating structures can be found in Refs. [26–28].
In order to measure the degree of localized behavior of surface plasmon modes, we define an extending factor fext
as follows
fext =
A′
A
=
L′
L
, (21)
where L is the total length of the interface, and L′ is the length of the portion of the interface where the magnitude of
the H field exceed a reference value, for example, 0.5, and A and A′ are the corresponding areas with unit extension
along the the offplane direction. For a typical LSP mode, fext is usually small. For example, fext = 0.33 for the LSP
mode in Fig. 6. On the other hand, fext has a larger value for a widely-extended SPP mode. In Fig. 5, the SPP
mode has an extending factor fext = 0.67.
D. Surface Charges and Polarization Currents
Surface charge oscillation is the essential mechanism that supports surface plasmons. For a source-free problem
(ρf = 0), surface charges come from discontinuity of the transverse electric field across the interface between the
dielectric and the metal. From Gauss’s law, we have ρb = ρ = ε0∇ · E. For the TE modes, in particular, the
transverse electric field components can be obtained from the H field,
Ex =
i
ωε
∂Hz
∂y
, Ey = − i

Figure 7 shows the transverse electric fields in vectors along with the electric charge strengths in color for a typical
surface plasmon mode with ωa/2pic = 0.7047. Note that in the inset the electric field lines flow along the interface,
whose nodal points (Ex = 0) located at the points where variation of the H field along the interface (the x-direction)
attains its local maximum value. It is also obvious from the above equation that in the strict insides of the dielectric
and the metal, the electric charges are identically zero. Therefore, all charges appear on the metal-dielectric interface.
The linear motion of the charges in the metal cause the polarization currents Jp when the polarization field P
changes. According to the free-electron model (5), we have

Figure 8 shows the polarization currents in vectors and their strengths in color for the same surface plasmon mode in
Fig. 7. Note that the polarization currents, flowing in the inside of the metal, also concentrate on the interface, and
are 90 degrees out of phase to the electric fields, as compared to Fig. 7.
E. Band Flattening
The most distinguished feature of band structure for plasmonic crystals is the flatten bands [12, 29] associated with
SPP modes of small band widths, which is due to strong electron-photon coupling that reduces the band dispersion
10
FIG. 8: (Color online) The polarization currents in vectors (the inset) and their strengths in color for a typical surface plasmon
mode with ωa/2pic = 0.7047.
origin of this broadening could be explained as effective mode interaction due to geometry of the interface. In
particular, for thin grid structures, interaction from both the normal and the lateral directions of the interface further
lifts the degeneracy, making the bands spread even more widely. Figure 10 shows the band structure for a square
array of grid metallic cylinders of thickness t/a = 0.1 with ωpa/2pic = 1. On the other hand, for thick grid structures,
there may be a balance between band flattening and band broadening. As a result, a plasmonic band gap between
surface plasmon modes may occur around ωsp, although it is usually small. Figure 11 shows the band structure for
a square array of grid metallic cylinders of thickness t/a = 0.3 with ωpa/2pic = 1. A plasmonic band gap with a
gap-midgap ratio 3.9% and the midgap frequency 0.738 is shown in the figure.

which reveals that the energy may increase with increasing the plasma frequency.
It is natural for us to consider that the cutoff behavior is analogous to that in the conventional waveguides.
However, the origin of the cutoff behavior in the TM modes for the metallic structure is very different from that of the
conventional waveguide. In the latter, the cutoff frequency originates from sustenance of the transverse oscillations
[33], while in the former, the electric fields are identically zero inside the perfect conductors, or exponentially decay
inside the dispersive metals. In particular, we consider the TM modes at the symmetric point Γ. If the zero-frequency
solution (without a cutoff frequency) is allowed in the structure, the E field should be constant everywhere outside the
metal. By the continuity of the E field at the metal boundary for perfect conductors ([E]S = 0), this constant must
be zero, resulting in a trivial solution. For dispersive metals, another continuity condition of the E field at the metal
boundary ([∂E/∂n]S = 0) excludes the possibility of a constant solution outside the metal and exponentially decay
inside. In either case, the TM modes with zero frequency do not exist, making appearance of the cutoff frequency.
On the other hand, the cutoff behavior is not observed in the TE modes for metallic structures. This is because
constant solutions outside the metal (and zero inside) with zero frequency are allowed in the structure without violating
the boundary condition for perfect conductors ([∂H/∂n]S = 0). For dispersive metals, the zero-frequency solution is
also valid, for the interface condition (12) allows a discontinuity in the normal derivative of the H field across the
metal boundary, which is necessary for a solution to be constant outside the metal and exponentially decay inside.
H. Static Modes
Static modes are zero-frequency solutions mentioned in the preceding subsection. Figure 13 shows the static mode at
the point Γ for a square array of circular metallic cylinders of radius r/a = 0.3 with ωpa/2pic = 1. They are eigenmodes
correspond to the long wavelength limit, also the electrostatic field for the TM modes or the magnetostatic field for

(28), and most important, the surface plasma frequency ωsp, through the relation (18). Besides, the surface plasmon
band structures are no longer scale invariant because of the appearance of ωp. That means solutions with different
ωp cannot be scaled with each other. Figure 15 shows the band structure for a square array of grid metallic cylinders
of thickness t/a = 0.1 with ωpa/2pic = 2. Note that the detailed structure is different from the case of ωpa/2pic = 1
in Fig. 10, although the overall pattern is similar. Besides, surface plasma frequency ωsp switches to a higher value
ωspa/2pic =
√
2.
As ωp increases to a higher value, the energy density of electromagnetic field (28) becomes larger, and the group
velocities of surface plasmon polaritons becomes even smaller. In another aspect, dispersive metals behave more like

Static and longitudinal modes are two unique features in the TE modes for metallic structures. In a sense, they are
dual to each other; static modes have constant solutions outside the metal, while longitudinal modes have constants
inside. In another aspect, for example, in one-dimensional layered structures, both the static mode and the longitudinal
mode eventually converge to two surface plasmon modes at sufficiently large off-line wave numbers. These unique
features originate from the fact that the dielectric function lies inside the operator for the TE modes (2). On the other
hand, they do not exist in the TM modes because the interface condition for the E field ([∂E/∂n]S = 0) excludes such
solutions. That also means surface charges are responsible for static and longitudinal modes as they are for surface
plasmon modes.
K. Drude Damping
Using the perturbation technique, we can study the effect of Drude damping, provided that the collision frequency
γ is small compared to the eigenfrequency ω. The imaginary part of the first-order correction ω1 in Eq. (17) gives rise
a decay factor eIm[ω1]t of the mode structure in the time domain. Note that Im [ω1] is negative for e−iωt dependance
of the fields. Figure 19 shows the imaginary part of ω1 of the first few bands for a square array of square metallic
cylinders of half width w/a = 0.3 with ωpa/2pic = 1 and γ/ωp = 0.01. In general, Im [ω1] is smaller than the collision
frequency γ about one order of magnitude. Even bands have larger dissipation at the zone center, while odd bands
have larger dissipation at the band edges. Moreover, the dissipation becomes even smaller for higher bands.
