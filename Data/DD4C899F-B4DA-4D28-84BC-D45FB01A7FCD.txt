2摘要
靈芝（Ganoderma lucidum）是中藥上常用的一種藥用真菌，根據文獻指出，其所生產
之胞外多醣體具有抗腫瘤之療效。本研究主要利用添加油脂於液態醱酵培養靈芝以提昇其
菌體量及多醣體生產，由結果顯示於培養時添加 2%之玉米油，經由 13 天培養後，其菌體
量及胞外多醣體產量分別可達 12.9 g/L 及 1.038g/L。於不同 pH値下添加油脂培養觀察其菌
體型態，並推論出油脂添加所扮演之角色，此外，利用實驗數據回歸分析，得知添加油脂
於液態醱酵培養其菌體量以及多醣體產量之提昇效應。於單一碳源培養中，由回歸方程式
可預測基質消耗與產物生成之關係，且由數値結果可更進一步瞭解於液態培養靈芝油脂添

Abstract
Ganoderma lucidum is one of the most famous traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. It was
reported that polysaccharide isolated from fruiting body and the mycelia culture of G. lucidum
has immunomodulating and anti-tumor activity. The object of this study was to enhance mycelia
and polysaccharide production in submerged culture by addition of oils. The effect of corn oil
addition on mycelium growth and polysaccharide productions in the medicinal mushroom
Ganoderma lucidum was studied. The results showed that when a level of 2% corn oil was added
at the beginning of culture, the biomass and polysaccharide productions reached a maximum of
12.9 and 1.038 g/L, respectively, during 13-day cultivation. The pH variation along with
morphology observation in culture provided an indirect inference to the promotional effect of oil
addition. Moreover, a curve fitting analysis was carried out to assay the elevated effect on
biomass and exopolysaccharide productions in oil added culture. The experimental data of
substrates consumption and products formation in culture with oil addition were predicted
through the fitting equations obtained in single carbon source culture. The numerical results
further clarified the stimulatory effects of oil addition in G. lucidum culture.

計畫成果自評
本研究以添加油脂探討其對靈芝生產胞外多醣體之提昇效應，定量式實驗分析模式以期能
更深入瞭解油脂在此醱酵過程中所扮演之角色，為產物誘導者或僅為碳源之提供者。主要
重點為提出在添加玉米油於液態醱酵培養基中培養靈芝，對菌體及胞萬多醣體產量接有所
提升，此計畫之主要成果為提出此一實驗數據回歸分析方式，並得知油脂在此醱酵過程中
主要係做為碳源之提供者，而其對整體胞外多醣之提昇，主要是因為菌絲體同時可代謝二
種碳源，因此其多醣產率被提昇。根據菌絲體型態之分析，亦證明油脂以油滴形狀分佈在
菌球體之週邊，故可適度提供碳源，並延長了菌球體生長之時間。此研究方法為第一次具
於文獻中，可提供未來之研究者一個極方便之分析醱酵結果之方式。

A high-performance liquid chromatographic HPLC method for the
determination of polyamines in human urine has been devel-
oped. This method was based on a pre-column derivatization with
dansyl chloride (Dns-Cl). The derivatives were separated on a 
Bondapak C18 column (250mm×4.6mm, i.d. 10m) eluted with
methanol anddistilledwaterwithone-step linear gradient. The col-
umn eluate was monitored by ﬂuorescence detection (EX 370nm,
EM 506nm), The within-assay precision of the study (CV) was
putrescine (PUT) 2.88%, spermidine (SPD) 2.94%, spermine (SP)
1.17%; while the between-assay precision (CV) were PUT 2.66%,
SPD 3.06%, SP 2.79%; the recovery was greater than 97%. The detec-
tion limit for PUT, SPD and SP was 0.05, 0.08 and 0.06nmol/ml,
respectively.
In contrast to the other studies, in this paper, sample or
polyaminederivativesdonotneedorganic solvent (suchas ethanol)
extraction, vacuumevaporationandother condensationprocedure.
It is a simple, rapid, sensitive, efﬁcientmethodwhich canbeapplied
for the determination of polyamines in nearly all biologic tissues
and body ﬂuid such as serum and cerebrospinal ﬂuid.

For investigating the feasibility of using nano-carbon black (NCB)
as an immunoassay marker, a process to construct NCB was ﬁrst
developed. Carbon particles were ground under a stir ball mill with
the addition of a surfactant (provided by prof. C.T. Hsu in Industrial
Technology Research Institute, Taiwan, ROC). The particle size of
NCB collected was measured by a particle size analyzer (BIC 90
Plus) and was around 84.9nm. In addition, the NCB was employed
to label the antibodyagainst humanserumalbumin (anti-HSA), and
a gel ﬁltration was conducted to separate the NCB-antiHSA from
the unlabeled one. The obtained NCB-antiHSA was used to analyze
HSA in a competitive immunochromatographic test (ICT). With the
color intensity revealed in the ICT as the objective function, the
optimal conjugate mass ratio of anti-HSA to NCB was around 4,
giving a color intensity of 298,200. The ICT strip was capable of
performing a competitive assay for HSA within a linear range from
2.5 to 30g/ml.
