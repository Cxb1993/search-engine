antiferroelectric liquid crystal material, 
MHPOBC, have equal chiral chain length, but 
the chiral chain was more flexibility due to the 
number of ether linkages. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Characterization of the materials 
The chemical structures for intermediates 
and target materials were analyzed by nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy using a JEOL 
EX-500 FT-NMR spectrometer.  The purity 
was checked by thin-layer chromatography and 
further confirmed by elemental analysis using a 
PERKIN-ELMER 2400 spectrometer. Transition 
temperatures and phase transition enthalpies of 
the materials were determined by differential 
scanning calorimetry using a PERKIN-ELMER 
DSC7 calorimeter at running rates of 5  min℃ -1.  
Mesophases were principally identified by 
microscopic textures of the materials 
sandwiched between two glass plates under 
crossed polarizing microscope using a NIKON 
MICROPHOT-FXA in conjunction with a 
Mettler FP82 hot stage.  
The physical properties of ferroelectric 
phase for the materials were measured in 
homogeneously aligned cells purchased from E. 
H. C. Co. Japan. The magnitude of spontaneous 
polarization (Ps) was measured by a triangular 
wave method [12]. The measurement of optical 
transmittance versus applied electric field was 
conducted by using a He-Ne laser (5mW, 
632.8nm) as a probe beam [13,14]. The optical 
transmittance of the probe beam passing though 
the cell between crossed polarizers, whose axes 
were parallel and perpendicular to the smectic 
layer normal. was detected by a photodiode. The 
signals were detected by using HP54502A 
digital oscilloscope. The voltage applied to the 
cell was produced by the arbitrary wave-from 
generator (AG1200) and amplified by a 
homemade power preamplifier. 
2.2. Preparation of materials 
The staring chiral material, (S)-propylene 
oxide was purchased from Aldrich chemical 
company, United State with optical purity 
greater than 99%. Thin layer chromatography 
was performed with TLC sheets coated with 
silica; spots were detected by UV irradiation. 
Silica gel (MN kieselgel 60, 70~230 mesh) was 
used for column chromatography. Anhydrous 
organic solvents, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and 
tetranhydrofuran (THF), were purified by 
treatment with CaH2 and LiAlH4, respectively, 
and distilled before use. 
The synthetic processes of the target 
compounds were carried out as outlined in 
Scheme. The detail procedures for the syntheses 
of the compounds MEPCPmBC (m=8-12) are 
described as follows. 
2.2.1 4-methoxycarbonyloxybenzoic acid, 2  
To a solution of sodium hydroxide (7.5g, 
175 mmole) in water (200ml) which was 
maintained at 0 , 4℃ -hydroxybenzoic acid (9g, 
65 mmole) was added with vigorous stirring, 
methyl chloroformate (10g, 105 mmole) was 
then added slowly to the resulting suspension 
which was maintained at 0-5℃. The resulting 
slurry was stirred for a further 4 hours and 
brought to PH = 5 by the addition of conc. 
hydrochloric acid and water (1:1). The 
voluminous precipitate was filtered off and 
recrystallized from ethanol to give a white solid. 
84% yields of compounds 2 were obtained. M.p. 
173-176 .℃ The chemical shifts of compound 2 
in 1H-NMR (500MHz, d6-DMSO) spectrum 
are：δ(ppm) 3.65-3.63 (s, 3H, OCH3, J=6.8Hz), 
7.17-7.15 (d, 2H, ArH, J=8.5Hz), 7.80-7.15 (d, 
2H, ArH, J=8.6Hz). 
2.2.2 
(S)-1-methyl-2-[(2’-methoxy)ethoxy]eth
anol, 3  
2-Methoxyethanol (24g, 315mmole) and 
sodium hydroxide (0.1 g, 2.5 mmol) were heated 
under reflux for 2 h and the mixture cooled to 
room temperature. (S)-Propylene oxide (6g, 105 
mmol) was added dropwise and the refluxing 
continued overnight. The resultant mixture was 
filtered, and excess 2-methoxyethanol removed 
under vacuum. The pure product thus obtained 
was distilled under high vacuum, and was 
obtained. 70% yields of compound 3 were 
obtained. B.p. 88℃/22mmHg. The chemical 
shifts of compound 3 in 1H-NMR (400MHz, 
d6-DMSO) spectrum are：δ(ppm) 1.13-1.14 (d, 
3H, HOC*HCH3, J=6.4Hz), 3.20 (s, 1H, -OH), 
3.26-3.50 (m, 2H, -C*HCH2O-), 3.30 (s, 1H, 
-OCH3), 3.53-3.58 (t, 2H, -OCH2CH2O-, 
J=4.9Hz), 3.61-3.74 (m, 2H, -OCH2CH2O-), 
3.96-4.00 (m, 1H, -COOC*HCH3). 
2.2.3 (R)-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)propyl 
4-(methoxycarbonyloxy) benzoate, 4 
A solution of diethyl azodicarboxylate 
(DEAD, 3.04g, 17.5mmole) and compound 2 
(3.76g, 17.5mmole) in 10ml anhydrous THF was 
added, drop by drop, to a solution of triphenyl 
phosphine (Ph3P, 3.715 g, 17.5mmole) and 
compound 3 (2.1g, 16mmole) in 10ml anhydrous 
THF at room temperature with vigorous stirring. 
The reaction soon started. After the mixture had 
been kept standing overnight at room 
temperature, the triphenylphosphine oxide was 
remove by filtration. THF was removed by 
vacuum. After work-up procedure, the products 
were isolated by column chromatography over 
silica gel (70-230 mesh) using ethyl acetate / 
hexane = (1：2) as eluent to give a colorless 
liquid. 52% yield of compound 4 was obtained. 
The chemical shifts of compounds 4 in 1H-NMR 
(500MHz, CDCl3) spectra are ： δ (ppm) 
seen that the Ps values decreased when the 
achiral terminal alkyl chain length ‘m’ was 
ascended at the same tempture bellow the Curie 
point Tc. The maximum Ps values of compounds 
MEPCPmBC (m=8-12) are in the range of 14-16 
nC/cm2. 
The materials were filled into 5µm thickness 
homogeneous cells for the apparent tilt angle 
measurement. The apparent tilt angle for 
compounds MEPCPmBC (m=8-12) were 
determined as a function of temperature on 
cooling to the SmC* range. In general, the 
apparent tilt angle rose from 0° at the phase 
transition and gradually saturated with the 
decreasing temperature. Figure 4 showed that the 
tile angles were small at the SmA*-SmC* phase 
transition. As the temperature cooling down, the 
apparent tilt angle increased drastically and 
finally have the maximum values of about 
20-26。. It was found that there has no any 
signification correlation of the apparent tilt angle 
values to the variations of alkyl chain length. 
The temperature dependence of the 
dielectric constant ε’ was measured at 100Hz in 
a 25µm homogeneous cell, aligned with results 
depicted in Figure 5. During cooling, the ε’ in 
the SmA* phase was small, increasing rapidly at 
the SmA* to SmC* transition. The characteristic 
point corresponding to the SmA*-SmC* 
transition was easily seen in the figure. The great 
enhancement of the dielectric constant on 
cooling from SmA* to SmC* was due to the 
contribution of the Goldstone mode [16]. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We have synthesized a series of liquid 
crystalline compounds MEPCPmBC (m=8-12) 
derived from 
(S)-1-methyl-2-[(2’-methoxy)ethoxy]ethanol 
having two ether linkages in a chiral chain, 
possess ferroelectric SmC* phase. As 
comparison with the antiferroelectric liquid 
crystals, MHPOBC, which have a similar 
structure on the hydrocarbon tailed analogs of 
the same number of atoms. Tthe chiral chain 
with ether linkages, ferroelectric SmC* phase as 
well as antiferroelectric SmCA* phase were 
observed. This phenomenon can be explained by 
the increased flexibility of the tails due to the 
higher free rotation of the C-O bonds. The 
studies of switching behavior and electrical 
response displayed similar results for all 
materials. The maximum Ps values were in the 
range of 14-16 nCcm-2, and the maximum 
apparent tilt angle reached 26o for the SmC* 
phase.

Abstract 
Two series of novel chiral liquid crystals, 
2F3H(m=8-12) and 2H3F(m=8-12), with 2- or 
3-fluorophenyl moieties in the core of the 
mesogen, derived from optically active 
(S)-1-methyl-2-[(2’-methoxy)ethoxy]ethanol, 
were prepared for the investigation of 
mesomorphic properties. The results showed that 
2F3H(m=8-12) series, exhibited the phases 
sequence of SmA*-SmC*, while the 2F3H(m=9) 
posesses an additional SmX*. In the 
2H3F(m=8-12) series, 2H3F(m=8, 9) series with 
shorter alkyl chain displayed an enantiotropic 
phase sequence of SmA*-SmCA* while 
2H3F(m=10-12) series with longer alkyl chain 
exhibited enantiotropic phase sequence of 
SmA*-SmC*. The physical properties such as 
switching current, spontaneous polarization, tilt 
angle, dielectric constant and electro-optical 
response for the materials in the SmC* and 
SmCA* phase were measured. The relationship 
between the position of the fluoro substituent 
and mesomorphic properties are discussed in 
detail. 
 
Keywords: enantiotropic, switching current, 
dielectric constant, antiferroelectric. 
 
1. Introduction 
Since the discovery of ferroelectric [1] and 
antiferroelectric [2] mesogens, much attention 
has been paid to synthesize the chiral materials 
for investigation the relationships between their 
chemical structure and physical properties. It is 
generally acknowledged that the mesognic core 
of molecule plays an important role in the 
formation of mesophases. Thus, the use of 
different lateral substitution in the core of the 
mesogen has been designed to study the effect 
by Coates et al. [3]. The experimental results 
indicated that incorporation of lateral substituent 
in the core of the mesogen reduced the 
occurrence of higher ordered phases and provide 
materials with wider temperature range of 
smetric C phase and lower melting points. 
Moreover, introduced fluorine atom as a lateral 
substituents moieties has been widespread 
application in designed of liquid crystal 
materials [4-11] due to the lateral fluoro 
substituent has smaller size and higher 
electronegativity [12].  
    Our previous studies on a homologous 
series of chiral liquid crystals, 2H3H (m=8-12), 
shows that all of the chiral materials displayed a 
mesophase sequence of 
I-SmA*-SmC*-SmX*-Cr.[13]. In order to 
understand further the dependence of the 
mesogenic behavior on the lateral fluoro 
substituent based on 2H3H (m=8-12), two series 
of chiral liquid crystals, 2F3H(m=8-12) and 
2H3F(m=8-12), with 2- or 3-fluorophenyl 
moieties in the core of the mesogen were 
synthesized for investigation. The general

4’-alkoxybiphenyl-4-carboxylates, 2H3F 
(m=8~12) 
Theses materials were prepared in an analogous 
manner of 2F3H(m=8-12). The yields were 
48-69%. The chemical shifts for material 
2H3F(m=10), as an example, in 1H-NMR 
(500MHz, CDCl3) spectrum are: δ(ppm) 
0.88-0.91 (m, 3H, -CH2CH3), 1.37-1.38 (d, 3H,

1H, ArH, J=8.8 Hz), 8.238.25 (d, 2H, ArH, 
materials, 2H3F(m=9-12) with  Ps values are in 
range 9-13 nC cm-2. As comparison of 
spontaneous polarization for the 
nonfluoro-substituted material 2H3H(m=10) and 
fluoro-substituted materials 2F3H(m=10), 
2H3F(m=10) are presented in figure 8. It was 
seen that the 2H3H(m=10) had higher Ps values 
than 2F(m=10), 3F(m=10) at the same 
temperature bellow Curie point. This may be due 
to the compensating effect of the lateral fluoro 
substituents with respect to the Ps. The fluoro 
substituent points affected the transverse and 
longitude of dipole moment of the molecule and 
away from the direction of the chiral methyl 
group, hence made diminishing the observed Ps 
[29]. 
The materials were filled into 2 µm 
homogeneous cells for the apparent tilt angle 
measurement. The apparent tilt angles were 
determined as a function of temperature on 
cooling to the SmC* or SmCA* range. In figure 9 
shows the maximum apparent tilt angle of 
materials, 2F3H(m=8-12), are about 21-29。, and 
in figure 10, the materials, 3H3F(m=8-12) with 
maximum apparent tilt angle are about 21-30。. 
As comparison of optical tilt angle for the 
nonfluoro-substituted material 2H3H(m=10) and 
fluoro-substituted materials 2F3H(m=10), 
2H3F(m=10) are presented in figure 11. It was 
seen that materials 2F3H(m=10),2H3F(m=10) 
with fluoro substituent have higher tilt angle
 
than 
the material 2H3H(m=10), suggesting that fluoro 
substitent in general enhances the apparent title 
angle for the materials. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We have successful synthesis two series chiral 
liquid crystals materials with lateral 
fluoro-subsitituted derived from optically active 
(S)-1-methyl-2-[(2’-methoxy) ethoxy]ethanol, 
for investigation the relationships between 
lateral fluoro-subsitituted and mesomorphic 
properties. The results demonstrate that

materials at 2-position favor the formation of 
SmC* phase, but at 3-position favor formation of 
SmCA* phase in shorter alkyl chain members

electrooptical devices is well documented [2-4]. 
Commercially available ferroelectric liquid 
crystals must possess broad SmC* phase range 
(over room temperature). In order to depress the 
phase transition temperatures, multiple ether 
linkages were put into the achiral moiety in the 
past research [5-8]. The depression has been 
attributed to the increased flexibility of the 
achiral moiety due to the number of C-O bonds 
[5]. 
Our previous studies on a series of compounds 
derived from (S)-propylene oxide possess the 
ferroelectric SmC* phase with wide temperature 
ranges [9]. Thus, in order to depress the SmC* 
phase ranges, we introduce ether group into the 
chiral moiety and fluoro or chloro substitution 
into the phenyl ring of the core in this study. The 
general structural formula of the compounds is 
depicted below.

2.1 Characterization of the materials 
The chemical structures for intermediates and 
target materials were analyzed by nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy using a JEOL 
EX-400 FT-NMR spectrometer.  The purity 
was checked by thin-layer chromatography and 
further confirmed by elemental analysis using a 
PERKIN-ELMER 2400 spectrometer. Transition 
temperatures and phase transition enthalpies of 
the materials were determined by differential 
scanning calorimetry using a PERKIN-ELMER 
DSC7 calorimeter at running rates of 5  min℃ -1.  
Mesophases were principally identified by 
microscopic textures of the materials 
sandwiched between two glass plates under 
crossed polarizing microscope using a NIKON 
MICROPHOT-FXA in conjunction with a 
Mettler FP82 hot stage and Mettler Toledo FP90 
central processor. 
The physical properties of ferroelectric phase for 
the materials were measured in  5μm 
homogeneously aligned cells purchased from E. 
H. C. Co. Japan. The magnitude of spontaneous 
polarization (Ps) was measured by a triangular 
wave method [10]. The measurement of optical 
transmittance versus applied electric field was 
conducted by using a He-Ne laser (5mW, 
632.8nm) as a probe beam [11, 12]. The optical 
transmittance of the probe beam passing though 
the cell between crossed polarizers, whose axes 
were parallel and perpendicular to the smectic 
layer normal. was detected by a photodiode. The 
signals were detected by using HP54502A 
digital oscilloscope. The voltage applied to the 
cell was produced by the arbitrary wave-from 
generator (AG1200) and amplified by a 
home-made power preamplifier. 
 
2.2. Preparation of materials 
The chiral starting materials, (S)-propylene 
oxide, and 2-methoxyethanol were where from 
Fluka Co. Chem., Japan, with purity greater than 
99%. Thin layer chromatography was performed 
with TLC sheets coated with silica; spots were 
detected by UV irradiation. Silica gel (MN 
kieselgel 60, 70-230 mesh) was used for column 
chromatography. Anhydrous organic solvents, 
dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and tetrahydrofuran 
(THF), were purified by treatment with CaH2 
and LiAlH4, respectively, and distilled before 
use. 
The synthetic processes of the target materials I 
(8-12), II (8-12) and III (8-12) were carried out 
as outlined in Scheme 1. The detailed procedures 
for the syntheses of the materials are described 
as follows. 
Scheme 1. 
 
2.2.1. 
4’-methoxycarbonyloxybiphenyl-4-carboxylic 
acid, І-2 [13]. 
To a solution of sodium hydroxide (2.52g, 63 
mmole) in water (70ml) which was maintained 
at 0℃ , 4’-hydroxybiphenyl-4-carboxylic acid 
(5g, 23.4 mmole) was added with vigorous 
stirring. Methyl chloroformate (3.58g, 38 mmole) 
was then added slowly to the resulting 
suspension which was maintained at 0-5℃. The 
resulting slurry was stirred for a further 4 hours 
and brought to PH 5 by the addition of conc. 
hydrochloric acid and water (1:1). The 
voluminous precipitate was filtered off and 
recrystallized from ethanol to give a white solid. 
88.9％yield of the compound, I-2 was obtained. 
1H-NMR (500MHz, d6-DMSO): δ(ppm) 3.84 
(s, 3H, OCH3), 7.35~7.37 (d, 2H, ArH, J=8.5 
Hz), 7.78~7.81 (t, 4H, ArH, J=8.5 Hz), 
8.01~8.03 (d, 2H, ArH, J=8.5 Hz). 
 
2.2.2 
(S)-1-methyl-2-[(2’-methoxy)ethoxy]ethanol, 
І-3  
2-Methoxyethanol (24g, 315mmole) and sodium 
hydroxide (0.1g, 25mmole) were mixed and 
heated under reflux for 2 hours. After cooling to 
room temperature, (S)-propylene oxide (6g, 
105mmole) was added dropwise and the 
refluxed resumed overnight. The resultant 
mixture was filtered. Excess 2-methoxyethanol 
was removed under vacuum. The resinous mass, 
thus obtained was distilled under high vacuum. 
70 ％ yield of pure product was obtained.

chain is increased. In the series II, all 
compounds exhibit SmA* phase. Compounds II 
(10-12) exhibit additional SmC* phase. As is 
evident from this figure, the clearing point is 
decreased when the achiral chain is increased. In 
the series III, the shorter chain compounds 
(m=8-10) of the third series III (8-12) displayed 
no liquid crystal phase while the longer chain 
compounds (m=11, 12) exhibited SmA* phase. 
With the increasing achiral terminal chain 
lengths, m, the clearing point decrease. 
Table 1 
Table 2 
Table 3 
Figure 1 is a chart of mesophases obtained for 
the compounds I (11), II (11) and III (11). It can 
be seen that introducing a fluoro substitution into 
the phenyl ring of core could depress the 
clearing temperature and SmA*-SmC* transition 
temperatures. However, the compound with 
lateral 3-chloro substitution in the phenyl ring of 
core shows no SmC* phase. 
Figure 1 
 
3.2 Dielectric constant (ε’) 
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of 
the dielectric constantsε’ for the material I (11) 
measured at 100Hz in 25µm homogeneous cells. 
Theε ’ in the SmA* phase are small. With 
decreasing temperature to the SmC* phase at 
approximately 80℃ , the dielectric constants 
increase rapidly due to the contribution of the 
Goldstone mode[14]. 
Figure 2 
 
3.3 Electro-optical responses  
The electro-optical responses were obtained 
under crossed polarizers, with the axes of 
polarizers and analyser parallel and 
perpendicular, respectively, to the smectic layer 
normal in a 5 µm homogeneously aligned cell. 
The responses are critically dependent on the 
temperature and applied frequency. Figure 3 
illustrates a typical example of the 
electro-opticalresponse of transmittance vs. 
electric field on applying a field of triangular 
waveform, measured in the SmC* phase of 
material II (12) at 66℃ and 10Hz of applied 
frequency. A thresholdless, V-shaped switching 
curve was obtained in the ferroelectric phase of 
all the materials. The maximum transmittance 
value increases as the temperature decreases, as 
reported by Seomum et al. [15]. A slightly 
normal ferroelectric hysteresis was also observed; 
however, the hysteresis disappeared with 
variation of temperature and applied frequency, 
similar to our previous observations in other 
series of materials [16–18]. 
Figure 3 
 
3.4 Spontaneous polarization (Ps) 
Spontaneous polarization Ps was determined in 
LC cells made of ITO coated glass whose 
surface had been treated with a parallel 
alignment of polyimide. Spontaneous 
polarization values were taken after slow cooling 
to the SmC* temperature range. The temperature 
dependence of Ps of materials I (9-12) and II 
(10-12) was measured at 20 Hz of applied 
frequency and 5V of applied voltage in 5 µm LC 
cells, and is illustrated in figures 4 and 5, 
respectively. The Ps values depend on 
temperature and exhibit maxima. The first 
increase in Ps at lower temperature below Tc can 
be attributed to decreased thermal motion at the 
lower temperature. After maximum Ps is reached, 
a gradual decrease in temperature resulted in a 
decreasing Ps, which might be due to 
crystallization [19]. The maximum Ps values for 
series I and series II were in the range of 2.8–10 
nCcm-2 and 3.2-8.3 nCcm-2.

3.5 title angle (θ) 
Samples were sandwich-packed in 5 µm thick 
homogeneously aligned cells for the apparent tilt 
angle measurement. Figure 6 shows the tilt 
angles of compounds I (9-12) rise from 0° at 
SmA*-SmC* phase transition temperature and 
reach maximum of about 16.5-21.5° in 
decreasing temperature. Figure 7 shows that the 
maximum tilt angles of compounds II (10-12) 
are in the range of 17.0-23.0º. Figure 8 shows 
the temperature dependence of apparent title 
angle (θ) for materials I (11) and II (11). The 
maximum title angles values of material I (11) is 
20.5°, while that of material II (11) is 21°.

4. Conclusion 
We have demonstrated that introduce ether group 
into the chiral moiety could depress the phase 
transition temperature. The compounds with 
lateral 3-fluoro substitution in the phenyl ring of 
core could depress clearing temperature and 
phase transition temperature. However, the 
compounds with 3-chloro substitution in the 
phenyl ring of core could depress the formation 
of SmC* phase.

from this figure, the clearing point is decreased 
when the achiral chain is increased. In the series 
III, the shorter chain compounds (m=8-10) of the 
third series III (8-12) displayed no liquid crystal

be attributed to decreased thermal motion at the

a gradual decrease in temperature resulted in a

大會在 7/30/2008 舉行開幕式後由第一位 keynote speaker Clark 教授演講
以”Liquid crystals and origin of life: End-to-End staking and condensation of 
complementary Nanoscale DNA”開始了學術會議的演講。他提到 Nanoscale DNA 
在 6-20 單位配對上約 2-７nm 上可以展現呈現 N*及柱狀液晶相。結構上的研究
顯示這些液晶相尾對尾的堆疊產生之規則性，因而推論線性高分子形狀的 DNA
在早期是依液晶相的生成方式複製。此次會議有相當多有關生物化學與液晶之間
的學術性報告。 
第二位 Keynote speaker 為韓國三星 LCD 研究中心的 Souk 博士的演講，主
題為”Limiting factors and success factors of LCD-how to move forward in the 
competing future display world?”他認為新的顯示器如 OLED，軟性顯示器以及電子
快速應答 (fast switching speeds)、雙穩定性 (bistalility)、高解析度及極佳的視角，
目前在商用顯示器上已被應用在 Video camera，Head-mounted projection以及 Spatial 
light modulator 等方面的設計。為了在應用上有更一步的發展，英國 Hird 教授在
誘電性混合液晶的主材料上進行分子的改型設計將具有較大結構的分子如
-Si(CH3)3 ，-C(CH3)3等放在分子的尾端以降低尾端分子間的作用力，以致於不會
在由 SmA 冷卻至 SmC 時常出現的 layer shrinkage，進而有利於行成誘電性液晶具
有良好配向之 Bookshelf 狀態。日本 Maruyama 教授提出他們最近發展的誘電性顯
示器，認為”polymer-stalilized  V-shaped FLC display(PSV-LCD)”將為新世代最具
潛力的顯示器。利用添加微量之 Photo-curable 單體在 FLC 混合液晶裡，然後照光
產生 Polymer nano-structure stalilizing 的 FLC 配向及利用施加 AC 電壓使產生單光
軸方向以避免 Zigzag defect 的技術，改良傳統的 SSFLC 至具 V-shaped switching 的
特性。 
液晶材料界的大師 Goodby 演講主題為”Supermolecular and Supramolecular 
liquid crystals”，他認為直至目前為止液晶設計大部分著重在為顯示器使用的低
分子或高分子量之高分子材料。Supermolecular 及 Supramolecular 液晶將因存在多
種的特性在奈米科學材料及生物界引起更大迴響。他從早期低分子的設計開始介
紹。化學分子以三苯環且具有雙氟化取代基因具有低粘度、負介電性、低融點、
低導電性為最佳的誘電性液晶混合材料的主材料。為解決配向問題，液晶分子設
計在分子的尾端加入較大之分子以降低分子間的作用力減少在 SmA 相中之分子
的 layer shrinkage 使得進入 SmC 相產生缺陷。接下來，他介紹近似蛋白質的一級
結構之線性液晶高分子。線性高分子由二個或二個以上的單體所聚合成。高分子
將因單體形狀，分子鏈間的作用力而產生自組裝之堆疊。此類材料設計目標為取
代斷骨用鈦合金。較複雜的巨大分子為以 Dendrimer 為主體所發展出來如
Dichotomous dentrimers 可透過自組裝形成巨大的分子，借由分子的設計可以加入
不同功能之官能基，未來在醫學上的應用將受到重視。 
除了液晶材料外，顯示器之設計如 photonic application 液晶相，缺陷，水溶
