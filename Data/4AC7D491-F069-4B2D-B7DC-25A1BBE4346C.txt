Abstract
In planning the trajectories of motor-driven
parallel platform manipulators, the objective is
to identify the trajectory which accomplishes the
assigned motion with the minimal travel time
and energy expenditure subject to the constraints
imposed by the kinematics and dynamics of the
manipulator structure. In this study, the possible
trajectories of the manipulator are modeled
using a parametric path representation, and the
optimal trajectory is then obtained using a
hybrid scheme comprising the particle swarm
optimization method and the local conjugate
gradient method. The numerical results confirm
the feasibility of the optimized trajectories and
show that the hybrid scheme is not only more
computationally efficient than the standalone
particle swarm optimization method, but also
yields solutions of a higher quality.
KeyWords: parallel platform manipulator;
trajectory planning; particle swarm optimization;
conjugate gradient method; hybrid strategy
二、緣由與目的
Parallel platform manipulators (PPM)
comprise a mobile platform connected to a fixed
base through three or more articulated links and
are used extensively throughout industry for
such diverse applications as high-precision
positioning systems, fiber alignment, flight
simulators, robotic manipulators, automatic
inspection systems, and so forth. Each link
within the PPM is attached to the base via a
universal joint, and to the mobile platform by
either a universal joint or a spherical joint.
Furthermore, each link has a linear actuator at its
base such that the link length can be adaptively
varied as required to control the final position
and orientation of the platform. Due to their
closed-loop kinematic chains, PPMs are ideally
suited for applications requiring a high rigidity,
4common solution. Once the termination criteria
have been attained (e.g. a specified number of
iterations have been performed or the fitness
error satisfies the minimum error requirement,
for example), the algorithm terminates, and the
current optimal particle is taken as the global
optimal solution of the problem of interest. PSO
has a low computational complexity and is
therefore cheaper and faster than
evolutionary-type schemes such as Genetic
Algorithms (GAs). Furthermore, PSO has very
few parameters to adjust and can therefore be
easily applied to many different applications
with very little modification.
To understand the operation of a typical
PSO, consider a swarm of P particles in an
n-dimensional space. Let px [ 1px … pnx ]
T
be the position of the pth particle, and let
( )pxG G be a problem-dependent cost function
which evaluates the “fit”(i.e. the degree of
optimality) of particle p in accordance with its
position in the search space. As each particle
flies through the search space, it maintains a
record of the coordinates corresponding to the
best personal solution it has found to date, i.e.
ppb [ 1ppb … pnpb ]
T
. In addition, the PSO
optimizer maintains the global position of the
best solution found by any of the particles in the
iterations thus far, i.e. gb[ 1gb … ngb ]
T
. In
the ith iteration of the PSO solution procedure,
the personal and global best positions are
updated as follows:

The velocities of the individual particles are then
changed (i.e. accelerated) such that they move
toward their new personal best positions and the
updated global best position in accordance with

The new position of each particle is then derived
as follows:
1i
pjx
 1i ipj pjx v  (4).
In Eqs. (3) and (4), 1ipjv
 is the velocity of
particle p with respect to the j-th dimension; 1c
and 2c are two positive constants; rand( ) and
Rand( ) are two normal distribution functions
used to introduce an element of randomness into
the search process, and w is the inertia weight
and is used to control the convergence
characteristics of the solution procedure.
However, when PSO is applied to
constrained problems, it can only find the
optimal solution to this problem if this solution
is actually contained within the initial search
space. In other words, the quality of the PSO
solution is fundamentally dependent upon the
appropriateness of the initial population [11]. In
addition, although PSO generally converges
rapidly during the initial iterations of the
solution procedure, it tends to suffer
convergence problems during the later iterations.
For example, if one or more of the particles are
already located at the global best position but
have an inertia weight and velocity greater than
nil from the previous time step, the algorithm
6In the planning problem considered in this
study, the objective is to determine the trajectory
which falls entirely within the workspace of the
PPM and results in the minimum travel time and
energy consumption when moving the platform
from an initial configuration 0x to a final
configuration fx . The trajectory of the optimized
motion will strongly depend on the adopted
expression of the cost function. Therefore, the
cost function is essentially a weighted function
of the consumed energy and the time interval
over the time interval t extending from 0t to
0ft = t Δt and can be defined as

In Eq. (6),  is a weighting coefficient with a
value in the range 0 1  ,  is a positive
weighting number used to adjust the order of
magnitude of the product of the travel time and
the weighing number  relative to that of the
energy consumption term. The output torque of
each motor in the cost function depends on the
corresponding trajectory and can be derived
from the following inverse dynamics equation:
In order to ensure the practical feasibility of
the planned optimal trajectory, the planning
process must take account of the physical
constraints imposed by the PPM structure and
actuator mechanism on the motion of the
platform. Each link length must always satisfy
the constraint. In addition, the linear velocity
and acceleration of each link must satisfy.
Moreover, each motor has a designed maximum
output torque value,
To facilitate the hybrid solution procedure,
the possible trajectories between the initial and
final PPM poses are modeled using a simple
B-spline function. The trajectory x at each time
sub-interval 1 ii ttt (i=0, 1,…,n-1) can be
interpolated as

and kxˆ (k=1, 0, …, n, n+1) are the (n+3)
control points which collectively define the
B-spline function. In addition, u is the

in which the prime denotes differentiation with

By substituting xand x into the torque
term in the cost function and into the constraints,
respectively, the constrained optimization
problem can be recast as an unconstrained
problem by adding a weighted penalty function
according to the prescribed constraints. The
resulting pseudo cost function can thus be

As described in the following section, the
validity of the proposed hybrid optimization
scheme was confirmed by performing a series of
simulations in which the optimal time- and
energy-efficient trajectories between 0x and
fx were obtained using various weighting
coefficient values  and imposed constraints
of: 0.2mminl  , 3.0mmaxl  , maxl =0.9 m/sec,
maxl =1.0
2m / sec , and maxτ is 20 Nm. In
performing the simulations, the value of the
positive weighting numberwas specified as
=1 410 in order to ensure that the product of
the travel time and the weighing number 
was of a similar order of magnitude to that of
the energy consumption term. In addition, the
constant m in the K-S penalty function was
assigned a value of m = 10 (m=1,…,5). The
weighting factors mr (m=1,…,5) governing the 
magnitude of the penalty should be chosen
appropriately only when the constraints are
actually violated since assigning a small value
may result in major constraint violations, whilst
a large value will result in a poor optimization
problem. Thus, the values of the parameters are
specified the same value 1 5r r  = 71 10 in
accordance with the results of a few trial and
error simulations using the normalized
constraints given in Eqs. (10)-(14).
In the simulations, the trajectories between
the specified beginning and end points of the
platform, i.e. 0x and fx , were modeled by a B-
spline function comprising eight control points.
As a result, each path contained just two
undetermined control points. In performing the
simulations, the termination criteria were
specified as follows: (1) a maximum of 350
iterations; or (2) a relative change in the fitness
value of the best particle of less than 0.01
between two consecutive iterations.
The aim of the multi-objective problem
considered in this study is to minimize both the
time and the energy expended in driving the
parallel platform of the PPM from one end-pose
to another. In the cost function derived for this
optimization problem in Eq. (9), the weighting
coefficient value  takes values in the range
=0~1, where  =0 is equivalent to a
minimal-energy trajectory planning problem,
while =1 corresponds to a minimal-time
trajectory planning problem. Figure 4 illustrates
the trajectories corresponding to the six values
of the weighting coefficient. The results clearly
show that the length of the planned path reduces
as the value of the weighting coefficient
increases, and therefore yields a reduction in the
travel time. Conversely, the path associated with
=0 has the longest traverse distance (i.e. the
greatest workspace), and therefore has a greater
travel time, but a lower link velocity and energy
expenditure. Of particular note in this figure is
the close agreement between the two planned
paths obtained using weighting coefficient
values of =0.6 and 0.8, respectively, which
implies that a weighting of 0.6~0.8 represents
the optimal compromise between the two
competing objectives of the present
multi-objective optimization problem.
The selection of the weighting coefficient
values can lead to various types of motions and
the corresponding state. Figure 5 illustrates the
time-dependent variation of the Jacobian matrix
determinant when driving the platform along the
planned trajectory obtained using a weighting
coefficient of =0.3. It can be seen that the
determinant maintains a non-zero value at all
points along the trajectory, and thus the
singularity problem is avoided. Consequently, as
shown in Figure 8, the motor torques required to
