the category of colloidal (Chuang et al., 2005). Based on silica chemistry, the solubility of colloidal 
silica in pure water is limited to the range of 100-140 mg/l at 25? and at pH below 8 (Roque, 
1996), the soluble species being in the form of Si(OH)4. Owing to the limited solubility of silica in 
water, the standard industrial guideline has been to limit the maximum silica concentration to about 
120 mg/l in the retentate at 25? to reduce the scaling and fouling problems in reverse osmosis 
(RO) system (Freeman and Majerle, 1995). Therefore, this limitation becomes an indispensable of 
reclamation and reuse of silica-rich wastewater or waste cooling. 
 
Chemistry of silica fouling is very complex; amorphous silica can foul the membranes by 
monomeric precipitation, deposition of colloidal particles or as biogenic amorphous silica (Iler, 
1979; Sheikholeslami and Tan, 1999). Clearly, the pretreatment is indeed required to reduce silica 
content and to increase the recovery of RO membranes in reclamation and reuse processes for 
silica-rich wastewater or waste cooling. Various treatment processes can be used for removal of 
silica from water, such as lime softener, hot processes softener, anion exchange unit and membrane 
filtration. In which, chemical clarification is one of the most practical units employed as 
pretreatment for membrane desalination (Masarwa et al., 1997; Sheikholeslami et al., 2001, 2002; 
Al-Rehaili, 2003). Chemicals such as lime, soda ash and iron salts are used extensively for silica 
removal in softening processes.  Research of Al-Rehaili (2003) showed that the addition of 
precipitation aids such as alum, sodium aluminate or ferric chloride could improve performance of 
the lime-soda ash process and reduce content of silica in groundwater. Also, anionic polymer was 
found helpful for silica reduction at a low dosage. However, Sheikholeslami et al. (2002) reported 
that sodium aluminate alone was not able to reduce the silica concentration significantly; moreover, 
the addition of soda ash only slightly improved the efficiency. In addition, the study of Duan and 
Gregory (1996) concluded that coagulation by aluminum salts can be greatly affected by quite low 
levels of soluble silica; also, the effect is highly dependent on pH. However, the studies reported in 
the literatures dealing with silica removal in coagulation with aluminum salts in the wastewater 
only limited available. Therefore, the behaviors of silica removal by aluminum salts needed more 
comprehensive studies in laboratory and field. 
 
The study described in this article was part of an extensively research aimed at wastewater 
reclamation and reuse in a high-tech industrial park. The objectives of this article were to 
investigate the characteristics of chemical coagulation processes by aluminum salts on silica 
removal in the effluent of wastewater treatment plant; moreover, to establish the optimum 
conditions of coagulation for further application.  
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Experimental methods 
Coagulation and Flocculation. Four different experiments, included (1) single coagulation, (2) 
single flocculation, (3) combined coagulation and flocculation and (4) combined coagulation and 
PAA (polyacrylic acid, (C3H5NOC3H4O2)n, molecular weight 1,500-5,000 g/mol) and PDADMA 
(polydiallyl dimethyammonium chloride, (C8H16NCl)n, molecular weight 200,000-350,000 g/mol). 
Plastic reactors and other reserved containers were used to prevent possible leaching from glass. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Effects of coagulants, flocculants and pH on colloidal silica removal 
All of single coagulation and flocculation experiments were carried out at pH of 7.5 in jar tests. 
Table 2 summarizes the performances of coagulation by PACl and alum. It shows that the 
concentration of colloid silica was significantly reduced to 14.0 mg/l at PACl dosage of 150 mg/l as 
Al2O3; moreover, the removal ratios were increased with the dosage of coagulants. Comparing with 
alum, the coagulant PACl demonstrated a higher achievement on colloid silica removal in the 
dosage range of 0 to 150 mg/l as Al2O3. Previous study on coagulation of aluminum salts showed 
that alum and PACl could precipitate to form different solid phases of flocs for colloidal removal 
(Benschoten and Edzwald, 1990a, 1990b). Apparently, the polymeric structure of PACl could 
provide more positively charged surface within the PACl precipitates and colloid, therefore 
produced lower silica concentration than alum flocs in this study. 
 
From other point of view, figure 1 illustrates that a positive linear relationship between coagulants 
dose and removed silica was established with a good correlation. It demonstrates a very interesting 
occurrence for coagulation of the effluent. Although PACl showed higher performance on overall 
colloidal silica removal than alum, the specific silica removal capacity of the two coagulants were 
almost same. It was approximate 0.135 mg SiO2/mg Al2O3 when the dosage of coagulants was in 
range of 30 to 150 mg/l as Al2O3. This phenomenon implied that the precipitation of aluminum 
flocs should be the major mechanisms of coagulation for colloid silica removal at neutral 
environment of pH 7.5, however, the higher charged precipitates of PACl can improve silica 
removal with charge neutralization. Figure 2 illustrates the characteristics of single flocculation 
with cation polymer (PDADMA) and anion polymer (PAA). Both PDADMA and PAA polymers 
could not reduce colloid silica content, regardless of charge type and molecular weight.

Effects of PAA on colloidal silica removal 
All of combined coagulation and flocculation experiments were also accomplished at pH of 7.5. 
Figure 5 and 6 illustrate the effects of flocculant PAA on silica removal in PACl and alum 
coagulation processes, respectively. In PACl coagulation, addition of flocculant PAA can slightly 
increase silica removal ratios when the dosage was in the range of 0.5-3 mg/l. The removal ratio 
was approximate 80 % at the conditions of PACl dosage of 180 mg/l as Al2O3 and PAA of 3.0 mg/l, 
and it seemed to approach a maximum of silica removal at pH of 7.5 in this study. 
 
However, comparing with PACl, alum coagulation experiments demonstrated a dissimilar behavior 
on silica removal. The effectiveness of addition of flocculant PAA was not clear; moreover, the 
removal ratios of silica were increased linearly with the dosage of alum. The removal ratios were in 
the range of 40 to 50 % at alum dosage of 180 mg/l as Al2O3 and PAA of 0.5-3.0 mg/l. 
 
Summarizing the results of coagulation and flocculation experiments, it implies that the positive 
charged aluminum precipitates contributed initially a chance of charge neutralization for amorphous 
silica on the surface of precipitates. The high charged PACl precipitates demonstrated higher 
performances on silica removal than alum and produced lower concentration of silica. Then, when 
the complex flocs of aluminum precipitates and amorphous silica was formed, precipitation of the 
complex flocs became the major mechanism of silica removal; meanwhile, the flocs developed 
from PACl or alum showed same specific capacity on silica reduction. Moreover, adjusting pH to 
above 8 for increasing silica ionization was one of effective operations for improving colloidal 
silica removal in aluminum coagulation processes. 
coagulation was suggested as a pretreatment unit for improving turbidity, silica and SCOD removal 
in wastewater reclamation processes; the optimal conditions of operation were determined of PACl 
of 60 mg/l as Al2O3, PAA of 0.5 mg/l, waste flocs of 90 mg/l and pH of 8 in this study.

CONCLUSION 
The objectives of this study were to investigate the characteristics of colloidal silica removal in 
chemical coagulation processes by aluminum salt; moreover, to establish the optimum conditions of 
coagulation for further application on wastewater reclamation and reuse in a high-tech industrial 
park. Based on the results of this research, conclusions were made as the following: 
 
1. The PACl showed higher performances on colloidal silica removal than alum. Interestingly, the 
two coagulants demonstrated same capacity on silica removal. The specific silica removal capacity 
was approximate 0.135 mg SiO2/mg Al2O3 when the dosage of coagulants was in range of 30 to 150 
mg/l as Al2O3. 
 
2. Adjusting pH to above 8 for increasing silica ionization was one of effective operations for 
improving colloidal silica removal in aluminum coagulation processes.
