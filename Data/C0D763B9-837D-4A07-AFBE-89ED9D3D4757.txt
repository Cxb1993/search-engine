1. Introduction 
1.1 Development Tools 
JaNet 
JaNet package is a java neural network 
toolkit, developed by Gander and Patocchi 
(1996). JaNet can assist us in designing, 
testing, and training the neural network 
model for applications.  
MontyLingua 
 MontyLingua, developed by Liu (2004), 
can assist us in determining the 
morphologies of words in the given 
document. 
Figure 1 shows the system hardware 
and software for the research and 
development.

1.2 Estimative Criterion 
In this research, we measure the system 
retrieval effectiveness by the well-known IR 
standard measures (i.e., recall and precision) 
that are proposed by Salton (1989). With 
respect to a given query, the documents can 
be partitioned into four sets as shown in 
Table 1. In Table 1, “Relevant” means the 
uploaded document is relevant to the query 
and “Irrelevant” means the document isn’t 
relevant to the query. After running the 
proposed categorization system, it may have 
two results. One is “Retrieved”: it means our 
system infers the document is relevant to the 
query, the other is “Not Retrieved”: it means 
our system infers the document isn’t 
relevant to query. 
Table 1. Relevant and retrieved sets 
 Retrieved Not Retrieved 
Relevant A C 
Irrelevant B D 
 
In Table 1, we define that: The A 
means “document is relevant to the query 
and system infers the document is relevant 
to the query.” The B means “document isn’t 
relevant to the query but system infers the 
document is relevant to the query.” The C 
means “document is relevant to the query 
but system infers the document isn’t relevant 
to the query.” The D means “document isn’t 
relevant to the query and system infers the 
document isn’t relevant to the query.” 
The recall of an information system is 
defined as the ratio of the number of 
relevant documents returned to the total 
number of relevant documents in the 
collection. The recall is shown as following 
equation. 
A=
A C

 The precision is the ratio of the number 
of relevant documents returned to the total 
numbers of retrieved documents in the 
collection. The precision is shown as 
following equation.

suggested category is depicted for user 
evaluation.

Document Searching Module 
Figure 4 shows the document search 
flow chart. In this module, user can selects 
or input a set of keyword, which represents 
the document that user want, and the system 
will import this vector into the neural 
network classifier. The output will be 
calculated automatically and the system 
shows the classification results to user.

2.1.3 System Database Design 
The system database is displayed in the 
form of ER-Model as shown in Figure 5. 
The database is divided into three parts 
including ontology part, ANN part and Doc 
category part. The system database is 
displayed in the form of ER-Model and 
shown in Figure 5. These parts are explained 
as follows.

Figure 7. The category of CMP patent 
domain 
 
Patent News 
In this case, we collect 100 pieces of 
patent-related news. They are classified into 
3 types, i.e., patent licensing, new patent 
announcement, and patent infringement.  
 
2.2.2 Construct Domain Ontology Schema 
The ontology of CMP patent domain 
and patent knowledge domain are defined by 
domain experts. 
 
CMP Patent Domain 
First, the CMP process is introduced in 
Figure 8. Chemical mechanical polishing 
(CMP) is a technique used in semiconductor 
fabrication for polishing the top surface of 
an in-process semiconductor wafer or other 
substrate. In Figure 8, the wafer or the 
substrate is carried by a rotational carrier 
and polished by a pad on the rotational 
platen. In the polishing process, the slurry, 
assisting in polishing, is carried by a conduit. 
The chemical, assisting in cleaning, are 
carried by another conduit. 
 
Figure 8. The diagram of CMP process 
 
Figure 9 shows the CMP ontology schema 
that is constructed by using the training 
documents. There are 3 parts including 
chemical component, cleaning system, and 
mechanism of CMP in the ontology schema. 
Figure 9. The ontology of CMP patents 
 
Figure 9 shows the classes and their 
relations. For example, the class 
“CMP_method” and another class 
“substrate” have a relation called “polish”. 
10/27/2009 8
with slurry supplied to the interface of the substrate 140 and the pad 110, the substrate 110 is chemically 
and mechanically polished by CMP.

3. System Implementation and Evaluation 
3.1 System Implementation 
3.1.1 Pre-Training Function 
 
This function includes 2 sub-functions, 
document feature collection and ANN 
model construction. Figure 11 shows the 
document feature collection table. The 
document feature collectors of each ANN 
model are shown in the table.

User can click the link to open “Doc 
Feature Collector” and this application is 
shown in Figure 12.

3.1.2 Classified Function 
Figure 18 shows the uploading interface of 
new document. After clicking “submit,” the 
document is classified via ontology-based 
ANN model and shown in Figure 19. In 
Figure 19, the 2-layer classification result, 
included main class and subclass, is shown.

3.1.3 Search Function 
Figure 20 shows the view of ANN 
search function. After selecting the classes 
and relation statements of CMP ontology, 
the input vector is processed via 
ontology-based ANN model and shown in 
Figure 21. In Figure 21, the search result, 
included main class and subclass, is shown 
and hyperlink is clicked for specific 
category.

4. Conclusions 
 In this research, our objective is 
providing a high-effect and high-accuracy 
system that can classify the stored 
documents automatically, consistently and 
promptly. The speed of handling documents 
is slower greatly than the one of documents 
generation. Therefore, we hope to propose 
an ontology-based neural network document 
categorization system which could classify 
huge information systematically and assist 
user in information retrieve.
