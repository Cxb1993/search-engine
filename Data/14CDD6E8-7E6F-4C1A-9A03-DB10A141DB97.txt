and two-dimensional in this work. In practice, a single globular cell
might appear ﬂat such that variation on z− directionmight be neg-
ligible compared to that on x–y plane. Hence geometric model in
circular shape is reasonable to describe the domain of cytoplasm of
many oocyte cells and is then deﬁned as

2.2. Initial condition
Dye-injection experiments are often employed to trace the
intra- or intercellular transport processes in real time. Probing
molecules are injected into the cell at the selected spotwith certain
injection speed (stagnant [26] or pressurized [23]). Initial condition
of the model here describes the injection of the dye as a fast and
steady ﬂow of minimum quantity of dye molecules. Being highly
concentrated at the injection spot, the dye concentration is well
approximated with Dirac delta function, which characterizes the
distribution as an inﬁnitely sharp peak at the pinpoint where ﬂuo-

greater the value is, the more dye molecules are immobilized at
the region where dye is induced and restrained from moving.
In other words, without an explicit binding constant , it is not
physically meaningful trying to ﬁt a diffusion process (in which
binding play an important role) with this model curve all the way
from start to end. The slope of experimental data curve before
the “shoulder” is controlled by Dapp,1cyt , while the saturation ratio
at which the experimental curve levels off is strongly dependent
on the proportion of boundmolecules, thus the portion beyond the
“shoulder” can not be justiﬁed with this non-binding mechanism.
Byﬁtting the early stagedata (before the appearance of “shoulder”),
Dapp,1cyt is determined as the major parameter in the non-binding
model with which we attempt to ﬁt the experimental data.
One of the three bindingmechanisms proposed in Eqs. (16)–(18)
emerges to reach the best curve-ﬁtting than others, and the dif-

7. Remarks
Although criticism of diffusion theory applying to intracel-
lular exists [4,28], mass transport within the scale of cells and
timescale of microinjection experiments seems to be reasonably
interpretable with simple diffusion models [29,23,17]. Some modi-
ﬁcation of the model might be needed to draw closer to reality, for
example, cytoplasmic streaming. Cytoplasmic diffusion accounts
for merely a small part of intracellular transport mechanism. How-
ever, it could be the simplest one among them to be elucidated ﬁrst
before including the others to complete the puzzle.
