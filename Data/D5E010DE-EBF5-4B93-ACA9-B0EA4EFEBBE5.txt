1.  Introduction 
    The energy produced by using organic solar cell energy has been widely studied in view of its practical 
importance. One uses non-renewable energy so quickly that non-renewable energy source is reduced rapidly 
year by year. If this situation is continuing, non-renewable energy will be disappeared within a hundred year, 
or about 50 years. In addition, carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are produced from fossil fuel 
burned. It would produce more pollution in the environment, and increase the greenhouse effect in the world. 
In the past one hundred year, the earth temperature was increased in an average of 0.6 oC. If the warming speed 
is continuing to increase on the earth, the earth’s temperature will be increased 1 to 3 oC after a couple of year. 
Furthermore, the greenhouse effect will make one fifth to one third or more of living things to disappear. 
Therefore, the development of new energy will become important in the twenty-first century. 
    So far, the scientists give a lot of attention to develop different alternative energy sources, such as solar 
energy, natural gas, biofuel, water power, geothermal energy, and tidal energy. One of the potential alternative 
energies is the organic solar energy due to their advantages of easy fabrication, low cost and abundant 
availability. There are three kinds of solar cells under research: (i) inorganic solar cell, (ii) dye-sensitized solar 
cell and (iii) organic solar cell in Figure 1.The sun for everyday irradiates the earth with approximately 1022 
joules of energy which is much larger than the 1018 joules that are consumed per day by the earth’s inhabitants 
(Crabtree et al., 2007). With the discovery of efficient photo-induced electron-acceptor and electron-donor 
transfer from a conjugated polymer, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells has become one of 
the most successful device structures developed in the field to date. In BHJ device, several effective methods 
include solution concentration, spin-speed, solvent annealing, thermal treatments, morphology control using 
mixed solvent mixtures or additives materials of buffer layer between active layer and metal cathode.

   2.3    P3HT:PCBM Blend Solution Preparation: P3HT and PCBM were purchased from Aldrich and 
Nanc-C. Each powder was dissolved in chlorobenzene with 1:50 w/w to obtain the 2 wt % solution. After 
P3HT and PCBM solutions were mixed in a 1:1 ratio to form the 2 wt % solution. 
   2.4    ITO glass pieces were coated with P3HT/PCBM solution which was dissolved in chlorobenzene 
at 700 rpm by using spin coater. After coating, all the samples dried in an enclosed carrier for 20 ~ 25 min and 
then put on the shadow mask in the thermal evaporation. There were three steps that needed to pay more 
attention when operated the thermal evaporation. First, the pressure was needed below 3x10-2 torr by using the 
rotator pump. Second, pressure was below 5x10-5 torr by using the diffusion pump. Finally, when the cathode 
Al thickness reached 1450 Å, it could be stopped. When the temperature cooled down to ambient temperature, 
the photons were induced. After evaporation, all samples needed to be dried in a vacuum oven at 120 oC for 10 
min. This processing is called post-treatment. The current conversion efficiency and the current-voltage (I-V) 
characteristic curve of organic bulk hetero-junction solar cell could be measured by solar simulator which 
equipped with Xe lamp; AM 1.5 G. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Effect of kind of solvents on power conversion efficiency 
Until now, there are many factors which can enhance the power conversion efficiency in organic solar 
cell, e.g., roughness of active layer surface and solubility of solvent and solute. Christoph et al. (2004) 
reported that the different solvents would make the active layer surface have different roughness, because 
different solvents have different evaporation rates. One would make a film of active layer be of low 
roughness and high mobility. This study wanted to choose the better evaporation rate based on the boiling 
point of each solvent. A solvent with high boiling point would have slow evaporation rate, resulted in 
uniform surface of active layer. Hence, different solvents would have different solubility with 
regioregular-P3HT (rr-P3HT). Table 2 shows the information about the boiling point, mobility, and 
solubility in different kind of solvents.

Fig. 5 Effect of active layer thickness on power conversion efficiency and fill factor in the blend layer 
device. 
 
3.3Effect of post-annealing temperature on power conversion efficiency 
The thickness of active layer is one of the factors to affect the power conversion efficiency (η) of solar 
cell. The active layer at hetero-junction of donor and acceptor materials will produce the excitons when the 
sunlight illuminated the active layer. The excitons will diffuse into the interface of donor and acceptor, and 
then separate into the electron and electron hole pairs. Meanwhile, the electron and electron hole pairs transfer 
to the outside circle from the active layer. However, if the distance of active layer is too long, the electron and 
electron hole pairs appear the surface recombination. This phenomenon would produce the large serial 
resistance in the solar cell system. The thickness of the active layer plays an important role in photovoltaic 
characteristics of the device. In order to optimize the performance of the device, devices with different active 
layer thickness were fabricated. Keeping the thermal annealing conditions (post-annealing) treatment at 120 
°C for 10 min, the different active layer thicknesses of the photovoltaic devices were used to measure the I-V 
curves. I-V characteristics under an illumination of 100 m W/cm2 (under AM 1.5G conditions) for the devices 
with different active layer thickness are plotted in Fig. 6. The open circuit voltage is about 0.50 V on changing 
the active layer thickness. However, the short circuit current density and the power conversion efficiency of

16.23 nm, respectively. The surface becomes rougher as the annealing temperature increased from 90 to 120 
°C. However, further increasing the temperature from 150 °C to 180 °C, the surface becomes less rough 
compared to the film treated from 90 to 120 °C. The post-annealing of 120 °C to compose of not only a higher 
roughness compared to the other films but also a much coarser texture with broad hill-like features. The 
highest efficiency is obtained for the devices with the active layer thermally treated. The obvious relation 
between the device performance and the surface roughness of the films, concluded from the morphology study. 
On the other hand, the higher roughness of the film will give higher efficiency device. The reason of possible 
for this might be the increased contact area between the polymer film and the metal cathode for the films with 
higher surface roughness. Hence, the films treated at 120 °C, which may result in a more efficient charge 
collection at the interface.

楊淑鈞 ，改變系統組裝方式以提升高分子太陽能電池效率值，元智大學碩士論文，2011 
 
自評： 
本研究已完成系統組裝的太陽能電池，達到原規畫的工作，惟效率只達 1.8%, 尚有改
進的空間。 
部份可能歸於台灣各學會團體無積極行事有很大原因。沒有特別規劃以及有計畫的和
國際團體作連結，實為可惜。 
在此行中主要參與的兩個子題為 Environmental biotechnology and Industrial 
technology。在 這兩個子主題中，主要還是在探討菌種的馴化和生長環境變化，在
Industrial technology則有討論到 bioreactor和固定化酵素的技術。唯此些技術並沒有
特別的新穎。但在 plenary Session: Sang Yap Lee ”Systems metabolic engineering for 
chemicals and materials ”其演講內容實令我印象深刻，從過去做研究而言，大部份是
屬於單打獨鬥，每一位專家學者都有自己的特長，而且非常的專精，專業愈分愈細，
但當要應用時，通常需要整合，系統化的思考邏輯，這方面幾乎大部分的專家學者都
沒有這個能力。在韓國Lee教授的團隊竟然可以將複雜的代謝工程系統化，甚至控制。
待此種能力的建立將會影響其成校與該國家整體的發展，就目前台灣的生物技術發展
可能都不是其對手。 
    在此次參加會議，除了和國際專家學者交換意見外，也和葡萄王公司陳勁初副總
一起同行，和陳副總在這次旅程中做了很多交流，尤其在產品開發和發酵槽的操作都
有很好的想法，從個人在從事研究上有很多助益。 
    當然，在此次會議也有很多的想法，對未來有很大幫助，惟歷年國科會的輔助
經費下降，今年只有輔助 6萬元，對歐洲之行，實為不足。可能因此很少台灣學者
去參加此會議，如每年都是此額度，其實就只能在亞洲地區進行交流，這可能需要
國科會能適度調整輔助額度。
