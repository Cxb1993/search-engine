conditions, chaotic mixing effects are induced to 
mix the species. Notably, the fluid interfaces can 
be effectively and repeatedly stretched and 
folded, resulting in effective mixing when the 
mixing is chaotic. Electrokinetically-driven 
active mixing approaches have also been 
proposed in recent years to mix the species 
streams. A sequential injection of the species 
into a microchannel by the periodic switching of 
an externally applied electric field is a simple 
active method in electrokinetic flow [10, 11]. In 
this mixing scheme, the mixing efficiency is 
enhanced by increasing the interfacial contact 
area between the two species at a suitable 
switching frequency. However, this method does 
not induce chaotic mixing. To generate chaotic 
mixing effects, several active mixing methods 
for electrokinetic flow have been proposed to 
mix the species streams. For instance, the 
application of time-varying periodic electric 
fields to the electrodes in a mixing chamber has 
a chaotic mixing effect, which effectively 
enhances the mixing performance [12]; the use 
of  external oscillatory electric fields excites 
secondary flows in fluids that pass around 
internal obstacles in a microchannel or flow 
along meandering microchannels to improve 
mixing performance [13]; the application of 
periodic electric fields to the electrodes at the 
ends of the closed lateral channel excites 
vortices that cause chaotic mixing effects [14]; 
the introduction of a random perturbation to the 
time-periodic electric field has a chaotic mixing 
effect to improve mixing [15] , and other 
methods are also effective. Furthermore, the 
application of external sinusoidally-alternating 
electric fields to cause electrokinetic instability 
(EKI) phenomena has also been proposed to mix 
the species, and this method has been confirmed 
to improve mixing performance [16, 17]. 
The overwhelming majority of active 
mixing strategies in the literature mix species 
using a periodic perturbation source. The use of 
an aperiodic or a random perturbation source has 
seldom been considered. Generally, a random 
perturbation can be produced using a random 
function generator by a computer. However, it is 
hard to implement in the real physical system. 
Therefore, a deterministic equation is employed 
to produce an aperiodic or a random like 
perturbation source, which is a chaotic 
oscillatory source, to mix the species streams. In 
the study, the effects of an aperiodic perturbation 
source applied in the microfluidic mixer will be 
considered and compare with a harmonic 
perturbation source. The Duffing system is used 
to generate these two perturbation sources [18]. 
In the mixing scheme that is proposed in this 
study, these oscillatory sources are applied to 
electrodes in a mixing chamber to perturb 
electrokinetically the species streams. The 
simulations specifically concern the effects of 
the harmonic and chaotic electric field on the 
fluid flow characteristics and the resulting 
mixing efficiency of the two species streams.

2.1 Governing equations 
In the analysis in this work, the following 
assumptions are made to simplify the governing 
equations: (i) the aqueous solutions that flow 
through the microchannel are incompressible, 
Newtonian fluids; (ii) the gravitational and 
buoyancy effects in the fluid flow are negligible; 
(iii) the two mixing species have the same 
constant diffusion coefficient, and (iv) no 
chemical reaction takes place between the 
species themselves or between the species and 
the microchannel walls. When symmetric 
electrolytes are used, the governing equations 
that describe the current microfluidic mixer 
include, (1) the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for 
the electrical double layer (EDL) potential ( ), 
(2) the Laplace equation for the externally 
applied electric potential ( ), (3) the modified 
Navier-Stokes equation that incorporates an 
electrokinetic driving body force for fluid fields

2.3 Harmonic and chaotic electric fields 
 
In this work, to compare the effects of 
periodic and aperiodic perturbation sources on 
the fluid flow characteristics and mixing 
performance, the Duffing system is adopted to 
produce harmonic and chaotic perturbation 
sources. In the Duffing system, in 
non-dimensional form, [18]

where 1x  and 2x  are the oscillatory sources, 
1P , 2P , and 3P  are the parameters of the 
Duffing system, and Q  and   are the 
amplitude and angular velocity, respectively, of 
the externally periodic force in the Duffing 
system. Notably, Eq. (9) can be solved using the 
Runge-Kutta method. In Eq. (9), the parameters 
1P , 2P , 3P , and   are set to 0.11 P , 
3.02 P , 0.13 P , and 2.1 , respectively. 
When the initial values are taken as 1)0(*1 x  
and 1)0(*2 x , the oscillatory orbits are as 
presented in Fig. 2. When the amplitude in the 
Duffing system is set to 2.0Q  and 0.32, the 
oscillatory orbits are harmonic and chaotic, 
respectively. Notably, the chaotic orbit in 
non-dimensional time 200~100* t  is 
considered to compare different oscillatory 
behavior with the same chaotic orbit in 
non-dimensional time 900~800* t . 
Moreover, the harmonic oscillatory orbits in 
non-dimensional time 200~100* t  are used 
to generate stable harmonic oscillatory sources 
because the oscillatory characteristic is 
independent of the initial values.  
The above oscillatory sources are amplified 
and applied to electrodes in the mixing chamber. 
Notably, the oscillatory characteristics are not 
changed by amplifying the oscillatory sources. 
In this investigation, the intensity of the electric 
potential that is applied to electrodes Ed1 and Ed4 
is *1

between the electrodes on the upper wall. The 
interaction between the local flow field and the 
bulk flow cause recirculation in an anticlockwise 
direction in the vicinity of electrodes Ed3 and 
Ed4 , satisfying the principles of mass 
conservation, as shown in Fig. 3. The intensity

electrodes. A smaller circulation bubble is 
formed outside the electrodes Ed1 and Ed2 in the 
presence of an electric field because the 
direction of flow under the electrokinetic driving 
force opposes that of the bulk.  
When the electric potentials that are applied 
to electrodes Ed2 and Ed3 are higher than those 
applied to electrodes Ed1 and Ed4, as described 
above, a clockwise recirculation structure is 
formed between electrodes Ed1 and Ed2 in the 
mixing chamber, as presented in Fig. 4. 
Figure 5 plots the evolution over time of 
the u-velocity in the EDL between the electrodes 
on the lower walls in the mixing chamber. As 
described above, when the u-velocity is positive, 
the applied electric potentials at these electrodes 
satisfy * 2,

anticlockwise recirculation structure is formed in 
the mixing chamber, to perturb the flow streams, 
as presented in Fig. 3. In contrast, when the 
u-velocity is negative, meaning that the applied 
electric potentials at the electrodes satisfy

excitation by different chaotic electric fields. 
Therefore, the mixing efficiency can be further 
increased when suitably oscillating chaotic 
electric potentials are applied to these electrodes. 
Restated, perfect mixing can be achieved by 
applying suitable chaotic electric fields to the 
electrodes. Overall, the simulation results 
demonstrate that the mixing scheme causes 
strong perturbations, which mix species 
efficiently. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
This study presented a novel microfluidic 
mixer in which species are mixed by applying 
harmonic and chaotic electric fields to four 
electrodes in the mixing chamber. The Duffing 
system was employed to produce harmonic and 
chaotic electric fields, and numerical simulations 
were performed to study the effects of the 
harmonic and chaotic electric fields on the fluid 
flow characteristics and mixing performance. 
The results show that the application of 
harmonic oscillating electric potentials to the 
four electrodes causes periodic perturbation 
effects in the mixing chamber. Aperiodic 
perturbations in the mixing chamber are caused 
by the application of chaotic oscillating electric 
potentials to these electrodes. These perturbation 
effects efficiently mix species. Overall, the 
results verify that the mixing scheme proposed 
herein provides high mixing efficiency.

Abstract-The study presents a novel microfluidic mixing scheme
in which the fluid streams are mixed via the applications of
harmonic and chaotic electric potentials to four electrodes mounted
on the upper and lower surfaces of the mixing chamber. Numerical
simulations are performed to analyze the effects of the resulting
harmonic oscillating and chaotic oscillating electrokinetic
perturbation forces. The harmonic and chaotic oscillating orbits are
derived by using non-linear Duffing-Holmes equation. Simulation
results indicate that periodic or aperiodic oscillations between the
electrodes are obtained to perturb the fluid streams by using
harmonic or chaotic oscillating electric potentials to these electrodes,
respectively. The results revel that the fluid mixing are improved in
the suggested micromixer.

I. BACKGROUND
Mixing of liquid samples is a critical process in microfluidic
applications, such as biological and chemical analysis, drug
delivery, DNA hybridization, and so on. However, efficient and
rapid mixing is very difficult in these microfluidic systems.
Because the fluid flow is constrained to the low Reynolds number
region in microfluidic devices, liquid samples mixing are
dominated by molecular diffusion. Consequently, mixing take
place very slowly, and requires a very long mixing channel to
achieve a satisfactory mixing result. Therefore, researchers have
proposed micromixing strategies to enhance the mixing of liquid

samples.
The proposed micromixers in past study can be categorized as
either passive mixers or active mixers. Passive micromixers
typically employ particular channel geometry configurations to
increase the interfacial contact area between the mixing liquids.
Many passive mixing strategies have suggested and can improve
efficiently the fluid mixing [1]. In contrast to passive mixing
schemes, active mixers apply an external driving force or use
external mechanical components to apply a periodic or aperiodic
perturbation to the fluids. Various active mixing techniques have
studied and enhance greatly the fluid mixing, for example the
time-periodic pressure perturbation mixer [2], electrokinetic
instability mixer [3], periodically switching/ oscillatory
electroosmotic mixer [4], magnetic-based mixer [5] and so on.
The current study investigates a novel mixing method in
which the fluid mixing is improved via the application of
harmonic and chaotic electric fields to the fluid streams. In this
proposed approach, two aqueous solutions are introduced into the
micromixer by giving constant velocity values at the channel
inlets. In order to generate electrokinetic perturbations, four
electrodes are mounted on the channel walls and applied the
harmonic or chaotic perturbations electric potentials to mix the
flow streams.
II. MATHEMATICAL MODELING
2.1 Governing equations
The geometric configuration of the electrokinetic
micromixer in the present simulations is shown in Figure 1.
Assuming the solutions are incompressible, Newtonian liquids,
and neglect the gravitational and buoyancy effects. Under no
chemical reactions take place, the governing equations used to

are discretized using the finite-volume method. The QUICK
scheme and a fully implicit scheme are used to treat the non-linear
convection terms and transient time term, respectively. The
SIMPLEC method [1] is used to couple the velocity and pressure
field. Finally, the discretized equations are then solved
numerically using the TDMA iteration scheme.
2.3 Harmonic and chaotic perturbations
In this study, the Duffing-Holmes nonlinear equation is used
to derive different oscillating orbits. The oscillatory orbits include
harmonic and chaotic perturbations, and can be expressed as [6]
x; =x;, (6a)
x; = -l1x; -12x; -13x? +Qcos(ru*), (6b)
where x; and x; are oscillatory orbits, 11 , P2' and P3 are
the non-dimensional parameters of the equation, the term
Qcos(n/) is a time-varying perturbation source.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Applying the model shown in Figure 1, numerical
simulations were performed to investigate the effects of the
harmonic and chaotic electric potentials on the flow fields in the
electrokinetically perturbed micromixer. In the simulation, the
width of the channel was specified as W = 50J.Drl • The zeta
potential on all wall surfaces was assumed to be r; = -75mV and
the amplification factor of the applied electric potential was given
as a = 140 . The physical properties of the solutions are
summarized in Table 1, and the Reynolds number and Schmidt
number in the study were assigned as Re =1.25 x 10-2 and
Sc =1x 105 , respectively. The harmonic and chaotic driven
electrical fields are shown in Figure 2.
Figure 3 illustrates the distributions of the flow streamlines
within the micromixe with applications ofthe electric potentials to
the electrodes. At this time instant, the electric potential at
electrodes Edl and Ed4 is higher than that at electrodes Ed2 and
Ed3. Therefore, the electrokinetic driving perturbation force
generated within the EDL on the lower wall acts from electrode
Edl to electrode Ed2, while that within the EDL on the upper wall
acts from electrode Ed4 to electrode Ed3. Since the intensity of
the electric field between electrode Ed1 and electrode Ed2 is equal
to that between electrode Ed3 and electrode Ed4, the
electrokinetically perturbed forces have an equivalent magnitude,
but the flow have an opposite direction along the upper and lower
mixing chamber between the electrodes. As a result, an
anticlockwise recirculation phenomenon is formed near the upper
region of the mixing chamber as shown in Figure 3. On the
contrary, when the electric potential at electrode Ed2 and
electrode Ed3 have a larger value than that at electrodes Edl and
Ed4, expectantly a clockwise recirculation structure is generated
near the lower region of the mixing chamber.
Figure 4 illustrates the evolution over time of the
u-velocity within the EDL between the electrodes pairs on the
lower chamber wall, i.e. at point P as shown in Figure 1. In
electrokinetic driving flow, the electrokinetic perturbation
velocity depends on applied electric potentials on the electrodes.
Because the electrokinetic perturbation velocity varies repeatedly
over time, the recirculation structures near the upper and lower
chamber walls vary repeatedly over time. Note that the magnitude
of the recirculation structure varies with the intensity of the
applied electric potentials between the electrode pairs on the
upper and lower chamber walls, i.e. depends on the electrokinetic
perturbation velocity between the electrodes. Therefore, for
harmonic oscillating with 2T period, the variation of the
electrokinetic perturbation velocity over time is periodic to
perturb the fluid streams. When the chaotic electric potentials
applied to the electrodes, the u-velocity varies irregularly over
time to mix the liquids greatly.
As described above, in the alternate electrokinetically
oscillations, the fluid streams can effective perturbations over
time, and therefore the liquids undergo rapid and significant
mixing, as shown in Figure 5. Consequently, an effective
perturbation effects are obtained within the mixing chamber to
enhance the liquid mixing in the suggested mixing strategy.
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper has investigated a novel microfluidic mixing
scheme in which fluid mixing is achieved via the applications of
the harmonic and chaotic electric fields to four electrodes
mounted on the upper and lower walls of a mixing chamber. The
simulation results have shown that the suggested mixing scheme
generates periodic or aperiodic electrokinetically perturbations
between the electrodes by applying harmonic or chaotic electric
fields to the electrodes, and hence promote time-varying
recirculation structures to enhance the fluid mixing greatly.

velocity of the microcantilever, and z is the vibrational 
amplitude of the dither piezoelectric actuator which drives the 
tip. Note that both  and z are non-dimensionalized by the 
gap between the tip and the sample under equilibrium 
conditions. In the case where the excitation frequency is close 
to the natural frequency of the microcantilever, =1. 
Furthermore, assuming a Si̢Si probe-sample system, the 
coefficients in Eq. (2) have the following values: A

diagrams of  and  are shown in Fig.1 (a) and 2(b), 
respectively. It shown that the system state exist complex 
dynamics. From bifurcation diagram, it can be seen that the 
dynamics of AFMs will change from periodic motion to 
aperiodic motion after the parameter  is greater than 2.54.

exist a strange attractor, and a positive maximum Lyapunov 
exponent is obtained at . Therefore, it guarantees that 
the AFMs fell into chaotic motion at this condition. Next, we 
will use the synchronization technique to synchronize a 
chaotic AFMs to a periodic AFMs.

III. FUZZY CONTROLLER DESIGN  
The fuzzy set theory was initiated by Zadeh [8]. The fuzzy 
logic control (FLC) schemes have been widely developed for 
almost 40 years, and have been successfully applied to many 
applications [9]. Besides, the adaptive fuzzy controller had also 
been used to control and synchronize the chaotic systems [7]. 
However, it takes a long time to obtain the membership 
functions and rule base by trial-and-error tuning in traditional 
FLC design. In this section, we want to address the design 
procedures of FLC. A set of the fuzzy linguistic rules based on 
expert knowledge are used to design the control law of FLC. 
To overcome the trail-and-error tuning of the membership 
functions and rule base, we directly construct the fuzzy rules 
subject to a common Lyapunov function such that the error 
dynamics satisfies stability in the Lyapunov sense. The basic 
configuration of the fuzzy logic system is shown in Fig. 6.  
The fuzzy rule base consists of a collection of fuzzy if-then 
rules expressed as the form if a is A then b is B, where a and b 
denote linguistic variables, A and B represent linguistic values 
that are characterized by membership functions. All of the 
fuzzy rules can be used to construct the fuzzy associated 
memory. 
For the synchronization systems (3) and (4), let the error 
states are 111 xye   and . Subtracting (3) from 
(4) yields the synchronization error dynamics as

master system can reach synchronization with control 
operation. In addition, the phase plane trajectories of controlled 
slave system and the error states are shown in Figs. 9-10. It can 
be seen that the system error states are regulated to zeros 
asymptotically. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
The dynamics analysis and synchronization control for 
AFMs is demonstrated in this study. The results show the 
AFMs will exist chaotic motion under . In order to 
remove the undesired chaotic motion, a fuzzy logic 
synchronization controller is designed. This controller design 
scheme overcomes the trail-and-error tuning to obtain the 
membership functions and fuzzy rules. Numerical simulations 
have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract—This paper studies the bifurcation behavior of the 
probe tip of an atomic force microscope with a 
proportional-plus-derivative (PD) feedback control using the 
DT (differential transformation) method. The dynamic behavior 
of the probe tip with PD control law is characterized by 
reference to maximum Lyapunov exponent plots produced 
using the time-series data obtained from differential 
transformation method. Furthermore, the detailed transitions 
in the dynamic response of the probe tip are examined using 
bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement and the tip 
velocity, respectively. The results indicate that the probe tip 
behavior is significantly dependent on the magnitude of the 
proportional and derivative control gain. Specifically, the probe 
tip motion includes T-, 2T-, 3T-, 4T-, multi-periodic, and chaotic 
motion. Numerical results show that the dynamic behavior will 
leave chaotic motion to periodic motion at Kp=-0.45 in the 
steady state by changing the control loop gain Kv from -0.1 to 
-1.0. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the differential 
transformation method is in good agreement for the considered 
system. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HE atomic force microscope (AFM) provides a powerful 
tool for surface analysis applications in the 
nano-electronics, materials and biotechnology fields. During 
operation, intermolecular forces between the AFM probe tip 
and the sample surface cause a deflection of the 
microcantilever on which the probe tip is mounted. The 
variation in force acting on the tip is then evaluated by using 
some form of optical technique to measure the deflection of 
the cantilever. 
The nonlinear dynamic behavior of an AFM system is a 
major concern since any irregular motion of the AFM probe 
tip inevitably degrades the precision of the measurement 
results. Burnham et al. [1], [2] showed that the

microcantilever of an AFM performed chaotic motion under 
specific physical conditions. Ashhab et al. [3] modeled the 
microcantilever of an AFM using a single-frequency mode 
approximation and analyzed the chaotic dynamics of the 
cantilever-sample system using the Melnikov method. Lee et 
al. [4] analyzed the effects of van der Waals and 
Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov forces on the tip-sample 
interactions induced in dynamic force microscopy (DFM). 
The authors also presented detailed experimental results 
which provided valuable new perspectives and insights into 
DFM. Ruetzel et al. [5] applied the Galerkin method to 
investigate the nonlinear dynamics of an AFM probe tip 
under the assumption that the tip-surface interactions were 
governed by Lennard-Jones potentials. Based upon their 
analysis, the authors showed that the probe tip exhibited a 
broad range of dynamic phenomena, including both periodic 
and chaotic motion. 
However, none of the studies reviewed above presented 
phase portraits, power spectra, Poincaré maps, maximum 
Lyapunov exponent plots or bifurcation diagrams to confirm 
the validity of their predictions for the AFM behavior or use a 
PD (proportional-plus-derivative) feedback to control the 
chaotic motion observed in the AFM system. Accordingly, 
the present study investigates the dynamic behavior of an 
AFM probe tip using two numerical methods, namely the 
differential transformation method [6], [7] and the 
Runge-Kutta method and then characterizes the dynamic 
response of the system by reference to phase portraits, power 
spectra, Poincaré maps, and maximum Lyapunov exponent 
plots. Finally, the chaotic behavior in the AFM system is 
identified using bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement 
and tip velocity, respectively and a PD controller included 
proportional gain and derivative gain is applied to control this 
system.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 presents a mathematical model for the 
time-dependent motions of the microcantilever tip and 
describes the solution of this model using the differential 
transformation method. Section 3 compares and contrasts the 
numerical results obtained by the differential transformation 
method and the Runge-Kutta method for the dynamic 
response of the microcantilever tip at various proportional 
gains and derivative gains. Subsequently, the nonlinear 
dynamic behavior of the probe tip is analyzed by maximum 
Lyapunov exponent plots and bifurcation diagrams, 
respectively. Finally, Section 4 draws some brief conclusions.

B. Situation 1 
In the first situation, the bifurcation parameter was chosen 
to be the Kp, and Kv=0. In the current study, Figs. 1 plot the 
bifurcation diagrams of the tip displacement and the tip 
velocity, respectively, taking Kp as the bifurcation parameter. 
Finally, Figs. 2(a)-2(f) present the maximum Lyapunov 
exponent of the microcantilever tip trajectory at Kp = -0.5, 
-0.47, -0.39, -0.32, -0.22, -0.21, -0.08 and -0.05, respectively.  
Figs 1(a)(b) and 2(a) show that at lower values of Kp, i.e. Kp 
<-0.47, the displacement (X1) and velocity (X2) of the tip both 
exhibit a dynamic periodic response. As Kp is increased from 
-0.47 to -0.41, Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that both the tip 
displacement and the tip velocity perform chaotic motions. 
Fig. 2(b) presents the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kp = 
-0.47 and proof the appearance of chaos. At Kp = -0.4, the 
chaotic motion is replaced by multi-subharmonic motion, as 
shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). When Kp is increased over the 
interval -0.4≤Kp<-0.32, the tip response includes both 
multi-subharmonic and 4T-subharmonic motion. Fig. 2(c) 
presents the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kp =-0.39(4T). 
However, at Kp =-0.32, the 4T-periodic motion is replaced by 
chaotic motion, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Thereafter, the chaotic 
motion changes its unstable state at Kp =-0.22 and is replaced 
by multi-subharmonic motion. In the range -0.22≤ Kp <0.1, 
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show that both the tip displacement and 
the tip velocity perform 4 kinds of motions including T-, 3T-, 
4T-, and multi-subharmonic motions. Figs. 2(e)-2(h) present 
the maximum Lyapunov exponent corresponding to Kp = 
-0.22, -0.21, -0.08 and -0.05, and the maps confirm the 
existence of multi-, 4T-, 3T-subharmonic and T-periodic 
behavior shown in the bifurcation diagrams.  
From the discussions above, it is clear that the dynamic 
response of the probe tip depends on the magnitude of Kp. The 
various motions performed by the tip as Kp increases from -2 
to 0.1 are summarized in Table 3.

In order to analyze that the influence of both Kp and Kv, the 
case is restricted Kp ＜1 and Kv ＜A4 . Also, the PD feedback 
is used to control this system to avoid the chaotic motion 
appear. The bifurcation parameter was chosen to be the Kv at 
Kp =-0.45. 
Figs. 5(a)(b) and 6(a) show that at lower values of Kv, i.e. 
Kv <-0.1, the displacement (X1) and velocity (X2) of the tip 
both exhibit a dynamic periodic response. At Kv = -0.1, the 
T-periodic motion is replaced by chaotic motion, as shown in 
Figs. 5 and 6(b). When Kv is increased over the interval -0.1≤ 
Kv <0.13, the tip response is chaotic motion. Figs. 6(c) and 
6(d) present the maximum Lyapunov exponent at Kv = 0 and 
0.02, respectively.

values of Kv : (a)-1.0, (b)-0.1, (c)0, and (d)0.02. 
 
It is known that if the tip of the AFM system operates in the 
state of aperiodic motion, the resulting broadband vibration 
with large amplitude will lead to a higher probability of 
fatigue failure of microcantilever and decrease the measure 
accuracy of the AFM system. At Kp =-0.45 and Kv =-0.1, the 
maximum Lyapunov exponent is positive and Poincaré map 
demonstrated a fractal structure. It shows that the trajectory of 
the tip displacement is in a state of chaos. In order to 
eliminate the system operating in a no synchronous motion, a 
decreased derivative gain Kv =-0.1 is applied to control this 
system. From Fig. 7, it can be seen that the tip dynamics leave 
the disorder state and turns to a periodic motion in the steady 
state after the derivative gain changes from -0.1 to -1.0.
