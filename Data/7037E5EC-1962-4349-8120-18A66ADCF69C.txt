1. Abstract
In this present work, we examined the working diameter
window of capillary column by fabricating columns with
diameter of 5, 7, 10 and 20 mm. These modified capillary
columns were carefully filled with Taiwan locally laterite
with an average porosity of 0.51 ±0.02 (g/g) and density
of 1.27 ±0.05 (g/cm3). The diffusion experiments were
then carried out in synthesis groundwater with Cs loading
of 0.1 mM at room temperature. Experimental results
showed that diffusion profiles of modified capillary
column fit with Fick’s second law very wel. This result 
reveals that theworking diameter of “capilary column” 
can be expanded to at least 20 mm in which the derived
diffusion coefficients are still valid. Among these four
diameter columns, the derived Kd, apparent and effective
diffusion coefficients from 5 mm diameter show the most
consistent with one another. Although the derived
distribution as well as effective diffusion coefficients are
slightly affected by the aspect of solid to liquid ratio, these
values are still informative of the Cs diffusion behavior in
Taiwan locally laterite. Furthermore, our results show the
potential of using “modified capilary method” in which 
greater diameter implies the possibility of filling in more
variety of geological substances.
2.Introduction
The capillary column method has been introduced recently
to estimate some diffusion properties of concerned
radionuclides in interested materials such as compacted
bentonite.1-8 The subtle volume of capillary implies that a
wide experimental condition can be easily created
simultaneously while the experimental waste can be as
well quite reduced. In the meantime, it is time-beneficial
since the diffusion coefficients can be thus obtained by
solving the diffusion profile of in-diffusion method. With
both advantages, one could understand more the diffusion
properties i.e. effects of pH, concentration, ionic strength,
bulk density onto diffusion of radionuclide in a very short
time.1-8 It is of particularly important for long-term
performance assessment of spent nuclear waste repository
in deep geological environment.
On the contrary to the room-benefit, the tiny volume of
capillary column implies its difficulty when fabricate.
These capillary columns are easily broken into pieces
during packing process and the room of remediation is
limited when one intends to pack identical columns. As a
result, we packed several modified capillary columns with
diameter of 0.5, 0.7, 10 and 20 mm and examined their
validity by a case study of Cs diffusion in Taiwan locally
laterite. These modified capillary columns were
intentionally packed in similar conditions with porosity of
0.51 ±0.02 (g/g) and density of 1.27 ±0.05 (g/cm3). The
diffusion experiments were then carried out with Cs
loading of 0.1 mM in synthesis groundwater at room
temperature. Diffusion coefficients including Kd, apparent
and effective coefficients were thus determined by fitting
its diffusion profile and compared with one another in this
present work.
3.Experimental
3.1 Materials
Al Chemicals used in this work are of analytic grade and
dissolve into milli-Q water without any further purification.
The composition of synthesis groundwater is shown in
Table 1. The Taiwan locally laterite, LTW, was sampled
from the surficial soil with deep of 2-4 meter in Toayuan
county, Taiwan. These LTW soils were sieved and the
fraction of particle diameter less than 0.074 mm was
collected for characteristic analysis and for column packing.
The specific surface area of LTW is 32.25 m2/g (N2-BET)
and its CEC is 14.3 meq/100 g. Its surface composition
determined by EDS spectrum (SEM/EDS, Leo 1530)
presented in terms of average elemental is O (45.81 %), Al
(15.38 %), Si (20.78 %), K (2.27 %) and Fe (14.12 %). Its
major mineral content determined by XRD pattern (Philips
PW1300) is quartz, kaolinite and goethite.
3.2 Column fabrication
The diameters of modified capillary columns are of 5, 7, 10
and 20 mm with identical column length of 40 mm. The
volume of packed Taiwan locally laterite is assumed as that
of column. The mass of packed LTW is the difference
between filled and empty column. At first, one end of these
packed columns was sealed by Parafilm to prevent the LTW
releasing. These columns were then settled down into
polystyrene plate for fixation. After drilling a small pin hole
onto Parafilm, these “fixed” columns were placed into PP 
tube with 50 mL of groundwater for three weeks. After three
weeks of water saturation, these columns were transferred
into another PP tubes with 50 mL of 137Cs-spiked
groundwater with 0.1 mM of CsCl carrier. The purpose of
using 50 mL of Cs solution is to keep the concentration
constant during the whole diffusion period. To prevent the
effect of evaporation, these columns were placed into a
closed system, in this case, a sealed oven. After two and
four weeks of diffusion, these columns were removed from
solutions. The packed LTW was pushed out and cut into
slices with 3 mm of thickness. To prevent the contamination,
the filled LTW was pushed upside down, i.e., the end of
contacting Cs solution was the latest slice leaving column.
The radioactivity of each slice was measured by NaI
detector and the diffusion profile can thus be determined.
3.3 Mathematical solution
The mathematical solution of the diffusion profile of
capillary column is well described in literature.2-8
According to Fick’s second law, the diffusion process 
is able to be described as follows:

experimental results showed that diffusion coefficients
derived from modified capillary column fit very well with
Fick’s second law. The derived apparent diffusion
coefficients are consistent with one another while the
value of distribution as well as effective diffusion
coefficient is slightly affected by the solid to liquid ratio.
This result reveals that using the capillary column with
diameter as large as 20 mm to study the Cs diffusion
behavior is still valid. Our study furthermore shows the
potential of using “modified capilary method”, for 
example, filling in some geological substances with bigger
grain size such as crushed granite or basalt.
