英文摘要 
Keywords: optical thin films, surface plasmon polariton, reversal imprinting, autocloning effect, 
broad bandwidth and omnidirectional antireflection structures, optical anisotropy, 
organic solar cells  
 
In this project, we investigate special optical characteristics of multilayer optical thin films with 
three dimensional nanostructures. Combining with thin film interference, index matching, and 
surface plasma effects, thin films with nanostructures are designed for increasing the external 
quantum efficiency of novel optoelectronic devices.  
In the first part, we used a reversal imprinting-in-metal (RIM) process to fabricate various 
three-dimensional metal structures under low pressure. Refractive index matching and cavity 
effects both enhanced the degree of transmission of these structured metal films. Thus, this RIM 
process allows the ready fabrication of various two- and three-dimensional metallic structures for 
use in surface plasmon-based devices. In the second part, we develop the autocloning technique, 
combined with optical thin films and optical gradient structures, is a practical and compatible 
method for the fabrication of broad-bandwidth, omnidirectional antireflection structures on 
silicon solar cells. In the third part, the external quantum efficiencies of P3HT:PCBM blend solar 
cells decrease significantly when they are bent or illuminated at large incident angles because of 
optical anisotropy of the P3HT:PCBM films. Textured moth-eye structures fabricated by 
nanoimprint lithography on the flexible substrates of organic solar cells reduce the degree of 
interfacial reflection at high incident angles; they should allow more TE-polarized light to absorb 
in the P3HT:PCBM films (active layers) of the organic solar cells.

the sinusoidal metal profiles when using holographic lithography because of nonlinearity of the 
resist sensitivity. Recently, we reported a nanoimprinting-in-metal (NIM) method for patterning 
metal films with sinusoidal profiles of various depths [15]. SPR phenomena allowed energy 
coupling to the other side of such sinusoidal metal films, causing a dramatic increase in the 
transmission. The ability to use NIM to fabricate various three-dimensional (3D) metal structures 
is limited, however, by the mechanical strength of the thin metal film. Furthermore, relatively 
little research has been conducted on 3D metals featuring sub-wavelength structures other than 
hole-arrays or sinusoidal patterns [9]. 
In this study, we prepared various metal structures, such as craters, to further investigate 
extraordinary transmission phenomena. Combining hole-arrays with sinusoidal profiles leads to 
this certain type of 3D metal structure that possesses unique optical characteristics. These 
complicated structures are almost impossible to fabricate using conventional lithographic 
methods. Here we describe an imprinting approach, using a “reversal imprinting in metal” (RIM) 
technique, for patterning various 3D metal structures. This technique is simple to perform, 
suitable for various types of metals, and allows the patterning of various profiles in metal 
structures. Conventional processes for generating 3D metal structures generally involve multiple 
deposition, lithography, and etching steps that can be laborious and expensive. Reversal imprint 
techniques based on nanoimprinting provide simple and inexpensive patterning capabilities that 
can generate certain types of 3D structures [16-20]. To date, most approaches using RIM have 
focused on the fabrication of nano-channels [18, 20]. In this paper, we demonstrate the 
fabrication of complicated 3D metallic structures featuring a variety of patterns through RIM 
processing using various shaped molds. Some of these metallic structures have potential use in 
SPR-based and photonics devices. Moreover, we have observed extraordinary transmittance 
assisting through cavity- and refractive index-matching effects in our sub-wavelength hole-array 
structures. 
 
Part B Using autocloning effects to develop broad-bandwidth, omnidirectional 
antireflection structures for silicon solar cells 
Energy shortages and environmental issues are making solar cells more attractive as future 
energy devices. Because silicon (Si) has several practical advantages, including low cost, good 
thermal stability, mature fabrication technologies, and high efficiency, it is at present the major 
material used in the solar cell industry. The refractive index difference between air and Si, 
however, causes more than 40% of incident light to be reflected back through Fresnel reflection, 
thereby limiting the opto-electrical conversion efficiency of Si solar cells. Several methods have 
 8
poor contact between the electrodes and cells, due to the threadlike profile of these nanotip 
structures. 
To obtain broad-bandwidth, omnidirectional AR structures without degrading the electrical 
properties of the solar cell, in this study we applied an autocloning technique to fabricate AR 
structures on Si solar cells. Autocloning is a deposition technique for the fabrication of 
three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals [14-17]. A structure such as a two-dimensional (2D) 
pillar array is first prepared on the substrate using lithography and etching processes. Next, the 
stacking of alternating layers having different refractive indices onto the patterned substrate is 
performed through ion bombardment during sputtering or high density plasma chemical vapor 
deposition (HDP-CVD) processes [18]. Although the deposition mechanisms of HDP-CVD and 
sputtering are different, both exhibit an angle-selective sputter etching effect, due to ion 
acceleration during the deposition process. The sputter etching effect can lead to good step 
coverage and conformality; therefore, it can be used for the deposition of multilayer thin films on 
patterned photonic crystals. Using the autocloning effect, the multilayer films can be deposited to 
follow the shape of the sub-wavelength structure on the substrate and, thereby, form a 3D 
photonic crystal structure. In this study, we developed a practical method, compatible with 
conventional processes for the fabrication of Si solar cells, by combining optical thin films with 
the autocloning technique. We analyzed the optical behavior of the autocloned AR structures 
through rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) and the 3D finite-difference time domain 
(3D-FDTD) method to optimize their broad-bandwidth, omnidirectional AR properties for solar 
cell applications. 
 
Part C Exploiting optical anisotropy to increase the external quantum efficiency of flexible 
P3HT:PCBM blend solar cells at large incident angles 
 
Much attention is focused at present on research into photovoltaic devices, with the goal of 
exploiting solar light as a next-generation energy source [1-3]. The most popular photovoltaic 
devices are Si-based solar cells—because techniques for their manufacture are mature and they 
can exhibit high efficiency. The inflexibility and opacity of Si-based solar cells are, however, 
limitations on their applicability. Because flexible photovoltaic devices are less likely to fracture 
when bent, they have greater potential in a wide range of applications. Organic photovoltaics 
(OPVs) are promising candidates for use in flexible photovoltaic devices because they are 
polymer-based and can be fabricated on flexible substrates [4-8]. Moreover, OPVs can be

(ii) Optical anisotropy of P3HT:PCBM blend films. The anisotropic properties of P3HT:PCBM 
blends, based on the preferred orientation of the polymer nanocrystallites, strongly influence the 
carrier mobility and optical absorption [22-30]. We define the direction of electric field 
oscillation of light parallel (TE-polarized) and perpendicular (TM-polarized) to the substrate. 
Incident light having its electric field aligned parallel to the polymer main chains—i.e., the 
orientation of the transition dipole moments—will result in π–π* absorption [31]. Thus the optical 
properties become anisotropic when there is a high degree of main chain alignment and extension. 
There are three possible crystalline orientations of P3HT:PCBM thin films [32], with the most 
preferred having the main chains of polymer nanocrystallites aligned parallel to the surface. If the 
electric field of the incident light is parallel to this preferred main chain orientation, the 
absorption of light will be significant. Therefore, TE- and TM- polarized rays of light exhibit 
different absorption behavior because of the perpendicular and parallel directions, respectively, of 
their electric fields with respect to the alignment of the polymer main chains. Measuring the 
reflectance and transmittance spectra of polarized light over a range of incident angles reveals the 
optical anisotropic properties of P3HT:PCBM blends [28]. 
In this study, we examined the influence of bending (radius of curvature) and irradiation at 
oblique incident angles on the external quantum efficiencies of flexible OPVs. To characterize the 
external quantum efficiency loss, we measured the transmittances and reflectances at the multiple 
interfaces using different types of polarized light over a wide range of incident angles. The 
influences of the regioregularity (RR) and annealing temperature on optical anisotropy have been 
reported previously in our researches [28]. Here, we demonstrate that optical anisotropy leads to 
obvious anisotropy of absorption for organic solar cells. This phenomenon reduces the efficiency 
of OPVs toward TM-polarized light at large incident angles. Furthermore, the reflectance of 
TE-polarized light increases dramatically upon increasing the incident angle. Both factors reduce 
the external quantum efficiency of OPV when illuminated at large incident angles. Finally, we 
suggested textured flexible substrates fabricated by nanoimprint lithography to effectively 
enhance the efficiency of OPVs at oblique angles.

One of greatest advantages of the RIM process is that metal films featuring various profiles 
can be readily fabricated and replicated from various molds subjected to low imprinting 
pressures. Thin gold films can be transferred from the surfactant-coated mold to the 
resist-coated substrate under extremely low pressure (<0.1 MPa) because of the surface energy 
difference between the surfactant and adhesion promotion layer of the UV-cured resist. In this 
study, we used an SU-8 film as the adhesion promotion layer for the metal film in our reversal 
imprint process. Fig. 2 presents images of the molds and their transferred metal structures after 
performing the RIM process. Fig. 2(a) reveals the structure of a pyramid-shaped mold having a 
height of 120 nm and a period of 400 nm. After performing the RIM process, we obtained a 
corrugated gold film having a period of 400 nm (Fig. 2(b)). This RIM technology can be used 
to prepare metal films featuring various configurations; the contact surface profile between the 
gold film and the resist determines the morphology of the transferred metal film. Fig. 2(c) 
displays the image of a silicon mold having a feature depth of 900 nm, a hole diameter of 400 
nm, and a period of 800 nm. Patterning of the contact area between the gold film and the 
polymer provided a flat gold film possessing periodic holes (Fig. 2(d)). We attribute to two 
main factors to the relative ease with which we used the RIM approach to fabricate the various 
profiles in these thin gold films: (i) the surface profiles of the areas in contact with the resist 
during the imprinting process and (ii) the thickness of thin metal film on the molds’ sidewall. 
That is to say, the contact profile and thickness of thin gold film on the molds’ sidewall 
determine which parts of the gold film become transferred. The pattern of the reversal imprint is 
limited by the adherent ability provided by the UV-cured polymer.

height of 1 μm and a period of 800 nm was used in the imprinting processes. We employed an 
HDP-RIE system to fabricate molds exhibiting various profiles. The mold displayed in Fig. 3(b) 
was similar to that in Fig. 2(c), but it featured sharper structures on the top of its features. The

The 3D-FDTD method was used to analyze the near-field optical behavior of the AR 
structures. The detectors in the FDTD simulations were placed at positions below the Si substrate 
to compute the transmitted power flux of the propagating wave, because only transmitted light 
can be converted to an electrical current. 
Pyramidal structures were fabricated on Si substrates on micrometer and sub-micrometer 
scales using conventional KOH wet etching and sequential electron-beam lithography/reactive 
ion etching, respectively. A transformer-coupled plasma reactive ion etcher (TCP-RIE) and the 
reactive gases Cl2, HBr, CF4, and SF6 were used to fabricate the pyramidal structures. 
The mechanism of the autocloning effect is displayed in Fig. 1(b). The deposition and 
sputter etching processes were performed alternately. First, deposition of films was performed 
during the CVD or sputtering process. Next, sputter etching and corner chopping with an 
angular-dependent etching were performed. Sputter etching is a physical etching process, 
operating without chemical reaction, for thin-films; it usually operates under low pressure with an 
Ar ion plasma. The sputter-etching rate of the step corner will be faster than the removal of the 
thin films from the surface. Hence, the slope angle of the step corner will be retained. By 
balancing these two phenomena, the surface shapes remain the same before and after each 
processing cycle. Therefore, the corrugated shapes can be duplicated one after another. In this 
study, cross-section profiles of AR structures were observed using a JEOL JSM-6500F scanning 
electron microscope. The optical properties were measured using a Jasco V-570 
spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere.

Part A: Extraordinary transmittance in three-dimensional crater, pyramid, and hole-array 
structures prepared through reversal imprinting of metal films 
 
Fig. 4 displays the transmittance spectra of 45-nm gold films with and without corrugated 
structures. Since the curvature of corrugated gold structures is a key factor for extraordinary 
transmittance [15], we set suitable architecture for corrugated gold films which lead to significant 
SPR induced phenomena. A SPR transmittance enhancement can be obtained in the corrugated 
gold films having a period of 400nm and a height of 120nm which is attributed to its larger 
curvature than the larger period structures. The spectrum of the flat gold film features only the 
intrinsic peak for gold at 510 nm. The transmission of this intrinsic signal varied only with 
respect to the thickness of the gold film. The transmission spectrum of the corrugated gold film 
having a period of 400 nm reveals that SPR, induced by the periodic metal structure, caused the 
transmittance peak to shift to 530 nm, with the peak intensity increasing to 27.2% from the value 
of 19.5% of the flat gold film. We attribute this slight enhancement in the degree of transmission 
to the mismatch in the refractive indexes on the two sides of the corrugated gold film (i.e., the 
two-layer structure air/corrugated gold film/resist). This refractive index mismatch leads to 
insignificant overlap of SPR coupling on the two sides of the patterned gold film. To increase the 
degree of extraordinary transmittance, we coated a resist layer onto the corrugated gold film. The 
transmission of the corrugation gold film covered with SU-8 (i.e., the three-layer structure 
resist/corrugated gold film/resist) increased dramatically to 46.2% at 600 nm as a result of 
refractive index matching. That is, the SPR on each side of the corrugated gold film exhibited the 
same wave vector; overlap of these two SPR signals resulted in strong coupling of light. 
Therefore, the refractive indices at the two surfaces of a patterned gold film play an important 
role in affecting the degree of SPR-induced extraordinary transmittance.

Fig. 6. Gold films on a glass substrate coated with SU-8, possessing (a) periodic empty holes 
and (b) periodic holes filled with SU-8. 
 
Fig. 7 displays transmission spectra of the empty and resist-filled gold hole-array structures. 
In the empty hole-array structure (the two-layer structure air/empty hole-array/resist), the 
transmission peak for the SPR mode of the air–gold interface appeared at 1325 nm with an 
intensity of 37.6%. In the corresponding resist-filled hole-array structure, the peak transmittance 
increased to 50.8% at the same wavelength because of the cavity effect; i.e., the resist filling the 
holes increases the effective optical path length of the cavities and, therefore, the amplitude of the 
SP waves is more confined within the holes. Moreover, because the SPR peaks of the empty and 
resist-filled hole-arrays resonated at the same wavelength, we conclude that the same SPR modes 
were induced by the same interfacial medium (air–gold). The transmittance of the hole-array 
structure coated with an additional resist layer (the three-layer structure resist/resist-filled 
hole-array/resist) was higher transmission: 57.8% at 1465 nm. This three-layer structure induced 
a stronger SPR as a result of the index matching effect. The red-shift in the wavelength of the 
SPR implies that the SPR mode changed to the resist–gold mode on the surface of three-layer 
structure.

Part B Using autocloning effects to develop broad-bandwidth, omnidirectional 
antireflection structures for silicon solar cells 
 
First, we used the RCWA method to simulate the relationship between the pyramidal structure 
size and the surface reflection. Fig. 2(a) displays normal-incidence reflectance spectra of 
close-packed pyramidal Si structures having periods of 0.1 (black line), 0.5 (red line), and 5 (blue 
line) μm. We fixed the ratio of the structure height to the period at 0.7. Fig. 2(a) reveals that the 
reflectance of the structure having a period of 0.1 μm was high for the small structure height. We 
also find that the reflectance was less than 5% in the visible and NIR regimes for the structure 
having a period of 0.5 μm. Increasing the period to 5 μm caused the reflectance to increase, 
because structures having large periods possess poor gradient indices. Fig. 2(b) displays the 
average reflectance at normal incidence for the various pyramidal structures. Here, we fixed the 
aspect ratios of the pyramidal structures at 0.7, close to that of the real structures etched in base. 
The average reflectance decreased upon decreasing the period because the sub-wavelength 
structures exhibited superior gradient index behavior. If the structure height is small, however, 
the average reflectance will be increased.

periods. 
To analyze the angular-dependence Ravg (θ) of the different light trapping structures, we 
computed the average reflectance with respect to the incident angle. Fig. 3(a) presents the values 
of Ravg (θ) of the pyramidal structures having periods of 0.5 and 5 μm. Although the structure 
having a period of 0.5 μm exhibited a value of Ravg (θ) of ca. 3.5% at normal incidence, this value 
increased to more than 15% upon increasing the incident angle to 60°. In contrast, the structure 
having a period of 5 μm exhibited higher average reflectance for light at normal incidence, but its 
reflectance remained at ca. 7.5% for incident angles ranging from 0 to 60°. Overall, the pyramid 
structures having periods of 0.5 and 5 μm had a similar average reflectance (Rtotal-avg) of ca. 7.5% 
over the range of incident angles from 0 to 60°. Fig. 3(b) displays the reflectance spectra of a 
conventional single-layer film of Si3N4, having an optical thickness of one quarter wavelength, at 
incident angles of 0 (blue) and 60° (red). A single-layer AR coating reduces the reflectance 
through destructive interference of reflected light; only light of a specific wavelength and 
 22
reflectance at an incident angle of 60° was at most 2.1%, with an average reflectance of only 
0.78%. Although the high aspect ratio of this nanotip structure provided superior AR behavior 
relative to that of other AR structures, using this kind of structure introduces several problems, 
including surface defects and poor diffusion and optical properties. We discuss the optical 
behavior of the nanotip structure in further detail in our description below of the near-field 
simulations. 
In this study, instead of using oblique deposition to form ultralow-refractive-index AR 
coatings or threadlike nanotip structures, we combined multilayer optical thin films [Fig. 4(a)] 
with a textured Si surface to form an autocloned multilayer AR structure [Fig. 4(b)]. Fig. 4(c) 
displays the periodically autocloned structure that we prepared on a Si substrate using the 
autocloning technique. The SEM image reveals that the SiNx/SiO2 films, which had a total 
thickness greater than 2 μm, each followed the shape of the textured Si surface; thus, the 
autocloning technique can be used to generate multilayer optical thin films.

Figs. 4(d) and (e) display the reflectance spectra of the autocloned pyramid structures having 
periods of 0.5 and 5 μm, respectively. When the three-layer autocloned AR coatings described in 
Fig. 3(c) were deposited on the pyramidal structures of these textured Si surfaces, the reflectance 
from both structures decreased dramatically over the entire range of working wavelengths of a Si 
solar cell. The values of Ravg (θ) at normal incidence decreased from 3.76 to 0.21% for the 
 24
larger incident angles, this kind of pyramidal structure would not be suitable as an 
omnidirectional AR structure for Si solar cells. 
Figs. 6(c) and (d) display the electric field distributions of plane waves propagating toward a 
pyramidal structure possessing a three-layer autocloned film at normal incidence and at an 
incident angle of 45°, respectively. The presence of the autocloned films on the pyramidal 
structures provided superior AR properties relative to the unmodified Si pyramidal structures. 
The three-layer autocloned films reduced the refractive index gap between air and Si, thereby 
increasing the amount of transmitted light and decreasing the amount of total escaped light. 
Comparing Figs. 6(b) and (d) reveals that the autocloned films greatly reduced the reflection of 
light at large incidence angles.

0.5 μm (c) at normal incidence and (d) at an incident angle of 45°. 
Next, we analyzed the transmitted waves of the light propagating through the textured Si 
surfaces. Because the absorption of light in the depletion regions near p–n junctions in solar cells 
is more effective than at other positions, the electric field induced by the built-in voltage can 
separate electron/hole pairs, resulting in electric current. Figs. 7(a–c) display the electric field 
distributions resulting from plane waves propagating into (a, b) autocloned pyramid structures 
[having periods of (a) 5 and (b) 0.5 μm] and (c) high-aspect-ratio nanotips (having a period of 
200 nm and a height of 1.6 μm); the depletion regions in these structures are highlighted by 
dotted lines. Conventionally, doping processes are performed through thermal diffusion of 
dopants to fabricate p–n junctions in solar cells. Diffusion is an isotropic process that generally 
forms highly doped regions away from the Si surface. In Fig. 7(a), we observe that the junction 
formed along the autocloned surface of the pyramidal structure having a period of 5 μm. Because 
of the limitations of the thermal diffusion process, it is generally difficult to form a continuous 
doped region near the surface of a rough structure having a scale of less than 500 nm. Therefore, 
to fabricate a continuous doping region that would retain the conduction of the photocurrent, the 
p–n junction should be formed below the bottom of the sub-wavelength pyramid and nanotip 
structures, as displayed in Figs. 7(b) and (c), respectively.

and to allow the incident light to be distributed over the total area of the OPV. To characterize the 
influence of bending on the transparency of P3HT:PCBM-based organic solar cells, we used both 
non-polarized and polarized light (wavelength: 510 nm) to measure the transmittance and 
absorbance. Fig. 1a displays the transmittance of ITO-coated PC substrates (12 mm 　 12 mm) 
bent at various radii of curvature. We observed 80% transmittance from the flat ITO/PC substrate 
(radius of curvature: ∞) under random polarized light. Its transmittance gradually decreased to 
65% when the radius of curvature decreased to 4 mm. Next, we tested the transmittance of 
polarized light to characterize the optical behavior of the OPVs. The transmittance of 
TE-polarized light exhibited a similar decline as that of the randomly polarized light, decreasing 
from 80 to 57%. In contrast, the transmittance of TM-polarized light initially increased from 80 
to 85% as the radius of curvature decreased from 12 to 6.5 mm and then decreased to 73% at 4 
mm. This behavior suggests that (i) the decreased transmittance of TE-polarized light contributes 
greatly to the declining transmittance of random polarized light and (ii) severe bending causes 
ITO/PC substrates to exhibit relatively low transmittance as a result of their large reflectance. 
Fig. 1b displays the effective extinction coefficients of a P3HT:PCBM blend (1:0.8, w/w) 
film coated on a flexible substrate bent at various radii of curvature. We determined the 
extinction coefficients of P3HT:PCBM blend films at 510 nm from reflectance–transmittance 
(R–T) and ellipsometry measurements and subsequent fitting of the measured reflectance and 
transmittance data to a dispersion function (an oscillator model describing the dielectric function). 
The extinction coefficient measured using randomly polarized light (blue line) decreased from 
0.72 to 0.65 when the radius of curvature decreased from ∞ to 4 mm. Next, we determined the 
extinction coefficients of the film toward TM- and TE-polarized light over a range of radii of 
curvature. The effective extinction coefficient of the film under TM-polarized light (green line) 
decreased from 0.72 to 0.60 upon decreasing of radius of curvature. In contrast, for TE-polarized 
light, the film maintained an extinction coefficient of ca. 0.72 at all radii of curvature (red line). 
These measurements reveal that bending influences the degrees of interfacial transmittance and 
optical absorption of the active layer. The efficiency of a bent solar cell would suffer from light 
impinging on different positions of its curved substrate at various incident angles. Indeed, its 
absorption will be averaged from the contributions of each incident angle of light. 
We measured the crystallinity of P3HT:PCBM blend films subjected to various thermal 
annealing treatments to investigate the effect of bending on their extinction coefficients.  Many 
crystallization treatment processes such as thermal annealing and solvent annealing were applied 
for regaining the extended and aligned P3HT [28]. Because PCBM diffuses into larger aggregates 
 28
substrate and fewer chains in the P3HT:PCBM blend were crystallized in this direction. 
Therefore, the varying of the extinction coefficient under bending, as indicated in Fig. 1b, was 
correlated to the anisotropic crystallinity of the P3HT:PCBM blend.  
Next, we consider the absorbance of the P3HT:PCBM blend in an OPV. A multilayer 
thin-film model was used to calculate the absorbance of the P3HT:PCBM blend when an 
aluminum electrode was presented. The existence of the aluminum electrode led to a strong 
optical interference effect.34 Optical interference would influence the amount of light that 
reached into the active layer, and thus resulted in different absorbance. Therefore, we calculated 
the absorbance of P3HT:PCBM blend fluctuates with different thicknesses. To further verify the 
absorption property of the P3HT:PCBM blend, we normalized our calculated absorbance to the 
penetrating light intensity. The normalized absorbance would correspond to the intrinsic 
absorption property of the P3HT:PCBM blend. Fig. 3a and 3b display the normalized absorbance 
mapping and peak values of the extinction coefficients (510 nm) for active layers of various 
thicknesses under oblique incidence of TE-and TM-polarized light, respectively. For the 
P3HT:PCBM blends having different thicknesses, the normalized absorbance under TE-polarized 
light illumination did not vary with various incident angles. The results were well agreeable with 
those in Fig. 2c. The phenomenon attributed to that the TE-polarized light had an electric field 
direction permanently parallel to the crystalline direction of P3HT, and thus kTE would maintain 
a constant value at all incident angles. However, as displayed in Fig. 3b, the normalized 
absorbance under TM-polarized light decreased much at large angles in all thicknesses due to the 
optical anisotropy effect. The absorbance of the active layer under TE-polarized light did not 
decrease with various incident angles whereas the one under TM-polarized light declined largely 
at large incident angles. The simulation results gave us an inspiration that the optical anisotropy 
effect was still a significant issue in all P3HT:PCBM based OPV even if the optical interference 
had been considered.  
Moreover, we investigated the influence of the incident angle on the interfacial transmission 
and reflection. In our organic solar cells, incoming light would encounter four interfaces prior to 
reaching the active layer: the air–PC substrate, PC substrate–ITO, 
ITO–poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and 
PEDOT:PSS–P3HT:PCBM interfaces. Fig. 4 displays the angle-dependent reflectances of the 
TE- and TM-polarized light at the various interfaces. When TE-polarized light (510 nm) 
encountered the outer air–PC substrate interface, its reflectance increased from 4 to 55% upon 
increasing the incident angle from 0 to 80°. The reflectance at each of the other interfaces, 
however, did not increase significantly, remaining less than 10% for all incident angles. The 
Fresnel equation of TE-polarized light is

TM-polarized light changed upon changing the incident angle, the anisotropic crystallinity of 
P3HT:PCBM strongly reduced the absorption of TM-polarized light (Fig. 2d) at large incident 
angles and, therefore, decreased the values of JSC and efficiency. 
To verify that the anisotropic crystallinity of P3HT:PCBM caused the efficiency of the TM 
mode to decrease, we examined the behavior of a corresponding Si solar cell exhibiting only a 
slight degree of optical anisotropy [32]. Fig. 6a displays the normalized values of JSC of this 
Si-based solar cell at various incident angles. The value of JSC under TE-polarized light 
decreased from 0.8 to 0.2, with the interfacial transmittance (insert) decreasing from 65 to 17%, 
upon increasing the incident angle from 0 to 80°. In contrast, the value of JSC under 
TM-polarized light increased upon increasing the incident angle because of the relatively high 
interfacial transmittance (or low surface reflectance) of TM-polarized light at large incident 
angles, due to the Brewster angle effect. Fig. 5b displays the normalized values of JSC for the 
large optical anisotropy of the P3HT:PCBM-based organic solar cell at various incident angles; 
the inset displays its interfacial transmittance. Similar to the behavior of the Si solar cell, the 
value of JSC of the organic solar cell under TE-polarized light decreased from 0.80 to 0.36 upon 
increasing the incident angle—again, as a result of interfacial reflection. In contrast to the 
behavior of the Si solar cell, the value of JSC under TM-polarized light decreased from 0.80 to 
0.43 despite an increase in transmittance from 84 to 95%. The result clearly implies that the 
decrease in the value of JSC arose mainly from the small absorption of TM-polarized light at 
large incident angles, due to the anisotropic crystallinity of the P3HT:PCBM films. 
Bending or operating an OPV at a large incident angle influences its performance as a result 
of decreasing the interfacial transmittance and decreasing the absorption of TM-polarized light, 
due to optical anisotropy of the P3HT:PCBM film. To enhance the device efficiency when 
bending or illuminating at large incident angles, it is necessary to minimize the optical anisotropy 
of the P3HT:PCBM films and the interface reflection at large incident angles. Unfortunately, the 
anisotropic absorption of P3HT:PCBM films is an intrinsic property because the P3HT:PCBM 
blend tends to crystallize in a direction parallel to the substrate (i.e., in contrast to the electric 
field of TM-polarized light at large incident angles). Upon increasing the incident angle, the 
electric field of TM-polarized light is aligned increasingly perpendicular to the substrate, thereby 
decreasing the amount of light absorbed. This phenomenon results in high-crystallinity 
P3HT:PCBM exhibiting high optical anisotropy and, therefore, significantly reduced absorption 
of TM-polarized light at large incident angles. Unlike Si-based solar cells, organic solar cells 
based on P3HT:PCBM blend films exhibit an additional feature—anisotropic absorption—that 
strongly influences the efficiency under illumination at large incident angles. In this regard, a 
solution to the problem of external quantum efficiency loss at large incident angles would benefit 
the further development of organic solar cells. To enhance the absorption of TM-polarized light 
at large angles, one approach would be to crystallize the chains of P3HT:PCBM in the blend in a 
direction perpendicular to the substrate. 
Of its three possible crystalline orientations [28], the most preferred orientation for P3HT is 
that in which its main chains lie in the plane of the substrate with the side chains presented

Fig. 8a displays the measured reflectance spectra of the PC substrates, in the presence and 
absence of the textured moth-eye structure, under TE- and TM-polarized light. For TE-polarized 
light, the textured structure exhibited a broadband antireflection relative to that of the flat PC 
substrate at an incident angle of 70°; the moth-eye textured structure featured a ca. 10% 
reflectance, significantly lower than that (40%) of the flat PC substrate, at this incident angle. For 
TM-polarized light, Fig. 8a reveals that the flat PC substrate exhibited low reflectance, due to the 
Brewster angle effect. After patterning the moth-eye structure onto the PC substrate, we observed 
a similar reflectance spectrum, implying that the moth-eye antireflection structure had only a 
slight effect on the TM-polarized light at large incident angles. Fig. 8b presents the 
angle-dependent reflectances of the structures under TE- and TM-polarized light. The textured 
PC substrate exhibited a wide-angle antireflection phenomenon for TE-polarized light; its 
reflectance decreased from 10 to 3% at normal incidence and from 45 to 10% at an incident angle 
of 70°. Under TM-polarized light, the reflectance of the PC substrates, both with and without the 
moth-eye structure, was ca. 5–10% at all incident angles. These results reveal that the moth-eye 
structure significantly reduced the reflectance of the TE-polarized light, causing more 
TE-polarized light to reach to the active layer when the textured structure was present on the PC 
substrate. Because of the optical anisotropy of P3HT:PCBM blend films at large incident angles, 
the absorption of TE-polarized light is much greater than that of TM-polarized light. By 
patterning the textured structure onto a PC substrate, the inefficient absorption of TE-polarized 
light, due to large angle reflection, can be alleviated. Our findings imply that moth-eye structures 
might enhance device efficiency when bent or operated at large incident angles because it would 
permit more TE-polarized light to enter the active layer. For a theoretical study, we employed the 
finite difference time domain (FDTD) method for near-field simulation. Fig. 8c displays the 
simulated results for a bent PC substrate prepared with and without the moth-eye antireflection 
structure. For an incident wavelength of 510 nm, the simulations reveal an obvious reflection of 
light above the bent substrate lacking the textured structure. For the textured, bent PC substrate, 
the amount of reflected light was minimal, consistent with our experimental measurements.  
Finally, we further utilized the nanoimprint lithography to fabricate an antireflection structure 
for improving the efficiency of practical OPVs. The as-fabricated device has an efficiency of 3.23 
under normal incidence. For the ease of comparison, we normalized the angle-dependent 
efficiency to that of normal incidence. Fig. 8d displays the normalized efficiency of the devices in 
the absence or presence of an antireflection structure under TE-polarized light illumination and 
the inserted graph was the IV- curve of the device under normal incidence. At incident angles 
smaller than 20°, both devices exhibit similar efficiencies due to the low reflectance of a PC 
substrate at small incidence angles. As increasing the incident angle, however, the functioning of 
the antireflection structure was apparently observed. The normalized efficiency of the device with 
an antireflection structure maintained 0.95 at 60°, and still remained a high value of 0.65 even at 
80°. In contrast, the normalized efficiency of the device without an antireflection structure 
strongly decreased to 0.69 at 60°, and further dropped to 0.24 at 80°. The experimental results 
indicated that a moth-eye textured antireflection structure could effectively increase the 
efficiency of P3HT:PCBM based OPVs at large incident angles.

omnidirectional AR properties, it possessed several disadvantageous features, including poor 
contact with electrodes and large amounts of light absorbed by the tips before it could reach the 
junction. In an experimental study, we found that the measured reflectance of an autocloned 
structure was less than 4% for wavelengths in the range from 400 to 1000 nm and incident angles 
from 0 to 60°. Therefore, the autocloning technique combined with optical thin films is a 
practical and compatible approach for the fabrication of broad-bandwidth, omnidirectional AR 
structures for Si solar cells. This autocloning method has great potential for practical applications, 
because this method does not need to largely change the manufacture process of a silicon solar 
cell. 
In the third part of this project, The combination of optical anisotropy of P3HT:PCBM blend 
films and interfacial reflection results in a loss of external efficiency for organic solar cells that 
are bent or illuminated at large incident angles. The measured efficiencies of such devices 
decrease significantly at large incident angles—especially under TM-polarized light, where 
anisotropic absorption of the active layer occurs, in contrast to the increased efficiency of 
Si-based solar cells. Simulations of the reflectance at multiple interfaces revealed that light was 
reflected mostly at the outermost air–flexible substrate interface, due to its largest refractive index 
difference. To alleviate this reflection loss, we used nanoimprint lithography to fabricate textured 
antireflection structures on flexible substrates. Experimental results and simulations confirmed 
that the presence of the textured structures led to obvious reductions in the degrees of interfacial 
reflection under TE-polarized light. As a result, more TE-polarized light, which is absorbed 
strongly in P3HT:PCBM films, can reach to the active layer of the OPV. An obvious efficiency 
enhancement was observed at oblique incidence when the device was made with a moth-eye 
antireflection structure. Therefore, we would expect the increased efficiency of such textured 
organic solar cells when they are bent or illuminated at large incident angles.

closely connected in horizontal plane without gaps between them. In general, the sheet 
resistance of an uniform conductor thin film with thickness h and resistivity ρcan be 
described by Rsh=ρ/ h in units of Ω/sq. The sheet resistance of 1D regular array is 
analogous to sheet resistance as used in uniform conductor thin film by grouping the 
resistivity with the thickness. In our case, the unit thickness of 1D regular array is the 
diameter of CNT.  The parallel resistance of the 1D regular array of CNTs can be regarded 
as the effective sheet resistance of CNT based wire for an electrical current along the CNTs. 
As displayed in Fig. 1b, when the closely 1D regular array of CNTs are separated and 
forming gaps in the array. The array of CNTs has a periodicity P and the effective sheet 
resistance for an electrical current along the CNTs can be calculated In our simulation, a 
CNT was treated as a sheet of graphene rolled up into a hollow cylindrical shell with a 
local dielectric tensor given by the references [3-4]. 
The three dimensional finite difference time domain (3D-FDTD) method was used to 
simulate optical properties of 1D regular array of CNTs in this work.

regular array of CNTs with a intertube distance P, where P is larger than D.  
 
 
Results and Discussion 
We investigated the anisotropic optical behavior of closely 1D regular array of CNTs, 
as displayed in the inset of Fig. 2. In this study, the CNTs diameter was chosen to be 10 nm, 
the length was infinite, and the wavelength in the regime of 350-2000 nm was simulated, 
since most LEDs and photovoltaic cells operate within this range. For this 1D regular 
arrays of CNTs, the transverse electric (TE, magnetic field parallel to the axial of CNTs) 
and transverse magnetic (TM, electric field parallel to the axial of CNTs) polarizations can 
be analyzed independently. We investigate the transmittance spectra of TE, TM, and 
averaged of TE and TM polarization separately. As displayed in Fig. 2, the transmittance 
spectra of TE polarization are much higher than TM polarization light because the 
geometry arrays of CNTs. The groove effect results from an optical field confined within 
the groove. The maximum transmittance is ca. 90%. The 3D-FDTD approache provides the 
behavior of incident light through the model evolving over time. The maximum
