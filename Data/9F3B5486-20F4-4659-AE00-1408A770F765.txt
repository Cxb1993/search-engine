PARTⅠ：Preparation of latex particles: one to one copy of 
monomer droplets via a modified miniemulsion 
polymerization 
 
ABSTRACT: 
One to one copy the monomer droplets to latex particles was 
fulfilled entirely via a modified miniemulsion polymerization in 
this work when the initiator, 2,2'-Azobisisobutyronitrile, was used. 
The character of the modified process was that polymerization was 
not carried out after homogenization immediately and enough 
equilibrium time was provided for the miniemulsion to reach a 
more stable state. The advantage of the modified process was that, 
the size distribution was narrow and the particle size was 
adjustable from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. 
The larger latex particles could be obtained with 100% droplet 
nucleation mechanism for this modified process rather than the 
smaller ones produced in our earlier work from a conventional 
miniemulsion polymerization. Moreover, it was possible to 
preserve the one-to-one feature of latex particles even though the 
costabilizer was absent. The importance of costabilizer for 
miniemulsion polymerization was related to the surfactant 
concentration. When initiator was changed from oil soluble to 
water soluble, the feature of one-to-one disappeared, that was 
because the fluctuation was large and the stability of droplets was 
destroyed when free radicals were generated in aqueous phase.

INTRODUCTION 
In conventional emulsion polymerization, droplets with size 
larger than μm served as a monomer reservoir and latex particles 
nucleated either in monomer swollen micelles or aqueous phase[1, 
2]. However, in miniemulsion polymerization, the size of droplets 
was reduced substantially to 50nm-500nm[3] by variety of 
homogenized process such as ultrasonication[4-6], high-pressure 
homogenizer[7, 8]and other high shear devices[9]. The droplets 
with more O/W surface area could compete with micelles to 
capture free radicals. As a result, monomer droplets could act as a 
nanoreactors and polymerized in situ, that was called droplet 
nucleation[10, 11]. Because of the characteristic of miniemulsion 
polymerization, the size distributions of monomer droplets should 
be identical to latex particles ideally. Unfortunately, 
homogeneous/micellar nucleation could not be rule out in most 
cases in fact. One reason was the stability of miniemulsion was 
insufficient to resist coalescence and Ostwald ripening. 
Coalescence could be avoided by adequate amount of ionic or 
nonionic surfactant to stabilize the O/W surface from droplet 
collision. The cause of Ostwald ripening was due to that the 
solubility of monomer in water was increasing with decreasing 
monomer droplets size and the size of larger monomer droplets 
grew by expensing smaller monomer droplets.[12-14] In order to 
retard destabilization from monomer diffusion, hydrophobic 
costabilizer like fatty alcohols[15] or long-chain alkanes[16, 17] 
were used as trapped species in miniemulsion to build up a 
counteracting osmotic pressure. Webster and Cates[18] established 
the stabilization effect of emulsion with trapped species in droplets 
theoretically. Three regions with different stability of droplets was 
found, RB and RS was the boundary between these three regions, R 
present the radius of droplet and subscripts B and S denoted as 
balance and stability. When the size of droplet was larger than RB 
(regionⅢ), the emulsion was unstable and droplet would coarsen 
immediately. If the size of droplets was smaller than RS (regionⅠ), 
the emulsion was fully stable. In region Ⅱ, the size of droplet lied 
between RB and RS, the emulsion was metastable, coarsening 
occurred when there was a fluctuation in local environment of 
droplet or a few larger droplets existed in the initial state. 
In our previous study and other researches, polymerization was 
carried out immediately after miniemulsion was homogenized, and 
the kinetics or nucleation mechanism was investigated[19-22]. In 
this way, homogenized energy was an important factor to control 
the size and stability of monomer droplets, if the homogenized 
energy was insufficient to get the critically stabilized size of 
monomer droplets, the emulsion was in an unstable region, 
 3
Fig. 1. It revealed that under low homogenized energy, size of 
most droplets ranged from 400nm to 550nm initially. However, 
because the emulsion was in an unstable state, monomer diffusion 
kept going on, some droplets would shrink and others coarsen by 
Ostwald ripening. As the equilibrium time was set as 1hr, 3hr, 6hr 
or 24hr, the size of the shrinking droplets changed to 100-550nm, 
100-450nm, 100-200nm and 100-200nm respectively. The 
shrinking phenomenon was fast in the initial stage and became 
slower when approaching or achieving the metastable state. 
Although the change of droplets size was insignificant after 6hr, 
several factors like temperature or composition could alter the 
equilibrium time. As a result, 24hr was chosen as a fixed 
equilibrium time for our further experiment.  
 
Latex particles showing a one to one copy of the monomer 
droplets 
AIBN was the initiator; the concentrations of surfactant and 
costabilizer were 0.2g and 44mM respectively as shown in Table 1. 
Anionic surfactant SDS, cationic surfactant CTAC and nonionic 
surfactant Tween 20 were used respectively to stabilize the O/W 
surface and the size distributions of droplets and latex particles 
with different surfactants were shown in Fig. 2. The figure 
revealed that size distributions of droplets and latex particles were 
quite similar for each surfactant. It implied that the droplet 
nucleation was nearly 100% in our system, latex particles showed 
a one to one copy of the monomer droplets when miniemulsion 
was situated in a more stable state. The size and distribution of 
latex particles with different surfactants were also verified by 
TEM photographs in Fig. 7(a),(b) and (c). When the surfactant was 
CTAC, the size was smaller and ranged from 100nm to 200nm, 
otherwise, the size ranged from 130nm~230nm in other surfactants, 
consistent with the results in our DLS experiment. The difference 
of the size of final latex particles was ascribed to the nature of 
surfactant. 
  
Control of size distribution of latex particles by surfactant 
concentration 
The size distribution of miniemulsion was determined by both 
the processes of droplet fission and fusion [23]. The driving force 
of droplet fission came from high energy of ultrasonication, and 
droplet fusion was controlled by combination of droplet 
coalescence and Ostwald ripening. Higher homogenized energy 
could enhance the droplet fission and latex particles with smaller 
size would be obtained[24]. If the droplet fusion was promoted by 
droplet coalescence or Ostwald ripening, the size of monomer 
droplets would shift to a larger value[25]. 
In our experiments, AIBN was the initiator, the concentration of 
costablizer was 44mM, and the droplet fission was fixed by 10min 
ultrasonication with 50% amplitude output. The surfactant 
concentration changed from 3mM, 6mM to 30mM. From the 
comparison of size distributions of monomer droplets and latex 
particles with different surfactant concentrations in Fig. 3, the 
latex particles always showed the one to one copy of monomer 
droplets and the particle size increased with decreasing the 
surfactant concentration. The reason of the size changing was that 
more surfactant could stabilize more O/W surfaces and reduced 
the possibility of droplet coalescence. As the droplet fusion was 
retarded by higher concentration of surfactant, the size of droplets 
would be smaller as expected. TEM photographs in Fig. 7(c),(d) 
and (e) also verified the results in DLS, when surfactant 
concentration was from 3mM to 30mM, the range of particle size 
changed from 110nm-250nm to 60nm-200nm. Moreover, in these 
three experiments, the size distributions of latex particles were 
quite narrow when the modified miniemulsion polymerization was 
used compared with the conventional miniemulsion 
polymerization. 
 
Was costabilizer necessary for one to one copy the droplets to 
latex particles?  
The initiator we used was AIBN and costabilizer concentration 
was varied from 0 to 44mM for studying their effects on 
nucleation mechanism of latex particles. In this series of 
experiment, the concentration of surfactant, CTAC, was low, 6mM, 
or high, 30mM. When the surfactant concentration was low, 6mM, 
the size distributions of monomer droplets and latex particles were 
shown in Fig. 4. The results revealed that the latex particles 
showed one to one copy of the monomer droplets as the 
costabilizer concentration was higher than 8.8mM, it presented 
that droplet nucleation dominated during polymerization. However, 
if the costabilizer was absent, two nucleation mechanisms were 
found and the size distribution of latex particles was in a bimodal 
shape, the larger ones came from droplet nucleation and the 
 5
was poor, monomer diffusion from droplets to droplets would 
occur and secondary nucleation was induced in the course of 
polymerization. In our modified process, enough equilibrium time 
was supplied for the homogenized  
miniemulsion. Droplets would redistribute to a more stable state 
during the time of equilibrium. Better stability of miniemulsion 
would provide the possibility of 100% droplet nucleation.    
Based on the modified process, when AIBN was used as an 
initiator, after polymerization, the size distribution of latex 
particles was identical with the monomer droplets no matter the 
surfactant was anionic, cationic or nonionic, It implied that the 
latex particles generated from droplet nucleation.  
The importance of costabilizer was found to be related to the 
concentration of surfactant. If the surfactant concentration was low, 
costabilizer was necessary to carry out an ideal miniemulsion 
polymerization. If higher surfactant concentration was used, the 
O/W surfaces were protected well and monomer diffusion among 
droplets negligible, then latex particles showed one to one copy of 
the monomer droplets even the costabilizer was absent. 
If the initiator was changed from oil soluble to water soluble, the 
one-to-one feature of miniemulsion polymerization no longer 
existed. The phenomenon could be ascribed to two reasons. First, 
KPS increased the polymerization of monomer in aqueous phase 
and particles mostly generated from homogeneous /micellar 
nucleation. Second, the size of droplets increased, which was not 
favorable for the droplet nucleation. 
Using this modified process, the size of latex particles could be 
regulated in a wide ranged from tens of nanometers to hundreds of 
nanometers. An increase of the amount of surfactant or costabilizer 
would decrease the size of latex particles. And the size distribution 
of latex particles remained quite narrow.

magnetic particles. In the meanwhile, parameters which could tune 
the morphology of PS/Fe3O4 composite particles would also be 
discussed. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials 
Styrene was distilled under reduced pressure and was stored at 5℃ 
before use. Hexadecane(HD; Acros), 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile 
(AIBN; Showa), potassium peroxide (KPS; Sigma), dodecyl 
sulphate (SDS; Acros), lauric acid(Acros), sorbitan monolaurate 
(Span 20; Showa) and 28% ammonium hydroxide solution(Acros) 
were used without further purification. Distilled and deionized 
water was used throughout the work. 
 
Preparation of Oil-Based Fe3O4 Particles 
Fe3O4 particles were obtained by coprecipitation of Fe(Ⅱ) and 
Fe(Ⅲ) salts in aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide. In this 
process, 23.5g FeCl3‧6H2O and 8.6g FeCl2‧4H2O were 
dissolved in 400ml deionized water with stirring. Then 50ml of 
28%(w/w) ammonium hydroxide solution was added for 6min. 
Further 2.5g lauric acid was added to the solution under stirring at 
90℃ for 30min to modify the surfaces of Fe3O4 particles to 
become hydrophobic in nature. Finally, the supernatant solution 
was decanted and the black modified Fe3O4 residue was washed 
with methanol for three times to remove non-bonded lauric acid. 
Then the precipitates were lyophilized for 24hr to obtain oil-base 
Fe3O4 particles. 
 
Preparation of PS/Fe3O4 Composite Particles by Miniemulsion 
Polymeriazation  
All the components required in the experiment were divided into 
three parts. One was aqueous phase, one was oil phase and the 
other was initiator solution. Aqueous phase was composed of 
deionized water and SDS, oil phase was composed of styrene, 
Fe3O4 and HD, and initiator solution was composed of deionized 
water and KPS. All the recipes were listed in Table 1 and the 
amount of deionized water used was 100g. Being mixed for each 
for 10min, then the aqueous phase was added to the oil phase and 
the O/W mixture was mixed for 10min by mechanical stirring for 
pre-emulsification. After that, the O/W mixture was ultrasonicated 
(Dr. Hielscher UP-50H) in an ice bath. The ultrasonication time 
and amplitude were two parameters discussed in the experiment 
and the use of ice bath was to prevent the polymerization 
occurring during ultrosonication. Finally the homogenized 
miniemulsion was poured into 250ml four-necked glass reactor 
equipped with condenser and mechanical stirrer in a water bath. 
The stirring rate was kept at 300 rpm and polymerization was 
carried out by introducing initiator solution for 1hr at 85℃ 
 
Conversion 
The conversion of monomer was determined by gravimetric 
method. During miniemulsion polymerization, certain amount of 
the latex was taken out of the reactor, and poured into a 
hydroquinone methanol solution in an ice bath. Finally, the sample 
was dried in an oven at 85℃ until the weight kept constant. The 
conversion can be calculated by eq(1). P was the weight of dry 
sample from the oven. F was the theoretical weight of Fe3O4 in the 
dry sample. W was the weight of the latex sample and M0 was the 
weight fraction of monomer in feed recipes.

Morphology of PS/Fe3O4 Composite Particles 
The PS/Fe3O4 composite latex was diluted with deionized water. 
Then the sample was dropped on the surface of cooper grids, the 
morphology and particles size could be observed by using JOEL 
JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (TEM) 
 
Size Distributions of Monomer Droplets and Composite Latex 
Particles 
The size distribution of the monomer droplets or composite latex 
particles was measured by laser dynamic light scattering (DLS) 
instrument (Malvern Zeta Sizer 3000H). The latex sample was 
diluted with saturated styrene and SDS solution in order to avoid 
monomer or SDS diffusing from droplets to aqueous solution. 
Each measurement was completed within several minutes, and the 
size distribution was obtained with particle diameter as horizontal 
axis and cumulative volume percentage as vertical axis. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Effect of Content of Fe3O4 
Size distributions of monomer droplets and latex particles with 
 11
particles with different amount of initiator in Figure 7, it indicated 
the nucleation mechanism was dominated by secondary nucleation 
according to emergence of numerous particles smaller than 
original monomer droplets regardless the amount of initiator used. 
Nevertheless, size distributions of latex particles were quite 
different, when amount of initiator increased from 0.3wt% to 
2.5wt%, the distribution became broader and larger particles were 
observed. It could be attributed to the higher ionic strength, 
induced by water soluble initiator, which resulted in compression 
of electrical double layer. Therefore, the stability of particles was 
decreased and coagulation occurred during polymerization. 
  The conversion curves with different amount of initiator were 
showed in Figure 8, it revealed that polymerization rate was 
enhanced as the amount of initiator increased. As expected, free 
radicals were generated from initiator, and more free radicals 
participated in polymerization guaranteed faster reaction. However, 
the final conversion was highly limited when amount of initiator 
was up to 2.5wt%. This phenomenon could be explained by 
diffusion-controlled propagation. In the course of polymerization, 
Tg of polymer/monomer mixture in polymer particles increased. 
As long as the Tg of polymer particles was higher than the 
polymerization temperature, mobility of free radicals was hindered 
and the diffusion-controlled propagation was obvious especially in 
larger particles in I-3. Therefore, polymerization might stop and a 
limiting conversion was observed significantly decreased with 
increasing the initiator concentration. 
  TEM photographs of I-1 and I-3 were showed in Figure 6 and 
Figure 9. The morphology of PS/Fe3O4 latex particles could be 
varied with particle coagulation. In less coagulation recipe, I-1, the 
location of Fe3O4 was on the shell of particles. However, for I-3, 
Fe3O4 particles were most located in the interior of particles due to 
the coagulation of particles.  
 
Effect of amount of surfactant 
The function of surfactant, SDS, was to keep the droplets or 
polymer particles from coalescence and provided enough 
electrostatically repulsive force to maintain the stability of 
monomer droplets or polymer particles. From the comparison of 
size distributions of droplets and latex particles with different 
amount of surfactant in Figure 10, the size of monomer droplets 
was in the order of SDS-3< SDS-2< SDS-1. When the amount of 
surfactant increased, monomer would split into smaller and more 
droplets during the process of ultrasonication. After 
polymerization, the size distribution of latex particles revealed that 
if the concentration of surfactant was 35mM, little coagulation was 
observed; if 20mM, particle coagulation was very significant and 
the size of polymer particles were larger than the original sizes of 
droplets. That was because the amount surfactant was insufficient 
to provide enough stability for droplets or polymer particles. 
Figure 11 showed the conversion curves with different surfactant 
concentration, the polymerization rate was in the order of SDS-3> 
SDS-2>SDS-1. It could be ascribed to that small monomer 
droplets acted as reaction loci and polymerization rate increased 
with increasing the number of droplets, and the average size of 
composite particles decreased. 
   Furthermore, compared the TEM photographs of SDS-2 and 
SDS-3 (shown in Figure 12 and Figure 6), in SDS-3, the location 
of Fe3O4 particles was on the shell of particles. However, for 
SDS-2, some Fe3O4 particles were located in the interior of 
particles. Like I-2, the change of morphology was caused by 
particle coagulation. 
 
Effect of costabilizer 
The role of costabilizer was to suppress molecular diffusion 
(Oswald ripening effect) by introducing osmotic pressure and 
maintain the droplet stability under polymerization. In this series 
of experiment, HD and Span 20 were chosen as two types of 
costabilizer where HD was a highly hydrophobic compound and 
Span 20 was relatively more hydrophilic due to its shorter 
hydrocarbon chain and three hydrophilic hydroxyl functional 
groups. Due to the amphiphilic nature of Span 20, it can also be 
used as a surfactant. Compared with the size distributions of 
droplets and latex particles in Figure 13, the average diameter of 
latex composite particles was smaller than droplets regardless 
what kind of costabilizers was used. It implied that particles 
formed from both secondary nucleation and droplet nucleation. 
Moreover, because of the surfactant role of Span 20, the 
coagulation could be avoided to some extent, thus the particles 
were obtained with smaller size.  
Conversion curves of HD-1 and Span-1 were shown in Figure 
14. When costabilizer was changed from HD to Span 20, the 
polymerization rate was accelerated. It was because that Span 20 
 13
Fe3O4 would be located on the surfaces of particles, and core-shell 
structure of composite particles was observed.

PARTⅢ：Nucleation Mechanism and Morphology of 
Composite Latex Particles, Polystytrene/Fe3O4, via 
Miniemulsion Polymerization using AIBN as Initiator 
 
ABSTRACT: In this research, oil-based Fe3O4 nanoparticles were 
prepared by means of coprecipitation method followed by a 
surface modification using lauric acid. Oil-based Fe3O4 could 
disperse in styrene, and polystyrene/Fe3O4(PS/Fe3O4) composite 
particles were prepared via miniemulsion polymerization in the 
presence of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile(AIBN) as initiator, sodium 
dodecyl sulphate(SDS) as surfactant, hexadecane(HD) or sorbitan 
monolaurate(Span 20) as costabilizer. The effects of Fe3O4 content, 
costabilizer, homogenization energy and surfactant concentration 
on the conversion, size distributions of droplets and latex particles, 
nucleation mechanism and morphology of composite particles 
were investigated. The results showed that high homogenization 
energy, appropriate amount of SDS and more hydrophobic 
costabilizer were necessary to obtain composite particles from 
droplet nucleation. Morphology of magnetic composite particles 
could be well controlled by homogenization energy or 
hydrophobicity of costabilizer. Fe3O4 nanoparticles could be 
located inside latex particles or on the shell of latex particles 
depending on the polymerization conditions. 
 
Keywords: miniemulsion polymerization, nucleation mechanism, 
magnetic latex particles, morphology 
 
INTRODUCTION 
In the past few years, magnetic polymer composite particles have 
drawn more and more attention due to vast applications in several 
fields, such as cell separation1,2, enzyme immobilization3, 
environment and food analysis4, magnetic resonance imaging5 and 
targeting drug delivery6,7. The popularity was caused by its 
sensitivity to magnetic filed applied and could be separated easily 
by magnetic separation. 
  Many polymerization methods have been developed to prepare 
magnetic polymer composite particles, including conventional 
emulsion polymerization8, precipitation polymerization9 
suspension polymerization10, seeded polymerization11, soapless 
emulsion polymerization12, miniemulsion polymerization13-17, and 
so on18. In the method of miniemulsion polymerization, magnetic 
particles were undergone surface modification using organic acid, 
where carboxyl functional group would anchor on the iron atom19, 
and dispersed into the monomer, then, the monomer droplets with 
magnetic particles would act as nanoreactors and polymerization 
proceeded in situ. Lu et al.15 examined the effects of the 
experiment parameters on the encapsulation degree of magnetic 
PS composite particles, such as surfactant concentration, 
hydrophobe concentration, stabilizer and comonomer 
concentration. Ramirez and Landfester16 synthesized magnetic 
polystyrene particles with high magnetite content successfully and 
developed a new three-step miniemulsion preparation route. Lin et 
al.17 produced thermoresponsive magnetic composite particles, 
with Fe3O4 homogeneously distributed in NIPAAm, via W/O 
miniemulsion polymerization. 
  As miniemulsion polymerization was widely taken as an 
effective method to prepare polymer/inorganic composite particles. 
Besides Fe3O4, there were other inorganic particles have been tried 
and investigated. Erdem et al.20 produced TiO2/PS composite 
particles and described the encapsulation efficiency using 
hydrophilic or hydrophobic TiO2 particles in the presence of 
OLOA 370 as stabilizer. Peres et al.21 produced green-emitting 
CdSe/poly(butyl acrylate) nanocomposite particles and 
investigated the morphology and electrical property. In additional, 
carbon black/PS22, ZnO/BA23 and CaCO3/PS24 composite particles 
were also obtained by miniemulsion polymerization. However, no 
matter what the polymerization method or inorganic material were 
used, most of the researches in literature emphasized the 
preparation and characterization, especially in miniemulsion 
polymerization. There were few papers discussing the control of 
morphology and nucleation mechanism in polymer/inorganic 
composite particles. 
  The aim of this paper was to examine how polymerization 
conditions affected the morphology of PS/Fe3O4 composite 
particles, in the meanwhile, nucleation mechanism and 
polymerization kinetics through the course of miniemulsion 
polymerization in the presence of magnetic particles would also be 
discussed.

The value of D was close to the diameter observed from TEM 
(Figure 2). However, the particles diameter from TEM ranged 
from 6nm to 9nm 
 
PS/Fe3O4 Composite Particles 
Effect of the Content of Fe3O4 
Conversion curves of the obtained composite particles with 
different amount of Fe3O4 were shown in Figure 3. With 
increasing the content of the Fe3O4, the polymerization rate and 
final conversion decreased. That was because Fe2+ ions from 
Fe3O4 acted as a free radical quencher to inhibit the 
polymerization17,28. As a result, more Fe3O4 participated in the 
polymerization resulted in less effective free radicals and 
polymerization rate and final conversion would be suppressed. 
Figure 4 shows the size distributions of the initial droplets and 
final latex particles with different Fe3O4 contents. Fe-2, with 20% 
Fe3O4, whose droplet size distribution was broad and ranged from 
300nm to 600nm. For Fe-1, with 10% Fe3O4, droplet size 
distribution shifted to smaller values, 200nm to 500nm, and for 
Fe3O4 free recipes, Fe-0, 50% of the droplets had diameter less 
than 200nm. It revealed that Fe3O4 dispersed in monomer would 
reduce the efficiency of droplets fission during ultrasonication and 
resulted in broader size distribution and larger average diameter of 
droplets.  
  After polymerization, Fe-1 and Fe-2 both had bimodal particle 
size distribution. The part of larger size particles mainly formed 
from the shrinking of original droplets and the part of smaller size 
particles mainly came from secondary nucleation. For Fe-0, 
unimodal particle size distribution was obtained because 
comparative amount of particles from both droplet shrinking and 
secondary nucleation resulted in a continuous distribution. 
Nevertheless, from the comparison of droplet and latex particle 
size distributions in these three experimental conditions, large 
population of composite particles formed from secondary 
nucleation. 
  TEM photographs of the obtained composite particles were 
shown in Figure 5. The results were consistent with the particle 
size distribution curves from dynamic light scattering experiment. 
With higher content of Fe3O4, the size of larger composite particles 
increased. The reason was that larger original droplets resulted in 
larger composite particles even after shrinking. However changing 
the Fe3O4 content would not change the morphology of composite 
particles and the distribution of Fe3O4 in PS latex particles was 
random and quite homogenous. 
 
Effect of the Homogenized Energy 
The homogenization energy applied to the O/W emulsion could be 
varied by adjusting the ultrasonication time and amplitude, the 
longer ultrasonication time and higher ultrasonication amplitude 
reflected more energy. In Figure 6, the conversion curves of the 
composite latex showed that increasing the ultrosinication energy, 
the polymerization rate would be promoted. It appeared that more 
energy applied to the O/W emulsion, the monomer would split into 
more small droplets. In other words, during polymerization, the 
reaction site for droplet nucleation increased and the 
polymerization rate would be enhanced.  
  The explanation could be verified by Figure 7, when 
homogenization energy applied from Energy-1 to Energy-3, the 
droplet distribution would become narrower and the average 
particle size shifted to a smaller value. Furthermore, after 
polymerization, Energy-3 had similar size distribution curve 
between droplets and composite particles. It implied that the 
possibility of secondary nucleation was largely reduced. In other 
words, most particles formed from droplet nucleation. However, 
for Energy-1 and Energy-2, significantly shrinking feature was 
observed due to the fact that the critically stabilized size of 
droplets was not achieved before polymerization. Therefore, the 
secondary nucleation dominated over the droplet nucleation 
especially in the system of Energy-1. It could be concluded that 
homogenization energy played an important role to control the 
nucleation mechanism and enough energy was required to attain 
droplet nucleation. 
  TEM photographs of the synthesized composite particles were 
shown in Figure 5(b) for Energy-1 and in Figure 8 for Energy-3. 
The results showed that the morphology of composite particles

CONCLUSION 
In this work, PS/Fe3O4 composite particles were synthesized 
successfully from miniemulsion polymerization. The conversion 
curves, size distributions of droplets and latex particles, nucleation 
mechanism and morphology were discussed in detail. 
Polymerization rate could be promoted by increasing the number 
of monomer droplets, which could be achieved under the condition 
of high concentration of surfactant, higher homogenization energy 
or changing costabilizer form HD to Span 20. Because of the role 
of Fe2+ from Fe3O4 acted as a free radical quencher, more Fe3O4 
participated in the reaction would reduce the polymerization rate.  
  The size distributions of droplets and latex particles were 
measured and compared to estimate the fraction of droplet 
nucleation. With increasing the Fe3O4 content, the size distribution 
of droplets and latex particles were broader with more population 
of larger particles due to the less efficiency of droplet fission 
during ultrasonication. For high homogenization energy recipe, the 
monomer droplets were critically stabilized, the size distributions 
of monomer droplet and its resulting latex particles were almost 
identical. The function of SDS was to provide stabilization for 
O/W surfaces, an optimum concentration was found. Too much 
surfactant would generate micelles and induced micellar 
nucleation. Insufficient amount of surfactant could not maintain 
the stability of monomer droplets and secondary nucleation could 
not be avoided. The choice of costabilizer was critical too, more 
hydrophobic one, HD, was effective to produce osmotic pressure 
and resist Oswald ripening effect. Thus, the stability of monomer 
droplet was enhanced and polymerization in situ, droplet 
nucleation dominated. 
  Morphology of composite latex particles could be well 
controlled via changing homogenization energy and costabilizer. 
For high homogenization energy recipe, the Fe3O4 located on the 
surface of PS latex particles. It differed from the one with low 
homogenization energy, where Fe3O4 was random and quite 
homogeneously distributed inside the latex particles. It was due to 
that more possibility for Fe3O4 particles to be ultrasonicated out 
from the interior of monomer droplets to surfaces under high 
homogenization energy. When HD was used as a costabilizer, 
random and quite homogeneous morphology could be observed 
for composite particles if homogenization energy was not high. 
However, the core-shell morphology with Fe3O4 on the shell of 
composite particles was observed if Span 20 replaced HD as a 
costabilizer. The more hydrophilic nature of Span 20 changed the 
location of Fe3O4 particles and induced the morphology change. 
The morphology control could afford different applications of 
these magnetic composite particles.

PARTⅣ：Morphology of PU/PMMA Hybrid Particles from 
Miniemulsion Polymerization: Thermodynamic 
Considerations 
 
ABSTRACT: The morphology of PU/PMMA hybrid particles 
prepared by miniemulsion polymerization was predicted through 
the consideration of their Gibbs free energy changes. Five 
morphological states of PU/PMMA hybrid particles were 
proposed and their Gibbs free energy changes were calculated. 
Before the formation of hybrid particles,the initial state included a 
monomer mixture of PU prepolymer, MMA, a chain extender, 
TMP, and an initiator, which was in droplets suspended in water 
containing SDS. Two assumptions were made. First, the densities 
of all states were the same. Secondly, secondary nucleation of 
particles was negligible. Thus the size of initial droplet and final 
particle was unchanged through miniemulsion polymerization. 
The interfacial tensions were measured by a pendant drop method 
and were used for calculation. The preferred morphology of 
PU/PMMA hybrid particle had the minimum value of ΔGphase. 
Different NCO/OH ratios of PU and initiators of MMA were used 
to study the morphological change of PU/PMMA hybrid particles. 
When BD was used as the chain extender of PU, the hybrid 
particles showed the PU-rich phase as the shell and PMMA-rich as 
the core. When incorporating bisphenol A into PU polymer, the 
homogeneous structure of hybrid particle was preferred.  
 
Keywords: morphology; polyurethanes; thermodynamics 
 
INTRODUCTION 
To achieve better mechanical properties and higher colloid 
stability, a hybrid polymer particle containing two polymers is 
generally prepared as designed.1–3 In recent years, miniemulsion 
polymerization is a new way to prepare the hybrid particle. There 
are some documents of preparing core-shell latex through 
miniemulsion polymerization.4–7 However, the morphological 
changes of the hybrid particles with experimental variables, such 
as compositions of monomers, types of initiators, and other 
polymerization conditions, were not fully understood.  
Most polymer blends contain thermodynamically immiscible 
components. Their morphology usually has a larger influence on 
mechanical properties. It is well known that the morphology of 
polymer blends is influenced by the blend composition, 
preparation conditions, and interfacial tension between two 
polymers. Latex system with well-designed particle morphology is 
useful to manufacture advanced engineering plastics with high 
tensile strength, improved toughness, and other high-added values. 
Composite latex particles of different morphologies are usually 
prepared by seeded emulsion polymerization techniques where a 
second monomer is synthesized in the presence of seed latex 
particles. Investigation of the morphology of core-shell latex and 
the factors controlling it are the goal of many papers published in 
previous years. Most researched systems in the literatures are 
PS/PMMA8–10 and PS/PBA.11,12 In these earlier documents, the 
controlling factors fall into two broad categories: thermodynamics 
and kinetics. Thermodynamic factors determine the equilibrium 
morphology of final particles, whereas kinetic ones determine the 
ease of such thermodynamically favored morphology.  
In the aspects of thermodynamics, Torza and Mason13 first 
showed the interfacial behavior of systems including three 
immiscible liquids. They examined the required states for a liquid 
to engulf an initial droplet when both were immersed in a 
continuous phase. Their analysis showed that the interfacial 
tension was one of the main factors controlling the morphology of 
particles. Dimonie et al.14 also reported the viscosity of the 
polymerization locus, which related to the chain mobility 
influenced morphology as well. The following work from Chen et 
al.15 demonstrated an important mathematical model combining 
the study of Sundberg et al.16 to describe the free energy changes 
corresponding to PS/PMMA latex morphology. This model 
combining the analysis of interfacial tension predicted the latex 
morphology successfully.  
In addition, methods to measure interfacial tension between 
immiscible fluid phases have been developed for many years. For 
instance, Van der Waals acid–base approach,17 the soap titration,11 
drop-weight volume,18 and pendant drop19–21 could be used to 
determine interfacial tensions. Other methods have been reviewed 
in detail by Rusanov and Prokhorov.22 In our work, the pendant 
drop was used to measure the interfacial tension. This method has 
the following advantages: it is a simple-mathematical 
analysis; results are independent of the contact angle between the 
fluid interface and the apparatus; photographs of drop-shape can 
be analyzed instantaneously; it is a static method and therefore 
 27
nucleation of particles was negligible. Thus the size of initial 
droplet and final particle was unchanged through miniemulsion 
polymerization. Following was the description of Gibbs free 
energy change per unit area for five final states. 
 
State A: PU as the Core and PMMA as the Shell 
The Gibbs free energy change for state A was 
 
where γ12, γ2w, andγmw were the interfacial tensions between 
the phases of PU/PMMA, PMMA/water and monomers/water, 
respectively. R1, R2, and R0 were the radius of PU core, final 
particle, and initial droplet, respectively. To describe the free 
energy change per unit surface area of initial droplet, eq 2 could 
be rearranged as 
 
where ΔΨa was the free energy change per unit area of particle. 
To define the volume fraction of PMMA in the final particle, 
ψ2 as 
 
By Using R2=R0 (for ideal miniemulsion) and ψ2, eq 3 turned 
into 
 
 
State B: PMMA as the Core and PU as the Shell 
 
Similar analysis was applied to state B as follows: 
 
and 
 
 
State C: Individual Particles of PMMA and PU 
The volume fraction of PMMA was as 
 
Here R0=R1=R2, therefore 
 
The free energy change was expressed as 
 
and 
 
State D: PMMA as the Core, PU/PMMA as the Intermediate 
Layer, and PU as the Shell 
 
First, we defined the weight fraction of PU (x) and volume 
fraction of PMMA (ψ2). Thus the relation of R1, R2, and R3 was 
as 
 29
Synthesis of PMMA Latex 
Two kinds of initiators were used: BPO and KPS. In an oil phase, 
MMA (16.13 g), HD (4.4 wt %), and initiator (1 wt %) were 
stirred together. SDS (0.8 wt %) was dissolved in deionized water 
as a water phase. Then the oil and water phases were mixed and 
stirred. A miniemulsion was prepared by ultrasonifying the 
mixtures for 12 min. All the above steps were proceeded in an ice 
bath. The miniemulsion was introduced to a 250-mL round-bottom, 
fournecked separable flask with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, 
condenser, nitrogen inlet, and an outlet. After 5 min, KPS (if 
needed) was added into reactor. Synthesis of PMMA latex was 
carried out at 70 8C for 3 h. To obtain the dried PMMA latex, 
samples were washed with water, filtered, and dried by 
lyophilization. Two different PMMA were synthesized, namely, 
PMMA-BPO from BPO initiator and PMMA-KPS from KPS 
initiator. 
 
Synthesis of PU/PMMA Hybrid Latex 
In an oil phase, NCO-terminated prepolymer (5.59 g), MMA 
(15.37 g), HD (4.4 wt %), BD (0.125 g), SnDBL (0.1 wt %), 
TMP (0.125 g), and BPO (1 wt %) were stirred together. SDS 
(0.8 wt %) was dissolved in deionized water as a water phase. 
Then the oil and water phases were mixed and stirred. A 
miniemulsion was prepared by ultrasonifying the mixtures for 12 
min. All the above steps were proceeded in an ice bath to prevent 
the premature polymerization reaction. The miniemulsion was 
introduced to a 250-mL round-bottom, four-necked separable flask 
with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, condenser, nitrogen inlet, 
and an outlet. Synthesis of PU/PMMA polymer was carried out at 
70 8C for 3 h. 
 
Analysis 
Contact Angle Measurements 
PU and PMMA latex were poured into steel molds at 100℃ for 
24 h and their films were obtained. Two liquids, water and 
ethylene glycol, were used as the probe liquids. A releasing probe 
liquid (0.05 mL) was dropped onto the surface of polymer film 
from a syringe. Contact angles of each drop (θw and θEG) were 
recorded by the instrument, Olympus, model SZ-ST. Three drops 
were taken to give the value in average. As shown in Table 1, 
there were five kinds of polymer films. Furthermore, from the 
transform Harmonic-mean equation,23           
 
Surface tension components of water: 17.50 −= mNmPWγ , 
11.22 −= mNmdWγ  18.72 −= mNmWγ , Ethylene glycol 
(EG): 16.17 −= mNmPEGγ , 11.30 −= mNmdEGγ , 
17.47 −= mNmEGγ  were based on the ref. 23. Then the polar 
component γp and the dispersive component γd of the surface 
tension of each polymer could be calculated.

Interfacial Tension Measurements 
 
The interfacial tension measurements were done by the pendent 
drop method through Sinterface Tensiometer, PAT-2 with CCD 
camera. Interfacial tensions between monomer phase and 
water/SDS/KPS (if needed) (γmw), PU and water/SDS (γ1w), 
PMMA and water/SDS (γ2w) were measured at 70℃. For the 
measurement of γ mw, the monomer phase included PU  
prepolymer, MMA, IPDI, BD or BisA, and TMP. A drop of 
monomer phase from a syringe was immersed into the water 
phase and γmw was calculated instantaneously by computer 
based on the shape of drop. Twelve weight ratios of monomer 
 31
decreased. Hence, with increasing hydrophilic PU content, γmw 
decreased. 
 
Figure 2. Interfacial tensions between PU+IPDI+PPG and water 
with different PU polymer concentrations for BD/BPO/1.7 system. 
 
Besides, if excess IPDI was added (BD/1.7), it also resulted in a 
higher hydrophilic monomer phase and thus a lower γmw was 
obtained. To measure the interfacial tension of PU/water (γ1w), 
PU polymer phase with different concentrations was dissolved 
previously into its monomers. As increasing PU polymer (BD/1.7) 
concentration, Figure 2 indicated the value of γwould increase in 
the beginning. It was because that PU polymer, which was  
hydrophobic than monomers, reduced the hydrophilic ability of 
monomer phase. As more PU polymer was added, γ approached 
a constant value at 2.9 mN m-1 and the value was regarded as the 
interfacial tension of PU(BD/1.7)/water ( γ 1w). The same 
phenomenon was observed in the other PU polymer systems. 
Figure 3 revealed that the interfacial tension between PU polymer 
(BD/1.0) and water was 3.1 mN m-1, which was higher than the 
value of PU polymer (BD/1.7). It could be seen that the higher 
amount of NCO groups indeed led to a higher hydrophilic 
monomer phase. Figures 4 and 5 showed the interfacial tension 
between PU polymer (BD/1.0) and water phase was 2.9 mN m-1, 
as using BisA as the chain extender (BisA/1.0), γ was 2.9 mN 
m-1. 
Different initiators for MMA polymerization also influenced 
the interfacial tension. By using BPO as the initiator, as shown in  
Figure 6, the interfacial tension (c2w) between PMMA/MMA and 
water was 4.9 mN m-1. However, when KPS was used as the 
initiator, Figure 7 showed that γ2w reduced to 3.5 mN m-1. PMMA 
prepared from KPS initiator had much lower value of γ2w than 
PMMA synthesized by BPO initiator. It was ascribed to the ion 
charge of KPS that reducing the interfacial tension.  
According to the Harmonic-mean equation, the interfacial 
tension (γ12) of PU and PMMA was calculated by their contact 
angles. It could be seen thatγ12 was much lower than the other 
interfacial tensions.

Consideration of Four PU/PMMA Systems 
Based on interfacial tensions, the free energy changes of five final 
states with different PU/PMMA weight ratios could be calculated. 
The preferred morphology of PU/PMMA hybrid particle had a

BD/BPO systems with NCO/OH=1.0 and different volume

Z-average diameter, Φ31=Φ32= 0.5 for consideration.

for BD/KPS systems with NCO/OH= 1.0 and different volume

MMA. For case D, γ23=γ13=γ12/2, R2=10, R0= Z-average 
diameter, Φ31=Φ32= 0.5 for consideration. 
 
In Figure 11, when incorporating bisphenol A as the chain 
extender, the difference of free energy changes among five states 
became smaller. It meant that using hydrophobic chain extender 
for PU would cause a better mixing of PU and PMMA phases. 
Hence, unlike previous systems, the state E showed the lowest free 
energy change, where the homogeneous structure was preferred. 
By comparing the interfacial tensions of γ 1w and γ 2w, 
PMMA/water had a higher interfacial tension than PU/water with 
BD chain extender. According to earlier papers,9,10 
polymer/water with higher interfacial tension was formed 
preferentially at the core of hybrid particle. Hence, the PU with 
BD chain extender formed core-shell particles. While in the case 
of using BisA as chain extender of PU, the difference of γ1w and
γ2w became quite small, thus the homogeneous morphology of 
hybrid particles was possibly formed.  
According to above analyses, the influences of different 
NCO/OH ratios and initiators of MMA on the morphology of 
PU/PMMA hybrid particle were not obvious. Systems of 
BD/BPO/1.7, BD/BPO/1.0, and BD/KPS/1.0 showed PU-rich 
phase as the core and PMMA-rich as the shell. However, more 
hydrophobic chain extender in PU phase would affect largely the 
morphology of hybrid particles (BisA/KPS/1.0), and showed a 
homogeneous structure in hybrid particles. 
 
Comparison of TEM Observation and the Predicted 
Morphology from Thermodynamic Consideration  
 
BD/BPO/1.7 System 
According to TEM cross section observation, the particle of 
PU/PMMA= 30/70 had a core-shell structure and it was more 
obvious for PU/PMMA=40/60. From thermodynamic 
consideration, as shown in Figure 8, the preferred final state was 
also a core-shell structure. The initial monomer droplet before 
polymerization was considered as a homogeneous phase. When a 
larger amount of MMA was used, the rate of polymerization of 
MMA became faster. Although the thermodynamically preferred 
state was core-shell, the core-shell structure was not very 
obviously observed in PU/PMMA=30/70 because of the rapid 
polymerization of MMA and the morphology of hybrid particles 
was quickly frozen during polymerization. It meant that the kinetic 
effect limited the approaching of thermodynamic equilibrium. 
When a less amount of MMA was used, the rate of polymerization 
of MMA turned into slower. Hence, the particle had a more 
obvious core-shell structure due to the slower rate of 
polymerization as seen in PU/PMMA=40/60. 
 
BD/BPO/1.0 System 
From TEM observation, PU/PMMA = 30/70 had a core-shell 
structure and it was more obvious for PU/PMMA=40/60. The

and a base in the alcohol medium. In this study, 1.314g zinc 
acetate and 0.48g NaOH were dissolved in 330ml ethanol and 
refluxed at 60oC for 1h. The acetate group reacted with base, 
converting zinc acetate into zinc oxide. After reaction, the zinc 
oxide ethanol dispersion was mixed with DI-water for purification. 
ZnO particles were then separated from the dispersion supernatant 
by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 5 minutes repeatedly. Finally the 
ZnO particles were redispersed in DI-water to obtain ZnO water 
dispersion. TEM result indicated that the size of ZnO particles 
were about 10-30nm, as shown in Fig. 1.  
 
2.3 Pickering emulsion polymerization of ZnO/polystyrene 
composite particles 
For AIBN-system, styrene monomer and AIBN were first mixed 
with 10ml DI-water and then added to 50ml of ZnO water 
dispersion prepared as described in section 2.2. The mixture was 
then emulsified either by mechanical stirring (300rpm) or 
sonication with a Dr. Hielscher UP50H at 100% amplitude under 
0oC for 10 minutes. After emulsification, the minieulsion was 
heated to 75oC to start the polymerization of styrene under stirring 
(300rpm) and a nitrogen atmosphere. After 6hr of polymerization, 
the ZnO/polystyrene composite latex was diluted with methanol 
and separated from the dispersion supernatant by centrifugation at 
13000 rpm for 15 minutes repeatedly. As for KPS-system, KPS 
was added after the miniemulsion of ZnO and styrene was heated 
to 75oC. The ZnO/polystyrene composite particles were dried to 
powder in an oven for further characterization. The compositions 
of recipes to prepare different ZnO/polystyrene composite 
particles were listed in Table 1.  
 
2.4 Characterization  
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken to analyze the crystal 
structures of ZnO, using a MAC Science/MXP X’pert 
diffractometer with CuKα radiation at 40 KV and 30mA. 
ZnO/polystyrene composite particles were pressed into KBr pellet 
and the Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) was obtained 
with BIO-RAD FTS40 in the 400-4000 cm-1 range with 16 scans. 
The morphology of ZnO/polystyrene composite particles was 
observed with a Hitachi H-7100 transmission electron microscope 
(TEM).  
 
2.5 pH adjusting ability 
The pH adjusting ability of ZnO/polystyrene composite particles 
was investigated by dispersing ZnO/polystyrene composite 
particles into water solution with different pH value to form 1000 
ppm ZnO/polystyrene water dispersion. For example, 0.01g 
ps1ZnO(A) was added to 10ml of water solutions with pH=3, 5, 7, 
and 9 for 10 minutes. Then the pH values before and after 
ZnO/polystyrene dispersion were recorded and compared.  
 
3. Results and discussions 
 
3.1 XRD analysis of ZnO/polystyrene composite particles 
The XRD patterns of ZnO, ZnO/polystyrene composites and 
polystyrene were shown in Fig 2. Pure ZnO particles possess main 
peaks at 2θ=32o, 34.4o, 36.6o, corresponding to (100), (002), and 
(101) planes, respectively24. In this study, ZnO was synthesized 
from zinc acetate and base. The by-product sodium acetate could 
be dissolved in water and removed by centrifugation. Therefore 
sodium acetate was not observed on XRD pattern. The XRD 
patterns of ZnO/polystyrene composite particles of different 
compositions were almost the same as that of ZnO, indicating that 
the crystal structure of ZnO was not altered by the presence of 
polystyrene. In a Pickering emulsion polymerization, ZnO 
particles played a role as surfactant, which adsorbed on the 
surfaces of polystyrene/St particles to form a stable latex. As a 
result the XRD pattern of ZnO/polystyrene composite particles 
exhibited the same characteristics of ZnO. 
 
3.2 FT-IR analysis of ZnO/polystyrene composite particles 
Fig. 3 showed the FT-IR spectra of ZnO, polystyrene, and PS3ZnO 
composite particles. ZnO/polystyrene composite and polystyrene 
presented the same spectra in the wavenumber range of 700-3100 
cm-1 while the weak peak located at 500-700cm-1 is attributed to 
the stretching of Zn-O bond. Since the characteristic peaks of 
polystyrene and ZnO are both presented on PS3ZnO spectrum, it 
is clear that ZnO/polystyrene composite was successfully 
synthesized in this work.  
 
3.3 Morphology study of ZnO/polystyrene composite particles 
The ZnO/polystyrene composite particles in this study can be 
classified as polymerization initiated by AIBN and by KPS. 
 39
particles were observed. Besides, coagulation of particles resulted 
in ZnO-embedded morphology.  
 
3.4 pH adjusting ability investigation 
ZnO is an amphoteric substance that can react with either an acid 
or a base. In a acid medium, ZnO reacts with proton to form Zn2+ 
and H2O, while in a base medium, ZnO reacts with hydroxide 
group to form [Zn(OH)4]2-. This property makes ZnO a good 
material for pH adjusting. In this study, the variation of pH value 
of 1000 ppm of ZnO/polystyrene water dispersion with different 
pH was compared. As shown in Fig. 16, both ZnO/polystyrene 
composite particles initiated by AIBN and KPS adjusted water 
solution from pH=3, 5, 7, or 9 to pH=7~8. That is, 
ZnO/polystyrene composite particles as-prepared could adjust acid 
and base solution to neutral. They are potential to be good pH 
adjusting materials. To increase the range of pH adjusting and their 
application are under study.  
 
4. Conclusion 
By Pickering emulsion polymerization, ZnO/polystyrene 
composite particles were successfully synthesized. ZnO 
nanoparticles acted as surfactant in the polymerization of styrene. 
The crystal structure of ZnO in ZnO/polystyrene composite 
particles was not altered. Using different initiators in the 
polymerization, it resulted in different morphologies of 
ZnO/polystyrene composite particle. Due to the difference of 
degree of hydrophilicity, AIBN initiated system resulted in 
ZnO-shell and PS-core composite particles while KPS initiated 
system resulted in pure PS particles and composite particles with 
ZnO on the surface or ZnO embedded inside. ZnO/polystyrene 
composite particles showed good pH adjusting ability and they are 
potential as a pH buffering material.

Preparation of resin black matrix (RBM) and their properties study 
 
The object of this research was to investigate the effects of the composition 
on the UV curing and properties of the resin black matrix (RBM). Bisphenol A 
epoxy acrylate, Benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), Isophorone 
diisocyanate (IPDI), and 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) were used to 
synthesize acrylic resin. VP-DP 9850 was used as dispersant of carbon black. 
Irgacure 242 was a proper photoinitiator. PGMEA was used as a solvent. Carbon 
black was surface treated with dispersant and stable dispersion could be obtained 
by ball milling. High optical density (about 4/μm) and 25μm line width of the 
resin black matrix could be prepared. The thermal decomposition temperature of 
the resin black matrix is higher than 350°C. 
 
Synthesis of highly conductive self-doping poly(EDOT-co-TEBS) copolymer 
 
The synthesis of poly(EDOT-co-TEBS) by oxidative polymerization in 
methanol was studied. The sodium sulfonate functional group on TEBS was 
introduced to PEDOT, leading to a conducting polymer with self-doping structure, 
therefore reducing the surface resistance. The experimental results indicated that 
the surface resistance was low when TEBS/EDOT molar ratio was between 2/15 
to 3/15. Insufficient amount of TEBS caused poor doping effect while excess 
amount of TEBS would not completely dissolve in methanol for copolymerization. 
The content of initiator, Fe(OTs)3, changed the polymerization rate, thus 
influenced the surface resistance of as prepared poly(EDOT-co-TEBS). 
Insufficient amount of Fe(OTs)3 was difficult to initiate the reaction while excess 
amount of Fe(OTs)3 overdoped the product. The concentration of Imidazole then 
affected the reaction mechanism and the structure of copolymers. The solid 
content of reaction mixture and film forming condition also affected properties of 
films. Surface resistance was lowered by four-fold when solid content increased 
from 10% to 40%. Transparent films could be obtained when higher spin-coating 
speed and longer spin time were applied.
