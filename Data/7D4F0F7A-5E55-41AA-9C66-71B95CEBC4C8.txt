a two-parameter Weibull; in doing so, the complete data with outliers was obtained. Simulation 
results show that the LS method outperforms the MLE and maximum product of spacing (MPS) 
methods for small sample sizes ( ) in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). For large 
sample sizes ( ), the MLE method has a slight advantage over the LSE method in terms of the 
RMSE.

The Burr type III distribution also includes the entire region covered by the Burr XII 
distribution. Thus, the Burr type III distribution could be used as an alternative distribution for 
fitting data. Lindsay et al. (1996) compared the Burr type III distribution with the Weibull 
distribution for the diameter data from 20 permanent sample plots of pinus radiate. The results 
showed that the Burr type III distribution outperformed the Weibull distribution in its ability to 
summarize diameter data. Clark et al. (1999) used the maximum likelihood method to fit a sample 
of 1034 fault-trace lengths from the South Yorkshire coalfields. The results showed that the Burr 
type III distribution is capable of providing a satisfactory fit for the data. Shao (2000) investigated 
the constrained maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameters of the Burr type III 
distribution for toxicity data. He also provided the lower confidence limits of percentile estimates 
using the Delta method. Gove et al. (2008) reported that the Burr type III is suitable for fitting data 
from uneven-aged northern hardwood stands. Recently, Shao et al. (2008) provided an extended 
Burr type III distribution for low-flow frequency data; it was a heavy lower tail distribution. A 
simulation study was conducted to investigate the performance of parameter estimates using three 
different methods. The results showed that the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) method 
outperformed the other two methods (the method of moments and the probability-weighted 
moments). Under the reparameterization approach, we can see that the Burr type III distribution is a 
special case of the extended three-parameter Burr type III distribution. 
However, there is a possibility that the data collection contained outliers. The MLE method’s 
parameter estimation is very sensitive to outliers. The robust regression (RR) method has been 
successful in tracing outliers, and making sure that they do not affect the statistical inference. RR 
methods that can be used to trace outliers include the likes of: least absolute value, least trimmed 
squares, M-estimator, and GM-estimator. Huber (1964, 1973, and 1981) developed a series of 
estimations called M-estimations, which are based on a variety of objective functions. 
 
3. Methodology 
3.1 Estimation of parameters for Burr XII 
The cumulative density function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of a 
two-parameter Burr XII distribution are given by

2) RR method 
There are numerous RR methods such as: least absolute value (LAV), least trimmed squares 
(LTS), M-estimation, generalized M-estimation (GM-estimation), and minimum M-estimation 
(MM-estimation). Huber (1973, 1981) developed a group of estimations called M-estimations, 
which are based on a variety of objective functions. Based on the probability plotting procedure for 
both complete and multiply-censored data with outliers, we decided to use M-estimation with the 
Bisquare objective function as the RR estimating procedure for estimating the parameters of a 
two-parameter Burr XII distribution. 
In general, robust estimations minimize the sum of function ρ  to the residuals. The ρ  
function is a convex function called robust loss function. The Bisquare objective function is a robust 
loss function and is written as

. Here, σ  is a scaling 
constant which also needs to be estimated. The reader interested in the estimation of σ  may see 
Holland & Welsch, (1977). To minimize the sum of σ  function of residuals with censored data, 
the partial derivatives of ρ  must be set to zero.  This is given by:

corresponds to the Fre’chet distribution. And β → −∞ with /α β− tending to a constant 
corresponds to the reciprocal Pareto distribution. This distribution includes the log-logistic 
distribution as a special case with 1β = −  .The case that 0β >  is important in applications. For 
example we do not expert zero stream flow in water-rich areas. The extended three-parameter Burr 
type III distribution can approximate the generalized extreme value distribution in the upper tail. 
And the Burr III distribution is a special case of our extended three-parameter Burr type III 
distribution. Besides the extended three-parameter Burr type III distribution has some useful 
statistical properties. Explicit forms for percentile and moments are available. The scale parameter 
λ  offers the extended three-parameter Burr type III distribution further flexibility. Each parameter 
has a clear statistical meaning.λ  Is a scale parameter, α  is shape parameter and ,α β together 
determine the location. The density is unimodal at 1/mod( ) (( ) / ( 1))x αλ α β α= + + if 0α β+ > and 
0β ≤ . Finally the density is L-shaped if 0 1β≤ < .

distribution is given by

1) Maximum likelihood method 
Maximum likelihood estimation is the procedure of finding the value of parameters for a given 
statistic, which makes the known likelihood distribution or equivalently the log likelihood function 
a maximum. The log-likelihood function of the extended three-parameter Burr type III distribution 
can be obtained. To construct the confidence intervals of the three parameters ( , , ) Tλ β α θ= , the 
asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of ,λ α∧ ∧  and β∧  can be obtained by inverting the 
Fisher-information matrix. Thus, an approximate ( α−1 )% confidence interval on ,λ α and β  can 
be obtained from the asymptotic normality of the MLE method. 
2) RR method 
Nonlinear regression analysis is a technique used for the modeling and analysis of data consisting of 
values from dependent and independent variables. The three unknown parameters of 
 6
conditions: sample size n = 10, 15, 20, 25; parameter true values c = 1, 2, 5, 10 and k = 1, 2, 5, 10. 
Samples with one outlier and two outliers were implemented. For censored samples with small size 
and outliers, the simulation included the following conditions: sample size n = 30, 40, 50; parameter 
true values c = 1, 2, 5, 10 and k = 1, 2, 5, 10; censoring level CL = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8. However, when 
CL=0.4, the number of failure times proved to be less then the number of censored times; we only 
considered the sample size n = 40, 50. Both one outlier and two outliers were carried out. 
The simulation results for the data consisting of one and two outliers are presented in Tables 1-2. 
The following conclusions were observed: 
z The presence of outliers in the complete data led to either an under-estimation or 
over-estimation of the parameters for all the possible simulation combinations.  As the values 
of c and k are decreased, the estimated values using the M-estimator method are closer to the 
true value 
z The M-estimator provides lower levels of bias and RMSE for the parameter c than the LSE and 
MLE methods in nearly all combinations of simulation conditions. 
z The M-estimator has lower levels of bias and RMSE for the k parameter than the LSE and 
MLE methods in most simulation conditions, with the exception of the combination (k=1 and 
c=1), where the LSE has a lower bias and RMSE for the parameter k than the M-estimator and 
MLE methods. 
z The simulation results for both the one outlier and two outlier cases are very similar. 
The simulation results for the multiply-censored data with one outlier are presented in Tables 
3-5. The simulation results for the multiply-censored data with two outliers are presented in Tables 
6-8. The following conclusions can be observed: 
z The presence of outliers in the multiply-censored data led to either an under-estimation or 
over-estimation of the parameters for all simulation condition combinations. For the 
M-estimator method, the estimated values get closer to the true value as the values for c and k 
decrease. 
z In all the different simulation conditions combinations, the M-estimator has had a lower bias 
and RMSE for the parameter c than  the LSE and MLE methods  
z With the exception of the combination where c=1, 2,5,10 and k=1, the M-estimator usually has 
a smaller bias and RMSE of the parameter k than the LSE and MLE methods. 
z The simulation results for all censoring levels (CL=0.4, 0.6, 0.8) are relatively similar; the 
simulation results for both the one outlier and two outliers cases are also relatively similar. 
 
4.2. Burr III distribution 
The simulation study included the following conditions: sample size n=20, 50; true parameter

M-estimator method is a suitable option to estimate the parameters of the two-parameter Burr and 
the extended three-parameter Burr type III distributions for complete data or censored data with 
outliers.
