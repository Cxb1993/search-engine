toxicity of Taxol to the bone marrow is the determining 
factor on how much drug may be given. 
 
In this call-for project, we attempt to build a 
mathematical model that describes the effects of Taxol 
on cancer and normal tissue. The linear model is 
designed to take into account the proliferating cells, 
which are sensitive to the treatment, and the quiescent 
cells, which are resistant to the treatment. We are also 
considering a step function to describe the effects of 
the chemotherapeutic treatment, and would be able to 
answer the question: Is the total cancer mass at the 
end of one treatment period larger or smaller than it 
was at the beginning of the period? Besides, with the 
use of information from the medical literature, model 
parameters are estimated for breast cancer as well as 
for bone marrow.
