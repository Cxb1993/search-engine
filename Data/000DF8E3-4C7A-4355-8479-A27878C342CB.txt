摘要 
由於固定化菌體系統(ICS)可增加生化反應器之操作效率、穩定性同時使單
位生物質量處理容量增加並減少生物污泥之產生，因此利於非生長相關之生物處
理(例如:微生物脫色)。長久以來微生物固定化雖然被廣泛應用於工業界，但始終
無一簡單可行之量化評估方式供工業現場實際運用。先前研究[1]以染整廢水汙泥
中篩選出之 Pseudomonas luteola 固定化於永續性天然基材載體上，並以一新穎
可行之量化評估法來規範出最經濟可行之處理容量。本研究由此觀點延伸應用於
自行篩選之本土性染料脫色菌株 Aeromonas hydrophila NIU01[2,3]進行生物固定化
染料廢水處理之最佳生物刺激操作策略評估。由於 A. hydrophila NIU01 於批次懸
浮式系統中較 P. luteola 具有更良好之脫色活性，因此本研究試圖在不同基質濃
度(0.1-0.5X LB)下探討各基質濃度之最大處理極限濃度，並於不同進料流速
(30-60 ml hr-1)條件下於固定稀釋倍數基質濃度(0.5X LB)進料操作之最大處理極
限濃度，並於固定流速(60 ml hr-1)下以固定稀釋倍數之基質濃度(0.2X LB)進行不
同染料之最大處理極限濃度實驗，以推論 A. hydrophila 應用於固定化系統之較佳
流速、最佳基質濃度及於不同染料之最大處理極限次序是否與懸浮式系統[4]具相
平行之效果。

1 前言 
1.1 研究動機/目的 
 - 4 -
可能在不同官能基下破壞化學結構之相對難易程度差異，以及微生物作偶氮鍵結
攻擊之結構阻抑因子；並由懸浮、固定化系統兩者之差異推論固定化之脫色優劣
是否是受限於微生物固定化之質量傳送阻抑因素。因此本研究將分三部份進行：
（一）於不同進料流速條件下，試圖決定出在固定染料及稀釋倍數基質濃度進料
下之最大處理極限濃度；（二）於固定流速及相同染料下進行不同濃度基質之最
大處理極限濃度實驗；（三）於固定流速及定稀釋倍數之基質濃度下進行不同染
料之最大處理極限濃度實驗。再與先前懸浮式研究[4]所得之最大比脫色速率排序
相互比較，以生物固定化操作是否仍能維持其應有之脫色處理效能大小順序。 
 
1.2 文獻探討及回顧 
井鷹等(Idaka et al.) [6] 指出偶氮染料可在好氧狀態下被微生物分解，而於染
整業之下水道中篩選發現具有染料脫色能力之 A. hydrophila[7]，並發現不論在好
氧或厭氧條件下皆具有脫除染料特性，更發現脫色現象在好氧條件下較慢，但在
厭氧條件下脫色速率較快。文獻[7]中雖未直接指出 A. hydrophila 具有胞內偶氮還
原酵素來進行脫色，但間接化學分析證明染料之偶氮鍵結已遭受化學分解之事
實，更以 HPLC 及 TLC 證明 A. hydrophila 確實已將 p-Aminoazobenzene 分解成
Aniline 及 p-phenylenediamine，並推測其可能反應機構應如圖 1.1[7]所示。

而先前國內清華大學陳國誠教授之研究團隊[8]也曾在台灣苗栗之染整廢水
廠污泥中篩選出優勢脫色菌 A. hydrophila，並以各種不同類型之染料試驗 A. 
hydrophila 之脫色效果，發現 A. hydrophila 之所以可脫除多種類型之染料，可能
與先前研究之 Psedomonas luteola[9][10]之某些特性不同，A. hydrophila 除可脫除偶
氮(Azo)染料外，如蒽醌(Anthraquinone)、靛(Indigoid)之非偶氮染料亦具有較廣泛
之脫色能力，其中更發現 A. hydrophila 在 200 rpm 搖瓶培養條件下仍能具有脫色
能力(雖效果較靜置脫色為差)，最近研究[4]更發現不同類型偶氮染料之化學結構
將影響 A. hydrophila 電子攻擊及偶氮鍵之斷裂難易。總體而言，於低溶氧或靜置
條件下之脫色速率較快，於先好氧搖瓶後靜置培養之條件下，當菌體生長進入對
數生長末期時，可利用較高菌體濃度來有效縮短脫色所需時間，此點與過去研究

由於管柱中填入之載體為隨機堆積排列，可能造成管柱中流動為非理想狀

種不同流速之實驗值。 
首先將不含活菌之管柱(經無營養物補充條件下於密閉之 ICS 經 60 天以上
而形成不含活菌之狀態)，以去離子水於 60 ml hr-1 之流速流洗 24 hr (圖 2.1 (I))，
以確保管柱中菌床所殘餘之物質洗淨，待流洗完成後再以高濃度之染料(約 4000

圖 2.3 固定化循環進料示意圖，操作第一相位(Phase I)為染料適應期；操作第二相位(Phase II)
為正式階梯式進料期 
於 ICSs 固定化馴養期及操作程式(如圖 2.3 所示)，首先進料染料濃度之改
變將以 24 hr 為單位，每隔 24 hr 更換進料之染料濃度(即 100 mg L-1 day-1 變化
量)，並於染料適應期(Phase I)中採循環之方式改變進料染料濃度。注意於染料適
應期結束後，ICSs 分別以固定濃度基質(含 MgSO4 0.1 g L-1、甘油 10ml L-1 之
0.1-0.5X LB(依各實驗所需調整))進入正式階梯式進料(Phase II) 。本研究以階梯
式濃度逐次上升之策略(每天上升 100 mg L-1)進行，其中假設在此濃度緩慢上升
過程視為近似穩態操作(Quasi-Steady State)，而表現生物行為於近似適應操作下
所表現出穩定生物活性[1]。並於不同時間取出流水水樣監測分析菌體及染料濃
度。而為求最適化之固定化處理效率，本研究亦會同時探討於何種流速下可具有
最佳之處理效率，以及於各種基質濃度下所得之最大處理處理容量，並於固定流
速下，決定於不同染料及固定基質濃度之生物刺激下，各種不同染料脫色之最大
極限處理濃度為何？因此本研究分別以 30, 45, 60 ml hr-1 三種流速下以染料
(RR141)比較進行最佳化流速實驗，為求顯著之處理效果呈現，因此於以 0.5X LB
基質濃度下進行最佳化流速實驗，並分別以 0.1-0.5X LB 之基質濃度於固定染料
種類及流速之條件下推論各基質濃度之最大極限處理濃度，並比較在各種染料於
固定流速(60 ml hr-1)及基質濃度(0.2 XLB)刺激下，其最大極限處理濃度是否與懸
浮式系統具相平行之結果，以瞭解菌體於懸浮式及固定化系統中其脫色活性是否
有所差異，並試圖推測可能之反應機構及影響操作阻抑條件。

圖 2.5 固定化處理效果理論示意圖。Staircase input 表階梯式進料入料濃度操作線。Output response (I)
為無菌管柱出料濃度，與 Staircase input 平行，τd為延遲時間。Output response (II)為含菌管柱出料濃度，理論
上亦與 Staircase input 平行。P 點為管柱內染料濃度開始累積，M1、M2 分別為過渡期之平行線切點， 
本研究中之基本假設是「假設菌體於攝取能量基質以穩定生長及附著於載體，並誘導
產生容忍抵抗染料抑制毒性之能力並同時進行脫色」(如圖 2.5 所示)過程如下所示：  
(I) 為入料初期，所供給之養分足以支撐菌體完全附著及完全脫色，管柱內為一平衡狀
態。 
(II) 而在入料濃度漸增中期，所供給之養分仍可足夠維持菌體完全附著，但不足以達到
完全脫色，導致管柱內開始累積染料。 
(III) 為入料濃度增加末期，所供給之養分完全不足夠菌體附著及脫色，因此菌體遭受洗
出導致出料菌體濃度大增，而染料濃度亦由於脫色活性下降而急遽上升至與 Output 
response(I)相同。 
基於此，並依據微積分中之均值定理(Mean Value Theorem [1])推論決定存在與 Output 
Response (I)平行之切線作圖，可得假想平行四邊形而漸近出一簡單之鉛直線(a, b)計算在各
實驗條件下不同染料之最大極限處理濃度量(註：a, b 線段之存在乃是實驗中菌體吸脫附及
脫色活性動態結果)，假設由於入流染料濃度之建次上升，菌體無法即時完全處理染料而導

(數據已經校正停滯時間) 
原則上本研究基於一假設為當系統於穩定狀態，此時菌體之吸附(正反應)及脫附(逆反
應)應達到一動態平衡，因此綜觀三種流速之處理效果(圖 3.4)，可得一共通性結論，當進入
染料適應期(Phase I)時，初期(t<280)菌體較易流失，因此系統出料之菌體濃度上下劇烈震
盪，但於染料適應期末期(t>280)時可發現菌體流出濃度逐漸趨近穩定(各流速分別約為 30 
ml hr-1(1.24±0.46), 45 ml hr-1(0.90±0.53), 60 ml hr-1(1.08±0.45)，顯示系統可約略達到一動態平
衡(即吸附及脫附速率相等)。由低出口菌體濃度可確保大量脫色菌能可穩定固定於載體上以
維持高處理活性；反之，會因大量菌體流失而降低 ICS 脫色效能。 
圖 3.4 所示可知，於流率在 30 ml hr-1 之染料適應期初期，菌體可能受限於流率過緩，
造成能量基質濃度無法及時補充，導致菌體可能趨於老化而造成系統菌體濃度無法呈現穩
定而持續震盪，而於 t>280 時可知菌體逐漸適應該操作條件，因而系統出口菌體濃度趨於
穩定而下降，而在進入正式階梯式進料期時，可能因染料漸次上升而造成菌體無法即時反
應而造成基質提供已不足已反應染料遞增之處理環境，因而造成脫色逐漸失敗亦即因為能
量基質增加而造成(出口濃度上升)且出口菌體濃度持續大幅震盪，顯示系統中固定化菌體可
能由於逆反應(脫附)逐漸大於正反應(吸附)，而造成菌體逐漸流失而導致處理效果下降且較
不穩定，而最終導致整體系統操作失敗。藉由操作失敗過程中來定量評估固定床之最大處

總體而言，越易脫色之染料於固定化系統中脫色容量高且系統穩定，不易脫色之染料於

ment capacity and maximum allowable dye concentration in inlet
stream) of ICSs at various operation conditions. A novel attempt
(i.e., ‘‘concentration step-up gradient method” or CSGM; Chen,
2007) was used to show the plausible threshold criteria for azo
dye decolorization in ICSs (Shieh and Tsao, 2004). Application of
CSGM to an ICS could evidently disclose when an operation failure
(i.e., critical threshold) took place at decolorization demand
exceeding color removal capacity available for immobilized cells
in ICS. By applying a novel technique of a staircase ramp input in
concentration (i.e., CSGM) to the inlet stream of ICS, the maximum
treatable concentration and threshold capacity for decolorization
could be evaluated under different operation conditions (e.g., var-
ious ﬂow rate or azo dyes). Regarding staircase inputs, as only a
small increase in each step for concentration shift-up (e.g.,
100 mg L1 per day), almost complete cellular adaptation and met-
abolic adjustment to such environmental changes could be postu-
lated to guarantee the stable activity among metabolically
functioning cells in ICSs. In addition, the breakthrough curves of
column operation were used to determine apparent residence time
of ICSs. From a perspective in chemical structure, this study re-
vealed rankings of color removal performance of various dyes
using ICS for wastewater treatment. Moreover, the effect of ﬂow
rate of inlet stream was investigated under controlled operation
conditions (e.g., dye loading and nutrient supplementation) for
biostimulation of dye decolorization. Although previous study
(Hsueh et al., in press) compared reductive decolorization perfor-
mance of some model dyes in suspended cultures of A. hydrophila,
comparative assessment on color removal efﬁciency in ICS was not
disclosed. Thus, the rate-limiting factors (e.g., diffusive transport or
cellular reaction) to control decolorization in ICS still remained un-
solved for possible applications. To unravel these mysteries, this
study showed almost parallel rankings of color removal between
suspended batch cultures and ICS using various azo dyes. That is,
decolorization in ICSs was mainly controlled by intrinsic kinetics
rather than mass transfer resistance.
2. Methods
2.1. Microorganism and cultivation method
The decolorizerA. hydrophila NIU01 (Chen et al., 2008a, in press)
was predominantly isolated from a fountain spring near Chiao-Hsi
in Lanyang Plain of Northeast Taiwan. A. hydrophila was cultivated
aerobically at 30 C using Luria–Bertani (LB; Difco) broth. The LB
broth consisted of tryptone (10 g L1), yeast extract (Difco;
5 g L1) and NaCl (10 g L1). A loopful of A. hydrophila seed taken
from an isolated colony on a LB-streak plates was precultured in
50-mL LB broth for 12 h overnight at 30 C, pH 7.0, 125 rpm using
a water-bath shaker (SHINKWANG, SKW-12). Then 1% (v/v)
precultured broth was inoculated into fresh LB broth for 24 h
cell-immobilization. In all cultures, the pH was not controlled.
For biostimulation of various nutrient media, different percentages
of LB medium (initial NaCl all ﬁxed at 10 g L1) were provided (e.g.,
0.2  LB contained 20% LB medium).
2.2. Analytical methods
2.2.1. Measurement of dye and cell concentration
The model azo dyes-C.I. Reactive red 141 (RR141;
kmax = 544 nm), Reactive black 5 (RB5; kmax = 600 nm), Reactive
blue 171 (RB171; kmax = 609 nm), Reactive yellow 84 (RY84;
kmax = 411 nm), Reactive red 198 (RR198; kmax = 522 nm), Reactive
green 19 (RG19; kmax = 631 nm) were purchased from Everlight
Chemical Inc., Taiwan as described elsewhere (Chen et al., 2009).
Dye solution (e.g., 1000-fold stock) was ﬁrst sterilized through
ﬁltration (Millipore Millex-GS 0.22 lm ﬁlter unit) and then
appropriate dilution with growth media (e.g., 0.1  LB, 0.2  LB)
was carried out to have different concentrations of RR141 prior
to experiments. Concentrations of cell (kmax = 600 nm) and azo
dye were determined using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer (HIT-
ACHI spectrophotometer, model UV-2001). The concentration of
tested dye was primarily determined by measuring the optical
density (OD) of the supernatant of the sample after centrifugation
for 5 min at 700g (HSIANGTAI Centrifuge MCD-2000) with a sterile
cell-free medium as the control for calibration. As all samples con-
tained A. hydrophila and dye, concentrations of bacterial cells (i.e.,
(a) and (b)) and dye (i.e., (c)) were evaluated as follows:
(a) OD600nm of the sample mixtures (superscribed as X + dye)
prior to centrifugation:
ODXþdye600nm ¼ ODdye600nm þ ODX600nm,
(b) OD600nm of the sample supernatant (superscribed as sup)
after centrifugation:
ODsup600nm ¼ ODdye600nm and
(c) ODkmax of the sample supernatant (superscribed as sup) after
centrifugation:
ODsupkmax ¼ ODdyekmax .
Samples were diluted to an optical density less than 0.6 when
absorbance was not in the linear range (ca. 0.1–0.7). The relation-
ship between the biomass concentration and OD600nm is 1.0
OD600nm ﬃ 0.373 g L1 dry cell weight.
2.3. Cell-immobilization and dye decolorization
2.3.1. Efﬂuent concentration–time curves
Before color removal experiments were conducted, the mean
residence times of non-viable cell attached in ICSs from C curve
in RTD (residence time distribution) analysis (Fogler, 2006) were
determined via step-input with a constant volumetric ﬂow rate
as follows:
t ¼
R Cmax
0 tdCR Cmax
0 dC
¼ 1
Cmax
Z Cmax
0
tdC: ð1Þ
The forms of the step-input in inlet tracer concentration Cmax
were taken as follows:
(a) (shift-down) CinðtÞ ¼ Cmax t < 00 t  0

or
(b) (shift-up) CinðtÞ ¼ 0 t < 0Cmax t  0

.
The advantages of step-input are (1) it is easier to carry out
experimentally than the pulse test and (2) the total amount of
tracer in the feed over the period of test does not have to be
known as it does in pulse test (Fogler, 2006). ICSs immobilized
with non-viable cells were obtained through washing of sterile
deionized-and-distilled water with well-immobilized cells after
3–4 weeks starvation (i.e., nutrient supply was paused in static
incubation for 3–4 weeks). The concentration of tracer dye (i.e.,
RR141) in the feed to ICS was kept at the level Cmax (shift-up)
and 0 (shift-down). The apparent mean residence times tu
(shift-up), td (shift-down) could thus be determined through the
relations: shaded Area a = Area b and Area a0 = Area b0 (Fig. 1;
Fogler, 2006). Theoretical mean residence time (or space time)
at inlet condition is deﬁned as working volume (V) divided by
ﬂow rate (m) (i.e., t0u (shift-up) = t
0
d (shift-down) = V/m). The resi-
dence time distribution (RTD) of a tracer is characteristics of
the mixing that occurs in the chemical reactor. The shift-up
RTD is determined experimentally by injecting a dye tracer (i.e.,
RR141 herein) into ICS at time t = 0 and then measuring tracer

60 mL h1) were chosen to uncover how the ﬂow rate of inlet
stream affected biodecolorization capacity in ICSs. Moreover, to
clearly reveal the signiﬁcant responses of biotreatment using vari-
ous dyes, supplemented substrate concentration was set at
0.5  LB in these ﬂow rate tests.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. C curve analysis
Due to non-homogeneous distribution and porosity of packing
coral matrix to result in non-ideal plug ﬂow in ICS, the observed
behaviors of ICSs were very different from that expected from
ideal reactors (i.e., non-ideal reactor situations). Therefore, the
deviation of apparent mean residence times from theoretical
ones was anticipated. To obtain true maximal dye treatment
capacity in ICS to be determined afterwards, the evaluation of
this apparent mean residence time via measurement of the
RTD was conducted. As shown in Fig. 3, under different ﬂow
rates the C curves of tracer dye for concentration shift-up and
down in ICS attached with non-viable (or resting) cells indicated
that all of the apparent mean residence times were evidently lar-
ger than theoretical values (i.e., late exit of ﬂuid). These results at
least suggested that immobilized-bed reactor with channeling,
short-circuiting or bypassing was not likely to be taking place;
however, a stagnant or dead zone in which the dye tracer slowly
diffused in and out might cause this late exit of ﬂuid in C curves
(Fogler, 2006). This dead volume could be manifested by internal
circulation (or back-mixing) at the entrance to this upﬂow-type
ICS. Our ﬁndings also revealed that the longer delays in mean
residence time seemed to be depicted in the cases of smaller
ﬂow rates, suggesting that the internal circulation behaviors
might become more signiﬁcant (Fig. 3). In particular, this mode
of upﬂow ICS was technically feasible to non-growth associated
biotreatment (e.g., color removal) as longer residence time could
be achieved.
3.2. Decolorization efﬁciency of ICS
To determine whether the decolorization efﬁciency in ICSs is
controlled by intrinsic kinetics or diffusive transport effects, the ef-
fects of ﬂow rate on color removal performance in ICS were inves-
tigated. The color removal efﬁciency of ICSs strongly depends on
whether there existed a signiﬁcant amount of entrapped biomass
on the packing matrix (i.e., Porites corals) and sufﬁcient residence
time to allow cells to uptake substrates as energy requirements
for dye biodecolorization. As Fig. 2 indicated, the disturbances of
inlet dye concentration in Phase (I) were intentionally applied to
ensure immobilized cells stably entrapped onto packing materials
and gradually adapted to changes of dye loading. Signiﬁcant
amounts of suspended cells (e.g., OD600  1.24 ± 0.46, 0.90 ± 0.53,
1.08 ± 0.45 for ﬂow rates of 30, 45, 60 mL h1, respectively) were
eluted in the exit stream at the initial period of Phase (I) (e.g.,
<280 h). This suggested that both the adsorption of suspended cells
(i.e., forward reaction) and desorption of immobilized cells (i.e., re-
verse reaction) were still taking place (Tan et al., 2009). Then, the
state of a dynamic equilibrium between two sorption reactions
was achieved at late adaptation period of Phase (I) (ca. >280 h).
At lower ﬂow rates, more metabolically active cells could be stably
maintained onto packing matrix to result in higher treatment
capacity. In contrast, at higher ﬂow rates signiﬁcant loss of immo-
bilized cells lowered reductive power of biocatalyst for color
removal.
At ﬂow rate of 30 mL h1 (Fig. 2), since substrate supply at low-
er ﬂow rates could not provide sufﬁcient energy source for cell
propagation and attachment, unstable and oscillatory characteris-
tics of time courses of cell concentration was observed very likely
due to old-aged cells dominated in the population. As time went
by, cell population present in ICSs gradually adapted to changes
in environmental conditions and thus cell densities in the outlet
stream considerably decreased and stabilized (ca. t > 280 h). It
indicated that dynamic equilibria between suspended and immo-
bilized cells were reached. In Phase (II), staircase ramp inputs of
dye-bearing medium were applied to determine threshold
operation conditions. As seen in Figs. 2 and 4, signiﬁcant losses
of biodecolorization activity were gradually emerged when dye
concentrations exceeded critical loadings for treatment. The rea-
sons to cause such operation failures (i.e., inefﬁcient color removal)

tions in the exit stream. Therefore, for each chord AB there exists a
line (i.e., an imaginary chord or output response (I) RQ
$
; Fig. 4) se-
cant to the elution curve at points R and Q (Chen, 2007). As indi-
cated in Fig. 4, points R, P and A are approximately convergent to
be identical, thus arc PAB could be simply termed arc AB. Note that
once operation failure was inevitable, this degeneration would take
place extremely fast and spontaneously since total washout of bio-
mass apparently tended to be irreversible and decreased Gibbs
free-energy of ICS for the maximal stability. According to Mean Va-
lue Theorem (Larson et al., 2006), one might ﬁnd a point M1 or M2,
which is on the elution curve arc PQ, such that the slope of tangent
line (i.e., output response (II)) at pointM1 orM2 equals the slope of
line RQ
$
. Apparently, this tangent line at the point M1 or M2 is the
imaginary linear relationship of output response (II). With this
analysis, one may guarantee the existence of such a point M1 or
M2 and the unique line tangent to the elution curve at point M1
or M2. This implies that the threshold operation capacity (i.e.,
lengths a and b; Fig. 4) apparently exists and can be determined
via the prior proposed method of a constant-slope isocline family
according to Mean Value Theorem (Chen, 2007). Moreover, from
a geometric perspective line lengths a and b in Fig. 4 are the largest
decolorization capacity as all points in elution curves are located
above the output response (II) (i.e., <MATC) in Figs. 4 and 5. Owing
to this point, one might graphically ﬁnd MATC of ICS at the speci-
ﬁed operation condition.
Appendix B. Order of magnitude analysis on mass transfer
equation for ICS
According to mass transfer differential equation in vector for-
mulation (Chen et al., 2005):
@CA

one-dimensional mass transfer differential equation can be written
only in longitudinal direction with ﬁrst order kinetics (i.e., RA  kCA
as Ks CA in Monod kinetics). Note that ﬁrst order kinetics was pos-
tulated when only relatively small amounts of residual dye (e.g.,
<300–400 mg L1) were eluted in the efﬂuent of ICS at early period
of operation failure. One can thus obtain one-dimensional mass
transfer differential equation as follows:
@CA

If the ﬂow rate v was relatively small (e.g., 30 mL h1), conduc-
tive diffusion would be signiﬁcant (i.e., DAB @
2CA
@x2  m @CA@x ). In contrast,
convective diffusion would be important (i.e., DAB @
2CA
@x2 	 m @CA@x ) when
the ﬂow rate v was relatively large (e.g., 60 mL h1).

technique is the adsorption in porous materials (e.g., polyurethane
foam (PUF; Quezada et al., 2009) and clay beads (Bajaj et al., 2008).
Azo dye decolorization is initiated by azoreductase-catalyzed
reduction and could be susceptibly repressed in the presence of
oxygen (Chen, 2002, 2007; Chang et al., 2001). Apparently, the
ICS could create an anaerobic environment within the bioﬁlm
favorable for the oxygen-sensitive color removal. However, mass
transfer phenomena and reaction kinetics within catalyst pellets
and the heterogeneous bioﬁlm (e.g., internal and external diffusion
in immobilized pellets) were complicated in particular for dynamic
ICSs. Unfortunately, lack of appropriate assessment ﬁgures to de-
scribe ﬁxed-bed cell population simply makes performance of ICS
unpredictable and unreliable to on-site professionals for practical
applications. Chen (2007) selected a naturally packing material
(i.e., Porites corals; Porites lobata and Porites lutea; Shen et al.,
1996) for a model study of ICSs and suggested a method for graph-
ical reconstruction to quantitatively evaluate threshold operation
capacity of microbial decolorization in biostimulation for cultures
with different levels of nutrient media. This study used a system-
atic approach to determine what percentages of Luria-Bertani
(LB) medium (e.g., 0.1  LB, 0.2  LB) should be provided as the
most promising biostimulation for the cost-effective decoloriza-
tion. Thus, the criteria for threshold operation (e.g., maximal treat-
ment capacity and maximum allowable dye concentration in inlet
stream) of ICSs were revealed. Previous study (Chen, 2007) pro-
vided a ﬁrst attempt (i.e., ‘‘concentration step-up gradient method”
or CSGM) to determine the plausible threshold criteria of ICSs for
azo dye decolorization (Bhamidimarri, 1990; Shieh and Tsao,
2004). Application of CSGM to an ICS evidently disclosed when
an operation failure (i.e. critical threshold) took place due to decol-
orization demand exceeding color removal capacity available for
immobilized cells in ICS. This application experimentally showed
maximum allowable inlet concentrations (ca. 970–1182, 1304–
1503, 1560–1675 and 1635–1738 mg L1 for 0.1  LB, 0.2  LB,
0.3  LB and 0.5  LB, respectively) at various nutrient sources that
allowed for a technically feasible color reduction.
This demonstrative work based upon studies with a pure cul-
ture (i.e., Aeromonas hydrophila; Chen et al., 2008, 2009) and a stan-
dard medium (i.e., LB medium) is to secure a reproducibility of the
results and allow a clear accounting of all experimental observa-
tions for bacterial characteristics. This bench-scale column test
was to uncover a more promising quantitative scheme to evaluate
the maximal color removal capacity for practical waster treatment.
In addition, by applying our technique of a staircase ramp-input in
concentration (i.e., CSGM) to the inlet stream of ICS, the maximum
treatable concentration and threshold capacity for decolorization
was found to increase with the increased percentage of LB medium
for biostimulation. Note that the breakthrough curve theory (BCT)
(e.g., Yan or Thomas models; Pokhrel and Viraraghavan, 2008; Coo-
ney, 1999) that postulated non-instantaneous equilibrium in
adsorption columns was popularly used in literature to decide
how long an adsorption column can be used depending on the dye-
stuff loading rate. For instance, channeling (or short-circuited)
through packed column might take place to reﬂect high efﬂuent
concentration (Pokhrel and Viraraghavan, 2008). Regarding non-
biotic adsorption, Tan et al. (2009) mentioned that activated car-
bon column bed was found to be exhausted faster at higher pollu-
tant inlet concentration, leading to earlier breakthrough. However,
in this study cell adsorption and biodegrdation apparently inter-
acts with each other. Due to this different assumption behind the
BCT (e.g., variant amounts of immobilized cells), such a theory
might not be appropriate for applications to ICSs with gradual
losses of adsorbed cells as indicated herein (Fig. 1).
The advantages of using staircase input for system analysis are
straightforward. It is easy and simple to be manipulated for on-site
professionals in industry. As only a small increase in each step for
concentration shift-up (e.g., 100 mg L1 per day), relatively insig-
niﬁcant cellular adaptation and metabolic adjustment to such
environmental changes and the stability among metabolically
functioning cells in ICSs could be maintained. That is, quasi-steady
state behaviors of ICSs could still be anticipated from dynamic
characteristics via applications of this staircase input strategy.
Due to non-equilibrium dynamics between adsorbed and desorbed
A. hydrophila in ICSs, this method of graphical reconstruction upon
transient dynamics of ICSs (modiﬁed from Chen (2007)) presented
ﬂuctuated responses in exit stream for color removal. We also pos-
tulated the concept of ranges of critical biotreatment thresholds
(e.g., possible treatment capacity between minimal and maximal
values) to depict criteria for operation of ICSs.
2. Methods
2.1. Microorganism and cultivation method
The indigenous decolorizer Aeromonas hydrophila (Chen et al.,
2009) was predominantly isolated from a fountain spring near Chi-
ao-Hsi in Lanyang Plain of Northeast Taiwan. A. hydrophilawas cul-
tivated aerobically at 30 C with Luria-Bertani (LB; Difco) broth.
The LB broth consisted of tryptone (10 g L1), yeast extract (Difco;
5 g L1) and NaCl (10 g L1). A loopful of A. hydrophila seed taken
from an isolated colony on a LB-streak plate was precultured in
50-mL LB broth for 12 h overnight at 30 C, pH 7.0, 125 rpm using
a water-bath shaker (SHINKWANG, SKW-12). Then 1% (v/v) precul-
tured broth was inoculated into fresh LB broth for 24-h culture in
order to be used for cell immobilization. In all cultures, the pH was
not controlled. For biostimulation of various nutrient media, differ-
ent percentages of LB medium were provided (e.g., 0.2  LB con-
tained 20% LB medium).
2.2. Analytical methods
Measurement of dye and cell concentration: The model azo dyes –
C.I. Reactive Red 141 (RR141) or other dyes used for study were
purchased from Everlight Chemical, Inc., Taiwan (refer to Chen
(2006) for chemical structure). Dye solution (e.g., 1000-fold stock)
was ﬁrst sterilized through ﬁltration (Millipore Millex-GS
0.22 lm ﬁlter unit) and then appropriate dilution with growth
media (e.g., 0.1  LB, 0.2  LB) was carried out to have different
concentrations of RR141 prior to experiments. The concentrations
of cell (kmax = 600 nm) and dye (kmax = 544 nm) were determined
using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer (HITACHI spectrophotome-
ter, model UV-2001). The concentration of RR141 was primarily
determined from the supernatant of the sample after centrifuga-
tion for 5 min at 700g (HSIANGTAI Centrifuge MCD-2000). In addi-
tion, a sterile cell-free medium was chosen simultaneously as the
control for zero calibration. As all efﬂuent samples contained A.
hydrophila and RR141, concentrations of bacterial cells (i.e., (a)–
(b)) and RR141 (i.e., (c)) were evaluated as follows:
(a) OD600nm of the sample mixtures (superscribed as X + RR22)
prior to centrifugation: ODXþRR141600nm ¼ ODRR141600nm þ ODX600nm,
(b) OD600nm of the sample supernatant (superscribed as sup)
after centrifugation: ODsup600nm ¼ ODRR141600nm, and
(c) OD544nm (kmax = 544 nm) of the sample supernatant (super-
scribed as sup) after centrifugation:
ODsup544nm ¼ ODRR141544nm:
Within the linear range of absorbance (ca. 0.1–0.7), the relation-
ship between the biomass concentration and OD600nm is 1.0
OD600nm ﬃ 0.373 g L1 dry cell weight.
2976 B.-Y. Chen et al. / Bioresource Technology 100 (2009) 2975–2981
approximately one day. The packing matrix was thus ﬁlled in ran-
domly into column bioreactor (refer to column schematic in Chen
(2007)). To ensure complete sterilization prior to cell immobiliza-
tion, total recycle of 3% H2O2 (ca. 50 mL min1 in total volume
1.0 L) was conducted for one day.
Cell-immobilization step: After complete clean-up through total
recycle of H2O2(aq), 10 L sterile deionized-and-distilled water was
continuously pumped in 50 mL min1 into the ICS for total wash-
out of residual H2O2. In addition, the sterile conditions were fre-
quently conﬁrmed via traditional plate-count techniques. Prior to
experiments, precultured cells (ca. 600 mL) were then drawn into
the operation system for cell immobilization via total recycle at
ca. 60 mL min1. For column operation, temperatures were con-
trolled at 30.0 ± 1.0 C through designated coils heat-exchanged
from a water tank under on–off controller. Immobilization step
was continuously taking place for 2 weeks to ensure cells stably
ﬁxed onto the packing corals. During two-week immobilization,
approximately 300 mL cell broth was replaced by fresh, sterile LB
medium every 3 days.
Decolorization step: To investigate how essential substrate con-
centration affected the performance of color removal, 0.1 (10%),
0.20 (20%), 0.30 (30%) and 0.50 (50%) of LB media were used
(NaCl(aq) still kept at 10 g L1). Moreover, to provide better attach-
ment onto packed matrix for decolorization in the ICS, 0.10 g L1
MgSO4 and 10 mL L1 glycerol were also amended in the inlet
dye-bearing stream. During decolorization, constant ﬂow rate (ca.
1.0 ± 0.1 mL min1; dilution rate D = 0.079 h1) was applied to this
upﬂow-packed bed reactor. To exclude effects of non-biotic decol-
orization (i.e., adsorption), Phase (I) of operation in a designated
manner of staircase (Fig. 1) was applied prior to the Phase (II) for
practical decolorization. To inspect the maximal capacity for biode-
colorization during decolorization, staircase ramp input of dye con-
centration was applied as indicated in Fig. 1 (Phase (II)).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Decolorization efﬁciency of ICS
As Fig. 1 indicated, Phase (I) was applied to ensure immobilized
cells stably entrapped onto packing materials and well adapted to
environmental changes. Signiﬁcant amounts of cells (e.g.,
OD600  1.5 ± 0.9 approximately in oscillatory manners) were
eluted immediately into the exit stream at the initial period of time
(ca. < 150 h). It indicated that both the adsorption of suspended
cells (i.e., forward reaction) and desorption of immobilized cells
(i.e., reverse reaction) in non-equilibrium transient dynamics were
still taking place. Higher cell densities in the elution stream were
observed with richer media (e.g., 0.5  LB; Fig. 1). In the late stage
of Phase (I) (ca. 150–350 h), cell densities considerably decreased
and stabilized, indicating that dynamic equilibria of cell immobili-
zation were reached. In Phase (II), staircase ramp inputs of dyes
bearing with various nutrient media were applied. Apparently, a
poor nutrient-containing medium (e.g., 0.1  LB) could not sufﬁ-
ciently provide essential substrates for signiﬁcant cell propagation,
resulting in a low cell concentration in the outlet stream (e.g.,
0.5  LB > 0.3  LB > 0.2  LB > 0.1  LB; Fig. 3). As seen in Figs. 1
and 2, signiﬁcant losses of biodecolorization activity were gradu-
ally emerged when dye concentrations exceeded critical loadings
for treatment. When the inlet dye concentration was elevated,
decolorization efﬁciency gradually decreased as the energy
requirements to degrade RR141 in higher levels were also escalat-
ing rapidly. That is, the slow decolorization rate relative to the
escalating input loading rate led to a marked rise in residual dye
concentration over time. Due to stepwise increases in loading of in-
let toxic dyes, there was no sufﬁcient energy to simultaneously

4. Conclusion
This study provided a modiﬁed evaluation in a general perspec-
tive on threshold operation criteria of biostimulation for optimal
biodecolorization in immobilized-cell systems (ICSs) with A. hydro-
phila onto Porites corals as packing matrices. Our method of iso-
clines could clearly reveal the maximum allowable inlet
concentrations and treatment capacities of cost-effective biostimu-
lation for color removal of biodecolorizers.

Appendix A. Determination of threshold operation condition
in ICSs
To determine the threshold operation condition in ICSs, one
might apply this geometric interpretation of the Mean Value The-
orem (Larson et al., 2006; Chen, 2007) to the conceptual design of
‘‘graphical reconstruction” (Fig. 2) for system analysis. It was pos-
tulated that the elution curve of ICS was continuous and differen-
tiable with respect to time. The original model of conceptual
design was proposed as described elsewhere (Chen, 2007). How-
ever, due to data ﬂuctuation in operation of A. hydrophila bearing
ICS, such a model was inevitably modiﬁed as follows: When an
operation failure in ICS takes place due to inlet loadings apparently
over the treatment limits, the desorbed cells eluted from the pack-
ing matrix will be irreversibly washed out in a relatively short per-
iod of time. As shown in transition Region (II) (Fig. 2), perhaps due
to unbalanced competitive desorption and adsorption (i.e., data
ﬂuctuation) we could construct two arcs AB as the most probable
domain of residual dye concentrations in the exit stream. There-
fore, for each chord AB there exists a line (i.e., an imaginary chord
or output response (I) RQ
$
Fig. 2) secant to the elution curve at
points R and Q (Chen, 2007). As indicated in Figs. 1 and 2, points
R, P and A are approximately convergent to be identical, thus arc
PAB could be simply termed arc AB. Note that once operation fail-
ure was triggered, this degeneration would take place extremely
fast and spontaneously since total washout of biomass apparently
increased the entropy and decreased Gibbs free-energy of ICS for
the maximal stability. According to Mean Value Theorem (Larson
et al., 2006), one might ﬁnd a point M1 or M2, which is on the elu-
tion curve arc PQ, such that the slope of tangent line (i.e., output
response (II)) at point M1 or M2 equals the slope of line RQ
$
Appar-
ently, this tangent line at the pointM1 orM2 is the imaginary linear
relationship of output response (II). With this analysis, one may
guarantee the existence of such a point M1 or M2 and the unique
line tangent to the elution curve at point M1 or M2. This implies
that the threshold operation capacity (i.e., lengths a and b; Fig. 2)
apparently exists and can be determined via the prior proposed
method of a constant-slope isocline family according to Mean Va-
lue Theorem (Chen, 2007). Moreover, from a geometric perspective
line lengths a and b in Fig. 2 are the largest decolorization capacity
as all points in elution curves are located above the output re-
sponse (II) (i.e., <MATC) in Figs. 2 and 3. Owing to this point, one
might graphically ﬁnd MATC of ICS at the speciﬁed operation
condition.

This study attempted to combine chemostat pulse technique (CPT) and dose-mortality assessment in
pursuit of quantitative rankings of toxicity of model aromatic amines (MAAs) in the presence of diazo
dye reactive red 141 (or Evercion Red H-E7B; RR141) upon Aeromonas hydrophila. As known, bacterial
decolorizationperformanceof azodyes is directly dependent uponboth the characteristics of biochemical
reactivity and biotoxicity of dyes and related aromatic amines towards color removal. Thus, the ﬁndings
herein indicated that the relative toxicity series of MAAs were (1) ortho>para>MAA-free control >meta
position (for isomeric aminophenols); (2) –OH>–SO3H>MAA-free control (–NH2 at ortho position); (3)
–COOH>MAA-free control > –OH (–NH2 atmetaposition) through theCPT at 200mg/LMAAs. Comparison
on results in higher levels of MAAs at 1000mg/L almost showed parallel relative toxicity rankings at
200mg/L. Quantiﬁcation using traditional plate count method also conﬁrmed nearly similar trends for
corresponding MAAs except 3-aminophenol, revealing the promising feasibility of CPT for the toxicity
assessment in practical applications. In addition, dose-mortality analysis regularly used in toxicologywas
used to quantitatively determine toxicity rankings of MAAs. In conclusion, this study directly provided a
kinetic model to quantify the relative toxicity ranking of MAAs in the presence of RR141. It could provide
a feasible guideline for assessment on the toxicity or treatability of azo dyes and MAAs to A. hydrophila
in wastewater treatment.

1. Introduction
Since the ﬁrst synthetic dye,mauevin,was developed in 1856 for
practical uses, azo dyes have been the largest chemical class of dyes
frequently used for textile dyeing and paper printing. These indus-
trial efﬂuents often contain a signiﬁcant amount of residual dye due
to the inefﬁciency in dyeing processes. The reactive azo dyes reg-
ularly used for textile dyeing and paper printing are characterized
by the presence of the azo group, –N=N–, a chromophoric group,
that is, a color-producing group. As textile dyes are originally syn-
thesized to be recalcitrant to biodegradation, industrial efﬂuents
often contain residual dyes which inevitably affect water quality.
Usually 30–70% of reactive azo dyes are hydrolyzed and eliminated
into wastewater for dyeing processes [1–4]. In addition, inappro-
priate disposal of dyes in wastewater apparently causes a threat to
public health, as certain azodyes or theirmetabolites (e.g., aromatic
amines (AAs) or amino-azo compounds) are highly toxic andpoten-
tially carcinogenic [5]. Basically, cytotoxicity of typical azo dyes
may be relatively low, but the toxicity of related aromatic amine

intermediates are very likely still signiﬁcantly high due to their
carcinogenicity or mutagenicity [1]. For example, large “clusters”
of bladder cancer cases were reported among dyeworkers in 1890s
due to aromatic amines as the culprits [6]. Azo compounds can be
reduced to amines through cometablism and the aid of azoreduc-
tase [7,8] for decolorization. With conservation of wild-species in
local environment always a concern, indigenous rather than foreign
microbiota should be ﬁrst considered for in situ or ex situ biotreat-
ment. Due to this ecological concern for sustainable development,
Chenet al. [9,10]predominantly isolatedAeromonashydrophilawith
a promising capability for color removal to diazo dye reactive red
141 (ca. 10-fold color-removal efﬁciency to Pseudomonas luteola
[11]) from indigenous microbiota for environmental applications
(e.g., in situ bioremediation). As aromatic amines are difﬁcult to be
removed via traditional wastewater treatment and inevitably tend
to be persistent, the toxicity evaluation upon these amines will be
apparently crucial to operation success or failure in dye decoloriza-
tion and biodegradation afterwards. In comparison with P. luteola
[11], this study was thus intentionally designed to investigate toxic
impacts of aromatic amines to decolorizer A. hydrophila for optimal
operation as well as risk assessment.
As indicated previously, biotoxicity of dyes and their interme-
diary products to biodecolorizers directly determines the perfor-
mance of dye decolorization and biodegradation. For example,

LB broth (ca. 30L/L antifoam 204; Sigma) for aerobic continuous
culture (1 vvm, 200 rpm, 30 ◦C) at t=−48h. After 12h batch cul-
tivation (i.e., t=−48h), the fresh LB broth stream was pumped in
79mL/h (i.e., D≈0.060±0.002h−1) to the fermentor to maintain
nearly constantworking volumeat 1300mL for continuous cultures
(refer to Fig. 1 for experimental setup). Once the steady state (i.e.,
X0 = 0.664±0.067g L−1; data not shown) was achieved at 48h cul-
tivation (i.e., t=0), appropriate amounts of aromatic amine-bearing
dye solutions (i.e., tested cases) were injected into the fermentor to
reach the levels at ca. 200 or 1000mg/L AA using sterile syringe.
Moreover, the aromatic amine-free control (AFC) was simply the
case of injected RR141 alone in the absence of AA. In addition, diazo
RR141 was intentionally included in chemostat runs with the aro-
matic amines to reveal whether the combined toxicity of RR141
andMAA still could be disclosed by the proposed CPT. In these con-
tinuous cultures, the pH was not controlled to simulate on-site or
in situ practical situations. Note that the concentration of RR141
for all tested cases was set approximately at ca. 3800mgL−1 (or
3200–4000mgL−1).
For plate count methods, a loopful of A. hydrophila seed taken
from an isolated colony in LB-streak platewas precultured in 50mL
1/5X LB broth, Miller for 12h at 30 ◦C, pH 7.0, 200 rpm. Approxi-
mately 5% (v/v) cultured brothwas then inoculated to fresh 1/5X LB
medium and a cell culture was harvested in the mid-exponential
growth phase (ca. 4h) for further toxicity assessment. Then, the
1.0mL cell culture was serially diluted with 9.0mL sterile saline
solution (SSS;NaCl 10.0 g L−1) andonly thediluentwith appropriate
viable cell concentrations (ca. 1500–15,000 cells/mL) was selected
as the test seed (TS) for later uses.
2.2. Analytical methods
The model diazo dye (Fig. 2) used for study was C.I. Reac-
tive red 141 (RR 141; max =544nm), which is often used in
dyestuff plants and was obtained from Sumitomo Inc. (Tokyo,
Japan). The MAAs (Fig. 2) employed for toxicity assessment are
3-aminobenzoic acid (3ABA; 99+% Janssen CHIMICA), aniline-2
sulfonic acid (A2SA; 95%Aldrich), 2-aminophenol (2AP; 99%ACROS
ORGANICS), 3-aminophenol (3AP; 99% Aldrich), 4-aminophenol
(4AP; 97.5% ACROS ORGANICS). Prior to experiments, the dye and
amine solutions were sterilized by ﬁltration (Millipore Millex®-GS
0.22m ﬁlter unit), since RR141 and amines may be unstable in
moist-heat sterilization. With appropriate calibrations at speciﬁc
wavelengths, concentrations of biomass and dyeswere determined
using anUV-Visible spectrophotometer (HITACHI Spectrophotome-
ter, model UV-2001). The concentration of dye was primarily
determined by measuring the optical density (OD) of the super-
natant of the sample after centrifugation for 2min at 700× g
(HSIANGTAI CentrifugeMCD-2000). A sterile cell-freemediumwas
chosen as the control. As all samples contained biomass and dye,
concentrations of biomass (i.e., (1)–(2)) and dye (i.e., (3))were eval-
uated as follows:
(1) OD600nm of sample mixtures without centrifugation:
ODX+dye600nm = OD
dye
600nm + ODX600nm,
(2) OD600nm of sample supernatant (sup) after centrifugation:

(3) ODmax of sample supernatant after centrifugation: OD

.
Samples were diluted to an optical density of less than 0.6when
absorbance was not within the linear range (0.1–0.7). The rela-
tionship between the cell concentration and OD600nm (ODU) is 1.0
ODU∼=0.373g L−1 dry cell weight.
2.3. Biotoxicity assessment
Biotoxicity assessment was also speciﬁcally conducted through
a modiﬁcation of dose-response analysis [19,20] as follows: aro-
matic amine solutions were ﬁrst sterilized by ﬁltration (Millpore
Millex®-GS 0.22m ﬁlter unit) after complete dissolution. Note
that to clearly verify the stimulating or inhibitory characteristics of
the testedamine, only amine solutionwasappliedas the sole source
for plate-count assessment. The concentrations of tested samples
were deﬁnedhere as the concentrations of solutions and their serial
diluents which were well mixed with sterile saline solution (SSS;
NaCl(aq) 10.0 g L−1). The initial concentration C0 for toxicity tests of
all aromatic amine solutionswas chosen at ca. 3000mg/L (all below
the solubility products). Serial-half dilutions of initial concentra-
tion C0 (i.e., 1/2n C0; n∈N) were carried out by using 5.0mL derived
diluents mixed with 5.0mL SSS. The 9.0mL resulted serial diluents
(RSDs) were all placed in sterile test tubes for use in quantiﬁca-
tion of viable cells afterwards. The 1.0mL freshly harvested TS was
thenwellmixedwith RSD via vortex to form serial plate count dilu-
ents (SPCDs). Meanwhile, 1.0mL fresh TS mixed with 9.0mL pure
SSS was used as the amine-free control. It was postulated that AFC
denoted a toxicant-free blank and the viable cell numbers present
in AFC was thus the maximal number of viable cells in a non-toxic
environment. The numbers of survived A. hydrophila in SPCD or
the control were estimated by the standard plate count method
[25]. Standard plate count in 1/5X LB medium was carried out in
duplicate as follows: SPCD were serially diluted with SSS immedi-
ately after sampling, and then appropriate volumes (e.g., 0.10mL)
of serially diluted SPCD were spread onto agar Petri plates. It was
assumed that all cells in SPCD would be viable and culturable on

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effects of various amines
3.1.1. Low-level effect of isomeric amines
Time courses of growth characteristics (Figs. 3 and 4) indi-
cated that there were time delays (ca. 5–6h) to respond changes
in cell concentrations apparently longer than ca. 2–3h for P. lue-
tola [11]. It might suggest a slower response for toxic amine
than the response for nutrient substrate(s) in cultures. The time
course of growth characteristics in the culture without RR141 or
MAA (i.e., control w/o RR141 in Figs. 3 or 4) was stably main-
tained at X≈X0, indicating that the steady state was actually
achieved. There are three possible isomers of disubstituted ben-
zenes, 1,2-substitution (ortho or o-), 1,3-substitution (meta or m-)
and 1,4-substitution (para or p-). For 200mg/L of three isomeric
amines (i.e., 4AP(para), 3AP(meta) and 2AP(ortho)) in the presence
of ca. 3800mg/L RR141 (Fig. 3), the simulated kinetic parame-
ters k(=k− k0; refer to Appendix A for parameter estimation)
for 3AP, amine-free control (i.e., RR141 alone), 2AP and 4AP were
obtained to be −1.70×10−6, 0.0, 9.90×10−6 and 2.40×10−6 L/mg-
h, respectively. Note that the kinetic parameter k of RR141 alone
(i.e., amine-free control) was 1.10×10−6 L/mg-h, clearly indicating
that RR141 was slightly inhibitory to A. hydrophila and indirectly
explaining why A. hydrophila could play a role to be an azo decol-
orizer [9,10]. In addition, these results simply suggested that amino
group at meta-position of 3AP (k<0) might play a role of stimu-
lant to bacterial growth. In contrast, 2AP and 4AP were inhibitory

Control w/o RR141 denoted the control without dye or amines. Kinetic parameters
k were determined by the plots of ln(X/X0) versus time t (i.e., Eq. (A4)), where X and
X0 denoted cell concentrations at t= t and t= t0, respectively.

to bacterial growth. This clearly disclosed that the relative rank-
ing of biotoxicity of isomeric aminophenolswas 2AP>4AP> (RR141
alone) >3AP. This rankingwas slightly different from the ranking of
P. luteola [11] due todiversemetabolic capability of bacterial strains.
Although 3AP (Fig. 3) seemed to be slightly stimulating to cell
growth of A. hydrophila, all aminophenol isomers (2AP, 3AP, 4AP)
might be considered to be inhibitory (i.e., k<0). Ottoboni [28]
mentioned that with chronic exposure of toxicants, cells inevitably
require more energy to maintain the defense mechanism and thus
provide less positive change in free energy handling toxicant in a
manner to prevent a toxic effect fromoccurring. Due to this possible
inhibitory characteristic and extra energy cost to the growth of A.
hydrophila, color removal efﬁciencyofA. hydrophilamight gradually
decrease once similar functional group(s)-containing intermedi-
ates after decolorization were gradually accumulated. That is,
although A. hydrophila expressed an excellent decolorization per-
formance [9,10], the gradual decreases in azo dye decolorization
due to the formation of related intermediatesmight still take place.
Acclimation in intermediate-containing cultures would be needed
to improve and maintain color removal as indicated in Chen et al.
[9,10].
3.1.2. Low-level effect of functional group
As shown in Fig. 3 for comparison, in the presence of
RR141 at 3800mg/L the toxicity ranking of aniline-based dis-
ubstituted benzenes at 200mg/L could be determined by
simulated kinetic parameters for A2SA (k=3.40×10−6 L/mg-h)
<2AP(k=9.90×10−6 L/mg-h) and 3AP (k=−1.70×10−6 L/mg-

EC100: A2SA* (1250mg/L) >2AP* (3920mg/L) >4AP* (6170mg/L)
>2AP (3.92×104 mg/L) >3AP (6.97×106 mg/L) >4AP
(8.99×106 mg/L) >A2SA (1.46×1018 mgL−1) (3ABA);
Slope B: 2AP* (7.08) >4AP* (4.84) >A2SA* (4.10) >2AP (1.14) >1.0
>4AP (0.82) >3AP (0.45) >A2SA (0.28).
The largest value (1.14) of slope B for 2AP (Table 1) suggested the
smallest tolerance range from EC0 to EC100 and the steepest dose-
response curve for the toxicity of 2AP. In contrast, the smallest value
(0.28) of slope B for A2SA directly implies the widest range of toler-
ance to amine toxicity from the threshold dose (EC0) to amaximum
effect dose (EC100). Compared to P. luteola, A. hydrophila seemed
to express a higher tolerance (slope B≤1.0 and higher EC100 val-
ues; Fig. 6) to aromatic amines. This might cause a relatively higher
color removal efﬁciency (ca. 10-fold toP. luteola; [9,10]). The reasons
why the slopes of dose-response curves differ for different amines
involve the particular cellular and/or enzymic mechanisms and
metabolic functionswhich they affect [30]. In addition, for 2APwith
the steepest dose-response curve it is required to be treated with
caution as theremay be only a small difference between a dose pro-
ducing no effect and a dose producing serious outcome. Note that
extraploted EC50 values of certainMAAs (e.g., 3AP, 4AP, A2SA) went
far beyond their solubility limits (Table 1). This implied that these
MAAs should express insigniﬁcant toxicities to A. hydrophila. That
is, these MAAs could be very likely non-harmful to A. hydrophila.
In addition, almost all ECx values (e.g., EC50, EC100) were in simi-
lar ranking, indicating that biotoxicity based upon the viable cell
count is an appropriate indicator for quantitative comparison on
combined toxicity responses of amine solutions to A. hydrophila.
4. Conclusions
This assessment clearly indicated the toxicity series of model
aromatic amines to P. luteola in terms of kinetic models from a tox-
icological perspective. It clearly indicated inhibitory characteristics
of MAAs in RR141-bearing cultures, suggesting technical feasibility
of using CPT for toxicity assessment upon decolorizer A. hydrophila.
Almost all aromatic amineswere inhibitory to A. hydrophila (except
3AP), theoccurrenceof somebeneﬁcial effects still existed for expo-
sures of trace levels of 4AP, 3ABA (i.e., sufﬁcient challenge; Fig. 5).
As indicated in Table 3, the toxicity ﬁgure of 3AP determined by
CPT was apparently underestimated (i.e., stimulating). This excep-
tion of 3AP might be explained as follows: when cells were spread
onto 3AP-laden agar-plates for assay, each cell could be ﬁxed at
speciﬁc point on plates. However, cells in liquid cultures might
“swim” away to prevent such a toxic pressure for survival (i.e., tox-
icity reduction). Moreover, CPT results (i.e., this study and Chen
[11]; Table 2) indicated that A2SA and 3ABA expressed parallel toxic
characteristics to P. luteola and A. hydrophila. However, as different
isomeric aminophenols showed varied degrees to penetrate into

the plasma membrane of cells, diverse toxic/stimulating responses
on both decolorizers (Table 2 and [11]) were established. As shown
in the comparison between CPT and plate-count results (Table 3),
it was apparent to perceive almost parallel trends of CPT (quantita-
tive) and plate-count (qualitative) results (except 3AP). In addition,
Table 2 also revealed that 3APmight have synergistic interaction(s)
with diazo RR141 [28] in chemostat cultures, resulting in different
predicted parameter k values between the CPT and plate-count
method. Dose-mortality analysis also revealed that a negligible
toxicity of 3ABA to cells was observed at least up to 3000mg/L.
Regardless of diverse biochemical characteristics of decolorizers,
this study apparently revealed a promising feasibility of CPT as
well as dose-mortality assessment for toxicity assessment of MAAs
to A. hydrophila. However, similar to a possible human pathogen,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (that is popularly used for bioremedia-
tion of petroleum-contaminated soil and groundwater), Aeromonas
species is probably more appropriate to be cultivated in closed-
vessel bioreactor due to its likely pathogenicity.
