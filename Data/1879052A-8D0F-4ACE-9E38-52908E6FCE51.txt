Abstract 
 
In this study, the solubilites of indium-tin oxide (ITO) in a deep-eutectic solvent (mole ratio: 
choline chloride 1: malonic acid 2, Maline) with different water contents at 50oC were measured.  
It was found that the solubility of ITO in the Maline is enhanced with the addition of water up to 
35 wt%. When more water is added, the solubility is decreased. Such co-solvent and anti-solvent 
effects of water serve as the basis for development of an indium oxide recovery from ITO glass. 
Conductive glass with an ITO film was washed by an aqueous solution with 50 wt% Maline. It 
was found that ITO film was stripped and the resistance was reduced to approximately zero. By 
adding a large amount of water to the solution, the dissolved indium oxide can be recovered.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, the potential of ionic liquids as green solvents have been received much 
attention (Rogers and Seddon 2002). They have the advantages of being non-flammable, having 
low vapor pressure and wide liquid windows. Nevertheless, Jastorff et al. (2003, 2005) evaluated 
the eco-toxicological risk profiles of some conventional ionic liquids and suggested that while 
these ionic liquids have low volatility, their environmental friendliness in terms of toxicity 
remains uncertain. Recently, Abbott and coworkers developed a class of ionic liquids known as 
“deep eutectic solvent (DES)” (Abbott et al., 2001, 2003, 2004) by mixing a quaternary 
ammonium salt and a hydrogen bond donor, both of which with high melting points, to form an 
eutectic mixture with a substantially lower melting point. For example, the melting points of urea 
and choline chloride are 135oC and 305oC, but the freezing point of eutectic mixture made of 
these two components mixed by the mole ratio equal to 2:1 is 12oC. These DESs are easy to 
prepare and relatively cheap. Many of their constituents are present in organisms naturally and 
biodegradable; hence posting less environmental risk. They have been used to promote the 
chemical reaction (Abbott et al., 2002), the synthesis of porous zeolites (Cooper et al., 2004), and 
used as solvents for electrolytes in a dye-sensitive solar cell (Jhong et al. 2009). 
Moreover, Abbott et al. (2005a;b) found that the metal oxide dissolved in DES could be 
reclaimed from a mixed metal oxide matrix using electrodeposition and DES benefit stainless 
steel electropolishing. In addition, more solubility data published (Abbott et al. 2005; Abbott et 
al., 2006), especially the considerable solubility of zinc oxide in the DES which produced by 
malonic acid and choline chloride with mole ratio equal to be 1:1. It offered the opportunities for 
novel solvate-metallurigical process. Currently, our laboratory has discovered that the important 
characteristics of DESs is that both constituents are water soluble. If water is added, the solvent 
power of the DES will be reduced. Hence water can serve as an anti-solvent. 
Indium tin oxide is a mixture of indium(III) oxide (In2O3) and tin(IV) oxide. ITO is mainly 
used to make transparent conductive coatings of glass for liquid crystal displays (LCD). However, 
indium is very expensive and need to be recycled. Li et al (2005)  suggested the use of 6N 
hydrochloric acid as etching solution to strip ITO and use caustic soda to adjust pH to 13 to 
recover indium oxide. Use of such extreme acidic and alkaline conditions posted severe 
environmental concern. In this work, we proposed to DES to dissolve ITO from ITO glass and 
use water as an antisolvent to recover the indium oxide. In this work, the solubilities of 
indium-tin oxide in Maline (provided by ScioniX, the mole ratio: Choline Chloride : Malonic 
acid = 1 : 2) with different water contents are measured and preliminary results of ITO glass 
stripping and ITO glass were also reported.

The deep eutectic solvent, Maline is supplied by ScioniX. The reported purity is greater than 
98 %. Maline was dried at 70oC for 48 hours by the vacuum oven and stock in the dry box before 
used. The DI water produced by Millipore, model Milli-Q Plus was used. Indium-tin oxide (ITO)

To demonstrate the ability of aqueous Maline solution to strip ITO, commercial ITO film glass 
was immersed aqueous solution containing 50 wt% Maline for one day. SEM images of the glass 
were taken before and after washing, and the results are shown on 錯誤! 找不到參照來源。.
