三、研究計畫內容： 
 
（一） 前言 
The interconnection network have been an important research area for parallel and 
distributed computer systems. Designing an interconnection network is multi objected and 
complicated. For simplifying this task, we usually use a graph G=(V,E) to represent the 
network's topology where the vertex set V represent processors and edge set E represent 
links between processors. For the graph definition and notation we follow [3]. G=(V,E) 
is a graph if V is a finite set and E is a subset of {(a,b) | (a,b) is an unordered pair 
of V}. We say that V is the vertex set and E is the edge set. A path of length k joining 
u to v is a finite sequence of distinct vertices <v0, v1, v2, ..., vk>, where u = v0, v = vk, 
and (vi-1, vi)∈ E for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Two paths P=<u0, u1, ..., uk> and Q=<v0, v1, ...,vk> 
are disjoint, if for all vertices ui∈P and vj∈Q are distinct. We use d(u,v) to denote 
the distance between u and v, i.e., the length of the shortest path joining u and v. 
The connectivity is a critical magnitude of graphs. It’s also one of the most important 
fault-tolerant properties of graphs. For a graph G of connectivity n, the following three 
properties is equivalent. These definition is from Menger Theorem [8] (1)There exist n 
disjoint paths joining any two vertices of G, (2)there exist n disjoint paths joining any 
one vertex u to any set of n vertices of G, and (3)there exist n disjoint paths joining 
any set of n vertices to any set of n vertices of G. We can see these paths as one-to-one 
disjoint paths, one-to-many disjoint paths, and many-to-many disjoint paths. In this 
project, we extend these properties to spanning disjoint paths (SDP). A graph G of 
connectivity n is one-to-one spanning disjoint pathable if there exist n disjoint paths 
joining any two vertices of G and these paths span G. A graph G of connectivity n is 
one-to-many spanning disjoint pathable if there exist n disjoint paths joining any one 
vertex u to any set of n vertices of G and these paths span G. A graph G of connectivity 
n is many-to-many spanning disjoint pathable if there exist n disjoint paths joining any 
set of n vertices to any set of n vertices of G and these paths span G. In parallel computing, 
disjoint paths can be used as parallel paths for data routing among nodes. Also, each path 
in disjoint paths can be utilized in its own pipeline computation. 
It have some result of one-to-one spanning disjoint pathable in literal [2,7,9]. They 
define it as k*-container. One-to-many spanning disjoint pathable also have some results 
[10]. Recently, man-to-many spanning disjoint pathable was be published as many-to-many 
disjoint path coverable[11]. 
A path is a Hamiltonian path if it contains all vertices of G. A graph G is Hamiltonian 
connected if there exists a Hamiltonian path joining any two distinct vertices. A cycle 
is a path (except the first vertex is the same as the last vertex) containing at least 
three vertices. A cycle of G is a Hamiltonian cycle if it contains all vertices. A graph 
is Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian cycle. The concept of spanning disjoint pathable

1 Introduction
Interconnection networks play a major role in the performance of modern parallel computers.
There are a lot of mutually conflicting demands in designing the topology of computer
networks. It is almost impossible to design a network which is optimum in all perspectives.
Low latency and load balancing are two factors of all important issues. In order to get the
low latency and load balancing for data transfer, one method is to transfer data in multiple
disjoint paths. Obviously, if the paths have the same length, the transfer latency and load
balancing are optimal. In general, the existence of multiple disjoint paths or short path(s)
is beneficial to data transfer.
In this paper, a network is represented as a loopless undirected graph. For the graph
definitions and notations, we follow [1]. G = (V,E) is a graph if V is a finite set and E is a
subset of {(u, v) | (u, v) is an unordered pair of V }. We say that V is the vertex set and E is
the edge set. Two vertices u and v are adjacent if (u, v) ∈ E. A path is a sequence of adjacent
vertices, written as 〈v(0), v(1), v(2), . . . , v(m)〉, in which all the vertices v(0), v(1), . . . , v(m)
are distinct except possibly v(0) = v(m). We also write the path 〈v(0), P, v(m)〉, where
P = 〈v(0), v(1) . . . , v(m)〉. The length of a path P , l(P ), is the number of edges in P . We
also use (v(0), v(m))i to represent the path joining v(0) and v(m) with length i. Let u and
v be two vertices of G. The distance between u and v, denoted by dG(u, v), is the length of
the shortest path of G joining u and v. The diameter of G is the maximum distance between
any pair of vertices on G.
The path embedding problems have attracted much attention of research [8, 11]. One
of the most popular path embedding problem is Hamiltonian path problem. A path is a
Hamiltonian path if its vertices are distinct and span V . A graph G is Hamiltonian connected
if there exists a Hamiltonian path joining any two vertices of G. A graph G is k-fault
Hamiltonian connected if G−F remains Hamiltonian connected for every F ⊂ V (G)∪E(G)
with |F | ≤ k. Another path embedding problem deals with all the possible lengths of the
paths. A graph G is panconnected if each pair of distinct vertices u, v are joined by a path
of length l, dG(u, v) ≤ l ≤ |V (G)| − 1.

n ≥ 2, AQn can be recursively constructed by two copies of AQn−1, denoted by AQ
0
n and
AQ1n, and by adding 2
n edges between AQ0n and AQ

n as follows:
Let V (AQ0n) = {0un−2un−3 . . . u0 | ui ∈ {0, 1} for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2} and V (AQ
1
n) =
{1vn−2vn−3 . . . v0 | vi ∈ {0, 1} for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2}. A vertex u = 0un−2un−3 . . . u0 of AQ

n is
joined to a vertex v = 1vn−2vn−3 . . . v0 of AQ
1
n if and only if either
(i) ui = vi, for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2; in this case, (u,v) is called a hypercube edge and we set
v = uh, or
(ii) ui = v¯i, for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2; in this case, (u,v) is called a complement edge and we set
v = uc.
The augmented cubes AQ1, AQ2, and AQ3 are illustrated in Figure 1. It is proved in
[3] that AQn is a vertex transitive, (2n − 1)-regular, and (2n − 1)-connected graph with 2

vertices for any positive integer n.

Lemma 1 [3] The diameter of Augmented cube, AQn, is ⌈

⌉.
Lemma 2 [3] Suppose that two distinct vertices u and v are both in AQbn with b ∈ {0, 1}.
Then dAQn(u, v) = dAQbn(u, v).

Definition 3 Let G be a graph. G is called geodesic pancyclic if any distinct two vertices
on G are geodesic pancyclic on them.
Lemma 7 AQ3 is geodesic pancyclic
Proof: Since AQ3 is vertex-transitive. We assume the starting vertex is u = 000 and
consider the destination vertex v as the two cases: (1) v ∈ {001, 010, 011, 100, 111} with
dAQ3(u, v) = 1, and (2) v ∈ {101, 110} with dAQ3(u, v) = 2. By the symmetry of AQ3, there
is only one vertex is discussed for each case and related geodesic cycles of the two cases are
listed in Table 1. 2

Theorem 2 The n-dimensional Augmented Cube, AQn, is geodesic pancyclic for n ≥ 2.
Proof. We prove this theorem by induction on n. Since AQ2 is the complete graph K4,
the Theorem is true for n = 2. By Lemma 7, this Theorem holds for n = 3. Assume that
this Theorem is true for AQm with every 3 ≤ m < n. Then we consider AQn. Let u, v be
any two distinct vertices of AQn. By the relative position of u and v, we have the following
cases.
Case 1. u, v ∈ V (AQbn) with b ∈ {0, 1}. Without loss of generality, assume that
u, v ∈ V (AQ0n). By induction hypothesis, AQ
0
n is geodesic pancyclic. Hence, all the cycles
gC l(u, v;AQn) with max{2d(u, v), 3} ≤ l ≤ 2
n−1 exist. Then we divide the cases into
l = 2n−1 + 1 and 2n−1 + 2 ≤ l ≤ 2n.
Subcase 1.1 l = 2n−1 + 1. Hence, gC2
n−1
−1(u, v;AQ0n) = 〈u, Ps, v, Pc, u〉 exists. Let Ps
be the s-path and Pc be the c-path of gC
2n−1−1(u, v;AQ0n). Then, l(Ps) = dAQ0n(u, v) and
6
〈v′, w, P ′c, u〉. Since l(P
′
c) = l(Pc)−1, max{2dAQ0n(u, v
′), 3}−dAQ0n(u, v
′)−1 ≤ l(P ′c) ≤ 2
n−1−
dAQ0n(u, v
′)− 1. By the structure of Augmented Cube, one of {wh, wc} is an neighbor of v in
AQ1n. Let w
′ ∈ {wh, wc}, and (w′, v) is also an edge of AQ1n. By Lemma 6, there exist (w
′, v)i
paths in AQ1n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 2
n−1−1. Let C = 〈u, Ps, v
′, v, (v, w′)i, w
′, w, P ′c, u〉. Thus, l(C) =
dAQ0n(u, v
′)+1+ i+1+ l(P ′c). Since dAQn(u, v) = dAQ0n(u, v
′)+1 and max{2dAQ0n(u, v
′), 3}−
dAQn(u, v) ≤ l(P
′
c) ≤ 2
n−1−dAQn(u, v), dAQn(u, v)+1+1+max{2dAQ0n(u, v
′), 3}−dAQn(u, v) ≤
l(C) ≤ dAQn(u, v) + 2
n−1 − 1 + 1 + 2n−1 − dAQn(u, v). Hence, max{2dAQ0n(u, v
′), 3} + 2 ≤
2dAQn(u, v) + 1 ≤ l(C) ≤ 2
n. Hence, C is a form of the geodesic cycles gC l(u, v;AQn) for
all 2dAQn(u, v) + 1 ≤ l ≤ 2
n. This complete the proof. 2
4 Balanced pancyclicity of Augmented cubes
This section is devoted to illustrating the balanced pancyclic property of augmented cubes.
First, we introduce the definitions of balanced cycle and balanced pancyclic. Then, AQn for
n ≥ 2 is showed to be balanced pancyclic.
Definition 4 Let G be a graph. For two vertices u, v ∈ V (G), a cycle C is called balanced
cycle with u and v if dC(u, v) = max{dC(x, y)|x, y ∈ V (C)}. A balanced l-cycle with u and
v in G, denoted by bC l(u, v;G), is a cycle of length l, where dbCl(u,v;G)(u, v) = ⌊
l
2
⌋.
Let C = 〈u, bP0, v, bP1, u〉 be a balanced cycle of length l with vertices u and v, where
|bP0| ≤ |bP1|. If l is even, |bP0| = |bP1|; otherwise, |bP0| = |bP1| − 1. Herein, bP0 and bP1
are named as b0-path and b1-path of C, respectively.
Definition 5 Let G be a graph. For two vertices u, v ∈ V (G), they are called balanced
pancyclic on u and v if for every integer l satisfying max{2dG(u, v), 3} ≤ l ≤ |V (G)|, the
balanced cycle bC l(u, v;G) exists.
Definition 6 Let G be a graph. G is called balanced pancyclic if any distinct two vertices
on G are balanced pancyclic on them.
Lemma 8 AQ3 and AQ4 are both balanced pancyclic.
8
Subcase 1.1: 2n−1 + 1 ≤ l ≤ 2n − 1. By Lemma 1, dAQ0n(u, v) ≤ ⌈
n−1
2
⌉. Hence,
dAQ0n(u, v) < 2
n−2 for n ≥ 3. Since AQ0n is panconnected, there exist (u, v)i paths for
2n−2 ≤ i ≤ 2n−1 − 1. Also there exist (uh, vh)j paths for 2
n−2 − 1 ≤ j ≤ 2n−1 − 2. Let
C = 〈u, (u, v)i, v, v
h, (uh, vh)j, u
h, u〉. Hence, 2n−2 + 1 + 2n−2 − 1 + 1 = 2n−1 + 1 ≤ l(C) ≤
2n−1 − 1 + 1 + 2n−1 − 2 + 1 = 2n − 1. Suppose we choose l((uh, vh)j) = l((u, v)i) − 2 or
l((u, v)i)) − 1, Hence, the cycle C is the form of the balanced cycles bC
l(u, v;AQn) for all
2n−1 + 1 ≤ l ≤ 2n − 1. See Figure 2 (a) for illustration.
Subcase 1.2: l = 2n. Since there are 2n − 3 neighbors of v in AQ0n, we can choose an
neighbor x of v in AQ0n such that y ∈ {x
h, xc} and w ∈ {yh, yc} with w 6∈ {u, x, v}. Since
AQn−1 is k-fault Hamiltonian connected with k = 2n − 6 ≥ 2 when n ≥ 4, there exists a
hamiltonian path (u,w)h of AQ
0
i − {x, v} with i = 2
n−1 − 3, and there exists a hamiltonian
path (uh, vh)j of AQ
1
n − {y} with j = 2
n−1 − 2. Then, we can construct a cycle D =
〈u, (u,w)2n−1−3, w, y, x, v, v
h, (uh, vh)2n−1−2, u
h, u〉. Since the path 〈u, (u,w)2n−1−3, w, y, x, v〉
has length 2n−1 − 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 2n−1 and the path 〈v, vh, (uh, vh)2n−1−2, u
h, u〉 has length
1+2n−1−2+1 = 2n−1, D is a balanced cycle bC2

(u, v;AQn). See Figure 2 (b) for illustration.

Lemma 4, the paths 〈u, v′, v〉 and 〈v, u′, u〉 exist where v′ ∈ {vh, vc} and u′ ∈ {uh, uc}.
Thus, 〈u, v, v′, u〉 is a balanced cycle bC3(u, v;AQn) and 〈u, u
′, v, v′, u〉 is a balanced cycle
bC4(u, v;AQn). By Lemma 6, there exist the paths (v
