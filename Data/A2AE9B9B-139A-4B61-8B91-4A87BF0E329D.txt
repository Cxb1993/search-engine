The major objective of this paper is to illustrate 
a real-time traffic simulation system with real-time 
traffic input, by macroscopic traffic model on a real 
urban network. Some results on the topic of real-time 
traffic simulation were presented by Chronopoulos 
and Johnston [1]. They’ve shown that the real-time 
traffic simulation process is feasible on a freeway. 
The main difference between this paper and that of 
Chronopoulos and Johnston is: This model 
implements the real-time traffic simulation process 
on an urban network. That means the assignment of 
real-time origin-destination (O-D) matrix and path 
flow must be considered, which in many other 
simulations are either done off-line or be assigned as 
an input [11].   
The content of the article will be followed by 1) 
the framework and the elements of the real-time 
traffic simulation is discussed, 2) the system 
implementation, and 3) the conclusions. 
 
 
2 The Framework of Real-Time Traffic 
Simulation 
In this section, overall framework of the real-time 
simulation is described. Then the main elements, path 
generation, dynamic origin-destination estimation, 
and link dynamics, are presented. The simulation 
begins with loading network structure, and then the 
path generation will generate possible path set for 
dynamic origin-destination estimation. By using the 
possible path set and real-time traffic data from the 
surveillance system, dynamic origin-destination 
estimation will estimate the path flow. With the 
network structure information, path flow can be 
transformed into link flow, and then send to the 
procedure of link dynamics. In the procedure of link 
dynamics, the link flow and the signal timing phase 
information is been transformed into boundaries 
condition of macroscopic traffic model. After solving 
the traffic model, travel time information is then 
generated as the system output. The framework of 
this simulation is shown as figure 1. 
 
2.1 Path Generation 
In this simulation, a path generation is introduced to 
generate possible path set for the given origin and 
destination vertex of the simulation network. This 
study generates possible path by solving Wardrop’s 
user equilibrium principle.

The most classical formulation for solving user 
equilibrium is Beckmann’s transformation [18]. The

of user equilibrium is

A convex combination algorithm is applied to 
the user equilibrium objective function to solve the 
problem [19]. In this simulation the algorithm is 
modified to generate the path set. When applied to 
the solution of the user equilibrium problem, the 
solution algorithm A can be summarized as follows,

2.3 Link Dynamics 
The model of link dynamics in the simulation is 
described in this section. It’ll follow by the 
macroscopic traffic models and the consideration of 
signal effect to the link. 
 
2.3.1   Macroscopic traffic continuum models 
Macroscopic traffic continuum models had been 
classified into first-order continuum models, such as 
Lighthill, Whitham and Richards’ well-known flow 
conservation model (LWR model), and high-order 
continuum models, such as Payne’s momentum 
conservation models (PW model) [16]. The models 
are composed of one or several partial differential 
equations (PDEs) defined on appropriate domains 
with initial and boundary conditions.  
The model been used in the simulation is the 
LWR model, the classical scalar conservation law 
developed by Lighthill and Whitham and Richard. 
The LWR model consists of the fundamental 
conservation principle in the form of a PDE,

It is assumed that the empirical u-k relationships 
follow the Greenshields traffic stream model

ku k u k= × −  (6) 
where uf denote the free flow speed and kb the density 
with vehicles bumper to bumper. Since it is difficult 
to find the analytical solution of the traffic continuum 
model, numerical methods, such as Lax or Upwind 
method, had been used by researchers to simulate the 
numerical solutions for traffic continuum models [8]. 
Lax-F finite difference method is used in solution 
scheme. For convenience, we use the following 
notations: 
 
x∆ : uniform step size of space grids 
t∆ : uniform width of time mesh 
nt∆ : adaptive width of time mesh at time 0

Lax-F scheme transfer PDEs to finite difference 
equations by using centered difference skill. The 
Lax-F difference equation of LWR continuum model 
can be written as

General finite difference methods usually 
require the uniform space mesh and the uniform time 
mesh. In order to satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs- 
Lewy (CFL) condition, explicit finite difference 
methods would generate many tiny time step sizes in 
simulating traffic continuum model. In order to 
improve the computation performance, Cho designed 
a finite difference scheme with adjustable time mesh 
to solve the hyperbolic traffic flow model.  The next 
time size can be determined by calculating the ratio 
of uniform space mesh size and maximal slop of 
characteristic curve at current stage, can be expressed 
as
