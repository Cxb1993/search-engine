2、Introduction  
Flash memory (Flash memory) of the 
invention on behalf of the origin in the 
year 1960. At that time, the electronic 
information stored on magnetic core 
memory (magnetic-core memory)-based, 
nuclear magnetic memory as a result of 
the high cost of large volume and high 
power, in order to replace nuclear 
magnetic memory, I and Dr. Kahng 
co-invented the first stop floating 
(floating-gate) non-volatile memory at 
Bell Labs in 1967.  
Today, flash memory (Flash memory) 
has a non-volatile memory structure of 
the main flow, its extensive use in 
personal computers, as well as two 
aspects of embedded memory. In recent 
years, with consumer electronics 
products pandemic and portable 
electronic products can quickly 
universal in all families, one of the most 
important factor is the use of convenient 
flash memory high-provincial electricity, 
high-density and lightweight 
characteristics of earthquake. Traditional 
non-volatile memory for the main 
structure of floating gate polysilicon 
(poly-Si float gate), as shown in Figure 
1. 
Plus the gate bias, the carrier of silicon 
plate can be gained large enough kinetic 
energy to tunnel tunneling oxide by FN 
and storage in the poly-crystal floating 
gate (floating gate). Removing the 
power supply in addition, the carrier in 
the floating gate don’t have enough 
kinetic energy to tunnel to substrate and 
cause limited sub-set of the floating gate, 
and then have a flat-band voltage of the 
translation, so that threshold voltage 
changes. There are different bits of the 
power flow for the detection of 
quasi-circuit judge to the effect of 
memory.  
With non-volatile memory in the large 
capacity, high-speed and low energy loss 
of the request, the floating gate memory 
and between the silica substrate 
(Tunneling oxide layer) need to 
microfilm down. However, scaling down 
the tunneling oxide layer made floating 
gate non-volatile memory components 
to face the inevitable clinical challenge. 
That is, in a number of components after 
the operation, making leaks easily track 
circuit was produced in the tunneling 
oxide layer, once formed by the leakage 
of electrical path connected floating gate 
and substrate, stored in the floating gate 
of the carrier will then be through this 
path and all is lost, lead to the loss of 
memory effect. In recent years, 
nanocrystals have been applied to 
non-volatile memory (Figure 2), to solve 
the traditional poly-crystal silicon 
floating gate memory (eg, flash memory) 
scaling down problem. Different from 
 
 
 torr at power of 50 W. To measure the 
electric characteristics, a 500-nm-thick 
Al was thermally evaporated through a 
shadow mask on the control oxide to 
form the metal-oxidesemiconductor  
(MOS) structure. The x-ray 
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was 
adopted to analyze the chemical bonding 
and composition of the charge storage 
layer. Electrical characteristics were 
measured using Keithley4200 and 
HP4284 Precision LCR meter.

FIG. 3. (Color online) (a) Si 2p, (b) Mo 3p, and N 1s 
core-level spectra of the charge storage layer 
composed of Mo nanocrystals embedded in SiOx with 
and without the plasma treatment.  
Figure 3 shows the XPS spectra of the 
charge storage layer with and without 
the plasma treatment, which was 
performed  
by using a monochromatic Al Kα(1486.6 
eV) x-ray. Figure 3(a) shows the XPS Si 
2p spectra of the charge storage for the 
sample with and without the plasma 
treatment. 
For the sample without the treatment in 
Fig. 3(a), the peak position of XPS Si 2p 
situated at 102.9 eV indicates that the 
surrounding oxide of nanocrystals is 
SiOx.[1] There is no obvious difference 
in the peak positions between the 
samples with and without the treatment. 
However, it was found that an additional 
XPS peak (397.8 eV) appears in the Mo 
3p and N 1s spectra of the charge 
storage layer after the plasma treatment, 
which indicates that the incomplete 
bonds in SiOx bonded with nitrogen after 
the plasma treatment, as shown in Fig. 
3(b).[2] 
 
FIG. 4. (Color online) C-V curves of the MOS 
structure with and without the plasma treatment. The 
inset of the is the simple band diagram of the structure 
in the flat-band state. 
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the C-V 
curves of MOS structure embedded with 
Mo nanocrystals for the sample with and 
without the plasma treatment, 
respectively. At the smaller sweeping 
voltage of 2 V, there is a negligible 
memory window in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) 
corresponding to the quasineutral state 
(i.e., no charge is stored in the charge 
 
 programming and erase states) reduced 
significantly, and the △VFB remained 
51% after 106 program/erase cycles. 
However, the plasma treated sample 
exhibits robust endurance characteristic 
(△VFB of 89% after 106 program/erase 
cycles). It is known that the △ VFB 
reduction during the endurance test is 
due to the degradation of the gate 
oxide.[5]  
(3.2 NiSi2/SiNX nanocrystals for 
nonvolatile memory devices) 
3-2-1 (Experiment) 
5 
The better endurance characteristics of 
the sample with the plasma treatment 
can be attributed to the improvement of 
quality of the surrounding oxide. During 
the endurance test, the carriers transport 
between nanocrystals and the substrate 
can damage the surrounding oxide, 
which produces more traps. Because the 
surrounding oxide was strengthened by 
the nitrogen incorporation after the 
treatment, the generation rate of traps 
reduced, resulting in the better 
endurance characteristic.  
3-1-3 (Conclusion) 
The nonvolatile memory characteristics 
of the Mo nanocrystals were influenced 
by the ammonia plasma treatment. The 
C-V hysteresis reduced to 3.0 V and 
retention characteristic improved with 
decay rate of -66 mV/decade after the 
plasma treatment due to the nitrogen 
passivation of the traps in the oxide 
around the nanocrystals. The 
incorporation of nitrogen into the charge 
storage layer through the NH3 plasma 
treatment can strengthen the endurance 
characteristic of Mo nanocrystals 
memory.  
This memory-cell structure was 
fabricated on a 6 inch p-type silicon 
(100) wafer. After a standard RCA 
process which removed native oxide and 
micro-particles, a 4.5-nm-thick tunnel 
oxide (SiO2) was thermally grown by a 
dry oxidation process in an atmospheric 
pressure chemical vapor deposition 
furnace. Subsequently, three type 
structure of NiSi2 charge-storage layer 
was fabricated to compare. About 5~7 
nm thick NiSi2 layer was deposited for 
single-layer (sample A) and 
double-layer (sample B) nanocrystal 
storage structure with only Ar 50 sccm. 
The sample A was also used to be 
control sample and the two nanocrystal 
storage layer of sample B was separated 
by about 3 nm PVD oxide (SiO2). The 
other structure is also about 5 nm thick 
nanocrystal storage layer sputtering in 
the mixture gas of Ar (50sccm) and NH3 
(10 sccm) at room temperature to induce 
the nitride based trap (sample C). After 
that, about 30nm SiO2 was deposited as 
control oxide. Nanocrystals can be 
isolated well and the oxide quality can 
be improved by rapid thermal anneal in 
O2 ambiance. Finally, the bottom and 
top Al electrode was patterned to form 
the MOS transistors. 
3-2-2 (Discussions) 
To confirm the formation of nanocrystal, 
the cross-sectional transmission electron 
microscope images of the single-layer 
 
 band with pulse time for samples A and 
B. Comparing with sample A, sample B 
still has an equal memory window even 
it is operated with a smaller effective 
electric field.

Fig. 3 Electron and hole injection induced threshold 
voltage shift (△VT) from flat band with pulse time for 
devices with (a) single-layer and (b) double-layer 
nanocrystal structures. 
Figure 4(a) and Figure 4(b) show the 
retention characteristics of the samples 
A and B, respectively. It can be seen that 
the decay ratio of sample B is large than 
that of sample A. Because the coulomb 
blockade effect induced by the electrons 
stored in the first layer (the closer layer 
from Si substrate) can exclude the 
electrons stored in the second layer (the 
further layer from Si substrate) from 
leaking back to the substrate, the stored 
carrier can be improved from 49.9% 
(sample A) to 58.7% (sample B) until 
104 sec in room temperature.  
 
Fig. 4 Retention characteristics of (a) single-layer and 
(b) double-layer nanocrystal structure at room 
temperature. The device with double-layer structure 
has better retention characteristic, 58.7%, at 104 sec 
than that for single-layer device because of coulomb 
blockade effect. 
In order to combine the advantages of 
nonvolatile nanocrystal memory (NVM) 
and metal/oxide/nitride/oxide/silicon 
(SONOS) memory, we integrate the 
nitride traps with NiSi2 nanocrystal by 
simply reactive sputtering NiSi2 in the 
mixture gas of argon (Ar) and ammonia 
(NH3) at room temperature (sample C). 
The C-V curves of sample C are shown 
in Fig.5(a), and the memory window 
under ± 15V operation is about 2V, 
which is not much different from sample 
A. The cross-sectional transmission 
electron microscope images are also 
shown in Fig. 5(b), and the density and 
diameter of nanocrystals are estimated to 
be 1.23×1012cm-2 and 5nm, respectively. 
 
 memory device of sample C, the 
retention characteristic is shown in Fig. 
7(b). Since the structure of NiSi2/SiNX 
CNCs is formed in sample C, the 
additional potential barrier of nitride can 
reduce the tunnel probability 
significantly and the traps contributed by 
nitride can be used as memory storing 
centers. Furthermore, the hydrogen 
atoms which were dissociated from NH3 
9 
during depositing nanocrystal charge 
storage layer could passivate the shallow 
traps of nitride. On account of the deep 
traps being well below 0.7 eV, the 
carriers trapped in deep traps were hard 
to escape during retention test. Hence, in 
spite of the endurance test has been 
implemented before the retention test, 
the decay ratio of memory window for 
104 seconds is still better than sample A 
and B in room temperature. According 
to the retention results, the proposed 
device with NiSi2/SiNX CNCs structure 
indeed exhibits superior reliability than 
traditional single-layer or even 
double-layer nanocrystals device.

voltage shift with pulse time, and (b) Retention characteristic 
after endurance test at room temperature. The retention 
characteristic is still better than double-layer structure 
(sample B) even undergoing endurance test. 
3-2-3 (Conclusion) 
We have fabricated double-layer 
(sample B) NCs and NiSi2/SiNX CNCs 
(sample C) as comparison samples with 
single-layer (sample A) to investigate 
the improvement of reliability based 
MOS memory capacitor. Since the 
coulomb blockade effect, the 
nanocrystal device with double-layer 
structure improves the charge retention 
performance indeed. This study also 
incorporates nitrogen into NiSi2 layer by 
sputtering in NH3 ambience, and the 
NiSi2/SiNX CNCs can be easily formed 
after rapid thermal annealing. 
Comparing with double-layer device, the 
nitride layer surrounding NiSi 
nanocrystals can provide the additional 
tunnel barrier and deep traps to further 
improve the charge retention 
characteristic. The combination of 
nitride based traps with nanocrystal by 
simple process indeed can provide 
superior memory reliability for next 
generation and high-integrated NVM 
applications.
