cycle d[n]/256. According to duty(t) and all internal 
parameters, the converter generates output voltage Vout 
on the load. The operation iterates until Vout is 
approaching to Vref. 
 
A. EPU (Error Process Unit)  
 
Fig.3 shows the EPU state diagram. If input 
serial_error is 1, then e[n]+1 and e[n] are not greater 
than +4. On the contrary, if serial_error is 0, then e[n]-1 
and e[n] are not less than -4. Obviously, it can be 
implemented with a 4-bit register to cover the range 
from -4 to +4. Table I shows the truth table and the logic 
equations.

C. Digital Pulse Width Modulation  
   
In Fig.2, the DPWM generates switching signals with 
a frequency fs and variable duty cycles according to the 
input values of d[n]. The DPWM is based on a 
multi-phase/counter approach. The multi-phase clock 
source is generated from the VCO of a PLL instead of a 
ring oscillator, which the former one can provide even 
more accurate timing leading to accurate duty ratio and 
lower ripple of the output regulated voltage. Notice that 
due to the effects of process and/or temperature 
variations, the output clock signals of the ring oscillator 
constructed with flip-flops may suffer serious jitter 
problems. 
The n-bit resolution can be achieved using nm-phase 
clock signals and the remaining nc-bit resolution is 
obtained from an nc-bit counter. Note that here n = nm + 
nc. The multi-phase signals 1, 2, 3,… are generated 
from a PLL, in which the VCO is constructed with a 
differential ring-oscillator as shown in Fig. 5.

Ⅴ. SUMMARY 
 
The supply voltage of the system including FPGA 
voltage is 3.3V, Vg is 3~4V and Vcmp is 3V. The output 
voltage is regulated at Vout = 1.8V. The power 
consumption of the converter is 240mW at Vg=3V and 
280mW at Vg=4V. The oscillator frequency for the 
FPGA is 32MHz. The power-up transient time is about 
150us as shown in Fig.12. The peak-to-peak voltage of 
the output ripple is about 80mV as shown in Fig.13. 
 
.Ⅵ  CONCLUSION 
   
This research report describes a serial digital 
PWM regulator. The proposed comparator and EPU 
replace the conventional A/D converter, which makes 
the implementation much more easily. Furthermore, the 
multipliers in PID compensator are replaced with 
look-up tables. The EPU, PID compensator and DPWM 
can use the hardware description language (HDL) to 
implement on FPGA and combines three ROMs that 
embed in FPGA form a regulator to control a buck 
converter at 1MHz switching frequency and regulated at 
1.8v.
