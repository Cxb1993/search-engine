Abstract
A non-steady-state mathematical model system for the kinetics of adsorption and biodegradation
of reactive black 5 (RB5) by Funalia trogii (F. trogii) 200800 biofilm in fly ash-chitosan bead
fluidized bed process was derived. The mechanisms in the model system included RB5 adsorption
by fly ash-chitosan beads, RB5 biodegradation by F. trogii cells and RB5 mass transport diffusion.
Batch kinetic tests were performed to determine surface diffusivity of RB5, adsorption parameters
for RB5 and biokinetic parameters of F. trogii 200800. Experiments were conducted using a
continuous flow fluidized bed reactor system to approximate a completely-mixed flow reactor for
model verification. The experimental results indicated that F. trogii biofilm bioregenerated the fly
ash-chitosan beads after attached F. trogii has grown significantly. The removal efficiency of RB5
by F. trogii was about 95% when RB5 concentration in the effluent was 0.32 mg/l at a steady-state
condition. The concentration of suspended E. coli cells reached up to 1.74 mg/l while the
thickness of attached E. coli cells was estimated to be 80μm at a steady-state condition by model
prediction. The comparisons of experimental data and model simulation show that fluidized bed
biofilm model system for RB5 adsorption and biodegradation can predict the experimental results
well. The approaches of experiments and modeling in this study can be applied to design a
full-scale fluidized bed process to treat reactive dye in textile wastewater.
Keywords: Adsorption, biodegradation, reactive black 5, fluidized bed, fly ash-chitosan composite
media, kinetic model system

1. Introduction
Synthetic dyes are extensively used for dyeing and printing in various industries.
Approximately 10,000 different dyes and pigments are produced annually worldwide and about
10% of which are lost in industrial effluents (Ünyayar et al. 2005). Large amount of, chemically
different dyes are used for various industrial applications such as textile dyeing, and a significant
proportion of these dyes enter the environment in wastewater (Park et al., 2007). Especially,
reactive dyes are the most common type of dyes because of their unique properties such as bright
colors. Even though it is treated with wastewater treatment, the solution contained reactive dyes
with some color (Choi et al. 2008). Besides, traditional physicochemical methods are ineffective
to remove reactive dyes (Jain and Gupta 2003; Eren and Acar 2006).
Biological fixed films exhibit properities that make them preferable to suspended-cell systems
for many continuous bioprocess applications. These properties include extremely high cell
concentrations, enhanced cell retention due to cell immobilization, and an increased resistance to
the detrimental effects of toxic shock loadings. Applications of fixed films are becoming more
numerous. The application of rotating biological contactors, trickling filters, fluidized beds, and
activated biofilters for wastewater treatment has been recently investigated.
While the pseudo-steady-state performance of fixed films has been extensively studied both
experimentally and theoretically, the unsteady-state behavior that results from sudden changes in
environmental conditions has received less attention. This behavior is important from both a
6the period of the column test.
2. Fly ash-chitosan bead kinetic model system
2.1 Model assumption
A mechanistic model of the experimental bioreactor has been developed to investigate the
roles of hydrodynamics, mass transfer, and reaction kinetics. The model is based on
unsteady-state mass balances on reactive black 5 within the bulk liquid and biofilm phases as well
as solid phases. Fig. 1 shows the conceptual basis of a fly ash-chitosan bead with F. trogii biofilm
attachment. Biofilm growth is also included. The unsteady-state biofilm model is based on the
following assumptions:
(1) The single-limiting substrate is reactive black 5.
(2) Mass transfer within the biofilm follows Fick’s law.
(3) The several microbial species within the biofilm can be adequately modeled as a single
“average”species.
(4) Production of new biomass is proportional to the consumption of reactive black 5.
(5) The fly ash-chitosan beads may be considered as spherical in shape with uniform size.
(6) The biofilm is uniform in thickness and composition.
2.2 Mathematical model development
The diffusion model considers the phenomena of internal diffusion and external convection on
fly ash-chitosan beads, including the mass transfer in the liquid film, the diffusion in the particle
pores as well as the surface adsorption rate (Adriano et al. 2005). Considering a fast adsorption on
8The equilibrium adsorption isotherm is of importance in the design of adsorption with
biodegradation system. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm assumes that adsorption takes place at
specific homogeneous sites within the adsorbent and has found successful application of many
sorption processes of monolayer adsorption (Wang et al. 2005). The local adsorption equilibrium
at the interface between the biofilm and the fly ash-chitosan bead can be described by Langmuir
isotherm. The Langmuir isotherm can be written in the form

where eQ is the adsorbed amount of RB5 (Ms/Mq); mQ is the Langmuir monolayer adsorption
capacity and qS is the equilibrium RB5 concentration at biofilm/bead interface (Ms/L
3) and aK
is the constant related to the free energy of adsorption. The non-steady-state form of mass transfer
and biodegradation reaction within biofilms, based on Fick’s law and Monod kinetics can be
expressed in spherical polar coordinates by the equation (Worden and Donaldson 1987; Tsai et al.
2005):

where fS is the RB5 concentration in the biofilm (Ms/L
3); fD is the diffusion coefficient of
RB5 in the biofilm (L2/T); and fr is the radial distance in the biofilm (L). Since the differential
equation share the same boundary at the biofilm-bead interface, the boundary condition must be
satisfied for Equation (6) as well. It must be also be noted that at the biofilm-bead interface the
flux across the interface from the liquid phase must be balanced by the flux across the interface

feed; fN is the mass flux of the RB5 into the biofilm; and sA is the total surface area of the
solid phase. Equation (10) is coupled to the biofilm equation through application of Fick’s law at
the outer surface of the biofilm to describe the flux of RB5 from the bulk liquid into the biofilm:
 sbff SSkN  (11)
A second important quantity is the flux of RB5 across the biofilm-bead interface into fly
ash-chitosan bead. The flux is important because it justifies whether fly ash-chitosan bead is
adsorbing or desorbing RB5. When the value of flux is positive, the RB5 is diffusing from the
biofilm into chitosan bead. However, a negative value of flux represents the RB5 is desorbed out
of fly ash-chitosan bead. The flux across the interface of biofilm and fly ash-chitosan bead is
computed with

Since the reactor is operated at a high recycle flow rate and the recycle system can be
considered as a part of control volume, thus, the mass balance of suspended F. trogii in the bulk

reactive black 5. The pH was adjusted to 4.5 by using 2,2-dimethyl succinic acid. KBS medium
for dye-degrading bacteria was prepared by dissolving (Park et al. 2007): glucose 5g; ammonium
tartrate, 0.22 g; KH2PO4, 0.2 g; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05g; CaCl2, 0.01 g; thiamine-HCl, 0.001 g; 10%
tween solution, 10 ml; veratryl alcohol, 0.23 ml; trace element solution, 10 ml. Trace elements
solution contains the following compositions (g/l of deionized/distilled water0: CuSO4·7H2O,
0.08; H2MoO4, 0.05; MnSO4·4H2O, 0.07; ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.043 and Fe2(SO4)3, 0.05. Cultivation
flasks were incubated on a shaking incubator (Deng Yng, E600L, 104 Instrument, Taipei, Taiwan)
4. Experimental methods
4.1. Adsorption experiments
Adsorption isotherm studies were conducted for RB5 to evaluate the fly ash-chitosan bead
adsorption capacity for reactive-dye constituents. Five batch tests were required to evaluate two
adsorption parameters ( mQ and aK ) in the adsorption isotherm experiments. Batch adsorption
studies were carried out by contacting 0.5 g, 1 g, 3 g, 6 g, 10 g of fly ash-chitosan beads with 500
ml of dye solution of 50 mg/l initial RB5 concentration in 1000 ml beaker. The beakers were
agitated and stirred continuously under constant temperature of 280C for 3 h to achieve
equilibrium (Jain et al. 2003).
4.2. Adsorption kinetic experiments
To determine the surface diffusivity (Ds) of RB5 in fly ash-chitosan bead, a batch kinetic test
was conducted using 3g of fly ash-chitosan bead with 500 ml of dye solution with 50 mg/l of RB5
14
4.4. Analytical methods
RB5 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm using a UV-vis
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, model UV-1700) (Park et al. 2007). The RB5 concentration was
found to follow the following regression equation: RB5 (mg/l) = 0.005649 + 42.906 (OD600). The
RB5 concentration was measured by filtering appropriate volume of sample through a 0.45 μm
membrane filter. Attached F. trogii cells were quantified on a dry-weight-of-biofilm basis. At the
end of the experiment, 100 fly ash-chitosan beads were transferred, one by one with a tweezer
into a preweighed aluminum pan, dried to a constant weight at 100C, and then weighed again;
this measurement provided the weight of fly ash-chitosan plus dry attached T. trogii cells. The
dried fly ash-chiltosan beads with attached T. trogii cells was then treated twice with 30-ml,
aliquots of 1M NaOH for 15 min with occasional vigorous swirling to remove the attached F.
trogii cells (Worden and Donaldson 1987). The fly ash-chitosan beads were rinsed several times
with distilled water to flush away attached F. trogii cells remnants, dried and weighed again. Dry
weight of clean fly ash-chitosan was then calculated by subtracting the weight of clean fly
ash-chitosan beads from the weight of fly ash-chitosan beads with attached F. trogii cells.
5. Results and discussion
5.1. Adsorption kinetics
An integrated model system incorporating mechanisms of solid-phase diffusion in the fly
ash-chitosan particle with BR5 kinetic adsorption in the bulk liquid was developed to determine
intraparticle diffusion coefficient (Ds). The surface diffusion model in the fly ash-chitosan particle

al. 2005; Choi et al. 2008). The values of mQ and aK obtained from Fig. 5 were equal to 6.68
(mg/g) and 0.141 (L/mg), respectively.
5.3. Biokinetic parameters determination
A batch kinetic test with RB5 concentration and F. trogii cells was conducted to determine the
maximum specific substrate utilization rate ( k ), growth yield ( gY ), Monod half-saturation
constant ( sK ) and microbial decay rate ( dk ). The variations of RB5 decolorization and the
growth of suspended F. trogii cells versus operation time were depicted in Fig. 6. As shown in
Fig. 6, the RB5 concentration deceased with time by suspended F. trogii cells due to
biodegradation. The concentration data of RB5 and F. trogii cells facilitate a priori estimation of
biokinetic parameters by evaluating the growth rate of F. trogii cells and decolorization rate of
RB5. The relevant techniques employed for estimation of biokinetic parameters from batch data
are discussed here. In a batch reactor, for modeling of F. trogii cells change with time, a simple
biokinetic model with two components was chosen. The mathematical expressions for these two
components are as follows.

where gY is the growth yield. For small changes in the F. trogii cells and RB5 concentrations in
the growth phase, equation (17) can be integrated to yield the relation (Ucun et al. 2010):

The decay rate of F. trogii cells )( dk can thus be determined from the slope of a linearized
plot of Xln versus time in the endogenous phase as shown in Fig. 9. The value of decay
coefficient ( dk ) was equal to 0.039 day
-1.
5.4. Mass Transfer Coefficients
The molecular diffusion coefficients in water Dw and in biofilm Df for RB5 were determined
from the empirical formula of Hayduk and Laudie (1974). The formula can be described by the
following equation:
589.014.1
51026.13

where μis absolute viscosity of the solution in centipoises (cP) and Va is molar volume of the
solute as liquid at its normal boiling point. Molar volumes of solutes can be computed from the
individual atomic volume. For RB5, Va = 878.2 cm3/mol. Therefore, Dw = 2.44×10-6 cm2/s =
0.211 cm2/day.
Diffusion coefficients in the biofilm are smaller than in the liquid phase due to the diffusional
resistance to the transport of the substrate, which is posed by bacteria and their extracellular
materials. Therefore, the diffusion coefficient in the biofilm is obtained by multiplying the
diffusion coefficient in the bulk liquid phase by a factor of 0.8 to correct the additional diffusional

test using fly ash-chitosan beads as the supporting media was conducted to investigate the RB5
adsorption and biodegradation in a fluidized bed process. The model-generated and experimental
results of RB5 adsorption with biodegradation by F. trogii cells for column test are shown in Fig.
10. The model simulated the experimental results well throughout the entire courses of the test.
The performance of the fluidized bed process can be described by four parts. First, the RB5
concentration increased steadily up to about 1.55 mg/l (0.226 Sb0) at two days. During this period,
F. trogii cells growth inside the reactor for RB5 biodegradation were not significant. The reactor
was behaving similar to a fly ash-chitosan bead adsorber. At this stage, fly ash-chitosan bead was
adsorbing RB5 without any significant resistance to the diffusion of the RB5 posed by the
attached F. trogii cells.
The second part of RB5 curve ran from two to six days, when the RB5 curve started to deviate
from the breakthrough curve of fly ash-chitosan bead adsorber. The RB5 effluent concentration
leveled off and then began to decrease during this period of time. Both phenomena confirm the
active biodegradation of RB5 by attached F. trogii cells and that F. trogii biofilm was growing
significantly during the second period. The third part of the RB5 curve ran from six to 42 days.
The RB5 concentration maintained a constant level which represented the steady-state condition.
The RB5 concentration was approximately 0.32 mg/l (0.0465 Sb0) during this period of the
steady-state condition. The RB5 concentration reached a steady-state level, which was equivalent
to about 95% removal efficiency for RB5.

period should have been higher than that at the steady-state level. The growth curve of suspended
F. trogii cells showed a peak at 8 days during bioregeneration. The growth of F. trogii cells
reached a steady-state condition after operation time of 12 days. The F. trogii cells concentration
was maintained at 1.74 mg cell/l at the steady-state condition.
5.7 Reactive black 5 flux into biofilm and chitosan bead
The mechanisms considered in fluidized bed kinetic model include diffusion, adsorption and
biodegradation in this study. Fig. 12 presents the flux of RB5 into biofilm ( fN ) along with the
flux of RB5 into fly ash-chitosan beads ( qN ). The figure shows that the values of fN and qN
were equal and started out a larger value that was controlled totally by adsorption at the beginning
of the fluidized bed column test because RB5 biodegradation by F. trogii biofilm was negligible at
the start of the test. Most of RB5 was removed by adsorption of fly ash-chitosan beads at the start
of fluidized bed column test.
The curves of fN and qN started to deviate with each other from the start of the test, when
the F. trogii biofilm started to grow actively. The fN decreased rapidly as the F. trogii biofilm
start to grow from 0 to 1 days because adsorption slowed the development of an F. trogii biofilm
by decreasing the RB5 concentration “seen”by the F. trogii biofilm during this period of time.
Then, the fN began to increase reversely after bioregeneration of fly ash-chitosan beads from 1
days to 2 days because the flux was diffusing from fly ash-chitosan beads into biofilm, which
represented the desorption of the RB5. In sequence, fN reached a constant level at the
steady-state condition after qN approached to zero and RB5 removal was initially dominated by
24
biodegradation by F. trogii biofilm became the dominant mechanism responsible for the
steady-state removal of RB5 in the fluidized bed process.
5.8. Microbial distribution on fly ash-chitosan beads
Fig. 13 presents scanning electron micrograph (SEM) photos of original fly ash-chitosan beads
and F. trogii cells distributed on the surface of fly ash-chitosan beads. The microscopic
observation reveals that the original chitosan bead has an uneven surface to make a roughness for
F. trogii cells to attach easily (Fig.13(a)). The attached F. trogii cells, along with their extracellular
materials, were preserved well and distinctly identified from SEM micrographs. The rod-shaped
bacterial was observed during the initial phase (day 1) of colonization were roughly 5 m wide
and 15m long (Fig. 13(b)). Rod-shaped attached F. trogii cells were uniformly distributed on the
surface of fly ash-chitosan bead with a highly dense population on day 6 in the fluidized bed test,
which made fluidized bed reactor system have a high attached and suspended F. trogii cells
growth (Fig. 13(c)). Rod-shaped attached F. trogii cells were uniformly distributed on the surface
of fly ash-chitosan bead with a highly dense population on day 12 in the fluidized bed column test
(Fig. 13(d)), which made fluidized bed reactor system have a high RB5 removal efficiency at a
steady state condition.
6. Conclusions
The mathematical model system was derived to describe the adsorption and biodegradation of
RB5 by F .trogii 200800 in fluidized bed process. The completely-mixed, fluidized bed process
was conducted to validate the model. The experimental data and model prediction in effluent

results in formation of numerous by-products which are potentially harmful to human health
(Myllykangas et al. 2002). Among all chlorinated by-products, trihalomethanes, which have
potential carcinogenic activity, comprise a class of compounds that have been investigated
thoroughly over the last 20 years (Gallard &Gunten 2002).
As a powerful oxidant, ozone can transform some refractory organic matters to biodegradable
organic carbon, which can be removed easily through biodegradation (Wu et al. 2004). Oxidation
of natural organic matter (NOM) by ozone increases biodegradability by reducing molecule size
and increasing the number of oxygenated functional groups (Van der Kooij et al. 1989; Graham
1999). Moreover, ozonation increases the amount of dissolved oxygen in water and enhances
nitrification of the packed-bed biofilter. Combining ozonation and biofiltration generally enhances
natural organic matter (NOM) biodegradability and increases overall NOM removal as compared
with biofiltration alone (Van der Kooij et al. 1989). Most applications of ozonation combined
with biofiltration to drinking water treatment are focused on removing various organic and
inorganic matters, such as humic acids, carbohydrates and ammonium-nitrogen (Yavich et al.
2004; Wang et al. 2008). Currently, ozone oxidation combined with a subsequent biological
filtration is applied by some water treatment plants as a cost-efficient and high-performance
operation process (Seredyńska-Sobecka et al. 2005).
No studies have evaluated the fate of MW and functional groups of micropollutants during
pre-ozonation and biofiltration treatment process using gel chromatography and infrared
spectroscopy. The aim of this work is to observe the characteristic transformation of humic acid
via TOC, UV and TOC/UV as water-quality indices when pre-ozonation and biofiltration are used
as a combined process. The functional groups of organic compounds were detected to assess their
biodegradability at different ozone dosages. The effects of ozonation and biofiltration on
molecular-size distribution and functional group transformations were also investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
To simulate the characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM), synthetic raw water containing
humic acid, sucrose and ammonium-nitrogen was prepared as the influent source using chemical
reagents. The synthetic raw water containing 10 mg/l humic acid, 5 mg/l sucrose and 2 mg/l
NH4+-N was oxidized by ozone doses of 0.1 and 0.4 mg O3/mg TOC, respectively, and then fed
into a packed-bed biofilter for biodegradation at 100 m/day. Samples were then analyzed before
and after ozonation and biofiltration in a water treatment process.

Analytical methods
The pH of all sample solutions was first adjusted to 7.5. Samples were then filtrated using
0.45-μm membrane filter (Millipore Ltd, Watford, UK). The filtrated liquid was then concentrated
20-40 times using a rotary vacuum evaporator (Bűchi Labortechnik AG). The concentrated liquid
was centrifuged for 2 min at 700 × g (Hsiangtai Centrifuge MCD-2000). The liquor was then
fractionated using G-25. The precipitated organic compounds were freeze-dried by a Labconco
Freeze Dryer system (Model 76705-20, Labconco, Kansas, MO, USA). The functional groups of
organic compounds were then analyzed using infrared spectroscopy (400-4,000 cm-1) with the use
of a Hitachi 260-30 IR spectrometer (Ma et al. 2001). To determine the behaviors of organic
compounds in a combined process of ozonation and biofiltration, TOC was used as the primary
water-quality index. Additionally, UV-absorbance at 290 nm wave-lengths was used as
complementary general quality indices to evaluate the behaviors of organic compounds due to the
highest absorbance value as shown in Figure 2.

Sephadex G-25. The calibrants from gel filtration were measured using UV290 and TOC to
fractionate into groups. Four groups for G-25 were determined by distribution coefficient (Kav).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Molecular-size distribution by G-25
The soluble organic compounds can be divided into four characteristic groups via the G-25
gel-chromatogram using UV290 and TOC as water-quality indices. Figure 4a presents organic
compounds in synthetic raw water with two different characteristic groups distributed in groups 2
and 3. The molecular weight at distribution peaks in group 2 and 3 is roughly 3204 and 512
g/mole, respectively. The distribution patterns of UV290 and TOC relative to groups 2 and 3 are
symmetrical. The MW of organic compounds in group 2 includes most humic acid. In group 3,
the MW includes most sucrose molecules and low molecular-size humic acid. The ratio of highest
TOC versus UV290 is approximately 22:1 for group 2 and 288:1 for group 3. The percentage of
TOC in groups 2 and 3 is 80% and 20%, respectively.

biofiltration was roughly 55%. The biodegradability of ozonated water during biofiltration
increased in group 2 and 4 as ozone dose increased from 0.1 to 0.4 mg O3/mg TOC. The
TOC/UV290 ratio decreased from 47 to 32 in group 2 as some of UV290–insensitive organic
compounds was removed by biofiltration. Moreover, the TOC/UV290 ratio increased from 29 to 35
in group 3 after biofiltration, indicating that some of UV290-sensitive organic compounds were
removed by biofitration. The TOC/UV290 ratio increased by approximately 38% in group 4
following biofiltration indicating the UV290-insensitive organic compounds such as
polysaccharides were biodegraded by biofiltration. The molecular-size range in group 4 is 180-92.
As mentioned, ozonation at an ozone dosage of 0.4 mg O3/mg TOC increases the amount of
UV-insensitive biodegradable organic carbon for subsequent biofiltration, demonstrating that
increased ozone dose increased biodegradability. Seger & Rothman (1996) reported that the
removal efficiency of DOC increased from 20 to 30% as ozone dosage increased from 0.2 to 1.0
mg O3/mg TOC. Table 1 summarizes TOC distribution percentage and ratio of TOC to UV290 in
each group by Sephadex G-25

Functional groups by IR spectroscopy
The IR spectrum of humic acid in synthetic raw water is presented in Figure 5a. Strong bands are
evident near 3400, 1400, 920, and 700 cm-1. The 3400 cm-1 band is probably arises from OH
group of phenols (Wei et al. 2007). The absorption in the 1400 cm-1 region was attributed to
stretching C–O of tertiary alcohols, which is consistent with the study of humic acid
characteristics, indicating that humic acid has a strong band in the range of 1350-1500 cm-1 due to
the presence of stretching C–O of tertiary alcohols (Mozia et al. 2005). The intensity of the 1700
cm-1 band was markedly reduced in intensity when humic acid was the salt form. This finding
agrees with that obtained by Stevenson & Goh (1971). The band near 1060 cm-1 in the spectra of
humic acid was attributed to C–O vibrations in secondary alcohols. The absorption between 920

ABSTRACT
A combined treatment process of pre-ozonation with biofiltration was conducted to evaluate
organic matter distribution of micropollutants by gel chromatography. The molecular weight
(MW) distribution of humic acid by Sephadex G-25 was observed from groups 2
(MW=7031-1029 g/mole) and 3 (MW=1029-303 g/mole) shifted to groups 2, 3 and 4 (MW<303
g/mole) under ozone doses of 0.1 and 0.4 mg O3/mg TOC. The shift in molecular weight increases
as ozone dosage increases. Biofiltration effectively degraded the organic molecule of group 2;
however, the biofiltration only slightly degraded the organic molecule of group 4. Increased ozone
dose destroyed functional groups C=C in phenolic and C–O in alcoholic compounds and
increased UV-insensitive biodegradable organic carbon for subsequent biofiltration. Biofiltration
effectively degraded organic compounds of alcohols and alkenes at an ozone dose of 0.1 mg
O3/mg TOC. Experimental approaches in this study can be applied to evaluate and diagnose the
function of a full-scale process combining ozonation and biofiltration in drinking water treatment
plants.

INTRODUCTION
In Taiwan, most river water contains excessive amounts of humic substances and other organic
pollutants associated with ammonia. Decomposing these pollutants by using pre-chlorination in
water treatment plant is prevalent. However, the reaction of humic substances with chlorine
4The synthetic raw water for the experiments composed a stock solution with tap water and was
stored in a 50 l mixing tank. Ozone was generated from dried pure oxygen through a 0.22-m
membrane filter (Millipose, GS) using a Welshbach T-816 Ozone Generator (San Jose, CA, USA).
The oxygen flow rate was controlled at 1.0 l min-1 with a pressure of 7.5 psig. The synthetic raw
water was fed into a 20 l ozone contactor. A 17 l batch reactor, 11 cm in diameter and 2 m high
made of polymethylmethacrylate, was employed to facilitate the operation of all ozone-based
oxidation processes. Two potassium iodide (KI) traps in series were employed to effectively
collect the residual ozone from off-gas contactor top (Chin & Bérubé 2005). Following ozonation,
effluent flowed into a 60-l holding tank to dissipate residual ozone.
A down-flow biofilter containing two different biofilm media, anthracites and gravel, was used to
degrade the ozonated water. Anthracites were employed as the biofilm media because they have a
rough surface appropriate for biofilm attachment. The gravel was used as support media at reactor
bottom. The biofilter, 2 m and with an inner diameter of 2.5 cm, had a total volume of 15.8 l. The
biofilter was packed approximately 50% of the total biofilter volume with anthracites and gravel
stones as biofilm media. Anthracite and gravel-layer porosity was 0.49 and 0.39, respectively. The
synthetic raw water with inoculum obtained from the activated sludge unit in a wastewater
treatment plant (Tainan, Taiwan) was fed into the biofilter at 100 m/l for biofilm growth. After 3
months incubation, the biofilter was replenished with ozonated water and feeding was initiated.
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of pre-ozonation with biofiltration treatment process.

Figure 2 Humic acid UV spectra
TOC measurements were conducted as purgeable TOC with a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR)
analyzer (Beckman Instruments Inc., CA, USA). The inorganic carbon (IC) in samples was
purged using pure nitrogen. Samples were then injected into a 950°C column to determine the
amount of TOC. At least three measurements were made for each sample, and analytical precision
was typically less than ±3%. Ultraviolet (UV) absorbance was measured with a Shimadzu
UV-2500 UV/VIS spectrometer using a quartz cell with 1-cm path lengths of 290 nm.
Gel filtration chromatography
The gel was added as a slurry to a 100 × 2.6 cm column to generate a total bed volume of 84.7 ml.
The void volume (V0) of the column was measured based on elution volume of Blue Dextran
2000, which cannot diffuse into the inner portion of gel particles due to its large molecular size,
and has no adsorbability to the gel (Hine & Bursill 1984). The V0 of G-25 is 144 ml and 192 ml,
respectively. The group MW for Sephadex G-25 was determined using the following reference
compounds: polyethylene glycol (MW = 4000); polyethylene glycol (MW = 400); glucose (MW

8Figure 4b shows the chromatographic fraction of ozonated water at an ozone dosage of 0.1 mg
O3/mg TOC. The molecular weight at distribution peaks in group 2 and 4 is approximately 2690
and 196 g/mole, respectively. The organic molecules were distributed in groups 2, 3 and 4. The
percentage of TOC in groups 2, 3 and 4 were 16%, 15% and 69%, respectively. The amount of
TOC decreased from 80% to 16% in group 2 due to oxidation of high molecular-size humic acid.
Furthermore, the molecules in synthetic raw water in group 3 slightly shifted to group 4,
suggesting that some organic compounds in group 3 was oxidized by ozone. The amount of TOC
decreased from 20% to 15% in group 3, resulting from cleavage of sucrose and humic acid
molecules in group 3. The ratios of TOC versus UV290 in groups 2, 3 and 4 are 92:1, 156:1 and
207:1.
Figure 4c presents the molecular-size distribution after addition of 0.4 mg O3/mg TOC. The
molecular weight at distribution peaks in groups 2, 3 and 4 is approximately 2070, 558 and 214
g/mole, respectively. The TOC percentages in groups 2, 3 and 4 are 47%, 29% and 24%,
respectively. The TOC/UV290 ratios in groups 2, 3 and 4 are 110:1, 170:1 and 313:1, respectively.
Comparing total organic mass of Figure 4a and Figure 4c demonstrated that the TOC percentage
decreased from 80 to 47% in group 2, suggesting some humic acid molecules in group 2 were
transformed into those of groups 3 and 4. The low organic molecules in group 4 were due to
cleavage of sucrose and humic acid in groups 2 and 3. Ozonation at increased ozone doses results
in more formation of biodegradable organic matter (Seredyńska-Sobecka et al. 2005).
Figure 4d presents the molecular-size distribution of organic compounds after biofiltration of
ozonated water with ozone dose of 0.1 mg O3/mg TOC mg. The molecular weight at distribution
peaks in groups 2 and 4 is approximately 2465 and 196 g/mole, respectively. The TOC
percentages in groups 2, 3 and 4 were 15%, 10% and 75%, respectively. The biodegradation
effectively reduced the amount of organic carbon in groups 2, 3 and 4. However, UV290
absorbance did not significantly change during biofiltration, suggesting some refractory humic
acid was not biodegraded. Approximately 28% of TOC in ozonated water was removed by
biofiltration. Additionally, the ratio of TOC/UV290 for group 2, 3 and 4 is 25, 125 and 112. A
significant decrease in the ratio of TOC/UV290 revealed that organic carbon can be effectively
degraded by microorganisms during biofiltration. Compared with the total mass of organic carbon
in (Figures 4b & 4d), the TOC removal efficiency in groups 2, 3 and 4 was 33%, 54% and 21%,
respectively.
Figure 4e shows the chromatographic fraction of molecular distribution after biofiltration of
ozonated water with 0.4 mg O3/mg TOC. The molecular weight at distribution peaks in groups 2,
3 and 4 is roughly 2690, 512 and 179 g/mole, respectively. TOC distribution percentage in group
2, 3 and 4 was 32%, 35% and 33%, respectively. The ratios of TOC to UV290 for groups 2, 3 and 4
were 166, 272 and 131, respectively. The removal efficiency of TOC in group 2, 3 and 4 was 65%,
40% and 31%, respectively. The TOC removal of ozonated water by microorganisms during

Figure 5b presents some transitions in the molecular structure of functional groups due to
ozonation with an ozone dosage of 0.1 mg O3/mg TOC. The absorption band at 3400 cm-1 was
reduced. Additionally, absorption peaks appeared near 1400 cm-1 (stretching C–O of tertiary
alcohols) was declined. The adsorption band at 1140 cm-1 (stretching C–O of secondary alcohols)
was increased since pre-ozonation made high molecules cleaved into low molecules. The
adsorption band at 850-670 cm-1 (C-H vibrations of alkenes) was reduced due to pre-ozonation
(Mozia et al. 2005; Wei et al. 2007).
Figure 5c shows the IR spectral distribution of humic acid following biofiltration of ozonated
water at an ozone dose of 0.1 mg O3/mg TOC. The absorption intensities at 3400, 1400, 1140, 850
and 670 cm-1 had clearly declined due to biodegradation. Most alcoholic and alkenes compounds
were degraded by biofiltration. This experimental finding indicated a reduction in intermediate
and low MW organic compounds due to biodegradation. Similar experimental results were
obtained by Wei et al. (2007), who identified a decrease in low MW carbohydrates (e.g.., amylase)
due to biodegradation of municipal solid waste compost containing a significant amount of humic
acid.

CONCLUSIONS
A combined process of ozonation and biofiltration was evaluated using TOC, UV, TOC/UV and
IR spectra as water-quality indices to identify the transformation of MW and functional groups.
The molecular-size distribution can be classified into four groups using reference compounds with
Sephadex G-25. The biodegradability of ozonated water can be increased significantly when
ozone dosage is increased from 0.1 to 0.4 mg O3/mg TOC. Approximately 37-49% of TOC in
ozonated water with ozone dose of 0.1-0.4 mg O3/mg TOC were removed by biofiltration.
Ozonation caused a decrease in UV-sensitive organic carbon and an increase in the UV-insensitive
biodegradable organic carbon for subsequent biofiltration. The increase of ozone dosage can
increase biodegradability. The ratio of TOC/UV290 can be utilized as a water index evaluating the
treatability of UV-sensitive and UV-insensitive organic compounds in water treatment process.
The IR analysis provides useful information for characterizing the variations of functional groups
of organic compounds during a treatment process combining ozonation and biofiltration. The
ozone dosage of 0.1 mg O3/mg TOC destroyed some phenolic alcoholic compounds in synthetic
raw water. Biofiltration effectively degraded alcoholic organic compounds and alkenes at ozone
dose of 0.1 mg O3/mg TOC. Detailed specific organic compounds should be identified by GC/MS
to enhance the understanding of the fate of organic compounds during the ozonation and
biofiltration. The experimental approaches in this study provide a basis for evaluating and
diagnosing the function of a full-scale combined process of ozonation and biofiltration in drinking
water treatment plants.
