Chapter 1. Transcription factor binding sites database 
1.1 Introduction 
Eukaryotic gene expression is achieved by multiple layers of regulation, including transcription 
regulation, which requires transcription factors (TFs) to bind to their respective DNA binding 
sites (TFBSs) in a correct spatial and temporal manner (1). Identifying and characterizing the 
binding sites of TFs can permit a more comprehensive and quantitative mapping of the regulatory 
mechanisms within cells. Unfortunately, TFBSs are usually short (~ 5-15 bp) and degenerate (2), 
making it difficult to define TFBSs experimentally or computationally. 
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are only a limited number of functional TFBSs that have 
been experimentally verified (3). Inference of TFBSs has thus been relying heavily on 
computational approaches. A number of plausible motif consensus sequences have been deduced 
by different bioinformatics methods that exploit sequence information. However, there have been 
reservations on using those consensuses to annotate the genome due to excessive false positives. 
Fortunately, the ChIP-chip technique (4-5) provides a powerful way to verify the DNA-binding 
affinity of TFs. In addition, phylogenetic footprinting methods that assume conservation of 
functional elements during evolution have been utilized to reveal TFBSs that are conserved 
across species (6-7). 
A fair amount of confident TFBS information has been accumulated in various databases 
during the last few years. For example, SCPD (3), SGD (8), TRANSFAC (9), YPD (10) and 
YEASTRACT (11) contain an array of TF motif consensus sequences derived from the literature 
and experimental data. Some of them use simple sequence matching schemes to annotate the 
genome, which is noisy. SGD in particular remaps the TFBSs inferred by Harbison et al. (5), 
which took advantage of ChIP-chip data and phylogenetic information. However, SGD has a 
priori assumptions about the degree of conservation across species and binding affinities of TFs. 
SwissRegulon (12-13) is another database where the site annotations were produced using several 
algorithms to perform on related genomes in combination with known sites from the literature, in 
addition to using ChIP-chip binding data. SwissRegulon contains a variety of experimentally 
verified or computationally predicted TFBSs for the entire genomes of 18 organisms. However, 
SwissRegulon currently lacks information about the degree of conservation across species and 
related condition-specific ChIP-chip experiments for TFBSs.  
Since the degree of conservation across species and binding affinities of TFs vary among TFs, 
we construct a comprehensive web server, mining yeast binding sites (MYBS), which integrates 
several types of data related to transcriptional regulation in S. cerevisiae. Via simple motif or 
gene queries, MYBS allows users to apply ChIP-chip data and phylogenetic footprinting filters 
on genomic data to perform dynamic binding site mapping. 
4 
 
target/non-target gene sets of a pair of TFs in different combinations. 
For each function, MYBS allows users to search for occurrences of possible binding sites 
computationally without using any filters or by applying two filters --- phylogenic information 
and ChIP-chip data --- to improve the accuracy of binding site search. The user may request that a 
TFBS be conserved across a user-defined number of species (ranging from zero to seven) within 
a neighboring region of 25 bp upstream and downstream of the binding site occurrence in S. 
cerevisiae. In addition, the user can alter the degree of experimental support for TF-DNA binding 
affinity by setting the p value in a ChIP-chip experiment. 
The underlying core of MYBS is the integration of motif information. Each motif is linked to 
one or more TFs, and points to a set of genes whose promoter sequences contain incidences of the 
motif. Similarly, there may be multiple consensuses accrued from various sources listed for a 
given TF (Figure 1.1). The bi-directional search can start from a TF, a motif, or a gene, and 
allows for easy identification of regulatory associations between TFs and between motifs. For 
example, the user can query a short sequence pattern (I.U.B. code allowed) to acquire a list of 
matching binding motif consensuses. One can choose a motif from the list for detailed 
information, including its corresponding TFs, the sequence logo, the position weight matrices 
(PWMs) and the cutoff thresholds of the PWMs. In addition, MYBS allows users to scan any 
given sequences for binding occurrences of the selected motif. The user can further select which 
TF he/she is interested in. With the choice of either or both of two user-defined filters, MYBS 
provides a potential target gene list of the selected motif and allows the user to look into 
visualized sequence information for one or multiple genes simultaneously. The user can include 
or exclude certain databases in the process, and also discover other potential regulators of the 
selected genes. All related information can be downloaded as plain text files or image files.  
In order to give the user an idea of the significance of the TF predicted to be enriched in a 
given group of target genes, we calculate an enrichment p-value for each TF in “Search 
regulatory association”. This is done by calculating the probability of finding x or more 
promoters in a user-input gene set that can be bound by the specified TF, in addition to fulfilling 
the ChIP-chip and conservation requirements set by the user:

where M is the overall number of genes examined, K is the subset of M that are bound by the TF, 
N is the size of the user-input gene set, and x is the number of promoters within the user-input set 
that are bound by the TF. 
Since the calculation is done for every single TF, the p-value calculation, which could be 
computationally intensive, is made optional by the user. If the button “Calculate enrichment 
p-value” is clicked, an enrichment p-value will be shown for each TF in either the text or 
graphical output.  
6 
 
The 2  statistic follows a chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom (3-1)x(3-1). The 
p-value gives the user an idea of the probability of the two TFs being associated in a non-random 
manner. Note that we assign a default p-value of 1 if the expected number of genes E11 
simultaneously bound by TF1 and TF2 exceeds the observed number of genes O11. 
Since MYBS allows users to dynamically select different criteria for desired TFBSs, it is not 
easy to know the reliability of the MYBS predictions. To address this issue, for 101 
experimentally verified TFBSs of 12 TFs (21) we analyzed their corresponding ChIP-chip p 
values and the degree of conservation. Overall, 12 sites failed to be recognized by the PWMs of 
the corresponding TF in the MYBS database. Figure 1.2 shows the range of ChIP-chip p values 
of these target genes and their degree of conservation across species. As shown, ~65% of 
promoters where the experimentally verified TFBSs reside have ChIP-chip p values < 0.01 and 
more than 70% experimentally verified TFBSs are conserved in at least three species.

Similarly, the identification of target genes for TF pairs could serve as a starting point for analysis 
of combinatorial regulation of TFs. Through the user-friendly interface, MYBS allows for 
dynamic binding site mapping, in addition to visualization and elucidation of potential regulatory 
relationships.

performed on 111 intron-containing genes sensitive to Dep1p loss. The search provides a contact map of the genes 
against all TFs, and the map is sorted according to the number of regulatory interactions; in the map, a red block 
represents a regulatory relationship between a gene and a TF under user-defined criteria and a black block indicates 
the absence of regulatory relationship. According to the results, 69 of the 111 genes might be jointly regulated by 
FHL1 and RAP1.

of signal intensity on the true binding site. The idea behind this ranking scheme is that a true 
motif might evolve into different forms during evolution. Note further that accounting for the TF 
binding strength from ChIP-chip data has been shown to improve the reliability of inferred motifs 
(40). So, our method weights the contribution of each putative promoter sequence according to 
the probability in the ChIP-chip data that a TF binds to that promoter. 
2.2 Materials and Methods 
0 shows the flow chart of the proposed method. For TF α, ChIP-chip data is used to select a 
positive set (denoted by G ) of promoter regions bound by TF α and a negative (control) set 
(denoted by G) of non-bound promoter-regions (41). G is used in two mining steps to identify 
overrepresented subsequences, while G is employed to do pattern filtering and ranking. The 
first mining step employs a prefix-scanning procedure for growing compact motif blocks; a 
compact block is a motif or part of a motif that admits at most one wildcard. Patterns that are 
found in G with a proportion larger than a pre-defined value are included in the pattern list. At 
the end of the first step, long enough patterns (containing at least six non-wildcards) are taken as 
candidate motifs. Short patterns (blocks of 3 or 4 bp) are filtered and the remaining patterns are 
used in the second mining step, where each possible pair of short motif blocks are concatenated, 
allowing a number of successive wildcards in between the two blocks. After that, we sort the 
collected patterns, including the un-gapped and gapped ones, based on the positions they bind, 
their degrees of conservation across related species, and their preferential occurrences in the 
promoters of the positive set relative to the negative set. Finally, patterns with high scores are 
merged into clusters according to their similarity in the derived position frequency matrices 
(PFMs). 
Growing compact blocks 
A compact block is a motif or part of a motif that admits at most only one wildcard. We require a 
motif block to have at least three non-wildcards, e.g., „CGG‟, „AnCG‟, or „AnCGCGT‟. Growing 
motif blocks involves a procedure named bounded-prefix-growth, which takes a pattern and its 
projected database as inputs, and tries to extend the pattern by appending one more non-wildcard 
to its suffix at a time. For details about the procedure of bounded-prefix-growth and the definition 
of projected databases, see (42). The major advantage of using pattern growth (data-driven 
approaches) over examining all possible k-mer motifs (pattern-driven approaches) is that the 
search space can be effectively reduced. Another advantage is that it is not required to set the 
maximum length of a motif in advance. 0 provides an example with five input sequences of how 
a pattern tree is grown from scratch. The sequences that match the pattern are called the 
supporting sequences of a pattern. It is possible that a pattern matches a sequence at more than 
one position. Here, we define the Hit/Seq ratio of a pattern as the average number of occurrences 
of a pattern among its supporting sequences. As explained below in „Block filtering‟, Hit/Seq is 
helpful in screening out noisy compact blocks. 
Block filtering

Figure 2.2 An illustration of growing a pattern tree using the bounded-prefix-growth procedure. A node in the pattern 
tree denotes a pattern candidate, accompanied by its complete projected database. The projected database is the 
collection of sequences with a match to the qualified sequence suffix pattern in the forward or reverse complement 
DNA sequence. The support for a pattern is defined as the ratio of distinct sequences (S1, S2, and so on) each with a 
match to the pattern over the total number of sequences in the original database. A pattern may match a sequence at 
more than one position. These sequences are denoted as S1.1, S1.2, and S1.3 in the projected database. 
Pattern ranking 
An identified pattern is filtered out before ranking if the Hit/Seq ratio is larger than 2. After that, 
both the un-gapped and gapped patterns are collected together and then ranked according to three 
criteria. Our first one is the preferential occurrence of a pattern in G

 relative to G

, denoted by 
Sd. Let |G

| be the number of sequences in G

, and |G

| be the number of sequences in G

. The 
proportions of sequences in G

 and G

 that contain a pattern P are denoted as f and f, 
respectively. The one-tailed two-sample proportion test can be performed as follows:

than z10.01 are treated as non-significant and are removed before the ranking process. 
The second criterion of the ranking scheme is the pattern position score, named Sp, which is 
derived from the popularity of positions that the pattern matches. First, a nucleotide in the 
promoter sequences in G

 gets one point if it is hit by a non-wildcard of a pattern. In this way, 
similar patterns increase their scores respectively via the number of the nucleotides they 
simultaneously hit. Sp is calculated by summing these nucleotide scores, normalized by the 
number of non-wildcard nucleotides involved. Thus, Sp is formulated as:

The third criterion of the ranking scheme is the conservation score, Sc, which is the degree of 
evolutionary conservation among a set of orthologous sequences (excluding the species under 
study). For each pattern, the degree of conservation is assessed by the conservation of exact motif 
matches in S, where S is the set of all orthologous sequences of promoters in G

 that match the 
pattern. An alignment (ClustralW) of the promoter regions (500 bp, intergenic regions only) of 
the orthologues from Saccharomyces paradoxus, S. kudriavzevii, S. mikatae, and S. bayanus is 
constructed for each gene that matches the pattern of interest. A match to an orthologue is defined 
as that at least one match of the motif is found within the 3w bp region with respect to the hit 
positions in S. cerevisiae, where w is the length of the pattern. For a gapped motif, the length 
includes the wildcards in between two compact blocks.  
Finally, these three components are incorporated in the following equation to form the final 
pattern score: 
 Spattern = Sd  Sp
a
  Sc
b
 [4] 
, where a and b are the relative weights given to the position score and conservation score, and 
are empirically set to 1 and 2 (0). 
The ranked patterns are grouped into motif clusters by an incremental clustering process. 
The list of ranked patterns is examined from the top, and a pattern starts to form a new cluster if it 
is not similar (lower than 0.8) to any major form of the existing clusters. In each cluster, we 
consider the pattern with the best ranking (the highest Spattern) as the major form and the others as 
the minor forms of the motif. For similarity calculation, consensuses are first transformed into 
position frequency matrices (PFMs) based on the matched segments, and then similarity between 
pairs of PFMs is calculated (5, 21). The threshold 0.8 is chosen from the results of a validation set 
(see below). For each TF, we only consider the top ten (“top-10”) motif clusters for further 
analysis, and for each motif cluster, four minor forms are merged with the major form to 
construct the final PFM. After the PFM is constructed, the scores in Eq. 4, Sd, Sp, and Sc, are 
adjusted accordingly to reflect the fact of merging the major and minor consensus forms. In 
particular, the position score Sp is refined to consider only the rank property of input sequences, 
since the similar patterns are now merged into a single motif and their importance can be 
determined by the other two scores Sd and Sc. Finally, the top-10 motifs are re-ranked by Eq. 4 
with new scores to generate the final top-10 motif list.  
2.3 Results and Discussions 
Performance tests on validation data 
We first use 32 TFs with well studied motifs, collected in the MYBS database (44), as the 
validation set (0); this set includes nine gapped motifs. For each TF, we collect a positive set of 
promoter sequences (G) with a p value < 0.001 in the ChIP-chip data [31], and a negative set of 
promoter sequences (G) with p value > 0.9. The promoter sequences selected are defined as the 
500 bp intergenic region upstream of the start codon ATG. For the TFs for which our method 
16 
 
0 shows the results of our method on the validation set when parameters a and b are set at 
different values, which weight the influences of the position score and the conservation score, 
respectively, on the method. When a = 0 and b = 0, the patterns are selected simply according to 
their scores from the one-tailed two-sample proportion test. By setting „a = 1, b = 0‟ or „a = 0, b = 
1‟, position scores or conservation score are included. Including the conservation score 
consistently improves the prediction of both gapped and un-gapped motifs, while the position 
scoring scheme is particularly helpful for predicting gapped motifs. Several trial runs on the 
validation set suggest that „a = 1, b = 2‟ performs slightly better than „a = 1, b = 1‟ and „a = 1, b = 
3‟ (data not shown). 
Table 2.1 Performances of our method and some other motif finding methods in comparison to experimentally 
defined binding sites. In our method, weights a (for position score) and b (for conservation score) are set at different 
values. TFs with gapped motifs are shown in bold. The column „Sim.‟ lists the similarity of the predicted motif to the 
annotated PFM. Similarity scores (%) lower than 0.7 are considered failures and underlined.

Prediction of Additional TF Motifs 
We further select additional 54 TFs with experimentally annotated motifs (44), each of which has 
at least 15 target genes according to the ChIP-chip data (5). Eleven TFs (ARG81, ARO80, HAP3, 
HIR3, LEU3, NDD1, PPR1, PUT3, SIP4, STB4, and ZAP1) have been previously annotated as 
gapped motifs, while the others are un-gapped motifs. Our method predicts seven gapped motifs 
as the top-1 pattern and the other four correct patterns are, respectively, ranked top 2 (NDD1), top 
3 (PUT3), top 7 (HAP3) and top 8 (PPR1). For 30 of the 43 TFs with un-gapped motifs, the top-1 
pattern in our predictions is most similar to the known consensus and 8 TFs have a pattern similar 
to the annotated motif observed within the top-10 list.  
For the five failed cases, several observations can be made. The literature-annotated motif for 
the NDT80 binding site is CRCAAA, but there is only one occurrence of this motif in the 
promoter regions of the 18 NDT80 target genes identified by the ChIP-chip experiments. This 
may be because NDT80 plays a central role in regulating the progression through meiosis and 
sporulation, while the available ChIP-chip experiment was conducted in rich media. Similarly, 
only three out of 18 YAP3 targets contain the literature-annotated motif. Twenty-seven out of 31 
ADR1 target genes indeed contain occurrences of the literature defined binding motif 
(NGGRGK), but there are 4566 gene promoters in the yeast genome with at least one hit for the 
motif. Therefore, the frequency of this motif in the positive set was not significantly higher than 
that in the negative set, and so it would have been discarded during the mining process. A similar 
problem of low-complexity motifs is found for ROX1, as well as for MIG1 in the validation 
dataset. The YAP5 binding motif provides another interesting situation: a majority of its target 
genes reside in the subtelomeric regions of 12 yeast chromosomes and lack orthologues in the 
other four species. These targets are likely duplicate genes with highly similar coding and 
promoter regions, making it difficult to pick out the correct motif from among these highly 
similar promoters.  
2.4 Concluding Remarks 
We have developed a new method for discovering TFBSs, especially gapped motifs. Our 
method performs well when a good quality set of potential target genes of the TF under study is 
available. It uses a novel hybrid ranking system that considers not only preferential occurrence of 
the motif in a set of target promoters, but also the binding strength of a TF to a putative target 
promoter, the number of positions in the motif that are hit by similar motifs, and the degree of 
evolutionary conservation of a predicted TFBS. This system leads to a better performance than 
current methods. By using a validation dataset and different weighting schemes, we determine the 
relevant biological criteria to accurately evaluate and compile a large number of mined candidate 
motifs. Compared to previous studies, the derived motifs achieve high sensitivity and specificity 
for predicting experimentally verified TFBSs. Our study demonstrates that hybrid data mining

Chapter 3. Regulatory mechanism of neighboring genes 
3.1 Co-expression of adjacent genes in yeast can not be simply attributed to shared 
regulatory system 
3.1.1 Introduction 
The arrangement and orientation of genes in genomes is often shaped through evolution by 
mechanisms such as unequal crossing over followed by random genetic drift or natural selection 
(48-49). Recent studies indicate that the distribution of genes in genomes does not always happen 
at random (50-52). In the human genome, housekeeping genes show a strong tendency to cluster 
together (53), and genes that participate in the same pathway also tend to lie adjacent to each 
other in the genome (52, 54-55). Moreover, several studies indicate that adjacent genes in human 
seem to co-express regardless of their intergenic distance (56-58). Similar phenomena have been 
observed in Drosophila, nematode, and yeast (59-63). Among these observations, the 
co-expression of adjacent pairs is crucial because changes in such genome organization could 
alter the co-regulated transcription over the pairs (58-59).  
How co-expressed genes are regulated is still unclear. Two major mechanisms proposed are 
alterations of chromatin structure and sharing of the same regulatory elements (50, 52, 62). The 
open conformation of the chromatin structure is required for genes to be transcribed into RNAs 
and thus become expressed. A general hypothesis is that clusters of genes in the same chromatin 
domain have a higher chance to be expressed simultaneously than genes located in different 
chromatin domains (52, 64). Alternatively, cis-regulatory elements could behave like fine 
modules that alter gene expression locally. Therefore, adjacent pairs with  common upstream 
activation sites (UAS) or shared regulatory systems are more likely to be co-expressed (56, 59).  
Several attempts have been made to investigate the mechanism for co-expression of adjacent 
gene pairs. In human, the abundance of divergent pairs relative to convergent and tandem pairs 
has been reported (58), and the common CpG islands that were often found between divergent 
pairs were known to be associated with an “open” or “active” chromatin (58, 65-66). However, 
co-expressed groups of adjacent genes spanning 20-200 kilobases in the Drosophila genome did 
not show any correlation with known chromosomal structures (57, 63). Later, the idea of 
co-expression among clustered genes was rejected by Thygesen and Zwinderman (60), whose 
study also failed to discover any correlation between the chromatin domain and co-expressed 
genes in Drosophila. 
It is evident that in yeast adjacent gene pairs display stronger co-expression than random pairs 
do (67). Kruglyak and Tand (59) proposed that some co-expressed pairs resulted from sharing a 
single regulatory system, despite the fact that many genes controlled by separate regulatory 
systems may also have highly co-expressed patterns. Hurst et al. (56) also concluded that 
divergent orientation is dominant for co-regulation and for conservation of pairs, but the finding 
had weak statistical support. Although these studies suggested that the sharing of a common UAS 
plays an important role in regulating co-expressed pairs, and that divergent pairs are more likely 
22 
 
We considered an adjacent pair conserved if the neighboring ORFs were orthologues of 
adjacent genes in S. cerevisiae and meanwhile retained the same orientation pattern. If one (or 
both) genes of an adjacent pair in S. cerevisiae were missing or the pairing orientation was 
different in other species, the pair was ascribed to the non-conserved group. The conserved 
pairs were then classified into stringently conserved and loosely conserved groups according 
to their degree of conservation. An adjacent pair was considered stringently conserved if the 
adjacent relationship was preserved in all five yeast species. The loosely conserved group 
refers to the pairs that have an adjacent relationship preserved in any three of the five yeast 
species, or preserved in S. castellii and one another of the four yeast species. This is because 
that S. castellii is the most distantly related species among the five, and the chance of 
convergent evolution is remote. As a result, there were 345 stringently conserved pairs and 
3,582 loosely conserved pairs. Among those, there were 94, 95, and 156 stringently conserved 
pairs and 942, 973, and 1,667 loosely conserved pairs for the divergent, convergent, and 
tandem categories, respectively. 
To compare the preserved patterns among these five yeast species, the relative ratios of 
three adjacent patterns were analyzed by chi-square test using a random sampling as reference 
(0.25 : 0.25 : 0.5) (Table 3.1). 
Evaluation of the expression correlation between conserved adjacent pairs 
We selected four S. cerevisiae microarray datasets for the expression analysis, including alpha 
(70), cdc (70), crz1p (71), and env (72). Both the alpha and cdc datasets are time course 
expression profiles encompassing two to three cell cycles after release from growth arrest. The 
alpha data were obtained from cells treated with alpha-factor transiently, and the cdc data was 
collected from a cdc15-2 temperature sensitive mutant which resumed growth after release 
from heat shock. For the crz1p dataset, yeast cells were triggered for ionic signaling by either 
calcium (Ca
2+
) or sodium (Na
+
). The env dataset contains expression profiles of yeast cells 
exposed to diverse environmental perturbations. Each array was normalized so that the log 
ratios had a mean of zero. To avoid potential discrepancy between arrays due to factors 
specific to each condition, we merged these four array data into one large dataset and used the 
Pearson coefficient to calculate the co-expression level for each adjacent pair.  
To investigate whether conserved adjacent pairs had a higher tendency to be co-expressed, 
we compared for the conserved group the expression correlations of divergent pairs, 
convergent pairs, and tandem pairs to those of a group of 5,000 non-adjacent random pairs. 
We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to examine whether two groups of gene pairs 
were co-expressed to different extents. The KS test is a nonparametric test which determines if 
two distributions differ significantly. The KS test calculates the maximum vertical deviation 
(D) between the empirical distribution functions of the two groups to determine whether the 
two datasets are drawn from the same distribution. Let x be the expression correlation of an 
ORF pair over all experimental points. Let fi(x) be the density function of x for the gene pairs 
in group i, and Fi(x) be the function of corresponding cumulative distribution. For groups i and

3.1.3 Results 
Conservation of adjacent pairs in five yeast species 
In order to investigate the conservation of adjacent pairs during the evolution of yeast, we 
collected S. cerevisiae orthologues from four Saccharomyces sensu stricto species (Table 3.1). 
In all cases, the proportions of conservation for different adjacent patterns (i.e. divergent pairs, 
convergent pairs and tandem pairs) were similar to those for random sampling composition (p 
> 0.05, chi-square test), suggesting that the three adjacent patterns have equal chances to be 
preserved. In more detailed analysis of stringently conserved pairs (definitions in Methods), 
we found that only a small fraction of adjacent pairs had maintained their particular adjacency 
relationships across these species. The conservation ratios are relatively low compared to those 
of the adjacent pairs found in S. cerevisiae (94/1491 for divergent pairs, 95/1474 for 
convergent pairs, and 156/2737 for tandem pairs) (Table 3.1). The low preservation ratios 
indicate that the adjacent relationship is not tightly maintained during the course of yeast 
evolution.  
Co-expression of conserved adjacent pairs  
As shown in Fig. 3.1A, all three pairing types of stringently conserved pairs have significant 
levels of co-expression compared to that of random pairs (p < 0.0001, KS test). However, 
there is no obvious difference in co-expression levels between the three adjacent patterns (p > 
0.01, KS test). In particular the divergent pairs did not show a higher co-expression as 
expected. On the contrary, in comparing the expression dataset of loosely conserved pairs, 
convergent and divergent pairs displayed higher co-expression levels than did tandem pairs 
with statistical support (p < 0.0001, KS test) (Fig. 3.1B).

We acknowledge the potential bias and noise that microarray data may bear. To circumvent 
this problem, we also analyzed the condition-specific datasets separately (see Fig. 3.1, 3.2 and 
3.3) and obtained observations similar to those using the merged dataset. 
The co-expression of PAC- and RRPE-regulated divergent pairs 
Since the proportion of adjacent pairs sharing TFs is low as aforementioned, it is important to 
inquire whether the shared TFs in divergent pairs are more likely to co-regulate the divergent 
genes. We present a case here to illustrate the effects of sharing regulatory system on 
co-expression. Beer and Tavazoie studied two computationally discovered sequence elements, 
PAC (polymerase A and C) and RRPE (rRNA processing element), which are considered to 
have combinatorial regulations on their target genes (17). The authors found very similar 
expression patterns among genes with PAC located within 140bp and RRPE within 240bp of 
the ATG start codon, respectively.

3.1.4 Discussion 
Low conservation ratio of adjacent pairs in five yeast species 
We compared the adjacency relationships of gene pairs among five yeast species which had 
undergone WGD and found random distribution for all three adjacent patterns. The evidence 
supported the hypothesis that the selection on types of adjacency along the S. cerevisiae 
lineage was neutral after WGD (68). This neutrality also explained our observation of a low 
proportion of conserved adjacent pairs in five yeast species (e.g. 5.7~6.45% for the stringently 
conserved group). Similar results were found in orthologous gene pairs between the S. 
cerevisiae and C. albicans genomes which had diverged before WGD (56). Since adjacent 
pairs have a tendency to co-express in yeast (67), observations from these studies contradict 
the hypothesis that adjacent pairs with co-expression patterns are more likely to maintain the 
adjacent relationship during evolution (51, 58, 69). This implied that co-expression of adjacent 
pairs may be due to other mechanisms such as chromatin opening.  
In contrast to yeast, a higher proportion of conserved adjacent pairs were observed in the 
genomes of mammalian lineage (58, 69). It is possible that the selection strength and/or 
mechanism over adjacency is different in yeast than in human (58, 69). It is also interesting to 
note that the ratios of conserved divergent, convergent, and tandem pairs are similar. This 
leads to the conclusion that for yeast divergent relationship is not appreciably favored by 
selection, even though these pairs are more likely to share a regulatory system and thus are 
more likely to display co-expression. Importantly, this notion is also different from that drawn 
from the vertebrate genomes, in which the conservation ratio of divergent pairs is higher than 
that of tandem pairs, suggesting a negative selection on the separation of divergent pairs 
during evolution of vertebrates (51).  
It is proposed that the conservation of divergent pairs in human has functional importance. 
This hypothesis is supported by the significant expression correlation and functional 
association among divergent pairs (51, 57-58, 69). Although several cases in yeast have shown 
functional associations for conserved divergent pairs (55, 59), a higher co-expression level in 
divergent pairs could not be detected when compared to tandem pairs (67). Consistent with 
this finding, we found no difference in the co-expression level among three adjacency patterns 
for the stringently conserved group, supporting the observation of neutrality in adjacency types. 
In addition, we found the co-expression levels of conserved adjacent pairs and non-conserved 
adjacent pairs to be approximately the same in yeast, indicating that the adjacent relationship 
of co-expressed pairs is free from selection constraint in yeast. It seems that a bias toward 
divergent gene organization is only observed in the lineage leading to mammals (69). If this is 
true, a possible explanation is that the mechanisms concerning the co-expression of adjacent 
pairs in yeast are different from those in mammals. For example, mechanisms such as sharing 
of cis-regulatory elements and antisense transcription, both of which explained the 
co-expression of human adjacent genes (52, 74), are actually rare in yeast genome (75-76).

sophisticated regulatory system which integrates both TF-based and non-TF based mechanisms(s), 
of which the latter may account for a greater extent in driving co-expression of neighboring genes. 
This integrative regulatory system allows yeasts to simultaneously modulate expression of 
neighboring genes in order to adapt to changing environments rapidly and efficiently. 
3.2 Co-Expression of Neighboring Genes in the Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Genome 
3.2.1 Introduction 
The distribution of genes in eukaryotic genomes was long believed to be random; however, recent 
studies have indicated that this is not always the case (50-52). For example, in the human genome, 
housekeeping genes show a strong tendency to cluster together (53), and genes that participate on 
the same pathway also tend to lie adjacent to each other in the genome (52, 54-55). Moreover, 
several studies indicate that adjacent genes in humans seem to co-express, regardless of their 
intergenic distance (56-58). Similar phenomena have been observed in Drosophila, nematodes, 
and yeast (59-63). Among these observations, the co-expression of adjacent pairs is crucial because 
changes in the genome‟s organization could alter the co-regulated transcription of the pairs 
(58-59). 
The mechanism responsible for the co-expression of adjacent genes is not well understood (52, 
79). It has been noted that sharing the regulatory system cannot fully explain the co-expression of 
adjacent genes (80). Therefore, investigation of neighboring genes may provide information that 
will help researchers better understand the gene co-expression mechanism. Recently, based on 
Pearson‟s correlation coefficient (R) values, co-expressions of neighboring genes have been 
investigated using sliding windows of a certain sequence length (the number of nucleotides) (53) or 
a given number of genes (63, 81-82). Cohen et al. [19] found that yeast genes of neighboring gene 
triplets display similar expression patterns, while Spellman and Rubin [13] reported that more than 
20% of the genes in the Drosophila genome are clustered into co-regulated groups of 10-30 genes. 
In nematodes, many neighboring gene pairs within a distance range of 20 kbp show correlated 
expressions (81); and co-expression of neighboring genes has even been observed in plants, such as 
Arabidopsis (83-84). However, in zebrafish (Danio rerio), which is characterized by a compact 
genome (85), the co-expression tendency of neighboring genes has yet to be investigated. 
Therefore, in the following, we attempt to fill this research gap. 
To investigate whether co-expressed clusters of genes exist in zebrafish, we first examined 
theco-expression levels among three neighboring gene patterns, namely pairs, triplets and 
quadruplets. Studying the co-expression of neighboring genes is of particular interest because it is 
believed that the zebrafish genome may contain about 30% more genes than the human genome, 
and an additional round of genome duplication occurred about 450 million years ago (86). Thus, 
in theory, the duplicated neighboring relationships in zebrafish should be free from evolutionary 
selection. Recent advances in technology have led to the establishment of databases of whole 
genome sequences, genomic mapping data with physical distances, and microarray expression 
profiles. These tools allow researchers to investigate the co-expression mechanism of neighboring 
genes by studying their proximity and the physical distance between them. In this project, we 
investigated whether the co-expressed clusters are associated with the physical distance of the 
32 
 
windows of 2, 3 and 4 genes respectively) (63) to the expression correlations of a group of 
10,000 non-adjacent random pairs. The gene order was determined using the 6,444 genes 
derived from the genomic mapping and expression datasets. In addition to adjacent pairs, the 
Pearson coefficient values for triplets and quadruplets were determined by calculating the 
expression profiles of the first gene and the last gene of a group. This contrasts with the method 
used by Ren et al. (83) who took the average of all pairwise Pearson coefficients, and therefore 
might have overrepresented the co-expression level. We used the Pearson correlation values of 
the three neighboring gene patterns (i.e., pairs, triplets, and quadruplets) and random pairs to 
construct their individual cumulative distributions. Then, based on the respective distributions, 
we used the one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to determine whether two groups of gene 
pairs co-expressed to different extents. For example, to test whether the distribution of pairs and 
the distribution of triplets differed significantly, we compared H0 : Fpairs = Ftriplets with H1 : Fpairs 
< Ftriplets using the one-sided KS test, where F denotes the cumulative distribution function of 
the Pearson coefficients of a gene expression pattern. If H0 was rejected, Fpairs < Ftriplets, which 
meant the Pearson coefficients in a group of pairs were „stochastically greater‟ than those in a 
group of triplets. 
Identification of Local Co-Expression Levels 
To investigate the correlation between the co-expression level and the physical distance of 
neighboring genes, we compared the expression correlations of genes within certain distances 
(50 kbp, 100 kbp, 300 kbp, and 500 kbp sliding windows) (53) to the expression correlations of 
a group of 10,000 non-adjacent random pairs. We then used the one-sided 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to examine whether two groups of gene pairs co-expressed to 
different extents based on their cumulative distribution of Pearson coefficients. We define the 
gene distance as the distance between the TLS of the first gene and the TLS of the last gene in 
the group. 
Determination of Tandem Repeat Genes 
To eliminate the possibility of co-expression bias caused by tandem repeat genes, we separated 
such genes for analysis. We considered a gene pair as a tandemly repeated gene if the local 
pairwise protein BLASTP yielded E < 2 × 10
-1
 (53, 62, 81-82). This criterion is based on the 
identification of human duplicated genes. The pairwise search which is used to identify human 
duplicated genes successfully removed about 90% of the related genes in the human population 
(53, 82). 
3.2.3 Results and Discussion  
Co-Expression of Neighboring Gene Pairs 
To investigate the co-expression of neighboring genes, we combined the NCBI annotation of the 
zebrafish genome and thirteen microarray datasets from ArrayExpress (87). Of the 6,444 genes 
with expression values and their relative positions in the zebrafish genome, we found that only a 
small fraction of the gene pairs exhibited significant co-expression levels. Specifically, the 
proportions were 0.67% for adjacent pairs, 0.48% for triplets, and 0.24% for quadruplets, as

The Physical Distance between Genes in the Local Co-Expression Domain 
Since the co-expression level of neighboring genes in a small domain is significantly higher than 
that of the random samples, it would be interesting to investigate whether the co-expression 
level is related to the physical distance between neighboring genes. First, our calculations 
showed that the mean TLS (translation start site) distances between highly co-expressed 
neighboring genes (i.e., adjacent pairs, triplets and quadruplets) were remarkably shorter than 
those of all neighboring genes in the zebrafish genome. The mean distance of highly 
co-expressed genes differed by 186 kbp (208 kbp versus 394 kbp) compared to that of all 
neighboring genes, as shown in Table 3.4. Thus, the results suggest that, since co-expressed 
neighboring genes are more tightly clustered within the genome, the proximity of highly 
co-expressed neighboring genes may be an important factor in their co-expression. 
Second, we also investigated the co-expression tendency of neighboring genes with various 
physical distances in the chromosomes. The sizes of the neighboring genes were identified using 
50 kbp, 100 kbp, 300 kbp and 500 kbp sliding windows (see Section 3.2.3 for details). As shown 
in Figure 3.6, the co-expressions of four groups, 50 kbp (1699 pairs), 100 kbp (2987 pairs), 300 
kbp (4945 pairs) and 500 kbp (5683 pairs) exhibit significantly higher co-expression levels 
compared to those of random pairs (p<0.01, one-sided KS test). The statistical results in Figure 
3.6 also indicate a negative correlation between co-expression and distance, which implies that 
the physical distance between co-expressed pairs in a chromosome may have an effect on the 
co-expression level.

 Characterization of Adjacent Gene Pairs 
Since most adjacent pairs are co-expressed, we hypothesize that the genetic distance between 
adjacent pairs might be a contributory factor to their higher co-expression levels. To 
characterize the structural features of adjacent gene pairs, we compared the distributions of the 
TLS distances between adjacent pairs with highly correlated expressions (R>0.7) and those with 
lowly correlated expressions (R<0.2). Figure 3.8 shows that the TLS distance of the majority 
(81.40%) of highly co-expressed adjacent gene pairs is less than 50 kbp, and the distribution 
drops sharply as the distance increases. A statistical test (the Chi square-test, p<0.001) showed 
that the distributions of the highly co-expressed group were significantly different from those of 
the lowly co-expressed group. Hence, it might be inferred that gene pairs with a shorter distance 
have a higher co-expression tendency.

value >0.7) and lowly co-expressed adjacent gene pairs (Pearson correlation value <0.2).

genes, and consequently, the co-expressed gene pairs have retained their neighboring 
relationships through evolution. A similar phenomenon has been observed in other vertebrates 
(50, 53, 88), and also in plants, such as Arabidopsis (83). Moreover, in zebrafish, we found that 
the proportion of highly co-expressed adjacent pairs (R value >0.7) is higher than the proportion 
of co-expressed gene pairs in triplets and quadruplets. Based on the hypothesis that the close 
proximity of neighboring genes could lead to the sharing of cis-regulatory elements (82, 89), it 
is likely that such sharing could partially explain gene co-expression behavior in zebrafish. 
Two key mechanisms explain the co-expression of neighboring genes: alteration of the 
chromatin structure and sharing of regulatory elements (50, 52, 62). Our analysis demonstrates 
that genes in close proximity in a chromosome have a stronger tendency to co-express than 
genes that are farther apart. This finding further supports the hypothesis that the shorter the 
physical distance between two genes, the higher the probability that the genes will share 
cis-regulatory elements and result in their co-expression (82-83). This hypothesis is also 
supported by the work of Fukuoka et al. (62), who found that the co-expression levels of genes 
correlate strongly with the physical distance between the genes rather than with the adjacency of 
the genes. However, Spellman and Rubin (63) suggested otherwise. In their study, the pattern of 
gene expression within a neighborhood is independent of the physical distance between gene 
pairs. Moreover, studies of human genes have shown that co-expression between adjacent genes 
is not related to their physical distance (56-58). Nevertheless, more direct evidence is required to 
determine the mechanisms that govern the co-expression of neighboring genes (77, 79). 
In the zebrafish genome, we found that, on average, highly co-expressed neighboring genes 
(R>0.7) were much closer to each other than the neighboring genes that did not exhibit 
co-expression. This finding suggests that the physical distance between gene pairs is an 
important factor in their co-expression behavior. The phenomenon of co-expressed clusters has 
also been observed in other organisms. For example, in the yeast genome, Lercher and Hurst (90) 
found clusters of local co-expression ranging up to 30 genes (100 kbp); and in the Arabidopsis 
genome, there are local clusters of up to 20 genes that co-express, with an overall median cluster 
size of 100 kbp (82). Higher co-expression clusters ranging up to 200 kbp have also been found 
in the Drosophia genome (63). Surprisingly, the highly co-expressed neighboring genes in 
zebrafish span a larger distance than other model organisms studied (63, 67, 77, 84). Although 
the reason for this difference is still not clear, our observations suggest that chromatin 
modifications might contribute to co-expression behavior because multigenic loci within an 
acetylated chromatin can be commonly regulated (91-92). 
By using sliding windows up to 500 kbp in size, the significance of co-expressed clusters can 
be observed in the zebrafish genome. Similarly, in the Drosophila genome, 10 to 30 
co-expressed genes can be found in clusters by using a 20~200 kbp sliding window (63). The 
same pattern is also observed in C. elegans. After removing duplicate genes, the significant 
clusters of co-expressed genes are restricted to distances within 20 kbp (81). It has been 
suggested that co-expressed gene clusters that span long distances are consistent with the 
boundaries of the chromatin structure (93-94). A recent study also observed that radial 
chromatin positioning is preferentially shaped by the local gene density (91). Since the genes

16th ISMB 會議報告 
報告人： 蔡懷寬 
 
本人於 2008 年七月十九日至八月七日，在國家科學委員會
(NSC96-2221-E-001-022-MY2)的資助下，前往加拿大多倫多參加重要
的生物資訊國際會議『 16th Annual International Conference on 
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)』，並於會後前往美
國卡內基美濃大學，與之前任職於本研究室助理黃子瑋（目前為該校
之博士班學生）會面，將之前國科會研究計畫「Simultaneous 
Identification for Synergistic Transcription Factors and Their 
Transcription Factor Binding Sites」做所有資料之彙整並將結果投稿至
國際期刊。 
ISMB 是生物資訊學中幾個最重要的國際會議之一，今年會議有
來自數十個國家，近一千六百名學者與會，一共發表近四十八篇的重
要文章和近千篇的 poster papers，國內亦有十餘位學者參加並發表文
章。其中另有六十個 Highlight Track文章，大多數上台報告的學者，
其內容多半是已經在有名的期刊發表或是審核中，讓我可以在第一時
間內得到許多第一手的研究結果。此外也有十數個生物資訊應用系統
作用研究之專家。本論文在發展過程中，發現蛋白質結合位置的某些
特定位置與其他蛋白質有很強烈的相關性，我們研究團隊原先一直認
為是因為其他蛋白質因為與其交互作用而造成 binding affinity的改變
或是改變其原先構型。然而，在討論的過程中，Sarai 博士認為我們
發現的現象也有可能是來自於 DNA折疊的角度改變所造成。這提供
了我們很多另外的思維，可以做更進一步的驗證。同時我們在一起討
論時，也遇見德國一位博士班學生Malk Friedel，他實作出一個可以
計算 DNA在不同條件下的折疊角度，剛好可以用來對我們的結果作
進一步分析。這樣的腦力激盪確實使我們的研究跨進一大步，可謂收
穫良多！ 
此外，在會議過程中，同時也與其他的 posters展示人員討論生物
資訊相關研究議題，了解他們所解決的課題與目前所遇到的障礙，及
可能的解決辦法還有未來研究之方向等。其中有一篇壁報 Inferring 
pathway activity toward precise disease classification（圖二），為
Eunjung Lee、Han-Yu Chuang以及 Trey Ideker所發表，特別引發我的
興趣，因為這些研究學者來自於不同的國家，但卻可以透過網路而做
出傑出的研究，像這樣跨國合作的經驗與方式，相當值得我們借鏡。
在會議的最後，該壁報也獲選為 outstanding poster award – sponosred 
by the sudarsky center for computational biology。
