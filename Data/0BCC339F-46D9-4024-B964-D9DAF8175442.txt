larger size. However, the connectivity between the various levels of pores is vital to 
maximise the benefits of hierarchy in catalysed reactions. Structured zeolitic frameworks 
with hierarchical porosity [1–10] are gaining attention due to their potential impact in 
catalysis, adsorption/separation, molecular recognition, electronics and biomaterials [1-8]. 
A variety of approaches for preparing hierarchical zeolites have been earlier 
reported, direct synthesis, different post synthesis treatments and finally, novel dual 
templating method [11-14]. Crystallization of zeolite inside porous template (polymer), 
leading to zeolite template composite. Upon calcinations, the template composite is 
transferred to solely zeolitic material that retains the morphological features of the 
template.  
Tert-butylated phenols which are conventionally prepared by reacting phenol 
with pure isobutylene gas or C4 fraction of naphtha and using a liquid acid catalyst, 
give wide product distribution. 2-tert-butylphenol is an intermediate for pesticides, 
fragrances and other products whereas 4-tert-butylphenol is used to make phosphate 
esters, fragrances, oil field chemicals and demulsifiers. 2, 4-ditert-butylphenol is an 
intermediate for antioxidants and 2, 6 di-tert-butylphenol is used as an antioxidant 
intermediate and in pharmaceuticals [15, 16]. Although many commercial ion exchange 
resins exhibits high activity for the tert-butylation of phenol and substituted phenols 
with isobutylene, their lower thermal stability limit their industrial application [17, 18, 
and 19].  
The Friedel-Crafts acylation is a key step in the manufacture of aromatic 
ketones used as intermediates for the production of pharmaceuticals, dyes, 
agrochemicals and fragrances [19-20]. Conventionally, the method used to prepare 
aromatic ketones is the acylation of aromatics with activated derivatives of carboxylic 
acids, such as acid halides and anhydrides, in presence of soluble Lewis acids such as 
AlCl3, FeCl3 or ZnCl2 as catalysts [21]. These catalysts pose considerable problems 
such as toxicity, potential danger in handling, disposal problems due to large amount of 
acidic effluents, and difficulties in product isolation. Solid acid catalysts have been 
Aluminium isopropoxide (AIP), Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), 
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 40% aq), anisole, tert-butanol, phenol and 
phenyl acetate were commercial samples from Merck and were used without further 
purification. Natural Rubber latex and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) were purchased 
from Apar Industries, India. 
2.2 Preparation of hierarchical ZSM-5 nanozeolite using NR 
In the present work we demonstrate the fabrication of hierarchical ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 
100) material using dual template approach under controlled steaming at 150˚C. 
Tetrapropylammoniumhydroxide (TPAOH) was used as a structure directing agent and 
natural rubber (NR) latex particles was used as macro pore template. At first, a clear 
solution of zeolite was prepared by mixing 6.34 g of tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide 
(TPAOH) and Aluminium isopropoxide (AIP) and to the clear solution, 10.4 g of 
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), and 15 g of water were added with stirring for 2 hrs. The 
above solution was concentrated at 60˚C at a low pressure of about 700 mm Hg for 30 
minutes. To the concentrated solution 0.3 g of NR latex solid content was added and 
dried at room temperature. The sample was steamed at 150˚C for 6 hrs and calcined at 
550˚C for 6 hrs. The obtained hierarchical ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 100) zeolite material was 
subjected to the following analysis. 
2.3. Preparation of hierarchical nanozeolite silicalite-1 
Tetrapropylammoniumhydroxide (TPAOH) was used as a structure directing agent 
and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) latex particles was used as macro pore template. At 
first, a clear solution of zeolite was prepared by mixing 6.34g of tetrapropyl ammonium 
hydroxide (TPAOH), 10.4g of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), and 15g of water with 
stirring for 2 hrs. The molar composition of the final solution was 1 SiO2/ 4 EtOH / 0.25 
TPAOH/ 20 H2O. The pH of the final solution was 11.49. The clear sol was concentrated 
in a rotary evaporator at 80 C as described in the literature [16]. The concentrated sol 
obtained had a H2O/ SiO2 molar ratio of 3.46. The above solution was aged at 80˚C for 
18hrs. The sample heated up to 18 h showed a very faint bluish shade, indicating the

instrument. Nitrogen adsorption measurements were carriedout at 77.4 K on a 
Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument.The spectra were recorded with a resolution of 2 
cm

 from 400 to 4000 cm

 and corrected for background. Morphology and particles size 
distribution of the zeolite nanocrystals were examined with a field emission scanning 
electron microscope (FESEM) using a JEOL SM-6500F instrument.  Transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out using a TEM JEOL-2100 instrument. 
3. Results and discussion 
The ZSM-5 structure prepared using NR as a structure directing agent is characterized 
as follows.  
3.1 Structure and microstructure analyses 
The XRD pattern of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 1) indicates that highly 
crystallized ZSM-5 zeolite is formed without any impurities, as no additional peaks were 
observed. The characteristic peaks show a typical MFI -type structure. Compared to the 
diffraction patterns of micrometer-sized zeolite, the diffraction peaks are broadened, an 
indication of the formation of nano-sized particles, which was confirmed later by TEM 
analysis. 
 Adsorption/desorption isotherm of the calcined sample (Fig. 3) shows little 
increase until P0, suggesting the presence of both mesopores and macropores. An upward 
rise in curve of the isotherm indicated filling of interparticle spaces between the 
nanocrystals showed the mesoporous nature of the material [16]. The external surface 
areas determined from t-plot was 478 m

 The hierarchical slicalite-1 material after calcination was analyzed through 
Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy. It is very clear 
from the SEM picture that, the zeolite mixed with SBR (Figure 3a) produced long-range 
macropore order material. Figure 3b shows the transmission electron microscopy of 
synthesized hierarchical slicalite-1. The average particle size was found to be around 100

2.4. Catalytic reaction and product analysis 
The tert-butylation of phenol was carried out in a 100 ml stainless steel Parr 
autoclave. Typical experiment consisted of 0.1 mol phenol, 0.2 mol tert-butanol, and a 
catalyst weight of 0.03 g/cm
3
 of liquid at 150 ˚C for 3 h. Analysis of the samples was 
done using a Gas Chromatograph (China Chromatography 8900), with 10 % OV-17 
column with nitrogen as the carrier gas. Product identification was done by comparison 
with authentic (standard) samples as well as by a combined gas chromatography–mass 
spectrometry. The conversion rate (in %) is expressed as the percentage of phenol 
converted into the alkylated product. 
 
Acylation of anisole with acetic anhydride was studied systematically using 
hierarchical ZSM-5 as a catalyst. In the first step the influence of reaction time on 
the conversion was studied using the catalyst hierarchical ZSM-5. It was found that the 
conversion first increases with increasing reaction time but remains 
practicallyconstant after 70 min. Hence all further experiments were carried out for 70 
min. The acylation of anisole over hierarchical ZSM-5 leads to the formation of 
4-methoxyacetophenone, which is 99.5 % and the other 0.5 % is 
2-methoxyacetophenone (Scheme 1). The conversion is expressed as the percentage 
of acetic anhydride converted into acylated product. The reaction parameters such 
as,catalyst quantity, anisole to acetic anhydride mole ratio, reaction temperature were 
studied.The Beckmann rearrangement reactions were carried out using a tubular 
down -flow reactor ((i.d. 15 mm and length 300 mm) at atmospheric pressure. About 1 g 
of catalyst was charged to the reactor, packed in a layer of ceramic wool and supported 
by glass beads. The reactor was heated to the reaction temperature with the help of a

phenol increases, which is due to the proportional increase in the number of active sites 
then becomes less significant beyond 0.03 g/cm
3
, see Table 1. This indicates that beyond 
0.03 g/cm
3
, the additional active sites have no direct effect anymore on the adsorption of 
reactants at a given concentration therefore the conversion of phenol becomes almost 
steady. Hence all further experiments were carried out using 0.03 g/cm
3
 of catalysts.

. Effect of mole ratio 
The effect of phenol to tert-butyl alcohol mole ratio was studied at 1 to 3 by 
keeping the total volume constant (Table 2). The conversion of phenol was found to 
increase with increasing the concentration of tert-butyl alcohol up to 2 and thereafter 
remained constant. Further increase in molar ratio has no appreciable effect in phenol 
conversion. Therefore, all reactions were studied by using a phenol to tert-butyl alcohol 
mole ratio of 1:2.

Effect of reaction temperature 
The effect of temperature on the conversion of phenol was studied over a range of 
90-180C (Table 3). The conversion was found to increase significantly with increasing 
temperature till 150C and thereafter remained constant. Therefore for further study the 
reaction temperature was fixed at 150C.

Comparisons of catalytic activity 
The catalytic performance of phenol with tert-butanol over nanocrystalline 
hierarchical ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 100) catalysts is compared with literature values on the 
alkylation of phenol with tert-butanol over conventional ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 51.8) and 
hierarchical ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 52.6) catalysts [15]. As shown in Table 4, the catalytic 
activity over nanocrystalline hierarchical ZSM-5 obtained in this work corresponds to a 
phenol conversion of 83.8 % which is far higher than that of the conventional ZSM-5 and 
hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts. Although the conventional ZSM-5 and hierarchical ZSM-5 
catalysts possess higher acidity than that of the nanocrystalline hierarchical ZSM-5 
catalysts, the high activity is attributed to the presence of the hierarchical porosity and the 
nano-sized ZSM-5 catalyst particles. In addition, a small amount of bulky 2, 4, 6-tri-TBP

Acylation of anisole 
Acylation of anisole with acetic anhydride was studied systematically using hierarchical 
ZSM-5 as a catalyst. In the first step the influence of reaction time on the conversion was 
studied using the catalyst hierarchical ZSM-5. It was found that the conversion first 
increases with increasing reaction time but remains practically constant after 70 min. 
Hence all further experiments were carried out for 70 min. The acylation of anisole over 
hierarchical ZSM-5 leads to the formation of 4-methoxyacetophenone, which is 99.5 % 
and the other 0.5 % is 2-methoxyacetophenone (Scheme 1). The conversion is expressed 
as the percentage of acetic anhydride converted into acylated product. The reaction 
parameters such as, catalyst quantity, anisole to acetic anhydride mole ratio, reaction 
temperature were studied.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
acetic anhydride increased from 51.5 to 65%, as the mole ratio of anisole increased from 
1:1 to 5:1 (Figure 3.9). The increasing conversion of acetic anhydride is attributed to the 
easy desorption of acetic acid and 4-methoxyacetophenone formed through the zeolite 
pores by the excess anisole as anisole is a self-solvent [29]. All further experiments were 
carried out at anisole to acetic anhydride mole ratio of 5:1.

Figure 3.10 Effect of catalyst quantity on the conversion. 
The effect of catalyst quantity was studied over a range of 0.1 g to 0.4 g at 50C and 
anisole to acetic anhydride mole ratio of 5:1. Figure 3.10 shows the effect of catalyst 
quantity on the conversion of acetic anhydride. The conversion increases considerably 
with an increase in catalyst loading from 0.1 to 0.2 g and with further increase in the 
catalyst quantity from 0.2 to 0.4 g the conversion increases slightly. Hence all further 
experiments were carried out using 0.2 g catalyst.   
 
 
 
Cyclohexenone, 5-Cyanopentene and Cyanopentane. The effect of time-on-stream (TOS) 
and reaction temperature on the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime and ε-caprolactam 
selectivity were investigated over hierarchical silicalite-1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4 shows the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime over hierarchical silicalite-
1 at a reaction temperature of 275 C and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2.1 
hrs
-1
 as a function of time-on-stream. The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime remained 
nearly constant after 2 hrs. Hence, data were collected at a TOS of 2 hrs during further 
studies.

Ac2O conversion. The higher activity of hierarchical ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 100) is probably 
due to the hierarchical porosity and the smaller size of ZSM-5 catalyst particles.  
We have established a simple and re-producible procedure for the fabrication of 
hierarchical silicalite-1 catalyst. The silicalite-1 consists of nanosized zeolite crystals 
aggregated in such a way hierarchical pores are formed. This study has demonstrated that 
hierarchical silicalite-1 was found to be highly active for the selective production of ε-
caprolactam. Hierarchical silicalite-1 show high selectivity typically above 95% to ε-
caprolactam combined with a high conversion (about 100 %) in the Beckmann 
rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. The high activity is attributed to the hierarchical 
porosity and the nano size of silicalite-1 catalyst particle.
