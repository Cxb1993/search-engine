corresponding local maximum should be degraded such that they have little change to be detected 
as a local  maximum in the second phase.  This  is  the main idea of this  research proposal.  The 
repeatability (the rate that the same features appear in two images of the same scene) of a feature 
detector is very crucial to feature-based watermarking because the detector acts as a synchronizer 
between the two processes of detection. If the repeatability is low, the system would not be able to 
recover the correct locations of watermarks and the watermark extraction would fail. With such an 
observation, this research proposes to develop a novel feature-based watermarking technique. First, 
existent  feature  detectors  will  be  investigated  thoroughly.  This  requires  extensive  information 
gathering,  study,  implementation,  experiments,  and  evaluations  of  various  feature  detectors. 
Decisions  will  be  made  among  using  existent  feature  detectors,  modifying  existing  feature 
detectors,  or  designing  new and better  detectors.  And then,  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the 
feature detectors, mathematical models will be developed for feature enhancement or degrading. 
The idea is to link feature enhancement/degrading with the characteristics of the feature detector 
with the hope that the feature detector will become more stable. Most of researches simply select 
the most appropriate feature detector, and then concentrate on watermark embedding and extraction 
designs.  We  argue  that  in  order  to  increase  the  performance  of  a  watermarking  system,  it  is 
necessary  to  consider  feature  detection  and  watermark  embedding/extraction  all  at  once.  And 
finally,  a  novel  watermark  embedding algorithm will  be developed based  on the results  of  the 
previous analysis.
