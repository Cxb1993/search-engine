CoBr2 -MnBr2 containing catalysts for catalytic oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid  
Published in Applied Catalysis, A: General 340(2008)271-277(請見附件二) 
1. Introduction 
Transition metal - catalyzed autoxidation of p-xylene  (PX) to terephthalic acid (TA) is one of 
the largest industrial-scale applications of homogeneous catalysis [1]. Purified terephthalic acid  
(PTA) is the ninth largest industrial chemical [2], which is used as raw material for the production 
of saturated polyester – mainly polyethylene terephthalate (abbreviated as PET) [3].  
Most of PTA used worldwide is manufactured by the Amoco Mid-Century (MC) method, which 
uses a catalyst consisting of cobalt acetate Co(OAc)2 , manganese acetate Mn(OAc)2  and 
hydrobromic acid (HBr) [2,4,5]. The Amoco process is operated at high temperature (175-225 oC ) 
and pressure (15-30 atm) of air in an acetic acid medium [6]. Solutions of HBr are highly 
corrosive, are very dangerous to handle and are highly harmful to the environment. It is highly 
desired to eliminate HBr in the TA production process. CoBr2 and MnBr2 have lower corrosion 
characteristics than HBr [7].  However, no scientific literature has reported the catalytic 
performances of CoBr2 /MnBr2 - containing catalysts for PX oxidation to TA. Kamiya et al. [8] 
briefly compared the performances of CoBr2 alone (without the addition of MnBr2) and 
NaBr-cobalt decanoate for p-xylene oxidation in a glass reactor (operated at low reaction 
pressure), and found that CoBr2  alone showed a very pronounced induction period at high 
catalyst concentration. The data presented by Kamiya et al. were mainly obtained with 
NaBr-cobalt decanoate system. 
This paper deals with the use of CoBr2 and MnBr2 as the bromine sources for  p-xylene 
oxidation to terephthalic acid. As mentioned above [7], CoBr2/MnBr2  - containing catalyst is 
less corrosive than HBr - containing catalyst. In addition, the catalyst system studied here is 
easier to be recovered than Co/Mn/Br catalysts containing NaBr [8,9] or other metal compounds 
[4] because the former contains no other metal ions.  
We found that CoBr2 / MnBr2 - containing catalyst was capable of catalyzing p-xylene oxidation 
effectively at 100oC, which was much lower than the reaction temperature used in the 
commercial process. The milder oxidation temperature has the following advantageous points: 
the lower combustion rates of reactant (PX) and solvent (which produce unwanted CO and CO2) 
[10], the lower equipment corrosion rate, the lower energy cost, and the lower catalyst 
deactivation rate (due to the lower terephthalic acid solubility in acetic acid [3,9]).  
 
2. Experimental  
The oxidation experiments were carried out with a 300 ml stirred reactor made of titanium 
 
 6
significantly affect TA yield in this situation.  TA yield reaches a maximum value of 92.6% at a 
Br/Co atomic ratio of 4, and decreases slightly at the higher Br/Co atomic ratio (TA yields are 
90.8% and 89.7% when Br/Co atomic ratios are 5 and 6, respectively). That is, a large excess of 
Br concentration is detrimental to TA yield. It was proposed that excess dibromide radicals might 
be formed during the chain reaction , which reacted with ArCH2· to produce undesired benzylic 
bromide (ArCH2Br) [4,11]. Therefore, a high bromide concentration might result in the formation 
of an excess of benzylic bromide, which decreases TA yield when Br/Co atomic ratio is greater 
than 4, as shown in Figure 1. 
    
Figure 2 shows TA yield as a function of reaction time for Br/Co atomic ratio = 3,4, and 6 
(catalyst compositions are listed in #4, #5,and #7 of Table 1). The amount of PX (PX/HOAc 
weight ratio = 0.16) used for Figure 2 is two times that used for Figure 1 (PX/HOAc weight ratio 
= 0.08).   Figure 2 indicates that TA yield increases with increasing Br concentration at the 
earlier stage of reaction (at 1 h reaction time, TA yields are 17.7%, 24.1% and 26.1% when Br/Co 
atomic ratios are 3,4,and 6, respectively) , but TA yield decreases with increasing Br at the latter 
stage of reaction (at 3 h reaction time, TA yields are 93.5%,92.7% and 91.1% when Br/Co atomic 
ratios  are 3,4,and 6, respectively).  
Figure 3 shows TA yield as a function of reaction time for Br/Co atomic ratio = 3, and 6  
(catalyst compositions are listed in #4 and # 7 of Table 1) for PX/HOAc weight ratio = 0.32. The 
amount of PX used for Figure 3 is four times that used for Figure 1 (PX/HOAc weight ratio = 
0.08) and is two times that used for Figure 2 (PX/HOAc weight ratio = 0.16) . In Figure 3, the 
catalyst with Br/Co atomic ratio =6 has higher TA yield at the earlier stage of reaction (when t ≦
6 h), but the catalyst with Br/Co atomic ratio =3 has higher TA yield at the latter stage of reaction 
(when t ≧9 h).  That is, the effect of Br/Co atomic ratio on TA yield shown in Figure 3 is 
similar to that shown in Figure 2. 
All of Figures 1-3 indicate that high Br concentration is detrimental to the final TA yield. As 
mentioned above, high bromide concentration might result in the formation of larger amount of 
benzylic bromide [4,11], and lower the final TA yield at the higher Br/Co atomic ratio. At the 
earlier stage of reaction, higher TA yield observed for the catalysts with the higher Br 
concentration (shown in Figures 2 and 3), which should be due to the increase of catalyst activity 
with increasing Br concentration. 
Comparisons of Figures 1-3 indicate that reaction time needed to reach the same TA yield 
increases more rapidly than the increase of reactant concentration (i.e., PX/HOAc ratio) when 
catalyst amount is maintained constant. It takes approximately 1h, 3h, and over 12h to reach 90% 
TA yield for PX/HOAc weight ratio of 0.08 (shown in Figure 1), 0.16 (shown in Figure 2), and 
0.32 (shown in Figure 3), respectively. That is, the higher the PX concentration the lower the TA 
turnover frequency (TOF = TA molecules produces/(Co molecules. reaction time)). At Br/Co 
atomic ratio =3 (catalyst compositions is listed in #4 of Table 1), turnover frequencies are 512/h, 
363/h, and 167/h when PX/HOAc weight ratios are 0.08, 0.16, and 0.32, respectively. 
For the synthesis of terephthalic acid from p-xylene, it was proposed that  the oxidation 
reactions occurred according to the stoichiometry shown in Figure 4 [4 ]. p-Tolualdehyde 
 8
In Figures 5-7, the sum of the final product (TA) and intermediate (TALD,PT, 4-CBA, and TDAD) 
concentrations is approximately equal to the initial reactant (PX) concentration. The mole balance 
on aromatic compounds indicates that the combustion of aromatic species to COx (CO and CO2 ) 
was negligible under the experimental conditions. 
 
3.4. Effect of temperature 
Table 2 shows the effect of reaction temperature  on PX conversion and product/intermediate 
yield in the range of 100-120 ℃.  It is surprising to find that PX conversion decreases with 
increasing reaction temperature in the temperature range. Therefore, the suitable reaction 
temperature for the CoBr2 /cobalt acetate /MnBr2/manganese acetate catalyst system is 100℃ . 
It is known that the conversion of bromide to benzylic bromide decreases Co/Mn/Br catalyst 
activity and PX oxidation rate [12,13]. When all of the active ionic bromide is converted to 
benzylic bromide, the resultant Co/Mn catalyst    is much less active, and imparts a deep 
coloration (brown color) to the system [13]. Therefore, the formation of benzylic bromide can be 
detected from the color of the solution after the oxidation reaction.  
At 100℃, the reaction solution color was golden yellow , which indicated that the formation of 
benzylic bromide was negligible at low temperature. At 110 and 120℃, the solution color was 
brown, which indicated the formation of benzyl bromide was significant. This resulted in  the 
lower active ionic bromide concentration and  the lower PX conversion at the higher reaction 
temperatures  (110 and 120 ℃), as shown in Table 2. 
 
3.5. Kinetics  
Figures 5-7 indicate that TDAD formation is negligible, therefore, PX oxidation to TA should 
mainly occur according to the following four reaction steps in series : 
EDCBA 4k3k2k1k ⎯→⎯⎯→⎯⎯→⎯⎯→⎯                         (1)         
The nomenclature in Equation (1) is used to denote the various species in PX oxidation: A = PX, 
B = TALD, C = PT, D = 4-CBA, and E = TA. To determine the reaction rate parameters from the 
measured species concentration profiles (e.g., Figures 5 - 7), the following differential equations 
were established to describe the reaction system in a batch reactor by assuming a 
pseudo-first-order equation for each step of PX oxidation: 
-dCA/dt =k1CA                                                                         (2) 
dCB/dt =k1CA  -  k2CB                                                                (3) 
dCC/dt =k2CB  -  k3CC                                                                (4) 
dCD/dt =k3CC  -  k4CD                                                                (5)

where rj and k j are the rate and the rate constant of jth step reaction, respectively, Cj is the 
concentration of the jth component, d,θand βare kinetic parameters.  They also found that 
k2〉k4〉k1〉k3, and the rate constant ratios they obtained were in the following ranges: k1/k3 =3.8
→5.43; k2/k3 = 14 → 21.9 ; k4/k3 = 9.1→10.12 . The rate constants obtained by Wang et al. are 
unexpectedly similar to the rate constant ratios we obtained here (k1/k3:3.11→4.6; k2/k3:11 .1→ 
20; k4/k3:10 → 10.22 ( PO2 = 2 atm) ; as shown in Tables 3 and 4). The similarity of  rate 
constant ratios suggests that the reaction mechanism of PX oxidation with CoBr2 /cobalt acetate 
/MnBr2/manganese acetate catalyst system might be similar to the reaction mechanism of PX 
oxidation with Co(OAc)2/Mn(OAc) 2/HBr catalyst system. In addition, the active species of the 
two catalyst systems might be similar to each other. It has been proposed that the 
Co(OAc)2/Mn(OAc) 2/HBr catalyst is not just a single catalyst, but is composed of a large 
number of different active catalyst species, i.e., different coordination compounds [14]. 
Partenheimer [14] suggested that at least five different metal oxidants 
([Co(III)],[Co(III)-Co(II)],[Co(III)-Mn(II)], [Co(III)-COIII], [Co(III) -Mn(III)] ), each with 
varying amounts of aqua ligands , can be formed  from the homogeneous Co/Mn/Br catalyst 
during the p-xylene oxidation in acetic acid .  
 
4. Conclusions 
The oxidation of p-xylene (PX) to terephthalic acid (TA) was carried out in acetic acid (HOAc) 
with the presence of CoBr2/MnBr2 - containing catalysts. Br/Co atomic ratio, reactant 
concentration, reaction temperature, and oxygen pressure affected catalyst performances strongly. 
With the increase of Br/Co atomic ratio, catalyst activity increased but TA selectivity decreased, 
therefore, the optimum Br/Co atomic ratio was around 3. Higher Br concentration was 
detrimental to TA yield, which might be due to the formation of benzylic bromide. The suitable 
reaction temperature was 100℃. Further increase in reaction temperature resulted in the decrease 
of catalyst activity, which was also ascribed to the formation of benzylic bromide.   The 
maximum TA yield obtained was 93.5%, which occurred at 100℃, Br/Co atomic ratio =3 and 
PX/HOAc weight ratio=0.16. The major route for PX oxidation to TA was a four-step series 
reaction with three intermediates (p-tolualdehyde(TALD), p-Toluic acid (PT), 
4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA)).  The rate of each reaction step could be represented by a 
pseudo-first-order kinetics and the rate constants decreased in the following order: k2 (TALD→
PT) > k4 (4-CBA→TA) > k1  (PX→TALD) > k3(PT →4-CBA). The rate constant ratios of 
CoBr2/MnBr2 - containing catalysts ( at 100℃) were unexpectedly similar to the rate constant 
ratios of HBr containing catalyst ( at 184-197℃ ), which suggested that the two catalyst systems 
had similar reaction mechanism and similar active species.

capable of catalyzing 4-CBA hydrogenation effectively at a reaction temperature much lower 
than the temperature used in the commercial process. The lower operating temperature and the 
isolation of palladium core by porous silica shell can reduce the sintering problem of Pd particles 
in PTA refining process.  It can also decrease the energy cost for heating the hydrogenation 
reaction solution.   
2 Experimental  
2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization 
1. Pd@SiO2 core-shell - particles were prepared by coating silica onto the surface of Pd-PVP 
colloids, according to the well-known Stober method, [12].A commercial 5wt% Pd/C catalyst 
(Strem, Newburyport, MA, USA) was also used for comparison and for 4-CBA hydrogenation. 
  
The specific surface area of the catalysts was determined by nitrogen adsorption with a 
Micromeritics surface area analyzer (model ASAP 2020). Catalyst pore size distribution was 
derived from pore volume of the nitrogen desorption branch. Transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were made using JEOL JEM-2010  
and JEOL  JSM7000F, respectively. Crystalline structure was examined by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) crystallography on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The 
exposed Pd surface area was measured with selective chemisorption of carbon monoxide. 
 
2.2 Reaction  studies 
Hydrogenation of 4-CBA was carried out with a 600 ml stirred reactor made of stainless steel 
(supplied by Parr Instruments Co.).  The high-pressure autoclave was equipped with a 
temperature control unit, a pressure gage, a gas inlet valve, a gas sparger, an agitator, a liquid 
sampling valve, and a gas release valve.The PT yield was defined as (moles of PT 
obtained)/(moles of 4-CBA fed to the reactor)× 100%. 
 
 
3    Results  and  discussion  
3.1 Catalytic Performances 
HPLC results indicated that 4-CBA hydrogenation to PT occurred according to the following 
three reaction steps in series: 
A  Æ  B  Æ  C                                           (3) 
The nomenclature in Eq. (3) is used to denote the various species in 4-CBA  hydrogenation : A = 
4-CBA, B = 4-(hydroxymethyl) benzoic acid (i.e., HOH2C – C6H4 –COOH), C=PT .  Reactant A 
disappeared (i.e., 4-CBA conversion =100%) under the reaction condition used for obtaining the 
data. Therefore, PT selectivity is the same as PT yield here because PT yield = PT selectivity

with an average size of around 27 nm [12]. It is known that synthesis conditions (such as the 
reducing agent, reducing temperature, PVP/Pd ratio) can affect the sizes of PVP-stabilized 
nanoparticles [10, 17].  
Pore size distribution measurements of the calcined  Pd@SiO2 sample indicated that most pores 
in the Pd@SiO2 particles were smaller than 4 nm, which are similar to those of Ag@SiO 2 sample. 
These pores should be generated due to the burning off the PVP at 400oC [12].  
4     Conclusions 
 
Pd@SiO2 core - shell - particles were prepared by coating silica shell on PVP-stabilized 
nano-palladium colloids. Porous structure (with pore size < 4nm) was generated due to the 
burning off of the PVP molecules.  The Pd@SiO2 core - shell - particles showed very good 
catalytic performances for the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde to p-toluic acid 
(PT). The best PT yield was around 99% at  160-175 o C, which was much lower than the 
commercial process temperature. Pd XRD pattern of the reduced Pd@SiO2 sample was similar to 
the reported Pd XRD pattern of a Pd/C sample.

技術說明 英 文 ： A method for hydrogenating 
4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) to p-toluic acid (PT) 
is disclosed. p-Toluic acid can be effectively produced 
from 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and hydrogen in the 
presence of a catalyst containing silica and palladium.  
The said catalyst is presented in the core-shell  form, in 
which palladium is in the core and porous silica is in 
the shell.  Compared to the traditional Pd/C catalyst,  
the said core-shell  catalyst exhibits higher p-toluic acid 
yield at the lower hydrogenating temperature and has 
better resistance to catalyst sintering.
