Abstract 
  On-line learning is an asynchronous computer-based learning mode that allows learners to 
learn anytime and anywhere in their own environment using information and communication 
technology. It can be considered as a way to bridge the digital gap. How a computer novice 
performs in such virtual and asynchronous learning environments is an interesting issue in 
human-computer interaction research. This paper presents the results of a study to investigate 
on-line learning performance and computer anxiety for unemployed adult novices. In this study, 
we propose a novel idea that integrates the concept of Shannon entropy into a grey relational 
analysis model. The proposed method was used to measure human information behavior in 
relation to on-line learning performance and computer anxiety. A total of 115 unemployed adults 
voluntarily participated in the experimental study. All experimental subjects were divided into 
groups according to individual differences in gender, age ranges, educational levels, and learning 
performances. Taking advantage of the grey relation entropy operation, we derived the perceptive 
correlations among different classified groups in terms of the accessibility of on-line learning and 
computer anxiety scales, respectively. Through the empirical study, certain on-line learning 
characteristics were also identified.

2. Methodology 
2.1 Subjects 
A total of 115 subjects were selected from the trainees of an on-line computer-training program 
to voluntarily participate in the experimental study. The participants were qualified unemployed 
adults who involuntarily left their jobs. To ensure experimental variables being equitable and 
objective, the overall participants were required to have had no computer experience before the 
experiment. 
2.2. Experimental design and materials 
2.2.1. The elementary computer-training program and on-line learning system 
  In order to conduct this experimental research, an asynchronous learning course was provided 
for the subjects who learned elementary computer skills. The short-term computer-training course 
was financially supported by the Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training (BEVT), 
Council of Labor Affairs, Taiwan. There were three major units contained in the on-line learning 
program: (1) fundamental computer operation (300 minutes), (2) word processing (180 minutes), 
and (3) Internet application (300 minutes). In addition to the three main units, there was an extra 
optional unit concerning the psychological guidance and assistance of learning in the program 
(120 minutes). 
  The on-line learning system mainly consisted of three functions: (1) learning information, (2) 
starting animation, and (3) on-line instruction and case practice. The learning information briefly 
introduced the course subject, learning goals, and other basic knowledge concerning the 
presented course. The starting animation described the learning context with a short narrative 
animation. The on-line instruction function provided context description, content lecture, 
operational guidance, and case practice. The on-line learning system was constructed in an 
interactive multimedia environment including text, graphics, animation, audio, and video 
elements. It was installed in the on-line learning website of the BEVT. 
  This asynchronous learning course was held at the Extension Education Center, Fortune 
Institute of Technology (FIT). The training classroom was available during office hours from 
10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. When connecting to the on-line learning system, participants had to login 
to the Website through the FIT’s network server by entering their own identification code. The 
overall learning time and process were controlled and recorded by the system automatically. 
2.2.2. On-line tests 
  The tests corresponding to the three main units were followed in the on-line learning system. 
Twenty items of closed-ended questions were given in each unit test, and each question contained 
five alternatives with one only correct answer. Each correct response scored 5 points with the full 
score being 100 points. Participants were required to respond to the questions within the time 
allotted. The passing mark was 60 points and the testing time was restricted to 10 minutes for 
each unit test. All three unit test results were concurrently scored and recorded by the system.

3. Results 
3.1. On-line learning achievements 
  The mean score of the overall responses was 72.17 (N=115, S.D.=7.34). According to the score 
ranges, we divided the subjects into three groups: high-performance (scored more than 80), 
medium-performance (scored between 70 and 79), and low-performance (scored less than 69). 
The mean scores of the on-line tests were 82.92 (N=24, S.D.=3.62) for the high-performance 
group, 73.79 (N=44, S.D.=2.97) for the medium-performance group, and 65.16 (N=47, S.D.=2.46) 
for the low-performance group. 
With respect to individual differences in learning achievements, the mean scores of the on-line 
tests were 72.72 (N=27, S.D.=7.22) for the male subjects and 71.91 (N=88, S.D.=7.4) for the 
female subjects. The mean scores of the on-line tests were 72.43 (N=57, S.D.=6.87) for young

  Taking advantage of the means of the computer anxiety measurement results, we constructed 
11 sets of sequences. Letting 0.01ζ = , and respectively substituting the sequence data into the 
GRE operation program, we obtained 121 pairs of GRE grade. The interrelated grades of GRE 
were 0.7051 between male and female groups, 0.7741 among the three different age groups, 
0.7375 among the three different education groups, and 0.8463 among the three different learning 
performance groups.

scales. The differences between the middle-aged group and elderly group, and middle-education 
group and low-education group were significant.

4. Concluding remarks 
According to the on-line test results, males were better than females, particularly in the 
learning achievements of the word processing unit. However, males were found to be more 
anxious than females in terms of the CAS results. The similar correlation between gender groups 
was significant in terms of the on-line learning characteristics, but insignificant in terms of the 
computer anxiety scales. 
Of the three different age groups, the young adult subjects (aged under 44) had the highest 
on-line learning achievements. There was little difference in learning achievements between 
middle-aged (aged 45―54) and elderly (aged over 55) subjects. The elderly subjects had the 
worst on-line learning achievements in the word processing unit. They were also found to be 
more anxious than the other two age groups. The differences between middle-aged subjects and 
elderly subjects were significant in terms of the on-line learning characteristics and computer 
anxiety scales, respectively. For example, when using the on-line learning system for the first 
time, 41.2% of the elderly respondents were amazed, yet 51.2% of the middle-aged respondents 
immediately tried using the system without any hesitation. When an error message appeared on 
the system, 35.3% of the elderly respondents wanted to reboot the system, yet 65.8% of the 
middle-aged respondents wanted to request experienced help. 94.1% of the elderly respondents

achievements, whereas the low-education group did the worst. The low-education group 
perceived the highest measure of computer anxiety while the low-performance group had least 
anxiety of all of the classified groups. Learning performance effect highly correlates with gender 
effect and education effect. The correlation between gender effect and learning performance 
effect was significantly similar in terms of the accessibility of on-line learning but significantly 
different in terms of the computer anxiety scales. On the opposite side, the correlation between 
education effect and learning performance effect was significantly similar in terms of the 
subjects’ computer anxiety scales but significantly different in terms of the accessibility of on-line 
learning. Gender effect and age group effect were also significantly similar in computer anxiety 
perception.
