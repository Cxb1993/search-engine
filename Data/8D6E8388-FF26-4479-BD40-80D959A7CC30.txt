Abstract 
The possibility of utilizing 
nano-composites in making sound 
radiating panels is studied. A procedure 
for fabricating rectangular 
nano-composites sound radiating panels 
is described. A number of rectangular 
flat-panel speakers comprising sound 
radiating panels made of different 
materials are fabricated for experimental 
investigation. In this study, the flat-panel 
speaker comprises a rigid frame, a 
flexible edge surround, a sound radiating 
panel, and an electro-magnetic type 
transducer. The transducer, which is 
located at the center of the sound 
radiating panel, is used to excite the 
panel to produce sound. A method is 
presented to study the sound radiation 
behavior of the rectangular composite 
flat-panel speaker. In the proposed 
method, the finite element method is 
first used to determine the vibration 
response of the sound radiating panel of 
the flat-panel speaker in which the edge 
surround is modeled as a continuously 
distributed spring system. The vibration 
responses of the panel excited at 
different frequencies together with the 
first Rayleigh integral are then used to 
construct the SPL curve of the speaker. 
Experimental SPL curves of the 
flat-panel speakers comprising different 
sound radiating panels were measured to 
validate the proposed method. The 
comparison between the theoretical and 
experimental results has shown that the 
proposed method is capable of 
producing reasonably good SPL curves 
for the flat-panel speakers. The effects of 
panel materials on the the SPL curves of 
the sound radiating panel are studied and 
discussed.

excited at frequencies above the 
fundamental and coincidence 
frequencies of the panel to provide, 
hopefully, high radiation efficiency 
through multi-modal motions within the 
panel. The operating frequency range of 
the radiating panel, however, is not wide 
enough for general purposes and thus 
only suitable for public address 
application. Matsushita [13] presented a 
method to design a long rectangular 
flat-panel speaker in which two 
transducers were used to excite the 
radiator panel for sound radiation. In this 
method, the locations of the transducer 
are chosen in such a way that the adverse 
effects on sound radiation of some 
resonant modes are suppressed or even 
eliminated. Azima et al [14] proposed a 
distributed mode method for the design 
of a flat-panel acoustic device which 
consisted of a panel radiator capable of 
sustaining bending waves associated 
with resonant modes in the panel 
radiator and used transducers to excite 
the resonant modes of the panel radiator. 
Their proposed distributed mode method 
includes analysis of distribution of 
flexural resonant modes and 
identification of dead/combined 
dead-spots of the panel radiator. The 
transducers are mounted at some 
particular points which, hopefully, will 
not be coincident with the 
dead/combined dead-spots, on the 
radiating panel so that all the resonant 
modes of the panel can be excited for 
sound radiation. The excitation locations 
determined in the distributed mode 
method, however, may create a number 
of problems for the panel-form speaker. 
For instance, some resonant modes may 
be overexcited so that undesirable sound 
intensities at the associated resonant 
frequencies may be generated and the 
resonant modes that have adverse effects 
on sound radiation may be excited to 
cause sound interference. Kam [15] 
presented a method to design laminated 
composite flat-panel speakers. In this 
method, excitation locations are 
determined in such a way that the 
resonant modes which have adverse 
effects on sound radiation are suppressed 
while those have beneficial effects on 
sound radiation are properly encouraged 
via an optimal design approach. In view 
of the previous design methods for 
flat-panel speakers, it is obvious that the 
properties of the resonant modes of 
radiating panels have direct effects on 
sound radiation of flat-panel speakers. 
Therefore, more in-depth research work 
on vibration and sound radiation 
behaviors of flat-panel speakers is 
needed if high performance flat-panel 
speakers that can radiate good quality 
sound are to be designed. 
The sound radiating panel of a 
composite flat-panel speaker can be 
modeled as an elastically restrained 
composite plate. Regarding the vibration 
of composite plates, many researchers 
have proposed different techniques to 
determine the dynamic behavior of 
composite plates. Among them, the finite 
 4
and experimental approaches. The 
forced vibration analysis of the flexibly 
supported sound radiating panel of the 
flat-panel speaker is accomplished using 
the finite element method. The vibration 
responses of the sound radiating panel 
excited at different frequencies are used 
in the Rayleigh first integral to construct 
the SPL curves for studying the sound 
radiation behavior of the flat-panel 
speaker. The capability of the proposed 
method in predicting accurate SPL 
curves is validated by experimental 
results. The mode shapes that have 
destructive effects on sound radiation of 
the flat-panel speakers are identified. 
The effects of panel materials on the 
SPL curves of the flat-panel speakers are 
investigated.  
 
Finite Element Analysis of Flat-Panel 
Speaker  
The rectangular flat-panel speaker 
under consideration is composed of a 
rigid frame and a sound radiator which 
are schematically shown in Fig. 1. The 
sound radiator, on the other hand, 
comprises a flexible surround, a sound 
radiating panel, two interior elastic 
restraints, and an electro-magnetic type 
transducer. The transducer is located at 
the panel center while the two interior 
elastic restraints are located 
symmetrically on the two sides of the 
panel center. Without loss of generality, 
the sound radiating panel is assumed to 
be a composite sandwich plate of 
track-and-field shape in which the core 
and face sheets are made of different 
kinds of orthotropic materials. For an 
orthotropic lamina, neglecting the 
normal stress in the thickness direction, 
the stress-strain relations can be 
expressed in matrix form as [39]

The electro-magnetic transducer uses 
the vertical motion of the voice coil of 
diameter dv to excite the sound radiating 
panel. The interior elastic restraints are 
used to position the voice coil in the 
magnetic field existing in the transducer 
and stabilize the motion of the voice coil.

different excitation frequencies can then 
be determined by solving eqn (6). 
 
Sound Radiation of Laminated 
Composite Plates 
A speaker is a device used to recover 
and magnify the original sound stored in 
the input electrical signals. For a high 
fidelity speaker, it is important to have a 
uniformly distributed SPL spectrum in 
the operating frequency range so that the 
sounds at different frequencies in this 
range are magnified equally. Therefore, 
the design of a relatively flat SPL curve 
for a speaker is an important step to 
achieve high fidelity. In the sound 
radiation analysis of a flat-panel speaker, 
it is assumed that air loading has 
negligible effects on plate vibration. 
Then referring to the baffled speaker 
with area S shown in Fig. 5, the sound 
pressure p(r, t) resulting from the 
vibration of the plate can be determined 
using the Rayleigh first integral.

above material constants were less than 
3%. A study of the mechanical behavior 
of the surround had shown that the 
rotational stiffness of the surround was 
negligible. The spring constant 
intensities of the surround and interior 
elastic restraints determined from 
experiments were KS = 7.5 10× 4 N/m2 
and KR =0.025 N, respectively. The mass 
and radius of the voice coil were 0.2 g 
and 25mm, respectively. The 
experimental setup for sound pressure 
level measurement of the flat-panel 
speakers are schematically shown in Fig. 
6 in which the baffled speaker was tested 
in an anechoic chamber. The sound 
pressure level of the speaker subjected to 
excitation with one Watt power was 
measured by a microphone placed at the 
location one meter away from the center 
of the plate. The sound measurement 
instrument LMS [41] provided electrical 
signals sweeping from 20 to 20K Hz to 
the transducer which in term excited the 
panel of the speaker to radiate sounds. 
The sound pressure signals picked up by 
the microphone were processed by LMS 
to produce the SPL curve of the speaker. 
A number of flate-panel speakers with 
dimensions of 38x30mm, 60x30mm, and 
42x20mm comprising different panels 
were also fabricated for investigating the 
effects of different materials on the SPL 
curves of the speakers. 
 
Results and Discussions 
The present sound radiation method is 
used to study the sound radiation 
behaviors of the flat-panel speakers 
which have been tested. To demonstrate 
the capability of the present method, the 
theoretical SPL curves of the speakers 
are constructed and compared with the 
experimental ones. The theoretical and 
experimental SPL curves of the speakers 
composed of different sound radiating 
panel are plotted in Fig. 7 and 8 for 
comparisons. From the experimental 
SPL curves, it is noted that the average 
SPLs produced by the foam and 
composite sandwich panels were 78 and 
75 dB, respectively. The foam panel 
could produce the highest SPL because 
its weight was lighter. The mid-range 
dips of the foam and sandwich panels 
occurred at around 3KHz and the 
associated depths of the mid-range dips 
were 12 and 2 dB, respectively. It is also 
noted that the depth of the mid-range dip 
became smaller as the panel stiffness 
increased. The above results have thus 
revealed the fact that a panel has lighter 
weight and higher stiffness can produce 
higher sensitivity and flatter SPL curve. 
Comparing the experimental and 
theoretical results, it is noted that the 
percentage differences between the 
theoretical and experimental average 
SPLs as well as the depths of the 
mid-range SPL dips are less than 1 %. 
Thus for each of the speakers, the 
theoretical and experimental SPL curves 
are in fairly good agreement. The mode 
shapes associated with the mid-range 
SPL dips of the sound radiating panels 
are symmetric with respect to the centers
