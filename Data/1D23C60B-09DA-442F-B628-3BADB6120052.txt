全球定位系統(GPS)可全天候提供精確的位置、速度與時間的資訊給全球的使用者。在 GPS
系統中，其導航數據資料是利用直接展頻 (DS-SS) 分碼多工的方式進行傳遞。由於展頻本身具抗
干擾性，GPS 可利用 C/A 碼 43 dB 的程序增益(Processing gain: PG)，將小功率的干擾信號予以壓
制，但是當干擾源功率增大，而超過程序增益時，此時將導致接收機之同步迴路發生信號處理失
鎖，而無法接收衛星訊號。改進的方法就是必須加入抗干擾的功能來彌補以上的狀況發生。本計

Abstract: The global positioning system (GPS) provides accurate positioning and timing information
useful in many applications. The GPS satellites broadcast ranging codes and navigation data with the
technique of direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS). Although DS-SS inherently can cope with low
power narrowband and wideband obstacles by its near 43-dB processing gain, it cannot cope with high
power obstacles. The approaches of system performances that can be further enhanced by preprocessing
to reject the intentional or unintentional jamming will be investigated in this project. It has been
demonstrated that the performance of direct sequence spread spectrum system in the presence of
interference can be enhanced through the use of adaptive filters. A recurrent neural network (RNN)
predictor for the GPS anti-jamming applications will be proposed in this project. The received sample is
given by r(k)=s(k)+n(k)+i(k), where the s(k) is the transmitted signal, the ambient white noise n(k) is
modeled as white Gaussian noise, and the interference i(k) is modeled as having a bandwidth much less
than the spread spectrum bandwidth. The s(k) and n(k) sequences are wideband signals with nearly flat
spectra. Thus, these two sequences cannot be estimated from their past values. Only the interfering signal
i(k) can be predicted from its correlated property. The adaptive RNN predictor is utilized to accurately
predict the narrowband waveform based on a Kalman filter-based algorithm. As the observation noise of
received signals is highly non-Gaussian, an RNN estimator with a nonlinear structure is suited to
accurately predict the narrowband signals based on the real-time learning paradigms. Two kinds of
Kalman filtering algorithms, i.e., (1) node decoupled extended Kalman filter (NDEKF), and (2) unscented
Kalman filter (UKF), are adopted to achieve better performance in terms of convergence rate and quality
of solution while requiring less computation time and memory. The simulation results of the KF-based
RNN predictor are obtained by using Matlab/ SystemView tool to verify the performances. Four types of
narrowband interference, i.e. continuous wave interference (CWI), multi-tone CWI (MCWI), swept CWI
(SCWI), and pulsed CWI (PCWI), are considered to emulate realistic circumstances. The
interference-to-noise ratio (INR) is varied from 20 to 50 dB. The anti-jamming performances are
evaluated via extensive simulation by computing mean squared prediction error (MSPE) and
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements.

32. Received Signal Models
GPS systems are continuously going through progressive evolution in the field of positioning and
navigation. A receiver computes its position, velocity and time solution by processing received data from
a constellation of satellites. Unfortunately, the low power GPS signal is susceptible to many types of
interference, which can be either intentional or unintentional. This interference can degrade the quality of,
or totally disable some of, the processes in the GPS receivers.
The satellites broadcast ranging codes and navigation data at two frequencies: primary L1 and
secondary L2, and only the L1 signal, free for civilian use, will be considered. A simplified block diagram
of an anti-jamming GPS model is shown in Fig. 1. The transmitted spread spectrum signal is

where )(tn is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with variance 2 , and the jamming source )(tj
has a bandwidth much smaller than the GPS spreading bandwidth.
The received signal is bandpass filtered, amplified and down converted. Due to the downconversion, the
spectrum of the signal is shifted to the baseband frequency. To further simplify the analysis, we assume
that the received signal passes through a filter matched to the chip waveform and is sampled
synchronously once during each chip interval. The observation

and white, and the jamming source being considered has a bandwidth much narrower than CT/1 . The
)(kS sequence is )()( kCAkD  taking values of 1.
The low power jamming signal can be suppressed by GPS receivers with the 43dB processing gain (C/A
code). However, if strong jamming signals are present, they can result in degradation of navigation
accuracy or even complete loss of receiver tracking. In this project, five kinds of narrowband interference
53.1 RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK DYNAMICS
The detailed structure of an RNN is illustrated in Fig. 4. It has a neural module and a comparator of
its own. Specifically, the module consists of a fully connected RNN with N hidden neurons, P external
input neurons, and one output neuron. In each neuron, one-unit delayed version outputs of hidden neurons
are assumed to be fed back to the input. Besides the P+N inputs, one bias input whose value is alwayas at
+1 is included. Let matrix aW denote the synaptic weights of the N neurons in the hidden layer that are
connected to the feedback nodes in the input layer, and matrix bW represent the synaptic weights of
these hidden neurons that are connected to the input nodes. It is further assumed that the bias term of
hidden neurons are absorbed in the weight matrix bW . The weight matrices aW and bW can be
expressed as
 TTaNTajTaa WWWW ......1 (6.1)
 TTbNTbjTbb WWWW ......1 (6.2)
and    NjTba WWWWWW ......1 (6.3)
where aW , bW and W are, respectively, N-by-N, N-by-(P+1) and (P+N+1)-by-N matirces. The ajW ,
bjW and jW are defined by

A (P+1)-by-1 input vector )(kR can be constructed in terms of GPS observation samples
)1(),....,1(),(  Pkrkrkr and a bias input (+1). Let the N-by-1 vector )(kX denote the state of
vector of an RNN, and the 1-by-1 vector )(ky denote the corresponding output of the system. These
vectors can then be described as

Based on the definition above, an input vector consisting of the total (P+N+1) input signal can be
represented as

4. Simulation results
The simulation results of the UKF-based RNP are obtained to confirm the jamming rejection
characteristics. The performance is expressed in terms of SNR improvement and MSPE.
(1) SNR improvement: The metric adopted to verify the steady state performance is the “SNR
improvement”, which is defined in [2] and given by,

(2) Mean squared prediction error (MSPE, MSPEV ): The MSPE is used as an index to evaluate the
convergence rate of transient responses for various algorithms. It is defined as,
