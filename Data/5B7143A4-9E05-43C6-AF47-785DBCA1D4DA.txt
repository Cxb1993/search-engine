control system consists of an adaptive VSS controller
for coarse control, an adaptive fuzzy controller for
fine control, and a hysteresis switching mechanism
for switching of the previous two controllers. The
adaptive VSS controller is used to force the premise
variable to enter the universe of discourse in finite time.
While the premise variable is kept within the universe
of discourse, the adaptive fuzzy controller will tune
its parameters and gradually learn the capability to
stabilize the plant. At the boundary of the universe
of discourse, a hysteresis switching scheme between
the adaptive VSS control law and the adaptive fuzzy
control law will be proposed. We shall show that after
finite times of switching, the premise variable of the
fuzzy system will remain in the universe of discourse
and stability of the adaptive control system will be
attained by applying the Lyapunov direct method.
The remainder of this work is organized as fol-
lows. The problem to be attacked and the hysteresis
switching adaptive control scheme are described in
Section 2. The adaptive VSS controller is proposed and
analyzed in Section 3. Then, the considered adaptive
fuzzy control is presented in Section 4. Analysis of the
switching control system is made in Section 5 together
with a simulation example. Finally, conclusions and
discussions are given in Section 6.
Notations
For a vector x = [ x1 x2 · · · xn ]T , the asso-
ciated swap operation is defined as
swap(x) = [ xn xn−1 · · · x1 ]T
For a vector x, we write x ≥ 0 if every entry of x is
greater than or equal to zero.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND THE
HYSTERESIS SWITCHING ADAPTIVE CONTROL
Consider the plant
x˙ = f(x) + u (1)
where f(x) is a scalar nonlinear continuous function
of the scalar variable x and u ∈ R1 is the input. For
the nonlinear continuous function f(x), we make the
following assumptions.
Assumption 1: f(x) is a continuous function and
admits its maximum fmax on the compact connected
set Ωx with
fmax = max
x∈Ωx
|f(x)| (2)
where fmax is an unknown positive number.
Assumption 2: The function f(x) satisfies¯¯¯¯

≤ κf (3)
for x ∈ Ωx where κf is an unknown positive number.
Assumption 3: For x /∈ Ωx, there is a least upper
bound ψ(x) of f(x) satisfying
|f(x)| ≤ c∗1 |x|+ c∗2 |x|2 = ψ(x) for x /∈ Ωx (4)

where c∗1 and c∗2 are unknown positive parameters.
Assumption 4: We assume that½
xf(x) > 0, if x 6= 0
f(x) = 0, if x = 0 (5)
and f(x) is a convex function for x ∈ Ωx. Also to
simplify system analysis, we shall assume f(x) is an
odd function, i.e.,
f(−x) = −f(x) (6)
An example of such a function f(x) is given by
f(x) = ∗x |x|+ μ∗x (7)
with ∗ > 0 and μ∗ > 0 under which the equilibrium
point 0 of the system dynamics (1) is unstable. In this
study, we shall consider the case that the nonlinear
function f(x) is unknown and a fuzzy approximator
F (x|θ) will be used to approximate an ideal nonadap-
tive stabilizing controller in the universe of discourse
Ωx = [−1, 1] where x is the only premise variable.
Basically, when the state trajectory x(t) is outside the
universe of discourse Ωx, by utilizing the structure
information of f(x) given in (4) in Assumption 3,
we shall develop an adaptive VSS control uV SS(t) to
force the state trajectory entering Ωx. On the other
hand, if the state trajectory x(t) is staying within Ωx,
an adaptive fuzzy control ufuzzy(t) will be applied
to further ensure that the system will be ultimately as-
ymptotically stable. Since switching between these two
control laws with infinite frequency at the boundary of
the region Ωx may happen, we shall use a hysteresis
switching control as described in the following to
avoid this problem. Let h, with 0 < h < 1, be the
hysteresis size and define the hysteresis zone Ωh as
Ωh = {x| 1− h ≤ |x| ≤ 1}. The hysteresis switching
control structure, as shown in Fig. 1, is described as
follows. At t = 0, the control structure is defined as
u(0) =
½
uV SS(0), if |x(0)| > 1− h
ufuzzy(0), if |x(0)| ≤ 1− h (8)
For t > 0, while x(t) is outside the hysteresis zone
Ωh, the control input u(t) is defined as
u(t) =
½
uV SS(t), if |x(t)| > 1
ufuzzy(t), if |x(t)| < 1− h (9)
and on the contrary, while x(t) is inside the hysteresis
zone Ωh, u(t) is defined as
u(t) =
½
uV SS(t), if u(t−) = uV SS(t−)
ufuzzy(t), if u(t−) = ufuzzy(t−)

If x(t0) > 1 − h, we can show that there is a finite
time t1 such that x(t1) = 1 − h with t1 − t0 ≤ T1
where T1 is defined in (14). By contradiction, assume
that x(t) > 1− h > 0 for t ∈ [t0, t0 + T1] . Then, we
have
Z t0+T1
t0
x2(τ)dτ > (1− h)2T1 =
Va(t0)
r
which contradicts inequality (17). This verifies the
assertion. Similarly, if x(t0) < −(1 − h), there is
a finite time t1 such that x(t1) = −(1 − h) with
t1 − t0 ≤ T1. This ends the proof. ¥
IV. DESIGN OF THE ADAPTIVE FUZZY CONTROL
For the plant in (1), the only premise variable of the
fuzzy system is x and the universe of discourse Ωx is
chosen as Ωx = [−1, 1]. The rule base of the T-S fuzzy
system is defined as: for 1 ≤ l ≤ L,
Rule l : If x is Fl, then y = θl.
where Fl is the fuzzy set with membership function
μFl(x) and θl is the value specified in the antecedent
part of the l−th rule. The number L, which is the total
number of rules, will be chosen as an odd number. A
typical case is shown in Fig. 2 where the set of IF-
THEN rules is complete, consistent, and continuous
[10]. Based on the above rule base, the T-S fuzzy sys-
tem, consisting of the singleton fuzzyifier, the product
inference engine, and the center average defuzzifier
[10], can be expressed as
F (x, θ) = ξT (x)θ (18)
where
θ = [θ1, ..., θL]
T ,
ξl(x) =
μFl(x)
LP
i
μFl(x)
,
ξ(x) = [ξ1(x), ..., ξL(x)]
T (19)
From Fig. 2, we can observe that
LX
i
μFl(x) = 1,
for any x ∈ Ωx and
ξ(x) =
£
μF1(x), ..., μFL(x)
¤T (20)
with L = 5. From the triangular membership functions
shown in Fig. 2, we have, for any x ∈ Ωx,
kξ(x)k2 = μ2Fi(x) + μ2Fi+1(x) (21)
for 1 ≤ i ≤ L− 1 and
μFi(x) + μFi+1(x) = 1 (22)
From (21) and (22), it is obvious that
1
2
≤ kξ(x)k2 ≤ 1 (23)
Note that since Ωx = [−1, 1] is symmetric with respect
to the origin, the rule base will be chosen to symmetric
in the sense that
ξ(−x) = ξ¯(x) (24)
where ξ¯(x) =swap(ξ(x)).
Now let Ai, for 1 ≤ i ≤ L, be the support of the
membership function μFi(x), i.e.,
Ai =

x ∈ Ωx
¯¯
μFi(x) > 0
ª
Denote di as the center of the membership function
μFi(x) for 1 ≤ i ≤ L and γi as the point such
that μFi(γi) = μFi+1(γi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ L − 1. For
the convenience of further analysis, now partition the
universe of discourse Ωx as Ωx = ∪2L−2i=1 Ωx,i where
Ωx,2i−1 = [di, γi), for 1 ≤ i ≤
L− 1
2
Ωx,2i = [γi, di+1), for 1 ≤ i ≤
L− 1

Ωx,2i−1 = (di, γi], for
L+ 3
2
≤ i ≤ L− 1
Ωx,2i = (γi, di+1], for
L+ 1
2
≤ i ≤ L− 1
Remark 1: Suppose that the membership functions
are specified as shown in Fig. 2. Then, according to
Lemma 3, we have both θˆ1(t) and θˆ2(t) are of non-
positive values and monotone decreasing. On the other
hand, θˆ4(t) and θˆ5(t) are of non-negative values and
monotone increasing.
Lemma 4: The response x(t) of the hysteresis
switching robust adaptive control defined as in (9),
(10), (??), and (??) is symmetric in the sense that ifn
x(t), θˆ(t)
o
and
©
y(t), θˇ(t)
ª
are the system responses
corresponding to the initial states x(0) and −x(0),
respectively, then y(t) = −x(t) and θˇ(t) = −θ¯(t)
where θ¯(t) =swap(θˆ(t)).
Proof : (i) First, we shall show that the response of
the adaptive VSS control system is symmetric. Since
both f(x) and (cˆ1 |x|+ cˆ2 |x|2+ r |x|)sign(x) are odd
functions of x, so is their sum. Let y(t) = −x(t). Then,
by multiplying -1 to both sides of the first equation in
(30), we have
−x˙ = −f(x) + (cˆ1 |x|+ cˆ2 |x|2 + r |x|)sign(x)
= f(−x)− (cˆ1 |x|+ cˆ2 |x|2 + r |x|)sign(−x)
where we have used the property that f(x) is an odd
function, i.e., f(−x) = −f(x). The above differential
equation implies that y(t) = −x(t) is the solution
to the closed-loop dynamics defined as, with y(0) =
−x(0)
⎧
⎨
⎩
y˙ = f(y)− (cˆ1 |y|+ cˆ2 |y|2 + r |y|)sign(y)
c˙1 = Γ1 |x|2 , c1(0) = 0
c˙2 = Γ1 |x|3 , c2(0) = 0
(36)
Note that the trajectories c1(t) and c2(t) are the same
for the systems in (30) and (36).
(ii) Next, we shall show that the response of the
adaptive fuzzy system defined in (31) is symmetric.
Now define θ¯ =swap(θˆ) and ξ¯ =swap(ξ). Then it
follows that
θ¯T ξ¯(x) = θˆ
T
ξ(x)
Note that due to the symmetric structure of the fuzzy
sets in the rule base, we have
ξ¯(x) = ξ(−x)
Let y(t) = −x(t) and θˇ = −θ¯. Then, by multiplying
-1 to both sides of the first equation in (31), we get
−x˙ = −f(x) + θˆ
T
ξ(x)
= f(−x) + θˆ
T
ξ(x)
which implies
y˙ = f(y) + θ¯T ξ¯(x)
= f(y) + θ¯T ξ(−x)
= f(y)− θˇT ξ(y)
Similarly, by the swapping operation and the symmet-
ric property of the vector ξ(x) in (24), the second
equation in (31) can be expressed as
.
θ¯ = ξ¯(x)(x) = ξ(−x)(x)
Now multiplying -1 to both sides of the last equation,
one has
−
.
θ¯ = ξ(−x)(−x) = ξ(y)(y)
and by the definition of the vector θˇ, it can be con-
cluded that .
θˇ = ξ(y)(y)
Therefore, the responses y(t) = −x(t) and θˇ = −θ¯
consist of the solution to the closed-loop dynamics of
the adaptive fuzzy control system in (31)(
y˙ = f(y)− θˇT ξ(y), y(0) = −x(0)
.
θˇ = ξ(y)(y), θˇ(0) = 0
(37)
(iii) Finally, we note that the switching mechanism
defined in (9) and (10) is symmetric to the origin
x = 0.
By combining the results in parts (i), (ii), and (iii),
the assertion can be concluded. This completes the
proof. ¥
Due to the symmetry of the responses of the switch-
ing control system as described in Lemma 4, we shall
assume x(0) > 0 in the analysis of the dynamics of
the switching control system. If x(0) > 1 − h, then
the adaptive VSS control law in (30) will ensure that
there is a finite time t1 such that x(t1) = 1 − h and
x(t) > 1 − h for t ∈ [0, t1). At t = t1, the adaptive
fuzzy control law in (31) will then be applied.
A. Analysis of switching behavior
In this section, we shall focus on discuss switching
behavior of the switching control law at the boundaries
of the hysteresis zone Ωh = [1− h, 1]∪[−1,−(1−h)].
For further analysis, we shall need some definitions.
Definition 1: We say that continuous switching of
N times at the positive boundary x = 1 − h happens
at t = ti for 1 ≤ i ≤ N with ti < ti+1 if there are
finite time instants tN+1 and t¯i with ti < t¯i < ti+1
for 1 ≤ i ≤ N such that (i) the adaptive VSS
controller is applied in (t0, t1) for some t0 < t1, (ii)
the adaptive fuzzy controller is used for t ∈ [ti, t¯i]
with x(t) ∈ [1− h, 1] for 1 ≤ i ≤ N , (iii) the adaptive
VSS controller is applied within the interval (t¯i, ti+1)
for 1 ≤ i ≤ N , and (iv) the adaptive fuzzy control law
is used after t = tN+1 such that there is no time instant
t¯N+1 such that {x(t) |tN+1 ≤ t ≤ t¯N+1 } ⊂ [1− h, 1],
x(t¯N+1) = 1, and the adaptive VSS control law is
applied after t = t¯N+1. For the above situation, we
also say that continuous switching of N times at the
positive boundary x = 1− h happens since t = t1. If
N = 1, we say a switching at the positive boundary
x = 1 − h happens at t = t1. Similarly, we may
let N → ∞, in this case we shall say continuous
switching of infinite times at the positive boundary
x = 1 − h happens at t = ti for 1 ≤ i < ∞ with
Proof: Since a switching at the boundary x = 1−h
happens at t = t1, by Definition 1, we have x(t2) =
x(t1) = 1 − h, x(t¯1) = 1, x(t) ∈ [1− h, 1] for t ∈
[t1, t¯1], and the adaptive control law is applied during
the interval [t1, t¯1]. From the switching control law
defined in (30) and (31), we see that the parameter
vector θˆ(t) is frozen during the interval (t¯1, t2) and
thus according to the second equation of (31), we have
θˆ(t2) = θˆ(t¯1) = θˆ(t1) +
Z t¯1
t1
ξ(x(τ))x(τ)d(τ) (44)
The value of the fuzzy approximator F (x(t), θˆ(t))
evaluated at t = t2 is given by
F (x(t2), θˆ(t2)) = ξT (x(t2))θˆ(t2) = ξT (x(t1))θˆ(t¯1)
Now, by applying (44), we get
F (x(t2), θˆ(t2))
= ξT (x(t1))

Since x(t) ∈ [1− h, 1] for t ∈ [t1, t¯1], from the
membership functions defined in Fig. 2, we have
ξ(x) =
£
0 0 0 2− 2x 2x− 1

ξ(x(τ))− ξ(x(t1))
=

(x(τ)− x(t1))
for t ∈ [t1, t¯1] . Note that x(t1) = 1− h. Therefore, it
follows from inequality (27) that
ξT (x(t1)) [ξ(x(τ))− ξ(x(t1))]
= [8(1− h)− 6] (x(τ)− x(t1))
≥ 0
where the fact x(τ)− x(t1) = x(τ)− (1− h) ≥ 0 for
t ∈ [t1, t¯1] has been used. Using (45) and (23), we can
obtain
F (x(t2), θˆ(t2))
≥ F (x(t1), θˆ(t1)) + ξT (x(t1))ξ(x(t1))

Since x(t) ∈ [1− h, 1] for t ∈ [t1, t¯1] , following from
Lemma 3, we have
x˙(t) = f(x(t))− θˆ
T
(t)ξ(x(t)) ≤ fmax
Therefore, with x(t1) = 1−h and x(t¯1) = 1, we have
t¯1 − t1 ≥
h
fmax
This shows inequality (42). Analysis of the case x =
−(1− h) is omitted. ¥
Remark 2: We shall note that when the adaptive
control law is applied beginning from t = t1, we have
x˙(t1) = f(x(t1))− θˆ
T
(t1)ξ(x(t1))
= f(1− h)− θˆ
T
(t1)ξ(x(t1))
Therefore, if f(1 − h) is greatly larger than
θˆ
T
(t1)ξ(x(t1)), then a switch of control law at x =
1 − h may happens due to instability of the adaptive
control system under the current parameter setting. To
avoid continuous switching behavior at x = 1−h, the
only way is to increase the value of F (x(t), θˆ(t)) =
θˆ
T
(t)ξ(x(t)). Lemma 6 shows that if the adaptive
control law is applied beginning from t = t2 just after
a switch of control law at x = 1−h happened at t = t1,
then with the learning capability of θˆ
T
(t), x˙(t1) will
be decreased by an amount ∆F as indicated in (42) so
that the adaptive control system at t = t2 has a better
chance to avoid continuous switching at the boundary
x = 1− h.
Remark 3: Since we shall spend at least hfmax time
length to complete a switching, this implies that if
continuous switching of infinite times at the positive
boundary x = 1 − h happens since t = t1, then such
a infinite-times switching can not be completed in a
finite interval.
Lemma 7: Suppose that a switching at the boundary
x = 1 − h happens at t = t1 and the adaptive fuzzy
control is applied during the interval [t1, t¯1]. In this
case, θˆ5(t)− θˆ4(t) is a monotone increasing function
of t in the intervals [t1, t¯1] . Particularly, at t = t¯1, we
have
θˆ5(t¯1)−θˆ4(t¯1) ≥ θˆ5(t1)−θˆ4(t1)+
4εh(1− h)h
fmax
(46)
Moreover, if θˆ5(t1) ≥ θˆ4(t1), then θˆ5(t) ≥ θˆ4(t) for
t ∈ [t1, t¯1] and
F (ξ(x(t)), θˆ(t)) ≥ F (ξ(x(t1)), θˆ(t1) (47)
for t ∈ [t1, t¯1]. In addition, if x(t) is also non-
decreasing, then F (ξ(x(t)), θˆ(t)) is a monotone in-
creasing function of t in the intervals [t1, t¯1] .
Proof: For t ∈ [t1, t¯1], we have
θˆ5(t) = θˆ5(t1) +
Z t

Suppose that we choose N such that

and thus fmax−N∆F < 0. Then, following from (41)
and (56), we have
x(t¯N+I1) ≤ 1− h+ (fmax −N∆F )
h
fmax
< 1− h
However, the above inequality contradicts the assump-
tion that a continuous switching of infinite times at the
positive boundary x = 1−h happens since t = t1. This
completes the proof. ¥
Lemma 10: It is impossible that a switching at the
positive boundary x = 1 − h (or at the negative
boundary x = −(1− h)) happens infinite times since
any finite time t = t1.
Proof: By contradiction, assume that a switch at
the positive boundary x = 1 − h (or at the negative
boundary x = −(1− h)) happens infinite times at t =
ti for 1 ≤ i < ∞ with ti < ti+1. Denote a time
sequence t¯i for 1 ≤ i < ∞ with ti < t¯i < ti+1 such
that the adaptive fuzzy control law is applied in [ti, t¯i] .
Also define a time sequence tˇi for 1 ≤ i <∞ such that
the adaptive VSS control law is applied in
¡
t¯i, tˇi
¢
and
ti < t¯i < tˇi ≤ ti+1 for 1 ≤ i < ∞. Then, since the
adaptive fuzzy control is applied in [ti, t¯i], following
from Lemma 6, we have
θˆ5(t¯i)− θˆ5(ti) =
Z t¯i
ti
μF5(x(τ))x(τ)dτ
≥ μF5(1− h)(1− h) (t¯i − ti)
≥ μF5(1− h)(1− h)
h
fmax
Since θˆ5(t) is monotone increasing, i.e., θˆ5(ti+1) ≥
θˆ5(t¯i) as ti+1 ≥ t¯i, we have
θˆ5(ti+1)− θˆ5(ti) ≥ θˆ5(t¯i)− θˆ5(ti)
≥ μF5(1− h)(1− h)
h
fmax
Therefore, recursively using the above inequality, one
can obtain
θˆ5(tN+1) ≥ θˆ5(t1) +NμF5(1− h)(1− h)
h
fmax
Since μF5(x) is monotone increasing in the interval
[1− h, 1], for t ∈ [tN+1, t¯N+1] , we have
θˆ
T
(t)ξ(x(t))

However, the above inequality contradicts the assump-

happens infinite times since t = t1. This completes the
proof. ¥
Lemma 11: Under the specified switching mecha-
nism in (8)-(10) including the adaptive VSS control in
(30) and the adaptive fuzzy control in (31), we have
the following results.
(i) there is a finite time tf0 such that x(t) ∈ Ωx and
the adaptive fuzzy control is used for t ≥ tf0
and
(ii) the parameters cˆ1(t) and cˆ2(t) in the adaptive
VSS control are bounded for t ∈ [0,∞).
Proof: (Part i) Suppose that x(0) > 1−h. Then the
adaptive VSS control in (30) will ensure that there is
a finite time t1 such that x(t1) = 1 − h and x(t) >
1− h for t ∈ [0, t1) as stated in Lemma 2. At t = t1,
the adaptive fuzzy control law in (31) will then be
applied. When applying the adaptive fuzzy control law
at some time instant t = ts, the case that a continuous
switching of infinite times at the positive boundary x =
1 − h since t = ts has been excluded by Lemma 9.
Therefore, there are three possible cases at t = ts.
(A1) There is no control law switching happened at
the boundary x = 1 − h since t = ts, i.e.,
{x(t) |t ≥ ts } ⊂ Ωx = [−1, 1].
(A2) There is no control law switching happened at
the boundary x = 1− h at t = ts and there are
switching operations after t = ts.
(A3) A continuous switching of finite times happens
at the positive boundary x = 1− h since t = ts.
The above three cases are also applied to the situ-
ation that x(0) < −(1 − h). If |x(0)| ≤ 1 − h, then
the adaptive fuzzy control will be applied at t = 0 and
there are two possible cases.
(B1) There is no switching of control laws for t ≥ 0,
i.e., {x(t) |t ≥ 0} ⊂ Ωx = [−1, 1].
(B2) There are switching operations after t = 0.
Combining the situations (A1)-(A3) and (B1)-(B2),
we can conclude that there are two possibilities for the
trajectory {x(t), t ≥ 0} .
(C1) There is a finite time tf0 such that x(t) ∈ Ωx and
the adaptive fuzzy control is used for t ≥ tf0 .
(C2) A switching of control law at either x = 1 − h
or x = −(1− h) happens infinite times.
Note that Cases (C1) and (C2) are mutually exclu-
sive, since the time to complete a switching is greater
Suppose that we choose N such that

which contradicts the assumption that x(t¯N+1) ≥
γL−1. Therefore, we have σ (S2L−2) <∞. The above
analysis can be also applied to the case i = 1 to show
that σ (S1) <∞.
(Part ii: for i = 2 and i = 2L− 3)
First, by contradiction, assume that σ (S2L−3) =∞.
In this case, there are two possibilities: (i) there is
a finite time ta such that x(t) ∈ Ωx,2L−3 for t ≥
ta ≥ tf0 and (ii) the trajectory x(t) keeps visiting
the connected region Ωx,2L−3 in infinite disjoined
time intervals. We can use the same methodology as
done in the proof of Lemma 5 to verify that the first
possibility is impossible. In the following, we shall
also show that the second possibility is impossible and
thus σ (S2L−3) <∞. For the second possibility, since
x(t) is a continuous function of t, there is a subset
∪∞i=1(ti, t¯i) ⊂ S2L−3 such that tf ≤ ti < t¯i ≤ ti+1,
x(ti) = dL−1, and
P∞
i=1 (t¯i − ti) =∞. Note that for
any x(t) ∈ Ωx,2L−3, only the (L−1)−th and the L−th
rules of the fuzzy system will be fired and thus
θˆ
T
(t)ξ(x(t)) = θˆL−1(t)μFL−1(x(t))+θˆL(t)μFL(x(t))
Also as Ωx,2L−3 ⊂ [0, 1] , following from Lemma 3,
we have θˆL−1(t) ≥ 0, θˆL(t) ≥ 0, and both θˆL−1(t) as
well as θˆL(t) are monotone increasing function of t.
Moreover, for x(t) ∈ Ωx,2L−3, i.e., dL−1 < x(t) ≤
γL−1, we have μFL−1(x(t)) is monotone decreasing
with 12 ≤ μFL−1(x(t)) < 1 and μFL(x(t)) is monotone
increasing with 0 < μFL(x(t)) ≤
1
2 . Now for [ti, t¯i] ,,
we have
θˆL−1(t¯i)− θˆL−1(ti) =
Z t¯i
ti
μFL−1(x(τ))x(τ)dτ
≥ μFL−1(γL−1)dL−1 (t¯i − ti)
Since θˆL−1(t) is monotone increasing, i.e.,
θˆL−1(ti+1) ≥ θˆL−1(t¯i) as ti+1 ≥ t¯i, we have
θˆL−1(ti+1)− θˆL−1(ti) ≥ θˆL−1(t¯i)− θˆL−1(ti)
≥ μFL−1(γL−1)dL−1 (t¯i − ti)
Therefore, recursively using the above inequality, one
can obtain
θˆL−1(tN+1)
≥ θˆL−1(t1) + μFL−1(γL−1)dL−1

Since μFL−1(x) is monotone decreasing in the interval£

θˆ

which contradicts the assumption that x(t¯N+1) ≥
dL−1. Therefore, we have σ (S2L−3) <∞. The above
analysis can be also applied to the case i = 2 to show
that σ (S2) <∞.
(Part iii, the other cases) The other cases can be
treated by the same methods as done in the previous
two parts except for the cases i = L − 1 and i = L.
This completes the proof. ¥
Theorem 5: Assume that f(x) is a convex function
in [0, 1] and a concave function in [−1, 0]. Then
lim
t→∞
x(t) = 0 and θˆ(t) is bounded over [0,∞) .
Proof: Note that if the fuzzy system F (x, θ) consists
of a fuzzy singleton, Mamdani product inference en-
gine, center average defuzzifier, and triangular member
ship functions, then θ∗i = f(di) for 1 ≤ i ≤ L,
F (di, θ∗) = f(di) for 1 ≤ i ≤ L, F (x, θ) is a
piecewise linear approximator of f(x) in Ωx [10]. If
f(x) is a convex function in [0, 1] , then
f(x)− ξT (x)θ∗ ≤ 0, for x ∈ [0, 1] (57)

Fig. 3. The evolution of the state x(t) in Example 1 with x(0) = 5.
cˆ2(t) are large enough such that x˙(tp) < 0 at some
time tp, with tp < 0.1 seconds, then x(t) and thus
u(t) begin to decrease and the growth of cˆ1(t) and
cˆ2(t) will slow down. At some time t1 with t1 = 0.21
seconds, x(t) hits the switching boundary x = 1− h.
After t = t1, the adaptive fuzzy controller will take
over the system. However, since the parameter vector
θˆ is not well trained yet, the system remains unstable
and the state x(t) still tries to escape away from the
switching boundary. However, when x(t¯1) = 1 at some
time t¯1, the adaptive VSS controller will be in charge
of the system and x(t) will be forced back to x(t2) = 1
at some time t2. Until the parameter vector θˆ, actually
θˆ4 and mainly θˆ5, is well trained as shown in Fig. 6,
there is a continuous switching of 18 times occurred
at the boundary x = 1 − h, as observed in Fig. 3.
Within the time period of this continuous switching, the
value of the fuzzy system F (x, θˆ) evaluated at t = ti
when a switching occurs increases as i increases. When
f(x(ti))−F (x(ti), θˆ(ti)) is too large, then a switching
t = ti will be inevitable. At the end of this continuous
switching, the adaptive fuzzy control is applied again at
t = t19 = 1.85. At some time tq after t = t19, we have
f(x(tq)) < F (x(tq), θˆ(tq)) and x(t) begins to decay to
zero. When x(t) = 0, F (x(t), θˆ(t)) is still larger than
zero. Since f(x) < 0 for x < 0 in this example, and θˆ1
as well as θˆ2 have not been well trained until now, x(t)
will be pass through x = 0 and reach another boundary
x = −1. Then, adaptive VSS control takes over the
system again and another continuous switching of finite
time at x = −(1 − h) happens. After the second
continuous switching, there is no switching any more
and x(t) converges to zero asymptotically. From Fig.
5, we see that the amplitude of the control signal u(t)
of the adaptive fuzzy controller is much smaller than
that of the adaptive VSS controller. That is why we say
that the adaptive VSS control is for coarse control and
the adaptive fuzzy control is suitable for fine control.
