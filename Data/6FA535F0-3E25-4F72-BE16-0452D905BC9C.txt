Wave propagation and attenuation through an elastic porous medium containing 
two immiscible, viscous, compressible fluids 
 
Abstract 
The study of the poroelastic behavior of sedimentary materials containing two immiscible 
fluids in response to either applied stress or pore pressure change in a quasistatic limit, i.e. 
negligible second time-derivatives, is of great importance to many hydrogelogical problems, e.g. 
land subsidence caused by withdrawal of subsurface fluids.  The poroelasticity models 
developed for analyzing these problems feature partial differential equations that are coupled in 
the terms describing viscous damping and strain field.  To determine closed-form analytical 
solutions for induced volumetric strain (dilatation) of the solid framework and its interaction with 
fluid flows, the choice of normal coordinates whose transformation can be performed to decouple 
these poroelastic equations is highly desirable.  In this study, we show that normal coordinates 
for decoupling these equations are real-valued and equal to three different linear combinations of 
the dilatations of the solid and the fluids (or equivalently, three different linear combinations of 
two individual fluid pressures and solid dilatation).  In contrast to fully-saturated porous media, 
it is found that the viscous damping effect must be represented in normal coordinates in the 
presence of the second fluid.  The resulting decoupled equations representing independent 
motional modes are a Laplace equation and two diffusion equations, which can be solved 
analytically under a variety of initial and boundary conditions.  Thus, after inverse 
transformation of normal coordinates is performed, the closed-form analytical solutions for 
induced solid volumetric strain and excess pore fluid pressures can be obtained simultaneously 
from our decoupled partial differential equations.  The result of this study has been accepted for 
publication in Advances in Water Resources.

among the solid and two fluid phases is commonly postulated to be in the quasistatic limit for the 
study of consolidation type problems, i.e., acceleration (second time-derivative terms) can be 
ignored.  Thus, in the absence of external body forces, the coupled equations describing the 
diffusive behavior of an unsaturated porous medium can be reduced as:

which are also identical to Eqs. (75) - (77) of Tuncay and Corapcioglu [1997] after dropping the 
terms containing inertial force components (acceleration).  In Eqs. (1), e and ξε  (ξ =  1, 2) are 
the volumetric strains (dilatations) of the solid and two fluid phases, respectively; the subscript 
ξ  represents the two immiscible phases:  non-wetting fluid ( 1ξ = ; fluid 1) and wetting fluid 
( 2ξ = ; fluid 2), and thus the unsaturated (partially-saturated) porous medium we identify in the 
present study is designated as the one whose pore space is taken up by any pair of immiscible 
fluids, e.g. water and oil or water and air [Muraleetharan and Wei, 1999];  (i, j = 1, 2, 3) are 
elastic coefficients and their cross terms are symmetric, i.e. 
ija
ij jia a=  [Tuncay and Corapcioglu, 
1997; Lo et al., 2005].  We note in passing that Eqs. (1) may be alternatively written in terms of 
the displacement vectors of each phase as dependent variables, which instead constitute 9 coupled 
partial differential equations.  However, for determination of the excess pore fluid pressures and 
total mean stress, Eqs. (1) are indeed sufficient in the current form [Chandler and Johnson, 1981; 
Wang, 2000].  In fact, under the condition of uniaxial strain compaction typically assumed in 
hydrogeology and reservoir engineering [Gutierrez and Lewis, 2002], the uniaxial displacement 
component can be obtained directly by integrating the volumetric strain with respect to the 
deformation direction. 
On the basis of mass balance equations applied to each phase, and supplemented by a 
constitutive relation between capillary pressure and fluid saturation along with a closure relation 
for porosity change, Lo et al. [2005] generalized the Biot [1941, 1956] linear stress-strain 
relations for a saturated porous medium to an unsaturated porous medium, and showed that these 
elastic coefficients can be expressed in terms of porosity and five directly-measurable elasticity 
moduli:  the shear modulus of the porous framework, G; the bulk modulus of the porous 
framework, ; the bulk modulus of the solid phase, bK sK ; the bulk modulus of fluid phase 1,

respectively; ξη  is the dynamic shear viscosity of the fluid phase ξ ; sk  is the intrinsic 
permeability; and rk ξ  is the relative permeability of the fluid phase ξ .  We note that the 
cross-coupling caused by viscous drag between two immiscible fluids is neglected in Eqs. (1), i.e. 
, a common assumption often adopted to analyze two-phase flow through porous 
media [Dullien, 1992].

elements in these two matrices are functions of the degree of saturation and capillary pressure, 
they are taken here as their initial values prior to stress application, since an elastic medium is 
assumed to undergo very small deformations, the central problem in standard poroelasticity 
theory [Biot, 1941, 1956; Johnson, 1986].  This assumption has been widely adopted for 
analyzing the dynamic poroelastic problem of elastic wave propagation and attenuation through 
unsaturated porous media [Tuncay and Corapcioglu, 1997; Lo et al., 2005].  
 
3. Decoupling the coupled model equations 
Chandler and Johnson [1981] proposed a set of normal coordinates to decouple a simpler 
version of Eq. (7) when only one fluid is present in the pore space.  One of their normal 
coordinates corresponds to the motional mode for which the solid and fluid phases undergo 
in-phase displacements, whereas the other involves the motional mode for which the 
displacements of the solid and fluid phases are out of phase.  In analogy with the simpler 
single-fluid system, we extend their normal coordinates to a two-fluid system:

Equations (11) and (12) show that transformation of the coupled poroelastic Eqs. (1) for an 
unsaturated porous medium to the coordinates (ζ , ξ , ψ ) yields three new partial differential 
equations: 
2 0ζ∇ = ,                (14.1)

Evidently, decoupling is exact only for the normal coordinate ζ , but the normal coordinates ξ  
and ψ  remain coupled in the first time-derivative terms, which are attributed to viscous drags 
between the solid and two individual fluid phases.  We note that a viscous coupling coefficient 
does not appear in the matrix to be diagonalized in a single-fluid system [Chandler and Johnson, 
1981], so the Chandler-Johnson normal coordinates do not involve this coefficient.  However, in 
a two-fluid system, the viscous coupling coefficients 11R  and 22R  simultaneously exist in the 
matrix 1 1ZE RZ− −  in Eq. (12) after the elastic coefficient matrix E is inverted.  This implies that, 
to decouple Eqs. (1) completely, the exact normal coordinates should account for the viscous 
coupling coefficients 11R  and 22R  [also see Eqs. (19)].   
Proceeding to decouple Eqs. (14.2) and (14.3), we begin by recasting them in a matrix 
form:

where 3 4

⎡ ⎤= ⎢ ⎥∆ ⎣ ⎦
 and δ  is the unit second rank tensor.  Decoupling of Eq. (15) can be 
achieved by considering it as an eigenvalue problem for the matrix F  [3].  The resulting two 
 7
terms describing viscous damping and strain field [Tuncay and Corapcioglu, 1997; Lo et al., 
2005], which commonly need to be solved using numerical techniques.  To determine their 
closed-form analytical solutions subject to a variety of initial and boundary conditions, it is 
essential to perform a normal coordinate transformation that makes these coupled equations 
separable into partial differential equations representing independent motional modes.   
We demonstrate in the present study that the exact normal coordinates for these coupled 
poroelastic equations of unsaturated porous media are equal to three different linear combinations 
of the dilatations of the solid and the fluids (or equivalently, three different linear combinations of 
two individual fluid pressures and solid dilatation).  The resulting decoupled partial differential 
equations found are a Laplace equation [Eq. (19.1)], representing the motional mode for which all 
phases move in the same direction, and two diffusion equations [Eqs. (19.2) and (19.3)] whose 
motional modes depend on the value of ±Γ .  The normal coordinate satisfying the Laplace 
equation is proportional to elastic coefficients alone, while the other two coordinates 
corresponding to the diffusion equations are related to both viscous damping and elastic 
coefficients. 
These classical partial differential equations can be solved analytically for their normal 
coordinates (dependent variables) after suitable initial and boundary conditions are imposed.  
Since these equations are linear, the inverse transformation of these solutions provides an 
analytical method for the determination of closed-form solutions to induced solid volumetric 
strain and diffusive dissipations of pore fluid pressures.  Therefore, many engineering problems 
involving the quasistatic response of a partially-saturated poroelastic medium to either pore 
pressure drops or external loads can be accurately modeled by our decoupled Eqs. (19) [a full 
displacement formulation].
