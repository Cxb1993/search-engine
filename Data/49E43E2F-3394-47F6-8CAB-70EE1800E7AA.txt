The  2D  numerical  wave  ﬂume  and  boundary  conditions.  The  incident  surface  wave  propagates  from
the  left  and  interacts  with  the  ﬂoating  platform.  Most  of  the wave  energy  could  be dissipated  during
the  wave–structure  interaction.  Based  on natural  physics,  when  the  incident  wave  reaches  a  permeable
medium,  part of the  wave  energy  is reﬂected  backward  (reﬂected  wave)  and  part  is transferred  to  the
medium  (transmitted  wave).  Transmitted  waves  might  result  from  dispersion  of the  incident  waves.
The  incident  wave  energy  causes  structural  oscillation  which  also  causes  reﬂected  gravity  waves  and
transmitted  waves.  This complex  dynamic  mechanism  can  be  simpliﬁed  into  three  sections  which  can
then  be  solved  by the  method  of  separation  of  variables.
Highlights:   An NN-based  model  is  applied  for  a tension  leg  platform  (TLP)  system.    A  LDI  state-space
representation  is constructed.   Control  performance  is  achieved  by  using  the  PDC  scheme  to ensure
the stability  of  TLP  systems.   A  simulation  example  based  on  practical  data  is given.    The  numerical
experiments  indicate  the  efﬁciency  and  robustness  of  the  proposed  NN  based  approach.
Abstract:  Although  there  are  many  successful  applications  of  neural  networks  (NNs),  however,  there  are
still some  drawbacks  in using  neural  networks  (NNs)  in  any  control  scheme.  In  this  study  an  NN-based
model  is  applied  for a tension  leg  platform  (TLP)  system.  A  linear  differential  inclusion  (LDI)  state-space
representation  is  constructed  to represent  the  dynamics  of  the NN model.  Control  performance  is achieved
by using  the  parallel  distributed  compensation  (PDC)  scheme  to  ensure  the  stability  of  TLP systems
subjected  to  an  external  wave  force.  In  terms  of  the  stability  analysis,  the  linear  matrix  inequality  (LMI)
conditions  are  derived  using  the  Lyapunov  theory  to guarantee  the  robustness  design  and  stability  of  the
TLP system.  A simulation  example  based  on  practical  data  is  given  to demonstrate  the feasibility  of  the
proposed  fuzzy  control  approach.  In the  end,  we  discuss  a  practical  application  with  ﬁeld  data  on the
wave  properties  and  structural  characteristics.  The  results  indicate  the  efﬁciency  and robustness  of the
proposed  NN  based  approach.

the control systems of two nonlinear chemical reactors used as135
examples. In addition, a framework for the automatic synthesis of136
hybrid fuzzy/numerical controllers is proposed by Magazzeni [19].137
The methodology is based on model checking and on a very pre-138
cise analysis of a system. This allows one to synthesize optimal139
numerical controllers and then use them to consistently improve140
fuzzy controllers. Babaei et al. [20] tried to exploit the advantages141
of both methods, by combining a classic controller for the princi-142
pal section of the autopilot with a fuzzy logic controller to increase143
the robustness in a single loop scheme. The multi-objective genetic144
algorithm is used to mechanize the optimal determination of fuzzy145
logic controller parameters, based on an efﬁcient cost function146
that includes undershoot, overshoot, rise time, settling time, steady147
state error and stability. Aloui et al. [21] developed a method for sta-148
ble adaptive fuzzy sliding mode based tracking control for a class149
of nonlinear MIMO systems that are represented by input output150
models involving system uncertainties and external disturbances.151
The main advantage of the proposed method is that the structure of152
the controller system is partially unknown and does not require the153
bounds of uncertainties and disturbances to be known. Moghad-154
dam et al. [22], proposed a decoupled sliding-mode neural network155
variable-bound (DSMNNVB) control system to control rotating stall156
and surge in jet engine compression systems in the presence of157
disturbances and uncertainty. The control objective is to drive the158
system state to the original equilibrium point. Their results prove159
that the control system is asymptotically stable. In their controller,160
an adaptive neural network (NN) control scheme is employed for161
controlling the unknown dynamics of a nonlinear plant without162
requiring a model of the plant.163
In addition to the extension of the Lyapunov functions to the sta-164
bility issues encountered in T–S type systems, which is necessary165
in order to avoid conservatism of stability and stabilization prob-166
lems, increasing attention is also being paid to system modeling167
such as neural networks. In the past few years, NN-based modeling168
has become an active research ﬁeld often used to deal with iden-169
tiﬁcation and control problems (see [23–25],  and the references170
therein). Tanaka [24] and, Limanond and Si [25] employed a linear171
differential inclusion (LDI) state-space representation to analyze172
the stability of NN models. Although there are many successful173
applications of NNs, however, there are still some drawbacks in174
using neural networks (NNs) in any control scheme. Most notably,175
guaranteeing stability for practical controlled systems becomes a176
major problem. Recently, a class of NNs that admit LDI-based fuzzy177
representation has been proposed and used in stability analysis via 178
a Lyapunov function method (see [26] and the references therein). 179
In this current investigation, a fuzzy NN-based approach is pro- 180
posed for the stability and stabilization analysis of TLPs subjected 181
to external disturbances. That is to say, a fuzzy control technique 182
as well as a NN model is proposed to deal with the stability prob- 183
lem of TLPs. A suitable mathematical model of the TLP system and 184
the interaction between a deformable ﬂoating structure and sur- 185
face wave motion are discussed by virtue of a partial differential 186
equation as well as fuzzy logic theory. In particular, a set of PDC 187
fuzzy controllers on a platform are considered given the effects 188
of dragged surge vibration of the TLP system and the interaction 189
between waves and the structure. The purpose of this study is to 190
carry out stability analysis and to examine the inﬂuence of the fuzzy 191
controller on platform motion. The true behavior of the deformable 192
TLP is included in the solution. Along with the solution, which is 193
presented as a comparison of the responses between the platform 194
with and without fuzzy controllers, the inﬂuences of parameters 195
on the ﬂoating structure, the water wave and the fuzzy controller 196
system are also studied. 197

2.1. Tension leg platform system 200
Fig. 1 shows the 2D numerical wave ﬂume and boundary con- 201
ditions. The incident surface wave propagates from the left and 202
interacts with the ﬂoating platform. Most of the wave energy could 203
be dissipated during the wave–structure interaction. Based on nat- 204
ural physics, when the incident wave reaches a permeable medium, 205
part of the wave energy is reﬂected backward (reﬂected wave) 206
and part is transferred to the medium (transmitted wave). Trans- 207
mitted waves might result from dispersion of the incident waves. 208
The incident wave energy causes structural oscillation which also 209
causes reﬂected gravity waves and transmitted waves. This com- 210
plex dynamic mechanism can be simpliﬁed into three sections 211
which can then be solved by the method of separation of variables. 212

Finally, based on Eq. (7),  the dynamics of the NN model (10) can275
be rewritten as the following LDI state-space representation:276
X˙(t) =
∑
i=1
hi(t)Ei(t), (11)277
where hi(t) ≥ 0,
∑
i=1
hi(t) = 1,  is a positive integer and Ei is a con-278
stant matrix with appropriate dimension associated with E˝ . The279
LDI state-space representation (11) can be further rearranged as280
follows:281
X˙(t) =
∑
i=1
hi(t){AiX(t) + BiU(t)}, (12)282
where Ai and Bi are the partitions of Ei corresponding to the parti-283
tion (t).284
2.4. PDC design of TLP systems285
The momentum equation can be obtained from the motion of286
the ﬂoating structure. That is derived from Newton’s second law287
extensively. Assume that the momentum equation of a TLP sys-288
tem controlled by actuators can be characterized by the following289
differential equation:290
M ¨¯X(t) = B¯U(t) − Mr¯(t), (13)291
where X¯(t) = [x¯1(t), x¯2(t)· · ·x¯n(t)] ∈ Rn is an n-vector; ¨¯X(t), ˙¯X(t), X¯(t)292
are the acceleration, velocity, and displacement vectors, respec-293
tively; B¯ is a (n × m) matrix denoting the locations of m control294
forces; U(t) corresponds to the actuator forces (for example, gener-295
ated via the active tendon system or an active mass damper). This296
is only a static model, and Mr¯(t) is a wave-induced external force297
which can be expressed as298
Mr¯(t) = Fwx − FTX , (14)299
where Fwx is the horizontal wave force acting on the both sides of300
the structure; and FTx is the horizontal component of the static (or301
the pre-tensioned) tension applied by the tension legs. The static 302
tension is given by FTx = f	. 303
To ensure the stability of the TLP system, the PDC concept is 304
employed in the design to determine the structures of the fuzzy 305
controllers. The fuzzy controller appears in the following form: 306
Controller Rule i : IF x1(t) is Mi1 and · · · and xg (t) is Mig
THEN U(t) = −KiX(t), (i = 1, 2, · · ·, r)
, (15) 307
where Ki is the local feedback gain vector in the ith subspace. The 308
ﬁnal model-based fuzzy controller is analytically represented by 309
U(t) = −
∑r
i=1wi(t)KiX(t)∑r
i=1wi(t)
= −
r∑
i=1
hi(t)KiX(t). (16) 310
The overall closed-loop controlled system is as follows: 311
X˙(t) =
r∑
i=1
r∑
l=1
hi(t)hl(t)[(Ai − BiKl)X(t)] + Ei(t). (17) 312
Below the linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions are derived 313
from Lyapunov theory to check the stability of T–S fuzzy systems. 314
Given an LMI  F(x) > 0, the LMI  problem is to ﬁnd xfeas such that 315
F(xfeas) > 0 or determine that the LMI  is infeasible. This is a convex 316
feasibility problem. An LMI  deﬁnition is clearly described in Lu et al. 317
[16] and Boyd et al. [27]. 318
Before a typical stability condition for TLP system is proposed, 319
some useful concepts are given below: 320
Lemma  1 ([32]). For any A, B ∈ Rn and for any symmetric positive 321
deﬁnite matrix G ∈ Rn×n or R, we have 322
−2ATB ≤ ATGA + BTG−1B. (18) 323
Lemma  2 ([28]). The equilibrium point of closed-loop fuzzy system 324
X˙(t) =
r∑
i=1
r∑
l=1
hi(t)hl(t){(Ai − BiFl)X(t)} is asymptotically stable in the 325
large if there exists a common positive deﬁnite matrix P such that 326
(Ai − BiKl)TP + P(Ai − BiKl) < 0 for P = PT > 0, and 327
i, l = 1, 2, · · ·,  r. (19) 328
329
Lemma  3 ([29]). Consider the following H∞ control performance to 330
attenuate the inﬂuence of the excitation (t) on the state variable X(t). 331
332∫ tf
0
X(t)TQX(t) dt ≤ 
2
∫ tf
0
(t)T(t) dt 333
where tf denotes the terminal time of the control; 
 is a prescribed value 334
which denotes the effect of (t) on X(t); and Q is a positive deﬁnite 335
weighting matrix. If the initial condition is considered,  Lemma  3 can 336
also be written as follows: 337∫ tf
0
X(t)TQX(t) dt ≤ X(0)TPX(0) + 
2
∫ tf
0
(t)T(t) dt, (20) 338
where P are some positive deﬁnite matrices. 339

研究報告，報告過程流暢且研究內容精彩，受到在場許多學者們的肯定，劉峰瑞教授
主講的主題是『Health Risk Assessment for Sewer Workers using Bayesian Belief 
Networks』，劉峰瑞教授同時也兼研發處的行政工作，並且給予本人許多研發新意及
思考。另外出席的國內學者也有元培大學的徐寶鵬教授，主講的主題是『Estimating the 
Influences of Financial Crisis and Diversification on Efficiencies for Taiwan’s Listed 
Securities Firms using the Two-Stage DEA Model』，徐教授是國內清華大學數學系畢業
後再攻讀清華大學經濟所，博士轉往政治大學財經所完成博士學位，徐教授教導我許
多偏微分方程的模式推倒以及統計方法等等，未來我們必定有更多的研究合作。另外
出席的國內學者也有國北師資科系的游象輔教授，主講的主題是『Segment-based 
Streaming Cache of Two Layers』，游教授是中央大學的資工博士，他從建國中學畢業
後就一直在中央大學求學，我也向他學習到許多軟計算的原理。 
第二天(9/29)我在會場，仍然是遇到許多的專家學者積極討論他們的研究主題，我也
給予許多寶貴意見，例如來自 National Institute of Technology Raipur 的 Dr. Dilip Singh 
Sisodia & Dr. Shrish Verma 『Image Pixel Intensity and Artificial Neural Network based 
Method for Pattern Recognition』，他們提出一個方法 for pattern recognition which is 
based on Multilayer Error Back propagation network trained with sigmoidal or any 
continuous and differentiable function with pixel intensity based technique，因為 Dr. Dilip 
Singh Sisodia & Dr. Shrish Verma 使用 Artificial Neural Networks 做影像的精確辨識，未
來似乎也能更針對模糊數的取決，來做更多改善的研究主題，而且我們也在用餐時談
到未來合作的詳細方式，此外也跟其他大學的學者們，討論到更多有趣的研究主題，
例如，去年我遇到中國的北京大學數學系張占利博士，討論到控制法的應用，也提到
即將來臨的十月底研討會，我會再度到北京拜訪他們的研究團隊，並且討論進一步的
數學推導，而且張占利博士也表示非常歡迎，也互相留下聯絡資訊，等待隨時的聯繫
與合作，果然在去年的十月前往北京，並且深入地討論到控制器的研發與推倒，此外
我們也聊到許多研究生涯規劃，並且獲知張占利博士獲得北京大學的博士後就留在北
京中央財經大學任職，這些深入的討論及生涯的規劃使我獲益良多，對國科會的經費
贊助之用心，再度表示感激。 
第三天(9/30) 我在會場也是遇到許多的專家學者積極討論他們的研究主題，我也給予
他學者與同輩的意見與回饋。第二、希望到國外的場合，報告我們國內的研究，與國
外的學者交流。幸運的是，這兩個目的在此行均有達到。在會議中，他們對於我的研
究提出了一些問題。這些問題主要是包括研究主題的選擇及應用層面。 
最後還有一點學習是與論文本身較不直接的，那就是體驗到外國人進行會議的方式，
並讓我觀察到在議程進行的各個階段，各種不同的交流形式是如何發生與變化。
