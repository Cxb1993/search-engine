deterioration can not be ignored. To accommodate more practical features of the real inventory
systems, Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995) and Hwang and Shinn (1997) extended Goyal’s (1985) model to
consider the deterministic inventory model with a constant deterioration rate. Since the occurrence
of shortages in inventory is a very nature phenomenon in real situations, Jamal et al. (1997), Sarker
et al. (2000), Chang and Dye (2000) and Chang et al. (2002) extended Aggarwal and Jaggi’s (1995)
model to allow for shortages and makes it more applicable in real world. Chang et al. (2003) then
extended Teng’s (2002) model, and established an EOQ model for deteriorating items in which
the supplier provides a permissible delay to the purchaser if the order quantity is greater than or
equal to a predetermined quantity. By considering the diﬀerence between unit selling price and
unit purchasing cost, Ouyang et al. (2004) developed an EOQ model with noninstantaneous receipt
under conditions of permissible delay in payments. Recently, Taso and Sheen (2007) developed a
ﬁnite time horizon inventory model for deteriorating items to determine the most suitable retail
price and appropriate replenishment cycle time with ﬂuctuating unit purchasing cost and trade
credit. Chang et al. (2009) established an inventory model to determine the optimal payment time,
replenishment cycle and order quantity under inﬂation.
However, all the above models make an implicit assumption that the demand rate is constant
over an inﬁnite planning horizon. This assumption is only valid during the maturity phase of a
product life cycle. During the introduction and growth phase of a product life cycle, the ﬁrms face
increasing demand with little competition. Some researchers (Resh et al. (1976), Donaldson (1977),
Dave and Patel (1981), Sachan (1984), Goswami and Chaudhuri (1991), Goyal et al. (1992) and
Chakrabarty et al. (1998)) suggest that the demand rate can be well approximated by a linear form.
A linear trend demand implies an uniform change in the demand rate of the product per unit time.
This is a fairly unrealistic phenomenon and it seldom occurs in the real market. One can usually
observe in the electronic market that the sales of items increase rapidly during the introduction
and growth phase of the life cycle because there are few competitors in market. Recently, Yang et
al. (2002) established an optimal replenishment policy for power-form demand rate and proposed
a simple and computationally eﬃcient method in a forward recursive manner to ﬁnd the optimal
replenishment strategy. Khanra and Chaudhuri (2003) advise that the demand rate should be
represented by a continuous quadratic function of time in the growth stage of a product life cycle.
They also provide a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem when the planning horizon is ﬁnite. To
achieve maximum proﬁt, Chen and Chen (2004) presented an inventory model for a deteriorating
item with a multivariate demand function of price and time. Their model is solved with dynamic
programming techniques by adjusting the selling price upward or downward periodically. Chen et
al. (2007a; 2007b) dealt with the inventory model under the demand function following the product-

Ir = interest charges which are invested in inventory, $/year.
M = the retailer’s trade credit period oﬀered by supplier in years.
N = the customer’s trade credit period oﬀered by retailer in years, where N ≤M .
n = the number of replenishment periods during the planning horizon.
ti = the ith replenishment time (a decision variable), i = 1, 2, ..., n, with 0 = t0 < t1 <
t2 < · · · < tn = H.
Ti = the length of ith replenishment period.
Qi = the order quantity in the ith replenishment period.
TP (n, p, t) = the present value of total proﬁt, where t = {t1, t2, . . . , tn−1}.
2.2 Assumptions
1. The inventory system involves in only one item over a known and ﬁnite planning horizon H.
2. The replenishment occurs instantaneously at an inﬁnite rate.
3. The items deteriorate at a constant rate of deterioration θ, where 0 < θ ≪ 1. There is no
repair or replacement of deteriorated units during the planning horizon. The items will be
withdrawn from the warehouse immediately as they deteriorate.
4. Before the replenishment account is settled, the retailer can use the sales revenue to earn
interest with an annual rate Ie. However, beyond the ﬁxed credit period, the product still in
stock is presumed to be ﬁnanced with an annual rate Ir.
5. The retailer can accumulate revenue and earn interest after his/her customer pays for the
amount of purchasing cost to the retailer until the end of the trade credit period oﬀered by
the supplier. That is, the retailer can accumulate revenue and earn interest during the period
N to M with rate Ie under the condition of trade credit.

The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal replenishment points ti and the optimal
selling price to maximize the present value of total proﬁt of the inventory system. Hence, it is a
n decision-making problem for a retailer and the problem can be mathematically formulated as
follows:
Maximize TP (p, t|n)
subject to c < p ≤ pu,
ti−1 < ti, i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
t0 = 0, tn = H.
The formulated optimization model is a nonlinear programming problem with nonnegative
constraints. Since it is diﬃcult to solve analytically, we adopt an evolutionary computation al-
gorithm to solve the problem. In this paper, an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization
(PSO) is proposed to ﬁnd the optimal pricing and replenishment schedule. The algorithm is similar
to other population-based algorithms like Genetic algorithms but, there is no direct combination
of individuals of the population. Instead, it relies on the social behavior of particle. In the next
section, we will introduce how the PSO can be used to solve the problem.
6
the algorithm will check the results every iteration until the best solution is found or termination
conditions are satisﬁed.
In the PSO algorithm, velocities are clamped at each iteration to lie within [−Vmax, Vmax]
on each dimension, which is a parameter speciﬁed by the user. If the sum of accelerations causes
the velocity on that dimension to exceed Vmax, then this velocity is limited to Vmax. This helps
particles comb the search space rather than potentially take huge iterative steps that might cause
some information to be missed. Then, the search procedure of the particle swarm optimization is
summarized as follows:
Step 1 Initialize I particles with random positions and velocities on d-dimensions in the search
space, where I is the number of particles.
Step 2 Evaluate the ﬁtness of all particles.
Step 3 Keep track of the locations where each individual had its highest ﬁtness so far.
Step 4 Keep track of the position with the global best ﬁtness.
Step 5 Update the velocity of each particle, according to (7) and (9).
Step 6 Update the position of each particle, according to (8).
Step 7 Terminate if the standard deviation of ﬁtness is less than ϵ (e.g. 10−5) or the maximum
number of iterations (e.g. 1000) is reached, otherwise go to Step 2.
4.2 Solving the pricing and replenishment scheduling problem
For any given feasible replenishment schedule, 0 = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn−1 < tn = H, to
acquire optimal selling price that maximizes TP (p|n, t), the value of p∗ should be selected to satisfy
dTP (p|n, t)

and

respectively.
Since α′(p) < 0 and α′′(p) > 0, it is clear from (11), (13) and (15) that dTP (p|n, t)/dp = 0
has a solution if α(p) + pα′(p) < 0 (see Appendix B for details). Further, if the marginal revenue
with respect to selling price is decreasing (i.e. pα(p) is a strictly concave function of p), it can be
easily veriﬁed that
d2TP (p|n, t)

i=1
{
SRi − PCi −HCi + IEi − ICi −Ae−rti−1

< 0,
from (12), (14) and (16) (see Appendix C for details). Consequently, TP (p|n, t) is a strictly concave
function of p, and there exits a unique solution that maximizes TP (p|n, t). From this, we can obtain
the following result: once t is known, the optimal selling price, p∗, can be uniquely determined as
a function of t. Thus, p∗ = popt(t) can be written as a function of t. This results reduces the n
dimensional problem of ﬁnding the optimal pricing and schedule to a n− 1 dimensional problem as
follows:
Maximize TP (t|n)
subject to c < popt(t) ≤ pu,
ti−1 < ti, i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
t0 = 0, tn = H.
Note that if marginal revenue is an increasing function of p, then selling price and revenue
will always move in the same direction, hence the retailer can realize an inﬁnite proﬁt by setting an
inﬁnite p. It is impossible.
10
Step 8 Update xik+1, i = 1, 2, . . . , I, according to (8).
Step 9 Terminate if the standard deviation of φ(xk|n) < 10−5 or k = itermax, otherwise k =
k + 1 and go to Step 4.
Let n∗ be the optimal replenishment number. To avoid using a brute force enumeration for
ﬁnding n∗, we further simplify the search process by providing an intuitively good starting value
for n∗. Because α′(p) < 0, it is easy to see that dTP (p|n, t)/dp = 0 has a solution if and only if
α(p)+ pα′(p) < 0. Since marginal revenue, α (p)+ pα′ (p), is a strictly decreasing function of p, the
solution of α (p)+pα′ (p) = 0, say pl, is the lower bound for the optimal selling price. Moreover, the
holding cost per unit (including inventory and deterioration costs) is h+ Irc+ θc. Substituting the
above results into classical EOQ foumula, we obtain an estimate of the number of replenishments
as
n = round integer of
√
(h+ Irc+ θc)H
∫ H
0 α(pl)f(t) dt
2A
. (19)
It is obvious that searching for the optimal number of replenishments by starting with n in
(19) instead of n = 1 will reduce the computational complexity signiﬁcantly. Combining the above
arguments, we propose the following algorithm to solve the pricing and replenishment scheduling
problem.
Algorithm 2
Step 1 Choose two initial trial values of n∗, say n as in (19) and n + 1. Use Algorithm 1 to
obtain {t∗i }, and compute the corresponding TP (n) and TP (n+ 1), respectively.
Step 2 If TP (n) ≤ TP (n+1), then compute TP (n+2), TP (n+3), . . . , until we ﬁnd TP (k) >
TP (k + 1). Set n∗ = k and stop.
Step 3 If TP (n) > TP (n+1), then compute TP (n−1), TP (n−2), . . . , until we ﬁnd TP (k) >
TP (k − 1). Set n∗ = k and stop.
12
α(p) = 100− 3p f (t) = 25 + 10t+ t2 θ = 0.08
A = 50 h = 2 c = 10
H = 1 r = 0.2 Ir = 0.18
Ie = 0.12 M = 45/365 N = 15/365
Solving α(p)+pα′(p) = 0 ﬁrst, we obtain pl = 16.6667 and the estimated number of replenishments
n = 8 from (19). Then, applying the Algorithm 1 and 2, we get TP (8) = 10572.5, TP (9) = 10575.3
and TP (10) = 10571.5. Therefore, the optimal number of replenishments is 9 and the corresponding
optimal selling price is 21.7811. The optimum solution found after 151 iterations (61.494 seconds).
The optimal time schedule is shown in Table 2. The behavior of the inventory system over the
planning horizon and the convergence result of PSO algorithm for the optimal solution are depicted
in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.
[Table 2 about here.]
[Figure 4 about here.]
[Figure 5 about here.]
Example 3. In this example, we redo an inventory situation proposed by Chen and Chen (2004)
while considering the trade credit ﬁnancing:
α(p) = 300− 120p f (t) = e−0.06t θ = 0.2
A = 40 h = 0.02 c = 1
H = 12 r = 0.02 Ir = 0.18/12
Ie = 0.12/12 M = 3/2 N = 1
Note that the time unit is one month. The planning horizon is one year, which equals to 12 months.
By applying (19), we obtain the estimated number of replenishments n = 7. Then, applying the
Algorithm 1 and 2, we get TP (8) = 105.7, TP (7) = 122.4, TP (6) = 133.1, TP (5) = 133.7 and
TP (4) = 116.9. Therefore, the optimal number of replenishments is 5 and the corresponding
optimal selling price is 1.9150. The optimum solution found after 141 iterations (24.095 seconds).
The optimal time schedule is shown in Table 3. The behavior of the inventory system over the
planning horizon and the convergence result of PSO algorithm for the optimal solution are depicted
in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.

3. The net present value of the total proﬁt is more sensitive on the change in c, h, r and θ. It
implies that the eﬀects of c, h, r and θ on the discounted total proﬁt are signiﬁcant.
4. The eﬀect of varying M and Ie is negative correlated with varying N and Ic.
5. Large variation in the input parameters hardly have an eﬀect on the value of the number of
orders made in most cases. This implies that the algorithm developed in the paper is robust.
6 Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we consider a retailer’s optimal pricing and lot-sizing problem for deteriorating
items with ﬂuctuating demand under trade credit ﬁnancing. We have successfully formulated the
problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and proposed a solution algorithm asso-
ciated with it. In contrast to the classical ﬁxed selling price policy under trade credit, the pricing
policy in this model provides more ﬂexibity by changing price upward or downward. Consequently,
the model is ideal for managers to design marketing strategies to stay ahead of the challenges their
products are likely to face. Furthermore, the PSO algorithm is selected in this paper because of its
robustness, simplicity and ease of implementation. The computational results indicated that the
PSO algorithm oﬀers acceptable eﬃciency and accurate search capability.
The proposed model can be extended in several ways. For instance, we may generalize the
model to allow for shortages, quantity discounts and capacity constraint of owned warehouse. Also,
we could extend the deterministic demand function to stochastic demand patterns. Finally, we
could extend the sales environment to an advance booking system.

Case 1: N < M ≤ ti − ti−1
In this case, since the length of replenishment period is larger than the credit period, the
retailer can continue to accumulate revenue and earn interest with an annual rate Ie on it. Hence, the
present value of the interest earned in the ith replenishment period, denoted by IEi1, i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
is
