Abstract1
A study in laser-induced implantation of 
silver particles for fabrication of embedded 
electronic interconnects is reported. Direct 
implantations of silver particles, vaporized by a 
pulsed laser from a silver film initially 
pre-coated on a transparent glass substrate, into 
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-encapsulated organic 
electronic devices as electronic conducting 
circuits are demonstrated. Two test carriers are 
the devices of organic thin-film transistors and 
polymeric light-emitting diodes. Device property 
characterizations indicate the implanted circuits 
can work smoothly. Due to its flexibility in 
embedding metals into an encapsulated device, 
this approach can be used for repairing internal 
circuit damage. Besides, all steps can be 
executed in the ambient environment and at 
room temperature that is suitable for plastic 
substrate processing.

1. Introduction 
Since its discovery in the 1960s, laser has 
been regarded as a powerful tool for material 
processing. Extensive works on laser-assisted 
deposition, doping, and etching of materials 
related to integrated circuit technology have 
been reported. Among theses, laser-induced 
forward transfer (LIFT) technique, first 
introduced by Bohandy et al [1] for depositing 
50-µm-wide copper lines using excimer laser 
under high vacuum, has been developed as a 
promising direct-write method for the defined 
microdeposition of metals, biomaterials, organic 
materials, or carbon nanotubes [2-8]. In addition 
to the film-deposition application that places 
transfer material on target surface, LIFT-based 
material transfer technique is also applicable to 
implantation of source materials into target films 
[9-16]. 
Recently, organic electronics have attracted 
considerable research interests due to their 
promising potentials for low-cost applications 
such as larger area flat panel displays, disposable 
electronics, or flexible electronics. However, 
electronic properties of organic devices are 
easily degraded by oxygen and moisture. An 
effective encapsulation is thus crucial for organic 
electronics. Motivated by increasing 
device-encapsulation flexibility, here the 
feasibility of embedding metallic particles into 
already-encapsulated organic thin-film 
transistors (OTFTs) and polymeric light-emitting 
diodes (PLEDs) as conducting circuits by 
laser-induced implantation is investigated. 
2. Experiment 
In this study, the method of laser induced 
implantation was employed to implant silver 
particles into a passivation layer on 
 4
around 12 nm that is much smaller than the 
thickness of the silver film (300 nm). Thus, as 
the laser irradiation propagates toward to the 
support, except for the very small portion of 
energies that are reflected and absorbed by the 
transparent glass, the main energy that transmits 
to the transparent glass support is absorbed by 
the silver film. This immediate energy 
absorption rapidly increases the temperature rise 
of the silver film and causes the silver to change 
its phases from solid to vapor. The instantly 
evaporation provides a thrust to eject the 
high-temperature vaporized particles in a 
rocket-like motion toward the target at high 
speed.  
Once their arrivals on the PVA surface, the 
ejected particles softened and melted the PVA 
film locally owing to their high temperature and 
penetrate into the passivation layer due to their 
high momentum. The embedded particles were 
kept cooling down and decelerated as they 
moved inside the target layer and stopped 
motions until their momentum were totally lost. 
The subsequent laser pulses repeated the heating 
and penetrating processes and kept pushing the 
previous embedded particles forwardly step by 
step. However, with the number of the embedded 
particles increased, the growing rate of 
penetration depth decreased because both the 
inertia and viscous drag were enhanced that 
eventually resulted in a saturation of the 
penetration depth. 
The feasibility of fabricating electronic 
circuits for an already-encapsulated organic 
electronic device by laser-induced implantation 
is now examined and discussed. Figure 4 
demonstrates the device characteristics for two 
fabricated P3HT-based organic thin-film 
transistors: the one before encapsulation for Fig. 
4(a); and, the one after encapsulating with PVA 
passivation layer and with interconnects 
fabricated using laser-induced implantation for 
Fig. 4(b). The device was with channel length of 
30 µm and width of 1 mm. Fig. 4(a) shows the 
resulting on-off ratio (Ion/off) was about 102 
under the gate voltage span between -40 to 0 V 
and the drain voltage of -60 V. These 
characteristics were comparable to those organic 
devices reported in the literature [17-19]. In 
addition to a little bit reduction in the 
source/drain currents (Ids), Fig. 4(b) shows the 
principal device characteristics and the on/off 
ratio that revealed in Fig. 4(a) were reserved. 
The mobility was reduced from 4.49×10-3 
cm2/Vs for Fig. 4(a) to 2.95×10-3 cm2/Vs for Fig. 
4(b). The potential reasons for this mobility 
reduction were conjectured due to the possible 
interface deformation between polymer 
semiconductor and the source/drain electrodes or 
owing to additional traps at contact interfaces 
between the gold electrode and the silver 
interconnects that were introduced during the 
laser implantation process.  
The device performance of the encapsulated 
PLED with laser-implanted interconnect was 
characterized. Fig. 5(a) showed the operating i-v 
curve. The turn-on voltage was at 7V that 
corresponded to a turn-on current of 9.02×10-4 A 
and the device broke down at a voltage of 24 V. 
These characteristics again deviated very little 
from those before encapsulation. Fig. 5(b) shows 
the PLED using laser-implanted interconnects 
still exhibits a good uniformity of 
electro-luminescence. 
In addition to the device’s electronic 
properties, the resulting surface morphology of 
the passivation layer is another angle to examine 
the present approach. Figure 6(a) is a top-view 
SEM image showing both areas of PVA and 
silver interconnect after the implantation process. 
The PVA/silver interface can be identified and 
the surface morphology is well preserved. The 
surface profile, measured a stylus surface 
profiler and shown in Fig. 6(b), indicts that the
