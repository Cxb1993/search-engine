addition to the singular orders one is always 
interested to know their associated stress intensity 
factors of interface corners.  
Although several detailed studies have been 
done about the determination of the associated 
singular orders and stress intensity factors for 
interface corners, very few failure criteria were 
successfully established based upon these 
parameters. Even the cracks in homogeneous 
media or the cracks lying along the interface 
between dissimilar materials are the special cases 
of the interface corners, the definitions of stress 
intensity factors proposed in the literature are 
usually not consistent with that of cracks. 
Therefore, to have a universal failure criterion for 
the homogeneous cracks, interface cracks and 
interface corners, a unified definition for the stress 
intensity factors is indispensable. In the literature 
the stress intensity factors of interface corners are 
usually defined by the way similar to the 
homogeneous cracks, e.g., (Sinclair, et al., 1984; 
Dunn, et al., 1997), which may encounter trouble 
when the stress distributions near the interface 
corners exhibit the oscillatory characteristics like 
the interface cracks discussed in (Rice, 1988; Wu, 
1990; Suo, 1990; Gao, et al., 1992; Hwu, 1993). 
Thus, even for the interface cracks some 
definitions of their stress intensity factors proposed 
in the literature are not compatible with the 
conventional definitions for homogeneous cracks. 
To build a direct connection among the 
homogeneous cracks, interface cracks and 
interface corners, in this project a unified 
definition for the stress intensity factors is 
proposed. 
 By the definition of the stress intensity 
factors proposed in this project, to calculate their 
values we need to know the stresses near the tip of 
interface corners. By employing the Stroh 
formalism for anisotropic elasticity (Ting, 1996), 
the near tip solutions for elastic composite wedges 
have been obtained analytically (Hwu, et al., 2003). 
Moreover, consideration of the thermal effects, the 
solutions for the temperature, heat flux, 
displacement and stress in the field near the apex 
of multibonded anisotropic wedges are also 
obtained (Hwu and Lee, 2004). Based upon the 
analytical solutions obtained from (Hwu and Lee, 
2004), in this report the near tip solutions for the 
general interface corners are divided into five 
different categories depending on whether the 
singular order is distinct or repeated, real or 
complex. However, due to the singular and 
possibly oscillatory behaviors of the near tip 
solutions, it is not easy to get convergent values 
for the stress intensity factors directly from the 
definition. To overcome this problem, a 
path-independent integral will be considered in our 
follow-up project.  
 
2. Near tip solutions for interface corners 
To study the singular behavior of interface 
corners and to provide a proper definition for their 
associated stress intensity factors, like the concept 
of fracture mechanics it is important to know the 
near tip solutions. By employing Stroh formalism 
for anisotropic elasticity, the near tip solutions for 
multi-bonded anisotropic wedges have been 
obtained as (Hwu, et al., 2003; Hwu and Lee, 
2004)

3. A unified definition for stress intensity 
factors 
It is known that a semi-infinite crack in 
homogeneous materials can be represented by 
letting  0  and  1  for a single wedge. 
Moreover, an interface crack can be represented by 
a bi-wedge with  0 , 01   and  2 . 
These two important special cases indicate that to 
propose a proper definition for the stress intensity 
factors of interface corners, it is better to review 
the corresponding definition for the crack 
problems. 
A conventional definition for the stress 
intensity factors k of a crack in homogeneous 
media is (Broek, 1974)

in which the third equality of (11) comes from the

stresses near the tip of interface cracks, this 
definition cannot be applied to the cracks lying on 
the bimaterial interface. A proper definition for the 
bimaterial stress intensity factors has been given 
by Hwu (1993) as

its phase angle. In application, the reference length 
  is usually selected to be the crack length. 
Combining (11) and (12), and considering 
the consistence of definitions, we now propose a 
unified definition for the stress intensity factors of 
interface corners, which is also applicable for the 
cracks in homogeneous materials or bimaterial

Abstract 
In the first year’s study, a unified definition for the stress intensity factors was 
proposed for the general interface corners. Through this unified definition, a direct 
connection between homogenous cracks, interface cracks, homogeneous corners ad 
interface corners has been built. To provide a stable and efficient computing approach for 
the general mixed-mode stress intensity factors, the path-independent H-integral based on 
reciprocal theorem of Betti and Rayleigh is established in this year’s project. The 
complementary solutions needed for calculation of H-integral are provided in this study. 
To illustrate our results, several different kinds of examples are shown such as cracks in 
homogenous isotropic or anisotropic materials, central or edge notches in isotropic 
materials, interface cracks and interface corners between two dissimilar materials.

0  and terminates on n  in counterclockwise direction.  
By shrinking the inner path C  inside the region dominated by the singular field and 
making a judicious choice for the complementary solution, we can get an analytical 
expression for the H-integral in terms of the coefficients ic  (or simply c) which have a 
direct relation with the stress intensity factors. Thus, if one can evaluate the H-integral 
from the other path far from the tip, through the path-independent property shown in (3) 
we can calculate the stress intensity factors. With this understanding, we will now try to 
find the suitable complementary solutions and then derive formulae for the stress 
intensity factors. 
Since the integral path can be selected arbitrarily from the lower wedge flank 0  to 
upper wedge flank n , for simplicity we choose a circular counterclockwise path through 
the region dominated by the singular field. Along this path, the traction r/,t and

2. Numerical Examples 
The computation of stress singular orders and their associated stress intensity factors 
through H-integral has been introduced in our first two years’ report and will not be 
repeated here. To show that the proposed approach is valid for any different kinds of 
cracks and corners, four examples are illustrated in this report. They are: a center crack in 
a homogeneous anisotropic material, a center corner in a homogeneous anisotropic 
material, an interface crack between two dissimilar anisotropic materials, an interface 
corner between two dissimilar anisotropic materials. Although some typical problems of 
interface cracks/corners have been presented in the second year of the project, for the 
purpose of comparison most of the examples done in the second year are calculated for 
isotropic materials. To show that the formulae and their associated solution techniques 
are valid for any kinds of anisotropic materials, here we like to extend the examples to 
the general anisotropic materials. Moreover, to study the connection between cracks, 
corners, interface cracks and interface corners, a particular problem is designed in Figure 
1. From this Figure, we see that when 0   the corner problems will be reduced to 
crack problems, and when material 1 and material 2 are chosen to be the same material 
 25
= 0.178 MPa m,    = 0.000107 MPa m,    0.I II IIIK K K             
It can easily be seen that all these values agree very well with the analytical solutions 
provided in the literature. 
 
Example 2: a center corner in a homogeneous anisotropic material  
In this example, the center corner is represented by letting 030   in Figure 1 and 
all the other geometrical and material properties are the same as Example 1. By using the 
same formulae and solution techniques as center cracks stated in Example 1, the singular 
orders and stress intensity factors of this problem are calculated as 
0.478 0.478
0.478,    
= 0.254 MPa m ,    = 0.104 MPa m ,    0.I II IIIK K K
 
           
Through this result, we see that both of IK  and IIK  increase due to the change from 
crack to corner when they are compared under different units.  
 
Example 3: an interface crack between two dissimilar materials 
In this example, material 2 has the same properties as the orthotropic material 
mentioned in example 1 with 030  , while material 1 is chosen to be an isotropic one 
which possess Young’s modulus 10GPaE   and Poisson’s ratio 0.2  . All the other 
geometrical and material properties are the same as example 1. The reference length used 
in the definition of stress intensity factor is selected to be half of the crack length, i.e., 
0.01m . 
Again through the same solution techniques, the singular orders and stress intensity 
factors of this problem are calculated as 
0.5 0.063 ,
= 0.180 MPa m,    = 0.024MPa m,    0.I II III
i
K K K
  
  
which agree with the analytical solutions provided in the literature. Through the 
comparison with example 1, we see that both IK  and IIK  increase due to the 
difference of mechanical properties between material 1 and material 2.  
 
Example 4: an interface corner between two dissimilar materials  
Same as example 3 except that 30    for interface corner. The singular orders 
and stress intensity factors of this problem are calculated as 
0.473 0.473
0.473,    
= 0.227 MPa m ,    = 0.048MPa m ,    0.I II IIIK K K
 
     
Again, like the crack/corner in homogeneous materials, by comparison with example 3, 
we see that both of IK  and IIK  increase due to the change from crack to corner when 
they are compared under different units. However, unlike cracks in homogeneous 
materials or on the interface of bimaterials compared in examples 1 and 3, through the 
comparison with example 2, we see that both the magnitudes of IK  and IIK  decrease 
instead of increase due to the difference of mechanical properties between material 1 and 
material 2.

3. Conclusions 
In this report several different kinds of interface corner problems are solved by using 
the same formulae and solution techniques. Through the same definition, the stress 
intensity factors of interface corners and cracks which are usually defined independently 
can now be discussed and compared under the same situation set by the users. Detailed 
discussions for several different kinds of problems have been presented in our numerical 
examples, which show that our proposed approach is not only versatile but also efficient 
and accurate.

INTERFACE CORNERS IN PIEZOELECTRIC MATERIALS

Due to the widely applications of piezoelectric materials and their possible failure induced by cracks, 
several different kinds of crack problems for piezoelectric materials have been discussed in the literature. 
However, relatively few discussions have been devoted to interface corners in piezoelectric materials. 
Since the related studies for interface corners have been done successfully for anisotropic materials, here 
we like to extend this discussion to interface corners in piezoelectric materials. Due to the special feature 
of Stroh formalism, the solutions in matrix form for the piezoelectric interface corners all keep the same 
mathematical form as those of the corresponding anisotropic problems. With the help of some explicit 
expressions found recently for the fundamental piezo-elasticity matrices, the matrix form solutions can be 
further expressed in explicit component form, which are useful for observing the piezoeffects on interface 
corners. Moreover, some solutions can be specialized to cracks and interface cracks to compare with the 
existing solutions in the literature. 
 
Keywords: Interface corner, Piezoelectric material, Crack, Interface crack, Anisotropic material. 
 
1. Introduction 
Several different kinds of crack problems for 
piezoelectric materials have been discussed in the 
literature such as Refs. [1-6]. However, relatively few 
discussions have been devoted into corners in 
piezoelectric materials [7-9] and the connections 
between cracks and corners. Recently, a unified 
definition of stress intensity factor was proposed [10] to 
build a bridge connecting the failure prediction among 
the interface corners, corners, interface cracks and 
cracks. Here, we like to extend this discussion to the 
interface corners in piezoelectric materials. Since most 
of the works presented in this paper are extracted from 
our recent works [11,12], please refer to these two 
papers if something presented here are not clear enough.  
2. Piezoelectric Anisotropic Elasticity 
In a fixed rectangular coordinate system xi, i=1,2,3, 
let ui, ijσ , ijε , jD  and kE   be, respectively, the 
displacement, stress, strain, electric displacement (or 
called induction) and electric field. The constitutive 
laws, strain-displacement equations, equilibrium 
equations and the electrostatic equation for piezoelectric 
anisotropic elasticity are [14]

(3) Stress/electric intensity factors 
A proper definition of the stress intensity factors 
for interface corners in anisotropic materials has been 
proposed recently [10], which can be reduced to the 
conventional definition for cracks in homogeneous 
anisotropic materials or for cracks along the interfaces 
between two dissimilar anisotropic materials. Here, we 
extend this definition to the present cases of 
piezoelectric interface corners, which can now be 
written as

4. Numerical Examples 
Although the singular orders in composite 
piezoelectric wedges and junctions have been presented 
in the literature such as Refs. [8,9], their results leave 
the solutions to a system of simultaneous algebraic 
equations whose details are usually ignored due to 
complexity. Here, the solutions are explicitly expressed 
by the multiplication of the key matrix as those shown 
in Eq. (8). Moreover, they are exactly the same as the 
corresponding anisotropic problems [15,16]. To show 
the correctness for the present piezoelectric cases, 
comparison has been made with Ref. [8] by considering 
a piezoelectric interface corner lying between PZT-4 
and PZT-5. The material properties of PZT-4 and PZT-5 
can be found in Refs. [8,12]. The singular orders are 
shown in Fig. 2 for PZT-4 and PZT-5 junctions with 
debonded interface.  
5. Conclusions 
In this paper, by taking the advantage of Stroh 
formalism for anisotropic elasticity, without any further 
derivation several explicit solutions for the piezoelectric 
interface corners have been presented in exactly the 
same matrix forms as those of the corresponding pure 
anisotropic interface corner problems. These solutions 
include: the orders of stress/electric singularity, near tip 
solutions, and the definition of stress/electric intensity 
factors. To check the correctness of these explicit form 
solutions, numerical results for the singular orders have 
also been presented in this paper, which agree well with 
those published in the literature.

Abstract
Based upon linear fracture mechanics, it is well known that the singular order of stresses near the crack tip in homo-
geneous materials is a constant value 1/2, which is nothing to do with the material properties. For the interface cracks
between two dissimilar materials, the near tip stresses are oscillatory due to the order of singularity being 1/2 ± ie and
1/2. The oscillation index e is a constant related to the elastic properties of both materials. While for the general interface
corners, their singular orders depend on the corner angle as well as the elastic properties of the materials. Owing to the
diﬀerence of the singular orders of homogeneous cracks, interface cracks and interface corners, their associated stress
intensity factors are usually deﬁned separately and even not compatibly. Since homogenous cracks and interface cracks
are just special cases of interface corners, in order to build a direct connection among them a uniﬁed deﬁnition for their
stress intensity factors is proposed in this paper. Based upon the analytical solutions obtained previously for the multib-
onded anisotropic wedges, the near tip solutions for the general interface corners have been divided into ﬁve diﬀerent cat-
egories depending on whether the singular order is distinct or repeated, real or complex. To provide a stable and eﬃcient
computing approach for the general mixed-mode stress intensity factors, the path-independent H-integral based on reci-
procal theorem of Betti and Rayleigh is established in this paper. The complementary solutions needed for calculation
of H-integral are also provided in this paper. To illustrate our results, several diﬀerent kinds of examples are shown such
as cracks in homogenous isotropic or anisotropic materials, central or edge notches in isotropic materials, interface cracks
and interface corners between two dissimilar materials.

Electric devices are composed of many diﬀerent parts. Because each part may be made from diﬀerent mate-
rials and may have diﬀerent shapes, it is very possible that many interface corners exist in several local ﬁelds of

From (2.8a)2 and the deﬁnitions given in (2.2) and (2.5)–(2.7), we see that the singular orders are totally deter-
mined through the material properties and conﬁgurations of all wedges. Since we consider the singular ﬁelds
and the strain energy cannot be unbounded, only the values located in the range of 0 < Re(k) < 1 are consid-
ered in this paper. If more than one k locate in this range, we select the one whose real part is minimum as kc,
i.e., the one with the most critical singular order kc  1. If kc is a complex number, it has been proved that its
conjugate kc is also a root of kK(3)k = 0 (Hwu et al., 2003).
When r! 0, i.e., the near tip ﬁeld, the terms associated with kc will dominate the stress behavior. Neglect-
ing all the other singular and nonsingular terms, and expanding the near tip solution (2.1) for the terms asso-
ciated with kc, we may express the displacement and stress function vectors in terms of the eigenvector u0
obtained from (2.8a)2. However, an eigenvalue kc may correspond several linearly independent eigenvectors
u0. If kc is a nonrepeated root, only one arbitrary scalar is needed to describe u0. When kc is a double root,
two arbitrary scalars are needed. While for a triple root kc, three arbitrary scalars are needed. If kc is complex,
the arbitrary scalar associated with u0 is also complex which contains two real scalars. With the above under-
standing, the near tip solutions (2.9a) may now be rewritten as
Case 1: kc is distinct and real, kc = kR,
uðr; hÞ ¼ crkRpðhÞ;
/ðr; hÞ ¼ crkRqðhÞ: ð2:10aÞ
Case 2: kc is double and real, kc = kR,

the number of arbitrary scalars is dependent on the multiplicity of kc. Note that the solutions shown in (2.10a–
e) are valid for any wedge of the multibonded wedges, and hence from now on unless special notiﬁcation is
needed the subscript k denoting the wedge has been neglected for simplicity.

Diﬀerentiating the stress function vector /(r, 0) with respect to r for each case shown in (2.10a–e), and
substituting the results into (3.4b), we can get the relations between the coeﬃcients ci (or simply c) and the
stress intensity factors k as follows.

Note that in case 2 K* is a 3 · 2 matrix, while in case 3 K* is a 3 · 3 matrix. In case 4 k* is a 2 · 1 vector that
could be (KII,KI)
T or (KI,KIII)
T depending on the contents of the 2 · 1 vector q*(0) which may contain the ﬁrst
two components or the last two components of the 3 · 1 vector q(0). The associated diagonal matrix denoted
by hi shown in (3.5d) is a 2 · 2 matrix in which each component is varied according to the subscript * = 1, 2,
and e1 = e, e2 = e. While in case 5, the associated diagonal matrix is a 3 · 3 matrix in which each component
is varied according to the subscript * = 1, 2, 3 and e1 = e, e2 = e, e3 = 0. Thus, K is a 2 · 2 matrix in case 4
and a 3 · 3 matrix in case 5.

k ¼

in which the contents of matrices k, K and c depend on whether the singular order is distinct or repeated, real
or complex as those described in (2.10).
From the above discussion, we see that the deﬁnition for the stress intensity factors proposed in (3.4) is
applicable not only to the interface corners but also to the cracks in homogeneous media or bimaterial inter-
faces. The conventional deﬁnition (3.1) is just a special case of (3.4) with kR = 1/2 and e = 0, while the deﬁ-
nition for the bimaterial stress intensity factor (3.2) is a special case of (3.4) with kR = 1/2. With this uniﬁed
deﬁnition, it becomes possible that the failure criteria developed for the crack problems may be useful for the
prediction of the failure of interface corners. Moreover, the fracture toughness measured from the standard
crack specimen may also have a direct connection with the toughness of interface corners.
It should be noted that the uniﬁed deﬁnition proposed in (3.4) is valid only for the most critical singular
order kc  1. For the cases that two or more but diﬀerent eigenvalues exist in the range 0 < Re(k) < 1, deﬁni-
tion (3.4) cannot provide meaningful constant factors for the lower critical singular orders. For example, if
/;r ! c1kcrkc1q1ðhÞ þ c2k2rk21q2ðhÞ when r! 0, no constant values of k2 related to k2 can be got through
the uniﬁed deﬁnition shown in (3.4). The possible way to get k2 is further modifying the deﬁnition with /,r

Case 1: Substituting the near tip solution (2.10a) into (4.4), we see that the suitable complementary solution,
which will make the H-integral be independent of r, should be the one with eigenvalue kR, i.e.,
u^ðr; hÞ ¼ c^rkR p^ðhÞ; /^ðr; hÞ ¼ c^rkR q^ðhÞ; ð4:5Þ
where p^ðhÞ and q^ðhÞ can be obtained from (2.9a) with u0 determined by (2.8a) whose eigenvalue is kR. Thus,
it is important to know whether k is also an eigenvalue of K(3)u0 = 0 when k is. Since the explicit expression
of the determinant of matrix K(3) is quite complicated, it is not easy to perform rigorous proof. Instead,
numerical check has been done in this paper, which shows that when k is a root of K(3)u0 = 0, so is k.
Substituting (2.10a) and (4.5) into (4.4) with c^ ¼ 1, we get

The prime • 0 in (4.6b) denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to h. Note that formula (4.6) is derived from the
path through the singular ﬁeld. By the path-independent property of H-integral, the value H appeared in
(4.6a) can now be evaluated using (4.3) through any convenient path C far away from the tip. In (4.3), the
displacement u and traction t of the actual state can be obtained from any other methods such as ﬁnite element
or boundary element method, while u^ and t^ of the virtual state is from the complementary solution (4.5) whose
c^ ¼ 1 and t^ ¼ o/^=os.
Case 2: Similar to the discussion of Case 1, the suitable complementary solution will be the one associated
with eigenvalue kR, i.e.,
u^ðr; hÞ ¼ rkR c^1p^1ðhÞ þ c^2p^2ðhÞf g;
/^ðr; hÞ ¼ rkR c^1q^1ðhÞ þ c^2q^2ðhÞf g:

Substituting (2.10b) and (4.7) into (4.4) with c^1 ¼ 1, c^2 ¼ 0, and c^1 ¼ 0, c^2 ¼ 1, respectively, we get

and H1 is the value calculated from (4.3) with c^1 ¼ 1, c^2 ¼ 0 for the complementary solution, while H2 is the
one associated with c^1 ¼ 0, c^2 ¼ 1. From (4.8), the coeﬃcient ci can now be evaluated by simply matrix inver-

c^2 ¼ 0, c^3 ¼ 1, respectively, and then by matrix inversion, we get

shows the variation of the stress intensity factors of the interface cracks versus the stiﬀness ratio of the two
materials. No matter what kinds of combination of the bimaterials, the singular orders of this example are
always 1/2 and 1/2 ± ie, which belong to the category of case 5 discussed in Section 2. The last example
shows a typical example of interface corners, which occurs frequently in electric devices. The singular order
of this case is generally complex.
Note that in the following calculation, the stresses and displacements of the actual system are obtained
from the commercial ﬁnite element software ANSYS. For convenience, the paths are usually selected to pass
through Gauss points or nodal points. Otherwise, interpolation technique is used to get the values of displace-
ments and stresses. In our example all the integration paths are selected to pass through nodal points. Since
the numerical output will depend on element meshes and integral paths, both studies have been done in (Kuo,
2006) before performing the following examples. Kuo’s results show that the convergent and stable values will
be obtained if the normalized element size b/a is less than 0.05 and the normalized integral paths r/a lie within
0.2 < r/a < 0.8, where b is the grid size of the meshes in the region 2a · 2a centered on the crack/notch tips, r is
the radius of circular integral path and a is the crack or notch length.
It should be noted that although the path independency of H-integral has been proved theoretically in Sec-
tion 4, numerical studies through several diﬀerent shapes and ranges of paths show that the stress intensity
factors calculated from the paths with r/a less than 0.2 become unstable and will change rapidly, which
may come from the incorrect stress information near the crack/notch tip provided by FEA. Therefore, when
using H-integral to calculate the stress intensity factors we avoid to take the values near the range of r/a < 0.2,
which is the advantage of the path-independent integrals.
Example 1. Cracks in homogeneous isotropic or anisotropic materials
Since this kind of problems has been done vastly in the literature, for the purpose of comparison we now
select two cases presented by Stern et al. (1976). One is an edge crack in a rectangular homogeneous isotropic
plate subjected to uniform tension, and the other is the same plate subjected to uniform end shear and fully
clamped at the other end, as shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The Young’s modulus E and Poisson’s ratio
m of the plate are: E = 300 GPa,m = 0.25. The uniform stress applied at the end of the plate is r = 1 MPa.
Table 1 is the comparison of our results with those presented by Stern et al. (1976), which shows that our
results well agree with those of Stern et al. (1976). Moreover, the path-independent property of H-integral
is conﬁrmed through this numerical computation in which four diﬀerent paths used in our calculation are
shown in Fig. 3. Following the requirement that the normalized element size b/a be less than 0.05, the results
shown in Table 1 are based on the FEA meshes of 8284 elements and 25,331 nodes.

center interface crack and edge interface crack are presented in Table 4. The reference values shown in
Table 4 are those calculated from the analytical solutions for the center interface cracks in inﬁnite plates
(Rice, 1988; Hwu, 1993). Since the values of a/W and a/L have been purposely selected to be small
enough to simulate the inﬁnite plates, our results are well agreed with the reference values. Note that
the selection of the reference length ‘ will not alter the magnitude of k (means

the individual values of KI and KII, and hence when comparing with other solutions one should be careful
about its selection.

The singular order of this problem is calculated to be kc = 0.467–0.037i. The stress intensity factors k versus
the near tip distance r are shown in Table 5, Figs. 8 and 9 for the values calculated from (3.4) and (4.14). Fig. 8
shows that the values of KI and KII calculated directly from the deﬁnition (3.4) become unstable when r! 0,
which causes trouble to determine the limiting values. While in Fig. 9, KI and KII calculated from H-integral
are quite independent of the paths, in which r stands for the radius of the circular path. The range of r shown
in Fig. 8 is 0.0006 < r < 0.017 while that of Fig. 9 is 0.3 < r < 0.8. The former is the near tip region, from which

It is known that the interface crack is a special case of interface corner with angle a = 0 (Fig. 7), and the
crack in homogeneous materials is a special case of interface crack between two identical materials. Therefore,
with the uniﬁed deﬁnition proposed in this paper, it is interesting to know the variation of stress intensity fac-
tors with respect to corner angles and material properties (Kuo, 2006). Followings are the results based upon
Example 4 (see Fig. 7) by varying the angle a of interface corner. All the stress intensity factors in this example
are calculated from (4.14) with circular integral path of r = 0.7875 mm.

ABSTRACT 
Usually in the study of singularity problems only the most critical singular order 
is considered. For three-dimensional interface corner problems, if only the most 
critical singular order of stresses is considered, it is possible to lose the opportunity to 
compute the full modes of stress intensity factors. To fully understand the failure 
behaviour of three-dimensional interface corners, in this paper a definition of the 
stress intensity factors for the lower singular orders is proposed based upon that for 
the most critical singular order. Moreover, to compute the proposed multi-order stress 
intensity factors accurately and efficiently, a path-independent H-integral which has 
been proved useful for the two-dimensional interface corners is now modified into a 
domain-independent H-integral for the three-dimensional interface corner problems. 
Because the stress intensity factors characterize the fracture behaviour focused on an 
arbitrary tip along the corner front, based on anisotropic elasticity the near tip 
solutions and complementary solutions of two-dimensional generalized plane strain 
problems are introduced and then utilized for computation of three-dimensional 
H-integral. For illustrating the validity of the present work, several three-dimensional 
numerical examples are analyzed and compared with the existing published solutions. 
Finally, two examples about the interface corners which occur frequently in electric 
packages are solved to show the feasibility and practicability of the proposed 
approach. 
 
Keywords: Stress intensity factors; Three-dimensional interface corner; 
Domain-independent H-integral 
 
1. Introduction 
Evaluation of the stress intensity factors for interface corners is required in many 
different engineering branches in which the most representative one is electronic 
3 
 
When employing H-integral to compute the stress intensity factors, the near tip 
solutions and their associated complementary solutions for the considered 
crack/corner problems are needed. Although no analytical near tip solutions have been 
obtained for the general three-dimensional crack/corner problems, in this paper the 
near tip solutions obtained for the generalized plane stress and generalized plane 
strain multi-wedge problems [16,17] have been proved to be useful for the present 3D 
crack/corner problems. The reasons for this successful application are: (1) along the 
3D crack/corner front each point can be treated as a tip of 2D crack/corner which can 
be considered to be in generalized plane stress condition for cracks in the outer 
portion and in generalized plane strain condition for cracks in the inner portion; (2) 
besides the typical 2D stress/strain components, the additional third directional 
stress/strain components such as 2313,σσ  and 2313,εε  are all available in the 
solutions obtained by employing Stroh formalism for two-dimensional anisotropic 
elasticity [18]. 
Several benchmark numerical examples, such as an elliptical crack, a through 
thickness edge crack, or a through thickness edge notch in a homogeneous isotropic 
material subjected to remote tension, and a penny-shaped interface crack between two 
dissimilar isotropic materials subjected to remote tension, are analyzed for the 
purpose of comparison. Finally, two examples about the interface corners which 
appear frequently in electronic packages are analyzed to show the feasibility and 
practicability of the proposed approach. 
 
2. Stress intensity factors for the most critical singular order 
If only the most critical singular order of stresses is considered and the 
possibility of logarithmic singularity is disregarded, by superimposing all the 
eigenfunctions with the same real part of singular orders, without loss of generality 
the near tip solutions of two-dimensional interface corners can be expressed as [19]

with three independent eigenfunctions, or a pair of complex conjugate roots, or the 
combination of one real simple root and a pair of complex conjugate roots, etc. [1]. In

 Same situation as Eq. (2.8) occurs for a bi-wedge composed of two 
unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites whose properties are the same but fiber 
orientations are opposite with respect to 1x -axis such as that shown in Fig. 2(b) with

corner problems. Here, we like to extend our work to derive a three-dimensional 
version of H-integral to deal with 3D interface corner problems. 
In the absence of body forces, the reciprocal theorem of Betti and Rayleigh can 
be expressed as [20]

where jn  is the surface normal, ijσ  and iu  are the stresses and displacements of 
the actual system, while ˆijσ  and ˆiu  are those of the complementary system. S is any 
closed surface contour surrounding the corner front, which is selected to be

on the plane lx =3  bounded by the contours similar to '1 2, , , and RC C C Cε  with an 
outward unit normal vector )1,0,0(=n ; 1 2'c RS = S + S + S + Sε  in which 
' 1 2, , , and RS S S Sε  are, respectively, curved boundary surfaces extended by 
' 1 2, , , and RC C C Cε  from 03 =x  to lx =3 . If we reverse the integration direction of 
RS ′  and denote it by RS  to conform with that of εS , i.e., both of these two surface 
integrals are integrated from 03 =x  to lx =3  and from the lower flank ( 0θθ = ) to 
the upper flank ( nθθ = ), the outward unit normal vectors of RS  and εS  will then 
be denoted by )0,,( 21 nn  and )0,,( 21 nn −− .  
With o c lS = S S S+ + , 21 SSSSS Rc +++= ε , the normal directions stated

versatility of the present work for 3D interface corner problems, several numerical 
examples are shown in this section such as (i) an elliptical central crack in a 
homogeneous isotropic material subjected to remote tension, (ii) a through thickness 
edge crack in a homogeneous isotropic material subjected to remote tension, (iii) a 
through thickness edge notch in a homogeneous isotropic material subjected to remote 
tension, (iv) a penny-shaped interface crack between two dissimilar isotropic 
materials subjected to remote tension, (v) a through thickness interface corner 
between two dissimilar materials subjected to remote tension, and (vi) a representative 
block of electronic package subjected to tensile loading. The singular orders and their 
associated modes of SIF are sorted in Table 1 for these crack/notch/interface 
crack/interface corner problems. Although in this Table all the examples contain full 
modes of stress intensity factors III KK ,  and IIIK  by including the lower singular 
orders 2δ  and/or 3δ , it should be noted that in our numerical experiments there are 
still some cases of notches and interface corners which have only two distinct real 
simple roots associated with only two modes of stress intensity factors. 
In the following examples to calculate k through Eq. (4.9) or Eq. (4.11), the 
stresses and displacements of the actual system needed in calculating iH  of h from 
Eq. (4.5) are obtained from the commercial finite element software ANSYS. For 
convenience, the integral domain is chosen to be a surface bounded by a circular path 
emanating from the lower crack/corner surface and terminating on the upper 
crack/corner surface, and the normal of this integral surface domain is tangent to the 
crack front. Moreover, the surface integral is performed through a two-stage 
numerical line integral (e.g. trapezoidal method or Simpson's method) with respect to 
θ  and r  one by one, i.e., d d dS r rθ= . The two-stage line integral means that we 
perform the integral firstly with respect to θ  and we can get several results which 
are scalar functions of r , and then we proceed to integrate with respect to r , and 
consequently the surface integral is complete. Because the circular domain is 
employed, the integration paths with respect to θ  are also selected to be circular and 
pass through nodal points in our examples. Since the numerical output will depend on 
element meshes and integration paths, the convergent test and domain-independent 
study were done numerically before performing all the following examples. It should 
be mentioned that although the domain-independent property of H-integral has been 
proved theoretically in Section 4, when using H-integral to calculate the stress 
15 
 
 
Example 2. A through thickness edge crack in a homogeneous isotropic material 
subjected to remote tension. 
Consider an isotropic rectangular parallelepiped with a through-thickness 
edge-crack under remote tension. Since the local environments of the edge crack and 
center crack are the same, the relation for the previous example, Eq. (5.1), is still valid 
for the present example. The difference of these two examples comes from the 
external environments which will be reflected through the vector h containing the 
values of H-integral, 321 ,, HHH . With this understanding, a numerical example 
presented by Li, et al. [22], Sukumar, et al. [23], Raju and Newmann [24] for edge 
crack has been done for the purpose of comparison and our results agree with them 
with difference below 4.03%.  
 
Example 3. A through thickness edge notch in a homogeneous isotropic material 
subjected to remote tension. 
In order to accentuate that the proposed approach is not only applied to the 
cracked problems but also suitable for the general corner problems, a through 
thickness edge notch in an isotropic specimen under remote tension is considered in 
this example (Fig. 5). The dimensions of the specimen used in this example are: w = 
1mm, h = 2w, t = 0.7w, and o90=β  which are the half width, half height, half 
thickness, and notch angle of this specimen. The surfaces at 3x t= ±  are traction-free. 
The remote tension oσ  is specified as 10MPa  with 0oϑ =  or 45oϑ = . The 
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of this specimen are 210GPa  and 0.3, 
respectively. For the purpose of comparison, the boundary conditions set in the 
analysis are: 3 0u =  on the surface 3 0x = , and 1 2 0u u= =  on the line 1x w=  & 
2 0x =  to simulate the situation presented by Ortiz, et al. [15]. Note that to prevent 
the rotation of the body induced by the inclined tension oσ  with 45oϑ = , the 
boundary condition 1 0u =  is set on two lines, ( 1x w=  & wx 0875.02 = ) and 
( 1x w=  & wx 0875.02 −= ). 
When using the key matrix provided in [1,16,17] to solve the singular orders for 
the present example, we obtain three distinct real simple roots, i.e., 4555.0=δ ,

where Γ  is the Gamma function, ε  is the oscillation index, i.e., the imaginary part 
of the most critical singular order, oσ  is the applied tension on the remote ends or 
the crack surfaces, and a is the radius of the penny-shaped crack.  
Figure 6 is a quarter plot of the cylinder composed of two different materials in 
which a penny-shaped crack is embedded on the interface between material 1 and 
material 2. The two materials are both isotropic, whose elastic properties are: 
3.0 GPa,150 == νE  for material 1 and 25.0 GPa,20 == νE  for material 2. The 
radius of the penny-shaped crack, radius of the cylinder cross-section, and half height 
of the cylinder used in this example are: a = 0.005mm, b = 10a and h = 10a. The 
applied remote tension oσ  is 10MPa . The boundary conditions used in finite 
element analysis are: 1 0u =  on the surface 1 0x = , 3 0u =  on the surface 3 0x = , 
and 2 0u =  on the line bρ =  & 2 0x = . The singular orders of this example are 
calculated as i0855.05.0 ±  and 0.5 accompanied with one pair of complex conjugate 
eigenfunctions and one real eigenfunction. Because these three singular orders have 
the same real part, they are all parts of the most critical singular order, and hence Eq. 
(4.9) can be written as

in which the reference length l  is selected to be 0.01mm. From Eq. (5.4), we see 
that no mode will be lost if we merely consider the most critical singular order in this 
example. For the present pure tension case, 01 ≠H  and 03 =H .  
 In addition to the domain-independence proved theoretically in Eq. (4.4), to get 
further evidence for the domain-independence of H-integral, in this example we 
choose three different rectangular paths with wide range as shown in Figure 7. Table 3 
19 
 
From Eq. (5.5), we see that if only the most critical singular order is considered 
mode-III stress intensity factor will be lost no matter which kind of loading is applied, 
which will then be picked up by considering the next higher singular order. Figure 9 
shows the results of IK , IIK  and IIIK  versus tx /3  for the present example. From 
this result we see that the stress intensity factors in the inner part of the interface 
corner will approach to certain constant values not far away from those of the 
corresponding plane strain problems discussed in [1], which is acceptable from the 
engineering viewpoint.  
While the advantage of path-independent integrals for crack problems has been 
shown in the literature for a long time, relatively few examples have been presented 
for three-dimensional interface corners. Since the domain-independent characteristics 
of H-integral has been proved theoretically in Section 4 and numerically in Example 4, 
all the numerical solutions given in this paper are presented without any convergent 
difficulties. To show the advantage of the present H-integral, followings are the results 
obtained through the conventional approach, i.e., calculated via the definition (2.3) or 
(3.3), which will then encounter the convergent difficulty. Figures 10(a),(b),(c) are 
plots of stress intensity factors IK , IIK  and IIIK  versus the distance to the corner 
tip r/h. From these figures, we see that the values of stress intensity factors become 
unstable and cannot be convergent to a definite value, and hence it is really difficult to 
terminate the approaching of r to zero. This problem is due to the complexity and 
infinity of stresses near the interface corners, which can be avoided in the calculation 
through H-integral by using the path away from the corner tip. 
 
Example 6: A representative block of electronic package subjected to tensile loading 
For the purpose of giving a good connection between the present method and the 
real engineering problem, a representative block of electronic package is discussed in 
this example. Figure 11 is a quarter plot of the representative block in which the 
interface corner between the solder ball and BT substrate is analyzed to discuss the 
effect of the radius of solder ball (B1) on the stress intensity factors. The dimensions 
of each portion are also shown in Figure 11 in which B2=0.8*B1 and B3=0.6*B1. 
This discussion is helpful to realize the relevancy between the radius of solder ball 
and the reliability of electronic package. The boundary and loading conditions are: the 
entire bottom of the block is clamped and the entire top is subjected to 10MPaoσ = . 
21 
 
through the near tip solution and its associated complementary solution, and hence 
will reflect the local behaviour of the interface corners; whereas h containing the 
values of 3D H-integral will then reflect the effects of external loading and structural 
geometry. Therefore, through the contents of these matrices it is helpful for us to 
understand the details of multi-order stress intensity factors for the general three 
dimensional interface corners. Detailed discussions for several different kinds of 
problems have been presented in our numerical examples, which show that our 
proposed approach is not only versatile but also efficient and accurate.

These global influential factors are reflected through another important parameter – stress 
intensity factor. Therefore, for interface problems it is important to know the singular 
orders as well as their associated stress intensity factors. However, due to the complexity 
of stresses near the tip of interface corners/cracks, most of the existing calculation 
methods will encounter the problem of accuracy and convergency. To solve this problem, 
two approaches introduced recently will be discussed in this paper. One is the 
improvement of the computational method for stress intensity factors by establishing a 
path independent H-integral for general interface problems (Hwu and Kuo, 2007), and the 
other is the improvement of boundary element method by including the fundamental 
solution of bimaterials. 
In addition to the improvement of computational method for interface problems, in 
this paper we like to emphasize the unified characteristics of the method introduced here 
for the interface corners/cracks. In other words, the formulae and solution techniques 
introduced in this paper are applicable for any kinds of anisotropic materials and 
piezoelectric materials, as well as any kinds of corners including cracks, interface cracks, 
corners and interface corners. Moreover, through the modification of H-integral, they are 
valid not only for two dimensional problems but also for three dimensional problems 
( Kuo and Hwu, 2009). 
 
2. Near tip solutions for interface cracks and corners 
By employing Stroh formalism for anisotropic elasticity, the near tip solution for 
interface cracks and corners can be written in terms of the stress intensity factors as (Hwu, 
et al., 2003; Hwu and Kuo, 2007; Hwu and Ikeda, 2008)

repeated or distinct. If the stress singularity is concerned and the strain energy should be 
bounded, only the region 1)Re(0 << δ  is considered. Note that the generalized 
fundamental elasticity matrix )(αN  is a 6×6 matrix for anisotropic materials and is a 
8×8 matrix for piezoelectric materials. 
 
4. Stress intensity factors 
A unified definition of stress intensity factors which correspond to the most critical 
singular order cδ  and are valid for cracks, interface cracks, corners and interface corners, 
and anisotropic and piezoelectric materials was proposed as (Hwu and Kuo, 2007; Hwu 
and Ikeda, 2008)

To provide a stable and efficient computing approach for the general mixed-mode stress 
intensity factors, the path-independent H-integral based on reciprocal theorem of Betti 
and Rayleigh was established in (Hwu and Kuo, 2007) for 2D problems and in (Kuo and 
Hwu, 2009) for 3D problems, i.e.,

Figure 1. From this Figure, we see that when 0β =  the corner problems will be reduced 
to crack problems, and when material 1 and material 2 are chosen to be the same material 
the interface corners/cracks will be reduced to the corners/cracks in homogeneous 
materials.  Without loss of generality, in all examples the calculation of singular orders 
and stress intensity factors is focused on the right tip of crack/corner.  
 
Example 1: a center crack in a homogeneous anisotropic material 
A center crack with size 2a in an infinite anisotropic plate subjected to remote 
tension σ  is a classical problem in fracture mechanics, which is usually used as the first 
check for the advanced studies. It is well known that both of the singular order and stress 
intensity factor of this problem are independent of the material properties, and are 
obtained analytically as 0.5δ = , =IK aσ π  and = 0II IIIK K = . To check our results 
by this classical problem, in Figure 1 the crack is simulated by letting 00β = , the infinite 
plate is approximated by setting 30h a=  and 31w a= , the homogeneous material is 
made by selecting two identical materials, and the anisotropic material is made by 
rotating the principal direction of an orthotropic material γ  degree. The numerical data 
used for our testing is then given by 0.01m, a = 0 1MPaσ = , 30γ = D  and

E E = E =
G = G = G =
ν = ν = ν =
   
   
   
                   
With the above numerical data, the singular order calculated from (4) is obtained as 
0.5δ =  which is a triple root, and the stress intensity factors calculated from H-integral, 
i.e., from (8)1 and (9), are obtained as 
= 0.178 MPa m,    = 0.000107 MPa m,    0.I II IIIK K K =            
It can easily be seen that all these values agree very well with the analytical solutions 
provided in the literature. 
 
Example 2: a center corner in a homogeneous anisotropic material  
In this example, the center corner is represented by letting 030β =  in Figure 1 and 
all the other geometrical and material properties are the same as Example 1. By using the 
same formulae and solution techniques as center cracks stated in Example 1, the singular 
orders and stress intensity factors of this problem are calculated as 
 8
6. Material types – anisotropic or piezoelectric 
To show that the formulae and solution techniques presented in this paper can also 
be extended to the piezoelectric materials, the interface crack/corner between two 
dissimilar piezoelectric materials will be discussed in this section through example 5. To 
see the piezo effects, examples 3 and 4 will be reconsidered by letting the anisotropic 
material be the one of piezoelectric materials excluding the piezoelectric constants. 
 
Example 5: an interface crack/corner between two dissimilar piezoelectric materials  
Examples 3 and 4 are reconsidered here by replacing the anisotropic materials with 
the piezoelectric materials PZT-7A and PZT-5H whose material properties are listed in 
Table 1. For both cases, PZT-7A and PZT-5H with 0γ = D  are employed to constitute 
material 1 and material 2 (see Figure 1), respectively. All the other geometrical 
dimensions are the same as examples 3 and 4. A uniform remote tension 0 1MPaσ =  is 
applied on the two horizontal edges, while a uniform electric flux density 
2
0 0.001C / mD = −  and an electric constraint 4 0u =  are, respectively, specified on the 
bottom edge and top edge. The singular orders calculated from (4) and the stress/electric 
intensity factors calculated from H-integral, i.e., from (8)1 and (9), are obtained as 
follows.

Example 6: an interface crack/corner between two dissimilar anisotropic materials  
To see the piezo effects, two similar cases as example 5 will be reconsidered by 
letting the anisotropic materials be the ones of PZT-7A and PZT-5H excluding their 
piezoelectric constants. By using the same formulae and solution techniques as example 1, 
 10
 
Example 7: an edge crack in a homogeneous isotropic material (2D)  
An edge crack embedded in an isotropic plate under plane strain assumption is 
discussed in this example. The geometry of this plate is plotted in Figure 2(a) in which 
1mm, / 1a a w= =  and / 1.75h w = . The uniform tension applied at the ends of the plate 
is 0 1MPaσ = . The Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of this isotropic plate are 
210GPa and 1/3. It is worthy to note that the local environments of the edge crack and 
center crack are the same and the difference of these two geometries comes from the 
external environments which will be reflected through the vector h containing the values 
of H-integral. As the statement in example 1, the most critical singular order of stress 
generated in this example is a triple root 0.5 because the crack is within a homogeneous 
elastic material. Similarly, using eq. (8)1 and eq. (9) the stress intensity factors can be 
calculated as 
5= 0.158 MPa m,    = 0.169 10  MPa m.I IIK K

Normalization of IK  leads to 0/ 2.817IK aσ π =  which is close to the stress intensity 
factors of the inner part of the through thickness edge crack for the three dimensional 
case discussed in the next example (see Figure 2(b)).  
 
Example 8: a through thickness edge crack in a homogeneous isotropic material (3D)  
Consider a rectangular parallelepiped with a through thickness edge crack under 
remote tension as shown in Figure 2(b) where the parameters a, t, h, and w are the crack 
length, thickness, half height, and half width of this rectangular solid. The remote tension 
oσ  is specified as 1MPa , while a is equal to 1mm . The other dimensions of the 
specimen are a/w = 1, h/w = 1.75, and t/w = 3, where 3 / 2x t= ±  are the free surfaces. 
This rectangular specimen is composed of an isotropic material with Young’s modulus 
210GPaE =  and Poisson’s ratio 1/ 3ν = . To have the same situation as the comparing 
published results presented by (Raju and Newmann, 1977; Li, et al., 1998; Sukumar, et al., 
2000), when performing the finite element analysis, the boundary conditions are set to be 
3 0u =  on the surface 3 0x =  due to symmetry, while 1 2 0u u= =  on the line 1x w=  & 
2 0x = . Figure 3 is a plot of the normalized stress intensity factor aKI πσ 0/  versus the 
position of crack front 3 /x t . From this plot we see that the present results well agree

element formulation (Brebbia, et al., 1984). To show the improvement of this special 
boundary element, one typical example about the interface corners is presented in this 
section.   
 
Example 9: an edge interface corner between two dissimilar materials 
Since the development of this special boundary element is for the improvement of 
the computational accuracy and efficiency of interface problems, the example considered 
here is an interface edge corner (Figure 5) treated in our previous study (Hwu and Kuo, 
2007). The material above the interface is isotropic whose properties are: GPa10=E and 
2.0=v , and the material below the interface is orthotropic whose properties are the same 
as those given in Example 1. The reference length used in the definition (7) is selected to 
be 5mmb = . 
The difference between the present example and our previous study comes from the 
source of the displacement and traction vectors u and t of the actual system needed in the 
calculation of H-integral (8). In our previous study u and t are calculated by the 
commercial finite element code ANSYS, while in the present example they are calculated 
by the special boundary element introduced in this paper. In ANSYS, PLANE42 element 
is selected for the present problem. Table 2 shows the stresses at the interfacial point (2,0) 
versus the element number, from which we see that the stresses above and below the 
interface calculated from ANSYS are discontinuous, which is incorrect and will approach 
to the same values only when very fine meshes are used near the interfaces. On the other 
hand, the solutions obtained from the special boundary element will always provide 
continuous stresses across the interface. Figure 6 shows the variation of the stresses along 
the interface 1 2(0 5, 0)x x≤ ≤ =  by using 22614 elements for ANSYS and 279 elements 
(no element meshes are needed along the interface) for present BEM, from which we see 
that the stresses have the tendency to approach infinity near the corner tip and the stress 
discontinuity through ANSYS modeling becomes much more inevitable. Due to this 
difference we believe the present results shown in Table 3 is more accurate than the one 
shown in (Hwu and Kuo, 2007). Note that in Table 3, r stands for the radius of the 
circular path originated at the corner tip for the H-integral. In addition to the theoretical 
proof provided in (Hwu and Kuo, 2007), the path independent property of H-integral can 
also be confirmed through this numerical computation in which several different paths 
are used.

授及德國 Aachen University 之 Prof. M. Itskov 等等。 以一會議而言姑
且不論聽到多少新的研究或傳遞出多少自己的研究成果，單是與許多
國內外友人相會討論近期之研究與生活點滴就已足夠，更遑論又結交
了許多新的朋友，也吸收了許多新的想法。 
 
與會心得： 
這是一個小型的亞太國際專題會議，會中包含了 15 個不同主題、
1 場開幕演講、1 場特別演講、3 場大會演講、76 場一般演講及 23 件
張貼論文。  研討範圍包含 : Wave, Contact Mechanics, Crack, 
Piezocomposites, Thermal Stress, Material Modeling, Stress Analysis, 
Micro/Nano Mechanics, Viscoelasticity, Functional Materials and 
Structures, Vibration, Fatigue, Experimental Mechanics, Functional 
Graded Materials, Stress Analysis & Design 等等。 由這些主題可知本
次會議涵蓋的範圍包含許多與功能性材料與結構相關之研究，大會將
投稿之論文全文依主題分列於論文集。 我個人的論文被安排於第一
天(11/1)下午之 Crack 2 場次，我講的題目是”Interface Corners in 
Piezoelectric Materials”。 我講這個題目是因為近兩年我做了許多與界
面角相關之研究，也曾於幾個國際會議的場合發表過相關之成果，一
般聽眾的反應相當好，也因此我們最近將這一系列成果繼續擴展至壓
電材料於此次會議報告，也希望藉此機會廣為擴散自己近期的研究成
果。 除此之外，當天上午我亦主持 Crack 1 之場次，參與報告之學者
分別來自 Osaka Institute of Technology, Inha University (Korea), 
University of Hyogo (Japan), Kyushu Institute of Technology 等韓日大
學，雖無特別突出之論文於此一場次報告，整體而言，論文都屬中上
水準，依大會之要求，我必須根據論文發表人各別之表現給予不同之
評分，最後也都將這些論文推薦給相關期刊如 Acta Mechanica。
