and fine dexterity were designed, namely nut-loosening and pin-insertion, respectively. The 
nested-factorial design includes factors of gender, subject (nested within gender), 
immersion-duration, muscle-type (for EMG), and location (for skin temperature). The responses are 
dexterity, skin temperature, normalized amplitude of EMG (nRMS, in %MVC), and grip strength. 
Finally, factor analysis and stepwise regression are used to explore factors affecting the hand/finger 
dexterity. Dexterity, EMG, and skin temperature fell with prolonged cooling, but the EMG of the 
flexor digitorum superficialis remained almost unchanged during the nut-loosening task. All 
responses but the forearm skin temperature recovered to the baseline level at the end of rewarming. 
The three factors extracted by factor analysis are termed skin temperature, ambient condition, and 
EMG. They explain about two-thirds of the variation of the linear models for both dexterities, and the 
factor of skin temperature is the most influential. Sustained cooling/warming significantly 
decreases/increases finger/hand/forearm skin temperature. Dexterity, strength, and EMG are 
positively correlated to skin temperature. Therefore, keeping the finger/hand/forearm warm is 
important to maintaining hand performance. The findings could be helpful to building safety 
guidelines for working in cold environments.

Experiment 3: 
Present study investigated the discriminability of weight difference (measured by difference 
threshold) between hand skin temperatures at 34 and 12℃ by the method of constant stimuli. Ten 
male and 10 female volunteers took part in this study. The standard weight was 250g, and the result 
indicated that the difference threshold for hand skin temperature at 34oC was 3.60%, which was 
significantly less than that at 12 oC, namely 6.96%.

Experiment 4: 
The hands are probably the most used parts of the human body and offer the most effective means of 
accomplishing complex work, given their ability to perform specialized tasks that require dexterity, 
manipulability, and tactile sensitivity. As a result, they are prone to exposure in harsh conditions, 
such as cold conditions. However, the cold effect on the exertion control of hand to lift a given weight 
is still less well-documented. Therefore, present study focused on the hand force applied on the lifted 
object associated with different duration to cool hand/forearm. Ten right-handed subjects included 5 
male and 5 female volunteers took part in this study. They were asked to immerse the right hand into 
a 35°C-water bath until finger skin temperature reached 35°C. Next, they withdrew the hand, grasped 
a cylinder bottle (0.3 kg, 5cm in diameter, 16.7 cm in height), and pulled down the bottle to lift up the 
object weighted 1.3kg through the bottle away from the floor for few centimeters. They should hold 
the bottle steady for 5-10 sec as light as possible but not drop the bottle. The maximal and the steady 
force applied on the bottle were measured in terms of pressure (kpa, 1000N/m2). After that, they

INTRODUCTION 
There are occupations needing manual work in cold environments, such as fishing men, power-line 
workers that must work outside in winter, and frozen-food processing industry workers. In addition 
to heavy physical work, awkward and static postures, repetition of movements and vibration, several 
epidemiologic studies have shown that cold may be a risk factor for occurrence or aggravation of 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), such as in fish-processing industry (Chiang et al., 1993; 
Nordander et al., 1999) and meat-processing factory (Kurppa et al., 1991; Piedrahíta et al., 2004). A 
report of European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2010) also identified that the risk of 
MSDs increase with working in cold environments. 
Hands exposed to cold environments and/or contact with cold materials have been reported to cause 
impairment in muscle power and muscle endurance (Barnes & Larson, 1985), tactile sensitivity 
(Enander, 1984), hand dexterity (Schiefer et al., 1984; Riley & Cochran, 1984; Enander & Hygge, 
1990; Heus et al., 1995), and tracking performance (Goonetilleke & Hoffmann, 2009). Manual 
dexterity is frequently used to evaluate hand function and is important during hand manipulation. 
Hand/finger skin temperature has been considered the vital factor in dexterity (Schiefer et al., 1984; 
Enander, 1984; Enander & Hygge, 1990; Brajkovic & Ducharme, 2003, Chen et al., 2010) and hand 
performance (Riley & Cochran, 1984; Havenith et al., 1995, Chen et al., 2010). More importantly is 
that this impairment may lead to an increased number of accidents (Müller, 1982; cited by Havenith 
et al., 1995). 
Manual dexterity is frequently used to evaluate hand function, and it is important during hand 
manipulation. Understanding manual dexterity is seen as a key element in the design of products and 
processes for automated, flexible assembly systems. Generally, dexterity can be briefly classified 
into two types: gross and fine. The former is the gross movement of hands, fingers, and arms, and the 
latter is defined as the ability to coordinate finger movements in performing fine manipulations 
(Tiffin, 1948; Fleischman and Hempel, 1954; Berger et al., 2009).  
Even though a critical influence of hand/finger skin temperature on fine manipulation has been 
reported, to our knowledge, the degree to which skin temperature as well as electromyograph (EMG) 
contribute to hand/ finger dexterity seem not to be well-documented. Furthermore, it would be 
interesting to know whether the influences of skin temperature as well as EMG on fine dexterity are 
as great as those on gross dexterity. Therefore, the present study has two objectives: first, to 
investigate the trends of skin temperature, dexterity, grip strength, and associated EMG relative to 
conducting manual manipulation (fine or gross dexterity, and grip strength) during a prolonged cold 
immersion followed by warm immersion; and second, to construct a linear relationship between 
dexterity and skin temperature and EMG. In addition to dexterity measurement, grip strength is 
essential for manual operations. As a result, maximal grip strength will be monitored for comparison 
during immersion. (See Experiment 1)

temperature on the weight discriminability of hand. (See Experiment 3) 
Hand performance will gradually be impaired as the hands start to cool, and the level of decrease in 
performance depends on the types of tasks. In general, a greater decrement in performance has been 
found as more finger dexterity is needed (Havenith et al., 1995). Additionally, Petrofsky and Lind 
(1980) indicated that cooling the forearm could cause reductions in muscular co-ordination, nerve 
conduction speed, and strength. Changes in muscle performance can affect manual manipulation 
through changes in power, contraction speed, or muscle endurance. Therefore, to examine if the hand 
force modulation is affected by cold effect was one of this project objectives. (See Experiment 4) 
Many repetitive manual operations are in cold environments, such as fishing men, power-line 
workers that must work outside in winter, and frozen-food processing industry workers. Heavy 
physical work, awkward and static postures, and repetition of movements and vibration are the main 
risk factors causing the MSDs. Additionally, several epidemiologic studies have shown that cold may 
be a risk factor for occurrence or aggravation of MSDs, such as in fish-processing industry (Chiang et 
al., 1993; Nordander et al., 1999) and meat-processing factory (Kurppa et al., 1991; Piedrahíta et al., 
2004). A report of European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2010) also identified that the risk 
of MSDs increase with working in cold environments. As a result, to realize the cold impact on hand 
repetitive operation is necessary. (See Experiment 5) 
By experiments executed, we know that most studies on hand cooling have been carried out with 
immersion into cold water (cold pressor test) (Petrofsky & Lind, 1980; Suizu & Harada, 2005; Geurts 
et al., 2006; Coulange et al., 2006), contact with cold materials (Havenith et al., 1992; Chen et al., 
1994), or exposure in cold air (Candas & Dufour, 2007). The cold pressor test, a procedure in which 
subjects are instructed to immerse a limb into a cold-water bath, has been considered one of the most 
valid methods for inducing pain to meet the criteria of controllability, reliability, discriminability, 
convenience, and validity (Hirsch & Liebert, 1998). Thus, the cold pressor test was employed in all 
experiments of present project to cool and control skin temperatures.

1.  METHODS 
1.1 Participants 
Twenty-four volunteer participants, 12 male (mean age = 25.3 yr, mean weight = 69.1 kg) and 12 
female (mean age = 24.1 yr, mean weight = 53.6 kg), were paid for taking part in this experiment. All 
participants were right-handed, free from musculoskeletal disorders, and from National Defense 
University of Taiwan. They were informed of the nature and purpose of the experiment, and the right 
to withdraw at any time by signing an informed consent form before the experiment. The 
experimental procedure was approved by the human subjects review committee headed by the 
director of Health service division of the National Defense University. Table 1-1 shows the 
anthropometric data of all participants. 
1.2 Apparatus and Materials 
The apparatus used in this study were two water tanks mounted to a controller unit, and a throw-in 
cooler with a cooling efficiency of 750 Kcal/hr. The temperature of the first water tank (normal tank) 
was maintained at 34°C in order to control the forearm skin temperature at its baseline. The other 
tank (cold tank) was continuously maintained at 11°C to cool the forearm. 
A load cell (SENSOTEC, Model: 81) was mounted on a grip gauge to measure force output with a 
computer program sampling at 1000 Hz. The load cell was connected to a 12-bit A/D converter card, 
and linearity was calibrated using several known weights. The EMG was measured using 
Biofeedback 2000 (Physio Recorder Model: A-2340) with a default maximal sampling rate of 40 Hz.  
Participants wore latex gloves available in 3 different sizes (7, 7½ , and 8 inches) according to their 
hand width. Their hand skin temperature was measured from the dorsal side of middle phalanx and 
the forearm skin above the extensor muscle of each dominant hand. A digital 4-channel thermometer 
(TECPEL Co., Model: DTM319) sampling at 1 Hz was connected to a personal computer with 
RS-232 to record their hand skin temperature. To ensure that hand skin temperature instead of water 
temperature was measured, one thermo-sensor was fixed on the index finger using surgical tape 
while another thermo-sensor was fixed on the forearm skin using waterproof bandage. The 
dominant hand was fully protected by a latex glove sealed with adhesive tape.  
1.3 Experimental design  
This study consisted of two stages, a 40-min of cold immersion stage followed by a 15-min of warm 
immersion stage. A nested-factorial design was employed including gender, participant (nested 
within gender), and immersion time as the factors. Dependent variables included the grip MVC, the 
EMG, hand skin temperature, and four types of discomfort ratings (cold, tingling, numbness, and 
pain) rated on a verbal scale of (1) none, (2) just noticeable, (3) weak, (4) strong, (5) very strong, 
and (6) extremely strong.  
Two types of analyses were conducted in this study. The MVC, EMG and four types of discomfort 
 7 
skin temperature were collected at 4, 8, and 12 minutes of immersion. The mean value of the MVC 
and EMG would be used as the baseline.  
The first stage was the cold immersion stage (11°C). After the participants completed the baseline 
trial, all participants were asked to immerse their dominant hand into a cold tank up to the elbow joint 
and only removed their hand from the tank for the measurements of the MVC and the EMG. In order 
to standardize the limb submersion time, participants were informed by a computer signal when to 
submerge their dominant hand and when to remove it. In this stage, subjective discomfort ratings 
were collected at the beginning of the immersion, and at 4, 12, 20, 28, and 36 minutes while the MVC 
and the EMG were measured at 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 minutes of cold immersion. The MVC and the 
subjective discomfort rating were collected at different time points because high external pressure on 
the hand (e.g. pain) during the MVC exertion could have an impact on the discomfort rating 
(Fransson-Hall & Kilbom, 1993).  
The second stage was the warm immersion stage (34°C). Immediately after the cold-water 
immersion stage, all participants were asked to remove their dominant hands from the cold tank and 
put into the warm tank. Subjective discomfort ratings were collected at the beginning, and at 4, 9, and 
14 minutes while the MVC and the EMG were measured at 5, 10, and 15 minutes during this 15-min 
warm-water immersion.  
All participants went through this experimental protocol once. For the MVC exertion, the 
participants sat comfortably with their right arm hang in a neutral position. With their forearm and 
wrist supported by the armrest, the participants maintain their elbow at a 90° angle and the wrists in a 
straight position and squeeze the hand Dynamometer with maximum strength for 4 seconds (Chang 
& Shih, 2007). The MVC was defined as the first maximal strength measurement during the exertion 
process. The amplitude of the EMG signals was recorded from extensor digitorums (ED) and flexor 
digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. During this MVC exertion, the RMS EMG was measured 
with 2-cm-diameter surface EMG electrodes placed on extensor and flexor muscles. The root mean 
square (RMS) of EMG data was normalized using the formula suggested by Lavender & Marras 
(1990): Value) Resting Value MVC/(Value) RestingValue(Task NRMS  .  
2. RESULTS 
A series of t-tests were conducted to compare gender difference in anthropometric data (Table 1-1). 
These tests indicated that male had greater dimensions in all anthropometric data of upper extremity 
but smaller forearm surface area-to-volume ratio (750.7/1430.8=0.52 vs. 591.4/1000.4=0.59) than 
the female. Table 1-2 and Table 1-3 summarize the mean and standard deviation of all performance 
measures. The hand skin temperatures given in Table 1-2 and Table 1-3 are different because 
discomfort ratings were measured at time points different from those of EMG and MVC.

length. 
3. DISCUSSIONS 
Gender had a significant effect on the MVC, the EMG of flexor and extensor during cold and warm 
immersion. The MVC of female participants was approximately 71% of male (28.04 kg vs. 39.40 kg) 
(Table 1-2). Male participants had significantly greater grip MVC and smaller NRMS of EMG than 
females as reported in Morse et al. (2006) and male participants experienced greater discomfort 
sensation. The SEM analysis indicated that gender had a significant effect on hand skin temperature, 
significantly greater fluctuations were found in female participants in the initial stages of cold water 
immersion and warm water immersion (see Table 1-2 and 1-3). Female had a greater decrease in 
finger skin temperature (from 33.7°C to 12.7°C) than male (from 33.9°C to 13.8) during cold 
immersion and a greater increase in finger skin temperature (from 12.0°C to 31.9°C) than male (from 
11.9°C to 31.5) during warm immersion (Table 1-2).  
The SEM was very useful in exploring the casual relationships between gender, anthropometric 
dimensions, skin temperature and MVC. It proved that gender and palm length both can predict MVC 
effectively such that male participants had greater MVC than female given the same palm length. But 
the SEM analysis in Table 1-5 indicated that the relationship between forearm surface area to the 
volume ratio and the hand skin temperature was not significance (p=0.142). This insignificant effect 
of forearm surface area to the volume ratio could have been caused by several reasons:  
Our study estimated the forearm surface area roughly by area of a Trapezium [(Hand length *Palm 
width) *2(square) + [(Wrist circum. + Forearm circum.)*Forearm length/2] without acknowledging that 
the body surface area (BSA) is very difficult to measure accurately because of the complex geometry 
of the human body (Tikuisis et al., 2001). The most cited research for the measurement of BSA (Du 
bois & Du bois, 1916) measured the BSA by mapping the body with a paper mold. The recent 
development of three dimensional laser scanning technology and sophisticated graphics editing 
software provided an alternative and potentially more accurate determination of BSA. Other than 
imprecise estimation of BSA, other gender-related factors, such as level of adiposity (Sloan & 
Keatinge, 1973), thermal gradient (Fox et al., 1969), and body heat content (Burse, 1979), all could 
have caused this insignificant of forearm surface area to the volume ratio effect on the hand skin 
temperature. 
The time of cold water immersion had a significant effect on all responses. The skin temperature 
dropped about 20°C after 40 minutes of cold immersion (Table 1-2 and 1-3). But cold adaptation 
ceased the perceived discomfort even when the hand skin temperature, the MVC, and the EMG 
declined further. Psychological adaptation of central nerve (Enander, 1984) resulted from a decrease 
in receptor sensitivity and frequency of action potential in the afferent neuron can help to explain the 
rapid increase in discomfort sensation at first and gradually diminished after the first few minutes. In 
other words, when working under extremely cold temperature, a worker must exert a greater 
 11 
temperature dropped about 20°C after 40 minutes of cold immersion, cold adaptation ceased the 
perceived discomfort even when the hand skin temperature, the MVC, and the EMG declined further. 
On the other hand, warm immersion increased the skin temperature, muscular activity (NRMS), and 
the MVC. The MVC resumed its baseline after 5 minutes while the EMG signal recovered after 15 
minutes of warm immersion to indicate a full recovery of muscle fatigue.

rate was set at 6 per minute, and it was connected to a personal computer with an RS-232. 
5. The EMG data were collected with a 12-bit Biofeedback 2000 (Physio Recorder Model: 
A-2340). There were two active and one neutral silver-chloride electrodes, and the default 
maximal sample rate and data output were 40 and 10 Hz, respectively.  
6. A grip gauge with a load cell (SENSOTEC, Model: 81, capacity: 250 lbs, tension) was 
fabricated to measure force output. The grip span, the distance between the two outside edges of 
the handles, was set at 5 cm (Chang & Shih, 2007; Shih, 2007). The load cell was connected to a 
12-bit A/D converter card, and its linearity was calibrated with several known weights. The 
sampling rate was 1k Hz. 
1.3 Experimental Procedures and Data Acquisition 
A pilot run was first conducted to eliminate the learning effect. Five subjects different from the 24 
participants in the formal measurement were recruited to perform a ten-trial experiment related to the 
nut-loosening and pin-insertion tasks. The one-way ANOVA result indicated that performance on 
both tasks increased significantly and that it was undifferentiated after the 7
th
 practice. Therefore, at 
least seven practices were given prior to formal measurement.  
All participants were well informed of the goals and procedures prior to the formal measurement, and 
anthropometrics related to the forearm/hand were measured. Next, the surface EMG was recorded 
through two bipolar Ag-AgCl disposable disc electrodes with an active surface area of 2 cm
2
. The 
electrodes were placed about 4 cm apart over the muscles of extensor digitorums (ED) and flexor 
digitorum superficialis (FDS). Finally, the probes of the thermometer were attached by sponge tape 
on the dorsal side of the middle phalanx of the ring finger (named FST), on the middle of the third 
metacarpal of the dorsal side of the hand (named HST), and on the ED of the forearm (named FAST). 
The FAST site measured was near the site where EMG of the ED was recorded. When probes of the 
thermometer were attached, participants selected a fitting size of latex glove (six sizes available) and 
donned it, and the glove was sealed with adhesive tape. Gloves were worn not only to slow the heat 
exchange rate on FST and HST in a 40-min cold immersion but also to motivate the participants. 
When all preparations were already, the EMG amplitudes (in terms of root mean square, RMS) at rest 
and at maximal volitional contraction (MVC) associated with ED and FDS were measured, and these 
measurements were used to normalize the RMS (denoted by nRMS, in %MVC). Then at least seven 
trials were given to familiarize subjects with the formal procedures and to minimize the learning 
effect based on the result from the pilot run.  
Three successive stages were included in the formal experimental protocol, namely 
skin-temperature-controlling, cooling, and rewarming. The first stage started as soon as all 
preparation was ready. In this stage, the mean ambient temperature (standard deviation, SD) was 
23.4°C (2.6°C); the mean relative humidity (SD) was 58% (2.3%) for the nut-loosening task; and 
 23 
the following, measured at different immersion durations.  
1. The dexterity, defined as the number of loosened nuts or inserted pins in a 30-sec period. 
2. Three skin temperatures, measured on the finger (FST), hand (HST), and forearm (FAST). 
An average value from a 1-min period was taken and associated with dexterity or grip 
MVC. 
3. The normalized root mean square (RMS) of EMG amplitude (nRMS, in %MVC). The 
RMS associated with dexterity was averaged over a 30-sec period, and 5 sec for MVC. 
Next, they were normalized. 
4. Grip MVC: the baseline, measured at the 40th min during cooling and at the 15th min during 
rewarming. 
The software Statistica 7.0 was used for data analysis, the Bonferroni test was used to test paired 
differences for significant factors/interactions, and the level of significance (α) was 0.05. 
2. RESULTS 
2.1 Nut-loosening (Gross Dexterity Evaluation) 
2.1.1 Dexterity 
As to the dexterity, ANOVA result indicates that main effects of gender and duration, as well as their 
interaction, were significant. Figure 2-1 shows the gender×duration interaction on the nut-loosening 
dexterity and reveals that the male dexterity was not reduced significantly until after 2 min of 
immersion, at which point the decrement turned steep. After 18 min of immersion, the decrement in 
dexterity for males became somewhat horizontal. For females, the decrement in dexterity became 
slower after 10 min of immersion. Then it decreased continuously, but not significantly. The maximal 
reductions in dexterity as compared with the baseline were about 55% and 52% for males and 
females, respectively. In the rewarming stage, the dexterity recovered gradually, and finally at the 
12
th
 min, it was equivalent to the baseline for both genders. In general, dexterity decreases 
continuously with prolonged cooling, but a reverse effect occurs with rewarming.  
As to the gender effect on nut-loosening dexterity, the number of nuts loosened completely in 30 sec 
for males was, on average, better than that for females (5.8 vs. 4.8), specifically at baseline and the 
2
nd
 min during cooling. The gender difference was reduced as immersion time increased (refer to 
Figure 2-1).  
2.1.2 EMG (nRMS) 
The gender effect was not significant on nRMS of EMG, but it interacted significantly with both 
main effects of duration and muscle; the duration effect and duration×muscle interaction were also 
significant.  
Figure 2-2 illustrates the duration effect on nRMS of EMG relative to gender and muscle. Figure 
2-2(a), the gender×duration interaction, reveals that the nRMS decreased as the cold immersion was 
 25 
activity on FDS (7.9 %MVC) than on ED (4.3 %MVC), but there was no significant difference for 
females (both were 10.5 %MVC). On average, females (10.5 %MVC) had greater nRMS than 
males (6.1 %MVC).  
2.2.3 Skin temperature 
The significant effects on skin temperature were the main effects of duration and location and 
duration×location interaction; they were the same as those in the nut-loosening task. The 
duration×location interaction is displayed in Figure 2-3(b), in which the influential patterns of both 
duration and location effects on the skin temperatures are somewhat similar to those shown in Figure 
2-3(a). The minimal temperatures occurred at the 34
th
 min in the cooling stage, and they were 12.4, 
13.0, and 17.1
o
C for FST, HST, and FAST, respectively.  
2.3 Grip Strength Measurement 
A total of 12 subjects completed the nut-loosening task, and 12 other subjects completed the 
pin-insertion task. All 24 subjects performed the grip MVC measurement under the same procedure. 
Therefore, all MVC data of these 24 subjects were pooled together for analysis and are presented as 
follows.  
2.3.1 MVC 
The ANOVA result indicated that main effects of gender and duration were significant, but not their 
interaction. Regarding the duration effect (namely at baseline, the 40
th
 min of cooling, and the 15
th
 
min of rewarming), there was a least MVC at the 40
th
-min cold immersion (31.1 kgw), with about 
12% reduction relative to the baseline. At the 15th-minute of rewarming, the MVC returned to the 
baseline (35.3 kgw vs. 35.8 kgw). In addition, males had about 45% greater MVC than females at 
baseline (41.9 kgw vs. 28.7 kgw).  
2.3.2 EMG (nRMS) 
All main effects (gender, duration, and muscle type) as well as duration×muscle interaction were 
significant. A dramatic decrement in nRMS for both ED and FDS occurred at the 40
th
 min in the 
cooling stage (ED=24.7%MVC, FDS=24.9 %MVC; both indifferent), and nRMS recovered to the 
level of baseline after 15-min rewarming (baseline: ED=76.5 %MVC, FDS=55.6 %MVC; 
rewarming: ED=75.7 %MVC, FDS=54.0 %MVC). Except for at the 40
th
 min in the cooling stage, 
there was a greater nRMS on ED than on FDS. For gender effect, a greater nRMS was found on 
females (55.7 %MVC) than on males (48.1 %MVC). 
2.3.3 Skin temperature 
The effects of duration and location, as well as their interaction, were significant. The FAST was the 
highest at both baseline (FAST=34.5
o
C, HST=33.7
 o
C, FST=33.7
 o
C) and the 40
th
 min immersion 
(FAST=16.7 
o
C, HST=12.9
 o
C, FST=11.9
 o
C), but it was the lowest after 15-min rewarming 
(FAST=30.8
o
C, HST=32.9
 o
C, FST=33.7
 o
C). The gender difference was not significant at the 40
th
 
 27 
named nut-loosening and pin-insertion dexterity, respectively. These effects seem to have different 
influences on gross and fine dexterities. 
The gender effect was significant on gross dexterity (nut-loosening), but not on fine dexterity 
(pin-insertion). That is, the gender effect on dexterity was greater on gross than on fine. The gender 
difference on gross dexterity seems to have been masked as immersion time increased (refer to 
Figure 2-1). The possible reasons for males having better gross dexterity are the greater hand/finger 
strength of males (here, grip MVC, males=41.9 kgw vs. females=28.7 kgw) and faster hand 
movement (Rueckriegel et al., 2008). On the other hand, this insignificant gender effect on 
pin-insertion is consistent with that found by Sawyer and Bennett (2006), in which latex gloves were 
also assessed. As to gender effect on EMG, the possible reasons are due to the difference in posture 
adopted, the hand/finger strength, and/or the speed of hand movement. For skin temperatures, on the 
other hand, the insignificance of gender effect during dexterity tasks and the limited difference 
between genders for grip MVC measurement were possibly due to the skin temperatures being 
controlled in the first stage.  
Dexterities, EMG, and skin temperatures fell as cooling was prolonged, but the EMG of FDS 
remained almost unchanged during the nut loosening task. The reason for this undifferentiated FSD 
may be that the intermittent and dynamic exertion required to loosen the nuts can alleviate the 
reduction in muscle temperature, which could then diminish the impact of cold immersion on EMG 
(Sormunen et al., 2006). A gradually reducing/increasing trend in skin temperature at different 
locations during cold/warm immersion is intuitive, and the rate of heat exchange is greatest on the 
finger and least on the forearm. Furthermore, Figure 2-5 demonstrates that the dexterity continuously 
decreased until the cold immersion ended. This pattern is different from that of first decreasing and 
then flattening observed in the nut-loosening task (refer to Figure 2-1). That is, the cooling effects on 
manual dexterity differed somewhat in the grosser and finer dexterity tasks. A reduction in grip MVC 
after cooling is supported by Petrofsky and Lind (1980) and Geurts et al. (2006). Regarding 
rewarming, all responses but the FAST recovered to the baseline level at the end of rewarming. 
There is no denying that hand performance is affected severely by skin temperatures (Schiefer et al., 
1984; Imamura et al., 1998; Ducharme et al., 1999; Brajkovic & Ducharme, 2003; Pilcher et al., 
2002), & manual dexterity has been shown to be hardly influenced by low core temperatures when 
the periphery is kept warm (Gaydos, 1958). More specifically, Table 2-4 reveals that the factor of 
skin temperature is the most influential and positively correlated with both types of dexterity 
among three independent factors, and the contribution of skin temperature to dexterity is about 50%.  
Lockhart (1968) indicated that a cold-induced reduction in manual performance could be attributed 
to changes in the characteristics of the sinovial fluid. Hunter et al. (1952) argued that a reduction in 
finger flexibility at 12
o
C on finger skin was the result of increased resistance in the finger joints. 
Havenith et al. (1995) concluded that the dexterity decrease observed with cold extremities is most 
likely caused by cooling of muscles and joints, and they further indicated that the critical 
 29 
the humidity. Pin-insertion dexterity depends more on tactile sensitivity, which is more sensitive to 
ambient conditions. On the other hand, nut-loosening requires more strength generated from 
muscles; therefore, it is less sensitive to ambient conditions. This fact is supported by Havenith et al. 
(1995), who stated that dexterity will gradually be impaired as hands start to cool, and a greater 
decrement in performance was found as more finger dexterity was needed. 
The change in skin temperatures is a direct effect cooling/warming. When this cooling/warming is 
prolonged, some physiological characteristics inside the hand/forearm could be altered, e.g. 
characteristics of the sinovial fluid, tactile sensitivity, EMG, nerve conduction speed, muscle blood 
flow, and oxygen supply. As a result, during sustained cooling/warming, the hand performance 
varies greatly due to such effects. Unfortunately, these internal changes are difficult to observe and 
measure. However, these physiological characteristics are usually correlated with skin temperature, 
which is easier to measure. Importantly, the influence of finger/hand/forearm skin temperatures on 
hand dexterity is more substantial than that of the core temperature (Gaydos, 1958). Therefore, the 
best policy to avoid impairment in hand performance is to keep the hand/forearm warm.  
Finally, it should be noted that the subjects in this study wore one layer of latex gloves in the 
experiments. Gloves are commonly worn to protect the hands in cold environments. Wearing gloves 
usually affects hand dexterity adversely (Bensel, 1993), and latex gloves are no exception (Neiburger, 
1992). Here, the latex glove was used to slow the heat exchange rate in a 40-min cold immersion and 
to motivate participants, but also to simulate its role in a cold immersion task. On the other hand, no 
formal assessment of the fit of the gloves was performed in the present study; the participants were 
asked to select gloves that fit from six available sizes to wear. Therefore, the possible influence of 
wearing latex gloves on responses evaluated in this study should not be ignored.  
4. CONCLUSIONS 
During a sustained cooling immersion, the influence of gender and the pattern of EMG seem to be 
different between gross and fine dexterity. An obviously continuous reduction/elevation in skin 
temperatures on finger/hand/forearm was observed during sustained cooling/warming immersion. 
Gross/fine hand dexterity, grip strength, and muscular EMG are found to be positively correlated to 
skin temperature. In addition, the three factors identified, extracted by factor analysis, are termed 
skin temperature, ambient condition, and EMG. They can explain most of the variation of the 
multiple-regression models for both the nut-loosening (gross) and pin-insertion (fine) dexterity 
tasks evaluated here, and the factor of skin temperature is found to be the most influential 
contributor among them. Therefore, keeping the hand/forearm warm is essential to maintaining 
hand performance.

is 54×33×27 cm3, and the interior is 49×29×15 cm3.  
2. A submersible cooler made by Firstek Co. (Model: HC-101) was used to cool the water temperature 
from the ambient to -20oC. At 20oC, the cooling efficiency is 750 Kcal/hr. During immersion, it was 
submersed in the water bath to cool the water, and the water temperature was set and regulated by the 
electronic thermo-sensor of the water bath.  
3. A digital thermometer and hygrometer (TECPEL Co.; Model: DTM301) was used to monitor the 
ambient temperature and humidity at the same time. The temperature range measured was from -10 
to +50℃. Relative humidity measured ranges from 20% to 99%. 
4. A digital 4-channel thermometer made by TECPEL Co. (Model: DTM319) with a size of 184×64×30 
(W×D×H) mm3 was used to record skin temperatures. The memory capacity is 16,000 data. The 
sampling rate was set at 6 per minute, and it was connected to a personal computer with an RS-232. 
The temperatures measured range from -200 to 1370℃.  
5. Six plastic boxes with size of 7.3 cm in diameter and 4.3 cm in height were used. All six boxes were 
made visually indistinguishable, so as to avoid the size-weight illusion (Luczak & Ge, 1989). 
1.3 Experimental design 
A nested-factorial design was employed. The independent variable were gender, subject (nested 
within gender), FST (12 and 34℃). The dependent variable was the DL(%). 
1.4 Procedures 
According to the past findings, Ross and Brodie (1987) described DL(%)s that were about 11.8 for 
weight levels at 500 g. Shih and Wang (1996) indicated that the average barehanded DL(%)s for 10 g, 
250 g, 500 kg were 21.28, 9.45, 7.17, respectively. The HST was unknown in their papers, therefore, 
the minimum percentage difference between standard and comparisons should be determined first. 
After try and error, the minimum percentage difference was set at 8%. The weights of the five boxes 
were specified with differences of -16%, -8%, 0%, +8%, and +16% from the standard weight of 250g. 
The weights of plastic boxes were controlled by sand inside. 
All participants were well informed of the goals and procedures prior to the formal measurement. In 
addition, anthropometrics related to the dominant forearm/hand were measured. Finally, the probes 
of the thermometer were attached by sponge tape on the dorsal side of the middle phalanx of the 
middle finger (namely FST), on the middle of the third metacarpal of the dorsal side of the hand 
(namely HST), and on the ED of the forearm (namely FAST). The mean ambient temperature 
(standard deviation, SD) was 19.7°C (1.2°C); the mean relative humidity (SD) was 63.2% (7.3%).  
When to start the measurement, participants sat on a chair without armrests and immersed their right 
(dominant) hands into the water tank up to the elbow joint. The water temperature was set at either 12 
or 34°C and assigned randomly. As soon as the FST reached the specified temperature (12 or 34 °C ), 
subject was instructed to start the stage of DL(%) measurement by means of method of constant 
stimuli. Each comparison between standard box and one of the five comparison boxes was replicated 
 41 
(Morton and Provins, 1960). Furthermore, pressure sensitivity, tactile acuity, and manual 
performance declining with skin temperatures below about 13-16 oC have been well established 
(Brook & Ellis, 1992).  
Another important factor is the influence of cold on nerve conduction velocity. It has been found that 
there is a linear decrease in verve conduction velocity of 1.8m/sec×℃ as nerve temperature between 
36 to 23 ℃. As, except nerve endings, nerves are located in deeper structures which temperature will 
follow skin temperature with a large delay only, it can be concluded that the observed reduction in 
dexterity performance at 15 ℃ skin temperature may in part be due to reduction conductivity. As 
skin receptors are located very close to the surface (within 1-3 mm depth), the threshold for 
performance reduction due to sensor sensitivity decrease must be very close to that for skin 
temperature.  
On the other hand, Synodinos and Ross (1979) indicated that weight discrimination was impaired in 
water of 11 °C in comparison with 27 °C. In cold water the reduction in discrimination is probably 
brought about by lowered tactile sensitivity: apparent weight is coded by the rate of firing of the 
pressure receptors, a lowering of sensitivity or transmission rate of the receptors should lead to a 
reduction in heaviness. 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
The discriminability of weight difference between hand skin temperatures at 34 and 12 ℃ was 
investigated in this paper. When hand skin temperature reduces from 34 ℃ to 12 ℃, the difference 
threshold was increases from 3.60% to 6.96% as the standard weight is 250g.

Ten subjects (5 males and 5 female) took parted in this study. They were free from musculoskeletal 
disorders, and their anthropometric data are shown in Table 4-1.

1.2 Materials and apparatus 
1. A water bath made by Firstek Co. (Model: B102) was used. It can maintain the temperature 
constantly at a desired level with an electronic thermo-sensor and a heater with a resolution of 
0.3℃. The minimum temperature is the ambient temperature plus 5℃, and the maximum is 80
℃. Its exterior (W×D×H) is 54×33×27 cm3, and the interior is 49×29×15 cm3. 
2. A submersible cooler made by Firstek Co. (Model: HC-101) was used to cool the water 
temperature from the ambient to -20℃. At 20℃, the cooling efficiency is 750 Kcal/hr. During 
immersion, it was submersed in the water bath to cool the water, and the water temperature was 
set and regulated by the electronic thermo-sensor of the water bath.  
3. A digital thermometer and hygrometer (TECPEL Co.; Model: DTM301) was used to monitor the 
ambient temperature and humidity at the same time. It has a temperature measurement range of 
-10℃ to +50℃, with a resolution of 0.1℃. The relative humidity measurement range is 20% to 
99% with a resolution of 1%. 
4. A digital 4-channel thermometer made by TECPEL Co. (Model: DTM319), with a size of 
184×64×30 (W×D×H) mm3, was used to record skin temperatures. The memory capacity is 
16,000 data. It has a measurement range of -200 to 1370℃, and its resolution is 0.1℃. The 
sampling rate was set at 6 per minute, and it was connected to a personal computer with an 
RS-232. 
5. A strain gage made by KYOWA (model: PSM-AB; mass<10g) was used to measure the pressure 
attached on the handle of a hand-tool. Its capacity is 200kPa (about 2.04 kgf/cm2). A cylindrical 
bottle weighted 300g with 5 cm in diameter and 16.7 cm in height. Additionally, a metal can 
weighted 1300g controlled by sand.  
6. A pinch gauge with a load cell (SENSOTEC, Model: 81, capacity: 250 lbs, tension) was

1.4 Experimental design 
A nested-factorial design was employed, and the independent variables included gender, subject 
(nested within gender) and timing (8 time points). The dependent variable was as the follows.  
1. peakP  (kPa): the peak force value applied on the bottle during lifting the can. 
2. steady
P
 (kPa): the mean force value of 2-3 sec applied on the bottle for steadily holding the bottle. 
3. The skin temperature (℃), FST, HST, FAST-E, and FAST-F. 
2. RESULTS 
The ANOVA results for peak ( peakP ) and steady ( steadyP  ) force applied measured in terms of pressure 
(kPa) are shown in Table 4-2. It indicates that, except for individual difference, none is significant on  
peakP , and only Gender×Timing interaction is significant on steadyP . Figure 4-2 demonstrates the 
timing effect on steadyP  of both sexes. In general, mean (SD) steadyP  of male is 64.1 (32.5), which is 
smaller that of female (71.0 (36.0)). Furthermore, male steadyP  seems to be more stable than female 
from Figure 4-2, but the coefficient of variation is 50.7% and 50.8% for male and female, 
respectively. Aforementioned seems to imply female has less efficient than male to control hand 
force exertion when hand/arm is cooling.  
As to the skin temperatures, besides the individual difference, timing effect is significant on all the 
skin temperatures of finger, hand, and forearm. Sex effect is significant only on forearm (FAST-E and 
FAST-F). The skin temperatures decrease as the immersion time increases. At the last point, the FST

3. CONCLUSIONS 
Hand/ forearm skin temperatures seem not to shift the hand force modulation significantly. In general, 
female has less force output than male, but a greater steady force applied by female was found. It 
implies that female has less efficient than male to control hand force exertion when hand/arm is 
cooling. It could lead female workers to be prone to a higher risk to musculoskeletal disorders.

1. METHODS 
1.1 Participants 
Sixteen volunteer participants, 8 male (mean age = 30 yr, mean weight = 70.3 kg) and 8 female (mean 
age =26.6 yr, mean weight = 52.7 kg), participated in this experiment. All participants were 
right-handed and free from musculoskeletal disorders. They were informed of purpose of the 
experiment and signed an informed consent form before the experiment.  
1.2 Apparatus and Materials 
The cold pressor test was also employed in this experiment, and all equipments were all the same as 
those employed in Experiment 4: they were the water bath made by Firstek Co. (Model: B102), the 
submersible cooler made by Firstek Co. (Model: HC-101), the digital thermometer and hygrometer 
(TECPEL Co.; Model: DTM301), the digital 4-channel thermometer made by TECPEL Co. (Model: 
DTM319), the strain gage made by KYOWA (model: PSM-AB), and the pinch gauge with a load cell 
(SENSOTEC, Model: 81, capacity: 250 lbs, tension).  
1.3 Procedures and data acquisition 
Prior to the formal measurement, all participants were well informed of the goals and procedures. 
Ambient temperature was controlled at 20~21℃. Next, the probes of the thermometer were attached 
by sponge tape on the dorsal side of the middle phalanx of the middle finger (named FST), on the 
middle of the third metacarpal of the dorsal side of the hand (named HST), and on the muscles of 
extensor digitorums (ED) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) of the forearm (named FAST-E 
and FAST-F, respectively). When all preparations were ready, several practical trials were given to 
familiarize subjects with the formal procedures.  
In the formal measurement, in order to avoid the influence of initial HST on hand performance, all 
subjects were first asked to immerse their dominant hands into a 34℃ water bath until HST reached 
34℃. Next subjects moved their hands out and immersed them into experimental water bath (15℃ 
or 34℃), and after 3 minutes they removed their hands out of water bath for grip MVC measurement 
(denoted as MVC0). They immersed the hands into water bath as soon as completion of MVC 
measurement for 3-min rest. The following was an 18-min repetitive plastic-tube task, which 
consisted of 6 times of 3-min repetitive cutting with cutting frequency of 30 trials/ min. During the 
repetitive task self-reported perceived effort according to Borg’s 10-point scale (denoted as PEi, 
i=1,2,3,4,5,6) and then grip MVC (denoted as MVC i, i=1,2,3,4,5,6) was recorded every 3 min. In addition, the 
force applied on the cutting handtool was also recorded and the mean value of 30 trials in last minute 
of every 3 minutes was taken for data analysis (denoted as )(icutF , i=1,2,3,4,5,6).  
1.4 Experimental design 
A combined design of nested-factorial design and split-plot was employed, and the independent

2.2 MVC 
The ANOVA result indicated that all main effects but HST and interactions of sex*HST, sex* 
cutting/rest schedule, and sex*HST*cutting/rest schedule were significantly. Figure 5-3 
demonstrated the three-factor interaction. As it can be seen, for females, there was no difference 
among the 4 combinations of HST and cutting/rest schedule; for males, 34℃ HST combining 
cutting/rest schedule of 75-15 had greatest MVC. In general, males generated greater MVC. On the 
other hand, MVC descent as operating time increased, which implied longer repetitive operation led 
to more fatigue.

3. CONCLUSIONS 
At lower HST, say 15℃, participants applied greater force, )(icutF , on handtool, especial for males. 
And longer operating time induced a greater )(icutF . A cutting/rest schedule of 150-30 seemed to 
result in a greater muscular fatigue, for with less MVC output. This fact was much obvious for 
males. In addition, more muscular fatigue was found after longer repetitive cutting task. As to RPE, 
longer operation time caused a greater RPE, and females perceived greater RPE than males did.

5Hand performance will gradually be impaired as the hands start to cool, and the level of decrease in performance
depends on the types of tasks. In general, a greater decrement in performance has been found as more finger
dexterity is needed (Havenith et al., 1995). Additionally, Petrofsky and Lind (1980) indicated that cooling the
forearm could cause reductions in muscular co-ordination, nerve conduction speed, and strength. Changes in
muscle performance can affect manual manipulation through changes in power, contraction speed, or muscle
endurance. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine if the hand force modulation is affected by cold
effect.

Materials and apparatus
The cold pressor test was employed in the present study to cool and control skin temperatures. The used materials
and apparatus were as the followings.
1. A water bath made by Firstek Co. (Model: B102) was used. It can maintain the temperature constantly at a
desired level with an electronic thermo-sensor and a heater with a resolution of 0.3oC. The minimum
temperature is the ambient temperature plus 5oC, and the maximum is 80oC. Its exterior (W×D×H) is 54×33
×27 cm3, and the interior is 49×29×15 cm3.
2. A submersible cooler made by Firstek Co. (Model: HC-101) was used to cool the water temperature from
the ambient to -20oC. At 20oC, the cooling efficiency is 750 Kcal/hr. During immersion, it was submersed
in the water bath to cool the water, and the water temperature was set and regulated by the electronic
thermo-sensor of the water bath.
3. A digital thermometer and hygrometer (TECPEL Co.; Model: DTM301) was used to monitor the ambient
temperature and humidity at the same time. It has a temperature measurement range of -10℃ to +50℃,
with a resolution of 0.1℃. The relative humidity measurement range is 20% to 99% with a resolution of
1%.
4. A digital 4-channel thermometer made by TECPEL Co. (Model: DTM319), with a size of 184×64×30 (W×
D×H) mm3, was used to record skin temperatures. The memory capacity is 16,000 data. It has a
measurement range of -200 to 1370oC, and its resolution is 0.1oC. The sampling rate was set at 6 per
minute, and it was connected to a personal computer with an RS-232.
5. A strain gage made by KYOWA (model: PSM-AB; mass<10g) was used to measure the pressure attached
on the handle of a hand-tool. Its capacity is 200kPa (about 2.04 kgf/cm2). A cylindrical bottle weighted
300g with 5 cm in diameter and 16.7 cm in height. Additionally, a metal can weighted 1300g controlled by
sand.
6. A pinch gauge with a load cell (SENSOTEC, Model: 81, capacity: 250 lbs, tension) was fabricated to
measure force output. The span, the distance between the two outside edges of the handles, was set at 5 cm.
It was as large as the diameter of bottle.
7. The strain gage and load cell were connected to a 12-bit A/D converter card, and its linearity was calibrated.
The sampling rate was 1k Hz.
Procedures
7As to the skin temperatures, besides the individual difference, timing effect is significant on all the skin
temperatures of finger, hand, and forearm. Sex effect is significant only on forearm (FAST-E and FAST-F). The
skin temperatures decrease as the immersion time increases. At the last point, the FST is the least (14.5℃),
followed is the HST (16.9℃), and the FSAT (18.9℃, 19.7℃). After the same immersion duration, female had
lower skin temperatures on forearm (FSAT-E: 22.2℃ vs. 23.7℃; FSAT-F: 21.1℃ vs. 22.4℃). In addition, the
is not a significant correlation between FST/HST/FAST and peakP , and steadyP .

genders
Figure 3: The timing effect on finger/ hand/ forearm skin
temperature
CONCLUSION
Hand/ forearm skin temperatures seem not to shift the hand force modulation significantly. In general, female has
less force output than male, but a greater steady force applied by female was found. It implies that female has less
efficient than male to control hand force exertion when hand/arm is cooling. It could lead female workers to be
prone to a higher risk to musculoskeletal disorders.
