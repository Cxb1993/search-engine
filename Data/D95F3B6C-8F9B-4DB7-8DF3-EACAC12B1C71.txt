identified as a fuzzy combination of Takagi-Sugeno 
type linear models; the fuzzy controller is then 
optimized by an evolutionary strategy, the parallel 
genetic algorithms, based on closed-loop control 
performance under various degrees of dynamic 
uncertainties. To ensure stability and H∞ robust 
tracking performance, each candidate fuzzy controller 
is verified by a linear matrix inequality (LMI) testing 
procedure which applies the lately proposed idea of 
the fuzzy Lyapunov function [8], before the fuzzy law 
is applied to the system for tracking performance 
evaluation. 
 2
Moreover, there exist diverse design alternatives in 
the published applications of evolutionary strategies, 
the genetic algorithms (GAs) in particular, such as 
ways of encoding, ranking, crossover and mutation, 
and values of the mutation rate and the crossover rate 
[9]-[10]. These design choices dramatically influence 
the overall performance of the algorithms. In [11], we 
reported an easy-to-implement evolutionary 
architecture based on the island model to exploit the 
explicit parallelism of genetic algorithms using 
parallel processors. The architecture is used in this 
paper to relieve design difficulties in parameter 
selection of genetic algorithms and improve search 
efficiency and consistency at the same time.

The plant under consideration is a type of nonlinear 
system which is affine in the input and contains 
uncertain dynamics:

Furthermore, nonlinear functions  and

Before deriving the fuzzy control rules, we assume 
that the nonlinear system can be represented as a 
fuzzy combination of linear system dynamics and will 
be employed for the tracking control design. Each 
IF-THEN rule in the affine T-S fuzzy model 
represents local dynamics of the nonlinear system. 
Specifically, the i-th rule of the affine T-S fuzzy 
model is in the following form: 
Plant rule i :

In each rule, , ,  and  are the  
premise variables, which can be state variables or 
functions of state variables,  is the fuzzy set 
corresponding to the j-th premise variable, 
is the i-th system matrix, and 
denotes the i-th control input matrix. Note 
that, in the representation,  is the i-th bias 
vector which is the so-called “affine term” in the T-S 
fuzzy model [12], is the i-th system 
uncertainty, and denotes the i-th control 
input uncertainty.

In the above definitions, a is a time constant that 
defines the duration of interested transient stage, 
which must be specified by the user. 
Furthermore, an optimal control design is obtained 
by adding a penalty term for constraining the 
magnitude of controls, sometimes named as minimum

Taking transient and steady tracking performance, 
together with control effort, into consideration, the 
overall performance index, , is then defined as a 
weighted sum of the indices:

where 1ω and 2ω are positive weightings, which must 
be defined based on practical trade-off between 
desired tracking performance and physical constrains. 
 
Remark 1. Theorem 1 offers a sufficient condition 
that, if satisfied, guarantees the tracking performance. 
The optimal control design approach proposed is to 
formalize the search for fuzzy control gains, ’s 
( ) in equation (13), as an optimization 
problem:

Step 3: Determine 1σμ and 2σμ  of equation (9), and 
the weighting matrix, Q, of (15). 
Step 4: Design a stable and well-behaved reference 
model (11) by selecting asymptotically stable 
system matrix . The design should be based 
on performance requirements and achievable 
system bandwidth.

The procedure is formalized as a minimization 
problem: 
Start from a positive value of attenuation 
level, say ρ = 0.99, and find a set of control 
gain matrices, , such that  is 
minimized using an efficient optimization 
technique. In finding the value of Total  
corresponding to a candidate set of gain 
matrices, j , several simulations should be 
conducted with being assigned different 
values, such as 0, -1, 1, or sinusoidal waves. 
Total  is then defined as the largest value of 
(20) in all such simulations. The simulation of 
unstable closed-loop systems can be avoided 
by checking if . When 
the stability condition is not fulfilled, 
Total
 is 
assigned a large number, for instance, 100.

reducing it by a small positive constant, 
denoted as ε , until no ’s exist that can 
satisfy the stability condition, as represented in 
the flowchart of Fig. 1. The LMI problem can 
be facilitated by using, for instance, the Robust 
Control Toolbox LMI functionality of the 
MathWorks, Inc. [7].   
jK
Step 6: Construct the fuzzy controller, (13), and test 
its robustness by extensive experiments or  
simulations. 
Here, the parallel genetic algorithms proposed in 
[11] are applied as the major global optimization 
technique.  
The intrinsic implicit and explicit parallelism 
renders GAs good candidates for parallel processing 
[13-14]. The implicit parallelism is due to the schema 
theory developed by Holland [15], while the explicit 
parallelism arises from the manipulation of a 
population of candidate solutions.  )
In cases A, the controller is designed based on the 
concept of fuzzy Lyapunov function, while a single 
Lyapunov function candidate is used in cases B.  
When applying the evolutionary design procedure 
in cases A, eight sub-populations were used to 
implement the parallel genetic algorithms. The 
migration size of the scheme is 2, and the common 
pool has 16 chromosomes. The crossover rates and 
mutation rates for the islands are: 
=cϖ [0.7, 0.75, 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.5, 0.15, 0.9], and 
=mϖ [0.3, 0.01, 0.22, 0.3, 0.28, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1], 
respectively, and each subpopulation is of size 20. Fig. 
5 shows the history of Score  with respect to 
evolutionary generations. In Fig. 5-(a), the  in 
all of the eight islands of the parallel genetic 
algorithms reaches a saturated value of  in 
30 generations, which is much faster and more 
efficient when compared with that of the independent 
populations that are with different crossover and 
mutation rates but of size 160, as shown in Fig. 5-(b). 
Score
-3102.42 ×
Following the flowchart of Fig. 1, the attenuation 
level, ρ , is decreased at a step size of ε =0.002 to 
minimize the performance index, , and TotalJ ρ  at 
the same time. Fig. 6 shows that the achievable 
performance index is 0.874 when the attenuation level 
is 0.018. Lower than 0.018, the performance index 
rises dramatically. With the Robust Control Toolbox 
LMI functionality of the MathWorks, Inc. [7], the 
evolutionary design procedure of Case A resulted in a 
fuzzy controller, in the form of (13), with the 
following constant gain matrices: 
61.559]  [99.99][ 12111 == KKK , 
, 1.0001]   [99.999][ 22212 == KKK

The tracking performance is achieved with similar 
control efforts, as shown by the time-domain records 
of the control inputs in Fig. 8. 
Also, the weighting factors, 1ω  and 2ω , of the 
performance index, , plays an important role in 
optimizing fuzzy rules. For instance, if the 
corresponding weights are selected as 
TotalJ
11 =ω  and 
01.02 =ω , then the magnitude of control input 
receives less constraint. This is the case shown in Fig. 
9, which demonstrates the change in control efforts 
when different weightings are assigned in the 
performance index. 
In this paper, we propose a new optimal fuzzy 
tracking control design procedure. The procedure 
applies stability condition based on the concept of the 
fuzzy Lyapunov function, a fuzzy blending of 
multiple Lyapunov functions. The stability condition 
is less restrictive than the more traditional Lyapunov 
function candidate approach, due to the requirement 
of a common and diagonal matrix in the latter 
approach. The new approach results in a broader 
solution space of fuzzy control gains that can be 
optimized according to user defined performance 
indices. 
Although the resultant condition can also be 
represented in the LMI format, more design 
parameters are required before the LMI techniques 
can be applied. To work out this difficulty, the design 
procedure is formalized as a minimization problem, 
with inequality robust stability conditions, solved with 
an effective global optimization method, the parallel 
genetic algorithms.  
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
design method, a chaotic tracking control problem is 
investigated. Numerical design and simulation results 
clearly show that the robust fuzzy control design 
scheme outperforms that of a well-known tracking 
control strategy.
