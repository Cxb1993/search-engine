Introduction 
The technique of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) is an important approach to 
artificial receptors [1]. The scheme of this technique is shown in Fig. 1.The technique enables one 
to prepare robust synthetic receptors by carrying out polymerization reactions in the presence of a 
target molecular substrate (template). In this series of studies, we aim to prepare 
surface-imprinted polymer particles for water-soluble molecules by inverse suspension 
polymerization. The scheme of this procedure is shown in Fig. 2. The technique of surface 
imprinting generates imprinted sites on the surface of the particles. Thus, the problem of slow 
diffusion assiociated with the imprinted sites deep inside the polymer matrix can be eliminated. 
In addition, polymeric particles are produced directly without the step of grinding up, the quality 
of the imprinted sites can be well-preserved. The procedure is similar to the one adopted by 
Markowitz and co-workers [2]. However, organic polymer particles will be prepared instead of 
inorganic silica particles. The use of organic polymeric materials has the advantage of being more 
stable than silica particles under harsh conditions such as in basic aqueous solution. In addition, 
the advanced organic synthetic technique allows versatile molecular design for systematic 
investigation. 
In this project, we intend to exploit potential water-soluble crosslinking agents and carry out 
a profound study on the effect of crosslinking agents. It is well established that the extent of 
success of MIP depends largely on the nature of crosslinking agents used [3-6]. Flexibility and 
chain length of crosslinking agents play important roles. Flexibility of the polymer network 
allows the template to enter the cavity and rebind to the binding sites. Also, optimum flexibility is 
crucial to maximize the degree of complementarity towards the template molecules. On the other 
hand, polymer network with too much flexibility and too long a chain length might lose its 
complementarity after the template molecules are removed. Thus, optimum flexibility and 
optimum chain length provide best performance results. In addition, crosslinking agents must 
have sufficient solubility in the solvent used in order to prepare compact high-crosslinked MIPs. 
Ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate has so far proven to be the optimum choice, excellent solubility in 
organic solvent and the best compromise between flexibility and length. Unfortunately, 
ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate can not be used in our research since it is not water soluble.  
So far, the study on the effect of crosslinking agents has been based on the polymerization in 
organic solvents. The study on the system of water-soluble crosslinking agents has never been 
carried out. Furthermore, crosslinking agents play a more important role in this project than in 
conventional MIP. They must have sufficient water solubility, be able to form particles by inverse

ml acetonitrile and was slowly added to the previous prepared solution in 1 hour. The reaction 
mixture was further stirred for another 3 hours at -10℃ and then was filtered. The powders 
obtained were purified by recrystallization through acetonitrile. The yield is 17.1%. The NMR 
spectrum of 1,3-diacrylamido-2-hydroxypropane is shown in figure 3.     
 
Preparation of polymer particles by inverse suspension polymerization  
The following description is one example of particle preparation. The compositions and 
reaction conditions could be varied. In a 20 ml sample vial sealed by a rubber stopper with three 
outlets, a magnetic stirring bar (5mm(diameter)×15mm(length)) was employed and the speed of 
stirring was controlled by a hot plate (Mirak, Barnstead International). Cyclohexane (10 ml) and 
Span 60 (0.044 g) were added to the vial. An aqueous solution of acrylamide, 
1,3-diacrylamido-2-hydroxypropane, water and methanol (0.119 g: 0.2 g: 0.45 ml: 0.15 ml) and 
0.001 g 4, 4’-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) was added. The reaction mixture was purged with 
nitrogen for 5 min and then stirred for 2 min. The temperature of the solution was raised to 55℃ 
to initiate the polymerization. The reaction proceeded under nitrogen at 55±2℃ for 1 hour. The 
resulting polymer particles were washed by cyclohexane, deionized water and acetone. The 
particles were stored in acetone for further investigation by polarizing optical microscope. 
 
Notation 
    In order to facilitate discussion, the following example illustrates the notation used for the 
preparation conditions of the polymer particles. DAHP 40% 70/30 800rpm 9.7mM means that the 
crosslinking agent is 1,3-diacrylamido-2-hydroxypropane, the weight ratio of (monomer + 
crosslinking agent) to (monomer + crosslinking agent + water) is 40 wt%, The molar ratio of 
monomer to (monomer + crosslinking agent) is 70/30, the stirring speed is 800 rpm, and the 
concentration of surfactant is 9,7mM.   
 
Results and Discussion 
The preparation of hydrophilic polymer particles by inverse suspension polymerization 
published in the literature usually employs methylenebisacrylamide as a crosslinking agent. The 
percentage of methylenebisacrylamide tends to be low, below 3 mole％, in order to be used as 
hydrogels to absorb large amount of water. Since we are interested in the preparation of highly 
crosslinked polymer particles at high concentrated solutions for the application to MIPs, we aim 
to increase the percentage of crosslinking agents as much as possible. From our previous study on 
ethylenebisacrylamide (EBA), it was found that polymer particles could be prepared at the 
conditions of EBA 40% 50/50 800rpm 9.7mM mole% and the further increase on the degree of

Self-evaluation 
The synthesis of one of the proposed crosslinking agents, 
1,3-diacrylamido-2-hydroxypropane, was accomplished. The aqueous solubility of DAHP (~24%) 
is better than ethylene bisacrylamide (~14%), as proposed. The preparation of polymer particles 
using DAHP as crosslinking agents was studied thoroughly in terms of polymerization time, the 
ratio of water phase to organic phase, stirring speed, polymerization temperature, the amount of 
initiator, the ratio of methanol to water, the concentration of surfactant and the amount of 
crosslinking agent.
