1. Abstract 
     The study is focused on the structure and properties of TiZrN thin film by 
controlling substrate bias. Thin films are grown using radio frequency magnetron 
sputtering process on Si wafer. Field Emission scanning electron microscope 
(FEG-SEM) is used to characterize the thickness and structure of the deposited TiZrN 
film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to determine the preferred orientation and lattice 
parameter. The precursor results of XRD show that all the coating samples exhibited 
(111) preferred orientation, and the hardness values of TiZrN films were ranging from 
20~40 GPa. The N/TiZr ratios about 1 were measured by Rutherford backscattering 
spectrometer, and the packing factors of TiZrN films can also be obtained by the 
results of RBS. The resistivity measured by four-point probe decreases from 
conditions -20V to -60V and then increases for substrate bias increases from -60V to 
-130V. The resistivity of TiZrN films is contributed from the packing factor. To sum 
up the precursor studies, the TiZrN films which can improve the properties from TiN 
and ZrN is a new ceramic material with higher potential. Following the advance 
process and analysis research, the structure and properties can be correlated and as a 
reference for industry application. 
 
2. Introduction 
     Interest in the growing films of transition-metal nitride has grown considerably 
during the last 20 years. Various metal nitrides have become important in industry, 
science and technology for their attractiveness and useful properties. Among the 4th 
group transition metal nitrides, TiN may have the most successful application in 
industry. In addition, ZrN has attracted attention for its superior corrosion resistance, 
better mechanical properties, and warmer golden color than the corresponding 
properties of TiN film. (Ti,Zr)N coatings demonstrate enhanced properties compared

base pressure of 1.33 × 10-4 Pa using a pumping system consisting of a rotary pump 
and a turbo-molecular pump. The deposition of (Ti,Zr)N thin films was carried out by 
co-sputtering of Ti and Zr targets. The coating temperature was maintained at 400C, 
which was monitored by placing a thermocouple on the back side of the heater during 
deposition, and the substrate temperature was calibrated by another thermocouple 
attaching on the specimen. The negative bias was applied onto the substrate which 
was rotated at a speed of 20 rpm during deposition process. (Ti,Zr)N films were 
prepared in Ar+N2 plasma operated at a pressure of 6.7 ×10-1 Pa.

4.  Results and Discussion 
4.1 Ion bombardment influence during deposition process 
     Thin films of (Ti,Zr)N were deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering 
based on the previous optimum coating conditions (B10) with various negative bias. 
The negative bias voltage ranging from –20 V to –130 V was applied to the substrate. 
The relationship between substrate bias voltage and ion current density is shown in 
Fig. 2. The ion current density increases rapidly as substrate bias is lower than -60V, 
then slightly increases as the critical value about -60V is exceeded. At the substrate 
bias of -60V, the ion current density is close to 0.56 mA/cm2. Table 3 summarizes the 
experimental parameters employed for the film deposition in the present investigation

     The film thickness measured by SEM ranges from 588 to 1827 nm. Fig. 3 
shows that the film thickness decreases with increasing substrate bias at a constant 
deposition time.

Fig. 3 The variations of the thickness with different substrate bias 
 
The atomic packing factor and composition of the film were determined by RBS 
analysis. The RBS result of sample S1 with bias -20V is shown in Fig. 4. The vertical 
axis is the normalized yield, which represents the number of scattering particle. The 
horizontal axis is the channel or energy. The atomic packing factor was calculated 
with a simulation code. The limitations of RBS have to be considered. The resolution 
of RBS can be lowered to several hundred Å of film. However, this method has a 
maximum detecting limit of 1 m, because the curve of Zr will overlap with that of Si 
substrate. Furthermore, there is no physical significance to simulate under 0.5 MeV as 
shown in Fig. 4. The reason is that the scattering cross section is inverse proportional 
to the square of energy, and the scattering cross section is proportional to the number 
of scattering particle. Thus, it can be seen that the result of normalized yield is steeply

The preferred orientation may affect the properties of (Ti,Zr)N film; therefore, it 
is important to study the variation of preferred orientation with different deposition 
conditions. A few theories and hypotheses have been proposed to explain the 
formation of preferred orientation of thin films coated by PVD techniques. However, 
due to the variation of processing parameters with different PVD techniques, it is 
difficult to verify the significance of each specific parameter. 
Fig. 6 are the X-ray diffraction patterns of sample S1~S6 with (Ti,Zr)N coated on 
silicon substrate, scanning from 2θ=30° to 65°.  Beside S1 with bias –20V, (111) 
peak appears for all specimens, which indicate that the specimens have strongly (111) 
preferred orientation.  Theoretically, (220) is the surface with lower energy in 
(Ti,Zr)N and all NaCl-type metal nitrides. For the film exhibiting a (111) preferred

crystalline quality of the (Ti,Zr)N films. This is one of the major advantages of ion 
bombardment. The quality of deposited films is frequently enhanced by the 
bombardment of high-energy ions or neutral atoms and molecules. The ion 
bombardment is correlated to the momentum transfer or the energy deposited in a 
certain volume on the surface.  This momentum transfer or energy deposition can 
facilitate the adatoms movement on the surface to the equilibrium lattice site and 
therefore enhance the crystallinity of the film.

4.3 Properties of (Ti,Zr)N films with negative substrate bias 
Fig. 12 displays the variation of electric resistivity of (Ti,Zr)N films with 
different substrate bias. From this figure, it can be seen that the resistivity decreases 
(from 152.1 to 66.6 µΩ-cm) with increasing negative substrate bias from –20V 
to –60V. At high substrate bias of –60V to –120V, the value of resistivity rapidly 
increases to 154.9 µΩ-cm. The results clearly indicate that the resistivity of (Ti,Zr)N 
thin film is sensitive to the substrate bias.   
The resistivity versus packing factor is shown in Fig. 13 It is found that the 
highest packing factor corresponds to the lowest resistivity. Consequently, the 
resistivity is related to the lattice defects in the (Ti,Zr)N film.  Therefore, the 
resistivity can be used as an index to evaluate the quality of the (Ti,Zr)N film. 
Proper ion bombardment may enhance the mobility of the adatoms to stable site on 
the substrate surface. It will decrease the resistivity and increase the crystalline quality. 
However, a high bias ion beam may induce radiation damage to the growing film and 
produce lattice defects. The resistivity consequently increases with increasing number 
of defects.

5. Conclusion 
The momentum increases rapidly as the substrate bias is above ﹣60 V, and then 
slightly increases until ﹣120 V. The total energy critical point is at ﹣60 V, and then 
the total energy increases rapidly. Energy of the impinging Ar ions will increase the 
energy of surface adatoms and thus would facilitate their diffusion to more energy 
stable sites on the substrate surface. However, the highly energized plasma particles 
may also induce adverse effects, such as irradiation damage, re-sputtering effect, and 
lattice defects.The resistivity and hardness of thin film relates to the packing density 
and lattice defects.
