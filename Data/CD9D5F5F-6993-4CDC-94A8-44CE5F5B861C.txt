研究摘要 
在本產學案中，我們擬提出了一個新的基於像素組置換 (pixel pair matching, PPM) 
的資訊隱藏技術。PPM 的基本做法是以一組像素值為座標，並在此座標的
neighborhood set 中找尋要嵌入之機密數字的座標，然後將像素組的值置換成所找
到的座標。Exploiting Modification Direction (EMD) 與 Diamond Encoding (DE) 均
是基於 PPM 而發展出來技術，但 EMD 的最大載量只有 1.161 bpp。DE 雖然改進
了 EMD 低載量的缺點，但其載量受限於參數 k，因此無法針對指定的資料長度嵌
入較佳的進位數。我們的方法不但解決了 EMD 無法提高載量的問題，同時也可以
嵌入任意進位的數字。初步實驗結果顯示，與 DE 相比，在低載量 時，我
們的方法可得到與 DE 相同的 MSE，但在高載量 ( 時，我們的方法可得到較
小的 MSE。若與著名的 Optimal Pixel Adjustment Process (OPAP) 相比，無論嵌入
幾個 LSB，我們的方法所得到的 MSE 也低於 OPAP 的 MSE。本產學案將與麗文文

A Novel Data Embedding Method Using 
Adaptive Pixel Pair Matching 
Wien Hong and Tung-Shou Chen 
 
Abstract—This paper proposes a new data hiding method based 
on pixel pair matching (PPM). The basic idea of PPM is to use the 
values of pixel pair as a reference coordinate, and search a 
coordinate in the neighborhood set of this pixel pair according to a 
given message digit. The pixel pair is then replaced by the 
searched coordinate to conceal the digit. Exploiting modification 
direction (EMD) and diamond encoding (DE) are two data hiding 
methods proposed recently based on PPM. The maximum 
capacity of EMD is 1.161 bpp and DE extends the payload of DE 
by embedding digits in a larger notational system. The proposed 
method offers lower distortion than DE by providing more 
compact neighborhood sets and allowing embedded digits in any 
notational system. Compared with optimal pixel adjustment 
process (OPAP) method, the proposed method always has lower 
distortion for various payloads. Experimental results reveal that 
the proposed method not only provides better performance than 
those of OPAP and DE, but also is secure under the detection of 
some well-known steganalysis techniques.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Data hiding is a technique that conceals data into a carrier 
for conveying secret messages confidentially [1],[2]. 
Digital images are widely transmitted over Internet; therefore, 
they are often served as a carrier for covert communication. 
Images used for carrying data are termed as cover images and 
images with data embedded are termed as stego images. After 
embedding, pixels of cover image will be modified and the 
distortion occurs. The distortion caused by data embedding is 
called the embedding distortion [3]. A good data hiding method 
should be capable of evading the visual and statistical 
detections [4] while providing an adjustable payload [5].  
The least significant bit substitution method, referred to as LSB 
in this paper, is a well-known data hiding method. This method 
is easy to implement with low CPU cost, and has become one of 
the popular embedding techniques. However, in LSB 
embedding, the pixels with even values will be increased by 
one or kept unmodified. The pixels with odd values will be 
decreased by one or kept unmodified. Therefore, the 
imbalanced embedding distortion emerges and is vulnerable to 
steganalysis [6], [7]. In 2004, Chan et al. [8] proposed a simple 
and efficient optimal pixel adjustment process (OPAP) method 
to reduce the distortion caused by LSB replacement. In their 
method, if message bits are embedded into the rightmost r 
LSBs of a m-bit pixel, other  bits are adjusted by a simple 
evaluation. Namely, if the adjusted result offers a smaller 
distortion, these 
m r
m r  bits are either replaced by the adjusted 
result or otherwise kept unmodified.  
The LSB and OPAP methods employ one pixel as an 
embedding unit, and conceal data into the rightmost r LSBs. 
Another group of data hiding methods employs two pixels as an 
embedding unit to conceal a message digit Bs  in a B-ary 
notational system. We term these data hiding methods as the 
pixel pair matching (PPM). In 2006, Mielikainen [9] proposed 
a LSB matching method based on PPM. He used two pixels as 
an embedding unit. The LSB of the first pixel is used for 
carrying one message bit, while a binary function is employed 
to carry another bit. In Mielikainen’s method, two bits are 
carried by two pixels. There are 3/4 chance a pixel value has to 
be changed by one yet other 1/4 chance no pixel has to be 
modified. Accordingly, the MSE is 23 14 2 0. 
D 
375  when 
payload is 1 bpp [9]. In contrast, the MSE obtained by LSB is 
0.5. In the same year, Zhang and Wang [10] proposed an 
exploiting modification direction (EMD) method. EMD 
improves Mielikainen’s method in which only one pixel in a 
pixel pair is changed one gray scale unit at most and a message 
digit in a 5-ary notational system can be embedded. Therefore, 
the payload is 1 22 log 5  1.161 bpp. LSB matching and EMD 
methods greatly improve the traditional LSB method in which a 
better stego image quality can be achieved under the same 
payload. However, the maximum payloads of LSB Matching 
and EMD are only 1 and 1.161 bpp, respectively. Hence, these 
two methods are not suitable for applications requiring high 
payload.   
The limited payload of LSB matching and EMD offers no 
mechanism to increase the payload. In 2008, Hong et al. [11] 
presented a data hiding method based on Sudoku solutions to 
achieve a maximum payload of 1 22 log 9  bpp. In 2009, Chao et 
al. [12] proposed a diamond encoding (DE) method to enhance 
the payload of EMD further. DE employs an extraction 
function to generate diamond characteristic values (DCV), and 
embedding is done by modifying the pixel pairs in the cover

After that, the coordinates belong to the set ( , )x y  are 
searched and DE finds a coordinate ( , )x y   
satisfying ( , ) Bf x y s   , and then ( , )x y  is replaced by ( , )x y  . 
Repeat these procedures until all the message digits are 
embedded. In the extraction phase, pixels are scanned using the 
same order as in the embedding phased. The DCV value of a 
pixel pair ( , )x y   is then extracted as a message digit.  
Here is a simple example. Let  and3k  ( , ) (12,1x y 0) , 
then . The neighborhood set 
 and its corresponding DCV values are shown in Fig. 
1. If a digit in a 25-ary notational system  needs to be 
embedded, then in the region defined by , we find the 
DCV value of =14. Therefore, we simply 
replace (1  by (1  and the digit 14  is embedded. To 
extract the embedded digits, we calculate 
, the calculation 
result 14 is then the embedded digit.

III. ADAPTIVE PIXEL PAIR MATCHING 
The basic idea of PPM-based data hiding method is to use 
pixel pair ( , )x y  as the coordinate, and searching a coordinate 
( , )x y   within a predefined neighborhood set ( , )x y  such 
that ( , ) Bf x y s   , where f is the extraction function and Bs  is 
the message digit in a B-ary notational system to be concealed. 
Data embedding is done by replacing ( , )x y  with ( , )x y  . 
For a PPM based method, suppose a digit Bs  is to be 
concealed. The range of Bs  is between 0 and 1B  , and a 
coordinate ( , )x y   ( , )x y
)
 has to be found such that 
( , Bf x y  s
( , )
. Therefore, the range of  must be 
integers between 0 and , and each integer must occurs at 
least once. Besides, to reduce the distortion, the number of 
coordinates in 
( , )yf x
1B
x y  should be as small as possible. The best 
PPM method shall satisfy the following three requirements: (1) 
There are exactly B coordinates in ( , )x y . (2) The values of 
extraction function in these coordinates are mutually exclusive. 
(3) The design of ( , )x y  and should be capable of 
embedding digits in any notational system so that the best B can 
be selected to achieve lower embedding distortion.  
( , )f x y
DE is a data hiding method based on PPM. DE greatly 
enhances the payload of EMD while preserving acceptable 
stego image quality. However, there are several problems. 
Firstly, the payload of DE is determined by the selected 
notational system, which is restricted by the parameter k; 
therefore, the notational system cannot be arbitrarily selected. 
For example, when k is 1, 2, and 3, then digits in a 5-ary, 13-ary, 
and 25-ary notational system are used to embed data, 
respectively. However, embedding digits in a 4-ary (i.e., 1 bit 
per pixel) or 16-ary (i.e., 2 bits per pixel) notational system are 
not supported in DE. Secondly, ( , )x y  in DE is defined by a 
diamond shape, which may lead to some unnecessary distortion 
when . In fact, there exists a better 2k  ( , )x y
( , )
 other than 
diamond shape resulting in a smaller embedding distortion. In 
the following sub-section, we redefine x y  as well as 
 and then propose a new embedding method based on 
PPM. The proposed method not only allows concealing digits 
in any notational system, but also provides the same or even 
smaller embedding distortion than DE for various payloads. 
( ,f x )y
A. Extraction Function and Neighborhood Set 
The definitions of ( , )x y  and ( , )f x y  significantly affect 
the stego image quality. The designs of ( , )x y  and ( , )f x y  
have to fulfill the requirements: all values of ( , )f x y  in 
( , )x y  have to be mutually exclusive, and the summation of 
the squared distances between all coordinates in ( , )x y  and 
( , )x y  has to be the smallest. This is because, during 
embedding, ( , )x y  is replaced by one of the coordinates in 
( , )x y . Suppose there are B coordinates in ( , )x y , i.e., 
digits in a B-ary notational system are to be concealed, and the 
probability of replacing ( , )x y  by one of the coordinates in 
( , )x y  is equivalent. The averaged MSE can be obtained by 
averaging the summation of the squared distance between 
( , )x y  and other coordinates in ( , )x y . Thus, given a ( , )x y , 
the expected MSE after embedding can be calculated by

A. Analysis of Theoretical MSE  
In this section, we analyze the averaged MSE of LSB, OPAP, 
DE and APPM so that the stego image quality obtained from 
each method can be theoretically measured. When data are 
embedded using r LSBs of each pixel, each bit valued 0 or 1 has 
equal probability. The squared error caused by embedding a bit 
in i-th LSB is 1 212 (2 )

embedding r LSBs is given by

LSB and OPAP employ every pixel in the cover image as an

erefore, the payload is r bpp. For the PPM based embedding 
method, a payload with r bpp is equivalent to embedding 2r bits 
for every two pixels, which is equivalent to concealing digits in 
a 22 -aryr  notational system. Because DE does not allow 
embedding digits with exactly in a 22 -aryr  notational system, 
we e the MSE of APPM with LSB and OPAP first. The 
results are shown in Table 2. Note tha sults listed in Table 
2 are obtained by using Eq. (2)-(5), i.e., the theoretically value 
of MSE. A very similar result can also be obtained if these 
methods are applied in nature images.

Tables 4-6 reveal that the performance of the proposed 
APPM method is the best under various payloads. For example, 
with the payload 400,000 bits, the averaged MSE of 2-bit 
OPAP is 1.244, whereas the averaged MSE of DE is 0.887. 
However, the proposed method has the smallest averaged MSE, 
0.640. For larger payload, such as 650,000 and 1,000,000 bits, 
the proposed method also performs better than OPAP and DE 
because APPM selects the smallest notational system that 
provides just enough embedding capacity to accommodate the

V. SECURITY ANALYSIS 
The goal of steganography is to evade the statistical 
detection. It is apparent that MSE is not a good measure of 
security against the detection of steganalysis. For example, the 
low-MSE embedding such as the LSB replacement is known to 
be highly detectable [1], [6]. In this section, we analyze the 
security of APPM under two statistical steganalysis schemes,

ethod for detecting stego images with 
low-amplitude independent stego signal, while HVDH scheme 
is used to detect the presence of hiding message according to 
the distance between vertical and horizontal histograms. All the 
test images used in this section are obtained from the UCID [21] 
and RSP [22] image database, where some literatures [13], [23] 
also adopt this database for their experiments. 
 
A. A. Security Analysis under SPAM 
SPAM is a modern technique for detecting stego images with 
independent random stego signal for which typically not found 
in natural digital images [18]. SPAM obtains the features of 
images by calculating the transition probabilities along eight 
directions, and the number of features is determined by the 
support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel is 
employed to implement the steganalyzer. The e

is calculated to evaluate the security of a data hiding method 
against the detection of SPAM, where FpP  and FnP  is the 
probability of false positive and false negative, respectively. 
The higher the error rate, the lower the detectability.  
To evaluate the detectability of APPM using SPAM, we 
trained the SPAM steganalyzer on images obtained from UCID 
and RSP image databases, respectively. UCID consists of 1,338 
uncompressed images with size . RSP consists of 
10,000 grayscale images with size  coming from 
512 384
512 5 12
cropped and resized natural images. The implementation of 
SPAM features is obtained from [24]. The five-fold 
cross-validation is employed to compute the classification error. 
The simulated annealing (SA) optimization is used to find the 
penalization parameter C and the kernel parameter   such that 
the error rate is the lowest.  
Because SPAM is effective to detect the 1  embedding 
methods such as LSB Matching (LSB-M), which randomly 
increases or decreases the pixel val e for matching the 
LSBs with the message bits, we use the SPAM steganalyzer to 
detect the APPM in 4, 5, and 9-ary notational systems and LSB 
Matching (LSB-M) method with the payloads 0.25 and 0.5 bpp. 
Note that for both LSB-M method and APPM with these 
notational systems, the pixel values of each embedding unit are 
modified at most by one. The results are shown in Table 7 and 8, 
respectively.

As shown in Table 7 and 8, the error rates obtained by the 
APPM method are significant higher than those obtained by the 
LSB-M, indicating that APPM is less detectable than LSB-M 
under the same payload. For example for the UCID image 
database with payload 0.25 bpp, the error rate of LSB-M using 
the 2nd order SPAM is 0.039, while error rate of APPM with
