Abstract
A new silicon-based sharp waveguide bend in asymmetric metal/multi-insulator configuration is described.
TE and TM modes are calculated rigorously electromagnetically from which the general design rules are derived.
Numerical simulations show that the respective insertion losses of < 0.085 dB and < 0.229 dB for TE and TM
modes can be achieved by introducing a low-index layer between the metal and high-index core. The bending
length is in general determined by the TE mode and has much smaller impacts on the TM mode that exhibits no
resonance-like behavior as does the TE. The TE radiation power is shown to couple back to the Si core through an
asymmetric output taper structure, yielding a high end-to-end transmission efficiency. Structure-enabled successive
photonic-plamsonic mode conversions are shown to increase the TM mode confinement in the high-index core
while the plasmonic mode carries up to 42.6% of the input power along the bending section.

I. INTRODUCTION
High-index contrast dielectric waveguides have been in widespread use for many years as they offer a
strong mode confinement, dense integration, low propagation loss (if smooth sidewalls are attainable),
and the ease of fabrication through mature semiconductor technologies. However, further downscaling
waveguiding structures for the realization of optical nanocircuitry is hampered by the natural diffraction
limit and strong sub-wavelength field confinement thus becomes crucially important. Nanophotonics
using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) that can be guided by metallic subwavelength structures beyond
diffraction limit is now considered as a promising solution for the implementation of optical nanocircuitry
[1], [2].
For either long-term developed dielectric- or emerging plasmonics-based photonic devices and circuits,
the waveguide bend is one of the most important building blocks and has been attracted continued attention
for the last 40 years [3], [4], [5]. Among various bend designs, air trenches etched into the substrate have
been extensively investigated in high- and low-index-contrast material systems [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11],
[12], [13]. Corner mirrors formed by deeply-etched reflecting facets, on the other hand, are often found
in rib/ridge waveguides [14], [15], [16]. Alternatively, low-Q resonant cavity [14], [17] and the use of a
photonic crystal region as a 90◦ corner [18] have also been thoroughly studied. In contrast, plasmonics-
based waveguide bends using a simple metal-dielectric-metal waveguide [19], metal micrograting as Bragg
mirrors [20], V-groove at 30◦ in silver with a wedge pillar defect in the corner[21], dielectric-loaded SPP
[22], and 3-D metallic slot waveguides [5] have also been reported in the literature.
Over the years, the research and developments in sharp waveguide bends have long been restricted
exclusively to either dielectric- or plasmonic-based material systems. Because of their ultrasmall footprints,
low-Q resonant cavity [17] and some corer mirror designs [14] may be most well-suited for high-density
photonic integrations. However, they were investigated strictly for TE polarization and according to our
studies [3-nm grid size and a slab mode excitation in two-dimensional (2-D) numerical simulations at

The concept of incorporating a metallic material in Si-based sharp waveguide bends originates from
different modal characteristics associated with TE and TM modes at the metal-dielectric boundary. The
idea is to have the plasmonic mode carry a portion of the TM modal energy that is initially confined
in the Si core and to confine the TE mode by means of a metal/low-index-dielectric boundary acting
as a reflection plane. By investigating the structure parameters analytically and numerically, including
input taper length lin, lengths of linear sections l1 and l2, bending length lbend, bending width wbend,
output taper length lout, and the lateral offsets δoffset,in and δoffset,out associated with the respective input
and output tapers, we show that a polarization-insensitive subwavelength sharp waveguide bend could be
implemented with the present metal/multi-insulator configuration.
III. DISPERSION RELATIONS OF TE AND TM EIGENMODES
The TE and TM dispersion relations from which the effective mode indexes of guided modes (Neff =√
ǫeff) are obtained are the most important equations in describing the guidance characteristics associated
with the proposed waveguide. The 2-D schematic (top view) of a general metal/multi-layer structure
is depicted in Fig. 2. Each layer is characterized by its thickness hi and relative permittivity εi, i =
{m, 1, 2, · · · , n}, where the subscript m stands for the metal. For the case presented in Fig. 1, ε1, ε2,
and ε3 correspond to the relative permittivities of silica, Si, and air, respectively (ε1 = εsilica, ε2 = εSi,
ε3 = 1.0). For simplicity, both metal (εm) and the bottommost dielectric (εn) layers are assumed to be
semi-infinite in extent.
Fig. 2. Schematic of a general metal/multi-insulator waveguiding structure.
The general dispersion relation can be obtained conveniently based upon the transmission-line network
approach incorporated with the transverse resonance condition
Zup + Zdn = 0, (1)
where Zup and Zdn denote the input impedance seen looking upward and downward from the reference
plane, respectively. The characteristic impedance Z0,i of the transmission line associated with the i-th
layer is given by
Zi =
{
ωµ0/κi TE mode
κi/(ωǫ0εi) TM mode,
(2)
in which ω is the angular frequency, µ0 the free-space permeability, ǫ0 the free-space permittivity, and
κi = (2π/λ0)
√
εi − ǫeff is the complex propagation constant of the transmission line associated with
the i-th layer. Notice that κi is in the direction transverse to the layer interface, or equivalently, to the
direction of propagation.
The input impedance seen looking downward from the reference plane can be calculated successively,
starting from the bottommost, semi-infinite region, with the following general equation
FINAL REPORT FOR NSC NSC 100-2221-E-008-061 5
P = (Z0 + Z2) + (Z0 − Z2)e−j2κ2h2 (15)
Q = (Z0 + Z2)− (Z0 − Z2)e−j2κ2h2 . (16)
Equations (9) and (10) can then be numerically solved for the complex effective refractive index Neff
using the complex Newton’s method [23]. The effective mode index will be used in section 4 in developing
the design rules for the proposed sharp bend.
IV. DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION
A systematic approach, starting with the input linearly-tapered section, was taken in the design and
optimization of the proposed sharp bend. In this approach, the entire structure was divided into several
building blocks, each of which was successively optimized. The design, optimization, and their physical
reasonings are described below.
A. Input Linearly-Tapered Section
The input taper is described by the taper length lin and the lateral offset δoffset,in defined as δoffset,in ≡
x1−xin, which is the x-position difference between the center line of the linear section and that of the input
waveguide (Fig. 1). Figure 3 shows the isometric plots of the transmission (coefficient) as a function of
lin and δoffset,in for both mode types. For the TE mode, the silver-silica boundary effectively resembles a
reflection plane with a minimal field penetration. Accordingly, TE behaviors along the linear and linearly-
tapered sections would be very similar to that along an asymmetric, single-layer slab waveguide. Hence,
as is seen in Fig. 3(a), for all lin values under consideration, their respective transmissions are only slightly
skewed toward negative δoffset,in and are nearly identical at δoffset,in = −10 nm, which is close to the
zero-offset point. The highest TE transmission falls within δoffset,in = [10, 35] nm for lin ≤ 900 nm.

Fig. 3. Transmission coefficient of (a) TE and (b) TM modes with varying input taper length lin and input lateral offset δoffset,in ≡ x1−xin
(Fig. 1). The highest transmissions for TE and TM modes are 88.24% and 96.36% at (lin, δoffset,in) = (700, 30) and (lin, δoffset,in) =
(900, 5) nm, respectively.
A positive δoffset,in is required for the TM mode to compensate for a shorter lin in order to maintain
> 90% TM transmission at the end of input taper. However, its functionality becomes minimum for
lin ≥ 800 nm for both mode types. Further investigations show that, for lin > 700 nm, the TM power
channeled in the silica gap varies merely within 2.79% over the span of δoffset,in (not shown in the figure).
This indicates that the phase matching condition is fulfilled and is hardly altered with varying lin if lin is
sufficiently large. The parameters lin and δin are thus chosen to be 700 nm and 45 nm, respectively, for
maintaining transmissions of 88.18% and 96.09% for the respective TE and TM modes at a position 300

were obtained (Table I). Notice that with the increase in wbend, the imaginary part of the effective index
(Im [Neff]) decreases and the real part (Re [Neff]) increases as more electromagnetic energy is confined
within the Si core region. These results are shown to be significant in understanding the transmission
behaviors discussed below.
For the TE mode, transmission valleys exist for wbend ≥ 310 nm owing to the resonance-like field
behavior. The z-component of the electric field Ez is shown as an inset in Fig. 5(a) for (wbend, lbend) =
(350, 250) nm as a representative case. It exhibits a standing-wave-like pattern between the beginning
of the input waveguide and the end of the bending section. However, as the forward- and backward-
propagating fields do not form a perfect standing wave, the field amplitude is nonzero at those node-like
positions, yielding a nonzero transmission through the bend. On the other hand, the bending efficiency is
larger than 90% for lbend ≥ 0.85λg,TE, if wbend ≥ 310 nm, which is one-fifth of the operating wavelength.
For the TM mode, an allowable range of lbend between which the bending efficiency is above 95% is
observed. For a fixed lbend value, the bending efficiency is progressively increased as the bending width
increases. This may be physically interpreted from the effective length standpoint where, with a larger
wbend value, a longer effective bending length in terms of the guided wavelength (lbend/λg) is seen by the
guided mode. In addition, the highest bending efficiency associated with each case in Fig. 5(b) occurs
when lbend ≈ 0.85λg,TM. However, the bending efficiency stays above 90% for lbend > 0.40λg,TM if wbend is

As is shown in Fig. 6(b), it is immediately apparent that the power intensity varies within the Si
core and silica gap along the direction of propagation, suggesting a power interchange exists between
these two regions. The investigation of power interchange (or photonic-plasmonic mode conversion in the
case presented) is therefore necessary in gaining physical insight into the waveguiding structures of this
kind. However, before further investigations could be made on the sharp waveguide bend, it is helpful and
perhaps equally important to first understand the mode conversions associated with its straight counterpart.

in the straight case. As the Si core width increases from B-F to B′-G cuts, the power inside the core
also increases while that in the silica gap decreases. Compared to that along the linear taper, a relatively
weaker power transfer is observed over the span of the bending section. This is due to a larger phase
mismatch as a direct consequence of a larger core width. Likewise, the decrease in PSi and the increase
in Psilica from C ′-H to C-I cuts stem from the decreasing Si core width. Hence the power interchange
between PSi and Psilica merely reflects the inevitable energy redistribution in order to fulfill the guidance
condition for the TM mode in each section. As a result, the structure-enabled successive mode conversions
in reality increase the modal power within the Si core and have the plasmonic mode carry up to 46.2%
of the input power along the bending section.
VI. SUMMARY
A new polarization-insensitive sharp waveguide bend in asymmetric, 2-D metal/multi-insulator config-
uration has been detailed. The transmission through the bending section is assisted to a large extent by the
plasmonic mode for the TM-polarized field and by the metal/low-index-dielectric boundary that resembles
a reflection plane for the TE. These could only be achieved by introducing a low-index dielectric between
the metal and high-index core regions. The dispersion relations governing the guided TE and TM modes
in a general metal/multi-insulator waveguide have been developed and subsequently used in seeking the
design rules for the waveguide bend in terms of the free-space/TE/TM guided wavelengths. The insertion
loss of the proposed sharp bend is shown to be < 0.085 dB for TE and < 0.229 dB for TM. The power
interchange study reveals that more than 10.10% of the TE radiation power is shown to couple back to the
conventional Si waveguide through the output taper section, leading to a high end-to-end TE transmission.
Photonic-plasmonic mode conversions are shown to occur for the TM mode at each structure discontinuity
along the bend, giving rise to an increase in the photonic mode confinement while having the plasmonic
mode carry the rest of the input power that would otherwise give up in the absence of the metal.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
The advances in nanotechnologies have made the 
implementation of photonic integrated circuits (ICs) at deep 
submicron/nanoscale possible in recent years. Featuring strong 
field confinement in dimensions smaller than the diffraction 
limit, plasmonic waveguide devices have presented what might 
be the most promising solution in realizing optical 
nanocircuitry. 
Despite their inherent sub-wavelength guidance capability, 
plasmonic waveguides suffer from high propagation loss due 
mainly to the energy dissipation in the conductor (ohmic loss) 
[1]. This limits their propagation length from a few to hundreds 
of microns at best, depending on the operating wavelength 
(s 30 ¹m in visible and s 300 ¹m in near infrared). On the 
other hand, nowdays the silicon (Si) core of a single-mode 
waveguide operating in optical telecommunication bands can 
be only a few hundred nanometers. For example, the state-of-
the-art strip waveguide with a cross-sectional area of 
200£ 400 nm2 [2] has been experimentally demonstrated. In 
view of bringing light from long-haul optical networks into  
nanoscale photonic ICs, combining the advantages from both 
dielectric- and plasmonic-based structures, which may be 
complimentary to each other in nature, could pave the way 
toward high-performance, ultrahigh-density optical 
nanocircuitry in the future. 
Symmetric metal/multi-insulator/metal and asymmetric 
metal/multi-insulator (MMI) structures have been explored in 
the design of low loss, ultracompact plasmonic Bragg gratings 
[3, 4] and 90± waveguide bends for optical nanocircuitry [5]. In 
this paper, a new polarization splitter (PS) based on an 
asymmetric metal/multi-insulator directional coupler (DC) is 
proposed and investigated. Advantages and performance of this 
novel PS as well as its fabrication tolerance are revealed and 
briefly discussed. 
II. DESIGN PRINCIPLES 
The proposed PS is depicted schematically in Fig. 1. It is a 
DC-based design with one arm (guide B) being in asymmetric 
silicon/silica/silver configuration and the other a simple Si 
waveguide (guide A). The respective refractive indices of Si, 
silica, and silver are nSi = 3:5 , nsilica = 1:46 , and 
nAg = 0:1441¡ j11:2141 at a free-space wavelength 
¸0 = 1550 nm. The background material is assumed to be air. 
The silica gap width wgap is set to 100 nm. The guided mode 
supported by the composite guide B is excited by a 450-nm-
wide Si waveguide followed by a linear taper of length lin. The 
Si core width along the straight section of guide B is 200 nm, 
whereas the silver region is 300-nm-wide throughout the 
device. Due to limited computational resources, a 2-D 
electromagnetic problem was assumed in both analytical 
calculations and numerical simulations. 
The modal birefringence associated with the asymmetric 
MMI configuration is critical to the PS design as it presents 
what might be the only enabling mechanism for the 
polarization splitting in DC-based configuration. In the 
structure presented above, it is shown that the effective index 
of the TM mode (Ne®;TM) is a strong function of the silica gap 
width. The largest modal birefringence occurs when the silver 
region is completely removed but is inevitably accompanied by 
a minimum TM field confinement. Since Ne®;TE is larger than 
Ne®;TM by a large margin of more than 0.696 for wgap ¸ 100 
nm and beyond, the coupling length of the TE polarization is 
significantly shorter than that of the TM. Consequently, the 
cross path is intended for the TE propagation while the through 
path is for the TM. The performance of the present PS may be
