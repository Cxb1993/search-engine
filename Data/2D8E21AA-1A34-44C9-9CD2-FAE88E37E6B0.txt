InP/InGaAs SHBTs. However, a major problem for 
DHBTs is the carrier blocking effect, which occurs at 
the abrupt B-C junction. DHBTs with various B-C 
designs have been studied to solve this problem. 
These include an InP/InGaAs or InAlAs/InGaAs 
chirped superlattice (CSL) linear-graded B-C designs 
[15-17], quaternary step graded InGaAsP B-C 
junction [18] and a composite collector [19], [20]. 
Double HBTs (DHBTs) with wide-gap InP or InAlAs 
collectors improve the breakdown properties, but are 
limited by collector current blocking, because of the 
ΔEC at the base-collector (B-C) junction. Variations 
in the offset voltages (VCE,offset) of heterojunction 
bipolar transistors against base current IB caused by 
the emitter resistance have been investigated [1]. 
However, for asymmetric and complex devices, such 
as a composite-collector DHBT (CC-DHBT), 
VCE,offset has an additional dependence on IB which is 
not observed in a conventional HBT. The zero 
collector current offset voltage of a CC-DHBT 
depends on numerous parameters, complicating our 
understanding of the variation of VCE,offset with IB. 
Numerous passivation schemes for III-V material 
have already been explored [21], [22],  each of which 
has strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, although 
at present a substantial amount of information on the 
operation of HBTs at various temperatures is 
presently available [23], no datum is available on the 
operation of simultaneously temperature- and 
bias-dependent InP/InGaAs HBTs without or with 
various forms of passivation. A study of the variation 
of current gain, β, in CC-DHBT is thus crucial to 
understanding its thermal and bias instability 
behaviors. Accordingly, this work seeks to elucidate 
how the characteristics of the CC-DHBTs vary with 
temperature and current before and after passivation. 
 
II. Experimental details 
The epitaxial layers used in this investigation 
were grown by metal-organic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD) on (100) semi-insulating 
InP:Fe substrates. They were grown in a low-pressure 
(80 Torr) reactor. The growth temperature was 650OC. 
Growth was carried out with arsine and phosphine 
precursors, along with Trimethylindium and 
trimethylgallium. The epitaxial layers were a 0.3 μm 
n+-InP layer doped at n+=5x1018 cm-3, a 0.3 μm n--InP 
layer doped at n=5x1016 cm-3, a 200 Å n+-InP layer 
doped at n=1x1018 cm-3, a 100 Å  undoped 
In0.53Ga0.47As layer, a 1000 Å p+-In0.53Ga0.47As layer 
doped at p+=5x1018 cm-3, a 3000 Å n-InP layer doped 
at n=5x1017 cm-3 and, finally, a 1000 Å 
n+-In0.53Ga0.47As layer doped at n+=1.5x1019 cm-3. 
These layers were grown in that order on an InP 
substrate. 
These structures were fabricated into devices 
using optical lithography and selective wet etching 
for mesa definition. The mesa dimensions of emitter 
were 20x20 μm2. Straight HCl was adopted to etch 
the InP layer without the appreciable etching of 
InGaAs. Moreover, InGaAs was etched with 
solutions of H3PO4:H2O2:H2O (1:1:30 by volume). 
The etching solutions provide a high-selectivity 
etching between InP and InGaAs. A Keithley 4200 
semiconductor characterization system was applied 
to measure the dc parameters. A probe station with a 
temperature-controlled stage was employed to make 
temperature-dependent measurements.  
 
III. Device results and discussion 
Figures 1 and 2 plot current gain β  versus IC for 
the unpassivated CC-DHBT at VCB=0 and 1 V, 
respectively. Figure 2 reveals some unexpected 
behavior at high temperatures for moderate IC. At 
VCB=1, the curves are concave upward (V-shaped), 
but the curves from conventional HBTs in the 
literature are concave downward (reverse-U- or 
V-shaped). The anomalous behavior of β in Figs. 2 
indicates that something has happened in the B-C 
junction. The leakage current in this CC-DHBT 
principally flows from the undoped InGaAs and the 
highly doped InP layers between the p+-InGaAs base 
and the n--InP collector. With a narrow bandgap of 
0.75 eV [24], In0.53Ga0.47As has a low breakdown 
field and a high intrinsic carrier concentration. These 
data in Fig. 1 indicates that at high IC, the β of the 
unpassivated device declines slightly as temperature 
increases (<3% variation from 300 K to 400 K). The 
variation of β with temperature proposed herein is 
much smaller than what is typically seen in HBTs, 
revealing another advantage of the CC-DHBTs. The 
insensitivity of β to temperature follows from the 
large valence discontinuity between the InP emitter 
and that of the InGaAs base. Furthermore, a detailed
