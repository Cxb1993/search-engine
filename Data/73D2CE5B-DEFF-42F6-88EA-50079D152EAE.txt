continuously records the process and allows 
engineers to make process changes according 
to set parameters. Engineer use this chart to 
determine the reasons for process variations.  
The Shewhart control chart is designed 
for detecting large shifts in the process [1-5]. 
Because the Shewhart control chart uses only 
information about the process contained in the 
last plotted point, it ignores any information 
given by the entire sequence of points. 
Montgomery [6] pointed out that Shewhart 
control chart is applicable only to large shifts 
in the process. The Showhart chart is 
insensitive to small process shifts (1.5σ  or 
less） . Montgomery [6] pointed out that 
normal assumptions will not influence the 
process control when the average is abnormal. 
Therefore, Roberts [1] designed the 
exponentially weighted moving average 
(EWMA) control chart and Page [7] 
developed the cumulative sum（CUSUM）
control chart to deal with small process shifts. 
The EWMA and CUSUM control charts have 
nearly the same detection ability. The EWMA 
and CUSUM control charts are however, 
insensitive to large shifts in the process. 
Therefore, different charts must be used 
to detect different types of process shifts. This 
paper proposes a control chart based on the 
wavelet transformation for data decomposition 
and linear combination to emphasize 
abnormal process points. This method is able 
to quickly detect abnormal process shifts. This 
article discusses the mean shift using 
simulations and compares the proposed 
method with the ARL. Data from the article 
by Wasserman [8] is used as an example. And 
we prove the Wavelet control chart 
performance and compare it with method 
EWMA, CUSUM, and Q-charts.  
 
2 Methodology 
 
The current wavelet transformation 
research utilizes the wavelet to filter noise 
signals and get approximate (smooth) signals 
similar to the primitive signal. The difference 
in this research lies in utilizing wavelets to go 
to different resolution （ approximation ） 
signals and carry out linear combinations. 
Utilizing the time series concept that the 
predicts the error to deduct the original signal 
and linearly combine the resolution signals, 
the signal noise (abnormal) is isolated.  
This paper chose the Haar wavelet 
function as the basis. The Haar wavelet 
transformation is the basic wavelet 
transformation function [9, 10]. This function 
was developed using the box function. The 
Haar scale function definition is as follows:

Employing the scale function )(xφ , the 
Haar wavelet function can be written as： 
 )12()2()( −−= xxx φφψ                              
It shows the signal to analyze 
(multi-resolution) again to utilize the discrete 
wavelet transform and describes the regional 
time frequency characteristic. The Haar 
transformation operation movements can be 
regarded as and fetch the average difference in 
the sequence in discrete time function, 
average and difference of calculating that two 
adjoins in original data.  
This research adopted the practice of 
taking the group as the basis for the wavelet 
control chart. This procedure can be divided 
into two stages. The main purpose of stage 1 
is to collects the data.  The control limits are 
set in stage 2. Utilizing control limits from the 
first stage that stage carry on lasting control 
and revision in second stage. The following is 
the execution step that the wavelet control 
chart.

the information received may be 
insufficient. If 5>n then may cause

3 Simulation and analysis  
 
 This research adopted the stimulation 
method in the process verification. After 
estimating the wavelet resolutions, the linear 
combination parameters associated with that 
are compared with the EWMA control chart. 
Suppose 32 observed values are made 
independent each other. From the 23rd product 
mean shifts observed value by 0.1,0.2,0.3…,3 
standard deviation. The upward simulation 
shifts obey the normal distribution. In the 
normal state, assuming the mean 0=μ , and 
variable 12 =σ . The ARL is used to compare 
with the EWMA under different shifts to 
confirm that the wavelet control chart has 
better detection ability.  
 This length 5232 ==n  of sample of 
research can get 5 levels of resolution S1, S2, 
S3, S4, and S5 via the wavelet transformation.

Fig. 8.  The sub sample of every stage 
 
We can observe from Fig. 8 that find that 
the 23rd sample point when it is controlled to 
the 26th sample point is out of control on 
control chart. That is, the 10th that the wavelet 
control chart after abnormal happening can be 
detected. But while controlling to the 24th 
sample point, also find that the 23rd is close to 
control limit. 
Using Fig. 9 (a) and (b) prove that the 
wavelet control chart is the same time because 
of entering difference of the sample, so after 
multiple resolution analysis via the wavelet 
transform, lead to the fact that every sub 
observed value within the same time of 
sample appears with change. Figure 10 shows 
that it is in t=26 as the observed value and the 
23rd is out of control. The different place of 
tradition control charts, traditional EWMA 
control chart or CUSUM control chart 
comprehensive information produced of 
observed value of front of the present 
observed value. It is to synthesize the sample 
observed value information that preceding 
sample observed value information and 
follow-up enter that the wavelet control chart 
that this research. The dynamic EWMA 
control chart method is contrasted with 
Wasserman [10] just detects and measures the 
33rd point. The Q-chart cannot detect and 
measure the abnormal situation. Research this 
make with the same observed value CUSUM 
control chart in t=24 to find abnormal, and 
detecting the ability of examining and is close 
to with the wavelet control chart (Table 1). 
Therefore, the wavelet control chart has good 
detecting ability.

5 Conclusions  
 This research used the Shewhart control 
chart to structure wavelet and linear 
combination resolutions to identify quality 
characteristic data. Its purpose lies in 
emphasizing abnormal information points, 
making the traditional Shewhart control chart 
detect and examine weak variation changes in 
a process. Utilizing simulations, the wavelet 
and EWMA control charts were compared in 
identifying 0.3 standard deviation process 
shifts as follows: The EWMA and wavelet 
control charts were not good at detection. For 
0.4 standard deviation shifts, the wavelet 
control chart was superior to the EWMA 
control chart. In the verification of the practice 
in addition, adopt the Data in the article by 
Wasserman [10], and dynamic EWMA control 
chart, Q-chart, CUSUM control chart were 
adopted. The wavelet control chart was 
relatively good at detecting process shifts. The
