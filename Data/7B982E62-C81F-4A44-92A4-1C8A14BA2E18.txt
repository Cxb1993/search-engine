Introduction 
This general project contains three individual projects: 
1. functional and structural study of biological network via graph theory; 
2. structure prediction of RNA sequences; and 
3. biological sequences retrieval using Fourier-transform vectors. 
We achieved the following goals in each individual project: 
1. establish a computational model to express protein-protein interactions; devise analytical 
tools to extract structural conformations and physical-chemical properties on this model; 
develop a graph-based algorithm to identify the correlations between protein-protein 
interactions; implement the algorithm and apply it to real biological data; 
2. develop an algorithmic method to display the 3D models of RNA sequences from their 
secondary structures; conduct a series of demonstrations of this technique on real biological 
data; study related issues on improving the speed to render the models; 
3. build models to extract features from biological sequences based on Fourier transform; 
implement programs based on these models; compare and analyze the performance of this 
approach to other methods. 
 
There is a regular meeting to organize this research project at National Chi Nan University. 
The whole records can be found on the web site http://alg.csie.ncnu.edu.tw/seminar.php. In 
addition to these achievements, students engaged in this research project also gained enough 
training on design useful algorithms to solve biological problems. Their theses and 
implementations can be also found on the same web site. 
 
Methods and Results 
The first sub-project 
Protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) have complex topology. A complex network can be 
characterized by certain topological parameters. In the graph theory approach, a protein is 
represented as a node and an interaction as an edge.  Let G = (V, E) be a graph. By analyzing the 
DIP database1 one constructs the adjacency matrix, A to represent the protein-protein interaction

 And we designed a procedure to identify protein complexes as follows. 
1. Arrange the node connectivity of every node in descending order, that is S={kmax,….,1}. 
2. Search for a clique of order q. We consider a set of nodes with at least q-1 links, for instance, 
the set Sq={k, …q-1} consists of n nodes, where n≥q satisfies such a criterion. 
3. Among the Cnq possible combinations, we check whether the nodes are completely connected.  
If any two of the nodes is not directed link then we move to the next combination. Once a 
clique of order q is found, it is natural that it will contain cliques of order q-1, ….1. We use 
the clique polynomial to characterize the protein-protein interaction networks. The coefficient 
of ix  in the clique polynomial, C(G; x ), is the number of cliques of G with order i . 
The requirement of a clique corresponds to a protein complex may be too restrict. One could 
release this constraint by identifying pseudo-clique with protein complex. We will adopt the graph 
spectral method to identify cluster of proteins in the network. The clustering problem is equivalent 
to find the location of n vertices which minimizes the sum of distance squares between the points. 
It is evident that the number of proteins decrease with increasing number of connections, 
that is it has an inverse relation. In other words, protein has multiple connections are rare. We 
extend previous studies to a total of seven species. We present the regression and correlation 
analysis results for the node degree distribution and the network diameters data. Regression 
analysis determines that α lies between 1.48 and 2.34 for the seven species. Correlation analysis 
provides very good evidence (p-value<<10-6) supporting the fact that the seven PINs form a 
scale-free network. All the species have a r2 value larger than 0.90, and the closer r2 is to 1, the 
better it accounts for the correlation.

M. musculus 2.34±0.16 0.96 <<10-6 
S.cervisiae(CORE) 1.97±0.09 0.91 <<10-6 
To further characterize the network topological structures, we compute the Cave(k), and 
consider the logarithm of the Cave(k) vs. the logarithm of node degree k plots for the seven species.  
Next, we present the regression and correlation analysis results for the average clustering function 
Cave(k), the clustering coefficient C, and the C values for the species, C. elegans, D. melanogaster 
and S. cerevisiae.

for all i, j, and its effect is shown in the following figures. 
The next step is to map the fine-tuned points onto a cylinder. We apply a standard technique called 
S-mapping to perform this. 
We implement our method in C language. The testing real data come from the Nucleotide 
Acid Database and the Protein Data Bank. We set DB=17, DN=6, and DO=200, and the results for 
1EBR and 1A60 RNA sequences are as follows. 
The secondary structures for 1EBR and 1A60 are shown in the following figures:
