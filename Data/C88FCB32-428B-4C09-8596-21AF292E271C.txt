constant, phase-inverter structure, step-impedance 
technique and Chebyshev response to make the rat-race 
coupler more compact (~ 64% reduction) and highly 
balanced over a wide operating bandwidth. Moreover, 
the inter-digital coplanar stripline (CPS) used in 
the step-impedance section effectively reduces the 
characteristic impedance of the transmission line for 
large size shrinkage and reduction of insertion loss.
    In the second year, we propose a concept for the 
miniaturization of microwave components according to 
the theory of distortion-less transmission line.  By 
high silicon dielectric constant, lumped-distributed 
structure and band-broadening technique, a large 
shrinkage ratio with wide bandwidth of Chebyshev 
response can be simultaneously attained in the 
spiral-shape coplanar-stripline (CPS) phase-inverter 
rat-race coupler. The area of the demonstrated 
lumped-distributed phase-inverter rat-race coupler is 
0.65x0.65 mm2 and the experimental bandwidth is from 
2.5 to 12.5 GHz. As a result, a broadband Gilbert 
downconverter with the proposed coupler achieves a 
conversion gain of 11~12 dB, IP1dB of -11 dBm, IIP3 
of -1 dBm and noise figure of 16 dB. 
  Then, a 60-GHz dual-conversion down-converters with 
Schottky diodes are realized by using 0.18- m 
foundry CMOS technology. A new Schottky-diode mixer, 
down-conversion sub-harmonic mixer with a dual-band 
lump-distributed phase-inverter rat-race coupler 
(also directly on lossy silicon substrate), is 
realized and employed at the high-frequency 
conversion stage of the dual-conversion architecture 
to achieve small size and broadband isolation.  The 
dual-conversion down-converter achieves 5-dB 
conversion gain and 19 dB noise figure under Vdd=2.5 
V and Idd= 22 mA. 
  In the third year, a 60-GHz dual-conversion up-
converters with Schottky diodes are realized by using 
0.18-mm foundry CMOS technology. The silicon-based 
Schottky diode with a low turn-on voltage offers 
great advantage in LO pumping power, especially for 
an anti-parallel diode pair structure. and the dual-
conversion up-converter, with Vdd=2.5 V and Idd= 26

millimeter-wave circuits. Especially, the rat-race 
couplers can simultaneously provide balanced signals, 
all-port matching condition and good isolation. 
In a conventional rat-race coupler, the total electrical 
length of the circumference, consisting of one 3λ/4 and 
three λ/4 sections, is 1.5 λ and keeps balanced outputs 
only at a certain frequency [A7]. In order to reduce size, 
1.25 λ (7/6 λ) rat-race coupler [A8] with 1/8 λ (1/6 λ) 
sections was utilized to replace the conventional 1.5 λ 
rat-race coupler at the cost of bandwidth reduction. The 
formidable larger area makes the inclusion of a rat-race 
coupler in IC design unrealistic. By using lumped 
elements, the size of rat-race couplers can be effectively 
reduced [A9]. However, it is difficult to have 
high-quality, lumped inductors at high frequencies in 
silicon IC process. Many efforts have been devoted to 
design rat-race couplers with smaller size and wider 
bandwidth at the same time, such as the method of 
opposing short-circuit end [A10] and 
twisting-connection [A11]. These methods are proposed 
to replace the 3λ/4 section, which forms the embryo of 
a phase inverter. The phase is inherently inverted for all 
operating frequencies and the bandwidth of a 
phase-inverter, rat-race coupler is determined by the 
input return loss. Wang et al [A12] analyzed a 
phase-inverter rat-race coupler with an arbitrary output 
power-split ratio and band-broadening design under the 
lossless condition. A wider bandwidth can be achieved 
by selecting the impedance of each arm for a 
Chebyshev response by adjusting the characteristic 
impedance below [A13]. 
Because the standard CMOS process has no inherent 
backside ground for signal guiding, microstrip lines 
formed by interconnect metals are employed to 
implement λ/4-based hybrids [A14][A15]. The 
substrate loss is shielded by the ground plane formed 
by the metal-1 layer. E-band phase-inverter rat-race 
couplers are implemented by this technique, and the 
length of each arm at 77 GHz center frequency is up to 
320 μm [A15]. The hybrid size is large because the 
inter-metal dielectric has a low dielectric constant. 
Moreover, the microstrip line still suffers from some 
metal loss because the thin dielectric results in a narrow 
top metal. On the other hand, thin ground metal also 
results in poor ground quality. Recently, the 
phase-inverter rat-race coupler on a lossy silicon 
substrate was first demonstrated by our group to reduce 
the size by high effective dielectric constant at the cost 
of insertion loss [A16]. The phase-inverter, rat-race 
coupler in our previous work [A16] was only utilized at 
the LO port of a Gilbert mixer instead of the RF signal 
path for broadband operation. Because the noise figure 
in the RF signal path is sensitive to loss, a 
step-impedance phase-inverter rat race coupler with 
less insertion loss prevails. 
In this work, a low-loss, phase-inverter, rat-race 
coupler employed at the RF signal path uses 
step-impedance technique to mitigate its impact on the 
noise figure of a receiver [A17]. The proposed concept 
utilizes high dielectric constant of silicon, phase 
inverter, step-impedance structure and Chebyshev 
response to achieve compact, wide bandwidth and low 
loss at the same time for an integrated rat-race coupler. 
The arm lengths of 10-GHz, step-impedance, 
phase-inverter, rat-race couplers in this work have large 
size reduction and only need a nearly half of the 
equivalent length if compared with a 10-GHz 
microstrip line using inter-connect metal as ground. We 
also implement a Gilbert down-converter incorporating 
the proposed rat-race coupler at the RF input in 
0.13-μm standard CMOS process. From the measured 
results, the size-reduction rat-race coupler with lower 
loss successfully converts the input signal into Gilbert 
mixer core without serious noise figure degradation.

Here R, L, G, and C are the unit-length resistance, 
inductance, conductance and capacitance of the TL. It 
is interesting to note that the imaginary part becomes 
zero if the TL is designed under three special cases. As 
shown in Fig. 2(b), these special cases are indicated by 
line-A, -B and –C. The conditions for a pure real 
characteristic impedance in Fig. 2(b) are listed as 
follows, 
1. 0R G  , the lossless condition is along line-A. 
The characteristic impedance is always a real number 
unless the degree (θ) of matching point exceeds 45° 
[A12]. 
2. R G
L C
 , the distortionless TL is along line-B. Under 
this condition, the attenuation constant is equal for all 
frequencies and the phase constant is also a linear 
function of operating frequency. There exists an 
inherently-perfect matching point in the return-loss 
response, which is the well-known Butterworth 
matching condition. 
3. ,  R G  , the region is located at the line C 
and behind line C (   ). However, the high metal 
loss ( R    ) and substrate loss (G   ) make the 
insertion loss of a rat-race coupler too large to be 
utilized.  
Strictly speaking, Chebyshev response under lossy 
condition cannot be achieved with a real characteristic 
impedance. However, there exists a quasi-real 
characteristic impedance region defined by the ratio of 
|Zim|/|Z|, as depicted in Fig. 3. A Chebyshev response 
can be designed inside the shade region because of the 
small imaginary impedance (|Zim|/|Z|<0.1).

B. Multi-Finger CPS for Large Size Reduction on 
a Silicon-Based Process 
A step-impedance technique is utilized in this paper to 
reduce the length of a phase-inverter rat-race coupler 
and loss can be reduced due to shorter transmission line. 
Here, a high impedance ratio in a step-impedance 
structure facilitates the size reduction. For 0.13 μm 
standard CMOS process, the realizable microstrip line 
impedance formed by interconnect metals ranges from 
28 Ω to 77 Ω. The small impedance ratio (~2.75) is a 
disadvantage for the step-impedance design. In this 
work, a coplanar stripline directly on silicon substrate is 
adopted for size reduction because a higher effective 
dielectric constant results in a shorter effective 
wavelength. The achievable impedance level is 
controlled by adjusting the width and spacing of the 
coplanar stripline because most EM-field is well 
confined between the adjacent metals. According to 
0.13 μm CMOS design rule, the thickness, minimum 
spacing and maximum width of metal-8 are 3.3 μm, 2

IC. As shown in Fig. 5, a lossy quarter-wavelength 
transmission line is replaced by a low-high-low 
step-impedance structure, and the corresponding ABCD 
matrix for the lossy condition is expressed as (4). Here,   
H is the propagation constant and 2 H  is the length 
of the high impedance ( Hz ) section while L  is the 
propagation constant and L  is the length of the low 
impedance ( Lz ) section. The equivalent ABCD matrix 
of the imitated lossy λ/4 transmission line at the center 
frequency can be simplified as (6). Here,   is the 
propagation constant and   is the length of the 
imitated lossy λ/4 transmission line section. Thus, the 
elements of A or D expressed in (6) are equivalent to 
sinh( )
4
j    for the lossy condition. For replacing the 
quarter-wavelength section by a step impedance section, 
the ABCD of low-high-low step-impedance section in 
(5) is equivalent to that of a lossy λ/4 transmission line 
section in (6). Based on the derivation in Appendix C, 
θL is a function of θH as described in (C.3). The 
degrees of θH+θL with respect to θH for different 
impedance ratios ( /H LR z z   ) are plotted in Fig. 6(a), 
for the lossless ( 0H L      ) [A19] and lossy 
( 0H L     ) conditions.  When the impedance 
ratio of increases, θH+θL becomes smaller. The 
minimum length for different impedance ratios (R) are 
along the curve-1 in Fig. 6(a) and always occur under 
θH=θL [A19]. If compared with the minimum ratio of 
R=1.5, the degree of θH+θL at R=8 is greatly reduced 
from 43.8° to 26°, and the total size reduction is about 
65 %. However, the shrinkage ratio decreases slightly 
under lossy conditions. When the loss increases, the 
total degree of θH+θL becomes larger. 
The impedance ratio of R for the step-impedance 
technique inherently has a maximum value due to the 
limitation of the realizable impedance ( ( )H MAXz and 
( )L MINz ). /Hz z  and / Lz z   as a function of θH can be 
derived from the elements B and C of ABCD matrix in 
(5b) and (5c), respectively. /Hz z   and / Lz z  against 
θH for various impedance ratio of R are plotted in Fig. 
6(b) and 6(c) from (7a) and (7b), respectively.

Equations (7a) and (7b) include the information 
about the practical impedance selection criterion for 
Hz  and Lz . Because the goal is to shrink the passive 
circuit size by the step impedance technique, the 
minimum θH+θL  points of a~f in Fig. 6(a) are mapped 
to these of a’~f and a”~f’  along Curve-2 and Curve-3 
in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(c), respectively. Thus, the 
practical required /Hz z   and  / Lz z  can be 
determined. Because the points of a~f  in Fig. 6(a) are 
all located at the minimum points (θH=θL),  θH for 
the points of  a’~f and  a”~f” are equal to 13°, 15° , 
17°,  19°, 21° and 22° while R= 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1.5.  
 The maximum impedance ratio of R is limited by 
z , ( )H MAXz and ( )L MINz . The bandwidth of the input 
return loss is determined by z of the imitated λ/4 
transmission line while ( )H MAXz and ( )L MINz depend on the 
process. It will be discussed later that a wider 
bandwidth is realized by choosing a lower impedance 
of z for each arm of the imitated phase-inverter 
rat-race coupler as shown in Fig. 7(a). There exists a 
minimum for z  in consideration of the magnitude of 
the return loss at the center frequency of f/fC=1. Thus, 
z  is decided first in the design. The impedance ratio  
higher value; thus, a higher impedance ratio of ( )R  
becomes allowable. For instance, when z  is reduced 
from 2 (70.7 Ω ) to 1.08 (54 Ω ), the highest 
( ) /H MAXz z  increases to 2.17 and R=8 (at the point of a′) 
can be realized. Thus, the minimum θH+θL of 26° 
becomes possible. Thus, each arm is further reduced to 
58 % of the original λ/4 length. According to Fig. 
6(c), / Lz z   is equal to 3.68, which is smaller than the 
maximum realizable ratio of ( )/ L MINz z   (= 54 Ω/ 10 Ω). 
Because the low-impedance boundary is effectively 
extended by the inter-digital structure, the impedance 
constraint in silicon process is limited by ( )H MAXz  instead 
of by ( )L MINz . The return loss of the step-impedance 
technique for the cases of a’~ c’ are plotted in Fig. 7(b). 
It is clearly revealed that demarcation between 
Butterworth and Chebyshev matching response for the 
case ( ( ) 2.3H H MAXz z   ) is located around / 1.6Hz z    . 
The input return loss at the points of a′~b′  is 
characterized as a Chebyshev response while the input 
return loss for c′ ~f ′  corresponds to a one-dip 
matching at the center frequency. The curves for a lossy 
condition ( 2 /Np cm  ) are also plotted in Fig. 7(a) 
and 7(b). As marked by the dashed lines, the bandwidth 
is slightly extended when the return loss dips are 
gradually smeared out as loss increases especially at the 
high frequency dip. 
It is interesting to notice that a bandwidth extension 
technique with Chebyshev response also exists for the 
design of a step-impedance, phase-inverter, rat-race 
coupler as illustrated by Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b). This 
property implies that a wide bandwidth, small size and 
thus less loss step-impedance phase-inverter rat-race 
coupler can be achieved at the same time in our work. 
Based on the discussion above, the design flow of a 
step-impedance phase-inverter rat-race coupler is 
summarized as follows, 
1)  Achieve the wanted bandwidth of the input 
return loss for an imitated, phase-inverter, rat-race 
coupler by choosing the characteristic impedance of 
each arm according to Fig. 7(a).  For example, 100 % 
bandwidth ratio with an acceptable (for example, 12 dB) 
return loss is realized under ( /4) 54 Z    . 
2) The realizable ( )H MAXz  and ( )L MINz , limited by the 
silicon process, need to be considered to determine the 
maximum impedance ratio of R for the step-impedance 
technique according to constraints in Fig. 6(b)-6(c). In 
general, ( )H MAXz  sets the limit for the maximum 
impedance ratio of R because of the extension of the 
low impedance boundary by the inter-digital structure. 
Thus, only Fig. 6(b) is used to determine the maximum 
impedance ratio of R and Hz  is set to be ( )H MAXz .  
3)  The length (or degree) of high and low 
impedance lines can be obtained from curve 1 of Fig. 
6(a) to achieve the minimum size.  
4) From Section II-B, the design parameters, such as 
spacing and finger number, for a high-impedance CPS 
and an inter-digital CPS can be quickly determined. 
5) By the electromagnetic simulation, the return-loss 
bandwidth, amplitude/phase balance, center frequency 
and size can be accurately verified after several 
iterations.

Broadband CMOS Gilbert Down-Converter 
  Figure 10(a) shows a practical application of the 
step-impedance phase-inverter rat-race coupler in the 
broadband Gilbert down-converter using 0.13 μm 
standard CMOS technology. A 15 GHz miniature 
rat-race coupler is employed in the RF stage to generate 
the wideband differential signal, and it is followed by 
the common-gate-configured transistors, M1~M2, 
which have superior frequency response and low input 
impedance to facilitate broad-band impedance matching. 
The device size of the transistors, M1 and M2, is 
ten-finger with a unit gate-width of 2.5 μm. The input 
impedance of the common-gate stage is equal to the 
reciprocal of the transconductance. By adjusting the DC 
biasing, a desired input impedance ( Zin ) can be 
obtained. The input impedance, Zin, is approximately 
50 Ω under the gate voltage of 0.6 V. The Gilbert mixer 
core (M3~M6), driven by differential LO signal, 
commutates RF currents for frequency translation. The 
differential IF current output is combined by the active 
PMOS current mirror (M7 and M8) to generate a 
single-ended output. A common collector stage 
consisting of transistors M9–M10 is employed as the IF 
output buffer to drive the 50 Ω impedance of the 
measurement equipment. 
  When compared with a traditional rat-race coupler 
[A7], the proposed rat-race coupler can provide dc 
return paths from port-2/port-4 (RF+/RF-) to ground by 
the phase-inverter structure. Thus, a wideband 
differential signal is generated for the double-balanced 
Gilbert mixer core without voltage headroom and dc 
power consumption. On the other hand, a rat-race 
coupler has a better ability to alleviate the unbalanced 
effect caused by the output impedance mismatch when 
compared with a Marchand balun. As depicted in Fig. 
10(b), ΔZ represents the amount of the impedance 
mismatch at the output ports of the Marchand balun and 
 
Fig. 11. Chip micrograph of the CMOS Gilbert down converter using 
a 15 GHz step-impedance phase-inverter rat-race coupler as the 
RF-port single-to-differential balun. The chip size is 1.4 × 1.8 mm2. 
   In the step-impedance section, the high impedance 
( ZHigh ) and low impedance ( ZLow ) are near 113 Ω and 
18 Ω, respectively. Thus, the impedance ratio of R is 
about 6.6 and the impedance of the imitated λ/4 section 
is equal to 55 Ω. The length of each arm of the 15 GHz 
rat-race coupler is shrunk to 630 μm. From the 
simulated results, the insertion loss is 4~5 dB with the 
amplitude and phase errors of 1 dB and 2°, respectively. 
When compared with the stand-alone 10 GHz 
phase-inverter rat-race coupler in Fig. 8, the loss is 
further reduced due to a smaller size at higher 
frequency. As shown in Fig. 11, the March Balun is at 
the left side of the photograph and the miniature 
rat-race coupler is on the right side. The total size is 1.4 
× 1.8 mm2.  
   Figure 12 shows the conversion gain, input 1-dB 
gain compression point (IP1dB) and input third-order 
inter-modulation point (IIP3) versus RF frequency 
under fIF=100 MHz. The conversion gain is above 8 dB 
from 7 GHz to 18 GHz while the IP1dB and IIP3 
within operating bandwidth are better than -12.5 dBm 
and -2 dBm, respectively. The power performance at 
the operating frequency of 12 GHz is shown in Figure 
13. Because all of the transistors in the Gilbert-cell 
mixer are implemented in the deep N-well, the signal 
leakage through substrate is less likely. Most of leakage 
is caused by the circuit topology; thus, a high symmetry 
is important for the leakage cancellation between LO 
and RF ports. LO-to-RF isolation is better than 35 dB 
and RF-to-IF isolation is around 20 dB over the 
operating frequency range.  
 Figure 14 shows the measured conversion gain versus 
LO power with a RF input power of -30 dBm under fRF 
of 12 GHz and fIF of 100 MHz. When LO power 
exceeds -5 dBm, the curve is gradually saturated and 
enters the flat region of conversion gain versus LO 
power, where conversion gain and noise figure are 
insensitive to LO power. In the flat conversion gain 
region, the Gilbert mixing core has a higher tolerance 
for the LO signal mismatch. Figure 15 shows the 
measured conversion gain and double sideband (DSB) 
noise figure versus IF frequency of 10 MHz ~ 1 GHz 
under fRF=9.1 GHz. The noise figure of 16 dB indicates 
that the step-impedance rat-race coupler in the first 
stage successfully converts the received power to the 
common-gate input, and suffers less from substrate loss. 
A better noise figure is expected by further increasing 
the impedance ratio of R because of the higher size 
reduction. The mixer core consumes 2.9 mA at the 
supply voltage of 1.8 V. The simulated results are all 
shown in Fig. 12~15 for comparisons. 
 
2nd year 
  A 60 GHz millimeter-wave system with unlicensed 
7-GHz bandwidth conspicuously stands out in 
short-range high-data-rate applications, such as wireless 
personal area network (WPAN) and high-definition 
multimedia interface (HDMI). In 2004, the first CMOS 
60-GHz amplifier was successfully demonstrated in 
standard 0.13- 　 m CMOS technology, beginning 
60-GHz transmission using the CMOS-based IC [B1]. 
Subsequently, different architectures for receivers, 
transmitters and transceivers [B2]-[B13] were proposed 
and came into fruition by using standard advanced 
130-nm CMOS, 90-nm CMOS and SiGe HBT 
processes. The reported noise figure (NF) of a 130-nm 
CMOS receiver [B3] is up to 12.5 dB while 90-nm 
CMOS receivers [B5]-[B13] achieve a better NF of 
5.5~8 dB. Recently, 65-nm [B14][B15] or 45-nm [B16] 
CMOS technologies have also been devoted in the 
60-GHz transmission. To date, the noise figures of the 
65-nm and 45-nm CMOS receivers are 5.5~7 dB and 
6~8 dB, respectively. Even with more advanced CMOS 
technologies, NF improvement is limited. Additionally, 
a power amplifier (PA) is also a key component at such 
high 60-GHz path loss because the output power of 
PAs determines the maximum transmission distance. 
The low breakdown voltage in the advanced CMOS 
process makes high-power designs difficult. Compared 
with III-V compound technologies, standard CMOS 
PAs have lower power added efficiency (PAE) 
[B4],[B5],B[10],[B12],[B13], thus requiring larger DC 
power consumption for the same output power. The DC 
power consumption becomes more severe at 60-GHz 
system because many PAs are required for multiple 
paths in the transmitter, especially for beam-forming  
constant, the phase constant 　 is a linear function of 
frequency and the characteristic impedance is 
independent of frequency. Thus, for the case of a 
distortionless transmission line, the size shrinkage 
concept by the effective dielectric constant is preserved 
by observing (B.2) and (B.3) while the attenuation 
constant coexists. In other words, the design 
methodology of the size shrinkage for the lossless 
condition is still applicable as if the loss does not exist. 
There is no constraint on the loss for the distortionless 
transmission line and one distinct concept for the 
distortionless transmission line is the coexistence of 
size shrinkage and loss. A quality factor for the 
distortionless transmission line can be defined as 
follows [22] to discuss the loss effect.

It turns out that the quality factor is only 2.1 for the 
distortionless transmission line example in reference 
[B21] when the center frequency is 15 GHz. 
Here, a simple parallel plate transmission line is 
employed as a heuristic example to establish the 
distortionless condition (R/L=G/C). As shown in Fig. 2, 
parallel plates with metal width W and thickness t are 
separated by a distance of d. Finite metal thickness t 
accounts for the metal loss and silicon with finite 
dielectric loss is inserted between two parallel plates.

Here, ε, μ, σc and   are the dielectric constant,

of two in (B.6) accounts for the metal loss from both 
top and bottom plates. The distortionless condition 
(R/L=G/C) can be fulfilled by the following equation.

By plugging in the silicon relative dielectric constant of 
11.8 and metal conductivity of 2.0x107 S/m into (B.8), 
a heuristic design formula is established as follows, 
20.81    m                                         (B.9)t d    
The derivation above assumes that the current conducts 
uniformly in the finite thickness t. This assumption 
holds true if the metal thickness t is less than the skin 
depth. Otherwise, the metal thickness is replaced by the 
skin depth for a very thick metal and the skin effect 
complicates the distortionless condition because the 
metal resistance R is a function of frequency. Then, a 
distortionless condition can only be designed at the 
center frequency and the dispersive transmission line 
puts an additional constraint on the bandwidth of a rat 
race coupler. The metal thickness in IC fabrication is 
about the same order of magnitude of the skin depth. 
The skin depth at 10 GHz is 0.65 　m. Thus, a metal 
thickness of 0.5 　 m has a uniform current 
approximately and d is 1.62 　m from (B.9). The 
resulting separation distance d is a reasonable number 
for passive coupler design in the IC fabrication process. 
In summary, the distortionless condition is established 
by introducing a finite thickness t for the metal. The 
design methodology for the characteristic impedance is 
only affected by the width W and distance d parameters 
as the case of a lossless transmission line. Thus, a 
distortionless condition and matching condition for a 
phase-inverter rat-race coupler can be achieved 
simultaneously. In our work, a coplanar stripline is 
employed and more involved analysis is needed for the 
distortionless condition. This is beyond the scope of our 
work.

finally determined by the lumped-distributed 
phase-inverter rat-race coupler (used in LO port). 
  The proposed rat-race coupler is employed at the LO 
port of the UWB Gilbert micro-mixer and the area 
excluding pads is 0.9x0.8 mm2 as shown in Fig. 5. The 
current consumption of the mixer core is 4.1 mA at 5-V 
supply voltage. Figure 6 shows the measured 
conversion gain (CG), P1dB, IIP3 and noise figure with 
respect to the RF frequency. The CG keeps 11~ 12 dB 
within 1-dB variation and the noise figure is 15~17 dB 
from 3 to 11 GHz. IP1dB and IIP3 keep around -12~-10 
dBm and -1 dBm for each UWB band group, and the 
measured IF 3-dB bandwidth is up to 1.0 GHz. The 
measured LO-to-RF/ LO-to-IF/RF-to-IF isolation is 
better than 40 dB/35 dB/20 dB.  
(C) The demonstrated 60-GHz dual-conversion 
down-converter in 0.18 μm foundry CMOS

  The 60 GHz dual-conversion down-converter 
demonstrated in this research is composed of an SHM 
driven by the LO1 signal (first LO), the first 
intermediate-frequency (IF1) amplifier, a resistive 
mixer driven by the LO2 signal (second LO), a 
wideband amplifier (IF2), and a quadrature generator 
(LO2) as shown in Fig. 7 (a). The frequency planning 
of the dual-conversion is illustrated in Fig. 7(b).  It is 
easy to fix the LO2 frequency at the most accurate 
point of the IQ generator to obtain a precise baseband 
IQ output while the designated RF channel is selected  
by tuning the LO1 frequency. Here, the 2fLO1 signal is 
tuned between 47~56 GHz and the LO2 signal is fixed

at 10 GHz. In the high-frequency conversion, the 
silicon Schottky-diode SHM with low turn-on voltage 
facilitates the LO1 buffer amplifier design. 
   The first stage in the dual conversion is a 60-GHz 
SHM, which includes a dual-band phase-inverter 
rat-race coupler and two Schottky-diode mixer cells in 
APDP configuration, as shown in Fig. 8. The coupler 
merges an RF divider and an LO1 balun into one 
passive component to reduce the area necessary for 
SHM. An in-phase/out-of-phase signal is generated 
from the RF/LO port while the two APDPs are 
series-connected between the remaining two ports as 
shown in Fig. 7(a). The in-phase/out-of-phase signal is 
always maintained for all frequencies because the 
physical paths from the RF/LO ports to the other two 
outputs are equal in geometry for the phase-inverter 
rat-race coupler. The output IF signal is taken from the 
virtual ground of the LO1 signals, formed at the middle 
point of two series connected APDPs, to achieve a good 
broadband LO-to-IF isolation. There are good 
broadband isolations between the RF and LO ports due 
to the intrinsic isolation property of the wideband 
four-port coupler. The APDP structure inherently

junction capacitance from the APDP, contributing to 
the size reduction, is not negligible, the shunting 
capacitance (CP1) at both RF and LO ports needs to be 
larger than that (CP2) of the other two ports. Finally, 
the phase-inverter rat-race coupler can be further 
compacted to a square with sides of 400 μm in length 
by winding the arms, and the practical size of a 
stand-alone SHM is only 0.16 mm2 as shown in Fig. 9. 
 
Fig. 9. Die photograph of the 60 GHz dual-conversion 
down-converter using 0.18-μm CMOS technology. 
   After the first conversion, the noise figure caused 
by the second conversion must be low enough to 
achieve an acceptable noise figure for the 60 GHz 
dual-conversion down-converter. Our goal is to have 
the overall noise figure of dual conversion below 20 dB 
based on the gain and noise figure of GaAs-based 
LNAs at 60 GHz. The first stage Schottky-diode SHM 
has a conversion loss of 15 dB. It means that the noise 
figure of the subsequent stage, including the 
intermediate-frequency (IF1) amplifier, the second 
stage resistive mixer and the wideband output buffer, 
must be lower than 5 dB at  fIF1=10 GHz. A topology 
with low noise figure and high gain, as shown in Fig. 
7(a), is chosen for the IF1 amplifier. The IF1 amplifier 
consists of a common source stage with the source 
degeneration inductor of LS for simultaneous noise and 
gain match and a subsequent cascode stage for gain 
boosting. Here, the gain of the IF1amplifier is designed 
to be around18~20 dB to suppress the noise caused by 
the resistive mixer. The bandpass response of the input 
matching network of the IF1 amplifier suppresses the 
fLO1 leakage signal. A 25-dB reduction in the LO1 
leakage signal is obtained in simulation. At the output 
load of the IF1 amplifier, a single-to-differential 
transformer is employed for ac coupling, dc blocking, 
balanced-signal generation, and impedance 
transformation. The primary-coil inductance combined 
with the parasitic capacitance of the cascode device, 
M3, forms an LC tank at fIF1, and the secondary-coil 
inductance resonates out the parasitic capacitance at the 
source of the resistive mixer. The transformer is 
designed with a turn ratio of two (N=2) to transfer the 
high output impedance (Zout) of the cascode stage to 
the low input impedance (Zmixer) of the 
double-balanced resistive mixer. The transformer has a 
coupling factor of 0.7 while the primary and secondary 
inductances are 1.62 nH and 0.62 nH, respectively. The 
peak of quality factor is designed as closely as possible 
to fIF1. The maximum quality factor of the primary coil 
is 7.8 at fQmax of 8.5 GHz while the quality factor at 
10 GHz is 7.5. The maximum quality factor of the 
secondary coil is 6.9 at fQmax of 10.3 GHz. For 
generating IQ baseband signals at low-frequency 
conversion stage, a two-stage polyphase shifter is 
employed at the LO2 ports of the 10-GHz 
double-balanced resistive mixers.

COMPARISON OF MICROWAVE/MILLIMETER-WAVE SUB-HARMONICALLY PUMPED DIODE MIXERS 
 
3rd year 
   As the speed of CMOS technologies improves by 
the scaling rule, an SOC solution with RF front-end and 
baseband circuits becomes feasible for the low 
frequency band. Recently, commercial 5-GHz WLAN 
transceivers excluding power amplifiers have been 
realized by advanced CMOS and SiGe BiCMOS 
technologies. Highly-integrated CMOS transceivers 
with digital ICs are easily attained, but it is difficult to 
merge high-power PAs with good linearity into RF 
transceivers due to the low breakdown voltage and high 
silicon-substrate coupling. To date, a stand-alone 
high-power PA has a unique market in 2.4 GHz or 
5-GHz WLAN applications. Although CMOS PAs and 
SiGe PAs have been demonstrated for 2.4 GHz WLAN 
applications, III-V compound technology is still a good 
candidate for high power design with excellent linearity 
and efficiency. 
   Up to millimeter-wave regime, is a fully 
CMOS-based design the best solution for 60-GHz 
transceivers? 
   In the millimeter-wave regime, HEMT-based LNAs  
and PAs have superior noise figure at low DC power 
and larger output power with higher power added 
efficiency, respectively. The unmatched performances 
offered by HEMT-based LNA and PA at 60 GHz are 
still very attractive for millimeter-wave applications. 
Before introducing the architecture of our work, the 
performances of 60-GHz LNAs and PAs implemented 
in different technologies are studied. Figure 1 shows the 
comparison of stand-alone 60-GHz LNAs using 
130-nm, 90-nm, 65-nm CMOS and III-V compound 
technologies. The noise figure of 60-GHz CMOS-based 
LNAs slightly improves as the scaling rule, but the 
III-V compound LNAs with the smaller than 3-dB 
noise figure obviously prevail. This is because III-V 
   Here, we briefly review the history of the Schottky 
diode realized in the foundry CMOS process. The 
Schottky diode, a majority-carrier device, has no 
minority storage effect and thus possesses very 
high-speed response for mixing and rectification. 
Among the GaAs-based technologies, Schottky-diode 
mixers have matured [C23]. However, little attention 
has been paid to the silicon processes because of the 
absence of Schottky diodes in a standard CMOS 
process. A 12-GHz down-converter using silicon 
Schottky diodes was demonstrated using bipolar 
technology with an extra processing step for Schottky 
diodes [C24]. In 1996, the first experimental work to 
form Schottky diodes without an extra processing step 
in a foundry CMOS process was demonstrated by 
arranging the layout layers appropriately [C25]. 
However, the initial rectifying effect of the Schottky 
diodes was limited to 600 MHz, possibly due to the 
long wire bonding used in the measurement set-up. 
Until 2005, Schottky diodes with a cut-off frequency 
beyond  
 
Fig. 3. Block diagram of the demonstrated dual-conversion up-/down- converters using Schottky diodes in 0.18-μm standard CMOS technology 
for a 60 GHz transmission system. 
 
several hundred GHz were developed in standard 
CMOS [C26]. The Schottky diodes based on the 
standard silicon process offer superior frequency 
conversion and thus key components such as signal 
detectors [C27][C30], frequency doublers [C29], and 
mixers [C28] have been implemented in the 
millimeter-wave regime. These results [C27][C29][C30] 
shed light on the suitability of Schottky diodes in 
millimeter-wave applications using foundry CMOS 
process. The Schottky diode, like a catalyst, 
significantly reduces the R&D cost barriers and makes 
a 60-GHz transceiver with low-cost CMOS technology 
possible. However, no millimeter-wave transceiver 
based on the Schottky diodes has been reported to date. 
  A direct conversion requires accurate quadrature LO 
signal generation directly at the same frequency of RF 
signals. Fully integrated transceivers, based on the 
direct conversion architecture, have been successfully 
demonstrated below 5 GHz because IQ signal 
generation is less sensitive to the parasitic effects of the 
practical layout. When the channel bandwidth 
approaches several GHz at the millimeter-wave 
frequency, it becomes difficult to generate a precise, 
wideband IQ signal at 60 GHz. Thus, as discussed later  
 
in this report, a dual-conversion architecture is 
employed to accomplish the band selection and 
quadrature generation in two separate steps. As shown 
in Fig. 3, the block diagrams for the 60-GHz 
dual-conversion up-/down-converters are depicted 
inside the dashed-square area. A precise IQ signal is 
generated by a fixed quadrature LO2 at low-frequency 
conversion while channel selection is achieved by 
sweeping LO1 at high-frequency conversion. Here, the 
dual conversion consists of a high-frequency 
conversion using the microwave/millimeter-wave 
design approach and a low-frequency conversion using 
the analog design approach. For the higher-frequency 
conversion, a dual-band lump-distributed 
phase-inverter rat-race coupler and a compact trifilar 
transformer together with anti-parallel diode pairs 
(APDPs) are proposed for Schottky-diode 
sub-harmonic down-conversion and up-conversion 
mixers (SHMs), respectively. The SHMs reduce the LO 
frequency to one-half of a fundamental mixer, and thus 
alleviate the difficulty of millimeter-wave LO 
generation with 0.18-m CMOS technology. The 
proposed SHM topologies provide inherent cancellation 
among all ports of SHMs to achieve broadband 
up-conversion mixer pumped by LO2 signal at 
low-frequency conversion and an IF1 differential 
driving amplifier inserted between the two-step 
up-conversion stages. Details of the schematics are 
presented below. 
(A) 60 GHz Sub-Harmonic Schottky-Diode Mixer 
Using Trifilar Transformer 
   The 60 GHz SHM includes a trifilar transformer for 
differential IF1 and LO1 inputs, series-connected 
Schottky-diode APDPs in double-balanced 
configuration for sub-harmonic mixing, and a 
Marchand Balun for 60-GHz differential RF signal 
extraction. A trifilar transformer with one primary coil 
and two secondary coils is a useful microwave passive 
circuit [C31] and has been employed in image-reject 
down-converters [C32] and quadrature 
voltage-controlled oscillators [C33]. Here, we use a 
trifilar transformer with

sub-harmonically pumped mixer of the 60-GHz dual-conversion 
up-converter. 
 
2:1:1 turn ratios to implement an SHM in 
millimeter-wave frequency. The schematic and physical 
layout are illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The IF1 signal is fed 
via the center-taps of two secondary coils while the LO1  
signal is coupled by the magnetic flux from the primary 
coil to two secondary coils. Due to the port 
arrangements, the mutual isolations between the LO 
and IF ports are achieved by the trifilar. As show in Fig. 
4(a), two series-connected APDPs are placed at the 
remaining ports of a trifilar transformer such that the 
middle point of each series-connected APDPs is a 
virtual ground for the differential LO1 signal. Thus, an 
inherently good LO1-to-RF isolation can be attained 
because differential RF signals are taken from the 
virtual-ground points. At the same time, 2LO1-to-RF 
isolations are achieved due to the APDP configuration. 
In order to drive the external single-ended amplifier, a 
March balun is used for the differential-to-single 
conversion.  The Marchand balun adopts slotted 
shielding to block the lossy silicon substrate for loss 
reduction and to reduce the speed of the propagating 
wave for size reduction. Because there is a wide 
separation in frequency between IF and RF signals, the 
IF-to-RF isolation can be achieved by the bandpass 
response of the Marchand balun.

using 0.18-μm CMOS technology. 
 
There is a trade-off in the coupling design for the IF1 
and LO1 inputs to the ports connected to the APDPs 
because the trifilar transformer deals with two signals 
with different frequencies at the same time. All the 
terminals are labeled as shown in Fig. 5(a). If the 
coupling between the LO1 ports (terminals of 1 and 2) 
to the ports connected to the APDP (terminals of 5, 6, 7 
and 8) is too high, the signal transmitted between LO1 
ports to the ports connected to the APDP increases; thus, 
the required LO1 power is lowered at the cost of low 
transmission between IF (terminals of 3 and 4) to the 
port connected by the APDP (terminals of 5, 6, 7 and 8). 
Figures 5 (b) and 5 (c) show the LO1-to-RF and 
IF1-to-RF insertion loss versus operating frequency by 
EM-simulations. A trade-off between the LO1 pumping

constant. The best performance is nearly 44 dB 
rejection at fRF(out)=57 GHz, meaning that the LO2 
quadrature signal keeps the amplitude and phase errors 
smaller that 0.2 dB and 1 ﾟ, respectively. Moreover, the 
2fLO1+fLO2 (10-GHz LO2 signal leaked to the RF interest 
band) suppression, referring to desired output power, is 
about 22~23 dBc. The measured suppression and 
isolations across the entire 60 GHz bandwidth are 
shown in Fig. 11. Here, LO1-to-RF isolation is about 
30~40 dB, and 2LO1-to-RF isolation is better than 65 
dB thanks to the fully-symmetrical design of the 
double-balanced SHM by using the trifilar transformer 
and the APDPs structure. 
   The performances of the 60-GHz up-converter and 
other state-of-the art up-converters at millimeter-wave 
frequency are summarized in Table II. Our proposed 
dual-conversion up-converter has the highest SBR over 
the 60 GHz bandwidth of any circuit on the list.  
 
advanced passive circuits, such as the proposed 
phase-inverter rat-race coupler and trifilar transformer, 
are available, the Schottky-diode millimeter-wave 
mixers using low-cost foundry CMOS process becomes 
practical. The demonstrated 60-GHz dual-conversion 
down-converter (in the second year), operating from 
57~66 GHz, has conversion gain of 5 dB, IP1dB of -5 
dBm and IIP3 of 5 dBm. The corresponding 
Schottky-diode SHM requires only the small LO power 
of 1 dBm. For the 60-GHz dual-conversion 
up-converter (in the third year), conversion gain of -2 
dB, OP1dB of -17 dBm, and broadband sideband 
rejection better than 40-dB are achieved. Based on the 
results of this work, incorporating the demonstrated 
0.18- 　 m CMOS dual-conversion up-/down- 
converters with high-performance HEMT-based LNA 
and PA gives an alternative attractive solution for 
60-GHz transmission.

一、參加會議經過 
 
    本次的 2011 年 APMC 會議在澳大利亞墨爾本舉行。會期自 2011 年 12 月 5 日至 8
日。此會議主題囊括了各式微波、毫米波技術，因此，此會議包含各種微波及毫米
波電路之應用，如前端天線、濾波器及後端主動晶片等內容。上圖為本人參加會議
於會議入口。 
    近年來美國地區逐漸退出微波這塊學術領域，微波這塊領域已由亞洲人作為主
導，本次的亞太微波來參加的學者更是相當踴躍，本人有幸於此發表演說，本次會
議投稿共有 735 篇文章且來自 33 個不同的國家，其中，僅有百分之 69.4 的文章被
接受。而這些被接受的文章僅有半數是口頭發表其中百分之 21 為主動元件，百分之
31 為被動元件，百分之 31 為天線及電磁散射，最後百分之 21 為系統及應用，如下

二、與會心得 
    這次的研討會是在澳大利亞墨爾本舉辦，本次會議雖為亞洲區舉辦的微波會
議，但舉辦的地點在英語系國家澳洲，因此吸引了各個區域的研究學長前往參加，
會議舉辦共四天，內容相當之扎實，研討會分數個場地同時進行。參與的人員非常
多。本人除了於會場發表演說外，還帶了該篇文章的共同作者也就是我的博士班研
究生一同前往，在經過四天的研討會洗禮下，我們受益良多，有許多研究學者正在
做我們正進行的研究方向，而查覺到了相同的問題，但提出了不同的解決方案讓我
們對於電路研究上受益良多，而這次的會議台灣的學者參加相當的多，可見我國的
電磁技術研究及範疇已逐漸成長並在國際上有一席之地，在與國外學者討論的過程
當中，也有所收穫，未來相信在我國產官學界的通力合作之下可實現出高整合度的
微波技術，這也是本人在未來研究的方向。 
而另一方面，由於國內國家晶片系統中心提供學術界各種製程下線的機會，未來本
