Abstract 
We analyze a two-station hybrid MTO/MTS 
production system in two approaches proposed. 
Our objective is to study the relation between 
base-stock level and the fill rate of the ordinary 
demands and the response time of the specific 
demands. In Approach 1, we approximate the 
station 1 by an M/M/1 queue and station 2 by a 
G/M/1 queue; in Approach 2, we first reduce 
our 5-dimension state space into a 
two-dimension state space, then we use 
matrix-geometric method to solve the limiting 
probabilities and the corresponding performance 
measures. The analysis from Approach 1 and 
Approach will be verified and can be extend to 
multi-station systems. 
Assembly manufacturing plays a very important 
role in the global supply chain of consumer 
products, such as laptop computers. Assemblers, 
in addition to fulfill the ordinary demands for 
the standard products by adopting MTS 
production, are often asked to take care of the 
special demands for the custom products and to 
adopt MTO production. In usual cases, ordinary 
demands should be satisfied immediately, 
however, there is a time window for the special 
demand. To the assembler, it is not profitable to 
maintain a solo MTO production line 
exclusively for the special demand. In some case, 
custom products share almost all the parts of the 
standard products, therefore, the assembler 
usually consider embedding the MTO lines into 
the main stream MTS lines, which becomes a 
hybrid production system. The corresponding 
design and the control issues for the hybrid lines 
are important to the management. 
We consider a two-station hybrid MTO/MTS 
production system (see Fig.1) with stochastic 
ordinary and special demands, in which, the first 
station(station 1) is a MTS system providing the 
finished standard products for the ordinary 
demands. There is a base stock level for the 
1 
2.1 Approach 1 
We model station 1 as an inventory queue with 
two classes of demands: ordinary demands and 
special demands. Let the state be  where m 
denotes the number of finished standard 
products at end of station 1 and n denotes the 
number waiting orders from special at the end of 
station 1. Let

For studying the response time of the special 
demand, we consider the case when 1μλλ <+ os . 
Let  denote the response time of the nth 
special demand at station 2 and denote the 
waiting time in system of the nth combined 
order at station 2, then

Since the arrival process of the combined orders 
to station 2 is not a Poisson process, in this case, 
we consider the queueing system corresponding 
to the combined orders at station 2 as a G/M/1 
queue. Note that the waiting time in system of a 
combined order, denoted by , has the density 2W

for t > 0, a closed form for the c.d.f of  is as

Note that if u is our maximal lead time for a

2.2 Approach 2 
The system can also be described by a Markov 
process with states (m,n), where m is the sum of 
the number of finished standard products in 
finished standard products queue and the 
number of orders in combined order queue or 
under processing at station 2; n is the number of 
special demands in the special demands queue at 
station 2. That is, 21 NNm +=  and 3Bn = .We 
denote our state space 
( ){ }0,,,1,0,, ≥+==Ω nnSmnm … . We 
consider the system the station 1 will be idle if 
there are M WIP (works in process) between 
station 1 and station 2. Since it is a loss system 
for the ordinary demands, this system is stable 
under the condition 1<Sρ  and 12 <ρ  for 
any finite S where 1/ μλρ SS = , 22 / μλρ S= . 
The calculation of matrix geometric method is 
omitted. The state space with transition rates is 
depicted in Fig. 2.

model based on Approach 2 
From here we can obtain those important 
performance indexes of the system described as 
follows. Let  be fill rate of the ordinary 
demand.
