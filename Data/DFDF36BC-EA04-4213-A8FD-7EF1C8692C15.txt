一、中文摘要
一個圖形的帶寬是該圖形上相鄰頂點
之間最大編號差的最小值。圖形帶寬問題不
僅可以用在使矩陣運算最佳化，由於許多問
題都可以用圖形來模擬，包括在超大積體電
路的設計、平行計算網路嵌入問題等等。我
們常利用圖形來表示一個網路拓樸，以頂點
表示伺服器而以邊來表示兩伺服器間有直
接的連線。然而我們往往因為某些因素，需
要改變網路拓樸，在期望不改變帶寬值的條
件下，或增加線路，或減少線路。此時可以
視為在不改變原有圖形的帶寬值的條件
下，增加某些邊或減少某些邊。我們知道圖
形的邊數可能會影響其帶寬值，在增加邊後
的圖形為原有圖形的超圖形（ super
graph），其帶寬值可能增加或維持不變。而
在減少邊後的圖形為原來圖形的子圖，其帶
寬值可能減少或不變。本計畫針對在特定圖
形（特別是網路拓樸常用的圖形），研究加
減邊後對其帶寬值的影響。我們希望能找出
使帶寬值增加最少需要增加的邊數，以及使
帶寬值減少最少需要刪除的邊數。
關鍵詞：圖形帶寬、加邊、減邊
Abstract
The bandwidth of a graph is the minimum of
the maximum difference between labels of
vertices in the graph. The graph bandwidth
problem has been proved to be NP-Complete
in 1976. There are quite a few
approximation algorithms and bounds for an
arbitrary graph. Because of the important
application in parallel computation network,
the exact value of the common network
topology graphs bandwidth problem has been
thoroughly considered. Since the network
wiring might be changed for one reason or
another, it’s nature to ask how many edges we
can add to a graph without increasing the
bandwidth in the resulting super graph and
how many edges we have to delete from a
graph in order to decrease the bandwidth in
the resulting sub graph. In this project, we
consider the minimum number of edges whose
addition into the graph G will make the
resulting super graph H has ( ) ( )B H B G ,
for a given integer k, we consider the
minimum number of edges whose deletion
from the graph G will make the sub graph H
has ( ) ( )B H B G k  .
Keywords: graph bandwidth, edge addition,
edge deletion.
二、前言
The matrix bandwidth problem was
originally studied in 1950s and the graph
bandwidth has been studied independently
since 1962. Because of the wild area of
applications, graph bandwidth earned it ’ s
interesting since mid sixties. The graph
bandwidth can not only optimized the matrix
computation, but also optimize the routing
problem in VLSI layout and minimized the
dilation in the parallel computation network.
For the formal definition, let ( , )G V E be a
graph of n vertices. A proper labeling f of
G is a bijective function
 : ( ) 1, 2, ,f V G n  . The bandwidth
( )fB G of a proper labeling f of G is the
number
 ( ) max ( ) ( ) : ( )fB G f u f v uv E G   and
the bandwidth ( )B G of G is the number
( ) min ( ) :fB G B G f is a proper
numbering of G . A proper labeling f is
called a bandwidth labeling of G , if
