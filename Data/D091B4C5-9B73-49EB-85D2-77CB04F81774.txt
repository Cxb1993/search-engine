3 results and discussion Revealing the relationships between form and images 
 
2.1 Select KANSEI words 
 
Firstly, group brainstorming method was used to collect abundant KANSEI words, then by deleting or 
rename the adjectives, which were too similar or inappropriate, 63 KANSEI words were left. Secondly, 
by KJ method, which was developed for creative 63 words are integrated into nine groups representing 
semantic different separately. Eventually, three adjective vocabularies: 1) speed, 2) steady, 3) modern 
are confirmed by analyzing the relationship between each group. 
 
2.2 Select sample cars and form features 
 
After recruiting sample cars which were sold in Taiwan during 2004-2005, and by group discussing to 
deleting similar or inappropriate cars, 20 sedan cars were picked. In order to integrate the image of cars 
at the same level, these 20 cars were modified by computer software Illustrator version 12.0, on 5 
aspects as: 1) directions, 2) contract, 3) emblems, 4) number plate, 5) gray etc. After an experiment of 
image of these 20 modified cars on 3 KANSEI words, 8 cars were selected as the materials on main 
experiment (Figure 1).Additionally, in order to analysis the relationships between image and the form 
features, which were expressed with the combination of fixation and saccades data etc. from 
eye-tracking system, the form features of modified sample images were concluded as follow: A) grill, B) 
head lamp, C) intercooler, D) fog light, E) front wheel, F) side window, G) hood.(Figure 2)

3.2 Numbers of fixation 
 
The number of fixations is related to number of components that the user is required to process. (Figure 
5.)When searching for a single target, a large number of saccades indicates the user browsed many other 
objects prior to selecting the target. But a large number of fixations indicated a large attention. More 
fixations imply the user is spending more time interpreting or relating the component representations in the 
interface. There was no significant difference in fixation numbers by different adjectives. (F2,21=0.371, 
p>0.05). The average fixation numbers from the speedy adjective was 4.188 (sd=0.896), steady adjective was 
4.5 (sd=1.341), while the modern adjective produced average numbers of 4.33 (sd=1.09). There was also no 
significant difference in the overall scan trails produced by the female and male differences. We concluded 
that there were no significant differences in both scan trail and number of fixations by sex difference.

3.3 Regression 
 
Although establishing the new research facilitates the design of car profile which closely matches the target 
feeling, it is known that some factors are of high influence and others are of lesser significance. The purpose 
of the improvement approach is not to renovate all the design factors, but simply to redesign those factors 
which have a significant influence upon the feeling quality. In other world, the intention is to obtain the 
greatest improvement in feeling quality through the minimum of redesign activity. Therefore, it is a 
substantial phase to identify which of seven feature variables have the most significant influence upon the 
feeling quality. These evaluative data were analyzed with Multiple Linear Regression. 
 
3.3.1 Crucial control features in speed adjective 
 
Table 2 illustrated crucial control features in speedy adjective. To verify the crucial different while the 
associated control features, the original profiles were modified accordingly and a verification renovated 
image was performed. Initially, the most speedy auto profiles were selected to assess. (Table 2) By 
determining the crucial factors with Multiple Linear Regression, we sieve out the significant feature to verify 
the differences. For instance, the feature of the head light (i.e., variable-b) has crucial positive influences 
upon auto profile with speedy level. That is, head light will approach the positive speed level. When designer 
comes into a speedy auto, it would be consider high influence in head lamp.

深刻的影響到消費者在使用產品上的正確或迅速的程度。當然，目前也有多數的學者發
展了使用性評估的方法以評估使用性的容易與否。本論文利用 peer tutoring（同儕教學法）
發展了一套使用性評估的方法，主要因為 peer tutoring 是利用相互教學的概念以進行教
學，多數運用在兒童的教學，並且該法與焦點族群法或是發聲思考法等使用性的方法也
有些許相似的地方。因此本研究將曾運用於兒童教育的同儕教學法應用於向量繪圖軟體
的使用介面研究，並同時與傳統使用性評估方法中的共同發現法及發聲思考法比較。最
後目的在探討同儕教學法的實驗可行性，並提供未來使用性研究者應用於使用性研究的
實施建議。 
本研究共有三個實驗，實驗方法分別為同儕教學法、共同發現法與發聲思考法。經
實驗觀察獲得使用性問題中，包含同儕教學法有 71 項、共同發現法有 119 項、發聲思考
法有 77 項。研究分析依性質分為質性與數性兩個部份：質性研究的部份是將所獲得之使
用性問題依發生因素與使用能分類並比較方法之間的差異；數性研究的部份是將使用者
滿意度評價作單因子變異數分析與平均及標準差的散佈分析。 
研究結果發現，透過同儕教學法訊息傳遞的過程可有效了解使用者容易產生的問題
以及應用該法於成人實驗對象的使用性研究是可行的。比較三法得到，同儕教學法是受
測者最容易配合的的方法，共同發現法可發掘較多功能的問題並了解受測者對系統的看
法與喜好，發聲思考法對受測者有較大的負擔且較難配合研究者的實驗要求。最後並提
出未來研究者應用同儕教學法於使用性評估之實施建議。 
 
3.參加會議行程說明 
此行主要目的為參加會議並發表研究論文，之外因為抵達第一天為清晨時間因此利
用當天之空檔參觀著名的珍珠港等景點。 
第一天（1 月 10 日）：出發日，搭乘華航由中正機場飛往夏威夷，參觀珍珠港。 
第二天（1 月 11 日）：出席會議 
第三天（1 月 12 日）：出席會議（論文發表日） 
第四天（1 月 13 日）：出席會議 
第五天（1 月 14 日）：出席會議 
第六天（1 月 15 日）：回國 
 
二、與會心得 
此次所參加之研討會在性質上並非工業設計或相關領域的研討會，而是屬於人文與
藝術為主領域的研討會，也是個人繼去年(2005)第一次至義大利參加非設計相關的
ICPR18 研討會以及今年(2006)至底特律出席 SAE 後，繼續出席非設計領域的研討會，但
是出席之後深深感覺出席此次研討會是一次非常好的經驗。在抵達會場完成報到程序
後，首先發現的是有發表學者拿著幻燈片盒正在整理幻燈片，這情形已經可以是在一般
研討會很少有的情形了，或許是因為文學或藝術領域尚有學者習慣於以幻燈片進行發表
吧，也算是在一片電腦與數位掛帥的潮流中的一股特殊現象。 
這研討會一直在夏威夷舉行，參加的學者十分多當然也有許多國家的學者，個人認
為雖然與舉辦地點的選擇影關係之外，應該也與研討會的屬性建立有關。在議題上廣泛
的與 Arts & Humanity 為訴求，因此人文藝術領域以及設計領域都可以與此議題相關，
因此也得以吸引或允許多數的學者參加。

peer tutoring approach also has a feature of easy executed since its low loading on both 
time and mental. The co-discovery method is the better method for observing various 
functions and understanding experimenters’ opinions and favors. On the contrary, 
thinking-aloud method need the most cognitive loading of the experimenters between 
three methods also is cleared.
