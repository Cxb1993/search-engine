frequency offsets. Various algorithms for 
estimating frequency offsets have been reported 
[3]-[5]. For example, [3] develops a low 
complexity, yet reasonably accurate frequency 
offset estimation algorithm, where a training 
symbol composed of two or more identical parts 
in the time domain is adopted so the estimation 
range can be dynamically extended to be wider 
than the subcarrier spacing. This approach, 
however, is not applicable to multi-user 
environment. In [4], [5], the frequency offset 
estimation problem is addressed in the 
MIMO-OFDM or single user scenario, where 
antenna arrays are used to greatly improve the 
estimation accuracy. However, if we allow  
channel interferences (CCIs) and multiple 
access interferences (MAIs) to exist in the same 
frequency band as the target signal so as to 
increase the overall network throughput, the 
aforementioned frequency offset estimation 
algorithms, blind or non-blind, with single or 
multiple antennas, would simply fail. Also, in 
current wireless OFDM WLAN, active and  
passive CCIs protection mechanism such as 
carrier sense multiple access/carrier avoidance 
(CSMA/CA) and clear to send/request to send 
(CTS/RTS) are employed to prevent CCIs and 
packet collision. However, both schemes 
consume additional overhead, thus reducing the 
total throughput. Therefore, we present an 
antenna-array-assisted approach to jointly 
estimate the nominal DOAs and frequency 
offsets, and detect data in uplink MIMO-OFDM 
wireless networks. The proposed approach can 
cooperate with upper medium access control 
(MAC) layer to allow the co-existence of CCIs 
and MAIs to enhance the data rate, thus  tailing 
high channel capacity in MIMO-OFDM. To 
achieve this, two MUSIC[6]-based algorithms 
are first considered to jointly estimate the 
nominal DOAs and frequency offsets of the 
incoming rays. The first algorithm is to 
simultaneously estimate these two parameters 
based on the 2-D MUSIC. To alleviate the 
computational overhead, the second algorithm 
utilizes the spatial and temporal data structures 
to estimate the nominal DOAs and frequency 
offsets in an SFS hierarchical tree structure, 
where two S-MUSICs and one F-MUSIC are 
employed alternatively to estimate the nominal 
DOAs and frequency offsets, respectively. Also, 
a spatial beamforming process and a temporal 
filtering process are invoked after the S-MUSIC 
and F-MUSIC, respectively, to partition the 
signals into appropriate groups to enhance the 
estimation accuracy. Furthermore, the estimated 
nominal DOAs and frequency offsets are 
automatically paired due to the tree-structured 
estimation scheme. Thereafter, a data detection 
procedure, based on the estimated nominal DOA 
and frequency offset, is also addressed to detect 
the transmitted symbols.

Data Model 
Consider an indoor MIMO-OFDM WLAN 
uplink scenario as shown in Fig. 1. Assume that 
the number of antennas at the access point (AP) 
is RM and that at the STA is TM , The

can be written as

where the column vectors of ssV  and 
s

the eigenvectors that span the signal subspace 
and noise subspace of sR , respectively. We can 
then have a rough estimate of the nominal

The estimated coarse nominal DOAs can, 
nevertheless, help us decouple the signals into 
several groups with signals in each group 
having very close (or the same) nominal DOAs 
but different frequency offsets. Such a 
decoupling process can enhance the estimation 
accuracy of the MUSIC algorithm. 
To achieve the grouping process, we 
construct p  spatial beamforming matrices 
{ }s , = 1,2,...,i i pF , where siF  is a 
complementary projection matrix given by  
s s s= ,  = 1,2,...,i i i i p

and the superscript + denotes matrix Pseudo

The spatially-filtered signals can then be 
written as  
s= , = 1, ,i i i p

which includes only the thi  signal group 
corresponding to the estimated  iθ . Next, we 
compute the temporal covariance matrix of each

form a set of temporal filtering matrices given

The ambiguity of γ  can be overcome by 
differential encoding and decoding. Single path 
OFDM signal can be detected by taking the 
inverse fast Fourier transform of 1ˆ{ ( )}s n  and 
the detection performance can be improved by 
maximal ratio combining (MRC). 
As a whole, the proposed joint parameters 
estimation and data detection procedure is as 
illustrated in Fig. 2.  
 
Simulations and Discussions 
Computer simulations are conducted in 
this section to demonstrate the proposed 
approaches. Assume that the numbers of 
antennas at AP1 and STA are both equal to 4, 
the number of subchannels in OFDM networks 
is N =64, the number of STAs is K =2 and the 
number of path clusters is = 3L . There are 
two targeted path clusters for STA1. The 
nominal DOAs of the STAs are [-3 5 25]
o
, and 
the frequency offsets between the AP1 and 
STAs are [-0.5 0.33 0.33] with respect to the 
intercarrier spacing. The average fading 
amplitude for all signals are equal and 
normalized to 0 dB. Both of the SODE MUSIC 
and SFS MUSIC are carried out for joint 
nominal DOA-frequency offset estimation. 50 
symbols across packets are employed in the 
uplink MIMO-OFDM network for the 
estimation of nominal DOAs and frequency 
offsets. 
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the root mean 
square errors (RMSEs) of the estimates of the 
nominal DOAs and frequency offsets, 
respectively, based on the estimates of SODE 
MUSIC and SFS MUSIC. The RMSEs of the 
nominal DOAs and frequency offsets using the 
S-MUSIC and F-MUSIC alone without the 
beamforming/filtering processes and the 
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) are also 
furnished for comparison. Fig. 5 shows the 
resulting BER performance based on the 
estimated nominal DOAs-frequency offsets 
using these three algorithms, based on perfect 
channel state information (know nominal DOAs 
and frequency offsets) and single user bound 
(SUB). We can note that from Figs. 3 and 4 that 
the 1-D F-MUSIC and 1-D S-MUSIC alone can 
not resolve the nominal DOAs and frequency 
offsets, respectively, with close nominal DOAs
