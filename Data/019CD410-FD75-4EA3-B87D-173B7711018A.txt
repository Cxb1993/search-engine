ABSTRACT 
 Experiments have been conducted here to investigate how the imposed time periodic 
refrigerant flow rate or heat flux oscillation affects the saturated and subcooled flow 
boiling heat transfer and associated bubble characteristics for refrigerants R-134a, R-407C 
and R-410A and for dielectric coolant FC-72. Besides, the evaporation heat transfer of 
R-134a flow in the same duct are examined. The test section for the horizontal annular duct 
consists of an outer pipe made of Pyrex glass and an inner heated copper pipe, intending to 
measure the boiling heat transfer coefficient and to facilitate the visualization of boiling 
processes. A cartridge heater is installed inside the inner pipe to provide the required heat 
flux to the refrigerant flow in the narrow annular duct. In the study the gap of the duct is 
varied from 1.0 to 5.0 mm with the mean refrigerant mass flux, saturated temperature, 
imposed heat flux and mean vapor quality respectively ranging from 100 to 600 kg/m2s, 5 
to 15℃, 0 to 45 kW/m2 and 0.05 to 0.95. The inlet subcooling is varied from 3 to 6℃. In 
particular, attention is focused on the time periodic flow boiling characteristics affected by 
the mean levels, amplitudes and periods of the flow rate or heat flux oscillation.   
 Some results have been obtained and are reported here. In the first part of the present 
study, experiments have been carried out to investigate the effects of the imposed time 
periodic refrigerant flow rate oscillation in the form of nearly a triangular wave on the 
saturated and subcooled flow boiling and evaporation heat transfer and associated bubble 
characteristics of refrigerants R-134a, R-407C and R-410A and for dielectric coolant 
FC-72. The results indicate that when the imposed heat flux is close to that for the onset of 
stable flow boiling, intermittent flow boiling appears in which nucleate boiling on the 
heated surface only exists in a partial time interval of each periodic cycle. But the 
intermittent boiling prevails in narrower ranges of the experimental parameters in the 
subcooled flow boiling. At somewhat higher heat flux persistent boiling prevails. Besides, 
the refrigerant flow rate oscillation is found to negligibly affect the time-average boiling 
curves and heat transfer coefficients. Moreover, the heated wall temperature, bubble 
departure diameter and frequency, active nucleation site density, and evaporating flow 
pattern are noted to oscillate periodically in time as well and at the same frequency as the 
imposed mass flux oscillation. Furthermore, in the persistent boiling the resulting Tw 
oscillation is stronger for a longer period and a larger amplitude of the mass flux oscillation. 
And for a larger amplitude of the mass flux oscillation, stronger temporal oscillations in dp, 
f and nac are noted. Specifically, in the first half of the periodic cycle in which the mass 
flux decreases with time the departing bubbles are larger and the departure rate is lower but 
 v
amplitude of the imposed heat flux oscillation and for a higher mean imposed heat flux. A 
significant time lag in the Tw oscillation is noted. In the first half of the periodic cycle in 
which the heat flux decreases with time, after the time lag the heated wall temperature 
decreases with time, so does the bubble parameters. The opposite processes occur in the 
second half of the cycle in which q increases with time. Finally, flow regime maps are 
provided to delineate the boundaries separating different boiling regimes for the R-134a 
saturated and subcooled flow boiling in the annular duct.   
 Moreover, at the intermediate vapor quality changes in the evaporating flow patterns 
between that dominated by the nucleation bubbles and by the liquid film resulting from the 
heat flux oscillation take place cyclically. Furthermore, after the time lag the heated pipe 
wall temperature decreases and the evaporation heat transfer gets worse as the heat flux 
decreases in the first half of the periodic cycle. In the second half of the cycle in which the 
heat flux increases the opposite processes occur. These changes of the heating surface 
temperature and heat transfer coefficient with the heat flux oscillation are attributed to the 
strong effects of the heat flux oscillation on the changes of the vapor quality and liquid 
film thickness in the evaporating flow.

removal rate, but the power dissipation in IC chips are often time dependent in practical 
operation. Therefore, the transient oscillatory flow boiling resulting from varying heat load 
needs to be explored. 
In view of the possible enhancement of heat transfer in small channels, we require to 
develop smaller and more compact evaporators and condensers. Despite the great effort has 
been paid to the investigation of single- and two-phase flow and heat transfer in small 
channels from the heat transfer research community, the detailed heat transfer mechanisms 
in the small-channel flow boiling remain controversial. A detailed understanding of the 
phase-change processes in-small channel flow subject to time varying coolant flow rate or 
imposed heat flux is essential in thermal design for electronics cooling and air-conditioning 
and refrigeration systems. Although considerable research has been carried out in the past 
for the two-phase flow and heat transfer under the condition of fixed flow rate and imposed 
heat flux, the corresponding research for the transient oscillatory flow rate or imposed heat 
flux remains largely unexplored. In the present study an initial attempt is made to unravel 
how the characteristics of flow boiling and associated heat transfer and bubble motion in a 
narrow annular channel are affected by given time periodic refrigerant flow rate or 
imposed heat flux oscillation. 
1.2 Literature Review 
In sizing the small channels, Kandlikar and Grande [1] proposed that Dh >3mm for 
the conventional channels, 200μm< Dh <3mm for the mini-channels, 10μm < Dh <200μm 
for the micro-channels, 0.1μm < Dh <10μm for the transitional channels, 1μm < Dh <10μm 
for the transitional micro-channels, 0.1μm < Dh <1μm for the transitional nano-channels, 
and Dh≤ 0.1μm for the molecular nano-channels. On the other hand, Kew and Cornwell [2] 
introduced a dimensionless group named as the Confinement number,
0.5

h
(σ/(gΔρ))N =
D
, 
which represents the importance of the restriction of the flow by the small size of the 
channel. They showed that when Nconf >0.5, the effects of the channel size become very 
important. 
1.2.1 Stable Flow Boiling Heat Transfer  
The literature on stable flow boiling heat transfer is reviewed at first. Here the stable 
flow boiling denotes the boiling subject to constant imposed flow rate and heat flux. It is 
 4
range of flow conditions. A similar study from Tran et al. [11] examined flow boiling of 
refrigerant R-12 in small circular and rectangular channels (Dh=2.46, 2.4 mm). Two 
distinct two-phase flow regions were noted, convective boiling dominant region at lower 
wall superheat (< 2.75K) and nucleate boiling dominant region at higher wall superheat (> 
2.75K). Kandlikar and Steinke [12] noted that for a high liquid-vapor density ratio (ρl/ρg), 
the convective effects dominated as the vapor quality increased. This led to an increasing 
trend in the boiling heat transfer coefficient at increasing vapor quality. A high Boiling 
number results in a higher nucleate boiling contribution, which tends to decrease as the 
vapor quality increases. This leads to a decreasing trend in heat transfer coefficient with 
increasing vapor quality. Oh et al. [13] examined flow boiling heat transfer characteristics 
of R-134a in a capillary tube heat exchanger (Dh=2, 1, 0.75 mm). Their data showed that 
the heat transfer in the forced convection dominated region was more influenced by the 
mass flux than by the Boiling number and the heat transfer coefficient was controlled by 
the Reynolds number. 
Yin et al. [14] investigated the subcooled flow boiling heat transfer for refrigerant 
R-134a flowing in a horizontal annular duct. The gap of duct is 5.16 mm. They found that 
boiling heat transfer is insignificantly affected by the mass flux, imposed heat flux and  
refrigerant saturation temperature. But a decrease in the inlet subcooling results in much 
better heat transfer. Chen et al. [15] investigate how the channel size affects the subcooled 
flow boiling heat transfer of refrigerant R-407C in a horizontal narrow annular duct(Dh = 
1.0 and 2.0 mm). They indicated that the temperature overshoot at ONB is relatively 
significant. Besides, the subcooled flow boiling heat transfer coefficient increases with a 
reduction in the duct gap, but decreases with an increase in the inlet liquid subcooling.  
1.2.2 Time Dependent Flow Boiling Heat Transfer 
In examining two-phase flow instabilities in a circular channel (Dh=9.525mm), 
Comakli et al [16] found that the periods and amplitudes of the pressure drop and density 
wave type oscillations decreased with decreasing mass flow rate and increased with 
decreasing inlet temperature. Recently, some detailed characteristics associated with these 
intrinsic instabilities were investigated through experimental measurement and theoretical 
modeling. An experimental investigation of thermal instabilities in forced convection 
boiling of R-11 in a vertical annular channel (Dh =17 mm) was conducted by Kakac et al. 
[17]. Two-phase homogeneous model along with the thermodynamic equilibrium 
 6
constitutive model containing a cubic nonlinearity combined with a homogeneous 
two-phase flow model to simulate the pressure-drop oscillation. Their prediction is 
matched with the measured data. Later, the channel wall heat capacity effects were 
included [24] to allow the wall temperature and heat transfer coefficient to vary with time. 
1.2.3 Flow Patterns and Bubble Characteristics 
To elucidate the flow boiling heat transfer mechanisms in small channels, we require 
to delineate the prevailing flow regimes. Cornwell and Kew [25] examined various flow 
regimes for boiling of refrigerant R-113 in a vertical rectangular multi-channel with Dh = 
1.03 and 1.64 mm. Based on visualization of the flow and measurement of the heat transfer, 
three flow regimes have been suggested, namely, the isolated bubble, confined bubble and 
annular-slug bubble flows. In the isolated bubble regime, heat transfer coefficient depends 
on the heat flux and hydraulic diameter. In the confined bubble regime, heat transfer 
coefficient depends on the heat flux, mass flux, vapor quality and hydraulic diameter. 
While in the annular-slug bubble regime, heat transfer coefficient depends on the mass flux, 
vapor quality and hydraulic diameter. 
However, bubble characteristics such as bubble departure frequency, growth, sliding 
and departure size are known to play an important role in flow boiling heat transfer. 
Visualization of subcooled flow boiling of upward water flow in a vertical annular channel 
(Dh=19 mm) by Situ et al. [26] suggested that generally the bubble departure frequency 
increased as the heat flux increased. The averaged bubble growth rate drops sharply after 
lift-off. An experimental analysis was carried out by Thorncroft et al. [27] to investigate 
the vapor bubble growth and departure in vertical upflow and downflow boiling of FC-87. 
They found that the bubble growth rate and bubble departure diameter increased with the 
Jacob number(increasing △Tsat) and decreased at increasing mass flux in both the upflow 
and downflow. Hsieh et al. [3] examined saturated flow boiling heat transfer and associated 
bubble characteristics of R-410A in a horizontal annular duct. They concluded that a higher 
refrigerant mass flux results in a smaller bubble departing size and a higher bubble 
departure frequency.  
Kandlikar [28] examined the subcooled flow boiling of water in a rectangular 
horizontal channel. They noted that the bubble growth was slow at high subcooling and the 
departure diameter decreased as the flow rate increased. The influence of the heat flux on 
 8
replaced by the Weber number to eliminate viscous effects in favor of the surface tension. 
Similar correlations were proposed by Fujita et al. [6]. 
Kandlikar [39] proposed a general correlation for saturated flow boiling heat transfer 
inside horizontal and vertical tubes. The correlation was based on a model utilizing the 
contributions due to nucleate boiling and convective mechanisms. In a following study 
[40,41], he developed correlations to predict transition, laminar and deep laminar flows in 
minichannels and microchannels. A new correlation for boiling heat transfer in small 
diameter channels was proposed by Kew and Cornwell [2]. The correlation was divided by 
three flow regimes based on the values of the Confinement number. Some empirical 
correlation equations proposed in the literature for flow boiling heat transfer coefficients in 
the small channels were summarized in Table 1.2. 
1.3 Objective of the Present Study 
In recent years, environmental concerns over the use of CFCs as working fluids in 
refrigeration and air-conditioning systems have led to the development of alternative 
refrigerants. Among these alternatives, refrigerants R-134a, R-407C and R-410A are often 
used as substitutes for refrigerant HCFC-22. But the above literature review clearly 
indicates that the unsteady flow boiling heat transfer of HFC refrigerants in small diameter 
channels resulting from time varying mass flux and/or heat flux remains largely 
unexplored. In this study, the R-134a flow boiling and evaporation heat transfer in an 
annular duct with a small gap between the inner and outer ducts subject to a time periodic 
mass flux and/or heat flux oscillation with a constant imposed heat flux and/or mass flux 
are investigated. The effects of the imposed heat flux, gap size, vapor quality, amplitude 
and period of the mass flux and/or heat flux oscillation, inlet subcooling, and saturation 
temperature of refrigerant R-134a on the temporal boiling heat transfer characteristics will 
be examined in detail. Particularly, flow visualization is conducted to examine the bubble 
characteristics associated with the time periodic flow boiling, intending to improve our 
understanding of the unsteady flow boiling processes in the narrow channel.

refrigerant to a specified refrigerant state before entering the test section. The vapor 
generated in the test section is reliquefied in an oversized condenser/subcooler in the cold 
water-glycol loop. Leaving the subcooler, the liquid refrigerant flows back to the receiver 
at the bottom of the system. An accumulator is connected to a high-pressure nitrogen tank 
to dampen the fluctuations of the flow rate and pressure. The filter/dryer is used to filter the 
impurities and noncondensable gas possibly existing in the loop. Varying the temperature 
and flow rate of the water-glycol mixture flowing through the condenser and subcooler 
allows us to control the pressure of the refrigerant loop. Two absolute pressure transducers 
are respectively installed at the inlet and exit of the test section with a resolution up to ±
2kPa. All the refrigerant and water temperatures are measured by copper-constantan 
thermocouples (T-type) with a calibrated accuracy of ±0.2℃. The test section is thermally 
insulated with a polyethylene insulation layer of 19.5 mm thick so that heat loss from it can 
be reduced significantly.  
2.2.1 Test Section (Annular Duct)  
 The boiling of refrigerant R-134a in an annular duct with a small clearance between 
the inner and outer pipes is explored. As schematically shown in Fig. 2.3, the test section of 
the experimental apparatus is a horizontal annular duct with the outer pipe made of Pyrex 
glass to permit the visualization of boiling processes in the refrigerant flow. The outer 
Pyrex glass pipe is 160-mm long and 4-mm thick with inside diameter of 20 mm. Both 
ends of the pipe are connected with a copper tube of the same size by means of flanges and 
are sealed by O-rings. The inner smooth pipe has 10.0, 16.0 or 18.0 mm nominal outside 
diameter (the pipe wall thickness is 1.0, 1.5 or 2.5 mm) and is 0.41 m long, so that the 
hydraulic diameter of the annular duct Dh is 10.0, 4.0 or 2.0 mm ( corresponding to the gap 
size of 5.0, 2.0 or 1.0 mm for the duct). Note that the outside surface of the inner pipe is 
polished by fine sandpaper. In order to insure the gap between the ducts being uniform, we 
first measure the average outside diameter of the inner pipe and the mean inside diameter 
of the Pyrex glass pipe by digital calipers having a resolution of 0.001mm. The absolute 
accuracy of the measurement is in the range of 0.01 mm. Then we photo the top and side 
view pictures of the annular ducts and measure the average distance between the inside 
surface of the Pyrex glass pipe and the outside surface of the inner tube, with an absolute 
accuracy also in the range of 0.01mm. From the above procedures the duct gap is 
 16
cylindrical Teflon block, a cylindrical Teflon bolt, a copper plate, two pieces of mica plates, 
a Teflon plate, and an electric-heater. The diameter of the copper plate is 10 mm and the 
plate is 2 mm thick and is heated by passing DC current through the electric-heater. 
Besides, three thermocouples are fixed at the back surface of the copper plate to estimate 
the temperature of the upper surface of the copper plate and another two thermocouples are 
fixed at the top and bottom surface of the electric-heater to measure their surface 
temperatures. The locations of the thermocouples at the backside of the copper plate and at 
the electric-heater surface are shown in Fig. 2.9. The mica plates are placed between the 
heater and copper plate and between the heater and Teflon plate, intending to prevent the 
leaking of the DC current to the copper plate. The detailed structure of the module is 
shown in Fig. 2.10. The magnitude of heat loss from each surface of the cylindrical-hollow 
Teflon block can be evaluated from the temperature measured at selected locations in the 
block. Locations of the thermocouples are schematically shown in Fig. 2.11.   
2.3 Water Loop for Preheater 
 In order to maintain the preset refrigerant temperature and vapor quality at the test 
section inlet, a water loop is used to preheat the refrigerant before it arrives at the inlet. The 
water loop for the preheater system includes a double-tube heat exchanger, having a heat 
transfer area of 0.12m2, a 125-liter hot water container with three 2.0-kW heaters in it, and 
a 0.5-hp water pump which can deliver the hot water at specified temperature and flow rate 
to the preheater. In the preheater the hot water passes through the outer pipe while the 
liquid refrigerant flows in the inner pipe. The water flow rate is controlled by an AC motor 
through the change of the inverter frequency and by the by-pass valve. The connecting 
pipe between the preheater and test section is thermally insulated with a 5-cm thick 
polyethylene layer to reduce the heat loss from the pipe. 
2.4 Water-Glycol Loop 
 The water-glycol loop is designed for condensing the refrigerant vapor and for 
subcooling the liquid refrigerant. The water-glycol loop is cooled by a water cooled R-22 
refrigeration system. The cooling capacity is 3.5-kW for the water-glycol mixture at -20℃. 
The cold water-glycol mixture at a specified flow rate is driven by a 0.5-hp pump to the 
condenser as well as to the subcooler. A by-pass loop is provided to adjust the flow rate. By 
 18
density in a periodic cycle are calculated by viewing more than 1,000 frames at each time 
instant.   
2.7 Data Acquisition 
 The data acquisition system includes a recorder (Yokogawa MX-100), a 24V-3A 
power supply, and a controller. The water flowmeter and differential pressure transducer 
need the power supply as a driver to output an electric current of 4 to 20 mA. The data 
signals are collected and converted by a hybrid recorder (Micro Motion RFT9739). The 
converted signals are then transmitted to a host computer through a GPIB interface for 
further calculation.  
 The system automatically monitors all the T-Type thermocouples, pressure 
transducers, differential pressure transducer and mass flowmeters. The thermodynamic and 
transport properties of the refrigerants are obtained by a manual from AlliedSignal Co. Ltd. 
and by the ASHRAE handbook [82].  
2.8 Experimental Procedures 
 Before a test is started, the temperature of the refrigerant R-134a under investigation 
in the test section is compared with its saturation temperature corresponding to the 
measured saturation pressure and the allowable difference is kept in the range of 0.2-0.3K. 
Otherwise, the system is re-evacuated and then re-charged to remove the air existing in the 
refrigerant loop. A vacuum pump is used to evacuate noncondensable gases in the system 
to a low pressure of 0.067 pa in the loop. In the test for the time periodic flow boiling the 
refrigerant at the inlet of the test section is first maintained at the liquid state (x = 0) and its 
temperature is kept at the time-average saturated temperature corresponding to the 
time-average refrigerant pressure or at the preset subcooled temperature by adjusting the 
water-glycol temperature and flow rate. While for the test of the time periodic evaporation 
the inlet vapor quality for the refrigerant is also controlled at the preset level. In addition, 
we adjust the thermostat temperature in the water loop to stabilize the refrigerant 
temperature at the test section inlet. Next, the temperature and flow rate of the hot-water 
loop for the preheater are adjusted to keep the vapor quality of R-134a at the test section 
inlet at the desired value. Then, we regulate the time-average refrigerant pressure at the test 
section inlet by adjusting the opening of the gate valve locating right after the exit of the

DATA REDUCTION 
 
 Data reduction analyses are needed in present study to deduce the time periodic 
subcooled, saturated flow boiling and evaporation heat transfer coefficients in the 
horizontal annular duct from the measured raw data.  
3.1 Single-Phase Heat Transfer Coefficient  
 The imposed heat flux to the refrigerant flow in the annular duct is calculated on the 
basis of the total power input Qt and the total outside heat transfer area of the inner pipe 
of the annular duct As. The total power input is computed from the product of the 
measured voltage drop across the cartridge heater and the electric current passing through 
it. Hence the net power input to the refrigerant flow in the test section Qn is equal to (Qt – 
Qloss). The imposed heat flux at the outside surface of the inner pipe is then evaluated 
from the relation  
                   sn AQq /=  (3.1) 
 The total heat loss from the test section Qloss is evaluated from the correlation for 
natural convection around a circular cylinder by Churchill and Chu [83]. Their correlation 
is

CHAPTER 4 
Time Periodic Saturated Flow Boiling Heat Transfer of R-134a and Associated 
Bubble Characteristics in a Narrow Annular Duct due to Flow Rate 
Oscillation 
 
 
 The present time periodic R-134a flow boiling experiment is performed for the mean 
refrigerant mass flux G  varying from 100 to 600 kg/m2s, imposed heat flux q from 0 to 45 
kW/m2, and mean system pressure P  set at 414.6 kPa and 488.6 kPa ( corresponding to the 
mean R-134a saturation temperature satT =10℃ and 15℃) for the gap of the duct δ= 1.0, 2.0 
and 5.0 mm. Besides, the amplitude of the refrigerant mass flux oscillation GΔ  is set at 0, 10, 
20 and 30% of G . Moreover, the period of the mass flux oscillation pt  is fixed at 20, 30, 60 
and 120 seconds. The ranges of the parameters chosen above for the mass flux oscillation are in 
accordance with the practical operation of variable speed compressors in some air-conditioners 
and refrigerators subject to fast changing thermal load. In the following, attention will be mainly 
paid to examining the effects of the amplitude and period of the refrigerant mass flux oscillation 
on the time periodic R-134a flow boiling heat transfer performance. Note that for the limiting 
case of G / GΔ = 0% we have saturated flow boiling of R-134a at a constant refrigerant mass 
flow rate in the test section, which is designated as 〝stable flow boiling〞and has been 
investigated by Lie and Lin [21]. The measured boiling heat transfer data are expressed in terms 
of the boiling curve and boiling heat transfer coefficient. The thermal characteristics of the time 
periodic flow boiling is illustrated by the time variations of the instantaneous heated pipe wall 
temperature Tw and boiling heat transfer coefficient hr. Moreover, selected flow photos and data 
deduced from the images of the boiling processes are presented to show the bubble 
characteristics in the boiling flow.  
 The time constant ct  associated with the response of the heated wall temperature to the 
time dependent refrigerant flow rate is an important physical quantity in the time periodic flow 
boiling. It is measured directly here from the time response of Tw subject to a step change in the 
mass flux for various q. The measured data show that ct  is about 16.0 seconds which is known 
to mainly result from the thermal inertia of the heated pipe wall.  
4.1 Single-Phase Heat Transfer  
 Before beginning the flow boiling experiments, the single-phase convective heat transfer 
experiments are conducted for liquid R-134a. The measured single-phase convection heat 
 40 
earlier bubble nucleation for a smaller gap. Then, the data shown in Fig. 4.4(b) indicate that the 
saturated boiling heat transfer increases noticeably with a decrease in the channel gap. Since the 
shear stress of the flow acting on the heated surface in a smaller channel is higher, the bubbles on 
the heating surface can be more easily swept away from the heated surface. Moreover, the flow 
pattern change from the bubbly flow to the slug flow for δ= 1.0 mm occurs at a lower imposed 
heat flux than that for δ= 2.0 mm. These effects are thought to be the main reasons for the 
enhancement of flow boiling heat transfer when the channel size is reduced.  
4.3 Time Dependent Flow Boiling Heat Transfer Characteristics  
 The time periodic flow boiling heat transfer characteristics for R-134a flow in the annular 
duct resulting from the periodic refrigerant mass flux oscillation are illustrated in Figs. 4.5 - 4.8 
by presenting the time variations of the heated wall temperature and boiling heat transfer 
coefficients at the middle axial location in the statistical state for various G , satT , ΔG/G , tp , q 
and δ. For clear illustration, the measured data for the time variations of the imposed 
refrigerant mass flux are also given here. The results manifest that when G oscillates periodically 
in time nearly like a triangular wave, significant temporal oscillations in Tw and hr can occur. 
Note that the Tw and hr oscillations are also periodic in time and are at the same frequency as the 
mass flux. Besides, the Tw and hr oscillations get stronger for a higher amplitude and a longer 
period of the mass flux oscillation. However, the amplitude of the Tw oscillation varies 
nonmonotonically with the imposed heat flux. Note that single-phase forced convection prevails 
in the duct at a relatively low imposed heat flux. The data given in Figs. 4.5 - 4.8 further reveals 
that the Tw and hr oscillations slightly lag the mass flux oscillation. This time lag apparently 
results from the thermal inertia of the heated pipe wall. Moreover for the single-phase convection 
at low q and in the first half of the periodic cycle in which the mass flux decreases with time, the 
wall temperature is found to rise with time, suggesting that the single-phase convection heat 
transfer over the heated surface is poorer at a lower G. The opposite process occurs in the second 
half of the cycle. It is further noted in the experiment that at a low q the wall temperature of the 
heating surface is lower than that required for the onset of nucleate boiling and no bubble 
nucleates from the heating surface. Hence heat transfer in the flow results completely from the 
single-phase forced convection. As the imposed wall heat flux is raised gradually, the wall 
temperature increases correspondingly. The corresponding Tw oscillation amplitude can be 
significant, as evident from the curve for q = 3.0 kW/m2 in Fig. 4.5(c). At a certain higher wall 
temperature for a small increase in q bubbles start to nucleate from the heated surface at certain 
instant of time but bubble nucleation is not seen in the whole cycle. Thus, we have intermittent 
boiling in the flow in which nucleate boiling only exists in partial duration of the periodic cycle. 
The time instants for the start and termination of the nucleate boiling are marked on the curves 
 42 
the single-phase and boiling flow. Specifically, Tw increases as G decreases in the single-phase 
flow but in the boiling flow Tw decreases as G decreases. Thus as the bubble nucleation starts to 
appear in the single-phase flow the Tw oscillation is weakened. This trend continues until the 
boiling flow dominates over the single-phase flow for a rise in q to a certain level. Then, the Tw 
oscillation gets stronger for a higher q. In the persistent boiling regime at high imposed heat flux 
the Tw oscillation gets gradually stronger for a higher q up to about q = 30 kW/m2. Beyond that 
the wall temperature oscillation nearly levels off. It is worth to note from the data given in Fig. 
4.9(a) that at the low G  of 300 kg/m2s the Tw oscillation decays noticeably with q in the 
persistent boiling. This stronger Tw oscillation at a lower G  is attributed to the associated 
stronger boiling ebullition on the heated surface with the accompanying weaker single-phase 
convection. While at the intermediate G  of 400 kg/m2s the variation of the Tw oscillation 
amplitude with q is small in the persistent boiling regime. Specifically, at intermediate imposed 
heat flux in the intermittent and persistent boiling Tw oscillates in a larger amplitude at a lower 
G  but the opposite trend prevails at high q in the persistent boiling. The results in Fig. 4.9 also 
indicate that the Tw oscillation is stronger for a higher amplitude and a longer period of the mass 
flux oscillation. At the low pt  of 20 seconds, which is only slightly larger than the time constant 
of the present system, the Tw oscillation is rather weak (Fig. 4.9(d)), reflecting that the heated 
wall is unable to respond instantly to the fast mass flux oscillation for a pt  around or below ct . 
But the mean refrigerant mass flux exhibits a nonmonotonic effect on the amplitude of the Tw 
oscillation, as evident from the data in Fig. 4.9(a). Specifically, at intermediate imposed heat flux 
in the intermittent and persistent boiling Tw oscillates in a larger amplitude at a lower G  but the 
opposite trend prevails at high q in the persistent boiling. However, the mean saturated 
temperature of the refrigerant shows a relatively insignificant effect on the amplitude of the Tw 
oscillation (Fig. 4.9(b)). It is also noted that for all cases tested in the persistent boiling for q＞
10.0 kW/m2 the amplitude of the Tw oscillation is less that 10% of the wall superheat. But in the 
intermittent boiling 
wT
A  can be as high as 25% of satΔT . Then, the data shown in Fig. 4.9(e) 
indicate that Tw oscillation increases noticeably with a increase in the channel gap in the 
persistent flow boiling for q＞20.0 kW/m2. At the lower q the effects of duct gap on the 
amplitude of the Tw oscilation is milder. Moreover, for given G , ΔG/G , satT , pt  and δ the 
variation of the amplitude of the Tw oscillation with the imposed heat flux is also nonmonotonic.  
4.4 Intermittent Flow Boiling  
 It is of interest to note in the visualization of the boiling flow in the annular duct that over a 
certain intermediate range of the imposed heat flux the intermittent boiling appears. More 
specifically, in a typical periodic cycle of the refrigerant mass flux oscillation bubble nucleation 
 44 
and a lot of coalescence bubbles appear. More coalescence bubbles are seen and they are 
confined by the duct walls to become slightly deformed for a further increase in q. At even 
higher q the duct is mainly filled with the coalescence bubbles. They also reported that at a 
higher refrigerant mass flux the bubble departure frequency was higher and the bubbles were 
smaller and in violent agitating motion. However, the active nucleation site density is lower at a 
higher mass flux. But at the lower mass flux the bubble coalescence is more important and a 
number of bigger bubbles form in the duct. Then, at a lower saturation temperature of the 
refrigerant the bubbles were found to grow bigger and depart at a lower rate, and the active 
nucleation site density is lower due to the higher surface tension and enthalpy of vaporization.  
 By and large, in the time periodic flow boiling investigated here the effects of the imposed 
heat flux and mean refrigerant mass flux and saturation temperature on the bubble behavior 
exhibit similar trends to that in the stable flow boiling. Hence, we fisrt illustrate here how the 
time periodic bubble characteristics are affected by the amplitude and period of the mass flux 
oscillation for the persistent boiling in Fig. 4.12 by presenting the photos of the boiling flow for 
the cases with the imposed heat flux well above that required for ONB in a small region around 
the middle axial location at eight selected time instants in a typical periodic cycle in the 
statistical state. In the figure the symbol “ t = to ” signifies the time instant at which the 
instantaneous refrigerant mass flux is at the highest level and starts to decrease. The results 
indicate that for given q, G , ΔG/G  and tp the bubbles get bigger and become more crowded in 
the duct in the first half of the cycle in which the mass flux decreases. The opposite processes 
take place in the second half of the cycle in which the mass flux increases with time. These 
changes of the bubble characteristics with the instantaneous mass flux become more significant 
for an increase in the amplitude of the mass flux oscillation. Besides, the bubble coalescence 
occurs more frequently and more large bubbles appear in the duct for the cases with a longer 
period of the mass flux oscillation, as seen in Fig. 4.13. Then, the bubble behavior in the 
intermittent flow boiling for a case with a selected intermediate imposed heat flux is shown in 
Fig. 4.15. The results clearly indicate that initially in the beginning of the cycle the instantaneous 
mass flux decreases with time but is still well above G  no bubbles nucleate from the heated 
surface. The flow is in single-phase state. Note that the bubbles start to nucleate from the heated 
surface at a certain time instant slightly before t0+3tp/8 at which the instantaneous mass flux is 
somewhat below G.  Note that the number and size of the bubbles increase noticeably with time 
in the second quarter of the periodic cycle for the continuing decrease of the mass flux. Then in 
the third quarter of the periodic cycle the number and size of the bubbles diminish noticeably 
with time due to the increase of the mass flux. The bubbles cease to nucleate from the heated 
surface at a certain time instant slightly before t0+6tp/8 when the mass flux slightly exceeds G  
 46 
at a decreasing rate in the first half of the periodic cycle in which the refrigerant mass flux 
reduces with time (Fig. 4.17(a)). Apparently, in the second half of the cycle in which the 
refrigerant mass flux increases the bubble departing rate rises. Moreover, the data in Fig. 4.17(a) 
indicate that at the larger amplitude of the mass flux oscillation the bubble departure frequency 
exhibits a stronger variation with time and at a higher q the oscillation in f  is slightly stronger. 
Then, the results in Fig. 4.17(b) manifest that the bubble departure frequency is negligibly 
affected by the period of the mass flux oscillation. Obviously, reducing the duct gap causes a 
much larger variation of the bubble departure frequency with time (Fig. 4.19(b)). Finally, at 
higher G  and satT  the bubble departure frequency is in a stronger oscillation (Figs. 4.17(c) and 
(d)).  
 The time variations of the associated number density of the active nucleation sites affected 
by the mass flux oscillation presented in Fig. 4.18 clearly show that in the time periodic flow 
boiling the active nucleation site density also varies like a triangular wave. Besides, nac increases 
substantially with time in the first half of the periodic cycle in which the refrigerant mass flux 
decreases. The reverse process appears in the second half of the cycle in which the refrigerant 
mass flux rises. At the higher amplitude of the mass flux oscillation the temporal variation of nac 
is also stronger (Fig. 4.18(a)) and a higher imposed heat flux results in a slightly stronger 
oscillation in acn . But the effect of the period of the mass flux oscillation on the time variation 
of nac is small (Fig. 4.18(b)). But reducing the duct gap from 5.0 to 1.0 mm results in a much 
weaker time variation of nac (Fig. 4.19(c)). Finally, nac oscillates slightly stronger at a lower G  
and a higher satT  (Figs. 4.18(c) and (d)).  
 Based on the data in Figs. 4.16-4.18 for δ= 2.0 mm, the dependence of the quantitative 
bubble characteristics on the R-134a mass flux oscillation can be approximately expressed as 
-a
pd G∝ , bGf ∝  and -cacn G∝ , as shown in Fig. 4.20, when the short time lag in the Tw 
oscillation is neglected. Here the exponents a, b and c range respectively from 0.37 to 0.42 , 0.93 
to 0.99 , and 0.46 to 0.65. Note that the latent heat transfer resulting from bubble nucleation in 
the persistent boiling bq  is proportional to 
3
pd , f and acn , as discussed in the previous study 
[21, 22]. Thus, -dbq G∝ , here d varies from 0.58 to 0.98. This result clearly indicates that the 
flow boiling heat transfer gets better at decreasing refrigerant mass flux since bq  prevails in the 
boiling heat transfer. This in turn causes the heated wall temperature to decrease at decreasing 
refrigerant mass flux and vice versa in the time periodic flow boiling, as already seen from Fig. 
4.5. Besides, the dominant effect of the mass flux oscillation on the boiling heat transfer comes 
from the very strong influences of the mass flux on the bubble departure size.

CHAPTER 5 
Time Periodic Saturated Flow Boiling Heat Transfer of R-407C and 
Associated Bubble Characteristics in a Narrow Annular Duct due to Flow 
Rate Oscillation 
 
In a flow with an imposed temporal mass flux oscillation the refrigerant pressure at 
the duct inlet also varies with time, so does the refrigerant saturated temperature. In the 
first part of the present study the inlet temperature of the refrigerant is controlled at the 
time-average value of the instantaneous saturated temperature of the refrigerant at the duct 
inlet. Besides, the refrigerant quality at the inlet is set at zero. This is designated as
〝saturated flow boiling〞here. The mass flux oscillation is in the form of triangular waves. 
Results from the present measured heat transfer data and observed bubble characteristics 
for the saturated flow boiling of R-407C in the narrow annular duct affected by the 
imposed oscillating refrigerant mass flux, imposed heated flux, system pressure, and duct 
size are examined here. In this part of the experiment, results are obtained for the mean 
refrigerant mass flux G  varied from 100 to 600 kg/m2s and the amplitude of the mass 
flux oscillation /G GΔ  fixed at 10, 20, 30% of G  with the period of the mass flux 
oscillation tp fixed at 20, 60 and 120 seconds. The time-average refrigerant saturation 
temperature Tsat  is set at 10 and 15℃ for the imposed heat flux varied from 0 to 45 
kW/m2 . The gap between the inner and outer pipes δ is fixed at 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mm. The 
measured boiling heat transfer data are expressed in terms of the boiling curve and boiling 
heat transfer coefficient along with the time variations of the heated surface temperature. 
Besides, the close view flow photos taken at a small region around the middle axial station 
z =80 mm are presented to illustrate the bubble characteristics in the time periodic boiling 
flow. Then, comparison between the time periodic R-407C saturated flow boiling data due 
to the mass flux oscillation with that of stable boiling is conducted. Moreover, the 
quantitative bubble characteristics in the time periodic flow boiling will be examined. 
5.1 Single-phase Heat Transfer 
Before beginning the time periodic flow boiling experiments, the steady single-phase 
 74
increases gradually with the imposed heat flux from the time-average saturated 
temperature of the refrigerant to a certain value just slightly higher than satT  and no 
bubble nucleation is observed. The heat transfer in this region is completely due to the 
single-phase forced convection. With the continuing increase in the surface heat flux, 
bubbles begin to appear on the surface and the boiling curve is characterized by a sharp 
increase in the surface heat flux for a small rise in the temperature of the heated surface. 
We have onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) in the flow. The reason causing the sharp 
increase in the slope of the boiling curve is due to a significant increase in the surface heat 
transfer by the boiling processes when ONB occurs. For the cases with oscillating 
refrigerant mass fluxes the ONB locations marked in these plots are the time-average 
values. Note that beyond ONB the refrigerant mass flux has slight effects on the boiling 
curves, suggesting that the time-average surface heat transfer is mainly dominated by the 
fully developed nucleate boiling. Besides, at a higher G the required heat flux for ONB is 
higher and this implies that more energy is needed for the vapor to nucleate from the wall 
since the residence time of the refrigerant on the heated surface is shorter and the 
refrigerant is at a lower temperature. It can be concluded from the results in Figs. 5.2 - 5.7 
that the time-average boiling curves are not affected by the mean level, amplitude and 
period of the refrigerant mass flux oscillation and by the time-average refrigerant saturated 
temperature to a significant degree. 
We move further to explore how the sable and transient time-average saturated flow 
boiling heat transfer coefficients hr are affected by the R-407C mass flux oscillation. The 
results for the variations of the time-average hr with the imposed surface heat flux at the 
middle axial location presented in Figs. 5.8-5.13 reveal that the amplitudes and periods of 
the refrigerant mass flux oscillation have negligible influences on the time-average boiling 
heat transfer coefficients. However, for a given refrigerant mass flux the time-average 
boiling heat transfer coefficient increases substantially with the imposed heat flux. 
5.3 Time Periodic Flow Boiling Heat Transfer Characteristics 
The oscillatory saturated flow boiling heat transfer characteristics of R-407C in the 
annular duct resulting from the imposed temporal refrigerant mass flux oscillation are 
illustrated by presenting the time variations of the space-average heated surface 
temperature Tw and boiling heat transfer coefficient hr at the middle axial location. For the 
 76
boiling. For the imposed heat flux well below and well above the onset heat flux of stable 
flow boiling, apparently the flow is dominated respectively by the single-phase liquid and 
persistent boiling. The time instants for the start and stop of the bubble nucleation are 
marked on the curves for the cases with the intermittent boiling. 
The appearance of heated surface temperature decreases with mass flux increases in 
the persistent flow boiling needs to be examined. Based on the detailed flow observation, 
we note that at the imposed heat flux around that for the onset of stable flow boiling 
bubbles start to nucleate from the heated surface when the refrigerant mass flux is lowered 
to a certain level in the first half of the periodic cycle and more bubbles nucleate from the 
surface for a further reduction in the refrigerant mass flux. The results that heated surface 
temperature became lower. This trend is reversed when the mass flux increases in the 
second half of the periodic cycle. Specifically, at a certain high level of the mass flux the 
bubble nucleation reduces. Obviously, when the bubble nucleation reduces, the heated 
surface temperature rises with the mass flux increase. The above processes repeatedly 
occur forming the persistent flow boiling. 
The corresponding time variations of the space-average flow boiling heat transfer 
coefficient affected by the refrigerant mass flux oscillation are shown in Figs. 525 – 5.33. 
The results manifest that the flow boiling heat transfer coefficients also oscillate 
periodically in time and at the same frequency as the G oscillation. At a higher imposed 
heat flux and for a larger amplitude in the mass flux oscillation, the boiling heat transfer 
coefficients oscillate stronger. Besides in the first half of the periodic cycle at which the 
mass flux decreases with the time, the space-average heat transfer coefficient for the 
persistent boiling increases with time. The opposite processes occur in the second half of 
the periodic cycle. But for the cases with the single-phase flow hr decreases with time in 
the first half of the cycle in which G decreases with time. And the opposite is the case in 
the second half of the cycle. Moreover, the oscillation in hr also lags slightly behind the 
mass flux oscillation. 
Finally, we move further to present the data in Figs. 5.34 and 5.35 to elucidate the 
effects of the experimental parameters on the amplitude of Tw oscillation over a wide range 
of the imposed heat flux covering the single-phase, intermittent and persistent boiling flow 
regimes. The results in Figs. 5.34(a) and (b) indicate that for all boiling flow regimes the 
Tw oscillation is stronger for a higher amplitude and a longer period of the mass flux 
 78
region around the middle axial location of the duct for various refrigerant mass fluxes and 
imposed heat fluxes are shown in Figs. 5.37-5.54 for the time periodic saturated flow 
boiling. At first, the bubble characteristics for the limiting cases of constant mass fluxes are 
illustrated by the photos in Fig. 5.37. It is noted from the flow visualization and the results 
in Fig. 5.37 that the vapor bubbles begin to appear as the heated surface temperature 
exceeds the boiling incipient superheat. In the beginning, tiny bubbles are observed in the 
active nucleation sites. The bubbles grow and then detach from the heated surface with 
certain mean bubble departure diameter. As the imposed heat flux increases, more bubbles 
are generated on more active nucleation sites and more bubbles detach from the heated 
surface. Besides, the detached bubbles tend to merge into larger bubbles. Note that the 
large bubbles become distorted and elongated as they slide on the heating surface. 
Moreover, at a higher mass flux the bubbles are smaller and the bubble coalescence is less 
significant. Next, the bubble characteristics in the time dependent flow boiling are 
illustrated by presenting the photos of the boiling flow at eight selected time instants in a 
typical periodic cycle in Figs. 5.38–5.54. In these figures the symbol “ t=to ” signifies the 
time instant at which the instantaneous mass flux is at the highest level and starts to 
decrease with time. The results for the persistent flow boiling(Figs. 5.46-5.54)indicate that 
for a given imposed heat flux and fixed mean level, amplitude and period of the mass flux 
oscillation the bubbles get smaller and become more dispersed in the period of the time in  
which the instantaneous mass flux increases. The opposite processes take place when the 
instantaneous mass flux decreases with time. These changes of the bubble characteristics 
with the instantaneous mass flux become more significant for an increase in the amplitude 
of the mass flux oscillation.  
Then, the bubble behavior in the intermittent flow boiling for the intermediate 
imposed heat fluxes is shown in Figs. 5.38 – 5.45. The results clearly indicate that initially 
at small t the instantaneous mass flux decreases with time but is still well above G  no 
bubble nucleates from the heated surface. The flow is in single-phase state. Note that for 
the case shown in Fig. 5.38 the bubbles start to nucleate from the heated surface at a 
certain instant after t0+tp/8 at which the instantaneous mass flux already decreases a certain 
level. Note that the number and size of the bubbles increase noticeably with time in second 
quarter of the periodic cycle for the continuing decrease of the mass flux. Then in the third 
quarter of the periodic cycle the number and size of the bubbles diminish noticeably with 
time due to the increase of the mass flux with time. The bubbles cease to nucleate from the 
 80
bubble departure frequency with time. But increasing G and satT  mainly results in a 
higher mean level of the bubble departure frequency. 
Finally, the time variation of the space-average active nucleation site density on the 
heated surface affected by the mass flux oscillation is illustrated in Figs. 5.61 – 5.63. Note 
that in the time periodic flow boiling the active nucleation site density increases with time 
in the first half of the periodic cycle in which the mss flux decreases with time. The reverse 
process appears in the second half of the cycle in which the mass flux increases with time. 
At the higher amplitude of the mass flux oscillation the time variation of nac is stronger. 
The effects of the period of the mass flux oscillation on the time variation of nac are 
relatively small. Besides, a lower mean refrigerant mass flux and a higher mean refrigerant 
saturation temperature mainly cause higher mean level of nac. It is due to the lower surface 
tension for R-407C at a higher saturated temperature which in turn facilitates the bubble 
nucleation. But reducing the duct gap from 2.0 to 1.0 mm results in a much weaker time 
variation of nac (Fig. 5.63(a)). For δ reduced from the 5.0 to 2.0 mm the mean level of nac 
becomes much lower (Fig. 5.63(b)).   
Based on the present data, the dependence of the quantitative bubble characteristics 
on the mass flux oscillation can be approximately expressed as dp α G -a, f α G b and nac α 
G –c in Figs. 5.63&5.64. Here the exponents a, b and c range respectively from 0.22 to 0.27, 
0.355 to 0.41 and 0.84 to 0.96. Note that the latent heat transfer resulting from bubble 
nucleation in the persistent boiling qb is proportional to dp3, f and nac, as discussed in the 
previous study [14]. Thus, qb α G –d, here d varies from 1.145 to 1.36. This result clearly 
indicates that the flow boiling heat transfer gets better at decreasing refrigerant mass flux 
since qb prevails in the boiling heat transfer. Besides, the dominated effect of the mass flux 
oscillation on the boiling heat transfer comes from the very significant influence of the 
mass flux on the active nucleation site density. Note that qs=hl(Tw-Tsat). Hence it can be 
expressed as qs α G e in Fig. 4.65, here e varies from 0.97 to 1.03. We calculate qs and qb 
for qt=15kW/m2 and find qs/(qs+qb)=0.39. So qb has a very significant influence on the total 
boiling heat transfer.

for the flow velocity ranging from 13 cm/s to 400 cm/s. Their correlation is based on 
the experimental data procured from the same liquid and same flow configuration as 
the present data and the comparison is shown in Fig. 7.1 for the dimensional and 
dimensionless heat transfer coefficients. The results indicate that our data are in good 
agreements with their correlation.                                                         
It should be mentioned that all of the working fluid properties used in reducing the 
data for Fig. 7.1 from Equations 7.1 - 7.3 are calculated at the coolant inlet 
temperature. The copper plate diameter is chosen as the characteristic length in 
defining the Reynolds number LRe  and average Nusselt number LNu  because of 
its significant effect on the heat transfer performance [8]. 
 
7.2 Stable and Time-average Saturated Flow Boiling Curves and 
Heat Transfer Coefficient 
To illustrate the effects of the mass flux oscillation on the boiling characteristics, 
data for the FC-72 saturated flow boiling for a constant coolant mass flux are first 
compared with the time-average data for a transient oscillatory coolant mass flux. The 
 216
oscillation amplitude and period show negligible influences on the time-average flow 
boiling heat transfer coefficients. However, for a given coolant mass flux the boiling 
heat transfer coefficient increases substantially with the imposed heat flux. For 
example, at Tsat =55oC and G =400 kg/m2s, the saturated boiling heat transfer 
coefficient for q =9.7 W/cm2 is about 102% higher than that for q =3.2 W/cm2 (Figure 
7.4(a)). 
 
7.3 Transient Flow Boiling Heat Transfer Characteristics 
The transient boiling heat transfer characteristics for FC-72 flow over the heated 
copper plate resulting from the temporal coolant mass flux oscillation are illustrated 
by presenting the time variations of the space-average heated surface temperature Tw 
and heat transfer coefficient 2h φ  for various imposed heat fluxes and mass fluxes. 
For comparison purpose the results for Tw for the limiting cases of constant coolant 
mass fluxes are shown in Figure 4.6. These data indicate that the fluctuations of the 
average heated surface temperature with time for various q and G are relatively small. 
The boiling can be regarded as at a statistically stable state. 
Now when the coolant mass flux oscillates periodically in time in a form of 
nearly a triangular wave, significant temporal oscillations in the space average heated 
surface temperature occur for the imposed heat flux slightly higher than that for the 
time average ONB, as evident from the data shown in Figures 7.7 – 7.18 for the 
oscillation amplitude being 5% and 10% of the mean mass flux. Note that the 
temporal oscillation of the heated surface temperature is also periodic in time and is at 
the same frequency as the mass flux. Besides, the Tw oscillation gets stronger for 
higher imposed heat flux and higher amplitude of the mass flux oscillation. However, 
the period of the mass flux oscillation only slightly affects the Tw oscillation. It is of 
 218
2h φ  also lags slightly behind the mass flux oscillation. 
In this transient oscillatory boiling flow the time variation of the coolant pressure 
at the inlet of the test section is also of interest in thermal-fluid design. These data are 
shown in Figures 7.31 – 7.42 for various cases. The results indicate that the inlet 
coolant pressure oscillates nearly in phase with the mass flux oscillation. Note that the 
inlet coolant pressure oscillation becomes somewhat irregular for the larger amplitude 
of the mass flux oscillation and a higher average mass flux (Figures 7.36, 7.38, 7.40 
and 7.42). Finally, the quantitative data evaluated from the above results are 
summarized in Table 7.1 for the relative oscillation amplitudes of the space average 
heated surface temperature and boiling heat transfer coefficient 
wT sat
ΔA / T and 
h2φ 2φA /h at various imposed heat fluxes and the amplitude and period of the coolant 
mass flux oscillation. 
 
7.4 Transient Bubble Characteristics in Saturated Flow Boiling 
To elucidate the transient saturated flow boiling heat transfer characteristics, the 
data for the bubble characteristics of FC-72 obtained from the present flow 
visualization are examined in the following. The top views of the boiling flow in a 
small region around the geometric center of the heated surface for various coolant 
mass fluxes and imposed heat fluxes are shown in Figs. 7.43 - 7.67 for the transient 
saturated flow boiling. At first, the bubble characteristics for the limiting cases of 
constant mass fluxes are illustrated by the photos in Figure 7.43. It is noted in the flow 
visualization and the results in Figure 7.43 that the vapor bubbles begin to appear as 
the heated surface temperature exceeds the boiling incipient superheat. In the 
beginning, tiny bubbles are observed in the active nucleation sites. The bubbles grow 
and then detach from the heated surface with certain mean bubble departure diameters. 
 220
site density in a typical periodic cycle are given in Figs. 4.68 – 4.94 for various mean 
coolant mass fluxes, amplitudes and periods of the coolant mass flux oscillations, and 
imposed heat fluxes. 
The results in Fig. 4.68(a) indicate that the mean size of the bubbles departing 
from the copper plate is somewhat smaller for the mass flux raised from 300 to 400 
kg/m2s in the stable flow boiling. It reflects the fact that the coolant at a higher mass 
flux and hence at a higher speed tends to sweep the bubbles more quickly away from 
the heating surface. Now as the coolant mass flux oscillates, the bubble departure 
diameter varies significantly with time (Figures 4.68(b) - (c)). More specifically, the 
size of the departing bubbles decreases in the first and fourth quarters of the periodic 
cycle in which the instantaneous mass flux increases with time. While in the second 
and third quarters of the cycle an opposite process is noted since the instantaneous 
mass flux decreases with time. Besides, at a higher imposed heat flux the departing 
bubbles are larger. Similar trend is noted in Figures 4.69 – 4.71. Comparing the results 
in Figure 4.68 with Figure 4.69 and Figure 4.70 with Figure 4.71 indicates that at the 
larger amplitude of the mass flux oscillation the effects of the imposed heat flux on 
the bubble departure diameter are somewhat smaller. The results in Figures 4.72 – 
4.75 indicate that the bubble departure diameters are only affected slightly by the 
period of the mass flux oscillation. 
Next, the data for the variations of the space-average bubble departure frequency 
with time for various cases are shown in Figures 4.77 – 4.80. In the stable flow 
boiling the increase in the bubble departure frequency with the imposed heat flux and 
coolant mass flux is clearly seen. The increase of f with G is ascribed again to the 
higher drag on the bubbles still attaching to the heated surface by the liquid coolant 
moving at a higher speed for a higher G. This, in turn, causes an earlier departure of 
the bubbles from the surface, resulting in a higher departure frequency. For an 
 222

experimental data fall within ± 20 % of the correlations given in Equations (4.4) and 
(4.7). In addition, empirical equations are provided to correlate the data for the

CHAPTER 8 
Time Periodic Saturated Flow Boiling Heat Transfer of R-134a and Associated 
Bubble Characteristics in a Narrow Annular Duct due to Heat Flux 
Oscillation 
 
 
 The results obtained for the R-134a saturated flow boiling resulting from the imposed heat 
flux oscillation only are presented in this chapter. The present time periodic R-134a saturated 
flow boiling experiment is performed for the refrigerant mass flux G varying from 100 to 600 
kg/m2s, mean imposed heat flux q  from 0 to 45 kW/m2, and system pressure P set at 414.6 kPa 
and 488.6 kPa ( corresponding to the R-134a saturation temperature satT =10℃ and 15℃) for 
the gap of the duct δ= 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mm. Besides, the amplitude of the imposed heat flux 
oscillation qΔ  is set at 0, 10, 30 and 50% of q . Moreover, the period of the heat flux 
oscillation pt  is fixed at 20, 30, 60 and 120 seconds. The ranges of the parameters chosen above 
are in accordance with some air-conditioning applications. Several time scales associated with 
the present saturated flow boiling over the heated inner pipe surface are given in Table 6.1. 
Specifically, there are four relevant time scales in the experiment. The conduction time scale 1t  
is estimated by considering a copper slab of the characteristic length cL  (thickness) subject to a 
step heat input at one of its surface at certain time instant and 1t  is the duration for the other 
surface to begin to feel the heat input [86]. According the thermal diffusion speed, 21 c wt L /α≈ . 
The convection time scale 2t  can be estimated by the equation 2 lt =L/(G/ρ )  [87]. The time 
scale for the bubble growth or departure 3t  is approximated by the empirical expression 
p
3
l l h
d
t =
2000(μ /(ρ D ))
 [88]. Finally, the time constant of the present flow boiling on the heated 
copper duct surface ct  is obtained by meauring Tw subject to a step input in the imposed heat 
flux for both single-phase and boiling conditions. The results in Tables 6.1-6.3 clearly indicate 
that the time constants associated with the single-phase liquid flow and flow boiling over the 
heat surface are much larger than the other time constants and hence dominate the time response 
of the duct wall to the heat flux oscillation. Besides, the time lag of the heated surface 
temperature behind the imposed heat flux oscillation is expected to be significant. In the 
following, attention will be mainly paid to examining the effects of the amplitude and period of 
the heat flux oscillation on the time periodic R-134a saturated flow boiling heat transfer 
 336
q . For clear illustration, the measured data for the time variations of the actual imposed heat flux 
are also given here. The results manifest that when q oscillates periodically in time nearly like a 
triangular wave, significant temporal oscillations in Tw and hr nearly in the form of sinusoidal 
waves can occur. Note that the Tw and hr oscillations are also periodic in time and are at the same 
frequency as the heat flux. Besides, the Tw and hr oscillations get stronger for a higher amplitude 
and a longer period of the imposed heat flux oscillation. Moreover, the Tw oscillation is stronger 
for a higher mean imposed heat flux. Note that single-phase forced convection prevails in the 
duct at a relatively low imposed heat flux. The data given in Figs. 8.3 - 8.6 further reveals that 
the Tw oscillation significantly lags the heat flux oscillation for both single-phase and boiling 
flows. This time lag apparently results from the thermal inertia of the heated pipe wall. Note that 
for given G, satT , and Δq/q  the duration of the time lag relative to the oscillation period l pt /t  
is slightly longer at a lower time-average imposed heat flux and a shorter period of the imposed 
heat oscillation. Furthermore, for the single-phase convection at low q and in the first half of the 
periodic cycle in which the heat flux decreases with time, after the time lag the wall temperature 
is found to decrease with time. The opposite process occurs in the second half of the cycle. It is 
further noted in the experiment that at a low q  the temperature of the heating surface is lower 
than that required for the onset of nucleate boiling and no bubble nucleates from the heating 
surface in the whole periodic cycle. Hence heat transfer in the flow results completely from the 
single-phase forced convection. As the mean imposed wall heat flux is raised gradually, the 
heated surface temperature increases correspondingly. The corresponding Tw oscillation 
amplitude can be significant even when the single-phase flow prevails in the duct (Fig. 8.3(c)). 
At a certain higher wall temperature for a small increase in q  bubbles start to nucleate from the 
heated surface at certain instant of time but bubble nucleation is not seen in the whole cycle. 
Thus, we have intermittent boiling in the flow in which nucleate boiling only exists in a partial 
duration of the periodic cycle. The time instants for the start and termination of the nucleate 
boiling are marked on the curves for Tw for the cases with the presence of the intermittent boiling. 
For some increase in the mean imposed heat flux nucleate boiling persists over the entire period 
of the cycle and we have persistent flow boiling in the duct. The results in Figs. 8.3 - 8.6 also 
show that after the time lag Tw and hr both decrease with time in the first half of the periodic 
cycle in which the imposed heat flux decreases with time. While in the second half of the cycle 
the opposite process occurs. Then, the data shown in Fig. 8.5 indicate that the Tw oscillation 
amplitude increases noticeably with an increase in the channel gap in the persistent flow boiling.  
8.3 Intermittent Flow Boiling  
 It is of interest to note in the visualization of the boiling flow in the annular duct that over a 
certain intermediate range of the mean imposed heat flux the intermittent boiling appears. More

constant of the flow boiling system.  
 On the other hand, when the oscillatory period is relatively long at 120 and 600 seconds, the 
data given in Figs. 8.9(b) and (c) manifest that the amplitude of the Tw oscillation is very large. 
Note that the Tw oscillation is slightly stronger for tp raised from 120 to 600 seconds. The 
stronger Tw oscillation at a longer tp can be attributed to the longer period of time for the thermal 
energy storing in and releasing from the wall of the heated inner pipe. This in turn causes the 
heated pipe wall to accumulate thermal energy over a longer period of time and hence results in a 
larger amplitude of the Tw oscillation.  
8.5 Effect of Heat Flux Oscillation Amplitude  
 Then the effect of the amplitude of the heat flux oscillation on the time periodic flow 
boiling is examined. The data presented in Fig. 8.10 for five different amplitudes of the imposed 
heat flux oscillation withΔq/q  = 10, 30, 50, 80 and 100% at tp =120 seconds show that the Tw 
oscillation is significantly stronger for a larger amplitude of the imposed heat flux oscillation. 
Note that the time lag in Tw oscillation increases substantially when the amplitude of the 
imposed heat flux oscillation is raised from 10% to 30%. But a further increase in the amplitude 
of the heat flux oscillation does not increase the time lag noticeably.  
8.6 Bubble Characteristics in Time Periodic Flow Boiling  
 The bubble characteristics associated with the stable saturated flow boiling of R-134a in the 
present narrow annular duct have been examined in our recent study [21]. These characteristics 
indicate that for the constant imposed heat flux exceeding that for onset of nucleate boiling the 
duct is dominated by the persistent boiling and a number of discrete bubbles nucleate from the 
cavities and slide along the heating surface. At a higher q the active bubble nucleation density 
increases and a lot of coalescence bubbles appear. More coalescence bubbles are seen and they 
are confined by the duct walls to become slightly deformed for a further increase in q. At even 
higher q the duct is mainly filled with the coalescence bubbles. They also reported that at a 
higher refrigerant mass flux the bubble departure frequency was higher and the bubbles were 
smaller and in violent agitating motion. However, the active nucleation site density is lower at a 
higher mass flux. But at the lower mass flux the bubble coalescence is more important and a 
number of bigger bubbles form in the duct. Then, at a lower saturation temperature of the 
refrigerant the bubbles were found to grow bigger and depart at a lower rate, and the active 
nucleation site density is lower due to the higher surface tension and enthalpy of vaporization. 
 By and large, in the time periodic flow boiling investigated here the effects of the mean 
imposed heat flux and refrigerant mass flux and saturation temperature on the bubble behavior 
exhibit similar trends to that in the stable flow boiling. Hence, we first illustrate here how the 
 340
imposed heat flux is at the highest level and starts to decrease in a typical periodic cycle. The 
data in Fig. 8.14 indicate that as the imposed heat flux oscillates time periodically, the bubble 
departure diameter also varies time periodically and to some degree like a triangular wave as the 
imposed heat flux oscillation. Note that the effect of the time lag in Tw oscillation is clearly seen. 
More specifically, the size of the departing bubbles does not decrease immediately with time in 
the first half of the periodic cycle in which the heat flux decreases with time. In fact, the bubble 
size increases in the initial transient for lt<t  and then for t exceeding the time lag the departing 
bubbles decrease in size. While in the second half of the cycle an opposite process is noted when 
the heat flux increases with time. The above time variation of the bubble departure diameter 
resmbles the Tw oscillation presented in Fig. 8.3. Besides, the results in Fig. 8.14(a) show that at 
the larger amplitude of the heat flux oscillation the time variation of the bubble departure 
diameter is somewhat stronger. Moreover, the results in Fig. 8.14(b) indicate that to some degree 
the bubble departure diameter varies stronger with time for a longer period of the heat flux 
oscillation. Furthermore, increases in the refrigerant mass flux, saturation temperature and duct 
gap and a decrease in the mean imposed heat flux cause the departing bubbles to become smaller 
but do not change the wave form of the dp variation with time (Figs. 8.14(a), (c), (d) and 8.17(a)). 
It is worth mentioning that in the present study even the size of the largest departing bubble is 
below 0.25 mm which is much smaller than the diameter of the outer glass pipe in the test 
section (Dp= 20.0 mm). Thus the observation of the bubble size through the curved surface of the 
glass pipe is not expected to produce significant error.  
 How the temporal variation of the bubble departure frequency is affected by the heat flux 
oscillation is shown in Fig. 8.15. Note that the bubble departure frequency also varies like a 
triangular wave. Besides, for an oscillation heat flux after the time lag for lt>t  the bubbles 
depart from the heated surface at a decreasing rate in the first half of the periodic cycle in which 
the heat flux and heated surface temperature decrease with time (Fig. 8.15(a)). Note that in the 
initial stage for lt<t  the bubble departure frequency increases with time as Tw. Apparently, in 
the second half of the cycle in which the heat flux increases the opposite process takes place. 
Moreover, the results in Fig. 8.15(a) indicate that at the larger amplitude of the heat flux 
oscillation the bubble departure frequency exhibits a stronger variation with time. Then, the 
results in Fig. 8.15(b) indicate that the bubble departure frequency oscillates in a larger 
amplitude at a longer period of the heat flux oscillation. Obviously, reducing the duct gap causes 
a larger variation of the bubble departure frequency with time (Fig. 8.17(b)). Finally, at higher q , 
G and satT  and at a smaller δ the bubble departure frequency is higher (Figs. 8.15(a), (c) and 
(d) and 8.17(b)).  
 342
results obtained here can be summarized in the following.  
(1) The time-average boiling curves and heat transfer coefficients for the time periodic flow 
boiling of R-134a are not affected to a noticeable degree by the amplitude and period of the 
imposed heat flux oscillation.  
(2) The heated pipe wall temperature, bubble departure diameter and frequency, and active 
nucleation site density also oscillate periodically in time and at the same frequency as the 
heat flux oscillation. Experiments also show that the resulting oscillation amplitudes of the 
heated surface temperature, heat transfer coefficient and bubble parameters, such as dp, f 
and nac, get larger for a longer period and a larger amplitude of the imposed heat flux 
oscillation and for a higher mean imposed heat flux. Moreover, a significant time lag in the 
heated surface temperature oscillation is also noted, which apparently results from the 
thermal inertia of the copper inner pipe. The nondimensional time lag, defined as the ratio 
of the time lag to the period of the imposed heat flux oscillation, is longer at a lower mean 
imposed heat flux and a shorter period and for a larger amplitude of the imposed heat flux 
oscillation when the amplitude is below 30%. Furthermore, the bubbles become smaller and 
more dispersed after the time lag when the imposed heat flux decreases with time. The 
opposite processes take place at increasing heat flux. Finally, reductions in the size of the 
departing bubbles, the bubble departure frequency and active nucleation site density with 
time result in the time duration in which the heat flux is sinking. When the heat flux is 
rising the opposite processes occur.  
(3) The effects of heat flux oscillation at extremely short and long periods have been explored. 
Due to the existence of the thermal inertia of the heated copper duct, the resulting heated 
surface temperature does not oscillate with time at an extremely short period of the imposed 
heat flux oscillation. But the oscillation amplitude of the heated surface temperature gets 
noticeably stronger for an extremely long period of the imposed heat flux oscillation.  
(4) When the imposed heat flux over the heated surface is close to the heat flux corresponding 
to that for the onset of stable flow boiling, intermittent flow boiling appears. A flow regime 
map and an empirical correlation are given to delineate the boundaries separating different 
boiling flow regimes in the annular duct.

CHAPTER 9 
TIME PERIODIC SATURATED FLOW BOILING OF R-410A IN A 
NARROW ANNULAR DUCT DUE TO HEAT FLUX OSCILLATION 
 
The results obtained in the second part of the present study for the time periodic 
saturated flow boiling of R-410A in the duct due to the imposed heat flux oscillation are 
examined in this chapter. The present experiments are conducted for the refrigerant mass 
flux G varied from 300 to 500 kg/m2s, mean imposed heat flux  from 0 to 45 kW/m2, 
and the amplitude of the heat flux oscillation  fixed at 10, 30, 50% of  with the 
period of the heat flux oscillation tp fixed at 20, 60 and 120 seconds. The refrigerant 
saturation temperature Tsat is set at 5, 10 and 15℃. The gap between the inner and outer 
pipes δ is fixed at 2.0 mm. Several time scales associated with the present saturated flow 
boiling over the heated inner pipe surface are given in Table 5.1. Specifically, there are four 
relevant time scales in the experiment. The conduction time scale t1 is estimated by 
considering a copper slab of the characteristic length Lc (thickness) subject to a step heat 
input at one of its surface at certain time instant and t1 is the duration for the other surface 
to begin to feel the heat input. According the thermal diffusion speed, t1≈Lc2/αw. The 
convection time scale t2 can be estimated by the equation t2 = L/(G/ρ1). The time scale for 
the bubble growth or departure t3 is approximated by the empirical expression 
. Finally, the time constant of the present flow boiling on the heated 
copper duct surface tc is obtained by measuring Tw subject to a step input in the imposed 
heat flux for both single-phase and boiling conditions. The results in Table 5.1 for various 
time constants for selected cases clearly indicate that the values of tc associated with the 
single-phase liquid flow and flow boiling over the heated surface are much larger than the 
other time constants and dominate the time response of the duct wall to the heat flux 
oscillation. Besides, the time lag of the heated surface temperature behind the imposed heat 
flux oscillation is expected to be significant. In the following, attention will be mainly paid 
to examining the effects of the amplitude and period of the heat flux oscillation on the time 
periodic R-410A saturated flow boiling heat transfer performance. Note that for the 
 366
both single-phase and boiling flows. The time lag apparently results from the thermal 
inertia of the heated pipe wall. Note that for given G, Tsat, and  the duration of time 
lag relative to the oscillation period t1/tp is slightly longer at a lower time-average imposed 
heat flux and a shorter period of the imposed heat flux. Furthermore, the heat flux 
decreases with time in the first half of the periodic cycle for the single-phase convection, 
after the time lag the heating wall temperature is found to decrease with time. The opposite 
process occurs in the second half of the cycle. It is noted that at low mean imposed heat 
flux no bubble nucleates from the heating surface in the whole periodic cycle. Hence heat 
transfer in the flow results completely from the single-phase forced convection. As the 
mean imposed wall heat flux is raised gradually, the heating surface temperature increases 
correspondingly and the corresponding Tw oscillation amplitude can be significant. At a 
certain higher  bubbles start to nucleate from the heating surface at certain instant of 
time but bubble nucleation is not seen in the whole cycle. Thus, we have intermittent 
boiling in the flow in which nucleate boiling only exists in a partial duration of the periodic 
cycle. The time instants for the start and termination of the nucleate boiling are marked on 
the curves for Tw for the cases with the presence of the intermittent boiling. Moreover, for a 
much higher  nucleate boiling persists over the entire period of the cycle and we have 
persistent flow boiling in the duct. Note that after the time lag, Tw and hr both decrease 
with time in the first half of the periodic cycle in which the imposed heat flux decreases 
with time for the single-phase flow, intermittent flow boiling and persistent flow boiling. 
The results in Figs. 9.10 and 9.11 also show that at a higher refrigerant saturated 
temperature, the amplitude of the Tw oscillation is larger in persistent flow boiling. This is 
because of the surface tension of R-410A is smaller at higher refrigerant saturated 
temperature, so more bubbles nucleate at the heating surface. 
9.3 Intermittent Boiling 
It is of interest to note in the visualization of the boiling flow over the heated inner 
pipe in the annular duct that over a certain intermediate range of the mean imposed heat 
flux the intermittent boiling appears, as already mentioned earlier. More specifically, in a 
typical periodic cycle of the imposed heat flux oscillation bubble nucleation in the heated 
annular duct disappears at a certain time instant after the heat flux decreases to a certain 
low level and the pipe wall temperature decreases to the level below that required for the 
 368
seconds, the data given in Figs. 9.23 & 9.24 manifest that the amplitude of the Tw 
oscillation is very large. Note that the Tw oscillation is slightly stronger for tp raised from 
120 to 600 seconds. The stronger Tw oscillation at a longer tp can be attributed to the longer 
period of time for the thermal energy storing in and releasing from the wall of the heated 
inner pipe. This in turn causes the heat pipe wall to accumulate and release thermal energy 
over a longer period of time and hence results in a larger amplitude of the Tw oscillation. 
9.5 Effect of Heat Flux Oscillation Amplitude 
The effect of the amplitude of the heat flux oscillation on the time periodic flow 
boiling of R-410A is examined further, too. The results in Fig. 9.25 for three different 
amplitudes of the imposed heat flux oscillation with  = 10, 30 and 50% at tp = 60 
seconds show that the Tw oscillation is significantly stronger for a larger amplitude of the 
imposed heat flux oscillation. Note that the time lag in Tw oscillation increases 
substantially when the amplitude of the imposed heat flux oscillation is raised from 10% to 
30%. But a further increase in the amplitude of the heat flux oscillation does not increase 
the time lag noticeably. 
9.6 Time Periodic Bubble Characteristics in Saturated Flow Boiling 
To elucidate the time periodic saturated flow boiling heat transfer characteristics 
resulting from the imposed heat flux oscillation, the data for the bubble characteristics of 
R-410A flow boiling obtained from the present flow visualization are examined in the 
following. The side views of the boiling flow in a small region around the middle axial 
location of the duct for various imposed heat fluxes are shown in Figs. 9.26-9.43 for 
selected cases for the time periodic saturated flow boiling. In these figures the symbol
〝 t=to 〞signifies the time instant at which the instantaneous heat flux is at the highest 
level and starts to decrease with time. The bubble behavior in the intermittent flow boiling 
for the cases with given intermediate imposed heat fluxes is manifested in Figs. 9.26-9.34. 
The results clearly indicates that initially in the beginning of the cycle the instantaneous 
heat flux decreases with time but is still well above , bubbles nucleation from the 
heated surface is clearly seen. Note that the number and size of the bubbles decrease 
noticeably with time in the first quarter of the periodic cycle for the continuing decrease of 
 370
also varies time periodically and to some degree like a triangular wave as the imposed heat 
flux oscillation. Note that the effect of the time lag on the Tw oscillation is clearly seen. 
More specifically, the size of the departing bubbles does not decrease immediately with 
time in the first half of the periodic cycle in which the heat flux decreases with time. In fact, 
the bubble size increases in the initial transient for t < tl and then for t > tl the bubble 
departure diameter decreases. While in the second half of the cycle an opposite process is 
noted when heat flux increases with time. The results in Fig. 9.44(a) show that at the larger 
amplitude of the heat flux oscillation and mean imposed head flux the time variation of 
bubble departure diameter is somewhat stronger. Moreover, the results in Fig. 9.44(b) 
indicate that to some degree the bubble departure diameter varies stronger with time for a 
longer period of the heat flux oscillation. Furthermore, the results in Figs. 9.45(a) and (b) 
show that increases in the refrigerant mass flux and saturated temperature cause the 
departing bubbles to become smaller but do not change the wave form of the dp variation 
with time.  
How the temporal variation of the bubble departure frequency is affected by the heat 
flux oscillation is shown in Figs. 9.46 and 9.47. Note that the bubble frequency also varies 
like a triangular wave. At first, for t < t1 the bubble departure frequency increases with time. 
Then, for an oscillation heat flux after the time lag for t > t1 the bubbles depart from the 
heated surface at a decreasing rate in the first half of the periodic cycle in which the heat 
flux decreases with time (Fig. 9.46(a)). Apparently, in the second half of the cycle in which 
the heat flux increases the opposite process takes place. Moreover, the results in Fig. 9.46(a) 
indicate that at the larger amplitude of the heat flux oscillation and mean imposed heat flux 
the bubble departure frequency exhibits a stronger variation with time. Then, the results in 
Fig. 9.46(b) indicate that the bubble departure frequency oscillates in a larger amplitude at 
a longer period of the heat flux oscillation. Finally, at higher G and Tsat the bubble 
departure frequency is higher (Figs. 9.47(a) and (b)).  
The data given in Figs 9.48 and 9.49 show the time variations of the associated 
number density of the active nucleation sites on the heating surface affected by the heat 
flux oscillation. The results clearly indicate that in the time periodic flow boiling the active 
nucleation site density also varies like a triangular wave. Besides, nac decreases 
substantially with time after the time lag for t > t1 in the first half of the periodic cycle in 
which the heat flux decreases with time. The reverse process appears in the second half of

CHAPTER 11 
TRANSIENT OSCILLATORY SATURATED FLOW BOILING OF 
FC-72 OVER A SMALL HEATED COPPER PLATE 
The experimental results obtained in the first part of this study are presented here to 
illustrate how the imposed heat flux oscillation in the form of rectangular waves affects 
the transient oscillatory saturated flow boiling heat transfer of FC-72 over the small heated 
circular copper flat plate flush mounted on the bottom of a horizontal rectangular channel. 
The present experiments are carried out for the FC-72 mass flux G fixed at 300 and 400 
kg/m2s for the time-average imposed heat flux q  varied from 0.1 2W/cm  to 10 W/cm2. 
Besides, the amplitude of the heat flux oscillation △q is set at 10%, 30% and 50% of the 
average heat flux. In addition, the period of the heat flux oscillation tp is fixed at 10, 20 
and 30 seconds. The coolant FC-72 in the test section is at a slightly subatmospheric 
pressure of 99KPa with Tsat=55 o C . In the following , the effects of the experimental 
parameters including G, q , △q/ q  and tp on the transient FC-72 saturated flow boiling 
heat transfer performance will be examined in detail. The heat transfer performance is 
presented mainly in terms of the time variations of the space-average surface temperature 
of the copper plate and the space-average boiling heat transfer coefficient. The conduction 
time scale t1 is estimated by considering a slab of the characteristic length Lc (thickness) 
subject to a constant heat input at one of its surface at certain time instant and t1 is the 
duration for the other surface to begin to feel the heat input. According the thermal 
diffusion speed, t1 2c wL /α≈ . The time scale for bubble growth or departure is t2 which can 
be approximated by l v

. Finally, the time constant of the present boiling on the 
copper surface tc is obtained by measuring Tw for both single-phase and boiling conditions. 
The results are shown in Figs. 11.135 for a step increase in the imposed heat flux and 
 491
11.2 Stable and Time-average Saturated Flow Boiling Curves and Heat 
Transfer Coefficient 
It is of interest to compare the time-average data deduced from the present transient 
flow boiling heat transfer measurement with that from the stable flow boiling in which the 
imposed heat flux does not vary with time. The results from this comparison are shown in 
Figs. 11.2 - 11.6 by presenting the boiling curves for various G, △q/ q  and tp. Note that 
for each stable boiling curve at a given coolant mass flux the mean temperature of the 
copper plate increases with the imposed heat flux. When the imposed heat flux is 
increased gradually to a certain value, the temperature of the copper plate is slightly higher 
than Tsat but no bubble nucleation on the heated copper plate is observed. Heat transfer in 
the flow completely results from single-phase forced convection. A continuing increase of 
the heat flux to a certain higher value, the boiling curve is characterized by a sharp 
increase in the surface heat flux for a small rise in the temperature of the copper surface 
when the bubbles begin to appear on the copper surface. We define this phenomenon as 
onset of nucleate boiling (ONB). The reason causing the sharp increase in the slope of the 
boiling curve is due to a significant increase in the surface heat transfer by the boiling 
processes when ONB occurs. It is also noted from the stable and time-average boiling 
curves that beyond ONB the coolant mass flux only has slight effects on the boiling curves, 
suggesting that the surface heat transfer is mainly dominated by the fully developed 
nucleate boiling. Besides, at a higher G the required heat flux for ONB is higher and this 
implies that more energy is needed for the vapor to nucleate from the heated plate since 
the residence time of the coolant on the heated surface is shorter. The results also suggest 
that the time-average boiling curves are not noticeably affected by the amplitude and 
period of the heat flux oscillation. A close inspection of the boiling curves, however, 
reveals that for the time varying imposed heat flux a slightly higher ONBq is required to 
 493
same △q/ q  for a short tp of 10 and 20 seconds. However, at a longer tp of 30 seconds the 
amplitude of the heated surface temperature oscillation varies non monotonically with the 
mean imposed heat flux(Figs. 11.19-11.21). Moreover, the heated surface temperature 
oscillates in a larger amplitude for a larger △q/ q  and/or a longer tp. It should be 
mentioned here that even for the single-phase forced convection with q < O N Bq  the 
heated surface temperature exhibits some temporal oscillation. A close inspection of the 
data shown in Figs. 11.13-11.21 further reveals that the temporal increase of Tw following 
the step rise in the imposed heat flux experiences some delay. And the delay is slightly 
longer for a lower mean imposed heat flux, suggesting the response of the heated plate 
temperature to a step change in q is faster at a higher q . Similar time delay in the Tw 
oscillation is also found for a step decrease in q. This time delay in Tw obviously results 
from the thermal inertia of the heated copper plate. Besides, the time lag in the Tw 
oscillation is shorter for a longer tp. Similar trend is noted from the data shown in Figs. 
11.22-11.30 for a higher G of 400 kg/m2s. Finally, the quantitative data evaluated from the 
above results are summarized in Tables 11.1 and 11.2 for the oscillation amplitudes of the 
space-average heated surface temperature and the relative time lag of Tw for various cases 
tested here. 
The corresponding time variations of the space-average flow boiling heat transfer 
coefficient affected by the imposed heat flux oscillation are also shown in Figs. 
11.13–11.30. The results manifest that the flow boiling heat transfer coefficients also 
oscillate periodically in time and is at the same frequency as the q oscillation. At a higher 
mean imposed heat flux and for a larger amplitude of the imposed heat flux oscillation, the 
boiling heat transfer coefficient oscillates stronger. 
11.4 Intermittent Boiling 
It is of interest to note in the visualization of the boiling flow over the heated copper 
 495
oscillation (Tables 11.1 and 11.2). Is it possible that the plate is not able to respond to a 
fast heat flux oscillation at very small tp and we have a stable boiling on the plate? This 
possibility is tested here by reducing tp to 4 seconds, which is the shortest tp we can attain 
in the present experimental facility. The data from this test are shown in Figs. 11.31 and 
11.32. These results do indicate that even at a very high imposed heat flux with 
q =6.08W/cm2 and a large △q/ q  of 50% the oscillation amplitude of Tw is only about 
0.26oC at tp=4 seconds(Fig. 11.31(a)). This small amplitude of the Tw oscillation is very 
close to the background thermal disturbances and the boiling approaches that at steady 
state. For the lower △q/ q  of 10% and 30% the boiling is essentially at steady state for 
tp= 4 seconds. 
Then, the time response of the copper plate subject to a very slow heat flux 
oscillation is explored. The measured data for the temporal variations of the space-average 
heated surface temperature for selected cases with tp=60, 120 and 180 seconds are shown 
in Figs. 11.33 and 11.34. The results for tp=180 seconds indicate that for the cases with 
high q  and low △q/ q  the heated plate temperature at either half cycle of high heat flux 
level at q +△q or low heat flux level at q -△q gradually levels off and nearly 
approaches a steady state value corresponding to the heat flux at that half cycle. Besides, 
the nearly stable Tw is also very close to that in stable boiling shown in Fig. 11.2. 
11.6 Bubble Characteristics 
To elucidate the above transient saturated flow boiling heat transfer characteristics, 
the data for the bubble characteristics of FC-72 obtained from the present flow 
visualization are examined in the following. The photos taken from the top view of the 
boiling flow in a small region around the geometric center of the heated surface for 
various coolant mass fluxes and imposed heat fluxes are shown in Figs. 11.35 - 11.89 for 
the transient saturated flow boiling. At first, the bubble characteristics for the limiting 
 497
The photos of the boiling flow for the cases with the mean imposed heat flux well 
above the heat flux at the ONB for the transient saturated boiling are presented in Figs. 
11.54 – 11.89. At these higher q  we have persistent boiling in the flow. The results 
indicate that in the first half of the periodic cycle with the imposed heat flux at the low 
level of   q-△q, the bubble population decreases with time and the bubbles are smaller. 
The opposite is the case in the second half of the cycle with the imposed heat flux at the 
high level of q+△q. A number of big bubbles are seen in these photos. They are formed 
from the merging of small bubbles. These changes in the bubble characteristics are more 
significant at a higher amplitude of the heat flux oscillation and at a higher mean imposed 
heat flux. 
To quantify the bubble characteristics, the measured data for the time variations of 
the space-average bubble departure diameter and frequency and active nucleation site 
density in a typical periodic cycle are given in Figs. 11.90 – 11.134 for various coolant 
mass fluxes, amplitudes and periods of the imposed heat flux oscillations, and mean 
imposed heat fluxes. 
The results in Fig. 11.90(a) for △q=0 indicate that the mean size of the bubbles 
departing from the copper plate is somewhat smaller for the mass flux raised from 300 to 
400 kg/m2s in the stable flow boiling. It reflects the fact that the coolant at a higher mass 
flux and hence at a higher speed tends to sweep the bubbles more quickly away from the 
heating surface. Now as the imposed heat flux oscillation is at a low amplitude of 10%, 
the bubble departure diameter varies slightly with time (Figs. 11.90(b) – (d)). More 
specifically, the size of the departing bubbles decreases in the first half of the periodic 
cycle in which the heat flux is at the low level of q -△q. While in the second half of the 
cycle an opposite process is noted since the imposed heat flux is maintained at the high 
level of q +△q. Besides, at a higher imposed heat flux the departing bubbles are larger. 
 499
density increases substantially with the imposed heat flux. But the increase is rather mild 
for the mass flux reduced from 400 to 300 kg/m2s. Note that in the transient flow boiling 
the active nucleation site density decreases with time in the first half of the periodic cycle 
in which the imposed heat flux is at the low level. The reverse process appears in the 
second half of the cycle in which the heat flux is at the high level. At a longer period and a 
higher amplitude of the heat flux oscillation and at a higher mean imposed heat flux the 
temporal variations of Nac is stronger. Besides, at a lower coolant mass flux the time 
variations of Nac is slightly larger. A boiling regime map to delineate various states of the 
present transient saturated flow boiling is shown in Fig. 11.136. 
11.7 Correlation Equations 
According to the present experimental data, an empirical correlation for the 
space-average bubble departure diameters in the FC-72 stable saturated flow boiling on 
the heated circular copper flat plate flush mounted on the bottom of the rectangular

CHAPTER 12 
CONCLUDING REMARKS  
 
12.1 Concluding Remarks  
We have carried out experiments to unravel the refrigerants R-134a, R-407C and R-410A 
and dielectric coolant FC-72 time periodic flow boiling heat transfer characteristics (including 
subcooled and saturated boiling and evaporation heat transfer) and associated bubble 
characteristics in a horizontal narrow annular duct due to an imposed flow rate or heat flux 
oscillation. The effects of the refrigerant saturated temperature, inlet subcooling, vapor quality, 
gap size, and mean level, amplitude and period of the mass flux or heat flux oscillation on the 
temporal boiling heat transfer characteristics have been examined in detail. A summary of the 
major findings from the present results is given in the following.  
12.1.1 Concluding remarks for mass flux oscillation  
(1). The time-average boiling curves and heat transfer coefficients for the time periodic 
saturated and subcooled flow boiling and evaporation of refrigerants R-134a, R-407C and 
R-410A and dielectric coolant FC-72 are not affected to a noticeable degree by the 
amplitude and period of the refrigerant mass flux or imposed heat flux oscillation.  
(2). For the mass flux oscillation the resulting heated pipe wall temperature, bubble departure 
diameter and frequency, and active nucleation site density also oscillate periodically in time 
and at the same frequency as the mass flux oscillation. Data also show that the oscillation 
amplitude of the wall temperature gets larger for a longer period and a larger amplitude of 
the mass flux oscillation. Besides for a larger amplitude of the mass flux oscillation, 
stronger oscillations in the bubble characteristics, such as dp, f and nac, are noted. But f and 
nac are only slightly affected by the period of the mass flux oscillation. A short time lag in 
the heated wall temperature oscillation is also noted. Moreover, the bubbles become smaller 
and more dispersed when the refrigerant mass flux increases with time. The opposite 
processes take place for a decreasing refrigerant mass flux. Furthermore, reductions in the 
size of the departing bubbles and in the active nucleation site density and augmentation in 
the bubble departure frequency result in the time duration the mass flux is rising. When the 
mass flux is sinking the opposite processes occur.  
(3). For the mass flux oscillation the resulting heated pipe wall temperature and evaporating 
flow pattern also oscillate periodically in time and at the same frequency as the mass flux 
 659
transfer coefficient and bubble parameters, such as dp, f and nac, get larger for a longer 
period and a larger amplitude of the imposed heat flux oscillation and for a higher mean 
imposed heat flux. An increase in the inlet liquid subcooling results in stronger oscillations 
in the boiling heat transfer coefficient and heated surface temperature. Moreover, a 
significant time lag in the heated copper duct surface temperature oscillation is also noted, 
which apparently results from the thermal inertia of the copper duct. The nondimensional 
time lag, defined as the ratio of the time lag to the period of the imposed heat flux 
oscillation, is longer at a lower mean imposed heat flux and a shorter period and for a larger 
amplitude of the imposed heat flux oscillation when its amplitude is below 30%. 
Furthermore, the bubbles become smaller and more dispersed after the time lag when the 
imposed heat flux and heated wall temperature decrease with time. The opposite processes 
take place at increasing heat flux. Finally, reductions in the size of the departing bubbles, 
the bubble departure frequency and active nucleation site density result in the time duration 
the heat flux is sinking. When the heat flux is rising the opposite processes occur.  
(2). For the heat flux oscillation the resulting heated pipe wall temperature and evaporating flow 
pattern also oscillate periodically in time and at the same frequency as the heat flux 
oscillation. Experiments also show that the resulting wall temperature oscillation is stronger 
for a longer period and a larger amplitude of the imposed heat flux oscillation and for a 
higher mean imposed heat flux. A significant time lag in the heated surface temperature 
oscillation is also noted, which apparently results from the thermal inertia of the copper 
inner pipe. The nondimensional time lag, defined as the ratio of the time lag to the period of 
the imposed heat flux oscillation, is longer at a lower mean imposed heat flux and a shorter 
period. Moreover, at the intermediate vapor quality changes in the evaporating flow patterns 
between that dominated by the nucleation bubbles and by the liquid film take place 
cyclically. Furthermore, after the time lag the heated pipe wall temperature decreases and 
the evaporation heat transfer gets worse as the heat flux decreases in the first half of the 
periodic cycle. In the second half of the cycle in which the heat flux increases the opposite 
processes occur. These changes of the heating surface temperature and heat transfer 
coefficient with the heat flux oscillation are attributed to the strong effects of the heat flux 
oscillation on the changes of the vapor quality and liquid film thickness in the evaporating 
flow.  
(3). The effects of the heat flux oscillation at extremely short and long periods have been 
explored. Due to the existence of the thermal inertia of the heated copper duct, the resulting 
heated surface temperature does not oscillate with time and is close to that in the stable 
boiling at an extremely short period of the imposed heat flux oscillation. But the oscillation
