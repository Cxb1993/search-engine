Abstract 
In this research project, the synthesis of carboxyl adsorber was carried out by applying 
acrylic acid grafting onto polypropylene (PP) fabrics with the gamma-ray (γ-ray) preirradiation. 
The grafting conditions, such as acrylic acid concentration, gamma-ray dose rate and dose, 
grafting time, grafting temperature were conducted to obtain the optimum carboxyl adsorber 
manufacturing conditions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of carboxyl adsorber for removal heavy 
metal ions using various operating conditions such as reaction time, pH and metal/carboxyl 
adsorber molar ratio was also evaluated in this research. Lastly, we select the appropriate 
desorption agents to discuss the effectiveness of heavy metal ions desorption and durability of 
re-adsorption works. Moreover, synthetic wastewater and electroplating wastewater were used 
to evaluate the feasibility of the prepared adsorption materials.

三、文獻探討 
3-1 聚丙烯纖維 
聚丙烯(PP)纖維係將聚丙烯化合物熔融紡絲而得之合成纖維。丙烯經由聚合而成之聚
合體有三種立體異構物，亦即同排(isotactic)，對排(syndiotactic)與亂排(atactic)聚
丙烯。同排聚丙烯：聚合物的分子結構中，所有的甲基均在主碳鏈之同一邊成有規則性的
排列，其軟化點與結晶度均高。聚丙烯在常溫狀態下具良好的耐酸、耐鹼及耐化學藥品性，
聚丙烯纖維目前多普遍應用於醫療衛生、電氣產業、化學工業、建材及日常生活一般清潔
用品（高木謙行等,1981）。聚丙烯纖維具有許多優越的物化性，諸如回彈性佳、韌性良好、
抗化學性、絕緣抵抗大及原料價格低廉等優點，且由於透氣性佳、生產過程無添加任何其
他化學藥劑，因此被視為具環保、功能、科技的優良素材之一。聚丙烯結構式如圖 3-1 所
示： 
 
                        —(—CH2—CH—)n— 
                                  ︱  
                                  CH3

3-2 親水性基團 
丙烯酸單體，其末端官能基為-COOH，結構如圖 3-2 所示，可與水、酒精、乙醚互溶。
文獻研究指出丙烯酸單體濃度、反應溫度及反應時間均會對接枝率造成影響，進而影響親
水性反應特性。Sundardi（1978）將丙烯酸單體接枝於γ射線處理過之聚丙烯纖維上，並
以不同種類的染劑進行染色，以探討接枝纖維的物性變化，以及探討反應溫度、接枝速率、
接枝率相互關係。由實驗結果可發現丙烯酸接枝於聚丙烯纖維後，回潮率增加接枝率也隨
之提升，使聚丙烯纖維擁有良好的吸濕性以及染色性。Mukherjee and Gupta（1985）利用
輻射誘導接枝甲基丙烯酸於聚丙烯纖維上，探討接枝時溶劑效應、物性變化及染色行為。
發現接枝時溶劑添加可提高接枝率，但接枝後會造成纖維的整體結晶度下降、密度增加、
直徑變大及擴散係數提高等現象。重金屬離子反應效能方面，Chio et al., (1999) 以γ射線
誘導接枝的方式將丙烯酸單體接枝於聚乙烯纖維（PE）的表面，並用來吸附水溶液中的
Cu2+、Cd2+、Th4+等金屬離子。經由 IR 光譜分析，在 1730 cm-1 的特性吸收峰為丙烯酸中的
C=O 官能基，1610 及 1275 cm-1 則分別代表-COO-及-COO-M 之峰值。Karakisla (2002)將聚
酯纖維以濕式接枝法接上丙烯酸單體後，去除 Cu2+離子溶液，接枝丙烯酸單體之後的聚酯
纖維吸附效果可由 0.025 mmol Cu/g 增加至 0.118 mmol Cu/g。Lin and Hsieh(1997) 亦以 RF
首先應用γ-射線激活纖維表面，將聚丙烯、PET 纖維樣品送至核能研究所 Co-60 輻射
照射廠進行照射，劑量率為 100～500 Gy/min，劑量則規劃為 20～60 kGy，氣氛條件則分
別為氮氣及空氣。試驗過程將探討劑量率、劑量、氣氛對聚丙烯、PET 纖維活化之影響，
將由表面親水性變化、水分天平分析結果研判適宜之輻射照射活化纖維操作條件。 
清洗完後之羧基型吸附材移置真空冷凍乾燥機中乾燥至恆重為（W1），由式 3-1 及 3-2 可得

 (b) 水分乾燥速率測定 
水分乾燥速率是依據經濟部中央標準局水分乾燥測定法(CNS 12915)，將試片平放於
水分天平中，距試片上方等距離處滴下 0.2 mL 之去離子水，在標準狀態下(溫度 20±2°C、
相對濕度 65±2%)，紀錄水分含水率變化情形。當液體吸附至材料表面上之表面張力較基
料表面能量為高時，液體分子將聚集在一起，成為較大的液滴或水珠，而不能分散於材料
的表面，具較差之潤濕性；反之，當液體的表面張力較基材之表面能量小時，液體於基材
表面分散，而具較佳之潤濕性。由於聚丙烯纖維經接枝聚合後其表面能量受到改變，滴某
一定量之去離子水於其表面，將具不同之分散/擴散效果。若分散效果較佳、擴散面積較
廣，使接觸受加熱之面積亦較大，纖維表面水分散失所需時間越短，水分散失速率越大，
代表其接枝聚合效果好。 
(c) 固相微化學特性分析 
使用傅立葉轉換紅外光譜儀 (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer, FTIR)，觀察試樣官
能基鍵結情形。Bhattacharya and Inamdar（2006）研究中提到，1700-1750cm-1 會產生羧
基（-COOH）中的（C=O）吸收峰。本研究預期接枝聚合反應前後特性吸收峰將有明顯變化，
顯示其鍵結情形已改變。將搭配 FTIR 特徵吸收峰值及面積量變化，佐證具羧基（-COOH）
親水官能基的丙烯酸（AAc）單體已成功接枝於聚丙烯纖維表面，而形成羧基型離子交換材，
並嘗試半定量其數量值。除 FTIR 分析外，利用掃描式電子顯微鏡（SEM）觀察纖維接枝前
後形成羧基型離子交換材顯微型態（Morphology）之改變，預期纖維表面將被丙烯酸單體
覆蓋，產生不同顯微型態，再佐以 X光能量散佈儀 Energy-Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS)分
析其微觀元素比例；元素分析儀分析其巨觀元素比例變化，搭配其他分析儀器，了解接枝
聚合反應機制與行為。綜合討論接枝率（GP）、接枝效率（GE）、水分乾燥速率、表面羧基
含量、潤濕率結果，可清楚解釋離子交換材表面特性及接枝率、單位羧基型離子交換材上
之表面 COOH 基含量、潤溼率、水分乾燥速率之關係。

Preirradiation grafting technique has been widely studied in order to modify the properties of 
various materials. When organic polymers are subjected to ionizing radiation, the trapped radical or 
macromolecular peroxides and hydroperoxides, capable of initiating graft copolymerization reaction 
are formed. And the grafting activity of preirradiatied polymers can be well kept at lower 
temperature [3]. Moreover, a result has been reported that the grafting activity of radiation 
peroxidized polyethylene film can also be kept at room temperature more than three months [4]. 
The present study utilized the capability of gamma-ray (γ-ray) preirradiation in modifying the 
surface properties of materials to activate the polypropylene (PP) fabrics surfaces, which was 
followed by a grafting procedure. The effects of acrylic acid concentration, grafting time, grafting 
temperature were conducted to obtain the optimum carboxyl adsorber manufacturing conditions. 
Furthermore, the effectiveness of carboxyl adsorber for copper removal was also evaluated in this 
research. During the study, the water loss rate was used to determine the modification effects under 
various γ-ray irradiation parameters. The grafting yield weight method was used to evaluate the 
grafting effects under different grafting parameters. 
Materials and Method 
The present study exploited the activation and modification properties of gamma-ray (γ-ray) 
preirradiation combined with the grafting technology to develop the ion exchanger capable of 
absorbing the heavy metal ions in wastewater in order to remove them from the wastewater. The 
experimental procedure, materials, equipment and methodology are illustrated below. 
 
Materials and irradiation 
Polypropylene (PP) fabrics was used as the substrate under various γ-ray irradiation treatment 
parameters. The γ-ray irradiation from Co-60 was carried out at an exposure rate of 400 Gy/hr 
under air and N2 gas, and the irradiation dose was 20 kGy. The water loss rate was based to 
determine the activation effects of substrates for selecting the optimal γ-ray irradiation treatment 
parameters. 
 
Grafting procedure 
The substrate after γ-ray irradiation treatment was subject to grafting treatment under monomer 
concentrations of 6M, grafting times (3hr, 6hr), and grafting temperatures (80°C, 90°C). The 
grafting experiments were performed in a glass vessel, the distilled water and additives were added 
first, followed by AAc. The irradiated PP fabric was immersed in the AAc solution. The grafting 
reaction was carried out in water bath which was set at relevant temperature. After grafting reaction, 
the grafted samples were taken out from glass vessel, and washed with methanol and distilled water 
to remove the homopolymer. The weight method was used to calculate the grafting yields, the 
degree of grafting was determined as the follows: 
Degree of grafting (%) (also known as grafting percentage, GP) =                       (1) 
 
Where, W0 and W1 are the weight of PP fiber samples before and after grafting, respectively. 
 
 
Heavy metal removal experiments 
The ion exchangers with the optimal grafting effects prepared according to the PP fabrics 
irradiation and grafting treatment described above were used in the experiments of heavy metal 
adsorption. The adsorption behaviors were observed under various adsorption environments. 
Moreover, liquid and solid phase analyses were conducted to study the adsorption results and 
properties. The SEM-EDS and the FTIR analyses were applied to demonstrate the performance and 
the function of the grafted materials.

Figure 5 showed the effects of different solution pH values on the adsorption of heavy metals. 
From the trend, it was discovered that the adsorption of copper ions was higher when pH > 3. It was 
believed that the H
+
 ions of higher concentration at a low pH competed with the positively charged 
heavy metal ions for the adsorption sites [9,10] of COO- on the surface of the ion exchanger, 
resulting in the observed trend in the Figure.

Conclusion 
The present study used PP fibers as the substrate and using γ-ray irradiation treatment for 
modifying the surface properties in order to increase the hydrophilicity of the PP fibers. Afterwards, 
an ion exchanger capable of adsorbing heavy metals was prepared by acrylic acid grafting.  
After the surface modification and activation of the PP fibers byγ-ray irradiation treatment, 
hydrophilicity could be improved to be favorable for acrylic acid grafting. At a grafting temperature 
of 90°C, the grafting yield could reach 3.85% under such conditions. The use of γ-ray irradiation 
to modify PP fibers could improve the grafting yield and successfully prepared the ion exchanger to 
adsorb heavy metals. Furthermore, copper ions can be effectively adsorbed with the adsorption 
capacity of 4.5-5.0 mgCu/g-ion exchanger. Hence PP carboxyl-type adsorption material showed the 
ability for heavy metal removal application. This treatment is unique due to its convenience, 
quickness, low energy consumption, and environmental friendly. The adsorption behavior was 
believed to be a physical adsorption reaction useful for the subsequent desorption and recycling of 
heavy metals. This treatment displays a great potential for wastewater treatment, but thus requires 
further advanced studies.

Abstract 
 
In this research, the synthesis of carboxyl adsorber was carried out by applying acrylicacid 
grafting onto polypropylene (PP) fabrics with the gamma-ray (γ-ray) preirradiation. The grafting 
conditions, such as which kind of fabrics used, acrylic acid concentration, gamma-ray dose rate and 
dose, grafting time, grafting temperature were conducted to obtain the optimum carboxyl adsorber 
manufacturing conditions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of carboxyl adsorber for removal heavy 
metal ions using various operating conditions such as reaction time, pH and metal/carboxyl 
adsorber molar ratio was also evaluated in this research. Lastly, the appropriate desorption agents 
were selected to discuss the effectiveness of heavy metal ions desorption and durability of 
re-adsorption works. Moreover, synthetic wastewater and electroplating wastewater were used to 
evaluate the feasibility of the prepared adsorption materials. 
 
Keywords: gamma-ray, fabrics, grafting, carboxyl adsorber, heavy metal removal 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The electroplating industry and the semiconductor industry have advanced and prospered in 
recent years. As a result, the release of wastewater containing heavy metals produced in the 
manufacturing process has increased gradually year after year. According to the statistical data 
(2007) of the Industrial Development Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the wastewater 
produced by the electroplating plants throughout the country reached 415,700 CMD. In order to 
handle such an enormous quantity of wastewater containing heavy metals, the development of 
economical and environmentally friendly materials to remove the heavy metals in wastewater for 
isolating and recycling has become an important subject worth further investigations. The 
traditional methods for the treatment of waste water containing heavy metals include chemical 
sedimentation, ion exchange, absorption, reverse osmosis, and diaphragm filtration (Bailey et al, 
1999). Among these methods, the addition of a base plus coagulation and sedimentation is the most 
commonly used method. By the addition of an alkaline solution, the metal ion is allowed to react 
with hydroxide to form the fairly insoluble metal oxide compound, followed by coagulation and 
sedimentation, to isolate the solid from the liquid for the removal of heavy metals. However, due to 
the dense urban environment with limited land resources in Taiwan, the traditional sedimentation 
method involving the addition of chemical reagents has become less and less appropriate for 
dealing with the enormous quantity of wastewater produced due to the need of a large 
sedimentation area. Moreover, the disposal and treatment of sludge generated by such method 
posses another challenge to overcome. Without proper treatment, the heavy metals may be released 
from the acidic soil leading to a secondary environmental hazard (McDonald et al., 2006). The 
reverse osmosis method requires a higher operational cost and thus is difficult to be used 
 
In general, when the surface tension of liquid is lower than that of substrate, the liquid spreads 
to the surface of substrate. As the energy of the substrate surface varied, the degree of water spread 
also varied. An increasing water loss rate indicated a shorter time for water to be lost on the 
substrate surface, and a greater degree of water spread required for a large heating area. This 
phenomenon illustrated the effect on hydrophilicity byγ-ray irradiation modification. Therefore, 
the comparison of water loss rates using this experimental method could reveal the effects on 
hydrophilicity after the treatment. Under various modification durations, the water loss rates were 
3.3%/min and 8.3%/min for unmodified (original) PP fiber and modified (the γ-ray irradiation 
modification) PP fiber, respectively. Owing to the γ-ray irradiation (activation) reaction, the water 
loss rate increased, indicating the increasing hydrophilicity of the fiber’s surface. 
 
3.2. Investigation of the conditions for the acrylic acid grafting of γ-ray irradiation modified PP – 
grafting yield determination 
 
The present study selected acrylic acid with a COOH functional group as the grafting 
monomer for the grafting reaction to prepare the ion exchangers with the effect of absorbing heavy 
metal ions. The effects of the factors, including grafting temperature, acrylic acid monomer 
concentration and grafting time on the grafting results during the process were investigated. Figure 
1 illustrates the results using FTIR-ATR to analyze the functional groups on the surface of PP fibers 
before and after theγ-ray irradiation treatment. From the Figure it was found that it was difference 
between the functional groups on the surface of the ion exchanger after grafting of the γ-ray 
preirradiation PP fibers. It was found that the characteristic peak of C=O of COOH in acrylic acid 
fell at 1720 cm-1 (Kondo et al., 2006).

Figure 2 revealed that the grafting yields altered at grafting temperature of 80°C and 90°C, 
with the grafting yield of average 1.68% and 3.39%, respectively. It was believed that, under 
elevated temperature, the peroxy groups or the initiators on the substrate surface were easily 
decomposed thermally to form free radicals leading to a higher grafting probability with a higher 
grafting yield. Another cause for the increased grafting yield at elevated temperature was that the
