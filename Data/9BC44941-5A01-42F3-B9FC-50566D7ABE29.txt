ABSTRACT 
The idea of Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) is using a short range and low power wireless network 
technology to connect certain devices. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the technologies to realize 
WPAN. It can setup a low cost, low power and low data transfer rate wireless network in a particular area by 
deploying several network nodes. The application includes building automation, industrial control, remote 
control and healthcare. This study proposes a micro-device monitoring system based on ZigBee wireless 
sensor network. We utilize this sensor network to study two practical applications for micro-device. One is 
novel operation process for the analysis of flow control in microfluidic devices. The other is investigation of 
possibility of generating high resolution chemical image. This remote monitoring system can be adapted for 
other devices, as well as other vital sign measurements. It represents the first step in developing a ubiquitous 
sensing platform for telemedicine and remote monitoring.

1 Introduction 
Recent advances in the field of Microsystems have made possible the miniaturization of microfluidic 
systems on a microchip to carry out analytical analytes. Current devices monitoring instrumentation and 
practices can be restrictive. For example, in the mixing process, mixed samples degree monitoring can be 
monitored continuously with CCD (charge-coupled device) camera. This is an external detection camera to 
detect the mixing and collection the data in specific computer. The limitations of this are that the accuracy is 
highly variable. On the other hand, in computer use efficiency, due to the detection system is use wire 
equipment to set in traditional condition, the computer can only collect single data every time. A simple and 
cost effective solution is to utilize implantable microsystems utilizing wireless telemetry, which could 
increase monitoring efficiency by minimizing staff work load, increasing the amount of data obtained, and 
streamlining its storage and processing.  
Wireless connectivity is going to offer the next evolutionary development step in the biomedical signals 
monitoring applications such as wireless sensor network [1]. A wireless sensor network is a wireless network 
consisting of autonomous sensor to monitor the physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, 
sound, vibration or pressure, at different locations [2-4]. There are many proposed researches allowing the

2.2 Generation of chemical image 
In this work, we demonstrate an amorphous-Si based LAPS structure and a commercially available 
projector as light source to generate the chemical image with high resolution. The schematic block diagram of 
the experimental set-up is shown in Fig.2(a). The size, shape, movement, and modulation frequency of the 
light spot can be generated by the projector with computer-aided control. An objective lens of 50x is used to 
focus the light beam from the projector and the square shaped spot of size 50x50 μm is used for experiment. 
The atomic layer deposition technique (ALD) was used to deposit 10 nm HfO2 on a-Si/ITO/glass substrate as 
sensing membrane (Fig.2(b)).  
 
2.3 Framework of WSN 
An overview of the steps in setting up an IEEE 802.15.4 based network is provided in Fig. 3. Once the 
network has been created by the coordinator, the end devices are allowed to join the network by performing 
Active Scan. In data transmission, the direct transmission is used to transfer the data from the end device to 
the coordinator. An End Device always sends a data frame directly to the Personal Area Network (PAN) 
coordinator. Once it has received the data, the coordinator may send an acknowledgement to the end device.  
 
3 Results and discussion 
For development an intelligent microfluidic monitoring system, we design and set-up a wireless senor 
network system with Graphics User Interface (GUI)-based management to achieve this objective. The 
wireless sensor network is comprised of a PAN coordinator, routers and end devices. This study uses ZigBee 
wireless technology to develop the wireless sensor network. ZigBee is based on IEEE 802.15.4 wireless 
protocol, which focuses on sensor networks, control and home-care related applications. Fig.4 presents a 
schematic diagram of WSN framework. The experimental data deliver to embeded control system by ZigBee 
wireless technology. Beside, users can obtain the specific data and show in mobile device by wire/wireless 
environment.  
During the injection procedure, Distance line (D-line) is designed to introduce a quantity of buffer 
between successive discrete sample plugs in order to ensure that diffusive mixing does not take place between 
them in transportation process. As discussed previously, the length of the D-line is instrumental in 
determining the length of the buffer between successive sample plugs in the injection channel. Fig. 5 presents 
the result for the influence of D-line on production plug sample. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the plug samples are 
unable to separate entirely in channel-a. However, as shown in Fig. 5(b), under the same operating conditions, 
the introduction of a D-line, and hence permitting sufficient buffer to flow into channel-a between two 
successive samples. In the discrete injection process, it is necessary that different plugs are fully dispensed 
into the designated reservoirs. As discussed previously, the length of the sample plug introduced into 
channel-a can be controlled simply by regulating the time for which reservoir is grounded. In Fig. 6(a-c), 
concentration field determined through fluorescence imaging are shown over a complete injection cycle. 
Further, the performance of the discrete injection process is demonstrated in determination of fluorescent dye 
intensity (see Fig. 6(d)). The result show that the discrete injection procedure can be performed cyclically and 
continuously once the appropriate operating conditions have been specified and set up.  
For a chemical image generation process, a buffer solution is used as test solution. Fig. 7 shows that
