Abstract 
With the help of Partitioned Iterated Function 
System (PIFS) and Collage theorem, we can encode 
an image by using the technique of fractal image 
compression and achieve the high compression ratio.  
The underlying premise of this coding scheme is 
based on the self-similarity property of real life 
images.  However, it is time-consuming in the 
encoding process since each range block must find 
the most similar block from a large amount of blocks 
which are called domain blocks.  Such drawback 
leads the real time applications to be impossible.  
In the past, some methods are presented by the 
researchers to speedup the fractal encoder, in which 
the classification skill is the one of the commonly 
used methods.  By using the classification method, 
both of the range block and domain block are 
classified according to their characteristics.  Each 
range block does the similarity match only with the 
domain blocks which belong to the same category 
with the range block.  The time-consume in the 
encoding process will be saved, since the number of 
the similarity match is reduced.  But up to now, all 
the classification methods proposed by the 
researchers are belonging to the hard classification 
ones.  It leads that the range block can not find the 
proper optimal solution, since the category of some 
good candidates is not the same as the one of range 
block.  In this project, I will propose a soft 
classification method – fuzzy C-means cluster 
algorithm to overcome the drawback of the hard 
classification.  Differing with the traditional hard 
classification methods, the fuzzy cluster algorithm 
only offers the information of membership of the 
block belongs to each category.  Both of the range 
block and domain block can be done the similarity 
match only at the degrees of membership of the two 
blocks belonging to the same category are high.  
Hence for each range block, all the good domain 
blocks can be preserved and the redundant similarity 
match can be ignored.  The goals obtaining good 
retrieved image quality and saving the encoding 
time will be achieved simultaneously.  Finally, the 
proposed method also attempts to compare with the 
other hard classification methods to demonstrate the 
performance of the proposed method.

一、前言 
Fractal image compression was first proposed in 
1985 by Barnsley originated from Iterated Function 
System (IFS) [1].  The practical coding algorithm 
has not realized until 1992 by Jacquin [2].  The 
underlying idea of the coding scheme is based on the 
Partitioned Iteration Function System (PIFS) which 
utilized the self-similarity characteristic in a nature 
image to achieve the purpose of compression [3, 4]. 
The encoding process of the fractal image 
compression is very time-consuming. The reason is 
that most of the encoding time is spent on a large 
amount of computations of similarity measure in 
order to find the best matched domain block for each 
range block. Hence the main research direction for 
fractal image compression is focused on how to 
reduce the encoding time. Many encoding 
techniques were presented by the researchers to 
speedup the fractal encoder. These techniques 
include classification techniques [5-8], quad-tree 
technique [9-12], and evolutionary computation 
technique [13-19] etc. 
The detailed content of the report is organized as 
follows.  The goal of the research is described in 
Section 2. Section 3 lists the reference papers cited

四、碎形影像壓縮 
The fractal image compression is based on the 
local self-similarity property in a nature image.  
The fundamental idea is coming from the Partitioned 
Iterated Function System (PIFS).  Suppose the 
original gray level image f  is of size mm .  
Let the range pool R be defined as the set of all 
non-overlapping blocks of size nn  of the image 
f , which makes up 2)/( nm  blocks. For obeying 
the Contractive Mapping Fixed-Point Theorem, the 
domain block must exceed 2 times than the range 
block in length. Thus, let the domain pool D be 
defined as the set of all possible blocks of size 
nn 22  of the image f, which makes up 
2)12(  nm  blocks. For m is 256 and n is 8, the 
range pool R is composed of 
1024)8/256()8/256(   blocks of size 88  and 
the domain pool D is composed of 
58081)116256()116256(   blocks of size 
1616 .  For each range block v from the R, the 
fractal affine transformation is constructed by 
searching all of the domain blocks in the D to find 
the most similar one and the parameters representing 
the fractal affine transformation will form the fractal 
compression code of v. 
To execute the similarity measure between range 
block and domain block, the size of the domain 
block must be first sub-sampled to 88  such that 
its size is the same as v. Let u denote a sub-sampled 
domain block.  The similarity of two image blocks 
u and v of size nn  is measured by mean square 
error (MSE) defined as

The fractal affine transformation allows the eight 
transformations of the domain block u in the 
Dihedral. The eight transformations 
7,,1,0: kTk  can be expressed by the matrices 
in Table 1, in which the origin of u is assumed to 
locate at the center of the block. By the eight 
transformation, eight transformed blocks are 
generated and denoted by 7,,1,0: kuk , 
respectively, where 0u  is equal to the original 
sub-sampled domain block u. Fig. 1 lists the diagram 
of the eight Dihedral transformations. 0T  picks the 
origin block u. 1T  and 2T  are the flip of u with 
respect to horizontal and vertical lines, respectively. 
3T  is the flip of u with respect to both horizontal 
and vertical lines. 4T , 5T , 6T , and 7T  are the 
transformations which flip the 0u , 1u , 2u , and 
3u  along the main diagonal line xy  , respectively. 
Thus for a given block from the range pool, there are 
648,464858081   MSE computations must be 
done in order to obtain the most similar block from 
the domain pool. Thus, in total, one needs 
552,799,475648,4641024   MSE  computations 
to encode the whole image using this full search 
compression method.

The fractal affine transformation also allows the 
contrast scaling p and the brightness offset q on the 
transformed blocks. Thus the fractal affine 
transformation   of ),( yxu  can be expressed as

will have similar edge features. Therefore, all of the 
range blocks and domain blocks will be normalized 
to gather at a straight line connecting the two points: 
(1,0) and )22,22(  to execute the fuzzy 
clustering easily. The illustration is shown in Fig. 2. 
We can see that all the image blocks locate at the 
line segment between (1,0) and )22,22( .

The process of the iterative optimization of the 
objective function shown in (3) is not stopped until 
the condition    )()1(max kijkijij uu  is satisfied. 
Here, δ is the termination criterion and k is the 
iteration steps. 
Since the number of the range blocks is much less 
than that of the domain blocks, to reduce the 
complexity of cluster, only the range blocks for an 
image are utilized to execute the cluster process to 
find the center of each cluster. Once the cluster 
process is completed, both the centers of all the 
clusters and the degrees of membership of all the 
range blocks belong to each cluster are obtained. 
Then all the domain blocks are substituted into (5) to 
find the degrees of membership of they belong to 
each cluster. A threshold value ε is set to determine 
whether the MSE computation between the range 
block and the domain block is done or not. For the 
range block and the domain block, if there is at least 
one cluster, such that the degrees of membership of 
the two blocks belong to the cluster are larger than ε, 
the probability that they have the same texture is 
high. For the range block, the domain block is a 
good candidate for the best matched solution and 
their similarity measure is done. On the contrary, if 
there is not any cluster to let the degrees of 
membership of the two blocks belong to the cluster 
be larger than ε, the probability that they have the 
same texture is low. For the range block, the domain 
block is not a good candidate for the best matched 
solution. The similarity measure is not done. 
Therefore, some redundant MSE computations can 
be reduced and the purpose of speedup can be 
reached. 
The detailed steps for the proposed method are 
stated as follows: 
 
Step 1. Specify the threshold value ε and the cluster 
parameters including the number of cluster L, 
the termination criterion δ and the weight m. 
Step 2. For all of the range and domain blocks, 
calculate the )0,1(F  and )1,0(F  from (1) 
and (2), respectively, and constitute their 
DCT absolute coefficient pair

Step 3. Normalize the DCT absolute coefficient pair

least one cluster, such that the degrees of 
membership of both the range block and the domain 
block belong to the cluster are high. Therefore the 
purpose of speedup can be reached. The experiment 
demonstrates that the encoding time of the proposed 
method is 42.47 times faster than that of the full 
search method, while the cost is only 0.9dB decay 
for image quality.
