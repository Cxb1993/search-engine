2shape when the distance from the antenna is large
enough. Therefore, to obtain the far-field pattern of
a given antenna is the main objective of
the pattern measurement. According to the
reciprocity theorem, the receiving pattern of an
antenna is identical to its transmitting pattern. That is,
the far-field pattern of an antenna can be measured by
recording the received signal when the antenna is
illuminated by a uniform plane wave. The ability
to provide plane wave illumination of the
antenna under test (AUT) is a basic requirement for a
far field range [2, 3].
An indoor far-field range usually consists
an anechoic chamber and a source antenna.
Inside the chamber, the sidewalls, floor, and
ceiling are covered with high-quality absorbers to
reduce the reflected energy level. Even
though, significant reflections can occur
from these surfaces, especially for the case
of large angle incident [4]. In reference [5], it is
suggested that the incident angle should be
limited to be less than 70o for
high-quality absorbers. This limitation leads
to a restriction of the width and height
of the chamber. In most of cases, the
chamber is constructed inside a building
and the overall height has a limitation
about 3 meters. This implies that the overall
length of the chamber should not be
longer than 6.5 meters. It is really a
challenge to design and construct such a
small size chamber for far-field pattern
measurement at frequency below 1 GHz.
In this study, the theoretical view for the chamber
design is simulated by the FDTD method.
In the past decade, much research has
been focused on the development of FDTD
algorithms and the basic algorithm can be found in
numerous textbooks and research papers [6-8]. The
basic principle is to use finite difference to
represent the differential form of the
Maxwel’s  equations.  By employing the Yee 
algorithm [6], the Maxwel’s equations are converted 
into algebraic equations with time-marching style.
The commercial package named
“FIDELITYTM”, based  on  FDTD  algorithm  
released by Zeland Software, Inc., is
employed for this study. Theories and
software setup are given in Sect. 2, preliminary
results are shown and discussed in Sec. 3.
II. Theories and Software Setup
FIDELITYTM is a FDTD based full-wave
electromagnetic simulator released by Zeland
Software, Inc. To apply the FDTD technique to a
practical problem, all objects in the computational
domain must be subdivided into rectangular
parallelepiped cells. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the
anechoic chamber is of length L, width W, and height
H. Inside the chamber, we assume that the sidewalls,
floor, and ceiling are all covered with pyramidal
absorbers. Fig 1(b) shows the chamber geometry
constructed for the FDTD simulation. The chamber
dimension is selected to be 63 3 (lengthwidth
height) m3. The pyramidal absorbers are replaced
with several homogeneous layers. As shown in
reference [9, 10], the layers can be modeled as
uniaxially anisotropic materials and the dielectric
constants are given by:

pyramids (including 3 layers for the absorber base).

The calculated dielectric constants and conductivities
for each layer at 900 MHz are shown in Fig. 3. It is
seen that, between the first three layers (absorber
base) and the last layer (absorber tips), both the
values of dielectric constants and conductivities are
decreased to approach the values of free space.

Fig. 4 shows the time-domain response at (x, y, z) =
(1500 mm, -500 mm, 0) for a typical simulation.
Since a continuous sinusoidal signal of 900 MHz is
used as the excitation source, when recording the
point fields along the scanning axis, it is necessary to
monitor the time-domain response to ensure the field
inside the chamber has become steady. As we can see
in Fig. 4, the system reaches steady state after 900
time steps.
6ripples for both cases of 12-in-pyramid chamber and
18-in-pyramid chamber were calculated and shown.
Results show that, for far-field pattern measurement
at 900 MHz, the quiet-zone quality of 18-in-pyramid
chamber is better than that of the 12-in-pyramid
chamber.
