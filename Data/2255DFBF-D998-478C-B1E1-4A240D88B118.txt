     Link-16 戰術資料鏈路系統為北大西洋公約組織成員國、美國及其盟國（包括台灣）現役之軍
事通訊系統，其主要任務為支援軍種聯合作戰中的「指揮下達」與「作戰管制」等重要作為。Link-16 
可提供艦艇、飛機與陸岸設施（如雷達站）間戰術資料的交換，以利戰場指揮官掌握全般戰場圖像，

因為負責 Link-16 戰術資料的調變與解調，所以 JTIDS 亦被視為 Link-16 的「實體層」。為了提升國

參. 文獻探討 
     如同其他的軍用通訊系統，Link-16/JTIDS 的相關研究向來就裹著一層神秘的面紗。即使美軍
在 1993 年就已經啟用這套系統，有關其「實體層」研究的學術發表，直到 2005 年才首次出現在 IEEE

Abstract—The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System 
(JTIDS) is the communication terminal of Link-16. When the 
double-pulse structure is chosen to transmit the Link-16 data, 
JTIDS is a hybrid direct sequence/fast frequency-hopping spread 
spectrum system with a sequential diversity of two. To minimize 
the effect of pulsed-noise interference (PNI), a noise-normalized 
diversity combining MSK chip demodulator is assumed in the 
JTIDS receiver. The symbol error rate (SER) performance of a 
coherently detected JTIDS-type waveform for the double-pulse 
structure with noise-normalization combining (NNC) in PNI is 
investigated in this paper. To facilitate the evaluation, perfect 
frequency de-hopping, sequence synchronization, chip 
synchronization, and 32-chip sequence descrambling are assumed. 
Furthermore, maximum-likelihood chip detection is assumed 
rather than maximum-likelihood chip-sequence detection since 
the former represents a more practical assumption for a JTIDS 
signal. The results obtained with NNC are compared to those 
without NNC, as well as to those with perfect side information. 
The results show that for a coherently detected JTIDS-type 
waveform with the double-pulse structure, NNC effectively 
mitigates the system degradation caused by PNI.

I. INTRODUCTION 
he Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) 
is the communication terminal of Link-16. Link-16 data 
may be transmitted as either single or double pulses [1]. When 
the double-pulse format is chosen, JTIDS is a hybrid direct 
sequence/fast frequency-hopped (FFH) spread spectrum 
system with a sequential diversity of two. JTIDS features 
Reed-Solomon (RS) codes for channel coding, cyclic 
code-shift keying (CCSK) for 32-ary baseband symbol 
modulation, and minimum-shift keying (MSK) for waveform 
modulation.  Currently, the JTIDS waveform is detected 
noncoherently at the chip level. In this paper, the symbol error 
rate (SER) performance of a coherently detected JTIDS-type 
waveform is evaluated to ascertain the performance possible if 
coherent demodulation were practical.  
The performances of Link-16/JTIDS-type waveforms have 
been analytically investigated [2]-[7].  The analytic expressions 
for the SER performance of a coherently detected JTIDS-type 
waveform for the single-pulse structure in additive white 
Gaussian noise (AWGN) were first given in [2] for both 
errors-only decoding (EOD) and errors-and-erasures decoding 
(EED). The results in [2], however, are based on the overly 
optimistic assumption that the cross-correlation values of the 
CCSK symbols are statistically independent. It has been shown 
in [3] that the cross-correlation values of the CCSK symbol are 
not independent. Based on the findings in [3], the SER 
performance of a coherently detected JTIDS-type waveform 
for both the single- and the double-pulse structure transmitted 
over a Nakagami fading channel with pulsed-noise interference 
(PNI) is investigated in [4] for EOD.  In [5], the SER 
performance of a coherently detected JTIDS-type waveform 
with EED in PNI is evaluated.  The results in [5] show that EED 
outperforms EOD. Unlike [2]-[5], A JTIDS-compatible 
waveform which uses 32-ary orthogonal signaling with 32-chip 
baseband waveforms such as Walsh function to replace CCSK 
and MSK is proposed in [6]. The bit error rate (BER) 
performance of the JTIDS-compatible waveform with EOD in 
PNI is evaluated in [6], whereas the BER performance with 
EED in PNI is investigated in [7]. 
Diversity combining in conjunction with 
noise-normalization has been found to dramatically reduce the 
degradation caused by partial-band noise interference (PBNI) 
for FFH/M-ary frequency-shift keying [8], [9].  In this paper, 
the SER performance of a coherently detected JTIDS-type 
waveform for the double-pulse structure with 
noise-normalization combining (NNC) in PNI is investigated.  
To facilitate the investigation, we assume perfect frequency 
de-hopping, sequence synchronization, chip synchronization, 
and 32-chip sequence descrambling. Furthermore, 
maximum-likelihood chip detection is assumed rather than 
maximum-likelihood chip-sequence detection since the former 
represents a more practical assumption for a JTIDS signal.  The 
results with NNC are compared to those without NNC and to 
those with perfect side information (PSI).  By “perfect” we do 
not mean the best that can be done, we simply mean we have

In this paper, the AWGN and PNI are assumed statistically

B. SER Performance of the double-pulse structure with PSI 
in both AWGN and PNI 
When PNI is present, the system degradation can be reduced 
if we have some information regarding which pulse is jammed 
and which is not. When available, this information is called side 
information.  In this section, we assume perfect side 
information. PSI is not realistic, but it gives us a standard 
against which to measure receivers that have imperfect side 
information. With PSI, we assume that the jammed pulse is 
disregarded except when all pulses are jammed.  Given this 
assumption, we can still use (5) to evaluate the conditional 
probability of channel chip error for both 0  and 2  
cases. In other words, for 0  and , we obtain 2L 

 in (2), we obtain the probability 
of symbol error of a coherently detected JTIDS-type waveform 
for the double-pulse structure with perfect side information in 
both AWGN and PNI. 
C. SER Performance of the double-pulse structure with 
NNC in both AWGN and PNI 
Unlike PSI, a more realistic receiver that can minimize the 
effect of PNI is the noise-normalization combining receiver.  In 
this paper, a coherent MSK chip demodulator with NNC is 
assumed in the JTIDS receiver (Figure 2).   To evaluate the 
SER performance of a coherently detected JTIDS-type 
waveform with noise-normalization combining in both AWGN 
and PNI, an analytic expression for the probability of channel 
chip error given that  pulses are jammed is required. 
When PNI is present, it can be shown that at the in-phase 
channel (top branch) of Figure 2, the random variable 1kX  that 
models the output of the correlator is a Gaussian random 
variable with a probability density function (PDF) given by 
    1 2 21 1 11 exp 22kX k k kkf x x X k       , (9) 
where 1k  or 2 represents the first or the second JTIDS pulse, 
the mean 1 2k cX A  for a binary chip 1 or 0, and the variance 
 2 I cT0k N N   . After noise-normalization, we obtain 
1 1k kZ X k .  Applying the transformation of a single random 
variable, we obtain the PDF of 1kZ as  
    1 21 11 exp 22kZ k k kf z z Z    1  , (10) 
which shows that 1kZ  is also Gaussian with a mean 
 11
k
k
k

Z  , (11) 
and unity variance. Next, soft-decision diversity combining 
yields 
  
when 1   (barrage noise interference), the performance is the 
same whether perfect side information is assumed or not.  This 
is as expected since 1   implies both pulses are jammed.  In 
this case, no jammed pulse is disregarded, and perfect side 
information has no effect.  Lastly, we see that for sufficiently 
large ' 0bE N , the double-pulse structure with perfect side 
information effectively mitigates the degradation caused by 
PNI when the value of  is small.  
The probability of symbol errors of a coherently detected 
JTIDS-type waveform for the double-pulse structure with 
noise-normalization combining in both AWGN and PNI are 
shown in Figures 5 and 6, where ' 0 3bE N  and 13 dB, 
respectively. The results obtained with perfect side information 
are also shown in the figures for the purpose of comparison.

From both Figures 5 and 6, several observations can be made.  
First, when ' 0bE N  is small (Figure 5), NNC outperforms PSI 
for the same  (except 1  ), and the superiority increases as 
the value of 'b IE N increases. This is consistent with our 
intuition that PSI suffers due to the throwing away of the 
jammed pulses.  Second, when ' 0bE N is large (Figure 6), 
NNC and PSI approach one another, which is as expected.  
Lastly, for sufficiently large ' 0bE N , the double-pulse structure 
with NNC can effectively neutralize the effects of PNI when 
 is small.  
V. CONCLUSION 
The probability of symbol error of a coherently detected 
JTIDS-type waveform for the double-pulse structure with 
noise-normalization combining in both AWGN and PNI was 
investigated. The results are compared to those without 
noise-normalization combining as well as to those with perfect 
side information. Our results show that for a coherently 
detected JTIDS-type waveform with the double-pulse structure 
investigated in this paper, a noise-normalized combining MSK 
chip demodulator effectively mitigates the degradation caused 
by PNI when both ' 0bE N is large and  is small.  Given 
hostile jamming, this is the best result we can hope for since the 
jammer is forced to abandon PNI and adopt a jamming strategy 
such as BNI.

detected JTIDS-type waveform in both Nakagami fading channels and pulsed-noise 
interference (PNI) is investigated in [4] for errors-only RS decoding. Next year, the SER 
performance of a coherently detected JTIDS-type waveform with EED in PNI is 
evaluated in [5]. Its results show that EED outperforms errors-only RS decoding. Unlike 
[2]-[5], [6] proposed a JTIDS-compatible waveform which uses 32-ary orthogonal 
signaling with 32-chip baseband waveforms such as Walsh function to replace CCSK and 
MSK. In 2010, the SER performance of a coherently detected JTIDS-type waveform with 
noise-normalization combining (NNC) in PNI is analyzed in [7], whereas the bit error 
rate (BER) performance of the JTIDS-type waveform with concatenated codes in PNI is 
evaluated in [8]. Both proposed systems outperform the original design of JTIDS.  
With an aim to enhance the anti-jam capability of JTIDS, in this paper a noise-
normalization combining MSK (NNC/MSK) chip demodulator and a concatenated 
coding scheme are assumed in the JTIDS transceiver to replace the original MSK chip 
demodulator and errors-only RS coding scheme, respectively. Neither NNC nor 
concatenated coding is new, but the idea of combining both in the JTIDS transceiver to 
enhance its anti-jam capability has not been presented before. To facilitate the analysis, 
the BER performances of the proposed JTIDS transceiver are evaluated in both AWGN 
and PNI assuming perfect frequency de-hopping, sequence and chip synchronization, and 
descrambling. Moreover, maximum-likelihood chip detection is assumed rather than 
maximum-likelihood sequence detection since the former represents a more practical 
assumption for the JTIDS signal [1].  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system model of the proposed 
JTIDS transceiver is introduced in Section II. The performance analyses of the original 
and the proposed JTIDS transceiver over AWGN and PNI are discussed in Section III. 
Numerical results are presented in Section IV, and the major findings and contributions 
of this paper are summarized in the last section. 
2   System Model Description 
2.1 The Proposed JTIDS Transmitter 
As shown in the left-hand-side branch of Figure 2.1 (excluding the highlighted 
block), the original JTIDS transmitter consists of a bit-to-symbol converter, a RS channel 
encoder, a symbol interleaver, a 32-ary CCSK baseband symbol modulator, a sequence 
scrambler, a frequency-hopping circuit, and a MSK chip level modulator. To enhance the 
anti-jam capability of JTIDS, a concatenated coding scheme and a NNC/MSK chip 
demodulator are assumed in the JTIDS transceiver to replace the errors-only RS coding 
scheme and the MSK chip level demodulator, respectively. The differences between the 
original and the proposed JTIDS transceiver are highlighted in Figure 2.1. Note that 
unlike the most popular concatenated coding scheme which uses a RS encoder as the 
outer encoder and a convolutional encoder as the inner encoder, here we have a code rate 
4/5 convolutional encoder as the outer encoder and a (31,15) RS encoder as the inner 
encoder. Thus, the major processes involved to generate the proposed JTIDS waveform 
includes convolutional encoding, bit-to-symbol mapping (5 bits are converted into a 
symbol), RS encoding, pseudo-random symbols interleaving, 32-ary CCSK baseband 
symbol modulation (each 5-bit coded symbol is converted into a 32-chip CCSK 
sequence), 32-chip PN sequence scrambling, MSK waveform modulation on a chip-by-
chip basis, and frequency-hopping. After up-conversion, the JTIDS signal is amplified, 
In Figure 2.2, the input waveform  r t  represents the received noisy JTIDS pulse, 
and the output s  denotes the NNC/MSK demodulated 32-chip sequence ready for de-
scrambling. We assume that the noise measurement circuit shown in Figure 2.2 can 
accurately measure the noise power of each chip. The measured noise power is used to 
normalize the sampled output of the correlator for each chip of the first JTIDS pulse prior 
to soft-decision (SD) combing with each chip of the second JTIDS pulse in order to 
obtain the decision statistics. Since jammed chips are de-emphasized with respect to 
unjammed chips, this procedure minimizes the influence of jammed chips on the overall 
decision statistics. After NNC/MSK chip demodulation and de-scrambling, each 5-bit 
channel symbol is recovered by a 32-ary CCSK baseband symbol demodulator. The 
determination of which channel symbol was received is accomplished by computing the 
cross-correlation between the de-scrambled 32-chip sequence and the 32 possible CCSK 
sequences. Then, the decision is made by choosing the channel symbol with the largest 
cross-correlation value. More details about how to generate 32 possible CCSK sequences 
and how to perform the 32-ary CCSK baseband symbol demodulation are discussed in 
[3]. After symbol de-interleaving, the channel symbols are decoded by an (31,15) RS 
decoder. If the symbol decoding is successful, each 5-bit symbol is converted back into 
bits for HDD Viterbi decoding. If the Viterbi Decoding is successful, the information data 
bits are recovered and sent to the upper layer. 
3   Performance Analyses 
In order to compare the BER performance of the proposed JTIDS transceiver to that 
of the original JTIDS transceiver, the performance analyses are divided into three 
subsections: the original JTIDS transceiver in PNI, the modified JTIDS transceiver (i.e., 
the original JTIDS receiver with concatenated coding but without NNC) in PNI, and the 
proposed JTIDS transceiver in PNI. 
3.1 The Original JTIDS Transceiver in PNI 
To investigate the BER performance of the original JTIDS transceiver in PNI, 
analytic expressions at the output of MSK chip demodulator, CCSK baseband symbol 
demodulator, and RS decoder are required. When a coherent matched filter or correlator 
is used to recover the binary data, MSK has the same performance as BPSK, QPSK, and 
offset QPSK [9]. Furthermore, when AWGN and PNI are statistically independent, PNI 
may be modeled as Gaussian noise. Thus, when coherent MSK chip demodulation is 
practical, the conditional probability of channel chip error cp   at the output of a coherent 
MSK chip level demodulator is given by

The Modified JTIDS Transceiver in PNI 
In this subsection, we analyze the BER performance of the modified JTIDS 
transceiver in PNI. The modified JTIDS transceiver is referred to as the original JTIDS 
transceiver with a concatenated coding (but without NNC) to replace the original errors-
only RS coding. In this case, if comparing to the previous subsection, we can still use 
Equation (3.1) through (3.5) to investigate the BER performance of the modified JTIDS

3.3 The Proposed JTIDS Transceiver in PNI 
In this subsection, we analyze the BER performance of the proposed JTIDS 
transceiver in PNI. The proposed JTIDS transceiver is referred to as the original JTIDS 
transceiver with a concatenated coding as well as a NNC/MSK chip demodulator 
assumed in the transceiver. In this case, Equation (3.2) through (3.7) are still valid for 
evaluating the BER performance of the proposed JTIDS transceiver in both AWGN and 
PNI, but Equation (3.1) needs to be modified due to the additional noise-normalization 
diversity combing circ t shown in Figure 2.2. When PNI is present, it can be shown that 
the random variable kIX  that models the output of the correlator is a Gaussian random 
chosen for JTIDS, the conditional probability of channel chip error is given by

4   Numerical Results

Due to the space constraint and for the best presentation, two signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) cases a sidered for showing the numerical results in this paper. The first case 
is give  ' 0 3bE N  dB which represents the low SNR case, whereas the e is 
given
second cas
' 0 6bE N  dB which represents the intermediate SNR case. Given ' 0 3bE N  dB, 
the BER performa he pro IDS receiver in both AWGN and PNI is shown 
in Figure 4.1 for 0.75
nce of t posed JT
   and 0.25   (i.e., PNI is turned on for 75% and 25% of the 
time), respectively. In order to compare the BER performance of the proposed JTIDS 
system to the modified and the original JTIDS systems, numerical results from these 
three systems are shown in t e same figure. From Figure 4.1, two observations can be 
made. First, given the

For example, given 0.75

榻飯店時已經凌晨兩點了。拖著疲憊的身子，進了房間倒頭就睡了。就這樣，平安地渡過出國的第一
天行程。由於個人發表論文的時間是被安排在十一月二日的下午，所以十月三十一日與十一月一日這
兩天，大部分的時間都在練習發表論文。前年，從美國海軍研究院（Naval Postgraduate School）畢業
並完成電機工程博士學位後，也有好一陣子沒有用英文與人交談了，感覺自己英文的表達能力退步了
許多。 所幸，透過不斷地練習，終於可以在大會規定的20分鐘內完成論文的發表。 
十一月二日的上午，又練習了幾遍論文的發表。為了放鬆心情，於是走到會議中心的展場參觀。
一進入展場，就看見一群人圍繞著一個非常酷炫的機器人。走向前去，發現這個機器人竟能與人閒話
家常，而且對話的內容完全就像真人一般。正覺得嘖嘖稱奇的瞬間，機器人轉過頭來跟我說話，而且
一開口就說中文的「你好」，讓我驚奇不已。到現在，我還在想：”它”怎麼知道我會說中文？是運用智
慧型影像辨識系統嗎？可是亞洲人長得都差不多，為甚麼它不是用韓文、或是日文跟我打招呼呢？科
技發展，真的是日新月異。離開機器人之前，開心地跟它合影（如圖一）。 
離開機器人後，個人參觀了波音、洛克希德馬汀、雷神、Northrop Grumman等幾家大公司的攤位，
因為這些公司或多或少都參與了「戰術資料鏈路系統」（Tactical Data Links）的研發與製造。因為近年
來我個人的研究均是以Link-16為主，所以對這幾家公司也特別有興趣。我在Northrop Grumman公司的
攤位問了幾個技術性的問題，由於解說員無法回答我的問題，所以就把我轉介到美國海軍著名的研究
單位SPAWAR的攤位。SPAWAR的解說員是一位美海軍陸戰隊退役少校，雖然他很友善、也很熱心，
但畢竟不是研發人員，對我的問題知道的非常有限。又閒聊了一會兒，我們交換了名片。看了一下時
間，發現已接近我上場發表論文的時間，於是就匆匆地離開展場，直奔我發表論文的場所。 
雖然，參觀展場這一招奏了效，但輪到我發表論文時還是有點緊張。畢竟，英文不是我們的母語。
要在很短的時間內，說明清楚研究的成果與解釋複雜的數學公式，實在不是一件簡單的工作。所幸，
藉由不斷地練習，不論是在時間的控制上，或是在複雜觀念與研究成果的說明，或是在回答現場觀眾
的問題時，對自己的表現均感到非常滿意（如圖二）。而且，會後有兩位聽眾趨前向我索取簡報的內容
與名片，並表示對我的研究感到興趣。這兩位都是美國人，一位是Nenad Djapic，他是SPAWAR的研究
員，負責整合、測試與研發的工作。另一位則是Robert Baxley，他是Georgia Tech Research Institute的研
究員。順利完成論文發表後，終於可以放輕鬆地坐下來聽別人發表論文。 
十一月三日這一天，我聽了幾場與我個人研究相關論文的發表。從這幾場演講中，發現還有其他
的研究方法可以提升Link-16/JTIDS的性能，也發現專業知識與創意在研發領域中的不可或缺性。返國
前一天（十一月四日），則利用空檔回到母校拜訪許久不見的友人，以及曾經指導過我的教授們。除了
禮貌性的拜會外，也向他們請益目前個人在研究方面所遭遇的問題與疑惑，以及未來研究的方向與重

perfect knowledge of whether or not the pulse is jammed. With 
PSI, the jammed pulse is disregard except when both pulses are 
jammed. 
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. A coherently 
detected JTIDS-type system model for the double-pulse 
structure with NNC is introduced in Section II.  The processes 
of investigating the SER performance of a coherently detected 
JTIDS-type waveform in both AWGN and PNI are discussed in 
Section III for three different cases: double-pulse structure, 
double-pulse structure with PSI, and double-pulse structure 
with NNC. Numerical results are presented in Section IV, and 
the major findings of this paper are concluded in the last 
section. 
II. SYSTEM MODEL DESCRIPTION 
The major processes required to generate a JTIDS-type 
waveform include RS encoding, symbols interleaving, 32-ary 
CCSK baseband symbol modulation, chip scrambling, MSK 
chip modulation, and frequency-hopping.  On the receiver side 
(see Figure 1), the process is the reverse of the transmission 
process.  After frequency de-hopping, MSK chip demodulation, 
and de-scrambling, each 5-bit channel symbol is recovered by a 
CCSK symbol demodulator.  The determination of which 5-bit 
channel symbol was received is accomplished by computing 
the cross-correlation between the de-scrambled 32-chip 
sequence and the 32 possible local sequences.  The decision is 
made by choosing the 5-bit symbol with the largest 
cross-correlation value [10].  After symbol de-interleaving, the 
channel symbols are decoded by a (n,k) RS decoder.  If the 
decoding is successful, the Link-16 message symbols are 
recovered. 
 
Fig. 1.  System model of a coherently detected JTIDS-type receiver. 
 
To reduce the degradation caused by PNI, a coherent MSK 
chip demodulator with noise-normalization diversity 
combining is assumed in the JTIDS receiver (Figure 2), where 
the input  represents the received 32-chip JTIDS 
waveform, and the output  represents the MSK demodulated 
32-chip sequence ready for de-scrambling.  
 r t
S
In Figure 2, we assume that the noise measurement circuit 
can accurately measure the noise power of each chip. The 
measured noise power is used to normalize the sampled output 
of the correlator for each chip of the first JTIDS pulse prior to 
soft-decision (SD) combing with each chip of the second 
JTIDS pulse in order to obtain the decision statistics. Since 
jammed chips are de-emphasized with respect to unjammed 
chips, this procedure minimizes the influence of jammed chips 
on the overall decision statistics.  Note that since each JTIDS 
pulse is only 6.4 sec  in duration, we assume that when one 
pulse is jammed, all 32-chips are jammed.

III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
The processes of investigating the SER performance of a 
coherently detected JTIDS-type waveform in both AWGN and 
PNI are discussed in this section for three different cases: the 
double-pulse structure, the double-pulse structure with PSI, and 
double-pulse structure with NNC.  
A. SER Performance of the double-pulse structure in both 
AWGN and PNI 
As mentioned earlier, JTIDS uses a (n,k) RS code for 
channel coding, where k represents information symbols and n 
represents coded (or channel) symbols.  A RS code is a linear, 
nonbinary block code. For a t-symbol error correcting, 
nonbinary block code, the probability of block (or decoder) 
error is upper bounded by

where the equality holds for either a perfect code or a bounded

probability of symbol error given that a block error has 
occurred is approximately i n  [11]. Using this approximation

occurred, the average probability of symbol error is given by

Similar results are obtained for the quadrature channel 
(bottom branch) of Figure 2. Now, using (3), (4), and (20) in (2) 
with 15 31r  , various  , and the values of 
jUB
 from Table I, 
we obtain the SER performance of a coherently detected 
JTIDS-type waveform for the double-pulse structure with NNC 
in both AWGN and PNI. 
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
The probability of symbol error for a coherently detected 
JTIDS-type waveform for the double-pulse structure with 
perfect side information in both AWGN and PNI are shown in 
Figures 3 and 4 where ' 0 3bE N  dB and 13 dB, respectively. 
To compare the differences between the double-pulse (DP) 
structure and the double-pulse structure with PSI, both results 
are shown in the figures for three different values of  .

From both Figures 3 and 4, several observations can be made. 
First, when ' 0bE N  is small (Figure 3), the performances 
obtained with perfect side information are poorer than those 
obtained without perfect side information when 'b IE N  is 
large.  This is consistent with our intuition that when ' 0bE N is 
not large, the receiver using perfect side information suffers 
due to throwing away the jammed pulse.  Second, when 
' 0bE N  is large (Figure 4), the performances obtained with 
perfect side information are superior to those obtained without 
perfect side information for the same  (except 1  ), and the 
superiority increases as the value of  decreases. Third,
