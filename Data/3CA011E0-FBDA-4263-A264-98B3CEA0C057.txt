Abstract
In this paper the design of a new quadruped
walking robot was first addressed. The legs of
the proposed quadruped robot, distinct from
traditional walking robots with jointed legs, was
designed by rotational axles. Each leg are
comprised of the coxa, femur, tibia and toe, and
actuated by two sets of gear trains. Thereafter,
the kinematics will be investigated to verify the
gravity center to be kept a level while walking.
To mimic quadruped animals, a central pattern
generator(CPG) was developed to generate the
walking patterns. Finally, an embedded control
system was used to implement the locomotion
control, and verify our developed model for the
CPG-based bio-mimetic behavior and
locomotion patterns.
KeyWords: quadruped walking robot, central
pattern generator, embedded control system.
二、緣由與目的
HE walking robot is always a hot field in the
robotics. The main reason is that the legs can
offer a feasible movement on irregular terrains.
The other one is about more detailed
understanding on the leg’s motion of the human
and animals through a legged robot. In order to
investigate animals’walking and running, even
the realization on the neural system,
bio-mechanics and motion principle of legs are
T
4the gear transmission mechanism , it is more
advantageous in waterproof and dustproof
compared to the general linkage jointed robot.
Moreover, the parallel mechanism for walking
is simple in structure, and may keep the gravity
center of the robot a level for a walking
locomotion. The whole mechanical structure of
the quadruped robot is shown in Fig. 2.
Walking Principle
As is well known, the walking of a
quadruped robot is a series of alternative
actuation of the legs. Also, each leg is at stance
or lifts up alternatively. Fig. 3 presents the
single leg actuation during lifting up. The motor
rotates the gear disc to drive the actuating bar,
and the actuating bar moves the coxa to rotate
about the axis A. Meanwhile, the femur rotates
about the axis B such that the proposed
quadruped robot can generate the walking
pattern.
Kinematic Analysis
In order to control the walking speed, the
relation of the input and output of the leg should
be developed. The leg design is equivalent to a
closed four linkage mechanism as shown in
Fig. 4(a), in which 2r is the radius of the gear
disc and 4r is the length of the coxa. The input is
the rotation angle 2 of the gear disc, and the
rotation angle 4of the coxa is defined as the
output. Based on the vector-loop analysis, the
relation of the input and output can be
represented in Fig. 4(b). It is seen that the
relation is almost linear. This relation will be
used for a control on the stride and walking
speed.
四. Control System
Hardware
The servo motor (KRS-4014HV ICS Red
Version of KONDO) used for the quadruped
walking robot has the maximum output torque
40.8 kg-cm and the maximal rotation angle
260°.
An embedded control system PSoC is used for
the controller core. The PSoC has some
advantages like the simplification on design of a
special peripheral circuit, low cost and shortened
development time. In this research the
Cy8c29466 chip (Cypress) with a working
frequency 24MHz is employed for the
development and control core of the digital
signal processing control system. In addition,
this PSoC chip can configure analogy module
and digital module flexibly.
Software Development
Since the PSoC is developed by Cypress, Inc.,
the control code for the quadruped robot must be
programmed based on the corresponding
software development tool whose application
program interface is shown in Fig. 5. In
addition, the Microsoft Visual Basic is used to
develop a user interface such that the quadruped
walking gait can be rapidly adjusted and
designed through RS232 and programmable
embedded chip communication.
五. Generation of Walking Pattern
Central Pattern Generato
A central pattern generator (CPG) results an
animal in an a feasible walking pattern which
is most appropriate walking speed. Experiments
also validate that the CPG exist in animals and
the generated locomotion very corresponds to
the observations on animals [11].
CPG is composed of a group of neurons
located at the central neural system [12]. For
now, it is an open topic in bio-robots to control a
robot so that the robot will have all types of
walking patterns and adaptive behaviors in
environment [13-15]. There are many CPG
6are controlled by the commands read from the
chip Cy8c29466 such that the quadruped
walking robot can be driven as desired, and then
the problems on gait generation and behavior
control can be investigated.
Based on the Matsuoka Model for the CPG, the
static stable gait will be implemented in the
designed quadruped walking robot. The program
for the gait is read into the embedded control
system to realize the bio-mimic walking. As
shown in Fig.8, a bio-mimic walking in the
static stable gait indeed can be achieved.
Moreover, it is observed that the gravity center
can remain level during the maneuver.
七. Conclusions
In this project, a new quadruped walking robot
whose gravity center can remain level during its
walking is developed. The Matsuoka
model-based CPG generates a static stable gait,
and the embedded control system PSoC is
employed to implements a bio-mimic
locomotion. The walking experiments
demonstrate that the new design on the
quadruped walking robot’s legs can always
keep a level for its gravity center. Moreover, the
motion controller using a bio-mimics indeed
provide an investigations into the bio-robots’
behaviors. Especially, the developed PSoC can
be applied to the autonomous robots or the other
advanced mechatronic system. In the future,
more bio-mimic behaviors
will be investigated in the quadruped robot
such that the bio-mimic behavior, neurology and
engineering technology can generate an
interaction.
