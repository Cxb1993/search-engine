the experimental analyses of TR and XPS, the electronic band structure near the fundamental 
band edge of Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) was thus constructed. The good correspondence of the TR

chalcopyrites.

二、緒論 
The research on solar energy material is an essential issue for utilization of sunlight on earth. The 
I-III-VI2 (I=Cu, III=In, Ga, Al, and VI=S, Se) family crystals are recently the subject of potential 
interest for application in photovoltaic solar cells due to their high absorption coefficient. To 
further improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency in the I-III-VI2-based solar cell, many low 
gap nanostructures such as CuInS2 nanospheres, CuInS2 nanocrystals and nanocomposite, and 
organic-inorganic hybrid nanocrystals of CuInSe2 were synthesized and fabricated to optimize the 
solar-cell performance by increasing total surface area available for light absorption. The other 
way to increase conversion efficiency is the construction of tandem (cascaded) solar cell by 
growing a series of I-III-VI2 family thin films with progressive band gaps to absorb step by step 
the wide energy range of radiation.  
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) belong to the I-III-VI2 family crystals formed by inter-substitution 
of the group III elements (Al and In) in the sulfide compounds. The chalcopyrite series covers the 
widest spectral range of energy gap ranging from ~1.5 eV (CuInS2) to ~3.5 eV (CuAlS2) which 
possesses the peak-absorption responses from near infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV) region. For 
a cascaded thin-film solar cell fabricated by Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1), CuInS2 may cover the NIR 
region, CuAlS2 should dominate the UV portion, and the intermediate compositions of 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0<x<1) may play an important role for optoelectronic conversion in the visible 
range. Moreover, a solar cell made from Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 is more environmentally friendly since it 
is free of Se. Before application of the chalcopyrites, a better understanding on the fundamental 
physical-chemical properties of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) is needed. The high-quality copper 
aluminum indium disulphide was hence necessary to be synthesized and grown for the crucial 
evaluation.  
In this report, a systematic study on growth and characterization of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) 
series crystals is reported. The solar energy crystals of Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) have been grown by 
chemical vapor transport (CVT) method using ICl3 as the transport agent. The experimental results 
indicated that the use of ICl3 is more effective than that of iodine transport in growing large 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) single crystals. Electronic structure and near-band-edge transitions of the 
 6
chemical transport. The reaction maintained for 300 hrs for producing large single crystals. After 
the growth, synthetic CuInS2, Cu(Al0.2In0.8)S2, Cu(Al0.4In0.6)S2, Cu(Al0.5In0.5)S2, Cu(Al0.6In0.4)S2, 
Cu(Al0.7In0.3)S2, and CuAlS2 showed a lot of needle-like single crystals that formed mirrorlike 
as-grown surfaces. Electron probe microanalysis showed a slight chalcogen deficiency in the 
crystals. The stoichiometric composition of the crystal approximately matches the original 
stoichiometry within a reasonable standard error. For simplicity, the value of x henceforth is 
defined by the nominal composition of the starting material. 
For X-ray measurements, several small crystals from each composition of the 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series were finely ground and the X-ray powder patterns were taken and 
recorded by means of a slow moving radiation detector. The copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) 
was employed in the X-ray diffraction measurements and a silicon standard was used for the 
experimental calibration. The lattice constant of each Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) compound with 
reasonable standard error was determined by least-square fits of a tetragonal equation using 
Jandel SigmaPlot mathematical software.  
TR experiments were carried out in a wide energy range of 1.25 to 6 eV. For the 
measurement of low-energy portion (E < 2 eV), a 150 W tungsten halogen lamp filtered by a PTI 
0.2 m monochromator provided the monochromatic light. A HUV2000B silicon photodiode was 
used for the optical detection. For E ≥ 2 eV, a 150 W xenon-arc lamp acted as the light source. 
The reflected light of the sample was detected by a photomultiplier tube and signal was recorded 
via an EG&G model 7265 dual phase lock-in amplifier. For thermal perturbation of sample, a 
quartz plate acted as the heat sink. The quartz plate was coated with a winding path of golden 
tracks for the heating element. The shape of the golden path was formed by a copper mask. The 
heating path consists of two wide tracks at the end sections and one narrow track lying in 
between them. The narrow track in the middle section is designed to act as a heat generation 
source when electrical current passes through the heater. The function of the wide track at the end 
sections is to speed up the heat dissipation when electrical power is off. Each thin sample of the 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 crystal with as-grown {112} face was closely attached on the narrow track of the 
Au path by silicone grease. Thermal modulations of the samples were achieved by indirect 
heating method of supplying current pulses to the Au heating element periodically. Heating pulses 
of low frequency and long duty cycle seem to be more efficient in the enhancement of spectral 
amplitude of the transition feature. Heat generation and dissipation from all the Au tracks and 
quartz substrate must be well balanced to avoid any increase of temperature in sample (i.e. weak 
heating disturbance). A 4 Hz square wave with the duty cycle of 50% is employed in the TR 
experiments. A RMC model 22 closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator equipped with a model 4075 
digital thermometer controller facilitates the low-temperature measurements.  
The XPS measurements were implemented by a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha system with a 
monochromatic Al Kα line source. The X-ray spot size in the system can be adjusted to 30~400

where iA and iφ  are the amplitude and phase of the line shape, and iE  and iΓ  are the 
energy and broadening parameter of the interband transitions in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series 
crystals. The fits yield transition energies indicated with arrows in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The 
variation of energies corresponding to particular interband transitions are also shown as dotted 
lines to illustrate their composition dependence. There are at least eight interband transitions 
denoted as EA, EB, EC, ED, EE, EF, EG, and EH detected in the low-temperature TR spectra of 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) at 30 K. The band gap of the chalcopyrite is determined by S p→p 
transition. For the valence band (EV) of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series, the degenerate S p-like 
Γ15 band splits into Γ4V and Γ5V located at the EV top due to uniaxial crystal field. For the 
conduction band, S p-like Γ1C is the lowest level. With increasing energies, the bands are in the 
order: Γ3C, Γ2C, and Γ5C, respectively. The EA and EB features in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series 
can be regarded as the band-edge exctionic transitions form Γ4V to the exciton level below 
conduction band (p state at Γ1C) starting from n=2 and from Γ5V → n=2 level of Γ1C, respectively. 
An extra excitonic transition A(n=3) at 3.55 eV can also be detected in the TR spectrum of CuAlS2 
at 30 K. It is originated from the transition of Γ4V → n=3 level at Γ1C. The EC feature in Fig. 4 
was also coming from the S p→p transition with energy value higher than band gap. The main 
valence band in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 chalcopyrite series was constructed by Cu 3d – S 3p 
hybridations. The incorporation of copper d orbital is the main difference between the band 
structures of a chalcopyrite and a zinc-blende crystal. In the case the transition metal incorporated 
in the chalcopyrites, the d electrons will split into t-dM(dxy, dxz, dyz) and e-dM( 2zd , 22 yxd − ) 
manifolds when replacing either cation of the host in the zinc blendes. For Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2, the p-d 
hybridation in EV causes the p-d repulsion, which reduces the band gap of the chalcopyrites 
relative to their II-VI zinc-blende analogs. The contribution of Cu d electron is hence a main part 
in EV, which will result in specific interband transition features observed in TR spectra. As shown 
in Fig. 4(b), the feature group of ED includes three transitions of 1ex )1(E d  (3.349 eV), 
2ex
)1(E d  (3.389 
eV), and ED (3.412 eV) observed in the TR spectrum of CuInS2 at 30 K. The three features are 
coming from the interband excitonic transitions originated from nonbonding Cu d orbital → S p

0.6, 0.7, and 1.0 at (a) 300 and (b) 30 K, respectively. The dashed curves are 
the experimental data and solid lines are those of the Lorentzian line-shape 
fits. The fits yield transition energies are indicated with arrows. 
 
The energy values of the interband transition features in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) can be analyzed 
by fitting the TR spectra to Eq. (2), which yields transition energies depicted in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) 
with representative error bars. The transition energies at 300 and 30 K are summarized in Table 1 
for comparison. Each of the transition features in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series reveals an 
energy blue-shift with the increase of Al concentration x shown in Fig. 5. The transition energies 
of the EA-EH features at 30 K are larger than those at 300 K due to the reduction of unit-cell size 
in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) chalcopyrite series. The EA and EB transitions are the band-edge 
transitions separated by crystal-field splitting (∆ = Γ4V - Γ5V) in the chalcopyrites. More accurate 
transition energies of EA and EB can be further analyzed by using previous polarization-dependent 
TR measurements. The energy difference of EB-EA shows an increase with increasing the Al 
content from x=0 to x=1 due to the enhancement of crystal-field splitting energy ∆ by changing 
the lattice constants in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 series. This result is due to the enhancement of uni-axial 
stress in the chalcopyrites with higher aluminum content. The compositional dependences of 
transition energies of the EA－EH features in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) can be described by the 
following expression:   
 
E(x) = E(0) + bx + cx2 (3). 
 
This relation is customarily used to express the composition-dependent gap energy for the 
direct band gaps in mixed III-V semiconducting compounds where c is the bowing parameter. 
The fitted results of transition energies of the EA－EH features are depicted as the solid lines 
shown in Fig. 5 and the obtained fitting parameters of E(0), b, and c are listed in Table 2 for 
comparison. The energy difference of E(0) at 300 and 30 K shows a smaller value for the EA, EB, 
EC, and EG features with respect to that of the ED, EE, EF, and EH features observed in each of the 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 element in Table 2. It lends an evidence that the two group of transitions are of 
different origins. The EA, EB, EC, and EG transitions are originated from the sulfur p→p 
“intra-atomic” transition, while the ED, EE, EF, and EH features may come from the copper 
d→sulfur p “inter-atomic” transition. The temperature-insensitive energy shift is a specific 
character for a transition with “intra-atomic” transition occurred inside the chalcopyrites. 
Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectra of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) chalcopyrite series in a wide 
energy range of 0 – 1300 eV. There are a lot of characteristic peaks detected in the XPS spectra of 
the chalcopyrites with x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 1.0, respectively. The origins for the

electrons (~ -18 eV). The main valence band is constructed by the hybridation of Cu 3d － S 3p 
states. There is one peak feature located at about –2.5 eV (CuInS2) to –2.2 eV (CuAlS2) in EV for 
the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 series with x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 1.0. This peak feature is correlated 
with the Cu 3d electrons in the valence band. The contribution of this peak feature can be evident 
from the group transitions of ED, EE, and EF features shown in TR measurements of Fig. 4 by Cu 
3d→S 3p* transitions. As shown in Fig. 7, the In-S and Al-S bonds are located below the d-p 
hybridation EV band and positioned at about -6 to -8 eV. The S 3s state locates at about –12 
to –14 eV and the nonbonding In 4d5/2 and 4d3/2 are positioned at about –17.3 and –18.1 eV, 
respectively. The spin-orbit splitting energy of the In 4d5/2－In 4d3/2 is ~ 0.8 eV. The energy of the 
In 4d5/2 is comparable with a previous CuInS2 thin film grown on Si (111) substrate. The intensity 
of the In 4d (In 4d5/2 and 4d3/2) peak in Fig. 7 also reveals gradual decrease with the increase of 
Al composition x from x=0 to x=1 in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 series. For CuAlS2, the In 4d peak was 
disappeared. This result is similar to the chemical analysis from In 3d and In 3p peaks observed 
in Fig. 6.

The chalcopyrite structure of I-III-VI2 can be regarded as a ternary analogue of the II-VI 
zinc blendes. The cation sublattice of the zinc blende is replaced by either group I or group III 
element in an ordered arrangement. For the band structure of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2, the inter

Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 with different Al compositions. The XPS spectra of 0-22 eV depicted the 
electronic structure near the valence band. Taking into account  the experimental analyses of 
XPS and TR measurements, a probable band scheme with suitable transition assignments in the 
quaternary chalcopyrites of Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 was thus constructed. The XPS, TR, and the proposed 
band diagram show good consistence in the electronic structure below valence band. It verifies 
the good quality for the as grown Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) single crystals.

β-In2S3 is a direct semiconductor reveals red color and transparent [11]. The 
band gap is about 1.935 eV at 300 K [11]. The intrinsic defects in β-In2S3 single 
crystal are sulfur vacancies VS (donor) [12], indium vacancies VIn (acceptor) [13], and 
indium interstitials IIn (donor) [12]. Because the existence of S vacancies and In 
interstitials, the β-In2S3 crystal can form easily the surface oxidation states of 
β-In2S3-3xO3x on its surface [14, 15]. The surface oxidation states formed by 
β-In2S3-3xO3x are a series of higher-energy levels with transition energies higher above 
band gap E0 of the β-In2S3. The energy range for the β-In2S3-3xO3x states may be a 
distribution from 1.935 eV for In2S3 to that of above 3 eV for In2O3. For 
optoelectronic conversion of the β-In2S3 crystal, the β-In2S3-3xO3x surface state will 
facilitate the optical conversion in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible range. Optical 
characterization of the below and above imperfection states in the β-In2S3 crystal is 
hence crucial and essential which needs to be explored. 
In this paper, optical properties of the imperfection states in β-In2S3 and 
β-In2S3:Nb crystals have been characterized by TR, PC, PL, SPR, transmittance and 
Photo V-I measurements. The defect transitions below the band edge of undoped 
β-In2S3 were identified by PL and PC measurements. The IB state of the β-In2S3:Nb 
crystals was detected by TR. The intensities of some specific surface-state transitions 
show significantly enhanced in the SPR spectra as compared to those in the traditional 
 6
c=32.331Å for undoped β-In2S3, a=7.606 and c=32.291Å for β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and 
a=7.599Å and c=32.252 Å for β-In2S3:Nb0.01, respectively. The experiments of TR [9, 
16], PC [17], and PL [11] measurements were respectively carried out. The 
experimental procedures were described elsewhere. For SPR measurements, a thin 
sheet-type sample was closely attached on a cooper sample holder by indium or silver 
paste. A cooper mesh contacts the sample surface by In, which is the top electrode of 
the measurement. The electric field of the SPR was applied normal to the {100} 
surface between the top and bottom electrodes. A load resistor R (100 kΩ) connected 
in series with the sample was used for sensing the photocurrent [14]. A closed-cycle 
cryogenic refrigerator equipped with a thermometer controller facilitated the 
low-temperature measurement.  
For optical-absorption study, measurement of transmittance was implemented at 
near-normal incidence. Transmission intensity was closely monitored to obtain an 
incidence as close to 90° as possible. DC photoconductivity (PC) and 
photo-current-voltage (Photo I-V) measurements were carried out using two different 
white-light sources as the solar emulator. One is the commercialized InGaN-based 
phosphorus white-light light emitting diode array (denoted as white LED) and the 
other is a tungsten halogen lamp (denoted halogen lamp). The white LED covered a 
wide spectral range from visible to IR portion with two hump peaks centered at ~450 
 8
values of E0 are 1.935, 1.923, and 1.901 eV for undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and 
β-In2S3:Nb0.01, respectively. They correspond to the red-light portion for the crystal 
colors. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the thin-slab β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and 
β-In2S3:Nb0.01 crystals show fresh red, red to dark-red colors with the increase of the 
Nb content. This result verifies the band-gap reduction behavior in the highly 
Nb-incorporated In2S3 compounds. The reason why band-gap reduction occurred with 
the increase of Nb is due to the contribution of metallic property of pure NbS2 (i.e. no 
band gap). The EVS feature in Fig. 1 was a defect transition from valence band (EV) → 
S vacancies (VS) below the conduction band edge (EC). The TR amplitudes of E0 
show increase with the increase of the Nb content in the β-In2S3:Nb crystals. It is 
about fifteen times for β-In2S3:Nb0.01 with respect to that of the undoped β-In2S3 
shown in Fig. 1. This result shows that the photon’s absorption yield increases with 
the increase of Nb content owing to the rising density in IB state.  
For the characterization of below and above band-edge imperfection states in 
undoped β-In2S3, PC, SPR, and PL measurements were respectively carried out. The 
low-temperature PC and SPR spectra of β-In2S3 at 30 K are presented in Fig. 2. The 
inset depicts the measurement arrangement of the PC and SPR experiments. The main 
difference between the PC and SPR measurements is the dissimilarity of the 
electric-field directionε. The SPR isε// k and PC isε⊥ k, where k is the optical 
 10
temperature dependency of energy shift for the four above-band-edge transitions E0, 
ox
LE , 
ox
1E , and 
ox
HE . This result verifies that the 
ox
LE , 
ox
1E , and 
ox
HE  features are 
the band-to-band transitions coming from the surface oxidation states of β-In2S3-3xO3x. 
The above band-edge transitions of oxLE , 
ox
1E , and 
ox
HE  are not inferred to come 
from the dangling bonds that formed by vacancies or interstitials. The dangling bonds 
formed by vacancies or interstitials are not sensitive to the thermal expansion of 
lattice when the temperature is changed. The oxHE  may come from the outer layer of 
the surface oxide of the β-In2S3-3xO3x, in which the oxidation state contains higher 
oxygen (higher x value) and hence possesses higher transition energy. As shown in 
Fig. 3(a), the E0′ feature at ~2.12 eV was insensitive to the energy shift when the 
temperature was changed. It may come from a band-to-band transition from the other 
k direction, or a defect transition from EV to a defect level (above EC) formed by 
sulfur vacancies [12].  
To verify the above-band-edge transitions in undoped β-In2S3 crystal, PL 
measurements for a surface polished and a surface unpolished sample were 
respectively carried out at 300 K. The dashed lines shown in Fig. 4 are the 
experimental PL spectra of a polished and an unpolished β-In2S3. The solid lines are 
the least-square fits using Lorentzian function. The energy locations of the Ed1, Eds, E0, 
and ox1E  emission peaks are 1.518, 1.572, 1.935, and 2.19 eV at 300 K, respectively. 
 12
β-In2S3:Nb0.005 and β-In2S3:Nb0.01 The inset of Fig. 5(a) also shows an enhanced 
change between the white LED and halogen lamp occurred in the heavily Nb doped 
sample of β-In2S3:Nb0.01, i.e. an improvement in photosensitivity in the NIR region. 
To further evaluate the current-voltage characteristic of the IB related β-In2S3:Nb, 
photo V-I measurements of a β-In2S3:Nb0.01 photoconductor were carried out at 300 K. 
Fig. 5(b) shows the photo V-I curves for the β-In2S3:Nb0.01 under different light 
sources’ illuminations. The solid lines are the least square fits of the V-I data to an 
expression of I=I0+G⋅V, where G is the photoconductance (A/V). The obtained values 
of photoconductance are G=7.1×10-8 (A/V) with halogen lamp, G=1.2×10-8 (A/V) 
with white LED, and G=1.4×10-9 (A/V) under the dark condition. The enhanced 
photoelectric-conversion yield may occur in the visible-NIR region for the 
β-In2S3:Nb0.01 crystal with high density intermediate band. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Single crystals of undoped β-In2S3, β-In2S3:Nb0.005, and  β-In2S3:Nb0.01 were 
successfully grown by CVT method. The below-band-edge defect transitions of Ed1 
and Eds (occurred by sulfur vacancies VS → Indium vacancies VIn) were detected in 
undoped β-In2S3 using PL. The above-band-edge oxidation states of oxLE , ox1E , and
