Since the long wave length modes (i.e., small wave
number ) may introduce flow instability to meet our
analysis objectives, the dimensionless stream function 

By plugging the above two equations into Eqs. (17)-(22),
the system governing equations can then be collected and
solved order by order. In practice, the non-dimensional
surface tension S is a large value, the term S2 can
be treated as a quantity of zeroth order [7-9]. For
hRr  , the film thickness h is very small, so it can
obtain the power series approximation solutions up to the

function , 0 and 1. By plugging the solutions for the
equations of both the zeroth and the first orders into the

We employ linear and nonlinear hydromagnetic stability
theories to conduct a numerical characterization of thin
electrically conductive film flows traveling down a
vertical column. The normal mode approach is first used
to compute the linear stability solution for the film flow.
The method of multiple scales is then used to obtain the
weak nonlinear dynamics of the film flow for stability
analysis. The deriving process as well as the derived
results have been presented in previous work [7].
3. Numerical examples
A numerical example is presented here to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed modeling procedure in
dealing with the problem of a thin electrically conductive
viscoelastic fluid film flowing down along a vertical
cylinder in a magnetic field. Based on the modeling
results, the condition for thin-film flow stability can now
be expressed as a function of Reynolds number, Re ,
dimensionless perturbation wave number,  ,
dimensionless radius of cylinder, R, viscoelastic
parameter, k, and Hartmann number, m. In order to study
the influence of the Hartmann number, viscoelastic
parameter, and radius of the cylinder on the stability of
the film flow, a constant dimensionless surface tension
( S = 6173.5) is used throughout for all numerical
computations [8, 9].
3.1 Linear stability solutions
The neutral stability curve is obtained by
computing the conditions of linear stability for a linear
amplitude growth rate 0id . The stability of flow field
(- Re plane) is separated into two different regions by
the neutral curve. In the linearly stable sub-critical region,
the perturbed small waves decay as the perturbation time
period increases. However, in the linearly unstable
supercritical region, the perturbed small waves grow as
the perturbation time period increases. Figure 1 shows the
linear neutral stability curves (dash lines) of the
electrically conductive viscoelastic film flow. The results
indicate that the area of linearly unstable region )0( id
becomes larger for a decreasing m, an increasing k, and a
decreasing R. Figure 2 show the temporal film growth
rate of electrically conductive viscoelastic fluid with
different m values. It is interesting to note that temporal
film growth rate increases as the values of m decrease. In
addition, the results show that temporal film growth rate
increases as the values of R decrease and the values of k
