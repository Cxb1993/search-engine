Introduction
Surface water used for drinking should be safe, meaning it is free
from odor, taste, color, and pathogens and does not contain chemicals at
concentrations that can cause harm. In order to attain high quality
drinking water a range of treatment technologies can be used including
membrane filtration, coagulation, ozonation, ion exchanger resins and
disinfection by chlorine. (Leeuwen et al, 2004)
Coagulation is a general process used in drinking water system and
it has good performance in removing turbidity and color from raw water.
that relate raw water quality parameters (ultraviolet light absorbing
compounds, color, turbidity and the pH of raw water) to dose rates of the
coagulants such as alum and ferric chloride. The isotherm defining
sorptive equilibrium between DOC and the hydroxide surface is
assumed to depend only on the type of coagulant and the final pH.
Although this equilibrium might be described by a variety of approaches
including Freundlich, Langmuir, or diffuse-layer modeling, more than 50
preliminary trials with each approach pointed to the Langmuir isotherm
as the most promising. (Edwards, 1997)
Kastl et al (2002a) hypothesized that DOC removal between pH 5 and 7
can be explained by considering only two fractions: the sorbable fraction
(which comprises weak acid groups) and the nonsorbable fraction. In
this model, it is assumed that dissociated and associated forms of
sorbable compounds are adsorbed with different affinities and that DOC
removal follows a Langmuir isotherm. (Kastl et al, 2004) As the study by
Kastl et al (2004), if initial DOC is described as DOC0, then:
DOCha,0 + DOCnonpolar,0 + DOCnonsorb = DOC0
In this research, the coagulation process has been used as a
primary process in treating source water. Although general factors that
influence DOC removal during coagulation are now relatively well
understood, their complex interplay has hindered formulation of models.
In this study, the relation between DOC removal and the character of
DOC (like hydrophobic, hydrophilic) was considered to understand
clearly about the mechanism during coagulation, and then develop a
predicting model of DOC removal.
Material and Methods
The chemicals used whether in experiments or for analyses are
listed in Table.
resin experiment. After separating hydrophilic and hydrophobic portion of
NOMs by resin, analyze the DOC of the samples and calculated the
mass of organic carbon in the two portions.
Resin process
XAD-8 resin is aliphatic polymer matrices of acrylic ester, and the
sorptive rate for humic solutes was rapid on XAD-8; it exhibited the
highest sorptive capacity for humic solutes, and the XAD-8 resin yielded
essentially 100 percent recovery of sorbed humic substances with no
specific sorption (Malcolm, 1991). In this research, XAD-8 resin was
replaced by DAX-8, which has the similar characters.
Resin preparing
1. Transfer the dry resin to a 500Ml beaker. Add sufficient methanol to
cover the resin bed by 5 cm.
2. Stir the resin gently for a minute to ensure complete mixing. Allow the
material to stand for 15 minutes.
3. Carefully decant most of the methanol and replace it with distilled
water. Stir the mixture, and then allow it to stand for 10 minutes.
Follow the column preparation instructions below.
NOMs separated process
1. Filter source water through the 0.45 um filters.
2. Adjust pH of sample to 2 with 6N HCl in order to protonate the humic
substance to an uncharged state.
3. Pump the acidified sample into DAX-8 resin
4. The effluent from DAX-8 was hydrophilic NOMs
5. Desorb hydrophobic NOMs with 0.1 N NaOH
Results and Discussion
1 Performance Evaluation by Alum and Ferric Chloride
Alum and ferric chloride are widely used as coagulants in water and
coagulant dose (100 mg/L). This is because at lower pH level, the
concentration of strong positive charge ion (like Al3+ and Al(OH)2+) were
formed more than that at higher pH level. The addition of positive ions in
the water samples can compress the diffuse layer of particles, reduce
the zeta-potential and then enhance the turbidity removal as shown in
Figure 1-4.

levels of dose and pH, treated with (a) alum, treated with (b) ferric chloride

Nature Organic Matters (NOMs) Removal by Enhanced Coagulation
Nature organic matters (NOMs) in source water from Tai-Lake were
higher than most water reservoir lakes in Taiwan. The DOC in source
water from Tai-Lake was measured around 8.5 mg/L, and alkalinity was
measured 90 mg/L as CaCO3. According to the requirement of DOC
removal for enhanced coagulation in the US EPA’s D/DBP rules, 40% of
DOC removal was required. However, the SUVA of raw water in Tai-Lake
is 1.1±0.1 L/mg-m, which can be exempt from D/DBP rules when the
SUVA of raw water is smaller than 2 L/mg-m as suggested by guidance
coagulation process. When operated pH to 5, the PODR was reached
when ferric chloride was fed at 60 mg/L. By increasing the dosage to
100mg/L, 41% of DOC removal percentage was obtained, which means
the US EPA’s D/DBP rules could be reached when treated source water
with 100 mg/L of ferric chloride at pH 5. However, the dosage which is
more than PODR (60mg/L) is considered uneconomic and with no
efficiency.
Figure1-7 Performance of DOC removal during coagulation measured at various
levels of ferric chloride dose and pH
The specific UV absorbance (SUVA =100×[UV254(cm
-1)/DOC(mg/L)])
is an important index denoting characters of NOMs in source water. In
Figures 1-8 and 1-9, it was observed the value of SUVA was decreased
with increasing of dosages, which indicates that the DOC removed by
coagulation mostly belongs to which can absorb UV254 light.
As shown in Figure 1-8, when treated source water at lower pH level
5, the value of SUVA could be reduced from 1.095 to 0.909 (L/mg-m).
Figure1-8 The value of SUVA measured at various level of coagulant dose and pH, (a)
treated with alum, (b) treated with ferric chloride
Figure 1-10 presents the comparing of the performances between
removing turbidity, DOC and SUVA by treating source water with various
levels of ferric chloride dose. It can be observed that when treated
source water with more than 80 mg/L of ferric chloride and pH operated
in the range from 5 to 7, the residual turbidity could be reduced under 0.5
NTU, and the value of SUVA also could be reduced to under 1 L/mg-m
under the same condition.
be reached when treated with 100 mg/L of ferric chloride at pH 5, which
was fitted to the requirement in US EPA’s D/DBP rules; Hence, It could
be seen as the optimum coagulation design when treated source water
with 100 mg/L of ferric chloride and operated pH to 5.
Empirical model
It can be observed that when treating source water with a given
dose, like 60 mg/L of alum dose as the dotted line shown in Figure 4-1-9,
different DOC removal percentage could be reached with various levels
of pH. The relationship between DOC removal percentage and
operated pH were shown in the right side of Figures 4-1-9 and 4-1-10.
The DOC removal percentage could be approximated by polynomial
functions of pH as followed:
Pr = -A × ln( pH ) + B (4-1)
where Pr is the percentage of removal DOC,“A”and“B”are variables.
Equation (1) should be gave a boundary of pH levels (from 5 to 9) to
avoid infulence the dissolution of coagulants. Table 1-2 shows the results
of Equation (1) fitted by the experimental data obtained from the source
water treated by alum and ferric chloride
For reaching a specific DOC removal percentage, Equation (1) can
help to optimize the operated pH level when treated source water with a
constant coagulant dose; beside, it was observed that the variables “A”
and “B”changed with the changing of adding dose, which can be
discribed as Equations (2) and (3).
A = c1 × D
2 + d1 × D + e1 (2)
B = c2 × D
2 + d2 × D + e2 (3)
where“ci”,“di”and“ei”are fitting constants for variables“A”and“B”,
and D is the adding dose. Table 1-3 shows the results of Equations (2)
and (3) fitted by variables“A”and“B”in various levels of coagulant dose.
Variables “A”and “B”can be solved if the constants “ci”, “di”and “ei”
Reduction of Chlorine Demand and THMFP
The most important purpose of enhanced coagulation is the
reduction of disinfection by-products. Effective coagulation should be
able to remove the organic precursors in water, and remove the
possibility of DBP formation. According to the previous discussion, when
treated source water with alum and ferric chloride, the best DOC
removing performance could be obtained at the adding dose of 100 mg/L
and at operated pH of 5. Therefore, the THM formation reduction of
source water treated by alum and ferric chloride at the best conditions
was discussed in this section.

Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Fraction of DOC Removed During
Coagulation
Tables 2-1 and 2-2 present the results of hydrophilic and
hydrophobic DOCs in sample waters, which were pretreated by alum
and ferric chloride coagulants at various levels of coagulant dose and
operated at pH 5 and 9, respectively. The recoveries of organic carbon
throughout resin experiments were observed from 90% to 130% which
means the requirement of QA/QC.
Tables 2-1 list the result of resin experiments which were pretreated
by alum operated at pH 5 and 9. It can be observed that when alum dose
reached to 100 mg/L at pH 5, the DOC removed 0.87 mg of organic
carbon (from 2.54 to 1.67mg) during coagulation, and the hydrophilic
DOC was removed from 1.19 to 0.92 mg which was only accounted for
31% in total removal DOC. When pH was operated at 9 with the alum
dose from 20 to 100 mg/L as shown in Table 2-1 (b), the hydrophilic DOC
was founded from 0.91 to 0.93 mg, which indicated that there is no
significant reduction of hydrophilic DOC at this pH level.
Similar findings were also observed in Table 2-2 (a), which indicates
that 0.15 mg of hydrophilic DOC equivalent to 19 % of total removal
DOC was removed when source water treated by 100 mg/L ferric

Figure 2-2 shows residual fraction of hydrophilic DOC at a various
level of coagulant dose. It was clearly observed that the removal of
hydrophilic NOMs demonstrate significant difference in pH 5 and 9,
which hydrophilic DOC could not be removed at pH 9, but could be
removed at pH 5. This observation could be explained by that the DOC
removal mechanism in hydrophilic is charge neutralization. At lower pH
level, the hydrolysis of alum or ferric chloride generates strong positive
charge ions (like Al3+ and Fe3+) which could react with the negative
charge of hydrophilic NOMs to form the chemical precipitation.
Hydrophilic DOC was removed throughout this coagulation mechanism.
However, when pH increasing, the products of hydrolysis became
weaker positive charge and then the function of charge neutralization
was lower. This phenomenon was clearly demonstrated in Figure 2-3
(a) alum
(b) ferric chloride
Figure 2-2 The residual fraction of hydrophilic DOC at various levels of coagulant
doses and pH, where (a) is alum, (b) is at ferric chloride
As suggested by Edzwald (1999), after charge neutralization, the
complexation will be reduced by adsorption on aluminum hydroxide
solids. It means that no matter charge neutralization or adsorption, the
process of removal DOC can be considered as a sorptive equilibrium
general, the humic and non-humic groups are the related to the
hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOC, respectively, and the non-humic
groups are including transphilic acid, protein, amino acid and
carbohydrate. The humic groups are primarily from humic and fulvic acid
with the functional groups of phenolic and carboxylic.
Figure 2-4 shows the UV light absorption of hydrophobic (2.5mg/L)
and hydrophilic (2.8mg/L) DOCs measured by the wave lengths from
240 to 265 nm, where the samples were obtained by separating the
source water from Tai-Lake. It was observed that UV254 absorption by
hydrophobic DOC was higher than that by hydrophilic DOC, which is due
to the specific functional groups such as carboxylic and phenolic in
hydrophobic are highly detected by UV254. With this evidence, it implies
that the portion of hydrophobic NOMs increases with increasing of value
of SUVA.
In this research, Rphobic denoted of hydrophobic portion in NOMs and
defined as Equation (4):
Rphobic = hydrophobic DOC / total DOC (4)
With the above discussion, the relationship between SUVA and
Rphobic could be observed as shown in Figure 2-5, which was plotted
according to the data presented in Appendix B-2 (n=20). A correlation
between SUVA and Rphobic was observed as followed Figure 2-5:
Rphobic = 0.534 × SUVA
0.361 R2=0.882 (5)
This equation were gave a boundary in Rphobic and SUVA, where the
range were from 0.426 to 0.626 and from 0.5 to 1.3, respectively. In the
further research, higher and lower level of SUVA of source water should
be measured to figure out the relationship between Rphobic and SUVA in
boundary level.
formed, and used to predict DOC removal during coagulation. In this
research, the chemical characters of DOC were identified and then
introduced to develop the Di-components model.
Kastl’s Model for Predicting DOC Removal during Coagulation
Kastl’s model (2004) is based on the Langmuir isotherm. Five
coefficients (fha, fnonpolar, a, b and Ka) are needed to be determined to
establish in Kastl’s model. In addition, there are three variables, i.e.
coagulant dose, coagulation pH, and the final DOC, in the model. If any
two values are given, then the third can be determined.
Table 3-1 and Figures 3-1 and 3-2 provide the results obtained from
fitting Kastl’s model to source water. With respect to the filled parameters
shown in Table 3-1, the alum coagulant possesses better performance
than the ferric chloride. The slopes of two coagulants are both very close
to 1, which means the predicted DOC are close to measured ones as
shown in Figures 3-1 and 3-2; however, in comparison of 95%
confidence interval and the Standard errors, the alum exhausts a
relatively accurate prediction than the ferric chloride.

in Tai-Lake is higher than that in the US rivers list in Table 3-2, which
means that the DOC in Tai-Lake is relatively hard to remove by
coagulation. Moreover, the “nonpolar groups”observed in alum and
ferric chlorides are apparently the same.
Table 3-2 also shows that“humic acid groups”removed by alum are
slightly different from those removed by ferric coagulant. Comparing the
fha values associated with ferric chloride and alum in Table 3-2, it can be
observed that values of fha for alum were consistently below those for
ferric chloride, which indicates that alum affinity with “humic acid groups
“isweaker than that with ferric chloride (Kastl, 2004).
Hence, the fnonsorb values for alum are higher than those for ferric
chloride; it means that ferric chloride is more effective than alum when
removing DOC from treated water by coagulation. As the result, the
DOC removal percentage can be reached to 41% when treated source
water from Tai-Lake by ferric chloride, and only 37% of DOC removal
percentage could be reached by alum.

However, when fit the Kastl’s model with Tai-Lake data, there was a
relatively large discrepancy between the predicted and measured DOC,
where the R2 for ferric chloride is 0.856, and the value of standard errors
is ±7%.
(1997), the affinity of DOC on the hydroxide surface and the number of
surface sites available for adsorption are highly dependent upon the pH
value of the water sample. It means that the coefficient “a”can be
described as a function of pH. In this research, coeficients “a” in 
hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups were different:
21)( xpHxa chydrophobi  (18)

3)( xpHxpHxa chydrophili  (19)

According to the Equations (20) and (21), the Di-components model
is applicative in series levels of pH and dosage, i.e. 5~9 and 20~100
(mg/L), respectively. In addition, the Empirical and Kastl’s models are
also can be used to predicted residual DOC in series levels of pH and
dosage.
The characteristic of source water can be changed by the climates
and creatures. These changes can significantly influence the accuracy of
removal DOC predicting. For the Kastl’s model, the source water
considerably changes its characteristics then a modified set of
coefficients may need to be derived from a new set of jar tests, however,

It was observed that there were about 40% hydrophilic and 60%
hydrophobic portions in DOC at the Tai-Lake source water.Since the
hydrophobic DOC can be removed during coagulation process, and the
hydrophilic can not. This implies the hydrophilic DOC removal
mechanism is “charge neutralization”, and the hydrophobic DOC 
removal mechanisms are “charge neutralization” and “adsorption”. The 
relationship between SUVA and Rphobic the portion of hydrophobic in
DOC could be described as following:
Rphobic = 0.534 × SUVA
0.361
In this research, Kastl’s model was modified by additional 
characterization of hydrophilic and hydrophobic DOC, the
Modified-Kastl’s model fits experimental data wel (R2 of 0.90 and 0.91,
