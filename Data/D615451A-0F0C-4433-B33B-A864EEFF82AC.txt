other principal plane of incidence φinc = 85.5o. As stated earlier, full graphical results and details of the 
discussions are found in the Appendix herein. 
 
This work has thus investigated the effects of various parameters of AMC structures comprising split-ring 
resonator (SRR) metallizations on the high-impedance bandwidth and resonant frequencies. Through these 
studies, insights into the roles played by these parameters may be gained, which could then facilitate proper 
designs of AMC structures and judicious selections of appropriate SRR geometries to be put into 
advantageous use in numerous antenna applications. Upcoming tasks could be, in addition to the performing 
the same investigations herein on other metallic shapes, to also use these findings as the characterization 
groundwork for the analysis and design of cavity-resonant antennas with enhanced gain involving partially-
reflective surfaces and reflectarrays. 
 
 
2. Square Metallic Patch-Array-Etched Dielectric Cover over Open Waveguide Arrays: 
Direct-Radiating Phased Arrays and Focal Plane Array Feeds for Reflectors 
 
A vital branch of our research that was also drawn up in our preceding project proposal is on focal plane 
array (FPA) feeds for reflector antennas. Conventional single-horn or even cluster feeds suffer from several 
disadvantages, such as aberrational errors and distortions due to large off-axis scan angles and poor 
continuity of coverage. This problem, however, can be well circumvented by a dense FPA feed with small 
element spacings. As such, the illumination properties can be controlled by the beamforming network rather 
than the aperture size of each element. This is a major strength of FPA feeds. 
 
In this research category, we have studied an FPA comprising hard rectangular waveguide elements, which 
are constitutionally suitable for sampling the focal plane fields due to their ideal uniform aperture fields. 
Full mutual coupling analysis of the FPA had been performed using advanced Fourier concepts of arrays. 
As a result, in addition to the usual reflector subefficiencies (spillover, illumination, polarization, phase, 
blockage), we have mooted in a pioneering way, a further vital figure-of-merit that characterizes the true 
performance of the FPA: the so-called decoupling efficiency. This measures the power losses due to mutual 
coupling amongst the array elements, which will always exist even if ideal lossless materials are assumed. 
Hence, together with the classical radiation efficiency quantifying only ohmic and dissipation losses, the 
decoupling efficiency provides the true complete characterization of the losses in array antennas. This last 
factor has often been neglected by the scientific community. The product of these two efficiencies produces 
the total radiation efficiency, which together with the other usual reflector subefficiencies, yields the total 
efficiency of the entire FPA-fed system. 
 
There had never been any trace of investigations into the matching of FPAs. Therefore, it is important to 
explore the advantages of using periodic metallic elements etched onto dielectric slabs as array covers for 
serving as matching layers. We had initially aimed at peering into the prospects of using SRR-arrays printed 
on dielectric slabs and placed over waveguide arrays as a matching layer to achieve improved transmission. 
However, it would be prudent to, before plunging into this special metallic element-shape, first investigate 
the more basic, simpler element shape – the rectangular metallic patch. The results obtained for this case 
would then serve as the reference for the more unusual SRR-metallization. In other words, it provides 
comparison between the SRR-configuration under investigation, which is essential for making proper sense 
of the results that we shall find later on.

disparate locations, each taking care of a certain band. To possess this attribute is vital for applications in 
modern-day handheld devices where “real estate” for antenna placement is scarce. All the results obtained in 
this work have been simulated with CST Microwave Studio and validated with measurements of return loss 
as well as gain in an anechoic chamber and radiation efficiency in a reverberation chamber. 
 
Before proceeding, we highlight that this work has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions 
on Antennas and Propagation [1]. Salient excerpts from that journal submission are hereby presented.  
Initial simulations of a pair of concentric SRRs (ground-shorted) indeed demonstrated the preconceived 
dual-band property, thereby validating the concept. A rigorous parametric study was also conducted. The 
parameters investigated are the relative size of the double-SRR with respect to the unit cell, and the 
thickness and permittivity of the dielectric substrate. Results showed that when the relative size of the rings 
is increased the operation frequencies decrease, as expected. As the thickness of the substrate increases, the 
upper and lower resonance frequencies fall considerably. This same trend occurs for the permittivity. This 
concurs with well known characteristics of traditional patches, whose operation frequencies are such that 
some dimension of the printed part of the antenna is approximately a multiple of λ/2 in the material used as 
substrate. A prototype was manufactured and measured for its S11 frequency response and radiation patterns. 
The dual-band functionality was experimentally verified successfully and the radiation patterns exhibit good 
isotropy. 
 
 
Self-Evaluation of the Project and Concluding Remarks 
 
This NSC project had been successfully carried out, producing a substantial amount of research output and 
decent number of publications [1] – [4]. The main objectives and goals originally laid out have been 
adequately satisfied. In addition to converting the fruits of the first two subprojects into journal articles, of 
which the second one is already prepared and ready for submission soon, what remains are further 
extensions of these research ideas and directions, in virtue of the promising outlook which this project has 
painted. It is believed that this project has paved the way for more important investigations into the areas of 
metamaterials and as inspiration for novel microstrip antennas with improved performance in terms of 
multifunctionality and compactness.

The ratio of the specularly reflected wave to the incident plane wave calculated at the array surface is called 
the dominant-mode reflection coefficient, or simply, reflection coefficient, in most occasions. It will 
henceforth just be referred to as the latter in the present context. Since the fields of both these waves have 
all three x, y and z components in general, a dyadic reflection coefficient is involved. Specifically, there is a 
particular reflection coefficient Γξη that relates a certain component, ξ of the reflected field to a certain 
component, η of the incident field. Hence, a 3 by 3 matrix constitutes the dyadic reflection coefficient, of 
which the 9 elements are the constituent reflection coefficients. In the present work, this Γξη typically only 
refers to the ratio of the electric field components that are tangential to the array surface, i.e. Γxx or Γyy. 
 
When a TEz polarized plane wave traveling in the xz (φinc = 0) plane is incident on the periodic structure (see 
Fig. 1a), the y-directed incident E-field results in a specularly reflected E-field that is also purely y-directed. 
As such, the only relevant reflection coefficient is Γyy. It can then be deduced that a Γxx pertains to a TEz 
polarized incident plane wave in the yz (φinc = 90o) plane. Conversely, a Γxx is relevant to a TMz polarized 
plane wave in the xz (φinc = 0) plane, since both the incident and reflected E-fields only have x and z 
components (the incident and reflected H-fields are purely y-polarized); likewise, a TMz polarized plane 
wave in the xz (φinc = 90o) plane (x directed incident H-field) leads to a Γyy of interest. It is reiterated that the 
Γξη is an E-field ratio.

It is noted that the gap of the split ring that is numerically solved by the moment method code is cut along 
the x-axis, as it appears in Fig. 1c. Due to this asymmetry, the incident plane wave affects the structure 
differently even between the cases of φinc = 0 and 90o (for a square cell, there will generally be a difference 
between two values of φinc that are neither of these two principal values, even if the metal elements are 
symmetric, e.g. square and circular patches or loops). The frequency range of 1 to 16 GHz is investigated in 
all the upcoming computed results. 
 
a. Slab thickness 
 
The slab thickness is the first parameter that is varied for a certain fixed set of the other parameters. Fig. 2 
contains several graphs of the reflection-phase against frequency for TEz incidence. Each graph pertains to 
one of the possible 9 angles of incidence, defined by a certain pair of (φinc, θinc), as listed in Table I. Within 
each plot, the variations of the reflection-phase with frequency for three slab thicknesses are shown – those 
stated in Table I. Each of the other constant parameters, being the relative permittivity of the slab, gap angle, 
and ring-cell ratio, takes on the second value given in the above table. 
 
As seen from Fig. 2, a phenomenon common to all incidence angles is that, as the slab gets thinner, the 
high-impedance bandwidth decreases and the resonant frequency increases. Another observation is that, for 
any particular azimuthal plane of incidence φinc, i.e., a certain row of plots in Fig. 2, the behaviors for all 
slab thicknesses do not vary significantly as θinc increases from 0 to around 45o, but the deviations increase 
rapidly as θinc rises further towards grazing incidence. Therefore, the high-impedance performance is fairly 
independent of elevation angle, so long as the incidence is not close to grazing. This constitutes an 
advantage to practical applications. 
 
For φinc = 0.5o, there are two resonant frequencies occurring within the investigated frequency band from 1 
to 16 GHz. On the other hand, there is only one resonance for φinc = 85.5o. For the φinc = 0.5o case, the lower 
of the two resonant frequencies for every slab thickness (ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 GHz) is lower than the sole 
resonant frequency of the φinc = 85.5o case, for all its three cases of thickness (being 7.5, 10, and 12 GHz). 
This can be explained as follows. The resonant frequency is known to be inversely proportional to both the 
capacitance and inductance. Therefore, the dominantly y-directed incident electric field for the φinc = 0.5o 
case increases the capacitive effect of the gap, thus reducing the resonant frequency. On the other hand, this 
enhanced capacitive effect is not achieved by the other plane of incidence. 
 
Although the mild changes with elevation angle between 0 and 45o as mentioned earlier, they are still 
existent and are described as follows. For φinc = 85.5o with only one resonance in the investigated band, as 
θinc increases, the high-impedance bandwidth decreases and the resonant frequency increases for all three

Fig. 6b: Variation of reflection-phase with frequency for the SRR-type AMC under TE incidence, with strip-width as the 
parameter within each subplot pertaining to a certain angle of incidence, (φinc = 88.5o,  θinc). The phase of Γxx is thus used. 
 
As seen from Figs. 6a and 6b, the resonant frequency and high-impedance bandwidth of the first resonance 
increases with increasing strip-width. This holds also for the unusual resonances of the φinc = 0.5o case (Fig. 
6a) occurring at around 5 to 6 GHz (preceding the ordinary-looking first resonance) for all strip-widths. For 
the second resonance, however, the resonant frequency does not change considerably as the strip-width gets 
thicker, holding true for both φinc planes and all θinc cases. With close scrutiny, there may be indications that 
the resonant frequency falls with increasing thickness instead. The decrease in bandwidth of the second 
resonance with increasing strip-width is more pronounced though, apparent for both φinc planes. In the same 
way as for earlier-investigated parameters, the early-occurring resonance at around 5 GHz for the φinc = 0.5o 
case (Fig. 6a) is due to the increased capacitance caused by the gap, leading to lowered resonant 
frequencies. 
 
Conclusions and Future Work 
 
This work has investigated the effects of various parameters of AMC structures comprising split-ring 
resonator (SRR) metallizations on the high-impedance bandwidth and resonant frequencies. Through these 
studies, insights into the roles played by these parameters may be gained, which could then facilitate proper 
designs of AMC structures and judicious selections of appropriate SRR geometries to be put into 
advantageous use in numerous antenna applications. Upcoming tasks could be, in addition to the performing 
the same investigations herein on other metallic shapes, to also use these findings as the characterization 
groundwork for the analysis and design of cavity-resonant antennas with enhanced gain involving partially-
reflective surfaces and reflectarrays.

b. Numerical Results and Discussions 
 
All numerical results presented herein for the patch array covered HRW array were generated by the 
moment method code developed according to the analysis and formulation just described. The computed 
data for HRW arrays without any form of cover were also obtained by the code constructed in Error! 
Reference source not found.. 
 
i.  Universal Conditions 
 
The fixed conditions that apply throughout the numerical investigations are first declared. A constant 
frequency of 10 GHz is considered and a square unit cell is studied, for which the periods, dx and dy along x 
and y, respectively, are both equal to half wavelength, i.e. 15 mm. The dimensions along x and y of the 
likewise square elemental waveguide aperture are lx = 0.98dx = ly = 0.98dy. 
 
A 10 GHz frequency is also maintained, being the TEM frequency of the hard rectangular waveguide 
(HRW) elements. Hence, the waveguides are operated at the hard condition Error! Reference source not 
found.. The ratio of the side-slab thickness (any one of the two slabs) to the total waveguide width is 
maintained at 1:40 throughout. In this way, the linearly-polarized aperture fields over the dominant central 
air region are uniform in amplitude, thus providing ‘clean’ elemental samplers of the focal plane fields.

superior to those of the uncovered FPA, for all beam angles. This constitutes an important finding: that 
when a patch array improves the performance of a certain beam angle, it also does so for all other beam 
angles. This elevates the advantages and desirability of such FPA covers. Explicitly stated in descending 
order of the total efficiency value, enhanced performance is achieved by the rectangular patch array when i) 
VCR = 0.25, HCR = 0.25, ii) VCR = 0.25, HCR = 0.4, iii) VCR = 0.25, HCR = 0.55, iv) VCR = 0.25, HCR 
= 0.7, v) VCR = 0.25, HCR = 0.85, vi) VCR = 0.4, HCR = 0.25, and vii) VCR = 0.4, HCR = 0.4. For the 
entire range of beam angles investigated, the top performing rectangular patch provides a slightly more than 
0.3 dB improvement. Therefore, we have demonstrated the ability of patch array covers to improve the 
overall efficiency of FPA-fed reflectors, not only for one beam, but over a range of beam angles. The square 
patch with VCR= HCR = 0.25 achieves the highest total efficiency amongst all VCR-HCR combination-
pairs and metallization shapes, according to Fig. 8. 
Observing Fig. 8 further, it is seen that although the optimum performer in terms of the traditional 
aperture efficiency is (VCR = 0.25, HCR = 0.85), it is instead the case of (VCR = 0.25, HCR = 0.25) that 
achieves the highest decoupling efficiency, with a lead over the other patch geometries so high that it offsets 
the advantage of the best aperture-efficiency performer to emerge as the overall ‘champion’ in terms of the 
total efficiency, which is what matters ultimately. As such, this present study exemplifies the importance of 
considering all subefficiencies. In other words, it is often not enough to just optimize one or a few 
subefficiencies, but instead, all subefficiencies contributing to the overall performance of the FPA-fed 
reflector system should be taken into account, as has been done here. Furthermore, at least for the present 
cases considered, it is demonstrated how significant the impact of the decoupling efficiency can be, so much 
so that it even becomes the primary factor that decides which design provides the optimal overall 
performance, even overruling the conventionally-sole gauge provided by the aperture efficiency. 
The directive gain plots of the parabolic reflector fed by the best performer (VCR = HCR = 0.25) of the 
square-patch array cover for the four beam angles (0, 1o, 2o and 3o) are presented in Fig. 9. These secondary 
field patterns are generated by Fourier integration of the aperture fields obtained via geometrical optics 
(GO) projection of the primary FPA feed-radiated fields. It is noted that the Fourier integrations are 
performed over the usual untilted focal plane aperture (perpendicular to the reflector axis), even for off-axis 
beams. These patterns are computed in the azimuthal plane containing the steered beams. As clearly seen 
from these radiation patterns, the various main lobes are reproduced very accurately towards the respective 
beam angles. The main beam levels are all close to the 54.4 dBi theoretical maximum directivity (for the 
present 167λ-meter paraboloidal diameter), in view of the high total aperture efficiencies, all about –0.8 dB 
(see the best performers in Fig. 8). This marks the excellent ability of FPA-fed satellite reflectors in 
achieving very efficient beams with high gain even for severely off-axis scan angles that are up to almost 
ten –3dB beamwidths, as is the case here. Satellite links can thus be established for regions and targets that 
are geographically far apart, thus offering a highly essential feature for satellite and aerospace applications. 
Aircrafts traveling at high speeds and often separated by thousands of miles may then be hooked up by the 
same single satellite, which also is able to track the fast-moving targets with its rapid digital beam-forming 
capabilities provided by the FPA feed. The corresponding contour patterns of the co and cross polar gains 
for the optimum square-patch array cover are given in Fig. 10, also for various beam angles. The gain levels 
here for both the co and cross polar patterns are with respect to the isotropic radiated power. As seen, for all 
beam angles, there is a deep null in the cross-polar level along the steered beam direction, and the maximum 
cross-polar levels occurring along the usual four azimuthal diagonals surrounding the main lobe are over 20 
dB below the co-polar main beam level.

c. Conclusions and Future Work 
 
The growing prospects which focal plane array (FPA) feeds have on enhancing the performance of modern 
reflectors play an important role in the progress of satellite communications and aerospace technology. Due 
to the obvious benefits of retaining a single but yet fast-steering and adaptive reflector antenna, such robust 
feeds offer strong advantages in terms of scan range, continuity of enlarged field-of-coverage, ability to 
provide services to widely-separated locations on earth, and flexibility in achieving rapidly-varying 
contoured footprints. For these reasons, a dedicated investigation into ways of further improving the 
capabilities of FPA feeds is justified. This groundwork has thus looked into and successfully demonstrated 
the ability of patch-array covers placed over FPA feeds comprising waveguide elements for achieving 
improved total efficiencies of singly-steered as well as multiple-overlapping beams, as compared to those of 
uncovered FPA feeds. It is shown that the decoupling efficiency of the FPA feed is an important factor for a 
complete and accurate characterization of the entire FPA-fed reflector system. Furthermore, we have aptly 
emphasized the importance of considering not only any one or a few subefficiencies but the entire set 
constituting the total efficiency. 
 
Future work includes the same studies as those conducted herein, but now for off-axis and overlapping 
beams. And in the context of the present project proposal, the other upcoming task would be to make use of 
these preliminary findings as the reference results for the same investigations into metallic array-etched 
dielectric covers, this time entailing split-ring resonator (SRR) elements. 
 
The results of this work have been gathered as a draft journal article which is pending submission.

The schematic of this antenna is shown in Fig. 11. The upper and lower diagrams illustrate the top and side 
views, respectively. The radiating face is composed of two concentric split rings with opposite gaps and 
which are short-circuited to the metal ground plane at one of each ends. On the left side of the drawings, 
there is a microstrip line that feeds the antenna. Other ways of excitation are also possible.  
 
Figure 12 shows the S11 (simulated and measured) for such an antenna whose arbitrary dimensions are as 
follow (with reference to Fig. 11 for the notations): R = 6mm, r = 4mm, c = 1mm, d = 1mm and p = 
0.25mm; for a substrate of PVC (εr = 3) with 3mm thickness. As the Figure shows for both simulation and 
measurement, there are two bands of operation related to the resonances established by the SRR’s, although 
the bands are not well matched in this example. The operation frequencies obtained by simulations fit 
properly with the measurements. The electric field distributions for both modes are shown in Fig. 13. 
Assuming the antenna is in the xy plane, the main field component is Ez as it would typically be for patch 
antennas. The inner ring mainly contributes to the excitation of the higher frequency resonance whereas the 
outer one to that of the lower frequency. In addition the separation between the inner and outer rings affects 
both frequencies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b. Circuit Model 
 
An equivalent circuital model of the antenna is now presented. The proposed model is as shown in Fig. 14 
and it is intended to qualitatively show the operation of the antenna. Firstly, LL and CL correspond to the 
typical equivalent circuit of a transmission line. These two elements are shunt connected to the antenna 
which is composed of two series capacitances (Cs1 and Cs2) defined by the coupling between the two SRRs 
(which depends on the distance between them) and also the gaps of both rings, two shunt inductances (Lp1 
and Lp2) generated by the SRRs and their connections to the ground plane, and two low order capacitances 
(Cp1 and Cp2), characterized by the total surface area of the SRRs and the substrate attributes (permittivity 
and thickness).

and p = 0.25mm; for a substrate of PVC (εr = 3) with 3mm thickness.

3mm of thickness. 
. 
 
c.  Parametric Study 
 
A parametric study of the effects which the different parameters have on the two resonance frequencies is 
now presented. The results are obtained by simulations and verified by measurements. An initial antenna 
will be considered whose dimensions are: R = 6mm, r = 4mm, c = 1mm, d = 1mm and p = 0.25mm; for a 
substrate with 3mm thickness and εr = 3. From this design, some parameters will be varied and their 
influences studied. Obviously, depending on the total size of the SRRs, the operation frequencies will be 
modified as in any resonant structure. A study of this size effect was carried out obtaining the results shown 
in Fig. 16, whereby the two operation frequencies are represented as a function of the relative size of the 
antennas, which is defined by a scaling factor with respect to the size of the rings in the preliminary 
configuration. Thereby, when this parameter is equal to unity, we are referring to the initial case. As this 
Figure shows, when the relative size of the rings is increased the operation frequencies exponentially 
decrease, as expected. 
 
Two other important parameters of the antenna are the thickness of the substrate and its permittivity. The 
influence of these two parameters on the resonance frequencies is plotted in Figs. 17(a) and 17(b), 
respectively. As seen, the upper and lower resonance frequencies fall considerably with increasing values of 
both parameters. This concurs with well known characteristics of traditional patches, whose operation 
frequencies are such that some dimension of the printed part of the antenna is approximately a multiple of 
 30
d. Prototype 
 
To conclude, a particular example of fabricated prototype will be studied in terms of return losses, gain and 
radiation efficiency. To this aim an improved feeding based on a multilayer structure is employed for 
obtaining better matching and more compactness. The microstrip feed line is introduced in a middle slab 
below the radiant elements which are located in the top layer. The scheme of this new antenna is illustrated 
in Fig. 18. 
 
 
Fig. 18: Scheme of a multilayer configuration of the antenna, with the feeding located in a middle substrate. 
 
The selected dimensions for this example are as follow: R = 6.5mm, r = 5mm, c = 2.2mm and d = 1mm; for 
two substrates of polypropylene, i.e. PP (εr = 2.2) with 3mm thickness of the lower one and 3mm thickness 
of the upper one. The ground plane size is 22mm x 17mm. A photo of the manufactured prototype is shown 
in Fig. 19. The simulated and measured return losses are shown in Fig. 20. As seen, the antenna has two 
radiation bands arising from the two rings as explained in the previous section. The simulations approximate 
properly the operation frequency of the modes.

e. Conclusions 
 
In this work, a strongly-miniaturized microstrip patch antenna based on shortcircuited SRRs has been 
presented and studied. In virtue of its two concentric rings, this antenna is able to provide two simultaneous 
bands of operation. A parametric study of the operation frequency has been performed, showing how it is 
influenced by the dimensions of the rings. Results have shown that the total size of the rings and the 
permittivity of the dielectric substrate have a significant effect on these resonances. In addition, other 
parameters such as the widths or gaps of the rings are relevant but in lower order of magnitude. The 
thickness of the substrate is a very important parameter, since it can strongly modify strongly the operation 
frequency. The grounded pins are key parameters of this design, as they are responsible for the antenna 
compactness. 
 
In order to demonstrate the operation of the antenna, simulations were carried out and prototypes were 
manufactured and measured to validate them. A final prototype was manufactured to show in detail the 
characteristics of the antennas such as gain, bandwidth and radiation efficiency, the latter being measured in 
a reverberation chamber. The results are very promising and some designs using this unit cell as the main 
radiator could be useful in realistic scenarios where compactness is required, such as for instance in RFID 
applications or integrated body communications where the employed antennas, according to the literature, 
have similar or even lower radiation efficiencies for the same antenna sizes. Moreover, by adding rings, 
further multiplicity of bands can be achieved. The concept of a multifunctional but yet light and compact 
antenna has thus been mooted. Needless to say, such antennas find vast applications in the mobile wireless 
age of today. 
 
The operation frequencies of the antenna bands are quite independent of each other. However, in principle, 
there are two limitations: the minimum difference between both operation frequencies is limited by the 
minimum distance between rings; and the maximum difference is limited by the maximum distance between 
rings that allows the coupling between them. However, even then, other parameters such as the gap of the 
rings (that can be loaded with lumped capacitors) or the ring widths, can provide more flexibility depending 
on the requirements of the application.

was for the preceding ANTEM conference, this APS symposium had allowed Dr. Ng 
Mou Kehn to meet up with old colleagues and friends in his international research 
network, thereby re-fostering the ties which he has with them. This is deemed to be an 
important aspect to him. 
 
All in all, both conferences had been regarded as highly successful to Dr. Ng Mou Kehn, 
scientifically and socially. It is believed that the attendances of such international 
conferences are important to the professional growth of a researcher, through scientific 
networking, keeping oneself relevant and updated with the current state of the art and its 
activities, as well as the demonstration of continued presence to the research society. 
 
In closure, Dr. Ng Mou Kehn is grateful to the NSC of Taiwan for its support of his 
attendance of these two conferences and he is glad that this Council recognizes the 
importance of conferences to any researcher as they are often the birthplaces of 
groundbreaking discoveries from which eminent journal papers ensue.

is an integer, and 0 0 0k ω μ ε= is the wavenumber of the central region. The upper and 
lower notations (scripts, symbol, etc) pertain to each other. 
 
III.  Numerical Results and Discussions 
The investigated geometry is first described. A universal set of waveguide dimensions 
is as follows, with reference to Fig. 1: total width (along x) w = 2(a + d) = 20mm and 
height (along y) h = 5mm. The investigated parameters are the host relative permittivity 
0rd dε ε ε=  and the ratio of the host-slab thickness to the total waveguide width: d/w. 
Proceeding to the results proper, validation of the present asymptotic approach with 
full-wave simulations (CST Microwave Studio) is first demonstrated. For d/w = 0.066 
and 0.13 respectively, Fig. 2 compares the dispersion diagrams generated by solving for 
the roots of the characteristic equations described by (1a) and (1b) with those yielded 
from the simulator, with various εrd cases in each figure. As seen, there is good agreement 
between the two tools in terms of the general shapes of the modal traces and their overall 
trends of variation with changes in εrd. 
Now that the asymptotic method has been verified, Fig. 3 presents the dispersion 
diagrams of the pin-lattice loaded waveguide obtained by using only this method. 
Visibly, a multiplicity of passbands and stopbands is found to exist in such a waveguide. 
Several general patterns or trends that constitute key characteristics of the waveguide can 
be deduced from these graphs. Firstly, there is a universal left-shift down in frequency of 
any general modal trace with increase in the host permittivity or the thickness of the pins 
layer relative to the width – both independently. This attribute is just very general though, 
lacking the specifics of the behavior portrayed by each mode type. Before proceeding to 
the details of the general trend of the modal traces as the host permittivity increases, 
several attributes are first defined: (1) lean of the modal trace Æ strong/weak lean means 
mild/steep slope of the modal trace, (2) TEM frequency, being the frequency at which the 
modal trace intersects the light-line, (3) “mode-cluster” comprising bundle of modal 
traces that create a passband. With these laid, the key traits of the modal traces and their 
physical movements along the horizontal frequency axis as the host permittivity increases 
are listed below:

When the excitation pattern of the PAF is according to this field distribution on 
transmit via conjugate field matching, the resultant reflector beam will be emitted 
towards that direction of the incoming plane wave. 
 For axial beams, the domain of integration for calculation of the well-known 
aperture subefficiencies simply spans over the usual circular focal plane perpendicular 
to the axis. But for off-axis beams, the field integration domain is a tilted elliptical 
aperture, perpendicular to the oblique beam direction. Therefore, the usual focal plane 
fields over the untilted circular aperture applicable only to axial beams have to be 
projected using geometrical optics continuation of rays onto the new tilted elliptical 
focal plane. 
 The synthesis of the focal plane fields of overlapping beams may be done by 
simply superposing the separately synthesized focal plane fields of the various beam 
angles involved. As for the subefficiencies, while each configuration of simultaneous 
beams has a certain decoupling and spillover efficiency, there is one set of aperture 
subefficiencies (illumination, polarization and phase) for every constituent beam, since 
these require field integrations over a particular tilted focal-plane aperture for each 
beam. 
 
Numerical Results and Discussions 
 
The fixed conditions that apply throughout the numerical investigations are first 
declared. A constant frequency of 10 GHz is considered and a square unit cell is 
studied, for which the periods, dx and dy along x and y, respectively, are both equal to 
half wavelength, i.e. 15 mm. The dimensions along x and y of the likewise square 
elemental waveguide aperture are lx = 0.98dx = ly = 0.98dy. A 10 GHz frequency is also 
maintained, being the TEM frequency of the HRW elements. Hence, the waveguides 
are operated at the hard condition [3]. The ratio of the side-slab thickness (any one of 
the two slabs) to the total waveguide width is maintained at 1:40 throughout. A 
subarray population of 21x21 is used in the sampling of the focal plane fields 
corresponding to the various beam angles. In the present study, a paraboloidal 
reflector with half-subtended angle of 60deg and diameter of 5 meters is considered. 
The properties of the dielectric slab over which the patch array is etched are also 
maintained constant. The relative permittivity of the dielectric slab is εr = 2.25, and its 
thickness is d = 1.25mm. 
Only two parameters are studied here. They are a) the ratio of the vertical dimension 
ly of the patch along y to the period dy along y, i.e. ly/dy, and b) the converse lx/dx for 
the horizontal dimension. The former shall henceforth be conveniently referred to as 
the vertical-cell ratio, or VCR for short, whereas the latter is termed the horizontal-cell 
ratio, or HCR. Extracting the few best performing cases of VCR-HCR combination 
pairs from computed results, the comparisons of their various subefficiencies with 
those of their uncovered counterpart are given in Fig. 2. As can be clearly seen, there 
are a few VCR-HCR combination pairs which provide overall efficiencies that are 
superior to those of the uncovered PAF, for all beam angles. This constitutes an 
important finding: that when a patch array improves the performance of a certain 
beam angle, it also does so for all other beam angles. For the entire range of beam 
angles investigated, the top performing rectangular patch provides a slightly more than 
0.3 dB improvement. Therefore, we have demonstrated the ability of patch array 
covers to improve the overall efficiency of PAF-fed reflectors, not only for one beam, 
but over a range of beam angles.

Antenna Geometry
The initial geometry of the proposed antenna is shown in Figure 1 (top and side
views). The antenna has a multi-layer conﬁguration. It can be considered as a
microstrip patch antenna since the antenna has a ground plane. The shape of the
radiating element is composed of two coupled SRRs which are short-circuited to the
ground plane. The antenna has a dual frequency response as Figure 2 shows. This
ﬁgure illustrates the S11 for a particular example whose dimensions are: R = 6 mm,
r = 4.5 mm, c = 2.2 mm and d = 1 mm (see Figure 1); for a polypropylene substrate
(r = 2.2) with two slabs of 3mm thickness. In this example, there are two bands
of operation. The higher one will be mainly deﬁned by the inner split ring and the
coupling between rings. On the other hand, the lower one will be mainly deﬁned by
the outer split ring and, as in the previous case, by the coupling between rings. The
gaps of both rings will have a minor inﬂuence on the operation frequencies, since
their capacitances are small.

Modiﬁcation of the Operation Frequency Making Use of Lumped
Elements
As commented in the previous section, the operation frequency of both bands can
be slightly shifted by changing the gap of the SRRs. However, these variations are
very limited. One alternative consists of introducing lumped capacitors which can
produce large modiﬁcations in the capacitance and consequently in the operation
frequency of the bands. Furthermore, in this section we will explore how to take
advantage of the frequency variations based on lumped elements. Nevertheless, it
is important to point out that the higher the capacitance introduced the lower the
eﬃciency of the antenna.
increase of the radiation eﬃciency when both bands converge to the same operation
frequency at 0.77 pF.
Finally, Figure 5 shows a manufactured prototype whose measurements will be pre-
sented at the conference.

Conclusions
In the present communication, a microstrip patch antenna based on short-circuited
SRRs loaded with lumped capacitors has been studied. Originally, the basic version
of the antenna presented a dual-frequency response. By making use of these lumped
capacitors in the gap of the inner ring, it has been demonstrated how to enhance
the bandwidth or the radiation eﬃciency of the lower band of operation.
Measurements of prototypes, validating the results enunciated in this paper, will be
presented at the conference.
