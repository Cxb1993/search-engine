Abstract –This paper presented an inverter based 3rd order 
sigma-delta ADC. Cascode structure and auto-zeroing 
mechanism are proposed for the gain enhancement and offset 
cancellation. The ADC has been implemented in TSMC 2P6M 
0.18μm CMOS technology with a core area of 0.54mm2. The 
measurement results show that for the 1-V supply, 20-KHz 
bandwidth, and 2-MHz sampling rate, the power consumption 
is 42μW and the dynamic range of 66.02dB.  
I Introduction 
For an aging society of the next decade, health and 
environmental monitoring devices are forecasted to be the next 
killer applications. In order to be portable, batter-powered and long 
lasting, the power consumption is required to be less than 1mW. 
For this, analog-to-digital converters (ADC) require special 
consideration because it bridging the analog part of the sensing 
devices and the digital part of the processing unit. 
Over the last years, due to its versatile architecture, 
sigma-delta (ΣΔ) ADC has developed into a wide rage of 
performance aspects for varies applications. It is able to achieve a 
dynamic range (DR) of over 100dB for high-fidelity audio and 
instrumentation applications [1]. For wireless communications, 
over 10-bit resolution and 10-MHz sampling rate is also achievable 
with reasonable power consumption [2]. For sensors and portable 
applications, power in μW range can be achieved using simple 
system architecture [4~9]. 
For low-power ΣΔ ADC, the operational amplifier is the key 
component. It dominates the performance and requires more design 
efforts than other part of the circuits. In this paper, we propose a 
very simple amplifier structure, a cascode inverter. With which, the 
design effort can be minimized and power consumption can be 
reduced. Of course, such a simple structure is not without 
drawbacks. The offset voltage is a major one. For this, a simple 
auto-zeroing technique is proposed to nullify the offset.  
In the rest of the paper, the system architecture is outlined in 
Section II, the circuit structure is studied in Section III, the chip 
implementation and measurement results are presented in Section 
IV, and the conclusions are given in Section V. 
II. System Architecture 
For low power design, the system architecture and circuit 
structure must be as simple as possible to reduce overall circuit 
area and stray capacitance. Figure 1 shows a single-loop 
multi-feedback ΣΔ modulator. Here, 11 1/)( −− −= zzzI  is the 
integrator and ia  is its coefficient. As compared to the MASH 
(Multi-stAge noise SHaping) structure, it has a much simpler

circuit structure. It may suffer from the stability problem when the 
order is high. However, the stability can also be guaranteed by 
selecting the coefficient carefully, using the following procedure. 
The noise transfer function of the ΣΔ modulator is as follows [3].

From (4), we learn that we are able to improve the SNR by 
increasing the coefficient ia . However, it becomes unstable when 
ia  is too large. To be stable, ( ) 5.1max <ωω jTF eN . Therefore, to have high SNR yet guarantee the stability, the coefficients are

switches completely, a bootstrap circuit is used to raise the voltage 
level of the clock. Figure 6 shows the bootstrap circuit. It is able to 
raise the clock level to 1.8V.  
Overall Circuits  
The overall circuit is shown in Figure 7 . It is a 3rd order 
single-loop multi-feedback ΣΔ ADC. Figure 8 shows the simulation 
results its power spectrum density (PSD) for 2-MHz sampling rate, 
3.9-KHz sinusoidal waveform, and 0.35-V amplitude. Figure 9 
shows the SNR and SNDR (signal to noise and distortion ratio) 
under different input amplitudes. The simulation results shown that 
the peak SNR is 75.74dB, the peak SNDR is 69.01dB, and DR is 
76.61dB.  
IV Chip Implementation and Measurement 
The proposed inverter based 3rd ΣΔ ADC has been 
implemented using TSMC 0.18μm 2P6M CMOS process. Figure 
10 shows the die photo. The chip has been measured using an audio 
precision analyzer and a logic analyzer. The sampled data is 
transferred to a host computer and analyzed by the MATLab 
software. Figure 11 and 12 shows the PSD and SNR/SNDR under 
the same condition as that for Figure 8 and 9. The measured SNR is 
65.87dB, the SNDR is 61.96dB, and the DR is 66.02dB. The 
effective number of bits (ENoB) is 10 bits.  
Table 1 shows the chip summary and comparison. The 
difference is about 10dB. The major source of the difference is the 
noise in the printed circuit board environment. The noise floor in 
the simulation environment (Figure 8) is -100dB; while it is -90dB 
(Figure 101) in the measurement setup. Because of this, we believe 
that through more careful test board design, the performance can  
be improved significantly.  Table 2 shows measured results under 
different sampling frequency (SF). It shows that the chip have an 
ENoB of 8/7 bits under 4/8-MHz sampling rate.
