Abstract 
Natural killer (NK) cells are important effectors of the innate immune system, which exhibits 
cytolytic activity against infectious agents and tumor cells. NK cells are derived from CD34+ 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Human umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been recognized as a 
rich source of HSCs. We have previously reported an optimized serum-free medium for ex vivo 
expansion of CD34+ cells from UCB. In this study, the serum-free expanded CD34+ cells were 
tested to differentiate into NK cells and their induction kinetics. After 5-week induction, the 
induced NK cells were characterized by analysis of surface antigens, IFN-γ secretion and 
cytotoxicity against K562 cells. The results indicated that NK cells derived from the serum-free 
expanded CD34+ cells exhibited both characteristics and functions of NK cells. Furthermore, the 
serum-free expanded CD34+ cells showed a significantly higher NK cell differentiation potential 
than freshly isolated CD34+ cells, and NK cells induced from serum-free expanded CD34+ cells 
showed higher concentration of IFN-γ secretion and ability of cytotoxicity than those from 
freshly isolated CD34+ cells. Therefore, the ex vivo expanded CD34+ cells in optimized 
serum-free medium could differentiate into NK cells and provided a promising cell source for 
immunotherapeutic approaches.

Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. Subsequently, cord blood CD133+ cells 
were obtained by magnetic cell sorting CD133 microbeads using the Miltenyi VarioMACS 
device (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To ex vivo expand CD34+ 
cells, CD133+ cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates (BD Biosciences,) in a 
serum-free condition as previously established. After 7-day cultivation, the expanded CD34+ cells 
were purified and set as day 0 for NK cell induction. 
 
3.2. Growth factors and chemicals 
The following recombinant human growth factors were used: TPO, SCF, FL, IL-2, IL-3, 
IL-6, IL-7, IL-12, IL-18, IL-15, GM-CSF and G-CSF were purchased from PeproTech Inc. 
Bovine serum albumin (BSA), L-glutamine, insulin, transferrin (TF) and 2-mercaptoethanol 
(2-ME) were obtained from Sigma. 
 
3.3 Culture Medium 
Serum-free medium for ex vivo expansion of CD34+ cells was prepared with Iscove’s 
modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM, HyClone) containing a cocktail of cytokines (8.5 ng/ml 
TPO, 4.1 ng/ml IL-3, 15 ng/ml SCF, 6.7 ng/ml FL, 0.8 ng/ml IL-6, 3.2 ng/ml G-CSF and 1.3 
ng/ml GM-CSF) and serum substitutes (1.5 g/l BSA, 4.4 µg/ml insulin, 60 µg/ml transferrin and 
25.9 µM 2-ME) (6). NK cell induction medium consisted of IMDM including a cocktail of 
cytokines (12.5 ng/ml IL-2, 20 ng/ml IL-7, 40 ng/ml IL-15, 50 ng/ml SCF and 50 ng/ml FL), 2 
mM L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone). 
 
3.4. Generation of NK cells from CD34+ cells in vitro 
After one-week culture, the expanded CD34+ cells were purified with magnetic microbeads 
conjugated to a monoclonal mouse anti-human CD34 antibody. Purified CD34+ cells were 
suspended into NK cell induction medium at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates. 
The induction medium was changed at weekly intervals, and cell density was determined and 
re-adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml. Freshly isolated CD34+ cells from cord blood without serum-free 
expansion were induced into NK cells as the control group. 
 
3.5. Flow cytometric analysis of CD34+ cells and NK cells 
Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated CD3 monoclonal antibody and PE-conjugated 
CD56 mAb and subjected to two-color flow cytometry on a FACSCalibor analyzer. NK cells 
were characterized as CD56+CD3- cells and expanded CD34+ cells were characterized as 
CD34+CD45+ cells, and gated with low side scattering according to the CD34 enumeration 
protocols developed by the International Society of Hematotherapy and Graft Engineering. A 
replicate sample was stained with FITC-conjugated CD45 mAb and PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 
as the isotype control to ensure specificity. 
For intracellular perforin staining, 1 × 106 cells after 5-week incubation in NK cell induction 
medium were first stained with PE-conjugated CD56 mAb for 30 minutes at 4 ℃ followed by 
fixation and permeabilization with permeabilizing solution for 10 min at room temperature. The 
 5
were less than 3% (Fig. 1D, 1E). Although the population of CD56+CD3- cells continued to 
increase to 54.2% after 7-week induction (Fig. 1K), the NK cell density and total NK cell number 
decreased due to cell death (Fig. 2). 
 Both serum-free expanded and freshly UCB-derived CD34+ cells were cultured in NK cell 
induction medium for 7 weeks to compare their responsiveness towards NK induction medium. 
Total cell density derived from both types of CD34+ cells increased rapidly. The maximum cell 
density to 3.15 × 106 cells/ml was reached at week 2 for the serum-free expanded CD34+ cells 
and 3.94 × 106 cells/ml at week 3 for UCB-isolated CD34+ cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). However, 
the serum-free expanded CD34+ cells showed a significantly higher efficiency in NK cell 
differentiation than freshly isolated CD34+ cells (Fig. 2B-2D). The maximal NK cell density 
derived from the serum-free expanded CD34+ cells was 6.53 × 105 cells/ml at week 4 in contrast 
to 1.79 × 105 cells/ml at week 5 in freshly isolated CD34+ cells (Fig. 2C). Cumulated NK cell 
numbers were 1.60 × 107 and 1.02 × 107 cells for both types of CD34+ cells at week 6, 
respectively (Fig. 2D). Since both types of CD34+ cells were initially seeded as 50,000 cells/well 
in the NK cell induction medium, each CD34+ cell could generate average 320 ± 26 and 204 ± 50 
NK cells after 6 weeks cultivation for the serum-free expanded and freshly isolated CD34+ cells, 
respectively. 
 
4.2. Surface marker analysis of generated NK cells 
  The cytotoxicity of NK cells posed on their target cells are mediated through 
perforin/granzym B and/or FasL pathways. Two subsets of NK cells can be identified by CD16 
antigen namely the transmembrane and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked forms; the 
former is found on NK cells, macrophages, mast cells and plays a role in signal transduction, NK 
cell activation, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) while the latter is present 
on neutrophils. The CD16 antigen is a low-affinity receptor for aggregated IgG. Perforin, FasL 
and CD16 surface marker analysis were performed to identify and characterize the NK cells 
differentiated from serum-free expanded CD34+ cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the induced CD56+ 
cells derived from serum-free expanded CD34+ cells and freshly isolated CD34+ cells both 
expressed FasL (both were over 85% in the population of CD56+ cells) but not perforin and 
CD16. It indicated that NK cells generated in this study were CD56brightCD16- NK cells, and 
expressed only FasL but not perforin. 
 
4.3. IFN-γ secretion by NK cells 
 IFN-γ is one of the immunoregulatory cytokines produced by functional NK cells and is 
used for verifying the differentiation process. After 5-week induction, generated CD56+ cells 
were purified to test their ability to secrete IFN-γ. After 72-hour stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18, 
CD56+ cells derived from serum-free expanded CD34+ cells and freshly isolated CD34+ cells 
both secreted a significant amount of IFN-γ, verifying their NK cell identity. The results showed 
that CD56+ cells derived from serum-free expanded CD34+ cells had a significantly higher IFN-γ 
secretion than CD56+ cells derived from freshly isolated CD34+ cells (Fig. 4A, 2.77 ± 1.22 ng 
versus 0.30 ± 0.11 ng by 2 × 105 cells).  
 7
be higher than that in the freshly isolated CD34+ cells from UCB. To this end, it was reported that 
the serum-free expanded CD34+ cells showed a higher telomerase activity than original pooled 
CD34+ cells, which is a characteristic of HSCs (5, 8). 
 Two distinct subsets of human NK cells can be identified based on their expression of CD56 
and CD16 — CD56dimCD16+ and CD56brightCD16-. CD56dimCD16+ NK cells express CD16 
(FcγRIII) which binds to antibody coated target cells and exert higher NK killing activity via 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). CD56brightCD16- NK cells are less cytotoxic 
than that of CD56dimCD16+ NK cells, but produce a higher amount of immunoregulatory 
cytokines such as IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor β (TNF-β), IL-10, IL-13 and GM-CSF. In present 
study, most NK cells derived from the serum-free expanded CD34+ cells and freshly isolated 
CD34+ cells were CD56brightCD16- NK cells. Some reports showed that CD34+ cells could be 
induced into both subsets of NK cells, while others reported CD34+ cells could generate only 
CD56brightCD16- NK cells in the presence of high concentrations of cytokines. Cooper et al. 
suggested that CD56dimCD16+ NK cells appear to be more terminally differentiated than 
CD56brightCD16- NK cells. In addition, CD56brightCD16- NK cells may be the early NK cell 
progenitor cell subset to repopulate the peripheral blood following the allogeneic or autologous 
bone-marrow transplantation. Therefore, further studies are required to clarify if CD56brightCD16- 
NK cells derived from the expanded CD34+ cells are potent to differentiate into mature 
CD56dimCD16+ NK cells in vivo. 
 Recently, Wallin et al. demonstrated that NK cells could express FasL by IL-2 stimulation 
and showed a perforin-independent cytotoxicity for tumor cells (2). Sconocchia et al. reported 
that perforin mRNA expression of NK cells derived from CD34+ cells was only observed on day 
0-1 of culture by RT-PCR analysis, but disappeared by day 7. They also revealed that the 
generated NK cells were lack of perforin and granzyme A by flow cytometry analysis. It is 
consistent with the observation that CD56brightCD16- NK cells derived from our expanded CD34+ 
cells and freshly isolated CD34+ cells expressed only FasL but not perforin phenotype. The 
generated NK cells derived from serum-free expanded CD34+ cells and freshly isolated CD34+ 
cells could produce the inflammatory cytokine, IFN-γ significantly after stimulation with IL-12 
and IL-18, and exhibited their cytotoxicity to K562 in vitro. To further compare the function of 
generated NK cells, NK cells derived serum-free expanded CD34+ cells showed a significantly 
higher concentration of IFN-γ secretion and higher ability of cytotoxicity than freshly isolated 
CD34+ cells. 
 In conclusion, this study showed that after ex vivo expansion in the optimized serum-free 
medium, expanded CD34+ cells retained their hematopoietic multipotency to differentiate into 
functional NK cells. The generated NK cells were confirmed by their phenotypic characteristics 
and functional tests. The functional NK cells may provide a promising source for 
immunotherapy.
