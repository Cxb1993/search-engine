二、英文摘要 
Opportunistic relaying (OR) has been proposed as a promising technique to provide remarkable gains in 
cognitive and cooperative wireless mesh networks. Due to the demands of high spectrum efficiency, 
co-channel interference (CCI) is among the main causes of performance degradation in wireless mesh 
networks. In this report, we study the effect of CCI in the decode-and-forward OR scheme under independent 
but not necessarily identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. Particularly, we consider OR with a 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based selection criterion and the destination performing maximal ratio combining 
of the signals from the source and the best relay. This structure is particularly applicable to the scenarios 
where the perfect tracking of the instantaneous interfering channel state information is unavailable in 
cognitive and cooperative wireless mesh networks. We derive approximate but tight closed-form expressions 
for the outage probability (OP) of the SNR-based OR in the presence of CCI. Moreover, we investigate the 
asymptotic behavior of the OP and examine the diversity orders of the SNR-based OR under CCI. The 
asymptotic OP for OR with a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based selection criterion is also 
provided. We further analytically compare the SNR-based and the SINR-based OR schemes. Finally, to verify 
the analytical results Monte Carlo simulations are performed, in which the SNR-based OR is more susceptible 
to the interference at the relays than the interference at the destination. In addition, more benefits can be 
gained by using the SINR-based OR when the number of relays increases.

not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels. To the best of the authors’ 
knowledge, such analysis is not presently available in the literature. The main contributions of this paper are 
summarized as follows. First, we derive a tight approximation for the OP of the SNR-based OR with CCI in 
closed form. Then, for more insights, we study the asymptotic behavior of the OP in the high SNR region and 
deduce the diversity orders of the SNR-based OR in the presence of CCI. In addition, the asymptotic OP for 
the SINR-based OR scheme is provided, which complements the exact results in [18]. We further analytically 
compare the SINR-based and the SNR-based OR schemes, and provide a simple expression for efficiently 
examining the benefits of applying the SINR-based selection rule. Finally, we validate the theoretical results 
through simulations. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the system models as well as the 
SNR-based and the SINR-based selection criteria. In Section III, we analyze the OP of the SNR-based OR in 
the presence of CCI. The asymptotic OP for both of the SNR-based and the SINR-based OR schemes is 
investigated in Section IV. Computer simulations are shown in Section V to verify the theoretical analysis. 
Finally, Section VI summarizes the main results of this paper. 
 
II. SYSTEM MODELS 
Consider a two-hop cooperative network consisting of one source, S, one destination, D, and M relays, 
i , for 1 2i M∈{ , ,..., } , as described in Figure 1. All nodes are assumed to use a single antenna and operate in 
the half-duplex mode. In the DF OR scheme, the best relay is selected out of the M available relays (the 
selection criterion will be described later). In addition, the best relay detects the received signals from the 
source and then re-modulates the data signals and forwards them to the destination. We assume that all the 
relays and the destination are affected by co-channel interferers. 
Denote 1 2=R M{ , ,..., }  as the set of the relays and IB  as the set of interferers affecting node B. 
Throughout this paper, nodes A and B
 
belong to the sets R{ }S ∪  and { }D∪R , respectively. Let BN  be 
the number of interferers affecting node B, that is, =B BN I  where H  is the cardinality of a set H . We 
consider flat fading channels, and denote A,Bh  as the A-B channel coefficient and Bn,g  as the channel 
coefficient between node B and interferer Bn I∈ . The channel coefficients, A,Bh  and Bn,g , are modeled as 
independent zero-mean complex Gaussian random variables with variance A,Bλ  and unit variance, 
respectively. We can adjust the  
5 
 
where []* is the complex conjugate operator. 
Denote 
2= 0A,B A,BAP h Nγ  as the instantaneous received SNR of the A-B channel and 
2= 0B B Bn, n, n,v P g N  as the instantaneous received individual interference-to-noise ratio (IINR) from 
interferer Bn I∈  to node B. The received SINR at the ith relay, i R∈ , is given by

IV. ASYMPTOTIC OUTAGE PROBABILITY 
In this section, for more insights we further investigate the asymptotic behavior of the OP of the 
SNR-based OR with CCI in the high SNR regime. We also study the asymptotic OP for the SINR-based OR. 
Finally, we analytically compare the SNR-based and the SINR-based OR schemes. 
A. Asymptotic OP for the SNR-based OR 
 From (18) and (23) in Appendix A, we can observe that ,1Pr ξ ≤Si ,i th,η γ( )  dominates over 
,2Pr ξ ≤Si ,i th,η γ( )  in the high SNR regime since the latter is expected to achieve one more diversity order 
compared to the former. For the same reason, we notice that ,2Pr ,ξ ≤η γi i, th( )MRC  dominates over 
,1Pr ,ξ ≤η γi,i th( )MRC . Therefore, the OP of the SNR-based OR can be asymptotically approximated as

where we have used the binomial expansion theorem and the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means to 
obtain the last inequality. Note that (16) provides a simple but efficient approach to evaluating the asymptotic 
OP improvement for various average IINR values, that we can achieve by acquiring the additional interfering 
CSI and applying the SINR-based selection rule. In addition, the approximation in (16) is shown to be 
accurate in the high SNR regime in Section V, and therefore, the lower bound in (17), which is independent of 
the average IINRs, is valid from the practical perspective. From (17), it is noteworthy that the SINR-based OR

that the MRC applied at the destination can alleviate the OP degradation due to the interference at the 
destination. In other words, performing MRC provides limited performance improvement when the 
interference at the relays is significant. Note that this result is contrary to the one in [14] which studied the 
effect of CCI in multiple-relay DF transmissions.

Fig. 3.  OP of the SNR-based OR under imbalanced average received TINRs (M=3 and 0.5=SRd ). Two networks with the S-D 
link and without the S-D link, respectively, are studied. 
We plot the OP of the SNR-based OR as a function of SRd  for various average TINRs in Fig. 4 where 
three relays (i.e., M=3), 0 15=P N  dB, and =Bw w  for B∀  are assumed. From Fig. 4, in the network 
without the S-D link the optimal relay location is shown to be at 0.5=SRd  due to the symmetry of network. 
13 
 
reason is that the gap between Pr ≤S,b( )η γSNR th  and Pr ≤( ),bη γMRCSNR th  in (7) becomes larger at lower 
average TINR values, and therefore, the relays require higher received SINR such that Pr ≤S,b( )η γSNR th  and 
Pr ≤( ),bη γMRCSNR th  are comparable. 
In Fig. 5, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the SNR-based and the SINR-based OR schemes for 
various numbers of relays with 1=Bw  for B∀  and 0.5=SRd . The asymptotic OP results for the 
SNR-based and the SINR-based OR schemes are obtained by using (11) and (14), respectively. Fig. 5 shows 
that the asymptotic results in (11) and (14) precisely describe the high SNR behavior of both of the OR 
schemes. In addition, Fig. 5 reveals that the SNR-based OR has suboptimal performance (compared to the 
SINR-based OR) but achieves diversity orders of M given finite average TINRs. 
The asymptotic OP gains of the SINR-based OR over the SNR-based OR, defined as 
= γG P PSNR SINRout out |∞ →∞ , is illustrated in Fig. 6 with 0.5=SRd  and =Bw w , B∀ , as a function of average 
SNR per hop for various average TINRs. The legend (9)/[18] represents that we use the analytical results in (9) 
and [18] to calculate the OP ratios. We can observe from Fig. 6 that (16) provides a simple approach to 
efficiently evaluating the asymptotic improvement in the high SNR region. In addition, when the noise powers 
dominate over the interference powers as in the case of 0.1=w , the SINR-based OR provides an asymptotic 
gain of about 12 −M  over the SNR-based OR, as shown in (17) with 1=c . This gain results from the 
consideration of S D,γ  when performing the SINR-based selection policy in (5). Furthermore, in the low and 
medium SNR regions, (16) is actually an upper bound which can be utilized to efficiently predict the potential 
improvement of using the SINR-based selection rule. Fig. 6 also shows that more benefits are gained when 
more relays are used. Moreover, in the high SNR regime, the SINR-based OR with higher average TINR 
values provides more benefits. On the contrary, in the low SNR region, the SINR-based OR with lower 
average TINRs shows more performance improvement.
