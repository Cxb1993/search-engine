Introduction
Electrochromism refers to the reversible electromagnetic
absorbance/transmittance and color change resulting from
the oxidation or the reduction of thematerial in response to
an externally applied potential by electrochemical
means.[1] One of themain uses of electrochromic materials
is in smart windows for cars and buildings[2] and in
antiglare rear-view mirrors.[3] Potential applications in
information storage,[4] electrochromic displays,[5] and
adaptive camouflages[6] can also be envisioned. Among
the different types of electrochromic materials,[7] conju-
gated polymers[8] such as polyanilines, polypyrroles,
polyselenophenes, polythiophenes, and in particular,
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and its deriva-
tives[9] attract increasing interest because of several
advantages such as mechanical flexibility, ease in band-
gap/color tuning via structural control, and the potential
for low-cost processing for large-area devices. For efficient
operation of an electrochromic device, it is necessary
to take a number of properties into consideration:
electrochromic efficiency, optical contrast, response time,
stability, and durability.[8c] The difficulty in achieving
satisfactoryvalues forall theseparametersat thesametime
stimulates thedevelopmentofnewmethodsofpreparation
of electrochromic films, new materials and components
for the devices.[10]

New polyhydrazides and poly(amidehydrazide)s bearing redox-active carbazole and triphe-
nylamine units were prepared. The resulting poly(1,3,4-oxdiazole)s and poly(amide-1,3,4-
oxadiazole)s had high glass-transition temperatures (288–330 8C) and high thermal stability.
The dilute solutions of all the hydrazide and oxadiazole
polymers showed a weak–medium photoluminescence
with emission maxima around 474–506 nm. The polymer
films revealed two well-defined and reversible redox
couples upon electrochemical oxidation, together with
interesting electrochromic behaviors. They showed
enhanced redox-stability and electrochromic perform-
ance. CV of the oxadiazole polymers also showed
reduction processes due to the formation of radical
anions of the oxadiazole units.

hotwater, anddried togive aquantitativeyieldof polyhydrazide2-
IPH. The inherent viscosity of the polymer was 0.34 dL  g1,
measured in DMAc (containing 5 wt.-% LiCl) at a concentration of
0.5 g dL1 at 30 8C. The IR spectrum of polyhydrazide 2-IPH (film)
exhibited characteristic hydrazide absorption bands at 3 392 (N–H
stretching) and 1 623 cm1 (carbonyl stretching). The other
polyhydrazides and poly(amidehydrazide)s were prepared by an
analogous procedure.
Film Preparation and Cyclodehydration of the
Hydrazide Polymers
A solution of polymer was made by dissolving about 0.6 g of the
polyhydrazide or poly(amidehydrazide) sample in 8mL of DMAc,
and the homogeneous solution was poured into a 7 cm glass Petri
dish,whichwas placed in a 90 8Coven overnight to removemost of
the solvent. Thepolymerfilmwas released fromtheglass substrate
and further dried at 150 8C in vacuum for 6h. The obtained films
with the thickness of 60–70 mm were used for X-ray diffraction
measurements, solubility tests, and thermal analyses. The
cyclodehydration of the hydrazide polymers to the corresponding
1,3,4-oxadiazole polymers were carried out by successive heating
the above fabricated polymer films at 250 8C for 30min, 300 8C for
1 h, and then 350 8C for 3h under vacuum.
Measurements
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 Fourier-
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. Elemental analyses were
run in a Heraeus VarioEL III CHNS elemental analyzer. 1H NMR
spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance 500 FT-NMR system
(500MHz) with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The
inherent viscosities were determined with a Cannon-Fenske
viscometer at 30 8C. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) mea-
surements were performed at room temperature (ca. 25 8C) on a
Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer with a graphite mono-
chromator (operating at 40 kV and 30mA), using nickel-filtered
Cu Ka radiation (l¼1.5418 A˚). The scanning rate was 28 min1
over a range of 2u¼10–408. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)was
performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were
carried out on approximately 4–6mg of samples heated in flowing
nitrogen or air (flow rate¼ 40 cm3 min1) at a heating rate of
20 8C min1.DSCanalyseswereperformedonaPerkin-ElmerPyris
1DSCat a scan rateof 20 8C min1 inflowingnitrogen.Ultraviolet-
visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the polymer films were recorded on an
Agilent 8453 UV-Visible spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL)
spectra were measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer. Solution fluorescence quantum yields (FF) of
the samples in NMP were determined by using the method of
Demas and Crosby[31] with quinine sulfate in 1 N H2SO4 as a
reference (FF¼ 54.6%). Electrochemistry was performed with a CH
Instruments 600C electrochemical analyzer. Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) was conducted with the use of a three-electrode cell in which
indium/tin oxide (ITO, polymer films area about 0.71.4 cm2)was
used as a working electrode. A platinum wire was used as an
auxiliary electrode. All potentials were reported with respect to
Ag/AgCl electrode at room temperature under a nitrogen atmos-
phere. Ferrocene was used as an external reference for calibration
(þ 0.44V vs. Ag/AgCl). Voltammograms are presented with the
positive potential pointing to the left and with increasing anodic
currents pointing downwards. An Agilent 8453 UV-Visible
photodiode array spectrophotometer was used to conduct the
spectroelectrochemical experiments. For the spectroelectrochem-
ical studies, the polymer film cast on an ITO-coated glass slide was
immersed in 0.1M Bu4NClO4/MeCN solution using a UV-cuvette as
asingle-compartmentcell equippedwithaPtcounterelectrodeand
a Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
Results and Discussion
Polymer Synthesis
A two-step procedure was employed to obtain the
poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s and poly(amide-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s
from the dicarboxylic acidmonomers 1 or 1’’with TPH, IPH
and ABH by using the phosphorylation technique that
described by Higashi and Ishikawa[30] (Scheme 1). The first
stage consists of the synthesis of hydrazide prepolymers
which are converted to the corresponding oxadiazole
polymers in the second stage by the thermal cyclodehydra-
tion of the hydrazide group into the 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring.
In the first stage, the polymerization proceeded homo-
geneously throughout the reaction and afforded viscous
polymer solutions. All the hydrazide prepolymers precipi-
tated in a fiber-like form when slowly pouring the
resulting polymer solutions into methanol. The obtained
hydrazide polymers had inherent viscosities in the range of
0.27–0.34 dL  g1 (as shown in Table S1, Supporting
Information) and could be solution-cast into free-standing
or flexible films, indicating the formation of moderate to
high molecular weight polymers. IR and 1H NMR spectro-
scopic techniqueswereused to identify thestructuresof the
synthesized hydrazide polymers. The 1H NMR and H-H
COSY spectra included in Figure S1 (Supporting Informa-
tion) confirm the correct structure of polymer 2-IPH. The
representative IR spectrum for 2-IPH (Figure S2) shows
the characteristic absorption bands of the hydrazide group
at around 1 623 (carbonyl stretching) and 3 392 cm1 (N–H
stretching).
Thermal conversion of the hydrazide group to the 1,3,4-
oxadiazole ring was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The
typical IR spectra for the representative polyhydrazide 2-
TPH and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole) 3-TPH are illustrated in
Figure S2. After curing at 350 8C for 3 h, the complete
conversion from 2-TPH to 3-TPH could be confirmed by the
disappearance of the absorption bands peculiar to the
hydrazide group at 3 392 and 1 623 cm1, and the
appearance of characteristic 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring vibration
at around1490, 1 600 (C¼Nstretching), and1012 cm1 (C–
O–C stretching). The experiment conditions for the
cyclization were selected on the basis of the weight loss
behavior observed by dynamic TGA and the cyclodehydra-

recorded in the range of 501–518 and 491–510 8C,
respectively. The amount of carbonized residue (char yield)
of these polymerswasmore than 62% at 800 8C in nitrogen.
The high char yields of these polymers could be ascribed to
their high aromatic content. The thermal analysis results
revealed that these oxadiazole polymers exhibited excel-
lent thermal stability,which in turn is beneficial to increase
the service time in device application and enhance the
morphological stability to the cast film.
Optical Properties
The optical properties of the polyhydrazides and poly(1,3,4-
oxadiazole)s were investigated by absorption and PL
spectroscopy. The relevant data are summarized in
Table 2. Figure 1 shows the absorption and PL spectra of
polyhydrazides and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s in NMP solu-
tions, together with their PL images on exposure to a
standard laboratory UV lamp. These polymers exhibited
strong UV-Vis absorption bands at 297–299 and 340–
389nm in NMP solutions, assignable to the p-p and n-p
transitions of the carbazole and other p-conjugated
moieties in the polymer backbone. In the solid state, the
polyhydrazides and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s showed
absorption characteristics similar to those observed in
solutions, with low-energy absorption lmax centered at
348–356nm with absorption onsets at 402–454nm corre-
sponding to optical bandgaps of 2.73–3.10 eV. Their PL
spectra in NMP solutions showedmaximum bands around
474–506nm in the blue or green region with fluorescence
quantumyield (FF) ranging from4.0%for3-TPH to25.4%for
2-ABH. The relatively lower FF values (4.0–8.7%) for the
polymers 2-TPH, 2-IPH, 3-TPH, and 3-IPHmaybe caused by
self-quenching due to intermolecular electronic interac-
tions between TPA/carbazole donors and benzoyl/oxadi-
azole acceptors. Although these polymers exhibited a low
FF, their solutions showed an obvious green PL when
irradiatedbya standard laboratoryUV lamp (see thephotos
shown in the insets of Figure 1). The highest FF (25.4%) of
poly(amidehydrazide) 2-ABH can be rationalized by the
decreasing charge transfer effect caused by the asymme-
trical structure of the ABH component. Furthermore, the 2
series polyhydrazides exhibited higher FF compared with
2’’ series. This could be attributed to the incorporation of
bulky tert-butyl group which may increase the mobility

(LUMO) of the polymers can also be determined from the
oxidation onset, reduction onset potentials (Eonset) or half-
wavepotentials (Eox11=2) andtheonsetabsorptionwavelength
(labsonset), and the results are listed in Table 3. By using the
oxidation and reduction onset potentials, the HOMO levels
for these poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)swere calculated and found
to be between 5.26 and 5.32 eV (relative to the vacuum
energy level), whereas the values for the LUMO levels lay
between 2.79 and 3.02 eV. The high-lying HOMO energy
level and reversible electrochemical oxidation of these
polymers suggest that they have potential for use as hole
injectionand transportmaterials inelectroluminescent (EL)
devices.
Spectroelectrochemical and Electrochromic Properties
Spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed on
films of polymers drop-coated onto ITO-coated glass slides
immersed in electrolyte solution. The electrode prepara-
tions and solution conditions are identical to those used in
the CV experiments. The typical electrochromic absorption
spectra of polyhydrazides 2-TPH and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)
3-IPH are illustrated in Figure 4. In the neutral state, these
two polymers exhibited strong absorption at wavelength
around 383nm, characteristic for triarylamine p-p transi-
tions, and their films exhibited a pale yellow color. Upon
oxidation (increasing applied voltage from 0 to 1.2V), the
absorption of p-p transition decreased while a new
absorption peak at 426nm and a broadband from
800nm extended to 1 100nm in the near infrared (NIR)
regiongrewup. Since thepotentials examinedare similar to
thefirst anodic process, the spectral changes are assigned to
the radical cation formation arising from the oxidation of
TPA unit. The absorption band in the NIR region may be
attributed to an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT)
between states in which the positive charge is centered
at different amino centers (TPA and carbazole). The IVCT
phenomenon of the family of triarylamines has been
reported in literature.[34] Meanwhile, the color of the film
changed from pale yellow to green. Upon further oxidation
at applied voltages to 1.4V, corresponding to the second-
stage oxidation, the dication (bipolaron) band at 785 and
776nm formed, respectively. Concurrently, the IVCT band
and the absorption peak at 426nm decreased in intensity
during this process and these films color turned deep green
or blue-green (as shown in Figure 4 inset).
Figure 5 shows the transmittance at 785nm for
polyhydrazide 2-TPH and 731nm for polyhydrazide 2’-

absorptive green state and exhibiting a high optical
contrast (D%T¼ 42%). The switching time was calculated
at90%of the full switchbecause it isdifficult toperceiveany
further color change with naked eye beyond this point. As
depicted in Figure 6, thin film of polyhydrazide 2-TPH
required 6.0 s at 1.25V for switching absorbance (a green
coloring state) at 1090nmand1.5 s for bleaching, reflecting
the different reaction rates between the neutral and
oxidized forms of the film. The electrochromic coloration
efficiency (CE; h) can be calculated from the optical density
according to[1]
h¼DOD=Q
where DOD is the optical absorbance change, and Q
(mC  cm2) is the injected/ejected charge during a redox
step. On the basis of this equation, the CE of polyhydrazide
2-TPH was estimated to be 137 cm2 C1, comparable to
those reported for several electrochromic p-conjugated
polymers.[35]
Conclusion
A series of new aromatic polyhydrazides and poly(amide-
hydrazide)s were prepared from a newly synthesized
dicarboxylic acid 1 with TPH, IPH, and ABH, respectively,
via Yamazaki-Higashi phosphorylation reaction. Sub-
sequent thermal cyclodehydration of these hydrazide
polymers gave the corresponding poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s
and poly(amide-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s. These polymers exhib-
ited blue or green fluorescence emission maximum
between 474 and 506nm in NMP solution with quantum
yield up to 25.4%. By substitution of the electrochemically
activeC-3andC-6 sites of the carbazoleunitwithbulky tert-
butyl groups, the new polymers exhibit better electro-
chemical stability and electrochromic performance than
previous analogs without tert-butyl substituents. Thus,
these novel polyhydrazides and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s
may find applications in OLED and electrochromic devices
due to their excellent thermal stability, stable electro-
chemical redox behavior, and enhanced electrochromic
performance.

New series of redox-active polyamides with di-tert-butyl-substituted 
N,N,N’,N’-tetraphenylphenylenediamine (TPPA) units were prepared via the phosphorylation 
polyamidation reactions from a new dicarboxylic acid monomer, namely 
N,N-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)-N',N'-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine, with various 
aromatic diamines. Most of these polyamides could be solution-cast into tough and flexible 
films with high thermal stability. They exhibited enhanced redox-stability and electrochromic 
performance as compared to the corresponding analogues without tert-butyl substituents on 
the TPPA unit. The polyamide with the TPPA unit in both the diacid and diamine components 
shows multicolored electrochromic behavior. A polyamide containing both the cathodic 
coloring anthraquinone group and the anodic coloring TPPA group has the ability to show red, 
green, and blue states, the additive colors for RGB based display devices.  
considerable interest as ideal hole-transporting materials in
various optoelectronic device applications such as organic
light-emitting diodes because of the strong electron-donating
and hole-transporting/injecting properties of triarylamine
units.18 Triarylamines can be easily oxidized to form stable
radical cations, and the oxidation process is always associ-
ated with a noticeable change of coloration. Thus, many tri-
arylamine-based electrochromic polymers have been
reported in literature.19 In recent years, Liou and coworkers
have developed a number of high-performance polymers
such as aromatic polyamides and polyimides carrying the tri-
arylamine unit as an electrochromic functional moiety.20 Our
strategy was to synthesize the triarylamine-containing mono-
mers such as diamines and dicarboxylic acids that were then
reacted with the corresponding comonomers through con-
ventional polycondensation techniques. The obtained poly-
mers possessed a well-defined structure, characteristically
high molecular weights, and high thermal stability. Because
of the incorporation of packing-disruptive, three-dimensional
triarylamine units along the polymer backbone, most of
these polymers exhibited good solubility in polar organic sol-
vents. They may form uniform, transparent amorphous thin
films by solution casting and spin-coating methods. This is
advantageous for their ready fabrication of large-area, thin-
film devices.
Recent studies have demonstrated that aromatic polyamides
containing N,N,N0,N0-tetraphenylphenylenediamine (TPPA)
segments show attractive electrochromic properties such as
high coloration efficiency, high optical contrast, fast response
time, long-term cycling stability, and multicolored electro-
chromism.21 The radical cations of these TPPA-bearing polya-
mides generally showed rather strong bands in the near
infrared (NIR) region because of a mixed-valence-type transi-
tion (charge transfer transition between pairs of chromo-
phores in different oxidation states22). Therefore, they can
be potentially useful as NIR electrochromic materials. In a
continuation of our interest in developing electrochromic
high-performance polymers having the TPPA moiety, herein
we synthesize a new di-tert-butyl-substituted TPPA-contain-
ing dicarboxylic acid, N,N-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)-N0,N0-bis(4-
tert-butylphenyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (2), and its derived
polyamides. With such a configuration, the electrochemically
active sites of the pendent phenyl groups of the TPPA seg-
ments are blocked, giving the polyamides extra redox stabil-
ity upon oxidation. As a result, the resultant polyamides are
expected to exhibit an enhanced electrochemical and electro-
chromic stability, which is of great importance in practical
applications. On the other hand, anthraquinone is an n-type
electron-accepting unit that can be chemically or electro-
chemically reduced to the radical anion and dianion
states.23,24 Anthraquinone derivatives and polymers have
been used as n-type semiconductors and electron acceptors
in fundamental studies of NIR electrochromics,24 molecular
wires or redox-controlled switches,25 and cathode materials
for rechargeable lithium batteries.26 Therefore, one of the
polyamides reported in this work was prepared from the
newly obtained diacid monomer (2) and 2,6-diaminoanthra-
quinone. This polyamide showed interesting ambipolar and
multicolored electrochromism because it contains two types
of electroactive groups, a p-type dopable TPPA unit and an
n-type dopable anthraquinone unit.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
According to the reported procedure,27 N,N-bis(4-carboxy-
phenyl)-N0,N0-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (20) (mp: 316–
318 C) was synthesized by the fluoro-displacement reaction
of p-fluorobenzonitrile with the sodium amide of 4-aminotri-
phenylamine formed in situ by treatment with sodium
hydride in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by the alka-
line hydrolysis of the intermediate dinitrile compound. As
described previously,21(e) 4-amino-40,400-di-tert-butyltriphe-
nylamine (mp ¼ 139–141 C) was prepared by the fluoro-
displacement reaction of p-fluoronitrobenzene with the so-
dium amide of bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amine formed in situ
by treatment with sodium hydride in DMSO, followed by hy-
drazine Pd/C-catalyzed reduction in refluxing ethanol. DMSO
and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were dried over calcium
hydride for 24 h, distilled under reduced pressure, and
stored over 4-Å molecular sieves in a sealed bottle. Commer-
cially available aromatic diamines such as p-phenylenedi-
amine (3a) (TCI), benzidine (3b) (Wako), 4,40-diaminodo-
phenyl ether (3c) (TCI), 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorene (3e)
(TCI), and 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (3f) (TCI) were used
as received. 2-Triflouromethyl-4,40-diaminodiphenyl ether
(3d) (mp: 112–113 C) was synthesized by the chloro-dis-
placement of 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzotrifluoride with 4-nitro-
phenol in the presence of potassium carbonate, followed by
the hydrazine Pd/C-catalytic reduction of the intermediate
dinitro compound.28 N,N-Bis(4-aminophenyl)-N0,N0-bis(4-tert-
butylphenyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (3g) (mp: 211–213 C)
was synthesized from readily available reagents according to
a reported synthetic procedure.21(e) Calcium chloride was
dried under vacuum at 200 C for 3 h before use. Tetrabuty-
lammonium perchlorate, TBAClO4, was dried in vacuo before
use. All other reagents were used as received from commer-
cial sources.
Monomer Synthesis

A mixture of 18.6 g (0.05 mol) of 4-amino-40,400-di-tert-butyl-
triphenylamine, 12.1 g (0.1 mol) of p-fluorobenzonitrile, and
15.1 g (0.1 mol) of cesium fluoride (CsF) in 50 mL of DMSO
was heated with stirring at 150 C for 18 h under nitrogen.
After cooling, the mixture was poured into 300 mL of metha-
nol, and the precipitate was collected by filtration and washed
thoroughly with hot water. Recrystallization from DMF/meth-
anol yielded 11.2 g of the desired dinitrile compound 1 as yel-
lowish needles in 40% yield; mp ¼ 251–253 C.

precipitate that was collected by filtration, washed thor-

(DMAc) into methanol were carried out twice for further pu-
rification. The inherent viscosity of the obtained polyamide
4b was 0.80 dL/g, measured at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL
in DMAc–5 wt % LiCl at 30 C.

Preparation of the Polyamide Films
A solution of polymer was made by dissolving about 0.6 g of
the polyamide sample in 8 mL of DMAc. The homogeneous
solution was poured into a 7-cm glass Petri dish, which was
placed in a 90 C oven overnight to remove most of the sol-
vent. The cast film was then released from the glass sub-
strate and was further dried in vacuo at 160 C for 8 h. The
obtained films were about 50–60 lm in thickness and were
used for X-ray diffraction measurements, solubility tests, and
thermal analyses.
Measurements
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720
FTIR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in a Her-
aeus VarioEL III CHNS elemental analyzer. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance 500 FT-NMR
system with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. X-ray
single-crystal diffraction experiment of diacid compound 2
was carried out on a Norius Kappa CCD four-circle diffrac-
tometer equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo-Ka radi-
ation. The structure was solved by direct methods using
SHELXL-97 software. The inherent viscosities were deter-
mined with a Cannon-Fenske viscometer at 30 C. Weight-av-
erage molecular weights (Mw) and number-average molecu-
lar weights (Mn) of the polyamides were obtained via gel
permeation chromatography on the basis of polystyrene cali-
bration using Waters 2410 as an apparatus and tetrahydro-
furan (THF) as the eluent. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) measurements were performed at room tempera-
ture (ca. 25 C) on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractome-
ter with a graphite monochromator (operating at 40 kV and
30 mA), using nickel-filtered Cu-Ka radiation (k ¼ 1.5418 Å).
The scanning rate was 2/min over a range of 2h ¼ 10–40.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a
Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were carried out on
4–6 mg of samples heated in flowing nitrogen or air (flow
rate ¼ 40 cm3/min) at a heating rate of 20 C/min. DSC
analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 DSC at a
scan rate of 20 C/min in flowing nitrogen. Ultraviolet–visi-
ble (UV–vis) spectra of the polymer films were recorded on
an Agilent 8453 UV–visible spectrometer. Electrochemistry
was performed with a CHI 750A electrochemical analyzer.
Voltammograms are presented with the positive potential
pointing to the left and with increasing anodic currents
pointing downward. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted
with the use of a three-electrode cell in which ITO (polymer
films area about 0.8 cm  1.25 cm) was used as a working
electrode. A platinum wire was used as an auxiliary elec-
trode. All cell potentials were taken with the use of a home-
made Ag/AgCl, KCl (sat.) reference electrode. Ferrocene was
used as an external reference for calibration (þ0.48 V vs.
Ag/AgCl). Spectroelectrochemistry analyses were carried out
with an electrolytic cell, which was composed of a 1 cm cuv-
ette, ITO as a working electrode, a platinum wire as an auxil-
iary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode.
Absorption spectra in the spectroelectrochemical experi-
ments were also measured with an Agilent 8453 UV–visible
spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were
measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectro-
photometer. Fluorescence quantum yields (UF) values of the
samples in NMP were measured by using quinine sulfate in
1 N H2SO4 as a reference standard (UF ¼ 54.6%).29
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Monomer Synthesis
The new aromatic dicarboxylic acid monomer 2 was success-
fully synthesized by the CsF-assisted N,N-diarylation of 4-
amino-40,400-di-tert-butyltriphenylamine with p-fluorobenzo-
nitrile, followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the intermediate
dicyano compound 1 (Scheme 1). IR and 1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopic techniques were used to identify the struc-
tures of the synthesized compounds 1 and 2. The transfor-
mation of cyano to carboxylic acid functionality could be
readily confirmed by the change of IR spectra. As shown in
the Supporting Information Figure S1, the cyano groups of
compound 1 gave a characteristic band at 2221 cm1. After
hydrolysis, the characteristic absorption of the cyano group
disappeared, and the carboxylic acid group showed a typical
carbonyl absorption band at 1693 cm1 (C¼O stretching) to-
gether with the appearance of broad bands in the range of
2700–3400 cm1 (OAH stretching). The 1H NMR and 13C
NMR spectra included in the Supporting Information Figures
S2 and S3 confirm the correct structure of the intermediate
compound 1. Figure 1 illustrates the 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectra of the target dicarboxylic acid monomer 2. Assign-
ments of each carbon and proton are assisted by the two-
dimensional NMR spectra shown in the Supporting Informa-
tion Figure S4, and these spectra agree well with the pro-
posed molecular structure of 2. The 13C NMR spectra also
confirm that the cyano groups were completely converted
into the carboxylic acid groups by the disappearance of the
resonance peak for the cyano carbon at 119.0 ppm and the
appearance of the carbonyl peak at 166.7 ppm. Other impor-
tant evidence of this change is the shifting of the carbon res-
onance signals of C14 adjacent to the cyano or carboxyl
group. The C14 of dinitrile compound 1 resonated at a higher
field (104.1 ppm) than the other aromatic carbons because

Properties of the Polyamides
Solubility and Film Morphology
The solubility behavior of polyamides was tested qualita-
tively, and the results are also summarized in Supporting In-
formation Table S1. Most of these polymers exhibited good
solubility in highly polar organic solvents because of the
introduction of the three-dimensional TPPA moiety and
bulky pendent tert-butyl substituents into the repeat unit.
Thus, the excellent solubility makes these polymers potential
candidates for practical applications by spin-coating or ink-
jet-printing processes to afford high-performance thin films
for optoelectronic devices. Among these polyamides, polyam-
ide 4d with the CF3 substituents showed the best solubility.
The result can be attributed to the bulkiness of pendent CF3
groups, which increased the disorder in the chains and hin-
dered dense chain packing, thus reducing the interchain
interactions. It is worth noting that polyamides 4a and 4c
formed an opaque film via solution casting from NMP and
showed less solubility. Except for 4f, the other polymers
could afford flexible and tough films. The WAXD patterns of
the polyamides shown in the Supporting Information Figure
S6 indicate that these polymers are essentially amorphous.
Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of the polyamides were investigated
by TGA and DSC techniques. A typical set of TGA and DSC
curves of the representative polyamide 4g are shown in Fig-
ure 4, and the thermal behavior data of all polyamides are
also summarized in the Supporting Information Table S1.
These polyamides show a high thermal stability; there is no
obvious weight loss before the scanning temperature reaches
to 450 C in nitrogen or in air. Their decomposition tempera-
tures (Td) at a 10% weight loss in nitrogen and air were
recorded at 453–540 and 439–560 C, respectively. The car-
bonized residue (char yield) of the polymers was more than
57% at 800 C in nitrogen atmosphere, ascribed to their
high aromatic content. The glass-transition temperatures (Tg)
of all the aromatic polyamides were observed in the range of
247–293 C by DSC. The relatively lower Tg and thermal sta-
bility of polyamide 4f may be attributable to its lower molec-
ular weights. All the polyamide samples exhibit no crystalli-
zation or melting transition in DSC measurements,
supporting the amorphous nature of these polyamides. The
thermal analysis results revealed that these polyamides
exhibited excellent thermal stability, which in turn is benefi-
cial to increase the service time in device application and
enhance the morphological stability to the spin-coated film.
Absorption and Photoluminescence
The optical properties of the polyamides were investigated
by UV–vis and PL spectroscopy. The relative data are sum-
marized in the Supporting Information Table S2. These poly-
mers exhibited strong absorption bands at kmax ¼ 351–361
nm in dilute NMP solution, which are mainly assignable to
the combinations of p–p* and n–p* transitions resulting

glass substrate as the working electrode in dry acetonitrile
(CH3CN) (for the anodic scan) or DMF (for the cathodic
scan) containing 0.1 M of TBAClO4 as an electrolyte and sat-
urated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode under nitrogen
atmosphere. The typical cyclic voltammograms for the repre-
sentative polyamide 4b are illustrated in Figure 5(a). There
are two reversible oxidation redox couples at half-wave
potentials (E1/2) of 0.69 V (Eonset ¼ 0.58 V) and 1.07 V for
polyamide 4b in the oxidative scan. The polyamide 4b films
were found to be very stable to p-type doping, with almost
no change in its CV diagram after 50 repeated cyclic scans
between 0.0 and 1.3 V. The two oxidation waves of 4b are
separated by about 360 mV, emphasizing the strong elec-
tronic coupling between the two redox amino centers of the
TPPA unit through the p-phenylene linker. The color of the
film changed from colorless to green and then blue as a
result of electrooxidation of the TPPA moiety. Figure 5(b,c)
displays the cyclic voltammograms and variations of the cur-
rent densities of polyamide 4b films upon an increase of the
scan rate up to 300 mV/s. A linear relationship existed
between the peak current and the scan rate, indicating that
the electroactive polymer film has good conductivity and
strong adherence to the ITO electrode.
The first cyclic voltammograms for polyamides 4d (with the
tert-butyl substituents on the TPPA unit) and 40d (without
the tert-butyl substituents) are illustrated in Figure 6. We
found that that polyamide 4d is more easily being oxidized
than its analogous polyamide 40d (Eonset 0.60 vs. 0.65 V).
Polyamide 4d also displays a more stable electrochemical
stability than 40d for a long-term scanning between 0 and
1.3 V, because the active sites of the TPPA unit in the former
are blocked with tert-butyl groups. Thus, the introduction of
bulky and electron-donating tert-butyl group not only greatly
prevents the coupling reaction but also slightly lowers the
oxidation potentials of the present polyamides. Polyamides
4e and 4f show a strong resemblance in the anodic CV dia-
grams as those of 4b and 4d. The oxidation potentials of
these four polyamides are compiled in Table 1.

segments of different electronic nature in the polymer back-
bone of 4g. The possible oxidation order of the redox centers
of polyamide 4g is proposed in Figure 9(c). The E1/2 value
indicated in each amino center was taken from the CV dia-
gram of 4g. Thus, the incorporation of TPPA units into both
of the diacid and diamine components causes the polyamide
to exhibit different oxidation levels, which make it to be a
multielectrochromic material. In addition, these electrochro-
mic TPPA-polyamides can also become highly absorptive in
the NIR region upon electrochemical oxidation.
Redox and Electrochromic Behavior of Polyamide 4f
Polyamide 4f exhibited an amphoteric redox behavior
because of the presence of both the electron-rich TPPA moi-
ety and the electron-deficient anthraquinone moiety in its
repeating unit. As shown in Figure 10(a), 4f had reversible
anodic peaks at E1/2 ¼ 0.76 and 1.12 V, respectively,
ascribed to the oxidation of the TPPA units. As expected, 4f
has somewhat higher oxidation potential than other counter-
parts like 4d because of the electron-deficient nature of the
anthraquinone unit. However, 4f revealed a very similar
spectroelectrochemical and electrochromic behavior as that
of 4d: a color change from pale yellow (neutral) to yellowish
green (radical cation) and then to blue (dication). On the
other hand, irreversible reduction waves for the formation of
radical anion and dianion of the anthraquinone units in 4f
[Fig.10(b)] were observed in the negative side of the voltam-
mograms at peak potentials Epc ¼ 1.51 and 1.89 V,
respectively. It is believed that a little unwanted

Electrochromic Switching and Stability
Electrochromic switching studies for the polyamides were
performed to monitor the percent transmittance changes
(D%T) as a function of time at their absorption maximum
(kmax) and to determine the response time by stepping
potential repeatedly between the neutral and oxidized states.
The active area of the polymer film on ITO glass is 1 cm2.
As a typical example, Figure 12 depicts the optical transmit-
tance and current density changes of polyamides 4d and 40d
as a function of time at their longer wavelength absorption
maximum (at 929 nm for 4d and 885 nm for 40d) by apply-
ing squarewave potential steps of 10 s (complete cycle time
is 20 s) between 0 and 0.95 V. The response time was calcu-
lated at 90% of the full-transmittance change because it is
difficult to perceive any further color change with naked eye
beyond this point. Both polymers attained 90% of a com-
plete coloring and bleaching switch in less than 4 and 2 s,
respectively, but polymer 4d revealed a slightly faster
response time than the corresponding 40d for films of near-
identical optical density. Electrochromic contrast attainable
with 4d (e.g., 58% when m ¼ 10 s) on repeated squarewave
potential stepping was found higher than that of 40d (e.g.,
49% when m ¼ 10 s). Coloration efficiency (CE; g) is a useful
term for measuring the power efficiency of the

ABSTRACT: A new carbazole-derived, triphenylamine (TPA)-
containing aromatic dicarboxylic acid monomer, 4,40-dicar-
boxy-400-(3,6-di-tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl)TPA, was synthesized,
and it led to a series of electroactive aromatic polyamides
with main-chain TPA and pendent 3,6-bis(tert-butyl)carbazole
units by reacting it with various aromatic diamines via the
phosphorylation polyamidation technique. The polyamides
were amorphous with good solubility in many organic sol-
vents and could be solution-cast into flexible and strong
films. They showed high glass-transition temperatures (282–
335 C) and high thermal stability (10% weight loss tempera-
tures >480 C). The electroactive polymer films had
well-defined and reversible redox couples with good cycle
stability in acetonitrile solutions. The polymer films also
exhibited fluorescent and multielectrochromic behaviors. The
anodically electrochromic polyamide films had moderate col-
oration efficiency (100 cm2/C) and high optical contrast ra-
tio of transmittance change (D%T) up to 47% at 813 nm
and 48% at 414 nm for the green coloring. After hundreds
of cyclic switches, the polymer films still retained good re-
dox and electrochromic activity. VC 2010 Wiley Periodicals,

INTRODUCTION Electrochromism is defined as a reversible
and visible change in the transmittance and/or reflectance of
a material as the result of electrochemical oxidation or
reduction.1 This is an intriguing phenomenon for which
there might be a wide range of applications, including optical
switching devices, color displays, smart windows, sensors,
memory elements, and camouflage materials.2 The property
of electrochromism is not unique to conducting polymers,
but is found in a variety of organic and inorganic materials.3
Significant effort has been put forth on electrochromic de-
vices based on inorganic electrochromic systems such as tung-
sten oxide (WO3) and nickel oxide (NiO or Ni2O3).
4 p-Conju-
gated organic polymers present improved processability and
better color tunability than their inorganic and molecular
counterparts.5 Electrochemical switching in conjugated poly-
mers, providing electrochromism, is a phenomenon possible
to achieve in robust device architectures operated at low
voltages. Considerable effort in the Reynolds group has
been focused on the understanding and the tailoring of
electrochromic properties in conjugated polymers such as
poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene)s6 and poly(3,4-alkylene-
dioxypyrrole)s.7 Many conjugated polymer systems exhibit-
ing attractive electrochromic performance have also been
explored by other research teams.8 The electroactive and
conjugated polymers generally demonstrated superior elec-
trochromic properties, such as a fast switching capability,
high contrast ratio, high coloration efficiency (CE), and good
long-term stability. Despite the attractive electrochromic per-
formance of many conjugated polymers, most of them were
prepared by electrochemical polymerization and in some
cases were insoluble after deposition on the electrode sur-
face, which may hamper their applications for large area
devices. In addition, long-term stability of conjugated poly-
mers remains a problem. For example, poly(3,4-ethylenedi-
oxythiophene) degrades over time if exposed to light or heat.
Therefore, there remains a great need to develop polymeric
electrochromics with useful electrochromic properties as well
as good processability and high thermal stability.
Wholly aromatic polyamides (aramids) are considered to be
high-performance polymers because of their outstanding ther-
mal and mechanical properties.9 A major problem with ara-
mids having high softening temperatures (particularly those
prepared with p-phenylene units) is their low solubility and
resultant difficulty in fabrication. One approach to solving this
has been the incorporation of bulky groups in the main chain
or as the pendent groups.10 There is continuously a huge effort
directed toward expanding the application of the aromatic

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Monomer Synthesis
The new dicarboxylic acid monomer, 4,40-dicarboxy-400-(3,6-
di-tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl)TPA (5), was synthesized by a five-
step reaction sequence as shown in Scheme 1. In the first
step, the intermediate compound, N-(4-nitrophenyl)carbazole
(1) was synthesized by nucleophilic aromatic fluoro-displace-
ment reaction of p-fluoronitrobenzene with carbazole in the
presence of CsF.15c Friedel–Crafts alkylation of Compound 1
with tert-butyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chlo-
ride gave 3,6-di-tert-butyl-9-(4-nitrophenyl)carbazole (2),
which was subsequently reduced by Pd/C and hydrazine to
3,6-di-tert-butyl-9-(4-aminophenyl)carbazole (3). The synthe-
sis procedure of Compound 3 is similar to that used by Zhu
and Moore22 and Chen et al.,23 but with a different reducing
condition. The synthesis of 3 also can be carried out by a
different reaction sequence as reported by Koyuncu et al.8(l)
The target dicarboxylic acid monomer 5 was successfully
synthesized by alkaline hydrolysis of the dinitrile compound
4 resulting from the CsF-assisted N,N-diarylation of com-
pound 3 with two equivalent amount of p-fluorobenzonitrile.
The structures of all the synthesized compounds were con-
firmed by IR and NMR analyses. The FTIR spectra of inter-
mediate compounds 1–4 and the target dicarboxylic acid
monomer 5 can be seen in the Supporting Information (see
Supporting Information Fig. S1). The nitro groups of Com-
pounds 1 and 2 gave two characteristic bands at around
1594 and 1326 cm1 (–NO2 asymmetric and symmetric
stretching). After Friedel–Crafts alkylation, the IR spectrum
of Compound 2 gave aliphatic C–H stretching absorption
around 2952 cm1 (t-butyl C–H stretch). After reduction, the
characteristic absorptions of the nitro group disappeared
and the amino group showed the typical N–H stretching
absorption pair in the region of 3300–3500 cm1 as shown
in the IR spectrum of Compound 3. The IR spectrum of Com-
pound 4 shows characteristic cyano peak at 2225 cm1. Af-
ter hydrolysis, the characteristic absorption of the cyano
group disappeared and the carboxylic acid group showed a
typical carbonyl absorption band at 1687 cm1 (C¼O
stretching) together with the appearance of broad band
around 2400–3400 cm1 (O–H stretching). The 1H NMR and
13C NMR spectra included in the Supporting Information
(Supporting Information Figs. S2–S5) confirm the structures
of precursor compounds 1–4. Figure 1 illustrates the 1H
NMR and 13C NMR spectra of dicarboxylic acid monomer 5.

S1. All the polyamides were highly soluble in polar solvents
such as NMP, DMAc, and DMF, and the good solubility could
be attributed in part to the introduction of propeller-shaped
TPA moiety and bulky pendent 3,6-di-tert-butyl-carbazole sub-
stituents in the repeat unit, which decreases interchain interac-
tions and increases the free volume. The polyamide 7c showed
a better solubility as compared with the CF3-free 7b analog.
The solubility difference between 7c and 7b can be attributed
to the effect of the large volume of CF3 groups, which dis-
rupted the regularity and dense chain packing leading to
decreased interchain interactions. Thus, the excellent solubility
makes these polymers potential candidates for practical appli-
cations by spin-coating or inkjet-printing processes to afford
high-performance thin films for optoelectronic devices.
Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of all the polyamides were investi-
gated by TGA, DSC, and TMA techniques, and the thermal
behavior data are summarized in Table 1. Typical TGA
curves of representative polyamide 7e in both air and nitro-
gen atmospheres are illustrated in inset of Figure 3. All the
polymers exhibited good thermal stability with insignificant
weight loss up to 450 C in both air and nitrogen atmos-
pheres. The decomposition temperatures (Td) at a 10%
weight loss of the polyamides in nitrogen and air were
recorded in the range of 486–546 and 482–541 C, respec-
tively. The mount of carbonized residue (char yield) of these
polymers in nitrogen atmosphere was more than 66% at
800 C. The high char yields of these polymers can be
ascribed to their high aromatic content. The Tgs of all the
polymers were measured to be in the range of 282–352 C
by DSC. All the polymers indicated no clear melting endo-
therms up to the decomposition temperatures on the DSC
thermograms. This result also supports the amorphous na-
ture of these polyamides. The softening temperatures (Ts;
may be referred as apparent Tg) of the polymer film samples
determined by the TMA method with a loaded penetration

Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical behavior of the polyamides was investi-
gated by CV conducted for the cast film on an ITO-coated glass
substrate as working electrode in dry acetonitrile (CH3CN) con-
taining 0.1 M of Bu4NClO4 as an electrolyte under nitrogen
atmosphere. The derived oxidation potentials are summarized
in Table 3. Figure 5(a) depicts the CV curves at different scan
rates for polyamide 7d, which was representative for the other
7a–7c analogs. There are two reversible oxidation redox couples
with half-wave potentials (E1/2) of 1.03 and 1.30 V (at scan rate
of 50 mV/s) for polyamide 7d. The first oxidation wave can be
due to the formation of triphenylamino radical cation, and the
second one is attributable to the oxidation of the carbazole
moiety. The two oxidation waves of 7d are separated by about
270 mV, emphasizing the strong electronic coupling between
the two redox amino centers of the TPA and carbazole units
through the p-phenylene linker. A linear dependence of the peak
currents as a function of scan rates confirmed both a nondiffu-
sional redox process and a well-adhered electroactive polymer
film [Fig. 5(b)]. Because of the stability of the films and good ad-
hesion between the polymer and ITO substrate, 7d exhibited
excellent redox stability. Polyamide 7d preserved good electro-
activity after 10 repetitive scans between 0.0 and 1.5 V at a scan
rate of 50 mV/s [Fig. 6(a)]. In contrast, the corresponding poly-
amide 70d without the tert-butyl groups on its carbazole unit
rapidly lost redox reversibility in five cycles [Fig. 6(b)]. Thus, the
incorporation of bulky tert-butyl groups on the active sites of
the carbazole unit lends considerable stability of the present
polyamides upon oxidation. According to these results, mecha-
nisms of oxidation reactions for polyamides 7d and 70d are pro-
posed in Scheme 3. For polyamide 7d, the two oxidation proc-
esses observed correspond to successive one electron removal
from the TPA and carbazole moieties. These processes are highly
reversible because of blockage of electrochemically active sites
of the carbazole moiety with bulky tert-butyl group. As reported
by Ambrose and coworkers in their pioneering work26 devoted
to anodic oxidation of carbazole and various N-substituted
derivatives, ring–ring coupling is the predominant decay path-
way. One possible coupling reaction of carbazylium radical cati-
ons to biscarbazylium dications shown in Scheme 3 can be used
to explain the irreversible oxidation process occurring in poly-
amide 70d.
The redox stability enhancement effect due to tert-butyl substi-
tution can be further confirmed by the CV curves of polyamide
7e as illustrated in Figure 6(c). Polyamide 7e exhibits three re-
dox-active amino centers in each repeat unit and shows three
corresponding quasireversible anodic redox couples. When
comparing the differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) of 7e
with that of 7a (see Fig. 7), we believe that the first oxidation
peak at Epa ¼ 0.83 V appears to involve one electron loss from
the TPA unit in the diamine component. This can be

with absorption spectra were then used to obtain the LUMO
energy levels (Table 3). According to the HOMO and LUMO
energy levels obtained, the polyamides in this study appear to
be promising as hole injection and transport materials.
Spectroelectrochemistry
Spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed on
films of polymers drop-coated onto ITO-coated glass slides
immersed in electrolyte solution. The electrode preparations
and solution conditions were identical to those used in the CV
experiments. The change in absorption of polyamide 7a film at
various applied potentials is shown in Figure 8(a), which was
representative for the other 7b–7d counterparts. In the neu-
tral form, at 0 V, polyamide 7a exhibited strong absorption at
wavelength around 350 nm, characteristic for p–p* transi-
tions, but it was almost transparent in the visible and near IR
(NIR) regions. The band gap of polymer 7a was calculated as
3.15 eV from the onset of the p–p* transition. Upon applying
potentials near the E1pa of 7a, the absorption of p–p* transition
decreased while a new absorption peak at 414 nm and a
broadband from 800 nm extended to 1100 nm in the NIR
region grew up. Since the potentials examined are similar to
the first anodic process, the spectral changes are assigned to
the radical cation (polaron) formation arising from the oxida-
tion of TPA unit. The absorption band in the NIR region may
be attributed to an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT)
between states in which the positive charge is centered at dif-
ferent amino centers (TPA and carbazole). The IVCT phenom-
enon of the family of triarylamines has been reported in litera-
ture.28 Upon further oxidation at applied voltages to 1.4 V or
above, the dication (bipolaron) band at 727 nm formed, which
was also monitored synchronously with CV [Fig. 8(a), inset].
Concurrently, the IVCT band and the absorption peak at 414
nm decreased in intensity during this process. The observed
electronic absorption changes in the film of 7a at various
potentials are fully reversible and are associated with strong
color changes; indeed, they even can be seen readily by the na-
ked eye. As shown in Figure 8(a), it can be seen that the film
of polyamide 7a switches from a transmissive neutral state

explained by the irreversible second oxidation process associ-
ated with polyamide 70a. Thus, the effect of tert-butyl substitu-
tion on the enhancement of electrochemical and electrochro-
mic reversibility and optical contrast ratio is very clear.
The spectral and color changes of the film of polyamide 7e upon
oxidation are illustrated in Figure S12(a), and the surface plot
diagram for the absorbance–wavelength–applied potential corre-
lations of this sample is depicted in Supporting Information
Figure S12(b). Before electrical potential was applied, the color-
less film of 7e showed an intense absorption at 350 nm. By set-
ting the potential to 1.0 V, the film showed a decrease in absorp-
tion at 350 nm with a concomitant appearance of a broad band
having its maximum absorption wavelength at 813 nm. This
spectral change corresponds to the first oxidation process of
polyamide 7e as shown in Supporting Information Scheme S2.
This clearly evidences that the first oxidation originated from the
TPA unit of the diamine residue in the 7e main chain. When the
electrode potential was adjusted to 1.3 V, the film gave new
absorption bands at 419, 534, and 736 nm and NIR absorption
from 850 to 1100 nm. We believe that the polymer has been oxi-
dized to one having the bis(radical cation) repeating unit as the
third structure shown in Supporting Information Scheme S2.
When the applied potential was set at 1.7 V, a strong absorption
band in the 600–850 nm region centering at around 728 nm was
observed, whereas the intensity of the absorption peak at
419 nm and the NIR absorption gradually decreased. This result
indicated the occurrence of the third oxidation. The film of poly-
amide 7e displayed a multielectrochromic behavior with colora-
tion change from colorless (L: 94; a: 2; b: 5) to green (L: 67; a:
30; b: 5), red–purple (L: 46; a: 9; b: 1), and dark blue (L: 17; a:
5; b: 11) along with increasing of the applied potential. Simi-
lar to that of polyamide 7e, the neutral-form polyamide 7f
showed intense absorption in the UV region peaked at 349 nm
(see Fig. 9). By setting the potential over 1.0 V, the film gave new
absorption bands in the visible and NIR regions, with coloration
changes from colorless (L: 95; a: 1; b: 2) to yellowish green (L:
64; a: 13; b: 19), green (L: 46; a: 22; b: 8), and blue (L: 22; a:
5; b: 30). As the polymer film of 7f was oxidized at 1.0–1.3 V,
the p–p* transition band at 349 nm began to diminish concur-
rently with intensifying of new absorption bands at 414 and
779 nm, and the film turned to a yellowish green or green color
at low doping levels. Upon further oxidation at 1.7 V, the absorp-
tion at 414 nm dropped, and a new strong absorption band
peaked at 730 nm arose; the film turned to blue. The spectral
changes had apparently arisen from the sequential oxidation
processes of the amino centers in the two different carbazol-9-yl-
substituted TPA segments in the main chain of this polyamide.
The possible anodic pathways of polyamide 7f are proposed in

POLYAMIDES CONTAINING (3,6-DI-tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl)TPA, Wang et al. 4789
Multicolor electrochromic poly(amide-imide)s with N,N-diphenyl-N0,
N0-di-4-tert-butylphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine moieties†

Received 25th February 2010, Accepted 6th April 2010
DOI: 10.1039/c0py00065e
A new imide ring-preformed dicarboxylic acid monomer bearing the N,N,N0,N0-tetraphenyl-1,4-
phenylenediamine (TPPA) unit, i.e., N,N-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N0,N0-bis(4-carboxyphthalimido)-1,4-
phenylenediamine (2), was synthesized from the condensation of N,N-bis(4-aminophenyl)-N0,N0-bis(4-
tert-butylphenyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine (1) and two equivalent amount of trimellitic anhydride
(TMA). A new series of aromatic poly(amide-imide)s (PAIs) 4a–4g containing the electroactive TPPA
moiety were prepared from the diimide-diacid 2 with various aromatic diamines by the
phosphorylation polyamidation reaction. All the polymers were readily soluble in many organic
solvents and could be solution-cast into tough and flexible polymer films. They displayed moderate to
high glass-transition temperatures (280–320 C) and good thermal stability. For the PAIs derived from
common aromatic diamines, cyclic voltammograms of their cast films on the indium–tin oxide (ITO)-
coated glass substrate exhibited two reversible oxidation redox couples around 0.68 and 1.10 V vs. Ag/
AgCl in acetonitrile solution, and they revealed high redox and electrochromic stability with a color
change from colorless neutral form to yellow and blue oxidized forms at applied potentials scanning
from 0.0 to 1.3 V. Cyclic voltammograms of PAIs 4f and 4g obtained from diimide-diacid 2 and
triphenylamine-based diamines exhibited three and four reversible oxidation redox couples,
respectively. Because there are more than two redox states are electrochemically accessible from PAIs 4f
and 4g, they could form tristable and even tetrastable color species and thus could display several colors
upon oxidation at varying applied voltages. The electrochromic performance of a representative PAI 4c
was investigated. This anodically coloring polymer film showed good electrochromic properties with
high coloration efficiency (CE ¼ 268 cm2 C1 for the yellow coloration) and high optical contrast ratio
of transmittance change (DT%) up to 33% at 411 nm and 32% at 922 nm for the yellow coloring, and
72% at 698 nm for the blue coloring. After over 100 cyclic switches, the polymer films still retained
excellent redox and electrochromic activity.
Introduction
Electrochromic materials exhibit a change in optical absorption
or transmittance upon redox switching. There are many chemical
systems that are intrinsically electrochromic, such as transition
metal oxides, inorganic coordination complexes, organic mole-
cules, and conjugated polymers.1 Traditionally, interest in elec-
trochromic materials has been directed towards optical changes
in the visible region, leading to many technological applications
such as variable reflectance mirrors, tunable windows, and elec-
trochromic displays.2 Of the available electrochromic materials,
conjugated conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-alkylenedioxy-
thiophene) and poly(3,4-alkylenedioxypyrrole) based polymers
and other similar systems have become widely researched elec-
trochromic materials because of their fast switching speeds,
improved processability, and color tunability through structural
modification.3–5 In recent years, we have carried out extensive
studies on the design and synthesis of triarylamine-based high-
performance polymers such as aromatic polyamides and poly-
imides for electrochromic applications.6 The electrochromic
function of these polymers came from the triarylamine core
which can be easily oxidized and the resulting radical cation is
stable enough and can undergo long-standing redox cycles.
Aromatic poly(amide-imide)s (PAIs) possess balanced char-
acteristics between polyamides and polyimides such as high
thermal stability and good mechanical properties together with
ease of processability.7 Since we successfully applied the Yama-
zaki-Higashi phosphorylation reaction8 to the direct synthesis of
high-molecular-weight PAIs from the TMA-derived imide ring-
bearing dicarboxylic acids and aromatic diamines using triphenyl
phosphite (TPP) and pyridine as condensing agents,9 this efficient
synthetic route has proved to exhibit significant advantages in
preparing operations as compared with conventional acid chlo-
ride or isocyanate methods.10 Thus, many novel PAIs have been
readily prepared by this convenient technique in our and other
laboratories.11 Furthermore, this synthetic procedure can offer
us the option of the incorporation of specific functionalities
between amide or imide groups in the PAI backbone. The
incorporation of such functional groups may provide a method
of controlling certain physical properties or special functions of
the resulting PAIs.

poured slowly with stirring into 150 mL of methanol, giving rise
to a tough, fibrous precipitate. The precipitated product was
collected by filtration, washed repeatedly with methanol and hot
water, and dried to give a quantitative yield of PAI 4a. The
inherent viscosity of the polymer was 0.61 dL/g, measured in
DMAc (containing 5 wt% LiCl) at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL at
30 C. The IR spectrum of 4a (film) exhibited characteristic
amide absorption bands at 3200–3400 cm1 (amide N–H str.) and
1675 cm1 (amide carbonyl str.), together with the imide
absorption bands at 1778 cm1 (asymmetrical C] O str.), 1724
cm1 (symmetrical C ] O str.), and 725 cm1 (imide ring
deformation).
Preparation of the PAI films
A solution of polymer was made by dissolving about 0.6 g of the
PAI sample in 10 mL of DMAc. The homogeneous solution was
poured into a 9 cm glass Petri dish, which was placed in a 90 C
oven overnight to remove most of the solvent. The cast film was
then released from the glass substrate and was further dried in
vacuo at 160 C for 8 h. The obtained films were about 50–60 mm
in thickness and were used for X-ray diffraction measurements,
solubility tests and thermal analyses.
Measurements
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 FT-IR
spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in a Heraeus VarioEL
III CHNS elemental analyzer. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were
measured on a Bruker AVANCE 500 FT-NMR system with
tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The inherent viscosi-
ties were determined with a Cannon-Fenske viscometer at 30 C.
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were
performed at room temperature (ca. 25 C) on a Shimadzu XRD-
6000 X-ray diffractometer with a graphite monochromator
(operating at 40 kV and 30 mA), using nickel-filtered Cu-Ka
radiation (l ¼ 1.5418 A). The scanning rate was 2 min1 over
a range of 2q ¼ 10–40. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was
performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were
carried out on approximately 4–6 mg of samples heated in
flowing nitrogen or air (flow rate ¼ 40 cm3 min1) at a heating
rate of 20 C min1. DSC analyses were performed on a Perkin-
Elmer Pyris 1 DSC at a scan rate of 20 C min1 in flowing
nitrogen. Thermomechanical analysis (TMA) was determined
with a Perkin-Elmer TMA 7 instrument. The TMA experiments
were carried out from 50 to 400 C at a scan rate of 10 C min1
with a penetration probe 1.0 mm in diameter under an applied
constant load of 10 mN. Softening temperatures (Ts) were taken
as the onset temperatures of probe displacement on the TMA
traces. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the polymer films
were recorded on an Agilent 8453 UV-Visible spectrometer.
Electrochemistry was performed with a CHI 611C electro-
chemical analyzer. Voltammograms are presented with the
positive potential pointing to the left and with increasing anodic
currents pointing downwards. Cyclic voltammetry was con-
ducted with the use of a three-electrode cell in which ITO
(polymer films area about 0.8 cm  1.25 cm) was used as
a working electrode. A platinum wire was used as an auxiliary
electrode. All cell potentials were taken with the use of a home-
made Ag/AgCl, KCl (sat.) reference electrode. Ferrocene was
used as an external reference for calibration (+0.48 V vs. Ag/
AgCl). Spectroelectrochemistry analyses were carried out with an
electrolytic cell, which was composed of a 1 cm cuvette, ITO as
a working electrode, a platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode,
and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Absorption spectra in the
spectroelectrochemical experiments were measured with an
Agilent 8453 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Coloration effi-
ciency is derived from the equation: h ¼ DOD/Q,17 DOD is
optical density change at specific absorption wavelength and Q is
ejected charge determined from the in situ experiments. Photo-
luminescence (PL) spectra were measured with a Varian Cary

Results and discussion
Monomer synthesis
The TPPA-containing diimide-dicarboxylic acid monomer,
N,N-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N0,N0-bis(4-carboxyphthalimido)-
1,4-phenylenediamine (2), was obtained by reacting diamine 1
with 2 mol equiv of trimellitic anhydride (TMA) in refluxing
glacial acetic acid (Scheme 1). IR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR
spectroscopic techniques were used to identify the structure of
the targeted diimide-dicarboxylic acid 2. The IR spectrum of 2
(Fig. S1, ESI†) showed absorption bands around 2700–3400
(–OH, carboxylic acid), 1778 (imide C]O asymmetrical
stretching), and 1724 cm1 (imide C]O symmetrical stretching

indicated no clear melting endotherms up to the decomposition
temperatures on the DSC thermograms. This result also supports
the amorphous nature of these PAIs. Comparing the thermal
properties data, one will find that PAI 4e showed the highest Tg
due to the attachment of bulky lateral fluorene groups thus
restricting the segmental mobility. The softening temperatures
(Ts) of the polymer film samples were determined by the TMA
method with a loaded penetration probe. They are obtained from
the onset temperature of the probe displacement on the TMA
trace. A representative TMA thermogram for PAI 4a is illus-
trated in Fig. 2. In all cases, the Ts values obtained by TMA are
lower (by 15–34 C) than the Tg values measured by the DSC
experiments (Table 2). This may indicate that these PAIs
exhibited a higher degree of plasticity near Tg because of the
increased free volume caused by the bulky TPPA and tert-butyl
groups.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of the PAIs are investigated by UV-vis
absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The
results are summarized in Table 3. These polymers exhibit strong
UV-vis absorption bands at 306–313 nm in NMP solution, which
can be attributed to the combinations of n-p* and p–p* tran-
sition originating from the conjugated TPPA moieties. In solid
state, these PAIs showed UV-vis absorption characteristics (lmax
around 306–317 nm) similar to those in the solution. These PAIs
exhibited fluorescence emission maxima around 370–385 nm in
NMP solution with extremely low fluorescence quantum yield
ranging from 0.23% for 4d to 0.47% for 4e. The low fluorescence
efficiency can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer
quenching effect between the TPPA donor and the imide
acceptor.
The electrochemical behavior of the PAIs was investigated by
cyclic voltammetry (CV) conducted for the cast film on an ITO-
coated glass substrate as working electrode in dry acetonitrile

(CH3CN) containing 0.1 M of Bu4NClO4 as an electrolyte under
nitrogen atmosphere. The derived oxidation potentials are
summarized in Table 3. Fig. 3 shows the CV curves for PAIs 4c
and 40c. There are two reversible oxidation redox couples with
half-wave potentials (E1/2) of 0.69 V and 1.04 V for PAI 4c and
one reversible oxidation redox couple with E1/2 of 1.00 V for PAI
40c in the oxidative scan. The two oxidation waves of 4c are
separated by about 350 mV, emphasizing the strong electronic
coupling between the amino groups in the TPPA moiety through
the p-phenylene linker. Because of the stability of the films and
good adhesion between the polymer and ITO substrate, the 4c
exhibited excellent redox stability. PAI 4c preserved excellent
elecroactivity after 50 cycles between 0.0 and 1.3 V. Upon
oxidation, the polymer film of 4c exhibited a multi-electro-
chromic behavior; a color change from colorless to yellow at 0.8
V and then to blue at 1.2 V. For PAI 4c, the two oxidations
observed correspond to successive one electron removal from the
TPPA functionality of 4c to yield, first, a stable, delocalized
TPPA radical cation and, second, a quinonediimine-type dica-
tion. The first oxidation at E1/2 ¼ 0.69 V for PAI 4c could be
assigned to electron loss from the nitrogen atom in the pendent
4,40-di-tert-butyldiphenylamine unit, which is more electron-rich
than the nitrogen atom on the main-chain amino group. The
highly stable redox stability of this polymer can be attributed to
the presence of tert-butyl group on the active sites of the TPPA
moiety. It is well known that triarylamines with substituents in
their para-position generally show reversible one-electron
oxidation behavior.19
The CV curve of PAI 4f is illustrated in Fig. 4, where those of
PAIs 4c and 40c are also included for comparison. PAI 4f exhibits
three redox amino centers in each repeat unit and shows three
corresponding quasireversible anodic redox couples. The second
oxidation at E1/2 ¼ 0.89 V appears to involve one electron loss
from the triphenylamine unit between the amide linkages. The
first (E1/2 ¼ 0.69 V) and third (E1/2 ¼ 1.05 V) oxidation waves are
related to the electron losses from the electroactive TPPA unit of
4f. These potentials are similar to those associated with mono-
cation and dication formations from the TPPA unit in PAI 4c.
Therefore, a possible anodic oxidation pathway of PAI 4f is
proposed as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI).† The electrochemical
stability of PAI 4f could also be ascribed to the fact that all the
electrochemically active sites of the arylamino unit are blocked
with tert-butyl groups.
Fig. 5 compares the cyclic voltammograms and differential
pulse voltammograms of PAI 4g and structurally related PAIs 4c
and 40 0c. PAIs 4c and 400c, which have isomeric repeating units
with the TPPA unit in different segments, each revealed two
well-resolved, reversible redox couples in their CV diagrams,
corresponding to two sequential electron removals from the
electroactive TPPA unit in their polymer backbones. The onset
potentials of the oxidative processes of PAI 40 0c are lower than
those of PAI 4c. This can be rationalized because the TPPA
segment is incorporated in the amide portion in the former case.
Therefore, the amino units became more easily oxidized. PAI 4g
also shows two apparent redox couples. However, the peak is

film (Fig. 6) during electrochemical oxidation. In the neutral
state, PAI 4c exhibited strong absorption at wavelength around
313 nm, characteristic for triarylamine p–p* transitions, but it
was almost transparent in the visible and near infrared (NIR)
regions. When the applied potential was gradually raised from
0.8 to 1.0 V, the absorption intensity at 313 nm slightly dropped
and a new shoulder band appeared at 411 nm accompanied with
a broad band having its maximum around 922 nm in the NIR
region. We attribute this spectral change to the formation of
a stable monocation radical from the TPPA moiety. The
absorption band in the NIR region is assigned to an intervalence
charge-transfer (IV-CT) between states in which the positive
charge is centered at different amino centers.13,21 The intensity of
the IV-CT band gradually decreased when the TPPA radical
cation was further oxidized to the dication (at electrode potential
of 1.3 V), with a formation of a new strong absorption band
centered at about 698 nm. The observed absorption changes of
the film of PAI 4c are fully reversible and are associated with
strong color changes. From the photos shown in Fig. 6, it can be
seen that the film switches from a transmissive neutral state
(nearly colorless) to a highly absorbing semioxidized state
(yellow) and a fully oxidized state (blue).
Next, PAIs 4f and 4g were examined. Their spectral changes
upon oxidation are illustrated in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively. In the
neutral state, these two PAIs revealed an absorption tail in the
region of 400–550 nm in addition to the strong p–p* transition
bands at 313 nm. Therefore, in the neutral state their films
exhibited a pale yellow color, not completely colorless. The
absorption tail may be accounted for a stronger interchain
charge-transfer interaction between the arylamino donor
(between the amide groups) and the trimellitimido acceptor.
Similar to that observed for PAI 4c, as the applied potential was
raised to 0.8 V PAI 4f showed a decrease in absorption at 313 nm
with a concomitant appearance of a peak at 411 nm and a broad
IV-CT band centered around 922 nm. This spectral change
corresponds to the first oxidation process of 4f as shown in
Scheme S1.† When the electrode potential was adjusted to 1.0 V,
another absorption band appeared at 792 nm and the strong IV-
CT band at the NIR region still could be observed. This clearly
provides evidence that the second oxidation originates from the
triphenylamine core between the amide groups in the 4f main
chain. We believe that the polymer has been oxidized to one with
the bis(radical cation) repeating unit as the third structure shown
in Scheme S1.† When the applied potential was set at 1.3 V,
a strong absorption band in the 450–900 nm region centering at
around 685 nm was observed, whereas the intensity of the
absorption peak at 411 nm and the IV-CT band gradually
decreased. The almost disappearance of the IV-CT absorption
indicates the full oxidation of all the three amino centers in the
repeat unit of 4f. As can be seen from the inset in Fig. 7, the film
of PAI 4f displayed multi-electrochromic behavior with colora-
tion change from pale yellow to yellowish green, green, and blue
along with increasing of the applied potential.
A similar spectral change was observed for PAI 4g at early
stage of oxidation (Fig. 8). The absorption peak at 416 nm and
the IV-CT band at 997 nm started to appear when the applied
potential was set at 0.8 V and reached the maximum when the
applied potential was raised to 1.0 V. This result illustrated that
the first two oxidations of the TPPA units occurred almost
simultaneously. Although the oxidation waves could not be well-
resolved in the CV analysis for the third and fourth oxidations,
the stepwise oxidation processes were clearly evidenced by the
spectroelectrochemistry experiments. Further increase of the
applied potential over 1.0 V led to the increase of the absorption
intensity between 600 and 850 nm. This absorption change
indicated the occurrence of the third oxidation. Upon further
oxidation, the absorption band at 416 nm reached the minimum
intensity and the band at 500–800 nm further intensified. It was
also found that the IV-CT band at the NIR region diminished
gradually, implying the occurrence of the fourth oxidation.
When the polymer film of 4g was oxidized, its color changed
from pale yellow to deeper yellow, yellowish green, greenish blue,

ABSTRACT: A new triphenylamine-based diamine monomer,
4,40-diamino-200,400-dimethoxytriphenylamine (2), was synthesized
from readily available reagents and was reacted with various aro-
matic dicarboxylic acids to produce a series of aromatic poly-
amides (4a–h) containing the redox-active 2,4-dimethoxy-
substituted triphenylamine (dimethoxyTPA) unit. All the resulting
polyamides were readily soluble in polar organic solvents and
could be solution cast into tough and flexible films. These poly-
mers exhibited good thermal stability with glass transition temper-
atures of 243–289 C and softening temperatures of 238–280 C,
10% weight loss temperatures in excess of 470 C in nitrogen, and
char yields higher than 60% at 800 C in nitrogen. The redox behav-
iors of the polymers were examined using cyclic voltammetry
(CV). All these polyamides showed two reversible oxidation pro-
cesses in the first CV scan. The polymers also displayed low ioniza-
tion potentials as a result of their dimethoxyTPA moieties. In
addition, the polymers displayed excellent stability of electrochro-
mic characteristics with coloration change from a colorless neutral
state to green and blue-purple oxidized states. These anodically
coloring polyamides showed high green coloration efficiency (CE
¼ 329 cm2/C), high contrast of optical transmittance change
(DT% ¼ 84% at 829 nm), and long-term redox reversibility. VC 2010

INTRODUCTION Electrochromism consists in the formation of
new optical transitions in an electroactive surface film or an
electroactive solute as the result of electrochemical oxidation
or reduction.1 This is an intriguing phenomenon for which
there might be a wide range of applications, including optical
switching devices, smart windows, memory elements, large-
area information panels, electronic papers (e-papers), and cha-
meleon materials.2–9 The earliest electrochromic materials in
the visible region were the inorganic compounds such as tung-
sten trioxide (WO3), iridium dioxide (IrO2), and nickel oxides
(NiO, Ni2O3).
10,11 Later, organic materials (i.e., viologens, metal-
lophthalocyanines, and conjugated polymers) have received
more attention than inorganics for electrochromic applications
because of the different colors observed with these compounds
while switching among their redox states.12–15 Among the avail-
able organic electrochromic materials, p-conjugated polymers
represented by polypyrrole and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio-
phene) (PEDOT) and their derivatives have received a great
deal of attention because of their ease of processability, fast
switching ability, high coloration efficiency and optical contrast
ratio, long-term redox stability, and wide range of colors.16–18
Aromatic polyamides are well-known high-performance poly-
mers with excellent mechanical and thermal properties.19
However, rigidity of the backbone and strong interchain
interactions result in high melting or glass transition temper-
atures (Tg) and limited solubility in most organic solvents.
These properties make them generally intractable or difficult
to process, thus restricting their wide-spread applications. To
overcome such a difficulty, polymer structure modification
becomes necessary. One of the common approaches for
increasing solubility and processability of aromatic polya-
mides without sacrificing high thermal stability is the intro-
duction of bulky, packing-disruptive groups into the polymer
backbone.20,21 We have demonstrated that aromatic polya-
mides containing bulky, propeller-shaped triphenylamine
(TPA) unit are amorphous, have good solubility in organic
solvents, and exhibit high mechanical property and thermal
stability.22 In recent years, TPA-based high-performance poly-
mers such as polyamides and polyimides with attractive
electrochromic properties have been reported in this study
and in the study by Liou et al.23 The electrochromic function
of these polymers originates from the electroactive TPA

Synthesis of Polyamides
The synthesis of polyamide 4a is used as an example to
illustrate the general synthetic route used to produce the
polyamides. A 50-mL round-bottom flask equipped with a
magnetic stirrer was charged with 0.5031 g (1.50 mmol) of
diamine momomer 2, 0.2492 g (1.50 mmol) of terephthalic
acid (3a), 1.5 mL of TPP, 2.5 mL of NMP, 0.8 mL of pyridine,
and 0.15 g of calcium chloride (CaCl2). The reaction mixture
was heated with stirring at 110 C for 3 h. The resulting
polymer solution was poured slowly into 200 mL of stirring
methanol giving rise to a stringy, fiber-like precipitate that
was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with hot
water and methanol, and dried. IR (film): 3298 cm1 (amide
NAH stretch), 1653 cm1 (amide C¼O stretch).
Preparation of the Polyamide Films
A polymer solution was made by the dissolution of about
0.7 g of the polyamide sample in 10 mL of hot DMAc. The
homogeneous solution was poured into a 9-cm glass Petri
dish, which was placed in a 90 C oven overnight for the
slow release of the solvent, and then the film was stripped
off from the glass substrate and further dried in vacuum at
160 C for 6 h. The obtained films were about 0.09-mm thick
and were used for X-ray diffraction measurements, solubility
tests, and thermal analyses.
Measurements
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 FT-
IR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in a Heraeus
VarioEL III CHNS elemental analyzer. 1H- and 13C-NMR spec-
tra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 500 FT-NMR system
with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The inherent
viscosities were determined with a Cannon-Fenske viscome-
ter at 30 C. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements
were performed at room temperature (25 C) on a Shi-
madzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer with a graphite mono-
chromator (operating at 40 kV and 30 mA), using nickel-fil-
tered Cu-Ka radiation (k ¼ 1.5418 Å). The scanning rate was
2/min over a range of 2y ¼ 10–40. DSC analyses were
performed on a Perkin–Elmer Pyris 1 DSC at a scan rate of
20 C/min in flowing nitrogen. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed with a Perkin–Elmer Pyris 1 TGA.
Experiments were carried out on approximately 4–6 mg of
samples heated in flowing nitrogen or air (flow rate ¼ 40
cm3/min) at a heating rate of 20 C/min. Thermomechanical
analysis (TMA) was determined with a Perkin–Elmer TMA 7
instrument. The TMA experiments were carried out from 50
to 350 C at a scan rate of 10 C/min with a penetration
probe 1.0 mm in diameter under an applied constant load of
10 mN. Softening temperatures (Ts) were taken as the onset
temperatures of probe displacement on the TMA traces.
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra of the polymer films
were recorded on a Jasco UV/VIS V530 spectrometer. Photo-
luminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary
Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. Electrochemistry
was performed with a CH Instruments 600C electrochemical
analyzer. Voltammograms are presented with the positive
potential pointing to the left and with increasing anodic cur-
rents pointing downward. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was con-
ducted with the use of a three-electrode cell in which ITO
(polymer films area about 0.7 cm  1.4 cm) was used as a
working electrode. A platinum wire was used as an auxiliary
electrode. All potentials were reported with respect to Ag/
AgCl electrode at room temperature under a nitrogen atmos-
phere. Ferrocene was used as an external reference for cali-
bration (þ0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl). An Agilent 8453 UV-Visible
photodiode array spectrophotometer was used to conduct
the spectroelectrochemical experiments. For the spectroelec-
trochemical studies, the polymer film cast on an ITO-coated
glass slide was immersed in 0.1 M TBAP/MeCN solution
using a UV-cuvette as a single-compartment cell equipped
with a Pt counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference
electrode.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Monomer Synthesis
According to a well-established synthetic method,25 the tar-
get TPA-based diamine monomer, 4,40-diamino-200,400-dime-
thoxytriphenylamine (2), was successfully synthesized by the
CsF-mediated double N-arylation reactions of 2,4-dimethox-
yaniline with two equivalent 4-fluoronitrobenzene, followed
by catalytic reduction of the intermediate dinitro derivative
1 using Pd/C and hydrazine in refluxing ethanol (Scheme 1).
The synthesized compounds 1 and 2 were fully character-
ized using elemental analysis and FTIR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-
NMR spectroscopy. FTIR spectra of these two compounds
are shown in Supporting Information Figure S1. The nitro

mine monomer 2.

The softening temperatures (Ts) of the polymer films were
determined with TMA by the penetration method. The Ts
value was read from the onset temperature of the probe dis-
placement on the TMA curve. Figure 2 shows a typical TMA
thermogram of polyamide 4e. The Ts values of the 4 series
polyamides are in the range from 238 to 280 C. In most
cases, the Ts values obtained by TMA are comparable to the
Tg values measured by the DSC experiments.
The thermal stability of polyamides was evaluated by TGA in
both air and nitrogen atmospheres. The Figure 2 inset
depicts a typical set of TGA curves for polyamide 4e in air
and in nitrogen. The decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5%
and 10% weight losses in nitrogen and air atmosphere were
taken from the original TGA thermograms and are given in
Table 1. All the polymers exhibited good thermal stability;
the Tds of polyamides 4a–h at a 10% weight loss were in
the range of 471–500 C in nitrogen and 482–549 C in air.
It is worthy to mention that in all cases, these polyamides
revealed a delayed decomposition in air than in nitrogen.
The reason is not clear at present. The amount of carbonized
residues (char yield) at 800 C in nitrogen for all polyamides
was in the range of 61–73 wt %. The high char yields of
these polyamides can be attributed to their high aromatic
content. Thus, the thermal analysis results revealed that
these polyamides exhibited excellent thermal stability, which
in turn is beneficial to increase the service time in device
application and enhance the morphological stability to the
spin-coated film.
Optical and Electrochemical Properties
The optical properties of the dimethoxyTPA-based poly-
amides 4a–h were investigated by UV–vis and photolumines-
cence (PL) spectroscopy, and the relevant data are presented
in Table 2. These polymers exhibited strong UV–vis absorp-
tion bands at 278–382 nm in NMP solution, assignable to
the p–p* transitions resulting from the conjugated dimethox-
yTPA segment. Their PL spectra in NMP solution showed
emission maximum around 445–468 nm (in the blue region),
with a very low fluorescence quantum yields of 0.33%–
0.77%. The absorption spectra of the polyamides in the solid
state are similar (a little red shifted) to those measured in
NMP solution. Optical band gap (Eg) determined from the
absorption edge of the solid-state spectra of polyamides are
found to be 2.58–3.02 eV.
The electrochemical properties of these polyamides were
investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the cast film on
an ITO-coated glass substrate as working electrode in dry
acetonitrile (MeCN) containing 0.1 M of TBAP as electrolyte
salt under nitrogen atmosphere. One pair of reversible redox
waves was observed in the first CV scan of these polymers.
Figure 3 shows a representative CV curve for polyamide 4d
recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The CV diagram indi-
cates two well-defined redox waves, with half-wave poten-
tials (E1/2) of 0.7 and 1.2 V. The first peak, at 0.82 V, can be
ascribed to oxidation of the electron-rich nitrogen atom in

potential could suggest an easier hole injection into films
from ITO electrodes in electronic device applications.
Spectroelectrochemical and Electrochromic Properties
The spectroelectrochemical properties of the polymer thin
films were monitored by a UV–vis spectrometer at different
applied potentials. The electrode preparations and solution
conditions were identical to those used in CV. The typical
absorption spectral changes of polyamide 4d are shown in
Figure 7. The polyamide 4d started to be oxidized at
about 0.6 V. When the applied potential was gradually
raised from 0.6 to 0.8 V, the absorption intensity at 337
nm slightly dropped, while a new peak at 397 nm and a
broadband having its maximum absorption wavelength at
829 nm appeared. The spectral changes were clearly due
to the formation of the radical cationic states of the poly-
amide 4d by electron removal from the lone pair on the
nitrogen atom on the TPA unit. On this oxidized state,
polyamide 4d absorbed in the regions below 450 nm and
above 550 nm with a valley (absorption minimum) at
450–550 nm, reflecting a green color. As the applied
potential was adjusted to 1.1 V or above, another absorp-
tion band originated from the dicationic dimethoxyTPA
moiety (see Scheme 3) showed up around 614 nm with a
concomitant decrease of absorption intensity at 397 nm.
These changes in electronic absorption spectra of 4d on
further oxidation were nicely reflected by color change
from green to a blue-purple color. These results indicated
the occurrence of a two-step oxidation sequence during
the oxidation of 4d. A similar spectral change was
observed for other polyamides of this series.
The film color of polyamide 4d turned into green and blue-
purple with high contrast of optical transmittance change

polymer films exhibited high coloration efficiency, high opti-
cal contrast ratio, reasonable response times, and long-term
redox and electrochromic reversibility. Thus, these polymers
may find optoelectronic applications as new hole-transport-
ing and electrochromic materials because of their proper
HOMO values and stable electrochromic behavior.

ABSTRACT: A new triphenylamine-based aromatic dicarboxylic
acid monomer, 4-tert-butyl-40,400-dicarboxytriphenylamine (2),
was synthesized from the cesium fluoride mediated N,N-diary-
lation reaction of 4-tert-butylaniline with 4-fluorobenzonitrile
and subsequent alkaline hydrolysis of the dinitrile intermedi-
ate. A series of six aromatic polyamides 4a-4f with tert-butyltri-
phenylamine groups was prepared from the newly synthesized
dicarboxylic acid and various aromatic diamines. These polya-
mides were readily soluble in many organic solvents and could
be solution-cast into flexible and strong films. The glass-transi-
tion temperatures of these polymers were in the range of 274–
311 C. These polymers exhibited strong UV-vis absorption
bands at 356–366 nm in NMP solution. Their photolumines-
cence spectra showed maximum bands around 433–466 nm in
the blue region. Cyclic voltammograms of all the polyamides
exhibited reversible oxidation redox couples in acetonitrile.
The polyamide 4f, with tert-butyltriphenylamine segment in
both diacid and diamine residues, exhibited stable electrochro-
mic characteristics with a color change from a colorless neutral
form, through a green semioxidized form, to a deep purple
fully oxidized form. VC 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci

INTRODUCTION Triarylamines are an important class of aro-
matics because they are easily oxidized to form stable ami-
nium cation radicals. In view of their stability, triarylamine
cation radicals have become promising spin-containing units
for exploitation of potential organic magnetic materials.1–5
Perhaps most commonly, triarylamine derivatives have been
used as the hole-transport and/or light-emitting materials in
electroluminscent devices.6–10 Most of triarylamine deriva-
tives are used as vapor-deposited thin films, or composite
materials dispersed in an inert polymer binder. It is, how-
ever, difficult to maintain long-term morphological stability
due to crystallization or phase separation. One of the meth-
ods to overcome this drawback could be the incorporation of
triarylamine units into the polymer backbone or into its side
chains.11–15 The extensive investigations on the polymeric
materials have shown the possibility of enhancing the
device performance due to the increased morphological sta-
bility.16–20 In addition, the uses of polymeric materials
exhibit another advantages, such as good processability and
variety of possible chemical modification.21–26
Wholly aromatic polyamides are characterized as highly ther-
mally stable polymers with a favorable balance of physical
and chemical properties. However, rigidity of the backbone
and strong hydrogen bonding results in high melting or
glass-transition temperatures (Tgs) and limited solubility in
most organic solvents.27,28 These properties make them gen-
erally intractable or difficult to process, thus restricting their
applications. To overcome such a difficulty, polymer structure
modification becomes necessary. It has been reported that
aromatic polyamides bearing the propeller-shaped triphenyl-
amine (TPA) unit in the main chain were amorphous
and easily soluble in organic solvents and they could be
solution-cast into flexible films with good mechanical prop-
erty and high thermal stability.29–31 In recent years, we
have demonstrated that TPA-based polymers are promising
hole-transporting and electrochromic materials for optoelec-
tronic applications due to the electroactive TPA units.32–42 It
has also been reported in our previous publications36,41,42
that the incorporation of electron-donating substituents
such as tert-butyl and methoxy groups on the electro-
chemically active sites of the TPA unit resulted in stable
TPA cationic radicals and decreased oxidation potential, lead-
ing to a significantly enhanced redox and electrochromic
stability of the prepared polyamides. In an effort to extend
our work to the design and synthesis of electrochromic high-
performance polymers, herein we wish to synthesize a new

Infrared spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 FTIR
spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in a Perkin–
Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were
measured on a Bruker AVANCE 500 FT-NMR system. The in-
herent viscosities were determined with a Cannon-Fenske
viscometer at 30 C. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)
measurements were performed at room temperature (25
C) on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer (40 kV, 30
mA), using nickel-filtered Cu-Ka radiation (k ¼ 1.5418 Å).
The scanning rate was 2 /min over a range of 2h ¼ 10–40.
A universal tester LLOYD LRX with a load cell 5 kg was used
to study the stress-strain behavior of the samples. A gauge
length of 2 cm and a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min were
used for this study. Measurements were performed at room
temperature with film specimens (0.5 cm width, 6 cm
length), and an average of at least three individual determi-
nations was reported. Thermogravimentric analysis (TGA)
was conducted with a Perkin–Elmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experi-
ments were carried out on approximately 3–5 mg of samples
heated in flowing nitrogen or air (gas flow rate ¼ 40 cm3/
min) at a heating rate of 20 C/min. DSC analyses were per-
formed on a Perkin–Elmer Pyris 1 DSC at a scan rate of 20
C/min in flowing nitrogen. Thermomechanical analysis
(TMA) was conducted with a Perkin–Elmer TMA 7 instru-
ment. The TMA experiments were conducted from 50 to 350
C at a scan rate of 10 C/min with a penetration probe 1.0
mm in diameter under an applied constant load of 10 mN.
Softening temperatures (Ts) were taken as the onset temper-
atures of probe displacement on the TMA traces. Ultraviolet-
visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the polymer films were recorded
on an Agilent 8453 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Electro-
chemistry was performed with a CH Instruments 611C elec-
trochemical analyzer. Voltammograms are presented with the
positive potential pointing to the left and with increasing an-
odic currents pointing downwards. Cyclic voltammetry was
conducted with the use of a three-electrode cell in which
ITO (polymer films area ca. 0.8 cm 1.25 cm) was used as a
working electrode. A platinum wire was used as an auxiliary
electrode. All cell potentials were taken with the use of a
homemade Ag/AgCl, KCl (sat.) reference electrode. Ferrocene
was used as an external reference calibration (þ0.44 V vs.
Ag/AgCl). Spectroelectrochemistry analyses were carried out
with an electrolytic cell whcih was composed of a 1 cm cuv-
ette, ITO as a working electrode, a platinum wire as an
auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
Absorption spectra in the spectroelectrochemical experi-
ments were measured with an Agilent 8453 UV-Visible diode
array spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra
were measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Monomer Synthesis
As depicted in Scheme 1, the new aromatic dicarboxylic acid
2 was successfully synthesized by the alkaline hydrolysis
reaction of the dinitrile compound 1, which was obtained
from the condensation reaction of 4-tert-butylaniline with 4-
fluorobenzonitrile in DMSO in the presence of sodium
hydride. IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic techniques
were used to identify the structures of the intermediate dini-
trile compound 1 and the targeted dicarboxylic acid mono-
mer 2. The IR spectrum (see Supporting Information Fig. S1)
of dinitrile compound 1 gave a characteristic absorption
peak at 2217 cm1 (C:N stretching). After hydrolysis, the
characteristic absorption of the cyano group disappeared,
and the carboxylic acid group showed a typical carbonyl
absorption band at 1686 cm1 (C¼O stretching) together
with the appearance of broad bands around 2700–3400
cm1 (OAH stretching). The structures of 1 and 2 were also
confirmed by high-resolution NMR spectra. The 1H and 13C
NMR spectra of these compounds are illustrated in Figures 1

monomer 2.

Polymer Properties
Organo-Solubility and Film Property
The solubility properties of the polyamides in several organic
solvents at 10% (w/v) are also reported in Table 1. All the
polymers exhibited good solubility in a variety of dipolar sol-
vents such as NMP, DMAc, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature or
upon heating at 80 C. They were also soluble in phenol-
type solvents such as m-cresol; however, they were insoluble
in less polar solvents like THF. From the diffraction patterns
shown in Supporting Information Figure S3, the X-ray diffrac-
tion studies of the polyamides indicated that all the poly-
mers are essentially amorphous. The excellent solubility and
amorphous nature of these polyamides can be attributed to
the increased free volume caused by the introduction of the
three-dimensional TPA moiety and bulky pendent tert-butyl
substituents into the backbone. Thus, the excellent solubility
makes these polymers as potential candidates for practical
applications by low-cost spin-coating or inkjet-printing pro-
cesses. The mechanical properties of the polymer films are
summarized in Supporting Information Table S2. They had
a tensile strength of 85–97 MPa, an elongation at break of
7–10%, and a tensile modulus of 2.1–2.6 GPa, indicating
strong and tough polymeric materials.
Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of the polyamides were investigated
by TGA, DSC and TMA. The results are summarized in Table
2. The glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of all the 4 series
polymers were observed in the range 274–311 C by DSC.
Polyamide 4e showed the highest Tg due to the presence of
rigid 9,9-diphenylfluorene unit. The softening temperatures
(Ts) of the polymer film samples were determined by the
TMA method with a loaded penetration probe. They were
obtained from the onset temperature of the probe displace-
ment on the TMA trace. A typical TMA trace of polyamide 4a
is illustrated in Figure 5. In almost all cases, the Ts values
obtained by TMA are comparable to the Tg values measured

films were also measured for optical transparency using UV-
vis spectroscopy, and the cutoff wavelengths (absorption
edge; konset) were recorded in the range of 406–432 nm
(Supporting Information Fig. S4).
Electrochemical Properties
The redox behavior of these polyamides was investigated by
cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the cast films on an ITO-coated
glass substrate as working electrode in 0.1 M TBAP/acetoni-
trile (CH3CN) solution. The redox potentials of the poly-
amides as well as their highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
energy levels (below vacuum) are also listed in Table 3.
Figure 8(b) depicts the CV curve of polyamide 4e, which was
representative for the other polyamides 4a to 4d. Polyamide
4e exhibited a single and well-defined reversible redox cou-
ple, with oxidation half-wave potential (E1/2) at 1.14 V ver-
sus Ag/AgCl, when the potential was scanned between 0.0
and 1.4 V. We noted that the color of polyamide 4e film
changed from colorless to pale blue upon oxidation. Polya-
mides 4a-4d showed very similar CV curves to that of 4e,
with E1/2 values ranging from 1.15 to 1.18 V. It is notewor-
thy to mention that changing the diamine structure did
not significantly affect the oxidation of the TPA cores of
polymers 4a-4e. It is also can be seen that the oxidation of
polyamides 4a-4e is less facile than that of analogues based
on 4,40-diamino-400-tert-butyltriphenylamine (E1/2 ¼ 0.80–
0.85 V)34 owing to the electron-withdrawing effect of the
remaining carbonyl groups that destabilize the cationic radi-
cal species. Nevertheless, CV measurements show that poly-
mers 4a-4e undergo a reversible process, reflecting high oxi-
dation stability, due to the substitution of tert-butyl group.
For the 40 series polyamides (see Table 3), they generally
possessed an irreversible redox behavior in the anodic oxida-
tive scanning. Thus, the good elelctrochemical redox revers-
ibility for the 4 series polymers confirms that para-substitu-
tion of the tert-butyl group on the TPA unit results in an
enhanced stability to the radical cation species. In general,
the present series polyamides revealed a similar redox sta-
bility to that of the methoxy-substituted analogs reported
previously.35
As can be seen from Figure 8(c), polyamide 4f exhibits two
redox amino centers in each repeat unit and shows two cor-
responding well-defined, quasi-reversible anodic redox cou-
ples. The first oxidation at E1/2 ¼ 0.85 V appears to involve
one electron loss from the TPA unit in the diamine residue,
and the second oxidation wave (E1/2 ¼ 1.27 V) is related to
the electron loss from the TPA unit in the diacid residue. In
fact, the first oxidation potential is found to be similar to
those of polyamides derived from diamine 3f and conven-
tional aromatic dicarboxylic acids.34 A clear coloration
change was also observed for the film of 4f upon oxidation,
from colorless to green and then to purple.
The external ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fcþ) rodox standard
has E1/2 at 0.44 V versus Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile. Under the
assumption that the HOMO level for the ferrocene standard
was 4.80 eV with respective to the zero vacuum level, the

new broad absorption band around 703 nm started to inten-
sify due to the cation radical formation. As shown in the
inset of Figure 9, polyamide 4e is almost colorless in the
neutral state and pale blue in the oxidized state. Electrochro-
mic switching studies were performed to monitor the
absorbance changes as a function of time and to determine
the switching time of the polymer at its absorption maxi-
mum by stepping potential repeatedly between the neutral
and oxidized states. The switching time was defined as the
time that was required to reach 90% of the full change in
absorbance after switching potential because it is difficult to
perceive any further color change with naked eye beyond
this point. Thin films from polyamide 4e would require 4.4 s
at 1.35 V for reaching 90% absorbance at 703 nm and 2.7 s
for bleaching. After several successive switchings between
0.0 and 1.35 V, the polymer films still exhibited fast response
time and good redox and electrochromic stability (Fig. 10).
In addition, spectroelectrochemistry of polyamide 4f was
also investigated. As displayed in Figure 11, in the neutral
form, at 0 V, the film exhibited strong absorption at wave-
length around 366 nm due to p–p* transition of the polymer,
but it was almost transparent in the visible region. Upon oxi-
dation of the 4f film (increasing applied voltage from 0 to
1.0 V), the intensity of the absorption peak at 366 nm gradu-
ally decreased while a new broadband having its maximum
absorption wavelength at 805 nm gradually increased in
intensity. We attribute this spectral change to the formation
of a stable monocation radical originating from the oxidation
of the amino center in the diamine residue of polymer 4f.
Further increase the applied electric potential to 1.55 V led
to the drop of the absorption intensity at 805 nm with the
concomitant increase of the intensity at 539 and 709 nm.
This spectral change indicated the occurrence of the second
oxidation arising from another TPA unit in the diacid compo-
nent. The observed absorption changes in the film of 4f at
various potentials are fully reversible and are associated
with strong color changes; indeed, they even can be seen
readily by the naked eye. From the inset shown in Figure 11,
it can be seen that the film of 4f switches from a transmis-
sive neutral state (almost colorless) to a highly absorbing
semioxidized state (green) and a fully oxidized state

experiments revealed that the introduction of the tert-butyl
group at the active sites of the TPA unit enhances the redox
and electrochromic stability of these polymers.
CONCLUSIONS
A series of new polyamides 4a–f with tert-butyl-substituted
triphenylamine units were successfully prepared from 4-tert-
butyl-40,400-dicarboxytriphenylamine and various aromatic
diamines via the phosphorylation polyamidation reaction.
The polyamides exhibit good solubility and film-forming
capability and high thermal stability, and all of them are fluo-
rescent with blue-light emission. The polymers display very
well-defined and reversible redox processes in acetonitrile
solutions. Furthermore, they possess electrochomic behavior.
The polyamide 4f containing the tert-butyltriphenylamine
unit in both diacid and diamine components shows multi-
electrochromic behavior: colorless in the neutral state, green
in the semioxidized state, and purple in the fully oxidized
state. Good redox and electrochromic stability, moderate
fluorescence intensity, and proper HOMO values of these
polyamides make them promising candidates for optoelec-
tronic applications.
