0. Self-evaluation of the Research Project 
This research was successfully conducted. Based on this project, two journal 
papers have been submitted to J. of Construction Engineering and Management for 
review. Sections 2 and 3 form the major content of the first paper submitted. The second 
paper submitted is based on sections 4 through 6 in this paper. This project also 
supported a PhD student to complete her PhD dissertation and trained several Master 
students.

et al. (2004), strategic alliances in the construction industry can provide some direct 
benefits including reduced risk, improved quality, reduced cost, completion on time and 
reduce work at the project level. In construction, strategic alliances are considered one 
of the major entry modes for the internationalization of firms and play an important role 
in the strategic planning of international firms. 
Research on construction alliances has focused on issues such as: (1) rationales and 
benefits behind international construction alliances (Badger and Mullign 1995; Sillars 
and Kangari 1997); (2) governance structures of construction alliances (Ngowi 2007, 
Chen 2005); (3) performance or organizational success in alliances or joint ventures 
(Mohamed 2003; Sillars and Kangari 2004). In construction, the number of international 
joint ventures (IJVs) is growing rapidly, especially in developing countries, where 
ICJVs serve to satisfy the needs for national development and at the same time to 
prevent the economy from being dominated by foreign investors (Mohamed 2003). Due 
to the recent trend of utilizing ICJVs, international construction firms are faced with 
challenging decisions concerning ICJVs at an increasing frequency. Among these 
decisions, the choice of governance structure has a profound impact on the JV 
performance, but receives few attentions. Chen (2005) studies the entry modes for 
international construction markets and develops a model for entry mode selection. Work 
by Ngowi (2007) investigates how trust plays a crucial role in governance structure 
decisions. Ngowi (2007) defines two governance structures in construction alliances: 
joint ventures and partnering. He maintains that, based on the transaction costs rationale, 
partner trustworthiness encourages the use of partnering while partners without 
sufficient mutual trust tend to adopt joint ventures. Ngowi’s conclusion is generally 
consistent with the theoretic and empirical work in organization literature. One of the 
most discussed alliance governance issues in literature is the choice between equity 
 6
JMJ jointly share profits and risks and the JV officers make most decisions, which will 
be followed by all partners. Closer coordination and more frequent communications are 
extended to all levels of a JV organization. This paper aims to develop a theoretic 
framework of ICJV’s organizational control strategy to better organizational 
performance. 
Although organizational literature does not address the choice of organizational 
control structures in ICJVs directly, the rich theories in literature serve as the 
foundations for developing the governance model for ICJVs. First, based on 
transaction-cost economics (TCE), minimization of transaction costs is considered a key 
mechanism in determining organizational governance (Gulati and Singh 1998); however, 
costs are not the only factors that stand to influence such decisions. Firm competence or 
capabilities also play a critical role in alliance governance. According to resource-based 
view (RBV), as a resource owner, a firm’s ability to create, appropriate, and sustain 
value from the owned resources is partly dependent on the firm’s ability to access the 
complementary resources and how well the resources are protected and exploited.  
This is why Williamson (1999), one of the most influential scholars in developing TCE, 
calls for more research into investigating how existing firm capabilities influence 
governance. In this paper, we attempt to address how the RBV can complement the 
standard TCE approach to governance choice. With the dual theoretical lens, this study 
analyzes factors that influence firms’ control and the choice of organizational forms of 
ICJVs and develops an integrated model. 
The organization of the remaining sections is as follows. Sections 2 and 3 present an 
integrated conceptual framework for the ICJVs’ choices of organizational control 
structure. Sections 4 through 6 are the empirical study using a rigorous case study 
methodology.

venture entity to behave in a manner that achieves partner objectives and satisfactory 
performance” (Inkpen and Currall 2004).  
Moreover, since joint ventures involve shared ownership, partner’s relative 
ownership or equity shares are often considered a proxy of the joint venture control. Yet, 
this intuitive proxy appears to be somewhat oversimplified given the complexity of joint 
ventures. A representative empirical work by Mjoen and Tallman (1997) rejects the 
traditional governance hypothesis that “relies strictly on ownership share to delineate 
the degree of control.” They maintain that ownership is but one of the control 
mechanisms among others such as right of veto or partner’s technical superiority, and 
that “selective control” over some critical activities or resources is often more effective 
and desirable than overall control. Therefore, in order to more accurately identify and 
define the governance structures of ICJVs, we shall emphasize more on the governance 
structure taxonomy that focus on control. 
Organizational Control Structures of ICJVs: Jointly Managed JV (JMJ) and Separately 
Managed JV (SMJ) 
Geringer and Hebert (1989) argue that there are three dimensions of control: the 
mechanisms of control, the extent of control, and the focus of control. The mechanisms 
of control are not limited to ownership and may include other options such as the JV 
board of directors, formal agreements, JV planning process, and reporting relationships, 
etc. The extent of control over an IJV refers to the decision-making process in terms of 
the degree of centralization. The focus of control emphasizes selective or specific 
control over critical resources or activities and such control is more realistic and 
effective than hoping to control the entire JVs.

each firm; (2) JV management team making major decisions, which will be followed by 
all partners; (3) the needs for coordination and communication being extended to all 
levels of a JV organization. On the other hand, SMJ is characterized by (1) each firm 
being technically and financially responsible for its assigned tasks, which are often 
negotiated; (2) each firm making most decisions related to the assigned tasks without 
the needs of consent from other JV partners; (3) the needs for coordination and 
communication being limited to higher level managers and are minimum for individuals. 
We do not consider that the governance structure of an ICJV will be on the extreme side 
of either JMJ or a SMJ. The actual governance structures of ICJVs should be 
characterized by a spectrum between the two extremes. Therefore, when JMJ is 
proposed to be a preferred control structure in this paper, we mean that the structure on 
the spectrum closer to JMJ side is preferred. 
In contrast, JMJ may seem to be more hierarchical than SMJ. Nevertheless, JMJ 
should not be considered equivalent to the “hierarchy” structure used in organization 
literature, particularly in the TCE literature. The major reason is that the typical 
“hierarchy” structure focuses mainly on the unified ownership as discussed above and, 
for this reason, is weak in differentiating the control of joint ventures (Mjoen and 
Tallman 1997). Since equity joint venture is typically considered a hierarchy structure in 
organization literature, the concern of choices between JMJ and SMJ in international 
equity joint venture should be more precisely regarded as the control structure choices 
under the hierarchy type of alliances. We submit that the differentiation of these two 
control structures, namely, JMJ and SMJ, are significant in the ICJV governance.

and its partners becomes one of the rare, valuable, immobile and non-substitutable 
resources, leading to a long-lived competitive advantage. For example, firms in an ICJV 
often seek partners with particular resources worth learning (e.g., technical capabilities 
or knowledge regarding local market) in pursuit of competitive advantage. Mowery et al. 
(1998) also highlight the importance of knowledge complementarities and 
partner-specific absorptive capacity in the partner choice decision. Furthermore, the 
competence perspective of RBV contends that alliances often aim at expanding 
partnering firms’ distinctive capabilities through interorganizational learning. In order to 
effectively support such competence enhancing processes, alliance partners rely on 
more sophisticated and integrated coordination mechanisms, rather than simple 
ownership pooling.  
The discussion above highlights the complementary nature between RBV and TCE 
regarding the governance structures of alliances. This paper thus argues that an 
integrated framework fusing traditional TCE and recent RBV together could provide a 
more comprehensive explanation of the governance structure choices of ICJVs. The 
integrated model proposed in this paper is illustrated in Fig.1, depicting our 
corresponding four propositions. In the following sections, we shall derive and discuss 
each of the propositions. 
[Insert Figure 1 here] 
TCE Perspective: Contract-based Determinants of Governance Choice  
Under TCE, governance forms that minimize the costs of exchange arising from 
uncertainty and asset specificity are considered efficient (Williamson 1985). Although 
scholars who hold traditional views like Williamson (1985) may see opportunism by 
 14
of “hierarchy,” and they conclude that “equity” joint ventures are preferable to 
“non-equity” alliances given greater cultural distance. Nevertheless, such conclusion 
does not necessarily lead to the use of JMJ. To begin with, the choice of JMJ or SMJ 
concerns the control of equity joint ventures, not the hierarchy or market choice. More 
specifically, the decision of JMJ or SMJ is made by holding the ownership structure of a 
joint venture fixed. Second, the rationale behind the belief that hierarchy can reduce 
transaction cost is due to the co-alignment of incentives through unified ownership 
(Sengupta and Perry 1997), rather than hierarchical management. Therefore, a more 
precise statement of a typical TCE view on alliances is that high transaction costs will 
call for the use of alliances that are characterized by higher co-ownership. As for the 
choice of JMJ or SMJ, we shall examine the transaction costs under different control 
structures. 
In the following discussion, we share the broader view held by Matthews (1986) 
that transaction costs are the overheads of conducting a set of transactions. The question 
is: under different levels of cultural distance, what control structure minimizes 
transaction costs? Buckley and Casson (1996) maintains that “cultural homogeneity, 
acting through shared beliefs, reduces transactions costs by avoiding misunderstand…” 
In contrast, if the cultural difference is large, it should be comparatively costly to jointly 
manage a JV because there will be a lack of shared beliefs and values. Since the JMJ 
structure involves much higher degrees of coordination and communication, larger 
cultural difference will naturally increase the difficulty of collaboration and potential 
conflicts significantly. Therefore, following this logic, the SMJ, characterized by 
divided responsibility and minimal coordination and communication, can reduce the 
conflicts and costs of coordination that arise from organizational cultural differences.  
This phenomenon is commonly observed in the control of international subsidiaries or 
 16
belief that a partner will not take advantage of other partners (Powell 1990). Therefore, 
trust can also be considered as reliability, an important expectation of the partner in the 
alliance. 
Based on the broader view of transaction costs (Matthews 1986), higher trust will 
reduce many transaction costs such as monitoring, outcome verification, and 
communication, etc. Therefore, when the level of trust is low, it should be 
comparatively expensive to jointly manage a joint venture and the partners will search 
for the best possible way to divide their tasks and corresponding responsibilities; that is, 
SMJ will be a better control structure in this case. Note that this conclusion does not 
contradict to the classic TCE based proposition or Ngowi’s proposition that “hierarchy” 
structure is a better choice when trust level is low, because, as we’ve shown in section 2, 
SMJ is not defined in terms of ownership structure and, thus, is not equivalent to the 
“market” structure in TCE literature. Taking the control perspective of governance, we 
submit that if the contracting firm has a higher level of trust toward other partners, JMJ, 
characterized by closer collaborations and more risk sharing, will be a more economic 
form for ICJVs in achieving their JV objectives. 
A distinctive characteristic in the construction industry that reinforces the 
importance of trust is that, compared to the JVs in other industries, the reputation of 
each JV partner is tied up with the success or failure of the JV and the reputation impact 
is dependent on the control structure. When JMJ is adopted, the reputation impact will 
be more on all JV partners rather than on individual partners, yet when SMJ is adopted, 
it is easier for clients to identify who is responsible for the failure of the JV. In 
conclusion, if there is insufficient trust among partners, SMJ may be a better choice as it 
reduces the reputation related transactions costs and encourages each individual to take 
its responsibility.  
 18
The major procured items may include materials, subcontractors’ work, and equipments. 
Particularly in construction industry, the success of a contracting firm lies in its 
capability to acquire inputs at the best price, quality, and reliability (Warszawski 1996).  
Thus, the procurement strategy or capability could become a major source of the 
competitive advantage of a construction firm. From the resource-based view (RBV), the 
procurement advantage may represent an intangible resource of a construction firm.  
The accumulation and utilization of such intangible resource can influence the 
long-term competitive advantages of the firm. When the exploitation of procurement 
advantage is considered crucial to a partner’s profitability, the partner would tend to 
require more flexibility or fewer restrictions imposed by other partners toward the 
procurement for the project. They may center on higher flexibility in choosing their own 
subcontractors or suppliers, and demand more independence between partners. This can 
be understood from the “focus” dimension of control argued previously. That is, when 
profits from procurement advantage are strategically important to a partnering firm, it is 
desirable to balance the control through various procurement arrangements, where each 
partner has focused control over specific procurement scope. For example, 
procurements can be decentralized and divided according to dollar amount, assigned 
tasks, or each partner’s comparative purchase advantage; alternatively, procurement can 
also be jointly made with higher priority given to each partner’s preferred suppliers. 
In SMJ, each firm makes most decisions related to the assigned tasks without the 
needs of consent from other JV partners. Each partner is financially responsible for 
specific tasks, including procurement. Under these circumstances, contracting firms that 
emphasize more on procurement autonomy would prefer to adopt SMJ as the control 
structure. The third hypothesis for the choice of governance structure in ICJVs is 
proposed as follows. 
 20
approach to obtaining new knowledge and skills in the construction industry, learning is 
often naturally achieved under joint operation and management even though the partner 
with advanced knowledge may not intend to transfer the knowledge. This is also why 
the motivation for learning does not have to be “mutual,” because the learning can often 
be achieved without mutual consent. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of 
contracting firms’ resources, some firms in ICJVs may not have the needs to internalize 
other partners’ knowledge. For instance, firms may participate in ICJVs primarily for 
entering a new or unfamiliar market, instead of internalizing particular technology or 
complementary resources. Therefore, from the organizational control perspective, when 
learning is not an objective of an ICJV or the needs to internalize complementary 
resources are low, the control through advanced technology or capability will be 
emphasized and partners may prefer SMJ as the control structure. When learning is an 
objective of an ICJV, the needs to protect certain resources are lower and the objective 
to internalize complementary resources is easier to be achieved through jointly 
managing the joint venture. The last proposition is given as follows. 
Proposition 4: An ICJV with stronger motivation in partners for learning is more likely 
to adopt JMJ, while an ICJV where partners are less motivated in learning is more 
likely to adopt SMJ. 
4. Case Study Design 
Case Studies as an Empirical Inquiry and a Research Methodology 
Case study is often misunderstood and, thus, wrongly applied and conducted. Case 
 22
selected because: 1) the project had 8 ICJVs to be analyzed, 2) the 8 JVs were in the 
same project environment, presumably providing a better controlled environment, 3) 
both types of ICJV governance structures were presented, and 4) the problem of data 
accessibility is not an issue in this project. Regarding data accessibility, we would like 
to stress that since the nature of the hypothesized determinants and our concerns toward 
ICJVs are considered very sensitive by most construction firms, finding top managers as 
our respondents and obtaining trust from respondents are both difficult and critical to 
the success of study. Fortunately, in the THSR project, we find channels to help us 
connect with the right people and earn trust from them in order to conduct in-depth 
interviews and data collection. Although multiple-case studies in general provide more 
compelling evidence than a single-case study, we decided to conduct this single-case 
study because it encompassed 8 units of analysis, each of which could be regarded a 
typical case of an ICJV.  
• Data collection and reliability 
Since there were limited public data related to the hypothesized determinants, we had to 
heavily rely on the data that were obtained during interviews, including the event 
descriptions and the potentially subjective opinions/judgments from the respondents.   
We verified the data from interviews by cross-referencing them to ensure the reliability 
of data. For example, comments or answers from one party were often compared with 
that from different parties, including a third party, e.g., the project owner. We conducted 
interviews with twelve top managers associated with the JV partnering firms and three 
top managers from the client, the THSR Inc., following a preplanned interview protocol.  
The protocol is designed to obtain 1) relevant background or numeric information, 2) 
the assessments of the hypothesized determinants and the organizational control 
 24
Although officially there were more than 8 JVs, we combined some of them. Table 1 
shows the major 8 JVs after excluding those partnering firms that either withdrew from 
a JV at very early stage or had insignificant equity shares. Table 2 shows the budgeted 
costs of each contract, the equity ratios invested by each JV partner, and each partner’s 
number of members in the JV board.  
[Insert Tables 1 and 2 here] 
Among all JVs, the two JVs that adopted SMJ were the JV in C220 and that in C280. 
The three partners in C220 JV were: Daiho, responsible for the tunnel engineering, Chiu 
Tai, responsible for the foundation, and Kou Kai, responsible for the bridge engineering.  
However, during the construction, Chiu Tai and Kou Kai withdrew because of their 
financial distresses. As for the C280 JV, each of the three JV partners was technically 
and financially responsible for a specified length of civil works. Other than C220 and 
C280, it is worth noting that in C230/C240 JV, a jointly managed JV, the local partner 
Chung Lin withdrew from the JV after partnering for over one year. We shall explain 
later from the perspective of proposed model what may contribute to the dissolution of 
C230/C240 JV.  
Analysis of the Determinants in Each JV 
Here we shall explain and summarize our analysis of the governance structure 
determinant in each ICJV. In Section 4, we shall examine whether the decision for 
governance structure is consistent with proposed propositions. The assessment of the 
levels of each decisional variable is based on the descriptions, explanations, comments, 
and sometimes direct evaluations of the determinants from the respondents. In the 
following analysis, readers may consider to read thoroughly the explanation of 
 26
Assessment of “Trust” in each JV 
Table 4 summarizes the analysis of trust among partners in each JV. The level of trust is 
assessed by each JV’s bases for the trust and the interviewees’ comments. Here “trust” 
is regarded as the “ex-ante” belief toward other partners. We find that many firms 
exhibited much lower ex-post trust after the “honeymoon” period of cooperation.  
Many factors, such as miscommunication, unrealistic expectation, poor management, or 
even cultural difference, could contribute to the disappointment toward others and the 
loss of trust. Since the interviewees’ evaluations of the trust might be confused with 
their ex-post experiences, we repeatedly reminded the respondents to evaluate the 
ex-ante trust level. In the study, we use the “bases of trust” to serve as a more objective 
criterion to corroborate with the respondents’ evaluation. 
Table 4 shows the levels of trust in all JVs are at least moderate, indicating that trust 
may be a very basic requirement in forming a JV. Furthermore, good reputation and 
upbeat experiences of past cooperation are the most crucial ingredients for a high level 
of mutual trust. On the other hand, none of the JVs that adopt SMJ have a high level of 
mutual trust. Nevertheless, all interviewees agreed that trust is an important determinant 
of governance structure choices. 
[Insert Table 4 here] 
 
Assessment of “Needs for Procurement Autonomy” in each JV 
The data obtained from the interview regarding this determinant were not satisfactory, 
mainly because respondents considered the procurement strategy a sensitive issue, more 
 28
inefficient. Not surprisingly, all interviewees agree that the needs for procurement 
autonomy are an important determinant of governance structure choices. 
Assessment of “Motivation for Learning” in each JV 
Table 6 summarizes the analysis of motivation for learning in each JV. The major 
criteria for assessing the level of learning motivation are 1) whether learning is 
considered an objective of joining the JV, and 2) what to be learned. As shown in Table 
6, most JVs adopting JMJ considered learning an objective of joining the JV: while 
foreign partners focus more on the learning of culture, business practice, suppliers and 
subcontractors in Taiwan, local partners emphasize more on learning specific 
technologies/skills or project management. All interviewees, except for those of C250 
and C280, agreed that the motivation for learning is an important determinant of 
governance structure choices. 
[Insert Table 6 here] 
6. Case Analysis: Evidence and Model Evaluation 
The purpose of this section is to explicate the assessment of the determinants in five 
selected JVs and to evaluate how the case evidences support the proposed model.  
Note that, in this section, since we will use the results previously tabulated in Section 3, 
readers are suggested to cross reference this section with Tables 1 through 6 for clarity. 
Analysis of C210/C215 JV 
 30
Both partners considered that they had good relationships with their suppliers and each 
partner had different purchasing advantages. Obayashi was assigned to the procurement 
of certain special equipments from Japan, and Fu Tsu was assigned to the procurement 
of certain batch materials from Taiwan. Those that did not fall into the two categories 
were jointly purchased following a transparent procedure, and the negotiation efforts 
were reasonably small. To conclude, the division of procurement and the limited efforts 
for negotiation indicate a moderate level of needs for procurement autonomy.   
• High assessed level of motivation for learning 
Although Obayashi led the construction of tunnels and Fu Tsu led the construction of 
viaducts, both partners considered learning from the other partner, an objective of this 
JV. Since Fu Tsu, the local partner, had no experience in tunneling, they were highly 
motivated to learn tunneling techniques from experienced Obayashi. On the other hand, 
Obayashi aimed to learn the procurement practice, market information, and human 
resource information in Taiwan to prepare for operating their new business in Mainland 
China. In order to facilitate their learning, according to the respondents, “they purposely 
mixed both partners’ employees in work teams and arranged frequent routine meetings 
before and after work every day so as to not only promptly resolve problems 
encountered but also provide platforms for learning.” Obviously, the JMJ structure is the 
one that provides such close working relationship and learning environment.  
 
• Remarks 
Based on the analysis of the four determinants, the adoption of JMJ in this JV supports 
the proposed propositions. Particularly, the low level of cultural difference, high level of 
trust, and high level of motivation for learning strongly suggest the use of JMJ. 
 32
Chung Lin was only a relatively small construction firm that has little experience in 
heavy civil construction experiences. According to the interview, “trust was mainly 
based on credit information.” Compared to other JVs such as those in C210/C215 and 
C291/296, where partners had much stronger bases for their trust as shown in Table 4, 
the level of trust between Hyundai and Chung Lin was considered moderate. 
• High assessed level of needs for procurement autonomy: 
Similar to the arrangement in C210/C215, the procurement included both divided and 
joint procurements. However, since the local partner was highly concerned with the 
joint procurement decision, its representing manager was not adequately delegated to 
make those joint decisions, causing excessively high negotiation efforts. In fact, the 
high negotiation efforts clearly indicated the needs for more divided procurements, 
which can be easily achieved under SMJ structure. 
• High assessed level of motivation for learning 
During the formation of the JV in C230/C240, both parties had relatively strong 
motivations to learn from each other. As a newcomer in Taiwan’s construction market, 
“Hyundai is eager to learn Taiwan’s culture, management style, information of local 
subcontractors, etc.” During the first year’s cooperation, according to Hyundai, “many 
staffs cooperated with Chung Lin and were well guided by Chung Lin in learning how 
to conduct business in Taiwan.” Meanwhile, due to its limited experiences in heavy 
construction, Chung Lin was interested in gaining project experiences and certain skills 
in tunneling and viaduct construction. It turns out that their high-leveled motivation for 
learning is the only hypothesized factor that supports the use of JMJ in this JV. 
• Remarks 
As mentioned above, the cooperation among the partners was not very smooth, and 
 34
Korea and has fewer experiences in heavy civil construction. In Korea, the business 
relationship between Doosan and Samsung was that of a client and contractor. 
According to the respondent, “the new type of liaison as partnering contractors and their 
different engineering backgrounds seemed to create considerable difference in terms of 
corporate values and business practice, such as how to conduct business and how to 
manage projects.” Such cultural difference was further intensified “by the strong 
characters presented in the top managers of the two firms.” This case also gives a 
perfect example in which cultural difference can be significant between partners from 
the same country.  
• Moderate assessed level of trust 
Trust among Samsung and IE&C is “based on their good experiences of cooperation in 
the Taipei Metropolitan Rapid Transit project around ten years ago.” However, since 
IE&C was only a midsize construction firm in Taiwan, IE&C invited another Korean 
partner, Doosan, to join the JV, mainly to financially support the project and share the 
financial risks. As a result, the shares owned by IE&C in the JV were accounted for only 
20% of the total equity, the smallest among all. Under such equity structure, IE&C 
“became wary about the disadvantages due to its weak position in equity shares.” In 
spite of the relatively high level of trust between Samsung and IE&C, trust in this JV 
was substantially weakened by the equity structure and the addition of a new partner.  
• High assessed level of needs for procurement autonomy 
This JV was responsible for the construction of 34 km viaducts. The contract was 
divided into three parts and separately assigned to and managed by each individual 
partner. For instance, Samsung independently built one prefabrication plant and 
procured all items and subcontractors for the assigned 13 km viaducts. In addition to the 
 36
Evergreen, the local partner. The equity share percentages for the two partners were 
42% and 58%, respectively. C291/C296 adopts JMJ. It is worth noting that Shimizu, the 
leading partner but with fewer equity shares, a common practice in construction JVs, 
confirms that the actual governance is not a strict or automatic consequence of 
ownership as argued by Geringer and Hebert (1989). 
• Low assessed level of cultural difference 
In terms of managerial decisions, all partners fully delegated their decision-making 
rights to their representing managers in the JV board. In terms of corporate values, both 
partners focused on the overall benefits of a JV and believed that an individual partner’s 
profit was dependent on the success of the JV. The only minor issue is that “the foreign 
partner’s exhibition of superiority during communication created some minor problems 
and uncomfortable atmosphere.”  
• High assessed level of trust 
Three major reasons contributed to the high level of trust between the partners in 
C291/C296, even though they had no previous cooperation experiences. First, Shimizu 
is a highly reputable major international construction firm. Second, Evergreen is one of 
THSR’s major shareholders. Third, some of the partners’ top managers were old time 
classmates and good friends. Since their bases of trust were very strong, we consider the 
level of trust to be high.  
• Moderate assessed level of needs for procurement autonomy 
In this JV, all decisions for procurement over $60,000 were made jointly and those 
below $60,000 were made independently. Despite the fact that the level of needs for 
procurement autonomy may seem low since most procurement decisions were jointly 
made, we considered the level of needs for autonomy to be moderate. The major reason 
 38
percentages for the three partners were 35%, 15%, and 50%, respectively.  This JV 
adopts JMJ. Note that the assessed levels of determinant variables in C295 were 
identical to those in C291/C296 JV, partly because Evergreen was the major shareholder 
in both JVs. Since the condition of each determinant variable in C295 is very similar to 
that in C291/C296, we shall forgo the details. Once again, the assessed levels of 
determinant variables in C295 strongly suggest the adoption of JMJ, as predicted by the 
proposed model. 
Overall Evaluation of the Model 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate empirically the proposed model by examining 
whether the JVs and their governance decisions in these cases replicate the logic 
underlying the model. Table 7 summarizes the results tabulated in Tables 3 to 6 and how 
the model is supported. In this case study, we’ve obtained six JV cases that demonstrate, 
in our opinion, very strong support for the model. As shown in Table 7, the six JVs are 
C210/C215, C230/C240, C260/C270, C280, C291/C296, and C295. We’ve also 
obtained one JV case, C220, that is marginally supportive and one, C250, that is neutral.  
As shown in Table 7, among the six JVs that strongly support the model, four adopted 
JMJ, as predicted by the model, one adopted SMJ also as predicted, and the other 
supports the model by the correlation between the JV’s early dissolution and the JV’s 
“inappropriate” governance choice. Furthermore, the JVs with marginal and neutral 
support, C220 and C250, respectively, though showing much weaker support, are by no 
means contradicting the proposed propositions. As shown in the column “Supportive or 
Not?” in Table 7, we conclude that the JVs in the THSR project reasonably support the 
proposed model for the choice of organizational control structure.
