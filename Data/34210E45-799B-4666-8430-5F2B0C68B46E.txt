ABSTRACT 
The solution, based on Neumann’s theory, for the content distribution of a diffusion material in a 
semi-infinite medium is applicable for the case in which a diffusion material diffuses from one side of a plate 
medium to the other side. After the diffusion material reaches the other side, the penetration rate of the 
diffusion material is solved using Fick’s diffusion law. In this study, concrete plates are manufactured and 
submerged individually in special containers with saltwater on one side and freshwater on the other side, and 
no electric charge is applied. The amount of chloride penetrating the plate is monitored. Data are used to 
derive the diffusivity and Neumann's constant, which are used to characterize penetration lag and rate. The 
value of Neumann’s constant is derived for the first time. This advancing model for a plate-shaped medium is 
also novel, and makes calculation of the penetration lag and diffusion depth possible. 
Keywords: chloride, concrete, diffusion, penetration lag 
 
Note: Since the conclusion of this project has been published as a journal paper which contents all the 
results of the research supported by the project, this report is the same as contents as those of the paper. 
 
I. INRODUCTION 
The penetration lag of chloride through a concrete plate is as important as the diffusivity of chloride 
diffusion in concrete. Penetration lag and diffusivity determine the service life of reinforced concrete 
structures in salty environments. Fick’s diffusion law [1] is conventionally applied to derive the chloride 
penetration rate through concrete plates [2]. Penetration is caused by natural diffusion, which is a prolonged 
process. Methods for rapid chloride diffusion applied an external electrical field. Rapid Chloride Permeability 
Test (RCPT) method (ASTM C1202-97 [3]) developed by Whiting [4] has been widely applied in recent 
years. However, McCarter et al. [5] reported that the measured conductivity is adversely affected by the raised 
temperature in RCPT. Many researchers improved the RCPT, such as Tang and Nilsson [6], Meck and 
Sirivivatnanon [7], and others [8–14]. Another technique, called Accelerated Chloride Migration Test (ACMT) 
was developed to improve the accuracy for the measurement of the chloride migration rate in steady state 
[15]. 
 The problem caused by the raised temperature in an accelerated test by an electrical charge has not been 
fully solved, and the effect of temperature on diffusion is material-dependent, which is not easy to 
characterize. Another significant problem is that the decomposition of concrete under an electrical charge, 
which totally changes the micro-structure of concrete. To prevent these problems, natural diffusion is applied 
in this study; natural diffusion is very time consuming but it is much closer to real-world situations than the 
accelerated ones. 
Based on Fick’s diffusion law, the chloride content in concrete induced by a salty environment is derived. 
The solution for content of a diffusing material encounters a serious problem for the case of a semi-infinite 
medium domain. The solution indicates that the content of a diffusion material cannot be zero, even at the 
deepest part of the medium and at the very beginning of diffusion. In reality, molecules of a diffusion material 
need time to travel from the surface contacting the diffusion material to a deep location in the medium. An 
advancing diffusion front tip indicating diffusion depth should exist. A no-zero solution for content of a 
diffusion material everywhere inside a medium at the start of the diffusion process does not make sense. The 
solution of diffusion material content in medium was modified by Carslaw and Jaeger based on Neumann’s 
algorithm for heat conduction [16]. The modified solution yields diffusion depth as a function of diffusion 
duration.

contacts the diffusion material still holds. 
When the diffusion material reaches the right surface of the plate-shaped medium, this case is no longer 
the same as a semi-infinite case. The limitation of plate thickness causes the content solution to differ from 
Eq.(3) [18]. Let the critical moment be the initial moment of the following step, which considers the right 
boundary. At this time, the content of the diffusion material is

where tc is the critical diffusion duration when the diffusion material reaches the right surface of the plate

penetrate the plate-shaped medium with thickness h. Characterization of the penetration lag according to 
advancing model is novel and is the major contribution of this study. Next, the diffusion material starts 
flowing into the free space on the right side of the plate medium. Based on Fick’s first diffusion law, flow rate

III. EXPERIMENT 
 In the study case, cylindrical concrete specimens 10cm in diameter are sliced into 2.0cm-thick, 
disk-shaped specimens. Type I cement is used. Mix design for the concrete and grain sizes of coarse aggregate 
and sand are shown in Tables 1, 2. The edge of each specimen is sealed with epoxy glue, rendering it 
waterproof. Half of the thickness on the left side of each specimen is squeezed into an angled PVC pipe with a 
10cm inner diameter, and the other half on the other side is squeezed into another angled PVC pipe to form a 
U-shaped fixture with the disk-shaped concrete specimen blocked at its center. The angled PVC pipe on the 
left side is filled with 1000c.c. of saltwater with 0.1g/cm3 chloride. The other pipe is filled with freshwater of 
same volume (Fig.3). The open tops of the fixture are covered with plastic sheets and sealed by rubber bands 
to prevent moisture vaporization. 
Chloride dissolved in water is the diffusion material, and water-logged concrete is the medium. This 
experiment is conducted in conditional chamber, in which the temperature is maintained at 251°C. The 
saltwater is replaced weekly to maintain the chloride content, and the water on the other side of the specimen
