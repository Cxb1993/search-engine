一、緒論 
1.1 背景與動機 
隨著知識經濟時代的來臨，知識與智慧資本已經成為現代生產最重要的條件，所以如
何妥善管理企業內部所蘊藏的無形資產智慧資本，被視為經營上最重要的課題之ㄧ【宋偉
航譯，1999】。透過智慧資本相關的研究發現，近幾年以來智慧資本逐漸受到各國內外學者
與業界之重視，但是過去以往有關智慧資本的實證研究，多著墨於知識密集型的產業如資
訊、高科技或傳統產業等。對營建業而言，智慧資本管理此一名詞則是近幾年才漸漸被受
到重視推行之企業經營概念，而且與營造業相關之研究甚少針對智慧資本的影響情形進行
討論，若有也是僅著重於營造業智慧資本發展之探討，尚未有研究投入於以營造業為研究
主題之實證調查。 
就營造產業來說，隨著產業結構與環境不確定性的增加，使綜合營造廠逐漸將專案執
行中部份的工程，分包給予專業營造廠，或是使其下包施作之比重上升【張倩瑜，2002】，
進一步探究營造業特性與其他產業特性迥然不同，營造業所生產的產品難以標準化，且組
織內最重要資產是以人力為主要關鍵，同時也為一個相當重個人經驗的產業。Kamara（2002）
提出營造業非常依賴個人所累積的內隱知識，但是因為組織內部員工流動率高，存在於員
工個人身上之專業知識與經驗亦隨之流失，因此若欲強化我國營造業競爭力之關鍵將在於
如何擷取內部員工的知識與經驗的創造生產、累積、移轉並加以運用轉換為公司內部資產，
在營造業整體運作過程中更顯現其存在的重要性。 
1.2 研究目的 
基於以上背景及動機，本研究以營建業產業中的營造業之智慧資本為研究主題，深入
探討其與企業績效間之關聯性。本文主要目的包含（1）暸解國內綜合營造廠智慧資本發展
概況，並進ㄧ步分析公司於管理保存既有的人力資本、結構資本與關係資本之情形；（2）
探討營造業組織內智慧資本對企業經營績效影響的程度，以瞭解智慧資本是否能為公司創
造較優異的經營績效之外，並衡量智慧資本三構面之關聯性。 
1.3 研究方法 
本研究透過問卷調查，暸解目前國內綜合營造廠智慧資本發展概況，並進一步進行相
關性分析瞭解智慧資本與企業經營績效之關聯性，最後再以徑路分析來驗證各個變項之間
是否具有因果之關聯性。

(4.91)」，較低者為「營運績效指標(4.81)」。 
智慧資本三構面中，表現較佳者為關係資本(5.52)，對於此現象本研究推論或許是因為
營造產業於執行工程業務過程中所涉及工程範圍較為廣泛，而且工程業務服務對象是以業
主為主，在確定簽約專案成立之後，必須依照業主事先訂定的設計規範執行採購與施工等
後續工作，亦因此使得國內工程界對公司外部關係之維持與建立較為重視。而其次人力資

ABSTRACT: Intellectual capital is one of the most valuable assets of any enterprise. This empirical 
investigation examines the causal relationship between intellectual capital and the performance of 
architecture firms. More than 100 architecture firms across Taiwan have each been assessed for the 
levels of human capital, structural capital, relational capital, and business performance. The results 
suggest that the architecture firms exhibit higher levels of relational capital. However, the firms 
indicate relatively low levels of human capital. Additionally, the results from the correlation analysis 
suggest that all the four measures (human capital, structural capital, relational capital, and business 
performance) are highly correlated. The findings from the path analysis also indicate that human 
capital may influence the performance of architecture firms via structural capital and relational 
capital. 
Keywords: human capital, structural capital, relational capital, architecture firm, business management 
1. INTRODUCTION 
With the advent of the knowledge economy, 
the focus of enterprises has gradually shifted 
from tangible assets to intellectual capital 
(Guthrie, 2001). The architecture firms, like 
firms in many other industries, use professional 
knowledge and emerging technologies to 
perform work efficiently. In the 
knowledge-intensive industry, one of the most 
valuable assets is intellectual capital, which is 
not shown in the balance sheet. Prior research 
suggested that the most important asset of an 
enterprise was production equipment in the 
twentieth century. However, the most valuable 
assets of a business were knowledge workers 
and their productivity in the twenty-first century. 
Previous research has also shown that business 
performance may be associated with intangible 
resources and capabilities. Since knowledge has 
become the most important element of modern 
production, it is important to understand how to 
properly manage the intellectual capital of a 
company (Stewart, 1999). Even though earlier 
studies have identified benefits of intellectual 
capital, however, no comprehensive study has 
been done on the levels of intellectual capital in 
architecture firms. In addition, there has been no 
2) experimentation, 3) systemic integration, and 
4) collaboration. Despite the fact that employees 
are the most important assets of an enterprise, 
Edvinsson and Malone (1997) noted that the 
company cannot own human capital. The 
enterprise owners should be aware of the 
principle of resource-sharing. By properly 
utilizing the knowledge, skill, and capability of 
employees, a firm can create and sustain a 
competitive advantage. In summary, the prior 
research suggested that enterprises must not 
only teach the employees how to foster their 
professional skill through analytical thinking, 
but also tell them the reason why this is 
important. Additionally, an effective way to 
increase intellectual capital is to appropriately 
invest in employees (Stewart, 1999). 
Structural capital is defined as the sum of the 
strategy, structure, systems, and processes that 
enable an organization to produce and deliver a 
product to customers (Grantham and Nichols, 
1997). It includes the physical systems used to 
transmit and store intellectual material. 
Additionally, it provides the environment to 
create and share knowledge effectively, shorten 
learning time, and improve the productivity of 
human capital. The structural capital of a firm 
consists of four elements: system, structure, 
strategy, and culture (Hubert, 1996). With the 
help of tools such as technology, manufacturing 
descriptions, operations manuals, and Internet, 
structural capital can improve the productivity 
of human capital and help transform human 
capital into wealth for a firm (Stewart, 1999; 
Hubert, 1996).  
The relational capital refers to the 
relationships between enterprises, customers, 
suppliers and partners (Johnson, 1999), which is 
a key to long-lasting economic profit and an 
essential element for operating a successful 
business. Major considerations include 
customer satisfaction, purchase frequency, 
characteristics of customers, price and quantity 
of transaction, product quality, and service. In 
the information-explosion era, it is easy for 
customers to find suppliers, which changes the 
balance between buyers and sellers. In such an 
environment the key to creating profit is to win 
customer's trust and loyalty and build long-term 
relationships with them.  
The literature review provides background 
for developing an understanding of the issues 
related to the use of intellectual capital and the 
benefits to be derived from intellectual capital. 
Researchers in a number of disciplines outside 
of architecture have suggested that intellectual 
capital is becoming increasingly critical to 
business success. However, the literature on 
architecture has largely ignored the impact of 
intellectual capital on business performance. No 
industry-wide study has been done on the levels 
of intellectual capital in architecture firms. In 
addition, there has been no comprehensive 
industry-wide study on the impacts of 
intellectual capital at various levels on the 
performance of architecture firms. Since little 
research has explored intellectual capital in the 
architecture, engineering, and construction 
(A/E/C) industry, this research adds to the 
literature in two valuable ways. First, it provides 
important results on the uses of intellectual 
capital at various levels. Second, it provides 
evidence of performance implications of 
intellectual capital in the A/E/C industry.

This research employed a mail survey 
methodology for data collection. The sample for 
this study focuses on architecture firms in the 
Taiwanese A/E/C industry. The sample was 
selected from the National Association of 
Architect, Taiwan. To ensure that respondents 
are more likely to answer honestly, the survey is 
anonymous. The survey questionnaire was sent 
to 714 senior practitioners. Of the 
questionnaires sent, 114 were returned. The 
overall response rate was 15.97 percent. Among 
the returned surveys, 7 were discarded since 
they contained too many missing values. 
Ultimately, 107 survey responses were used in 
the analysis. With respect to years in business, 
43.0 percent of the companies are less than 10, 
38.3 percent are between 10 and 20, and the 
remaining 18.7 percent are more than 20. These 
firms averaged 14.3 years in business.  
3.3 Analytical Methods 
The analysis was divided into three steps. 
Step 1 consisted of developing descriptive 
statistics.  Included in the descriptive statistics 
are the means and standard deviations of the 
computed indices. The purpose of generating 
the descriptive statistics was to determine the 
levels of intellectual capital in use.  Step 2 
entailed investigating the correlations among 
the three dimensions of intellectual capital and 
business performance. Additionally, Cronbach’s 
coefficient (α) was calculated to test the 
reliability and internal consistency of the 
responses. Step 3 involved identifying the 
cause-effect relationship between the three 
dimensions of intellectual capital and business 
performance. Path analysis was employed to 
verify the theoretical model. Furthermore, the 
correlation analysis was also used to check 
linear relationship between the variables, which 
constituted the basic assumptions of path 
analysis (Brown et al., 2007). 
4. RESEARCH FINDINGS 
4.1 Levels of Intellectual Capital and 
Business Performance 
results of the correlation analysis for the main 
dimensions are presented in Table 3. There are 
positive correlations between the three 
dimensions of intellectual capital and business 
performance. The empirical results indicate that 
human capital exhibits the highest correlation 
coefficient with business performance. On the 
other hand, there are also positive correlations 
among the three dimensions of intellectual 
capital; moreover, all coefficients exceed 0.5. 
The correlation between human capital and 
structural capital is relatively high. The results 
from the analysis suggest that all the four 
measures (human capital, structural capital, 
relational capital, and business performance) are 
highly correlated. Furthermore, using 
Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, reliability was 
assessed for human capital at 0.894, structural 
capital at 0.881, relational capital at 0.879, and 
business performance at 0.906, which indicate a 
high degree of internal consistency in the 
responses. The results of the correlation analysis 
for the sub-dimensions are presented in Table 4. 
There are positive correlations among most of 
the sub-dimensions. Among the sub-dimensions, 
there appears to be stronger positive 
correlations between the following pairs of 
variables: 1) “knowledge exchange among 
staff” and “information system framework”, 2) 
“knowledge exchange among staff” and 
“overall business process”, 3) “overall business 
process” and “information system framework”, 
and 4) “financial performance” and “operations 
performance.”  
 
4.3 Path Analysis  
Path analysis was conducted to identify a 
causal pattern of the variables in the theoretical 
model. The analysis is an extension of the 
regression model. In this study, it consists of 
two parts. In the first part, the causal effects of 
intellectual capital on business performance 
were estimated. In the second part, the 
interactions among human capital, structural 
capital and relational capital were determined.  
 
First part: 
BP = β1 SC +β2 HC +β3 RC + ε          
 (1)                            
Second part:  
SC = β1 HC + ε                      (2) 
RC = β1 HC + ε                     (3) 
 
where: 
BP = business performance; 
SC = structural capital; 
HC = human capital; 
RC = relational capital; and 
ε is the error term. 
 
 
 Path coefficients for the model of are reported on the path diagram shown in Figure 
2. The results indicate that business performance increases by 0.357 standard units for 
each 1 standard unit increase in structural capital, which suggests that higher levels of 
structural capital may contribute to the success of architecture firms. These analyses 
also reveal that increased levels of relational capital are associated with improvement 
in the performance of architecture firms. As previous research highlighted the role of 
human capital in the development of intellectual capital (Roos and Krogh, 1997; 
Stewart, 1999; Grantham and Nichols, 1997), the remaining causal paths suggest that 
increases in human capital tend to improve the degrees of structural capital and 
relational capital for architecture firms. In addition to the aforementioned cause-effect 
relationship, the findings also indicate that human capital may influence the 
performance of architecture firms via structural capital and relational capital. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
The primary purpose of this study was to examine the causal relationship between 
intellectual capital and business performance. The second objective in this research 
was to investigate the extent to which intellectual capital are being used in 
architecture firms. These were accomplished by an industry-wide survey and analysis 
of 107 architecture firms. Descriptive statistics were developed to determine levels of 
human capital, structural capital, relational capital, and business performance. This 
research also determines the correlations among the three dimensions of intellectual 
capital (i.e., human capital, structural capital and relational capital) and business 
performance. Additionally, path analysis was conducted to identify a causal pattern of 
the variables in the theoretical model.

structural capital Æ business performance, and 6) human capitalÆrelational capitalÆ 
business performance. The results also suggest that human capital may influence the 
performance of architecture firms via structural capital and relational capital.  
In summary, as prior research highlighted the role of human capital in the 
development of intellectual capital, the causal paths suggest that increases in human 
capital tend to improve the degrees of structural capital and relational capital for 
architecture firms. The results of the analyses are consistent with previous theories, 
which suggest that an effective way to increase intellectual capital is to appropriately 
invest in employees. Thus, consideration should be given to human resource 
management such as staff education and training, staff capability, and knowledge 
exchange among staff. This research provides empirical evidence that supports the 
expectation of gaining significant benefits with higher levels of intellectual capital. 
The results of this study indicate that intellectual capital is critical to the performance 
of architecture firms. Findings from this study provide direction for the decision 
making of investment in intellectual capital.
