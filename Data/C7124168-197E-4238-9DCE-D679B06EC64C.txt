extremely small force of several nano-Newton and provided as an excellent energy 
dissipation mechanism. With the recent advance of nanotechnology, there is a 
growing interest in studying how mechanical properties of the nanostructured 
materials differ from their bulk counterparts.  
Various fabrication methods have been proposed to synthesize nanosprings so as 
to investigate their growth mechanisms. Amelinckx et al.8 prepared the helix-shaped 
carbon nanotube by depositing organic vapors on metallic catalyst at the high 
temperature and introduced the concept of a spatial-velocity hodograph to describe the 
helical growth from the growth velocity variations in the perimeter of the nanotube. 
Gao et al.6 employed the vapor-solid growth process to spontaneously form the 
superlattice-structured zinc oxide nanohelix with two types of alternating and 
periodically distributed long crystal stripes, which were oriented with their c axes 
perpendicular to each other. Wang7 employed a solid-vapor phase thermal sublimation 
technique to synthesize single-crystalline zinc oxide helical nanowire under specific 
growth conditions. McIlroy et al.9 grew boron carbide nanosprings on a silicon 
substrate using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique and 
proposed that the contact angle anisotropy at the catalyst/wire interface is the 
mechanism to drive helical growth. He et al.10 used a multilayer glancing-angle 
deposition technique to fabricate Si/Ni heterogeneous nanospring with alternating 
layers of amorphous silicon and faced-center-cubic nickel nanorods. Bell et al.11 
adopted a conventional microfabrication techniques to create a planar pattern in a 
SiGe/Si bilayer, which then self-assembles into three-dimensional nanospring 
structures during a wet etch release. 
Despite the initial successful growth of the helical or coiled structures, the 
consistent fabrication control of the nanosprings is still a subject of great research

II. MOLECULAR SIMULATION 
The suitable interatomic potentials and atomic model are essential to carry out a 
proper molecular simulation. Without loss of generality, faced-center-cubic (fcc) 
copper is chosen for this study with lattice constant 3.615Å. Embedded-atom-method 
(EAM) potential developed by Foiles, Baskes, and Daw15 is chosen to describe atomic 
interactions. Among the various types of n-body potentials, the EAM potential is one 
of the most realistic and promising potentials, which provide a relevant description of 
the surface effect and defect properties of the transition metals with either an fcc or 
bcc structure.16 In EAM potential, the total energy is composed of the electrostatic 
pairwise interaction energy between atoms and the embedding energy required to 
insert the atom into the local electron density field created by its near neighbors. 
Empirical functions in EAM potential are fitted to experimentally measured bulk 
material properties, such as equilibrium lattice constants, sublimation energies, elastic 
constants, and vacancy formation energy.  
 Atomic model of nanospring is constructed by firstly creating a large block of fcc 
single-crystalline copper atoms and keeping the atoms that are within the wire 
diameter, t, along the nanospring centerline as shown in Fig. 1. The spatial relation of 
the nanospring centerline can be described by

where R, P are the radius and pitch of nanospring helix, respectively. ( xeˆ , yeˆ , zeˆ ) is a 
fixed Cartesian basis. The vertical displacement will shift a pitch when θ rotates an 
angle of 2π and, thus, the spring rising angle α is defined as 
R
P
πα 2tan = . In most 
models, only one full pitch length of the nanospring is considered. The periodic 
 - 8 -  
radii, R, of the nanosprings are in the range of 2~6 nm, the wire diameters, t, are 
1.5~5nm and the pitches are 10~35nm as listed in Table 1. The numbers of atoms in 
the simulation model are 2397~85573, respectively. Meanwhile, three different 
arrangements of nanospring crystallographic orientations are constructed as shown in 
Fig. 2 to illustrate the crystal orientation dependence.

equilibrate within the changed dimensions and current minimum energy positions are 
computed. Following each loading step, the system energies of the nanospring are 
recorded as in Fig. 3. It is found that the system energies increase as the tensile or 
compressive loadings increase and the energy-loading curve is parabola. Using the 
parabolic equation, 2

radius and pitch sizes (S, St series), the nanospring behaves stiffer compared to the 
larger ones (L, Lt series). As the radii of nanosprings increase, the stiffness of the 
nanosprings becomes smaller as shown in Fig. 5(b). For smaller pitch and wire 
diameter sizes (S, SR series), the nanosprings become softer compared to the larger 
ones (L, LR series). Moreover, the nanospings become less stiff when the pitches 
increase except for the [111] nanospring model with larger radii and wire diameters (L, 
LP series) and the stiffness deviations between [100], [110] and [111] nanosprings are 
significant for small models (S, SP series) as depicted in Fig. 5(c).

IV. DISCUSSION 
In this research, the geometric size and crystal orientation effects on elastic 
behaviors of nanosprings are systematically studied using molecular statics method. 
Without consideration of velocity term, the computation time for molecular statics 
method is relatively shorter as compared to other molecular methods. However, 
molecular statics simulation is limited to zero K temperature also due to its lack of 
velocity term and the loading process is considered quasi-static unlike the high 
loading rate in molecular dynamics simulation. As illustrated by Chang et al.17, 
molecular statics method could adequately calculate the elastic properties of 
nanomaterials as the molecular dynamics simulation at low temperature and the trend 
of size dependence of elastic behavior would not be altered by temperature.  
The dependences of nanospring stiffness on the geometric parameters (radius, 
wire diameter and pitch) are further analyzed according to the derived expression by 
Da Fonseca et al.14 based on continuum Kirchhoff rod model

where E is Young’s modulus of the nanospring material and N is the number of turns. 
Indeed, a linear relationship is observed between the elastic constants and the fourth 
order of the simulated wire diameters as well as the inverse of the third order of radii 
irrespective to the crystal orientations as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). Also the 
nanospring stiffness is linearly proportional to the inverse of number of turns from the 
simulation results as illustrated in Fig. 7(d), which is similar to the equivalent stiffness 
of the bulk springs in serial connection. However, there is no trivial relationship 
observed between the stiffness and the nanospring rising angle or pitch especially for

Molecular statics method incorporating minimum energy concept was employed to study the
one-dimensional copper nanospring with faced-center-cubic crystal structure. Various geometric
sizes wire diameter, radius, pitch, numbers of turns and crystal orientations of nanosprings were
systematically modeled to investigate the size dependence of elastic properties. It was observed that
as the wire diameter increases and the radius and number of turns decrease, the nanospring stiffness
would increase irrespective of the crystal orientations. Moreover, the elastic constants of
nanosprings would become larger while the pitches become smaller for almost all the crystal
orientations. Also the simulation results were compared to the predictions based on continuum

I. INTRODUCTION
Nanotechnology is now considered one of the most
prominent areas to be explored in the 21st century. The de-
velopment of one-dimensional nanostructures such as nano-
tubes and nanowires has attracted a lot of attention from
different scientific communities due to their possible appli-
cations and unique physical phenomena. For example, InP
and ZnO nanowires and carbon nanotubes are fabricated as
light emitting devices and implemented in light emitting di-
odes and laser.1–3 Silicon nanowires are developed as high
frequency resonators and utilized as nanosensors for the de-
tection of biological and chemical species.4 Among them,
helical nanowires and coiled nanotubes referred hereafter
generally as nanosprings are innovative forms of one-
dimensional nanostructures that have promising applications
in nanoelectromechanical systems.5–7 Nanosprings could be
employed to measure an extremely small force of several
nanonewtons and provided as an excellent energy dissipation
mechanism. With the recent advance in nanotechnology,
there is a growing interest in studying how the mechanical
properties of the nanostructured materials differ from those
of their bulk counterparts.
Various fabrication methods have been proposed to syn-
thesize nanosprings so as to investigate their growth mecha-
nisms. Amelinckx et al.8 prepared a helix-shaped carbon
nanotube by depositing organic vapors on a metallic catalyst
at a high temperature and introduced the concept of a spatial-
velocity hodograph to describe the helical growth from the
growth velocity variations in the perimeter of the nanotube.
Gao et al.6 employed the vapor-solid growth process to spon-
taneously form a superlattice-structured zinc oxide nanohelix
with two types of alternating and periodically distributed
long crystal stripes, which were oriented with their c axes
perpendicular to each other. Wang7 employed a solid-vapor
phase thermal sublimation technique to synthesize a single-
crystalline zinc oxide helical nanowire under specific growth
conditions. McIlroy et al.9 grew boron carbide nanosprings
on a silicon substrate using the plasma enhanced chemical
vapor deposition technique and proposed that the contact
angle anisotropy at the catalyst/wire interface is the mecha-
nism to drive helical growth. He et al.10 used a multilayer
glancing-angle deposition technique to fabricate a Si /Ni het-
erogeneous nanospring with alternating layers of amorphous
silicon and faced-center-cubic fcc nickel nanorods. Bell et
al.11 adopted a conventional microfabrication technique to
create a planar pattern in a SiGe /Si bilayer, which then self-
assembles into three-dimensional nanospring structures dur-
ing a wet etch release.
Despite the initial successful growth of the helical or
coiled structures, the consistent fabrication control of the
nanosprings is still a subject of great research interest to
many researchers. Meanwhile, there are some experimental
attempts to study the physical and mechanical properties of
these nanospring structures. Scanning transmission micros-
copy, atomic force microscopy AFM, and transmission
electron microscopy have been widely used to characterize
the properties of nanostructures. Volodin et al.12 studied the
elastic properties of coiled multiwalled nanotubes using
AFM combined with a circular beam approximation and ob-
served that the Young’s modulus remains comparable to the
hexagonal graphene sheets, which agree with the classical
theory of elasticity. Singh et al.5 compressed the cobalt
coated silicon nanospring by passing through a dc using a
conductive AFM tip and found that the spring constant de-
termined from the measurements was consistent with that
obtained from a finite element analysis. Chen et al.13 loaded
a carbon nanocoil with two AFM tips and observed that the
nanocoil behaves like an elastic spring in the low-strain re-
gime with an elastic constant upturn in the high-strain re-
gime. In addition to experimental characterization of the
nanospring elastic properties, some researchers adopted con-
tinuum approaches to derive expressions for the nanospring
stiffness.14 However, it is still an unsettled question whether
classical theory could apply to predict the behaviors of nano-
structures and to what extent it can apply at the nanoscale.

spring, K, could be calculated. The spring constant is deter-
mined from the parabolic curve best fit to the displacement-
energy curve.
III. RESULTS
Molecular statics approach is utilized to simulate the
uniaxial tensile and compressive test of copper nanosprings.
The size and crystal orientation effects on elastic behaviors
are studied and the elastic constants calculated from the
energy-loading relation are systematically compared. The
atomic structures of nanosprings at the equilibrium are ex-
amined and it is found that the initial shapes are preserved as
plotted in Fig. 4a. Moreover, it is noticed that the equili-
brated nanosprings still maintain the crystalline fcc structure
from the radial distribution function RDF as depicted in
Fig. 4b.
As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the elastic constants of the
nanosprings increase as the wire diameters become larger
irrespective of the crystal orientations. For smaller radius and
pitch sizes S, St series, the nanospring behaves stiffer com-
pared to the larger ones L, Lt series. As the radii of the
nanosprings increase, the stiffness of the nanosprings be-
comes smaller as shown in Fig. 5b. For smaller pitch and
wire diameter sizes S, SR series, the nanosprings become

master line, which suggests that the classic equation predicts
well the relationship between the stiffness and the nano-
spring radius and wire diameter combining with the number
of turns as K t4 /NR3 but not with the rising angle or pitch.
The reason why the rising angle or pitch would affect the
elastic behaviors of nanosprings in a different way described
by the classical theory is not clear and further research is
needed. This also implies that some modifications need to be
made to the classical equations in order to apply in the stiff-
ness prediction of nanosprings.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this work, molecular statics method with EAM poten-
tial is employed to study single-crystalline copper nano-
springs. Several geometric sizes, numbers of turns, and crys-
tal orientations of nanosprings are systematically simulated
in order to investigate the stiffness dependence. It is shown
consistently that the elastic constants of nanosprings are ob-
served to increase as the wire diameter increases, while the
radius and number of turns decrease irrespective of the crys-
tal orientation of the nanospring. Moreover, the elastic con-
stants of the nanosprings would become larger while the

(2001), McIlroy, Alkhateeb, Zhang, Aston, Marcy, and Norton (2004), He, Fu,
Zhang, Zhao, Zhang, Xia, and Cai (2007), Bell, Sun, Zhang, Dong, Nelson, and
Grutzmacher (2006)]. It is observed that the cross-sectional shape of nanosprings
varies from circle, ellipse to rectangle [McIlroy, Zhang, Kranov, Norton (2001),
McIlroy, Alkhateeb, Zhang, Aston, Marcy, Norton (2004), Wang (2004)] possibly
due to the differences in stress and strain during formation. Despite the initial suc-
cessful growth of the helical or coiled structures, the consistent fabrication control
of the nanosprings is still a subject of great research interest to many researchers.
There are several experimental attempts to characterize the physical and mechanical
properties of these nanospring structures using scanning transmission microscopy
(STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Volodin, Ahlskog, Seynaeve, Van Haesendonck, Fonseca, and Nagy (2003)
studied the elastic properties of coiled multiwalled nanotubes using AFM combined
with a circular beam approximation and observed that the Young’s modulus re-
mains comparable to the hexagonal graphene sheets, which agree with the classical
theory of elasticity. Chen, Zhang, Dikin, Ding, Ruoff, Pan, and Nakayama (2003)
loaded a carbon nanocoil with two AFM tips and observed that the nanocoil be-
haves like an elastic spring in the low-strain regime with an elastic constant upturn
in the high-strain regime. Singh, Liu, Ye, Picu, Lu, and Wang (2004) compressed
the cobalt coated silicon nanospring by passing through a dc using a conductive
AFM tip and found that the spring constant determined from the measurements
was consistent with that obtained from a finite element analysis.
In addition to experimental characterization of the nanospring elastic properties,
some researchers adopted continuum approaches to derive expressions for the nano-
spring stiffness [Da Fonseca, Malta, and Galvao (2006a)(2006b)]. However, it is
still an unsettled question whether classical theory could apply to predict the behav-
iors of nanostructures and to what extent it can apply at the nanoscale. Molecular
simulation method is a proper and frequently used tool to study the mechanical
properties of nanostructures [Chen, Cheng, and Hsu (2007), Nair, Farkas, and Kriz
(2008), Nishidate, and Nikishkov (2008)]. Chang and Yeh (2008) studied the elas-
tic properties of circular cross-sectional nanospring using molecular statics method
and found that some modifications need to be made to the classical equations in
order to apply in the stiffness prediction of nanosprings.
In this research, we will focus on the atomistic study of elliptic cross-sectional
nanospring. A series of systematic simulations will be performed to study the ge-
ometric size, cross-sectional shape and crystal orientation effect on the stiffness of
the nanospring based on molecular statics calculation.

Molecular statics simulations are implemented using the conjugate gradient method
to carry out the energy minimization process so that the equilibrium atomic struc-
ture could be obtained. The considered energy includes the potential energy of
interatomic interactions and potential energy due to external loading. Because the
initial atomic positions of the nanospring might not be in their equilibrium condi-
tion, the model is fully relaxed by adjusting the periodic length in the z direction
to eliminate the nonzero initial stresses. Since there is no constraint applied in the

are preserved as plotted in Fig. 5(a). Moreover, it is noticed that the equilibrated
nanosprings still maintain the crystalline fcc structure from the radial distribution
function (RDF) as depicted in Fig. 5(b).
As illustrated in Fig. 6(a), the spring constants of both normal and binormal
nanosprings increase as the wire semi-axis length become larger irrespective to the
crystal orientations. It is noted that the stiffness increases more drastically as the
semi-axis a increases for normal nanosprings (N, Nt series) than the semi-axis b for
binormal ones (B, Bt series). As the radii and pitches of the nanosprings increase,
the stiffness of the nanosprings becomes smaller as shown in Fig. 6(b) and 6(c).
It is observed that [100] nanosprings are stiffer than both [110] and [111] ones for
both normal and binormal nanosprings. Moreover, the normal nanosprings (N, Nt,
NR, NP series) always behave stiffer than the binormal ones (B, Bt, BR, BP series)
for the same radius, pitch and cross-sectional geometry in the comparison.

loading process is considered quasi-static unlike the high loading rate in molecular
dynamics simulation. As discussed by Chang and Chen (2007), molecular stat-
ics method could adequately calculate the elastic properties of nanomaterials as the
molecular dynamics simulation at low temperature and the trend in size dependence
of elastic behavior would not be altered by temperature.
The dependences of nanospring stiffness on the geometric parameters (radius, wire
semi-axis length and pitch) are further analyzed based on the derived expression
by Da Fonseca, Malta, and Galvao (2006a,b) using the continuum Kirchhoff rod
model

where E is Young’s modulus of the nanospring material and N is the number of
turns. Indeed, a linear relationship is observed between the elastic constants and
the simulated wire semi-axis length (a3b), the inverse of the third order of radii
as well as the cosine of the rising angle irrespective to the crystal orientations as
shown in Fig. 7(a), (b) and (c). It is noticed that [100] nanosprings are always
stiffer than both [110] and [111] ones for the same geometric size no matter normal
or binormal nanosprings.
Besides, it is found that the simulation results collapse into individual master lines
for respective crystal orientations and cross-sectional shape (normal and binormal)
as illustrated in Fig. 8, which suggests that the classic equation predicts well the
relationship between the stiffness and the nanospring radius and wire semi-axis
length combining with the rising angle as K ∝ a3bR3 cosα for elliptic cross-sectional
nanosprings. However, the slopes of individual master curve are different, which
indicates that the Young’s modulus is not the same for different crystal orientation.
This can be realized by the amorphous material assumption made by Da Fonseca,
Malta, and Galvao (2006b) in their derivation while the single crystalline copper
nanosprings investigated in our research are not made of isotropic materials.
5 Concluding remarks
In this work, molecular statics method with EAM potential is employed to study
single-crystalline copper nanosprings with elliptical cross sections. Several geo-
metric sizes, cross-sectional shape (normal and binormal) and crystal orientations
of nanosprings are systematically simulated in order to investigate the elastic con-
stant dependence. It is shown consistently that the elastic constants of nanosprings
are observed to increase as the semi-axis length increases, while the radius and
pitch decrease irrespective to the crystal orientation of the nanospring. It is shown
that two nanosprings of the same cross-sectional geometry, radius and pitch but

differing by the fact that one is a normal structure and the other is binormal, have
different stiffness. In our study, the normal nanospring is always stiffer than the bi-
normal one. Furthermore, it is concluded that the classical equations derived based
on continuum theory could predict the elastic behavior of elliptic cross-sectional
nanospring quite well.
