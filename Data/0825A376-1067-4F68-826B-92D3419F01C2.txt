Abstract 
 This study presents a modified 
molecular structure mechanics (MSM) model 
for determining the mechanical properties of 
carbon nanotubes, especially in the radial 
direction. In the proposed model, the 
interactions between two carbon atoms is 
modeled with the second generation force 
field using continuum pseudo-rectangular 
beam elements while the non-bonded van der 
Waals (vdW) atomistic interactions among 
atoms are simulated with the Lennard-Jones 
(L-J) potential using spring elements. The 
beam consists of a different bending rigidity 
in the two principal centroidal axes of the 
cross section, and the stiffness parameters of 
which are estimated based on the bond-angle 
variation energy and the weak inversion 
energy in molecular mechanics. By the 
approach, the mechanical properties of 
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), 
including radial modulus, radial buckling 
load, radial deformation, Young’s modulus, 
and Poisson’s ratio are calculated. To 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified 
MSM model, the derived results are 
compared with those of the MSM model and 
the published theoretical and experimental 
data.  
Results show that the radial modulus of 
the zigzag type of the SWCNTs with a radius 
of 0.63~ 2.35 nm is about 19.3~0.58 GPa 
through the modified MSM model, and that 
of the armchair one with a radius of 
0.61~2.38 nm is about 15.7~0.36 GPa. The 
results are considerably less than those of the 
conventional MSM model, and most 
importantly, much more consistent with the 
literature data. In addition, even the weak 
in-layer vdW interactions may result in 
 4
W
equivalent continuum beam elements. The 
stiffness values of the beam, namely the 
bond-stretching, bond-angle-variation and 
torsional-resistance force constants, are 
constructed by relating the strength of the 
continuum beam to the interactions between 
atoms or the bond potential energy, including 
the bond-stretching energy, the bond-angle 
variation energy and the dihedral-angle 
torsion energy. In the model, the cross 
section of the beam was assumed to be round, 
implying that there is an equivalent sectional 
bending rigidity in any radial direction. The 
bending stiffness parameter (i.e., the 
bond-angle-variation force constant) of the 
round beam is determined simply based on 
the bond-angle variation energy. However, 
according to the potential energy of a 
covalent bond in molecular mechanics, the 
beam bending rigidity should be dependent 
on both the bond-angle variation energy and 
the inversion energy, as shown in Fig. 1. 
Since the inversion energy is considered 
trivial (e.g., Cornell et. al., 1995; and Chang 
and Gao, 2003), as compared to the 
bond-angle variation energy, the former 
maily determines the bending stiffness of the 
covalent bond in the major principal 
centroidal axis of the section while the latter 
determines that in the minor one. It should be 
noted that the minor-axis bending stiffness 
may greatly affect the radial mechanical 
properties of CNTs. Unfortunately, the effect 
was not considered in the MSM model, thus 
may resulting in an overestimate of the 
mechanical properties of SWCNTs, 
especially in the radial direction. For 
example, the difference in the calculated 
radial modulus of the MSM model (Li and 
Chou, 2004c) from the MD simulation 
(Wang et al., 2007) is on the order of about 
one to two orders of magnitude. Although 
Kasti (2007) proposed a modification of the 
bond bending stiffness for the MSM model, 
the modified expression is valid only for a 
zigzag type CNT, and in addition, its 
derivation is highly complex.  
In this study, we present a new ECM 
approach based on the modification of the 
MSM model, termed the modified MSM 
model, to characterize the mechanical 
properties of SWCNTs, especially in the 
radial direction. As discussed in the paper, 
the proposed model turns out to be very 
effective in characterizing the radial 
mechanical properties of SWCNTs.  
 
2. Theoretical Modeling 
2.1 The MSM Model 
The original MSM model was 
developed by Li and Chou (2003a, b), where 
an equivalent round beam and a nonlinear 
rod element were adopted to simulate 
bonding forces and vdW interactions 
between two atoms, respectively. The 
procedure for deriving the MSM model is 
briefly shown as follows. 
The general expression of the potential 
energy  for a covalent bond system was 
presented by Cornell et al. (1995),  
tV
t r v dV = V + V + V V + Vθ φ ω+∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ,  (2-1) 
where , rV Vθ , Vφ , Vω , and  are the 
bond-stretching energy, the bond-angle 
variation energy, the dihedral-angle torsion 
energy, the inversion energy, and the vdW 
interaction energy, respectively. Figure 1 
schematically represents the potential energy 
in molecular mechanics. 
v d WV
The electrostatic interaction is neglected 
because CNTs are neutral. In addition, many 
previous studies (e.g., Cornell et. al., 1995; 
and Chang and Gao, 2003) claimed that the 
inversion energy is quite trivial, as compared 
to the other energy terms, and is thus 
neglected in the MSM model. It will be 
however proved in this paper that the energy 
term is indeed negligible to the axial 
mechanical properties of CNTs but not to the 
radial ones mainly also because of its 
insignificance.  
In summary, for a covalent bond 
structure, such as a CNT, the total potential 
energy is basically dominated by the first 
three terms of Eq. (2-1). Based on the 
harmonic expressions under the assumption 
of small deformation, the simple expressions 
for these energy terms can be written as 
 ( ) ( )2 201 12 2= − = Δr r rV K r r K r , (2-2) 
 ( ) ( )2 201 12 2θ θ θθ θ θ= − = ΔV K K , (2-3)

Assume that another single force Fz parallel 
to the Z axis is applied at the point O, thus 
inducing a moment My directed along the Y 
axis. The force would bring about the 
inversion energy Vω  between the atom O 
and the plane A-B-C, as shown in Fig. 3(b). 
Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the 
inversion energy is equivalent to the bending 
energy of OA

where Kω  is inversion force constant from 
Cornell et al. (1995); R is relatively small 
under the assumption of small deformation, 
i.e. yR L θ≈ ⋅ , where yθ  is the bending 
angle of the beam OA with respect to Y. The 
following relation can be obtained similar to 
Eq. (2-6)

Clearly, the Iy is far smaller than Iz, 
indicating that the assumption of the round 
beam in the MSM would result in an 
overestimation in the radial stiffness of 
SWCNTs. The above derivation is only valid 
for a graphite sheet. The derivation for the 
SWCNTs is illustrated in the follows. 
Two hexagons in a zigzag CNT are 
shown in Fig. (3c). The angle between Y and 
plane O-A-D-B is defined as φ, which 
approaches to zero as the radius of SWCNT 
increases to infinite, i.e. for graphite sheet. 
Consider a force Fx acting at B parallel to X, 
which contributes to a moment M, which is 
not parallel to Z. Therefore, the bond-angle 
variation energy between OA and OB is not 
exactly equal to the bending energy of OA in 
Z direction, i.e. the Eq. (2-9) does not hold. 
To obtain a more suitable relation, the 
moment M should be separated into My and 
Mz parallel to Y and Z, i.e. 
sinyM M ϕ= , (2-14a) 
coszM M ϕ= . (2-14b) 
According to Eq. (2-6), the corresponding

moments are

Since the bond-angle variation energy Vθ , E, 
L are constants, the Eq. (2-16) can be written 
as

Substitute Eq. (2-15) in Eq. (2-18), and 
assume the moment of inertia is proportional

written as

Moreover, from Eq. (2-13), the bending 
energy from inversion energy should be also 
considered, i.e. 
1 2( )y zI k k I= + ⋅ . (2-20)
As the angle φ increase, k2 approaches zero, 
which is consistent with the case of a 
graphite sheet in Eq. (2-13). From the above 
equations, the modified moment of inertia Iy 
and Iz can be calculated. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
To verify the accuracy of the modified 
MSM, the radial mechanical properties, such 
as radial modulus, radial buckling behavior 
and radial deformation, are calculated and 
compared with the results of various other 
studies. The influence of the modification on 
Poisson’s ratio and axial Young’s modulus is 
2007)). Accordingly, the results show that 
the modification in the modified MSM 
primarily degrades the stiffness of SWCNTs 
in the radial direction, and has a relatively 
small effect on the axial Young’s modulus of 
the SWCNTs. 
 
3.3 Radial Buckling Behavior and 
Deformation of SWCNTs 
Radial buckling and radial deformation of 
the SWCNTs are also of great importance 
and are associated with the radial stiffness of 
the SWCNTs. The radial buckling refers to 
the collapse of a tube in radial direction due 
to its instability. As shown in Fig. 8, the 
in-layer vdW interaction may result in radial 
deformation of the SWCNTs. The radial 
buckling would occur as the radius of the 
SWCNTs increases to a certain value since 
its stiffness becomes weaker. In this study, 
the critical buckling load Pcr of the SWCNTs 
in radial direction can be derived from 
elastic-instability analysis (Chen and Lui, 
1987) based on the following equation for 
elastic instability, 
0][ 10 =+ ψKλK , (3-4) 
where ψ  is the buckling-mode shape 
(eigenvector),  is the linear stiffness 
matrix, and 
0K
1K  denotes the geometric 
stiffness matrix. The factor  at which 
buckling occurs is designated “
λ
crλ ”, and 
. The summation of initial vdW 
interaction on every atom is chosen to be the 
unit load P, and the eigenvalue 
PλP crcr =
crλ  can be 
obtained by finite element calculation. The 
approach of the eigenvalue crλ  to unity 
indicates that the corresponding vdW 
interactions are close to the critical buckling 
load, resulting in the collapse of the 
SWCNTs. Fig. 9 presents the eigenvalues 
crλ  of the armchair type SWCNTs as a 
function of its radii, including the results in 
literature. The eigenvalue crλ  
monotonically decreases as the radius of the 
SWCNT increases, indicating that the 
SWCNTs with larger radii tend to collapse 
more easily due to in-layer vdW interaction. 
More importantly, the results of the modified 
MSM are largely lower than those of MSM. 
Using MD simulation, Gao et al. (1998) 
suggested that the armchair type SWCNT 
with a radius larger than the transition region 
(1.077~1.144 nm) is more easily collapsed 
forms. Fig. 9 shows that the eigenvalue crλ  
is very close to unity while the radius 
approaches to the transition region, 
indicating that the SWCNT tends to collapse 
as the radius surpasses this region. The 
results of the modified MSM are 
quantitatively consistent with the above 
results, confirming the accuracy of the 
modified MSM. Furthermore, the results also 
prove the non-circular cross-section of 
SWCNTs found in literature (Hertel et al., 
1998; Hanein et al., 2007). 
Radial deformation of two neighboring 
SWCNTs due to in-layer vdW interactions is 
also performed to further examine the 
validity of present modification. Fig. 10 plots 
the radial deformation δ of two neighboring 
SWCNTs with the same diameter (D=2.0 nm) 
due to vdW interactions, where a 
deformation rate is defined as δ/D (Abrams 
and Hanein, 2007). Table 1 shows the results 
of the modified MSM (7.92%) and the 
experimental results (7.5%, Ruoff et al., 1993; 
5.0 %, Abrams and Hanein, 2007) in the 
literature. Clearly, the results of the modified 
MSM are much closer to the experimental 
results since the radial stiffness of the 
SWCNT has been reduced via the 
modification in modified MSM. Again, the 
validity of the modified MSM is confirmed. 
 
4 Conclusions 
This study proposes a modified MSM 
model to overcome the issue of the 
overestimation of radial stiffness of 
SWCNTs by the original MSM model. Some 
key conclusions are drawn: 
1) The study has successfully developed a 
modified MSM model based on the 
MSM model to precisely calculate the 
radial mechanical properties of 
SWCNTs. In the modified MSM, an 
analytical relation between the moment 
of inertia of the beam and the angle φ for 
various radius is derived, where the 
inversion energy are also considered.
