驗，使用修正隔膜固化製程所製之鈦/碳纖維/聚醚醚酮/鈦三層十字疊奈米複材基層板已成功研製，每
個長×寬×厚=240 釐米×25 釐米×1.55 釐米試片首先會承受鋼球(直徑=12.7 釐米)於一公尺與兩公尺的高
度自由落下，然後試片由室溫下之靜態拉伸試驗來測量其殘留極限強度以及縱向勁度，並視為固定應
力震幅拉伸-拉伸循環測試的基準線。獲得其相應的應力-震次曲線，疲勞強度以及壽命，並且觀察其由
衝擊造成的損傷以及分離的破壞機制。 
即使由 2 公尺自由落下的損傷區域相當明顯，但機械性質並沒有因為低速衝擊而有明顯的減少。
衝擊試片的疲勞抗性也沒有太多損失。這主要歸功於低速衝擊之損傷只發生在受衝擊試片的表面以及

1. Introduction 
Owing to the brittleness of thermosetting matrix resulted by cross-linking, the epoxy resins and 
epoxy-based fiber composites are susceptible to impact damage. Thermoplastics, having greater toughness, 
are considered to have the potential for alleviating this problem [1]. 
For example, during the last ten years, the Defence Research Establishment (DREV) has been studying the 
application of composite materials for generic anti-tank recoilless gun [2]. To achieve the desired weight 
reduction, a graphite-epoxy composite material was used to manufacture the gun tube and venturi. Although 
the ballistic viability of such a design was well proven during tests and evaluations, one major concern that 
remains is sensitivity of the thermoset resin (epoxy) to the low-level damage accumulation due to a mixture of 
normal loading and rough handling in the field. Such damage is generally barely visible, and it is therefore 
important to develop an adequate NDT inspection technique to permit testing as close as possible to an 
operational environment.  
Although damage inflicted by low-velocity impact appears quite complicated, the major failure modes 
include only matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber breakage [3]. As pointed out by Sun and Rechak [3], the 
delamination mode of failure is induced by matrix cracks which occur prior to other failure modes. Thus, 
suppression of matrix cracking will suppress delamination. It is conceivable that the use of tougher matrices 
will yield composites that are more resistant to impact damage. 
Except for the degree of damage, the plate specimens did not differ from beam specimens in failure modes 
or impact tolerance properties [4], i.e., no plate size effect. The postimpact load-carrying capability of a 
composite laminate is of prime concern to the design engineer. After a tool-drop type accident where no 
damage is visible from the surface, the structure is still expected to carry the full spectrum of loading. 
However, it may be wrong of overestimation. In all cases the residual strength decreased as the impact 
velocity increased. From the results [5] the tough matrix composites may provide excellent impact resistance 
properties at low-impact velocities. However, beyond a certain threshold velocity, the use of tough matrix 
materials may result in more laminate tensile and flexural strength reduction than that of brittle matrix 
materials. 
Additionally, the PEEK composites have significantly lower contact rigidity, i.e., for a given contact force 
the resulting indentation in the PEEK composites would be larger, yielding a larger contact area, and, 
therefore, a low contact pressure. A larger contact area with lower pressure will reduce the transverse shear 
stress concentration and thus minimize local matrix cracking. 
From the above-mentioned it is clear that little reduction in strength in the tough PEEK composite 
laminates prior to the low velocity, i.e., ≤ 25m/s. Beyond this point the matrix damage occurred and 
substantial fiber breakage followed. That explains the sudden drop of strength in PEEK laminates when 
impacted at velocities higher than 25m/s. 
Based on the knowledge of merits and disadvantages of PEEK composites within the scope of low velocity 
we fabricated the Ti/APC-2 hybrid nanocomposite laminates to investigate their resistance and mechanical 
properties by tensile and fatigue tests after free drop of a steel ball at 1m and 2m high. The related surface 
treatment and adding nanoparticles are stated as follows. 
Anodic method is a commonly used surface treatment, however, the bonding capability of polymer 
composites to titanium thin plates is still a problem. In order to improve the interfacial bonding capability, 
 6 
2 for example. It should be paid attention that there is a kink angle, i.e., knee, in stress-strain curves of hybrid 
laminates, such as Al/APC-2 and Ti/APC-2 W/WO nanoparticles. 
The stress vs. cycles (S-N) curves for Ti/APC-2 cross-ply composite laminates with and without impact of 
1m high free drop were illustrated in Fig. 3. The S-N curves for Ti/APC-2 cross-ply nanocomposite laminates 
with and without impact of 1m high free drop were also shown in Fig. 4 in contrast. The combined S-N curves, 
normalized by their corresponding ultimate strength, were presented in Fig. 5. The photos of impact 
indentation were shown in Fig. 6. 
4. Discussion 
It is obvious to see the enhancement of mechanical properties by adding the SiO2 nanoparticles in 
Ti/APC-2 nanocomposite laminates in comparison with the virgin laminates, especially a slight increase of 
ultimate strength with the stiffness almost unchanged, as depicted in Tables 1(a) and 2(a). However, after the 
impact of 1m high free drop, the retention of ultimate strength was significantly well, i.e., about 10% more 
due to the spreading of nanoparticles in APC-2 laminae in the hybrid laminates when compared with Tables 
1(b) and 2(b). Similarly, the longitudinal and secant stiffnesses were also kept unchanged. Referring to the 
statement in [4] that PEEK composites can’t resist the damage due to impact at high velocity, i.e., over 25m/s, 
nevertheless, the innovative hybrid laminates fabricated herein may have the capability to sustain the impact 
of high velocity with the improvement of mechanical properties by nanoparticles and metallic sheets. It is the 
urgent topics for further research. 
Generally, it is reasonable that the S-N curves for Ti/APC-2 composite laminates due to impact is lower 
than that of the same virgin laminates without any impact. However, the S-N curves for Ti/APC-2 
nanocomposite laminates with and without impact were very close, i.e., no significant difference. That 
strongly confirmed the above-mentioned concepts of enhancement and improvement of mechanical and cyclic 
properties by adding nanoparticles in APC-2 laminae of Ti/APC-2 nanocomposite laminates. 
Although the area of impacted surface due to 2m high free drop is greater than that of 1m high free drop, 
the reduction of mechanical properties of samples impacted by 2m high free drop is not significant as shown 
in Fig. 7. The main reason is that the damage occurred mostly on the surface area with good retention of 
properties inside the hybrid laminates, i.e., both 1m and 2m high free drop are belonged to low-velocity 
impact. The velocity of 6.28m/s is near a quarter of high velocity, i.e., the high-velocity impact should be over 
25m/s. Additionally, good fatigue resistance of impacted samples due to 2m high free drop can also 
demonstrate the slight damage occurred in the hybrid laminates. Thus, the problem of high-velocity impact is 
a worthwhile topics for further research. 
5. Conclusion 
Ti/APC-2 nanocomposite hybrid laminates were fabricated. The mechanical properties, such as ultimate 
strength and stiffness, were obtained for virgin samples and impacted samples due to 1m and 2m high free 
drop. Based on the received properties the cyclic tests were conducted to obtain the S-N curves for three types 
of laminates. 
The mechanical properties do not reduce significantly due to low-velocity impact, even if the damage area 
is obviously large for 2m high free drop. Similarly, the fatigue resistance of impacted samples does not lose 
much. It is mainly attributed to the damage only occurs on the surface of impacted samples with little 
influence inside the laminates by low-velocity impact. It can be concluded that the enhancement by
