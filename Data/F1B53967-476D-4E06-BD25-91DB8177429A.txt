英文摘要 
In this project, a robust adaptive speed/position tracking control system is proposed for a linear induction 
motor (LIM) taking into account the longitudinal end effects and uncertainties including the friction force. 
The dynamic mathematical model of an indirect field-oriented LIM drive is firstly derived for controlling the 
LIM. On the basis of a backstepping control law, a sliding mode controller (SMC) with embedded fuzzy 
boundary layer is designed to compensate the lumped uncertainties during the tracking control of periodic 
reference trajectories. Since it is difficult to obtain the bound of lumped uncertainties in advance in practical 
applications; in addition, it is a quite complicated process of parameter tuning for the proposed controller due 
to the difficulty arisen from lacking of the accurate mathematical model of a system accompanied with 
unknown disturbance. Thus, an adaptive tuner based on the sense of Lyapunov stability theorem is derived to 
adjust the controller parameters in real-time. Furthermore, it also confronts the increasing disturbance and 
uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated through simulations and 
experiments for several scenarios.  
Keyword: Backstepping control, adaptive control, adaptive fuzzy control, position tracking, linear induction 
motors. 
 
1. 前言 
The linear induction motors (LIM) yield the performance in satisfactory due to the merits such as high 
starting thrust force, simple structure replacement of the gear between motor and motion devices, reduction of 
mechanical losses, and easy maintenance, repairing and replacement [1, 2, 3]. From the aforementioned 
features, the LIM are widely used in the industrial applications, including automation, conveyer systems, 
transportation systems, actuators, material handling, elevators, and sliding door closers, CNC machine, 
robotic arm systems, etc [4].  
From previous introductions, one can find many applications of LIM controllers of the market, so it is 
important to focus on developing the control techniques. Here, the applications can be roughly categorized 
into three major phase: constant loads, varying loads, and position tracking applications. In those constant 
load applications, the load is directly coupled to the motor shaft, and this occurs in transportation systems, 
conveyer systems [5]. On the phase of varying load, the load on the motor devices varies over speed range and

Fuzzy systems have supplanted conventional technologies in many applications, especially in control 
systems. One major feature of fuzzy logic is its ability to express the amount of ambiguity in human thinking. 
Therefore, if the mathematical model of a process does not exist, or exists but with uncertainties, fuzzy logic 
is an alternative way to deal with the unknown process [18]. However, the large amount of fuzzy sets raises 
the system operation complexity for a high-order system. Nowadays, many researchers have tended to 
combine with fuzzy logic and SMC. The main advantage of fuzzy logic controller design based on SMC is 
that the fuzzy rules can be reduced, and the requirement of the uncertainty bound can be released. Wong et al. 
[19, 20] combined a fuzzy controller to remedy the chattering phenomena. However, the parameters of 
membership functions cannot be adjusted to afford optimal control efforts under the increasing of system 
uncertainty. 
The development and implementation of various control methods for induction motors can be carried out 
by using some processors and specific circuits, such like digital signal processes (DSP), filed programmable 
gate array (FPGA), or microcontrollers. Recently, the microprocessors have made advance improvement and 
the operating speed of DSPs have gotten faster. One can easily implement complicated control algorithms in a 
DSP due to the high sampling and calculation frequency [21]. FPGA incorporates the architecture of gate 
arrays and the programmability of a programmable logic device (PLD). It provides flexibility in modifying 
the designed circuit without altering the hardware so that the FPGA-based control implementation can be also 
a choice [22]. During the times go by, the development of mixed-signal integrated circuit technology is more 
mature. As a result, many system-on-chip (SOC) devices have become available. High-throughput 
microcontrollers with embedded programmable memory as well as precision analog and digital peripherals 
can be incorporated into a single integrated circuit. Although the SOC devices show well performance on 
work, the most disadvantage is that the cost actually high to carry out [21].

/m fB K M=  are nominal condition parameters; ΔA and ΔB denote the uncertainties of system parameters 
arisen from M and D; qsu i= is the control input to the motor drive system; ( )f v  denotes the friction forces. 
Considering some mechanical factors such as Coulomb friction, viscous friction and Stribeck effect, and 
friction forces can be approached as follows [33, 34].

−= + − +  (3.4)
where v is the corresponding motor velocity, Kc is the Coulomb friction, Ks the static friction, vs is the Stribeck 
velocity, Kv is the coefficient of viscous friction and sgn(.) is a sign function.  
The eq. (3.2) can be written as 
m m dx A x B u F= + +  (3.5)
where Fd is the system lumped uncertainties and defined as 
( ( ))d LF Ax Bu C F f v≡ Δ + Δ + +  (3.6)
Here, by the fact that the sampling period of a digital processing estimator in practice is shorter in comparing 
with the variation of the system lumped uncertainties. Hence, such lumped uncertainties can be assumed to be 
bounded, that is, 
( )dF t η≤  (3.7)
where η  is a given positive constant. 
To design a position tracking controller, it is reasonable to assume that the reference trajectory *d  and its 
first two derivatives *d and *d  are all bounded function with respect to time. For the objective of position 
tracking, define the tracking error. 
*  ye y y= −  (3.8)
Take its time derivative as 
*  ye y y= −    (3.9)
To design the sliding mode control system, the sliding surface is defined as 
y ys ke e= +   (3.10)
where k is a positive number. 
We assume the lumped uncertainty to be bounded, or |Fd|< mBη , and then choose the Lyapunov candidate as

4. 研究方法(III) 
Generally, the SMC law can be represented as (3.15). The chattering phenomenon induced by the sign 
function in (3.15) exists in SMC system, and is hard to be eliminated in actual device. In order to remedy such 
disadvantage, the concept of fuzzy boundary is introduced to SMC design. The magnitude of the control effort 
is deeply concerned with the fuzzy boundary. At the same time, this fuzzy boundary is related to the 
magnitude of uncertainties to pull the error states back to the sliding surface. Let the sliding surface be the 
input linguistic variable of the fuzzy logic, and the control effort uf be the output linguistic variable. The 
associated fuzzy sets for s and uf are expressed as follows: 
Rule (i): If s is Positive, THEN uf is a decreasing effort. 
Rule (ii): If s is Zero, THEN uf is a normal effort. 
Rule (iii): If s is Negative, THEN uf is an increasing effort.

Fig. 4.1. The input and output membership function. 
The triangular membership function and center average defuzzification method are adopted in the FSMC 
system. In Fig. 4.1, it shows the membership function of input fuzzy set and output fuzzy set. Now, the control 
effort can be expressed as shown below. 
1 3( )fu r ω ω= − −  (3.22)
where ω1, ω2, and ω3 represent the weighting from Rule (i) - Rule (iii), respectively. That is, the sum of such 
weighting is equal to one. 
We can define the Lyapunov function same as that in (3.13) and its time derivative by using (3.14) is 
expressed as

2 1 3( )y d mV ke s sF r B sγ ω ω= − − + − −  
2 2
1 3 ( )y d mke s s F r Bγ ω ω≤ − − + − −  (3.23)
Therefore, the inequality 
1 3

A function 2 ( )W t  is defined as

Then, we can extend equation (3.34) by using (3.31) and (3.32) to yield the following results.

Since 3 ( )V t  is bounded, 3 ( )V t  is nonincreasing and bounded, the following result can be obtained.

Moreover, the function 3 ( )W t  is bounded, and the function 3 ( )W t  is bounded. By applying Barbalat lemma 
[35], we have 
3lim ( ) 0t W t→∞ =  
(3.40)
In the other words, the error state will converge to zero as time goes to infinity. Now that, the proposed 
AFSMC scheme assures the system stability, asymptotic output tracking, and robust control performance. 
 
5. 結果與討論 
In this project, the control bard is used the embedded device NI sbRIO-9642, which is depicted in Fig. 
5.1, and its specification also provides below.

Hence, the data transmitting way is that the control code, which is established in the real-time environment, 
announces the prototype with a FPGA bitstream file so that the configuration of I/O interface is setup. The 
control signals finally are transmitted by a motor drive unit, which is manufactured by Servtronix Motion 
Control Ltd., to the LIM. The typical architecture of the motor drive unit incorporates a PWM inverter with a 
frequency of 16 kHz, an encoder interface with digital filter and a quadruple frequency circuit. Also, the 
feedback signals such like a/b signals are sent over through the motor drive unit back to the embedded control 
board.  
5.1. Simulation 
The friction forces and external load are considered as shown: Fl = 50sin(t); at t ≧ 5 sec, increase the 
tracking frequency. On the other hand, the parameters’ gains of the three controllers are chosen as shown 
20,  10, 10, r 10, 650k γ η ρ= = = = =  
Fig. 5.2 shows the position tracking response of the following three control schemes: SMC, FSMC, and 
AFSMC. In Fig. 5.3, the velocity tracking response for each controller is depicted, and the maximum speed is 
up to 0.75 m/sec. In Fig. 5.4, all three proposed control schemes show tracking performance at t = 1~5 sec. In 
Fig. 5.5, the tracking response of SMC and FSMC schemes become worse at t = 5~10 sec. The external 
disturbance is produced by the primary end effect, which causes the tracking error states increasing. The 
AFSMC system is used to adjust the boundary of the varying disturbance and uncertainties. On the other hand, 
Fig. 5.2 shows the disadvantage of SMC system, which is the chattering phenomenon. The switching function 
in (3.15) concerned with the boundary of uncertainties, and the switching function may induce the chattering 
phenomenon. FSMC system uses the fuzzy logic inference mechanism to eliminate the chattering 
phenomenon. From the results mentioned above, the AFSMC system transcends the SMC and FSMC systems 
to control the mover position of the indirect field-oriented LIM drive.

Form those experimental results we can find that the motor tracking trajectory is a little lagging to the 
command trajectory, the phenomena is caused by the control loop delay. To improve this kind of delay a better 
way is to vary the control loop time interval. However, the trend of the tracking performance is within 
acceptable region.
