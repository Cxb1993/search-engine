Abstract
The present invention relates to an infant
remote monitoring system, in particular to one
that monitors the heat from the breath of a
baby, to aid in the prevention of Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome (SIDS) caused by asphyxia.
This innovative device monitors the airflow
frequency and temperature of the infant’s 
breathing using thermo sensors. These airflow
frequencies, linked with respiratory rates, are
indicated on the monitor. The key advantage
of this innovation is that it requires absolutely
no contact with the baby’s skin, thereby
preventing skin irritations and reducing infant
discomfort normally found with traditional
monitors. The system detects temperature
changes induced by breathing and analyzes
the breathing frequency changes, displaying
the data on both a computer monitor and
L.E.D. array. Data is collected and analyzed
simultaneously via personal computer, which
can be linked to the central nursery room’s 
monitoring system. This device provides a
convenient way for pediatricians or nurses to
detect abnormalities in respiratory frequency
in real time, so they can identify and respond
to any emergency as it is happening, and give
appropriate treatment immediately. Ten clinic
cases have been analyzed and function
validation of the device is performed as well.

1. Background
In order to prevent babies from
succumbing to Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome (SIDS), some hospitals or families
3unit is connected to the control unit. This in
turn, is connected to the warning device. The
warning device is typically located at a
nursing station or another room in the case of
a residential installation. By detecting
deviations in heat patterns, this invention can
provide an almost instantaneous warning of
the onset of any abnormal breathing condition,
thereby significantly helping to prevent
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a preferred
embodiment of the present invention,
including a sensor unit, control unit, and a
warning device.
The sensor unit consists of a supported
canopy and built-in heat detector. The
supporting canopy is shaped so that when
covering a baby, the heat detector will face to
the baby’s nose and mouth directly. The
canopy has a height adjustment mechanism to
ensure the proper position relative to the
infant’s mouth and nose.The heat detector is
composed of a plurality of heat sensors laid
out in an array in the canopy. As shown in Fig.
3, the canopy is installed inside an incubator.
The heat detectors positioned in the canopy,
face directly to the baby’s mouth and nose.
The heat detector sensors are connected to the
control unit.
The control unit comprises a 4-step process,
as shown in Fig. 1. The signals from the
sensor unit are amplified and adjusted for
proper sensitivity, then converted from an
analog to a digital signal, which are then sent
through a microprocessor. The signals are then
sent to the warning device.
The warning device, typically located at a
nursing station, receives the signals from the
control unit in two ways; directly to a warning
speaker and to a computer. From there, the
data can be seen via computer monitor and
heard via speaker.
While this innovative device is in use, the
canopy is adjusted so as to be in the optimum
position around the baby’s head, thus ensuring
direct exposure to the infant’s mouth and nose 
(as shown in Fig. 3). The sensitivity can be
adjusted by the control unit to help the user to
maximize the accuracy and effectiveness of
the system.
2.2 Clinical Setting
This study was planned in two stages and
conducted at Chi-Mei Medical Center (Tainan,
Taiwan). The first stage concentrates on
validating the function of the developed
remote monitoring system. Two healthy adults
are tested. Their respiratory rates and
characteristics are detected both by an
attached apnea monitor and a remote
monitoring system. One adult breathes with a
continuous, controlled respiratory rate. The
other adult breathes in an intermittent manner
to check if any input disturbs the device when
the breathing stops and if the device processes
and displays the respiratory rate in real time.
Data obtained from both devices are compared
to validate the function.
The second stage focused on clinical
monitoring of babies born prematurely at the
hospital and those had other medical
conditions requiring apnea monitoring. Ten
referrals were chosen that met the following
criteria:
(1). All referrals required apnea monitoring,
but had no serious respiratory disease.
(2). All referrals were confirmed by
pediatricians or nurses as being suitable
5mouth and nose. This non-attached (remote)
monitoring system is designed to detect and
display infant RR’s by utilizing 
thermo-sensors. The device monitors the
temperature changes caused by the airflow of
breathing, linking it with the associated RR
value and displays the data on a monitor in
real time. There is no need to use electrodes
applied transthoracically as with the
conventional monitor, therefore avoiding any
possibility of skin irritations or other hazards.
The clinical part of this study involved 10
infants, between 1 and 14 weeks in age, were
recorded (See Table 3). All tests in this case
study were conducted by measuring RR with
both the conventional and the Infant Remote
Monitoring System simultaneously in order to
maximize comparative values. The 10 cases
subjects include 5 male infants and 5 female
infants. Among them, 2 infants were
premature, who participated in a follow-up
clinic with a prescription from their hospitals,
and all the referrals were examined and
confirmed to have no serious breathing
diseases. With these 10 cases of clinical
monitoring, we found that the respiratory
conditions of formerly premature infants are
rather unstable and even exhibited intermittent
apnea. Fig. 7 illustrates typical breathing
signals for infant case #5 (a former premature
infant). Dash lines in the figure demonstrate
the period of time where breathing stops. On
the other hand, full-term infants, such as
infant case #1, breathing tests results are
shown to be comparatively stable (Fig. 8).
