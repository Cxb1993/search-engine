一、中文摘要
本計畫為申請延續 97 年度執行計畫之第二
及第三年研究計畫。主要在發展一同時具備光動
力療法與活體組織氧濃度量測之多功能奈米粒
子。利用激發能量之不同，使鍵結相同光驅動分
子之單一奈米粒子，產生不同之光反應機構，以
具備光動力療法與活體組織氧影像量測的能力；
這 種 設 計 ， 即 是 所 謂 「 同 位 診 治 」
（theragnostics），同時包含治療（therapeutics）
與診斷（diagnostics）功能的醫療研發。
本 計 畫 將 以 中 孔 洞 奈 米 矽 球 （ MSN:
Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle）做為藥物傳輸母
體，鍵結鈀紫質（Pd-porphyrins）於矽球之（一）
中孔洞（nanochannel）中，或（二）矽球骨架
（framework）中。鈀紫質吸收光能量後，放出的
磷光會被環境中的氧焠冷，在高能量時，大部分
的氧被能量轉移激發成為單一氧態（ singlet
oxygen），可作為具備殺死癌細胞能力之第二類
光動力療法試劑；相對應的，以低能量激發時（低
於高能量之 10-4~10-5），所產生之單一氧態濃度
低，無明顯之細胞毒性，但鈀紫質之磷光生命期
因氧焠冷而產生之變化，卻可依 Stern-Volmer
Relationship，計算出有效碰撞範圍內之氧濃度。
同一鈀紫質/奈米矽球在不同之光能量下，即可作
為光動力療法（治療）或組織氧濃度量測（診斷）
兩種不同的功能試劑。而使用中孔洞奈米矽球的
原因，一方面是因為其具有非常高的內生表面積
（約 1000 m2/g）及規律之孔洞大小（直徑約 2.7
nm），可供光驅動分子（如鈀紫質）專一鍵結，
另一方面，則是奈米矽球會經由 endocytosis 進入
細胞，可於細胞內，發揮光動力療法之最大效能。
本計畫將以乳癌細胞（MDA-MB-231）及其
衍生之乳癌模式為標的，藉由發展此多功能之奈
米矽球，建立光動力療法於腫瘤之治療應用下，
腫瘤組織含氧量與第二類光動力療法療效之間的
關係，而此資訊之建立，將作為光動力療法於腫
瘤治療療效評估上不可或缺的環節之一。

Abstract
The current proposal is for the ensuing second
and third year continuation of the 2008 implemented
project. The proposed project is focused on the
development of a multifunctional nanaoparticle
comprising functionalities of photodynamic therapy
(PDT) and tissue oxygenation measurement. By
applying different levels of excitation energy, the
nanoparticle-conjugated photosensitizer would
undergo different mechanisms which serve as
distinct roles for PDT and oxygen measurement.
This is a design named as “theragnostics”, which is
a combination of therapeutics and diagnostics. In
current proposal, mesoporous silica nanoparticle
(MSN) would be synthesized as the carrier for the
photosensitizer of Pd-porphyrin. Pd-porphyrin
could be conjugated either in the (1) nanochannels
or (2) framework of MSN. Upon excitation, the
absorbed photons by Pd-porphyrin would undergo
intersystem crossing and emitted as
phosphorescence. Under high energy excitation,
the absorbed energy of Pd-porphyrin would transfer
to the triplet dioxygen in the close proximity and
which would subsequently turn into its excited state,
the singlet oxygen. With ample singlet oxygen
generated by high energy excitation, it would result
in cytotoxicity against tumor cells. This is
categorized as the type II PDT. On the contrary,
excitation by much lower energy (10-4~10-5 lower in
magnitude) would render no significant cytotoxicity
but the oxygen-dependent quenching of
phosphorescence lifetime, which could be measured
and calculated into oxygen concentration in terms of
Stern-Volmer relationship. The synthesized
Pd-porphyrin/MSN would therefore present itself as
an efficient example of“theragnostics”(therapeutics
with PDT and diagnostics with oxygen
measurement). Using MSN as a carrier is not only
because of its high internal surface area (~ 1000
m2/g) and uniform pore size (~ 2.7 nm in diameter)
but also its ability to be engulfed into cell by
4phosphorescence probe suitable for quantifying
tissue oxygenation and developments of both time-
and frequency-domain instrumentation for
measuring oxygen-dependent quenching of
phosphorescence. Our MSN with high surface
area (1000 m2/g) and uniform pore diameter (2.7 nm)
provides itself with great potential to load not only
contrast agent for in vivo tracking but also other
therapeutic reagent at the same time. In this
propose, we would load MSN with PdTPP, which
would render either in vivo imaging of
tracking/function or therapeutic effect against tumor
in response to different levels of received energy.
This combination of MSN/PdTPP would work for
both tissue oxygenation imaging and on-site
photodynamic therapy (PDT), i.e. as an agent to
bring the concept of simultaneous diagnostics and
therapeutics, namely“theranostics”, to the fore.
三、結果與討論
Although the parallel nanochnannels of MSNs
each communicate directly with the external
environment and, hence, are topologically
indistinguishable from the nanoparticle’s outer 
surface, the tight confines of the nanochannels and
the sheltering they provide enables MSNs to possess
3 distinct, independently-functionalizable domains:
the silica frame itself, the highly-ordered, hexagonal
nanochannels, and the outermost surface of the
nanoparticle (as shown in Scheme 1a). These
domains were sequentially functionalized, initially
with the contrast agent, then with the PDT PS agent,
and lastly with the tumor targeting ligand, as shown
in Scheme 1b. First, the NIR dye ATTO 647N was
incorporated into the silica framework of MSN by
sol-gel chemistry. Prior to the extraction of
surfactants (CTAB) from the nascent MSNs, we
modified the amino groups on the nanoparticles’ 
surfaces in toluene to derive A647@MSN constructs
whose outermost particle surfaces were protected
from the functionalization of the second
(nanochannel) domain. Then, following surfactant
extraction, the porphyrin-based photosensitizer,
PdTPP, was conjugated onto the inner surfaces of
the MSNs nanochannels. It was calculated from
UV-Vis spectroscopy that the A647@MSN-PdTPP
particles contain about 4.4 wt% of the PdTPP
molecules. The final domain to be functionalized
(i.e., outermost surface of particle –for disease
targeting) employed hetero-functional
poly(ethyleneglycol) (NHS-PEG24-Maleimide, MW
1395) and cyclic RGD peptide and consisted of a
two-step process. First, a PEG coating containing
two functional groups, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
ester and maleimide, was given to the MSNs with
amide bonds as crosslinkers to yield
A647@MSN-PEG-PdTPP, to maximize particle
circulation times, minimize nonspecific binding, and
conjugate the targeting ligand. Next, cyclic RGD
(cRGDyK) peptides were attached to the maleimide
groups at the distal ends of the PEG molecules,
resulting in the complete theranostic
A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP. In addition, surface
charges of MSN samples were measured in aqueous
solutions with pH 7.4. The Zeta-potentials of
A647@MSN, A647@MSN-PEG,
A647@MSN-PdTPP, A647@MSN-PEG-PdTPP and
A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP were 31.8, 16.7, 29.8,
9.98 and -4.88, respectively.
Scheme 1. (a) The 3 independently functionalized
domains of MSNs: (1) silica framework, (2) the
nanochannel and (3) outer surface of the
nanoparticle. (b) Synthesis of the tri-functionalized
MSN, A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP.
The structures of A647@MSN,
A647@MSN-PEG and A647@MSN-RGD, without
PdTPP loading, were all characterized by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown
in Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c respectively. The
morphology of all MSN samples was change
slightly and well-dispersed as well as uniform size
around 100 nm. Surface areas and pore size
distributions of the various constructs were
determined via N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm
measurements. Prior to PEGylation and c(RGDyK)
conjugation, A647@MSN had average surface areas
of 1023 m2g-1. After PEG and c(RGDyK)
modification, the surface areas of the PS-free MSNs
were 655 m2g-1 and 617 m2g-1 for A647@MSN-PEG
and A647@MSN-RGD, respectively. Thus, as these
measurements show, the targeted, fluorescent MSNs
retain the overwhelming majority of their ligand
binding sites for drug payload attachement while

uptake of (a) A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP (pink line),
A647@MSN-PEG-PdTPP (green line), and
A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP that had been pre-treated
with c(RGDyK) blocking agent (cyan line) in
U87-MG cells. (b) A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP (pink

A647@MSN-PEG-PdTPP and (d) (f)
A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP. The scale bar is 25 m.
To assess the effects that nanoparticle dosage and
incubation time had upon cellular uptake of the
MSNs, flow cytometry of U87-MG cells given
A647@MSN- RGD-PdTPP was performed, the
results of which are shown in Figure 4. In studies
of incubation time dependence, we combined
A647@MSN- RGD-PdTPP (50g mL-1) with
U87-MG cells for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h in
serum-containing medium. Flow cytometry showed
the percentage of nanoparticles initially given that
U87-MG cells endocytosed were 15, 18, 24.3, 40.5,
53.4, and 66.5% for the aforementioned incubation
times, respectively (Figure 4a). In studies of
nanoparticle dose dependence, we combined
U87-MG cells with one of five different dosages of
A647@MSN- RGD-PdTPP - 10, 25, 50, 100 and
200 g mL-1 - and incubated the mixtures for 2 h at
37℃, followed by washing twice with PBS. As
shown in Figure 4b, the uptake percentages of
nanoparticles were 16.5, 29.7, 42.4, 45.6, and 48.1%
for the aforementioned doses, respectively;
increasing slowly for dosages greater than 50 g
mL-1.
Figure 4. Flow cytometry (a,b) and subsequent
analyses (c,d) of U87-MG (v3 +) cells that had
been incubated for 2 h at 37 oC with
A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP as a function of the dose
of MSNs administered and length of time of
incubation with cells.
To verify the specific targeting capability of
A647@MSN- RGD-PdTPP nanoparticles to the
cancer cells with v3 integrin expression, we
confirmed the dose-dependent uptake of MSNs by
U87-MG cells by pre-treating the cells with various
concentrations of the blocking agent c(RGDyK).
U87-MG cells were combined with one of four
different concentrations of c(RGDyK) - 0.0 (null),
0.5, 1, and 2M - for 2 h at 37℃, then given 50g
mL-1 A647@MSN- RGD-PdTPP nanoparticles and
incubated for another 2 h at 37℃. Flow cytometric
analyses revealed nanoparticle uptake percentages
of 38.5%, 16%, 13%, and 9.6% of the administered
dose for the aforementioned c(RGDyK)
concentrations respectively (Figure 5a, b). Thus the
accumulation of targeted MSNs within U87-MG
cells was effectively inhibited via blocking the cell
v3 integrin binding sites with c(RGDyK) in a
dose-dependent fashion. No significant MSN
fluorescence was observed during confocal
microscopy of nanoparticles (50g mL-1) that had
been incubated with U87-MG cells (2 h at 37℃)
which had been previously treated with 2M
c(RGDyK) blocking agent (Figure 5b inset). These
results indicate the v3 integrin-dependent uptake
of A647@MSN- RGD-PdTPP nanoparticles by
U87-MG cells.

cytotoxicity of A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP and
A647@MSN-PEG-PdTPP in U87-MG (v3+) and
MCF-7 (v3-) cells that had been incubated for 2h
at 37oC and then irradiated at 532nm with 1.2 J/cm2.
Fluorescence microscopy of PI stainings of
U87-MG and MCF-7 cells with (a,b) no MSN
treatment, respectively; (c-e, i-k) with 50g, 25g
and 10g mL-1 of A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP,
respectively, and (f-h, l-n) with 50g, 25g and
10g mL-1 of A647@MSN-PEG-PdTPP,
respectively, as a negative control.
Summarizing the results of our PI staining and
WST-1 assay in Figure 8a, we note there was a
dramatic difference in post-irradiation cytotoxic
response of U87-MG cells that had been treated
with A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP to those that had
been treated with A647@MSN-PEG-PdTPP. Very
few U87-MG cells (~10%) survived treatment with
A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP at any of the three
different concentrations investigated, whereas
MCF-7 cells experienced only a relatively modest
loss (~20%) after irradiation of the same
concentration of nanoparticles (Figure 8b). It
demonstrated that the tri-functionalized MSN,
A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP, is possessed of great
potential as a theranostic nanoplatform for the
traceable, targeted delivery of cancer therapeutics.

and (b) MCF-7 which were treated with
A647@MSN-RGD-PdTPP and
A647@MSN-PEG-PdTPP, with and without
photoirradiation. As can be seen by the graph,
only integrin-expressing cancer cells that
endocytosed RGD-bearing MSNs showed
significant cytotoxic response following exposure to
light.

時間： 九十七年九月八日至九十七年九月十四日
地點： The Acropolis Convention Center, Nice, France
內容： 本次參加會議為 2008 世界分子影像會議（2008 World Molecular
Imaging Congress）。在分子醫學影像成為國際重要研究領域的同時，此次大會
為因應該領域充沛之研究能量及本身跨領域的研究特性，特別由三個國際間重要
的分子影像協會，共同組成成立，其中包括了 Society of Molecular Imaging,
Academic of Molecular Imaging, 以及 European Society of Molecular
Imaging。
分子影像研究已進入一個 booming 的 era，在影像偵測的儀器發展上，也已
走入多功能、多模組影像 fusion 系統的成熟期。從此次大會的議程安排上，也
可以看出主要儀器廠商和幾個重要的大學和醫學中心的緊密合作。從一直以來延
續的 Xenogen 與 Stanford University 到 VisEn 和 Technical University of
Munich 等等的研究開發團隊，影像儀器的進步都已跟生物醫學應用端使用者的
需求相互緊密結合。而本次大會議程的安排，與往年的會議內容明顯不同的地
方，則是開始特別著重 translational 的研究，整體的發展以 Advances in
Molecular Imaging from Bench to Bedside 為主軸，臨床意義跟實用性開始在
研究設計中佔據最重要的篇幅。對於一直以來以 translational research 為主
要研究方向的我們，這次的會議內容可說是非常的 informative。同時也利用這
次的 occasion 與幾個醫學中心的研究團隊，如在 Houston 的 The Methodist
Hospital 之 Imaging Chemistry 團隊，建立了良好的互動。
此次，我們的團隊共有四個 abstracts 被大會接受發表。這些工作皆由國家
衛生研究院醫學工程研究組及奈米醫學中心的團隊，與國外的合作團隊共同完
成。其中，同步偵療（Theranostics）之奈米光動力療法的研究成果是與美國賓
州大學醫學院生物化學與分子生物物理學系的 Prof. Sergei Vinogradov 共同合
作。Prof. Vinogradov 是 porphyrin 紫質化學的知名專家，相關研究相繼發表
在 Nature，Journal of American Chemistry Society 等頂尖國際期刊。另外，
我們研發新的近紅外光中孔洞奈米矽球，並探討其在活體中的生物分佈以及在乳
癌之長期影像偵測和生物穩定性的相關研究，重要指出掌握表面化學在生物分佈
上的關鍵，以及在腫瘤藥物釋放控制上的重要應用。此部分的研究，則是與美國
芝加哥大學醫學院放射醫學系以及分子及功能性醫學影像中心的 Profs.
