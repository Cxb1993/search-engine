 Pasadyn and Edgar (2005) [5] noted that the 
absolute value of the product and tool disturbances 
cannot be estimated independently even if they are 
constant because each run must consist of a specific 
product manufactured on a specific tool.  They 
proposed to use of monitoring wafers to condition of the 
tool.  Firth et al. (2006) [6] proposed a method 
assuming that the tool noise and product noise are 
stationary.  The resulting tool and product estimates 
may be biased, i.e. changes in condition of one tool may 
lead to changes in estimates of disturbance estimates of 
other tools and products.  However, the estimates of 
different threads remained unbiased.  Thus the model 
can be used for control but not fault detection and 
diagnosis. Bode et al. (2007) [8] recognized that specific 
regression techniques must be used to obtain unbiased 
estimates of tool and product states.  
 Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a standard 
statistical tool in the area of linear modeling of 
multi-factor systems (Montgomery, 1997) [9]. In Ma et 
al. (2007) [10], we have proposed a state estimation 
method of a mixed run plant based on analysis of 
variance.  However, the method also assumed that the 
states of the tools are unchanged and a recursive Karman 
filter estimator is used.   In this work, we shall 
relinquish the assumption that the condition of tool is 
unchanged and demonstrate that improved controller 
performance and diagnosis of tool conditions can be 
obtained. 
2 Theoretical Developments 
2.1 Plant 
 Figure 1 shows the schematic plots of a "mixed 
run" manufacturing system. A number of products are 
manufactured on a number of tools.  In each run, most 
operation variables follow a basic recipe for each product.  
After each run, an output y related to the quality of the 
product is measured.  In run-to-run control, certain 
manipulated variable in the recipe will be adjusted based 
on measurement of output variables y of previous runs.  
Consider a simplified multi-tool and multi-product 
production system with a single (quality) output and a 
single (manipulated variable) input.  A sequence of 
production data can be expressed as follows: 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )T P TPi n j n i n , j ny n f x n ,c n ,c n ,c n=    (1) 
In equation (1), yn and xn denote the output and input of 
the nth run. f is a nonlinear function of plant behavior at 
the nth run which depends on the tool characteristics. 
( ) ( )Ti nc n  of the specific tool ( )i n  used, the product 
characteristics ( ) ( )Pj nc n  of the specific product ( )j n  
being manufactured, as well as the interaction 
characteristics ( ) ( ) ( )TPi n , j nc n  of the specific pair tool 
( )i n  and product ( )j n .  In this work, it is assumed 
that there exist no interactions between tools and 
products, and the plant is operated in a very narrow range 
and hence a linear system can represent the plant 
behavior.  Therefore, equation (1) can be simplified as 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )T Pi n j ny n bx n c n c n nε= + + +     (2) 
where ( ) ( )20,n Nε σ∈  being a zero mean white noise 
with variance 2σ , b is the process gain the dependency 
of y and x.  However, the absolute value of tool and 
product characteristics can not be estimated 
independently because each run consists of a specific 
product manufactured on a specific tool.

(ii) If product 1 has never appeared, the operator will 
determine which product in the current window is most 
similar to the unknown product and employ its product 
disturbance term.   
2.5 Step disturbance (shift) compensation 
For many semiconductor processes, preventive 
maintenance (PM) is often implemented due to 
degradation. This causes an abrupt change of tool 
conditions which can be seen as a shift or step 
disturbance in addition to the ARIMA(p,d,q) model.  
Step disturbance may be identified as “intervention 
event” (Box, et al., 1994) [11].  The magnitude of the 
step disturbance can be estimated by maximum 
likelihood method.  Consider a new tool disturbance 
( ) ( ) ( )i i i i i iN k k kω ξ η= +   (12) 
which includes an ARIMA noise 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )i i i i i iB k B kη εΦ = Θ  and an intervention event

sent together with input and output data of the control 
horizon as new data of the next observation window.  
Parameter estimation is then performed with ( )ˆi ikω ξ  
added to the equation (10).   
3. Simulation Study 
To demonstrate the ability of the dynamic ANOVA 
control, a simulation example consisting of two tools and 
three products was used.

The metrology noise is normally distributed with zero 
mean and variance of 0.01, i.e. ( ) ( )20,0.1i ik Nν ∈ . The 
product disturbances are constant with 
[ ]1 2 3, , 6,10,17P P Pc c c⎡ ⎤ =⎣ ⎦ .  The tool disturbances are 
represented by a constant plus an IMA (1, 1) process:

The stochastic parts of the two tool noises are also 
normally distributed with zero mean and variance of 0.04, 
i.e. ( ) ( ) ( )21 1 2 2, 0,0.2k k Nε ε ∈ . The tool and product 
adopted for each run is randomly selected based on a 
given probability of occurrence. The two tools have 
equal probability distribution. The probability 
distributions of product A, B, and C for the examples of 
section 3.1-3.3 are 0.3, 0.3 and 0.4 respectively. 
 In our simulation study, an observation window of 
500 runs and a control horizon of 100 runs were used in 
the implementation of the proposed algorithm which is 
denoted as d-ANOVA.  The observation window is used 
to estimate model parameters and the obtained model is 
adopted in the next control horizon. During the control 
horizon, μ , iτ  and jp  remain constant and iη  is 
updated recursively to capture the tool dynamics. As the 
6 6
process, it is known that aging effects such as the 
depletion of the etch solution or the degradation of the 
thermocouples in high temperature furnaces can induce 
trend or ramp disturbances. We use an IMA (1, 1) 
process, the dynamic term, to characterize the 
disturbance. 2 tools, 6 product and 200 runs are picked 
up to implement the proposed algorithm. The data was 
standardized to have overall mean zero and overall 
variance 1. The controlled output is plotted in Figure 6.

 The control results of dynamic ANOVA algorithm, 
s-ANOVA method and threaded EWMA method for 
different products are summarized in Table 3. The overall 
variances of the output under the control of d-ANOVA, 
and t-EWMA algorithm are 0.93 and 1.04, respectively.  
It should be noted that the three algorithms have almost 
equivalent performance for products with large lot counts, 
P3, P4, P5 and P6.  t-EWMA algorithm guarantees 
asymptotic zero mean offset for individual products.  
Hence for products of large quantity, they have near zero 
offsets.   ANOVA models results in overall zero offsets.  
Hence for large volume products only the overall mean 
of all products are maintained at zero offset.   t-EWMA 
method has poorer performance for infrequent products, 
P1, P2.  This is due to the fact that the tool condition 
may be quite different from the last run of the same 
thread.  d-ANOVA is better than s-ANOVA, no 
intervention events have been detected.  Hence 
inclusion of dynamic term to the ANOVA model is the 
main reason for better performance. 
5. Conclusions 
 It is very important in RtR control of a mixed run 
plant to correctly identify the changes in condition of 
tool as well as the difference in behavior between tools 
and products.  In this work, a novel mixed product 
run-to-run controller is proposed.  The method of 
ANOVA is used to estimate the difference in behavior 
between tools and products and a dynamic term is 
included in the process model to characterize the 
run-to-run disturbance such as drift, shift and/or some 
other unknown disturbances.  The effectiveness of the 
proposed algorithm is illustrated by different simulation 
examples in which scenarios tools drift and shift, product 
going off-line and coming back on-line are examined.  
The effect of product distributions on controller 
performances is also investigated.  It is found that the 
performance of ANOVA based controller for products 
with small quantity is comparable to those with large 
quantity.  The advantage of the d-ANOVA algorithm is 
also demonstrated using an industrial example.
