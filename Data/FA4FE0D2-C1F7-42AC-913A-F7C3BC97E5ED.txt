Abstract：(Keywords：CDMA System, Interference Projection Method, SIC Detector) 
The aim of this report includes the design of a multi-user, multi-path detector for CDMA 
communication system. This work includes the use of interference projection method in training 
phase to estimate the quantity of interference for the user. Then, the channel gain can be estimated 
from the energy point of view. After the channel gain has been estimated, a series interference 
cancellation multi-user detector is used to obtain the signal of data bit transmitted from the user. 
Finally, the comparison of bit-error rate between the traditional multi-user detector and the detector 
by use of interference projection method presented in this project is given through the computer 
simulation. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In the CDMA system, it allows multiple users to communicate simultaneously using the same 
channel. The main technique is using signature waveforms to separate one user from another. Thus, 
there is no physical separation in time or in frequency among signals from users. However, its 
drawback is that users may cause interference to each other unless the transmissions for all users are 
perfectly synchronized and the signature waveforms are mutually orthogonal. This interference 
caused from other users is known as multiple access interference (MAI), and it will degrade the 
performance of the system. Hence, the cancellation of the MAI will improve the performance and 
increase the capacity of the system.  
Consider the multipath environment, it will cause more interference to the desired user. When 
the signals arrive from different paths for any one user, the orthogonality between the spreading 
codes will be violated due to different time delays, and the separation of the code channel is not 
hold anymore. This phenomenon introduces more interference terms than that in single path

which represents the received signal in the mth symbol interval. The vector n is a ( ) 1M D G+ ×  
zero mean complex Gaussian random vector with covariance matrix ( ) ( )2 2 M D Gσ +I in real and 
imaginary part respectively. Therefore, equations (5) and (6) are the continuous and discrete models 
for the K active users with M symbol intervals. 
 
3. Channel Estimation Algorithm 
 
   The channel estimation algorithm in this section is based on least-square procedure and 
steepest-descent recursive adaptation rule. In order to compute the estimated channel gain, we 
change the system model expression a little and introduce a parameter ( )kg t as the channel function  
that combines the amplitudes of users.

5. Simulations 
 
    Assume that the system is a DS/CDMA system with the number of active users K = 3. The 
processing gain is chosen to be G=31, and gold code is used. The channel mode is assumed as  
equation (1). 
In this study, L=2 is used for all users and then equation (1) can be expressed as  
 ( ) ( ) ( )1 1 2 2h t α δ t - τ α δ t - τ= +  (33) 
The channel attenuation factors 1α  and 2α  are modeled as complex zero mean Gaussian random 
variables with variace, or say channel power 2 1channelσ =  in linear value. The maximum delay 
spread mT  is assumed to be less than one symbol interval, i.e., m bT T< . In this condition, 
1m bD T T= =⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥ . The discrete time delay element ,k ld  is randomly generated, and is uniform 
distributed in the interval [ ]0, 1GD − . The lengh of training sequence in power estimation is 16 bits,

             Figure 4. Performance comparison : BER of user 1 vs. 1 0E N with

Figure 3 and Figure 4 depict the performances for these three kinds of receiver with the  
number of active users 3K = , and the interference power 1 3iE E = , and 9dB to the desired user 
respectively. 
    From the results, they show that the performance of the third scheme is close to that of the SIC 
scheme with perfect power control and known channel function. They also show that the 
performance of the third sceheme is better than that of the SIC receiver that uses the power and 
channel gain estimation only.  
 
5. Conclusions 
 
It is well known that the SIC interference cancellation receiver has the advantage to eliminate 
much interference term and get more accurate users’ information value than RAKE [6] receiver. 
However, the power of the users and the channel gains must be known previously. These 
restrictions are not practical in real world application. Hence, in this study, SIC receiver with 
channel estimation and power estimation, which detects information bits according to signal 
amplitude is proposed. In power estimation, the interference projection method is used to estimate 
amplitude of users’ information. In channel estimation, least-square criterion is applied, and 
steepest-descent recursive adaptation rule [7] is used to decrease its computational complexity.
