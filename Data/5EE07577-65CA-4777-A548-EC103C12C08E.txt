I. Introduction 
 
During the last decade, flexibility and mobility have made wireless local area networks 
(WLANs) a rapidly emerging field of activity in computer networking, attracting significant 
interest in the communities of academia and industry. In the meantime, the IEEE standard for 
WLANs, IEEE 802.11 [1], has gained global acceptance and popularity in wireless computer 
networking markets, and is anticipated to continue being the preferred standard for supporting 
WLANs applications in the near future.  
According to the actual version of the standard, the backoff parameters of its collision 
avoidance mechanism are far from the optimal setting in some network configuration conditions, 
especially in a congested or noisy scenario [3-7]. In the first instance, the collision avoidance 
portion of CSMA/CA is performed by a variable time-spreading of the users’ access. The stations 
start to transmit their frames in random moments to decrease the probability of collision. 
However, collisions still occur if two or more stations select the same backoff slot. When this 
happens, these stations have to reenter the competition with an exponentially increasing backoff 
parameter value, and the increase of the backoff parameter value after collisions is the mechanism 
provided by CSMA/CA to make the access adaptive to channel conditions. This strategy avoids 
long access delays when the load is light because it selects an initial (small) parameter value of 
contention window (CW) by assuming a low level of congestion in the system. However, it incurs 
a high collision probability and channel utilization is degraded in bursty arrival or congested 
scenarios. In other words, this strategy might allocate an initial size of CW, only to find out later 
that it is not enough when the load is increased. The size of CW must then be reallocated with a 
larger size, but each increase of the CW parameter value is obtained at the cost of a collision 
(bandwidth wastage). Furthermore, after a successful transmission, the size of CW is set again to 
the minimum value without maintaining any knowledge of the current channel status.  
Secondly, the performance of the CSMA/CA access method will be severely degraded not only 
in congested scenarios but also when the bit error rate (BER) increases in the wireless channel. 
One principal problem also comes from the backoff algorithm. In the CSMA/CA access method, 
immediate positive acknowledgement informs the sender of successful reception of each data 
frame. This is accomplished by the receiver initiating the transmission of an acknowledgement 
frame after a small time interval, SIFS, immediately following the reception of the data frame. In 
case an acknowledgement is not received, as we mention above, the sender will automatically 
presume that the data frame is lost due to collision, not by frame loss. Consequently, when a timer 
goes off, it exponentially increases backoff parameter value and retransmits the data frame less 
vigorously. The idea behind this approach is to alleviate the probability of collision. 
Unfortunately, wireless transmission links are noisy and highly unreliable. Path loss, terminal 
noise, fading, and interference may cause significant bit errors. What this means is that an 
unacknowledged frame could result from not only collision but also frame loss. The proper 
approach when dealing with lost frames is to send them again, and as quickly as possible. 
Extending the backoff time just makes matters worse because it creates bandwidth wastage. In 
other words, when a frame is collided on a wired network, the sender should slow down. When 
one is lost on a wireless network, the sender should try harder, and it will be unnecessary if the

There have been several results (mostly based on simulation) reported in literature about the 
enhancement of the IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol to increase its performance for WLANs. Along 
this line of study, attempts have been made to approximate the knowledge about the number of 
users involved in the access by exploiting the history of the system. Aside from the difficulty 
involved in acquiring sufficient knowledge, this type of approximation tends to be 
computationally expensive, and subject to significant errors, especially in high contention 
situations. In this section, we delineate the proposed scheme in detail. The proposed scheme is 
based only on carrier sensing and can be implemented in present IEEE 802.11 WLANs easily 
without requiring any complicated computation or additional hardware support. However, to 
operate such a mechanism, the proposed scheme needs to estimate the current wireless channel 
bit error rate at run time. In [20], the author states that the channel error rate, determined using 
the checksum of each packet, is a suitable measure to give an indication of the link quality. 
Besides, previous works have shown that it is possible to evaluate the real-time channel BER 
based on statistical analysis [21-22]. Hence, we can apply these techniques to predict the BER of 
a wireless channel to the proposed scheme. 
Assuming that there are M stations working in asymptotic conditions in the system, this means 
that the transmission queue of each station is assumed to be always nonempty. To simplify the 
analysis, we assume a geometric distributed backoff time of CSMA/CA. This protocol differs 
from the standard protocol only in the selection of the backoff interval. Instead of the binary 
exponential backoff used in the standard, the backoff interval of p-persistent CSMA/CA is 
sampled from a geometric distribution with parameter p. That is, at the beginning of an empty 
slot a station starts the transmission of a frame with probability p, and defers the transmission 
with probability 1-p and then repeats the procedure at the next empty slot. In probability theory, if 
the probability of success on each trial of transmission is p, then the probability that there are x 
failures of transmission before the first success is ppxXP x ⋅−== −1)1()( . Hence, the average 
contention window size, W , is completely identified by the p value, i.e.,

By solving the above equation, we get: 
of the current contention window, and it is worth noting that bslot  includes collisions, lost 
frames, and successful transmission. Recall that the probability fp  is defined as the probability 
that a frame transmitted by the considered station fails. Since in each busy slot an eventual frame 
transmission would have failed, the probability fp  can be obtained by counting the number of 
experienced collisions ( cslot ) , frames loss ( lslot ), as well as the number of observed 
successfully transmitted slots ( sslot ), and dividing this sum by the total number of observed slots 
( tslot ) on which the measurement is taken, i.e.:

In practice, the value of α  has to be updated in every backoff interval to reflect the actual state 
of the channel. It is intuitive to observe that the value of the utilization factor, α , provides a 
lower bound for the actual number of stations trying to access the channel during the last 
contention window because some stations may transmit in the same slot. However, we still need 
to engineer the tight upper bound of α  to help us complete this scheme. To this end, let us 
consider a p-persistent CAMA/CA in which each station uses the optimal value of p parameter 
( optp ) to maximize the channel throughput. Suppose there are M stations making a transmission 
attempt in a slot, and }{ iMp =  is the probability of which exactly i  stations transmit in a slot. 
Since }0{ =Mp  is the probability that a slot remains empty, we have

opt . Note that the collision probability is low if the 
stations utilize the optimal value of p  parameter ( optp ), meaning that 
}0|1{}0|1{ >=<>> MMpMMp . As a consequence, optpM ⋅  is a tight upper bound of α  
in a system operating with the optimal channel utilization level.  
As we mentioned before, the average size of contention window W  is 12 −

 when a station 
transmits in a slot with probability p. Substituting M and fp  as expressed in equation (4) and 
equation (7) respectively, we can obtain the approximated optimal contention window size ( optW )

Note, however, that in the IEEE 802.11 protocol, the RTS/CTS mechanism is employed to 
improve performance as it shortens collision duration and addresses the hidden terminal problem. 
Unexpectedly, we found that the RTS/CTS mechanism is not beneficial in high noise WLAN 
environments. When the channel is lossless, the RTS/CTS mechanism achieves better 
performance than the basic access method, especially in a congested scenario, due to the shorter 
collision duration. Conversely, as the analytical results reveal, the basic access method 
outperforms the RTS/CTS mechanism in a high noise channel. Our explanations are as follows. 
In the RTS/CTS mode, a station starts its transmission sequence by transmitting the RTS frame. 
When it receives the CTS frame, it knows that the medium is reserved for its transmission. Then 
it transmits the data frame and waits for an ACK frame to verify a successful transmission. 
However, since the RTS and CTS are short frames, the probability of corrupting those frames due 
to noise is small in comparison with relatively long data frames. What this means is that the 
sender will presume that the communication is established after it received the CTS frame, only 
to find out later that the transmission is unsuccessful when the ACK timeout timer expired. 
 
IV. Simulations and Performance Evaluation 
 
  In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. 
 
A. Simulation Environment 
 
Our simulation model is built using the network simulator NS2 [19]. The model represents a 
BSS in the IEEE 802.11a standard WLANs with all stations in the BSS (Basic Service Set) 
capable of directly communicating with the remaining parties. In other words, the transmitting 
power used for each station is assumed to be high enough to cover a 250 meter transmission 
range. To focus on the access control issue and to reduce the complexity of the simulation, what 
follows are the basic assumptions in our simulation environment. First, the “hidden terminal” and 
the “exposed terminal” problems are not addressed in the simulation model. Second, no stations 
operate in the “power-saving” mode. Third, no interference is considered from any nearby BSS. 
Fourth, transmission errors are generated according to the Gaussian channel assumption and 
finally, the transmitted propagation delay is 1 sμ . This is a realistic assumption if the transmission 
distances between stations are of ten meters. 
The evaluation is made with respect to the frame blocking (collision and frame lost) rate and 
achievable throughput under a different number of stations and channel BER. We carry out 
experiments with three different operation modes: basic access method, RTS/CTS mechanism, 
and proposed scheme. CBR applications are used as traffic generators. The default values used in 
the simulation are listed in Table I. The values for the simulation parameters are chosen carefully 
The backoff parameters in the IEEE 802.11 DCF access method are far from the optimal 
setting in a heavy-load and error-prone WLAN environment. First, this strategy incurs a high 
collision probability and channel utilization is degraded in bursty arrival or congested scenarios. 
Besides, in the noisy and highly unreliable wireless environment, an unacknowledged frame 
could result from not only collision but also frame loss. When the sender is unable to discriminate 
the cause of the frame loss, it is difficult to make the correct decision. In this paper, we attempt to 
identify the relationship between backoff parameters, contention level and channel BER and put 
forth a pragmatic problem-solving solution. The proposed scheme is performed at each station in 
a distributed manner, and it can be implemented in the present IEEE 802.11 standard with 
relatively minor modifications. Through extensive simulations, we have demonstrated a 
satisfactory performance of our proposed scheme in a quantitative way. It shows that the 
proposed scheme has proven satisfactory superiority in most cases. Most notable is the 
remarkable improvement in a congested and noisy wireless environment, even with numerous 
stations.
