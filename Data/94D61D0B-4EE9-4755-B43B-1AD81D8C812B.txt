For 6W vehicles, Pillar and Braun [5] 
proposed a coordinated mode to obtain more 
maneuverability than the FWS mode, such that 
the vehicle can negotiate a turn with the 
Ackerman steering angle at the front axle.  The 
coordinated mode is designed to apply the same 
wheel steering angle at the middle and rear axles 
as 
,max
max
f deadband
m r f
δ δδ δ δδ
−= = ×         (1) 
where δm and δr are the wheel steering angles at 
middle and rear axles, respectively; δf and δf,max 
are the wheel steering angle and its maximum 
allowable value at the front axle, respectively; 
δmax is the maximum allowable wheel steering 
angle at the middle and rear axles; and δdeadband is 
a function of the longitudinal vehicle speed.  
Equation (1) only considers the kinematic 
constraint.  In order to reduce the sideslip angle, 
Huh et al. [6] used a simple 2 degree-of-freedom 
(DOF) model to develop a 6WS control strategy.  
Huh assumed that 
0.5m fδ δ=          (2) 
and designed δr as 
1 2r fk k rδ δ= +           (3) 
where r is the yaw rate; k1 and k2 are determined 
such that the numerator of the transfer function 
from δf to the sideslip angle β is zero.   
However, Huh’s approach does not consider 
yaw rate following and is not be able to track the 
desired yaw rate response of the target vehicle.  
In order to achieve the zero sideslip angle and 
target yaw rate responses simultaneously, the 
constraint of Equation (2) is released to obtain 
the maximum control authority in this paper.  
Both δm and δr are controlled using the linear 
quadratic regulator (LQR) technique with 
integral control.  An estimator to be used with 
the control law is used to provide the estimate of 
β, which is not measurable in reality.  The 
proposed control strategy and the estimator are 
both designed based on Huh’s 2DOF linear 
model.  AutoSim is used to establish a complex 
vehicle model, which can be used together with 
the single-point preview driver model.  In order 
to assess the robustness of Huh’s and proposed 
strategies with respect to model uncertainties, 
both strategies will be evaluated using the 
complex model under various open-loop and 
closed-loop maneuvers in Matlab/Simulink. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows: the modeling of the 6W vehicle and the 
driver model are presented in Section 2.  
Followed by the description of the proposed 
control strategy in Section 3.  Simulation 
results using the complex model are presented in 
Section 4.  Finally, conclusions are made in 
Section 5. 
 
2. MODELING 
2.1 Complex Model 
The 18 DOF 6W vehicle model (see Fig. 1), 
which includes three translational (longitudinal, 
lateral, and vertical) and three rotational (roll, 
pitch, and yaw) motions of the sprung mass, and 
jounce (vertical) and rotational motions of six 
wheels (unsprung masses), is established using 
AutoSim in this paper.   
2.1.1 Vehicle Dynamics 
AutoSim [7] is a code generator for 
producing computationally efficient simulation 
programs for multi-body dynamics.  It can 
compile a description of the 6W vehicle in 
ASCII format into c-mex codes, which can then 
be used to study the handling performance of the 
proposed strategy in Matlab/ Simulink. 
The multi-body system similar to the one in 
[6] is divided into several component bodies in 
AutoSim.  These bodies are arranged in a 
parent-child relationship as shown in Fig. 2.  
The first body is the inertial frame used to define 
the coordinates of the other bodies.  The yaw 
frame is a massless body with two translational 
DOF in the x (longitudinal) and y (lateral) 
directions and one rotational DOF for yaw-plane 
motion.  The second body is the sprung mass, 
which is a child of the yaw frame and has one 
translational DOF in the z (vertical) direction 
and two rotational DOF for roll and pitch 
motions.  The sprung mass has the front right 
(FR), front left (FL), middle right (MR), middle 
left (ML), rear right (RR), and rear left (RL) 
wheels as its children.  These wheels are 
marked as 1 to 6 in Fig. 2 and each has one 
translational DOF in the z direction 
perpendicular to the ground. 
2.1.2 Tire Dynamics 
The longitudinal tire force Fxi can be 
6 
stiffness of the front, middle, and rear axles, 
respectively. 
    Simulation results of the linear and complex 
models under step steering, which is defined to 
be δf = 2 deg with the rate change limited to 4 
deg/s in this paper, at vehicle speed equal to 10 
m/s are shown in Fig. 4.  We can observe some 
inconsistencies, which are mainly due to the roll 
motion and tire dynamics of the complex model. 
2.3 Single-point Preview Driver Model 
The purpose of the proposed strategy is to 
make the 6W vehicle easier to handle for the 
driver, such that target yaw rate following and 
zero sideslip angle can be achieved at the same 
time.  If the proposed strategy serves as the 
inner closed-loop control for the 6W vehicle, the 
driver actually closes the outer loop between the 
vehicle dynamics and the road environment.  It 
is not a trivial problem to optimize the inner loop 
control with respect to the outer loop control.  
In order to simplify the problem, we only focus 
on the optimization of the inner loop control in 
this paper.  A single-point preview driver model 
[11] is used to generate the realistic front wheel 
steering input for evaluating the proposed 
strategy for closed-loop maneuvers.  The block 
diagram of the driver model is shown in Fig. 5, 
where Kp is the proportional control gain; τd is 
the human time delay; ζ and ωn are the damping 
ratio and natural frequency of the neuromuscular 
dynamics [12], respectively.   
The driver model generates δf according to 
the previewed lateral displacement error ye 
between the traveled and desired trajectory [10], 
which can be obtained as follows.   ( ) ( )0 0sin cose t p t py X X Y Yψ ψ= − − −     (16) 
where X and Y are the longitudinal and lateral 
positions in the global coordinate, respectively; 
ψ is the yaw angle; the subscript 0, p, and t 
denote for the current, previewed, and target 
values, respectively.  The previewed vehicle 
position in the global coordinate can be 
expressed as follows. 
0 0 0cos sinp p pX X x yψ ψ= + −     (17) 
0 0 0sin cosp p pY Y x yψ ψ= + +      (18) 
where x and y are the longitudinal and lateral 
positions in the body coordinate, respectively. 
If we assume constant longitudinal speed and 
lateral acceleration, the previewed vehicle 
positions in the body coordinate can be 
expressed as follows. 
0 0p px x u T= +     (19) 
21
20 0 0p p y py y v T a T= + +        (20) 
where ay is the lateral acceleration and Tp is the 
preview time.   
 
3. OPTIMAL STEERING CONTROL 
The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) 
technique is applied to solve the steering control 
problem for the 6WS vehicle in this paper.  The 
gain matrix K of the full-state feedback law can 
be obtained by solving the associated algebraic 
Riccati equation as 
1T T−+ − + =A P PA PBR B P Q 0      (21) 
K can then be obtained as 
1 T−=K R B P        (22) 
such that the following cost function J  is 
minimized.

where Q and R are the weighting matrices for 
state deviations and input efforts, respectively.

diagonal Q and R as follows.

where βmax and rmax are the maximum acceptable

and δr, respectively.   
The block diagram of the LQR control with 
the reference input vector r = [βref  rref]T is 
shown in Fig. 6.   
where βref = 0 and rref are the reference 
commands for zero sideslip angle and target yaw 
rate following, respectively.  In order to 
enhance the yaw motion response, rref is selected 
to be the yaw rate response of the FWS 2DOF 
linear model multiplied by a gain factor larger 
than 1 in this paper.  The control law with the 
reference input can be expressed as follows.

where N  is the feed-forward matrix for the 
reference input as follows.

The overall structure of the proposed steering 
control strategy is shown in Fig. 11. 
 
4. SIMULATION RESULTS 
4.1 Open-loop Maneuver  
The same step steering input used previously 
is specified as the open-loop maneuver to 
evaluate the performance of the proposed 
strategy.  The vehicle is accelerated to 10 m/s 
and start to execute the open-loop maneuver at 
15 sec.  The simulation results of vehicle 
responses are shown in Fig. 12.   
The time integral of the absolute sideslip 
angle ∫|β|dt and the maximum absolute sideslip 
angle |β|max are chosen as the indexes to evaluate 
the performance of sideslip angle regulation in 
this paper.  These two indexes for different 
control strategies are summarized in Table 1.  
The performance indexes of the LQR + I results 
in Fig. 9 are defined as the optimal solution, 
which is used to understand the applicability of 
linear model for the proposed control design.  
The smaller the values, the better performance 
the associated control strategy has.  It is 
observed that the proposed strategy deteriorates 
with the unmodeled nonlinearities of the 
complex model.  However, it still has the 
second smallest values for both indexes.  
Therefore, it is determined that the proposed 
strategy has the best performance of sideslip 
angle regulation for the complex model under 
step steering maneuver.

0.0245
|β|max 
(deg) 
0.3583 0.4724 0.2232 0.0353
 
The proposed strategy can track the target 
yaw rate while maintaining the sideslip angle 
much closer to zero than that of Huh’s approach.  
Since Huh’s control gains are determined using 
the linear transfer function as shown in Section 1, 
the performance of sideslip angle regulation 
might deteriorate due to the unmodeled 
nonlinearities of the complex model.  The 
steering angles of the proposed strategy are 
shown in Fig. 13.  Both δm and δr are within the 
reasonable steering ranges. 
4.2 Closed-loop Maneuvers  
Two closed-loop maneuvers (lane change 
and right turn) are executed using the driver 
model at vehicle speed equal to 10 m/s.  The 
trajectory responses of lane change and right 
turn maneuvers are shown in Fig. 14 and 17, 
respectively.   The proposed strategy can track 
the target yaw rate while maintaining the sideslip 
angle much closer to zero than that of Huh’s 
approach, even with the driver in the loop.  The 
corresponding path errors, which are defined to 
be the area between the desired and actual 
trajectories, for different control strategies are 
shown in Table 2.  The smaller the value, the 
closer trajectory tracking the driver can achieve.  
Since the proposed strategy has the smallest path 
errors for both maneuvers, it is easiest for the 
driver to achieve desired trajectory tracking.

The vehicle responses for both maneuvers 
are shown in Fig. 15 and 18, respectively.  The 
performance indexes of sideslip angle regulation 
for both maneuvers are summarized in Tables 3 
and 4, respectively.  Since the proposed 
strategy has the smallest values for both 
maneuvers, it has the best performance for 
sideslip angle regulation.

ADAPTIVE IDLE SPEED CONTROL FOR SPARK-IGNITION 
ENGINES

ABSTRACT 
Due to the nonlinear time-varying nature of the spark-
ignition engine, an adaptive multi-input single-output 
(MISO) controller based on self-tuning regulator (STR) is 
proposed for idle speed control in this paper.  The spark 
timing and idle air control are simultaneously employed 
as control inputs for maintaining the desired idle speed, 
and are designed based on P and PI type STR, 
respectively.  The Recursive Least Square technique is 
employed to identify the engine as a first-order MISO 
linear model.  Pole placement technique is then used to 
design the adaptive MISO controller.    Performances of 
the proposed algorithm are evaluated using a nonlinear 
engine model in Matlab/Simulink.  The system 
parameters with 10% uncertainties are also utilized to 
perform the associated robustness analysis.  Preliminary 
simulation results show significant reduction of speed 
deviations under the presence of torque disturbances and 
model uncertainties. 
INTRODUCTION 
Vehicles consume about 30 percent of fuel during idling 
in city driving scenarios [1].  An effective Idle Speed 
Control (ISC), which maintains the idle speed close to the 
designed value, can not only reduce fuel consumption 
and emission, but also increase combustion stability.   
Takahashi [2] proposed a linear quadratic optimal control 
using a two-state linear engine model, which is identified 
using the least square method with idle air control (IAC) 
and engine speed as the input and output, respectively.  
The performance index consists of the speed deviation 
and control effort.  The experimental results showed that 
the controller can immediately suppress the effect of 
various torque disturbances, such as air conditioner on-
off, clutch engagement, coasting, etc.  Butts [3] proposed 
a controller consisting of the feedback linear quadratic 
Gaussian (LQG) optimal control and the feedforward 1A  
optimal controller based on linearized engine model for 
ISC.  IAC is used as the only actuator.  The simulation 
and experimental results showed that the proposed 
controller can reject step load disturbances at steady 
state by LQG optimal controller, and reduce the peak 
speed deviation with acceptable control effort by the 
feedforward 1A  optimal controller.  Lu [4] proposed a 
discrete sliding mode controller, and used IAC as an 
actuator for the ISC.  The simulation and experimental 
results showed that the proposed algorithm possesses a 
smooth and quick transient response without steady-state 
errors under the presence of the torque disturbances.   
Since the effect of spark timing control on the dynamic 
response of engine speed is faster than the IAC, Deur [5] 
simultaneously employed spark timing control and IAC for 
ISC, and utilized the least-squares estimation to identify 
the engine as a third-order model with the throttle angle 
and engine speed as input and output, respectively.  PI, 
PID, and polynomial controllers are designed according 
to the identified linear engine model for the throttle control.  
Proportional control is then used for spark timing control.  
The simulation results showed that the polynomial 
controller contains lower noise sensitivity and better 
torque disturbance rejection.  Yang [6] proposed a sliding 
mode control scheme to coordinate throttle and spark 
advance for ISC.  The simulation results show that the 
proposed strategy can minimize idle speed variations 
under the rapid torque disturbances, system 
nonlinearities, and uncertainties.  Sun [7] proposed an 
optimal control algorithm and utilized the spark timing and 
IAC as the actuators for ISC.  The performance index 
consists of the speed deviations, spark timing deviated 
from maximum brake torque (MBT) timing, and IAC valve 
opening rate.  The simulation results showed that the 
proposed algorithm under the load disturbance has faster 
settling time and smaller speed deviation than the 
traditional PID controller using only IAC. 
An adaptive multi-input single-output (MISO) controller 
based on self-tuning regulator (STR) is proposed for ISC 
in this paper.  The spark timing and IAC are 
simultaneously employed as control inputs for 
maintaining the desired idle speed, and are designed 
based on P and PI type STR, respectively.  The 
Recursive Least Square (RLS) technique is employed to 
identify the engine as a first-order MISO linear model.  
Pole placement technique is then used to design the 
adaptive MISO controller for maintaining the idle speed at 
700 rpm.  A combination of different load torque patterns 
is used as disturbances to evaluate the performances of 
where ,ai IACVm  is the mass airflow through the IAC valve; 
and aom  is the mass airflow from the intake manifold into 
the cylinder, which can be expressed as follows:

ao v
a im
P Vm
R T
ωηπ=                                (7) 
where dV  is the displaced cylinder volume; ω  is the 
engine speed; and vη  is the volumetric efficiency [9]. 
BY-PASS AIR FLOW DYNAMICS  
The IAC valve controls the amount of by-pass air flow into 
intake manifold for maintaining idle speed, as shown in 
Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2.  IAC valve 
The by-pass air flow dynamics can be modeled as a one-
dimensional isentropic compressible flow, which is similar 
to Equations (1) and (2) with the ,d imC  and thA  replaced 
by the discharge coefficient ,d IACC  and cross-sectional 
area IACA  of the IAC valve.  The IACA  can further be 
expressed using Equations (3) and (4) with D , d , and 
thθ  replaced by the bore diameter IACD , the shaft 
diameter IACd , and opening angle IACθ  of the IAC valve, 
respectively. 
TORQUE DYNAMICS  
The indicated torque indT  is defined as a function of 
engine speed, air mass flow rate into cylinder, air-fuel 
ratio, and spark advance angle, and can be expressed as 
follows [9].

where indT  is the indicated torque; ittΔ  is the intake to 
torque production delay; and sttΔ  is the spark to torque 
production delay.  AFI  is the normalized air fuel ratio 
influence, which is a function of air-to-fuel ratio λ . 
The normalized spark influence SI  is a function of spark 
advance/retard from MBT ignition timing, as follows: 
2.875(cos( ))SI SA MBT= −                        (9) 
where SA  is spark advance angle.  The torque constant 
Tc  can be used to represent the maximum engine torque 
capacity with 1AFI =  and 1SI = .   
ENGINE ROTATIONAL DYNAMICS 
The engine rotational dynamics is modeled as: 
ind fric load e eT T T I bα ω− − = +                           (10) 
where loadT  is the external load torque; fricT  is the friction 
torque [9], which is a function of engine speed; α  is the 
angular acceleration of the engine; eI  is the engine 
rotational inertia; and eb  is the damping constant of the 
crankshaft bearing. 
CONTROL ALGORITHM  
The proposed ISC consists of two parts: system 
identification and adaptive controller, as shown in Figure 
3. The spark advance angle SA  and IAC valve opening 
angle IACθ  are simultaneously employed as the control 
inputs for maintaining the designed idle speed.

2 22 0n ns sζω ω+ + =                        (20) 
where ζ  and nω  are the desired damping ratio and 
natural frequency, respectively.  The reference model in 
discrete-time domain can then be obtained with sample 
time (frame time of the target ECU) st =10 ms, as shown 
below.

If we match the polynomial coefficients of the 
denominator of Equation (18) with Equation (19), the 
control parameters 2r , 0s , and 1s  can be solved as 
follows:

Moreover, the coefficients 0s  and 1s  are function of 2s , 
which is an adjustable design parameter and is designed 
as P control for spark timing. 
Generally, 1( )z−T  is used to reduce the steady-state error 
without increasing the system order, thus it can be solved 
by setting the DC gain of the closed-loop transfer function 
in Equation (18) to be 1.  1( )z−T  can then be obtained as

The spark advance angle SA  is always maintained at 
MBT for maximum torque output.  When load torques are 
imposed on the engine, the engine speed reduces and 
the SA  should be advanced to increase the torque output.  
However, if SA  is advanced more than the MBT, it will 
reduce the torque output according to Equation (9).  
Therefore, the SA  is saturated at MBT for the spark 
timing control in this paper.  
Since the P type controller is used for spark timing, 2 2t s=  
is selected in this paper.  The adaptive MISO control law

SIMULATION RESULTS  
A nonlinear engine model is established in 
Matlab/Simulink to evaluate the performances of the 
traditional PI controller using only IAC, the MISO 
controller without the adaptation, and the proposed 
adaptive MISO controller.  The desired natural frequency 
nω  and damping ratio ζ  of the reference model are 
selected to be 1.2 rad/sec and 1, respectively.  The 
identified system parameters from Section 3 are used as 
the initial conditions for the RLS, i.e. 
[ ]0ˆ 0.997 2.5 0.009 T= − −Θ .  If the adaptation of the 
proposed algorithm is turned off, the associated 
simulation results are referred as MISO only in the 
following figures.  The same reference model and 
identified parameters a  and 1b  are also used to design 
the traditional PI controller (using only IAC) by the pole 
placement technique.  The external load torque profile is 
the speed back to the desired value faster, as shown in 
the zoom-in plot on Figure 8.   
The spark advance angle retarded from MBT, i.e. 
rSA SA MBT= − , of the proposed algorithm is shown in 
Figure 11.  As mentioned in Section3, the SA  is saturated 
at MBT for the spark timing control.  Therefore, rSA  is 
lower saturated at 0 deg.  The large spark timing controls 
of the MISO controller without adaptation and the 
proposed adaptive algorithm can retard the SA from the 
MBT quickly.  Thus reduce the torque output promptly 
and bring the speed back to the desired value faster than 
the traditional control using only IAC.  This eases the 
remaining work for the IAC to regulate the engine speed.

Figure 11.  Spark advance angle retarded from MBT 
If the IAC valve and the damping of the crankshaft 
bearing are affected by carbon deposition and wear, 
respectively, the performance of the MISO controller 
without adaptation maybe degraded due to model 
uncertainties.  The system parameters IACA , ,d IACC , and 
eb  with 10% error are employed to assess the robustness 
of each control algorithm.  The simulation results are 
shown in Figures 12 and 13.  The speed deviation of 
proposed algorithm is smaller than that of the traditional 
PI and MISO only algorithms.  Since the proposed 
adaptive algorithm can on-line estimate system 
parameters and adjust the control gain, it can mitigate the 
impact of the model uncertainties and thus maintain the 
desired control performance.  Because the traditional PI 
and MISO only algorithms are designed based on open-
loop identified system parameters without adaptation, 
they are significantly affected by the model uncertainties.  
Thus results in larger speed deviations.
