 where ∆  is the displacement of the specified node, iu  is the member force of the i-th member when 
the specified node is subjected to an unit load, and i∆  is the i-term of ∆ . In Eq.(3), iE  and iL  are 
constant values; iS  and iu  are function of cross-section sizes, but are not sensitive to the 
cross-section size. Therefore, iA  and i∆  are almost inversely proportional to each other. If 0>∆ i , 
then magnifying iA  decreases ∆ . Conversely, if 0<∆ i , then magnifying iA  increases ∆ . 
Therefore, the following assumptions are used to help develop a heuristic cross-section size 
modification:  
Assumption 1: Only the members corresponding to positive i∆  require magnifying their 
cross-section sizes. 
Assumption 2: The magnification of iA  is positively proportional to i∆  because reducing large 
i∆  can quickly reduce ∆ . 
Assumption 3:  The magnification of iA  is negatively proportional to weight of the member 
because magnifying cross-section size of a heave member seems to be not a good 
idea. 
Hereafter, the heuristic cross-section size modification method is defined as follows: 
If each member of a structure has an individual cross-section size,

corresponding to m-th member of l-th cross-section size group, and mlW ,  is the weight of m-th 
member of l-th cross-section size group. 
By using the modified cross-section sizes in Eq.(2), the displacement of the specified node can 
be represent as a function of K and β :

Notably, when β  is a predefined value, a value K can be found to make ),( βK∆′  equal allowable 
displacement ( a∆ ). The modified cross-section sizes ( iA′ ) can then be obtained from the value of K. 
Eq.(5) generally does not provide precise estimation of specific node displacement because the 
member forces iS  and iu  of the truss structure are changed slightly after modifying the 
cross-section size. To ensure that the specific node displacement satisfying displacement limitations, a 
secondary modification is required and is defined as follows:

be simply obtained by multiplying the original member stresses and joint displacements by the value

2.3.2. Minor modification 
 This modification insures that the maximum displacements corresponding to secondary load 
conditions (All load conditions except Lp) of the design results of major modification do not exceed 
the allowable displacement. The essentiality of the minor modification is similar to the major 
modification. The control load condition ( sL ) is firstly arbitrarily from among the secondary load 
conditions. The load condition corresponding to the largest displacement has the highest priority. The 
initial design is then calculated by the following equations: 
iPi AA ,

or

where iPA ,  is the cross-section size of i-th member of the previous step, lPGA ,  is the cross-section 
size of l-th member group of the previous step, and the value of α  is the same as that in the major 
modification. If the maximum displacement of the initial design is smaller than allowable 
displacement, then terminate the minor modification. Otherwise, the initial cross-section sizes are 
modified by following equations:

Notably, the minor modification considers each secondary load condition only once.   
2.3.3. Updating the value of α  
 The value of α  depends on constraint situations and weights of truss structures. Herein, the 
golden section search, a line search technique, is adopted to update the value of α . Assume that the 
desired value of α  is located in the interval [ Lα , Uα ], and two inserted points aα  and bα  can be 
determined by
