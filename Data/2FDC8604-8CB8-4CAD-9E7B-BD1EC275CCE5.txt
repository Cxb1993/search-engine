Abstract 
                                                                          I

We present a new optical system for measuring the principal axis angle and phase retardation 
of optical linear birefringent materials. The measurement system has advantages as a simple optical 
setup, high stability, small size, and portable owing to the configuration and the use of a Zeeman 
laser. Using the amplitudes from two measured signals and a referenced signal, a simple derived 
algorithm can obtain the principal axis angle and phase retardation directly. According to the 
algorithm, the principal axis angle is limited in the range from 00 to 900 and dynamic range of  
phase retardation measurement is extended to be 1800 successfully. According to the experimental 
results, the average absolute errors for the principal axis angle and the phase retardation of 
λ -wave plate with principal axis angle set on 900 are determined to be 1.470 and 2.85 %, 
respectively. The absolute error for the phase retardation is within uncertainty range 5 % more of 
commercial quarter-wave plates [8].

phase retardation dynamic range is determined in a range from 00 to 1800. 
 
3. Methodology 
3.1 Optical configuration 
The configuration of optical setups in the proposed method is shown in Figure 1. A heterodyne 
Zeeman laser that includes two orthogonal linearly polarized waves in different temporal 
frequencies was used as the light source in the configuration. Two orthogonal linearly polarized 
waves, one p polarized and the other s polarized, passed through a Glan-Thompson polarized in 
which the azimuth angle was set as 450. Subsequently, the light beam passes through the first beam 
splitter, resulting in a measurement beam and a reference beam. The reflected beam is polarized 
and detected as the reference signal. The measurement beam transmits through the sample, and the 
second beam splitter. Finally it is polarized through an analyzer and detected by a photodetector, 
respectively, to produce two measured signals. The reference signal and two measured signals are 
digitized and stored, followed by an off-line analysis using dedicated software Matlab for 
extracting the principal axis angle and phase retardation of the optical sample. 
 
3.2 Principle 
According to the Jones matrix formalism, the light vector emerging from the configuration in 
Figure 1 is given by

From equations (2), (5), and (6), an oscilloscope is employed to achieve the ac component of 
the referenced intensity and the two measured output intensities at the beat frequency. Consequently, 
the principal axis angle of the optical sample, α , and its phase retardation, β , can be derived as:

According to Eq. (7), the principal axis angle, α , is determined without ambiguity in the range 
from 00 to 900. The phase retardation, β , is determined in a range from 00 to 1800 following Eq. 
(8). 
 
3.3 Error Analysis 
The measurement errors are induced by elliptical polarization of the incident laser beam, the 
error of rotation and the imperfect polarizer in this setup. The error analysis in elliptical polarization 
of the incident Zeeman laser could be cited [6]. Residual ellipticity determines the amplitude of the 
background signal in the absence of a sample, to bring the background signal to a small value as 
possible a wave plate can be used after laser to compensate for residual ellipticity. If a higher 
extinction ration of a polarizer such as Glan-Thomposon polarizer is used, the error of birefringence 
measurement due to imperfect polarizer can be neglected. The present study restricts its attention to 
the measurement errors induced by the error of rotation angle [7].  
Fig. 2 presents the simulated absolute principal axis angle and phase retardation errors, 
respectively, for the case of a quarter-wave plate sample and the rotation of inclination angle has a 
value of 00, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, and 10. Fig. 2(a) indicates that the maximum absolute principal axis 
angle errors occurs when principal axis angle is equal to 45 0. The values of the absolute error are 
seen to be 0.0, 0.6860, 0.2450, 0.1240, and 0.0600 for the rotation of inclination angle has a value of 
00, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, and 10. Fig. 2(b) indicates that the maximum absolute phase retardation errors 
occurs when principal axis angle is close to 45 0.Moreover, it is noted that when the rotation of 
inclination angle exceeds 0.50, the magnitudes of the non-linearity errors increase. The 
measurement errors approach larger as principal axis angle approaches 45 0. 
 
 
4. Experimental setup and results 
 
4.1 Experimental setup 
In Figure 1, the experimental setup employs a Zeeman laser (Hewlett-Packard Hp 5519A). The 
output power of this laser beam was 1mw, the wavelength of the Zeeman laser was 632.8 nm, and 
the difference frequency of the two orthogonal polarization modes was 2.6 MHz. The optical 
arrangement also includes four Glan-Thompson type polarizers with extinction ratio of 5 x 10-6 and 
three photodetectors (NEW FOCUS Model 1801 DC-version type). Digitization of reference and 
                                                                          4

First of all, the polarization-modulation heterodyne interferometer is developed successfully. 
This optical linear birefringence measurement system can be employed to scan the near-field 
property of materials. Second, after some revision to meet the requirements of journal, this report 
can be utilized to submit to journal. Final, about patent apply, I think that it is necessary to 
investigate the relative research before apply.
