1 Introduction
A wide variety of the problems in discrete optimal control problem can be posed in
the following form.
Determine a pair (x, u) of a path x = (x0, x1, . . . , xN) ∈ X0×X1× · · ·×XN and
a control vector u = (u0, u1, . . . , uN−1) ∈ U0 × U1 × · · · × UN−1 which minimize the
cost
f(x, u, w) =
N−1∑
k=0
hk(xk, uk, wk) + hN(xN) (1)
and which satisfy the state equation
xk+1 = Akxk +Bkuk + Tkwk, k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, (2)
the constraints
uk ∈ Ωk ⊂ Uk, k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, (3)
and the initial condition
x0 ∈ C. (4)
Here
k indexes the discrete time,
N is the horizon or number times control applied,
xk is the state of the system which summarizes past information that is relevant
to future optimization,
uk is the control variable to be selected at time k with the knowledge of the state
xk,
w = (w0, w1, . . . , wN−1) ∈ W0×W1×· · ·× · · ·WN−1 is a random parameter (also
called disturbance or noise),
Ak : Xk → Xk+1; Bk : Uk → Xk+1; Tk : Wk → Xk+1 are linear mappings,
Xk is the finite-dimensional space of state variables at stage k,
Uk is the finite-dimensional space of control variables at stage k,
Wk is the finite-dimensional space of random parameters at stage k,
Ωk is a nonempty set in Uk,
C is a nonempty closed convex subset of X0.
Problems of this type were considered in many papers (see [2], [3] [9], [13], [14],
[15], [16], [17] [18]). A classical example for the problems (1)− (4) is the economic
stabilization problem (see [26] and [30]).

that upper-evaluation on the Fre´chet subdifferential in [6] is also upper-evaluation
on the Mordukhovich subdifferential of the value function V if the solution map S
is V−inner semicontinuous at (w, z). Besides, the Mordukhovich subdifferential of
the value function V at w contains the Fre´chet subdifferential of V at w. So, the
upper-evaluation in this paper is better than the corresponding evaluation in [6].
2 Preliminaries
Let us recall some notions on generalized differentiation which are related to our
problem. The notions and results of generalized differentiation can be found in [4],
[7], [19] and [20]. Let Z be a finite-dimensional space, ϕ : Z → R be an extended
real-valued function and z ∈ Z be such that ϕ(z) is finite. For each ε ≥ 0, the set
∂ˆεϕ(z) :=
{
z∗ ∈ Z| lim inf
z→z
ϕ(z)− ϕ(z)− 〈z∗, z − z〉
‖z − z‖ ≥ −ε
}
is called the ε− Fre´chet subdifferential of ϕ at z. A given vector z∗ ∈ ∂̂εϕ(z) is called
an ε− Fre´chet subgradient of ϕ at z. The set ∂̂ϕ(z) = ∂̂0ϕ(z) is called the Fre´chet
subdifferential of ϕ at z and the set
∂ϕ(z) := lim
Ω
z→z
ε↓0
∂̂εϕ(z) (5)
is called the Mordukhovich subdifferential of ϕ at z. Hence,
z∗ ∈ ∂ϕ(z)⇐⇒ there exist sequences zk ϕ−→ z, εk → 0+ and z∗k ∈ ∂̂εkϕ(zk)
such that z∗k → z∗. If ϕ is lower semicontinuous around z, then we can equivalently
put ε = 0 in (5). Moreover, we have ∂ϕ(z) 6= ∅ for every locally Lipschitzian
function. It is known that the Mordukhovich subdifferential reduces to the classical
Fre´chet derivative for strictly differentiable functions and to subdifferential of convex
analysis for convex functions. The set
∂∞ϕ(z) := lim
Ω
z→z
λ,ε↓0
λ∂̂εϕ(z)
is called the singular subdifferential of ϕ at z. Hence,.
z∗ ∈ ∂∞ϕ(z)⇐⇒ there exist sequences zk ϕ−→ z, εk → 0+, λk → 0+, and z∗k ∈ λk∂̂εkϕ(zk)
such that z∗k → z∗. Let Ω be a nonempty set in Z and z0 ∈ Ω. The set
N̂ε(z0; Ω) :=
{
z∗ ∈ Z| lim sup
z
Ω−→z0
〈z∗, z − z0〉
‖z − z0‖ ≤ ε

Where M∗ and T ∗ are the adjoint operators of M and T , respectively.
We assume further that Ωk are locally closed around uk, for all k = 0, 1, . . . , N−1,
and the following assumption:
(A) For any x∗0 ∈ N(x0;C), and u∗k ∈ N(uk,Ωk), k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, if there exists
z∗ = (z∗1 , z

then x∗0 = 0 and u

We say that the solution map S(w) is V−inner semicontinuous at (w, z) if for
every sequence wk
V−→ w (i.e., V (wk) → V (w)), there is a sequence {zk} with
zk ∈ S(wk) for all k which contains a subsequence converging to z.
We are now ready to state our main result.
Theorem 2.1 Let the solution map S be V− inner semicontinuous at (w, z) ∈ gph,
hN be strictly differentiable at xN and hk be strictly differentiable at (xk, uk, wk) for
k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1. Assume that Ωk are normally regular at uk with intΩk 6=
7
and T ∗ : X → W be adjoint mappings of M and T , respectively. Let function
f : W ×Z → R be lower semicontinuous around (w, z) and Ω be a subset of Z, with
intΩ 6= ∅. For each w ∈ W , we put
H(w) :=
{
z ∈ Z| Mz = Tw}.
Consider the problem of computing the Mordukhovich subdifferential of the value
function
h(w) := inf
z∈H(w)∩Ω
f(w, z). (6)
We denote by Sˆ(w) the solution set of (6) corresponding to parameter w ∈ W .
Assume that the value function h is finite at w, z is a solution of the problem
corresponding to a parameter w, that is z ∈ Ŝ(w) and Ω is locally closed around z.
We now derive a formula for computing the Mordukhovich subdifferential and the
singular subdifferential of the value function to the parametric programming problem
(6). Note that the structure of the formulas for evaluation of the Mordukhovich
subdifferential ∂h(w) and singular subdifferential ∂∞h(w) is different from (although
having some similarities) those established in [6]. The main differences are that we
do not assume ∂+f(w, z) 6= ∅ and instead of using the intersection over (w∗, z∗) ∈
∂+f(w, z) as in [6, Theorem 2.1], we use the union over (w∗, z∗) ∈ ∂f(w, z) or
(w∗, z∗) ∈ ∂∞f(w, z) to evaluate ∂h(w) and ∂∞h(w). On the other hand, we need
an additional assumption h−inner semicontinuity of Sˆ at (w, z).
Theorem 3.1 Suppose the solution map Sˆ is h− inner semicontinuous at (w, z) ∈
gphSˆ, Ω is a normally regular at z and the following conditions:
(i) The following qualification condition is satisfied[
∂∞f(w, z)
] ∩ [{(T ∗x∗,−M∗x∗ − z∗) : x∗ ∈ X, z∗ ∈ N(z; Ω)}] = {0},
(ii) [−N(z,Ω)] ∩M∗(kerT ∗) = {0}.
Then one has
∂h(w) ⊆
⋃
(w∗,z∗)∈∂f(w,z)
⋃
v∗∈N(z;Ω)
[
w∗ + T ∗
(
(M∗)−1(z∗ + v∗)
)]
. (7)
∂∞h(w) ⊆
⋃
(w∗,z∗)∈∂∞f(w,z)
⋃
v∗∈N(z;Ω)
[
w∗ + T ∗

(M∗)−1(z∗ + v∗)
)]
. (8)

for all zk ∈ Sˆ(wk), (w, z) ∈ (wk, zk) + ηkBW×Z ,∀k ∈ N. This give (w∗k, 0) ∈
∂ˆε˜kϑ(wk, zk) with ε˜k = 2εk. Since Sˆ is h− inner semicontinuous at (w, z), we can
select a sequence of zk ∈ Sˆ(wk) converging to z. Observe that ϑ(wk, zk) → ϑ(w, z)
due to h(wk)→ h(w). Hence
∂h(w) ⊂ {w∗ ∈ W : (w∗, 0) ∈ ∂ϑ(w, z)}
=
{
w∗ ∈ W : (w∗, 0) ∈ ∂[f(w, z) + δ((w, z), P ∩Q)](w, z)}.
From the condition (i) and [19, Theorem 3.36], it follows that
∂h(w) ⊂ {w∗ ∈ W : (w∗, 0) ∈ ∂f(w, z) +N((w, z);P ∩Q)}.
By Lemma 3.2, we have
∂h(w) ⊂ {w∗ ∈ W : (w∗, 0) ∈ ∂f(w, z) + {0} ×N(z; Ω) +N((w, z);Q)}
which is equivalent to
∂h(w) ⊂
{
w∗ ∈ W : (w∗, 0) ∈
⋃
(w∗1 ,z
∗
1 )∈∂f(w,z)
⋃
z∗∈N(z;Ω)
[
(w∗1, z
∗
1)+(0, z
∗)+N
(
(w, z);Q
)]}
.
By Lemma 3.1, there exists x∗ ∈ X such that
w∗ − w∗1 = −T ∗(x∗) and − z∗1 − z∗ = M∗(x∗),
for some (w∗1, z
∗
1) ∈ ∂f(w, z) and z∗ ∈ N(z; Ω). Hence
w∗ = w∗1 + T
∗(−x∗) and − x∗ = (M∗)−1(z∗1 + z∗).
Consequently
w∗ ∈ w∗1 + T ∗
[
(M∗)−1(z∗1 + z
∗)
]
,
for some (w∗1, z
∗
1) ∈ ∂f(w, z) and z∗ ∈ N(z; Ω). We obtain the inclusion (7).
To prove the inclusion (8), take any w∗ ∈ ∂∞h(w). Then there exist sequences
wk
h−→ w, εk → 0+, ξk → 0+, and w∗k ∈ ξk∂ˆεkh(wk) such that w∗k → w∗ as k →∞. So
1
ξk
w∗k ∈ ∂ˆεkh(wk), ∀k ∈ N. Hence, there is a sequence ηk ↓ 0 such that
〈 1
ξk
w∗k, w − wk〉 ≤ h(w)− h(wk) + 2εk ‖ w − wk ‖,∀w ∈ wk + ηkBW .
So,
〈 1
ξk
w∗k, w − wk〉+ 〈0, z − zk〉 ≤ ϑ(w, z)− ϑ(wk, zk) + 2εk(‖ w − wk ‖ + ‖ z − zk ‖),
11
Putting γˆ = min{γ
2
, γ
2l
}, we get from the above inequality that
〈(w∗ −∇wf(w, z),−∇zf(w, z)), (wk − w, zk − z)〉
> 0(||zk − z||+ ||wk − w||) + γˆ(||zk − z||+ ||wk − w||).
Consequently,
lim sup
(w,z)
P∩Q−−−→(w,z)
〈(
w∗ −∇wf(w, z),−∇zf(w, z)
)
, (w − w, z − z)〉
||z − z||+ ||w − w|| > γˆ,
which means that(
w∗ −∇wf(w, z),−∇zf(w, z)
)
/∈ N((w, z);P ∩Q).
By Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, we have(
w∗ −∇wf(w, z),−∇zf(w, z)− z∗
)
/∈ N((w, z);Q) = {(−T ∗x∗,M∗x∗)|x∗ ∈ X},
(12)
for all z∗ ∈ N(z; Ω). From (10), we can find a vector z∗ ∈ N(z; Ω) such that
w∗ −∇wf(w, z) ∈ T ∗
(
(M∗)−1(∇zf(w, z) + z∗)
)
from which it follows that there exists x∗ ∈ (M∗)−1(∇zf(w, z) + z∗) such that
w∗ −∇wf(w, z) = T ∗(x∗).
Hence
w∗ −∇wf(w, z) = −T ∗(−x∗) and −∇zf(w, z)− z∗ = M∗(−x∗).
Consequently,(
w∗ −∇wf(w, z),−∇zf(w, z)− z∗
) ∈ N((w, z);Q) = {(−T ∗v∗,M∗v∗)|v∗ ∈ X},
which contradicts (12). Hence, the second assertion is valid and the proof of the
theorem is complete. 
Let us give some illustrative examples for Theorem 3.1.
Example 3.1 Let Z = R3,W = R2,Ω = (−∞, 1]× (−∞, 1]× R,
f(w, z) =
√
2(z21 + z
2
2)− w31 + w32
13
Hence
(M∗)−1(1 + u∗1, 1 + u
∗
2, 0) =
{{
(1 + u∗1, 0)
}
if u∗1 = u
∗
2
∅ otherwise,
and
T ∗
(
(M∗)−1(1 + u∗1, 1 + u
∗
2, 0)
)
=
{{
(2 + 2u∗1, 0)
}
if u∗1 = u
∗
2
∅ otherwise.
Combining this with (13), we get
∂h(w) = [−1,+∞)× {0}.
By using similar arguments, we also have
∂∞h(w) ⊂ [0,+∞)× {0}.
The next example demonstrates that the inclusion (7) of the Theorem 3.1 may
hold as equality with no strict differentiability assumption on the objective function
f as in (9).
Example 3.2 Let Z = R3,W = R2,Ω = [0,+∞)× [0,+∞)× R,
f(w, z) =
√
z31 + 3|w1|z2 − w31 − |w2|,
and H(w) =
{
(z1, z2, z3) ∈ R3 : z1 + z2 = 2w1, z3 = 0
}
. Assume that w = (1, 0).
Then the assumptions in Theorem 3.1 are satisfied and ∂h(w) =
{
(−3
4
,−1); (−3
4
, 1)
}
.
Besides, ∂ˆh(w) = ∅.
Indeed, for w = (1, 0), we have
h(w) = inf
(z1,z2,z3)∈H(w)∩Ω
{√
z31 + 3z2 − 1
}
,
where H(w) =
{
(z1, z2, z3) ∈ R3 : z1 + z2 = 2, z3 = 0
}
. It is easy to check that
z = (1, 1, 0) is the unique solution of the problem corresponding to w and h(w) = 1.
Since z ∈ intΩ, the condition (ii) of Theorem 3.1 is satisfied.
By computing directly, we see that
Sˆ(w) =
{(√
w1, 2w1 −√w1, 0
)}
if w1 ≥ 1
4
where w = (w1, w2). Thus, the solution map Sˆ : [
1
4
,+∞) × R ⇒ R3 is h− inner
simicontinuous at (w, z). It is easy to check that f is locally Lipschitzian around
15
where w = (w1, w2). Thus, the solution map Sˆ : R2 ⇒ R3 is h− inner simicontinuous
at (w, z). But Sˆ has no locally upper Lipschitzian selection at (w, z). It is easy to
check that f is locally Lipschitzian around (w, z). By [19, Corollary 1.81], we have
∂∞f(w, z) = {0}. So, condition (i) of Theorem 3.1 is satisfied. Hence, (7) becomes
∂h(w) ⊂ [Owf(z, w) + T ∗((M∗)−1(Ozf(z, w)))]
⊂ [(0, 0) + T ∗((M∗)−1(0, 0, 0))]. (15)
Note that
M∗ =
0 01 0
0 1
 and T ∗ = [0 0
0 0
]
.
So, we get ∂h(w) ⊂ {(0, 0)}. By computing directly, we see that
h(w) =
{
w21 if w1 ≤ 0
0 if w1 > 0,
Hence, we have ∂h(w) = {(0, 0)}.
4 Proof of the Main Result
Since f(x, u, w) is strictly differentiable at (x, u, w), we get f(x, u, w) is locally Lip-
schitzian around (x, u, w) (see [19, page 19]). By [19, Corollary 1.81], we have
∂∞f(x, u, w) = {0}. So qualification condition (i) of Theorem 3.1 is satisfied.
We will prove that condition (ii) of Theorem 3.1 is also satisfied. Take any z˜∗ ∈
N(z;K) = N(x0;C) × {0} × N(u; Ω) and z˜∗ ∈ −M∗(kerT ∗), then we can find
x˜∗0 ∈ N(x0;C), u˜∗ = (u˜∗0, u˜∗1, . . . , u˜∗N−1) with u˜∗k ∈ N(uk; Ωk) (k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1)
such that z˜∗ = (x˜∗0, 0, u˜
∗) and (x∗1, x
∗
2, . . . , x
∗
N) ∈ X1 × X2 × · · ·XN such that
T ∗(x∗1, x
∗
2, . . . , x
∗
N) = 0, −M∗(x∗1, x∗2, . . . , x∗N) = (x˜∗0, 0, u˜∗). So
T ∗kx

k+1 = 0 for k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1,
A∗0x

B∗kx
∗
k+1 = u˜
∗
k for k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1.
By assumption (A), we have x˜∗0 = 0 and u˜
∗
k = 0 for k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1. Hence,
[−N(z,K)] ∩M∗(kerT ∗) = {0}. According to Theorem 3.1, it follows that if w∗ ∈
∂V (w), then there exist a vector z∗ ∈ N(z;K) and y∗ = (y∗1, y∗2, . . . , y∗N) ∈ X˜ such
that
w∗ = Owf(z, w) + T ∗y∗ and Ozf(z, w) + z∗ = M∗y∗. (16)

Also, (18) implies (∂hk
∂uk
)(xk, uk, wk) = −u∗k − B∗ky∗k+1, for k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1. Thus,
the first assertion of Theorem 2.1 is valid.
If the solution map S has an upper Lipschitzian selection at (w, x, u), then it
is also a sufficient condition for w∗ ∈ ∂V (w) because of the second assertion of
Theorem 3.1. The proof of the theorem is complete. 
Example 4.1 We will illustrate the obtained result by a concrete problem

Let w = (w0, w1, w2) = (0, 0, 0) and w
∗ ∈ ∂V (w). Then one has w∗ = (0,−1,−1).
Indeed, when w = (0, 0, 0), the problem becomes

We have Oh3(x3) = 0, ∂hk∂xk (xk, uk, wk) = 0,

∂h0
∂w0
(x0, u0, w0) = 0,
∂hk
∂wk
(xk, uk, wk) = −1, for k = 1, 2. For the problem (Pw), one
have C = (−∞, 1],Ωk = R (k = 0, 1, 2); M : R7 → R3 and T : R3 → R3 are defined,

1 − A∗1z∗2 = 0, z∗2 − A∗2z∗3 = 0 and x∗0 = A∗0z∗1 .
We have z∗1 = z
∗
2 = z
∗
3 = 0 and x

0 = 0. Hence, condition (A) is fulfilled. By Theorem
2.1, there exist y∗1, y

Hence, y∗1 = y

3 = 0 and w

2 = −1. Thus, ∂V (w) ⊂
{

By the last assertion of Theorem 2.1, we have ∂V (w) =
{
(0,−1,−1)}.
