the power supply noise in the core, but also can consider the package designs, and 
stacking IC designs. Since stacking IC is promising to the development of a 
high-performance IC, here we propose a partition approach to minimizing the 3D-vias 
and balancing the I/O number for each tier in stacking IC. Finally, we perform 
floorplanning to show the importance of the aspect-ratio factor in stacking IC. 
 
三、研究計畫之背景及目的 
 
In [41], the authors directly utilized traditional 2-D tools to design a stacking IC. 
This method cannot be accepted in the modern design because the vertical factors are 
ignored in traditional 2-D tools. [42] proposed a design flow of stacking IC. The role 
of EDA tools in stacking IC is described in [43] and [44]. Comparing stacking ICs 
with 2-D ICs, front-end design flows are the same and the physical design flow 
should be reformed ([5] and [45]). In the stacking IC, physical design methodologies 
can be classified into two categories: innovation and improving existing approaches. 
The former denotes that the problem does not exist in the 2-D design. The popular 
issues include 3D-Via placement and thermal via placemen. The latter one denotes 
that issues come up at the 2-D design and the difficulty is increased in stacking ICs. 
The famous examples include area-driven floorplan and noise-driven routing issues. 
Wafer stacking and device stacking ICs use the vertical vehicle (Through Silicon 
Via (TSV) or 3D-Via) for connecting different tiers, and the locations of these vertical 
vehicles are set over the die. The tier denotes the stacked number of wafers in the chip. 
Because the resistance of the vertical vehicle is more than the traditional via, the 
performance and power delivery attenuate when the data and power are delivered 
from the bottom tier to the top tier. In our previous work [46], we propose a stacking 
IC architecture to improve these problems. The defect of that architecture is that

 This work proposes a practical design flow in stacking ICs. The vertical 
factor can be divided into several 2-D problems to simplify the complexity 
of the stacking IC design. 
 We have presented a system partition method to balance the area and 
minimize the 3D-via number. The area and the yield can be improved 
simultaneously. 
 We show that the aspect ratio of floorplanning is an important factor when 
we want to obtain a better area result in stacking IC. 
四、研究方法 
 1. Problem Formulation 
In alternative stacking IC, the area and the 3D-Via number increase when I/Os 
and modules are placed at the unsuitable locations. The goal of our system partition is 
to plan I/Os and modules into suitable tiers and to balance each tier area. The problem 
is formulated as follows: 
Given a set of modules, M1, M2, ..., Mx, the number of tiers, T, a set of I/Os, IO1, 
IO2, ..., IOy, and the connection information of each net, N1, N2,..., Nz, find a solution 
such that all modules and all I/Os are assigned to suitable tiers to obtain the minimal 
3D-Via number. At the same time, the I/O number and area for each tier must be 
balanced. 
 2. I/Os and Modules Planning with Minimal 3D-Via Number in 
Alternative Stacking ICs 
In this report, we develop a two-step methodology to plan modules and I/Os at 
the system partition. We firstly use the global planning method to plan modules and 
I/Os. This method balances the I/O number and the area for all tiers, and reduces the 
3D-Via number. We then use a Congestion-driven Planning and Iterative Refinement 
(CPIR) method to plan the I/Os into the suitable tier to minimize the 3D-Via number.

I/Os to construct the equivalent graph, as Figure 3. (B) illustrates. We then use the 
F-M algorithm [51] to plan modules into each tier. The module area balance factor for 
all tiers and 3D-Via number is considered into our FM algorithm. After the tier of all 
modules is obtained, we use Rule 1 to plan the I/O location. 
 
Figure 3. The connection graph of the circuit 
After global planning, final module locations and initial I/O locations can be 
obtained. Because Rule 1 is a simply assigned method for I/Os, we propose another 
method, Congestion-driven Planning and Iterative Refinement (CPIR), to optimize 
I/O locations and to minimize the 3D-Via number. 
2.2 I/O Allocation by Congestion-driven Planning and Iterative Refinement 
Here we propose the Congestion-driven Planning and Iterative Refinement (CPIR) 
method to improve the previous result and minimize the 3D-Via number, as illustrated 
in Figure 4. In CPIR, we firstly build one connected graph (line 1), and then sort the 
I/Os priority (line 2). The I/Os priority is inversely proportional to the connected tier 
number. In previous section, we explain the relation between the 3D-Via number, I/O 
and module. If the I/O and the connected module are planned at the same tier, we do 
not need to spend extra 3D-Via to build the interconnection and the cost of 3D-Via is 
zero. The zero cost candidates are less when I/O has less connected tier number. 
8 
 
 
Figure 4. The pseudo code of CPIR. 
An example can help to explain CPIR. In this example, the tier number is set as 
three, the module number is set as eight and the I/O number is six, NO.1, NO.2, ..., 
NO.6. Our goal is to equally place all I/Os into three tiers. The optimal number of 
I/Os for each tier is two. We firstly build the relation graph as shown in Figure 5(A). 
Then, according to the number of the connection tier, the I/O priority is decided, as 
shown in Figure 5.(B). If the count of the connected tier of I/Os is small, the higher 
priority would be obtained. Because NO.2 and NO.6 have only one connected tier, we 
assign NO.2 and NO.6 to Tier 1, as shown in Figure 5.(C). Now, two I/O pins are 
assigned to Tier 1. According to the relation graph, NO.3 could be assigned to Tier 1 
or Tier 2. If NO.3 is assigned to Tier 1, the I/O number is bigger than the optimal 
number. Therefore, we assign NO.3 into Tier 2. NO.1 could be assigned into Tier 2 or 
Tier 3. Because the space of Tier 3 is more than Tier 2, NO.1 is assigned to Tier 3. 
The illustration of the assigned result is shown in Figure 5.(D). NO.5 could be

 3. Experimental Results 
The proposed modules and I/Os planning method and floorplanner have been 
 
Figure 6. The detailed description of the I/O Planning Method. 
implemented using C++ language on an Intel Pentium 4 2.4GHz machine with 1G 
memory. Five GSRC benchmark circuits, n30, n50, n100, n200 and n300 are used to 
prove the efficiency of the proposed methodology. Since there is no literature on the 
I/O planning method in the floorplan level for the stacking chip design, we compared 
our approach with a greedy method. The greedy method only considers the I/O 
balance factor, and the 3D-Via number are ignored. The greedy method is explained 
as follows. The module and the connected I/Os are planned at the same tier. If the real 
I/O number is more than the ideal I/O number, these redundant I/Os are moved to the 
location of the second candidate. The second candidate location is the max(available 
I/O space of x), where 1 ≤x≤T, T is the tier number. 
Table 1 compares the total 3D-Via number. The first row denotes the number of 
tiers, and the last row denotes the average result for all benchmarks. The Greedy

 tier_areai = Li × Wi  …………………………………………………………..(4.3) 
where Module_areai denotes the total module area at Tier i, Li denotes the longest 
length at Tier i, and Wi denotes the longest width at Tier i. The computation of empty 
space ratio for total area (ET) is shown as follows : 
 ET = ∑(empty _space i )EQ (1) , 1 ≤ i ≤ T 
 empty_spacei = L × W − ∑Module_areai 
 L = max⁡(Tier_Lengthi , 1 ≤ i ≤ T) 
 W = max⁡(Tier_Widthi , 1 ≤ i ≤ T) …………………………………….........(4.4) 
In Figure 7, the empty space ratio of the aspect-ratio-driven floorplan is larger 
than that of the area-driven floorplan when we respectively compare the area for each 
tier. The aspect-ratio-driven floorplan has better results when compared to the final 
area and the empty space ratio for the total area. The results prove that the aspect ratio 
is an important factor in alternative stacking ICs.
