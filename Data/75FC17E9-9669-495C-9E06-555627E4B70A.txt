Abstract 
In the recent years, there has 
been increasing interest in the 
stability analysis and switching 
control design for switched systems. 
The motivation for studying such an 
issue comes partly from the fact that 
switched systems have numerous 
applications in control of many 
systems such as mechanical systems, 
power systems, aircraft, process 
control, traffic control, intelligent 
control and variable structure 
control. In addition, there is a large 
class of nonlinear systems which can 
be stabilized by switching control 
schemes, but not able to be stabilized 
by any continuous static state 
feedback control. Thus, it is 
important to investigate the issues 
regarding the stability and the 
related performances analysis of the 
switched systems. In this project, we 
have studied the following subjects:  
z Extend the existence of stabilizing 
switching rule among N unstable 
linear systems from having the 
系統(nonholonomic systems)或稱為無漂
流項系統(driftless systems)也已被證
實無法利用單一個連續靜態回授的控制律
來達成穩定的目的。因此切換式控制策略
便成為一個具體可行且有效的控制方法。
因而切換式系統的相關研究議題確實有其
重要性及必要性。基於上述理由，本計畫
的研究目的在於研發新一代切換式系統的
穩定性分析理論及其性能分析技術，並將
此研發技術應用到實際的切換式系統以增
廣切換式控制技術的適用性及其效率。同

dependent stabilizing switching rule σ(x) to achieve the ob-
jective x(t) → 0 as t →∞.
To achieve the main goals as described above, we need
the following two results from Calculus:
Lemma 1 : Let φ(t) : IR → IR be an analytic function at
t = t0 and φ(i)(t0) = 0 for all positive integers i. Then
there exists a δ > 0 such that φ(t) ≡ φ(t0) for all t ∈
(t0 − δ, t0 + δ).
Lemma 2 : Let φ(t) : IR → IR be a differentiable function
with φ˙(t0) < 0. Then there exists a δ > 0 such that φ(t) <
φ(t0) for all t ∈ (t0, t0 + δ) and φ(t) > φ(t0) for all t ∈
(t0 − δ, t0).
It should be noted that, φ˙(t0) < 0 does not imply that
φ is a strictly decreasing function over a neighborhood
of t0. In this paper we adopt the notation Li+1f V (x) =
Lf (LifV (x)), where LfV (x) = V (x) · f(x) denotes the
Lie derivative of V along the vector field f , and V (x) is
the gradient vector of V . Clearly, the ith-order time deriva-
tive of V along the trajectory of x˙(t) = f(x(t)) has the
expression V (i)(x(t)) := d
i
dti V (x(t)) = L
i
fV (x(t)).
3. Main Results
From Lemma 2, we have the next result, which describes
the decreasing condition of a scalar function along a trajec-
tory using the information of high-order derivatives at only
one point:
Lemma 3 : Let V : IRn → IR be a positive defninte func-
tion (pdf) and x(t) be the solution of x˙(t) = f(x(t)). Sup-
pose that all the nth-order partial derivatives of V along f
exist, n > 1, and
V (n)(x(t0)) < 0 and V (i)(x(t0)) = 0 (3)
for all i = 1, · · · , n. Then there exists a δ > 0 such that
V˙ (x(t)) < 0 for all t ∈ (t0, t0 + δ).
Proof : Since V (n)(x(t0)) < 0 and V (n−1)(x(t0)) =
0, from Lemma 2 we have V (n−1)(x(t)) < 0 for some
t ∈ (t0, t0 + δ) and δ > 0. By the Mean Value Theorem,
V (n−2)(x(t)) is a strictly decreasing function on (t0, t0+δ).
Since V (n−2)(x(t0)) = 0, it follows that V (n−2)(x(t)) < 0
for all t ∈ (t0, t0 + δ). Using the same argument, we have
V (n−3)(x(t)) < 0 for all t ∈ (t0, t0 + δ), and finally
V˙ (x(t)) < 0 for all t ∈ (t0, t0 + δ). This completes the
proof.
To present the main result for stabilizability of the
switched system (2), we introduce the two sets M and
I(x, k) as described by (4) and (5) below:
M := {x = 0 | min
1≤i≤N
LfiV (x) = 0}, (4)
and ∀x ∈ M ,
I(x, k) := {i | LjfiV (x) = 0, j = 1, · · · , k}. (5)
Clearly, M denotes the set of nonzero states where the min-
imum of the first-order derivative V˙ along every trajectory
of the subsystems of (1) is zero, and, for each x ∈ M ,
I(x, k) collects those indices of subsystems which have
the property V (j) = 0 there for all j = 1, · · · , k. Note
that, I(x, k2) ⊆ I(x, k1) if k1 < k2. This implies that
I(x, k + 1) is obtained from I(x, k) by taking those index
i away if Lk+1fi V (x) = 0. We now present the main result.
Theorem 1 : Suppose that V (x) is a pdf having all con-
tinuous nth-order partial derivatives, and the set Ωr :=
{x|V (x) < r} is a bounded set for some r > 0. Then there
exists a stabilizing switching rule σ(x) among the subsys-
tems of (1) if either of the following two conditions holds:
(i) min
1≤i≤N
{LfiV (x)} < 0 for all nonzero x ∈ Ωr;
(ii) min
1≤i≤N
{LfiV (x)} ≤ 0 for all x ∈ Ωr, and
∀x ∈ M ∩ Ωr, ∃ an integer l > 1 such that
min
i∈I(x,l−1)
{
LlfiV (x)
}
< 0, but
min
i∈I(x,l−1)
{
LkfiV (x)
}
= 0 for all k < l.
Moreover, an associated state-dependent stabilizing switch-
ing rule has the form
σ(x) :=
{
arg min1≤i≤N{LfiV (x)} if x ∈ M ∩ Ωr
arg mini∈I(x,l−1){LlfiV (x)} if x ∈ M ∩ Ωr.
(6)
Proof : Clearly, if Condition (i) holds, then with the
switching rule (6) we have V˙ < 0 along the trajectory of
System (2). It follows that x(t) → 0 as t → ∞. On
the other hand, suppose that Condition (ii) holds. Then
by LaSalle’s Invariant Set Theorem we only need to show
that the only invariant subset of (M ∪ {0}) ∩ Ωr is {0} to
achieve the stabilization task. To show this, we let x0 ∈
M ∩Ωr and let x(t) be the solution trajectory of x˙ = fj(x)
with x(t0) = x0 and j =arg mini∈I(x0,l−1){LlfiV (x0)}.
Then V (l)(x(t0)) := LlfjV (x(t0)) < 0 by assumption.
This fact together with the assumption V (k)(x(t0)) :=
LkfjV (x(t0)) = 0 for all k < l then implies, by Lemma 3,
that V˙ (x(t)) < 0 for some t ∈ (t0, t0 + δ), δ > 0. That is,
the state of System (2) will move out from the set M ∩ Ωr,
and thus the only invariant subset of (M ∪ {0})∩Ωr is the
origin itself. This completes the proof.
The set Ωr stated in Theorem 1 is an estimation of the
domain of attraction of System (2) using the stabilizing
switching rule (6). If the pdf V (x) has the radially un-
bounded property, that is, V (x) → ∞ as ||x|| → ∞, then
the result of Theorem 1 holds globally, as described below:

Abstract
This study investigates the existence of stabilizing
switching rules among a class of unstable nonlinear sys-
tems. A high-order checking condition and an associated
stabilizing switching rule are presented to implement the
stabilizability of the switched systems. An illustrative exam-
ple is also given to demonstrate the usage and the benefits
of the proposed scheme.

1. Introduction
The study of stability and stabilizability of switched sys-
tems has recently attracted considerable attention (see e.g.,
[1], [3]-[5], [6]-[17] and the references therein). A switched
system is known as a hybrid dynamical system comprising
a finite number of subsystems and a logic rule that conducts
the switching among them. This kind of system arises from
many practical applications such as adaptive control, intel-
ligent control, variable structure control, and the control of
many mechanical systems [3], [6]-[9], [14], [16]. The key
motivations for having “multiple modalities” or “variable
structures” during the control period are 1) to improve the
transient response of an adaptive system [11] and 2) the
existence of systems (such as nonholonomic systems) that
cannot be asymptotically stabilizable by a single continuous
static state feedback control [2] [5], which make switching
control technique especially useful.
The issues regarding stability and stabilizability of
switched systems can be roughly characterized into two cat-
egories [8], [6]. One is the stability analysis of switched
systems under given switching signals, including arbitrary
or slow switching [10], [12], [15]; the other is the synthesis
of stabilizing switching signals for a given collection of dy-
namical systems [1], [13], [17]. In this paper, we consider
only the issue of the second category with all subsystems
being unstable. One of the sufficient conditions for the ex-
istence of stabilizing switching rules among unstable linear
systems is that the subsystems have a stable convex com-
bination [13], [17]. This condition becomes necessary and
sufficient for quadratic stabilizability if the switched system
contains only two linear subsystems [4]. Recently, this suf-
ficient condition of stable convex combination for stabiliz-
ability of switched linear systems was extended to a neutral
stable convex combination of only two subsystems [1]. In
this paper, a high-order checking condition and the associ-
ated stabilizing switching rule are presented to stabilize a
class of switched nonlinear systems.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
the problem and the main goals of the paper. The main re-
sults regarding the existence conditions and the associated
stabilizing switching rules are presented in Section 3. Sec-
tion 4 gives two illustrative examples to demonstrate the us-
age and benefits of the proposed scheme. Finally, Section 5
summarizes the results.
2. Problem Statement
In this paper we consider a set of nonlinear systems
x˙(t) = fi(x(t)), i = 1, · · · , N (1)
where fi(x), i = 1, · · · , N, are smooth functions. For the
study of interest, we assume that fi(0) = 0 for each i, and
that the origin is not an asymptotically stable equilibrium
point for each subsystem of (1). The control objective is to
switch among the N systems to asymptotically stabilize the
state trajectory of
x˙(t) = fσ(x)(x(t)) (2)
by proper choice of a state-dependent switching rule defined
by σ(x) : IRn → {1, · · · ,N } which is piecewise constant
over each finite time interval. Thus, the main goals of this
paper are to present conditions for the existence of stabi-
lizing switching rules, and to organize an associated state-

Corollary 1 : Suppose that V (x) is a radially unbounded
pdf having all the nth-order partial derivatives. Then there
exists a stabilizing switching rule σ(x) among the subsys-
tems of (1) if either Condition (i) or Condition (ii) of Theo-
rem 1 holds for all nonzero x.
We now consider an interesting special case of which
V (x) is a quadratic function and each subsystem of (1) is
linear. That is, V (x) = xTPx and fi(x) = Aix, where P
is a symmetric positive definite matrix, denoted by P > 0
hereafter. The assumption that none of the subsystems of
(1) has an asymptotically stable equilibrium point at the ori-
gin then implies that none of Ai, i = 1, · · · , N , is a Hurwitz
matrix. The two sets in (4) and (5) for this case become
M = {x = 0 | min
1≤i≤N
xTPAix = 0}, (7)
and
I(x, k) =

⎞
⎠x = 0,
1 ≤ m ≤ k
}
for each x ∈ M (8)
where Cmj := m!j!(m−j)! . We have the next result, which is a
direct consequence of Theorem 1.
Corollary 2 : There exists a stabilizing switching rule σ(x)
among systems {A1, · · · , AN} if there exists a matrix P >
0 such that either of the following two conditions holds:
(i) min
1≤i≤N
{xTPAix} < 0 for all x = 0;
(ii) min
1≤i≤N
{xTPAix} ≤ 0 for all x, and ∀x ∈ M,
∃ an integer l > 0 such that

An associated stabilizing switching rule has the following
form: σ(x) =argmin1≤i≤N{xTPAix} if x ∈ M , and
σ(x) =argmini∈I(x,l−1)
{
xT
(∑l
j=0 C

}
if x ∈ M.
If l given by Corollary 2 equals 2, we have the second
order checking condition as below:
Corollary 3 : There exists a stabilizing switching rule σ(x)
among systems {A1, · · · , AN} if there exists a matrix P >
0 such that either of the following two conditions holds:
(i) min
1≤i≤N
{xTPAix} < 0 for all x = 0;
(ii) min
1≤i≤N
{xTPAix} ≤ 0 for all x, and ∀x ∈ M ,
min
i∈I(x,1)
{xT (ATi PAi + PA2i )x} < 0.
A key to performing the checking conditions stated in
Theorem 1 and Corollaries 1-3 is to search for a pdf V (x),
or a matrix P > 0 in the linear case. A candidate for the
existence of such P is given from Condition (9) below [6,
13, 17]:
∃ αi > 0 and
N∑
i=1
αi = 1 such that Aeq :=
N∑
i=1
αiAi
is a Hurwitz matrix. (9)
Indeed, it is easy to verify that Condition (9) leads to
min1≤i≤N{xTPAix} < 0 for all x = 0, where P is the
unique solution of the Lyapunov equation ATeqP + PAeq +
Q = 0 for any Q > 0. Thus, a stabilizing switching rule is
guaranteed to exist if Condition (9) holds, as stated below:
Corollary 4 : Suppose that Condition (9) holds. Then
there exists a stabilizing switching rule σ(x) among sys-
tems {A1, · · · , AN}.

Clearly, all the trajectories of the two systems are el-
liptical limit cycles. A simple calculation shows that
min1≤i≤2{xTPAix} = min{x1x2,−x1x2} ≤ 0 for all
x, M = {x = 0|xTPA1x = xTPA2x = 0} = {x =
0|x1x2 = 0} and I(x, 1) = {1, 2} for all x ∈ M . Since
mini∈I(x,1){xT (ATi PAi + PA2i )x} = minx∈M{2x21 −
x22,−x21 + 2x22} < 0 for all x ∈ M . The existence of a
stabilizing switching rule is also guaranteed by Corollary 3.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented existence conditions
and the associated stabilizing switching rules to implement
the stabilizability of a class of switched nonlinear systems.
To demonstrate the usage and the benefits of the proposed
scheme, an example of stabilizable switched linear systems
is also presented.
