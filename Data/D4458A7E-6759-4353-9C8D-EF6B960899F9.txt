Abstract-The technology of autonomous mono-wheeled vehicle (hereafter called monowheeler) comprises   
conceptualization, design, simulation, implementation and suspension test. A platform, mounted on the 
moving wheel axle, is stabilized for leveling by longitudinal (wheel speed and pitch) control and lateral (roll 
and heading) control. Two significant approaches, i.e. LQR bank-to-turn and neural identification for 
moment of inertia by linear predictor, are introduced and developed via simulation and suspension test 
especially for heading control of focus. All the mathematics works employee Matlab, simulink, control tool 
box and neural network tool box.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
    The thought of monowheeler, an unmanned autopilot mono-wheeled vehicle, is inspired by the 
traded commodity of “Segway bywheeled scooter” since 2004 as shown in Fig.1. If two wheels of 
Segway scooter are able to be replaced by a mono-wheel, then it will be innovative and energy-cost 
effective. The goal of the research is thus defined as “Building an autonomous monowheeler 
prototyping with capability of trajectory following at speed of 20km/hr ”. A breakdown of scope of 
works to realize the goal is given as follows: 
      Phase I: conceptualization; Phase II: control design; Phase III: simulation; 
      Phase IV: implementation; Phase V: suspension test; Phase VI: identification. 
    As to the conceptualization in phase I, a conceptual configuration is shown in Fig.2. In order to 
measure and control the attitude (roll, pitch and heading) of the wheel, a platform is mounted onto the 
wheel axle (i.e. pitch axis) as if it were a non-inverted pendulum relative to the wheel. However the 
attitude of roll and heading of platform is the same as that of the wheel. The platform offers a facility 
for measurement and control of wheel speed and platform attitude (roll, pitch and heading).

where Q and R  are weighting matrix with positive definite 0>Q and 0>R , while )(tu is the 
control effort or currents of motors in physical sense. Plant motor control includes three motors and 
three controllers to drive wheel motor, pitch motor and roll motor.  
    As to the control design in phase II, the platform mounted onto the wheel axle has to be stabilized 
autonomously for leveling in terms of static balancing by weighting assignment or dynamic balancing 
by feedback loop control. Since leveling control expects platform XY plane to lie on the level, 
longitudinal (wheel speed and pitch) control and lateral (roll and heading) control are thus introduced. 
Longitudinal control deals with a problem of non-inverted pendulum. Lateral control applies 
bank-to-turn algorithm. Preceding researches on vehicle control technology are classified into three 
categories, i.e. 1) adaptive control for active suspensions [1]- [9], 2) vehicle dynamics [10]-[11], 3) 
vehicle control [12]-[17].  
II.  PROTOTYPING DESIGN 
The prototype of monowheeler is basically composed of a wheel, a platform and a control unit to 
meet the goals of a monowheeler performance, i.e. wheel speed 20km/hr and platform tilt less than 1o  
as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b).

A. Hardware Assignment 
  The wheel is made of wheel tire (Michelin), wheel motor (GIGA105-8) and wheel axle bearing. 
The platform has suspension frames, aluminum platform (Alloy 6061), pitch ball screw 
(PMI-FSVW-25-10), roll ball screw (PMI-FSVW-25-10) and battery (12V). The control unit consists 
in wheel control components (motor, servo amplifier, variable reluctance meter, F/V counter), pitch 
                                 0=g -Nmp                                    (14)

Applying roll torque for bank-to-turn (i.e. roll-induced-heading), it follows  
            
                                          Fig. 7. Bank-to-turn  
The homogeneous part of Eq. (32) reveals that the system is critical stable. Therefore it is necessary to 
add on a rate feedback and/or a position feedback together so as to obtain a stable eigen structure for 
the coupling loop of bank-to-turn heading control.

V. IDENTIFICATION OF MOMENT OF INERTIA BY SUSPENSION TEST  
    As understanding, LQR design is chosen on the basis of exact plant parameters. Actually moment 
of inertia xxI  and yyI  are hand-calculated in Eq. (56) for LQR design. It means that both xxI  and 
yyI  are not quite accurate and have to be identified. Suspension test is an approach employed hereafter 
to identify xxI  and yyI  in terms of linear predictor.  
A.   Arrangement for Suspension Test  
Facility :  
    The facility for suspension test is set up as shown in Fig. 13(a)∼(b). The purpose of suspension 
test is to measure signals from IMU as inputs to the linear predictor and to obtain xxI  and yyI from 
outputs of the linear predictor.

Scheme:  
Steps of measurement in suspension test are given as follows. Prior to the measurement, balancing 
and leveling should be finished by referring to data of x and y- accelerometers.

C.   Identification from measurement and Widrow-Hoff algorithm  
The structure of linear predictor in Fig. 15(a) uses Widrow-Hoff learning algorithm as the main 
body, measurements (heading rate, roll rate and torque) after filtering as inputs and identified moment 
of inertia xxI  and yyI  (W1 and W2 ) as outputs. Fig. 15(a) is a detailed loop for the linear predictor as 
shown in Fig. 14 (b). Fig. 15(b) is the suspension test loop with a lead-lag controller. Plot of heading 
and roll is complied with LQR design.

Abstract-An unmanned monowheeled vehicle as called mono-
wheeler is conceptualized, designed, simulated and implemented 
to achieve its autopilot capabilities of programmed-trajectory 
following and mounted-platform attitude balancing by LQR 
approach.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
    The thought of an unmanned autopilot monowheeled 
vehicles (hereafter called “momowheeler”) is inspired by the 
traded commodity of “Segway bywheeled scooter” since 
2004 as shown in Fig.1. For energy saving, two wheels of 
Segway bywheeled scooter might be replaced by a solo wheel 
as studied in this paper. The goal of the research is to develop 
a platform-mounted monowheeler so that it might achieve 
autopilot capabilities of programmed-trajectory following and 
mounted-platform attitude balancing. Preceding researches on 
vehicle control technology are classified to 3 categories, i.e. 1) 
adaptive control for active suspensions  [1]- [9], 2) vehicle 
dynamics [10]-[11], 3) vehicle control  [12]-[17].  
     The whole scope of research work is composed of five 
phases: 
      Phase I: Conceptual configuration.  
      Phase II: Prototyping design.    
      Phase III: Autopilot control. 
      Phase IV: Simulation. 
      Phase V: Testing. 
    As to the phase I, a conceptual configuration is shown in 
Fig.2. A platform is mounted onto the wheel axle (i.e. pitch 
axis) as if it were a non-inverted pendulum. In other words, 
the roll and heading of platform attitude is the same as that of 
the wheel. There are four subsystems, i.e. programmed 
trajectory, autopilot, inertia navigator and plant motor control 
as given in Fig. 3.  
     Programmed trajectory presets wheel position )(tR  
together with platform attitude )(tθ  as  
           [ ] [ ]TT  )( )(  )( )( )(   )( tttytxtt RP θθ=θR              (1) 
with pitch  )(tPθ and roll )( tRθ . Platform attitude of heading 
)(tHθ  is not included in Eq. (1) since )(tHθ  is dependent and 
can be derived from

Note that Eq. (2) is complied with the generalized coordinate 
XYZ in Fig. 4(a) that might be regarded as an ENU (East, 
North, UP) coordinate. Right-hand rule is also applied  to 
define polarity of platform attitude RP θθ   , and Hθ and rate 
ZYX ωωω   and  ,  with ,  , RXPY θωθω && ==  HZ θω &= . 
    Autopilot manages the conversion of trajectory error from 
inertia frame  XYZ  to platform  moving frame  X1Y1Z1  via  
coordinate transformation matrix MIC  .  
    Inertia navigator provides measured wheel position and 
platform attitude of pitch, roll and heading by processing 
from IMU (Inertia measurement unit) as

In case of forward right turn with  0,>RT 0<xθ& ,  0<zω , 
Eq. (26) is of underdetermined problems. While making a 
right turn as given in Fig. 8, tilting torque caused by mg is 
dynamically balanced by that of centrifugal force F along roll 
axis. This physical meaning results in the fact that roll angle

Substituting Eq.(52) into Eq.(21), we may find the open-loop 
poles po are 0, -0.0050, -0.0005+j3.8794 and -0.0005-j3.8794. 
Obviously it is stable while not satisfied. In Eq.(47), a typical 
choice for weighting matrix Q1 and R1 is

The closed-loop poles pc are -0.7024+j0.7023, -0.7024-
j0.7023, -6.3343+j7.4279, -6.3343-j7.4279. It shows that the 
poles of open loop in Eq. (21) have less damping with natural 
frequency at 3.8794. However the poles of closed loop by 
using state feedback gain K1 in Eq. (50) get more satisfied 
damping close to ξ=0.7.  
     After finishing LQR design, the simulation of trajectory

The gain K2 obtained from the following simulation is 
                 K2 =[1.5670    0.1113   -1.0000]                          (57) 
      The results also point out that the open-loop poles po are 0,        
+j3.1780 and -j3.1780. The closed-loop poles pc are -10.6164 
+j2.1142, -10.6164-j12.1142 and -6.9204. It is obvious that 
the poles of open loop imply a situation of critical stable. 
However the poles of closed loop show more satisfied 
damping close to ξ=0.7 and time constant close to 0.15sec.  
     After finishing LQR design, the simulation of trajectory 
following is schemed again as follows. The region-#2 plot for 
programmed trajectory, started from position [ ]T 10  0  but in 
the time interval 18.5t7.19 ≤≤  with time increment 
0.01secT = , is given in Fig.12(a).  
     Similar to the LQR longitudinal control given by Fig.10, 
the lateral input Uref2 is expressed by   
                         Uref2=Ucom2+Udist2
