Depending on the relative strength of the 
normal processes and resistive processes, the 
phonon propagation can be classified as the 
following modes: ballistics, diffusion, second 
sound, and heat conduction..  
Thermal wave is the collective, or 
hydrodynamic behavior of the interacting 
phonon system that fits in the second-sound 
mode in which the normal processes strongly 
predominate. To study the nonlinear phonon 
hydrodynamic behaviors, Guyer proposed a 
lattice Boltzmann scheme to model the phonon 
gas. In this model, both transverse and 
longitudinal types of phonons that interact with 
one another through a three-phonon collision 
process were performed on a two-dimensional 
hexagonal, the D2Q7, lattices. Although several 
nonlinear phonon behaviors that beyond the 
description of the linearized phonon 
hydrodynamics were successfully demonstrated, 
only the momentum conserving processes, the 
normal processes (N processes), were 
considered in this study.  
Motivated by connecting the microscopic 
phonon interaction modes to their 
corresponding macroscopic heat transfer 
behaviors, the present study examines the heat 
conduction equation from the phonon 
Boltzmann equation. 
II MODELING 
The detailed descriptions will appear in 
the paper to be submitted under the title 
“Phonon thermal wave modeled by lattice 
Boltzmann method.” 
III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. 
Fig. 1 shows temperature distributions 
within a two-layered thin film at several 
particular times. The temperature disturbance is 
mainly confined Layer I for time smaller than 
0.5 and it reaches the layer interface around t = 
0.5. After that, as time keeps evolving part of 
the energy penetrates the interface into Layer II 
and part of the energy is reflected back to Layer 
I. Since
IIT
τ is larger than
IT
τ , the interface is 
able to reflect a relative minus wave back to 
Layer I. As time evolves to t = 0.6 and 0.8, the 
reflected temperature pulse in Layer I moves 
continuously back to x = 0 and the penetrated 
energy makes temperature in Layer II increased. 
As time goes around t = 1.0, both the reflected 
wave in Layer I and the penetrated wavefront 
in Layer II reach boundaries at x = 0 and x = 1. 
As time keeps increases, the wall at x = 0 
reflects a positive wave back to Layer I, and the 
wall at x = 1 reflects a negative wave back to 
Layer II that passes the “cooling” into the film. 
These two reflected waves meet each other at 
layer interface around time t = 1.55. The waves 
keep being dissipated and spreading as 
propagation continues and become more and 
more unclear. At steady state the temperature 
distribution is very close to a straight line in the 
whole film. This is because for the present case 
the difference between αI and αII is very small 
and discrepancy in τT of the two layers makes 
no contribution to the steady-state response. 
This is an expected result since Eq. (56) 
reduces to 022 =∂∂ xθ as t . The material 
property τ
∞→
T thus only affects heat transfer at 
transient but plays no role at all at steady state.  
History of temperature at layer interface is 
presented in Fig. 2. The interface temperature 
based on DPL model, denoted as , shows 
the interface is almost undisturbed until the 
arrival of heat disturbance. It then increases 
rapidly at the duration as the front of 
temperature rising is passing through the 
interface, t = 0.5 to 0.6, then increases slowly 
to the maximum value around t = 1 at which 
the thermal wave arrives x = 1. Thus at this 
stage (
DPL
intθ
10 ≤≤ t ), the temperature increase at 
interface is due to the “heating” from wall at x 
= 0. At the 2nd stage (1 t ≤ 2), the interface 
temperature decreases from maximum to a 
minimum around t = 2. This cooling is owing 
to the reflected wave from the cold wall at x = 1. 
It is note there is a little “rebound”, circled in 
Fig. 2, occurring during t = 1.5 to 1.6. This is a 
result from the positive wave reflecting from 
the heating wall that is passing through the 
interface at this duration (see temperature 
distribution curve at t = 1.55 on Fig. 1). At the 
3
≤
rd stage, 32 ≤≤ t , interface temperature 
increases and then decreases at the 4th 
stage, 43 ≤≤ t . This oscillation keeps with the 
same period until it is indistinguishable. The 
rebound at the 2nd stage still appears at the 3rd 
stage but become undetectable since the 4th 
stage. 
Results for PTWE based on the present 
 2
distribution and the displaced Planck 
distribution, respectively...
Thermal wave equation based on DPL 
model is reduced to the diffusion model based 
on Fourier’s law through either reducing τq to 
zero or τT approaches to τq at finite τq. Phonon 
propagating modes, however, indicates that 
switching from the second sound mode to the 
diffusion mode can only be accomplished 
through reducing τq to zero. Thus, reduction 
from wave mode to diffusion mode through the 
later path claimed in DPL model, τT 
approaching toτq, finds no compatible 
microscopic propagating modes. That is, 
missing of the 4th-ordered spatial derivative 
term in DPL model fundamentally leads to 
improper direction in mode reduction from 
thermal wave to diffusion. 
The DPL mode shows, for a two-layered 
structure in which 
III TT
ττ > , the layer interface 
reflects a relative minus wave as an increasing 
temperature front is coming and the interface 
temperature oscillates periodically with 
damping until steady state. The steady-state 
response based on DPL model is exactly the 
same as that of the diffusion model, difference 
in τT thus only affects the process in transient. 
Furthermore, for an ideal contact, temperature 
is always continuous at interface, thermal 
resistance at interface due to material difference 
is unclear. Unlike the DPL model, solution of 
PTWE shows the interface reflects a positive 
wave and τT affects both the process of 
transient as well as the response at steady state. 
With its advantage of description phenomena in 
microscopic scale, temperature jumps at 
boundary and interface can be calculated 
naturally and straightforwardly by the present 
lattice Boltzmann method once material 
properties and boundary conditions are set.
