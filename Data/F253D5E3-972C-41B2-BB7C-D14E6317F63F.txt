Abstract: 
Due to the high complexity, overhead 
caused by frequent exchanges of global 
information, and/or the unavailability of 
required information/functionality, none of 
existing energy-efficient multicast 
algorithms is applicable to large-scale 
wireless multihop networks. To address 
these issues, in this project we study the 
application-layer energy-efficient multicast 
problem. Our main contributions are as 
follows: First, without knowing the path 
details and full network topology, the path 
energy is predicted based on statistical 
properties of the network. For accurate 
prediction, we derive lower and upper 
bounds for the expected path energy of the 
minimum-energy path. Second, the 
Predictive Energy-efficient Multicast 
Algorithm (PEMA) is proposed to 
seamlessly integrate existing unicast routing 
protocols, by serving at the application-layer 
multicast. PEMA is fast enough to be 
applied to large-scale networks consisting of 
1000 or more nodes; this is because its 
complexity depends on multicast group size, 
as opposed to network size. Extensive 
simulation results show that PEMA results 
in significant energy savings, compared to 
existing energy-efficient multicast 
algorithms.

Therefore, heuristics that save multicast 
energy by exploiting multi-hop routing and 
wireless multicast advantage are proposed. 
Representative heuristics include the 
Multicast Least-Unicast algorithm (MLU) 
[5], the Multicast Link-Based Minimum 
Spanning Tree algorithm (MLiMST) [5], 
and the Multicast Incremental Power 
algorithm (MIP) [5]. Their complexity 
ranges from O(n2) to O(n3), where n is the 
number of nodes in the network. 
Unlike static wireless networks, global 
information is usually unavailable in mobile 
ad-hoc networks (MANETs) for two main 
reasons. First, in MANETs, frequent 
topology changes and dynamic group 
membership cause substantial control 
overhead [16]. Particularly in large-scale 
MANETs consisting of 1000 or more nodes, 
retrieving global information becomes 
infeasible due to the huge overhead. Second, 
scalability causes a serious issue. Any 
algorithm of complexity above O(n2), where 
n is network size, is obviously too slow to be 
used at run time. This motivates the need for 
a new solution to the minimum-energy 
multicast routing problem in large-scale 
MANETs. 
Although a distributed routing protocol 
seems appropriate to solve the scalability 
and overhead problems, it has its own 
problems. There have been many distributed 
unicast protocols (e.g., [6],[7],[8],[9]) and 
multicast protocols (e.g., [10],[11],[12]) 
designed for MANETs. Although the 
multicast protocols are able to route packets 
and manage dynamic group membership in a 
distributed manner, none of them considers 
energy savings explicitly. In addition, as 
stated in [15], the adverse effects caused by 
their distributed management of group 
membership include security issues (due to 
the lack of end-to-end admission control 
between sources and destinations) and large 
router resource usage (due to a large number 
of routing entries that may grow 
exponentially as the multicast group size 
increases). Such drawbacks stem from the 
absence of natural support for end-to-end 
signaling between source-destination pairs 
and the lack of an efficient way to aggregate 
multicast routing table entries. These issues 
get worse as the numbers of groups and 
network nodes increase, since all routers 
involved in multicast forwarding have to 
participate in multicast routing state 
maintenance. 
3. Simulation Results 
Parts of details for related analytical 
results can be found in [30]. In this section, 
we evaluate, by simulation, the energy 
efficiency of PEMA with continuous 
transmission power/ranges, compared to 
existing multicast tree heuristics. The 
important parameters for these 
configurations include the average number 
of nodes, the propagation loss exponent α, 
and the group size g. For each configuration, 
we ran simulations over 100 network 
instances and then average the results. 
Because of negligible computational cost 
but good accuracy when α = 2, the 
algebraic-mean prediction is used in this 
simulation setup.

4. Conclusion 
In this project, we have addressed the 
application-layer energy-efficient multicast 
problem. To solve this problem, we have 
derived lower and upper bounds for the 
expected minimum path energy given very 
limited information and developed the 
Predictive Multicast Multicast Algorithm 
(PEMA) for energy savings in wireless 
multihop networks. 
The features that make PEMA distinct 
from other energy-efficient multicast 
algorithms proposed to date are twofold. 
First, PEMA is extremely fast because its 
running time is independent of the network 
size. Indeed, while previous algorithms may 
result in very long execution times, PEMA is 
fast enough to run in large-scale wireless 
multihop networks composed of more than 
1000 nodes. Second, the routing decisions of 
PEMA do not rely on the actual information 
about network topology or path details. 
Finally, our simulation results show that, 
in terms of energy efficiency, PEMA 
outperforms all the well-known algorithms 
proposed to date.
