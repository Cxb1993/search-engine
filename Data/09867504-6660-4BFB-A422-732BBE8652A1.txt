1一、摘要
併接於配電系統的風力發電機會影響網路上的電流或網路潮流，使得節點電
壓也隨之產生變化。隨著風力發電機裝設數量及機組容量的增加，這種電壓變動
現象將會愈明顯。當供電電壓必須被控制在電力公司及用電戶的允許範圍內，因
風力發電的併入系統造成的配電饋線穩態電壓變動，在風力發電機組裝設前，必
須加以評估分析。然而，在配電系統中存在著許多會影響饋線穩態電壓變動計算
的不確定變數，為提供更可靠的系統衝擊影響訊息，這些不確定變數必須被考慮
在配電饋線電壓變動分析中。本計畫主要目的為建立一套分散式電源與配電系統
併聯運轉之饋線電壓變動計算模式，並對含分散式電源之配電饋線電壓變動進行
控制改善。分析結果可作為分散式電源與配電系統併聯評估與運轉改善參考。

Abstract
Wind power generators connected to distribution grids affect the currents, or
power flows in the distribution grid, and thus node voltages that are strongly related to
power flows also are changed. This effect will be increasingly obvious when the
penetration of wind power generation is increased. As the voltage must be within
certain limits to comply with utility and customer requirements, this effect should be
assessed prior to installation of wind turbines. However, there are a number of
attributes that can affect the voltage variations in distribution feeders. To provide
more reliable impact study results and system operation performance, the uncertain
factors and their correlations should be considered in the analysis. This project aims to
build a set of analysis model for evaluation and improvement of voltage variations in
distribution feeders with distributed generation (DG). The developed model can be
used for assessing the penetration level of distribution generations and assisting
engineers in determining effective voltage control strategies.

二、計畫緣由與目的
穩態電壓變動，或稱長時間電壓變動或緩慢電壓變動，為電力品質優劣的重
要指標之一[1]。穩態電壓產生變動的原因是因電流經過電力系統中的線路阻抗
會產生壓降，以至於無法以恆壓方式適當地對負載供電。換言之，對負載來說，
也可以說是供電系統太弱，使得在重載時，電壓會降得很低；相反地，當提高電
源電壓大小以克服阻抗所造成之壓降時，卻會在輕載時，可能發生過壓現象。
輸配電系統正常運轉主要功能是維持所有用電戶在適當的操作電壓，用電設
備在正常操作時，配電饋線電壓需維持在 IEEE ANSI C84.1中規定5%之上下限
值[2]，輸電系統通常會較配電系統要求較嚴格，如圖 1 所示。在短時間或緊急
事件情況下，IEEE ANSI C 84.1 允許使用電壓可以處於標稱電壓的百分之
+6~-13%範圍內。對於某些敏感性負載，通常會有較嚴格的電壓變化限制，讓設
備盡量接近標稱電壓值下操作。
3話，發生的次數或機率及超出的電壓大小為多少？基於估測出的隨機電壓分佈範
圍，系統規劃者可以對合理的風力發電併入量作正確可靠地估算，同時也可以進
一步作系統風險分析(risk analysis)。
此外，對於分散式電源併入系統後造成的電壓變動問題，最簡單的改善方式
是在線路上新增電壓調整器(voltage regulator)。另一方面，雖然分散式電源運轉
會改變原系統網路電壓，但透過適當的操作控制，分散式電源也可以來調節或支
援配電饋線電壓，使饋線電壓符合管制規定[7-9]。舉例來說，操作在落後功因的
分散式電源可以用來改善饋線過電壓現象，此時分散式電源如同欠激同步發電機
或感應發電機；操作在超前功因的分散式電源則可以用來改善饋線低電壓現象，
此時分散式電源如同過激同步發電機。當併入至系統的分散式電源造成配電饋線
電壓變動過大而超過允許範圍時，對分散式電源作適當控制，來配合或取代電壓
控制設備，以調節饋線電壓，對於考慮分散式電源之配電系統而言，也是另一種
有效且可行的電壓控制方式。
本計畫主要目的是建立一套分散式電源與配電饋線併聯之穩態電壓變動計算
分析模式與電壓控制模式。穩態電壓變動之估測是以隨機方式對含風力發電之配
電饋線未來運轉可能存在的不確定變數進行模式化，且為有效改善分散式電源併
入配電系統後之網路電壓變動現象，本計畫提出幾種可能的電壓控制策略來管理
網路電壓，這些電壓控制策略是在不新增設備狀況下，對系統現有設備進行電壓
管理，以增加 DG可允許併接容量。本計畫以 IEEE饋線測試系統及台電配電系
統進行實例分析，來說明分析模式之執行成效。

潮流計算程式中。
3.1.2 不確定因素之機率數學模型
(1)時變風力發電量機率模型
風力發電系統加入電力系統後，最大的問題之一就是風力所產生的電能大小
與風速大小有直接的關係，而風速的大小是一個變動性的能量來源。根據相關研
究顯示，雖然風速大小很難加以精確的預測，然而某一特定風速大小的發生機率
卻可以有效地加以預測。一般來說，風速機率分佈可以表示成一個 Weibull
Distribution[12]，風速大小與風機發電量可由下式表示：

其中 PV為風機發電量，Pr為風機額定容量，v為風速大小，Vci為風機啟動風速，
Vco為風機停止風速，Vr為風機滿載輸出風速。
一旦風速確定後，注入到系統的電能即可利用式(1)來加以計算。所以考慮
風力發電之隨機負載潮流計算，可利用風能機率分佈的方式，結合風速發電轉換
公式得到一天不同時段之風力發電注入功率隨機量，最後併入到系統利用負載潮
流程式來加以評估。另外，除了風力機組發電機率模式外，風力機組之容量與機
型的差異，及因各機組間之位置與角度間的差異所導致風力發電機組間承受的風
速與風力大小產生差異等，也可以視需要考慮在風力發電與電力系統併聯的負載
潮流分析中。一般的作法可依據個別機組的特性將每部風力發電機組的實功率與
虛功率輸出相加，再整合在負載潮流分析中。若同一風力場的發電機組不考慮個
別發電機組型式及風速大小差異時，功率之計算可將整個場區的所有機組功率大
小合併，依風速的大小，來求出不同風速下，整場之風力發電量。而當考慮個別
機組位置及方向時，則須依照個別風力機組所承受的風力大小，相對應的功率大
小依序加以計算後相加，作為整個風力發電廠的輸出功率。
(2)時變負載量機率模型
時變負載量機率模型可以對歷史負載資料進行統計分析來取得。一般常用的
負載機率函數有常態機率分配(Normal Probability Distribution)或離散機率分配
(Discrete Probability Distribution)。根據負載機率密度函數，透過資料取樣，再將
隨機取樣的負載量載入程式中去執行每個小時的電力潮流計算。若計算結果需要
更加精確，可以針對不同用電戶類型，以不同機率密度函數來模式化。常態機率
密度函數一般定義如下[13]：

其中 C為在任一時段上所有可能的系統網路結構組態之集合，Pi,h為每個網路結

一般來說，網路結構改變機率密度函數為離散機率分佈函數，本計畫依據其
機率模型隨機產生一天不同時段不同網路結構發生機率，並依照所產生的網路結
構資料，來執行電壓變動計算。
3.2 電壓控制模式
3.2.1 分散式電源可併聯容量數學模型
現今配電系統的設計是接受由輸電系統傳送來的大電力，並分配給用戶，因
此實功和虛功流向是從高壓至低壓。即使在相互連接的配電網路，功率流向也相
同，網路行為也就容易瞭解，系統設計及運轉操作程序也早就建立完備。然而，
當大量分散式電源併入配電系統，電力潮流流向可能會與傳統由上游往下游相
反，此時配電網路已不再僅是一個傳送電力給負載的被動電路，而是一個由分散
式電源及負載來決定電力潮流及電壓的主動系統。最明顯的狀況是當分散式電源
被連接於饋線末端，且網路上的負載量最少，分散式電源輸出增大時，網路潮流
將逆送電力至電力公司電源端，饋線末端電壓也就隨之升高，嚴重影響系統供電
品質。以下以一個簡單的例子來說明分散式電源併聯容量與網路電壓關係。
考慮圖 1 所示之分散式電源與配電網路併聯簡化架構。假設與分散式電源
(DG)併接的匯流排電壓為 VDG，輸出量為 PDGjQDG，併接匯流排上的負載為
PL+jQL，同時，為調節系統虛功及管理電壓，另併接虛功補償器(reactive power
compensator)。透過配電線路與電力公司配電匯流排 i相接。
圖 1：分散式電源與配電網路併聯運轉簡化模型
根據電路分析理論，圖 1中的網路電壓 Vi可以用下式來近似[17]：

根據式(8)，可得知對於特定線路，當線路阻抗 R及 X已知，且為固定常數，
考慮 DG併接點電壓上限值 maxDGV ，若要提高 DG可允許併接容量
max
DGP ，可提高
importQ 或降低 iV 。因此從系統運轉觀點來看，可從這兩方面來整合分散式電源，
透過配電網路現有電壓控制設備進行虛功及電壓管理，以提高 DG可併接容量。
以下介紹以式(8)為基礎之配電系統可能的電壓控制策略。
Control-I：虛功控制
虛功管理對網路電壓及 DG可併聯容量有很明顯的影響，尤其是對架空配電
線路。若 importQ 是吸收網路虛功，則在無載情況下，DG的可併聯容量可進一步
提升，最大可併聯容量 maxDGP 可表示如下：
R
XQ


 (9)
由式(9)可看出網路虛功量受限於線路電抗 X 大小，線路電抗 X 愈大，虛功
補償效果愈明顯，因此虛功補償控制對架空線路(電抗 X約為 0.4/km)比地下線
路(電抗 X約為 0.1/km)要來有成效。當 DG併聯容量增加，由網路的虛功吸收
量也要隨之增加，才能確保網路電壓不會超出允許範圍外，降低 DG對電壓之影
響，以增加 DG可併聯容量。但值得注意的是吸收虛功將造成線路損失增加，因
此評估此控制策略，須同時考慮線路損失。
Control-II：電壓控制
藉由系統現有電壓控制設備來調整網路電壓 iV ，以控制併接點電壓，可增加
DG併接容量。在此控制策略中，OLTC被用來使網路電壓 iV 達到最小值
min
iV ，
使併接點上有較大的實功注入量，其數學方程式如下所示：

Control-III：虛功與電壓整合控制

增加 DG可併聯容量，如式(11)所示。

使用風機總裝置容量 6 p.u，表 1與表 2中的資料，利用一整天之饋線負載
量及風機發電變化量，24小時的電壓分佈範圍可以被估測出來，測試結果如圖 3
所示。圖 3所示分別為在重載下所有饋線電壓最大值、平均值、及最小值統計資
料。由圖 3 可以看出由於考慮了電壓控制設備操作，迫使電壓限制在預設範圍
內，使得饋線電壓實際的分佈範圍被控制在預設範圍(0.95p.u.~1.05p.u.)內。圖 4
所示為未考慮電壓控制設備下之饋線電壓變動統計資料。比較圖 3及圖 4可以看
出當電壓控制設備未操作前，節點 15，17，18，19，110，111，112的電壓分佈
範圍低於饋線電壓限制下限(0.95 p.u.)，經由電壓控制設備操作調整後，這些電
壓被控制至預設範圍內。
圖 3：電壓控制設備操作後之饋線電壓變動統計資料
圖 5及圖 6分別為圖 3及圖 4中節點 15及 112之電壓分佈範圍。從圖 5及
圖 6中可以很清楚地看出這種效應。當電壓控制設備未被操作前，節點 15電壓
整個分佈範圍是低於電壓限制範圍最小值，低電壓(電壓低於最小允許值)產生機
率為 100%節點 112電壓分佈範圍則約有 0.1%的累積機率低於電壓限制最小值，
13
出當隨機網路結構資料被考慮時，除平均值外，饋線電壓統計資料均與未考慮網
路結構不確定性之統計資料不同，節點 110及 111（接近 sw13）電壓的標準差及
最小值之差異尤其明顯。由表中的測試結果也可以發現由於風機併接於節點 16
及 112，使得這兩個節點的電壓平均值較大，高於附近節點的電壓平均值。
圖 6：節點 112電壓變動分佈範圍
圖 7：不同網路結構機率下饋線電壓估測誤差
不同風機裝置容量下之饋線電壓變動範圍也被加以分析。使用未考慮風力發
電之隨機負載潮流解為基準，在風機總裝置容量為原容量的 100%，133%，166%，
及 200%下，以未考慮風力發電之隨機負載潮流解予以標稱化，計算一天不同時
段饋線電壓平均值及標準差之變動量，測試結果分別如圖 8及圖 9所示。由圖 8
可以看出在負載量增加時段(上午 8點到下午 5點)之饋線電壓平均值隨風機裝置
容量增加而增加，這是因為在此時段，饋線電壓相對來得低，而併入饋線的風機
發電量會提高饋線電壓，造成整個饋線電壓分佈向較大的電壓移動。當風機裝置
容量由 100%增加至 200%時，在重載時之饋線電壓平均值的變動量約增加 1.5至
15
選用台電實際饋線進行分析，測試系統架構如圖 10 所示。該實際測系統為台電
日南變電所 2 號主變壓器之日春饋線，主變額定電壓比為 69kV/11.4kV、容量
25MVA、阻抗值 9.21%，分別供應電力至日安、日泉、日祥與日春四條饋線。
圖 10中將日春線分成 B0-B18個匯流排，饋線主要負載以 UA28-1到 UA28-9表
示之。測試系統各節點尖離峰負載量及各線路參數資料分別如表 4及 5所示。考
慮於匯流排 B9併聯同步風力發電機，為定功率因數運轉。另外，為測試電壓控
制策略對網路電壓及 DG 可併聯容量的影響，於併接點上連接一組虛功補償設
備，並以 OLTC控制匯流排 B0電壓。利用上述三種電壓控制方式來管理因 DG
併入系統後造成的電壓問題，Control-I、Control-II、Control-III 之測試結果分別
如表 6至表 8所示。
圖 9：不同風機併入容量下饋線電壓標準差變化情形
圖 10：電壓改善之測試系統架構
17
統吸收虛功，當併入量過大，會造成電壓降問題，此時虛功補償器必須向網路送
出虛功。由表 6(b)中可以看出當 DG 運轉於落後功因，併入量由 1MW 增至
15MW，於重載下， cQ 由 0MVAr增至 3.2MVAr，線損由 0.072MW增至 2.55MW；
於輕載下， cQ 由 0MVAr增至 2.6MVAr，線損由 0.011MW增至 2.86MW。上述
測試結果已顯示藉由適當的虛功控制確實可以降低 DG對網路電壓之影響，達到
電壓管理目的，有助於增加 DG最大可允許併聯量。由測試結果也可以得知系統
在不同運轉情形下，為符合電壓限制條件，所需的虛功控制量，可作為虛功補償
器規劃及操作參考。另外，不同虛功控制操作，將造成不同程度的線路損失，因
此評估電壓控制策略的成效，除找出虛功控制設備最小容量外，必須將線損考慮
在評估中。
表6：Control-I測試結果
(a)pf=0.95超前
(b)pf=0.95落後
藉由網路上現有電壓控制設備的調整，可以改善 DG併入系統之電壓問題，
DG運轉於 0.95超前功因及落後功因情況下，採用 Control-II的測試結果分別如
表 7(a)及 7(b)所示。在此測試案例中，OLTC Tap大小將隨 DG併入系統造成的
網路電壓變動，對匯流排 B0 電壓 0BV 進行自動控制，以改善整個饋線電壓。由
表 7(a)及 7(b)中的測試結果可以看出，當 DG運轉於超前功因，隨著 DG併入量
增加，網路電壓上升，OLTC控制 0BV 降低，此時 OLTC Tap數隨 DG併入量增
加而加大；反之，當 DG在落後功因下運轉，網路電壓隨遮併入量增加而下降，
必須控制 0BV 上升，此時 OLTC Tap數隨 DG併入量增加而減少。值得一提是由
於 OLTC對 DG併入系統的電壓控制改善效果並不如虛功補償設備來得有效，因
此，表 7(a)及 7(b)中的測試結果並無法使不同 DG併入量下的所有饋線電壓大小
都符合要求。

flows also are changed. As the voltage must be within permitted
limits to comply with utility and customer requirements, this
effect should be assessed prior to DG connection. At the
distribution level there are a number of attributes that can
influence the voltage profiles and this assessment requires
detailed distribution operation models. To provide reliable
voltage evaluation results, a new probabilistic methodology is
proposed in this paper. The distribution system operation
uncertainties including daily time varying load, stochastic DG
power production, network configuration, and voltage control
devices operation are all taken into account. A probabilistic load
flow method based on an efficient algorithm is used to handle
uncertainties in loads and DG output power and voltage control
devices operation. Accordingly, a probabilistic network
reconfiguration model is employed to take stochastic network
configurations for service restoration or load balancing into
consideration. The proposed probabilistic method provides a
better knowledge of the voltage effects and can be used for
evaluating the level of DG that might be accepted on a
distribution network. The models developed can also be used for
assessing impact of voltage mitigation equipment on distribution
operating performance. Test results of a modified IEEE feeder
test system demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

I. INTRODUCTION
TILITY and customer equipment are designed to operate
at a certain voltage rating. In order to function properly, it
is essential that the voltage is kept close to the nominal value
in the entire power system. In distribution networks, this is
achieved by dedicated equipment for voltage control, thus a
well-designed distribution system can keep the voltage at all
nodes within the allowed band width.
Owing to conventional energy source deficiency,

environmental considerations, and advancement in distributed
energy technology, distributed generation (DG) has played an
important role in the harvesting of renewable sources. By its
location relatively close to end-use customers, DG can
improve the supply reliability and defer or reduce transmission
and distribution system costs and potentially can have a
beneficial effect on network losses depending on its location
and size. In the foreseeing future it is expected for increased
penetration level of DG into the existing distribution system.
Although the practical capacity of these systems is relatively
small, their cumulative effect may significantly alter the
behavior of the feeder at which they are connected. Their
operations may affect the currents, or power flows, and thus
nodal voltages that are strongly related to power flows also are
changed [1,2]. As the voltage must be within permitted limits
to comply with utility and customer requirements, the voltages
in distribution networks should be evaluated prior to DG
connection.
It would be beneficial for utilities to know the effects of a
given overall DG penetration on feeder operational
characteristics, such as voltage profile, for feeder planning
purposes and designing renewable energy programs [3]. Load-
flow analyses can be carried to assess this effect. These studies
are now usually performed by using extreme conditions with
maximum and minimum of DG generation and demand,
respectively and as a result voltage extremes rather than the
actual shape of the feeder’s voltage profile are obtained to
assess DG. Such study only considers extreme events and
treats all these limiting scenarios as having the same risk. It
does not take into account the likelihood of these events
occurring and cannot give adequate consideration as to how
likely or unlikely various contingencies are [4]. However, new
European standards, i.e. EN-50160, have described voltage
limits in statistical terms that indicate how much and by how
often voltage levels may be exceeded [5]. Although these
standards are not intended for use in assessing the level of
penetration of DG, they point to statistical or probabilistic
approaches as the way forward in such assessments [6]. This is
particularly important because load characteristic become
more unpredictable in an open access environment and most of
DG units are based on renewable energy sources which have a

3In (3), DG units are modeled as load bus with negative
active power, while the reactive power could be positive or
negative. A negative sign is considered, if the DG
(synchronous generators or self commutated inverter systems)
is able to supply reactive power for its essential operation and
a positive sign, if the DG (induction generators or line
commutated inverter systems) absorbs reactive power from the
network [4]. Uncertainty in the ip , ic , and iu causes
variations in the voltage analysis solution. Each parameter can
be seen as a random variable with known statistics that can be
obtained from the historical record, statistical analysis, or
engineering judgment.
III. HANDLING DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UNCERTAINTIES FOR
STOCHASTIC VOLTAGE EVALUATION
A. Handling Daily Time Varying Loads and DG Outputs By
Probabilistic Load Flow Computations
In distribution networks with DG during planning and
operational planning, the DG output patterns are stochastic and
load characteristics become more unpredictable. The PLF
takes these uncertain factors into account in the computations
and evaluate the feeder’s voltage distributions. Many
probabilistic simulation or analytical techniques can be used to
solve the PLF problem. To efficiently and accurately compute
the voltage distributions, a PLF method based on an efficient
and flexible algorithm used in [15] are employed in this paper.
The basic theoretical background of the PLF method used is
described in the Appendix. The details of this method can be
found in [15]. In the computation, it is assumed that the
uncertainties of the feeder loads and DG power production can
be estimated or measured and thus, for a whole 24 hour period
the jth moment of the voltage at node i for the network
configuration ci at the kth hour can be obtained by

values of voltage control devices are used as 1.0 p.u. for tap-
changing transformers, such as voltage regulator (VR) or on-
load tap changer (OLTC), and 0.0 p.u. for switched capacitor
banks.
B. Incorporating Voltage Control Devices Operation
The variations in loads and DG power production can be
considered in the computation by the PLF method. In each
PLF computation, if any of nodal voltages exceeds the
permitted range the dedicated voltage control devices are
operated according to predefined permissible voltage limit.
Many methods can be used for incorporating voltage control
devices operations in the load flow computation [17]. In this
paper, a sensitivity matrix model for the voltage controls is
proposed. The proposed control model can transform the
voltage control device adjustment into the corresponding
power injection shift and uses the inverse of the Jacobian
matrix for the calculation. It does not require evaluation of the
derivatives of the constrained voltage variables with respect to
each controllable parameter and its numerical computation is
straightforward. The main formulas for the proposed model are
shown as follows.
Consider a feeder with n constrained voltage variables and
K voltage control devices. The changes in constrained voltages
due to a shift in voltage control devices can be determined by
uSV  (5)
where V is the voltage variation vector with 1n
dimension. u is the control shift vector with 1K
dimension. S is the sensitivity matrix with Kn dimension.
The ijS that is the element of the S is the sensitivity of the
constrained voltage variation kiV to a controllable
parameter shift ju . Depending on types of the voltage
control devices, ijS can be computed by using the following
equations. For a switched capacitor bank installed at node k,
the ijS is
2vq
)(JS ki,kij V (6)
where vq )(J i,k is the element (i,k) of the relationship matrix
about voltage magnitude and reactive power injection in the
inverse of the Jacobian matrix at (X=X0, U=U
0). X0 is the
mean of the state vector X and U0 is the initial value of the
5control parameters. The voltage distributions are computed
again until all network voltages are within the limit or a
sensitivity value of voltages to a shift for each voltage control
device is below a tolerance factor iεor reaching the control
setting limits. The above computation procedure is repeated
until all network configurations at the kth hour have been taken
care of. The final voltage distributions for all nodes in the
network are evaluated by using (13). Then, the stochastic
voltages for the next hour are evaluated using the above
computational procedure.
Fig. 1 The overall computational procedure of the proposed method
The proposed method is incorporated into the efficient PLF
algorithm for radial distribution networks and gives the
possible ranges of the feeder’s voltage distributions at any time
during the 24-hour cycle of a specific day and season. Thus,
the model can be used for short-term predictions of the
distribution feeder operating performance. The method
basically can be also used for medium-term or even long-term
estimations if the uncertainties in wind availability, load
development, and network configuration in the years ahead are
properly modeled. The proposed probabilistic approach could
provide a much more complete shape of the voltage profiles in
a DG connected distribution network by considering all
possible uncertainties in the system over planning and
operational planning. It also allows engineers to flexibly
incorporate the currently available distribution load flow
models for studying voltage impact in a DG connected
distribution system.
IV. TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
To ensure performance of the proposed method, a modified
IEEE 13 node feeder test system shown in Fig. 2 is used for
the analysis. Each feeder in Fig. 2 is a single-phase network
that is modified from the original three-phase network in [19].
In the test system, the load data of each node in each feeder
equal the average of three-phase loads of the corresponding
node in the original system and the line data are arbitrarily
selected from one of original three-phase line. A typical daily
load profile used in each feeder are assumed to have a normal
distribution with a constant standard deviation of 5%
throughout the whole 24 time period except for nodes 17 and
111 with a discrete distribution with five impulses. In the load
profile, the loads at each hour are modeled to correspond to
the peak load with active power of 3266 kW and reactive
power of 1986 kVAr at 2 pm. All of loads and DG power
production are transformed to p.u. system based on the Sbase of
100 kVA.
Fig. 2 The test system
The stochastic voltage evaluation for Feeder 1 connected to
two identical feeders (Feeder 2 and Feeder 3) through
interfeeder tie switches (sw13 and sw14) is considered. Since
different voltage control devices at different locations can have
different control effects, in Feeder 1 two VRs (T10-13 and T16-19)
with taps between 0.9 and 1.2 p.u. and one switched capacitor
bank (C18) with upper limit of 1.0 p.u. that represents the
maximum capacity are assumed. For effectively testing the
performance of the proposed voltage control model, their

Fig. 4 Probability density functions of voltages at nodes 15 and 112 at 10 am
w/o and with corrective voltage control actions
The results of the voltage control devices parameter and the
number of iterations for Fig. 3(b) are shown in Case 1 of Table
III. The solutions for the same condition using different
adjustment steps of voltage control devices are also presented
and shown in Case 2 and Case 3. It can be found from Table
III that a smaller value of adjustment step for the voltage
control devices results in a smaller total shift but requires a
greater number of iterations. When the Tap of 0.01 p.u. and
Cap of 0.05 p.u. are used, the parameters of T10-13, T16-19, and
C18 converge to 1.02 p.u., 1.02 p.u., and 0.15 p.u., respectively,
and it needs 4 iterations to converge. They are 1.03 p.u., 1.03
p.u., 0.3 p.u., and 2 iterations for the Tap of 0.03 p.u. and
Cap of 0.15 p.u.. The results showed that by properly
choosing the shift step for voltage control devices, the voltage
control parameter adjustment against stochastic feeder loads
and DG power production can be carried out in an effective
way. Generally speaking, it is possible to have an adequate
voltage profile without voltage control devices if the capacity
of DG units is much smaller than the loads in the system.
However, for a relatively large DG capacity the voltage quality
may not be maintained if voltage control devices are not
sufficient. In this situation, for better results additional voltage
control devices should be used. Test results of Fig. 3(a), 3(b),
4(a), 4(b), and Table III have shown that the proposed control
model could be effective for voltage controls since the
controlled nodal voltages are close to the limits and the
iteration for its computations is less.

The proposed method can also take care of the uncertainty
in network configurations. Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) show the voltage
distributions at nodes 16 and 111 during a light load time
period (2 am) without and with consideration of random
network configurations, respectively. It can be seen from Fig.
5(a) that when random network configurations are taken into
account, the influence of network reconfiguration on voltage
distributions is significant. Let Vmax and Vmin denote the
voltages in Prob>0.99 and Prob<0.01, respectively. Then, the
Vmax and Vmin of Fig. 5(a) without and with considering
random network configurations are 0.975 p.u., 0.979 p.u. and
0.973 p.u., 0.985 p.u., respectively. These estimates in Fig. 5(b)
for considering random network configurations are 0.966 p.u.
and 0.972 p.u. compared to 0.9551 p.u. and 0.9721 p.u. for not
considering random network configurations. It can be seen
from Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) that the voltages at nodes 16 and 111
are within the limits. The main difference between these two
curves lies in the lower and/or upper voltage sides. It has
shown that the variation of voltage at node 111 is larger than
that for node 16. This is because the node 111 is relatively
close to the interfeeder tie switch and the voltages at the nodes
in the vicinity of the tie switch are easily affected due to the
network reconfiguration between Feeder 1 and Feeder 2.
The random network configurations’effect on voltage
distributions during a heavy load time period (2 pm) is also
tested and the results are shown in Fig. 6(a) and 6(b), which
depict the voltages in nodes 16 and 111, respectively. From
Fig. 6(a), it can be seen that when random network
configurations are considered the voltage distribution at node
16 violates the lower limit with a cumulative probability of
0.04%. Comparing Fig. 6(a) to Fig. 5(a), it can be found that
the voltage variation for a heavy load time period is larger than
that for a light load time period but the voltage distribution is
smaller. This observation can be also seen from the
comparisons of Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 5(b). This is because a larger
load usually can cause a larger variation as a result of a larger
voltage variation.
Comparisons of statistics of voltage distributions, such as
mean (), standard deviation (), Vmin, and Vmax, during a
heavy load time period with and without consideration of
9133%, 166%, and 200% wind powers, which represent the
wind power of total 6, 8, 10, and 12 p.u., respectively, are
computed and the results are shown in Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b),
which depict the changes in errors in mean and standard
deviation, respectively. From Fig. 8(a), it can be seen that the
estimate variations (errors) in mean increase with an increase
in penetration of wind power during a heavy load time period
(8 am to 5 pm). When the penetration of wind power is
increased from 100% to 200%, the change in average
variations in mean of voltages during a heavy load time period
can be about 1.5 to 2 times. This is because during this time
period the voltages are relatively low and a relatively large
wind power penetration significantly could affect the voltages,
which results in a larger estimate variation in mean of voltage
distributions. The maximum value of average estimate
variations in mean is about 0.51% even for 200% wind power
generations, which is fairly small. Fig. 8(b) shows the average
variations in estimate in standard deviation of voltage
distributions. The result shows that during a heavy load time
period the feeder loads may be relatively larger than the wind
power production, thus the impact of stochastic wind power
outputs on voltage distributions can be minimized but it would
be more obvious for a light load time period.

Since voltage profiles in the network significantly are
affected by DG operation models, additional tests using
different power factor settings of wind power are executed in
order to understand different DG operation models’impact on
voltage distributions. Test results have shown that the DG to
operate with a leading power factor at a light load time period
could lead to the serious voltage raise effect and the voltage
decline effect is generally caused by a lagging power factor at
a heavy load period. They also indicates that for the same load
condition, when a larger lagging power factor is used the
whole voltage distribution would shift to a higher voltage level
but it shifts to a lower level if the DG is operated using a larger
leading power factor.

2control in the presence of DG. Two optimal power flow based
voltage control methods including centralized and distributed
managements are proposed in [9] for voltage and reactive
power control of the distribution network with DG. [10]
proposed a combined local and remote voltage and reactive
power control method in a distribution system with induction
machine based DG to optimum voltage profile and minimize
losses in the distribution system..
As the present network operation philosophy is known to
considerably limit the amount of embedded generation that can
be connected, the focus of this paper is on increasing the
permission penetration of DG into distribution network in
terms of the increased voltage control ability of the networks
to accommodate DG using the existing voltage control devices
as well as DGs’voltage control capability. This integration
effectively changes the conventional doctrine of the operation
of distribution networks from passive to active. A mathematic
relationship between permissible penetration of DG and
distribution voltage control is modeled. Various degrees of
integration ranging from a simple local based control of
generation to a coordinated control between distribution and
generation facilities over interconnected distribution circuits
are proposed. Their effects on the permissible level of
penetration of DG are tested on a practical distribution system.
II. MATHEMATIC MODELING OF DG PERMISSIBLE
PENETRATION AND VOLTAGE CONTROLS
Connections of DG in distribution systems are generally
susceptible to voltage variations. Current distribution network
operating policy limits the capacity of generation connected
based on the extreme condition of minimum load, maximum
generation. In order to minimize the overall effect of DG
network operators prefer to connect DG at higher voltages
where their impact onto voltage levels is minimal. However,
the commercial viability of DG projects is sensitive to
connection costs. These costs increase considerably with the
voltage level at which the DG is connected; generally the
higher the voltage or sparser the network, the higher the cost.
The developers of DG therefore prefer to connect at lower
voltages. This conflict of objectives between DG developers
and network operators is usually settled through simple
deterministic load flow studies, usually based on one critical
case representing conditions of minimum load and maximum
DG output. The following equations are to derive the
mathematic relationship of DG permissible penetration and
voltage controls.
Considering that a simplified circuit shown in Fig. 1
represents the basic features of a distribution system into
which a DG is connected. This generator (PDG, QDG) together
with a local load (PL, QL) and a reactive power compensator
(QC) is connected to the distribution system via a distribution
line with impedance (R+jX). According to the electrical circuit
analysis theory, the voltage at the busbar connected to DG
(VDG) can be approximately obtained as follows [1]:
X)QQQ(R)PP(VV CLDGLDGiDG  (1)
Fig. 1. A simplified circuit for modeling the relationship between DG
penetration and voltage control.
From (1), it is clearly shown that the VDG is influenced by
various factors, these being the line resistance (R), the line
reactance (X), the DG power output (PDG, QDG), the reactive
power compensator (QC), a local load (PL, QL), and the voltage
at busbar i (Vi). Therefore, network voltages can be managed
in planning timescales by altering R and X or in operational
timescales by controlling P and Q. It is interesting to note that
if the generator is exporting real power (PDG), at the same time
that it is importing reactive power (-QDG), the voltage change
can be minimized. This is especially true in networks which
have a large X/R ratio, i.e. overhead line networks.
This simple equation can be used to qualitatively analyze
the relationship between voltage at the busbar connected to
DG and the amount of generation that can be connected to
distribution network, as well as the impact of alternative
control actions. For DGs, such as wind power generator and
photovoltaic plant, the voltage at busbar connected to DG is
increased with an increase in wind speed and irradiation, and
consequently the voltages at other buabar in the network are
also increased. If bus voltage is the main consideration for
evaluating the penetration of DG, the maximum permissible
level of penetration of DG can be further derived from (1). As
discussed above, the capacity of generation that can be
connected to a distribution circuit is determined by analyzing
the extreme conditions of the coincidence of minimum load
(PL=0, QL =0) and maximum generation (PDG =PDGmax).
Moreover, for simplifying the problem the unity power factor
operation is assumed, i.e. ±QDG-QL±QC=0. The amount of
generation that can be connected to existing system can be
analyzed by the following expression [1]:

From (2), the capacity of the generator that can be
accommodated in the existing system is clearly limited by the
maximum voltage at busbar connected to DG. They are:

Equations (5) to (7) show the mathematic relationships
between maximum level of penetration of DG and different
control strategies under the condition of minimum load. This
relationship can be used as a reference for voltage controls for
integration of DG and distribution system. However, the
maximum penetration of DG evaluated by these equations may
be more conservative because the probability of occurrence of
minimum load (PL=0) is extremely low. Therefore, in the
practical operation the permissible penetration of DG can be
larger than that obtained from (5) to (7). Furthermore, Control-
I and Control-II are a local control and their control
effectiveness is less than Control-III that is a coordinated
control among distribution and generation control devices.
IV. TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
To analyze the effects of different control strategies on the
voltage profile and permissible level of penetration of DG, a
practical Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) feeder system
[11] is used for the study. The system diagram is shown in Fig.
2. The test feeder system is supplied via a 69kV/11.4kV
transformer with capacity of 25 MVA and impedance of 9.21
%. There is a total of nineteen buses (B0-B18) and main loads
are represented as UA28-1 to UA28-9. Table I shows the
branch data of the test system. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the daily
load profile variation of the test system during heavy and light
loading periods, respectively. The maximum load is 4078 kW
occurring on 12 pm and in the meanwhile the reactive power
is 1340 kVAr and the power factor is about 0.95. On the other
hand, the minimum load is 1010 kW on 2 pm and its reactive
power is 332 kVAr. With the heavy load and light load data
shown in Fig. 3 and 4, the load data of each bus (UA28-1 to
UA28-9) are equally assigned according to the capacity of its
transformer. Table II shows the bus data of the test system
under heavy and light loading periods. Based on the
maximum and minimum loading of #2 MRT and Table II, the
heavy and light loads of other feeders connected to bus B0
can be calculated and they are 11900 kW and 3000 kW,
respectively.Considering different levels of penetration of wind turbine
(WT) connected to bus B9 and to operate with a constant
power factor. Additionally, in order to test and compare
effects of different control strategies on network voltage and
penetration of DG, a reactive power compensator connected
to bus B9 and the OLTC (#2 MRT) are considered. With the
proposed control strategies, the voltage variation problem can
be improved due to penetration of DG through voltage and/or
reactive power managements. Test results for Control-I,
Control-II, Control-III are shown in Table III, IV, and V,
respectively.

6connection for maintaining the system voltage quality. It can
be seen from Table IV (a) and (b) that the network voltages
are raised and declined when an increase in penetration of WT
to operate with 0.95 leading and lagging power factors,
respectively. The tap changer of OLTC is adjusted to fix the
controlled voltage to be 1.0 p.u. for improving voltage profile
against DG connection and thus the tap positions of the OLTC
may be different under different operating power factors and
loading periods as well as WT penetrations. This leads to
different quantities in line losses among these possible
operating conditions. For the operation of 0.95 leading power
factor, the line losses are changed from 0.067 MW to 1.943
MW and from 0.012 MW to 2.134 MW due to PDG of 1 MW
increased to 15 MW under heavy and light loading periods,
respectively, as compared with changing from 0.067 MW to
1.943 MW and from 0.012 MW to 2.134 MW for an operation
with lagging power factor of 0.95. Comparing to Table III and
IV, it is seen that the line losses due to operation of he control
device for Control-II are smaller than those for Control-I. This
is because more reactive powers among generation and
distribution plants are exchanged in a way of reactive power
compensation. It is noted that since the voltage control by
using the reactive compensation is more smooth than voltage
control devices, such as OLTC, the voltage control outcome
for Control-I is more effective than that for Control-II (refer to
Fig. 5 and 6).
TABLE IV
TEST RESULTS FOR CONTROL-II
(A) PF=0.95 LEADING
(B) PF=0.95 LAGGING
Integrating reactive compensators and the existing voltage
control devices (Control-III) can provide a more effective way
for voltage management. Many conditions for Control-III were
tested and some test results are selected and reported in Table
V (a) and (b), which depict the controlled voltage 0BV of 1.00
p.u. and 1.03 p.u., respectively. Comparing Table V to Table
III and IV that since the voltage control and reactive power
control are coordinated in this control strategy, for the same
penetration of WT the quantity and operation of QC and OLTC
tap changer required for voltage management can be
minimized. For example, as seen from Table V (a), when a
WT penetration of 15 MW (PDG=15 MW) is considered the QC
and OLTC tap position required for Control-III are only 0.9
MVAr and 99% compared to 3.2 MVAr and 95.75% for
Control-I and Control-II with a 0.95 lagging power factor
during heavy loading period. The line losses are 2.29 MW
compared to 2.86 MW and 2.414 MW. For a WT with 0.95
leading power factor, the QC and OLTC tap position required
for Control-III are 2.6 MVAr and 100.25% compared to 5.1
MVAr and 100.5% for Control-I and Control-II during light
loading period. The line losses are 0.695 MW compared to
2.41 MW and 2.134 MW. Similar test results are also shown
in Table V (b) except for larger amount of QC, OLTC tap
position, and line losses. This is because the smaller controlled
voltage VB0 can gain flexibility of WT connection and thus the
required voltage and reactive power controls for maintaining
voltage quality can be minimized (refer to Equation (7)). The
implication of the test results is that for a penetration
increment of DG, the coordinated control strategy integrating
generation and distribution plants should be used.

TEST RESULTS FOR CONTROL-III
(A) VB0=1.0 P.U.
(B) VB0=1.03 P.U.
Comparisons of voltage profiles in Table III, IV, and V are
shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, which depict voltage profiles for
DG to operate with pf=0.95 leading during a light loading
period and with pf=0.95 lagging during a heavy loading
period., respectively. From the test results, it can be seen that
the DG with power factor control capability can have a
significant effect on the network voltages. As previously
described, DG to operate with a leading power factor under a
light loading period could lead to the serious voltage raise

Abstract—Due to significant gains in terms of survivability,
weight, manning, and cost obtained from DC zonal electrical
distribution systems (DC ZEDS), various practical applications of
DC ZEDS to shipboard electric power systems are expected in the
foreseeing future. How to ensure whether shipboard DC ZEDS
under different power outage events is secure becomes important
for real-time operation and planning of the system. This paper
proposes a probabilistic AC/DC power flow based security
analysis method. The variations in power generation and load are
considered in the analysis by using probabilistic load flow
computations. Then, a security index that incorporates the
stochastic characteristics of contingency and transmission line
priority and electrical load importance considerations is proposed
for the security analysis. A navy surface combatant shipboard
power system with AC/DC network is used to validate and ensure
the performance of the proposed method.

I. INTRODUCTION
ITH the advancement in power electronic technologies,
navies and ship building corporations have started doing
extensive research for implementing DC zonal electrical
distribution systems (DC ZEDS) in sea and undersea vehicles
to enhance operational flexibility, maximize survivability, and
reduce manning requirements and overall cost [1]. DC ZEDS
is predicated on having starboard and port dc busses feeding
electrical zones delineated by watertight bulkhead
compartments. The main bus dc voltage is stepped down
within the zone and then converted to three-phase ac and lower
voltage dc by additional power converters [2]. In contrast with
current traditional ac radial distribution systems, this type of
distribution system can avoid problems of voltage dips at
various points in the system due to the transients resulting
from any casualty, switching or lighting stroke, or sudden
increase in power demand and alleviate the effect of
propagation of variation of voltage and frequency on
performance of individual equipment and instruments as well
as power electronic converters. Therefore, quality of the power
supply and reliability of the overall system are enhanced and

all features of power electronic based systems are met in DC
ZEDS [3].
Due to significant gains in terms of survivability, weight,
manning, and cost obtained from DC ZEDS, in the foreseeing
future various practical applications of DC ZEDS to shipboard
electric power systems are expected. How to ensure whether
the shipboard DC ZEDS under different power outage events
is secure becomes important for real-time operation and
planning of the system [4]. Contingency analysis that is one of
major power system security functions can be used to model
possible systems troubles before they arise. This analysis is
based on a power flow model under different contingencies
and is used to study outage events and allow systems to be
operated defensively to any potential overloads or out-of-limit
voltages.
For a shipboard architecture that is integrated with DC
zonal distribution, an AC/DC power flow model is necessary
for the security analysis. The AC/DC power flow can consider
the AC/DC network and power converters that allow cases of
load supplied directly to the DC link in their modeling and can
easily incorporate contingency selection to obtain the power
flow solution including bus voltages, line flows, and power
converter operating parameters for the security assessment.
However, the power flow solution is changed due to variations
in power generations and loads and consequently the security
assessment result may not reflect the actual conditions. In
order to obtain a more reliable security assessment result, the
problem could be modeled as a probabilistic one, so called
probability security analysis or stochastic contingency analysis.
The probabilistic security analysis can compute the possible
power flow solution distribution according to the probabilities
of occurrence of power injections and outage events and
determine the critical contingencies that significantly affect the
system operation security.
Literatures relevant to the power system probabilistic
security analysis are focused on utility transmission systems
[5,6]. Works on industrial power systems, such as shipboard
power systems, are still limited. [4] proposed a security index
based on the AC/DC power flow model to consider the
probability of contingency and the priority of the line causing
the violation for security assessment. The DC ZEDS takes care
of various voltage levels and frequency modes of operation by
accommodating different types of power converters, inverters,
and static solid-state frequency converters. In addition to the
supply continuity in the system, voltage regulation in the
critical conditions of component failures due to internal errors
or hostile system disruptions is ensured.
This paper proposes a probabilistic AC/DC power flow

Based on the power converter model shown in Fig. 2, an
AC/DC power flow formulation can be derived. For a
generalized AC/DC power flow model with a three-phase
uncontrolled rectifier connected from ac bus p to dc bus t, the
bus power equilibrium equations for bus i in which no rectifier

From (8) and (9), it is shown that when each rectifier branch
introduced into the AC/DC system, three rectifier operating
variables including dI , α, and β are added to the bus power
equilibrium equations. To obtain an unique power flow
solution, three additional independent residual equations for
each rectifier branch should be added to the bus power
mismatch equations. They can be expressed as [9]

III. PROBABILISTIC SECURITY ASSESSMENT
A. Dealing With Uncertainties
In a shipboard power system, the power generations are
usually dispatched and electrical loads are often controlled to
meet the demand requirements of different navigating missions.
Thus, the generation patterns are not certain and load
characteristics become more unpredictable. In the case of
statistical uncertainty associated with the input data for the
power flow computation, a point estimate does not exactly
indicate the whole result. The PLF study could take into
account uncertainty in the power flow computations and
calculate the system states and branch flows based not only on
expected average or peak values of input data. Instead of
obtaining a point estimate result by the deterministic load
flow, the PLF algorithm evaluates probability density
functions and/or statistical moments of all state variables and
output network quantities to indicate the possible ranges of
the power flow result [10].
Many PLF methods have been proposed to study power flow
uncertainty problem. These methods can be classified as
simulation method, analytical method, or by using a
combination of both. In this paper, an efficient PLF
computation method used in [10] is adopted to handle the
uncertainty in the AC/DC power flow solution due to
variations in power generation and load. In the computation, it
is assumed that the uncertainty of the power production and
electrical loads can be estimated or measured. Then, the jth
moment of the ith element of the AC/DC power flow solution
set for the contingency c can be obtained by [10]

Effects of the generation unit G2 failure on AC/DC power
flow are first presented and their test results are shown in Fig.
4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 which depict voltage distribution of bus 6,
active power distribution of line 2-6 and power rectifier C2
solution distribution, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 4(a)
and 4(b) that the since generation failures can cause changes in
the bus voltages change, the voltage at bus 6 can have different
types of distributions for normal state and generation unit
failure state. From Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), it also can be seen that
for the normal state the voltage distribution is within the
predefined permission range (0.95 p.u.~1.05 p.u.) and for the
generation unit G2 failure the Prob<V- and Prob>V+ are 0.941
and 0.012, respectively. The similar impact can also be seen
from Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) which represent the active power flow
distribution of line 2-6 under normal and G2 failure states,
respectively. Comparing Fig. 5(a) with Fig. 5(b), it is shown
that the line flow P2-6 distribution under normal state does not
violate the line rating limit (0.20 p.u.) but when the G2 failures,
the P2-6 distribution violates its line rating in probability of
0.174. Since the proposed probabilistic AC/DC power flow
method can handle variations in rectifier operation due to
uncertain power flow input data, the solution distributions of
the rectifier operating variables can be computed. Fig. 6(a) and
6(b) show the solution distributions of pre-ignition angle and
communication overlap angle of rectifier C2, respectively. Test
results shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 have indicated that
when considering uncertain input data in power flow
computations, bus voltages and line flows can have different
types of distributions. Test results also show that the
contingency can have a significant effect on the DC ZEDS
security and the stochastic contingency analysis based on
probabilistic power flow provides the operators more
information to decide the system security for all possible
contingencies.

PROBABILISTIC SECURITY ANALYSIS RESULTS
V. CONCLUSIONS
A probabilistic security analysis method for shipboard DC
ZEDS has been proposed. The variations in AC/DC power
flow solution due to uncertain generation and load are
considered in the analysis by using probabilistic power flow
computations. A system security index has been also proposed
to consider electrical load importance and transmission line
priority. A navy surface combatant ship power system has been
used to ensure and validate the performance of the proposed
method. Test results have indicated that the proposed method
can provide the operators more information to decide the
security of system operation for judgment of the proper control
actions.

to the traditional economic dispatch (ED) power flow method 
(to use a commercial software), the first step increases the 
power supply by the participating generators to the most under 
stability condition; while the second step is used to do with the 
convergence problem based on the continuation power flow 
procedure when system state achieved in the first step is close 
to a critical bifurcation point.  
In this paper, an optimal formulation is developed to solve 
for the best GD to determine a corresponding MLM while 
maintaining the system in static voltage stability for an 
oncoming bus voltage critical bifurcation point, with or 
without consideration of generating cost in objective function. 
The solution method is based on the particle swarm 
optimization (PSO) algorithm involving in the CPF process to 
seek for the MLM for each particle, which represents a set of 
candidate generation increments (or GD) for the participating 
generators to provide the increasing demands. Three objective 
functions are proposed. The first one only takes the loading 
parameter as the objective function; hence the MLM 
calculated will be the maximum MLM for the specific loading 
increments. With generation cost function taken as the second 
one, the MLM is determined on the minimum operating cost 
basis; thus, the MLM derived would be correspondent to the 
minimum generation cost. Combined by the above two 
objectives, the last one is to simultaneously maximize the 
MLM as well as minimize the generation cost; thus the result 
derived is a compromise between the MLM and generation 
cost. Different from the previous approaches, in the proposed 
method, taking the generation increments of the participating 
generators as the control variables into the continuation power 
flow formulation, the optimal generation direction for the 
participating generators related to various objectives can be 
determined directly using the proposed solution method.  
In section II, the definitions of the LM and MLM for a 
specific load increase and the GD with search ranges are given. 
The CPF method for seeking the LM is briefly described in 
section III. The optimum generation direction formulation is 
presented in section IV. Three objective functions suggested to 
determine GD are described simply and the solution algorithm 
based on PSO is also given. In section V, a modified IEEE 
30-bus system is used, and different objectives computed 
results are compared with each other and with those derived 
from Cost PF approach. Section VI concludes with a brief 
discussion about the adaptability of the proposed method.  
 
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
The power system model can be formulated as a functional 
vector including the system nonlinear real and reactive power 
flow balance equations in the following form:  
0VθF =),(                             (1) 
where the vectors of the state variables θ  and V  denote 
system bus phase angles and load bus voltage magnitudes. A 
base case power flow can be obtained with the system 
equations.  
When an uncontrollable loading parameter λ  associated 
with a loading margin (LM), that would drive the system from 
one stable equilibrium point to another, is inserted into the 
power flow equations, the system equations become:  
0VθF =),,( λ                           (2) 
If generation and/or load increases are on bus i, the real 
and reactive power balance equations can be described by:

where ijP  and ijQ  are the real and reactive power flows 
from bus i through line i-j; LioGioio PPP +=  and Lioio QQ =  
are the base case injections to bus i; as related to the future 
load increase, the loading increments GiP∆ , LiP∆  and 
LiQ∆  are respectively generation real, load real and reactive 
powers on bus i,  µ∈i , µ  being the set of the PQ buses 
with loading increments. If increases are not allowed, loading 
increments GiP∆ , LiP∆  and/or LiQ∆  would be zero.  
For a specific value of loading parameter λ , the

being the maximum value of λ  will be obtained when the 
system state comes to a saddle-node bifurcation point for 
additional power supply. The MLM can also be referred to as 
the maximum static voltage stability margin (VSM) for the 
specific loading increments, based on bus voltage stability 
collapse or critical constraints.  
In the proposed strategy, the generation increments,  
ν∈∀∆ iPGi   , ν  being the set of the PV buses participating 
in supply for the future power increase except the slack bus 
(bus 1), will be regulated to seek for the MLM, as a vector

where all generation increments must be confined within the 
permissible incremental ranges, i.e.

where equations (17)-(20) are the thermal limits of the line

generation limits, respectively. 
The proposed three objective functions are below:  
a). If simply want to maximize the MLM, then λf −= , the 
maximum MLM will be obtained irrespective of the 
generation cost.  
b). While the system is required to operate under the minimum 
generation cost, GCf = , the MLM in accordance with 
the minimum cost would then be obtained. 
c). λCf G /=  can be used to maximize MLM as well as 
minimize generation cost simultaneously and thus a 
compromised result can be obtained. 
 
The proposed solution method is based on the PSO 
algorithm involving in the CPF process to solve for MLM. 
The bus voltages and λ  are sought through the CPF process 
along the loading path once again each iteration. However, 
those values would not be ascertained until a terminated 
condition met. An introduction to the PSO algorithm is shown 
in the Appendix.

the members in each particle bounded within their repective
ranges defined in Equ.(7).

and the particle to the location for the pbest.

FIGURE 1: FLOWCHART FOR THE PSO-CPF SOLUTION ALGORITHM 
B. Development of the solution method 
In order to relate the variables in the problem formulation 
to the PSO algorithm, a set of generation increments (i.e. GD) 
is denoted as an individual particle for the population of PSO 
and will be randomly reproduced each iteration. Particle ix  
is defined as a vector as follows:  
i
i G∆Px = , pni ,1,2,K=                 (21)  
where pn  is the particle number given, and the members in 
particle ix  are denoted as the ith candidate set of generation 
increments as in Equ.(5).  
The solution algorithm is shown in Fig.1.  
 
V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND RESULTS 
In the tests, a modified IEEE 30-bus system shown in Fig.2 
is used to validate the proposed method. The base data for the 
specific loading increments for loads on buses (18, 19) and the 
participating generators on buses (1, 8, 13) are shown in Table 
1, where the generation increments (or GD) for generators G1, 
G8 and G13 are to be determined. For simplicity, the voltage 
magnitudes for the PV buses shown on the second column of 
Table 1 are all set to be stationary.

The data for the generation cost functions is given in Table 
2. Only considering bus voltage stability as limit, the 
generation increments, criticalλ , MLMs and increased 
generation costs derived respectively with the three objective 
functions for the proposed method and Cost PF approach are 
shown in Table 3. From Table 3, it can be seen that the 
maximum MLM is obtained with cost function λf −=  and 
the minimum increased generation cost obtained with GCf = . 
It can be seen that, with cost function λCf G /= , the 
generation cost and the MLM obtained can be compromised 
between those obtained with the two other objective functions.

generation increments for G13 (about 0.1pu) and almost

generation costs corresponding to various loading increments 
of G8 versus G13 are shown in Figure 6. From Figure 6, it can 
be seen that the minimum increased generation cost can be 
derived with generation increments about 0.06pu and 0.2pu for 
G8 and G13, respectively. The above observations may

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper proposes an optimal formulation to determine a 
good GD for the participating generators to improve system 
MLM for future load increases and minimize the 
corresponding increased generation cost. The solution method 
is based on the PSO algorithm with each particle of the 
population representing a candidate GD, and the CPF process 
is employed in the algorithm to solve for MLM for each 
particle (or GD) considering static voltage stability. From the 
test results, the proposed method was proved better than COST 
PF approach and the effectiveness of the proposed method 
was validated too. Also, due to the adaptability of PSO, the 
three different objective functions proposed can all be used to 
determine a good GD for the respective purposes. 
  
VII. APPENDIX   
PSO is a population-based evolutional computation technique 
originally developed in [15]. It is initialized with a population of 
randomized candidate solutions (locations), called particles. Each 
particle associated with a randomized velocity, is then flown through 
the multidimensional problem space. During flight, each particle 
keeps track of its own experience, which is associated with the best 
fitness achieved by the particle so far. This fitness is called pbest. 
Another experience to be tracked is the global version among all best 
solutions, obtained so far by any particle in the population. This 
fitness is called the gbest.  
The PSO algorithm consists of changing the velocity of each 
particle flying towards the locations associated with its own pbest and 
the gbest. The algorithm is outlined below:  
 
1. Initialize a population of pn  particles, with random locations 
ix and velocities iv in the m dimensional decision variable 
space. 
2. For each particle, evaluate its fitness value and compare the 
fitness value with its own pbest. If the fitness value is better, 
then set the fitness value as the pbest and the location of the 
particle as the location associated with the pbest. 
3. Compare the best pbest for all particles’ with the gbest. If the 
best pbest is better, then reset the best pbest as the gbest and the 
location associated with the best pbest as the location 
gp associated with the gbest. 
4. Change the velocity and location of each particle by the 
following formulas: 
)()( 21 igiiii Randcrandcw xpxpvv −+−+=          (A-1) 
iii vxx +=                                      (A-2) 
5. Go back to step 2 except a stop criterion, usually a sufficiently 
good fitness or a maximum number of iterations, is met. 
 
Where, [ ]T21 ,,, imiii xxx K=x  represents the current 
location, [ ]T21 ,,, imiii vvv K=v  the current velocity and 
[ ]T21 ,,, imiii ppp K=p  the current best location for particle i, { }pni ,1,2, K∈ . The vector gp  represents the current globally 
best location. Parameter w is an inertia weight, in general ∈w [0.2, 
0.9], which will be gradually decreased as iteration number becomes 
larger, and 1c  and 2c  are two positive constants, generally set to 
be 2; rand and Rand are two functions randomized between the 
ranges [0, 1]. The velocity of each particle is clamped between its 
own limited ranges.

Abstract-- One of the major problems in development of
distributed generation (DG) is voltage control derived from
reverse power. In order that voltage variation may not degrade
customer voltage supply quality, feeder voltage should be
maintained within the permissible range against DG connection.
To improve the voltage profile in distribution network with DG,
this paper proposes several voltage control strategies that
incorporate existing voltage control device and reactive power
compensator. Various degrees of integration ranging from a
simple local based control of generation to a coordinated control
between distribution and generation facilities are introduced.
Their effects on voltage profile are tested and further on
penetration increment of DG are analyzed using a practical
distribution system.
Index Terms-- Distributed generation, Voltage control,
Coordinated control, and Permissible penetration.
I. INTRODUCTION
HE growth of distributed generation (DG) has increased
since the privatization of independent power producers
(IPPs) and is now being further encouraged by the
governments’ new energy policy that will demand new
thinking about energy supply to aim at creating a low carbon
economy [1,2]. The DG embraces all electricity generation
plants connected to a distribution network and many DG plants
employ smaller generators, producing electricity from
renewable energy sources, i.e. wind, hydro, biomass, solar, etc.
or are small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) plants.
These plants are often connected to essentially distribution
systems at 33kV and below [3].
Modern distribution systems are designed to accept bulk
power from the transmission network and to distribute it to
customers. Thus the flow of both real power and reactive
power was always from the higher to the lower voltage levels.
The behavior of the network is well understood and the
procedures for both design and operation long established.
However, with significant penetration of DG the power flows
may become reversed and the distribution network is no longer
a passive circuit supplying loads but an active system with

power flows and voltages determined by the generation as well
as the loads. Thus the power flows through the circuits may be
in either direction depending on the relative magnitudes of the
real and reactive network loads compared to the generator
outputs and any losses in the network and the voltage profile
that significantly depends on the power flows is also changed.
This in turn will lead to significant changes for voltage control
mechanism in the electricity distribution networks [4-6].
Each utility or every distribution network operator has an
obligation to supply its customers at a voltage within specified
limits. This requirement often determines the design and
expense of the distribution circuits and so, many techniques
have been developed to make the maximum use of distribution
circuits to supply customers within the required voltages.
However, existing distribution networks have not been
designed to accept extensive DG. New technical challenges are
presented in accommodating DG onto the networks without
incurring high reinforcement costs, and in ensuring that
existing load customers are not adversely affected.
In the existing distribution networks, there are a number of
voltage control devices and reactive power compensation
equipment that can be used for optimum voltage control
against the penetration of DG. Addition to the existing control
devices, various types of DG with advanced voltage control
capability are emerged and can also be used for the control
purpose. Therefore, most attention has been paid to develop an
effective coordination approach to deal with these. In general,
the approach adopted has been to ensure that any DG does not
reduce the quality of supply offered to other customers and all
possible operation costs are minimized. Through the
coordinated or distributed voltage controls, the overall voltage
quality of a distribution system with a significant penetration
of DG generation may be optimized and the permissible level
of penetration of DG can be further increased.
To accommodate the voltage variations due to DG
penetration, many approaches based on coordinated controls
have been proposed [7-10]. A technique that combines genetic
algorithm and Tabu search is presented in [7] to determine
optimal operation for distribution voltage control with
coordination of various voltage control devices. [8] proposed a
coordinated voltage control method with on-load tap changer
(OLTC), substation switched capacitors, and feeder-switched
capacitors to obtain optimum voltage and reactive power

3It is important to observe that the real part of the network
impedance, R, determined by conductor size is critical for the
amount of generation that can be connected under DG
operation with a unity power factor. Furthermore, since the
probability of such extreme situation of coincidence of
minimum load with maximum generation actually occurring is
generally low, and hence it may be beneficial to accommodate
a larger DG and curtail it when voltage at busbar to be
connected rises to that of the limit.
III. EFFECTS OF VOLTAGE AND REACTIVE POWER
MANAGEMENTS ON DG PERMISSIBLE PENETRATION
The maximum permissible level of penetration of DG in (3)
is based on the assumption of a unity power factor. However,
from a practical operation point of view, the overall system to
operate with a unity power factor is really difficult. So, the
capacity of DG that can be connected under minimum load can
be expressed as follows:
R

R

DG 
 (4)
where )QQQ(Q CLDGimport  is the net reactive
power.
From (4), it can be seen that for a distribution system the
line impedance (R+jX) is known and assumed to be constant,
the maximum permissible level of penetration of DG can be
increased with an increase in importQ or a reduction in Vi
based on the voltage limit at busbar to be connected ( maxDGV ).
Thus, the voltage profile can be improved through the voltage
and reactive power managements for increasing the
permissible penetration of DG. Based on (4), the proposed
voltage control strategies are expressed as follows.
A. Control-I: Reactive Control
Effect of reactive power control on network voltage and
penetration of DG is significant, especially for overhead
distribution line. If importQ is absorbed from the network and
is maximum ( maximportQ ) through the controls of DG with
voltage control capability and reactive power compensator, the
capacity of DG that can be connected is expressed as follows:
R
XQ
R

From (5), it is shown that the net reactive power
significantly depends on the image part of the line impedance,
X, the reactive compensation effect is more obvious when a
greater X is considered. Therefore, this control method is more
effective for overhead distribution lines than underground lines
because of the X of overhead line is about 4 times compared to
underground lines. When a larger penetration of DG is
considered, the net reactive power absorbed from the network
should be increased for maintaining the voltages within the
permissible limit. But it is noted that more reactive power
flows will lead to greater line losses, the line losses should be
considered in the assessment of this control method.
B. Control-II: Voltage Control
With the existing voltage control devices in distribution
networks, the voltage at bus i can be minimum ( miniV )for
allowing a greater level of penetration of DG. Various types of
voltage control devices such as OLTC, voltage regulator, and
capacitor banks can employed for this purpose. The
mathematic expression of effect of the voltage control on the
maximum penetration of DG is shown as follows:

Voltage control is usually based on a simple constant
voltage policy or a scheme that takes into account circuit
loading while determining the voltage that should be
maintained. It is important to bear in mind that this voltage
control strategy was designed for passive networks with
strictly unidirectional power flows. In active distribution
networks with multi-directional power flows, the validity of
this local control voltage practice becomes inherently
inadequate. Therefore, alternative voltage control practices
that go beyond the present local voltage control, such as an
area-based control of OLTC can be considered and the
benefits of such strategy can be really quantified. This type of
coordinated control is generally accompanied with an adequate
communication system and measurements from a number of
points along the feeder [1].
C. Control-III: Coordinated Voltage and Reactive Controls
The third control strategy is to combine the voltage and
reactive power controls through a coordinated control between
distribution and generation facilities. Because the voltage and
reactive power are together controlled, this control strategy is
more effective and its effect on penetration of DG is more
significant. The mathematic equation for this control strategy
is shown as follows:

This coordinated system voltage and reactive power control
may be implemented either using central distribution
management system (DMS) controllers or by distributing the
control functions among the various controllers associated
with each item of plant, i.e. generators, tap-changers.
Therefore, the overall control system can be arranged in a
hierarchy with the controllers. Since the implementation is
largely for the requirement of communication between the
various items of plant, more attentions must be paid to the
consequences of failure of the communications on the system

Table III (a) and (b) show that the effect of Control-I
(reactive power control) on different levels of penetration of
DG under WT to operate with constant power factors of 0.95
leading and lagging, respectively. From Table III (a), it can be
seen that because of WT to operate with a leading power
factor, the WT reactive power output is exported into the
network and thus the voltage is raised when an increase in
penetration of WT. This voltage raise effect during light
loading period is more significant than that for heavy loading
period. With the reactive power control, the voltage raise
problem due to DG connection can be improved. Using the
permissible range of voltage (0.95 p.u.~1.05p.u.) as a
reference, the capacity of reactive power compensation (QC)
absorbed from the network should be increased with an
increase in penetration of DG. When PDG is increased from 1
MW to 15 MW, QC are increased from 0 MVAr to -4.5 MVAr
and from 0 MVAr to -5.1 MVAr under heavy and light
loading periods for maintaining all bus voltages within the
predefined limit, respectively. This means that if permissible
level of penetration of WT is 15 MW, the capacities of the
reactive power compensator could be 4.5 MVAr and 5.1
MVAr under heavy and light loading periods. This is useful
for planning and scheduling operation of reactive power
compensators. Furthermore, it can be seen from Table III (a)
that the line losses are increased with an increase in
penetration of WT. When PDG is increased from 1 MW to 15
MW, the line losses are increased from 0.067 MW to 2.149
MW and from 0.012 MW to 2.410 MW during heavy and light
loading periods, respectively. From the test results, it has been
seen that the line loss for heavy loading period is greater than
that for light loading period when the penetration of WT is
less. This is because at this time the reactive power
compensator is not to operate. When a larger amount of
penetration of DG is considered, the reactive power exchange
between the WT and distribution system and reverse power
during light loading period are larger than those for heavy
loading period and consequently the line loss during light
loading period is larger than that for heavy loading period.

(A) PF=0.95 LEADING
(B) PF=0.95 LAGGING
Similar test results are shown in Table III (b) that the WT is
to operate with a lagging power factor. Main difference
between Table III (a) and (b) is that for an operation with a
lagging power factor, the reactive power is absorbed by WT
from the network. Therefore, for a large penetration of WT,
the voltage will be declined and at this time a more output
should be exported from the reactive power compensator into
the network. From Table III (b), it can be seen that when PDG
is increased from 1 MW to 15 MW, cQ are increased from 0
MVAr to 3.2 MVAr and from 0 MVAr to 2.6 MVAr during
heavy and light loading periods, respectively. The line losses
of 0.072 MW and 0.011 MW are changed to 2.55 MW and
2.86 MW. This is because the voltage decline effect for heavy
loading is more significant than for light loading period when
WT is running with a lagging power factor. From Table III (a)
and (b), it is indicated that the proper reactive power control
strategy can effectively manage the voltage to gain flexibility
of incorporating DG. The test results can be used as references
for future reactive power compensator planning.
The voltage can also be improved with the existing voltage
control devices in distribution networks (Control-II) and test
results are shown in Table IV (a) and (b), which depict the WT
to operate with leading and lagging power factor, respectively.
In the test, the tap changer of OLTC is adjusted based on the
variation in controlled voltage at bus B0 ( 0BV ) due to DG
