一、前言
近年來研究製程的統計製程管制(SPC)已從過去著重於偵測產品是否偏離規範能力提
昇到是否能迅速有效診斷製程發生變異的問題來源，為了要能有效辨識製程異常原因，
Woodall 與 Montgomery [6] 提出異常變異來源辨識(Variation Source Identification)
是 SPC 未來一項重要的研究方向。在現今製程中，不論是連續生產過程或自動化裝配生產
以及檢驗等，製程的複雜度日漸提升，製程或品質變數並不完全獨立，如果把這些變數視
為獨立而分別監控，會增加誤判的機率。因為同時監控數個生產或品質變數已成了必然的
趨勢，因此利用多變量統計製程管制(Multivariate Statistical Process Control,
MSPC) ，從製程中同時去蒐集數個資料，並加以分析與探索出製程的異常，立即採取修正
行動，使製程恢復正常，對產業界是非常重要的工作[5]。以異常形態分類( Variation
Patterns Classification, VPC)比對為基礎的變異來源辨識方法，指所蒐集監控製程參數
或品質特性之偏差數據(X=[x1,x2,…,xn]T)是製程中出現某些異常表現 (Z=[z1,z2,…,zq])
與誤差(w)所造成，因此監控多變量資料的變異與製程中的異常問題之間會存在某種關係模
型，如公式(1)所示。
 wZgX  (1)
在 VPC 的方法中，假設 A=[a1,a2,a3,…,aq] 是存在於製程中可能發生變異的異常問題，
為有效能順利從所蒐集監控製程參數或品質特性之偏差數據比對出是由那些製程中某些異
常問題所造成，我們可以利用一個線性模式來表達此一關係，如公式(2)所示。
wZAX  (2)
我們可藉由分析公式(2)的線性故障異常-品質模型來比對出製程之變化是由那些異常
形態之問題所造成，由於此方法的穩健性，因此最進國外多變量故障異常診斷的研究已逐
漸朝向異常形態比對的方法。上述線性故障異常-品質模型可從分析製程共變異數的主要成
份推導出來，雖然此一線性模式提供有用的連結來描述變異來源與產品品質的關係，然而，
對於一個大型系統，要建立一個有效的線性異常故障-品質模型，必須要能徹底了解製程的
物理特性才能建立有效此一模型，通常這是一件非常困難事情[2]。資料導向模式是一種無
需透過製程的專業知識與經驗即可建立 A 矩陣係數的方法，其方式是經由調查探索歷史資
料的形態來估算 A矩陣的係數。
本研究主要目的在以資料為導向的 VPC 模式中，能快速有效決定異常形態矩陣(A)，即
當異常形態矩陣(A)無法在事先離線狀態下由製程知識中獲得時，如何能在線上監控情況下
於基板上相對應的位置，IC 封裝用載板(IC Substrate)間，有很大變化，需要很好的對位
技術，因此平面上 X、Y 方向置放精準度是非常重要，焊錫面與零件面對位偏差
(misregsitration )，常會造成元件對不準現象，其所導致元件對不準發生原因有基板調
整不良、膏狀焊料不足、基板調整不良與刮板中心點等問題，透過採用影像自動量測置放
偏移量可以掌握發生異常原因，假設我們監控一個 IC 的 20 點 X、Y 方向偏移量，A1 到 A4
異常對應 20 個監控變數的變化行為，圖 2 說明形態變化，表 1 說明 IC 對位偏移異常矩陣

5、結論
本研究用獨立成份分析法，由信號估測出獨立成份信號，進而獲得以獨立成份為基底
的特徵，以做為線性異常故障-品質模型。實驗結果得知，對於 4 種不同的 IC 對位偏移異
常類型，在使用 4 個獨立成份信號時，整體對位偏移異常矩陣準確度可以達到 80%(除 A3
外)，這個令人深刻印象的結果顯示出，我們所提出的方法在估算異常(Z)與其形態矩陣(A)

Multiple Fault Diagnostics in Solder Paste Printing Process Using Blind
Separation Approach

Abstract: In this paper, a fault diagnosis and variation pattern identification method is presented based on
blind source separation (BSS) approach which is used to extract important information from the measured
data and estimate the variation pattern matrix in a solder paste printing process. BSS techniques provide the
basis for identifying the precise characteristics of each individual variation pattern in order to facilitate the
identification of their root causes. Measurements of mixed signals which collected from a simulated faulty
process are decomposed by independent component analysis (ICA) and results from a the simulated case
study show that ICA has ability to separate the original source signals from their mixtures and to identify
variation pattern characteristics by using frequency domain ICA analysis. The techniques studied in this
paper would benefit SMT research of correcting unidentified solder paste stenciling problems.

1. INTRODUCTION
Surface mount technology (SMT) is one of the important
techniques in the electronic industry. There are three major
consecutive manufacturing steps: (1) solder paste printing
(SPP), (2) component placement, and (3) solder reflow in an
automated surface mount assembly process. In the first step of
SPP process, the printing operation is performed by aligning
the stencil pattern figure over the appropriate component
substrate pads and a squeegee moves over the square from top
to bottom while the paste is squeezed through holes in a
stencil. The SPP is characterized by high process-noise levels,
and by requiring constant solder-paste volume deposition at
all times. The SPP requires close alignment of stencil
apertures with PCB pads. In order to achieve consistently high
paste print quality, the printer allows control of several
parameters, such as stencil XY offset, stencil orientation,
squeegee level, squeegee pressure and squeegee speed. After
the SPP operation, a solder paste inspection machine typically
a laser-optical device is used to take measurement of solder
paste volume at several locations along a rectangular region
on which an integrated circuit will be mounted later. In SMT
operations, the solder paste is measured in-process for 100%
of the boards produced, and the cured solder joints are
measured for nearly 100% of the boards. According to past
estimates, 50 to 70 percent of the total defects in surface-
mount assembly lines were related to the SPP, and
approximately 30 to 50% of the total manufacturing cost was
due to test and rework expenses (Pan, J. et. al. 1999, 2004; He
etc. 1998; Feldmann and Sturm, 1994).
Each fault in a printing machine produces vibrations with
distinctive characteristics that should be measured and
compared with reference ones in order to perform the fault
detection and diagnosis. Many factors would lead to faults and
affect the quality of the SPP, including squeegee pressure,
printing speed, solder paste viscosity and rheology, and air
temperature and humidity within the production environment.
Two common problems of lack or excess of solder paste
volume at each printing location around the rectangular
printing area will cause serious quality problems which can
prevent acceptable solder joints from being formed during the
third stage of solder reflow process.
In the 2D measurement system, a component is measured to
obtain detailed dimensional characteristics of solder leakage
outside predefined solder paste deposit areas at n different
locations on a single part as presented in Figure 1. For
example, let X = [x1, x2,, x20]' be a 20×1 random vector that
represents a set of n measured characteristics from the process.
Excess solder may cause short, represented by a positive
deviation. Lack solder might results in an open represented by
a negative deviation. As shown in figure 2, typical defective
solder paste deposits have some areas of the corresponding
pad without some coverage at all. Furthermore, some area of
the solder paste deposits has leaked out onto areas of board
outside its predefined pad. Apparently, this is problematic in
that when the solder is later reflowed, the solder will bubble in
places and leave some area of the metal pads without solder.
According to Himmelblau (1978), the term fault is generally
defined as a departure from an acceptable range of an
observed variable associated with a process. It is possible to
determine if more than one squeegee stroke exists from the
analysis of the 2D paste deposit offset data. Various
techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
(Kresta et al., 1991), Partial Least Squares (PLS) (Nomikos
and MacGregor, 1994), Principal Component Regression
(PCR) (Randall, 1997) have been proposed to solve the
problems of fault detection and diagnosis. In practice, it is
difficult to know a priori which set of conditions will be better
satisfied and, consequently, which method will be more
effective.

several major process factors including: squeegee angle,
squeegee pressure, printing speed, separation speed, cleaning
interval, stroke viscosity of solder paste, temperature of solder
paste, and humidity of solder paste etc. can cause printing
quality problems. The measurement data contains a wealth of
hidden diagnostic information concerning the numerous
variation sources that contribute to overall levels of process
variability. In the data-driven approaches, model matrix A is
estimated using available historical observations of X. This
research involves identifying the pattern vector blindly from
the on-line measurement data, without realizing the potential
patterns.

where p=Diag{1, 2,, d} and Zp=[z1,z2,zp] are the p
largest eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors. Prior
works related to this objective included J&W method
(Johnson and Wichern, 1998) and A&S method (Apley and
Shi, 2001). In the J&W method, the varimax optimization
criterion is applied to produce an estimate of A whose
elements are either large in magnitude or small in magnitude,
with as few moderate sized elements as possible, it searches
for an estimate of A whose structure is as close as possible to
what is referred to as the ideal varimax structure shown as in
Equation (3).

The interpretation of (4) is that there exists a subset of n1
measurements {x1, x2,, xn1} that are affected by only a
single variation source, which will be called as the first source.
The effects of the first source on the first measurement subset
are represented by xn1. There must also exist a second subset
of n2 measurements {xn1+1, xn1+2,, xn1+n2} that are affected by
only one of the remaining p−1 variation sources, which will
be called as the second source. Consider the SPP problems
discussed in previous research (Gonzalez-Barreto, 1996), the
matrix A does not have the ideal varimax structure and ragged
lower triangular structure.
We use the BSS approach that aims at reconstructing both
unobserved input signals and the mixing-weights matrix from
the combined signals received at a given sequence of time
points. Recently, BSS by ICA has received attention because
of its potential advantages in signal processing such as in
speech recognition systems, telecommunications and medical
signal processing. In this paper, a fault diagnosis and variation
pattern identification method is presented based on ICA which
is used to extract important information from the measured
data and estimate the mixing matrix to become as the matrix A.
3. ICA METHODOLOGY
ICA has been used as a solution of the BSS problem
(Hyvärinen, and Oja., 2000) denoting the process of taking a
set of measured signal in a vector, X, and extracting from
them a new set of statistically independent components (ICs)
in a vector Y. Fig. 3 shows that n temporal independent
unknown variation source signals are linearly mixed in an
unknown system to produce a set of m measured output
signals.
The elements aij of the matrix A are constant coefficients that
give the mixing weights which are assumed to be unknown. A
is called a mixing matrix. A BSS problem is to separate
original sources from observed mixtures of the variation
sources, while blind means that knowledge about the original
sources and about the mixture is unknown. The problem
becomes of estimating the matrix A using only information
contained in the mixtures from x1 to xm. Methods of solving
this problem are known as BSS techniques which are the
separation of a set of signals from a set of mixed signals.

Figure 3. The schematic diagram of BSS for mixtures signal
of measurement
Figure 3 illustrates how the BSS for mixtures can be
formulated. Assuming we have N source signal fi(t) that are
mixed and observed at M sensors as xj(t), thus mathematically
we can write:
 

N
1i
j ,...,1),1()((t)x
l
iji Mjtfla (5)
Where j,i represent the impulse response from source i to
sensor j. It’s always assumed that the number of sources N is
known or can be estimated and the number of sensors M is
equal to or greater than N; NM  . The mixed signal X is
passed through the separation system which consists of finite
impulse response (FIR) filters wij(l) of length l to produce N
separated signals yi(t) as the output. Thus;

The separation filters, wij(l) should be estimated blindly, i.e.,
without any knowledge of the source signal fi(t) or the mixing
function aji(t). The matrix W, called as the estimated unmixing
matrix, reveals the original variation sources. The problem
comes out to the estimation of the coefficient matrix W. The
254
possesses neither the ideal varimax structure as equation (3)
nor the structure as equation (4) required in the A&S method.

The case study assumes that unknown number of variation
sources associate with the variation patterns. Before using any
of the ICA algorithms it is useful to do some data pre-
processing for simplifying and reducing the complexity of the
data. The performance index J (Lee and Apley, 2004) was
used to evaluate the methods. This index is defined as the
expected norm of the actual error ||ˆ||/||]ˆ[|| iiii bbbbE  as
the measure of performance for estimating the ith pattern
vector, where iii aab ˆ/ˆˆ and iii aab / are the directions
of iaˆ and ia . For the purpose of interpreting the nature of the
ith variation pattern, the direction of ia is more important than
the magnitude. Hence, we report only the directional error
values. The magnitude of ia is related to the severity of the
pattern. The average value of ||ˆ|| ii bb  over a Monte Carlo
simulation with 100 replicates was used to approximate Ji.
Using the FastICA and JADE algorithm to perform ICA and
Table 2 demonstrates that the FastICA performs better than
the JADE.

Another quantitative index for measuring ICA performance is
the Amaridemixer’s performancewhich is computed as:

where P = {pij}= WA The performance index is a measure
of the diagonality of matrix P (Haykin, 1999). If the matrix P
is perfectly diagonal, PI = 0. In this case study, the
performance index is around 0. In order to estimate the
mixing matrix effectively for inferring the variation patterns,
we need to characterize the time and frequency domain
behaviour of observing signals (X) and estimated ICs (y).
Assume that the original faulty signals fi are stationary, and
then the linear combinations of mixed measuring signals xi
can be trailed as stationary. Since each independent
component has its unique base band spectrum, the linear
combinations of band spectrum under specific characteristic
points from the Fourier transform of estimated independent
signals can represent the corresponding band spectrum in the
same characteristic points for the Fourier transform of
observed measuring signals. Observing the peak points from
the FFT diagram (Figure 4), we took the spectrum magnitude
at specific characteristic sampling peak points as the band
spectrum for formulating sets of linear equation systems to
model frequency domain of ICA.

Table 3 shows the spectrum magnitude at four specific
characteristic sampling points. The spectrum of the mixed
signal x1 can be convoluted from the spectrum of estimated
signal y1, y2, y3 and y4 by the following linear equation system:
