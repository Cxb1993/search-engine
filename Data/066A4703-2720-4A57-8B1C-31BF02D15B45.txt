reactors were modeled by combinations of ideal 
reactors with exchange flow among them (Tavare, 
1986; Franck et al., 1988; Bohlin and Rasmuson, 
1996; Shiau and Lu, 2006). In the 
above-mentioned models the particles were 
assumed to move along with the fluid in the 
vessel. However, in a real crystallizer the flow 
behavior of the particle phase might be different 
from that of the fluid phase. Often the internal 
exchange stream in a real crystallizer gives rise to 
classified crystals removal due to the particle 
gravity. It leads to the situation that in the internal 
mixing flow larger particles tend to travel along 
with downward flow while smaller particles tend 
to travel along with upward flow. Subsequently, 
if the product discharge is near the bottom of a 
vessel, then large crystals are preferentially 
removed. On the other hand, if the product 
discharge is near the top, then small crystals are 
preferentially removed (Randolph and Larson, 
1988).  
In this paper, a model will be proposed to 
study nonhomogeneous suspension of crystals 
due to the particle gravity in a continuous stirred 
crystallizer. The model equations, including the 
population balance equations and the mass 
balance equations, will be solved simultaneously 
to predict the resulting crystal size distribution 
(CSD) for power law growth and nucleation 
kinetics. The simulation results of this model can 
provide essential information for the design of a 
nonideal, continuous-stirred crystallizer. 
 
2 The model 
Consider a continuous stirred crystallizer 
equipped with an axial-flow impeller. In this 
model, the tank is divided into two well-mixed 
regions. The upper region is denoted as “R1” and 
the lower region is denoted as “R2” with the 
exchange stream between “R1” and “R2”. Due to 
the particle gravity, in the internal mixing flow 
larger particles tend to travel along with 
downward flow while smaller particles tend to 
travel along with upward flow. Thus, the 
exchange stream between “R1” and “R2” results 
in classified crystals removal. 
The δ1（L）unction is defined as the ratio of 
classified crystals removal at size L to perfectly 
mixed crystals removal in the exchange stream 
from “R1” to “R2” and is given by  
 
1φ

mLL >  
Similarly, the δ2（L）function is defined as 
the ratio of classified crystals removal at size L to 
perfectly mixed crystals removal in the exchange 
stream from “R2” to “R1” and is given by  
 
1

for 
mLL >  
 
In case , feed flow connects to “R1” while Ⅰ
product flow connects to “R2” (see Figure 1). In 
the development of the model, it is assumed that: 
(1) there is no crystal in the feed flow to the 
crystallizer; (2) crystal aggregation and crystal 
breakage is negligible; (3) nuclei are born at 
near-zero size; (4) the fluid phase and the particle 
phase are perfectly mixed in “R1” and “R2”, 
respectively; (5) the temperature is uniformly 
distributed in the whole crystallizer; (6) the 
product flow is perfectly mixed crystals removal; 
(7) the exchange stream between “R1” and “R2” 
is classified crystals removal, as described by 
Eqs.(1-2). 
Based on the concept of the population 
balance (Hulburt and Katz ,1964; Randolph and 
Larson, 1988), the steady-state population 
balance in “R1” is

The steady-state population balance in “R2” is 
60~1=β  for Case I as small crystals tend to 
stay in “R1” and large crystals tend to stay in 
“R2”. However, both 1L  and 2L  remains 
smaller than idealL , which is the resulting mean 
size for the ideal MSMPR case. Figures 3(c) 
shows that 1CV  always remains greater than 
2CV  at various α  in the range 60~1=β  for 
Case I. Besides, 2L  and 2CV  slightly increases 
as β  is increased. A similar trend is observed 
for Case II in Figures 4(b) and 4(c). As 
idealLL <2  with idealCVCV <2  for Case I and 
idealLL <1  with idealCVCV <1  for Case II, both 
cases result in a product with a smaller mean size 
and a smaller coefficient of variation compared to 
the ideal MSMPR case. Only one exception 
found in the simulation is idealCVCV >1  at 
25.0=α  and 60=β  for Case II. In general, 
Case I results in a product with a greater mean 
size and a smaller coefficient of variation 
compared to Case II. For example, 2L  = 322 
and 5414.02 =CV  at 5.0=α  and 30=β  for 
Case I while 1L  = 287 and 4243.01 =CV  at 
5.0=α  and 30=β  for Case II, as opposed to 
471=idealL  and 5.0=idealCV  for the ideal 
MSMPR case. 
Figure 3(d) shows that 2,TM  is nearly 
equal to idealTM ,  and always greater than 1,TM  
at various α  in the range 60~1=β  for Case 
I. On the other hand, Figure 4(d) shows that 
1,TM  is nearly equal to idealTM ,  and always 
smaller than 2,TM  at various α  in the range 
60~1=β  for Case II. Thus, the production rate 
for both cases is nearly the same as that for the 
ideal MSMPR case. 
4 Conclusions 
A model is proposed to study 
nonhomogeneous suspension of crystals due to 
the particle gravity in a continuous stirred 
crystallizer. The simulation results show that the 
crystal mean size and the suspension density in 
the lower region is greater than that in the upper 
region. Compared to the ideal MSMPR case, 
nonhomogeneous suspension of crystals results 
in a product with a smaller mean size and a 
smaller coefficient of variation for particle 
removal either in the lower region or in the upper 
region. In general, particle removal in the lower 
region gives rise to a product with a greater mean 
size and a smaller coefficient of variation 
compared to particle removal in the upper region. 
However, the production rate for both cases is 
nearly the same as that for the ideal MSMPR 
case.
