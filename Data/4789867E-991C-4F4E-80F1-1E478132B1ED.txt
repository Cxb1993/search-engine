formed by tesseracts ("four-dimensional cubes") into three dimensional space does the trick. The model based 
on this was baptised FCHC-model (it makes use of the 'Face Centered Hyper-Cubic' lattice [10]). It has been 
validated both by theory and by numerical experiments [11].  
More recently "thermal" models have been developed, this designation is justified both by the 
introduction of a number of absolute velocities different from one and by the addition of an energy 
conservation law independent from mass conservation. These models are the object of a thermo-dynamical 
study (sometimes with surprising results: as an example, one can determine that mechanical pressure and 
thermo-dynamical pressure are only equivalent for low densities in these models!) [12, 13].  
This was but a short glimpse of the possibilities offered by lattice gas automata. There is already 
abundant literature about them (let us cite only references [14-16]), as they are a promising class of models to 
study both theoretical tools and "experimental" set-ups.

Boundary condition commonly used at solid wall is the no-slip condition for which velocities vanish at 
the wall. A bounce-back assumption may be simple but is very useful. It suggests that, for the nodes at the no 
slip wall, particles moving towards the wall should move back to the original node at the next time step with 
opposite direction after collision with the wall. 
For fluid flows within the micro-scale device, such as micro-channel, the continuum assumption, which 
is the basic assumption for the Naiver-Stoke equation, will break down, and the slip boundary condition will 
replace the no-slip boundary condition at the solid wall boundaries.  
For a system with Kn < 0.001, the fluid flow can be treated as continuum. For Kn > 10 the system can be 
considered as a free-molecular flow. The fluid flow for 0.001 < Kn < 10, which often appears in the MEMS, 
can not be treated as a continuum flow or a free molecular flow. To solve such flow field numerically, the 
traditional CFD methods are not suitable due to the rarefaction and discontinuity of fluid flow. While the 
lattice Boltzmann method, which is based on the particle approach, has the potential and ability to solve the 
flow fileds. Lim et al. [18] and Nie et al. [19] have proposed two different schemes to determine the 
dimensionless relaxation time τ in Lattice Boltzmann Method by two kinds of possible relations between Kn 
and τ. 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
  The test case of a cubic cavity flow is a classic benchmark for which many simulation results exist in the 
literature shown as Figure 2, used 60-cubic lattices. The model problem consists of a cubic cavity with a 
constant velocity moving top lid. The cavity is filled with an incompressible viscous fluid. In addition, 
previous study also has D2Q9 model data available for comparison. 
    Figure 3 demonstrates the typical test of dimensions (D2Q9 and D3Q19) by comparing the velocity 
profiles (Re=1,000) at the centerline of the cavity with the data by Ghia et al. [12], which has been considered 
to be the most comprehensive computation for the impressible lid-driven cavity flow. The average error is 
0.41% for Reynolds numbers of Re = 1000 between D2Q9 and D3Q19. Thus, all results discussed in the cubic
