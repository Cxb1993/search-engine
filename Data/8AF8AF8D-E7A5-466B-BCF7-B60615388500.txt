2vice versa. Ignoring these effects could lead to errors in estimating aquifer properties
based on tidal signals.
Li and Jiao (2001a,b) developed an analytical solution for a coastal aquifer
system in response to tidal fluctuation considering both storage and leakage in semi-
pervious layer. Their results show that the impact of storativity of semi-permeable
layer on groundwater-head fluctuation is negligible only when the storativity of semi-
permeable layer is comparable to or smaller than of the confined aquifer.
Chuang and Yeh (2007) developed a mathematical model to investigate the
effects of tidal fluctuations and leakage on the groundwater head of leaky confined
aquifer extending an infinite distance under the sea. They showed that the leakages of
the offshore and inland aquitards are two dominant factors controlling the
groundwater fluctuation. Chuang and Yeh (2008) is derived a analytical solution to
describe groundwater level fluctuation in a leaky aquifer extending finite distance
under the sea. They found the joint effects of various parameters, such as the dynamic
effect of water table fluctuation and the leakages of the inland and offshore, on the
behavior of the groundwater level fluctuations in the inland part of the leaky confined
aquifer.
The objective of this paper is to develop a new analytical solution for a costal
aquifer system, which a leaky confined aquifer is separated by an aquitard from an
unconfined aquifer. The leakage through aquitard was considered proportional to
differences between head in confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer. This new
solution is diferent from Li et al.’s solution (2001) because nonlinear Boussinesq
equation was considered for unconfined aquifer. The results were compared to other
researcher’s results.
Problem setup and boundary conditions
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a costal aquifer system, the leaky
confined aquifer, aquitard, and unconfined aquifer. Both of confined and unconfined
aquifer materials are isotropic and homogenous; the flow velocity is essentially
horizontal in both aquifers. There is a vertical leakage through the aquitard, it is
assumed that storage in aquitard is negligible. The origin of x- axis is located at the
intersection of the aquifers and the beach face. The x- axis is positive landward, and
perpendicular to the coastal line. The aquifers are infinite in y- direction and semi-
infinite in x direction. Considering nonlinear Boussinesq equation for unconfined
aquifer, and assuming the leakage is linearly proportional to differences between
heads in confined and unconfined aquifer, governing equation for this case will be as

Conclusion
An analytical solution was developed to investigate groundwater fluctuation for
a coastal aquifer system, containing unconfined aquifer, aquitard, and confined
aquifer, based on perturbation method. In this study head fluctuation in both confined
and unconfined aquifer was considered. This analytical solution was derived based on
nonlinear Boussinesq equation for unconfined aquifer, and the leakage between two
aquifers is proportional to head differences between the two aquifers. In previous
studies solution for a coastal aquifer system had been obtained based on linearised
equation for unconfined aquifer (Li et al. 2001, Jeng et al. 2002). The solution was
compared with those developed by Parlange et al., (1984), Li et al., (2001), Song et
al., (2007). The comparison showed that present solution results are acceptable.

ABSTRACT
A solution is developed to investigate the influences of leakage and soil parameters
on tidal response in a coupled coastal aquifer system consisting of an overlying phreatic
aquifer, an underlying confined aquifer, and a semi-permeable layer between them. These
two aquifers interact with each other through leakage. The confined aquifer is
impermeable at the bottom and connected with the sea freely while the phreatic aquifer
has a free surface and is represented by the nonlinear Boussinesq equation. The effects of
tidal fluctuations on both the phreatic and the confined aquifer are considered. This
solution is different from the ones of Li et al. (2001, Tidal fluctuations in a leaky confined
aquifer: dynamic effects of an overlying phreatic aquifer. Water Resour Res 2001; 37(4):
1095-8) and Jeng et al. (2002, Analytical solution for tidal propagation in a coupled
semi-confined/phreatic coastal aquifer. Advances in Water Resources 2002; 25: 577-84) in
which they used confined flow equation to approximate the Boussinesq equation. Based
on the solution, the effect of leakage on the behaviour of the groundwater level
fluctuations in the leaky confined aquifer can be clearly and accurately explored.
CE Database subject headings: tidal fluctuation; leaky aquifer; Boussinesq equation
Under these assumptions the governing equations of the head fluctuation in both
aquifers are [Bear and Verruijt, 1987, Parlange et. al., 1984]

Root objects are then approximated numerically for precision coefficients.
Condition estimates for Vandermonde systems governing the coefficients yield
the precision to take in approximating the roots numerically.
Specialized solvers for nonconfluent Vandermonde systems are then used to
solve equations for the coefficients.
One step of iterative refinement is used to polish the approximate solutions and
to check that the coefficients are obtained to the requested precision.
This generates the coefficients for Implicit Runge-Kutta method to 20-decimal
digits of precision. In many engineering problems, the nonlinear Boussinesq equation
for related mathematical model is tractable. Yet the corresponding solution in the
analytical solution may not be possible or easily be solved. Under such circumstances,
methods of numerical solution such as the Implicit Runge-Kutta method can be employed.
The numerical solution of (1) and (7) were evaluated by using the Implicit Runge-Kutta
method, which is based on the Mathematica software [Mathematica, 2007].
NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The amplitude (A) of groundwater fluctuations and the temporal (T) head fluctuation
by the sea tide change with the conductivity, storativity and transmissivity in the
phreatic and confined aquifer. A hypothetical case is used to demonstrate how
analytical equations influence tidal fluctuations. The following parameter values are
used: K = 10 m/day; ne = 0.1; S2 = 0.001; T2 = 100 m/day; L = 0, A0 = 3 m; D = 10 m,
and ω = 0.2618 /day.When L = 0 (no leakage), Eq. (1), (2) and Eq. (3) are not
coupled. The amplitude of hydraulic head in the leaky aquifer is not influenced by the
amplitude of hydraulic head in the phreatic aquifer. On the basis of Eq.(1) ~ (7), the
curves of (a) amplitude and temporal head fluctuation in the phreatic aquifer and (b)
those in the leaky aquifer versus distances from the coast are presented in Fig. 2. The
amplitude decreases exponentially with distance from the coast. As shown in Fig. 2,
in the phreatic aquifer, the amplitude becomes zero about 600m, but in the leaky
aquifer, the amplitude is still > 0 at the distance of over 3000m. Fig. 3 also used the
parameter values: L = 0 (no leakage); K = 10 m/day; ne = 0.1; S2 = 0.001; T2 = 100
fluctuations in the leaky confined aquifer can be explored.
Two hypothetical cases are chose to explore the influence of leakage and different
analytical equation on the tidal fluctuation in the phreatic aquifer and leaky aquifer.
From these cases, the amplitude and the phase shift of head fluctuation in the phreatic
aquifer considering confined flow equation are greater than ones considering
Boussinesq equation when leakage is equal zero or 0.01 /day. These Cases
illustrates that both tidal amplitude of hydraulic head in the leaky aquifer and the
distance over which the aquifer influenced by the seawater can be significantly
decreased because of leakage. They also show that the hydraulic head fluctuation in
the leaky aquifer approach to the hydraulic head fluctuation in the Phreatic aquifer
considering confined flow equation or Boussinesq equation, as the leakage increases.
Obviously, the solution presented here can be also applied to two hydraulic connected
leaky aquifers, while the fluctuations in Phreatic aquifer considering confined flow
equation or Boussinesq equation.
