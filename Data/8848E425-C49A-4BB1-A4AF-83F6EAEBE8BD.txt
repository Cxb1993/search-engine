2fatigue failure of the device. It is well known to fatigue community that fatigue
failure of metals is caused by cyclic plastic deformation.  Since the device is so
designed to dissipate earthquake energy by large plastic deformation, it is believed
that the device may eventually fail because of fatigue fracture.  This study performs
a systematic fatigue test and analysis of the device, including the fatigue failure of the
device by constant amplitude loads (CAL), SAC loads, and the variable amplitude
loads (VAL).  The specimens fractured by the SAC loads and VAL are further
analyzed by the Palmgrem-Miner’s rule so that the damage value at failure of the
specimens is given for a fatigue design of the device.
There is an additional goal of the study.  An important issue has been raised
since the 1994 Northridge earthquake for steel structures, that is, fatigue cracks
without significant plastic deformation are found in the region of the complicated
welded beam-column connections.  Fatigue design of the connection may provide a
solution to the problem.  The geometry and stress states of the connection are so
complex and the fatigue analysis is certainly difficult.  As compared to the
beam-column connections, the ADAS plates are much simple and hence the fatigue
studies of the device are much simple and may offer useful experience toward to the
fatigue design of the complex beam-column connections.
Palmgren-Miner’s Damage Concept in Fatigue [12,13]
When a component is subjected to CAL with a stress range S and the
corresponding fatigue life is known as N.  The damage Di caused by the ith cycle is
defined as 1/N.  Hence, the component is failed when the damage value equals to 1.
This concept has been extended to components subjected to block loads (BL) and
VAL. Because these loads contain cycles of variable amplitude, the S-N curve
(stress range and fatigue life relationship obtained from the CAL tests) is required so
that damage caused by each loading cycle of the BL or VAL can be calculated.
Numerous studies have shown that the total damage at failure for BL or VAL is
not necessarily equals to 1 depending on the type of load and component material.
For example, Omer [14] tested aluminum alloy for low-high and high-low BL and
found that for the low-high BL the damage value at failure is larger than 1 and the
high-low BL is smaller than 1. From the intense studies regarding the damage value
used in the fatigue community, it is obvious that when the damage concept is intended
to be used for the design of ADAS device or the welded beam-column connections,
the total damage value at failure of these components subjected to earthquake loads is
required.
The Test Program
The Specimen and the Test Setup
The ADAS device used in construction practice usually contains several pieces
of steel plate.  When the device is subjected to cyclic loads, fatigue cracks can be
initiated at sites of different plates.  During the early stage when the crack size is not
large, the cracks propagate independently in different rates, indicating that the fatigue
life of each plate is different and the difference is especially significant for high cycle
fatigue.  Although for the case of low cycle fatigue the difference is less significant,
but can still cause additional difficulty in determining the fatigue life of the device.
For example, it is possible to see that one or two steel plates have already been broken
but the whole device still continue to work.  To avoid the difficulty, it is decided to
fabricate the specimen with only one piece of steel plate. The specimen was made of
A36 steel with a yield stress y = 360 MPa and an ultimate stress u = 525 MPa.
4value at failure when the component is subjected to the SAC loads and the real
earthquake-induced VAL.
The SAC loads used in the test is obtained by assuming that the TADAS plate is
used in a building with a floor height of 3 m.  Figure 3 shows the loading history
expressed in the actuator displacement.  Due to the capacity limitation of the test
setup, a maximum displacement amplitude of 60 mm is used.  The entire loads are
termed as a loading block, which is repeatedly imposed on the specimens until failure
occurs.
The Earthquake-Induced VAL
One of the goals of this study is to calculate the damage value of the plate
subjected to building floor displacement history caused by earthquake loads.  The
floor displacement history is obtained from the structural dynamical simulations of a
one-bay, 3-story steel building.  The building is a full-scale benchmark structure
used in the National Center for Research of Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) of
Taiwan.  The mass, damping and stiffness matrices have already been identified and
reported:

The computer code ANSYS is used for the simulations. Assume that each floor of
the structure contains a piece of the current TADAS plate.  There is no TADAS
element provided in ANSYS, hence, to simulate the coupling responses of the
structure and steel plates, a finite element model for the elastic-plastic analysis of
TADAS plate must be constructed before the dynamical analysis.
Figure 4 shows the finite element meshes of the tested TADAS. The eight-node
hexahedral element is used in the model. Because the specimen is symmetric, only
half of the specimen is modeled.  On the symmetrical face, all the nodal
displacements are constrained in the transverse direction.  Due to connecting to the
actuator, all the nodes on the top face of the rigid steel block are constrained to the
actuator displacement along the longitudinal direction and to zero along the vertical
direction.  In the figure, a solid thick line is shown on the circular rod. All the
nodes on this thick line are also constrained depending on the actuator moving
direction.  If the actuator displacement is positive, these nodes are constrained due to
the rod is contacting with the steel blocks.  As the actuator displacement becomes
negative, the mentioned constrained nodes are released and the corresponding nodes
on the other side of the rod are constrained due to the contact of the rod with the steel
blocks on the other side.  When the actuator moves to a displacement, the reaction
force of the TADAS are acquired by the sum of all the reaction forces of the nodes on
6i.e., the failure of the specimen has occurred.  Hence, the fracture surfaces of these
two specimens were not able to be observed.
Figure 7(a) shows the fracture surface of specimen CAL8.  The five slots can be
seen with the corresponding pin rod breaking in the slots.  The rigid steel block
surface can also be seen.  The surface remains its original appearance with scratched
marks.  The marks are caused by the abrasive contact of the surface and the
triangular plate.  The presence of the surface indicates that the materials of the rigid
block and plate are not fully welded between the fractured pin rods, forming the lack
of penetration (LOP).  It is well known that LOP can be potential cracks causing the
failure of welded components.
Detail examinations of the crack path show that these cracks propagate toward
up into the weld metal since a slope can be seen in the weld metal region of the
fracture surface (see Figure 8(a)).  There is no crack propagation from a LOP into
the neighboring pin rod since there is an elevation difference between the LOP surface
and the rod fracture surface.  The fracture surface at the pin rods is relative flat when
compared to the surface usually observed in the monotonic tensile stress fracture.
Hence the pin rods are also fractured by fatigue cracks initiated from the weld toe
region (see Figure 8(b)). From the above observations, it is concluded that there are
two crack mechanisms forming the fracture surface of Specimen CAL8. Test results
show that there are other seven specimens failed in the manner identical to Specimen
CAL8 and are illustrated in Table 1.
 Specimens CAL6 and SAC3 show a different fracture surface and the surface of
SAC3 is shown in Figure 7(b).  The LOP faces are obviously absent and all the
fracture surface is formed by the cracks initiated from the weld toes.   Companying
the experience gained in examining the previously mentioned mixed mode crack faces,
it is believed that cracks caused by LOP coexist with the cracks from the weld toe
region, but the growth rate of the weld toe cracks is larger.  Hence, the toe cracks
propagated through the plate thickness earlier and the faces of these cracks are
revealed as the fracture surface.
If the fatigue life of one of the above mentioned cracks has a significant
difference from the other, the fracture surface of the specimens should show solely a
single type.  For instance, if the growth rate of the LOP cracks are much larger than
the growth rate of the weld-toe cracks, the LOP cracks should dominate the fatigue
behavior and all specimens should show a fracture surface mode as illustrated in
Figure 7(a).  Since a second type of fracture surface is present, postulating that the
LOP cracks and the weld-toe cracks are competing cracks and the fracture surface
feature of the specimens depends on the growth rate of the two cracks.  Figure 7(c)
shows the fracture surface of Specimen SAC2, in which the fracture surface is
categorized by the mixed crack mode face as shown in Table 1.  However, the
surface shows different features from the mentioned mixed crack mode face, that is,
there is only one LOP crack face, and the rest surface is formed by the weld toe cracks.
This surface confirms that the LOP and weld-toe cracks coexist in the specimens and
the failure of the specimens depends on the growth of the two types of crack.
Definition of Failure
Figures 9(a)-(d) show the measured hysteresis loops of the specimens tested at
constant amplitude with the displacement amplitudes of ±10, ±40, ±60 and ±80 mm,
respectively. In addition, the loops of Specimens SAC1 and VAL1 are illustrated in
Figures 9(e) and (f). The specimen tested at ±10 mm endured several thousand
cycles and the measured data are numerous, therefore, not all the measured loops are
8number is used instead of the cycle number.  Figure 11 shows the u–N curve on a
log-log plot using the CAL test data with the stated failure criterion. A regression
analysis is performed and a power exponent relationship for the u and N can be
obtained:
u = 622.3(N)-0.362. (4)
Cycle Counting and Damage Calculations
Before the Palmgren-Miner’s rule is used to calculate the damage value at failure,
the SAC and VAL cycle counting must be performed.  The rainflow counting method
proposed by Endo and Matsuishi is well accepted by the metal fatigue community and
has been adopted by the ASTM code [20].  Hence, the method is used for the present
study.
The method counts the loading cycle using the loading peak to valley and valley
to peak, in other words, the cycle count and corresponding range is performed half
cycle by half cycle.  Therefore, the counting results showing a half cycle are
permitted.  Using the SAC loading as an example (see Figure 3), it seems that there
are 6 cycles for the displacement from -11.25 to 11.25 mm. When the cycle
counting is performed, the results show that there are 5.5 cycles for the cycle range.
The ‘missing half cycle’ is counted as the range 26.25mm, that is, umin = -11.25 andumax = 15 mm.  Table 2 shows the counted cycles of the entire SAC loading block
used in the present study.  Cycle count is also performed for the VAL but the counts
are not shown because of the lengthy results.
Damage values at failure are calculated both for the SAC and VAL specimens
using the Palgrem and Miner’s rule and the regressed displacement-life relationship.
The calculated damage values are shown in Table 1.  For specimens SAC2 and
SAC3, the damage values are smaller than but very close to 1.  The value of
specimen SAC1 is lower than 1, but higher than those of the VAL specimens.  From
these results, it can be concluded that the damage value of the components subjected
to the present VAL is tended to be smaller than that subjected to the SAC loads,
indicating that using of the SAC loads for the earthquake fatigue analysis may be
resulted in essential differences for the damage value calculations.  In addition, using
a damage value of 1 for the life estimation of structural components subjected to real
earthquake loads may induce non-conservative results.
Conclusions
1. Although the TADAS plates may experience large plastic deformation, fatigue
cracks occurs at other locations such as the LOP or the weld toe rather than the plates
themselves.
2. Even the deformation of the plates is not large enough to cause energy dissipation,
fatigue failure can still occur due to the LOP cracks or the local plastic deformation in
the weld toe region.
3. The present study illustrates that the damage value at failure of the structural
components subjected to SAC loads may have an essential difference from that
subjected to the earthquake-induced VAL.
4. The damage value of 1 is inadequate for the fatigue design of the structural
components subjected to earthquake-induced VAL.  The present test results show
that a value as low as 0.5 is more promising.
