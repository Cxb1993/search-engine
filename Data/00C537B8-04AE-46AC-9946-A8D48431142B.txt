英文摘要： 
 
Owing to the dramatic cost down on electronic components and the advances on wireless 
technologies, the development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has drawn intensive 
attention in recent years from many countries. The Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is a 
promising approach for the future ITS. In this novel network architecture, a communication is 
either enable between the vehicle and road side unit (RSU) or between any two cars in 
multihop fashion. In other words, the deployment is flexible and the network 
coverage can be easily extended to wild range. 
However, due the potential interference problem in wireless carry, the network quality 
would be severely deteriorated. On the other head, the unique features in vehicular network 
could introduce more uncertainty to the performance. In this project, we developed 
multichannel architecture mechanisms to reduce the interference problem in VANET. 
    Besides, for mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), which is highly related to VANET, we 
proposed an adaptive power control protocol. The protocol can balance the power 
consumption between nodes and routes, and reduce the instability due to node mobility.

供了多重通道存取(Multi-channel Access)的基礎架構，將時間軸切分成數個同步區間(sync 
interval)，每個同步時間再分為控制區間(CCH Interval)以及服區間(SCH Interval)，車輛可於
CCH Interval 時，在 CCH 上協調下一個 SCH Interval 所需使用的 SCH，來減少彼此干擾
的機會。 
叢集化(clustering)為當前利用多重通道解決網線網路干擾問題的重要技術之一，其主要
概念是將數個鄰近的節點合併為一個叢集(cluster)，同一 cluster 內的車輛使用相同的 channel
以便於溝通，而 clusters 彼此之間則使用不同的 channel 以避免太多的干擾。然而，現有的
方法多半無法完全的滿足大量的車用網路應用，主要的因原就在於一般車輛都只裝載單一
天線(Single-radio)，同一時間只能存取一個通道，所有車必需在 CCH interval 切換到 CCH 
上才能確保控制及安全訊息都被完的收接，因此在 CCH interval 時，其餘 6 個 SCHs 的頻
寬是浪費的。如果過多的車輛於 CCH interval 送出控制訊息，也會造成 CCH 通道的擁塞，
進而影響 SCH interval 的傳輸。截至目前為止，已有相當多的研究針對此問題進行改進，
然而現有方法通常只是在細部參數進行調整，並無法完全解決 SCH 頻寬閒置的問題，或是
無法在完全利用頻寬的情況下，保證安全及控制訊息的接收。 
因此，本計畫提出了一個創新的多通道存取架構(Multi-channel Access Architecture)，此
架構利用裝載多天線(Multi-radio)的路側系統(Road Side Unit, RSU)為 cluster head，以利協調
不同通道上的訊息，使經過車輛上通訊單元(On Board Unit，OBU)即使在 CCH Interval 也
能使用切換到不同 SCH 進行傳輸，而不會漏失任何重要的安全及控制訊息。我們也在此架
構下，設計了有效的多通道媒介存取協定(Multi-channel MAC Protocol)，使CCH 及SCHs 的
頻寬能充分被利用，並確保傳輸的穩定性。值得一提的是，我們所提出的方法完全相容於
現有 IEEE 802.11p/1609.40 的標準和應用，並且易於實作與建構，因此具有相當程度的從
商業化潛力。 
此外，我們也針對與車用隨意網路密切相關的行動隨意網路(Mobile Ad Hoc Network, 
MANET)，提出了可適性能源控制(Adaptive power control)的方法，可進一步減少干擾，並
同時達到能源節省(power conservation)的以及穩定拓撲的目地。

後，才能在 CP 時切到不同的 SCH 進行非安全訊息的傳輸。如圖二，由於車輛在外圈的範
圍已完成了通道協調以及安全訊息收送，因此可在進入內圈的 Service range 切換到不同的
SCHs。這樣的方法可大副提升通道的使用率，並且保提安全訊息的接收。 
然而，由於四可看出，DCAP 為了防確保上述的功能，切分了大部分的涵蓋區城來進
行協調，只剩一小部分的 Service region，是可完全使用 SCHs 的，因此車輛使用完整頻寬
的能力，在此架構下僅能維持一小段的時間。為了改善這樣的問題，本計畫提出一個新的
集中式架構，此架將不需額外切割區域作控制用途，可大副提升完整頻寬的使用時間。 
 
2. 行動隨意網路-可適性功率控制 
 由於無線網路沒有實體的限制，因此當大量的結點同時傳輸時，經常會造成嚴重的干
擾問題。功率控制(power control)是透過調整節點的傳輸功率(transmission power)，來縮減
節點彼此的傳輸及干擾半徑，這同時也能達到節點省點的目地，以延長網路的運作時間。
現在的方法主要可分為節省節點能源(reduce energy consumption of nodes)以及節省路徑能
源(reduce energy consumption of routes)兩大類: 前者透過減少節點分支數量(node degree )和
傳輸半徑(transmission radius)，來降低各別節點的能源消耗，如文獻[14-18]皆是採用此種作
法。而後者則是透過保留總能源消耗較的路徑(energy-efficient routes)，來降低整體網路因繞
徑所產生的能消耗，如文獻[19-21] 皆屬於此種作法。整體而言，這兩種作法的重要性是難
分軒輊的，各別節點的存活時間可透過前者而延長，而整各網路的總能源消耗可透過後者
而降低。然而這個目標確是無法同時達成的，為了縮減各別點的半徑或分支數，可能會犧
牲某此可建構能源有效的路徑，而為了保留能源有效的路徑又可能會造成過多的分支數和
更大的半徑。現有的方法都只能各別解決，然而實際的情況確是兩者都需要的，因此本計
畫提出了一個可調式能源控制的方法(adaptive power control)，能源較少的點可動態地減少
自己的半徑和分支度，而能源較充沛的點則可動態的增加自己的連結度，以支援更能源有
效的傳輸。 
另一方面，節點的行動性(node mobility)也是影響成效的關鍵，經常性的移動會造成網
節點必需耗費更多的能源去重建網路的拓撲，因此在我們的方法中，將考慮不同節點的行
動性，以提升網路的穩定性。 
更重要的是，我們的方法是完全分散和區域性的(fully distributed and localized)，每個節
點只需要獲取一個跳躍的節點位置(1-hop position)就能運作，不需要在整個網路廣播，也不
需要繁雜的控制封包，因此具有相當高的實用性與可行性。

而每一個SCH 可再切分成數個時槽(time slot)(圖五所示)，一個時槽必需有足夠的時間

最快進入交易區的車輛將會被指定最先有空時槽的SCH。進入的時間可根據頻道要求中夾

交易或者駛離交易區，預約的SCH 會再度被釋放出來，以供後面的車輛使用。除此之外，
由於車輛進入到交易區後，會在CCH 區間切換到不同的SCH，因此RSU 必需負責收集這

preserved when r = 0. More importantly, each node
can asynchronously determine its links in this graph
using the positions of its 1-hop neighbors. In other
words, the construction is fully distributed and localized.
However, the r-neighborhood graph was primarily
designed for stationary nodes. When applied to mo-
bile environments, more attention should be paid to
nodes’ mobility. Besides, for theoretical interest, the
power consumption model was simplified in our pre-
vious works. The simplification may overlook some
facts in reality. For these reasons, our goal is to extend
the concept of the r-neighborhood graph to a more
realistic network. To achieve this purpose, we make
the following contributions in this paper:
1) Generalized power consumption model: In [4], [5], [6],
we assumed the power consumed at the receiver
is negligible. Besides, the path loss is specific to
free space environments, where no obstacle or
reflection exists. This paper generalizes the r-
neighborhood graph to a more realistic power
consumption model. Both the receiving cost and
the general path loss exponent are considered.
2) More flexible structure: Although the energy con-
sumption can be adjusted through the parameter
r, the desired value of r would be varied for
different nodes. For example, a node with less
energy would prefer a larger r to reduce its
own transmission radius or node degree, while a
smaller r would be preferred if the node has sur-
plus energy to perform relaying for other commu-
nication pairs. In other words, an identical r can-
not provide the most appropriate settings for all
nodes. Therefore, we extend the r-neighborhood
graph so that each node u has the flexibility to
configure its own ru.
3) Energy-efficient maintenance protocol: To maintain
the topology for mobile nodes, each node has to
periodically broadcast a beacon to announce its
new position. It may consume considerable en-
ergy if the broadcasting power is large. We design
an energy-efficient maintenance protocol, named
the ANGTC. The ANGTC can drastically shrink
the broadcasting power for each periodic beacon.
Moreover, we prove that any reconstruction can
be done in 4∆, where ∆ is the beacon interval.
4) Adaptive configuration rule: We propose an adap-
tive configuration rule inside the ANGTC proto-
col to configure the parameter ru for each node
u. The rule aims at achieving balanced energy
consumption between nodes and routes, and im-
proving the stability of the topology.
For a detailed introduction to the r-neighborhood
graph and its challenges in mobile environments,
readers can refer to Appendices A.1, A.2 and A.3 in
the supplementary.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
2 specifies the network model and measurements.
Fig. 1. (a) Reduce transmission radius and node
degree; (b) Preserve energy-efficient route.
Section 3 defines the graphic structures and analyzes
their properties. The protocol and configuration rule
are investigated in sections 4 and 5. Section 6 presents
a series of simulation results. Concluding remarks are
given in the last section. The proof of any property
shown in this paper can be found in Appendix F.
2 NETWORK MODEL AND MEASUREMENTS
Given a deployment region ℵ, a set V of n nodes is
distributed on ℵ. Each node u ∈ V can obtain its loca-
tion Loc(u) on ℵ using a lower-power GPS. Besides,
the power consumption follows the path loss model [2].
More specifically, let pmax(u) denote the maximum
transmission power of a node u. Node u can transmit
to another node v only if td(u, v)α ≤ pmax(u), where
d(u, v) is the euclidean distance between u and v, α is
an exponent depending on the environment [2], and t
is the pre-detection threshold (in mW) at the receiver
side, t > 0. The network can be represented as a di-
graph Gmax(V ), where a directed edge uv ∈ Gmax(V )
if and only if td(u, v)α ≤ pmax(u). In addition, node v
needs additional c power to receive from u. Therefore,
the least power required for a transmission from u to
v in this model is c+ td(u, v)α.
Generally speaking, the topology control is to deter-
mine a subgraph of Gmax(V ). Consider a controlled
topology G(V ). The transmission radius and degree of
a node u in G(V ) are defined, respectively, as
Tu(G(V )) = max
uv∈G(V )
d(u, v); (1)
Du(G(V )) = |{v ∈ V |uv ∈ G(V )}|. (2)
Let pi(u, v) = v0v1...vh−1vh denote a path connecting
two nodes u and v, where v0 = u and vh = v. The
total transmission power required to relay on pi(u, v) is
P (pi(u, v)) =
h∑
i=1
[c+ td(vi−1, vi)α]. (3)
In worse-case situations, the energy efficiency of
nodes is measured by the maximum node degree,
Dmax(G(V )), and the energy efficiency of routes being
preserved is measured by the power stretch factor [3],
ρ(G) = max
uv∈V
P (pi∗G(V )(u, v))
P (pi∗Gmax(V )(u, v))
,
where pi∗G(V )(u, v) is the path with the least total
transmission power between u and v in G(V ).

Fig. 2. General fr-enclosed graph of a node u, where
c = 0, α = 2, and ru, rv, rv′ , rv” are all set as 1.
Definition 5: Given a set V of n nodes on ℵ, a set fr :
{rv1 , rv2 , ..., rvn}, 0 ≤ rvi ≤ 1, the general fr-enclosed
graph of V , denoted as EG∗fr (V ), has an edge uv if and
only if uv ∈ Gmax(V ) and Loc(v) ∈ ER∗ruv (u), where
ruv = max {ru, rv}.
Fig. 2 shows the fr-enclosed region of a node u
(white area), which is enclosed by the four r-relaying
regions (dark areas) of u with surrounding nodes v,
v′, v” and w (the darker areas are overlapped by two
or more regions). We can see that a node has a link
from u if and only if it is located in the fr- enclosed
region of u. To see how ru changes the shapes of our
defined regions, readers can refer to Appendix B.3 for
further illustration.
Now we show that the two structures are equiva-
lent (See Appendix E.4 for the proof).
Property 4: Given a set V of n nodes on ℵ, for any
fr : {rv1 , rv2 , ..., rvn}, 0 ≤ rvi ≤ 1,
NG∗fr (V ) ≡ EG∗fr (V ).
4 ENERGY-EFFICIENT MAINTENANCE
Based on the equivalence in Property 4, in this section,
we design an energy-efficient maintenance protocol
for the general fr-enclosed graph.
4.1 The ANGTC Protocol
The main idea of this protocol is to utilize the informa-
tion partially received from nearby nodes to confine
the broadcasting radiuses of subsequent beacons.
In every time interval of ∆, each node broadcasts a
beacon at a certain radius to nearby nodes. Consider
a node u. Let Su denote the set of nodes detected by
u during the previous ∆ time. Similar to Definition 4,
we define ER∗r(u|Su) as the general r-enclosed region
of u based on nodes in Su, i.e.
ER∗r(u|Su) =
⋂
w∈Su
{ℵ ∩Rmax(u)−RR∗r(w, v)}. (4)
The set of nodes in Su being enclosed by node u in
EG∗fr (V ) is specified as
Nu =
{
v ∈ Su|Loc(v) ∈ ER∗ruv (u|Su)
}
. (5)
In addition, we denote λu as the least radius covering
ER∗ru(u|Su), i.e.
λu = max
{
d(u, x)|x ∈ ER∗ru(u|Su)
}
(6)
With the definition in (6), for any node v in Su, if u
is within the radius λv of v which covers ER∗r(v|Sv),
then v will be included in a nodes set Bu. This is,
Bu = max {v ∈ Su|d(u, v) < λv} (7)
The radius covering all nodes in Bu is specified by
χu = max {d(u, v)|v ∈ Bu} (8)
Then, in the next maintenance process, node u will
broadcast its current position Loc(u), λu, and ru using
the beacon to nearby nodes at the radius Mu, where
Mu = max {λu, χu} (9)
On the other hand, if node u can not receive the
beacon from a node v over a beacon interval ∆,
the information about v will be discarded. In other
words, for every maintenance process, the broadcast-
ing radius Mu of u is adjusted to cover both the area
in ER∗r(Su) and all nodes in Bu, depending on the
information received during the previous ∆ interval.
For every ∆ time, the value of ru will be reconfigured
and broadcasted to nearby nodes along with the pe-
riodic beacon message. The protocol, named Adaptive
Neighborhood Graph based Topology Control (ANGTC), is
now presented below.
ANGTC PROTOCOL
Nu = {}; Su = {}; Bu = {};
For every ∆ time
reconfigure ru;
Nu =
{
v ∈ Su|Loc(v) ∈ ER∗ruv (u|Su)
}
;
λu = max
{
d(u, x)|x ∈ ER∗ru(u|Su)
}
;
χu = max {d(u, v)|v ∈ Bu};
Mu = max {λu, χu};
Broadcast (Loc(u), λu, ru) at the radius Mu;
Upon receiving (Loc(v), λv , ru) from a node v,
Su = Su + {v};
If d(u, v) < λv , Bu = Bu + {v};
Upon not receiving from v over ∆ time,
Su = Su − {v}; Bu = Bu − {v}.
An example of the ANGTC protocol is elaborately
illustrated in Appendix D.1.
4.2 Correctness and Convergency
Now we discuss the correctness and convergency of
the ANGTC protocol. We show that after nodes’ place-
ment changes, the neighbors set Nu and maintenance
radiusMu of each node u can be correctly recalculated
and converged to a stable status in constant time.
We assume that the propagation delay and compu-
tation time are relatively small in comparison with ∆
and the starting points of every time interval among

Fig. 3. General fr-neighborhood graph: (a)Power stretch factor; (b)node degree; (c)transmission radius
if not specified. For each instance, we construct a
general r-neighborhood graph for each combination
of α = 2, 3, 4 and r = 0.0, 0.1, . . . , 1.0.
The average results are depicted in Fig. 3. We can
see that the power stretch factors are increased by
r, and average node degree and transmission radius
degrade as r increases, which is completely consistent
with what we observe in Property 1. In addition,
as the path loss exponent α becomes worse (larger),
all matrices improve significantly. For example, when
α = 4, the average power stretch factor is only within
two times the optimal, even if n is up to 200. In other
words, in contrast to the original version where α is
always fixed on 2, the general version is more suitable
for a highly interfered or obstructed area. Hence, our
generation is worthwhile.
Table 1 shows the ratios of the average maintenance
radius (power) to the maximum transmission radius
(power) among 50 and 200 nodes. The ANGTC* is
the version enhanced by the power shrinking mech-
anism in Section 4.3. For small size networks, the
ANGTC can significantly reduce the radius by 5%
to 10% in lower density and 20% to 40% in higher
density. And for large size networks, the radius can
be trimmed by over 20% to 60%. In other words, the
ANGTC performs well, particularly in a large scale
or high density network, since in the circumstances,
the enclosed region of each node could be confined
by more neighboring nodes with shorter distances.
The ANGTC* protocol can further shrink the radius
up to 10%. Besides, the radius can be decreased by
r in a range from 3% to 18%, which is coincident
with Property 6, where the maintenance radius can
be adjusted by r. Noticeably, since the required energy
is the αth power of the radius, when α is large, the
shrinkage in power can be more significant.
6.2 Simulations
For each test case, we simulated 50 networks, each
with 100 nodes uniformly placed on a 1,000 meters
square region. Each node has a maximum transmis-
sion radius of 500 meters and is initiated by 0.5 Jules.
The 802.11b MAC is used for link-layer contention. We

modify the DSDV routing protocol [9] such that pack-
ets are conveyed on the least-energy path. The con-
nections of CBR traffic are established for 20 distinct
source-destination pairs, and the packet size is 256
bytes. The mobility pattern is based on the Random-
way point model. We test three speed intervals of
[0, 5] m/s, [0, 15] m/s, and [0, 30] m/s, to imitate
low speed, middle speed, and high speed circumstances,
respectively. In addition, the pause time of each node
is randomly taken from [0, 5] s. Each run lasts 200s.
For comparison, we also implemented the following
protocols in the ns2: The SMECM [10] is considered
appropriate for conserving route energy. It preserves
the least-energy path (i.e. ρ = 1) for any node pair.
On the other hand, the XTC [11] is considered appro-
priate for conserving nodes’ energy. It confines node
degrees to within 6, with connectivity guaranteed.
The K-NEIGH [12] is considered resilient to node
mobility. It only requires nodes to identify their K-
closest neighbors instead of their precise positions. A
pruning stage is proposed in [12] to revoke redundant

radius and node degree of the ANGTC are not the
lowest, it still outperforms the others. This is because
the enhancement of routes can also reduce the energy
expenditure of nodes. In other words, the nodes’
energy synergically is conserved in these two ways.
Fig. 7 shows the ratio of the maintenance radius
(power) to the maximum transmission radius (power)
The results show that our protocol requires no more
than 50% of power to maintain the topology. With
this improvement, the power can be further reduced
by over 20%. Notice that the radius (power) steadily
decreases along with the depletion of node energy and
slightly increases when some nodes are exhausted.
7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have generalized the r-neighborhood
graph into a more realistic power consumption model
with independent parameter ru to each node u. For
mobile nodes, we have also proposed an energy-
efficient maintenance protocol to reduce the beacon
power. It has been proven that any reconstruction
and power change can coverage in 4 and 5 beacon
intervals. Lastly, an adaptive configuration rule is
given to configure the parameter for each node based
on the node’s mobility and energy levels. Experimen-
tal results show that our protocol has significantly
reduced the overall energy consumption and network
life time. For future research, a node may lose impor-
tant information to construct the graph if a collision
occurrs. It is thus worthwhile to design a collision
avoidance mechanism for the ANGTC protocol.

100 nodes (a) NG1(V ) ≡ RNG(V ); (b) NG0.5(V ); (c)
NG0(V ) ≡ GG(V ).
Definition A.2: [10] Given a set V of nodes on ℵ,
the r-neighborhood graph, denoted as NGr(V ), has
an edge uv if and only if uv ∈ Gmax(V ) and there is
no other node w ∈ V such that Loc(w) ∈ NRr(u, v).
About the power measurements in (1), (2) and (3),
the r-neighborhood graph has the following mono-
tonic properties with respect to the parameter r.
Property A.1: Given any set V of nodes, for any 0 ≤
r′ ≤ r ≤ 1,
(i) Du(NGr(V )) ≤ Du(NRr′(V )), ∀u ∈ V
(ii) Tu(NGr(V )) ≤ Tu(NRr′(V )), ∀u ∈ V
(iii) P (pi∗NGr(V )(s, t)) ≤ P (pi∗NGr′ (V )(s, t)), ∀s, t ∈ V
Properties A.1(i) and (ii) indicate that the energy
consumption of a node can be conserved by choos-
ing a larger r, because the degree and transmission
radius of each node becomes smaller when r gets
larger. On the other hand, as indicated in Property
A.1(iii), more energy-efficient routes are preserved
for any communication pair if choosing a smaller r.
These results are immediately the consequences of the
following relationship in (4) [10]. It indicates that a
denser (sparser) topology can always be found by
decreasing (increasing) the r:
NGr(V ) ⊆ NGr′(V ),∀r′ ≤ r. (A.1)
Other features proven in [10] are listed below.
Property A.2: [10] Given any set V of n nodes, for
any 0 ≤ r′ ≤ r ≤ 1,
(i) Dmax(NGr(V )) ≤ ⌈pi/ sin−1(r/2)⌉;
(ii) ρ(NGr(V )) ≤ 1 + rα(n− 2);
(iii) RNG(V ) ⊆ NGr(V ) ⊆ GG(V );
(iv) NGr(V ) is symmetric.
(v) NGr(V ) is connected.
Property A.2(i) and (ii) indicates that the results in
Property A.1 behave the same in the worst-case. We
can see that the upper bound of the maximum node
degree is strictly decreased by r and, conversely, the
power stretch factor is bounded from above by an
increasing function of r
The relationships among NGr(V ), RNG(V ) and
GG(V ) are illustrated in Property A.2(iii). As shown
in Fig. A.1, where the NGr(V ) of 100 nodes with
r = 0, 0.5 and 1 are drawn. We can see that NGr(V )
is an immediate structure between RNG and GG. In
particular, when r = 1 and 0, RNG(V ) ≡ NG1(V )
and GG(V ) ≡ NG0(V ) [10]. In other words, the
energy efficiency achieved respectively by RNG(V )
and GG(V ) (as shown in Table 1) can be balanced in
our structure if the parameter r is carefully adjusted.
A.3 Challenges
Although the r-neighborhood graph has the above
advantages, it still confronts the following challenges
in a realistic mobile ad hoc network.
1) To simplify the theoretic analyzes, the NGr (as
well as the GG and RNG) assume that the re-
ceiving cost is negligible, i.e. c = 0. This assump-
tion is however not true for many commercial
devices. Besides, the path loss exponent α varies
depending on environments, and is an important
factor in the power consumption model (recall
that P (uv) = c+td(u, v)α). For instance, it takes 2
for free space, 2.7 to 3.5 in urban areas, and 4 to 6
inside a building [12]. The required transmission
power then affects the energy efficacy of a topol-
ogy. However, as can be seen from Definition A.1,
the structure of NGr is irrelevant to α. In fact, as
shown later, the NGr is specific to the case where
α = 2, i.e. the free space environment. Overall,
the NGr is designed under a simplified power
consumption model where P (uv) = td(u, v)2. For
this reason, our first step is to generalize the r-
neighborhood graph to any c and α.
2) As shown in Property A.1, the energy effi-
ciency between nodes and routes can be adjusted
through the parameter r. However, the best set-
ting of r would be varied to different nodes.
For example, a node u with less energy would
prefer a larger r to reduce its own Tu(NGr(V ))
and du(NGr(V )), while a smaller r would be
preferred if it has surplus energy to reduce the
P (pi∗NGr(V )(s, t)) for any s, t ∈ V . Therefore, we
also extend the structure such that each node u
has the flexibility to configure its own ru.
3) To construct the NGr, each node u should broad-
cast its Loc(u) and acquire the information from
its 1-hop neighbors. In order to avoid broad-
casting at a large power, we have proposed an
energy-efficient protocol in [10]. In this proto-
col, each node u starts its broadcasting power
at a low level. Then, the power will be incre-
mentally raised, until it reaches the maximum
power pmax(u) or coveres sufficient 1-hop nodes
to identify the node’s neighbors in NGr(V ). The
energy can be saved if the process stops earlier
before the maximum power is used. Such an
incremental approach works well for stationary
nodes. However, it is not suitable in a mobile
environment, where nodes move frequently. For
one thing, the process requires several iterations.

in Fig. B.3(b), the two regions are disjointed for the

B.3 Scaling the parameter r
Here we show how the parameter r is related to our
defined regions. For any 0 ≤ r1 ≤ r2 ≤ 1, it can be
easily derived from Definitions 1 and 3 that
NR∗r1(u, v) ⊆ NR∗r2(u, v); (B.3)
RR∗r1(u,w) ⊆ RR∗r2(u,w), (B.4)
The relation in (3) also implies that for any u ∈ V ,
ER∗fr|ru=r1(u) ⊇ ER∗fr|ru=r2(u). (B.5)
Examples of identical r for two nodes u and v are
visualized in Fig. B.4. The light-gray and dark-gray
areas in Fig. B.4(a)-(c) are, respectively, the NR∗r(u, v)
and RR∗r(u, v). The white areas in Fig. B.4(d)-(f), en-
closed by five other nodes v1, . . . , v5, are the ER∗r(u).
APPENDIX C
SUPPLEMENTS TO THE ANGTC PROTOCOL
C.1 Examples
A series of four diagrams illustrating the operation of
the ANGTC protocol is presented in Fig. C.1. For ease
of illustration, the example considers the case where
α = 2 and c = 0, and sets ru = 1 for every u ∈ V .
At time t − 1 (Fig. C.1(a)), the radiuses λt−1u , λt−1v ,
and λt−1w cover the general r-enclosed regions of
nodes u, v, and w, which are formed respectively by
nodes in {s1, s2, s3}, {s4, s5, s6, w} and {s1, s4, s5, v}.
Then, v and s3 are moved during [t− 1, t]. At time t,
each node broadcasts its (new) position as routine.
However, at this moment, λtu, λtv , and λtw remain
the consequences of the stall information at time t−1.
Hence, the radiuses would be too small (or large) for
the later maintenance. As shown in Fig. C.1(b), both
u and v can not be aware of each other due to the
(a) r = 0.0 (b) r = 0.5 (c) r = 1.0
(d) r = 0.0 (e) r = 0.5 (f) r = 1.0

relaying region, and general r-enclosed region, where

insufficiency of λtu and λtv . Fortunately, the updated
positions of the nodes in {s1, s2, s3} and {s1, s3, s4}
are received respectively by u and v, which provide
helpful information to adjust the enclosed regions
such that d(u, v) < λt+1u and d(u, v) < λt+1v , see Fig.
C.1(c).
On the other hand, due to the movement of v, the
node w is now located in the general r-neighborhood
region of u and v. So, by Definition 2, uv /∈ NGfr (V ).
But the enclosed region of w confines λt+1w within a
short distance, which means that w will be ignored by
both u and v. Consequently, at time t+2, v ∈ N t+2u and
u ∈ N t+2v . In other words, although the radius defined
in (6) is sufficient to cover the necessary neighbors, it
is not enough to revoke unnecessary nodes.
The insufficient part counts on the radius defined
in (8). See Fig. C.1(c) and (d). Since d(u, v) < λt+1u ,
d(u, v) < λt+1v and Loc(w) ∈ NR∗ruv (u, v), by Defini-
tion 1, d(u,w) < λt+1u and d(v, w) < λt+1v . Thus, at
time t + 2, d(u,w) ≤ χt+2w and d(v, w) ≤ χt+2w . As a
result, w ∈ St+3u and w ∈ St+3v , and thus v /∈ N t+3u
and u /∈ N t+3u . Simply put, the radius χt+2w covers any
pair of u and v where Loc(w) ∈ NR∗ruv (u, v).
C.2 Further Power Shrinking Mechanism
Even if the protocol reduces the maintenance power,
there is potentially a waste. See for example in Fig.
C.1(c) and (d). The radius λt+1u covers not only w but
also s4 and s5. Thus, at time t+ 2, χt+2s4 and χ
t+2
s5 are
extended to cover u, while in fact s4 and s5 are not
in NR∗ruv (u, v). For this reason, we attempt to further
shrink the radius χu.
Consider two nodes u and v. Let ER∗rv (v|Bu) denote
the enclosed region of v based on nodes in Bu, i.e.
ER∗r(v|Bu) =
⋂
w∈Bu
{ℵ ∩Rmax(u)−RR∗r(v, w)}.
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS 6
then used to calculate the minimum transmission
power that covers all the neighbors. To cope with
different mobility scenarios, the protocol in [20] uses
a learning automation based predictor to adaptively
adjust the displacement of nodes. The protocol was
further improved in [21] to dealt with sudden changes
in node movements.
Although the above topology control protocols con-
cerns the node’s mobility, they were designed to
improve the energy efficiency of nodes, i.e. to reduce
the transmission power of the nodes. None of them
concerns the energy efficiency of the routes. There
are, however, some protocols aimed at preserving
the energy-efficient routes [22], [23], [24]. The MECM
(minimum-energy communication network) protocol
[24] preserves the least-energy paths for the general
power consumption model P (uv) = c + td(u, v)α. A
revised version, called the SMECM (Small MECM)
[23], can further remove any redundant link uv. When
c = 0, the topology constructed by SMECM is equiva-
lent to GG. However, these protocols were primarily
for stationary nodes.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no study
dealing with the energy efficiency of nodes and routes
at the same time for mobile nodes.
APPENDIX E
PROOFS
E.1 Proof of Property 1
Proof: Given a set V of n nodes on ℵ, and a set of
parameters fr : {rv1 , rv2 , ..., rvn}, let us consider two
nodes u and v and two values r1 and r2, where 0 ≤
r1 ≤ r2 ≤ 1. It can be easily derived from Definition 1
that NR∗r1(u, v) ⊆ NR∗r2(u, v). Besides, no matter what
the value of rv is, we have
max{r1, rv} < max{r2, rv}.
Thus, we get
NR∗max{r2,rv}(u, v) ⊆ NR∗max{r1,rv}(u, v).
This implies that
uv ∈ NG∗fr|ru=r2 only if uv ∈ NG∗fr|ru=r1 .
Therefore, we have
NG∗fr|ru=r2 ⊆ NG∗fr|ru=r1 . (E.1)
This relationship immediately implies the three mono-
tonic properties.
E.2 Proof of Property 2
Proof: In [10], we have proved that
Dmax(NGr(V )) ≤ ⌈pi/ sin−1(r/2)⌉
for the original r-neighborhood graph. Therefore, to
prove the statement in Property 2(i), it is sufficient to
show that NG∗r(V ) is a subgraph of NGr(V ) if c = 0.
Let us consider two nodes u and v. Assume that the
edge uv /∈ NGr(V ). By Definition A.2, there must be
a node w such that d(u,w) < d(u, v) and d(w, v) <
d(u, v). In addition, it has been shown in [10] that
d(u,w)α + d(w, v)α < d(u, v)α(1 + rα). (E.2)
On the other hand, for any point x ∈ NR∗r(u, v),
we can derive from the third condition in Definition
1 that
d(u, x)α + d(x, v)α < d(u, v)α(1 + rα)− (c/t)(1 + rα).
Therefore, if c = 0,
d(u, x)α + d(x, v)α < d(u, v)α(1 + rα). (E.3)
Combining (E.2), (E.3), and the facts that d(u,w) <
d(u, v) and d(w, v) < d(u, v), we get Loc(w) ∈
NR∗r(u, v) which implies that uv /∈ NG∗r(V ). In other
words, for any 0 ≤ r ≤ 1,
NG∗r(V ) ⊆ NGr(V ), if c = 0.
Next, we prove the statement in Property 2(ii).
Given a graph G(V ) ⊆ Gmax(V ), we have shown in
[10] (see Lemma 6 and Theorem5 in [10]) that
ρ(G(V )) ≤ 1 + rα(n− 2)
if for any uv ∈ Gmax(V ) − G(V ), there is a node w
such that
d(u,w)α + d(w, v)α < d(u, v)α(1 + rα).
Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that NG∗r(V ) satis-
fies the above condition.
Consider an edge uv ∈ Gmax(V ) which is not in
NG∗r(V ). By Definition 2, there must be a node w
satisfying
d(u,w)α + d(w, v)α < d(u, v)α(1 + rα)− (c/t)(1 + rα).
(E.4)
Moreover, since r ≥ 0 and t ≥ 0, we get
d(u,w)α + d(w, v)α < d(u, v)α(1 + rα), if c ≥ 0. (E.5)
Therefore, the upper bound in Property A.2(ii) is also
applied to the general r-neighborhood graph.
E.3 Proof of Property 3
Proof: For any two nodes u and v, because
NR∗ruv (u, v) ≡ NR∗rvu(v, u), the symmetry clearly fol-
lows.
Consider the connectivity of NG∗fr (V ). According
to (E.1), we know that
NG∗1,...,1(V ) ⊆ NG∗fr (V ).
Let NG∗fr (V |c, α) denote the NG∗fr (V ) under specific
c and α. We can infer from (E.5) that
NG∗1(V |c = 0, α ≥ 2) ⊆ NG∗1(V )

E.7 Proof of Property B.1
Proof: Consider two nodes u and v. Under α = 2,
assume that the edge uv /∈ NG∗r(V ) . According to
(24), there must be a node w satisfying
d(u,w)2 + d(w, v)2 < d(u, v)2(1 + r2).
Moreover, we can obtain from a simple derivation that
d(u,w)2 + d(v, w)2 = d(u, v)2/2 + 2d(w,m)2,
where m is the middle point between u and v. Com-
bining these two facts, we get
d(u, v)2/2 + 2d(w,m)2 < d(u, v)2(1 + r2),
which can be rewritten as
d(m,w) < (d(u, v)/2)(1 + 2r2)1/2.
Therefore, the node w ∈ NRr(u, v), and thus, uv /∈
NGr(V ) Together with the fact in (E.4), if c = 0, α = 2,
and ru = r for any u ∈ V , we have
NRr(u, v) ≡ NR∗r(u, v),
which concludes the statement.
E.8 Proof of Property C.1
Proof: Consider two nodes u and w. If w ∈ Sminu ,
using the same argument in Property 5, u ∈ Bw,
after time t + 2. On the other hand, it is clear
that ER∗r(u|Smaxu ) ⊆ ER∗r(u|Bw). Accordingly, if
ER∗r(u|Bw) = ER∗r(u|Bw+ {w}), then ER∗r(v|Sminv ) =
ER∗r(v|Smaxv − {u}), which implies that w is not a
member of Sminu . In other words, for any w ∈ Sminu , it
satisfies that u ∈ Bw and ER∗r(u|Bw) = ER∗r(u|Bw +
{w}). Thus we prove it.
