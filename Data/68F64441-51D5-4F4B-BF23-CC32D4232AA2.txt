Abstract
The heat transfer characteristics of a viscous fluid driven by an unsteady stretching
sheet with a general thermal condition are examined. The prescribed temperature and
heat flux are allowed to be varied in a power-law manner along the flow direction. A
similarity solution to a set of ordinary differential equations, which are transformed
from the governing unsteady boundary layer equations, is solved numerically. The
calculated results show that the temperature profile and surface temperature gradient
decrease with the increase of the distance parameter r as well as the time parameter
m in the prescribed surface temperature (PST) and the surface temperature for the
prescribed heat flux (PHF) decreases with both r and m . Asymptotic analysis gives
the uniqueness or non-uniqueness of velocity and temperature functions for different
values of parameters.
Keywords: similarity solution, unsteady stretching sheet, heat transfer, PST & PHF

distribution specifying on the stretching wall. More recently, Liu and Andersson
(2007) further investigated the heat transfer characteristics of the same problem with a
more general form of temperature variations than those of Andersson et al. (2000).
Since the bulk fluid above an unsteady stretching sheet may be possibly spaced to a
great extent rather than that for a finite liquid film, Elbashbeshy and Bazid (2004)
studied the heat transfer of an infinite fluid layer driven by the unsteady stretching
surface considered by Wang (1990) and a specified unsteady temperature distribution
closely similar to that considered by Andersson et al. (2003). Though Elbashbeshy
and Bazid (2004) pointed out that the numerical results were dependent on the choice
of Prandtl number,“infinity”point as well as the integrating step size, Sharidan et al.
(2006) warned that the flow reversal shown in Elbashbeshy and Bazid (2004) is
inadequate, probably owing to the numerical methods used. Sharidan et al. (2006)
presented numerical solutions for velocity components of an infinite fluid layer driven
by the unsteady stretching surface and the heat transfer subjected to two specific
heating conditions, i.e. the PST and PHF situations.
Motivated by the previous literature the present analysis aimed to find the thermal
features of the infinite fluid layer over a specific unsteady stretching sheet considered
by Elbashbeshy and Bazid (2004) and Sharidan et al. (2006). The thermal boundary
conditions at the stretching wall were allowed to be varied with the distance and the
time, rather than those fixed in Sharidan et al. (2006). The unsteady boundary layer
equations were reduced into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) using a
similarity transformation and solved numerically employing a finite difference
method. The characteristics of the present flow and heat transfer problems were
therefore dependent on four major parameters, such as the unsteadiness parameter,
Prandtl number, distance parameter and time parameters. Since the effects of Prandtl
number and unsteadiness parameter on the flow and thermal aspects have been
viscosity, k the thermal conductivity and  the thermal diffusivity. The velocity,
temperature and heat flux specified at the stretching surface are assumed as:

where c is the apparent stretching rate,  is the effective stretching rate, b and
d are proportional constants, r and m denote the power-law parameters related to
distance and time, respectively. 0T and 0q are the reference temperature and
reference heat flux, respectively. The subscript w represents the properties specified
at the stretching surface. The surface temperature and heat flux in Eq. (7) are much
general than those used in Elbashbeshy and Bazid (2004) and Sharidan et al. (2006)
since we consider the temperature and heat flux at the wall to be varied in a
power-law manner with both distance and time. It should be noted that our
formulation is valid only for small time /1t since a stretching surface is assumed
in the present study.

we first discuss some simplified cases investigated by previous workers.
4.1 Special case 0A
The steady-state case corresponds to the early work by Crane (1970) with the
analytical solution for velocity being given by  ef 1 . This special case is
therefore equivalent to the heat transfer problem investigated by Carragher and Crane
(1982), where the temperature difference between the sheet and the ambient is
proportional to a power function of distance from the slit through which the sheet
emerged. The temperature function, for PST case, is expressed as

4.2 Special case 0mr and 0A
Under this circumstance, the temperature distribution specified at the sheet for two
heating conditions reduce to /bTT   and // 0qyTk  , respectively, i.e.
constant surface temperature and constant heat flux These are identical to the results
of Vleggaar (1977) and Dutta et al. (1985), respectively.
4.3 Special case 1Pr mr
Examining Eqs. (9) and (10) subject to Eq. (11), we find that if the temperature
function )( is replaced by the velocity component )(f , the thermal equation
Prandtl number, the temperature profiles fall from unity to zero for 2.1,8.0 A and
2.0, whereas )( first increases to its maximum and then decreases to zero for
steady state case 0A . For PHF case with the same parameters, temperature profiles
)( decrease from their wall values to zero as the similarity variable  increases
for 2.1,8.0 A and 2.0, whereas )( shows a negative-valued distribution, which
is a physically unrealistic, for 0A . This unrealistic behavior of temperature profile
violates the second law of thermodynamics since heat can not transfer from a lower
temperature to higher temperature.
In the present study we focus on the effects of two power-law parameters r and
m on the thermal characteristics of the unsteady flow for both two heating conditions.
In Figs. 2 and 3 we plot the temperature profiles in PST and PHF cases, respectively,
for varying values of r with fixed values A=0.8, 2/3m and 1Pr . It can be
observed from Fig.2 that all temperature profiles initiate from unity at the sheet, with
negative temperature gradients, and decrease to zero at large values of  for all
values of r . In addition the temperature profile and temperature gradient at the wall
decrease as the distance parameter r increases, which means a much stronger heat
flow from the wall arisen for this power-law temperature distribution. This
phenomenon was also elucidated by Liu and Andersson (2007) for similar problem
corresponding to a finite liquid film. For PHF case shown in Fig. 3, the dimensionless
wall temperature )0( decreases with the increase in r and the temperature profile
diminishes as the distance parameter r increases. Therefore the thermal boundary
layers exhibit a decreasing function behavior for distance parameter r for both the
PST and PHF cases.
The temperature profiles for varying time parameter m with fixed values 8.0A ,
2r and 1Pr are displayed in Figs. 4 and 5. Like the effects of r on thermal
characteristics, the temperature profiles and thermal boundary layer thicknesses

大城邦加羅爾，近當晚午夜時分先經過會議舉行場所 BNM 研究所(BNM Institute of
Technology)，再到住宿的場所 Bangalore City Institute，十二月十三日由當地學者陪同拜
會 BNMIT 的主管 Raja Murthy，一方面瞭解該校的相關訊息也參觀了該校的設施。隔日
十二月十四日展開一連四日的研討會議程，期間本人於第一日即發表論文，獲得了熱烈
的迴響。研討會的內容包含了幾個流體力學的課題，有流體動力學、固體力學、圖論等
等主題，我也從中獲取了幾個研究課題，預計未來數年間可以進行相關的研究。
本次會議印度理論與應用力學界一年一度的盛會，來自印度國內外學者 300 餘人共發
表約 150 篇學術論文，這次的會議包含了邀請國外學者十餘人，由 DST, ISI, CSIR, NBHM
及 ICTP 所贊助，值得一提的是著名期刊主編、英國多孔隙界質知名學者 Reeds 也出席
這場盛。
九月一日白天 Majumder 教授特別開車請本人與香港吳朝安教授一遊加爾各答市，還
到有兒子在台灣就讀的台灣人開的餐館用餐；晚間搭機經由新加坡返抵國門，結束了八
天的學術豐富之旅。
二、與會心得
印度人的學術特色就是很會做研究，不管什麼樣的題目都有人做；年輕人更是如此，
一個看來平凡無奇的研究課題，竟也能用普通的實驗設備做出發表於著名期刊的論文，
實在令人敬佩。
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者省略)
研討會第四日(12/17)本人與另外四名學者進行當地名勝 Mysore 的參觀，Mysore 是當

technological processes, for example in the extrusion of a polymer sheet from a dye, in the drawing
of plastic films, cooling of metallic sheet, and so on. During the extrusion of these sheets, the melt
issues from a slit and is subsequently stretched to achieve desired thickness. The mechanical and
thermal properties of the final product crucially depend on the stretching rate of the surface and the
heat transfer rate between the fluid and the driving wall. Crane (1970) was believed the first to
examine the flow problem of a viscous flow over a stretching surface whose speed is proportional
to the distance from the slit and he gave an analytical closed-form solution. The corresponding flow
and heat transfer problems subjected to prescribed surface temperature (PST) or prescribed surface
heat flux (PHF), with or without suction or injection, and even for hydromagnetic fluids were
investigated by Gupta and Gupta (1977), Chakrabarti and Gupta (1979), Carragher and Crane
(1982), Dutta et al. (1985), Grubka and Bobba (1985), Chen and Char (1988) and Vajravelu and
Rollins (1992). Above studies considered only the steady flow and heat transfer characteristics.
Since not all extrusion processes are purely steady-state, the unsteady stretching problem
becomes a necessary issue required to be investigated in more details. The essential unsteadiness
may arise from the suddenly motion of the surface, a suddenly applied temperature change on the
sheet or a specific form of time-dependent change of the two factors. The motion of a finite fluid
film due to specific form of stretching velocity was examined analytically by Wang (1990) using a
similarity transformation. Later on Andersson et al. (2000) extended numerically to heat transfer
aspects of finite fluids subjected to a specifically devised time-dependent temperature distribution
specifying on the stretching wall. More recently, Liu and Andersson (2007) further investigated the
heat transfer characteristics of the same problem with a more general form of temperature variations
than those of Andersson et al. (2000). Since the bulk fluid above an unsteady stretching sheet may
be possibly spaced to a great extent rather than that for a finite liquid film, Elbashbeshy and Bazid
(2004) studied the heat transfer of an infinite fluid layer driven by the unsteady stretching surface
considered by Wang (1990) and a specified unsteady temperature distribution closely similar to that
considered by Andersson et al. (2003). Though Elbashbeshy and Bazid (2004) pointed out that the
numerical results were dependent on the choice of Prandtl number, “infinity”point as well as the

temperature and constant heat flux These are identical to the results of Vleggaar (1977) and Dutta et
al. (1985), respectively.
4.3 Special case 1Pr mr
Examining Eqs. (9) and (10) subject to Eq. (11), we find that if the temperature function )( is
replaced by the velocity component )(f , the thermal equation (10) becomes identical to the
hydrodynamic equation (9) when both the distance and time parameters are set to 1 together with
unity Prandtl number. This implies that the solution of thermodynamic part )( can be obtained
as the one of the hydrodynamic part )(f for this particular combination of parameters.

thermal characteristics of the unsteady flow for both two heating conditions. In Figs. 2 and 3 we
plot the temperature profiles in PST and PHF cases, respectively, for varying values of r with
fixed values A=0.8, 2/3m and 1Pr . It can be observed from Fig.2 that all temperature
profiles initiate from unity at the sheet, with negative temperature gradients, and decrease to zero at
large values of  for all values of r . In addition the temperature profile and temperature gradient
at the wall decrease as the distance parameter r increases, which means a much stronger heat flow
from the wall arisen for this power-law temperature distribution. This phenomenon was also
elucidated by Liu and Andersson (2007) for similar problem corresponding to a finite liquid film.
For PHF case shown in Fig. 3, the dimensionless wall temperature )0( decreases with the
increase in r and the temperature profile diminishes as the distance parameter r increases.
Therefore the thermal boundary layers exhibit a decreasing function behavior for distance parameter
r for both the PST and PHF cases.
The temperature profiles for varying time parameter m with fixed values 8.0A , 2r and
1Pr are displayed in Figs. 4 and 5. Like the effects of r on thermal characteristics, the
temperature profiles and thermal boundary layer thicknesses decrease with the increase of m for
both PST and PHF cases. The dimensionless sheet temperature also decreases with increasing m
for PHF case. Since the values of fand  are positive within the entire boundary layer, the
terms fr  and Am in Eq. (10) share the same sign, therefore, it is straightforward that the
individual contribution to temperature distributions due to r and m is rather similar.
7. Conclusions
This study presents similarity solutions, solving by numerical method, for the heat transfer of the
unsteady boundary layer flow over a stretching sheet with variable thermal conditions. The results
shows that the temperature profiles and wall temperature gradients reduce with the enhancement of
both the distance and time parameters for PST cases, while the temperature at the wall also decrease
with r and m for PHF case. The thermal boundary layer thickness is reduced for increasing
values of r and m . Asymptotic analysis shows that the solution of velocity component is unique
