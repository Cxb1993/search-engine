[4-5].  Interface trap has a major impact on 
device lifetime and plays an important role on 
the threshold voltage, inversion layer mobility 
and the low frequency noise of MOS devices.  
A good surface with reduced number of 
interface trap is of importance [6-7].  
Furthermore, interface trap of MOS devices is 
another major contributor to leakage current 
besides the characteristics of dielectric 
material itself.  In short, to achieve a good 
dielectric/Si interface for a surface channel in 
a MOS device, the defect density at silicon 
surface must be minimized.   
A high-temperature annealing of 
Czochralski (CZ) Si wafer in hydrogen 
ambient has been reported to reduce the 
as-grown crystal defects close to the surface 
of Si wafer [8].  The denuded zones (DZ) are 
formed by either conventional or rapid 
thermal annealing (RTA), owing to the 
dissolution of the grown-in oxide precipitate 
nuclei near the surface [9].  Despite relevant 
studies being performed, the details regarding 
to the effects of DZ (low defect region) on 
electrical properties of MOS devices with 
high-k gate dielectric remain unclear.  
Consequently, this study finds it worthwhile to 
examine the electrical characteristics, the 
current-conduction mechanisms and the 
reliability properties of MOS devices made up 
of HfOxNy dielectric with DZ formed at the Si 
surface.  A bipolar-pulse-induced current 
(BPIC) technique through MOS capacitors 
was used to examine the effect of DZ on the 
energy distribution of interface traps [10]. 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
A. The Fabrication of MOS Capacitors With 
and Without Denuded Zone  
In this work, TaN/HfOxNy and 
TaN/SiOxNy stack films were deposited on 
(100) oriented p-type CZ Si wafer for MOS 
capacitor fabrication.  Localized oxidation of 
silicon process was performed for device 
isolation.  To investigate the effects of the 
DZ near the dielectric/Si interface, the CZ Si 
wafer was treated by furnace annealing at 
1200 ℃ in 100% H2 gas for 60 min (denoted 
as the DZ-wafer).  The untreated CZ Si 
wafer was used as a reference (the Ref-wafer).  
Prior to HfOxNy deposition and SiOxNy 
thermal oxidation, all wafers were cleaned 
through a wet cleaning process 
(APM/HPM/DHF).  The process used an 
NH4OH:H2O2:H2O mixture (APM) in a ratio 
of 1 : 4 : 20 (volume) at 75 °C and a 
HCl:H2O2:H2O mixture (HPM) in a ratio of 1 : 
1 : 6 (volume) at 75 °C.  Diluted HF (DHF) 
with HF and H2O in a ratio of 1 : 100 (volume) 
was used.  Next, hafnium nitride (HfxNy, ~ 2 
nm) films were deposited onto the DZ-wafer 
(denoted as the DZ_H sample) and Ref-wafer 
(the Ref_H sample) using reactive dc 
magnetron sputtering of a 99.9% pure Hf 
target in an Ar/N2 = 24/36 sccm ambient with 
a power density of 4.7 W/cm2 and a pressure 
of 7.6 mTorr.  A post-deposition anneal 
(PDA) using RTA was then carried out at 850 
℃ in N2 gas for 60 s to form HfOxNy (~4.5 
nm).  Notably, some oxygen in the form of 
HfOxNy may already exist during the Hf 
sputter.  To avoid excessive oxidation that 
might cause the formation of thick interfacial 
layer between Si and high-k dielectric, PDA 
was only performed in a N2 ambient with a 
trace amount of residual oxygen in both 
chamber and native oxide of Si surface.  
Regarding to SiOxNy gate dielectric, the 
DZ-wafer and the Ref-wafer were oxided in 
N2O at 800 oC (the DZ_S and Ref_S sample, 
respectively).  The EOT of SiOxNy films 
were around 2.6 nm.  Subsequently, a 40 nm 
TaN film was deposited via sputtering to serve 
as the gate electrode, and was patterned by 
helicon wave plasma etching.  After 
body-contact lithography, all wafers were 
subjected to body implantation (BF2+, 50 KeV, 
3 x 1015 cm-2).  Then, all wafers were 
annealed by a thermal furnace (800 oC, 20 min) 
and RTA (1050 oC, 20 s) after PR removal.  
The 550 nm tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was 
deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor 
deposition for metal isolation.  After contact 
hole etching, metal layer Al film with 
thickness of 500 nm was sputtered and 
patterned by helicon wave plasma etching.  
To use the BPIC technique, the backsides of 
all samples were also deposited with a 500 nm 
thick Al film by thermal evaporation 
following the oxide stripping.  Finally, a 
sintering was conducted in a N2/H2 ambient at 
420 ℃ for 30 min.   
 
B. Materials Analysis and Electrical 
Measurements 
Infrared spectra of the various samples 
were measured using a Fourier-transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).  The 
experimental conditions for FTIR were 
resolution=1 cm-1, scan number=200, and 
source=Glowbar which can provide FTIR 
measurement of wave numbers ranging from 
200 to 10000 cm-1 and 
detector=mercury-cadmium-telluride.  A 
scanning electron microscope (SEM) was 
used to view the image of silicon surface with 
and without DZ.  The SEM picture was taken 
using secondary electron contrast.  The 
HP4156 instrument was used to measure the 
I-V characteristics of MOS capacitors at 
temperature ranging from 25 oC to 200 oC.  
High-frequency C–V measurements were 
carried out at 100 kHz using a Keithley CV 
instrument.  EOT was extracted from the 
simulation program considering quantum 
effects [11, 12].  A BPIC technique through

straight-line fitting of [ln(Jg)] in Fig. 5 (a) 
indicates that the conduction mechanism at 
low-electrical field (~0.089 to 1.067 MV/cm) 
and high-temperature (T>100 oC) in HfOxNy 
dielectric films is dominated by SE.  
Meanwhile, the straight-line fitting of [ln(Jg/E)] 
in the Fig. 5 (b) suggests the FP emission 
mechanism at high-electrical field (~1.556 to 
4.410 MV/cm) and high-temperature (T>100 
oC).

E=(Vg-Vfb)/tHfON. 
In order to examine the depth of the trap 
energy level for the FP emission, the gate 
current density of the HfOxNy dielectric at the 
electrical field of –2.27 MV/cm as a function 
of 1/T ranging from 0.00211 (T=200) to 
0.00251 K-1 (T=125 oC) was plotted, based on 
the results of Fig. 4 and 5, as depicted in the 
Fig. 6.  Data analysis indicates that the 
energy level (ΦB) of traps involved in FP 
conduction for DZ_H and Ref_H samples are 
around 0.50 and 0.52 eV, respectively.

of –2.27 MV/cm as a function of 1/T ranging from 0.00211 (T=200

trap energy level for the Frenkel-Pool emission. 
C. Effects of Defects at Si surface on 
Reliability Characteristics of MOS 
Capacitors with HfOxNy Gate Dielectric 
To investigate the defect-related 
reliability properties, the stress-induced 
leakage currents (SILC) for various samples 
were studied as shown in Fig. 7 (a).  The 
DZ_H samples have a low leakage current at 
low-electric field because of their low 
interface-trap concentration.  After stress, the 
larger SILC at low-electric field for the Ref_H 
samples, compared to the DZ_H samples, can 
be attributed to higher interface-trap 
generation caused by more interface defects.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7  (a) Stress-induced leakage current 
(SILC) of capacitor for DZ_H and Ref_H samples 
under constant-voltage condition. The stress electrical 
field (E) is –5.11 MV/cm, with tHfON =4.5 nm, Vfb=-0.5 
V, Vg=-2.8 V of DZ_H sample.  (b) SILC [(Jg-J0)/J0] as 
a function of injected charge for various samples.  For 
sensed electric field (E) of DZ_H sample, with tHfON 
=4.5 nm, Vfb=-0.5 V, Vg=-0.15 V, the E is ~0.78 
MV/cm. 
 
The high-frequency (100 kHz) C-V 
curves of MOS devices following various 
stress times were analyzed as illustrated in Fig. 
8 (a).  Compared to Ref_H samples, the less 
distorted C-V curve after stress for DZ_H 
sample can be due to its less charge trapping 
at IL/Si interface, which is achieved by a 
lower amount of defects at the IL/Si interface.  
Figure 8 (b) shows the charge trapping 
induced flatband voltage (Vfb) shift of 
capacitor as a function of gate injection (Qinj) 
under CVS.  The flat-band voltage shift 
(∆Vfb) increases with gate injection.  The 
DZ_H samples have smaller ∆Vfb values than 
the Ref_H ones.

MV/cm.  The flatband voltage (Vfb) without 
interface-trapped charge taken into account is 
approximately –0.50 V and –0.52 V for DZ_H and 
Ref_H samples, respectively.  (b) The charge trapping
