responding to the problem and the trend, EPA, local 
government and public authority plan to transform the 
incinerator into agri-waste based bioenergy facility, 
the county and city merger plan by Executive Yuan, 
aggressively provide a chance to re-plan the 
collection and disposal system of regional waste to 
increase the efficiency, also probably clean out more 
process capacity of incinerator to be used for other 
purpose. The research propose to select an optimal 
location of transformative facility of incinerator, 
considering the biomass supply potential, land use 
policy, environmental and social impact factors. 
Meanwhile, considering the cost of waste collection, 
incinerator design capacity and heat recovery limit, 
an optimal model will be conducted to re-plan the 
collection system of waste to establish an overall 
assessment strategy of regional waste management. 
Kaoshiung city was selected as the case study.

Figure 1 shows the emission standard formulation procedure developed by the research. There 
are five major steps in the proposed procedure: define the regulated region and objectives, 
review existed standards, assess the health risk and technical availability, and formulate the 
emission standard. With refer to “Health risk assessment technical standards (draft) in Taiwan” 4, 
the risk evaluation index includes carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks shown as below: 
 
1. Carcinogenic risk 
 
Risk = C × Unit Risk                                             (Eq. 1) 
 
Where C is the concentration of carcinogenic substances; unit Risk is the inhalation exposure 
risk to cause cancer of unit concentration. The recommended total carcinogenic risk is between 
10-4 and 10-6. 
 
2. Non-carcinogenic risk 
 
The ratio of average daily dose (ADD) and reference concentration (RfC) is called hazard 
quotient, HQ. And the hazard index, HI, sums up the respective HQ for each pollutant, the 
recommended value of HI is lower than 1. 
 
HI = ΣHQ                                                     (Eq. 2) 
 
where: 
HQ ൌ ADD
RfC
 
 
The research applied Industrial Source Complex Model (ISCST3) to simulate the distributions of 
pollution emitted from stationary sources in the area. After obtaining the impact matrix, the 
contribution to hazard risk of the sources could be estimated. Finally, the study regulates the 
emission standard of ethyl benzene by checking the highest hazard risk throughout the area.  
 
CASE STUDY 
 
As shown in Figure 2, the research chose petrochemical industrial district located in Kaohsiung 
City as case study area, including Ren-wu, Da-she and Nanzi industrial parks. The results of the 
research are briefly illustrated as follows: 
 
1. HAPs emission spatial database 
 
The database contains the data of factory location, emission information and other geographic, 
fundamental layer maps. The emission data were obtained from Taiwan Emission Data System 
ver 7.0 (TEDS 7.0), the official records and reports, and partly on-site sampling results.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Owing to the limits of nature resources, the energy supply in Taiwan is highly dependent on imports. 
In 2009, 99.37 percent energy is imported from abroad. In the times that global fossil energy is 
getting exhausted, the fact that energy supply uncertainty will be considerably severe if the ratio of 
indigenous energy couldn’t increase in here.. Besides, traditional fossil fuels produce significant 
CO2 emission.For complying with the world trends of sustainable development and CO2 reduction, 
the improvement of energy efficiency and development of locally low-carbon alternative energy 
have become the key issues for Taiwan.  
 
Using renewable energy will not only help us to reduce the dependence on imported energy, but 
also decrease the pollution resulted from the use of fossil fuel. In terms of the achievability of dual 
objective: disposal the waste and increase the energy production, bio-energy has received more 
attention recent years. One of bio-energy: biomass pyrolysis oil, therefore receiving much attention 
lately. Wood pyrolysis is one of the earliest energy conversion forms. It was used to produce 
charcoal as fuel for iron and steel industry. Modern pyrolysis technology can be widely applied in 
many kinds of biomass, includes the extraction of volatiles, liquids as well as solid carbon. The 
used pyrolysis technologies could range from slow heating to flash pyrolytic methods depending on 
the variations across energy carriers (gas, liquid or solid)1.Fast pyrolysis is a process that organic 
materials are rapidly heated to 450~600oC in the absence of air. By fast pyrolysis technology, 
vapours, permanent gases and charcoal are produced, while the vapours are condensed into 
pyrolysis oil, and the conversion ratio is about 60 wt.% in typically. Pyrolysis oil can be used to 
produce renewable/sustainable energy and chemicals2. The utilization of biomass waste to produce 
industrial oil has become the primary direction for promoting sustainable energy throughout the 
world. In terms of a numbers of advantages, including high rate of oil production, high tolerance for 
different raw materials, high cost-effective, whole crop usage as well as low system capacity 
demand, pyrolysis oil has great potential for development in the new types of energy. 
 
However, the exploitation and application of fast pyrolysis technology is still under development in 
Taiwan. There’s still a need to study deeply and hardly to use biomass pyrolysis oil as an alternative 
energy in the future, including the evaluation of energy efficiency, cost effectiveness, and 
environmental impact. Hence, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technology was employed in the 
research to state the input and output flow of production and utilization processes, and further 
realizing the advantage, barrier and possible environmental impact brought from the development 
of biomass pyrolysis oil. The objectives of this study therefore focus on establish an environmental 
evaluation framework by the perspective of LCA for biomass pyrolysis oil. The results would help 
us to realize the superiority and inferiority of the renewable energy in Taiwan.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
1. Energy and environmental benefit 
 
The inventory results of input/output representation for pyrolysis oil production in energy and 
environmental aspects are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. Since the raw material of 
pyrolysis oil comes from the waste woods and considered as the renewable carbon, the green house 
gases (GHG) emission is neglected.

** Heat value includes pyrolysis oil and biochar (by-product of pyrolysis oil) . 
 
In the aspect of energy benefit, the results indicate that the energy consumption in pyrolysis 
processes is 2,730.59 MJ/kL-oil, but the energy yielding from pyrolysis oil which including oil and 
by-product of char is 36,019.03 MJ/kL-oil. The output-input ratio of energy is about 13.19, 
indicating that the development of pyrolysis oil has high energy efficiency. However, excluding the 
contribution of char, the output-input ratio of energy will decrease to 7.3. In environmental 
performance portion, the total net carbon emission is 176.64 kg-CO2/kL-oil for unit energy 
consumption as shown in Table 2. In addition, the evaluation result also shows that the total net 
emission of greenhouse gas is about 0.0089 kg-CO2/MJ. That is much lower than the emission 
brought from fuel oil (0.086 kg-CO2/MJ) or soybean biomass oil (0.033 kg-CO2/MJ)11.

2. Environment impacts 
 
The study employed characteristic determination, normalized analysis, and weighted evaluation 
skills to assess the environment impacts including the global warming potential, acidification 
potential and eutrophication potential brought from pyrolysis oil production. In which, the weighted 
evaluation sums up the environmental impacts for each aspect. The result of weighted evaluation is 
displayed in Table 3. The total environmental impact indicator is 0.12465 Pt and it is much lower 
than the impact from fuel oil with value of 0.69381 Pt for providing the equivalent energy. The 
various environmental impact potential is illustrated on Figure 2.

INTRODUCTION 
 
With the rapid development of industry and economic, the threat to health and environment 
resulted from industrial districts has received more concern in Taiwan. Expects for common air 
pollutants, such as PM10, SOx, NOx, ozone and lead, the hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) which 
can cause adverse effects to human health or the environment has also be paid much attention  
recently1,2. Taiwan started to study and investigate HAPs in early 1980s. Taiwan EPA first 
selected 30 prior regulated HAPs in 1995 and further added five compounds in 1998. However, 
due to the emission source of HAPs is complicated and highly differentiated3, before conducting 
the emission source database of HAPs and the emission standard setting procedure, it has 
difficulty to determine the staged regulated targets and reduction strategies. To solve the problem 
mentioned above, a petrochemical industry district located in southern Taiwan was regarded as 
study area. A HAPs emission sources spatial database was established on Geographic 
information system (GIS) platform firstly. Next, staged regulated pollutants by referring 
international and domestic-related investigations were recommended. Finally, a procedure of 
setting emission standard for HAPs was formulated and further used it to set the emission 
standard for ethyl benzene. 
 
METHODOLOGY 
 
The objectives of the research are to establish the emission sources database and draw up the 
emission standard formulation procedure for HAPs. The database was built in GIS platform, and 
provided the functions of query, display, and analysis. The emission standard setting procedure 
was formulated based on both technological and health risk considerations. Technology-based 
control strategy regulates HAPs to ensure that the reduction level and pollution prevention cost is 
within reasonable range, whereas health risk-based strategy pays attention to human health.

inhalation hazard quotient was 0.001103, it exceeded some limits. In the third assumption, 19 
mg/m3, the hazard quotient was 0.00105, which was perfectly meeting the limit. Thus, the 
research adopted 19mg/m3  as the critical emission standard of ethyl benzene for the sources 
located within study area. 
 
According to the statistic recorded in TEDS, the emission concentration of ethyl benzene for 
petrochemical industry all fall in the interval between 3.3610-3 to 8.310-9 mg/m3 , which was 
much lower than the standard recommended above, hence, the research reasonably inferred that 
the emission standard is technical availability.  
 
SUMMARY 
 
There are some significant results and contributions could be concluded below: 
 
1. The research established an emission spatial database of HAPs for the petrochemical 
industrial district in Kaohsiung, and drew up a procedure for formulating the emission 
standard under health and technical availability considerations. It would be contributive to 
estimate long-term pollution tendency and program the pollution control strategies. 
 
2. 17 pollutants were proposed as the first-stage regulated compounds of petrochemical 
industry in this study area. Of which, the research recommended 1,3 butadiene and vinyl 
chloride to be added into the existed 30 prior regulated list of Taiwan.  
 
3. Ethyl benzene was selected as the target pollutant in the case study to demonstrate the 
feasibility of proposed emission standard formulation process for HAPs.

RESEARCH METHODS 
 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been defined by Society of Environmental Toxicology and 
Chemistry (SETAC) as an objective process to evaluate the environmental burdens associated 
with a product, process or activity. By identifying and quantifying the consumption of energy 
and materials, and the waste released to environment throughout the process or activity, LCA 
could evaluate and implement the opportunities for designer to improve the environmental 
performance3-5. The methodology of LCA can be divided into four interrelated phases, namely: 
(1) goal and scope definition, (2) life cycle inventory (LCI), (3) life cycle impact assessment 
(LCIA) and (4) life cycle interpretation6-8. It should be note that if there are any missing 
information occurred in any phase, it will affect continuously on following phases and result in 
the inaccurate analysis result. Hence, the affected phases should be revised and improved 
cautiously9.  
 
The objective of this study is to quantify the energy efficiency and environmental impact resulted 
from biomass pyrolysis system. The pyrolysis processes designed by Industrial Technology 
Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan was selected as the case study. Values of parameters adopted 
the simulation results by chemical process simulators Aspen plus©. one kiloliter of biomass 
pyrolysis oil and megajoule of energy unit were chosen as the functional unit during the life 
cycle assessment. 
 
To compare different biomass pyrolysis technologies completely, the system boundary of LCA 
should consider sufficiently taking all the elements of interest into account10. As shown in Fig.1, 
there are four primary processes considered incorporated within this study, namely: biomass 
collection, pyrolysis oil production, pyrolysis oil transportation, and pyrolysis oil utilization. 
In energy consumption analysis, biomass collection, pyrolysis oil products manufacture and 
transportation were considered; as for the analysis of environmental performance, three kinds of 
greenhouse gases (GHG) including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide 
(N2O) were taken into account. 
 
In this study, the direct and indirect air pollution emitted from processes and energy requirements 
per functional unit were evaluated. Furthermore, a series of specific and selected environmental 
impact patterns were assessed. The assumptions considered in this study are briefly listed as 
follows: 
1. The raw material is waste Cryptomeria. 
2. The environmental effect of pyroloysis oil products in utilization stage only considered the 
heating exhaust and greenhouse gases emission. 
3. The category indicator considered in impact assessment mainly focus on global warming, 
acidification and eutrification potential.

the contribution of char, the output-input ratio of energy will decrease to 7.3. In environmental 
performance portion, the total net carbon emission is 176.64 kg-CO2/kL-oil for unit energy 
consumption as shown in Table 2. In addition, the evaluation result also shows that the total net 
emission of greenhouse gas is about 0.0089 kg-CO2/MJ. That is much lower than the emission 
brought from fuel oil (0.086 kg-CO2/MJ) or soybean biomass oil (0.033 kg-CO2/MJ)11.

2. Environment impacts 
 
The study employed characteristic determination, normalized analysis, and weighted evaluation 
skills to assess the environment impacts including the global warming potential, acidification 
potential and eutrophication potential brought from pyrolysis oil production. In which, the 
weighted evaluation sums up the environmental impacts for each aspect. The result of weighted 
evaluation is displayed in Table 3. The total environmental impact indicator is 0.12465 Pt and it 
is much lower than the impact from fuel oil with value of 0.69381 Pt for providing the equivalent 
energy. The various environmental impact potential is illustrated on Figure 2.
