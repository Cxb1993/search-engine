Cross-term Forwarding Control of 
Homogeneous Charge Compression 
Ignition (HCCI) Engines 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In this document I provide some initial thoughts for potential research 
project related to the nonlinear cross-term forwarding control of 
Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines. This proposal 
is motivated primarily by my prior research experience on modeling and 
control of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines. The 
main goal of this project is to promote the development of a more clean and 
efficient power source for either stationary power generator or advanced 
vehicles. 
 
The basis of HCCI engines is their fast and flameless combustion after an 
autoignition process is initiated by the compression of a homogeneous 
mixture. The main advantages of HCCI engines include [1]: (i) their high fuel 
efficiency resulting from high compression ratio and rapid heat release and (ii) 
low NOx and low particulate matter (PM) emissions due to low cylinder peak 
temperature (below 1700 K). The technology, which is believed capable of 
providing as much as a 30% boost in the fuel economy of a gasoline engine, 
is a hot topic in automotive research labs at General Motors and Ford Motor 
Co. in the U.S., Volkswagen AG and DaimlerChrysler AG in Germany, and 
Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. and Honda in Japan. Vehicles powered by gasoline 
HCCI engines are a strong contender in the competition to create an 
affordable, high-mileage, clean-burning vehicle. HCCI could create a new 
class of powertrains that match the eye-popping fuel economy of a diesel 
without high emissions of nitrogen oxides, or NOx, and sooty particulates -- a 
problem that hampers the wider use of diesel engines. Even if in the near 
future all the new vehicles were hybrids (a combination of batteries and 
gasoline engines) that averaged double the fuel economy of today's vehicles, 
the best result would be that the world would hold its overall fuel use at 
today's levels. The reason being that there will be many more vehicles on the 
road then, which still reply on internal combustion engines. Hence a better 
way to measurably curb oil consumption is to significantly improve the fuel 
as manifold filling, as we have done in [5, 6, 12]. Lately, a cycle-to-cycle 
model has also been developed in [18] to control HCCI combustion by mixing 
hot and cold streams from the intake. Ohyama [20] developed a two-zone 
combustion model of an HCCI engine and simplified the model for control 
simulation, but did not provide specific details for the simplifications. 
Input-output models based on system identification are used for control of the 
combustion timing with dual-fuel in [21]. 
 
In this project, we develop a discrete cross-forwarding controller that (i) 
includes the θCA50 nonlinearity and (ii) uses a positive definite Lyapunov 
function with Tivc set point (proportional Tivc feedback). This discrete 
cross-forwarding controller is designed based on a simplified model with only 
one state. The designed controller is then applied to the full-order single 
cylinder HCCI engine model (8 states) in [5, 6, 12]. The full-order single 
cylinder HCCI engine model is briefly introduced in section 2. The derivation 
of a Lyapunov function based on cross-term construction is shown in section 
3, followed by the simulation results in section 4 and conclusions in section 5.

The model presented in [5, 6, 12] includes a physics-based 
parameterization of HCCI behavior. The cycle-to-cycle mean value model 
(MVM) dynamical behavior is associated with (i) states representing the mass 
composition and pressure (or temperature) in the intake and exhaust manifold 
and (ii) the delay between cylinder intake and exhaust processes. The cylinder 
cylinder. The other two delayed states correspond to the gas temperature 
entering the exhaust runner,  and burned gas fraction in the exhaust runner,

er. The fueling level is denoted by Wf. The rebreathing flow W2c is controlled by 
the breathing lift (RBL). A conventional exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve 
controls the EGR flow rate W21 and thus the burned gas fraction in the intake 
manifold. The EGR flow mixes with the fresh air and passes through a heat 
exchanger (HEX) that controls the inlet manifold temperature at 90oC as 
shown in Fig. 1. All the model equations can be found in the APPENDICES.

The control gains k, a, β , andε  are then chosen so that (i) absolute value of 
all eigenvalues are less than 1 for stability and (ii) real parts of all eigenvalues 
are positive to avoid ringing. The closed-loop pole locations for different gains 
k, a, β , andε  are shown in Fig. 4.

In the following closed-loop simulations, the gains are chosen as 
, , 10=k 1.0−=a 8.4=β , and 36.0=ε . The engine cycle time τ  is assumed 
0.12s for 1000 rpm. To emulate the cycle-to-cycle variation observed in the 
experiment data, a Gaussian distributed noise with standard deviation 1 
degree is added to 50CAθ  measurement. Fig. 5 shows the controlled 
performance with the cross-term forwarding controller during fuel steps 9-10-9 
mg/cycle at 1000 rpm. The cross-term forwarding controller stabilizes the 
temperature Tivc and regulates the combustion timing during fuel steps. The 
integral state q is bounded in relation to the temperature Tivc, resulting from the 
construction of the Lyapunov function V in (2.5). Fig. 6 shows the closed-loop 
responses with the feedback controller during fuel steps 9-13-9 mg/cycle at 
1000 rpm. The combustion timing 50CAθ  converges to the desired value within 
3 cycles when fuel steps up. On the other hand, late combustion timing is 
observed during the first cycle when fuel steps down, but the feedback

5. Conclusions 
 
A discrete cross-term forwarding controller for regulating combustion timing 
during load transitions is presented in this report. It is based on cross-term 
construction of Lyapunov function using a model which contains physics-based 
parameterization of HCCI behavior. The performance of the closed-loop 
system is evaluated via simulation of the full order model, which includes the 
manifold filling dynamics, exhaust runner heat transfer, combustion and 
cycle-to-cycle variation of the combustion timing 50CAθ . The discrete 
cross-term forwarding controller is able to regulate timing 50CAθ  by reducing 
temperature excursions during the load transitions between low load HCCI 
mode and high load HCCI mode. Simulations show that the designed 
controller is robust to uncertainties such as the manifold filling dynamics, 
exhaust runner heat transfer, and the cycle-to-cycle variation of the 
combustion timing 50CAθ . During a transition from a hotter region (higher 
fueling level) to a cooler region (lower fueling level), the control input needs to 
be filtered for a stable transition by taking into account the cycle-to-cycle 
temperature dynamics. This is achieved by the discrete cross-term forwarding 
controller designed in this project.
