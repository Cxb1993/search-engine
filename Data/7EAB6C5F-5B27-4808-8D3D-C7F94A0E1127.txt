英文摘要 
The properties and biological process of DNA are proposed in this project to solve 
the system identification problems. A systematic identification framework is 
developed via a DNA molecular computing algorithm. The computing algorithm 
serves as a device for the structure determination by incorporating the frequency 
characteristics of the identified system. The major advantage of the approach is due 
to its huge parallelism inherent in DNA-based evolution. The new design paradigm 
offers ways to implement simple but robust solutions that cover a wide range of the 
identification technique and provides satisfactory effectiveness of identification.

DNA classified as four bases: adenine (A), 
cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Both 
of these approaches have natural operators to help 
evolution of the genes generation by generation. 
Details descriptions about the operators are given 
below. 
Crossover is used to generate a new strand 
that will retain beneficial features from the parent 
generation. It exploits current gene potentials; 
nevertheless, if the population doesn’t contain 
enough encoded information to solve a particular 
problem, no amount of mixing strands can 
produce a satisfactory solution. For this reason, a 
mutation operator capable of spontaneously 
generating new strands emerges, which provides a 
mechanism to maintain the population diversity. 
There are two frameshift mutations that 
emphasize modification of the DNA structures: 
1. Enzyme Mutation  
The effect of enzyme mutation consists of 
separation and connection of a DNA string. In the 
former, the reacting molecules go through 
chemical changes rapidly. The newly formed 
molecules break away from the doped position 
and the reacted remainders of molecules are then 
joined together to form a new one. Hence, the 
indicated DNA string is able to be removed and 
the infected string also loss some information in 
next generation. 
2. Virus Mutation  
Virus mutation is another especially useful 
for changing strings status where the DNA strings 
have lager capability of broadening their length 
and variant status of stings are easy to obtain 
different mutation results. Hence, the inserted 
DNA string makes incursion into their parents’ 
string to form a new one through this mechanism. 
3. DNA-Coding Scheme 
The system’s structure and its parameters to 
identify a dynamic system are constructed by 
using the DNACA in which maps to the amino 
acids through the transfer RNA (tRNA). The 
biologists have discovered 20 amino acids 
encoded by 64 codons which are the versatile 
combinations of {A, C, T, G}.The network 
structure can be anyone of four different forms 
and each one appears with equal probability to 
map the amino acids. As in the biological DNA, a 
gene starts with the codon ATG and ends with the 
codon TAA, TAG or TGA. 
 In this section, the electro-ion interaction 
potential is applied instead of classical binary 
system. In this method, amino acid sequences 
should have its own transformation into a 
numerical sequence. Each amino acid is 
represented by the value of the electron-ion 
interaction potential (EIIP)5 which describes the 
average energy states of all valence electrons, 
especially amino acids. Then, normalization is 
then used for building an orthogonal based of 
these values shown in Fig. 1. This called as the 
normalized EIIP wheel of amino acids. Referring 
to the Fig. 1, all amino acid could be divided five 
groups based on their EIIP. The decoded 
parameters are calculated by

where r, M  and N  control the range and

is encoded as a vector of floating numbers, with 
the same length.

 One part of identified model6 has been 
selected. The authors of this reference proposed 
method can not lead a simplify model so that this 
result is more difficult for the experimental 
application. Moreover, it is almost impossible to 
estimate and compute good transfer function to 
approximate or simplify a system model by hand. 
Where the data are given for the frequency 
interval [ 210− , 310 ] and this interval section is also 
divided into four different sections [ 210− , 1 ], 
[ 210− ,10], [ 210− , 210 ], and [ 210− , 310 ]. For each section, 
the DNACA is used to optimize the structure and 
parameters of the estimated transfer function step 
by step. The parameters setting for the DNACA 
are chosen as follows 
 Population size: 70, Resolution: 15 codons, 
Max. generations: 100; Parameters range: [-10, 
10], Enzyme rate: 0.4, Virus rate: 0.4. 
 During 400 generations, the final results and 
transfer function are shown in Fig 4 and the result 
is as follows

 In Figs. (7b-7d), the result of the first interval 
section are used as initial model for further 
interval sections and the influence is obvious to 
tracking the phase shape with the proper transfer 
function. Figure 5 shows the change rates of the 
average tracking error and the maximum tracking 
error. This figure verifies that two estimating 
errors could be reduced continuously seeks the 
superior model through the DCA process in next 
frequency section. 
PART2: NONLINEAR SYSTEM 
1. Configurable Neural Network 
 To consider a multiple-input and multiple 
output (MIMO) -layerl  feedforward neural 
network, the number of hidden nodes for each 
hidden layer is chosen by increasing or decreasing 
until the approach performance in terms of fitness 
function is good enough. The relationship of input 
and output vectors of the proposed neural network 
is as follows:

 However, a fixed structure may not provide 
the optimal performance within a give training 
period. A simple network may not give good 
performance owing to its limited information 
processing power but the implement cost is much 
cheaper than larger structure. To make the 
network structure automatically tuning, DNACA 
method can be used.

IDENTIFICATION, AND CONTROL ~MIC 2006~) 係 IASTED 國際科學與科技發展組織學會
(The International Association of Science and Technology for Development)一年一度所舉辦的國
際性學術研討會，該研討會以廣邀全球從事相關電機工程研究的學者及專家發表論文、交換
研究心得及介紹前瞻控制工程發展及系統識別為主要目的，與本人同行參加這個會議者尚有
一位博士生與兩位碩士班研究生。該研討會每年在歐洲各地輪流舉辦，今年之學術研討會於
西班牙加那利群島(Canary Islands)中Lanzarote市舉行。會議地點位於當地海灘(Las Cucharas)
旁的Gran Meliá Salinas hotel飯店。此會議場所是島上唯一五星級的旅館，其議程於內部會議
中心等房間中舉行。本次此次投稿之論文近三百餘篇，發表之論文篇數亦高達約一百餘篇，
如同一般研討會本次會議進行時為為多軌同時舉行，主要涵蓋有十一多種類電機控制相關領

鐘，沿路盡是沙灘及碧海藍天，讓長期待在生活緊湊繁瑣的我們，瞬間放鬆心情並融入當地
悠閒緩慢的步調。由於小島位處北非附近，一年四季天氣溫暖氣候適中，為西班牙著名度假
勝地，因此常可遇見各國觀光客，是一個相當熱鬧活躍的小島。由於提早一天到達，因此一
