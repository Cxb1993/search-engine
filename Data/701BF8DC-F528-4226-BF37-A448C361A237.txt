Abstract 
The GWMA control chart, with 
time-varying control limits to detect start-up 
shifts more sensitively, performs better in 
detecting small shifts of the process mean. The 
GWMA control chart is designed under 
assumption that the observations come from a 
normal distribution. The robustness of the 
GWMA control chart to non-normality is 
considered by assuming that the mean and 
standard deviation are known, but that 
observations actually follow not a normal 
distribution.The ARL of the GWMA control 
chart is affected when the assumption of 
normality is violated. However, adjusting 
parameter of GWMA control chart can 
compensate for the problem of in-control ARL 
deterioration. The GWMA control chart also 
performs well in detecting shifts in the process 
mean when normality is violated. Because 
GWMA control chart has a high capability for 
detecting small shifts in a process, this study 
develops a robust design GWMA control chart 
by employing the VBA program to monitor the 
process quality.

2.2 ROBUSTNESS OF THE GWMA 
CONTROL CHART TO 
NON-NORMALITY  
The robustness of the GWMA control chart 
to non-normality is addressed by assuming that 
the mean and standard deviation are known, but 
that observations follow the gamma distribution, 
rather than a normal distribution. The gamma 
distribution can be represented as GAM (r,β). 
For the cases explored herein, r =0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, while β=1. For comparison, the GWMA 
control chart was set with various values for 
design parameters: q=0.95, 0.90, 0.80; L=3.00, 
and α =1.00, 0.90, 0.80. Table 1 to 3 reveal that 
the ARLs for the GWMA control chart follow 
the gamma distributions for the r=0.5, 1, 4. The 
figures in parentheses present the standard 
deviation of ARL. The GWMA control chart 
retains its advantage in detecting small shifts, 
but decreases the in-control ARL. When the 
observations come from the gamma distribution, 
the in-control ARL of the GWMA control chart 
moderately deteriorates, particularly) when the 
value of adjustment parameter α declines (see 
Fig. 1). However, the in-control ARL of the 
GWMA control chart clearly deteriorates, 
particularly as the value of design parameter q 
declines (see Fig. 2).

ABSTRACT  
The GWMA control chart, which has time-varying control limits to detect start-up shifts more 
sensitively, effectively detects small shifts in process mean. The GWMA control chart is designed 
under assumption observed results are normally distributed. This study addresses the robustness of 
the GWMA control chart to non-normality by assuming that the mean and standard deviation are 
known, but that observations do not follow a normal distribution. 
The average run length (ARL) of the GWMA control chart is affected when the assumption of 
normality is violated. However, adjusting parameter of GWMA control chart can compensate for 
the problem of in-control ARL deterioration. The GWMA control chart also performs well in 
detecting shifts in the process mean when normality is violated.

ROBUSTNESS OF THE GWMA CONTROL CHART TO NON-NORMALITY  
The robustness of the GWMA control chart to non-normality is addressed by assuming that the 
mean and standard deviation are known, but that observations follow the gamma distribution, rather 
than a normal distribution. The gamma distribution can be represented as GAM (r,β). For the cases 
explored herein, r =0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, while β=1. 
For comparison, the GWMA control chart was set with various values for design parameters: 
q=0.95, 0.90, 0.80; L=3.00, and α =1.00, 0.90, 0.80. Table 1 to 3 reveal that the ARLs for the 
GWMA control chart follow the gamma distributions for the r=0.5, 1, 4. The figures in parentheses 
present the standard deviation of ARL. The GWMA control chart retains its advantage in detecting 
small shifts, but decreases the in-control ARL.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
The ARL of the GWMA control chart is affected when the assumption of normality is violated. 
The in-control ARL deteriorates; i.e., the number of false alarms caused by the GWMA control 
chart exceeds that of the EWMA control chart. However, raising the control limit width, L, can 
compensate for the problem of in-control ARL deterioration. The GWMA control chart also 
performs well in detecting shifts in the process mean when normality is violated.

ABSTRACT 
Quality has always been of priority concern in supply management. Selecting the most 
appropriate control chart is important. This study presents a Poisson generally weighted moving 
average control chart (Poisson GWMA control chart) for monitoring Poisson counts. The Poisson 
GWMA control chart is superior to the c chart as measured by average run length (ARL). Managers 
use information technology throughout the entire supply chain through to customer relationships. 
This study uses the Visual Basic for Application (VBA) program language to design computer-aided 
software for the Poisson GWMA control chart to provide enterprises be promoting the reference for 
supply chain quality system.

 INTRODUCTION 
In today fast-paced global economy, time-to-market constraints demand that business produce 
products with increased speed, and quickly delivery high-quality products to customers. Total 
quality management (TQM) is a philosophy and management system that focuses on customer 
satisfaction. In TQM, a customer can be internal or external, and is anyone in the supply chain who 
receives materials from a previous stage in the chain. Quality, quantity, delivery, price, and service 
are the five most common supply requirements. Quality has always been a primary concern in 
supply management. In the total quality management context, the definition of was expanded to 
represent a combination of corporate philosophy and quality tools directed toward satisfying 
customer needs (Leeders et al., 2006). Monczka et al. (2005) proposed that supplier quality is the 
ability to meet or exceed current and future customer expectations or requirements within critical 
performance areas on a continual basis. Managing quality in supply chain activities focuses on how 
efficiency and profitability can be enhanced in relationships between buyers and sellers by 
continuous quality improvement. Monitoring quality carefully throughout the duration of 
contractual relationships is important as quality is continuously adjusted through interactions; in

value of a mean number of defects per inspection unit. The 0Y  represents the starting value set by a 
practitioner. Setting 00 cY =  is convenient. For the Poisson GWMA control chart, the sample 
statistic is a weighted average of the current observation jC  and all previous observations, with 
the current observation most heavily weighted. Consequently, jY  can be configured as

Step 2. The magnitude of the shift in the process must be determined quickly, 
that is, the magnitude with a small ARL1, and then select the q, α and L 
that produces a minimum ARL1 for the size shift, and then satisfy the 
ARL0 constraint from Step 1. 
Step 3. Use the values of q, α and L obtained in Step 2 to determine the control 
limits and plot the Poisson GWMA control chart. 
 
 
POISSON GWMA CONTROL CHART SOFTWARE 
Microsoft VBA is easy to use. Any Visual Basic–like language can be used as a scripting 
language to program and automate numerous applications (Albright, 2001). Developers using 
applications programmed with VBA can automate and extend the functionality of those applications, 
reducing the development cycle for custom business solutions. This study uses the VBA to design 
computer-aided software for the Poisson GWMA control chart and provide an enterprise with a 
reference for the supply chain quality system. 
Users can select the sample size when running the Poisson GWMA chart (Fig. 1), and the 
system has the following five buttons (Fig. 2):   
1. Clear data. 
2. Calculate Poisson GWMA statistics.  
3. Calculate the control limit. 
4. Display Out-of-control signals. 
5. Return to the main screen.

Data is cleared when the clear button is pushed. Calculate the Poisson-GWMA Yj button for 
the Poisson GWMA control chart being plotted. Input q, α, L, and target mean 0c , the system then 
calculates the Poisson-GWMA statistics. When the calculate control limits button is selected, the 
system displays the control limits. Finally, when the display out-of-signals button is selected, the 
system displays the Poisson-GWMA Yj in a red boldface font. The system directly presents the 
Poisson-GWMA control chart in real time.

 Values q=0.9, α=0.8, L=2.731, and target mean=30 are then input and the system calculates 
the Poisson GWMA statistics (Figs. 3 and 4). Completing all steps results in display of the Poisson 
GWMA chart and out-of-control; the out-of-control is displayed in red.

Conclusion 
Numerous companies utilized software and hardware to assess driftage. Information technology 
is typically used throughout the whole supply chain through to customer relationships. This study 
utilizes Visual Basic for system applications to monitor the process. Selecting the most appropriate 
control chart is important. The traditional Shewhart chart is suitable for detecting large shifts in the 
process mean. However, the proposed Poisson GWMA control chart for monitoring Poisson counts 
is superior to Shewhart c charts in terms of ARL considerations. The Poisson GWMA control 
scheme, with time-varying control limits that increase the sensitivity at start-up shifts, performs 
better when detecting small shifts in the process mean.
