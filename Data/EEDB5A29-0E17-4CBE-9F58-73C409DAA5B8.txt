Abstract 
This project presents an approach to assessing transient 
stability of an interconnected power system which 
comprises of synchronous generator (SG) and induction 
generator (IG). Stability performance indices are 
developed for both SG and IG. The power systems under 
investigated were modelled, developed and simulated 
using SimPowerSystems®. Fundamental analysis was 
carried out in an attempt to discover the transient stability 
characters of the given power systems. Multilayer 
perceptrons (MLP), and classification and regression tree 
(CART) were employed to assess stability status and 
stability performance index for both SG and IG. 
Comprehensive digital simulations shall justify the 
proposed approach.

二. 緣由與目的 
Renewable energy system has attracted much 
overwhelming attention in recent years. There are several 
major reasons for this urgent requirement: limited 
amounts of fossil fuel resources, environment pollution 
and global warming. In Taiwan, at the end of 2005, there 
was 1927 MW renewable energy capacity had been 
deployed, which was 5.3% of total installed capacity. 
Taiwan government has declared that the capacity of 
renewable energy will increase to 5130 MW before 2010 
[1]. Among the various renewable energy, wind power is 
the best choice because of its high efficiency in energy 
transform and low cost in apparatus [2]. It has been found 
that the wind power resource containing within Taiwan 
area would be second to the United Kingdom [3].  
 
Wind-driven generation systems usually employ 
induction generators. They appear to be the right choice 
for wind turbine renewable energy systems because they 
are robust and economical. The advantages of using 
induction generator in stead of synchronous generators 
include reduced unit cost and size, ruggedness and robust, 
lack of extra excited dc source, ease of maintenance, 
natural protection against severe overloads and short 
circuit. The appearance of induction generators will 
impact existing power system which is conventionally 
dominant by synchronous generators. The impact would 
reflect in many fields including power factor correction, 
voltage fluctuation, flicker, protection coordination, short 
circuit current calculation, harmonic and power system 
stability [4].  
 
For the power system stability respect, IG performs rather 
different manner from SG [5-14]. For example, in 
damping stability field, the former does not have rotor 
back-swinging phenomenon while the latter does. In the 
voltage stability field, IG lack of reactive power 
compensating ability, unlike SG that can compensate by 
using the rotor excitation systems. This inability causes 
IG vulnerable to voltage stability.  
 
Since primary renewable energy source fluctuating from 
time to time, it is quite difficult to predict the amount of 
renewable energy generation. Such a generation 
fluctuation will cause frequent changes of power system 
operating condition, and in turn lead to the need for 
transient stability assessment. In this paper, we use MLP 
and CART to assess the transient stability. In addition, 
most research focuses on individually discussion of IG 
and SG performance in power system dynamics. They 
compared their difference, rather than discussed the 
interaction influence between them. This paper also 
discusses the interaction between SG and IG in a given 
power system.

We can conclude that for the stable case, lower PI value 
indicates more stable degree of the power system. With 
respect to the unstable case, on the contrary, lower PI 
value implies more unstable degree of the power system. 
This principle applies to both SG and IG.  
 
D. Data Generation  
In this study, we took into account 300 different operating 
conditions by randomly changing the variables within 10 
percent of their nominal values. For each operating 
condition we applied a three-phase ground fault at 
different locations including fault at bus 2 (IG), at bus 3 
(load centre) and at bus 4 (SG), and recorded the stability 
status of SG and IG, and the PI values of SG and IG. 
Thus, we had totally 900 cases.  
 
E. Fundamental Analysis 
In this section we perform fundamental analysis by 
plotting stability status as well as performance index (PI) 
with respect to various power system parameters, 
according to just generated 900-case data. 
 
E1. Stability Status 
Fig. 2 shows the stability status of IG at bus 2 with 
respect to its delivered active power, Pw. This figure 
appears that a threshold of 1.6 MW exists for splitting IG 
stable and unstable status, when a 3-phase fault occurred 
at bus 2.  
 
 
Fig. 2.  IG Stability Status (1: stable, 0: unstable) vs. Pw  
 
Fig. 3 shows the SG stability status with respect to P3, 
which indicates the stable and unstable cases are mixed 
together. No apparent threshold exists in the figure. 
Hence we are not capable of discovering any interesting 
relationship from this figure, unfortunately. This is not 
unexpected because this is an interconnected power 
system rather than a single-machine-infinite-bus one.

E2. Stability Performance Index 
In this task, we observe the SG and IG stability PI values 
with respect to various power system parameters. Some 
plots are displayed and explained below.  
 
Fig. 4 is for the mechanical power delivered to SG at bus 
4, Pm, vs. the SG stable PI value, when we considered a 3-
phase fault at bus 3. This figure demonstrates that lower 
Pm would have lower SG stability PI value, which would 
indicate the enhancement of SG stability. A series of 
time-domain digital simulations of gradually reducing Pm 
but kept remaining parameter unchanged were carried out 
in order to justify our observation in Fig. 4. The results 
were listed in Table II, where the decreasing Pm indeed 
lowered the SG stable PI. 
 
 
Fig. 4.  SG stabe Performance Index vs. system parameters

Fig. 7.  Stability Performance Index SG vs. IG - Fault at Bus 4 
 
Likewise, if we gradually reduce the active power 
demand at bus 3 P3 from 1.2 MW to 1.0 MW, when a 3-
phase fault occurred at bus 4, the SG and IG stability 
performance indices were computed and listed in Table V. 
Again, adverse interaction between SG and IG appears. 
When we reduce P3 to 0.9 MW and apply the same 
contingency, SG shall lose stability first. IG can stand the 
impact caused by the fault, but lose stability after 2 
seconds, due to the swinging power systems.

1.0 Stable 1.88 Stable 0.76 
0.9 Unstable - Stable 0.74 
 
F. Transient Stability Assessment by MLP and CART 
Transient stability assessment using artificial intelligence 
techniques has been a sound approach. The fast 
computation speed of this approach is a strong lure. In 
this section, we use MLP and CART to assess SG and IG 
stability status, and performance index.  
 
F1. Status Assessment using MLP 
In this task, we employed MLP to assess the SG and IG 
stability status. This is a classification problem because 
the stability status is either stable or unstable. The 
structure of MLP here is 15×10×1, indicating 15 input 
neurons, 10 hidden layer neurons and 1 output neuron. 
Table VI shows the results of SG stability status 
assessment.  
 
TABLE VI

 Training Testing 
Fault at Bus 2 96.0 % 84.0 % 
Fault at Bus 3 94.9 % 90.7 % 
Fault at Bus 4 91.4 % 90.7 % 
 
Table VII shows the IG stability status assessment by 
MLP. Nearly 100% accuracy is achieved.

 Training Testing 
Fault at Bus 2 95.6 % 96.0 % 
Fault at Bus 3 100 % 100 % 
Fault at Bus 4 100 % 100 % 
 
F2. Status Assessment using CT 
We can use CT to not only forecast the stability status, 
but also explore which input attributes will significantly 
affect the tree’s splitting process. Table VIII gives the 
results for SG stability status assessment after 20 CT 
splitting.  
 
TABLE VIII 
SG STABILITY STATUS ASSESSMENT BY CT 
 Training Testing Splitting Attributes
Fault at Bus 2 91.56% 93.33% Pm, V3, P3, Vf 
Fault at Bus 3 94.67%  88% Pm, Q4, P3, Q3 
Fault at Bus 4 98.67% 76% Pm, P3, V4, C3 
 
In Table VIII, the attribute Pm appears at first in each fault 
location. This indicates that this attribute, plays an 
important role in assessing SG stability status.  
 
Table IX shows the IG stability status assessment result. 
Notice that IG instability would appear only when the 3-
phase fault occurred at bus 2. Active power delivered 
from the IG, Pw, is at the first place of splitting attributes 
which indicates this factor significantly affects IG 
stability status in this power system.  
TABLE IX 
IG STABILITY STATUS ASSESSMENT BY CT  
 Training Testing Splitting Attributes
Fault at Bus 2 100% 88% Pw, P2, Q3, Pw, Q2 
Fault at Bus 3 - - - 
Fault at Bus 4 - - - 
 
F3. Performance Index Assessment using MLP 
In this task, we carried out stability performance index 
assessment using MLP. The structure of MLP was 
15×10×1. We employed all cases as MLP’s training data, 
and half training data as testing data. Table X and Table 
XI show the SG and IG stability PI assessment by MLP, 
respectively. The results are represented in RMSE, root 
mean squared error. The results are not satisfactory, 
although we have attempted for many trials.

第二天 (5/17) 週六 
太累的關係，昨天沒有睡好，因為住房的插曲，實在很想再回去找原飯店試試。所以今天一大早7:00我就回到原本
訂好的飯店詢問有沒有房間，請櫃檯能幫我留意一下。 
 
第二天早上是四場演講。中午詢問櫃檯有否空餘房間，櫃檯說只有兩人房，只是價錢也是要算兩人房的價格。很幸
運地有了空房，住房搞定，我也鬆了口氣，總算可以好好地休息。用過午餐後，進行下午的場次，分成口頭報告，
以及海報張貼。我是挑選和研究領相關的論文前往聆聽。很多海報張貼的論文，作者只是把文章貼上後，人就都不
在了。甚至還我們國內所謂的五年五佰億的知名國立大學的作者，把海報貼上後，就不見作者本身的身影，想要提
問題，也是不知要向誰問。讓人覺得這些五年五佰億經費是花在什麼地方？其實，海報張貼(Poster)場次裡也有很
多不錯的文章。 
 
Coffee & Tea Break時，沒想到有位大陸的研究生跑來問我昨天我論文簡報的問題。這真是沒想到，因為己經隔了一
天。他自稱是上海復旦大學的研究生，他提的問題，是關於心電圖訊號，這點就和訊號處理較為相關。他問我心電
圖訊號本身的特徵，像是低頻、高頻雜訊、直流漂移偏壓，以及與肌電圖訊號之間干擾如何消除等等。這些問題真
的很細節，看得出來他昨天是做足了功課。 
 
第三天 (5/18) 週日 
這天早上起床時，覺得整個人不太舒服，也許是太累了。到會場聽了兩個演講後，10:00就回房間打包行李。Check

整體而言 
這次出差，感覺到中國大陸的崛起。整體而言，上海在硬體方面確實是相當先進，道路橋樑與高樓大廈等設施，都

第一天 (5/16) 週五 
週五清晨5:00由家裡出發，搭乘華信航空，經香港轉東方航空公司前住上海班機。從小港機場抵達香港都一路順
暢，結果要前往上海的班機延遲1個小時才起飛，降落上海浦東機場時己是14:00。因為我報告的時間是這一天的最
後一場，場次是14:00 ~ 18:00，從浦東機場到目的地至少要兩個小時，很怕錯過口頭報告的時段。抵達上海後聽取機
場人員的建議搭乘接駁車到上海市，結果又發生上海市堵車壅塞，真是屋漏偏逢連夜雨。到達研討會場地時(粵海酒
店)己是當天下午將近17:00了。因為我口頭報告場次是14:00 ~ 18:00時段的最後一個人次，於是我決定先不去Check 
In安置行李，直接把行李直接帶到會場，也沒有時間換穿正式一點的服裝，因為口頭簡報還是最重要。 
 
進入會場會議室時正在進行倒數第三個人次的簡報，還好趕得上會場的時段。簡報過程很順利，因為都是自己親自
