摘要 
大部份臨床使用的生物可分解性高分子多屬僵硬材料，伸展性不足，有很高的楊氏係數及低的延伸率，
不適合應用於生醫材料。聚乳酸(PLA)因其生物相容性及可分解性常被用做生醫材料，但在應用其物性
及機械性能乃有待加強。為改進其柔韌性及機械性能，本計畫研究多種反應條件，我們發現以合成方
式將 PLA 與 2-甲基丙烯醯氧乙基異氰酸酯(2-methacryloyloxyethyl isocyanate，MOI)共聚，可得到韌性
極佳的改質 PLA，延伸率為未改質 PLA 的 20 倍，impact resistance 也改進 1.6 倍。所以這種改質的 PLA
高分子材料可應用於需要有韌性的生醫材料。

Ductile PLA modified with methacryloyloxyalkyl isocyanate improves 
mechanical properties 
Abstract 
The majority of the biodegradable polymers in clinical use are composed of stiff materials that exhibit 
limited extendibility with unsuitably high Young’s modulus and low elongation at break values that make 
them non-optimal for various biomedical applications. Polylactide (PLA) is often used as a biomedical 
material because it is biodegradable, but the physical and mechanical properties of PLA need to be improved 
for biomedical applications. In order to improve the flexibility and strength of biodegradable PLA, various 
reaction conditions were studied. Urethane structure polymer materials were prepared; PLA was reacted with 
a small amount of methacryloyloxyethyl isocyanate (MOI) to obtain a ductile PLA with markedly improved 
mechanical properties. Elongation at break increased by 20 times when compared to neat PLA. Impact 
resistance (notched) improved 1.6 times. Thus, this modified PLA biodegradable polymer may have greater 
application as a biomedical material with increased mechanical properties.

2. Experimental 
 
2.1. Materials 
Polylactide (PLA) (product NCP0003) was purchased from NatureWorks. 2-methacryloyloxyethyl 
isocyanate was obtained from Showa Denko. High purity toluene (HPLC grade) was purchased from Tedia 
and used as received. 98% benzoyl peroxide (BPO) was obtained from Yuh Tzong Enterprise. 
2.2. Synthesis of MOI modified PLA polymer 
 15 g of PLA was dissolved in 105 g of toluene while stirring at 85
o
C in a 500 mL round-bottom flask 
purged with nitrogen. Various amounts of MOI (0.45, 0.75, or 1.5 g) and BPO (0.045g) were added. The 
mixture was stirred for 8-12 h and the temperature was maintained at 105
o
C.  
The final mixture was spread onto glass plates to obtain modified PLA films. The films were vacuum 
dried at 60
o
C for 2 h to remove solvent in a pre-heated forced air oven. The films (with a thickness of 
50~60μm) were cooled and stripped from the plates. To measure impact strength, these films were hot pressed 
to make Izod-type test specimen according to ASTM D256. 
IR: 699 (N-H), 816 (C=CH2), 1,094 (vs, C-O-C), 1,188 (vs,C-N, (CO)-O), 1,359 (CH), 1,449 (CH3), 1,643 
(C=C), 1,758 cm
−1
 (vs, C=O). 
 
2.3. Characterization 
 
1
H and 
13
C NMR spectra were performed on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent. 
Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Bio-Rad Digilab FTS-40 spectrometer. An Instron 
universal tester model 3369 was used to study the stress-strain behavior. The load cell used was 5 Kg and the 
crosshead rate was 5 mm/min. Measurements were performed with film specimens (1.35 cm wide, 6 cm long 
and 50~60 μm thick). Impact strength was measured by an Izod impact tester according to ASTM D256. 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA at a heating rate of 
20
o
C/min in N2. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data were obtained from a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 
Diamond DSC. Samples were scanned at a heating rate of 10
 o
C /min under N2. The Tg values were measured 
as the change of the specific heat in the heat flow curves. Molecular weight was determined by gel permeation 
chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene calibration using a Perkin-Elmer series 200 HPLC system equipped 
with a Jordi Gel DVB column at 40
o
C. Since the modified material is insoluble in THF, we dissolved the 
material in chloroform first and then mixed it with THF, prior to filtration and injection into GPC. The melt 
index was measured by a melt flow indexer GT-7100-MIB manufactured by GOTECH. Test procedure 
followed ASTM D1238 and the load was 2.16Kg. X-ray diffractograms (XRD) were obtained at room 
temperature on a Rigaku RINT 2000 instrument, using Ni-filtered CuKα radiation (40 kV, 100 mA). The 
morphologies of the polymer materials were observed with a JEOL JSM-6700 scanning electron microscope 
with an accelerating voltage of 3-5 kV. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1. Structure and NMR Characterization 
 Based on the chemical structures of PLA and MOI, a reaction scheme was shown in Scheme 1a. Fig. 1 
shows the 
1
H NMR spectra of PLA, MOI and the modified polymer. Upon synthesis, MOI [δ = 1.97 (CH3), 
3.56 (m, CH2-NCO), 4.28 (m, CH2-O(C=O)R), 5.63, 6.18 (CH2=)] reacted with PLA [δ = 1.58 (m, CH3), 5.17 
(m, CH)] and formed a modified PLA. However, after further investigation, we found that there was a small 
degree of crosslinking; 
13
C and DEPT 135-NMR spectra revealed that δ72.4 is the position for a quaternary 
carbon atom (Fig. 2). Also, from heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC) spectrum (Fig. 3), we 
demonstrate that this compound has 
2
J correlation between δ72.4 and CH2 (δ1.67). An alternate reaction 
scheme was proposed, as shown in Scheme 1b. All of the spectroscopic data obtained were in agreement with 
the proposed structure.

An 8 h reaction time was chosen because modified PLA exhibited better mechanical properties at that 
reaction time than at 6 or 10 h. The molecular weight measurements (by GPC) also demonstrated that the Mw 
and Mn of modified PLA increased with a reaction time up to 8 h. Mw increased from 15.4 ×10
4
 (PLA) to more 
than 17 × 10
4
, and then gradually decreased after 8 h.  
Our results clearly show that reacting MOI with PLA is very effective for overcoming the brittleness 
of PLA and results in significant improvement in mechanical properties. 
 
3.3. Thermal properties of modified PLA 
Fig. 5 shows the DSC traces for the original PLA sample and MOI modified materials following 
heating to 200°C and subsequent quenching. It is to be noted that all samples were characterized by a glass 
transition temperature (Tg), and melting peak (Tm), typical of semi-crystalline polymers. The values for these 
transitions are recorded in Table 2. Also listed in this table are estimates of the degree of crystallinity of these 
samples (χc%) calculated using a value of 87 J g
–1
 for the heat of fusion of the pure PLLA crystal [21]. The 
data shows that Tm of modified PLA materials decreases slightly with the addition of various amount of MOI. 
This trend is also reflected in the crystallinity. For the thermal decomposition of PLA materials, the 10% 
thermal decomposition temperature (Td, 10%) reduced slightly from 357
o
C (PLA) to 342
 o
C for PLA modified 
with 10% MOI (Table 2). Td, 10% also decreased with increased reaction time, which can be attributed to the 
thermal degradation of PLA at longer reaction times due to its thermal instability. The heat deformation 
temperature (HDT) for these PLA materials reduced slightly from 71
o
C of PLA to 69
 o
C of 10% MOI 
modified material. These results indicate that the improvements in mechanical properties of PLA were 
achieved without sacrificing the thermal properties. 
 The melt index (MI) of modified PLA showed significant improvement as depicted in Fig. 6. At 240
o
C, 
which is the operating temperature for melt-spun PLA, the MI for PLA modified with 5% MOI was 106.5 
versus 68 for PLA alone. This indicates that the modified PLA material is suitable for textile processing to 
make biomedical materials.

3.4. Morphology of ductile PLA 
The morphology of the ductile PLA materials was examined by XRD and SEM. XRD showed the 
strongest diffraction peak at 2θ=16.9o, corresponding to the (200,110) reflection of the α-form crystals. As the 
data in Table 2 shows, the crystallinity of modified PLA decreases slightly with the addition of various 
amount of MOI. This trend was also reflected in the Tm data. 
The morphology of the fractured surfaces (from stress-strain test) was elucidated by SEM to 
investigate the microstructure of modified materials. The SEM in Fig. 7a-b compared the fractured surface of 
5% MOI modified film to pristine PLA. In Fig. 7a, pristine PLA showed a smooth and dense morphology. 
Minor cracks were observed, as a result of cutting brittle PLA. When MOI was reacted with PLA to prepare 
the modified polymer material, the morphology of the fractured surfaces changed substantially. Instead of a 
roughened surface, the cut surface of the modified PLA showed no cracks and exhibited a finely 
interconnected ant nest structure (Fig. 7b). The microstructure of MOI modified PLA material is another 
indication that reacting MOI with PLA makes ductile PLA materials.

As the application in biomedical materials steadily expands, the research interest in 
biodegradable PLA continues to grow
1-3
. Though PLA is biodegradable, its physical and 
mechanical properties need to be improved for biomedical application. In addition, the stress 
field induced by the implant largely affects the healing and remodelling of the natural tissue 
surrounding it, therefore, tailoring the implant so that its mechanical behaviour mimics that of 
the host tissue, is of utmost importance
4-5
. Since the vast majority of the biodegradable 
polymers in clinical use are rather stiff materials exhibiting limited extendibility, they are 
unsuitable for use in numerous applications. Aiming to expand the clinical applicability of 
biodegradable polymers, many researchers have worked to improve the toughness of PLA
6-8
. 
We have developed a family of toughening biodegradable polymers for use as biomedical 
materials, tailored to meet various applications. 
 
In order to improve the flexibility and toughness of biodegradable PLA, various 
combinations of reaction conditions were studied. Urethane structure polymer materials were 
prepared; PLA was reacted with small amount of methacryloyloxyethyl isocyanate (MOI) to 
obtain a remarkable tough PLA. These synthesized biodegradable polymers have displayed 
enhanced mechanical properties, with tensile strength values around 400 MPa, elongation at 
break values >15%, and improved biocompatibility. Thus, these modified biodegradable 
polymers can be applied as biomedical materials.
