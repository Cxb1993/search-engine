for low power by disabling unnecessary blocks. 
This report is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the overview of the digital hearing aid. 
Section III shows the detail of each component. 
Section IV presents the architecture and chip 
implementation. Section V concludes this report. 
Overview of the proposed Digital 
Hearing Aid 
0 illustrates the block diagram of the proposed 
digital hearing aid.  It includes analysis and 
synthesis filter bank (AFB and SFB), noise 
reduction stage (NR), insertion gain stage (IG) and 
WDRC. The AFB and SFB are used for frequency 
decomposition and reconstruction, respectively. 
Based on the decomposed subband signal, NR 
removes noise by discriminates signal into proper 
types to improve speech quality and intelligibility. 
Following the NR, the IG amplifies its input signal 
in a frequency-dependent way, whereas the WDRC 
adjusts dynamic range of signal to the perceptible 
range of hearing impaired person by successive gain 
adjustment. The digital hearing aid provides 18 
subbands for decomposition, noise reduction and 
gain insertion, then three channels are formed for 
WDRC.

Algorithmic Optimization for Each 
Component 
Filter Bank 
The Mandarin-specific hearing aid algorithm 
adopts the 22nd ~ 39th 1/3-octave bands in the ANSI 
S1.11 standard [3.1], which well match the human 
hearing characteristics. However, a straightforward 
FIR design of these 1/3-octave filters that are shown 
in 0(a) has extremely high complexity (e.g. the 22nd 
1/3-octave band in the ANSI S1.11 standard requires 
a 1,488-tap FIR filter). Here we use Fn to denote the 
n
th
 1/3-octave band. Since the 1/3-octave bands are 
logarithmically spaced, they fit naturally with the 
multi-rate strategy.  We propose a multi-rate 
algorithm [3.2], which is depicted in 0(b), to 
implement this filter bank.  The proposed 
multi-rate algorithm consists of three filters in the 
highest octave (i.e. F37 ~ F39) as well as a low-pass 
decimation filter, which is denoted by D.  The 
input samples for smaller octaves are obtained by 
recursively band-limiting and sub-sampling the 
input signals.  Then the three filters F37 ~ F39 are 
used to calculate each bands’ outputs. 
The detailed design of the multirate filter bank 
algorithm and the synthesis of coefficients are 
described in [1.7]. Note that this multirate filter bank 
requires a synthesis filter bank to merge each band’s 
signal. We design a synthesis bank [3.1] in which an 
interpolation filter with 41 taps was used to 
eliminate the image component due to up-sampling. 
The proposed multirate algorithm saves 96% of 
multiplications thereby reducing the power 
consumption greatly. 
Wide Dynamic Range Compression 
In the auditory compensation algorithm for 
hearing aids [1.1], a 3-channel WDRC system is 
applied to fit the signal into the impaired hearing 
range. 0 illustrates the signal processing of WDRC 
in a signal channel.  
The three functional blocks of the compressor 
shown in 0(a) operate as follows. First, the SPL 
(Speech Pressure Level) calculation block computes 
the input SPL with the following equation

where xn is the input sample and m is the

ms window is chosen in our design and thus m is 96 
for 24KHz sampling rate. Second, the gain 
estimation block calculates the expected gain for

Low-power Implementation 
Filter Bank 
The architecture of the proposed ANSI S1.11 
1/3-octave multirate filter bank is shown in 0[3.1], 
which operates at a 24KHz sampling rate with 16-bit 
data word length. Several low-power optimizations 
are applied to minimize the power consumption. 
First, clock gating is used to save the power of the 
memory and MAC blocks. Second, we use the 
selective negation technique [3.1] that reduces the 
switching probability of the MAC block. To verify 
the power compensation, a filter bank chip is taped 
out with 0.13 um process. According to the 
measurement results, the proposed filter bank 
module with the applied low-power optimization 
saves 55% power and consumes only 79uW [3.1]. 
Note that the synthesis filter bank uses a similar 
architecture. 
Wide Dynamic Range Compression 
In our design, the main power saving of WDRC 
comes from the algorithmic optimizations, so we use 
a rather simple and straightforward architecture for 
WDRC [1.7]. The gate-level synthesis results show 
that 96% area complexity reduction is achieved by 
using look-up-tables to replace the logarithm and 
exponential operators.  
Noise Reduction 
Considering flexibility, and the low data rate 
and high leakage of target process, a folded 
architecture is adopted. 0 
  
Figure 1. 5 Architecture of the S1.11 1/3-octave filter bank  
 
Figure 1. 6 The hardware architecture of the proposed noise 
reduction 
illustrates the hardware architecture of the proposed 
algorithm. Among the components, the arithmetic 
unit which is controlled by the computation 
scheduling control, is used for the computations of 
denoise processor and VAD. The data pre-processor 
is in charge of absolute value computation and 
sliding window operation for power saving. Finally, 
a Ping-Pong buffer which consists of two SRAM, is 
adopted for efficient data storage.  
SRAM 
The hearing aid chip requires 14 SRAM 
modules that feature a single-end 8T SRAM cell 
[1.9] with single bit-line and static Read-out buffer, 
a novel asymmetrical Write-assist cell virtual 
ground (VGND) biasing scheme, and a positive 
feedback sensing keeper. These four features make 
the SRAM module works at low operating voltage 
and dissipate low power. First, the Read and Write 
operations of the single-end 8T SRAM cell shares 
the same BL to reduce active BL switching power, 
hence reducing one half of the active power for 
bit-line switching. Second, for Read operation, the 
8T cell uses a static Read-out buffer (M6 and M7). 
The buffer isolates Read path from cell storage node 
to eliminate Read disturb. Therefore, the static noise 
margin in Read mode is the same as that in Standby 
mode, thus facilitating low voltage operation. In 
addition, due to the static Read-out buffer, it is not 
necessary to precharge the bit-line and the circuit 
consumes power only when the Read-out data 
changes.  
Third, in single-ended scheme, the Q node 
voltage suffers from VT loss through NMOS access 
transistor, hence inducing Write fail. To solve this 
problem, the proposed asymmetrical cell VGND 
biasing scheme only floats the M4 source node 
during Write operation. This scheme mitigates the 
M4/M5 voltage dividing effect without increasing 
the threshold voltage of M2 and the trip voltage of 
the left inverter. Therefore, Q node is easier 
precharged to turn on M2. Until M2 is turned on, the 
feedback process starts to flip the cell storage data 
and complete Write “1” operation. The proposed 
scheme offers over twice improvement in Write 
Margin which is compared with the traditional 
single bit-line structure, and achieves almost the 
same Write Margin as the dual bit-line 6T cell at 
low supply voltage. Furthermore, the Write 
 10 
designed for Mandarin user. The hearing aid 
consists of filter bank, insertion gain stage, and 
WDRC for the new Mandarin-specific auditory 
compensation algorithm, and noise reduction based 
on entropy and VAD is used to improve speech 
quality and intelligibility. We reduce the power 
consumption of these algorithms through algorithm 
and architecture optimization. In addition, a low 
power SRAM that can operate at 0.6V is designed 
for data storage. Moreover, several strategies such as 
multi-clock domain, bypass mode, and voltage 
scaling are also adopted for low power requirement. 
A clocking&handshake circuit is designed to insure 
data transmission among different clock domains. 
The chip measurement shows that the hearing aid 
consumes 314uW at 0.6V.

Introduction 
The population of suffering from hearing loss 
has steadily risen during past decades, so the 
development of advanced hearing-aids (HA) has 
become more demanding. The algorithm and 
implementation of a filterbank and the auditory 
compensation for a low power digital HA were 
proposed in [3.1] [3.2]. Combined with spectral 
subtraction noise cancellation technique which 
improves SNR by 6.27dB was also proposed in a 
monaural HA setup in [3.3]. In this paper, we 
incorporate an Independent Component Analysis 
(ICA) algorithm into a binaural HA setup as a high 
SNR improvement noise cancellation or a blind 
source separation (BSS) technique with the low 
power design for Mandarin speakers. 
  
The binaural setup is currently the developing 
mainstream of the HA due to its effective 
assistance to patients as shown in numerous 
researches [3.4] [3.5]. It is very natural to wear a 
binaural HA. Firstly, 80% of the hearing loss 
happens in both ears and the localization 
information, which is an important clue for hearing, 
is acquired by two ears. Besides, two sounds give a 
balanced feeling to the hearing loss people. Such 
balanced hearing might provide better sound 
quality, another key performance index of the HA.  
 
In a binaural HA, there is at least one 
microphone on each side. Such setup provides an 
opportunity for us to consider BSS algorithms on 
two sources to extract speech from noisy 
environments. Our assumption is that the desired 
source, usually a voice, is in the median plane (a 
plane with equal distances to two ears) of the 
hearing impaired person. It is a reasonable 
assumption that people always talk to people 
face-to-face by turning their head to the direction 
of the speaker. Meanwhile, the other source, the 
unwanted noise, would come from any directions.  
 
Our assumption is shown in Figure 3.1. This is 
the worst case for ICA to extract median-plane 
voice because the noise would lead to the most 
delays between two microphones. These delays 
make BSS-based noise cancellation fail [3.6]. In 
this paper, we propose a delay compensation 
scheme to make the BSS-based noise cancellation 
work. In short, our method restores the front-side 
voice in the case where noise delays exist between 
microphones and then sends the cleared voice to 
the HA to accomplish the noise cancellation task.    
 
The BSS algorithm can separate mixtures to 
obtain a recovery of the “front-side signal” and 
provide patients with better intelligibility. However, 
there are some issues in the real application of a 
binaural HA, such as the low power design, the 
robustness in different SNRs and noise sources, 
and the real-time implementations. Our algorithm 
 18 
recording to make the most prominent noise signal 
coherent between mixtures and our desired signal 
from the median plane incoherent. This will ensure 
the InfomaxICA pick up our desired source. The 
time period of our shift is estimated by a 
time-domain correlation. There is a peak to 
represent the most likely delay amount for noise 
sources. The delay estimation would have better 
accuracy when more data points are used, which 
unfortunately consumes more power. This is a 
trade-off between the low power and the accuracy 
of the shift estimation. The flow chart for solving 
this delay problem is shown in Figure 3.3. By using 
this compensation, the front-side voice signal can 
be extracted from delay mixtures by the 
InfomaxICA.       
     
Another consideration is whether this strategy 
can tackle the worst case, where the noise 
generates the longest interaural delay by directly 
coming from the left or the right side. The longest 
delay tap is determined by the sampling rate and 
the distance between two microphones as shown in 
Table 3.I. The faster the system sampling rate, the 
longer the delay tap is required. In our simulations, 
35 points are used to cover the longest delay in all 
possible conditions.  It certainly exceeds the 
largest Interaural Time Difference (ITD), 690 µs, 
from human subjects in binaural psychoacoustic 
experiments.

Minimum-Interference Initial Guess Algorithm 
for Fast Convergence 
Initial guess for any adaptation algorithm is very 
critical for its convergence. Bad initial conditions 
lead to worsen results or even failure of the 
adaptive algorithm in searching for the global 
optimal solution. There are not many researches to 
discuss this issue about the initial condition for 
InfomaxICA. In this section, we propose a 
minimum-interference initial condition guess for 
InfomaxICA. The mixtures after preprocessing 
become two uncorrelated mixtures. The statistical 
properties of one of the uncorrelated mixtures are 
like those from voice, while the properties of the 
other one are like those from noise, as 
demonstrated in Figure 3.4. Equation (3.4), which 
links the uncorrelated mixtures Z and the 
de-mixing matrix W, provides hints for a good 
guess of the initial condition.

In (3.4), each output Y is derived by adding a 
portion of the other uncorrelated signal Z. 
Therefore, a better estimate of the portion from the 
other signal yields a better initial condition. For 
example, if Z1

point to 35 points. The positive and negative delays 
indicate the noise comes from the left and right 
side, respectively. 
The simulation results with the delay 
compensation are shown in Figure 3.6. The 
SNRenhancement gets another 10 dB gain due to the 
location discrepancy between speech and noise. 
Although Figure 3.6 only shows results for positive 
delays, negative delays also have consistent and 
symmetric results. Here, all possible delay 
situations are verified and our proposed algorithms 
produce great improvement in SNRenhancement. 
 
Delay Compensation for Different Mixture 
Delays in Different SNRs 
Finally, the last scenario, which combines the 
second and the third simulations, is examined for 
various delays (5 to 30 points with a 5-point step) 
and various SNRs (-10 dB to 10 dB with a 5-dB 
step). This scenario contains all possible HA 
wearing environments and simulation results are 
shown in Figure 3.7. Basically, results from Table 
III and Figure 3.6 are consistent with that in Figure 
7. Figure 3.8 shows the Mandarin speech recovered 
from the worst case of a 30-point delay with the 
-10 dB SNR. The silences between words in Fig 
8(b) evidently demonstrate a very good recovery 
by our algorithms.

Conclusion 
A low power real-time InfomaxICA algorithm 
for binaural HA is proposed in this paper. The 
problems and limitations to this medical 
application are discussed and resolved. Numerous 
simulations demonstrate our proposed algorithms 
achieve very good signal recovery even in very low 
SNR noisy environments, 20.5 to 30.6 dB gain at 0 
to 35 points delay at SNR= 0 dB and 31.6 dB gain 
at 30 points delay at SNR= -10 dB. In summary, 
combining our novel algorithms in this work, the 
InfomaxICA provides great SNR enhancements for 
binaural HA.

一、 參加會議經過: 
 
ICBECS 2010 於今年的十月二十五號到十月二十六號於中國廈門舉辦。本會議
是由國際電子電機工程師會(IEEE)與中國武漢大學等單位主辦。參加的人員主要
來自中國大陸的教授、學生、企業人士，及少數的外國教授如英國里得大學的教
授。這次的會議共計二天，其順序如下，開幕式，團體合照，keynote(資訊隱藏
系統，神經系統相關的 winner -take-all )，口頭報告，餐會，閉幕式。這個會議
主要是生物資訊相關的訊號處理，所以有人提出相當新穎的生物影像訊號處理、
濾波器設計、助聽器語音處理、生物數學模型…等。此論文集一共收錄了六十篇
左右，其中被選出來口頭報告的約有二十幾篇。 
 
 
二、 與會心得 
 
ICBECS 2010 主要是生物影像訊號處理的會議。在這個會議中，學生在各國學
生的口頭報告中，會去尋找是否有相關新的研究題目，及找出口頭報告中是否有
不清楚的地方，來發問。在會議中，去學習如何在多人之中用英文來表答。在這
種訓練下，學生覺得參加會議很有收獲，因為在這個訓練過程中，會特別專注在
別人的演講，相當有用。其次，在會議 break time，可以親自與研究學者討論，
籍如這種方式，就能認識他們，說不定以後還有機會可以合作。 另一個感想是
在吃飯時，因為有些是中國人，所以交流是直接使用中文，這又是一個很特別的
經驗，因為一般的國際會議都是要使用英文。最後，覺得參加會議真的能讓學生
增加研究的廣度，了解國際上的趨勢。
