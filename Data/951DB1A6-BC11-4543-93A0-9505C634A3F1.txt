is integration of information technologies, people, 
business processes organization, innovation and 
facilities into strategic competitive capabilities. To be 
truly agile, an enterprise must integrate logically and 
deploy a number of distinguishing agility enablers 
with agility drivers and agility capabilities well and, 
finally transform company into strategic competitive 
edges. Thus in order to assure that the agility enablers 
can satisfy an agile enterprise’s strategic direction, a 
systematic approach needs to be followed which 
allows an enterprise to develop and deploy its agility 
capabilities and agility enablers.  
Many approaches have been proposed for agile 
enterprise planning but few systematic methodologies 
have been developed. Quality function deployment 
(QFD) provides an excellent tool for integrating the 
important concepts and linking those steps and, 
fuzzy-logic is a useful tool to analyze imprecise and 
vague phenomena. To assist managers in better 
achieving agility, an integrated method, based on 
fuzzy-logic and QFD concept, is devised to provide a 
means of linking the perspectives from agility drivers 
and, agility capabilities and agility enablers, 
measuring how agile an enterprise is as well as 
identifying the principal obstacles to improve agility. 
   
2. The conceptual model of agile enterprise 
An agile enterprise’ goal is to enrich/satisfy 
customers and employees. An enterprise essentially 
possesses a set of capabilities to make appropriate 
response to changes taking place in its business 
environment. However, the business conditions in 
which many companies find themselves are 
characterized by volatile and unpredictable demand; 
thus, the increasing urgency in pursuing agility. 
Agility might, therefore, be defined as the capability 
of an enterprise to respond rapidly to changes in 
market and customers’ demands. To be truly agile, an 
enterprise should possess a number of distinguishing 
agile-enablers. From a review of normative literature, 
the author has developed a conceptual model of agile 
enterprise, as shown in Figure 1, culminating in many 
research propositions.
 
The main driving force behind agility is change. 
There is nothing new about change; today’s change is 
taking place much faster than ever before. Turbulence 
and uncertainty in the business environment have 
become the main cause of failures in the 
manufacturing industry. The number of changes and 
their type, specification or characteristics cannot 
easily be determined and is probably is indefinite.

3. A practical case study 
3.1 Subject of case study 
“A-company” is an internationally recognized 
IT products and services company, particularly noted 
for PC and notebooks. In the 1990’s, IT products’ 
markets matured and low cost production in 
developing nations grew, thus causing large 
multinational firms to simultaneously provide local 
responsiveness and global integration to respond to 
an uncertain business environment. These changes 
challenged “A-company” profoundly. To achieve and 
sustain global success and satisfy new small niche 
markets, “A-company” strived to become a global 
major supplier to enrich its customers, reduce time to 
market, lower total cost of ownership, and enhance 
overall competitiveness.  
Since agile enterprise has been seen as the 
winning strategy to become national and international 
leaders, the corporate management team (the 
executive team) concluded that it wished to achieve 
an extremely-agile enterprise through continuous 
improvement processes, and an assessment team was 
organized and led by the executive vice president to 
do this. The assessment team was selected from key 
personnel who mastered the knowledge of agile 
enterprise as they know more about the problems of 
the company than anyone else does, and because it is
