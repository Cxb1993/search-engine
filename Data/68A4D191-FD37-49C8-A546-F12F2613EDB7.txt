Abstract Keywords: Handwriting, dysgraphia, motor learning, motor control
Children with handwriting problems of sufficient severity to interfere with the performance of
their school work have been recognized as representing a distinct and identifiable syndrome. The
most commonly noted feature of the handwriting deficit population is its heterogeneity. Most of
the current handwriting research has addressed the complexity of handwriting deficits; i.e.,
complex perceptual and motor control processing. To answer these questions, research into the
search for a complete computerized evaluation is indeed necessary. The handwriting problems of
elementary schoolchildren are investigated in this study. The temporal and kinematical
parameters of handwriting movement analysis in children with handwriting deficits were
collected and analyzed. In the temporal parameters, the differences between the two groups in the
In-air or On-paper time were not significant. In the kinematic parameters, the differences between
the two groups in the On-paper trajectory length were not significant. Between the two groups, a
significant difference was found in the In-air trajectory length. In summary, the In-air trajectory
length could be an indicator for the evaluation of handwriting problem.
Introduction
Handwriting is an integral skill that is related to most of every child's school activities. From
a survey on the activities in an elementary school classroom, 30% to 60% of the time is spent in
fine motor activities, with handwriting predominating over other tasks (McHale & Cermak, 1992).
From another survey on the occupational therapy service in elementary school, the most common
referrals were handwriting problems (Schneck & Hendsron, 1990; Reisman, 1991; Tseng &
Cermak, 1993). Although the etiology and epidemiology of handwriting deficit are not clearly
understood now, children with motor dyspraxia or other perceptual-motor problems were found
prone to be affected with academic learning problems, especially in the lessons related to
handwriting activities (Roussounis, Gaussen, Stratton, 1987; Willoughby & Polatajko, 1995;
Miller, Missiuna, Macnab, Malloy-Miller, & Polatajko, 2001; Smits-Engelsman, Niemeijer, &
Van Galen, 2001).
Handwriting deficits may result from the interlinked processes of cognitive, psychosocial,
sensorimotor, finemotor skill, visual, or auditory functions. The completion of the handwriting
evaluation includes interviews with the teachers of students, the inspection of children’s
listening writing test, far point copy, and near point copy. In addition to performance tests, Tseng
has developed a checklist for Chinese handwriting problem called the Tseng Handwriting
Problem Checklist (THPC). Through the study of factorial validity, she found the THPC is an
effective tool for observing dimensions of construction, sequence, behavior, accuracy motor, and
directionality. She found more than moderate correlation between motor, accuracy and
construction components. She believes the three components have reliable concurrent validity in
evaluation of handwriting problems (Tseng, 1993ab).
Different to conventionally clinical evaluation, computerized evaluation provides the
handwriting evaluation much more quantitative approaches. From the studies of Van Galen’s
(1993) and Van Galen, Portier, Smits-Engelsman, and Schomaker’s (1993). They suggested that
clumsy children may devote considerable attention to the construction of the immediate stroke
thereby detracting from their readiness to plan and produce the next stroke. Smits-Engelsman, et.
al. (1994a) have also suggested three possible explanations for the “dysfluencies”or the “noise”
phenomenon that characterizes poor handwriting. The first is that poor handwriting may reflect a
breakdown of kinesthetic input to the inhibitory system (Laszlo, Bairstow, & Bartrip, 1988;
Laszlo & Broderick, 1991) or a breakdown in visual feedback processing (Askov, Otto, & Askov,
1970; Pecj, Askov, Fairchild, 1980). The second suggestion was that poor handwriting might be a
product of general cognitive deficiency that becomes manifest when child attempt to combine
abstract mental operations (such as those involved in the use of language) with the act of writing.
The third explanation was that poor writers, rather than being motorically impaired, suffered from
delay in psychomotor maturation.
In selecting the observational parameters in computerized evaluation, many studies were
devoted to identify which parameters has the potential to differentiate the proficient and
non-proficient handwriters. Kinematics of the children’s movements may be of help to gain
insight into the causes of failure to produce an acceptable movement product. Smits-Engelsman
et. al., (2001) found the non-proficient writers wrote with greater velocity and finished the task in
less time than proficient writer. A movement strategy that has been observed in impaired children
is that of slowing down the end-effector speed, leading to a slower overall movement
performance (Schoemaker et al., 1994b). Another movement strategy brought by Van Galen et al.
(1997) based on the theory that poor writers are characterized by increased levels of noise in the
neuromotor system. Poor writers filter their noisy motor commands through the application of an
enhanced limb stiffness regime, either by increasing movement speed (phasic stiffness), or by
scaling up muscular co-contraction (tonic stiffness).
Wann and Jones (1986) did not find mean total time to be a good differentiator between two
groups of proficient and non-proficient grade 4 and 5 children. Sovik et. al. (1987a) also found
that proficient handwriters paused for less time than non-proficient handwriters while writing
single words as did Wann and Jones (1986) who suggested that this phenomenon, rather than total
time, is a good indicator of writing difficulties. Schoemaker and Smits-Engelsman (1997) also
found poor handwriter drew more slowly and paused longer between strokes than the control
group. Rosenblum et al. (2003) also suggested the longer pause is a better indicator than writing
speed. Similar results were found in the drawing of dysgraphic children.
Other contextual factors influencing a skilled handwriting movement include variations in
task length (Rosenblum, Parush, & Weiss, 2001), task type (letters versus writing patterns) (Mojet,
1991), task familiarity (Smits-Engelsman, Van Galen, & Portier, 1994b), and task continuity
(Meulenbroek & Van Galen, 1984; Kosterman, Westzaan, & Van Wieringen, 1994). These factors
all appear to have a great influence on skilled handwriting performance. Rosenblum et al. (2003)
noted the importance to assess whether the pause phenomenon is age- or task-dependent and to
identify when it occurs within the writing sequence, e.g., between successive segments of a letter,
successive letters, and successive words in a sentence, and with what frequency. They also noted
the importance to characterize what occurs during pauses and whether the pen is held stationary
in the air or on the paper or whether it is being manipulated above the writing surface.
Rosenblum et al. (2003) found that the difference of “in air”time between familiar and
unfamiliar tasks were recommended for checking the proficient of handwriting performance.
They also found the key differences between the samples of poor and proficient writers were
poorly spaced and of irregular size and placement in poor handwriting sample. It is difficult for
poor handwriter to draw horizontal lines, often veering upwards or downwards. Much of
III. Handwriting tasks
During the test, the tasks will be presented visually on an A4 sized paper in front of the
subjects. There are three writing tasks including 25-character near point copy, 25-character far
point copy, and a 100-character-long paragraph. The model and paragraph are both presented in
Chinese. The models for tasks of near and far point and short paragraph copies are from
Psychological Publishing Co., Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan. Each task will be copied on test sheets
presented on another page and test sheet to the children.
IV. Outcome measures
1. The primary outcome measures
The variables of direct outcome measures in this study include total task time, on-paper
time, in-air time, on-paper length, in-air length, mean stroke velocity, mean writing speed. The
definitions of these parameters are listed as bellow.
Total task time: From the start of movement to the completion of the task, the total time
period the subject spends.
On-paper time: Within the task period, the accumulating time as the pen-tip contacts the test
sheet on the digital tablet.
In-air time: Within the task period, the accumulating time as the pen-tip does not contact the
test sheet on the digital tablet.
On-paper length: Within the task period, the accumulating length as the pen-tip contacts the
test sheet on the digital tablet (The length of trajectory on the paper).
In-air length: Within the task period, the accumulating length as the pen-tip does not contact
the test sheet on the digital tablet (The length of trajectory above the paper).
Mean stroke velocity: Within a stroke, the mean displacement between two successive
samples divides by the sample period (10 ms).
Mean writing speed: The mean number of words within the total task time period.
Mean pause times per character: The mean number of pauses within the total task time
period.
2. The derived outcome measures
In the movement analysis, the variables derived from the primary outcome measures
include the mean on-paper time as a percent of total time, the mean in-air time as a percent of
total time, the mean on-paper length as a percent of total length, the mean in-air length as a
percent of total length.
V. Test procedure
During the test, the participants will be seated on a comfortable position. The digital tablet
will be positioned horizontally in front of the subjects. The examiner sits next to the subject and
gives instruction to guide the progression of test. The subjects (good and poor handwriters)
were requested to copy every task in a limited time period of 2 minutes for near and far point
copies and 5 minutes for short paragraph task. The participants will be tested individually. The
total test time is about 15 minutes.
VI. Data Analysis
Two-way analysis of variance was used to test for the group differences (non-proficient versus
proficient handwriters) across tasks. The interaction between the two factors (group and task) will
be examined and analyzed. The significant differences between groups were subjected to
univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Matched measures student t test will be used to test for the group differences (non-proficient
versus proficient handwriters) across tasks (near or far point copy and paragraph). The significant
difference is set at=0.05.
