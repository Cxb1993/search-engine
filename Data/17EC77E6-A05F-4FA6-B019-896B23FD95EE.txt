Abstract: 
Ag/Pd triangular nanoshells of different sizes are prepared for catalyzing electroless copper 
deposition. As supported by the analysis of quartz crystal microbalance and mixed potential 
theory, the alloy nanoshells can be successfully used as new activators and have the excellent 
activity for electroless copper bath. For a comparison of deposition rates with a system of 
triangular Ag/Pd nanoshells, the large Ag/Pd nanoshell is found to have the maximum activity 
toward electroless bath.

1. Introduction: 
Electroless copper deposition (ECD) is an important technology in advanced electronic circuit 
industries, and is used for printing circuit board [1-2] and manufacturing semiconductors [3-6]. 
Although the composition of the deposition bath [7-9] and the choice of ligands [10, 11] can 
influence the performance of an electroless process, the activation is a determinant key on the 
deposition rate [12] and the surface roughness of deposited layers [13]. Activation, which is a 
catalytic reaction, is triggered with active colloids on the surface of the substrates dipped in an 
electroless deposition bath.  Therefore, the active catalyst plays a role as an electron carrier that 
supports the transfer of electrons from the reducer to the metal ions.   
Metallic nanomaterials are gained of interest because of their optical [14, 15], magnetic [16] 
and catalytic properties [17-19]. In particular, for the catalytic reaction, metallic nanomaterials of 
various size [18] and shape [20] apparently alter the catalysis rate. In the early report, we have 
prepared spherical Pd nanoparticles and apply them as an activator for ECD [21]. This study 
further explores that electrochemical activity of the Ag/Pd triangular nanoshells (Ag/Pdshell) with 
different sizes for catalyzing ECD bath. MPT and QCM are applied in cases of various sizes of 
Ag/Pdshell to compare theoretical and actual ECD kinetics. The ECD deposition rates activated by 
these Ag/Pd nanoshells can thus be fairly compared.     
2. Experimental: 
2-1. Preparation of Ag/Pd triangular nanoshells with different sizes. The synthesis of 
Ag/Pd triangular nanoshells with different sizes in aqueous solution is described below. The 
synthesis method of the dispersed Ag triangular nanotemplates is modified according to the 
seed growth method [22]. Initially, ~50 μl of a ~0.05 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) aqueous 
solution was added to 10 ml of a 2.5 ×10-4 M sodium citrate aqueous solution. Then, ~25 μl of 
~0.1 M NaBH4 solution was gradually added to a stirred mixed solution of sodium citrate and 
AgNO3. An Ag seed solution of light yellow was then obtained. Furthermore, 100μl of ~0.05 
M AgNO3 was added to 20 ml of 0.1 M hexadecyltrimethy ammonium bromide (C16TAB) 
aqueous solution. 1 ml of ~ 0.1 M ascorbic acid and ~100μl of the prepared Ag seed solution 
was slowly dropped into the C16TAB aqueous solution.  The Ag nanotemplates of middle size 
were then prepared after 80 μl of 2M NaOH aqueous solution was added. If the amounts of the 
seed solution are changed to ~50μl and ~200μl in the synthesis pathway, the Ag nanoplates of 
large and small size are then obtained, respectively. Furthermore, 20 ml of the synthesized Ag 
triangular nanoplates solution of middle size was precipitated by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm

    3. Results and discussion: 
When the Ag/Pd nanoshells were formed, HR-TEM was employed to measure the morphology 
and size of the prepared Ag/Pdshell, which are displayed on copper grids.  Figure 1 presents 
HR-TEM images of the prepared Ag/Pdshell of different sizes, which were prepared as description 
in the experimental section.  The Ag/Pdshell of small, middle and large size are detected and 
shown in Figure 1A-C, respectively.  
 
Fig 1. The Pictures of transmission electron microscope of the prepared Ag/Pd triangular 
nanoshells of different sizes. (A) Small Ag/Pdshell; (B) Middle Ag/Pdshell; (C) Large Ag/Pdshell. 
Based on HR-TEM results, the lengths of triangular edge on small, middle and large   
Ag/Pdshell are calculated and summarized in Fig. 2. The mean edge lengths upon small and 
middle Ag/Pdshell are 82.8 nm and 133.28 nm, respectively, and 193.29 nm is at the large case. 
This indicates that the sizes of Ag/Pd triangle nanoshells which are applied as new ECD 
activators can be tuned by Ag nanotemplate’s size.     
As for the catalytic potential on electroless copper deposition, the activity of triangular Ag/Pd 
nanoshells are measured, which increase with increasing hollow nanocatalyst size of small 
Ag/Pdshell < middle Ag/Pdshell < large Ag/Pdshell. Theoretically, for electroless copper deposition, 
the catalytic particles play roles as carriers in the path of transfer of electrons from reducing 
agent to copper ions in the ECD bath. The solid catalysts are thus the import factor for the 
kinetics. Mixed potential theory (MPT), which yields two Tafel curves of the anodic and 
cathodic reactions, is frequently adopted to analyze the kinetics of electroless deposition [13, 24]. 
The points of intersection between the anodic and cathodic tafel curves yield the deposition 
current and the mixed potential associated with a deposition reaction in the steady state. 
Furthermore, quartz crystal microgravimetry is a novel method for analyzing in-situ the observed 
electrochemical kinetics, based on the change in frequency of the vibration at the electrode [21]. 
Figure 4 presents the electrochemical current-potential curves of the Tafel equation of ECD 
catalyzed by small, middle and large Ag/Pdshell, which analyzed by using potentiostate.

large Ag/Pd nanoshells in the absence of either formaldehyde or Cu2+. 
 According to the mixed potential theory, the coordinates of the intersection point of anodic and 
cathodic curve are the deposition current (Ideposition) and the mixed potential, respectively, at 
which the deposition reaction steady-stately occurs. Firstly, it can be seen that the peak current of 
small Ag/Pdshell < middle Ag/Pdshell < large Ag/Pdshell in the anodic I-E curve are measured and 
observed. This indicates that large Ag/Pdshell has the maximum catalytic power toward the 
oxidation of reducing agent. The ECD deposition rate (Rmp) by mixed potential theory can be 
expressed by Faraday’s law [13] 
depositonmp IR ×= 18.1  
The measured results are summarized in Table 2. The Rmp on small Ag/Pdshell, middle Ag/Pdshell 
and large Ag/Pdshell are about ~0.026, ~0.039 and ~0.041 μg/cm2⋅s, respectively, showing the 
order of small Ag/Pdshell < middle Ag/Pdshell < large Ag/Pdshell. The large Ag/Pdshell with 
lengthening edges shows the maximum activity. The activity of Ag/Pd triangle nanoshells 
increases with the lengthening of edge lengths. It is plausible that the edge sites of Ag/Pd 
nanoshells play as an important role as active sites on electroless copper bath. 
4. Conclusion: 
 Ag/Pd triangular nanoshells of different size are successfully applied as activators for 
electroless copper deposition. As supported by the analysis of QCM and mixed potential theory, 
the activity of hollow Ag/Pd triangular nanoshells shows the order of small Ag/Pdshell < middle 
Ag/Pdshell < large Ag/Pdshell on electroless copper bath. A comparison of deposition rate with a 
system of triangular Ag/Pd nanoshells, the large Ag/Pdshell is found to exhibit maximum activity 
toward oxidation of formaldehyde, reducing agent of ECD.
