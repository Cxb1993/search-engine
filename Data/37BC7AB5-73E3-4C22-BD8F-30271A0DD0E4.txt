一、前言 
In recent years, neural networks have been used in 
many practical applications, such as optimization, recognition, 
prediction, diagnosis, decision, association, approximation, 
and generalization.  Various neural networks have been 
investigated, such as cellular neural networks [1], 
bidirectional associative memory neural networks [2], 
Cohen-Grossberg neural networks [3], and Hopfield neural 
networks [4].  The existence of time delays is often a source 
of oscillation and instability of neural networks.  Hence the 
stability of delayed neural networks (DNNs) are important 
and significant in practical applications.  The DNNs may be 
applied in many areas including moving images processing 
and pattern classification [1-4].  In the hardware 
implementation of artificial neural networks, time delay is 
produced from the finite switching speed of electronic 
networks.  During the implementation on very large scale 
integrated chips, parameter perturbations, modeling errors, 
and transmitting time delays will destroy the stability of the 
neural networks.  Hence the stability of DNNs is considered 
by many researchers in recent years. 
 
Cellular neural networks (CNNs) were introduced by 
Chua and Yang [1].  Applications of CNN in physical 
systems include connected component detection, hole filling, 
image shadowing, associative memories, pattern recognition, 
and signal processing [5].  The delayed cellular neural 
networks (DCNN) are used in many applications including 
moving images processing and pattern classification [6].  
Depending on whether the stability criterion itself contains the 
size of delay, criteria for DCNN can be classified into two 
categories, namely, delay-dependent criteria [7-9] and 
delay-independent criteria [10-13].  Usually the former is 
less conservative when the value of delay is small.  In the 
Lyapunov-based delay-dependent results, the hard constraints 
that the variations of time-varying delays of systems are less 
than one, i.e., ( ) 1<tiτ& , ni∈ , are usually imposed on the 
time-varying delays of systems [8-9, 12].  In this study, we 
relax the constraints and delay-dependent results are 
developed by Lyapunov theory.  In [7, 13], algebraic stability 
criteria were proposed based on Halanay inequality.  In [9], 
matrix inequality conditions were presented based on 
Lyapunov theory.  In [8], delay-dependent result was applied 
by checking the Hamiltonian matrix with no eigenvalues on 
imaginary axis.  Algebraic criteria and matrix inequality 
conditions are difficult to check and it is hard to find their 
feasible solutions.  Hamiltonian matrix condition is simple, 
but it is usually conservative for some situations. 
 
In the analysis for uncertain DNNs, it is reasonable that 
the parameters assume values in some prescribed intervals.  
Such DNNs are called the interval delayed neural networks 
(IDNNs) [4, 14-18].  The stability analysis of IDNNs will be 
considered in this study.  In the Lyapunov-based 
delay-dependent results, the hard constraints that the 
variations of time-varying delays of systems are less than one, 
i.e., ( ) 1<tiτ& ni∈, , are usually imposed on the time-varying 
delays of systems [4, 15, 16, 18].  These constraints are 
relaxed and delay-dependent results have been proposed in 
this study.  In [14, 17], algebraic stability criteria were 
proposed based on Halanay inequality, Young’s inequality, 
and Lyapunov functional.  It is usually difficult to find 
feasible solutions for these algebraic criteria. 
 
LMI approach is an efficient tool in dealing with control 
problems, which can be solved by the toolbox of Matlab [19].  
Recently, LMI-based techniques have been successfully used 
to solve various stability problems for neural networks with 
constant time delays or time-varying delays [20, 21].  In this 
study, LMI-based delay-dependent and delay-independent 
criteria will be proposed by using new Lyapunov functionals.  
These LMI-based criteria are usually computationally 
efficient and flexible.  In general, our approach is useful and 
is easy to generalize to other forms of uncertain DCNN. 
 
This report is organized as follows.  The aims of 
research are introduced in section 2.  In section 3, some 
stability results of DCNN are provided.  Global exponential 
stability for a class of uncertain DCNN and interval DNN 
with multiple time-varying delays will be considered in 
section 3.  Conclusion and discussion are provided in section 
4.
