22. The Designed Procedures
Step 1: The modified end-coupled structure
Fig. 1(a) showed the basic end-coupled microstrip line structure, where the upper microstrip
line was a λ/2 cross coupling resonator with operating frequency of 5.5 GHz, and the simulated
result of return loss was shown in Fig. 2(a). For the purpose of the insertion of transmission zeros
between the pass bands, the modified end-coupled microstrip line structure with a λ/2 cross
coupling resonator was introduced, as Fig. 1(b) showed. While the total length of the upper λ/2
cross coupling resonator was unchanged, as D of the resonator fixed at 0.4 mm and the L increased
gradually, due to the variation of coupling, it was found that two transmission zeros were generated
as L great than 3 mm, and the ripple of the first harmonic could be reduced effectively, which
revealed a phenomenon of f1/fo>2. Figure 2(b) showed a better modified end-coupled wideband
filter with aλ/2 cross coupling resonator (L=2 mm and D=2.4 mm), the stop-band rejection between
two pass bands was 46 dB, and the depth of transmission zeros were 75 dB and 60 dB,
respectively. However, the major drawback for this structure was that the upper skirt of 5.2 GHz
was still not good enough.
Step 2: Using aλ/2 hairpin resonator to generate a zero
Fig. 1(c) shows end-coupled microstrip line structure with a λ/2 hairpin resonator (operating
frequency 5.2 GHz), owing to the variation of coupling, a transmission zero generated at the upper
skirt of 5.2 GHz as the size of resonator (X and Y2) increased, which could be used to low down the
upper skirt of 5.2 GHz in Fig. 2(b). As Y2 fixed at 1.8 mm and X increased, the zero would move
toward lower frequency, furthermore, the depth of zero increased as X increased, the variation of
coupling would be the reason. As X was fixed at 2.6 mm and Y2 increased, the zero would move
toward lower frequency, too. For X=2.6mm and Y2=1.8mm the designed filter would have the
optimal characteristics.
Step 3: Combining above two structures
In order to improve the upper skirt in Fig. 2(c), a λ/2 U-shaped hairpin resonator was added
into the modified end-coupled microstrip line structure to conquer the disadvantage. Theλ/2 hairpin
resonator was added on the other side of the couple line, as Fig. 1(d) shown, as the length of Y2
increased gradually, a transmission zero would be generated at the right-side of 5.2 GHz, and that
would improve the upper skirt of 5.2 GHz obviously.

6of the microwave devices which used microwave dielectric ceramics as its substrates. Microwave
dielectric ceramic exhibits high quality value (Qf value) and high dielectric constant (εr), which is
suitable for the use of high frequency devices (high Qf value) and for the miniaturization of the
devices (highεr). In this paper, the end-coupled microstrip line structure was combined with a high
impedance λ/2 cross coupling resonator [4, 5], the new type of miniature microstrip dual-band
filters were developed on the MgTa1.5Nb0.5O6 microwave dielectric ceramic substrates [6]. By
varying the size of the λ/2 cross coupling resonators (2.45 GHz), two transmission zeros would
generate beside the pass band, furthermore, the adding of a smallerλ/2 hairpin resonator (5.2 GHz)
would generate another transmission zero at the upper skirt of 5.2 GHz, which would improve the
upper skirt of 5.2 GHz up to56 dB.
2. The Design Procedures
According to the coupling technique of resonators and the combination method, the main
motivation of this paper is to develop a dual-band filter on the MgTa1.5Nb0.5O6 microwave dielectric
ceramic substrates with three transmission zeros generated in the stop-bands to modify the response
of the filter. The design procedures would be divided into three steps, and detailed discussion would
be following:
Step 1. Using a Modified End-Coupled Structure to Generate a Dual-Band (2.45 / 5.2 GHz)
BandPass Filter
Fig. 1(a) shows the pattern and the simulated result of the modified end-coupled microstrip line
structure with an upper λ/2 resonator (operating at 2.45 GHz). For the purpose of the insertion of
transmission zeros between the pass bands, the upper λ/2 resonator was modified to a λ/2 cross
coupling resonator as shown in Fig. 1(b), and the total length of the upper λ/2 resonator was
unchanged. Two transmission zeros were generated between the pass bands, the stop-band rejection
between two pass bands was46 dB, and the depth of transmission zeros were75 dB and60 dB,
respectively. However, the major drawback for this structure was that the upper skirt of 5.2 GHz
was still not good enough. Therefore, the next step would generate a transmission zero at this band
to improve it.
Step 2. Using aλ/2 Hairpin Resonator to Generate a Zero at the Upper Skirt of 5.2 GHz
Fig. 2 shows the same end-coupled microstrip line structure as in Fig. 1 but with a λ/2
U-shaped hairpin resonator, which had the operating frequency around 5.2 GHz. As the size of the
resonator (X and Y length) increased, a transmission zero was generated at the upper skirt of 5.2
GHz. This zero could be used to low down the upper skirt of 5.2 GHz in Fig. 1(b). In Fig. 2(a), as Y
was fixed at 1.8 mm and X increased (total lengthλ/2), the operating frequency and zero would
shift toward lower frequency. Furthermore, the depth of zero increased as X increased, due to the
length of theλ/2 U-shaped hairpin resonator increased and the variation of coupling. And as X was
8In this letter, the basic end-coupled microstrip line structure is combined with a 2.45 GHz λ/2
cross coupling resonator and a 5.2 GHz λ/2 U-shaped hairpin resonator to develop a miniature
dual-band filter on the MgTa1.5Nb0.5O6 microwave ceramic substrate. In this simple structure, three
transmission zeros are inserted into the stop-band, while two zeros are located between the pass
bands, and the third is located at the upper skirt of 5.2 GHz, all of these zeros improve the
characteristics of stop-band obviously, and all the insertion losses of the fabricated filter at the two
resonate frequencies are smaller than 0.65 dB due to the use of high quality factor and dielectric
constant ceramic substrates. The proposed filters are small and simple, and all the characteristics of
the filters are good enough for the applications of WLAN communication systems.

shown in Fig. 1. It just like an empty rectangle metal covering and with four
rectangular disturbed elements at four corners. The thickness of Al2O3 ceramic
substrate is 1 mm. The parameters of L3, L4 and W4 will be changed to find the
optimal characteristics of designed antennas, and other parameters are fixed as
the detailed dimensions listed in Table I (in millimeters).
Simulated and Measured Results and Discussion
Figure. 2 shows the simulated results due to the variation of the disturbed
element of W4, where the length of L4 is fixed at 5.2 mm and the length of W4
is changed. As the length of W4 increases from 1.6mm to 2.0mm, the BW
value of the second resonant frequency (fH), the value of fH and the maximum
return loss (S11) increase from 4%, 5.22GHz and -17.46 dB to 4.2%, 5.25GHz
and -20.49 dB. Further increasing the length of W4 to 2.4mm, the BW and the
value of fH are increased to 4.71% and 5.53GHz, but the S11 value is decreasd
to -14.68dB. However, for first resonant frequency (fL), the BW, the value of
fL and the S11 value are almost unchanged as the length of W4 is changed.
Therefore, the length of W4 is an important inference factor on the
characteristics of fH.
Table II shows the influences of the length of L4 on the characteristics of fH,
and W4 is fixed at 2 mm. From the simulated results, for the characteristics of
fL, the BW, the value of fL and the S11 value are also unchanged as the length
of L4 is changed. Table II shows the S11 characteristics for fH, the BW, the
value of fH and the S11 value have little changes as the length of L4 is increased.
The results shown in Fig.1 and Table II have the important inferences that the
disturbed elements of L4 and W4 have no apparent influences on the
characteristics of fL and have slight influences on the characteristics of fH.
Therefore, the errors of L4 and W4 in the fabricated procedures would not have
apparent influence on the characteristics of the fabricated antennas. From the
simulated results, the optimal lengths for L4 and W4 are 5.2mm and 2mm,
respectively.
Figure. 3 shows the inferences of the simulated results due to the variation of
the length of the ground planes L3, and W3, L4 and W4 are fixed at 8 mm,
5.2mm and 2mm, respectively. As the length of L3 is increased from 3.5mm to
4mm and 4.5mm, the value of fL increases from 2.31GHz to 2.35GHz and
2.36GHz, the maximum S11 value of fL increases from -15.93dB to -18.67dB
and -20.91dB, and the BW value of fL increases from 28.6% to 31.1% and
31.3%, respectively. Figure.3 also shows that as the length of L3 is increased
from 3.5mm to 4mm and 4.5mm, the value of fH and the BW value of fH are
and almost unchanged, he maximum S11 value of fH decreases from -23.35dB
to -20.49dB and -18.19dB. Using FR4 as the substrates, the variations of the
lengths of disturbed elements and ground plane would have large influences
on the characteristics of dual-band antennas. But in this study, using Al2O3
ceramic as the substrate and after finding the parameters for the design of
CPW dual-band antennas, the variations of the lengths of disturbed elements
and ground plane have no large influences on the characteristics of CPW dual-
band antennas.
The optimal parameters of L3, L4 and W4 are 4mm, 5.2mm and 2mm,
respectively. The size for the proposed dual-band monopole antenna is only 29
mm 20 mm, which is much smaller than the antenna fabricated on FR4
substrate and small enough for the applications of WLAN systems. The
