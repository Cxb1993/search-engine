and 0.1 at%, respectively. In addition, SEM observations showed that the silver electrode of ZMT 
MLCCs was greatly discontinuity by conventional sintering. Unlike two-steps sintering, this result 
shows that the silver electrode of ZMT MLCCs was completely continuity. To prove the effect of 
silver ions diffusion on the insulation resistance of ZMT MLCCs, the insulation resistance under 
different sintering conditions was measured at 85 C and 95% R.H. atmosphere. The insulation 
resistance of ZMT MLCCs with conventional sintering was degraded obviously which was compared 
with two-steps sintering. 
In this study, the effects of microwave sintering on the sintering behaviour, microstructure and silver 
diffusion of (Zn,Mg)TiO3-based multilayer ceramic capacitors (ZMT MLCCs) with pure silver 
electrodes were investigated. The energy dispersive spectroscopy results showed that the silver ions 
diffused into the dielectric layer significantly when the ZMT MLCC was sintered with conventional 
processing at 900 C. However, sintering of ZMT MLCC at 900 C using microwave processing was 
found to effectively suppress silver ion diffusion into the dielectric layer. The concentration of silver 
ions was identified by energy dispersive spectroscopy, which showed that the Ag ion concentrations 
for conventional and microwave sintering are approximately 1.7 at.% and 0.1 at.%, respectively. The 
observed difference may be due to different kinetics between conventional and microwave sintering. 
To demonstrate the effect of silver ion diffusion on the insulation resistance of ZMT MLCCs, the 
insulation resistance under different sintering modes was measured at 85 C and 95% relative 
atmospheric humidity. The insulation resistance of ZMT MLCCs with conventional sintering was 
lower than that of the microwave sintered samples.

4. 結論 
本實驗利用ZMT 陶瓷塊材與ZMT MLCC針對不同的燒結方式與不同的燒結溫度，利用EDS分析來觀察銀
擴散至介電層的濃度。其實驗結果與結論分述為以下數點: 
1. 由SEM與TEM顯微結構可以判斷，當預燒溫度越高時，銀電極本身內聚效果，而且ZMT間粉末粒子與粒子
相互連接更緊密，使其銀離子不易遷移或擴散到介電層，而使得ZMT MLCC 的銀電極連續性佳。 
2. 利用EDS分析可以發現當第一階段燒結溫度越高，銀擴散至介電層的濃度就越低。ZMT MLCC經由兩階段燒
結，銀擴散至介電層的原子百分比大約為0.2 at%，而ZMT MLCC直接燒結銀擴散至介電層原子百分比大約
為2 at%，由此可知ZMT MLCC兩階段燒結能有效的抑制銀擴散至介電層，其第一階段溫度800℃銀擴散至介
電層的濃度最低。 
3. 利用恆溫恆溼85℃/R.H.95%環境下做長時間絕緣電阻的量測，其預燒溫度越高時，絕緣電阻值也隨之上升。
這是因為預燒使銀離子不易遷移或擴散到介電層，而使得絕緣電阻值上升，提升了絕緣電阻的可靠度。

approximately 0.35 m. The powders were calcined in air at 900C for 5 h after ball milling. 
3ZnO-B2O3 (ZnBO) glass with 1 m particle size was chosen as a sintering aid and added to 
constitute 1.0 wt% of the powder. The calcined powders were then milled again for 6 h. The mean 
particle size was measured to be approximately 0.5 m.. 
2.2 Fabrication of multilayered ZMT capacitors 
In this experiment, the MLCCs consisted of ten active layers with an overall size of 2.0 x 1.25 x 0.85 
mm, with a distance of 17 μm between the internal electrodes. The ZMT powders were mixed with 
resin (polyvinyl butyral), plasticiser (butyl benzyl phthalate) and solvent (toluene and ethanol). The 
resultant slurry was tape-casted to a green sheet with 30 μm thickness using the doctor-blade method.  
A silver paste composed of silver particles, binder and solvent was prepared for screen printing. A 
silver powder (Ag C200ED, Ferro Co., USA) with average particle size of 1.1 m was used. The 
powder/organic vehicle ratio was 90/10 by weight. The pastes were prepared and homogenised on a 
standard three-roller mill. The paste consisted of 60% solid material and had a viscosity of 25 Pas by 
10 rpm. 
Ag paste was printed as an inner electrode onto the green sheet. These printed sheets were stacked, 
pressed at 60C under a pressure of 5.2x107 Pa and cut into chips. The laminated green chip was 
sintered in a microwave oven after binder burn-out (320 C). The samples were sintered in air by 
microwave processing, ramping at 15 °C/min. The temperature of the sample was monitored with a 
type-R thermocouple shielded with platinum foil and grounded to the inner metallic wall of the 
microwave furnace. The samples were sintered at various temperatures from 800 °C to 900 °C, held 
for 60 min at the peak temperature. Comparative conventional sintering was carried out in a regular 
resistance furnace at the same heating rate and holding time. 
2.3 Measurements 
The sintering shrinkage of the ZMT dielectrics and silver powders was measured at a heating rate 
of 5 C/min in air by a thermo-mechanical analyser (TMA, Netzsch DIL 402C, Germany). Both ZMT 
dielectrics and silver powders were pressed to form a disc with 10 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness. 
The capacitance and dissipation factor were measured at 1 MHz and 23 C by an impedance analyser 
(HP 4278A Palo Alto, CA). Microstructural observation of the sintered MLCC was performed with a 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Jeol. JEL-6400 Japan) equipped with energy-dispersive 
spectroscopy (EDS). In each test, two samples were analysed, and 6 points were analysed on each 
sample for a total of 12 points to ensure EDS reliability and reduce errors. The insulation resistance 
was measured with a high resistance meter (HP 4140A Palo Alto, CA) at a dc voltage of 50 V for 1 
min.  
 
3.  Results and Discussion 
3.1 Effect of microwave sintering on the density and microstructure of ZMT dielectric  
Figure 1 shows the bulk density of the ZMT ceramic pellets from each sintering process as a 
function of the sintering temperature. The density of ZMT ceramics sintered at different temperatures 
depends on the heating mode. For the ZMT ceramics sintered by the conventional process, the density 
is much lower than those sintered by microwave processing at temperatures < 880C. The theoretical 
density of the ZMT ceramic is 4.95 g/cm3.14) The ZMT ceramics produced by microwave processing 
can reach over 95% of the theoretical density (4.75 g/cm3) at 840 C. For conventional processing, 
the material must be sintered at 900 C to obtain a 95% theoretical density. In other words, the 
microwave sintering can achieve a high-density ZMT ceramic at a lower heating temperature (840 
C), while in the conventional sintering, there was no significant densification below 880 °C. The 
microwave sintering temperature was 60 °C lower than the conventional sintering. The maximum 
densities achieved for microwave and conventional sintering were 4.92 g/cm3 at 900 °C and 4.90 
g/cm3 at 920 °C, respectively. This clearly indicates that microwave sintering substantially enhanced 
the densification of ZMT ceramics. The densification effect was evaluated by linear shrinkage (ΔL/L0) 
conduction from the ZMT dielectrics. Therefore, the ZMT dielectrics will be sintered earlier than Ag 
electrodes. As a result, Ag diffusion into the ZMT dielectric layer becomes more difficult due to high 
densification of the ZMT dielectric layer. This outcome can be confirmed by examination of a 
cross-section of the ZMT MLCC. Figure 7 shows the microstructure of a ZMT MLCC sintered at 900 
C for 1 h under both sintering processes. It can be seen that the Ag electrodes remain completely 
continuous for microwave sintering as shown in Fig. 7 (a). However, Fig. 7 (b) shows the 
microstructure of the ZMT MLCC that underwent conventional sintering, in which it can be seen that 
the Ag electrodes are discontinuous. The discontinuity of the Ag electrodes may be caused by the 
diffusion of some Ag ions into the dielectric layer, which agrees with the results in Fig. 5. This result 
indicates that microwave sintering can effectively prevent the Ag ions from diffusing from the inner 
electrodes into the dielectric layer. To verify this assertion and understand the prohibition of Ag ion 
diffusion into the dielectric layer via microwave sintering, the specimen was further analysed using 
TEM. 
TEM analysis was used to investigate the effect of microwave sintering on the Ag ion diffusion. 
Figure 8 shows the TEM microstructure and EDX analysis, illustrating the ZMT MLCC sintered at 
900 C via microwave sintering. Fig. 8 (a) shows a TEM micrograph of the interface between the 
electrode and dielectric layer of the ZMT MLCC. The interface between the Ag and the ZMT phases 
is clear, implying that no interaction occurred at the interface. To understand the extent to which Ag 
ions diffused into the dielectric ceramics at the grain boundary, the compositions of the Ag particle 
and matrix phases are confirmed using EDX analysis as shown in Fig. 8 (b) and (c). The EDX 
analysis for the grain boundary "A" of the ZMT dielectric shows that no Ag ions diffuse into the 
dielectric layer at the grain boundary as shown in Fig. 8 (b). This result indicates that microwave 
sintering can effectively prevent the diffusion of Ag ions from the inner electrodes into the dielectric 
layer. 
To prove that Ag ion diffusion into the dielectric layer results in the degradation of the 
insulation resistance (IR) of ZMT MLCCs, they are placed in a constant temperature and humidity 
environment (85 C and R.H. 95%) for a long-term IR measurement as shown in Fig. 9. The result 
indicates that microwave sintering produces a higher IR value. According to a previous study,19) high 
Ag ion concentration in the dielectric layer is a known result of conventional sintering. The Ag ions 
in the dielectric layer of the MLCC can reduce the IR, especially under high temperature and high 
humidity conditions, which accelerate the decrease of the IR. Therefore, the IR of ZMT MLCCs with 
microwave sintering is higher than that of ZMT MLCC with conventional sintering. This outcome 
could be explained by the diffusion of Ag ions into the dielectric layer during cofiring because Ag 
migration leads to the local intensification of an applied field, which lowers the insulation 
resistance.26) 
Table I shows the electrical properties of ZMT MLCCs with different sintering modes. The 
microwave sintering temperatures seem to have an effect on the dielectric properties of ZMT MLCCs 
because the permittivity (r) increases with increasing sinter temperature. In particular, the r value of 
ZMT MLCCs sintered at 920 C is higher than the value for those samples sintered at 900 C. This 
result is attributed to the increase in the amount of the rutile phase,11) as observed in the SEM analysis 
(Fig. 4). As is well known,10) the existence of a small amount of the rutile phase can increase the 
dielectric constant of the ceramic because the dielectric constant of rutile, r =105, is much higher 
than that of the hexagonal ZnTiO3 phase, r =19. However, some high dielectric loss is observed for 
MLCCs sintered at 920 C compared to samples sintered at 900 C. The breakdown voltage of the 
ZMT MLCCs is highest for microwave sintering at 900 C. In addition, the lowest breakdown voltage 
(39.7 V/m) is obtained for conventional sintering. This can be explained by Ag diffusion into the 
dielectric layer during cofiring because Ag migration leads to a local intensification of an applied 
field, lowering the breakdown strength. This result can also be confirmed by EDS analysis as shown 
in Fig. 5 because the concentration of Ag ions for conventional sintering of the ZMT dielectric is 
higher than that for microwave sintering. In addition, the microwave sintering has been shown to

Abstract
Mg doped zinc titanate (ZnTiO3) films were prepared using RF magnetron sputtering.
Subsequent annealing of the as-deposited films were performed at temperatures ranging
from 600 to 900 °C. It was found that the as-deposited films was amorphous and contained
2.77 at.% Mg. This was further confirmed by the onset of crystallization that took place at
annealing temperatures 600 °C. The results showed that signle Zn2Ti3O8, phase was existed
at 600 °C. When annealing is at 700 °C, the results revealed that mainly hexagonal ZnTiO3
phase accompanying Zn2Ti3O8 minor phases were observed. When annealing is at 900 °C,
the results showed that signle hexagonal ZnTiO3 phase stably was existed. Unlike pure zinc
titanates films, this result shows that the ZnTiO3 phase can be stable at 900 °C. It means
there is no decomposition from hexagonal ZnTiO3 to cubic Zn2TiO4 and rutile TiO2 took
place with a further increase in temperature to 900 °C. This result indicates that Mg
dopants in zinc titanates thin film leads to ZnTiO3 phase existence at higher temperatures.
Moreover, the twins are observed for Mg doped zinc titanates thin films annealed at 800 °C.
It could be explained that the Zn2+ ions are substituted by Mg2+ ions into ilmenite ABO3
structure, it will create lattice strain due to ion size effect.

Introduction
It has been uging the versatility of electronic components with the high reliability and
therefore multifunctional development of high-frequency electronic materials become
imperative. Zinc titanate (ZnTiO3) have been reported to have superior electrical
properties that are adequate for applications of microwave dielectrics [1]. Three
compounds exist in the ZnO-TiO2 system: ZnTiO3 with hexagonal ilmenite structure,
Zn2TiO4 with cubic spinel crystal structure, Zn2Ti3O8 with cubic defect spinel
structure [2]. Zn2Ti3O8 has been observed to be a low-temperature from of ZnTiO3
that exists at T < 820 oC [3]. The compound Zn2Ti3O8 is formed only based on the
Figure 1 displays the x-ray diffraction patterns of Mg doped zinc titanates thin films.
There is no diffraction peaks in the x-ray pattern for the film as-deposited Fig. 1(a),
this result suggests that the film structure is amorphous. When the annealing treatment
was applied at 600 oC, peaks of Zn2Ti3O8 phase and ZnTiO3 began to appear in the
diffraction pattern, which indicates that crystalline phase has been occurred (Fig. 1(b)).
As the annealing temperature was increased to 700 oC, the mainly hexagonal ZnTiO3
phase accompanying Zn2Ti3O8 minor phases were observed as shown in Fig. 1(c).
When the annealing temperature was further increased to 900 oC, the single hexagonal
ZnTiO3 phase was existed as shown in Fig 1 (e). This result is unlike to pure zinc
titanates thin films which the hexagonal ZnTiO3 phase decomposes to the cubic
Zn2TiO4 and TiO2 phases at 900 oC as shown in Fig. 2. The SEM micrographs of Mg
doped zinc titanates thin films with varying annealing temperatures are shown in Fig.
3. The grain size increased with rising annealing temperature. The grain sizes of
specimens are 245 nm and 455 nm for 800 C and 900 C annealing, respectively.
According to XRD analysis (Fig. 1), the phases of the thin film also differ with
annealing temperature.
Figure 1: The x-ray diffraction patterns of
Mg doped zinc titanates thin films with
different annealing temperatures.
Figure 2: The x-ray diffraction patterns of
pure zinc titanates thin films with different
annealing temperatures.
TEM micrographs of the zinc titanates thin films with Mg dopant are shown in Fig. 4,
which the films are deposited on 400 oC substrate and annealed at 800 oC. The dark
grains 1 and 2 in Fig. 4 (a) are the ZnTiO3 phase according to the crystal plan and d
spacing in Fig. 4 (b) and (c). However, it is interesting that the twin is observed as
shown in Fig. 4 (a), this is a two-dimensional defect.
that it forms a mirror image of the undeformed lattice next to it. Based on above results, it
could be explained that the Zn atoms are substituted by Mg atoms into ABO3 structure. These
may be attributed to the ionic radius of Mg2+ (0.72 Å), which is smaller than that of Zn2+ (0.88
Å). When Mg substitutes into Zn sites in perovskite ABO3 structure, it will create lattice
strain. Table 2 lists the variation of the lattice constant “a” and “c” as a function of
annealing temperatures. With increasing annealing temperature, the lattice parameter a is
decreased significantly. When Mg2+ substitutes into Zn2+ sites in an ilmenite ABO3 structure,
it will decrease the lattice constant.

Conclusions
The effects of Mg dopant on the zinc titanates thin films were investigated by a
variety of analytical tools. The microstructure and phase transformation of zinc
titanates thin films can be influenced by doping Mg. It is found that the as-deposited
films were amorphous, as confirmed by the XRD results. However, the results showed
that Zn2Ti3O8 can exist at 600C annealing. When annealing is at 700C, the results
revealed that majority hexagonal ZnTiO3 phase accompanying Zn2Ti3O8 minor phases
were observed. However, it was found that the hexagonal ZnTiO3 phase can be
existed stable with a further increase in temperature to 900 C. Moreover, the twins
are observed for Mg doped zinc titanates thin films, it is due to Zn2+ ions are
substituted by Mg2+ ions into ABO3 structure.

本研究以 ZMT 積層陶瓷電容在微波燒結下，探討 ZMT 陶瓷與銀內電極的微結構
變化、銀離子擴散至介電層濃度與介電性質的影響。由 EDS 實驗結果得知，ZMT 
MLCC 在傳統燒結 900 C 下，其銀離子擴散至介電層的濃度非常高，約 2 at.%，
而使用微波燒結的 ZMT MLCC 卻是有效的抑制銀擴散至介電層，其銀離子擴散至
介電層濃度小於 0.1 at.%。本研究亦比較不同燒結條件下 MLCC 試片的絕緣電
阻變化，而絕緣電阻量測是將試片經過高溫高溼長時間(85 C/R.H.95%/720h)
處理下之絕緣電阻的變化。實驗發現絕緣電阻值會隨著存放時間的增加而下
降。不過在微波燒結的試片，其絕緣電阻值劣化程度較少。本計畫成功使用微
波燒結抑制 ZMT MLCCAg 離子的擴散,使之無法擴散之介電層,造成 MLCC 之損害.
