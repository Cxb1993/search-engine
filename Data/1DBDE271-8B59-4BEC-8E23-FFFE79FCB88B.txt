Abstract 
Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific binding 
sites (TFBSs) in gene promoters. TFBS motifs may contain one or more variable 
positions. Although the prevailing assumption is that nucleotide variants at such 
positions are functionally equivalent, there is increasing evidence that such variants 
play a role in regulation of gene expression. We proposed a method for studying the 
relationship between the expression of target genes and nucleotide variants in TFBS 
motifs at a genome-wide scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially the 
combinatorial effects of variants at two positions. Our analysis shows that nucleotide 
variations in more than one-third of variable positions and in 20% of dependent 
position pairs are highly correlated to gene expression. Furthermore, we also 
performed a genome-wide analysis of associations between variable positions and 
co-occurring TFs (co-TFs). We find that approximately 14% of the variable positions 
require the presence of co-occurring TFs. These associations occur in close proximity 
on the same promoters (i.e., highly co-localized). Moreover, such associations are 
highly conserved between sensu stricto yeasts, also influence gene expression, and are 
consistent with enriched functional categories.  
To further examine the difference in co-regulation of TFBSs in divergently 
transcribed genes, we analyzed if genes in a divergent pair share the same regulatory 
system using TF-knockout experiments. We found that most TF-knockouts only 
altered the expression of one gene in a divergent pair. To conduct a comprehensive 
analysis in silico we estimated how many divergent pairs are regulated by common 
sets of TFs (cis-regulatory modules, CRMs) using TFBSs and expression data. 
Analyses of ten expression datasets showed that only a limited number of divergent 
gene pairs share CRMs in any single dataset.  
Our analysis of impact of DNA binding nucleotide variants was published in Nucleic 
Acids Research and our work on the association between variable positions in a TFBS 
and different Co-TFs is under review process in an international journal. Further, the 
analysis of the cis-regulatory modules of divergent gene pairs in yeast has been 
published in Genomics.

A divergent (head-to-head or bidirectional) gene pair comprises of two adjacent 
genes, to which their transcription start sites are located on the opposite strands of 
DNA. A classical example is the GAL1-GAL10 gene pair in the budding yeast, in 
which the intergenic region serves as a bidirectional promoter to drive the expression 
of both genes upon galactose induction [26]. In human, the number of divergent gene 
pairs with transcription start sites separated by less than 1000 base pairs is substantial, 
constituting more than 10% of the human genome [27]. Computational analysis in 
various systems reveals that some divergent gene pairs exhibit highly correlated 
expression patterns [27-30] and, in some cases, they appear to share regulatory 
elements [31-36], suggesting that they are co-regulated by a bidirectional promoter. 
Thus, it appears that there is a high probability for an intergenic region in a divergent 
gene pair to serve as a functional bidirectional promoter, not merely two overlapping 
independent promoters. 
If the intergenic region indeed harbors a bidirectional promoter with functional 
consequence, one would expect that such a promoter is more conserved under 
selection pressure and that the divergent gene pairs are more likely to co-express than 
other types of adjacent gene pairs [37]. However, the proportions of adjacent genes 
sharing the similar expression patterns do not differ significantly, regardless whether 
they are divergent, convergent, or tandem [31, 38, 39]. Furthermore, our previous 
work in analyzing five yeast species [40] demonstrated that the probability of 
conservation of each of the three adjacent patterns is low and exhibits no statistical 
difference, seemingly arguing against the idea that a bidirectional promoter needs to 
be more conserved in evolution. This finding prompted us to conduct a more 
comprehensive analysis to estimate the number of divergent gene pairs that share 
bidirectional promoters in the budding yeast. 
In the present work, we integrated the annotations of TFBSs and microarray 
expression data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the relationship between 
variable positions and gene expression. For this purpose, we examined each variable 
position to assess its functionality. A variable position in a TFBS motif was 
considered functional if the expression patterns of target genes with different 
nucleotides in that position were significantly different [11]. We extended this strategy 
to determine whether a combination of two variable positions that are jointly 
correlated with the expression of target genes (i.e., dependent position pairs). Our 
analysis indicates that nucleotide variants at more than one-third of variable positions 
are functional (i.e., highly correlated to gene expression). In addition, more than 20% 
of dependent position pairs show a significant effect on gene expression patterns. 
Furthermore, we performed a more comprehensive analysis of association between 
the variable position and co-TFs by including both low- and high-affinity TFBSs. We

nucleotide (i.e., the number of target genes containing that nucleotide in the position). 
Though it is customary to use information content (IC) cutoff to decide whether a 
position is variable, in our work, for calculation purposes a position was defined as 
variable if at least two nucleotides were each found more than five times in the total 
number of occurrences. This is a limitation imposed by the KS test statistic in our 
method (see the following paragraph). The 71 TFs in our refined dataset contained 
632 positions. As binding motifs of 47 TFs lacked variable positions, we omitted them 
from our analysis. The remaining 24 TFs (with 213 positions) contained 75 variable 
positions (Table 1).   
Identifying functional variable positions in TFBSs 
For TF α, we grouped its target genes according to their nucleotides at a variable 
position p in its consensus. The target genes with nucleotide b (A, C, G, or T) at 
position p formed group b and the remaining genes constituted group ¬b. We used 
this grouping strategy to determine whether the nucleotide b relates to a particular 
pattern in gene expression. If the nucleotide variant at a variable position contained A, 
T, C, and G, we further assessed whether a combination of two nucleotides relates to a 
particular pattern in gene expression.

hypothesis H0: 
 
P(bi,b j , pi, p j ) = P(bi, pi) × P(b j , p j ). If H0 is rejected, there is reason 
to believe that these two variable positions are interdependent. The criterion for a 
combination of two variable positions to be dependent is that the p-value derived by 
the χ2 test must be ≤0.05. Correction for multiple testing was not applied at this stage, 
because it could reduce the number of potential position pairs for further analysis and 
because we later applied the correction when measuring the difference in gene 
co-expression. The latter procedure would effectively exclude false positives that 
might have been included in the set of dependent variable positions detected by the χ2 
test.  
Microarray data  
From the 25 expression datasets of S. cerevisiae, available in the Stanford Microarray 
Database (SMD, http://genome-www5.stanford.edu/) [44], we downloaded the 
datasets with at least seven time points; we empirically determined that a dataset 
should have at least seven time points for a reliable estimation of the Pearson 
correlation coefficients. Ten expression datasets satisfied this criterion. Each dataset 
corresponded to a particular biological function. In the glucose dataset [45], we only 
used the experiments related to galactose limitation and transcriptional response. The 
functions of the other nine datasets are as follows: glucT2 [46] relates to the physical 
responses in glucose-limited cultures; calcium [47] is an experiment that adds Ca2+ to 
yeast; mec1 [48] investigates the relationship between DNA damage responses and 
Mec1 in yeast; fkh [49] probes the role of Fkh1 and Fkh2 in the regulation of the cell 
cycle; snf [50] deals with Snf2 and Swi1 in both rich and minimal media; alpha and 
cdc15 [51] are experiments in which alpha is obtained from cells treated with 
alpha-factor transiently, and cdc15 is collected from a cdc15-2 temperature sensitive 
mutant that resumes growth after release from heat shock; sporulation [52] is related 
to yeast meiosis and spore formation; and diauxic [53] investigates the gene 
expression accompanying the diauxic shift; crz1p [47], yeast cells were triggered for 
ionic signaling by either calcium (Ca2+) or sodium (Na+); damage [48] were gathered 
from wild-type cells and mutants (defective in Mec1 signaling) treated with the 
DNA-damaging agent, MSS, or ionizing radiation over a time course.In addition, we 
used the MA lowess [54] and quantile [55] normalization methods to reduce the 
systematic biases within each microarray, as well as the intensity-dependent effects 
and biases between microarray data.  
Determining potential co-occurring TFs  
For each TF α, we also investigated whether there was another TF β that was 
associated in the same target genes more often than random expectation, and could 
therefore be a potential co-occurring TF. This is estimated by calculating whether 
N12/N is greater than the random expectation (N1/N)×(N2/N), where N1 is the total

The relationships between TFBS variable positions and co-TFs in gene 
expression 
To determine whether both nucleotide variants at a variable position p in a consensus 
α and co-TF β influence gene expression, we used the following two-way ANOVA 
model: 
ijkijjiijkY εµµµµ ++++= 0 , 
where, i represents the nucleotide (A, T, C or G) at the variable position p; j indicates 
whether TF β co-occurs with a consensus α; μ0 is the overall mean of all the target 
genes of a consensus α; μi is the main effect of the nucleotide variants at the variable 
position p; μj is the main effect of the co-TF β; μij is the effect of the interaction 
between the nucleotide variants and the co-TF β; and Yijk is the expression level of 
gene k.  
In conventional ANOVA, the total variance is partitioned into components 
related to the effects used in the model. For example, the total variance in Yijk is 
partitioned into between-group variance (σ2i, σ2j, and σ2ij corresponding to their means 
μi, μj, and μij respectively) and within-group variance (σ2, the variance of the residual 
term εijk). These can be calculated in terms of sum-of-squares, which are examined by 
F-test for significance. Next, we divided the target genes of α into groups based on the 
nucleotides at p and whether they were bound/not-bound by β. Since, for significant 
position-co-TF pairs detected by Fisher’s exact test, the number of target genes in 
12 
 
For each group, we quantified whether genes in the same group have similar 
expression profiles using the expression coherence (EC) score [18], which is defined 
as the fraction of gene pairs in the group with a correlation higher than a threshold. 
The threshold is determined as the 95th percentile correlation coefficient value of all 
the pairwise correlation coefficients between 100 randomly selected genes for a given 
expression dataset. We estimated the significance of EC scores using the method 
proposed by Lapidot and Pilpel [63]. That is, for each microarray dataset, and for each 
set size (varying from 5 to the maximal number of genes in a group), we randomly 
generated 1000 gene sets (of the same size and microarray dataset) and computed the 
EC score of each such set. The p value of a given score was estimated as the number 
of random sets with higher scores divided by 1000. For those groups with p<0.01, 
their corresponding TF compositions were considered potential CRMs in the 
condition. 
Next we determined which CRM is the most likely module to regulate G α( β) under 
the given condition. We wanted to select the CRM whose gene expression profiles are 
most similar to that of Gα. To do this, let Mi be the members in the group i, we 
examined whether the distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients between Gα and 
Mi is significantly different from that between Gα and Mbg (Mbg represent genes in the 
background set, that is, without any of the n TFBSs presenting in their promoters). We 
performed the one-sided KS test to examine the above statistical criteria. For gene Gα, 
let Eα(Μi) be the set of Pearson correlation coefficients between Gα and Mi and Eα(Μbg) 
be the set of Gα and Mbg. We tested 0 ( ) ( ): i bgE M E MH F Fα α=  against

distribution function of the correlation coefficients in a set. If H0 is rejected, 
( ) ( )i bgstE M E M
F Fα α< , which means that the correlation coefficients in Eα(Μi) are 
“stochastically greater” than that in Eα(Μbg). The group with smallest p value (<0.01) 
is considered and its corresponding CRM is assigned to regulate Gα.  
 
Results and Discussions 
Individual variable positions in TFBS motifs are functional 
To determine whether individual variable positions have a significant influence on the 
expression profile, we compiled a dataset comprising of 24 binding motifs (with 213 
positions) with 75 variable positions (Table 1). Furthermore, 28 variable positions in 
13 binding motifs met our criteria for the KS test and were identified as functional in 
at least one condition (Table 1; see also Figure 2). Eight TFs, namely FHL1, HAP1, 
14 
 
the ABF1 motif are also functional with the nucleotide “AT” in this role. We also 
found that “AT” at position 9 and “AG” at position 10 in the ABF1 motif, as well as 
“AT” at position 6 in the RAP1 motif, were functional in cell-cycle related conditions 
(alpha and cdc15). These results indicate that variable positions definitely play a role 
in gene regulation.  
Functionality of variable position pairs 
We extended our study to include dependent variable position pairs and assessed their 
functionality. For this purpose, we first used a χ2 test to determine whether the 
nucleotides distributed between two positions were dependent. We identified 163 
variable position pairs, 74 of which met the criteria discussed in Materials and 
Methods. The KS test was then applied to the 74 pairs and yielded 32 functional 
position pairs. Our results suggest that approximately 43% of dependent position pairs 
(20% of all variable position pairs) have functional meaning under different 
conditions (Tables 1 and 2).

TFBS motifs. ”Positions” shows the functional positions in our study. “b group” represents the nucleotide at a functional variable 
position considered functionally significant. The abbreviations at the top of the table correspond to different microarray 
conditions: G1 (glucose), G2 (glucT2), Ca (calcium), M (mec1), F (fkh), Sn (snf), A (alpha), Cd (cdc15), Sp (sporulation), and D 
(diauxic). In this table, the positions that satisfy our criteria (see Materials and Methods) are shown in gray.

Category two contained five position pairs that were non-functional individually, 
but formed functional position pairs in combination with one another. For example, 
MCM1, a member of the MADS box family, is known to be active in diverse cellular 
processes, such as transcriptional regulation and sequence specific DNA binding; 
hence, its binding site is well characterized [75, 76]. According to our analysis, in cell 
cycle-related experiments, MCM1 is functional at (5, 6), (5, 7) and (6, 7), and all the 
corresponding nucleotides at these position pairs are (T, T). However, individual 
positions in any of these three position pairs are non-functional.

Sp (sporulation), and D (diauxic). Subscripts 1-3 respectively denote the position pairs in Category 1 (functional individually and 
in combination), Category 2 (only functional as combinations) and Category 3 (one position was functional individually but the 
other position was not). The superscript * indicates position pairs in Category 1 that are only functional as a combination under 
specific conditions.

combinations were found to be conserved in orthologs of S. cerevisiae. Among the 
seven TFBSs with functional position pairs, two had all the predicted functional 
position pairs conserved and two exhibited conservation between orthologs at ~55% 
of the predicted position pairs. Thus, the position-pairs detected from our analysis 
appear to be under purifying selection and have not evolved neutrally.  
Association between variable positions in TFBS and co-TFs 
Although variable positions can cause differential gene expression [79], the 
transcription of genes in a cell is mostly due to multiple factors. To understand this 
complex mechanism, we analyzed the association between each variable position and 
their corresponding co-TFs (i.e., position-co-TF pairs) for all yeast TFs. In total, we 
found 127 significant position-co-TF pairs, including 74 variable positions (i.e., 
14.2% of 520 variable positions in all consensuses) in 46 consensuses. 
By using both low- and high-affinity TFBSs and all variable positions in the 
predicted TFBSs we examined the position-co-TF pairs in a genome-wide scale. As a 
result, the number of significant position-co-TF pairs is much larger in this study. In 
fact, by extending beyond the confined sets of TFBSs, we discovered many 
previously unknown position-co-TF pairs. To assess how much the associated co-TF β 
favors the preferred nucleotide at the variable position p, we calculated the PC ratio. 
The value of the PC ratio can be used to speculate the role played by a position-co-TF 
pair in regulatory mechanism. A larger PC ratio indicates that the association of the 
co-TF with a TF, which regulates the target genes, is highly dependent on the 
occurrence of the preferred nucleotide at the variable position. We then classified our 
127 significant position-co-TF pairs into three categories: the significant 
position-co-TF pairs with (I) strong dependence on the preferred nucleotide (the PC 
ratio > 0.8); (II) moderate dependence on the preferred nucleotide (0.8 ≥ the PC ratio 
> 0.5); and (III) weak dependence on the preferred nucleotide (the PC ratio ≤ 0.5). For 
example, the SKN7_a-8-Swi4 pair in category-I demonstrates that position 8 in 
SKN7_a is mostly occupied by C when Swi4 co-occurs (Figure 1.3a). In category-III, 
the position-co-TF pairs do not demonstrate distinct dependence between the co-TF 
and the variable position. However, the nucleotide frequencies at the variable 
positions of these pairs that associated with a co-TF are still significantly different 
from those with no association. Taking the ARG81-8-Reb1 pair as an example, the 
highest odds at position 8 in ARG81, along with Fisher’s exact test, suggest an 
association between this position with G and the co-TF Reb1 (Figure 1.3b). The 
numbers of position-co-TF pairs in the three categories are 52, 44 and 31, respectively. 
This finding indicates that, in most of the significant position-co-TF pairs, the 
association of the co-TF is highly dependent on the occurrence of the preferred 
nucleotide at the variable position.

-7, where F denotes the distribution function 
of the CI50 scores of TF pairs in a specific group. We repeated this analysis by also 
calculating the CI200 scores. On comparison, we found that CI50 showed more 
discriminatory bias than CI200. Thus we only considered the CI50 scores for further 
discussion of our results. This finding indicates that our significant position-co-TF 
pairs are more likely to regulate synergistically than the other potential TF pairs. 
 
The influence of significant position-co-TF pairs on gene expression 
Next, we used the two-way ANOVA test to examine the effects of significant 
position-co-TF pairs on gene expression under different biological conditions. For this 
test, we used 23 expression datasets obtained from SMD [84]. Since most of the 
significant position-co-TF pairs produce unequal cell frequencies, conventional 
ANOVA performs poorly on such unbalanced data. Here, we adopted the hierarchical 
Bayesian approach to analyze the effect of significant position-co-TF pairs [57]. A 
position-co-TF pair was deemed to be “effective” in a dataset if it showed significant 
influence on gene expression in that dataset. A total of 45 significant position-co-TF 
pairs (~36%) are effective in at least one dataset. Further, we categorized the 45 
significant position-co-TF pairs (effective pairs) into three categories according to 
their PC ratio and examined their relationship with gene expression. We found most of 
the effective pairs belonged to category-II (23 pairs) and category-III (16 pairs) while 
very few effective pairs belonged to category-I (6 pairs). These results suggest that 
effective pairs in category-II and category-III are important in different biological 
conditions.

of the enrichment score was ≤ 0.05 and at least five genes in the group of predominant 
target genes were classified into that category. A total of 51 out of 127 significant 
position-co-TF pairs are enriched in 13 functional categories (we call such 
position-co-TF pairs enriched pairs). Among the 13 categories, four are main 
categories and the remaining nine correspond to sub-categories. These categories also 
corresponded to six distinct biological processes in yeast. 
Most divergent gene pairs do not share CRMs under various conditions 
We applied the proposed method to the S. cerevisiae genome to identify the CRMs for 
genes in all divergent pairs. The identified CRMs utilizing five microarray datasets 
are summarized in Table 5. The number of identified CRMs ranges from 13 (crz1p) to 
31 (glucose). Out of 2406 genes in divergent pairs, we were able to assign CRMs for 
156~421 (7%~17%) genes in different expression conditions. Divergent pairs in 
which both genes are without assigned CRMs were excluded. For each divergent pair 
in a given condition, we used same to indicate the case in which both genes have the 
same assigned CRMs; different, two genes have different assigned CRMs; and 
one-assigned, only one gene has an assigned CRM. Both different and one-assigned 
are considered as not-shared, while same is considered as shared. Interestingly, of 
those divergent pairs assigned with CRMs, 56%~75% of them belong to the 
not-shared category. For example, in the glucose dataset, 55% and 10% of divergent 
pairs are one-assigned and different, respectively. Thus, in this case, 65% of divergent 
pairs are not-shared. Notably, in the damage condition, this number rises up to 75%. 
To gain further insights into whether a divergent pair always belongs to shared or 
not-shared category under all five conditions, we examined the variations of CRMs 
usages of all divergent pairs. The divergent pairs were grouped into the following 
three types according to their CRMs usages: (A) divergent pairs belonging to shared 
category in some conditions and to without annotation in other conditions; (B) 
divergent pairs belonging to shared in some conditions but to not-shared in other 
conditions; and (C) divergent pairs belonging to not-shared in some conditions, but 
never to shared in any condition. Note that many pairs (~52%) belong to Type C.  
 
Furthermore, for most divergent pairs in Type C, not only the assigned CRMs of 
two genes in the same pair are different, but the assigned CRMs of each individual 
gene also vary in different conditions. Therefore, it implies that in a divergent pair, the 
CRMs usages of one gene usually vary under different conditions and tend to be 
different to that of the other.

Reb1, Rpn4, RRPE, Sut1, Tye7, Ume6, Urs1 and Xbp1. Most of the TFBSs were 
found in our identified CRMs. According to the functional enrichment analysis, these 
corresponding TFs are enriched for genes annotated with “regulation of nitrogen, 
sulfur and selenium metabolism” (p=2.92×10-11). The descriptions in SGD  [62] also 
show that some of these TFs are functionally related. Interestingly, Lin et al. [34] also 
found that five motifs are over-represented in the bidirectional promoters in human. It 
remains to be investigated as to why some TFBSs are preferentially residing within 
the bidirectional promoters. 
Supporting evidences from TF knockout data 
Admittedly, it is challenging to validate the shared/not-shared proportion of divergent 
pairs experimentally. We chose to examine this issue further by using TF knockout 
data from Hu et al.’s study [40]. The underlining hypothesis is that, if a TF knockout 
affects the expression of both genes in a divergent pair, these two genes probably 
share the same CRM. On the contrary, if only one gene in a divergent pair has a 
significant expression change in a TF knockout experiment, these two genes probably 
do not share the same CRMs. We found that, a group of 414 divergent gene pairs 
exhibit no significant change of gene expression (p ≤ 0.001) upon knockout of any of 
the 263 TFs profiled by Hu et al. In the second group, which consists of 611 divergent 
gene pairs, alteration of gene expression in just one of the two genes can be observed, 
but only in a fraction of TF knockouts; the rest of TF knockouts yield no change for 
either gene. In the third group, consisting of 13 divergent gene pairs, alteration of 
gene expression, when observed, is shared by both genes, but only in some TF 
knockouts, not all. For the remaining 165 divergent gene pairs, the change of gene 
expression in a pair does not seem to follow a simple pattern, in that change can occur 
for both genes, one of the two genes, or neither. These data clearly demonstrate that 
>77% (i.e. 611/789), at the minimum, of divergent pairs do not uniformly respond to 
TF knockouts, a number even higher than that we obtained using the analysis 
described above. Taken together, these analyses support the idea that divergent genes 
pairs appear to be rarely driven by a bidirectional promoter in yeast. 
Conclusion  
In this study, we have assessed role of cis-regulatory elements (TFBSs) in gene 
expression by considering (a) the impact of nucleotide variation at variable positions 
of TFBSs on gene expression, both individually and as position pairs (b) by 
demonstrating the synergistic effects of significant position-co-TF pairs on gene 
regulation and (c) analyzing whether divergent gene pairs share bidirectional 
promoters. This is a challenging problem because of incomplete TFBS annotation and 
the noise inherent in gene expression. To address the problem, we proposed a novel 
method that infers the functionality of nucleotide variations at the variable positions

胞就像一個電腦，當你想要合成一條序列放進基因體時，就像是你要
將軟體灌到你的電腦上。最後 Dr. Hutchison 並提出在 Synthetic 
Biology 中計算生物學與生物途徑的重要性。 
第二位 Keynote 是 Dr. Hiroaki Kitano（見圖一）。Dr. Kitano 在學術
界（President of The Systems Biology Institute, Tokyo, a Principal 
Investigator at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa）
與業界（Director at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc., Tokyo）
均有傑出的成就。Dr. Kitano 以美國商業公司 23 and me 開始，說明這
是一個重要且深具影響力的產業。接著探討癌症與微環境之間的交互
作用以及免疫系統某些環節欠缺與癌症之關係。目前癌細胞與正常細
胞相比，有非常多的基因表現異常，而許多 Hub 基因在癌症都被發
現有明顯不同，但是抑制 Hub 基因會導致許多副作用。而若要設計
多目標的複合藥則需要高效率的演算法。根據這樣的概念，Dr. Kitano
提出一個平台來實現加速藥物設計，並以這幾年來藥物設計的經驗做
分享。 
值得一提的是，會場中有兩個很吸引我的單位，分別為日本的
Computational Biology Research Center（CBRC）與專攻疫苗的 EpiVax
公司。CBRC是由他們的所長 Kiyosho Asai給一個有關他們中心的介紹，
CBRC 從 2001 年起，便著手建立生物資訊相關的演算法與軟體包括了
今年底（2010）或明年初到本所做短期的訪問學者，除了要給一場演
講之外，並希望跟我的實驗室建立合作關係，探討未來合作的可能性。
希望藉由此機會有著跨領域且跨國的合作研究。 
由於 InCoB 是一個重要的生物資訊學會議，國內許多優秀學者也
一起與會，包括本所的施純傑副研究員、林仲彥助研究員以及陽明大
學楊永正副教授。許多國內的學生，包括台灣大學、陽明大學、中正
大學、交通大學以及慈濟大學的學生也都來此會發表論文或海報。我
在會議中亦認識了來自 Department of Biological sciences, East 
Tennessee State University 的 Lev Yampolsky 教授，Yampolsky 教授與
一間軟體公司合作，共同發展一套程式來計算12種果蠅的基因體中，
氨基酸替換的演化特徵，因為我做的研究偏向 non-coding 區域的分析，
Yampolsky 教授與我預計之後將結合兩個實驗室的經驗，來探討
non-coding 區域是否也存在類似的演化特徵。不過這次參加 InCoB 會
議也發現一個美中不足的地方，因為 InCoB 屬於亞太地區的會議，所
以大多數與會的研究人員以亞洲地區為主，且因正值學期中，所以許
多歐美地區的學者並未參與，一些亞洲優秀學者也沒有與會分享研究
心得。此外，這次大會也提及，希望有機會將許多亞洲區的生物資訊
會議合在一起在暑假期間舉辦，這樣可以吸引更多不同的研究人員與
會，促進學術交流。
