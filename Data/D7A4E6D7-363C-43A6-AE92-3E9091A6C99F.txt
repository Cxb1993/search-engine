Fig. 2 shows the proposed detection 
system. It takes the N data as the input, 
followed by the SA parameter detection 
system to detect a set of parameter vectors 
of K patterns. After convergence, patterns 
are recovered from the detected parameter 
vectors.  
SA parameter detection system consists 
of two main parts: 1. definition of system 
error (energy, distance); 2. SA algorithm for 
determination of the parameter vectors with 
minimum error. 
We use a general equation based on the 
translation and rotation of the standard type 
of ellipse and hyperbola.

Summary 
 
A Hierarchical system is proposed by using simulated 
annealing to detect hyperbola in image. The hierarchical 
detection procedures are patterns by patterns. The equation 
of hyperbola is defined under translation and rotation. The 
distance from all points to all patterns is defined as the 
error. Also we use the minimum error to determine the 
number of patterns. The proposed simulated annealing 
parameter detection system can search a set of parameter 
vectors for the global minimal error. In the seismic 
experiments, the hierarchical system can well detect line of 
direct wave and hyperbola of reflection wave in the 
simulated one-shot seismogram and the real seismic data. 
The results of seismic pattern detection can improve 
seismic interpretation and further seismic data processing. 
 
Introduction 
 
Usually Hough transform (HT) was used to detect patterns 
in image. But it needed huge calculation and consumed the 
memory. 
 
A seismogram consists of line pattern of direct wave and 
hyperbolic pattern of reflection wave. In 1985, Huang et al. 
had applied HT to detect line pattern of direct wave and 
hyperbolic pattern of reflection wave. However, the 
determination of the parameters of the shape was not easy 
and memory requirement was also a problem. 
 
In 2002, Jayanta et al. proposed Hough transform neural 
network (HTNN) to detect lines, circles, and ellipses, but it 
did not detect hyperbolas. In 2006, Huang et al. adopted 
HTNN to detect lines of direct wave and hyperbola of 
reflection wave in a one-shot seismogram. But gradient 
descent method had local minimum problem. 
 
In 1983, Kirkpatrick et al. proposed the simulated 
annealing (SA). It is a global optimization algorithm. The 
key of the algorithm to reach the global minimum is in 
conditionally accepted higher-energy states by Metropolis 
criterion. In 2007, Chen and Huang adopted the SA to 
detect the parameters of lines, ellipses, and hyperbolas. But 
it is time-consuming to detect patterns. 
 
Here, we propose a hierarchical detection system to detect 
the line pattern of direct wave and hyperbola pattern of 
reflection wave in the one-shot seismogram and real 
seismic data.  
 
Hierarchical seismic pattern detection system 
 
Hierarchical seismic pattern detection system consists of 
three main parts: 1. definition of system error (energy, 
distance); 2. SA algorithm for determination of the 
parameter vectors with minimum error; 3. removing the 
detected patterns. 
 
Parametric patterns 
We use a general equation based on the translation and 
rotation of the standard type of hyperbola.

If (a > 0, b < 0, and f ≠ 0) or (a < 0, b > 0, and f ≠ 0), the 
graph is a hyperbola. When (a > 0, b < 0, and f = 0) or (a < 
0, b > 0, and f = 0), the graph is the asymptotes of the 
hyperbola. They are two crossing lines, so we can use (1) to 
represent lines. Because the line pattern of direct wave and 
the hyperbolic pattern of reflection wave are always north-
south opening in a one-shot seismogram, so we set (a < 0 
and b > 0) to detect seismic patterns. 
 
In vector form, a parameter vector p = [mx, my, a, b, θ, f]T 
represents a pattern. For kth pattern pk = [mk,x, mk,y, ak, bk, 
θk, fk]T. And for all K patterns, the matrix P = [p1, p2, …, 
pK] represents all K patterns. We set f as nonnegative 
number. 
  
System error 
For the error or energy of the system, we first calculate the 
distance from a point to a pattern. The distance from a point 
xi = [xi, yi]T to the kth pattern is defined as

The parameter of a, b, f can not be equal to zeros at the 
same time. Also, the distance from a point to the pattern is 
affected by the scale of coefficients. So we have to 
normalize the parameter a and b by || ab  so that the new 
|ab| = 1.  
 
Then, we calculate the error from a point to K patterns that 
is the minimal distance from the point to all patterns. Error 
or distance from a point to all K patterns is defined as the 
minimal distance from the point to all patterns. The error or 
energy of the ith point xi is

Hierarchical detection system 
Figure 2 shows the flowchart of the hierarchical simulated 
annealing parameter detection system. First, we set a > 0, b 
< 0 to detect the hyperbolas. Second, input data and set 
threshold point (TP), threshold error (TE), and the run 
number (Rn), and then use simulated annealing to detect 
parameters. The threshold point (TP) is defined as that the 
number of points N divided by the number of patterns K, 
TP = N/K                                     (10) 
If the detected patterns consist of points which are greater 
than TP and the error is less than TE, we remove the 
detected pattern. The remaining data will be used in the SA 
algorithm to detect the patterns. Until the run number 
equals to the total run number Rn, the detection system is 
stopped.

Experimental results 
 
Experiments on simulated one-shot seismogram 
Figure 3 (a) shows the simulated one-shot seismogram. The 
simulated horizontal reflection layer is with the depth 500 
m and the velocity of the p-wave in the sedimentary rock is 
2,500 m/sec. There are 64 receiving stations on both side of 
explosion with 50 m between each other. The sampling 
interval is 0.004 sec. The wavelet is 25 Hz Ricker wavelet. 
Reflection coefficient is 0.2 and noise is band-passed noise, 
10.2539Hz ~ 59.5703Hz, with uniform distributed over (-
0.2, 0.2). The horizontal axis in Figure 3 is the trace 
number and the vertical axis is for time t. The one-shot 
seismogram is first preprocessed by envelope processing, 
thresholding with the threshold 0.15, and peak detection 
and shown in Figure 4 (a). The image size is 512 × 65. The 
points are then used as the input to the hierarchical 
detection system. 
 
In the hierarchical parameter detection system, the initial 
parameter set mk,x = 33, mk,y = 0, ak = -1, bk = 1, and fk = 1. 
The TP set 64, TE set 30, and Rn set 2. The cooling 
function is as (5) with a temperature, Tmax = 60, and Tα = 
0.9. There are Nt = 25 trials in a temperature. The 
temperature decreases 200 times. Constants αm = 2, αab = 2, 
and αf = 4. The detection result of Figure 4 (a) is shown in 
Figure 4 (d).

Experiments on real one-shot seismogram 
The hierarchical system is applied to detect direct wave and 
reflection wave in real seismic data. We obtain seismic data 
from Seismic Unix System. The real data in Figure 3 (b) is 
at Canadian Artic, which has 48 traces and 3,100 samples 
per trace with sampling interval 0.002 seconds. 
 
After preprocessing, we only choose points with t < 1.4 
seconds, which include points from direct wave, first layer 
reflection wave, and second layer reflection wave as in 
Figure 5 (a), where there are 88 points.  
 
Using the hierarchical detection system and setting of the 
initial parameter mk,x is random between 0 and 50, mk,y is 
random between 0 and 3100 , ak = -1, bk = 1, fk = 1, αm = 8, 
αab = 2, αf = 4, Tα= 0.9, Tmax = 60, Nt = 25, TP = 30, TE = 
30, and cooling cycle 200 times, the detection result is 
shown in Figure 5 (b).
