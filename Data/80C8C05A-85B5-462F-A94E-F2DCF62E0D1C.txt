二、研究方法 
The schematic layout and its cross section along the A-A’ line of the fabricated La2O3 MIM 
capacitors are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. The main fabrication steps were 
summarized below. After performing the standard RCA clean process to remove the native oxide 
and any contamination, the 1-µm thermal oxide was grown on 6-inch Si wafer as an isolation 
buffer layer by using wet oxidation. And then, the 200-nm tantalum (Ta) layer and the 50-nm 
tantalum nitride (TaN) layer were subsequently deposited on buffer oxide layer as the bottom 
electrode by a reactive sputtering system. Ta layer and TaN layer were used to reduce the 
parasitic resistance and to serve as a diffusion barrier layer, respectively. Before defining the 
bottom electrode of the MIM capacitor, the surface of TaN was treated by ammonia (NH3) plasma 
nitridation at 300 mtorr with the RF power of 100 watts for 10 minutes to reduce the interfacial 
layer during the following high-k annealing processes. Besides, the metal layer TaN with NH3 
treatment has more flat surface roughness so that the leakage current of the MIM capacitor could 
be reduced under bottom injection condition.   
The bottom electrode TaN/Ta was lithographically patterned and defined by employing a 
transformer-coupled-plasma (TCP) etcher with chlorine-based gas. Subsequently, the 200-nm 
tetraethoxylsilane (TEOS) oxide film used as the first inter-layer dielectric (ILD) isolation was 
deposited by utilizing a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system at 300 °C. 
The capacitor region and the bottom contact region were etched by buffered oxide etchant (BOE) 
solution after being opened by optical lithography process. Afterwards, the lanthanum oxide 
(La2O3) was deposited by using electron beam evaporation. The high-k dielectric La2O3 film on 
bottom electrode was annealed at 400 °C in O2 ambient to improve its quality via fully oxidation 
and defects elimination. After lithography process to define the top electrode region, the 60-nm 
nickel (Ni) and the 30-nm TaN were subsequently deposited by electron beam evaporation and 
reactively sputtering, respectively. And then, the top electrode with Ni/TaN bi-layer metal was 
formed by using lift-off technique.  
Next, the 300-nm TEOS oxide film served as the second ILD passivation layer was 
deposited by using a PECVD system at 300 °C. Because the La2O3 high-k dielectric film and the 
TaN metal were hardly etched by BOE solution, the contact holes were patterned by two-step

三、結果與討論 
Figure 2 shows the C-V and J-V characteristics of the 10-nm La2O3 MIM capacitor. The 
capacitance density at zero bias is about 11.4 fF/µm2, and the leakage current densities at −1.5 
and +1.5 V are 16 and 56 nA/cm2, respectively. The quadratic voltage coefficient of capacitance 
(α), used to depict the voltage dispersion or voltage dependency of capacitance, is obtained from 
fitting the C-V curves by the second-order polynomial equation: 
( ) ( )20 1= × × + × +C V C V Vα β , (1) 
where C0 is the capacitance at zero bias. The α values of the 10-nm La2O3 MIM capacitor 
measured at 10 and 100 kHz are 775 and 671 ppm/V2, respectively. The positive α represents a 
capacitance density rise with the increase in applied voltage, which may be attributed to the high 
degree of electric field polarization and carrier injection. During the voltage sweeping, some of 
the injected carriers would be captured by the interface trap states existing in the dielectric near 
the injection electrode. These trapped charges could induce dipoles following the alternating 
signals with a dipole relaxation time. Moreover, the other injection carriers become excess mobile 
charges in the insulator, and these mobile charges also follow the small ac signals with a free 
carrier relaxation time that depends on the mobility and density of carriers. The dipole and free 
carrier relaxation time contribute to various frequency-dependent characteristics in RF/analog 
MIM capacitors. As the measurement frequency increases, the trapped-charge-induced dipoles 
and the excess mobile charges hardly follow the ac signal, corresponding to the longer relaxation 
times of these dipoles and mobile charges. Thus, the capacitance fluctuation due to the varied 
applied voltages becomes smaller and results in the lower α with increasing frequency. While 
both dipole polarization and free carrier polarization could modulate the capacitance, the free 
carrier effect is believed to play the major role in the voltage dependence of capacitance, but is 
negligible for the zero-biased capacitance where the carrier injection ceases. 
To further investigate the stability of the La2O3 MIM capacitor under electrical stress, the 
CVS test was carried out. Figure 3 shows the relative capacitance variation [ΔC/C(t=0)] as a 
function of stress time at various CVS voltages from −4.6 to −5 V. The relative capacitance 
variation is defined as 
( )
( ) ( )
( )0 00
0
0 0
− =Δ == =
C t C tC
C t C t
, (2) 
where C0(t=0) is the initial capacitance at zero bias before stress, and t is the stress time. 
[ΔC/C(t=0)] increases with the CVS voltage and the stress time. On the other hand, [ΔC/C(t=0)] 
is also plotted as a function of the injected charge (Qinj) in the inset of Fig. 3. The relative 
capacitance variation increases with a logarithmic increase in Qinj regardless of the stress biases, 
which implies that the increasing charge trapping in dielectrics during CVS is responsible for the 
capacitance variation. The trapped charges in the preexisting traps and in stress-induced traps 
generate dipoles to increase the local permittivity and the capacitance. Among them, the 
stress-induced dipoles contribute to the relative increase in capacitance with respect to its initial 
6 
 
the same slope independent of the stress voltage. This linear relationship further verifies the 
relationship between the amount of trap generation, responsible for the dielectric loss, and the 
reduction of free carrier mobility, responsible for the voltage dependence of capacitance. In other 
words, stress-induced trap states reduce the free carrier mobility in the dielectric and therefore 
increase the free carrier relaxation time that decreases the α of MIM capacitors under CVS. 
Additionally, the time dependence of [α(t)/α(t=0)] at various measurement frequencies under a 
CVS of −4.8 V is shown in Fig. 6, and the inset presents the dependence of [α(t)/α(t=0)] on the 
relative variation in dielectric loss [ΔD/D(t=0)]. As the measurement frequency increases, the 
changes in [α(t)/α(t=0)] become smaller. This is believed to be due to the smaller α(t=0) at 
higher frequency. From the inset of Fig. 6, [α(t)/α(t=0)] linearly decreases with a logarithmic 
increase in relative dielectric loss, and the slope is again independent of the measurement 
frequencies, and the same as that obtained in Fig. 5. As a result, one can derive that changes in κ 
must vary linearly with changes in D as well.  
Figure 7 exhibits the cumulative results of The time-zero dielectric breakdown (TZDB) for 
the 10-nm La2O3 MIM capacitors at the measurement temperature varied from 25 to 125°C in the 
case of top injection, the breakdown field (EBD) of 50% failure probability declines from 7.35 to 
5.66 MV/cm as the temperature rises from 25 to 125°C. Besides, from the Fig. 7, it can be noted 
that as the measurement temperature raises, the distribution of the EBD data becomes narrower. 
This temperature dependence of TZDB is related to the damage created in the oxide during the 
measurement. When carrying out the measurement, a rapid increase in applied voltage results in a 
rapid rise in local current density of the dielectric to generate energetic carriers that could release 
the energy and distort or weaken the local molecular bonds of the dielectric film. The weakened 
molecular bonds become very susceptible to be broken by the further injection carriers, and then 
a localized defective (percolation) site forms. As a conductive percolation path develops shorting 
the two electrodes, the breakdown occurs. For the high temperature measurement, more energetic 
injection carriers are available to create damage leading to lower breakdown voltage than that of 
low temperature measurement. The effective defect forming process at elevated temperature not 
only reduces the EBD magnitude, but also causes the dielectrics of different MIM capacitors break 
down at almost the same applied voltage.

1. Introduction 
Recently, high-k metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors 
integrated into backend interconnection as passive components 
have generated great interest for analog and RF applications 
[1], [2]. The stability of MIM capacitors is a key issue on 
precision performance, especially on the voltage linearity. 
Some studies [3], [4] have discussed the capacitance variation 
of SiO2 MIM capacitors during electrical stress. However, the 
degradation of the MIM capacitor with high-k dielectric has 
not been well characterized. In this paper, the behaviors of 
La2O3 MIM capacitors under constant voltage stress (CVS) 
were investigated. The correlations among the injected charges 
(Qinj), the capacitance change (ΔC/C0), the quadratic voltage 
coefficient of capacitance (α), and the dielectric loss (D) of the 
La2O3 MIM capacitor were also discussed. 
2. Device Fabrication and Experimental Procedures 
This work focused on a 10-nm La2O3 MIM structure with 
an 11.4-fF/µm2 capacitance density and an area of 2500 µm2. 
The schematic layout and the schematic cross section of the 
capacitor along the A-A’ line in the layout are shown in Figs. 
1(a) and 1(b). The high-k dielectric La2O3 film was deposited 
by e-beam evaporation and annealed in O2 ambient to improve 
its quality. The top bi-layer (TaN/Ni) and bottom (TaN/Ta) 
electrodes were deposited by a reactive sputtering. All process 
temperatures during MIM capacitors fabrication were below 
400 °C compatible with backend process. The samples were 
subjected to constant voltage stress in the range of −4.2 V to 
−5 V applied on the top electrode (Ni), and their capacitances 
variation were also measured at 25°C using an LCR meter at 
various intervals during CVS testing. 
3. Results and Discussion 
Fig. 2 shows C-V and J-V characteristics of the 10-nm 
La2O3 MIM capacitor. The leakage current is below 10-7 A/cm2 
under the applied voltage of ±2 V. The quadratic voltage 
coefficient (α) of capacitance could be fitted by the second 
order polynomial equation: C (V) = C0 · (α · V2 + β · V + 1), 
where C0 is the capacitance at zero bias. Hence, the values α 
of 10-nm La2O3 MIM capacitor measured at 10 kHz and 100 
kHz are 775 ppm/V2 and 671 ppm/V2, respectively.  
Fig. 3 illustrates the correlations among the relative 
capacitance variation [C0(t)-C0(0)]/C0(0), the stress time, and 
the injection charges (Qinj) at various CVS voltages from −4.6 
V to −5 V, where C0(t=0) is an initial capacitance at zero bias. 
As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the relative-capacitance 
variation increases with a logarithmic increase in Qinj 
regardless of the stress biases, which implies charge trapping 
in dielectric films [5]. When the carriers inject into the La2O3 
dielectric film during CVS stress, the trapped charges could 
generate dipoles to increase the local permittivity and then 
contribute to the degradation of the capacitance [3], [4]. 
Besides, as shown in Fig. 3, after the [C0(t)-C0(0)]/C0(0) 
rapidly increases in the initial stress, it tends to saturate after 
the 1000-s stressing. This saturation could be attributed to the 
trapped charges near the top electrodes. After the pre-existing 
trap states are rapidly filled by injection charges to increase 
the capacitance, the trapped charges would increase the barrier 
height near the injection electrode and result in a saturation 
phenomenon [6].  
Fig. 4 depicts the 10-year stability extraction of a 
fabricated 10-nm La2O3 MIM capacitor estimated by the 
relative-capacitance variation. It could be obtained from the 
extrapolated [C0(t)-C0(0)]/C0(0) versus stress time to 10 years, 
as shown in the inset in Fig. 4. The 10-year degradations of 
10-nm La2O3 MIM capacitors with an 11.4-fF/µm2 capacitance 
are 6.32 %, 4.09 %, and 2.61 % under −4.6 V, −4.4 V, and −4.2 
V, respectively. The safety 10-year operation voltage with 
below 1-% degradation could be extrapolated by around −4 V. 
This long-term stability is useful for the sub-65 nm technology 
node, whose operating voltage is smaller than 1.5 V.  
Time dependence of α(t) normalized to its initial value 
α(0) under CVS biases from −4.6 V to −5 V is plotted in Fig. 5. 
The inset presents the dependence of α(t)/α(0) on the relative 
variation in dielectric loss [D0(t)-D0(0)]/D0(0) during stressing, 
where D0(0) is the fresh dielectric loss at zero bias. It can be 
found that α(t)/α(0) decreases with the increasing stress time 
for a certain stress bias. The reason for the decrease in the 
voltage dependence of capacitance is that the carrier mobility 
is reduced by the stress-induced trap states, and then hardly 
follows the alternating signal with a higher relaxation time [7]. 
Besides, α(t)/α(0) linearly decreases with a logarithmic 
increase in relative dielectric loss, but it still maintains almost 
the same slope under various stress voltages. It further verifies 
the change in voltage dispersion of capacitance is ascribed to 
the stress induced traps. 
Dependence of α(t)/α(0) on stress time under a CVS of 
−4.8V with various measurement frequencies is exhibited in 
Fig. 6, and the inset presents the dependence of α(t)/α(0) on 
the relative variation in dielectric loss [D0(t)-D0(0)]/D0(0). As 
the measurement frequency increases, the changes in α(t)/α(0) 
become smaller, and the correlation between α(t)/α(0) and the 
relative variation in D has been confirmed again. 
4. Conclusions 
The stabilities of MIM capacitors with La2O3 dielectric 
under CVS are investigated in this paper. It could be found 
that the degradation in capacitance is dependent on injected 
charges (Qinj). The correlation between the carrier injection 
and the relative-capacitance variation of La2O3 MIM 
capacitors is also evaluated. The improvement in voltage 
nonlinearity of La2O3 MIM capacitors during CVS testing 
could be attributed to the stress induced traps in dielectrics. 
Additionally, highly stability of 10-year lifetime was achieved 
for a 10-nm La2O3 MIM capacitor with an 11.4-fF/µm2 
capacitance density.
