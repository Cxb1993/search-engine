Introduction 
Recently, a great deal of research has 
been carried out on alternative planarization 
processes capable of chemical mechanical 
planarization (CMP). ECMP may seem 
more promising for planarization of Cu be-
cause of its high planarization efficiency 
and high removal rates, which can be 
achieved by mechanical polishing with very 
low downward-pressure (< 0.5 psi) [1-5]. 
However, most recent ECMP studies con-
tinue to use tailored CMP slurries [6-10]. 
These ECMP electrolytes also continue to 
include oxidizers, which affect waste treat-
ment. 
Recently, Tripathi et al. [11] have de-
veloped an oxidizer-free ECMP electrolyte 
using hydroxyethylidenediphoric acid 
(HEDP), 5-phenyl-1- H-tetrazole, and oxalic 
acid as a base electrolyte, an inhibitor, and a 
complexing agent, respectively. However, 
the planarization performance was only 
demonstrated with the use of abrasive par-
ticles and high downward-pressure (~1.5 
psi). Previously, we proposed that a phos-
phate-based electrolyte containing benzo-
triazole (BTAH) could be used for a Cu 
ECMP process with no oxidizing agent 
present [4]. The reason for the addition of 
BTA was to enhance the planarization effi-
ciency due to the formation of a BTAH pas-
sive film on the Cu surface [12-13]. Accele-
rated Cu removal is obtained from the sur-
face elevations because the original passive 
film is abraded away, coupled with little or 
no removal at surface recesses, where the 
passive film remains intact. We also demon-
strated that the BTAH passive film was sta-
ble only at lower operating potentials (< 0.7 
V vs. Ag/AgCl), resulting in the phosphate 
ECMP electrolyte with a narrow operating 
potential window [4]. Stewart and Gewirth 
[14] have claimed that the addition of chlo-
ride ion (Cl-) in low concentration into 
acidic solutions in the presence of BTAH 
can increase the thickness of BTAH passive 
film because Cl- can be incorporated into 
BTAH passive film and coordinate the Cu+ 
center in the BTAH passive film. The 
Cl--containing BTAH passive film becomes 
thicker, thus resulting in the enhancement of 
BTAH inhibition against Cu dissolution. 
However, they only studied the influence of 
Cl- on the thickness of BTAH passive film 
in a hydrochloric acid solution at 
open-circuit potential.  
This study involves a systematic ex-
ploration of the idea using the synergy of 
BTAH and Cl- for further controlling Cu 
dissolution and attempting to expand the 
operating potential window in the phosphate 
ECMP electrolyte. The electrochemical 
measurements, such as microfluidic mea-
surement, polarization test, electrochemical, 
and quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), , 
were made to evaluate and characterize the 
inhibition efficiency of BTAH passive film 
formed in the phosphate electrolyte with and 
without Cl- at various potentials. In addition, 
the nature of the BTAH passive film with 
and without Cl- was also further investigated 
by using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
technique and a secondary ion mass spec-
trometer (SIMS). Eventually, a patterned Cu 
foil has been characterized in the phosphate 
electrolyte in the presence of Cl- at a high 
operating potential of 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl us-
ing an ECMP polishing apparatus, and re-
sults are shown.   
 
Experimental  
The base electrolyte was composed of 
de-ionized water and 1 M potassium phos-
phate (monobasic, Sigma Aldrich). The pH 
of the base electrolyte was adjusted to 2 us-
ing small amounts of pure ortho-phosphoric 
4 
 
profiler (Dektak 150, VEECO). The width 
and depth of the features were measured at 
about 200μm and 2.5μm before ECMP 
process. It should be noted that the edge ef-
fect in the patterned structure does not 
attribute to the ECMP process [17].    
 
Results and Discussion 
The results of potentiodynamic polari-
zation measurements using the RDE adapter 
to evaluate the inhibition efficiency of 
BTAH are shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, the ad-
dition of 0.01 M BTAH into the phosphoric 
acid shows no inhibition effect on Cu dis-
solution, indicated by a lack of decrease in 
current density in the polarization curve. 
However, the inhibition effect can be ob-
served in the phosphate electrolyte with as 
little as 0.001 M BTAH. This result is con-
sistent with what we have previously ob-
served on a Cu RDE [4].

curves with a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 in solu-
tion: (a) phosphoric acid and (b) phos-
phate-based electrolyte in the presence of 
BTA ranging from 0 M to 0.01 M. 
 
 
For a more detailed study of the ad-
sorption and desorption behaviors of the 
BTAH passive layer in the phosphate elec-
trolyte, chronoamperometric measurements 
were performed using the aforementioned 
microfluidic device. Figure 3 demonstrates 
the current response upon transitioning from 
the phosphate electrolytes to 
BTAH-containing electrolytes. Results are 
shown at applied potentials from 0.5 to 1.0 
V vs. Ag/AgCl. Initially, the phosphate so-
lution was pumped through the working 
channel for 30 s, following which, the solu-
tion was switched to one containing BTAH. 
The addition of BTAH eventually caused an 
abrupt decrease in the current for the poten-
tiostatic experiment, indicating the start of 
the inhibition effect. In general, lower 
BTAH concentrations, resulted in longer 
delay prior to the inhibition, indicating a 
variation of adsorption time. For instance, 
the adsorption time constant increased from 
around 6 s at the highest concentration to 
about 48 s with only 0.001 M BTAH at 0.5 
V vs. Ag/AgCl. Moreover, for potential 
above 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the current ac-
tually slightly increased after the initial ab-
rupt current lowering, probably implying 
insufficient protection of the passive layer 
upon high anodic polarization.

(b) 0.002 M (c) 0.005 M (d) 0.01 M BTAH 
at 30 s. Results are shown as a function of 
applied potential vs. Ag/AgCl. 
 
Potentiostatic time constants observed 
in Fig. 4 are summarized in Fig. 4, in which 
the time constant was extracted from the 
6 
 
phate electrolyte containing 0.01 M BTAH 
alone, the much poorer passivation was ob-
served at anodic potentials, with BTAH 
passive film breakdown at ~0.43 V vs. 
Ag/AgCl. Muthukumaran et al. [21] also 
have utilized EQCM to investigate the 
BTAH passivation capability and proposed 
that the BTAH passive film formed in a 
BTA-containing solution tended to break 
down at higher overpotentials, thereby ex-
posing the underlying Cu and resulting in 
dissolution.  
 
Figure 6. EQCM studies of mass change in 
phosphate electrolytes containing (a) 0.01 M 
BTA; (b) 0.01 M BTA + 500 ppm Cl-. The 
sweep potential was performed from 0 V to 
1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1.  
 
To understand the origin of the en-
hancement of BTAH passivation when in-
troducing Cl- into the BTAH-containing 
phosphate electrolytes, AFM technique was 
first performed to investigate the thickness 
of the BTAH passive film. Figures 4a and 
4b show the AFM 3D images of electropo-
lished Cu foils obtained from the phosphate 
electrolytes containing 0.01 M BTAH 
without and with 500 ppm Cl-, respectively. 
From Fig. 7, it can be noted that the BTAH 
film in the presence of Cl- seems much 
thicker compared to only BTAH passive 
film. Gewirth et al. [14] have observed that 
the addition of Cl- into acidic solutions in 
the presence of BTAH can increase the 
thickness of BTAH passive film due to the 
incorporation of Cl- into BTAH passive film 
and the coordination with the Cu+ center in 
the BTAH passive film. As a result, the 
Cl--containing BTAH passive film becomes 
thicker and leads to the increase in BTAH 
inhibition against Cu dissolution. To further 
evaluate the thickness of BTAH passive 
film in quantification in this study, the fol-
lowing procedure was proposed. For in-
stance, the point A and the point B were se-
lected on the BTAH passive region and 
electropolished Cu substrate; then the step 
height analysis between these two points 
was performed to determine the thickness of 
BTAH passive film, as shown in Fig. 7a. 
The same procedures were performed at 
nine times for each system. The measured 
average thickness of BTAH passive film 
without and with Cl- was ~52.3 ± 7.5 nm 
and ~103.7 ± 17.8 nm, respectively. This 
implies that Cl- may be incorporated into the 
BTAH passive film, thus increasing the 
thickness of BTAH passive film. The thick-
ness of BTAH passive film and 
Cl--containing BTAH passive film produced 
at low anodic potential using the ex situ 
AFM analysis in this study are in accor-
dance with those previously reported.  
 
Figure 7. 5 μm × 5 μm ex situ taping mode 
3D AFM images obtained after a constant 
applied potential of 0.3 V Vs. Ag/AgCl for 
150 s in phosphate electrolytes: (a) 0.01 M 
BTA ; (b) 0.01 M BTA + 500 ppm Cl-.  
 
To further verify the observation from 
AFM studies, SIMS analysis was carried out. 
Figures 5a to 5b show the secondary ion 
counts obtained at mass 12 corresponding to 
8 
 
both quite protective at surface recesses at 
low anodic potentials, but the Cu removal 
rates were too low for use in ECMP. If a 
higher anodic potential was employed, then 
the removal rate would be adequate. The 
polarization curves with abrasion shown in 
Fig. 9 can be used to calculate the Cu re-
moval rate during ECMP, as also shown in 
Fig. 10. Nevertheless, the theoretical re-
moval rate in the presence of Cl- can still 
reach 600 nm min-1 and 1100 nm min-1 at 
0.5 V and 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. 
Moreover, the ICP results manifested that 
the measured removal rate at 0.5 V and 1.0 
V vs. Ag/AgCl was ~670 nm min-1 and 
~1050 nm min-1. In practice, the Cu removal 
rate for CMP is ~ 300 nm min-1 [23]. Tripa-
thi et al. [11] also mentioned the removal 
rate of 600 nm min-1 is at least desired for 
use in ECMP. Therefore, the removal rate 
obtained in the phosphate electrolyte con-
sisting 0.01 M BTAH and 500 ppm Cl- is 
useful for use in ECMP while the operating 
potential is over 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. By in-
spection of ECMPε  and removal rate for the 
electrolyte consisting of 0.01 M BTAH and 
500 ppm Cl-, a wide potential window 
ranging from 0.5 V to 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl 
can be obtained where not only a sufficient 
Cu removal rate (> 600 nm min-1) but also a 
good ECMPε (> 0.95) can be achieved.  
To further demonstrate planarization 
capability at high anodic potential, Cu pat-
terned structures were employed in the 
ECMP polishing apparatus. Figure 8 
presents planarization results in the phos-
phate electrolyte containing 0.01 M BTAH 
without and with 500 ppm Cl- at an operat-
ing potential of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under a 
downward force of ~0.5. The profilometric 
scans before and after polishing are supe-
rimposed onto each other and presented in 
Fig. 11. For BTAH alone (Fig. 11a), in addi-
tion to almost no step height reduction 
(SHR) was observed after the polishing, 
partial Cu dissolution still occurred at the 
bottom of the features. This indicates that 
only BTAH passive can not suffer from de-
sorption at such high operating potential, 
thus the conformal Cu removal at the top 
and bottom of the features can be obtained. 
However, as for Cl--containing BTAH pas-
sive film (Fig. 11b), an apparent SHR value 
of ~1000 nm was achieved after polishing. 
According to the ICP measurements, the 
average amount of thickness reduction 
across the Cu foil (λavg) was ~ 470 nm. The 
area used to calculate the amount of Cu film 
removed was the contact area of Cu foil 
during polishing. We have also observed 
that there is almost no detection of Cu re-
moval during operation without abrasion 
due to the existence of Cl--containing BTAH 
passive film at either 0.5 V or 1.0 V vs. 
Ag/AgCl, thus resulting in the selective 
dissolution of the extrusion areas versus the 
recessed areas of a patterned structure. It 
could be the reason to explain the difference 
between measured λavg and SHR. This result 
also indicates that the addition of Cl- into 
the BTAH-containing phosphate electrolyte 
can really enhance the BTAH passivation 
ability, even at high anodic potential and 
thus a wide potential window can be ob-
tained for use in this ECMP electrolyte.
