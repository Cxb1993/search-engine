中文摘要 
 
供應鏈管理是近十年來製造研究方面最重要且最被廣泛討論的主題之ㄧ，供
應鏈即所謂的價值鏈，是由互有關聯的供應商、製造商、配銷業者和顧客所組成
的網路，而供應鏈管理的目的在於如何有效的整合鏈中各組織的成員進而達到滿
足顧客的需求並提升整個供應鏈的競爭力。由於過去供應鏈之不同成員間的資訊
無法共享且決策制定缺乏協商，成員各自尋求自己最好的決策，而非整個供應鏈
的最好決策，導致供應鏈的運作缺乏效率，本計畫的主要構想是站在某一製造商
的立場，此製造商除考量本身之配送車輛的容量限制外、並將配送製成品至各零
售商之途程所需的運輸時間納入生產排程的考慮項目，這種整合供應鏈成員中的
製造商與零售商之資訊的情況將使得生產排程決策範圍得以擴展且更符合實務
的運作，為了與僅考慮製造商資訊的傳統生產排程有所區別，我們將這種整合供
應鏈成員中的製造商與零售商之資訊的生產排程稱為供應鏈生產排程。 
本計畫供應鏈生產排程之研究共分為兩年來執行，探討整合製造商與零售商
的二階供應鏈生產排程，其中第一年假設此製造商只有單一工廠，而第二年則假
設此製造商擁有多工廠的情況。藉由本計畫的進行，我們將現有的傳統排程領域
推向更具整合能力、更符合實務運作的供應鏈生產排程領域。

車輛運送至單一顧客的手中，另外，運送車輛的容量考慮有限及無限兩種情況，
而且每一運送途程皆考量運輸時間，論文中主要是分析不同模式的複雜度。
Chang and Lee (2004)更進一步擴展了 Lee and Chen (2001)的研究模式，將每一工
作佔用運送車輛的空間納入考慮，他們共考慮以下三種情況：(1)工作由單一機
器加工後經由單一運送車輛運送至單一顧客所在地；(2)工作由一或兩部平行機
器加工後經由單一運送車輛運送至單一顧客所在地；(3)工作由單一機器加工後
經由單一運送車輛運送至不同的兩位顧客所在地。Li et al. (2004)亦將途程決策納
入單機排程的模式之中，但其假設此單一運送車輛服務多個位在不同地點的顧
客，而且其目標為工作到達顧客手中的時間總和為最小。 
生產排程與配銷規劃是企業經營運作的兩個重要工作，根據過去的相關文獻
顯示，生產排程與配銷規劃是各自獨立的兩個工作，在進行生產排程時，不考慮
配銷的顧客（或零售商）數目及所在位置、忽略途程安排、假設配銷的車輛數及
其容量皆夠多且足以做到即時配送，甚至不考慮產品運輸時間的情況；在進行配
銷規劃時，忽略生產現場的流程型態、不考慮工作的先後順序安排、甚至不考慮
人員及機器等資源的數量限制等；這種生產排程與配銷規劃各自獨立運作的情
形，除了不符實際狀況外，也可能導致不良的決策。因此，在強調供應鏈管理的
今日，如何整合生產排程與配銷規劃這兩項工作是一個重要的課題。 
Chang and Lee (2004)是最早探討每一工作佔用運送車輛的不同空間的作

已知且固定； 
(7) 假設訂單的被加工時間、工廠的配送車輛數目、每部車的容量限制、以及每

customer areas. Li et al. [14] developed a single machine 
scheduling model incorporating routing decisions of a 
delivery vehicle serving multiple customers at different 
locations. Except for multiple customer locations Li et al. 
[14] set the sum of job arrival times as the objective. 
 
Chang and Lee [1] studied, for the first time, problems in 
which each job might occupy differing amounts of 
physical space in a transport vehicle. Based on machine 
scheduling and finished product delivery as discussed by 
Chang and Lee [1], this study deals with the situation in 
which jobs are processed on a single machine and 
delivered by a single vehicle to two customer areas. The 
objective is to determine the job processing sequence in 
the shop together with the delivery schedule to minimize 
the mean arrival time. This study presents an integer 
programming models for optimal mean arrival time. Also, 
computational results of the illustrative example are 
reported using the integer programming model to solve 
the proposed problem. 
 
 
2.  Problem Description and Notation  
     Definition 
 
This study investigates a class of the two-stage scheduling 
problem where the first stage is job production and the 
second is job delivery. The investigative focus is on 
integrating production scheduling with delivery of 
finished products to two customer areas. In this problem, 
jobs are first processed in a single machine then delivered 
in batches by a vehicle to multiple customer areas. Jobs 
require varying physical space while being loaded into a 
vehicle and delivered to a single customer. The vehicle is 
associated with a capacity constraint, measured by the 
total physical space of the jobs it can deliver in one trip 
and has a specific transportation time for each delivery. 
Job completion time denotes the time when a job arrives 
at the customer. This study aimed to minimize mean 
arrival times of all jobs to the customer. 
 
The proposed problem was described as follows. A set of 
n jobs, N = {J1, J2, …, Jn}, had first to be processed in a 
manufacturing system by a single machine and then 
delivered to two customer areas. Each job, Ji, needed a 
processing time of pi in the manufacturing system. Let ei 
be the size of Ji, representing the physical space Ji 
occupied when loaded in the vehicle. One vehicle was 
available for delivery, with a capacity of z and was first 
located at the manufacturing facility. Vehicle capacity 
was measured by the total physical space the vehicle 
provides for one delivery. Assuming that while the total 
physical space of jobs loaded did not exceed z, they could 
be arranged to fit in the physical space provided by the 
vehicle. A delivery batch denotes all jobs delivered 
together in one shipment and a transportation time is 
associated with each delivery batch. Furthermore, we 
define two customer areas as two locations. In this study, 
the situation of deliveries made to two customer areas was 
considered. Let tjj′ be the two-way travel time from 
customer area j to customer area j′, where j, j′ = 0, 1, 2. 
Specifically, the location of single machine is called area 
0. 
 
The following notation was used throughout the study: 
Ji  = job number i;  
Bk  = the kth delivery batch;  
H  = a very large positive number;  
n  = number of jobs for processing at time zero;  
z = the vehicle capacity, that is, the total physical space 
provided by the vehicle for one delivery; 
ei = the physical space Ji occupies when loaded in the 
vehicle; 
pi = the processing time of Ji;  
Qs = the number of route types which belong delivery 
type s. Q1 = Q2 = 3 and Q3 = 6. 
tjj′ = the travel time from the area j to the area j′; 
uij = 1 if Ji must be delivered to area j; 0 otherwise; 
Ai = the arrival time of Ji, that is, the time when the 
vehicle finished delivering Ji to the customer area;  
dk = the departure time from the machine for the vehicle 
to deliver Bk; 
rk = the ready time of Bk, representing the latest 
completion time on the machine of the jobs 
assigned to Bk on the machine. Note uk ≥ rk in any 
feasible solution; 
s
kqV  = 1 if route type q belongs delivery category s at 
batch Bk; 0 otherwise; 
wk = 1 if batch Bk is not null batch; 0 otherwise; 
Wkj = 1 if batch Bk must be delivered customer area j; 0 
otherwise; 
Yik = 1 if Ji was scheduled at batch k; 0 otherwise; 
 
 
3.  The Optimization Model 
 
The optimization model employed integer programming 
technique to find the optimal solution for the proposed 
problem. 
 
The objective was found in Eq. (1). The objective was to 
minimize the average arrival time of the set of orders 
during the time horizon.

5.  Conclusion and Future Research 
 
This study considers single machine scheduling for jobs 
delivered to two customer areas. The objective was to 
minimize mean arrival time. An integer programming 
formulation was proposed to find the optimal schedule. 
Computational results of the illustrative example are 
reported using the integer programming model to solve 
the proposed problem. Future research should address 
problems with multiple customer areas or different shop 
environments, including flow-shop and job-shop. 
Problems with other performance measures, including 
minimum mean flow time, mean tardiness, and multi-
criteria measures, should also be studied. Meta-heuristics 
could be used to achieve solutions.

concentrates on the delivery of finished jobs to customer(s) (Type-2 transportation as defined by
Lee and Chen (2001)).
Potts (1980), and Hall and Shmoys (1992) studied a single machine problem with unequal
job arrival and delivery times. The authors provided a heuristic and a worst-case analysis,
implicitly assuming that there were enough vehicles such that whenever a job was completed on a
machine the product was delivered immediately to its customer. Zdrzałka (1995) and Woeginger
(1998) investigated a single machine scheduling with equal job arrival times, unequal job
delivery times, and sequence-independent batch set-up times. They demonstrated the polynomial
time approximation scheme for the problem. Liu and Cheng (2002) considered a single machine
preemptive scheduling with unequal job arrival and delivery times, presenting a dynamic
programming algorithm and a polynomial time approximation scheme. Woeginger (1994) studied
parallel machines with equal job arrival times and unequal job delivery times. He gave some
heuristics with a constant worst-case bound guarantee. Gharbi and Haouari (2002) considered
parallel machines with unequal job arrival and delivery times. They presented two variants of a
branch and bound algorithm for obtaining optimal solutions of the problem with makespan as the
criterion.
Problems in which jobs are delivered to customers in batches have seldom been addressed.
Among the several survey papers on scheduling and batching problems include those by Potts
and Van Wassenhove (1992), Webster and Baker (1995), Potts and Kovalyov (2000), and Hall
and Potts (2003). Herrmann and Lee (1993), Chen (1996), Cheng et al. (1996), Yuan (1996),
Equi et al. (1997), Hall and Potts (2000), and Wang and Cheng (2000), Garcia et al. (2004)
considered machine scheduling problems with jobs delivered in batches after being processed.
Each delivery batch incurred a certain transportation cost. However, the above authors did not
consider transportation times, that is, instantaneous deliveries were assumed.
Lee and Chen (2001) have incorporated transportation time and vehicle capacity
requirements into machine scheduling models. They analyzed the complexity of various models
in which jobs were first processed by machines then delivered by one or more vehicles to a single
customer. The vehicles have finite or infinite capacity and there is a transportation time for each
direction of the delivery. Chang and Lee (2004) have extended Lee and Chen’s (2001) work to
the situation when each job occupies a different amount of space in the vehicle. They discussed
three scenarios of the problem, including: (1) jobs which are processed on a single machine and
delivered by a single vehicle to one customer area; (2) jobs which are processed by either one of
two parallel machines and delivered by a single vehicle to one customer area, and (3) jobs to be
processed by a single machine and delivered by a single vehicle to two customer areas. Li et al.
(2004) developed a single machine scheduling model incorporating routing decisions of a
delivery vehicle serving multiple customers at different locations. Except for multiple customer
locations Li et al. (2004) set the sum of job arrival times as the objective.
Chang and Lee (2004) studied, for the first time, problems in which each job might
occupy differing amounts of physical space in a transport vehicle. Based on machine scheduling
and finished product delivery as discussed by Chang and Lee (2004), this study deals with the
situation in which jobs are processed on a single machine and delivered by a single vehicle to
multiple customer areas. The objective is to determine the job processing sequence in the shop
together with the delivery schedule to minimize the total tardiness. This study presents three
integer programming models for optimal total tardiness. Size complexity of the models is
reported. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the studied problems as

3. THE OPTIMIZATION MODEL
The optimization model employed integer programming technique to find the optimal
solution for the proposed problem. Three integer programming models were presented. The
proposed three models are Models 1, 2, and 3. Model 1 is presented for the problem
P1(M1)Rr|v = 1, c = z|Ti, while Models 2 and 3 are for P1(M1)Rr|li, v = 1, c = z|Ti. Model
2 adopts the concept of assignment problem to formulate the proposed problems, while Model 3
bases on the dichotomous constraints models.

ensured that if vij = 0 then Ai = 0. Finally, constraint set (18) specifies the non-negativity of Ti, Ai,
rk, and uk, and establishes the binary restrictions for Yik and Wjjk.
3.2 Model 2
Model 1 is to solve the problem P1(M1)Rr|v = 1, c = z|Ti, while Model 2 is for
solving the problem P1(M1)Rr|li, v = 1, c = z|Ti. The extending constraints for Model 2 are as

Constraints (19) and (20) are the classical assignment problem, with (19) insuring that
each job is assigned to just one sequence position, while (20) insures that each sequence position
is filled with only one job. Constraint set (21) defines the earliest start time of the job in the
sequence position j on the machine, while constraint set (22) is essentially definitional.
Furthermore, constraint set (23) defines the completion time Ci on the machine.
Constraint sets (5) can be rewritten as constraint sets (24).
rkCi + H (1–Yik) i, k = 1, 2, …, n (24)
Constraint set (25) specifies the non-negativity of Ti, Ai, hq, fq, rk, and uk, and establishes
the binary restrictions for Xiq, Yik, and Wjjk.
Ti0 i = 1, 2, …, n; Ai0, Ci0 i = 1, 2, …, n;
hq0, fq0 q = 1, 2, …, n;

Xiq and Yik are binaries i, q, k = 1, 2, …, n
Wjjk is binary j, j= 0, 1,…, m; k = 1, 2, …, n (25)
Hence, Model 2 is comprised of (1)-(4), (6)-(17), (19)-(24), and (25).
3.3 Model 3
According to the concept of dichotomous constraints, constraint sets (19)-(23) can be
rewritten as constraint sets (26)-(29).

Cisi + H Zii 1i < in (27)

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH
This study considers single machine scheduling for jobs delivered to multiple customer
areas. The objective was to minimize the total tardiness. Three integer programming models were
presented. The proposed three models are Models 1, 2, and 3. Model 1 is presented for the
problem P1(M1)Rr|v = 1, c = z|Ti, while Models 2 and 3 are for P1(M1)Rr|li, v = 1, c =
z|Ti. Model 2 adopts the concept of assignment problem to formulate the proposed problems,
while Model 3 bases on the dichotomous constraints models. Model 3 is theoretically the better
model than Model 2 according to the analysis of size complexity of the models. Future research
should address problems with different shop environments, including flow-shop and job-shop.
Problems with other performance measures, including minimum mean arrival time, minimum
mean flow time, and multi-criteria measures, should also be studied. Meta-heuristics could be
used to achieve solutions.

ABSTRACT 
Coordinating activities among supply, production, and delivery is an important issue for 
production and logistics management. In this study, a single machine scheduling model was 
developed that incorporated order release and delivery vehicle routing decisions which serves 
a single customer location. The objective is to minimize the makespan. The problem is NP-
hard in the strong sense in general. Two integer programming models were developed to 
optimally solve this problem. Also, three efficient heuristics were proposed for solving large-
sized problems. The results of computational experiments are reported. 
 
Key Words: Scheduling, Integer programming, Heuristic, Supply chain management, 
Makespan, Single machine. 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
A supply chain is a network of interlinked suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and 
customers. Supply chain management represents a new focus on how to link organizational 
units to best serve customer needs and to improve the competitiveness of a supply chain 
(Stadtler 2004). The coordination of activities along different stages of a supply chain has 
received much attention in production and operations management research. The tendency has 
created closer interactions between the stages in a supply chain increasing the usefulness of 
integrated models. In such an integrated system, the linkage between order scheduling (the 
production stage) and finished goods delivery (the distribution stage) is very important 
(Chang and Lee 2004). Traditional approaches separately and sequentially consider machine 
scheduling and order delivery, without effective coordination between the two. However, 
making two individual but uncoordinated decisions will not necessarily produce a global 
optimal solution. Substantial ineffectiveness may result when decision-making between the 
two stages is poorly coordinated, particularly if transportation is scarce in the system. 
Lee and Chen (2001) investigated machine scheduling problems with precise 
transportation considerations. Two types of transportation situations are considered in their 
paper. Type-1 is transportation of orders from one machine to another for further processing. 
Type-2 is the transportation provided to delivery of finished orders to their destinations. The 
 3
The proposed problem was described as follows. A set of n orders, N = {O1, O2, …, On}, 
had first to be processed in a manufacturing system by a single machine and then delivered to 
a single customer. Each order, Oi, needed a processing time of pi in the manufacturing system. 
Let ei be the size of Oi, representing the physical space Oi occupied when loaded in the 
vehicle. One vehicle was available for delivery, with a capacity of z and was first located at 
the manufacturing facility. Vehicle capacity was measured by the total physical space the 
vehicle provides for one delivery. Assuming that while the total physical space of orders 
loaded did not exceed z, they could be arranged to fit in the physical space provided by the 
vehicle. A delivery batch denotes all orders delivered together in one shipment and a 
transportation time is associated with each delivery batch. Furthermore, we define a single 
customer area as a location. In this study, the situation of deliveries made to just one customer 
area was considered. Let t01 be the one-way travel time between the single machine (called 
machine 0) and the single customer area (called area 1). 
The problem was to find a schedule for processing and delivering finished orders to the 
customer in the minimal time required for all orders in N to be processed and delivered. For 
convenient analysis, the makespan of schedule σ, denoted as Cmax(σ), is defined in this paper 
as the time when the vehicle finishes delivering the last batch to the customer site and returns 
to the machine. To avoid ambiguity, this is simplified as Cmax(σ) to Cmax. 
The three-field notation scheme, α|β|γ, introduced by Graham et al. (1979), was applied to 
represent the problems being studied. In the three-field scheme, α was the scheduling 
environment, β described order characteristics or restrictive requirements, and γ defined the 
objective function to be minimized. In the α field, ‘‘Pp(Mm)→Rr” represents the scheduling 
environment of p plants, m machines, and r retailers. r = 1 indicated that retailers were located 
in one retailer area; hence all orders in a batch were delivered at the same time. In the β field, 
“li, v =, c =” represented the orders have different release times, v is the number of vehicles, 
and c is vehicle capacity. For example, P1(M1)→R1|li, v = 1, c = z|Cmax denoted the proposed 
problem with single-plant, single-machine, one retailer, and one vehicle carrying processed 
orders with total sizes no more than z, with the objective of minimizing the makespan.  
The following notation was used throughout the study: 
M  = a very large positive number;  
n  = number of orders for processing at time zero;  
Oi  = order number i;  
ei = the physical space Oi occupies when loaded in the vehicle; 
t01 = the one-way travel time between the single machine (called machine 0) and the single 
customer area (called area 1); 
z = the vehicle capacity, that is, the total physical space provided by the vehicle for one 
delivery; 
Bk  = the kth delivery batch;  
BPk  = the sum of the processing times of all orders in batch Bk; 
pi = the processing time of Oi;  
li = the release time of Oi;  
Xij = 1 if Oi was assigned to sequence position j on the machine; 0 otherwise; 
Yik = 1 if Oi was scheduled at batch k; 0 otherwise; 
Zii′ = 1 if Oi precedes Oi′ (not necessarily immediately) on the machine; 0 otherwise; 
uk = the departure time from the machine for the vehicle to deliver Bk; 
rk = the ready time of Bk, representing the latest completion time on the machine of the 
orders assigned to Bk on the machine. Note uk ≥ rk in any feasible solution; 
Ai = the arrival time of Oi, that is, the time when the vehicle finished delivering Oi to the 
customer site;  
si = the starting time of Oi on the machine; 
 5
could not equal 1 for k = 1, 2, …, n − 1. That is, if no orders placed at batch number k then 
also no orders placed at batch number k + 1. Constraint set (4) restricted the total batch size to 
vehicle capacity. Constraints (5) and (6) are the classical assignment problem, with (5) 
insuring that each order is assigned to just one sequence position, while (6) insures that each 
sequence position is filled with only one order. Constraint set (7) defines the earliest start time 
of the order in the sequence position j on the machine, while constraint set (8) is essentially 
definitional. Furthermore, constraint sets (9) and (10) define the completion time Ci on the 
machine and the ready time rk, respectively. Constraint sets (11) to (13) state the departure 
time uk. Constraint set (14) defines the arrival time Ai, while constraint set (15) measures 
makespan of the set of orders. Finally, constraint set (16) specifies the non-negativity of Cmax, 
hj, fj, Ai, uk, and rk, and establishes the binary restrictions for Xij and Yik. 
3.2.  Model 2 
According to the concept of dichotomous constraints, constraint sets (5)-(9) can be rewritten 
as constraint sets (17)-(20). 
 Ci ≤ si′ + M (1 – Zii′)   1 ≤ i < i′ ≤ n  (17) 
 Ci′ ≤ si + M Zii′   1 ≤ i < i′ ≤ n  (18) 
 si ≥ li   i = 1, 2, …, n  (19) 
 Ci = si + pi   i = 1, 2, …, n  (20) 
Constraint sets (17) and (18) meet the requirement that only one order can be processed at any 
time, that is, either Ci ≤ si′ or Ci′ ≤ si will hold. Incorporation binary variable Zii′ and a very 
large positive number M, equations (17) and (18) together ensure that one of these two 
constraints holds while the other is eliminated. Constraint sets (19) and (20) define the 
starting time si and the completion time Ci , respectively. 
The non-negativity of Cmax, Ai, Ci, si, uk , and rk, and the binary restrictions of Yik and Zii′ 
are specified in (21). 
 Cmax ≥ 0; Ai ≥ 0, Ci ≥ 0, si ≥ 0  i = 1, 2, …, n; 
  uk ≥ 0, rk ≥ 0   k = 1, 2, …, n; 
  Yik is binary   i, k = 1, 2, …, n 
  Zii′ is binary   1 ≤ i < i′ ≤ n (21) 
Hence, Model 2 is comprised of (1)-(4), (10)-(15), and (17)-(21). 
3.3.  Comparisons of the above proposed models 
The above two proposed models adopt different viewpoints to formulate the same problem 
and share a common objective of solving the problem. Model 1 adopts the viewpoint of 
assignment problem, while Model 2 employs the dichotomous constraints to formulate the 
proposed problems. Size complexity indicates how large a problem is in terms of binary 
variables, constraints, and continuous (real) variables as a function of n, the number of orders, 
in the problem. Table 1 lists the size complexity of each of the two mixed BIP models. 
 
Table 1. The size of integer programming model 
 
Model Number of binary variables Number of constraints 
Number of continuous 
variables 
Model 1 2n2 4n2 + 9n − 1 5n + 1 
Model 2 (3/2)n2 − (1/2)n 3n2 + 7n − 1 5n + 1 
 
As Table 1 shows, Model 2 has the same number of continuous variables as Model 1, but 
has (1/2)n2 + (1/2)n fewer binary variables and n2 + 2n fewer constraints. Consequently, 
Model 2 is theoretically the better model than Model 1.

 r1 = BP1  (22) 
 rk = rk−1 + BPk   k = 1, 2, …, b  (23) 
The departure time from the machine for the vehicle to deliver Bk is as follows. 
 u1 = r1  (24) 
 uk = max{uk−1 + T, rk}   k = 2, 3, …, b  (25) 
Let the makespan obtained from Heuristic H1 be Cmax(H1). It is expressed as follows. 
 Cmax(H1) = ub + T  (26) 
 
Heuristic H2 
Heuristic H2 is identical to Heuristic H1 except for Step 2 and Step 4, which is replaced by 
Step 2′ and Step 4′ as follows. 
Step 2′: Calculate the sum of processing times for orders in Bk denoting it BPk, for k = 1, 
2, …, b. Re-index the batches such that BP1 ≥ BP2 ≥ … ≥ BPb.  
Step 4′: Dispatch each finished but undelivered batch whenever the vehicle is free. If multiple 
batches have been finished when the vehicle becomes available, dispatch the batch 
with the largest index. 
 
The following notations are used in Heuristic H3. 
PEst = the partial schedule of the (st − 1) schedule batches; 
Est  = the set of batches schedulable at stage st, i.e., all the batches that must precede those 
in Est are in PEst; 
 
Heuristic H3 
Step 1: Assign orders to batches by the FFD algorithm. Let the total of resulting batches be b. 
Orders within each batch according to the Theorem 1. 
Step 2: Let st = 1 with PE1 being null. E1 is the set of all batches with no predecessors.  
Step 3. Find r* = minBk in Est{rk}. If there is a tie, choose one batch with the smallest value of 
the sum of processing times. Set batch *kB  with r
*.  
Step 4. Add batch *kB  to PEst and delete batch *kB  from Est. Increase st by 1.  
Step 5. If there are any batches left unscheduled (st ≤ b), go to step 3. Otherwise, stop. 
 
5.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Computational experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of 
the two-phase integer programming model and the proposed heuristic algorithm. The heuristic 
algorithm was coded in C language and the random data were also produced by a program 
coded in C language. The mixed binary integer programming formulations were coded in 
ILOG OPL and solved with OPL CPLEX. Both the mixed binary integer programming model 
and the proposed heuristic algorithm were tested on a PC PIV/2.67GHz with 512M DRAM. 
Both size (physical space) and order processing times were generated randomly from a 
discrete uniform distribution in a range of 1 to 10. The order release time was generated from 
two discrete uniform distributions in two ranges of 0 to 15 and 16 to 30. Both z and T are 
equal to 10 and 20. 
The test problems were divided into two sets, one comprising problems whose optimal 
solutions were identified quickly by solving the integer programming formulations, and the 
other containing problems with unknown optimal solutions. Four problem sizes, n = 10, 20, 
and 30, were tested for the integer programming model in the first set and ten test problems 
were generated for each problem size. Five problem sizes were tested in the second set, 
 9
including minimum mean arrival time, minimum mean flow time, mean tardiness, and multi-
criteria measures, should also be studied.

ABSTRACT 
In this study, a single machine scheduling model was 
developed that incorporated delivery vehicle routing 
decisions which serves two customer areas. The objective 
is to minimize the mean arrival time. The problem is NP-
hard in the strong sense in general. The integer 
programming model was developed to optimally solve 
this problem. Also, computational results of the 
illustrative example are reported using the integer 
programming model to solve the proposed problem. 
 
KEY WORDS 
Scheduling, single machine, integer programming, arrival 
time 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The coordination of activities along different stages of a 
supply chain has received much attention in production 
and operations management research. The tendency has 
created closer interactions between the stages in a supply 
chain increasing the usefulness of integrated models. In 
such an integrated system, the linkage between job 
scheduling (the production stage) and finished goods 
delivery (the distribution stage) is very important [1]. 
Traditional approaches separately and sequentially 
consider machine scheduling and job delivery, without 
effective coordination between the two. However, making 
two individual but uncoordinated decisions will not 
necessarily produce a global optimal solution. Substantial 
ineffectiveness may result when decision-making between 
the two stages is poorly coordinated, particularly if 
transportation is scarce in the system. 
 
Lee and Chen [2] investigated machine scheduling 
problems with precise transportation considerations. Two 
types of transportation situations are considered in their 
paper. Type-1 is transportation of jobs from one machine 
to another for further processing. Type-2 is the 
transportation provided to delivery of finished jobs to 
their destinations. The following study concentrates on the 
delivery of finished jobs to customer(s) (Type-2 
transportation as defined by Lee and Chen [2]). 
 
Problems in which jobs are delivered to customers in 
batches have seldom been addressed. Among the several 
survey papers on scheduling and batching problems 
include those by Potts and Van Wassenhove [3], Webster 
and Baker [4], Potts and Kovalyov [5], and Hall and Potts 
[6]. Herrmann and Lee [7], Chen [8], Cheng et al. [9], 
Yuan [10], Equi et al. [11], and Wang and Cheng [12], 
Garcia et al. [13] considered machine scheduling 
problems with jobs delivered in batches after being 
processed. Each delivery batch incurred a certain 
transportation cost. However, the above authors did not 
consider transportation times, that is, instantaneous 
deliveries were assumed.  
 
Lee and Chen [2] have incorporated transportation time 
and vehicle capacity requirements into machine 
scheduling models. They analyzed the complexity of 
various models in which jobs were first processed by 
machines then delivered by one or more vehicles to a 
single customer. The vehicles have finite or infinite 
capacity and there is a transportation time for each 
direction of the delivery. Chang and Lee [1] have 
extended Lee and Chen’s [2] work to the situation when 
each job occupies a different amount of space in the 
vehicle. They discussed three scenarios of the problem, 
including: (1) jobs which are processed on a single 
machine and delivered by a single vehicle to one customer 
area; (2) jobs which are processed by either one of two 
parallel machines and delivered by a single vehicle to one 
customer area, and (3) jobs to be processed by a single 
machine and delivered by a single vehicle to two

customer areas. Li et al. [14] developed a single machine 
scheduling model incorporating routing decisions of a 
delivery vehicle serving multiple customers at different 
locations. Except for multiple customer locations Li et al. 
[14] set the sum of job arrival times as the objective. 
 
Chang and Lee [1] studied, for the first time, problems in 
which each job might occupy differing amounts of 
physical space in a transport vehicle. Based on machine 
scheduling and finished product delivery as discussed by 
Chang and Lee [1], this study deals with the situation in 
which jobs are processed on a single machine and 
delivered by a single vehicle to two customer areas. The 
objective is to determine the job processing sequence in 
the shop together with the delivery schedule to minimize 
the mean arrival time. This study presents an integer 
programming models for optimal mean arrival time. Also, 
computational results of the illustrative example are 
reported using the integer programming model to solve 
the proposed problem. 
 
 
2.  Problem Description and Notation  
     Definition 
 
This study investigates a class of the two-stage scheduling 
problem where the first stage is job production and the 
second is job delivery. The investigative focus is on 
integrating production scheduling with delivery of 
finished products to two customer areas. In this problem, 
jobs are first processed in a single machine then delivered 
in batches by a vehicle to multiple customer areas. Jobs 
require varying physical space while being loaded into a 
vehicle and delivered to a single customer. The vehicle is 
associated with a capacity constraint, measured by the 
total physical space of the jobs it can deliver in one trip 
and has a specific transportation time for each delivery. 
Job completion time denotes the time when a job arrives 
at the customer. This study aimed to minimize mean 
arrival times of all jobs to the customer. 
 
The proposed problem was described as follows. A set of 
n jobs, N = {J1, J2, …, Jn}, had first to be processed in a 
manufacturing system by a single machine and then 
delivered to two customer areas. Each job, Ji, needed a 
processing time of pi in the manufacturing system. Let ei 
be the size of Ji, representing the physical space Ji 
occupied when loaded in the vehicle. One vehicle was 
available for delivery, with a capacity of z and was first 
located at the manufacturing facility. Vehicle capacity 
was measured by the total physical space the vehicle 
provides for one delivery. Assuming that while the total 
physical space of jobs loaded did not exceed z, they could 
be arranged to fit in the physical space provided by the 
vehicle. A delivery batch denotes all jobs delivered 
together in one shipment and a transportation time is 
associated with each delivery batch. Furthermore, we 
define two customer areas as two locations. In this study, 
the situation of deliveries made to two customer areas was 
considered. Let tjj′ be the two-way travel time from 
customer area j to customer area j′, where j, j′ = 0, 1, 2. 
Specifically, the location of single machine is called area 
0. 
 
The following notation was used throughout the study: 
Ji  = job number i;  
Bk  = the kth delivery batch;  
H  = a very large positive number;  
n  = number of jobs for processing at time zero;  
z = the vehicle capacity, that is, the total physical space 
provided by the vehicle for one delivery; 
ei = the physical space Ji occupies when loaded in the 
vehicle; 
pi = the processing time of Ji;  
Qs = the number of route types which belong delivery 
type s. Q1 = Q2 = 3 and Q3 = 6. 
tjj′ = the travel time from the area j to the area j′; 
uij = 1 if Ji must be delivered to area j; 0 otherwise; 
Ai = the arrival time of Ji, that is, the time when the 
vehicle finished delivering Ji to the customer area;  
dk = the departure time from the machine for the vehicle 
to deliver Bk; 
rk = the ready time of Bk, representing the latest 
completion time on the machine of the jobs 
assigned to Bk on the machine. Note uk ≥ rk in any 
feasible solution; 
s
kqV  = 1 if route type q belongs delivery category s at 
batch Bk; 0 otherwise; 
wk = 1 if batch Bk is not null batch; 0 otherwise; 
Wkj = 1 if batch Bk must be delivered customer area j; 0 
otherwise; 
Yik = 1 if Ji was scheduled at batch k; 0 otherwise; 
 
 
3.  The Optimization Model 
 
The optimization model employed integer programming 
technique to find the optimal solution for the proposed 
problem. 
 
The objective was found in Eq. (1). The objective was to 
minimize the average arrival time of the set of orders 
during the time horizon.

Constraint sets (8) and (9) define binary variable Wkj. If 
batch Bk must be delivered to customer area 1, then Wk1 = 
1. Otherwise Wk1 = 0. That is, ∑  ≤ H × W=ni iki Yu1 1 k1 and 
Wk1 ≤ H ∑=ni iki Yu1 1 . Similarly, If batch Bk must be 
delivered to customer area 2, then Wk2 = 1. Otherwise Wk2 
= 0. That is, ∑=ni iki Yu1 2  ≤ H × Wk2 and Wk2 ≤ 
H∑=ni iki Yu1 2 .  
Constraint set (3) ensured that if ∑  = 0 then 
 could not equal 1 for k = 1, 2, …, n − 1. That is, 
if no orders placed at batch number k then also no orders 
placed at batch number k + 1.

We introduce binary variable wk to describe whether 
that batch Bk is null batch or not. Constraint set (5)

Constraint set (6) restricted wk = 0 if batch Bk is null 
batch.

If batch Bk is not a null batch, then there has job(s) must 
be delivered to one or two customer areas. There are three 
delivery categories to the customer areas, including 
deliver only to area 1, deliver only to area 2, and deliver 
to both areas 1 and 2. Figure 1 illustrates that there are 
three delivery types for delivering only to area 1, that is, 
Q1 = 3. Figure 2 illustrates that there are three delivery 
types for delivering only to area 2, that is, Q2 = 3. Figure 3 
illustrates that there are six delivery types for delivering to 
both areas 1 and 2, that is, Q3 = 6.

If batch Bk is not a null batch, then the route type is just

4.  An Illustrative Example 
 
The proposed integer programming model is illustrated 
here. Six jobs (n = 6) are to be scheduled, namely J1 to J6. 
In this example, there are six jobs, one machine, two 
customer areas and one vehicle with a capacity of 10 (z = 
10). Processing time is p1 = 2, p2 = 1, p3 = 5, p4 = 2, p5 = 
6, p6 = 5. The physical space is e1 = 5, e2 = 2, e3 = 4, e4 = 
8, e5 = 2, e6 = 6. The number of route types are Q1 = 3, Q2 
= 3, Q3 = 6. The two-way travel time between machine 
and customer area is as follows.
