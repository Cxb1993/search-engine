ABSTRACT
A fuzzy-based Kalman filter is proposed for time-varying
multipath fading channel in a multicarrier code-division
multiple access (MC-CDMA) system. The radio channel
is modeled as an autoregressive random process. The pa-
rameters of the AR process and the channel gain are simul-
taneously estimated. One-step ahead prediction can also
be obtained during the channel estimation. It is useful for
the decision-directed channel-tracking design, especially in
the fast fading channel. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed method can track the channel more accurately
than the conventional channel estimators.

Multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA),
fuzzy-based Kalman filter, autoregressive (AR) random
process, decision-directed channel-tracking design.
1 Introduction
Multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA)
is a new communication technique that integrates the
merits of both orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing (OFDM) and code-division multiple-access (CDMA)
schemes. It can be robust against the intersymbol inter-
ference (ISI), multiuser interference, and multipath fading
[1]. To support high-bit-rate links in the future, the MC-
CDMA system has been considered as one of the possible
candidates for the next generation of wireless communica-
tions.
The MC-CDMA system divides the available band-
width into a large number of narrow subchannels and
spreads each data symbol in the frequency domain by trans-
mitting all the chips of a spread symbol at the same time,
but in different orthogonal subchannels [2]-[3]. One of the
properties of multicarrier transmission is that the channel
gain of each subchannel is different from each other. The
inner product of different spreading codes will no longer
be zero since the MC-CDMA systems spread transmitted
symbols in a non-flat fading channel. This leads to the loss
of orthogonality between different users. The multiple ac-
cess interference (MAI) is introduced and the performance
will be severely degraded in this case. In order to pre-
serve the orthogonality between different users, the chan-
nel impairment should be estimated precisely and equal-
ized efficiently. Different research approaches have been
adopted for channel estimation and tracking. The pilot-
symbol-aided channel-estimation methods in both time and
frequency domains have been proposed [4]. A channel-
sounding approach is employed in which a train of pulses
in periodically transmitted [5]. A multiple-channels model,
which includes several possible channel models based on
the different ranges of Doppler frequencies (or mobile ve-
locities), is constructed to treat the time-varying fading
channel [6]. In addition, a decision-directed channel es-
timation in the frequency domain using Kalman-based fil-
ter has been proposed [1]. It does not require any over-
head symbols. However, the decision-directed scheme has
a delay problem that the current data detection must adopt
the former channel-estimation result. This will lead to a
deterioration of the detection performance in a fast fading
channel because the previous channel is not suitable for the
current data detection. Therefore, an accurate prediction is
necessary for the decision-directed channel-tracking algo-
rithm to improve the performance [7].
A time-varying velocity of the mobile station com-
municated in the MC-CDMA system is considered in this
paper. The spectral characteristics of the communication
channel can be approximated as an autoregressive (AR)
process with a white Gaussian process input [8]. The pa-
rameters of the AR process and the variance of the input
process are determined by the velocity of the mobile sta-
tion. Since the velocity is time-varying and unavailable for
a handset in the realistic application, a nonlinear state equa-
tion can be used to describe the MC-CDMA system. The
extended Kalman filter (EKF) is suitable for nonlinear es-
timation. However, it is only the first-order approximation
to the nonlinear estimation and needs the computation of
Jacobians to linearize the process and measurement equa-
tions [9]. In this regard, the fuzzy theorem has been re-
cently applied in various fields, such as control systems
[10], signal processing [11] and communication systems
[12]. The fuzzy systems are considered to be universal ap-
proximators for certain nonlinear systems in most of these
applications. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is fre-
quently adopted due to its simplicity and efficiency. Based
on the T-S fuzzy model, a fuzzy Kalman filter is proposed
[13] for nonlinear channel estimation and prediction with-

3 Fuzzy-Based Channel Tracking
3.1 Subcarrier Channel Estimation
For the Rayleigh fading channel, an AR process can match
its special characteristics [8]. The second-order AR model
(AR(2)) is adopted here due to its simplicity and accuracy.
The lth path of the channel impulse response at the nth
MC-CDMA symbol can be modeled by
hn(l) = a1,n−1hn−1(l) + a2,n−1hn−2(l) + wn(l),
l = 0, 1, ..., L− 1 (8)
where wn(l) is a complex zero-mean white Gaussian pro-
cess. The parameters a1,n and a2,n are determined by the
Doppler frequency shift due to the velocity change of the
mobile station. They are defined as
a1,n = 2rd cos (2πfD,nT ) , a2,n = −r2d (9)
where fD,n is the maximum Doppler frequency shift in
the nth symbol period and rd is the pole radius that corre-
sponds to the steepness of the peaks of the power spectrum
[8]. The radius is chosen very close to one to model the
spectral peaks at the maximum Doppler frequency of the
fading channel.
The channel-estimation method is performed in the
frequency domain. Hence, the time-domain AR pro-
cess of Rayleigh fading channel must be transformed to a
frequency-domain AR process. Taking the N -point DFT
of hn(l), we have
Hn(m) =
N−1∑
l=0
hn(l)e
−j2πlm
N =
L−1∑
l=0
hn(l)e
−j2πlm
N
= a1,n−1Hn−1(m) + a2,n−1Hn−2(m) +Wn(m),
m = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, (10)
where
Wn(m) =
L−1∑
l=0
wn(l)e
−j2πlm
N .
Since the velocity of the mobile station is time-varying and
unavailable, the parameter a1,n is time-varying too. For
the best channel estimation, one way is to jointly estimate
Hn(m) and a1,n. However, the joint estimation is nonlin-
ear from (10) because of coupling. It is not easy for any
linear estimation method to estimate the state. The fuzzy
filter is adopted in this paper to get more accurate result
than EKF for nonlinear parameter-estimation problem.
From (6) and (10), the channel model can be de-
scribed by the following state-space equations:
Xn(m) = G (Xn−1(m)) +Wn(m) (11)
Yn(m) = Jn(m)Xn(m) + Vn(m) (12)
where
Xn(m) =
[
a1,n Hn(m) Hn−1(m)
]T
, (13)
Jn(m) =
[
0 Sn(m) 0
]
, (14)
Wn(m) =
[
wa,n Wn(m) 0
]T
, (15)
G (Xn(m)) =
⎡
⎣ a1,na1,nHn(m) + a2,nHn−1(m)
Hn(m)
⎤
⎦ , (16)
and wa,n is assigned to simulate the variation of velocity
as a random walk, G is a nonlinear function of the state
Xn(m).
If the velocity of the mobile station is known, the
above state-space equation can be simplified as a linear
model
Xn(m) = Dn−1Xn−1(m) +Wn(m)
Yn(m) = Jn(m)Xn(m) +Vn(m) (17)
where
Dn−1 =
⎡
⎣ 1 0 00 a1,n−1 a2,n−1
0 1 0
⎤
⎦ .
Because the mobile velocity is unknown to the system, the
fuzzy-based Kalman filter is proposed for nonlinear state
estimation. The index m is omitted in the following com-
putation since the procedure of the fuzzy-based Kalman fil-
ter computation is the same for all subchannels.
3.2 Fuzzy-based Kalman Filter for a Time-Varying
Channel Estimation
The T-S fuzzy system can be viewed as a somewhat piece-
wise linear function, where the change from one piece to
the next is smooth rather than abrupt due to the interpo-
lation of the weighting functions. Since the state-space
model is linear if the velocity of the mobile station is

4 Computer Simulation
A computer simulation has been conducted to confirm the
performance of the proposed method. The urban case is
considered. Table 2 shows the power delay profile in the
urban area with the RMS delay στ = 1 μs. The mobile
velocity from 5 to 110 km/hr are used to simulate different
mobile environments. The central frequency f c is 2 GHz
in the MC-CDMA system. The total bandwidth BW is
2.048 MHz which is divided into 1024 subchannels. The
subchannel spacing is then Δf = 2 kHz. An additional
8μs guard-interval duration is used to provide protection
from ISI due to the channel multipath delay spread. The
length of the adopted Walsh-Hadamard code is N = 64
chips. Thus, the MC-CDMA system can support the maxi-
mum 64 active users. The AR(2) model parameters, a1 and
a2, are defined in (9). The parameter of the pole radius is
chosen as rd = 0.998 for the simulation cases [8]. It is
also assumed that the channel remains approximately con-
stant during one MC symbol period. The data modulation
scheme is QPSK in the following simulation.

delay (μs) 0.0 0.2 0.5 1.6 2.3 5.0
Fractional power 0.189 0.379 0.239 0.095 0.061 0.037
The performance of the systems is measured by the
mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, with sim-
ulation for 50 trials and 2000 MC-CDMA symbols per trial.
The MSE of the channel estimation is defined as
MSE =
N−1∑
m=0
E
{∣∣∣Hn(m)− Hˆn(m)∣∣∣2
}
.
The user’s velocity is a random variable and varies
with time in the realistic applications. Thus, a fuzzy fil-
ter has been proposed to jointly estimate the dynamics
and path gains of channel via nonlinear estimation. In or-
der to simulate a velocity-varying mobile radio channel,
the velocity of the mobile station is assumed to be a ran-
dom variable uniformly distributed in the range from 5
km/hr (fDT = 0.0047) to 110 km/hr (fDT = 0.1034)
with different signal to noise ratios (SNR) in each trial.
The initializations of Xˆ0 and P0 are set to [1.85 0 0]T and
diag(
[
10−5 10−5 10−5
]
), respectively. The MSEs of es-
timation and prediction using different methods are com-
pared in the Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The 2-D pilot-
added channel-tracking method is given in [15]. The time-
domain pilots are spaced by a minimum coherence time
Tcoh, which is equal to the reciprocal of a double maximum
Doppler frequency Tcoh = 12fD . Both of the previously
presented 1st-order Kalman filter [1] and the 2nd-order
Kalman filter [16] are failed because these two methods
adopt fixed dynamics. The EKF is less accurate than the
proposed method, although it can also be used for the non-
linear estimation. Therefore, the proposed method can get

5 Conclusion
A robust channel-tracking method has been presented
for fast time-varying multipath fading channel in a MC-
CDMA system. The channel model is described by a
nonlinear state-space equation. The state includes the
gains and dynamics of the channel. The proposed fuzzy-
based decision-directed channel-tracking scheme can es-
timate the state via a nonlinear estimation to achieve ro-
bustness for the time-varying velocity. The delay problem
of the decision-directed scheme can be solved if the pro-
posed method is used. Simulation results indicate that the
proposed method can track the channel more accurate than
the other methods. Therefore, the proposed fuzzy-based
decision-directed channel tracking for MC-CDMA systems
is very useful for a user with time-varying velocity over a
fast multipath fading channel.
