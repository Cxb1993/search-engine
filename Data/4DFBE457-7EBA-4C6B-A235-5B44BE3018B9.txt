降低外，更可為製造商帶來更多營收，此時即使單位產品外包成本再高，製造商
亦可積極尋找外包廠商，盡量滿足顧客需求量。隨著需求波動延續時間增加，固
定調整成本與需求波動延續時間之臨界值逐漸上升，表示製造商較傾向進行供應
鏈網路調整，這是因為調整所帶來的整體效益大於調整所需支付的固定成本。若
製造商僅針對短期需求波動進行調整，則當調整所需支付成本較高時，所滿足的
需求量無法有效分擔高額調整成本，在調整效益小於調整成本情況下，不建議調
整。在需求低迷情況下，研究結果顯示，此時因各晶圓廠產能利用率低，具高額
生產成本。為因應此不可靠情形，本研究建議可以較具經濟效益的晶圓廠生產，
為達規模經濟效果最大。 
於高科技產業差異化服務週期策略之研究，研究結果顯示，當需求量已達運
輸規模經濟，此時運送服務次數可較頻繁，又因為拿到產品所需平均時間因高配
送頻次而縮短，顧客選擇目標製造商機率提升，有助於提升目標製造商產品市場
佔有率；另一方面，若需求量未達經濟運輸規模時，製造商會指派較少頻次服務，
以降低運輸成本。研究結果亦顯示，影響顧客服務頻次因素除顧客需求量外，生
產據點與顧客間距離亦為影響因素之一，兩地間距離會同時影響顧客選擇目標製
造商機率以及物流成本，若製造商指派具顧客區位較近的生產據點服務該顧客，
則顧客選擇機率可因運送時間縮短而增加、物流成本更可因低運輸成本下降，進
一步目標製造商若再以高頻次運送服務策略服務該區位顧客，更可同時因高需求
量以及運輸規模經濟效果造成之低物流成本，使得總利潤增加。航空貨運航線需
求模式之結果與利用時間序列的灰色預測模式預測貨運量之結果比較，發現經由
探討各產業選擇機率後，再加總預測之航空貨運量較為準確，與實際航空貨運量
的誤差較小。透過供需互動之規劃模式，在台北至香港航線以及台北至日本航線
的單位基本運費以及航班頻次應略為增加，由於這兩航線之航空貨運需求量仍有
成長空間，可藉由提高頻次吸引更多的客源，而略微調漲基本費率可使利潤增
加。比較藉由供需互動模式之規劃下與將需求視為外生下之規劃結果，數值分析
結果顯示，透過供需互動模式所規劃之最適航班頻次與單位基本運費，確實可使
航空貨運業者的年利潤增加。 
本研究在學術貢獻上可補過去文獻之不足，亦期能提供相關問題之其他學術
研究之參考。而在實務上，可提供廠商與航空貨運業者於全球運籌與動態需求下
之供應鏈與航空貨運網路設計決策，及研擬相關營運規劃及行銷策略之參考。

for firm’s product.  Furthermore, this study develops a MIP model for determining 
the optimal delivery service cycles for customers in different regions and the 
assignment of plants to customers, taking into account demand-supply interactions.  
In the third year, this study not only investigates the relationship between air cargo 
demand and world trade due to the specialization and evolution of industrial structure 
around the world but also proposes an airfare, flight frequency and aircraft type 
programming model for airline’s cargo network by considering close demand-supply 
interaction.  This study formulates a disaggregate choice model to analyze the 
impacts of product values, distance as well as supply attributes, such as airfare and 
flight frequency on the optimal shipping mode choice.  The air cargo demand is 
estimated by aggregating individual firm’s choice based on the probability distribution 
of the value of products, which are made in different industries.  Then, this study 
formulates a mathematical programming model to determine flight frequencies and 
basic airfares on individual routes of an air cargo network with demand-supply 
interactions by maximizing the carrier’s total profit. 
Finally, a series of case studies about the selected high-tech product firms and air 
cargo carrier are provided to illustrate the results and the application of the developed 
models.  Consequently, the expected results of the developed models can provide 
basis on studies regarding procurement decisions, product delivery strategy and air 
cargo network design.  Furthermore, the results may shed light on high-tech product 
firms and air cargo carriers regarding their decision-making on key-component 
procuring, product delivery strategy, marketing and operating strategies under global 
logistics and dynamic economic environment.

此種物流操作則屬小量高頻次的運送方式(Transporting parts in frequent shipments 
of small lots)，雖可滿足顧客需求，然當運送量未達流量匯集經濟時，即時運送
常導致高額運輸成本。另一方面，由於主要顧客據點遍佈各個不同經濟區域，且
各具不同時間相依需求型態(time-dependent demand pattern)，若對所有顧客採相
同運送頻次，則利潤可能會因顧客不同達交時間(fulfillment time)要求而蒙受損
失。實務上，廠商雖可藉由投入額外設備與成本時間，使得產品能快速交至顧客
手中，然若能從基本面分析不同地區需求型態以及上下游地理區位分佈，考慮顧
客需求與廠商物流運送供給成本互動關係，對廠商之營運規劃而言，將更具決策
彈性與參考價值。 
上述分析係針對廠商與上游供應商及與下游顧客間之物流關係與營運規劃
課題進行分析。而為使產品、零組件、半成品等能快速行銷至世界各地，航空運
輸則為國際間高科技產品配送之最主要運輸方式。就航空運輸方面，波音公司世
界航空貨運(World Air Cargo Forecast 2004/2005)預測報告指出，2001 年經濟不景
氣與恐怖攻擊等事件，使得全球航空貨運量銳減 5.8%，但 2002 年之貨運量則增
加超過 7%，而 2003 年並未受到 SARS 之衝擊，全球年貨運量成長率約為 4%。
該報告預測航空貨運量在未來 20 年增加為目前之三倍，平均年成長率約為
6.2%。近年來，亞洲航空貨運市場帶動全球空運市場之發展，在亞洲地區內部平
均年成長率為 8.5%，而中國國內空運市場年成長率則為 10.6%。根據財政部之
統計資料顯示，1999 年美國為台灣主要出口地區，其貿易額約占整體之 25.41%，
但到了 2004 年則減少為總出口貿易額之 16.16%，在 1999 年台灣出口總額在亞
洲地區約為 48.69%，而 2004 年台灣之出口地區以亞洲區域內貿易為主，約占總
出口貿易額之 62.04%，其中香港與中國大陸約占總出口貿易額之 45.89%。在 1990
年台灣地區之紡織業出口金額占總額之 15%，機械及電機產品出口金額占出口總
額之 34%，而 2004 年紡織業減少為 7%，機械及電機產品金額則超過出口總額
之一半。由上述實務資料分析可知，全球產業結構與各區位專業分工情況逐年動
態變化且密切影響航空運輸的需求，由於運輸為衍生需求，航空貨運服務績效亦
影響廠商選擇使用航空運輸的意願，進一步影響航空貨運公司利潤。若能考量全
球產業結構變化以及經濟景氣循環預測航空貨運需求量的影響，並以供需互動角

於廠商與上游零組件採購、供應商關係方面議題，過去已有大量文獻針對影
響供應商選擇因素進行探討(e.g., Champman and Carter, 1990; Weber and Current, 
1993)，影響供應商選擇的因素可概分為價格、品質與運送可靠度 (delivery 
reliability)(Stadtler and Kilger, 2002)。另一些研究則考慮供應商選擇之量化成本影

更具環境因應與決策彈性之參考基礎。 
1.2 研究目的 
本研究計畫於產業景氣與動態變化下，探討供應鏈管理課題中夥伴關係合約
制定與產品運送網路與頻次規劃問題，以及航空貨運量之動態變化與航空貨運機
隊與頻次規劃課題，分為三年期研究計畫。 
第一年期計畫針對供應鏈網路設計課題，考量高科技產品需求量變動與不確
定特性所衍生之不可靠情況和對應的成本，構建能同時考量生產規模經濟與需求
變動之景氣波動下製造商供應鏈網路調整模式，期能反應未來景氣需求不確定之
生產與廠商夥伴關係建立課題，提供規劃者在多變的市場經濟環境下，進行最適
供應商選擇和生產量配置等決策。第二年期計畫針對產品配送課題，考量不同區
位顧客需求隨時間分佈以及上下游地理區位廣佈特性，規劃能因應時間、空間相
依需求特性與同時考量供給與需求面之顧客最適服務週期策略。第三年期計畫主
要以航空貨運業為研究對象，分析不同產業各廠商最適運具選擇因素，探討各起
迄對貿易量與航空貨運量之動態變化，進行航空貨運量預測，並探討航空貨運業
供給因素與供需互動情形，分析最適航空貨運基本費率、航線和班機頻次等決
策。本研究之具體研究目的，分述如下： 
第一年期之研究計畫係著眼於高科技產品需求不確定與動態變化對廠商供
應商選擇與零組件採購規劃策略的影響。過去已有研究針對供應商選擇影響因素
進行分析，或以廠商角度探討不同折扣係數與合約訂定方式對採購量的影響。上
述決策係屬長期規劃課題，然高科技產品需求具隨景氣動態變化特性，需求量遽
增或低迷和不同需求狀況延續時間均可能為廠商營運帶來衝擊。由於供應商選擇
與零組件訂購策略係依據最終產品需求情況為基礎而訂定，除廠商需考量不同需
求狀況以及成本考量進行零組件採購規劃，供應商最適零組件定價和供給亦受總
體市場零組件需求量影響，在產品需求量變動的影響下，廠商掌握未來需求變
動，進行供應商夥伴關係之建立，以及制定零組件採購策略等，皆為廠商營運之
重要課題。本研究第一年期研究計畫之具體目的如下：

研究，大多偏重於探討前置時間與存貨策略間關係，或在需求不確定之下，探討
最適訂購策略；或是以顧客角度探討即時運送服務策略帶來的益處，然而廠商提

模式，針對依時性產品需求與市場空間分佈特性，探討不同配送服務策略對顧客
服務績效與廠商營運成本的影響。本研究第二年期計畫以生產據點遍佈全球各地
的廠商為研究對象，考量不同地區顧客需求隨時間與空間分佈，提出差異化服務
週期策略，亦即研究期間內各區位顧客被服務的週期均不相同，構建非線性混合
整數規劃數學模式，以廠商於研究期間內利潤最大化為目標，考量供需互動並滿

每月生產量、各顧客於研究期間內最適服務週期以及顧客各服務週期該由哪些生
產據點提供服務以及其運送量。本研究第二年期研究計畫之具體目的如下： 
1. 探討廠商制定各顧客服務週期重要考慮因素，包括各區位顧客依時性需求特
性、區位間的運輸條件，以及產品存貨成本、各生產據點所在區位與生產條
件等，建立研究期間內，反應時間相依需求下之單位產品平均供給成本函
數，包含生產成本、運輸成本與存貨成本，其中生產成本與各生產據點產能、
區位以及生產量有關，運送成本包含運送固定成本與運送變動成本，前者隨
運送頻次增加，後者則為與每次運送量有關的變數，此外，運送固定與變動
成本均為與距離相關之變數；而存貨成本則包含運送途中與因等待所產生的
機會成本。上述成本均與各配送週期內服務的顧客區位與每次配送量有關。 
2. 分析服務週期規劃對不同顧客的影響，探討廠商產品定價與下訂單至實際拿
到商品所需時間對顧客選擇廠商行為影響，其中，產品定價係與單位產品平
均供給成本有關；下訂單至實際拿到商品所需時間則與服務週期制定以及顧
客與生產據點平均距離有關。進一步，藉由不同區位顧客於不同時間的需求
量與服務週期關係，總計研究期間內廠商產品總需求量。 
3. 以最大化研究期間內廠商利潤為目標，考量供需互動關係以及滿足各生產據
點產能限制，構建反應時間與空間相依需求特性之差異化服務週期策略數學
規劃模式，並以模擬退火法為基礎發展演算法，以求解所構建之非線性混和
整數數學規劃模式。 
4. 以高科技產品廠商為例，蒐集本模式中主要供需參變數之實際資料或進行合
理之假設，包含顧客效用函數參數值、廠商生產據點與顧客區位分佈、時間

進行案例分析及重要參變數之敏感度分析，並闡述本研究實務上應用的可行
性與管理意涵。 
第三年期之研究計畫以航空貨運業為研究對象，首先針對廠商航空貨運需求
面進行探討，探討不同產業各廠商因不同起迄點、產品價值、託運量以及航空貨
運業者提供之頻次、運價對選擇航空運輸運送貨物的意願之影響程度，進一步，

來決定訂貨時間及數量，則配銷商所看到的是一個高度變異性的訂貨模式；4. 價
格波動：當價格波動時，零售商會在價格低時囤積貨物，如此也會增大長鞭效應；
5. 誇大訂貨量：當配銷商或零售商預期某一產品即將缺貨時，會多訂一些此類
產品，如此將增大長鞭效應。由上述歸納因素可知長鞭效應係屬短期操作上的課
題。為降低長鞭效應對企業營運績效的影響，後續研究分別探討長鞭效應對存貨
的影響，以及提出因應策略以降低長鞭效應。 
就量化長鞭效應與探討其對存貨的影響，Lee et al. (1997) 提出隨機數
學規劃模式探討「長鞭效應」，量化因需求預測、定量配額 (rational game) 、
批量訂購、價格波動所產生的長鞭效應，並研討降低長鞭效應的方式，如：
降低因需求預測所產生的長鞭效應可用賣方代管存貨(Vendor Management 
Inventory, VMI)、快速回應系統與銷售點管理(Point Of Sales, POS)資料；降
低因定量配額所產生的長鞭效應可透過第三方物流的合作與簽訂交貨協
定；降低因價格波動所產生的長鞭效應可使用每日最低價  (Every Day 
Lowest Price, EDLP) 策略。Metters (1997) 除量化長鞭效應外，更以動態規
劃探討因季節性需求變動與預測誤差所產生的長鞭效應對企業利潤之影
響，並發現降低季節性需求變動的長鞭效應可使利潤提高 10-20%；提升需
求預測的準確度可使利潤增加 5-20%。有鑑於消費者需求為影響上游廠商存
貨的重要因素，過去已有研究針對需求資訊的傳遞與預測對存貨成本與訂購
策略之影響 (e. g., Cachon and Fisher, 2000; Gavirneni et al., 1999, 2002)。研
究結果均顯示，有效的需求預測與即時需求資訊可使供給者的存貨成本降
低。 
Bourland et al. (1996) 探討當需求預測技術由傳統統計每期需求資料替
代為將每日實際銷售資料直接傳遞至上游廠商的適時需求資訊  (timely 
demand information, TDI) ，對供應鏈層級中廠商與零售商的影響，並發現
利用 TDI 可大幅降低廠商的存貨並同時提高服務水準與降低成本。Berman 
and Kim (2001) 亦針對以網際網路傳遞訂貨資訊的供應鏈存貨策略探討，模
式考量普以松消費者抵達過程、指數服務時間，構建馬可夫決策問題，在最

策略，調整成隨需求與產品製造週期變動的動態補貨策略。Dejonckheere et al. 
(2003) 提出以控制理論方法降低長鞭效應，研究首先量化長鞭效應，並以
存貨上限(order-up-to)補貨規則並使用不同需求預測技術下之長鞭效應，研
究結果顯示，利用存貨上限補貨規則總是會產生長鞭效應。 
Croom et al. (2000) 整理以往供應鏈管理文獻，並將過去供應鏈管理文

2.2 供應鏈網路設計模式之研究 
過去相當多文獻針對供應鏈網路設計進行探討，根據 Chopra and Meindl 
(2004)，供應鏈網路設計問題相關決策如下：生產區位選擇與最適廠房數量、
各生產據點之最適產能與生產量、供應商選擇、以及由哪個生產據點或倉庫服
務哪個市場等。簡言之，供應鏈網路設計問題即為決定各層級最適節點、上下
游層級節點間關係以及流量關係。過去關於供應鏈網路設計文獻，Arntzen et al. 
(1995) 以 Digital Equipment Corporation 進行實證分析，該公司利用 Global 
Supply Chain Model (GSCM) 進行重新整合的工作，這套軟體主要針對多產品
製造、廠房分佈、生產層級和配銷流程中的屬性進行分析評估，包括時間、成
本與產能，目標式為最小化總系統成本和生產與配銷時間之加權，並以滿足需
求、各國貿易限制 (關稅等) 、產能和生產週期等為限制，進行供應鏈網路設
計，決策變數包含生產區位選擇、生產、存貨與運送最適數量。 
Nagurney et al. (2002, 2003, 2005)以網路均衡模式探討供應鏈網路設計問題。
Nagurney et al. (2002) 構建一靜態競爭性供應鏈網路均衡模式，透過網路分析
的概念探討通路成員之最佳決策行為，模式假設供應鏈中層級包括廠商、零售
商與最終市場，該研究定義節點（node）表示供應鏈中所有競爭市場之成員，
根據不同成員之特性，構建成本函數；而節線（arc）則表示連結兩節點間的
路段(link)，並透過均衡條件探討供應鏈成員最適價格與節線流量，Nagurney et 
al. (2003) 以網路均衡模式探討層級包含廠商、零售商與消費者之供應鏈網路
問題，研究假設層級間參與者為合作關係而層級內參與者為競爭關係，利用變
分不等式(variational inequality)推導最適產品運送數量與價格。然本研究未以
範例分析闡述模式的應用與可行性。Nagurney et al. (2005)構建電子業廢棄物
回收之逆供應鏈網路模式，探討於電子商務情境下，廠商、通路商、零售商決
策行為。進一步，Nagurney and Toyasaki (2005)構建均衡模式，探討供應鏈中
多位獨立之決策者間的競爭關係。Tsiakis and Papageorgiou (2008) 在操作性與
財務限制下，探討供應鏈管理課題中之生產與配銷網路問題。 
Melachrinoudis et al. (2005)以 physical programming approach 探討倉儲中
心網路設計問題，模式以決策者角度，綜合考量不同衡量準則，包含成本、服
務績效以及效益等，決策對現有倉儲網路之合併或是淘汰等策略。研究結果顯

 18
Gargeya (2005) 回顧以全球供應鏈為主之決策輔助模式，並評估實務上操作與
學術之不同。該文獻並列表比較各文獻的不同，包含決策變數、績效評估項目、
供應鏈整合層級數等，其中決策變數均含生產據點選擇、生產量與供應商選擇
等，而目標式則多為最小化總成本或最大化利潤。該文獻並提出跨國供應鏈管
理需特別強調過去文獻較少探討的重要議題，如整合企業內部製造與外部供應
商區位。Vidal and Goetschalckx (1997) 以全球供應鏈模式為範圍，整理與探
討以生產-配銷模式為主之文獻，該研究將文獻以不同主題分類探討，包含以
發表先後順序之文獻、數學規劃模式、其他議題與實例分析與應用等。由該研
究可知，過去供應鏈網路設計問題大多以混合整數數學規劃模式(mixed integer 
programming, MIP)呈現，且著重於模式之求解。 
由於供應鏈網路設計問題較為複雜，且決策變數眾多，過去研究多採用拉
式鬆弛法(Lagrangian relaxation)、 分枝定限法(branch-and-bound)、網路單體
法 (network simplex)、Benders 分割法 (Benders decomposition)與主分解法
(primal decomposition methods)等(e.g., Jayaraman and Pirkul, 2001; Miranda and 
Garrido, 2004; Goetschalckx et al., 2002)，然上述研究多著重於發展演算法，並
比較演算法的效率與節省的成本。 
小結： 
回顧上述供應鏈網路設計相關文獻，對不同研究重點、領域方法作概括之
了解，大部分供應鏈網路模式是以混合性整數規劃模式呈現，而研究多為確定
性模式，對於不確定性經濟環境之分析，尚具研究空間。而相關網路設計規劃
問題之研究，則以數學規劃模式為基礎且多著重於一系列演算求解法之研究，
可作為本研究不同年期計畫求解上之參考，然過去相關研究尚未針對供需互動
關係、隨機性經濟因素變動以及依時性產品需求探討，且未將之整合於供應鏈
網路設計模式中。 
2.3 供應鏈整合與關係、供應商選擇之研究 
由於供應鏈中的上下游階層均由獨立企業構成，每個階層的目標有可能是相
衝突的，因此，有必要在供應鏈中的不同階層做整合，藉由整合機制可降低系統
成本，亦可同時考慮衝突的目標，整合項目包括買賣方整合 (buyer-vendor 
coordination)(e.g., Tzafestas and Kapsiotis, 1994; Viswanathan and Piplani, 2001)、生
產-配銷整合(production-distribution coordination)(e.g., Goetschalckx et al., 2002; 
Cohen and Moon, 1991)與存貨-配銷整合(inventory-distribution coordination)(e.g., 
Fu and Piplani, 2004; Chen et al., 2001)等。 
傳統整合機制包括垂直和水平整合、發展供應鏈夥伴關係如販售商代管存貨
(Vendor Management Inventory, VMI)、訂定契約和利潤共享等。過去亦有學者探
討分散式(decentralized)供應鏈即每階層依其企業目標與限制，作最佳決策和集權
 20
Chou el at. (2001) 利用羅吉斯模型(logistic model)描述生命週期較短的產品，例
如：高科技產品，logistic model 可用以描述一項商品的推廣期、成長期、成熟期
與衰退期之軌跡。在假設商品價格不隨時間變動下，構建每一個運送週期的單位
時間成本，並以啟發式演算法求解，探討依消費者需求分佈的送貨排程問題。 
另外，亦有學者提出不同存貨策略以整合供應鏈。Viswanathan and 
Piplani(2001)針對一個供應商與數個零售商的供應鏈，基於運輸成本之考量，
提出供應商補貨週期，與提供零售商價格折扣，誘使零售商依循這種補貨策
略，模式以 Stackelberg 賽局理論為基礎，並求得最佳補貨週期與價格折扣。
Cheung and Lee (2002)假設由供給者至零售商的運輸前置時間為固定與需求服
從普以松分配(Poisson distribution)下，利用 VMI 整合供應商運送商品給下游
零售商的工作，研究結果顯示，當參與此計畫的零售商越多，個別零售商的單
位時間成本越低，然而這種降低的情況為規模經濟遞減。Fu and Piplani (2004)
主要以供給面的配銷商角度探討其與供應商整合的問題，文中提出兩個情境，
一為配銷商與供應商獨立作存貨決策；二為配銷商考量供應商的存貨資訊以作
最佳存貨決策。並以模擬方式針對上述兩種情境進行分析，由於配銷商補貨時
間與供應商存貨策略有關，因此，考量供應商存貨資訊的配銷商其服務績效較
佳。 
Li et al. (2006) 以五個向度，包含策略伙伴關係、顧客關係、資訊分享程
度、資訊分享品質和延遲製造，探討供應鏈管理實務、競爭優勢與企業績效間
關係。該研究收集 196 筆企業資料，以結構方程式(structural equation modeling)
方法檢驗研究提出的假說。研究結果顯示，供應鏈管理實施的程度越高，該產
業具高度競爭優勢與企業績效。由於製造業公司常面臨市場需求波動問題，為
因應此變動對企業營運績效帶來的影響，Lloréns et al (2005) 探討製造彈性與
廠商策略改變(strategic change)間之關係，該研究係以線性結構關係(Linear 
Structural Relations, LISREL)方法，確認模式間變數的關係適配性以及影響程
度。 
Hull (2005)結合經濟學理論與供應鏈管理，以需求與供給面的價格彈性觀念
探討供應鏈績效議題，該研究以經濟學最基礎的彈性公式推導供應鏈在面臨以下
四種狀況的績效：(1)市場需求激增; (2)產能增加; (3)當需求激增或供給衝擊對生
產量分配的影響;(4)價格折扣或成本上升對生產量的影響。該研究並分別針對三
種不同市場競爭情況推導上述四種狀況的績效: (1)完全競爭市場; (2)庫諾競爭下
整個市場衝擊(Market shock); (3)庫諾競爭下單一企業衝擊(Single firm shock)。本
研究可供管理者在面對市場供給或需求改變時，根據其產品特質與競爭強度制訂
因應措施。表 2.2 為整理供應鏈整合與績效相關文獻。 
 22
於供應商選擇方面，由於全面品質管理(Total quality management, TQM)
與即時交貨(Just in time, JIT)已為現今企業管理的重要概念，使得供應商選擇
之課題更顯重要。Roethlein and Mangiameli (1999)以 Stanley Engineered 
Components 為例，探討企業實施 TQM 對供應商的影響，文中提及，為爭取
惠普企業(Whirlpool Corporation)的長期合約，Stanley Engineered Components
花了三年半的時間已達到惠普企業的標準，且經由企業改造以達到惠普企業的
要求，Stanley Engineered Components 也已轉型成為有能力以專業知識協助顧
客解決生產最終產品的企業。 
在供應商關鍵選擇因素與評估方式探討之研究中，大多研究係以定性方式
分析，收集實證資料以統計方法或層級分析法(Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP)
探討供應商選擇重要因素(e.g., Verma and Pullman, 1998; Jahnukaiene and Lahti, 
1999)，可歸納影響供應商選擇的重要因素包括零組件品質、零組件價格、配
送績效、前置時間長短等供應商屬性，然無法從中確實分析供應商提供之折扣
策略與合約長短等因素對供應商選擇的影響，且無法得知廠商在選擇不同區位
與生產能力的供應商時對成本與效益影響程度。而於 Verma and Pullman (1998)
研究中指出，雖然管理者認為「品質」是選擇供應商時最重要的因素，但在實
際選擇時，其主要依據卻是「成本」與「配送績效」。 
另一些研究則考慮供應商選擇之量化成本影響(e.g., Li and Kouvelis, 1999; 
Mantrala and Raman, 1999)。Ganeshan et al. (1999)考慮動態環境下，企業選擇
使用兩家供應商之供應商選擇問題。該研究以前置時間平均值與變異數作為供
應商選擇可靠度評估基礎，並預先假設兩家供應商可靠度高低不同，藉衡量折
扣係數與運輸成本、存貨成本之權衡取捨關係，分析採用兩家供應商的成本。
現今企業與供應商多採一年以上之合約方式操作，然上述研究多係針對單一時
期之供應商選擇課題進行未考量未來需求不確定對供應商選擇以及合約制定
的影響。 
尚有一些研究探討供應商合約課題。Bassok and Anupindi (1997)假設需求
不確定情況下，探討定期盤點存貨(periodic review inventory)環境下之訂購量
問題，模式以存貨點的存貨上限(order-up-to levels)為概念，探討合約課題中最
小允諾訂購量課題，模式以折扣係數高低與存貨成本間權衡取捨關係，探討廠
商最終訂購量與存貨成本的關係。Li and Kouvelis (1999) 在具價格不確定性但
需求為已知的環境下對不同型態的供應合約進行評估，以探討供應商合約課
題，包括(1)不具時間彈性之合約(time-inflexible contract)：廠商須明確決定購
買數量以及時間；(2)具時間彈性之合約(time-flexible contract)：廠商僅需決定
於特定期間內要採購的數量；(3)數量彈性(quantity flexibility)：僅需決定採購
數量的上下界即可。該研究以採購成本與存貨成本之淨現值最小為目標，決定
在不同類型之合約中，廠商最適採購時點與數量。上述文獻研究範圍較屬於單

運產業為例，提出線上整合企業所有交易工作，亦即利用資訊流整合行銷、銀行、
配銷、庫存中心、存貨計畫、運送人(carrier)線上訂位等，使以往企業對企業
(Business to Business, B2B)的電子商務，提升至整個產業層級的電子商務運籌，
藉由整個產業的相關資料庫資訊，可提供航空貨運業者作更快與精確的決策。 
Lai et al. (2002) 以問卷方式檢視供應鏈在運送物流方面的績效，並將衡量績
效因素依對象分為三大類：對貨主而言的服務效能 (effectiveness)、物流業者營
運效率、對承銷者(consignees)而言的服務效能，對貨主與承銷者評估的因素又再
分為可靠性(reliability, REL)與負責(responsiveness, RES)兩大屬性，而對物流業者
而言，則分為成本相關(cost-related, COST)與資產相關(asset-related, ASSET)項。
校估結果顯示，文中所提之26個問項均為顯著，本研究之結果可供衡量供應鏈物
流運送方面績效之指標。Morash and Clinton (1997)更深入分析不同供應鏈架構，
物流運輸於整合供應鏈扮演的角色，以問卷調查方式研究位於澳洲、日本、韓國、
美國的兩千多家企業，將供應鏈結構分為供應鏈內部整合與供應鏈外部整合。研
究結果顯示，不同國家的企業視運輸在整合供應鏈中的功能不盡相同，例如：美
國企業較重視運輸的彈性與客製化，而日本重視的則是運輸帶來的縮短時間、JIT
運送、低物流成本、標準化的經營程序等功能，韓國亦較重視運輸的這些功能，
深究原因，可能是因為這些國家的地理範圍較小、人口稠密，基於基礎建設擴充
受限制，在物流運作上必須要更有效率。 
Geunes and Zeng (2001)探討於需求不確定且企業使用基本存貨水準
(base-stock)策略下，存貨短缺策略(inventory shortage policies)對運輸成本的影
響。本研究提出當缺貨時，企業可進行催貨或缺貨策略，當使用缺貨策略可降低
運輸成本，而可能增加缺貨成本，然當缺貨策略造成之運輸成本效益大於所增加
之缺貨成本時，企業提供價格折扣以彌補顧客因延遲拿到產品的損失。van Hoek 
and van Dierdonck (2002)更以實證研究探討延遲製造(postponed manufacturing)與
運輸功能的互補關係，研究結果顯示，目前第三方物流就延遲製造的功能而言，
僅以包裝、貼標籤等技術較低的工作為運輸的附加服務，較具技術導向的延遲製
造部分依然由製造部門進行。Kiesmüller et al. (2005)考量零組件補貨週期與最終
產品物流配銷以及產品製造特性之間關係，並主張最適運具選擇可延遲至所有產
品都已準備好被運送的狀態方始決定，該研究以存貨點的存貨上限(order-up-to 
levels)策略為例，構建同時考量運輸成本與存貨成本下最適運具選擇。研究結果
顯示，產品價值較低的產品較適合以慢速運具運輸；且使用快速運具帶來的效
益，如低存貨水準，無法抵銷高額運費。 
Chopra (2003)描述供應鏈中配銷網路架構，提出影響配銷網路選擇的因素，
並探討不同配銷網路的優點、缺點以及適用環境。該研究提及，越多服務據點
(如：生產據點、倉儲中心)，前置時間越短，而改變配銷網路設計所引發的成本
包含存貨成本、運輸成本、處理成本、設備成本與資訊成本，因此，當企業選擇
以越多服務據點服務顧客，則存貨成本、設備成本越高，而運輸成本則是先降後

航空貨運業的景氣動態變化與全球產業變化以及個別廠商決策規劃間之關係，並
構建數學規劃模式探討航空貨運業者之營運計畫應如何因應之重要性。本研究第
三年期研究計畫將針對航空貨運市場，分析不同產業各廠商之最適運具選擇決策
因素，考量全球區域產業結構的動態變化以及於各地理區位之各國經濟發展之消
長，所造成各起迄對之貿易量與航空貨運量之變化。進一步，分析航空貨運業者
規劃航線、班機與頻次之重要考量因素，和上述決策與航空貨運市場需求量之相
互影響關係以及對航空貨運業者追求利潤最大為目標的影響，期能提供航空貨運
業者更具因應環境動態變化與決策彈性之規劃參考依據。 
2.6 航空運輸需求預測 
Lave (1972) 衡量美國歷年之人口數，探討可支配所得、費率對於營運旅客
英哩之影響，應用多元回歸模式預測總營運旅客英哩 (revenue passenger mile, 
RPM)。Ippolito (1981) 以兩階段最小平方法校估航空需求與供給模式，探討航空
需求與供給之間的關係。在需求面探討航班頻次與承載率，而費率彈性、飛行距
離、所得與人口為外生變數；在供給面則以航空公司追求利潤最大化之目標下，
對於機位供給之決策。研究結果驗證服務品質變數對於航空需求之影響，指出航
空需求與航班頻次數成正相關，但與承載率為負相關。Nam and Schaefer (1995) 
以類神經網路(neural networks)預測國際航線旅客運量，以逆傳達學習演算法 
(backpropagation learning algorithm) 構建一類神經網路模式，不需統計分配之假
設，可將預測模式與決策過程結合，以提供決策時一參考準則。且將模式預測結
果之平均絕對誤差，與迴歸模式及指數模式相比較，以驗證其準確度。 
在分析公路貨運業之需求量之研究，大多針對每日之運量預測，提供貨運業
者一決策準則。Godfrey and Powell (2000)將基本的指數平滑模式擴展，衡量假日
或節日等影響公路貨運量，構建 DTMC 模式 (damped trend multi-calendar 
exponential smoothing)以預測每日公路貨運量，進一步與 ARIMA 比較其預測結
果，而該研究指出 DTMC 較容易執行，且其預測誤差較小、較為準確。Seabrooke 
et al. (2002) 以最小平方誤差回歸分析，預測香港海運量，其中考量多項總體經
濟指標，而直航或是中國大陸地區是否加入 WTO 等因素是為外生衝擊。研究結
果顯示香港海運量會隨著中國大陸南部地區貨運量成長而增加，與其他學者所預
測香港海運量，會因為鄰近地區費用低廉且較方便的港口服務產生而減少相異。 
Graham (1999)對於機場交通量預測之研究作一評論分析比較，許多研究以
重力模式，考慮兩點的人口生產量與距離關係，以預測兩地間之航空量。旅客在
選擇機場時，會考慮可及旅行時間、到達目的地的服務頻次以及費率等。另有研
究主要是探討各別機場的交通量，其模式衡量國民生產毛額、價格和地理位置特

2.8 機隊規劃與航線頻次 
Gordon and de Neufville (1973) 構建非線性數學規劃之直航網路設計模式，
在已知航空公司最大容量之情況下，追求班次延誤成本最小化，主要探討直航服
務型態之網路，求出最大化之服務水準，規劃最適航班頻次。Carter and Morlok 
(1975) 以整數規劃模式為基礎，探討航空網路排程與航班頻次之規劃，只考慮
單一機型，但在航線部分則考慮直航與停靠多點的轉運情形，以追求營運成本最
小化為目標，規劃最適航班頻次。 
Kanafani et al. (1982) 以最適頻次指派模式為基礎，加入衡量航線選擇模
式，探討航機技術與航空網路架構之間的短期關係。在需求與飛機技術已知的情
況下，以頻次指派模式與航線選擇模式，探討最適航機使用率以及最佳網路架
構。研究結果顯示，大型航機具有顯著之規模經濟性；而小型航機則有較佳的服
務水準，且對於空運中心的依賴性較小。未來的航機技術將有改善小型航機酬載
與飛航距離限制的趨勢，以降低小型航機的距離不經濟性。 
Teodorovic (1983) 衡量旅客服務水準，假設旅客選擇航班以最接近期望離開
時間為選擇之準則，進而以實際離開時間與期望離開時間差之絕對值估算旅客服
務水準，並規劃各城市對所應提供之航班頻次。Teodorovic and Krcmar-Nozic 
(1989) 建構多準則模式 (multicriteria model)，同時以追求最大利潤、最大旅客量
與最小旅客延誤成本下，規劃航空公司之航線頻次。該研究所探討之航線頻次問
題為規模較大的組合最佳化問題，因此根據摩特卡羅(Monte Carlo)的基礎，發展
一套啟發式解法，以求得研究模式之解。Teodorovic et al. (1994)以模糊集合理論 
(Fuzzy set theory) 為基礎，衡量航空運量預測的不確定性，建構數學模式以分析
航空網路設計與航線頻次規劃。模式主要分為兩個部份，一以模糊邏輯 (fuzzy 
logic) 為基礎找出可行路線以形成航線，另一部份以模糊線性規劃問題 (fuzzy 
linear programming problem) 為基礎建構模式，決定最適航線頻次。 
Antes et al. (1998) 以決策支援系統為基礎 (decision support system) 建構模
式，評估航空公司貨運航線之班表，研究對象為航空公司所營運之貨運航線，衡
量各航線之營運成本、營運收益以及利潤等因素，評估航空公司規劃之貨運航線
班表。而該研究所提出之模式尚可應用於其他方面，如在固定需求下，比較不同
航線排班對航空公司利潤之影響；找出航線排班所提供運輸容量而造成之瓶頸；
分析市場額外需求，探討航空公司之排班是否具有高利潤貢獻的潛能；藉由服務
需求改變與模擬方式，評估航空公司的航線排班是否具有可適應性 
(adaptability)。 
Chin and Tay (2001)以回歸分析檢視國內生產毛額、航空客運量與承載因子
等因素間關係，並以馬可夫模式探討成長率與利潤。當整體經濟繁榮可能直接促
使商務旅客增加，而間接提升個人所得，使休閒旅客增加。其研究結果顯示，當
航空公司成長率提升，則使利潤提高，因而公司決策將規模擴增，同時可使得生

於成本面，本研究將供應鏈網路成本分為三類討論，包括入向成本、生產成

或維修等費用，一般而言，產能越大的生產據點占地越大，且生產所需機具較多
或需先進技術，因此，大規模產能具高資本成本；生產變動成本為與生產量有關，
單位產品生產變動成本反應了生產所需投入之勞力、電力等投入項所需支付費

從 4.1.1 節可靠度分析結果，可知在需求變動下被判定為相對低可靠度的生
產據點。對於相對低可靠度的生產據點而言，由於原先規劃之產能在面對需求變
動下無法達到損益平衡/無法即時滿足顧客需求量，進而造成單位產品生產成本
遽增/需負擔懲罰成本，因此，製造商需針對被判定為不可靠的生產據點進行調
整，減少因需求變動所帶來之損失。一般來說，在景氣蓬勃時，由於顧客需求量
激增，使得原先規劃之產能達到飽和或超過，此時具有最大成本效益，然而，在
規劃產能無法滿足可能生產量下，表示製造商接了顧客訂單卻無法順利完成所有
生產或作業、或喪失訂單使得市場佔有率下降造成收益損失，本研究定義為此部
分成本為懲罰成本；在景氣低迷時，由於顧客需求量不如預期且驟減，各生產據
點可能生產量低於規劃結果，在此超額供給之下，使得生產據點產能利用率過
低，在生產量無法有效分擔高額資本成本下，單位產品平均生產成本遽增。綜上，
一個適當設計的供應鏈體系，應具有彈性策略(Flexible Strategies)，當外在環境變
異時，能使作業轉移到同一層級其他適當生產據點或尋求外包策略，並從中獲得
利益(Simchi-Levi et al., 2001)。進一步，本研究考慮若景氣波動即將發生，製造

可靠與不可靠作業活動之產能利用率流量於上述生產據點間的重新分配與衍生

應鏈網路設計模式除可決策各生產據點最適產能與生產量外，亦決定製造商各生
產據點與上游各供應商、下游顧客間之連結與流量關係；而景氣波動之供應鏈網
路流量重新分配模式則著重於生產據點間流量分配工作。以下將景氣波動情況分
為景氣蓬勃與景氣低迷進行討論與分析。 
4.1.2 景氣蓬勃之網路重新配置模式 
受景氣蓬勃影響，此時顧客需求遽增，可能生產量超過原規劃產能結果，在
這個情況下，生產據點因高產能利用率，而具成本效益，若此時生產量超過產能，
則產生懲罰成本，本研究構建一懲罰成本函數表示當作業活動無法即時滿足顧客
需求所需負擔的違約成本或因產能不足無法承接訂單之收益損失。另外，針對因

4.1.3 景氣低迷之網路重新配置模式 
受景氣低迷影響，此時顧客之需求量驟降，各生產據點可能生產量遠低於原
規劃結果，生產據點因產能利用率，生產量不足以分擔高額資本成本，此時具高
生產成本，此情況尤以當製造商營運高產能且位於高物價水準區位之生產據點為
嚴重。針對此不可靠情況，本研究提出生產量重新分配因應策略，不同於景氣蓬
勃，此時生產據點可能生產量過低。因這種分散生產的結果，使得製造商各生產
據點不具經濟效益。針對此不可靠情形，本研究提出併量之因應策略，亦即以少
數生產據點進行作業即可，換言之，將流量匯集於特定生產據點進行作業，以發
揮規模經濟效果。本研究於流量重新分配所產生之總成本包含生產量重新分配前
後之總生產成本差異、原物料調度成本、因生產據點與顧客間地理區位改變所需
負擔之運輸成本以及生產量重新分配所需之調整成本。繼而，構建因應景氣低迷
之供應鏈網路重新配置模式，以上述總成本最小化為目標，探討因應景氣低迷所
造成不可靠之網路流量重新分配問題。

由表 4.1 可知，於 T 公司服務的五個顧客區域中北美市場佔最多，其需求量
占 T 公司總產量約為 80%以上，其次為日本與歐洲區域，而來自台灣的需求量
則占最少數。 
於生產據點方面，T 公司可選擇的生產區位有五個，分別為台灣(新竹)、台
灣(台南)、上海、美國以及新加坡等地營運數量與產能不等的晶圓廠，平均而言，
一座晶圓廠的壽命為 25 至 30 年，就營建初期所需之資本成本，建造一座 12 吋、
8 吋或 6 吋晶圓廠需 30 億、10 億或 5 億美金資本成本，然上述成本會隨著各區
位土地取得成本等相關晶圓廠建廠成本有所差異，例如：美國與新加坡因其 GDP
與物價水準較高，使得 T 公司在此營運生產據點所需成本較其他據點來的高。又
由於薪資與生產所需水電費率等之物價水準不同，各生產據點各尺寸晶圓片單位
生產成本亦不相同。於產能方面，6 吋、8 吋、12 吋晶圓廠於技術成熟時之滿載
產出約為 82000 片、70000 片以及 50,000 片，以八吋晶圓換算可得上述各晶圓廠
的產能為 45920, 70000, 112500 片八吋晶圓當量。表 4.2 為於各生產據點營運不

由表 4.3 可知，T 公司為滿足高額需求，會選擇於五個生產據點營運六座晶
圓廠，其中新竹廠因為台灣政府獎勵高科技投資政策，其資本成本與生產成本均
較其他生產據點低，因此，T 公司於台灣(新竹)營運兩座 12 吋晶圓廠，且因高額
需求量之故，T 公司於其他生產據點亦可以最大產能, i.e. 12 吋晶圓廠，生產，並
規劃除新加坡廠外之晶圓廠產能利用率達 100%，而新加坡因生產成本較諸其他
生產據點來的高，雖需求量已足以分擔於該地營運 12 吋晶圓廠之高資本成本，
其生產量相對而言較低，產能利用率僅達 71.32%。以此產能規劃以及生產量分
配結果下之單位八吋晶圓平均生產成本為 322.85 美金，對照表 1，此生產成本比
以八吋晶圓廠生產之生產變動成本來的低。故以大規模產能生產並使生產達產能
滿載確實能發揮規模經濟效果，使單位產品生產成本降至最低。另由表 3 亦可得
知各晶圓廠服務的顧客，對照表 4.1，由於北美的需求量最高，占 T 公司產出約
達 80%，北美顧客需由多個晶圓廠服務，其餘顧客由於需求量較低，多由台灣(台

由表 4.4，可得各異常月份中國大陸地區顧客需求量期望波動值，且平均值

表 4.5 結果顯示，大陸地區顧客需求異常狀況將影響 T 公司生產據點(Fab)整體表
現，例如：台灣新竹兩座 12 吋晶圓廠、台灣台南、新加坡、美國的 12 吋晶圓廠
可靠度表現均低於 0.5。雖各 Fab 可靠度普遍偏低，然各 Fab 可靠度結果依製造
商訂定可靠度評估指標上下界，以及其產出占 T 公司總產出比值而有所不同。多
數晶圓廠的生產於規劃期間已達滿載，在顧客需求量異常增加的情況下，使得產
能無法負荷，其中以位於台灣的兩座 12 吋晶圓廠可靠度最低，這可解釋為 T 公
司對上述晶圓廠期望較高，可靠度評估指標上下界間距較狹窄；由於新加坡廠尚
有產能可生產，加上其可靠度評估指標上下界間距較寬鬆，於異常月份的可靠度
表現佳，可靠度評估結果在四至七月均有不錯表現。 
整合上述可靠度分析結果，可得於異常事件影響下不可靠月份， t {4, 5, 6,

由於除大陸地區顧客外，其他地區需求量波動情況均屬正常，僅需針對大陸

圖 4.1 單位產品外包成本與懲罰成本變動決策門檻值 
製造商於需求波動時，需謹慎衡量無法滿足需求之損失與為滿足需求所需支
付的額外成本對整體營運的影響，由圖 4.1 可清楚得知懲罰成本與外包成本變動
下最適調整決策。由圖 4.1 可知，當懲罰成本越小，則調整效益越有可能小於調
整成本，故越不建議調整，這是因為此時若進行調整，則生產成本降低以及免除
之懲罰成本無法抵銷高額之外包成本。由於單位產品懲罰成本可反應產品市場價
值，此結果可解釋為當產品價值越低時，進行調整以滿足高額市場需求為製造商
帶來的效益越小，越不建議製造商為此調整其網路；反之，產品價值越高，表示
一單位產品可為製造商創造的利潤越大，此時若進行調整，除生產成本可因此降
低外，更可為製造商帶來更多營收，此時即使單位產品外包成本再高，製造商亦
可積極尋找外包廠商，盡量滿足顧客需求量。上述分析可提供製造商於需求波動
時，針對產品不同懲罰成本與外包成本變動下，是否對供應鏈網路進行調整決策
之參考。 
製造商在決策是否調整時，除單位產品調整成本與外包成本外，亦需將波動
延續時間因素納入考量，本研究將固定調整成本定義為找尋合適外包廠商以及進
行各生產據點協調與生產線調度所需支付的成本，為與調整量以及總調整月份無

此種調整方式可為T 公司帶來大量成本效益。而原先由新加坡晶圓廠服務的歐洲

研究結果指出，當顧客需求量發生異常蓬勃時，產能為滿載的生產據點之可

第五章 高科技廠商服務週期策略規劃 
本研究主要以自行生產產品且運送產品至顧客端的高科技產品製造商為研
究對象，且該製造商於不同區位經營數個生產據點，假設各生產據點生產與配送
規劃均集中由廠商層級(經營者)決策。本研究探討時間、空間相依需求特性對廠
商指派生產據點服務不同區位市場顧客與服務週期之最適規劃的影響，提出差異
化服務週期策略之概念，即於研究期間內各區位市場顧客被配送的頻次並不相
同。於本研究中，顧客遍佈全球各區位，各具不同時間相依需求特性，因此，廠
商亦須考量各區位時間相依需求特性，規劃不同服務週期以服務各區位顧客，除
此之外，各生產據點與顧客並非一定位於同一區位，且不同生產據點與顧客組合
的距離遠近相異，廠商亦需決定各區位顧客需由哪個生產據點服務以及其配送產
品數量。

本研究首先令 s 表示特定顧客；k 表示特定生產據點。為深入探討時間相依

由式(5.10)可知，若多數顧客均以高配送頻次服務，引發運輸固定成本越多，

輸成本會隨著總運送量增加而下降。 
顧客服務週期規劃對存貨成本的影響可以不同角度分析：對廠商而言，若服
務頻次越高，則產品自生產完畢至配送至顧客間所需存放在生產據點處的時間越
短，所需儲放空間較小，廠商存貨成本越低，除此之外，顧客平均等候產品時間
可因高服務頻次而縮短，顧客服務績效上升，可進一步刺激需求，另一方面，顧
客存貨成本也可因這種少量多次的配送方式而降低，因此，高配送頻次可對廠商
與顧客兩造帶來成本效益，然在每次運送量未達規模經濟運送的情況下，少量多

被選擇的機會。然而，根據距離經濟的觀念，單位距離費率會隨著距離增加而
減少，因此當運送距離長時，即使是以高價空運方式運送貨品，貨主可能因為
航空運輸較節省時間，而不在意航空單位費率的多寡問題。 
當貨品交由航空運輸貨運業者運送貨品時，產品雖已產出卻無法即刻交送
至客戶端，使貨主無法使用或是賣出貨品所損失的價值或所需負擔的機會成
本，即為存貨成本；存貨成本包含在途的存貨成本以及等候運送的存貨成本，
在途的存貨成本取決於產品價值與運送時間等，而等候的存貨成本則決定於貨
運業者所提供之頻次；當運送頻次多，貨物等候時間短，其存貨成本小；相反
的，當頻次少時，貨物抵達運送起點後，無法馬上運送至迄點的機會變大，其
存貨成本就較大。因此貨運業者所提供之航班頻率多寡，將影響到貨主的等候
運送的存貨成本，進而影響貨主託運的運具選擇結果。產品價值也會影響在途
成本之大小，即使同一產業各貨品的產品價值仍有所不同，使得各廠商即使選
用相同運送方式、相等距離，其所感受之在途存貨成本亦有所不同。由於各產
品急迫性、時效性與本身價值相異，如生鮮花卉類具有時效性、電子產業較為
重視效率，因此生鮮產品與電機產品等在途成本較高，而紡織業之產品由於急
迫性低，使其產品在途存貨成本低。在相同距離下，以不同運具方式運送，所
需要之時間相異，一般而言，運送時間與處理產品時間較長時，所造成的在途
成本較高，但由於空運運費較高，因此當廠商對於非具有時效性之產品，可能
在衡量物流成本多寡之情形下，選擇以運費低頻次少的方式運送。同樣的，運
送之距離長短影響產品的在途時間，進而影響在途存貨成本之多寡。 
因此令運具 x 由起點 r 運送至迄點 s 之距離為 rsd 公里，廠商以運具 x 運送每

此本研究假設產品價值符合咖碼分配(gamma distribution)。令一產品每公斤產品

註. 此航空貨運業者在日本航線之頻次與單位基本費率以至日本大阪為例 
接下來即分別探討不考慮容量限制以及考慮容量下，各航線之市場佔有率，
主要以 2003 年為例。首先分析台北至香港航線，此航線距離較短，僅有 932 公
里，對於貨主而言，當運送時間較短，其存貨成本不如運送至美國航線那麼明顯，
比較容易著重於運輸費用部份，尤其當運送貨物量多時，總運輸成本較高，當產
品價格又不高時，一般貨主較不願意以高運費方式運送其低價位之貨品，因此貨
主選擇集中於運費較低的兩家航空貨運業者。 
 
 112
 紙業與化學橡膠業者由於單位產品價格低，存貨成本對於總運送成本影響更
小，在選擇運送方案時，更容易直接考量運費多寡決定航空貨運業者，然而 CI
與 BR 的單位費率差距不大，所以被選機率大約各相同。BR 部分以較小機型運
送貨品，集貨時間可能較短，因此其它產品價格較高的產業並考量存貨比之下，
例如生鮮產品或是電子產品大多選擇頻次最高的航空貨運業者運送產品。在了解
各產業選擇情形後，考量各產業在此一航線之出口比例，得以加總求算出此航線
各航空貨運業者的市場佔有率，因此雖然 BR 在紙業與化學業的市場佔有率較
低，但是這些產業的出口量少，而電子產業為台灣地區主要出口貨品，又偏好選
擇以高頻次的航空貨運業者，因此 BR 的被選機率約為 75%，如表 5.4 所示。 
各航空貨運業者所擁有的機隊大小有所限制，因此在衡量容量限制後，各家
航空貨運業者的市場佔有率如表 5.4 所示，由於主要三家貨運業者所提供之容量
相近，各家被選機率差異不大。對於 BR 而言，相較於不考慮容量的機率下滑許
多，由於 BR 的高頻次與低運費吸引許多顧客，致使 BR 業者在此航線其實具有
許多潛在貨運量，若欲擴大至香港的市場佔有率，可考慮增加容量，以較大機型
運送貨品，雖然集貨時間可能較久，但其潛在需求量大，且此航段距離短，對於
貨主而言所感受到的存貨成本較小，較著重於金錢因素，因此業者可藉由較低的
單位基本運費優勢，以增加此航線之市場佔有率。藉由表 5.4 之結果顯示，可看
出各家航空貨運公司在台北至香港航線運送貨品種類的結構比例，對於每一家航
空貨運公司而言，最主要的運送貨品皆為電子產品，大致上佔有比例呈現成長情
形。CI 航空貨運公司所運送的農產品、食品紡織、木製品與化學橡膠業的產品
比例愈來愈少，主要受到這些貨品在此航線的出口量降低的原因，機械業的出口
運量比例較為不穩定，而由 CI 所運送的電子產業之貨物由 2000 年占 18%至 2003
年增為 25%。BR 航空貨運公司同樣主要運送產品為電子產品，其次為機械業、
食品紡織產品；但農產品與食品的佔有比例愈來愈少。由於 CX 所提供的頻次較
多，對於高單位產品價格的貨品而言，能夠降低等候的存貨成本，因此 CX 所運
送的電子產品與機械產品比例較為穩定，但其他產品的運量則逐年減少。 
 114
因此無法成為貨主在運送貨品時的第一考量。在考量各產業之比例下，貨主較偏
好於選擇 BR 或其他航空貨運公司，如表 5.5 所示。另外藉由此表可發現，BR
受到航權限制與考量需求量的情形下，其所提供之容量較少，選擇機率下降許
多，若能在此航線爭取新的航權亦或增加航班數，或是改以較大的航機運送貨
品，得以增加其在台北至日本航線的市場佔有率。台北至日本航線對於台籍航空
公司而言並非主要市場，所安排的頻次較少；但是對於日籍航空公司而言，則規
劃較多的航班頻次，因此可明顯發現選擇機率較高。 
由於 CI 往日本東京的頻次少，隨著許多產業的單位產品價格提高，各產業
的佔有比例由 2000 年至 2003 年大多呈現減少的情形；而對於農產品在 2002 年
產品價格下降時，由於 CI 的費率低，吸引低產品價格的貨品。BR 航空貨運公司
往日本航線的運送貨品，主要為電子產品與農產品，隨著這兩種類別的貨品量逐
年增加，BR 藉由低運費的優勢，吸引了部份運量。EG 所提供的頻次高，吸引
許多高單位產品價值的貨品，因此電子產業為主要客源。對於具有時效性的生鮮
產品、農產品而言，其他航空貨運業者所提供的高頻次為重要選擇因素，因此其
他貨運公司在農產品的佔有比例為最高。 
因為台灣地區在 2002 加入 WTO，使農產品與食品業的平均單位產品價格
呈現逐年下滑趨勢；其他紙業、化學橡膠業、機械與電子產業的平均單位產品價
格逐年成長，再加上現今科技進步，業者講求效率之情形下，對於存貨成本愈來
愈重視。由圖 5.2 可發現，由於台北運送往日本地區農產品的貨運量增多(佔該航
線出口量的 33%~42%)，此類產品具有明顯時效性的特性，尤其在 2002 年平均
單位價值提高，貨主對於存貨成本的重視程度可能因此而提高許多，因此可以發
現在 2002 年頻次最高的航空貨運公司其選擇機率大幅成長；而後農產品的產品
價格下降，而 EG 與其餘航空貨運公司所提供的頻次差異不大，因此選擇機率開
始呈現較為相近的情形。另外，CI 與 BR 在日本航線所提供的頻次較少，所能服
務的容量也就較小，因此貨主選擇這兩家航空貨運公司機率偏低。

產業的貨品出口量愈來愈多，尤其受到許多高科技電子廠商外移，有愈來愈多的
貨品運送至香港與中國大陸地區，進行更進一步的生產等步驟。隨著高產品價格
在此航線逐年增多，由於 CI 所提供之服務屬性特性為低單位基本運費，雖然可
維持其市場佔有率在 25%以上，但是並沒有因為高價值產品增加，而提高貨主對
他們的偏好，各廠商可能因為產品價格逐年增加的情況下，對於頻次的重視程度
不斷提高，因此對於低運費的選擇機率只保持在一定的比例，而沒有增加。 
對台北至日本東京航線而言，可能因為航權受限，或是日本並非 CI 航空貨
運業者的主攻市場，所以在此航線所提供的每週航班頻次僅有兩班，造成在此航
線的市場佔有率較低，大約在 13%~18%之間，隨著具有顯著時效性，怕腐敗的
農產品運送至日本的比例逐年增加，使得 CI 在日本航線的市場佔有率略微呈現
下降趨勢。在安克拉治航線的主要出口貨物由圖所示，更可明顯看出電子產業的
比例逐年增加，且幾乎佔此航線的總貨運量，隨著單位產品價值升高，且高單位
產品價格的比例也不斷增加，讓提供高航班頻次的 CI 在此航線的市場佔有率甚
至在 2003 年高達將近 40%。在較短航線中，此航空貨運業者雖提供的頻次並非
最多，但是因為低廉的單位基本運費吸引了許多需求量；相反的，在長距離航線
上，此航空貨運業者雖然單位基本費率並非最低，但是藉著高頻次的特性，擄獲
許多貨主選擇該航空貨運業者運送貨品。 
 
圖 6.6 BR 在各航線之市場佔有率之比較 
圖 6.6 的折線圖部分同樣為 BR 航空貨運業者在各航線之市場佔有率。此航
空貨運業者在台北至香港航線，藉著低運費吸引客源，再加上其所提供的航班頻
次最多，而此航線最主要的出口貨物仍為電子產品，且比例有愈來愈多的走向，
 122
送達，此時就可能選擇低費率且低班次的航空貨運公司，以減少總運輸成本。 
藉由本研究所建構之需求模式，求算各年不同產業對於航空貨運業者的選擇
機率，也就是各航空貨運公司在不同航線上的市場佔有率，進而透過各產業的出
口貨運量，即可分析出各年航空貨運業者的航空貨運需求量；為配合供給需求模
式之案例分析，在此以 CI 航空貨運業者作為目標航空貨運公司，探討該航空貨
運業者在追求利潤最大化之情況下，各航線之單位基本費率以及航班頻次之決策
結果。在台北至香港(包含中國大陸地區)的台灣出口總貨運量明顯呈現逐年增
加，因此即使目標航空貨運業者可能因為其所提供之頻次偏少，使得質輕價高貨
品增加下，選擇目標航空貨運業者的機率略為下滑，但是在總運送貨運量仍為身
高的趨勢，尤其在 2002 年景氣逐漸好轉之情況下，目標航空貨運業者的貨品運
送量較前一年成長超過 30%。 
由表 6.4 至表 6.6 可知，各航空貨運業者於不同航線之市場佔有率各不相同，
且與其運量限制有很大的關係。當運量足夠時，長榮、華航在台北至香港、至日
本、至安哥拉治等航線市場佔有率較大。然實際上因為運量無法滿足市場需求
量，上述航空貨運業者的市場顯著減少。由於每週運量小，托運者必須再等待一
段較長時間等候下班航機，導致其物流成本增加，因此選擇航空貨運業者機率下
降。表 6.7 比較有無運量限制下，不同航線托運者之每公斤平均物流成本。

與 0.05 美元。運量充足為貨主節省之物流成本值於不同航線上表現不同的原因
在於該條航線貨主之組成、運送貨物價值分佈以及托運量。台北之香港航線之貨
主大多來自於機械與電子產業，所托運的貨物屬於高價值，這些貨主最適航空貨
運業者選擇多集中於一至兩家。運量限制導致這些貨主需承擔高額存貨成本和等
待時間。相反地，若航空貨運業者使用較大型的飛機，所增加的運量使得這些貨
主的需求得以滿足，可節省可觀的物流成本。另一方面，航線台北至日本的物流
成本節省值並不如上述兩條航線顯著，原因在於此條航線之出口量並不多，最適
航空貨運業者選擇受運量限制的影響不大。

 總述以上之結果，貨主在選擇航空貨運業者時，以其承擔之運輸成本與存貨
成本總和最小為準則。在台北至香港航段由於近年來貨運量不斷上升，因此存在
許多潛在需求量，而在該航線由於運送距離短，貨主所感受到的存貨成本較小，
貨運業者可考量增加頻次並以較大機型運送貨品，降低單位基本運費，以增加市
場佔有率。不論在任何一條航線上，單位產品價格較高的貨品，多偏向選擇頻次
高的運送方式，對於單位基本費率的考量則為其次。 
6.2 航空貨運網路設計模式 
上述研究著重於航空貨運航線市場之探討。在分析各起迄對之需求量後，本
研究進一步探討航空貨運公司在追求利潤最大化，以及考量供需互動關係之最適
基本費率、機型與航線頻次決策。本研究定位為長期規劃，因此不深入探討如何
訂價，僅著重於基本定價之決策，而基本費率係根據營運成本決定。在調整提供
之頻次後，會影響需求者的運具選擇決策，再次改變航空運輸需求量，進而供給
者須再次調整在各航線中，應提供的機型與班次多寡。 
航空業者在進行航班頻次與機型大小之規劃時，需要考量其實際營運的限
制，例如該航空業者擁有之機隊大小以及規劃的航班頻次所提供之運輸容量是否
足以因應各產業之航空貨運量。由於每架航機無法隨時隨地都可以運送貨品，因
此航空業者所擁有的機隊規模大小，影響各架航機每周所能飛行的頻次，在各航
線上必須規劃適足的航班頻次。另外，營運成本的多寡取決於飛行距離、不同機
型的營運成本、處理貨品成本以及容量利用率；因此營運成本與容量利用率也成
為航空業者規劃的重點之一，這些因素影響航空業者基本費率的訂定，也就關係
到貨運業者的利潤多寡。當利用率低時，每趟飛行所載運的貨物量較少，可能使
得收益不足以支付航機每次營運所需花費的基本成本，而導致虧本的情況。當頻
次少時，航空貨運業者可能會失去部分注重存貨成本的貨主；當頻次多時，可能
吸引更多的需求量，但是過多時，使得容量利用率低，也就發生上述虧損情形，
所以對於航空貨運業者而言，頻次與容量利用率之間的衡量成為重要議題。 
6.2.1 航線頻次關係 
航班頻次與航機容量利用率通常呈現反向關係，在機型不變且貨運量固定的

6.2.2 營運成本 
一般而言，航線的營運成本包含航空業者在進行運送服務時所需支付的各種
費用，例如航機營運成本以及機場使用費。航機的營運成本包括飛行成本，例如
油料成本、勤務人員費用等，飛機維修費用以及折舊費用等，通常和機型大小以
及飛行之距離相關；而機場使用費則包含起降費用、地勤場地設備使用費、停留
費以及安全服務費等，通常與航機大小以及重量有直接關係。 
本研究將航空貨運公司的營運成本包含兩部份，一部分為與機型相關的直接

利潤最大化之情況下，求算航空貨運業者最適之航班頻次與基本費率(式(6.21))。
當航空貨運業者在決定其最適頻次與費率後，可能與初始值有所差異，因而使得
貨主改變其決策，並影響到各航空貨運業者在各航線的市場佔有率。而其他競爭
航空貨運業者同樣以上述之供需互動模式，求算其市場佔有率、基本費率與頻
次。當供需互動模式達均衡時，其解即達到收斂；也就是說，當航空貨運業者所
提供之費率與頻次不會使貨主改變選擇時，航空貨運量不再改變，因此供給者不
會再調整其所提供之基本費率與頻次，以追求最大利潤，此時即為供需互動模式
達均衡。求解步驟說明如下： 
STEP 1. 預測各起迄對之各產業航空貨運量 lrsQ (式(4)-式(13))。將目標航空貨

維修成本與訓練人員等營運成本，因此在全貨機部份，僅有 B747-400F 單一種機
型，單架航機起飛的固定營運成本為美金 18,710 元，包含部分空運成本、場站
成本以及維修成本；變動成本為每公里 1.58 元美金，主要是燃油費用；而單位
處理成本則為每公斤 0.51 元美金。航空公司之公開說明書表示，運費部份的訂
定考量包括承載率以及需求量等因素；當航空貨運公司所期望的承載率較高時，
每單位重量貨品所需要承擔的營運成本較少，若此時需求量多，可使航空貨運公
司較容易達到預期的承載率，也可賺得較多的收益，加上此時的營運成本低，應
可獲取較高的利潤。 
在實務上，航空貨運業者預計銷售情況，主要參酌市場需求，並預估各航線
之承載率以及運費而定；因此在分析各起迄對之需求量後，本研究進一步探討航
空貨運公司在追求利潤最大化，以及考量供需互動關係之最適基本費率、機型與
航線頻次決策。在求得預測之年貨運量後，即可代入本研究供需互動之航班頻次
規劃模式；在經過三次循環後，供給與需求模式結果達到收歛，其結果如表 5.9
所示。 
經由供需互動之模式所求得目標航空貨運公司在台北至香港航線的貨運
量，由一年為 42,066,447 公斤增加至一年為 42,912,030 公斤，在台北至日本東京
航線則可使貨運需求量一年增加 2,796,695 公斤；在台北至安克拉治部份則因為
頻次減少之情況下，使目標航空貨運業者在此航線的市場佔有率略減 0.36%。由
於需求量改變的情況下，使目標航空貨運業者在航班頻次與單位基本費率，在追
求總利潤最大化的情形下而重新訂定；台北至香港航線由於需求量大增的情形
下，目標航空貨運業者每週的航班頻次應增加為每週 11 班；台北至日本航線增
加為每週 4 班，與實際情況其實相差不大；台北至安克拉治航線部分貨運量逐年
微幅下降，根據模式規劃之頻次應減為每週 31 班，美國地區仍為台灣地區主要
出口國之一，出口量約佔台灣地區將近一半，因此航空貨運業者為符合需求，在
此一航線的貨主對於存貨成本重視程度高，仍需要安排較多頻次於此航線。 
 134
北至安克拉治航線，雖然頻次降低，但是因為在此航線的貨主所較為重視的因素
是航班頻次與運送時間多寡，目標航空貨運公司則因為其所提供航班頻次較多的
優勢，即使稍微提高其單位基本運費，並不會因而失去太多的航空貨運量，仍可
維持其一定的市場佔有率，更可增加年總利潤。 
航空貨運業者在衡量主要市場後，可考慮積極爭取有利航權或加強聯航合
作，進而強化全球航網，增加市場佔有率。由表 5.9 之數據顯示，根據供需互動
之規劃模式，使得目標航空貨運業者在運往香港以及日本地區的市場佔有率增
加，分別提高為 32.38%與 20.47%，雖然在台北至安克拉治航線的市佔率微幅下
降，但僅減少不到 0.5%的需求量。另外可發現，供需互動之規劃模式確實可使
航空貨運業者的年總利潤增加，由原本的美金 41,147,703 元提高為 41,465,861 美
元，約增加 0.8%。 
表 6.11 需求是否為外生下頻次規劃之結果比較 
航線 供需互動下之頻次 需求為外生之頻次 
TPE-HKG 11 11 
TPE-NRT 4 4 
TPE-ANC 31 30 
   
利潤(US$/year) 41465861 41341036 
表 6.11 為需求是否為外生變數下之結果比較，在供需互動模式所決策之頻
次在台北至香港航線為每週 11 班，至日本為每週 4 班，而至安克拉治為每週 31
班；當需求視為外生之情形下，台北至香港與至日本航線的航班頻次並沒有改
變，但是在台北至安克拉治航線則減少為 30 班。可能由於至香港與至日本航線
的飛行距離短，對於貨主而言，頻次的多寡對於選擇結果影響較小，因此航空貨
運公司所提供的頻次只要足夠運送航空貨運需求量，台北至安克拉治在供需互動
下所規劃之航班頻次較多，由於經由供需互動下可發現，頻次的增加可能稍微吸
引部份需求量，得以提高利潤。結果顯示根據供需互動之模式所規劃之航班頻
次，使航空貨運業者的年利潤為 41,465,861 美元，相較於當需求視為外生時，其
利潤為 41,341,036 美元，確實可提升航空貨運業者之利潤。貨運業者可能受到航
權限制，而在台北至香港航線仍為規劃每週 6 班，若能爭取獲得有利航線之飛航
權利，渴望提高市場佔有率，進而使獲利增加。 
6.3 結果討論 
由於全球市場競爭激烈，愈來愈多的廠商期望能將貨品快速且安全送達目的
地，使得航空貨運業的重要性日益明顯。然而現今產業結構不斷改變，如台灣地
 136
廠商期望能快速送達目的地，因此在選擇運送方案時，較為著重於頻次與運
送時間因素部分。因此根據台北至安克拉治航線之結果顯示，當運送距離愈
長時，產品價值高的貨品偏好選擇以每週航班頻次多的航空貨運業者運送貨
品愈顯著。 
3. 在分析各航空貨運業者在不同航線上的各產業市場佔有率後，再考量各產業
的出口貨物量，進而加總各產業航空貨運需求量，即可預測出目標航空貨運
業者在各航線的貨運量。在台北至日本航線以及台北至美國安克拉治航空貨
運量成長較為穩定，根據本研究所構建之需求模式所預測之航空貨運量頗為
準確，僅台北至香港航線近年來發展快速，使在台北運送至香港與中國地區
之貨運量增加許多；同樣在波音公司所預測之亞洲地區航空貨運量平均年成
長率達 8%，存在許多潛在需求量。 
4. 本研究需求模式主要著重於以個體產業之選擇行為，再加總求算整體各航線
航空貨運量，以解釋各航線產業結構改變下，對於各航空貨運業者選擇情況
之變化，以更符合實際結果之預測。因此藉由與不考量各產業變化下，直接
將目標航空貨運業者的總航空貨運量，利用時間序列的灰色預測模式預測貨
運量。比較結果顯示，經由探討各產業選擇機率後，再加總預測之航空貨運
量較為準確，與實際航空貨運量的誤差較小。 
5. 透過供需互動之規劃模式，在台北至香港航線以及台北至日本航線的單位基
本運費以及航班頻次應略為增加，由於這兩航線之航空貨運需求量仍有成長
空間，可藉由提高頻次吸引更多的客源，而略微調漲基本費率可使利潤增加。
比較藉由供需互動模式之規劃下與將需求視為外生下之規劃結果，數值分析
結果顯示，透過供需互動模式所規劃之最適航班頻次與單位基本運費，確實
可使航空貨運業者的年利潤增加。 
本研究第三年期計畫首先分別構建需求模式以及供給模式，分析影響廠商
選擇航空運輸方式之因素與決策，在探討供需互動下，供給者之年利潤以及最適
基本費率與機型頻次等決策。經由本研究之結果與分析，可瞭解航空貨運業者所
提供之頻次與費率對於貨主選擇行為之影響，亦可瞭解不同航線上航空貨運市場
結構與量的變化，以及在考慮需求量之變化下，航空貨運業者所應規劃之最適航
班頻次與單位基本費率，以提供航空貨運業者預測、分析航空貨運市場的工具以
及營運決策的一個參考依據。 
 本研究整合貨主選擇模式與航空貨運業者基本費率與航線頻次規劃模式，分
析航空貨運市場，考量市場結構變化與全球分工改變之情況下，貨主在各航線上
對於各家航空貨運業者選擇行為等，探討前述因素對於航空貨運業者於中長期規
劃之影響，如何決策其單位基本費率以及班機頻次，作出下列之建議。然本研究
雖探討供需互動下航空貨運業者航路網規劃結果，但其中部分假設與分析仍有未
臻理想之處，茲列述如下，以作為後續研究之參考。

1. Introduction 
In the strategic supply chain network-planning phase, the problem generally 
involves deciding the configuration of the network that satisfies customer demand 
while minimizing manufacturers’ costs.  Though the use of large-scale capacity is 
encouraged due to there exist economies of scale following reduced costs, the 
advantage depends on the level of the market demand.  The benefit brought by 
operating large scale manufacturing plants shrinks and production costs increased 
dramatically when the market demand is insufficient to realize scale economies and 
the capacity utilization is low.  On the other hand, revenue loss arises when supply 
does not match with high market demand.  Strategic supply chain network is a key 
factor influencing efficient tactical operations, and therefore has a long lasting impact 
on the manufacturers.  The majority of supply chain network problems uses average 
estimated customer demand patterns for the manufacturers over planning years 
covering peak and off-peak periods.  Unfortunately, unexpected abnormal events 
occur and continue for a period time, which further influence customer demand and 
affect network performance.  The continued survival and effectiveness lie in 
manufacturers’ ability to respond promptly to environmental turbulence (Lloréns et al., 
2005).  Since the supply chain network design involves the commitment of meeting 
customer demand, how to design a flexible supply chain network by considering 
economies of scale and demand fluctuations is important.   
A crucial element of the planning activities is the efficient design of supply 
chains.  There is a large number of optimization based approaches have been 
proposed for the design of supply chain networks (e.g. Arntzen et al., 1995; 
Jayaraman and Pirkul, 2001; Cohen and Moon, 1991).  Others addressed the 
coordination of logistics operations and the design of effective production and 
distribution systems (e.g. Cohen and Lee, 1988; Vidal and Goetschalckx, 1997; 
 3
is important to propose adjustment method for the manufacturer so as to maintain 
overall global network design objectives.  To summarize, few studies have combined 
supply chain network modeling and economy theory to formulate integrated models, 
coping with production economies and demand fluctuations.   
Reliability engineering is a well-established area of engineering, which has been 
widely applied to software reliability, mechanical reliability, and transportation 
network reliability, etc (e.g. Billintion and Allan, 1983; Chen, 1999; 2002).  Hsu and 
Wen (2002) developed a reliability evaluation method for airline network design, 
evaluating reliability of initial proposed flight frequencies under normal/abnormal 
demand fluctuations.  In the paper, a priori adjustment of flight frequencies is also 
presented.  However, the high capital cost and customer demand heavily affect the 
revenue and performance of a high-tech product manufacturer.  There are few 
studies in the field of supply chain management paying attention to supply chain 
network design reliability.   
The basic input data when designing a supply chain network are the estimated 
demand for different markets.  Past literature relied on simple forecast techniques, 
such as simple moving average method and exponential smoothing method, to 
forecast demand, from operational perspectives (e.g. Xu et al., 2001; Xiaolong and 
Zhang, 2004).  However, uncertain socioeconomic conditions and short lift of 
high-tech products complicates demand forecasts for various markets.  This study 
employs GM(1, 1) time series model proposed by Deng (1985) to forecast customer 
demand pattern.  
In summary, this study develops a series models to investigate the supply chain 
design problems for high-tech product manufacturers in response to production 
economies scale and demand fluctuations.  An MIP models is first developed, to 
discover how economies of scale, customer demands and investment conditions of 
 5
demand, locations, determine the location, capacity and production amounts for all 
manufacturing plants, and the material/product flows from suppliers/manufacturing 
plants to manufacturing plants/customer in different areas, so as to satisfy customer 
demand and minimize average per-unit product cost, given by the sum of inbound, 
production and outbound costs.  Based on the above definition, the supply chain 
network design problem incorporates both the strategic level planning and tactical 
level decisions, in which scale economies and capacity utilization are 
comprehensively considered. 
2.1 Supply chain network design programming model 
Consider a supply chain network G(N, A), where N and A represent the set of 
nodes and the set of links, respectively, in a directed graph G.  Let k be the 
manufacturing echelon and kn  be a specific manufacturing plant operated by the 
manufacturer with production amount 
kn
f  and capacity 
kn
v , where 
kk nn
vf  , while 
(k-1) is the material supply echelon and 1kn  represents a specific qualified supplier, 
respectively.  And a specific customer can be denoted by sn  with demand snf .  In 
the present paper, all the quantities apply for 1 month.  Moreover, let kkw ,1  be the 
required material flows for producing one unit product.  The required material 
amount and production amount of a specific manufacturing plant can be expressed, 
respectively, as a function of the sum of the material flows from its active suppliers 
and a function of the sum of the product flows to its active customers, as follows:

1knV  
be the fixed cost of the manufacturer with material supplier 1kn , which is 
independent as to the procurement amount from supplier 1kn  and manufacturing 
plants served due to the cost is mainly the results of the manufacturer contracting with 
the supplier.  Then, the total fixed cost for the manufacturer can be formulated as:

their unit-material costs are high.  This study denotes 1k

plant must equal to the required material amount.  Eq. (10c) defines the relationship 
between the production amount and the product flows from the manufacturing plant to 
customers served.  Eq. (10d) constrains that the total production amount must meet 
total customer demand.  Eq. (10e) defines the capacity utilization.  Eq. (10f) 
constrains decision variables 
kn
v , k
s
n

n
nf  to be non-negative integers.  
Finally, Eqs. (10g) and (10h) constrain decision variables 1k
k

n  and ksnn  to be 
binary.  Furthermore, the optimal capacity utilization as well as production allocation 
among the manufacturing plants and the active material suppliers can also be obtained 
from the model. 
2.2 Reliability of proposed capacity for the manufacturing plants under demand 
fluctuations 
The discussions completed to date deal with supply chain network design 
problems, and demonstrate how economies of scale influences the optimal capacity 
and production allocation among the manufacturing plants.  This section further 
investigates how demand fluctuations from different markets as well as the period of 
time within demand fluctuations continue influence the production of the 
manufacturing plants and affect their performance.  The unreliability problem arises 
from the condition the proposed capacity cannot match customer demand due to 
seasonal variations and/or abnormal variations.  Customer demand shrinkage results 
in excess supply and increased production cost due to low capacity utilization.  On 
the other hand, demand expansion causes decreased production cost due to cost 
economies; however, customer service level downgrades, following revenue loss once 
proposed capacity cannot meet the excessive high demand.  Thus, the results of a 
supply chain network design, i.e., the proposed capacity and production allocation 
produces reliability for the manufacturer only when the demand fluctuates within

manufacturing plant kn  is defined as unreliable under demand fluctuations in month

probability that the capacity utilization falls between the acceptable limits, namely:

The impacts of fluctuating demand of customers on manufacturing plants’ 
production are further analyzed.  Let

manufacturing plant kn  to that from all plants, namely:

Suppose that, during the planning year, an abnormal state insw  occurs at time

benefits associated with adjustment decisions are first discussed.  Then, this study 
formulates a mathematical programming model for determining the optimal 
adjustment decisions in terms of production reallocations among all plants by

sum of allocation cost, extra material purchase cost, difference in production cost,

The allocation cost includes fixed allocation cost and variable allocation cost.  
The fixed allocation costs are those expenses associated with production schedule 
change costs, contract cost with outsourcing firms, etc and are incurred as long as the 
manufacturer determines an adjustment.  The variable allocation costs can be divided 
into two categories: outsourcing cost and compensation cost, where the former are

3.2 Customer demand shrinkage 
The potential production amount of the manufacturing plants is significantly 
reduced due to a decline in customer demand, resulting in production diseconomies.  
The production cost will be even higher if most of the manufacturing plants locate in 
regions with high commodity price indexes.  On the contrary to demand expansion, 
this study proposes a production adjustment strategy in response to demand shrinkage 
such that the production could be focused on few economical manufacturing plants, 
instead of dispersed production by all manufacturing plants.  This study further 
considers the costs associated with production adjustment and formulates a 
mathematical programming model for determining the optimal reallocation of 
production amount among the manufacturing plants by minimizing total adjustment

Though the production cost of a manufacturing plant with additional production 
amount can be correspondingly reduced, the production cost of the other plants is 
raised since there is less production to share the high capital cost.  The manufacturer 
should carefully investigate the difference in production cost for all manufacturing 
plants when it comes to production reallocation in response to demand shrinkage.

4. Case study 
A numerical example of T-company, which specializes in wafer foundry in the 
semiconductor industry and has its headquarter located in Taiwan, is provided to 
demonstrate the application of the proposed models.  Base values for the 
cost-function relevant parameters are given to resolve the problem of determining 
T-company’s supply chain network; however, some operating costs are unavailable, 
the annual report data in TSMC (2005) were employed to estimate them.  In this 
study, total customers are classified according to geographic distributions and the six 
major customers of T-company are North America, Europe, Japan, China and Taiwan.  
T-company could operate either 12-inch, 8-inch or 6-inch wafer fabrications (FABs) 
to serve customers, which produce average monthly capacities of 50000, 70000 and 
82000 pieces, respectively.  Note that each size of FAB can only produce its 
particular size of wafers, i.e. 12-inch, 8-inch and 6-inch wafers due to the complexity 
of technology in the manufacturing process of producing wafers.  And one piece of 
12-inch wafer is 2.25 times the size of that of 8-inch wafer; furthermore, it is 4 times 
of 6-inch wafer.  To unify, customer demand, capacity and production amount are 
measured in terms of pieces of 8-inch equivalent wafers.  Thus the capacities of 
12-inch, 8-inch and 6-inch FABs can be revised as 112500, 70000, 45920 pieces of 
8-inch eq. wafers.  Regarding manufacturing plants, there are five available locations 
for T-company to operate various sizes of FABs, namely, Taiwan (Hsinchu), Taiwan 
(Tainan), Shanghai, USA and Singapore.  The monthly capital cost for different-size 
FAB can be estimated by total expenses for the FAB construction and equipment set 
up and the maximum usage period of the FAB.  Tables 1 and 2 show, respectively, 
the forecast values for each of the 5 major customer demands in year 2007 and the

As shown in Table 3, T-company will operate six 12-inch FABs in the five 
locations, where there are two 12-inch FABs constructing and operating in Taiwan 
(Hsinchu) due to economical incentives provided by Taiwan government.  To meet 
the high demands, all FABs, other than the FAB in Singapore, reaches their 
full-capacity production.  Though the production amount could efficiently share the 
high capital cost of constructing a 12-inch FAB in Singapore, the higher production 
cost hinders the FAB from a 100% capacity utilization as compared to that in other 
locations.  Furthermore, the proportion of output from FAB in Singapore is merely 
0.125, while that of other FABs is 0.175.  The average production cost per 8-inch eq. 
wafer is US$ 322.85, which is lower than the average variable production cost of an 
8-inch wafer as listed in Table 1.  The result shows that the manufacturer can reduce 
the impact of employing a large-size capacity plant on the total costs, by determining 
a full-capacity production for that plant.  The results also imply that the wafer 
foundry production exhibits scale economies and a large-size capacity manufacturing

Due to the proposed full-capacity production of many FABs, the demand 
expansions occurring in China has led the FABs to low reliabilities, where the 
reliability values of FABs in different locations are diverse.  The acceptable 
utilization levels often reflect the expectations of T-company towards various FABs in 
different locations.  The probabilities of capacity utilizations fall within a narrow 
range of acceptable level will be small if there is a high minimal acceptable 
utilizations value.  The above reason explains why the two FABs in Taiwan (Hsinchu) 
exhibit the lowest reliabilities.  In addition to the range of acceptable utilization 
levels, the reliability value also depends on the production allocation among FABs in 
different location.  Since there exists surplus capacities of the FAB in Singapore, it 
maintains a good performance under these demand expansions.  Furthermore, the 
fluctuations of demands from customers in Japan, Taiwan, Europe and North America 
can be classified as normal by a comparison between the data in Tables 1 and 4.  
This study focuses on the unreliable situation arising from expansion demand from 
China and proposes an adjustment strategy by solving P2 (Eqs. 25(a)-25(g)).  
Suppose there are two available outsourcing firms in the market, which locate in 
Japan and Korea with limited outsourcing amounts.  The set of adjustment months, t, 
is t={4, 5, 6, 7}, totaling 4 months.  Table 6 lists the initial values of parameters in 
P2.  Table 7 shows the results and the optimal objective function values with and 
without network adjustments.

Definition Initial values

Table 7 shows the expected production amounts of most FABs exceed their 
capacities, which are unattainable.  In this circumstance, T-company could operate 
the FABs as initially proposed and bears a huge revenue loss being US$ 39936000 in 
a case of no adjustment, as listed in Table 7.  T-company could also alter and 
increase the production amount of a reliable FAB and further consider an outsourcing 
in order to fulfill the high demands.  Table 7 shows performing an adjustment yields 
a reduction in total production cost which offsets the derivative additional costs, such 
as allocation costs, extra material purchase costs and transportation costs, etc.  
Furthermore, T-company can avoid the high penalty cost if the adjustment is made.  
The benefits are increased if the unit-product penalty cost is high.  However, there 
are still unfilled demands due to limited outsourcing amounts, remaining a penalty 
cost.  By comparing between total costs with and without an adjustment, the 
production adjustments are shown to benefit T-company.  In this case study, 
T-company gains a high profit margin on wafer foundry; consequently, it will suffer a 
great loss if the market price of the product is high and the adjustment is not made.  
On the other hand, the outsourcing cost is paid to the outsourcing firms, which 
includes not only the production, material purchase costs bore by the outsourcing firm, 
but also a premium charged.  This study further performs sensitivity analysis to 
investigate whether or not performing an adjustment under various unit-product 
penalty costs and outsourcing costs.  Let mo  be the average unit-product 
outsourcing cost and P  be the unit-product penalty cost, respectively.  Thus, 
P
om
  
reflects the difference between the outsourcing and penalty cost.  A large value of 
P
om
  indicates an increased outsourcing cost as compared with the penalty cost, which 
represents the situations of product being less value or a large premium charged by 
outsourcing firms.  Figure 1 shows the threshold of adjust/do-nothing judgments by 
 31
even though the payment is expensive, as shown in Figure 1.   
In this study, the fixed allocation cost includes production schedule change costs 
of the manufacturing plants, contract cost with outsourcing firms, which also reflects 
the difficulty in searching qualified outsourcing firms.  The fixed allocation cost will 
be extremely high if there are few available and qualified outsourcing firms, at which 
the disadvantage may outweigh the advantage of the adjustment.  Furthermore, the 
total adjustment benefits during the execution of an adjustment depend on not only 
the considerable amounts of abnormal demand but also the duration of the abnormal 
months.  An increased duration of abnormal months will accumulate lots of savings 
in production costs and avoidable penalty costs during the execution of an adjustment 
and thereby an adjustment is suggested.  The advantage is diminished if the fixed 
allocation cost is high combined with a short abnormal period.  This study further 
examines whether or not to perform an adjustment under variations in fixed allocation 
costs and duration of abnormal months.  Figure 2 shows the threshold of 
adjust/do-nothing judgments by comparing between different durations of abnormal 
months and fixed allocation costs, where the left-hand and right-hand sides of the 
solid line represent, respectively, do nothing and adjust judgments.

shrinkage in North America, is considered in the case study.  Suppose a sudden 
declined demand from customers in North America due to a finance crisis occur from 
January to March.  The data concerning this abnormal state, including duration, 
abnormal demand distributions and duration probabilities, are listed in Table 8.  The 
expected demand distribution from the abnormal location, North America, is 
calculated and shown in Table 8.  The reliabilities of the FABs in different locations, 
considering demand shrinkage, are calculated using Eq. (17), and the resulting 
reliability values are listed in Table 9.

We can expect a fall in production amount of all FABs in different locations with 
demand shrinkage, as shown in Table 11, yielding a low capacity utilization and thus 
high production cost.  To avoid the high production cost, an adjustment is considered.  
As shown in Table 11, the adjusted production amounts of the FABs in Taiwan 
(Hsinchu), Taiwan (Tainan) and Shanghai reach full-capacity production, where these 
three locations are featured with low capital and variable production costs.  And the 
total production cost of these FABs can be effectively reduced.  Though there is an 
idle FAB locating in Singapore, yielding in a high idle capital cost, savings in total 
production costs still exists, i.e. US$ 50647545, implying the effects of an idle FAB 
 37
of an abnormal state and the related allocation costs influence the decision on whether 
or not performing an adjustment.   
This study demonstrates the application of the models by using T-company as an 
example, which specializes in wafer foundry in semiconductor industry.  The result 
shows that the manufacturer can reduce the impact of employing a large-size capacity 
plant on the total costs, by realizing economies of scale and determining a 
full-capacity production for that plant.  The results show that when severe demand 
fluctuations occur, the performance of different manufacturing plants depends on 
production allocation among and various expectations towards these plants.  A 
full-capacity production plant combined with high expectation often follows a low 
reliability value under a demand expansion, while other plants with surplus capacities 
maintain a good performance.  In the case, the manufacturer could consider a 
production allocation adjustment.   
The results show that performing an adjustment in response to demand 
expansions benefits the manufacturers in way that total production cost can be 
reduced and revenue loss is avoided, which outweigh the derivate additional costs.  
The results also suggest the manufacturers to stick by the initial proposed decisions 
and neglect the abnormal demand if the product value is low combined with high 
extra allocation cost.  On the other hand, it is worth performing an adjustment and 
continuing to outsource for a high value-added product, even though the payment is 
pricey.  Furthermore, the threshold of an adjustment is increased with an increasing 
duration of abnormal months, meaning a high fixed allocation cost will not prevent 
the manufacturer from performing an adjustment if the abnormal state lasts for a long 
period.  The results also imply the manufacturer could neglect an abnormal state 
with a short period, because the accumulated benefits during this short period might 
not compensate the high allocation costs.  The results show that severe demand

enhancing the service level. This study provides useful suggestions about operation 
strategies to logistic carriers for distributing temperature-controlled food. 
KEY WORDS : Perishable goods delivery; Multi-temperature; Joint distribution; 
Demand-supply interaction 
 
1. Introduction  
In light of high-quality fresh food demand, transportation demand for fresh food 
delivery has been continuously increased in urban area. How to jointly deliver food 
with different temperature-controlled requirements becomes an important issue for 
urban logistic carriers who provide both low temperature-controlled food and normal 
merchandise carrying services. This study aims to formulate a mathematical 
programming model to solve the optimal delivery cycle and service charge for 
multi-temperature distribution carriers. Compared with normal goods, perishable 
goods like fresh food need more strictly temperature control and less travel time in the 
shipping process due to characteristics such as short shelf life, quality decay with time 
and temperature changing. Once temperature-sensitive food contacts outside 
atmosphere due to door opening, the temperature inside the vehicle would be changed 
and the bacteria grow fast. For this reason, Industrial Technology Research Institute of 
Taiwan has developed a multi-temperature delivery system to distribute food of 
different temperature-layers in the same vehicle, which enable carriers to ship a 
 4 
sell fresh food to customers in the city, so food delivery time and shipping charge for 
each temperature-layer would influence their profits and their willing to consign in the 
future. The costs considered in the supply side in this study include transportation cost, 
inventory cost, penalty cost to compensate delivery delay, and energy cost to keep 
temperature.  In the demand side, the study considers shippers’ concerns such as 
food delivering within their time-windows, which are the time slots shippers request 
the food to be delivered, and ensure there is enough released time and profit of selling 
the food. Furthermore, the study explores demand-supply interaction and constructs a 
mathematical programming model to determine the optimal delivery cycles and 
service charges for jointly distributing multi-temperature food by maximizing the total 
profit of the carrier. 
Major subjects related to multi-temperature joint distribution include supply chain 
for perishable goods and its delivery strategy to customers. The issues of the fresh 
food transit process contain inventory, decay rate, package, routing and operational 
strategies. For research related to perishable inventory, Ghare and Schrade (1963) 
formulated a nonlinear model to solve the inventory problem for fresh food by 
assuming the decay rate as a constant. Covert and Philip (1973) extended Ghare and 
Schrade’s model but set the decay rate as Weibull distribution to construct an 
economic order quantity (EOQ) model, which became the foundation of follow-up 
 6 
 In addition to inventory and distribution network, there have been many studies 
focused on the phenomenon of quality and shelf life decayed with time in recent years. 
Bogataj et al. (2005) analyzed the importance to assure the stability of cold chains in 
the cold chains management (CCM), indicated what conditions should be fulfilled to 
assure that after robust perturbations of time delays, the behavior of the logistics chain 
would still be within the prescribed limits. Likar et al. (2006) analyzed the survey 
related to the situation of cold chain maintaining in food trade in Ljubljana based 
upon two hypotheses that a cold chain is interrupted in retail and the handling of food 
in retail varies. The results confirmed both of the hypotheses that in most of the cases, 
the temperatures measured differed from the required ones and the biggest differences 
were detected between temperatures indicated on cooling appliances and temperatures 
measured by calibrated thermometers. The findings have shown that conditions 
during food storage and in retail stores were not documented; there was no system to 
control the cold chain; and retailers were not familiar with the importance of 
maintaining a cold chain. Elliott and Halbert (2005) aimed to demonstrate satisfactory 
inter-UK transit of cold storage clinical trial material. The results showed that a 
modified four frozen gel pack configuration was suitable for summer transit; thus cold 
shipment verification was successfully carried out for a small-scale distribution 
operation. It was proven that refrigerated shipping conditions could be maintained 
 8 
2. Model 
For carriers in supply side, the costs considered for multi-temperature logistics in 
this study are inventory cost, penalty cost, transportation cost and energy cost. 
Inventory costs are time cost and storage cost for food in distribution center. Penalty 
cost exists when the delivery time-window is violated, transportation cost is related to 
vehicles usage and operating; and energy cost is spent for controlling food 
temperature in the transit process. The purpose of the model in this study is to find the 
optimal delivery cycle and service charge for each temperature-layer food by 
maximizing the profit of the carrier. 
This study assumes delivery cycles for different rˆ  temperature-layer food to be 
the demarcations of period segments, and divides the entire study period into m  
segments, which are the delivery cycles in this study. Before calculating the costs of 
carriers, the dispatching time for each food i  ordered by retailer j  at time t , tsijy , 
should be decided, and the food can only be dispatched at the beginning time for one 
of the delivery cycles. The model would decide the optimal dispatching cycle and 
which temperature-layers food should be dispatched at each cycle. If the distribution 
center dispatches food belong to temperature layer r  at the c th delivery cycle, CT , 
then 1=rCd ; otherwise, 0=rCd , where rrmC ˆ...1,...1 == ; i.e., CrCtsij Tdy =  with 
specific r , C . The dispatching time for each batch of food also depends on its

and temperature control while waiting for dispatching in the distribution center. For 
the time of stocking, assume each kind of food has its own stocking time; therefore, 
the beginning time for inventory cost calculation is the nearest stocking time of the 
food. Let tfijy  denotes the time that food i  ordered by retailer j  at time t  arrives 
at distribution center, iβ  represents the inventory cost of food i  per unit time, 
which contains cost for storage and temperature control, where the storage cost 
depends on the volume of the food, and cost for temperature control depends on both 
volume and the temperature layer the food belongs to. Hence, the inventory cost can 
be formulated as:

2.2 Penalty cost 
Nowadays, the service alternatives provided by carriers in the real world include 
delivering without the restriction of time-window, delivering within time-window on 
the same day of ordering, and delivering within time-window on the next day of 
ordering. Because food considered in this study is perishable, the study ignores the 
alternative of delivering without time-windows and assumes the carrier only provides 
the service of delivering within the time-window on the same day and the next day of 
ordering, respectively. On the other hand, due to the instable traffic condition in urban 
area, hard time-windows for delivery would not be realistic; on the contrary, carriers 
 12 
those delivery beyond the bound of the time-window [ ]tijtij su , , retailers also set the 
earliest acceptable time, tijU , for early arrival and the latest acceptable time, 
t
ijS , for 
late arrival; i.e. retailers consign their food in the future only when the delivery time 
within [ ]tijtij SU , ; otherwise, the orders would be canceled in the future. 
 The total vehicle routing distance for one-to-many distribution network can be 
estimated by continuous approximation (Daganzo, 1999; Hsu et al., 2007). This study 
calculates total vehicle travel distance and travel time, CT , using continuous 
approximation by Daganzo(1999). Assume the distribution center serves N  
customers, and the average demand amount of each retailers at period C  is CD ; σ  
represents the number of customers per unit area, i.e., σ  represents the demand 
point density;  CL  denotes the average load in a vehicle at period C , thereby the 
average number of retailers served by the same vehicle at period C , CN , can be 
calculated as

Metric. Let the average velocity of the vehicles be ζ , then CT , which can be

The loading/uploading cost in this study is dependent on the number of cold boxes 
and cold cabinets used for delivery. Let CrN τ , CrN Γ  denote the number of cold boxes 
and cold cabinets used for temperature-layer r  food at period C , respectively; 
τδ  
and Γδ represents the loading/uploading cost for a cold box and for a cabinet, 
respectively, then the loading/uploading cost at period C  can be expressed as 
ΓΓ+ rtrt NN δδ ττ . The numbers of cold boxes and cold cabinets are not only dependent 
on the total amount of food but also dependent on the capacity utilizations, which is 
affected by the volume, shape or some characteristics (e.g. breakable) of the food. To 
simplify the model, this study assumes all of food is packed as rectangular and not 
consider other factors affecting capacity utilization, i.e. capacity utilizations for all 
containers are taken into account as constants. Let τα , Γα  denote the capacity 
utilizations of cold boxes and cold cabinets, respectively, then, the constraint related 
to cold boxes and cabinets can be constructed as

carrier, i.e. etpi CCCCTC +++= ; where rp  is the service charge per unit volume 
for layer r . In this study, the service charge for each temperature-layer can be 
classified into two tiers: delivery within the time-window on the same day or on the 
next day of ordering. Because this study focuses on the distribution system in a 
metropolitan, retailers are distributed uniformly in the urban area, and the distances 
from the distribution center to retailers are not different significantly from retailer to 
retailer. Therefore, we assume that the service charge for any temperature-layers is not 
related to travel distance but only related to the temperature-layer. Let 1wrp  and 2wrp  
denote service charges for layer r  food delivered with time-window on the same day 
and the next day of ordering, respectively. Without considering the competition 
between carriers, the lower bounds of service charges can be determined only by the 
cost of delivering the food. Therefore, the constraint related to the charges can be 
constructed as

 Furthermore, this study generalizes the delivery cycles for multi-temperature 
delivery system as a decision matrix, M ,  
 20 
days, is shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1, the demand time is approximately estimated 
as the middle of time-window, and the figure also shows that there are different peaks 
for different layers. The parameters regarding temperature controlling equipments are 
collected and estimated as Table 2. Because the goods consigned in the case are all 
food, the retailers are most restaurants or retail stores which provide convenience food, 
and the demand peak for most layers appear before lunch and dinner time. For the 
differences between five layers, layer 3 has the most demand amount because this 
layer contains the majority of perishable food in the example; the demand of layer 1, 
which only contains sashimi, is most centralized due to its shortest shelf life cycle and 
the reason that it is affected by temperature much more than other food. For other 
parameters related to the distribution center, the fixed cost per vehicle is 500NT$, the 
variable cost is 0.8 NT$/km, the capacity per vehicle is 2000L. The service area of the 
distribution center is 1000 square kilometers; the expected distance between 
distribution center and retailers is 16 kilometers and the average speed of vehicles is 
50 kilometers per hour, with lead time of one hour before dispatching; and the times 
to dispatch are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, clocks on the first day of the study period, and the 
same times on the second day, which are denoted as 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48.

In order to calculate the upper and lower bounds of acceptable service charge for 
each temperature-layer, the study collect all data related to released time, expected 
profit and other costs for all of retailers. To maximize the profit, the carrier should 
choose the upper bounds of acceptable shipping charges to be the optimal scheme. For 
the different tiers of delivery service, i.e., delivery within time-window on the same 
day or the next day of ordering, this study assumes the charges for the latter is 0.8 
times the former, the results are shown as Table 3. This study does not consider the 
competition between carriers, for this reason, the charges in Table 3 may be a little 
higher than service charges in the real world. With the optimal service charges, the 
optimal delivery cycle for each temperature-layer can be solved and shown as the 
decision matrix in Table 4. The revenue for each layer in each period using the

 For the structure of the total cost with the optimal strategy in Table 5, among all, 
transportation cost is the largest part, which accounts for 39% of the total cost and 
follows by the inventory cost (32%) and energy cost (29%). Among the transportation 
cost, the variable cost, which depends on routing distance and oil price, take the most 
percentage, therefore, the carrier should decide the delivery cycles and the location of 
the distribution center carefully so as to reduce transportation cost and maintain 
service level at the same time. If the total routing distance can be decreased, not only 
the transportation cost can be reduced, but the energy cost for controlling temperature 
in transit process can be saved alike. Notably, the delivery cycles of multi-temperature 
joint distribution are the key factors affecting both routing distance and total cost, 
which further markedly influence the profit of carrier.

The goods consigned in this study are perishable food which is sold by the 
retailers to residents in urban area. For the definition of urban area, especially for its 
scale and density of population, there are quite different from country to country. 
Therefore, this study further performs sensitivity analyses regarding the demand point 
density, i.e., the density of retailers in the city, to discuss its effects. The results of 
sensitivity analyses are shown in Figure 3. The figure shows that the changes in profit 
and costs as demand point density increases but total shipping amount maintains the 
same. The figure also shows that the costs which are not related to vehicle travel 
distance directly, such as inventory cost, loading/uploading cost and fixed 
 28 
Table 7 shows the profit, costs and equipments needed for two conditions; in the 
first condition, the demand patterns for all layers are different, each layer has its own 
delivery demand peak and the dispatched amount are dispersed in many periods, as 
shown in Figure 4 (a). In such a condition, the results show that the amounts of 
vehicles and equipment needed in dispatching periods are similar. On the contrary, all 
temperature-layers have the same delivery demand patterns in the second condition 
shown in Figure 4 (b), while the shipping amounts are massed at a few periods. And 
the results show that amounts of vehicles, cold boxes and cabinets in such few periods 
are much larger than other periods, therefore, the carrier has to prepare more vehicles 
and equipments for these few periods. However, these vehicles and equipments would 
be idle in most other periods. For this reason, the carriers should analyze the 
difference of time-dependent characteristics between layers and find out the delivery 
demand peak period for each temperature-layer before planning operation strategies. 
If the peak periods are similar for most layers, the considerable large dispatched 
amount at these periods would make the equipments usage much different from 
period to period, in such condition, the carrier might consider setting an upper bound 
for total dispatched amount for each period and refusing the exceeded consignment.

4 Conclusions 
Recent studies related to temperature-controlled food logistics are most on the 
food quality decay issue due to temperature changing in the cold chain; this study 
aims to formulate a mathematical programming model to solve the optimal delivery 
 32 
This study can be extended in several ways, in the demand side, this study focuses 
on urban areas, which are distributed with fresh food retailers uniformly; future 
studies may discuss regions featured with urban and rural areas alike. In the supply 
side, this study does not consider the competition between carriers, but such 
competition would affect the service charge and shipping amount for each 
temperature-layer; future study may take it into account and analyze the results more 
deeply.

ABSTRACT 
Dynamic information that provides travelers with timely and useful information 
about transit travel service and surrounding socioeconomic activities may increase 
traveler’s awareness of available activity and transit service. Most of past research 
about investigating individual travelers’ behavior with dynamic information provision 
focused on travel aspects and seldom investigated the activities at terminal 
surroundings. The objective of the study is to examine the impacts of dynamic 
information provision on travelers’ travel behavior and the induced demand for 
terminal surrounding activity. The study demonstrates the importance of considering 
the activity and travel decisions for better understanding of the nature and magnitude 
of the impacts of dynamic information on activity participation and trip making 
behavior. Nested logit model was employed to identify important factors affecting 
travelers’ decisions on travel and induced demand for terminal surrounding activity; 
results indicated that activity time, travel time, travel cost, schedule delay and 
adopting dynamic information can significantly influence travelers’ travel and activity 
decisions. Consequently, the results of the developed models may provide basis on 
understanding travelers’ travel and activity decisions in using public transportation 
due to dynamic information provision.  
KEYWORDS: travel and activity decision; dynamic information 
1. Introduction 
Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have experienced a rapid growth in the 
past decade, as an alternative to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance the 
performance of transportation systems. Two submodels of ITS, advanced traveler 
information services (ATIS) and advanced public transportation system (ATMS) 
provide real-time and dynamic information for travelers. In addition to traffic 
conditions and public transit real timetable, travelers are also informed of social and 
entertainment activities in the surrounding areas. With telematics and dynamic 
information technology development, how to use advanced technology to improve 
public transportation services has become an important issue in many countries.   
The differences between scheduled and real timetable determine the reliability of

focused on departure time choice as the dominant response to traffic information. 
Their model was constructed based on expected utility theory, and included variations 
in travel time, the quality of travel time information and the travelers’ perception of 
travel time. However, the derived activities and the trade off relationships between 
transportation and activity decisions are seldom investigated in information-use 
related studies.   
Travels are derived demands for individuals to participate in a variety of 
activities. Activity-based travel analysis approaches have received attention in recent 
years as a potential replacement for trip-based approaches. The studies have analyzed 
travel from a theoretical perspective, taking into account of the demand for activity 
participation, interrelationships among trips. Recent travel behavior research has 
pointed out that a thorough knowledge of the causal mechanisms underlying people’s 
activity participation behavior may help enhance the forecasting capabilities of travel 
demand models. Activity participation is a key issue in activity-based travel behavior 
research (Bhat and Koppelman, 1999; Arentze and Timmermans, 2000). However, 
few studies pay attention to investigate the relationship between travel and activity 
decisions in considerations of dynamic information provision. 
In this study, in addition to the information related to traffic conditions, activity 
information such as socioeconomic and business information around the terminal is 
considered. The objective of the study is to examine the impacts of dynamic 
information provision on travelers’ travel behavior and the induced demand for 
terminal surrounding activity. The study demonstrates the importance of considering 
the activity and travel decisions for better understanding of the nature and magnitude 
of the impacts of dynamic information on activity participation and trip making 
behavior. The stated preference technique is employed to investigate travelers’ travel 
and activity choices under dynamic information provision. Morevoer, a nested logit 
model is employed to identify important factors influencing travelers’ decisions on 
transit departure time and mode choice and whether to participate in terminal 
surrounding activities.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The methodological 
framework is presented in Section 2. The results of an empirical study, which describe 
data collection and the interpretation of model estimations, are discussed in Section 3. 
Finally, Section 4 presents a summary of study findings and conclusions. 
2. Methodological Framework 
The study aims to evaluate changes in travel and activity behaviors in response to 
the provision of dynamic traffic and activity information. Stated preference surveys 
are used to design questionnaires, and to investigate travelers’ preferences by 
 5
with later departure time. On the other hand, travelers who decide not to participate in 
such additional activities are likely to either change their mode decision or departure 
time to leave earlier. For example, travelers with an urgent trip prefer to change 
departure time and depart terminal at an earlier time in order to increase more time for 
participating in destination activities. In this study, there are six alternative decisions 
for travelers including: (1) With induced activity, original mode and departure time; (2) 
With induced activity, later departure time of original mode; (3) With induced activity, 
alternative mode; (4) Without induced activity, original mode and departure time; (5) 
Without induced activity, earlier departure time of original mode; and (6) Without 
induced activity, alternative mode.  
Transit schedule delay and activity duration time are two important factors, 
which travelers consider in choosing travel and activity options. Small (1982) 
introduced the schedule delay variable to measure the difference between traveler’s 
actual arrival time and preferred arrival time at destination. In his study, schedule 
delay can be referred to either early arrival or late arrival based on the scheduled 
arrival time.  Under dynamic information provision, travelers depart at a later time 
due to an increased time for participating in terminal surrounding activities may result 
in late arrival at the destination. On the other hand, an increased time for participating 
in destination activities exists only if travelers depart for the destination at an earlier 
time or change the mode decision to a faster vehicle.  
Let Y denote time duration from passengers’ arrival at the terminal to their 
departure from the terminal. When travelers decide not to participate in additional 
activities, time duration Y refers to travelers’ waiting time at the terminal.  Assume 
travelers use X portion of the waiting time to participate in the terminal surrounding 
activity, then such activity time will be XY and waiting time will be reduced to (1-X)Y. 
Activity time XY  is also equivalent to the saving of original waiting time. In the 
study, the value of X ranges from 50 percent to 75 percent according to the test in 
pilot surveys. For the sake of simplification, X is assumed to be 50%, 60% and 75% in 
the stated preference experiment. Moreover, the levels of the schedule delay time for 
alternatives with induced activity are assumed as being late for one, two and three 
headways as compared to the original departure time.  For alternatives without 
induced activities, the levels of schedule delay time are assumed to be early for one, 
two and three headways. The descriptions of alternatives are shown in Table 1.

1985; Train 2003). The error terms of alternatives within a nest are correlated with 
each other, and the error terms of alternatives in different nests are uncorrelated. The 
NL model is a widely used form of the discrete choice model and has been 
extensively presented and described in the literature (e.g., Ben-Akiva and Lerman 
1985; Train 1986; Ortuzar and Willumsen 1994; Hensher and Green, 2002).  The 
study applies the nested logit analysis to investigate the relationship between 
travelers’ activity and travel decisions and important attributes under the provision of 
dynamic travel and activity information. Figure 1 illustrates a nested structure with 
induced demand for terminal surrounding activity choice at the upper level and 
alternative mode and/or departure time choices at the lower level.

The questionnaire survey was targeted at intercity travelers who used public 
transit from Taipei city to Taichung city in Taiwan. The data were collected by 
face-to-face interviews at Taipei Main Railway Terminals. The survey was conducted 
for four weeks in September 2006. A total of 360 completed questionnaires were 
collected. After eliminating incomplete questionnaires, 324 complete questionnaires 
remained. Each respondent was randomly assigned 2 alternatives from all alternatives 
in the choice set. The basic socioeconomic characteristics of respondents in the survey 
are presented in Table 2.

with the highest coefficient of adopting dynamic activity information. The results 
imply that engaging in additional activities make travelers adjust their scheduled and 
original travel decisions.  
In addition to trip and activity attributes, two socioeconomic characteristics, i.e. 
personal income and gender are considered in the model. The dummy variable for 
male travelers, which is included in the alternative 1, with induced activity, original 
mode and departure time, significantly yields a positive sign. The results imply that 
when adopting dynamic activity information, male travelers are more likely to 
preserve their original departure time and mode choice decisions and make use of 
waiting time effectively to participate in surrounding activities. The variable of 
personal income is incorporated in alternative 3, i.e. with induced activity, alternative 
mode.  The positive coefficient of the personal income variable indicates that 
travelers with high income are more likely to change mode decisions than those with 
low income.  Due to high income travelers are less sensitive to higher travel cost, the 
results imply that these travelers shift to faster higher-price mode so as to save travel 
time for participating in induced activity. 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, in addition to the information related to traffic conditions, activity 
information such as socioeconomic and business information around the terminal is 
considered. Travelers may use their waiting time more productively by participating 
in available activities, and/or choosing an alternative mode of transportation. 
Moreover, travelers with dynamic information on their travel-activity process are 
possible to change their prescheduled activities as well as transportation decisions 
during the travel-activity process. The objective of the study is to examine the impacts 
of dynamic information provision on travelers’ travel behavior and the induced 
demand for terminal surrounding activity. The study applies the nested logit analysis 
to investigate the relationship between travelers’ activity and travel decisions and 
important attributes under the provision of dynamic travel and activity information.  
The results show that an increased activity time leads to an increased utility and 
attracts more travelers to engage in induced surrounding activities with an increased 
duration. The results further show that there exist different and opposite influences of 
increased and decreased time for destination activity on travelers’ choice.  The 
decreased time for destination activity impacts more on travelers’ choice than the 
increased time does. The result implies that travelers emphasize more on late arrival 
than on early arrival at the destination. The positive sign of the parameter of increased 
time for destination activity variable implies that the dynamic information could help 
travelers develop more efficient travel decisions on increasing time spent on

A Model for Operational Planning for Multi-Temperature Joint 
Distribution System 
Chaug-Ing Hsu and Kang-Po Liu 
Abstract 
 
New technologies, such as the replaceable cold accumulation and insulation box of 
multi-temperature joint distribution technique, provide precise temperature control to 
reduce the negative influence of exposure on cargo quality and protect against 
undesirable environmental effects. The study includes these technologies and 
constructs a binary integer programming model to determine the multi-temperature 
logistics techniques and cargo handling quantities for terminals in a hierarchical hub 
and spoke network by minimizing terminal transportation and cargo-handling costs. 
This is accomplished through minimizing total delivery cost comprised of terminal 
transportation, cargo-handling and vehicle transportation costs.  Vehicle 
transportation cost is solved by a derived algorithm to search the appropriate 
technique(s) for each terminal and vehicle routing operations according to the Branch 
& Bound method under “the best, the first search” principle. The result indicates 
replaceable cold accumulation and insulation box of multi-temperature joint 
distribution technique is suitable for the terminals with a small shipping volume, 
dense distribution of terminals, and small size of the operation network and the 
operation network where demand is not even in the temporal or/and spatial 
distribution. 
Keywords: Multi-temperature joint distribution, Binary integer programming model, 
Hierarchical hub and spoke network 
 
I. Introduction 
 
In this study, multi-temperature logistics is defined as all processes of cargoes from 
production or supply, via warehousing, storage, distribution, being performed with 
 3
multi-temperature joint distribution technique, the refrigerated cold accumulation and 
insulating cabinet multi-temperature joint distribution technique, and the replaceable 
cold accumulation and insulation box multi-temperature joint distribution technique. 
Four techniques are introduced, respectively, as follows. 
 
a. Traditional multi-vehicle distribution technique 
 
This kind of distribution technique belongs to the single-temperature distribution 
method and is the typical conventional distribution method by which products are 
delivered in accordance with their suitable temperature ranges using regular, 
refrigerated, and frozen vehicles, respectively. Frozen, refrigerated, and regular 
warehouses must be set up in terminals to store cargoes temporarily. Consequently, 
the facilities for storing and shipping different temperature cargoes are not for 
common use and cannot share their capacities, which results in a low flexibility and 
capacity utilization. Refrigerated and frozen vehicles maintain the required 
temperature by a mechanical compression refrigeration unit driven by an engine. 
However, temperature control and cargo quality are usually affected by the vehicle 
environment and the frequency and duration of vehicle door opening and can not be 
pricely tuned to the optimum temperature for cargo storing requirements.  Moreover, 
in terms of vehicle purchase cost, refrigerated and frozen vehicles are 1.5 times more 
costly than regular vehicles, and the refrigeration unit has an even shorter service 
lifetime than vehicles. Such a distribution method may not be suitable for the markets 
of delivering shipments with a variety of categories and small quantities due to it 
demands a lot of shipments with the same temperature range to fill up the full load of 
one refrigerated or frozen vehicle. 
 
Although the above multi-vehicle distribution technique requires a huge initial 
investment, it can provide larger capacities as compared to other distribution methods 
if it is used for providing the delivery service of large quantities. That is, it yields 
more apparent scale economies benefits. It also involves less labor, facilities, and time 
 5
 
c. Refrigerated cold accumulation and insulating cabinet multi-temperature joint 
distribution technique 
 
This distribution technique has been recently developed in Japan and is one of the 
multi-temperature joint distribution methods that integrate the refrigerator with a cold 
accumulating technique.  An electric-driven refrigerator unit and cold-accumulating 
coils inside a heat-insulated cabinet is installed to accumulate cold during operation in 
the terminal until the cold energy required for transportation is achieved.  The 
cabinet is then used in regular vehicles to deliver cargoes. The flexibility of using the 
compartment space of vehicles can be realized and cargo quality also prevent from 
being affected by vehicle conditions and the frequency of vehicle door opening.  
However, the refrigerator unit inside the cabinet is quite heavy and requires more time 
and laborers to handle, thereby reducing the vehicle compartment capacity utilization 
ratio and yielding high handling cost.  With regards to cargo-handling, it is more 
complicated than the two previous techniques.  A reinstallation process of cold 
accumulation is required and cargoes need to be loaded inside the heat-insulated 
cabinet during transit and unloading after arrival at each terminal, thereby incurring a 
large amount of cargo-handling costs. Furthermore, its benefit due to scale economy 
is not apparent. 
 
d. Replaceable cold accumulation and insulation box multi-temperature joint 
distribution technique 
 
This multi-temperature joint distribution technique is developed by the Energy and 
Resource Laboratory, Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan.  The 
technique is similar to the refrigerated cold accumulation and insulating cabinet 
multi-temperature joint distribution technique described above. However, this 
technique has been improved so as to reduce handling time and to increase the 
capacity utilization ratio.  It utilizes replaceable cold accumulators (eutectic plates) 
 7
technique. This is because the replaceable cold accumulating and insulating box 
multi-temperature joint distribution technique can reduce the use of refrigerated and 
frozen vehicles by applying regular ones, thereby lowering the number of vehicles 
and routing expenses. Hsu (2006) compared the refrigerated multi-temperature joint 
distribution technique and the traditional multi-vehicle distribution technique focusing 
on local service network in terms of their costs and benefits and found that they differ 
mostly in purchase and depreciation costs of vehicles and equipment. 
 
On the other hand, there are more studies related to perishable commodities and 
low-temperature logistics than those of multi-temperature logistics. Some of these 
focus on discussions about stock models of perishable commodities. For example, 
Ghara and Schrader (1963) discussed the problems of perishable commodity stocks 
for the first time and assumed that the decay rate of the stocks to be a constant. The 
mathematical model of Ghara and Schrader was further extended by Cover and Philip 
(1973), and the decayed rate was assumed as a Weibull distribution to construct the 
best economical order quantity model (EOQ Model). From then on, fresh products’ 
decay rate was mostly assumed to be a Weibull distribution in most of the past studies 
(e.g., Hariga, 1996; Giri and Chaudhuri, 1998; Charkrabarty et al., 1998).  
 
Zhang et al. (2003) considered the distribution structure of the whole frozen food 
chain, including factories, wholesalers, and retailers, and used kinetics to discuss the 
degree of commodity quality being decreased over time. They then applied the Tabu 
search (TS) to figure out a frozen food distribution structure that could minimize the 
storage and transportation cost of the whole system in order to make the solution more 
efficient. The dynamic Tabu list and punishment cost were incorporated into the 
solution process. Jacxsens et al. (2002) studied the influence of changing temperature 
and time on cargo quality during the transportation of fresh vegetables and fruits 
using simulation. The results showed that during transportation, temperatures could 
change the gas composition inside the vehicle and make an impact on commodity 
quality. Net et al. (2003) conducted a research on the problem of the temperature 
 9
However, since each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, operators 
need to determine the appropriate technique for various routes and terminals in 
accordance with their shipping demand.  They ought to take into account the 
configuration of their operational network, the temporal and spatial distribution of 
different-temperature cargo demands, variations in costs, and the capacity utilization 
of each multi-temperature technique so as to minimize the delivery cost of the whole 
service network. The combinations of multi-temperature techniques available for the 
operations of service networks increase exponentially with the number of terminals 
and routes. Moreover, the use of vehicles of various sizes on the routes also influence 
techniques applied to the terminals.  
 
In response to the considerations above, this study constructs a model to determine the 
optimal multi-temperature logistics techniques for terminal and vehicle routing 
operations by minimizing the total delivery costs comprised of transportation cost and 
cargo-handling cost from the operator’s viewpoint. Transportation cost includes 
vehicle and terminal costs, both of which include initial fixed cost and variable 
operation cost. This study classifies the model into two parts, the first of which 
initially focuses on constructing a binary integer programming model by minimizing 
the terminal transportation and cargo-handling costs to determine the 
multi-temperature logistics techniques and cargo handling quantities for terminals. 
The second part is to relax integer constraints based on results from the first one in 
order to develop an algorithm to determine the vehicle transportation cost and vehicle 
routing operations. And then combines the results of the model and the algorithm to 
search the appropriate technique(s) for each terminal and vehicle routing operations 
according to the Branch and Bound method under the “the best, the first search” 
principle.  This paper is organized as follows. Section Two describes the formulation 
of the binary integer programming model. The algorithm for solving vehicle 
transportation cost is introduced in Section Three. Section Four presents a case study 
to illustrate the feasibility and results of the models, and finally, Section Five presents 
conclusions and suggestions for future studies.

Chen, 2004) and takes the hub in the cluster as the origin and destination for vehicle 
routing and allows stops midway. The hubs are connected by vehicles of large sizes 
and are called the primary trunk line. Stops along the path can accommodate 
loading/unloading operations at the same time. The vehicle path in this study has 
features for vehicle type and capacity; therefore, this path does not confirm to the 
features of the minimum spanning tree.  
 
This study aims to minimize the daily delivery cost, including transportation cost and 
cargo handling cost. The transportation cost includes the terminal cost and the vehicle 
cost, part of which is the fixed cost of initial investment mainly related to the vehicle’s 
type and size. Vehicles of different types also differ in maintenance costs and service 
life. Operating cost incurred from vehicle deliveries refers to the cost of fuel 
consumption and is mainly related to the delivery distance (vehicle path), vehicle type, 
and size. In this study, the above vehicle costs are generally termed as vehicle 
purchase and operating costs. The terminal cost also includes the fixed cost for initial 
investment and the operating cost for daily operations. Both of them are related to the 
adopted technology and handling volume of the terminal and are called the terminal 
setup and operating cost. For regular cargoes free of temperature controlled 
requirements, the terminal setup and operating costs do not vary because of the 
technology adopted. Hence, in dealing with the handling volume of cargoes, it only 
needs to calculate those required to be stored in appropriate temperatures such as 
refrigerated and frozen cargoes, which also depend on the technology adopted. Cargo 
handling cost refers to the cost of cargoes on the vehicles that pass the terminal’s path 
and have been processed by the terminal. The cargo handling cost is paid for loading 
and unloading, which is commonly outsourced. Other than the basic labor service and 
equipment, the cargo handling cost in this study is defined as the additional costs of 
labor service and machinery mainly related to the technology used and the handling 
volume of cargoes needed to be stored in appropriate temperatures.  
 
Though as vehicle size increases the vehicle purchase and operating cost increases, 
 13
technique 2t  can share facilities in the same terminal, they could be considered as 
a whole. On the other hand, terminals that use techniques 2 ,1t , and those that use 
technique 3t  would have quite different cost patterns. The setup cost when the 
terminal uses techniques 2 ,1t  belongs to the sunk cost, that is, it needs a great 
amount of setup cost for its initial investment. This cost has the feature of scale 
economies and mainly includes hardware facilities cost and energy cost necessary for 
refrigerated and frozen cargoes. Furthermore, nC  represents the terminal setup and 
operating cost paid for each day when the terminal adopts techniques 2 ,1t  and 
subscript n  denotes the cargo handling volume level, including only 
refrigerated/frozen cargoes. As the terminal’s cargo handling volume increases as 
signified by increasing n , the terminal setup and operating cost that the terminal 
must pay for each day increases as well. The terminals of different levels also have 
their respective upper limits for daily cargo handling volume. If the daily volume 
exceeds the upper limit, the terminal cannot handle the volume. Hence, the terminal 
ought to choose the optimal level that can meet the terminal’s daily cargo handling 
volume.  
 
The setup cost is very low for a terminal that adopts technique 3t , which likewise 
features a very low threshold and low cost for initial investment.  Using such 
technique, only a small suitable amount of equipment needed to operate depending on 
the handling volume of multi-temperature cargoes.  However, this technique does 
not have apparent features in scale economies. The electricity fee attributed to the 
operating cost of this technique is of positive correlation to the quantity of equipment, 
of which scale economies are also not apparent. Thus, this study assumes that the 
terminal setup and operating cost paid for each day for technique 3t  has a positive 
linear relationship with the volume of refrigerated and frozen cargoes processed by 
the terminal each day as shown in Equation (2). The decision variables are

than the actual demand of center ks . Equation (13) sets the constraints that the cargo 
volume delivered from center ks  must be greater than the overall demand of the 
origin of center ks . Equation (14) sets the constraints that the cargo volume delivered 
from cluster 1k  to cluster 2k  must be greater than the total demand of the centers in 
the cluster where 1k  and 2k are the origin and destination of each origin-destination 
pair.  Equation (15) indicates that some of decision variables in the model are binary 
integers.

route. As discussed in previous sections, multi-temperature techniques adopted by 
operators directly and profoundly influence vehicle type and vehicle capacity 
utilization ratio. Thus, vehicle type will also directly influence the unit-distance 
operating cost and vehicle purchase cost. As a result, the vehicle transportation cost is 
related to the multi-temperature logistics technique adopted by vehicles, vehicle path, 
and the maximum demand volume that can possibly be loaded into one vehicle for 
each day. The operator has different requirements on facilities at a hub and at a center, 
which further influences loading and unloading efficiency.  
 
This study assumes in the example of Section Four that the minimum truck headway 
on the primary path is 1 hour with the maximum frequency of 24 shifts/day and that 
the minimum truck headway for the secondary path is 2 hours. Those values are set 
corresponding to the actual operation in the example and also for the sake of easily 
getting the costs at a, b, and c points on Figure 2, i.e. the vehicle purchase and 
operating costs. 
  
Based on the above cost features, this study designs a vehicle cost algorithm for a 
hierarchal hub and spoke network with three clusters, each of which is with two 
centers, respectively. Figure 3 depicts the framework of the vehicle cost algorithm. 
The algorithm first solves the binary integer programming model constructed in the 
previous section by relaxing the integer conditions and then calculates the vehicle 
costs for primary and secondary trunk lines, respectively. This calculation framework 
can be further described using the following eight steps:  
 
Step 1. Calculate the cargo volumes to and from the terminal.  
Calculate not only the cargo volume of each temperature zone but also the sum of all 
of the multi-temperature cargoes delivered to and from the terminal by all vehicles on 
the primary trunk line under techniques 2 ,1t  and 3t , respectively. 
 
Step 2. Calculate the maximum cargo volume loaded by the vehicle at one day. 
 19
vehicle compartment ratio of 1:1:2, which is similar to current practical operation. 
Thus, this study continues the analysis using this ratio.  
 
The secondary trunk line has four feasible paths, including two all-service paths 
(passing through all centers) and two direct paths (no stopovers). Since the maximum 
volume of cargoes loaded by vehicles on the secondary trunk line at one day must 
appear in the flow to or from the terminal, the all-service path will be equal when the 
volume is calculated. Therefore, when the all-service path is chosen based on the 
indexes related to the delivery volume, only can the path with the lowest cost be 
chosen. While the primary trunk line has six feasible paths, three of which are 
all-service paths and the other three are direct paths, then the maximum cargo volume 
loaded by vehicles on the all-service paths cannot be the same and should be 
considered separately. Finally, based on the feature of paths on the primary trunk line, 
calculate the maximum cargo volume loaded by vehicles used by a variety of delivery 
combinations at one day.  When the calculation is completed, proceed to the next 
step.  
  
Step 3. Select delivery combination  
Follow the greedy principle, select the delivery combination for maximum cargo 
volume as calculated from the previous step, and obtain the vehicle, routes, types of 
cargoes delivered, and vehicle space provided. After this step, move to the next step.  
 
Step 4. Recalculate the cargo volume to and from the terminal  
Calculate the cargo volume to/from the terminal that can possibly be reduced based 
on the results obtained from the previous step by following the principle that “the 
more the cargo volume in the terminal is, the earlier the reduction takes place.”  
Then obtain again the results in step 1.  
 
Step 5. Check whether calculations on the cluster and the primary trunk line are 
completed or not.

of vehicles can directly influence the choice of terminal techniques. However, it is not 
easy to solve the problem with above features using the method of the traditional 
integer programming model. Hence, the study develops the abovementioned vehicle 
cost algorithm aimed at incorporating the above features in the solution process.  
 
IV. Example 
 
Based on the current situation of domestic logistics in Taiwan, the study area is 
divided into three clusters, namely: A (Taipei), B (Taichung), and C (Tainan), which 
are located at the northern, central, and southern parts of Taiwan, respectively. The 
total length of the study area from south to north is about 400 Km, which is 
appropriate for highway-truck distribution. Cluster A is more on the demand end of 
cargoes, while Cluster C is more on the supply end of cargoes. Cluster B has no 
apparent features on demand and supply. Moreover, the overall cargo flows in 
Clusters A and C are apparently larger than that in cluster B. Among all types of 
cargoes, regular cargoes account for the majority of cargoes shipped by the current 
logistics carriers, followed by refrigerated cargoes, and finally, frozen cargoes. The 
ratio for the three types of cargoes is about 4:2:1. 
 
The study sets the values of cost related parameters based on the operating condition 
of the example in practice. Table 3 lists the terminal setup and operating costs related 
to refrigeration and frozen facilities for the hub and the center, which adopt 
techniques 2 ,1t , respectively. The handling volume of one unit is equivalent to 
one heat-insulated box of 180-liter volume, and each storage slot can store two units. 
The adequate number of storage slots required for the terminal is designed as one half 
of its daily flow volume. The daily maintenance cost is about 7%~10% of the daily 
setup cost and the daily operation cost is about 61%~66% of the terminal’s overall 
daily setup cost. The current values of operation and equipment initial setup costs are 
converted from the project’s economic annual value assuming the equipment lifespan 
of about six years and an annual interest rate of 6%. Since the hub and centers have 
 23
operating costs. The vehicle maintenance cost is about 7% of the purchase cost. When 
the terminal operates with technique 1t  using frozen, refrigerated, and regular 
vehicles, there are large (25-ton), medium (10-ton), and small (3.5-ton) vehicles 
available for loading 200, 70, and 20 units (1 unit=180 liter), respectively. The 
terminal cargo handling cost is NTD 7 per 180-liter unit.  When the terminal 
operates with technique 2t  using vehicles of three-temperature ranges, the 
capacity it can provide is 90% of that of technique 1t . The terminal cargo handling 
cost is NTD 10 per 180-liter unit. When the terminal operates with technique 3t  
using regular vehicles, the capacity it can provide is 80% of that of technique 1t  
and the terminal cargo handling cost is NTD 20 per 180-liter unit.  
 
We then perform the example using the model developed in the earlier section and 
cost parameters in accordance with the practical situation as described above. The 
results are shown in Table 5 and indicate that techniques 2 ,1t  are suitable for hubs 
and centers in Clusters A and C.  On the other hand, the hub in Cluster B does not 
have any apparent preference among the three techniques. Meanwhile, all of the 
centers apparently tend to adopt the equipment of technique 3t . As a result, it 
shows that the hub’s adoption of equipment and facilities under techniques 2 ,1t  is 
much more apparent than those of centers. Hence, we can conclude that technique 
3t  is suitable for those terminals with a small shipping volume, and this result also 
conforms to the conclusion drawn from common sense and real situations.  
 
This study assumes that the spatial distribution of each terminal and the size of the 
network are already known. However, the spatial distribution of terminals will 
influence the cargo handling volume of each terminal.  That is, when the total 
demand is fixed, and there are several operators competing for the same market, then 
terminals will be more densely distributed with less shipping volume. Meanwhile, 
centers set up by the same operator are usually more than hubs, which is also a feature 
of the hierarchical network. Moreover, the volumes of cargoes processed by different 
terminals are distinctively varied when operators have different network structures 
 25
related to terminal and vehicle costs, as shown in Figure 4. However, since this study 
adopts the heuristic method to solve the problem, the solutions obtained are discrete 
points and may not be the best. Hence, it is difficult to see the relationship between 
demand volumes and those costs from Figure 4. This study further assumes that the 
terminal cost function as 11 bS xaC  and the vehicle cost function as 22 bV xaC  , 
where x  is the total volume of refrigerated and frozen cargoes in all terminals, and 
2121  , , , bbaa  are the parameters to be calibrated. While parameter values 21  , bb  have 
economic meaning, i.e. when 1 , 21 bb , it indicates there are economies of scale in 
the terminal and vehicle cost. Otherwise, it indicates there is no economies of scale. 
The study further calibrates those parameters using the least square method, and 
obtains that 911.3281 a , 801.3572 a , 774574.01 b , and 769691.02 b , with 
an error of about 5%. The results indicate that the costs related to the terminal and 
vehicles both indeed exhibit the feature of scale economies, while vehicle cost is more 
apparent than the costs related to the terminal. This result is possibly due to the 
concept that the terminal’s handling, setup, and operating costs for technique 3t  
are usually lacking scale economy features. Hence, the result conforms to the 
expectation in practice and the logic of the algorithm to determine vehicle costs 
developed by this study. Furthermore, it also indicates an accurate and reasonable 
solution can be obtained from the heuristic method.  
 
Since the terminal setup and operating cost per 180-liter unit using technique 3t  
may change because of new technical developments, the operator’s operating 
procedures, and the coat estimation method, this study further changes the terminal 
setup and operating cost using 3t  by -15%, -10%, -5%, 5%, 10%, and 15% and 
performs sensitivity analysis. The results indicate that when the demand is 0.5~1 
times of the original demand, the optimal ratio of three techniques usage changes 
significantly. That is, the lower the terminal setup and operating cost per unit of 3t , 
the more likely the terminal will use technique 3t . However, the results of these 
 27
the links from north to south is 2:1:4 , while that in the links from south to north is 
1:2:4. The result indicates that the pattern of technique adoption will be markedly 
different from the original one, namely, when the combination of various temperature 
cargoes is imbalanced in different flow directions the operator will then tend to use 
vehicles with flexibility in the use of delivery space to accommodate the difference. 
Table 7 lists the vehicle ratio of multi-temperature joint distribution ( 2t  & 3t ) 
and cargo handling volumes for terminals adopting technique 3t . Since the 
utilization in the vehicle space of regular vehicles in technique 3t  is better than 
that of three-compartment refrigerated vehicles in technique 2t , therefore, the 
percentage of terminals using technique 3t  is shown to be apparently high.  
When the demand ratio is 0.25, 0.5, 1.75, and 2, the vehicle ratio and cargo handling 
volume of using the multi-temperature joint distribution technique do not change due 
to the demand being still quite low.  However, as discussed earlier, when the demand 
is high enough, then the adoption of techniques 2 ,1t  will dominate. In such cases, 
the benefits in scale economies brought by techniques 2 ,1t  are higher than the 
benefits in the space flexibility brought by technique 3t .  
 
V. Conclusion and recommendations  
 
There are few academic studies related to the in-depth analysis and discussion of 
multi-temperature logistics. New technologies such as the replaceable cold 
accumulation and insulation box multi-temperature joint distribution technique will 
not only provide better temperature control, but also reduce the influence of time and 
temperature on cargo quality and its environmental impact. However, previous studies 
rarely dealt with issues on analyzing and deciding multi-temperature logistics 
techniques in a hub and spoke freight transportation network. Moreover, the current 
trend in cargo delivery moves towards a variety of categories, small shipments, and 
multi-temperatures. Hence, this study includes a new technique as one option to 
discuss for multi-temperature logistics operation by means of medium-term to 
long-term operation planning. It also solves the optimal multi-temperature logistics 
 29
algorithm to determine vehicle cost developed. Together with the developed algorithm, 
the followings are the advantages of the model developed in this study: (1) It can be 
solved within a polynomial time:(2) It reflects the feature of vehicle scale economy: 
and (3) It reflects that the space flexibility of regular vehicles using technique 3t  
is better than that of three-compartment refrigerated vehicles using technique 2t .  
 
Several extensions could be done for future studies.  When clusters, hubs, and 
centers contained in the operating network increase continuously, it is suggested to 
solve the problem with a common heuristics for the Branch & Bound method, such as 
Column Generation. Moreover, vehicle algorithm will directly influence the solution 
quality, future studies should discusses the topic about vehicles in depth and further 
improve the vehicle cost algorithm. Environmental protection has also been a popular 
issue in recent years. The public has imposed increasingly stricter requirements on 
delivery quality, and market competition has become fiercer than ever. This study 
provides intensive discussion and analysis on new technologies, so that the 
multi-temperature logistics operators could have options in response to the changing 
trend of external environment and markets in the future.

II.  MODEL FORMULATION 
 
In this section, this study formulates customers 
demand function and manufacturer total cost when 
adopting discriminating and uniform service strategies.  
Specifically, this study employs the analytical method to 
formulate the supply cost function by considering the 
time-dependent demand of various customers in different 
regions.  Then, this study formulates and incorporates 
disaggregate choice models to estimate customer demand 
for the manufacturer product.  Furthermore, this study 
develops a mathematical programming model for 
determining the optimal capacity and production amount 
of the manufacturing plants, delivery service cycles for 
customers in different regions and the assignment of 
plants to customers during the study period, taking into 
account time-dependent customer demand, demand-
supply interactions.   
 
a. discriminating service strategy 
The decision maker in this study is a manufacturer who 
operates multiple high-tech product manufacturing plants 
around the world and delivers the final product to serve 
customers in different regions.  This study proposes a 
discriminating service strategy, which differs from the 
traditional and typical uniform service strategy where 
customers at different regions are served according to the 
same delivery cycle.  Periods with considerable demands 
suggest that frequent and short service cycles are suitable 
and may stimulate customer demand for products and 
reduce logistics cost due to shipping economies.  
Consequently, long service cycles are suggested when 
demand is very low.  In addition, delay in receiving 
products is determined here as time span between 
customer purchasing and receiving products, and depends 
on service cycles and average distances between plants 
and customers.   
Let s and k denote a specific customer and a 
manufacturing plant, respectively.  And let si  and )( siT  
be a specific service cycle and duration of service cycle 
si  for customer s under discriminating service strategy 
during the study period, ))( ),(()( 0 smss ititiT  , si =1,2,..,

Figure 1 The profile of service cycles 
Consider two curves in Figure 1 representing cumulative 
number of products, which have been: (1) purchased by 
customer s; (2) delivered by the manufacture.  To satisfy 
customer demand accumulated during service cycles, the 
manufacturer must assign which manufacturing plants as 
well as their production to serve customers in different 
regions.  Let )( sk if  represent product amount produced 
by plant k and deliver to customer s for service cycle si .  
To meet customer demand during service cycle si , the 
following equation must be satisfied: 

delivers products to customer s for service cycle si , then

otherwise, 0)( sk i .  Total product demand of customer

Regarding products delivery, total amount of products 
delivered by plant k during the study period can be 
 delivery in inventory cost will be offset by the increased 
transportation cost if product amount delivered per 
shipment fall short of economical shipment size.  Since 
the goal of delivery and service strategies is to reduce 
logistics cost and satisfy customer needs, the number and 
duration of service cycles should be determined in 
accordance with the time-dependent demand of customers 
in various regions.  To avoid double counting, inventory 
cost discussed here reflects the relationship between the 
production and delivery cycles of plants.  The average 
waiting time can be measured by one half of the headway 
between two consecutive shipments under a continuous 
production.  The inventory cost of plant k during the study 
period can then be formulated as follows:

where g represents the inventory cost per unit product

duration of service cycles, leads to a decreased inventory 
cost.  The average inventory cost per unit product during 
the study period can be shown as:

Eqs. (8) and (10) show the relationship between 
transportation cost and inventory cost with respect to 
shipment size, delivery frequency and the assignment of 
plants to customers during the study period.  There are 
two sided effects on transportation cost if the 
manufacturer assigns frequent delivery cycles to serve 
customers whose periods are featured with large demand.  
The average transportation cost would be low only if large 
shipment could be accumulated and shipping economies 
exists.  Otherwise, frequent shipment leads to high 
transportation cost because of large fixed transportation 
cost.  The transportation cost will be even higher if 
customers are served by multiple plants whose distance 
are far apart.  The above perspective also implies that long 
service cycles are suitable when demand is very low.  
From Eqs. (5), (8) and (10), the total average cost per unit 
product are: 
drh                                            (11) 
The discussions so far demonstrate how service cycles 
and the assignments of plants to customers influence 
manufacturer’s cost.  This study further deals with 
dynamic and time-sensitive customer demand, and 
investigate how service cycle durations affects customer 
demand for manufacturer products.  This study applies a 
binary logit model to determine customer choice 
probabilities for manufacturer products.  Let o  be the 
objective manufacturer and r  be a representative of other 
manufacturers in the market.  Let ),( tsU x  represent the 
total utility of customer s who purchase products from

1  and 2  are parameters, respectively.   
Delay in receiving products depends on service cycles and 
average transportation time to customers in different 
regions.  The demand of products during a specific 
service cycle may be received separately since it may 
involve various plants serve a specific customer, thereby 
resulting in an inconsistent product receiving time.  Let 
siH  be the average transportation time from plants to 
customer s, and

purchasing time.  As customer purchasing time 
approaches dispatching date, the customer perceives a 
decreased delay in receiving products. 
Normally, total customer demand for manufacturer

The mathematical programming problem for determining 
the optimal number of service cycles for different 
customers assuming a uniform service strategy can be 
formulated in a manner similar to that assuming a 
discriminating service strategy ((18a)-(18i)).  Furthermore, 
this study compares the values of profit obtained by the 
manufacturer from discriminating and uniform service 
strategies using %100

profit using discriminating and uniform service strategies, 
respectively.  If %100

III.  CASE STUDY 
This section presents an application of the proposed 
models, using a numerical example.  The object 
manufacturer is D-company of the USA who 
manufactures and assembles different key-components 
into notebooks as the product and delivers the final 
product to the customers in different regions.  Total 
customers are classified according to the geographic 
distributions, which result in five major customers, such 
as USA, West Europe, Japan, China and Taiwan.  This 
study assumes three months, from September to 
November, as the study period, with the unit of time for 
study being one day.  For the sake of simplicity, three 
locations are available for D-company in operating the 
manufacturing plants, that is, the USA (Texas), Malaysia 
(Penang) and China (Xiamen).  The capacity cost and 
variable production cost of these locations are different 
due to the various commodity indexes in different regions.  
In addition, to satisfy the substantial demand and gain 
advantage through outsourcing, the original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs) in Taiwan and Korea are also 
available and the notebooks from these OEMs are tagged 
as being D-company’s product.  The average price and 
key-component purchase cost per unit notebook are US$ 
1330 and US$ 1150, respectively.  The base values for the 
parameters in production and transportation cost functions 
are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  Table 1 lists 
the initial transportation parameters with respect to 
different combinations of the manufacturing plants and 
customers, including fixed transportation cost and 
variable transportation cost, while Table 2 lists the 
average transportation time from locations of the 
manufacturing plants to customers.  Table 3 shows the 
alternative sizes of capacity and base production 
parameters for manufacturing plants in different regions.  
As shown in Table 3, there are three different alternative 
sizes of capacity for the manufacturing plants in the USA 
(Texas) and Malaysia (Penang) and two alternatives for 
the manufacturing plant in China (Xiamen).  The unit-
product production costs paid for the outsourcing 
manufacturers are different with the outsourcing amount, 
in a way that the outsourcing manufacturers encourage 
large size outsourcing with preferential price.  Figure 1 
illustrates time-dependent demand from the five major 
customers during the study period.

Note: (1): fixed transportation cost; (2): variable 
transportation cost 
 service cycles also exist for the manufacturing plants and 
customers whose distance is short with large product 
flows.  However, as shown in Table 4, some customers 
are served by distant manufacturing plants rather than a 
near plant.  It is likely that assigning these plants to serve 
the distant customers is more cost effective than assigning 
other plants to serve these customers.  The results imply 
that the optimal assignments are determined from an 
entire network perspective, not from an individual node-
to-node basis.  Moreover, this study proposes a 
discriminating delivery service strategy in response to 
time-dependent customer demand.  And the optimal 
dispatching date of the manufacturing plants for the 
customers can be obtained from the models.  Table 5 
shows the optimal dispatching dates of plants in serving 
the customers.

The results shown in Table 4 are obtained from models 
without considering the impacts of demand-supply 
interactions on the production decisions.  The optimal 
capacity of the manufacturing plants is determined when 
the customer demand is exogenous.  Though customer 
intention to purchase notebooks from D-company could 
be increased by serving them with frequent delivery 
service cycles, the total profit might be low if the 
production cost is high.  With reference to Table 3, D-
company tends to operate large-size capacity plants to 
meet the demands.  However, the capacity utilizations of 
these manufacturing plants are low, i.e. the utilizations of 
the plants in USA (Texas), Malaysia (Penang) and China 
being 51.69%, 49.19% and 43.64%.  These low utilization 
values result in an increased production cost for D-
company, thus a decreased profit.  This study further 
assumes all customers are served with the same delivery 
service cycles as Table 4 shows, thus the changes in 
customer demand can be neglected.  Eqs. (6.18a) and 
(6.18f) are applied to optimize the capacity and 
production amount for the manufacturing plants, where 
data on customer demand is given and shown as Table 4.  
The revised results are shown as Table 6.

demand-supply interaction on production decisions.

Average transportation cost 
(US$/item) 19.18  
Average production cost (US$/item) 102.75  
As shown in Table 6, instead of all plants, D-company 
adopts merely two manufacturing plants, China (Xiamen) 
and Taiwan, to serve the customers, where there is full 
capacity production in China and surplus output from the 
OEM in Taiwan.  The average production cost is 
US$102.75 per notebook, which is lower as compared 
with that in Table 5.  The results show the impacts of 
customer demand for the manufacturer product on profit 
lie not only on the logistics cost, but also on the 
production cost, therefore, profit.  The decisions on 
capacity and production amount may not lead to 
profitable results if the demand-supply interaction is not 
considered.  However, increased specialization requires 
increased transportation and an increased logistics cost 
exists in Table 6.  The results show there is a tradeoff 
between production cost economies and transportation 
cost diseconomies.  However, the large profit implies that 
the benefits brought by centralized production outweigh 
the increased transportation cost by decentralized for D-
company.  This finding also suggests that the 
manufacturer may adopt a strategy with centralized 
production and deliver the products to customers in 
different regions with frequent delivery service cycles.   
Delivery service strategies must not only realize 
transportation cost economies, but also satisfy customer 
needs.  Previous studies have considered physical 
distribution problems other than demand-supply 
 interaction, the manufacturer typically pursues 
transportation cost economies and minimized logistics 
cost by assuming inelastic customer demand and applying 
less delivery service cycles.  However, this strategy 
overestimates customer demand and yields higher 
production cost, leading to a reduced profit than strategies 
that consider demand-supply interaction.  The finding in 
this study also implies that the delivery service strategy 
may not only affect customer demand for the 
manufacturer product and logistics cost, but also 
production cost.

Abstract 
This study focuses on supply chain network design problems by considering 
economies scale and demand fluctuations.  A MIP model is developed to discover 
how scale economies, demands and investment conditions affect the locations 
capacity of plants and production allocation among them.  Then, a reliability 
evaluation method is developed to evaluate the performance of plants under demand 
fluctuations.  Two mathematical programming models with respect to demand 
expansions and shrinkage are further developed to determine the optimal adjustment 
decisions.  Results show that performing an adjustment benefits the manufacturers in 
way that total production cost can be reduced and revenue loss is avoided, which 
outweigh the additional costs.  Results also imply the manufacturer could neglect an 
abnormal state with a short period, due to the accumulated benefits might not 
compensate the high allocation costs.  The results of the study provide a reference 
for the manufacturer in the decision making procedures of network planning under 
demand fluctuations, as they cope with related benefits, costs and the duration of 
abnormal months.

Eskigun et al. 2005).  Due to the fact that large-scale models have proven to be 
extremely difficult for solving optimality, most of this research developed 
deterministic mixed integer programming models and focused on model 
improvements and algorithms to solve developed models.  In addition, though such 
network designs can be seen as bases for short-run manufacturers’ operational 
planning, the performance results of network designs, apart from demand fluctuations, 
were generally not evaluated. 
The impact of uncertainty on manufacturer efficiency has prompted a lot of 
studies to address stochastic parameters in supply chain planning.  At the static level, 
there is a great deal of research developing production/inventory models that involve 
uncertainties in the environment, and the attention has been focused mostly on the 
probabilistic modeling of the customer demand side (e.g. Cachon and Fisher, 2000; 
Gavirneni et al., 1999).  Other studies dealt with supply uncertainties, such as 
machine breakdowns, strikes, shortages in material availability, etc.  The majority of 
this research employed and modified EOQ formulas to include random variables 
reflecting different uncertainties (e.g. Hariga and Haouari, 1999; Wang and Gerchak, 
1996).  The aim of these studies is the determination of operational policies, rather 
than strategic design.   
Taking another approach, several studies have used stochastic programming to 
formulate optimization problems that involve uncertain input parameters (e.g. Santoso 
et al., 2005; Tsiakis et al., 2001).  These studies focused on providing efficient 
algorithms that solve the stochastic integer programming models and presenting 
computational results on supply chain network involving different number of nodes, 
arcs or products.  However, abnormal states occur unexpectedly, which result in 
severe demand fluctuations and affecting the performance of a well-design network 
within the abnormal state continues.  Instead of reconstructing the whole network, it 
 4
different locations affect the manufacturer decisions regarding the locations of the 
manufacturing plants, their capacity and production allocation among these plants.  
The assignment of customers and manufacturing plants in different locations as well 
as their monthly product flows are also determined by investigating the impacts of the 
geographical distance and the demand volumes on total costs.  Then, this study 
focuses on reliability evaluation and adjustment of the supply chain network design in 
responding different demand fluctuations.  The reliability evaluation method 
proposed in this study evaluates the performance of different manufacturing plants on 
condition that abnormal fluctuations occur.  In responding demand fluctuations, two 
mathematical programming models with respect to demand expansions and demand 
shrinkage are further developed to determine the optimal adjustment decisions, 
regarding production reallocations, manufacturing plants-customers reassignments 
and outsourcing firms selections, etc.  The decisions on whether or not to perform an 
adjustment is also investigated by comparing between the results if no adjustments are 
made and if adjustment are made during the duration of an abnormal state. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the supply 
chain network design problem and presents the reliability evaluation method of 
proposed capacity and production planning for manufacturing plants.  Section 3 
provides a fine-tuning method for adjusting the production allocation among 
manufacturing plants in response to different demand fluctuations.  A case study is 
provided in Section 4 to illustrate the application of the models.  Section 5 presents 
concluding remarks. 
2. Description and formulation of the problems 
This study aims at designing a supply chain network for a high-tech product 
manufacturer who operates multiple manufacturing plants in different regions.  The 
supply chain design problem is this paper is defined as follows: given customer

And, 1k
k

1kn  serves manufacturing plant kn  and customer sn  is served by manufacturing 
plant kn , respectively.  Since demand from all customers should be satisfied, the 
following equation holds: 

The production cost herein captures impacts of the locations, capacity of the 
manufacturing plants and the production allocation among them on the optimal 
network design.  The production cost incorporates both the capital cost and variable 
production cost.  The capital cost is costs attribute to purchasing and installation of 
related equipment, and plant construction and land rental fee, etc., rather than 
production amount, which differs among plants due to different locations and capacity 
size.  And the variable production cost includes those paid for input factors other 
than materials, such as labor, utility and insurance, etc.  The average production cost 
per-unit product of manufacturing plant kn  can be formulated as:

production cost of manufacturing plant kn .  Eq. (3) shows that the average 
production cost decreases with increasing production amount at which the extent 
depends upon the capital cost with respect to the capacity.  The average production 
cost per-unit product for the manufacturer, kH , can be further expressed as follows:

In practice, some abnormal events may occur and continue at a particular market, 
such as finance crisis, war or natural disaster, economy recovery, which further cause 
demand from that market fluctuates over a time span.  The network performance is 
affected in a way that the more fluctuating demand is different from the forecasted 
with a long time span, the more accumulated revenue loss the manufacturer will surfer.  
An abnormal state is one in which monthly customer demand values dose not follow

The manufacturer could also decide to stay in status quo and do nothing such that

however, revenue loss or customer service downgraded exist due to unsatisfied

unit-product penalty cost can be estimated based on the unit-product price, P, and a

We determine the capacity of manufacturing plants, i.e. sizes of FABs in various 
locations and their production amounts as well as the monthly flows from each of the 
FAB to customers in different regions using supply chain design model P1 (Eqs. 
10(a)-10(h)), and employ the simulated annealing (SA) heuristic proposed by 
Kirkpatrick et al. (1983) to obtain the solutions.  The initial solution results are listed 
in Table 3.

plant combined with the full-capacity production yields a lowest cost.  Since demand 
from customers in North America account for the largest demands for T-company, 
most of the FABs solely serve customers from that area.   
A hypothetical scenario involving abnormal situations is further considered in 
this case study.  We suppose that an explosion in demand from customers in China 
owing to government policy in promoting the usage of integrated circuit identity card, 
which is a by-product of wafer foundry.  The data concerning this abnormal state, 
including occurrence duration, abnormal demand distribution and duration 
probabilities, is listed in Table 4.  The expected demand distribution from the 
abnormal location, China, is also calculated and shown in Table 8.  The reliabilities 
of the FABs in different locations, considering abnormal states, are calculated using 
Eq. (17), and the resulting reliability values are listed in Table 5.

Figure 1 The threshold of adjust/do-nothing judgments by comparing between 
unit-product outsourcing and penalty costs 
As stated, no adjustment is suggested if the adjustment benefits cannot offset the 
adjustment cost, where the adjustment benefits are given by the sum of savings in 
production cost and the exemption from the penalty cost.  Given the savings in 
production cost, a decreased penalty cost leads to shrunk adjustment benefits.  Thus, 
the tendency towards adopting an adjustment is small with a decreased penalty cost, 
as shown in Figure 1.  Since the penalty cost reflects market value of the product, the 
result suggests the manufacturer to stick by the initial proposed decisions and neglect 
the abnormal demand if the product value is low.  On the other hand, it is worth 
performing an adjustment and continuing to outsource for a high value-added product,

Figure 2 The threshold of adjust/do-nothing judgments by comparing between 
duration of abnormal months and fixed allocation costs 
As long as the adjustment benefits outweigh the adjustment costs, the network 
should be adjusted.  In some ways, the adjustment decisions depend on whether the 
adjusted production amount can effectively share the high fixed allocation cost.  As 
shown in Figure 2, the threshold of an adjustment is increased with an increasing 
duration of abnormal months, meaning a high fixed allocation cost will not prevent 
the manufacturer from performing an adjustment.  In other words, the results imply 
the manufacturer could neglect the unreliable situations resulting from an abnormal 
state with a short period, because the accumulated benefits during this short period 
will not compensate the high costs.  The results of the study provide a reference for 
the manufacturer in the decision making procedures of network planning under 
demand expansions, as they cope with related benefits, costs and the duration of 
abnormal months.   
Another hypothetical scenario involving abnormal situations, causing demand 
 34
shown in Table 1.  To satisfy the considerable demands, most FABs produce the 
product and serve solely customers from this location, as shown in Table 3.  The 
occurrence of an abnormal state in North America will remarkably influence the 
performance of the FABs in different locations.  As shown in Table 9, the abnormal 
state in North America results in low reliabilities for most FABs.  Though the 
performance expectation for the FAB in Singapore is not as high as the others, it 
exhibits low reliability value as well.  This is because the output from the FAB in 
Singapore gets a small percentage of total output from T-company, i.e. 
kn
 0.125 as 
compared with 
kn
  being 0.175 of the other FABs.  When total demands declines, 
the production amount of the FAB in Singapore declines even more than the others.  
For the sake of simplification, this study focuses on the unreliable situation arising 
from demand shrinkage from North America and proposes an adjustment strategy by 
solving P3 (Eqs. 32(a)-32(e)).  The set of adjustment months, y, is y={1, 2, 3}, 
totaling 3 months.  And the total monthly customer demands during these months is 
estimated as 513754 pieces of 8-inch eq. wafers.  Table 10 shows the initial values of 
parameters in P3 and Table 11 lists the results and the optimal objective function 
values, respectively.

on total production costs is offset by the reduced production costs.  To serve 
customers from Europe originally served by the FAB in Singapore, the FAB in Taiwan 
(Hsinchu) is assigned to serve them due to the low compensation cost.  Table 11 also 
shows that the assignment of the FABs and customers in different locations as well as 
their monthly product flows are similar to those as proposed.  The results imply that 
partial adjustment is encouraged, rather than a whole network consideration, since the 
whole network reconstruction will incur extra transportation and compensation costs.  
Summing up allocation costs, difference in production costs and transportation costs 
results in a negative value of total adjustment costs, which shows the adjustment 
benefits T-company with the severe fluctuations.   
5. Conclusions 
The goal has been to explore supply chain network design, by emphasizing on 
developing an approximation procedure and the efficiency of the proposed heuristics.  
This study develops a series models to investigate the supply chain design problems 
for high-tech product manufacturers in response to production economies scale and 
demand fluctuations.  An MIP models is first developed, to discover how economies 
of scale and customer demands affect the manufacturer decisions regarding the 
locations of the manufacturing plants, their capacity and production allocation among 
these plants.  Then, this study focuses on reliability evaluation and adjustment of the 
supply chain network design in responding different demand fluctuations.  The 
reliability evaluation method proposed in this study evaluates the performance of 
different manufacturing plants on condition that abnormal fluctuations occur.  Two 
mathematical programming models with respect to demand expansions and demand 
shrinkage are further developed.  This study shows how the advantage and 
disadvantage brought by the adjustment can be carefully considered in advance when 
solving the network adjustment problems.  This study also shows how the duration 
 38
shrinkage from customers with significance may result in low capacity utilizations for 
most manufacturing plants, yielding a high production cost.  In the circumstance, the 
result implies a centralized production is necessary, where the manufacturer 
determines a least economical plant being idle and the rest being full-capacity 
production.  The results also imply that a partial adjustment is always encouraged, 
rather than a whole network consideration, since the whole network reconstruction 
will incur extra transportation and compensation costs.  In sum, the results of the 
study provide a reference for the manufacturer in the decision making procedures of 
network planning under demand fluctuations, as they cope with related benefits, costs 
and the duration of abnormal months.   
This study can be extended in several ways.  In this study, the fixed allocation 
cost reflects the difficulty in searching a qualified outsourcing firm.  Total costs can 
be reduced by bargaining with some outsourcing firms and order their capacities in 
advance.  Future studies may expand this study’s model and address this issue by 
investigating the relative influences of the opportunity cost, occurrence duration, 
abnormal demand distributions and the probabilities on outsourcing firm selection 
decisions.  Second, the case study is based on a wafer foundry company in the 
semiconductor industry, which is characterized with extremely high capital cost.  
Future study may apply the model to different industry.  Such studies would need to 
examine the impact of capital cost and customer demand on production allocation 
among manufacturing plants and how the revenue is affected when the demand is not 
satisfied.

KEY WORDS : Perishable goods delivery; Multi-temperature; Joint distribution; 
Demand-supply interaction 
 
1. Introduction  
In light of high-quality fresh food demand, transportation demand for fresh food 
delivery has been continuously increased in urban area. How to jointly deliver food 
with different temperature-controlled requirements becomes an important issue for 
urban logistic carriers who provide both low temperature-controlled food and normal 
merchandise carrying services. This study aims to formulate a mathematical 
programming model to solve the optimal delivery cycle and service charge for 
multi-temperature distribution carriers. Compared with normal goods, perishable 
goods like fresh food need more strictly temperature control and less travel time in the 
shipping process due to characteristics such as short shelf life, quality decay with time 
and temperature changing. Once temperature-sensitive food contacts outside 
atmosphere due to door opening, the temperature inside the vehicle would be changed 
and the bacteria grow fast. For this reason, Industrial Technology Research Institute of 
Taiwan has developed a multi-temperature delivery system to distribute food of 
different temperature-layers in the same vehicle, which enable carriers to ship a 
 4 
sell fresh food to customers in the city, so food delivery time and shipping charge for 
each temperature-layer would influence their profits and their willing to consign in the 
future. The costs considered in the supply side in this study include transportation cost, 
inventory cost, penalty cost to compensate delivery delay, and energy cost to keep 
temperature.  In the demand side, the study considers shippers’ concerns such as 
food delivering within their time-windows, which are the time slots shippers request 
the food to be delivered, and ensure there is enough released time and profit of selling 
the food. Furthermore, the study explores demand-supply interaction and constructs a 
mathematical programming model to determine the optimal delivery cycles and 
service charges for jointly distributing multi-temperature food by maximizing the total 
profit of the carrier. 
Major subjects related to multi-temperature joint distribution include supply chain 
for perishable goods and its delivery strategy to customers. The issues of the fresh 
food transit process contain inventory, decay rate, package, routing and operational 
strategies. For research related to perishable inventory, Ghare and Schrade (1963) 
formulated a nonlinear model to solve the inventory problem for fresh food by 
assuming the decay rate as a constant. Covert and Philip (1973) extended Ghare and 
Schrade’s model but set the decay rate as Weibull distribution to construct an 
economic order quantity (EOQ) model, which became the foundation of follow-up 
 6 
 In addition to inventory and distribution network, there have been many studies 
focused on the phenomenon of quality and shelf life decayed with time in recent years. 
Bogataj et al. (2005) analyzed the importance to assure the stability of cold chains in 
the cold chains management (CCM), indicated what conditions should be fulfilled to 
assure that after robust perturbations of time delays, the behavior of the logistics chain 
would still be within the prescribed limits. Likar et al. (2006) analyzed the survey 
related to the situation of cold chain maintaining in food trade in Ljubljana based 
upon two hypotheses that a cold chain is interrupted in retail and the handling of food 
in retail varies. The results confirmed both of the hypotheses that in most of the cases, 
the temperatures measured differed from the required ones and the biggest differences 
were detected between temperatures indicated on cooling appliances and temperatures 
measured by calibrated thermometers. The findings have shown that conditions 
during food storage and in retail stores were not documented; there was no system to 
control the cold chain; and retailers were not familiar with the importance of 
maintaining a cold chain. Elliott and Halbert (2005) aimed to demonstrate satisfactory 
inter-UK transit of cold storage clinical trial material. The results showed that a 
modified four frozen gel pack configuration was suitable for summer transit; thus cold 
shipment verification was successfully carried out for a small-scale distribution 
operation. It was proven that refrigerated shipping conditions could be maintained 
 8 
2. Model 
For carriers in supply side, the costs considered for multi-temperature logistics in 
this study are inventory cost, penalty cost, transportation cost and energy cost. 
Inventory costs are time cost and storage cost for food in distribution center. Penalty 
cost exists when the delivery time-window is violated, transportation cost is related to 
vehicles usage and operating; and energy cost is spent for controlling food 
temperature in the transit process. The purpose of the model in this study is to find the 
optimal delivery cycle and service charge for each temperature-layer food by 
maximizing the profit of the carrier. 
This study assumes delivery cycles for different rˆ  temperature-layer food to be 
the demarcations of period segments, and divides the entire study period into m  
segments, which are the delivery cycles in this study. Before calculating the costs of 
carriers, the dispatching time for each food i  ordered by retailer j  at time t , tsijy , 
should be decided, and the food can only be dispatched at the beginning time for one 
of the delivery cycles. The model would decide the optimal dispatching cycle and 
which temperature-layers food should be dispatched at each cycle. If the distribution 
center dispatches food belong to temperature layer r  at the c th delivery cycle, CT , 
then 1=rCd ; otherwise, 0=rCd , where rrmC ˆ...1,...1 == ; i.e., CrCtsij Tdy =  with 
specific r , C . The dispatching time for each batch of food also depends on its 
 10 
and temperature control while waiting for dispatching in the distribution center. For 
the time of stocking, assume each kind of food has its own stocking time; therefore, 
the beginning time for inventory cost calculation is the nearest stocking time of the 
food. Let tfijy  denotes the time that food i  ordered by retailer j  at time t  arrives 
at distribution center, iβ  represents the inventory cost of food i  per unit time, 
which contains cost for storage and temperature control, where the storage cost 
depends on the volume of the food, and cost for temperature control depends on both 
volume and the temperature layer the food belongs to. Hence, the inventory cost can 
be formulated as:

2.2 Penalty cost 
Nowadays, the service alternatives provided by carriers in the real world include 
delivering without the restriction of time-window, delivering within time-window on 
the same day of ordering, and delivering within time-window on the next day of 
ordering. Because food considered in this study is perishable, the study ignores the 
alternative of delivering without time-windows and assumes the carrier only provides 
the service of delivering within the time-window on the same day and the next day of 
ordering, respectively. On the other hand, due to the instable traffic condition in urban 
area, hard time-windows for delivery would not be realistic; on the contrary, carriers 
 12 
those delivery beyond the bound of the time-window [ ]tijtij su , , retailers also set the 
earliest acceptable time, tijU , for early arrival and the latest acceptable time, 
t
ijS , for 
late arrival; i.e. retailers consign their food in the future only when the delivery time 
within [ ]tijtij SU , ; otherwise, the orders would be canceled in the future. 
 The total vehicle routing distance for one-to-many distribution network can be 
estimated by continuous approximation (Daganzo, 1999; Hsu et al., 2007). This study 
calculates total vehicle travel distance and travel time, CT , using continuous 
approximation by Daganzo(1999). Assume the distribution center serves N  
customers, and the average demand amount of each retailers at period C  is CD ; σ  
represents the number of customers per unit area, i.e., σ  represents the demand 
point density;  CL  denotes the average load in a vehicle at period C , thereby the 
average number of retailers served by the same vehicle at period C , CN , can be 
calculated as

The loading/uploading cost in this study is dependent on the number of cold boxes 
and cold cabinets used for delivery. Let CrN τ , CrN Γ  denote the number of cold boxes 
and cold cabinets used for temperature-layer r  food at period C , respectively; 
τδ  
and Γδ represents the loading/uploading cost for a cold box and for a cabinet, 
respectively, then the loading/uploading cost at period C  can be expressed as 
ΓΓ+ rtrt NN δδ ττ . The numbers of cold boxes and cold cabinets are not only dependent 
on the total amount of food but also dependent on the capacity utilizations, which is 
affected by the volume, shape or some characteristics (e.g. breakable) of the food. To 
simplify the model, this study assumes all of food is packed as rectangular and not 
consider other factors affecting capacity utilization, i.e. capacity utilizations for all 
containers are taken into account as constants. Let τα , Γα  denote the capacity 
utilizations of cold boxes and cold cabinets, respectively, then, the constraint related 
to cold boxes and cabinets can be constructed as

carrier, i.e. etpi CCCCTC +++= ; where rp  is the service charge per unit volume 
for layer r . In this study, the service charge for each temperature-layer can be 
classified into two tiers: delivery within the time-window on the same day or on the 
next day of ordering. Because this study focuses on the distribution system in a 
metropolitan, retailers are distributed uniformly in the urban area, and the distances 
from the distribution center to retailers are not different significantly from retailer to 
retailer. Therefore, we assume that the service charge for any temperature-layers is not 
related to travel distance but only related to the temperature-layer. Let 1wrp  and 2wrp  
denote service charges for layer r  food delivered with time-window on the same day 
and the next day of ordering, respectively. Without considering the competition 
between carriers, the lower bounds of service charges can be determined only by the 
cost of delivering the food. Therefore, the constraint related to the charges can be 
constructed as

where tsijy  is defined as Eq.(1); tijQ  denotes the initial demand amount of food i  
ordered by retailer j  at time t ; tijω  is a binary variable, 1=tijω  if retailer j

represents the minimal acceptable released time for retailer j  to sell food i , which 
depends on the category and temperature-layer the food belong to. From Section 2.2, 
( )Ctsij Ty +  is the arrival time that food i  arrives at the retail store j . Let ( )itfijy µ+

 Furthermore, this study generalizes the delivery cycles for multi-temperature 
delivery system as a decision matrix, M ,  
 20 
days, is shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1, the demand time is approximately estimated 
as the middle of time-window, and the figure also shows that there are different peaks 
for different layers. The parameters regarding temperature controlling equipments are 
collected and estimated as Table 2. Because the goods consigned in the case are all 
food, the retailers are most restaurants or retail stores which provide convenience food, 
and the demand peak for most layers appear before lunch and dinner time. For the 
differences between five layers, layer 3 has the most demand amount because this 
layer contains the majority of perishable food in the example; the demand of layer 1, 
which only contains sashimi, is most centralized due to its shortest shelf life cycle and 
the reason that it is affected by temperature much more than other food. For other 
parameters related to the distribution center, the fixed cost per vehicle is 500NT$, the 
variable cost is 0.8 NT$/km, the capacity per vehicle is 2000L. The service area of the 
distribution center is 1000 square kilometers; the expected distance between 
distribution center and retailers is 16 kilometers and the average speed of vehicles is 
50 kilometers per hour, with lead time of one hour before dispatching; and the times 
to dispatch are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, clocks on the first day of the study period, and the 
same times on the second day, which are denoted as 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48.

In order to calculate the upper and lower bounds of acceptable service charge for 
each temperature-layer, the study collect all data related to released time, expected 
profit and other costs for all of retailers. To maximize the profit, the carrier should 
choose the upper bounds of acceptable shipping charges to be the optimal scheme. For 
the different tiers of delivery service, i.e., delivery within time-window on the same 
day or the next day of ordering, this study assumes the charges for the latter is 0.8 
times the former, the results are shown as Table 3. This study does not consider the 
competition between carriers, for this reason, the charges in Table 3 may be a little 
higher than service charges in the real world. With the optimal service charges, the 
optimal delivery cycle for each temperature-layer can be solved and shown as the 
decision matrix in Table 4. The revenue for each layer in each period using the

 For the structure of the total cost with the optimal strategy in Table 5, among all, 
transportation cost is the largest part, which accounts for 39% of the total cost and 
follows by the inventory cost (32%) and energy cost (29%). Among the transportation 
cost, the variable cost, which depends on routing distance and oil price, take the most 
percentage, therefore, the carrier should decide the delivery cycles and the location of 
the distribution center carefully so as to reduce transportation cost and maintain 
service level at the same time. If the total routing distance can be decreased, not only 
the transportation cost can be reduced, but the energy cost for controlling temperature 
in transit process can be saved alike. Notably, the delivery cycles of multi-temperature 
joint distribution are the key factors affecting both routing distance and total cost, 
which further markedly influence the profit of carrier.

scale and density of population, there are quite different from country to country. 
Therefore, this study further performs sensitivity analyses regarding the demand point 
density, i.e., the density of retailers in the city, to discuss its effects. The results of 
sensitivity analyses are shown in Figure 3. The figure shows that the changes in profit 
and costs as demand point density increases but total shipping amount maintains the 
same. The figure also shows that the costs which are not related to vehicle travel 
distance directly, such as inventory cost, loading/uploading cost and fixed 
 28 
Table 7 shows the profit, costs and equipments needed for two conditions; in the 
first condition, the demand patterns for all layers are different, each layer has its own 
delivery demand peak and the dispatched amount are dispersed in many periods, as 
shown in Figure 4 (a). In such a condition, the results show that the amounts of 
vehicles and equipment needed in dispatching periods are similar. On the contrary, all 
temperature-layers have the same delivery demand patterns in the second condition 
shown in Figure 4 (b), while the shipping amounts are massed at a few periods. And 
the results show that amounts of vehicles, cold boxes and cabinets in such few periods 
are much larger than other periods, therefore, the carrier has to prepare more vehicles 
and equipments for these few periods. However, these vehicles and equipments would 
be idle in most other periods. For this reason, the carriers should analyze the 
difference of time-dependent characteristics between layers and find out the delivery 
demand peak period for each temperature-layer before planning operation strategies. 
If the peak periods are similar for most layers, the considerable large dispatched 
amount at these periods would make the equipments usage much different from 
period to period, in such condition, the carrier might consider setting an upper bound 
for total dispatched amount for each period and refusing the exceeded consignment.

4 Conclusions 
Recent studies related to temperature-controlled food logistics are most on the 
food quality decay issue due to temperature changing in the cold chain; this study 
aims to formulate a mathematical programming model to solve the optimal delivery 
 32 
This study can be extended in several ways, in the demand side, this study focuses 
on urban areas, which are distributed with fresh food retailers uniformly; future 
studies may discuss regions featured with urban and rural areas alike. In the supply 
side, this study does not consider the competition between carriers, but such 
competition would affect the service charge and shipping amount for each 
temperature-layer; future study may take it into account and analyze the results more 
deeply.

a public transit system.  Unreliability exists when real vehicle arrival and departure 
times are different from the scheduled timetable. Travelers may become anxious and 
unsatisfied if there exists schedule delay, resulting in a decreased intention toward 
public transit system. Dynamic information that provides travelers with timely and 
useful information may increase the awareness of available activity and transit service 
and reduce the uncertainty on the use of transit service and activities around the transit 
terminal. In other words, travelers may use their waiting time more productively by 
participating in available activities, and/or choosing an alternative mode of 
transportation. As a result, the dynamic information can ease passengers’ anxiety 
while waiting for the train or bus at the terminal and further help travelers in making 
travel and activity decisions.  Such dynamic information increases not only the 
service level of public transit system but also the market opportunities of activities 
around these terminals in which travelers are induced to participate in. Moreover, 
travelers with dynamic information on their travel-activity process are possible to 
change their prescheduled activities as well as transportation decisions during the 
travel-activity process. It is important to investigate how travelers’ behavior is 
influenced by such dynamic information provision and what important factors 
affecting their decisions on travel and induced demand for terminal surrounding 
activities.  
Dynamic information plays a significant role in influencing the travel decisions 
of travelers. The use of information to influence travel decisions has been investigated 
in several fields of research, including mode choice, route and departure time choice 
problems. Past studies have investigated individual travelers’ behavior with dynamic 
information provision and focused mainly on travel aspects (e.g., Abdel-Aty, et al., 
1997; Jou, 2001; Kenyon and Lyons, 2003).  Vaughn et al. (1993) developed an 
interactive experiment to investigate drivers’ learning and pre-trip route choice 
behavior under ATIS. Hickman and Wilson (1995) studied the value of information in 
terms of improved route choice. Abdel-Aty et al. (1997) employed two stated 
preference survey techniques to analyze the impacts of traffic information on 
commuters’ route choice. The results showed there exist the significance of traffic 
information and the potential effect of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) 
on travelers’ route choices. Mahmassani and Liu (1999) focused on the day-to-day 
dynamics of commuters’ departure time and route decision process in response to 
ATIS. Jou (2001) formulated a joint model to deal with both route and departure time 
decisions with and without pre-trip information. Ettema and van de Horst (2005) 
conducted an internet survey to investigate travel information acquisition and mode 
choice decisions. The results showed that younger travelers were more likely to 
retrieve any kind of information than older travelers. Ettema and Timmermans (2006)

interviewing intercity travelers in Taipei Main Railway Terminals. Moreover, a nested 
logit model is employed to identify important factors influencing travel and activity 
choices. The stated preference experiment and discrete choice modeling are described 
as follows.  
2.1 Stated Preference Experiment 
Stated preference methods are commonly used in marketing in the early periods. 
During the last several decades, stated preference methods have been widely applied 
to the transport choice problems, such as departure time choice problems (Hunt and 
Patterson, 1996), and mode choice problems (e.g. Morikawa, et al., 1991; Norojono 
and Young, 2003).  Stated preference methods are used to allow the assessment of 
market response to new facilities or new services and to provide demand prediction 
for these new concepts.  Stated preference data are collected in experimental 
situations where respondents are presented with hypothetical choice alternatives and 
state their preferred choices. A stated preference experiment can be designed such that 
each attribute contains more variations than the data in the real world thereby 
identifying the impacts of key explanatory variables on the optimal choice.   
In Taiwan, dynamic information system is still in development and that provides 
travelers with timely information about traffic; however, information about 
surrounding socioeconomic activities is not included yet.  Because of activity 
information wasn’t implemented in Taiwan, travelers have no experience or have little 
knowledge about it. Therefore, the stated preference experiment is suitable and 
employed in the study. The study designs the questionnaire with a stated preference 
survey to collect data on travelers’ socio-demographic and trip characteristics as well 
as their choice preferences. 
After travelers received and assessed the dynamic information, their scheduled 
travel decisions may either remain or be changed. Based on activity participation, 
travelers can be classified into two categories: (1) those who participate in unplanned 
terminal-surrounding activities and (2) those who do not participate in such activities. 
Once travelers decide to participate in unplanned activities, their original departure 
time and/or mode choices might be changed, depending on the scheduled delay and 
the time duration of activity participation. On the other hand, travelers may make 
efficient use of waiting time and participate in the activity only during the waiting 
time period.  In such circumstance, the original departure time and mode choice will 
remain the same as the scheduled.   
Considering decisions regarding whether to change departure time and mode 
choices, there are three alternatives for travelers who participate in unplanned and 
additional activities, such as (1) maintain original mode and departure time; (2) 
maintain the original mode but depart at later time; and (3) shift to alternative mode

The complete factorial involves 37 (=6561) combinations in order to estimate all 
the possible effects. The study uses an orthogonal fractional design to reduce the 
number of combinations while also preserves the richness of the information in the 
design. The number of combinations in the choice set is therefore from 6561 down to 
18. Each respondent was randomly assigned 2 alternatives from all alternatives in the 
choice set.  
2.2 Activity and Travel Choice Model 
Discrete choice analysis is used to model the choice of one among a set of 
mutually exclusive alternatives based on the principle of utility maximization.  An 
individual is assumed to compare the alternatives in terms of a set of attributes and 
choose the alternative yielding the highest level of utility. Let niU  represent the total 
utility of traveler n when choosing alternative i with dynamic information provision. 
Furthermore, ninini VU ε+= , where niV  denotes the deterministic component, and 
niε  denotes a random utility component representing the unobservable or 
immeasurable factors of niU . Supposing that all niε  are independent and identically 
distributed as a Gumbel distribution, the probability of the outcome can be given by 
the logit model. 
The idea of the nested logit model lies in the grouping of similar alternatives into 
nests, creating a hierarchical structure of the alternatives (Ben-Akiva and Lerman

The probability of choosing a combination of participating in terminal surrounding 
activities and altering departure time or mode can be expressed as:

The values of parameters are estimated based on maximum likelihood method. 
The nested logit model is consistent with utility maximization if the condition 
110 ≤<
aμ , is satisfied for all aμ . The value of the inclusive parameter aμ
1  
associated with a nest must be ranging from 0 to 1, indicating that travel decision 
alternatives in that nest share a common unobserved (or error) component.  If the 
value of 
aμ
1  is equal to 1 for all a, the nested logit model is equivalent to the joint 
multinomial logit model, which implies that the choices of travel decision and induced 
demand for terminal surrounding activity can be considered jointly. 
3. Empirical Analysis 
The questionnaire consists of three parts. In the first part, travelers were asked 
several questions about their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as 
gender, marital status, age, occupation, education and income, etc. In the second part 
of the questionnaire, travelers’ trip characteristics are investigated. The respondents 
were asked for answering their mode choice, trip purpose, trip urgency, waiting time 
at the terminal, and scheduled arrival time at the destination, etc.  These questions 
served to focus respondents’ attention on the issues of scheduling and help them start 
to think about their preferences. The third part of the questionnaire focuses on the 
stated preference experiment, which concentrated on identifying travelers’ travel and

range NT$ 20,000-40,000.

Table 3 shows the trip characteristics of the survey. As shown in Table 3, the 
percentage of trip purposes being return home, work related, leisure, visiting friends 
or relatives, and others are 46.9, 25.6, 12.3, 9 and 6.2 respectively. About 24 percent 
of the trips are labeled as urgent trip. Overall, a high percentage of respondents, i.e. 
66.4 percent are shown as having the tendency towards adopting dynamic information 
and participating in terminal surrounding activities. The distribution of choices of the 
six alternatives is shown in Table 4.

Total  211 32.6 
As shown in Table 4, the majority of respondents, i.e. 67.3 percent, will choose 
to participate in terminal surrounding activity when dynamic information is provided. 
The results imply that with the provision of dynamic information, travelers are 
encouraged to engage in terminal surrounding activities.  A high percentage of the 
respondents, i.e. 41 percent prefer to preserve the original travel decision, such as 
departure time and mode choice, while use the waiting time efficiently to participate 
in surrounding activities. About 26 percent of the respondents will alter the original 
transportation decisions in order to spend more time in induced activities.  Among 
 12
As shown in Table 5, the value of a goodness-of-fit index is 0.32637, indicating a 
good explanatory power of the model. The inclusive value parameter for induced 
activity decisions branch is estimated as the reciprocal of the scaling parameter of 
induced activity branch, i.e. 
1666.1
1 =0.8572 and for without induced activity 
decisions branch is 0.5710.  
The generic variables in the study include travel time, travel cost, increased and 
decreased time for destination activity. As shown in Table 5, the values of parameters 
for travel time and travel cost are negative, i.e. –0.0714 and –0.0528.  The travel 
time and travel cost variables are considered as disutility. That is, the travel cost or 
travel time of an alternative increase, the intention of the travelers toward that 
alternative will be decreased. As shown in Table 5, the parameters of increased and 
decreased time for destination activities are with different values, i.e. 0.0171 
and –0.0327. The results imply that there exist different influences of increased and 
decreased time on travelers’ choice.  The decreased time for destination activity 
impacts more on travelers’ choice than the increased time does.  The result implies 
that travelers emphasize more on late arrival at the destination. The positive sign of 
the parameter of increased time for destination activity variable implies that the 
dynamic information could help travelers develop more efficient travel decisions on 
increasing time spent on destination activities. The alternatives of changing departure 
time and mode decision usually results in an earlier arrival at the destination under the 
provision of dynamic information. On the contrary, terminal surrounding activity 
participation may result in late arrival at the destination, and furthermore, a decreased 
time in engaging in destination activities.  
As shown in Table 5, the value of the parameter of activity time is 0.0195. A 
positive coefficient for activity time implies that an increased activity time leads to an 
increased utility and attracts the use of the alternatives with induced activities. 
However, though the utility of the travelers may be increased due to participation of 
terminal surrounding activities, the utility will be decreased as long as there is late 
arrival at the destination. 
Information adoption variables are alternative specific variables for alternative 1, 
2, and 3.  Adopting information variable is a dummy variable. As shown in Table 5, 
the parameters are of positive signs.  A positive coefficient for adopting dynamic 
activity information implies that an increased use of dynamic activity information 
promotes and induces travelers to participate in terminal surrounding activities. The 
findings support that the provision of dynamic information increases travelers’ 
awareness of available activity on making use of transit service and activities around 
the transit terminal. Among alternatives 1, 2 and 3, alternative 2 is characterized as 
 14
destination activities. The alternatives of changing departure time and mode decision 
usually results in an earlier arrival at the destination under the provision of dynamic 
information. On the contrary, terminal surrounding activity participation may result in 
late arrival at the destination, and furthermore, a decreased time in engaging in 
destination activities. 
The result from a positive coefficient for adopting dynamic activity information 
implies that an increased use of dynamic activity information promotes and induces 
travelers to participate in terminal surrounding activities. The findings support that the 
provision of dynamic information increases travelers’ awareness of available activity 
on making use of transit service and activities around the transit terminal. The results 
also imply that engaging in additional activities make travelers adjust their scheduled 
and original travel decisions. The results also show that when adopting dynamic 
activity information, male travelers are more likely to preserve their original departure 
time and mode choice decisions and make use of waiting time effectively to 
participate in surrounding activities. High income travelers are less sensitive to higher 
travel cost; the results imply that these travelers shift to faster higher-price mode so as 
to save travel time for participating in induced activity. In sum, this study has shown 
how travelers’ behavior is influenced by dynamic information provision and what 
important factors affecting their decisions on travel and induced demand for terminal 
surrounding activities.

optimal temperature control to maintain cargoes’ original value and quality in an 
efficient and cost-saving manner.  In 1980, the Yamato Transport Company in Japan 
was the first to provide the service of distributing goods to individual houses, which 
was known as door-to-door parcel delivery.  Nowadays, door-to-door delivery 
service has become a basic distribution mode in Japan. It has created business 
opportunities amounting to more than NTD 200 billion for Japanese logistics 
operators, and has also been gradually adopted by logistics service providers all over 
the world.  For example, Taiwan introduced door-to-door delivery service in 2000 
with the turnover of that year amounted to NTD 20 million, then in 2001, the turnover 
enormously increased 40 times to about NTD 800 million. It has shown dramatic 
growth every year onwards, indicating that door-to-door delivery service has great 
potential and is full of unlimited opportunities. According to the survey results of the 
Economics and Resource Center, Industrial Technology Research Institute (Kuoa, 
2004), Taiwan’s low-temperature market turnover exceeded NTD 200 billion in 2000.  
Meanwhile, a survey on American consumer behavior towards frozen food by  
American Frozen Food Institute and Frozen Food Time Magazine in 1999 showed 
that the sales of frozen food have been increased by 20% in the recent decade.  
Moreover, the sales of frozen food in most nations have shown a significant growth 
tendency in the last few years. Food products for delivery will therefore move toward 
the trend featured with a variety of categories, small shipments and 
multi-temperatures.  All of these will facilitate the development of the 
less-than-truck load transportation industry and multi-temperature logistics. 
 
Kuo (2002) and Kuoa, b(2004) classified current multi-temperature logistics 
techniques into two distribution approaches.  One is the single-temperature 
distribution method, i.e. a single type of vehicle transports cargoes of one temperature 
range only and represents the traditional multi-vehicle distribution technique. The 
other one is the multi-temperature joint distribution approach by which each vehicle 
can simultaneously transport multi-temperature cargoes and can be further classified 
into three types. These are the mechanical refrigerated compartment division 
 4
because cargo-handling, loading, and unloading at terminals using such a distribution 
method is relatively simple. 
 
b. Mechanical refrigerated compartment division multi-temperature joint 
distribution technique 
 
This is currently the most commonly used multi-temperature joint distribution method 
among all and is often combined with the above traditional multi-vehicle distribution 
technique. It adopts the traditional multi-vehicle distribution technique to transport 
cargoes on routes between hubs and applies the mechanical refrigerated compartment 
division multi-temperature joint distribution technique on those between hubs and 
customers.  The latter distribution technique refers to the division of one single 
vehicle compartment into different zones of regular, refrigerated, and frozen 
temperatures.  There is no flexibility among the zones, which may easily result in a 
waste of carrying capacity. Similar to the traditional multi-temperature distribution 
technique, the three-compartment refrigerated vehicles maintain the required 
temperature by a mechanical compression refrigeration unit driven by an engine. The 
purchase costs of vehicles are 1.5 times more expensive than regular ones, and the 
refrigeration unit also has a shorter service lifetime. Temperature control and cargo 
quality are also significantly affected by the vehicle’s environment and the frequency 
and duration of vehicle door opening. 
 
The traditional multi-vehicle distribution technique and mechanical refrigerated 
compartment division multi-temperature joint distribution technique all need frozen, 
refrigerated, and regular warehouses in terminals. Hence, there are no problems of 
dual-invested facilities on intermediate terminals. Instead, due to common use, the 
two combined techniques enable terminal storage investment to yield scale economy 
benefits. In addition, this technique involves low labor, facilities, and time since the 
cargo-handling, loading, and unloading in terminals using such a combined 
distribution method is relatively simple.

of different temperatures and sizes in the standardized cold insulated boxes and 
cabinets to maintain the precise temperature required for storing various cargoes. 
Meanwhile, cold insulated boxes and cabinets accumulate cold through freezers 
installed in the terminal. This technique enables carriers to use regular vehicles to 
deliver multi-temperature cargoes. It also has many advantages such as good 
compartment utilization, flexibility, excellent temperature and quality control for 
cargoes distributed, low equipment purchase cost, long service-life, and 
environmental friendliness.  On the other hand, there are also disadvantages 
including no apparent scale economies and moderate cargo–handling expenses. 
 
Table 1 shows the four techniques described above regarding their technological 
features, vehicle types and equipments, and the comparisons of their advantages and 
disadvantages. From the comparisons made, we can see that the refrigerated cold 
accumulation and insulating cabinet multi-temperature joint distribution technique 
and the replaceable cold accumulating and insulating box multi-temperature joint 
distribution technique have high similarities in practical operations.  Notably, the   
latter is the latest multi-temperature technique among the four, in a way of eliminating 
the defects and enhancing the advantages of the former. Thus, this study focuses only 
on the discussions of the three types of multi-temperature logistics techniques, namely, 
the traditional multi-vehicle distribution technique, the mechanical refrigerated 
compartment division multi-temperature joint distribution technique, and the 
replaceable cold accumulating and insulating box multi-temperature joint distribution 
technique. 
 
There is little academic literature related to the issues on multi-temperature logistics 
so far. Cho and Li (2005) conducted a study on a multi-temperature storage box 
vehicle routing problem (MSBVRP) based on applying the replaceable cold 
accumulating and insulating box multi-temperature joint distribution technique. The 
study shows that its solution is more complicated than traditional VRP, while yielding 
a lower routing cost as compared to the traditional multi-vehicle distribution

maintenance of corneas for transplantation using an experimental group and a 
comparison group. They compared the test results between an existing system and an 
improved system and found that the improved system was more effective in keeping 
the quality of corneas for transplantation and verified that it is very important to 
control the temperature of corneas for transplantation during transportation. Hsu et al. 
(2007) took the perishable features of fresh products into consideration, combined the 
products’ perishing cost with other transportation and energy costs, and then 
constructed a model on a vehicle routing problem with time-windows for perishable 
food delivery.  Their results showed that it could yield a robust result of lowering the 
total delivery cost in light of incorporating the fresh food characteristics and dynamic 
traffic and temperature of actual delivery environment into modeling. 
 
As discussed earlier, there is really only a few past studies related to the in-depth 
analysis and discussion of multi-temperature logistics. In addition, cargo distribution 
nowadays is moving towards the direction that features delivering shipments with a 
variety of categories, small amount and multi-temperature.  Thus, studies aimed on 
the above relevant topics will make contributions not only for academic but also from 
the practical perspective. Literature related to perishable commodities often classifies 
low-temperature commodities and fresh products as perishable commodities. Topics 
regarding quality degradation of this type of commodities over time have been studied 
since the 1960s.  Recent studies have successively proven that, aside from time, the 
quality of perishable commodities is also closely related to temperature. Furthermore, 
the products’ perishable features influence the appropriateness of delivery strategy. 
New techniques such as the replaceable cold accumulation and insulation box 
multi-temperature joint distribution technique described above will not only provide 
better temperature control, but also reduce the influence of time and temperature on 
cargo quality. Thus, taking the new technology into consideration and analyzing its 
application possibilities and impacts has become an important issue. Recently 
multi-temperature logistics techniques have more diversified alternatives, giving more 
options for freight operators to choose what is best for their shipping service.

II. The binary integer programming model  
 
The operation networks could be classified into Line-haul Operation and Local 
Service networks. Present logistics operators commonly divide the entire distribution 
region into several clusters. Inside each cluster, there are several centers and one hub. 
The hub is responsible for collecting and distributing all cargos from/to the centers 
inside each cluster. And centers are the mediums between the operator and customers 
and are mainly responsible for collecting and distributing cargoes from/to customers. 
The transportation service between the centers and the customer ends belongs to the 
local service network and is not included in this study. This study focuses only on the 
discussion of the Line-haul Operation Network, which is similar to the hierarchical 
hub and spoke network.  Figure 1 illustrates the hierarchical hub and spoke network, 
which is used as the basis for constructing the binary integer programming model in 
this study.  
 
Based on the work by Bryan and O’Kelly (1999), the Hub and Spoke (H/S) network 
can be classified according to the types of assignment: the assignment of a single hub 
and the assignment of multiple hubs. For the assignment of a single hub, any node 
(excluding the transit node) inside one H/S network structure, which intends to 
connect with other nodes, can connect via one specific transit node (hub) at most. The 
assignment of multiple hubs is quite similar to the assignment of a single hub. The 
only difference is that its node can be assigned to more than two transit nodes. Thus, 
the hierarchal H/S network is classified into the assignment of a single hub H/S 
network system. In this network structure, a center can only be assigned to one hub. 
Each center has a hub to which it can assign. The entire Operations Network focuses 
on the hub and is divided into several clusters. Each cluster has one hub. The paths 
inside the cluster are called the secondary trunk line. The secondary trunk line 
connects each center and the hub to which it belongs. The secondary trunk line has a 
unidirectional loading or unloading feature (Current, 1986, 1988; Lin, 2001; Lin and 
 12
yet the average fixed cost per unit cargo decreases for the full load of vehicle capacity, 
thereby resulting in economies in vehicle size. The sizes and types of vehicles can 
directly influence the choice of terminal techniques. Therefore, this study develops a 
solving framework to simplify the problem and incorporate this effect into the model. 
First, the study focuses on constructing a binary integer programming model by 
minimizing the terminal transportation and cargo-handling costs to determine the 
multi-temperature logistics techniques and cargo handling quantities for terminals. 
The second is to relax integer constraints based on results from the first one in order 
to develop an algorithm to determine the vehicle transportation cost and vehicle 
routing operations. Then, the following combines the results of the model and the 
algorithm to search the appropriate technique(s) for each terminal and vehicle routing 
operations according to the Branch and Bound method under the “the best, the first 
search” principle. By such an approach, the model not only is featured with 
economies of vehicle size but can also be solved within a polynomial time. Table 2 
describes the symbols and definitions of parameters and decision variables used in the 
binary integer programming model developed in this study.   
 
The binary integer programming model aims to minimize the total cargo handling cost
（ TC ）, terminal setup cost and operating cost per day（ SC ）.  The cargo handling 
cost for cargoes delivered to/from the centers, and to/from the hubs are calculated, 
respectively, due to the different types of multi-temperature logistics techniques used, 
as shown in Equation(1).

The constraints of the binary integer programming model constructed in this study are 
shown in Equations (3)-(15). The bottleneck along the vehicle path must appear in the 
flow to or from the terminal where the vehicle path has passed because in the 
hierarchical hub-and-spoke network, unidirectional loading and unloading are adopted 
along the secondary path. Equations (3) and (4) are the constraints for the terminal 
adopting 2 ,1t  that the actual transportation volume of each temperature-zone 
cargo must be less than the capacity provided by vehicles suitable for the cargo of that 
temperature range. For example, if one vehicle path delivers frozen cargoes with 
technique 2t , then this path must take the total available capacity of refrigerated 
space in three-compartment refrigerated vehicles in one day as its upper limit of 
actual delivery volume. Equations (5) and (6) are constraints that the volume of 
all-temperature cargoes actually delivered by technique 3t  must be less than the 
daily available capacity of regular vehicles using that technique. This constraint can 
reflect that technique 3t  using regular vehicles has greater flexibility in space use 
than techniques 2 ,1t . Since its primary path allows loading/unloading operations 
at the same time along the path, therefore, the bottleneck of transportation capacity 
along the vehicle path must appear in the flow on the link where the vehicle path has 
passed. Equations (7) and (8) are constraints on capacity regarding the fact that actual 
shipping volumes by means of techniques 2 ,1t , and 3t  must be less than the 
capacity that vehicles can handle each day. Equations (9) and (10) address the 
situation for centers and hubs adopting techniques 2 ,1t  that the service capacity 
of cargo handling provided by terminal operators must be greater than the actual 
volumes of refrigerated and frozen cargoes handled in terminals. Equation (11) 
describes the constraint that when the terminal adopts techniques 2 ,1t , it can 
provide at most one cargo service capacity due to its high set-up sunk cost. Equation

III. Vehicle Cost Algorithm  
 
The vehicle transportation cost increases while the average transportation cost per unit 
cargo decreases with the size of the vehicle. However, as long as the cargo shipping 
demand and frequency can be met, operators are likely to choose a small vehicle to 
maximize load factor while minimizing vehicle transportation cost.  Figure 2 
illustrates the relationship between the vehicle purchase and operating cost and the 
maximum cargo volume loaded by the vehicle each day. That is, when the maximum 
cargo volume that the vehicle has ever loaded for one day is small, the operator will 
choose the smallest vehicle to maximize load factor and shipping frequency and to 
minimize cost as long as the demand can be accommodated. However, when it 
exceeds the specific vehicle size with the most intensive frequency that this path can 
provide (a and b points), it will shift to operate with larger vehicles. Once it has 
changed to larger vehicles, it will serve with less frequency. Afterwards, the frequency 
could be changed as the demand grows. The vehicle size will then be changed until 
the capacity provided by the largest vehicle and the most intensive frequency (c point) 
cannot meet the demand. At this situation, the operator must use another vehicle path 
to provide the service. The minimized cost as shown by the solid line in Figure 2 is 
the line comprised of several cost line segments of various vehicle sizes.  
 
Furthermore, the vehicle operating cost is related to the length of the vehicle path, i.e., 
the longer the path is; the higher the operating cost will be. The number of vehicles 
required should also be increased to meet the shipping frequency for the longer truck 
 18
Different techniques will directly influence the vehicle type adopted. When the 
terminal operates with technique 1t , frozen, refrigerated, and regular vehicles 
could all be used. However, each type of vehicle is suitable for carrying only cargoes 
of a specific temperature range. On the other hand, if the terminal operates with 
technique 2t , it can only use three-compartment refrigerated vehicles, and if the 
terminal operates with technique 3t , only regular vehicles are required. Hence, 
when the terminal simultaneously operates with techniques 2 ,1t , it can transport 
cargoes in a way of loading frozen, refrigerated, regular cargoes, separately, into 
different vehicles and/or loading the mixed cargoes of three temperature ranges into 
three-compartment refrigerated vehicles. When the terminal operates with technique 
3t , it could transport the mixed cargoes of multi-temperature ranges.  
 
Moreover, different techniques will also influence the cargo volume actually loaded 
into a vehicle, namely, vehicle capacity availability.  The vehicles of 1t  have the 
highest availability, followed by 2t  and 3t . The capacity availability of 3t  
is the lowest among the three due to requiring the extra temperature-controlled box 
and/or cabinet. However, in actual operation, different resulting load factors could be 
obtained due to the flexibility of different techniques in space utilization and the 
composition of different temperature cargoes.  As a result, load factor becomes one 
of key factors that actually influence the vehicle transportation cost.  
 
For 2t , for example, suppose the capacity allocation of the vehicle for frozen, 
refrigerated, and regular compartments (three temperature ranges) is based on the 
ratio of 1:1:2. Then, when the ratio of maximum cargo volumes of these three 
temperature ranges is 0.8:1:1.2, the vehicle size is still based on the volume of 
refrigerated cargo rather than those of frozen or regular cargoes.  As a result, this 
measure will easily cause a waste of space in frozen and regular compartments. This 
study set three ratios of 1:1:2, 1:2:3, and 1:2:4 for t=2 vehicle compartment and 
selects the eight cases shown in the example section for testing. The result indicates 
that over 60% of test cases could obtain the lowest total delivery cost under the 
 20
When the values of all variables related to cargo volumes to/from the terminal are 0, 
the calculation is completed and proceed to the next step. Otherwise, return to step 3.  
 
Step 6. Output some results.  
Output vehicle costs along the primary trunk line and the secondary line in the cluster 
and other relevant results including the sizes, types, and paths of the vehicle fleet. 
 
Step 7. Check whether the calculation on all clusters is complete or not.  
When calculation has been done on all clusters, move to the next step. Otherwise, 
return to step 1 and conduct calculations regarding the secondary trunk line in another 
cluster.  
 
Step 8. Output all results. 
Output vehicle costs on the secondary trunk lines in all clusters and those along the 
primary trunk line and other relevant results including the sizes, types, and paths of 
the vehicle fleet.  
 
Finally, the study focuses on solving the binary integer programming model in a way 
of combining the algorithm results with the Branch and Bound method under the 
principle of “the best, the first search.”  Using this approach, the study can reflect the 
economies scale of vehicle size, i.e., when the demand is large enough, the operator 
will choose large possible vehicles for transportation. This study also reflects the 
features of using technique 2t , i.e. vehicles with three-temperature compartments 
can deliver three-temperature cargoes at the same time but the utilization of 
compartment space cannot be shared between various temperature cargoes, thereby 
reducing flexibility.  If the volumes of different temperature cargoes transported on 
the bottleneck of the route apparently deviates from the ratio of 1:1:2 for frozen, 
refrigerated, and regular cargoes, it will cause a waste of space and cost. This result is 
often not favored under the principle of “the best, the first search”, because high cost 
result will be terminated easier than low cost result. Furthermore, the sizes and types 
 22
different requirements on refrigeration and frozen equipment, therefore even when 
both handle the same amount of volume, their initial investments on equipments will 
be different.  
 
Since the effectiveness of refrigeration and frozen of technology 3t  can meet high 
standard requirements, the initial investment costs therefore do not differ because of 
different hubs and centers. The values of cost parameters of technology 3t  are 
based on the data and formula provided by the Industrial Technology Research 
Institute, Energy and Resource Laboratory. That is, one 180-liter heat-insulated box 
costs NTD 9,000, which needs five refrigeration (frozen) cold accumulators (eutectic 
plate), each of which costs NTD 500. The annual maintenance cost of such equipment 
is about 3% of its setup cost, and the lifespan is about 10 years. The study then 
estimated that the operator must pay NTD 4.24 per heat-insulated box per day for 
purchase and maintenance of the heat-insulated box and cold accumulator. The 
refrigeration (frozen) cold accumulator needs freezers for cold accumulation. Each 
freezer costs NTD 380,000 and can accumulate the cold for 235 cold accumulators. 
Thus, each freezer can support the cold accumulators of 47 heat-insulated boxes. An 
adequate supply of cold accumulators is the quantity necessary for heat-insulated 
boxes used for the total flows of refrigerated and frozen cargoes to and from the 
terminals. The freezers also require refrigerator units, of which the maintenance cost 
is 7% of the purchase cost, and each has a lifespan of six years. The operator must pay 
NTD 4.68 per heat-insulated box per day for the purchase and maintenance of the 
freezer.  With regards to the daily operating cost (electricity fee), the basic monthly 
fee is NTD 1,400 and the electricity rate is NTD 1.7 per Kwh.  Each freezer’s power 
is 10 Kwh, and if it operates for 24 hours a day, the daily operating cost will be NTD 
9.67 per heat-insulated box, or about 52% of the terminal’s total setup cost and 
operating cost. Thus, this study takes in total NTD 18.5 per heat-insulated box per day 
as the parameter value of setup and operating cost for 3t .  
 
Table 4 lists the values of parameters related to the vehicle purchase costs and 
 24
and service areas, such as the line-haul operations network and the local services 
network.  Hence, this study changes the demand volume into 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 
1.5, 1.75, and 2 times the original base values and performs sensitivity analysis. Table 
6 lists the results of sensitivity analysis. As indicated in Table 6, when the demand is 
0.25 times of the original value, all hubs and centers will operate with technique 
3t , but as the demand increases, the advantage of 3t  will gradually disappear. 
As cargo volume continuously increases, the clusters tend to adopt techniques 2 ,1t . 
However, when the cargo volume changes unsteadily, technique 3t  is used due to 
its flexibility.  That is, as the demand increases, techniques 2 ,1t , become the 
mainstream, while technique 3t  evolves into an adjusting and auxiliary role. As to 
the share of technique use, if 0.8 is regarded as the basis to judge whether the 
technique adopted by the terminal is mainstream, we find that 2 ,1t  become the 
mainstream for the hubs in Cluster A and Cluster C when the demand is about 
0.5~0.75 times of that in the original case. And as the demand increases the advantage 
of those techniques will be maintained. Techniques 2 ,1t  will become the 
mainstream for the hub in Cluster B when the demand is about 1.25 times that in the 
original case. In the case that 2 ,1t  becomes the mainstream in centers in each 
cluster, then the hub it belongs to usually has already used 2 ,1t  as the main 
techniques. 
 
Hence, the above results imply that those terminals with small distributing volumes 
and operating under technique 3t  will be with the better strategy than others. On 
the other hand, when the terminal’s distribution volume and size become larger, then 
technique 3t  tends to play the supplementary role to techniques 2 ,1t , which 
become the main ones used.  Nevertheless, when the shipping demand increases over 
time, it is usually difficult to change techniques 2 ,1t , due to their tremendous sunk 
cost and inflexibility once deployed. It is then a good idea to adjust shipping supply 
using technique 3t , which has the advantage of flexibility. 
 
When the shipping demand changes, the cost changes accordingly, including those 
 26
cost changes are too complicated to be represented effectively. Thus, this study 
displays the effects of unit cost changes by calibrating and showing their respective 
values of terminal cost and vehicle cost parameters 2121  , , , bbaa . As shown in Figure 
5, the results of the calibration differ from the actual values with an error of about 5%, 
which indicates that the calibrated functions may represent those results.  
 
For the part of the terminal cost, Figure 5 illustrates that the higher the unit cost of 
technique  3t , the lower the 1b  value will be. This indicates that the feature of 
scale economies becomes more apparent for a higher unit cost of technique 3t . On 
the other hand, the lower the unit cost of technique 3t , the more likely that the 
terminal will adopt technique 3t , thereby lowering terminal cost though it is  
insignificant in scale economies. Figure 5 also shows that the parameter value will 
tend to change slightly as the unit cost continuously decreases, i.e., for technique 
3t , when its unit costs drops by less than 10%, the ratio of technique adoption will 
markedly change. However, when its unit cost further drops from 10% to 15%, there 
are more changes in its adoption ratio due to the advantages of techniques 2 ,1t , 
such as scale economies and high vehicle capacity.  These advantages are apparent 
and not easily replaced in the operation network of large demand volume. On the 
other hand, as the unit cost of technique 3t  increases, its adoption ratio becomes 
steady, i.e., while techniques 2 ,1t  account for the majority of the market. With 
regards to the vehicle cost, the value of 2b  falls between 0.765 and 0.770 which 
indicates that it exhibits scale economies. Moreover, the value of 2a  does not change 
significantly and implies that the vehicle cost will not change significantly with its 
unit cost for technique 3t .  
 
In the example above, the demand ratios of different temperature cargoes in all 
directions of flows are the same, but this may not be the actual situation. Hence, this 
study further assumes that the flow ratio of frozen, refrigerated, and regular cargoes in 
 28
techniques for terminal and vehicle routing operations by minimizing the total 
delivery cost comprised of transportation cost and cargo-handling cost from the 
operator’s viewpoint.  
 
The result indicates that technique 3t  is suitable for the terminals with a small 
shipping volume, dense distribution of terminals, and small size of the operation 
network. Furthermore, when the demand increases over time, it is very difficult to 
change equipment and facilities using techniques 2 ,1t , while technique 3t   
evolves into an adjusting and auxiliary role. Hence, when the operator operates in a 
local service network or competes with a number of operators for the same market, 
the operator would prefer to adopt technique 3t , which is also helpful to change 
over time in response to market demand. Lowering terminal setup and operating cost 
per unit using technique 3t  will increase the adoption ratio. However, when the 
unit cost drops to a certain degree, the ratio change will dramatically slow down. It is 
because of the advantages in scale economies brought by techniques 2 ,1t  are 
higher than those in the space flexibility brought by 3t . On the other hand, as the 
unit cost of technique 3t  increases, its adoption ratio becomes steady, which 
indicates that a higher terminal setup and operating cost per unit using technique 
3t  will gradually loose its advantages. Moreover, when the demand ratio of 
different temperature cargoes in all directions is imbalanced, the operator would 
prefer to use tachniques with flexibility in the use of vehicle delivery space to 
accommodate the difference. In such circumtances, the percentage of terminals using 
technique 3t  is apparently higher, because the space flexibility of regular vehicles 
using technique 3t  is better than that of three-compartment refrigerated vehicles 
using technique 2t .  As a result, technique 3t  is suitable to the operation 
network where demand is not even in the temporal or/and spatial distribution, because 
the cost increase can be well controlled using technique 3t . 
 
In addition, the results of the study related to vehicle cost indeed exhibit the feature of 
scale economies and conform to the expectation in practice and the logic of the
