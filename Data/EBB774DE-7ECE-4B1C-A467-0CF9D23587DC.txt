Abstract—The world has entered the age of digitized 
information. Lots of text, audio and visual information must be 
stored in the form of binary numbers within electronic files. The 
information must be reconstructed into appropriate forms (books, 
music, movies, etc) through various media (printer, monitor, music 
or video player, etc) before being conveyed to the users. Among 
those consumer electronics invented in response to the demand for 
storage and portability of digitized information, printers have 
gradually evolved into indispensable household facilities and the 
related market has become globally competitive. Recently, laser 
printing systems, which build on the technology of 
electrophotography, address the solution for fast and high quality 
printing and stimulate lots of research activities. The project will 
extend the work from previous research, and continue the study of 
topics relevant to accurate spatial image rendition. We will view 
and formulate various problems, which are previously regarded as 
signal/image processing problems, from the aspects of systems and 
control, and develop adequate model-based halftoning algorithms. 
The proposed methods will be verified on a laser printing system. 
Previous research relied on a virtual printer model, which demands 
overly high computational complexity, or on a set of linearized 
models, which is over-simplified. In this study, we seek a nonlinear 
two-dimensional spatial model with input/output relationship 
approximating the virtual printer model established formerly. In 
addition, the required computational complexity is much lower than 
that of using the virtual printer model. Specifically, we will exploit 
the feasibility of building such nonlinear model using fuzzy 
systems or neural networks. The nonlinear spatial model will then 
be incorporated into design of a novel model-based halftoning 
algorithm, and we expect that the print quality will be comparable 
to that when using the virtual printer model. Research results from 
this project will significantly improve the print quality of 
conventional laser printers and the proposed control-oriented 
approaches will also upgrade the technology of industrial design for 
related products. This project also hopes to elevate pertaining 
domestic academic research. We mention that the proposed 
methods are also applicable inkjet printers and other imaging 
systems after modification.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Digital halftoning refers to the process of transforming a 
continuous-tone image into one with a finite number of 
intensities. Using a pattern of pixels with a limited number 
of intensities as the building block, the transformed image 
(so- called halftone image) is perceived as a continuous-tone 
image when seen by the human eye from a distance. The 
success of halftoning is a result of the eye being a spatial 
low-pass filter that blurs the rendered pixel pattern. Digital 
halftoning is often used to manifest continuous-tone images 
in media where direct rendition of the tones is impossible. 
The most common example of such media is ink or toner on 
paper, and the most common rendering devices for such 
media are printers. 
Based on the type of computation involved, halftoning 
algorithms can be classified into three categories (Allebach, 
1999): point algorithms (e.g., screening or dithering), 
neighborhood algorithms (e.g., error diffusion), and iterative 
algorithms (e.g., least squares and direct binary search). 
Point algorithms conduct a pixel-by-pixel comparison with a 
spatially varying threshold to obtain the binary value of the 
halftone image. In neighborhood algorithms, in addition to 
pixel-by-pixel comparison with a threshold to determine the

3. COMPREHENSIVE PRINTER MODEL 
A comprehensive printer model, which integrates the models 
of motor/organic photoconductor subsystem, charging, 
exposure, and development process, will be employed to 
‘print’ the test samples and generate reference output images. 
This model is given by

where ( , )M x y A  is the toner mass per unit image area at 
position ( , )x y ,  ,  sV x y  is the OPC surface potential 
after exposure, tZ  is the toner concentration, dV  is the 
developing roller voltage,   is the speed ratio between the 
developing roller and the OPC, p  is the ratio of the single 
projected area to the total projected area of the carrier on the 
OPC, t  and c  are the toner particle density and the 
carrier particle density, respectively, tR  is the toner particle 
radius, Q M  is the average value of the charge-to-mass 
ratio, and 0  is the permittivity of free space. Readers 
interested in details on derivation and verification of this 
model may refer to (Chen and Weng, 2009) and the 
references therein. 
4. TEST IMAGE DESIGN 
Adopting the concept of conducting system identification 
using sinusoidal signals, two-dimensional spatial-based test 
images Img( , )x y  of 100 100 pixels are designed based 
on the following formula: 
 Img( , ) cos 2 2 yx
ffx y B A x y
DPI DPI
      
 (6) 
where B  is the absorptance of background, A  is the 
amplitude of the sinusoid, xf  is the frequency of the 
sinusoid in x  direction, yf  is the frequency of the 
sinusoid in y  direction, and DPI  is the print resolution 
(set to 600 for this study). Note that the frequency unit is 
cycles/inch. 
Table 1 lists the set of test images with various combinations 
(around two hundred) of background absorptance, sinusoid 
amplitude, and frequencies in x  and y  directions. Fig. 1 
depicts some of the test images, which have been enlarged 
for better visibility.

5. IDENTIFICATION/OPTIMIZATION OF THE WIENER 
PRINTER MODEL 
The main idea for conducting parametric identification or 
optimization of the proposed Wiener model is illustrated in 
Fig. 2. The Wiener model consists of an FIR filter and a 
nonlinear static mapping. Although conventional approaches 
of system identification are available for determining the 
parameters of the nonlinear static mapping of a Wiener 
model, this paper will exploit the feasibility and 
effectiveness of utilizing a fuzzy system as a universal 
approximator. It is expected that the fuzzy system should be 
able to approximate any nonlinear static mapping with high 
degree of nonlinearity.

comparative study is performed (see Fig 8). As first step, a 
set of 15 continuous-tone image samples are transformed 
into halftone images using a typical error diffusion algorithm. 
Next, the halftone images are ‘printed’ using both the 
comprehensive and the Wiener printer models. Third, the 
two groups of ‘printed’ images and the original grayscale 
images are filtered by the HVS model to generate 
‘perceived’ images. Finally, the RMS (root mean square) 
errors described by

are evaluated and summarized in Table 2. The closeness of 
the RMS errors indicates that the identified Wiener model is 
a good approximation of the comprehensive printer model. 
This can be further justified by looking at the image results.

image samples.

6. MODEL-BASED ERROR DIFFUSION 
INCORPORATING THE WIENER PRINTER MODEL 
The identified Wiener model is integrated with an existing 
and widely used halftoning algorithm, i.e., error diffusion, to 
form a new class of model-based halftoning techniques. This 
is illustrated in Fig. 10. Also shown is how to evaluate the 
performance of a specific type of model-based halftoning 
algorithms. The proposed model-based halftoning approach 
is compared with three other approaches, i.e., traditional 
error diffusion (assuming all-pass filter printer model), error 
diffusion with dot overlap printer model, and error diffusion 
with comprehensive printer model. A set of 43 image 
samples are used for this study. The results are summarized 
in Table 3. It is seen that, in all cases excluding samples 11, 
18, and 29, error diffusion based on either the 
comprehensive or the Wiener model performs better than the 
other two conventional approaches. Another observation is 
that, in one quarter of the cases, error diffusion based on the 
Wiener model even outperforms one based on the 
comprehensive model. Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 demonstrate the 
halftone images and printed images corresponding to three 
of the image samples.
