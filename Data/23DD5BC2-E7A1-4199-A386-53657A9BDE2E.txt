1. Architecture effects on the Morphologies of PS-b-P4VP in dilute solutions 
Synthesis and solution morphologies of four new heteroarm star 
polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) were studied. As the water content increased, a 
morphological transformation of heteroarm PS4-P4VP4 from spheres to cylinders, vesicles, and 
large compound vesicles was observed. The morphology of PS4-P4VP4 in the solvent mixture of 
DMF/water or 1,4-dioxane/ water was spherical, but changed to large compound micelles in 
THF/water. As the P4VP molar ratio decreased, the morphology changed from spherical mixed 
with cylindrical to vesicles, giant vesicles, and then to LCMs. The present study demonstrated the 
formation of multiple morphologies through manipulating solvent polarity and block ratio in dilute 
solution. 
 
1-1 Experimental 
Materials 
Styrene (St, Fluka, purity 99%), 4-vinylpyridine (4VP, Acros, purity 97%), and divinylbenzene 
(DVB, Merck, purity 80%) were purchased and distilled from dibutylmagnesium (Aldrich, 1.0 M 
solution in heptane) under reduced pressure. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, Acros, 99.9%) was distilled 
from a mixture of sodium (Aldrich, 30–35 wt.-% dispersion in paraffin wax) and benzophenone 
(Aldrich, 99t%). Sec-butyllithium [sec-BuLi, Acros, 1.3 M in cyclohexane/hexane 92:8] was used 
as received. 
 
Synthesis of PS-b-P4VP 
Synthesis of Linear PS-b-P4VP 
Linear PS-b-P4VP was synthesized by sequential living anionic polymerization. The 
polymerization was carried out in THF at -78 8C using sec-BuLi as the initiator. Reagents with 
specific molar ratios of monomer/initiator (styrene/sec-BuLi=154, 4VP/sec-BuLi=45) were 
introduced to the reactor. Then, PS and P4VP were polymerized in 10 and 60 min, respectively. The 
polymerization was then terminated by an aliquot of methanol and the polymer product was 
precipitated in hexane followed by filtration. The linear diblock copolymer denoted by L1 (yield: 
95%) had a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 21 900 and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 
1.06. The molar ratio of P4VP ( fP4VP) in the neat copolymer was 0.24. 
 
Synthesis of Heteroarm Star PS4-P4VP4 
A three-step sequential copolymerization was used to prepare heteroarm star PS4-P4VP4, as 
illustrated in Scheme 1-1. The synthetic scheme was similar to that of heteroarm star PSn-P2VPn 
reported in our previous publication. Initially, living PS arms were synthesized at _78 8C using 
sec-BuLi as the initiator with the monomer/initiator of 154 (see Table 1-1). These PS arms were 
then joined together in the second step by reaction of the living PSchains with a small amount of 
 4
the Tg attributed to the PS is shown for other copolymers, which is probably due to the low P4VP 
content. The above results of molecular weight analysis, NMR and thermal analysis indicate the 
successful synthesis of PS-b-P4VP on the star copolymers. 
 
Morphological Transformation Induced by Adding Selective Solvent 
Figure 1-3 shows the variation of the DLS hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) distribution of 
PS4-P4VP4 (H2) with the water content in the solvent mixture of water/DMF. Note that the initial 
copolymer concentration was fixed at 0.2 wt.-%. The Dh of the PS4-P4VP4 in 0 (pure DMF) and 
2.8 wt.-% water content are 11.4 and 17.2 nm, respectively. However, it gradually increases to 64.5, 
90.3, 105.2, 121.0, and 154.1 nm as the water content enhances to 5.7, 8.3, 10.9, 13.5, and 16.1 
wt.-%, respectively (Table 1-2). Single molecules or unimers of PS4-P4VP4 are expected at a  
relatively dilute polymer solution below the critical water content (CWC) of micellization, since 
DMF is a good solvent for both blocks. Thus, the detected molecular size (11.4 and 17.2 nm) from 
DLS indicates the formation of unimer in solutions of pure DMF and 2.8 wt.-% of water. 
Subsequently, the much larger Dh at the water content higher than 5.7 wt.-% suggests the formation 
of the multipolymer chain aggregate induced by the selective solvent of water. 
Figure 1-4 shows the variation of the Dh with the water content in the water/DMF mixed solvent 
for the two copolymers, heteroarm star PS4-P4VP4 (H2) and linear PS-b-P4VP (L1). Note that H2 
and L1 have the same P4VP molar ratio of 0.24, as shown in Table 1-1. The CWC for micellization 
estimated from Figure 1-4 is between 2.8 and 5.7 wt.-% for both copolymers since the Dh increases 
sharply in this range. The Dh of L1 is larger than that of H2 as the water content is higher than 5.7 
wt.-% in the solvent mixture (Table 1-2). Besides, the slope of the fitting line of L1 is 1.4 times 
higher than that of H2 in Figure 1-4. It suggests that heteroarm star copolymer of H2 has a smaller 
micelle size and lower tendency of size enlargement than linear counterpart L1. The molecular 
architecture effect on the micelle size could be further explored by the comparison of aggregation 
number (Nagg). Figure 1-5 shows the variation of aggregation number (Nagg) with the water 
content in the solvent mixture, estimated by SLS. Note that the total aggregation number (Nagg) of 
the polymer chains in the micellar complexes was approximately calculated by dividing 
weight-average molecular weight of micelles by single molecules. Thus, Nagg of H2 was 
multiplied by 4.15 since each H2 consisted of 4.15 polymer chains of PS and P4VP, respectively. 
As shown in Figure 1-5, aggregation number (Nagg) of L1 or H2 increases with enhancing the 
water content and the L1 has a higher Nagg than the H2. This result is in a good agreement with 
that from DLS shown in Figure 1-4, which demonstrates the architecture effect on the solution 
micelle size. It suggests that the star polymer has a lower driving force for micellization than the 
linear analog due to the polymer chains attached to the core leading combinatorial entropy loss. 
That is, the heteroarm star copolymers protect their insoluble blocks more easily than the 
corresponding linear copolymers. Similar conclusion was also reported on the micelle of heteroarm 
star PS6-P2VP6 in toluene in comparison with that of linear analog.  
 6
concentration and the water content were fixed at 0.1 and 10.7 wt.-%, respectively. Typical sphere 
morphology with average diameters of 50 and 130 nm are observed in Figure 1-11(A) (DMF/water) 
and 1-11(B) (1,4- dioxane/water), respectively. However, large compound micelles (LCMs) with 
average diameter near 600 nm are observed in Figure 1-11(C) (THF/water). The above variation on 
the micellar size could result from the different degree of solubility of the PS in the above three 
common solvents. Note that the solubility parameter of PS [18.6 (MPa)0.5] is closer to THF [18.6 
(MPa)0.5] than dioxane [20.5 (MPa)0.5] and DMF [24.8 (MPa)0.5]. Hence, the highest aggregated 
size of the PS core in THF is probably due to larger swelling on the PS blocks than those of the 
other two solvents. Besides, increasing aggregated size always accompanies reducing number of 
micelles by the fusion of individual micelles for enlargement. Thus, much less micelle number is 
observed from Figure 1-11(C) than those from Figure 1-11(A) and (B). 
 
Multiple Morphologies of PS4-P4VP4 with Different Block Ratios 
  Figure 1-12 shows the micellar morphologies of PS4-P4VP4 (H1–H4) at a fixed water content of 
13.5 wt.-% in DMF. Note that H1–H4 contain nearly the same PS length but with different f4VP 
molar ratios of 0.37, 0.24, 0.12, and 0.07, respectively. The least asymmetric H1 ( f4VP=0.37) gives 
spherical or cylindrical micelles [Figure 1-12(A)]. As f4VP decreases to 0.24 (H2), the morphology 
changes to vesicles with a diameter of around 110 nm [Figure 1-12(B)]. On further decrease of f4VP 
to 0.12 (H3), giant vesicles with a diameter of 400 nm [Figure 1-12(C)] are observed. The 
spherical solid micelles with a large size disparity [Figure 1-12(D)] are formed for the smallest f4VP 
of 0.07 (H4). The radius of the spherical core increases with decreasing soluble block length at a 
constant insoluble block length, due to an enhanced core stretching. However, the increased core 
stretching lowers the entropy of the core chains and leads to the morphological transition for 
reducing the thermodynamic stretching penalty. It explains the morphological transformation in 
Figure 1-12. The large spheres in Figure 1-12(D) are probably viewed as LCMs formed from 
aggregated reverse micelles, consisting of polar P4VP cores and non-polar PS coronas. The 
interaction between the corona chains and solvent could not stabilize the aggregates for the case of 
very short soluble P4VP blocks ( f4VP of 0.07, H4). Thus, it forms inverse micelles and undergoes a 
secondary aggregation by kinetic control. Consequently, the LCMs are formed from hydrophilic 
surface and composed of reverse micelles inside. The above morphology transformation is 
schematically shown in Figure 1-13. It suggests that the composition, selective solvent content, and 
solvent polarity play important roles on multiple micellar morphologies of heteroarm star block 
copolymers. 
 
1-3 Conclusions 
  In this study, four heteroarm star block copolymers of PS-b-P4VP were successfully synthesized 
and their solution morphologies were characterized. The importance of polymer architecture on 
micellar morphologies (aggregation size, aggregation number, and morphological transformation)

Synthesis of Rod-Coil Diblock PF-b-P2VP Copolymers. 
The synthetic route of diblock PF-b-P2VP is shown in Scheme 2-1 and described below: 
9,9-Dihexyl-2-phenyl-7-(4-Vinylphenyl)-9H-fluorene (3).  
2-bromo-9,9-di-n-hexylfluoreneboronic acid (2) was prepared by monolithiation of 
9,9-dihexyl-2,7-dibromofluorene (1) with 1.1 equiv of n-butyllithium followed by boronation with 
triisopropyl borate at -78 °C, according to the literatures.36 9,9-Dihexyl-2-phenyl- 7-(4- 
vinylphenyl)-9H-fluorene (3) was synthesized by modified Suzuki coupling protocol.37 A 3.0 g 
(6.55 mmol) sample of compound 2, 56 μL (0.542 mmol) of 4-bromostyrene, 80 mg (0.070 mmol) 
of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and 5 drops of Aliquat 336 were reacted in toluene and 
2 M Na2CO3 mixtures under reflux at 80 °C. After heating and stirring vigorously for 24 h, 1.5 
equiv of phenylboronic acid were added as end-capping reagent for bromoside. The resulting 
polymers were precipitated into 500 mL of MeOH, filtered, and dried under vacuum at 45 °C for 36 
h. (Yields: 75%.) 1H NMR (CDCl3), δ (ppm): 7.3-7.9 (10H, ring aromatic protons and phenyl end

protons of end-caps). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC): Mn= 5130, PDI ) 1.83. 
 
Poly[2,7-(9,9-dihexylfluorene)]-block-poly(2-Vinylpyridine) (PF-b-P2VP, di-PFPVP).  
Amphiphilic diblock copolymer of PF-b-P2VP was synthesized by living anionic polymerization, 
similar to that reported in the literature. 150 mg (∼ 0.04 mmol) of PF macroinitiator (3) was dried 
in a reaction flask under high vacuum environment (∼ 10-3 Torr) to remove the residual solvent for 
2 h.Distilled THF via sec-BuLi as purifying agent was transferred to the reaction flask. Excess 
sec-BuLi was then used as initiator and added into the reaction mixtures at -78 °C using a syringe. 
A deep black color is an indication that the vinyl-end capping PF was initiated completely. In order 
to quench the effect of the residual sec-BuLi, the reaction was allowed to warm up to the room 
temperature for 0.5 h. At the same time, the excess sec-BuLi reacted with THF to form ethylene and 
lithium salt. Then, purified 2VPmonomer was added into the reaction flask rapidly at -78 °C and 
polymerized for 1 h. Finally, the polymerization reaction was terminated by adding a small amount

2-2 Results and Discussions 
Polymer Structure Characterization 
The chemical structures of the polymers synthesized were confirmed by 1H NMR and GPC. 
Figure 2-1(A) shows proton signals of the macroinitiator of diblock PF-b-P2VP (di-PFPVP), 
9,9-dihexyl-2-phenyl-7-(4- vinylphenyl)-9H-fluorene (3, in Scheme 2-1) in d-chloroform. The 
proton peaks of the aromatic ring and alkyl group on the PF moiety are shown at 7.3-8.0 and 0.5-2.3 
ppm, respectively. The proton signals on the vinyl moiety of macroinitiator 3 are clearly observed 
in the regions of 5.3, 5.8, and 6.8 ppm, implying the successful incorporation of the end-capper 
4-bromostyrene. The proton peaks of vinyl moieties at 5.3 and 5.8 ppm are completely disappeared 
in the 1H NMR spectrum of di-PFPVP, as showed Figure 2-1(B). In addition, proton signals on the 
pyridine ring of the P2VP moiety are observed at 6.0-7.5 and 8.0-9.0 ppm, respectively. The results 
clearly suggest the successful preparation of diblock PF-b-P2VP (di-PFPVP). The 1H NMR 
spectra of the macroinitiator (9,9-dihexyl-2,7-bis(4- vinylphenyl)-9H-fluorene (4) and triblock 
copolymer, tri- PFPVP, are shown in Figure 2. Vinyl protons at the two chain ends of PF moiety of 
the tri-PFPVP (Figure 2-2(A)) are observed at the similar position as those of di-PFPVP but with 
stronger signal intensities due to its double end-cappers on the PF. The disappearance of the vinyl 
protons and the observation of pyridine ring protons at 6.0-7.5 and 8.0-9.0 ppm in Figure 2-2(B) 
suggest the successful preparation of tri-PFPVP.  
In Figure 2-3, profile a represents the GPC curve of PF macroinitiator (3, in Scheme 2-1). The 
GPC curve of the first addition of the 2VP monomer shifts to a lower retention time (profile b) and 
move further by adding more 2VP (profile c), implying the successful polymerization of the 2VP 
monomer into the PF macroinitiator. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and 
polydispersity (PDI) of di-PFPVP estimated from GPC are 21290 and 1.33, respectively. The 
estimated molar ratio of the PF block is 0.24. The inset of Figure 2-3 shows GPC profiles of the 
tri-PFPVP, which shows a similar shifting with the addition of the 2VP monomer. The Mn and 
PDI of tri-PFPVP estimated from GPC are 16530 and 1.33, respectively. The molar ratio of PF 
segments in the tri-PFPVP is estimated to be 0.28, which is similar to di-PFPVP. The studied two 
copolymers with a similar composition were used to study the architecture effect on solution 
morphology and photophysical properties. Thermal properties of polymers were examined by TGA 
and DSC and shown in the Figure 2-4. In the inset of Figure 2-4, the thermal degradation 
temperatures (Td) (weight loss of 5%) of (a) PF-vinyl macroinitiator (diblock, 3), (b) PF-vinyl 
macroinitiator (triblock, 4), (c) P2VP homopolymer, (d) di-PFPVP, and (e) tri-PFPVP are 
observed at 408, 410, 383, 376, and 392 °C, respectively. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of 
the above five polymers from the DSC curves are found at 79, 80, 97, 97, and 97 °C, respectively. 
The Td and Tg of the two block copolymers are close to the P2VP homopolymer since the molecular 
weight of the P2VP moiety is much larger than that of the PF moiety. 
 
 12
nm are observed, as opposed to the diblock micelles observed in the homologue solutions. By 
further increasing the MeOH/THF ratio to 70/30, micelles with a regular cylindrical shape with 
∼ μm scaled contour length are shown in Figure 2-7(D). Bundles of cylinders are observed in the 
MeOH/ THF ratio of 90/10 as a result of the aggregation of cylindrical micelles (Figure 2-7(E)). 
As discussed above, the system tends to decrease the total interfacial area by increasing the 
micellar radius with increasing selective solvent content. However, core size also increases leading 
to a flattening of the interface with subsequent polymer chain stretching and conformational entropy 
loss, resulting in an increase of total free energy. The change in shape from spherical to cylindrical 
is an efficient way to minimize total surface area and relax chain stretching. Furthermore, in the 
case of tri-PFPVP, molecular packing into long cylindrical micelles rather than spherical micelles 
of large size would impose severe topological constrictions, as both external blocks of P2VP have 
to be exposed to the solvent. Figure 2-8 sketches the mechanisms by which the cylindrical micellar 
aggregates are thought to be formed. In this scheme, PF rod segments of tri-PFPVP tend to parallel 
packing to protect the insoluble parts by outside coil blocks and gain energy from rod-rod segments 
stacking along the cylinder axis. When MeOH content is increased continuously, individual long 
cylinders are forced to aggregate together to reduce interfacial area in the highly poor solvent 
environment. Together with these topological constraints, the strong π-π stacking of the PF 
segments is also believed to contribute significantly to the stabilization of such aggregated structure.        
The morphology of cylinder, observed by TEM from tri- PFPVP solutions, is also demonstrated by 
TM-SFM topography in parts A and B of Figure 2-9 (MEOH/THF w/w ) 70/30) for height and 
phase images, respectively. The average diameter for cylinders from Figure 2-9(A) or 2-9(B) is 
around 35 nm, which is nearly the same value as that obtained from the TEM results. Moreover, 
Figures 2-9(C) and (D) illustrate height and phase images for “bundles of cylinder” structure 
(MEOH/THF ratio= 90/10), which is in good agreement with TEM micrographs. Since SFM and 
TEM give the structures of the micellar aggregates after evaporation of the solvents, possible 
artifacts from differential evaporation rates of THF and MeOH cannot be ruled out due to the 
different vapor pressures of THF and MeOH. Therefore, cryoTEM from vitrified micellar solutions 
and dynamic light scattering were carried out, to conclusively establish whether the structures 
presented in Figures 2-5-2-9 are the sole result of the selectivity of MeOH for P2VP blocks. 
Figure 2-10 shows the cryoTEM micrographs on vitrified sections from solutions of analogue 
composition. The left column gives the micellar microstructures observed for the di-PFPVP when 
going through MeOH/THF solvent ratios of (A) 0/100, (B) 30/70 and (C) 60/40, while the right 
column gives the micellar microstructures observed for the tri-PFPVP when going through 
MeOH/THF solvent ratios of (D)0/100, (E)30/ 70, and (F) 60/40. Indeed, the presence of aggregates 
already in pure THF are also detectable by cryoTEM, and while in the case of di-PFPVP these 
aggregates are spherical, in the case of tri-PFPVP the aggregates are more elongated in shape. 
Furthermore, also in cryoTEM a great increase in size for the tri-PFPVP micelles is also observed 
with increasingly selective solvent, while the size of di-PFPVP micelles is much more unaffected 
 14
Figure 2-12 shows the UV-vis absorption (left) and photoluminescence spectra (right) of 
tri-PFPVP in different solvent compositions of MeOH/THF. In pure THF, in left side of figure, the 
absorption peak maximum (λmax) is observed at 380 nm and shows blue-shifting to 374 nm upon 
increase in MeOH, evidencing the formation of self-assembled structures with increasing selective 
solvent content. In comparison to di-PFPVP in pure THF, the tri-PFPVP has a higher λmax at the 
same PF block length and similar copolymer compositions (380 nm vs. 374 nm). It implied that 
P2VP coil blocks binding in two sides of the PF rod make the copolymer chains having higher 
symmetric arrangements than the homologue diblock copolymer. Consequently, tri-PFPVP 
polymer chains can stack together favorably and have higher π-π interchain stacking compared with 
the di-PFPVP, leading to the higher absorption maximum.  
The photoluminescence spectrum of tri-PFPVP in pure THF shown in Figure 2-12 has one main 
peak at 415 nm and two shoulders at 439 and 465 nm. As the MeOH content is increased, the 
fluorescence intensity decreases and the quantum yield reduces from 0.65 in pure THF to 0.40 in 
90/10 ratio of MeOH/THF mixture. Moreover, at the MeOH content of 30 wt %, the peak and 
shoulders are red-shifted slightly from 415 to 418, 439 to 443 and 465 to 468 nm, respectively. As 
the MeOH/ THF ratio reaches 50/50 or beyond, the expected red-shifting of three emission peaks is 
observed. The prominent red-shifting on the above peaks and shoulders are observed at 430, 454, 
and 486 nm (dash-dot line) at MeOH/THF ratio of 90/10, respectively. In addition, the emission 
intensity of the shoulder located at the highest wavelength (486 nm) becomes more conspicuous 
than that of the original one, indicating the formation of aggregated excimers. By comparing the 
photoluminescence results of tri-PFPVP with di-PFPVP, only the former one shows the expected 
peak locating at 486 nm for the high MeOH content. This is in agreement with the morphology 
results indicating that tri-PFPVP have higher π-π interchain stacking compared to di-PFPVP, due 
to symmetric architectures. For the case of the di-PFPVP, both UV-vis absorption and 
photoluminescence spectra show blue-shifting with increasing MeOH, which is consistent with an 
H-type aggregation. However, for the tri-PFPVP blue-shifting for UV-vis absorption is observed 
together with red-shifting for photoluminescence upon increasing solvent selectivity. This suggests 
that the effect of polymer architecture on the photophysical properties of conjugated rod-coil 
copolymers is significant. It is well-known that the J-type aggregation shifts the UV-vis and 
emission spectra to red, while the H-type aggregation shifts both the UV-vis and emission spectra to 
blue. These findings suggest, however, that the aggregation occurring in tri-PFPVP is of another 
type, which is not consistent with either H-type or J-type. Similar observation on the photophysical 
properties was also reported in the triblock poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl 
methacrylate)-block-polyfluorene-block-poly(2-(dimethylamino)- ethyl methacrylate) 
(PDMAEMA- b-PF-b-PDMAEMA) system in THF/H2O.
