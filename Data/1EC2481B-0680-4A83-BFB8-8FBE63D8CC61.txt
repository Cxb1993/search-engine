The objective of this study is to investigate the role of conformational change of albumin in 
the boundary lubrication process of artificial joint materials. The key factors affecting the lubrication 
ability of the albumin solutions include: (1) conformational change of the albumin molecules induced 
by thermal or tribological processes; (2) adsorption behaviors of albumin; (3) concentration of the 
albumin solution and (4) mechanical conditions of the tribological process. A schematic of the 
attributions of the key factors on the tribological process of arthroplastic materials is shown in Figure 
1. In this study, the experimental approaches were designed to understand the conformational change 
of albumin induced by the thermal process. The frictional coefficients were measured from linear 
reciprocating friction tests. The purpose was to establish the relationship between the friction 
coefficient and the albumin structure. More importantly, molecular dynamics simulations and  
quantitative adsorption experiments by QCM were carried out to compare the albumin adsorption rate 
and conformational change due to different unfolding process of the protein. Especially, by 
performing the molecular dynamics simulation of the albumin conformational change induced by 
thermal and adsorption processes, we are able to obtain the theoretical predictions of the albumin 
molecular behaviors and provide insight explanations of the boundary lubrication mechanism. 
  
2. Materials and methods  
2.1 Albumin solutions 
Albumin powder (Sigma, AG-1653) was dissolved in the saline solution to prepare the native 
human serum albumin (HSA) solutions with concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, and 12.5 mg/mL. The pH 
valus of the saline solution is 7.45. The pH values of the HSA solutions with concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 
2.5, and 12.5 mg/mL are 7.41, 7.38, 7.36, and 7.24 respectively. The pH values of all the solutions 
used in this study are very close and about the same. The thermal proceesed albumin solutions were 
prepared by pouring 6 mL albumin solution in caped vials and placed in the 55°C, 75°C, and 90°C 
constant temperature water bath for 5 minutes during the heating processes, respectively. The vial was 
then kept at room temperature (25°C) for another 5 minutes. The above procedures were repeated 
until the total period of 30 minutes in the water bath with the specified temperature was reached.  
2.2 Protein analysis 
Fresh, thermal processed, and tribolgoical processed albumin solutions were sampled for 
protein analysis. The conformation of albumin in solution was monitored using a circular dichroism 
spectroscopy (CD, Spectropolarimeter J-810, Jasco). CD is particularly well suited to determine the α-
helical content of proteins in solution. The wavelength at λ1=208nm and λ2=222nm are sensitive 
indicators of α-helical content. As the protein denatures, the ellipticity of the α-helical domains 
decreases toward to zero. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of 
albumin solutions was also performed in polyacrylamide slab gel (4 % stacking / 10 % resolving gel). 
The stacking/ resolving gel buffer compositions and the running electrode buffer containing 0.1% 
SDS were essentially according to Laemmli’s buffer system. The albumin solution was diluted to 
0.063 mg/ml with deionized water and 4X NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Then 10λ of 
0.063 mg/ml albumin (in LDS sample buffer) solution were applied to the gel wells in a vertical mini-
gel apparatus and run at a constant current of 25 mA for 75 minutes. The gel was then stained with 
Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (J.T.BAKER). The BenchMarkTM Protein Ladder (Invitrogen) was 
used as standard marker proteins. 
2.3 Articulating materials 
Highly-crosslinked GUR1050 UHMWPE materials were obtained from United Orthopaedic 
Corporation, Taiwan. UHMWPE cylinder pins were machined to 6.35 mm in diameter and 25.4 mm 
in length with diamond turning on both end surfaces without polishing. The mean roughness (Ra) of 
UHMWPE pins’ end surface is 0.82 m. Co-Cr-Mo alloy plates were prepared as the articulating 
materials and the surfaces were polished (Ra = 0.11 m). The surface roughness of the Co-Cr-Mo 
alloy plates were found higher than that expected for artificial joints (Ra ~ 0.01 m). The roughness of 
the sample was measured by a contact profilometer (Mahr, Germany). 
 4
processes were the two control experiments. It is indicated that no conformational change of albumin 
was observed in the control experiments. The results in Figure 3(a) indicate that the peaks of α-helix 
secondary structure at λ1= 208 nm and λ2= 222 nm were decreased after the thermal processes. With 
increasing thermal processing temperatures, the loss of -helical content increase as well. The results 
show that albumin may lose its secondary structure and lead to the unfolding of this protein after the 
thermal processes. In Figure 3(b), results of SDS-PAGE of albumin did not detect additional protein 
band for control and experimental albumin solutions. It implies that the thermal processes, although 
leading to measurable decrease in the -helical content, did not break albumin molecule into pieces 
to a significant amount in this series of experiments.  
3.2 Friction coefficient   
Figure 4 indicates that the friction coefficient of UHMWPE sliding over CoCrMo in the 
thermal processed albumin solution is higher than the friction coefficients measured in fresh albumin 
solution under various normal stresses and concentrations of albumin solution. The results also 
revealed that the increase of contact stress leads to the decrease of friction coefficient. Thermal 
processed albumin solution contains a measurable amount of unfolded albumin as shown in Figure 3. 
Comparing to PBS solution, both fresh and thermal processed albumin solutions lead to higher 
friction coefficients. It implied the existence of albumin molecules between articulating materials of 
UHMWPE and CoCrMo alloy results in the resistance of the motion. 
  When the steady normal load is about the same, fresh albumin solution, compared with 
thermal processed albumin solution, leads to smaller friction coefficients. It is thought that unfolded 
albumin has a less regular structure than native albumin and may rearrange its irregular conformation 
on the surface more readily, causing a larger amount of protein adsorption on the surface. The 
compacting structure of the unfolded albumin then leads to the increase of friction coefficient. The 
molecular dynamics simulations done in this study successfully assist to obtain the insights of the 
albumin molecular behaviors which can help to provide the possible mechanism of the experimental 
observations.  
3.3 Molecular dynamics simulations of albumin 
Molecular dynamics simulations were also performed to understand the thermal effect on the 
structure change of albumin molecules during the thermal and adsorption onto UHMWPE processes. 
The secondary structure analysis was carried out using the Kabsch and Sander algorithm [37] 
incorporated in their DSSP program. Figure 5 shows the snapshots of structure of albumin at different 
stages (crystal structure) at 300K and 400K. The red areas shown in Figure 5 represent the -helices 
regimes. It is seen that the -helix content decreases with increasing temperatures. Albumin molecules 
further lose most of the -helical content after the stabilization of the adsorption process on 
UHMWPE. 
The root mean square deviation (RMSD) is the measure of the average distance between the 
backbones of superimposed proteins. In the study of globular protein conformations, one customarily 
measures the similarity in 3D structure by the RMSD of the Cα atomic coordinates after optimal rigid 
body superposition. A widely used way to compare the structures of biomolecules or solid bodies is to 
translate and rotate one structure with respect to the other to minimize the RMSD. Table 1 list the 
RMSD values for the thermal unfolding and adsorption processes of albumin indicated in Figure 5. It 
is seen that the thermal process at a higher temperature (400K) lead to a larger variation of albumin 
structure. The adsorption process further induced the structure change which shows a much larger 
RMSD. In contrast, the albumin processed at a lower temperature (300K) results in a smaller RMSD 
value. There is no obvious difference due to the 3 different approach directions.  
3.4 Albumin adsorption rate 
The frequency change curves of the QCM adsorption experiments for fresh albumin solutions 
with different concentrations are shown in Figure 6(a). The frequency measurement was started by 
pumping PBS solution to flow through the path inside the QCM device at a rate of 0.5 μl/s. At point 
A, the albumin solution was introduced at the same flow rate and arrived at the electrode surface.

increase of friction coefficient. The novel molecular dynamics simulations and protein adsorption 
experiments were performed to investigate the mechanisms of the albumin-mediated boundary 
lubrication of arthroplastic materials. The outcomes of this study construct the basis to further 
understand the multi-component boundary lubrication of synovial fluid on artificial joints from both 
experimental evidence and theoretical analysis.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
Friction coefficient experiment: In this study, 
the pin-on-disc tribological testing system was applied 
to measure the friction coefficient of lubricates under 
various concentrations and contact pressures. Figure 2 
shows the friction coefficients of phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS), hyaluronic acid, Human serum albumin, 
and human γ-globulin solutions under 0.25MPa contact 
pressure .The results indicated that friction coefficient 
of hyaluronic acid solutions were smaller than PBS. It 
is implied when hyaluronic acid between the interface 
of UHMWPE and CoCrMo alloy, could promote the 
lubrication then decrease friction. Furthermore, 
compared to PBS solution, both albumin and γ-
globulin solutions lead to higher friction coefficients. 
And, increase of friction coefficients were observed 
while increasing protein concentration. It revealed the 
existence of albumin or γ-globulin molecules between 
articulating materials of UHMWPE and Co-Cr-Mo 
alloy results in the resistance of the motion. As shown 
in Figure 3-5, significant difference of friction 
coefficient was observed between the 0.25MPa and 
5MPa contact pressures. In Figure.3, the friction 
coefficients of HA solutions under 0.25MPa were 
higher than under 5MPa contact pressure. As show in 
Figure.4 and Figure 5, when contact pressure was 
increased, the friction coefficients of albumin and γ-
globulin solutions were obviously decreased. 
A hypothesis model: As discussed above, with 
increasing contact pressure, the friction coefficient of 
HA solution increases. But, the result of albumin and 
γ-globulin will actually opposite with HA solution. 
According to the result, we propose a hypothesis that 
the effects of contact pressure change on the friction 
coefficient as show in Figure 6. In low contact pressure, 
HA solution can form a layer of hydrodynamic film to 
enhance lubrication of interface. But in high contact 
pressure, the HA hydrodynamic film is destroyed then 
which lubrication utility is disappeared leads to the 
friction coefficient of system increases. So, the friction 
coefficient of HA solution increases with increasing 
load. In addition, the albumin and γ-globulin act as 
lubrication inhibitors when it is added to the PBS 
solution. In other word, when albumin or γ-globulin 
exists on the UHMWPE-CoCrMo material interface, 
causes the higher friction coefficient. Therefore, 
increase the contact pressure causes the protein 
molecules to be squeezed from the interface and as a 
result the friction coefficient is reduced.

ABSTRACT 
The lifetime of artificial joints is mainly 
determined by their biotribological properties. 
Synovial fluid which consists of various biological 
molecules acts as the lubricant. Among the 
compositions of synovial fluid, albumin is the most 
abundant protein. Under high load and low sliding 
speed articulation of artificial joint, it is believed the 
lubricants form protective layers on the sliding 
surfaces under the boundary lubrication mechanism. 
The protective molecular layer keeps two surfaces 
from direct collision and thus decreases the possibility 
of wear damage. However, the lubricating ability of 
the molecular layer may vary due to the 
conformational change of albumin in the process. In 
this study, we investigated the influence of albumin 
conformation on the adsorption behaviors on the 
articulating surfaces and discuss the relationship 
between adsorbed albumin and its tribological 
behaviors. We performed the friction tests to study the 
effects of albumin unfolding on the frictional behaviors. 
To further understand and figure out the potential 
mechanisms, protein adsorption experiment and 
molecular dynamics simulation were carried out to 
provide more insights to explain the albumin-mediated 
boundary lubrication of arthroplastic materials. It was 
observed that both the thermal processes induce the 
loss of secondary structure of albumin. The 
compactness of the unfolded structure leads to a higher 
adsorption rate onto the articulating material surface 
and results in the increase of friction coefficient. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Artificial joint system consisting of Co-Cr-Mo 
alloy sliding on ultrahigh molecular weight 
polyethylene (UHMWPE) has been widely used 
clinically. Wear of UHMWPE and wear particles 
induced osteolysis were recognized as the major 
reasons causing the failure of joint arthroplasty. In 
order to improve the lubrication and to reduce the wear 
of the artificial joints in vivo. Further understanding of 
the biological lubrication by the synovial fluid is 
critical and necessary. The dominant lubrication mode 
in the artificial joints is believed to be boundary 
lubrication. Articulating surfaces are protected by the 
adsorbed lubricating molecules of synovial fluid. 
Among the compositions of synovial fluid, albumin is 
the most abundant protein. It is suggested that the 
molecular structure and adsorption behaviors of 
albumin are the dominating factors for the lubrication 
ability. Several studies have attempted to investigate 
the effects of protein properties on the frictional 
characteristics. Our previous studies have shown the 
effect of tribological process induced conformational 
change of human serum albumin on the frictional 
characteristics. However, there still lacks of 
investigations about the conformational change of 
albumin during the adsorption process in boundary 
lubrication and their effects on the tribological 
performance.  
Human serum is a heart-shaped molecule with a 
high α-helical content but no β-sheet. The tertiary 
structure of albumin is composed of three repeating 
domains. People have tried both experimental and 
computational approaches to investigate the albumin 
adsorption on materials. Real-time observation of 
protein- surface interaction, such as surface plasma 
resonance (SPR) or quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) 
was applied to quantify the absorption and desorption 
rates, and the albumin adsorption characteristics had 
been reported. Furthermore, previous molecular 
dynamics simulation dealing with tribological 
behaviors only applied to dry sliding or lubricants of 
small molecular weight. Further investigations are 
needed to calculate the adsorption and structural 
change behaviors of the biomolecules with large 
molecular weight in order to understand the lubrication 
mechanism of albumin in arthroplasty. The objective 
of this study is to investigate the role of conformational 
change of albumin in the boundary lubrication process 
of artificial joint materials by friction tests, quantitative 
adsorption experiments and molecular dynamics 
simulations.  
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
Albumin solutions: Albumin powder (Sigma, 
AG-1653) was dissolved in the saline solution to 
prepare the native human serum albumin (HSA) 
solutions with concentrations of 12.5 mg/mL. The 
thermal processed albumin solutions were prepared by 
pouring 6 mL albumin solution in caped vials and 
placed in the 55°C, 75°C, and 90°C constant 
temperature water bath for 5 minutes during the 
heating processes, respectively. The vial was then kept 
at room temperature (25°C) for another 5 minutes. The 
above procedures were repeated until the total period 
of 30 minutes in the water bath with the specified 
temperature was reached. In order to prepare the
