ABSTRACT 
 
There are many maintenance problems have 
been investigated during the past decades. With 
the growth in complexity of modern systems, 
the cost of purchasing new systems becomes 
higher than before. Especially those high 
technology manufacturing facilities with long 
warranty period, the repair and maintenance 
activities should be investigated before and after 
the warranty period. Surprisingly, little attention 
in the literature has been paid to the failure 
replacement in these preventive maintenance 
models. The overall objective of this research is 
to investigate the optimal maintenance policy 
for the manufacturing system with warranty. 
The optimal maintenance policy is proposed 
with incorporating the costs of minimal repair, 
failure replacement and preventive replacement 
under the average cost criterion.   
 
Keywords： Failure Replacement, Warranty, 
Optimal Maintenance Policy

A Modified Imperfect Preventive Maintenance Policy Considering 
Failure Replacement 
 
Abstract 
This paper is an extension of the periodic imperfect maintenance model in the literature. The 
purpose of this research is to investigate the influence to the optimal periodic maintenance 
policy after considering the failure replacement in the last period of preventive maintenance 
(PM). The specific maintenance actions for a repairable system are when to replace the 
system, to conduct a preventive maintenance or to keep it operating. A partially periodic 
preventive maintenance policy is proposed with incorporating the costs of minimal repair, 
preventive maintenance, failure replacement and preventive replacement. The average cost 
rate for the proposed policy is obtained. Finally, the optimal parameters of the maintenance 
policy can be calculated using the cost rate function and the numerical comparisons of 
different policies are provided to demonstrate the effect of failure replacement. 
Keywords: imperfect maintenance, optimal policy, minimal repair 
1. Introduction 
Almost all systems deteriorate with age and are subject to stochastic failure. Higher operating 
costs and less competitive products are caused by system deterioration, and thus the 
maintenance activity is an essential task for manufacturing systems. When the systems are 
complex and composed of several components, either preventive maintenance or repairs are 
important maintenance activities.  Preventive maintenance (PM) usually can restore the 
manufacturing system to a younger age or state. As a result, the system failures or downtime 
costs can be reduced by the preventive maintenance activity. A minimal repair can return the 
failed system to the working state right before the failure occurred. In contrast to the minimal 
repair, a replacement restores the entire system into the new condition completely so the 
process regenerates at each replacement.  
Many researchers have investigated the preventive maintenance problems in the literature. 
 12
organized as follows. The model and the expected average cost function are given in section2. 
A numerical example where the failure distributions after each PM are modeled by the 
Weibull distributions is provided to evaluate the effect of failure replacement in section 3. 
Finally, conclusions are drawn in the last section. 
 
2. Problem Formulation and Analysis 
In this section, we will define the imperfect maintenance problem and derive the expected 
cost rate per unit time. The imperfect maintenance for the maintenance problem considered in 
this paper is as follows. The system applies PM actions at periodic intervals and results a 
different failure distribution between PM and the failure rate function increases with the 
number of PM. At any instant of time, two maintenance options arise according to the state of 
the system: for a failed system, the decision maker may decide between a minimal repair and 
failure replacement; for a working system, the decision maker may decide between a 
scheduled replacement and preventive maintenance. It is assumed that a failure is instantly 
detected and the time to repair, preventive maintenance or replacement is negligible. The 
following notations and five conditions are assumed throughout this paper. 
2.1 Nomenclature and Assumptions 
Notations:  
1c  cost of a minimal repair at failure 
2c  cost of each scheduled periodic PM 
43 c,c  costs of a scheduled replacement or a failure replacement 
x the time interval between each PM 
t the control limit of the minimal repair in the Nth PM interval, note that t≤ x 
N the number of planned PM cycles for each system  
λk(i) the failure rate function for system’s age i in the kth PM cycle (k=1,2,…,N, i≥ 0) 
Rk(i) the reliability function for system’s age i in the kth PM cycle (k=1,2,…,N, i≥ 0) 
 14
can be easily extended without these restrictions. However, that only adds some extra 
notational complexity without altering any of the failure replacement concepts. The 
assumptions 3 and 4 prevent that early failure replacement in the first (N-1) PM cycle will 
substitute later scheduled PM. Because the general context for this problem is a production 
environment, the repair and replacement costs include lost production as well as labor and 
material costs. The cost term c4 includes both a failure cost as well as a repair cost, thus 
assumption 5 should be satisfied.  
2.2 The Modified PM Model with Failure Replacement 
 
The minimization criterion is based on the expected average cost. Let C1(x, N) denote the 
expected cost rate for a system which is maintained preventively at periodic interval x for N-1 
times and is replaced at the end of the Nth interval as obtained in [5]. In this model, the 
expected cost function as shown in Eq. (1) only consists of minimal repair cost, the preventive 
maintenance cost for N-1 times and the scheduled replacement cost.

Under the maintenance scheme with failure replacement option, the cost functions can be 
established for two cases : 43 cc =  and 43 cc < . 
Case 1 43 cc = : Let C2(t, x, N) denote the expected average cost rate for a system which 
is also maintained preventively at periodic interval x for N-1 times except the control limit of 
minimal repair at time t in the Nth PM interval. The system is replaced with replacement cost 
c3 either at the first failure after the control limit of minimal repair in the Nth PM interval 
(failure replacement) or at the end of the Nth interval (scheduled replacement). Then the 
expected cost rate is given by

It has been proved in [5] that there exists a finite and unique N such that

as well as a lower bound for any given t and x, it has a optimal N2*which would minimize C2(t, 
x, N).  It also implies that N2* would be either be the N1* or N1*+1 which N1* minimizes C1(x, 
N) as calculated in [5].  
As soon as we confirmed that the optimal number of PM exists, it can be determined by 
the recursive search method. Thus the optimal PM interval x and control limit t can be 
obtained by minimizing Eq. (2). However, the partial derivatives of Eq. (3) are too complicate 
to yield any analytical expression. The evaluation of Hessian matrix is timing-consuming. 
Therefore, a searching algorithm using nonlinear optimization method for the optimal 
parameters of PM policy is proposed later after the second case is discussed.

the maintenance problem. Then the average cost rate function is

The last component of the numerator represents the expected cost for both the failure 
replacement (if any failure occurs after the control limit) and the schedule replacement. The 
denominator of the cost function same as in Eq. (2) corresponds with the mean renewal cycle 
 18
rate using failure replacement results in smaller cost rate than the cases without using failure 
replacement in [5]. It is also noted that higher failure replacement cost (c4 = c3 + 0.5 c1) may 
increase the number of PM or increase the length of PM interval, but their cost rates (C3 (t*, 
x2*, N2*) / c1) are still smaller than the cost rates (C1 (x1*, N1*) / c1) in [5]. This result 
indicates that failure replacement considered as the action of the failed system can effectively 
decrease the average cost in the optimal maintenance policy.

4. Conclusion 
This paper extended the maintenance policy which was proposed by Nakagawa [5]. The 
optimal maintenance problem under the average cost criterion is formulated and numerically 
showed that the modified optimal maintenance policy has smaller expected cost rate. In this 
paper, the costs incurred for a minimal repair, preventive maintenance and replacement are 
assumed independent of the system’s age. The problems with age dependent cost structures 
seem to be practically more important. The examination of the optimality for maintenance

he considered another PM model that a system undergoes PM to have a different failure distribution between PM and 
the failure arte increases with the frequency of PM.  Most of the models in the literatures, e.g. Lie and Chun [6], 
Jayabalan and Chaudhuri [7], are to determine the optimal interval between PMs and the number of PMs before 
replacing the system by minimizing the expected average cost. However, these models mentioned above did not 
consider the reliability limit and in practice, high reliability is usually required to avoid high probability of system 
unexpected failures occurred. Cheng and Chen [8] have demonstrated that the optimal periodic PM policy proposed 
Park et al. [3] will result in low reliability at the time before preventive maintenance. 
 This research is an extension of the model developed by Nakagawa [5] in which an optimal periodic PM policy is 
investigated for a repairable system with different failure rate functions after each PM. Hence, this paper is to develop 
a efficient search algorithm to obtain the optimal PM policy over an infinite time span by minimizing the expected cost 
rate with consideration of reliability limit and the option of using a failure replacement. With these modifications, the 
proposed model is more close to real world situations.

2.1. NOMENCLATURE AND  ASSUMPTIONS 
mc  cost of minimal repair at failure 
fs cc ,  costs of scheduled replacement and failure replacement 
cpm cost of each scheduled periodic PM 
Rmin acceptable reliability limit at the time of preventive maintenance 
x the time interval between each PM 
t the control limit of the minimal repair in the Nth PM interval 
N the number of PM cycles for a system which is either replaced at the end of the N
th cycle or the first 
failure at the Nth cycle after the control limit t 
λk(i) the failure rate function for system’s age i in the kth PM cycle (k=1,2,…,N, i≥ 0) 
Rk(i) the reliability function for system’s age i in the kth PM cycle (k=1,2,…,N, i≥ 0) 
The following assumptions are made throughout this paper. 
1. Single system is investigated and the system is deteriorating over time with increasing failure rate (IFR). 
2. PM is applied at a fixed interval time x. After each PM, the age of the system is restored to zero following 
with the failure rate increasing with the number of PM.  That is, the system has failure rate λk(i) in the kth PM 
cycle and λk(i)< λk+1(i) for any i≥ 0.  
3. The control limit (i.e., t) is arranged  in the Nth PM interval in which minimal repair is used for any failure 
occurring before time t. The system undergoes minimal repair for any failure occurred in the first (N-1) PM 
cycle and the time before time t in the Nth cycle. 
4. Failure replacement can only be applied after time t in the Nth PM interval. It prevents that early failure 
replacement in the first (N-1) PM cycle will substitute later scheduled PM. The system is replaced at the first 
failure after the control limit of minimal repair in the Nth PM interval (failure replacement) or at the end of 
the Nth interval (scheduled replacement) when the systems reliability declined to a specified level Rmin. 
5. The cost items are known with the following relationship: ,fsm ccc ≤≤  ,fspm ccc ≤≤ msf ccc ≤− . 
In this section, we will define the repair/replacement problem and establish the expected average cost function. It 
is assumed that a failure is instantly detected and the time to repair, preventive maintenance or replacement is 
negligible. The second assumption is adopted from Nakagawa [5]. Assumption 3 and 4 are employed to simplify 
mathematical formulation of the expected cost function and it can be easily extended to more general cases. However, 
that only adds some extra notational complexity without altering any of the failure replacement concepts.  Because the 
general context for this problem is a production environment, the repair and replacement costs include lost production 
as well as labor and material costs. The cost term cm includes both a failure cost (equal to cf -cs) as well as a repair cost , 
thus assumption 5 should be satisfied.

policy has smaller expected cost rate. In this paper, the costs incurred for a minimal repair, preventive maintenance  
and replacement are assumed independent of the system’s age. The problems with age dependent cost structures seem 
to be practically more important. The examination of the optimality of repair/replacement policy under such cost 
structure is left for future research.

ABSTRACT 
This paper investigates the effects of a pro rata rebate warranty (PRRW) on the age-replacement policy with 
salvage value consideration for a non-repairable product. Cost models from the customer's perspective are 
developed for both warranted and non-warranted products, and the corresponding optimal replacement ages are 
derived such that the long-run expected cost rate is minimized. Under the increasing failure rate assumption, the 
existence and uniqueness of the optimal age for preventive replacement are shown, and the impacts of a product 
warranty on the optimal age-replacement policy are investigated analytically. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
It can be note that the rebate warranty policy is rarely considered in such related topics research, although it is also 
one of the most common types of warranty policies. Chien and Chen [1] recently discussed the optimal spare ordering 
policy for a non-repairable product under the rebate warranty. Moreover, all these papers mentioned above assumed 
that whenever a product is replaced, it is discarded, no matter the replacement is preventive or corrective. However, 
for a product is preventive replaced, it maybe still operable. Thus, it is reasonable to consider the value of residual life 
(i.e., salvage value) of an un-failed product into the preventive replacement model, especially, when the product is 
under warranty. Therefore, this paper focuses on analyzing the impact of a pro rata rebate warranty (PRRW) policy on 
the optimal age-replacement policy with salvage value consideration. Taking PRRW into account, a mathematical 
formulation for a non-repairable product under the classical age-replacement policy is developed. For product with an 
IFR function, it can be shown that there exists a unique optimal replacement age such that the long-run expected cost 
rate is minimized. Moreover, the optimal replacement ages as well as the corresponding cost rates for products with 
and without PRRW are compared analytically, its structural properties are summarized, and a numerical example is 
demonstrated for illustration and verification. 
2. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 
Under the classical age-replacement policy solely, a non-repairable product is replaced at a certain age t, or upon 
failure, whichever occurs first. More precisely, when the product fails at age x ≤ t, a failure replacement (corrective 
replacement) is performed with a downtime cost Cd > 0$ and a purchasing cost Cp > 0. If the age of the product reaches

Case 2. t < w: First, if a failure occurs before a preventive replacement (i.e., x < t < w), then a downtime cost Cd and 
a purchasing cost Cp are incurred, and a refund amount R(x) is also gained. Second, when the product reaches age t (x ≥ t), a preventive replacement is performed with cost Cp, and the salvage value vs ⋅ (x − t) is also gained. 
According to the above descriptions, the elapsed time and the total cost in a renewal cycle (denoted by T2(t) and
