I. Introduction 
The 850nm oxide-confined VCSELs are a key component in the short-distance (enterprise, i.e., 
<100 m) fiber communication. The demand for ever increasing data rates imposes stringent 
requirements on these VCSELs, which have multi-transverse modes. A modal-dependent time 
transient waveform can severely limit the data rate. We thus endeavor to study the AC dynamic 
waveforms of individual modes. 
This study consists of two parts: the identification of modes from the spectrum, and the transient 
waveforms of individual modes. In the process of mode identification, we found that the mode spacing 
can be used to estimate the oxide aperture. This can be a useful method for the measurement of the 
oxide aperture, which is an important screening parameter for quality control.  
Modal dynamics has been studied both experimentally and theoretically [1-3]. The experiment was 
performed on an implant VCSEL with a complicated setup. We used a simple setup to measure the 
waveform of individual modes of oxide VCSELs. Different modes were found to have different 
turn-on time. This information is useful in the design of high-speed VCSELs. 
 
II. Calculation of modal wavelengths and the oxide aperture determination 
A. Modal wavelength calculation 
We now calculate the wavelengths of the lasing modes for a circular-aperture oxide VCSEL with 
oxide diameter d. The light is generated in the active region and propagates in the vertical direction. 
Because the oxide layer is not distributed evenly in the vertical direction, the structure does not 
resemble a traditional waveguide. However, due to the short cavity length, the effect of the oxide can 
be considered evenly distributed with an average effective index [4]. The VCSEL thus can be 
considered a traditonal dielectric waveguide.  A rigorous solution for the guided modes requires 
solving Maxwell’s equations. Fortunately, because the index guiding is weak for oxide VCSELs (i.e., 
the index variation is a small fraction of the average index), the Maxwell’s equations can be 
approximated with a much simpler scalar wave equation [5]. The modes calculated under this 
approximation are called LP (linearly polarized) modes. The fields E and the associated propagation 
constants  for each mode are the eigen functions and eigen values of the differential equation (in 
cylindrical coordinates)

C. Relation between the mode spacing and the aperture 
For a a step-index waveguide, if n1-n2 is large enough (providing that the weak guide 
approximation is still valid), the lower-order LP modes will be tightly confined, i.e., their fields at the 
core-clad boundary, r = d/2, are close to zero. If we make the tight-confinement approximation that the 
field is zero at the core-clad interface, ( ) 0lJ u  , then

where Z is a zero of the Bessel function, which is 2.405 for LP01 mode and 5.520 for LP02 mode.  
Substituting the effective index obtained from Eq.(5) into Eq.(3), the modal wavelength can be 
obtained. The wavelength difference between 2 guided modes  can be expressed in terms of the 
difference between the zeroes of the Bessel function

longitudinal-mode spacing in an edge emitter is inversely proportional to the cavity length [6], the 
transverse mode spacing of the VCSEL is inversely proportional to the square of the aperture, i.e., the 
area. 
We numerically calculate the modal wavelengths by solving Eq.(4) for an oxide VCSEL with 
n1=3.30, n2=3.27, and ng=3.80.The wavelength difference between LP01 and LP02 mode is plotted

Obviously there is a big uncertainty as to where exactly the highest order guided mode in the 
spectrum is. Fortunately, simulation showed that the numerical curve in Fig. 2 is not very sensitive to 
n1-n2 (because LP01 and LP02 modes are typically well confined). Oxide VCSELs with various 
apertures were studied. The apertures were measured with the traditional near-field method. A typical 
near-field image is shown in Fig. 4. The wavelength difference between LP01 and LP02 is read from 
the measured spectrum. (The LP21 and LP02 modes are nearly degenerate and not resolved in this 
spectrum.)  versus aperture for the experimental data is plotted in Fig.5 along with the numerical 
curve. The numerical curve agrees well with the experimental data points. The slight discrepancy may 
be due to the errors in the measurement of the aperture and the wavelength, and the small contribution 
of the thermal lens. This strong correlation between the mode spacing and the aperture allows us to 
estimate the aperture by measuring the mode spacing. 
Since the relationship between  and the aperture is expect to hold for any 2 modes, why did we 
pick LP01 and LP02 modes? The answer is that these are the 2 lowest order circular symmetric modes. 
The low order modes are desirable because they are easier to identify in the spectrum. Circular 
symmetry gives them some insensitivity to the nocircularity of the aperture. A perturbational analysis 
shows that the effective index of the circular-symmetric modes is determined, to the first order, by the 
aperture area [7].

III. Spectrally resolved transient waveforms 
A. Experimental setup 
The experimental setup to measure the AC waveforms for each lasing mode is shown in Fig.6. It is 
similar to the standard AC measurement system except for the additional monochromator (Spectral 
Products Digikröm DK242) which serves as a wavelength filter (or, equivalently, mode filter in the 
case of VCSELs). Most commercial monochromators have either one or two gratings. The latter have 
a higher spectral resolution and a larger insertion loss. A grating produces a pulse broadening because 
the light rays reflected from the adjacent grooves differ by a wavelength in optical path. DK242 uses a 
grating with a 68 mm width and 1200 grooves/mm. This translates into a 231-ps broadening. To 
mitigate this broadening, a 2nd grating in DK242 is positioned at the mirror image of the first one 
(Fig.7). This “subtractive dispersion mode” reverses the temporal broadening. With this configuration, 
the spectral filtering occurs at mid slit between two grating chambers.

The waveform and the spectrum for the emission through the monochromator with a 3000m 
(wide open) mid-slit width are shown in Fig.9(c) and (d) respectively. The insertion loss of the 
monochromator is 25 dB, which is much larger than the ideal value of 8 dB estimated from the 
combined loss due to mirrors and gratings. (Spectral Products is a small company. It probably does not 
have the resource to optimize the design for low loss. The optimal alignment for low loss is at the end 
of the travel of both the input and the output micrometer. This made it very difficult to reproducibly 
obtain enough signals for experiment. The results shown here are thus from a single measurement on a 
good day.) Due to the signal reduction, the waveform is noisy and averaging was employed to increase 
the signal to noise ratio. Comparison of the spectra with and without monochromator seems to indicate 
that all modes suffer equal amount of loss in the monochromator. However the waveforms are quite 
different. The one with monochormator filtering has a more pronounced relaxation oscillation, 
implying that some modes are filtered out. Since the monochromator may be polarizing, the blocked 
modes are probably those of one particular polarization. (The relative shift in time axis in these two 
waveforms is due to the different optical paths and is not indicative of different turn-on times.)

Modal transient was studied before [2] using a more complicated setup on an implant VCSEL. Our 
method is simpler but limited by the high insertion loss in the monochromator. Due to the scantiness of 
the data, the above conclusions should be confirmed with more measurements. With the expertise 
available in the Avago Optics group, a high-efficiency, versatile monochromator should be readily 
doable. If the monochromator insertion loss can be reduced to less than10 dB, there may be a chance 
to study the intensity noise for each mode.
