datasets were transferred to a PC-based workstation (Xeleris; GE) by DICOM transfer. 
FDG uptake was assessed visually by attenuation-corrected and as well as a rotating 
maximum intensity projection images. Standardized uptake value (SUV) normalized for 
lean body mass was calculated from the 45-min and 150-min images. A region of interest 
(ROI) of 3×3 pixels was manually placed on the vascular wall in the transaxial image 
surrounding the most intense area of FDG uptake.  
BIOMARKERS MEASUREMENTS 
Blood sampling was done with ≥12h fasting. Serum high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) 
was measured by a chemiluminescent enzyme-labeled immunometric assay (Immulite 
C-Reactive Protein, Diagnostic Products Co.; LA, USA). The lowest detectable level of 
the hs-CRP assay was 0.01 mg/dL. MMP-1 was determined with a commercially available 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using Biotrak assay System (Amersham; 
UK).  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Data were shown as means ± SD. Comparisons between groups were made using 
Student's t test and chi-square analysis or Mann–Whitney U-test for continuous and 
categorical variables, respectively. The strength of associations was estimated by Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient (R). A P value <0.05 was predetermined to be statistically significant 
(Stata, Texas, USA). 
 
RESULTS 
CLINICAL INFORMATION  
The study population comprised 25 carotid stenotic subjects and 22 controls. The 
demographic characteristics of patients and controls are listed in Table 1. Nineteen patients 
(76%) underwent stenting. No peri-procedural event occurred. The average follow-up after 
the index procedures was 16 ± 3 (from 12 to 24) months. No symptomatic or angiographic 
recurrence occurred. 
PET/CT IMAGING ANALYSES  
Among the 25 subjects with carotid stenosis, the pattern of FDG uptake in aorta was 
linear in 20 (80%), bandlike in 1, focal in 4 (3 in aortic arch and 1 in ascending aorta) on 
coronal views. In the neck regions, FDG uptake was linear in 15 (60%), bandlike in 1, and 
focal in the other 9. None of the controls exhibited obvious FDG uptake in whole body 
scans by visual assessment. Higher SUV along the arterial walls on whole body scans were 
observed in the patients with carotid stenosis (mean 2.1 ± 0.5; range 1.5-4.4), while none 
of the controls had SUV higher than 2.0 (mean 1.5 ± 0.3; range 0.7-2.0) in any major 
vascular beds (P < 0.005). Of note, positive FDG uptake or the highest SUV were not 
consistently located at the sites of calcification. Representative images are shown in Fig. 1. 
BIOMARKERS 
The leukocyte counts and MMP-1 were significantly higher in subjects with carotid 
 2
 Our study showed that FDG PET/CT can depict metabolic active atherosclerotic 
plaques, and patients with higher FDG uptake also had higher circulating MMP-1. Thus, 
FDG PET/CT could be used as a non-invasive imaging modality in detecting and 
monitoring atherosclerotic process.

First-pass contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion imaging at 3 Tesla MR System  
 
PURPOSE: To test the feasibility of first-pass contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion 
imaging at 3 Tesla MR system, we obtained perfusion index from healthy subjects and 
patients with coronary artery stenosis, and to evaluate the change in perfusion index 
between normal, remote and ischemic myocardium.   
MATERIALS AND METHODS: First-pass contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging was 
performed on 12 patients and 32 age-matched healthy subjects in both rest and 
dipyridamole-induced stress states. After bolus injection of contrast agent, Gd-DTPA with 
dose of 0.025 mmole/kg and injection time of 1.5 sec, three short-axis images from apex to 
base of the left ventricle (LV) were acquired for 80 cardiac cycles using saturation 
recovery turbo FLASH sequence (Fig. 1). The maximal upslope (Upslope) was derived 
from the signal-time curves of the LV cavity and myocardium to measure myocardial 
perfusion. Within 72 hours after MR examination, patients received coronary angiography, 
and the results were correlated with MR results.  
RESUTS: Using our protocol of contrast agent administration, sufficient perfusion 
contrast was obtained without susceptibility-induced signal drop-out at the interface 
between LV cavity and the myocardium. In healthy volunteers, Upslope showed no 
dependence on myocardial segments or coronary territories (Fig. 2). Upslope increased 
significantly from rest to stress in normal myocardium ((0.09±0.03 vs. 0.16±0.05, p < 
0.001) and remote myocardium, (0.09±0.03 vs. 0.13±0.03, p < 0.001), whereas in ischemic 
myocardium the change was insignificant (0.11±0.03 vs. 0.10±0.04, p = ns). This resulted 
in significant difference in the ratio of Upslope at stress to that at rest, representing 
myocardial perfusion reserve, between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium 
(0.96±0.41 vs. 1.71±0.42, p < 0.001 for ischemic vs. normal myocardium; 0.96±0.41 vs. 
1.59±0.40, p < 0.001 for ischemic vs. remote myocardium) (Fig. 3 & 4).  
CONCLUSIONS: First-pass contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion imaging at 3 Tesla is 
feasible. The Upslope ratio can differentiate ischemic from non-ischemic myocardium.

 Figure 2: Graphics illustrate the Mean±95% confidence interval (N = 30) of normative 
Upslope (top left) and Upslope ratios (top right) in different coronary territories. The 
Upslope ratio shows no significant difference among three coronary territories or among 
different segments in each level (bottom).  
 
 
Figure 3: Vasodilatation response of the maximal upslope (Upslope) in the ischemic, 
remote and normal myocardial segments (left panel). Blunt response of these indices can 
be seen in the ischemic segments. The ratio indices in the ischemic segments are 
significantly different from those in the non-ischemic segments (right panel).

計畫成果自評 
 
In the second year of the project, from 2006 August 1 to 2007 July 31, we have 
achieved two goals that are relevant to the ultimate aim of our project. First, we have 
characterized the plaques of carotid atherosclerosis and have found the relationships 
between FDG uptake and matrix metalloproteinase-1. Second, we have established clinical 
protocol for myocardial perfusion at 3T MRI and have validated its diagnostic accuracy in 
coronary artery stenosis. The first work was published in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 
and the second work was published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance. 
These two works allow us to monitor the patients with carotid or coronary arteries stenosis 
who underwent stent therapy, and further understand the pathophysiology of the in-stent 
stenosis and, perhaps, design appropriate preventive measures.
