transmitted antennas and Nr received antennas. The baseband 
equivalent model can be described in Eq. (1). 
          Y=HS+n                           (1)    
At each symbol time, a vector S =[s1,s2,..,sNt ]T with each 
symbol belonging to the q quadrature amplitude modulation 
(q-QAM) constellation passes through the channel response 
NrNt matrix H. The received vector Y= [y1,y2,..,yNr ]T at the 
receiving antenna for each symbol time is a noisy 
superimposition of the Nt signals contaminated by additive 
white Gaussian noise (AWGN). 
The complex matrix Eq. (1) can be transformed to its real 
matrix representation as Eq. (2).

B. K-Best Sphere Decoding Algorithm 
The ML detector is the optimum detection algorithm for 
the MIMO system. It requires finding the signal point S from 
all transmit vector signal set that minimizes the Euclidean 
distance with respect to the received signal vector y with 
QR-decompositions as given in Eq. (3) ： 
ˆ ˆarg arg2 2s min -HS min -RS Y y                   (3) 
Expanding the vector norm in Eq. (3) yields into Eq. (4) ：

The detection process starts from the last layers l=Nt and 
works the way until the first layer is detected. It is to perform 
an exhaustive search of all possible combinations of the 
transmitted symbols that minimizes 2Y-HS .  
The branch cost function associated with nodes in the i-th layer 
is：

Each node in the tree corresponds to a so-called partial 
Euclidean distance （PED）Ti(s (i )) ,where TN t+1(s(N t+1)) = 0 and 
term | e i(s(i) )| 2 denotes the distance increment between two 
successive nodes in the tree. 
At each layer, K-best detector approximates a breadth-first 
search by keeping only K candidates with the smallest PEDs 
are kept for the next level search. Therefore, at least K values 
need to be implemented with circuits. To meet the requirement 
of K-best detector system, a more popular sorting architecture, 
including bubble sorting, bitonic merge sorting and odd-even 
sorting, has been proposed, the modified merge sorting which 
can achieve fast sorting. 
 
III. SORTING ARCHITECTURES 
A. Bubble Sorting 
Bubble sorting is the most common sorting technique, as 
shown in Figure 1. If there are n data (I1,I2,…In) waiting for 
sorting, on the 1st, 2nd, …nth position, the first and the second 
data (I1,I2) will compare themselves with each other. The 
smaller results will be pushed down and the larger results will 
be pulled up. Similarly, comparing the second and the third 
data, pushing the smaller results down and pulling the larger 
ones up and so on. The minimum value can then be obtained 
from the first loop and the second minimum value from the 
second loop. Only eight minimum values are required in this 
work. After obtaining the eight minimum values from eight 
loops, sorting will be finished. 
Therefore, when there are n data waiting for sorting, (n-1) 
loops will be needed. The first loop will give out the first 
maximum value by comparing (n-1) times while the second 
loop will give out the second maximum value by comparing 
(n-2) times. The time complexity will be O(n2). Figure 1 
deduces that we need n(n-1)/2 comparisons.

B. Parallel Bubble Sorting 
We can notice from the previous section that the sorting time 
and the waiting time of bubble sorting are in proportional 
relationships. In order to save time, comparison of I3 and I4 of 
the first loop and comparison of I1and I2 of the second loop will 
be carried out simultaneously. Therefore, at the same unit time, 
there will be different data processing, as shown in Figure 2. 
This method is called parallel bubble sorting whose time 
complexity is O(2n-3), requiring n(n-1)/2 comparisons.

IV. SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION 
RESULTS 
Most of the sorting circuits are basically composed of 
comparators. Figure 6(b) shows the defined comparator 
module, simplified in Figure 6(a). After comparing by the 
comparator, the Buffers will keep the data and the operating 
frequency can speed up, like the pipeline structure. Figure 7 is 
the proposed modified merge sorting structure. Like the 
pipeline structure, the 8 comparators can compare at the same 
time, therefore, fast sorting. 
Figure 8 shows the simulation of the proposed modified merge 
sorting. Input 16 random values and then output 8 minimum 
values. Comparing all the sorting hardware data, as in Table 3, 
all kinds of sorting will have 64 inputs, containing 8-bit for 
each. By using the synthesis tool to analyze hardware structure, 
we can finally find out that the proposed modified merge 
sorting has high throughput and the best hardware efficiency. 
This paper has used ISE Xilinx device xc4vlx60-12ff1148 for 
FPGA hardware simulation and layout. The utility rate is 
shown as Table IV which also shows that the proposed utility 
rate suit the system best.

V. CONCLUSION 
This paper has made analysis and structure design on the 
sorting network of MIMO K-best detector in wireless 
communication. It has proposed a sorting called modified 
merge sorting which has taken the advantages of the superior 
structure of bitonic merge sorting and the small hardware of 
odd-even merge sorting. The hardware of the proposed one is 
even smaller than the odd-even one. For the sake of MIMO 
detector, this paper has implemented a 64-input modified 
merge sorting structure. When the operating frequency is at 
85MHz, throughput can reach 680Mbps.
