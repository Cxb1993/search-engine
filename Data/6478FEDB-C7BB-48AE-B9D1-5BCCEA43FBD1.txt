Abstract 
Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp), a new 
concept proposed by Mark Weiser, is seen as 
a fundamental development direction for the 
21st century’s computing technology. Ubi- 
comp is about networked microprocessors 
embedded in everyday objects, all talking to 
each other over wireless links. 
While recent research in ubiquitous 
computing has focused on network protocols, 
energy efficiency, and distributed databases, 
there is much less attention given to security. 
However, in many applications the security 
aspects are as important as performance and 
low energy consumption.  
Security in ubicomp is a challenging 
problem because asymmetric key 
cryptosystems are unsuitable for resource 
constrained sensor nodes. In particular, 
proper authentication and access control 
techniques, as well as privacy preserving 
solutions, suited to ubiquitous computing 
environment, are badly needed. This project 
is aimed at finding the most adequate 
solutions to these security problems. 
Our research goals are three-fold: (1) rethink 
the basic assumptions of security—what are 
the resources that need protection and what 
are the threats in ubiquitous computing, (2) 
design a method that would enable different 
security levels by using different 
authentication techniques that are suited to 
the context, and (3) propose schemes to 
support for spontaneous interoperation, in 
which two or more devices interact 
temporarily in ad hoc circumstances. 
Our major contributions are the followings: 
1. There are many important problems in 
ubiquitous computing environment. One of 
them is how to associate between wireless 
devices spontaneously to achieve secure 
communication. These associations can be 
roughly divided into two types: short-term 
associations and long term associations. The 
TAP (touch-mediated association protocol) 
belongs to the latter. We focus on the TAP 
scheme and one of its devices, Mediator. One 
problem with the Mediator is that it can not 
authenticate the devices which request to 
associate with Mediator. This will effectuate 
the secure information compromised. We 
propose a scheme which takes advantage of 
the time of flight and the secret sharing to 
solve this problem. 
2. In ubiquitous computing environments 
many services are based on the locations of 
users. Therefore, location authentication in 
ubiquitous computing is very important. 
However, it is harder and harder to 
authenticate users’ locations because users 
are movable. We propose a new framework 
using Mobile RFID to build the whole 
environment and make use of the concept of 
absolute distance to achieve the goal of 
location authentication. In addition, our 
method ensures that users are still in the 
distance for servers to authenticate when 
waiting for authentication. Moreover, 
building the whole environment consumes 
fewer resources, and is less influenced by 
environment limitations and hence more 
practical.

Ubiquitous computing encompasses a wide 
range of research topics, including 
distributed computing, mobile computing, 
sensor networks, human-computer 
interaction, and artificial intelligence. 
Obviously, much more work has to be done 
to realize ubiquitous computing.

In this paper, the authors describe a 
framework for authentication and 
authorization in collaborative environments 
which supports incremental trust. A first 
prototype of this model is being 
implemented in a secure messaging system 
that is part of the Pervasive Collaborative 
Computing Environment (PCCE) project at 
LBNL. The implementation incorporates 
PKI, username/password, and guest 
authentication methods. It provides an 
authorization process that is aware of an 
individual's trust level.

  This paper presents a paradigm shift from 
 4
place. Such monitoring also allows to take 
corrective action when interactions are 
proceeding unsatisfactorily. In this vein, 
the authors first present a trust-based 
model of interaction based on event 
structures. then describe the ongoing work 
in the development of a monitor 
architecture which enables self-protective 
actions to be carried out at critical points 
during principal interaction.

The author regards the novel ubicom as 
Ubiquitous computing seeks to embed 
computers into our everyday lives in such 
ways as to render them invisible and allow 
them to be taken for granted, and social and 
cultural theories of everyday life have 
always been interested in rendering the 
invisible visible and exposing the mundane. 
In this paper, the author despites these 
related concerns, social and cultural studies 
remain in the background of discussions of 
ubiquitous technology design. This essay 
seeks to introduce researchers in both fields 
to each other, and begin to explore the ways 
in which collaboration might proceed. This 
paper investigates notions of sociality, 
spatialization and temporalization as central 
to our experiences of everyday life, and 
therefore of interest to the design of 
ubiquitous computing.

In this paper, the authors discuss the 
privacy is a severe problem facing pervasive 
computing. The fundamental question arises: 
Who gets to know personal data stored on 
mobile devices? Current devices have access 
controls for the user of the device, but do not 
consider the environment from a privacy 
aspect. The user has limited control over 
which personal data is offered at different 
locations. However, this information offered 
already allows the generation of various 
profiles of the device's user, for example 
location profiles. To improve the user's 
privacy, this paper propose a situation-based 
control over the data published and the 
services offered. Comparable to "normal 
life", this identity management allows the 
device to present different subsets of the 
user's identity depending on the perceived 
context.
