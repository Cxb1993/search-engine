of the coating [21-26] etc. Previous studies also 
showed that Pt-containing alloys [21] and Pt 
aluminized coatings exhibited better oxidation 
[22-25] and corrosion resistance [26] than 
single aluminized coatings. Most Pt aluminized 
coating studies relate to bulk superalloys 
[21-28] and are rarely adapted to sprayed 
coatings [29, 30]. Recently, high velocity 
oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying processes have 
attracted interest for preparing MCrAlY 
coatings. Therefore, microstructures and 
oxidation behavior of aluminized, 
Pt-aluminized HVOF sprayed CoNiCrAlY 
coatings were investigated in this study. 
 
2. Experimental Procedure  
 
Hastelloy-X superalloy coupons with 
dimensions of 100mm×25mm×2mm were 
chosen as substrates. The substrates were 
abraded with # 800 SiC paper to remove the 
outer layer, then washed in distilled water and 
ultrasonically degreased in acetone. After that, 
both sides of the samples were grit-blasted with 
alumina powder to increase adherence between 
the CoNiCrAlY coating and the substrate. The 
samples were then sprayed with a 
Co-32.6Ni-21.1Cr-8.3Al-0.6Y (in wt. %) bond 
coat using a high pressure high velocity oxygen 
fuel (HVOF) spray system (Praxair Tafa 
JP8000) with a spraying distance of 30 cm and 
kerosene ( C7H16) were utilized as spray fuel. 
Oxygen flow rate, fuel flow rate and powder 
feed rate were respectively 56.7 SCMH, 4.8 
GPH and 82 g/min. The coating thickness was 
about 250 μm. A platinum thin film around 7.5 
μm in thickness was further deposited on the 
surface of CoNiCrAlY coating by a magnetron 
sputtering process. The superalloy coupons 
with bare bond coat and Pt deposited bond coat 
were pack aluminized at 850oC for 4 hours to 
produce (Ni, Co)Al and PtAl2 phases on the 
surface, respectively. Two coatings were 
identified as “aluminized” and “Pt-aluminized” 
coatings in this work. Details of the pack 
aluminizing process were revealed in the 
previous study [2] except the Al-30 wt. % Co 
aluminizing powder was adopted in present 
work. Then, all specimens were subjected to a 
thermal cyclic test at 1100oC. Each testing 
cycle included 60 min at 1100oC, followed by 
ambient air cooling for 10 min. Weight changes 
were recorded every 2 cycles (except the first 
cycle) with a precision electronic balance with 
0.1 mg accuracy. 
The microstructures of both as-processed 
and oxidation tested coatings were observed by 
using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
X-ray diffractometry (XRD) equipped with a 
Cu target was used to analyze the phases of 
coatings. An electron probe microanalyzer 
(EPMA) was utilized to analyze the element 
distribution. 
 
3. Results and Discussion  
 
3.1 Microstructure evaluation  
 
Typical SEM surface morphology of the 
Pt aluminized coating is shown in Fig. 1. 
Protrusion characteristics can be observed in 
all samples. All specimen surfaces were not 
flattened by either an aluminizing or a Pt 
aluminizing process and exhibit a surface 
roughness (Ra) about 8.5 μm.  Cross-sectional 
EPMA microstructures of HVOF sprayed 
Co-32.6Ni-21.1Cr-8.3Al-0.6Y coatings 
revealed that the coating consisted of a 
γ-CoNiCrAl phase with γ’-Ni3Al phase 
embedded in the matrix. Similar observation 
was illustrated in previous study [8]. The 
γ’-Ni3Al phase reveals brighter image in Al 
mapping photography, which will be identified 
by XRD in the next section. The EPMA 
cross-sectional microstructures of an 
aluminized sample revealed that the outer 
region of the aluminized coating consisted of a 
β-(Co, Ni)Al phase with a thickness about 
40μm. Microstructures of the aluminized 
sample were similar to the region below PtAl2 
phase in Fig. 2, but Al2O3 inclusion during 
pack aluminizing is present in the β-(Co, Ni)Al 
layer for aluminized sample. Fig. 2 indicates 
that the outer part of the Pt-aluminized coating 
consists of a 15 μm thick PtAl2 phase and a 
β-(Co, Ni)Al phase beneath it. For aluminized 
and Pt-aluminized samples, an interdiffusion 
zone possessing a higher Cr concentration was 
observed between β-(Co, Ni)Al phase and 
γ-CoNiCrAl phase. The phases identify will be 
presented later.

the coating. The EPMA cross-sectional 
microstructure of the aluminized coating shows 
that a major β-(Co, Ni)Al phase and γ- 
CoNiCrAl phase were observed in the outer 
region. The Al-depleted γ- CoNiCrAl phase is 
identified near the surface due to the outward 
diffusion of Al to form α-Al2O3 oxide and thus 
causes further severe oxidation of the coating. 
Fig. 6 depicts the EPMA cross-sectional 
microstructure of the Pt-aluminized coating 
after150 cycles. The α-Al2O3 scale was found 
to attach firmly to the β-(Co, Ni, Pt)Al phase. 
Beneath the β-(Co, Ni, Pt)Al phase, was a 
mixed zone of β-(Co, Ni, Pt)Al phase and 
γ-CoNiCrAl phase in the center of the coating. 
The absence of a PtAl2 phase and the presence 
of a β-(Co, Ni, Pt)Al phase in Fig. 6 means that 
the former phase had transformed to the β-(Co, 
Ni, Pt)Al phase due to oxidation of the coating 
and elemental interdiffusion. The EPMA 
results of tested samples are also consistent 
with the X-ray diffraction analysis of Fig. 4. It 
should be noted that the thickness of the β-(Co, 
Ni, Pt) Al phase layer is about 80 μm even after 
150 cyclic oxidation tests.  
 
4. Conclusions  
 
The results of this study showed that 
roughness of the CoNiCrAlY coating did not 
change after aluminizing or Pt-aluminizing. 
The Pt-aluminizing process improved the 
oxidation resistance of HVOF sprayed coatings 
significantly while the aluminizing process had 
inferior effects. 
For HVOF sprayed coating, the XRD and 
EPMA results showed that thermal growth 
oxides were similar and consisted of Al2O3 and 
(Co, Ni)Al2O4 on the surface of γ-CoNiCrAl 
phase. For aluminized coating, the α-Al2O3 and 
(Co, Ni)Al2O4 oxides were detected after 100 
and 150 cycles. The EPMA analysis showed 
that the outer region consisted of a major β-(Co, 
Ni)Al phase and γ-CoNiCrAl phase after test 
for 150 cycles. The Al-depleted γ-CoNiCrAl 
phase existed preferentially near the surface 
due to the growth of α-Al2O3 and thus caused a 
lower cyclic oxidation resistance. For 
Pt-aluminized coating, even after 150 cycles, 
only α-Al2O3 scale was found to attach firmly 
to the continuous 80μm thick β-(Co, Ni, Pt)Al 
layer. Pt-aluminizing was beneficial to the 
stability of β-(Co, Ni, Pt)Al phase, which 
restricted the formation of Al-depleted γ- 
CoNiCrAl phase and thus improved the cyclic 
oxidation resistance. The morphologies of the 
growth oxide for HVOF sprayed coating, 
aluminized coating and Pt-aluminized coating 
were respectively pyramid-like, whisker, and 
flake-like configuration.
