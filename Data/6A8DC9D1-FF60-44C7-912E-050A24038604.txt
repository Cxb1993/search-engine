numerically along with a comprehensive bifurcation sequence leading to its onset.
2. Methodology
We consider an incompressible flow confined in an annulus of inner radius ri, outer
radius ro, in a infinite length h, driven by the constant rotation of the inner and outer
cylinders at angular speed ωi and ωo, respectively. Figure 1 shows the geometry and
the computational grids. The system is nondimensionalized using the gap io rrD  as
the length scale and the diffusive time across the gap /2D as the time scale, where 
is kinematic viscosity of fluid. In this study, the radius ratio ri / ro equals to 0.883, aspect
ratio h/D equals to 5.747, the governing parameters are Reynolds numbers
 /DrRe iii  and  /DrRe ooo  .
The equations governing the flow are the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations
together with initial and boundary conditions as follow.

At t=0, the initial velocities are specified as 0 wvu for oi rrr  ,
 20  , and hz0 .
The boundary conditions are the no slip condition on the inner and outer cylinders,
i.e., 0wu , and iirv  on irr for  20  and hz0 , and 0wu ,
and oorv  on orr for  20  and hz0 , and the symmetry condition on
roof and bottom, i.e., 0//  wzvzu on 0z and hz for  20 
and oi rrr  . Periodic condition is also specified in the azimuthal direction, i.e.,

In numerical iterations, the computational domain is first decomposed into a number
of grid cells, and algebraic equations are derived in each cell to approximate
The Taylor vortex flow is steady, axi-symmetric flow. A Taylor vortex flow at
300iRe and 100oRe is solved numerically and results are plotted as shown in
Figure 4. The structure of Taylor vortices is clear from contours of the radial and
azimuthal velocity components in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 4. In a Taylor vortex, a
two-cell counter-rotating flow is established and balances each other. As Re is increased
beyond about ???, the Taylor vortex flow loses stability via Hopf bifurcation, and then
the wavy Taylor vortex flow is established.
3.3 Wavy Taylor vortex flow
A wavy Taylor vortex flow at 800iRe and 0oRe is solved numerically and
results are plotted as shown in Figure 5. Wavy vortex flow is much more complicated
than Taylor vortex flow. The vortex centers defined as the point within a vortex where
the axial and radial velocities vanish in a meridional plane have radial undulations in
addition to moving axially. There is cyclic transport of significant quantities of fluid
between vortices. Furthermore, the flow field is unsteady and fully three dimensional.
3.4 Hopf bifurcations
To study the bifurcation from Couette flow to Taylor vortex flow, flows at at
200150  iRe and 100oRe are investigated carefully. For a generic Hopf
bifurcation, a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis as a
parameter is varied. According to the center manifold theorem, there exists a two
dimensional center manifold and a normal form on it describing the dynamics of the
system in a neighborhood of the bifurcation point. From the axial velocity component
plots as function of iRe as shown in Figure 6, the Hopf bifurcations are supercritical.
This is evident from the variation of the squared amplitudes of the periodic solutions with
parameters.
4. Conclusions
Direct numerical simulations are made to study the variety of flows in
Taylor-Couette system. The numerical simulations are conducted by solving the three
dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Various flows in Taylor-Couette
system such as Couette flow, Taylor vortex flow, and wavy Taylor vortex flow are solved
numerically, detailed bifurcations of these flows are also investigated. From the nonlinear
rorih
