system real power loss can be reduced and the 
reliabilities can be improved.  In this project, 
integration of Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Ant 
Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed.  The objective 
is to minimize the system real power loss with 
minimum number of switch operations by considering 
the load currents variations.  Each day is divided 
into 12 time slots.  The peak load current is used 
for each time slot.  By considering the number of 
switch operations and system real power loss 
simultaneously, the proposed approach is able to 
identify the proper switch operations so the system 
real time loss within a period of time can be 
minimized. Instead of using constant values as the 
desirability of state transition during the search 
process of ACO, application of the grey correlation 
grade is proposed.  Verification is performed using 
the loading information and the topology information 
obtained from the Outage Management System (OMS) of 
Taiwan Power Company (TPC). The results show that by 
applying the integrated EP and ACO with proposed 
desirability calculation, the distribution system 
real power loss can be reduced with proper switch 
operations for variable load currents.

1. Introduction 
Power distribution is formed by 
interconnecting many feeders through switches. 
These switches can be categorized into two 
types: normally closed sectionalized switches 
and normally opened tie switches.  By 
changing the status of these switches, or system 
reconfiguration, the topology of the distribution 
system is changed.  As a result, the operation 
conditions are altered.  The reconfiguration 
techniques are used by system operators during 
normal or emergency conditions [1].  By 
changing the topologies of distribution systems, 
the reduction of the distribution system real 
power loss and evenly distribution of the loads 
among feeders can be achieved [2]-[5].  In the 
distribution feeders, different types of loads are 
connected.  These types of loads have different 
characteristics in terms of time and power 
usages.  For example, industrial loads have 
cyclic load current patterns during weekdays 
and with low power usages during weekends or 
holidays.  On the other hand, residential loads 
have higher power demands during the morning 
and evening and weekends or holidays.  
Therefore, when reconfiguration is considered 
by the system operators, the characteristics of 
different types of loads must be considered.  
Several methods were proposed in the past 
for feeder reconfiguration problems.  For 
example, expert system was used to reduce the 
search space by utilizing heuristic rules [6]. 
Genetic algorithm applied crossover and 
mutation operators for searching the optimal 
solutions by using the evolutionary concept 
[7]-[11]. In order to identify a workable 
topology that minimizes the objectives, constant 
load currents were assumed in these researches.  
The peak load currents or installed distribution 
transformer ampacities with load factors were 
used during the reconfiguration so the results 
would not violate the conductor or transformer 
thermal constraints.  Since the load currents in 
reality vary from one hour to the next one, the 
constant load current assumption does not 
provide the optimal solutions for the objectives 
for a given period of time.  In order to reduce 
the system real power loss, switch operations 
have to be taken to alter the distribution system 
topology when the operation condition is 
changed.  Changing the status of switches 
requires some operational costs, i.e., time to 
operate the switches.  Therefore, reducing the 
system real power loss with minimum number 
of switch operations are the objectives that need 
to be considered during the distribution system 
feeder reconfiguration when load current 
variations are considered.  While these 
objectives are considered by the system 
operators, several constraints, i.e., radial 
topology, terminal voltage drop, conductor 
thermal capacity, also need to be taking into 
account.  Thus, the feeder reconfiguration 
problem is a type of combinatorial 
multi-optimization problems with equality and 
inequality constraints [14]-[15]. 
In this project, a hybrid EP-ACO algorithm 
is proposed to deal with multi-objective feeder 
reconfiguration problems with variable load 
current models.  For the variable load current 
models, the load curve of each zone is divided 
into several segments, or time slots, for each 
day.  Each segment of load curve represents 
the load at a particular period of time.  The 
proposed hybrid EP-ACO approach is a 
two-step approach.  During the first step, 
Evolutionary Programming is applied to 
generate legal chromosomes that represent a 
feeder configuration for each time slot by the 
mutation operator.  For the second step, the 
ACO is employed to generate a sequence of 
switch operations for a given number of time 
slots from these chromosomes. During the 
search process of ACO, the desirability of state 
transition was assumed a constant in many 
articles [16]-[18].  In this project, the 
desirability of state transition used in the ACO 
is calculated based on the system real power 
loss and number of switch operations when an 
3. Methodology 
The evolutionary algorithms are popular 
algorithms that are applied for engineering 
optimization problems recently. In the 
evolutionary algorithms, chromosomes 
represent the solutions.  During the process of 
the evolutionary algorithms, chromosomes are 
generated through crossover and mutation 
operators.  Selection operator is used to choose 
fitter chromosomes for the next generation. 
Elitism may be used to ensure that the fittest 
chromosome can be preserved for the next 
generation.  The Ant Colony Optimization 
(ACO) algorithm is another meta-heuristic 
optimization method that is widely used for 
discrete optimization problems.  In ACO, the 
problems are converted to graph representations 
with start node, end node and transition nodes 
between the start and end nodes.  Each ant 
searches a path from start node to the end node. 
The path identified by each ant represents a 
solution. When all ants have finished the search 
process, pheromone is updated by ants.  The 
accumulation of pheromone is a process that 
builds up the experiences by the ants. At the end 
of the search process, an optimal path from the 
start node to the end node can be identified.   
This project report considers the distribution 
system reconfiguration problem under load 
variation conditions.  Therefore, the solutions 
to the problem are the status of switches at 
different time slots.  When both the time and 
topologies of the system is considered 
simultaneously, the chromosomes become too 
complex to be handled.  In order to simplify 
the solution representation, a two stage 
approach is proposed in this project report.  
For the first stage, the EP is employed in order 
to identify required number of different system 
topologies that fulfill the constraints discussed 
in Sec. II.  These topologies are identified 
through the mutation operator that is special 
designed to satisfy the radial topology 
constraint of distribution systems.  Since the 
load curves for each load zone are different at 
different time slots, the searching of the 
required number of system topologies have to 
be performed for each time slot.  These 
topologies for different time slots are used by 
the ACO that is used to identify the best switch 
actions for a period of time, e.g. one day.  The 
EP and ACO used in this project report are 
explained as follows: 
A.  Evolutionary Programming, EP 
In EP, only mutation operator is used for 
generating new chromosomes.  In this project 
report, the EP is used to identify the topologies 
of a particular time slot based on the load curves 
of each load zone.  In order to generate 
different topologies, the EP is executed for 
many times.  Each topology identified by EP is 
considered a node of a graph used in ACO.  
The chromosome encoding scheme and 
mutation operator are discussed as follows: 
a) Chromosome Encoding: 
The topology of a distribution system is 
encoded by a chromosome for EP during the 
evolution process. Integers are used in the genes 
of a chromosome.  Each load zone within the 
distribution system is given an integer that 
represents the identity of that zone. 
Chromosomes are formed by a sequence of 
integers. Each integer in a chromosome 
represents the source zone identity of that gene.  
Therefore, the length of a chromosome is equal 
to the number of load zones of the distribution 
system.  The chromosome can be expressed as 
(9): 
Chromosome = {Cj, j=1 to number of zones }(4) 
In (4), Cj is the source zone identity of the j-th 
zone. 
b) Mutation Operator: 
The generic crossover and mutation operators 
used in traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA) are 
not suitable for the distribution system 
reconfiguration problems due to the high 
possibilities of generating illegal chromosomes.  
In order to generate legal chromosomes during 
the reproduction process, EP is applied in this 
project report with a special designed mutation 
operator. The generation of new chromosome 
using the mutation operator is described as 
follow: 
1. Select a chromosome randomly with uniform 
distribution. 
2. Select a terminal zone randomly from the 
chromosome found in step 1. 
3. Identify the neighboring zones of the 
value for the desirability of state transition. 
Calculation of the desirability of state transition 
using GCRA is described as follow: 
a) Determine the direction of objectives.  
Each objective has its optimal solution direction.  
There are three types of directions: 
Upper-bound, Lower-bound and 
Objective-bound.  For Upper-bound, the goal 
is to maximize the objective.  For 
Lower-bound, the goal is to minimize the 
objective.  For Objective-bound, the goal is to 
approach to a desired value. 
b) Determine the superior and inferior 
solutions for each objective.  Each objective 
has its best and worst values.  The collection 
of the best and the worst solution of all 
objectives forms the superior solution set (Fi
+
) 
and inferior solution set (Fi
-
) respectively.  In 
this project report, two objectives, real power 
loss and number of switch operations are used.  
For the value of the real power loss, the best and 
the worst values are 0 and initial system real 
power loss respectively.  For the value of the 
number of switch operations, the best and the 
worst values are 2 and number of switches+1 
respectively.  Thus, the superior solution set 
(F1
+
,F2
+
) is (0, 2); while the inferior solution set 
(F1
-
,F2
-
) is (System initial real power loss, 
number of installed switches+1) 
c) Normalize objectives. In order to compare 
different objectives, normalization of objectives 
needs to be performed.  Based on the direction 
of each objective determined in a)  and the 
superior and inferior solution sets defined in b), 
normalization of objectives is performed using 
(7)-(9): 
 Lower-bound : 
𝑓𝑖

 Objective-bound : 
𝑓𝑖
∗(𝑋𝑘) = 1 −
|𝑓𝑖(𝑋𝑘)−𝐹𝑖

𝐹𝑖
−−𝐹𝑖
+  (9) 
In (7)-(9), fi(xk) represents the i-th objective 
applying the k-th solution. 
d) Calculate the Grey Correlation Grade 
(GCG). (10) is used to calculate the GCG based 
on the normalized values calculated using 
(7)-(9). The GCG is the quantity value or fitness 
value of a solution.   
Γ𝑜𝑘 =
1
1+√∑ 𝜔𝑖(Δ0𝑘𝑖)
2𝑜𝑏𝑗
𝑖=1
 (10) 
In (10), Δ0𝑘𝑖 = |1 − 𝑓𝑖
∗(𝑋𝑘)| is the distance 
between the superior or inferior solution of the 
i-th objective for the k-th solution.  𝜔𝑖 are the 
weights for the objectives.  In this project 
report, the values of 𝜔𝑖 are equal, 0.5. 
An example is given in order to explain how 
the GCG is calculated.  Consider a 
three-feeder system shown in Fig. 1.  The load 
currents at three time slots are given in Table I.  
The feeder and conductor ampacity are 100A. 
The system initial real power loss is 15.7kW. 
The inferior and superior solution sets for this 
system are (15.7kW, 9) and (0, 2) respectively.  
The chromosome that represents the topology of 
the system shown in Fig. 1 is 
[9-1-5-11-4-10-6-7].  Through the EP, 6 
different topology combinations were generated 
for each time slot as shown in Table II.

Suppose an ant is located at the third node of 
the time slot, T1. When searching for a node for 
the next time slot, the desirability of state 
transition needs to be calculated for the nodes in 
the time slot, T2.  The calculation from the 
Node3 at T1 to Node3 at T2 is as follows: 
1) The cumulated system loss is 
3.5kW+3.3kW=6.8kW. Number of switch 
operations is 4. 
2) GCG calculation: 
System real power loss: 
As stated earlier, two types of the value of 
desirability of state transition are used in this 
project report.  In Case A, a constant value of 1 
is used.  In Case B, the value calculated using 
GCG is used. 
CASE A: In this case, the value of the 
desirability of state transition is a constant, 1. 
the results shown in Table V indicate that 34 
switch operations are needed for the best 
solution.  The real power loss is 6523kW for 
this case. 
CASE B: GCG is employed to calculate the 
value of the desirability of state transition 
between nodes.  The results are shown in Table 
VI.  The best solution of 27 switch operations 
with 6120kW of real power loss is obtained. 
 
From load Tables V and VI, the results show 
that a better solution is identified when GCG is 
used to calculate the value of the desirability of 
state transition under the same loading 
conditions.

In order to further validate the performance 
differences between two approaches, different 
numbers of allowable switch slots are used. The 
allowable switching slot is defined as the 
number of pre-specified time slots that are 
allowed for topological changes. For example, 
when the value of the allowable switch slot 
value is 1, it indicates that only one specified 
time slot is allowed to change the system 
topology. 
The numbers of generations to identify the 
best solution for both cases for different 
numbers of allowable switching slots are shown 
in Fig. 6. The result shows that few generations 
are needed to find the best solution when the 
GCG is used for the value of the desirability of 
state transition.  Also, it is found that more 
allowable switching slots, more generations are 
needed in order to find the best solution due to 
the increasing the complexity of the problems. 
Under different numbers of allowable switching 
slot, the results verify that the performance for 
Case B is always better than Case A.

Abstract: Electricity is one of the most popular forms of energy in modern society. In a smart house, the smart meter directly 
interacts with intelligent appliances to disaggregate the total electricity energy consumption. However, this results in high fi-
nancial costs and low monitoring reliability due to the installation of massive meters for appliances. In this paper, a 
Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM) system is proposed.  The proposed NIALM system, which integrates 
feature extraction and feature optimization methods with pattern recognition techniques, is used to identify the operation status 
of individual appliances. Both energizing and de-energizing transient current waveforms of an unidentified appliance can be 
identified through analyses of the proposed system. Different potential transient features, extracted from an acquired transient 
current waveform, form a feature space to be selected.  In pattern recognition, it is important to select the most effective fea-
tures from the original feature set and to appropriately scale them by real-valued numbers simultaneously in order to improve 
the identification accuracy and construct a small and efficient identification system. In this paper, the proposed NIALM system 
employs the Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Fisher criterion to search for the optimal sub-set of features.  After the most in-
fluential features are selected, different identifiers, including k-Nearest-Neighbor Rule (k-NNR), Back-Propagation Artificial 
Neural Network (BP-ANN) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) are used to perform load identification.  The identifica-
tion results confirm that the proposed system is able to identify the operation status of each appliance under different sin-
gle-load and multiple-load operation scenarios at different real experimental environments. Besides, this paper comments that 
the k-NNR identifier is preferred for the development of NIALM, due to its simplicity.

1  Introduction 
Electricity is one of the most popular forms of energy in 
modern society.  In order to mitigate the impact to the 
global warming and climate change, upgrading the power 
grid to a smart one that can improve the electricity energy 
usage efficiency was proposed.  In a smart grid, utilities 
provide demand response schemes for consumers to shed 
loads and to optimize the operation of power distribution 
systems such that the efficiency of the electricity energy 
consumption is improved.  Consumers enroll appliances in 
a schedule to respond to load shed instructions in exchange 
for a discount on electricity prices. Before realizing the de-
mand response, the electricity energy consumption of every 
appliance in a building has to be identified first. In buildings, 
consumers’ energy consumption can be identified using 
microprocessor-based smart meters. Each meter can be 
acted as a home gateway that directly interacts with intelli-
gent appliances to decompose the total electricity energy 
consumption. Nevertheless, a large amount of meters for 
appliances in each house must be installed. This results in 
high installation costs, high maintenance cost and low mon-
itoring reliability.  Hence, a Non-Intrusive Appliance Load 
Monitoring (NIALM) technique was proposed in the past. 
[1-12]  By installing a set of current and voltage sensors at 
the power service entry in a residence and analyzing the 
measured electrical signals, the electricity energy consump-
tion of individual appliances can be identified.  Using 
NIALM, the number of sensors installed and the financial 
costs are less than those of the conventional one. 
In this paper, an NIALM system, which combines feature 
extraction and feature optimization methods with pattern 
recognition techniques, is proposed and used to identify the 
operation status of different types of appliances. Both ener-
gizing and de-energizing transient current waveforms of an 
unidentified appliance can be identified through analyses of 
the proposed system. Different potential transient features, 
extracted from an identified transient current waveform, 
form a feature space.  Before identifying the operation 
status of each appliance, it is important to select the most 
effectual features from the potential features and to scale 
them appropriately and simultaneously. In this study, the 
proposed system utilizes the Genetic Algorithm (GA) with

Figure 2  Transient current waveforms for the energizing case. 
After iaq(t) is identified, a total of thirteen potential tran-
sient features can be extracted from it.  The maximum 
value (Ipeak) of iaq(t), the average value (Iavg) of iaq(t), the 
RMS value (Irms) of iaq(t), the form factor (FF) of iaq(t), the 
crest factor (CF) of iaq(t), the peak-to-peak value (Ipp) of 
iaq(t), the transient energy (TE), the area (Iarea) of iaq(t), and 
the transient power (TP) are the features used in this paper. 
Besides, three other features discussed in [7] are also ap-
plied here: the peak-to-average ratio (Fpta), the low-level 
ratio (rl), and the high-level ratio (rh).  Fpta is defined by 
Fpta=CFΗFF.  rl and rh are defined by rl=Sl/S, and rh=Sh/S, 
respectively. S is the total number of samples of iaq(t); Sl is 
the number of samples in which iaq(t)Љ0 is satisfied; Sh is 
the number of samples in which iaq(t)>0 is satisfied.  
These features with Et are used for load identification. The 
thirteen features are listed in Table 1.

3.1.2  De-energizing event detection and Transient fea-
ture extraction 
If the variation of current intensity, calculated from Eq. (1) 
is less than a pre-specified negative threshold, , a load 
de-energizing event is detected.  Following the detection of 
a load de-energized event, the current waveforms before and 
after the event are subtracted. Through the subtraction, the 
load de-energizing transient current waveform of an uniden-
tified appliance can be identified.  For the de-energizing 
case, the transient period, Et, is defined as one cycle.  The 
right column in Figure 3 shows the acquired transient cur-
rent waveform, iaq(t), of an unidentified one.

Figure 3  Transient current waveforms for the de-energizing case. 
For the load de-energizing case, potential features ex-
tracted from iaq(t) are the same as those of the load energiz-
ing case.  The thirteen transient features, listed in Table 1 
are potential input features; each of which may or may not 
be used as actual inputs of identifiers depending upon the 
selection result of the genetic algorithm (GA). 
 
3.2  Feature optimization and Load identification 
In load identification, it is crucial to select the most influen-
tial features out of potential features and to properly scale 
them by weights to distort the feature space simultaneously 
for constructing a small and efficient identification system.  
Several feature selection methods, such as the brute force 
exploration method, the greedy backward elimination me-
thod and the sequential forward selection method can be 
applied to find the best useful features. However, the search 
of the selection methods is NP-hard when the number of 
potential features increases. Thus, in this research, the pro-
posed system employs GA to search for the “optimal” fea-
tures. 
 
3.2.1  Optimal feature selection 
In this paper, GA [13-16], a global and stochastic search 
algorithm, is utilized to guide the search for the most useful 
features weighted simultaneously.  Figure 4 shows the 
flowchart of GA used in this paper.

first layer, the competitive layer, learns to classify feature 
vectors. The second layer, the linear layer, transforms the 
competitive layer's classes into class labels defined in ad-
vance.  Through the learning process with the error 
back-propagation algorithm, LVQ is applicable to classifi-
cation problems. 
The BP-ANN identifier is a multi-layer and feed-forward 
connectionism. The identifier’s structure includes input, 
hidden, and output layers. By introducing hidden layers, it is 
able to solve many complex engineering problems. Differ-
ent training schemes, such as variable learning rate 
back-propagation approach and one-step secant algorithm 
[16], can be used to train the BP-ANN. Through the training, 
the interconnection parameters are adjusted such that the 
errors can be minimized. 
4  Experimental Results and Discussion 
In this paper, the proposed system, which ran on a PC with 
an Intel 3.0-GHz Pentium IV CPU, is used to identify the 
operation status of appliances that include a Fan, a Fluo-
rescent Light and a Radio. Based on the experience, the 
values of , , and  are chosen to be 0.03, 0.065, and 10.0, 
respectively.  In this research, 216 single-load current 
measurements are performed at different real experimental 
environments. 138 of the measurements are used for train-
ing; while the remaining 78 of the measurements are used 
for verification. In addition, 82 multiple-load current mea-
surements are used for verification as well. Moreover, dur-
ing identification, no appliances were energized or 
de-energized simultaneously. 
Before load identification, GA with the Fisher criterion 
executes the feature optimization process. During the evolu-
tion, only the training dataset is used and it is normalized 
within [-1, 1].  The parameters used by GA are as follows. 
Firstly, the total length of each chromosome is 130. The 
population size and maximum generation are 50 and 100, 
respectively. Finally, for simplicity, the crossover and muta-
tion rates during evolution are held by constant; they are set 
to be 0.77 and 0.053, respectively. 
The GA’s results are shown in Figure 6.  Figure 6 (a) 
plots the evolution curves.  In Figure 6 (a), the solid and 
dashed lines denote the maximum and average fitness val-
ues in each generation during evolution, respectively. The 
final fitness value is 0.9949. The time is 417.78 seconds.  
After the optimization process, the most effective features 
with the weights were found to be (F3*, F7*, 
F11*)=(0.1352Irms, 0.5873Ipp, 0.6401TP).  The box-plot 
for GA over 20 runs is illustrated in Figure 6 (b). The initial 
population in each run of GA was randomly generated. The 
stand deviation is 1.14E-16. The box-plot reveals that the 
proposed feature optimization strategy is realizable and sta-
ble.

Figure 6  Results of GA 
After the optimal features are identified by GA, the three 
load identifiers were applied to identify the operation status 
of individual appliances. In this study, the performance of 
the identifiers in NIALM is compared as well. 
For k-NNR, it relies on exhaustive search to determine 
the best k value. In this experiment, the best k value in re-
spect of the highest identification accuracy was found to be 
3. 
For BP-ANN, a configuration of 3-6-5-1 was constructed. 
Log-sigmoid-type transfer function was used as the activa-
tion function for all neurons in hidden and output layers. 
The gradient descent algorithm with the momentum term 
and adaptive learning rate back-propagation strategy with 
the sum-squared error performance index was applied to 
train the network. Finally, the initial interconnection para-
meters were generated based on the Nguyen-Window initia-
lization method [17]. 
For LVQ, the number of hidden neurons was 6. The types 
of activation functions used in first and second layers were 
competitive-type and linear-type transfer functions, respec-
tively. The LVQ2.1-type weight learning algorithm with the 
mean-squared error performance index was applied to train 
the identifier. 
Figure 8 and Table 2 show the training results and identi-
fication results of the three load identifiers, respectively. As 
the results shown in Table 2, the overall recognition accu-
racy of all the identifiers for the test case is higher than 
85.6%.  The overall recognition accuracy of k-NNR and 
BP-ANN for the test case is 97.5% and 95%, respectively. 
Although the generalization of both k-NNR and BP-ANN is 
similar, k-NNR is superior to BP-ANN in the development 
of NIALM, due to its simplicity in computation and imple-
mentation.
