英文摘要
The present research developed suitable methods to prepare polyvinylidenefluoride
(PVDF) membranes and to modify their surface properties, so that low-fouling PVDF
membranes can be obtained. In addition, the mechanism responsible for the
low-fouling property was investigated. On one hand, in the aspect of membrane
morphology control, we found that highly porous PVDF membranes with adequate
mechanical strength for filtration experiments could be fabricated, by using the
vapor-induced phase separation method, together with adjusting the dissolution
temperature for preparation of the casting solution. On the other hand, in the aspect of
surface modification, a combination of ozone activation with ATRP (atom transfer
radical polymerization) reaction was employed to graft PEGMA (Poly(ethylene glycol)
methacrylate) on PVDF membranes, resulting in a decrease in irreversible fouling for
protein filtration. Also, it was shown that the anti-fouling effect stemmed from the
increase in the degree of hydration, which lowered the absorption of protein on the
membrane surface.
1一、計畫緣由與目的
在膜過濾程序中，操作上最大的問題是濾速會隨時間衰減(flux decline)。此
問題會導致過濾時間大幅延長，或過濾壓力大幅提高，甚至需要更換濾膜來因
應，使得操作成本大幅增加，而限制了膜過濾技術的實用性。造成濾速衰減的主
因是濃度極化現象(concentration polarization)與結垢現象(fouling)[1]，其中濃度極
化所產生的濾速衰減是可逆的， 一般可藉由流場的設計來解決，而結垢效應則
是不可逆的，所造成的影響較大，且較不容易處理[2]。所謂結垢是指在膜過濾
過程中，粒子因物理或化學作用吸附或沉積於膜孔內或膜面上，膜孔被阻塞而導
致濾速衰減 [1,2] 。結垢會發生在各種膜過濾程序中，包含了微過濾
(microfiltration)，超過濾(ultrafiltration)，奈米過濾(nanofiltration)及逆滲透(reverse
osmosis)。在微過濾中常會因懸浮粒子或細胞阻塞在膜孔或膜面上導致濾速衰減
[3]，超過濾則常因膠體粒子(如蛋白質)的吸附或沉積而產生結垢[4]，當奈米過濾
應用在水處理上，則常會因水中自然有機物(natural organic matter)的吸附而發生
問題[5]，至於逆滲透，則會因鹽類沉積或生物膜的產生而導致膜的操作期限變
短[6]。由於結垢的問題是膜過濾程序是否具實用性的關鍵點，所以如何減少結
垢產生，成為膜過濾相關研究中最主要的課題。
要減少結垢產生，常用的方法有利用前處理來移除容易結垢的粒子；透過流
場設計或引進其他機制(如電場或超音波)來減少粒子沉積於膜上的機會；採用適
當頻率及方法來清洗濾膜，移除沉積粒子；以及降低膜材與結垢物間的親和性來
減少結垢物在膜上的吸附與沉積[7]。上述方法中，降低結垢物在膜上的吸附是
本子計畫的主要方向，其餘方法則是其他子計畫的研究主軸。要改變結垢物在膜
上的吸附現象，可以改變作用力產生的環境(如進料液的 pH 值、離子強度)，或
是改變膜材的性質，本計畫所採用的方法是後者：即是透過改變膜材的性質，來
降低結垢物在膜上的吸附，藉以減少結垢的產生。
要改變膜材對結垢物的吸附性，最直接的方法是採用與結垢物親和性低的材
3討論 PVDF 膜結構的控制技術，第ニ部分討論改質方法。其中改質的方法含括有
電漿改質及臭氧活化技術，不過因受限於本實驗室的設備，電漿改質雖然可以進
行，但改質後膜的機械強度太差，無法進行後續過濾實驗，所以改質方法的成果
以討論臭氧活化技術為主。本報告也會涵括臭氧活化後 PVDF 膜防垢效果的評
估，並簡單討論其產生防垢效果的機制。雖然報告中所有的成果均是以 PVDF 為
材質，但相信本計畫所發展出的膜結構控制及材料改質技術，經調整後，亦可適
用於其他材質。
5所示，針對 20 wt%的 PVDF/NMP 系統，將其溶解在最小溶解溫度、40、45、50、
60、80 及 110 度，分別約需要 7-9 天、2 天、1 天、12 小時、8 小時、6 小時及 4
小時以確保完全溶解。完全溶解後，所有溶液均放置於 25 度下 3 小時，準備用
於後續的薄膜製備。

薄膜的製備
使用蒸氣誘導式相分離法(vapour-induced phase separation, VIPS)搭配濕式法
(wet method)制備薄膜。首先取出適量的高分子溶液後放置在玻璃板上，利用高
度為 250μm刮刀刮出均勻的鑄膜，將此鑄膜放在有著固定溫濕度的濕空氣中，
以吸收水氣誘導相分離的發生，因此稱之為蒸氣誘導式相分離，在此所使用的濕
空氣環境為 25 度及 70%的相對濕度，整體環境的溫度控制是由外面的加熱線
圈，而整體的濕度則是由飽和的鹽水溶液及乾空氣所控制的，當鑄膜於濕空氣中
暴露適當時間(20min、60min 及 4day)後，則浸入於 25 度的水槽以固定結構，並
放置於水槽內一天，使溶劑可以完全交換出來，之後將薄膜固定在玻璃板上，放
置在周圍環境使薄膜乾燥，以進行後續的分析。
薄膜表面形態的分析及抗張強度的測試
在此以場發射電子顯微鏡(cold field emission scanning electron microscope SEM,
730 度。
另外亦以單一粒子的沉降描述溶液的流動性質變化。將 20 wt%的 PVDF/NMP
分別於 33 及 60 度下溶解完全後，再分別添加重量百分比為 0、0.5、1、1.5 及 2
wt%的水，且根據文獻中 PVDF/NMP/water 的相圖結果指出，所以的水量添加，
皆使組成仍保持在相分離區外。隨後將添加水的高分子溶液放置在 25 度的環境
下，以 25 rpm 的攪拌速度持續混合 3 到 4 小時，使其完全混合均勻後，在相對
濕度低於 20 %的環境下，將高分子溶液注入長 20cm，內徑 0.9 cm 的玻璃管內，
再靜制一小時使氣泡完全被移除後，放入一直徑為 0.8 cm，重量為 2±0.05 g 的鋼
珠球，密封此玻璃管並每 24 小時量測此粒子沉降時所需的掉落時間，在此藉由
鋼珠球在 25 度的環境下，於不同高分子溶液內，降落 15 cm 的掉落時間來判斷
高分子溶液的流動性質。
2.2改質方法
電漿改質
本研究使用的電漿機台是鐘罩式高周波電漿反應器(bell-jar type ratio frequency
plasma reactor)，設備如 Fig. 2.1 所示。調整以下的操作變數來進行改質：
1.電漿瓦數(Wf)：為設定瓦數-反射瓦數
2.真空度(torr)：以 pump 抽氣或流量大小加以調節。可將真空度視為腔體內粒
子的濃度，通常維持在較高的真空度約 0.05 torr，也就是腔體內保持低濃度，因
為在低濃度及足夠的瓦數下，氣體較有機會受到電子活化而改質膜面。
3.氣體流量(sccm)：與抽氣 pump 配合調節真空度，並決定氣體分子在腔體內的
滯留時間。
4.改質時間(min)：即暴露於電漿下的時間，並非時間越長越好，隨時間增加離
子轟擊效應可能增強，使得原本活化之表面受到離子之蝕刻效應而消失。
9甲醇中，再以蒸餾水清洗。熱誘導接枝反應的臭氧活化步驟與上述相同，活化後
之 PVDF 膜則利用參考文獻[20]所描述的步驟進行接枝，詳細過程不在此贅述。
2.3 過濾實驗
進行過濾實驗時，採用 Fig. 2.3 的過濾裝置，將圖中的閥關閉時，可進行
deadend 過濾，開啟時則可進行掃流過濾，在定壓操作下量測濾速，觀察接枝前
後濾速衰減的情形有何不同。選定牛血清蛋白(bovine serum albumin, BSA)來研究
蛋白質結垢的情形。

三、結果與討論
分為四個部分來討論本計畫之研究成果：第一部分是膜結構的控制；第ニ部
分討論電漿改質；第三部分是臭氧接枝，第四部分則是薄膜改質前後，過濾效能
的評估。
3.1膜結構的控制
本研究使用蒸氣誘導式相分離法(VIPS)製備 PVDF 薄膜，此法是於
1992 年被提出的，在此製程中，非溶劑(通常為水)被誘導成氣相並且被鑄膜所吸
收，引發鑄膜中的非溶劑濃度增加進而達到相分離。相較於濕式法，蒸氣誘導式
相分離法中，溶劑與非溶劑的交換速度慢，因此實驗所使用的薄膜製備於較慢質
傳速度下，並探討鑄膜液的溶解溫度對於薄膜的形態及結晶行為的影響。
溶解溫度對薄膜表面形態的影響
溶解溫度對薄膜形態的影響如 Figs. 3.1.1 及 3.1.2 所示，由此 SEM 圖可發現
即使在相同的成膜條件及相同的製膜程序下，薄膜表面形態受到溶解溫度影響甚
鉅。在此 VIPS 的製程中，所有的鑄膜皆被暴露於溫度為 25 度，相對濕度為 70%
的空氣中吸收水氣 20 分鐘。由 Fig. 3.1.1 可發現，將 PVDF/NMP 溶液溶解於 33
±1 度，持續攪拌溶解 7 至 9 天，薄膜表面是由相互聯通的高分子蕾絲及孔洞所
構成的多孔且雙連續的結構，由 SEM 觀察表面(×一萬倍)，其表面孔洞的直徑大
小約為 0.6μm，而蕾絲狀高分子的寬度約為 0.3μm；在較高的 SEM 倍率底下(×
三萬倍)，可以在網狀高分子的交點中觀察到細微的顆粒結構，而連結這些顆粒
結構的絲狀高分子表面平滑，沒有顯著的細微結構在絲狀高分子表面上，其中出
現在絲狀高分子交點的細微顆粒的直徑約為 0.4μm。進一步地比較薄膜表面及底
面形態的差異，除了表面粗糙度及表面細微粒子的大小有些許差異外，其表面結

如圖 Fig. 3.1.4(a) 所示，溶解溫度為 33±1 度的 PVDF/NMP 系統下討暴露時
間對膜結構的影響，發現即便將鑄膜暴露於相同溫濕度中吸收水氣一小時，膜結
構仍可維持雙連續結構，但可表面的絲狀結構變得較為密集，且此細微顆粒小幅
成長到 0.5μm，薄膜厚度由 85±3 μm 減少至 64±3μm；當鑄膜於相同溫濕度底
下暴露四天後，原本白色的薄膜轉變為半透明樣，薄膜厚度亦減少至 20±3μm，
由表面 SEM 圖可發現其孔洞及孔隙度顯著地降低，而顆粒約略為持在 0.5μm 的
大小，由此推論，針對最低溶解溫度的系統，在 VIPS 法的相分離過程中，高分
子會維持其雙連續結構，顆粒結構不易隨時間成長，而整體形態會收縮成緻密且
透明的薄膜。
溶解溫度對結晶型態的影響
在此所使用的 PVDF 高分子顆粒，其結晶度為 40%，其中α態及β態的比例
17
使將兩種溶液溶解在 60 度下，使用 NMP 為溶劑的系統，其薄膜呈現較大的顆
粒，由此可發現溶解能力(溶解度)、溶解溫度及顆粒直徑，似乎有密不可分的關
係。
最小溶解溫度(Minimum Dissolution temperature, MDT)及臨界溶解溫度(Critical
Dissolution Temperature, CDT)
Fig. 3.1.7 為隨著不同暴露時間，溶解溫度對膜表面顆粒直徑的影響，由圖可
觀察到薄膜內的顆粒直徑隨著溶解溫度的增加分別以兩種成長速度上升，在溶解
溫度為 33±1 到 40 度之間，顆粒大小可由 0.5 成長到 0.8μm，其成長速度不顯著，
在此溫度區間，顆粒大小不會隨著暴露時間而增加，薄膜僅隨著在濕空氣中的暴
露時間增加至四天，而逐漸轉為半透明薄膜。當溶解溫度為 45 度時，顆粒大小
突然倍增至 1.5 μm，隨後溫度增加從 45 度到 110 度，高分子直徑皆顯著且穩定
地成長。由於相較於濕式法，蒸氣誘導式相分離法的質傳速度較慢 35，故在吸收
水氣而相分離的過程中，鑄模組成似乎比較有機會停留在結晶區，因此在進入液
液相分離區之前，薄膜形態可先由結晶區所主導，使高分子鏈有機會合併成顆粒
結構。而本研究發現，高分子鏈是否合併成顆粒的行為除了決定於質傳速度，亦
受到溶解溫度的影響。
溶解溫度為 45 度時，似乎為顆粒發展的轉折點。當溶解溫度操作在 45 度以
上時，在相分離的過程中，高分子鏈比較傾向合併成顆粒；當溶解溫度操作在
45 度以下時，高分子鏈不易合併成顆粒，因此所形成的顆粒較小且不顯著。根
據以上的現象，在此針對 20 wt%的 PVDF/NMP 系統，定義 45 度為其臨界溶解
溫度(CDT)用以認定薄膜形態。藉由以上結果可知，將溶解溫度操作在 MDT 及
CDT 之間，PVDF 薄膜主要由雙連續結構及微小顆粒結構所組成的；當溶解溫度
大於 CDT 時，PVDF 膜主要由互相連結的顆粒所構成的，因此 MDT 及 CDT 為
控制 PVDF 薄膜結構的指標。
針對 PVDF/NMP 及 PVDF/DMF 兩系統，探討高分子濃度對 CDT 及 MDT
19
在充滿高分子溶液的玻璃管內的掉落時間，測試高分子溶液的流動性質，並藉由
在室溫下預先加水(0 到 2wt%)於高分子溶液的方式，比較不同吸水程度的高分子
溶液，其流動性質的變化。
如表 3 所示，在一開始時(t=0)除了預先加水 2wt%的系統，隨著增加溶解溫
度及增加水量由 0 到 1.5wt%，掉落時間相似，沒有太大的差異，但當預先加水
2wt%的系統在實驗一開始時，兩溶解溫度之間的掉落時間有些許的差異。如 Fig.
3.1.10 所示，在不同溶解溫度下(33±1 及 60 度)，鋼珠球掉落時間隨天數的變化，
不難發現隨著天數的增加，對於有預先加水的系統，掉落時間有顯著的差異。當
溶解溫度為 60 度時，預先加水 0 到 1wt%的系統，在量測的 14 天內，其沉降時
間增加幅度小於 10%，似乎意味著水的存在對溶液的流動性沒有顯著的影響 溶
液仍保持在其原本的流動能力，隨著預先加水的水量增至 1.5 及 2wt%，沉降時
間在 5 天內約略增加 10%，5 天之後，沉降時間才明顯激增。

相對地，針對溶解溫度為 33±1 度的系統，在沒有預先天加水的系統上，掉
落時間沒有太大的變化，但隨著越多的預先添加的水量，掉落時間迅速增加。針
對預先加水 0.5wt%的系統，在 6 天之內掉落時間成長幅度大於 10%以上，且對
於預先加水 1、1.5 及 2wt%的系統，掉落時間可以在 9 天、3 天及 1 天內增加至
高於 50%。因此我們推論在不同溶解溫度下的溶液，即便有任何微觀上的差異，

3.2電漿改質
膜材製備
本研究使用的膜材是實驗室自行製備的 Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)薄
膜，型號為 Kynar pellets 760，分子量約 440,000。使用的製備程序是蒸氣誘導式
相分離法(VIPS)，將高分子溶液刮在玻璃板後置於 45℃ 70%相對溼度 5 分鐘後，
接著置入水槽一天，最後於 4℃環境下乾燥一天。
Fig. 3.2.1 為 PVDF 薄膜在掃描式電子顯微鏡(SEM)下觀察的影像，由 SEM
可看到，整片薄膜是屬於對稱的雙連續結構。其測得的膜厚約 140micron，孔隙
度約 80%，接觸角約為 135°。
表面活化
電漿的使用，必須決定一些必要的參數：功率、腔體壓力、氣體流量、兩電
極間距以及載台與下電極間距。為方便觀察腔體內電漿之穩定性及均勻性，選擇
會放出紅光的氮氣電漿操作。當氮氣電漿以下方進氣口進氣、電極高度為 2cm、
電極間距為 10cm、瓦數為 20Wf，結果呈現在流量為 10 及 20sccm 發現腔體最上
方凹陷處也出現電漿，凹陷處至電極間也有淡淡的電漿，此兩流量的電漿分布較
不理想，最好的狀況應該為電漿均勻集中在電極之間。而當流量為 15sccm、電
極間距為 10cm、真空度為 0.055torr、瓦數為 20Wf，發現電極高度為 0、1、2、
3、3.5 及 4cm 時，腔體上方仍出現電漿，腔體內電漿分布在兩電極之間，但中
間部份較電極兩端稍淡。穩定性的部份以肉眼觀察發現電漿啟動後，其內部狀態
穩定，很少發生閃爍或變動。因此決定操作條件如下表：
氣體 氧氣
腔體壓力 0.055torr
氣體流量 15sccm
33
處理後的膜，上表面的雙連續結構被破壞了許多。在電漿系統內，離子和自由基
都會轟擊膜材的表面，雖然自由基能夠活化膜材，但是離子卻會破壞表面的化學
鍵，造成蝕刻效應。
在電漿產生時，每種碰撞都會同時產生，很難屏除某一種效應，因此在改善
親水性時，機械強度也會被破壞。在過濾操作中，膜的機械強度要能夠承受相當
的壓差，機械強度不佳的膜會破裂而造成失效，故蝕刻是要被盡量避免的效應。
目前研究碰到的障礙是無法單獨的避免掉蝕刻，當降低電漿處理的時間、施
加功率，伴隨而來的是接觸角下降幅度不大；而文獻中指出遠距式電漿反應器
(remote plasma reactor)，相較於直立式反應器多了一項操作變數，就是 sample 與
電極的橫向距離，因為離子消散速度比自由基快，當遠距式電漿開始轟擊，若將
sample 放的較遠，主要造成蝕刻效果的離子無法達到 sample 位置，只有自由基
得以衝撞 sample 且減低離子蝕刻已產生的活性基團，故使蝕刻效應較小，活化
效果較佳。然而本研究用的鐘罩式機台，載台和電極之間的距離最多只能拉到
20 公分，相較遠距式電漿可達 1 至 2 公尺的距離，操作範圍並不大，因此無法
有效的避免蝕刻。

3.3臭氧活化 PVDF膜+ATRP接枝
本研究採用 FTIR/ATR 來證實用前述方法可成功將 PEGMA 接枝於 PVDF 膜
面上。若 PEGMA 接枝在 PVDF 膜面上，PEGMA 含有 C=O 官能基，在 IR 圖譜
1727 cm-1 處會有吸收峰出現。Fig. 3.3.1 為未接枝及用 ATRP 法接枝後 PVDF 膜
面的 IR 圖譜，可看出接枝前在 1727 cm-1 處並無吸收峰，而在接枝後，就可以觀
察到吸收峰，且吸收峰高度隨接枝反應時間之增加而提高，可證實 PEGMA 確接
枝在 PVDF 膜面上。
我們也進行 PEGMA 接枝量的量測，利用接枝前後膜重的改變來算出接枝
的重量，進行計算接枝密度(單位膜面積之接枝量；mg/ cm2)。接枝密度與接枝反
應時間的關係描述於 Fig. 3.3.2 中，可看出接枝密度隨反應時間增加而趨於一定
值。Fig. 3.3.2 中兩條線分別代表兩種接枝方法，PVDF-g-PEGMA#1 代表熱誘導
接枝法，而 PVDF-g-PEGMA#2 代表 ATRP 接枝法，結果顯示 ATRP 之接枝速率
高於熱接枝法，且接枝量也大幅提升。可見本研究所採用的 ATRP 法較文獻上的
熱接枝法，有較高的接枝效率。
ATRP 接枝的卓越處在於接枝反應的可控制性及均勻性。本研究用 AFM(原
子力顯微鏡)來觀察接枝的均勻性。Fig. 3.3.3 為未接枝、以熱接枝法接枝
PEGMA、及用 ATRP 接枝 PEGMA 之 PVDF 膜面的 AFM 圖，圖中列出各表面
的 RMS(root mean square，均方根)表面粗糙度( roughness)。RMS 表面粗糙度可
用來代表膜面的均勻性。未接枝的 PVDF 膜面粗糙度為 39.4nm，熱接枝 PEGMA
之 PVDF 膜面粗糙度約大於 49nm，而以 ATRP 接枝 PEGMA 之 PVDF 膜面粗糙
度約為 40nm。以 ATRP 接枝的膜面與未接枝的膜面相較，均勻性差不多，但以
熱接枝方式所產生的膜面均勻性就不如前二者。
PVDF 為疏水性材質，接枝後之表面親水性會提升。表面親疏水性可用水
與表面之接觸角來評估，Fig. 3.3.4 描述 PVDF 膜面接觸角與接枝密度的關聯性。
可看出接枝後表面接觸角確下降，代表材料表面變得較為親水，但接枝密度超過

3.4薄膜改質前後過濾效能的評估。
濾速衰減分析
在進行過濾時(過濾裝置如 Fig. 2.3 所示)，會因進料中的粒子(或溶質)堆積在
膜上或膜孔中而產生濾速衰減的現象。本研究亦進行 PEGMA 接枝前後之濾速分
析，來評估接枝對濾速衰減現象的影響。實驗分為三個階段：第一階段是以去離
子水進行過濾，量測膜未阻塞前的過濾通量(濾速)，以 Jwo 表示；第二階段是以
濃度為 1.0 mg/ml 的牛血清蛋白(BSA)水溶液進行過濾，量測過濾兩小時後的濾
速(以 Jpo 表示)，代表 PVDF 被阻塞後的濾速；第三階段是將第二階段所用的濾
膜以純水清洗後，再重新量測去離子水的濾速(以 Jw1 表示)，評估阻塞濾膜經清
洗後，濾速回復的情形。
研究中對未接枝、以熱接枝方式接枝 PEGMA(反應時間 12 hr)，及以 ATRP
方式接枝 PEGMA(反應時間 12 hr)之 PVDF 膜分別進行上述濾速分析，結果如
Fig. 3.4.1 所示。在第一階段中，三種膜的純水濾速並不相同，未接枝膜之濾速最
高，接枝量高(ATRP 接枝)之濾膜濾速較低，顯見接枝過程引入了阻力使得濾速
降低(此部分日後應可藉由控制接枝量來改善)。但以 BSA 水溶液過濾後，三種
膜的通量都差不多，應是蛋白質覆蓋了膜面，此蛋白質覆蓋層成為過濾阻力的最
大來源。清洗之後再度量測純水過濾通量，發現三種膜的濾速回復情形並不相
同，PEGMA 接枝量高的 PVDF 膜，濾速回復情形亦較佳。
為進一步定量分析 PVDF 膜清洗之後濾速回復的情形，定義以下參數：RFR、Rt、
Rr、Rir。RFR 是代表濾膜經清洗後濾速回復的比率：

四、結論
本計畫發展出適當的 PVDF 製膜技術及改質方法，製備出低結垢過濾膜，並
對其產生防垢效果的機制進行初步探討。
在 PVDF 膜結構的控制技術方面，本研究發現利用蒸氣誘導式相分離法(VIPS)
所製備的薄膜，其薄膜表面形態可經由溶解溫度加以控制，隨著溶解溫度操作在
最小可完全溶解均勻的溫度(MDT)到 110 度，薄膜表面形態可由雙連續結構逐漸
發展至顆粒狀結構，且針對膜表面形態、顆粒大小的發展及結晶的演變的轉折，
可以定義出臨界溶解溫度(CDT)。當溶解溫度操作在 MDT 及 CDT 之間，薄膜表
面為雙連續的多孔結構，且具有適當的機械強度；當溶解溫度操作在 CDT 以上
時，薄膜主要由顆粒結構所組成的，且此顆粒大小會隨溶解溫度的增加而成長。
研究中也發現薄膜結構與結晶型態間有十分密切的關聯性，ニ者均受溶解溫度的
影響。利用本研究所發展的技術，可成功製備出具有適當機械強度的高孔隙度低
PVDF 膜，適用於膜過濾程序。
在材料改質方法上，本計劃評估了電漿改質及臭氧活化技術。受限於本實驗
室的設備，電漿改質雖然可以進行，但改質後膜的機械強度太差，無法進行後續
過濾實驗，所以改質方法的成果以討論臭氧活化技術為主。研究結果顯示：本研
究所採用的臭氧活化並結合 ATRP 反應的方法，可有效的將 PEGMA 接枝在
PVDF 膜面上；而藉由控制反應的時間，可調控膜面的接枝密度，進而調控膜面
的含水率；提高膜材表面的含水率可以降低蛋白質的吸附，減少不可逆的結垢，
只要利用水清洗，即可回復過濾過程中降低的濾速。

New Insight in Tuning the Morphology of poly(vinylidene) fluoride
Membranes

movement in the dope was more difficult, domain nucleation and growth was limited
and membranes with bi-continuous structure could thus form. Also, αtype PVDF
crystals occurred since they inclined to form with restricted chain movement. With
the knowledge of the effects of polymer dissolution temperature, one can tailor the
PVDF membrane morphology by adjusting the polymer dissolution conditions.

solid-liquid demixing. The former is related to the miscibility of the system. With
decreasing the miscibility, the blend becomes unstable and undergoes liquid-liquid
phase separation5. The solid-liquid demixing is (crystallization) considered to occur in
two steps: primary nucleation of crystals and their subsequent growth6. In general,
liquid-liquid demixing will usually precede crystallization even if solid-liquid demixing
is favored thermodynamically7.
With PVDF, membranes exhibit different morphologies according to the
predominant demixing mechanism8, 9. On one hand, if phase separation is dominated
by liquid-liquid demixing, it often leads to asymmetric membranes with a skin layer
and cellular sub-layer whose pores are surrounded by a solid polymer-rich phase. On
the other hand, the solid-liquid demixing results in uniform microporous membranes
with interlinked spherulites, which are spherical aggregates of crystal. In order to get
more information on this demixing and crystallization step, phase diagrams of
PVDF/DMF/water and PVDF/DMF/1-octanol have been previously investigated 10, 11.
The competition between the two demixing processes could be affected by
membranes preparation parameters such as the composition of casting solution10,
12-17 (solvency of solvent, adding non-solvent and concentration), the exposure
conditions13, harshness of precipitation bath13, 14, precipitation temperature16, 18, 19
and different substrates20. All these parameters have been used to control the
sequence of the two formation mechanisms by influencing the mass transfer.
Generally, the diffusion trajectory crosses the crystallization region quickly or enters
the liquid-liquid demixing region first by raising precipitation temperature; the
liquid-liquid demixing dominated membrane formation considering the asymmetric
morphology with α and β types crystallites. When the compositions had
sufficient time in crystallization region, the membrane shows spherical
microstructures with β type crystallites21, 22.

Experiments
2.3 Materials
Poly(vinylidene fluoride)(Kynar 760, Elf Atochem, melt viscosity= 23~29 Kps at
232 °C, Mw=444,000 g/mole) was purchased in pellet form. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP, Fluka, reagent grade, ≧98 wt%, with molecular sieve, H2O ≦0.01%, d=1.033
g/ml) and N,M-dimethylformamide (DMF, Fluka, reagent grade, ≧ 99.8 wt%,
d=0.948 g/ml) were used as solvent. Distilled-deionized water was used as
non-solvent for PVDF. All chemicals were used as received without further
purification.
2.4 Preparation of polymer solution
PVDF was dissolved in the different solvent to form a 12 to 22 wt% solution. All
polymer solutions were under continuous agitation (25 rpm) using a magnetic stirrer
(3.5 cm in length) in a hermetically sealed glass flask. Solutions were dissolved at the
minimum and various temperatures separately with a heating plate. The minimum
temperature was determined by during 10 days in which lowest available dissolution
temperature, we can get homogeneous casting solution. Its homogeneity was
determined by uniformity of membranes. Uniformity of membranes was
characterized by SEM to make sure morphology was uniform and there was no
observable nodule on surface. At the lower temperature, it took longer time become
homogeneously transparent. As seen in Table 1, the time for getting homogeneous
solution varied with dissolution temperature for 20 wt% PVDF/NMP system dissolved
at minimum dissolution temperature, 40, 45, 50, 60, 80 and 110 °C. All solutions
were cooled to 25 °C, stood for 3 hr for membrane preparation.
2.5 Preparation of membranes by phase separation
PVDF membranes were prepared by vapour-induced phase separation
/immersion-precipitation method. All appropriate amount of dope solutions were
61
vibration band at 840 cm-1 is assigned to β type. The fraction ofαand β types
were determined by comparing the absorbance of vibration band peaks of the
samples at 840 and 763 cm-1. One of PVDF crystal, γ, has same vibration band at
840 cm-1, but its melting peak is about 179 and 188 oC30, 31. All membranes were
identified by DSC at a heating rate of 10 oC/min, the DSC curves did not display the
melt endotherms corresponding to this phase. Only one peak was observed at 168
and a shoulder at 155 oC, corresponding to the melt of the α or βcrystals.
2.8 Rheological characterization of polymer solution
Rheological characterization was determined by two methods, viscoelastic
measurement by cone and plate rheometer and sedimentation of signal steel
particle.
The viscosity and elasticity of solutions dissolved at different temperature (33 to
110 oC) were determined by DV-III cone and plate rheometer (Brookfield). The
measured mode was dynamic model operated in 100 rad/s of frequency at 30 oC.
Solution mobility was described by single particle sedimentation method. After
dissolution process, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 wt% water was added into 20 wt% PVDF/NMP
solutions which dissolved at 33 and 60 oC. According the phase diagram of
PVDF/NMP/water32, all solutions were located outside of all phase separation regions.
Next, solutions were kept under continuous agitation (25 rpm) at 25 oC for 5 hr. All
solution could become homogeneously transparent during 3~4 hr. Next, solutions
were injected into glass tubes with 0.9 cm in ID and 20 cm in length, and then stood
for 1 hr to remove the bubble under relative humidity was low than 20%. The steel
balls with diameter of 0.8 cm and 2±0.05 g in weight were deposed inside. Glass
tubes filling different solution were sealed for single particle sedimentation
measurement per 24 hr. The sedimentation time was decided by the time of single
steel ball falling 15 cm at 25 oC.

3 Results and Discussion
In this work, PVDF membranes was prepared via vapour-induced phase
separation (VIPS) method first patented in 199233 from solutions dissolved at
different temperature. During this process, the non-solvent (usually water) is
introduced by gas phase and absorbed by a casting film resulting in phase separation.
Comparison with IP, the exchange between solvent and non-solvent is slow.
Therefore, membranes were formed at lower mass and investigated the influence of
dissolution temperature on morphology and crystallization.
3.1 Dissolution temperature effect on Morphology
The effect of dissolution temperature demonstrated in Figure 1~2 indicates that
morphology of PVDF membrane may be controlled by the intial temperature of PVDF
dissolution in NMP. All membranes were exposed to air for 20 minutes at 25 oC and
the relative humidity was 70%. As shown in Figure 1, for the case of PVDF dissolved
in NMP at 33±1 oC for 7-9 days, the top surface of the membrane is porous with
bi-continuous microstructure composed of interconnected lacy polymers and pores.
The pore size (???) is in the order of 0.6 μm in diameter and the lace-like polymer
width is about 0.3 μm. Under higher magnification (×30k), some spherical particles
can be identified in intersections of the lace-like polymer network. Particles are
about 0.4 μm in diameter. Comparing top and bottom surface, no difference in the
morphology is noticed. Symmetric membrane is observed (Figure 1(d)) in results of a
constant thickness of about 85±3 μm.
For 20wt% PVDF/NMP system, the minimum dissolution temperature was 33±1
oC. At 33±1 oC, PVDF in NMP (20 wt%) dissolution step lasts in 7 to 9 days . As seen
in Figure 2, there was no significant dissolution time effect on dissolution process
after solution was dissolved entirely at same temperature. Waiting up to 14 days at
65
when PVDF solution was casted on a substrate and immersed in a coagulation bath,
the final crystalline type depends on the coagulation temperature. In this
contribution, the crystalline type is also dependant of the dissolution temperature.
As shown in Figure 5, FTIR analysis reveals that when dissolution temperature is
close to minimum dissolution temperature (33°C), PVDF membrane is composed of
60% of α type and 40% of β type. At this stage, it’s important to mention that 
the exposing time doesn’thave significant effect on the crystalline type (Figure 5), so
the ratios between α and β type are similar with exposing time of 20 min, 1hr
and 4 days. A sharp decrease of the ratio α/β is observed between 33 and 45°C
before reaching a plateau at 10-20 % of β- type crystals. In conclusion, the
predominance of the crystal type is strongly affected by the dissolution temperature.
3.3 Solvency effect
To measure the impact of solvency on these observations, PVDF in DMF systems
(20wt%) has been studied. According the litterature34, the total solubility parameter
of NMP and DMF were 22.9 and 24.8 MPa1/2. The total solubility parameter of PVDF
was 23.2 identified by limiting viscosity at 20 oC (Who did it??). DMF has weaker
solvency for PVDF compared to NMP, and therefore we couldn’t dissolve PVDF in
DMF easily. The minimum dissolution temperature is increased from 33 to 44°C by
switching to DMF. The 20wt% PVDF/DMF just could be dissolved completely above
44 oC. Even though solutions were dissolved at same temperature (60 oC), the NMP
system had bigger spherulites than the DMF system.
In this case, the minimum dissolution temperature is about 44 oC instead of 33
°C with NMP. Membrane morphology remains the same with mainly lacy-like
polymers with small particles located at the connection points. Pore size is about 0.3
67
chains couldn’t coarsen easily below 45 oC which resulting in smaller spherules
(granules). By this phenomenon, I would like to identify the 45 oC as critical
dissolution temperature to recognize membrane morphology. The membranes were
composed of bi-continuous lacy polymer and smaller granules when dissolution
temperature was controlled between MDT and CDT; the membranes were composed
of inter-connective spherulites above CDT.
As seen in Figure 8, the influence of polymer concentration on minimum and
critical dissolution temperature for PVDF/NMP and PVDF/DMF system, it described in
which conditions we could prepare bi-continuous and symmetric membranes. No
matter which solvent we used, the MDT and the CDT increased with polymer
concentration. The PVDF/DMF system needed higher MDT and CDT than PVDF/NMP
system. It seems the MDT and CDT were related to solvency. With lower solvency
(higher concentration and more difference of solubility parameter), higher
dissolution temperature is necessary to dissolve solutions completely and control the
structure. The range between MDT and CDT is an index to prepare bi-continuous
membranes. And the PVDF/NMP system had huger operated range than the
PVDF/DMF system above 16wt%. When the polymer concentration is lower than
16wt%, it was difficult to distinguish the MDT and CDT resulted in spherular
membrane.
3.5 Solution mobility
In our study, we could control membrane morphology by the irregular method,
dissolution temperature. According to the reports36-38, gelation could occur even at
very low gel formation concentration and the gelation existed in core and shell
structure. Therefore, we supposed there are some differences in chain conformation
associated the dissolution process. It resulted in there were different membrane
69
solution with 0.5 wt% water during 6 days. After deposing 1, 3 and 9 day, the falling
time could raise more than 50% for solutions with 2, 1.5 and 1 wt% of water. We
proposed that, at beginning every solution had similar macro-view performance, but
the water and time were the main factors to enlarge the differences between various
dissolution temperatures. With water and time increase, we suggested the solution
mobility would decrease quickly resulted from enhancing obviously in falling time.
Especially, for solution dissolved at 33 oC and mixed with 2 wt% water, it seems the
solution mobility could decrease suddenly.
Therefore, we suggested the solution mobility for solutions dissolved at 33 oC
would be restricted easily with time and absorbing water vapor, so polymer chain
couldn’t nuclear and grow easily when the composition passed the crystallization
region. By this way the crystallization couldn’t pre-domain the membrane
morphology, so the restricted polymer chain would be affected by liquid-liquid phase
separation and form non-spherular morphology with α and β types crystallites.

1. Introduction
Poly(vinylidene fluroride) (PVDF) becomes one of the attractive membrane
materials for the use in microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF)
regarding its outstanding properties, including excellent chemical resistance, good
thermal stability and mechanical properties [1-4]. However, serious biofouling
problem on the PVDF membrane surface usually limits its applications to biomedical
processes [5-7]. It is generally acknowledged that hydrophilic surfaces are more likely
to reduce the nonspecific adsorption of biomolecules, when living systems encounter
membrane surfaces. Therefore, an ideal antibiofouling membrane should possess the
excellent mechanical bulk properties of a hydrophobic material, such as PVDF, and
the antibiofouling characteristics of a hydrophilic surface on the membrane pores
and surface. The hydrophilic materials such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based
95
In the present work, surface-induced graft polymerization of PEGMA on PVDF
UF membrane surface were first carried out by ozone pre-treatment,
surface-coupling of 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide and followed by surface-initiated
ATRP, which grafting efficiency was compared to the previous study using
thermal-induced grafting copolymerization [16]. The grafting density of PEGMA
polymer brushes on PVDF membrane surface was controlled by different reaction
time with confined macromonomer concentration in the reaction solution at room
temperature. The chemical composition, hydrophilicity and morphology of the
PEGMA-modified ePTFE membrane surface were characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), water contact angle, and atomic force microscopy
(AFM). This work demonstrates the correlation between the degree of hydration and
protein adsorption on the virgin and PEGMA-grafted PVDF membrane surfaces.
Membrane biofouling properties on the prepared membranes were also evaluated by
the amounts of protein adsorption using the method of Bradford and the percentage
of protein fouling using ultrafiltration tests.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) macromonomer with a molecular
97
membrane was formed via phase inversion at 4oC. The formed UF membranes were
washed with deionized water for 24 h to completely remove the residual solvent and
pore-forming agent. A schematic illustration of surface-initiated copolymerization is
shown in Fig. 1. The prepared PVDF UF membrane of about 15.2 cm2 in surface area
was pretreated with a continuous stream of O3/O2 mixture. The O3/O2 mixture was
bubbled through 50 mL isopropanol (IPA) solution with a flow rate of 6 L/min for 30
min and ozone concentration of about 46 g/L at 25oC which was generated from a
custom-built ozone generator (Model OG-10PWA, Ray-E Creative Co., Ltd Taiwan).
After ozone treatment, the reactor flask was cooled quickly in an ice box at 4oC, and
purged by argon for 10 min, and keep in IPA before reaction. Then, two approaches
of surface-initiated copolymerization were used for the modification of the
ozone-treated PVDF membranes. For the thermally induced graft copolymerization,
the preparation of PVDF-g-PEGMA#1 membranes followed the process using a
method published previously [16].
For the surface-initiated ATRP, the ozone-treated PVDF membrane was placed
into a 50 mL distilled water at 80 oC for 2 hr and was then dried at room temperature
under a vacuum resulting in PVDF-OH. PVDF-OH membranes were immersed in 30
mL of BIBB solution (5 wt%) in IPA. After the slowly addition of 0.5 g triethylamine at
4 oC for 15 minutes, the system was reacted at room temperature for 18 h. PVDF
99
PEGMA on the PVDF membrane was determined by the extent of weight increase
compared to the virgin PVDF membrane. Prior to the weight measurements, the
membranes were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 50oC. Water contact angles
were measured with an angle-meter (Automatic Contact Angle Meter, Model CA-VP,
Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd Japan) at 25oC. The DI water was dropped on the
sample surface at 10 different sites. The surface morphology of virgin and these
surface-modified PVDF membranes and films were examined by atomic force
microscopy (AFM). All AFM images were acquired with a JPK Instruments AG
multimode NanoWizard (Germany). The instrument is equipped with a NanoWizard
scanner and operated in air. For tapping-mode AFM, a commercial Si cantilever
(TESP tip) of about 320 kHz resonant frequency from JPK was used. The relative
humidity was less than 40%.
2.4. Protein adsorption on the membranes
The adsorption of BSA (99%, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) onto the prepared
PVDF UF membranes was evaluated using the method of Bradford according to the
standard protocol of the Bio-Rad protein assay. The membrane with 1 cm2 of surface
area was rinsed with 20 mL of ethanol for 30 min and transferred into a clean test
tube, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL of PBS solution for 30 min. Then, the
membrane was soaked in 0.5 mL of 1 mg/mL BSA in 0.1 M PBS solution (PH 7.4) for
101
was measured at steady filtration for 60 min at 25oC. The average of measured
values using three independent membranes for the virgin and each modified
membrane was taken as its pure water flux. The degree of flux recovery ratio (RFR)
was then calculated by the following equation:

3. Results and Discussion
103
In order to improve of grafting efficiency of PEGMA polymer from PVDF
membrane surface, a new surface grafting approach was introduced using
surface-initiated ATRP. As shown in Fig. 1, the integrated process for surface-initiated
ATRP could be divided into three stages. The first stage was to produce hydroxyl
groups on the PVDF membrane surface (PVDF-OH) via ozone treatment and heating.
The amount of produced hydroxyl groups can be controlled by the ozone treating time.
It was found in Fig. 2 that the water flux and surface hydrophilicity of the PVDF
membrane increased as the ozone treating time increased from 0 to 10 min with the
controlled ozone concentration of about 46 g/L and heating temperature of 80oC in
distilled water for 2 hr. The phenomena is due to the fact that the amount of
hydroxyl groups on the PVDF membrane surface increased with the ozone treating
time increased. The second stage in the preparation process was subsequent to
coupling the initiator of bromide (Br) onto the PVDF-OH membrane surface (PVDF-Br)
via dehydration reaction. The following stage in the preparation process was finally to
copolymerize the macromonomer of PEGMA from the PVDF-Br membrane surface
via surface-initiated ATRP. The reaction conditions for the surface copolymerization
of the PVDF membranes are shown in Table 1. The virgin PVDF UF membrane was
obtained from the wet inversion process without any surface modification. The
membrane of PVDF-g-PEGMA#1 was prepared by surface-induced thermal
105
Fig. 4 shows the dependence of grafting density of the modified PVDF
membranes on the reaction time during the surface copolymerization for both
membranes of PVDF-g-PEGMA#1 and PVDF-g-PEGMA#2. The grafting density
(mg/cm2) of surface modified PVDF membrane is defined as the difference in weight
between the modified PVDF membrane and the virgin PVDF membrane divided by
the weight of the virgin PVDF membrane. It was found that when the reaction time
for surface copolymerization is increased, the grafting density of the copolymerized
PEGMA on the PVDF membrane increases from both preparation methods. After 3 hr
of the copolymerization time with PEGMA macromonomer content of 5 wt% in
reaction solution, the grafting density of the PVDF-g-PEGMA#1 membrane approach
their optimum values of about 0.05 mg/cm2 for almost complete grafted with PEGMA
macromonomer. However, the grafting density of the PVDF-g-PEGMA#2 membrane
increase above the value of 0.2 mg/cm2 via surface-initiated ATRP, indicating the
obvious increase in grafting efficiency of PEGMA polymer on PVDF membrane
surfaces compared to surface-induced thermal copolymerization. It also indicates a
practical insight that the surface modification via surface-initiated ATRP can be
performed at a reaction condition with small macromonomer content, short
copolymerization time, and room temperature.

3.3. Correlation of surface hydration capacity of the prepared PVDF membranes with
protein adsorption
The antibiofouling behavior of protein adsorption onto a surface with grafted
polymer chains has been extensively studied over the past two decades [20-24]. The
formation of the hydration layer on a hydrophilic surface was believed as a crucial
issue to repel proteins and made the protein conformations unchanged. In general,
grafting density, chain length, and chain conformation of grafted hydrophilic polymer
on the surface are the determining factors associated with the hydrated surface
capacity of water molecules. In this study, hydration capacity of the prepared
membrane was evaluated by the degree of hydration (%) which is defined as the
difference in wet weight between the PEGMA grafted PVDF membrane and the virgin
PVDF membrane divided by the wet weight of the virgin PVDF membrane. Fig. 6
showed the effect of grafting density control of PEGMA on the change of surface
contact angle and the degree of hydration of the modified membranes. In general, it
is usually observed that the surface hydrophilicity of PVDF membranes increase with
increasing grafting density of PEGMA on the surface of PVDF membranes. The water
contact angle of the PEGMA-grafted PVDF membrane surface was achieved as low as
about 60o, indicating an obvious increase in hydrophilicity compared to the virgin
109
evaluated by immersing the membranes in 1 mg/mL SA solution and the amount of
adsorbed protein was estimated by the method of Bradford. Fig. 7 showed the effect
of the degree of hydration of the modified membrane surface on the amount of BSA
adsorption. All of the protein adsorption amounts on the membranes were
correlated according to the standard calibration curve established using the UV
absorbance at 595 nm. It was found that reduction in nonspecific single protein
adsorption exhibited a linear correlation with the variation of the degree of hydration
on the modified PVDF membrane surface. The relative protein adsorption was
effectively reduced with increasing capacity of the hydration for the PEGMA chain
grafted on the membrane surface as shown in Fig. 6. The observed results confirmed
previous findings of low protein adsorption on the highly hydrated surfaces [16].
These results also strongly suggest that the hydrophilic surface of PEGMA-grafted
PVDF membranes could efficiently suppress protein adsorption and increase its
antibiofouling property.
3.4. Analysis of the ultrafiltration of BSA solution
The biofouling characteristics of the PEGMA grafted PVDF membrane was
evaluated by ultrafiltration tests. Fig. 8 showed typical results for the permeation
fluxes through three different membrane samples, including the virgin PVDF
membrane and two PVDF membranes grafted with PEGMA (PVDF-g-PEGMA#1 and
111
retention. The values of Rt decreased as the grafting density increased, indicating the
grafting of PEGMA polymer on the PVDF membrane surface exhibited an efficient
reduction of the total protein fouling. The total protein fouling was actually built up
by persistent protein adsorption and temporal protein blockage. The flux loss
because of temporal protein blockage was reversible and could be recovered by
membrane cleaning. Therefore, the reversible fouling ratio, Rr, was defined by the
percentage of pure water flux recovered in the third phase from its loss in the
second phase. The percentage of unrecoverable flux, which was resulted from the
fouling of persistent protein adsorption, was defined as the irreversible fouling ratio,
Rir. The water flux recovery ratio, RFR, defined as the ratio of pure water flux in the
third phase to that in the first phase, was exactly equal to 1 - Rir. The antifouling
capability of a membrane was usually monitored by the value of Rir or RFR. The higher
value of RFR indicated the lower persistent protein adsorption to the membrane
operated during the ultrafiltration process. The value of RFR was 55.5 % for the
untreated PVDF membrane, but it increased to 90.8% as the grafting density
increased approach 0.25 mg/cm2. The Rt value represented the overall effect of
fouling on flux loss. The loss is probably due to the contribution of both the loosely
attached and the firmly adsorbed proteins. It was observed that the Rt decreased
with the increase in PEGMA grafting density from 0 to 0.25 mg/cm2. The Rr value was
113
of the grafted PEGMA layer on the PVDF membrane surface were studied. Results
show that the protein fouling could be effectively reduced in highly hydrated
membrane surface by sufficient PEGMA grafting. Furthermore, results from protein
ultrafiltration tests showed that the prepared PVDF membranes with the grafting of
PEGMA polymer exhibited good antibiofouling properties, especially for the
irreversible membrane fouling caused by protein adsorption. The highly grafting
efficiency of PEGMA polymer on PVDF membrane surfaces by the suggested method,
surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization, could provide extremely low
protein adsorption and effectively reduce the irreversible membrane fouling.
