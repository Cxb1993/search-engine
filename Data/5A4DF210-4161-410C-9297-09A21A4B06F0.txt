2.Abstract
We investigates the electrical stress effects on the characteristics of a wide-band divide-by-3 injection
locked frequency divider (ILFD), which was fabricated in the 0.35 μm silicon–germanium (SiGe) 3P3M
BiCMOS technology. The active inductor ILFD has wide operation range and was performed by injecting a
differential signal to the bases of the injection HBTs. Changes in device characteristics due to accelerated
electrical stress are examined experimentally. The high forward-biased base-emitter stress leads to narrower
locking range and less sensitivity as stress time proceeds.
3.Introduction
SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) have numerous advantages over conventional silicon
bipolar transistors [1]. SiGe HBTs are suitable for large-volume manufacturing of RF transceiver systems and
the reliability has become a major concern for SiGe HBT advanced devices used in commercial products [1].
Many papers have discussed the stress effect on SiGe transistor parameters and the HBT RF circuit
degradation [1]–[4]. However, little is known about the HBT injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD)
circuit [5] degradation due to electrical stress. The ILFDs have wide application in frequency synthesizers and
transceivers.
We investigates the high-current induced degradation of RF performances in a SiGe ÷3 ILFD. Reliability
stress of bipolar transistors generally proceeds along two different paths [6]: (1) reverse emitter–base stress
and (2) high forward-current density stress. Both the stress methods result in current gain degradation. When
an HBT is used as an injection device as in the investigated ILFD, the base-emitter junction may be subjected
to high-current stress at high externally injection power. The experimental results of this work shows that the
high current stress results in current gain degradation and narrower locking range as stress time proceeds until
a saturation of degradation. The investigated ÷3 ILFD uses the HBTs as the tail injection devices because
HBT has higher gain than MOSFET for high frequency operation.
4. Circuit Design
The proposed SiGe HBT ÷3 ILFD with the tunable-active-inductor (TAI) is shown in Fig. 1. The TAI
consisted of transistors (Q1-Q4) and resistors (R1-R2) is used to emulate one differential TAI, which in
conjunction with the base-collector capacitor CBC and base-emitter capacitor CBE of Q9 (Q10) and other
parasitic capacitors forms the parallel LC resonator. The cross-coupled transistors (Q5-Q6) are used to generate
negative conductance to compensate for the loss from the resonator. The transistors (Q7-Q8) are used as
injection mixers, and they are dc-biased at the voltage Vinj. The tuning voltage Vtune is used to change the
base bias of Q1-Q4. When the circuit is used as an ILFD, a differential ac injection signal is applied to the
bases of Q7 and Q8. When no injection signal is applied to the bases of Q7 and Q8, the circuit is a free-running

GHz, is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 3 shows the measured relationship between input sensitivity and operating
frequency of the divide-by-3 frequency divider under the condition of Vtune = 2.5, 2.4, and 2.3 V, and Vinj =
2 V, VDD = 1.8 V, and Vswitch = 0.7 V with total operation locking range from 9.58 (7.74, 6.3) to 12.23
(11.13, 8.42) GHz at the injection power of 0 dBm. At Vtune = 2.3 V and Vswitch = 0.7 V, the locking range
is 1.64 GHz, from 9.49 to 11.13 GHz. Figure 4 shows the measured output spectra of the divider before and
after the locked conditions in the high-band ÷3 mode. The locked output spectrum shows lower phase noise.
Figure 5 shows the measured phase noises of the injection-reference and injection-locked ÷3 ILFD. At
1-MHz offset from the 3.84 GHz, when the external injection signal is injected, the phase noise of the locked
ILFD is about -131.74 dBc/Hz, while the phase noise of the injection-reference is -127.2 dBc/Hz. The
improvement of locked phase noise relative to the injection signal at low frequency offset is about 9.5 dB.
6. Measurement Results of Stressed ILFD
To examine the electrical effect on the SiGe HBT ILFD, the acceleration of ILFD circuit degradation was
carried out by two experiments. (1) The base-emitter junction of injection HBT is forward-biased at VBE = 6 V

sensitivity decreases at low injection power. In the second stress experiment, the injection HBTs operates at
high current density than that in the first experiment. When high forward-current density stress is applied to
the injection HBTs in the ILFD, current gain degradation is found and the injection efficiency of injection
HBT degrades and a small locking range is measured.
7. Conclusion
This paper has investigated the post-stress performance of a divide-by-3 active-inductor ILFD implemented
in the 0.35μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The experiment shows that only a forward base-junction bias stress
will not cause a dead performance of the ÷3 active-inductor ILFD, the stress causes the shift of locking range
depending upon the injection power. However the stress condition with high stressing damages the gain of
injection HBTs, which decreases the locking range versus stress time.
