Abstract 
Ultra wideband (UWB) impulse radio 
technology has recently spurred great interest 
for the applications in short range high-speed 
wireless multiple access system. Among the 
various modulation and multiple access 
schemes, this project deals with time-hopping 
(TH) antipodal pulse amplitude modulation 
(PAM) operating in the presence of multipath 
fading downlink channel. We develop two 
types of low-complexity mobile station (MS) 
receivers. One is based on the RAKE reception 
scheme and the other is designed to meet the 
minimum output energy (MOE) criterion. 
However, since accurate channel information is 
crucial for reliable operation, thereby we 
propose a subspace-based blind channel 
estimator. Simulation results show that the 
MOE receiver outperforms the RAKE receiver 
in multiuser environment. Moreover, both the 
channel estimation algorithm and the MOE 
reception schemes are shown to be near-far 
resistant. 
Keywords: Ultra wideband (UWB), Blind 
estimation, Time-hopping (TH), Multi-user

二、計畫緣由與目的 
Recently, considerable attention was paid to UWB IR 
systems due to its attractive features that include 
low-power carrierless modulation and ample multipath 
diversity.The basic structure of UWB radio stems from 
transmitting a stream of pulses of very short duration (on 
the order of nanosecond or less) and with very low duty 
cycle. When such transmissions are applied in multiple 
access system, the transmission model encompasses 
time-hopping (TH) pulse position modulation (PPM) 
[1-3], TH antipodal pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) 
[4], and direct sequence (DS) BPSK [5] schemes. In this 
project, we focus on the design of blind mobile station 
(MS) receiver in UWB IR multiple access 
communication system employing TH-PAM modulation 
scheme. In TH-PAM multiple access system, separation 
of different users is accomplished by assigning 
user-specific pattern of time shifting of pulses. In 
downlink TH-PAM UWB IR communication system, 
orthogonal TH codes can be chosen such that the pulses 
for each user are located in nonoverlapping time slots.
