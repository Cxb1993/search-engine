Abstract 
In this research, we consider the application 
of a new meta-heuristic algorithm, the 
Electromagnetism-like Mechanism (EM), to 
solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP). The 
VRP problem belongs to the combinatorial 
optimization problems. However, the problem is 
an NP-hard problem, and it is very difficult to 
solve. If we want to solve the VRP problem by 
traditional methods, we will either consume a lot 
of time and may not be cost-effective or unable 
to find the optimum (i.e. trapped into local 
minimum). The EM algorithm which was 
developed by Birbil and Fang (2003) is a 
meta-heuristic algorithm with an attraction- 
repulsion mechanism making solutions move 
toward the optimum. In the paper of Birbil et al. 
(2003), they have shown that the EM 
mechanism can avoid the sample points from 
trapping into the local optimum and moving 
toward the global optimum. In some literature, 
the EM algorithm is designed for solving 
real-valued problems. However, we draw the 
VRP problem as a sorting problem. Therefore, 
we try to modify the EM algorithm to suit the 
VRP problem. We anticipate that the EM 
algorithm could show its ability to find the 
near-optimal, even optimal, solutions efficiently.

二、緣由與目的 
The Electromagnetism-like Mechanism (EM) 
algorithm is a new meta-heuristic algorithm for 
global optimization [1]. There is no study that 
had ever tried to use this method to solve the 
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Therefore, we 
pay our interests to employ the EM algorithm to 
solve the VRP. However, the EM algorithm is 
designed to solve real-valued-solution problems. 
In order to fit the characteristics of the 
combinatorial optimization problems (i.e., 
4 
The attraction directs the points towards better 
regions, whereas repulsion allows particles to 
exploit the unvisited regions. 
 
General Scheme 
We apply the algorithm for the following global 
optimization problems with bounded variables: 
[ ] ,,..)(min ulxtsxf ∈               
(12) 
where [ ] ⎭⎬

⎩⎨
⎧ =≤≤ℜ∈= nkuxlxul kkkn …,1,:, , 
and the parameters are defined as: 
n: dimension of the problem; uk: upper bound 
in the kth dimension; lk: lower bound in the kth 
dimension; f (x): pointer to the function that is 
minimized.

8.   end while 
 
z Initialize 
The procedure “Initialize” generates m 
sample points (solutions) randomly from the 
feasible domain, which is an n dimensional 
hyper-cube. Each coordinate of a point (solution) 
is assumed to be uniformly distributed between 
the corresponding upper bound and lower bound. 
After a point (solution) is sampled from the 
space, the objective function value for the point 
(solution) is calculated using the function 
pointer f (x). The procedure ends with m points 
(solutions) identified, and the point (solution) 
that has the best function value is stored in xbest. 
The words particle and point are 
interchangeably used. 
z Local search 
The procedure “Local search” is used to 
gather the local information for a point xi. The 
procedure iterates as follows: First, it makes a 
length is calculated by the maximum difference 
of each dimension’s upper and lower bound. 
Here it makes use of the parameter δ ∈ [0, 1] to 
have a feasible random length (Length). Second, 
it make a temporary point (solution) y to store 
the initial point (solution) xi and let the point 
(solution) y move along the direction according 
to the feasible random length coordinate by 
coordinate. Next, if the point (solution) y 
observes a better point (solution) within the 
LSITER iterations, the point (solution) xi is 
replaced by y and the neighborhood search for 
point (solution) xi ends. Finally, the xbest is 
updated. 
z Total force calculation 
Cowan (1968) suggests that the force exerted 
on a point (solution) via other points (solutions) 
is inversely proportional to the distance between 
the points (solutions) and directly proportional 
to the product of their charges, so the total force 
on each particle is calculated in spirit of the 
Coulomb's Law. The charge of each point 
(solution), qi, determines point (solution) i’s 
power of attraction or repulsion. This charge is 
evaluated by

Where f (xi) is the objective function value of 
each point (solution) xi and the current best point 
(solution) xbest in the population has better 
objective function values f (xbest) resulting in 
higher charges. The parameter m represents the 
population size, n is the dimension of the 
solution space. Notice that, unlike electrical 
charge, no signs are attached to the charge of an 
individual point in equation (13). 
After calculating the charge of each point 
(solution), the total force Fi exerted on point

z Move along the total force 
After evaluating the total force Fi, the point 
(solution) is designed to move in the direction of 
the force by a random step length (15). Here two 
6 
1000 iterations. For each adaptation, we only 
iterate 100 times local search for the current best 
point (solution). We totally test a problem out of 
20 trials. 
Subsequently, those 3 benchmarks are tested 
by the prototype EM Algorithm and shown in 
Table 3. The column labeled “Best result” 
indicates the obtained best solution out of 20 
trials. The column labeled “Average” reports the 
average result of 20 trials. The “Optimal result” 
indicates the optimal result of the test problem. 
The “% Error” relates the deviation from the 
optimal result.

4.2 Results in the Improved EM Algorithm 
For the route improvement purpose, the 2-opt 
method is used in this study. Whereas the results 
in the prototype EM algorithm were not as good 
as expecting, we introduce the 2-opt method for 
the sake of hitting better solutions. The 2-opt 
method is a little more complicated. Two edges 
not adjacent to each other in a feasible route are 
exchanged for another two edges not in that 
solution as long as the result remains in the tour 
and the length of that tour is less than that of the 
previous tour. This exchanging procedure 
repeats until no feasible exchange that can 
improve the current solution can be found. Table 
4 shows results of this method.

4.3 Analysis and Discussion 
As the mention above, we have illustrated two 
types of the EM algorithm for solving the VRP. 
In the prototype EM algorithm, the original EM 
algorithm, the “%error” is too large to be 
satisfied. Then we add the 2-opt method to 
change routes sequence. By including the 2-opt 
method mechanism to the prototype EM 
algorithm, the improved EM algorithm is 
formed. In this way, the “%error” of each 
problem has been reduced, it displays that the 
performance of the second algorithm is better 
than the original EM algorithm.  
 
五、結論 
The EM algorithm is possible to solve the 
VRP. The improved EM algorithm, which we 
established are good for the original (prototype) 
EM algorithm.  
The parameters setting of the EM always 
influences the results and the time spending. It 
should be noticed that the important parameters 
which are the number of sample points, the 
maximum number of iterations, and the 
maximum number of local search iterations. 
There are many real world problems, e.g., the 
MDVRP, and VRPTW, have not been solved by 
this new meta-heuristic algorithm. In the future, 
we can apply this method for those problems. 
The second year’s project will focus on the 
above mentioned problems.

一、參加會議經過
本人很榮幸有這個機會能獲得國科會補助，有幸參與第二屆國際創新演算、資訊與
控制研討會(ICICIC 2007)，於會議期間參加及發表論文，獲益匪淺。本研討會是由 IJICIC
(International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control) 所舉辦的例行研
討會，IJICIC(國際創新演算、資訊與控制期刊)是一個國際電腦科學、控制與人工智慧
領域的期刊，研討會論文收錄於 IEEE Publisher (EI indexed)。
本人於 9 月 1 日由高雄出發前往日本關西機場，9 月 4 日抵達日本熊本大學報到，本
次會議共舉行三天，這三天當中，筆者親逢會場聆聽來自全球各地學者專家的論文發
表，並參加歡迎晚宴，次日上午(9 月 6 日)參加 B5 場次 Innovative Computing and Industrial
Applications 擔任議程主持人並親自報告。發表個人與學生的研究結果，『修正模擬電磁
演化法法於車輛路徑排程問題之研究』，其內容是在應用模擬電磁演算法+K-OPT 法於車
輛路徑排程問題，由於車輛路徑排程問題是 NP-Complete 的問題，一般最佳化演算法無
法有效解此類問題，甚至無法解大型的運算，因此一些啟發式演算法因應而生，其中禁
忌演算法、遺傳演算法、螞蟻演算法已經有許多學者進行研究，而模擬電磁演化法是一
個較新的啟發式演算法，尚未有許多學者用到類似的問題之中，經由此次的研討會的發
表，與許多與會學者專家交流意，以及對此研究的肯定，更有一些建設性的建言，使得
參加這次會議收穫不少。
