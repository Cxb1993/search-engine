Radial Basis Function Sliding-Mode Control for the Laser Alloying Process 
Hung-Yi Chen 
Abstract. Since the laser alloying process 
system has nonlinear coupling and time varying 
dynamic characteristics, it is very difficult to 
establish an accurate process model for 
designing model-based controller. Hence an 
adaptive radial basis function sliding-mode 
control is proposed by combining the advantages 
of the adaptive neural network and sliding-mode 
control strategies. It has on-line learning ability 
to deal with the system’s nonlinear and time-
varying uncertainties by adjusting the control 
parameters. Two adaptive radial basis function 
sliding-mode controllers are designed for tuning 
the laser power and the traverse velocity 
simultaneously to tackle the absorptivtiy and 
geometrical variations of the work pieces. The 
simulation results show that the good surface 
lapping performance is achieved by using this 
intelligent control strategy. 
 
Keywords: laser alloying, radial basis function,

1.1 Introduction 
It is well known that laser surface treatments 
have been widely used for improving the 
mechanical and chemical properties of metal 
parts. The results of laser alloy process are 
determined by the laser beam power density and 
beam velocity during the laser alloying process. 
Since the laser surface process has high 
sensitivity to the disturbance, the surface 
treatment results may have significant variation 
even under the same operation conditions. The 
desired temperature cycle and temperature 
distribution of the work piece may be perturbed 
by the process disturbance, which may induce 
the unacceptable quality results.  
Some of the process parameters such as the 
laser beam velocity and the laser power are 
observable and controllable, but some of them 
such as the focus and dynamic positioning error 
and melt pool depth can not be monitored. The 
major process disturbances in laser alloying 
process are absorptivity variation and work piece 
geometrical change [1]. Hence, it is necessary to 
design a good feedback control system to 
achieve reproducible results with constant 
alloyed surface properties. Romer et al. [2] 
chose the laser power as a command signal to 
suppress the effects of the absorptivity 
disturbance, and regulated the traverse velocity 
to compensate for the negative effect of 
geometrical disturbance. They employed PID 
and LQG controllers to control this multi-input 
and multi-output system based on an identified 
deviation model. Good control performance was 
obtained by using two PID controllers with 
mode-switching characteristic for laser power 
and beam velocity, respectively. Therefore, it is 
still a single-input and single-output control 
strategy as each time only one controller was 
activated by model-switching. 
Since the dynamic characteristic of this 
surface alloying process is very complicated, it 
is difficult to establish an appropriate dynamic 
model for a model-based controller design. 
Hence, a model-free control strategy is 
employed to solve this problem. Shieh et al. [3] 
employed a fuzzy logic control method to 
develop two fuzzy controllers for regulating the 
laser power and the traverse speed 
simultaneously to achieve the desired 
temperature distribution on the alloying surface. 
However, the design of a traditional fuzzy 
controller fully depends on an expert, or the 
experience of an operator. A time consuming 
adjusting process is required to achieve the 
specified control performance. Here, an adaptive 
radial basis function (RBF) sliding-mode 
controller is developed to tackle the variation 
and disturbance of this laser alloying control 
system. The proposed control strategy is based 
on a RBF structure combined with sliding-mode 
control scheme. An adaptive rule is employed to 
on-line adjust the weights of RBF by using the 
reaching condition of a specified sliding surface. 
Two adaptive RBF sliding-mode controllers are 
designed for regulating the laser power control 
and traverse speed simultaneously to achieve the 
desired temperature distribution on the alloying 
surface. The control performance is evaluated 
based on numerical simulation results. For

where s  is the sliding variable, e  is the tracking 
error and λ  is a strictly positive constant. This 
sliding variable, s , will be used as the input 
signal for establishing a NN model to calculate 
the control law. Recently, the RBFNN  [4,5] has 
been widely used to model and approximate 
non-linear functions. Here a RBFNN is 
employed to model the relationship between the 
sliding surface variable, s , and the system 
control law, u . The Gaussian function is used as 
the activation function of each neuron in the 
hidden layer. The excitation values of these 
Gaussian functions are distances between the 
input values of sliding variables, s , and the 
central positions of Gaussian functions. 
Here, a RBFNN-based controller is 
proposed by combining an adaptive rule and the 
technique of sliding-mode control. The control 
input of the RBFNN control is

where  is the number of hidden layer neurons,

surface variable,

introduced to adjust the weightings between 
hidden and output layers neurons. 
Based on the Lyapunov theorem, the 
sliding surface reaching condition is 0<ss& . If a 
control input u  can be chosen to satisfy this 
reaching condition, the control system will 
converge to the origin of the phase plane. Since 
a RBFNN is employed to approximate the non-
linear mapping between the sliding input 
variable and the control law, the weightings of 
the RBFNN should be regulated based on the 
reaching condition, . The adaptive rule is 
derived from the steep descent rule to minimize

the most important parameters in this control 
scheme which determine the ratio of each radial 
basis function in the control law. The control

1.5 Conclusion 
The laser surface alloying process has nonlinear 
coupling and time varying behavior. It is 
difficult to design a model-based controller for 
this control system. An adaptive RBF sliding-
mode controller was employed to form a closed 
loop control for this laser surface alloying 
process. Both simulation cases had shown that 
the proposed RBF sliding-mode control strategy 
can compensate the practical operation 
disturbances of the laser surface alloying process 
and monitor the laser alloying process 
successfully and effectively.
