二、英文摘要 
The interesting temperature-dependent 
characteristics of an In0.5Al0.5As/In0.5Ga0.5As 
metamorphic high electron mobility transistor 
(MHEMT) using the non-annealed and 
Ohmic-recess (NAOR) technique to reduced 
parasitic resistance are comprehensively 
studied and demonstrated. The proposed 
NAOR technique could reduce the parasitic 
resistance caused by large conduction band 
discontinuity at InAlAs/InGaAs interface. 
Therefore, the improvement of device 
performance in terms of DC and parasitic 
resistance as well as RF characteristics can be 
expected. In particular, as compared with the 
traditional MHEMT device, the higher 
gate/drain breakdown voltage of 22.93 (16.89) 
V, lower gate leakage current of 0.83 (259) 
μA/mm at VGD = -14V, higher drain saturation 
current 327 (299) mA/mm, higher maximum 
transconductance 302.4 (269.6) mS/mm and 
lower parasitic resistance 1.67 (2.02 Ω·mm) are 
obtained, respectively, for the studied NAOR 
device at 300 (500) K. The corresponding unity 
current gain cutoff frequency fT (maximum 
oscillation frequency fmax) are 21.4 (65.5) and 
19.3 (55.5) GHz at 250 and 400 K, respectively. 
Moreover, the relatively lower variations of 
device performance over wide temperature 
range (300 ~500 K) are obtained. 
 
三、計劃緣由與目的 
Recently, metamorphic high electron 
mobility transistors (MHEMTs) have attracted 
 3
etching process, the Ohmic contacts were 
formed into the channel layer by evaporated 
Ti/AuGe/Au metals. By using the OR 
process,11 the NA Ohmic contacts of the 
studied device could be achieved. Gate recess 
etching of cap layer was done by highly 
selective PH-adjusted solution.5 Gate Schottky 
contact was achieved by evaporating Ti/Au on 
the Schottky barrier layer. Finally, the 
air-bridge gate structure was developed.12 The 
air-bridge gate structure included multiple piers 
between gate pad and active region.12 The 
inserted titanium (Ti), used in both the gate 
metal and NAOR metal structure, was served 
as a barrier to avoid the out-diffusion of gold 
(Au). Furthermore, the inserted Ti metals had a 
good adhesion between the semiconductor and 
metal layers.13 For comparison, a traditional 
device, denoted as device B, was fabricated by 
the same process only without the NAOR 
technique. The schematic illustrations of the 
studied InAlAs/InGaAs MHEMTs with NAOR 
technique and traditional structure are depicted 
in Figure 1. The gate dimension of 1×100 μm2 
was used in this work. 
 
五、實驗結果與討論 
Figure 2 illustrates the measured 
gate-drain current-voltage (I-V) characteristics 
for the device A(NAOR) at different 
temperature. The inset shows the gate-drain 
breakdown voltage (BVGD) and reverse gate 
leakage current (IG) as a function of 
temperature of the studied device A and B. The 
source terminal is floating. The BVGD values, 
define at IG = -0.5 mA/mm, is decreased from 
22.93 (20.88) to 16.89 (14.46) V for device A 
(B) once the temperature is increased from 300 
to 500 K. Whereas, the corresponding IG are 
increased from 0.83 (1.02) to 259 (388) 
μA/mm, respectively. The variations of BVGD 
( BV△ GD) and IG ( I△ G) from 300 to 500 K are 
6.04 (6.42) V and 258.2 (386.9) μA for device 
A (B), respectively. The calculated degradation 
rate in BVGD (∂BVGD/∂T) and IG (∂IG/∂T) of 
device A (B) are -30.42 (-31.48) mV/K and 
1.32 (1.93) μA/mm·K, respectively. It should 
be noted that the undesirable lateral diffusion of 
Ohmic metal within n+ regions was caused by 
alloying and/or the thermal treatment. This 
leads to the large field near the drain terminal 
as well as poor breakdown voltage at gate-drain 
terminal.14-15 The undesired lateral diffusion 
could be effectively suppressed because of the 
use of NAOR technique. Therefore, it is also 
found that the temperature degradation rates in 
BVGD and IG are relatively insignificant for 
device A(NAOR). This demonstrates the 
importance of reducing the electric field at the 
drain side.15 Moreover, within the temperature 
range of 300 ~ 500K, the thermal-stable 
Schottky characteristics of devices with Ti/Au 
gate metal have been achieved. 
The drain saturation current (IDS) as a 
function of temperature, under different 
gate-source (VGS), are shown in Fig. 3. The 
typical common source I-V characteristics of 
the studied device A(NAOR) measured at 
various temperatures are also demonstrated in 
the inset. The applied gate-source voltage is 
VGS = -0.5 V/step. It should be noted that the 
kink effect or other degenerative behaviors 
caused by the impact ionization are not 
observed in the studied device A among the 
temperature of 300 ~ 500K. Since the wide-gap 
and high-resistivity undoped InAlAs Schottky 
and buffer layer can significantly suppress the 
leakage current, good pinch-off and saturation 
characteristics are achieved in the studied 
device A. In particular, the IDS values of device 
A (B), measured at VGS = +0.5 V, are as high 
327 (276) and 299 (248) mA/mm at 300 and 
500 K, respectively. At 300K, the IDS of device 
A(NAOR) is 18.4% higher than that of device 
B due to the reduced source and drain 
resistances. Owing to the utilize NAOR 
technique, the parasitic source and drain 
resistance of device A are remarkably reduced. 
The other minor effect may be caused by the 
suppression of holes (minority carrier) which 
inject from the drain metal into the channel.15-16 
 5
processes, the device A shows better linear 
properties and high gm with wide operating 
regime among the temperature of 300 ~ 500K. 
The corresponding maximum transconductance 
(gm,max), IDS, and IDS operating regime (>0.9 
gm,max) as a function of temperature are shown 
in Fig. 7. At VDS = 2.5 V, the gm,max values of 
device A (B) are 302.4 (261.2) and 269.6 
(214.9) mS/mm at 300 and 500K, respectively. 
The gm,max of device A is about 10.8% higher 
than that of device B at 300K. It is speculated 
that this increase in gm,max is due to the decrease 
of the Rp caused by NAOR technique. The 
available IDS,max values, at VDS = 2.5 V and VGS 
= +0.5 V, are 327 and 299 mA/mm, 
respectively. Experimentally, for device A, the 
gm,max and IDS,max values at 500 K still maintain 
89 % and 92 % of their values at 300 K. This is 
caused by the good Schottky behaviors and 
carrier confinement characteristics of the 
studied device A. The width of IDS operating 
regime is decreased from 158 (140) to 126 (125) 
mA/mm for device A (B) as the temperature is 
increased from 300 to 500K. Apparently, the 
IDS operating regimes of device A are larger 
than those of device B. Based on the low 
degradations of gm,max, IDS,max, and IDS-op with 
increasing the temperature, the studied device 
A(NAOR) is relatively temperature 
independent and suitable for high power 
applications. 
Figure 8 shows the dependences of unity 
current gain cut-off frequency (fT) and 
maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) on the 
IDS at different temperatures. The inset reveals 
fT and fmax as a function of temperature for 
device A and B. Under the bias condition of 
VGS = -0.1 (-0.1) V and VDS = 2.5 (2.5) V, the 
fT of device A (B) is decreased from 21.4 (17.5) 
to 19.3 (13.4) GHz as the temperature is 
increased from 250 to 400K. The 
corresponding fmax is decreased from 65.5 (58.0) 
to 55.5 (40.7) GHz. In addition, the studied 
device A (B) maintains 80% of its fT and fmax 
peak values over large IDS operating regimes of 
233 (131), 227 (128), and 220 (121) mA/mm at 
T=300, 350, and 400K, respectively. The 
degradation rate (
TI
I
DS
DS
∂
∂ 1 ) in IDS operating 
regimes (-5.52×10-4/K) of device A(NAOR) is 
relatively insignificant as the temperature is 
increased from 300 to 400K. Obviously, the 
device A(NAOR) exhibits better characteristics 
in fT and fmax at low temperature (250 K) and 
lower degradations of fT and fmax at high 
temperature (400 K). It is comprehensible that 
the higher gm and smaller Rp of device A are 
obtained due to the NAOR technique. 
Consequently, the NAOR device with 
high-frequency operating capability in 
microwave is achieved. 
 
六、結論 
In summary, the effect of non-annealed 
and Ohmic-recess (NAOR) technique on the 
temperature-dependent device characteristics of 
an interesting In0.5Al0.5As/In0.5Ga0.5As 
MHEMT are studied and demonstrated. 
Experimentally, it is found that the studied 
device A(NAOR) exhibits considerably 
enhanced device characteristics on the 
breakdown voltage, gate leakage current, drain 
saturation current, parasitic resistance, 
transconductance, and microwave performance. 
Moreover, the use NAOR technique shows 
benefits including simple device fabrication 
and absence of thermal treatment. Moreover, 
the device A(NAOR) exhibits the considerably 
lower temperature degradation in breakdown 
voltage (-30.42 mV/K), gate leakage current 
(1.32 μA/mm·K), threshold voltage (-1.21 
mV/K), parasitic resistance (1.53×10-3 
Ω·mm/K), and on-resistance (2.41×10-3 
Ω·mm/K) as the temperature is increased from 
300 to 500 K. In addition, for RF 
characteristics, the device A(NAOR) also show 
a low degradation rate on 
drain-saturature-current operating regimes 
(-5.52×10-4/K) as the temperature is increased 
from 300 to 400 K. These advantages provide
