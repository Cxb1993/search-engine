Abstract—A novel zero- voltage- transition (ZVT) bridgeless, three phase power factor correction circuit 
(PFC) was proposed, Twice units of auxiliary circuits were used to reduce the turn-on switching loss for the top 
and bottom main switches of the bridgeless PFC circuit. In additional, the auxiliary circuit has been placed at the 
ac side to reduce the conduction loss caused by its diodes of auxiliary circuit and achieve to bidirectional power 
flow. Soft commutation of the main switches is achieved without imposing additional voltage stress on the main 
switches. It is easy to drive for the bottom three main power MOSFET switches and the bottom auxiliary switch, 
lower power losses due to shorter resonant switching duration. Then, a detailed description of the operation of the 
proposed circuit will be given. Based on the analysis, guidelines for the component selection are presented. A 
prototype of 33kHz, 2kW, the bridgeless three-phase PFC circuit was built to verify the proposed scheme. Based 
on the same concept, a novel ZVT-ZCS three-phase PFC circuit with bidirectional power flow was proposed.

inverter have been undertaken to solve the diode reverse recovery problem. Zero voltage transition (ZVT) 
and zero current transition (ZCT) are the two most practical ones in the past decade. 
Several soft switching circuits have been reported [9]-[26] to solve the problems conventional three 
phase rectifiers/ inverters.  The simple topology is achieved by applying the soft-switching lank circuit 
at the dc side, as the resonant dc Link (RDCL) and the Active Clamped Resonant dc link (ACRDCL) 
converter[11]-[14]. Although the kind of the Resonant circuits the switching loss of main switches are 
significantly reduced, the conduction loss in the resonant circuit is high and the voltage stress of 
switches is high. And high frequency pulsating voltage is used in RDCL converters to synthesize the 
three phase voltage. This control technique requires the dc link resonating frequency to higher than the 
switching frequency and limits the converter performance. 
The ZVT topologies which improve the RDCL converters were reported. It provides zero voltage 
switching conditions without increasing the voltage and current stresses of the switches.  It is only 
active during a short period of a switching cycle and therefore does not affect the PWM control of the 
converter. However, a diode can be used as the dc-rail switch, it will cause the additional loss. 
In order to improve the additional loss which cause by the auxiliary circuit, the bidirectional power 
flow topology named the auxiliary resonant commutated pole ARCP converter [15]-[18] were reported. 
The auxiliary circuit is placed at the ac side to reduce the auxiliary circuit conduction loss.   
This paper presents a novel soft switching circuit for three phase power factor correction circuits. 
The circuit combines the conventional three-phase, six step PWM boost rectifier with a resonant lank 
circuit. The proposed topology is showed as Fig. 2. The additional circuit provides the function of zero 
voltage turn on for the six main switches and soft turn off for all the diodes.  In this paper, a description 
of the proposed circuit will be given in Section II. Design guidelines for the resonant tank circuit and 
experimental results will be presented in Section III and Section IV. Extension of the concept to other 
topologies will be given in Section V. Section VI concludes this paper.

Assume three-phase source is balance, and current and voltage in phase. It can be described by the 
equation (1) to (3) 
 
tVtv mR ⋅= ωsin)(

According to the three-phase voltage variety, one line-source period can be separated by six 
sections, in every 600 interval. For example, in the section 1 (vR > vT  > 0> vS), the current flows through 
diode DRp and DTp from top group to load , then back to source through DSn from bottom group. Fig. 4 
shows the conduct sequences of the diodes in three-phase rectifier.  
By KVL-KCL law, the equation 0=++ TSR III  can be gained. Therefore, both of three 
phase currents would be only controlled, then the other can be taken shape to achieve to power factor 
correction of three-phase current. In order to analysis the operation of this circuit, first section could be 
selected. Assume the converter is operating in Section 1 at an instance when vR , vT  > 0, and vS < 0. 
Using the PWM manner, the switches SRN and STN in the two phases are only controlled. The circuit 
operates like a conventional boost converter which operated at two states. One is that when the switches 
SRN and STN turn on, each of three phase inductances is charged by per phase current through the body 
diode DSN. The other is that when the switches SRN and STN turn off, the power flow of every phase

B. Operation of the proposed three-phase ZVT PFC circuit 
In three-phase converter, Fig. 1 is the most popular topology. It has many advantages such as easy 
to implement the active input current shaping, lower current distortion, high efficiency and small input 
EMI filter. When the main switches SRN, SSN, and STN in bottom side are operated in active, the body 
10 
 
period, phase S has the lowest voltage, so the switch SSN of the lowest phase current conducts 
continuously through the body diode DSN. In soft-switching circuit operation, the auxiliary switches are 
used to be active for a short time prior before main switch turn-on during every switching cycle. 
  In Fig. 2, CRp, CSp, CTp, CRn, CSn, and CTn are the capacitors in resonance with Lp  or Lnr 
during the switching transition periods. These six capacitors could be the parasitic output capacitors of 
the six main switches or in some cases could include externally-added capacitors. To simplify the 
waveform analysis, the input boost inductance is assumed large enough to be considered as an ideal dc 
current source and the output capacitance is assumed to be sufficiently large to be considered as an 
ideal dc voltage source Vo as shown by the equivalent circuit as Fig.8. 
Fig. 8 shows the operated stage of the proposed circuit and Fig. 9 shows the key waveforms of the 
proposed ZVS bridgeless three-phase PFC boost rectifier for the 9 detailed operation modes. The 
operation of the high-side leg is similar and is therefore omitted. 
Mode 0 : [ t0 - ] 
Prior to t0 all of the main switches and both of the auxiliary switches are off, but the body diode 
of SRn, SSn and STn are conducting. Current flow is released through the body diode of SRp and STp, to the 
load and returns through the body diode of SSn back to the input mains. This interval is identical to the 
freewheeling stage of the boost PWM converter. 
Mode 1 :[ t0 –t1] 
At t0, before the main switches SRn, SSn and STn, the auxiliary switch SNr is turned on. The resonant 
inductance current linearly ramps up until it reaches IS at t1, where DNr is turned off with 
zero-current-switching. The time interval t01 is given by

Mode 2 : [ t1 –t2] 
When the resonant inductance current ILNr is equal to IS, the mode 2 will be started. At this mode, 
the current ILNr continues to increase due to the resonance between LNr and Cr. Cr is discharged until the

To compare the performance of the proposed three-phase ZVT converter and conventional 
three-phase PFC converter, the same prototype hardware was used. Voltech PM3000 is used for 
efficiency measuring. Fig. 16 shows the measured efficiency curves for the proposed three-phase ZVT 
circuit and conventional three-phase PFC converter. The top curve applies to the proposed three-phase 
ZVT circuit. The bottom curve is for the hard-switching counterpart.  The efficiency improvement was 
evident, especially at the heavy load condition. It should be pointed out that no attempt was made to 
optimize the basic power circuit efficiency. The effort was to verify the circuit operation and show the 
improvement achievable.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
A novel soft-switching bridgeless, three-phase power factor correction circuit has been proposed 
and demonstrated by an experimental prototype which is set a ac-line input 380Vac, 33-kHz, 2k-W with 
significant efficiency improvement. Three-phase PFC operated model is been analysis and implemented 
which was obtained the good characteristic of total harmonic distortion and power factor. Using the 
auxiliary resonant circuit, all of the main switches are turned on with ZVS and boost diode is turned off 
softly. The proposed soft switching technique improves the efficiency by approximately 1% point at full 
load, compared to a hard switching counterpart. Besides, a novel ZVT-ZCS bridgeless PFC boost 
rectifier and a novel three-phase ZVT-ZCS bridgeless PFC circuit with bidirectional power flow have 
been proposed and demonstrated by a simulation.

Abstract –This paper presents an open-loop synchronized-off 
voltage mode (SFVM) control scheme for a two-phase 
interleaved boost converter with master-slave strategy for PFC 
applications. Interleaving CCM/DCM boundary mode boost 
converters, however, is complicated because of the variable-
frequencies nature of the operation. The problem of current 
divergence is often encountered in the Slave converter. In this 
paper, a novel on-time adjustment scheme of Slave converter is 
presented to stabilize the interleaved converter without using 
any phase-lock loop, multiplier or inductor current sensing. A 
circuit was proposed to verify the strategy by simulations. 
INTRODUCTION 
The interleaved CCM/DCM boundary mode boost 
converter becomes popular for power factor correction (PFC) 
applications. Recently, there have been papers published on 
this general topic [1]-[14]. The CCM/DCM boundary mode 
boost converter has no reverse recovery problem with power 
diode while maintaining moderate power transistor losses. It 
is operated with constant on-time variable frequency control. 
Interleaving of the two or more converters reduces the 
input/output capacitor requirements and achieves higher 
power output level with high efficiency. The combination of 
boundary mode and interleaving makes good sense for power 
level in multi-hundred watt ranges. 
However, the interleaved CCM/DCM boundary mode 
boost converter for PFC applications presents a complicated 
control issue because of the variable-frequency operation. In 
a constant-frequency converter, the interleaving can be done 
relatively easily by timing the Slave converter unit(s) 
switching at a fixed-phase shift with respect to the Master 
unit. A phase shift of 180 degrees is used for two-phase and 
120 degree for three-phase interleaving and so on. For 
variable-frequency operation, the coordination of Slave unit 
to the Master unit becomes problematic that may lead to 
current divergence problem in the Slave unit. There are four 
possible combinations of coordinating the Slave unit with the 
master unit [9], which are synchronized-off current mode, 
synchronized-on current mode, synchronized-off voltage 
mode and synchronized-on voltage mode. With the exception 
of synchronized-on current-mode scheme (SNCM) [5], [6], 
none of the four schemes afore-mentioned can achieve phase 
current balance without a current control loop. However, to 
implement an open-loop SNCM scheme requires the use of a 
multiplier and inductor current sensing which adds cost. The 
synchronized-off voltage mode scheme (SFVM) can be 
implemented without using either component [7], [12] but 
current divergence phenomenon occurs when the transistor 
duty cycle is less than fifty percent [9]. This problem can be 
resolved in close-loop control by using a phase-lock loop 
(PLL) [1]-[4]. PLL adds complexity, cost and reduces the 
control bandwidth nevertheless.  
In this paper, a novel control strategy was proposed for 
interleaving CCM/DCM boundary mode boost converters for 
PFC applications without using any PLL loop, multiplier and 
current sensor. In the paper, a rigorous analysis of the current 
divergence problem of open-loop SFVM scheme will be 
given first from which a novel method will then be proposed. 
A circuit to implement the strategy will be described. Results 
of circuit simulations will be conducted to verify the strategy. 
ANALYSIS OF CURRENT DIVERGENCE PROBLEM IN 
CONVENTIONAL SFVM INTERLEAVED BOOST CONVERTERS 
Fig. 1-(a) shows the circuit diagram of a conventional 
open-loop SFVM interleaved boost converter and 1-(b) 
shows the waveforms when the transistor duty cycle of the 
Master unit is less than 50%. There is a “Master” converter 
and a “Slave” converter. The instant of Master switch turn-on 
is determined by the zero-current-detector mZCD  of the unit. 
And the comparison of ramp waveform _ref mS  and voltage 
feedback command compV  determines the switch turn-off 
instant of Master unit. The instant of Slave switch turn-on is 
determined by the zero-current-detector sZCD  of the unit. 
The instant of turn-off of the Slave unit is determined by the 
synchronized-off signal offSyn  which is coordinated with 
the turn-off signal of the Master unit, i.e., it was delayed by 
one ripple-frequency cycle or one half of the switching cycle 
of the previous period , 1 2s mT −  respect to the Master unit. 
As shown in Fig. 1-(b), the on-time of the Master unit is a 
constant but that of the Slave unit varies as shown by the

 A PROPOSED CONTROL STRATEGY FOR INTERLEAVED SFVM 
CONVERTERS 
Fig. 3 shows the converter key waveforms using the 
proposed SFVM control scheme. The major difference 
between the proposed and the conventional method lies in the 
control of turn-off instant of the Slave unit. This will be 
explained below. Referring to Fig. 3, a rising ramp Sref_s 
signal with a slope of m1 is formed during the transistor turn-
on period of the Slave unit. m2 is the slope associated with 
Sref_s  as indicated in the figure. Another signal, (Vcomp+Sr), 
which is the output of the voltage loop compensator Vcomp 
signal superposing on an external declining ramp Sr with a 
slope of m3.  The comparison of the two signals determines 
the signal Ssc, which is then compared with Synoff through a 
logic “OR” gate, by whichever signal comes first, to 
determine the turn-off instant of the Slave unit. As can be 
seen from the waveform of Slave inductor current in Fig. 3, 
this scheme reduces the excessive on-time of Slave unit and 
therefore avoids current divergence. The magnitude of the 
slope m3 is dictated by the line voltage and, therefore, 
modifies the on time as the line voltage is increased. If a 
proper m3 value is used, the current divergence problem of 
the Slave unit mentioned above can be avoided. Derivation of 
the criterion for avoiding current-divergence problem will be 
described in the following sections.

        (4) 
It can be seen from (4) that, the phase error on the Slave 
unit is caused by not only the external perturbation [8],        
[9], but also internal tolerance of Synoff due to variable 
switching periods. In a PFC application, the line input voltage 
varies with time so that the turn-off instant of the Slave unit is 
based on the off-time of the previous period and it’s difficult 
to keep 180-degree shift with respect to the Master unit. From 
the waveforms in Fig. 1-(b), the turn-on instant of Slave unit 
in the (m+1)th period is obtained as

slope m1 is greater than the slope 2m .

From (9), it can be seen that the criterion to avoid current

right-hand side of (9) is larger than unity, a sufficient 
condition for current divergence is then expressed by (11). As 
shown in Fig. 4-(a), this makes the error diminish as the cycle 
moves on and eventually disappears, i.e., current converges.

 SIMULATION RESULTS 
Simulations were conducted to verify the validity of the 
proposed scheme. SIMPLIS circuit simulation tool was used. 
The parameter values and the converter working conditions 
are summarized as follow. Vo = 400V, LA=LB=200uH, 
Co=470μF. Following the design indicated in (15), the 
coefficients of the analog control circuit can be set as 
Iref=10mA, Is=1mA, Cx=Cs=10nF, and the parameters of the 
PFC voltage controller are R1=9.7Kohm, R2=1.5Mohm, 
R3=180Kohm, C1=47nF and C2=47uF, which give dc gain of 
2.2 and the zero and pole, receptively, at 18.8Hz and 
0.019Hz. Fig. 6 shows the simulated inductor current 
waveforms which have no current divergent problem even 
when the duty cycle is less than 50%. To verify the stability, 
the time-domain estimation is used to analyze the system 
stability. When the two inductance values are not matched, 
the currents are unbalanced as expected but the Slave current 
never diverges as shown in Fig. 6-(b). Fig. 7 shows the 
waveforms responses for a step-line change and Fig. 8 shows 
similar waveforms for a step-load change. In both cases, the 
circuit performs well and the power factor seems good 
judging from the waveforms of the input current.

CONCLUSIONS 
Synchronized-off voltage-mode open-loop control 
scheme for interleaving boost converters for PFC applications 
was investigated with regard to phase current divergence 
problem in the slave converter. From the investigation, a new 
control strategy was proposed to resolve this problem while 
retaining the inherent nice features of the control scheme.  A 
circuit to implement the strategy was proposed which 
requires no current feedback loop, no multiplier and no 
current sensing. Circuit simulation results verify the proposed 
scheme. A hardware circuit will be built to verify the 
proposed scheme in the future.
