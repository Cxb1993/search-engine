1. Introduction 
In the membrane technique, gas separation was considered a very important role for 
purification process. The phase inversion method is put a major way for membrane preparation in 
gas separation. The solvent types and physical properties of the casting solvent were complicated. 
Hence, it was believed that the polymer membrane would be affected by choosing different 
casting solvent. Bi et al.[1-2] prepared the membranes cast by various solvents and measured the 
values of τ4、I4 from PALS and the d-space to realize the free volume of membrane. It was 
showed that the casting solvent had huge influence on the free volume morphology and gas 
transport behavior. Hu et al. [3] used various solvents to cast different PMMA 
membranes .Results showed that the gas permeability coefficient was changed due to the free 
volume difference caused by casting solvent characteristics. Shao et al. [4] also pointed out that 
the crystal structure of polymeric membrane would be affected obviously by different casting 
solvent. In the phase inversion method, high temperature thermal treatment in vacuum was used 
to release the casting solvent in the membrane. However, it could not be confirmed that all the 
solvent evaporated during this thermal process completely. As a result, it was considered that 
there might be some influence donated from the residual solvent while the membrane 
characteristics and gas transport phenomena were discussed. Moe et al. [5] discussed the effect of 
different residual solvent quantity on the membrane. It was found that the polymer chains 
mobility and plasticization would be controlled by the amount of the residual solvent. Brown et 
al. [6] studied the influence of membrane proceed different thermal treatment on the gas 
permeability and selectivity. It was reported that the performance of membrane was affected by 
the extent of residual solvent removing and treatment temperature. Sakaguchi et al. [7] studied 
the effect of solvent attracted by thermal treatment on gas separation. It was revealed that the gas 
permeability had tendency toward been improved as increasing the thermal treatment 
temperature while the selectivity was reduced. Joly et al. [8] investigated the residual solvent 
effect on the 6FDA-mPDA polyimide membrane cast from various casting solvents. The surface 
roughness, glass transition temperature, gas transport performance were discussed. Addition to 
the results, the residual solvent effect on the membrane properties and gas separation 
characteristics were exhibited obviously. It was considered that the permeation properties of 
6FDA-mPDA polyimide membrane were affected by the residual solvent but not influenced by 
the quality of casting solvent resulted from the reorganization during the curing [9]. Moreover, it 
was still disputed that what is known as the solvent effect could simply be a result of the presence 
of residual solvent in the polymeric films. This is because the complete removal of residual 
solvent can only be ensured by annealing the polymer above its glass transition temperature [10]. 
Hence, it still has some difficulty to control the amount of the residual solvent and discuss its 
effect in practice. In present day, high performance computer and PC cluster have been 
developed rapidly. It has many studies which use the molecular simulation by computer 
calculation to replace the conventional experiments. In the qualitative analysis or quantitative 
analysis for material properties, the computer simulation technique also got well results and good

method of PI membrane model were described below. 
2.1 Construction of 6FDA-mPDA PI membrane models 
In this study, five kinds of solvent were chosen to construct the membrane. Those are 
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N-N-Dimethyl acetamide (DMA), Dioxane (DIO), 
Tetrahydrofurane (THF) and Dichloromethane (DIC), respectively, from higher boiling point to 
the lower. The amount of weight loss in membrane was measured by TGA analysis (Joly et al.) 
[8]. Weight loss in the membrane was considered the residual solvent releasing from the 
membrane because of no any chemical reaction occurred during the thermal treatment. Hence, 
the different solvent quantity remained in the membrane could be decided by the different 
thermal treatment time, 2880 min and 90 min, respectively. According to the thermal treatment 
time and selected solvent, the membrane model we built in this study were named PI_90_NMP, 
PI_90_DMA, PI_90_DIO, PI_90_THF, PI_90_DIC, PI_2880_NMP, PI_2880_DMA, 
PI_2880_DIO, PI_2880_THF and PI_2880_DIC, respectively.  
Table 1 shows the membrane weight loss and constructional parameters where the weight loss 
got from Joly et al. [8]. By getting the quantity of residual solvent, the membrane models 
contained different residual solvent were built. There are three stages for the model building. 
First, five kinds of PI solution models contained 6FDA-mPDA polyimide chains and various 
solvents were built through the energy minimization for 1000 times by using the COMPASS 
force-field to obtain the stable structures. All the densities of PI membranes under the long time 
thermal treatment are 1.45 g/cm3 from the experimental data [8]. As a result, the densities of 
solvent free PI membranes were set 1.45 g/cm3. Meanwhile, the densities of PI solutions 
were obtained by calculation with the quantity of selected solvents with their densities. 
The polymer monomer and solvent structure were shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The building 
parameters of solution were list in Table 1. The physical properties of solvents and solution were 
illustrated in Table 2. The next step is the solvent evaporating stage. The solvent molecules were 
chosen randomly and then removed in three times to imitate the real states like the evaporation 
process. Moreover, the energy minimization was carried out after solvent removed from those PI 
solutions. It was supposed that the solvent evaporated from the membranes rapidly during the 
process. Finally, the numbers of solvent molecules in the PI solution were decided by the 
experimental data and the energy minimization was also done to get the ultimate stable 
membrane models. The 50 ps MD calculation was performed under the NVT (T=308K) 
ensemble condition to make the matrix equilibrated. Then, the NVT (T=308K) ensemble 
condition of MD simulation for 1 ns duration was carried out to analyze the membrane structure, 
polymer properties and the gas diffusion mechanism, where the time step is 1 fs. Later, the gas 
sorption behavior was discussed by MC simulation.

where the VW was got by using the Van der Waals surface instead of using the Bondi’s groups. 
The accessible volume and fractional accessible volume (FAV) were got by using the hard 
spherical particle to probe the volume which was allowed to pass through. But the 
inter-molecular interaction (Van der Waals and Coulumbic force) of the spherical particle was not 
inserted here. The free volume morphology was also discussed by analyzing the cross-section of 
the cubic membrane model in x, y and z directions. The cross-section was treated to the graph 
composed by 256×256 pixels. The areas occupied by the free volume in the cross-section was 
calculated and transformed to the equivalent diameters. Then, the free volume size distribution 
was obtained by counting the free volume equivalent diameters. 
The sorption and diffusion mechanisms 
The sorption behaviors between the gaseous molecules and membrane included (1) adsorbing 
on the membrane surface (2) the adsorbate reacted or exchanged the sorption position on the 
membrane surface or (3) the adsorbate desorbed from the membrane surface. In order to calculate 
and illustrate the three sorption mechanisms correctly, the Monte Carlo simulation was applied. 
In this study, the sorption interface simulation utilized the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo method 
(GCMC), and the gas concentration probability could be determined by the energy change 
calculation between the new configuration and the previous one. In the procedure, the Metropolis 
algorithm was utilized to accept or reject the configurational moving of sorbate molecules. There 
were four kinds of probabilities of configurational moving included configuration creation, 
configuration rotation, configuration translation and configuration destruction, respectively. The 
creation and destruction probabilities of sorbate molecules movement could be expressed as 
( 1)min 1;exp ln i

where the ΔE is the energy change between the new configuration and the previous one, k is 
the Boltzmann’s constant, T is the assigned simulation temperature, Ni is the numbers of 
component i in the configuration, f is the fugacity of component i, and V is the cell volume. The 
probability of translation movement in membrane cell was given as

(5) 
The sorbate molecule was chosen randomly, and the amount of translation was given randomly. 
For the probability of rotation movement, the sorbate molecules and rotation axis and the amount 
of rotation were also chosen randomly. The new gaseous configuration, based on the energy 
change, was obtained with the same probability applied to the translation movement as 
mentioned above. 
The calculation of the four kinds of probabilities mentioned above for one time was considered 
a completed Monte Carlo calculation step. The total number of sorption analysis calculation in 
 10
distribution analysis, there was above 90% free volume in the range between 0 to 2 Å. It was 
revealed that the 6FDA-mPDA PI membrane belonged to the dense membrane for gas separation. 
Hence, the relative large and continuous free volume in such membrane would put great 
influence for gas transport behaviors. Fig. 5 indicates that the PI_90 membrane had more 
percentage of free volume between 0～1 Å. It means that the PI_90 membrane contained more 
dense free volume. In the other hand, the free volume of PI_2880 membrane had more 
percentage between 3～6 Å. Hence, it figures that the PI_2880 membrane might contain more 
effective free volume for N2 and O2 transport. Therefore, it could be considered that the residual 
solvent had apparent influence on free volume distribution. Table 1 lists the difference of free 
volume size in the range between 3～6 Å among different membranes. Those differences has 
same tendency (PI_ DIO > PI_DMA > PI_ NMP > PI_THF > PI_DIC) with the difference of the 
residual solvent in the membrane. Meanwhile, the free volume size distribution was also 
compared with the gas solubility from the experimental data [8].Those PI membranes would have 
higher differences of gas solubility coefficient while their differences of effective free volume 
were larger such as PI_DIO and PI_DMA. As a result, it was indicated that the increasing of 
effective free volume was benefited to the sorption phenomenon after gas entering the membrane. 
However, the gaseous molecules had lower diffusion ability in PI_2880 membranes which 
contained more effective free volume from the experimental data of gas diffusion coefficient [8]. 
It exhibits that the gas transport in the membrane would still be affected by the other important 
factors besides membrane free volume distribution. Hence, the gas sorption behavior and 
diffusion mechanism were studied in order to investigate the residual solvent effect. 
3.2 Residual Solvent on Gas Sorption Behavior  
The gas transport in the polymeric membrane could be described as sorption and diffusion 
behavior by the solution-diffusion model. The residual solvent effect on the gas sorption behavior 
was discussed and compared with the free volume distribution. Later, the gas diffusion 
mechanism was also studied to realize the influence of residual solvent in the gas permeation. 
Residual Solvent Effect on the Loading Gas Sorption 
Fig. 6 (a) illustrates the effect of residual solvent quantity on the loadings of N2 sorption in the 
PI membranes. It was shown that the PI_2880 membranes had obvious high solubility than PI_90 
membranes. The reasons could be explain as following statement: The partial free spaces in the 
membrane would be released by the solvent evaporation processes. Meanwhile, those free spaces 
in the membranes were benefit to the gas entering into the membranes and finding the free 
sorption sites. Moreover, the competition effect in sorption between gas and solvent molecules 
would be reduced while the solvent quantity was decreased. Hence, the decreasing of residual 
solvent in the membrane might improve the gas solubility coefficient. In addition, there was same 
result in the case of calculating the CO2 solubility coefficient as Fig. 6 (b) shows. However, the 
effect of residual solvent on CO2 sorption in PI_90_DIC was opposite to the other case. The 
solubility coefficient was not increased but decreased while the residual solvent quantity was 
 12
pressures. It was found that the solubility coefficient was decreased obviously while the 
operation pressure was improved. The N2 solubility decreasing might be caused by the saturated 
sorption sites in the higher pressure which could not provide enough space for gas sorption. Table 
5 (a) and Table 5 (b) list the difference of N2 and CO2 solubility between PI membranes with 
various residual solvent quantities in different pressures. It was revealed that the residual solvent 
effect in gas solubility under higher pressure was reduced. The reasons for the solubility 
difference decreasing could be illustrated as following explanations: The sorption sites for 
gaseous molecules might be occupied by the solvent molecules which resulted to the decreasing 
of the gas solubility. Meanwhile, the gaseous competition effect would also be improved due to 
the much more loading for sorption in the higher pressure. Thus, the saturated sorption sites 
would be formed by the sorption behavior of gas and solvent molecules. Hence, the influence of 
residual solvent would also be reduced relatively due to the effect of gaseous competition on 
sorption. Furthermore, there was same result of the CO2 sorption isotherm for the discussion of 
residual solvent effect as the case of N2. 
3.3 Residual Solvent on Gas Diffusion Probability 
The gas diffusion behavior in polymeric membrane was mainly caused by gaseous thermal 
motion. Those thermal motion could be classified as jumping, trapped and diffusive where the 
jumping and diffusive were considered as the effective thermal motion for diffusion mechanism. 
Therefore, the effective thermal motions of N2 and CO2 in the PI membrane with various residual 
solvent quantities were analyzed in this study to discuss the diffusion mechanism. Table 6 lists 
the thermal motion of gaseous N2 molecules in the five kinds of PI membranes. It was shown that 
the effective thermal motion of N2 molecules was reduced while the membrane had lower 
quantity of residual solvent. It indicates that the fluctuation of molecules in the membrane would 
be promoted as the membrane contained more solvent molecules. However, the improvement of 
the thermal motion was not obvious due to the free spaces in the membranes occupied by the 
solvent molecules. Meanwhile, those solvent molecules remained in the membrane would also 
cause the barrier for gas movement. By the analysis of gas transport behavior, it was found that 
the residual solvent effect mainly affected the gas sorption phenomenon but not the gas diffusion 
mechanism.  
4. Conclusion 
The effect of residual solvent on free volume and gas transport phenomena of 6FDA-mPDA 
PI were analyzed through the MD and MC technique. By analyzing the free volume distribution, 
it was showed that the effective FFV would be improved while the residual solvent was 
decreased in the matrix. The gas sorption ability was strongly affected by the effective free 
volume due to the change of the amount residual solvent. The inter-molecular interaction would 
be the key point for gas sorption if there was not obviously free volume difference. The residual 
solvent effect was reduced due to the saturated sorption site under the relative high pressure. In 
the case of thermal motion analysis, it was revealed that the inter-molecular interaction was
