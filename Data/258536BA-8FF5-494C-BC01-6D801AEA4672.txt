ABSTRACT 
  Fire extinguishers are the first line of fire-fighting apparatus when fires occur. But 
if a fire extinguisher has sat idle for a long time, which would cause the extinguishing 
agent to damp, it cannot achieve the desired effect and be properly handled in the first 
time of the accident, possibly causing more casualties and property losses. 
1,1,-di-(tert-butylperoxy)-cyclohexane (DTBPC) 70 mass% and 
1,1,-di-tert-butylperoxy-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane (TMCH) 88 mass% were 
employed to mixed with monoammonium phosphate (MAP) for understanding the 
exothermic and endothermic phenomenon by applying differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) in non-isothermal conditions. Results indicated that a greater 
quantity of MAP was mixed with DTBPC 70 mass%, which apparently created an 
endothermic peak after the first exothermic peak. Endothermic quantity also was 
increased while the volume of MAP was increased. This study was the first discovery 
of inhibition reaction on DTBPC 70 mass% by MAP.

Extinguishing agents are divided into four main categories; widely used are the first 
three classes of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), and 
amine dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4). Choosing the most effective 
extinguishing agent chemicals is very important. Currently, extinguishing agents are 
recycled as → drying → replenish. The treating process has not been evaluated for the 
treatment effectiveness after replenishment. A fire is diminished by the NH4H2PO4, 
which is one of the main research focuses in this study. DTBPC 70 mass% and 
TMCH 88 mass% were used to mix with the MAP for understanding the inhibition 
reaction under decompositions. This study considers the inhibition reaction of organic 
peroxide and extinguishing agents. 
In Taiwan, some manufacturers are basing decisions on cost savings, and so are 
recycling extinguishing agents by drying. Of course, the performance of the 
extinguisher agent is quite deteriorated. We used the third type extinguishing agent 
mixed with DTBPC 70 mass% and TMCH 88 mass% for analyzing the reaction 
mechanism of free radical inhibition and estimation. These experimental results could 
be available to fire-related agencies as a reference application. Disaster can be 
prevented in the first stage, and the results of this study are expected to aid fire safety 
for preventing an accident from occurring.

2.2. Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP) 
MAP was applied in this study to mix with DTBPC 70 mass% and TMCH 88 
mass%, and the components are described in Table 1; the decomposition reactions are 
shown in Fig. 3.

2.3. Well-known thermo analytical technique property 
Temperature-programmed screening experiments were performed with DSC (TA 
Q20). The test cell was used to carry out the experiment for withstanding relatively 
high pressure to approximately 10 MPa. ASTM E698 was used to obtain thermal

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Thermal analysis of DTBPC 70 mass% mixed with new MAP powder 
Experiments were divided into two parts. First, DTBPC 70 mass％ was conducted 
by 4℃/min. The second part was DTBPC mixed with different mass of MAP in 
heating rate of 4℃/min, and then curve fitting was used to evaluate the kinetic 
parameters based on experimental data. The experiment and curve fitting results are as 
shown in Figs. 4–9 and Tables 2–3. 
Tp of pure DTBPC 70 mass% was about 122℃, which had not changed while 
increasing the MAP. The ∆H of exothermic peak had significant reduction when the 
mass of MAP was increased from 0.5 to 1.4 mg. In addition, DTBPC 70 mass% had 
an endothermic reaction when the temperature was increased to 188℃. This was due 
to the DTBPC 70 mass% releasing free radical under decomposition reaction, which 
had combined with the MAP. When the mass of MAP was increased from 0.5 to 1.4 
mg, it increased the endothermic reaction from 11 to 35 kJ/g in 4℃/min. The 
above-mentioned results are shown in Fig. 4 and Tables 2–3. 
Figs. 5–9 show the exothermic peak analysis of time vs. heat production, 
exothermic peak analysis of time vs. heat production rate, exothermic peak analysis of 
TMR, exothermic peak analysis of TCL, and endothermic peak analysis of time vs. 
heat production for DTBPC 70 mass% mixed with MAP of 0.5, 0.7, and 1.4 mg in 
non–isothermal condition of 4℃/min, respectively.

3.3. Comparison of the kinetic parameters for new and old of MAP 
  DTBPC 70 mass% mixed with new or old MAP was compared at a heating rate of 
4℃/min. Mass of DTBPC 70 mass% was 3.0 and 2.8 mg; mass of MAP was similar 
ca. 1.4 mg. The ∆H of DTBPC mixed with old MAP was not significantly changed, 
but the ∆H changed, which was higher than new MAP at the endothermic peak. In 
addition, To or Tp were not changed significantly, while increasing the new or old 
MAP as shown in Fig. 16 and Table 6.  
  TMCH 88 mass% mixed with new or old MAP was compared at a heating rate of 4
℃/min. Mass of TMCH 88 mass% was 3.0 and 3.2 mg; the new MAP and old MAP 
were 1.2 mg and 1.3 mg, respectively. Both had not affected the ∆H at the exothermic 
peak. The ∆H of TMCH 88 mass% mixed with old MAP changed higher than new 
MAP at the endothermic peak. In this study, old MAP have higher endothermic peak 
due to the affected by the water vapor. Experimental and curve fitting results are 
shown in Fig. 17 and Table 7.
