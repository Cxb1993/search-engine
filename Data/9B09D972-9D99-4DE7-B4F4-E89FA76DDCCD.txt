Abstract 
    As mobile computing technologies 
advance in recent years, users can connect to 
the Internet with various forms of terminal 
devices. Thus, context-awareness has become 
an emerging topic for users to obtain their 
desired information in an easier and more 
effective way. In this project, we focus on 
developing data mining techniques to analyze 
environmental parameters so as to provide 
appropriate information to corresponding users. 
Thus, we start from identifying communities of 
mobile users. Specifically, both spatial and 
temporal information embedded in the call 
detail records is used for discovering users of 
similar tastes. Moreover, we also aim at 
developing recommendation systems which are 
capable of handling multi-criteria ratings and 
temporal dependencies, so that users can be 
recommended with interesting information. On 
the other hand, we study both the indexing and 
retrieval mechanisms for image data in addition 
to conventional text data. Finally, we propose 
to exploit browsing history of a user to support 
his or her web search tasks. 
 
Keywords: data mining, human-computer 
interaction, image retrieval, recommendation 
system, social network, web search

一、前言 
近年來隨著普及運算技術的興起，執行
計算的環境再也不限於大型主機或個人電
腦；此外，隨著行動通訊技術的進步，使用
者藉由不同終端硬體設備，可以在任意時間
與任何地方得到其所需之資訊。在本研究計
畫為期三年的執行時期中，探討的重點是在
一包含多媒體內容之資訊檢索系統中，如何
有效地根據使用者所處情境的差異自動地提
供最適切的資訊型態，而如何藉由資料探勘
技術來分析各種環境變數以求得使用者的行
為樣式，我們亦進行了廣泛的探討並據以完
成了深入的研究。 
 
二、研究目的 
    隨著行動通訊技術的進步，使用者可藉
由不同終端硬體設備在任意時間、地點得到
其所需之資訊。因此，情境感知計算開始成
為一個新興的研究課題，而如何藉由資料探
勘技術來分析各種環境變數以求得使用者的
行為樣式，並據以建立情境感知模型 [5][6][7] 
是本計畫的重點。 
為了分析各種環境變數，取得行動使用
者的行為模式，我們發現通聯記錄中含有使
用者的多樣資料，我們認為如何善加利用其
中有用的資訊並發掘出使用者的群組關係，
對之後的研究會有實際幫助，例如：相同群
組的成員們較可能具有同樣的偏好或專業背
景，因此其檢索行為亦可能有共通處。 
對於檢索系統而言，我們發現由於文字
檢索技術已相當成熟，但是以影像做為檢索
標的則較為困難，因此，影像檢索成為極有
價值的研究課題，特別是在現今手機多具備
照相功能的環境中，以相片影像進行查詢的
動機更為充分，更適合用在情境感知的主題
上，於是如何針對影像資料設計適合的檢索
系統亦為我們的研究重點。 
此外，檢索的歷程記錄包含了使用者的
目的及其檢索行為，若能夠運用資料探勘的
技術把有用但原本雜亂的資訊整理給使用
者，將能幫助使用者解決許多在進行資訊檢
索過程中出現的阻礙，像是對目的不了解或
不知道用什麼關鍵字找到目標等，這樣的檢
索 行 為 都 被 歸 類 為 探 索 式 的 搜 尋 
(exploratory search) ，我們認為這些問題值得
研發出一套可輔助檢索系統的有效機制。 
 
三、文獻探討 
發展情境感知能力之內容檢索系統的過
程中，我們研讀了許多方面的相關文獻。首
先，由於對於影像檢索的議題並非完全成
熟，我們在影像的特徵化處理做了相關文獻
討論。此外，我們期望一個檢索系統能夠擁
有推薦機制，以主動地提供使用者可能想要
的資訊，因此研究了常見的推薦技術。我們
亦研究了兩種理論以探討使用者的檢索行
為：探索式搜尋、採莓理論，以利於一檢索
系統在實用階段的精進。最後，如何善用歷
程記錄以對資訊檢索的結果強化，也在此節
中作了討論。 
 
3.1 基於內容之影像檢索  (Content-based 
Image Retrieval) 
  在發展具情境感知能力的內容檢索系統
中，我們特別對於影像的部分做了討論，由
於影像蘊含比文字更為豐富的資訊描述，用
來取代以文字為基礎的查詢方式，非常適合
運用在文字輸入不便的環境，如手持式裝
罝，而採用影像處理之技術來進行檢索相關
的任務。 
    在影像檢索的研究領域中，利用影像本
身內含之特徵進行比對、搜尋與關聯檢索等
工作，是一種以圖找圖、以圖找相關資訊的
概念 [8]。明確地來說，透過解析影像本身的
顏色、形狀、紋理、及空間佈局等來進行關
聯檢索，可先將欲辨識的物件或區域影像轉
3 
的資訊都會提供使用者新的想法以及概念，
促使使用者修正或統整目標的方向，由於使
用者搜尋資訊的過程並不是由一個步驟完成
搜尋，而是經過不斷的資訊修正前進方向，
最終取得目標資訊，而這樣的過程可以圖二
中的軌跡作為代表。 
 
3.4 網 頁 搜 尋 技 術 的 強 化  (Enhancing 
Techniques for Web Search) 
在資訊檢索的過程中，為了使搜尋所產
生的結果更合乎使用者的目標，提高搜尋結
果的品質，我們進行了以下幾項技術探討。 
 將原始的查詢自動地加上若干個相關的
關鍵字以進行重新查詢稱為擴展查詢 (query 
expansion) [16]。舉例來說，如果使用者想搜
尋一種咖啡 (java coffee bean)，但使用者一
開始卻僅使用  “java bean” 作為搜尋的詞
彙，結果系統列出一系列有關於 java 程式開
發的資訊，此時查詢擴張可發揮其作用，推
薦出 coffee 詞彙加入於原來的查詢讓使用者
使用更精確地得到想要之結果。 
 我們知道一個查詢詞彙可能有多種表示
的意義，而取得的結果也可能有多樣性，對
於搜尋結果分類 (clustering) [17] 也被學者
提出研究。對於階層式 (hierarchical) 的分類
可以分成由上到下 (top-down) 及由下到上 
(bottom-up) 的計算方式。由下到上是把每個
對象不斷融合相似的對象，由上到下是把所
有對象先當作是同一大類別，然後再逐步地
細分為多個子類別，每一個子類別亦可再進
一步地往下細分。 
在實用階段中，我們認為使用者檢索的
歷史瀏覽記錄中，隱含了重要的資訊可幫助
了解使用者的搜尋目的，其中最隨手可得的
應用已經存在於一般的瀏覽器上，例如微軟
的 Internet Explorer可將瀏覽記錄按照瀏覽時
間的先後順序排列，或單以一天為單位作為
基本的分類依據，此外也提供簡單的文字搜
尋以方便檢索過去的瀏覽紀錄。 
時間是記錄瀏覽記錄最基本的屬性，時
間軸 (timeline) 則是一般用於表現時間順序
的方式 [11]，有非常多網路應用選擇以時間
軸作為主要的介面去表現資料，如 Google 
News Timeline 與 Plurk 等。如何有效利用時
間的資訊，在資訊檢索這個領域為重要的議
題 [2]，雖然對於現有的瀏覽器有提供簡單方
法去尋找瀏覽過的記錄，但對於如何去更進
一步地組織這些瀏覽記錄目前卻只有較為鬆
散的方式，例如 Internet Explorer 只提供呈現
或搜尋過去紀錄之功能，而對於 Google Web 
History 這類的線上查詢歷史紀錄而言也只是
運用時間軸呈現過去的歷程，例如在時間軸
上列出查詢之後所點擊過的網頁標題與
URL，然而，除了運用時間的資訊去表達我
們檢索的結果外，我們要如何得知兩個瀏覽
過的網頁是否有相關，而又有多緊密的相關
性，應可發展出更適切的方式。 
 
四、研究方法 
針對本研究計畫的預期目標，我們首先
建立通聯資料的蒐集機制，並從通聯紀錄中
找出行動使用者社群，接著進入發展適用於
檢索系統的推薦機制，其後的研究重點著重
在於影像資訊的檢索，而透過資訊探勘技術
對於瀏覽紀錄的處理，產生並重整使用者所
想要的資訊，最後依據人機介面的互動模
式，提出合適的使用者介面來輔助檢索過
程。本計畫的研究方法主要分為以下項目： 
(1) 研讀行動通訊環境中應用服務之現況與
發展，並且運用演算法從通聯記錄中找
出行動使用者社群。 
(2) 對現有之影像檢索技術進行學習並深入
了解相關演算法，藉此規劃一影像檢索
系統與相關應用的開發。 
(3) 研究推薦系統中的評價機制，將推薦系
統中單一條件評價的觀念推廣成多個評
5 
在我們研究下發現一群熟識的行動使用
者具有以下兩個行為條件：(1) 熟識的行動使
用者會在某個特定的時間內與其他群組內的
行動使用者有通聯記錄；(2) 熟識的行動使用
者會在某個特定的時間與群組內的成員出現
在同ㄧ個地點。藉由以上的行為模式，我們
建立相關的資料探勘方法，並有效地找出了
隱含在通聯記錄中的行動使用者社群。 
 
5.2 推薦系統 (Recommendation Systems) 
情境感知運算的目標，是讓使用者可以
在任意時間與任何地方得到其所需之資訊，
因此如何有效地根據使用者所處情境的差異
自動地提供最適切的資訊，是實現情境感知
計算的具體工作。推薦系統的相關技術能夠
依據使用者的偏好、興趣、行為或需求，過
濾對使用者來說多餘的資訊，並提出使用者
可能有所需求的潛在資訊、服務或產品。在
此章節我們針對評價機制以及時間的相依性
討論對推薦系統的影響。 
在一推薦系統中，評價結構  (rating 
structure) 扮演重要的角色，我們成功地將單
條件 (single criterion) 的評價機制延伸為多
條件 (multi-criteria) 的評價機制，讓使用者
可對一潛在資訊、服務或產品進行多方面的
評價，例如針對某餐廳的評價可分為價格、
用餐環境、美味與服務品質等方面來分別評
價。此一多條件的評價機制及相關之推薦方
法將能更符合實務所需。 
而以時間相依性的觀點來看推薦系統，
使用者的喜好其實會隨著時間而變化，明確
而言，評價資料具有其生命周期，於是我們
定義了時間距離與使用期限這兩個參數，其
中兩筆資料間的時間距離，可經由生命週期
之定義推算得出，而使用期限則反映了資料
新鮮度的衰減速度，經過實驗證實，我們的
方法可以有效的降低推薦系統的誤差率，也
就是更能夠推薦該時間點最有用的資訊。 
 
5.3 以天際線擷取方法建構一地標影像之檢
索系統 (On Developing a Landmark Image 
Retrieval System with Skyline Extraction 
Techniques) 
由於多媒體的應用越來越重要，光是文
字檢索已不符實際需求，於是影像檢索便成
為新的研究課題。影像搜尋比文字搜尋複雜
很多，由於影像的特徵太多 (如顏色、形狀、
材質等)，難以決定哪個特徵才是最有用的。
而本研究中的影像檢索目標先侷限於包含地
標的影像，我們認為將對應之天際線先找出
來將有助於搜尋工作。 
我們先利用邊框偵測演算法找出邊框，
接著在這些邊框當中尋找真正的路徑以視為
此影像中之天際線，而這個找尋路徑的法則
類似深先搜尋 (Depth First Search) 演算法。
圖五為一個影像天際線的範例，我們經由實
驗已驗證了我們的方法相當正確且有效率。

可以進一步知道目標中心查詢為何種詞彙並
做檢索方向的轉移。 
我們發現，經由這樣的重新聚焦及縮小
搜尋範圍的方式進行檢索過程，確實能夠幫
助使用者尋找到適切的目標。 
 
5.5 支 援 探 索 式 網 頁 搜 尋  (Supporting 
Exploratory Search) 
在文獻探討中我們曾提及目前的瀏覽器
對於瀏覽紀錄的表示並沒有提供組織性的功
能，而為了使紀錄能夠被組織，使得使用者
能夠迅速的理解過去的檢索包含了哪些線
索，因此我們做了以下之研究。 
在進行探索式搜尋的過程中，使用者將
面對超過人腦短期記憶所能負荷的大量資
訊，此時，如果能有合適的方式來統整、記
錄這些資料，將有助於減輕使用者的負擔。
在著名的《哈利波特》小說中提到的「儲思
盆」 (Pensieve)，能用來儲存人腦的記憶，
留待使用者需要的時候可以反覆觀看並進行
思考。而我們認為這是一個很適合用在探索
式搜尋的構想，我們計畫提出一個實現此概
念的原型系統，並將此概念用來統整使用者
瀏覽記錄。 
當使用者在進行搜尋時，使用者的搜尋
與瀏覽過程將被記錄下來。每一組關鍵字與
瀏覽搜尋結果的過程被視為一個獨立的「程
序」(session)，瀏覽時間、網址、及網頁內容
也將一併記錄，作為分析之用。針對前述目
標，我們提供兩種使用者瀏覽模式：時間軸
模 式  (timeline mode) 與 關 聯 性 模 式 
(relevance mode)。 
 
圖九、時間軸模式 
 
在時間軸模式下，各程序依照時間排
列，並以使用不同的時間刻度來表示程序的
重要性，例如：較為重要的程序，將使用較
小的刻度來表示；而較不重要的程序則反
之。相較於一般使用相同刻度的記錄方式，
利用不同時間刻度來呈現能更加突顯程序間
重要程度的不同。 
 
 
圖十、關聯性模式 
 
在關聯性模式下，使用者瀏覽過程中所
記錄的資料將被分析，並以動態圖表呈現其
關聯性。在此模式下，使用者的瀏覽行為將
會影響程序間的關聯性，系統所呈現的資料
將更符合各種使用者不同的需求。 
我們更進一步結合上述兩種模式，使之
能夠相互搭配補強；對於使用重新聚焦、縮
小搜尋範圍之後所點擊的搜尋結果，我們把
它們放在「儲思盆」中以被有效地重新組織。
因此，互相搭配兩種系統能幫助使用者在資
訊檢索時清楚他們的過程，並且利用這些過
程去修正並且取得他們的檢索目標。

 A. Link Analysis of Online Social Networks 
The concept of a social network can be generally understood 
as a social structure consisting of nodes that are tied by one or 
more specific types of interdependency, such as 
communication, conflict, financial exchange, friendship, and 
trade. Since the nodes generally represent numerous 
individuals or organizations, the resulting graph-based 
structures are often very complex. Specifically, as users are 
getting used to communicate through various ways on the 
Internet, e.g., sending e-mails and instant messages or posting 
articles on a website, more and more research interests have 
been attracted to understand online social networks [6][15]. 
It is generally accepted that link analysis [7] is a feasible 
approach to handle the tasks in hypertext and web mining [3], 
relational learning, graph mining [5], and so on. Consequently, 
more than a few research problems on analyzing social 
networks are deeply concerned with link analysis techniques, 
e.g., the size and connectivity of communities, the number of 
connected components, the distribution of incoming and 
outgoing connections per node, and the average and maximal 
length of shortest path between any two nodes. It is also noted 
that problems of discovering co-citation relationships in 
documents, or finding user communities [4] are addressed in 
prior works. Nevertheless, most of the research efforts are spent 
on understanding social network structures, while little 
knowledge is obtained about the dynamics happening in such 
environments. A further time-dependent aspect of the problem 
is that social networks are not static, and particularly those on 
the Internet can evolve quite rapidly. We thus put our focus on 
understanding the evolutional processes among individuals in 
this work. 
B. Social Relationships in the Blogsphere 
In the blog space, dated entries are usually arranged in 
reverse chronological order so the most recent post appears first. 
This feature helps bloggers to quickly read new articles or 
opinions from others. In other words, many bloggers not only 
write their own articles but also read and then provide some 
feedback to others in the blogosphere. It is thus noted that 
interconnection among blogs can be formed with the following 
relationships, i.e., blogroll, citation, comment, and trackback. 
Consequently, social networks which are constituted of blog 
sites (or the corresponding bloggers) and corresponding 
interconnections can be identified. Moreover, the problem of 
mining interesting patterns from social networks in the 
blogosphere is widely addressed in several studies [2][8][9]. 
A fundamental process in social networks is that behaviors 
cascading from node to node like an epidemic. In the 
blogosphere, personal opinions can be significant to maximize 
the effect of “word-of-mouth” [11] since information may be 
diffused quickly among a large number of bloggers [1][10][14]. 
Previous studies have investigated the diffusion process for a 
possible application of viral marketing [13][16]. For example, 
as a customer is satisfied with a new product or service, his or 
her positive comments may result in significant influence of 
neighbors in the social network.

Influence Graph
 
Fig. 1.  An example blog graph and its corresponding influence graph (adapted 
from [12]). 
 
As a social network in the blogosphere is represented as a 
blog graph where links point to referred blog sites, a 
corresponding influence graph [12] can also be derived as 
shown in Fig. 1. Note that links between two identical bloggers 
are merged once their directions are identical. Moreover, the 
direction of every link in the influence graph is reverse to that 
in the blog graph since information propagates with reading 
behavior of bloggers. In other words, information sources are 
those bloggers who publish articles on their blog space and the 
corresponding destinations are bloggers who read and refer to 
these articles. Nevertheless, it is not a trivial task to track the 
reading behavior of all bloggers. Therefore, without loss of 
generality, we consider the subscription relationship to be a 
concrete indication to construct the influence graph in this work. 
Then, as is also noted in Fig. 1, a bi-directional link may also 
exist when two bloggers subscribe to each other so that 
information may propagate in both directions between them. 
 
III. DISCOVERING SHORTCUT PATTERNS FOR INFORMATION 
DIFFUSION 
To observe the phenomenon of information diffusion in the 
blogosphere, we propose to discover shortcut patterns from 
data streams of subscription records. Corresponding definitions 
and details of our approach are provided in Section III-A. 
Moreover, extensive discussions of possible applications of 
proposed shortcut patterns are made in Section III-B. 
A. Proposed Approach for Mining Shortcut Patterns 
Information can be diffused via interconnection among users 
in either the personosphere or the blogosphere. By collecting 
and extracting useful social relationships, we propose to find 
evolving shortcut patterns as time advances so as to observe the 
phenomenon of information diffusion. Specifically, the 
subscription relationship among a number of blog sites (or the 
corresponding bloggers) can be represented as a digraph G:=(V, 
A). In such a subscription graph, V is a set of vertices 
representing all the blog sites, including both publishers and 
subscribers, and A is a set of arcs representing the subscription 
relationships that start from subscribers and end to publishers. 
As mentioned earlier, it is noted that the direction of 
information propagation is reverse to that of a subscription. 
 shortcut patterns. Nevertheless, in the step of candidate pruning, 
we notice that not all vertices are possible candidates to be 
either a source or a destination in these shortcut patterns. Only 
vertices b, e and g (i.e., b and its ancestors) are destination 
candidates whereas only vertices a, d and f (i.e, a and its 
descendants) are source candidates. This is because only the 
distance between one of these destination candidates and one of 
these source candidates might be shortened due to the 
occurrence of the new subscription record b→a. 
 
  
Fig. 5.  Source and destination candidates involved with a new subscription 
b→a. 
 
Reducing the number of both the source candidates and the 
destination candidates undoubtedly helps to improve the 
efficiency of proposed approach for discovering shortcut 
patterns. In a later section of empirical studies, we have more 
evaluations on the performance of our approach when with or 
without this step of candidate pruning. 
B. Extending the Usefulness of Shortcut Patterns 
Information propagates with reading behavior of bloggers 
such as subscriptions, trackback of blog entries and so on. We 
thus regard the direct subscriptions as footprints of bloggers’ 
reading behavior in our studies. Also, it can be useful to 
understand what interests bloggers by following their footprints. 
As compared with the modeling of random walks in Web pages, 
adopting evidences that bloggers had left makes the analytic 
results close to reality. Hopefully, the discovery of information 
propagation patterns facilitates blog recommendations and blog 
advertisements, e.g., AdWords. 
Our proposed approach is not just designed for the ecology 
of the blogosphere. With a general definition of shortcut 
patterns, our approach can be applied in other social networks 
such as bibliography, bookmark sharing, online reviews for 
products, linkbacks (i.e., refback, trackback and pingback) of 
Web documents and so on. Taking the bibliography networks 
as an example, citations can be converted to links of reference 
relationships. Through similar analysis process proposed in this 
work, we may discover that some literatures may induce 
extensive resonance such as discussions, innovations or 
extended works. For applications in business, our proposed 
approach can be incorporated with the concept of viral 
marketing to capture and realize what promotes new products 
to the customers. Unlike the strategy of unidirectional mass 
marketing, mining the valuable human behaviors from 
customer reviews and discussions of their products can help to 
verify and then maximize the word-of-mouth effect. 
 
IV. EMPIRICAL STUDIES 
The experimental environment and the testing datasets are 
described in Section IV-A. Evaluation results of our approach 
in terms of the two parameters are presented in Section IV-B. 
Efficiency issues are studied in Section IV-C. 
A. Experimental Environment 
All of our experiments are conducted on a desktop PC with 
an Intel Pentium-4 3.0 GHz CPU and 1 GB main memory. For 
reducing the developing time, our approach is implemented 
with PHP 5.2.3 and Microsoft SQL Server 2000 is used as the 
database server. Moreover, all subscription records among 
numerous bloggers are crawled from “bloglines.com” which is 
a web-based personal news aggregator. 
Specifically, we choose two popular blog sites as the seeds 
for crawling our testing datasets. The first dataset contains all 
subscription records in which bloggers directly or indirectly 
subscribe to the RSS feed “National Geographic News: 
Animals & Nature.” Note that an indirect subscription means 
that the blogger does not subscribe to the original feed directly 
but some other blog sites subscribing directly or indirectly to 
the original feed. The second dataset contains all subscription 
records which correspond to the RSS feed “Digg.com.” Some 
basic statistics of these two datasets are depicted in Table 1 and 
Table 2, respectively.

& NATURE”

Data duration 2004/7/9~2008/1/23

B. Impacts of the Two Parameters for Shortcut Patterns 
First, we have an examination on the impact of the threshold 
max_period. Specifically, the value of max_period is 
progressively specified within the range of 5 to 100 days while 
the value of max_reduction is kept to be one, i.e., there is no 
limitation on the parameter of reduction ratio. As a result, the 
number of discovered shortcut patterns increases accordingly 
in both datasets as shown in Fig. 6. Although this is expectable, 
we put emphasis on determining an appropriate value of 
max_period for further analysis.

Fig. 8.  Efficiency improvement of utilizing candidate pruning on (a) dataset #1; 
and (b) dataset #2. 
 
Through an in-depth analysis, the number of candidates to be 
considered varies slightly even if the subscription graph keeps 
growing during the whole process of this experiment. This can 
be clearly illustrated by comparing the curves in Fig. 8(a). 
Nevertheless, it can be observed from Fig. 8(b) that the 
required execution time in the range of 70th to 91st iteration for 
dataset #2 significantly increases. The reason behind this is that 
much more subscription records suddenly occur (due to some 
events) during that period in our real dataset #2. In general, the 
strategy of utilizing candidate pruning in our approach is 
verified to be very effective in achieving better efficiency. 
Moreover, our approach is thus considered to be scalable in 
handling a growing graph. 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
As every user on the Internet is able to own his or her blog 
space as a platform to publish personal thoughts, ideas, 
comments or works in the Web 2.0 age, information can be 
propagated among individuals in an much easier way. On the 
other hand, the evolution of user communities in the 
blogosphere has attracted our interest in analyzing the 
dynamics in addition to their static structures. In this work, the 
phenomenon of information diffusion has been studied through 
the observation of evolving social relationships among 
bloggers. Specifically, it is noted that a social network can be 
formed with bloggers and corresponding subscription 
relationships. Moreover, the subscription of a blogger to 
another blog site may reflect that the distance among relevant 
bloggers is shortened due to information diffusion. Therefore, 
exploiting the reader communities of the specified blog sites 
can make us realize which information of the blog sites brings 
stream of people. Finally, we have devised in this work a new 
data mining capability, i.e., the shortcut patterns, and a proper 
approach to identify such patterns. Both theoretical and 
empirical studies have demonstrated that the proposed 
approach is efficient and effective in practical applications.

user does not know which keywords to use or looks for several answers, he usually 
needs to spend much time on querying and browsing activities to accomplish an ex-
ploratory search. 
When users try to investigate, evaluate, compare and synthesize information pieces 
grabbed during their exploratory search processes, they may encounter the data over-
loading problem due to the limited short-term memory of human beings. In view of 
this, an interesting concept which is inspired from the Pensieve in the famous series of 
novels “Harry Potter” is noted in this work. Specifically, the Pensieve is a fictional 
item used to store memories and to provide a near-omniscient perspective of the 
events to be relived later in the novels. To realize such a concept in practical applica-
tions, we propose to develop a proper approach for users to retain and to organize 
necessary information. 
Furthermore, we note that search sessions of a user are not totally irrelevant, espe-
cially when the goal of web search is for obtaining more and more knowledge, or 
more specifically, learning something new. Consequently, the browsing history of 
users can help them on not only reviewing previous search activities but also clarify-
ing next search targets. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the web browsing 
history is simply recorded in sequence and is usually loosely organized in previous 
works. For supporting the user needs of retrospecting their previous activities in ex-
ploratory search, we propose in this work to present and to organize browsing history 
of users in more feasible forms. Specifically, our goals are twofold. First, we expect 
to provide users a novel interface to support their historical retrospect. Moreover, 
relationship among search sessions should be identified to help users clarifying their 
thoughts and discover new insights. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Relevant works on exploratory 
search and usage of browsing logs are generally reviewed in Section 2. The concept 
and advantages of our approach are explored in Section3. In Section 4, implementa-
tion details of our approach are presented. This paper concludes with Section 5. 
2   Preliminaries 
The process of exploratory search and relevant information theories are generally 
discussed in Section 2.1. Moreover, in Section 2.2, we show how browsing logs can 
help to improve the user interactivity in web search. 
2.1   Exploratory Search 
Search can be considered as a specific type of information seeking behavior. Gener-
ally speaking, there are different stages for this goal-oriented and problem-solving 
process, i.e., problem recognition, problem definition, problem resolution, and solu-
tion statement [27]. With the advance of information technologies in recent years, 
web search has become an increasingly important part of most computer users. There 
are several previous works on improving search results or achieving personalized 
search. Typical techniques include reranking search results based on the personal 
profile [2,22,24], comparing search results of different search engines [18], and offer-
ing faceted search interfaces [12]. In addition, there are more and more works focus-
ing on the visualization of search results [7,8]. 
358 W.-L. Chen and W.-G. Teng 
In other words, the process of exploratory search usually consists of several sessions 
of keyword search and is significantly influenced by the current state of the searcher. 
2.2   Usage of Browsing Logs 
Logs of user activities can be feasible in discovering usage patterns and other applica-
tions. For seeking legal information, user interface tools based on search histories are 
developed [13] and the corresponding results show that the log information is useful 
for many information-seeking tasks. On the other hand, although current web brows-
ers are usually capable to offer users simple logs of their browsing history, there are 
only a few basic functions provided for users to access their logs. Usually the most 
recently-viewed websites are listed so that a user can easily revisit a site even if he 
forgets the corresponding URL. Also, a user can search the log to find some sites that 
he may have forgotten he visited.  
Note that time is the explicit information recorded with all entries in the browsing 
log. Thus, the timeline is a common approach to present time sequences [16,6] so that 
corresponding events can be organized in order. To provide a better visualization 
form, the utilization of timeline is adopted in many relevant works so that users can 
understand the relationship among information segments in a much easier way 
[1,3,6]. For example, news photos on Flickr can also be visualized as a time flow to 
demonstrate the evolving history [9]. Research papers can also be presented as a time-
line with the tool SIMILE [23]. Generally speaking, how to use the temporal informa-
tion effectively is already a crucial issue in the field of information retrieval [4,20]. 
For our purpose of exploratory search, the use of time for clustering and browsing 
online documents may provide information seekers a much distinct way than simply 
returning some documents in response to a query. 
To the best of our knowledge, the records of web browsing history are usually 
loosely organized in current web browsers. Thus, it is difficult to recognize dissimi-
larities among browsing records, not to mention to discover the valuable relevance 
among them. By analyzing the browsing history, browsing patterns of users can be 
used to recommend websites which users might be interested in [10]. Moreover, for 
users to get more personalized search results or to follow interesting trends in their 
web activities, Google also provides similar services for users to review their search 
history online [11]. In this work, we thus propose to exploit two significant types of 
information embedded within the browsing history, i.e., record time and document 
relevance, to provide users better interactivities in conducting the exploratory search. 
3   Exploiting Explicit and Implicit Information in Browsing Logs  
As users may feel lost in the large quantity of gathered data in exploratory search, we 
propose to organize the search activities based on both the explicit and the implicit 
information in browsing logs. Our approach of utilizing the explicit record time is 
illustrated in Section 3.1. Moreover, the discovery of implicit relevance among search 
sessions and the corresponding usage are presented in Section 3.2. 
360 W.-L. Chen and W.-G. Teng 
their thoughts to confirm their next directions in searching. In other words, relationship 
among previous sessions may help to facilitate the exploratory search since it can be a 
long-term learning process. This process is just like playing jigsaw puzzles, a user may 
gradually obtain some clues to place more pieces properly or suddenly encounter a 
bottleneck preventing him from moving forward. Consequently, search sessions of a 
user may not occur in series during a complete process of exploratory search. For ex-
ample, many users search for the business affairs in office hours and search for their 
casual hobbits after work. Thus, two successive search sessions can be quite irrelevant. 
Obviously, if the implicit relationship among search sessions can be identified 
from browsing logs, the search history can be further organized. Note that since each 
search session contains the corresponding query terms and a number of items, i.e., 
web pages in the search result, two relevant sessions may contain duplicate items. In 
other words, the number of duplicate items between two different sessions is used to 
measure the strength of their relevance. Moreover, browsed items and non-browsed 
ones should be of different interestingness to the user. Specifically, if there exists a 
duplicate item among relevance sessions and is not browsed by the user, then it is 
regarded as an interesting item. 
Interesting item

Fig. 3. Duplicate items is used for measuring the relevance among search sessions 
As shown in Fig. 3, there are three different search sessions represented as hollow 
circles in the example browsing history of a user. Grey and red dots represent the 
browsed items and non-browsed items, respectively. Dots in the overlap region stand 
for duplicate items. Therefore, the relevance between the yellow and the green ses-
sions is higher than that between the yellow and the blue ones. Also, an interesting 
item of this example is indicated in Fig. 3. 
4   Implementation of Proposed Interfaces 
To make previous concepts into practice, we propose new user interfaces to present 
the organized browsing history. Specifically, users can review their previous search 
activities in either the timeline mode or the relevance mode. Details of these two 
modes are illustrated in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, respectively.  
362 W.-L. Chen and W.-G. Teng 
Generally speaking, our approach in the relevance mode breaks through the hedge 
of the timeline. Hence, users may obtain more insights about their own browsing 
history. For the purpose of exploratory search, in addition to what users already 
know, they can extend the current knowledge base by creating more search sessions 
of relevant query terms.  
 
Fig. 5. Visualization of the browsing history in the relevance mode 
5   Conclusions 
As the tasks and goals involved with exploratory search are probably undefined and 
unpredictable, it is difficult and subjective for users to obtain insights during the 
search process. Much effort has been spent on studies in relevant fields, e.g., informa-
tion seeking and human-computer interaction. In this work, we have proposed to fully 
exploit the browsing history to help users clarify their thoughts and discover new 
insights during the process of exploratory search. With one of the motivations being 
to support users when keyword search is not enough, we have focused on developing 
novel user interfaces and interaction models that support the user in different ways. 
Hopefully, the feasibility and usability of web search for users can be further im-
proved as both the explicit and the implicit information of browsing history are 
properly utilized.

2   Related Work 
2.1   Importance of This Study 
The relationship between a person’s personality characteristics and his/her 
performances, behaviours has long been studied by psychologists. It is known that a 
person’s performances and behaviours are related to personality characteristics and 
background data to a certain degree. A number of theories suggesting certain levels of 
correlations between certain personality characteristics and certain performances have 
been proposed. [2][3][7][8][12] Some companies consider applicant’s job experience 
and performance as well as personality characteristics in recruitment. 
However, it is too complicated to interpret or to help make decisions in practice. 
Psychologists have attemptted to dig out all correlations between personality traits 
and performance behaviours. Ideally, a complete picture can be revealed by summing 
up all those theories. However, there is still a very long way to go to discover all 
correlations. 
On the other hand, the correlations can be too complicated to interpret or to help 
make decisions in practice. several personality traits may correlate with one 
performance like the third case in figure 1. However, some actual correlations can be 
as complicated as the forth case. In addition, each correlation has different coefficient 
(i.e. different strength and direction). Such relationships are difficult to be discovered 
through psychological researches and used by psychologists.

 An SVM-Based Predictive Schema of School Performance 777 
Behaviours includes 4 items – Absence, Lateness, participation in student clubs 
and leadership. 
The experiment is presented to validate the scheme in which we adopted Big-Five 
personality model for measuring personality profile and focused on undergraduate’s 
school performance and behaviours. Personality, biological data, performance and 
behaviour data of 120 undergraduates in Taiwan were collected through 
questionnaires. 90 of the datasets were used for training in SVM and the others were 
used for test and compared with the regression prediction.  
4   Results 
The input and output attributes we have chosen may or may not be correlated to each 
other, and they might not be suitable for prediction of person’s performance. Hence, 
the experimental results show that the prediction results of our model is not accurate 
enough. We expect to know which output attribute is suitable for prediction and 
which input attribute is able to affect person’s performance. After analyzing 
experimental results, we would like to make the prediction of person’s performance 
more practical. 
5   Conclusion 
The results does not show a very good prediction. Only several output items in our 
model have moderate levels of accuracy (r>0.3). The bad performance of the 
proposed schema and model can be owing to the design of questionnaire items. Most 
of the items are subjective reporting, and they do not have enough reliability and 
validity. On the other hand, Big-Five model may not necessarily be applicable to 
Taiwanese. Future studies can be done with in a strictly designed questionnaire.
