Two Dimensional Green’s Functions for the 
Piezoelectric Half-Space 
Shyh-Haur Chen, and Kuang-Chong Wu 
Abstract—A novel formulation for two-dimensional self-similar anisotropic 
elastodyamic problems is generalized to piezoelectric materials. By making use of the 
formulation, the general solution of the displacements is expressed in terms of the 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a related eight-dimensional eigenvalue problem. 
Without the need of performing integral transforms as required in the well-known 
Cagniard-de Hoop method, the present formulation can be utilized to obtain 
expressions of analytical solutions directly. In the study, the method is applied to 
derive the explicit dynamic Green’s functions in the piezoelectric half-space. 
Numerical examples for the quartz of the semi-infinite region are illustrated. 
Keywords：dynamic Green’s functions, piezoelectric half-space.

1. Introduction 
Because of the intrinsic anisotropic elastic features of piezoelectric materials, many 
analytic methods for piezoelectric solids are derived from those for the general 
anisotropic elasticity. The Green’s functions, which relate the mechanical 
displacements and electric potential at a point to the concentrated forces or charges 
applied at another point, play an important role in understanding analytically 
mechanical or electrical behavior of loaded piezoelectric materials. 
Lothe and Barnett [1] developed an integral formalism for surface waves in 
piezoelectric half-infinite solid. They [2] also considered the existence of surface 
waves in piezoelectric half-space subjected to various boundary conditions. Taylor 
and Crampin [3] considered the circumstances for the propagation of surface waves in 
a homogeneous anisotropic piezoelectric half-space. Their study revealed that the 
particular form of anisotropic symmetry with respect to the direction of propagation 
critically affects the properties of the surface waves. Peach [4] extended the results of 
Lothe and Barnett [1] for the anisotropic materials to those for the piezoelectric 
materials. He presented general existence theorems for surface waves on piezoelectric 
substrates. Gao and Noda [5] developed an exact solution for the static Green’s 
functions of a half-infinite piezoelectric solid. Their work showed that the normal 
component of the electric displacement on the solid surface is not zero and is 
dependent on the applied loads and the electro-elastic constants of the piezoelectric 
material and air.  
The Stroh formalism is widely recognized as an elegant and powerful analytic 
Equations (3) and (4) can also be combined as

where * ,  , =1,2,3IK IK I Kδ δ= , IKδ  being the Kronecker’s delta and

of the generalized displacement u  as 
*

For two-dimensional problems in which the generalized displacement

Consider the generalized displacement u  in the following form 
1 2 4( , , ) ( ) ( )x x t w tψ= +u u e ,                  (10) 
where 1 2( , , )w x x t  is defined implicitly by 
1 2 1 2( , , , ) ( ) 0w x x t wt x p w xΔ = − − = ,             (11) 
with ( )p w  as an analytic function of w , ( )tψ  a function of t , and

∂Δ′ ′Δ = = −∂ ,                (13) 
and ( )p w′  is the derivative of ( )p w  with respect to w . Equation (12) shows that 
for the generalized displacement u  given by (10) to be a solution to (8), ( )wu  must 
satisfy (12) and ( )tψ  is arbitrary. 
By letting ( )w′u  have the following form  
( ) ( ) ( )w f w w′ =u a ,                        (14) 
where ( )f w  is an arbitrary scalar function of w . It follows that u  is a solution of 
(8) if 
( , ) ( ) ,p w w =D a 0                          (15) 
where ( , )p wD  is given by 
2 2ˆ( , ) ( )Tp w p p wρ= + + + −D Q R R T I .           (16) 
For non-trivial solutions of ( )wa  we must have 
( , ) 0,p w =D                           (17) 
where D  is the determinant of D . Equation (17) provides eight eigenvalues of p

Equation (26) can be cast into the following eight-dimensional eigenvalue problem

3. Dynamic Surface Green’s Function 
Consider a piezoelectric half-space 2 0x ≥ . The surface at 2 0x =  is assumed 
traction-free mechanically and insulating electrically. A line impulse force ( )tδh  
and a line impulse charge ( )q tδ , ( )tδ  being the Dirac delta function, are applied at 
the origin. The surface is mechanically traction-free ( 2
E =t 0 ) and electrically 
insulating ( 2 0D = ), where 2 12 22 32( )E Tσ σ σ=t . Then the corresponding 
conditions on the boundary 2 0x =  are given by 
2 1 1( , ) ( ) ( )x t x tδ δ= −t F ,                       (31) 
where 1 2 3( , , , )
Th h h q= −F . 
As in the case of unbounded media (Wu and Chen, [10]), the generalized stresses 
are homogeneous of degree -2 and the generalized displacement u  homogeneous of 
degree -1. Thus the fictitious generalized displacement *u  given by 
*
1 2 1 2( , , ) ( , , )
t
x x t x x dτ τ−∞= ∫u u ,                 (32) 
is homogeneous of degree 0. The conditions for the corresponding fictitious 
generalized stress *2t  is 
* *
2 1 2 1 1( , ) ( , ) ( ) ( )
t
x t x d x H tτ τ δ−∞= = −∫t t F .          (33) 
The general expression for the generalized stress vector *2t  as given by (23) can be 
rewritten in the following matrix form: 
* 4( ) ( )Ft c t
t
ψ π ε= + ,                        (44) 
where ( )c t  is a regular function of t . Since only the spatial variation of the electric 
potential *( )tφ  is of interest, we can let ( ) 0c t =  (Wu and Chen, [10]). The actual 
generalized displacement u , which is the same as the fictitious generalized velocity 
*u , is obtained as 
*

where sf

The Green’s functions given by (48) were computed next for quartz, which is a 
crystal of trigonal 32 symmetry class. The Green’s functions may be expressed in the
