for head-on impact 、 35°-inclined impact and 
50°-inclined impact. Three porous sheets of fiber 
glass、satin and cotton are arranged in front of these 
models. The averaged specific weight of the fiber 
glass, satin and cotton are 2.19 g/cm^2, 0.661 
g/cm^2 and 1.18 g/cm^2 as the measurement results 
shown on Fig. 2.5.

3. Results and Discussions 
3.1 The color schilieren flow visualization 
 
  The Interaction of a shock over porous sheet 
barrier with the ranges of Mach number 1.30-1.69  
and sheet barrier inclined angles of (0°,35°,50°) 
have been examined. With the vertical hanging of 
sheet model. The results show that planar shock 
passes through the porous sheet barrier, bifurcating 
into a transmitted shock and a normal reflected 
shock. The micro jets between the porous sheet 
barrier and transmitted shock has been observed. 
For sheet barrier of cotton, the micro jets are shown 
clearly. However, for sheet barrier of Satin, the 
micro jets are mistiness. The typical color schlieren 
pictures are shown on Fig. 3.1(a),(b),(c).
