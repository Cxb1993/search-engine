ABSTRACT 
 
Appropriate prediction of protein domains from three-dimensional structures or protein sequences is 
an essential task in understanding protein evolution and structure-function relationship. It is one of the 
most important and challenging problem in computational biology. Though several tools have been 
developed to predict protein domains from either structures or sequences, there are always some 
domains that conflict the basic principles of the algorithm and result in wrong boundary identification. 
Hence, an improved algorithm for diverse nature of domains and consistent performance is desired. 
This is a two-year project, the main goal of this proposal is to develop an automatic algorithm for 
domain segmentation from either a protein structure or a protein sequence, and construct all the 
domain feature vectors based on the either domain templates or length encoded secondary structure 
profiles. According to the verified domain vectors, feedback constraint information, template-based 
matching techniques, and divide-and-conquer strategy for automatically partitioning protein domain 
become achievable and preferable. In this project, there are four tasks were completed: (1) a protein 
domain database is built and an automatic segmentation mechanism was designed. A novel feature 
based on information of  secondary structure types and length was proposed to facilitate the 
traditional BLAST analysis. (2) An angle-distance image based protein classification system was 
designed. The proposed AD image feature can accurately classify proteins into correct clusters.  (3) 
An internal repeat detection system for protein structures or sequences was designed. The system 
collected all possible domain-, solenoid-, fibrous-repeat units and applied these fundamental units as 
basic template for repeat recognition. (4) A protein surface comparison system was designed for 
conformationally changed proteins. Novel features based on geodesic distance were proposed to 
maintain rotational, translational, and conformational invariant properties. All these systems can be 
applied to facilitate the protein-protein and protein-ligand interaction, protein docking, and binding site 
recognition, and they are useful for the applications of drug discovery and biological experiment 
design.

白質凾能區域自動切割技術；(二)蛋白質結構分類技術；(三)蛋白質內部重覆結構自動辨識分析
技術；(四)蛋白質表面結構比對技術。 
 
(一) 蛋白質凾能區域自動切割技術 
本系統對蛋白質凾能域的自動切割技術仍是以傳統的序列比對技術為基礎，無論輸入的查詢
資料是序列或是結構型態，第一步驟都是擷取蛋白質序列資料進行查詢比對，比對資料庫是由本
實驗室從SCOP及Pfam資料庫所定義的蛋白質凾能域資訊所分析整合的資料庫，該資料庫目前收錄
有40,407個凾能域、5,146,238筆序列資料及258,645筆結構資料。進行序列比對時，若是序列相
似度過低，系統自動由結構檔案擷取二級結構資訊或透過預測方式進行下一步二級結構特徵檔案
的比對。二級結構的特徵檔案主要是由四種不同的預測技術凿括PSIPred、Sable2、 SSPro4、和
Predator等四種預測技術，所有蒐錄的蛋白質序列亦事先進行預測並編碼後依不同預測技術分別
存檔，以函快後續比對速度及同一方法預測結果的一致性。將待測序列所預測出的二級結構經由
編碼技術，將α-螺旋、β-平板和隨機線圈三種不同類型的二級結構單元函上相對應的長度資訊
轉換為一個編碼序列特徵向量，透過編碼序列再進行動態演算法的快速比對，找出序列內容相似
度低，但是結構相似度高的蛋白質序列。如圖(1)範例所示，兩條序列胺基酸內容經跨物種演化後，
內容的相似度極低(2.84%)，但是經過預測二級結構的組成分析及二級結構類型與長度的編碼後卻
具有高度的相似性。 
圖 (1) 上圖為兩條序列經過二級結構特徵向量轉換後的比對結果，序列分別是
ENSP00000324648 (Homo sapiens) and ENSCINP00000020138 (C. intestinalis)；下圖為相對應
的序列內容。序列相似度僅為2.84%，但是二級結構的分布極為相似，且兩條序列皆已經被註解與
P450酵素相關的基因序列。 
 
(二) 蛋白質結構分類技術： 
針對已解析結構的蛋白質可以依據二級結構保留的相對位置進行自動分類。結構中，任何成
對的二級結構(泛指 α-螺旋和 β-平板)可以計算出角度-距離參數值，計算出所有可能配對的二
級結構組合，並依其類別的組合分別填入角度-距離圖(Angle -Distance Image, A-D 圖)，如圖
(2)所示，每一個結構相對產生三個 A-D 子圖，分別代表該結構內部由 α-α、α-β 及 β-β 不
同組合的 A-D 子特徵圖，可以分別存入一張彩色影像的 RGB 圖。若是結構在幾何空間分布情形相
似，則該影像內容相似度高，反之亦然。因為該特徵是取相對空間位置之計算，所以具有旋轉不
變特性。系統的分析流程首先將每一個結構進行向量化的計算，透過結構內部自我分析建構出三
張 A-D子影像圖，再分別對兩個結構的相似度進行 R-R、G-G及 B-B子圖的交叉比對，最後以正規

(三)蛋白質內部重覆結構自動辨識分析技術 
蛋白質序列或結構內部的重複特徵對蛋白質的摺疊、凾能、穩定性及基因演化分析提供重要
的資訊。研究指出約有 14%以上的蛋白質結構具內部序列或結構重複的特徵，為正確預測分析一條
序列或一個結構是否具有重複凾能域或內部結構重複的特性，本研究結合蛋白質的一級序列、預
測的二級結構或已解析的三維結構資訊進行序列比對及自相關分析，並建構一套可以分別偵測蛋
白質序列或蛋白質結構內部重複樣式的系統。本研究已經完整分析並建置蛋白質結構重複樣式的
基本單元資料庫(Internal Repeat Unit, IRU)，凿括凾能域重複結構、螺旋式重複結構及纖維狀
片段的重複基本單元，並作為後續自動辨識待確認蛋白質序列或結構是否具有內部重複之模版特
徵。若輸入資料為蛋白質序列，使用序列比對 IRU 資料庫或自相關演算法分析該序列是否具有凾
能域重複或胜肽片段重複，系統藉由傳統序列的排比演算法進行比對資料庫中已知凾能域及基本
重複樣式之序列，確認是否含有類似資料庫中的重複特性。當序列相似度過低造成無法辨識時，
則進一步預測序列的二級結構並分析相對應二級結構的長度編碼特徵向量，透過該向量進一步比
對二級結構的重複資訊是否存在。若輸入蛋白質已經具有解析的幾何結構，系統則使用結構排比
演算法從基本樣式資料庫中逐一進行結構比對，並確認是否具有連續性地重複存在同一樣式之基
本結構。圖(4)顯示兩種不同類型重複結構蛋白經本系統自動辨識及切割的範例，透過本計畫所開

本計畫創新技術說明 
 
 本計畫為分別完成四套不同的生物資訊工具，每一套系統皆有獨特創新的特徵。第一套是建
構蛋白質凾能區域自動切割辨識的技術開發，為輔助傳統 BLAST 技術在跨遠親物種比對的不足之
處，本計畫提出以二級結構資訊所建構的特徵向量，尤其對尚未解析出蛋白質結構之序列，透過
二級結構特徵向量交叉比對及驗證，快速搜尋確認所有已知的蛋白質結構是否具有相同之特徵，
以提升蛋白質凾能區域切割的正確性。第二套系統提出二級結構相對位置的組合特徵，該特徵具
有旋轉不變量之特性，可以將 3D 結構轉換為 2D 影像，可函速進行蛋白質自動分類應用。第三套
系統的特徵是提出自動辨識分析蛋白質是否具有重覆結構之現象，從凾能區域到短胺基酸片段的
重複狀態，皆能自動辨識及分類。最後一套系統則是以測地線距離為主，提出蛋白質表面的比對
分析技術，該特徵向量具備構型變化但特徵向量不變的優點，可以正確分析具動態變化的蛋白質
結構，並協助後續進行互動結合位置預測之基礎。 
 
 
技術推廣及運用的價值 
 
本計畫所完成之系統及資料庫的建構，可以普遍應用在蛋白質序列或結構的自動分析與分
類，透過特徵擷取及跨物種的分析比較，提供正確分析蛋白質的凾能及相關特徵。除瞭解蛋白質
序列及結構的凾能外，為函快系統的比對速度，本計畫所完成的系統模組，部分採用CUDA程式撰

query protein and the target protein are superposed according to the best contact map and the GANGSTA 
score is normalized by the number of aligned residues. SCALI (Yuan and Bystroff, 2005) is an efficient 
structural core alignment via finding the conserved packing arrangement regardless of the sequential 
connectivity in space. Proteins sharing a common core may possess the local sequence-structure similarity 
which can be exploited to align structures with distinct topologies. KENOBI (Szustakowski and Weng, 
2000) is a two-step method for aligning any two three-dimensional protein structures with or without 
sequential connectivity. The first step is to determine the initial SSE alignment by genetic algorithms. After 
refining the SSE alignment, the backbones of two proteins are superposed to search the equivalent residues 
in turns. OPPAS (Shih et al., 2006) is a protein structure comparison method for handling alternative 
alignment problems. It begins a rough alignment depending on the “matched” SSE pairs generated by 
probability-based estimation, and then the new superposition replaces the rough alignment by a 
least-square fitting procedure iteratively until nothing changed for C  pairs or reaching the maximum 
runs of superposition. USM (Krasnogor and Pelta, 2004) relies on the concept of the Kolomogorov 
complexity to measure the similarity metric of two proteins. The Kolomogorov complexity for Universal 
Turning Machine can be expressed or substituted as variant techniques, such as various compression 
measurements (JEPG, GIF, MEPAG4, etc.). Both types of sequential and non-sequential alignments indeed 
provide precise residue level measurement for protein structure similarity. However, to achieve the aims of 
protein structural classification, a strategy based on peptide level analysis may provide more efficient ways 
for structural comparison.  
The main goal of this study is to propose a pre-analysis mechanism of mutual correlation of secondary 
structures which especially emphasizes on its availability of high-accuracy in protein structural comparison 
(PSC) despite low protein sequence similarity. To reduce the computational cost of PSC, the proposed 
methodology transforms the spatial information from three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional map 
by exploiting the intra- and inter- secondary structure relationship which have been considered as 
conserving the evolutionary heritage of diversity of functional proteins. This strategy indeed provides a 
robust computation based on the mutual correlation of SSE pairs for highly divergent sequence data. 
 
Methodology 
 
   SSEs are highly conserved elements in the geometry space. Any pair of SSEs provides important 
spatial information such as included angle, relative distance, and rigid length. The information could be 
utilized to comprehend protein structure shapes without considering SSEs connectivity in space. In this 
project, we have proposed a novel, simple, but effective method to compare any two protein structures 
based on mutual relationship of SSEs. 
  The system flowchart in Figure 1.1 explains the workflow of the proposed method. At the beginning, the 
input data is two protein structures in PDB file format. In order to standardize secondary structure 
assignment, Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure (DSSP) (Kabsch and Sander, 1983), a method 
which exploits calculating the hydrogen bounding is employed. The imported PDB files are processed by 
DSSP program and assigned with different types of SSEs respectively. After that, each SSE is transformed 
into a vector by a vector transformation procedure. Every two SSEs in a protein structure form an SSE pair, 
and each pair possess attributes involving types of SSEs, a variety of distance, included angle, and length 
of vectors. For each protein, the mutual distance and corresponding included angle of each SSE pair are 
calculated and annotated as a point, and which point is allocated in one of three different Angle-Distance 
sub-images (A-D sub-images for short) according to various combinations of SSE types. Subsequently, in 
the light of corresponding type of A-D sub-images for these two imported proteins, the local 
cross-correlation scores are calculated by considering the nearest neighboring dots and the length of 
vectors (see the Angle Distance Comparison section). According to quantity of SSE pairs, the local 
cross-correlation scores are normalized by different weighted coefficients for A-D image comparison. The

For solving an eigenvalue problem with symmetry matrix A, the Jacobi method is employed to obtain all 
eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors, and then substitute them into distortion 2D  function 
for further analysis. Finally, due to possible solutions including both minimum and maximum cases, all of 
them are examined and evaluated in order to pick up the appropriate minimum results. Figure 1.2 shows an 
example of vector transformation where the vectors are formulated from a set of atoms and their 
coordinates.

respectively. 1EUMA and 1KRQA are classified into the Ferritin-like fold from all alpha class, where as 
1QOIA and 1MZWA come from Cyclophilin-like fold belongs to all beta class.

Figure 1.4: (a) Left superimposed A-D images of PDBs: 1EUM (chain A, red) and 1KRQ (chain A, blue). (b) Right 
superimposed A-D images of PDBs: 1QOI (chain A, red) and 1MZW (chain A, blue).  The dots represent the intra-relations of 
SSE pairs of two different structures in red and blue, respectively. Two-number annotation under each dot stands for the vectors‟ 
indices of an SSE pair. 
 
One dot in an A-D image represents a SSE pair of a protein structure and various colors represent 
different protein structures. Resorting to this image, it can be easily observed that similar protein structures 
possess similar distribution of dots. In addition to the attributes of angle and distance, each dot also retains 
the length and type information of SSEs. If a suitable connection can be linked among the dots of different 
proteins, the nearest neighbors of same type could be considered as the best choice for further A-D image 
comparison. In addition, for raising comparison accuracy and reducing time complexity for any two A-D 
images, each image will be decomposed into three types of A-D sub-images, namely, R, G, and B 
sub-images. Each sub-image is composed of SSE pairs with types of Helix-Helix, Sheet-Helix or 
Helix-Sheet, and Sheet-Sheet respectively.  
 
Angle Distance Image Comparison 
  With the A-D image representation for a protein structure, a PSC problem is translated into an image 
template matching scenario regardless of structures‟ translation, rotation and scaling in space. Each protein 
is assigned as a template image and performed matching processes with all other A-D images called as 
target images. The most similar target image from all other protein structures can be found for the assigned 
template image. Here, a variant cross-correlation function considering local property of a specific block is 
designed in the A-D image and named as local cross-correlation. If the template image and the target 
images are similar, it will possess a high local cross-correlation score. Accordingly, each dot in a block of 
the template image is taken into account for finding a nearest dot from the target image based on the 
highest local cross-correlation score. 
 Cross-correlation is a standard method for evaluating the degree of two images which are correlated 
based on the similarity of distributed grey levels. The template image needs to shift whole image to seek 
the highest cross-correlation value against the target image. However, for the A-D image comparison, the 
shifting processes are limited applied due to the template and target images should be compared in the 
same range of measurements of mutual distance and included angle. Therefore, the shifting processes of 
template image over the target image are not required and the computational requirements for searching an 
optimal correlation value are tremendously reduced.

of a specified vector pair. kV  and lV  represent two vectors of the k
th
 and l
th
 SSE pairs respectively. 
The score of s ( k , l ) approaches 1 when the k
th
 and l
th
 SSE pairs possess equal lengths for 
corresponding vectors. On the other hand, the score will be much less than 1 when the k
th
 and l
th
 SSE 
pairs preserve non-equally proportional vector length even these two pairs possess identical mutual 
distance and included angle. If either the Euclidean distance or similarity score between two SSE pairs is 
below thresholds, the corresponding pair in both proteins will be ignored. With this length scoring function, 
the mathematical formula represented in Equation (13) for  ,T A BAD AD  can be defined as  
 ,T A BAD AD  = 
k
lks ),(  (13) 
, where k  is all possible SSE pairs in the template image, l  is the nearest SSE pair from the target image 
which possesses the qualified length score with respect to the k
th
 pair.  
  The competition situation might appear for two close SSE pairs in the template image ADA while they 
match the same dot in target image ADB simultaneously. In such case, the one who owns the minimum 
Euclidean distance with that dot in ADB obtains higher priority. For solving such a competition problem, a 
sorting strategy is applied. Firstly, for each SSE pair k from ADA , all of its possible neighbors 'l  satisfied 
default distance threshold are considered and corresponding distances are stored in a two dimensional array 
D  in an ascending order. Consequently, a linear scan for the sorted array comparing with mutual 
correlated length score of any two filtered SSE pairs is performed to select the best candidates. Standing on 
the above procedure,  BAT , , A B , and BA,  can be appropriately calculated for the unique and 
optimal matching between two proteins. 
 
Result and Discussion 
 
  The purpose of this study is to develop a novel and efficient solution for PSC. Several existing 
benchmark datasets were utilized to evaluate the proposed method. Based on the calculation of mutual 
similarity distances among all protein pairs, clustering results for all testing datasets were exhibited by 
hierarchical or circular phylogeny trees  generated by Clustering Calculator 
(http://www2.biology.ualberta.ca/jbrzusto/cluster.php#VisualizeTree) and MEGA4 (Tamura et al., 2007). 
In this report, the single linkage clustering technique was employed for generating a phylip tree for 
visualization. Besides, the phylip tree generated from Clustering Calculator can be reconstructed as a 
graphical hierarchical or circular phylogeny tree by employing MEGA4 standalone package for convenient 
observation. 
 
Case1: Novel dataset from SCOP 
  All 129 proteins structures randomly selected from six super-families in SCOP database were perfectly 
clustered as our expectations. Based on the mutual correlation analysis of SSE pairs, these proteins were 
categorized into six various super-families, and which belongs to all alpha(Cytochrome P450), all 
beta(Heat shock protein), alpha+beta(Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferases and RNase A-like), and alpha/beta 
(Caspase-like and TIM beta/alpha-barrel) respectively.  In Figure 1.5, various colors were used to display 
different super-families.

revealed that two identical proteins can be well allocated by our approach such as 2ACH and 2ACHA. 
 
Figure 1.6: Clustering results of Leluk-Konieczny-Roterman dataset. All proteins were in the same SCOP family, serpins, from 
multi-domain class(alpha and beta). All of them were divided into 3 domains, Antithrombin represented by the character „#‟, 
Ovalbumin indicated by the character „^‟, and Antichymotrypsin, alpha-1 shown by the character „%‟. The hierarchical tree was 
drawn by Cluster Calculator and MEGA4. 
 
Case3: Chew-Kedem dataset 
  The proteins included in Chew-Kedem dataset were well clustered and depicted in Figure 1.7. At first 
glance, the protein 1ct9 with brown color representation located at the left-middle part of the figure looks 
like misplaced, but it is indeed different from other protein structures shown with brown color edges and 
annotated with character „^‟ in SCOP classification. The protein 1ct9 is a multiple domains protein which 
is classified into Adenine nucleotide alpha hydrolase-like fold within alpha/beta class and Ntn 
hydrolase-like fold within alpha+beta class. The proteins possessing the same tag „^‟ with 1ct9 are 
categorized into P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases fold within alpha+beta class.

SCOP classification, which are „$‟:Globins, „+‟: all alpha, „*‟:all beta, „#‟:Tim-Barrel, and „^‟:alpha and beta. The 4-character 
strings such as „a.1.1.2‟ appeared behind PDB ID represent the codes defined by the SCOP classification scheme to express the 
classification level. The circular phylogeny tree was drawn by Cluster Calculator and MEGA4.

beta-strand. It consists of three alpha helices and two beta-strands and it was classified into alpha beta class in CATH 
(Orengo et al., 1997). The SSE structures of 1B7IA are defined in DSSP program (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) and 
visualizes by Jmol viewer (http://www.jmol.org/). 
 
Case5: Protein Kinase dataset 
  In this dataset, there were nine distinct HH Clusters employed in this study. To observe the clustering 
degree, and which were further divided into sub-clusters according to their maximum common features. 
These sub-clusters were labeled with letters behind the original HH cluster number. For example, HH 
cluster 1 was grouped into three sub-clusters, 1A, 1B, and 1C, based on its common species feature. 
Another example, HH cluster 4 was categorized into two sub-clusters, 4A and 4B, for the common class.    
  Clustering results for kinase proteins are shown in Figure 1.10. From the figure, the proposed method 
can successfully cluster the major part of kinase proteins into appropriate datasets up to the domain level 
regardless of the sequence similarity. These major groups are shown in the highlighted green boxes, for 
instances, cAMP-DEP. PK, c.s. domain(cluster 1A, 1B and 1C), PK C-delta domain(cluster 2), Calmodulin 
domain(cluster 4B), Casein kinase-1, CK1 domain(cluster 5B), Cyclin-dep. PK, CDK2(cluster 6), multiple 
domain case(cluster 7A, the 1AD5A and the 2HCKA), Insulin receptor domain(cluster 7C, the 1IRKA and 
the 1IR3A), MAP kinase p38 domain(cluster 8B), and Twitchin(cluster 9A and 9B). In addition to the 
domain level classification, proteins framed in blue boxes indicating proper clustering results in the family 
level. The rest proteins shown in red boxes, such as 1PHK(cluster 3), 1LR4A(cluster 5A), 1A06(cluster 
4A), 1CWEA and 1CSYA(cluster 7B), are seemed to be mis-clustered at first glance. However, to verify 
the correctness of structural classification, a segment-based CE (Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998) alignment 
was employed to facilitate the justification of the clustering results. Through the alignment results, these 
disputable proteins were still appropriately clustered into their best groups. For instance, the protein 
1LR4A(cluster 5A) possesses the highest Z-score 6.8 and the lowest average RMSD 2.6 with 
1KOA(cluster 9A) than other proteins, 1CSN and 2CSN, in the same cluster 5B. Similarly, the protein 
1A06(cluster 4A) picked 2PTK(cluster 7A) as its closest matched protein with the highest Z-score 6.0 and 
the lowest average RMSD 2.8 than other proteins such as 1CDMA (with a Z-score of 2.3 and an average 
RMSD of 6.6 against 1A06) and 1CMLA(with a Z-score of 2.8 and an average RMSD of 7.0 against 1A06) 
in the same cluster 4B. Though the proteins of 1AOTF and 1CWEA belong to cluster 7B, they were also 
demonstrated that these two proteins possess the highest Z-scores of 5.9 and 6.0 and the lowest average 
RMSDs of 2.3 and 1.6 with respect to 2PTK (cluster 7A) and 1AD5A (cluster 7A) individually rather than 
the proteins in cluster 7B.  These relationships can be clear observed from the hierarchical tree structure 
shown in Figure 1.10. For the last protein 1PHK, the only one protein in the cluster 3, has demonstrated 
possessing the highest cross-correlation coefficient with protein 1YDSE (cluster 1C) by our approach. By 
employing CE algorithm and evaluation, this protein indeed possess higher structural similarity with 
proteins in cluster 1, such as 1YDSE(1C) with a Z-score value of 7.2 and an average RMSD of 1.4 and 
1BKXA(1B) with a Z-score value of 7.2 and an average RMSD of 1.3. Therefore, it is reasonable to cluster 
the protein 1PHK into the group of 1A/1B/1C according to the proposed matching mechanism based on the

(二) Internal Repeat Identification System 
Introduction 
  Protein repeats play an important role in understanding genome evolution and biological functions of 
proteins [1]. There are about 25% of proteins possessing repeated structures and which provide useful 
information for protein function analyses [2]. Recent studies have shown that innovative genes were 
evolved through the duplication and transformation from existing genes, and such duplications within a 
protein possessed regular secondary structures and produced multiple repeats in 3D structures [3]. 
Duplications in a protein can be short, down to small segments of amino acids, such as the antifreeze 
protein (1ezg) [4] or large, up to containing multiple domains, such as hemachrome (1la6) [5]. 
In recent years, various repeating structure detection have been extensively studied.  Several tools 
for detecting repeats in DNA sequences or protein structures were developed and published, such as 
Tandem Repeat Finder [6], Reputer [7], Reseek [8], and CGSSR [9] for DNA sequence repeats, whereas 
Swelfe [10] and REPRO[11] for protein level repeat detection.  For internal repeat detection at protein 
level, when the protein structures were not resolved, most of the methods for identifying repeats were 
based on the multiple sequence alignment strategies. The information of secondary structure was not 
exploited to enhance the performance of identifying internal repeats. However, the secondary structures 
possessed conserved and stable structure characteristics during evolution procedures, even the residues 
were evolved and substituted by different contents. Hence, depending on the secondary structure 
characteristics for protein repeats analysis became an important and effective approach.  Here, we 
proposed a novel method based on the predicted secondary structures for detecting unresolved protein 
repeats. There were three major steps for achieving the detection: (1) prediction of the secondary structure 
elements (SSEs) of a query protein from its amino acid sequence; (2) a novel encoded profile named as 
Length Encoded Secondary Structure (LESS) from predicted SSEs within a segment-based representation 
according to the length of SSEs; (3) an autocorrelation mechanism for the identification of repeat locations. 
Conforming to the specifications of these three steps, a system was implemented and called as IRIS: 
Internal Repeat Identification System which utilized a LESS profile and autocorrelation evaluation to 
correctly identify internal repeats within a protein. This proposed system can effectively assist biologists to 
understand the sequence-structure associations of proteins, protein functions, and the evolution past of 
protein structures. 
Methodology 
Data sets 
To demonstrate the proposed method for internal repeat identification, this paper adopted the testing 
protein structures described in the papers published by Andrade, et al.[3] and Abraham, et al.[10]. These 
two papers contained 10 proteins with known internal repeat locations.   
System architecture 
 The system architecture includes four basic modules, SSE prediction, LESS module, smoothing filter, 
and internal repeat detection. The system flow chart was depicted in Figure 2.1. Firstly, users input a query 
protein sequence in FASTA format. An SSE prediction method based on SSPro4 [13] was adopted in this 
report. In the second module, the system executed the LESS transformation to generate a corresponding 
LESS profile from predicted secondary structure information. In the third component, a smooth filtering 
process was performed to tolerate the length variation of LESS profiles due to errors caused by previous 
SSE prediction. For the last module, an autocorrelation process was designed to observe the internal repeat 
relationship from a LESS profile. Finally, the experimental results of detected repeat locations were shown

Internal repeats detection 
 To detect the locations of internal repeats, an autocorrelation mechanism was applied to align the 
LESS profile itself. Before the autocorrelation calculation, a smoothing process for enduring the matching 
tolerance of LESS profile was designed. The major reasons for mis-matchung internal repeats were

Triangular Surface Construction 
Triangulation processes were employed to construct the surface elements of a three-dimensional object. 
The adopted programs, Michel Sanner‟s Molecular Surface (MSMS), in this study were implemented 
especially for molecular surfaces by transforming coordinates into reliable triangular surfaces efficiently. 
The pre-process of the proposed program is to extract coordinates of all C-alpha atoms from a PDB file 
and formulate a corresponding triangular surface by MSMS. The probe radius was set as 2 Å  to roll over 
C-alpha atoms in a protein and other parameters are remained as default settings of MSMS. Accordingly, 
the vertices and the triangular information from the MSMS results are transformed into the Stanford 
Triangle Format for next GD calculation. 
 
Geodesic Distance Calculation 
 GD is defined as the shortest path along the surface from source to destination points. As long as the 
vertices and triangular elements on the surface of a protein are defined, the shortest distance between 
two vertices can be directly calculated. The GD algorithms were done by previously published open 
source program provided by J. S. B. Mitchell, et al. [13]. We adopted the codes to evaluate the GDs 
between all vertex pairs generated by MSMS program. 
 
Reorganization of Geodesic Distances 
After performing GD calculation on all vertex pairs, a rearrangement module is required for organizing 
the GD values of a surface residue according to its local geometrical representation. Due to previous 
MSMS procedures, a single coordinate of an atom could be converted into more than one surface point 
(vertex). In other words, more than one GD values are generated between two practical atoms in general. 
Hence, the GD value between two atoms is defined by taking average of the GD values from all 
associated vertices. The formula is defined as follow:  
36 
 
easily compared correspondingly. Figure 3.3 shows an example of one aligned residue pair (47 H in 
LGV_1 and 47 G in LGV_2) and their surface neighbouring residues. Matched neighbouring residues 
are shown in identical shapes of squares. Based on the matched neighbouring residues for each aligned 
residue pairs, the correlation coefficient between CGAM_1 and CGAM_2 was computed. 
 
Scoring Functions 
The scoring functions can be divided into two different types in the proposed system. Both functions 
multiply a normalized scale, alignScale, to insure that the scores will not be affected by the lengths of 
query and target protein sequences. The formula is shown as the following: 
mLen
alignNum
BAalignScale ),(  
where alignNum is the number of correspondence pairs aligned by local alignment algorithms and mLen 
is the minimum length of query protein A and target protein B. 
 The formula for LGV score is addressed as the following: 
alignScaleLGVCorBALGVS *),(   
where LGVS(A,B) is the final score obtained from the LGV score between proteins A and B, and 
LGVCor is the correlation coefficient of LGVs. 
 The CGAM score is defined as the following: 
alignScale
N
nborScaleCGAMCor
BACGAMS
N
i
i
*
)*(
),(


 
where CGAMS(A,B) is a function of the CGAM matching score between proteins A and B, N is the 
number of residues that possess similar neighbouring relationship, CGAMCor is the correlation 
coefficient for each corresponding residue i. The term nborScale represents the number of matched 
neighbours and it is divided by the minimum length of neighbours for these two similar residues. 
 
Result and Discussion 
To verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed methods, we selected two different types of datasets: 
one is from bound and unbound antigen datasets [14, 15] and the other is from domain swapping dataset 
[16]. All the selected protein pairs possess conformational changes in general. For example, the antigen 
proteins sometimes adjust their conformation to achieve an overall binding or interacting with 
antibodies, while the domain swapping proteins execute swapping mechanism to form a protein 
quaternary structure that a monomer swaps part of its structures and exchanges the swapped portion to 
form an intertwined oligomer. The collected protein pairs from both datasets possess protein surface 
deformation and all of them will be evaluated through profile matching based on featuring the proposed 
local shape descriptors. The selected dataset contains 6 bound/unbound antigen structures (see Table 
3.1), and 30 domain swapping structures (see Table 3.2).

The experiments have shown that the LGV shape descriptor is stable and maintains high 
correlation with deformed conformation despite of opened or closed molecular surfaces. 
Especially, the hinge loop of domain swapping proteins makes 5rsa:A and 1a2w:A cannot be 
aligned well through any structure alignment tool. The difficult condition is that the 
molecular surface tends to be closed due to surface self-connecting, hence the inner distance 
method cannot solve well [8] (see Figure3.4). However, this type of deformation can be 
solved by our proposed LGV descriptors. Figure 3.5 shows a highly correlated coefficient of 
two proteins even if their molecular surfaces were severely deformed.

一、參函會議經過 
 
此次活動的主要目的是參函由國際科技發展組織(International Association of 
Science and Technology Development, IASTED)在英國劍橋大學所舉行的第二屆計算
生物科學國際研討會(International Conference on Computational Bioscience , 
CompBio 2011)，藉著參函此國際專業會議發表由國科會計畫贊助本實驗室所完成的兩
項論文研究成果。兩篇完整會議論文的研究領域皆是與結構生物學的演算法分析及應用
系統開發相關，第一篇是結合構型變化對預測組合性抗原表位之影響，第二篇是形變不
變量之區域描述子用於蛋白質結構表面比對分析，這兩篇論文的研究成果都非常重要，
也有相對的網路系統開發，將後續完成期凼論文投稿到重要期凼。這次 CompBio2011
國際會議是由英國皇家學院(Imperial College) G. Montana教授在 Fitzwilliam 學院

報告內容應包括下列各項： 
一、參加會議經過 
 
此次活動的主要目的是參加由國際科技發展組織(International Association of 
Science and Technology Development, IASTED)在英國劍橋大學所舉行的第二屆計算生物科
學國際研討會(International Conference on Computational Bioscience , CompBio 2011)，
藉著參加此國際專業會議發表由國科會計畫贊助本實驗室所完成的兩項論文研究成果。兩篇
完整會議論文的研究領域皆是與結構生物學的演算法分析及應用系統開發相關，第一篇是結
合構型變化對預測組合性抗原表位之影響，第二篇是形變不變量之區域描述子用於蛋白質結
構表面比對分析，這兩篇論文的研究成果都非常重要，也有相對的網路系統開發，將後續完
成期刊論文投稿到重要期刊。這次 CompBio2011 國際會議是由英國皇家學院(Imperial 
College) G. Montana 教授在 Fitzwilliam 學院主辦此次會議，雖然僅是第二屆的年度會議，
但該會議的論文審查嚴謹，目前在生物資訊的研究領域中具有重要性的國際會議代表之一。
IASTED 今年在劍橋大學與另外兩個知名的國際會議同時舉行，包括第 13 屆智慧型系統與控
制國際會議(Intelligent Systems and Control, ISC 2011)和圖形與虛擬實境國際會議
(Graphics and virtual reality, GRVR 2011)，所有會議論文皆收錄在 IASTED 國際會議論
文集及光碟片。參加此會議的另一個重要任務是本人亦受邀為該會議中一個議程的主持人，
需負責主持一場由五位專家學者報告的議程。此會議除了邀請在結構生物學領域重量級人物
的專題演講外，今年廣邀全世界的研究學者齊聚一堂，討論生物資訊及生物醫學的重要進展
與相關研究成果。除了主持及協助該討論會議的進行之外，在 2A 及 2B的議程中分別由本人
及本人一位博士班學生王信偉同學報告本實驗室所發表的兩篇論文。最難能可貴的是，參加
此次會議可以幸運地與劍橋大學 Blundell教授當面討論，並邀請他在未來可以再次到台灣演
 
表 Y04 
物及生醫資訊及智慧型系統最新的技術與概念外，另一重要目的是希望藉由參與國際會議之
機會推廣海洋大學及本實驗室的研發成果，提昇本國在此研究領域的可見度，經由此次論文
的報告及互動討論，確實也在此次的國際會議發生其效能，也結識多位國際知名學者，也相
信爾後若有機會由台灣接手主辦時，可以期待有更多的國際學者前來參與，甚至可以提升進
行國際合作或學生互訪之機會。 
 
三、考察參觀活動 
 
無。參加研討會與劍橋大學 Blundell教授合照之照片如下 
 
 
四、建議 
 
應鼓勵國內學者及研究人員多參與國際研討會，以利與國外先進討論與學習，除了可以
將各研究室之研發成果推廣外，更可以提昇跨國、跨領域合作計劃之可能性，或爭取國際研
討會活動在台舉辦之機會。除此之外，政府應盡力補助國內舉辦之國際學術活動，提供經費
補助於參加研討會活動行程的國外學生或需要協助之與會者，讓推廣提昇國內研究成果及知
名度之目標得以落實。
