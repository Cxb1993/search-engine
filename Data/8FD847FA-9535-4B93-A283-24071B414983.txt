1tension is neglected in the modeling process of the
small parameter method. The effect of surface tension
was studied by Lin [10], Nakaya [11] and Krishna et al.
[12], who considered it as one of the necessary
condition and treated it in terms of zero-th order terms.
Pumir et al. [13] further included the effect of surface
tension in the film flow model and solved for the
solitary wave solutions. Hwang et al. [14] showed that
the conditions of both supercritical stability and
sub-critical instability are possible to occur for a film
flow system.
Extensive studies on the hydrodynamic stability
problems regarding the fluid films flowing down a
vertical cylinder surface have already investigated by
several researchers. Lin et al. [15] compared their
analytical solutions with the existing experimental
results of falling flow film on a cylinder and creeping
annular flow threads in viscous liquid. Krantz et al. [16]
presented an asymptotic solution and pointed out that
the effect of curvature on the stability of the film flow
is indeed significant. Rosenau et al. [17] derived an
amplitude equation which describes the evolution of a
disturbed free film surface traveling down an infinite
vertical cylindrical column. The numerical modeling
results indicated that both conditions of supercritical
stability and sub-critical instability are possible to occur
for the film flow. Hung et al. [18] investigated the
weakly nonlinear stability analysis of a condensation
film flowing down a vertical cylinder. They also
showed that supercritical stability in the linearly
unstable region and sub-critical instability in the
linearly stable region can co-exist. They also
indicated that the lateral curvature of the cylinder has
the destabilizing effect on the film flow stability. Cheng
et al. [19] studied the nonlinear stability behavior of
thin viscoelastic film flow traveling down along a
vertical cylinder, they found the viscoelastic parameter
k indeed plays a significant role in destabilizing the
flow and is thus of great practical importance.
It was found that the stability problem of practical thin
film flows to the inner or outer surface of a rotating
vertical cylinder, which often appeared in the industrial
coating, painting, lubricating processes, has not been
fully explored so far in literature. These types of
stability problems are indeed of great importance to
many industrial applications. As the centrifugal force is
introduced into the governing equation, the complexity
of mathematical calculation is increased. But the results
are more compatible with the practical situation. The
results of outer cylinder case were published previously
[20]. For the purpose of comparison and better insight
to this problem, the inner cylinder case is investigated
in this study. As the centrifugal force play different role
in these two cases, the results are totally opposite.
2. Mathematical Formulation
Case I: Flowing down on the inner surface
Incompressible viscoelastic fluid employed by Walters
[21] is used for modeling illustrations. The designated
fluid was named as liquid B” by Beard and Walters [22].
The liquid B” of Walters stands for the first-order
approximation of elasticity to the real fluid. In other
words, the liquid B” of Walters can be described as a 
fluid possessing a short or rapidly fading memory that
obeys the constitutive equation of state [23]

In this part, we consider the axisymmetric flow

surface of a rotating vertical cylinder, which starts to
rotate from rest with a constant velocity * . The
appropriate physical configuration is shown
schematically in figure 1. In this case, all associated
physical properties and the rate of film flow are
assumed to be constant (i.e. time-invariant). We use
cylindrical polar coordinate  *** ,, zr  , where r*
denotes the radial direction, * denotes the
circumferential direction, and z* denotes the cylinder
centerline direction. The liquid-air interface is located
at  ***** ,tzhRr  , where R* is the cylinder radius

where the subscripts r, z, rr, zz and rz are used to
represent various partial derivatives of the associated

function, the continuity Equation (4) vanishes. The
equations of motion (5)-(10) simplify to equation (21)
and (22), and the boundary conditions (13)-(15)
become equations (24)-(26.)
Since the modes of long-wavelength that gives the
smallest wave number are most likely to induce flow
instability for the film flow [7,8], the dimensionless
wave number of the long-wavelength mode, , can
then be chosen as the perturbation parameter for
variable expansion. This method is called the long
wave perturbation. By so doing the stream function and
flow pressure can be perturbed and represented as

The flow conditions of the thin film can be
obtained by inserting above expressions into Equations.
(21)-(25) and then solving systematically the resulting
equations. In practice, the non-dimensional surface
tension S is a large value; the term S2 can be
treated as a quantity of zero-th order [18,26]. By
collecting all terms of zero-th order 0 in the

4.1.1 Linear stability analysis
Figure 3(a) shows the neutral stability curves of a
Newtonian (k=0) film flow with various values of the
rotation number. The results indicate that the area of
linearly stable region )0( id enlarges as the rotating
speed increases. Figure 3(b) shows the neutral stability
curves of a viscoelastic (k=0.05) film flow. Comparing
with figure 3(a) and 3(b), the viscoelastic parameter
plays significant role in destabilizing the flow field.

4.1.2 Nonlinear stability analysis
As the perturbed wave grows to finite amplitude,
the linear stability theory is no longer valid for accurate
prediction of flow behavior. The nonlinear stability
analysis is used here to study the effect of finite
amplitude disturbances on the change of stability
behaviors in the linearly stable region. In other words,
we are looking for the behavior of sub-critical
instability in the linearly stable region by using the
nonlinear, instead of linear, flow stability theory. By
using the same nonlinear flow stability theory, one can
also characterize the flow behaviors that subsequent
nonlinear evolution of disturbances in the linearly
unstable region may be redeveloped to a new
equilibrium state of finite amplitudes (i.e. supercritical
stability) or become unstable. The flow instability in
the linearly stable region, named sub-critical instability,
can be easily realized by setting the variable 1E in Eq.
(55) to a negative value. In other words, if 1E in Eq.
(55) is a negative value, the amplitude of disturbed
waves in the linearly stable region is possible to
develop to a unstable state, even though the prediction
obtained by linear analysis always gives stable result.
The nonlinear neutral stability curves can be obtained

Figures 6(a)-6(c) show that the neutral stability curves
of 0id and 01 E are shifted upward as the
values of Ro increase. Therefore, the area of shaded
sub-critical instability region decreases and the area of
shaded supercritical instability region increases as the
values of Ro increase. The area of supercritical stability

5. Concluding remarks
The stability of a thin viscoelastic fluid film
flowing down the inner and outer surface of a rotating
vertical cylinder is thoroughly investigated by using
the method of long wave perturbation. Based on the
results of numerical modeling, conclusions can be
made as following:
Case I: Flowing down on the inner surface
1. The modeling results indicate that the area of
linearly stable region becomes larger for an
increasing Ro and R value. In other words, the
degree of stability is enhanced if the flow is
perturbed by waves with a higher rotation speed,
and a greater radius of the cylinder.
2. In the nonlinear stability analysis, it is noted that the
area of shaded sub-critical instability region and
sub-critical stability region are increased as the
value of Ro and R increase..
Case II: Flowing down on the outer surface
1. In the linear stability analysis, it is noted that the The
