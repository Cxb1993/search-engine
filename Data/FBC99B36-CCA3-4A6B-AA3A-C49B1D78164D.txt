The goal of this subproject is to understand system properties of randomly-deployed 
large-scale wireless sensor networks. The probabilistic analysis focuses on the impacts of various 
transmission radii on network topology. Two topics are studies: (1) the network topology 
depending on node sparse regions, (2) the network topology depending on node dense regions. 
During the past three years, we systematically study related issues for outdoor applications. 
In the first year, based on the results obtained in the project NSC 94-2218-E-009-030, we 
found that scan statistics can provide explanations to various network topology phenomena. 
Therefore, we derived the asymptotics of minimum scan statistics and successfully got hints for 
future researches.  
In the second year, we applied the asymptotics of minimum scan statistics and did many 
quantitative topology analyses for VANETs, including the coverage problems, connectivity 
problems, longest edge problems, and greedy routing problems, etc.. 
In the last year, we derived the asymptotics of maximum scan statistics. Based on the 
asymptotics, we further studied the asymptotic behaviors of the maximum degree, clique number, 
channel assignment algorithms.   
 
Keywords: Wireless sensor network, outdoor application, scan statistics, geometric routing, network 
topology, critical transmission radius, critical sensing radius.

2In wireless communication systems, receivers can decode one signal at a time, so simultaneously arriving
signals are interfered and may cause transmission failure at the receiver. Due to short transmission ranges
of radio frequency signals, interferences are from nearby nodes. For a receiver, nearby nodes are not only
potential message senders but also interference sources. Therefore, the number of nodes in one’s vicinity
is an important topological parameter in a network. In this work, we introduce an analytical tool called
scan statistics that provide an overall upper bound and lower bound of a network for the number of nodes
in one’s vicinity.
Let V be a ﬁnite point set in a bounded region A, and C be a convex compact set 1. Let #(·) be the
cardinality function. C ′ ∼= C means C ′ and C are congruent. In other words, C ′ can be obtained from C
under shifting, rotating, and/or reﬂecting. The maximum scan statistic of V with respect to the scanning
set C is the largest number of nodes that can be covered by a copy of C, i.e. maxC′∼=C #(V ∩ C ′). In
[7], maximum scan statistics are used as a lower bound for the clique number of r-disk graphs. In [8],
Penrose used maximum scan statistics to prove the focusing phenomenon of chromatic numbers. More
applications of scan statistics can be found in [9].
We derive asymptotics of maximum scan statistics for scanning sets with area (β + o (1)) lnn
n
. Based on
the results, we derive asymptotics of the maximum degree and clique number of random geometric graphs.
The ratio of the maximum degree and clique number implies that the chromatic number is almost surely
at most 4 times of the clique number. Furthermore, we prove that the approximation ratios of First-Fit
algorithms in SL, DI, LG, and RD are almost surely upper bounded by 2, 2, 2, and 4, respectively. Our
analysis also implies that the chromatic number is almost surely at most twice of the clique number.
On the other hand, the minimum scan statistic of V with respect to scanning set C is the least number
of points in V covered by a copy of C, i.e. minC′∼=C #(V ∩ C ′). However, without further constraints,
since the copy of C can be placed outside of A, the minimum scan statistic is always 0. To prevent
meaninglessness and for applying to various applications, we may have several variations depending on
supplementary constraints, e.g. (1) C ′ must be fully contained in A; (2) C ′ must have at least half of its
area contained in A; (3) C must be a disk, and the center of C ′ must be in A; (4) A has a boundary-free
topology such as a sphere or a square with toroidal metrics. In this work, we will derive asymptotics for
variations (1), (2), and (3). Note that variation (1) was the case studied by Auer in [10], and variation (4)
has similar asymptotics of variation (1). We derive several explicit asymptotic formulas of minimum scan
statistics in the Erdo˝s-Re´nyi regime with respect to various boundary conditions, and then apply these
results to many network problems.
The rest of this report is organized as follows. In Section II, we deﬁne the notations used in this report
1A set is convex if for any two points u, v in this set, the segment uv is also contained in it. A set is compact if it is bounded and close.
4In topology control of wireless ad hoc networks, geometric structures, such as Gabriel graphs, relative
neighborhood graphs, Yao’s graphs, etc., are fundamental tools for link management and transmission
power (or transmission radius) setting. The largest edge length of geometric structures is a good reference
to the maximal transmission radius, and therefore is an important parameter of the maximal transmission
power in the hardware design stage. For a given geometric structure, the largest edge length is called the
critical transmission radius for this structure.
Geographic greedy routing protocols are interesting due to their advantages in distributed and localized
implementation, but a major drawback is the existence of local minima that may trap packets and
cause deliverability problems. To solve local minimum problems, besides applying complicate remedy
mechanisms to release packets from local minima, we can signiﬁcantly reduce or even eliminate local
minima by increasing the transmission radius. However, to prevent energy waste and signal interferences,
a small transmission radius is preferred. The smallest transmission radius for no existence of local minima
in the network is called the critical transmission radius for geographic greedy routing.
We derive several explicit asymptotic formulas of minimum scan statistics in the Erdo˝s-Re´nyi regime
with respect to various boundary conditions, and then apply these results to many network problems. Our
major contributions include:
• Give an asymptotic formula of sensing radii for Θ(lnn)-coverage.
• Give an asymptotic formula of transmission radii for Θ(lnn)-connectivity.
• Give a threshold of the longest Gabriel graph edge.
• Give a threshold of the longest relative neighborhood graph edge.
• Give a threshold of transmission radii for local-minimum-free greedy forward routing.
• Give a threshold of the grid size for local-minimum-free grid routing.
III. LITERATURE REVIEWS
The determination of the chromatic number is NP-hard even for UDGs. The NP-completeness of the
k-coloring of UDGs was proved for k = 3 by Clark (1990) [12] and for any arbitrary k by Gra¨f et al.
(1998) [13]. Marathe et al. (1995) [14] showed that no polynomial time algorithm for the coloring problem
of UDGs can have performance ratio better than 4/3, unless P = NP . However, the chromatic number
of disk graphs usually can be approximated by their clique number that can be obtained in O
(
|V |3
)
time [12]. Peeters (1991) [15] showed the ratio χ (G) /ω (G) of UDGs is at most 3. In random geometric
graphs, McDiarmid (2003) [7] showed the ratio χ (G) /ω (G) is with high probability equal to 1 in the
sparse case and 2
√
3/π in the dense case. Penrose (2002) [8] even showed that if the random point
process satisﬁes some sparse and regular conditions, the probability distribution of the chromatic number
asymptotically focuses on two consecutive integers.
6IV. RESEARCH APPROACHES
In what follows, the disk of radius r centered at x is denoted by B (x, r). For a, b ∈ R2 and A,B ⊆ R2,
a+ b denotes the addition of two vectors, and A+ b = {a + b : ∀a ∈ A}. ‖x‖ is the Euclidean norm of a
point x ∈ R2. |A| is shorthand for the 2-dimensional area of a measurable set A ⊂ R2. If A is a convex
compact set, mcA denotes the mass center of A. In addition, for a positive real number c, we use cA to
denote the set {mcA + c (x−mcA) : x ∈ A}, i.e. the scaling of A by c w.r.t. the mass center of A. The
diameter of a set A, denoted as diam (A), is the supreme of the distance between any two points in the
set, i.e. diam (A) = supx,y∈A ‖x− y‖. The symbols O,Ω,Θ, o,∼ are deﬁned in Table I and always refer
to the limit n → ∞. An event is said to be asymptotic almost sure (abbreviated by a.a.s.) if it occurs
with a probability converging to one as n → ∞. RV is an acronym of random variable. TABLE I lists
notations used in this report.

A. Maximum Scan Statistics
Let
SM (Vn,Cn) = max
Cn∈Cn
SM (Vn, Cn) .
We have the following theorem.
Theorem 1: For the asymptotics of SM (Vn,Cn), it is almost sure that
Pr
[SM (Vn,Cn)
lnn
∼ L(β)
]
→ 1.
The proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix C. In the proof, we ﬁrst consider Vn is a Poisson point
process. A lower bound for SM (Pn,Cn) (in Lemma 21) and an upper bound for SM (Pn,Cn) (in Lemma
22) are given. Since two bounds are tight, Theorem 1 on Poisson point processes follows. Applying a
de-Poissonization argument, we extend the results to uniform point processes.
B. Minimum Scan Statistics
There are three variations of minimum scan statistics depending on additional constraints on scanning
sets to be studied. To avoid falling in complicated mathematical reasoning, the proofs of Theorem 2, 3,
and 4 are left in Appendix D.
First, we consider the case in which each copy of Cn is fully contained in D. Let
Sm1 (V,C) = min
C′∼=C,C′⊂D
#(V ∩ C ′) , and
Sm1 (Vn,Cn) = min
Cn∈Cn
Sm1 (Vn, Cn) .
10
and
Sm3 (Vn,Cn) = min
Cn∈Cn
Sm3 (Vn, Cn) .
We have the following theorem.
Theorem 4: For the asymptotics of Sm3 (Vn,Cn), we have
1) If D is a unit-area square, it is almost sure that
Pr
[Sm3 (Vn,Cn)
lnn
∼ min
(

→ 1.
2) If D is a unit-area disk, it is almost sure that
Pr
[Sm3 (Vn,Cn)
lnn
∼ 1

L(β)

→ 1.
3) For any β < 1, we almost surely have
Pr [Sm3 (Vn,Cn) = 0] → 1.
The degree of a node is the number of other nodes in the r-disk centered at this node, and the coverage
of a point is the number of nodes in the r-disk centered at this point. Both concepts are related to a disk
with its center in the deployment region, so we apply Theorem 4 to both problems. Details will be given
in Section VI.
V. APPLICATIONS OF MAXIMUM SCAN STATISTICS
A. Asymptotics of Graph Properties
We have the following asymptotic theorem on the clique number and the maximum degree of the
induced network topology.
Theorem 5: Let nπr2n = (β + o (1)) lnn for some constant β > 0. Then,
1) Pr
[
ω(Grn (Vn))

(

)]
→ 1.
2) Pr
[
Δ(Grn(Vn))
lnn
∼ U (β)
]
→ 1.
The proof of Theorem 5 is given in Section V-A1 and V-A2. Before giving the proof, we present a
corollary on the chromatic number.
Corollary 6: Pr
[
1 ≤ χ(Grn (Vn))
ω(Grn (Vn))  4
]
→ 1.
Proof: Since ω (G) ≤ χ (G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1, we have 1 ≤ χ(G)
ω(G)
≤ Δ(G)+1
ω(G)
. Form Theorem 5, we know
that Δ(Grn(Vn))
ω(Grn(Vn)) converges to
U(β)
U(β/4) in probability. The corollary can be proved by showing that (1)
U(β)
U(β/4)
is increasing w.r.t. β; (2) limβ→0
U(β)
U(β/4) = 1; and (3) limβ→∞
U(β)
U(β/4) = 4. Since rest arguments are purely
mathematical, we leave it to readers.

and since those annuli are pairwise disjoint, Y1, · · · , YIn are i.i.d.. Since Δ(Grn (Pn)) ≥ max1≤i≤In Yi,

Applying the de-Poissonization technique introduced in Section C-B, we can obtain the same result on
Xn. Hence, the lemma is proved.
Theorem 5(2) follows Eq. (3) and Lemma (7).
B. Channel Assignment Problems
In wireless ad hoc networks, to avoid transmission collisions, two adjacent nodes in wireless networks
can’t use the same channel. The assignment of channels can be modeled by vertex coloring problems. A
vertex coloring is an assignment of colors to each vertex of graph such that any adjacent vertices receive
different colors. Let Z+ = {1, 2, 3, · · · } represent color set. A vertex coloring g which is a function from
V to Z+ is proper if g (u) = g (v) for any edge (u, v) ∈ E.
1) Graph Inductivities: The inductivity of G, denoted as δ∗ (G), is the largest minimum vertex degree
over all subgraphs of G, i.e.
δ∗ (G) = max
H: subgraph of G
δ (H) ,
and it is known that
χ(G) ≤ δ∗(G) + 1.
14
number of channels used is upper bounded by the inductivity of the ordering plus 1, i.e. δh(G) + 1. In
[11], four vertex orderings were discussed:
1) Smallest-last ordering (SL): The vertices are greedily selected in reverse order. Each time, a vertex
with the smallest degree in the remaining induced subgraph is selected and removed. This vertex
ordering has the least inductivity, i.e. indSL (G) = δ∗ (G). [25]
2) Distance-increasing ordering (DI): The vertices are sorted in the increasing order of their Euclidean
distances from an arbitrary ﬁxed point.
3) Lexicographic ordering (LG): The vertices are sorted in the lexicographic order of their coordinates.
4) Radius-decreasing ordering (RD): The vertices are sorted in the decreasing order of their transmission
radii. If all nodes have the same transmission radii, the ordering is random.
For any vertex set V and transmission radius r, the approximation ratios of indSL (Gr (V )),
indDI (Gr (V )), indLG (Gr (V )), and indRD (Gr (V )) to χ (Gr (V )) respectively are 3, 3, 3, and 5. [11]
For any vertex ordering g, we have
ω (Gr (V )) ≤ χ (Gr (V )) ≤ indg (Gr (V )) + 1 ≤ Δ(Gr (V )) + 1.
Hence, form Theorem 5, it is a.a.s. that indg(Grn (Vn))
ω(Grn(Vn))  4. In addition, since indSL (Grn (Vn)) =
δ∗ (Grn (Vn)), from Theorem 8, it is a.a.s. that indSL(Grn(Vn))ω(Grn(Vn))  2. Moreover, applying the argument
used in Theorem 8 to the vertex ordering DI and LG, we can prove that it is a.a.s. that indDI(Grn(Vn))
ω(Grn(Vn))  2
and indLG(Grn (Vn))
ω(Grn (Vn))  2. Therefore, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 9: It is asymptotically almost sure that the approximation ratio of any FIRST-FIT algorithm
is at most 4. Furthermore, it is asymptotically almost sure that the approximation ratios of FIRST-FIT in
SL, DI, LG are at most 2. Furthermore, the chromatic number is a.a.s. at most twice of the clique number.
VI. TOPOLOGY EVOLUTION OF WIRELESS AD HOC AND SENSOR NETWORKS
Minimum scan statistics have a wide range of applications in the research of wireless ad hoc and
sensor networks. For example, coverage of wireless sensor networks can be approximated by minimum
scan statistics. A sensor system is said to k-cover the deployment region if every point in the deployment
region can be monitored by at least k sensors. Here k is an application-dependent QoS requirement. For
instance, in an object tracking system applying triangulation methods, at least three sensors are needed
to decide the location of an object. Thus, 3-coverage is a requirement of such a system. Assume each
sensor can monitor the area within distance r, i.e., an object at x can be detected by sensor u if x is in
16
Now, consider β < 1. According to Theorem 1.2 in [17] and Theorem 9 in [26], it is a.a.s. that
δ (Grn (Vn)) = 0. Hence, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 10: Assume rn = (β + o (1))
√
lnn
πn
for some constant β > 0. We have
Pr
[
δ (Grn (Vn))
lnn
∼ Sm3 (Vn, B (o, rn))
lnn
]
→ 1.
It is known that a random geometric graph is a.a.s. k-connected if its minimum degree is k [2].
Therefore, the connectivity of wireless networks also can be estimated by Sm3. In addition, if β > 1,
Grn (Vn) is a.a.s. Θ(lnn)-connected; and if β < 1, Grn (Vn) is a.a.s. disconnected. Therefore, β = 1 is
the threshold for connectivity.
B. The Longest Edges of Geometric Structures
Geometric structures such as Euclidean minimal spanning trees, relative neighborhood graphs (RNGs)
[27], Gabriel graphs (GGs) [28], Yao’s graphs, and Delauney triangulations are widely used in topology
control of wireless ad hoc networks [29] [30] [31]. The largest edge lengths of these structures are good
references to the conﬁguration of the maximal transmission radius.
1) Gabriel Graphs: Two nodes u, v have a Gabriel edge between them whenever the disk with segment
uv as a diameter contains no other nodes. In addition, since u, v is in D, the disk has at least half of its
area in D. Let ρGG (V ) denote the largest edge length of the GG over V . According to Theorem 3, a disk
with diameter larger then (1 + ε) 2
√
lnn
πn
for some positive constant ε almost surely contains some nodes.
This implies
ρGG (Pn) ≤ (1 + ε) 2
√
lnn
πn
.
It was further proved in [32] that for any constant ε > 0,
lim
n→∞Pr
⎡
⎣1− ε ≤ ρGG (Pn)
2
√
lnn
πn
≤ 1 + ε
⎤
⎦ = 1.
So, β = 2 is the threshold of the longest GG edge.
2) Relative Neighborhood Graphs: If u and v are two nodes, let Luv denote the lens of B (u, ‖u− v‖)∩
B (v, ‖u− v‖). The segment uv is called the waist of Luv. We have |Luv| = π
(‖u−v‖
β0
)2
. In RNGs, two
nodes u, v have an edge between them if and only if there are no other nodes in Luv. Let ρRNG (V )
denote the largest edge length of the RNG over V . According to Theorem 3, any lens whose waist length
is larger than (1 + ε) β0
√
lnn
πn
for some positive constant ε a.a.s. is not empty. This implies
ρRNG (Pn) ≤ (1 + ε) β0
√
lnn
πn
.
Furthermore, the following theorem can be proved.
18
Let l denote the size (edge length) of a cell. Then,
√
5l is the transmission radius such that two nodes in
neighboring cells can communicate with each other.
A node is a local minimum (w.r.t. a given destination node) if there do not exist neighbors in neighboring
cells that are closer to the destination cell. If the transmission radius is at least
√
5l and every cell contains
at least one node, the network is local-minimum-free. Let Nn =
⌈
1
β
√
n
lnn
⌉
for some constant β and ln = 1Nn .
Tessellate the deployment region D into N2n square cells with length ln. According to Theorem 2, if β > 1,
every cell contains at least one node. Hence, if rn ≥
√
5ln, the network is a.a.s. local-minium-free. We
have the following theorem.
Theorem 12: Let ln = (β + o (1))
√
lnn
n
for some β > 0 and rn =
√
5ln. If β > 1, the network is a.a.s.
local-minimum-free.
D. Evolution of Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
For a set of homogeneous wireless devices, by setting transmission radii large enough, the underlying
network topology can have desired properties. However, the maximal transmission radius is speciﬁed by
the hardware. Hence, threshold information are important in the design of wireless systems in order to fully
utilize hardware limitations. In this section, we have obtained the thresholds of several network properties.
By lining up those thresholds in increasing order, we can see the evolution of network topology. Let βQ
denote the threshold for property Q. Currently, we have βCon = βCov = 1, βRNG = βGFR = β0 ≈ 1.6,
and βGG = 2.
Although βCon = βCov, for a connected wireless sensor network, the sensing radius is usually set to 2
times of the transmission radius in order to guarantee the coverage. Similarly, although βRNG = βGFR,
there exist some inherent differences between the longest RNG edge problem and the local-minimum-free
GFR problem. Actually, for the same set of nodes, the critical transmission radius for RNG is no more
than the critical transmission radius for GFR. Those differences can not be distinguished in the resolution
of order lnn. As a future work, it is worth to study those problems under a ﬁner resolution. Especially,
we are interested in the transition at each threshold. For example, for a properties Q, we may consider
the radius given in the form of rn = βQ
√
lnn+ξ
nπ
or even rn = βQ
√
lnn+c ln lnn+ξ
nπ
.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
Channel assignment is an essential problem for wireless networks and is NP-hard. We assume
homogeneous wireless ad hoc networks are modeled by r-disk graphs over random point processes
with mean density n. First, we introduce an analytic tool called maximum scan statistics and show that
maximum scan statistics of Poisson point processes or uniform point processes with respect to regular
scanning sets of area (β + o (1)) lnn
n
can be asymptotically approximated by U (β) lnn. Next, consider

n! ∼ (2πn) 12nne−n. (5)

for any μ > 1, as λ →∞, the upper tail distribution of a Poisson RV can be estimated by

for any μ ∈ (0, 1), as λ →∞, the lower tail distribution of a Poisson RV can be given by

From Eq. (5) and (6), we have the following lemma.

Pr (Po (λ) ≥ μλ) ∼
√

Thus, the lemma is proved.

, then
Pr

Thus, maxIni=1 Yi < μλn a.a.s..
Next assume that Yi’s are i.i.d. Poisson RVs with mean λn. Then,
Pr
[

Fix 1 < μ < φ−1+ (1/β). Then 1− βφ (μ) > 0 and
1− (λn/ lnn)φ (μ) → 1− βφ (μ) > 0.
If In = Ω
(

)
, then
In Pr [Y ≥ μλ] →∞.
Hence,
Pr
[
In
max

]
→ 1.
Thus, maxIni=1 Yi ≥ μλn a.a.s..
We have the following corollary on the maximum of a collection of Poisson RVs.
Corollary 16: Assume that limn→∞ λnlnn = β for some constant β > 0. Let Y1, Y2, · · · , YIn be In Poisson
RVs with means λn.
1) If In = o
(
n

)
, then for any β′ ∈ (0, β), maxi=1,··· ,In Yi < U (β′) lnn a.a.s..
2) If Y1, Y2, · · · , YIn are independent and In = Ω
(
n
lnn
)
, then for any β′ ∈ (β,∞), maxi=1,··· ,In Yi ≥
U (β′) lnn a.a.s..
Proof: From Lemma 15(1), if In = o
(
n
√
lnn
)
, for any given β′ ∈ (β,∞), choose a μ ∈(
1, U(β

U(β) φ

]
. Then, it is a.a.s. that

≤ U (β′) lnn.
Similarly, from Lemma 15(2), if In = Ω
(
n
lnn
)
and Y1, Y2, · · · , YIn are independent and with mean λn,
then for any β′ ∈ (0, β), it is a.a.s. that maxIni=1 Yi ≥ U (β′) lnn.
The next lemma gives a.a.s. bounds for the minimum of a collection of Poisson RVs.
24
and
1/2− (λn/ lnn)φ (μ) → 1/2− βφ (μ) < 0.
Thus,
Pr
[
In
min
i=1
Yi ≤ μλn
]
= o (1) ,
So, Lemma 17(2) is proved.
Now, assume Yi’s are independent. Then,
Pr
[
In
min
i=1
Yi ≤ μλn
]
= 1− Pr
[
In
min

If In = Ω

In Pr [Y ≤ μλn]

For any μ such that either (a) φ−1− (1/β) < μ < 1 if β > 1, or (b) 0 < μ < 1 if β = 1, since
1− (λn/ lnn)φ (μ) → 1− βφ (μ) > 0, we have
In Pr [Y ≥ μλ] →∞.
In addition, if β < 1 and μ = 0,
In Pr [Y ≤ μλ] = In Pr [Y = 0]
= Ω
(
n
lnn
)
e−β lnn →∞
So,
Pr
[
In

]
→ 1.
Thus, Lemma 17(3) is proved.
Assume Yi’s are independent and In = Ω

)
. Similarly, for any μ such that (a) φ−1−

if β > 1
2
, (b) 0 < μ < 1 if β = 1
2
, or (c) μ = 0 if β < 1
2

In Pr [Y ≤ μλn] →∞,
and
Pr

26
So, Lemma 18(3) is proved.
Finally, consider the last case in which Y1, Y2, · · · , YIn are independent and In = Ω

So, Lemma 18(4) is proved.

GEOMETRIC PRELIMINARIES
A. Partition of Deployment Regions
If D is a unit-area square, it is partitioned into Dr (0), Dr (1) and Dr (2) according to r. Dr (0) consists
of all points in D apart from ∂D by at least r, Dr (1) consists of all points in D apart from some side of
D by less than r and from all other sides by at least r, and Dr (2) consists of the rest points in D. See

If D is a unit-area disk, it is partitioned into Dr (0) and Dr (1) according to r. Dr (0) = B

)
is a disk consisting of all points in D apart from ∂D by at least r, and Dr (1) = D \Dr (0) is an annulus
centered at o with radii 1√

. See Fig. 6.
B. Isodiametric Inequalities
Assume C ⊂ R2 is a convex compact set. The r-neighborhood of C, denoted as Cr, is the union of
all r-disks with centers in C, i.e. Cr =
⋃
x∈C B (x, r), and C−r denotes the set of points of C that are
apart from ∂C by at least r. diam (C) denotes the diameter of C that is the supreme of the distance
between any two points in C, i.e. diam (C) = supx,y∈C ‖x− y‖; and peri (C) denotes the perimeter of
C. According to the isodiametric inequality [22]–[24] , a disk with diameter d not only has the largest
28
C. Tessellations
An ε-tessellation divides the plane by vertical and horizontal lines into equal-size square cells with
width ε. Without loss of generality, we assume the origin is at a corner of cells. In a given tessellation,
a polyquadrate is a collection of cells intersecting with a convex compact set. For example, in Fig. 8,
the shaded cells form a polyquadrate induced by a polygon. The horizontal span of a polyquadrate is the
Fig. 8. The cells intersecting with the polygon form a polyquadrate.
horizontal distance measured in the number of cells from left to right. The vertical span of a polyquadrate
is deﬁned similarly but in the vertical direction. In an ε-tessellation, if the diameter of a polygon is d, the
span of an induced polyquadrate in an ε-tessellation is at most d/ε+ 1. The following lemma is from
[34].
Lemma 20: Let S be a region composed of m cells. For a positive constant integer τ , the number of
polyquadrates with span at most τ and intersecting with S is Θ(m).
Proof: For a speciﬁed cell, since τ is a constant, the number of polyquadrates that contain the cell and
have span at most τ is also a constant (depending on τ ). For each cell in S, the number of polyquadrates
that contain the cell and have span at most τ is Θ(1). Since there are m cells in S, the total number of
polyquadrates with span at most τ and intersecting with S is Θ(m).
APPENDIX C
PROOFS OF THEOREM 1
To prove Theorem 1, we ﬁrst consider Vn is a Poisson point process. In Section C-A, a lower bound
for SM (Pn,Cn) (in Lemma 21) and an upper bound for SM (Pn,Cn) (in Lemma 22) are given. Since
two bounds are tight, Theorem 1 on Poisson point processes follows. In Section C-B, applying a de-
Poissonization argument, we extend the results to uniform point processes.
30
B. De-Poissonization for Maximum Scan Statistics
Here we introduce a de-Poissonization technique that allow us to extend results on Poisson point
processes to uniform point processes. By Chebyshev inequality, it is almost sure that Po

n− n 34
)
≤ n ≤
Po

. Thus,

For |Cn| = (β + o (1)) lnnn , we have(

∼ SM (Pn, Cn) . (11)
From Eq. (10) and (11), we have
SM (Pn, Cn) ∼ SM (Xn, Cn) .
APPENDIX D
PROOFS OF THEOREM 2, 3, AND 4
First, we focus only on Poisson point processes. So, in Section D-A, D-B, and D-C, all lemmas are on
Pn. Then, applying a de-Poissonization technique given in Section D-D, we can extend results to uniform
point processes.
A. Proof of Theorem 2
Lemma 23: For any constant β′ ∈ (β,∞), it is almost sure that
Pr [Sm1 (Pn,Cn) ≤ L(β′) lnn] → 1.
Especially, if β < 1, we almost surely have
Pr [Sm1 (Vn,Cn) = 0] → 1.
Proof: For any Cn ∈ Cn, let In be the number of copies of Cn that can be packed into D, and Yi
denote the number of nodes in the i-th copy of Cn. Then, Y1, Y2, · · · , YIn are i.i.d. Poisson RVs with rate
β lnn, and Sm1 (Vn,Cn) ≤ min1≤i≤In Yi. We can tile Θ
(
n
lnn
)
squares with edge length c0
√
|Cn| in D, and
then place one copy of Cn in each square. These copies of Cn are pairwise disjoint. Thus, In = Ω
(
n
lnn
)
.
By Lemma 18(3), we have
Sm1 (Pn,Cn) ≤ min
1≤i≤In
Yi ≤ L (β′) lnn.
32
B. Proof of Theorem 3
Lemma 25: For any constant β′ ∈ (β,∞), we have
Pr
[
Sm2 (Pn,Cn) ≤ 1
2
L (β′) lnn
]
→ 1.
Especially, if β < 1, it is almost sure that
Pr [Sm2 (Pn,Cn) = 0] → 1.
Proof: For any Cn ∈ Cn, place pairwise disjoint copies of Cn along the boundary of D such that
each of them has exactly one half area in D. Let In be the number of copies of Cn, and Yi denote the
number of nodes in the i-th copy. Then, Y1, Y2, · · · , YIn are i.i.d. Poisson RVs with rate
(
1
2
β + o (1)
)
lnn.
Since diam (Cn) = Θ
(√
lnn
n
)
for any Cn ∈ Cn, we may have In = Θ
(√
n
lnn
)
. From Lemma 18(4), we
have
Sm2 (Pn,Cn) ≤ min
1≤i≤In
Yi ≤ 1
2
L (β′) lnn.
Furthermore, if β < 1, we may choose a β′ ∈ (β, 1), and then Sm2 (Pn,Cn) = 0 is a.a.s. implied. So, the
lemma is proved.
Lemma 26: For any constant 0 < β′ < β, we have
Pr
[
Sm2 (Pn,Cn) > 1
2
L (β′) lnn
]
→ 1.
Proof: We will apply a similar argument used in the proof of Lemma 24. Let rn be the inferior of
the (smallest) distance from the mass center of Cn to ∂Cn over all Cn ∈ Cn, and εn = 12√2
(
1−
√
β′
β
)
rn.
We have rn = Θ
(√
lnn
n
)
and εn = Θ
(√
lnn
n
)
. Divide D by an εn-tessellation. Obviously, the distance
between any two points in a cell is at most
√
2εn. Consider the collection of polyquadrates each of which
is the maximal one contained in the intersection of D and a copy of Cn with at least half area in D. Let
In denote the number of those polyquadrates, and Yi denote the number of nodes in the i-th polyquadrate.
Then,
Sm2 (Pn,Cn) ≥ min
1≤i≤In
Yi.
Y1, Y2, · · · , YIn are categorized into two groups. First, we consider polyquadrates that are contained in
copies of Cn fully contained in D. All these polyquadrates are with span at most m =
⌈
diam(Cn)
εn
⌉
+ 1 =
Θ(1) and with area at least (β′ + o (1)) lnn
n
. Let I0,n denote the number of polyquadrates, and Y0,i denote
the number of nodes in the i-th polyquadrate. All Y0,i’s are Poisson RVs with rate at least (β′ + o (1)) lnn.
From Lemma 20, I0,n = Θ
(
1
ε2n
)
= Θ
(
n
lnn
)
. Applying Lemma 18(1), it is a.a.s. that
I0,n
min
i=1
Y0,i ≥ L (β′) lnn.
34
Therefore, the lemma is proved.
Lemma 28: For any constant 0 < β′ < β, if D is a square, we almost surely have
Pr
[
Sm3 (Pn,Cn) ≥ min
(
1
2
L(β′), 1
4
β′
)
lnn
]
→ 1;
if D is a disk, we almost surely have
Pr
[
Sm3 (Pn,Cn) ≥ 1
2
L(β′) lnn
]
→ 1.
Proof: Choose a β1 ∈ (β′, β). Let r and r′ be given by nπr2 = β lnn and nπr′2 = β1 lnn,
respectively. Let Mn =
√
2
r−r′ and εn = 1/Mn. Divide D by an εn-tessellation, and then for each cell,
draw a r′-disk with its center in the intersection of this cell and D. Since the distance between any two
points in a cell is at most
√
2εn = r − r′, any r-disk with center in D must contain at least one of these
r′-disks. Let In denote the number of these r′-disks, and Yi denote the number of nodes in the i-th r′-disk.
Then,
Sm3 (Pn,Cn) ≥ min
1≤i≤In
Yi.
If D is a square, we partition Y1, Y2, · · · , YIn into three groups. First, we consider cells contained in
D (0), and let N0 denote the number of cells. For these cells, we have Yi = Po (β1 lnn) and
N0 ∼
⎛
⎝1− 2r
r−r′√
2
⎞
⎠
2
=
⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠
2
= Θ
(
n
lnn
)
.
From Lemma 18(1), it is a.a.s. that
min
1≤i≤N0
Yi ≥ L (β′) lnn.
Next, we consider cells intersecting with D (1) but not with D (2), and let N1 denote the number of cells.
For these cells, we have Yi ≥ Po
(
1
2
β1 lnn
)
and
N1 ∼ r (1− 2r)(
r−r′√
2
)2 = 2 (1− 2r)
r
(
1− r′
r
)2 = Θ
(√
n
lnn
)
.
From Lemma 18(2), it is a.a.s. that
min
1≤i≤N1
Yi ≥ 1
2
L (β′) lnn.
Last, we consider cells intersecting with D (2), and let N2 denote the number of cells. For these cells, we
have Yi ≥ Po
(
1
4
β1 lnn
)
and
N2 <

r

)2

Then, it is a.a.s. that

Yi ≥ 1

A Unified Analytic Framework Based on
Minimum Scan Statistics for Wireless
Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks
Chih-Wei Yi, Member, IEEE
Abstract—Due to limitations on transmission power of wireless devices, areas with sparse nodes are decisive to some extreme
properties of network topology. In this paper, we assume wireless ad hoc and sensor networks are represented by uniform point
processes or Poisson point processes. Asymptotic analyses based on minimum scan statistics are given for some crucial network
properties, including coverage of wireless sensor networks, connectivity of wireless ad hoc networks, the largest edge length of
geometric structures, and local-minimum-free geographic routing protocols. We derive explicit formulas of minimum scan statistics. By
taking the transmission radius as a major parameter, our results are applied to various network problems. This work offers a unified
approach to solve various problems and reveals the evolution of network topology. In addition, boundary effects are thoroughly handled.

1 INTRODUCTION
IN homogeneous wireless ad hoc networks, all wirelessdevices have the same transmission radius r, and two
nodes have a link between them if they are apart from each
other no more than r. A communication session is
established either through a single-hop radio transmission
if the communication parties are within each other’s
transmission range, or through relaying by intermediate
devices otherwise. The induced network topology is called
r-disk graphs, or unit disk graphs (UDGs) if r is scaled to 1.
An r-disk graph over a vertex set V is denoted by GrðV Þ.
Because of no need for fixed infrastructures, wireless ad hoc
networks can be flexibly deployed at low cost for various
missions such as decision making in the battlefield,
emergency disaster relief, and environmental monitoring.
In many applications, such as wireless sensor networks, a
large number of devices need to be deployed in harsh
environments. As a result, deterministic deployment
usually is not feasible, and random deployment is the only
viable solution. Hence, it is natural to model wireless
networks by r-disk graphs over random point sets, and
asymptotic analyses are interesting to the research commu-
nity [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
In wireless communication systems, receivers can de-
code one signal at a time, so simultaneously arriving signals
are interfered and may cause transmission failure at the
receiver. Due to short transmission ranges of radio
frequency signals, interferences are from nearby nodes.
Therefore, for a receiver, nearby nodes are not only
potential message senders but also interference sources.
Therefore, the number of nodes in one’s vicinity is an
important topological parameter in a network. In this paper,
we introduce an analytical tool called minimum scan
statistics that provide an overall lower bound of a network
for the number of nodes in one’s vicinity.
Let V be a finite point set in a bounded region A, and
C be a convex compact set.1 Let #ðÞ be the cardinality
function. We say C0 is a copy of C, denoted by C0 ﬃ C, if
C0 is obtained from C by reflecting, rotating, and/or
shifting. The minimum scan statistic of V with respect to
scanning set C is the least number of points in V covered
by a copy of C, i.e., minC0ﬃC #ðV \ C0Þ. However, without
further constraints, since the copy of C can be placed
outside of A, the minimum scan statistic is always 0. To
prevent meaninglessness and for applying to various
applications, we may have several variations depending
on supplementary constraints, e.g.
1. C0 must be fully contained in A.
2. C0 must have at least half of its area contained in A.
3. C must be a disk, and the center of C0 must be in A.
4. A has a boundary-free topology such as a sphere or a
square with toroidal metrics.
In this paper, we will derive asymptotics for variations 1, 2,
and 3. Note that variation 1 was the case studied by Auer
and Hornik [6], and variation 4 has similar asymptotics of
variation 1.
In literature, most works on scan statistics studied the
largest number of points covered by scanning sets. To

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2,
we define the notations used in this paper and give a useful
probabilistic lemma. In Section 3, we give asymptotics of
minimum scan statistics. In Section 4, minimum scan
statistics are applied to several problems raised in wireless
ad hoc and sensor networks. Our conclusions are provided
in Section 5. Some complicated mathematical proofs are left
in the Appendix.
2 PRELIMINARIES AND TERMINOLOGIES
In what follows, the disk of radius r centered at x is denoted
by Bðx; rÞ. For a, b 2 IR2 and A, B  IR2, aþ b denotes the
addition of two vectors, and Aþ b ¼ faþ b : 8a 2 Ag. kxk is
the euclidean norm of a point x 2 IR2. jAj is shorthand for
the 2D area of a measurable set A  IR2. If A is a convex
compact set, mcA denotes the mass center of A. In addition,
for a positive real number c, we use cA to denote the set
fmcA þ cðxmcAÞ : x 2 Ag. The diameter of a set A,
denoted as diamðAÞ, is the supreme of the distance between
any two points in the set, i.e., diamðAÞ ¼ supx;y2A kx yk.
The symbols O, , , o, and 	 are defined in Table 1 and
always refer to the limit n!1. An event is said to be
asymptotic almost sure (a.a.s.) if it occurs with a probability
converging to one as n!1. RV is an acronym of random
variable. Table 1 lists notations used in this paper.
Let  be the function over ð0;1Þ defined by
ðÞ ¼ 1 þ  ln. A straightforward calculation yields
0ðÞ ¼ ln and 00ðÞ ¼ 1=. Thus,  is strictly convex and
has the unique minimum zero at  ¼ 1 (see Fig. 1). Let 1 :
½0; 1Þ ! ð0; 1 be the inverse of the restriction of  to (0, 1].
We are interested in the equation  ¼ 1 ð1=Þ, and the
graph of  ¼ 1 ð1=Þ is depicted in Fig. 2. Define a
function L over ð0;1Þ by
LðÞ ¼ 

0; otherwise:

L is a monotonic increasing function of . The curve of LðÞ
is illustrated in Fig. 3.
The following lemma is related to the minimum of a
collection of Poisson RVs.

Hence, under this sensingmodel, coverage and theminimum
scan statistic in some sense are the same, and we can use
Theorem 4 to approximate the coverage of sensor networks.
Especially, if  > 1, ID is a.a.s. ðlnnÞ-covered, and if  < 1,
there a.a.s. exists uncovered area. Hence,  ¼ 1 is the
threshold for sensing coverage. Note that although the
boundary effects are not explicitly considered here, they are
implicitly handled by the definition of Sm3.

4.1 The Minimum Degree and Connectivity
The minimum degree of a graph G, denoted by 	ðGÞ, is the
minimum nodal degree over all nodes. In r-disk graphs, the
degree of node u is the number of nodes in Bðu; rÞ minus 1.
Hence,

u2Vn
degðuÞ
¼ min

# Vn \Bðu; rnÞð Þ  1
Sm3 Vn; Bðo; rnÞð Þ  1:
If we can further prove that 	ðGrnðVnÞÞ is asymptotically
upper bounded by Sm3ðVn; Bðo; ð1þ "ÞrnÞÞ for any given
" > 0, then 	ðGrnðVnÞÞ can be approximated by
Sm3ðVn; Bðo; rÞÞ.
First, consider   1. By Theorem 4, for a given " > 0,
there a.a.s. exists a ð1þ "Þrn-disk with center in ID covering
Sm3ðVn; Bðo; ð1þ "ÞrnÞÞ nodes. Draw a concentric "rn-disk
of this ð1þ "Þrn-disk. The number of nodes in the "rn-disk is
a binomial RV, and it is a.a.s. that at least one node is in the
"rn-disk. For those nodes in the "rn-disk, their nodal
degrees are less than the number of nodes in the
ð1þ "Þrn-disk, i.e., Sm3ðVn; Bðo; ð1þ "ÞrnÞÞ. So, for any  
1 and " > 0, it is a.a.s. that
	 GrnðVnÞð Þ 
 Sm3 Vn; B o; ð1þ "Þrnð Þð Þ:
Now, consider  < 1. According to [10, Theorem 1.2] and
[15, Theorem 9], it is a.a.s. that 	ðGrnðVnÞÞ ¼ 0. Hence, we
have the following theorem.

! 1:
It is known that a random geometric graph is a.a.s. k-
connected if its minimum degree is k [2]. Therefore, the
connectivity of wireless networks can also be estimated by Sm3.
In addition, if  > 1, GrnðVnÞ is a.a.s. ðlnnÞ-connected; and
if  < 1, GrnðVnÞ is a.a.s. disconnected. Therefore,  ¼ 1 is the
threshold for connectivity.
4.2 The Longest Edges of Geometric Structures
Geometric structures such as euclidean minimal spanning
trees, RNGs [16], GGs [17], Yao’s graphs, and Delauney
triangulations are widely used in topology control of
wireless ad hoc networks [18], [19], [20]. The largest edge
lengths of these structures are good references to the
configuration of the maximal transmission radius.
4.2.1 Gabriel Graphs
Two nodes u, v have a Gabriel edge between them
whenever the disk with segment uv as a diameter contains
no other nodes. In addition, since u, v is in ID, the disk has at
least half of its area in ID. Let 
GGðV Þ denote the largest edge
length of the GG over V . According to Theorem 3, a disk
with diameter larger than ð1þ "Þ2

resolution of ðlnnÞ, but as pointed out in Section 4.4, it is
necessary to study related problems in finer resolutions.
Second, disk models are idealized but not realistic. We
should relax our assumptions and consider more general-
ized channel models. Third, the works given in this paper
are purely analytical. We ought to consider related issues
from application perspectives. The impact of imprecise
location information should also be carefully evaluated.

neighborhood of C, denoted as Cr, is the union of all r-disks
with centers in C, i.e., Cr ¼
S
x2C Bðx; rÞ. We use Cr to
denote the set of points of C that are apart from @C by at
least r and use periðCÞ to denote the perimeter of C.
According to the isodiametric inequality [23], [24], [25], the
disk of diameter d has the largest area 14d
2 over all
measurable sets with diameter d and also has the longest
perimeter d over all convex compact sets with diameter d.
Lemma 10. Suppose that C  IR2 is a convex compact set with
diameter at most d. We have
jCt  Cj < dtþ t2 and jCtj  jCj  dt:
Proof.We will explicitly prove the inequalities for C being a
polygon. If C is a convex compact set, the lemma can be
proved by applying the fact that C can be approximated
by a sequence of polygons contained in C. Thus, we
assume C is a polygon.
First, we prove jCt  Cj < dtþ t2. At each vertex of
C, draw two perpendicular lines to the edges of C. The
area Ct  C is divided into disjoint rectangles and sectors
(see Fig. 6). All rectangles are with the same width t, and
the sum of their length is equal to the perimeter of C. All
sectors (marked by x in Fig. 6) are with radius t, and
since the angle of each sector is supplementary to its
interior angle, the sum of their angles is equal to 2. Let l
denote the perimeter of C, then jCt  Cj ¼ ltþ t2. For
diamðCÞ 
 d, we have l < d [25]. So, the inequality
follows.
Now, we prove jCtj  jCj  dt. For each edge of C,
draw a rectangle by it with width t toward the inner of C.
Since C  Ct is fully covered by these rectangles, we
have jCtj  jCj  periðCÞt. For all compact sets with
diameter d, we have periðCÞ < d. Thus, jCrj  jCj 
dt is proved. tu
B.3 Tessellations
A "-tessellation divides the plane by vertical and horizontal
lines into a grid in which each grid cell has width ". Without
loss of generality, we assume the origin is a corner of some
cells. In a tessellation, a polyquadrate is a collection of cells
intersecting with a convex compact set. For example, in
Fig. 7, the shaded cells form a polyquadrate induced by a
polygon. The horizontal span of a polyquadrate is the
horizontal distance measured in the number of cells from
the left to the right. The vertical span of a polyquadrate is
defined similarly but in the vertical direction. If the
diameter of a polygon is d, the span of the corresponding
polyquadrate in a "-tessellation is at most dd"e þ 1.
Lemma 11. Let S be a region composed of m cells. For a positive
constant integer  , the number of polyquadrates with span at
most  and intersecting with S is ðmÞ.
Proof. For a specified cell, since  is a constant, the number
of polyquadrates that contain the cell and have span at
most  is also a constant (depending on ). For each cell
in S, the number of polyquadrates that contain the cell
and have span at most  is ð1Þ. Since there arem cells in
S, the total number of polyquadrates with span at most 
and intersecting with S is ðmÞ. tu

toward v can be expressed as minwi∈B(v,‖u−v‖) ‖wi − u‖. For
a given point set V in the plane, let
ρ (V ) = max
(u,v)∈V 2
u=v
(
min
w∈B(v,‖u−v‖)∩V
‖w − u‖
)
. (1)
It is the the maximum of minw∈B(v,‖u−v‖)∩V ‖w − u‖ over
all (u, v) pairs of nodes.
To eliminate local minima in the network, we choose
ρ (V ) as the transmission radius. According to the previous
discussion, any node u always can deliver packets toward
any other node. However, is ρ (V ) the optimal (smallest)
transmission radius for local-minimum-free? The answer is
positive. Consider the pair of nodes (u, v) that gives the value
ρ (V ). If the transmission radius is set less than ρ (V ), u
can’t directly send packets to v and there is no other node
that can relay packets for u toward v. So, u is a local
minimum w.r.t. v. So, ρ (V ) is the optimal one and called
the critical transmission radius for (local-minimum-free) GFR
that guarantees the deliverability of packets. In the rest of
this paper, the critical transmission radius for GFR is simply
written as the critical transmission radius and abbreviated as
CTR.
The analytic work of GFR can be dated back to 1984 by
Takagi and Kleinrock [1]. They studied the optimal trans-
mission radius to maximize the expected progress of packets
based on most forward and least backward routing strategy
in which every node delivers each packet to the neighbor (not
including itself) with the shortest projected distance to the des-
tination on the straight line joining the current node. However,
the deliverability of packets is not considered. Recently, Xing
et al. [2] (2004) show that in a fully covered homogeneous
wireless sensor network, if the transmission radius is larger
than 2 times of the sensing radius, the deliverability can
be guaranteed between any source-destination pair by greedy
forwarding schemes in which a packet is sent to the neighbor
either with the shortest Euclidean distance to the destination
[4] [5] or with the shortest projected distance to the destination
on the straight line joining the current node and the destination
node [1] and by bounded Voronoi greedy forwarding scheme
in which only those nodes whose Voronoi cells intersect
with the line segment between the source and destination are
eligible to relay the packet.
Another related and interesting problem in literature is
the longest edge of connected geometric graphs. Penrose [6]
(1997) [7] (1999) studied the longest edge of a minimal span-
ning tree which is corresponding to the critical transmission
radius for connectivity in random geometric graphs. Later, by
applying the percolation theory, Gupta and Kumar [8] had sim-
ilar results for wireless networks. Recently, Baccelli and Bor-
denave [9] (2007) introduced a structure called radial spanning
trees (RSTs) in which each node, excluding the root s at the
origin of the plane, has an edge to its closest neighbor among
nodes closer to the root s. The length of the longest edge
of RSTs can be given by max
u∈V,u=s
min
w∈B(s,‖s−u‖)∩V
‖w − u‖.
If s is the only destination, then the value is the critical
transmission radius for local-minimum-free GFR.
In this paper, we study the deliverability by giving the
asymptotics of ρ (V ) where V is a Poisson point process.
Assume that the deployment region D is a convex compact
region whose boundary has bounded curvature. By scaling,
we assume D have unit area. Let Pn denote a Poisson point
process of density n over D. The ratio of ρ (Pn) to
√

πn is
asymptotically almost surely equal to
√

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we present our main results and show some possible
applications. In Section III, the proof of main results is
given, but most calculation details and related geometric and
probabilistic lemmas are left in the appendix. In Section
IV, simulation results were given to evidence our asymptotic
analysis. Our conclusions are in Section V.
II. MAIN RESULTS
Let D be a unit-area convex compact region with a bounded-
curvature boundary, and Pn denote a Poisson point process of
density n over D. Let β0 = 1/

result of this paper is the following theorem.

= 1.
Since the converge is in probability, we remark Theorem 1
can’t be simplified to limn→∞ ρ (Pn) =
√
β0 lnn
nπ . Based on
Theorem 1, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 2: If the transmission radius is set to
√
β lnn
πn for
some constant β, we have
1) If β > β0, it is asymptotic almost sure that packets can
be delivered by GFR between any pair of nodes.1
2) If β < β0, it is asymptotic almost sure that packets can’t
be delivered by GFR between some pairs of nodes.
Possible Applications: In the rest of this section, we show
some possible applications of Theorem 1. Due to harsh de-
ployment environment coupled with a large amount of sensors
to be deployed, random deployment is unavoidable in many
applications of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. At the
same time, owing to the constraint on the maximal transmis-
sion power, each wireless device can only communicate with
nearby nodes, and therefore connectivity of network topology
and deliverability of routing protocols are the most important
issue of randomly deployed networks. Our asymptotic research
results associated with simulation data can be a good reference
to the following problems and help us to improve energy
efficiency.
• Maximal transmission power: According to path loss
models of wireless communications, the maximal trans-
mission power is strongly related to the maximal trans-
mission radius and is a key parameter during the design
phase of wireless devices. The choosing of the maximal
transmission power can base on the maximal transmission
radius. Our results show that Θ
(√
lnn
n
)
is a good
reference for choosing the maximal transmission radius.2

For each cell fully contained in D, we draw a disk with radius

nπ at the center of the cell. For 1 ≤ i ≤ In, let Ei be
the event that there exist two nodes X,Y ∈ Pn such that
their midpoint is in the i-th disk and their distance is between
R1 (n) and R2 (n), and there is no other node in the lune
LXY . For any two nodes u and v with ‖u− v‖ > rn, if there
is no other node in Luv , u and v are local minima w.r.t. each
other. So, Ei implies existence of local minima and
Pr [ρ (Pn) > rn] ≥ Pr [at least one Ei occurs] . (5)
Let oi denote the center of the i-th disk, and u, v be two points
such that their midpoint is on the disk and their distance is
between R1 (n) and R2 (n). (See Fig. 4.) Since the middle
point of u and v, called z, is in the disk, we have‖oi − z‖ ≤

Since the cell width is 4

nπ , u, v and Luv are contained
in the i-th cell. Therefore, E1, · · · , EIn are independent. In
addition, E1, · · · , EIn are identical. Then,
Pr [none of Ei occurs] = (1− Pr [E1])In ≤ e−In Pr(E1).
If In Pr (E1) → ∞, then Pr [ρ (Pn) > rn] → 1 follows, and
from Eq. (5), the lower bound for ρ (Pn) in Theorem 1 is
obtained. So, we only need to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 4: In Pr (E1) →∞.
The proof of Lemma 4 is given in the appendix and also
can be found in [10].

IV. SIMULATIONS
In the simulation, networks are composed of 200, 400, or
800 nodes distributed over a unit-area disk. Let n denote the
network size, i.e. the number of nodes in a network. For each
network size, 400 topologies are generated by uniform random
point processes. For each network topology, the actual critical
transmission radius, denoted by CTR, is computed according
to Eq. (1). To avoid ambiguity, the estimated (or theoretical)
critical transmission radius given by Theorem 1 is denoted by
ρn.
First, we would like to observe the trend of convergence
of CTRs. For n = 200, 400, and 800 respectively, the
average CTRs are 0.1808, 0.1332, and 0.1000, and the
theoretical radius ρn are 0.1469, 0.1104, and 0.0825. To have
a fair comparison over different network sizes, CTRs are
normalized by being divided by the corresponding ρn. The
CDFs of normalized CTRs are illustrated in Fig. 5. The

For any convex compact set C ⊂ R2, we use C−r to denote
the set of points of C that are away from ∂C by at least r.
Lemma 7: Suppose that C ⊂ R2 is a convex compact set
with diameter at most d. Then,
|C−r| ≥ |C| − πdr.
An ε-tessellation divides the plane by vertical and horizontal
lines into a grid in which each grid cell has width ε. Without
loss of generality, we assume the origin is a corner of cells. In
a tesselation, a polyquadrate is a collection of cells intersecting
with a convex compact set. For example, in Fig. 8, the
shaded cells form a polyquadrate induced by a polygon. The
horizontal span of a polyquadrate is the horizontal distance
measured in the number of cells from the left to the right.
The vertical span of a polyquadrate is defined similarly but in
the vertical direction. If the span of a convex compact set is s
and the width of each cell is l, the span of the corresponding
polyquadrate is at most s/l+ 1.
Lemma 8: If S consists of m cells and τ is a positive
integer constant, the number of polyquadrates with span at
most τ and intersecting with S is Θ(m).
Now, we introduce a technique to obtain the Jacobian
determinant in the change of variables that will be implicitly
used in the proof of Lemma 4. Assume a tree topology is
fixed over x1, x2, · · · , xk ∈ R2. Without loss of generality,
we may assume (xk−1, xk) is one of edges. Let zk−1 =
1
2 (xk−1 + xk), r =
1
2 ‖xk − xk−1‖, and θ be the slope of
xk−1xk. For 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2, we use p (xi) to denote xi’s
parent in the tree rooted at xk, and let zi = 12 (xi + p (xi)).
Let I2 denote a 2×2 identity matrix and 0 denote a 2×2 zero
matrix. Then, the Jacobian determinant for changing variables
x1, · · · , xk−1, xk by z1, · · · , zk−1, (r, θ) is∣∣∣∣ ∂ (x1, · · · , xk−1, xk)∂ (z1, · · · , zk−1, r, θ)
∣∣∣∣
=
∣∣∣∣∂ (x1 + p (x1) , · · · , xk−1 + p (xk−1) , xk)∂ (z1, · · · , zk−1, r, θ)

In the first equality, each non-root variable is added by
its parent variable. The equality stands since the Jacobian
determinant is equal to 1 as we add one variable to another.
We remark if the function to be integrated is independent of
the variable θ, then after changing variables, the integral over
θ is equal to 2π. Actually, this is the most case in this paper.
B. Preliminaries of Poisson RVs
We first present an estimation of the lower-tail distribution
of Poisson RVs.

Pr (Po (λ) ≤ μλ) = 1√

Proof: In this proof, the symbol ∼ refers to the limit
λ →∞. First, for any μ ∈ (0, 1), we show that the lower tail
distribution of a Poisson RV can be given by
Pr (Po (λ) ≤ μλ) ∼ 1
1− μ Pr(Po (λ) = μλ).
Since
Pr (Po (λ) = k − 1)
Pr (Po (λ) = k)
=

We need to estimate the number of subsets with some
specified topology, for example, two nodes are local minima
w.r.t. each other. But it is not so easy to estimate this among
Poisson point processes. The Palm theory allows us to place
a set of random points first and then estimate the expectation
over the Poisson point process. This technique will be used in
the proof of Lemma 4.
C. Proof of Lemma 3
To have the lower bound for minimal scan statistics, we ap-
ply the tessellation technique to discrete the scanning process.
The deployment region is tessellated into equal-size square
cells by properly choosing the cell size such that: (1) each
copy of the lune contains a polyquadrates with area at least
c lnnn for some c > 1 (or
1
2c
lnn
n if the copy crosses ∂D), and
(2) the number of polyquadrates is O
(
n
lnn
)
(or O
(√
n
lnn
)
if
the copy crosses ∂D). Then, the lemma follows Lemma 10.
The detail is given below.
Proof: For a given β1, choose a constant β2 ∈ (β1, β).
Let ε = 1
6
√
2β0
(
1− β2β
)
, d =
√
3rn, and consider an εd-
tessellation. (Note that ε is chosen such that each copy of the
lune contains a polyquadrate with area at least c lnn for some
c > 1.) Let In denote the number of polyquadrates in D with
span at most 1ε and area at least
β2
β0
πr2n
β =
(
β2
β0
+ o (1)
)
lnn
n ,
and Yi be the number of nodes on the i-th polyquadrate. Then
Yi is a Poisson RV with rate at least
(
β2
β0
+ o (1)
)
lnn. Since
the number of cells in D is O
(
n
lnn
)
, by Lemma 8,
In = O
((
1
εd
)2)
= O
( n
lnn
)
.
By Lemma 10, it is a.a.s. that
minIni=1 Yi
lnn
≥ L
(
β2
β0
)
> L
(
β1
β0
)
.
Now, let I ′n denote the number of polyquadrates in D \ D−d
with span at most 1ε and area at least
1

β2
β0
πr2n
β =

2
(
β2

)
lnn
n , and Y
′
i be the number of nodes on the
i-th polyquadrate. Then Y ′i is a Poisson RV with rate at least
1
2
(
β2
β0
+ o (1)
)
lnn. Since the number of cells in D \ D−d is
O
(√
n
lnn
)
, by Lemma 8,
I ′n = O
(
1
εd
)
= O
(√
n
lnn
)
.
By Lemma 10, it is a.a.s. that
minI

2
L
(
β2

2
L
(
β1
β0
)
.
Therefore, it is a.a.s. that
min
(
minIni=1 Yi,min
I′n
i=1 Y
′
i
)
lnn
>
1
2
L
(

β0
)
.
Thus, the lemma follows if we can show that
S (Pn, rn) ≥ min
(
In
min
i=1
Yi,
I′n
min
i=1
Y ′i
)
.
To prove this inequality, it is sufficient to show that for any
lune L of two points in D which are separated by a distance of
rn, it either contains a polyquadrate in D with span at most
1
ε and area at least
β2
β0
πr2n
β , or contains a polyquadrate in
D \ D−d with span at most 1ε and area at least 12 β2β0
πr2n
β . We
shall prove this in two cases.
Case 1: L is contained in D. Let P denote the polyquadrate
induced by L−√2εd. Then, P ⊆ L ⊆ D, and the span of P is
at most
⌈
d−2√2εd
εd
⌉
+1 ≤ 1ε . By Lemma 7 and using the fact
that |L| = πr2n/β0 = πd2/ (3β0), we have
|P | ≥ ∣∣L−√2εd∣∣ ≥ |L| − πd(√2εd) = |L| − √2επd2
= |L|
(
1− 3
√
2β0ε
)
> |L|
(
1− 6
√
2β0ε
)
=
β2
β
|L|
=
β2
β0
πr2n
β
.
Case 2: L is not contained in D. Then L must be disjoint
with D−d. Let L′ = L∩D and let P ′ denote the polyquadrate
induced by L′−√2εd. Then P
′ ⊆ L′ ⊆ D \ D−d and the the
span of P is also at most 1ε . By Lemma 7 and Lemma 5, we
have
|P ′| ≥
∣∣∣L′−√2εd
∣∣∣ ≥ |L′| − πd(√2εd) ≥ 1
2
|L| −
√
2πεd2
=
1
2
|L|
(
1− 6√2β0ε
)
=
1
2
β2
β
|L| = 1
2
β2

πr2n

.
Thus, the lemma is proved.
D. Proof of Lemma 4
We introduce several relevant events and derive their prob-
abilities. For convenience, we use R1 and R2 as shorthand for
R1 (n) and R2 (n), respectively. Note that 12R2 ≤ R1 ≤ R2
and π

nπ at the center of the first cell. Assume V is a point
set and T ⊂ V . Let h1 (T, V ) denote a function such
that h1 (T = {x1, x2} , V ) = 1 only if 12 (x1 + x2) ∈ A,
R1 ≤ ‖x1 − x2‖ ≤ R2, and there is no other node of V
in the lune area Lx1x2 ; otherwise, h1 (T, V ) = 0. Then, E1
is the event that there exist two nodes X,Y ∈ Pn such that
h1 ({X,Y } ,Pn) = 1. In addition, under Boolean addition,
for any {x1, x2, x3} ⊆ V , let
h2 ({x1, x2, x3} , V ) = h1 ({x1, x2} , V ) · h1 ({x1, x3} , V )
+ h1 ({x2, x1} , V ) · h1 ({x2, x3} , V )
+ h1 ({x3, x1} , V ) · h1 ({x3, x2} , V ) ;
for any {x1, x2, x3, x4} ⊆ V , let
h3 ({x1, x2, x3, x4} , V ) = h1 ({x1, x2} , V ) · h1 ({x3, x4} , V )
+ h1 ({x1, x3} , V ) · h1 ({x2, x4} , V )
+ h1 ({x1, x4} , V ) · h1 ({x2, x3} , V ) .
For the sake of clarity, in the remaining of this sub-
section, we use X1, X2, X3 and X4 to denote inde-
pendent random points with uniform distribution over D
and independent of Pn, and X ′1, X ′2, X ′3 and X ′4 to de-
note elements of Pn. Let F ′1 ({X ′1, X ′2}) be the event that
h1 ({X ′1, X ′2} ,Pn) = 1; F ′2 ({X ′1, X ′2, X ′3}) be the event

In wireless networks, to avoid collisions of simultaneous transmissions over the same
channel, adjacent nodes are assigned distinct channels, and the least number of channels
used in an assignment is called the chromatic number. The determination of the chromatic
number is NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce an analytic tool called maximum scan
statistics. For a finite point set V and a convex compact set C , themaximum scan statistic of
V with respect to the scanning set C is the largest number of points in V covered by a copy
C . Based on the study of asymptotic maximum scan statistics, we obtain the asymptotics
of the maximum degree and the clique number of homogeneous wireless networks. The
results imply that the chromatic number is almost surely at most four times the clique
number. We further prove that the approximation ratios of some vertex-ordering-based
First-Fit channel assignment algorithms are almost surely bounded by 2. In the analysis,
we also learn that the chromatic number is almost surely at most twice the clique number.

1. Introduction
In homogeneous wireless ad hoc networks, each node has the same transmission range r , and two nodes have a link
between them if the distance between them is at most r . Two nodes can communicate with each other either through a
single hop direct link if they are within each other’s transmission range or through a multi-hop communication session
otherwise. The induced network topology is called r-disk graphs, or unit disk graphs (UDGs) if r is scaled to 1. Because
there is no need for fixed infrastructures, wireless ad hoc networks can be flexibly deployed at low cost for varyingmissions
such as decision making in battlefields, emergency disaster relief and environmental monitoring. In many applications, for
example wireless sensor networks, a large number of devices will be randomly deployed. Consequently, wireless networks
are represented by unit disk graphs over random point sets, and the induced network topology is called random disk graphs.
In the literature, asymptotic analysis is interesting to the research community; see, e.g., [1–4].
Inwireless networks, each node can be in either sending or receivingmode but not both at the same time. Due to the short
transmission range, each node can only transmit messages to or receive messages from nearby nodes. To avoid collisions
of simultaneous transmissions over the same channel, adjacent nodes are assigned distinct channels. The assignment of
channels can be modeled by vertex coloring of graphs. A vertex coloring, assigning one color to each vertex, is proper if no
adjacent vertices receive the same color. For a graph G, χ (G) denotes the least number of colors used in a proper coloring
of G and is called the chromatic number of G.
Let G(V , E) denote a graph with vertex set V and edge set E. A graph H(V ′, E ′) is a subgraph of G(V , E) if V ′ ⊆ V and
E ′ ⊆ E. In addition, if E ′ = {(u, v) ∈ E : ∀u, v ∈ V ′}, H is called a induced subgraph of G (by V ′). For any vertex u ∈ V ,
deg (u) denotes the number of vertices adjacent to u and is called the vertex degree of u. δ (G) = minu∈V deg (u) and

3.1. Theorem 5 on Poisson point processes
A lower bound for SM (Pn, Cn) is given by the following lemma.
Lemma 6. For any ε > 0, we have Pr
[
SM (Pn,Cn)
ln n ≥ (1− ε)U (β)
]
→ 1.
Proof. Tessellate the plane into equal-size square cells with width c0
√
β ln n
n . For any given Cn ∈ Cn, since diam (Cn) ≤
c0
√
β ln n
n , we can place one copy of Cn in each cell that is fully contained inD, and those copies of Cn are pairwise disjoint. Let
In be the number of copies of Cn. In = Ω
( 1
c0
√
β ln n
n
)2 = Ω ( nln n ). Let Yi denote the number of nodes in the i-th copy of
Cn for any 1 ≤ i ≤ In. Y1, Y2, . . . , YIn are i.i.d. Poisson RVs with rate (β + o (1)) ln n. Since SM (Pn, Cn) ≥ max1≤i≤In Yi, from
Lemma 2(2), it is a.a.s. that, for any given ε > 0,
SM (Pn, Cn) ≥ (1− ε)U (β) ln n.
So, this lemma is proved. 
An upper bound for SM (Pn, Cn) is given by the following lemma.
Lemma 7. For any ε > 0, we have Pr
[
SM (Pn,Cn)
ln n ≤ (1+ ε)U (β)
]
→ 1.
Proof. Let dn = c0
√
β ln n
n . Recall that diam (Cn) ≤ dn for all Cn ∈ Cn. Since U (β) is an increasing function, for a given
ε > 0, we choose β1 > β such thatU (β1) = (1+ ε)U (β). Let δ = min
(

)
and M =
⌈
1
δdn
⌉
. Divide D by a
δdn-tessellation. Let P be a polyquadrate corresponding to Cn. Since P ⊆ (Cn)√2δdn , we have
|P| ≤ ∣∣(Cn)√2δdn ∣∣
≤ |Cn| +
√
2δdn · peri (Cn)+ pi
(√
2δdn
)2
(by Lemma 3)

√
2δdn (pidn)+ pi

(√

)
piδd2n ≤ |Cn| + 2piδd2n ∼ |Cn| + 2piδc20 |Cn|
= (1+ 2pic20δ) |Cn| ≤ β1 + β2β |Cn| = β1 + β2 ln nn .
If Y is the number of nodes in P , Y is a Poisson RV with rate at most β1+β2 ln n. Let In denote the number of polyquadrates
that are induced by a copy of Cn ∈ Cn, and Y1, Y2, . . . , YIn be the number of nodes in each polyquadrate. Since the span of P
is at mostm = ddnMe + 1 ≤ 1δ + dn + 1, that asymptotically depends only on the constant δ, by Lemma 4, we have
In = O
(
M2
) = O( 1

(

|Cn|

( n

.
Since β1+β2 < β1, from Lemma 2(1), it is a.a.s. that
SM (Pn, Cn) ≤ max
1≤i≤In
Yi < U (β1) ln n = (1+ ε)U (β) ln n.
So, the lemma is proved. 
3.2. De-Poissonization
Here we introduce a de-Poissonization technique that allow us to extend results on Poisson point processes to uniform
point processes. By Chebyshev inequality, it is almost sure that Po

Fig. 5. Draw two disks with radius δrn and (1− δ)rn at the center of a cell. If there exists a node v in the small disk, B(v, rn) contains the annulus with radii
δrn and (1− δ)rn .
4.2. Maximum degrees
This subsection is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 8(2).
For each node in r-disk graphs, all its neighbors are in a disk of radius r centered at this node. Let Cn = {B (o, rn)}.
Obviously,∆
(
Grn (Vn)
) ≤ SM (Vn, Cn)− 1. Hence, applying Theorem 5, for any ε > 0, we have
Pr
[
∆
(
Grn (Vn)
)
ln n
≤ (1+ ε)U (β)
]
→ 1. (7)
In the following lemma, a lower bound for the maximum degree is provided.
Lemma 10. Let npir2n = (β + o (1)) ln n for some β > 0. For any ε > 0, we have
Pr
[
∆
(
Grn (Vn)
)
ln n
≥ (1− ε)U (β)
]
→ 1.
Proof. SinceU (β) is an increasing function, for any given ε > 0, we can choose β1 < β such thatU (β1) = (1− ε)U (β).
Let δ = β−β13β . Divide the plane into equal-size square cells by a 4rn-tessellation. For each cell fully contained in D, draw two
concentric disks at the center with radius δrn and (1− δ) rn. Since δ < 13 , the disk with radius δrn is contained in the disk
with radius (1− δ) rn. The area of small disks is pi (δrn)2, and the area of annuli of radii δrn and (1− δ) rn is
pi
(
((1− δ) rn)2 − (δrn)2
) = (1− 2δ) pir2n .
Consider a cell and the two concentric disks in it. See Fig. 5. If there exists a node v in the small disk, B (v, rn) contains the
annulus and is contained in the cell.
First, we consider that Vn is a Poisson point process. Let In be the number of non-empty small disks, and Y1, . . . , YIn be
the number of nodes in the corresponding annuli of those non-empty small disks. For each small disk, the event that the
disk is not empty is a Bernoulli trial with probability 1− e−npi(δrn)2 . So, In is a binomial RV withΘ
( n
ln n
)
trials. By Chebyshev
inequality, we can prove In = Θ
( n
ln n
)
. In addition, Y1, . . . , YIn are Poisson RVs with means
(1− 2δ) npir2n =
β + 2β1
3β
npir2n =
(
1+ β − β1
3β1
)
β1 ln n,
and since those annuli are pairwise disjoint, Y1, . . . , YIn are i.i.d. Since ∆
(
Grn (Pn)
) ≥ max1≤i≤In Yi, applying Lemma 2, we
have
∆
(
Grn (Pn)
)
ln n
≥
max
1≤i≤In
Yi
ln n
> U (β1) = (1− ε)U (β) .
Applying the de-Poissonization technique introduced in Section 3.2, we can obtain the same result on Xn. Hence, the
lemma is proved. 
Theorem 8(2) follows Eq. (7) and Lemma 10.

(1) Smallest-last ordering (SL): The vertices are greedily selected in reverse order. Each time, a vertex with the smallest
degree in the remaining induced subgraph is selected and removed. This vertex ordering has the least inductivity, i.e.
indSL (G) = δ∗ (G). [17]
(2) Distance-increasing ordering (DI): The vertices are sorted in the increasing order of their Euclidean distances from an
arbitrary fixed point.
(3) Lexicographic ordering (LG): The vertices are sorted in the lexicographic order of their coordinates.
(4) Radius-decreasing ordering (RD): The vertices are sorted in the decreasing order of their transmission radii. If all nodes
have the same transmission radii, the ordering is random.
For any vertex set V and transmission radius r , the approximation ratios of indSL (Gr (V )), indDI (Gr (V )), indLG (Gr (V )),
and indRD (Gr (V )) to χ (Gr (V )), respectively, are 3, 3, 3, and 5 [11]. For any vertex ordering g , we have
ω (Gr (V )) ≤ χ (Gr (V )) ≤ indg (Gr (V ))+ 1 ≤ ∆ (Gr (V ))+ 1.
Hence, from Theorem 8, it is a.a.s. that indg(Grn (Vn))
ω(Grn (Vn))
. 4. In addition, since indSL
(
Grn (Vn)
) = δ∗ (Grn (Vn)), from Theorem 11,
it is a.a.s. that indSL(Grn (Vn))
ω(Grn (Vn))
. 2. Moreover, applying the argument used in Theorem 11 to the vertex ordering DI and LG, we
can prove that it is a.a.s. that indDI(Grn (Vn))
ω(Grn (Vn))
. 2 and indLG(Grn (Vn))
ω(Grn (Vn))
. 2. Therefore, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 12. It is a.a.s. that the approximation ratio of any First-Fit algorithm is at most 4. Furthermore, it is a.a.s. that the
approximation ratios of First-Fit in SL, DI, LG are at most 2. Furthermore, the chromatic number is a.a.s. at most twice of the clique
number.
6. Conclusion
Channel assignment is an essential problem for wireless networks and is NP-hard. In this paper, we assume that
homogeneous wireless ad hoc networks are modeled by r-disk graphs over random point processes with mean density
n. First, we introduce an analytic tool called maximum scan statistics and show that the maximum scan statistics of Poisson
point processes or uniformpoint processeswith respect to regular scanning sets of area (β + o (1)) ln nn can be asymptotically
approximated by U (β) ln n. Next, we consider that the transmission radius rn is given by npir2n = (β + o (1)) ln n. Based
on maximum scan statistics, we prove that the maximum degree and clique number of rn-disk graphs are a.a.s.U (β) ln n
andU
(
β
4
)
ln n, respectively. This result implies that the chromatic number is a.a.s. upper bounded by four times the clique
number. Last, we give analysis of several vertex-ordering-based First-Fit channel assignment algorithms, and show that the
approximation ratio of any First-Fit algorithm is a.a.s. bounded by 4 and the approximation ratios of First-Fit algorithms in
SL, DI, LG are a.a.s. bounded by 2. The analysis also implies that the chromatic number is a.a.s. upper bounded by twice the
clique number.

radius of the networking nodes be no shorter than the longest edge in the RNG.
While the maximum edge length in the RNG can be easily computed in polynomial
time, little is known about its random behavior when the underlying vertex set is
a random point set. In this paper, we derive the precise asymptotic distribution of
the maximum edge length in the RNG of a Poisson point process over a unit-area
disk with density n, which is denoted by Pn.

RNG of a ﬁnite planar set V by RNG(V ). Denote by σ the geometric constant

The main result of this paper is stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1. limn→∞ Pr[λ(RNG(Pn)) ≤ rn] = e−µ.
It is interesting to compare the maximum edge length of the RNG with the
maximum edge length of the (Euclidean) minimum spanning tree (MST), which is
also known the critical transmission radius for connectivity [5], and the maximum
edge length of the Gabriel graph (GG) [4], which also has many applications in
wireless ad hoc networks. Let MST (V ) and GG(V ) denote the MST and the GG
of ﬁnite planar set V . It is well-known that for any ﬁnite planar set,
MST (V ) ⊆ RNG(V ) ⊆ GG(V ).
Thus,
λ(MST (V )) ≤ λ(RNG(V )) ≤ λ(GG(V )).
The asymptotic distributions of λ(MST (Pn)) and λ(GG(Pn)) were derived in [11]
(based on an earlier result [2]) and in [16] respectfully. Speciﬁcally, for any con-
stant c,

.
So roughly speaking, the maximum edge length of the RNG (respectfully, GG) of
a Poisson point process is asymptotically about 1.6 times (respectfully, twice) its
critical transmission radius for connectivity.
Another parameter closely related to the maximum edge length of the RNG is
the critical transmission radius for greedy forward routing [3, 14]. In greedy for-
ward routing, each node discards a packet if none of its neighbors is closer to the

A geometric graph is a graph on a ﬁnite planar set whose edges are line segments.
Let H be a geometric graph. We use V (H) and E(H) to denote the vertex set and
edge set of H respectively. Let χ(H) be the indicator for H ⊆ RNG(V (H)) and

Corollary 2.4. Suppose that τ ∈ Tm is not a perfect matching. Then,
nm

Proof. Clearly, m > 2. Let τ ′ be a maximal spanning forest of τ . Then, τ ′ ∈ Tm
and τ ′ is not a perfect matching. In addition, Γ(τ ′) ⊇ Γ(τ), and for any x ∈ Γ(τ),
fn(τ ′(x)) ≥ fn(τ(x)).
Hence, ∫
Γ(τ)
fn(τ(x))dx ≤
∫
Γ(τ)
fn(τ ′(x))dx ≤
∫
Γ(τ ′)

Thus, it is suﬃcient to show that

Let k be the number of edges in τ ′. Then, τ has m− k tree components and hence

Since τ ′ is not a perfect matching, we have m < 2k, which implies m− k ≤ k − 1.
By Lemma 2.2, for any 1 ≤ l ≤ m− k,

For any geometric graph H , let Bn(H) be the indicator for H ⊆ RNG(V (H) ∪

For any x ∈ Γ(τ),
Pr[Bn(τ(x)) = 1] ≤ fn(τ(x)).

3. Proof for Theorem 1.1
We ﬁrst give a brief overview on our approach to prove Theorem 1.1. Let Mn
(respectively, M ′n and M
′′
n ) denote the number of edges in RNG(Pn) with length
in (rn, Rn] (respectively, (Rn, R′n] and (R′n,+∞)). Then, λ(RNG(Pn)) ≤ rn if and
only if Mn + M ′n + M ′′n = 0. In Lemma 3.1, we will show that M ′′n = 0 is a.a.s. In
Lemma 3.4, we will prove that E[M ′n] = o(1), which implies that M ′n = 0 is a.a.s.
by Markov’s inequality. In Lemma 3.6, we will prove that Mn is asymptotically
Poisson with mean µ. Consequently,
lim
n→∞Pr[λ(RNG(Pn)) ≤ rn] = limn→∞Pr[Mn + M
′
n + M
′′
n = 0]
= lim
n→∞Pr[Mn = 0]
= e−µ.
We ﬁrst utilize the tool of minimal scan statistics developed in [17] to prove that
M ′′n = 0 is a.a.s.
Lemma 3.1. Pr[M ′′n > 0] = o(1).
Proof. For any ﬁnite point set V ⊂ D and any r > 0, deﬁne
S(V, r) = min
{u,v}⊂D,‖uv‖=r
|V ∩ L(uv)|.
For any pair of {u, v} ⊂ D with ‖uv‖ = R′n,
n|L(uv)| = n · σ(R′n)2 =
(
1 +
ε
2
)2
lnn > (1 + ε) lnn.
Using this fact and following the same argument in the proof of Lemma 9 in [17],
we can prove that S(Pn, R′n) > Θ(lnn) is a.a.s. In particular, S(Pn, R′n) > 0 a.a.s.
Next, we claim that the event M ′′n > 0 implies the event S(Pn, R′n) = 0. Suppose
that M ′′n > 0. Then there are a pair of nodes {X,Y } ⊂ Pn such that ‖XY ‖ > R′n
and L(XY ) ∩ Pn is empty. Let Y ′ be the point on the line segment XY satisfying
that ‖XY ′‖ = R′n. Thus L(XY ′) ⊂ L(XY ). So L(XY ′)∩Pn is empty. This implies

Lemma 3.5. For any fixed positive integer k,
E[card(Hn,k)] ∼ µ

k!
.
Proof. For any pair (U, V ) with V being a ﬁnite planar set and U being a subset
of V , deﬁne h(U, V ) to be the number of k-edge subgraphs of RNG(V ) on U in
which all edges have length in (rn, Rn] and no vertex is isolated. By applying the
Palm theory, we have
E[card(Hn)] = E

Thus, it is suﬃcient to show that

E[h(Xm,Xm ∪ Pn)] =


0, if 2 ≤ m < 2k;
µk
k!
, if m = 2k.
For any positive integer k and any 2 ≤ m ≤ 2k, denote Tm,k the set of topologies
in Tm with exactly k edges. Note that any topology in T2k,k is a perfect matching,
and
card(T2k,k) = 1
k!
(
2k
2, 2, . . . , 2
)
=
(2k)!
k!2k
.
By Lemma 2.5, we have
n2k
(2k)!
E[h(X2k,X2k ∪ Pn)] = 1(2k)!

Now suppose that 2 ≤ m < 2k. Then any topology in Tm,k is not a perfect matching.
By Lemma 2.5,
nmE[h(Xm,Xm ∪ Pn)] =
∑
τ∈Tm,k
nmE[Bn(τ(Xm))] = o(1).
Finally, we apply the Brun’s sieve together with Lemma 3.5 to prove Mn is
asymptotically Poisson.

Proof. The lemma holds trivially if x ∈ Dρ(0) or x ∈ Dρ(2). So, we consider the
case that x ∈ Dρ(1). It is easy to see that
θ(x, ρ) ≤ 4 arcsin t(x)

If e ⊂ D and the midpoint of e is apart from ∂D by at least

The next lemma gives a lower bound on |L(e) ∩ D| if otherwise.
Lemma 4.2. Consider a line segment e ⊂ D with midpoint z. If t(z) ≤

2 ‖e‖,
then
|L(e) ∩ D| ≥ 1
2
|L(e)|+ ‖e‖
2
t(z).
Proof. Let a and b be the two endpoints of e, and c1 and c2 be the two vertices
of L(e) with c1 being farther away from the center of D (see Fig. 3). Then, the half
lune abc2 is fully contained in D. If c1 ∈ ∂D, then the triangle abc1 is contained in
D and its area is ‖e‖2 ‖az‖ ≥ ‖e‖2 t(z). So, the lemma holds if c1 ∈ ∂D. Now assume
that c1 /∈ ∂D. Let u be the intersection point of c1z and ∂D. Then, the triangle
abu is contained in D and its area is ‖e‖2 ‖uz‖ ≥ ‖e‖2 t(z). So, the lemma also holds if
c1 /∈ ∂D.
For any geometric graph H on a ﬁnite subset of D, an edge e of H is called an
outermost edge of H if its midpoint is the nearest to ∂D.
Lemma 4.3. Suppose that H is a geometric graph over a finite subset of D with at
least two edges satisfying that all the edges have length between R/(1+ ε) and R for

Abstract The minimum disc cover can be used to construct a dominating set on the
fly for energy-efficient communications in mobile ad hoc networks, but the approach
used to compute the minimum disc cover proposed in previous studies is computa-
tionally relatively expensive. In this paper, we show that the disc cover problem is
in fact a special case of the general α-hull problem. In spite of being a special case,
the disc cover problem is not easier than the general α-hull problem. In addition to
applying the existing α-hull algorithm to solve the disc cover problem, we present a
simple, yet optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm that constructs the minimum disc
cover for arbitrary cases, including those degenerate cases where the α-hull approach
would fail.

Fig. 1 The α-hull and convex
hull (the dashed lines) for a
given set of points
i’s location as Oi , or simply i if there is no ambiguity, and denote its coverage disc
as D(Oi), or simply Di . The Euclidean distance between nodes i and j is denoted as
dist(Oi,Oj ), or dist(i, j). The minimum disc cover problem is formally defined as
follows.
Definition 1 Minimum Disc Cover Problem
Instance: A set of unit discs,  = {D0,D1,D2, . . . ,Dn}, such that dist(D0,Di) < 11
for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Question: Find a subset ′ ⊆  such that ∣∣′∣∣ is minimum and
⋃
Di∈′
Di =
⋃
Dj∈
Dj .
(Note that no two discs share the same origin. Also, D0 may be included in ′.)
We will relate the minimum disc cover problem to another problem, called α-hull.
For any negative number α and any set of points S on a two-dimensional plane, the α-
hull for S is defined as the intersection of all closed complements of discs (with radius
−1/α) that contain all the points in S [4]. (Note that it is the discs’ complements, not
the discs themselves, that contain the points in S.)
Since we are only interested in unit discs, we will assume α = −1 unless other-
wise indicated. With such an assumption, the shape of an α-hull resembles an inward
curved convex hull, where each edge of the α-hull is an arc of a unit circle. A con-
venient way to visualize the shape of an α-hull is to envision the points in S as nails
fixed on the plane and a steel wheel of radius 1 is rolled around the nails to obtain the
outer contour of S. The contour is the α-hull for S. Figure 1 illustrates a set of points’
α-hull as well as its convex hull.
The following theorem shows a simple connection between the minimum disc
cover and α-hull problems.
Theorem 1 Let  = {D0,D1, . . . ,Dn} be an instance of the minimum disc cover
problem, and let S = {O0,O1, . . . ,On} be the corresponding set of origins. Then the
set of all vertices of S’s α-hull, with α = −1, corresponds to a minimum cover for .
1In this paper, we adopt the open disk model. However, the same results can be had for the close disk
model, where dist(D0,Di) < 1 is replaced by dist(D0,Di) ≤ 1 in the problem definition.
62 Algorithmica (2008) 50: 58–71
Fig. 3 The distance between a
and x is at least 1 if x is not
covered by D(p) and D(q)
Fig. 4 The disc centered at a
vertex of the α-hull covers some
area not covered by other nodes
in S
Now, we establish the optimality of ′ by showing that any disc cover for  must
contain ′ as a subset. Let C be the set of origins of any disc cover for , and let p
be any point in P . We need to show p ∈ C.
If the steel unit disc rolls around a point p ∈ P without touching another one, all
other points in S have to be at least 2 units away from p. The only possibility of this
scenario is when p = O0 and S = {O0}.
Now suppose there are at least two points in S. Then, a point p ∈ P must be an
endpoint of some arc pq on the α-hull’s boundary. pq is part of the circumference
of the rolling steel unit disc. Let us denote the origin of the rolling steel unit disc
passing through p and q as c. The disc D(c) must contain no point in S inside it.
Note that points in S could appear on the arc pq, for example the point r in Fig. 4.
Since S contains only a finite number of points, it is easy to see from Fig. 4 that there
is always an area close to c (i.e., the part of the shaded region close to c in Fig. 4)
that is only covered by disc D(p) but not by any other disc in . Therefore, p must
be in C. 

Fig. 6 The boundary of
⋃
Oi∈S D(Oi) is formed by a
series of arcs 〈AiAi+1〉
viewed as the union of Sector(AiAi+1, AiO0, Ai+1O0), 1 ≤ i ≤ k. We show in the
following lemma that the unit discs that contribute arcs AiAi+1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k) form a
minimum disc cover of .
Lemma 2 Let A1A2,

A2A3, . . . ,

Ak−1Ak,

AkAk+1 be the arcs surrounding U =
⋃
Oi∈S D(Oi), where A1 = Ak+1; and for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, let D(Oti ) be the unit disc
that contributes AiAi+1. The set of unit discs, {D(Ot1),D(Ot2), . . . ,D(Otk )}, is a
minimum disc cover for .
Proof We first claim that any unit disc D(Oti ) that contributes an arc to the boundary
of U must be included in any disc cover of . To see this, observe that if AiAi+1
is contributed by Oti , then the area close to

AiAi+1 is not covered by any disc other
than D(Oti ).
Now, the area U can be thought of as a collection of disjoint pieces, each sur-
rounded by AiAi+1, AiO , and Ai+1O , where i ranges from 1 to k. By Lemma 1,
each such piece is covered by a unit disc D(Oti ). Thus, {D(Ot1), . . . ,D(Otk )} is a
disc cover for . Applying the above claim, the cover is minimum. 
Notice that a unit disc D(Oti ) may contribute more than one arc to the boundary
of U . This implies that the same unit disc D(Oti ) may appear more than once in the
disc cover set {D(Ot1),D(Ot2), . . . ,D(Otk )}. In fact, a unit disc in  may contribute
zero, one, or two arcs to the boundary of U . The possibility of contributing more than
one arc is the main reason why the minimum disc cover problem is nontrivial. This
will be further discussed in Sect. 3.5.

Fig. 7 Splitting BC into BF
and FC, and splitting DE into

DG and GE
we sort each list based on the value of the first angle (i.e., αi ) in ascending or-
der, so that βsi = αsi+1 , 0 ≤ i ≤ max, with the understanding that i + 1 is com-
puted modulo max. Thus, the boundary of a super disc can be represented simply
as (Os0 , αs0,Os1, αs1, . . . ,Osmax , αsmax), where 0◦ = αs0 < · · · < αsmax < 360◦.
3.4 Merging Two Arc Lists
Now, given two sorted arc lists
{
ArcList1 = (Os0, αs0 ,Os1, αs1, . . . ,Osmax , αsmax),
ArcList2 = (Ot0 , αt0,Ot1 , αt1, . . . ,Otmax , αtmax)
representing the boundaries of super discs UD(i,m) and UD(m + 1, j), respectively,
we want to merge them so that the resulting list represents the boundary of UD(i, j) =
UD(i,m) ∪ UD(m + 1, j).
The first step is to split the arcs in each list into smaller arcs, if necessary, so that
the two refined arc lists share the same sequence of angles (i.e., α’s). For instance,
as illustrated in Fig. 7, BC is split into BF and FC, and DE is split into DG and

GE. With such splits, arc lists {AB,BC} and {DE,EC} become {AB, BF , FC}
and {DG, GE, EC}, respectively, which share the same sequence of angles with O0
at the apex. As another example, if
{
ArcList1 = (Os0,0◦,Os1 ,30◦,Os2 ,140◦,Os3,200◦),
ArcList2 = (Ot0 ,0◦,Ot1,120◦,Ot2,240◦),
they will be refined to
{
ArcList′1 = (Os0 ,0◦,Os1 ,30◦,Os1 ,120◦,Os2 ,140◦,Os3,200◦,Os3,240◦),
ArcList′2 = (Ot0 ,0◦,Ot0 ,30◦,Ot1 ,120◦,Ot1 ,140◦,Ot1 ,200◦,Ot2 ,240◦).
Now, let us consider the general case. After splitting, the given lists will contain
the same number of arcs:
{
ArcList1 = (Os0 , αs0,Os1 , αs1, . . . ,Osk , αsk ),
ArcList2 = (Ot0 , αs0,Ot1 , αs1, . . . ,Otk , αsk )
for some k. To merge the two lists, we simply merge each individual pair of corre-
sponding arcs, Arc(Osi , αi, αi+1) and Arc(Oti , αi, αi+1) as follows. (See Fig. 8 for
illustration.)

disc. Now, if a disc is able to contribute three arcs to the boundary of
⋃
Oi∈S D(Oi),
the three arcs must be pairwisely separated by at least 120◦. Adding up the degrees of
the angles for the gaps and the degrees of the angles for the arcs themselves, the total
would exceed 360◦, which is not possible. Therefore, a unit disc can only contribute
at most two arcs to the boundary of
⋃
Oi∈S D(Oi). 
Now we are ready to show that our algorithm has time complexity O(n logn).
Theorem 2 Algorithm Boundary has time complexityO(n logn), where n is the num-
ber of unit discs in .
Proof The running time, T (n), of Algorithm Boundary({O0,O1,O2, . . . ,On}; i, j)
satisfies the recurrence
T (n) =
{
T (n2 ) + T (n2 ) + T (ArcMerge) if n > 1,
O(1) if |n| = 1,
where n = j − i + 1. Since each disc can only contribute at most two arcs (by
Lemma 3), ArcList1 and ArcList2 each contain at most O(n) “unsplit” arcs. After
splitting, each list still contains at most O(n) arcs. Since merging two arcs with the
same angle span (as described at the end of Sect. 3.4) takes O(1) time, merging the
two (refined) arc lists takesO(n) time. So, the time complexity of ArcMerge isO(n).
Solving the above recurrence then yields T (n) =O(n logn). 
4 Optimality of the Time Complexity
In an earlier section we established the connection between the minimum disc cover
and α-hull problems; and it has been shown in [4] that any algorithm that constructs

5 Conclusion and Future Work
We showed the minimum disc cover problem to be a special case of the α-hull prob-
lem. Then we showed that being a special case does not make it simpler than the
general α-hull problem in terms of time complexity—both problems need at least
(n logn) time. We proposed two optimal algorithms for constructing minimum disc
covers. The first applies an existing algorithm for the α-hull. However, this approach
needs to construct Delaunay Triangulations and would fail should more than three
disc origins fall on the circumference of a circle. Our second method is a divide-and-
conquer algorithm, which is conceptually simpler and works well even for degenerate
cases.
Although the proposed algorithms are optimal in terms of time complexity, there
may still be room for improvement when the algorithm is used in applications such as
message broadcast or media access control in mobile ad hoc networks. One possibil-
ity is for each node to keep track of its neighbors’ movements and “predict” when the
members of its minimum disc cover are likely to change, and only then re-compute
the new minimum cover. This will reduce the number of times a node computes its
minimum disc cover, thereby reducing the power consumed by such computations.
This is known as the Kinetic Collision Detection model [1]. This model will be ex-
plored in our future work.

Maximizing Lifetime of Sensor Surveillance Systems

Abstract—This paper addresses the maximal lifetime scheduling
problem in sensor surveillance systems. Given a set of sensors and
targets in an area, a sensor can watch only one target at a time, our
task is to schedule sensors to watch targets and forward the sensed
data to the base station, such that the lifetime of the surveillance
system is maximized, where the lifetime is the duration that all tar-
gets are watched and all active sensors are connected to the base
station. We propose an optimal solution to find the target-watching
schedule for sensors that achieves the maximal lifetime. Our solu-
tion consists of three steps: 1) computing the maximal lifetime of
the surveillance system and a workload matrix by using the linear
programming technique; 2) decomposing the workload matrix into
a sequence of schedule matrices that can achieve the maximal life-
time; and 3) determining the sensor surveillance trees based on the
above obtained schedule matrices, which specify the active sensors
and the routes to pass sensed data to the base station. This is the
first time in the literature that the problem of maximizing lifetime
of sensor surveillance systems has been formulated and the optimal
solution has been found.

I. INTRODUCTIONS
ASENSOR SURVEILLANCE system consists of a set ofwireless sensor nodes (sensors for short) and a set of tar-
gets to be monitored. The sensors collaborate with each other
to watch or monitor the targets and pass the sensed data to the
base station. The sensors are powered by batteries and have a
stringent power budget [1], [2]. The nature of the sensor surveil-
lance system requires a long lifetime. In this paper, we discuss a
maximal lifetime problem in sensor surveillance systems. Given
a set of targets, a set of sensors, and a base station (BS) in
an area, the sensors are used to watch the targets and collect
sensed data to the BS. Each sensor has an initial energy reserve,
a fixed surveillance range, and an adjustable transmission range.
A sensor can watch at most one target at a time and a target

should be watched by a sensor at any time. The problem is to
schedule a subset of sensors to be active at a time to watch the
targets and find the routes for the active sensors to send data
back to the BS, such that the lifetime of the entire sensor net-
work is maximized. The lifetime is the duration up to the time
when there exists one target that can no longer be watched by
any sensors or data cannot be forwarded to the BS any longer
due to the depletion of energy of the sensor nodes. We assume
the positions of targets, sensors, and the BS are given in prior
and static. The location information of both sensors and targets
can be obtained via a distributed monitoring mechanism [3] or
the scanning method [4], [5] by the BS.
The solution to this problem includes two parts: scheduling
the sensors to watch targets and routing the sensed data to the
BS. The schedule and the routes are pre-computed at the BS,
and they are disseminated to sensors by the BS at the system
initialization. When the system starts operation, all sensors work
according to the schedule, such as when and for what duration
to sleep, watch targets, or relay messages.
There are many applications of this type of surveillance sys-
tems. For example, sensors equipped with camera are used to
guard cargo containers to prevent them from being tampered
during the long journey of shipment or during the storage at a
port. Another example is the use of sensors to monitor some
hot spots in a region or in a building. In these examples, sen-
sors and targets are static, and each sensor can only focus on
watching one target at a time. For the applications in which one
sensor can watch multiple targets simultaneously, some work
on sensor scheduling has been done in [2] and [6], where sen-
sors are scheduled to work in turn such that a given area can be
covered fully [2] or partially [6] and the system lifetime is max-
imized.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
is related work and Section III is the problem definition.
Section IV presents our solution which consists of three parts.
Section IV-A gives a linear programming formulation that
is used to compute the maximal lifetime of the surveillance
system. In Section IV-B, we show that the maximal lifetime is
achievable, and give the algorithms for scheduling the sensors
to watch targets. Section IV-C discusses surveillance trees for
routing sensed data to BS. Section V gives a numeric example
solved by using our method and simulation results. We con-
clude our work in Section VI.

Equation (1) specifies that for each target in , the total time
that sensors watch it is equal to the lifetime of the system. That
is, each target should be watched throughout the lifetime.
Inequality (2) implies that for each sensor in , the total
watching time should not exceed the lifetime of the system.
Inequality (3) implies that the total energy cost of a sensor
node shall not exceed its initial energy reserve. There are three
components of energy cost, which are the cost for sensing data
(i.e., watching targets), the cost for transmitting data (which is
dependent on the transmission distance), and the cost for re-
ceiving data.
Equation (4) is for flow conservation. It implies that for each
sensor in , the total amount of data sensed and data received
should be equal to the amount of data transmitted.
The above formulation is a typical LP formulation, where ,
and , and , , are
real number variables and the objective is to maximize . The
optimal results of , , and can be computed in polynomial
time.
Notice that , obtained from computing the above LP formu-
lation, is the upper bound on the lifetime, and each specifies
only the total time that sensor should watch target in order
to achieve this upper bound . Each specifies only the total
amount of data transmitted from sensor to sensor . We need
to find a schedule that specifies from what time up to what time
which sensor watches which target and through which route to
pass the sensed data to the BS. In the next two steps we will
find the schedule and routes that will finally achieve the optimal
lifetime .
The values of , and , obtained from
the LP, can be represented as a matrix:
We call matrix the workload matrix, for it specifies
the total length of time that a sensor should watch a target. This
workload matrix has two important properties:
1) The sum of all elements in each column is equal to (from
(1) in the LP formulation).
2) The sum of all elements in each row is less than or equal
to (from in (2) in the LP formulation).
In the next step, we will find the schedule for sensors to watch
targets based on the workload matrix.
B. Decompose Workload Matrix
The lifetime of the surveillance system can be divided into a
sequence of sessions. In each session, a set of sensors are sched-
uled to watch their corresponding targets; and in the next ses-
sion, another set of sensors are scheduled to work (some sensors
may work continuously for multiple sessions). Suppose a sensor
will not switch to watch another target within a session. Thus,
the schedule of sensors during a session can be represented as a
matrix. In this matrix, there is only one positive number in each
column, meaning each target should be watched by one sensor
at a time; and at most one positive number in each row, meaning
each sensor can watch at most one target at a time and there is
no switching to watch other targets in a session. Furthermore, all
the non-zero elements in this matrix have the same value, which
is the time duration of this session. Now, our task becomes to de-
compose the workload matrix into a sequence of schedule ma-
trices of sessions, represented as
(6)
where , is the length of time of session , and
the total number of sessions. We call this sequence of matrices
, the schedule matrices. Each schedule ma-
trix, say for session , has three properties: 1) all elements in
it are either “0” or ; 2) each column has exactly one non-zero
element; and 3) each row has at most one non-zero element (it
could be all “0”, indicating the sensor has no watching duty in
this session).
Next, we discuss how to decompose the workload matrix into
a sequence of schedule matrices. In general sensor surveillance
systems, the number of sensors is greater than the number of
targets, i.e., . We first consider a special case of .
Then, we extend the result to the general case of .
1) A Special Case : We consider the case . Let
and denote the sum of row and the sum of column in
the workload matrix, respectively. According to (1) and (2) of
the LP formulation, we have
(7)
(8)
Furthermore, since and
, we have
(9)
Combining (8) and (9), we have
(10)
From (7) and (10), we have
(11)
Equation (11) gives an important feature of the workload ma-
trix when that the sum of each column is equal to the sum
of each row. This feature will guarantee the possibility of decom-
posing the workload matrix into schedule matrices in Theorem 1.

Now we prove the lemma by contradictory. Assuming there
does not exist a perfect matching in the corresponding bipartite
graph of , there does not exist positive entries in
that no two entries in the same column or row. According to the
König theorem [24], [25], we can cover all of the positive entries
in the matrix with rows and columns, such that .
However, since the sum of all lines of is equal to 1, it
follows . This contradicts to the assumption.
Lemma 1 is proved.
Theorem 1: The DecomposeMatrix-nn algorithm can always
find a perfect matching so long as there are edges in .
Proof: For any workload matrix , according to (11),
we have for , . According to Lemma 1,
there exists a perfect matching on the corresponding bipartite
graph .
Since in each round , the DecomposeMatrix-nn algorithm
computes a perfect matching and deducts from the weight
of the edges in the perfect matching. It is equivalent to
deducting a schedule matrix from the workload matrix
. Thus, the resulting matrix (after deducting )
still holds the condition for , . According
to Lemma 1, there exists a perfect matching on in every
round of the decomposition process. This process stops at
the last round where all the remaining edges in make up
an exact perfect matching, and they are all removed at this
last round. Theorem 1 is proved.
The following theorem states that the number of decomposi-
tion rounds can be bounded by using the DecomposeMatrix-nn
algorithm.
Theorem 2: The workload matrix can be exactly decomposed
into a sequence of schedule matrices by using the Decompose-
Matrix-nn algorithm and the time complexity is ,
where is the number of non-zero elements in .
Proof: According to theorem 1, a perfect matching can be
found in at each round of decomposition until there is no edge
left in .
Since at each time of finding a perfect matching, at least one
edge in is removed. Therefore, it takes at most number
of rounds to remove all edges in , where is the number
of edges in , which is the number of non-zero elements in
. Furthermore, it takes to find a perfect matching
if we use depth-first search [26]. So the total time complexity is
. Theorem 2 is proved.
Thus, the workload matrix can be successfully decomposed
into a sequence of schedule matrices when , where ,
are the number of sensors and the number of targets, respec-
tively. In Section IV-B5, we will discuss the general cases of
and propose a complete decomposition algorithm.
2) General Case : When , our idea is to trans-
form the case to by introducing some dummy targets
into the system. That is to “fill” the matrix with some
dummy columns to make it a square matrix of order , such
that the sum of all elements in each row is equal to the sum of
all elements in each column.
Let be the dummy matrix, which has
columns. By appending the columns of the dummy matrix to
the right hand side of , the resulting matrix, denoted by
, is in the form
To make matrix having the features of (7) and (10),
i.e., the sum of each column is equal to the sum of each row and
equal to , the dummy matrix should satisfy the
following conditions:
(12)
(13)
We propose a simple algorithm to compute the dummy ma-
trix . The algorithm starts to assign values to the
elements of from its top-left corner. Let and
record the sum of the remaining undetermined elements
of row and column , respectively, for and
. Initially, and ,
where and are computed from matrix . The strategy
of the algorithm is to assign the remaining sum of the row (or
column), as much as possible, to an element without violating
conditions (12) and (13), and assign the rest elements of the row
(or column) to 0. Then, we move down to the next undetermined
element from the top-left of the matrix. For example, we start
with . Now is and is , i.e., .
Thus, we can assign to , and assign 0 to the rest of ele-
ments of row 1 (so condition (12) is met). Then, should be
updated to , because the remaining sum of column
1 now becomes and this value is used to ensure that
condition (13) will be met during the process. Suppose we now
come to element , (i.e., elements of , for
and , are already determined so far). We com-
pare with . There are three cases:
1) : it means can use up the remaining value the
sum of row , i.e., . Thus, and the rest ele-
ments of this row should be assigned to 0. So, all elements
of row have been assigned and condition (12) is met for
row .
2) : it means can use up the remaining value
the sum of column , i.e., . Thus, and the
rest elements of this column should be assigned to 0, i.e.,
, . By doing so, all elements of
column have been assigned and condition (13) is met for
column .
3) : we can determine elements in both row and
column by and setting the rest elements in row
and in column to 0. It is easy to see that condition (12)
is met for row and condition (13) is met for column .
After determining each row (or column), we need to update
(or ), before moving to the next row (or column). Each
step, we can determine the elements in one row (or column).

Thus, the case of can be transformed to the case of

Theorem 5: The total time complexity of the DecomposeMa-

Proof: According to Theorem 2 and Theorem 4, this the-
orem is proved.
Given a workload matrix , using the proposed algo-
rithm, we can fill the matrix to make it a square matrix
and decompose into a sequence of schedule matrices as
follows:
(14)
Let denote the matrix which contains the first columns
in (i.e., the information for the valid targets by dropping
the dummy columns), . By removing the
dummy columns in , we have
(15)
The above discussions conclude that a workload matrix is
decomposable to a sequence of schedule matrices such that each
value of , , , can be actually met. In
Section IV-C, we will determine a sensor surveillance tree for
each schedule matrix that specifies the routes for active sensors
to pass sensed data to the BS, such that the maximal lifetime
can be finally achieved.
C. Determine Surveillance Tree
We have obtained a sequence of schedule matrices. Each
schedule matrix specifies the active sensors watching targets for
a period of time (called a session). To allow the active sensors
send their sensed data to the BS at each session, we need to
construct a sensor surveillance tree whose root is the BS and
all leaf nodes are the active sensors. The sensed data flow from
active sensors to the BS along the tree. Some active sensors can
perform both duties of watching targets and forwarding data
for other sensors at the same time.
From computing the LP formulation in Section IV-A, we have
obtained a data flow from any sensor node to sensor node
. To forward data to the BS, each sensor node, say , needs to
follow its outgoing flow in order to achieve the maximal life-
time . Suppose sensor has downstream nodes, denoted by
, to forward its data to the BS (i.e.,
have non-zero values). Since there is no ordering of data flow
, we simply let sensor forward its outgoing data
first to until flow is saturated, then switch to until the
value of is met, and finally forward the last flow to .
The outgoing data of sensor include its own sensed data and
the data it helps others to forward to the BS. By following the
data flow obtained from the LP formulation in forwarding data
to the BS, the optimal routes, in terms of energy cost, are used
and thus the maximal lifetime is achieved.
In the sensor surveillance system, after computing the
schedule matrices and the data flow, the BS will disseminate
this schedule and flow to sensor nodes at the system initial-
ization stage. After the system starts operation, each sensor
will watch targets, turn off to sleep, receive and forward data
according to its own schedule. There is no need to coordinate
with others to switch target watching at the end of each ses-
sion. In fact, a sensor does not see sessions. When a sensor
is required to watch the same target for several consecutive
sessions, its schedule would specify this sensor to watch the
target continuously until it is time to turn itself off or switch to
another target. Thus, each sensor works according to its own
schedule independently from the others.
The sensors work by their own schedule based on their local
clocks. The clocks on the sensors will drift away from each other
from time to time. To ensure a target will be watched by another
sensor continuously before the current one switched off, clocks
of the sensors need to be synchronized. There are some clock
synchronization protocols [27] for sensor networks, including
some localized methods [28], and they have bounded errors for
clock synchronization. When scheduling sensors to watch tar-
gets, the system can add a small buffer-period (in the order of
milliseconds depending on the clock error) in the front and at the
end of a working session to ensure that a target will be watched
continuously at sensor switching. Notice that compared with the
duration of a working session the buffer-period is several orders
of magnitude smaller.
V. EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATIONS
A. A Numeric Example
We randomly place a BS, six sensors (uncolored in Fig. 2) and
three targets (gray in Fig. 2) in a 10 10 two-dimensional free-
space region. For simplicity, the surveillance range of sensors
is set to 0.4 10, and the maximal transmission range of all
sensors is set to 0.8 10 (our solution can work for systems
with non-uniform maximal transmission ranges or surveillance
ranges). Fig. 2 shows neighbors of sensors and the surveillance
relationship between sensors and targets. An edge between a
sensor and a target represents the target is within the surveillance
range of the sensor. An arc from sensor to represents
is within the maximal transmission range of (in this example,
maximal transmission ranges for all sensors are uniform, so arcs
are replaced by edges in Fig. 2). The initial energy reserves of
sensors are random numbers generated in the range of
342 IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING, VOL. 15, NO. 2, APRIL 2007
Finally, the surveillance trees based on the above schedule
matrices and data flows are determined. The surveillance trees
for three sessions are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c).
It is easy to see that the surveillance trees in Fig. 3(a)–(c) sat-
isfy both the surveillance requirement and data flow constraints.
The maximal lifetime is actually achieved.
B. Simulations
We conduct simulations to study the complexity of our
proposed solution and compare its performance with a greedy
method.
The simulations are conducted in a 100 100 two-dimen-
sional free-space region. BS, sensors and targets are randomly
distributed inside the region. Again, the surveillance range
and the maximal transmission range of all sensors are set to
0.4 100 and 0.8 100, respectively (except the simulations
for Fig. 5(a) and (b). The signal decline factor and the
initial energy reserves of sensors are the random numbers in
the range of , with the mean value of 50. The linear
programming formulated in Section IV-A is computed by using
MatLab 6.5. The results presented in the figures are the means
of 100 separate runs.
1) Linear Growth of Decomposition Steps: According to
Theorem 2, we know the number of steps for decomposing the
workload matrix, , is bounded by . In the simulations,
we found that is linear to the size of the system.
Fig. 4(a) and (b) shows the increase of versus the change of
(number of sensors) and (number of targets), respectively,
when one of the two variables is fixed. From the figures, we can
see a strong linear relationship between and (or ). This
result tells us that the actual number of steps for decomposing
the matrix is linear to the size of system in real runs.
2) Comparison With a Greedy Method: A greedy algorithm
is proposed to compare the performance with our optimal solu-
tion. The basic idea of the greedy method is as follows. Each
time, we find a sensor to watch each target. We use the max-
imum matching algorithm in the sensor-target bipartite graph to
find the pairs of sensor and target. Then, for each sensor sched-
uled to work in this session we find the minimal energy cost path
from it to the BS in the sensor network graph (the sensor inter-
connectivity graph). When any node that is either in watching a
target or in the path runs out of energy, it is removed from the
bipartite graph and the network graph, and another maximum
matching and routes are computed. This operation is repeated
until no maximum matching can be found to cover all targets
or there no longer exists a path from a sensor to BS cannot be
found. The system lifetime of the greedy method is the total ser-
vice time.
We set and . Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the
lifetime versus the change of surveillance range and the max-
imal transmission range of sensors, respectively. From the fig-
ures, we can see that when the surveillance range (the maximal
transmission range) becomes larger, the performance gap be-
comes more significant. This is because with a small surveil-
lance range (maximal transmission range), sensors have only
got a few targets (sensors) within its surveillance range (max-
imal transmission range). There is little room for optimization.

As the surveillance range (the maximal transmission range) be-
comes larger, more sensors are able to cover multiple targets
(sensors), which gives our method more room to schedule the

3) The increase of surveillance range is more effective to ex-
tending the system lifetime than the increase of the max-
imal transmission range of sensors.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have presented the maximal lifetime scheduling problem
in sensor surveillance systems. This is the first time in the liter-
ature that the problem of maximizing lifetime of sensor surveil-
lance systems was formulated and the optimal solution was ob-
tained. Simulations have been conducted to show the superior
performance of our method in comparison with a greedy sched-
uling method under various network scenarios.
There is some related work in the literature about scheduling
of sensors in surveillance systems. A notable work in [30] dis-
cusses the problem of selecting a minimum number of con-
nected sensors to cover a given set of interested points (tar-
gets). However, operating with the minimal number of sensors
does not simply imply the maximal lifetime of the system. It is
because that without global optimization, some nodes that can
cover many targets could be scheduled to work heavily and they
will quickly run out of energy. Another work is a sensing pro-
tocol proposed in [2]. It discusses a sensor coverage problem,
which is to schedule a set of sensors to work and sleep in turn,
such that a given area can be fully covered by working sensors
at any time and the lifetime of the system is maximized. The
method used to cover an area is to divide the area into grid, and
it is defined that the entire area is covered if all the grid points are
covered. A sensor can cover multiple grid points simultaneously
if all the grid points are within the sensing range of this sensor.
The schedule algorithm is centered with grid points. That is, for
each grid point, its watching time is split among the sensors that
are able to watch it. This is a localized scheduling method. But,
it is not an optimal method and there is no performance guar-
antee of this method. Moreover, none of the work in [2] and
[30] considered the communication cost of sending data from
sensors to base stations. According to our experience, a greedy
schedule algorithm [31] (similar to the scheduling method in
[2]) could perform very badly when taking communication cost
into account.

On the Longest Edge of Gabriel Graphs
in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
Peng-Jun Wan and Chih-Wei Yi, Member, IEEE
Abstract—In wireless ad hoc networks, without fixed infrastructures, virtual backbones are constructed and maintained to efficiently
operate such networks. The Gabriel graph (GG) is one of widely used geometric structures for topology control in wireless ad hoc
networks. If all nodes have the same maximal transmission radii, the length of the longest edge of the GG is the critical transmission
radius such that the GG can be constructed by localized and distributed algorithms using only 1-hop neighbor information. In this
paper, we assume a wireless ad hoc network is represented by a Poisson point process with mean n on a unit-area disk, and nodes
have the same maximal transmission radii. We give three asymptotic results on the length of the longest edge of the GG. First, we
show that the ratio of the length of the longest edge to
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

is asymptotically almost surely equal to 2. Next, we show that for any ,
the expected number of GG edges whose lengths are at least 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
lnnþ
n
q
is asymptotically equal to 2e. This implies that !1 is an
asymptotically almost sure sufficient condition for constructing the GG by 1-hop information. Last, we prove that the number of long
edges is asymptotically Poisson with mean 2e. Therefore, the probability of the event that the length of the longest edge is less

1 INTRODUCTION
A wireless ad hoc network is a collection of wirelessdevices (transceivers) distributed over a geographic
region. Each node is equipped with an omnidirectional
antenna and has limited transmission power. A communica-
tion session is established either through a single-hop radio
transmission if the communication parties are close enough,
or through relaying by intermediate devices otherwise. Since
they have no need for a fixed infrastructure, wireless ad hoc
networks can be flexibly deployed at low cost for varying
missions such as decision making in the battlefield, emer-
gency disaster relief, and environmental monitoring.
Inwireless adhocnetworks, each node is associatedwith a
maximal transmission radius. The network topology of a
wireless ad hoc network is a graph in which two nodes have
an edge between them if they are within each other’s
transmission range. A spanner is a subset of the network
topology in which the total cost, e.g., distance or energy
consumption, between any pair of nodes is only a constant
fact larger than in the original network topology. Hence,
spanners are good candidates of virtual backbones. The
topics about how to construct and maintain spanners are
called topology control. Geometric structures, including
Euclideanminimal spanning trees (EMST), relative neighbor
graphs (RNG), Gabriel graphs (GG), Delauney triangulations
(DT), and Yao’s graphs (YG), are widely used ingredients for
constructing spanners [1], [2], [3]. A topology control
algorithm is localized if each node only needs to collect
information from few hops neighbors.
In this paper, we study the critical transmission radius
for Gabriel graphs. In the GG, two nodes have an edge
between them if and only if there is no other node on the
disk using the segment of these two nodes as its diameter.
Assume all nodes have the same maximal transmission
radius r. Then, the induced network topology is exactly the
r-disk graph over the set of nodes V , denoted by GrðV Þ. To
construct the GG only by 1-hop neighbor information, the
transmission radius r should be large enough such that the
GG is a subgraph of the r-disk graph. Thus, the transmission
radius should be not less than the length of the longest edge
of the GG. On the other hand, for each node, if it can gather
the information of nodes that are not farther than its farthest
neighbor in the GG, it can decide all GG edges incident to it.
Therefore, the length of the longest edge of the GG is called
the critical transmission radius for GGs.
For modeling radio networks, Gilbert [4] proposed a
random geometric graph model in which devices are
represented by an infinite random point process over the
entire plane and twodevices are joined by an edge if and only
if their distance is at most r. For modeling wireless ad hoc
networks which consist of finite radio nodes in a bounded
geographic region, a bounded (or finite) variant of the
Gilbert’s model has been used by Gupta and Kumar [5] and
others. In this variant, instead of an infinite random point
process, the ad hoc device is typically presented by a uniform
point process or Poisson point process over a disk or a square
by proper scaling. The largest nearest-neighbor link problem

Put all together, and the lemma is proved. tu
Lemmas 16 and 17, respectively, give lower and upper
bounds for the length of the longest Gabriel edge. Hence,
Theorem 1 is now an immediate consequence of Lemmas 16
and 17.
5 EXPECTED NUMBER OF LONG EDGES
In the previous section, we proved that the ratio of the
length of the longest Gabriel edge to

In this section, we are going to prove Theorem 2, which
gives the expectation of the number of long Gabriel edges.

Y

fx1; x2g; V Þ ¼ 1 only if kx1  x2k  r and there is no
other node of V in the disk area Dx1x2 ; otherwise,
hrðY ; V Þ ¼ 0. Let X1 and X2 denote independent random
points with uniform distribution over D and indepen-
dent of Pn. According to the Palm theory,

for some sequence n such that n !1,
n ¼ oðlnnÞ, and mðnÞ ¼ nðn 1Þ=2. For applying Theorem
10 (Brun’s sieve) to prove Theorem 3, let Bi be the event that
the edge between the ith pair of nodes is a Gabriel edge
whose length is at least r but less than Rn for
1  i  mðPoðnÞÞ, and Y be the number of Bi that holds.
Then, Y is exactly the number of Gabriel edges whose
lengths are at least r ¼ 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
lnnþ
n
q
but less than Rn. According
to Theorem 2, Y is a.a.s. equal to the number of Gabriel
edges whose length is at least r.
For any fixed integer k, let K1 denote the collection of set
fi1;    ; ikg 
 f1;    ;mðPoðnÞÞg such that ei1 ;    ; eik are not
incident to the same nodes, and K2 be the collection of set
fi1;    ; ikg 
 f1;    ;mðPoðnÞÞg such that ei1 ;    ; eik have
some common endpoints. Then,

In Lemma 18, we shall prove that the expectation of the sum

Lemma 19, we shall prove that the expectation of the sum
over fi1;    ; ikg 2 K2 are asymptotically equal to zero.
Therefore, Theorem 3 follows Lemmas 18 and 19 by
applying Theorem 10.
In the proofs of Lemmas 18 and 19, for applying the Palm
theory, let X l ¼ fX1;    ; Xlg denote a uniform l-points
process over D and independent of Pn, and Bi be the event
that the edge between the ith pair of nodes of X l is a Gabriel
edge over X l [ Pn whose length is at least r but less than
Rn for 1  i  mðlÞ. In addition, let ei denote the edge of
X2i1X2i (or x2i1x2i), zi ¼ x2i1þx2i2 be the midpoint of edge
ei, and ri ¼ k x2i1x2i2 k be the radius of Dx2i1x2i . keik is
shorthand for kx2i1  x2ik, i.e., the length of edge ei.

7 CONCLUSION
The Gabriel graph is one of the widely used geometric
structures in topology control of wireless ad hoc networks
and can be constructed by distributed and localized
algorithms. If all nodes have the same transmission radii,
the maximal length of Gabriel edges is the smallest transmis-
sion radius for constructing the GG by only 1-hop neighbor
information. In this paper, we assume a wireless ad hoc
network is represented by a Poisson point processwithmean
n on a unit-area disk. We first showed that the ratio of the
maximal length of Gabriel edges to
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
lnn
n
q
is a.a.s. equal to 2.
Next,weproved that, for any constant , the expectednumber
of long Gabriel edges, whose lengths are at least 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
lnnþ
n
q
, is
a.a.s. equal to 2e. This implies that, if  !1, it is a.a.s. that
themaximal length is less than 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
lnnþ
n
q
. Last, we proved that
the number of long Gabriel edges is asymptotically Poisson
with mean 2e. Therefore, the probability of the event that
the maximal length of Gabriel edges is less than 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
lnnþ
n
q
is
asymptotically equal to expð2eÞ.
APPENDIX
First, we give two technical lemmas. Assume S and T are
two convex compact sets, and @S and @T intersect only at
two points x and y. Let u and v be two points to the different
side of xy such that uv and xy are perpendicular. T 0 is
obtained by shifting T away from S along uv by distance
4t. Then, we have the following lemma:
Lemma 20. If the boundaries ofS andT atx and y can be expressed
by continue functions along the axis parallel to uv, then
jS [ T 0j  jS [ T j ¼ ðkx yk þ o ð1ÞÞ 4t:
Proof. For convenience, assume v is on T . After shifting T
apart from S by 4t, x, y, and v on T are moved to x0, y0
and v0 respectively. See Fig. 5. Then, jS [ T 0j  jS [ T j is
equal to the area of the shaded region between xy and
x0y0. Since the boundaries can be expressed by continue
functions, the height of the shaded region can be
estimated by kx yk þ oð1Þ. The distance between xy
and x0y0 is equal to 4t. So, the area of the shaded region
can be expressed by ðkx yk þ oð1ÞÞ4t. tu
Lemma 21. Assume R is a constant, 12R  r2  r1  R, and
kx2  x1k 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
r21  r22
p
. Let t ¼ kx2  x1k and fðtÞ ¼
jBðx2; r2Þ nBðx1; r1Þj. Then,
fðtÞ  0:16Rt:
Proof. Assume r1 is fixed. If t < r1 þ r2, let y1y2 be the
common chord of @Bðx1; r1Þ and @Bðx2; r2Þ. See Fig. 6a.

Abstract
The concept of the forwarding set has been used exten-
sively by many broadcast protocols in wireless ad hoc net-
works to alleviate the broadcast storm problem. In these
protocols, when a node receives a broadcast, it only in-
structs a subset of its neighbors, a.k.a. the forwarding set,
to relay the message. In this paper, we propose to use the lo-
cal minimum disk cover set as the forwarding set in hetero-
geneous wireless ad hoc networks, where nodes may have
different transmission radius. We show that the minimum
local disk cover set of a node is equivalent to its skyline set,
and propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm with the opti-
mal time complexity O (n logn) to compute the skyline set
locally and statelessly.
1. Introduction
A wireless ad hoc network consists of a collection of
wireless devices networked together in multi-hop fashion.
It has been adopted by many applications, such as environ-
mental monitoring, battlefield surveillance, and emergency
disaster relief. Network-wide broadcasting is one of the
fundamental operations in wireless ad hoc networks. It is
widely and frequently used to explore the network topol-
ogy, discover routing paths, and monitor network integrity.
Flooding, the most known broadcasting mechanism, is to
let every device retransmit a broadcast when it receives the
message the first time. Despite its simplicity, flooding tends
to generate too many unnecessary retransmissions, which
in turn causes message collisions and channel contention.
This issue is known as the broadcast storm problem [3].
To address this issue, alternative broadcasting algorithms
[1, 2, 4] have been proposed. In these algorithms, when a

No. NSC95-2221-E-009-059-MY3, by MOE ATU Program, and by Intel
JRP.
node receives a broadcast, it selects a subset of neighbors,
referred as the forwarding set or multipoint relaying set, to
relay the message. To ensure that a broadcast can reach all
nodes in the network, nodes in the forwarding set of a node
should cover all its 2-hop neighbors. At the same time, to
better relieve the broadcast storm problem, the forwarding
set should be kept as small as possible.
In [5], Sun et al. proposed constructing the forwarding
set based on the coverage area of 1-hop neighbors. The idea
behind it is to ensure nodes in the forwarding set of a node
to cover the same area as all its 1-hop neighbors. The pro-
posed algorithm is localized, distributed, and with the op-
timal time complexity O(nlogn). However, the algorithm
works only when all nodes in the network have the same
transmission radius. In this paper, we extend the work to
heterogeneous networks in which nodes may have different
transmission radius. We propose a localized algorithm to
compute our forwarding set and prove our algorithm is also
with the optimal time complexity O(nlogn).
2. Minimum Local Disk Cover Sets
To alleviate the broadcast storm problem associated with
broadcast protocols, the size of the forwarding set needs to
be reduced. On the other hand, to ensure a broadcast can
reach all nodes in the network, the selection of the forward-
ing set at each node should guarantee that the message will
reach all its 2-hop neighbors.
We assume that wireless nodes are distributed in the two-
dimensional plane R2. The topology of a heterogeneous
ad hoc network is modeled by a disk graph. Each node u i
is associated with a transmission radius ri. Two nodes ui,
uj are said to be neighbors if and only if their Euclidean
distance ‖ui − uj‖ is not larger than min(ri, rj). For a
node ui, its coverage is modeled as a disk with center ui
and radius ri, which is denoted as B(ui, ri). A node uj
is said to be covered by ui if uj ∈ B(ui, ri). The topo-
logical boundary of a set S ⊂ R2 is denoted by ∂S, and

, where uj and ruj are
the center and radius of the disc contribut-
ing the arc, and αi and αi+1 are angles corre-
sponding to a and b observed at o.
Theorem 3 For a given local set V = {u0, u1, . . . , un},
its minimum local disk cover set is the sky-
line set for the corresponding local disk set
{B(u0, r0), B(u1, r1), . . . , B(un, rn)}.
Proof. To prove that the skyline set is the mini-
mum local disk cover set of a local set, we first prove
that the skyline set is a local disk cover set. Assume a
skyline is composed of arcs a1b1, a2b2, . . . , akbk belong-
ing to B (ui1 , ri1 ) , B (ui2 , ri2 ) , . . . , B (uik , rik), respec-
tively. Let oajbj denote the sector area surrounded
by line segments oaj , obj , and arc ajbj . The cov-
ered area
⋃n
i=0 B (ui, ri) is equal to the union of sec-
tors
⋃k
j=1 oajbj . According to Lemma 1, for each
skyline arc ajbj , we have oajbj ⊆ B
(
uij , rij
)
.
Thus,
⋃n
i=0B (ui, ri) ⊆
⋃k
j=1 B
(
uij , rij
)
. This
means {B (ui1 , ri1) , B (ui2 , ri2) , . . . , B (uik , rik )} is a
disk cover set.
Next, we prove that if B (ui, ri) is in the skyline set,
B (ui, ri) must be in any disk cover set. To prove this,
we are going to show there exists some area belonging to
B (ui, ri) but not belonging to any other disk. Assume
a is a point in the internal of the skyline arc contributed
by B (ui, ri). See Fig. 3. For any j = i, we have
‖uj − a‖ > rj . Let r = 12 (minj =i ‖uj − a‖ − rj). For
any x ∈ B (a, r) and j = i,
‖uj − x‖ ≥ ‖uj − a‖ − ‖x− a‖
≥ ‖uj − a‖ − 12
(
min
j =i
‖uj − a‖ − rj
)
> ‖uj − a‖ − (‖uj − a‖ − rj)
= rj .

Figure 3. B (a, r)∩B (ui, ri) is exclusively cov-
ered by B(ui, ri).
Thus, for any j = i, B (a, r)∩B (uj, rj) = ∅. This implies
that B (a, r) ∩ B (ui, ri) belongs to B (ui, ri) but does not
belong to any other disk. So the theorem is proved.
3.2. A Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm
According to Theorem 3, computing the MLDCS of a
local set is the same as finding the skyline set of the cor-
responding local disk set. In this subsection, a divide-and-
conquer algorithm is proposed to find the skyline set. Re-
cursively, the disk set is divided into two subsets of disks.
After skylines of both subsets are computed by recursive
calls, they are merged to find the skyline of all disks. Note
that the position of n0 (i.e., o) and the value r0 are stored
by global variables used in the Merge procedure.

not true in general. However, if the disks are added into the
disk set follows the descending order of radius, the claim
will be true. Since the order to add disks into the disk set
should not change the final skyline, in what follows, we as-
sume disks are added to the disk set in the decreasing order
of the radius. Due to the limitation on the paper length, we
give the following three lemmas without proof.
Lemma 5 In the skyline of {B1, B2, . . . , Bn}, if Bn con-
tributes at least three arcs, then we can pick Bi, Bj , Bk
from B1, B2, . . . , Bn−1 such that Bn contributes three arcs
in the skyline of Bi, Bj, Bk, Bn.
Lemma 6 Assume two circle ∂B1 and ∂B2 have two inter-
section points a and d. Let ac′ (and ab′, respectively) be
a diameters of B1 (and B2, respectively), and c (and b, re-
spectively) is a point in arc c′d (b′d respectively). See Fig.
5. If the angle ∠cab is obtuse, we have

‖b − c‖ > 2min (r1, r2) .
Lemma 7 Given an acute or right triangle, for each edge
of the triangle, draw a circle with the edge as a chord whose
center is outside the triangle and radius is larger than the
circumradius. Then, three circles have no intersection.
The following is the lemma used in the proof of Theorem
3.
Lemma 8 The number of arcs in a skyline of n disks is at
most 2n.
Proof. We prove this by mathematical induction on n.
Without loss of generality, we may assume all n nodes have
arcs in the skyline and B1, B2, · · · , Bn have been sorted
according to their radii in decreasing ordering.
If n = 1, there is only one disk, and thus, the skyline
consists of one arc. If n = 2, two disks intersect at 2 points.
There are at most 2 arcs in the skyline. See Fig. 6(a). If
n = 3, the topology can be categorized into 2 configura-
tions, like Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(c). Fig. 6(b) illustrates one
configuration in which each disk contains one intersection
point of the other two disks, and the skyline is composed of
3 arcs. Fig. 6(c) illustrates the other configuration in which
(c)(a) (b)

at most. (a) Two disks, (b) and (c) three disks.
one disk contains two intersection points of the other two
disks. In addition, 3 disks is allowed to have a common
intersection point like Fig. 7. The skyline is composed of
Figure 7. 3 disks have a common intersection
point.
either 3 or 4 arcs. No matter how, the number of arcs is no
more than 2n.
Now, assume that as n = k, the skyline contains at
most 2k arcs. If we can show that after a disk Bk+1 is
added into the set, the number of arcs in the skyline in-
creases at most by two, then the new skyline contains no
more than 2 (k + 1) arcs, and the proof is complete. With-
out loss of generality, we may assume Bk+1 is the disk with
the smallest radius among B0, B1, B2, . . . , Bk+1 since it
doesn’t change the skyline. We denote the number of arcs
in the skyline of B1, B2, . . . , Bk as Sky(B1, B2, . . . , Bk).
Now, we are going to prove this by contradiction. Assume
Bk+1 can contribute at least 3 arcs. According to Lemma 5,
without loss of generality, we may assume that Bk+1 con-
tributes 3 arcs in the skyline of B1, B2, B3, Bk+1. Accord-
ing to the two possible configurations of B1, B2, B3 like
Fig. 6(b) or Fig. 6(c), we discuss the problem in the two
cases.
First, we consider the configuration like Fig. 6(b). Let
a be the intersection point of B1 and B2 not in B3; b be
the intersection point of B1 and B3 not in B2; and c be
the intersecting point of B2 and B3 not in B1. In order
to contribute 3 arcs, Bk+1 must intersect with 3 disks and
contain a, b, c. Now, the problem is discussed by following

In what follows, o is origin of the Euclidean plane R2, and
D is the unit-area (closed) disk centered at o. We assume
that Pn is the Poisson point process over D with density
n. We denote by Xn = (X1, · · · , Xn) the uniform n-point
process over D. The symbols O, o,∼ always refer to the
limit n → ∞. To avoid trivialities, we tacitly assume n to
be sufficiently large if necessary. For simplicity of notation,
the dependence of sets and random variables on n will be
frequently suppressed. The Euclidean norm of a point x is
denoted by ‖x‖, and the Euclidean distance between two
points u and v is denoted by ‖uv‖. The Lebesgue measure
(or area) of a measurable set A ⊂ R2 is denoted by |A|. The
topological boundary of a set A ⊂ R2 is denoted by ∂A.
The open (respectively, closed) disk of radius r centered at
x is denoted by D (x, r) (respectively, D (x, r)). Through-
out of this paper, we fix a sequence of numbers (cn : n ≥ 1)
satisfying that cn →∞ but cn = o

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we present several useful geometric results. In
Section 3, we derive the limits of some relevant integrals.
In Section 4, we give the proof for Theorem 1. Finally we
conclude this paper in Section 5 with a conjecture on the
precise asymptotic value of Pr [σn ≤ rn].
2. GEOMETRIC PRELIMINARIES
For x ∈ D, let t (x) denote the distance between x and ∂D,
which is equal to 1√
pi
− ‖x‖. For any 0 < ρ < 1√
pi
, define
Dρ (0) = {x ∈ D : t (x) ≥ ρ} ,
Dρ (1) =
{
x ∈ D :
√
1
pi
− ρ2 ≤ t (x) < ρ
}
,
Dρ (2) =
{
x ∈ D : t (x) <
√
1
pi
− ρ2
}
.
With this notation, the midpoint of any line segment xy ⊂ D
is not in D‖xy‖/2 (2). For x ∈ D and 0 < ρ < 1√pi , define
θ (x, ρ) as follows. If x ∈ Dρ (0), then θ (x, ρ) = 2pi. If
x ∈ Dρ (2), then θ (x, ρ) = 0. If x ∈ Dρ (1), let u and
v be the two intersection points of ∂B (x, ρ) and ∂D, and
define θ (x, ρ) = 2pi − ∠uxv (see Figure 1). We claim that
ρθ (x, ρ) ≤ 2pit (x). The claim holds trivially if x ∈ Dρ (0)
or x ∈ Dρ (2). So, we consider the case that x ∈ Dρ (1). It’s
easy to see that θ (x, ρ) ≤ 4 arcsin t(x)
ρ
. Using the equality
α ≤ pi
2
sinα for any α ∈ [0, pi/2], we obtain
θ (x, ρ) ≤ 4 · pi
2
· t (x)
ρ
=
2pit (x)

.
Thus,
ρθ (x, ρ) ≤ 2pit (x) .

Figure 1: If x ∈ Dρ (1), then θ (x, ρ) = 2pi − 2∠uxv.
Let x and y be two distinct points in the plane. Define
L (x, y) = D (x, ‖xy‖) ∩D (y, ‖xy‖) .
The set L (x, y) is called the lune of x and y; the segment
xy is called the waist of L (x, y); the two intersection points
of ∂D (x, ‖xy‖) and ∂D (y, ‖xy‖) are called the vertices of
L (x, y). It’s easy to verify that
|L (x, y)| = pi ‖xy‖2 /β0.
Suppose that 0 < r ≤ ‖xy‖. Define
Lr (x, y) = D (x, r) ∩D (y, ‖xy‖) .
The set Lr (x, y) is called a quasi-lune; the segment xy is also
called the waist of Lr (x, y); the two intersection points of
∂D (x, r) and ∂D (y, ‖xy‖) are called the vertices of Lr (x, y).
It’s easy to verify that
|Lr (x, y)|

2 ‖xy‖ + r

.
Let y′ be the point on the segment xy satisfying that ‖xy′‖ =
r. Then,
L
(
x, y′
) ⊆ Lr (x, y) ⊆ L (x, y) .
Lemma 2. If r < ‖xy‖ ≤ 1.1r, then
|L (x, y) \ Lr (x, y)| ≤ pi
2.7
(‖xy‖2 − r2) .
If ‖xy‖ ≥ 1.05r and y′ is the point on the segment xy satis-
fying that ‖xy′‖ = r, then,
|Lr (x, y)| ≥ 1.01
∣∣L (x, y′)∣∣ .
Proof. Let v be a vertex of Lr (x, y) (see Figure 2).
Then,
∠vxy = arccos r
2 ‖xy‖ ≤ arccos
1
2.2
≤ pi
2.7
.
So,
|L (x, y) \ Lr (x, y)|
≤ (‖xy‖2 − r2) · ∠vxy
≤ pi
2.7
(‖xy‖2 − r2) .

Lemma 4. Consider a line segment xy ⊂ D with ‖xy‖ <

√
pi. Let z be the midpoint of xy. If t (z) ≤
√

‖xy‖, then
for any 2

‖xy‖ < r ≤ ‖xy‖,
|Lr (x, y) ∩ D| ≥ 1

|Lr (x, y)|+ r

t (z) .
Proof. Let u and u′ be the two vertices of L (x, y) with
u being farther away from the center of D (see Figure 3).
Then, the half lune xyu′ of L (x, y)is fully contained in D.
Let v and v′ be the two vertices of Lr (x, y) with v lying on
the same side of xy as u. Then, the half of Lr (x, y) which
is on the same side of xy as v′ is also fully contained in D.
Let w be intersection point of uz and ∂Lr (x, y). Then,

If w ∈ D, then the triangle xy′w is contained in D and its

Now assume that w /∈ D. Let q be the intersection point

and its area is r

3. INTEGRAL INGREDIENTS
Let
Ω =
{
(x1, x2) ∈ D2 : rn < ‖x1x2‖ ≤ R′n
}
.
For any β > β0, define γ(β) =
1

β
. In this section, we
will prove the following two asymptotic equalities:

∫
Ω
e−n|(Lrn (x1,x2)∪Lrn (x2,x1))∩D|dx1dx2 ∼ β0
2
e−c. (2)
We split the integral domain Ω into three subregions as
follows. For each (x1, x2) ∈ Ω, let ρ = ρ (x1, x2) be the half-
length of x1x2, and z = z (x1, x2) be the midpoint of x1x2.
Let Ω1 (respectively, Ω2) be the set of points (x1, x2) ∈ Ω
satisfying that z ∈ D√3ρ (0) and rn < ‖x1x2‖ ≤ Rn (re-
spectively, Rn < ‖x1x2‖ ≤ R′n) , and Ω3 be the set of
points (x1, x2) ∈ Ω satisfying that z /∈ D√3ρ (0). Then,
Ω1, Ω2 and Ω3 form a partition of Ω. In addition, for each
(x1, x2) ∈ Ω1∪Ω2, L (x1, x2) ⊂ D. We will prove the follow-
ing six asymptotic equalities, from which the two asymptotic
equalities (1) and (2) follow immediately:
n2
2

Ω1
e−n|Lrn (x1,x2)|dx1dx2 ∼ 1

e−n|Lrn (x1,x2)|dx1dx2 = o (1) , (5)
n2

n2
2
∫
Ω3
e−n|(Lrn (x1,x2)∪Lrn (x2,x1))∩D|dx1dx2 = o (1) . (8)
Among these six asymptotic equalities, the two asymptotic
equalities (6) and (8) are implied by the two asymptotic
equalities (5) and (7) respectively, and thus will not be fur-
ther proved. We will frequently replace the integral variables
x1 and x2 by the midpoint z, half-length ρ and the slope of
x1x2. The Jacobian determinant of this change is 4ρ.

4. PROOF FOR THEOREM 1
In this section, we prove Theorem 1 by establishing the
following two asymptotic inequalities:
Pr [σn > rn] .
(

1/β0 − 1/3 −
β0
2
)
e−c, (11)
Pr [σn ≤ rn] . e−
β0
2
e−c . (12)
We first give a brief overview on our approach to prove
the asymptotic inequality (11). Let Mn (respectively, M
′
n)
denote the number of pairs {X,Y } ⊂ Pn satisfying that
rn < ‖XY ‖ ≤ R′n (respectively, ‖XY ‖ > R′n) and either
Lrn (X,Y )∩Pn or Lrn (Y,X)∩Pn is empty. Then, σn > rn
if and only if Mn+M
′
n > 0. In Lemma 6, we will prove that
E [Mn] ∼
(
1
1/β0 − 1/3 −
β0
2
)
e−c.
By Markov’s inequality, we have
Pr [Mn > 0] ≤ E [Mn] ∼
(
1
1/β0 − 1/3 −
β0
2
)
e−c.
In Lemma 7, we will prove that M ′n = 0 is a.a.s.. Conse-
quently,
Pr [σn > rn] = Pr
[
Mn +M
′
n > 0
] ∼ Pr [Mn > 0]
.
(
1
1/β0 − 1/3 −
β0
2
)
e−c.
So, the asymptotic inequality (11) holds.
The key technique for computing the asymptotic value of
E [Mn] is the Palm theory for Poisson processes (see, e.g.,
Theorem 1.6 in [7]), which is stated below.
Theorem 5. Suppose that h (U, V ) is a bounded measur-
able function defined on all pairs of the form (U, V ) with V
being a finite planar set and U being a subset of V . Then
any positive integer k,
E

 ∑
U⊆Pn,|U|=k
h (U,Pn)

 = nk
k!
E [h (Xk,Xk∪Pn)] .
Now, we apply Palm theory to derive the asymptotic value
of E [Mn].
Lemma 6. E [Mn] ∼
(
1
1/β0−1/3 −
β0
2
)
e−c.
Proof. For any pair {Y1, Y2} ⊂ Pn, define B (Y1, Y2)
to be the Bernoulli random variable which equals to
one if and only if rn < ‖Y1Y2‖ ≤ R′n and either
Lrn (Y1, Y2)∩Pn or Lrn (Y2, Y1)∩Pn is empty. Then Mn =∑
{Y1,Y2}⊂Pn B (Y1, Y2). Let X2 = {X1, X2} and define B˜ to
be the Bernoulli random variable which equals to one if and
only if rn < ‖X1X2‖ ≤ R′n and either Lrn (X1, X2) ∩ Pn or
Lrn (X2, X1) ∩ Pn is empty. By Theorem 5, we have
E [Mn] = E

 ∑
{Y1,Y2}⊂Pn
B (Y1, Y2)

Pr
[
B˜ = 1 | X1 = x1, X2 = x2

Note that for any (x1, x2) ∈ Ω,
Pr
[
B˜ = 1 | X1 = x1, X2 = x2
]
=e−n|Lrn (x1,x2)∩D| + e−n|Lrn (x2,x1)∩D|
− e−n|(Lrn (x1,x2)∪Lrn (x2,x1))∩D|.
Thus,

where the asymptotic equality follows from the two asymp-
totic equalities (1) and (2).
Next, we will utilize the tool of minimal scan statistics
developed in [10] to prove that M ′n = 0 is a.a.s..
Lemma 7. Pr [M ′n > 0] = o (1).
Proof. For any finite point set V ⊂ D and any r > 0,
define
S (V, r) = min
{u,v}⊂D,‖uv‖=1.05r
|V ∩ Lr (u, v)| .
For any pair of {u, v} ⊂ D with ‖uv‖ = 1.05r, let v′ be
the point on uv satisfying that ‖uv′‖ = r. By Lemma 2,
|Lr (u, v)| > 1.01 |L (u, v′)|. Using this fact and following
the same argument in the proof of Lemma 9 in [10], we
can prove that S (Pn, rn) > Θ(lnn) is a.a.s.. In particular,
S (Pn, rn) > 0 a.a.s.. Next, we claim that the event M ′n > 0
