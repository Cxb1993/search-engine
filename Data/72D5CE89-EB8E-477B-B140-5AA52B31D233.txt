well known as an expensive medicinal material. 
It is commonly used as remedy for food, alcohol, 
and drug intoxication, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
hypertension, skin itching and cancer [1]. In the 
past, phytochemical investigations have resulted 
in the isolation of a series of sesquiterpene 
lactone, polysaccharides, steroids and 
triterpenoids. [2-8]. Nevertheless, systemic 
studies of the bio-function of the extracted 
ingredients were not performed until recently. 
Polysaccharide components extracted from A. 
cinnamomea mycelia have been shown 
exhibiting an anti-hepatitis B virus surface 
antigen effect [9], having pronounced anti-tumor 
effects on both in vitro and in vivo model [10], 
and displaying strong immunomodulatory and 
anti-inflammatory effects [10-11]. In this study, 
we investigate the nutritional requirements for 
submerged culture of A. cinnamomea, attempting 
to obtain optimal submerged culture conditions 
for mycellial growth and polysaccharides 
production by using response surface 
methodology. 
 
Materials and methods 
Microorganism and media—A. cinnamomea 
CCRC36716 used in this study was obtained 
from the Culture Collection and Research Center 
(CCRC) Taiwan. Inoculum preparation:PMP 
medium (2 g glucose, 2 g malt extract and 0.1 g 
peptone in 100 ml of distilled water) for seed 
culture was prepared; the pH was initially 
adjusted to 5. A. cinnamomea was transferred to 
PMP medium by punching out 0.7 mm diameter 
agar discs from culture grown on PDA plates; 5 
discs were used to inoculate 100 ml liquid media. 
The seed culture was grown in a 250-ml 
Erlenmeyer flask at 25℃ on a rotary shaker 
incubator at 100 rpm for 7 days. The culture was 
incubated at 25℃ on a rotary shaker incubator at 
150 rpm, and samples were collected at various 
intervals from the shake flasks for analyzing 
biomass dry weight and exopolysaccharides 
(EPS) production. 
 
Measurements of extracellular and intracellular 
polysaccharides--Samples collected at various 
intervals from shake flasks were centrifuged at 
6,000 rpm for 15 min, and the resulting 
supernatant was filtered through a Whatman 
filter paper. The resulting culture filtrate was 
mixed with four volumes of 95% (v/v) ethanol, 
stirred vigorously and left overnight at 4℃. The 
precipitated EPS was recovered by 
centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min and the 
supernatant was discarded. The precipitate of 
crude EPS was lyophilized and suspended in 1 M 
NaOH at 60℃ for 1 h, and reducing sugar in the 
supernatant were measured by phenol-sulfuric 
acid method [15].  
 
RSM experimental design  
Preliminary data indicated that the major 
variables affecting the performance of the culture 
in terms of EPS yields are the levels of nitrogen 
source (yeast extract), carbon source (sucrose) 
and peanutoil (peanut oil). Therefore, these three 
factors were chosen for further optimization 
through RSM. For the first phase of the 
optimization process in which the region close to 
the optimum is to be approached, two-level 
factorial designs were chosen. In this 
experimental design, the main effects and 
interactions of different factors, each at two 
different levels, can be simultaneously 
investigated. The three factors are X1 (yeast 
extract), X2 (sucrose) and X3 (peanut oil). For a 
23 fractional factorial design with seven factors 
at two levels, eight experimental runs are 
required.  
The method of steepest ascent (descent) is a 
procedure for moving sequentially along the path 
of steepest ascent (descent), that is, in the 
direction of the maximum increase (decrease) in 
the response. Based on the results obtained from 
the factorial design, the fitted first-order model is  
       Y=β0 + Σ βi xi…………......(1)           
Y is the predicted response; β0,βi, are constant 
coefficients, and xi is the coded independent 
variables or factors. 
The central composite design (CCD) was 
conducted in the optimum vicinity to locate the 
true optimum conditions of X1 (yeast extract), X2 
(sucrose) and X3 (peanut oil) for EPS production. 
For the three factors, this trial was essentially a  
23 factorial design augmented by eight axial 
points (or called star points) coded ±α and two 
replications of center point (all factors at level 0), 
resulting in a total number of  46 experiments 
[4]. The variables were coded according to the 
equation (2): 
i

−= 0   (2) 
where xi is the coded variable of a factor, Xi is

1.11X1X3 - 0.40X2X3 …………………..(4) 
Besides the linear effects, the response surface 
method also gives an insight about the 
parameters quadratic and combined effects. This 
fit of the model was checked by the coefficient 
of determination R2, which was calculated to be 
0.852, indicating that 85.20% of the variability in 
the response could be explained by the model. 
According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), 
the test statistics F values for the overall 
regression is significant at the upper 5% level, 
which further supported that the second-order 
model is very adequate in approximating the 
response surface of the experimental design. 
After performing the transformation of equation 
(4) to its canonical form, the optimum 
combination for the EPS production was found 
to be following: YE (X1) 2.63%, sucrose (X2) 
3.13% and peanut oil (X3) 0.45%. The model 
predicted a maximum response of EPS 
production at 1.88 g/L.

disease without the negative aspects of chemical control. The biological control of plant 
pathogens has become an important aspect of the sustainable agriculture. 
In the past few years, numerous microorganisms with antifungal activities and their 
antifungal factors have been identified [2, 15, 16,]; in addition, the mechanisms by which 
microorganisms inhibit growth of potentially pathogenic fungi have been demonstrated [7, 12, 
14-15, 19,]. One candidate of microbial control agents is Bacillus subtilis, a representative 
gram-positive soil bacterium [3, 14, 26]. Till now, several B. subtilis were isolated to suppress 
growth of plant pathogens; such strains and their derivatives were found to have broad 
suppressive abilities over a variety of plant pathogens in vitro [27] by producing the lipopeptide 
antibiotics iturin A and surfactin [3, 10].  
Iturin A is a cyclic lipopeptide containing a heptapeptide (L-Asn-D-Tyr-D-Asn-L-Gln 
-L-Pro-D-Asn-L-Ser) cycled with a β-amino fatty acid; it is a small molecules yet displays 
strong antifungal activity. In contrast, the other lipopeptide, surfactin which is a biosurfactant 
constituted by heptapeptide cyclised with a β-hydroxy fatty acid, has week antibiotic activity. 
The strong efficacy of iturin A against various phytopathogenic fungi is similar to the available 
chemical pesticides [27, 28]. Along with its wide spectrum of antibiotic activity and surface 
activity, iturin A confers low toxicity, low allergic effect on human and animals [6], high 
biodegradability; these characteristics qualify itself as a candidate for environmentally safe 
biological pesticide [29]. 
 
Thus far, most microbial cultivation of has been conducted in submerged fermentation 
(SMF). However, many investigators have turned their attention to the solid-sate fermentation 
owing to the fact that solid-state fermentation (SSF) offers multitude advantages over 
sub-merged fermentation in that it requires less energy for cultivation because it does not need 
any agitation unit, it can be used for treatment of solid waste and it uses less solvent for product 
extraction [1, 11]. The use of Bacillus subtilis to produce anti-fungal peptide antibiotic-iturin A 
and surfactin in solid state fermentation [2, 21, 23-25] has been studied and reported; it was 
often reported that the amount of iturin A produced per unit weight of wet substrate was five to 
ten times more than that in the submerged fermentation [21, 23]. 
 
 Previous works on iturin A fermentation were mostly conducted using " one-factor-at 
-a-time-technique". Unfortunately, it frequently fails to locate the region of optimum response 
because the joint effects of factors on the response are not taken into account in such procedure. 
It was reported that the complexities and uncertainties associated the large-scale fungi 
fermentation usually come from lack of knowledge of the sophisticated interactions among 
 4
sterilized de-ionized water to adjust the water content to 50%. To the mixture, 20% (v/w) of 
liquid seed culture was added and mixed well with a stainless steel spatula. The solid cultures 
were incubated statically at 25℃ for 5 days and the material was used for extraction of iturin A 
and analysis.  
 
2.3. Analytical methods  
2.3.1. Extraction of iturin A  
For the extraction of iturin A, 30 ml of methanol was added to 10 g of sample obtained 
from solid-state fermentation, and the mixture was shaken at 200 rpm for 1 h. The methanol 
extract obtained was centrifuged at 18,000 g at 4 ℃ for 10 min, the supernatant was filtered 
through a 0.4 um - pore-size polytetrafluoroethylene membrane (Millipore, USA) and the 
filtrate was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described 
below.  
 
2.3.2. Quantitation of iturin A by HPLC 
The HPLC system for analysis of iturin A was composed of a JASCO PU-2080 solvent 
delivery controller, a JASCO PU-2075 UV-Vis detector, and a column (Lichrospher RP-18 EC, 
4 x 250 mm, 5.0 um; Merck, Germany). The injection volume was 20 uL. The sample was 
eluted with a mobile phase comprising 10 mM ammonium sulfate/acetonitrile (3:2, v/v) at a 
flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The chromatogram was monitored at 280 nm. Iturin A standard 
obtained from Sigma Co. (USA) was used to construct a calibration curve from which iturin A 
concentration in the fermentation media was determined.  
 
2.4. RSM experimental design  
In preliminary experiments [13], various nutritional and environmental factors have been 
investigated by “one-factor-at-a-time” fashion for their suitability to sustain good production of 
iturin A by Bacillus subtilis S3.  Preliminary data indicated that the major variables affecting the 
performance of the culture in terms of iturin A yields are the levels of glucose concentration, 
KH2PO4 concentration, MgSO4 concentration, peanut oil concentration, amount of innocula, 
water content and area of aeration. Therefore, these seven factors were chosen for further 
optimization through RSM. Initially, a fractional factorial 27-4 design followed by the method of 
steepest ascent was carried out to find the general vicinity of optimum conditions for iturin A 
production.  
 
 6
X3, X4, X5, X6 were moved 0.046, 0.041, -0.099, -0.065, -1.12, -5.56 units in each step, 
respectively. These new units were determined from concentration range of unity level from 
first design and estimated coefficient ratio from equation (1). The design and experimental 
results along the path of steepest ascent is shown on Table 3. It should be noticed that the area of 
aeration was excluded in path of steepest ascent design because it showed little effect on iturin 
A production according to the results of fractional factorial experiments which will be 
described below. 
 
2.4.3. Central composite design.  
The central composite design (CCD) was conducted in the optimum vicinity to locate the 
true optimum conditions of glucose (X1), KH2PO4 (X2), MgSO4 (X3), peanut oil (X4), inocula  
(X5), water content  (X6) for iturin A production. For the six factors, this trial was essentially a  
26-1 factorial design augmented by twelve axial points (or called star points) coded ±α and two 
replications of center point (all factors at level 0), resulting in a total number of  46 experiments 
[4]. The distance of the star points from the centrepoint is given by α=2n/4 (for three factors 
n=6, α=2.378). The variables were coded according to the equation (2): 
 
i
i
i X
XXx Δ
−= 0   (2) 
where xi is the coded variable of a factor, Xi is natural variable of the factor. Xo is the value of 
the natural variable at the center point, and ∆Xi is the step change value. The variables and 
levels for the CCD are shown in the Table 4. The matrix corresponding to the CCD is shown in 
Table 5, together with the observed experimental data. The experimental results of the CCD 
were fitted with a second-order polynomial equation by a multiple regression technique.

                                 i =1            i=1                   i<j 
 
     Y is the predicted response ; β0,, βi, βii,    βij are constant coefficients, and xi, xj are the 
coded independent variables or factors. 
 
2.4.4. Software for experimental design and statistical analysis 
The computer software Statistica, version 5.0 (Statsoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK USA) was used for 
 8
CCD in the study. 
Based on the first-order model equation obtained, the path of steepest ascent was 
determined to find proper direction of changing variables increasing or decreasing the 
concentration according to the sign of the main effects to improve iturin A production. The path 
of steepest ascent started from the center of the factorial design and moved along the path in 
which the concentrations of glucose (X1), KH2PO4 (X2) and peanut oil (X4) were increasing; in 
contrast, the concentrations of MgSO4 (X3), inocula  (X5), water content  (X6) were decreasing. 
The design and results of the path of steepest ascent experiments are shown in Table 3. It is 
shown that the highest production response is 11.3 mg/g-substrate where the concentrations of 
glucose (X1), KH2PO4 (X2), MgSO4 (X3), peanut oil (X4), inocula  (X5) and water content  (X6) 
are 1.05%, 1.04mM, 4.9 mM, 1.07%, 18.88% and 44.44%, respectively. It suggested that this 
point was near the region of maximum production response.  
 
3.2. Central composite design.  
To fully explore the subregion of the response surface in the neighborhood of the optimum, 
an experimental design with more than two levels of each factor is required, so that a second 
order approximation to the response surface can be developed. A CCD with five coded levels 
was used for this purpose. The levels of the variables as shown in Table 4 for the CCD 
experiments were selected according to the results of the previous experiments. The CCD 
design and the corresponding experimental data are shown in Table 5. By applying multiple 
regression analysis on the experimental data shown in Table 5, the experimental results of the 
CCD design were fitted with a second-order polynomial equation (equation 3), and the 
second-order polynomial equation obtained for iturin A production is shown in Eq. (5).  
Second-order Model Equation 
Y (mg/g) ＝ -29.8895 ＋ 1.6301X1-5.6971X12 ＋ 7.9505X2-3.0738X22 ＋ 0.7623X3-0.1644X32 ＋

Besides the linear effects, the response surface method also gives an insight about the 
parameters quadratic and combined effects. The results of the regression analyses are shown in 
Table 6, which were done by using both Fisher's F- test and Student t-test statistical tools. The 
student t-test was used to determine the significance of the parameters regression coefficients. 
The p-values were used as a tool to check the significance of the interaction effects, which in

There were many reports on the production of lipopeptide (iturin A) by Bacillus subtilis 
species in solid-state fermentation [2, 21, 23-25]. Bacillus subtilis RB14-CS, a strain 
suppresses the growth of various plant pathogens in vitro by producing the lipopeptide 
antibiotic iturin A, produced high amount of iturin A when it was cultured using soybean curd 
residue (okara) in solid-state fermentation in that 3,300 mg/kg wet solid material (14 g/kg dry 
solid material) was produced after 4 d of fermentation, which is approximately tenfold higher 
than that in submerged fermentation [21]. Bacillus subtilis NB-22 has been investigated for the 
production of lipopeptide antibiotic in SSF of wheat bran (WB); the amount of iturin A 
produced per unit weight of wet substrate was 5-6 times more than that in the SMF. In addition, 
the extraction of procedure of iturin A from WB was much simpler than that in SMF and less 
solvent was required [22]. In the present study, the iturin A yield has increased significantly 
through application of the solid-state fermentation and RSM method; the yield of iturin A 
(11.44 mg/g-substrate) produced by B. subtilis S3 reported in this study is the highest reported 
to date for B. sublilis species in SSF. In addition, the use of rice bran as a substrate in solid-state 
fermentation for iturin A production by B. subtilis is unique.  
 
One of the objectives of biotechnology is the utilization of agricultural and food industry 
wastes for production of energy, chemicals, and protein animal feed, and at the same time 
combating pollution of the environment. Approximately 4.5 million tons of rice bran is 
produced in the world per year and their proper utilization has not been fully explored except 
for them to be used as stock feed. The effective utilization of such agricultural waste not only 
solves environmental problems, but also promotes the economic value of the agricultural 
products. These attractive characteristics further enhance the values of developing B. subtilis S3 
as bio-control agent. Although much work remains to be done before its application in the field, 
the results presented here suggests that the development of B. subtilis S3 as bio-control agents 
is an environmentally benign alternative to current disease control strategy.
