1 Introduction
The wireless communication spectrum is regulated by the government agency. It permits licensed
holders to use the spectrum in particular geographical regions. Since most of the licensed users do
not use their allocated spectrum all the time, how to make a good use the idle spectrum has become
an important issue.
The cognitive wireless network, which exploits opportunistic spectrum access to employ the
spare spectrum, has attracted a lot of attention recently [1],[2]. In a cognitive wireless network,
unlicensed users employ the licensed spectrum when licensed users are not using the spectrum and
thus improves the usage of the radio spectrum. The design of the medium access control (MAC)
protocol would greatly effect the efficiency of a network, especially for a cognitive wireless network
which does not have any guaranteed radio resource and should prevent the unlicensed users from
interfering licensed users’ access to licensed spectrum. There are three approaches to design the
MAC protocol of cognitive wireless networks: the random access approach [3],[4], time-slotted
approach [5], and the hybrid approach [6],[7] as shown in Table 1. The first approach is chiefly based
on the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). The second approach
needs time synchronization, while time is divided into slots for both common channel and data
channel transmissions. The last approach blends the characters of the other two approaches, such that
the control signal mainly occurs over synchronized time slots and data is transmitted without time
synchronization. Random access protocols, which adopts CSMA/CA, will cause a lot of contentions
and collisions, and thus need to spend more time in exchanging handshake signals and waste radio
spectrum of the cognitive wireless network. Therefore, some researches try to make a better use of
the spectrum. C-MAC [7] is one of the latest MAC protocols designed for multi-channel cognitive
wireless networks. In C-MAC, each channel is divided into several superframes as shown in Fig.2.
Only hosts using the same channel need to be synchronized; hosts using different channels need not
to be synchronized. Therefore, it can avoid wasting the radio spectrum during the Ad hoc Traffic
Indication Messages (ATIM) window and thus improves the Multi-channel MAC (MMAC) protocol
[4]. Besides, each joined host is assigned with a dedicated beacon slot such that each joined host
can use its dedicated beacon slot to transmit beacon frames to its neighbors without any contention
and collision. The major drawbacks of C-MAC are that it does not make a good use of the dedicated
beacon slot to avoid collisions of data transmissions and enhance the throughput, and it has only a
fixed number of signaling slots which may cause a long join process.
To improve C-MAC, we propose an efficient dynamic adjusting MAC (EDA-MAC) protocol
for multi-channel cognitive wireless networks. The improvements we made are listed as follows:
First, instead of a fixed number of signaling slots of C-MAC, EDA-MAC dynamically adjusts the
number of signaling slots according to the number of estimated contenders and thus reduces the
number of collisions and shortens the join process. With a faster join process, the unlicensed user
can join a communication group efficiently and can start its transmission earlier and thus improves
the throughput of the network. Second, each joined host can inform others its transmission intention
by its beacon frame. Since each joined host has a dedicated beacon slot, almost all the beacon frames
can be sent without any collision. By collecting all the information of the beacon frames, contention-
free transmissions can be made by proper scheduling in EDA-MAC. Third, the first host that scans
the spectrum and forms the communication group would become the leader. The leader is respon-
sible for coordinating the join process, data transmission, transmission rate selection, channel scan,
and channel switch of each host in the communication group. With the coordination of the leader,

2.2 C-MAC
A cognitive MAC (C-MAC) protocol for multi-channel wireless networks is proposed in [7]. In
C-MAC, each channel is divided into several superframes as shown in Fig.2. The channel with the
best quality would be regarded as the rendezvous channel. The rendezvous channel is similar to
a common control channel which can provide inter-channel synchronization, discover neighbors,
and balance load. Nodes that do not send beacons within the rendezvous channel periodically visit
the rendezvous channel to get resynchronized. This is used later on to adjust BP’s start time of all
channels so as to make them non-overlapping. Since nodes have to periodically visit the rendezvous
channel for resynchronization, they can quickly figure out information about network connectivity.
Each superframe is divided into a beacon period (BP) and a data transfer period (DTP). Each
BP contains two signaling slots and the dedicated beacon slots of the joined hosts. New arrived
hosts may contend to join the communication group during the signaling slots. When there are
many unlicensed users want to join the communication group, serious collisions may occur and thus
prolongs the join process of unlicensed users. Each joined hosts may transmit data during DTP and
detect the spectrum usage of licensed users during the quiet period (QP) in DTP.
3 Preliminary
This section presents the system model and assumptions, and then explains the motivation, the basic
idea and the main contributions of this work.
3.1 System model and assumptions
The architecture of cognitive wireless networks is shown in Fig. 3. In a cognitive wireless networks,
an unlicensed user can scan and use idle spectrum no matter they belong to licensed or unlicensed
bands. The cognitive wireless network can be either with or without infrastructure. In this project,
we focus on an cognitive wireless network without infrastructure which is based on unlicensed ad
hoc access. Before an unlicensed user starts its communications, it should join a communication
group first.

Figure 5: EDA-MAC vs. C-MAC
As Fig. 4 shows, Several communication groups may coexist in the cognitive wireless networks.
A host and its neighbors can form a communication group. To avoid interference, neighboring
groups can not use the same channel. Therefore, before using any channel, a host should listen the
channel for a superframe. A host should broadcast the channel usages of its group in its beacon
frame. A host that has joined more than one communication groups may play as the bridge for
intergroup communications.
3.2 Motivation and Basic Idea
The major drawbacks of C-MAC are that it does not make a good use of the dedicated beacon slot
to avoid collisions of data transmissions and enhance throughput, and it has only a fixed number
of signaling slots which may cause a long join process. To avoid collisions and enhance through-
put, the first host that scans the spectrums and forms the communication group would become the
leader, which is responsible for coordinating the join process, data transmission, transmission rate
selection, channel scan, and channel switch of each host in the communication group according to
the information gathered from the beacon frames. With the coordination of the leader, unnecessary
contentions and collisions can be avoided and thus enhances the throughput of the network. Fig. 5
is an example which shows that 4 devices want to join the communication group. In C-MAC, since
there are only two signaling slot at the beginning and the end of the beacon period, collisions occur
seriously. In the best case, if would take 2 superframes to let the 4 devices join the communication
group. While in the proposed EDA-MAC, since it can dynamically adjust the number of signaling
slots according to the number of estimated contenders [8] and thus it needs only one superframe to
let the 4 devices join the communication group.

dedicated beacon slot. As some unlicensed users has detected the rendezvous channel and intend to
join the communication group, the leader will count the number of successful joined hosts (denoted
as SUC) and the number of collisions (denoted as COL), and then it can estimated the number of
contenders (denoted as Ne) of current superframe according to the number of signaling slots (de-
noted as m), successful joined hosts, and collisions and calculates the number of possible contenders
of next superframe (denoted as Nc) as Nc = Ne−SUC+λ, where λ is the average arrival rate of the
join hosts of next superframe. The number of signaling slots of next superframe (denoted as Ns)
can then be set according to Nc. After the signaling phase, the leader will announce the dedicated
beacon slots of each newly joined hosts and Ns by its beacon frame so that each newly joined hosts
can start to use its dedicated beacon slots to start its communication and those who fails to join or
intends to join can randomly pick a signaling slot according to Ns during the signaling phase of next
superframe.
How to estimate the number of contenders according to the number of signaling slots, successful
joined hosts and collisions is shown as follows:
First, calculates the expected value of successful joined hosts and collisions with all the possible
numbers of contenders and signaling slots. The recursive functions to calculate the expected value of
successful joined hosts (denoted as ES(n,m)) and collisions (denoted as EC(n,m)) with n contenders
and m signaling slots are shown as follows that have been proposed in [8]:
ES(n,m)= pb(n,m,0)ES(n,m−1)+pb(n,m,1)(ES(n−1,m−1)+1)+∑nk=2 pb(n,m,k)ES(n−
k,m−1), where ES(0,0) = 0, ES(1,m) = 1, m > 0, and ES(n,1) = 0, n > 1.
EC(n,m) = pb(n,m,0)EC(n,m− 1) + pb(n,m,1)EC(n− 1,m− 1)+∑nk=2 pb(n,m,k)(EC(n−
k,m−1)+1), where EC(0,0) = 0, EC(1,m) = 0, m > 0, and EC(n,1) = 1, n > 1.
pb(n,m,k) =Cnk (
1
m
)k(m−1
m
)n−k is the probability that k hosts send their signals in the m-th time
slot and the other n− k hosts send their signals in the first (m− 1) time slots, where 0 ≤ k ≤ n,
Cnk =
n!
(n−k)!k! . Dynamic programming is used to solve ES(n,m) and EC(n,m).
Second, look up the tables generated by ES(n,m) and EC(n,m) to find the number of contenders
according to the number of signaling slots, successful joined hosts and collisions.
Third, estimate the number of contenders as Ne = max(Nsuc,Ncol,Nlow), where Nsuc and Ncol are
the numbers of contenders found according to the number of successful joined hosts and collisions,
respectively, and Nlow = SUC+COL×2 is the lower bound of the estimated number of contenders.
For example, if the number of signaling slots is 3 and there are 2 collisions and 1 successful
joined host. The lower bound of the estimated number of contenders is Nlow = SUC+COL× 2 =
2+ 2 = 4. By looking up Tables 2 and 3, we can find that Nsuc and Ncol are 5 and 6, respectively.
Therefore, the number of estimated contenders is Ne = max(Nsuc,Ncol,Nlow) = max(5,6,4) = 6. If
λ= 2, then the number of possible contenders of next superframe is Nc =Ne−SUC+λ= 6−1+2=
7. The number of signaling slots of next superframe Ns is set according to Ne and the expected
successful rate. If the expected successful rate is 60%, then there should be 7×60%= 4.2 successful
hosts. By checking Table 2, Ns should be set as 12.
When there are some collisions occurred in the signaling phase and there remains some available
time in the beacon period, we can add the second or even the third signaling phases at the end of the
beacon phase so as to further accelerate the join process as shown in Fig. 6.
Fig. 7 compares different approaches to divide the signaling slots when the number of signaling
slots is enough to achieve 60% successful rate. If we allocate 50% of signaling slots to the first
signaling phase, 30% of signaling slots to the second signaling phase, and 20% of signaling slots to
the third signaling phase (denoted as 50-30-20), the total number of successfully joined hosts is the

4.4 Recovery Mechanism
The goal of designing the recovery mechanism is to detect the interference from licensed user and
rescue the communication group of unlicensed users. There is a quite period (QP) during each data
transmission period for unlicensed users to detect the status of the licensed users as shown in Fig. 10.
The recovery mechanism uses backup channels to recover when the rendezvous channel interferes
with licensed users’ signals. The channel with better quality will be chosen as the backup channels.
If non-rendezvous channel interferes with licensed users, then the host return to rendezvous channel
to join the communication group again.
4.5 Maintenance mechanism
To balance the load and power consumption of each host in the same group, each host should play as
the leader in turn. Each host serves as the leader periodically in an order based on its join sequence
in the group. When the remaining power of a host is lower than a certain threshold, it will no longer
serve as the leader. When a host is going to leave the group, it will inform the leader in its dedicated
beacon slot. If the leader can no longer hear from its member, it should take back this member’s
dedicated beacon slot. On the other hand, if a host can no longer hear from its leader, it can join
other groups or form a new group.
5 Performance Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the proposed EDA-MAC, we compare its performance with that of
C-MAC. The simulation parameters is shown in Table 5. Why the expected success rate is set as
80% will be discussed later.
The performance metrics observed in our simulations are average join time and throughput.
5.1 Expected Successful Rate
Fig. 11 shows the impact of expected successful rate to average join time and throughput. As the
expected successful rate increases, the number of signaling slots also increases and the average join
time decreases. When the expected successful rate exceeds 80%, the beacon period will become too

on an cognitive wireless network without infrastructure which
is based on unlicensed ad hoc access. Before an unlicensed
user starts its communications, it should join a communication
group ﬁrst.
Several communication groups may coexist in the cognitive
wireless networks. A host and its neighbors can form a com-

Fig. 3. The structure of a Beacon Period
and recovery mechanisms. Finally, the maintenance mecha-
nism is presented.
A. Initialization mechanism
Initially, any unlicensed user, who wants to use the idle
spectrum (licensed or unlicensed), should scan the spectrum
ﬁrst. If it has detected an existing communication group,
it may follow the join process to join the communication
group or it may form a new communication group. The join
process would be described later. The ﬁrst host that scans the
spectrum and forms the communication group would become
the leader. The channel chosen to form the communication
group is named as the rendezvous channel. Any unlicensed
users intend to join the communication group should listen to
the rendezvous channel for a superframe to gather necessary
information announced by the leader.
Similar to C-MAC, the proposed EDA-MAC also divides
a channel into consecutive superframes. Each superframe
contains a beacon period (BP) and a data transmission period
(DTP). Each BP contains one to several signaling phases (SP),
a beacon phase, and a CTS phase as shown in Fig. 3. The
length of BP is variable but it cannot exceed the maximum
beacon period length. As the signaling phase becomes longer,
BP also becomes longer and DTP will become shorter be-
cause the length of superframe is ﬁxed. Each signaling phase
contains several signaling slots. During the signaling phase,
the host which intends to join the communication group will
contend to transmit a signal in one of the signaling slots.
The host which successfully transmit its signal without any
collision will be assigned with a dedicated beacon slot by the
leader and then it can communicate with other hosts in the
communication group.

C. Multi-channel Switching Mechanism
The goal of the multi-channel switching mechanism is to
achieve load balance in multi-channel structure. The leader
manages channel switching according the trafﬁc load of each
channel. The leader broadcast the channel switching message
at the end of the beacon period. The frame structure of other
channels is similar to the structure of RC. When a host needs to
switch to other channels, it follows the join process to join and
use the channel and follows the data transmission mechanism
to communicate with other hosts. The ﬁrst host that join and
use the channel will become the leader of the channel. To
maintain synchronization, the hosts, which has switched to
other channels, need to switch back to RC during the RC
leader’s dedicated beacon slot periodically.
D. Recovery Mechanism
The goal of designing the recovery mechanism is to detect
the interference from licensed user and rescue the communi-
cation group of unlicensed users. There is a quite period (QP)
during each data transmission period for unlicensed users to
detect the status of the licensed users as shown in Fig. 4. The
recovery mechanism uses backup channels to recover when
the rendezvous channel interferes with licensed users’ signals.
The channel with better quality will be chosen as the backup
channels. If non-rendezvous channel interferes with licensed
users, then the host return to rendezvous channel to join the
communication group again.
E. Maintenance mechanism
To balance the load and power consumption of each host in
the same group, each host should play as the leader in turn.
Each host serves as the leader periodically in an order based
on its join sequence in the group. When the remaining power
of a host is lower than a certain threshold, it will no longer
serve as the leader. When a host is going to leave the group, it
will inform the leader in its dedicated beacon slot. If the leader
can no longer hear from its member, it should take back this
member’s dedicated beacon slot. On the other hand, if a host
can no longer hear from its leader, it can join other groups or
form a new group.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
To evaluate the performance of the proposed EDA-MAC, we
compare its performance with that of C-MAC. The simulation
parameters is shown in Table III. Why the expected success
rate is set as 80% will be discussed later.

An Efﬁcient Dynamic Adjusting MAC Protocol for
Multichannel Cognitive Wireless Networks
Chih-Shun Hsu, Yuh-Shyan Chen, Chih-En He
Abstract—To enhance the usage of radio spectrum, a wireless
network, named as the cognitive wireless network, which allows the
unlicensed users to scan and use idle radio spectrum, has attracted
a lot of attention recently. Because the radio spectrum has to return
to the licensed user whenever the licensed user needs it, the radio
spectrum of cognitive wireless networks is a precious resource.
Hence, how to avoid collisions and enhance the throughput of
the network are important issues for designing MAC protocols of
cognitive wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient
dynamic adjusting MAC (EDA-MAC) protocol for cognitive wireless
networks. EDA-MAC is improved from C-MAC, which assigns each
joined host a dedicated beacon slot and thus it has a good potential
to avoid contentions and collisions and achieve high throughput. The
improvements we made are listed as follows: First, instead of a
ﬁxed number of signaling slots of C-MAC, EDA-MAC dynamically
adjusts the number of signaling slots according to the number of
estimated contenders and thus reduces the number of collisions and
shortens the join process. Second, each joined host can inform others
its transmission intention by its beacon frame. Since each joined
host has a dedicated beacon slot, almost all the beacon frames can
be sent without any collision. Third, each communication group
contains a leader. The leader is responsible for coordinating the join
process, data transmission, transmission rate selection, channel scan,
and channel switch of each host in the communication group. With
the coordination of the leader, unnecessary contentions and collisions
can be avoided and thus enhances the throughput of the network.
Simulation results justify the efﬁciency of the proposed EDA-MAC
protocol.

I. INTRODUCTION
The wireless communication spectrum is regulated by the
government agency. It permits licensed holders to use the
spectrum in particular geographical regions. Since most of the
licensed users do not use their allocated spectrum all the time,
how to make a good use the idle spectrum has become an
important issue.
The cognitive wireless network, which exploits opportunis-
tic spectrum access to employ the spare spectrum, has attracted
a lot of attention recently [1],[2]. In a cognitive wireless
network, unlicensed users employ the licensed spectrum when
licensed users are not using the spectrum and thus improves
the usage of the radio spectrum. The design of the medium
access control (MAC) protocol would greatly effect the ef-
ﬁciency of a network, especially for a cognitive wireless

network which does not have any guaranteed radio resource
and should prevent the unlicensed users from interfering
licensed users’ access to licensed spectrum. There are three
approaches to design the MAC protocol of cognitive wireless
networks: the random access approach [3],[4], time-slotted
approach [5], and the hybrid approach [6],[7]. The ﬁrst ap-
proach is chieﬂy based on the carrier sense multiple access
with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). The second approach
needs time synchronization, while time is divided into slots for
both common channel and data channel transmissions. The last
approach blends the characters of the other two approaches,
such that the control signal mainly occurs over synchronized
time slots and data is transmitted without time synchroniza-
tion. Random access protocols, which adopts CSMA/CA, will
cause a lot of contentions and collisions, and thus need to
spend more time in exchanging handshake signals and waste
radio spectrum of the cognitive wireless network. Therefore,
some researches try to make a better use of the spectrum.
C-MAC [7] is one of the latest MAC protocols designed for
multi-channel cognitive wireless networks. In C-MAC, each
channel is divided into several superframes as shown in Fig.1.
Only hosts using the same channel need to be synchronized;
hosts using different channels need not to be synchronized.
Therefore, it can avoid wasting the radio spectrum during
the Ad hoc Trafﬁc Indication Messages (ATIM) window and
thus improves the Multi-channel MAC (MMAC) protocol [4].
Besides, each joined host is assigned with a dedicated beacon
slot such that each joined host can use its dedicated beacon
slot to transmit beacon frames to its neighbors without any
contention and collision. The major drawbacks of C-MAC are
that it does not make a good use of the dedicated beacon
slot to avoid collisions of data transmissions and enhance the
throughput, and it has only a ﬁxed number of signaling slots
which may cause a long join process.
To improve C-MAC, we propose an efﬁcient dynamic
adjusting MAC (EDA-MAC) protocol for multi-channel cogni-
tive wireless networks. The improvements we made are listed
as follows: First, instead of a ﬁxed number of signaling slots of
C-MAC, EDA-MAC dynamically adjusts the number of sig-
naling slots according to the number of estimated contenders
and thus reduces the number of collisions and shortens the join
process. With a faster join process, the unlicensed user can join
a communication group efﬁciently and can start its transmis-
sion earlier and thus improves the throughput of the network.
Second, each joined host can inform others its transmission
intention by its beacon frame. Since each joined host has a
dedicated beacon slot, almost all the beacon frames can be
sent without any collision. By collecting all the information

To avoid collision and accelerate the join process, we
propose a dynamic adjusting join mechanism. When a new
communication group is formed, since there is only one host
in the communication group, the signaling phase is maximized
while the beacon phase contains only the leader’s dedicated
beacon slot. As some unlicensed users has detected the ren-
dezvous channel and intend to join the communication group,
the leader will count the number of successful joined hosts
(denoted as SUC) and the number of collisions (denoted as
COL), and then it can estimated the number of contenders
(denoted as Ne) of current superframe according to the number
of signaling slots (denoted as m), successful joined hosts, and
collisions and calculates the number of possible contenders
of next superframe (denoted as Nc) as Nc = Ne − SUC+ λ,
where λ is the average arrival rate of the join hosts of next
superframe. The number of signaling slots of next superframe
(denoted as Ns) can then be set according to Nc. After the
signaling phase, the leader will announce the dedicated beacon
slots of each newly joined hosts and Ns by its beacon frame
so that each newly joined hosts can start to use its dedicated
beacon slots to start its communication and those who fails
to join or intends to join can randomly pick a signaling slot
according to Ns during the signaling phase of next superframe.
How to estimate the number of contenders according to
the number of signaling slots, successful joined hosts and
collisions is shown as follows:
First, calculates the expected value of successful joined
hosts and collisions with all the possible numbers of con-
tenders and signaling slots. The recursive functions to calculate
the expected value of successful joined hosts (denoted as
ES(n,m)) and collisions (denoted as EC(n,m)) with n con-
tenders and m signaling slots are shown as follows that have
been proposed in [8]:
ES(n,m) = pb(n,m,0)ES(n,m − 1) + pb(n,m,1)(ES(n −
1,m − 1) + 1) + ∑nk=2 pb(n,m,k)ES(n − k,m − 1), where
ES(0,0) = 0, ES(1,m) = 1, m> 0, and ES(n,1) = 0, n> 1.
EC(n,m) = pb(n,m,0)EC(n,m − 1) + pb(n,m,1)EC(n −
1,m − 1) + ∑nk=2 pb(n,m,k)(EC(n − k,m − 1) + 1), where
EC(0,0) = 0, EC(1,m) = 0, m> 0, and EC(n,1) = 1, n> 1.
pb(n,m,k) =Cnk (
1
m)
k(m−1m )
n−k is the probability that k hosts
send their signals in the m-th time slot and the other n− k
hosts send their signals in the ﬁrst (m− 1) time slots, where
0 ≤ k ≤ n, Cnk =
n!
(n−k)!k! . Dynamic programming is used to
solve ES(n,m) and EC(n,m).
Second, look up the tables generated by ES(n,m) and
EC(n,m) to ﬁnd the number of contenders according to
the number of signaling slots, successful joined hosts and
collisions.
Third, estimate the number of contenders as Ne =
max(Nsuc,Ncol ,Nlow), where Nsuc and Ncol are the numbers of
contenders found according to the number of successful joined
hosts and collisions, respectively, and Nlow = SUC+COL×2
is the lower bound of the estimated number of contenders.
For example, if the number of signaling slots is 3 and
there are 2 collisions and 1 successful joined host. The lower
bound of the estimated number of contenders is Nlow =
SUC+COL× 2 = 2+ 2 = 4. By looking up Tables I and
II, we can ﬁnd that Nsuc and Ncol are 5 and 6, respec-

tively. Therefore, the number of estimated contenders is
Ne = max(Nsuc,Ncol ,Nlow) = max(5,6,4) = 6. If λ = 2, then
the number of possible contenders of next superframe is
Nc = Ne−SUC+λ= 6−1+2= 7. The number of signaling
slots of next superframe Ns is set according to Ne and the
expected successful rate. If the expected successful rate is
60%, then there should be 7× 60% = 4.2 successful hosts.
By checking Table I, Ns should be set as 12.
When there are some collisions occurred in the signaling
phase and there remains some available time in the beacon
period, we can add the second or even the third signaling
phases at the end of the beacon phase so as to further accelerate
the join process as shown in Fig. 3.
B. Data Transmission Mechanism
In this subsection, the rate selection protocol is described
ﬁrst, followed by the transmission scheduling protocol.
1) Rate Selection Protocol: The goal of rate selection is
to adopt the proper transmission rate so as to achieve higher
throughput. Our rate selection protocol is similar to the one
proposed in [9]. The RTS and CTS control frames have been
changed to encode a 4 bits rate subﬁeld and a 12 bits length
subﬁeld, to replace the 16 bits duration ﬁeld in the frames
However, to ﬁt the frame structure of our protocol and to avoid
contentions and collisions, we make some modiﬁcations as
follows: The leader is in a promiscuous mode. The RTS frame
is transmitted in the dedicated beacon slot of the sender. After
hearing the RTS sent by the sender, the leader will schedule
the reply sequence of the receiver. Each receiver reply a CTS
during the CTS phase according to the reply sequence and
thus it can complete the rate selection process without any
contention and collision as shown in Fig. 3.
2) Transmission Scheduling Protocol: The main goal of
data transmission scheduling is to avoid collisions and con-
tentions. After hearing the CTS send by the receiver, the leader
will assign each sender a transmission sequence according to
the requirement as shown in Fig. 4. For example, if fairness is
the major concern, the sender with least transmissions can
transmit ﬁrst. If the data transmission period is not long
enough to contain all the transmissions, the leader can ask
some senders and receivers to switch to other channels.
558
Fig. 6. Average join time vs. arrival rate of unlicensed users
proposed EDA-MAC is much shorter than that of C-MAC
especially when the arrival rate of unlicensed users increases.
Since the proposed EDA-MAC can dynamically adjust the
number of signaling slots according to the number of estimated
contenders, it is more scalable than C-MAC.
C. Throughput
Fig. 7 shows the impact of available channels, arrival rate of
unlicensed users, and trafﬁc load to throughput. As available
channels, arrival rate of unlicensed users, and trafﬁc load
increases, the throughput also increases. The proposed EDA-
MAC has higher throughput than C-MAC and declined slower
than C-MAC because our protocol can let unlicensed hosts
join fast and can avoid contentions and collisions and thus
can achieve higher throughput even when the trafﬁc load is
high.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed an efﬁcient dynamic adjust-
ing MAC (EDA-MAC) protocol for multi-channel cognitive
wireless networks. The proposed EDA-MAC can dynamically
adjust the number of signaling slots according to the number of
estimated contenders and thus reduces the number of collisions
and shortens the join process. Besides, our protocol make a
better use of the dedicated beacon slot and let the leader of
the communication group coordinate the join process, data
transmission, transmission rate selection, channel scan, and
channel switch of each host in the communication group. With
the coordination of the leader, unnecessary contentions and
collisions can be avoided and thus enhances the throughput of
the network. Simulation results have shown that the proposed
EDA-MAC protocol outperforms C-MAC in terms of average
join time and throughput.
