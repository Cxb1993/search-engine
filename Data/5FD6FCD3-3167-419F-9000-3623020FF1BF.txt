Simplified 6-DOF Simulation Models and Guidance Laws for 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 
Tain-Sou Tsay* 
Department of Aeronautical Engineering, National Formosa University, 
 Yun-Lin, Taiwan. 
 
ABSTRACT-In this appendix, simplified 6-DOF mathematical models are proposed for 
analyses and designs of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The derivations of those 
models can be based upon (1) design specifications of aerodynamics of a new UAV or (2) 
system identification datum of an existing UAV. Datum used are ratio of the lifting force to 
angle of attack, trim angle of fin and natural frequency for constant speed and altitude 
flight. Base on identification datum of aerodynamics, one can perform autopilot designs, 
and guidance laws developments before the aerodynamic model obtained from wind 
tunnel tests or the physical UAV can be applied. A Tomahawk-like cruise UAV example 
shows simplified 6-DOF models give good approximations to the real system for 
developing guidance and control laws. 
 
1. Introduction 
An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft without onboard pilot. The role of 
unmanned Aerial vehicles has been increasing significantly in both military and civilian 
operations. UAVs can be remote controlled or fly autonomously based on 
preprogrammed flight plans or more complex dynamic automation systems. Global 
position system(GPS) and image seeker can provide datum for mid-course and terminal 
guidance respectively. 
The simplified 6-DOF simulation model of unmanned aerial vehicle is usually used 
to evaluate the hardware specifications in System Requirement Review (SRR) phase. In 
this phase, there is no aerodynamic models get from expensive wind tunnel experiments. 
However, one may have design specifications of aerodynamics. They are derived from 
adjoin or Mote-Carlo simulations. They base on engaging requirement for moving or 
stationary target. The typical aerodynamic design specifications are (1)minimal maneuver 
capability, (2)turning rate constant, (3)bandwidth flight control system(FCS). (3) ratio of 
the lifting force to angle of attack/sideslip, (4) trim angle of fin with respect to angle of 
 3
In above equations, U, V, and W are velocity components measured on the missile body 
axes; P, Q, and R are the components of the body angular rate: zgygxg F,F,F  are the 
gravitational forces acting along the body axes and zyx I,I,I  are moments of inertia. 
The variable s  is the reference area, q  is the dynamic pressure:  
22 2222 /V/)WVU(q Mρρ ≡++=                           (7) 
l  is the reference length. The aerodynamic lifting forces ( zyx C,C,C ) and moments 
( nml C,C,C ) are function of Mach number, angle of attack (
*α ), angle of sideslip ( *β ); 
the angles of attack and sideslip are defined as

Small-signal perturbed models around a specified set of trim conditions *** R,Q,P( ,

where p, q, r are body angular rate deviations from trims )R,Q,P( *** ; zacca , yacca  
are body acceleration deviations from trims )A,A( YOZO ; and α and β are angles of 
attack and sideslip deviations from trims ),( ** βα , )()()( N,M,L ••• , )(Y •  and 
)(Z • are derivatives of moments ( nml C,C,C )/ forces ( zy C,C ) with respect to p, q, 
r, βα , , r,q,p δδδ . Equations (10) to (14) give the linearized flight system is a 5-th order 
system. The simplified 6-DOF system will be developed by using these linearized system 
with trim conditions.

3.2 Kinematics of UAV 
The kinematics of the UAV including transformations of body angular rates to 
attitude angle, forces to derivatives of velocities, and derivatives of velocities to 
derivatives of positions, They are given below:

The sequence of transformation is from yawing through pitching to rolling angles (i.e., 
φθψ ⇒⇒ ). The domain of yawing angle is °+<<°− 180180 ψ , pitching angle is 
°+<<°− 9090 θ , and rolling angle is °+<<°− 9090 φ . Therefore, there is a 
singularity at °= 90θ  of Eq.(17) and it needs quatered element method for vertical 
launch. In this work, vertical lauch is avoided by small perturbed from °= 90θ .

3.3 Autopilot design 
Autopilot design is based on the small-signal dynamic models described by 
Eqs.(10)-(16) with neglecting coupling terms( i.e., qL,L,L δβα , qrq N,L,M δδδ ). 
Neglecting aerodynamic couplings between each channel, transfer functions of q/q δ  
and q/azcg δ  can be found as in the form of

Eq.(25) is generally found by adjoin or Morte Calo simulation[  ]. Comparing coefficeints 
of Eqs.(24) and (25), values of gains iqiqoqsq K,W,K,K  can be found by following steps:

Let

Then, one can solve three simultaneous equations to find ( νμγ ,, ) and gains of the 
autopilot can be evaluated as

For example, giving a design specifications of the autopilot

The found values of gains iqiqoqsq K,W,K,K  are

3.4. Aerodynamics finding from transfer function 
Eqs.(22) and (23) respresent transfer functions of q/q δ  and q/azcg δ . Comparing 
Eqs.(20) and (21) to Eqs.(22) and (23) respectively, then aerodynamic coefficients given

Therefore, aerodynamic coefficients are can be found sequentially from Eq.(35) to 
Eq.(38). For example, qM  is found by Eq.(35) with αωζ Z,M,, Bnqnq . αM  is found by 
Eq.(36) with qM  found by Eq.(35). Now, considers a numerical example. one set of 
aerodynamic coefficients are evaluated and given below:

Similar to the pitching channel, equations for evaluation to find gains and 
aerodynamic coeficients of the yawing channel are evaluated. Fig.5 shows the autopilot

4. BTT guidance laws 
4.0 The Tomohawk cruise missile  
The concepts of the UAV’s guidance laws are based upon the Tomahawk cruise 
missile. The Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile has been used to attack a variety of fixed 
targets, including air defense and communications sites, often in high-threat environments. 
The land attack version of Tomahawk has inertial and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) 
radar guidance. The TERCOM radar uses a stored map reference to compare with the 
actual terrain to determine the missile's position. If necessary, a course correction is then 
made to place the missile on course to the target. Terminal guidance in the target area is 
provided by the optical Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system, which 
compares a stored image of target with the actual target image. The concepts of lateral and 
vertical guidance laws are shown in Fig.7 and Fig.8.

The problem of Eq.(50) is the UAV will busy to bank by introducing noise to guidance 
command AYI  or  AZI. Therefore, Eqs.(50) must be modified to reduce the unwanted bank 
due to nosie. In next paragraph, equations for tranfering the guidance commands on inertial 
axes to body axes are evaluated.

The guidance commands on inertial axes are first transferred to body axes for °= 0φ ,

7. Conclusions 
Simplified 6-DOF mathematical models have been proposed for analyses and 
designs of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The derivations of those models can be 
based upon (1) design specifications of aerodynamics of a new UAV or (2) system 
identification datum of an existing UAV. Datum used are ratio of the lifting force to angle of 
attack, trim angle of fin and natural frequency for constant speed and altitude flight. Base on 
identification datum of aerodynamics, one can perform autopilot designs, and guidance 
laws developments before the aerodynamic model obtained from wind tunnel tests or the 
physical UAV can be applied. A Tomahawk-like cruise UAV example shows simplified 
6-DOF models give good approximations to the real system for developing guidance and 
control laws.

Abstract 
In this paper, an automatic gain control scheme is proposed and used in the rolling channel for coping with 
aerodynamic coupling from pitching or yawing channel of a supersonic flight vehicle. The considered 
airframe is a rolling stabilized system with skid-to-turn maneuver. It always needs complicated gain logic for 
stable and unstable aerodynamic couplings. The effect of coupling is equivalent to the loop gain changing. 
Therefore, automatic gain control can be used to adjust the rolling loop gain automatically. It needs not 
conventional complicated gain scheduling technique.

I. Introductions 
It is well-known that aerodynamic couplings for 
large single-axis maneuver of cruciform missiles will 
destabilize or degrade the performance of the system 
[1, 2]. Higher gain crossover frequency ratios of the 
rolling channel to pitching and yawing channels are 
usually expected. They are usually used in 
conventional design techniques [3, 4]. They are 
diagonal dominant designs for multivariable 
feedback control systems. However, it is constrained 
by hardware dynamics. It will be seen that unstable 
aerodynamic couplings from pitching or yawing 
channel to the rolling channel appear in 
low-medium frequency band. They reduce the gain 
crossover frequency (WCR) and low frequency gain 
margin (LFGM) of the rolling channel. They also 
introduce phase lag. Therefore, high rolling loop 
gains are required to increase WCR and gain phase 
margin (PM) while leaving difference between 
high frequency gain margin (HFGM) and LFGM 
be unchanged. But for stable aerodynamic 
coupling situations, they increase WCR; i.e., reduce 
HFGM, Therefore, low rolling loop gains are 
required to decrease WCR and gain PM. Rolling 
loop gain adaptive logic is usually used in 
conventional design techniques [3,4] for 
recovering the WCR to the desired value and find 
suitable LFGM, PM, and HFGM. The gain 
adaptation is effective while it needs information 
to identify the flight situation which is in stable or 
unstable coupling. The gain scheduling technique 
is used in TK-1, TK-2, TJ-2 supersonic missiles of 
Taiwan. It usually needs complicated two or 
three-dimensional interpolation for finding suitable 
gains. Furthermore, it is complicated and time 
consumptive in the design phase to find gain tables. 
Simple and effective way for automatic gain adaptation 
is generally expected. This is the motivation of this 
paper. 
In following sections, operating theorem of the 
proposed automatic gain control scheme[5-8] is 
discussed with a simple numerical first, and then 
applied to a rolling flight control system [9, 10] for 
coping with aerodynamic coupling. The considered 
system is a supersonic air-to-air missile. Simu- 
lations with large aerodynamic couplings and 
system parameter variations testing are made to

alternately. Since there are eight possible 
combinations of se , isV , and csV  may exist for 
solving Eqs. (14) to (16), another constrain Eqs. are 
required. They are above three equations. Three 
relationship ( se , csV ), ( se , isV ), and ( isV , csV ) 
are derived by equaling Eqs. (17) and (19), Eqs. (17) 
and (18), Eqs. (18) and (19), respectively. 
Now, consider the existence of the steady-state 
solutions ( se , isV , csV ). From Eq. (15), one can see 
that it becomes iV  independent for )0(KD  
equals to zero. From Eq. (16), one can see that it 
becomes cV  independent for )0(HD equals to 
zero. These properties imply that only type-0 
controllers K(s) and H(s) are suitable. Assume the 
plant P(s) is a type-0 system also, then the transfer 
function of K(s), H(s) and P(s) can be described by 
following rational polynomials. They are

A sufficient condition for deriving real solutions of 
Eqs. (23) to (25) are values of phk kandkk    ,  given 
in Eqs. (23) to (25) greater than zeros. 
Using the found csV  to replace the multiplier 
shown in Fig.1a, then the overall nonlinear control 
system can be linearized with respect to steady-state 
conditions csV  and isV  for a specified valued of

Since the considered system is a skid-to-turn 
airframe, therefore only couplings from pitching or 
yawing channels to the rolling channel are 
considered.

Eq.(55) can be used as a coupling measure for 
adjusting the rolling loop gains.

3.2. The Conventional Designs 
Fig.8 is the conventional well-proven control 
configuration of missile autopilots [3,4]; in 
which ( opoK , ipoK ), ( sqK , oqK , iqW , iqK ) and 
( srK , orK , irW , irK ) are gains of rolling pitching, 
and yawing channels to be adapted. In general, they 
are first gain scheduled with missile velocity and 
altitude. opoK  and ipoK  are further adapted by 
values of angles of attack/sideslip; i.e., 
ipoip KSckipK ×=  and opoop KSckopK ×= . opoK  and 
ipoK  are gains of zero aerodynamic coupling 
situations. Angles of attack/sideslip are usually 
replaced by measurable accelerations ZfA  and YfA . 
In this work, more attentions are paid for large angles 
of attack or sideslip; i.e., large maneuvers of yawing 
or pitching channels. For skid-to-turn missile, the 
performance of the rolling channel pays a central role 
for coping with aerodynamic dynamic coupling from 
yawing or pitching channels. It needs not other 
gain adjusting logic for pitching/ yawing 
channels.

which  βα βα LL +  can viewed as the disturbance 
of the rolling inner loop. Another coupling is the 
kinematical coupling. It is the disturbance of the 
rolling outer loop. The value of the aerodynamic 
coupling is much greater than that of kinematical 
coupling for skid-to-turn missile. Therefore, the 
proposed control scheme is applied in the inner loop 
only.  
Fig.11b shows the control configuration with the 
propose control scheme. Certainly, the proposed 
control scheme can be applied in the outer loop also. 
The purpose of the AGC loop is to make rolling 
angular rate P track the command Pc. The rolling 
angle command cφ  is always set to be zero for 
skid-to-turn flight vehicle. Therefore, the maximal 
value of the rolling angular rate can be used as a 
robust check for coping with aerodynamic coupling. 
Consider coefficients of the flight condition A1 
given in Appendix A. Values of coefficients are 
pLδ = 14363, pL =-3.497, αL =-629.9, 8238=βL  
are found. Assume that the desired tracking error 
se = 2101 −× radium for the command Pc=1 radium, 
then Eq.(23) gives hkkk =2.4102 for Pk = 4107.6. 
Selecting kk ≡10, then one has hk = 0.241. 
Substituting found value of ( hk kk , ) into Eqs (24) 
and (25) with constrains described by Eqs.(17) to 
(19), one has solutions isV =0.10 and csV =0.00241. 
Table 2 gives steady-state values ( se , isV , csV ) of 
another values of Pc. Using found values of ( hk kk , ), 
controllers can be defined as )s/(.)s(H γ+≡ 124010  
and  010.)s(K ≡ .  
Using steady-state values given in Table 2, pole 
locations of linearized systems are found for 
10=γ . From Table 2, one can see the large value 
of Pc, the less value of one pole of the linearized 
system. This implies that the large value of Pc, the 
large bandwidth will be. After the outer loop closed 
with opK , then comparisons between the conven- 
tional method and the proposed method can be 
made to show merits of the proposed method. Note 
that opK  is found by Eq. (63).

3.4. 5-DOF Simulation Verifications 
In this subsection, comparison between the 
conventional and the proposed AGC control 
scheme are made. Figs.12(a) to (d) show 
simulation results with the conventional method; 
i.e., gain logic ( Sckip , Sckop ) given in Table 1 is 
applied. The conditions for large unstable and 
stable couplings are made; i.e., (AZC,AYC)= 
(-23G,-1.47G) and (AZC,AYC)= (-13.5G,-13.5G). 
The corresponding flight conditions are A1 and 
A4. Fig.12(a) shows time responses of accele- 
ration command and feedback(Azc, Azf) of 
pitching channel, Fig.12(b) shows acceleration 
command and feedback( Ayc, Ayf) of yawing 
channel, Fig.12(c) shows three body angular 
rates(P,Q,R), Fig.12(d) shows angle of attack 
and sideslip( α , β ). Fig.13 shows simulation 
results with the proposed control scheme in inner 
loop. From Figs. 12 and 13, one can see that the 
proposed method provides compatible results with 
the conventional method. But only single design is 
needed. 
4.Conclusions 
In this paper, an automatic gain control scheme was 
proposed and used in the rolling channel for coping 
with aerodynamic coupling from pitching or yawing 
channel of a supersonic flight vehicle. Only single 
design is needed. It needs not conventional 
complicated gain scheduling technique.

Ⅰ. Introduction 
It is well known that aerodynamic couplings from 
pitching/yawing channels to rolling channels of 
cruciform skid-to-turn missiles will destabilize or 
degrade the performance of the system[1,2]. Higher gain 
crossover frequency ratios of the rolling channel to 
pitching/ yawing channels for decoupling are usually 
expected. They are usually used in conventional design 
techniques [3, 4], and are diagonal dominant designs 
for multivariable feedback systems[5,6]. They are 
disturbance rejection designing techniques. However, it 
is constrained by hardware dynamics, especially for 
bandwidth-limited fin actuators.  
Furthermore, aerodynamic couplings from 
pitching / yawing channels to rolling channels are 
classified into unstable and stable aerodynamic 
couplings. The unstable- coupling decreases the gain 
crossover frequency of the rolling channel, while the 
stable coupling increases the gain crossover 
frequencies. They are corresponding to large 
single-axis and large double-axis maneuvers, 
respectively for cruciform missile. However, small 
maneuvers are almost not disturbing the gain 
crossover frequencies. Therefore, complicated gain 
adaptations according to magnitudes of maneuvers to 
keep almost constant gain crossover frequency are 
usually required.  
They are call gain logic and usually need vast 
mathematic evaluations. In this work, fuzzy gain 
logic is used on-line or off-line and gives simple 
manner to describe small / large unstable / stable 
couplings and large/small gain adaptations for the 
rolling loop automatically. 
Other possible methods are to use cross- 
decoupling controllers[7-9], output feedback- 
decoupling controllers[10,11] and Dynamic Inversion 
(DI) methods[12-18]. In general, inverting the transfer 
function matrix of plant for missile flight control 
system suffers from it has large modeled, un- 
modeled uncertainties, non- minimum-phase zeros 
and large faster variations of cross-coupling dynamics. 
This literature is organized as follows: effects of 
aerodynamic couplings are discussed and classified in 
Section II; conventional designs are discussed and 
applied in Section III; the proposed fuzzy logic is 
applied to the considered system in Section IV; and 
5DOF simulations verification are performed. It will be 
seen that the fuzzy flight control system provides simple 
manner to get same robustness comparing to those of 
conventional designs technique. All analyzed results 
will be verified by 5-DOF simulations under system

Fig.5 shows the constant- CT  loci with respect to 
|| ZOA  and .|A| YO  It is redrawn from Fig.3. The 
shaded-area is the stable aerodynamic coupling region 
and can be further partitioned into “ZC”, “ZCÆSSC”, 
SSC”, “SSCÆLSC”, “LSC” areas roughly; i.e., from 
zero-coupling(ZC) through small-stable 
coupling(SSC) to large- stable coupling (LSC). The 
other region is the unstable aerodynamic coupling 
region and can be further partitioned into “ZCÆSUC”, 
“SUCÆLUC” and “LUC” areas roughly also; i.e., 
from zero-coupling(ZC) through small-unstable 
coupling (SUC) to large-unstable coupling(LUC). The 
boundaries between areas are ambiguous. It will be 
seen proper gains of the autopilot are dependent on 
zero-small-large values of aerodynamic couplings. 
The gain logic in conventional autopilot according to 
|A| ZO  and |A| YO  is very complicated. 
 
 
Ⅲ. Conventional Design 
Techniques 
Fig.6 excluding the fuzzy logic block is the 
conventional well-proven control configuration of 
missile autopilots[3,4]; in which ( opoK , ipoK ), 
( oqK , iqW , iqK ) and ( orK , irW , irK ) are gains of 
rolling/pitching/yawing channels to be adapted. In 
general, they are first gain scheduled with missile 
velocity and altitude. opoK  and ipoK  are further adapted 
by values of angles of attack/sideslip; 
i.e., ipoip KSckipK ×=  and .KSckopK opoop ×=  opoK  
and ipoK  are gains of zero aerodynamic coupling 
situations. Angles of attack/sideslip are usually replaced 
by measurable accelerations ZfA  and .AYf  In this work, 
more attentions are paid for large angles of 
attack/sideslip; i. e., large maneuvers of yawing / 
pitching channels. For skid-to-turn missile, the 
performance of the rolling channel pays a central role for 
coping with aerodynamic dynamic coupling from 
yawing / pitching channels. It needs not other gain 
adjusting logic for pitching / yawing channels. 
In general, three single-input single-output 
(SISO) systems are designed first individually for 
conventional autopilot designs to get nominal 
gains( opoK , ipoK ), ( oqK , iqW , iqK ), ( orK , irW , irK ). 
And then connect them with aero-dynamic / 
kinematical coupling terms (see Fig.2); i.e., 
MIMO system, for verification the suitability of 
SISO designs. Several iterations are usually 
needed to get gain adaptive factor Sckip  and Sckop  
for different values of angles of attack/sideslip.

for yawing channel. The robustness specifications 
of the rolling channel with aerodynamic couplings 
from pitching/yawing channels are defined as: 
 
1. Low frequency gain margin (LFGM) ≦ 0.707; 
2. High frequency gain margin (HFGM)≧ 1.707; 
3. Phase margin( PM )              ≧ 55deg 
4. Gain crossover frequency   9Hz≦ CRω ≦12Hz 
 
The break point for specification checking is 
at rolling inner loop. Table 1 gives final results 
with aerodynamic coefficient given in Appendix 
A, and hardware and compensators dynamics on 
S-domain given in Appendix B. Digital 
compensators are derived from bilinear 
transformation: )1(/)1(2 +−= zTzs s  in 5-DOF 
simulations given in Section V. The gains 
( opoK , ipoK , oqK , iqW , iqK , orK , irW , irK  ) give in 
Appendix A. The bandwidths of rolling/pitching/ 
yawing channels are 6Hz/≧1.1Hz/ ≧1.1Hz; 
respectively. Fig.4 is frequency responses of 
flight conditions (A1, A4, A10) with all 
( Sckip , Sckop )=(1, 1). A10 is the zero- coupling 
case, A1 is a large unstable-coupling case(LUC), 
and A4 is a large stable-coupling case(LSC). Fig.6 
is frequency responses of flight condition (A1, A4, 
A10) with ( Sckip , Sckop ) given in Table 1. From 
Figs.4 and 6, one can see the un-stable system 
becomes stable, and large gain crossover 
frequency is reduced after ( Sckip , Sckop ) are 
introduced. 
From Table 1 and Fig.5, one can see that 
Sckip  and Sckop  are nonlinear functions of || ZOA  
and || YOA . Roughly speaking, the value of Sckop  
is increasing for max( || ZOA , || YOA ) is increasing. 
Sckip  is increasing for | CT | is increasing in unstable 
aerodynamic coupling while decreasing for | CT | is 
increasing in stable aerodynamic coupling. Note that 
the single-axis maneuver gives unstable aerodynamic 
coupling while double-axis maneuver gives stable 
aerodynamic coupling. Explicit formulation for Sckip

Abstract
In this paper, a nonlinear decoupling technique is proposed for analyzes and designs of a serious aerodynamic coupled missile ﬂight control
system. Decoupling is obtained from multiplications of two measurable accelerations with three controllable output commands of the autopilot.
They give exact signs and magnitudes proportional to aerodynamic decoupling. No matrix inversion of the system dynamic for decoupling is
needed. From frequency responses of the rolling channel, it will be seen that the decoupling and robustness for copping with aerodynamic
couplings can be obtained simultaneously. Furthermore, the decoupling characteristics are kept almost unchanged for large system parameter
variations and uncertainties. The 5-DOF simulations give same conclusions.

1. Introduction
Missile ﬂight control systems are generally 3 × 3 multivari-
able feedback control systems. It is well-known that aerody-
namic couplings for large single-axis manoeuver of cruciform
missiles will destabilize or degrade the performance of the sys-
tem [1,2]. Higher gain crossover frequency ratios of the rolling
channel to pitching and yawing channels are usually expected.
They are usually used in conventional design techniques [3,4].
They are diagonal dominant designs for multivariable feedback
systems [5,6]. However, it is constrained by hardware dynam-
ics. It will be seen that unstable aerodynamic couplings from
pitching or yawing channel to the rolling channel appear in
low-medium frequency band. They reduce the gain crossover
frequency (WCR) and low frequency gain margin (LFGM) of
the rolling channel. They also introduce phase lag. Therefore,
higher rolling loop gains are required to increase WCR and gain
phase margin (PM) while leaving difference between high fre-
quency gain margin (HFGM) and LFGM be unchanged. LFGM
and PM often become unacceptable for large aerodynamic cou-

plings with gain adaptation only. But for stable aerodynamic
coupling situations, they increase WCR; i.e., reduce HFGM,
Therefore, low rolling loop gains are required to decrease WCR
and gain PM. Rolling loop gain adaptive logic is usually used
in conventional design techniques [3,4] for recovering the WCR
to the desired value and ﬁnd suitable LFGM, PM, and HFGM.
However, for large aerodynamic couplings, LFGM, PM, and
HFGM cannot all satisfy suitable values. Therefore, another
design technique to obtain suitable LFGM, PM, and HFGM
is expected. This is the motivation of this research. Technique
for reducing coupling effects will be proposed. It is rather than
using large rolling loop gain to cope with disturbance from yaw-
ing or pitching channel.
Other possible methods are to use feed forward cross-
decoupling controllers [7–9] and output feedback-decoupling
controllers [10,11]. In general, missile ﬂight control system de-
signed by inverting the transfer function matrix of plant is not
robust for coping with large modeled, unmodeled uncertainties,
non-minimum-phase zeros. The internal stability must be guar-
anteed. Large number of cross coupling designs may be needed
and scheduled for different ﬂight conditions (FCs) in whole
ﬂight envelope.
Dynamic Inversion (DI) is another possible method for de-
signing multivariable control laws for ﬂight control systems
[12–18]. A DI controller consists of two parts. In inner loop,

Eqs. (10)–(16), in which grey blocks show coupling terms be-
tween rolling, yawing, and pitching channels. The object of this
paper is to reduce effects of coupling terms.
For large angle of attack (α∗) and small angle of sideslip
(β∗), the magnitude of terms tanβ∗ and Lα will much less than
those of tanα∗ and Lβ , thus the original 3 × 3 system can be
decomposed into a 2 × 2 roll-yaw coupled system and a pitch-
ing system. For the case of large value of β∗ and small value
of α∗, the original 3 × 3 system can be decomposed into a
2 × 2 roll-pitch coupled system and a yawing system. In the
following paragraph, the 2×2 roll-yaw coupled system and the
2 × 2 roll-pitch coupled system are used to illustrate and ana-
lyze aerodynamic coupling effects. The major coupling effects
to be decoupled will be derived.
Now, consider the coupling effect from yawing channel to
rolling channel of the 2×2 roll-yaw coupled system. The trans-
fer function of p/δr can be used to illustrate the coupling from
yawing channel to rolling channel. The transfer function of

Since Nr is negative for the considered missile is a stable air-
frame (i.e., positive static margin), the situation with positive
value of α∗Lβ is called the unstable aerodynamic coupling for
it will destabilize or degrade performance of the system; while
negative value of α∗Lβ is called the stable aerodynamic cou-
pling. Note that the magnitude of Lβ given in the numerator
of Eq. (17) is much greater than that of Lδr . Such that Lβ and
α∗Lβ are two major coupling terms. They affect not only the
magnitude of responses but also the stability of the system.
Eq. (17) gives also that the coupling behavior due to Lβ and
α∗Lβ will occur in the low-medium frequency band.
Considering another simpliﬁed 2× 2 roll-pitch coupled sys-
tem, the transfer function of p/δq is in the form of

p/δq represents the coupling effect from pitching channel
to rolling channel. Similar to the simpliﬁcation of Eq. (17),

next section to show the signiﬁcant improvement by proposed
decoupling method. The considered system is a sea sparrow-
like missile [20,21]. Small perturbed aerodynamic coefﬁcients
of the considered system are given in Appendix A for variable
combinations of angle of attacks (α∗) and sideslip (β∗). It gives
that performance and robustness of the considered system will
be largely affected by Lβ for maximal value of coupling coef-
ﬁcient Lβ is about two third of Lδp .
Neglecting coupling terms (gray blocks) shown in Fig. 2, the
overall system becomes to three SISO systems. In general, three
SISO systems are designed ﬁrst individually for conventional
design methods. Then connecting them with aerodynamic and
kinematical coupling terms for verifying the suitability of SISO
designs. Several iterations are usually needed for the rolling
channel. Transfer functions of three SISO systems are

gain adjusting logics for the rolling channel gains Kip and Kop .

The uses of Skip and Skop are to increase low frequency gain for
coping with unstable aerodynamic couplings; i.e., large angle
of attack. They are functions of A∗Z and found by curve ﬁtting
from designs of different trim conditions. The use of Skip will
increase the gain crossover frequency for large value of A∗Z .
The use of Skop will increase Low Frequency Gain Margins
(LFGMS) while losing Phase Margin (PM) and keeping gain
crossover frequency (WCR) almost be unchanged. Ksq and Ksr
shown in Figs. 3 and 4 are used to get exact command tracking.
They are in the form of
Ksq = 1+ 9.8/VM/Koq (54)
and
Ksr = 1+ 9.8/VM/Kor (55)
where VM is air speed in m/s. Compensators and hardware
dynamics are given in Appendix B in S-domain. Digital com-
pensators are derived from bilinear transformation: s = 2(z −
1)/Ts(z + 1). Ts = 10 m s is the sampling interval. From Ta-
ble 1, one can see that it is a good design for SISO systems;
but LFGMS are reduced incrementally for larger coupling term
added; i.e., MIMO system. Table 1 gives that LFGMs are un-
acceptable for α∗ > 6◦. Note that the large value of α∗, the
large coupling to rolling channel will be. Note also that dif-
ferences between HFGM and LFGM are too small for large
angle of attacks. For example, it is 5.62 dBs for (α∗, β∗) =
(12◦,1◦). One can adjust the loop gain to obtain LFGM =
0.7165 (−2.808 dBs) and HFGM = 1.3679 (+2.808 dBs).
However, they are not good enough for coping with plant un-
certainties in gain variation.
The effect of coupling for (α∗, β∗) = (12◦,1◦) are shown in
Fig. 5. It is open-loop frequency responses of the rolling chan-
nel. The broken point is at the position between δpc and actua-
tor. The solid-lines are frequency responses of the rolling SISO
system, and the doted-lines are those of 3 × 3 MIMO system
while the rolling inner loop being broken only. Fig. 5 shows that
loop gain in low-medium frequency band is reduced largely by
introducing coupling. Eq. (18) gives same conclusion. The cor-

and β˜ . The oscillating frequency is 2.75 Hz. Fig. 6 gives same
conclusion in frequency domain. Table 1 gives same conclusion
also.
Fig. 8 shows simulating results with decoupling described by
Eqs. (21)–(23). It can be seen that the performance and stabil-
ity of the system are improved signiﬁcantly. The maximal value
of rolling angular rate is equal to −15.6 deg/s. Note that con-
stant decoupling gains given in Table 2 for (α∗, β∗) = (12◦,1◦)
are used in whole simulating process. ±5 G varying testing for
AZC are applied after 2 seconds. It is corresponding to angle
of attack (α∗) varying from 10◦ to 14◦. These testing give de-
coupled behavior keeps almost unchanged for plant variations.
It can emulate system uncertainties. Fig. 9 shows simulation re-
sults for (α∗, β∗) = (1◦,1◦) with decoupling gains found for
(α∗, β∗) = (12◦,1◦). ±1 G varying testing for AZC are ap-
plied after 2 seconds. This is a small aerodynamic coupling
condition. It can be seen that over decoupling is avoided. This
gives same conclusion stated in above section for values of
(AZf ,AYf ) can adjust decoupling terms automatically.

7. Conclusions
In this paper, decoupling loops with gains found by eliminat-
ing off-diagonal terms of the state transition matrix have been
discussed and applied to a supersonic missile. Closed-form so-
lutions of decoupling gains were found easily by a simpliﬁed
system and veriﬁed by the complete system including hard-
ware dynamics and compensations. Decoupling effects were
kept almost unchanged for large system parameter variations
and uncertainties. One set of decoupling gains found for large
aerodynamic coupling condition can be widely used for small
aerodynamic coupling condition. This is due to the amount of
decoupling was adjusted automatically by (AZf ,AYf ). There-
fore, it is need not adaptive or scheduled decoupling gains.
From 5-DOF simulation results, one can see that the proposed
method gave a possible way to cope with aerodynamic coupling
for high angle of attacks.
