Abstract 
Most of the research on the concept of ‘ageing-in-place’ has focused on surveys of the 
needs of senior citizens and/or the quality of the services delivered to them; however, 
service-system innovation for ageing-in-place has received very little research attention. 
The present study addresses this issue by proposing a TRIZ-based service-system 
innovation model for ageing-in-place. In this model, a TRIZ parameter correspondence 
table, which integrates TRIZ contradiction parameters and home-care service-quality 
determinants, is developed to deal with service contradiction systematically. A TRIZ 
contradiction matrix is then applied to generate inventive solutions for the innovation of the 
home-care service system. A case study is then conducted to demonstrate the applicability 
of the proposed model. 
Keywords: TRIZ-based service system innovation model, contradiction matrix, innovation, 
home care, ageing-in-place. 
1. Introduction 
Advances in medical care and public health have meant that people are living longer, which has 
resulted in every developed country in the world facing significant difficulties in coping with the 
accommodation and social needs of an increasingly older population. In response to these 
demographic problems, various strategies have been suggested to facilitate independent living by 
senior citizens, preferably in their own homes (Fashimpar, 1983; Birnbaum, et al., 1984). One 
such strategy is the concept of ‘ageing-in-place’, which is a diversified care model first proposed 
in the 1960s to deal with the issues of an ageing population. The aim of ageing-in-place is to 
provide appropriate care for senior citizens in their local area by integrating the services of 
nursing homes, community-care agencies, and home-care agencies (Birnbaum, et al., 1984; Kane, 
1995; Wu & Chuang, 2001). In doing so, the strategy takes into account the preference of many 
senior citizens to maintain their independence, dignity, and quality of life by having appropriate 
care services delivered to their own homes, or to nearby community centres and nursing homes 
(Cutchin, 2003; Palley, 2003; Francis & Netten, 2004; Gilleard, et al., 2007). 
A review of the relevant literature reveals that the ageing-in-place strategy has been 
implemented through three main service-delivery models: (i) institution-care services; (ii) 
community-care services; and (iii) home-care services (Marek & Rantz, 2000; Chapin & Dobbs-
Kepper, 2001; Wu & Chuang, 2001; Cutchin, 2003; Hawes, et al., 2003; Stone & Reinhard,

2.1 Ageing-in-place service quality 
Senior citizens are increasingly expressing a preference for remaining in their own homes 
because so-called ‘ageing-in-place’ offers a continuation of the privacy and flexibility to which 
they have become accustomed in their lives (Marek & Rantz, 2000; Chapin & Dobbs-Kepper, 
2001; Wu & Chuang, 2001). Furthermore, the provision of assistance in the form of services to 
support daily living decreases the dependence of senior citizens on the services of institutional 
nursing homes and hospitals (Marek & Rantz, 2000; Chapin & Dobbs-Kepper, 2001). A well-
developed service system for ageing-in-place can thus support the desire of many senior citizens 
to maintain independent living in their own homes.  
The issue of service quality in the context of ageing-in-place programs has become a 
popular research topic in the past two decades (American Association of Retired Persons, 1990; 
Francis & Netten, 2004; Cohen-Mansfield & Frank, 2008; Yang & Hsiao, 2009). In particular, 
the determinants of service quality to improve the quality of life of senior citizens have been 
examined in the research undertaken by several authors (Francis & Netten, (2004); Salomon et 
al., (1999); Raynes et al., (2001); Rubin et al., (2001). Drawing on reviews of the literature and 
interviews with senior citizens, these researchers have established that the issues of greatest 
concern to senior citizens are service reliability, service flexibility, service continuity, and the 
communication skills, attitude, and knowledge of service providers. In a similar vein, Salomon et 
al. (1999) found that senior citizens were concerned about transparency of medical information, a 
wide selection of available services, continuity of service, psychological and social support, and 
the numbers and attributes of staff members (care-giving skills, communication skills, attitude, 
trustworthiness, etc.). 
Francis & Netten (2004) found six determinants of service quality in ageing-in-place: (i) 
continuity of care staff and the development of trusting relationships between staff and clients; 
(ii) communication skills of care staff and clear comprehensible service schedules; (iii) flexibility 
of services to meet senior citizens’ fluctuating needs; (iv) reliability of care staff members; (v) 
staff attitudes; and (vi) competence of care workers.  
In addition to studying the determinants of service quality in ageing-in-place, researchers 
have also examined the question of the availability of resources for adequate service quality. 
Several authors have indicated that demand is growing for both ageing-in-place and assisted 
living facilities (Birnbaum, et al., 1984; Hooyman & Kiyak, 1996; Lander, et al., 1997; Haight, et 
al., 1998; Citro & Hermanson, 1999; Leon & Moyer, 1999; Mitchell & Kemp, 2000; Chapin & 
Dobbs-Kepper, 2001; Stone & Reinhard, 2007). These researchers all agree that the provision of 
high-quality service is an essential aspect of meeting the demand for home care for senior 
citizens with supportive services in a homelike environment. Indeed, several researchers have 
suggested that ageing-in-place should provide a home-care service on a 24-hour basis with a high 
degree of customer choice and control (Zimmerman & Sloane, 1999; Chapin & Dobbs-Kepper, 
2001). This will require the provision of further supportive resources if ageing-in-place is to 
provide an appropriate level of service quality for senior citizens. 
2.2 TRIZ methodology 
The ‘Theory of Inventive Problem Solving’ (Russian acronym: ‘TRIZ’) was proposed by the 
Russian inventor Genrikh Altshuller in 1946 when he categorised more than 200,000 worldwide 
engineering patents in a novel way. The aim was to define generalisable patterns in inventive 
solutions and to identify the distinguishing characteristics of the problems that these inventions 
had overcome. Altshuller claimed that the same problems were often solved repeatedly using 40 
fundamental principles, which he subsequently proposed as the ‘40　TRIZ inventive principles’. 
He also categorised the 200,000 patents in accordance with ‘39 engineering parameters’, some of 
which were noted to be mutually contradictory. These engineering parameters and the inventive 
principles were subsequently combined to produce the so-called ‘TRIZ contradiction matrix’. In 
this matrix, the 39 parameters are arranged on each side of a two-dimensional matrix according to 
their contradictions. At each intersection, some inventive principles are nominated as a reference 
to resolve the contradiction between these corresponding parameters. 
The 40 inventive principles of TRIZ, which are claimed to provide a complete description 
of innovative solution thinking, are applied to solve a given situation involving a contradiction. 
 Stage 1: TRIZ model preparation 
 Identify users. 
 Extract service quality determinants. 
 Map determinants into TRIZ parameters. 
 Develop a TRIZ parameter corresponding table. 
Stage 4: Generation of inventive solutions  
 Propose inventive solutions. 
 Evaluate inventive solutions. 
 Decide optimal solutions. 
Stage 2: Service quality survey 
 Design questionnaire of service quality. 
 Survey the service quality determinants. 
 Extract the worst service quality determinants. 
Stage 3: Conduct of the TRIZ process 
 Formulate function attribute analysis diagram. 
 Detect need-to-be improved TRIZ parameters 
 Analyze contradiction matrix. 
 
Figure 1. A systematic TRIZ-based service-innovation model for ageing-in-place 
The purpose of the first stage is to prepare the essential information that the TRIZ 
methodology requires. First, clients of ageing-in-place programs are identified and their service-
quality needs are delineated by a combination of: (i) a review of the relevant literature; and (ii) 
surveys of users’ needs through observation and interview. The determinants of ageing-in-place 
service quality are then mapped with the corresponding 39 TRIZ engineering parameters, thus 
establishing the TRIZ parameter correspondence table, which is an essential tool for establishing 
the applicability and reliability of the parameter mapping results. 
In the second stage, the service quality of ageing-in-place is assessed by questionnaire 
survey of senior citizens who receive the services and staff members who provide the services. 
This requires the development of an ageing-in-place service-quality questionnaire based on the 
service-quality determinants identified in the first stage. As a result of the survey, the worst 
service-quality determinants are identified. 
In the third stage, the TRIZ process is conducted to analyse the problems of the service 
systems used in ageing-in-place. First, a function-attribute analysis diagram is constructed to 
detect relationships between negative (‘harmful’) and positive (‘useful’) parameters in the service 
system. The TRIZ contradiction matrix is then utilised to generate inventive principles for 
improving ageing-in-place service systems. The ‘harmful’ and ‘useful’ parameters, as previously 
detected, are mapped individually onto the TRIZ contradiction matrix, following which the 
inventive principles that exist within the contradiction matrix are generated. A systematic TRIZ 
process is thus used to illustrate that the service system functions as a network of cause-and-
effect relationships between ‘harmful’ and ‘useful’ functions. Meanwhile, the TRIZ contradiction 
matrix also provides a systematic approach to generate inventive principles. 
In the fourth stage, the inventive solutions are generated and evaluated by managers of 
ageing-in-place programs, which can stimulate the managers to propose further inventive

A reliability analysis was then conducted to examine the correspondence of service-quality 
determinants and TRIZ parameters. An expert checklist based on the correspondence table was 
also developed to examine the reliability of the table. Six experts (academics and practitioners of 
either ageing-in-place or TRIZ) were invited to provide the checklist. Each expert indicated 
‘agreement’ (with an asterisk * in each cell in Table 3), or ‘disagreement’ (with a blank space in 
each cell). The degree of mutual agreement was calculated by equation (1) (below) and the 
reliability was determined by equation (2). As shown in Table 3, the degree of agreement 
between the researcher and each of the experts was 0.94, 0.94, 0.89, 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94. The 
reliability index was 0.987. Both of these were greater than 0.70, which implies acceptable 
reliability (Weber, 1985; Kolbe & Burnett, 1991).

Figure 2. Function attribute analysis diagram 
In Figure 2, service system effectiveness (UF 1) is required to meet senior citizens’ needs 
(UF 2). The analysis suggests that the best way is to offer service automation (UF 3), which 
enables senior citizens to access sufficient self-services (such as remote medical system, smart 
electronic medicine boxes, and electric vehicles). However, service automation also brings the 
problem of cost increases (HF 1) as a consequence of equipment consumption costs, set-up costs, 
and maintenance costs. As shown in Figure 2, UF 3 (service automation) and UF 4 (equipment 
maintenance) will worsen HF 1 (service system cost) while enhancing the effectiveness of the 
service system. 
In the second step, problem formulation analyses the service-system conflict problems into 
series of simple formulas, which enables systematic detection of the conflict between harmful 
and useful functions. According to the function attribute analysis diagram, which includes: the 
home-care service system, there exists a cause-and-effect relationship among UF 3 (service 
automation), UF 4 (equipment maintenance), UF 1 (improving service system effectiveness), and 
HF 1 (increasing service system cost). Two problem statements can be formulated as follows: 
* Find a way to resolve the contradiction that UF 3 (service automation) should be 
established to enhance UF 2 (quickly meeting senior citizens’ needs), but that this will 
cause worsening of HF 1 (increasing service system cost). 
* Find a way to resolve the contradiction that UF 4 (equipment maintenance) should be 
established to enhance UF 3 (service automation), but that this will cause worsening of 
HF 1 (increasing service system cost). 
The first problem statement indicates that the home-care service system generates a conflict 
between UF 3 (service automation) and HF 1 (increasing service system cost). The conflict 
indicates that service automation can immediately satisfy senior citizens’ demands, but that this 
increases costs in purchasing and setting up the automated equipment. 
The second problem statement indicates that this home-care service system generates a 
conflict between UF 4 (equipment maintenance) and HF 1 (increasing service system cost). This 
is because home-care service agencies need to pay additional costs in manpower, transportation, 
and maintenance to maintain automated service equipment. Improvement in the effectiveness of 
the home-care service system thus implies assistance with regard to service automation and 
support of equipment maintenance. It becomes necessary to improve service automation and 
equipment maintenance, as well as to minimise cost.

The fourth inventive solution was inventive principle No. 19 (‘Periodic action’), which 
refers to using periodic actions, rather than continuous action. Applying this to ageing-in-place, 
agency managers could utilise information communication technology to ensure periodic 
maintenance of the dwellings of senior citizens and to maintain medical equipment (such as 
battery replacement in electric cars, tyre mileages, and so on). The principle of periodic action 
can also be applied to indoor lighting systems to enable the illumination level to be decreased 
automatically at certain times (such as rest times) and increased at other times (such as working 
or reading times) (Akay, et al., 2008). These suggestions can minimise unnecessary costs 
associated with continuous services. 
The fifth inventive solution was inventive principle No. 23 (‘Feedback’), which refers to 
feedback mechanisms to improve a process or action. Applying this principle to ageing-in-place, 
agencies should establish an integrated feedback mechanism that automatically records the needs 
and health conditions of senior citizens, as well as triggering response mechanisms for hospital 
and ageing-in-place agencies. Such an integrated feedback mechanism enables managers and 
doctors to deliver more appropriate care services to the dwellings of senior citizens. Staff 
members providing services could also record the opinions of clients regarding deficiencies in the 
services being provided. Such feedback mechanisms would enable agencies to provide 
appropriate care services and improve service effectiveness while minimising costs. In addition, 
from the seniors’ ergonomics perspective, medical equipments should set feedback devices to 
provide step-by-step guidelines with messages, visual icons and voice for reminding seniors 
(Chabukswar, et al., 2003; Kuo & Wang, 2007; Na, 2009; Park, 2011). This way can allow that 
seniors correctly use medical equipments and avoid seniors’ operational errors and hazards. 
Finally, the sixth inventive solution was inventive principle No. 28 (‘Replacement of 
mechanical system’). Applying this to ageing-in-place, electronic medical boxes could adopt 
acoustic and touch design (with music or vibration functions) to remind senior citizens of the 
time for their medications. Similarly, touch designs can be incorporated into electric heaters to 
provide automatic warm air when required, and bedroom light switches could adopt an acoustic 
design that responds when senior citizens get up and make a sound. The proposed suggestions, 
taking account of the ergonomics of senior citizens, have the potential to minimise the potential 
for falls and injuries.  
4.2.5 Evaluations of inventive solutions 
The six inventive solutions were then evaluated by six experts (doctors, managers, and 
consultants of ageing-in-place service agencies). These experts were requested to prioritise the 
six inventive solutions in terms of three criteria: (i) innovativeness; (ii) solving the existing 
problems; and (iii) bringing benefits to improve the service system (see Table 6). A 5-point 
Likert-type scale was used for this evaluation (1 = ‘strong disagreement’; 5 = ‘strong 
agreement’).  
The results of this evaluation are shown in Table 6. It is apparent that the order of priority 
of the six inventive solutions was: (i) dynamics; (ii) replacement of mechanical system; (iii) 
feedback; (iv) changing the colour; (v) periodic action; and (vi) segmentation. The top-three 
optimal innovative solutions (dynamics, replacement of mechanical system and feedback) should 
be preferentially implemented to invent the home-care service until solving all conflict problems 
between service quality and seniors’ need and satisfying seniors’ satisfaction. 
 15
agencies should regularly conduct surveys to understand the needs of their clients; this will 
enable managers to make optimal use of the proposed TRIZ process. 
Future studies could utilise the approach adopted here to improve services that are 
delivered by other models, such as community-care services or institution-care services. Such 
studies would also serve to validate the practicability of the model proposed here. These studies 
might develop other service-quality determinants to improve the effectiveness of the TRIZ-based 
service-system innovation model proposed here.

會議時間地點 德國科特布斯（2010/08/28～2010/09/4）  
會 議 名 稱 13th QMOD conference on Quality and Service Sciences ICQSS 2010 
發表論文題目 Developing a Benchmarking-based Business Excellence Model 
報告內容應包括下列各項：  
一、參加會議經過 
 
08/28 早上八點左右從台北桃園國際機場搭乘長榮航空至曼谷轉機，再飛往荷蘭阿姆斯特丹
史基浦機場，已於當地時間 7 點半左右，因飛往荷蘭阿姆斯特丹機票費較低，故選
擇阿姆斯特丹為下榻地點，但搭往荷蘭阿姆斯特丹之班機無法安排於會議開始當天
(08/30)抵達，而且從荷蘭阿姆斯特丹搭往會議地點德國科特布斯所需時間將近七個
小時，故提早兩天出發。8/28當晚進駐阿姆斯特丹青年旅舍。 
 
08/29 於阿姆斯特丹青年旅舍享用早餐後，驅車前往德國科特布斯，與瑞典Linköping 
University教授Dr. Professor Dahlgaard夫婦碰見共進晚餐，Linköping University與元智
大學已簽定國際交流合約，並於99學年度第一學期在工業工程與管理系所開設的卓
越經營課程擔任特聘教授，故本次除了參與13th QMOD conference on Quality and 
Service Sciences ICQSS 2010研討會外，也希望於研討會前後洽談卓越經營課程內
容，增加雙方互動關係。當晚進駐研討會安排之Lindner Congress Hotel Cottbus飯
店。 
 
08/30 於飯店用餐後，即前往會議召開地點德國科特布斯布蘭登堡大學報到並領取會議資
料，此次研討會有四場 Keynote Speeches，每場有兩位教授演講，而論文發表共分成
六個場次每場有十二篇論文發表。開幕典禮係由兩位演講者，分別為來自於美國邁
阿密大學的 Professor Parasuraman，講題為  “Service Productivity, Quality and 
Innovation: Implications for Service-Design Practice and Research”。以及另一位講者來
自於新加坡大學的 Professor Goh，講題為” Six Sigma: Its Triumphs and Tragedies”，演
講完之後隨即展開論文發表。本人與學生合作的論文被安排於下午四點三十分發
表，報告之題目為” Developing a Benchmarking-based Business Excellence Model”，論
文由本人所帶的學生親自報告，報告過程非常順利，由於時間有限因此主持人僅讓
與會人員提出 1-2個問題，則由本人逐一的答覆。當天論文發表後，於七點半研討會
安排 Diesel Power美術館裡舉辦歡迎會，讓與會者於用餐過程中群聚交流，餐後帶領
大家參訪此美術館，相當有意義。 
 
08/31 於飯店享用早餐後，仍前往布蘭登堡大學聆聽 Keynote Speech，今日仍有兩位教授
演講，分別為來自於德國 Kaiserslautern 大學的 Professor Zink，講題為  “The 
Contribution of Quality of Work to Organizational Excellence and Sustainability”。以及另 
一位講者為波蘭 Poznan大學的校長 Professor Hamrol，講題為” From Improvement to
