中文摘要 
多目標遺傳演算法（multi-objective genetic 
algorithm, MOGA）在解決多目標最佳化問題
上，已有許多成功案例。可變長度多目標遺
傳演算法使染色體長度得以不同與允許變動，
這項能力對於解決一些具有不定量性質的問
題有相當大的幫助。但是，傳統的操作子無
法適用於可變長度的個體，這些操作子需要
特別的設計以適合可變長度的多目標遺傳演
算法。 
本計畫提出一個新的可變長度多目標遺傳
演算法。在設計上，我們提出一個新的變動
長度的表示法以及一個複合式交換子
（hybrid crossover）以處理不同長度染色體
的交換；透過這個複合式交換子，基因及染
色體長度均可被改變。整體來說，我們所提
出的可變長度多目標遺傳演算法具有多目標
最佳化的能力、克服了制訂不定量性質的困
難、以及解決可變長度表示法所引起的交換
子操作問題。 
此外，本計畫更將所提出的可變長度多目
標遺傳演算法應用於異質無線網路發射台佈
建問題。首先，可變長度的機制允許在最佳
化過程中使用不確定的發射台數量，毋須事
先訂定發佈台數量或其上限值。再者，這演
算法的多目標最佳化能力可同時追求多項目
標：最大覆蓋率、最低成本(最少發射台)、
最小傳輸需求差異、與最小重疊率。在六個
模擬實驗中，我們所提出的方法均能找到最
佳的發射台數量，同時達到超過 98%的覆蓋
率。這些優異表現證明了此方法的效用。 
英文摘要 
Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs) 
have achieved success in dealing with optimi-
zation problems with more than one objective. 
Variable-length MOGAs enable different and 
variable chromosome lengths, which are very 
helpful to solve the problems with uncertain 
number of properties. However, traditional 
genetic operators cannot apply to varia-
ble-length chromosomes. These operators need 
to be specially designed to adapt to varia-
ble-length MOGAs. 
This project proposed a novel mul-
ti-objective variable-length genetic algorithm 
(MOVLGA). In the design, we presented a 
new variable-length representation and a hybr-
id crossover to handle the crossover operation 
on chromosomes with unequal lengths. Using 
the hybrid crossover, the genes and the chro-
mosome lengths can be changed. The proposed 
MOVLGA, as a whole, holds the capability of 
multi-objective optimization, overcomes the 
difficulty in determining uncertain quantity of 
properties, and resolves the issue of crossover 
operators for variable-length representation. 
In addition to design, the project applied the 
proposed MOVLGA to solve the heterogene-
ous wireless transmitter placement problem. 
First, the variable-length mechanism allows an 
indefinite number of transmitters in the opti-
mization process, needless to predefine the 
number of transmitters or its upper bound. 
Second, the multi-objective optimization capa-
bility of MOVLGA can simultaneously pursue 
multiple objectives: maximum coverage rate, 
this study is to find the optimal placement of 
transmitters for four objectives: 1) maximum 
coverage; 2) minimum cost; 3) maximum ca-
pacity satisfaction; 4) minimum overlap. To 
solve this wireless transmitter placement prob-
lem, three issues are of paramount importance 
but remain open: the number of transmitters, 
the heterogeneity of networks, and the multip-
licity of objectives. The proposed algorithm 
not only can solve this problem without 
pre-determining the number of transmitters or 
its upper bound, but it also can achieve high 
coverage rate, high capacity satisfaction, and 
low overlap. 
2. 文獻探討 
Some heuristic methods have been developed 
for solving the base station placement problem. 
Unbehaun et al. [20] selected a set of candidate 
WLAN access points using the pruning method 
and refined these access points via a neigh-
borhood search and simulated annealing. Lee 
and Kang [21] utilized tabu search to increase 
the capacity of CDMA. In focusing on the 
UMTS uplink, Amaldi et al. [22] developed a 
randomized greedy method with tabu search to 
avoid local optima for WLAN coverage plan-
ning. In addition, several approaches based on 
evolutionary computation have shown their 
power in effectively tackling the transmitter 
placement problem. Weicker et al. [23] pro-
posed the steady state evolutionary algorithm 
with Pareto tournaments (stEAPT), which con-
siders frequency assignment and channel in-
terference for base station placement. Zhang et 
al. [24] designed a multi-objective particle 
swarm optimization on coverage and cost ob-
jectives. Park et al. [25][26] applied a genetic 
algorithm to optimize the total number of 
transmitters and their positions. Experimental 
results show the utility of genetic algorithm on 
the base station placement problem. 
The antenna placement problem is to assign 
antennas to certain sites selected from a set of 
predefined candidate sites and determine the 
parameters of antennas for particular objec-
tives and constraints. Reininger and Caminada 
[27] formulated the antenna placement prob-
lem for cellular networks. Their model has 
three objectives—minimum cost, maximum 
traffic capacity, and minimal overlapping crite-
ria—and three constraints—link budget, han-
dover, and connectivity. To address this prob-
lem, Vasquez and Hao [28] proposed a 
three-stage heuristic approach. The pre-process 
filters out poor solutions; the tabu search opti-
mizes the configuration; the post-process im-
proves the results through tabu search. Simula-
tion results for urban and highway networks 
demonstrated the capability of the heuristic 
approach. Hurley [29] considered traffic, han-
dover, and transmitter and proposed an algo-
rithm based on simulated annealing. Zimmer-
mann et al. [30] integrated multiple objectives 
using scalarization; that is, they combined 
three objectives into one weighted objective. 
The (1+1)-evolutionary strategy has been 
adopted to solve the constrained sin-
gle-objective optimization problem. Beyond 
scalarization, Raisanen and Whitaker [31] ad-
dressed the problem using several prominent 
multi-objective optimization algorithms, in-
cluding SEAMO, SPEA2, NSGA II, and PESA. 
They concluded that NSGA II [32] can achieve 
the best performance. Raisanen [33] further 
employed a permutation-coded representation 
for the problem concerning the objectives of 
service coverage, cost, traffic capacity, han-
dover, and interference. Experimental results 
for three realistic simulated environments 
showed that NSGA II using the permuta-
tion-coded strategy outperforms that using 
common binary-coded representation or integ-
er-based representation. 
3. 研究方法 
3.1 Problem Statement 
This section defines the wireless heterogene-
ous transmitter placement problem. Note that 
this study focuses on the placement of trans-
mitters for Wi-Fi and WiMAX networks. 
coverage 𝑇 =
1
|𝑅|
 covered(𝑟)
𝑟∈𝑅
 . (4) 
Note that the objective is to maximize cover-
age. 
Cost: Another objective is to minimize cost 
in placing the set of transmitters T. Here cost is 
evaluated by summing the individual costs of 
all transmitters. 
cost 𝑇 =  𝑐𝑡
𝑡∈𝑇
 , (5) 
where 𝑐𝑡  denotes the cost of transmitter 𝑡 
with type 𝜏𝑡 =  𝑝𝑡 , 𝑐𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 ∈ 𝑇𝑃. 
Capacity: This study adopts the notion of 
data rate to assess the network capacity [37]. 
An ideal network design should provide just 
sufficient bandwidth (data rate) for users; both 
oversupply and shortage of bandwidth are not 
satisfactory. Thus, the objective regarding ca-
pacity is formulated to minimize the absolute 
difference between the transmitter bandwidth 
and the sum of data rate demands of its cov-
ered receivers. 
∆capacity 𝑇 =   𝑠𝑡 −  𝜎𝑟
𝑟∈𝑅:𝑆𝑟 ,𝑡>𝜃𝑟
 
𝑡∈𝑇
 , (6) 
where 𝑠𝑡  is the data rate provided by trans-
mitter 𝑡  of type 𝜏𝑡 =  𝑝𝑡 , 𝑐𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 ∈ 𝑇𝑃  and 
𝜎𝑟  is the data rate demand of receiver 𝑟. 
Overlap: Coverage overlap between trans-
mitters raises the issue of interference [23][38]. 
To reduce the interference, we use an addition-
al objective to minimize the overlap. The ob-
jective function counts the number of receivers 
covered by more than one transmitter. 
overlap 𝑇 =  overlapped(𝑟)
𝑟∈𝑅
 (7) 
with 
overlapped 𝑟 =  
1,     𝐴𝑆(𝑟) > 1
0,    otherwise   
  (8) 
where active set 𝐴𝑆(𝑟) represents the set of 
transmitters by which receiver 𝑟 is covered. 
F. The Problem 
The wireless transmitter placement problem 
in this study is formally defined as a mul-
ti-objective minimization problem: 
min 𝑓1, 𝑓2 , 𝑓3 , 𝑓4 : 
   𝑓1 = 1 − coverage 𝑇  
   𝑓2 = cost 𝑇  
   𝑓3 = ∆capacity 𝑇  
   𝑓4 = overlap(𝑇) 
 
(9a) 
(9b) 
(9c) 
(9d) 
(9e) 
To minimize four objectives, (9b) transforms 
the objective for maximum coverage into that 
for minimum percentage of areas that are not 
covered, namely 1 − coverage(𝑇). 
3.2 The Proposed Algorithm 
This project presented a novel variable-length 
representation and variation operators, and in-
tegrates them into a multi-objective genetic 
algorithm based on NSGA II. The algorithm 
NSGA II [32] is known for its effectiveness in 
dealing with multi-objective problems; in par-
ticular, Raisanen and Whitaker [31] validated 
that NSGA II performs best in comparison 
with SEAMO, SPEA2, and PESA on the an-
tenna placement problem. This project accor-
dingly adopts NSGA II as the scheme for mul-
ti-objective optimization. Additionally, the 
proposed representation and crossover facili-
tate varying chromosome length and informa-
tion, i.e., the number, positions, and types of 
transmitters. Consequently, the proposed algo-
rithm can search for the appropriate number of 
transmitters automatically and optimize the 
positions and types of transmitters for maxi-
mum coverage, minimum cost, maximum ca-
pacity satisfaction, and minimum overlap. 
change several substrings without modifying 
the bits in each substring; and, a probability 
𝑃𝑐 × (1 − 𝑃𝑐) to exchange both bits and sub-
strings. More details about the operation of 
these crossovers are given below. 
The uniform crossover for substrings fol-
lows the operation of uniform crossover but 
limits the scope of the crossover to a substring 
rather than the whole chromosome. Figure 3 
presents an example of the crossover, where 
the bits of offspring are equiprobably inherited 
from parent 1 or parent 2. Notably, the cros-
sover changes transmitter position and type.  
A special scheme is developed to perform 
uniform crossover on chromosomes of differ-
ent lengths. Figure 4 illustrates this procedure. 
First, the lengths of both chromosomes are 
compared. In the example, parent 1 has four 
substrings while parent 2 has five substrings. 
To deal with unequal of chromosome lengths, 
the shorter chromosome, parent 1, randomly 
maps its substrings to the longer chromosome, 
parent 2. The uniform crossover for substrings 
can then be performed on the four pairs of 
mapped substrings for parents 1 and 2. 
Another crossover to apply is the one-point 
crossover for chromosomes. First, a chromo-
some is divided into two parts at a random 
point between substrings. Second, the two 
parts are exchanged with each other. Figure 5 
shows parent 1 exchanging its part with parent 
2. This strategy allows chromosomes to alter 
their lengths. 
F. Mutation 
All mutation operators for binary-coded 
GAs are applicable to the proposed algorithm. 
This work adopts the bit-flip mutation with a 
mutation rate 𝑃𝑚 = 1/𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔_𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡𝑕 ; 
therefore, each bit has a probability of 𝑃𝑚  to 
be flipped.

4.2 Benchmark 6 
Benchmark 6 is an outdoor wireless heteroge-
neous transmitter placement problem. The map 
of benchmark 6 is a real map (Fig. 8) sampled 
from Google Earth for a 1.8 × 1.5km2 divi-
sion of the Kaohsiung city in Taiwan. The map 
includes a natural barrier, the Shou Mountain; 
and an artificial barrier, the Kaohsiung harbor. 
Transmitters cannot be placed in the regions of 
mountain and harbor. In addition, the mountain 
has an altitude 355m and no signal can pene-
trate the mountain; on the other hand, the har-
bor allows signals pass through the region. 
There are three classes of data rate demands 
among total 3057 receivers: 2478 receivers of 
16Kbps, 420 receivers of 128Kbps, and 159 
receivers of 1024Kbps. Simulating Wi-Fi and 
WiMAX networks, the benchmark has two 
transmitter types for placement. The first 
transmitter type has a power radius of 1500m, 
a cost of 40000, and a capability of 75Mbps; 
the second transmitter type has a power radius 
of 100m, a cost of 2200, and a capability of 
54Mbps. 
Due to the computation complexity, this 
work conducts only one trial of the proposed 
algorithm using population size 500 with 2000 
generations on benchmark 6. The simulation 
results in Figs. 10 and 11 demonstrate that the 
proposed algorithm can generate diverse solu-

lem, Slijepcevic and Potkonjak [11] developed the most constrained-minimally constraining covering
heuristic (MCMCC). The MCMCC approach takes only polynomial time but often yields unsatisfac-
tory results. Cardei and Du [5] created the Disjoint Set Covers (DSC) problem, which is equivalent
to the SET K-COVER problem. They presented a heuristic algorithm called maximum covers using
mixed integer programming (MCMIP) to solve the DSC problem. The MCMIP method guarantees
achieving the optimal solution through an implicit exhaustive search and thus requires exponential
running time. This computationally expensive cost forbids its use in large-scale problems. Berman
et al. [4] additionally considered the knowledge of initial battery power and energy consumption
rate for each sensor. The disjoint constraint of covers is relaxed so that each sensor can participate
in different sensor covers as long as it still has energy. The authors formulated the sensor network
lifetime problem (SNLP) of finding a monitoring schedule with the maximum length of time. An
(1 + ln(1 − q)−1)-approximation algorithm was also proposed for the case that a q-portion of the
monitored area must be covered.
The above approaches render solutions for the SET K-COVER problem; however, they suffer
from the trade-off between solution quality and running time. For example, the unsatisfactory
solution quality of MCMCC detracts from its efficiency. On the other hand, MCMIP guarantees
finding the optimum solutions at the cost of exponential time complexity. To address this issue,
Lai et al. [9] designed an integer-coded genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed GA can achieve
near-optimal solutions in acceptable running time. Nevertheless, this GA requires an upper bound
for the number of covers due to the integer representation of chromosomes, and its performance is
subject to this upper bound. A method that can deliver good solution quality in limited running
time and needs no upper bound or assumptions about the maximum number of covers is needed to
solve the SET K-COVER problem.
2 The Proposed Method
In this paper, we propose a tabu search (TS) method combined with random walk to address the
SET K-COVER problem of extending WSN lifetime. More specifically, the TS is based on an order-
based, instead of integer, representation of candidate solutions to eliminate the requirement for the
upper bound. In addition, a random walk mechanism is devised for the TS to diversify the search
behavior.
Tabu search is a metaheuristic that has widely proven effective in solving optimization prob-
lems, particularly in combinatorial problems [6, 7, 8]. This metaheuristic uses explicit memory
structure to record the search trajectory. According to its “forbiddance-versus-permission” tactic
based on the recorded information, TS guides the search in consideration of both intensification and
diversification. The basics of TS are listed below.
1. Move: The process from a candidate solution to another, e.g., the process from the current
solution to its neighbor.
2. Neighborhood : The set of candidate solutions that are related to the current solution. The
Hamming distance is commonly used to define the range of neighborhood.
3. Tabu list : A memory structure used to record the forbidden moves. This is the most salient
feature of TS. The concept of tabu list is to prevent the search from being mired in the local

Figure 1: Example representation of candidate solution
this study represents a candidate solution as an “order” of sensors to be collected for covers. For
example, the candidate solution in Fig. 1 indicates an collecting order: S2, S5, and so forth. After
collecting S2, S5, and S1, the first cover C1 is formed since {S2, S5, S1} covers all the targets. Next,
the collecting process continues with sensor S3 for a new cover C2. Note that in this example C2
cannot form a cover in that the remaining {S3, S4} does not cover T1. This representation has two
advantages. First, it always satisfies the constraint that the covers must be disjoint since each sensor
can be assigned to only one cover. Second, the representation does not require an upper bound or
assumptions about the maximum number K of covers.
Further, this study adopts swap as the neighborhood function for the order-based representation
of candidate solutions. The neighborhood N(x) of current solution x therefore represents the set of
all variants of x generated by one swap. For example, {5,2, 1, 3, 4} and {2, 5,4, 3,1} are neighbors
of candidate solution {2, 5, 1, 3, 4} in Fig. 1. Note that N(x) has (n2) elements for x with n variables
in the SET K-COVER problem.
2.2 Evaluation Function
The evaluation function is used to assess the goodness of a candidate solution. For the SET K-
COVER problem, the evaluation function can simply consider the number of obtained covers. For
instance, the evaluation of the candidate solution in Fig. 1 is one since it forms only one cover.
This evaluation function, however, does not take the composition of covers into account: Redundant
sensors for certain covers cannot be reflected by this evaluation fitness.
This study proposes a new evaluation function based on the contribution of each sensor. The
contribution of a sensor to a cover is defined by the increment in the number of targets caused by
this sensor. For instance, in Fig. 1 sensors S2 and S1 have contributions of 2 and 1, respectively,
since S2 covers two targets and S1 covers one target in addition. The candidate solution then has

somewhat differ in number of covers obtained between sensing ranges of r ≤ 200 and r > 200. For
r ≤ 200, it shows that
MCMIP > TS (p > 0) > MCMCC > TS (p = 0) > HC > iGA .
For r > 200,
MCMIP > TS (p > 0) > TS (p = 0) > MCMCC > HC > iGA .
Table 2 further presents the one-tailed paired t-test results between TS and other algorithms. These
results show that the proposed TS with random walk (p > 0) can significantly outperform other test
algorithms except MCMIP in number of covers obtained. Among the four settings for probability p,
TS with p = 0.3 generally performs best; however, the difference in number of covers obtained
between p = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 is not significant. As for TS without random walk, namely, TS
(p = 0), it achieves fewer covers for r ≤ 200 but more for r > 200 than MCMCC does. The
simulation results also reveal the ineffectiveness of integer-coded GA, which generates fewest covers
on average. This demonstrates the superiority of local search methods (HC and TS) over global
search method (iGA) on the SET K-COVER problem.
Regarding success rate, TS with random walk achieves higher than 94% for all sensing ranges.
Especially, TS with p = 0.3 accounts for higher than 98% success rate on all the simulations,
which is comparable to MCMIP. In addition, Fig. 2 demonstrates the advantage of random walk
in improving TS: TS with p > 0 significantly outperforms TS with p = 0 in number of covers
obtained and success rate. The MCMCC achieves 100% and 96% success rates for r = 100 and 150,
respectively. Nonetheless, its success rate decreases as sensing ranges increases. This deterioration
also appears in iGA, HC, and TS (p = 0). Conversely, the increase in sensing range exerts little effect
on the performance of TS with random walk. Such robustness validates the benefit of perturbation
introduced by random walk to TS.
In the light of efficiency, MCMCC is the fastest of all test algorithms whereas MCMIP is the slow-
est. This outcome shows the trade-off between solution quality and running time: MCMIP achieves
the maximum number of covers at the cost of exponentially increasing running time; MCMCC runs
fast but has a low probability to gain the maximum. The proposed TS with random walk can
effectively resolve this trade-off. It achieves comparable numbers of covers and success rates but
requires much shorter time than MCMIP. This excellent performance in solution quality outweighs
the slightly longer running time than MCMCC. Concerning the impact of random walk on running
time, the setting of p = 0.1 has similar running time with that of p = 0. However, for p > 0.1, the
impact is inconclusive.
4 Conclusions
This study proposes the TS with random walk to deal with the SET K-COVER problem of extending
WSN lifetime. The proposed TS represents candidate solutions by the collecting order of sensors
for covers. This representation owns the advantage of always satisfying the constraint of cover
disjointedness. According to the tabu restriction and aspiration criterion, the TS conducts a local
search that is capable of preventing cycling around local optima. In addition, the proposed TS
probabilistically undertakes a random walk to enhance the search diversity.
Simulations with different sensing ranges in WSN are carried out to evaluate the proposed TS, in
comparison with MCMIP, MCMCC, integer-coded GA, and hill climbing. The comparative results
