2. Abstract 
 
This project includes four subprojects. (1) design and fabrication of a high 
performance micro proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack. The effect of 
different operating parameters on micro PEM fuel cells performances was 
experimentally studied for different channel-to-rib width ratios of flowfield plates 
configurations (co-flow design). The micro PEM fuel cells were designed and 
fabricated in-house through a deep UV lithography technique and the SU-8 
photoresist was used as microstructure mold for fuel cell flowfield plates when micro 
electroforming. In this study, the performance test (VI and PI curve) were carried out 
to get in information on examining the effect of the serpentine flowfield patterns, as 
well as the operational parameters such as different cell temperature, backpressure of 
micro PEM fuel cells. Experimental results are presented in the form of polarization 
VI curves and PI curves under above operating conditions. The influence of the 
aforementioned parameters was presented and discussed. (2) Design and fabrication 
the methanol reformer to offer fuels for the micro PEM fuel cells, (3) numerical 
analysis of heat and mass transfer in a microchannel PEM fuel cell reformer, and (4) 
interface reliability analysis of MEA and flowfield plates during operating process, as 
well as evaluates bonding strength of the interface. Using these results of subprojects 
can assist us to understand and to promote the PEM fuel cell studies in the future 
 4
and is employed in most fuel-cell reformer. The study of methanol reforming with 
CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst to product hydrogen. Also studied methanol reforming but 
with a 33nm Cu layer as catalyst in their micro reactor. Further included steam 
reforming and pre-oxidation processes in a methanol reformer study and provided 
chemical reaction rate for methanol steam reform process. A study of micro-channel 
water gas reactor for fuel processing application. Based on this theory, fuel cell has 
the advantage to reduce air pollution and slow down global warming. Therefore, fuel 
cell has drawn the most attention recently. 
 
4. Missions achieved 
 
z Sample (including flow channel) preparation 
One of the most frequently used in commercial market flow channels, serpentine 
flow type channel with varying rib widths was microfabricated. Fig. 1 shows five 
different flowfields were used in the present experiments with rib width of 150, 250, 
300, 450, and 600 µm with a definite channel width (300 µm). The resulting 
channel-to-rib width ratio is listed in Table 1 with relevant geometric variables of the 
channel. Following Hsieh et al. [8], the flowfield plates were fabricated with copper 
metal sheets by using LIGA-like (LIGA; a German acronym for lithographie 
galvanoformung abformung) microfabrication process of deep ultraviolet (UV) 
lithography to obtain SU-8 (2100) resist patterns/and SU-8 mould [8]. 
 
z Reliability and durability examination 
As stately previously, the single cell performance was tested for long range runs 
(> 2 months) and each test lasts at least 5 hrs. The VI/PI curves for all five different 
cases were examined as show in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2(b) shows open circuit voltage (OCV) 
profiles history for 5 hours and it clearly suggests that the present copper sheet 
flowfield plates perform very well as far as the reliability and durability are concerned, 
which suggests the copper corrosion rate appears of no significance. Further 
inspection of this behavior can be done via an SEM examination of the used flowfield 
plates after two months as shown in Fig. 2(c). 
 
z Optimal channel-to-rib width ratio vs VI/PI curves and pressure drop 
The electrode-electrolyte assemblies were investigated in a fuel cell. Purified 
(99.9%) and dry hydrogen is fed into the cell from a gas cylinder through a mass flow 
meter and back-pressure valve and compressed air was provided. The inlet flow rate 
of dry H2 and air were regulated at 10 and 50 sccm, respectively, under different back 
pressures of 97, 153, and 207 kPa. These parameters also listed in Table 2 were

5. Conclusions 
 
z Sample (including flow channel) preparation 
Fig. 3 shows the brief fabrication steps with proper parameters as listed in Table 
2. Figs. 4(a) to (e) show the images of a scanning examination microscope (SEM) and 
an atomic force microscope (AFM) examination, respectively. All samples had an 
active area of 2.25 cm long and 2.25 cm wide (5cm2). The flow channel was 2.25 cm 
long. 
 
z Reliability and durability examination 
While for the rib surface, the growth of the oxide layer can clearly be noted and 
the growth rate was found to be about 0.06 µm/hr. Based on the observation, one can 
conclude that the corrosion problems of copper metal flowfield plates can be 
considered negligible. In fact, we found that water flooding in reactant gas channels 
may occur and becomes more severe as time goes on. Further study are essentially 
needed for water disposal or recycle and related issues. Basically, the used channel 
surface became more flat than that of the initial surface condition, due to the deposits 
filling into some small cavities on the surface of the originals. 
 
z Optimal channel-to-rib width ratio vs VI/PI curves and pressure drop 
Fig. 5 further extracted the previous results of pressure drop to obtain the friction 
factor for all five cases under study. The friction factor calculation was based on the 
known Darcy-Weisbach formula and the data on both anode/cathode flow channel 
was plotted as shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b), respectively, against the channel-to-rib 
width ratio at Tcell =25°C and Panode = Pcathode = 97 kPa. It is found that the friction 
factor value nearly constant on each flow channel; it is about 9.8-9.9 on anode; while 
on cathode is about 0.28-0.29. Also included in Fig. 5 are the pressure drop 
distribution on anode/cathode for reference. Since the present flow condition is still in 
continuum flow region (i.e. Kn ≈ 0, see Table 1 for details), the friction factor 
obtained can be compared with those conventional empirical friction factor (f) 
formula (f = 60.4/Re) for laminar flow with the same Reynolds number. It is found 
that the deviation is very small (< 8%), which again, strongly suggests and also 
verifies the validity of the present pressure drop measurements for both anode/cathode 
flow channel. 
 
z Design and fabrication of the reformer 
The experimental results have shown that the existences of water in reaction do 
help the CO conversion, especially for the case of 5%Pt catalyst. Existence of water 
also reduces the methanation phenomenon of all catalysts in experiments at high
