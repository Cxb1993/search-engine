Comprehending all of the above chelating mechanisms and the unique character of 
nanobeads for their small size, great surface area and quantum size effect, the heavy 
metal ions are almost completely retained by chitosan nanobeads. The formation of a 
chitosan chelate with Pb2+ ion is shown in figure 1.  
 
AC electric charging operation 
The classical theoretical model can be shown that the time-averaged dielectrophoretic 
force acting a spherical bead is give by Jones [15], FDEP = 2r3mRe{K（）}▽Erms2, 
where r is the radius of the bead, Erms the root mean square value of the electric field 
(assume a sinusoidal time dependence), and Re{K（）} is not only depends on the 
dielectric properties of the bead and medium, but also on the frequency of the applied 
field. It is defined as the real part of the Clausius-Mossotti factor, K（）= (b* - 
m*)/(b* + m*). Here the (*) denotes that the dielectric constant is a complex quantity. 
The complex permittivities of the bead and the medium b* and m*, respectively, are 
defined as * = j（/2）, j=√-1, where  is the permittivity, is the conductivity, 
and is the frequency of the applied AC electric field. Variations in this factor give rise 
to a dielectrophoretic force that is frequency dependent and unique to a particular bead 
type. For the spherical chelating beads, the Re{K（）} is bounded by the limits -1/2＜
Re{K（）}＜1  and the varies with the frequency of the applied field and the complex 
permittivity of the medium. Positive dielectrophoresis (p-DEP, b ＞m) occurs when 
Re{K（）}＞0, the force is toward the high electric field. Comparatively, the converse 
of this is negative dielectrophoresis (n-DEP, b ＜ m), which occurs when Re{K（）}
＜0, the dielectrophoretic force will hence repel the bead towards the direction of 
decreasing field strength, as shown in figure 2. In the other hand, due to the nature of the 
cell membrane and biconcave morphology, the classical spherical model must be 
modified in order to describe the polarization mechanics of real living cells. As proposed 
by Hoeber [27], a real living erythrocyte cell cannot simply be described by the simply 
dielectric single spherical model, but is, however, well described as an oblate sphere of 
highly conducting cytoplasm surrounded by an insulating membrane. As the CM factor, 
K（）, used in the DEP force expression is valid only for homogeneous spherical cells, 
it is necessary to modify this factor taking into account both the spheroidal shape and 
low-conductive cell membrane of the living erythrocyte cell. Irimajiri [28] had modified 
a model with a multi-shelled Maxwell-Wagner (MW) theory in order to approximate the 
dielectric polarization of biological cells suspended in an electrolyte solution. Here, we 
better approximate the biconcave shape of an erythrocyte cell as an oblate spheroid. For 
the case a single-shell oblate spheroid with major axis aligned parallel with the applied 
field, the modified CM factor can be shown to be  K（）MW = Vc m (c’-m*) / [(c’-m*) 
Aop+m*]. The parameter Aop describes the geometry specific degree to which the exterior 
of the cell, from the outer membrane edge to infinity, depolarizes along the principal axis, 
Vc represents the cell volume, and c’ is the effective permittivity of the cell given by c’ 
= mem {mem +(cyto - mem)[ Aip +v(1- Aop)]} / {mem +(cyto - mem)[ Aip - vAop]}, 
where mem and cyto are the complex permittivity’s of the cell membrane and cytoplasm, 
respectively, Aip describes the depolarization from just the membrane to infinity, v 
(which is v = r2c / [(r + d)2 (c + d)] ) is the volume ratio of the cell exterior to interior, r 
the cell radius, c the cell half-length, and d is the membrane thickness. In the case of an 
erythrocyte cell, d is approximately three orders of magnitude less than r and c, and thus 
the approximation that Aop = Aip can be made, and a useful expansion of this factor can 
 temperature in the blood serum can be estimated as ∆T ~ V2 / (m cp U). Gradients in 
temperature produce gradients in permittivity and conductivity in the bloodstream flow. 
For the continuous bloodstream flow (1/)(∂∂T) = +1% and  (1/)(∂∂T) = +0.5% per 
degree Kelvin. [31] These variations in electric properties will have a minimal effect on 
the continuous bloodstream flow owing to the increasing temperature generated by the 
moving blood serum medium. Thus, the high-intensity AC electric fields which are 
associated with dielectrophoresis (DEP) to generate a nonuniform temperature field can 
be ignored in the continuous bloodstream flow. 
 
Experimental Procedure 
Preparation of nano-beads and serum fluid 
Sample of chitosan with average molecular weights 105-106 and with minimum 85% 
degree of N-deacetylation prepared form crab shells were obtained from SIGMA C3646 
(SIGMA-ALDRICH CHEMIE Inc., Steinheim Germany). Chitosan nano-particles were 
ground by using a high-energy nano-ball-milling machine sieved to a consistent particle 
size ( ＜ 1m) before use. All the reagents used were of analytical reagent grade. 
Deionized water with a conductivity of 18.2 Mcm-1 was used to prepare all the 
solutions. Chitosan solution was prepared by dissolving 20.0 mg of chitosan 
nanoparticles into 40 ml of 5% acetic acid solution. The chitosan solution was sprayed 
into a precipitation bath containing 250ml of 0.5M NaOH, which neutralized the acetic 
acid within the chitosan gel and thereby coagulated the chitosan gel to spherical uniform 
chitosan gel beads (db ≈ 800-1000 nm). The aqueous NaOH solution was stirred using a 
magnetic stirrer. The wet chitosan gel beads were extensively rinsed with deionized water 
to remove any NaOH, and finally the solution was treated with super-filtration membrane 
to remove the residual particles. Chitosan nanobreads were stored up in deionized water. 
The fabrication of the chitosan nanobead is shown in figure 3.  
Contaminated bloodstream with lead (II) was prepared by dissolving 2.00 ml of aqueous 
Pb2+ ion solution (30ppd concentration) into 100 ml human blood serum. The aqueous 
Pb2+ ion solution was easily to be obtained by boiling aqueous PbCl solution for 2 hours. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Microfluidic-microelectric device 
The multilayer structure of the microfluidic device with the electrodes shown in figure 4 
was fabricated by bonding a polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) replica between an indium 
tin oxides (ITO) coating Pyrex glass and a silicon chip. The cross-sectional size and 
streamwise length of the channel were 300×100 m2 and 20 mm, respectively. In the 
fabrication of the PDMS replica, a microstereo lithography (-SLA) system rapidly 
directs the focused radiation of an appropriate power onto the surface of a liquid 
photopolymer resin, forming patterns of the solidified photopolymer. The feature size of

field distribution generated by microelectrodes containing long bar features. Note that a 
higher electric field occurs in the vicinity of the strip electrodes. 
 
Results and Discussion 
Dielectrophoretic force calculation 
The dielectrophoretic responses of chelating bead and erythrocytes are governed by the 
Clausius-Mossotti factor. The real part of the Clausius-Mossotti factor, Re[K（f）], 
determines the magnitude and directional sign of the movement force. The frequency 
dependence of Re[ K（f）] translates to a frequency-dependent, time average DEP force 
on a homogeneous bead. In other words, the responses of chelating bead and erythrocytes 
are predominated by conductivity and permittivity. The erythrocyte cell is bigger than 
serum for the permittivity (c＞ m), and the conductivity is much less (m＞c), 
respectively. Then the erythrocytes will be attracted to electric field intensity maxima at 
high frequencies and to minima at low frequencies. The frequency-dependent behavior of 
chelating bead reverses if m＞b and b＞m. 
The average conductivity of bead can be written as the sum of bulk and surface 
conductivity of erythrocytes, =bulk + (2Ksurface / r) [33], where Ksurface is the surface 
conductance and bulk is the bulk conductivity. The polarizability and the 
dielectrophoretic force on each bead and erythrocyte can be calculated on the basis of the 
dielectrophoretic theory and the Stokes law mentioned above. 
However, exposing erythrocyte cells to non-uniform electric fields may cause the 
membrane potential of the cells to rise rapidly. Membrane structure conformation and the 
formation of electropores are changed by increases in the potential of the angled 
membrane. Electropores increase the conductivity of the membrane, thereby protecting 
the cell. The creation of electropores was found to start at a membrane potential of 0.5-1 
V for several cell types. According to Zimmermann et al. [34], an alternating electric 
field induces a membrane potential on a cell of Vm = [1.5r Erms cos] / [1+(2)2]1/2 , 
where  is the angle between the membrane patch and the field direction, and  is the 
relaxation time of the membrane, r cmem(ip+0.5op), with ip and op denoting the 
specific resistivity of the interior and exterior of the cell, respectively, and cmem the 
specific membrane capacity. The equation is concerned with whether a change in 
membrane conductivity alters the modified Clausius-Mossotti factor significantly so that 
a difference in the total force can be observed at the lower frequencies. This project 
describes a high frequency operation, 13.56 MHz, and thus alternating electric field 
induces a membrane potential will be reduced at a stable electrical field. Following the 
above potential equation, the change of membrane conductivity in the medium can be 
estimated.

dielectrophrosis field strong enough to spatially manipulate and separate a mixture of 
chelating beads and erythrocyte cells into two distinct direction in a continuous flow 
(Re=5.0). This can clearly be observed in figure 7, which indicates the conditions under 
which chelating beads and erythrocytes attracting can be achieved at an applied power 5 
Watt. At a bloodstream medium conductivity of 1.24 Sm-1 and frequency of 13.56 MHz, 
the chelating bead experiences negative dielectrophoretic field, so that the bead moves 
toward the direction of the ITO electrode in the main fluid flow where the 
dielectrophoretic force is small. Relatively, the erythrocyte cell experiences positive 
dielectrophoretic field, so that the erythrocyte cell moves toward the direction of the strip 
electrodes in the main fluid flow where the dielectrophoretic force is strong. In this case, 
the electrodes (Fig. 7, 1-1’ section) supply enough dielectrophoretic force, the 
biopolymeric chelating nanobeads experience negetive dielectrophoretic field (NDEP) 
and move toward to the ITO electrode, whereas the erythrocytes experience positive 
dielectrophoretic field (PDEP) and move toward to the strip electrodes, so that the two 
bead types could be spatially separated in a continuous bloodstream flow. The images 
show that the erythrocytes are attracted to the high-field region of the strip electrodes, 
and the chelating beads are attracted and widely distributed to the low-field region of the 
ITO electrode in the downstream direction. The moving velocity of chelating bead and 
erythrocyte cell should be proportional to the time-averaged dielectrophoretic force, U = 
FDEP/, then Ub = rb2mRe[ K（f）] / 3μ and Uc = (2/3)r2cmRe{K（）MW }▽

Biopolymeric 
Chelating Nanobeads 
Erythrocytes 
(RBC)
dielectrophoresis, a local dielectrophoretic force obtained from nonuniform electric fields 
was used for manipulating and attracting the chelating nanobeads and blood cytoplasm in 
a continuous flow. It has been demonstrated that the deviating mobilities of beads and 
cytoplasm depend on the polarizability of the beads and cytoplasm, and this in turn is 
governed by the dielectric properties of the beads, cytoplasm, and medium. Using this 
technique, a selective adsorbing of heavy metal ions in RBC was efficiently achieved 
from the bloodstream medium, and potentially allows critical biological adsorbing 
treatment in fields outside hospitals. In addition, the latest electroporation techniques are 
being carried out in chips fully compatible with the IC fabrication process, making it 
favorable for adaptation with mass fabrication.
