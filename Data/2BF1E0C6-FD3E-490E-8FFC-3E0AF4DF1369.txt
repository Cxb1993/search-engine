「彈性工作時間制度」對「通勤出發時間選擇」及「生活時間評估」影響之研究 
 
一、前言 
人們為了滿足食、衣、住、行、育、樂等需求，必須先以勞動力換取相對報酬，爾
後才能在市場上進行交易並取得所需之商品或服務。因此，「工作(或稱上班)」成為多
數家計負擔者在平日裡最重要的「活動」。然而，對於都市交通而言，由於實施「工作
開始時刻固定制」，使都市通勤旅次集中在某些尖峰時段，並形成交通擁擠之現象。而
因交通擁擠所衍生的交通事故、空氣污染、噪音、交通成本(時間)提高等問題，亦間接
使得上班者無法獲得較佳的生活品質。為解決上述之問題，或可考慮透過採行「彈性工
作時間制度」，以分散尖峰時段之交通需求，進而達成減輕都市內交通擁擠之效果(藍
武王與陳天賜，1998；塚井等，1999)。就既往之研究成果可知，在短期交通需求管理
方面，彈性工作時間制度是相當有效的一種方法。一般而言，「彈性工作時間制度」的
導入將會直接對上班者之「通勤出發時間選擇」及「工作開始時間選擇」造成影響。是
故，在時間的安排及運用方面，透過「彈性工作時間制度」的導入，上班者將可更為有
效地來安排一日行程，不僅可避開尖峰時刻之各項負面效應，同時在「生活時間評估」
的層面上可獲得更大效用。 
一般而言，在傳統固定工作時間制度下，上班者必須遵循公司規定的上、下班時刻，
不得遲到或早退，因此固定的工作時間，必然會對其它活動的選擇造成極大的影響與制
約。然而，不同社經背景條件的上班者，對於時間的安排亦會有所不同，而隨著彈性工
作時間制度的實施，將可讓上班者有較多的充裕時間來妥善處理其於生活中所必須完成
的任務。同時，在彈性工作時間制度下，上班者將可在規定較寬鬆的時間範圍內選擇適
合自己生活節奏的上班時間，此將有助於紓緩制約條件對上班者一日活動排程的限制。 
本研究認為，「彈性工作時間制度」的導入將會對上班者之「生活時間評估」造成
影響，且亦會對上班者之「工作開始時間選擇」及「通勤出發時間選擇」造成影響。因
此隨著上班者「工作開始時間」的彈性化，「通勤出發時間」亦會隨之變動，此將有助
於消解尖峰時段的交通擁擠現象。此外，在時間的安排及運用方面，透過「彈性工作時
間制度」的導入，上班者將可更為有效地來安排一日行程，在「生活時間評估」的層面
上可獲得更大效用。是故，若能有效掌握此制度導入之效果，在未來或許將可對平日交
通問題提出較具效率的交通需求管理策略。 
 
二、研究目的 
實行彈性工作時間制度之主要目的，就是希望能將通勤時刻予以分散，以減緩尖峰
時刻之交通擁擠現象。而此制度的導入，在微觀的層面上，將會對上班者之交通行為造
成影響；同時，在宏觀的層面上，也會促使都會區內的交通需求產生變化（松井與藤田，
1993）。雖然目前已有部份相關的研究，但不論是在研究的量或質等方面仍舊有所不足
而待加強討論，故有必要再從新的觀點來對「彈性工作時間制度」的導入效果進行研究
與探討。 
本研究假設，隨著彈性工作時間制度的實施，上班者便會依據個人及其它家戶成員
 3
一同參加活動的效用」所組成。透過此模式，便可以瞭解「個人活動」與「家戶共同參
與活動」之間的背反效果。上述之研究雖可透過計量模式來瞭解「家戶成員需求」對個
人時間指派的影響，但是模式的假設卻成為此類研究的弱點。上述研究所採用的模式，
多半假設因果關係是直接的(即 X  (自變數)」會直接影響 2Y (依變數))。但在研究社會行
為時，情境是開放的，因此， X 與 2Y 的關係可能會受到「中介變數」之影響。是故，若
X 並非直接影響 2Y ，而是先影響 1Y 後，再對 2Y 造成影響( )1 2X Y Y→ → ，則上述模式將
無法有效分別觀察到變數間( )1 2;X Y X Y→ → 的影響關係。Lu & Pas(1999)則針對「社經
變數」、「活動參與(時間使用)」及「旅運行為」提出分析架構，該研究得到下列之研
究成果：c透過結構方程式的建構，可同時且有效地掌握存在於「社經變數」、「活動
參與(時間使用)」及「旅運行為」之間的複雜關係。d相較於僅以「社經變數」做為外
生變數所建構的旅運行為模式而言，該研究建構的結構方程式，更能有效且廣泛地解釋
「旅運行為」。e「參與家外活動」與「待在家中」的確存有關聯性。雖然，有學者批
評利用結構方程式進行分析，在學理上缺乏實際的行為理論配合(Saleh and Farrell, 
2005)，但其仍具備下列優點可供參考：c可透過相關研究之回顧，找出變數間的因果關
係，建立因果關係結構圖。d可將變數間的因果關係透過示意圖的方式呈現，可有助於
規劃者快速了解變數之間的關係，具有實務應用上的優點。e該方法融合了因子分析與
徑路分析，可說是一種呈現客觀狀態的數學模式。 
 
(三)上班者之通勤出發時間選擇之相關文獻 
既往關於上班者通勤出發時間選擇之研究，大多採用不連續選擇模式進行研究。其
以「時段」做為模式之替選方案，使上班者從中選取效用最大的時段做為其通勤出發時
間(Saleh & Farrell,2005)。然而，時間係屬於連續變數，當採用「不連續選擇模式」來處
理通勤出發時間選擇之決策時，將遭遇邏輯合理與否的問題。因此，如何以連續型模式
處理通勤出發時間選擇問題，便成為許多學者所努力研究之方向。而為了改善模式應用
上的問題，有許多學者開始採用生存時間模式來分析通勤出發時間選擇的問題(塚井
等，1999；Bhat and Steed，2002)。 
在所使用的變數方面，Small(1982)發現，「婚姻狀態」、「職業」、「使用的運具」
是對通勤出發時間選擇造成影響的主要因素。de Palma et al.(1997)在其研究中證實，與
採用固定上班時間制度的上班者相比較，採用彈性上班時間制度的上班者有較大的彈性
來選擇自己的出發時間。透過對既往研究成果之整理發現，對上班者之出發時間決策造
成影響的因素有：c旅行時間、d旅行成本、e婚姻狀態與家庭義務、f收入、5職業
及6工作時間彈性等。其中，又以上述6的影響最大。 
 
四、研究方法 
本研究係立足於微觀觀點，探討彈性上班時間制度的實施對上班者交通行為變化所
造成的影響，透過對上班者在該制度實施與否所產生行為變化之掌握，以利相關都市交
通管理策略之研擬。彈性上班時間制度（以下簡稱「制度」）的實施，將能有效紓緩通
勤時刻制約對個人活動的限制。在此制度下，每個上班者或上班者的家庭成員，便可依
 5
模式亦將納入「個人屬性」及「家戶屬性」等做為模式變數。個人屬性包括「年齡」、
「性別」、「若實施彈性工作時間制度，是否對執行公司業務感到不便」、「使用小汽
車做為通勤運具」等屬性變數；而家戶屬性則採用「家中是否有6歲以下之幼童」、「家
中是否有7~12歲的學童」、「家中是否有65歲以上的老人」等屬性變數。上述之個人屬
性及家戶屬性變數，均以虛擬變數之設定方式來納入模式中。 
本研究共建構7個不同「開始工作時間評估模式」，待模式建構完成(如表1)之後，
便能透過此模式，來掌握生活時間評估值與上班者家庭結構(家戶成員)之間的關係，亦
可藉此瞭解上班者對「期望的開始工作時間」之評估，及「家戶成員的交互影響效應」
所可能造成的影響。

(三) 上班者之通勤出發時間選擇模式 
上班者通勤出發時間的現況分佈比例如圖3所示，其所呈現的分佈型態係為「先遞
增，再遞減」的狀態。上班者通勤出發時間的尖峰集中在7:30-7:59時段，總計約有91%
的上班者選擇在上午9:00前出發。 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
圖 3  現況自宅出發時刻分佈圖 
既往關於「通勤出發時間選擇行為」之研究，多是利用「不連續選擇模式」來建構
通勤出發時間選擇行為的模式；本研究則是嘗試利用「連續型模式」來進行通勤出發時
間選擇行為模式的建構。由於上班者的「在宅(停留)時間」會受到「通勤出發時間選擇」
之影響而具有不確定性，故本研究假設，在平日中隨著時間的經過，從自宅出發的人之
比例會呈現連續的變化。因此，可採用生存時間模式（duration Model）做為描述通勤出
發時間選擇的模式，亦即，係利用生存函數來表現「停留於自宅內的時間(在此係以「通
勤出發時刻」減去「05:30」所得到的時間來表示，其單位為分鐘)」。在進行模式的參
數推估前，必須先假定生存函數的分佈形狀，由於上班者之在宅停留時間的機率分佈現
況和logistic分佈相近，故本研究決定使用「對數logistic分佈」做為生存函數的分佈形狀，

六、結論與建議 
本研究以ordered probit model、結構方程模式及hazard duration model來分析、探討
上班者的時間分配，並依序分別建構「工作開始時間評估模式」、「通勤出發時間選擇
之因果結構模式」及「通勤出發時間選擇模式」。透過本研究可得到以下的幾項結論： 
 
1.「個人屬性」及「家戶屬性」確實會對上班者之工作開始時間評估造成影響，特別是
在家戶屬性方面，「家中是否有6歲以下的幼童」及「家中是否有7~12歲的學童」，對
於上班者的時間安排則分別有不同情況的影響。 
2.透過「通勤出發時間選擇之因果結構模式」可發現以下的因果結構關係：(1)生活時間
評價→時刻選擇、(2)家戶屬性→時刻選擇、(3)家戶屬性→生活時間評價、(4)家戶屬性
→生活時間評價→時刻選擇。其中(1)~(3)表示出了潛在變數間的直接效果；而(4)則表
示出「家戶屬性」對「時刻選擇」的間接效果。 
3.透過「通勤出發時間選擇模式」可以發現，「上班前可利用時間」、「安全充裕時間」、
「遲到習性」、「使用機車做為通勤用具」、「家中7~12歲學童數」、「生活時間評
價」等6個變數對於上班者通勤出發時間選擇有顯著的影響。 
4.一般而言，當上班者的「上班前可利用時間」及「安全充裕時間」越多時，其會傾向
於較晚出門。此可能是因為，當「上班前可利用時間」及「安全充裕時間」越長時，
表示上班者於工作正式開始前(此處係設定為上午10:00)之可利用時間越長，如此一
來，將使其時間運用較具有彈性，可視狀況將「上班前可利用時間」與「安全充裕時
間」轉移至處理家務或其它活動。 
5.「遲到習性」在此亦為正向顯著影響變數，此亦顯示，平常就有遲到習性的人，通常
都會選擇較晚出門。 
6.「使用機車做為通勤運具」的上班者亦會傾向於較晚出門，此乃是因為機車本身的高
度機動性使然。機車體積小、速度快，且不易受到交通擁塞之影響，故使用機車的上
班者會傾向於較晚出門。 
7.在家庭組成狀況方面，當上班者家中有7~12歲學童時，大約在早上7點至7點30分前，
便必須配合家中7~12歲學童之就學時間，載送學童到校，故選擇較晚離家上班。 
8.「生活時間評價」係指「受訪者對己身之生活時間分配的評價」，其係數亦為正向顯

A study on the relationship between tenure choice and dwelling type choice 
  --Tainan City 
Authors: Kan-Chung Huang, Kuang-Yih Yeh, Hao-Ching Hsia 
 
ABSTRACT 
Tenure choice and dwelling type choice are two important parts in decision process of housing 
demand, and both of them are probably connected. Most of studies focused on tenure choice and 
ignored the relationship between it and dwelling type. The other few studies still can’t completely 
explain decision process and meaning of housing demand of households due to inadequate and 
restricted model. This study uses the data obtained from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey 
to conduct statistics and analysis on the tenure and dwelling types of the households in Tainan City, 
aiming to preliminarily understand the relations between tenure and relevant effect variables, the 
relations between dwelling type and relevant effect variables and the relations between tenure and 
dwelling type. In addition, the study tries to express the possibility of the nest structure for tenure 
and dwelling type with icons and discusses the effect and setting method of the factors that possibly 
affect the above two, thus laying a theoretical foundation for follow-up empirical studies.  
Keywords：Tenure Choice, Dwelling Type Choice, Process of Decision 
 
1. Introduction  
In early period, most of the studies on housing demand explored the behaviors of housing 
consumers based on hedonic price function, for example: Rosen, (1974), Linneman (1980), Butler 
(1982) and Megbolugbe (1991). Hedonic price function implies housing price varies with housing 
attribute and isn’t affected by household income and preference. Later on, scholars strongly 
questioned this concept and put forth models which cover household income, preference and 
characteristics. The most popular one is the model of logit form, while the pioneer is Quigley 
(1976). Quigley (1976) established a joint choice model of residential location and dwelling type in 
Pittsburgh. The followers, such as: Lerman(1977) and Anas (1982) devoted attention to the 
establishment of the joint choice model of travel or commute mode and residential location. In the 
same period, researchers on housing demand made diverse attempts. For instance, Borsch-Supan 
and Pitkin (1998) concentrated on the choice between nine housing alternatives and explored the 
role of demographic and financial variables. Fischer and Aufhauser (1988) integrated several 
elements of the institutionalised and regulated the nature of housing market in an analysis of the 
relationship between household type and housing choice. The study revealed the significant impacts 
of demographic and income-based variables on housing choice. Kim (1992) focused on the 
estimation of the choice behavior of dwelling units in the rental housing market. The results of the 
study show that transitory or permanent income, family size and level of education have strong 
effects on the Korean rental housing choice.

The past empirical studies in relation to tenure choice mostly established models with logistic 
regression, while model calibration still adopted a method of defining an alternative as reference 
alternative and the rest as optional alternatives. The odds ratio of the average or dummy variables of 
household attribute to the tenure-related alternative is used to evaluate the effect of economic 
variables and variables of household attribute on the choice of tenure-related alternative. This study 
uses the concept of average value, but ignores the discrepancy of individual utilities. Therefore, if 
economic utility theory is used as analysis basis, its reasonableness will be obviously inferior to 
discrete choice model. In addition, when making tenure choice, households will give simultaneous 
consideration to dwelling type, thus forming a joint choice model of tenure and dwelling type (refer 
to detached dwelling or multiple dwelling). To ascertain whether tenure and dwelling type have the 
relation of simultaneous choice or nest choice, or whether they are mutually independent, the 
multinomial logit model and nested logit model in discrete choice model must be compared.  
The scope of this study is Tainan City. Firstly, the study makes preliminary analysis on demographic 
statistic attribute, income and expenditure of households, tenure and dwelling type in Tainan City 
by using the data obtained from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Secondly, it 
discusses the contingency analysis of tenure, dwelling type and relevant variables. Lastly, it tries to 
preliminarily establish a joint choice model of tenure and dwelling type. 
 
2. Study objects and scope 
This study uses the data obtained from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey 2003 in Taiwan 
and households in Tainan City are selected as study objects. The Family Income and Expenditure 
Survey adopt stratified two-section random sampling. Counties and cities are sub-matrices, villages 
are first-section sampling units and the households in villages are second-section sampling units. 
0.2% of the total households in Taiwan were sampled as sample households and amount to about 
14,000. This survey program includes: 1. family composition; 2. overview of family equipment and 
dwellings; 3. income and expenditure; 4. consumption expenditure; 5. capital gain and loss as well 
as transferred income and expenditure. Field investigation was carried out in the second year of the 
survey. The survey on family income and expenditure provides information about households’ 
income and expenditure, population attribute and lifecycle, tenure and dwelling type. Fig. 1 is the 
administrative map of Tainan City. The city has 175.6456km2 of land and 756,859 of population, 
lies in the southwestern corner of Taiwan and is the fourth largest city in Taiwan.

In terms of marital status of household heads, the married household heads account for 71.85%, 
followed by the unmarried, accounting for 14.57%. The household heads with other marital statuses 
account for 13.58%. The sample distribution is shown in Table 3.

(3) Contingency analysis of household housing tenure, housing type and household attribute 
Housing tenure is classified into: owner-occupied, rent, issued and others (including borrowed). 
This study only takes owner-occupied and rent into consideration. Therefore, 40 samples for 
“issued” and “other (including borrowed)” are deleted. Besides, in the classification of household 
head’s occupations, in order to enhance the effectiveness of relevant follow-up verification, 
occupations with little sample data are ignored, including 7 samples: farm, livestock and relevant 
laborers, forestry and relevant laborers, fishery and relevant laborers, in-service armymen and so on. 
In addition, technicians and assistant professional staff, affair staff, service staff and salespersons, 
technical workers and relevant staff, machine operators, assembly workers, non-technical workers 
and manual laborers are jointly called technicians and affair staff. People’s representatives, chief 
executives, corporate chief and managers are jointly called “chiefs”.  
First of all, the relationship between tenure and dwelling type were discussed. From the discussion, 
Table 7 was obtained. From Table 7, it can be seen that in Tainan City, most houses are 
owner-occupied, accounting for 89.7%. Detached dwelling are dominant, accounting for 87.1%. For 
the lower land price than other big cities and the desire to own independent asset especially for 
southern Taiwaness, It comes out the not surprised result. Besides, the Chi-Square Test on tenure 
and dwelling type accepts null hypothesis, i.e. tenure and dwelling type are irrelevant.

From Table 11, it can be seen that regardless of educational level, detached dwelling are dominant. 
The lower the educational level is, the higher the ratio of detached dwelling among household heads 
is Nevertheless, the Chi-Square Test accepts H0 null hypothesis, i.e. dwelling type and educational 
level are irrelevant.

From Table 12, it can be seen that regardless of marital status, the ratio of detached dwelling is 
higher than that of multiple dwelling. The ratio of detached dwelling among married household 
heads is higher than that among household heads with other marital statuses. The Chi-Square Test 
accepts H0 null hypothesis, i.e. dwelling type and marital status are irrelevant.   
 
In addition, the analysis of tenure and relevant variables are shown in Table 13. From Table 13, it 
can be seen that the income of households which rental or owner-occupied dwellings varies 
obviously with the number of school-age children. T-test reveal that the mean and standard 
deviation income of owner-occupied household are both higher than renters, while the former

Subsequently, the setting method and the types of relercne variables which the tenure choice 
alternatives involve are expressed in Table 14.

financial loan from public sector 
Alternative-specific 
dummy variable 
 
The effect and degree of the above variables on tenure choice are explained below separately:  
 
(1) Income 
Income increase will raise the probability of owner-occupied housing. Most studies believe the 
consumption of durable goods depends on permanent income, while permanent income is the 
accumulation of current income over a period of time, so it won’t be as changeable as current 
income which is affected by many temporary elements. So, permanent income has a better 
demonstration effect than current income does. Generally speaking, current income will 
underestimate the elasticity of housing demand (Mayo, 1981). However, it is difficult to know 
permanent income. Moreover, for same housing market, reasonable elasticity of housing demand 
can also be obtained through estimation with current income. The estimated value of permanent 
income and that of current income should be an issue of “relatively accurate”. After counting the 
cost, this article adopts current income as explanatory variable.  
(2) Value-rent ratio 
Value-rent ratio can be used as an alternative variable for the possibility of household investment 
and consumption mix. The principle is to compare the subject house with other houses to reveal the

The preliminary study of effects of flexible time system on commuting time 
choice and scheduling evaluation :  
Study on Commuting Departure Time Choice and Expected Work-Starting Time of 
Commuters 
Kuang-Yih Yeh1     Hao-Ching Hsia2    Kan-Chung Huang3 
 
abstract 
To meet their own demands on the food, clothing, shelter, travel, sports and 
recreation, people must exchange their labor for rewards, and then get the desired goods 
and/or services from markets with such rewards. Therefore, for most of people who have 
to earn their household livelihood, work has become the most important activity on the 
weekdays. If the work starting time is fixed, the commuting trips will be concentrated 
during peak hours, resulting in traffic congestion. Congestion will result in traffic accidents, 
air pollution, noise, and higher travel cost (time) and will make workers’ quality of life worse. 
As the flexible working time system is executed, commuters are able to determine the 
most optimal commuting departure time and the expected work-starting time according to 
the allocation frame of living times ( spaces of living )of individuals and other household 
members. Therefore, before the introduction of the flexible working time system, to 
examine the possible influences choices for commuting departure time and work-starting 
time which are resulted from the social and economic backgrounds of commuters and 
other constraints allows for the establishment of such a flexible working time system that 
satisfies the need of commuters. This is the major purpose of this study.

a brief description is made about the execution methods and procedures of this study, and 
preliminary results are presented. In the last Section, some conclusions and 
recommendations are made.  
 
2. Literature Review 
2.1 Some studies related to commuting departure time choice 
In the past, the majority of studies regarding the commuting departure time choice of 
commuters were conducted using the discrete choice model, which uses time-period as 
the alternative of patterns, allowing commuters to choose the most efficient time-periods 
as their commuting departure times. Cosslett, Abkowitz and Small et al. all used the 
multinomial logit model to construct the model of commuting departure time choice (Saleh 
& Farrell, 2005). Some scholars believed that there could be a sequential decision 
relationship between the commuting departure time choice and the commuting mode 
choice. Bhat (1998) constructed the combined choice model of departure time choice and 
the commuting mode choice through taking shopping trips as examples, and he believed 
that there was a nested relationship(sequential relationship)between the departure time 
choice and commuting mode choice, that is, the commuting mode choice was at upper 
nested level (decided first), while the departure time choice at lower one(decided later). 
Meanwhile, there were some scholars who believed that the relationship between the 
commuting departure time choice and route choice was sequential decision one too 
(Chang et al., 2003; Ziliaskopoulos & Rao, 1999). In the foresaid combined choice model, 
although the nested structural relationship between the commuting departure time choice 
and the commuting mode choice (or route choice) had been demonstrated through 
statistical verification, but the rationality of this relationship merely stopped at the one of 
logistic reasoning. Considering the actual actions of commuters on weekdays, the 
commuting mode and route used by them for commuting characterize steady and not easy 
to change, in another words, the commuters are not always making choices for the 
traffic/route due to the habit behavior formed from long-term influences proposed by 
individual habits, household properties and other factors. In addition, the difference in the 
commuting mode will be reflected out by length of trip hours that will affect the commuting 
departure time choice behavior of commuters. So, in this study, the used commuting mode 
is considered as an exogenous variable which affects the commuting departure time 
choice. It is found from the results of various studies that the contributing factors affecting 
the decision of departure time by commuters include: ctrip hours, dtrip cost, emarital 
status and household liabilities, fincome, goccupation and hflexibility of working time. 
Among them, the sixth factor has the greatest influence. Small (1982) observed that marital status,

model. Wen & Koppelman(1999) also used the nested logit model to analyze issues concerning the 
stopping location choice and tour formation choice of households . The studies foresaid more often 
than not focused on the analysis of activity-travel behavior, seldom involving the group decision of 
household members. The Albatross model system established by Arentze & Timmermans(2000) 
belongs to a heuristic simulation system. It assumes that the choice behavior of individuals belongs 
to a continuous decision behavior, based on different rules. Through interaction with environment 
and communication with other persons, individuals can acquire experiences and correct the 
existing rules with the acquired experiences, and form different decision behaviors. With this 
model, we can forecast what types of activities the individuals is going to do, when, where, with 
whom and what commuting mode will be used. This model analyzes the activity-travel behavior 
from multiple aspects, but it does not consider the group decision. Gliebe & Koppelman(2000) 
used the additive household utility function of household members to model the interactions 
among household members. In this model, it is assumed that the effectiveness of a household 
member is related to the effectiveness of the remaining household members and the effectiveness 
of his/her participation in activities with other household members. Then through this model, the 
contradiction effects of individual activities against the activities jointly participated by other 
household members . It can be concluded according to previous studies that the interactive effect 
between individual demands and the demands of other household members really impacts on the 
allocation of commuters’ living times. Therefore, during the modeling of work starting time 
evaluation, it is necessary to take both types of variables into consideration.  
 
3. Survey summary and Methods 
This study mainly covers: cmodeling of commuting departure time choice. This study 
has also tried to model the commuting departure time choice behavior using continuous 
model (This study actually uses the hazard based duration model) to find out the factors 
affecting commuters to determine their commuting departure times; dmodeling of work 
starting time evaluation. In this Section, the ordered probit model is adopted to analyze 
and construct the living time evaluation model so that the influences of individual 
properties and household properties of commuters on work starting time evaluation. 
In aspect of information collection, this study takes commuters in Tainan City as the 
study respondents. A questionnaire investigation was conducted with 50 commuters 
randomly sampled from office buildings over all Tainan City. Both consequential analysis 
and construction of related models are performed based on these 50 commuter samples.  
 
3.1 Survey Summary 
For the sake of easy accessibility of information, this study chose only six districts of 
 25
their working places before the required work-starting time and use this time-period to 
make preparations for work starting.

3.2 Modeling and Analysis of Commuting Departure Time Choice  
Table 1 shows the present status of commuting departure time distribution of 
commuters; the distribution profile appears a right skewness, that is, 18% of the 
respondents are free-time workers or other special workers, so they can depart home after 
10:00am. But, regarding it as a whole, the peak of commuting departure time fall within the 
time-period from 7:00am to 7:59am; that is, up to 82% commuters choose to depart home 
before 9:00am.

Child 
It represents the household structure. 
(It takes a value of 1 if there is al least one child who is younger than 12 
years old in respondent’s household , and 0 otherwise.) 
It should be noted that it can not be involved in the model with Child1 
and Child2 simultaneously. 
 
Duty 
It represents that an individual’s duty of taking household member to 
school or workplace. 
(It takes a value of 1 if a respondent has a duty, and 0 otherwise.) 
 
In the commuting departure time choice model constructed by this study, the in-home 
time-period from the wake-up time to the departure time of commuters is considered as 
the dependent variable of this model. Therefore, this model can be considered as the 
model of the in-home dwell time prior to the departure for work. This study has tried many 
times to model using the different combinations of variables. And during modeling, the 
existing assumptions are followed. In the four types of assumptions, different variables are 
singled out for modeling. After experiments of many times, it is found that the commuting 
habit exerts no significant impacts on the commuting departure time choice of commuters. 
So this variable is not taken into consideration during modeling. 
From Table 3, it can be seen that the following variables: ample safety time(Safety 
time), use of Scooters(Scooter) and necessity of carting household members to 
work/school(Duty) greatly influence commuters’ decision of commuting departure time 
choice. The ample safety time is equal to the core work-starting time minus the 
working-place arrival time. The more ample safety time commuters have, the later they 
always tend to depart from home. This is because that this time-period can be allotted and 
employed freely by commuters and may be transferred for handling household works or 
their own affairs before they depart from home. For the purpose of this study, making 
references to previous studies, the core work-starting time is taken as 10:00am.  
Scooters characterize small size and not prone to influence of traffic congestion. 
Commuters who use scooters as their commuting mode have high mobility. They not only 
need no time to look for parking spaces, but also have higher certainty in commuting time 
control than cars or public traffic users certainty, especially during peak time-periods. So, 
commuters using Scooters as commuting mode will spend more in-home time and tend to 
leave home late.

For the purpose of work-starting time evaluation, a five-point Likert scale is used, and 
the respondents are asked to give their evaluation to each time-period as divided 
hereinafter through choosing one value from values -2, -1, 0, 1 and 2, indicating that the 
work-starting time within this time-period is very inappropriate, inappropriate, no problem, 
appropriate and very appropriate to them respectively. Table 5 shows the weighted 
average evaluation value of each time period.  
As shown in Table 5, the work-starting time within time-period from 8:00am to 8:59am 
is also estimated by commuters appropriate; the overall evaluation curve appears a 
single-peak shape, going up as the advance of time first, and then gradually dropping from 
some time point. This can be verified with data shown in Table 6. It can be observed from 
Table 6 that the single-peak shaped work starting time evaluation shares the highest 
proportion, about 74%.Therefore, it is very clear that in the mind of each commuter, there 
is an optimal work-starting time which he/she is satisfied with.  
In the course of investigation of work-starting time evaluation, only normal working 
hours is involved, no consideration given to the influences of overtimes. Meanwhile, only 
pre-work and post-work activities are taken into consideration. In this way, the 
requirements of evaluation basis are met. In addition, even if the flexible working hour 
system is introduced, but the working hours per day are still constant. This means that, 
while commuters have decided their work-starting time, they have also decided their 
work-closing time. Taking one hour as the time division unit, this study divides morning 
hours (6:00~12:00) into six time-periods: 6:00~6:59, 7:00~7:59, 8:00~8:59, 9:00~9:59, 
10:00~10:59 and11:00~12:00. In the questionnaire, the respondents were asked about 
what time-period they most expect their work-starting time to fall within; and to give their 
evaluation on the degree of appropriateness of each “expected work-starting time” on a 
Likert scale that ranged from “very inappropriate” to “very appropriate”. In this study, the 
assumption that all respondents make their evaluation on each time-period on the same 
evaluation basis is employed. According to the evaluation given by each respondent, the 
optimal work-starting time satisfying his/her pace of living can be determined quickly and 
decidedly. To learn precisely the effect of interactive interferences between household 
members, both individual properties and household properties are incorporated into the 
model as variables. Individual properties include such variables as age, gender and so on; 
the variables of household properties include the numbers of children under age 6 and age 
 31
identical. Such assumption is inconsistent with the basic assumptions of “order” variable 
(the values of order variable merely indicate difference in degree, while the difference in 
order is meaningless). Thus, the regression model does not suit to address such problem. 
Therefore, to consider the fact that dependent variable is a question in the questionnaire 
which is used to measure the order (1 = very bad, 5= very good) and for the sake of ease 
to analysis, the ordered probit model is employed.  
The ordered probit model was first proposed by Zavoina and McKelvey in 1975 based 
on binary probit model. Because this order choice model can be used to study preference 
order problems, in recent years it has found wide applications in a variety of research 
fields, such as public policy-making, commuters’ attitudes towards travel demands 
management strategy (Bhattacharjee et al., 1997; Abdel-Aty, 2001; Podgorski and 
Kockelman, 2006). Refer to Maddala(1989) for the detailed modeling of this model.  
In this study, the degree of acceptance toward time-periods is classified into five rates 
(answer options): very unacceptable, unacceptable, no problem, acceptable, very 
acceptable, and expressed by 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The threshold parameters are denoted by 
1−µ , 0µ , 1µ , 2µ , 3µ , 4µ , where, 1−µ = −∞ , 0 0µ = , 4µ = ∞ . If all five options of 
acceptance are used, then only three threshold parameters are required. The major 
significance of threshold parameters lies in determining the relative value of each 
acceptance rate. To find out the variables affecting each time-period evaluation model, 
t-statistics shall be used for judgment. This study has addressed work-starting time 
evaluation models, whose results are listed in Table 7.  
It is clear from Table 7 that, in the aspect of age, the commuters over age21 and 
under age 40 set a high value on the work-starting time-period after 8:00am; whereas the 
commuters age 41 to 50 prefer to the work-starting times within time-period from 7:00am 
to 7:59. In terms of gender, male commuters have high regard for the work-starting times 
within time-periods from 7:00am to 7:59am and from 8:00am to 8:59am.  
In point of the effect of interactive interference between household members, the 
number of children under age 6 and the number of school children aged 7 ~ 12 bring 
distinguishable impacts on the evaluation on work starting time the commuters 
respectively. The more children under age 6 there are in a household, the higher value the 
household attach on the work-starting time within the time-period from 7:00 am to 7:59am. 
This result seems irrational, but in reality, amongst commuters with children under age 6, 
the greater part of them are very young and at low occupational positions. Therefore, even 
if the flexible working time system has been introduced in the firms that they are serving, 
they have to arrive at the working places earlier than their superiors do. Under such 
circumstances, the only choice to these commuters is to cart the children to the nurseries

(1) The mean wake-up time of commuters is at 7:28am, the average commuting departure 
time at 8:23am; the average work arrival time at 8:43am. In average, after getting up, 
commuters spend about one hour to handle household works or individual activities; 
after departure from home, commuters averagely spend approximate 20minutes in 
traveling to their working places. Overall, most commuters have arrived at their working 
places by 9:00am.  
(2) In the commuting departure time choice model, it is clear that such variables as the 
ample safety time, the use of Scooters as commute mode, and carting household 
members to work/school significantly affect commuters’ decision of commuting 
departure time.  
(3) Generally, if commuters have more ample safety time, they tend to leave home late. It 
is because that the longer the ample safety time is, the more time commuters will have 
available before work starting time(assumed as 10:00am). In this way, their time use 
patterns will become flexible, and they may transfer part of the ample safety time to 
household works or other activities.  
(4) Commuters who use Scooters as commuting modes also tend to depart home late. It is
