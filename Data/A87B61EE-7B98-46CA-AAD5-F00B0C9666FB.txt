Study on Lagrange multiplier optimization synthesis of complicated 
fiber gratings 
英文摘要 
  
Lagrange multiplier optimization (LMO) is an optimal algorithm using variation 
method and functional analysis to search optimal solutions for a given object function 
(target) and to control and constrain several designed parameters for the problem to 
be solved, while meeting a set of preset constrains. In many published papers, LMO 
has been successfully utilized for solving many optimal problems in mathematics 
fields. In recent years, linear and nonlinear fiber gratings have played important roles 
in many advanced applications. However, before these advanced grating devices can 
ultimately find vast applications and actually provide technical improvements or 
economical benefits, the drawbacks of the existing methods for inverse design of 
fiber grating should be improved. Because of this, the development of new 
algorithms for fiber grating synthesis as well as advanced new techniques for 
practical implementation of the designed fiber gratings with optimal performances 
are very important. Therefore, the investigations involved in this project will include 
the study of novel LMO algorithm for designing more complicated fiber based 
devices for fiber communications and sensing systems: EDFA gain flattening LPG 
filter, linear LPG or triangular LPG filters for sensing systems, the reconstruction of 
measured reflectivity or transmission coefficient of FBG, multiobjective problems for 
narrowband dispersionless fiber Bragg grating, second-order and third-order 
dispersion compensators and multichannel dispersionless fiber Bragg gratings or 
high-order multichannel dispersion compensators.

constrained parameter of phase term. The main aim of the present work is to fully carry out the 
theoretical framework and to demonstrate the suitability and advantages of this method for advanced 
FBG filter design problems. In the study, complete mathematical theory for multi-target optimal FBGs 
can be obtained with the additional advantage of reducing the index modulation. The convergence rate 
is very fast and direct for the LMCO algorithms [18-19] when compared to the stochastic approaches. 
We believe this is the first demonstration that the designed results of dispersionless FBGs from the 
LMCO multi-target optimization approach indeed can achieve user-defined performance. Moreover, 
an extension of the proposed LMO optimization method is to synthesize transmission type gratings, in 
such a way that another branch of fiber grating-based devices such as LPGs can also be synthesized 
by the method. In synthesis of the transmission type gratings, a linear LPG and an EDFA gain 
flattening LPG filters are successfully synthesized and analyzed by using the method. The designed 
results also prove that the presented algorithm is an effective method both for reflection-type and 
transmission-type fiber grating devices.

the designed coupling coefficient distribution function with ∆n(z) being the envelope function of the

Where )( 1−mmδ is wavelength detuning parameter and )(43.0 1−= mmcδ which corresponding to a 
bandwidth of full width at half maximum (-3dB bandwidth) of the filter is about 0.2nm and -0.5dB 
bandwidth about 0.165nm , 0r  is the maximum reflectivity set 0.99. The central wavelength was 
always 1550nm. In the proposed algorithm for synthesized NBDL-FBG, the units of λ and L  are 
mm , and κ(z) is 1−mm . α, β and η are ad hoc constants which act different roles in different designed 
cases. Parameter α is mainly concerned the evolution of the coupling coefficient,η is a weighting 
parameter of phase term which is nonzero for dispersionless FBG and zero for usual FBG which only 
reflectivity spectrum is considered, and β is a constrained parameter for coupling coefficient of the 
designed fiber grating which is zero for unconstrained conditions and nonzero for the constrained 
coupling coefficient design The constrain on the value of the coupling constant can be more enforced 
with the sacrifice of the reflectivity spectrum quality by increasing the values of the weighting 
parameter β. In this study case, we find that the best value of α is around 5101× and η is about 0.5, 
which can achieve an optimal and smoother convergence for the designed NBDL-FBG filters.

using the proposed LMCO approach to solve the inverse design problems of FBGs have been 
identified. These advantages include the possibility to constrain the patterns of the coupling 
coefficient profiles, to constrain the fiber grating length, and to obtain better solutions through 
skillfully arranged the weighting parameters in cost functional. These features certainly may have 
great merits in designing practical fiber grating devices with special requirements.  
 
d Synthesis of Long-Period Fiber Gratings (LPGs) with a Lagrange Multiplier Optimization 
(LMO) Method 
For the synthesis of LPG with the LMO method, when only the coupling between two modes (core 
mode and one cladding mode) in the LPG is considered, the coupled mode equations can be written as

]/2)[2/1( Λ−−= πββδ clco = )/1/1( Deffn λλπ −Δ  is the detuning parameter for LPG, Λ  is the grating

the designed coupling coefficient function with )(znΔ  being the envelope function of the grating 
index modulation and η  the overlapping factor.  
The main idea of the LMO algorithm to synthesize LPGs is to find the complex spatially coupling 
coefficient, )(zκ , of the grating with that the corresponding transmission spectrum, )(λcoT , can meet 
a given target spectrum, )(λdT . Therefore, the objective functional needed to be minimized can be 
defined by the users, such as,  
( )[ ] ( )[ ]∫ ∫∞∞− +−=Φ Ldco dzzdTT 0 22 2)(21 κβλλλ ,                                          (2) 
where ( ) ( ) ( ) 20/ cococo ALAT =λ is the calculated transmission spectrum of output core mode for LPG,

where )()( λλ dcot TT −=Δ  is the discrepancy between the output and target transmission spectra. 
Again, we use the variation method on the cost functional J  with respect to the real and imaginary 
parts of the coupling coefficient function Rκ  and Iκ , respectively, i.e. 
( ) ( )∫∫ ∞∞−−∞∞ ⋅−⋅+⋅−⋅+⋅= λμμλμμκβδκδ dAAdAAJ coRclIcoIcoRclRcoIclIcoRRR   ,             (6a)

With an initial guess for the coupling coefficient profile, )()()( zizz IR κκκ += , the equations of 
motion for the multipliers are solved with the help of Eq. (4) and the corresponding boundary 
conditions in Eq. (5). The optimization of the LMO method progressed until the convergence 
requirement was satisfied through following iteration procedure:

where Rα  and Iα  are ad hoc constants for real and imaginary parts of the coupling coefficient, 
respectively. The new coupling coefficient can be expressed as follows ''' )()( IR izz κκκ += . The 
algorithm we use to implement the LMO methods for designing of LPGs can be summarized with 
following steps, 
(a) Guess an initial coupling coefficient function Rκ (only real part is given for simplifying the 
algorithm).  
(b) Calculate the core and cladding modes, )(zAco  and )(zAcl , with Eq. (1) from 0=z  to Lz =  
with the given initial conditions, 1)0( =coA , 0)0( =clA and obtain all values of )(zAco , )(zAcl  
from 0=z  to Lz = . 
(c) If the )(LAco , )(LAcl  are calculated and known, then the boundary condition at Lz =  for the 
Lagrange-multipliers, coμ  and clμ , in Eq. (5) are known as well. 
(d) Compute the propagation of the Lagrange-multiplier functions in Eq. (4) from Lz =  to 0=z  
with the boundary conditions in Eq. (5).

and 2(c), we can clearly see that an appropriate maximum value of the initial index modulation helps 
to find a better synthesized result more efficiently. For a larger value of the maximum index 
modulation, the convergence curve of the average error declines quickly at the first state but oscillates 
in the long run, as shown in Fig. 2(d).

Another example to demonstrate by LMO method is the well known EDFA gain flattening LPG 
(EDFA-GFLPG). In previous work, various design schemes of LPG devices have been proposed to 
equalize the gain spectrum of an EDFA. The main approaches are based on the phase shift LPGs, using 
multiple LPGs scraped together or specially arranged LPGs to match the spectral shaping to flatten 
EDFA gain spectrum. However, in this work, we directly synthesize the EDFA-GFLPGs just by using a

the initial guess index modulation profile, (b) the real and imaginary parts, and (c) the amplitude and phase 
of the final index modulation profiles. 
Finally, the last but not least thing, we want to emphasize is that all of the synthesized LPG filters 
demonstrated here are calculated with the constrained parameter β  shown in Eq. (2) set to be zero 
(no constrain condition). The parameter β acts like an alternate and constrained parameter in the 
objective function to constrain the profile of the coupling coefficient: κ(z). It can be set zero for the 
unconstrained coupling coefficient of the design condition and only the discrepancy between the 
output and target transmission spectra of LPGs is considered (the first term of Eq. (2)), moreover, 
based on our previous publication for reflection-type FBGs, non-zero β for further decrease the 
maximum value of the index modulation by sacrificing the reflectivity of the FBGs (i.e. increasing the 
reflectivity error) is the designed case that the κ(z) always kept real number in FBGs. However, in this 
present work of optimal LPGs by the LMO method, the phase of the κ(z) (complex) was introduced to

摘要 
A novel and simple in-line fiber polarizer is presented. The proposed device 
is fabricated by tapering an anisotropic flat-cladding birefringent micro-fiber 
surrounding with low-dispersion optical-liquid cladding. We also presented a 
theoretical analysis for dispersive birefringence of flat-clad micro-fiber with 
liquid overlay. The proposed device can be useful as all-fiber polarizer for 
optical communications. Simulation results show the birefringence of the 
device can be enhanced when the aspect is larger. In the experimental 
measurement for polarization extinction ratio (PER) of the proposed device, a 
fiber-pigtailed 1549.25 nm DFB laser light was used as light source. The PER 
about 30 dB was demonstrated when the liquid with refractive index nD = 
1.45 was used.
