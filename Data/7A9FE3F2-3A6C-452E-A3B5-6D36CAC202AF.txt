研究摘要： 
 
Based on the basis of the effects of cartilage matrix for chondrogenic induction, we 
hypothesize that using type II collagen scaffold, hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate might 
mimic cartilage matrix and provide the necessary information for MSC chondrogenesis.  
In this proposed project, the fetal Wharton’s jelly cells (WJCs) will be chosen for further 
in-vitro chondrogenic studies due to their native advantages and the facilities of obtainment from 
cell banks. Moreover, we attempt to optimize a more favor condition by using type II collagen, 
chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid to help chondrogenic induction of mesenchymal stem cells.  
We investigated the effects of using collagen-CS-HA gel for chodrogenesis of WJCs in an 
in-vitro study. After 2 or 4 weeks of in-vitro culture, H&E staining of the constructs did not show 
round and elongated chondrocyte-like appearances and neo-cartilage regions. The WJCs in 
Collagen-CS-HA gel were condensed and appeared like cells in the pellet culture. The cells 
displayed negative staining for Alcian blue in the collagen I-CS-HA gel or collagen II/I-CS-HA gel 
groups after 2 weeks of in-vitro culture. After 4 weeks, the cells in the Collagen I-CS-HA gel 
showed only light Alcian blue staining. This implied the WJ-MSCs in the collagen-CS-HA gels did 
not differentiate into a chodrogenic lineage. The DNA contents of the constructs in the collagen 
I-CS-HA gel or collagen II/I-CS-HA gel showed a reduced trend in this study. This implied that cell 
death or cell loss had been happened during in-vitro culture. GAGs form an important component of 
cartilage tissue and were secreted by chondrocytes. Our data showed that GAGs content increased 
over a 4-week culture. This implied that the collage-CS-HA gel could promote the GAGs 
production, especially the collagen II/I-CS-HA gel. However, the results of real-time qPCR showed 
that the cells in collagen-CS-HA gels failed to express the gene expression of type II collagen. This 
revealed that the WJCs did not differentiate into chondrocytes and did not product the normal ECM 
of cartilage tissue. Therefore, using collagen-CS-HA gels could not successfully promote the 
chondrogenesis of WJCs. 
In conclusion, using collagen-CS-HA gels of this study could not successfully promote the 
chondrogenesis of WJCs. In the further, we should find out the better strategy to optimize the 
chodrogenic differentiation for WJCs.

In this study, we developed a type II collagen-chondroitin sulfate-hyalruonic acid scaffold and 
embedded WJCs into the scaffold for chondrogenesis. In brief, trypsinized cells were embedded in 
Collagen II/I-CS-HA gel (total collagen: chondroitin sulfate sodium: sodium hyaluronate = 0.24% : 
0.1% : 0.001%). The cells were dispersed in the 8 volumes of collagen II/I solution containing equal 
volume of 3 mg/ml type I collagen (SumMax) and 3 mg/ml type II collagen (SIGMA). Then, the 
cell-collagen mixture were added to 1 volume of 0.05 N NaOH (SIGMA), 2.2% NaHCO3 
(SIGMA), and 200 mM HEPES (SIGMA) and 1 volume of DMEM–LG (GIBCO) concentrated 
10-fold including of CS (Chondroitin Sulfate Sodium; SIGMA) and HA (Sodium Hyaluronate; 
ARTZDispo) with gentle agitation. Finally, cells were embedded into the Collagen-CS-HA mixture 
and 0.5 ml aliquots were allowed to gelatinize in 24-well plates at 37°C for 1 hour (final cell 
numbers = 5x10
6
 cells/construct). 
 
可利用之產業及可開發之產品： 
 
The Collagen II/I-CS-HA scaffold developed in this study could be a product in cartilage tissue 
engineering. However, using collagen-CS-HA gels of this study could not successfully promote the 
chondrogenesis of WJCs. In the further, we should find out the better strategy to optimize the 
chodrogenic differentiation for WJCs. 
 
推廣及運用的價值： 
 
This preliminary results obtained from this study could provide some information for related 
studies, and suggested that only collagen-CS-HA materials could not be enough for chondrogenesis 
of WJCs.
