一、Introduction (計畫的緣由與目的) 
 In recent years, polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors (poly-Si TFTs) have attracted 
much attention because of their wide range applications in active matrix liquid crystal displays 
(AMLCDs) [1], and active matrix organic light-emitting displays (AMOLEDs) [2]. The major 
attraction of the poly-Si TFTs in AMLCDs lies in their greatly improved carrier mobility in the 
poly-Si film, the ability to integrate pixel switching elements, and the ability to integrate panel 
array, peripheral driving circuits and functional components on a single glass substrate. Such 
poly-Si TFT is thus ushering in the era of system-on-panel (SOP) technology [3][4]. Additionally, 
for data storage, high-density nonvolatile memory (NVM) is a necessary component for the 
realization of SOP. On the other hand, in crystalline Si wafer-based technology, a nonvolatile 
flash memory is very popular for portable electronics, and the demand for memory density 
multiplies every year. Although flash memory is aggressively scaled for high-density applications, 
continuing to scale according to Moore’s law is becoming increasingly difficult because of both 
process and device limitations. This three-dimensional (3D) multi-layer-stack memory that is 
based on poly-Si TFTs can be used as ultra-high-density memory [5]-[8]. 
In CMOS technology, tri-gate structure has been reported to exhibit superior gate control 
over the channel than a conventional single-gate MOSFET [9]. Several superior characteristics of 
nanowires (NWs) poly-Si TFTs have been demonstrated. The NWs TFTs exhibit low leakage 
current in the off state, a high ON/OFF current ratio, a low subthreshold slope, an absence of 
DIBL (Drain Induced Barrier Lowering), and favorable output characteristics [10]. Additionally, 
the NWs structure is suitable for nonvolatile applications. Especially, the program/erase (P/E) 
efficiency of the tri-gate and the Pi-gate NWs poly-Si TFTs for nonvolatile memory applications 
is outstanding [11], [12].  
 A simple EEPEROM that uses twin poly-Si TFTs has been proposed to realize the above 
applications. Based on our work, a poly-Si TFT that utilizes nanowires offers a significant 
performance improvement. In this study, a novel twin poly-Si TFTs EEPROM with a tri-gate 
nanowires structure is further fabricated. The effects of device dimensions, performance and

two-bit poly-Si NVM structure with SiO2/Si3N4/SiO2 stacked layer. The electron storage regions and reverse read 
are indicated by arrows, and referred to as bit-S and bit-D. 
 
The devices were fabricated on 6-inch silicon wafers with a 400 nm-thick layer of thermal 
oxide layer substrate. A thin 50 nm-thick undoped amorphous-Si (a-Si) layer was deposited by 
low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) at 5500C. The deposited a-Si layer was then 
solid-phase recrystallized at 6000C for 24 hours in nitrogen ambient. The device active and ten 
NWs pattern were formed by electron beam (Ebeam) direct writing. The photoresist patterns were 
transferred by reactive ion etching (RIE) using Cl2/Ar mixed etchant gas. For stacked gate 
dielectrics, a 15 nm-thick layer of tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (TEOS) oxide as tunneling oxide, a 20 
nm-thick layer of silicon nitride (Si3N4) as electron trapping layer, and a 25 nm-thick layer of 
TEOS oxide as top blocking oxide were deposited by LPCVD. The relative thick blocking oxide 
is to prevent carriers from gate injection into charge trapping layer. Then a 150 nm-thick poly-Si 
layer was deposited and transferred to a gate electrode by Ebeam direct writing and RIE. Then, 
the self-aligned source, drain and gate regions were formed by the implantation of phosphorous 
ions at a dose of 5×1015 cm-2. The dopant was activated by ultra rapid thermal annealing at 
10000C for 1 sec in nitrogen ambient. After source, drain and gate implantation and activation, a 
300 nm-thick TEOS oxide layer was deposited as the passivation layer by LPCVD. Next, the 
contact holes were defined and 300 nm-thick AlSiCu metallization was performed. The devices 
were then sintered at 4000C in nitrogen ambient for 30 min. For the further study, a 10 nm-thick 
HfO2 as a charge trapping layer was also deposited by LPCVD on the other devices.

Table I. Operation principle and bias conditions utilized tri-gate NWs poly-Si TFT SONOS-NVM with W / L = 65 
nm ×10 / 2 um. 
 
Figure 3a plots the Id-Vg performance of a 2 bit storage operation for NWs poly-Si TFT 
SONOS-NVM with six discrete Id-Vg curves - (1,1), (1,0)-F, (1,0)-R, (0,1)-F, (0,1)-R and (0,0). 
The notation, (bit-S, bit-D)-read-mode, for example (1,0)-R, is bit-S in its erased state and bit-D 
programmed under reverse-read. To demonstrate the two-bit effect, a programming bias is first 
applied to write electrons into the bit-D by channel hot electron (CHE) injection (Vg = Vd = 14.5 
V, tp = 1s). The accelerated electrons are injected into the narrow region of the nitride layer near 
the drain junction (Fig. 1b). Then, the reverse read of Vread (Vs) = 5V was applied and Vg was 
swept, to yield the (1,0)-R curve. Second, a forward read of Vread (Vd) = 5V was applied to yield 
the (1,0)-F curve, and a significant threshold shift of ∆Vth = 2.2 V between these (1,0)-R and 
(1,0)-F curves is observed. The read voltage (Vs) is required to read out the information that is 
stored in bit-D. The applied read voltage must be large to screen out the injected charges at the 
bit-S. This reverse read maximizes the effect of the trapped charge on the Vth shift.11 The second 
bit (bit-S) is programmed and read by interchanging the roles of the two junctions, as shown in 
the (0,1)-F and (0,1)-R curves. The trapped charge localized in the narrow region next to the S/D 
region is key to the 2-bit storage capability.

layer 
 Figure 5a shows the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of the NWs poly-Si NVM. 
Figure 5b presents the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopic (TEM) photograph of 
one of the NWs. The photograph reveals the Pi-shaped gate, and the four corners of the NWs are 
surrounded by the control gate. The physical width of each NW of the ten channels is 65 nm. 
Figure 5c shows enlarged area of the HfO2 charge trapping layer that is polycrystalline. The HfO2 
thin-film was amorphous phase as deposited. After high temperature annealing for dopant 
activation, the HfO2 thin-film was transferred to polycrystalline. To study clearly the Pi-gate NWs 
structure effect, a conventional NVM with a single-channel (SC) and a Pi-gate NVM with three 
channels (M3) were also demonstrated. To study clearly the Pi-gate NWs structure effect, a 
conventional NVM with a single-channel (SC) and a Pi-gate NVM with three channels (M3) 
were also fabricated.

Where h  = modified Plank’s constant, q = electronic charge, E = electric field, oxφ  = barrier 
height, m* = electron effective mass. Obviously, the electric field and the barrier height play an 
important role for the tunneling current density. Figures 7 plot the Program/Erase (P/E) 
characteristics of the NWs, the M3 and the SC NVMs. Both programming and erasing operation 
use FN tunneling mechanism at Vgs=17 V, Vds= 0 V and Vgs= -23 V, Vds= 0 V, respectively. The 
P/E efficiency increases with the channel width decreasing. The Pi-gate NWs NVM shows best 
P/E characteristics than the M3 and the SC devices. In the NWs devices, the electric field at the 
sharp corner is much higher than at the other region due to the corner effect. Therefore, based

Another characteristic of HfO2, spatial isolated traps, also can promote the electron storage 
capability. After 109 s, for NWs NVM the charge loss is only 10% that is qualified for ten year 
data storage.

Fig. 8 High-temperature retention characteristics of Pi-gate NWs and SC poly-Si NVM with an HfO2 charge trapping 
layer. Inset plot shows the energy band diagrams in charge retention state after programming. 
Figure 9 plots the P/E cycling endurance characteristics obtained by FN programming and 
FN erasing. To improve the endurance, a higher Vth of 6.9 V was used in the programmed state. 
At high Vth, the charges in the charge trapping layer build a high electric field and tend to repel 
the electrons out of the charge trapping layer. Thus, the erasing time can be reduced to 100 μs for 
given a sufficient Vth shift (~ 2.6 V). Reducing the erase pulse width improves the endurance by 
reducing damage in the tunneling SiO2. After 103 and 105 P/E cycles, the memory widow is 2.36 
V and 1.37 V, respectively.

performance than that without NH3 plasma passivation. The significant improvement of retention 
suggests that the nitrogen passivated at SiO2/ploy-Si interface and hydrogen passivated the 
dangling bonds at ploy-Si grain boundaries [24], both help the tunnel SiO2 strength. In addition, 
the SC EEPROM shows better retention than NWs EEPROM. This result reveals that NWs has 
higher electrical field at the tri-gate corner tri-gate can improve P/E speed; however it degrade the 
retention for the same reason. The inset plot of Fig. 14 shows the retention of NWs EEPROM 
with NH3 plasma passivation. For ten years data storage requirement, the memory window still 
has 2 V.

Figure 17 shows the program/erase (P/E) cycling endurance characteristics by FN 
programming and FN erasing. For the both O/N-structure and O-structure EEPROM, the ∆Vth 
decreases with P/E cycling numbers increasing. This can be explained that the electrons trapping 
and detrapping effects in tunnel oxide. At beginning of FN programming, electrons are trapped in 
the existing trap states of tunnel oxide during programming, which reduces the oxide field and 
suppress electrons injection into floating gate. In addition, the trap states of tunnel oxide 
accumulate with P/E cycle numbers increasing. For both O-structure and O/N-structure EEPROM, 
the tunnel oxide was TEOS-oxide and formed by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, which 
has lower charge-to-breakdown characteristics than thermal oxide and N2O-plasama oxide [3]. 
For O-structure EEPROM, after 103 P/E cycles, the abnormal increasing of endurance 
characteristics shows the TEOS-oxide breakdown effect. However, for O/N-structure EEPROM

each trapping sites are individually. We suggest that the retention can be further improved by 
using thick tunneling oxide.

四、Conclusion (結論) 
The NWs structure was introduced to the poly-Si TFT flash memory and the Twin Poly-Si 
TFT EEPROM. Experimental results demonstrate that the NWs structure due to its superior gate 
control can improve the P/E characteristics obviously, and the HfO2 and the Si3N4 charge trapping 
layer enhances the retention characteristics. Due to the high speed P/E operations, the number of 
P/E cycles can reach up to 104 times for all the NWs poly-Si TFT memories and the NWs 
Twin-TFT EEPROM. In retention, using the HfO2 charge trapping layer in the NWs flash 
memory only lose 10 % electrons after 109 s at 150 oC. The retention of the NWs Twin-TFT 
EEPROM can be improved greatly by using Si3N3 charge trapping layer. These investigation 
would examine the feasibility of the NWs flash NVM and the NWs Twin-TFT EEPROM on 
future active matrix liquid crystal display system-on-panel (SOP) and 3-D layer-to-layer stacked
