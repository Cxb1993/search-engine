Abstract: 
The global positioning system (GPS) and the future advent of European Navigation system 
Galileo can provide accurate positioning and timing information useful in many applications. The 
GPS/Galileo satellites broadcast ranging codes and navigation data with the technique of direct 
sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS). Carrier phase information is necessary for accurate 
measurements in global positioning system (GPS) applications. This project presents a novel 
intelligent GPS carrier tracking loop with variable-bandwidth characteristics for fast acquisition 
and better tracking capability in the presence of dynamic environments. Our dual-loop receiver is 
composed of an FLL-assisted-PLL structure, the fuzzy controllers (FCs), and the ATAN 
discriminator functions. The soft-computing fuzzy controllers provide the time-varying loop 
gains to perform accurate and reliable control of the dual-loop paradigm. Once the phase dynamic 
errors become large under kinematic conditions, the fuzzy loop gains increase adaptively and 
achieve rapid acquisition. On the other hand, when the tracking errors approach zero in the steady 
state, the loop gains decrease and the corresponding dual-loop receiver returns to a narrowband 
system. Four types of carrier phase signals, i.e. phase offset, decaying sinusoidal phase jitter, 
frequency offset, and frequency ramp offset, are considered to emulate realistic mobile 
circumstances. Simulation results show that our proposed receiver does achieve a superior 
performance over conventional tracking loops in terms of faster settling time and wider 
acquisition range while preventing the occurrence of cycle slips.

2. Mobile Carrier Phase Models  
The conventional code and carrier tracking loops are shown in Fig. 1. The incoming GPS signal 
is mixed with in-phase and quadrate-phase replicas of the carrier, and also with prompt, advanced, 
and delayed replicas of the code. These waveforms are processed with the integrated-and-dump 
predetection filters in order to increase the signal SNR. Then the discrimination functions are 
utilized to provide signals that are proportional to the error of phase synchronization. Both carrier 
and code loops keep the signal synchronism tracking the frequency shifts due to the Doppler 
effects. By using the carrier-aided-code method, the Doppler information from the carrier loop 
can be extracted and fed into the code loop. Then, this scheme puts all the dynamic stress burdens 
on the carrier tracking loop.      
The integration and dump function blocks sum up their input data i ir IP  and i ir QP  for I and Q 
channels, respectively, with each correlation interval equal to sT M T   (where M is the 
decimation or downsample factor). Then the outputs of the digital accumulators kI  and kQ  
become

The relative motion between the satellite and GPS user is an extremely important factor in phase 
and frequency tracking loop design. The frequency ramp caused by the satellite motion (as much 
as 1 Hz/s) is usually small, so we consider only the motion of vehicles. It is assumed that the user 
has an acceleration of ca  (m/s

stress as well as under mild dynamic stress. On the other hand, the PLL can provide a smaller 
range of measurement error than the FLL. A dual-loop paradigm consisting of a second-order 
FLL assisting a third-order PLL and fuzzy controllers is employed in our design. This adaptive 
bandwidth approach can resolve the dilemma in GPS receiver design, especially in a high 
dynamic stress situation.   
In carrier loop design, the tradeoff of noise bandwidth determination between two 
contradicting considerations is always involved. The thermal noise jitter is sensitive to the noise 
bandwidth. Decreasing noise bandwidth can reduce the thermal noise. Hence, it will in turn 
reduce the capability of the loop to track the Doppler-shifted carrier phase signal induced by user 
dynamics. For a conventional second-order PLL [7], the transfer function is given as:

The tracking loop can maintain lock for frequency step PO   and frequent ramp step 
PO  . In practice, the bandwidth of the carrier tracking loop is designed in the range of 5-15 
Hz for the GPS receiver to suppress the thermal noise jitter. For this nominal range of noise 
bandwidth, the pull-out and frequency ranges become very narrow. It is difficult to maintain lock 
for a narrow bandwidth PLL that is affected by severe Doppler environments.

(4) Intelligent controllers design: The fuzzy controllers for DFLL and DPLL, respectively, were 
designed. The proposed intelligent loop, acting as an adaptive-bandwidth mechanism, is 
employed to track the incoming carrier phase promptly in the presence of highly dynamic 
environments. Both phase variable sets ( keθ , , e,kω ) and ( e,kω , ke, ) (from Eq. (4.1) to (4.3)) are 
utilized as input parameters in the fuzzy controllers for DPLL and DFLL, respectively. The 
parameters DPF  and DFF  are their fuzzy outputs, which give the adaptive driving error to the 
digital filters in the loop. When the phase variable sets become large in the presence of significant 
accelerations, the fuzzy outputs can increase adaptively and perform rapid locking. 
Nine terms are defined for each linguistic variable in the FC design. They are very negative 
large (VNL), negative large (NL), negative medium (NM), negative small (NS), zero (ZE), 
positive small (PS), positive medium (PM), positive large (PL), and very positive large (VPL). 
We choose triangular-shaped membership functions (MFs) for the input and output variables. The 
inference mechanism based on the Mamdani algorithm [10] is utilized here. Fuzzy rule tables 
providing the knowledge base to the controller are illustrated in Fig. 3(b). These rules are 
expressed as 
simulations, four types of dual-loop schemes are compared, namely the proposed fuzzy dual-loop 
system, the conventional dual-loop type-I, the dual-loop type-II and the dual-loop type-III. The 
conventional fixed-bandwidth dual-loop is composed of simply a second-order DFLL assisting a 
third-order DPLL. Both noise bandwidths (Bn,p , Bn,f ) and filter coefficients for different types of 
dual-loop methods are illustrated in Table 2. The desired acquisition specifications are set as a 
locking range of 150 Hz and a frequency ramp range of 515 Hz/s (corresponding to 10 G 
acceleration). The complete rule tables for fuzzy controllers are shown in Fig. 3(b). Seven 
linguistic terms are used for each of the input variables, and 49/25 rules are developed in the 
intelligent controllers. The dynamic tests are conducted at a low value of CNR 35 dB-Hz, and 
each result is obtained from 2000 independent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.  
Fig. 5 shows the phase offset and phase error responses of each loop for the case of phase 
step input of 0 1 radian. It can be observed that the intelligent dual-loop method performs 
well and has a settling time of 108 ms for the 5% phase error specification. The conventional 
dual-loops type I, type II and type III require settling times of 168 ms, 145 ms, and 118 ms, 
respectively. Tracking performances of each loop for decaying phase jitter are illustrated in Fig. 6. 
A single-tone sinusoid corresponding to a jitter frequency of 16 Hz with amplitude 11 B  and 
decaying factor 41   is considered. It is seen that our fuzzy scheme can track the decaying 
jitter waveform promptly in both amplitude and phase. It appears that the fuzzy scheme does 
enhance the ability of the dual-loop receiver to track the carrier phase swiftly.  
We show in Table 3 the results of settling time versus Doppler frequency shift for each loop 
scheme, in which the frequency step 0f  changes from 20 Hz to 200 Hz. Our proposed dual-loop 
receiver can accomplish a significant improvement in terms of a shorter settling time than other 
conventional loops and thus achieve superior tracking capability. As can be seen, the cycle 
slipping phenomenon occurs in conventional loops when the frequency offset is larger than 60 Hz. 
By incorporating the fuzzy controllers into the carrier loop, the locking range and pull-in range 
can be extended to 150 Hz and 200 Hz, respectively. Given in Fig. 7(a) and (b) are the responses 
of the proposed dual-loop DPLL when an instantaneous 200 Hz frequency step is involved. Our 
fuzzy dual-loop algorithm provides a faster settling time of 112 ms for 5% frequency error 
specification. These simulation results verify the effectiveness of using the fuzzy method for 
faster pull-in speed and wider locking range. 
To further demonstrate the advantages of our proposed carrier tracking loop, the motion 
acceleration of vehicles ranging from 1 G to 10 G is simulated. Table 4 compares the simulated 
tracking performances of the fuzzy dual-loop system with those of the conventional methods 
under these severe mobile cases. Clearly, traditional loops with constant noise bandwidth can 
operate only in smaller frequency ramp ranges (up to almost 400 Hz/s). If the phase errors vary 
too rapidly, the conventional dual-loop DPLLs will not be able to pull in again and will 
eventually lose lock. On the other hand, the fuzzy controllers provide the adaptive gain in the 
carrier loop, and the acquisition performance of the dual-loop receiver can be significantly 
extended to 515 H/s. Fig. 8 shows the transient responses of the fuzzy receiver in a high-dynamic 
environment of 10 G acceleration. It requires only a settling time of 108 ms to obtain 5% 
frequency ramp error. The benefit of our dual-loop receiver is that a faster convergence rate and 
wider frequency ramp range can be achieved during kinematic periods. Table 5 shows the 
comparisons between three key parameters, i.e. locking range, pull-in range, and frequency ramp 
range, which govern the dynamic performances of a carrier loop. It is illustrated that our 
dual-loop paradigm can also achieve superior tracking capabilities compared to the conventional 
ones.
