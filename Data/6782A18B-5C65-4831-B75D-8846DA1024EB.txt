英文摘要 
In this study, a conjugate gradient method based inverse algorithm is applied to 
estimate the unknown fouling-layer profile on the inner wall of a pipe system using 
simulated temperature measurements taken within the pipe wall. The temperature data 
obtained from the direct problem are used to simulate the temperature measurements. 
The accuracy of the inverse analysis is examined by using simulated exact and inexact 
temperature measurements. Results show that an excellent estimation on the 
fouling-layer profile can be obtained for the test case considered in this study. The 
technique presented in this study can be used in a warning system to call for pipe 
maintenance when the thickness of fouling exceeds a pre-defined criterion.

computational domain cannot be 
determined due to the unknown 
boundary. Therefore, the inverse 
problem becomes extremely 
complicated. In the past, there have been 
many researchers devoted to the study of 
inverse geometry problems using a 
variety of numerical methods. Huang 
and Chen [5] developed a modified 
model to estimate the outer boundary 
configurations of a multiple region 
domain without confining the search 
directions. Park and Shin applied the 
coordinate transformation technique 
with the adjoint variable method to a 
shape identification problem in 
determining unknown boundary 
configuration for heat conduction 
systems [6] and natural convection 
systems [7]. Divo et al. [8] used the 
genetic algorithm and a singular 
superposition technique to detect the 
unknown sphere cavity in a 3D inverse 
geometry problem. Kwag et al. [9] 
followed a new algorithm to estimate the 
phase front motion of ice in a thermal 
storage system. Recently, Su and Chen 
[10] utilized the reversed matrix method 
with both the linear least-squares error 
method and the concept of virtual area 
for a shape identification problem to 
identify the geometry of inner wall in a 
furnace. Among those studies, it can be 
noted that there have been only very few 
studies on shape identification problem 
involving conjugate heat transfer which 
is commonly encountered in 
heat-exchanger problems. 
The performance of a heat exchanger 
usually deteriorates with time as a result 
of accumulation of deposits on 
heat-transfer surfaces. The layer of 
deposit (fouling) represents additional 
thermal resistance to heat transfer and 
causes the heat transfer rate of the heat 
exchanger to drop. In addition, the 
fouling could narrow the flow channel 
and result in an increase in pumping 
power. Since fouling is often formed on 
the inner wall of a heat-exchanger pipe, 
it is difficult to obtain the exact 
configuration of the fouling layer, 
especially if the pipe is very long. The 
objective of the present inverse 
geometry problem is to estimate the 
unknown irregular fouling profile on the 
inner wall of a pipe system, which 
involves conjugate heat transfer, based 
on the simulated temperature 
measurements taken within the pipe wall. 
The system includes a fully developed 
pipe flow, solid pipe wall, and a fouling 
layer which is built up on the pipe’s 
inner wall and whose profile is unknown. 
This technique can be used in a warning 
system to call for pipe maintenance 
when the thickness of fouling exceeds a 
pre-defined criterion. In this article, we 
present the conjugate gradient method 
(CGM) [11-13] and the discrepancy 
principle [14] solving the inverse 
geometry problem to determine the 
fouling layer configuration in the pipe 
system.

problem is given in Fig. 2(a), where the 
r-coordinate has been amplified 6 times 
to allow the profile of the fouling layer 
to be seen clearer. Figure 2 (b) shows the 
temperature contours of the direct 
problem. The undermining effect of the 
fouling layer on rate of heat transfer can 
be readily realized from the contour plot 
which shows more relaxed contour lines 
at places where the fouling layer 
becomes thicker, signifying a smaller 
temperature gradient and less amount of 
heat transfer 
In this study, the thermocouples are 
assumed located on the internal surface 
of the solid pipe, namely 0.25mr = m. 
Here, we do not have a real 
experimental set up to measure the 
temperature ( , )i mY x r  in Eq. (6).  
Instead, we assume a real profile of the 
fouling layer, ( )f x  of Eq. (22), and 
substitute the exact ( )f x  into the 
direct problem of Eqs. (1)-(5) to 
calculate the temperatures at the 
locations where the thermocouples are 
placed. The results are taken as the 
computed temperature ( , )exact i mY x r . 
Meanwhile, in order to consider the 
situation of measurement errors, a 
random error noise is added to the above 
computed temperature ( , )exact i mY x r to 
obtain the measured temperature 
( , )i mY x r . Hence, the measured 
temperature ( , )i mY x r  is expressed as 
( , ) ( , )i m exact i mY x r Y x r ϖσ= + ,      (25) 
where ϖ  is a random variable within  
-2.576~2.576  for a 99% confidence 
bounds, and σ  is the standard 
deviation of the measurement. 
The inverse solutions obtained from 
the numerical experiments with the 
initial guess profiles 0 ( ) 0.24f x =  and 
0 ( ) 0.20f x =  with no measurement 
errors are shown in Fig. 3. The plot 
shows that the estimated values of f(x) 
are almost identical to the exact values 
and are independent with the values of 
initial guess. Fig. 4 depicts the estimated 
and exact temperature profiles on the 
measurement points. It can be noted in 
Fig. 4 that the predicted temperatures are 
in excellent agreement with the exact 
results and again, are independent with 
the initial guess. Once the fouling-layer 
boundary profile has been correctly 
estimated, accurate temperature 
distributions within the entire domain 
can also be obtained. This is 
demonstrated in Fig. 5, the field 
temperature distributions along the 
radial direction at three different axial 
locations, namely x = 0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 
2.5 m. Here, one can see that the 
predicted temperature distributions are 
almost identical to the exact values at all 
locations. 
Fig. 6 illustrates the inverse 
solutions of f(x) obtained with the initial 
guess profile 0 ( ) 0.24f x =  and 
measurement error of deviation σ = 
0.005. For a temperature of unity and 
99% confidence, that standard deviation, 
σ = 0.005, corresponds to measurement 
error of 1.28%. This plot reveals that, 
for the cases considered in this study, an 
increase in the measurement error does
