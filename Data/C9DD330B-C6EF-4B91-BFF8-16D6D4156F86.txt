Standalone personal computers can only simulate 3D film structures at present. The 
enormous requirements by larger structures of both memory space and computation time can 
not be satisfied by one single machine. Consequently, our simulations were carried out using 
the message passing interface (MPI) library [3] on a cluster system.

ξ  is the intrinsic impedance in air (about 377Ω ). 0A  denotes the beam amplitude. centerx  
and centerz  are, respectively, the x- and the z-coordinates of the center of the photonic crystal. 
0τ  = 80 fs, 0t  = 3 0τ . The center wavelength is 4.4 μm. The woodpile structure, portrayed in 
Figure 1, consists of an array of layers of 10 tungsten rods that repeat themselves every 4 
layers with period c; h = c/4 is the thickness of the rods. The lattice constant is a = 4.2 μm, 
the rod width w = 1.2 μm; the spacing between the rods in the same layer d = 4.2 μm - 1.2 μm 
= 3 μm. In our finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations the permittivity ε of the 
metal is obtain from Drude’s free electron model [4], namely,

3D WOODPILE SIMULATION RESULTS 
The transmittance, reflectance and absorptance of the woodpile structure are plotted in 
Figure 2 for h = 1.5 μm, 1.8μm and 2.1 μm from left to right. The absorptance is obtained by 
subtracting the reflectance and the transmittance from 1. In the case of h = 1.5 μm, for 
example, there are two transmission peaks at 4.6 μm and 6.1 μm, respectively. The respective 
transmittances at the two peaks are 0.74 and 0.67. The peak at 4.6 μm is due to surface 
plasmon, which will be discussed later. The transmittance approaches zero when wavelength 
analyzed the reason why such structures have large long-wavelength bandgaps. We showed 
that the absorptance increases with thickness. By means of single layer analysis, the 
phenomena of transmission and absorption are readily realized. 
 
Figure 1. The woodpile structure. It consists of an array of layers of tungsten rods that repeat themselves every 
four layers with period c. h = c/4 is the thickness of the rods. The lattice constant is a = 4.2 μm, the rod width w 
= 1.2 μm. The spacing between the rods in the same layer d =3 μm. 
 
 
 Fig. 3. (a) The transmittance of electric field parallel to the rods. When the wavelength is longer than 6 μm, the 
transmittance decreases significantly; the peak is at 4.6 μm when h = 1.5 μm. When h is increased, the curve 
near 6 μm becomes sharper. (b) The transmittance of magnetic field parallel to the rods. There is a transmission 
dip at 4.2 μm, the wavelength at which the surface plasmon is excited. Waveguide resonance results in high 
transmission at long wavelengths.
