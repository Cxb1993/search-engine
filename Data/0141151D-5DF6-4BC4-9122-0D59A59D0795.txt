（二）計畫英文摘要。 
To deliver future increased bandwidth services economically, carriers need to reduce the unit cost 
of bandwidth. One of the cost-effective access architectures of fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) is the 
passive optical network (PON). Gigabit PONs (GPONs) are now standardized and commercially 
available. They typically offer 2.5 Gb/s downstream and ~1 Gb/s upstream, shared among 32 
optical networking units (ONUs) located at users’ sides via passive optical splitters, over a reach 
of up to 20 km. Although these PONs provide significant bandwidth increases compared to 
copper-based approaches, they may not provide the best ultimate solution for carriers seeking to 
reduce the cost significantly. Hence, they will ask “What comes next after GPON?”  
One of the most interesting topics is to increase the data rate of PON from 1 Gb/s to 10 Gb/s 
and even to 40 Gb/s. However, scaling up from 10 Gb/s to 40 Gb/s PON is very challenging. In 
this project, we have proposed and demonstrated several network architectures to achieve high 
data rate access network up to 40 Gb/s. We have also provided solutions for several technical 
issues.  
 We believed that we have fulfilled the original project proposal and met the targets by 
proposing and demonstrating a number of promising 40 Gb/s PON architectures. This project can 
build up the high data rate (up to 40 Gb/s) FTTH technologies for our partner in this project: 
PHYTREX Tech. Corp., which devoted to offer advanced photonic and FTTH technologies from 
equipments to system integration solutions to customers. The project has generated a number of 
internal journal publications, conference papers and patent application.

 Fig. 1.1 shows the schematic of a 40 Gb/s LR-PON implementing directly modulated 
VCSEL array as the upstream Tx. WDM is used to improve the bandwidth utilization of fiber. 
The downstream signal is a single 40 Gb/s channel generated by external modulation. It will be 
sent to the ONUs via the long reach feeder fiber, which is dispersion compensated and a remote 
node (RN), which consists of optical amplifiers. In the ONU, each laser in the VCSEL array is 
directly modulated at 10 Gb/s. The upstream signal is formed by wavelength multiplexing four of 
these channels using a WDM coupler having channel separation of ~ 25 GHz. This is to ensure 
the 4 ╳ 10 Gb/s upstream signal can pass through the pass-band of the arrayed waveguide grating 
(AWG) (200 GHz channel spacing). The upstream signal will then be detected by the head-end 
burst-mode Rxs, which are synchronized by the MAC. 
 
(2) Using OOK modulation for symmetric 40-Gb/s long reach PONs [10] 
In the second part, we proposed and demonstrated a simple architecture to achieve 40 Gb/s long 
reach (LR) time-division multiplexed (TDM)-PON using four WDM 10 Gb/s external modulated 
distributed feedback laser diodes (DFB-LDs) acting as the optical transmitters for downstream 
and upstream directions. As a result, a 40 Gb/s traffic can be efficiently achieved without 
changing the network infrastructure. Besides, the proposed 40 Gb/s LR TDM-PON requires a 
moderate upgrade of components at the optical networking unit (ONU) and the optical line 
terminal (OLT). The synchronization of these four externally modulated DFB-LDs and the four 
burst-mode Rxs is performed in the MAC layer. These LR-PONs would replace the separate 
metro and access networks with a single and integrated system. This approach is expected to 
produce significant capital and operational cost savings, since the number of network elements 
and interfaces can be reduced, together with the design complexity and power consumption.

Fig. 3.1. Experimental setup of proposed 40 Gb/s TDM-PON architecture. 
 The experimental setup of the proposed 40 Gb/s TDM-PON architecture is illustrated in Fig. 
3.1. In this system, we used 1.5 and 1.3 μm bands for the downstream and upstream traffics. In 
the OLT, there were four distributed feedback laser diodes (DFB-LDs) connecting to four MZMs 
and a four-port wavelength multiplexed filter. We used external modulation in the downstream 
signal; however, direct modulation can be used. In the remote node (RN), a 1×32 optical splitter 
(SP) was employed. In each optical networking unit (ONU), four DFB-LDs were connected to 
the four-port wavelength-multiplexed filter. The four DFB-LDs used were commercially 
available, with directly modulation bandwidth of up to 3 GHz. The 1.3/1.5 μm WDM coupler 
(WC) is used to multiplex and de-multiplex the downstream and upstream paths.
