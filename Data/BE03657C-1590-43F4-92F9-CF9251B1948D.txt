Abstract
This project is to development MR mount
for supporting the engine and in the mean time
attenuating engine vibrations. MR mounts are
used to fulfill the high yield stress demand not
possibly met by previously developed ER
mounts. The project first derives mathematical
model of an MR mount, followed by computer
simulation of the control algorithms of adaptive
sliding mode controller for suppressing
vibration. Secondly, the project designs an MR
mount with an aid of magnetic field analysis.
The experimental setup for testing the MR
mount is to be constructed and performance of
the MR mount controlled by the adaptive
sliding mode controller are to be verified.
Keywords: MR mount, adaptive sliding mode
controller
2.INTRODUCTION
For vibration attenuation purpose, many
kinds of products have been developed, such as
dampers, shock absorbers and suspension
system, etc. Severe vibration of a system can
cause damage, even leading to safety problem.
A lot of passive devices are used in engineering
application to absorb or isolate unwanted
vibration, but the adaptive ability of passive
devices is poor. The semi-active control could
provide better performance than the passive
control, which has been stated in many fields
by many researchers. Compared to the active
control, the semi-active control has many
advantages, such as low power requirement,
higher reliability and simpler structure, etc
[1-6].
Recently, smart materials are applied
widely and rapidly, such as liquid crystal,
piezoelectric ceramics [7], magnetorheological
fluids, and electro-rheological fluids [8], etc.
MR fluid consists of micron-sized,
magnetically polarizable particles dispersed in
silicone oil [9]. MR fluid with viscous damping
property can be effectively controlled by the
magnetic field (generally controlled by
adjusting the current to the electromagnetic
coil). Specifically, MR fluid has board
operational temperature (-40 to +150 Co ) , fast
response time (less than milliseconds), low
power requirement (2-50 watts), and high yield
stress (50–100 kPa ) [10]. Actuators
incorporating these advantages have prominent
potentials for vibration suppression, under
complex and varied environment.
However, an MR system under operation
and for all ),[ 0  tt .
Remark: Eq. (4) is obtained by assuming that
yield stress of the MR fluid in driven flow
mode )(Hyf is much greater than that in
direct shear mode )(Hys .

ABSTRACT 
In this paper a Kalman filter fitted in the feedback active noise control system is employed for 
suppressing duct noise. The secondary path of a duct noise system is modeled by an IIR filter, 
whereas the controller filter is modeled by an FIR filter. The secondary path dynamics is 
obtained by an off-line system identification technique. The controller FIR filter is tuned on-line 
by the developed Kalman algorithm. Computer simulations show that Kalman algorithm 
outperforms the FXLMS algorithm in minimizing the duct noise, especially for multi-tone noise 
and white noise. To verify the effectiveness of the Kalman algorithm, experiments are conducted 
for duct noise suppression. A TI TMS320C6713 DSP is used for implementing the complex 
Kalman algorithm. While the Kalman algorithm and the FXLMS algorithm may have 
comparable performance in reducing pure-tone duct noise, noises with two-tone or more (even 
the narrowband white noise) can be shown experimentally to be reduced more by using the 
Kalman algorithm than the FXLMS algorithm. The experiment results indicated that up to 30dB 
and 20dB reductions was measured for two-tone and three-tone noise by using the Kalman 
algorithm, respectively, while a 6.8dB reduction is observed for a 200-300 narrowband white 
noise. Finally, a fan operating at 750Hz is used as a noise source, the Kalman algorithm is shown 
to achieve a 7.5dB noise reduction and only 3 dB noise suppression is obtained by using the 
FXLMS algorithm.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The propagation of sound waves and intensity/attenuation of sound fields in an enclosed space 
had been identified as early as in ancient Greece

. However, noise-related research in duct or 
engine exhaust pipe only started in the early twenty century.  Developing passive muffler for 
automobile use was the focus of the research at that time.  Paul Leug

 filed the first active noise 
control (ANC) patent in 1936 for duct noise reduction.  In the recent 20 years, due to the rapid

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In this section, an experimental setup for active duct noise control is constructed as shown in 
Figure 2. A TI TMS320C6713 DSP is employed for implementing the FXLMS and Kalman 
algorithms for noise suppression at the error microphone, placed at the right hand side of the duct. 
Due to the rapid processing of the DSP controller, a sampling rate of 8k Hz is used in the 
experiment. A loudspeaker is attached to the left side of the duct for generating the primary 
noises. In the experiments, pure-tone, two-tone, three-tone, and a 200~300 band-limited white 
noises are generated by the noise loudspeaker, while a fan operating at 750 Hz is adopted in 
replace of the noise loudspeaker for realistically simulating flow-induced duct noise. The 
secondary path of the duct noise system modeled by an IIR filter is first obtained by an off-line 
system identification technique. An IIR filter of order 100 (60 moving-average coefficients, 40 
auto-regressive coefficients) is adequate for the secondary path model of the duct system. An 
FIR filter of order 20 is used for modeling the controller, whose coefficients are to be tuned by 
adaptive algorithm of respective FXLMS and Kalman.
