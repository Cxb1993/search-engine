1. Introduction 
To authenticate and protect the secret information transmitted between a sender and 
a receiver on the Internet, the traditional approach is that the sender first uses a digital 
signature scheme [1] to sign the message. Then, the sender encrypts both the message 
and the signature using a symmetric encryption algorithm, such as AES [2] or DES 
[3]. Nevertheless, this kind of “signature-then-encryption” approach has high 
computation costs. Therefore, Zheng [4] firstly proposed an authenticated encryption 
scheme (it is also called the signcryption scheme), which combines the functions of 
the digital signature and encryption schemes in one logical step. Compared with the 
signature-then-encryption approach, the authenticated encryption scheme has lower 
computation costs. From then on, various authenticated encryption schemes are 
proposed [5-12]. 
However, we find that the previous authenticated encryption schemes have to 
generate and verify the digital signature to accomplish message authentication and 
confidentiality. For some applications, the receiver only wants to ensure that the 
message is really sent by the correct sender, but he/she does not want to obtain the 
sender’s signature. In order to confirm the message is really sent by a valid sender, 
verifying the sender’s signature is inefficient for the receiver. Up to now, no research 
discusses the above-mentioned circumstance. In addition, there is no practicable 
scheme which combines the functions of message authentication and encryption 
without constructing the digital signature. 
Therefore, we propose an efficient authenticated encryption scheme based on 
elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). In the proposed scheme, the sender uses his/her 
private key and the receiver’s public key to construct a symmetric key for encrypting 
the message as a cipher. After that, the receiver can utilize his private key to 
reconstruct the same symmetric key for decrypting the cipher to obtain the message.

The signcryption phase: 
  In this phase, the sender Alice signs and encrypts a message m and sends the 
signcryption messages including the signature (V, S) to the receiver Bob. The steps 
are shown as follows. 
 
Step 1. Alice randomly chooses two integers R and k in Zq*. 
Step 2. Alice computes )||||||mod(1 B
k yRmpgHV =  and qxVks A mod⋅+=  
to generate pgS s mod=  and )mod(2 pyHK
s
B= , where “||” is denoted 
as string concatenation. 
Step3. Alice computes )||( RmEC K=  and sends the signcrypted text (C, V, S) to 
Bob, where (V, S) is the signature of the message m.  
 
The unsigncryption phase: 
  In this phase, Bob decrypts the cipher C to obtain the message m and verifies the 
7 
 
Alice’s signature. Second, the signature (V, S) is directly sent to Bob via an open 
channel without performing any asymmetric or symmetric encryption algorithm. Thus, 
anyone can wiretap the communications between Alice and Bob to obtain (V, S). For 
some applications, this situation is very dangerous because the digital signature may 
be an important document. For example, a digital signature may be the electronic cash 
or electronic check on electronic payment systems so the signature cannot be 
revealed.  
Similarly, the previous authenticated encryption schemes [5-12] have the 
above-mentioned drawbacks. That is, all these schemes have to construct and verify 
the digital signature for the authentication. To overcome the above drawbacks, we 
propose a new authenticated encryption scheme without constructing digital signature 
in the next section. 
 
3. The proposed authenticated encryption scheme and its applications 
  In this section, we propose an efficient authenticated encryption scheme without 
involving the digital signature. In addition, we also use the authenticated encryption 
scheme to design an electronic payment system. 
 
3.1. An efficient authenticated encryption scheme 
To reduce the computation cost, we adopt elliptic curve cryptography [13, 14] to 
design our authenticated encryption scheme. The proposed scheme is divided into 
three phases: the initialization phase, the authenticated encryption phase, and the 
verification phase. Now, we describe the proposed scheme as follows. 
 
The initialization phase: 
In this phase, the system initializes and selects some parameters as follows. 
9 
 
)||||||( 11 TkMIDEC Ak=  and sends (C, R, T) to Bob, where AID  is the 
identity of Alice and T is a timestamp. 
 
The verification phase: 
  In this phase, Bob decrypts the cipher C to obtain the message M, and he verifies 
that if M is really sent by Alice. 
 
Step 1. After receiving (C, R, T), Bob computes ),(* 21 kkRdK B ==  to obtain the 
common symmetric key 1k . 
Step 2. Bob uses 1k  to decrypt the cipher by )(|||||| 11 CDTkMID kA = , and he 
checks if T is valid or not. If T is valid, then Bob checks if 1k  is the same as 
that he computes in Step 1. If T and 1k  are both correct, then Bob makes sure 
that M is actually sent by Alice. Otherwise, Bob rejects it.

bank. Both the payer and the merchant already have their own accounts in the bank.  
 
The initializing phase: 
  In this phase, the system initializes and generates some public parameters ),( baEq , 
)(⋅kE , )(⋅kD , and Q as defined in Section 3. In addition, the system publishes 
),( baEq , )(⋅kE , )(⋅kD , and Q. 
The buying phase: 
  In this phase, the payer Alice downloads good information (GI) that he/she wants to 
buy from the merchant’s website. Here, the goods may be the electronic goods such as 
software, music, or movie. Then, Alice uses GI to generate the payment information 
and utilizes the proposed authenticated encryption scheme to encrypt the payment 
information. After that, she sends the encrypted information to the bank for paying the 
money. In this e-payment scheme, Alice, the bank, and the merchant have their 
private/public key pairs AA Ud / , BB Ud / , and MM Ud / , where QdU AA *= , 
QdU BB *= , and QdU MM *= , respectively. Now, we describe the steps of this 
phase as follows. 
 
Step 1. Alice chooses the goods and downloads GI = {(goods_1, price_1), (goods_2, 
price_2), …, (goods_l, price_l)} from the merchant’s website, where goods_i 
and price_i ( li ...,,2,1= ) are denoted as the information and the price of the 
electronic goods i, respectively. 
Step 2. Alice randomly selects an integer qZr ∈  to compute AUrR *= . 
Step 3. Alice computes BUrR *=  and ),(* 21 kkRdK A == , where 1k  and 2k  
are x and y coordinates of K, respectively. 
Step 4. Alice generates the payment information )||||( BIDPADHm = , where 
13 
 
key 1k . Then, the bank computes )(|||||||| 111 1 CDTkPmID kA =  and checks 
if 1T  is valid or not. 
Step 2. The bank also checks if 1k  is equal to the key computed in Step 1. If 1T  and 
1k  are both correct, then the bank accepts this transaction. Otherwise, the 
bank rejects it. 
Step 3. According to AID  and P, the bank withdraws the money from Alice’s 
account and deposits the money to a temporary account. Next, the bank 
computes EmM ||= , where E is the expiration date. The bank also uses Bd  
to generate a digital signature DS of M by using any ECC-based signature 
scheme such as [20, 21]. Then, the bank records {DS, M} in its database. 
Step 5. The bank uses 1k  to compute )||||||( 212 1 TkEDSEC k=  and sends 
),( 22 TC  to Alice, where 2T  is the timestamp. 
Step 6. After receiving ),( 22 TC , Alice computes )(|||||| 221 1 CDTkEDS k= . Then, 
she checks if 1k  and 2T  are correct or not. If 1k  and 2T  are both correct, 
then she accepts the signature DS as a paying proof. Otherwise, she rejects it.

Step 4. According to GI, the merchant computes ∑

the bank’s public key BU  to verify DS with M [20, 21]. If DS is valid, then 
the merchant computes )('

goods. Next, the merchant sends 4C  to Alice and keeps the record of {DS, M } 
in its database for double-spending checks.

4.1. Security analysis 
  In this subsection, we perform some possible attacks on the proposed authenticated 
scheme to analyze its security as follows. 
Replay attack: 
  Assume that an attacker wiretaps the communication between the sender (Alice) 
and the receiver (Bob), and the attacker can obtain the message (C, R, T), where 
)||||||( 11 TkMIDEC Ak= . Then, the attacker may re-send (C, R, T) to Bob to pretend 
that he/she is Alice. However, this attack is infeasible because C contains the 
timestamp T, which denotes the real sending time. That is, Bob can discover the 
message (C, R, T) is sent from an attacker by checking T. Therefore, the proposed 
scheme can prevent the replay attack. 
Outsider attack: 
  Assume that an attacker collects the information (C, R, T) from the communication 
between Alice and Bob. Then, the attacker tries to get the message M form C. To 
decrypt C, the attacker has to know the symmetric key k1. However, the attacker 
cannot obtain k1 which is computed by ),(* 21 kkRdK A ==  or 
),(* 21 kkRdK B == . This attack is impossible because the attacker needs to face the 
difficulty of elliptic curve discrete logarithm (ECDLP) [13, 14]. Therefore, the 
outsider attack does not work for the proposed scheme.  
Impersonating attack: 
  Assume that an attacker impersonates Alice to send a forged message to Bob, and 
then he/she randomly chooses an integer qZr ∈'  to compute AUrR '*'= . Thus, the 
attacker chooses a forged private key 'Ad to compute BUrR '*'= , 
19 
 
authenticated encryption scheme of Subsection 3.1. That is, only Alice can compute 
1k  by ),(* 21 kkRdK A ==  and encrypt m by )||||||||( 111 1 TkPmIDEC Ak= . 
When the bank computes the same 1k  to decrypt 1C , it can checks the correctness of  
1k  to make sure that m is really sent by Alice. Similarly, only the bank can compute  
1k  to encrypt )||||||( 212 1 TkEDSEC k= . Thus, Alice can ensure that the message 
)||||||( 21 TkEDS  is really sent from the bank without verifying DS.  
 
Integrity: 
  The proposed e-payment system provides the message integrity because the 
payment information is sent by the ciphertext form, such as 1C , 2C , and 3C . No 
one can alter the payment information without knowing the symmetric keys 1k  and 
'
1k . If R , 
'R , 1T , 2T , or 31T  is changed by an attacker, the valid receivers can 
discover the change by decrypting the cipher to check them. According to the above 
reasons, the proposed e-payment system provides the message integrity. 
 
Privacy protection: 
  The proposed e-payment system protects the buying privacy because the good 
information GI is protected by the one-way hash function )(⋅H . The bank cannot 
obtain GI from )||||( BIDPGIHm = , and thus the buying privacy can be protected 
from the bank. Besides, the payer’s identification is not sent to the merchant in the 
exchanging phase. Moreover, the digital signature DS does not contain any payer’s 
information. Therefore, the merchant does not know who the payer is. According to 
the above reasons, the buying privacy can be protected in the proposed e-payment 
system.
