IV. SIMULATION
The simulation includes longitudinal control with coupling of wheel and pitch, lateral control with
coupling of roll and heading. LQR approach is employed in both the longitudinal and lateral loop design.

Abstract:
This paper proposes an approach of fuzzy
intelligence control to Elebike (electrical power-aided
bicycle). A configuration of the overall system
composed of rider intelligence controller, fuzzy logic
controller (FLC ) and bike plant is proposed. The FLC
of Mamdani type is composed of fuzzifier, inference
and defuzzifier. Based on plant parameters, three
simulations regarding system free of FLC, system with
general FLC and system with normalized FLC are
given. Simulation results point out that traditional
Elebikes incorporated with added-on normalized FLC
are proved to be a better approach to supply auxiliary
e-power with right amount on proper time to help the
rider. Therefore the rider will be satisfied with the bike
speed no matter how poor are the road conditions or
how defective are the rider’s physical conditions.
Keywords:
Fuzzy logic controller, Intelligence, Control,
Elebike, bike
1. Introduction
The so-called “Elebike” is a bike with aided
electrical power to supplement the insufficiency of
rider’s pedal power. In case of various road conditions,
such as gravelly road, tarry-paved road uphill road and
cement-paved road, the rider may meet difficulty in
supplying sufficient power to acquire the speed as he
pleases especially for weak and sick aged persons.
Therefore in this paper we provide a fuzzy logic
controller (FLC) together with a power amplifier to the
traditional bike as schemed in Fig.1
As understanding of the traditional Elebike, the
driver of most Elebikes applies pedal force to get his
bike started. As soon as the bike speed reaches certain
threshold speed (say 3.5 km/hr), auxiliary electrical
power is then activated and aided to the mechanical
pedal power by rotating the swivel handle as shown in
Fig.2.
Fig. 1 Mechanism of traditional Elebike
Fig. 2 Electrical and mechanical power
The amount of electrical power applied at any
instant depends on the linear displacement of the swivel.
Due to nonlinear road friction, air drag and air damping,
the rider usually has no expertise to determine the
optimal amount of electrical power. Therefore the
fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is employed to replace the
swivel handle so as to solve the nonlinear problems.
2. Configuration of Overall System
A scheme of the overall system composed of rider,
FLC and Elebike plant is given in Fig. 3. The dashed
lines to close the loop imply that the rider’s inteligence 
works as the system controller to generate the system
error. Symbols in Fig. 3 are defined as follows:
Tv : Target velocity of Elebike.
v : Elebike velocity.
pf : Pedal force.
pτ: Bike wheel torque generated by pedal.
The rule surface corresponding to the fuzzy table is
given in Fig.7.

4. Simulation and Results
Fig.3 shows the rider’s intelligence working as the
system controller without fuzzy controller incorporated.
With fuzzy controller incorporated, the system will be a
controller of parallel-serial type. In order to make
compa- rison of the performance between the two cases
with and without fuzzy controller, Two simulations are
given as follows.
