二、 前言, 研究目的, 文獻探討
Recent advances in processor, radio and memory technology have generated a great interest in
the notion of deploying a large number of networked sensors for applications like environment
monitoring. The classification of target objects, as well as their tracking, are the fundamental
requirements in these applications [1], [2], [8], [10], [11], [17]. In this report, we consider a
wireless sensor network (WSN) that consists of N geographically dispersed sensors, wireless (and
hence noisy) one-way communication links and a fusion center. Limitation on the communication
bandwidth in wireless links due to the consideration of economical energy consumption at local
sensors prevents the system from conveying raw observation data to the fusion center. A local
compression on the raw observation data thus has to be employed at each sensor. Usually, the
information content of the compressed outputs from local sensors is of fewer bits than log2(M)
in a WSN, where M is the number of object classes to be distinguished. In this work, we are
specifically concerned with the case where the sensor nodes only send out binary decisions to
the fusion center at which they are fused to produce the final M -ary decision.
Another issue that may be encountered in a WSN is that sensors are prone to be blocked
or even damaged when they are deployed in a harsh environment [1]. In addition, a low-
cost sensor that is manufactured by a simple technology may suffer from hardware, as well
as software, malfunctions after deployment. As a result, the fault-tolerance capability to protect
against unexpected sensor failures is also of equal importance to the performance and complexity
of a WSN.
To fulfill the above mentioned requirements, a distributed classification fusion approach using
error correcting codes (DCFECC) has been proposed to provide good fault-tolerance capability
under feasible system complexity [18]. In the proposed approach, an M × N error-correcting
code matrix is first designed by either simulated annealing or cyclic column replacement, where
each row of N bits forms a codeword that corresponds to one ofM hypotheses. Each local sensor

Fig. 1. System model for distributed classification fusion system using error correcting codes (DCFECC).
As depicted in Fig. 1, we consider the distributed M -ary classification problem in a parallel
fusion network, which is perhaps the topology that has received the most attention in the
area of WSNs [3], [4], [9], [10], [11], [12], [14], [19]. In this problem, all the local sensors
observe the same phenomenon that statistically belongs to one of the M possible classes.
Independent interferences are assumed present at the local sensors, which, in mathematics, makes
the local observations {yj}Nj=1 conditionally independent across sensors given each hypothesis.
Also assume that each local sensor classifies its own observation, independent of all others, to
one of the M hypotheses using its own decision rule. In other words, the local sensor nodes
need not employ identical decision rules. We then denote by h(j)`|i the probability of classifying
H` given that Hi is the true hypothesis for sensor j.
After the observation is locally classified at sensor j, a local output bit u∗j is transmitted through
a noisy channel to the fusion center at which place the N received bits are combined to yield
the fusion decision. Due to channel transmission errors, the word u = (u1, u2, . . . , uN) received
at the fusion center may not equal the transmitted word u∗ = (u∗1, u

N). In this report,
we assume that the event of link error, i.e., [uj 6= u∗j ], is independent for all the communication
links between sensors and the fusion center, and is also independent of the observations {yj}Nj=1

z`,j,
where “⊕” denotes the exclusive-OR operation and z`,j , 2(uj ⊕ c`,j)− 1, it can be anticipated
that the analysis of the system performance relies completely on the probabilities of events
[z`,j = 1] and [z`,j = −1]. Note that given the true hypothesis isHi, the more negative the quantity∑N
j=1 zi,j , the smaller the fusion error is. This induces the necessity of finding a good probability
bound for sum of independent random variables {zi,j}Nj=1 given Hi is the true hypothesis in the
following. For notational simplicity, we drop the redundant subscript i in zi,j in the derivation
below.
Lemma 1: Let {Zj}∞j=1 be independent antipodal random variables with
Pr[Zj = 1] = qj and Pr[Zj = −1] = 1− qj.

Remark: Since λm < 0, Im(0) remains the same if we re-define Im(x) as supθ≥0[θx− ϕm(θ)].
Hence, with the assumption of λm < 0, the result of Lemma 1 can be re-expressed as:

The probability bound in (1) does not exhibit any apparent relation with λm, namely the
average of the means of {Zi}mi=1. This can be amended by the next lemma.

Pr {Z1 + · · ·+ Zm ≥ 0} ≤ (1− λ2m)m/2.

Theorem 1 provides an upper bound on the probability of error by means of Lemma 1. Based
on Lemma 2, the next corollary shows that the upper bound in (3) can be further upper-bounded
by quantities that are only functions of the negative quantity defined in (2). As a result, the
intuition that a DCFECC code with larger pair-wise Hamming distances is expected to perform
better can be justified.
Corollary 1: Under condition (2), the average probability of minimum-Hamming distance
fusion error can also be bounded above by:

Proof: The proof of inequality (5) follows a similar procedure as in Theorem 1 except that
Lemma 2 is used instead of Lemma 1. Inequality (6) is a direct consequence of inequality (5).
With the above corollary, we figure that if for some δ > 0, λmax < −δ for all sufficiently large

where the last step follows from the central limit theorem for sum of independent bounded
variables. Thus, the claim of the theorem holds for the case that d(c`, ci) tends to infinity.
In situations when d(c`, ci) is bounded as N approaches infinity (in which case a bad DCFECC
code design results), the theorem is trivially valid.
The final lemma in this section shows that the upper bounds in Corollary 1, as well as the
expression of λmax, can be greatly simplified for identical sensor systems.
Lemma 3: Suppose that ²j = ² for 1 ≤ j ≤ N , where 0 ≤ ² < 1/2, and h(j)k|i = hk|i is the

that yj is Gaussian distributed with mean ` and variance 1/γo given that hypothesis H` is true.

large number of hypotheses under classification may still be encountered in practice. This raises
the research issue on how to find a DCFECC code that performs well for a large sensor network.
At a first glance, one may think that the minimization of λmax defined in Corollary 1 is a good
alternative criterion for code search for a large sensor network. Yet, a simple example with N =
M = 2, ²1 = ²2 = ², h
(1)
0|1 = h
(1)
1|0 = 1/4 and h
(2)
0|1 = h
(2)
1|0 = 3/8 indicates that the code matrix that
minimizes the resultant λmax = −[(1−2²)/4][2(c0,1⊕c1,1)+(c0,2⊕c1,2)]/[(c0,1⊕c1,1)+(c0,2⊕c1,2)]
should satisfy (c0,1⊕c1,1) = 1 and (c0,2⊕c1,2) = 0, and can be shown straightforwardly not to be
the most fault-tolerant design of (c0,1⊕c1,1) = (c0,2⊕c1,2) = 1 for M = 2. It can be conjectured
from the error bound in (6) that a good criterion to be minimized should be a function of both
λmax and dmin. The above example shows the validity of the conjecture, and the code matrix
with (c0,1 ⊕ c1,1) = (c0,2 ⊕ c1,2) = 1 does minimize the error bound (1− λ2max)dmin/2.
A better criterion than (1−λ2max)dmin/2 especially for a non-identical sensor network in which
some sensors or some hypotheses have much larger qi,j than the others is the upper probability
bound in (5). A simple calculation shows that the number of exclusive-OR, multiplication and
addition operations required to determine (5) for a selected code matrix C is of the order
O(NM2).2 However, the required operations for the determination of {Di}M−1i=0 that are necessary

2The calculation of each qi,j given in (4) needs M exclusive-OR operations, M + 1 multiplications and M additions, and
there are NM of qi,j’s to determine. Hence, this step requires O(NM2) operations. It can be shown that with the availability
of {qi,j}0≤i≤M−1,1≤j≤N , the computation of (5) requires the same order of operations.

2. For the previously assigned {h(j)`|i }0≤`,i≤M−1,1≤j≤N , find by simulated annealing algo-
rithm the DCFECC code that minimizes (5) subject to the constraint of (12) for a
target fault-tolerance capability |F| (or equivalently, a target sensor fault ratio defined
as |F|/N ).
A final note in this section is that according to Lemma 3, the computational complexity of
criterion (5) can be greatly reduced if the code search is applied to the simpler identical sensor
system, where the quantities involved in computations are only the pair-wise Hamming distances.
五、 結果與討論
In this section, we examine the performance and fault-tolerance capability of the DCFECC
codes that are constructed through the code search algorithm of the previous section.
Identical Sensor System
Assume that each communication link employs antipodal transmission over an AWGN channel;
hence, ²j = ² = 12erfc(
√
γs) for 1 ≤ j ≤ N , where erfc(·) is the complementary error function,
and γs is the signal-to-noise ratio of the communication link. In addition, each local observation
yj is assumed to be Gaussian distributed with mean ` and variance 1/γo given that hypothesis
H` is true, where the signal-to-noise ratio for sensor observations, i.e., γo, is the square of the
minimum difference in these Gaussian means, divided by the common observation variance. In
this case, the code search criterion of (5) is reduced to (9).
Take N = 20 and M = 8. We first search for the DCFECC code that minimizes the minimum
Hamming distance fusion error defined in (15), and compare it with the best code that minimizes
(9) without the minimum dmin constraint. It needs to be pointed out that the best codes that
respectively minimize (9) and (15) may be different for different target signal-to-noise ratios.4
4One can observe from Fig. 4 that the three 8 × 20 codes obtained for different target signal-to-noise ratios have different
performances. Their (λmax, dmin) are (−0.640353, 7), (−0.523694, 10), and (−0.57259, 7) respectively for target signal-to-
noise ratios (γs, γo) = (∞, 6 dB), (0 dB,∞) and (0 dB, 6 dB). As anticipated, the code obtained at target (γs, γo) =
(0 dB,∞ dB) performs the best at high γo since its target signal-to-noise ratios are closest to the operational ones at this range,
i.e., γs = 0 dB and γo ≥ 8 dB. Additionally, the code for target (γs, γo) = (0 dB, 6 dB) performs only slightly better than
the code for target (γs, γo) = (∞ dB, 6 dB), and both of them outperform the third code at low γo. From this figure, we can
infer that the deviation of the target γo from the operational ones affects the resultant performance more than that of γs.

are respectively −0.548644 and 185. These two values, as expected, satisfy the minimum dmin
constraint with 10% sensor fault ratio, i.e.,
dmin = 185 > −2|1− 2²| |F|
λmax
= −2|1− 2× 0.07865| 600× 10%
(−0.548644) = 184.316.
The simulation results and performance bounds for this code are summarized in Figs. 6 and 7.
Note that it is infeasible to perform the code search for minimum fusion error criterion defined
in (15) for such a large sensor network.
From Fig. 6, we observe again that bound (3) is almost identical to bound (9), and is about
1.5 dB better than bound (10) at Pe = 10−5. This indicates that it is not beneficial in terms of
performance to replace the code search criterion (9) by the more complex (3), and adopting the
simpler (10) as a new code search criterion may result in a code with degraded performance.
Secondly, the simulated performance for the searched code with 10% stuck-at-one sensor fault
ratio almost follows the curve of its search criterion (9) as we have anticipated, and is only 0.5
dB inferior to its performance without sensor faults at Pe = 10−5. Also illustrated in this figure
is that another 0.75 dB performance degradation will occur if the stuck-at-one sensor fault ratio

stuck-at-one.
Non-identical Sensor System
In this simulation, the sensors are divided into three equal groups. Each sensor group forms
an identical sensor subsystem as in the previous subsection. The signal-to-noise ratios for the
three groups are respectively (γo/2, 2 × γs), (γo, γs) and (2 × γo, γs/2). In other words, some
sensors have more accurate local classification but poor communication links, while some other
sensors may be short in local classification accuracy but have less noisy communication links. A
potential scenario for the above system configuration is that a group of sensors is closer to the
target but farther from the fusion center, and another group of sensors is located distant from the
target but is near the fusion center. Again, the code search is performed under γo = 6 dB and
γs = 0 dB, and the target sensor fault ratio allowable is 10%. The λmax and dmin of the obtained

this code are summarized in Figs. 9 and 10, and similar conclusions can be drawn as those for
the identical sensor system. As a summary, in both figures, bound (5) coincides with bound (3),
and the performance of the code found with the target sensor fault ratio follows the curve of

at large γs in Fig. 10. In addition, the ultimate floor values of bound (6) are 1.25 × 10−49,
4.94× 10−22, 4.42× 10−52 and 1.08× 10−29 for Figs. 6, 7, 9 and 10, respectively. Since these
floor values indeed imply extremely small error performances that are of very minor interest in
practice, we simply neglect the illustration of them in these figures.
We end this subsection by pointing out that similar observations can be made when the
difference between the best and the worst sensors is further increased. As an example, by setting
the signal-to-noise ratios respectively for the three groups as (γo/4, 4 × γs), (γo, γs) and (4 ×
γo, γs/4), searching the code under γo = 8 dB and γs = 0 dB subject to 10% sensor fault ratio
yields Figs. 11 and 12. The λmax and dmin of the obtained code are respectively −0.517076 and
271. It can then be observed from the two figures that the results due to a larger difference in
signal-to-noise ratios between the best and the worst sensors are actually very similar to those
limited to 6 dB difference.

hypotheses. Recall that the code rate of an M × N code matrix is conventionally defined as
R = (1/N) log2(M). Thus, the code rates of the DCFECC codes simulated previously are
prohibitively small when they are compared with the code rates of the traditional error-correcting
codes. Since the traditional error-correcting codes with larger code rates (or equivalently, larger
M ) can still yield a good dmin (e.g., there exists rate-(8/127) BCH code with dmin = 63 [15,
pp. 438]), it is not surprising to obtain that at N = 100, the fusion error only mildly increases
with respect to M when M ≤ 120. Even with a scale of exponentially increasing M up to 29,
the growth rate of the fusion errors only sightly increases. It can be observed from Table II that
the dmin of the best codes that minimize (9) does not tend to decrease in M for M ≤ 120 (as
it should do for very large M ). Again, λmax remains almost constant for all M , and has the
average around −0.56. This result indicates that the number of hypotheses for the DCFECC
codes can actually be of an exponential order in the number of sensors (specifically, M = 2RN ).

and the second channel is the memoryless BSC channel. The case of sensor faults under the
equivalent channel model becomes that of u∗j turning independent of cj (and hence, code-
independent) without notifying the fusion center. Our results then indicate that the constraint
that the number of code-independent bits in u∗ (i.e., the number of faulty sensors) is less than
|βmax|×(dmin/2) is sufficient to guarantee a vanishing decoding error for such a serially connected
binary channel. This bound is derived based on the pessimistic view when both indices of faulty
sensors and sensor fault types are unknown to the fusion center, or equivalently, the decoder is
aware of neither the index of every faulty bit u∗j nor its resultant code-independent distribution.
In the extreme case that u∗ and c are completely dependent, which should occur when h(j)k|i = 1
for every 0 ≤ k = i ≤M−1, the constraint reduces to the conventional |F| < dmin/2 for coding
techniques since βmax = −1 as we have anticipated. This observation hints that in a channel
suffering from code-dependent noises, a code that makes u∗ (channel output) and c (channel

七、 計畫成果自評
On the first part of this project, we have analytically characterized the performance of the
DCFECC approach in both fault-free and faulty situations. Specifically, upper bounds on the
probability of error that are valid for any finite number of sensors have been derived based on
large deviations technique. We have also established a necessary and sufficient condition under
which the minimum Hamming distance fusion error vanishes as the number of sensors tends
to infinity. Additionally, we have also characterized the fault-tolerance capability of a DCFECC
approach given an employed DCFECC code. As anticipated, our results show the strong relation
between the fault-tolerance capability and the pair-wise Hamming distances of a DCFECC code.
