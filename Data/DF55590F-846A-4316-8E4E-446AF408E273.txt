中文摘要：
限制氧化鋅(ZnO)於藍光應用的障礙有二，其一是它沒有一個晶格常數與氧化鋅相同而
又容易製造的磊晶基板，因此無內應力之磊晶不易施行；其二是 p 型半導體的摻雜，因氧
化鋅自體缺陷為 n 型，故 p 型氧化鋅不易形成。尤其是以有機金屬化學氣相沉積法這種接
近熱力平衡條件的製程更是相對的困難。這二困難必須先獲得解決，氧化鋅方能發揮其他
面向之優點。本文中我們用 MgAl2O4 成功的沉積平坦的氧化鋅磊晶，並且一舉獲得 p 型
摻雜。我們發現 p 型摻雜的行為，隨著成長溫度的降低與成長速率的增加而強化，並推測
其造成 p 型之原因與碳原子之摻雜有關。我們同時以實驗展示了基板表面酸蝕處理對氧化
鋅磊晶之影響，也證明使用 MgAl2O4 確實是達成高品質氧化鋅磊晶形貌的可行辦法。我們
以有機金屬化學氣相沉積法的製程解決雙重問題，達成一般認為無法達成的目標。

Abstract
There are two major problems that hamper the application of ZnO as a blue light
optoelectronic material. How to grow strain-free, flat ZnO film with lattice mismatched substrate
is not easily achievable. The p-type formation of ZnO film is also considered difficult since the
intrinsic defect in ZnO tends to behave as n-type. These two obstacles must be overcome.
We have achieved significant progress on surface flatness and p-type doping of ZnO using
MgAl2O4 as substrate. We found that the p-type formation variation with temperature and growth
rate, and postulate that the carbon is the reason for the p-type behavior. We also succeeded on
surface modification of the substrate by etching to achieve flat ZnO films. We also confirm that
using MgAl2O4 as substrate is an adequate approach toward quality ZnO epitaxial film formation.
Most important of all, we overcome these two obstacles using MOCVD as the process tool,
which is considered very difficult.
Keywords: MOCVD, ZnO, epitaxy, MgAl2O4, p-type
The growth was performed using O2 and dimethylzinc (DMZn) as the precursors for O and Zn,
respectively. The O2 and DMZn were mixed in and flow out of the showerhead nozzle with
diameter of 100 mm. The chamber pressure was kept at 200 torr.
Conventional SEM and field emission SEM were used to observe the microstructure of the
deposit, and the -2scan of x-ray diffraction was used to determine the plane and growth
direction of the grown ZnO.
Result and discussion (結果與討論)
1. The sweet spot for planar ZnO epitaxy on sapphire and MgAl2O4
1.1 ZnO epitaxy on sapphire
Previous experiment shows that there is a narrow growth window of growth rate for ZnO planar
epitaxy. The film morphologies with different deposition rates are shown in Fig. 1. For the DMZn
flow rate at around 0.14 sccm, the planar epitaxial film appears. With further growth rate increase,
the film thickness surpasses its critical thickness and a stress relaxation seems to occur which
induces nucleation of small grains on top of the originally formed, large grained epitaxial film.
The film was grown at 300oC. Experiment also suggest (not shown) that as the substrate
temperature increases the growth rate sweet spot for planar epitaxy shift toward higher value.
1.2 ZnO epitaxy on MgAl2O4
The study of ZnO film morphology grown on MgAl2O4 is presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) and (b)
are ZnO grown on sapphire and MgAl2O4 substrates, respectively. Comparison between (a) and

plane step height of (111) MgAl2O4 of 0.47 nm.[2] Thus the roughness may coming from the
surface reconstruction of (111) MgAl2O4 at the very beginning of the ZnO deposition.
2. Doping of ZnO
2.1 Growth at 300oC
The doping concentration, doping type and carrier mobility of ZnO epitaxial film are listed in
Table 1. Sample 1, 2, and 3 were grown at 300oC while sample 4 was grown at 320oC. For the
samples grown at 300oC, as DMZn flow rate increases from 0.14 to 0.19, the doping type is
reversed from n to p type; and as the DMZn flow rate further increases, the p type carrier
concentration increases from 1.41016 cm-1 to 9.01018 cm-1, accordingly. It concludes that as
DMZn flow rate increases, the p-type behavior is strengthened. The sample for DMZn flow rate
equal to 0.28 sccm was not measured, and was not listed because the development of cracks
causing the chipping off of ZnO film from the MgAl2O4 substrate, which cause the measurement
impossible.

epitaxy. Using TMGa (trimethylgalium) has enhanced carbon doping than that using TEGa
(tyiethylgalium).[5,6]
2.4 Interface phases
No extra interface phases were found other than ZnO and MgAl2O4 from the WDS elemental
mapping as analyzed mentioned above. Thus the use of MgAl2O4 for ZnO epitaxy is adequate at
growth temperature of 350oC.
3. Effect of acid etching of substrates
Fig. 5 shows the ZnO film grown on substrates subjected to different pretreatment conditions. For
sample without pre-etching of the substrate, the ZnO film forms granular structure with grain size
about 1m. For substrate pre-etched with H2SO4, the ZnO film also forms granular structure with
grain size slightly less than 1m. For substrate pre-etched with H3PO4, the ZnO film exhibit very
flat surface but with some straight lines resembling dislocations. The flat surface with straight
lines indicates quality epitaxial growth but with lattice mismatch relaxation as film thickens. This
feature represents that the lattice strain was not relaxed at the early stage of film growth. On the
other hand, the granular structure represents that threading dislocation formed at the
substrate/film interface and grows along with grains. Apparently, by etching substrate with H3PO4,
the ZnO can grow on top of MgAl2O4 with less strain at 320oC. There must be some self-aligned
features on top of the MgAl2O4 that closely resemble the periodicity of ZnO after H3PO4
treatment of MgAl2O4 substrate. Further research will be taken to do the surface study of the
etched substrate surface. Nevertheless, the flat surface of epitaxial growth is a breakthrough of

breakthrough that can be used for ZnO as blue and white LED applications. The ZnO has high
exciton binding energy than GaN, and is long considered as superior material for the blue light
source. We also demonstrate that p-type epitaxial film can be prepared by MOCVD process,
which is considered almost impossible before. By solving flat film and p-type formation, the
barrier for ZnO on blue light application can be overcame. We are one of the few research teams
that can achieve these goals using MOCVD for successful ZnO epitaxial growth that leads to blue
light LED applications. We are proud to say that we excel in the field of ZnO epitaxy, world
class.
