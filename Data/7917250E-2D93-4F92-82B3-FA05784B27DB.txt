the alloy in bulk form. Recently, nanocrystalline structure of Al–Fe
alloy was produced by imposing severe plastic deformation (SPD)
to ingot [20]. The SPD technique used was torsion under high
pressure, which can produce material only with limited size.
Our previous work had shown that aluminum reinforced with
large amount (up tow50 vol.%) of nanometer-sized Al3Ti particles
could be fabricated in situ from Al–Ti elemental powder mixtures
via FSP [12]. This technique combines the hot working nature of FSP
and the exothermic reaction between aluminum and transition
metals. The FSP can provide the following functions in one-step: (a)
severe plastic deformation to promote mixing and reﬁning of
constituent phases in the material, (b) hot consolidation to form
fully dense solid. The objective of the present study is to produce
ultraﬁne-grained aluminum reinforced by large amount of nano-
meter-sized Al–Fe intermetallic compound. The intermetallic
particles are formed in-situ and uniformly dispersed in the
aluminum matrix during FSP.
2. Experimental procedure
In this work, powder mixture of Al–10 at.%Fe (denoted as Al–
10Fe) was prepared from pure aluminum powder (99.7% purity,
325mesh) and pure iron powder (99.5% purity,325mesh). After
proper mixing, the Al–10Fe powders were cold compacted to
a small billet (1212 88 mm) in a steel die set by using
a pressure of 225 MPa. To improve the billet strength for easier
handling in FSP, the green compact was sintered in Ar atmosphere
at 823 K for 20 min. The tool pin used in FSP was standard M1.2*6
(diameter of 6 mm and pitch height of 1.2 mm). The tool spindle
angle (angle between spindle and workpiece normal) was 3. A
counterclockwise tool rotation speed of 1400 rpm was used. The
rotating tool was traversed at 45 mm/min along the long axis of the
billet. For multiple FSP passes, the rotating tool was moved along
the same line for each FSP pass, and it was applied after the
workpiece had been cooled down from the previous FSP pass.
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Ka, 40 kV, 30 mA) was utilized to
identify the phases present in the specimens. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, JSM-6330) was used to study the distribution of
second phase particles. Thin foils for transmission electron

amount of Fe after FSP could not be determined from the X-ray
diffraction patterns. The amount of Al13Fe4 increased with
increasing FSP passes.
The cross-section of the stirred zone in specimens produced by
FSP was examined by the use of SEM. Three phases, each differing
in contrast, can be characterized in the BEI images (Fig. 2). By using
EDS analysis, the brightest phase is identiﬁed as Fe, the dark gray
matrix is Al, and the light gray phase, which surround Fe particle or
dispersed in the Al matrix, is Al–Fe compound. Agglomeration of
small particles of Al–Fe compound was observed after 2 FSP passes
(Fig. 2b). Increasing the passes of FSP, the Fe-containing particles
are reﬁned and more uniformly distributed in the Al matrix (Fig. 2).
It is also noted that the reaction between Al and Fe is not complete
even after 4 FSP passes (Fig. 2c), because iron particles still exist in
the stirred zone. By using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), the
reaction zone surrounding iron particle in the stirred zone (SZ) of
a specimen is determined to have a composition close to Al13Fe4.
The minor amount of Al5Fe2, as indicated by XRD analysis, was
believed to present between Fe and Al13Fe4. Because of the ﬁne
scale of the reaction zone and the resolution limit of electron probe,
EPMA only indicated a continuous variation of Al and Fe across the
interface, and the location of Al5Fe2 could not be positively
identiﬁed.
From the literature [21], the main intermetallic compound
formed in Al–Fe system is Al5Fe2 in the solid state reaction. In
addition, there are several studies on the microstructural analysis
of the interface layer when molten aluminum comes in contact
with solid iron [22,23]. The microstructure of solid iron and molten
aluminum couple was examined at the interface to identify the
phases as Al5Fe2 and Al13Fe4. In a recent report [24], Lee et al. used
plasma synthesis method (PSM) to manufacture in-situ Al–Fe
composites. They suggested that the ﬁrst phase nucleated on the
interfacial layer of Al/Fe was Al13Fe4. By the reaction between
Al13Fe4 and Fe, the Al5Fe2 phase formed and grew inward. The fact
that Al5Fe2 did not exist abundant in our FSP specimens might be
due to that the low temperature and short reaction time in FSP,
which limited the growth of Al5Fe2.
The microstructure of the SZ in specimens produced by FSP was
also examined by the use of TEM. Typical microstructures are
shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, there are ﬁne second phase
particles uniformly distributed in the aluminum matrix. In addi-
tion, dark ﬁeld image was used to determine the grain size of
aluminum, which had an average value about 1 mm. A typical
example is given in Fig. 3b. The ultraﬁne grains of Al matrix are
resulted from the large plastic strain introduced in FSP. Addition-
ally, the presence of ﬁnely dispersed second phase particles can
limit the grain growth; therefore, the ﬁne grains can be maintained
through multiple FSP passage.
In general, the second phase particles have elliptical shape as
shown in Fig. 4a. The average size of the particle is about 100–
200 nm long and 50–100 nm wide. By using selection area
diffraction (SAD) patterns, the second phase particle was identiﬁed
as monoclinic Al13Fe4. The SAD pattern of the [130] zone axis of an
Al13Fe4 particle is shown in Fig. 4b. The Al13Fe4 particles often
contain numerous ﬁne contrast bands. As shown in Fig. 4c,
diffraction spots associated with Al13Fe4 particles are streaked
along the (001) direction in reciprocal space. Streaking of this type

Abstract
Friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to produce fine dispersion of Al-Mo
intermetallic particles in aluminum. In this process, the hot working nature of FSP
could effectively promote the exothermic reaction between Al and Mo and produce
fine Al-Mo intermetallic particles with an average size of ~200 nm. The Al-Mo
intermetallic particles formed during FSP were identified mainly as Al12Mo with
minor amount of Al5Mo. From the study of post-FSP heat treatment at 873 K, one
could find that the Al5Mo phase was formed between Mo and Al12Mo. The Al-Mo
reaction in heat treatment without the help of concurrent shear deformation was rather
slow, because it is controlled by the interdiffusion through Al12Mo phase. It is
suggested that the critical mechanism responsible for the rapid reaction and the
formation of nanometer sized particles in FSP is the effective removal of the Al12Mo
phase from the Al-Mo interface by the severe strain imposed in FSP.

3microstructural modification based on the principle of friction stir welding (FSW). In
FSP, a rotating tool, with pin and shoulder, is inserted and moved along the material
providing localized heating and plastic deformation. The material experiences very
largeplastic strain (εeff > 40) by being extruded around the rotating tool [14]. A
comprehensive literature review on friction stir welding has been given by Mishra and
Ma [15], and a review on the recent developments in FSP was provided by Ma [16].
Our previous study showed that an Al-Mo alloy with fine dispersion of
nanometer sized Al12Mo particles (~200nm) could be successfully produced by using
FSP, which exhibited enhanced modulus (78 GPa), high tensile strength (177 MPa)
and good ductility (16.5%) [17]. In this paper, detailed microstructure studies on the
formation of Al-Mo intermetallics during FSP will be presented.
Experimental
Powder mixtures of Al-3 at.% Mo, Al-5 at.% Mo, and Al-10 at.% Mo, which
will be denoted as Al-3Mo, Al-5Mo and Al-10Mo, respectively, were prepared from
pure aluminum powder (99.7% purity, -325 mesh) and pure molybdenum powder
(99.99% purity, 4m). After proper mixing, the Al–Mo powder mixture was cold
compacted to a billet of 12×12×88 mm3 in a steel die set by using a pressure of 225
MPa. To improve the billet strength for easier handling during FSP, the green
compact was sintered in Ar at 823 K for 20 min. The tool pin used in FSP was the
standard M1.2*6 (diameter of 6 mm and pitch height of 1.2 mm). The tool spindle
angle (angle between spindle and workpiece normal) was 3o. The rotating tool was
traversed along the long axis of the billet. Based on trial studies, a tool-rotation speed
of 1400 rpm, traverse speed of 30-45 mm/min, and four FSP passes were applied to
give defect free specimens consistently. For multiple FSP passes, the rotating tool was
moved along the same line for each pass and was applied after the specimen had
5200 nm are well dispersed in aluminum matrix. Because of the high volume fraction
of the intermetallics formed in Al-10Mo, many of the particles coalesced to form
larger size particles. The microhardness of the FSP specimens, which were processed
with tool traverse speed of 45mm/min, is shown as a function of Mo content in Fig. 3.
The hardness of Al-10Mo reaches 1.5GPa.
Since the three alloys have similar microstructural characteristics, only the
results of Al-5Mo alloy will be presented in the following text. Figure 4 shows the
typical microstructure of FSP specimen revealed by TEM. Similar to that in SEM,
there is large number of fine particles uniformly distributed in the aluminum matrix.
The average size of the aluminum grains, as revealed by the dark field image, is about
2m (Fig. 4b). The second phase particles were identified as Al12Mo, which have an
equiaxed shape and an average size about 200 nm (Fig. 4c). Based on the
microstructural observation, the Al-Mo reaction in FSP may be summarized as
follows. The Al12Mo is the first reaction product formed at the Al/Mo interface, which
forms a rim enclosing the Mo particle (Fig. 4d). Both EDX and SAD analysis were
used to confirm the intermetallic phase surrounding Mo is Al12Mo. In FSP, the
Al12Mo particles formed could be removed from the Al/Mo interface and dispersed
into the Al matrix by the severe shear strain provided by FSP. Then, intimate contact
between Mo and Al can be maintained and the reaction can proceed without
hindrance.
During FSP, the time that the material is subjected to the thermomechanical
action, the“processing time”, is very short, i.e., only on the order of tens of seconds,
depending on the tool traverse speed and tool geometry. In this work, the processing
time is about 20 sec with tool traversing at 45 mm/min. If the tool traverse speed
reduces to 30 mm/min, the processing time would increase to about 30 sec. According
to the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 5, one can find that lower tool traverse speed (30
7formation of fine intermetallic particles in Al is the concurrent action of high
temperature and severe plastic deformation. With tool traverse speed of 45 mm/min,
the total“processing time”of 4 FSP passes is only about 80 sec. The rapid reaction
might be attributed to the following mechanisms.
1. The severe shear strain provided by FSP can shear the metal powders and break
the oxide film on the powder surface, which will cause direct contact between Al
and Mo and promote the reaction.
2. In FSP, the processing temperature is determined by the tool rotating rate and
traverse speed [15]. As the processing temperature increases above the“threshold
temperature”, the exothermic Al-Mo reaction starts. The heat release associated
with the reaction will further raise the temperature and enhance the reaction. Due
to the exothermic heat release, local melting of Al is possible, which may
accelerate the reaction with Mo.
3. As observed in the specimen experiencing post-FSP heat treatment, the reaction
between Mo and Al proceeds slowly even at 873 K, because the Al12Mo phase
enclosing Mo becomes a barrier and the reaction is controlled by the interdiffusion
of Al and Mo through it. In FSP, however, the reaction products can be removed
from the Al/Mo interface and dispersed into the Al matrix due to the severe shear
strain, and consequently, the reaction can precede effectively at the interface.
After leaving the Al/Mo interface, the growth of the dispersed intermetallic
particles will be controlled by lattice diffusion through the Al matrix, and
therefore the particle size is limited in such short processing time.
4. Summary
Friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to produce fine dispersion of Al-Mo
intermetallic particles in aluminum. This process has combined the hot working

1. Introduction
Friction stir processing (FSP) for microstructural modification of materials was
developed based on the principle of friction stir welding (FSW) [1]. Mishra and Ma have a
comprehensive literature review on FSW and FSP [2]. The tool used in FSW comprises a
shoulder and a pin. A friction stir weld is produced by inserting a non-consumable rotating
tool into the workpiece until the tool shoulder is in intimate contact with the work surface.
The shoulder compresses the surface of the workpiece and contains the plasticized region.
Heat is generated on the surface by friction between the rotating shoulder and the workpiece
surface. As the tool translates along the joint line, plasticized material is stirred and forged
behind the trailing face of the pin, where it consolidates and cools down to form the
solid-state weld [2]. It has been shown that the material has experienced very large plastic
strain (εeff > 40) by being extruded around the rotating tool [3]. A variety of effective FSP
applications have been shown: (a) to produce ultrafine-grained structure [4-7], (c) to refine the
microstructure of cast aluminum alloys [8-10], (d) to form a surface composite on an
aluminum substrate [11], (f) to form in situ metal matrix composite [12-15], etc. In a recent
review article [16], Ma addressed the current state of understanding and development of FSP.
It is widely recognized that the mechanical properties of metal matrix composites
(MMCs) are controlled by the size and volume fraction of the reinforcements as well as the
nature of the matrix-reinforcement interface [17]. Superior mechanical properties can be
achieved, when fine and stable reinforcements with good interfacial bonding are dispersed
uniformly in the matrix. In general, the reinforcing particles used in MMCs are formed prior
to addition to the matrix metal. In this case, the scale of reinforcing phase is limited by the
starting particle size. Normally, the size of reinforcement particles is much larger than 1m
and they are located intergranularly in the metal matrix. Therefore, they cannot contribute to
the strength by the Orowan mechanism. However, for composites with large amount of
nanometer size particles, which are distributed both intragranularly and intergranularly, the
interparticle spacing could be reduced to the order of 100 nm or less, and consequently, the
matrix grain size is possible to be limited to the submicrometer range due to Zener pinning
effect [18]. Then, singificant contributions due to both Orowan strengthening and grain size
strengthening could be realized.
Recent research works [12-14] have shown that in situ aluminum matrix composites can
be fabricated by FSP without further consolidation process. The basic idea for fabricating the
in situ composites is to combine the hot working nature of FSP and the exothermic reaction
between aluminum and transition metals. Aluminum matrix composites reinforced with
nanometer sized intermetallic particles have been successfully produced from elemental
powder mixtures of Al-Cu, Al-Ti, and Al-Fe [12-14].
Thermite reactions can occur between aluminum and an oxide of a less reactive metal,
and stable Al2O3 will be formed. Consequently, aluminum matrix composites reinforced by
Al2O3 particles can be produced by oxide-aluminum displacement reaction. The objective of
3. Results and Discussion
For the Al-Fe2O3 system, the major second phases produced by FSP areγ-Al2O3 and
Al13Fe4 as indicated in the XRD patterns (Fig.1). For the Al-2Fe2O3 system, Fe2O3 is reacted
fully with Al to form Al13Fe4 and Al2O3, but in Al-4Fe2O3 system some Fe2O3 remains
unreacted after four FSP passes as indicated by the XRD pattern (Fig.1). Based on the XRD
results, the main chemical reaction between Al and Fe2O3 may consist of two parts:
2 Al ＋ Fe2O3 ＝ 2 Fe ＋ Al2O3 +H1 (1)
13 Al + 4 Fe = Al13Fe4 +H2 (2)
Both reactions are exothermic, i.e.,H1 = -851 kJ, andH2 = -476 kJ [28].
The typical microstructure of Al-Fe2O3 after 4 FSP passes is shown in Fig. 2. The
micrograph reveals a homogeneous distribution of the nanometer sized particles (in the order
of ~100 nm) in the aluminum matrix. The uniformly distribution of reinforcement particles
can be attributed to suitable blending parameters and the high shear strain used in friction stir
processing. The microstructure was further examined by the use of TEM as shown in Figs.
3-6. In general, there are two types of particles in morphology. Particles of ~200 nm in size
and mostly with elliptical shape were identified as Al13Fe4. In addition, there are fine particles
(about 10 nm), which were identified asγ-Al2O3. The majority of Al2O3 particles are present
in the form of clusters with diameter about 100-200 nm. The size of both Al13Fe4 particles and
Al2O3 clusters in Al-4Fe2O3 is larger than those in Al-2Fe2O3, which may be due to larger heat
released in the Al-4Fe2O3 system.
The average hardness in the stirred zone of Al-2Fe2O3increases from 40 Hv in the
as-sintered state to 105 Hv after four FSP passes. Such a considerable increase in the
microhardness may be attributed to the grain size refinement in Al matrix and the formation
of fine second phase particles uniformly distributed in aluminum matrix. The distribution of
fine particles within the grain interior of aluminum matrix can contribute significantly to the
strength by the Orowan mechanism. The average hardness in the stirred zone increases with
increasing the content of Fe2O3, which from 105 Hv in the Al-2Fe2O3 alloy to 144 Hv in
Al-4Fe2O3 alloy after four FSP passes. The tensile properties are summarized in Table 1. It
shows that a combination of high strength and good tensile elongation can be realized in FS
processed Al-Fe2O3 system. As compared to Al-2Fe2O3, Al-4Fe2O3 possesses higher strength
and modulus but inferior tensile elongation, which may be attributed to the presence of large
amount of second phase (~39%) in the composite.The Young’s modulus of FSP Al-Fe2O3
specimen is significantly higher than that of aluminum (70 GPa), i.e., 88 GPa and 97 GPa for
Al-2Fe2O3, and Al-4Fe2O3, respectively. The significant improvement in modulus can be
attributed to the presence of large amount of Al2O3 and Al13Fe4 in the composite.The Young’s 
modulus of Al2O3 and Al13Fe4 are 380 GPa and 130 GPa, respectively. It is believed that the
higher strength of Al-4Fe2O3 as compared to Al-10Fe alloy is due to the presence of fine
Al2O3 particles in it.
in Al-SiO2 reaction than in Al-Fe2O3 reaction. After 4 FSP passes, SiO2 in the sintered billet
was partially reacted with Al, and the extent of reaction increases with decreasing of tool
traversing speed in FSP. The Al2O3 formed in Al-SiO2 system could be identified as-Al2O3.
Similar to the Al-Fe2O3 system, the Al2O3 particles of nanometer size are often present in the
form of cluster with a size about 50 nm. Post-FSP heat treatment was applied to enhance the
reaction. After heat treated at 873 K for 1 h, the reaction between SiO2 and Al is completed,
and the microhardness can reach 110 Hv.

Reaction%
Thermite reactions can occur between aluminum and
an oxide of a less reactive metal, and stable Al2O3 will be
formed. Consequently, aluminum matrix composites
reinforced by Al2O3 particles can be produced by oxide-
aluminum displacement reaction. The Al-Al2O3 in-situ
composites have been produced in many Al-oxide sys-
tems, such as Al-Fe2O3,
[24] Al-CuO,[25] andAl-SiO2.
[26] In
the present work, the idea of forming an in-situ composite
via FSP was applied to the Al-metal oxide (MO) system.
Because the heat release of the Al-MO reaction is much
higher than that of the Al-transition metal (Al-TM), a
higher temperature and an enhanced reaction rate are
expected from the Al-MO reaction. Because of the
stability of Al2O3 in aluminum, ﬁne Al2O3 particles are
expected from this process. In this work, CeO2 was
selected to react with Al to form the in-situ composite.
In addition to Al2O3, the Ce reduced from CeO2 will
also react with Al to form an intermetallic compound,
Al11Ce3. Because Ce has low diﬀusivity and solu-
bility in aluminum,[27] the Al11Ce3 compound is also
expected to have a low coarsening rate at an elevated
temperature.
The conventional pressing and sintering route was
used to form a precursor from a powder mixture of
constituents. The main purpose of sintering is to provide
enough strength to prevent fracture as the rotating tool
plunges into it during FSP. However, depending upon
the temperature, diﬀerent degrees of reaction may occur
during sintering.
In FSP, the major processing parameters are the tool
rotating rate and the tool traversing speed. The intense
plastic deformation around the tool and the friction
between the tool and the workpiece both contribute to
the temperature increase in the stirred zone (SZ). The
maximum temperature in the SZ during FSW of various
aluminum alloys was reported to be between 0.6 and
0.9 Tm.
[2] Generally, an increase in the ratio of the
rotation rate to the traversing speed will increase the
peak temperature in FSP. In the present case, the heat
release due to the in-situ chemical reaction in FSP can
also contribute to the temperature rise. In the present
study, the eﬀect of the sintering temperature and the
tool traversing speed on the microstructure and mechan-
ical properties of the composites was investigated.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
The starting materials used are pure aluminum
powder (99.7 pct purity, average size 40 lm) and pure
cerium oxide (CeO2) powder (99.9 pct purity, average
size 7 lm). Powder mixtures of Al-5 mol pct CeO2 were
ball milled for 1 hour in a water-cooled attritor at
150 rpm, in order to disperse the oxide particles uni-
formly. The weight ratio of the ball to the powder was
15:1. The ball-milled powders were cold compacted to a
billet of 12 9 12 9 88 mm3 in a steel die using a
pressure of 400 MPa. Before FSP, the green compact
was sintered in argon for 1 hour at temperatures ranging
from 813 to 883 K.
Based upon a preliminary study of this material, a
tool rotating speed of 500 rpm in FSP was found to give
defect-free specimens consistently. Lower tool rotating
speeds often produced specimens with insuﬃcient bond-
ing, while higher tool rotating speeds sometimes caused
excessive melting in the specimen. In the present work,
the tool rotating speed was set at 500 rpm and the
rotating tool was moved along the long axis of the billet
with the traversing speed varying from 30 to 120 mm/
min. For multiple FSP, the pin tool was moved along
the same line and the FSP pass was applied after the
workpiece had been cooled from the previous FSP pass.
The tool pin used in FSP was a standard M6, and the
tool spindle angle (the angle between the spindle and the
workpiece normal) was 3 deg. Four FSP passes were
applied not only to remove the porosity in the sintered
billet but also to enhance the reaction in the specimen.
The X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) method (Cu Ka, 40 kV,
30 mA) was used to identify the phases present in
the specimens. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
(JSM-6330) was used to study the distribution of
second-phase particles. Thin foils for transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) were prepared by ion
milling. Thin foils were examined using an analytical
electron microscope (JEOL* 3010) operated at 200 kV.
The mechanical properties of specimens machined from
the SZ were evaluated on an Instron 5582 (Instron
Corporation, Norwood, MA) universal testing machine
with an initial strain rate of 1 9 103 s1. The stress
direction was aligned along the traverse direction of the
FSP. Cylindrical specimens 4 mm in diameter and 6 mm
in length were used for compression tests. The gage
sections of the tensile specimens were 3 mm in diameter
and 14 mm in gage length. The Young’s modulus was
calculated by determining the slope of the straight-line
portion of the tensile stress-strain curve.
III. RESULTS
A. Microstructure after Sintering
Sintering was applied to the cold-compacted billet to
provide enough strength to prevent cracking in FSP. In
addition, a reaction between Al and CeO2 may occur
during sintering if the temperature is high enough to
initiate the reaction. The XRD patterns of the
as-sintered specimens with various sintering tempera-
tures are shown in Figure 1. There were only Al and
CeO2 in the cold-compacted billet, and the intensity of
the CeO2 peaks in the as-sintered specimen was reduced
as compared to the green compact. In addition, Al11Ce3
and d*-Al2O3 can be identiﬁed in the pattern of the as-
sintered specimen, indicating that a partial reaction
between the Al and CeO2 had occurred during sintering.
The microstructure of the sintered specimens was
revealed by an SEM secondary electron image (SEI),
and the typical microstructure is shown in Figure 2. It
indicates that partial reaction between Al and CeO2 had
occurred in local areas during the sintering. The

514—VOLUME 41A, FEBRUARY 2010 METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A
calculated by assuming a complete reaction between Al
and CeO2. However, a tool traversing speed of 120 mm/
min could not achieve a complete reaction in four FSP
passes for specimens sintered at 883 K. It is also noted
from Table I that with a tool traversing speed of 30 mm/
min, a complete reaction could be produced by four FSP
passes for specimens sintered at temperatures higher
than 833 K.
The size distribution of these Al11Ce3 particles result-
ing from diﬀerent tool traversing speeds is also shown in
Figure 4. It shows that a lower tool traversing speed
results in a ﬁner and more uniform particle size. Most of
the ﬁne (submicron-sized) particles were believed to be
the result of the in-situ reaction during FSP, while those
particles with a relatively larger size were formed from
fragmentation of the bulky Al11Ce3 particles formed
during sintering as a result of the severe deformation
imposed by FSP. It is suggested that a high traversing
speed has less stirring time to reﬁne these particles;
therefore, more coarse particles result.
The grain boundaries of the aluminum matrix can be
revealed by the use of ion etching, as shown in Figure 6.
The average grain size of aluminum matrix in all the
specimens is quite similar, approximately 390 to 550 nm,
as shown in Table I. In general, the specimen processed
by the highest sintering temperature and the lowest tool
traversing speed has the largest grain size as compared
with specimens prepared by other processing conditions,
while the one processed by sintering at 833 K and with a
tool traversing speed of 30 mm/min has the smallest
grain size.
The microstructure of the FSP specimen was further
examined by the use of TEM. The bright-ﬁeld image in
Figure 7(a) shows that nanometer-sized particles are
uniformly distributed in the Al matrix. These nanome-
ter-sized particles could be identiﬁed as d*-Al2O3
according to the diﬀraction rings observed in the
corresponding diﬀraction pattern, as shown in
Figure 7(b). Although Al2O3 has low mass absorption
with respect to electrons, part of the particles still could
be observed due to their diﬀraction contrast. A dark-
ﬁeld image taken from a small portion of the (440)
diﬀraction ring of d*-Al2O3, as shown in Figure 7(c),
can give an example of the distribution of the
nanometer-sized particles. The average size of these
nanometer-sized particles was determined to be
approximately 10 nm, similar to the diﬀerent process-
ing conditions studied.

tered at (b) 813 K, (c) 833 K, and (d) 883 K. Bulky bright phase (marked by C) in the sintered specimens is a Ce-containing compound, mainly
Al11Ce3, and the dark phase with a rounded appearance (marked by A) is an Al-rich phase resulted from eutectic melting and resolidiﬁcation.
516—VOLUME 41A, FEBRUARY 2010 METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A
particles are removed rapidly from the interface,
the growth of the particles is limited and nanome-
ter-sized particles result.
Both the FSP parameters and the exothermic reaction
will aﬀect the temperature in the sample. Basically, the
temperature resulting from the combination of tool
rotating and traversing speed must be high enough to
initiate the reaction and provide eﬀective consolidation
of the sintered billet. It should not be too high, however,
because high temperature will promote the exothermic
Al-CeO2 reaction, which may cause excessive melting in
the material. The presence of a signiﬁcant amount of
liquid in the material during FSP may result in large
cavities in the SZ. Another drawback of a higher FSP
temperature is that a coarser microstructure will be
produced.
B. Tensile-Compressive Strength Difference
The diﬀerence between the tensile and compressive
yield strength may be attributed to the presence of
Fig. 4—SEM SEIs showing the microstructure of FSP specimens processed by diﬀerent tool traversing speeds. Specimens were sintered at 883 K
and followed by four FSP passes. The FSP was performed with a tool rotating at 500 rpm and traversing at (a) 30 mm/min, (b) 85 mm/min, or
(c) 120 mm/min. (d) Specimen was sintered at 833 K and followed by four FSP passes with tool rotating at 500 rpm and traversing at 30 mm/
min. Histograms showing the size distribution of Al11Ce3 particles in each specimen are included. The D is the average particle size.

considerably. Therefore, this could not be the
major cause for the tension-compression strength
diﬀerence.
(b) The residual stress may result from the diﬀerence
in the coeﬃcient of thermal expansion (CTE)
between the aluminum matrix and the reinforcing
particles (Al11Ce3 and d
*-Al2O3 particles). The
CTE of these reinforcing phases is believed to be
lower than that of aluminum. When the composite
is cooled down from the processing temperature,
tensile residual stresses are expected in the alumi-
num matrix. This means that when the composite
is loaded, plastic flow occurs earlier in tension
than in compression. Thus, it is believed that the
strength difference between compressive and tensile
loading can be attributed to the residual stress
resulting from the differential contraction between
the Al and the reinforcing particles during the
cooldown in FSP.
C. Strengthening Mechanisms
The high strength of the composite can be attributed
to the ﬁne grain size of aluminum matrix as well as the
presence of a large amount of ﬁne reinforcing particles.
The contribution of the ﬁne grain size to the yield
strength can be estimated by the Hall–Petch equation
Drgs ¼ k=
ﬃﬃﬃ
d
p
, where d is the grain size and
k = 74 MPa lm1/2 for pure Al.[34] The average Al grain
size of the FSP specimen produced by various process-
ing conditions is in the range of 390 to 550 nm, and
therefore Drgs can be calculated as 100 to 118 MPa.

2. Experimental
The starting materials used are pure aluminum powder
(99.7% purity, average size 40 mm) and pure CeO2 powder
(99.9% purity, average size 7 mm). Powder mixtures of Al
and CeO2 were ball milled for 1 h in a water-cooled attritor at
150 rpm in order to disperse the oxide particles uniformly.
The ball to powder weight ratio is 15 : 1. The CeO2 content
of 1.25, 2.5 and 5mole pct was used, which will be denoted
as Al-1.25CeO2, Al-2.5CeO2, and Al-5CeO2, respectively.
The ball-milled powders were cold compacted to a billet of
12 12 88mm in a steel die set by using a pressure of
400MPa. Sintering was applied to the cold-compacted billet
to provide enough strength to prevent cracking in FSP. It was
found that both the sintering temperature and the tool
traversing speed in FSP have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
microstructure and mechanical properties of the compo-
site.14) Based upon previous study,14) the billet was sintered at
833K for 1 h in Ar atmosphere.
The tool for friction stir processing in this study has a
shoulder of 16mm dia. and a pin of 6mm in both dia. and
length. The tool pin used is standard M1.26 (Metrication,
with pitch height and diameter of 1.2mm and 6mm,
respectively). The material of the tool is made of SKH9 tool
steel. A 3.0 tool spindle angle (angle between spindle and
work piece normal) was used in FSP. Geometrically, it can
provide a height diﬀerence between the front and the rear
edge of the tool shoulder. As the material ﬂows to the back of
the rotating pin, it will experience a downward pressure and
porosities can be removed. Our experience indicates that
normally, at least two FSP passes are needed to eliminate the
porosities left in the sintered billet, but four passes would
consistently produce defect free material. Therefore, four FSP
passes were applied to the sintered billet in the present study.
In FSP, the major processing parameters are tool-rotating
rate, and tool traversing speed. Basically, the temperature
resulted from the combination of tool rotating and traversing
speed must be high enough to initiate the reaction and to
provide eﬀective consolidation of the sintered billet. But
it should not be too high, because high temperature will
promote the exothermic Al-CeO2 reaction that may cause
excessive melting in the material. The presence of signiﬁcant
amount of liquid in the material during FSP may result in
large cavities in the stir zone. Preliminary study on this
material showed that a tool-rotating speed of 500 rpm in FSP
could give defect free specimens consistently, while lower
tool-rotating speeds often produced specimen with insuﬃ-
cient bonding and higher tool-rotating speeds sometimes
caused excessive melting in the specimen. Detailed results of
the inﬂuence of sintering temperature and tool traversing
speed on the microstructure and mechanical properties of
this material can be found in Ref. 14). It showed that the
specimen produced by high tool traversing speed (120mm/
min) shows lower strength than those produced by lower tool
traversing speed (30 or 60mm/min). Based on the results of
Ref. 14), the FSP was performed with tool rotating at
500 rpm and traversing at 30mm/min in the present work.
Four FSP passes were applied not only to remove the porosity
in the sintered billet but also to enhance the reaction in the
specimen. For multiple FSP, the pin tool was moved along
the same line, and the FSP pass was applied after the billet
had been cooled down from the previous FSP pass.
X-ray diﬀraction (XRD, Cu K, 40 kV, 30mA) was
utilized to identify the phases present in the specimens.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL JSM-6330) was
used to study the distribution of second phase particles. Thin
foils for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were
prepared by ion-milling. Thin foils were examined by the use
of an analytical electron microscope (AEM) (JEOL 3010)
operated at 200 kV. Mechanical properties of specimens
machined from the stirred zone (SZ) were evaluated on an
Instron 5582 universal testing machine with an initial strain
rate of 1 103 s1. The stress direction was aligned along
the traverse direction of FSP. Cylindrical specimens with
dimensions of 4mm in diameter and 6mm in length were
used for compression tests. The dimensions of the gauge
section of tensile specimens were 3mm in diameter and
14mm in gauge length. Young’s modulus was calculated by
determining the slope of the straight line portion of the tensile
stress-strain curve.
3. Results and Discussion
The X-ray diﬀraction patterns (Fig. 1) indicate that after
sintering at 833K, there is partial reaction between CeO2 and
Al, and after 4 FSP passes, CeO2 had reacted completely with
Al to form Al11Ce3 and 
-Al2O3. -Al2O3 is one of the
transition phases of alumina. It has an orthorhombic structure
(a = 0.7934 nm, b = 0.7956 nm, c = 1.1711 nm),15) which
is close to the tetragonal  phase.16) The XRD peaks at
2 ¼ 17:6, 22.1, and 27.9 (Fig. 1) are the major evidence
to conﬁrm the presence of -Al2O3 phase, because these
three peaks could not be attributed to either  phase or

The high strength of the composite can be attributed to the
ﬁne grain size of aluminum matrix as well as the presence of
large amount of ﬁne reinforcing particles. The contribution of
ﬁne grain size to yield strength can be estimated by Hall-
Petch equation, gs ¼ kD1=2, where D is grain size, and
k ¼ 74MPa mm1=2 for pure Al.17) The average Al grain size
of the FSP specimen produced by various processing
conditions is in the range of 390–430 nm, and therefore
gs can be calculated as 113–118MPa. The majority of
Al11Ce3 particles have the size in the same order of
aluminum grains. Therefore, they are not supposed to interact
directly with intragranular dislocations, and cannot contrib-
ute to the strength via the Orowan bowing mechanism.
However, these particles may contribute to the strength by
load sharing. The major contributions to the high strength of
the composite are the Orowan strengthening caused by the
ﬁne and uniform dispersion of nano-size (10 nm) Al2O3
particles and the ultraﬁne-grained (UFG) structure (400
nm) of the aluminum matrix. The UFG structure of alumi-
num matrix is also a result of the ﬁne dispersion of Al2O3
nano-particles via the Zener pinning eﬀect.18) The micro-
structure within the gauge length of tensile tested specimen
was further examined by the use of TEM as shown in
Fig. 7, which shows dislocations pinned by ﬁne particles
in the aluminum matrix. This clearly demonstrates the
operation of Orowan strengthening mechanism in this
composite.
Al-5CeO2 specimens were used to examine the thermal
stability and high temperature strength of the composites.
FSP specimens were exposed at 823K or 873K for time
period from 1 h to 100 h and microhardness was measured at
room temperature. The hardness values of the composite after
thermal exposure are listed in Table 3, which shows slight
hardening after thermal exposure. The microstructure of Al-

4. Summary
In this study, friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to
produce aluminum based nano-composites from powder
mixtures of Al and CeO2. This technique has combined the
hot working nature of FSP and the exothermic reaction
between Al and CeO2. The composite produced possesses
both high modulus and high strength. The aluminum matrix
of the composite has ultraﬁne-grained structure with an
average size of 400 nm. The reinforcing phases were
identiﬁed as Al11Ce3 and 
-Al2O3. The Al2O3 particles with
an average size of 10 nm are uniformly distributed in the
aluminum matrix. The major contributions to high strength of
the composite are the ultraﬁne-grained structure of aluminum
matrix and the Orowan strengthening caused by the ﬁne
dispersion of nano-size Al2O3 particles inside aluminum
grains. The composite is very stable at elevated temperatures,
even after long time exposure at 873K. In addition, the
composite also exhibits high strength at elevated temper-
atures up to 773K.
