(MD) simulations. The ‘‘slip vector’’ parameter is used to study the collective motion of a group 
of atoms and the deformation behavior in three different directions (axial, radial, and tangential) 
of a (17, 0) carbon nanotube. The variations of radial slip vectors indicate almost all carbon atoms 
of the (17, 0) carbon nanotube will stay on the cylindrical surface before the yielding of the single 
wall carbon nanotube (SWNT). Furthermore, the tangential vectors show kinking deformation for 
the (17, 0) zigzag tube only rarely appears when the crack occurs. Non-symmetrical deformation 
around a carbon atom along the axial direction also can be found. The variations in the slip vector 
values of each atom display a symmetrical crack along the horizontal direction and normal to the 
tube axis. Chain-like structures with 3–4 atoms can be observed, with the number of chain-like 
structures decreasing before the breakage of the SWNT. The mechanical properties and dynamic 
behavior of a (17, 0) zigzag SWNT under tensile strain are also compared with that of a (10, 10) 
armchair tube in our previous study.

1.  Introduction   
One–dimensional nanotubes have attracted great interest in recent years because they have 
unique nanostructures with remarkable mechanical,1, 2 electronic3,4 and thermal5 properties that 
may have broad applications in different areas such as nano-electronics, optics, nano-devices, bio 
and medical appilications. In particular, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) have 
demonstrated potential to be used as a one-dimensional transport nanowire in novel electronic 
devices.6-7 SWNTs yield many unique mechanical properties including extremely high tensile 
strength and Young’s moduli of about 1 TPa. SWNTs were synthesized by Iijima’s group8 in 
1991 by using the arc-discharge evaporation method. Since then, various techniques, 9-11 
including the chemical vapor deposition method,9 catalytic pyrolysis of hydrocarbons,10 and 
condensed-phase electrolysis method11 also have been developed for fabricating SWNTs with 
well-defined structures. Three different types of SWNT structures have been 
confirmed—armchair, zigzag and chiral nanotubes—dependent on the different ways of rolling 
and chirality. A recent study has shown that applying strain to a one-dimensional material 
changes its electrical resistance since the strain alters the density of states (DOS) of the 
phonons.20 Theoretical calculations have also demonstrated that the lattice vibrations and 
electronic energies of nanotubes are highly sensitive to the magnitude of the applied strain.21,22 In 
our previous studies,23,24 we have found that the bond length and atomic arrangement of an Au 
nanowire will vary under different strains, leading to different lattice vibration types. Similarly, in 
the case of an SWNT under strain, the peaks of the DOS have a non-smooth dispersion since the 
DOS are highly sensitive to the diameter and bonding lengths of the nanowire and also to the 
structural assembly. Therefore, the structural arrangement and stretch condition have an absolute 
influence on the DOS spectrum, which in turn affects the electronic transmission behavior. 
However, different chirality and strain differently affect structural arrangement of six-membered 
rings of the tube and may influence its electronic properties.  
Since investigating the microstructure of a nanotube is difficult in experiment due to the 
very small scale involved, MD simulation is a powerful tool for the investigation of structural 
behavior at the atomic level. Adopting this technique, some fundamental studies have 
investigated the structural and mechanical behavior of carbon nanotubes.25-32 Belytschko et al.32 
examined the effect of the chirality on the fracture behavior of SWNTs under axial tensile tension 
using MD simulations. They found that different crack types were produced for armchair, zigzag 
and chiral SWNTs. For instance, the crack evolution for the armchair and zigzag nanotube 
oriented 45 degrees to the axis and parallel to the axis, respectively.  Furthermore, the crack 
evolution for the chiral form is similar to that of the armchair nanotube. Chenxin et al.25 
calculated the mechanical properties (Young’s modulus, tensile strength) under tensile loading, 
and analyzed the breaking behavior of the SWNT from the view of energy and strucutre. Song et 
al.29 showed that the tensile strain of carbon nanotubes with defects produce Stone-Wales 
transformations and differ in tensile strain from those in perfect nanotubes. Their results reveal 
that a Stone-Wales transformation occurs before carbon nanotube fracture.                                         
So far, to the best of our knowledge, the collective dynamic behavior of local carbon atoms of 
a carbon nanotube in different chirality under tension is not still well understand. In this study, in 
order to investigate the effect of chirality, we employ a useful parameter “slip vector”33 to study 
the collective dynamic behavior of carbon atoms of a (17,0) zigzag type by MD simulations of 
where im  is the mass of atom i ; 
m
iv  and 
n
iv   are the velocity components of atom i in the m- 
and n-directions, respectively; iV  is the volume assigned around atom i ; sN  is the number of 
particles contained within region S, where S is defined as the region of atomic interaction; )( ijrφ  
is the potential function; ijr  is the distance between atoms i  and j , and mijx  and nijx   are 
the m- and n-direction components of the vector from atom i to atom j .  
The first term on the right hand side of Eq. (2) describes the kinetic effect of the atomic 
motion and is dependent on the temperature. The second term expresses the effect of the 
interactive forces and is determined by the distance between the atoms. In Eq. (3), iV  is the 
Voronoi volume of atom i and is constructed by the perpendicular planes bisecting the lines 
between this atom and all of its neighboring atoms. Clearly, it is time-consuming to compute the 
Voronoi volume of each atom in the simulation system. Accordingly, Srolovitz et al. 39 proposed 
the following formulation to obtain a sphere whose volume is equal to the original Voronoi 
volume:

where )(tzl  is the average length of the SWNT in the axial direction following elongation and 
)(ozl  is the average initial length. The stress-strain relationship of the SWNT can then be obtained 
from Eqs. (2) and (4).  
Prior to elongation, the carbon nanotube is relaxed for 60 ps to eliminate any internal 
stresses. Following each further tensile strain, the carbon nanotube is relaxed for about 10 ps to 
Stretching the nanotubes, one can be found that the high characteristic frequency variation 
along with the strain, the peak will shift left as elastic strain increases during the elastic 
deformation stage. The elastic strain causes the atomic spaces to extend in the axial direction, 
which reduces the atomic bonding. This effect leads to a red shift enhancement as shown in Figs. 
5 and 6. 
 
The second year: 
Figures 7 and 8 show the water distribution inner and outer of the (5,5) and (10,10) armchair 
CNT with diameter d=0.69 Ǻ and d=13.6 Ǻ. For (5, 5) armchair CNT, the water molecular 
alignment forms a one-dimension wire shown in Fig. 7(a). The probability distribution of the 
oxygen and hydrogen atoms inner the CNT located at central part of the tube as shown in Fig. 
7(b), which is corresponding to the Fig. 7(a). Moreover, the hydrogen atoms are closer than 
oxygen atoms for the water molecules inside the CNT. The (10,10) nanotube forms another water 
ring around the central wire, which is shown in Fig.8(a). Corresponding to the snapshot of the 
water structure inside the (10,10) nanotube, the probability distribution of the oxygen or 
hydrogen atoms have two peaks, as shown in Fig. 8(b), for central and ring-type water molecule 
alignments. In this simulation, the density of water inside the (5,5) and (10,10) armchair CNT are 
0.2086 g/cm3  and 0.6906 g/cm3, respectively, which are less than external water density. Outer 
region of the CNT, the water molecules closed to wall of CNT are layered, which also can be 
found the probability distribution of the oxygen and hydrogen outside the nanotubes shown in 
Fig.7(b) and 8(b). 
    The CNTs under tensile loading process in water are simulated through molecular 
dynamics and shown in Fig. 9 and 10. The stress-strain relationship of CNT stretching in water, is 
similar to that testing in vacuum. The stretching process undergoes four stages, linear elastic 
stage, ductile yielding stage, strengthening stage and local deforming stage. It will find that the 
Young’s modulus is not change no matter the stretching process proceeding in water or vacuum. 
However, the maximum stress of the CNT in water is about 38% less than that in vacuum, and 
the period of ductile yielding stage is shorten under stretching process in water as shown in Fig. 9 
and 10. Owing to the nano-confinement effect, the density of water inner the nanotube is small 
and 0.2 within Stage 2, the stress increases relatively slightly with the strain until a stress level of 
481 GPa at a strain of about 0.2.  As the strain becomes larger than 0.25 within Stage 3, the 
stress displays a significant increase with the increase in strain before the occurrence of a sudden 
drop in the stress, where the maximal value becomes zero at a strain of about 0.255. From the 
initial strain of 0 to that at the sudden stress drop, the averaged radial slip vector is close to zero 
during the tension process, indicating almost all carbon atoms of (17,0) carbon nanotube will stay 
on the cylindrical surface, and the necking of the carbon nanotube does not occur in Stages 1-3. 
In addition, the tangential component of the average slip vector is also close to zero during the 
tension process. For the axial slip vector, when the strain is lower than 0.1, the averaged axial slip 
vector increases with the strain very slightly within Stage 1. Within Stage 2, this value displays an 
increasing tendency with the strain until 0.21 within Stage 3. Then the averaged axial slip vector 
will decrease with the strain within Stage 3.  
The variations of two characteristic angles and two characteristic bond lengths during the 
tension process are shown in Fig. 13(b) and the corresponding angles and bonds are displayed in 
the insert. L1 and L2 stand for axial C-C bonds and zigzag C-C bonds, which are parallel to the 
tube axis and form a specific angle with the tube axis, respectively. The angle forming between 
an axial bond and a zigzag bond is 1θ  and the angle between two zigzag bonds is considered 
as 2θ . At strain 0, the lengths of L1 and L2 are 1.43 Å and 1θ  and 2θ  are equal to about 120 
degrees. In Stage I, the averaged L1 bond lengths will increase with the strain, while the L2 bond 
lengths will remain almost constant. Meanwhile, 1θ  also increases with the strain, whereas 2θ  
decreases as the strain increases. The variation of 2θ  is about two times of that of 1θ , and L1, 1θ  
and 2θ  display linear relationships with the strain. At strain of 0.15, the variations of 1θ   and  
2θ  are about 4.5 and 9 degrees and the L1 and L2 increase 16.6 % and 3.4 %. Both the axial and 
tangential components of the slip vector of each carbon atom of the (17,0) carbon nanotube come 
from the vector variation sum of two zigzag bonds and one axial bond in the corresponding 
direction. The axial bond does not contribute to the variation of tangential slip vector, and the 
zero averaged tangential vector at Stages 1-3 indicates the variations of two zigzag bonds vary 
symmetrically with respect to the tube axis, resulting in the cancellation of the tangential slip 
vector calculated from each zigzag bond. For the variation of averaged axial slip vector, the 
in Fig. 15. In order to clearly investigate the fracture phenomena of the (17,0) carbon nanotube, 
additional morphologies at twelve different strains labeled as S7-S18 are also adopted to observe 
the variations of slip vector distributions in axial, radial, and tangential directions as shown in Fig. 
16. The stress-strain profile can be also divided into four stages, which display different slopes, 
denoted as Stages a-d in Fig. 15. The averaged axial, radial and tangential slip vectors will 
dramatically increase when the strain is larger than S11, indicating the necking and kinking of a 
(17,0) carbon nanotube occurs when the strain is larger than 0.25484. From strain S7 to S10, the 
radial and tangential slip vectors of each carbon atom are close to zero. This radial slip vector 
distribution indicates no necking occurs to the carbon nanotube, while the distribution of zero 
tangential slip vectors imply the deformations of two zigzag bonds are symmetrical with respect 
to the axial bond and no local distortions of carbon atoms occurs. At S7, the axial stress reaches 
the maximal value and the distributions of axial slip vectors do not show the concentration of 
some carbon atoms with higher slip vector values. At S8, the concentration of some carbon atoms 
with larger axial slip vectors appears and will propagate normal to the nanotube axial direction as 
depicted in S9 and S10. When the number of carbon atoms with larger axial slip vectors 
continuously increases and concentrates within the same area as in S11, the carbon atoms with 
larger radial and tangential slip vectors within the same areas, which comprise carbon atoms with 
larger axial slip vectors, appear, implying the necking of the carbon nanotube and the local 
distortions around carbon atoms occur within this area. As the strain continuously increases to 
S12 and 13, this area becomes larger and more significant. At S12 and S13, three slip vectors of 
carbon atoms, marked in red, clearly indicates the region of the necking, kinking and the local 
distortions around those carbon atoms. After strain is larger than S13, all three slip vectors of 
certain carbon atoms near the breaking region become very small, indicating these atoms have 
been released to the local structures like those at the zero axial stress at S1. At S14 and S15, the 
number of these released carbon atoms become more and propagate toward the two ends of the 
carbon nanotube. When the strain is larger than S16 to S18, at which the complete breaking of 
carbon nanotube occurs, the carbon atoms outside the necking region are totally released to the 
local carbon structures at strain 0 because all three slip vectors of these carbon atoms are close to 
zero. Chain-like structures appear from S13 to S15, carbon atoms with the necking area begin to 
vectors indicate almost all carbon atoms of the (17,0) carbon nanotube will stay on the cylindrical 
surface. Furthermore, the kinking deformation for the (17,0) zigzag tube rarely occurs when the 
crack occurs. In addition, non-symmetrical deformation around a carbon atom along the axial 
direction is also found. 
 
Several different structures—necking, local deformation and chain-like—of the SWNT after 
the strain is larger than the stress peak are observed. For axial slip vectors at S7-S10 in Stage 1, 
the local deformations of carbon atoms display a symmetrical break along the horizontal direction 
and normal to the tube axis, and such a break will grow with continuous tension. This 
deformation behavior normal to the tube axis which is obtained from our simulation is in good 
agreement with Belytschko’s study.32,41 In addition, after stage S13, several chain-like structures 
with 3 atoms or 4 atoms are observed in the necking area and the number of chain-like structures 
will decrease up to the breaking of the SWNT. Furthermore, at larger strains at and after S13, the 
local deformation, with the exception of the necking area, relapses to a local structure like those 
at zero stress at S1. 
 
Finally, this study makes a comparison of the deformation behavior of a (17, 0) zigzag SWNT 
with that of a (10,10) armchair tube (in our previous study34) under tensile strain. The differences 
between the carbon nanotubes are as following:   
1. Before the crack of the nanotube occurs: 
(i). The maximal axial non-symmetrical deformation of the (17, 0) zigzag tube occurs at strain of 
0.22 (in Stage 3), which coincides with the initial appearance of stress hardening. In contrast, 
the maximal axial non-symmetrical deformation of the (10, 10) armchair tube reaches its 
maximal value at strain of 0.28 (in Stage 2), after which the number of local distortions 
decrease and release the axial tensile stress until a strain of 0.35.  Finally, at that point, stress 
hardening begins to appear.  
 
(ii). The deformation along the axial direction of the (17, 0) zigzag tube belongs to 
non-symmetrical deformation, in which the average axial slip vector is not equal to zero.

Abstract: The mechanical and electronic properties of the (4, 4) armchair single-wall 
Silicon-Carbon Nanotube (SiCNT) under compression is studied. The Dmol3 package based on the 
density-functional theory (DFT) is adopted to simulate the structure and electron distribution of the 
atoms. During the simulations, a compression with strain 0.5% for each process is applied to the 
nanotube by applying a constant velocity to the two fixed layers in the axial direction. The results 
show that the Young’s modulus of (4, 4) armchair SiCNT is about 546 GPa. As compreesion strain 
imposed, the radial buckling and HOMO-LUMO gap of the tube will increase. The partial density 
of states (PDOS) of two neighboring Si and C atoms of the nanotube are further studied to 
demonstrate the strain effect on the electronic structure of nanotube.. 
 
Keywords: SiCNT, DFT, Strain, mechanical and ectronic properties. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
SiC material possess unique physical properties, such as high hardness, high thermal 
conductivity, and high radiation resistance [1], which are very suitable for applications in electronic 
and optical devices. Nanostructures of SiC, such as nanotubes,  nanowires, and nanorods have been 
wide spread interesting since the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [2]. Successfully 
synthesized SiCNTs—i.e., a reaction of silicon with a multiwalled carbon nanotube at different 
temperatures with Si to C at different ratios [3, 4] —are analogous to CNTs. The results of energy 
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses reveal that the composition of single-phase SiCNTs is 
only SiC grains and an Si to C atomic ratio of 1 [5]. 
As the fraction of Si increases over that of C, SiCNTs will lose their stability [5]. After 
relaxation, SiCNTs show the radial buckling behavior, where Si atoms move toward the tube axis 
and C atoms move in the opposite direction. The radial geometry of the tubular structures seems like 
two concentric cylindrical tubes for smaller sized SiCNTs [6, 7]. Regarding the electric conductivity, 
unlike CNTs, SiCNTs are always semiconductors with direct band gaps at the Г point for zigzag 
tubes and indirect gaps for armchair and chiral tubes [8-12], which are intrinsically suitable for gas 
The second term expresses the effect of the interactive forces. In Eq. (2), iV  is the Voronoi volume 
of atom i and is constructed by the perpendicular planes bisecting the lines between this atom and 
all of its neighboring atoms. Clearly, it is time-consuming to compute the Voronoi volume of each 
atom in the simulation system. Accordingly, Srolovitz et al. proposed the following formulation to 
obtain a sphere whose volume is equal to the original Voronoi volume:

3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Figure 2 shows the profiles of axial stress and the HOMO-LUMO gap at different strains for 
an armchair (4,4) SiCNT under compression. The length of the (4,4) SiCNT after relaxation by DFT 
method is defined as the referenced length at strain 0. The Young’s modulus for the nanotube can be 
calculated by the rate of change of stress with applied strain, and its value is approximate 546 Gpa, 
which almost equal to the experimental value for SiC nanorods (Y~0.61Tpa) [28]. As the strain 
reaches to 11.5%, the stress is 66.68 GPa. As for the profile of HOMO-LUMO gap, the gap values 
increase with an increase in axial strain, however, the gap values fluctuate as the strain larger than 
8.5%. Consequently, figure 2 clearly demonstrates that the mechanical deformation of an armchair 
(4,4) SiCNT significantly influences its electronic properties, and that the electronic property does 
not vary linearly with the strain.  
The variations of bond lengths and bending angles at different strains are shown in Fig. 3(b) 
and 3(c), and the corresponding bond lengths and bending angles are depicted in Fig. 3(a) for the 
SiCNT at strain 0. The Si-C bonds normal to the axial direction are designated as Bond-II, and the 
Si-C bonds slanted in the axial direction are labeled as Bond-I. The C atoms and their nearest three 
Si atoms form pyramidal structures and are not in the same plane; the C atoms occupy the top 
vertices and point outwards. The three bending angles at the Si centers are about 120 degrees and 
the Si atoms point towards the cross section center of the SiCNT. According to the bending angles 
formed by different bond types and the center atom type, four angles labeled as A, B, C, D are used 
to indicate different bending angle types in Fig. 3(c). In Fig. 3(b), the value of radial buckling at
