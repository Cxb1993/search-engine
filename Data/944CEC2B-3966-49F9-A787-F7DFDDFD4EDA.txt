Abstract— A random matrix is ergodic in one channel real-
ization if, for each column and row, the empirical distribution
of the squared magnitudes of elements therein converges to a
nonrandom distribution. In this paper, we derive expressions for
two asymptotic eigenvalue moments (AEM) related quantities
of a large Wishart-type random matrix HH† when H is
nonergodic in one channel realization. It is known the empirical
eigenvalue moments of HH† are dependent (or independent)
on realization of H when H is nonergodic (or ergodic) in one
channel realization. Thus, for nonergodic H, the AEM can be
obtained by firstly deriving conditional AEM given a certain
realization of H and then averaging the conditional quantities
over the ensemble of H. Since the AEM are independent of H’s
realization if H is ergodic, the derived conditional AEM can
also serve as the AEM formula for ergodic H when one of its
realizations is available. Both recursive and nonrecursive forms
of conditional AEM expressions are obtained in this research.
I. INTRODUCTION
Let Hi,j denote the (i, j)-th entry of matrix H. The random
channel matrix H is ergodic in one channel realization if, for
each column and row, the empirical distribution of |Hi,j |2
therein converges to a nonrandom distribution [1, Defintion
2.3]. It is known, if H is ergodic in one channel realization,
the empirical eigenvalue distribution of HH† converges a.s.
to a nonrandom limit whose Stieltjes transform can be given
by [2, Corollary 10.1.2], where it can be seen the asymptotic
spectral distribution (AED) as well as asymptotic eigenvalue
moment (AEM) of HH† are independent of any specific
realization of H. However, in many practical applications, H is
nonergodic in one channel realization. In this paper, we assume
that, although H is nonergodic in one channel realization, it
is ergodic in the time domain. Specifically, we suppose that
the realization of H is controlled by some random variables
(denoted by θ); conditioned on a certain H, the conditional
AEM converges asymptotically to quantities that are functions
of realizations of θ. Since H is ergodic in the time domain,
further averaging over the ensemble of the random vector θ
yields the unconditional AEM.
Most previous works employing asymptotic results of eigen-
values of HH† either assume H is ergodic in one channel
realization or have the results conditioned on a certain real-
ization of H. Examples of nonergodic H include a one-shot
asynchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) system
[3], an multicarrier (MC)-CDMA system [1], the spare virtual
channel matrix (or called coupling matrix) of multiple-input
and multiple-output (MIMO) [4], [5], and so on. Some related
works about AEM computation with independent but non-
identically distributed (i.n.d.) entries of H are summarized,
and short comments are made to compare them with our
work. Expressions for AEM of HH† are derived in [6] for
the cases that entries of H are zero-mean and i.n.d. and H
is ergodic in one channel realization. The expressions are
recursion based. They are obtained by expanding the fixed-
point equation of the Stieltjes transform of AED as a power
series. As a Stieltjes transform can be formulated as power
series with moments as the coefficients, AEM are identified by
equating the two power series expressions (one by expanding
the fixed-point equation of the Stieltjes transform, and the
other by a power series with moments as the coefficients) and
comparing the coefficients of every degree at either side of the
equality. In the current paper, when a particular realization of
H is considered, we derive conditional AEM expressions in
both direct and recursive forms. For the latter, our expression
exhibits a simpler form than that in [6]. Recursive forms
have the advantage of lower computation complexity when the
moment order is high; however, it is inconvenient to perform
averaging process on them to obtain unconditional AEM
formulas. In [7], a fundamental observation is made that limits
of Gaussian band matrices are operator-valued semicircular
elements; thus operator-valued free probability can be used
for determining their eigenvalue distribution. The works of [8],
[9] employ the result of [7] and take an operator-valued free
probability approach to calculate the limits of the eigenvalue
distributions of a number of block matrices, including Wishart-
type block matrices. In the intermediate process, the operator-
valued moments in a recurrence relation can be obtained. By
using a trick of putting H and H† in off-diagonal blocks of a
2 × 2 block matrix X (diagonal blocks are zero matrices), a
Gaussian matrix X is obtained whose AEM (conditional) has
a simple mapping with the AEM of HH†. However, the AEM
obtained in this way is also in recurrence, and it is inconvenient
to extend to unconditional AEM.

where the superscript (N) denotes that the quantity is evaluated
when H has N number of rows, hk is the k-th column of H,
and H∼k is H with hk removed. Suppose that µ

converge to µm and δm,k, respectively, when K,N → ∞
and K/N → β. The importance of these asymptotic moment-
related quantities are explained below.
• The quantity µm is the general definition for the m-th
AEM of HH†.
• The quantity δm,k is often used in the design and per-
formance evaluation of a reduced-rank receiver with the
received signal model y = Hx+w, e.g. [6].
III. ASYMPTOTIC MOMENTS CONDITIONED ON A
CERTAIN REALIZATION
Consider an N × K random matrix H as described in
Section II. We define
µˆm := lim
K,N→∞
K/N→β
E{µ(N)m |v(N)(x, y)},
and δˆm,k := lim
K,N→∞
K/N→β
E{δ(N)m,k|v(N)(x, y)}. (7)
In this section, we compute the above two quantities that are
conditioned on a specific v(N)(x, y), and we show that µˆm and
δˆm,k are the limiting values of the sequences given in (5) and
(6), respectively, for each particular realization of v(N)(x, y).
Knowledge about noncrossing partitions in set partition theory
is required and can be found in [10].
Theorem 1: Conditioned on v(N)(x, y), the random se-
quences µ(N)m and δ
(N)
m,k converge a.s. to µˆm and δˆm,k, re-
spectively, as K,N →∞ and K/N → β. We have
µˆm =

and
δˆm,k =

vk(X1)

where NC(m) denotes the set consisting of all noncrossing
partitions of {1, 2, · · · ,m}, $ = {B1, · · · , B|$|} means that
$ is composed of blocks B1, · · · , B|$|, BK($)(t) represents
the index of the block in which the element t locates in
the Kreweras complementation map of $, and the expecta-
tions are with respect to continuous i.i.d. random variables
X1, · · · , Xm−|$|+1, Y1, · · · , Y|$| uniformly distributed in
[0, 1).
Proof: The proofs of all theorems in this paper can be
found in [10].
Note that, since the AEM of HH† are independent of
realizations of H if H is ergodic in one channel realization,
the derived conditional AEM in Theorem 1 can also serve
as the AEM formula for ergodic H when one of its realiza-
tions is available. Issues regarding the complexity reduction
in obtaining µˆm and δˆm,k above are addressed before we
move on to taking ensemble average of conditional AEM
according to the distribution of v(N)(x, y). To evaluate the
expressions in (8) and (9), it requires (m + 1)-dimensional
integrals with the m-th Catalan number of times2. When
the order m of the moment is high, the computation cost
is huge. If the conditional variance profile v(x, y) possesses
a special structure, the AEM expressions can be simplified
through properties of noncrossing partitions. For instance, if
v(x, y) is decomposable as g(x)h(y), where g(x) and h(y) are
nonnegative valued functions with span [0, 1), then formulas
given in Theorem 1 admit simpler forms. The complexity
can also be reduced by resorting to recursions in conditional
AEM expressions. We explore these two ways of complexity
reduction below.
The simpler form of µˆm when v(x, y) = g(x)h(y) has
been obtained in Theorem 3 of [6]. Due to the page limit, the
formula of δˆm,k given that v(x, y) = g(x)h(y) is not listed
here, and it can be found in Theorem 2 of [10].
In the following theorem, recursive formulas of µˆm and
δˆm,k are provided. They have simpler forms compared with
those given in [6] (Theorems 1 and 2 of [6] with notations
µm and δm,k) by means of expanding the Stieltjes transform
equations (3) and (4). For some particular variance profile, it is
possible to obtain closed-form conditional AEM expressions
by symbolic operations of scientific computation softwares
such as MATLAB.
Theorem 2: The a.s. limiting value of E{µ(N)m |v(N)(x, y)}
can be given as
µˆm = β · E{µ˜m(X,Y )}, (10)
where the expectation is over i.i.d. random variables X and Y
that are uniformly distributed in [0, 1), and µ˜m(x, y) can be
obtained from the recursion
µ˜m(x, y)
= v(x, y)

with µ˜0(x, y) = 1. Also, we have
δˆm,k = β · E{vk(X)µ˜m(X,Y )}, (12)
where X and Y are i.i.d. uniform random variables in [0, 1).

the (i, j)-th and (i′, j′)-th entries of H be represented by
RH(i, j; i′, j′) = E{Hi,jH∗i′,j′}.
It is shown in [1] that any MIMO channel with correlation
RH that falls within the unitary-independent-unitary (UIU)
framework and has bounded eigenvalues is unitarily equivalent
to an independent nonidentically distributed (IND) channel H˜
with the mean and variance of the (i, j)-th entry equal to 0
and the (i, j)-th eigenvalue of RH, respectively.
We consider Example 2 of [1], where nT = 3, nR = 2, and
an IND channel H˜ whose component has variance equal to
the entry of G at the same location with
G =
[
0.4 3.6 0.5
0.3 1 0.2
]
. (21)
Each (i, j)-th entry of H˜ has independent real and
imaginary parts uniformly distributed in the interval
[−√1.5Gi,j ,√1.5Gi,j ]. It is known that the normalized

input covariance matrix, and F (X) is the cumulative distribu-
tion function of X . Thus, the liming mutual information can
be obtained by letting g(x) = log2(1 + γx) in (20), and the
AEM of H˜ΦH˜† is acquired from those of H˜H˜† and Φ using
the result of [12].
Fig. 1 shows both the simulated and analytical results of
the capacity and the spectral efficiency with uniform power
allocation versus input SNR, where the capacity-achieving
power allocation Φ is found by using the algorithm in [13],
and two curves showing analytical results are obtained using
a 5-point quadrature rule. The analytical results in Fig. 1
using the moment-based method have a slight performance
gain compared with the transform-based method presented in
[1]. The gain in terms of error percentage3 becomes more
and more obvious when the input SNR gets larger. When the
input SNR is equal to 20dB, capacities based on the Monte-
Carlo simulation, the methods in [1] and this paper are 11.49,
11.09, and 11.41 (bits/s/Hz), respectively; spectral efficiency
with uniform power of the three methods in the same order
are 11.37, 10.99, and 11.17 (bits/s/Hz).
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, expressions of several AEM related quantities
are derived for a large Wishart-type random matrix HH†
when H is nonergodic in one channel realization. These
quantities are useful in the design and analysis of a number
of communication systems. It was assumed that H =M¯S,
where entries of S are zero-mean i.i.d. random variables, and
columns {|Mi,j |2 : 1 ≤ i ≤ N} are realizations of i.i.d
random processes. The derivation started from obtaining the
conditional AEM given a certain realization of M, and we then
derived unconditional AEM by computing ensemble average
of the conditional quantity according to the distribution of M.
We have obtained conditional AEM expressions in both direct
and recursive forms.

Figure 1. Received block signals at the receiver during a data frame
transmission of N = 64 blocks. The underlying virtual MIMO
channel matrix Hv has changed for p ≥ 33 due to disconnection
of cooperative relays from the network [see (5)].
where hi ∈ CNr denotes the physical channel vector from the ith
relay to the receiver. The entries of H are assumed to be indepen-
dently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian random
variables with zero mean and unit variance.
For the case that the receiver has the perfect knowledge of the
virtual MIMO channel matrix
Hv = RH, (4)
the coherent ML detector can be used to detect the unknown data
{sp}Np=1 in a symbol-by-symbol fashion [6]. The performance of
the coherent ML detector for the randomized DOSTBC has been an-
alyzed in [3]. In particular, by assuming that
A1) The randomization matrix R is full rank with probability one,
and the value of E{det−1(RRH)} is finite,
Sirkeci-Mergen and Scaglione showed that the randomized DOSTBC
scheme attains the maximum transmit diversity order Nt with the co-
herent ML detector for Ns ≥ Nt. However, the performance of ML
detection can be impaired if the information of Hv at the receiver is
mismatched [7].
In the paper, we consider a situation that the virtual channel ma-
trix mismatch is caused by the problem that some of the coopera-
tive relays unexpectedly disconnect from the network. For instance,
suppose that a data frame contains 64 code blocks (N = 64). We
assume that the virtual channel matrix Hv has been trained well in
the coherent receiver before the data transmission, and the coherent
receiver assumes that the virtual channel matrix Hv would remain
static as the physical channel matrixH during the data transmission.
Under this setting, if the first two relays disconnect from the net-
work without notification after p = 32 (as shown in Figure 1), then
for p ≥ 33, the virtual channel matrix changes to

Hence, the coherent ML receiver has a mismatched virtual channel
matrix information for p ≥ 33. In Figure 2, we show some simula-
tion results (average bit-error-rate (BER)) of the mismatched coher-
ent ML detector when there were respectively 2 and 4 relays discon-
necting from the network after p = 32 (i.e., ∆Ns = 2 and ∆Ns =
4) (The simulation setting is described in Section 4). In comparison
with the results with no disconnecting relays (i.e., ∆Ns = 0), we
can see from the figure that the performance of the mismatched co-
herent ML detector is much worse and exhibits an error floor for high
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). It is worthwhile to notice that this per-
formance degradation is much more severe than that due to imperfect
channel estimation [7,8]. In the latter case, the mismatched coherent
ML detector can still maintain the maximum transmit diversity order
Nt [8].

To alleviate the relay disconnection effects, one of the possible
strategies is to allocate additional pilot codes among the 64 block
codes for channel tracking. This strategy, however, leads to a spec-
trum efficiency loss. In the next section, we propose a different
strategy based on recent developments on blind ML OSTBC detec-
tion [4, 5].
3. BLIND ML DOSTBC DETECTION AND UNIQUE DATA
IDENTIFIABILITY
In the section, we follow the recent results in [4] and [5] to present a
blind ML DOSTBC detector and a randomized NIS-DOSTBC code
scheme. We show that, with a mild assumption on the transmission
protocol, the proposed blind ML detector can be robust against the
relay disconnection problem as mentioned in Section 2.
3.1. Blind ML DOSTBC Detection
Before presenting the proposed blind ML DOSTBC detector, we
consider the following assumption on the transmission protocol:
A2) The cooperative relay will not transmit signal if it cannot trans-
mit a complete burst of P code blocks, where P is a small positive
integer (e.g., P = 4 ∼ 8).
Assumption A2) implies that the disconnection time of cooperative
relays can only be a multiple of P blocks. In view of this, let us
define
sm = [s
T
mP+1, . . . , s
T
(m+1)P ]
T ∈ {±1}K¯m , (6)
where K¯m = KmP+1 + · · · + K(m+1)P , and rewrite (2) as the

4. SIMULATION RESULTS
In the section, we present some simulation results to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed blind ML decoder and the random-
ized NIS-DOSTBC scheme [in (15)]. We considered a relay network
with 9 cooperative relays (Ns = 9), and set N = 64, Nr = 2 and
P = 8. Both the physical channel matrix H and randomization
matrix R were generated by i.i.d. complex Gaussian random vari-
ables with zero mean and unit variance. The 4 by 3 code in (13) was
employed, and the blind ML detector in (10) was solved by a sub-
optimal method based on semidefinite relaxation [4]. The SNR was
defined as
SNR =
E{‖C(sp)RH‖2F }/Kp
E{‖W‖2F }
,
and each simulation result was obtained from 10,000 trials. In the
simulation, the first two relays were set disconnected from the net-
work abruptly after p = 32 (as shown in Figure 1). The coherent ML
detector did not have knowledge of this and used the virtual channel
matrix information before the disconnection to detect all the sym-
bols at all times. Since Shahbazpanahi’s subspace method [9] and
the differential OSTBC scheme [11] are applicable to the random-
ized DOSTBC systems, they were also simulated for comparison. It
is worthwhile to mention that, for fairness of comparison, Shahbaz-
panahi’s subspace method estimated the virtual channel matrix Hv
for every set of P consecutive block codes.
Figure 3 shows the average BER for the first 32 block codes,
during which the virtual channel matrix Hv was composed of the
channel vectors of all the 9 cooperative relays, and the coherent ML
detector has the perfect information of Hv. One can see from this
figure that all the detectors under consideration perform consistently,
and the proposed blind ML detector outperforms Shahbazpanahi’s
subspace method and the differential scheme. Figure 4 presents the
average BER for the last 32 block codes, during which the virtual
channel matrix Hv was composed of the channel vectors of the 7
active cooperative relays, and thus the coherent ML detector has the
mismatched channel information. Comparing this figure with Figure
3, the proposed blind ML detector and Shahbazpanahi’s subspace
method can still yield consistent BER performance since they per-
formed detection in a P -block-by-P -block manner. By contrast, the
differential scheme exhibits an error floor as the (mismatched) co-
herent ML detector since there are always errors in detecting s33
because Y32 is not an accurate channel estimate for Y33 for differ-
ential decoding.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In the paper, we have presented an NIS-DOSTBC scheme and a
blind ML detector for the randomized DOSTBC system with achiev-

A2), we have shown that the proposed blind ML detection scheme
outperforms some existing methods, and is particularly effective for
the situation where there are cooperative relays unexpectedly dis-
connecting from the network during the data frame transmission.
6. APPENDIX: PROOF OF THEOREM 2
For simplicity, let us assume that Nr = 1 and rewrite (7) as
ym = G(sm)Rh+wm. (16)
We use G1 and G2 to represent the two distinct codewords G(sm)
and G(s′m) (sm 6= ±s′m), respectively. By (10), we show in the
