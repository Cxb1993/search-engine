such as SNPicker [15], NEBcutter [16], SRP Opt [17], 
PIRA-PCR Designer [18], SNP cutter [19], SNPselector 
[20], SNP2CAPS [21], and software for “Restriction of 
DNA sequences” [22] have been reviewed and 
compared to SNP-RFLPing (ver. 1) [23]. Other more 
recent SNP-related software tools have also been 
developed, such as SNP500Cancer [24], which 
provides genecentric SNP retrieval with TaqMan probe 
information but only for the SNPs associated with 
human cancerrelated genes. Another is Seq4SNPs [25], 
which provides retrieval of multiple accurately 
annotated DNA sequences that have already been 
formatted for SNP assay design. SNP-Flankplus [26] 
provides SNP ID-centric retrieval functions for SNP 
flanking sequences. SNPLogic [27] provides 
comprehensive SNP selection, annotation and a 
prioritization system for genotyping. SNP ID-info [28] 
as well as a visual SNP ID platform for multiple inputs 
can be used to improve systematic SNP association 
studies. However, none of these software platforms 
provide RFLP information that can be used as part of 
SNP genotyping. In 2006, we developed SNP-RFLPing 
(ver. 1) [23], an efficient and informative PCR-RFLP 
mining tool for SNPs, which provided user-friendly 
multiple sequence input formats, gene-centric RFLP 
assays for SNPs, and detailed output of the SNP 
information. To the best of our knowledge, 
SNP-RFLPing (ver. 1) was the first software to link the 
gene name to its SNP-RFLP restriction enzyme 
information. In the past three years, the numbers of 
known SNPs [29] and their RFLP restriction enzymes 
[30] have accumulated rapidly for the genomes of many 
species. Many new resources, such as tagSNP [31], 
miRNA [32], and gene ontology (GO) [33] are related 
to the study of SNP but display a relatively small 
amount of the relevant information needed for SNP 
genotyping. This paper presents an update, 
SNPRFLPing 2, of SNP-RFLPing (ver. 1), which acts 
as a software tool that introduces and integrates a 
PCRRFLP database for SNP genotyping. 
 
Implementation 
Web interface The flow chart for the eight input 
functions, namely: (1) SNP IDs, (2) SNP fasta 
sequences, (3) multiple SNPs, (4) accession key, (5) tag 
SNP, (6) transcript ID/miRNA, (7) CGAP GO, and (8) 
file upload, is shown in Figure 1. Their corresponding 
processes are performed as indicated by arrow lines. 
For inputs of SNP IDs, accession key and tag SNP, the 
“Data Retrieve Module” is designed to retrieve data 
from remote databases, such as NCBI nucleotide, NCBI 
dbSNP, and HapMap, into the “Remote Database 
Module”. For inputs of SNP fasta sequences, multiple 
SNPs, and file upload, the “Sequence Process Module” 
is designed to filter non-nucleotide symbols, including 
blanks, commas, and brackets. For inputs of transcript 
ID/miRNA and CGAP GO (gene ontology in the 
Cancer Genome Anatomy Project), the “Data Query 
Module” is designed to query available information 
from the “SNP-RFLP database Module”. After the 
“Remote Database Module”, “Sequence Process 
Module”, or “Data Query Module” processes are 
performed, the remote data (NCBI nucleotide, NCBI 
dbSNP, and HapMap), the filtered sequence data 
(without non-nucleotide symbols), and query data from 
SNP-RFLP database (REBASE, CGAP GO, miRSNP, 
SNP-RFLP, and SNP500Cancer Assays_SNPs) are fed 
into the “SNP-RFLP Module”, which then mines the 
data for the available restriction enzyme sites as 
appropriate. Subsequently, PCR-RFLP primers can be 
designed using the “Primer Design Module”. Finally, 
the results for the available restriction enzymes and 
PCR-RFLP primers are output by the“Output Module”. 
Detailed information on the databases used by 
SNP-RFLPing is outlined below. 
 
Database description 
All the PCR-RFLP functions in SNP-RFLPing 2 
provide both the RFLP restriction enzymes and primer 
set for PCR-RFLP. The primer design function is partly 
based on the Prim-SNPing [34], that is the regular and 
mutagenic (degenerate) primer designs for PCR-RFLP 
are provided. Moreover, the price of the possible RFLP 
enzymes is a newly added feature and RFLP enzymes 
are now classified into IUPAC and non-IUPAC 
(recognition sequences containing only the combination 
 I. Original functions in SNP-RFLPing (ver. 1) and 
their improvements 
SNP ID input, SNP in fasta sequence input, and file 
upload SNP ID (rs# and ss#) and SNP in fasta sequence 
formats are acceptable to query the SNP-RFLP 
information (Figure 2A and Figure 2B, respectively). 
Two types of files are acceptable for file upload, 
namely SNP IDs (rs#, ss#, or mixture of rs#/ss#) and 
SNP fasta sequences (multiple sequences with SNPs in 
[dNTP1/dNTP2] or IUPAC formats) (Figure 2H). 
These functions were also originally included in 
SNP-RFLPing (ver. 1). In SNP-RFLPing 2, we have 
newly added a function for RFLP analysis and primer 
design involving tri-allelic, tetra-allelic, and indel 
(insertion and deletion) SNPs, such as, for example, 
rs2243244, rs13631133, and rs68134313 respectively. 
Furthermore, SNP ID information for all available 
species can be retrieved on-line using SNP-RFLPing 2 
rather than from the local database that was built into 
SNP-RFLPing (ver. 1), that is sixteen genomes (current 
data) vs. three genomes (human, mouse, and rat) 
respectively. 
 
GenBank Accession 
The inputs for the GenBank accession no. [35], such as 
reference SNP ID (rs#), submitter SNP ID (ss#), HUGO 
gene name, and local link ID (gene ID), which can be 
used to retrieve the SNP sequence information for 
RFLP analysis, are the same as the original functions in 
SNPRFLPing (ver. 1). In SNP-RFLPing 2 (Figure 2D) 
additional input formats for accession version and local 
SNP ID have been added. The classification of dbSNP 
in NCBI for functional class (coding nonsynonymous, 
reference, intron, coding synonymous, locus region, 
mRNA UTR, and splice site), SNP class (heterozygous, 
indel, mixed, multinucleotide polymorphism, named 
locus, no variation, and snp), and heterozygosity are 
selectable in GenBank accession input. Furthermore, 
the entire information contained in GenBank can be 
retrieved on-line for all available species and this is 
integrated in SNP-RFLPing 2.  
 
II. Added improvements to SNP-RFLPing 2 
Multiple SNPs within one sequence Up to 50 SNPs 
represented in the [dNTP1/dNTP2] or IUPAC formats 
within an input sequence are acceptable for analysis in 
SNP-RFLPing 2 (Figure 2C). The flanking sequences 
for two nearby SNPs should not overlap within a range 
of 6 nucleotides. The pre-aligned reference sequence, 
such as that generated by the multiple sequence 
alignment function in Seq-SNPing [36], may be input 
into the SNP-RFLPing 2 for RFLP mining of multiple 
SNPs as well. 
 
TagSNP from HapMap 
To reduce the necessary amount of SNPs for 
genotyping, it was believed that a subset of the SNPs in 
a region (tagSNPs) ought be chosen to represent most 
of the remaining SNP variants [37]. As shown in Figure 
2E, the HapMap database versions, population, 
pairwise methods (tagger pairwise or tagger 
multimarkers), R square cutoff, and MAF (minor allele 
frequency) cutoff can all be user-adjusted in 
SNP-RFLPing 2. The position within the chromosome, 
accession number, gene name, cytoband position, and 
ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) [38] 
region can also be queried. The tagSNPs information 
from HapMap is retrieved online and the mining 
function of RFLP restriction enzymes for tagSNPs is 
implemented in SNP-RFLPing 2. 
Transcript ID/miRNA MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a 
group of small RNAs that are able to bind to the RNA 
transcripts of protein-coding genes and this allows them 
to repress translation or decrease mRNA stability 
[39,40]. Dysfunction of miRNAs influences cell 
biology and cancer progression [41]. Polymorphisms in 
miRNA pathways may affect gene expression, which 
may lead to a change in complex phenotypes, and such 
polymorphisms have the potential to be disease markers 
for personalized medicine [42]. Transcript IDs and 
miRNA numbers from the human and mouse datasets 
are acceptable for PCR-RFLP analysis (Figure 2F). The 
RFLP enzyme mining and primer design for transcript 
IDs and miRNA are newly developed and have been 
integrated in the SNP-RFLPing 2. Gene
