英 文 摘 要 ： This study aims to employ localized meshless methods 
to establish numerical models for the numerical 
analysis of real-life engineering problems. In this 
report, we mainly demonstrate our research in this 
one-year project, includes the localized meshless 
models of Burgers equation, shallow-water equation, 
and the technique of interpolation for high-dimension 
cases.  
In the first part of this article, we propose 
applying Cole-Hopf transformation to transform the 
Burgers equation into linear diffusion equation and 
solving it by the finite difference - localized 
method of particular solution (FD-LMPS). By the Cole-
Hopf transformation, the difficulty raised from the 
nonlinearity can be totally avoided. By numerical 
experiments including propagating wave, diffusive N-
wave and multidimensional wave within irregular 
domain, the fact that the FD-LMPS is a promising tool 
for numerical analysis of the Burgers equations is 
convinced. 
In the second part, we apply the localized radial-
basis-function based differential quadrature (LRBFDQ) 
method to establish a numerical model of 2D nonlinear 
shallow water equations (SWE). In this work, the 
established numerical model is verified through 
simulating two typical SWE problems: a tidal wave and 
a dam-break problem, and then applied to the 
numerical analysis of the inflow discharge in the 
Yuanshantze Flood Diversion (YFD) which is located at 
the upstream of the Keelung River in Taiwan.  
In the third part, we test another localized meshless 
shallow-water model. In this model, the Houbolt 
method is introduced for the temporal discretization 
and the Newton-Raphson method is used to improve the 
stability for the nonlinearity within the governing 
equations. The tests in this study not only show the 
great stability for simulating periodic variations, 
but also discuss the applicability of the available 
boundary conditions. 
In addition to the establishment of the numerical 
models, an interpolation technique based on the 
LRBFDQ method is proposed to interpolate the field

本報告第一部分首先介紹以 Burgers 方程式控制之波動模型之建立。此模型
主要利用 Cole-Hopf 轉換技巧將較難求解之非線性 Burgers 方程式轉換為線性擴
散方程式後，再以有限差分-局部特解法求解之。數值算例包括前進波、擴散 N

一步針對真實應用時經常引起爭議之邊界條件適用性進行探討分析。 
除了建立數值模式之外，本團隊亦嘗試利用局部化徑向基底函數微分積分
法的概念對於內插領域再次進行革命性的衝擊。藉由對於 Poisson 方程式以及對
流-擴散方程式必須滿足的掌握，無網格方法所使用的高階高維度的內插技術早
已將傳統線性或二階多項式內插的低精度數值逼近拋於遠遠的後方。 
透過這份技術報告可說明在此一年研究計畫的成果展示本團隊不僅達成目標，

1. The finite difference - localized method of particular 
solutions with Cole-Hopf transformation for solving the 
Multidimensional Burgers equations 
1.1. Introduction 
The Burgers equations, are nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) consisting an 
unsteady term, a convection term and a diffusion term. The Burgers equations depicts 
propagating wave with quadratic nonlinearity, it can be used to describe nonlinear wave 
propagation and shock wave [1]. The Burgers equations was widely applied for 
mathematic analysis and problems of fluid mechanics. 
  In this paper we approximated the solution of the Burgers equations by novel 
numerical approach. In order to overcome the nonlinearity of the Burgers equations, the 
process of root approximation had been seriously considered for this research. The 
basic root approximation for nonlinear equations are usually implement by iterative 
approach such as the Newton-Ralphson method[2], but the implement of iterative 
approach always accompany with risk in failure of convergence. In contrast to the 
iterative approach, the direct approach for approximating the root of Burgers equations 
can overcome the nonlinearity through finite sequence of operations which avoid the 
risk of convergence problems. Such direct approaches can be easily found in literatures 
for solving Burgers equations, for example the well-known Euler-Lagrange method[3]. 
Apart from root approximation approaches introduced above, for the Burgers equations 
there exists another direct approach which is named — the Cole-Hopf 
transformation[4,5]. 
  The Cole-Hopf transformation was introduced by Hopf and Cole in 1950s to deal 
with the nonlinearity of the viscous Burgers equations, by transforming the 
multi-dimensional Burgers equations into a linear diffusion equation, depicting the 
multiple variable problems in a single variable form. The analytical solution of the 
diffusion equation can be simply found by solving the Cauchy problem, therefore it 
provides a route to obtain analytical solutions for the Burgers equations. In this research 
the Cole-Hopf transformation is applied to deal with the nonlinearity of Burgers 
equations for further numerical processes.  
In order to construct numerical matrix system of the governing equations, the essential 
conditions such as initial and boundary conditions are also necessarily transformed 
according to the definition of Cole-Hopf transformation. For one-dimensional Burgers 
equation, throughout Cole-Hopf transform the numerical matrix system remains as a

basis-function of the summation equation approximating the solution, LRBFDQ 
applies the differential quadrature (DQ), while the LMPS uses the integrated radial 
basis functions (IRBF). In numerical algorithm these two local meshless numerical 
methods exists many similarities, however the basis-function chosen has made them 
mathematically different. Mathematically, integrating a function will obtain a solution 
function with an unknown constant, causing differences in solutions obtained from 
these two methods. Despite the differences, both shows very well performance in 
numerical simulation due to the same localization technique they shared. The technique 
itself will be further described in this paper and references. 
  The time domain and space domain are considered with different approaches of 
description. The time domain is discretized by Crank-Nicolson method, where the 
Crank-Nicolson method is an implicit unconditional stable scheme with the 
second-order accuracy. For the space domain, the LMPS is chosen to discretize the 
domain and approximate the solutions. Now with the Cole-Hopf transformation to 
transform the Burgers equations into diffusion equations, the FD approximates 
transient term and the LMPS applied for space discretization. Combining these 
methods integrates into the proposed numerical model of FD-LMPS with Cole-Hopf 
transformation, and carries out numerical experiments to solve the Burgers equations. 
There are totally four numerical experiments that will be carried out in present research 
to test the capability of the proposed numerical model of FD-LMPS with the Cole-Hopf 
transformation. In order are the one-dimensional Burgers problem with propagating 
wave, the one-dimensional Burgers problem with diffusive N-wave, the 
two-dimensional Burgers problem in L-shaped irregular domain and the 
three-dimensional Burgers problem in irregular domain. Each numerical solution will 
be compared with the corresponding analytical solution of each problem, and the error 
distribution will be shown in the form of maximum relative error and   norm error. 
Further detail of the proposed numerical model are explained in the following sections 
1.2. The theoretical model 
1.2.1 Governing equation – Burgers equation 
The Burgers equation is a nonlinear equation which includes the convection term 
and diffusion term. The nonlinearity of the convection term causes difficulties to 
obtain solutions, which needs processes for root approximation. For the computational 
domain   including the boundary, the Burgers equation in vector form can be written 
as:

Evidently, if the solution  ,x t satisfies the diffusion equation as Eq.14,  ,u x t will 
automatically satisfy the Burgers equation, the exact same procedure can be applied 
for different variables or different dimensions. 
The diffusion equation can produce analytical solution by giving initial condition 
and apply further derivation for Cauchy problem, but in this paper we implement the 
localized meshless method of LMPS to solve diffusion equation numerically. 
1.3. Numerical methods 
1.3.1. Localized method of particular solutions 
In this paper, the LMPS is applied to approximate the solution of the diffusion 
equation transformed from the Cole-Hopf transformation. Here we will introduce the 
linkage of MPS and LMPS briefly. Originally in the MPS, the solution of i is 
approximated by the summation of the weighted radial basis functions,

where Eq.(1.22) is the local linear system for solving the Laplace equation, also 
depicting the governing equation discretized by LMPS of the thi  global point.

where each 

Combining this system with appropriate boundary conditions will produce unique 
solutions for  i  after solving the linear system, for further detail in solving Burgers 
equation please see the paragraph for numerical procedure. 
1.3.2. Integrated Multi-quadric radial basis function 
The integrated multi-quadric radial basis function (integrated MQ-RBF) is used as 
weighting function in this paper. For multi-dimensional problems, the integrated 
MQ-RBFs are listed as follows:

Therefore the global sparse linear system will be written as follow 
       10 0Tu   I   (1.39)  
By repeating Eq.(1.36)-(1.39) for variable v , and combining the systems of both 
variable. The result is an over-determinant sparse linear system of    0A x , with 
2N  equations and N  unknowns. In this paper the system will be solved by the 
MA49 solver. 
1.4.2. Governing Equation 
  After obtaining the variable   from previous time step, the procedure continues to 
approximate solution for next time step. The time-marching method of 
Crank-Nicolson scheme discretized the time domain, giving the diffusion equation 
written in Eq.(1.4):

replace any governing equation’s position, meaning all cases including the 
one-dimensional are over-determined. 
1.5. Numerical experiments 
In order to display the capability of the proposed numerical model solving the Burgers 
equation, total of four numerical experiments have been carried out to examine the 
capability of the proposed FD-LMPS with Cole-Hopf transformation. All numerical 
experiments are compared with analytical solutions. The error distribution applied in 
this research includes the maximum relative error ERel and the 
2L  norm error EL2, 
which are defined as

Given 1,2,...,i N , and N  is the number of resolution points, given the same as 
global point in here.  
1.5.1. One-dimensional Burgers problem with propagating wave 
The first example is set to verify the proposed numerical model’s capability in 
dealing with Burgers problem depicting a propagating wave. Here the Reynolds 
number defines the dominancy between diffusion term and convection term, higher 
Reynolds number leads to stronger effect of the convection term, and vice versa. In 
this example when higher Reynolds number is adopted, the solution will be more 
similar to a step function or a Heaviside function, making it more difficult to obtain a 
good numerical solution. 
The analytical solution of this experiment is given as:

where the initial condition can be found by setting 0t   and boundary condition can

Fig. 1.1(a)-(c) are the evolution of physical value u  at different time steps. From 
Fig. 1.1(a) we can see when Re 1 , the physical value u  distributes a straight line 
with constant slope. When Reynolds number increases to 10 or 100 as shown in Fig. 
1.1(b)-(c), obvious wave front can be observed propagating through the computational 
domain. Adopting higher Reynolds number results in a steeper wave front.

Initial condition can be found by setting 0t   and boundary condition obtained by 
substituting the time and boundary coordinates into the analytical solution, the total 
time elapse will be defined later for different cases. 
  Fig. 1.6(a)-(f) and 1.7(a)-(f) shows the evolution of physical values  and u v  with 
different Reynolds number. It can be observed different Reynolds number leads to 
similar pattern of evolution, only different in the speed of evolution and the value 
order of physical value wanted. 
  For detail analysis of the proposed numerical model, different time interval, 
different global points and different local points have been tested in this example. Fig. 
1.8(a)-(f) shows the error distributions for physical value u  of this example, which 
is very similar to the ones for physical value v . From observation we can find adding 
more global points or local points can achieve better accuracy. Comparing the 
numerical solution of adding global points and local point, it is obvious adding few 
local points can obtain the same accuracy as adding many global points. Along with 
the advantage of smaller matrix system, one can determine adding local points are 
more efficient than adding global points. Fig. 1.9(a)-(b) depicts the error distribution 
of Re 1 with 1000 global points, it proves using smaller time interval can also 
acquire solution with better accuracy. For error distribution in space, Fig. 1.10(a)-(b) 
gives a picture that error for initial condition is pretty evenly distributed. However, 
Fig. 1.10(c)-(f) shows the relative error focused more near the boundary domain and

1.5.4. Three-dimensional Burgers problem in irregular domain 
For the final example of this paper, the three dimensional Burgers problem in irregular 
domain is tested to verify the proposed model of FD-LMPS is capable of treating 
multidimensional Burgers problems in irregular domain. The computational domain of 
this experiment is given as Fig. 1.11:

avoided the problem of likely ill-condition matrix. Totally four cases were shown in 
previous paragraphs. All four numerical experiments, namely, the one-dimensional 
Burgers problem with wave propagation, the one-dimensional Burgers problem with 
diffusive N-wave, the two-dimensional Burgers problem in L-shaped irregular domain 
and the three-dimensional Burgers problem in irregular domain, have been analysed. 
The comparison of solution approximated by FD-LMPS and the analytical solution 
has given consisting result of high accuracy and good stability. The error distribution 
also has shown consistent behaviour of achieving better accuracy while using more 
global points and local points, and adding local points can even acquire better 
efficiency. Hereby we declare the proposed numerical model of FD-LMPS with 
Col-Hopf transformation is a promising tool for future researches and applications.

which followed the concept of integral quadrature. The conventional DQ method has 
advantages of the high accurate solution, however the requirement of the orthogonal 
grids and the disadvantages of full resultant matrix restrict its application. To 
overcome these difficulties, Shu et al. (2003) [14] provided the LRBFDQ method that 
the weighting coefficients are approached by RBFs [17, 18], thus the unstructured 
grids are also available. Moreover, the band-width of the resultant matrix becomes 
smaller by reducing the number of supporting nodes. Several works in recent years 
show that the LRBFDQ method is an efficient method, such as Shen et al. (2005) [21] 
and S. Soleimani, et al. (2010) [22]. 
In this article, we examine the applications of the LRBFDQ to solve the SWE. First, 
the formulations will be introduced before the application of numerical procedures in 
Section 2.2. The LRBFDQ is introduced in Section 2.3. In this section, the governing 
equations are discretized in spatial domain by LRBFDQ and temporal direction by 
FDM. Section 2.4 demonstrates three examples. In first and second case, our model is 
verified by comparing the results with analytical solutions and benchmark in articles; 
in the third case, we will employ our model to numerically analyze and discuss the 
inflow discharge of Yuanshantze Flood Diversion (YFD). Finally, conclusions and 
suggestions will be given based on our results. 
2.2. The 2D shallow-water model 
The shallow water equations (SWEs, which are also called the de Saint-Venant 
equations) are used to describe flow behaviors in bodies of water where the horizontal 
length scales are much greater than the flow depth (i.e., the long wavelength 
phenomena). Here we briefly review the 2D SWEs. 
A shallow-water flow region is illustrated in Fig. 2.1. By the assumption of the 
hydrostatic pressure and uniform velocity profile along the vertical direction, the 3D 
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations can be simplified to the 2D SWEs. In the 
primitive form, the governing equations including a continuity equation and a 
momentum equation in each of the x- and y-directions are shown as follows:

2.4.1. Case 2.1. Tidal wave problem 
A rectangular channel is illustrated in Fig. 2.3 with length L=872km and width 
W=50km. Inside the channel the fluid exists with water depth bh =20m initially. Now 
a wave-making source is located at the boundary 0x  and the others are given by land 
boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are given by

Based on the value of the water depth is relatively small to the scale of the rectangular 
channel, it is assumed that the governing equations are simplified as linear SWEs. In 
this case the numerical simulation of the water depth and horizontal velocity is made 
from time t = 0s to t = 43200s (12hr). To avoid the discontinuity for the wave made at 
starting, the initial conditions (2.15) are given from the analytical solution [13] of this 
linear shallow water equation as follows

By comparing with the other numerical methods such as CSRBF and global MQ 
method, our numerical experiments have shown that the LRBF-DQ method is more 
accurate as revealing in Table 2.2. This case has shown that the LRBFDQ method is 
suitable for linear SWEs, so we extend this method to non-linear SWEs in the next case.

2.4.2. Dam-break problem 
This problem models a partial dam-break for rapid opening of a sluice gate with a 
non-symmetric breach and its ability to simulate discontinuous flows. The 
computational domain is a 200m×200m region with frictionless bottom. A dam is 
located in the middle of the domain with 10m thickness. The initial water depth is 10m 
on one side and 5m on the other side of the dividing wall. At time 0t , the dam fails, 
and the water is released through the 75m wide non-symmetric breach, as shown in 
Fig. 2.5.

the YFD by 1.7 km is suggested in 2009 and 2010. In the conclusions, the article [32] 
suggests the stage-discharge rating curve established by this measurement and neglect 
the variation between the temporary bridge and YFD. However, the measured data 
during 2009 and 2010 is few and hence this rating curve may be still not adaptive for 
further application.  
To verify the rating curve of the second method, we employ our non-linear numerical 
model to simulate the flow in YFD for the instant the flood diversion is going to 
happen (That is, the water depth at CD should be 3.0 m). According to above 
information, the boundary conditions are given as follows:

Where the subscript of ,   and u v h denotes the location described in the Fig. 2.10 (a) 
of the physical value. 
It is noted that there are infinite set of solutions can satisfy above boundary conditions 
because the boundary conditions of velocity for both inflow and outflow are not given. 
Thus we employ the rating curve at EF  regressed from the data of physical-model 
experiment for the outflow discharge. The numerical model is stopped while the 
calculated outflow discharge at EF  is larger than it solved by the rating curve and 
then the corresponding inflow discharge can be calculated.

2.5. Conclusions 
In this study, the applied local meshless method – the localized radial-basis-function 
based differential quadrature (LRBFDQ) method can be applied to large computing 
and dealing with irregular domain for combining RBF. The LRBFDQ method has been 
verified by the analytical solutions and compared with other numerical methods. As our 
results, the LRBFDQ method has been successfully applied to the two-dimensional 
shallow water equations, including a tidal-wave problem governed by two-dimensional 
linear shallow-water equations (SWEs) and a classical dam-break problem governed by 
two-dimensional nonlinear SWEs. Results show good agreements with the results 
reported by other researches, even for dealing with water surface discontinuities. 
For further applications, our non-linear SWE model is also used to test the acceptability 
of the stage-discharge rating curve of the inflow discharge of the Yuanshantzu Flood 
Diversion (YFD) with domain in an irregular shape. As a result, the rating curve 
suggested in the report in 2009 and 2010 can provide close results to the numerical 
solution, however it may also underestimate the inflow discharge. It is convinced that 
the proposed model not only provides accurate result but also has applicability to do 
numerical analysis in engineering problem. In the further work, we plan to apply our 
SWE method to simulate unsteady flows in our next research.

numerical experiments in the literature, this method is verified to have several 
advantages: high accuracy, stable in nonlinear convergence, applicability in computing 
with a large amount of nodes, and easy to extend to higher dimensions. 
3.2. Numerical method 
The 1-D shallow-water equations with side-flows are shown as Eq. (3.1):

The Froude number is always less than 1 in this case, so the flow regime is the 
subcritical flow. That is, we need one boundary condition at the upstream and one at the 
downstream. The two boundary conditions can be chosen from Eq. (3.15).

Several numerical tests can be done by these analytical solutions. For the verification of 
the sensitivity of NL, the first case is set as L=10000 (m), 1t  (s), and T is 100 (s). 
The boundary conditions are given by the analytical solutions of u at both upstream and 
downstream in this case. The computational results with different NL for N=15 are 
shown in Fig. 3.1.

idea has not been considered by any other conventional interpolation methods. 
Furthermore, a method that combines the advantages of two aforementioned ones to 
further improve the accuracy is also proposed. The field gradient can be also 
determined accurately since an efficient derivative calculator based on the LRBF-DQ 
algorithm is also employed [Shen et al. (2011)].  
The current methods are applied to interpolate the data governed by the Poisson and 
advection-diffusion equations to demonstrate the performance. The numerical results 
show that the present interpolation techniques are outstanding in treating the problems 
whose gradient changes dramatically. 
4.2. Numerical scheme 
4.2.1. The formulations of the LRBF-DQ methods 
The essential idea of the DQ method is to approximate the function derivatives by the 
weighted sum of the function values at all points in the domain. Hence, the m
th
 order 
derivative along x direction of a function f(x) at x = xi can be expressed as

where N is the total number of global computational nodes, wij
(m)
 are the weighting 
coefficients. The next step is to assume that f(x) can be approximated by the linear 
combination of a set of basis functions j(x) (or test functions), such as the 
polynomials or the RBFs. According to the principle of superposition, all the basis 
functions should satisfied the basic idea of DQ. The weighting coefficients for the ith 
node can therefore be obtained by solving

In Bellman’s approach, the polynomials are chosen as the basis functions. Thus the 
method is mesh-dependent method and is confined to problem with regular domain 
and orthogonal girds. Furthermore, the resultant system matrix to be solved is highly 
ill-conditioned when the system is large. Wu and Shu [2002] then used several RBFs 
to replace the polynomials as the test functions, including the MQ, the General MQ 
局部化無網格數值方法於工程問題之研究 (100-2221-E-002-020-)

of the local weighting coefficients wij
(m)
. It is noted that the global matrix is in general 
a compact sparse matrix.  
4.2.2. Shape parameter of the multi-quadric function (MQ) 
The MQ is accurate and is proven to be exponential convergent [Franke (1982)], thus 
is employed as the test function to compute the weighting coefficients in this work. 
The MQ in two-dimensional space can be expressed as 
   
2 2
2
j j jx x y y c        (4.5)  
where the shape parameter, c, is adopted to avoid singular when the reference node 
overlaps the supporting note. 
To determine a proper shape parameter, an additional constrain is proposed by Tseng 
[2010], which states that the summation of the weighting coefficients of a set of local 
supporting nodes is zero. This constrain comes directly from the consideration of a 
constant function as an additional basis function. From Eq. (4.3), we obtain   
 

L
m
ij
N
j
w

 , for 1,  2,  , i N .  (4.6)  
In this work, the shape parameter is chosen when the computed weighting coefficients 
satisfy the above constrain.  
 
4.2.3.  Interpolation by the LRBF-DQ method 
In this section, we introduce how the LRBF-DQ is applied to the interpolation of 
scattered data. Two novel methods that utilize (I) the field gradient or (II) the 
governing equation are proposed, which different from the conventional interaction 
techniques that consider either the spatial distribution of the nodes or the field value 
only. To further improve the results, a method that contains the merits of the two 
aforementioned methods is presented and will be denoted by method (III).

The unknown point can be interpolated by the relative points, and the derivative of each relative point 
can be approximated by the local supporting point within the dashed line.

First, consider that there is an arbitrary point of unknown field value and NR relative 
points which are chosen as the first NR nearest points with given data. The square 
with index k and the solid circles in Fig. 4.2 are denoted as the unknown point and the

4.3. Results 
To demonstrate the capability of the presented interpolation techniques, a set of 
sparsely distributed nodes with given data are used to interpolate the unknown field 
value of another denser mesh in the same domain. The given data are obtained from 
the exact solution of the Poisson equation or the advection-diffusion equation. In 
method (I), the field gradient in x-, y- and z-directions are employed separately for 
interpolation and are denoted as method (I)-x, (I)-y and (I)-z, respectively. The 
performances of the current methods are compared with the conventional ones, 
including the linear polynomial fitting (LPF) method and the quadratic polynomial 
fitting (QPF) method. The algorithms of the aforementioned interpolation methods are 
shown in Table 4.1.

and is portrayed in Fig. 4.4. It is shown in the figure that the field gradient is large 
near the boundary and small toward the center. As shown in Fig. 4.5, two sets of nodal 
distributions of 2485, 4385 points are considered. Their field values are computed by 
the exact solution Eq. (4.12) and are employed to interpolate the data at 8480 
unknown points as shown in the same figure.

Figure 4.5:  The nodal distributions of 2485, 4385 data and 8480 unknown points 
The results interpolated from 4385 points by method (I)-x, (I)-y, (I)-z, (II) and (III) 
with 7 relative points and the 13 local supporting points are displayed in Fig. 4.6. As 
shown in the figure, the LPF and the QPF methods cannot describe the field properly, 
especially near the boundary where the field gradient along radial direction is large. 
On the other hand, the current interpolation methods all give more reasonable results. 
It is noted that the results by method (I)-x, (I)-y and (I)-z are similar since the exact 
solution and the problem domain are spherical symmetric. For quantitative 
comparison, the maximum absolute error (MAXE) which is obtained by the 
maximum absolute difference between the exact solution and the numerical solution 
and the root mean squares error (RMSE) for each method are provided in Table 4.2. 
The root mean squares error (RMSE) is defined as 
 

 (4.13)  
where M is the number of the unknown points. Diminishing error with increasing 
number of data points is observed for each case. The results by the present 
interpolation methods all show better accuracy than those by either the LPF or the 
QPF method. In particular, the results by method (II) and (III) are even better than 
those by method (I). Since the results may be over-estimated when violently varying 
field gradient is adopted for interpolation.  
From Table 4.2, method (III) seems to provide a more reliable solution, thus the error 
analysis under different numbers of the relative points, NR, and the local support 
nodes, NL, are shown in Fig. 4.7. The number of the local support knots and the

Figure 4.8:  The schematic sketch and the exact solution of the advection-diffusion 
equation problem 
In this problem, two sets of different given data points are used to interpolate 3982 
mesh points as shown in Fig. 4.9.  Fig. 4.10 shows the numerical results obtained by 
the five proposed methods as well as the LPF and the QPF methods using 2046 given 
data points. Qualitatively, the contours by the proposed methods are all smoother than 
those by other two conventional methods. To give a quantitative error study, the MAXE 
and the RMSE of the results by different methods are also given in Table 4.3 for two 
different numbers of given data (1115 and 2046 data points). Since the exact solution 
and the problem domain are axisymmetric, the result by method (I)-x is similar to those 
by method (I)-y. Among the results by the methods employing the field gradient, the 
result by method (I)-z is better than those by the other two. As observed from the 
contour plot in the Fig. 4.8(b), the temperature varies more severely in x- and 
y-directions than in z-direction. Thus, consideration of the derivative along z-direction 
for interpolation can avoid the over-fitting behavior as explained in the previous section. 
Methods (II) and (III) also show good performance, the employment of the governing 
equation for interpolation will effectively reduce the over-fitting problem even the 
second order derivative exists in the governing equation.

4.4. Conclusions 
In this paper, a new interpolation method based on the LRBF-DQ method is 
introduced, which employs the field gradient or the governing equations to interpolate 
the unknown data. The interpolated data therefore satisfy the geometric or the 
physical properties. Additionally, a method satisfied geometric and physical condition 
simultaneously, named method (III) in this study, is an optimum choice when 
interpolating data. From the numerical results of two testing problems, Poisson and 
advection-diffusion equations, the presented methods based on the LRBF-DQ scheme 
are capable in the interpolation, and have more accurate and robust results than those 
given by either the LPF or the QPF methods. Moreover, the error comparison of 
interpolation results are also shown to validate the performances of the method (III) 
under the different number of relative points (NR) and local support knots (NL). The 
range of adequate number of local supporting knots will change with the applied 
problem. Furthermore, the interpolation considering small field gradient can obtain 
the more accurate interpolation results such as the statistic errors of the last testing 
problem.

International Conference report during the funding period 
of 2011/8/1 to 2012/10/31 by Professor Der Liang Young 
 
I have attended one significant international conference during the research period 
of the past year. The details are listed as follows: 
In 2012, I have attended the Inter-Noise 2012, Innovations in Practical Noise Control, 
August 19-22, 2012, NY, USA. I orally presented a technical paper which was 
collected in the conference proceedings appearing as: 
 
Young, D.L., Wu, C.S. 2012, Frequency Responses for Vibroacoustic Problems by 
the Method of Fundamental Solutions, Inter-Noise 2012, Innovations in Practical 
Noise Control, August 19-22, 2012, NY,USA. 
 
This paper was generated from the NSC research funding. The presented paper was 
well received. Besides the conference presentation this related paper has been 
submitted and published in the significant SCI journal of Computational Mechanics 
which is with very high impact factor. The conference is a very big international 
conference and I am the third time to be invited to present our paper to the global 
international scholars. Thanks to the NSC supports, we thereby were able to make this 
expensive trip possible. It is highly recommended that NSC should support more 
distinguished scholars to present their research results to the international 
communities through the participation of important international conferences.
