inert atmosphere accelerates the aging process 
[9]. The decreases in the permeability are 
induced mainly by decreases in diffusivity. It 
was suggested [11] that this phenomenon is 
caused primarily by the changes of the 
morphology of polymer samples that is by 
decreases in free volume of PTMSP. Recent 
studies have shown that physical aging 
apparently proceeds much faster in thin 
polymer films with thicknesses in the order of 
selective layers of industrially used membranes 
than in observed in thick membranes [13-17]. 
This thought-provoking phenomenon has led to 
the hypothesis of processes for thickness 
dependent free volume elimination. 
Simultaneous free volume diffusion and lattice 
contraction mechanisms have been suggested to 
explain these observations. Free volume and 
segmental relaxation are the main structural 
features involved in the diffusion mechanism. 
Only lately, attention is being paid to the effect 
of physical aging on the gas transport 
properties, mainly the effect on permeability, 
diffusivity, and permselectivity. Studies have 
been performed on polycarbonate [18], 
polyvinyl chloride [19], and polyimide [20]. It 
is generally found that aging diminishes the 
permeation rates of many polymers, which is 
attributed to the decrease in free volume. 
EXPERIMENT 
Materials and membrane preparation 
Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (Mw: 
996000(GPC)) was supplied by the Aldrich 
Chemical Co.. Commercially available methyl 
isobutyl ketone (MIBK) was used as solvent 
without further purification. The concentration 
of the casting solution is PMMA /Methyl 
Isobutyl Ketone = 15/85(w/w). The solution 
was cast on a flat glass at room temperature and 
humidity was lower than 55%. After solvent 
evaporation, membranes were floated off the 
plate with deionized water. The membranes 
were dried at room temperature overnight, and 
removed to the vacuum oven dried at room 
temperature for 24 h. To remove the residue 
solvent the membranes were allowed to 
vacuum dried at 80oC for 24 h, finally annealed 
in oven at 150oC for 1.5h , which is well above 
the Tg =110oC. After annealing above the Tg at 
150oC, the films were quickly removed from 
the oven to quench the polymer which is 
assumed to be t =0 for all aging considerations. 
ß-transition temperature test 
The ß transition temperature was measured 
using a Perkin–Elmer DMA7e dynamic 
mechanical analyzerr and at a heating rate of 
50C/min. 
Glass transition temperature 
The physical aging of gas separation 
polymeric membrane has been studied 
extensively using a variety of methods, 
including permeation and sorption and various 
viscoelastic and thermal techniques. However, 
a definitive picture, or a free volume method, 
has not yet emerged. From a microscopic point 
of view, free volume plays a main role in 
polymeric membrane aging process, since the 
segmental mobility itself strongly depends on 
this property, namely, the mobility decreases 
with decreasing free volume. One of the 
objectives in the present study is report a direct 
relationship between the physical aging and the 
free volume hole size and hole size distribution 
probed by o-Ps in a poly(methyl methacrylate) 
membrane. The other is to gain insight into the 
real physical aging (aged at room temperature 
for 18 months) mechanism through the 
systematic study of permeability, sorptivity, 
transition temperature, and free volume. 
The glass transition temperature was 
measured using a Perkin–Elmer DSC-7 
differential scanning calorimeter and at a 
heating rate of 200C/min. 
Permeation study 
A gas permeation analyzer (Yanaco GTR10) 
was used to measure the pure gas permeability 
coefficients of the polymeric membranes for O2, 
N2, and CO2. The tests were carried out under 
isothermal conditions at 35 ℃  (±0.5 ℃ ). 
Permeability is usually expressed in barrer 
(10-10 (cm3 (STP) cm)/(cm2 s cmHg)). The 
ideal selectivity was calculated based on the 
ratio of permeability coefficients: 
B
A
BA P
P=/α  
where PA and PB are the permeability 
coefficient of pure gases A and B. The gas 
sorption measurements were made using a 
microbalance (Cahn model D202 
Electrobalance) to determine the amount of gas  
permeability decrease dramatic with the 
increasing aging time, and slowly decrease with 
increasing aging time after 40 days. The result 
is consistent with the measurement in the DMA, 
DSC and solubility in the membrane. It can be 
described as the free volume disappeared from 
the membrane due to the relaxation of the 
polymer chain.

CONCLUSION 
The motion of polymer chain in the 
membrane which makes the fractional free 
volume disappeared from the membrane 
dominates the physical aging phenomenon. 
From dynamic mechanical properties 
measurement, the relaxation of the polymer 
chain and sub chain mobility quite outstanding 
when the aging time less than 40 days. This 
implied that free volume quickly lost in initial 
aging stage. 
  The effect of physical aging on the gas 
separation properties of PMMA membranes 
was studied by monitoring the time evolution 
of the permeability and solubility to gases. The 
solubility and diffusivity decrease with aging 
time. These changes are believed to be the 
result of a decrease in polymer free volume.
