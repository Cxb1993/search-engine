報告內容 
前言、目的、文獻探討 
Since dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was developed, it has drawn much attention 
because of its simple fabrication process, low cost, and high conversion efficiency (η). 
DSSC was first developed by Tsubomura and Matsumura using aluminum-doped 
ZnO electrodes [1]. Although the photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) was not too 
high (about 2.5%), the development of DSSC is still an interesting research topic. A 
typical DSSC consists of four components, including (1) anode (electrode), (2) 
nano-crystalline (TiO2 layer), (3) counter electrode, and (4) liquid electrolyte between 
the two electrodes [2, 3]. The configuration of DSSC is often formed with a special 
sandwich structure. To commercialize the DSSC devices, it is need to improve the 
formation skill to achieve relatively longer lifetime and higher η. By increasing the 
surface area of anode is one of the effective approaches to improve the η.  
In 1988, Prof. Grätzel developed a new solar cell by using nano-porous TiO2 film to 
form the working electrode be sensitized using the Ru-complex dye [4-6]. Among 
many materials for the anode fabrication, the n-type semiconductor titanium dioxide 
(TiO2) with nanostructure is usually adopted because of its nanoporous nature [7, 8], 
which exhibits a relatively larger surface area than TiO2 film [9, 10]. TiO2 has many 
unique characteristics, such as high photocatalytic activities, chemical and thermal 
stability and a wide band-gap (~3.2 eV).  
The mixture of P25 (TiO2 nanoparticles) and TTIP (Titanium (IV) isopropoxide) is 
one of the most common approaches for the preparation of nanoporous TiO2 [11, 12]. 
The large surface area which the nanoporous TiO2 exhibits is an essential requirement 
for dye adsorption. On the other hand, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 
by Iijima [13], have attracted great interest due to their special physical and chemical 
properties [14, 15]. Because of the good electrical conductivity, thermal stability [16], 
it was also reported to be used to combine with the mixture of P25 and TTIP as the 
anode material [17, 18]. The DSSCs with such a fabricated anode has a relatively high 
η. Nevertheless, this kind of the DSSC was assembled by utilizing random CNTs with 
the P25 and TTIP composite [19-21]. CNTs have two main surface morphologies: 
random CNTs [22] and vertically aligned CNTs (VACNTs) [23, 24]. Between them, 
it is easier to control the length and calculate the number density of VACNTs. The 
usable surface area of VACNT is also larger than that of random CNTs. Therefore, 
VACNTs is more suitable than random CNTs in DSSC applications. In this study, we 
use the VACNT bundles as a template to let the TiO2 nanoparticles attach and offer a 
suitable conduction path for electrons transportation in the application of DSSC. The 
nanoporous TiO2 nanoparticles were attached on the VACNT bundles surface to 
improve the η.

結果與討論 
To investigate the influences on the surface morphologies of VACNT bundles 
with different TTIP concentrations, SEM was used to characterize the surface 
morphologies of the formed anodes. Figures 3(a)-3(f) show the SEM images of 
VACNT bundles grown on the stainless steel substrates with various TTIP 
concentrations. The inset in each image shows the enlarge SEM image. Fig. 2(a) 
shows a SEM image of pristine VACNT bundles grown on stainless steel substrate. 
According to the configuration of mesh, the shape of the synthesized VACNT bundle 
was cuboid. The length of bottom side was about 60 nm. Each bundle contained 
VACNTs with a high number density of about 109 cm-2. The length of the pristine 
VACNT bundles was about 80 nm. Because the pristine VACNT bundles were 
synthesized on the stainless steel substrate directly, it can be observed that the pristine 
VACNT bundles exhibited good adhesion to the stainless steel substrate. Figures 
3(b)-3(f) show a series of SEM images with various TTIP concentrations of 0.018, 
0.036, 0.054, 0.072, 0.090 M, respectively. It can be observed that when the 
concentration of TTIP was increased from 0.018 to 0.072 M, the connection among 
TiO2 nanoparticles was improved gradually. On the other hand, when the TTIP 
concentration was higher than 0.072 M, the TiO2 nanoparticles started to aggregate, 
that is, the surface morphology in this situation was uneven. Therefore, in this study, 
from the surface morphology observation by SEM, when the TTIP concentration was 
0.072 M, an uninterrupted TiO2 thin film was formed, which offered an optimal 
conduction path for electrons transportation in DSSC application.  
To confirm the nanoparticles on the surface of the VACNT bundle surface were 
TiO2, the XRD measurement system was utilized. Figure 4 shows the XRD spectrum 
of the VACNTs, which was coated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The angle of 25.1o 
corresponded to the (101) plane represents the anatase structure of TiO2. The angles, 
27.3o and 47.9 o were assigned to (101) and (200) planes, respectively, represent the 
TiO2 rutile structure. The other planes, designed with SUS, were from the stainless 
sheet. As a result, from the XRD spectrum results, the nanoparticles were TiO2, and 
the TiO2 nanopaticles coated on the VACNT bundles in this work were the mixture of 
the anatase and rutile structures.  
To realize the relationship between the η and TTIP concentration, the η, open 
circuit, short circuit current, and fill factor (FF) under different TTIP concentrations 
were measured and summarized in Table 1. Figure 5(a) shows the J-V curve, and Fig. 
4(b) shows the relationship between the TTIP concentration and η, respectively. It can 
be found that the η has a relatively high value at the TTIP solution concentration of 
0.072 M. It was because that compared with the other TTIP concentrations, when the 
TTIP concentration was 0.072 M, this concentration of TTIP made TiO2 nanoparticles

Keywords: Supercapacitor, Carbon nanotubes, Nitrogen content, Ruthenium dioxide 
 
The supercapacitor, also known as an ultra-capacitor or 
electrochemical capacitor, has attracted considerable 
attentions due to its high power density, high energy 
density, and long cycle life [1]. Electric double layer 
capacitor (EDLC) and pseudo-capacitor are two forms 
of supercapacitor to store electrical energy. Among the 
structure of EDLC, the electrode plays an important 
role on the performance of EDLC.  
Multi-walled vertically aligned carbon nanotubes 
(VACNTs) are extremely suitable for use as EDLC 
electrodes because of their good electrical conductivity, 
large effective surface area, and highly regular structure. 
To enhance the performance of EDLCs, some 
functional atoms [2] and oxides [3] such as nitrogen and 
ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) are attached on the surface of 
the electrodes to improve the charge-exchange 
behaviour of VACNTs. In this study, we deposited 
RuO2 nanorods on nitrogen-doped VACNTs to 
investigate the characteristics of the supercapacitors.   
The nitrogen-doped VACNTs were grown, using 
the thermal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) system, 
on stainless sheets. C2H2 and NH3 was used the carbon 
and nitrogen sources during the VACNTs growth, 
respectively. The RuO2 nanorods were synthesized on 
the nitrogen-doped VACNTs by metal organic CVD. 
Figure 1 shows the capacitance curves of pristine 
VACNTs, nitrogen-doped VACNTs, RuO2/VACNTs, 
and RuO2/nitrogen-doped VACNTs electrodes in 
different concentrations of KOH electrolyte. It reveals 
that the addition of RuO2 nanorods to nitrogen-doped 
VAVNTs surface could efficiently increase the 
capacitance due to the pseudo-capacitor performance 
and increased surface area from the growth of the RuO2 
nanorod structure. 
From the results, the nitrogen-doping and RuO2 
nanorods attachment on VACNTs could effectively 
enhance the characteristics of EDLC. More details of 
the research will be presented at the conference.
