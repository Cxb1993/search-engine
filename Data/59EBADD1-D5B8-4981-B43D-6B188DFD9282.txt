priority dispatching rule in the order 
releasing stage produced good performance 
in average flowtimes.  Guide and Spencer 
[8] presented a resource-planning model with 
consideration of material recovery rate and 
stochastic routings.  Guide et al. [9] 
discussed the scheduling issues in a 
shop-floor control perspective.  Kasmara et 
al. [12] used an integer-programming model 
that included the information of sales and 
returns in each period with the objective 
function as maximization of profits.  
Ketzenberg et al. [13] studied the effect of 
average flowtime with having dedicated 
disassembly line or mixed assembly line for 
both assembly and disassembly operations. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
Some research focused on the planning 
for the disassembly process only.  Taleb and 
Gupta [16] addressed on the scheduling of 
the product disassembly with part/material 
commonality and provide a scheduling 
mechanism to determine the total 
disassembly requirement as well as the time 
to release along the planning horizon.  
Langella [15] developed an 
integer-programming model for the 
disassembly planning when a returned 
product can be consumed by remanufacturing, 
stored for future demand, or simply disposed.  
However, the given disassembly sequence 
might not be the most cost efficient.  The 
optimal disassembly sequence for individual 
EOL product was evaluated in Gungor and 
Gupta [6] among different disassembly 
strategies for that product with a set of 
precedence relationship among 
subassemblies, or a disassembly precedence 
graph.  The disassembly sequences were 
generated with the consideration of the 
uncertainty in the defects of the returning 
products. 
Demands in regular assembly can be 
collected in advance.  When demand is 
given and the production process is known, 
the required resources can be planed and 
scheduled along the time horizon.  But in 
the disassembly process, the variance in 
quantity and quality of returned products is 
so huge that it fails to fit in with any 
available planning scheme.  The EoL 
production planning can only begin when the 
optimal disassembly sequences are found 
with a given demand as well as a set of 
quantity and quality of returned products.  
The disassembly sequences carry the 
information of resources, processes, parts, 
and schedules. 
This EoL production planning design is 
considered flexible due to the frequent 
updates whenever disassembly demand 
changes.  The optimal disassembly 
sequence is generated with either fixed or 
changeable the dismantle levels of returned 
products depend on the demands of repair or 
remanufacturing.  Since the disassembly 
level is not fixed, the disassembly 
optimization allows partial disassembly. 
For any original equipment 
manufacturer (OEM), which has the capacity 
to perform both assembly and disassembly 
operations, it can integrate part of the key 
components of its returned products with 
their forward production as in Figure 1. The 
business opportunities that have mutually 
benefits to the environment in this integrated 
supply chain are the resale and the reuse of 
those returned assets [3]. 
Disassembly is the process of 
dismantling a product through successive 
steps at the end of its life so as to recover 
useful components or subassemblies, for 
resale, reuse, or proper disposal. A product, 
as a whole, may not be repairable at the end 
of its conventional useful life, yet there might 
be components and subassemblies that are in 
good enough condition for use in a new 
product or in the remanufacture of an old one 
[2]. The efficient retrieval of these 
parts/subassemblies will not only cut down 
the production cost, but will also reduce the 
associated disposal costs and, consequently, 
the environmental hazards. It is clear that in 
order to retrieve these useful components and 
subassemblies from a product, the process of 
disassembly has to be conducted in such a 
manner that the benefits resulting from 
reusing these parts and subassemblies 
outweigh the combined costs of the 
disassembling and disposal of the entire 
product.

for each product type is known prior to the 
optimization of that period. Each product 
type has its own feasible disassembly 
sequence but might use the same disassembly 
operations and result in same subparts as 
other product types. For the sellable subparts, 
the sell price depends only on the type of 
subparts even if they are retrieved from 
different product types.

This SPDO model is an extension of the 
multi-commodity network flow model with 
multiple initial assemblies and final 
subassemblies of each product type, or 
multiple sources and multiple targets of each 
commodity. Consider an AND/OR graph G  
with V  nodes and E  arcs, a collection of 
K  commodities is to send a 
multi-commodity flow on G  with a 
capacity restriction u  on E . Each 
commodity k has a specific set of source 
nodes  and target nodes , for k0I
k
fI Kk  . 
Since the total flow sent from the set of 
source nodes  can be different from the 
total flow received at the set of target nodes 
 for some commodity 
kI 0
k
fI k , the total 
demand is loosely bound with the maximum 
supply , for ks Kk  .  
The objective is to maximize total profit 
as shown in equation (1). Constraint sets 
(2) – (4) are the flow balance constraints 
where the maximum inflow from each 
product type k  is limited to the maximum 
supply ,  ks Kk  . Operations are shared 
for all product types and the capacity 
limitation is indicated in constraint set (5). 
Non-negativity constraint set (6) enforces on 
the number of operations required only. 
 
4. Numerical Results 
 
A numerical example is used here to 
demonstrate how this SPDO can provide 
optimal partial disassembly sequence for 
each type of products. Here we consider two 
product types, and the disassembly tree for 
both product types is shown as in Figure 3. 
Here it is assumed that all returns are all 
re-sellable, which the sell price for sellable 
subparts are $5 each, and the unit cost for 
each operation is $1. The optimal solutions 
under different scenarios are summarized as 
in Table 1. Suppose  be the sell price for some

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
A product family is defined as a set of individual products that share common technology and address a related set of market 
applications [1]. The key to design an effective product family is platform based product development where platform variants are 
derived by augmenting the common core of the product in one or more dimensions to target specific market niches [2]. In general, 
platform based mass customization practices have been grouped into two broad classifications viz., module based product families and 
scale based serialization of product families [3]. Several works on scale based serialization existing in literature have been classified into 
various benchmark problems by Allada et al. [19] which included a case study of pressure vessels. The product platform design problem 
for a pressure vessel was studied in Hernandez et al. [4]. They utilized the Product Platform Constructal Theory Method (PPCTM) to 
solve the problem via deterministic methods. The concept of uncertainty in design was introduced by Carone et al. [5] by finding a 
tradeoff between cost and variety. Williams [6] and Williams et al. [7] argued that the demand scenarios as being non-uniform in nature 
and attacked the problem using an augmented PPCTM approach. They modeled the problem as a Multistage Utility-Based Compromise 
Decision Support Problem (u-cDSP) and thereafter solved it using an exhaustive search technique (deterministic method). Kulkarni et al. 
[8] considered both assumptions of non-uniform and uncertainty demand, and provided a tradeoff between profit and deviation in profit 
due to fluctuation in demand. 
In recent studies, there has been extensive use of artificial intelligence techniques for the optimization of computationally complex 
problems, such as Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and Tabu Search.. These algorithms are marked by their short response times 
and high quality solutions especially when the problem size is large. The algorithm selection problem consists of choosing the best 
algorithm from a predefined set to run on the given problem instance [9]. The problem has been utilized by many researchers using both 
high-knowledge classification approach and low-knowledge control of optimization algorithms. Lagoudakis and Litman [10] used 
Markov decision process with reinforcement learning applied to algorithm control. Boyan and Moore [11] attempted to correlate problem 
features with search performances in an effort to improve the searching procedure. Carchare and Beck [12] applied machine learning 
approach and introduced term “low-knowledge control” for optimizing scheduling problems. In this research, the authors define relative 
improvement factors for each pure algorithm during runtime and thereby propose a realtime, optimization-based strategy for algorithm 
selection to further improve solutions for the product platform planning problem.

technique plays a crucial role in determining the solution quality. However, it requires a significant human expertise to select the best 
suited algorithm for a given problem instance [12]. To circumvent the need of this expertise, the authors propose a realtime optimization 
based strategy that orients itself adaptively to select the best suited algorithm in each iteration. 
In general, superiority of a search strategy is judged by its relative performance over other metaheuristics by the principal of faster 
computation time or better solution quality [9]. However, an algorithm producing better results on one problem instance may not 
guarantee to produce similar results in all other cases. Therefore, any single optimization strategy may not prove itself to be versatile 
enough for having universal applicability in terms of generating better averaged results. Thus, the algorithm selection and control poses 
an issue of significant relevance in current optimization technology. In view of above considerations, the authors propose an adaptive 
method for allocation of computational resources among a set of algorithms to achieve a superior performance on the product platform 
problem with variable customer demand. The algorithm selection problem consists of choosing the best algorithm from a predefined set 
to run on the underlying problem [9]. The approach does not rely upon any complex prediction model (either on problem domain or on 
algorithm behavior) and is capable of achieving the performance equivalent to a high knowledge classification approach. In the proposed 
technique, the metaheuristics compete with each other for both their selection and control. The crux of employing the realtime 
optimization based technique to the pressure vessel design problem is twofold; demonstrating the application of the proposed strategy on 
the underlying problem and achieving proximity of results towards global optimum.  
Given a time limit T, the realtime optimization based technique ranks each algorithm during runtime in the order in which they have to 
operate on the problem instance. The time T is further broken into a short forecast phase (tf) and control phase (tc) such that, 
T = tf + tc       (6) 
The forecast phase (tf) predicts which algorithm should be utilized for remaining of the control time T-tf = tc. We represent the 
information flow within the real-time optimization based strategy as shown in the Figure 2. Al(rl, tl), $ %1,2,3l& , represents an algorithm 
from the predefines set, rl and tl being its corresponding rank and time for which the algorithm runs during the forecast phase. Aw is the 
winner algorithm that is predicted to perform better in the control phase and tw is the time for which it is run. It is clear from Figure 2 that 
tw=tc. The winner algorithm amongst the three is decided by the Relative Improvement Factor (RIFl) calculated during the forecast phase 
via a realtime algorithm selection procedure. 
The random search techniques respond sensitively to the initial feasible solution presented to them. This is why averaged result (for 
numerous random seeds) is provided when these stochastic search metaheuristics are applied to any problem instance. The bottom line 
behind employing the realtime optimization based search strategy is to forecast which metaheuristic (from a given set) will perform better 
during the control phase where most of the computational time is allotted to the processor. In order to circumvent the loss of computations 
carried out during the forecasting phase, the results produced by one algorithm is passed on directly to the other algorithm sequentially. 
Instead of computing absolute improvement in results for each algorithm over a common static population, a relative improvement factor 
(RIFk) is utilized over a dynamic population received by previous algorithm. This RIFk is derived mathematically according to,

increases the problem complexity and search space both and thus paves the way for development of an optimization scheme which 
progressively orients itself to select best algorithm amongst a set of algorithm. 
5.2 PARAMETER SETTINGS AND COMPARISON OF RESULTS
The proposed algorithm is coded in C++ and compiled on GNU C++ Compiler (GCC) using KDevelop on a Linux platform. The 
compiled program is run on a system specification of 2.13 GHz (Core2Duo) with 4GB RAM. Ten problem instances were generated with 
due considerations to the non-uniformity of demand within the market space. In order to verify the ability of the proposed methodology to 
handle any kind of non uniform demand in a fixed market space, we have selected ten demand scenarios derived from three basic ones, 
viz. discrete changes in demand, linear changes in demand and normal distribution of demand. A brief synopsis of the demand scenarios 
has been outlined in Figure 1. For each demand scenario, the values of the following three variables have to be calculated, viz. thickness 
of shell plate ( Ts ), thickness of head plate ( Th ) and radius of shell and head ( R ). The entire market place is further defined by the 
101 P , 302 P , 101 V , and 302 V . Moreover, the radius ( R ) and length ( L ) is limited to be within 1.5 and 7 for each pressure 
vessel variant.  
The best results obtained by the proposed search technique are reported in Table 1 below.

The characteristic and search capability of proposed realtime optimization based technique is compared against the individual pure 
algorithms on the NL-demand scenario. To provide detailed insights and to estimate the corresponding convergence trends, the best 
fitness values obtained from the individual pure algorithms and the proposed search technique is plotted against total number of fitness 
evaluations as shown in Figure 4.  
Similarly, Table 2 presents the averaged results obtained after 10 runs of each search strategy over all the problem instances. The 
results of evaluation clearly state the superiority of the proposed strategy over pure algorithms by consistently providing better results on 
the underlying problem. 
5. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS
The objective of this research is to portray the efficacy of the proposed realtime optimization based approach in the product platform 
planning. The research investigated the problem of offering a range of customized product variants in non-uniform market demand from 
the manufacturers’ perspective. A four variable pressure vessel problem (categorized as A2/B2) in a fixed market space with variable 
customer demand has been undertaken in an attempt to maximize the average profit of all the product variants in entire market space. Ten 
problem instances were generated using ten different demand scenarios and the proposed optimization approach was tested over them. In 
essence, the current work augments the previous literature on product platform planning problem with pressure vessels as a case study in 
two ways (i) by proposing a new flexible encoding scheme for adequately incorporating non-uniform demand scenarios and (ii) by 
applying a realtime optimization based approach for selection of the best stochastic search metaheuristic on the underlying problem.
