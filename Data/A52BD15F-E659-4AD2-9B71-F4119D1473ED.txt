epoxy resin limits its further application in today’s microelectronic era.  
Miniaturization of devices requires lower dielectric materials for
intermetallic dielectrics and packaging. Although incorporating POSS
molecule into epoxy resin is a possible way to reduce dielectric constant
and dissipation factor, while reduction in gel fraction and glass transition
of material are inevitable drawbacks. On the other hands, although BT
resin is a permissible material for packaging application the resin curing
is still a problem. In view of literature search polymers containing
siloxane are able to not only enhance thermal stability and toughness
but also to reduce dielectric constant[1~5]. Our previous study on
siloxane and imide containing epoxy appears to be another possibility for
electronic application as it shows good mechanical performance and
lower dielectric constant[6]. Our previous study on siloxane and imide
containing BT resin co-cured with epoxy resin suggests a possible
improvement of mechanical properties as well as electric property[7].
Therefore, in this study of another epoxy/ BT resin co-cured system,
further modification of the epoxy curing agent I by incorporating siloxane
and imide groups might be able to further improve properties for
possible microelectronic application.
EXPERIMENTAL
ratio of 1:1 with addition of Cobalt(III) acetylacetonate (0.5 % on II) and
4-noyl phenol (1 % on II) as catalyst for this BT resin. Various
equivalent ratios of epoxy/BT resin in 100/0、97/3、95/5、90/10、80/20 ,
together with the diamine I (in same equivalent of epoxy) were
blended and pre-cured at 140 oC for 1 hours, cured at 200 oC for 2hours,
and finally post-cured at 250 oC for 6 hours.
Instruments
FTIR spectra were obtained from Avatar 360 FT-IR (Nicolet Co.)
with a resolution of 1 cm-1. Dynamic differential scanning calorimeter
(DSC) thermograms were performed with Seiko Instrument DSC 200
under 100ml/min of nitrogen flow with heating rates of 3, 5, 10 and 15
oC/min. Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and thermomechanical
analyzer (TMA) thermograms were performed with Du Pont TA 2950 and
2940 with a heating rate of 10 oC/min. Samples with dimension of 4 x 1
x 0.2 cm were tested with dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) at 1 Hz
with a heating rate of 3 oC/min., temperature ranging from 30 to 300 oC.
Dielectric constants of cured samples were measured with a DEA Du Pont
2970 dielectric analyzer at 1MHz.
RESULTS and DISCUSSIONS
Dynamic DSC
with catalysts and curing agent is coated on KBr plate and mounted on
the FTIR cell at 250 o C. Sample was scanned at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100
and 120 mins. with a resolution of 1 cm-1. A series of successive FTIR
absorbance spectra are shown in Figure 2, and the difference
absorbance spectra (At –Ao, t in mins.) are given in Figure 3. Detailed
data for the absorbance increase (+) or decrese (-) associated with the
corresponding functional groups are given in Table 1. The characteristic
absorptions for epoxy (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A) are 1455 cm-1(δC-H
bending vib.), 1248cm-1(δC-O stretching vib.), 1184 cm-1(δC-O-C stretching
vib.), 910 cm-1 ( epoxy ring stretching vib.), etc..Those of cyanate ester
are 2278 and 2238cm-1(δC≡N bending vib.), 1382 cm-1(δC-H bending vib.),
1199 and 1172 cm-1(δC-O stretching vib.). When cyanate ester co-cured
with epoxy, continuous decreasing with time for absorbance at 910 cm-1
(epoxy ring)，2278 cm-1 and 2238 cm-1 (ν C≣N) were found. On the
other hands, Gradual increasing absorbance at 1565 cm-1 (triazine，ν 
C=N), 1382 cm-1 (alkyl isocyanurate ， ν C-N) and 1763 cm-1
(oxazolidinone，ν C=O) were also observed.  It can be inferred that 
trimerization of cyanate ester, leading to the formation of aryl cyanurate
(a structure of triazine), which further reacted with epoxy yielding alkyl
isocyanurate (1382 cm-1). New absorbance gradually occured at 1763
cm-1 (ν C=O) and continuous decreasing absorbance at 910 m-1 (epoxy
ring) support the reaction of alkyl isocyanurate with
epoxy forming oxazolidinone structure, as reported in literature[9~13].
This finding confirms that trimerization occurred earlier before the
disappearance of epoxy which is believed due to the next subsequent
reaction between epoxy and aryl isocyanurate, forming oxazolidinone, as
mentioned above. In a comparison of the dynamic DSC thermograms
in Figure 1, the first exothermic peak at 146 oC is no doubt due to the
trimerization of cyanate ester to form aryl cyanurate. The second broad
exothermic peak at 190 oC is due to the subsequent reaction of aryl
cynaurate with epoxy to form alkyl isocyanurate, which further reacted
with epoxy to form oxazolidinone. After this stage nearly all epoxy was
used up and little epoxy left. This accounts for the disappearance of
the third peak at 212 oC for the samples B, C, D, and E. It appears
reasonable to infer that the co-cured material contains all those
complicated structures in the networks.
Co-cured samples were extracted continuously with acetone for
three days in Soxhlet extractors. The gel fractions of samples are listed
in Table 2. It seems as more BT resin is blended into epoxy the fraction
becomes lower. This phenomenon is probably in part, due to a series of
complicated curing reaction in the second stage (the second broad peak
at 190 oC) in dynamic DSC thermograms (Figure 1), complicated
networks existed in the bulk would certainly produce sterically
hindered environment, where some of the prepolymers of low molecular
weight left in the matrix and were extracted.

A 100/0 94.3
B 97/3 94.1
C 95/5 94.0
D 90/10 91.1
E 80/20 88.4
Thermal Stability
TGA thermograms of samples are given in Figure 4 and the
temperature of on-set of 5 % weight loss and char yields at 650 oC are
listed in Table 3.
Temperatures for 5 % weight loss are all above 320 oC. It appears
that increasing BT resin content in the blend would lead to a decrease of
the temperature of 5% weight loss. This tendency is consistent with
the trend of gel fraction (Table 2). As mentioned, the second stage of
curing involving several reactions which produce several complicated
structures in the strically hindered networks. Samples containing the
more BT resin would also contain more uncured small molecular
oligomers trapped in the matrix. These small oligomer are easier to
decompose and pyrolyzed. On the contrary samples containing more
BT resin produce higher char yield. This finding is also consistent with
the previous report[8]. Silica as a pyrolysis product of siloxane, the
thermally stable imide group in the BT resin, and the stable triazine and/
or oxaolidinone as the co-cured structures account for the finding.
Coefficient of Thermal expansion (CTE)
TMA thermograms of samples are shown in Figure 5. Values of
CTE can be read from the slope of the thermogram before Tg. They are
Table 4. CTE of samples before Tg.

6.  It is noted that samples B, C, D, and E show two Tg’s, presumably the 
two respective components are partially incompatible. It is also noted
that the more BT resin the sample contains, the lower Tg’s the sample 
has because of the more rubbery and flexible siloxane content[10, 11].
However, because the rigid triazine and oxazolidinone structures and
also the rigid imide contained in the cured matrix, these samples still
have high Tg’s.[12, 13, 14].
The pure epoxy has a storage modulus of 837.9 MPa. Incoporating
more BT resin into epoxy as in samples B, C, D, and E, the material have
higher values of storage moduli. The reason is, of course, because
these samples contain rigid structures such as imide, triazine and
oxazolidinone[15, 16]. Thus sample E shows a storage modules as high as
1129.3MPa. In general, material with high crosslinking density would
be brittle. However, since the relatively rigid and hard epoxy contains
rubbery siloxane in these co-cured materials (samples B, C, D, E),

Dielectric Constant and Dissipation Factors
Dielectric constants and dissipation factorsof samples were
performed at room temperature at 1 MHz of frequency. Data are
oresented in Table 7. The pure epoxy shows a dielectric constant of
3.59 and a dissipation factor of 101.4. When BT resin incorporated into
epoxy, both the dielectric constant and dissipation factor are effectively
reduced. Similar results are reported in literature, because of the
formation of symmetric triazine structure during the curing reaction of
cyanate ester[17, 18, 19] . In this study, since the modified cyanate ester
contains hydrophobic siloxane and symmetric imide group in the main
chain, plus the symmetric triazine structure formed in the matrix,
symmetric imide group in the main chain is expected to be more
effective in improving the electric properties than the commercial
cyanate ester.
