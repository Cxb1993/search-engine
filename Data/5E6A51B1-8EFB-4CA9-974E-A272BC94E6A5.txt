industry still needs to remain economically viable. 
Therefore, to meet perceived needs for industrial 
particulate product collection, particulate 
contaminant abatement, and environmental pollution 
control, a variety of particle control technologies 
have been developed. 
Because of the low cost of manufacturing, operating, 
and maintaining costs, cyclones are widely used in a 
variety of industrial sectors, as well as in academic 
studies. In addition, due to their simple and robust 
design, cyclones have the potential to treat high 
volumes and could be employed under high temperature 
or extreme pressure conditions. Further, compared to 
other inertial separators, such as impactors, 
cyclones are less prone to particle bounce and 
overloading, while maintaining low pressure drop. 
However, cyclones are normally used to separate 
particles in the supermicron size range. To either 
improve the cyclone collection efficiency (having a 
smaller cutoff size) or lessen the energy consumption 
(reducing the pressure drop), the elctrostatic force 
was introduced as an additional mechanism for 
capturing particles in electrocyclones. Although 
electrocyclones have these advantages, the 
performance of traditional electrocyclones will be 
easily degraded due to the particle contamination on 
the corona wire. In addition, comparing to the 
extensive studies on tangential cyclones, only a few 
literatures were published on electrocyclones. The 
performance of electrocyclones have not been fully 
explored and optimized. 
In this study, a novel mixing-type electrocyclone is 
proposed and experimentally characterized. The device 
combines a cyclone with an air-jet corona ionizer to 
prevent the corona wire directly exposing to 
challenging particles. The ion flow is introduced 
from the bottom of the cyclone. The performance was 
evaluated under different operation conditions. 
Furthermore, the device also has the potential to 
serve as an aerosol charger for submicron- to naon-
sized particles. Therefore, the finding of this work 
will provide several important applications in

開發低耗能混合型靜電旋風集塵器用於去除次微米顆粒物(精簡版) 
Abstract 
Cyclones are widely used in a variety of industrial sectors, as well as in academic studies, because of the 
low cost of manufacturing, operating, and maintaining costs. In addition, due to their simple and robust design, 
cyclones have the potential to treat high volumes and could be employed under high temperature or extreme 
pressure conditions. However, cyclones are normally used to separate particles in the supermicron size range. 
To either improve the cyclone collection efficiency (having a smaller cutoff size) or lessen the energy 
consumption (reducing the pressure drop), the elctrostatic force was introduced as an additional mechanism 
for capturing particles in electrocyclones. Although electrocyclones have these advantages, the performance 
of traditional electrocyclones will be easily degraded due to the particle contamination on the corona wire. In 
addition, comparing to the extensive studies on tangential cyclones, only a few literatures were published on 
electrocyclones. The performance of electrocyclones have not been fully explored and optimized. In this study, 
a prototype mixing-type electrocyclone is proposed and the effects of cyclone geometric dimensions on 
collection efficiency were experimentally investigated.  
 
Keywords : aerosol cyclone; corona charger; particle remover 
Introduction 
Cyclones are particle collectors using the centrifugal force to capture particles of high inertia. Because of 
the low manufacturing, operating and maintaining cost as well as the reliable performance under a wide range 
of operation conditions, large-scaled cyclones are commonly used in industrial sectors for air pollution control 
or collecting particulate products. On the other hand, small-scaled cyclones are generally used to sample 
particles in ambient and working environments. Among different cyclone types, tangential flow cyclones have 
been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Several semi-empirical and empirical models 
on cyclone’s collection efficiency curve (Lieth and Litch, 1972; Dietz, 1984; Mothes and Löffler, 1988; Iozia 
and Leith, 1990; Lidén and Gudmundssen, 1997; Avci and Karagoz, 2003) and pressure drop (Shepherd and 
Lapple, 1939; Casal and Martinez, 1983; Dirgo, 1988; Coker, 1993; Chen and Shi, 2007) have been proposed. 
In recent years, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis is also sought to characterize flow field and 
particle motion in cyclones (Griffiths and Boysan, 1996; Gimbun et al., 2005; Cortés and Gil, 2007). 
However, until recently, most of cyclone designers still relied on the used cyclone geometries those may not 
have any firm theoretical or experimental base. For example, the most popular cyclone design guides is the 
one presented by Stairmand back to 1951. This is because that the performance prediction of cyclone with 
new geometry is a very challenging task. The complex 3-D vortex turbulence flows and unclear 
particle-turbulence interaction involved in cyclones are difficult to be well simulated and verified 
experimentally. In addition, although the effects of different geometric dimensions of tangential flow cyclones 
have been experimentally studied, the effects of each geometric cyclone dimension are either partially 
investigated or lacking a conclusive result. For instance, Kenny and Gussman (2000) pointed out the 
inconsistent trend of two experimental data sets by Lidén and Gudmundssen (1996, 1997) for the relation 
between the steepness of collection efficiency curve and the size of vortex finder (V.F.). Furthermore, the 
dimensions required to determine the geometric configuration of a conventional tangential flow cyclone is as 
many as eight. In other words, the cyclone designing and optimization process is a complex engineering 
problem with 8 degrees of freedom. The first purpose of the present work is to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the effects of cyclone longitudinal and radial dimensions, including cyclone body, cone 
shape, inlet aspect ratio, total area of inlet, and V.F. sizes, on cyclone pressure drop, cutoff size and steepness 
generator/corona. The design of the ion generator is similar to the one constructed by Qi, Chen and Pui in 
2007. A point-to-plate configuration is used create the corona discharge. An electrically insulated tungsten 
needle is coaxially aligned with the ionizer body and the orifice located at the bottom. With a high voltage 
applied on the tungsten needle, gas molecules surrounding the needle tip are broken down and ionized. 
Meanwhile, compressed gas is input to the ionizer to create an air jet flow through the orifice for driving ions 
to the cyclone. 
An ultrasonic aerosol generator (SonoTek Inc., Ponghkeepsie, NY, U.S.A.) was used to generate 
supermicron challenging particles for cyclone penetration tests. The solution of Potassium Sodium Tartrate 
(PST) or Potassium Chloride (KCl) was continuously delivered to the ultrasonic atomizing nozzle by a 
syringe pump. Due to ultrasonic vibrations, the solution film formed on the tip of the nozzle was broken into 
small droplets. By mixing with filtered and dried dilution air, the supermicron solid particles were then 
produced and carried to the testing chamber. In addition, an Am241 bipolar neutralizer was located at the top of 
the chamber to neutralize the electrical charges on the particles and reduce the particle electrostatic loss. For 
the particle size distributions (PSD) measurements, a TSI Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS, TSI Inc., Model 
3321) was used to sample aerosol flow upstream and downstream of the test cyclone. The APS was able to 
measure particles with aerodynamic sizes ranging from 0.6 to 20 μm. The particle penetration of the test 
cyclone was calculated as a function of particle aerodynamic size by taking ratio of downstream and upstream 
particle concentrations at the identical size bin. The diameters with 16%, 50%, and 84% particle penetration 
(d16, d50, and d84) were determined by curve fitting the experimental penetration data using the commercial 
software Tablecurve 2D (Jandel Scientific). The steepness of the penetration curves was characterized by (d16 d84⁄ )1 2⁄ , which is equivalent to the GSD of a cumulative lognormal curve. The larger the value, the less 
sharp the penetration curve, and a value of 1.0 indicates the ideal cutoff curve as a step function. Pressure 
drop is another import performance indicator of cyclone and directly related to the power consumption, i.e. 
operating cost. In this study, the pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet of test cyclone was measured 
by a Durablock Inclined-Vertical Manometer (Dwyer Inc., Model 422-10) at four different flow rates (15, 30, 
45 and 60 lpm). Similar to the penetration test, at least five replicate measurements were carried out to verify 
the experimental precision.  
 
Results and Discussion 
Characterize the cyclone performance without an electric field 
As mentioned previously, the penetration curve and the pressure drop are the two major parameters to 
evaluate a cyclone’s performance. In the following discussions, the dimensionless pressure drop (∆H) was 
used instead of the absolute pressure drop (∆P). It can be calculated as:  
 
∆H = ∆P1
2� ρgVi
2 ,        (1) 
 
where ρg is the gas density, and Vi is the average inlet gas velocity. The definition of ∆H is similar to 
Euler number (Eu), which can be interpreted as a measure of the ratio of pressure force to inertial force. On 
the other hand, ∆H can also be recognized as the friction coefficient used to describe the head loss in the pipe 
flow. Through a dimensional analysis, for instance the Buckingham Pi method, ∆H should be a function of the 
cyclone dimension ratios, Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), and relative surface roughness. 
data sets are overlapped as H/Dc excesses the critical values. The critical values for ∆H and d50�  are about 5.5 
and 9.0 respectively. Although the critical H/Dc for d50�  is different from that for ∆H, the value of d50�  did 
another sharp transition around the critical H/Dc for ∆H. The similar S-shape behavior for d50�  was also 
described by Büttner (1988). However, some previous investigations (Burkholz, 1984; Iozia and Leith, 1990; 
Lidén and Gudmundssen, 1997) reported that the height of the cyclone does not significantly influence the 
cutoff size. The inconsistent observations may be due to the narrower experimental range of H/Dc selected in 
those studies.  
Hoffmann et al. (2001) did an experimental and theoretical analysis focusing on the effect of cyclone 
length (L=2.65Dc to 6.15Dc) and reported that the overall efficiency would slightly increase with increasing 
the length up to 5.5Dc and then dramatically reduced beyond this length. The L used in Hoffmann’s work is 
the total length below V.F. (L=H-S), and it is different from H in this discussion. They further explained the 
effect of cyclone length on separation efficiency and pressure drop may be directly or indirectly related to the 
“natural vortex length” (Lv), the distance from the bottom of V.F. to the vortex turning point. A similar 
conclusion was made by Zhu and Lee (1999). They clearly stated that when the value of (H-S) is smaller than 
the Lv (calculated using Alexander’s empirical expression), the cyclone will not perform at its full separation 
potential, as the gas will be forced into the inner vortices. In another word, increasing H could increase the 
particle residence time and the collection efficiency until (H-S) is reaching Lv. On the other hand, as H 
increasing, the extended wall surface area would impose additional friction on the flow, thus the vortex 
intensity could be reduced and lessen the separation potential. This was supported by Iozia and Leith’s (1989) 
experimental observations of the maximum tangential velocity decreasing with H/Dc. Therefore, increasing H 
can result in two competing effects for d50�  when (H-S) is less than Lv. In addition, Iozia and Leith’s results 
also implied the cyclone pressure drop would decrease with increasing H/Dc.  
The steepness of cyclone penetration curve (GSD) is generally in the range from 1.2 to 1.6, and is larger 
than the GSD of an impactor penetration curve. The 
effect of H on GSD is not as clear as those on ∆H and d50� . Fig. 1c shows that the maximum GSD, reflecting 
least steep cutoff, was located around H/Dc =5.5~6.5 
for both cyclone with and without cone. However, in 
average the penetration curves of cyclone without 
cone are slightly sharper than those of cyclone with 
cone, which is also reported by Kenny and Gussman 
(2000). They suggested the sharpness of long or 
wide-coned cyclones was dominated by the cone and 
base effects and generally sharper than those of short 
or small-coned cyclones.  
 
Effect of cyclone contraction cone  
The shape of cone was determined by three parameters, the cone bottom diameter (B), the cone height 
(hc), and the cone angle (θ). To investigate the effect of cone, three experimental series were performed. Each 
experimental series changed two parameters simultaneously and fixed the third one. Fig. 2a illustrated the 
effect of changing B/Dc and θ when hc/Dc and H/ Dc were fixed at 2.4 and 4.0 respectively. It is found in 
general ∆H and GSD is decreasing while d50�  is increasing with increasing B/Dc. The observed effects of B 
on cutoff size and pressure drop in this study were in contrast to those reported by Lidén and Gudmundssen 
Fig. 1c. GSD as a function of H/Dc. 
those in Saltzman and Hochstrasser, and the flow inside cyclone would persist in turbulent without transition. 
The reduction of ∆H with increasing hc/Dc is simply due to the dominant effect of elongated H described 
previously.  
 
Effect of vortex finder 
For the effect of V.F., two dimensions, the diameter (De) and the insertion length (S), were investigated. 
As seen in Fig. 3a, a decrease of De/Dc from 0.71 to 0.28 can enhance the collection efficiency and reduce d50�  by a factor of 2. The importance of De/Dc on cyclone performance has been illustrated by many other 
researchers (Saltzman and Hochstrasser, 1983; Dirgo and Leith, 1985; Iozia and Leith, 1990; Kim and Lee, 
1990; Moore and McFarland, 1993; Lidén and Gudmundssen, 1997; Lim, Kim and Lee, 2004). Kim and Lee 
(1990) explained that the De plays an important role in controlling both the outer and inner spiral flow 
patterns. In addition, the De has been identified as a definite influence on Lv, which also can be shown by 
examining the empirical Lv expressions. However, there were contradictory results reported for the effect of 
De/Dc on Lv (Hoffmann et al., 1995; Patterson and Munz, 1996; Bryant et al., 1983; Ji et al., 1991). In general, 
for a cyclone with small De/Dc a small and long inner spiral flow were expected to form and forcing particles 
to travel to the lower part of the cyclone. Kim and Lee (1990) further reported that the steepness was not 
affected by De/Dc, which was different from Lidén and Gudmundssen’s (1997) experimental observations and 
the trend shown in Fig. 3a. The GSD can be dramatically decreased by reducing De/Dc. It should be noted that 
reducing De/Dc would also increase the annular flow Reynolds number (Reann, the Reynolds number using the 
value of (Dc-De)/2 as the 
characteristic length), which has 
been demonstrated to better 
correlate with dimensionless cutoff 
sizes by Moore and McFarland 
(1993), Liden and Gudmundsson 
(1997), Zhu and Lee (1999) and 
Hsiao et al. (2010). In general the 
dimensionless cutoff size is 
decreasing with increasing Reann 
and approaching a constant for very 
large Reann. Therefore, these results 
indirectly evidenced the 
significance and the effect of De/Dc 
on the cutoff size. 
In addition to collection efficiency, Kim and Lee (1990) also explored the effect of De/Dc on the cyclone 
pressure drop, and observed a minimum value occurred at De/Dc of about 0.5-0.6. However, there was no 
saddle point existed for ΔH in Fig. 3a. Theoretically, ΔH can be divided into four components contributed by 
different flow regions: (1) the flow expansion at the cyclone inlet (ΔH1); (2) the flow contraction at the 
entrance of the cyclone outlet (ΔH2); (3) the frictional loss, including the swirling loss due to the friction 
between the gas flow and the cyclone wall (ΔH3); (4) the viscous dissipation loss of the gas dynamic energy in 
the V.F. (ΔH4) (Chen and Shi, 2007). Cortés and Gil, (2007) claimed ΔH4 generally dominated over the other 
three components in cyclones, and such energy dissipation was roughly proportional to the absolute 
magnitude of vt2. Hence, any influence that tends to increase the strength of the vortex could increase the 
Fig. 3a. Effect of De/Dc on ∆H, d50� , and GSD. 
operation flow rate remained unchanged. Therefore, the strong proportional fashion between  d50�  and the 
inlet area shown in Fig. 4a was expected. However, surprisingly, decreased inlet velocity by increasing inlet 
area raises ΔH, although the absolute pressure drop of cyclone was decreasing with increasing inlet area. This 
actually has been documented in many studies. Fig 4a also showed a similar linear correlation between GSD 
and (a×b)/Dc2, and the optimum sharpness at inlet area equal to outlet area (Ai/Ae~1.0) suggested by Lidén and 
Gudmundssen (1997) was not found here. 
For the effect of inlet aspect 
ratio (a/b), no clear trend was found 
for ΔH and GSD, but d50�  was 
decreasing with increasing a/b (Fig. 
4b). This is somewhat contradictory 
to the results published by Iozia and 
Leith (1990). They found that the 
cyclone efficiency was independent 
of a/b for two different inlet areas 
and pressure drop for the cyclone 
with shorter inlet height was lower 
than that with narrower inlet width. 
Lidén and Gudmundssen (1997) 
also argued the cutoff size ought to 
be independent of the inlet geometry mainly based on the experimental findings of Ji et al. (1991): the 
tangential velocity close to the cyclone wall (vθ,w, which was believed to be a determinative factor for particle 
collection) was only marginally influenced by changing the inlet geometry. However, most of the theoretical 
works (Ranft, 1954; Meissner, 1977; and Mothes and Löffler, 1984) indicated the vθ,w was depending on the 
inlet geometry. In addition, reducing b could force the particles close to the cyclone wall and develop the 
possibility for particle deposition on the wall. Gimbun et al. (2004) also argued the large b could cause the 
contraction of the vortex at the cyclone inlet thus resulting in poor vortex formation and reduce collection 
efficiency. Although a distinct correlation between a/b and d50�  was observed in this study, the effect is 
relatively minor. Coker (1993) recommended the b should be smaller than (Dc-De)/2. 
 
The cyclone performance with an electric field 
The prototype of the Mixing-type Electrocyclone consists of two components, an ion generator/corona 
ionizer and a cyclone (Fig. 5). The ion generator is similar to the one constructed by Qi, Chen and Pui (2007). 
The cyclone configuration is based on the optimal modular cyclone. The optimization process of the modular 
cyclone is operated under 30 lpm. However, the preliminary experimental results show that the electrocyclone 
does not take any advantage of the electrostatic collection when it operated under this flow rate. It is mainly 
because the short aerosol residence time in the electrostatic precipitation zone. Therefore, the operational flow 
rate was reduced to 5 lpm for the following tests. The cutoff size of the tangential-flow cyclone was then 
increased from 2.3μm to 12.0 μm for the case without introducing any ion flow.

charges and can be collected when passing through electrostatic precipitation zone. At last, when both the 
corona charger and the collecting voltage were set on, the Case D’s penetration curve has the lowest 
penetration fraction and smallest cutoff size. Comparing to the 12.0 μm for the case without introducing any 
ion flow, the cutoff size of the Case D decreases to about 10.0 μm.

受到此一趨勢與企圖，尤其中國大陸與韓國更是明顯。參展儀器大多由歐美國家研究成果技轉而成，
日韓中亦積極加入研究技轉的趨勢與行列，但台灣卻盡是代理商。或許台灣的研究仍是過度傾向於應
