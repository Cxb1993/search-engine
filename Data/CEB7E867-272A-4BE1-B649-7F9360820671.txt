Abstract— PLS algorithm has been proved successfully in block motion estimation on media processors due 
to low control overhead and high data reusability. These characteristics causes PLS also suitable for hardware 
VLSI implementation. However, the line search pattern of PLS results in high computational complexity since 
it searches all points in a horizontal line of the predefined search range. To improve this issue, a refined 
adaptive search range (RASR) technique based on the motion activities is proposed to define the horizontal 
and vertical search ranges separately, which can effectively reduces redundant search points in the line search 
pattern of PLS. Experimental results show that RASR significantly improves 63% computational speed 
averagely over the original PLS for block motion estimation.

Furthermore, the Motion Adaptive Search (MAS) [17] uses the global motion activity (GMA) to represent 
the analysis of the rough motion activity over the entire video frame, and the local motion activity (LMA) 
characterizes the motion activity within the small region (macroblock basis). These two motion activity 
information available in the motion vector field adapt the search range to reduce the search points. 
Nevertheless, like other block matching algorithms, adaptive search range (ASR) of MAS takes the maximum 
search range of horizontal and vertical directions. This is inefficient for those horizontal- or vertical-biased 
motion sequences. Take the 50th frame in Figure 1 (a) and the 60th frame in Figure 1 (b) from coastguard 
sequence as an example, the only difference between these two frames is the yacht moves from left to the 
right and the other objects almost keep stationary. In other words, the scene has a property of horizontal 
movement, but vertical movement is almost stationary. By applying ASR for such horizontal-biased motion 
sequence, the vertical search range will be set the same as the horizontal search range since the search window 
is fixed in a square shape. Consequently, this incurs unnecessary search points in vertical search range. On the 
other hand, only if the search doesn’t early stop before reaching the horizontal search boundary, will the 
aforementioned fast algorithms [3]-[9] benefit from ASR technique. However, brutal search based algorithms 
such as FS and PLS can always benefit much from ASR technique.

In this paper, in order to alleviate the computation of the line search pattern of PLS, a refined adaptive 
search range (RASR) technique has been proposed which is based on the motion activity from horizontal and 
vertical directions separately. That is, the horizontal and vertical search ranges are estimated respectively. 
Take a vertical-biased motion sequence as an example, a rectangular search window with the width smaller 
than the height can be estimated, instead of a square one, for shrinking the length of the PLS line search 
pattern which is subject to the horizontal search range. Hence, we calculate both the grades of GMA and LMA 
by breaking up the horizontal and vertical components of the motion vectors. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, revised global motion activity and local 
motion activity are proposed. Section 3 describes the proposed RASR for PLS. The experimental results are 
presented in Section 4 and conclusions are given in Section 5.

Notably, the RASR automatically adapts the horizontal and vertical search ranges based on motion activity 
separately. Fig. 3 depicts the adaptation of

 by the RASR during the encoding of the

independent to each other based on their respective variation of global motion activity at any given time 
instance. The thresholds Th1 and Th2 can be taken as the moderator of the horizontal and vertical search 
ranges for avoiding too small to get minimum matching error for real-world sequence with wide variety of 
motion.

from horizontal and vertical global and local motion activities, respectively. By eliminating a great deal of the 
unnecessary search points, about 63% computation is saved with only about 0.13dB PSNR drop compared 
with PLS. Compared with ASR_PLS, RASR_PLS can save around 5% search points in average while 
preserving the almost the same PSNR in average.
