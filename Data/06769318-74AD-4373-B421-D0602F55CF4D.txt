Estimating and Forecasting the Strength of Heat Source about
Non-Fourier Heat Conduction Problem by the Inverse Method
and Grey–Markov Chains Model
.
Abstract
This study is intended to provide an inverse method combined with
Grey –Markov Chains Model for estimating and forecasting the strength of
heat source about Non-Fourier heat conduction problem. At the beginning of
this study, finite-difference method is employed to discrete the problem
domain and then a linear inverse model is constructed to identify the strength
of heat source. The present approach is to rearrange the matrix forms of
differential governing equation and estimated coefficients of unknown
condition. Then, the linear least-squares method is adopted to find the solution.
Using the estimating value forecasted the further data of heat source by Grey–
Markov Chains Model.
The advantage of applying this method in inverse analysis is that no prior
information is needed on the functional form of the unknown quantities, no
initial guess is required and the iterations of calculation process can be done
only once. The Markov Chains-Grey model uses the operations of accumulated
generation to build differential equations. The Markov Chains-Grey modeling
emphasis just needs using very little history data (about 4 sample data) to build
the grey prediction model, and then we can use this model to forecast the other
further unknown output data, then to predict or to control generating equipment
reliability, the device failure occurs can be avoid.

5Introduction
The inverse source problem is the determination of the strength of the
heat source from the temperature measured at a different point other than the
source locations. It is practical in much design and manufacturing areas in
which the strength of the heat source is undetermined. Common problems
include the detection of the quantity of the energy generation in a computer
chip, or in a microwave heating process, or in a chemical reaction process. The
situations involving very low temperatures near absolute zero, very high
temperature gradients, or extremely short times, heat is found to propagate at a
finite speed. For these situations, the hyperbolic heat conduction (HHC) model
is employed to account for the phenomena of finite heat propagation speed.
Such non-Fourier conduction equations have been used successfully to examine
rapid transient conduction processes in chemical process engineering [2], laser
pulse heating [3], and laser annealing [4]. Guo and Xu [5] addressed the non-
Fourier conduction in an IC chip with emphasis on the discrepancy from the
Fourier conduction and its influence on thermal reliability. Many researchers
have explored the HHC problem of electronic component cooling in the form
of a ‘direct problem’. However, when the heat flux or temperature at electronic
components is very high or other special situations are concerned, direct
measurement of surface conditions is impossible. Practicaly, ‘inverse 
problems’ are applied in these cases. Measurements of temperature are often
made at one or more interior locations of the substrate. Then these
measurements are curve-fitted to estimate physical quantities and surface
conditions.
The grey system theory was first proposed by Deng [6] in 1982 to study
the uncertainty of a system. In the grey system theory (Nagai and Yamaguchi
[7]; Lui and Lin [8]), according to the degree of information, if the system
information is fully known, the system is called a white system, while if the
7condition. Then, the linear least-squares method is adopted to find the solution.
Using the estimating value forecasted the further data of heat source by Markov
chain-Grey MCGM (1,1) model, and we can use this model to forecast the
other further unknown output data, then to predict or to control generating
equipment reliability, the device failure occurs can be avoid.

Equation (9) is assumed to represent the measurements of all discretized
points in the problem. In most cases, not all of the points are needed to be
measured. Therefore, only part of matrix R and T, and part of vector  that
correspond to the measuring positions need to be constructed. In general, when
a large portion of the matrices and vector is selected, the number of
transducers or measuring points is large. Therefore, the cost of computation
and experiment increases. However, a larger number of measuring points yield
more accurate estimated results.
In equation (9), the inverse problem is solved by using the linear least-
squares error method so that the problem is solved in a linear domain to avoid

Results and Discussion

In the simulation problem, the accuracy of the estimation of unknowns
from the knowledge of the temperature at measurement points depends
strongly on the accuracy of the measurements. As will be seen in the examples,
the estimated solutions without measurement error ( = 0) converge to the
solutions solved by the finite-difference method for all examples. Furthermore,
the solutions are unique through the proposed verifying method. Using the
above inverse method to have the estimating value, taking this value to
constructed GM(1,1), DGM(1,1) and MCGM(1,1) model, then to forecast the
further date about the strength of the heat source. Detailed descriptions for the
problem are presented as follows.
Example 1:
The unknown heat sorce (x,y,t) are expressed as:
(x,y,t)= t 0.0t1.0, x=0. 5, y=0. 5
(x,y,t)= 2.0- t 1.0t2.0, x=0. 5, y=0. 5
Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the estimated quality of (x,y,t) for three
cases of measurement errors, i.e. = 0.1%, 1.0% and 5.0% with one
measurement point ((x,y) = (0.375, 0.375)) and dimensionless time interval of
t =0.01~2.0 in this example. It was found that the oscillation for heat sorce
(x,y,t) response became more severe as the measurement error increases.
The average discrepancies between the estimated quality of (x,y,t) and the
exact value are 0.011%, 9.56% and 32.76% for the cases of = 0.1%, 1.0%
and 5.0%, respectively.
Table 1 and Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the estimated and forecasted
heat sorce (x,y,t) for measurement errors of =10.0% with N = 3; the
measurement points are located at ( x, y) = (0.375, 0.375), (0.75, 0.25) and
(0.25, 0.75). In Table 1, the DGM (1,1) forecasting values which mainly uses
four estimated data (0.165, 0.314, 0.175, and 0.472) entries in the same series
(usually 4 points) to construct a GM (1,1) model, and then predict the
19
(x,y,t)=0.5+0.5sin(
4
t5
) 0.0t2.0, x=0.5,y=0. 5
Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the estimated quality of (x,y,t) for three
cases of measurement errors, i.e. = 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.0% with one
measurement point ((x,y) = (0.375, 0.375)) and dimensionless time interval of
t =0.01~2.0 in this example. It was found that the oscillation for heat sorce
(x,y,t) response became more severe as the measurement error increases.
The average discrepancies between the estimated quality of (x,y,t) and the
exact value are 2.13%, 11.43% and 19.76% for the cases of = 0.1%, 0.5%
and 1.0%, respectively.
Table 2 and Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the estimated and forecasted heat
sorce  (x,y,t) for measurement errors of 0.5% with N = 3; the
measurement points are located at ( x, y) = (0.375, 0.375), (0.75, 0.25) and
(0.25, 0.75). In Table 2, the DGM (1,1) forecasting values which mainly uses
four estimated data (0.5, 0.695, 0.729, and 0.946) entries in the same series
(usually 4 points) to construct a GM (1,1) model, and then predict the
forecasting value of the next data (1.09) entry, then abandon the first data ( 0.5)
entry from the original series, add a fifth data (0.967) entry to construct a
second series, forecast the value of the sixth data (1.13) entry, etc., until the
last data entry in the original data. The result shows that the forecasting value
(1.12) of the future time ( t = 2.1) can obtained. The average discrepancies
between the estimated quality, forecasted strength of (x,y,t) and the exact
value are 5.59%, and 17.46% for the error = 0.5%, respectively.
Using Grey-Markov mode, according to the predicted data series {xˆ 
(0)(k), k=1, 2, …, n} by DGM(1,1), the corresponding intervals are divided
into four states for this study. The four states are 1 = S1 = [ Qexact()-0.15,
Qexact()-0.07], 2 = S2= [ Qexact()-0.07, Qexact()], 3 = S3 = [Qexact(),
Qexact()+0.07] and 4 = S4 = [ Qexact()+0. 07, Qexact ()+0.17]. The four
states are plotted in Fig. 6. The transition probability matrices of state P(m),

data. In the first example, due to the complicated reflection and interaction of
thermal waves, the numerical solutions exhibit severe oscillations in the
vicinity of the jump discontinuity. This phenomenon is known as the Gibbs
phenomenon, which is of practical importance since it causes difficulty to
obtain a convergent solution in the neighborhood of the jump discontinuity [7].
The phenomenon reflects the fact that the inverse non-Fourier heat conduction
problem is different from the inverse Fourier heat conduction problem.
One shortcoming of this method is needed to solve a system of
simultaneous equations. Also, the inverse matrix R [Eq. (9)] may become ill
conditioned for temperature responses larger measurement error. The
estimated value is very sensitive to any error in the temperature measurement
and may even become unstable. The sensitivity depends on the type of
problem being solved (i.e., the governing equation and its boundary
conditions), the position where the temperature is measured, the measurement
error and the number of sensors. The present results confirm that the inverse
values are extremely sensitive to measurement error, sensor location and
number of sensors, as mentioned by Beck et al. (1985) and Hensel (1991).
Conclusion
A successful inverse solution for estimating the heat generation rate in
non-Fourier heat conduction problem. A direct inverse formulation is
constructed using the reverse matrix, which is derived from the governing
equations as well as initial and boundary conditions. Two examples have been
examined to show the robustness of the proposed method. From the results, it
appears that by using the proposed method without measurement error, the
exact solution can be found even when measurement is made at only one point.
When the measurement errors are included, it is suggested that more
measurement points (two or three) to be adopted for a better result in the
