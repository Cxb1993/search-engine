I. Introduction 
The solutions of the axisymmetric circular cylinder quantum nano jet can be governed by the time-dependent 
linear Schrödinger equation that is solved by two approaches. One is a partial analytic method based on the Fourier-
Bessel transform and the other is numerical method based on finite difference methods. Appropriate boundary 
conditions for the solutions of the circular cylinder quantum nano jet are derived. By the Fourier-Bessel transform 
method, several integral formulas for the solutions of the jet are obtained. The Gaussian quadrature numerical 
integration is then applied to evaluate the integrals. The fourth-order central and compact difference methods are 
used for the numerical approach. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta time integration is applied for the time marching. 
Detailed comparisons between the partial analytic and numerical methods are performed. The results indicate that 
the partial analytic method can obtain right solutions and the proposed numerical method can capture the dispersion 
wave very well.

Which means that the probability density equals 2 and the velocity equals 2 at the inlet of quantum nano jet. N  is 
the quantum Reynolds number defined as the ratio of the inertia force to quantum force, N = mUb/h, where m is the 
mass of particle, U is the inlet velocity, b is the jet diameter, and h is the Planck constant. [8] 
 
In this paper, two approaches, partial analytic and numerical methods, are used to solve the solutions of EQ. (1). 
First, the mathematical formulation is derived for the partial analytic approach. It is assumed that

Note that there has a part xNkeb

infinity. This will reduce the accuracy of this approach. However those high frequent waves will be damped to zero 
very quickly as N is large. This approach is good enough for a suitable large x. This is why we call this approach is a 
partial analytic method.

IV. Finite Difference Methods 
In this section, numerical methods to solve EQ. (1) are introduced. The fourth-order central and compact difference 
methods are proposed.  The EQ. (1) is solved in a rectangle domain [0, X] * [0, R]. This domain is partitioned into 
uniform mesh sizes in both dimensions, yielding grid points

Where

  The second derivative, xxf  and yf , can be approximated by the following two methods:

increasing the Reynolds number above 100 to 1000, a single jet structure is clearer. Figures 2-4 show the structures 
of probability density N = 100, 500, and 900, respectively. Note that the transition Reynolds number is 
approximately 100.  
Now, the computational results obtained the proposed numerical methods are presented. From the above discussions, 
the results for N = 10 are presented here to show the accuracy of the schemes. The computational domain is chosen 
as [0, 12]*[0, 6]. Fig. 5 shows the contours of the probability densities for N = 10 obtained by the FD4 and CP4 
methods. The contours are very close to the results obtained by the partial analytic method. To further compare the 
results obtained by the partial analytic and numerical method, Fig. 6 and 7 show the density distribution and 
complex-valued wave functions at the center line obtained by  FD4 and CP4, respectively, as Mx are chosen to be 
400, 600, 800, and Mr = 0.5*Mx. One can see the convergence of these two numerical methods. The complex-
valued wave functions obtained by both methods are very close to the data obtained by the partial analytic method. 
This indicates the consistency between these two approaches. Only smaller difference occurs on the phase and this 
produce larger difference on the density distributions between two approaches. We expect that the results obtained 
by the numerical methods are more accurate and the phase difference dues to the neglect of the part

VI. Conclusion 
      A mathematical model and related boundary conditions are established to describe the solutions of axisymmetric 
circular cylinder quantum nano jets. Two approaches, partial analytic and numerical methods, are proposed to solve 
its solutions. For the partial analytic method, the Fourier-Bessel transform is used. Several integrals are obtained and 
the Gaussian numerical integration is used to integrate the integrals. Since the part xNkeb
22
2
−  is neglected in 
this method, small phase errors are produced in the complex-valued complex function. This will produce larger 
errors on the probability density.  For the numerical method, the fourth-order central and compact difference 
methods are used for the spatial derivatives. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta time integration method is applied for the 
time marching. The computational results show the convergence of the proposed numerical methods and they can 
capture the dispersion wave very well. The comparisons between the partial analytic and numerical methods are 
good.
