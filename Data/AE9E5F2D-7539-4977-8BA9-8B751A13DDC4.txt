21 GHz in an LG=1.1μm IIIVOI FET. This 
compares well with 0.35μm SiO2/Si MOSFETs.  
The issue of interface quality was overcome 
by in-situ deposited Al atomic layers, which 
were subsequently converted to Al2O3. The 
self-aligned Schottky source-drain (SSD) [5]-[6] 
contacts avoided the difficult dopant activation 
issue after ion-implantation, by taking advantage 
of the small barrier height (φB~0.2eV) on the 
contact of InGaAs. 
二、實驗步驟 
For the IIIVOI devices, we used an inverted 
HEMT structure, grown on InP. Such inverted 
device structure is used because of the following 
wafer bonding for IIIVOI and thinning down InP 
substrate. The IIIVOI/Si process was similar to 
the GOI [1]-[3] approach: after depositing SiO2 
on Si and InAlAs, an O2+ plasma was applied to 
enhance the wafer bonding that was done at 
400oC. Such O2+ plasma enhanced wafer 
bonding is the key issue to successfully bond the 
two SiO2 covered wafers at a low temperature of 
only 400oC. Then the InP substrate was thinned 
down by chemical-mechanical polishing, and 
selective etching of InP and InAlAs was 
performed. The above process steps formed the 
IIIVOI device structure. To fabricate the HEMT 
on-insulator, a recess etching the n+ InGaAs over 
the gate was performed. Then the III-V FET was 
formed by Ti/Au Schottky gate deposition and 
patterning, followed by NiGeAu source-drain 
contact metal deposition and sintering [4].  
For III-V MOSFET, the device structure was 
created by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) 
growth of 20nm-InGaAs/300nm-InAlAs on InP, 
with a few atomic Al layers covering the InGaAs 
surface on top without breaking the vacuum. 
Then the wafer was removed from vacuum and 
exposed to air ambient, and Al2O3 gate dielectric 
was deposited by sputtering in the presence of 
O2+. The Al-gate/Al2O3/InGaAs MOSFET was 
fabricated using a process similar to that for 
metal/high-κ/Si MOSFETs [1]-[3], but using 
Al/Yb SSD [5]-[6] rather than n+ ion 
implantation. Such SSD contact prevents the 
troublesome ion-implanted dopant activation in 
source-drain junctions, which is a difficult task 
in III-V FETs. 
三、結果與討論 
A. Defect-free InAlAs/InGaAs/InAlAs IIIVOI 
FET: 
Fig. 1 shows a TEM image of the 
InAlAs/InGaAs/InAlAs/SiO2/Si device structure, 
and the absence of dislocations are clearly 
observed, along with a schematic of the band 
structure. From our previous GOI works, the 
white line in SiO2 is due to the O2 plasma 
treatment, which is quite effective to enhance the 
bonding at low temperature. Such dislocation 
free IIIVOI is required for VLSI circuit 
manufacture with good yield, which is in sharp 
contrast to the >106 dislocations/cm2 in direct 
growth of III-V materials on Si using any 
existing technology such as graded super-lattice, 
staircase super-lattice or relaxed buffers etc. 
Besides, good bonding interface was found and 
sharp quantum well was still preserved.  This is 
due to the low bonding temperature to cause less 
inter-diffusion in quantum well/barrier. The 
sharp quantum well is further evident from the 
good electrical characteristics: a large channel 
carrier density was 2.2×1012 cm-2 with a high 
Hall mobility of 8,100 cm2/Vs.

than the SiO2/Si MOSFET at the same EOT due

四、結論 
We have demonstrated a defect-free IIIVOI 
FET and high mobility in an 
Al2O3/InAlAs/InGaAs MOSFET. The good 
quality of IIIVOI HEMT is shown from the high 
mobility of 8,100cm2/Vs. The electron mobility 
of Al2O3/InAlAs/InGaAs MOSFET shows 2.5X 
higher than that for the Al2O3/Si MOSFET. 
These are the two key factors to realize high 
performance III-V material n-MOSFET on Si. 
 
國際電子元件論文會議 
(International Electron Device Meeting,IEDM of IEEE)  
December 11-13, 2006 
Hilton San Francisco and Towers 
San Francisco, CA 
Over the last 51 years, the IEEE/IEDM has been the world's main forum for 
reporting breakthroughs in technology, design, manufacturing, physics and the 
modeling of semiconductors and other electronic devices. Topics range from deep 
submicron CMOS transistors and memories to novel displays and imagers, from 
compound semiconductor materials to nanotechnology devices and architectures, 
from micromachined devices to smart-power technologies, etc. 
This is especially important given that as technology advances, the sophistication in 
the integration of different modules grows and a cross-disciplinary approach 
becomes even more necessary to continue to expand the critical value technology 
has provided to our global societies. 
The strong international nature of our industry and the broad range of topics are 
evident by range of contributed papers and invited speakers from around the world. 
TWO SHORT COURSES HELD ON SUNDAY, DECEMBER 10  
• "32nm CMOS Technology"  
• "Memory Technologies for 45nm and Beyond"

We report novel 1000°C-stable [Ir3Si-TaN]/HfLaON for the first time with full 
process compatibility to current VLSI. Good WF of 5.08 and 4.32 eV, low Vt of -0.10 
and 0.18 V, high mobility of 84 and 217 cm2/Vs (1.7 nm EOT), and small 85°C BTI 
<20 mV are measured for CMOSFETs.  
「目的」 
 夲次至美國舊金山參加國際電子元件（International Electron Device Meeting，
IEDM of IEEE）論文研討會。 
「會議」 
 本次國際電子元件論文共有近 700 篇論文參加競爭。本次會議參加其評量委
員們包含 Intel、IBM、AMD、Freescale（美國部份）、CEA-LETI、IMEC、
ST-Microelectron、Infineon（歐洲）、Toshiba、Fujitsu、TSMC 及交通大學（亞洲）。
由此可知 IEDM 之論文審查委員，乃由美、歐、亞之精英專家們共同主持。由此
可知這個會議之重要性，由於過去 IEDM 論文之接受率只有接近 30％，因此學校
教授不但要有足夠的創新及國際競爭力，方有機會和國際跨國公司平起平坐，擠
近前 1/3 將論文接受。而且本校電子 系也將此研討會訂為最重要的重點會議亦
可知道其有多重要。由於本次學術界最多論文之學校，乃由新加坡大學獲得，此
外，Stanford 等國際知名大學亦在台灣各個大學之前，國內學術界如要進入前幾
強，必須要和國外大學般的強調合作的重要，而且工業界亦要幫助學術界之部份
資源提供，以達到台灣各個大學進入國際前茅之目標。此外，跨國實質上的合作
亦是成功的要件。 
 
eV are obtained. The Ir/HfLaON failed after 1000oC RTA; in 
contrast, the Ir3Si/HfLaON can meet the 1000oC stability 
although trading off the slightly lower φm-eff. Here the Ir 
composition in IrxSi is x=3 from XRD measurement (Fig. 
12). The dual metal-gates on HfLaON are further analyzed 
by AES and SIMS. As shown in Figs. 13-14, such good 
device characteristics are due to the nitridation on thick 
high-κ that prevents TaN or Ir3Si metal diffusion through 
HfLaON. The high φm-eff is due to the Ir3Si accumulated 
toward HfLaON interface to un-pin the Fermi-level [5]. Fig. 
15 shows the J-EOT plot, where much improved leakage 
current than SiO2 is obtained at 1.6 nm EOT. In addition, 
high κ of 20 is still preserved even after 1000oC RTA and 
much better than HfO2 (Fig. 16).   
(C). [Ir3Si-TaN]/HfLaON CMOSFETs: 
The Id-Vd and Id-Vg of Ir3Si/HfLaON and TaN/HfLaON 
CMOSFETs are shown in Figs. 17-18. In addition to the 
good transistor characteristics, proper Vt of 0.18 and -0.10 V 
are measured for n- and p-MOSFETs. The electron and hole 
mobility are shown in Fig. 19, where high mobility of 217 
and 84 cm2/Vs are obtained. The gate reliability is shown in 
Figs. 20-21. A large 2.6 V operation voltage for 10-years is 
obtained from the tBD plot. Further reliability study is from 
the BTI shown in Fig. 22, where <20 mV shift are measured 
for CMOS at 10 MV/cm stress and 85oC for 1 hr. Table 1 
summarizes the comparison among various metal-gate/ 
high-κ CMOS. The merits of [Ir3Si-TaN]/HfLaON CMOS 
are proper φm-eff of 5.08 and 4.24 eV, low Vt of -0.10 and 0.18 
V, high mobility of 84 and 217 cm2/Vs, and small BTI <20 
mV (85oC, 10 MV/cm & 1 hr). These results are comparable 
with or better than the best reported data for metal-gate/ 
high-κ CMOS, with additional advantage of full process 
compatibility with current poly-Si/SiON CMOS line. 
Conclusions 
Proper 5.08-4.24 eV φm,eff, good 1000oC stability and low 
leakage are obtained in Ir3Si-TaN gated HfLaON CMOS.
