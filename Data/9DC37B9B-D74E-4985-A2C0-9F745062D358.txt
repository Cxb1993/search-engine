was solved by implementing one dimensional ghost cell approach 
and the stretching grid technique near the fluid-structure boundaries 
were used to catch the detailed evolution of local flow field.  
 
The developed numerical scheme was verified by rigorous 
benchmark tests. Not only the reported analytical, numerical and 
experimental studies were compared with the present numerical 
results, and all the benchmark tests of this study showed excellent 
accuracy of the developed numerical scheme.  
 
The study related to tuned liquid damper (TLD) in 2D tanks was 
considered in this study. A comprehensive investigation for a 2D 
tank with vertically tank bottom-mounted baffles (baffled tank) are 
demonstrated and discussed with respect to the influence of baffle 
height on the natural mode of the tank, the evolution of vortices and 
vortex shedding phenomenon. The baffle height shows a significant 
influence on the shift of the first natural frequency of the baffled 
tank and the liquid depth also plays an important part in determining 
this influence. The proposed numerical scheme can be extended to 
simulate the sloshing liquid in a 3D tank with internal structures 
under six degrees of freedom.

desirable. Because this is a similar procedure used for antirolling tanks onboard ships, 
it is of interest to report on TLD studies.  Warnitchai and Pinkeaw (1998) studied the 
mathematical model compared with experimental investigations for a rectangular tank 
with flow-damping devices. The vertical flat plate and wire mesh screen can cause 
significant damping effects on sloshing waves. Isaacson and Premasiri (2001) 
developed the mathematic solutions and experiment investigations to describe the 
hydrodynamic damping due to baffles in a fluid-filled rectangular tank undergoing 
horizontal motions. The average rate of energy dissipation due to flow separation 
around baffles and the total energy of sloshing waves are used to estimate the 
hydrodynamic damping.  
 
For numerical studies associated with TLD, the finite element method is a popular 
numerical method in solving the baffled tank. Biswal et al. (2006) applied FEM on 
computing the non-linear sloshing response of liquid in a two-dimensional rectangular 
tank and circular cylindrical container with rigid baffles. The effect of baffle 
parameters including length, numbers and position on sloshing response were 
discussed. A 3D BEM model for liquid sloshing in baffled tank was adopted by 
Firouz-Abadi et al. (2008). The determinations of the natural frequencies and mode 
shapes of liquid sloshing in 3D baffled tanks with arbitrary geometries were 
investigated. However, the potential flow assumption used in FEM cannot predict the 
effect of energy dissipation due to viscous sloshing and flow separation. Kim (2001) 
and Kim et al. (2004) employed the SLOA scheme to study the 3D liquid sloshing 
with baffles and compared the impact pressure with that in unbaffled tank. Liu and 
Lin (2008) used NEWTANK to investigate liquid sloshing in 3D baffled tank with 
LES (Large-eddy-simulation). In their study, the vertical baffle is a more effective 
tool in reducing the sloshing amplitude. Panigrahy et al. (2009) did a series of 
experiment in a developed liquid sloshing with and without different types of baffles 
under various fill depth. The pressure developed on the tank walls and the free surface 
displacement of water from the mean static level were measured and analyzed. They 
concluded that the introduction of baffles in the tank decreases effectively the 
sloshing displacement because the sharp-edged baffles could dissipate the kinetic 
energy by generating turbulence in the flow and the type of ring baffles are the most 
effective device to reduce sloshing energy.

2.1 Governing equations in a moving coordinate system 
 
In this work, the sloshing phenomenon in a rigid tank with partially filled liquid is 
analyzed by a time-independent finite difference method (Chen and Nokes, 2005). As 
illustrated in Figure 2.1, the breadth of the tank is L, d0 and db are the still water depth 
and the baffle length, respectively. The Navier-Stokes equations are written in moving 
coordinate system and can be expressed as

  with respect to x and others have the same meanings. In the present study, Eq. (2-5) 
is used to determine the hydrodynamic pressure at the free surface, while Eq (2-6) is 
used to calculate velocity u at the free surface. 
 
The no-slip condition is applied at the boundary between fluid and solid, that is u = 0 , 
v=0 and w = 0 at the tank walls. Consider a contact line being constrained to move 
across the solid surface with a speed, say U. It is known that the contact angle 
increases or decreases as the magnitude of U increases according to whether the liquid 
is advancing or receding (Dussan, 1979 ). Cox (1986) described the manner in which 
the contact angle varies with the contact line velocity U. This angle is evaluated by 
calculating the liquid interface shape near the contact line due to the action of the 
stresses in the liquid produced by the motion. It is also well known that for all contact 
angles other than 180o, there is a non-integrable singularity in the stress at the contact 
line that will result in a divergent integral for the drag force on the solid boundary. 
 
In order to avoid this problem, slip between the liquid and solid surface has been 
postulated (see Dussan, 1976 and Hocking, 1978) and this assumption removes the 
non-integrable stress singularity. The treatment of the contact line by Tang et al. 
(1990), which has been successfully applied by both Chen (1999) and Huang et al. 
(1998), is adopted here. Tang’s assumption states that the no-slip boundary condition 
is relaxed in the region of the first two nodes on the tank wall beneath the free surface. 
Since the mesh size near the free surface is stretched, the slip condition is only applied 
in a very small region, less than 1% of the fluid depth. The results are compared with 
those based on the assumption invoked by Billinghen (2002) in order to verify the size 
of the stretched region.

Chapter 4   Results and Discussion 
 
A Tuned Liquid Damper (TLD) is one possible damping device of tall buildings 
under wind and earthquake excitations. The ship motions excite sloshing, which in 
return affects the ship motions. Ships equipped with anti-rolling tanks utilize this 
effect that the sloshing-induced roll moment on the vessel will cause roll damping if 
the highest natural sloshing period is tuned to be close to the roll natural period .The 
principle of a TLD to provide damping is similar to anti-rolling tanks that damp roll 
motions. It is the first natural period that is of concern for wind and earthquake 
excited oscillations. The first step of designing a TLD is to select the natural sloshing 
period equal to the natural period of the oscillation mode that should be dampened. 
The length of the TLD perpendicular to the flow direction determines the magnitude 
of the oscillation damping caused by the TLD. Damping devices are introduced in a 
TLD in order to broaden the period range with satisfactory oscillation damping. 
Moreover, screens perpendicular to the flow directions can be effective used as the 
sloshing damping devices when they are properly placed in the tank (Faltinsen 
&Timokha, 2009). In this study, the benchmark tests for a vertical baffle mounted on 
the middle of tank bottom for 2D tanks are discussed as follows.

where m is the mode of natural frequency. The comparison between the present result 
and asymptotic formula and the numerical result (Boundary Element Method) 
reported by Firoua-Abadi (2008), as depicted in Figure 4.16, agree well when db/d0 
≤0.3. For larger ratio of db/d0, the asymptotic formula is inadequate to predict the 
influence of internal baffles on the natural frequency of the tank. Based on the 
assumption of potential flow, the boundary element method cannot describe the 
phenomenon of flow separation that would cause energy dissipation to affect the 
natural frequency of sloshing waves. As db/d0 is close to 1, which means the baffle is 
beneath the free surface for a small distance, the obvious influence of the baffle on the 
natural frequency of the tank is significant. The further investigation of the effect of 
the baffle height on the natural frequency of liquid sloshing will be discussed in 
chapter 8.

The viscous damping due to baffles is presented here. We will illustrate how to 
estimate the effect of baffles on sloshing damping by both the present numerical 
method and asymptotic formula (Faltinsen &Timokha, 2009). The brief description of 
asymptotic method on sloshing damping is as follows. No excitation of the tank is 
assumed and the lowest linear mode will be examined. The presence of the baffle on 
the natural mode and frequency is neglected.  We proceed as we did in the section of 
damping due to viscous flow in the boundary layers at the tank walls. The damping 
ratio x  is found from

excitation frequency of the tank. Vortex shedding phenomenon due to stronger 
vertical jets occurs when the excitation frequency is close to the first natural mode 
of the baffled tank.

baffles under six-degrees of freedom.
