Abstract 
To provide the optimal real-time releases for operators on a multi-reservoir 
system during typhoon, we propose the methodology to extract a set of optimal 
multi-reservoir operation rules for flood control. The two classification technologies, 
namely decision-tree algorithm (C5.0) and neural-based decision-tree algorithm 
(NDT) are employed in the extracting rules. The tasks involves four parts: (1) 
collection of data, (2) development of the model of optimal flood control operation 
and solution of optimal release patterns, (3) building of the model of the 
decision-tree algorithm and neural-based decision-tree algorithm and extraction of 
the decision trees, and (4) comparison of the developed rules and the current rules. 
The developed methodology is applied to the Shihmen reservoir system. The 
optimal flood-control operation rules involve rules with respect to 
peak-flow-preceding stage and peak-flow-proceeding stage. 
 
Keywords: flood control, decision tree, neural network, reservoir release 
 
1.  Introduction 
To improve the multipurpose reservoir operation rules currently employed in 
Taiwan, this paper develops the operation rules (decision trees) with respect to flood 
control during typhoon periods using a novel neural-based decision-tree (NDT) 
algorithm. The NDT algorithm is employed to deal with the problems regarding the 
dependencies among attributes [Lee and Yen, 2002]. The NDT algorithm combines

3.1.  Study Area 
Shihmen Reservoir, located upstream of the Tahan River, is a multipurpose 
reservoir for irrigation, hydroelectric energy generation, public water supply, flood 
control, and tourism. The watershed covers an area of 763.4 km2. The elevations of 
the maximum storage for normal operation and for flood-mitigation operation are 245 
m (the corresponding water volume of 254 × 106 m3) and 248 m (280.8 × 106 m3), 
respectively. The dead level is at 195 m. Approximately 27 × 106 m3 of the storage is 
reserved for flood control operation during the typhoon periods [Hsu and Cheng, 
2002]. The capacity of the spillway and the spill-tunnel are 11,400 m3/s and 2,400 
m3/s, respectively. 
3.2.  Case Study 
•  Optimal input-output patterns 
Likewise, in order to generate the optimal data, the reservoir operation 
optimization model for flood control, built by Hsu and Wei [2007], is applied to the 
Shihmen reservoir system.  
This optimization model can identify the best amount of water released at each 
flood period. The objectives of this model include: (1) maximizing the peak flow 
reduction at selected downstream control points; and (2) meeting reservoir storage at 
the end of the flood. This model follows the reservoir release policies [WRA, 2002], 
which present the general flood operation norms for two flood stages.  
According to WRA [2002], the two stage intervals are: (1) peak-flow-preceding 
stage, which begins when inflow > 600 m3/s (= 2.16 × 106 m3/hr) and continues to 
the time of reaching the 90% of peak flow after the peak inflow occurs; and (2) 
peak-flow-proceeding stage, which begins with the end of previous stage to the end 
of flood. Here, this study assumes that the end of flood is at inflow < 400 m3/s (= 
1.44 × 106 m3/hr), which occurs at the peak-flow-proceeding stage.  
In this model, the time period is on an hourly basis. The San-Ying weir at a 
distance of 11.10 km downstream from Shihmen Reservoir is selected as the 
downstream control point. The target of reservoir storage at the end of the flood is 
set to be the elevation of 245 m (the maximum storage water level for normal 
periods). Data of 36 typhoons (1987–2004) are available. The optimal results of the 
total 1438 hourly data (36 typhoons), including 335 records of the 
peak-flow-preceding stage and 1103 records of the peak-flow- proceeding stage, can 
then serve as the training and testing datasets of the NDT model. 
•  NDT decision trees 
As mentioned, the release policies regarding the two flood stages are different. 
This study generates separately the decision trees by using the NDT model for the

where 1N′′ 4N′′  are the normalized dataset, and 1T′′ 4T′′  are the transferred dataset. 
From the two new datasets, the decision trees of the peak-flow-preceding stage 
and the peak-flow-proceeding stage can be obtained, respectively. 
•  Results 
Table 2 compares the accuracy of the two flood stages between the C5 algorithm 
and the NDT model. Results show that the NDT performs better than C5 for both the 
peak-flow-preceding and peak-flow-proceeding stages.  
4.  Conclusions 
In this paper, a neural-based decision-tree (NDT) algorithm has been developed 
to extract more accurate rules (decision trees). The major process of the developed 
NDT algorithm is the combination of the artificial neural network (ANN) 
technologies and the decision-tree algorithm (C5) capabilities. Although the NDT 
need more procedures compared with the C5. As soon as the neural-based 
decision-tree rules are obtained, the decision-making will be more accurate than the 
C5. 
Moreover, this study successfully presents a framework for the NDT model to 
address a multipurpose reservoir operation with respect to the operations of water 
supply and flood control. The application of the Shihmen reservoir operation verifies 
the superior performance of the NDT model in contrast to the traditional 
decision-tree algorithm (C5) and current operating rules. Consequently, the 
developed methodology demonstrates its feasibility.
