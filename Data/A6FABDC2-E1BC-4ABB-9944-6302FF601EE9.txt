TABLE I. DEFINITIONS FOR THE DCT AND DST MATRICES OF TYPES I, 
IV, V, AND VIII.  
An N´N matrix P is defined to be centrosymmetric if 
JPJ=P, where J is the N´N reversal matrix with ones on its 
antidiagonal entries and zeros elsewhere. It is known that any 
centrosymmetric matrix can be block-diagonalized to a 2´2 
block matrix using a unitary matrix [24]-[25]. Generalizing the 
definition of centrosymmetric property of matrices, a square 
matrix Q is defined as R-symmetric if RQR=Q where matrix 
R is an involution, i.e., R2=I. Any R-symmetric matrix can also 
be block-diagonalized to a 2´2 block matrix [26]-[27]. From 
these definitions, a J-symmetric matrix is centrosymmetric. In 
this paper, a K-symmetric matrix is called 
circular-centrosymmetric if K is the circular reversal matrix 
which will be defined in Sec. II. We will use the block 
diagonalization techniques of centrosymmetric and 
circular-centrosymmetric matrices to derive commuting 
matrices for DCTs and DSTs of types I, IV, V, and VIII. 
 
II. PRELIMINARIES 
Types I, IV, V, and VIII of the DCT and DST matrices will 
be used in this paper and are summarized in Table I [13]-[14]. 
In Table I, C and S represent the DCT and DST matrices, 
respectively, the subscript represents the matrix order, the 
superscript represents the type number, and ki (i=m or n), li 
(i=m or n) are defined, respectively, as:

It was shown that types I, IV, V, and VIII of the DCT and DST 
matrices are all involutions [13]. That is, 
IA =2 , (2) 
where I is the identity matrix and A denotes the DCT or DST 
matrix of type I, IV, V, or VIII. Therefore, types I, IV, V, and 
VIII of the DCT and DST matrices all have only two distinct 
eigenvalues: +1 and –1.  
The N´N DFT matrix F is defined as

F . (3) 
The DFT matrix F has only four distinct eigenvalues {1, -1, 
j, –j}, and the eigenvalue multiplicities of F were known [28]. 
In [10], Dickinson and Steiglitz introduced an N´N extended 
tridiagonal and symmetric matrix D which commutes with F, 
i.e., DF=FD. The definition of D is (only the nonzero entries 
are shown):

Since DF=FD, we can compute a Hermite-like orthonormal 
eigenvector basis of F from that of D [6]. Recently, Pei et al. [12] 
found another N´N extended tridiagonal and symmetric 
commuting matrix T of F. That N´N matrix T has its 
eigenvectors even closer to continuous Hermite functions and is 
given by (only the nonzero entries are shown):

The eigenvectors of matrix T are close to the continuous 
Hermite functions in the sense that the error norms between 
eigenvectors of T and samples of the corresponding continuous 
Hermite functions are small. Most of those error norms are 
smaller than the error norms of the corresponding eigenvectors 
of Dickinson-Steiglitz matrix D [12].This property that the 
eigenvectors of T are closer to the continuous Hermite 
functions can be used to define DFRFT, whose outputs are 
closer to samples of the continuous fractional Fourier transform 
in the sense of smaller root-mean-square error [12]. 
The N´N GDFT, also called as the odd-time odd-frequency 
DFT, is defined by [18]

The eigenvalue multiplicities of the GDFT matrix G have also 
been derived [18]. In [18], Tseng derived an N´N extended 
tridiagonal commuting matrix E of the GDFT matrix G from D 
in (4) (only the nonzero entries are shown):

Similarly, we can also obtain a new N´N extended tridiagonal 
commuting matrix W of the GDFT matrix G based on T in (5)  
(only the nonzero entries are shown):

From (24), we observe that the DFT matrix F is in the form 
of (12). Consequently, when N is even, F is 
circular-centrosymmetric. Therefore, we have the following 
property. 
Property 5: Let us assume that N is even. Then the 
transformed DFT matrix UFU is block diagonal and can be

Proof: See Appendix. # 
Similarly, when N is odd, F is also 
circular-centrosymmetric and we have the following property. 
Property 6: When N is odd, the transformed DFT matrix

Proof: The proof of this property is similar to that of 
Property 5 and is omitted. #

TABLE II. TRIDIAGONAL COMMUTING MATRICES BASED ON THE 
DICKINSON-STEIGLITZ MATRIX D AND THE T MATRIX OF THE N´N 
DCT AND DST MATRICES OF TYPES I AND V. 
 
2) In (33), if D is of size (2N+2)´(2N+2), D2 is of size N´N. 
From Property 9(ii) and (35), the N´N matrix JND2JN=D4 will 
commute with the N´N DST-I matrix INS , where JN is the N´N 
reversal matrix. That is, from the definition of D4 in (32) and 
the definition of D in (4), the following N´N tridiagonal matrix 
I,S
DM  is a new commuting matrix of the N´N DST-I matrix 
I
NS  based on the Dickinson-Steiglitz matrix D (only the 
tridiagonal entries are shown):

Similarly, we can use FT=TF with T defined in (5), 
Property 5, and the fact that the even-order DFT-commuting 
matrix T is also circular-centrosymmetric to derive: 
1) The second new N´N tridiagonal commuting matrix, 
denoted as I,CTM , of 
I
NC  based on T; and   
2) The second new N´N tridiagonal commuting matrix, 
denoted as I,STM , of 
I
NS  based on T. 
The resulting definitions of I,CTM  and 
I,S
TM  are given in 
Table II. 
On the other hand, when N is odd, it can be shown that the 
N´N Dickinson-Steiglitz DFT-commuting matrix D in (4) and 
the N´N DFT-commuting matrix T in (5) are both 
circular-centrosymmetric, and thus both of the transformed 
matrices UDU and UTU are block diagonal with U defined in 
(13). Consequently, if we employ similar method in previous 
discussions and use Property 6, we can obtain the following 
commuting matrices of the DCT-V and DST-V in Table II: 
1) two new independent N´N symmetric tridiagonal 
commuting matrices V,CDM  and 
V,C
TM  of the N´N DCT-V 
matrix VNC  based on the Dickinson-Steiglitz matrix D and the 
T matrix, respectively; and 
2) two new independent N´N symmetric tridiagonal 
commuting matrices V,SDM  and 
V,S
TM  of the N´N DST-V 
matrix VNS  based on the Dickinson-Steiglitz matrix D and the 
T matrix, respectively.

B. Novel Commuting Matrices of DCT-IV, DST-IV, 
DCT-VIII, and DST-VIII Based on the Matrices E and W 
When N is even, the N×N matrix E defined in (7) can be

ú
û
ù
ê
ë
é

JJEJJE
EE
E
34
43 , (44) 
where E3 and E4 are the N/2×N/2 submatrices of E. From 
Property 3 and (44), E is centrosymmetric. Therefore, from 
Property 4, the transformed matrix UrEUr is block diagonal, 
i.e., 
ú
û

EUUE , (45) 
where Ur is the N×N unitary matrix defined in (20). In (45), E1 
and E2 are both N/2´N/2 matrices, and are given, respectively, 
by: 
JEEE 431 += , (46) 
and  
432 JEJJEE -= . (47) 
Property 10: When N is even, if E in (45) is of size N×N, 
then (i) E1 in (45) commutes with the N/2´N/2 DST-IV matrix 
IV
2
NS , and (ii) JN/2E2JN/2, where E2 is given by (45), commutes 
with the N/2´N/2 DCT-IV matrix IV
2
NC . 
Proof: Using (30), (45), UrUr=I, and the fact that GE=EG, 
the proof of this property is similar to that of Property 9 and is 
omitted. # 
Therefore, from Property 10, we have the following two 
conclusions: 
1) In (45), if E is of size 2N´2N, E1 is of size N´N and 
commutes with the N´N DST-IV matrix IVNS . Therefore, from 
(46) as well as the definitions of E3 and E4 in (44), we obtain a 
new N´N tridiagonal commuting matrix, denoted as IV,SEM , of 
IV

We conjecture that the DCT and DST matrices of types II, 
III, VI, and VII are related to the DFT matrix F in (3) with 
time-index shift 1/2 or frequency-index shift 1/2. Unfortunately, 
both of the DFT matrix with time-index shift 1/2 and the DFT 
matrix with frequency-index shift 1/2 are neither 
centrosymmetric nor circular-centrosymmetric. Therefore, the 
block diagonalization approach to find commuting matrices for 
DCTs and DSTs of types I, IV, V, and VIII in this paper can not 
be directly applied to find those of types II, III, VI, and VII. 
However, it may still be possible to extend our method to find 
commuting matrices for DCTs and DSTs of types II, III, VI, 
and VII, which is an open research topic. Besides, we think it is 
more important to find commuting matrices for DCTs and 
DSTs of types I, IV, V, and VIII than to find those of types II, 
III, VI, and VII, because DCTs and DSTs of types II, III, VI, 
and VII have distinct eigenvalues [17] and thus have no 
eigenvector ambiguity problem. 
 
V. EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS OF DCT AND DST 
MATRICES 
A. Eigenvalues of DCT and DST Matrices 
The eigenvalue multiplicities of the DCT-I and DST-I were 
found in [19]. Besides, Tseng [18] derived the eigenvalue 
multiplicities of the DCT-IV and DST-IV. In fact, all of the 
eigenvalue multiplicities for the DCT and DST matrices of 
types I, IV, V, and VIII are the same, and are listed in Table IV. 
In the following, we only give the proof for the eigenvalue 
multiplicities of the DCT-V as an example. All of the 
eigenvalue multiplicities of the other DCT or DST matrices in 
Table IV can be proved similarly from corresponding 
eigenvalue multiplicities of the DFT or the GDFT. 
Property 11: The eigenvalue multiplicities of the N´N 
DCT-V matrix VNC  are given by Table IV. 
Proof: In (28), if the DFT matrix F is of order (4m+1), it can 
be seen that the multiplicities of eigenvalues of 1 and -1 of 
V
12 +mC  are the same as the multiplicities of eigenvalues 1 and 
-1, respectively, of the (4m+1)´(4m+1) matrix F. Therefore, 
from the eigenvalue multiplicities of the DFT matrix F in [28], 
the multiplicities of eigenvalues 1 and -1 of V 12 +mC  are (m+1) 
and m, respectively. We thus have the eigenvalue multiplicities 
of VNC  in Table IV when N is odd. When N is even, the 
multiplicities of VNC  in Table IV can be proved similarly. #

TABLE IV. EIGENVALUE MULTIPLICITIES OF THE N´N DCT AND DST 
MATRICES OF TYPES I, IV, V, AND VIII. 
 
B. Eigenvectors of DCT and DST Matrices 
First, we want to point out that all of the commuting 
matrices in Tables II and III are real and symmetric, and thus 
those commuting matrices have real and orthogonal 
eigenvectors. 
Property 12: Let M be a commuting matrix of A, i.e., 
MA=AM, where A represents the DCT matrix C or the DST 
matrix S of type I, IV, V, or VIII. Let El be the eigenspace of M 
corresponding to the eigenvlaue l, i.e., El={x|Mx=lx }. If 
xÎEl, then AxÎEl. 
Proof: See [29]. # 
From Property 12, if x is an eigenvector of M 
corresponding to an eigenvalue of multiplicity 1, then x is also 
an eigenvector of A. 
From [30], any symmetric and tridiagonal matrix with 
nonzero subdiagonal entries has distinct eigenvalues. In Tables 
II and III, except I,CTM  and 
VIII,S
WM , the commuting matrices 
of the DCT and DST matrices are symmetric and tridiagonal 
with nonzero subdiagonal entries. Therefore, except I,CTM  and 
VIII,S
WM , the commuting matrices in Table II and Table III have 
distinct eigenvalues, and, from Property 12, all of the 
eigenvectors of these commuting matrices are also eigenvectors 
of their corresponding DCT or DST matrix. For example, the 
N´N symmetric tridiagonal commuting matrix I,CDM  of the 
N´N DCT-I matrix INC  based on the Dickinson-Steiglitz 
matrix D in Table II has distinct eigenvalues and all of the 
eigenvectors of I,CDM  are also eigenvectors of 
I
NC . As to the 
two commuting matrices I,CTM  and 
VIII,S
WM , it can be shown 
that, except that the zero eigenvalue of both matrices is of 
multiplicity two, both matrices have distinct eigenvalues. 
Consequently, in order to compute the eigenvector set of the 
N´N DCT-I matrix INC  and the N´N DST-VIII matrix 
VIII
NS  
from their commuting matrices I,CTM  and 
VIII,S
WM , 
respectively, we must develop methods to find the eigenvectors 
of INC  and 
VIII
NS  in the eigenspaces corresponding to the zero 
eigenvalue of I,CTM  and 
VIII,S
WM , respectively. 
Property 13: The two N´1 orthogonal eigenvectors z1 and 
z2 of the N´N DCT-I matrix INC  in the eigenspace 
corresponding to the zero eigenvalue (with multiplicity 2) of its 
commuting matrix I,CTM  are

fewer/larger number of zero-crossings and thus represent 
low/high frequency eigenvectors of the DCT and DST. This 
fact may be useful to reduce computations for the DCT and 
DST of low-pass and high-pass signals. 
From the above discussion, the DFT Hermite-like 
eigenvectors can be generated from the Hermite-like 
eigenvectors of DCT/DST. The orthonormal Hermite-like 
eigenvectors of the DFT can be used as the discrete Hermite 
functions to define the discrete Hermite transform [32]-[33].

VI. DFRCT, DFRST, AND THEIR APPLICATIONS 
Again, let A denote the N´N DCT or DST matrix of type I, 
IV, V, or VIII. With eigenvectors and eigenvalues found in 
Section V, the N´N ath-order fractional transform matrix of A 
can be defined as [6]:

where vk is the normalized eigenvector of A and lk is its 
corresponding eigenvalue. In fact, lk is +1 or -1. Since la is not 
unique, Aa has multiplicity in choosing the ath power of its 
eigenvalues [17]. 
From (27), (28), (30), and (31), the relationships among the 
ath-order N´N DFRFT, fractional GDFT, and various types of 
DFRCTs and DFRSTs can be written as:

From (58) to (61), the DFRCTs and DFRSTs can be used to 
compute the DFRFT and the fractional GDFT of data vector x. 
For example, if N is even, the ath-order DFRFT of N´1 data 
vector x can be computed from the DFRCT-I and DFRST-I as

DCTs and DSTs may have better compression capability than 
the conventional DCTs and DSTs. Therefore, the fractional 
DCTs and DSTs can be applied in image transform coding for 
compression [17]. 
3) The fractional DCT and DST can be applied in image 
watermarking scheme to enhance security because their 
fractional parameters can be used as additional encryption keys 
[18]. 
 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have developed simple relationships 
among the DFT, the GDFT, as well as the types I, IV, V, and 
VIII of the DCT and DST matrices through unitary 
transformations. From those relationships, we derived the 
commuting matrices for each of the types I, IV, V, and VIII 
DCT and DST matrices from known commuting matrices of 
the DFT and the GDFT based on block diagonalizations of 
circular-centrosymmetric and centrosymmetric matrices. With 
these new commuting matrices, we can determine a unique 
orthonormal eigenvector set for each of their corresponding 
DCT or DST matrix. DFRCT and DFRST matrices can then be 
defined. Moreover, the DFRCT and DFRST were used to 
reduce the computations for the DFRFT and the fractional 
GDFT. 
We have used a block diagonalization technique to derive 
the commuting matrices of DCTs and DSTs from the existing 
DFT-commuting matrices. Except D and T, it is known that 
there are some higher order commuting matrices [7], which are 
circular-centrosymmetric, of the DFT. Using the block 
diagonalization technique of this paper, we can also obtain 
other DCT and DST commuting matrices from those higher 
order DFT-commuting matrices.
