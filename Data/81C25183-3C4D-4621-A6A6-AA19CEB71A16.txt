Abstract 
Application of bias potential to the photocatalytic decomposition of aniline in aqueous 
solution was studied under various light intensities, sintering temperatures of 
photoanode, solution pH and concentration of potassium chloride (as electrolyte). The 
photocatalytic decomposition of aniline was found to be enhanced with the 
application of bias potential because of the inhibition of the recombination of 
electron-hole pairs; however, the electrolysis of aniline became more dominant as the 
applying bias potential exceeding 1.0V. The application of bias potential provided 
higher photocatalytic decomposition of aniline in acidic solutions than that in alkaline 
solutions. Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) decomposition of aniline in alkaline solutions 
increased with the concentration of potassium chloride. However, decomposition of 
aniline was decreased with the presence of excessive potassium chloride because of 
the competitive adsorption of aniline, OH- and chloride ions on the active sites of 
TiO2.

 exhibited higher decomposition efficie- 
ncy than other electrolytes, such as NaCl, 
NaClO4, KNO3 and Na2SO4, for treating 
Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R (a reactive 
dye) by PEC process [10]. 
The objective of this study is to 
investigate the effect of applying bias 
potential on the enhancement of aniline 
decomposition by PEC process in aqu- 
eous solutions, and to discriminate the 
contribution from application of bias 
potential with regards to the decom- 
position of aniline by synergetic factor. 
The effects of various solution pH, bias 
potentials and concentrations of electro- 
lyte to PEC process were also described 
in this study. 
2. Experimental 
Chemicals used in this study were 
analytical grade without further purify- 
cation. The TiO2 suspension was prepared 
by adding 10 grams of Degussa P-25 
TiO2 in 150 ml of ethanol solution stirred 
by a magnetic stirrer for 30 minutes and 
sonicated for more than 6 hours. A 
titanium plate (a width of 180 mm, and a 
length of 100 mm) with 99.7% purity was 
etched by 6M hydrochloric acid at 75oC 
for an hour and subsequently washed by 
acetone, ethanol and de-ionized water in 
order to remove the organic species and 
particles from the surface of titanium 
plate. The titanium plate was then 
impregnated in the TiO2 suspension for 
one minute and pulled up slowly for 
several times, then dried at the room 
temperature. The TiO2 coated titanium 
plate was then put into the muffle furnace 
for sintering one hour. Since the 
purchased P25-TiO2 powder was intri- 
nsically provided activity for photo- 
catalysis, the residual ethanol on TiO2 
film during coating process should be 
burned by high temperature. Although 
sintering TiO2-Ti plate can move ethanol 
and other organic matters on TiO2, the 
sintering temperature would affect the 
surface area of TiO2 film because of 
aggregation of TiO2 particles. Hence, the 
effect of sintering temperature was tested 
from 150 to 550 . ℃ The decomposition of 
aniline by UV/TiO2 was decreased with 
increasing sintering temperature linearly 
from 60 to 45% conducted at aqueous 
solution of pH 11 and 10mg/L aniline 
solution. From the observation of SEM 
photographs, the particles of TiO2 were 
increasing with increasing sintering temp- 
erature and proved that the surface area 
altered by sintering temperature. For 
removing residual ethanol and decreasing 
surface area by sintering temperature, the 
moderate sintering temperature 350℃ 
was chosen for the following experi- 
ments. 
The schematic diagram of the PEC 
reactor designed in this study is shown in 
Figure 2. The PEC reactor was made of a 
Pyrex glass vessel of 1L volume with a 
quartz tube housing a Sparkie FL10W/ 
BLB mercury lamp with wavelength of 
365 nm and approximately 10 watts 
maximum output. The light intensity of 
mercury lamp was controlled by adju- 
sting the variable voltage transformer and 
was detected by the ILT 1400 Radio- 
 2
 than that conducted with solution pH 3.0. 
The higher decompositions in alkaline 
solutions are believed to be initiated by 
the formation of highly-oxidative hydro- 
xide radicals due to the presence of high 
concentrations of OH- ions which adsorb- 
ed on the surface of TiO2 film being 
reacted with excited holes (h+).

in aqueous solutions of various pH. 
As illustrated in Figure 4, decom- 
position of aniline by UV/TiO2 process 
was almost unchanged for experiments 
conducted with the presence of various 
KCl concentrations in acidic solution of 
pH 3.0. However, for experiments 
conducted in alkaline solution of pH 11.0, 
the decomposition of aniline by UV/TiO2 
process was increased with increasing 
KCl concentration until KCl concen- 
tration reached 0.001M and then 
decreased with further increase of KCl 
concentration. Chloride ions adsorbed on 
TiO2 film may react with positive holes 
to form Cl•, an oxidizing agent, to 
enhance aniline decomposition. However, 
the additions of excessive chloride ions 
inhibited aniline decomposition due to 
the competitive adsorption of chloride 
ions on the active sites of TiO2. These 
results are similar to those in the previous 
studies [9].

in aqueous solutions containing various KCl concen- 
trations. 
As depicted in Figure 5, no aniline 
decomposition was observed by bias/ 
TiO2 process with applied bias potential 
less than 1.0V; however, the decom- 
position of aniline was increased remark- 
ably with increasing bias potential for 
experiments conducted with applied bias 
potential higher than 1.0V. Experimental 
results of the aniline decomposition by 
bias/TiO2 process with the presence of 
various KCl concentrations from 0 to 
0.5M is illustrated in Figure 6. The 
decomposition of aniline by bias/TiO2 
process was not obvious with the 
application of 1.0V bias potential regard- 
less KCl concentration. However, the 
decomposition of aniline with 2.0V 
applied bias potential was enhanced with 
KCl concentration because both the 
solution conductivity and the current 
intensity were increased as the previous 
study [3]. Aniline was decomposed 
almost completely by bias/TiO2 process 
with applying 2.0V bias potential in 0.5M 
KCl solution.

 synergetic factor was less than those 
applying bias potential of lower voltages 
because electrolysis became the dominant 
mechanism for the decomposition of 
aniline.  
Effect of KCl concentration on the 
decomposition of aniline by UV/bias 
/TiO2 process in aqueous solutions of pH 
3.0 and 11.0 are shown in Figures 7. 
From the results of Figure 6 and 7, the 
decomposition of aniline by UV/bias/ 
TiO2 process was higher than bias/TiO2 
process with each KCl concentration. 
With the application of 2.0V bias poten- 
tial, aniline decomposition by UV/ 
bias/TiO2 process in aqueous solutions 
was increased with increasing KCl 
concentration possibly due to the inhib- 
ition of electron-hole pairs, similar to the 
results for bias/TiO2 process discussed 
previously. However, aniline decompo- 
sition was noticeably reduced in aqueous 
solution containing 0.5M KCl with 1.0V 
bias potential applied that attributing to 
the competitive adsorption between 
aniline, OH- and Cl- for the active sites of 
TiO2. Significant improvement of aniline 
decomposition by UV/bias/TiO2 process 
with applied bias potential of 2.0V in 
aqueous solution containing 0.5M KCl is 
contributed to the occurrence of electro- 
lytic decomposition of aniline discussed 
previously.

4. Conclusion 
The application of bias potential to photo- 
catalytic process inhibited the recom- 
bination of electron-hole pairs and 
enhanced the decomposition of aniline. 
However, electrolysis of aniline took 
place as applied bias potential exceeding 
1.0V and contributed part of decompo- 
sition of aniline to PEC process. By 
calculating the synergetic factor, the 
application of bias potential to UV/ 
bias/TiO2 process enhanced aniline 
decomposition more significantly in 
acidic solutions than that in alkaline 
solutions. Decomposition of aniline by 
UV/bias/TiO2 process was increased with
