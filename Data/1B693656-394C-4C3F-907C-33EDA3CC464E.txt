ABSTRACT 
This project successfully used inclined exposure technology to fabricate a wafer-level 3D micro beam 
splitter with a 45 ° optical grade surface (~1.4 mm thick). This project also tests the effect of solvent loss 
percentage of the SU-8 3035 polymer material (85.45 % solvent removal) to optimum surface roughness on 
the surface roughness of inclined surfaces. The smallest surface roughness achieved in the experiments using 
SU-8 3035 material with a thickness of 1.4 mm was less than 34 nm (400 µm X 400 µm area). And the 
reflective surface roughness of the molding beam-splitter is below 2 nm. The optical power of the fabricated 
beam splitter is about 60.55 % and 39.44 % for transmission and reflection, respectively. This type of micro 
beam-splitter can be used as a key component in Pico-projectors, Interferometers, bio detection systems, data 
storage systems, and linear encoder optic systems. And this novel technology also has the characteristics of 
high throughput and wafer-level assembly.

The index of refraction for glass is approximately 1.5. Therefore, Snell's Law can be used to calculate 
the deflection angle of refraction for interface 1:  
°=×=°=× 47.216 ;sin1.545)sin(1.556887 221 θθθ       (2) 
The deflection angle of refraction for interface 2 can be calculated as follows: 
°=×=°× 3255.3;sin145)-sin(47.1381.5 33 θθ        (3) 
Therefore, beam splitters fabricated by the molding process have a set deflection angle of approximately 
3.3255 °. However, beam splitters fabricated using the wafer-level method use a single substance and thus 
have no refractive light path. Therefore, when applying optics, the appropriate fabrication method can be 
selected according to development system requirements. 
In this project, different soft-bake times (12, 13, 14, 14.5, and 15 hrs) were tested (softbake at 105 ºC 
and PEB at 125 ºC for one hour) for controlling the solvent percentage of the polymer.  The calculation of 
the solvent percentage of the polymer is as follows: (Spin photoresist weight- Photoresist weight after 
softbake) / (Spin photoresist weight x (1-solid contents percentage of the photoresist)). 
How to get a perfect inclined surface is an important issue and topics for application in optics. The 
relationships of the solvent contents in the polymer material with structure surface roughness are important for 
polymer materials. 
 
FABRICATION PROCESS 
The inclined exposure technology used in this project was a previously developed technology and 
exposure system [7]. A system schematic was available for reference [7]. The UV exposure system used in 
this project employed an optical filter mounted parallel to a light outlet. This optical filter (OMEGA 
OPTICAL, PL 360LP) removed the portion of the light emitted by a mercury-vapor lamp with a wavelength 
of less than 365 nm, but admitted 405 nm and 436 nm UV light. The long wavelength light penetrates 
effectively into UV stabilized or pigmented films. This filter could partially eliminate diffraction on the top of 
the SU-8 structure.   
Because the SU-8 layer is thicker at the center of the wafers than at the edges, the gap between the 
photoresist and the mask is smaller at the center than at the edges; diffraction is therefore smaller at the center. 
In short, because the gap between the photoresist and mask is uneven, this project focuses on investigating the 
effect of process parameters on sidewall structure. For the sake of consistency, measurements were therefore 
taken only at the center of wafers; edge samples were not examined. 
 
-Beam-Splitter 1: Wafer Level Process 
The process steps designed in the project are shown in Fig. 4.  Figure 4a shows the spin coating of the 
SU-8 thick-film photoresist. Figure 4b-c shows the directed, inclined exposure steps following the soft bake. 
After the development process, Figure 4d was the completed micro prism structure. A sputtered thin metal 
layer was deposited on the inclined surface of one of the wafers (Fig. 4e). After the two wafers were aligned, 
hard-baking strengthened the adhesion between the interfaces of homogeneous substances, reduced the 
connection with the glass, and removed the upper wafer, completing the necessary beam-splitter structures 
(Fig. 4f). A detailed description of the process is provided below: 
- After the glass wafer was cleaned with sulfuric acid, a layer of Teflon was applied to the glass wafer 
surface. Because Teflon has a significantly lower surface energy (it is hydrophobic), applying it around 
the wafer prevents the photoresist from becoming mobile and producing overflow due to high 
temperatures during soft-baking. Therefore, photoresist SU-8 3035 can be controlled in the glass wafer. 
Teflon cures after heating at 180 ºC for 3 minutes. 
- SU-8 was spin coated on the glass wafer (Fig. 4a) by dripping approximately 10.5 g of SU-8 3035 on 
the wafer while it was hand spun accompanying with spin coater spinning at 160 rpm for 30 s. Using 
this method once, a 1.4 mm thick coat of SU-8 can be applied to the glass wafer. 
- Before soft-baking, the SU-8 photoresist was inspected for smoothness due to its effect on diffraction 
during exposure and inclined surface roughness. The purpose of soft-baking is to dry the solvent in the 
 6
×730 μm (Ra = 7.46 to 10.6 nm) surface area measurements. The results of this study, which measured both 
the incident surface and reflective surface, indicate that the reflective interface can achieve a smooth optical 
surface (Ra = 2nm) using the molding technique, while the incident surface roughness will be affected by the 
NOA plastic cutting method. The molding process uses the high molecular substance NOA-63 and does not 
require soft-baking or high-temperature fabrication. As long as the molding substance surface roughness is 
optical grade, the inclined surface produced will also be of optical grade (Fig. 9). Figure 9a is a picture of the 
fabricated 1X3 array micro prism. Figure 9b is a picture of a single micro prism (3 x 2 x 1.4 mm). Figure 9c is 
a lateral microscopic cross section of a beam splitter. 
The molding technique (Ra = 2 nm) can successfully solve the problems with wafer-level fabrication 
(Ra = 33.9 nm), including diffraction streaks, uneven photoresist spinning, and excessive fabrication time. As 
is clear from Table 3, which compares the roughness of micro mirrors across different studies, this study had 
better results and better product development potential in regards to structural thickness (1400 μm), roughness 
measurement surface area (400 X 400 μm, 730 X 730 μm), and roughness (3.36 to 33.9 nm). 
This project uses the test mechanism in Fig. 10a for demonstrating the efficiency of the fabricated beam 
splitter. It includes the He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) and beam profiler. Figure 10b is a picture of the real test 
system. Figure 10c is the beam splitter test pictures for split two orthogonal laser lights. Figure 11 shows the 
relative distribution of the power density of the input He-Ne laser source (power: 7.24 mW) (Fig. 11a), 
transmissive splitter light 1 (power: 3.47 mW) (Fig. 11b), and reflective splitter light 2 (power: 2.26 mW) (Fig. 
11c). It shows that the beam-splitter has about 20 % light loss due to the polymer material absorbance (T: 92 
%) and the roughness (incident surface and reflective surface). Table 2 indicates that incident surface 
roughness is poorer, decreasing incident optical coupling efficiency. From this experiment, the effect of the 
roughness on optical coupling effectiveness was estimated to reach as high as 12 %. The split light efficiency 
of the fabricated beam splitter is about T (60.55%) / R (39.44%). 
Therefore, the way that the optical component incident surface roughness affects optical incident 
efficiency becomes an extraordinarily interesting issue.  
 
CONCLUSIONS 
This project experimentally verified that special inclined exposure technology could be used to fabricate 
polymer beam-splitter devices, and offers an alternative to conventional mechanical processing. This project 
successfully used inclined exposure technology to fabricate a wafer-level 3D micro beam splitter with 45 ° 
optical grade surface (~1.4 mm thick). This project also tests the effect of solvent loss percentage of the SU-8 
3035 polymer material (85.45 % solvent remove) to optimum surface roughness on the surface roughness of 
inclined surfaces. The smallest surface roughness achieved in the experiments using SU-8 3035 material with 
a thickness of 1.4 mm was less than 34 nm (400 µm X 400 µm area). The beam-splitter structures created by 
the molding process can achieve a surface roughness of 7.46 nm within a 730 X 730μm measurement area and 
1.9 nm within a 400 µm X 400 µm measurement area. Compared with the SU-8 structures in other studies, the 
surface roughness for structures fabricated using the molding process is clearly better. 
The optical power of the fabricated beam splitter is about 60.55 % and 39.44 % for transmission and 
reflection, respectively. This type of micro beam-splitter can be used as a key component in Pico-projectors, 
Interferometers, bio detection systems, data storage systems, and linear encoder optic systems. And this novel 
technology also has the characteristics of high throughput and wafer-level assembly.

Abstract—This paper describes the design for a special 
k-type microprism structure for application in the lateral-type 
blu-ray semiconductor laser of an optical pickup head system. 
This design solves the current frontal type blu-ray 
semiconductor laser problem, and thus reduces the size of the 
optical pickup head. This study combines front- and back- 
inclined exposure technology to develop a k-type microprism 
structure. Thick film negative photoresist are used in this study 
as the main structural material. For obtaining the optimal 
structural surface roughness, the effect of solvent loss percentage 
of the polymer material was controlled. Besides, the bottom half 
of the k-type was generated through backside exposure to solve 
problems such as diffraction phenomena due to uneven 
photoresist surface during front-side inclined exposure. This 
design also avoids the problem of refractive index matching by 
omitting the step of filling the gap between the mask and the 
photo resistor with glycerol. For improving the roughness 
problem of the front-side inclined exposure, backside inclined 
exposure is implemented when fabricating a 45 ° polymer micro 
mirror. The use of front-side exposure for making the top half of 
the k-type solves the problem of undesirable surface roughness 
caused by insufficient light penetration during front-side inclined 
exposure. This paper utilizes front- and back-side inclined 
exposure technology to fabricate a 45 ° k-type polymer micro 
mirror with 15.2 and 12.4 nm (400 µm X 400 µm) roughness, 
respectively. The roughness level could meet the standards (λ/10, 
λ = 405 nm) of blue ray specifications. This type of micro prism 
can be used as a key component in Pico-projector, Interferometer, 
bio detection systems, data storage systems, and linear encoder 
optical systems. This novel technology also has the 
characteristics of high throughput and wafer-level assembly.

INTRODUCTION 
Generally, the micro-prism was fabricated by machining 
or injection molding methods. This is time consuming and 
expensive, especially for Pentagonal, Rochon, and Porro 
prisms. Develoing a new technology for fabricating the micro 
prism with high throughput, low cost, and high surface quality 
is a new challenge for MEMS technology. Recently, much 
research has been published on the wide range of applications 
of the SU-8 thick-film photoresist, and its use in fabricating 
many high aspect-ratio micro-optical structures [1-12]. 
C. H. Lee et al. (2007) [1] described the use of an 
ultra-thick SU-8 process (1 mm), analyzed the sidewall 
surface roughness after vertical exposure, and developed and 
compared the process with the silicon deep RIE (reactive ion 
etching) process. This study also used AFM to inspect an area 
of approximately 70 μm2 and found that the surface roughness 
of the SU-8 was approximately five times less than that of 
silicon after deep RIE etching. The author had proven the 
polymer material could get the better roughness than silicon 
etching. However, many optical applications require 45 ° 
inclined mirrors or prisms. W. J. Kang [2] compared the 
effects of different gaps, exposure doses, and substrate 
reflectivity on the structure and surface roughness; the best 
roughness obtained was approximately 50 to 60 nm, and the 
experimental thickness was approximately 70 μm. The author 
found that sidewall roughness increases with exposure dose or 
substrate reflectivity, showing that interface reflection can 
have a large impact on roughness. Thus, the research purpose 
of this paper was to present back-side (conformal mask) 
inclined exposure technology to resolve the above problems.  
K. Y. Hung et al. (2004) [3] proposed, for the first time, 
that inclined exposure technology could be used to fabricate 
thick-film micro-optical elements, and successfully used such 
elements in integrated optical pickup heads. The advantage of 
this approach is that it can avoid the alignment errors that may 
occur during the manual assembly of ordinary optical pickup 
heads, and it can also result in smaller pickup heads. Hung 
and colleagues [3] also used AFM to determine that the 
surface roughness of a small area of 25 μm2 was less than 7 
nm. It is apparent that researchers [4-11] have used many 
different exposure techniques to improve the roughness of 
thick-film SU-8 structures and meet the needs of relevant 
applications. Previous studies have indicated that the h-line 
(405 nm) wavelengths are better when manufacturing high 
aspect-ratio SU-8 structures [4]. By reducing the gap and the 
interface reflection of the substrate, it may be possible to 
reduce the sidewall roughness during perpendicular exposure. 
Fresnel or near-field diffraction in thick positive and 
negative resist for microstructures resulting from a small gap 
in contact or proximity printing has been previously 
investigated [4-6]. For resolving the above problems, Kim et 
al. [12] also used UV-LIGA-like processing, and 
manufactured a circular micro pinhole array structure of 
approximately 33.6 to 101 um through backside vertical 
exposure. Mert and Mutlu [13] used SU-8 as the gate 
dielectric layer, and produced a polymer thin-film transistor 
structure with the back-side and front-side exposure technique. 
The polymer thin-film transistor structure was applied in an 
optical display to simplify the number of masks required in 
the manufacturing process. Song et al. [14] produced a micro 
prism structure of different aperture through the back-side 
exposure technique, and explored the effect of Fraunhofer 
fabrication process of the k-type prism in detail.  The 
inclined exposure technology used in this paper was a 
previously developed technology and exposure system [5-6]. 
A system schematic was available for reference [5-6]. The UV 
exposure system used in this paper employed an optical filter 
mounted parallel to a light outlet.  This optical filter 
(OMEGA OPTICAL, PL 360LP) removed the portion of the 
light emitted by the mercury-vapor lamp with a wavelength of 
less than 365 nm, but admitted 405 nm and 436 nm UV light. 
The long wavelength light effectively penetrates UV 
stabilized or pigmented films.  This filter could partially 
eliminated diffraction on the top of the SU-8 structure. 
The detailed description of the manufacturing procedure 
shown in Fig. 3 is as below. 
- After cleaning the glass wafer, a layer of Chromium 
(Cr) was sputtered to make a masking layer, and was spin 
coated with an AZ-5214 photoresist to make a protective layer. 
The mask structure required for the backside exposure 
manufacturing process by exposure and development was 
defined (due to the near-field or Fresnel diffraction of the gap 
between the mask and photoresist, secondary surface reflection 
of the substrate), and the Wafer was etched with Cr-7. Finally, 
the photoresist was removed to obtain the conformal mask 
(Fig. 3a to d).   
- After the patterning of the Cr layer, a layer of Teflon 
was applied to the outer surface of the glass wafer. Because 
Teflon has a significantly lower surface energy (it is 
hydrophobic), applying it around the wafer prevents the 
photoresist from producing overflow due to high temperatures 
during soft-baking. Therefore, photoresist SU-8 3035 can be 
controlled in the glass wafer. Teflon cures after heating at 180 
ºC for 3 min (fig. 3d). 
- SU-8 was spin coated on the glass wafer (Fig. 3e) by 
dripping approximately 10.5 g of SU-8 3035 on the wafer 
while it was hand spun, accompanied with spin coater 
spinning at 160 rpm for 30 s. Using this method once, a 1.4 
mm thick coat of SU-8 can be applied to the glass wafer. 
Before soft-baking, the SU-8 photoresist was inspected for 
smoothness due to its effect on diffraction during exposure 
and inclined surface roughness. The purpose of soft-baking is 
to dry the solvent in the photoresist, because excessive solvent 
will cause caving or distortion to the surface during exposure. 
Therefore, time and temperature during soft-baking must be 
controlled precisely, with gradually increasing temperatures. 
The soft-baking temperature was gradually increased; starting 
at room temperature, the temperature was increased by 10 ℃ 
every 10 min. Once the temperature reached 105 ℃,the k-type 
prism was soft-baked for 14.5 hrs. 
After back- and front-side inclined exposure (Fig. 3f-g), 
post-exposure baking (125 ℃, one hr), and development, the 
designed micro k-type prism structures were obtained (Fig. 
3h). 
Because the SU-8 layer is thicker at the center of the 
chips than at the edges, the gap between the photoresist and 
the mask is smaller at the center than at the edges; diffraction 
is therefore smaller at the center. In short, because the gap 
between the photoresist and mask is uneven, this paper 
focuses on investigating the effect of process parameters on 
sidewall structure.  For the sake of consistency, 
measurements were therefore taken only at the center of chips; 
edge samples were not examined.

EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
Fig. 4 shows the pictures of the fabricated micro k-type 
prisms by optical microscope (Fig. 4a), and surface roughness 
results by a white light interferometer. The optimum 
roughness through backside exposure is about 12.4 nm (range 
~ 400 X 400 um) (Fig. 4b). The optimum roughness through 
frontside exposure is about 15.2 nm (range ~ 400 X 400 um) 
(Fig. 4c). The smallest surface roughness achieved by 
frontside exposure in experiments using SU-8 3035 with a 
thickness of 1.4 mm was about 36 nm when the softbake time 
was 14.5 hrs (area: 730 X 730 μm) (fig. 4d).  In this paper, 
the softbake temperature was 105℃, and post-exposure-bake 
(PEB) was 125℃ for one hr. The relationships of the solvent 
contents in the polymer material with structure surface 
roughness are important for optical application. The solvent 
removal percentage of the polymer was about 86.5 %; 
meaning that only about 13.5 % of the solvent contents 
remained, compared to the original. These are the optimum 
parameters applied to the structures. 
Table 1 shows a comparison of the roughness of micro 
structures fabricated across different studies. These results 
have proved that utilizing the back-side inclined exposure 
technology could resolve the diffraction problem resulting 
from the gap between the mask and the uneven thick-film 
photoresist, because the roughness through backside inclined 
exposure is lower than that of frontside exposure. And if the 
pattern size is the same, this technology could also save the 
mask. Therefore, this technology can be used to develop the 
inclined polymer micro prism structure with blue-ray surface 
successfully used front- and backside inclined exposure 
technology to fabricate a wafer-level k-type micro prism with 
45 ° optical grade surface (~1.4 mm thick). The smallest 
surface roughness achieved in the experiments using SU-8 
3035 material with a thickness of 1.4 mm was less than 12 nm 
(400µm X 400µm area) through backside inclined exposure 
technology. Backside inclined exposure was able improve the 
roughness problem (due to the near-field or Fresnel diffraction 
of the gap between mask and photoresist, secondary surface 
reflection of the substrate) of the front-side inclined exposure 
when fabricating a 45 ° polymer micro prism. The reflection 
of the fabricated k-type prism is also tested successfully. This 
type of micro prism can be used as a key component in 
Pico-projector, Interferometer, bio detection systems, data 
storage systems, and linear encoder optical systems. This 
novel technology al has the characteristics of high
