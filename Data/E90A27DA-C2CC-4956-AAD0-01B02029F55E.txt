Abstract 
 
A new polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) structure that 
has no requirement for a high-precision scanning stage or controller and is based on a 
thermal light source to has an enhanced axial resolution is developed for the simultaneous 
measurements of the thickness, mean group refractive index, apparent phase retardation 
and optical axis orientation of a linear birefringent material. Additionally, a new method 
in directly measuring the group extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices and group 
birefringence is developed and it could be used to inspect and verify the corresponding 
parameters of a sample. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the proposed structure is 
the first system capable of measuring all of the optical parameters of a linear birefringent 
material and modifying the apparent phase retardation as the actual one.

simultaneous measurements of the thickness, mean group refractive index, apparent 
phase retardation and optical axis orientation of a single-layer birefringent sample. The 
group extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices of the sample can then be measured 
by a new method based on that the difference between the group extraordinary and 
ordinary refractive indices can be distinguished by a high-resolution PS-OCT.  
 
2. Basic principles of new PS-OCT structure for simultaneous measurements of 
various optical parameters 
 
In a conventional OCT system, the signal is established and referred to define the 
locations of the detected signal from the sample arm and reference arm, therefore the 
high-precision scanning stage and controller should be employed to locate the fringe and 
also affect the resolution of the system critically. However, the novel system needn’t 
utilize the high-precision scanning stage or stage controller [10] to clarify signals as long 
as the scanning stage moves in the constant velocity. Fig. 1 presents a schematic 
illustration of the PS-OCT structure developed in this study. Essentially, the basic 
structure of this study is a modified conventional PS-OCT system, while a fixed mirror as 
illustrated in Fig.1 which regards as the fixed reference signal is inserted. From the fixed 
reference signal and the known speed of the scanning stage, the location of the fringe 
could be obtained just by the information from the oscilloscope. The function of the new 
PS-OCT structure is to measure the multiple optical parameters of a single-layer 
multiple-order birefringent sample. 
 
Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of PS-OCT system 
 
2.1 Thickness and mean group refractive index measurements 
In the proposed structure, the interferometric signals received by Detector (1) are 
sufficient to measure the thickness and mean group refractive index of a linear 
birefringent sample. The beam from the thermal light source (a halogen lamp) is split by 
a non-polarizing beam splitter (NPBS(1)) into two beams. One beam, namely Beam (A), 
serves as a fixed beam for reference and is passed through a compensation plate and is 
 6

calibration process: (A) no sample; (B) with sample 
 
Clearly, the location of Peak A is fixed since it corresponds to the immobile 
reference mirror. Hence, this location can be used as the reference point during optical 
path scanning. In Fig. 2(2)(A) and (B) , the time differences Tns, i.e. between peaks A and 
R0, and Tst, i.e. between peaks A and S, correspond to the optical path differences 
between cases with and without the sample, respectively. Furthermore, TS is the time 
difference between S and RS and is proportional to the optical path length within the 
sample itself. Therefore, the thickness of the sample can be obtained directly from 
 
( )s ns std T V T T V= ∆ × = − ×                                               (1) 
 
where V is the velocity of the scanning stage. In general, the refractive index of a 
birefringent material is given by the mean value of the extraordinary refractive index, ne, 
and the ordinary refractive index, no [12]. In conventional OCT, the scan is accomplished 
by the group delay line to make the measured refractive index called the group refractive 
index. Accordingly, the mean group refractive index of the current sample can be 
determined by

2.2 Apparent phase retardation and optical axis orientation measurements 
The right-hand side of the PS-OCT structure shown in Fig. 1 enables the apparent 
phase retardation and optical axis orientation of the linear birefringent sample to be 
measured. It is assumed that the polarization state of the light reflected from the reference 
arm (Beam (C)) is linearly polarized with an angle of precisely 45° with respect to the 
horizontal plane and that the light has both equal amplitude and equal phase in the two 
orthogonal polarization directions. When Beam (B), with a circular polarization state, 
illuminates the sample, the birefringence of the sample causes the reflected light to have 
an elliptical polarization generally. The reflected light then interferes with the same 
optical path from Beam (C). The PBS splits the resulting interferometric signal into two

the material usually has non-vanishing group dispersion (GD) [16]:

λ λ
= = −                                                (7) 
 
As a broadband beam double passing the dispersive material with length, ds, the 
coherence length is extended as [16]: 
 
( )22,c dis c sl l GD d λ= + ⋅ ⋅∆                                                (8) 
 
From Eq. (8), the width of the coherence envelope of the scan would be increased by 
group dispersion. In other words, dispersion degrades the axial resolution and fringe 
visibility in low coherence interferometer. In order to obtain the optimum resolution and 
avoid the reduction of fringe visibility, the dispersion of the sample has to be 
compensated. Assuming that GD is constant within the wavelength range, ∆λ and the 
effects of higher order derivatives of the refractive index can be neglected, dispersion can 
be compensated by inserting a dispersion compensating plate into the reference arm to 
balance the dispersion in measured materials. This plate must satisfy the following 
condition [16]: 
 
pl pl s sGD d GD d=                                                        (9) 
 
where subscript in pl and s refer to the compensating plate and the sample, respectively. 
Hence, the interferometric fringe with different case of dispersion effect could be 
improved by compensating plates with the corresponding dispersion effect. 
 
2.4 Directly measuring the birefringence 
For the ultrahigh resolution of this new PS-OCT, the difference between the optical 
paths with the group extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices in the birefringent 
sample could be distinguished. From the mentioned method, the orientation of the optical 
axis is defined and able to be controlled. If the QWP in the sample arm is removed, the 
incident beam upon the sample would become the pure linear polarization, and then the 
sample is rotated to make the optical axis of the sample corresponding tothe polarization 
of the incident light. As shown in Fig. 3, the optical axis orientation of the quarter 
wave-plate served as the sample is rotated at 90° and 0°, and the interferometric fringes 
of the lower surface of the sample corresponding to the group extraordinary and ordinary 
refractive indices are observed respectively.

Fig. 4 The fringe of the rear surface of the multi-order QWP in horizontal and vertical 
channels 
 
Conclusively, two different fringes corresponding to the group extraordinary and 
ordinary refractive indices could be obtained in the interferometric signal of the rear 
surface of the specimen by the PSOCT with ultrahigh resolution. The path difference 
between the two peaks, DBirefringence ( = (ne)group x ds  – (no)group x ds = (∆n)group x ds), as 
shown in Fig. 4 is the optical path difference between the path in the specimen with the 
group extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices. If the thickness of the sample, ds is 
known and the optical path difference, DBirefringence is measured, the group birefringence, 
(∆n)group = (ne)group - (no)group could be calculated by

2.5 Direct calculation and modification for exactly apparent phase retardation 
In general, birefringent materials can be either multiple-order or zero-order plates. 
The phase retardation of multiple-order birefringent materials is given by: 
 
( )22 e om d n n
pi
β pi
λ
+ = −                                                 (13) 
 
where β is the apparent phase retardation (0 to 2pi), (ne-no) is the birefringence of the 
optical material at a particular wavelength λ, m is the order of the multiple-order 
birefringent material, and d is the thickness of the material. If d(ne-no) is less than a 
wavelength, the order is zero, which means m = 0. In the zero-order case, if the phase 
refractive index, nphase is obtained by employing focus tracking technique [17, 18], and 
the thickness and apparent retardance are all defined, the extraordinary and ordinary 
refractive indices of the linear birefringence sample can be calculated separately 
according to Eq. (13) and the relationship nphase = (ne + no) / 2 as

wavelength ranges of 450-700 nm and achromatic only over a few hundred nanometers 
were inserted in the reference and sample arms, respectively. Before experiments, it 
should be noticed that the air gap between the sample and the sample stage should be 
eliminated in order to prevent the unwanted reflected light from the sample stage. 
 
3.1 Axial resolution of new PS-OCT and dispersion compensation 
A key objective of the PS-OCT structure presented in this study is to improve the 
axial resolution. Accordingly, the current experimental PS-OCT system uses a thermal 
light source with a central wavelength of 603 nm, a spectral bandwidth of ∆λ = 210 nm, 
and a calculated coherence length of 0.96 µm. As shown in Fig. 5(B), the actual 
coherence length of the thermal light source is found experimentally to be 1 µm. For the 
higher axial resolution in the new PS-OCT by using the thermal light source, the further 
parameters of optical materials including the group extraordinary and ordinary refractive 
indices with the little difference between them can be exclusively distinguished. This is 
one of uniqueness in this study.

situation occurs while the compensating plate is the glass plate with 450 µm thickness. In 
experiment for the measurement in the sample with 575 µm thickness, the axial 
resolution still attain to 1.63 µm after the dispersion compensation. 
 
3.2 Thickness and mean group refractive index measurements 
The performance of the PS-OCT structure in measuring the thickness and refractive 
index of optical samples was evaluated using two different samples, namely a D263T 
glass plate and a multiple-order QWP (CVI, QWPM-633-10-4-R15). Prior to the 
measurement process, the two-step calibration procedure described in Section 2.1 was 
performed. Fig. 7 illustrates the demodulated scanning interferometric signals acquired at 
Detector (1) with and without the sample, respectively.

Fig. 7. Demodulated signals obtained at Detector (1) with and without the sample 
 
The D263T glass plate with known thickness, 150 µm (as reported by the 
manufacturer) was placed on the sample stage and the scanning stage was then driven to 
match the optical path length of the sample. The three time differences, i.e. Tns, Tst and Ts, 
were then calculated and substituted into Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) to compute the D263T glass 
plate thickness, ds, and group refractive index, n, respectively. The measurement 
procedure was repeated 10 times. As a result, the experimental results are 149.38 µm in 
thickness and 1.5439 in group refractive index. In general, the refractive index of an 
optical sample varies with the wavelength of the incident light. The central wavelength of 
the halogen thermal light source used to illuminate the PS-OCT system is approximately 
603 nm. Therefore, the theoretical value of the refractive index at a wavelength of 603 
nm can be calculated using the Sellmeier equation [19]. The theoretical value of the 
group refractive index of the D263T glass plate at a wavelength of 603 nm is calculated 
to be 1.5397. The error between the measured thickness value and the theoretical value is 
0.42%, while that between the measured group refractive index and the manufacturer’s 
specification is 0.28%.  
The same experimental procedure was then repeated using the multiple-order QWP

QWP (CVI, QWP0-633-04-4-R10) (B) multiple-order QWP (CVI, 
QWPM-633-10-4-R15) 
 
The same experimental procedure was repeated to measure the apparent phase 
retardation of the multiple-order QWP. The measured results are presented in Fig. 8(B). 
In this case, the average apparent phase retardation of the multiple-order QWP is found to 
be 83.41° when both the compensation plate and the 633 nm band-pass filter are used. 
However, when the incident light is unfiltered, and the measurement procedure is 
performed using only the compensation plate, the measured value of the apparent phase 
retardation falls to 68.71°. When neither the band-pass filter nor the compensation plate 
is used, the apparent phase retardation value falls further to 90°. Comparing Fig. 8(A) and 
8(B), it is evident that the phase retardation measurement errors for the zero-order QWP 
are considerably less than those for the multiple-order QWP at the wide range of 
wavelength. This result is reasonable since the zero-order QWP has a substantially lower 
dependence on the wavelength than the multiple-order waveplate. Furthermore, the 
significant difference noted between the measurement results obtained with and without 
the 633 nm band-pass filter, respectively, arises because the dynamic range of the 
extracted apparent phase retardation is limited to 0° ~ 90°. However, as will be discussed 
(A)

3.4 Direct measurement in group ne and no 
In this experiment, the multi-order QWP is regarded as the sample. For the 
measured thickness, it confirms that the optical difference due to the discrepancy between 
(ne)group and (no)group should be recognized in this new PS-OCT with ultrahigh resolution. 
After the optical axis orientation is obtained and under control, the QWP in the sample is 
removed to generate the linearly polarized light sending in the sample, and steps that 
presented in Section 2.5 are progressed. The sample is rotated to make the optical path 
length in the sample corresponding to the group extraordinary refractive index or 
ordinary refractive index multiplied by the thickness respectively. Finally, the measured 
(ne)group and (no)group are obtained as 1.7329 with the standard deviation, 0.0012 and 
1.5635 with the standard deviation, 0.0011 respectively, and the difference in refractive 
indices between (ne)group and (no)group called the group birefringence can be calculated as 
0.00968. The errors of measured (ne)group and (no)group compared to the theoretical values 
are 0.20 % and 0.19 % respectively. They are in good agreements with the optical 
parameters in the crystal quartz.  
Because of the ultrahigh axis resolution of this new PS-OCT, two peaks in the 
signal could be found out while the interferometric fringe of the rear surface of the 
multi-order QWP is observed particularly after dispersion compensated. It could be 
considered as the effect induced by the birefringence of the material, and it is supposed 
that this phenomenon should appear in the uniform element produced by manufacturers 
specially. Two peaks in the fringe correspond to the extraordinary and ordinary refractive 
indices respectively. The optical path difference between these two peaks is measured as 
5.62 µm in the average of measurements, which represents the optical path difference 
induced by the group extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices (∆ngroup × ds). The 
birefringence could be calculated by Eq. (15) and the measured thickness, 573.98 µm is 
substituted, therefore the average measured ∆ngroup is derived as 0.00979. As compared 
with the theoretical value of 0.00987, the error is 0.77%. 
 
3.5 Modification for exactly apparent phase retardation 
The sections above have described the measurement procedures for obtaining the 
thickness, mean group refractive index, apparent phase retardation, optical axis 
orientation, group extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices of a birefringent sample. 
Once these optical parameters are known, the exact apparent phase retardation of the 
sample can be modified by the proposed method. The relevant procedure is described in 
the following for the multiple-order QWP (CVI, QWPM-633-10-4-R15). 
Comparing the measured group extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices with 
those of common uniaxial birefringent crystals, it is found that the only material with 
comparable extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices is quartz. Next step, the mean 
group refractive index could be varied as phase one to attain the apparent retardance 
measured by PS-OCT by the property of the crystal (np/ng ~ 0.985). Given the measured 
values of the thickness, modified mean phase refractive index, and confined apparent 
phase retardation of the multiple-order QWP, Eq. (13) and Eq. (15) were used to 
calculate the possible birefringence (∆n) and the corresponding extraordinary and 
ordinary refractive indices (ne and no), respectively, for assumed orders of m = 0~10. The 
corresponding results are summarized in Table 2. Due to the limited dynamic range of the 
apparent phase retardation measurement in Eq. (4), the possible apparent phase 
retardations in four quadrants are considered. In Table 2, the estimated values of ∆n, ne, 
and no are presented only for the first and Fourth quadrants. Since the birefringence of 
quartz is known as ∆n = 0.0091, the results presented in Table 2 suggest that the order of 
the sample is 8, the corresponding apparent phase retardations is 248.71°, and the 
 20
error arises because of an imperfect compensation for the dispersion of the broadband 
thermal light source.

The method in direct measurement to obtain the group extraordinary and ordinary 
refractive indices and group birefringence provides capability to inspect and verify the 
corresponding parameters of a sample. The direct measurement could be achieved for the 
sample with sufficient thickness and birefringence that makes the optical path difference 
between group extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices distinguished. In this system, 
the resolution of the optical path difference between group extraordinary and ordinary 
refractive indices is around 1~1.5 µm. The present results have demonstrated that while 
the measured thickness, mean refractive index, and optical axis orientation values are 
sufficiently accurate, the current PS-OCT structure only attains acceptably accurate 
values of the phase retardation when the QWP has a zero order and the retardation is 
restricted to the range of 0 to 90°.  For larger phase retardation beyond 90°, the 
measured result has to be modified by the method in this study. Accordingly, a future 
study will develop an enhanced PS-OCT structure capable not only of obtaining 
high-precision simultaneous measurements of the thickness, mean refractive index and 
optical axis orientation of zero-order and multiple-order linear birefringent QWPs, but 
also accurate measurements of the phase retardation of such optical samples over the full 
range of 0 to 360°.
