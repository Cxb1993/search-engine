I. Introduction
I-i. Background
 Under the pressure of the globalization, many 
regions in the world are suffering from 
demolishing local identities. Scale merit takes 
over the inter-city competition once region is 
dominated by a common sense of value. This 
will make large city to earn more superiority 
compared to small cities. This is leading to the 
depopulation of the rural area. Regional 
development of today strongly needs the 
incubation of industry taking full advantage of 
the features and characters of each city and 
region. 
 In order to have regional development, there 
needs 1) recognition of the regional resources, 
2) sharing of such recognition among the 
citizen, and 3) have proper management body 
and strategy to enhance such resources.  
 Also, it is very important to understand how 
people recognize the features of each region in 
the current society where many cultures are 
merging and changing. 
In this research, two tourist area each in 
Taiwan and Japan were chosen to clarify the 
problems in the process of the formation and 
renewal of the formation of regional image 
taking tourism industry as examples. Also, 
target area were chosen to make a comparison 
between countries in the different phase of 
cultural conditions were chosen.
I-ii. Purpose of this Research
This research aims to clarify the topic shown 
below.
a)Relation between space and regional image
b)Structural problem in sharing recognition 
and management of the region
c)Problem in renewal process of the 
recognition-sharing-management cycle
Through comparison of cases in two societies 
with different intensities of cultural merging:
d) Suggestion for formation of shared image 
and management of regional development in 
Taiwan

Summary
 Topics of research are about the recognition and utilization of the regional image. For the 
continuous regional development, it is important for region to attain the proper positioning of 
their image, or status, in their mother cultural groups. This was hypothesis and research was 
mainly focused on tourism industries. Also, since cultural groups themselves are merging 
worldwide today, case in Taiwan were chosen as the case of more merged society than Japan, 
and case in Japan were chosen as older tourist area. From investigation in Shengsing station 
area, Miaoli prefecture, following results were earned in each step of status creation, 
recognition, sharing, and management. Recognition: There are physical landscape elements to 
represent the regional image and relations between their composition and visitor’s impression 
were clarified. Sharing: Structural difficulties to have shared image is clarified by investigating 
three different groups of storeowners defined by time length of their businesses. Their interests 
and understandings showed missmatch in between the groups. Management: Each groups look 
for further support of government, which conflict to the speculation of government to create 
regional organization to handle their own management to develop the area self-reliantly. After 
the research in Taiwan, Investigation in Yufuin area, Oita Prefecture, Japan were done. Here 
clarified that it is difficult to keep the organization and clear sharing of the image as shop 
owners of second generation simultaneously act their own attempt to improve regions. Also, as a 
result of site investigation, it is clarified that sharing of the image were perhaps understood 
lightly on purpose where some shops clearly is free riding to the high-class image of this region.
Keywords; Cultural Status, Regional Development, Landscape Element, Sharing of the 
Regional Image, Conflict of Interests, Tourism, Taiwan, Japan
 One the other hand, the definition of region is 
changing as our society transit from steady, 
separated status where region, community, and 
cultures were matching, to the network society 
where culture and community are merged into 
network.8) (figure 3)
Figure 5. Shift to the Trans-Cultural Society
 Also, as Agrafiotis had pointed out, mother cultures 
itself is merging, too.9) 
 Currently, movements to form ethnic identities 
in Taiwan is significant. Though it is highly 
probable that further merge between different 
cultural groups will proceed even more. This is 
not only because of the mixture in domestic 
ethnic groups, but there also are influence of 
cultures oversea. Statics of 2006 tells that 
international marriage ratio out of total mariage 
in Taiwan is 16.77%.10) Under such 
circumstances, “museum like” preservation, or 
“commune like” exclusive groups will only be 
a temporary resistance to the big movement of 
merging cultures. We should find a new status 
from the part of the network of plural culture 
mixture. (figure6)

Around Shengsing Station
 The target area, 
surrounding area of 
Shengsing station, Sanyi, 
Miaoli is the tourist place 
with many visitors. Here 
runs a disused truck of 
railway which now is called 
Old Mountain Line. Station 
building was built at 1912 and preserved till 
today. This line was disused on 1998 as new

II-iv. Composition of Landscape Elements
 At the experiment, notable landscape elements 
were also asked to examinees. Most commonly 
appeared elements were; Wooden materials, 
bricks, stone materials, natural green and group 
of human.
To prepare to see the relation between 
landscape element and human feelings, video 
clips used for SD methods were once again 
investigated. Here 1 frame out of every 3 
seconds of video were taken out and then each 
frame were cut into 100 pixels. Numbers of 
pixels which more than half of their area is 
occupied by certain element were counted and 
recorded.

III-i Analyses of door-to-door Survey
The survey  took place on 20. May. 2011 and on 
23. June. 2011. 42 shops exists in this area, and 
29 shops did accept the interview. 
 Regarding the interviewees, age of the traders 
were rather high, since almost half of them 
grew up near Shengshing train station and have 
found the business in one generation. Many of 
them have studied outside the region and have 
came back to Shengshing area to start business.

 Through the further survey, it became obvious 
that large potion of the traders who have 
started the business in the station live in 
Shengshing area. About half of the traders are 
outsiders of Shengshing; however, other half of

III-iv. Observation of Tourists
　In Sanyi Old Mountain Line Shengshing 
train station, many families, school friends and 
couples can be found. They come from various 
areas, and according to the Questionnaires, 
visitors are mostly young people who have 
accessibility in transportation. They view of the 
train station as a valuable place to visit since 
many of the have visited the place as a Second 
time or more. Their sojourn time is within 1 
day, since there is no place to overnight in this 
area.

　Charts of the analysis show that the tourists 
are interested in the culture of Shengsing 
station area; however, they tend to be 
interested in railroad more than Hakka culture. 
III-v. Difference in Recognition between 
Tourists and Store Owners 
 Here problem became clear that what is 
demanded by tourist and what is being 
provided by tourism business owners are 
different. Further more, there are gap in the 
understandings and misunderstanding between 
each of three major related bodies, local 
government, tourists, and business owners.
 This structural difficulty is restricting the 
Shengsing station area to form regional 
characteristics.
Figure 18. Relation between three bodies
IV. Renewal of Recognition After the Cycle 
of Recognition, Sharing, and Management
IV-1. Corporate Development
  Yufuin is one of the 
most famous places for 
tourism in Japan. Every 
year, 4.23 million 
people visit there out of 
11,667population.50)
Previously, Yufuin was 
less-noted since 
although having hot 
springs with rich 
quantity of hot water, the land was quite thin. 
In the year of 1924, Professor Seiroku Honda 
has delivered lecture, “Plan to Develop 
Yufuin,” and it marked a start of upgrading the 
area as a resort district. In 1970, the plan of 
constructing golf field raised, but is was 
prevented by the protest movement of nature 
preservation. Number of the owners of 
Japanese style inns and young traders of 
tourism established organization to consider 
Yufuin, and aggressively supported the 
development of the region. The problem in the 
region has created the title for the theme for the 
traders of tourism to think about the image of 
the region. In 1971, Japanese style inn owners 
in the age of 30-40 traveled Europe as a 
training to examine the fact pattern of spa and 
health resort. There, the owners find a model of 
region creating based on “ green, space 
tranquility, in Badenweiler, Germany. Such a 
model reach fruition as “ concept of healthy

create a mechanism to share the regional image 
with the new coming shop owners from 
outside. General office of tourism in Yufuin is 
anticipated to play these roles.

Figure 21. Some shops has design, but their 
understanding of regional image seems to be different
Figure 22. This building seems to pay no attention to the 
enhancement of regional image29)
V. Comparison Analysis of the Regional 
Development Cycle between Trans-Cultural 
Society and Inter-Cultural Society
 After going through the comparison research 
between Shengsing station area and Yufuin 
area, it became clear of the importance of the 
proper recognition of the regional resources.
 Strong leadership must be taken by someone 
in order to share the image and organize the 
management body of the region. In case of 
Shengsing, customers do not necessary 
demandes the Hakka culture related activities 
or goods. Understanding of needs and proposal 
of regional theme must be done with sincere 
efforts. And Regional image must be contents 
driven. This includes both activity and space.
VI. Conclusion
From investigation in Shengsing station area, 
Miaoli prefecture, following results were 
earned in each step of status creation, 
recognition, sharing, and management. 
Recognition: There are physical landscape 
elements to represent the regional image and 
relations between their composition and 
visitor’s impression were clarified. 
Sharing: Structural difficulties to have shared 
image is clarified by investigating three 
different groups of storeowners defined by 
time length of their businesses. Their interests 
and understandings showed missmatch in 
between the groups. 
Management: Each groups look for further 
support of government, which conflict to the 
speculation of government to create regional 
organization to handle their own management 
to develop the area self-reliantly. 
After the research in Taiwan, Investigation in 
Yufuin area, Oita Prefecture, Japan were done. 
Here clarified that it is difficult to keep the 
organization and clear sharing of the image as 
shop owners of second generation 
simultaneously act their own attempt to 
improve regions. Also, as a result of site 
investigation, it is clarified that sharing of the 
image were perhaps understood lightly on 
purpose where some shops clearly is free 
riding to the high-class image of this region.
 It is suggested that in order to improve the 
tourism industry in Shengsing station area, not 
only the sharing of the regional development 
image through communication is important, 
but continuous management of the image and 
presence of organization with proper power of 
influence to maintain such recognition among 
all is important.

Proposal of the Need of “Simple” Ekistics Grid for 
Introductive Purpose
Nobuyuki Sekiguchi
The author is Assistant Professor in Department of 
Architecture, National United University of Taiwan 
and a member of the World Society for Ekistics 
(WSE). This text proposes based on the reaction of 
the students in Taiwan to the introduction of the 
Science of Human Settlements. Those are, 1) need 
to make adjustment of Ekistics Grid according to 
each cultural  zone, and 2) need of the Ekistics Grid 
to be simple in order to serve its role as eye-opener 
for students, planners and designers.
Newly Opened Course in Taiwan
A new half a year lecture course of the Science of 
Human Settlements was opened in the spring 
semester of the academic year 2009. This course 
was offered as a selective course for the 1st year 
students of the master course program of 
architecture. 5 out of 7 students had chosen and 
completed this course.

“Resolution” of the Grid
 If we consider the Ekistics Grid as an eye-opener to 
holistic thinking for students, planners, and 
designers, I believe that Ekistics Grid, at least in its 
introductive stage, should be simple and easy to use.
Promotion of the further research to update the 
Grid is important, but at the same time, we have to 
design the “entry” to the study of Ekistics. The value 
of Ekistics is not only in its knowledge, but the 
framework of thinking it offers, since Ekistics is in 
meta-level in comparison to the specified study fields. 
Thus it is important for students not only to learn 
through lecture, but also learn though utilization. If we 
are to hold some short seminar to introduce Ekistics, 
I think we should put in some opportunity for 
participants to apply Ekistics Grid in some way, and 
program should designed to offer such chance.
On the other hand, for the practical use of 
Ekistics, the contents of the grid shall be more 
precise and up-to date. 
Allow me to use the metaphor of rulers, as seen in 
the figure .4.
When one becomes in touch with Ekistics in its entry 
level, more important is to apply it in their use. In 
such case, the graduation of the scale does not 
necessary have to be precise. When one wish to 
apply Ekistics in their professional planning, design, 
or research, then the scale is require to be accurate 
and precise. 
Figure 2. Purpose of using Ekistics Grid is different in 
the level of application 
Important role of Ekisitcs at this stage is to offer the 
means for users to understand the situation properly 
in order to formulate the solution. Finally at the 
research level, Ekisticians shall discuss how to 
change the pitch of the graduation or the shape of 
the scale.
    The role of Ekistics required in each stage shall be 
different.
The Need of Feedback System
In order to keep drawing attention of the future 
possible Ekisticians, continuous update of the 
Science of Human Settlement is demanded as 
pointed out by many colleagues. Ekistics must be 
attractive in their scientific framework as well as their 
practical usability.     
    Thus, promotion of education and research shall 
move simultaneously. Outcomes of the research shall 
give feedback to the “scales” in use, and also the 
local input shall be considered in order to update the 
Ekistics Grid. (Figure.3)
   
Conclusion
First attempts of introducing Ekistics to Taiwan 
through lecture course succeeded in one point, and 
facing to difficulty in anther. Success was that the 
concept of Ekistics is considered to be valid today, 
which gave strong insights to students. Difficulty was 
to keep the attractions 
   I shall rearrange the course to add in some 
opportunity for students to have an experience of the 
application of Ekistics. Further more, I would like to 
propose the need to design the introductive 
workshop program that participants can learn about 
the Ekistics through the actual use.
