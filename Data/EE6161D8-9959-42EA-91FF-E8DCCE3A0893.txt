most frequently observed textures in weak gelation of 
crystallizable linear polymers. We find that the 
gelation has to do with the spatiotemporal evolution 
of the so-called ＇coherent structure＇—the non-
localized, fibril nucleation via the fluctuation 
instability and fibril growth coupled with a 
cooperatively coarsening concentration wave—and is a 
direct consequence of the spinodal crystallization 
far from equilibrium in the solution. The present 
result rejects the common opinion that the gelation 
is nothing more than the percolation problems and 
poses an interesting question about the entropy-
driven crystallization. On the other hand, we also 
find the fibrillar networks and the spherulite 
assemblies textures in response to the kinetic 
distinction between instability/spinodal and 
metastability/nucleation of the polymer 
crystallization and prove the morphogenetic 
transition in between. Moreover, it comes as a 
surprise when such a transition exhibits a spinodal 
singularity that reveals a mean-field-
like ＇mesoscopic＇ phase transition behavior.

Viewed from this direction, unlike the past concern that the polymer gelation is the cross-links 
of a large number of microstructures (microcrystal, helical structure, molecular compound, 
etc.),7,8 now should be reinterpreted as the jamming transition induced by the 
self-organization/assembly of them.28 However, in conventional jamming systems, the objects 
which allow much more precise tracing of arrested dynamics are model colloids and granular 
materials. One must contend with the fact that the polymer can have a huge variety of structural 
states at different length scales. Lack of morphogenetic detail makes it difficult to investigate 
the dynamic evolution on the polymer weak gelation. 
1.1. Polymer Gels with Fibrillar Network 
Forming a fibrillar network is a very widespread phenomenon in the polymer gels and the 
low-molecular gelators. It is accepted for the gelators that the fibrillar structure is due to the 
crystalline fibril branching20,21 and may be depicted by the solidification.29 Naturally, this seems 
logical for polymer, because the crystallization does occur in most polymer gels.7-9 However, a 
similar observation does not automatically guarantee a similar origin and process. The 
solidification has no thought for the entanglement complexity of polymers, not to mention the 
fact that the mechanism does not by itself expect—how does the topological connectivity occur?  
Obviously, the crux lies in how the fibril growth brings the topological connectivity on the 
mesoscale.  
There are two mechanisms for the thermoreversible gelation with fibril structure. One is 
the bond percolation by fibril junctions (a typical phase transformation in polymer solutions); 
another is the self-organization/assembly by fibril aggregation/evolution (an non-equilibrium 
phenomenon). However, the experiments based upon equilibrium thermodynamics are not 
possible to tell which one is most nearly in agreement with the fact. Thus, we proposed a 
judgment. If the gelation is characterized by the fibril nucleation covering over the entire 
transient network instantaneously (i.e., the bonding probability depends only on the nucleation 
kinetics), it is a percolation process; if not, it relies on when and how do the molecular 
topological entanglement pin the self-organizing/ assembling processes. Tracing the evolving 
fibrils by the depolarized small-angle light scattering (d-SALS) technique can provide an 
access to model the system in questions.17 In this report, we use a qualitatively reliable 
full-scattering-pattern analysis to perform a systematic stepwise survey of the gelation 
process.14,15 By reconstructing the whole process, the present work would not only answer how 
the fibrils self-organize into the network but also clarify what the nature of the morphogenesis 
in that process is.

“observable” spinodal crystallization of polymers.13 In contrast to the fibrillar networks, since 
the polymer chain folds into a crystalline grain, the self-assembling mechanism provides the 
only available means to form a “network” without the topological entanglement. By using the 
time-resolved depolarized small-angle light scattering (d-SALS) with the scattering modeling 
approach, the cartoon in Figure 1 vividly portrays the process, in which the crystalline grains 
self-assemble into compact spherical clusters (spherulites) and further pack these clusters into a 
jammed solid.14-18  
Obviously, the above argument shows that the two textures effectively means a striking 
manifestation of the kinetics at the beginning. In this report, we also consider whether a 
morphogenetic transition may occur, if the morphogenetic differentiation results from the 
kinetic distinction between instability and metastability. We start with the spherulite assemblies, 
which we have made clear during these years and named “nucleation gel” according to its 
kinetics, 14-18 and focus our attention to what may happen in the early stage. All results offer 
valuable insights into the theoretical treatment and dynamic experiments of polymer weak 
gelation in the future.

2.4. Time-Resolved FT-IR 
The time-resolved infrared spectrum was measured at a resolution of 1 cm-1 with a Nicolet 
6700 FT-IR Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The s-PS/o-xylene solution was 
enclosed in a HT-32 heated demountable cell with 0.5 mm pathlength spacer inserted between 
two KBr windows. The crystal form of the s-PS fibril is δ phase with a 21 helical conformation 
corresponding to a regular TTG+G+ sequence,31 and the conformational-sensitive band of the 
sequence is at 572 cm-1;31-33 so the wavenumber range scanned was set 568~ 576 cm-1 to trace 
the band. 
 8
(ca. 1 µm ). Undoubtedly, the present pattern should be richer in structure.  In early works,35 it 
is implicitly assumed that the structure scattering can be excluded from d-SALS. Later, we 
knew that the structural information does exist and can be extracted by our scattering modeling 
approach.14,15 
For the scattering from an evolving hierarchical structure, giving the explicit analytical 
form of the scattering pattern is rather difficult or even impossible. Instead, the scattering 
modeling is a compromising phenomenological approach which can lead to a better 
understanding of the interrelation/interaction between scatterers at different timing and 
hierarchy during the process. Before building a realistic model, we would like to define two 
terms: form factor and structure factor. The form factor is the scattering intensity for a scatterer 
alone and is related to the shape and scattered ability of it. The structure factor is scattering 
intensity for the interference of the scatterers and is referred to the spatial arrangement of them. 
Besides, the form factor also describes the scatterers’ level in the hierarchical structure. If the 
density-density correlation functions of two structures have the convolution relationship,36,37 
the sub one names as the form factor. Let us return to our main subject. Considering many 
crystalline fibrils create a topological connectivity and then show a highly correlated evolution. 
The model needs two form factors to define the fibrils and their correlation; one more structure 
factor is needed to characterize the large-scale inhomogeneities of the network, as shown in 
Figure 2 (c). 
 
Figure 3 Scattering modeling of the fibrillar network. 
Two mechanisms were considered: the fibril aggregation/branching and the fluctuation 
coupling. The former is not new21,38 and holds for the following case, as shown in Figure 3 top. 
First, either an aggregate or a branching object requires “an” origin,21 and the fractal 
characteristic should be detected and analyzed. Secondly, if the cluster is formed by the 
aggregation, it will be a two-stage process, i.e., the fibril growth and then aggregation. In the

where σ  is the ratio of the cluster size to their average distance (if 1σ = , the clusters are 
closely packed; if 1σ < , the clusters are close but not in contact; if 1σ > , the clusters 
overlap).38 Considering the loose assembly of the clusters, 1σ < seems to be reasonableness; 
thus we set 0.67σ = ( 0.42γ = ).

theoretical (right half) scattering patterns. 
For the remainder time-dependent parameters, formally, there may be not just one solution but 
a range, corresponding to “one” scattering pattern (two-dimensional, space case). The validity 
of the modeling is limited to the selection of these parameters, because the results may reflect 
in part the way in which those were selected. Nevertheless, it is possible with appropriate 
constraints during analysis, like refer to the real-space SEM micrograph. On the other hand,

would be considered later.

3.1.3. Comparison with the Previous Opinion 
From a phase transition point of view, the experimentalists attempt to answer the origin of 
the polymer fibrillar network.42-47 A fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics, the 
kinetics, and the mechanism of the gelation is therefore of great importance. However, recent 
studies on thermodynamic equilibrium microstructures (junctions) and morphologies 
(networks)7-9 and on global kinetics45-47 do not fill the gap in our knowledge on the formation 
mechanism. Some experiments have been carried out in order to search for the factors 
controlling the microstructures and morphologies.42-44 The point is that the gelation is due to the 
competition-cooperation between the crystallization and the phase separation in the polymer 
solution. Namely, the process is initiated via the spinodal decomposition and subsequent 
crystallization in the bi-continuous polymer-rich phase.45,46 The main evidence comes from 
analyzing the wide-angle light scattering (WALS) data of the early-stage concentration 
fluctuations in terms of Cahn’s spinodal theory.49 While there can be no doubt about the 
existence of the fluctuation, we divide on the relevance of the mechanism. 
First, the extrapolation spinodal point determined in Cahn’s way is kinetic, but whether the 
thermodynamic miscibility gaps are precisely those observed in kinetic experiment is a 
problem.42-47 Secondly, the light scattering peak provides access to an analysis of the spinodal 
structure at each evolution stage—fluctuation, transition, and coarsening,50 but no observed 
spinodal structure may be questionable. In a number of experiments, especially those time trace 
observed by the WALS,42-47 the crystallization/gelation intervenes at the fluctuation stage of the 
spinodal decomposition, leading to a "physical pinning." Such the pinning effect retains the 
initial fluctuation structure (wavelength ~0.5 µm) in the final gel morphologies which 
coincidentally agrees with our observation in Sec. 3.1.2. Clearly, even though the early-stage 
fluctuation is approximately described by Cahn’s spinodal theory, its formation might be of a 
rather different origin. Now that our “coherent” picture could rationalize the previous 
observation, we might argue that the complex concept of the competition-cooperation of the 
multi-phase transitions are not required in order to explain the experimental data presented. 
3.1.4. When Does the Coherent Structure Occur? 
We may safely assume that its condition is related to cL  (the critical length of the fibril 
nucleus) and OZξ , which give a criterion when combined with the intrinsic persistence length of 
the polymer, p , as c OZp L ξ< < . When c OZL ξ , the details of the fluctuation do not matter, 
and then the “classical” crystalline nucleus forms and grows locally. If c OZL ξ< , the nucleating 
fibrils seem roughly equivalent to the diffuse nucleus of Cahn and Hilliard's non-classical 
 16
 
Figure 9 (a) Real-time trace of the conformational-sensitive IR band of the regular TTG+G+ sequence of 
the s-PS (572 -1cm ) in the early stage nucleation. (b) Entropy-driven crystallization in the polymer 
solution. Left: The excluded volume effect leads to a crowded environment, and the maximum of the 
conformational entropy leads to an inaccessible region or a closed chain loop to confine the degree of 
translational freedom of the solvent molecules (the depleting spheres). Middle: The solvents act as “side 
chain” affixed to the hard-sphere chain to stabilize the self-organizing helix, thus favoring the global 
maximum of the system's entropy. Right: Again, the free-volume per depleting sphere is larger in the 
ordered (the crystal) than in the disordered (the self-organizing helix) phase. 
 The integrated IR intensity of the regular TTG+G+ conformation emerged immediately 
after quenching, increased linearly before any indication of forming observable fibrils 
( nuclt t< ), and approached only asymptotically the gelation stage. Superficially, this 
observation seems to agree: whereas the polymer crystal is partially built up with the 
intramolecular periodic structure, when a polymer molecule is possible to self-organize into 
the regular sequence, the next "crystallization" through intermolecular packing of these 
sequences must proceed in a more continuous and collective fashion as the "spinodal" 
process.61 
However, two deep questions should be addressed. First, what does drive the 
self-organization within a polymer molecule? And secondly why does the solution show up as a 
long-lived metastable state, despite its fluctuation instability? The answers to both questions 
may lie in understanding how the s-PS chain behaves in the solution. Nevertheless, the 
 18
Clearly, the only way to heighten the spheres' free volume (translational entropy) at constant 
internal energy is to allow the significant expansion of the hard-sphere chain, while its 
conformational entropy is more or less lost. However, whether the translational entropy can 
have an appreciable effect on the expansion of the hard-sphere chain should depend on the 
polymer concentration.  We predict that the maximum translational entropy could be obtained 
near the overlap threshold ( [ ] ~1Cη ), enough to outweigh the loss in the conformational 
entropy. Even so, the stability of the expanded hard-sphere chain still has to depend on its 
persistence time. The stabilization can be done in two ways: either by a higher activation energy 
barrier for the rotational isomerization, or by the special chemical forces such as the π-π 
interactions, as shown in Figure 9 (b) middle. Furthermore, as the self-organizing helices grow 
beyond certain critical length, the depletion attraction caused by them would be sufficiently 
large to induce the fluctuation instability, as shown in Figure 9 (b) right. We finally have 
known why the solution shows up as the long-lived metastable state. 
3.2. Morphogenetic Transition in Polymer Weak Gelation 
Now we consider whether a morphogenetic transition may occur, if the morphogenetic 
differentiation results from the kinetic distinction between instability and metastability. We 
start with the spherulite assemblies, which we have made clear during these years and named 
“nucleation gel” according to its kinetics, 14-17 and focus our attention to what may happen in the 
early stage. All results offer valuable insights into the theoretical treatment and dynamic 
experiments of polymer weak gelation in the future. 
3.2.1. Experimental Evidence for Morphogenetic Transition 
Figure 1 (See Sec. 1) shows all the details of the gelation process.14-17 Let us focus on 
the cluster nucleation-growth stage, t <3000 s. For a (category 2) birefringent sphere,15 i.e., 
spherical cluster assembled by crystalline grains, its characteristic size, a , is estimated by the 
peak locus in the intensity map, mq , in terms of 4 ma q∼ ,15,35 and its growth kinetics is 
identified by the simple power-law relationship ( )a t tα∼ ; meanwhile, the critical cluster size, 
ca , can extrapolate the power-law relationship back to the nucleation time, nt ( determined by

decreases as the cluster grows larger. We set 0.64A =  for the close-packed but still remaining 
complete disorder74 and set 0 0.2µma =  by our SEM micrograph14 and by Park et al.'s result 
for the core-shell structure of a PVDF chain in the dilute solution ( 0.22µmgR ∼ , 
1.45h gR R ∼ ).75 As regards the shape of the critical cluster, we assume a Boltzmann sigmoidal 
form: ( ) ( ) ( )03 1 X X dXf fD X d d e −⎡ ⎤= + − +⎣ ⎦ , where 1fd =  for a ramified fractal (chain-like) 
cluster.70 Figure 10 (b) shows cn  (thick dash line) with the best-fitted result of ca  (thick line) 
and the corresponding changes in D  and φ , respectively. Clearly, the diffusion-controlled 
kinetics at low temperature can be associated with a continuous and collective spinodal 
nucleation. 
Having mentioned the cluster spinodal nucleation, we raise further questions to be 
explored: First, at first glance, the crystalline grains perhaps might seem to be a short-range 
attractive colloidal system, but it is not so (i.e., long-range interaction nature of the mean-field 
system). Secondly, the singularity behavior allows an extrapolation to locate the lower limit of 
the thermodynamic metastability of cluster nucleation, i.e., the so-called “pseudospinodal,” 76-78 
but, beyond this limit, what is the specific texture showed? The answer to these questions may 
be the evidence of the morphogenetic transition we are looking for.

highlight the contribution of the fibrillar network (see each color dash-dotted lines with labels 
and in the inset). Indeed, the increases of the mean-square Debye-Bueche fluctuation, 2DBη , 
and fibrilφ indicated the fibrillar network emerged gradually. A more visual description of the 
modeling result is given in Figure 4b, where the larger, isolated critical clusters, ca , are 
dispersed and embedded in the fibrillar network with smaller mesh size, DBξ (Debye-Bueche 
correlation length), thereby providing evidence of the direct elastic effect on the nucleating 
clusters.

Another intriguing observation is that unlike the singularity shown in the mesoscopic 
scale, a smooth crossover is between the instable fringed-micelle crystal and the metastable 
chain-folded lamellar crystal, see Figure 12 (b), the fibril length, L , and 0a . Even though 
we have made this priori assumption, as with many long-standing problems, their coexistence 
and crossover is deceptively normal. We must remember the historically so-called “ lδ  
catastrophe” which causes a singular behavior of the average lamellar thickness at a finite 
supercooling in Hoffman-Lauritzen secondary nucleation theory.30 Additionally, in terms of the 
mean-field nature of polymers, the same is true of Cahn-Hilliard spinodal nucleation theory (as 
a crystal fold surface should be rough/diffuse far from equilibrium).52 One possible explanation 
 24
4. Conclusions 
4.1. The origin of the coherency 
The issue can date back to the previous controversies about “spinodal-assisted 
crystallization” in bulk polymers. In Ryan et al.'s SAXS experiment (also see in Kaji et al.), 
they found a fluctuation-induced anomalous scattering at the early-stage crystallization which 
implies the observation of a spontaneous fluctuation process rather than a sudden nucleation 
event. The heart of a fierce debate is Ryan et al.’s concept— the ordered and disordered chain 
conformations are two “thermodynamic phases.” The minutes at the Cambridge meeting on 
Physical Chemistry in the Mesoscopic Regime in 1999 represent the state of the debates at that 
time. Leaving the disputes about whether the polymer crystallization is in need for a new theory 
aside, Ryan et al.’s theory is believed to be out of touch with reality. 
In view of this, by taking into account an additional correlation effect induced by 
topological entanglement of polymers, Muthukumar gives a reasonable overall account of Ryan 
et al.'s disputed data.5 In his model, however, the nucleation instability is embodied in the 
“intrinsic” properties of polymers (entanglement). Just because the nucleation instability is 
observed “far from equilibrium.,” it does not follow that the universal and fundamental aspect 
of the metastability should be ignored in the polymer crystallization. 
Both Ryan et al.'s thermodynamic theory and Muthukumar’s kinetics model proceed from 
“intrinsic” properties and introduce added complexity in the crystallization theory of polymers. 
For this issue, our evidence shows another possibility: the “extrinsic” fluctuations can be strong 
enough to vanish the metastability and then the spinodal crystallization can occur. In other 
words, we just regard the observed spinodal crystallization as a key feature of the coherency. 
The relevant theoretical basis has been developed by Cavagna et al. 
4.2. Implication and interpretation of spinodal crystallization 
In the first, we would like to draw your attention to some previous controversies about 
“spinodal-assisted crystallization” in polymers. Ryan et al.'s SAXS experiment (also see in Kaji 
et al.) and thermodynamic spinodal-assisted crystallization theory are in the heart of a fierce 
debate. The minutes at the Cambridge meeting on Physical Chemistry in the Mesoscopic 
Regime in 1999 represent the state of the debates at that time. Leaving the disputes about 
whether the polymer crystallization is in need for a new theory aside, the SAXS experiments 
clearly demonstrate the existence of a prior density fluctuation (like a split-up of the crystal 
 26
iii. If it is real, what will be the spinodal structure of the polymer crystal? 
Since it is impossible in a brief space to discuss the wide range of phenomena, for first two 
questions, Cavagna et al.'s and Trudu et al.'s works have provided some useful information; 
whereas for the third question, we would like to draw your attention to the reply in Sec. 4.3. 
Having underscored that the thermoreversible gelation is not what should be expected 
from the superficial morphology, we ought to compare reflections on similarities and 
differences between the reviewer and us. We all agree that the gelation in fibrillar network 
systems is not linked with the classical percolation networks but with the 
self-organizing/assembling processes of long-chain polymers or low-molecular gelators far 
from equilibrium, although there is considerable argument about the detail of the processes due 
to the differences in studying object aspects. Reviewer believes that owing to the perturbations 
far from equilibrium, the interface instability and the secondary nucleation give rise to the 
fibrillar branch, thereby forming a fibrillar network. But we concerned about whether under 
certain circumstances there is a further possibility which the effects of the perturbations can be 
strong enough to make metastable states become unstable and then the fibrillar network can 
form. 
4.3. New Position of Fringed­Micelle Model 
Today we all know very well that the preferred polymer crystal is not that with the lowest 
free energy (like an extended-chain crystal), but the kinetically dominant metastable crystal 
(like the chain-folded lamellar crystal). While the definition of metastability is based on the 
consideration of kinetics, and the perturbation far from equilibrium introduces an added 
complexity linked with the existence of the metastability limit, it is then entirely reasonable to 
ask what the spinodal structure of the polymer crystal will be. 
For this question, we have no totally new picture but a new interpretation on the almost 
forgotten fringed-micelle crystal model. It is not hard to imagine that if the chain-folding is a 
most efficient way of packing polymer chains, the fringed-micelle model is just the opposite. 
Since in addition to the high cumulative strain energy in the fringed end (even much higher than 
the folded surface), the micelle could collapse due to the entropy effect of overhanging loose 
chains on the sterically nervous transition-interface-layers, such the structure cannot be stable 
without any stabilizing effect.

On the basis of the Meeten et al.’s theory, Q  is ascribed to both mean-square optical anisotropy, 
2δ〈 〉 , and the mean-square density fluctuation, 2η〈 〉 . A problem now arises: due to the excess 
scattering intensity of which arises from 2η〈 〉 , 45 2( )HvI q q°  shows a divergent behavior in high- q  
regime, and Q  does not converge to a constant. To avoid this problem, we may expediently 
neglect the isotropic term in eqs 10 and 11 to calculate the equivalent invariant, anQ , and

an sQ δ φ µ∝ = ∆  (a.16) 
where sφ  is the volume fraction of the birefringent sphere. Thus, we can clarify the relative 
contribution of the volume fraction of the growing new phase on the scaled form factor. 
In previous work we demonstrated ( )sphereHvP qa  to show the universal feature of the depolarized 
scattering from a birefringent sphere, but some deviate at 4qa < . At that time, we incorrectly 
related the deviation to the long-range correlation of the dispersed spheres according to the 
observation that the excess scattering intensity is biased with 2q . Later we knew that the observed 
excess scattering yields important information concerning the elastic background.
