Abstract-We propose an enhanced 3PEKE (Three-party 
Encrypted Key Exchange) scheme, in which both two 
parties/clients act as the roles upon the relationship of 
exchange-messages, who are employed in the traditional 3PEKE 
(Three-party Encrypted Key Exchange) schemes [2-5,9,12-17,19, 
23, 26, 27]. Our approach can improve the security of traditional 
3PEKE scheme by adding digital time-stamp. By this way, we can 
effectively against the password guessing attack as well as replay 
attack. 
Index Terms-3PEKE; key exchange protocol; authentication; 
security; time-stamp 
1. INTRODUCTION 
For 3PEKE protocols, they have two main indexes for 
describing the performance of system. One is 'transmission 
round' and the other is 'computation complexity' [4, 16]. A 
transmission round includes all independent steps that can be 
sent and received during the same time interval. The 
computation complexity represents how heavy cryptographic 
operations such as symmetric encryption or one-way hash 
function are adopted in the protocol [4, 16, 28]. Therefore, a 
3PEKE can be operated in less time with the help of 
transmitting the messages in parallel or adopting fewer 
cryptographic operations [4, 16, 28]. As the result of the 
3PEKE protocol was simplicity and convenience, many 
investigations [2-5, 9, 13-19, 23, 26, 27] have been focused on 
the 3PEKE research. 
In 1995, Steiner et at. [24] proposed 3PEKE protocol 
(STW-3PEKE). However, in 2000, Lin et at. [14] showed that 
STW-3PEKE suffers not only undetectable on-line password 
guessing attacks but also off-line password guessing attacks. 
Thus, Lin et at. [14, 15] proposed an improved 3PEKE 
protocol (LSH-3PEKE) using server's public key to prevent 
these attacks. Nevertheless, the public key technologies need to

Grant No. NSC99-2221-E-468-0l1. 
665 
take more computation times if it is applied to 3PEKE protocol. 
Subsequently, in 2004, Chang et al. [2] proposed the 
three-party encrypted key exchange (ECC-3PEKE) protocol 
which is quite different from the protocols [14, 24]. They 
proposed scheme was without using the server's public keys. 
However, they claimed that their proposed ECC-3PEKE 
scheme is secure, efficient, and practical. But in 2008, Yoon et 
at. [26] showed that ECC-3PEKE scheme [2] cannot 
effectively resist undetectable on-line password guessing 
attacks. They proposed an enhancement scheme [26] which can 
solve the security problem. Notwithstanding, the method 
proposed by Yo on et at. [26] still cannot effectively resist 
undetectable on-line password guessing attacks [18]. Thus, in 
2009, Lo et at. [18] shown that Y oon et at. ' s scheme was 
unsecure and proposed a new 3 PEKE scheme shown in 
reference [18]. But the roles for exchanging messages in Lo et 
at. 's 3PEKE scheme [18] are different from the traditional 
3PEKE schemes [2-5, 9, 12-17, 19, 23, 26, 27]. Therefore, in 
2010, Chen et at. [6] proposed scheme can against password 
guessing attacks and obtain the same quality of computation 
complexity, in which the roles for exchanging messages are 
similar to these schemes [2-5, 9, 12-17, 19,23,26,27]. 
Because human's memory is limited, people always use 
the easily remembered word or memorable things as the secret 
password. However, it will let the traditional 3PEKE schemes 
[2-5, 9, 12-17, 19, 23, 26, 27] becoming more vulnerable, 
because it is easily suffered from password guessing attacks. 
Further, the main goal of attacker will be to obtain the session 
key. Thus, in 1995, Y. Ding et at. [7] claim that the password 
guessing attacks on 3PEKE protocols can be classified into 
Then, client A generates the new time-stamp tAi where 
k 
i = (1,2,3, ... ) and computes t'SA = tSA ffi tAi. And then, 
i = 1 
client A computesEpWA(NAEf)PWAEf)t'SA)' EpWA(PWAEf)tA)' 
enough bits, they will be needed to pending some bits in order 
to fit the same length of NA . Next, client A sends these 
messages along with IDA' IDB and IDs to client B. 
2) Similarly, Client B also generates two random numbers RB 
and computes and 
KBS=N;"(mo<p). Similarly, client B also generates the new 
time-stamp tBi where i = (1,2,3, .. . ) and computes t'SB = 
k 
tSB ffi tBi 
i = 1 
And then, client B 
computes EpWB(NBEf)PWBEf)t'SB) '  EpWB ( PWBEf)tB), F;/rB) 
bits, they will be needed to pending some bits in order to fit the 
same length of Ns. Next, client B sends these computation 
results along with these received messages to server S. 
3) As soon as server S receives the messages sent from client 
B, server S can 
decrypt EpWA (NAEf)PWAEf)t'sJ EpWB (NBEf)PWBEf)t'SB) 
EpWA ( PWAEf)tA) and EpWB ( PWBEf)tB) by using the 
corresponding passwords and to 
NBEf)PWBEf)t'SB ' PWAEf)tAi and PWBEf)tBi by using the 
corresponding passwords p� and PWs, and corresponding the 
time-stamps t'sAand t'SB. If these passed verifications, then the 
time-stamps t'SA and t'SB will replace with the original 
time-stamps tSA and tSB. Then, server S derive rA and rs from 
the one-way trapdoor hash functions FS(rA) andFs(rs) . And 
then, server S computes K AS = N A
'A (mod p) and 
667 
Next, server S then verifies that the received hash values 
procedure between both client A and client B are successful, 
then the server S will generate a random number Rs. And the 
R R server S can compute both NA S (modp) and NB S (modp) 
from random Rs .  Next, server S will compute the four 
R messages NA S N Rs , B 
procedures are unsuccessful, the server S can break off these 
procedures. Finally, server S will send back these four 
messages to client B. 
4) As long as client B receives the messages sent from server 
S, client B can retrieves NA Rs from the received messages and 
authenticates server S by verifying the result of 
server S is successful, client B then compute both of the 
Finally, client B will send the residual messages along with 
fK (IDs, K) to Client A. 
5) As soon as client A receives the messages sent from client 
B, client A first retrieves NB Rs from the received messages and 
authenticates server S by verifying the result of 
fK (IDA' IDB, K AS' N B RS ) . If the authentication procedure for AS 
server S is successful, client A will compute the session key 
K = (N/s )RI (modp) and authenticate client B by verifying 
the result of fK (IDs, K). If authentication procedure for client 
and client B can also authenticate the server S, as well as client 
A and client B can authenticate each other. 
2) Prevent to the password guessing attacks 
Generally, an attacker may use the 
detectable/undetectable online guessing attacks to get the 
password of victim party. But in our scheme, such 
as EpWA(NAEBPWAEBt'SA) , EpWB(NBEBPWBEBt'SB) , EpWA ( 
PWAEBtAi) EpWB(PWBEBtBi) FS(rA) FSCrB) 
fKAS(NA) 
and fKBS(NB), we protect these messages that by 
using the PWA , PWB , NA , NB ,tAi ' tBi '  t'SA' t'SB' rA , rB 
and a trapdoor. Because the attacker does not know the victim's 
password and time-stamp, she or he wants to guess. But every 
client has her /him own password and time-stamp in server S. 
If the authentication doesn't successful, it will not return the 
session key parameters. Then, attackers cannot use a 
comparison to confirm the accuracy of the results. Thus, our 
proposed scheme can effectually protect the off-line password 
guessing attacks. 
3) Prevent to the on-line undetectable password guessing 
attacks 
For preventing the on-line undetectable password 
guessing attacks, we add the operations of both 
NAEBPWAEBt'SA 
and NBEBPWBEBt'SB into the equation 
as EpWA (NAEBPWAEBt'SA) , EpWB(NBEBPWBEBt'SB)' However, 
the password is shared between the server S and the 
corresponding user. When attackers want to guess the 
corresponding users password, they must let the authentication 
successful. Due to the corresponding password and time-stamp 
were only the server S and corresponding user knowing, such 
as PWA and t'SA correspond to client A and PWB and 
t'sBcorrespond to client B. Once the authentication doesn't 
meet the corresponding user, the server S doesn't return the 
session key parameters. Because of it, attackers cannot confirm 
the accuracy of guessing the password. Accordingly, our 
proposed scheme can resist the undetectable password guessing 
attacks. 
4) The time-stamps issues of 3PEKE scheme 
669 
In our scheme, the time-stamps need to analyze two 
aspects, the clients and server. For the clients, the time-stamps 
are be used to protect each client own password. Because each 
client generates a time-stamp in which the time-stamp is 
distinct from other clients'. If an attacker wants to guess the 
client's password, shelhe also needs to guess the time-stamp. 
But the time-stamp is different for each session. So an attacker 
simultaneously needs to guess password and time-stamps what 
it's very difficult. For the server, the time-stamp will be used to 
protect the client's password. And then, the password with 
time-stamp can be used to verify the legitimacy of client. Each 
password has its corresponding time-stamp in a session, and 
then both of passwords with time-stamp can be used to protect 
the corresponding client. 
2. Comparison results 
In this subsection, we compare the computation 
complexity, the ability of preventing the password guessing 
attacks as well as the on-line undetectable password guessing 
attacks, and the ability of time-stamps constraint upon the 
3PEKE protocol. The comparison results will be illustrated in 
Table 1. In traditional 3PEKE protocols [2, 3, 6, 26], the 
schemes should compute the number of transmission rounds 
(or steps) and computation complexity. Table 1 shows the 
performance comparison among related studies [2, 3, 6, 26] 
with our enhanced protocol. In Table 1, we show that our 
scheme has the same computational complexity compared with 
other schemes [2, 3, 6, 26] except the symmetric 
encryption/decryption. All schemes, in Table 1, support the 
function of mutual authentication. However, our scheme can 
effectively prevent the password guessing attacks as well as 
on-line undetectable password guessing attacks. Our scheme is 
more secure than other schemes. Besides, our scheme proposes 
the ability of time-stamps constraint. It will improve the 
security when the system suffers in the password guessing 
attacks.
