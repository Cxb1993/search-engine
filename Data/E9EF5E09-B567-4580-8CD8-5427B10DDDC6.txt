significant amount and hence removing nanoparticles by centrifugal force is possible. 
In addition, if the particle separator needs to be positioned in a straight section of a 
flow system, an axial flow cyclone may be used in which the tangential motion of the 
flow is induced by guiding vanes installed in line with the flow direction. 
 
2. OBJECTIVES 
This study intends to design an axial flow cyclone to remove fine and nano-size 
particles in the vacuum exhaust of the high-tech industries. It is expect to remove 
particles right at the downstream of the reaction chamber to avoid that particles clog 
the tube between the vacuum pump and local scrubber or pass through the central 
scrubber to pollute the air. 
Previous literatures on axial flow cyclone are not rich, such as the experimental 
work of Liu and Rubow (1984), Weiss et al. (1987) and Vaughan (1988), and 
theoretical work of Maynard (2000). So that it is meaningful to study the mechanism 
of axial flow cyclone for particle removal further. The theoretical equation of the 
cyclone cut-off aerodynamic will be studied in this study. In order to obtain a more 
accurate prediction of the collection efficiency and cutoff size of the cyclone, 3-D 
numerical simulation will be also conducted in this study to calculate the flow and 
pressure fields of the cyclone. The equation will be used to compare with existing data 
and also our own data. It is expected to develop a semi-empirical equation for 
designing the cyclone such as the one used in this study to control nanoparticles at 
reduced pressure. 
Brownian Dynamic Simulation for calculating particle trajectories with 
considering both centrifugal force and Brownian motion of particles will be also 
studied. If the simulated particle collection efficiency matches the experimental data, 
the numerical model can be use to find out a best geometry of the cyclone to increase 
the collection efficiency of nanoparticles. 
 
3. LETERATURE REVIEW 
A cyclone separator is a well-known dust separator or particle sampling device 
which is based on the particles experienced centrifugal force by vortex flow in the 
cyclone. There are two main designs: tangential and axial flow cyclones are the two 
main types. In a tangential flow cyclone, the flow enters tangentially in a cylinder 
creating a vortex inside. At the end of the outer vortex the flow is reversed and finally 
exits axially at the top. The flow in the tangential cyclone is usually highly turbulent 
and non-stationary, which together with the flow reversal in the cyclone result in a 
 4
flow cyclone operating in low pressure conditions remains to be investigated.   
The effect of deposited solid particles on the cyclone wall of the tangential flow 
cyclone has been investigated in Blachman and Lippmann (1974) and Tsai et al. 
(1999). The particle collection efficiency was found to increase with increasing 
particle mass deposited in the cyclone (Blachman and Lippmann, 1974). Such 
increase is mainly due to the accumulation of dust on the cyclone wall opposite to the 
inlet which gradually reduces the effective diameter of the cyclone. But when the 
amount of deposited particles is heavy enough, the aggregated particles will be 
detached and then the collection efficiency will reduce again (Blachman and 
Lippmann, 1974). The effect of different amounts of deposited particle mass on the 
collection efficiency was not studied in Blachman and Lippmann (1974). The solid 
particle loading effect on the collection efficiency for a 10 mm nylon cyclone and a 
new 18 mm aluminum cyclone was studied by Tsai et al. (1999). They found the 
cutoff aerodynamic diameter of both cyclones decreased with increasing deposited 
particle mass. But the 18 mm cyclone appeared to have less deposited particle mass 
effect on the collection efficiency due to its larger inner diameter. The cyclones tested 
in Blachman and Lippmann (1974) and Tsai et al. (1999) were tangential flow 
cyclones. There have been no studies on the solid particle loading effect on the 
collection efficiency for axial flow cyclones and it is expected that the axial flow 
cyclones will be less affected by the loaded particles on the cutoff diameter than 
impactors since the particle deposit in the cyclones is more diffuse. 
 Previous literatures on axial flow cyclone are not rich, such as the experimental 
work of Liu and Rubow (1984), Weiss et al. (1987) and Vaughan (1988), and 
theoretical work of Maynard (2000). These researches studied the axial flow cyclone 
operating at ambient condition. For example, an axial flow cascade cyclone at a 
design flow rate of 30 L/min was developed by Liu and Rubow (1984) for sampling 
high concentration of particles. The cutoff aerodynamic diameter of the five stages are 
12.2, 7.9, 3.6, 2.05 and 1.05 μm. Total particle loss in the system, including the loss in 
the body, vane insert and exit tube of the collection cup, was shown to be significant.  
It ranged from 15 % for particles of 1 μm in diameter to 33.3 % for particles of 8 μm 
in diameter. Therefore, using this cascade cyclone to measure particle size 
distributions requires complete recovery of all particles lost in the cyclone. 
Maynard (2000) is the first to study the particle penetration of the axial flow 
cyclone in ambient pressure theoretically. He derived the particle penetration of the 
axial flow cyclone based on the assumption that particle collection mainly occurs in 
the vane and body sections only.  The overall penetration, Pen, is combined from the 
penetrations derived separately for the vane and body sections as

and the diffusive cut-off aerodynamic diameter Dpa50,diff is  
 
 
                                                        (5) 
 
 
For the flow rate of 0.455 slpm and the pressure in the cyclone of several torrs, 
Eq. (3) predicts when particles are larger than 40 nm in aerodynamic diameter, 
centrifugal force is the predominant mechanism for particle removal while the 
diffusional deposition is the main mechanism for particles smaller than 40 nm in 
aerodynamic diameter. Below 40 nm, the collection efficiency of nanoparticles 
increases with decreasing particle size. Experimental data presented by Hsu et al. 
(2005) show similar trend but substantial disagreement exists between theoretical 
results and experimental data. 
In this study, OA monodisperse noaoparticles in diameter from 12 to 460 nm and 
NaCl monodisperse noaoparticles in diameter from 10 to 100 nm were generated to 
test the axial flow cyclones. The test conditions are: inlet pressure of 4.3 Torr at 0.351 
slpm, 5.4, 6.0, 8, 10 or 13 Torr at 0.455 slpm, and 6.8 or 7.0 Torr at 0.566 slpm, 13, 14, 
15, 16, 17 or 20 torr at 1 slpm. 
The 3-D numerical simulation was also conducted in this study to calculate the 
flow and pressure fields of the cyclone (vane design 1, one vane which makes 3 
complete turns which will be shown later) in order to obtain a more accurate 
prediction of the collection efficiency and cutoff size of the cyclone. A new empirical 
equation for predicting the cutoff aerodynamic diameter of the cyclone was also 
proposed based on the better knowledge of the 3-D flow and pressure fields obtained 
in this study. 
Finally, after the accurate flow and pressure fields were obtained, particle 
collection efficiencies were also calculated from the simulated results of particle 
trajectories. The efficiencies were validated by the experimental data obtained in this 
study, and those obtained by Hsu et al. (2005). In addition in the particle trajectory 
calculations, not only the centrifugal force, Brownian diffusion was also taken into

4.2 Numerical Particle Collection Efficiency 
4.2.1 Flow field calculation 
In order to obtain accurate pressure distribution and gas velocity fields in the 
cyclone, 3-D numerical simulation was conducted in the present study. The governing 
equations are Navier-Stokes and the continuity equations. Since the maximum 
Kundsen number in the present study for the pressure of 1.46 Torr (Pin=4.31 Torr) is 
around 0.01, the flow was considered as continuum. The maximum Kundsen number, 
Kn,max is calculated as

K λ2max, = ,                                      (13) 
where DO is the inner diameter of the outlet tube (m); λ is the mean free path of the air 
molecular (m). Moreover, Steady-state and compressible laminar flow was assumed in 
this study. The Navier-Stokes and the continuity equations were solved by using the 
STAR-CD 3.22 code (CD-adapco Japan Co., LTD) based on the finite volume 
discretization method.  The pressure-velocity linkage was solved by the SIMPLE 
(semi-implicit method for pressure linked equation) algorithm (Pantankar, 1980) and 
the differencing schemes for the space discretization method were the UD (upwind 
differencing) and CD (central differencing) schemes for the flow velocity and density,

greater than 5 mm (or rmax-rmin, the width of the vane section) then the particle hits the 
wall and is collected. Assuming different initial radial positions of a particle at the 
entry plane of the first segment, the critical curve which delineates the collection and 
non-collection regions of the particle can be found. As the collection area is obtained, 
then the collection efficiency can be calculated by the following equation as

where A is the collection area (mm2); 1,tV ′ is the average tangential velocity of the 
collection area (m/s); 5 (mm) and 4(mm) are the width and gap of the vane section, 
respectively (mm); 1,tV is the average tangential velocity at the entry plane of the 1st 
segment of the vane section. 
Since the pressure drop of the cyclone occurs mainly in the vane section, thnthV ,  
is calculated based on the pressure at the nth section following the ideal gas law and 
mass conservation principle. For comparison purpose, if the tangential flow field is 
assumed to be plug flow, the total radial migration distance Δr can be calculated as

time of the particle. Both thntV ,  and thnτ  depend on the average pressure at the n

4.3 Particle Trajectory Simulation for Collection Efficiency Calculation 
For the computation of collection efficiency, the Lagrangian method was used for 
calculating particle trajectories. For each particle diameter, particle trajectories of 
10,000 particles uniformly distributed in the inlet were calculated. When a particle 
touches the wall of the cyclone it was assumed to be collected by the cyclone. No 
bounce-back or re-suspension of previously deposited particles was taken into account.

                                                     (23) 
 
In the above equation, kB is Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. 
From Eq. (22), expected values of particle displacement in the i-th direction <ΔLi> 
and its velocity change <Δvi> during time interval Δt can be found as 
 
                                                          (24) 
 
                                                           (25) 
 
The standard deviations of displacement σLi and particle velocity change σvi has been 
derived to be 
 
                                                             (26) 
                                                              (27) 
 
In this study extension of BD for the case of moving fluid with external forces 
derived by Podgórski (2002) was used. Integration of Langevin equation for the time 
interval small enough that the host fluid velocity u and external forces F(ext) may be 
assumed constant over (t, t+Δt), gives the following bivariate normal density 
probability distribution function ϑi(Δvi, ΔLi) 
 
 
                                                            (28) 
 
 
 
where ρc is the coefficient of correlation. 
The distribution may be rearranged to a more convenient form as the product of 
two Gaussian distributions:

4.4 Experimental 
The experimental system is shown in Fig. 1.  Monodisperse OA (ρp= 894 kg/m3) 
particles in diameter between 12 and 460 nm and monodisperse NaCl (ρp= 2200 
kg/m3) in diameter between 10 and 100 nm were generated by the atomization and 
electrostatic classification technique. Polydisperse particles were first generated by 
atomizing (Atomizer, TSI Model 3076) 0.05 or 0.1% (v/v) OA and NaCl solution.  
Then the aerosol flow was dried by a silica gel drier. To obtain sub-micron OA 
particles (100-460 nm), the dried aerosol stream was classified by the TSI model 3071 
long DMA. On the other hand, for producing nanoparticles, the dried aerosol stream 
was passed through a furnace (Lindberg/Blue Model CC58114C-1) to evaporate 
particles. The temperature of the furnace was fixed at 650 and 1150 K for OA and 
NaCl particles, respectively. By mixing the vapor with dry compressed air, 
monodisperse, singly charged particles were generated by classifying the polydisperse 
particles by a nano-DMA (TSI Model 3085).

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
5.1 Comparison of particle Collection Efficiency between Two Different Vanes 
The experimental particle collection efficiency curves of OA particles are shown 
in Fig. 4(a) to (d) for two flow rates and two vane designs. In general, a higher 
vacuum pressure results in a higher particle collection efficiency, and design 1 has 
higher collection efficiency than design 2. For design 1, at the flow rate of 0.455 slpm 
and the inlet pressure of 6 torr, the collection efficiency increases from 32 % to nearly 
100 %, as the particle diameter of oleic acid is increased from 35 to 100 nm (Fig. 4(a)). 
The cutoff diameter is 48.7 μm. As the inlet pressure is increased from 6 to 8, 10 or 13 
Torr, the collection efficiency drops considerably and the curves look less like 
S-shaped. The cutoff diameter is increased to 153.4 and 330 nm for the inlet pressure 
 18
411 nm for design 1, and from 145.5 to 600 nm for design 2. 
 
5.2 Comparison of Collection Efficiency between Liquid and Solid Particles 
The collection efficiencies of solid NaCl and liquid OA particles for the inlet 
pressure of 6 and 5.4 Torr and the sampling flow rate of 0.455 slpm are compared in 
Fig. 5. For OA particles, the present experimental data are in good agreement with 
Tsai et al. (2004). The collection efficiencies are seen to be greatly improved for both 
OA and NaCl particles when the pressures at the cyclone inlet are reduced from 6 to 
5.4 Torr. The cutoff aerodynamic diameters of OA and NaCl particles are reduced 
from 49.8 and 47.1 to 23.1 and 21.2 nm, respectively as the pressure at the cyclone 
inlet is decreased from 6 to 5.4 Torr, respectively. In addition, Fig. 4 indicates that the

collection efficiencies of liquid and solid particles are close to each other for both 
operation pressures except in the size range from 60 to 120 nm at 6 Torr where the 
collection efficiency of OA is slightly better (within 10%) than NaCl. This is to say 
that the effect of solid particle bounce on the collection efficiency is not very obvious. 
Furthermore, it also found the diffusion effect on collection efficiency for 
particles less than (40 nm) is not as significant as claimed by Hsu et al. (2005).

and a more uniform particle deposit on the cyclone wall. As a result, the solid particle 
loading effect on the collection efficiency is not as significant as that of the small 
tangential flow cyclone.

where ρ , aV  are the gas density (kg/m3) and the average axial velocity (m/s), 
respectively. ρ , aV , and μ  were evaluated at the entry of the vane section. The figure 
shows that the parameter A, which is defined as A=Pin¯Pout/Qo (Pin: pressure at the 
cyclone inlet; Pout: pressure at the vane outlet), influences the collection efficiency and 
cutoff diameter. The larger A is the smaller collection efficiency the cyclone becomes. 
The cutoff size is 21.7, 23.1, 25.6 nm for the inlet pressure of 4.3 Torr at 0.351 slpm

of the experimental data) in the first turn and then drops monotonically in the second 
and third turns. Finally, the pressure remains nearly constant at 260 Pa (1.95 Torr) 
after the end of the third turn. That is, the pressure drop occurs almost entirely in the 
second and third turns. The figure shows that the flow does not make 3 full turns as 
the vane does. Rather, it makes slightly more than two turns only. This is one of the 
main reasons why the differences are large between the experimental cutoff 
aerodynamic diameters and the previous theoretical values in which the tangential 
flow was assumed to make three full turns and the tangential velocity was assumed to 
be plug flow.   
Figs. 9 (a) and (b) show the tangential velocity profile at the vertical cut planes 
at the end of 2 and 3 turns, respectively. The tangential velocity peaks near the center

error in the numerical prediction of the cutoff aerodynamic diameter by the paraboloid 
flow assumption is 5.9, 0.7, and 1.5 %, for Pin = 4.3, 5.4, and 6.8 Torr, respectively. In

over-estimates while the paraboloid flow assumption under-estimates the collection 
efficiencies when the particle diameter is greater than the cutoff aerodynamic diameter.  
The maximum difference for the paraboloid flow assumption is around 12 %, which is 
slightly better than the plug flow assumption of 15%.   
In Fig. 11 (b), it is seen larger differences occur between the experimental data

values are smaller than the experimental results. Therefore, an empirical factor K, 
which is defined as the ratio of the experimental cutoff size to the theoretical value, is 
suggested to adjust the theoretical cutoff size. In Table 1, K is shown to be relatively

is, the semi-empirical cutoff aerodynamic diameter can be rewritten as

It is observed in Fig. 12 that all experimental data of particle collection efficiency 
almost fall on a unique curve, which can be fitted by the following Boltzmann

Substituting Eq. (39) into Eq. (44), *50St  is found to be a fixed value of 0.241.  
The experimental collection efficiency versus St  (calculated from Eq. (42)) for all 
five test conditions was plotted (not shown here), and the experimental 50St  was 
calculated to be 0.256, 0.240, 0.222, 0.226 and 0.240 for Pin = 4.3, 5.4, 6.8, 7.0 and 
6.0 Torr, respectively.  The difference between the experimental 50St  and the 
semi-empirical *50St , or 0.241, is -6.2, 0.4, 7.9, 1.5 and 0.4 % for Pin = 4.3, 5.4, 6.8, 
7.0 and 6.0 Torr, respectively.  That is, for the present axial flow cyclone for 
removing nanoparticles, the design value for the square root of the cutoff Stokes 
number is

greater than the cut-off size, the centrifugal force dominates and whether or not 
Brownian motion is considered does not make difference in the collection efficiency 
curves. For the cut-off diameter, simulation considering Brownian diffusion results in 
smaller and more accurate results than the case without considering Brownian

when Pin=6 and 7 torr. Also shown in Table 1, the cut-off diameter is 36.98 and 50.03

1.5 turns, respectively. The diffusional deposition is small in the vane section of the 
cyclone as the flow residence time is usually small (on the order of 0.003 sec) for the 
cyclone operating in vacuum conditions. In addition to the vane section, the 
theoretical prediction of particle deposition in the chamber of the vane is difficult due 
to the complexity of the flow field in it. The only way to calculate the collection 
efficiency of nanoparticles accurately is by the numerical flow and particle simulation, 
such as the Brownian Dynamics simulation in this study.
