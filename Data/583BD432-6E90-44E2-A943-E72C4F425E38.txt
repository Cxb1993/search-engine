中文摘要  
本報告探討一個自動建構客戶保留策略之智慧型系統。以行動通信業做為研究對象，本系統
首先利用決策樹技術分析客戶往來記錄資料庫以習得客戶流失率預測模型，並將此模型最佳
化。接著本系統建構出ㄧ個保留策略模型，將保留策略知識本體中適當的保留策略基元，對
應到特定的客戶流失關聯屬性值群組。系統可在鑑別出潛在流失客戶的客戶價值後，透過該
模型來自動提出適當的保留策略以嘗試留住具有高客戶價值的客戶。前述保留策略知識本體
係廣泛收集與分析業界及學術界之相關客戶保留策略所建構而成。我們的實驗結果顯示，客
戶流失率預測模型經十等份交互驗證，可以達到近百分之八十五的正確度。此外，與某ㄧ電
信業者網佔所提供之費率方案估算系統做初步比較，本系統自動建議潛在流失客戶的費率方

Abstract 
This report describes the results of our last-year project in developing an intelligent system for han-
dling the customer retention task. Taking wireless telecommunication industry as a target of re-
search, our system first learns an optimized churn predictive model from a historical services data-
base by the decision tree-based technique to support the prediction of defection probability of cus-
tomers. We then construct a retention policy model, which maps clusters of churn attributes to re-
tention policy primitives structured in a retention policy ontology. The retention policy model sup-
ports automatic proposing of suitable retention policies to retain a possible churner provided that he 
or she is a valuable subscriber. The retention policy ontology was constructed by surveying on a 
variety of policies about customer retention in lots of industries and academic papers. Our experi-
ment shows the learned churn predictive model has around 85% of correctness in tenfold 
cross-validation. And a preliminary test on proposing suitable package plans shows the retention 
policy model works equally well as a commercial website.

1. Introduction 
To build customer loyalty and maximize profitability, intelligent techniques for predicting customer 
churning behaviours are becoming more than necessary in customer relationship management

We used Protégé 3.0, which was developed by University of Stanford [9], to build this ontology.

2.2 Historical Services Database 
The historical customer services database of a major telecommunication company in Taiwan is used 
as our example database. It span for six months and contained information about 63,367 subscribers, 
each described by hundreds of attributes. Among the attributes, we identify 13 attributes, which we 
think are most significant in our work. We enumerate the value range of each attribute as shown in 
Table 1. The following represents an example subscriber data: 
Subscriber A: ‘15’, ‘8’, ‘3’, ‘2’, ‘4’, ‘7’, ‘1’, ‘3’, ‘0’, ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘2’. 
Note that some attributes in our database are numerical, including Tenure, Average invoice, and 
Average domestic invoice. They can not be directly used by the decision tree algorithm. We need to 
divide the range of each such numerical attribute into several intervals whose boundaries are deter-
mined according to the subscriber distribution: a cut point is chosen and a boundary is created when 
the slope of the subscriber distribution curve makes an apparent change.

3.2 Churn Attribute Cluster Constructor 
Designing suitable retention policies for possible churners is not an easy task for humans. To do it 
automatically is even harder. One naïve idea is to provide possible churners with policies according 
to each single attribute value. It, however, may miss hidden, but significant interactions among at-
tribute values, which can play a key role in explaining why subscribers defect. Our first task is thus 
to discover how attributes are associated with one another by the association rule mining technique. 
From the historical services database of all churners, we use Apriori algorithm [13] to mine the as-
sociation rules, which are in the form of: 
Tenure=0  Average invoice=2  2480 ==> Package code=4  2363  conf: (0.95). 
This sample rule means that there are 2,480 churners whose Tenure is 0~4 months (code 0) 
and Average invoice is 201~500 NT dollars (code 2), and among whom 2,363 churn because the 
Package code is 4. The confidence of this rule is 0.95. In our experiment, we discovered 12 associa-
tion rules with the minimum support set to 0.1 and confidence to 0.8. All of the attributes involved 
in a single rule have to be considered at the same time during the decision of suitable retention poli-
cies. In other words, we need to group the antecedents and consequents of a rule into a cluster, and 
define for it one or several retention policies accordingly. Fig. 4 shows the constructed churn attrib-
ute clusters corresponding to these rules. Note that some rules, like Rules 7 and 11, fall into the 
same group because they contain the same attributes after combination. In the figure some clusters 
are isolated while others are related by the “isa” relationship and form a class hierarchy.  
The complete churn attribute cluster model was similarly constructed from 300 association 
rules, with support from 0.1 down to 0.01 and fixed confidence = 0.8, as partially shown in Fig. 5. 
This hierarchical model allows us to easily set corresponding policies for two groups that are related 
by “isa”. Note that each cluster in the figure is marked with a support value, which is used for con-
flict resolution. The support values are created by the association rule mining. Specifically, we 
executed Apriori algorithm ten times starting from support = 0.1 down to support = 0.01 with 0.01 
decrement each time. A less minimum support usually generates a greater number of large itemsets, 
which in turns causes more rules to be created. By comparing the current set of rules with those 
generated last time, we can associate the newly generated rules with the current minimum support 
value. This support-value-based distinction between the rules allows us to solve any possible con-
flicts between two or more clusters of policies by preferring rules with higher supports during con-
flict resolution.

Table 2. Construction of the retention policy model  
Cluster Explanation Proposed retention policies 
Cluster 1  
Tenure=0, Package code=4 
The duration of use is less than 4 months, 
and the package plan is Base Rate, which is a 
normal plan. So we recommend two policies. 
-Provide all kinds of discountable 
tickets regularly. 
-Announce the newest discountable 
plans regularly. 
Cluster 2  
Zip code=15, Tenure=0,  
Package code=4 
This cluster looks similar to Cluster 1 except 
Zip code shows people living in Kaohsiung 
city tend to churn. We conjecture that the 
condition might happen because of the effi-
ciency of trouble solving. So we add a new 
policy. 
-Solve the troubles reported by the 
subscribers immediately and report 
to them as soon as the troubles are 
cleared. 
-Provide all kinds of discountable 
tickets regularly. 
-Announce the newest discountable 
plans regularly. 
Cluster 3  
Tenure=0, Average domestic 
invoice=0, Package code=4 
The association between Average domestic 
invoice=0 and Package code=4 reveals no 
new information. So we still recommend 
policies according to the value of Tenure. 
-Provide all kinds of discountable 
tickets regularly. 
-Announce the newest discountable 
plans regularly. 
Cluster 4  
Tenure=0, Average invoice=2, 
Package code=4 
In this cluster, Average invoice (code=2) is 
higher than Package plan (code=4). We thus 
add a new policy of changing package plans. 
-Change package plan to “Base Rate 
Plus 100”. 
-Provide all kinds of discountable 
tickets regularly. 
-Announce the newest discountable 
plans regularly. 
Cluster 5  
Service center=5, Tenure=0,  
Package code=4, Average do-
mestic invoice=0 
This cluster is the superclass of Cluster 3 
with one more attribute value: Service cen-
ter=5. It implies that some services might be 
unsatisfactory in service center 5. As a result, 
we add a new policy. 
-Enhance the ability of prob-
lem-solving of the engineers. 
-Provide all kinds of discountable 
tickets regularly. 
-Announce the newest discountable 
plans regularly. 
Cluster 6  
Service center=5, Tenure=0,  
Gender=1, Package code=4 
This cluster is the superclass of Cluster 1 
with two more attribute values: Service cen-
ter=5 and Gender=1. Unfortunately, it seems 
that no new information can be discovered 
from these two attribute values. So we rec-
ommend the same policies as for Cluster 1. 
-Provide all kinds of discountable 
tickets regularly. 
-Announce the newest discountable 
plans regularly. 
Cluster 7 
Tenure=0, Gender=1, Average 
invoice=2, Package code=4 
This cluster is the superclass of Cluster 4 
along with one more attribute value: Gen-
der=1, which provides no specific informa-
tion for policy making. We thus recommend 
the same policies as for Cluster 4. 
-Change package plan to “Base Rate 
Plus 100”. 
-Provide all kinds of discountable 
tickets regularly. 
-Announce the newest discountable 
plans regularly. 
Cluster 8  
Tenure=0, Average invoice=2, 
Average domestic invoice=0, 
Package code=4 
This cluster is the superclass of Cluster 4 
with one more attribute: Average domestic 
invoice=0. Taking the values of Average in-
voice and Average domestic invoice into ac-
count, the ratio of the average monthly do-
mestic fees to the average monthly fees is 
lower than 50 percent. We thus add a new 
-Select an appropriate message 
package plan to suit personal usage. 
-Provide all kinds of discountable 
tickets regularly. 
-Announce the newest discountable 
plans regularly.

As for the evaluation of policy proposing, we found some telecommunication company pro-
vides a website to help the subscribers calculate which package plans fit them best [8] and it can be 
used to partially evaluate how well the automatic policy proposing mechanism in our system does. 
The input data of the website include: the total call minutes per month, the intra-carrier-call minutes 
per month, the cross-carrier-call minutes per month. 
After normalizing the definition of each package plan of the website to make it the same as 
ours, we randomly selected 10 churner instances from the historical services database for evaluation. 
The attribute values of the 10 instances are shown in Table 4. The results of the package plans pro-
posed by the website and our system are shown in Table 5. It shows only case 9 results in different 
package plans. This divergence is because of the bad correspondence between the package plan se-
lected by customer 9 and his calling minutes. Note that package code 0 stands for the “standard” 
payment package which has a fixed high monthly rental fee, from which the calling charge is not 
deductible, even though its per-minute calling charge is low. It is suitable to high-volume traffic 
customers. In that case, no divergence will happen and our system works as well, e.g., cases 1, 7, 
and 8. A low-volume traffic user, e.g., case 9, however, will end up with a very high average in-
voice and causes divergence. This divergence cannot be tackled by our system for now, because the 
Policy Proposer currently only considers deductible package plans.

6 Conclusions and Discussion 
This report describes the results of our last year project in developing an intelligent customer reten-
tion system, which works in two modes. In the learning mode, it learns about potential associations 
inside the historical services database to construct a churn predictive model. It also creates a churn 
attribute cluster model by exploiting the co-relationships among the attribute values of all churners 
in the historical services database. The churn attribute cluster model, with the support of the reten-
tion policy ontology which consists of comprehensive retention policy primitives, allows us to cre-
ate a retention policy model that maps appropriate retention policies to the clusters. In the applica-
tion mode, it uses the churn predictive model to calculate the churn probability of a given subscriber. 
If the subscriber is decided to be a potential churner, it goes one further step to evaluate whether he 
is valuable to retain. A valuable churner will invoke the system to propose proper retention policies 
according to the retention policy model. Our experimental results show that the churn predictive 
model, containing only ten attributes, can reach a high degree of prediction accuracy. A preliminary 
test on proposing package plans also shows the system works equally well as a commercial website. 
The attributes we used to construct the churn predictive model in our system contain much in-
