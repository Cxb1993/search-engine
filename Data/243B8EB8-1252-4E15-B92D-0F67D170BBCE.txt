中文摘要 
目前，覆晶（flip-chip）封裝技術已經成為高階電子元件封裝的最佳選擇。
由於銲點的尺寸變小，屆時通過銲點的電流密度(current density)可能高達 104 
A/cm2 以上。在此電流密度下，電遷移(electromigration)效應對銲點可靠度之影響
將變的相當重要。在目前發表的失效機制中，皆是在銲點晶片端之電子流入口
處，電遷移導致的孔洞（void）迅速生成，對銲點可靠度造成影響。事實上，此
區域除了銲料外還包含了一相當薄的 UBM（under bump metallization）層，在銲
點的可靠度中亦扮演相當重要的角色。本研究目的即在探討電遷移效應對 UBM
消耗及銲點失效機制兩者間的相互影響。實驗結果發現，晶片端靠近電子流入口
端處，局部 Ni UBM 被加速消耗。當局部的 Ni UBM 被消耗殆盡後，接著一多孔
狀結構在原來 Ni UBM 位置形成，因此電子流無法繼續通過此處。本實驗也發現
電遷移所導致的孔洞與多孔狀結構形成為兩個互相競爭的機制。如果多孔狀結構
先形成，那麼孔洞就無法在此處聚集生成。

內部微結構。圖 2（a），經過 700 小時通電，銲點內部鉛相（呈白色）明顯的朝
基板端移動，顯示鉛相在溫度超過 120℃下移動較錫相（呈暗黑色）快速[28]，
此時仍沒有孔洞在銲點中生成。經過 1700 小時通電，孔洞明顯形成於銲點之晶
片端中間，如圖 2（b）所示。一般而言電子流流入銲點的入口處會有最高的電
流密度及最高程度的 current crowding，所以孔洞最易在此處生成。值得注意的
一點，圖 2（b）中在銲點的右上角，亦即電子流流入銲點的入口處，孔洞並未
在此處生成。當通電時間達 2700 小時，銲點內的孔洞已發展的相當大，如圖 2
（c）所示。而通電至 3000 小時，銲點已經失效，如圖 2（d）。圖 2（d）中銲點
內部微結構明顯的由鉛錫分相轉變為鉛錫共晶結構，可見銲點發生了重熔
（re-melting）過程。明顯的，由於重熔過程導致最後銲點的失效。 
 
2.Ni UBM 消耗、多孔結構與孔洞生成 
圖 3 為圖 2（a）之 150℃下通電 700 小時後銲點內部之微結構放大圖。如圖
2（a）所示，此時孔洞仍未在電子流流入銲點的入口處生成。而圖 3（b）中可
以明顯的發現經過 700 小時通電，在最右上角處的 Ni UBM 已經被完全耗盡，銲
點內的破裂處則是在試片製備時產生。在圖 3（c）中，右邊靠近電子流入口處
之 Ni UBM 已經耗盡，而左邊的部份 Ni UBM 仍存在。由圖 3（d）則明顯的發
現原來的 Ni UBM 被多孔狀的結構所取代。圖 4（a）為多孔結構的放大圖，而
圖 4（b）則是未通電前的 Ni UBM 結構。由圖 4 可知 Ni 原子藉由 out-diffusion
進入介金屬造成 Ni UBM 的消耗。 
因此，在通電的初期，主要的微結構變化是電子流入口處的 Ni UBM 耗盡（圖
3（b））。通電達 1700 小時（圖 2（b）），孔洞在銲點之晶片端中心形成。圖 5 為
圖 2（b）之孔洞左方的放大圖。由圖 5 可知此時孔洞上方的 Ni UBM 仍完整的
存在。這也顯示為了讓孔洞可以繼續往左方發展，上方的 Ni UBM 要完整存在，
讓電子流可以繼續流入。 
 
五、討論 
1.current crowding 與局部 Joule heating 兩者扮演之角色 
根據文獻指出，current crowding 效應會導致銲點內部的孔洞生成與發展，
造成銲點壽命縮短[25]。然而，本實驗中，在通電的初期，current crowding 效應
導致非對稱的 Ni UBM 消耗。如圖 3（b），銲點最右上角處的 Ni UBM 已經被耗
盡。而圖 3（c）所示的銲點左上方，部分的 Ni UBM 仍然存在。 
當 Ni UBM 被耗盡後，圖 4（a）中的多孔結構形成於原本的 Ni UBM 的位
置。此外，此一多孔結構最先形成於銲點的右上方處，也是最初 current crowding
最嚴重，電流密度也最高的位置。因此，我們認為此一結構的形成是由於此一區
域的高電流密度加速了 Ni 原子的 out-diffusion 所造成的。 
事實上，current crowding 效應表示銲點局部區域有較大的電流密度，此時
產生的局部 Joule heating 則變得相當重要。靠近電子流流入銲點的入口，亦即局

a conﬁguration illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.
The chips had Al interconnect lines, which were
60 mm wide and 1 mm thick. The UBM on the chips
had the Cu/Ni/Al structure. The Cu and the Ni layers
were sputter-deposited and were 0.8 mm and 0.5 mm
thick, respectively. The diameter of the contact
window was 90 mm. On the substrate side, the
metal that is in direct contact with solder was
30-mm-thick Cu. The solder was 63Sn37Pb eutectic
solder, and the solder joints had a nominal diame-
ter of 125 mm.
During electromigration test, the assembled chips
and substrates were kept in a oven set at 150°C. A
constant 0.32-A current was passed through the
solder joints, producing a nominal current density
of 5 3 103 A/cm2 (based on the opening area of the
contact window). In order to study the UBM con-
sumption and the void formation, the solder joints
were cross-sectioned after current stresses at
different periods of time and examined using a
scanning electron microscope (SEM). The compo-
sitions of the intermetallic compounds were
determined by the electron probe microanalysis
(EPMA).
Certain samples were cross-sectioned in half before
current stressing in order to observe the micro-
structural change in-situ during electromigration.
Current stressing for these in-situ samples was car-
ried out at room temperature (30°C). A constant
0.96-A current was passed through the solder joints,
producing a nominal current density of 3 3 104 A/cm2
(based on the opening area of the contact window
after sectioning). During current stressing, thermal
couples were attached to the chip and to the BT
substrate to monitor the temperature. The surface
microstructure changes were monitored with a SEM.
In order to perform observations, we had to stop the
current stressing and place the specimen under the
microscope. After the observation, current stressing
was resumed using the same specimen. In other
words, the current stressing was interrupted sev-
eral times.
RESULTS
Room Temperature in-Situ Observation
Figure 2a and b shows the microstructures near
the entrance of the electrons into the solder joint
before current stressing and after current stressing
for 2 h, respectively. These two micrographs show
the same area of the same solder joint. As shown in
Fig. 2a, the 0.8-mm Cu of the UBM had been con-
sumed completely during the assembly. The EPMA
analysis revealed that the phase above the solder
was Cu6Sn5. The Ni layer was still intact after
assembly. Inside the solder, the Pb-rich phase was
the bright phase, while the Sn-rich phase was the
darker phase. In Fig. 2b, the electrons entered the
joint from the upper-left corner. After current
stressing for 2 h, it can be seen by comparing Fig.
2a and b that the circled Pb-rich phase had shrunk
in size, which implied that more Pb had been driven
away by electromigration. At the same time, the
Sn-rich phase inside the circle had grown in size,

Electromigration-Induced UBM Consumption and the
Resulting Failure Mechanisms in Flip-Chip Solder Joints 1011
DISCUSSION
Intermetallic Formation
In this study, the intermetallic compound formed
between solder and Ni was always Cu6Sn5. The
compound Ni3Sn4 did not form between the solder
and Ni because Ni3Sn4 is not in thermodynamic
equilibrium with the solder when the Cu concentra-
tion in solder is higher than about 0.5 wt.%.18–23
There was plenty of Cu in the solder joints used in
this study. The ﬁrst source was the thin Cu layer
originally over the Ni UBM, and the second source
was the thick Cu layer from the substrate side.
Role of the Current Crowding
It had been reported that current crowding could
shorten the lifetime of devices through the void for-
mation-and-propagation mechanism.17 In the joints
used in this study, it was found that in the early
stage the main effect of current crowding was the
accelerating local Ni consumption. In Fig. 5b, which
shows region near the far right, the Ni UBM had
been consumed completely. In Fig. 5c, which shows
region to the left of Fig. 5a, part of the Ni UBM still
existed.
The porous structure in Fig. 6a formed at the
original location of the Ni UBM after Ni had been
exhausted. Moreover, this porous structure occurred
only near the far right of the contact window, where
the current crowding was initially the highest. We
propose that this structure formed due to the rapid
out-diffusion of Ni driven by the local high current
density.
Role of the Local Joule Heating
Local Joule heating was another important factor
that contributed to Ni consumption during electro-
migration. As the current density distribution in the
solder joint was not uniform, the local Joule heating
was also not uniform. The results of the in-situ
experiments indeed showed that the temperature
near the electron entrance to the joint, where the
local current density was the highest, was higher
than the rest of the joint. This higher local temperature

Electromigration-Induced UBM Consumption and the
Resulting Failure Mechanisms in Flip-Chip Solder Joints 1013
made the local Ni consumption rate higher, as a
high temperature accelerates both the reaction rate
and the diffusion rate.
Interplay Between Ni Consumption and the
Void Formation-and-Propagation
As shown in Fig. 4b and c, the void initiated near
the middle of the cathode side and propagated to the
left. Interestingly, the void did not form at the far-
right corner. We also note that a porous structure
occurs at the contact area between IMC and Al line
near the electron entrance, as shown in Fig. 5. We
propose that the formation of the porous structure
somehow inhibited the formation of the void. The
porous structure might in fact be electrically non-
conductive, and electrons were diverted to the left
once the porous structure formed. Consequently,
the void could not nucleate in the solder below the
porous structure, as the porous structure had blocked
the ﬂow of the electrons through that region.
It was reported that void formation due to electro-
migration needed an incubation time for the accu-
mulation of vacancies.3,15 However, this study
shows that if, during the incubation time, the Ni
UBM is completely consumed at a certain place,
the electrons would then be blocked there and the
void would not be able to nucleate there. Because
the Ni UBM consumption rate would be the highest
near the corner where the electrons entered the
joint due to the combined effect of higher local cur-
rent density and higher local temperature, the
Ni UBM would be completely consumed near that
corner. Consequently, the void would not be able to
form ﬁrst near the corner of the joint.
A schematic drawing is shown in Fig. 8 to illus-
trate the sequence of events. As shown in Fig. 8a,
the Cu layer on the UBM has been completely con-
sumed, and the intermetallic was in direct contact
with the Ni layer of the UBM after assembly. The Ni
UBM at the upper-right corner was consumed quickly
to form the porous structure due to the higher local
temperature and the higher local current density
there as shown in Fig. 8b. When the porous struc-
ture formed, the electrons were diverted to the left.
This decreased the overall cross-section area of the
joint, and the average current density increased. A
higher average current density made the incubation
time for vacancy nucleation decrease, and a void was
able to nucleate next to the porous structure before
the Ni UBM immediately above the void could be
consumed completely. Once the void formed, the
void propagated to the left and eventually the joint
failed, as shown in Fig. 8c. In short, the formation of
the void and the formation of the porous structure
were competing with each other. If the porous struc-
ture formed ﬁrst, then the void would not be able to
nucleate there. On the other hand, if the void could
nucleate before the UBM above lost its conductivity,
then the joint would fail by the void formation-and-
propagation mechanism.
CONCLUSION
It was found that the Ni UBM consumption
played an important role on the eventual failure
mechanism. At the corner of a joint where the elec-
trons entered the joint, higher local current density
and higher local temperature accelerated the local
Ni UBM consumption. Once the Ni was completely
consumed at a certain place, the electron ﬂow was
locally blocked, and the electrons were diverted else-
where. The void would then not be able to nucleate
in the solder below. However, if the void could nucleate

ﬁgure shows that the void could continue to propagate to the left as
long as the Ni UBM had not been exhausted.

This investigation studies how electron ﬂow distribution and the vacancy
concentration gradient affect the diffusion of solder atoms in a ﬂip-chip solder
joint under current stress. The migration of materials was traced by monitor-
ing the positions of 21 Pb grains of the eutectic PbSn solder joint. Experimen-
tal results indicate that the displacements of the Pb grains were not uniform
along the electron ﬂow direction. Additionally, certain Pb grains exhibited
lateral displacements. The nonuniform material migration is attributable to
the combined effect of electromigration and the vacancy concentration gra-
dient, which was caused by electromigration. By measuring the displacements
of the Pb grains, we estimated that the DZ* value of Sn in eutectic SnPb solder
was 5 3 1010 cm2/s.
Key words: Electromigration, ﬂip-chip, PbSn solder
INTRODUCTION
Electromigration has long been known to cause
failures in the interconnect lines of electronic devi-
ces, and recently electromigration has also become
one of the major reliability concerns for ﬂip-chip
solder joints.1–5 The electromigration problem in
ﬂip-chip joints is rather difﬁcult to solve due to the
complicated geometry of the solder joint. At the
electron entrance to the solder joint, the path of
electrons goes through a 90° turn and the cross-
sectional area for electron ﬂow increases by a factor
of 100. This change in both electron ﬂow direction
and the cross-sectional area makes current crowding
very pronounced.6–8 Furthermore, near the electron
entrance, where the local current density is high
and the current crowding effect is strong, the local
temperature is also high due to a Joule heating
effect. The combined effect of high local current den-
sity, strong current crowding, and high local tem-
perature causes the rate of material migration at
this location (hereinafter, the current crowding
region) to be the highest throughout the solder joint.
Our previous study on electromigration in eutec-
tic SnPb solder joints at a mean current density of
3.1 3 104 A/cm2 (at the contact window) indicated
that the measured temperature near the current-
crowding region increased from room temperature
to 108°C by Joule heating.9 Such a temperature
is 83% of the eutectic PbSn temperature, and the
lattice diffusion became the dominant mechanism
of diffusion of Pb and Sn in the PbSn substrate. In
the present investigation, the temperature and the
current density were the same as those adopted in
an earlier work.9 Therefore, the dominant mecha-
nism of atom migration is the vacancy diffusion
through the lattice. Because both Pb and Sn diffuse
in solders by the vacancy diffusion mechanism, a
vacancy ﬂux is established, in the opposite direction
of the material migration ﬂux.
This study examines how electron ﬂow distribu-
tion and the vacancy concentration gradient affect
the diffusion of solder atoms in a ﬂip-chip solder
joint under current stress. An in-situ observation
is also made of the migration of materials caused
by the diffusion of Pb and Sn of the ﬂip-chip solder
joints under current stress at room temperature.
The migration of materials is traced by monitoring
the positions of the easily observable Pb grains of
the eutectic PbSn solder. In order to correlate the
material migration with the electron current distri-
bution, the electron current distribution was calcu-
lated using the ﬁnite-element approach.
EXPERIMENT
Figure 1a schematically depicts the samples used
for in-situ electromigration testing. The solder was
eutectic PbSn, and the solder joint had a normal
diameter of 125 mm. The under-bump metallurgy(Received March 1, 2006; accepted April 28, 2006)

that the circled Pb grain had moved upward under
current stressing. Since the electrons ﬂowed down-
ward from the chip side to the substrate side, in this
particular case, the Pb grain was concluded to have
moved in a direction opposite that of the electron
ﬂow. Since electromigration drives diffusion in the
same direction, the upward movement of this Pb
grain must be caused by the downward diffusion
of the Sn atoms in the Sn-rich matrix. Brieﬂy, Sn
was concluded to be the dominant diffuser under
current stress in this study. This result was reason-
able because the solder temperature was about
108°C during current stressing and Sn had been
reported to be the dominant diffusing species at
temperatures below 120°C.12
The circled Pb grain in Fig. 3 not only moved
upward, but also rotated counterclockwise during
current stressing, as indicated by the arrow in Fig.
3a–d. High-resistance Sn grains have been reported
to rotate to reorient themselves with respect to the
neighboring low-resistance grains for in-current
stressing experiments on the Sn stripe.13 However,
at this stage, whether the observed rotation of the
Pb grain herein is caused in this way is unclear.
Analysis of Motion of Pb Grains
The positions of 21 Pb grains were monitored
during current stressing, as shown in Fig. 4a, to
analyze the diffusion behavior of Sn and Pb under
current stressing. The unreacted Cu conducting
trace at the lower left-hand corner was taken as
the ﬁxed frame of reference. The positions (x and y
coordinates) of these 21 Pb grains during current
stressing were recorded and plotted in Fig. 4b. All
of these 21 Pb grains moved upward with current
stress, revealing that Sn was pushed downward by
electromigration throughout the entire joint.
In Fig. 4c, the solder joints were divided into three
regions according to the distance migrated in the
vertical direction after 1,000 min of stressing. The
displacement was 2–3 mm in the vertical direction in
region A, 5–6 mm in region B, and 8–10 mm in region
C. In the central region C, much of the material had
migrated, indicating that most of the electrons
passed through C. In region B, the migration was
less substantial, and in region A, the migration was
the smallest, indicating that fewer electrons passed
through regions A and B than passed through
region C. In short, the experimental results demon-
strated that the distribution of the current ﬂow was
very inhomogeneous in the solder bump.

the region of high current density, the Sn atoms
were driven downward by electromigration. As the
Sn atoms diffused away, a vacancy ﬂux diffused in
the opposite direction, reaching the region near
the interface between Cu and the solder. Therefore,
the concentration of vacancies increased. In order
to decrease the vacancy concentration here, the va-
cancy diffused to the right, and consequently an
opposite Sn ﬂux diffused to the left. This Sn diffu-
sion ﬂux to the left was responsible for the disap-
pearance of the Sn-rich region.
The current density simulation yields information
on the electron ﬂow direction and the density at
every location. Figure 7a shows the information at
selected locations. Based on the assumption that the
migration of Pb grains presented in Fig. 4b can be
adopted to approximate the relative magnitude and
the reversal direction of the Sn ﬂux, Fig. 7b plots the
Sn ﬂux at selected locations. Figure 7c plots the
data in Fig. 7a and b together. This ﬁgure shows
that for the majority of these selected locations,
the directions of electron charge ﬂow match the ini-
tial movements of Pb grains, whichmay provide sup-
porting evidence of the correlation between these
two phenomena. Notably, the experimental observa-
tions were made over a period during which the
vacancy ﬂux diverged, inducing additional diffusion
(current crowding effect), but the numerical results
refer only to the directions of initial ﬂow of electron
charges, because the numerical model considered
only the solder bump at its initial stage. Further-
more, the numerical model also cannot represent
the diffusion of complex atoms.
According to the above discussion, electromigra-
tion induced a primary Sn ﬂux and the vacancy gra-
dient induced a secondary Sn ﬂux. The primary Sn
ﬂux directly induced by electromigration was direc-
ted downward, and the secondary Sn ﬂux induced
by the vacancy concentration gradient was directed
from right to left. Since the direction of the electron
charge ﬂow matched that of the Sn atoms nicely in
region C, the dominant diffusion mechanism in
region C was inferred to be by electromigration only.
Therefore, the medium Pb grain displacement in
region C, 9 mm, is used to calculate the DZ*. Based
on the assumption that the Sn matrix had the same
displacements but in the opposite direction as the
Pb grains under stressing, the drift velocity n of Sn
is estimated to be 9 mm/1,000 min. The mean atom
drift velocity n caused by the electron current is
given by the following equation:
n 5
DeZ
kT
rj (1)
where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient, e is the electron
charge, Z* is the effective charge number of the Sn
atom, r is the metal resistivity, j is the electron cur-
rent density, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the
absolute temperature. Here, the average current
density of 3.1 3 104 A/cm2 is used for j, and T is
381 K. The r value is 32 mVcm at 100°C.14 From
Eq. 1, DZ* was calculated to be 5 3 1010 cm2/s.
CONCLUSIONS
The effect of electromigration and current crowd-
ing on solder bump was observed in situ. In the
central region of the joint, the Sn ﬂux was driven
mainly by direct electromigration, and produced a
primary Sn ﬂux in the same direction as the elec-
tron ﬂow. Furthermore, a secondary Sn ﬂux was
near the current crowding region. This ﬂux was
generated by the vacancy concentration gradient
and was toward the current crowding region. The
vacancy concentration gradient was induced by
direct electromigration. The displacements of the
Pb grains were measured, and the DZ* value of
Sn in eutectic SnPb solder was estimated to be
5 3 1010 cm2/s.

A new electromigration failure mechanism in ﬂip-chip solder joints is
reported. The solder joints failed by local melting of a PbSn eutectic solder.
Local melting occurred due to a sequence of events induced by the microstruc-
ture changes in the ﬂip-chip solder joint. The formation of a depression in the
current-crowding region of a solder joint induced the local electrical resistance
to increase. The rising local resistance resulted in a larger Joule heating,
which, in turn, raised the local temperature. When the local temperature rose
above the eutectic temperature of the PbSn solder, the solder joint melted and
consequently failed. The results of this study suggest that a dynamic, coupled
simulation that takes into account the microstructure evolution, current den-
sity distribution, and temperature distribution may be needed to fully solve
this problem.
Key words: Electromigration, ﬂip chip, PbSn solder, local melting
INTRODUCTION
The electromigration failure is one of the major
reliability concerns in ﬂip-chip technology.1–3 In cir-
cuit design today, each solder joint will carry more
than 0.2 A, and this will reach 0.4 A in the near
future. At present, the diameter of a solder joint is
about 100 mm, and it will soon be reduced to 50 mm.
This means that the average current density in such
a 50-mm joint is about 104 A/cm2 when a 0.2 A cur-
rent is applied. Furthermore, due to the geometry of
a ﬂip-chip solder joint, current crowding occurs at
the solder/interconnect interface, which is also the
entrance of the electrons into the joint. The current
density in current-crowding region is about 1 order
of magnitude higher than the average current den-
sity in solder joint.4 In addition, the current density
needed to cause electromigration in eutectic PbSn is
2 orders of magnitude smaller than that for Al and
Cu interconnects.5–7 These are the reasons why
electromigration in ﬂip-chip solder joints can be
the major reliability problem in microelectronic
devices. Many studies have been carried out recently
on this subject.8–20
In the literature, the void formation-and-propaga-
tion mechanism has been identiﬁed to be a major
failure mechanism due to electromigration in ﬂip-
chip solder joints.4 In this mechanism, a void ﬁrst
initiates from the current-density crowding region.
Then it extends along the under bump metallurgy
(UBM)/solder interface across the entire contact and
forms a gap between the UBM and solder. The for-
mation of the gap at the UBM/solder interface indu-
ces open circuit failure.
Furthermore, during propagation of the void, the
presence of the void and the microstructure changes
induced by the void also affect the electrical charac-
teristics of the solder joint. With the presence of the
void, the effective current density increases as the
total available cross-sectional area for electrical con-
duction decreases. In addition, the resistance of the
contact area rises due to this smaller conduction
area. These two factors make the Joule heating at
the contact area increase. This, in turn, raises the
temperature of the solder joint; thus the tempera-
ture of the solder joint increases as the void grows.
If the temperature rises above the melting point of
the solder before a complete gap forms between the
UBM and the solder, the solder joint will melt, which
may lead to the failure of the joint. Nevertheless, the(Received June 20, 2005; accepted November 22, 2005)

local? As shown in Fig. 4b, in the lower part of this
joint there were several large Pb-rich grains that
did not melt. This suggests that the melting was
local. To the best of our knowledge, the local melting
of the current-crowding region has never been
reported before. This result indicates that, in addi-
tion to the void formation-and-propagation mecha-
nism, solder joints under current stressing could
also fail through the local melting mechanism.
The top surface temperature of the chip during
the current stressing is shown in Fig. 5. It should be
noted that the temperature proﬁle shown in Fig. 5
was from a different sample shown in Figs. 2–4. The
sample shown in Fig. 5 follows the same failure
mechanism as that of the sample shown in Figs.
2–4; the temperature and resistance proﬁles were
also quite similar. The temperature increased
rapidly from room temperature to 108°C within
5 min. of the current stressing. Subsequently, the
temperature increased very slowly until the cur-
rent-stressing time reached 85 h, after which the
temperature rose rapidly and went beyond the PbSn
eutectic temperature at 183°C. More speciﬁcally,
the temperature rose from 122 to 150°C in 40 min.

change, local resistance rise, and local temperature
rise. Eventually, the solder joint failed catastrophically.
CONCLUSIONS
It was shown through in-situ observation that
ﬂip-chip solder joints under current stressing could
fail through a local melting phenomenon. Before the
local melting, a depression formed due to electromi-
gration near the main current-crowding region. It
was proposed that this depression induced a local
increase in resistance. The rising local resistance
combined with the higher local current density
resulted in the rise of the local temperature at the
main current-crowding region. When the local tem-
perature went beyond the melting point of solder,
local melting occurred. After the local melting, the
joint would fail rather quickly.

54 failure mechanism in greater detail. In situ experiments
55 of this nature are signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult to perform
56 compared to the conventional technique of stressing-

Nos. 1 and 2 joints are shown in Fig. 1. The electrons

joints had a nominal diameter of 125 lm. The UBM
on the chip side was a layer of 14 lm thick Cu with a
dish-shaped rim, and the metallization on the substrate

area of 50 · 5.5 lm. Standard underﬁll was applied be-
tween the chip and the substrate.
To observe the electromigration in situ, the two sol-
der joints were cross-sectioned in half, and polished be-
fore the current-stressing. The cross-section cut across
the center of each joint as shown schematically in Fig.
1. Current-stressing was carried out at an ambient tem-
perature of 30 C. A constant 1.27 A current was passed
through the Nos. 1 and 2 joints, producing a nominal
current density of 4 · 104 A/cm2. This nominal current
density was calculated on the basis of half of the opening
area of the UBM. The local current density in the Cu
line on the chip between Nos. 1 and 2 solder joints
was 9.2 · 105 A/cm2 since the Cu lines had a much smal-
ler cross-section area (50 · 5.5 lm before being sec-
tioned). The local current density in the Cu line on the
substrate was 5.5 · 105 A/cm2 as the conducting cross-
section there was larger.
The surface microstructure changes were monitored
with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In order
to perform the observation, we had to stop the cur-
rent-stressing, and place the specimen under the micro-
scope. After the observation, the current-stressing was
resumed using the same specimen. In other words, the
current-stressing was interrupted several times. The re-
ported current-stressing time was cumulative. That is
to say that the reported current-stressing time was the
summation of all the time that current had passed
through the specimen before a speciﬁc observation.
The phases were identiﬁed using the energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy.
The surface temperature of the backside of the chip
(the side without any active devices) at the location di-
rectly opposite to Nos. 1 and 2 joints was monitored
by attaching a ﬁne-gauge thermocouple to the backside
surface. During current stressing, the temperature of the
chip rose above the ambient temperature (30 C) as a re-
sult of the Joule heating eﬀect. The backside surface
temperature of the chip (the side without any active de-
vices) would rise with the current-stressing time and
reach a stable temperature of 166 C in about 6 min.
During observation, the specimen cooled to room tem-
perature. Since the cross-sectional area of the Cu lines
on the chip was much smaller than that of the solder
joints as well as that of the Cu conducting traces on
the substrate, the Cu lines on the chip had a higher over-
all electrical resistance than the sum of the total resis-
tance of the solder joint and the Cu conducting traces
on the substrate. Consequently, the primary heat source
due to Joule heating was the Cu lines on the chip. In this
study, the total electrical resistance of the Cu lines on
the chip was about 0.026 X, and the constant current
passed through Nos. 1 and 2 joints was 1.27 A. As a re-
sult, the Joule heating power from Cu line on the chip
was 0.042 W. The temperature gradient between the
lia xxx (2005) xxx–xxx137Cu lines and backside surface of Si chip can be estimated

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the cross-sections of Nos. 2
and 1 joints, respectively, before applying current. The
bright areas in the joints are Pb-rich regions and dark
areas are Sn-rich regions. There were scallop-type
Cu6Sn5 compounds formed over the disk-shaped Cu
UBM. These Cu6Sn5 formed during the two reﬂows to
produce the specimen. The intermetallic compound over
the Ni layer on the substrate side was too thin to be re-
solved by SEM. The two black dots in Fig. 2(b) are
embedded diamond particles from polishing.
After 30 min of current-stressing, no change in micro-
structure that could be directly attributed to electromi-
gration was observed, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d).
However, after 50 min, a void was observed near the en-
trance of electrons into the No. 2 joint, as shown in Fig.
2(e). This location of this void is consistent with the sim-
ulation and observation of Yeh et al. [4]. The initiation
of the void at this location is due to the substantial cur-
rent-crowding here. Yeh et al. also reported a long per-
iod of incubation time in their electrical resistance
monitoring. In our study, we similarly noticed that
nothing pronounced occurred at least during the ﬁrst
30 min, and a rapid change occurred after the observa-
tion of the ﬁrst void at 50 min. Fig. 3(a) shows the
zoom-in view of the void in Fig. 2(e). As can be seen
here, this void formed between Cu6Sn5 and the solder.
It should be noted that at this stage those Cu6Sn5 scal-
lops immediately above the void were still intact. In
addition, there were many small particles, between Cu
and Cu6Sn5, extruding above the surface. Our prelimin-
ary analysis using electron microprobe revealed they
were probably newly formed Cu6Sn5. Detailed analysis
for their identity is underway. Despite the formation
of a void in the No. 2 joint at 50 min, there still was
not any clear evidence of change due to electromigration
in No. 1 joint, as shown in Fig. 2(f). Similar to the No. 2
joint, there were many small particles extruding above
the surface between Cu and Cu6Sn5 in the No. 1 joint.
Consequently, it can be concluded that the formation
of these particles was not related to the direction of elec-
tron ﬂow.
After 65 min, the void had quickly propagated to the
left and become larger, as shown in Fig. 2(g). When the
time reached 75 min, the void grew even larger, as
shown in Fig. 2(i). From the series of images shown in
Fig. 2(a), (c), (e), (g), and (i), we can see that the se-
quence of events can be described as below. A void ﬁrst
initiated at the upper-right corner of the No. 2 joint.
This location coincided with the high current crowding
region. Once the void formed, the electrons were di-
verted to the left of the void, causing the void to grow
to that direction. Consequently, the void propagated
along the UBM/solder interface. Fig. 3(b) shows the
zoom-in view of the void in Fig. 2(g). Above this void,
those Cu6Sn5 scallops that formed during reﬂow had

In other words, the No. 1 joint was still electrically con-
ductive at 87 min. The melting of this joint was probably
caused by the heat generated in the No. 2 joints. The
standoﬀ here decreased from 73 to 65 lm, not as large
as that of the No. 2 joint. This observation also supports
the proposition that the No. 1 joint was melted due to
the heat from the No. 2 joint. The letters F, G, and H
are used to marked some of the traceable features in
Fig. 2(j) and (l). As can be seen in these two ﬁgures, re-
gions F and G still retained the outlines of the grains.
This observation suggests that the melting was partial,
and parts of the joint did not melt. This is probably be-
cause regions F and G were Pb-rich grains, as shown in
Fig. 2(j), and these large Pb-rich grains had a melting
point higher than the PbSn eutectic temperature of
183 C. The proposition that the No. 1 joint melted
due to the heat from the No. 2 joint can additionally
be explained from the following arguments. The stea-
dy-state temperature here depended on the heat input
rate (Joule heating and heat conduction from the higher
temperature regions nearby) and the heat output rate
(dissipation through heat conduction away to lower
temperature regions nearby). Before substantial micro-
structural change occurred in the No. 2 joint, the heat
input to the No. 1 joint was only due to the local Joule
heating. The heat conduction from the No. 2 joint was
small and negligible at this stage.When the void in No.
2 joint grew to very large, the local resistance there in-
creased. The increasing local resistance made the local
temperature of the No. 2 joint increase. The moment
the No. 2 joint melted, this temperature increase became
even larger. At this stage, the heat conduction from the
No. 2 to No. 1 joint could no longer be ignored. With
this extra heat input from the No. 2 joint, the tempera-
ture of the No. 1 joint increased over its steady-state
temperature, and the No. 2 joint eventually melted.
Comparing the re-polished surfaces shown in Fig.
2(m) and (n), we can see that the Cu UBM in No. 1 joint
did not dissolve as extensively. In other words, electro-
migration in the No. 1 joint did not produce a similar
extensive metal dissolution and failure. There are two
possible reasons for the diﬀerence [6]. The ﬁrst has been
pointed out earlier and is due to the fact that the con-
ducting trace on the substrate side is thicker than on
the chip side. A thicker conducting line can reduce cur-
rent crowding by spreading out the current distribution.
The second is that Ni on the substrate side is more resis-
tant to dissolution driven by electromigration than Cu
is. It is known that the rate of Ni dissolution into molten
eutectic SnPb solder is one order of magnitude slower
than that of Cu, and this might also be true in solid
state. Nevertheless, electromigration still had a clear ef-
fect on the No. 1 joint, such as the location of the
Cu6Sn5 intermetallic. As shown in Fig. 2(n), Cu6Sn5
was distributed more randomly in this joint. One inter-
6 Y.H. Lin et al. / Acta Maesting question is that why had Cu6Sn5 not just formedCT
ED
Pleads to the suggestion that the incubation time is a goodindicator of the real lifetime of a joint under current-stressing. A theory that can predict the incubation time
will then be just as good as a theory than can predict the
lifetime of a solder joint for practical applications. Be-
fore the void nucleation, the joint underwent very little
microstructure change. On the other hand, the joint
experienced substantial changes in microstructure be-
fore failure. Therefore, it should be much easier to de-
rive a theory for the void nucleation than for the
whole failure process. In other words, it would be more
sensible to concentrate future theoretical or modeling ef-
forts toward predicting the incubation time, instead of
the lifetime before failure.
4. Conclusion
The void formation-and-propagation failure mecha-
nism induced by electromigration were observed in situ.
In the joint with electrons ﬂowing from the chip side to
the substrate side, no apparent microstructure change
was observed in the ﬁrst 30–50 min. After this incuba-
tion period, a void nucleated near the current crowding
region. This void then propagated across the UBM very
quickly, and eventually resulted in the failure of the sol-
der joint in about another 40 min. The failure was con-
current with the melting of the joint. Re-polishing of the
failed joint revealed that an extensive Cu UBM dissolu-
tion had occurred. The dissolved Cu atoms were driven
to the substrate side and formed Cu6Sn5. The results of
this study show that the geometry of the UBM might
have to be optimized to achieve a more uniform current
distribution in order to reduce failures caused by the
current crowding. This study also shows that modelingOO
F
near the anode side (the Cu UBM/solder interface) since
there was plenty of Cu nearby and the electromigration
factor also favored the formation of Cu6Sn5 there. What
was the driving force for Cu6Sn5 to be distributed
throughout the joint? Recently, it had been pointed
out that Cu and Ni could cross-interact across a solder
joint [17]. This interaction can drive the Cu atoms from
the Cu/solder interface to the solder/Ni interface to form
(Cu1  xNix)6Sn5. It can be seen in Fig. 2(n) that much
of this compound did form near the solder/Ni interface.
The electromigration is the factor responsible for driving
this compound away from the solder/Ni interface to in-
side the solder. In other words, the Cu–Ni cross-interac-
tion drove the Cu atoms to the solder/Ni interface to
form the compound, and electromigration drove some
of this compound back into the solder.
It should be pointed out that the importance of the
incubation time before void nucleation cannot be over-
emphasized. According to the results of this study, after
lia xxx (2005) xxx–xxx478the incubation time is a more sensible way of approach-

The electromigration failure mechanism in flip-chip solder joints through the
rapid dissolution of the Cu metallization was studied in detail. The ambient
temperature was found to be a very important factor in this failure mecha-
nism. When the ambient temperature was changed from 100°C to 70°C,
the time to failure changed from 95 min to 31 days. The results of this study
indicate that temperature, as an experimental variable, is not less important
than the current density in electromigration study. The surface temperatures
of the chip and substrate during electromigration were also measured. The
temperature of the Si chip was reasonably homogeneous because of the fact
that Si is a very good thermal conductor. It was also reasoned that the high
thermal conductivity of the PbSn solder could not support a temperature
gradient large enough to induce thermomigration across the solder joint in
the present study. Experimentally, no evidence of mass transport caused by
thermomigration was observed.

INTRODUCTION
One of the major advantages of flip-chip technol-
ogy is its superior electrical performance because
of its shorter electrical connection length between
the chip and substrate. Flip-chip technology has
been the dominating packaging solution for high
performance chips and will remain so in the fore-
seeable future. As the chip complexity increases, the
input/output (I/O) density on each chip also in-
creases. To accommodate the continuing rise of the
I/O density, the diameter of the flip-chip solder joints
must shrink. The shrinking of the solder joints in-
evitably raises the current density passing through
the flip-chip solder joints. It is anticipated that cur-
rent density will reach 104 A/cm2 in a few years. Two
phenomena have to be considered in view of this high
level of current density: electromigration1–8 and ther-
momigration.9 Electromigration had been shown to
cause failures in flip-chip solder joints through a void
formation and propagation mechanism.4 Recently, it
was found that electromigration could also cause fail-
ure through the mechanism of rapid Cu under-bump
metallization (UBM) dissolution.7 A review article on
electromigration was published very recently.8
Thermomigration had also been proposed to cause
reliability problems in flip-chip solder joints.9 During
current stressing, heat is generated due to Joule
heating. Because the cross-section area of the metal
lines on the chip side is much smaller than those of
the solder joints and the metal conducting traces
on the substrate side, the metal lines on the chip
have a higher overall electrical resistance compared
to those of the solder joints and the metal conducting
traces on the substrate. Therefore, the primary heat
source due to Joule heating is the metal lines on a
chip. This local heat source induces a temperature
gradient across the solder joint, going down from
the chip side to the substrate side. Because of this
temperature gradient, thermomigration creates a
net atom flux toward the cooler side. This net atom
transport leads to the formation of voids near the
chip side9 and could cause joint failures.
In this study, we looked into the failure mecha-
nism through Cu UBM dissolution reported earlier7
in greater detail. Specifically, we would like to know
the effect of ambient temperature on this failure
mechanism. We also monitored the chip surface
temperature and the substrate surface temperature
so that we could evaluate the importance of ther-
momigration in our samples during high-intensity
current stressing.

backside surface temperature of the chip (the side
without any active devices) when the ambient
temperature was set at 100°C. Also shown is the
backside surface temperature of the substrate
(opposite to the side where the chip was mounted).
The temperatures in Fig. 3 were measured by plac-
ing fine-gauge thermocouples on the backsides of
the chip or the substrate at the locations immedi-
ately above or below solder joint No. 2. It should be
noted that the metal line on the chip between joints
No. 1 and 2 was the primary heat source during
current stressing. In Fig. 3, both temperatures
increased initially due to Joule heating, and then
reached steady-state temperatures in a few minutes
when the Joule heating was balanced by heat dissi-
pation. When the ambient temperature was 100°C,
the steady-state temperatures for the backside chip
surface and backside substrate surface were 157°C
and 131°C, respectively. When the ambient tempera-
ture was 70°C, these two temperatures evolved
similarly, but the steady-state temperatures become
122°C and 98°C, respectively. The steady-state tem-
peratures, such as those reported here, depend on
the heat generation rate (due to Joule heating) and
the heat dissipation rate. The heat generation rate
is proportional to the product of the voltage drop
across the circuit and the applied current. Most of
the voltage drop in a flip-chip system occurs across
the chip itself. Therefore, the heat generation rate
depends strongly on the chip resistance design. The
heat dissipation rate depends strongly on factors
such as die size, heat sink, underfill, etc. As will be
described later, temperature is a very important
factor in electromigration of solder joints, so both
the chip resistance design and the heat dissipation
capability are important factors for a given current
stressing experiment. The current density alone is
not enough to fully characterize an electromigration
experiment in a flip-chip system. The voltage drop
across the chip and the heat dissipation conditions
have also to be described in reporting electromigra-
tion study. Of course, it is always best to monitor the
surface temperature and joint temperature directly.
The backside surface temperatures of the chip at
other locations were also monitored in this study. As
shown in Fig. 1 for the case of 100°C ambient tem-
perature, the backside of the chip was divided into
nine regions, and the steady-state temperatures for
these nine regions were recorded. The temperature
difference diagonally across the chip, which covers
a distance of several thousands microns, was very
small, only 6.2°C. This can be attributed to the fact
that Si is a very good thermal conductor (thermal
conductivity  148 Wm1K1). From this observa-
tion, we can reasonably expect that the front-
side chip surface temperature in contact with joint
No. 2 was not very different from 157°C because the
thickness of the Si wafer was only 300 µm.
It is very difficult to experimentally measure the
temperature profile across the solder joint from the
chip side to the substrate side. This temperature
profile information is important to judge the contri-
bution of mass transport through thermomigration.
Accurate prediction of this temperature profile can
only be resorted to elaborate computer simulation.
Here, only qualitative considerations are presented.
The PbSn eutectic has a thermal conductivity of
50 Wm1K1, which is about one third that of Si.
The height of the solder joints was about 100 µm.
The substrate was made of FR-4 and had a very
poor thermal conductivity (0.35 Wm1K1). The
thickness of the substrate was 500 µm. As shown in
Fig. 1, the backside surface temperature of the sub-
strate directly below joint No. 2 was 131°C. Conse-
quently, the total temperature difference between
the backside of the chip and the backside of the 
substrate near joint No. 2 was (157  131)  26°C.
Considering the thermal conductivities of Si, PbSn 
solder, and FR-4, as well as the thickness of the Si
wafer, solder joint, and the substrate, one can rea-
sonably expect that the actual temperature drop
across the solder joint itself was a small fraction of
the 26°C. Most of the temperature drop occurred
within the substrate. This small temperature differ-
ence across the solder joint itself leads one to sug-
gest that thermomigration may not be an important
factor within the solder joint in our study.
Observations from Experiments at 100°C
Ambient Temperature
Figure 4 shows the event of microstructure evolu-
tion in the No. 2 solder joint. A more detailed de-
scription for Fig. 4 had been reported in a previous
letter.7 In each micrograph, electrons entered the
joint from the upper-left corner and left through the
lower-right corner. The progress of Cu dissolution in
the upper-left corner as a function of time is clearly
visible. The effect of current crowding can be seen
very clearly because of the asymmetric dissolution.
It took only 95 min for the bump to fail through
extensive Cu dissolution. Not only the dish-shaped
Cu UBM, but also part of the Cu line was consumed.
The dissolved Cu regions were backfilled with sol-
der. The part of the Cu line that was backfilled with
solder had a much higher tendency to fail because
the local current density was much higher there and
because the solder is less resistant to electromigra-
tion than Cu. The dissolved Cu atoms were driven
by electromigration to the anode side, and a large
amount of Cu6Sn5 formed. Figure 5 is a top-view
optical micrograph for the No. 2 joint after 95-min
current stressing. The solder had been etched away
to reveal the failure site. The regions in which Cu
had been dissolved and backfilled with solder are
also clearly visible.
As had been pointed out in a previous letter,7 elec-
tromigration did not produce similar metal dissolu-
tion and failure in the No. 1 joint (electron flowing
from the substrate side to the chip side). It had been
pointed out that there were three possible reasons
for the difference.7 The first is that Ni on the sub-
strate side is more resistant to dissolution than Cu.

ture gradient across the No. 3 joint was even higher
than that of the No. 2 joint. This is because the 
temperatures of the No. 2 and 3 joints on the chip
side were very close (Fig. 1) because of the fact that
Si is a very good conductor. On the substrate side,
because FR-4 is a poor thermal conductor, the tem-
perature difference between the No. 2 and 3 joints
must be greater. Even though the No. 3 joint had a
greater temperature gradient, there was no evidence
of thermomigration in Fig. 2b of Ref. 7.
In our current stressing experiments, the separa-
tion of the Pb-rich phase was also observed. The
Pb-rich phase formed near the anode side in both
the No. 1 and 2 joints, as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6a
and b is optical micrographs for the No. 1 and 2
solder joints after current stressing for 45 min. The
dark areas are the Pb-rich phase. A SEM image
and an EDX mapping are shown in Fig. 6c and d,
respectively, for the No. 2 joint. The Pb atoms were
driven to the anode side because Pb diffused faster
than Sn did at the temperature of this experiment.8
Electromigration also had a clear effect on the loca-
tion of the Cu6Sn5 intermetallic. As shown in Fig. 6a
and b, Cu6Sn5 always formed near the anode side.
The electrons were able to drive the Cu atoms toward
the anode side and formed Cu6Sn5 there. More inter-
estingly, in the No. 1 joint, we also detected a small
amount of Ni dissolved into Cu6Sn5 and formed
(CuxNi1x)6Sn5. This indicates that electromigration
was also able to drive Ni atoms from the Ni layer in
the substrate surface finish toward the anode side.

joints without certain modifications. Several factors
make the direct adoption of Black&apos;s equation
difficult: complexity in geometry, the current crowd-
ing effect, the presence of a temperature gradient,
and the presence of multiple materials (solder and
UBM) as well as their interactions. It is highly de-
sirable that a counterpart of Black&apos;s equation
can be derived for electromigration in solder joints.
This is because industry needs such an equation to
serve as a guide to set its design rules. The search-
ing of such an equation will be a highly important
and rewarding research area.
The results of this study indicate that the ambient
temperature and, more importantly, the joint tem-
perature are dominant factors in current stressing
experiments. These temperatures are mainly deter-
mined by the Joule heating and the heat dissipation.
The Joule heating is a variable that can be easily
controlled and is well characterized in all the studies
reported in the literature. The heat dissipation, how-
ever, is more complicated, and is a variable that
tends not to be well characterized in the past. This
ambiguity makes it difficult to compare results from
different laboratories. Therefore, in future studies,
factors relating to heat dissipation have to be de-
scribed clearly. Of course, the actual joint tempera-
ture, if it can be measured, will give an even better
characterization of electromigration study.
CONCLUSIONS
The surface temperatures of the chip and sub-
strate during electromigration were measured. The
temperature of the Si chip was reasonably homoge-
neous because of the fact that Si is a very good
thermal conductor. It was also reasoned that the
high thermal conductivity of the PbSn solder could
not support a temperature gradient large enough to
induce thermomigration in the present study.
The effect of temperature on the time-to-failure is
very strong. When the ambient temperature was
changed from 100°C to 70°C, the time to failure
changed from 95 min to 31 days. Therefore, in future
studies, factors relating to heat dissipation have to
be well controlled. Development of techniques to ac-
curately measure or simulate the joint temperature
distribution during current stressing will be an im-
portant step in studying electromigration in flip-chip
solder joints.

grain 3 to grain 2, yet a smaller vacancy flux leaves grain
boundary II going into grain 2. This smaller vacancy flux
then goes through grain 2 and reaches grain boundary I. Cor-
respondingly, a larger vacancy flux is leaving the grain
boundary I and goes into the grain 1. In grain 2, depletion
sundersaturationd of vacancies occurs at the grain boundary I
and corresponds to a compressive stresses near the boundary.
On the other hand, supersaturation of vacancies and corre-
sponding tensile stresses occur at grain boundary II. This
behavior is different from that in isotropic materials; when
the electron flow direction is from left to right, we expect the
right-hand side sanoded of the grain is under compression
and the left-hand side scathoded is under tension.11
In this model, the divergence of vacancies at the grain
boundaries such that the vertical gradient of stresses acts as
the vertical forces at each atom in the grain boundaries. It
acts down satomic flux moves downd at grain boundary II,
but up at grain boundary I. Therefore, this pair of forces
generates a clockwise torque and leads to the rotation of the
bad grain.

Since the vertical gradient is what makes the torque to rotate
the grain, it is important to correlate the vacancy concentra-

more noticeable microstructural change in Sn than in Al and
Cu under electromigration. White tin sb-Snd has a body-
centered-tetragonal structure, and its lattice parameters are
a=b=5.83 Å and c=3.18 Å. The resistivity is 13.25 mV cm
along the a and b axes and 20.27 mV cm along the c axis.
Due to the anisotropy, we suggest that the observed voltage
drop is caused by a reorientation of Sn grains to realign
themselves so that their a or b axis is along the current di-
rection, effectively reducing resistance. Synchrotron radia-
tion white beam x-ray microdiffraction8–11 was used in this
study to follow grain-by-grain changes in thin-film Sn stripes
under electromigration. In this letter, we report that under
electromigration, low-resistance grains in Sn stripes grow at
the expense of neighboring high-resistance grains. A mecha-
nism of grain growth under electromigration, very different
from that in conventional grain growth by thermal annealing,
is proposed and discussed.
The x-ray microdiffraction station was set up on beam-
line 7.3.3. at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory.12 The sample was raster-
scanned under a 1 mm x-ray white beam and a Laue diffrac-
tion pattern was taken by a charge coupled device detector at
each step. Since the grains in our sample were larger than
1 mm, each grain can be treated as a single crystal with
0.01° precision and compared.
We define the sample coordinates system as Z being the
sample surface normal, X being the length direction of the
stripe coinciding with the applied electrical current direction,
and Y being the in-plane direction transverse to the stripe.

2492 Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 85, No. 13, 27 September 2004 Wu et al.lattice diffusion since no lattice diffusion is needed. Both of
the deductions disagree with the experimental observations,
so the mechanism depicted in Fig. 3 is questionable. In Al
stripes with a bamboo-like microstructure, the current flows
normally to the grain boundaries, so we expect grain bound-
aries to migrate under electromigration. Yet hardly any report
has mentioned grain growth in this situation. In the model of
electromigration-induced back-stress gradient within a bam-
boo grain by Korhonen et al.,14 the grain boundaries were
assumed to be static.
In classical models of normal grain growth, no long-
range lattice diffusion is required. However, native oxide on
a Sn surface as well as the grooving could have a pinning
effect on grain boundaries. Hence, a high activation energy
as in lattice diffusion is needed to migrate those grain bound-
aries. Vacancy diffusion in the lattice needs to be considered
for a lattice diffusion mediated grain growth. In Fig. 3, the
anode side on grain 1 is under compression due to electromi-
gration, but the cathode side of grain 2 is under tension. We
have grain growth instead of hillock growth at the anode side
of a grain. The space needed for the growth can be accom-
modated partly by vacancy condensation in the grain bound-
ary from the cathode. In an isotropic and bamboo-like mi-
crostructure, all grain boundaries are expected to migrate
toward the anode; there is only displacement of grains but no
grain growth. Yet in anisotropic materials, such as Sn, the
high-resistance grain can be consumed by a neighboring
low-resistance grain, and grain growth occurs. In Fig. 4, a Sn
line was stressed with a current density of 23104 A/cm2 at
100 °C for 500 h. Grains indicated by arrows grew asym-
metrically, grain boundaries moved toward the anode. How-
ever, it should be noted that one grain, which is indicated by
a dotted arrow, actually grew in the opposite direction. The
mechanism of grain growth under electromigration is intrigu-
ing and requires more thorough study.

literature. During electromigration in Al lines, it was 
reported that the grain boundaries move towards the anode, 
i.e., grain boundaries move in the direction of electron flow 
[3]. 
Furthermore, the measured activation energy is close 
to that of lattice diffusion rather than grain boundary 
diffusion. In Fig. 1, grain boundaries were also moving 
towards the anode. Though the activation energy was not  
measured, the temperature was high enough for lattice 
diffusion to be dominant.  
In classical models of normal grain growth, no long 
range lattice diffusion is required. However, native oxide 
on Sn surface as well as the grooving could have a pinning 
effect on grain boundaries. Hence, a high activation energy 
as in lattice diffusion is needed to migrate those grain 
boundaries. Vacancy diffusion in the lattice needs to be 
considered for a lattice diffusion mediated grain growth. In  
Figure 2, a Sn line was stressed with a current density of 2 
x 104 A/cm2 at 100qC for 500 hrs. Grains indicated by 
arrows grew asymmetrically, grain boundaries moved 
toward anode. However, it should be noted that one grain 
which is indicated by a dotted arrow actually grew in the 
opposite direction. The mechanism of grain growth under  
electromigration is intriguing and requires a more thorough 
study.  
The diffraction Laue pattern can also be used to 
analyze deviatoric stress distribution along the stripe when  
lattice parameters are determined in each grain. Since 
deviatoric stress V’xx + V’yy + V’zz = 0, by definition, -V’zz is 
a measure of the in-plane stress. For a non-passivated film, 
we assume an average total normal stress Vzz= 0. Therefore, 
we can calculate biaxial normal stress Vb = (Vxx + Vyy)/2 = 
(V’xx + V’yy)/2 –V’zz = -3 V’zz/2. If we examine the result of 
stress distribution, an obvious stress relaxation can be 
observed after electromigration. The coefficient of thermal 
expansion in Sn is 22 x 10-6 /oC and 2.6 x 10-6 /oC in Si 
substrate. When the sample was cooled down from the 
annealing temperature, the Sn stripe should be under 
tension. Under electromigration, residue stress was released 
along the whole line. Furthermore, there is an obvious 
stress gradient in grain growth region 2, more tensile at the 
cathode end of the grain and less tensile at the anode end. 
In the  classical Blech structure electromigration model 
[4], the anode side tends to be more compressive and more 
tensile in cathode side. Our result shows a similar 
phenomenon within a grain. There is also stress gradient in 
region 1, but it’s more localized in the grain and less 
obvious than in region 2. The initial orientation of grains is 
an important factor to affect the final grain size.  
Summary 
Synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction provides a grain-
by-grain analysis of the microstructural evolution in Sn 
stripe under electromigration. Grain growth of low 
resistance grains that leads to a voltage drop of the stripe 
was observed.

14-m-thick Cu with a dish-shaped rim, and the metal-
lization on the substrate side is a bilayer of 0.25-m Au
and 3-m Ni over the Cu conducting trace [Fig. 1(b)].
The electromigration test was conducted in an oven set at
100 °C. A constant current of 1.27 A was passed through
the pair of bumps, producing a nominal current density of
2.5 × 104 A/cm2 (based on the opening area of the UBM).
The chip temperature was monitored by attaching a ther-
malcouple to the backside of the chip. Due to Joule heat-
ing, the backside of the chip reached a steady state
temperature of 157 °C after 10 min of testing.
Figure 2(a) shows a cross-sectional scanning electron
microscope (SEM) image of a failed No. 2 bump. It took
95 min for the bump to fail by showing an abrupt increase
in resistance through extensive Cu dissolution in the upper-
left corner. Not only the dish-shaped Cu UBM, but also
part of the Cu conducting trace was consumed. The dis-
solved Cu regions were backfilled with solder. Since the
Cu trace had a cross-section area of 50 × 5.5 m, the
local current density in the Cu trace was much higher
(4.6 × 105 A/cm2) than the nominal current density in the
bump. The part of the conducting trace that was back-
filled with solder had a much higher tendency to fail than
the original Cu conducting trace since electromigration
in the solder is much faster than Cu under the same
current density. The dissolved Cu atoms were driven by
electromigration to the anode (substrate) side, and a large
amount of Cu6Sn5 was formed in the solder bump. More
than 15 pairs of similar failure were observed. The same
failure occurs even at room temperatures with a higher
applied current density.
For comparison, Fig. 2(b) shows the cross-sectional
SEM image of the neighboring No. 3 bump after the test.
Without current stressing, no apparent difference in mi-
crostructure can be seen in No. 3 bump before and after

the test. There is no obvious dissolution of Cu and no
formation of Cu6Sn5 in the No. 3 solder bump. Recently,
it was shown that thermomigration could play an impor-
tant role in flip-chip solder joints under direct current
(dc) current stressing.14 Although there is no evidence of
thermomigration in No. 3 bump, the effect of thermomi-
gration is a very interesting area worthy of careful ex-
amination in future studies.
Figure 3 shows the event of microstructure evolution
in No. 1 as well as No. 2 bump. The progress of the Cu
dissolution in the No. 2 bump as a function of time is
clearly visible. By measuring the length of the consumed
Cu trace, we estimated that the dissolution rate of the Cu
trace was about 1 m/min. The effect of current crowd-
ing can be seen very clearly in the No. 2 bump because
of the asymmetric dissolution. It started at the upper-left
corner near the entrance of electrons into the solder bump
and became observable after 15 min of electromigration.
The simulation of current density distribution in a flip
chip solder bump having a thick UBM by Yeh et al.
indeed showed that the highest current-crowding occurs
in the UBM.9 As the time of current stressing increased,
more Cu was dissolved into the solder of the No. 2 bump
and more Cu6Sn5 formed near the anode side. The large
hole in the 90 min case was original occupied by Cu6Sn5,
but this piece of Cu6Sn5 fell off during sample prepara-
tion. It is amazing that such a large quantity of Cu6Sn5
can be formed in the solder by a continuous dissolution
of Cu from the UBM. It will affect the mechanical prop-
erties of the joint.
In contrast to the pronounced dissolution phenomenon
shown in the No. 2 bump, electromigration in the No. 1
bump did not produce similar metal dissolution and fail-
ure. There are three possible reasons for the difference.
The first is that Ni on the substrate side is more resistant
to dissolution driven by electromigration than Cu. It is
known that the rate of Ni dissolution into molten eutectic
SnPb solder is much slower than that of Cu and this
might also be true in solid state.15,16 The second is that
the conducting trace on the substrate side is much thicker
than on the chip side (Fig. 2). A thicker conducting line
can reduce current crowding by spreading out the current
distribution. The third is that electromigration in No. 1
bump is counteracted by thermomigration to a certain
degree.14 In No. 1 bump, thermomigration tends to drive
atoms from the chip side to the substrate side because
the chip side is at a higher temperature. Nevertheless,
electromigration was still able to leave noticeable
changes in the No. 1 bump. As shown in Fig. 3, a small
amount of intermetallic compound was still located pref-
erably near the anode side (chip side). Moreover, in the
60 min case and beyond, phase separation can be seen
in the solder by the migration of the Pb-rich phase toward
the anode side. This is because Pb is the dominant dif-
fusing species at temperatures above 100 °C.17
The dissolution rate of the Cu trace is shown in Fig. 4.
Only the length of the dissolved Cu trace is included in
plotting Fig. 4. The dissolved region in the dish-shaped
Cu UBM is not counted. On average, the dissolution rate
was 1 m/min. However, it can be seen that the rate of
dissolution increased with the time of current stressing
even though the local current density was at a constant
values of 4.6 × 105 A/cm2. The origin of this accelerating
dissolution is worthy of further study.
In summary, the failure of flip chip solder bumps in-
duced by rapid dissolution of Cu UBM is reported here.
The average dissolution rate was 1 m/min when the
local current density was 4.6 × 105 A/cm2, and the chip
backside surface temperature was 157 °C. The effect of
current crowding revealed itself by asymmetrical disso-
lution. The result of this study shows that Ni, for ex-
ample, which is more resistant to dissolution, could be
used in place of Cu to avoid this type of failure. More-
over, the geometry of the UBM can be optimized to
achieve a more uniform current distribution to reduce
current crowding.
