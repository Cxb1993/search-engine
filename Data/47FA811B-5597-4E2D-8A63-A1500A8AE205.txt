Abstract 
The optoelectronic and device characteristics of bis-(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-6,7-diheptyl- 
[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (BTHTQ)-based, didecyloxyphenylene (DP)-based, and 
bis-[4-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-phenyl] quinoxaline (Qx(EHP))-based alternating copolymers were 
investigated. Firstly in the study of BTHTQ-based conjugated copolymers, the experimental 
results suggests that relatively small band gaps in the range of 1.05-1.43 eV were achieved due to 
intramolecular charge transfer between donor and [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQ) 
segments. Secondly, in the study of didecyloxyphenylene (DP)-based conjugated copolymers, 
we successfully synthesized a series of novel conjugated copolymers by Suzuki coupling 
reaction, and discussed the effects of the acceptor strength and backbone planarity on the optical, 
electrochemical, field-effect charge transport, and photovoltaic properties of the donor-acceptor 
copolymers. The strong acceptor strength of thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP) and coplanar backbone 
in the DP/TP copolymer resulted in a large intramolecular charge transfer, leading to relatively 
high hole mobility (1.89x10-3 cm2V-1s-1). Furthermore, the results also show that the backbone 
planarity of the DP/BT and DP/Q copolymers was significantly improved by incorporating

3.4. Characterization 
UV-Visible absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Jasco 
model UV/VIS/NIR V-570 spectrometer and Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon), 
respectively. Films used for the PL efficiency measurement were drop-coated from THF solution 
onto quartz substrates (ca. 1 wt %). The electrochemical properties of the polymer films were 
investigated on a Princeton Applied Research Model 273A Potentiostat/Galvanostat with a 0.1 M 
acetonitrile (99.5+%, Tedia) solution containing tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate 
(TBABF4) (Fluka, >99.9%) as the electrolyte. Atom force microscopy (AFM) measurements 
were obtained with a NanoScope IIIa AFM (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) at room 
temperature. Commercial silicon cantilevers (Nanosensors, Germany) with typical spring 
constants of 21-78 N．m-1 were used to operate the AFM in tapping mode. Images were taken 
continuously with the scan rate of 1.0 Hz. 
 
 
3.5. Device Fabrication and Testing 
Thin Film Transistors. The thin film transistors were fabricated with a bottom-contact 
configuration on the p-doped silicon wafers. A thermally grown 200 nm SiO2 used as the gate 
dielectric with a capacitance of 17 nF/cm2. Aluminum was used to create a common bottom-gate 
electrode. The source/drain regions were defined by a 10 nm thick chromium adhesion layer and 
a 100 nm thick gold contact electrode through a regular shadow mask, and the channel length (L) 
and width (W) were 25 and 1500 μm, respectively. Afterward, the substrate was modified with 
octyltrichlorosilane (OTS, Fluka, 98%) as silane coupling agents. Output and transfer 
characteristics of the OTFT devices were measured using Keithley 4200 semiconductor 
parametric analyzer. All the prepared procedures and electronic measurements were performed in 
ambient atmosphere. 
Fabrication and Characterization of Polymer Photovoltaic Cells. Before solar device 
fabrication, the ITO-glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonification sequentially in detergent, 
deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The synthesized polymers were dissolved in 
chloroform with the concentration of 10 mg/ml, followed by blending with PCBM and stirred 
overnight in the glove box. 
The polymer solar cell devices were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of polymer/PCBM, 
sandwiched between a transparent anode and a cathode. The anode consisted of glass substrates 
pre-coated with indium tin oxide (ITO), modified by spin-coating 
polyethylenedioxythiophene/polystyrenesulphonate (PEDOT/PSS) layer (~30 nm), and the 
cathode consists of Ca (~35 nm) capped with Al (~130 nm). After device encapsulation, 
current-voltage characteristics of the devices under white-light illumination from AM 1.5 solar 
simulator (100 mW/cm2) were recorded by a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter.

PTTHTQ, PFBTHTQ, and PPBTHTP in dilute chloroform solutions are observed at 727, 752, 
695, and 686 nm, respectively. The red-shifted spectra of the four copolymers in comparison 
with that of the BTHTQ indicate the much stronger delocalization in the case of polymer chain.  
The larger wavelength of absorption maximum of PTTHTQ than those of PFBTHTQ, and 
PPBTHTP is as expected since the thiophene moiety is the stronger electron donor than fluorene 
or phenylene and leads to an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer. The higher wavelength of 
absorption maximum of PTTHTQ than that of PBTHTQ is probably attributed to the backbone 
planarity. The incorporation of the thiophene ring into the BTHTQ backbone probably reduces 
the steric hindrance on the long alkyl side chain and thus enhances the intramolecular charge 
transfer in PTTHTQ. In our previous report, the band gaps increased as the thiophene moiety 
increased in the four thiopehen/ thiophene(TH)-thienopyrazine(TP) conjugated copolymers, 
which is contradictory to the above result between PBTHTQ and PTTHTQ. However, the 
TH-TP copolymers in that report are without any long alkyl side chain on the thiophene moiety. 
Thus, we believe that the difference on the optical band gaps of PBTHTQ and PTTHTQ are 
due to the backbone planarity. 
On the other hand, two absorption peaks centered at 363-450 and 710-876 nm are observed 
in the absorption spectra of thin films similar to those in dilute solutions. The λmax of PBTHTQ, 
PTTHTQ, PFBTHTQ, and PPBTHTP solid films are shown at 780, 876, 734, and 710 nm, 
respectively. The optical band gaps (Egopt) of the above polymers estimated from absorption edge 
are 1.31, 1.05, 1.40, and 1.43 eV, respectively. The optical band gap of PFBTHTQ is close to 
that of a similar polymer (with different side chain on the TQ and no side chain on the thiophene 
moiety) reported in the literature. The trend on the λmax between the four copolymers is the same 
as those of solution. The red-shifted λmax of the solid films compared to the corresponding 
solution spectra is probably attributed to the π-π stacking of the polymer chains in the former. 
The much lower band gaps of the above BTHTQ based copolymers than that of the parent 
polythiophene (PTH, 2.0eV), poly(9,9-octylfluorene) (PF, 2.95eV), and poly(p-phenylene) 
(PPP, 2.7eV) homopolymers further suggest the significance of intramolecular charge transfer 
between donor and [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline acceptor. 
 
Electrochemical Properties 
The oxidation and reduction potentials of these polymers were investigated by cyclic 
voltammetry. Figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms (CV) diagrams of PBTHTQ, PTTHTQ, 
PFBTHTQ, and PPBTHTP and the corresponding electrochemical properties are listed in Table 
1. All the copolymers exhibit reversible oxidation but not in the case of reduction. The HOMO 
levels of the three studied polymers estimated from the onset of the oxidation peaks are in the 
range of -4.84 ~ -5.20 eV. The LUMO levels of PBTHTQ, PTTHTQ, PFBTHTQ, and 
PPBTHTQ estimated from the onset of the reduction peaks are -3.75, -3.63, -3.66, and -3.63 eV, 
respectively. The HOMO levels of the BTHTQ based copolymers are similar to that of the 
 10
chloroform (bp: 61 0C) provided a sufficient time to form ordered polymer structures. The 
relatively small surface roughness (root mean square (RMS) roughness around 0.385~0.573 nm) 
of PFBTHTQ and PBTHTQ results in the lower mobility than that of similar polymer structure 
with different side chain reported in the literature since that has a liquid-crystalline morphology. 
However, a larger needle-like structure (Figure 5(b)) is observed for the PTTHTQ. In 
comparison of aforementioned morphology from CHCl3, PTTHTP films cast from CB solution 
formed a larger domain and thus reduced the boundary to stabilize the channel, which led to the 
enhanced hole mobility. Also, the formation of microcrystalline domain on enhancing the FET 
mobility has been demonstrated in several literature reports. The above results suggest the 
importance of both intramolecular charge transfer and morphology on the charge transporting 
characteristics.  
 
4.2. Effects of acceptors on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of new 
didecyloxyphenylene–acceptor alternating conjugated copolymers 
 
Poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) is a blue emitter with large band gap and its electronic 
optoelectronic properties could be easily modified through side chains or copolymers.  
Introduction of long dialkoxy chains into the phenylene not only makes these materials more 
soluble but also increases the p-type strength. Recently, the synthesis and characterization of 
dialkoxyphenylene-acceptor conjugated copolymers have been reported. 
Dialkoxyphenylene-pyridine copolymers exhibited efficient blue emission and their 
photophysical properties could be controlled by protonation/intramolecular hydrogen 
bondingand metal ion.  However, the effects of acceptor strengths on the electronic and 
optoelectronic properties of soluble dialkoxyphenylene-acceptor and donor-acceptor-donor 
copolymers have not been fully explored yet, especially the field-effect charge transport and 
photovoltaic properties. 
In this paper, we report the synthesis and properties of seven didecyloxyphenylene -acceptor 
or thiophene-acceptor-thiophene copolymers shown in Scheme 2. These donor-acceptor 
conjugated polymers were synthesized by Suzuki coupling reaction of 
2,5-didecyloxy-1,4-phenylene-1,4-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolate) (DP) with the 
dibromo-acceptors. The acceptors include  thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 
(BT) quinoxaline (Q), pyridine(Py), 2,3-dimethyl-5,7-dithien-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine(DTTP), 
and 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT), and 2,3–dimethyl-5,7–dithien-2–yl- 
quinoxaline] (DTQ). The properties of these D-A copolymers could be compared those of the 
parent didecyloxyphenylene-phenylene polymer (DP/P, 1 in Scheme 2). 
The normalized optical absorption of copolymers in dilute chloroform solution (10-5 M) and 
thin films are shown in Figures 6, and the corresponding absorption properties are collected in 
Table 3. The absorption maxima (λmax) of polymers, DP/P(1), DP/TP(2a), DP/BT(2b), 
 12
2c and 2d are at -5.43~-5.45 eV, which are very similar to that of polymer 1. However, the 
LUMO levels of the polymers 2a-2d are in the range of -2.55~-3.38 eV which is lower-lying 
than that of polymer 1. The particular high-lying HOMO level (-4.61 eV) and low-lying LUMO 
level (-3.38 eV) of polymer 2a are due to the coplanar polymer structures of the TP moiety. It 
also demonstrates the more efficient intramolecular charge transfer of polymer 2a than the other 
three copolymers. Besides, polymer 2b shows a lower-lying LUMO energy than polymer 2c and 
2d since BT has the strongest π-electron accepting ability. The electrochemical band gaps of 
polymers 2a-2d are in the range of 1.23-2.90 eV, which are significantly lower than that of 
polymer 1 with 3.15 eV. The destabilization of HOMO and stabilization of LUMO level result in 
reduced band gaps, which also demonstrates the significance of intramolecular charge transfer 
through the donor-acceptor structures. Although there is deviation between the optical and 
electrochemical band gaps (0.2~0.8 eV), the trend between the band gap and polymer structure is 
similar. Polymer 3a shows a similar HOMO level but a slighter higher LUMO level (Figure 7(c)) 
and electrochemical band gap than polymer 2a, which could be explained by the less 
intramolecular charge transfer. Polymers 3b, and 3c, exhibit more higher-lying HOMO than 2b 
and 2c, respectively, indicating that the coplanarity of the polymer backbone is improved by 
incorporating the thiophene moiety.  
 
Field Effect Transistor Characteristics.  
The bottom contact FET devices based on the synthesized didecyloxyphenylene-acceptor 
conjugated copolymers were fabricated on a Si/SiO2 substrate by spin coating. Only polymers 2a, 
3a, 3b, and 3c device could show typical p-channel transfer characteristics (drain current (Id) 
versus drain voltage (Vd) at various gate voltage (Vg)), as shown in Figure 8 and 9. Field-effect 
mobilities of the studied conjugated polymers were estimated by equation (1) and Figures 8 and 
9. The estimated hole mobilities of polymers 2a, 3a, 3b, and 3c are 1.89 × 10-3, 1.41×10-5, 
1.92×10-4, and 2.1×10-3 cm2V-1s-1, respectively, with the corresponding on/off current ratios of 82, 
36, 604, and 3.6×103 in ambient conditions. Although the obtained hole mobility is not as high as 
that of poly(3-hexylthiophene), it is comparable to the reported other classes of donor-acceptor 
conjugated polymers. The high mobility (10-2 ~10-1 cm2V-1s-1) of poly(3-hexylthiophene) is due 
to the regioregular polymer structure and resulted self-organized morphology. However, the 
synthesized DP-acceptor or DP-thiophene-acceptor-thiophene conjugated polymers do not have 
such regioregular polymer structure to obtain a similar mobility as P3HT. Also, the differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves on all of the copolymers did not detect any clear phase 
transition. The root mean square roughness (RMS) of polymer films from the AFM are relatively 
low for the above four polymers, as shown in Table 3. It suggests the amorphorous characteristic 
of the synthesized polymers and the difference on the mobilities of the above polymers is most 
likely due to the polymer structures. Nevertheless, it would be of interest to discuss the effect of 
donor/acceptor strength and backbone planarity on the charge carrier mobility. 
 14
much enhanced device performance was found using the other two polymers: polymer 3b/PCBM 
(1.67 mA/cm2(Jsc), 0.61 V(Voc), 0.40(FF), and 0.41% PCE; polymer 3c/PCBM( 1.55 
mA/cm2(Jsc), 0.52 V(Voc), 0.49(FF), and 0.40% PCE. 
Voc is approximately as a measure of the difference between the oxidation potential of the 
donor (polymers 2a, 3b and 3c) and the reduction potential of the acceptor (PCBM). Thus, the 
raising HOMO of polymer 2a, closer to the LUMO of PCBM, diminishes the value of Voc (0.27 
V) while the Voc of polymer 3b/PCBM (0.61 V) and polymer 3c/PCBM (0.52 V) shows a larger 
value. Furthermore, the Jsc of polymer 2a/PCBM is lower than those of polymer 3b or 3c/PCBM. 
It might arise from the small energy difference (0.32 eV) between the LUMO levels of polymer 
2a (3.38 eV) and PCBM (3.7 eV) and lead to insufficient electron-hole charge separation. 
Therefore, polymer 2a/PCBM shows a much lower power conversion efficiency than the others.  
The highest power conversion efficiency for the polymers is around 0.41%, which is one 
order of magnitude smaller than that of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/PCBM based devices. 
As described in the literature, small band gap, self-organized structure, and high carrier mobility 
are essential for obtaining high power conversion efficiency in bulk heterojunction solar cells. 
Based on the above criteria, the amorphorous characteristic of polymers 2 and 3 probably 
account for the observed low efficiency. However, their tunable electronic properties provide an 
understanding on how the polymer structures affect the device characteristics. Further 
optimization on the solar cell structure (such as different blend ratios, film thickness, or electrode 
materials) or processing conditions (such as annealing temperature) could lead to enhanced 
efficiency of photovoltaic cells. 
 
4.3. Photophysical, thin film transistor, and solar cell characteristics of Qx(EHP)-based 
conjugated polymers. 
 
Among D-A conjugated copolymers, the electron-donating moieties of fluorene, thiophene, 
dialkoxylphenylene, and carbazole have been reported. On the other hand, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine 
(TP), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), quinoxaline (Q), and pyridine (Py) are generally employed as 
the electron-accepting moieties.  We are particular interested in the quinoxaline based 
copolymers due to their good charge-transfer characteristics and stability for device applications. 
We found that poly(thiophene-alt-alkylquinoxaline) based thin film transistor exhibited a medium 
high hole mobility with a relatively high on/off ratio and ambipolar carrier transport by blending 
with poly(benzobisimidazophenanthroline). A recent report by Ingänas’s group demonstrated that 
fluorene-quinoxaline alternating copolymer exhibited a high power conversion photovoltaic 
efficiency due to its balanced electron and hole mobilities. Another study by Scherf’s group 
discovered the quinoxaline/ologothiophene copolymers having the unexpected independence of 
photophysical properties with the thiophene segment length. We believe that the intramolecular 
charge transfer and backbone planarity played important roles on the above results.  
 16
respectively, while those in solid films are 740, 742, 702 and (636, 658) nm. The large shifts of 
the λmaxPL in the solid films compared with their solutions suggest extensive polymer interaction 
and enhanced intramolecular energy transfer in the above polymer films, thus leading to different 
energy transfer.  
 
Electrochemical Characteristics  
The electrochemical characteristics of the four copolymers were investigated by cyclic 
voltammetry and summarized in Table 4. Figure 13 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the four 
polymer films. All of the prepared copolymers exhibit quasi -reversible reductive reaction but 
only PFODTQ(EHP) has a reversible oxidation. The LUMO levels of PThQx(EHP) and 
PDTQ(EHP) estimated from the onset reduction are -3.10 eV, with the HOMO potentials 
estimated from the onset oxidation in the range of -5.02 ~ -5.03 eV. It suggests that the 
HOMO/LUMO levels of the two polymers do not change significantly even though the 
thiophene content varies. Furthermore, the electrochemical band gaps of PThQx(EHP) and 
PDTQ(EHP) estimated from cyclic voltammetry (1.92 vs. 1.93 eV) are very close. The LUMO 
levels of POC10DTQ(EHP) and PFODTQ(EHP) are -2.96 and -3.30 eV, respectively, with 
their HOMO levels are -4.98 and -5.38 eV. In comparison with the HOMO and LUMO levels of 
poly(9,9-octylfluorene) (PFO) at -5.6 and -2.0 eV, the energy levels of PFODTQ(EHP) have 
been significantly varied due to the modulated ICT strength. The electrochemical band gaps are 
0.2 ~ 0.4 eV larger than the corresponding optical ones, which is probably due to the exciton 
binding energy of conjugated polymers. However, the trend between the polymer structure and 
the obtained band gap is similar. 
 
Thin Film Transistor Characteristics  
The charge transporting characteristics of the four polymers were explored by their bottom 
contact thin film transistor (TFT) devices and summarized in Table 5. Figure 14 shows the TFT 
characteristic curves of all four copolymers on the OTS-modified SiO2. These polymers showed 
typical p-type I-V characteristics (drain current Id vs drain voltage Vd at different gate voltages 
Vg) when operated in the accumulation mode operation. In the saturation region (Vd > Vg – Vt ), 
Id can be described by Eq.(1):

Here, W and L are the channel width and length, respectively. Co is the capacitance of the gate 
insulator per unit area (SiO2, 200nm, Co= 17 nF/cm2). The saturation region mobility of the 
studied polymers was calculated from the transfer characteristics involving plotting (Id)1/2 versus 
Vg. The estimated hole mobilities of PThQx(EHP) and PDTQ(EHP) are 2.52×10-4 and 
4.50×10-3 cm2V-1s-1, respectively, with the corresponding on-off ratios of 2.00×104 and 1.89×103 
in the ambient conditions. Both of them possess similar threshold voltage (VT) around -17 V, but 
 18
relatively low HOMO energy level (-5.14 eV) of PFODTQ(EHP) compared with the other 
copolymers (ca -4.8 eV). Voc is an approximate measure of the difference between the oxidation 
potentials of the donor polymer and the reduction potential of PCBM. Furthermore, the good 
film quality (due to high Mw) and medium high hole mobility are probably contributed to good 
short-circuit current (Isc) of PFODTQ(EHP). The photocurrent increased at a higher PCBM 
loading provides the formation of adequate electron and hole percolation paths and leads to 
efficient charge collection to the electrodes. The PCE of PFODTQ(EHP) device reaches 1.75 % 
based on the above optimization. Although the PCE of PFODTQ(EHP) is lower than that of 
similar polymer with 3.5%, it could be improved through device optimization. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
The optoelectronic and device characteristics of BTHTQ-based, DP-based, and 
Qx(EHP)-based alternating copolymers were investigated. Four new BTHTQ-based 
donor-acceptor conjugated copolymers were successfully synthesized using Stille or Suzuki 
coupling reaction. The optical band gaps of PBTHTQ, PTTHTQ, PFBTHTQ, and PPBTHTQ 
were 1.31, 1.05, 1.40, and 1.43 eV, suggesting the significance of intramolecular charge transfer.  
The electrochemical band gap also shows a similar trend. Also, high p-channel carrier mobility 
up to 3.8×10-3 cm2V-1s-1 was obtained for the PTTHTQ-based FET devices The higher hole 
mobility of PTTHTQ than the other two copolymers was attributed from its smaller band gap 
due to large intramolecular charge transfer or wormlike (chloroform) or needle-like 
(chlorobenzene) ordered morphology. The characteristics of small band gap and high mobility 
suggest the potential applications of the TQ based conjugated copolymers in electronic and 
optoelectronic devices. 
Furthermore, seven soluble DP-acceptor or –thiophene–acceptor-thiophene copolymers 
were successfully synthesized by Suzuki coupling polymerization. The electronic, 
electrochemical, and optoelectronic properties significantly varied with acceptor strength and 
backbone planarity of the D-A copolymers. The copolymers showed a wide range of optical 
band gaps of 1.47-3.15 eV through the variation of acceptors. The field-effect mobility of holes 
varied from 1.4x10-5 cm2V-1s-1 in DP/DTTP to 2.10×10-3 cm2V-1s-1 in DP/DTQ. The observed 
much higher carrier mobilities in DP/DTBT and DP/DTQ copolymers than those of DP/BT and 
DP/Q is probably due to the improved backbone planarity of the latter. A power conversion 
efficiency around 0.4% was achieved from the photovoltaic cells fabricated from some of these 
polymers blended with PCBM. The present study demonstrates that the electronic and optical 
properties of dialkoxylphenylene-based donor-acceptor copolymers could be easily manipulated 
through the acceptor strength and backbone coplanarity. 
In the last section, we have successfully synthesized four Qx(EHP)-based donor-acceptor 
copolymers for thin film transistor (TFT) and solar cell applications. PThQx(EHP) has the

的幾個部份： 
(1) 中國教授: Prof. Tong, Hui (Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, CAS, Changchun, China)，講
題為 Novel High Photoluminescence Quantum Yield Water-Soluble Dendronized Polyfluorenes for 
Hg(II) Sensing，此研究團隊，成功開發出可水溶性之感測離子的樹狀型高分子材料，藉由特殊
官能基的螯合機制，可以相當敏感地偵測到幾種金屬離子:Hg(2價)離子等，其發光效能可以達

出席國際會議報告(由蔡榮訓、闕居振及郭霽慶三位博士生使用本經費出國) 
(1) 蔡榮訓出席 Polycondensation 2008(Sep. 08-11, 2008, Tokyo, Japan)國際會議報告 
 
一、參加會議經過 
    學生有幸此次參與由日本高分子學會等知名國際單位贊助東京工業大學所主辦的
「Polycondensation 2008」，此會議為國際上相當知名的高分子聯合會議。自 1996 年在巴黎舉辦開
始，為每兩年舉辦一次的國際會議，迄今已邁入第七屆，參加者主要來自美國、歐洲、俄羅斯、日
本、韓國、台灣、大陸及其他地區國家的學術單位及相關業者，在探討高分子縮合聚合方面具有相
當高的重要性。在參與此次會議中，總共有兩場專題演講、四十三場邀請演講和六十五篇壁報論文
張貼發表。其中安排了多位國際知名學者如 Timothy E. Long 和 M. Ree 教授等人發表演說，並且發
現亦有國內各大學的學者受到邀請口頭報告，而在壁報展覽會場中，也有許多國內研究成果發表，
顯示我國在高分子相關領域的研究實力。與會中大多探討縮聚合高分子的應用和其所表現的物理與
化學性質，而更多著重於新穎材料的開發(如樹枝狀與刷狀高分子)。而因為環保意識的抬頭，今年
會議更增加了高分子光電元件應用(如:太陽能電池)方面的討論。 
    與會當中，學生也有聽了數場演說，包含電致色變材料、刷狀與樹枝狀高分子材料、質子傳導
膜應用於燃料電池，以及低膨脹係數材料應用於軟板印刷基材等主題探討。而這些主題，對於學生
日後在高分子材料的合成設計研究上會有很大的幫助。 
 
二、與會心得 
這次參與 Polycondensation 2008 會議不但對於聚縮合成領域方面有了更深一層的了解，同時也
看到未來研究發展之趨勢。而我所發表的壁報論文題目為“Synthesis of New 
Indolocarbazole-Acceptor Conjugated Copolymers and Their Thin Film Transistor and Solar Cell 
Applications＂。這也是在 Poster session 中，唯一一篇探討太陽能電池的論文，所以格外引人注目。
藉由與許多不同領域研究先進的討論與他們給我的建議，讓我對於自已的研究內容有了新的想法與
改良的空間，並且讓自已學習如何清楚表達自已的研究，我想這是此次會議最大的收獲。 
另一方面，在這次會議之餘也與東工大 M. Udea 教授實驗室進行交流，不但參觀其合成、元件
實驗室，也與 Professor T. Higashihara 有深入的討論。Professor T. Higashihara 致力於以 P3HT 為基
礎，所合成出的 triblock-copolymer 材料開發，藉由與他的討論，讓我了解此材料開發的關鍵點，
與期待應用於太陽能電池上的展望 (Poster 編號 P44)。 此外，因為實驗室有榮幸與 Professor A. 
Hirao 合作，所以也參觀此實驗室的”陰離子聚合”設備，也算是讓自已開了眼界。 
而學生有此榮幸參加此會議，要特別感謝學校和國科會國合處在經費上的補助。培育國內研究
生出國，除了提昇國際觀外，亦可以增進國際交流，此次研討會實為收穫匪淺。

一、參加會議經過 
    此「Polycondensation 2008」會議自 1996 年開始，為每兩年舉辦一次的國際會議，迄今已邁
入第七屆，參加者主要來自美國、歐洲、俄羅斯、日本、韓國、台灣、大陸及其他地區國家的學術
單位及相關業者，在探討高分子縮合聚合方面具有相當高的重要性。本屆會議主要由日本東京工業
大學主辦，由日本高分子學會等知名國際單位贊助於日本東京工業大學舉行，時間從九月八日至九
月十一日，為期四天。總共有兩場專題演講與四十餘場邀請演講，其中安排了多位國際知名學者如
M. H. Ree 教授等人發表演說；總共六十五篇壁報論文張貼發表。會中除了探討化學、物理性質外，
也討論由縮合高分子的應用來幫助解答材料的利用和其所產生的問題，此外今年會議更增加了高分
子光電元件應用方面的討論。 
    此次會議我所發表的壁報論文題目為“Synthesis of New Acceptor-Vinylene/Ethynylene 
Alternating Copolymers and their Thin Film Transistor Characteristics. ＂，時間被安排在會議第一天下
午。由於高分子光電元件為本次會議所新增之議題，有許多教授與其他國家的學生和我進行討論交
流。文獻中甚少關於雙鍵與三鍵共聚物再元件應用方面的討論。當雙鍵與三鍵導入高分子主鏈，由
於其良好的電子共振程度以及極佳的共平面性，使高分子 UV-Vis 吸收光譜上會有顯著的紅移和遠
紅外光譜的吸收，具有甚小的能隙，且在 Bottom Gate/Bottm Contact 之電晶體測試中，發現雙鍵衍
生物更具有相當高的電洞遷徙特性，然而三鍵衍生物的電洞遷徙特性並沒有預期中比雙鍵的好，這
主要是因為三鍵所具有的共平面性沒有比雙鍵來的好，這可從文獻中的理論計算中所得證明。與會
當中，學生也有聽了數場演說，包含電致色變材料、發光材料、質子傳導膜應用於燃料電池，以及
低膨脹係數材料應用於軟板印刷基材等主題探討。亦包含樹枝狀高分子之合成實驗與分子量分布理
論探討。對於未來的研究有相當大的幫助。 
 
二、與會心得 
這次參予 Polycondensation 2008 會議可說是獲益匪淺，不但對於縮合合成領域方面有了更深一層的
了解，同時也看到未來研究發展之趨勢。此外在這次會議之餘也與東工大 M. Udea 教授實驗室進行
交流，不但參觀其合成實驗室，也與其實驗室成員相談甚歡，奠定了往後彼此雙方進行實驗上合作
交流的基礎。因此，學生對於能夠有機會參加此盛會，內心感到相當相當榮幸與驕傲。最後要特別
感謝學校和國科會國合處在經費上的補助。培育國內研究生出國，除了提昇國際觀外，亦可以增進
國際交流，期望將來可以替國家爭光。
