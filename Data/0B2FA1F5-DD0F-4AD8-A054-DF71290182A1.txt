Abstract 
 
 A small amount of zirconia particles (! 5 
vol.%) is added into alumina in the present study. 
The grain size of alumina is reduced; the strength of 
alumina is therefore enhanced. Though the 
theoretical analysis demonstrates that an addition of 
1 vol.% of fine zirconia particles is sufficient to 
prohibit the coarsening of alumina grains; the 
experimental measurements indicate that a minimum 
amount of 2 vol.% is required to reduce the 
coarsening of alumina matrix and its size distribution.  
This discrepancy is due to the separation between the 
zirconia particles and alumina grain boundaries, 
which takes place when the alumina grain size 
increases above a critical value.

1. Introduction 
 
Ceramics are brittle in nature. Such 
brittleness limits many applications involving using 
ceramics as engineering components. To improve the 
toughness of ceramics, there has been much work in 
the last several decades. Since an increase of strength 
also improves the possibility of brittle ceramics to 
survive external impacts, increasing the strength of 
ceramic is also an important task.  
 Several relationships have been derived to 
describe the strength, ", of brittle ceramics [1,2]. 
One relationship is that proposed by Griffith,  
 
! 
" =
K
IC
Y C
   (1) 
In the above equation, KIC is the toughness, Y a 
geometrical constant, and C the flaw size. The above 
relationship demonstrates that the strength of a 
ceramic depends strongly on its flaw size and grain 
size.  
 The reduction of flaw size can be achieved 
by controlling each processing step carefully [3]. The 
decrease of grain size can be reached through the 
addition of second phase particles [4-8]. The 
inhibitors can be oxides [5], or non-oxides [4,6] or 
metallic particles [7,8]. These particles should be 
relatively inert to the ceramic matrix during sintering 
at elevated temperature. Among the composite 
systems investigated, alumina-zirconia systems have 
attracted wide attention. The solubility between 
alumina and zirconia is low (2000 ppm at 1450°C 
[9]), and the engineering potential of the composites 
is high. In the present study, the alumina-zirconia 
system is also used as a model system to explore the 
rule of microstructure design for strength 
enhancement.  
The first study on the Al2O3-ZrO2 system 
employed a minimum amount of 2 vol.% ZrO2 
particles to enhance the toughness of Al2O3 [5]. The 
study demonstrated that the toughness of Al2O3 
could be enhanced only when the ZrO2 content was 
higher than 5 vol.%. Many studies were then 
performed to confirm this approach [10-14]. Most 
studies have added more than 5 vol.% ZrO2 into 
Al2O3. They have demonstrated that both the 
toughness and strength of alumina are improved; 
nevertheless, the sinterability of the ceramic matrix is 
reduced when a large amount of second phase is 
added [15]. Furthermore, the cost of the composites 
is also increased.  
In order to cope with the drop of sintering 
activity and the increase of cost, a small amount, < 5 
vol.%, of second phase is therefore of interest. Such 
an approach has received little attention in previous 
studies. One limited study indicated that the 
properties were not improved by using a small 
amount, < 5 vol.%, of particles [5]. The dilemma on 
designing ceramic matrix composite is thus apparent. 
On the one hand, as the second phase content is low, 
the sintering activity is little affected. But the 
properties improvement is suspected to be also small 
(it will be demonstrated that this may not be the 
case). On the other hand, when the second phase 
content is high, the mechanical properties are 
improved. However, the cost increase associated with 
the material hinders the application potential of the 
composites.  
In the present study, a small amount of 
ZrO2 particles, !5vol.%, is added into Al2O3. The 
microstructure of the composites is carefully 
investigated. The minimum required amount of 
second phase is suggested in terms of achieving 
strength enhancement.  
 
2. Experimental  
 
 An alumina (TM-DR, d50 = 140 nm, 
Taimei Chem. Co. Ltd., Nagno-ken, Japan) powder 
was ball milled together with 0-5 vol.% zirconia 
powder (TZ-3Y, ZrO2 + 3 mol.% Y2O3, d50 = 230 
nm, Tosoh Co., Japan) in ethyl alcohol for 24 hours, 
using 10mm diameter zirconia balls as grinding 
media. The slurry of the powder mixtures was dried 
with a rotary evaporator, and then the dried lumps 
alumina) to 2.2 µm (for Al2O3/5%ZrO2 composite). 
Except the Al2O3/1%ZrO2 composite, the size scatter 
of the Al2O3 grains in the composites is also reduced.  
Most ZrO2 particles are well separated 
within the Al2O3 matrix. Since the coarsening of 
ZrO2 particles can then take place only through the 
diffusion within the Al2O3 matrix, this is a relatively 
slow process. Therefore, the size of zirconia particles 
is more or less the same in all the Al2O3/ZrO2 
composites, indicating that the coarsening of well-
dispersed ZrO2 inclusions is limited. Such limited 
coarsening can be related to the low ZrO2 content 
used in the present study. The coarsening of ZrO2 
particles is found only in the ZrO2 agglomerate (see 
Fig. 4e).  
For a composite containing mono-sized 
inclusions, the grain size decreases with the increase 
of particle content (Zener effect). The nearest neighbor 
distance (or mean free path), $, between randomly 
distributed particles can be estimated with the 
following relationship proposed by Westmacott et al. 
[18] and Kock [19],  
  
! 
" = (
#

)

d
F

  (3) 
where d is the size of particle and F the volume 
fraction. The calculated values for the distance 
between nearest neighboring ZrO2 particles in Al2O3 
matrix are shown in Table 1. The Table indicates 
that the mean free path between the ZrO2 particles in 
all the Al2O3/ZrO2 composites is shorter than the 
corresponding size of the Al2O3 grains.  
It is thus of interest to estimate the 
minimum amount of second phase particles needed 
to prohibit the growth of matrix grains. By assuming 
that one particle is enough to prohibit the movement 
of one grain boundary, then ! ~ G (G=size of matrix 
grains). The amount of particle needed to prohibit 
the growth of matrix grains can be estimated by re-
arranging Eq. (3) as, 
  
!

G
  (4)  
For the microstructure shown in Fig. 9(a), 
each grain boundary of matrix grains (white grains) is 
pinned by one particle (dark particle). As the size of 
particle is the same as that of matrix grains, the 
particle content is around 50 vol.%. Though the 
microstructure should be stable throughout the 
sintering process, such high particle content can not 
only prohibit the grain growth but also limit the 
sintering activity of the ceramic matrix grains. 
Therefore, the amount of the second phase should be 
lower than 50 vol.%.  
As the particle size is reduced to one tenth 
that of matrix grains, Fig. 9(b), a volume fraction of 
0.5 vol.% is obtained by using Eq. (4). If the 
! 
d
G
 
ratio is further decreased to 0.01, the amount of 
second phase can then be reduced to 0.005 vol.%. 
The analysis implies that the amount of 1 vol.% 
particle may be more than enough to prohibit the 
grain growth of Al2O3 matrix. However, as the 
! 
d
G
 
value is too low, it may encourage the separation of 
the particle and grain boundary, as demonstrated in 
the Al2O3/1vo.%ZrO2 composite (see Fig. 4b). In the 
composite, most ZrO2 particles are separated from the 
grain boundaries of Al2O3 grains. The ZrO2 particles 
with such low amount can no longer prohibit the 
growth of matrix grains; several coarse grains are 
thus survived after sintering (see Fig. 5). In order to 
prohibit the movement of grain boundary, the 
particle is preferably located at the grain boundary as 
the case shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b). The case as 
demonstrated in Fig. 9(c) should be avoided. 
Therefore, the criteria for the separation of secondary 
particles and grain boundary should be investigated.  
During sintering, with the help of a number 
of transport mechanisms the matrix grains can grow 
with the help from the movement of grain boundary. 
The velocity of the grain boundary movement is 
virtually the same as the grain growth rate. As the 
velocity of grain boundary, vb, is much higher than 
that of particle, vp, the separation can take place (see 
Fig. 10). The following relationship defines the 
criteria for the separation to take place  
! 
vb > vp
max
   (5) 
In order for the particle and grain boundary 
to move, the velocity is contributed by mobility, M, 
and force, F, as  
! 
v = MF  (6) 
For the grain boundary, its mobility is 
controlled by the diffusion across the grain boundary, 
D
*
, the Boltzmann’s constant, k, and the absolute 
temperature, T. The force on the grain boundary is 
controlled by the grain boundary energy, "gb, and 
grain size, G. The velocity of boundary, vb, can then 
be expressed as [20],  
! 
vb = MbFb =
D
*
kT
" gb
G
  (7) 
For the particle, mass can transport along 
the interface or the interior of the particle or both. 
Therefore, an effective diffusion coefficient, Deff, to 
illustrate the mobility of the particle is used instead 
as [20],  
! 
Mp =
Deff"
kTd
n
    (8) 
where # is the volume of controlling ions, n a 
constant depending on the mechanism. The force on 
the particle is also provided by the grain boundary 
energy. By using the relationship to estimate the 
force on an isolated pore [20], the force on a particle 
is estimated as  
 
! 
Fp = 2"d# gb    (9)

此系列之國際會議每兩年辦一次, 前幾次多在亞洲舉行, 此次到英國舉行, 
竟吸引全世界相關學者熱情參與, 皆出乎與會者預期. 因此次在英國舉辦, 許多
歐洲學者參與, 筆者發現歐洲仍有非常多的學者在做非常紮實的基礎研究, 因電
子陶瓷受結構的影響極大, 此方面研究歐洲學者做的非常好, 歐洲雖缺民生電子
工業, 但在工業電子產品方面仍居主導地位. 而歐洲紮實的基礎研究正是這些基
礎工業繼續領先的推動力.  
 
 要辦一個成功的國際會議, 須極多人力及經費的投入, 此次雖由Manchester 
大學的Prof. Freer主辦, 但學校投入許多資源支持, 連Manchester市政府皆由市長出

 第十屆 陶瓷製程科學國際研討會議  
 
10th International Conference on Ceramic Processing Science 
(ICCPS-10)  
Inuyama, Aichi, JAPAN  
May 25-28, 2008 
 
I. 前言：  
 
陶瓷製程科學國際研討會議(10th International Conference on Ceramic 
Processing Science,ICCPS-10 )為日本名古屋大學所主辦之國際陶瓷研討會
議。 
會議從5月25日開始至5月28日在愛知線的犬山市舉行。此次會議並獲得國
際間備受尊崇的陶瓷協會(The ceramic society of Japan、The American 
ceramic society 、The European ceramic society )背書，是非常難能可貴的
機會。 
 
此會議在犬山市區的一個活動中心 (Inuyama International 
Sightseeing Center)舉行， 因為犬山市並非屬於日本的大都市，而是位於
鄰近日本著名大城市名古屋的鄉間，所以相關的硬體設備顯得較不夠完善
而活動場地也較為狹小。但也見識到了日本人對細節的注重以及應對的禮
貌。 
 
會議分為口頭報告及海報展示，此次計有27個國家參加，共有104篇
口頭報告以及134篇海報展示。口頭報告分別在三個會議室同步舉行，而海
報展示則分批在兩天的下午展出，並在傍晚時分有一個半小時左右的時
     學生將此次與會印象較為深刻的演講簡單扼要說明於後： 
 
1. 第一場由日本 Tokyo Institute of Technol(東京工業大學 )的M. 
Yoshimura 教授以”Powder – Less Processing for Nano-Structured 
FunctionalCeramics: Realization of Direct Fabrication from Solutions and 
/ or Melts” 為題發表演講，Yoshimura 教授指出基於能量耗損的考量
之下，對於有形狀需求的陶瓷而言，Solution processing 所需要的能
量損耗是最低的，而”Soft processing ”或”Soft solution processing”是指
在溶液中，藉由固態基底和反應物進行介面反應。他們目前已經成功
地製造出CaWO4、BaWO4、TiO2和CeO2 薄膜。 
 
2. 第二場由日本九州大學的  J. Hojo 教授發表，他的題目為 
“Hydrothermal Synthesis of TiO2 and BaTiO3 Nanoparticles under 
Microwave Irradiation” ，在他們的研究中顯示利用微波輻射在合成氧
化物粉末的時候會有一些有趣的現象，例如：促進晶體成長，較小的
粉末顆粒、甚至改變組成的晶相…等等。並以藉由加熱TiOCl2水溶液
來獲得TiO2 的結晶為例，以傳統製程所獲得之TiO2 為針狀之金紅石
結晶相；而以微波輻射加熱所得到的則為50nm左右之銳鈦礦結晶相。 
 
3. 第三場由德國Fraunhofer-Institut für Silicate Research ISC的.F. Raether
以”Current Sate of in situ Measuring Methods for the control of Sintering 
Processes ” 為題發表演講，圖1為TOM (thermooptical method )儀器，
圖2為儀器設計，透過TOM亦即光熱法，不管試樣的尺寸、管型爐、
箱型爐、燒結氣氛（氧化、還原、真空、真空…等等）都可以透過非
接觸法來監測在燒結過程中試樣的尺寸或重量的變化。而且亦可以進
一步地研究一些現象，例如：熱傳導、翹、塑性變形、結塊、潤濕以
及裂縫等等。 
 
 這次所參加的海報展示其格式為橫式的設計，雖然有不少海報仍誤
設計為常見之直式，但學生覺得橫式的設計就如同現在液晶螢幕所主流的
寬螢幕形式，較為符合人體工學設計，一眼望去即可看到全部的海報內
容，學生覺得這是個不錯海報展示方式。
