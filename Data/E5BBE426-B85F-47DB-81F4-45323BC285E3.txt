Abstract 
The semiconductor manufacturing 
industry is one of the largest industries in the 
world, with annual revenues exceeding US 
$200 Billion. The semiconductor 
manufacturers announced the new 
investment plans to develop and construct 
300-mm wafer fabs successively. It is 
estimated that more than twenty 300-mm 
wafer fabs will be complete in a few years. 
Predictably in the near future, Taiwan 
semiconductor industries will move from 
producing 200-mm wafer era to 300-mm era. 
The standard unit of lot transfer between 
tools in a 300-mm fab is the front-opening 
unified pod (FOUP). FOUPs are containers 
that hold a 25-wafer (or 13-wafer) lot of 
300-mm wafers in an inert, nitrogen 
atmosphere. In addition, the processing time 
of some operations is the same regardless of 
the number of wafers in the FOUP (lot 
processing). Thus, 300-mm semiconductor 
manufacturers often have the need to group 
orders from different customers into one 
FOUP. Once multiple orders are grouped

To date, there is only one article to 
discuss the multi-stage MOJ scheduling 
problem. Laub et al. [1] studied the 
two-machine flow-shop MOJ scheduling 
problems with the lot and item processing 
machine to minimize the makespan. An 
optimization model was presented that 
addressed both job formation and job 
sequencing. They also designed an efficient 
heuristic to solve the problem. This study 
investigates the two different multi-stage 
MOJ problems, including flow-shop MOJ 
scheduling problems and job-shop MOJ 
scheduling problems.  
Laub et al. [1] focus on the one-stage, 
single product type and ignored the ready 
times and setup times. This study deals with 
two different multi-stage scheduling 
problems with the considerations of multiple 
orders per job, the ready times of all orders, 
multiple product types, and the 
sequence-dependent setup times between the 
product types. Both the lot processing 
machine and item processing machine are 
also examined. This study also presents 
eight mixed BIP formulations for two 
different multi-stage scheduling problems. 
The criterion considered is minimizing the 
total completion time. 
 
 
Problem description 
 
This study addresses the scheduling of N 
independent orders on the flow-shop and 
job-shop while taking into account multiple 
orders per job, the ready times of all orders, 
multiple product types, and the 
sequence-dependent setup times between the 
product types.  
Figure 1 illustrates the representation of a 
schedule involving multiple product types 
MOJ on a flow-shop with two machines. 
The six orders include O1, O2, …, and O6, 
while the two product types include c and 
d. There are four FOUPs and thus the six 
orders are formed into four jobs, including 
J1, J2, J3, and J4, where J1 = {O1, O3}, J2 = 
{O2}, J3 = {O4, O6}, and J4 = {O5}. These 
four jobs are going to be processed on a 
flow-shop with two machines, including M1 
and M2. Each job has to be processed on M1 
and then M2. Moreover, πk denotes the job 
sequence on Mk. We obtain a feasible 
schedule (π1, π2), where π1 = (J2, J1, J4, J3) 
and π2 = (J1, J2, J3, J4). The decisions being 
considered then include: (i) the number of 
jobs that are grouped in each order, (ii) how 
to group the orders together, and (iii) how to 
schedule the jobs to minimize total weighted 
completion time. Consequently, this 
problem possesses three characteristics: (i) 
multiple orders may be assembled in one job, 
(ii) the job size lies in the FOUP’s space, 
and (iii) the orders placed in the same job 
own the same completion time. 
 
  
 
Figure 1. An illustrative example for the 
flow-shop MOJ scheduling problem 
 
Two types of processing cases—lot and 
item—are considered in relation to the 
flow-shop and job-shop. MOJ scheduling in 
a lot processing environment means all the 
items in a job are simultaneously processed 
and all the orders in that job have the same 
processing time. However, MOJ scheduling 
in an item processing environment means all 
the items in a job are sequentially processed 
and all the orders in that job do not have the 
same processing time. This study considers 
problems representing both cases, including 
objective functions such as total weighted 
completion time.  
To match the scheduling terminology, we 
call a wafer as an item and a FOUP as a job. 
Several items should be assembled into one 
order and several orders should be

This project presents four mixed BIP 
formulations, including Models JL-1 and 
JL-2 for the problem Jm|moj(lot), mpt, ri, 
dep|∑ =Ni iiCw1  and Models JI-1 and JI-2 for 
the problem Jm|moj(item), mpt, ri, 
dep|∑ =Ni iiCw1 . Models JL-1 and JI-1 are 
based on dichotomous restrictions, while 
Models JL-2 and JI-2 adopt the concept of 
assignment problem. 
 
 
Evaluation of the Models 
 
The eight different models are evaluated 
in two different ways. First, the problem size 
complexities of the models are presented 
and compared. Second, each model is used 
to solve real-data problems, and the 
computer solution times are compared. 
 
Size Complexity of the Models 
French [13] stated that the speed at which 
integer programming problems can be 
solved depends on the number of variables 
and constraints and that the most influential 
factor is the number of binary variables. If 
two formulations have the same number of 
binary variables, Wilson [14] and Liao and 
You [15] demonstrated that the next most 
influential element is the number of 
constraints.  
Models FL-1 and FI-1 are theoretically 
better than Models FL-2 and FI-2 for 
solving Fm|moj(lot), mpt, ri, dep|∑ =Ni iiCw1  
and Fm|moj(item), mpt, ri, dep|∑ =Ni iiCw1 , 
respectively. Furthermore, Models JL-1 and 
JI-1 are theoretically better than Models 
JL-2 and JI-2 for solving Jm|moj(lot), mpt, ri, 
dep| ∑ =Ni iiCw1  and Jm|moj(item), mpt, ri, 
dep|∑ =Ni iiCw1 , respectively. 
 
Computer Solution Time 
To determine the efficiency of the 
developed flow-shop MOJ and job-shop 
MOJ models, the models were tested using a 
computer program coded in ILOG OPL 
V3.7. Problem parameters and eight total 
models were generated and solved with 
ILOG CPLEX V10.0 on an Intel 2 Duo 
2GHz with 1.5GB RAM. Fm and Jm denote 
the flow-shop MOJ problem and the 
job-shop MOJ problem, respectively. The 
experiment consists of 12 different problem 
sizes for each MOJ problem. For each 
problem size, ten test instances are 
generated. An instance is denoted by 
AmBN×m_no, where ‘Am’ represents Fm or 
Jm, B represents L (lot processing case) or I 
(item processing case), ‘N×m’ represents the 
number of orders and the number of 
machines, and ‘no’ represents the instance 
number. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the 
computational results for Fm and Jm, 
respectively. TWC(opt) denotes the optimal 
total weighted completion time. The 
efficiency of the models is reported based on 
the CPU time (in seconds). The 
computational results also yield the 
following observations. 
(1) For computational efficiency, the 
formulation method based on 
dichotomous restrictions is better than 
the other method that adopts the concept 
of assignment problem.  
(2) For computational efficiency, the model 
for the lot processing case is superior to 
the model for the item processing case 
on the same test instance. 
(3) The average CPU time of the eight 
models increases with increasing N and 
m. 
(4) Model FL-1 outperforms Model FL-2 
for Fm|moj(lot), mpt, ri, dep|∑ =Ni iiCw1 , 
while Model FI-1 is superior to Model 
FI-2 for Fm|moj(item), mpt, ri, 
dep|∑ =Ni iiCw1 . 
(5) Model JL-1 outperforms Model JL-2 for 
Jm|moj(lot), mpt, ri, dep| ∑ =Ni iiCw1 , 
while Model JI-1 is superior to Model 
JI-2 for Jm|moj(item), mpt, ri, 
dep|∑ =Ni iiCw1 .

or more vehicles to a single customer. The vehicles have finite 
or infinite capacity and there is a transportation time for each 
direction of the delivery. Chang and Lee [2] have extended Lee 
and Chen’s [3] work to the situation when each order occupies 
a different amount of space in the vehicle. They discussed three 
scenarios of the problem, including: (1) orders which are 
processed on a single machine and delivered by a single vehicle 
to one customer area; (2) orders which are processed by either 
one of two parallel machines and delivered by a single vehicle 
to one customer area, and (3) orders to be processed by a single 
machine and delivered by a single vehicle to two customer 
areas. Li et al. [22] developed a single machine scheduling 
model incorporating routing decisions of a delivery vehicle 
serving multiple customers at different locations. Except for 
multiple customer locations Li et al. (2004) set the sum of order 
arrival times as the objective. 
Chang and Lee (2004) studied, for the first time, problems in 
which each order might occupy differing amounts of physical 
space in a transport vehicle. Based on machine scheduling and 
finished product delivery as discussed by Chang and Lee [2], 
this study deals with the situation in which the order release 
times are different and are processed on a single machine and 
delivered by a single vehicle to a single customer area. The 
objective is to determine the order processing sequence in the 
shop together with the delivery schedule to minimize the 
makespan.  
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND NOTATION DEFINITION 
This study investigates a class of the three-stage scheduling 
problem where the first stage is order release, the second is 
order production, and the three is order delivery. The 
investigative focus is on integrating production scheduling with 
order release and delivery of finished products to a single 
customer. In this problem, orders release times are different and 
are processed in a single machine then delivered in batches by a 
vehicle to a single customer. Orders require varying physical 
space while being loaded into a vehicle and delivered to a 
single customer. The vehicle is associated with a capacity 
constraint, measured by the total physical space of the orders it 
can deliver in one trip and has a specific transportation time for 
each delivery. Order completion time denotes the time when an 
order arrives at the customer. All orders delivered in one 
shipment to a single customer have the same completion times. 
The cost function measures the customer service level, taking 
supply, production, and order delivery as one system. In 
particular, this study aimed to minimize all orders delivery 
times for the customer. 
The proposed problem was described as follows. A set of n 
orders, N = {O1, O2, …, On}, had first to be processed in a 
manufacturing system by a single machine and then delivered 
to a single customer. Each order, Oi, needed a processing time 
of pi in the manufacturing system. Let ei be the size of Oi, 
representing the physical space Oi occupied when loaded in the 
vehicle. One vehicle was available for delivery, with a capacity 
of z and was first located at the manufacturing facility. Vehicle 
capacity was measured by the total physical space the vehicle 
provides for one delivery. Assuming that while the total 
physical space of orders loaded did not exceed z, they could be 
arranged to fit in the physical space provided by the vehicle. A 
delivery batch denotes all orders delivered together in one 
shipment and a transportation time is associated with each 
delivery batch. Furthermore, we define a single customer area 
as a location. In this study, the situation of deliveries made to 
just one customer area was considered. Let t01 be the one-way 
travel time between the single machine (called machine 0) and 
the single customer area (called area 1). 
The problem was to find a schedule for processing and 
delivering finished orders to the customer in the minimal time 
required for all orders in N to be processed and delivered. For 
convenient analysis, the makespan of schedule σ, denoted as 
Cmax(σ), is defined in this paper as the time when the vehicle 
finishes delivering the last batch to the customer site and 
returns to the machine. To avoid ambiguity, this is simplified as 
Cmax(σ) to Cmax. 
The three-field notation scheme, α|β|γ, introduced by 
Graham et al. [23], was applied to represent the problems being 
studied. In the three-field scheme, α was the scheduling 
environment, β described order characteristics or restrictive 
requirements, and γ defined the objective function to be 
minimized. In the α field, ‘‘Pp(Mm)→Rr” represents the 
scheduling environment of p plants, m machines, and r retailers. 
r = 1 indicated that retailers were located in one retailer area; 
hence all orders in a batch were delivered at the same time. In 
the β field, “li, v =, c =”ٛ represented the orders have different 
release times, v is the number of vehicles, and c is vehicle 
capacity. For example, P1(M1)→R1|li, v = 1, c = z|Cmax denoted 
the proposed problem with single-plant, single-machine, one 
retailer, and one vehicle carrying processed orders with total 
sizes no more than z, with the objective of minimizing the 
makespan.  
The following notation was used throughout the study: 
M  = a very large positive number;  
n  = number of orders for processing at time zero;  
Oi  = order number i;  
ei = the physical space Oi occupies when loaded in the 
vehicle; 
t01 = the one-way travel time between the single machine 
(called machine 0) and the single customer area (called 
area 1); 
z = the vehicle capacity, that is, the total physical space 
provided by the vehicle for one delivery; 
BBk  = the kth delivery batch;  
BPk  = the sum of the processing times of all orders in batch BBk; 
pi = the processing time of Oi;  
li = the release time of Oi;  
Xij = 1 if Oi was assigned to sequence position j on the 
machine; 0 otherwise; 
Yik = 1 if Oi was scheduled at batch k; 0 otherwise; 
Zii′ = 1 if Oi precedes Oi′ (not necessarily immediately) on the 
machine; 0 otherwise;

According to the concept of dichotomous constraints, 
constraint sets (5)-(11) can be rewritten as constraint sets 
(23)-(28). 
 
si + pi ≤ si′ + M (1 – Zii′)   1 ≤ i < i′ ≤ n  (23) 
si′ + pi′ ≤ si + M Zii′   1 ≤ i < i′ ≤ n  (24) 
si ≥ li   i = 1, 2, …, n  (25) 
rk ≥ si + pi – M (1 – Yik)   i, k = 1, 2, …, n  (26)

Constraint sets (23) and (24) meet the requirement that only 
one order can be processed at any time, that is, either si + pi ≤ si′ 
or si′ + pi′ ≤ si will hold. Incorporation binary variable Zii′ and a 
very large positive number M, equations (23) and (24) together 
ensure that one of these two constraints holds while the other is 
eliminated. Constraint sets (25) and (26) define the starting 
time si and the ready time rk, respectively. Constraint sets (27) 
and (28) state the relationship between Zii′ and Yik. Constraint 
set (27) guaranteed that if Zii′ = 1 then ∑  ≥ = ′nk kikY1 ∑ =nk ikkY1 , 
while constraint set (28) guaranteed that if Zii′ = 0 then 
 ≤ .  ∑ = ′nk kikY1 ∑ =nk ikkY1
The non-negativity of Cmax, Ai, si, rk, and uk, and the binary 
restrictions of wk, Yik, and Zii′ are specified in (29). 
Cmax ≥ 0; Ai ≥ 0, si ≥ 0  i = 1, 2, …, n; 
rk ≥ 0, uk ≥ 0   k = 1, 2, …, n; 
Yik is binary   i, k = 1, 2, …, n 
Zii′ is binary   1 ≤ i < i′ ≤ n (29) 
Hence, Model 2 is comprised of (1)-(4), (12)-(21), and 
(23)-(29). 
 
3.3. Comparisons of the above proposed models 
 
The above two proposed models adopt different viewpoints 
to formulate the same problem and share a common objective 
of solving the problem. Model 1 adopts the viewpoint of 
assignment problem, while Model 2 employs the dichotomous 
constraints to formulate the proposed problems. Size 
complexity indicates how large a problem is in terms of binary 
variables, constraints, and continuous (real) variables as a 
function of n, the number of orders, in the problem. Table 1 lists 
the size complexity of each of the two mixed BIP models. 
As Table 1 shows, Model 2 has (1/2)n2 + (3/2)n fewer binary 
variables, n3 − 3n2 + 6n − 1 fewer constraints, and n fewer 
continuous variables than that of Model 1. Consequently, 
Model 2 is theoretically the better model than Model 1.

IV. THE PROPOSED HEURISTIC METHODS 
Since P1(M1)→R1|li, v = 1, c = z|Cmax is NP-hard in the 
strong sense (Chang and Lee [2]), two heuristics are proposed. 
Related optimality properties have been discussed in section 2. 
Let the special case of P1(M1)→R1|li, v = 1, c = z|Cmax be all 
orders with zero processing times and zero release times. In 
such a case, minimizing Cmax is equivalent to minimize the 
number of batches and, therefore, is equivalent to solving a 
bin-packing problem. The first fit decreasing (FFD) algorithm 
is a popular heuristic for solving bin-packing problems. This 
study adopts FFD algorithm to form batches. The FFD 
algorithm was based on order sizes (ei) and vehicle capacity (z), 
the detail FFD algorithm see as follows. 
 
The FFD algorithm 
Step 1. First sort orders in non-increasing order of size. 
Step 2. Assign the largest-sized order to B B1. 
Step 3. Assign the ith largest order to the lowest indexed batch 
B Bj. If the total order size of BjB  equals z then the 
unassigned largest order is considered. Then assign it 
to BBj+1. If the total order size of BjB  less than z, then 
assign the (i+1)st largest order to B Bj. If the total order 
size of BjB  exceeds z then do not assign the ith largest 
order to BBj but consider (i+1)st as the largest order 
assigned to BjB .  
Step 4. Construct a lowest indexed batch with the most orders 
considered from the largest size and where the total 
order size does not exceed z. 
 
Since the same departure time for all orders in the same batch, 
the shortest release time first (SRT) rule is used to find an SRT 
order sequence. 
 
Property 1. In each batch of the optimal schedule, orders are 
sequenced according to the SRT rule (sequencing orders in 
non-decreasing order li). 
 
Proof: It is clear that Property 1 can be proved by the pair-wise 
interchange procedure.   
 
Heuristic H1 
Step 1. Assign orders to batches by the FFD algorithm. Let the 
total of resulting batches be b. Index the batches B B1, 
B2B , …, BBb based on the sequence of batch formation. 
Step 2. Calculate the sum of processing times for orders in 
batch B Bk denoting it BPk, for k = 1, 2, …, b. Re-index 
the batches such that BP1 ≤ BP2 ≤ … ≤ BPb.  
Step 3. Sequencing orders within each batch according to 
Property 1.
