alcohol as the anionic conductive polymer was 
investigated with respect to methanol oxidation 
performance. Differences in the methanol oxidation 
performance were compared for carbon black, graphene, 
and sulfonated graphene catalyst supports. 
Reliability was also investigated by operating each 
cell for a different number of cycles.  
2. Results  
In reliability tests, not only did Pt/sG outperform 
Pt/C and Pt/G in ESA, the catalyst decay also dropped 
from 73.33% to 17.24% when Pt/sG was used in place of 
carbon black. These results suggest that sulfonated 
graphene can increase the dispersibility of the Pt 
catalyst and increase its accessibility. For methanol 
oxidation, the maximum performance was attained after 
the 50th cycle, which suggests that all catalysts had 
been fully activated at that time. Catalyst decay was 
observed to occur after the 50th cycle, with a decay 
of 55.89% for Pt/C； this value was reduced to 9.06% 
when Pt/sG was used. This result also confirms that 
sulfonated graphene not only increases catalytic 
activity but can also enhance catalyst reliability.

1. Introduction 
The prospect of using direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) in portable electronic products is 
favorable due to their high energy density [1,2]. In 1955, during the early developmental stages of 
DMFCs, Justi and Winsel described a DMFC as being composed of a porous nickel anode and a 
porous nickel–silver cathode in an alkaline medium. The first DMFC using solid polymer films was 
designed by Hunger [3]. In addition to high energy density, other advantages to DMFCs include 
portability, ease of storage, scalability, and low pollutant emissions [4]. They are mainly used in 
electronics, such as laptop computers, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants, and are 
therefore a common component in industrialized countries. Certain limitations hinder the 
development and application of DMFCs. These limitations include methanol permeability from the 
anode to the cathode and the low catalytic activity of electrocatalytic methanol oxidation [3]. 
In alkaline DMFCs, it is critical to both overcome methanol permeability and enhance ionic 
conductivity. Numerous researchers have utilized different polymers in the synthesis of alkaline 
ion-exchange membranes, including polyvinylchloride (PVC) [5], polyepichlorohydrin (PECH) [6], 
polyetherimide (PEI) [7], polybenzimidazole (PBI) [8] and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [9-11]. 
Consequently, the mechanical and electrochemical properties of ion-exchange membranes have 
been significantly improved. Yang et al. have used polyvinyl alcohol as a substrate, which enabled 
an ionic conductivity as high as 0.11 S/cm [11]. Various alkaline membrane ionic conductivities are 
shown in Table S1.  
Because DMFCs convert chemical energy to electrical energy and exhibit high energy densities

Because the activity of a catalyst directly corresponds to its accessible surface area, a reduction of 
the particle size of the catalyst can greatly enhance catalytic activity. Therefore, the particle size 
effect of the catalyst must be taken into account because a reduction in catalytic activity can be 
caused by a low particle count [25]. The surface and bulk structure of the catalyst support is a 
crucial factor in the production of high electrocatalytic activity [26-28]. A good support must 
exhibit good electrical conductivity, a high surface area, high porosity, and excellent corrosion 
resistance. The previously mentioned properties predominantly alter the dispersibility, stability, and 
electronic properties of the catalyst.  
Carbon black was used as a fuel cell catalyst support throughout the 1990s. To increase the 
electro-catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst, numerous forms of carbon supports were 
developed in recent years, such as ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) [29], carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs) [30-32], carbon gels [33], carbon nanohorns (CNH) [34], carbon nanocoils (CNC) [34], 
activated carbon fibers (ACFs) [35], carbon nanofibers (CNFs) [36], boron-doped diamonds (BDDs) 
[37], and graphene [38].  
The excellent electrical, mechanical, and structural properties of CNTs are already well known 
[39]. Only weak intermolecular forces are present between CNTs and metal particles, which limits 
the dispersibility of the catalyst particles on the CNT support surface [40]. The most notable of 
these new carbon supports is graphene. Graphene exhibits the greatest potential for increasing the 
14 
 
electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol was thus increased [46]. Wang et al. used thermal cracking to 
prepare sulfonated CNTs and demonstrated that a Pt/sulfonated-CNT system exhibited excellent 
electrocatalytic activity and performance [47]. Sun et al. grafted benzenesulfonic groups onto 
multiwalled CNTs to adsorb Pd metal onto the surface of the CNTs. When compared to 
non-sulfonated carbon-based materials, the sulfonated multi-walled CNTs on palladium 
(S-MWCNTs/Pd) demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity with increased durability and 
tolerance [48]. These results confirm that the sulfonation of grapheme is able to make it hydrophilic, 
which enhances its dispersibility in aqueous solvents. Furthermore, sulfonation increases the 
adsorption and uniform distribution of the Pt nanoparticles, which increases both the 
electrocatalytic activity and the durability. 
Jiang et al. deposited a droplet of polyvinyl alcohol solution directly onto the electrode surface to 
form a PVA bond [49]. This step was followed by electro-oxidation of ethanol using Pt/C and 
PtSn/C catalysts in alkaline and acidic solutions. Using the same catalysts, the current generated 
from the electro-oxidation of ethanol was higher in the alkaline environment than in the acidic 
environment. Furthermore, the electro-oxidation of ethanol under an open-loop alkaline 
environment exhibited a lower potential than in the acidic environment. These results indicate that 
alkaline environments can improve the electro-oxidation efficiency of ethanol [49]. Wang et al. 
investigated the durability of carbon black and multiwalled CNTs as carbon supports under acidic 
conditions. They found that multiwalled CNTs were more durable and that the platinum surface area 
and attenuation of the redox activity were diminished [23]. Currently, little is known about the use 
16 
 
platinum colloidal solution [20, 52-54]. XC-72R and graphene were separately mixed with the 
platinum colloidal solution in a 2 M solution of sulfuric acid and ethylene glycol (1:1 volume ratio) 
and stirred for 24 h. The mixture was sonicated for 8 h and filtered and dried to yield the Pt-C and 
Pt-G catalysts. To prepare sulfonated graphene, graphene was added to a solution of aqueous 
ammonium sulfate (0.001 g in 40 mL of deionized water). The solution was then heated to 235 °C, 
filtered, and dried [55]. 
2.3 Preparation and Modification of Catalyst Inks and Electrodes 
The Pt-C, Pt-G, and Pt-sG catalysts were mixed with deionized water, ethanol, and conductive 
polymer to generate the catalyst inks, as described previously [52]. The effect of different standing 
times on the catalyst ink can be observed in Figures S1, S2, and S3. Approximately 10 μL of the 
catalyst ink was deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode and allowed to dry at room temperature to 
modify the electrode. 
2.4 Instrumentation and Measurements 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol JEM-1230, 100 kV) was used to characterize the 
sample morphologies, and an electrochemical analyzer was used to evaluate the electrochemical 
characteristics. After setting up the three-electrode device (a glassy carbon electrode was used as the 
working electrode, mercury/mercury oxide was used as the reference electrode, and a platinum coil 
was used as the auxiliary electrode), a 1 M nitrogen-purged potassium hydroxide solution was 
passed through the electrode assembly. The measurements were collected with a scan rate of 50 
mV/s, and the potential range was -1.0 to 0.2 V. The above test was repeated for a nitrogen-purged 
solution of 1 M potassium hydroxide + 0.5 M methanol using the same scan rate of 50 mV/s and the 
18 
 
graphene. 
Figure 2 shows the effects of the addition of PVA and Nafion to each catalyst ink on their cyclic 
voltammograms. Figures 2 (a), (b), and (c) show the CV curves for Pt/C, Pt/G, and Pt/sG, 
respectively, when PVA and Nafion were added as the anionic conductive polymer. Figure 2 (d) 
shows the overlay of the CV curves of the three different catalysts. From this figure, the 
electrochemically active surface areas of Pt/C, Pt/G, and Pt/sG were calculated to be 80.08 (m
2
/g Pt), 
233.62 (m
2
/g Pt), and 238.37 (m
2
/g Pt), respectively. Under alkaline conditions, the CV curves can be 
qualitatively segmented into (1) the underpotential deposited hydrogen zone (Hund); (2) the 
high-potential irreversible oxide formation zone, also known as the irreversible hydrogen adsorption 
zone (OHad,irrev); and (3) the region between the underpotential and the high-potential zones, known 
as the reversible hydrogen adsorption zone (OHad,rev) [56]. The overall reaction pathway includes 
hydrogen desorption, which is immediately followed first by the reversible adsorption of OH and 
then by irreversible oxide formation [17]. This mechanism was confirmed by titration of the OHad 
present at the Hund with a CO oxidation reaction [57]. In this study, we used PVA, an anionic 
polymer with high conductivity, to increase the adsorption of OH. Thus, for all three catalysts, as 
evident in Figure 2, the adsorption of OH in the Hund zone increased when Nafion was replaced with 
PVA, which resulted in an increase in the hydrogen adsorption/desorption surface area. 
Figure 3 shows the effects of the addition of PVA and Nafion to each catalyst ink on the 
methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Figures 3 (a), (b), and (c) show the CV curves for Pt/C, Pt/G, 
and Pt/sG, respectively, when PVA and Nafion were added as the anionic conductive polymer. The 
20 
 
of OH
-
 ions. From Figure 3, catalysis was initiated at a lower potential when PVA was used as the 
anionic conductive polymer in place of Nafion. This result suggests that PVA can more readily 
conduct OH
-
 ions, which results in a faster accumulation of OHad for the removal of CO. 
Figure 4 shows the CV curves of each catalyst after various numbers of cycles. Figures 4 (a), (b), 
and (c) show the CV curves of Pt/C, Pt/G, and Pt/sG, respectively. The influence of the molecular 
weight of the PVA on each catalyst is noteworthy and the molecular-weight-dependent 
electrochemical properties will be discussed in the future. The electrochemically active surface 
areas were calculated from the low-potential hydrogen desorption zone. The hydrogen desorption 
area decreased with an increase in the number of cycles, and it can be observed from the three 
figures that the catalyst decay was most severe for Pt/C and least severe for Pt/sG. Figures 6 (a) and 
(b) show the normalized ECSA and effective surface area (ESA) curves, respectively, from which 
the hydrogen desorption area of Pt/C was observed to decrease from 112.58 (m
2
/gPt) to 30.03 
(m
2
/gPt)—a decay of 73.33%. For Pt/sG, the hydrogen desorption area decreased from 257.58 
(m
2
/gPt) to 213.18 (m
2
/gPt)—a decay of only 17.24%. The calculated decay for Pt/G was 30.92%. 
Based on the ESA decay rate, it can be concluded that graphene provides significantly more 
resistance against catalyst decay than does carbon black. This result is attributed to the greater 
surface area of graphene, which enhances the accessibility of Pt. In addition, the sulfonated 
graphene can further resist catalyst decay, which is attributed to the greater distribution of Pt on this 
support. 
Figure 5 shows the MOR curve for each catalyst after various numbers of cycles. This experiment 
22 
 
investigated by operating each cell for a different number of cycles. Under alkaline conditions, 
PVA was used as the anionic conductive polymer in place of Nafion, both the ECSA and the 
oxidation performance were superior, irrespective of the catalyst and support. In reliability tests, not 
only did Pt/sG out-perform Pt/C and Pt/G in ESA, the catalyst decay also dropped from 73.33% to 
17.24% when Pt/sG was used in place of carbon black. These results suggest that sulfonated 
can increase the dispersibility of the Pt catalyst and increase its accessibility. For methanol 
the maximum performance was attained after the 50
th
 cycle, which suggests that all catalysts had 
fully activated at that time. Catalyst decay was observed to occur after the 50
th
 cycle, with a decay 
55.89% for Pt/C; this value was reduced to 9.06% when Pt/sG was used. This result also confirms 
sulfonated graphene not only increases catalytic activity but can also enhance catalyst reliability.

There are four keynote lectures are presented in the conference. The titles are (1)
Hardware Advances in Cryptography, (2) Human Brain Decoding: State of the Art and
Future Challenges, (3) Characterization of Coronary Plaques using Dual Energy CT, and
(4) Cardiovascular Health Informatics: Imaging identification and wearable monitoring
of the vulnerable patients. The abstract of Cardiovascular Health Informatics: Imaging
identification and wearable monitoring of the vulnerable patients is listed as follow:
Abstract: Health informatics (HI) is the rapidly evolving scientific field that deals
with the p-Health applications, processing, storage, transmission, acquisition, retrieval
(p-STAR) of biomedical information, data, and knowledge for preventive medicine,
especially for the early prediction and treatment of diseases. This new field is highly
interdisciplinary and it integrates information technology and engineering with life
sciences, healthcare, and biomedicine for human health. The health informatics is closely
tied to modern information technologies comprising all the basic and applied aspects of it,
notably in the areas of electronics, computing and communication. It becomes
increasingly essential for deployment of personalized medicine, development of modern
biopharmaceuticals, and efficient and effective management of health care. This talk
focused on the cardiovascular health informatics and discussed the information p-STAR
for the early identification, objective evaluation and real-time monitoring of vulnerable
patients with heart and stroke diseases. A proposal of the Myocardial Infarction and
Stroke Screening and Intervention within Nations using the biomedical imaging and
wearable sensing was also discussed at the end of presentation.
I gave an oral presentation with the title: “Computational modeling analysis for cell
growth using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) based time series data”.
The abstract of paper is listed as follow:
Abstract: In this paper, a computational modeling analysis on cell growth is presented.
This study aims at deriving a mathematical model for cell growth in order to understand,
analyze and predict the complex mechanisms of cell biological systems. The proposed
model was derived and validated using the practically measured cell growth curves
produced by an existing novel on-line monitoring technique, referred to as Electric Cell
substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS). The model in the form of a time response function
