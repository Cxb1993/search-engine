1. Introduction 
Because of convenience and portability, the small size display is more and more important for the growth 
of the market, such as mobile display or personal digital assistant (PDA). In the past decades, mobile phones 
only provided a monochromatic image interface for communication. With the advance of display technology, 
the mobile display has been widely used and serves multiple proposes, such as multimedia, digital camera, 
and personal schedule. Thus, the importance of image quality on mobile displays has been receiving 
increasing attention recently. It is known that image quality evaluation from a user' s point is essential and 
image quality assessment from perceived human perception is a critical issue in related literature [1, 2]. 
It is expected the image quality of mobile displays may be varying with ambient illumination since the 
ordinary users may use them in both indoor and outdoor environments. Higher illumination levels may result 
in a more harsh reflection or glare and degrade the image quality more. Thus, except for ordinary illumination 
in indoor environments, we also used a higher illumination level for comparison. In this study, 1500 lux and 
7000 lux were the two illumination levels considered. In addition, many image quality factors have been 
investigated for different displays, such as luminance, contrast, and resolution [3-5]. Due to the improvements 
in technology, most mobile displays possess have the capacity to process high resolution photos and videos 
to test the perceived image quality by the subjects. For resolution, as the best resolution for the Nokia N73 is 
320×240, we set the descending levels as follows: 320×240, 260×208, 200×160, 140×112, and 80×64. 
Therefore, there were 2 (culture level) × 2 (illumination level) × 5 (resolution level) experimental conditions.  
 
2.5 Experimental tasks, procedure and data analysis 
Both of the experiments for Chinese and American college students were divided into two stages. In each 
experiment, subjects were asked to subjectively evaluate image quality under 1500 lux and 7000 lux 
conditions in stage one and stage two, respectively. For each stage, a Likert nine point scale was utilized by 
the subjects to assess the image quality of the “fruit” image (an ISO 12640 image). To avoid memory effects, 
the levels of each factor were displayed randomly. For data analysis, perceived image quality, the dependent 
variable, was analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and LSD (Fisher’s Least Significant Difference) 
with the Statistical Products and Services Solution (SPSS) software. 
 
3. Results 
The results of ANOVA for perceived image quality and colorfulness are shown in Table 1. In the part of 
perceived image quality, the results indicate that culture (F(1, 58) = 4.708, p < 0.05), illumination (F(1, 232) = 
89.728, p < 0.01), resolution (F(4, 232) = 523.87, p < 0.01), culture × resolution interaction (F(4, 232) = 3.553, 
p < 0.01) and illumination× resolution interaction (F(4, 232) = 29.558, p < 0.01) were the significant factors. 
Thus, the significant interactions of culture × resolution and illumination× resolution (see Figure 2 & 3) were 
needed to test simple main effect. On the other hand, in the part of colorfulness, the results indicate that 
culture (F(1, 58) = 11.928, p < 0.05), illumination (F(1, 232) = 60.107, p < 0.01), resolution (F(4, 232) = 
206.172, p < 0.01), culture × resolution interaction (F(4, 232) = 3.14, p < 0.05) and illumination× resolution 
interaction (F(4, 232) = 11.07, p < 0.01) were significant. Thus, the significant interactions of culture × 
resolution and illumination× resolution were also needed to test simple main effect. Finally, further analyses 
were performed according to these two interactions for both perceived image quality and colorfulness. 
 
 
 
3.1. Culture × resolution (C × R) interaction 
For culture × resolution (C × R) interaction, we focused on each culture group, investigating the effect of 
resolution on perceived image quality and colorfulness. We then studied each resolution level and the effect of 
culture groups. 
 
3.1.1 The Chinese Group 
In the part of perceived image quality and for the Chinese group, the results revealed illumination × 
resolution interaction (F(4, 116) = 381.022, p < 0.01) was the significant factor. We then tested simple main 
effects for this interaction. The results showed that for the Chinese group in the 1500 lux condition, resolution 
was the significant factor (F(4, 149) = 152.928, p < 0.01) and the differences among five levels of resolution 
were significant through LSD method. In addition, for the Chinese group and under the 7000 lux condition, 
the results also suggested resolution was the significant factor (F (4, 149) = 106.794, p < 0.01) and the 
 4

main effect within the interaction. The results indicated that under 1500 lux and in the Chinese group, 
resolution was the significant factor (F(4, 149) = 41.175, p < 0.01) and the differences were not significant 
between the 260×208 and 320×240 resolutions, between the 140×120 and 200×160 resolutions. In addition, 
the results reflected that under 1500 lux and in the American group, resolution was the significant factor (F(4, 
149) = 33.766, p < 0.01) and the difference was not significant between the 260×208 and 320×240 resolutions, 
between the 140×120 and 200×160 resolutions. Finally, the difference of colorfulness in culture under 1500 
lux among five resolution levels was not significant only for the 260×208 resolution. 
 
3.2.2 Under 7000 lux 
In the part of perceived image quality and under 7000 lux, the results indicated that culture × resolution 
interaction (F(4, 232) = 3.949, p < 0.01) was significant. We tested simple main effect within the interaction. 
The results indicated that under 7000 lux and in the Chinese group, resolution was the significant factor (F(4, 
149) = 152.928, p < 0.01) and the difference among the five levels of resolution was found to be significant 
by the LSD method. In addition, the results reflected that under 7000 lux and in the American group, 
resolution was the significant factor (F(4, 149) = 47.297, p < 0.01) and the differences were significant with 
the 80×64, 140×120, and 200×160 resolutions, whereas the difference was not significant between the 
260×208 and 320×240 resolutions. On the other hand, in the part of colorfulness and under 7000 lux, the 
results revealed that resolution (F(4, 232) = 145.05, p < 0.01) was a significant factor and the difference 
among the five levels of resolution was significant except for the 260×208 resolution and 320×240 resolution. 
 
3.2.3 For each resolution within I×R interaction 
In the part of perceived image quality and for each resolution within I×R interaction, the differences of 
colorfulness in different illuminations were significant for the 140×120, 200×160, 260×208, and 320×240 
resolutions, whereas the difference was not significant for 80×64 resolution level. On the other hand, in the 
part of colorfulness and for each resolution within I×R interaction, the difference of colorfulness in different 
illuminations was not significant only for the 80×64 resolution. 
 
4. Discussion 
 
4.1 Effect of culture 
The results indicated that there are culture × illumination interaction both in perceived image quality and 
colorfulness. For image quality, we found that both Chinese and Americans indicated resolution was the 
significant factor under 1500 lux and 7000 lux. However, the difference was that the Chinese could better 
distinguish between the 320×240 and 260×208 resolutions while Americans could not. In addition, the 
Chinese were able to distinguish differences for all resolutions under all illumination conditions except for 
80×64, while Americans could distinguish the difference for all resolutions except for the 80×64 and 140×112 
resolutions. In this study, the 80×64 and 140×112 resolutions provided the poorer quality resolutions. Because 
of their inferior qualities, it is reasonable that Chinese and Americans are unable to distinguish the differences 
clearly, whether in an ordinary environment or brighter environment. However, the results indicated that 
Chinese could better distinguish the differences in both the superior and inferior resolutions than could the 
American group. This implies that Chinese may be more sensitive than Americans to the image quality on 
mobile displays. For colorfulness, we also found that both Chinese and Americans indicated resolution was 
the significant factor under 1500 lux and 7000 lux. However, the difference was that the Chinese could better 
distinguish between the 200×160 and 140×112 resolutions while Americans could not under 7000 lux. It 
implied that Chinese may be more sensitive than Americans under higher illumination in colorfulness. 
Based on the results above, it can be inferred that Chinese and Americans could detect more difference of 
resolution in perceived image quality than in colorfulness. For more detailed inference, in perceived image 
quality, Chinese did sensitive than Americans for detecting the difference of different solution levels no 
matter under 1500 and 7000 lux. However, Chinese only can distinguish more difference than Americans 
under 7000 lux in colorfulness. The partial reason may be that higher illumination level is benefit for the 
subjects to distinguish the colorfulness since subjects reported that they consider higher illumination makes 
the effect of colorfulness significant. In addition, another reason may be that the perceived image quality is 
the general index and it represents the overall impression which subjects consider. On the other hand, 
colorfulness is the colorful index and it is emphasized only on colors. From the opinions of subjects, they 
 8
To sum up, in perceived image quality, resolution was the significant factor under 1500 lux. However, 
there is an interaction of illumination × resolution under 7000 lux. The possible explanation may be that the 
subjects may get confused with the effect of other image quality factors under 7000 lux. Since it is so bright 
under 7000 lux, it may have genitive effects on perceived image quality for the subjects. That might be the 
reason why there is an interaction on 7000 lux. On the other hand, in colorfulness, resolution was the 
significant factor under 7000 lux. However, there is an interaction of illumination × resolution under 1500 lux. 
This result was just the opposite of perceived image quality. Since it is the ordinary illumination under 1500 
lux, it may not exhibit the feeling for colorfulness. Although sometimes too bright illumination has the 
negative effect on human perception, brighter illumination in this study did have the positive effect on 
colorfulness for the subjects. Thus, that might be the reason why we have such results on the effect of 
illumination. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the effects of culture, ambient illumination, and resolution on image quality and 
colorfulness of mobile display were investigated. The results indicated that Chinese may be more sensitive 
than Americans when evaluating the image quality and colorfulness on mobile displays. In addition, in door 
environment was more appropriate for the users to use mobile displays. Finally, for ergonomic evaluation, this 
study suggested mobile display manufacturers should design a mobile display which possesses at least 
140×112 resolution above for the future design.
