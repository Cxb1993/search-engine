In order to guarantee the QoS requirement for various service classes, hybrid priority-based scheme can 
be used in WiMAX scheduler. In the proposal, queue length is used to set the priority level. We set up two 
thresholds on the queue, a minimum threshold, Tmin, and a maximum threshold, Tmax. The proposed algorithm 
marks one of three states based on the current queue length. In state 1, all the queue lengths are below 
minimum threshold. RR fairly allocates the bandwidth slots one by one to all connections. In state 2, more 
than one queue lengths are greater than minimum threshold, but less than maximum threshold. The scheduler 
assigns the bandwidth to meet the minimum throughput requirement in term of the number of slots. In state 3, 
there are more than one queue lengths greater than maximum threshold. The longest one can be considered at 
the highest priority. More bandwidth is allocated to flows with longer queues. The proposed hybrid scheme 
combines three classical scheduling algorithms that are suited to specific WiMAX service flows. The paper 
targets to optimize the total throughput, to minimize delay and loss rate.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the Queue-Length based 
Scheduling (QLS). We have the simulation and its results in section 3. Section 4 concludes this paper.  
 
2. The Queue-Length based Scheduling (QLS) 
Suppose that a base station (BS) maintains n queues for buffer the packets of n flows that share an outgoing 
link. The proposed scheme, namely, Queue-Length based Scheduling (QLS), monitors the instantaneous 
occupancy of n queues. The algorithm marks two thresholds on the queue, a minimum threshold, Tmin, and a 
maximum threshold, Tmax (Fig. 1), just as RED [10] does.  
Suppose QLi is current queue size of flow i，where QLi≧0, and i= 1, 2, …,n. QLS finds flow i* 
according to formula (1).

3.2 Average loss rate 
Fig. 5 shows the average loss rate versus the number of nodes. There is no packet loss for three scheduling 
algorithms when the system is underutilization (N ≤50). However, the average loss rate for both DRR and 
WRR increase dramatically in case of N > 50. This is because the amount of required resources increases 
according to the increment in the total number of nodes. DRR requires a minimum rate to be reserved for each 
service flow, thus making lower loss rate than WRR, up to N=80. The value (N=80) can be considered to be 
reversed point. Both DRR and WRR have better performance after the reversed point occurs. The system 
loading could be adjusted owing to polling process. QLS performs very well even under overutilization (N 
>80). We can find that QLS is an ideal scheduling in any changing environment.

and simulation results of delay time, packet loss rate and throughput, we have shown that the proposed 
scheme has better performance than the other scheduling algorithms. The proposed scheme can provide QoS 
guarantee by ensuring a minimum throughput guarantee and also maintain small delays and loss rate.

美國取得博士學位後，留在 Bell Lab 工作，英文極好，口音跟美國人已經很像。比起
以前，台灣最近已經很少有留學生到美國，相對就很少有人在美國政府或企業公司擔
任重要職位。這對未來台灣的發展就少了一股支持的力量。雖然美國現在國力漸衰，
但其科技和國防仍有舉足輕重的地位，不容忽視。另外，印度的學術研究也急起直追，
英文在印度本來就是母語，上台報告，對他們也不是難事。印象比較深刻是一位印度

四、建議 
相對之下，印度，歐洲的聽說英文程度都比台灣及大陸好，台灣學生及大陸學生的
英文閱讀程度可能不錯，但聽說寫都有很大改進空間。聽眾有人提問，他們根本聽不懂，
也無法回答。場面就有點尷尬，應該多多練習英文聽說，及簡報能力。建議政府公費選

Abstract—Call admission control plays an important role
in International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication
Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Quality of Services (QoS) archi-
tecture of next generation network (NGN). We extend both BPC
and BPC-IF call admission control [23] to exploit their capability
of robustness and fairness in response to the variation of network
status. Simulation results show that the modified BPC and BPC-
IF algorithm is effective in supporting robustness in terms of
utilization, while achieving good fairness of network resources.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Internet is considered as a foundation of a next genera-
tion network (NGN) [1-2]. NGN is evolving in the direction of
a packet-based network for both real time and non-real time
traffic. Internet based NGN now is widely discussed in the
standards bodies. European Telecommunications Standards In-
stitute (ETSI) [3] and International Telecommunication Union-
Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) [4] have
proposed the Quality of Services (QoS) architecture of NGN,
in which service stratum and the transport stratum are assumed
to be independent. VoIP service, for instance, is established
by dynamic call setup signaling. The request QoS from the
application can be dynamically changed. Network resource
control is, thereby, performed during the call setup signaling
and transport stratum reserves network resources for the QoS
request.
The key component in ETSI NGN is the resource and
admission control sub-system (RACS), which provides end-
to-end QoS [3]. The control region of RACS covers the access
network and the edge of the core network. In ITU-T NGN,
access resource and admission control functions (A-RACF)
make the admission decision based on the resource state of the
access network, and the service-based policy decision function
(SPDF) performs the policy-based decision and the control of
the border of the core network [4].
In conventional CAC, one or several bandwidth brokers
(BB) manage network resource based on the policy and take
admission decision for each call request [5-6]. However, this
approach cannot scale well due to its centralized architecture.
The ability of BB to handle growing volumes of flows suf-
fers as the network size increases. Recently, many methods
of scalable CAC have been proposed. We may categorize
them into two main approaches: parameter-based [7-8] and
measurement-based [9-14] CAC.
Active CAC performs the decision to join the network
based on the probing of the network using probe packets.
Probe-based admission control (PBAC) [9] provides a reliable
upper bound to the packet loss probability a flow will suffer
in the network. To perform the loss measurement, PBAC
uses probe packets that are sent at the peak rate of the new
session. PBAC also designs queuing function of service class
to differentiate data packet from probe packet, so that probes
do not disturb ongoing data sessions. Active CAC requires no
explicit support from routers and thus avoids the scalability
problem of maintaining per-flow state at each router. However,
the probing process might incur a rather long setup delay,
especially in the case of burst traffic. Thus, active CAC faces
a scalability problem when the network utilization is high.
Passive CAC, on the other hand, uses passive measurement at
egress router to take admission decision.
We take two algorithms- blocking percentage calculation
(BPC) and blocking percentage calculation with instant feed-
back (BPC-IF) [13], with some parameters modified and added
in them, as our target CAC. An ideal CAC estimates the
admissible bandwidth as close to the real available capacity
as possible. In both BPC and BPC-IF algorithms, a small
spacing between the calculation of the admissible bandwidth
and the real available capacity results in low blocking rate and,
consequently, a higher utilization [13]. In this article, we take
robustness and fairness as two indicators of performance of a
CAC. Robustness is defined to be the ability to handle against
the failure nodes under various traffic characteristics. Fairness
is defined as the capability of maintaining the difference
between the throughputs experienced by all the calls as small
as possible.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the modified call admission control. We have perfor-
mance evaluation in section 3. Simulation result demonstrates
the feasibility of the scheme. Finally, section 4 concludes this
paper.

III. SIMULATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
This section details the performance evaluation of the pro-
posed admission control algorithm. The experimental topology
is shown at Fig. 1. We use NS-2 network simulator [20] as
well as its ns2VoIP module [21] to simulate four sources
of VoIP flows. G.711 voice codec was generated from four
source nodes in this simulation. Table 1 and Table 2 list the
voice codec bandwidth calculation and parameter setting in the
experiment, individually. The link rate of each link is assumed
to 100Mbps and the node-node delay is fixed to 10 ms. Four
schemes are compared. They are BPC, BPC-IF, PBAC [9] and
the original approach. The original approach uses Erlang-B to
calculate the blocking probability (Pb) derived from the Erlang
distribution to describe the probability of call loss in ingress
node of a VoIP network. The formula is given below:
Pb =
Em
m!∑m
l=0
El
l!
(6)
where m is number of source nodes and E is the total amount
of traffic offered in Erlang, which is calculated as the average
arrival rate (λ) multiplied by the average call length (h).
Performance is evaluated varying the following parameters:
the number of blocking nodes and the number of calls. The
end-to-end delay and packet loss rate are measured at the
destination corresponding to Mean Opinion Score (MOS).
The subjective MOS test procedures are presented by ITU-T
recommendation P.800 [22], by which users rate the perceived
conversational speech quality in a scale from 1 (poor quality)
up to 5 (excellent). The ITU-T G.107 [23] defines the objective
E-model. The E-model combines all impairment parameters
that affect a voice call into a single factor, which then can be
converted into MOS score. G.711 objective quality has been
modeled at ITU-T G.107 [23], G.108 [24], and G.113 25]. A
2% packet loss rate and 150 ms end-to-end delay, whose MOS
estimate is approximated to be 4, is aimed at by our model.
The buffer size of each node is kept quite small (60 packets)
to minimize the queuing delay. However, once the overload
calls are admitted, packets may be lost.
A. Scenario 1
Robustness is desired for one CAC so that calls in progress
could be maintained in case of failure occurrence. In this
scenario, we evaluate robustness of four schemes by fixing
the network size to be 36 and varying the number of failure
nodes from 1 to 10. From Fig. 2, we can see that BPC-IF runs
the link at a higher utilization level with increasing number of
failure nodes. The reason is that quick feedback mechanism

of BPC-IF has the advantage of fast routing and fully utilizing
the network. PBAC behaves not very well because the probing
packet may lose in the network due to failure nodes, thus
resulting in erroneous estimation of network resource. The
original approach even yields to the lowest utilization (45%)
when the number of failure nodes increases up to 10.
