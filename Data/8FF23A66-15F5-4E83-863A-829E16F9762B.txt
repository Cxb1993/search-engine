design, called type-III filter, is proposed. As shown in 
Fig. 1, the resonator of type-III filter consists of both 
the open and short-circuited stubs. This filter structure 
is similar to that in [14]. However, in their study, the 
absolute bandwidths of the two passbands are 
restricted to be the same since the electrical lengths of 
the stubs are forced to be   at the average frequency 
of the two passbands. In this project, type-III filter 
does not have such a limitation because the lengths of 
stubs are also the design parameters. The inverters 
between the resonators can be realized with 
coupled-line sections. Since a uniform coupled-line 
circuits could not generally have both the properties of 
the dual-band inverters and resonators, a new structure 
of stepped-impedance coupled lines is firstly 
introduced. Its equivalent circuit is derived and then 
the basic equivalent circuit of type-III filter is 
modified. It was found that type-III filters have the 
advantages such as the reduced circuit size and more 
freedom of passband frequency ratio and bandwidth 
ratio. Finally, a filter design example is given, and its 
experimental results are well with the theoretical 
prediction. 
 
II. STEPPED-IMPEDANCE ASYMMETRIC  
COUPLED LINES 
For the inverters and stubs realized with the 
coupled-line sections, it was found that 
stepped-impedance coupled lines are inherently 
necessary to have the dual-band properties [12]. The 
proposed stepped-impedance coupled-line structure is 
shown in Fig. 2, which is composed of two identical 
asymmetric coupled-line sections. These two 
coupled-line sections are connected skew 
symmetrically, and the diagonal ports are grounded. 
The electrical length of a single coupled-line section is 
θ , which is defined at the fundamental passband 
frequency, 1f . The even- and odd-mode characteristic 
admittances, 0eY  and 0oY , are defined with the 
assumption that the lines are driven by identical 
magnitude of voltages with equal and opposite phases, 
and the detailed calculation can be found in [15]. The 
complete Y  matrix of the stepped-impedance 
coupled-line structure is calculated as

From (1), the equivalent circuit of the 
stepped-impedance coupled-line structure is proposed 
as that shown in Fig. 3. After comparing the Y  
matrices of the circuits in Fig.2 and Fig. 3, the 
conditions for these two circuits to be equivalent at all 
frequencies are found as

B. Coupled-Line Sections in the Outer Stages 
Type-III dual-band filters need coupled-line 
sections in their exterior stages, which are used to 
transform the impedances of the system terminations 
to higher values, and they can be achieved by 
employing the rest of the open and short-circuited 
stubs with characteristic admittances of 2y  and 3y  
in the outer-stage resonators, as shown in Fig. 8(a). 
The first step of the design procedure is to set the 
transformed termination equal the system conductance 
0G  by using the Kuroda identities of the second kind 
[17], as shown in Fig. 8(b), and the characteristic 
admittance ay  can be obtained as 
 0

It is clear that the open and short-circuited stubs at the 
left-hand side have the same characteristic 
admittances. Then, the same components are extracted 
from the stubs at the right-hand side, the open and 
short-circuited stubs are replaced with a single 
short-circuited stub using the equivalence given in 
Fig. 9. After that, the transmission line and the shunted 
short-circuited stubs with electrical lengths of 2θ  
could be equivalent to the short-circuited coupled 
lines, as shown in Fig. 8(c), and their even- and 
odd-mode characteristic admittances are given by

So far, the coupled-line circuit design is exact 
without any approximation. However, there are still 
two stubs left at the right-hand side of Fig. 8(c), and 
they are attempted to be included in the coupled-line 
circuit. This can be done approximately, with the 
following procedure. Based on the admittances 0eY  
and 0oY  derived in (24) and (25), the line widths w  
and gap s  of the coupled-line circuit can be obtained 
with the help of the CAD tools. One of the shorted 
coupled-transmission lines, which is attached to the 
right-hand-side open and short-circuited stubs, is 
supposed to be a single short-circuited stub regardless 
of the coupling. Then the characteristic admittance of 
the short-circuited stub with a line width of w  is 
calculated. By means of the equivalence in Fig. 9, the 
short-circuited stub is equivalent to the open and 
short-circuited stubs with half the characteristic 
admittance and electrical length. Now they can be 
combined with the right-hand-side open and 
short-circuited stubs shown in Fig. 8(c), and could be 
further equivalent to a stepped-impedance 
short-circuited stub using the equivalence again. The 
required line widths 1w  and 2w  for the 
stepped-impedance short-circuited stub are then 
available. Finally, the coupled-line circuit in the outer 
stage for type-III filter is constructed by the 
short-circuited stub with a line width of w  and a

stubs are separated into two equal parts for the synthesis of the
coupled-line circuits in the middle stages.

roughness of about10 mµ and dielectric loss tangent of 
0.005 have been included in the simulations. The 
measured passband central frequencies are at 2.42 
GHz and 5.24 GHz, and the corresponding 21S  
are –6 dB and –5.3 dB, respectively. The measured 
3-dB bandwidths are about 4.1% and 5.3%. Generally, 
the measurement results are well with the 
specifications, and the type-III dual-band filter has 
been successfully achieved. 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
A new dual-band filter structure, which is called 
type-III filter, is studied in this project. A new 
structure of two-section asymmetric coupled lines is 
first proposed and studied, which can be used for the 
realization of the short-circuited stubs and inverters. 
Then the basic configuration of type-III filter is 
modified based on the derived equivalent circuit of the 
coupled-line structure. Type-III filters have more 
freedom of passband frequency and bandwidth ratio 
than type-II filters. The total circuit size is also 
reduced. The stepped-impedance coupled lines are 
used to implement the exterior sections of type-III 
filters. Finally, a design example of type-III filter is 
given and its measured results show good agreement 
with the predictions.
