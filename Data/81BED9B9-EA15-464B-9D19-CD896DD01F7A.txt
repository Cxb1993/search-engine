1. Introduction 
Occupational skin diseases are prevalent among employees in industrial settings worldwide and have 
been important in the public health (Arberarskydsstyrelsen, 1984; Diepgen and Coenraads, 1999; 
Matthias and Morrison, 1984; Vaaranen et al., 1984). Employees may expose to diversified 
chemicals such as detergents, acids, alkalis, fumes, solvents, heavy metals and other irritants as well 
at various occupational settings and develop irritant contact dermatitis or other skin diseases 
(Wigger-Alberti et al., 1999). The occupational skin diseases cause appreciable impact on the quality 
of life (Hutchings et al., 2001; Cvetkovski et al., 2006) and may increase the body burden of 
toxicants by the skin route for workers (Kutting and Drexler, 2003; Ahaghotu et al., 2005).  
 
Smoking, a hygienic behavior, has long been considered for workers as a modifier of hazardous 
chemical absorption (Brown et al., 1980; Ulenbelt et al., 1990). Previous studies have demonstrated 
smoking could increase the body burdens of heavy metals such as increasing blood lead and urinary 
cadmium concentrations (Satarug et al., 2004; Karita et al., 2005). Although the cigarette is a 
substantial source of chemical hazards, smoking habit causes the oral intake of contaminants at work 
(Chuang et al., 1999; Watanabe et al., 2004). The mechanism of the interaction of chemical 
absorption and smoking, and other associated factors on the body burden of chemicals remain not 
well explored. 
 
Skin diseases including irritant and allergic contact dermatitis are common complains in cement and 
concrete workers because of strong alkalinity of and high hexavalent chromium concentration in 
cement products (Bock et al., 2003). Hexavalent chromium is also a carcinogen associated with the 
risk of respiratory tract cancer (Mancuso, 1997; Bagchi et al., 2002; O’Brien et al., 2003). The 
internal dose of chromium is thus an important health issue for cement workers. Both the skin 
disease severity and host factors may affect the uptake of chemicals readily through the skin (Drexler 
et al., 1995; Chou et al., 2004a). Little research has been done on the relationship between the 
pathological status of the skin and internal dose of chromium in cement workers. In addition, 
smoking is a high prevalent habit in general workers in Taiwan (Wen et al., 2005). To our knowledge, 
no evidence has been documented for the influence of smoking on the body burden of chromium in 
cement workers who have the skin diseases.  
 
The purpose of the present study was to measure the urinary chromium level for cement workers and 
to investigate whether the concentration is associated with skin disease and smoking habit. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
Subjects and personal measurement 
Forty five workers (38 men and 7 women) were recruited as study participants from members of the 
cement industrial union in mid-Taiwan. With informed consent, an industrial hygienist conducted a 
face-to-face interview with each participant for information on demographic status, lifestyle 
(smoking and drinking, etc.), use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hygienic behavior, and 
health history. This study was approved by the review committee, the Council of Affairs Institute of 
Occupational Safety and Health. 
 
The personal factors potentially affecting the amount of urinary chromium concentration were 
measured in three domains: PPE, personal hygienic habits, and skin diseases. The PPE domain 
included whether the subject used to wear a mask, gloves, a face cover, or an apron. The personal 
hygienic habits domain consisted of hand clean habit, detergent use, and lotion use at the work. PPE 
wearing and hygienic habits were closely observed and recorded on the day, when urine samples 
were collected, to avoid the memory misleading. Pathological skin conditions for skin disease 
domain included hand eczema and other skin disease, diagnosed by a dermatologist from a medical

Factors associated with urinary chromium levels in multivariate regression model 
Table 2 shows factors that may influence the urinary chromium concentration by stepwise regression 
analysis. Using gloves along could reduce the level for 48.4 μg/L with a R2 of 0.23 (p < 0.001). After 
the addition of eczema status, smoking, and employment history, the R2 increased to 0.44 and 
significant increases of the chromium levels were associated with hand eczema (30.4 μg/L, p = 0.04) 
and smoking (24.3 μg/L, p = 0.049). But, the protective effect of gloves reduced in accounting the 
body burden. On the other hand, for workers with any skin disease model, after the addition of 
employment history, smoking, and any skin diseases, the R2 increased to 0.42 and significant 
increases of the chromium levels were associated with smoking (26.6 μg/L, p = 0.03). The skin 
diseases status became a less significant factor in accounting the body burden. 
 
Risk for chromium level greater than biological exposure index 
Workers with the chromium levels exceeding the BEI level were at an increased risk of having skin 
problems with ORs of 9.1 (95% CI, 1.9-43.5) for hand eczema and 17.2 (95% CI, 2.2-137.2) for all 
skin diseases (Table 3). The OR for hand eczema increased from 5.4 (95% CI, 1.0-29.0) among 
non-smokers with exceeding BEI to 42.0 (95% CI, 4.7-371.5) for smokers. Similar pattern appeared 
in the model for workers with any skin disease. 
 
4. Discussion 
Our study findings are consistent with the previous study conducted by Guo et al. (1999) that hand 
eczema is the major skin disease among cement workers. The risk of hand eczema or any skin 
diseases increased 5.4 or 11.6 times, respectively, for workers with urinary chromium exceeding the 
BEI level. The mean urinary chromium concentration in cement workers with hand eczema was 
approximately more than 10 times higher than that in workers with no skin disease. Irritant and 
allergic contact dermatitis are complains frequently occurred in cement workers because of 
hexavalent chromium in cement product (Bock et al., 2003). Previous investigations have 
documented that skin disease may increase the skin uptake of carbon disulfide in occupational 
settings (Drexler et al., 1995; Chou et al., 2004b). Hence, the skin contact could be an important 
factor contributing to the urinary chromium level and resulting in an increased total body burden of 
chromium for cement workers with skin disease exposed to cement.  
 
We also found smoking was another factor contributing to the increased total body burden of 
chromium for cement workers in this study. Previous studies have demonstrated that smoking is one 
of the factors that may significantly increase the blood lead levels for lead battery workers in 
workplace (Chuang et al., 1999). The study conducted by Karita et al. also demonstrated higher 
blood lead concentration in current smokers than in ex- or never smokers among lead exposed 
workers (Karita et al., 2005). Contaminated hands or food increased blood lead concentration of 
workers. Another study conducted by Fierens also indicated that male smokers have higher serum 
dioxin levels than non-smokers (Fierens et al., 2005). Chromium absorption may be promoted by 
unhygienic behavior such as smoking at the workplace and smoking before hand washing. Smoking 
is a highly prevalent (61%) behavior among industrial working forces in Taiwan (Wen et al., 2005). 
Cement workers also smoked frequently at work with both hands and cigarettes are likely 
contaminated with the cement, increasing the intake of chromium. The correct knowledge about 
personal hygiene and smoking cessation in the workplace should be considered to reduce the total 
body burden of chromium in cement workers. 
 
From the multivariable regression analyses, we acknowledged that the use of gloves can reduce a 
good amount of the body burden of chromium. But smoking along contributes an average of 
approximately 25.0 μg/L of chromium measured in the urine. An extra burden of more than 30.0 
μg/L of chromium can be measured for persons who have developed hand eczema. Compared with
