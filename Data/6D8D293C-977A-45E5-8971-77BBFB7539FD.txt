Abstract 
This study discusses poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) that is produced by Delftia 
acidovorans bacteria in fed-batch cultures from various carbon sources. The experimentally 
determined optimal fed-batch culture conditions are as follows: pH: 7.0, incubation temperature: 
26 °C, incubation time: 72 h, concentration of carbon source: 10 g/L. The maximum 4HB unit 
composition of P(3HB-co-4HB) obtained using the fed-batch culture with a cell concentration of 
about 2.5 g/l was 94 mol% although the P(3HB-co-4HB) content remained low, at around 13 
wt%. The extent of the enzymatic degradation of P(3HB-co-4HB) was determined by involved 
PHB depolymerase and lipase. The tensile strength of P(3HB-co-4HB) markedly decreased 
during two hours of degradation by PHB depolymerase, whereas that of P(3HB-co-4HB) 
degraded by lipase for 50 hours was at least 3 MPa.

1. Introduction 
The biotechnology field has attracted 
considerable attention in recent years, because 
biotechnology can be exploited in the food sector, 
environmental protection, medical services and other 
sectors, it has become a competitive field of research 
in many countries (William et al., 1999; Valentin et 
al., 1997; Hein et al., 1997; Amirul et al., 2008). 
Since the 1980s, because of environmental pollution 
as well as the daily worsening of petroleum resources, 
the use of biotechnology to develop an alternate 
energy or material source has been a very important 
area of research (Kunioka et al., 1988, 1989; 
Hiramitsu et al., 1993; Kang et al., 1995). 
The development of biodegradable polymer is 
one area of biotechnology research, not only can 
biodegradable polymer be manufactured in an 
environmentally friendly way, but also it is 
degradable to carbon dioxide and water by 
microorganisms in the environment. Accordingly, 
such manufactured synthetic products do not need 
further processing after they are used. They are 
highly favored for both environmental protection and 
medical application. (Saito et al., 1994, 1996; Kimura 
et al., 1992). 
Poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s [PHAs] are typically 
biodegradable, with good biocompatibility, making 
them attractive for use in tissue engineering in both in 
vitro and in vivo studies (Levenberg et al., 2003; 
Wang et al., 2003, 2004; Jiang et al., 2004; Siew et 
al., 2007). Since the product of decomposition is 
harmless to humans, using them in the human body 
has no detrimental side effect. Their biodegradation 
rates and mechanical properties can be modified for 
specific applications. They are particularly effective 
for implantation and can be easily manufactured in 
the desired forms. The major concern associated with 
polymer scaffolds is their low mechanical strength 
after enzymatic degradation and retention failure. 
Therefore, the mechanical strength and 
biodegradability of these biodegradable polymers 
must be improved. 
Microorganism-synthesized polymers are 
generated using organic acids, saccharides and 
alcohols as starting materials. Currently, these 
microorganisms have synthesized polymers that have 
included P(3HB), P(3HB-co-3HV), P(3HB-co-3HP), 
P(3HB-co-4HB) and others (Sombatmankhong et al., 
2007; Senior et al., 1971; Yokouchi et al., 1973; 
Renner et al., 1973 ; Kamiya et al., 1989 ; Choi et al., 
1999, 2003). The specificity of the matrices of 
microorganisms is such that different microorganisms 
and culture conditions of pH, temperature, 
microorganism concentration, carbon source and 
others, produce various biodegradable polymers (Lee 
et al., 2004; Taidi et al., 1994 ; Doi et al., 1990 ; 
Müller et al., 2007). 
The fermentation of A. eutrophus and C. 
acidovorans using fructose, glucose and an organic 
acid as mixed carbon sources generates the 
biodegradable polymer (Kamiya et al., 1989; Mitomo 
et al., 2001). Since several microorganisms can use 
 6 
(at pH = 7.0) with 10 g l-1 of 1,4-butanediol as the 
sole carbon source at 26 °C.  Figure 1 plots the 
relationship between the 4HB fraction and the 
polymer content for various incubation times in 
two-step fermentation. When the incubation time was 
24 hours, the lowest of the 4HB fraction of 
P(3HB-co-4HB) copolymer and the content were 28 
mol% and 2 wt%, respectively, suggesting that the 
incubation time did not suffice to accumulate the 
polyester in the bacterial cells. However, at an 
incubation time of 96 hours, the 4HB fraction of the 
copolymer and the content became 79 mol% and 8 
wt%, respectively, indicating that the microorganism 
consumes the polymers that accumulated in the 
bacterial cells as the carbon sources became deficient 
in the culture solution at an incubation time of 96 
hours. 
 
3.2. Effect of pH on biosynthesis of the 
P(3HB-co-4HB) 
To evaluate the effect of changes in pH during 
the biosynthesis of the P(3HB-co-4HB) polymer, 
biosynthesis was conducted using two-step 
fermentation with 10 g l-1 of 1,4-butanediol as the 
sole carbon source at 26 °C for 72 hours. Figure 2 
plots the relationship between the 4HB mole fractions 
and polymer contents at various pH values in 
two-step fermentation. The highest 4HB fraction and 
copolymer content in the pH 7.0 culture solution that 
contained 10 g l-1 of 1,4-butanediol were 
approximately 94 mol% and 13 wt%, respectively. As 
the pH value in the culture solution increased above 
7.0, the 4HB fraction and the polymer content 
declined significantly to arround 54 mol% and 1 wt%. 
The 4HB fractions at pH 6.5 and 6.0 were 87 mol% 
and 58 mol%, respectively and the corresponding 
polymer contents were 11 wt% and 5 wt%. 
 
3.3. Effect of concentration of carbon source on 
biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-4HB) 
To evaluate the effect of the carbon source 
concentration on the biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-4HB) 
polymer, the biosynthesis was performed using 
two-step fermentation (pH = 7.0) at 26 °C for 72 
hours. Table 1 presents the results of the copolyester 
generated by D. acidovorans for various 
concentrations of the carbon source in the two-step 
fermentation for 72 hours at 26 °C. D. acidovorans 
yielded the P(3HB-co-4HB) copolyester from 
n-butyric and 1,4-butanediol as the mixed carbon 
sources. The 4HB fraction and polymer content of 
P(3HB-co-4HB) were determined from changes in 
the mixed carbon source concentrations of 5 g l-1, 10 
g l-1 and 15 g l-1. P(3HB-co-4HB) was produced from 
10 g l-1 of the mixed carbon sources, and the 
polyester content in the dried cells was as high as 13 
wt%, while the 4HB fraction of the polymer was 65 
mol%. The 4HB fraction of the polymer was 65 
mol% when 5 g l-1 of the mixed carbon source was 
used, yielding an outcome similar to that with 10 g l-1 
of the mixed carbon sources, but the polymer content 
was lower, at around 9 wt%. When the polymer was 
produced by biosynthesis from 15 g l-1 of the mixed 
carbon sources, both the 4HB fraction and polymer 
content were at their lowest values of 16mol% and 
4wt%, respectively. 
 
3.4. Cultivation of Delftia acidovorans using various 
carbon sources 
Table 2 presents the results of the production 
of polyester by D. acidovorans with numerous carbon 
substrates at 26 °C. The P(3HB) homopolymer was 
generated by D. acidovorans with glucose, 
saccharose, fructose, glutaric acid or n-butyric acid as 
the only carbon source. The P(3HB-co-4HB) 
copolymer was produced from 4-hydroxybutyric acid, 
1,4-butanediol or gamma-butyrolactone, and the 
polyester contents in the dried cells were as high as 
14wt% when 1,4-butanediol was used. n-Butyric acid 
and 1,4-butanediol were used as the mixed carbon 
sources to increase the polymer contents of 
P(3HB-co-4HB) synthesized by D. acidovorans. 
P(3HB-co-4HB) with a wide composition was 
synthesized by D. acidovorans from the mixed 
carbon sources of n-butyric acid and 1,4-butanediol, 
which are relatively cheaper than the other chemicals. 
These results suggest that D. acidovorans can 
synthesize P(3HB-co-4HB) with a wide range of 
compositions from a mixed carbon source of 
n-butyric acid and 1,4-butanediol in the feed. 
The samples of P(3HB-co-4HB) copolymer 
whose enzymatic degradation and tensile strength 
were evaluated, were produced from n-butyric acid 
and 1,4-butanediol by D. acidovorans in two-step 
fermentation at 26 °C for 72 hours. Table 3 presents 
results concerning the production of P(3HB-co-4HB) 
copolymer. 
 
3.5. Enzymatic degradation of P(3HB-co-4HB) 
Figure 3 presents the enzymatic degradation 
of P(3HB-co-4HB) films in an aqueous PHB 
depolymerase from R. pickettii T1. The copolymers 
with lower crystallinity (4HB: 10.9 & 20.0%) 
degraded faster than P(3HB), indicating preferential 
degradation in the amorphous regions. The rate of 
drgradation of the copolymer of P(3HB-co- 51.5 & 
75.6% 4HB) was slower than that of P(3HB). To 
evaluate effectively the tensile strength of the 
degraded copolymer, the degradation time was 
maintained below 5 hours. 
Figure 4 presents the enzymatic degradation 
of P(3HB-co-4HB) films in aqueous lipase from R. 
delmer. This lipase is known selectively to degrade 
the 4HB component and an inverse behavior to that 
in Figure 3 is clearly expected. P(3HB) exhibited no
