I. BACKGROUND 
Cerebral vascular accident (CVA), known as “stroke”, represent insufficient 
nutrient or oxygen supplements of brain tissues causing permanent neurological 
damage, functional disability and death [1-2]. Two thirds of stroke patients reported 
motor difficulties in daily activities, and half of them remain functional deficient and 
limitations in activities of daily living [3-5]. Less than 20% of them reported fully 
motor or functional recovery after stroke [6]. Medical complications such as poor 
cardiopulmonary condition, and systemic infections may occur due to reduction of 
physical activities or immobilization [7-10]. Besides, the performance of stroke 
patient may depend on psychological factors, which may hinder functional recovery 
and has a negative impact on maintenance of individual self-independence.  
Upper limb impairment is common in stroke patient [11]. Motor dysfunction from 
upper extremity hemiparesis may severely limit ADL activities, such as eating, 
dressing, bathing, and writing [12-13]. Stroke patients with paretic extremities 
reported difficulties performing functional tasks [14]. Therefore, more effective 
approaches are needed in upper limb rehabilitation following stroke. 
A variety of rehabilitation techniques are used in clinical practice. Conventional 
physical therapy is based on neuro-rehabilitation and muscle strengthening[15]. 
Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) emphasizes the neuromuscular 
promotion via stimulation of the proprioceptors, and purposes to enhance muscle 
stability as well as flexibility[16]. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), 
also called “forced use” which stroke patients were told to finish tasks of ADL only 
with their affected upper limbs, and clinical improvement on motor function 
supported this approach [17]. Other intervention such as functional training and 
therapeutic exercises are also considered in stroke rehabilitation.  
 
A. Functional electrical stimulation therapy 
Functional electrical stimulation (FES), has positive effect on upper limb motor 
recovery [24-26]. It generate short electrical current to induce muscle contraction 
[20-21]. Studies reported that FES therapy could also affect the sensory pathway 
resulting in the normalization of reflex motor activities or spasticity reduction, and 
improve blood circulation of the affected muscle during contraction[22-23]. Based on 
the concept of neural facilitation, therapeutic exercise combined with FES could 
induce recovery of neurological deficits and then has a better performance on motor 
function [27-28].

II. STUDY MOTIVATION 
Not only Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) but the combination approach of 
FES and BAT was found effective on motor and functional improvements in previous 
studies. In addition, some clinical outcomes showed the latter could decrease 
neurological deficits and improve voluntary movements in those stroke patients 
[56-58]. However, these studies mostly focus on the hand function recovery after 
bilateral training with FES instead of hand performance. Goal-directed behavior is 
consist of both strategy planning and movement implementation [59]. Besides, some 
studies confirmed that better performance in reaching could transfer to other arm 
activities and improve trunk stability, also increase the interaction of external 
environment [53, 60, 61]. On the other hand, a loss of arm reaching ability may lead 
to motor dysfunction, and severely influence different levels of executing tasks. Due 
to the importance of forward reaching ability, therapeutic exercises of training 
reaching movements should to be concerned. 
In this study, FES therapy in combination with BAT was designed for upper limb 
rehabilitation after stroke. Outcome measures involving clinical scales and kinematic 
information, were evaluated at baseline (week 0), after 3-week intervention (week 3), 
and at follow-up (week 7). The result analyses were to explore whether or not the 
combination approach has a better effect than BAT alone. More details of the system 
design and experiment were described in the following sections.

stimulation [62] for pain relief (Fig. 10). In this study, a custom program is selected to 
have the self-triggered function which is more effective for stroke facilitation [63-66].  
The parameters of the functional electrical stimulator (TensMed 931&S82) 
were set in following description: Continuous electrical stimulation was with a 
frequency of 80 Hz. The pulse duration was a control variable (50~400 us) for safety 
considerations, and could be adjustable according to the severity of arm impairment in 
each stroke patients.

B. Software programming  
A virtual instrumentation software platform, Lab VIEW ®  8.6 software (National 
Instruments, Austin, TX), were used for kinematic data acquisition, signal processing, 
and FES control programming.  
 
Information data of bilateral reaching movements, the analog output signals from 
the change of electrical resistance, could be received or detected by two linear wire 
potentiometers (HPS-S-R, HONTKO, CO., LTD., R.O.C. (Taiwan)). Besides, two 
linear wire potentiometers were connected to a computer via a DAQ board (NI 
USB-6008, National Instruments, Austin, TX), which was used for analog-to-digital 
conversion (0V to 5V in a voltage change). Because the initial position of reaching 
was set at the full reaching length (approximately 50 cm), a simple estimate of linear 
equation was used to calculate the transformation from a voltage change (x) to the 
reaching length (y):

is a comparator to compare the difference between the input signal and the sensor 
output for further analyses.

Finding an error due to the affected arm falling behind, a control signal is sent to the actuator, FES 
trigger. 
 
The human-machine interface of this study was developed using the LabVIEW 
control panel, allowing interaction between users and the system platform. First, the 
input parameters including “the initial length”, “the reaching length” are adjustable 
according to each patient. Second, the option “left or right” represents the affected 
arm of each patient to show the kinematic parameters and graphs in the LabVIEW 
control panel. The amount of reaching movements in each cycle of the experiment 
could be chosen. Generally, ten times per cycle would be appropriate.  Besides, the 
FES is set up before starting a training program. 
The kinematic variables for reaching in the affected arm, including displacements, 
velocities, accelerations, the movement time, the peak velocity, etc., could be shown 
during experiment. Four graphs (displacement graph, velocity graph, acceleration 
graph, accelerometer graph) are used to provide immediate information of bilateral 
arms and shoulder movements. After experiment, the kinematic information, such as 
the movement time, peak velocity, and percentage of peak velocity, would be 
calculated for further analyses. 
 
 The Connection flowchart of the software and the hardware is shown below. 
During the reaching movements, the kinematic information was collected by the 
linear wire potentiometers (HPS-S-R) transforming a voltage change to displacement.

IV. EXPERIMENT 
A. Participants  
Stroke subjects were recruited from the National Taiwan University Hospital 
(NTUH). The training program of BAT without FES was performed before as a 
control group, these patients were only conducted to perform bilateral reaching 
movements by using a cross rod, In the experimental group patients executed the 
exercises on a linear guide platform with FES feedback control. Before starting the 
intervention, each participant signed the document of informed consent in accordance 
with the NTUH Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
Inclusion criteria were:  
1. Clinical diagnosis of unilateral stroke  
2. Able to understand and follow simple verbal instructions 
3. Brunnstrom stage for the arm less than IV 
4. No excessive spasticity in the affected arm (The modified Ashworth Scale 
(MAS) ≦ 2) ) 
5. Unable to perform the active movements of full elbow extension.  
 
Exclusion criteria of the stroke patients were as follows: 
1. Upper limb comorbidities for limiting functional improvement  
2. Unable to tolerate the level of FES needed for some visible muscle 
contractions 
3. The affected elbow contracture greater than 15°  
4. Unstable cardiopulmonary function. 
  Besides, the basic medical information of each stroke patient was recorded 
before intervention.  
 
B. Experimental protocol 
The intervention consisted of 6 sessions of 1 hour duration, twice a week for 3 
weeks. FES could provide assistance if necessary. Subjects sat upright in a chair with 
back support. A flowchart of the experimental protocol in this study is shown in 
Fig.18General physical examination and the clinical scale measurements were 
performed by a physical therapist at the start of each experiment. For the functional 
electrical stimulator, the stimulation frequency 80 Hz, the amplitude was 20 mA.The 
pulse width was chosen as adjustable parameters from 50 us to 400 us. 
Four self-adhesive surface electrodes were placed on the motor point of the triceps 
brachii muscle and anterior deltoid muscle in the affected arm. The stimulation 
intensity was set for provide enough assistance of reaching movements but not for 
 11 
 
 
Fig 6 A flowchart of experimental protocol. 
C. Assessment  
    Stroke subjects underwent assessment in their affected arms by a single blind 
physical therapist at three times: pre-treatment (week 0), post-treatment (week 3), and 
at one month follow-up (week 7). Physical examination was performed, such as stroke 
severity, muscle tone, muscle strength, etc. Clinical assessment included the 
Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity section (FMA-UE) is used for 
evaluating motor impairment in upper limb after stroke[69-70]. The Action Research 
Arm Test (ARAT) is used for measuring upper-extremity movements (both arm and 
hand) function[71-73]. And the Motor Activity Log (MAL) is a physical activity 
questionnaire which can determine the frequency and intensity of their upper limbs in 
daily activities [74-76].  
Kinematic data were collected using LabVIEW language as an objective 
description of motor performance. The kinematic variables for forward reaching 
included the movement velocity (MV), the peak velocity (PV), and the percentage to 
peak velocity (PPV) during reaching movements: 
1. Mean velocity (MV): Movement velocity refers to the mean velocity for 
execution of each forward reaching movement. Because each subject may 
have different reaching length depending on the length of the upper limb, MV 
can used to evaluate the moving condition of reaching movements objectively

V. RESULTS 
Thirty five stroke patients were recruitment from NTU Hospital. Twenty three 
participants (10 in the experiment group and 13 in the control group) completed the 
treatment process (Fig. 17). Outcome measures of clinical scales were to evaluate the 
effects of BAT combined with FES in patients with stroke, and it was performed as 
follows:

A. Clinical outcomes 
An independent samples t-test compared both groups for similarity in subjects’ 
demographic data (Table. 2) and baseline clinical characteristics, and there were no 
statistical difference between two groups.  The assumption of normality was 
assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. There was no statistically difference from a 
normal distribution on the FMA-UE test, but the outcome data from the ARAT and 
the MAL test did not fit a normal curve.  Thus, both parametric and nonparametric

The MAL test (both AOU and QOM) revealed no significant difference was found 
for either between-group or within-group comparison (Fig.8). Both groups showed 
extremely low scores on the MAL-AOU and MAL-QOM. However, there was still a 
trend of improvement in the experimental group.

supported the combined evidence proposed by some researches. The combined 
evidence could be interpreted both the sensorimotor integration and dynamic systems 
theory (interlimb coordination) [86-88]. Cauraugh et al applied this theory to stroke 
rehabilitation and reported that two coupled training protocols are better than one [89]. 
Chronic stroke participants were divided into three groups: bilateral movement 
training with EMG-triggered stimulation, unilateral movement training with 
EMG-triggered stimulation, and control group. They found decreased reaction time 
and higher motor capability in the paretic hand existed after the coupled training.  
    Chan et al designed the combination experiment of BAT and FES in hand 
rehabilitation following stroke [84]. Significant improvement was obtained in clinical 
outcome measures, including Functional Test for the Hemiplegic Upper Extremity 
(FTHUE), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), and active ROM of the wrist joints. 
Other reasons for better motor performance after the combination approach in this 
study could be explained. The augmented proprioceptive feedback from FES linked 
sensory intention to motor response, facilitating neuroplasticity and therefore 
enhancing motor recovery [27, 90-91]. 
   After intervention, whether the carryover effect existed or not should be 
reconsidered. At follow-up on the ARAT test, significant improvement lasted for one 
month in the experimental group and statistical differences were shown between two 
groups. Some explanations for continuous improvement at follow-up could be 
inferred, such as patients’ continuous active participation after the experiment [92-93]. 
Active repetitive movements, though as a key factor for motor recovery [27], could be 
evaluated obviously by the ARAT test. In addition, sensation change in a stroke 
patient after such approach was reported to have lasting positive effects on motor 
performance in the affected hands [94]. 
   However, the results from MAL test showed there was no significant difference 
either within group or between two groups. The findings in our study were as the 
same as other studies. A phenomenon of “learned nonuse” in the affected upper limb 
usually exists following stroke. Researchers found that those patients with stroke 
mostly executed daily activities using their non-paretic arms, regardless of some 
motor improvement of the affected arms [51, 90, 95-96]. 
   Other clinical effects such as spasticity reduction or antagonist muscle inhibition 
were not found in our experimental results. Some studies suggested therapeutic 
training or neuromuscular stimulation could reduce spasticity [97-99]. Hesse et al 
reported that stroke patients decreased spasticity and improved motor control in the 
severely affected arm after using a robot-assisted arm trainer for bilateral exercises 
[100], but such improvement seemed not to exist after the combined approach in this 
study. Spasticity interferes with active motor performance during performing

VII. CONCLUSIONS  
This preliminary study demonstrated the beneficial clinical effects on combined 
bilateral arm training (BAT) with functional electrical stimulation (FES) in patients 
with stroke. Although clinical measures revealed no statistical difference existed 
between two groups, the experimental group may have a trend for improvement after 
intervention. Besides, considering the clinical results of the Action Research Arm Test 
(ARAT), the experimental group showed significant improvement after intervention, 
and at follow-up. The kinematic data which were collected using LabVIEW language 
confirmed the positive results after such combination approach. In comparison of 
pre-test, the movement velocity (MV), the peak velocity (PV), and the percentage to 
peak velocity (PPV) showed significant improvement after intervention. The 
improvement of the movement velocity even lasted at follow up. These findings 
implied that the neural facilitation or brain plasticity may be induced through 
therapeutic exercises combined with self-triggered FES.  
In the future, it is needed to assess whether or not to increase the treatment doses 
and the intervention timing in order to have better clinical effects. More functional 
approaches, such as the training program consisting of both arm and hand movements, 
would be also considered in upper-limb stroke rehabilitation.

IX. APPENDIX  
Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) 
The clinical scale is a 6-point rating scale that is use to evaluate the grade of 
muscle spasticity in patients with neurological conditions. 
Grade Description 
0 No increase in muscle tone. 
1 Slight increase in muscle tone, and minimal resistance release at 
the end of the joint range of motion (ROM) when the affected 
part is moved in flexion or extension. 
2 Slight increase in muscle tone, followed by minimal resistance 
throughout the remainder (less than 1/2 )of the joint range of 
motion (ROM) 
3 More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the 
ROM. 
4 Considerable increase in muscle tone 
Difficult to move the affected part passively 
5 Affected part rigid in flexion or extension 
 
 33 
 
flexion at 90° 
V Spasticity is decreased. 
1)Arm can raise to a 
side-horizontal position 
2) Arm-raising forward and 
overhead 
3) Forearm movement in 
pronation/ supination, elbow 
extended 
1) Palmar prehension 
2)Possible cylindrical and 
spherical grasp 
3) Mass extension of hand 
VI Isolated joint movements are 
performed 
All prehensile types under 
control 
VII Nearly normal Nearly normal
