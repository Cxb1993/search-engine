1. Abstract
The main purpose of this project is to
develop a method that can be utilized to
process a sequence of images with
low-resolution to obtain an image with high
resolution. The steepest decent (SD) algorithm
is used and modified in the project to approach
the unique solution in the
Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimator that is
one of the most commonly used methods of
super-resolution. We exploit not only the
method to make the SD algorithm simpler, but
also promote the correctness of the result.
Finally, experimental results reveal the
correctness and superiority of the proposed
methods.
Keywords: Super Resolution, Enhancement,
Image Registration, Sharpness.
2. Introduction
The image is the most direct information
for a human. In many fields, e.g., spying,
medicine, astronomy, surveillance, etc., the
high resolution images are often required. But
it is usually hard to get an image which is
distinct enough to be recognized from the
image systems in the world. When a scene is
converted to a digital image, the losses of
information is impossible to be avoided. The
process of a real world scene converted to a
digital image is shown in Figure 1. We can
divide the process into two parts: the optical
effect and the digital effect. In the first part, the
light in the real world goes through the
atmosphere and the lens. If the sensor is not
fixed, then the motion blur is produced, which
will result in an image with optical blur and
distortion created. In the second part, the result
of the first part is projected onto the CCD (or
the CMOS) sensor. The sensor next digitizes
the blurred scene into a digital image. Because
of that, there will be several light projects onto
a pixel of the sensor in the same time. So, the
fusion of the light makes the digital image to
become more blurred, and there is much
information disappeared. Finally, due to the
fact that some noises created and add into the
image, the quality of the obtained image is
very poor, and it is highly required in many
practical fields to have a higher resolution
image from multiple low resolution images.
This is the main purpose of the project.
3. Proposed method and experimental
results
3.1 Proposed method
Assume there are N frames of
low-resolution images obtained from a camera.
3initial guess can be used to save much time to
approximate the super-resolution result, the SD
algorithm is required to obtain a more finer
result. Suppose TD and D are both real
transform operators. The DDT could be ignored
if jZ
^
is a real high-resolution image. The
reference image of matching is jZ
^
itself, and
jk
T
k ZFF
^
is equal to jZ
^
. Finally, we get a
formula below from equation (4) as:
(6)
After several iterations by using Equation
(6), an image with super-resolution can be
obtained accordingly. However, a high
resolution image with real pixels is required,
the following process is employed. First, the
high resolution image H is decomposed into
several low-resolution images as:
(7)
where iSF is a separator to produce the
low-resolution image iL from a high-resolution
image H . For each iL , we can find out the
similar images by the pixel level matching
again, and every pixel in iL will be related to
a set of pixels coming from the similar images.
Finally, the median intensity of the related
pixels for every pixel in iL is selected to
re-composite the result image.
3.2 Experimental results
For evaluating the proposed resolution
enhancement method, a standard test target,
ISO12233 resolution chart, is used. ISO12233
resolution chart is a picture composing by only
black and white blocks, and is often used to
test the resolution ability of the camera and the
correctness of the images. The Figure 2 shows
a picture with black and white circles. Half of
the circles are sparse, and the rest are close. In
Figure 2 (a), the radius of the circles are longer
from center to outward originally, but the
peripheries look quite different. It is called
Moire pattern. In Figure 2 (c), the proposed
method solves the problem. In the figure, it can
be shown that the spatial resolution is
enhanced. Now, the separation of the close
circles in the obtained super-resolution result is
higher than the original images.
The Figure 3 shows a color result of the
proposed method. It is noted that the color in
Figure 3 (c) is correct, and the noises of source
image is removed. Moreover, the texts on the
top and right-bottom in Figure 3 (c) are more
distinct than those that not processed by our
method. And many objects, like the clock, the
brain, and the funnel, become clearer, too.
4. Conclusions and further works
This project proposed an efficient and
faster super-resolution algorithm to process the
images with low resolution captured from a
single camera. Many low-resolution images
are tested by the proposed method, and the
results reveal that it did enhance the spatial
