DN1 case, the parameters in the DN2, DN3 and DN4 cases almost follow a symmetric 
concave-up distribution versus the density under the same reduced wind velocity.  This 
indicates that the aerodynamic parameters in the DN3 case are the minima along the density 
distribution.

1. INTRODUCTION 
  Due to economical development, the modernization rendered rapid population growth in 
cities, and further facilitated more and more construction of higher buildings in many urban 
areas where space is highly limited.  Because of their stiffness lessened, these buildings 
become more susceptible to wind excitation.  This is especially evident for high-rise buildings 
in which the excessive responses are even interacted with the wind flow and thus the so-called 
aero-elasticity forms (Simiu and Scanlan [1]). Therefore, searching a possible solution to relieve 
the threat of wind hazard to high-rise buildings is inevitable and compulsory from engineering 
perspectives.  
The across-wind motion of a structure is mainly categorized as the vortex-induced 
vibration and galloping (motion-induced vibration).  The vortex-induced vibration is caused by 
the vortex-shedding in the wake of the structure body, accompanied by the turbulence effect 
from the fluctuation of incident flow if it exists.  For a particular shape of structure, the 
periodicity of the vortex-shedding is characterized by the Strouhal number (Str=fD/U), i.e., the 
vortex-shedding frequency f is proportional to mean wind velocity U.  At a particular wind 
velocity when the shedding frequency is close to the structural frequency, the large structural 
response occurs which is the so-called resonance.  Under this circumstance, even though the 
wind velocity increases, the across-wind motion starts interacting with the aerodynamic force so 
 4
vortex-induced vibration and galloping has been presented by Corless and Parkison [6]. 
It is well recognized that the vortex-induced lock-in effect and the galloping effect in the 
across-wind motion of high-rise buildings should be avoided as much as possible since the 
possible nonlinear behavior on the response makes the ordinary spectrum analysis tend to be 
non-conservative (Kwok and Melbourne [7], Hayashida et al. [8], Cheng et al. [9]).  For some 
super high-rise buildings, the occurrence of resonance and lock-in is unavoidable due to their 
low natural frequencies, and therefore the idea of aerodynamic damping has been introduced for 
predicting the response (Cheng et al. [9], Vickery and Steckley [10]).  According to to-date 
development in wind engineering, the researches on the vortex-induced vibration after lock-in, 
in particular the theoretical link with experimental data, still remain challenging.  To better 
understand such a behavior, this study aimed at investigating its mechanism for the 
two-dimensional section structures under smooth wind flow as the first step toward 
three-dimensional modeling.  The literature review (e.g., Parkinson and Smith [5], Corless and 
Parkison [6], Khalak and Williamson [11], Khalak and Williamson [12], Williamson and 
Govardhan [13], Bahmani and Akbari [14], Amandolese and Hemon [15], etc.) indicated that the 
vortex-induced lock-in or galloping is a self-limiting process due to nonlinear 
amplitude-dependent loading.  Instead of the investigation on the pattern of pressure change on 
the oscillating body (e.g., Bearman and Currie [16], Bearman and Obasaju [17], etc.), in this 
study, a conceivable theoretical self-limiting model was adopted as the key phase for developing 
the identification scheme for section models to identify their aerodynamic parameters (such as 
aerodynamic damping and stiffness) through wind tunnel response measurements.   
In wind engineering, the motion-induced wind model near resonance and lock-in with the 
self-limiting character was first proposed by Ehsan and Scanlan [18] and later was extended as 
the generalized Van der Pol Oscillator by Larsen [19].  Based on our extensive studies on

near resonance and lock-in, according to Ehsan and Scanlan [18] and Simiu and Scanlan [1], can 
be written as a nonlinearly interacted force as

is the dimensionless frequency (reduced frequency) 
with )2( f    being the vortex shedding frequency in radians per second;  , 1Y , 2Y , LC  
are various dimensionless aerodynamic parameters.  In equation (2), two types of forces are 
involved, one is induced by the vortex shedding, which is expressed as the lift force term )(tCL , 
the other is excited by the response itself, the so-called motion-induced force which is expressed 
as the combination of aerodynamic damping and stiffness effect.  The linear and nonlinear 
parts of aerodynamic damping parameters are represented by 1Y  and  , respectively, while the 
aerodynamic stiffness parameter is expressed as 2Y .  The nonzero parameter   provides the 
behavior of a self-limiting motion. 
    Firstly the lift force )(tCL  is assumed to be a harmonic function with an amplitude 
)(KCL  and a phase θ , i.e., 
    )sin()()( θt KCtC LL    (3) 
By combining Eqs. (1)~(3) and making nondimensionalization for all quantities, the resultant

, that is, the solution is a harmonic function with a slowly varying amplitude )(sA  and phase 
)(sψ .  In other words, it is a so-called quasi-linear system.  Due to lock-in behavior, the 
reduced frequency K in Eq. (8) is no longer the nondimensional vortex shedding frequency, but 
the reduced vortex-induced frequency at lock-in.  Since this expression of the solution involves 
two unknowns )(sA  and )(s , an additional condition as used by Van der Pol [21] can be 
used as the supplement to the solution procedure, i.e.,  
0)](sin[)()()](cos[)(  sψKssψ sAsψKssA   (9) 
The meaning underlying Eq. (9) is that )(sA  and )(s  are considered to be constant while 
making the derivative on )(s .  Based on Eqs. (6)-(9), the coupled 1st order differential 
equations for )(sA  and )(s  can be derived as

    By using the quasi-linear assumption, i.e., the amplitude )(sA  and phase )(s  vary very 
little with respect to s, the derivative )(sA  and )(s   can be treated as constants within any 
cyclic period K2 .  Therefore, by combining with the change of variable ψKsp  , the 
right-hand side of Eqs. (10) and (11) can be conceivably replaced by the average of their values

the Scruton number as a whole.   
When the dimensionless time s , the response amplitude approaches a steady-state 
amplitude 
A   (21) 
In other words,   is actually the final steady-state amplitude. 
 It should be noted that, for the case that the combined vortex-induced lock-in and galloping 
occurs, such as the experimental results that will be shown in the later section, the solution of 
self-limiting response in Eq. (20) can be still used to interpret the actual measured data. 
2.3 Identification Scheme of Aerodynamic Parameters 
According to Eq. (20), when the bluff body lock-in occurs, an initial amplitude will finally 
lead to a steady-state amplitude   as time goes by.  Depending on that the magnitude of the 
initial amplitude is larger or smaller than  , the identification scheme by employing such a 
decaying or growing process are termed as Decay-to-Resonance (DTR) method (see Fig. 2(a)) 
or Grow-to-Resonance (GTR) method (see Fig.2 (b)), respectively.  Based on the experiments 
normally observed as shown in Fig. 2, it takes longer time to get to the steady-state response in 
the GTR case than in the DTR case.  The identification scheme is described in the following. 
(1) Identification of 1Y  and   
During the transient state before approaching to the steady state, the ratio of the initial 
amplitude versus the amplitude in the n-th cycle can be derived from Eq. (18) as

approach to a constant (i.e., 0)(  s ) when the steady state sustains, the parameter 2Y  can be 
calculated from Eq. (15) as

2.4 Improvement of the Results by Optimization Scheme 
To further improve the accuracy of the parameters 1Y , ε  and 2Y , these three identified 
values are used as the initial guesses to an numerical optimization problem that curve-fits the 
experimental response time histories and the theoretical formula in Eq. (20).  The performance 
index (objective function) for optimization was based on the least square method, which is 
defined as 
2

)]()([ iexp
N
i
i ssP.I.      (31) 
in which exp  is the experimental response data and N is the total data point.  In this way, the 
value of parameters 1Y , ε  and 2Y  can be numerically fine tuned to more precisely fit to the 
experimental response data point by point in the time domain. 
3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  
 As shown in Fig. 3, the section model of the experimental mockup is supported by two sets 
of spring connection on a T frame outside the two sides of the wind tunnel.  The across-wind 
 14
shown in Fig. 4, the steady-state amplitude after lock-in has the trend of increasing with the 
reduced wind velocity (=U/f1D=2π/K1) for the cases of DN2, DN3 and DN4.  While in the 
DN1 case, the tail part slightly reverses from increasing to decreasing at the reduced velocity of 
about 8.5.  Notice that the inverse of the reduced wind velocity is within the vicinity of the 
value of the Strouhal number, which is 0.13 for square sections (Bearman and Obasaju [17]).  
The range of vortex-induced frequency versus the structural frequency ( f / f1) for each case 
is tabulated in the column (8) of Table 1.  The value shown in Table 1 indicated that they are all 
smaller than 1.0.  That is, in all the experimental data, the vortex-induced frequency 
approached to the structural frequency (and thus causes the resonance and lock-in) but did not 
exceed the structural frequency.   
Also shown in the column (9) of Table 1 is the Reynolds number that was kept in the range 
of more than the critical value 2x104 to ensure the applicability of the tested results to the 
buildings of actual sizes. 
The aerodynamic parameters 1Y , ε  and 2Y  were identified following the identification 
scheme as described in the GTR method.  Note that there exists an inflection point in the 
transient time history of the gradually increased amplitude as shown in Fig. 5.  An extensive 
examination of the analytical solution in Eq. (20) has revealed that the growing part of the 
transient time history always follows a concave down track before finally reaching the 
steady-state amplitude.  As the assumption of the analytical solution used for Eq. (5) indicated, 
before the trajectory getting to the inflection point, the response is small and concave-up 
distributed, therefore this part is not suitable for the analytical response of the GTR method.  
To reduce the statistical error in the identified results, the average of the results from the GTR 
method for three different episode lengths T, 2T/3 and T/2 (see Fig. 5) were used for each 
measured data set.  A typical comparison of the time histories between the experimental and

To check the validity of the identified parameters, the steady-state response   in each 
case is simulated by using the regressive results of parameters expressed in Eqs. (32) and (33).  
The simulated results were shown and plotted by the solid curves in Fig. 4 in comparison with 
the experimental results denoted by the open marks.  As Fig. 4 indicates, the prediction of the 
simulation is quite satisfactory.  
Since the four tested models are mainly distinguished by their densities (their dampings are 
rather close), to more clearly observe the density effect on the parameters 1Y , ε  and 2Y , the 
3-dimensional surface plots of the regressive curves versus the reduced wind velocity and 
density were shown in Figs. 8, 9 and 10 for 1Y , ε  and 2Y , respectively.  It is intriguingly 
seen that excluding the DN1 case, the DN2, DN3 and DN4 cases almost follow a symmetric 
concave-up distribution versus the density under the same reduced wind velocity.  This 
indicates that the aerodynamic parameters in the DN3 case are the minima along the density 
distribution. 
 18
combination effect reflecting on the aerodynamic parameters 1Y , ε  and 2Y , as observed from 
Fig. 7, is that they are all monotonically decreasing with the reduced velocity and finally 
asymptotically approaching to a constant at the high branch. 
6. CONCLUSIONS  
The findings of this study can be summarized as follows: 
(1) The analytical solution of across-wind lock-in behavior from a conceivable 
self-limiting model showed that the aerodynamic parameters are not only 
functions of the section shape and reduced wind velocity but also dependent on 
both the mass ratio and structural damping independently, rather than on the 
Scruton number as a whole.   
(2) The across-wind aerodynamic parameters of four section models (DN1~DN4 
varied by density ranging from 226 to 409 kg/m3) after the lock-in stage in smooth 
flow conditions have been successfully identified using the GTR method based on 
wind tunnel measurements.  The optimization of the curve-fitting for 
experimental and analytical response in time domain was further performed to 
finalize the results for the improvement of accuracy.  
(3) The identified results show that, after the lock-in stage, the across-wind 
steady-state amplitude has the trend of increasing with the reduced wind velocity 
for the DN2, DN3 and DN4 cases which indicates an asymptotic combination with 
the galloping behavior.  While the tail part of the DN1 case slightly decreases, 
indicating that a pure vortex-induced lock-in persists.  All three aerodynamic 
parameters Y1, ε and Y2 decrease as the reduced wind velocity increases for almost 
all cases except the parameter ε  in the DN1 case, in which the tail part slightly
