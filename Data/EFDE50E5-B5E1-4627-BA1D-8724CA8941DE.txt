I中文摘要
關鍵字: 鎂合金、塊狀非晶複合材料、破裂韌性
有鑒於能源短缺與 3C 產業發產需求，輕量化且具有高強度、硬度、良好加工性、低
磁損與耐腐蝕性等特質之鋁基、銅基、鈦基、鎂基與鋯基等非晶質合金為近年來深受矚目
之研究主題。其中鎂基合金，非但為目前使用之結構材料中最輕的金屬，亦具有散熱迅速、
防止電磁波干擾且可回收的優點。但由於非晶質合金本質之低剛性及較差之室溫成形性，
以致使該合金的製造和應用受到限制。因此為了能更進一步提升非晶質合金之剛性與加工
性，目前主要以合金成分調配的方式為主，研發具有高性能之塊狀非晶質合金。本研究研
發出之具有良好熱性質與熱穩定性之非晶質合金組成後，再以添加不同尺寸(微米至奈米)
與比例之強化相顆粒於非晶質基材中，用以形成非晶質合金複材。利用非晶質基材中分散
均勻的顆粒形成散佈強化的機制以獲得高性能之非晶質合金。
本計畫採用便捷的真空電弧熔煉與高週波熔煉法將鎂基非晶質合金基材與選用之顆
粒(鉬、鈦、鐵等)形成合金鑄錠，再使用噴射鑄造法形成板狀或圓柱狀棒材。所獲得之非晶
質合金複材試片進行後續之熱性質與機械性質研究，以及微觀組織的觀察。本研究除獲知
塊狀非晶質合金複材最佳之製程條件與顆粒添加比例外，並發現若於鎂基非晶質合金中添
加適量鉬或鐵顆粒時，該合金可展現優異之機械性質，包括強度、硬度、壓縮性與破裂韌
性等皆可獲得相當程度的提升，此成果可做為未來實際應用時之參考。

2類鎂基非晶質合金雖能突破尺寸限制並具有良好熱性質，但若將其於室溫下進行壓縮測試
時，其壓縮應變量仍只有 0％-2%[27-33]。因此改善鎂基塊狀非晶質合金的塑性應變能力與
延展性，以擴展鎂基非晶質合金之應用範圍乃是相當重要的課題。
在鋯基[34,35]與銅基[36,37]塊狀非晶質合金之壓縮測試研究中顯示，添加或析出二次
相在非晶質基材中可有效改善合金之延展性。例如在 Zr-Al-Cu-Pb 與 Zr-Al-Cu-Ni-Ti 系多元
合金中[38,39]，若其基材裡含有大量的 Zr2(Cu,Pb)或 (Zr,Ti)3Al 奈米結晶相，除可使該合金
之延展性和抗拉強度獲得改善外，其過冷液相區間更可達 100K 以上。研究顯示，若以添
加二次相強化非晶質合金，則所選用之二次相以次微米至奈米尺寸之陶瓷顆粒，如碳化矽
(SiC)、奈米碳管(Carbon nanotube)、碳化鎢(WC)和碳化鋯(ZrC)等，或具高熔點之元素為主
如 Ta, Fe, 或 Mo 等，已獲得具有優異性質之塊狀非晶質合金或合金複材[40-42]。添加之二
次相顆粒需均勻分散於基材中，不與基材互溶且不影響基材的非晶結構。此外，若選用奈
米顆粒為二次相更需注意其分散性，避免奈米顆粒在基材中團聚造成缺陷而降低塊狀非晶
質合金之機械性質。
因此其後有關非晶質合金之機械性質改善研究亦以此為依據，利用在非晶質基材中添
加顆粒或析出二次相形成非晶質合金複材，且強化相顆粒需均勻分散於基材中以形成散佈
強化機制，因而塊狀非晶質合金可產生較佳的塑性應變率並有效改善韌性。例如在
Zr-Cu-Ni-Al 四元非晶質合金中添加 8at%Ta 元素取代部份 Cu，造成微米級及奈米級之富
Ta 相析出，則該合金之塑性應變量可達 38.8%，並同時保有高熱穩定性與降服強度。此外，
Ma 等學者在 2003 年利用添加鐵及 TiB2 將鎂基非晶質合金的強度提高至 1000MPa，比一般
鎂基非晶質合金高了約 200MPa[25,28]。而且根據 Wang 教授等人研究發現，添加不同比例
的延性 Nb 顆粒在 Mg-Cu-Gd-Ag 非晶質合金內[43]，亦可獲得約有 900 MPa 左右的壓縮強
度，其產生的塑性變形量也高達 12%，如圖 1 所示。因此常用之二次相除了前述之陶瓷顆
粒以外，亦可採用延姓金屬顆粒，如以 Fe、Nb 等。選用金屬顆粒為強化相亦須注意分散
之均勻性及其與基材不互溶性。而有關添加延性金屬顆粒最主要的優點分為以下幾點描述
之：
（1） 延性金屬顆粒能阻礙 shear band 的傳播。
（2） 當 shear band 在延性金屬顆粒內移動時，延性金屬顆會吸收剪應變量，防止裂縫擴
大或快速蔓延。
（3） 當基材和添加顆粒的彈性係數相差過大時，shear band 會沿著基材和添加顆粒的界
面移動，而形成二次 shear bands 減少應力集中。
（4） 當施加之應力到達某一程度時，大量的 shear bands 會形成網織狀，將應力分散至
整體基材上。
藉此二次相的析出或添加，非晶質合金複材不但可擁有高於傳統合金 2~3 倍的強度，
且可承受一定的塑性變形量，其韌性亦提高，因而可改善非晶質合金在結構材料應用上受
到侷限的缺點。
2. 研究目的
本計畫以具有高強度與高熱穩定性之鎂基非晶質合金系統為基礎，利用添加二次相的
方式形成非晶質合金複材，之後再進行其熱性質及機械性質之改善效果研究。首先，在鎂
基非晶質合金方面是以Mg-Cu-Y-(Gd, Nd, Ag)為基材，預計共可形成 (1) Mg-Cu-Y-Gd、
4電弧熔煉法(arc melting)、高週波熔煉法(induction-melting)與噴射鑄造法(injection -casting)。
依照選定之非晶質合金組成，先以電弧熔煉法將熔點較高的元素合成為較低熔點且均質的
合金鑄錠，其後再將Mg元素或欲添加之二次相顆粒(如Mo、Ti或Fe等)與合金鑄錠進行高週
波熔煉，形成具散佈強化機制之塊狀非晶質合金複材。電弧熔煉與高週波熔煉法之簡便性
有利於進行合金成份之改質及強化相之添加。
其後針對合成之塊狀非晶質合金與合金複材進行機械性質測試(如壓縮測試、彎曲測試
與奈米壓痕測試等)。進行測試所需之板材或棒材需以噴射鑄造法製備，將金屬熔液快速噴
射注入水冷銅模內急速冷卻後，依照銅模的尺寸可分別製作出直徑為2mm~10mm、長為
45mm的棒材，以及厚度2mm或3mm、長為50mm的板材，如圖5所示。

secondary shear bands are formed during the plastic deformation process. It indicated that the
addition of Mo particles for the plasticity improvement of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 alloy is
contributive.
Introduction
In recent years, research of the structural materials, such as titanium, zirconium, copper,
aluminum and magnesium alloys, with high specific strength to density ratio has been aroused
due to the worldwide problems of resource shortage and environment contamination. The most
well known lightweight material is low cost and easy recycling Mg alloy systems (the specific
weight for Mg is 1.7 g/cm3, for Al is 2.7 g/cm3 and for Ti is 4.5 g/cm3 respectively). Many efforts
[1-4] have been strived for the developments of Mg-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs),
especially for the Mg-Cu-RE (RE: rare earth metal, such as Y, Gd, Nd and Tb) and Mg-Ni-RE
alloy systems [5-8], because the Mg-based BMGs possess high compressive fracture strength
(~850 MPa) and good corrosion resistance, as compared with the conventional Mg-based
crystalline alloys. It was found that the Mg-TM-RE (TM: transition metal) BMG rods [9,10] with
high glass forming ability, large supercooled liquid region and 4-9 mm in diameter can be
prepared by using copper mold casting method at a low critical rate of about 102 K/s recently.
However, the Mg-based BMGs show the low ductility problems during the plastic
deformation process. Just like others BMGs [11-15], the failure mode of Mg-based BMGs is
brittle because the formation of localized shear bands predominate the deformation behavior of
Mg-based BMGs. The inherent low workability of the Mg-based BMGs limited their application.
In order to figure out this problem, the researchers have demonstrated that ceramic or metallic
powders can be regarded as the second phase particles to disperse in the BMG matrices, such as
Zr-based [16] BMGs, to retard the shear bands and the cracks propagation and to form the
multiple shear bands during plastic deformation. Following this concept, many kinds of the
Mg-based bulk metallic composites have been developed with the addition of numerous kinds of
the second phase particles (such as Fe, TiB2, ZrO2, WC, SiC and Nb) since 2003 [17-22].
According to the previous reports, it was showed that the compressive strength and the impact
toughness of the Mg-based BMG composites were improved by the appearance of dispersion
strengthening mechanism. Even so, the promotion of the plastic strains for of the Mg-based BMG
composites is still restricted.
The intent of the present study is to develop a new Mg-based BMG composite, which
exhibits superior strength, toughness and plastic strain, by adding the second phase
reinforcements. The Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG with high glass forming ability was selected as the
base alloy. The Mo powders are used to be the additive in the base material to form the
Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites. The chosen second phase particle, Mo, has great thermal
properties and high corrosion resistance, which is stable and immiscible with the BMG matrix.
The effects of the second phase addition on the thermal property and on the mechanical property
of the brittle Mg-based BMG composites are examined in this paper.
16
In order to explore the additive effect of the Mo particles on the thermal properties, the glass
transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization temperature (Tx) and the melting temperature (Tl)
of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites were measured by DSC scans at a heating rate of 20
K/min. Non-isothermal DSC traces for the BMG composites are shown in Figure 4. The thermal
analysis results are listed in Table 1, together with the estimated data, including Tx(=Tx-Tg, the
supercooled liquid regime), Trg(=Tg/Tl, Tg: glass transition temperature; Tl: liquidus temperature),
(=Tx/(Tg+Tl) and m (=(2Tx-Tg)/Tl). There is no distinct change of Tg can be found with the
addiing of the Mo particles. The Tx and the Tl decreased slightly with the increasing of the Mo
content, causing the worthless reduction of the GFA parameters, such asandm. The Mg-based
BMG composites with the Mo dispersion maintained high thermal stability and high GFA. This
result corresponded with that of the XRD observation.
For the investigation of the mechanical properties for the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites,
the uniaxial compression tests were conducted at room temperature with a strain rate of 5x10-4 s-1.
Figure 5 reveals the true stress-strain curve of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites with various
contents of Mo particles via the compressive tests. Fracture stress (f), elastic constant (E) and
plastic strain (p) of the BMG composites were extracted from Figure 5 and summarized in Table
2. It is concluded that obvious plastic strain of the BMG composites was obtained by the adding
of Mo particles. The optimal fracture strength and plastic stain of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG
composites with 20 vol% Mo content approached to 1 GPa and 6.2%, which is higher than that of
TiB2- or Nb-containing Mg-based BMG materials. The fracture surfaces of the compressive
specimens were examined by SEM and their morphology are shown in Figure 6. Compressive
failure mode of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 base alloy was brittle (with ~0% plastic stain, as shown in
Table 2). Therefore, the feature of fracture morphology of the base alloy (in Figure 6 (a)) was the
smooth mirror region, which resulted from shear action that happened before plastic deformation.
In contrast, the fracture surface of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composite with 20 vol% Mo was
predominated by the well-developed vein patterns, as illustrated in Figure 6 (b). Meanwhile,
Figure 6(c) displays that some shear bands can be observed on the interface between Mo particle
and amorphous matrix. It implied that the Mo particles can originate or hinder shear bands. Shear
bands may not penetrate through the particles with ease, due to the strong bonding condition
between Mo and Mg-based matrix. Thus, the formation of multiple shear-bands accompanying
the plastic deformation of Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites is expected. The SEM image of
figure 6 (d) displays that the angle between the compressive direction and the maximum shear
surface of Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites with 20 vol% Mo was~ 45o.
The results of Vickers hardness indentation are summarized in Table 2. It exhibited that
hardness of the developed Mg-based BMG composites increased with increasing the Mo content.
Figure 7 shows the SEM images of Vickers indentation on Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites
with 20 vol% Mo particles under a static load of 20 Kg. It displayed that the radial cracks
emanated from the impression corners and the propagations of cracks were impeded by the
dispersed Mo particles. Furthermore, the extended cracks can be used to estimate fracture
toughness of the desired materials by using Vickers indentation fracture (VIF) technique. Several
equations for the VIF toughness evaluation have been reported. In this study, the determination of

Abstract
In this study, the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with superior glass
forming ability are made by Cu-mold casting and injection casting. The critical rod size of the
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMGs (base alloys) reached ~4 mm in diameter. The results of Vickers
indentation and compression tests of Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMGs reveal brittle fracture behavior
with ~0% plastic strain and the fracture toughness and the fracture strength of base alloy is ~9
MPa m1/2 and ~860 MPa, respectively. The SEM observation is followed after the mechanical
properties tests and it showed that the featureless mirror-like area is dominant in the fracture
surface. Besides, the nano-scaled striations are displayed inside the mirror-like region. For the
improvement of mechanical properties of the base alloy, the porous Mo particles are used to form
the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5-Mo BMG composites. The fracture toughness and fracture strength of
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 alloys with the addition of 30 vol.% Mo dispersion is promoted to ~50
MPa m1/2 and ~1100 MPa, respectively. The observation of the fracture surface of
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5-30 vol.% Mo BMG composite via the compression test reveals that the
shear bands and cracks propagation is resisted by the dispersion of Mo particles and secondary
shear bands are formed during the plastic deformation. It is also observed that the fracture surface

According to the previous reports, it was showed that the compressive strength and the impact
toughness of the Mg-based BMG composites were improved by the appearance of dispersion
strengthening mechanism.
The Mg58Cu31Y5Gd6 bulk metallic glass with high glass forming ability was selected as
the base alloy in this study. The present intent is to enhance the mechanical properties of
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMGs, such as strength, toughness and plastic strain, by adding the
second phase reinforcements. The adopted second phase particle, Mo, has great thermal
properties and high corrosion resistance, which is stable and immiscible with the Mg-based BMG
matrix. The effects of the second phase addition on the mechanical property of the brittle
Mg-based BMG composites are examined in this paper.
2. Experimental
Elemental materials (with purity ~99.9 at%) of Mg, Cu, Y, Nd and Ag were used in this
research. The Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG base alloys were made by arc melting and induction
melting method. The volume fractions of the adding Mo powders into the base alloy are 10, 15
and 20 vol%. During the induction melting process, the melted BMG composite with
homogeneous mixing of Mo powders was injected into the water-cooled Cu molds to form the
rods with the diameter in the range of 2~5 mm and the length of 5 cm. The vitrification of
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG base alloys and composites were examined by using X-ray
diffraction (Scintag X-400 diffractometer, with monochromatic Cu K radiation). Thermal
properties of Mg-based BMG composites were analyzed by differential scanning calorimeter (TA
instruments DSC 2920) at a heating rate of 20 K/min. The room temperature compression and
Vickers hardness tests (macro-Vickers hardness tester, Akashi MVK-H11) were performed to
evaluate the mechanical properties of Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMGs. The specimen size of
compression test was 2 mm in diameter and 4 mm in height. Microstructures of the developed
materials were analyzed by the field-emission scanning electric microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi
S-4700) and the transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G220 S-Twin TEM) carried out at
a strain rate of 5x10-4 s-1 to estimate the mechanical properties of the BMG composites. The size
30
includingTx(=Tx-Tg, the supercooled liquid regime), Trg(=Tg/Tl, Tg: glass transition temperature;
Tl: liquidus temperature),(=Tx/(Tg+Tl) and m (=(2Tx-Tg)/Tl). There is no distinct change of Tg
can be found with the addiing of the Mo particles. The Tx and the Tl decreased slightly with the
increasing of the Mo content, causing the worthless reduction of the GFA parameters, such as 
andm. The Mg-based BMG composites with the Mo dispersion maintained high thermal stability
and high GFA. This result corresponded with that of the XRD observation.
For the investigation of the mechanical properties for the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG
composites, the uniaxial compression tests were conducted at room temperature with a strain rate
of 5x10-4 s-1. Figure 5 reveals the true stress-strain curve of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG
composites with various contents of Mo particles via the compressive tests. Fracture stress (f),
elastic constant (E) and plastic strain (p) of the BMG composites were extracted from Figure 5
and summarized in Table 2. It is concluded that obvious plastic strain of the BMG composites
was obtained by the adding of Mo particles. The optimal fracture strength and plastic stain of the
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG composites with 20 vol% Mo content approached to 1 GPa and 29%,
which is higher than that of TiB2- or Nb-containing Mg-based BMG materials. The fracture
surfaces of the compressive specimens were examined by SEM and their morphology are shown
in Figure 6. Compressive failure mode of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 base alloy was brittle (with
~0% plastic stain, as shown in Table 2). Therefore, the feature of fracture morphology of the base
alloy (in Figure 6 (a)) was the smooth mirror region, which resulted from shear action that
happened before plastic deformation. In contrast, the fracture surface of the
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG composite with 30 vol% Mo was predominated by the
well-developed vein patterns, as illustrated in Figure 6 (b). Meanwhile, Figure 6(c) displays that
some shear bands can be observed on the interface between Mo particle and amorphous matrix. It
implied that the Mo particles can originate or hinder shear bands. Shear bands may not penetrate
through the particles with ease, due to the strong bonding condition between Mo and Mg-based
matrix. Thus, the formation of multiple shear-bands accompanying the plastic deformation of
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG composites is expected. The SEM image of figure 6 (d) displays
that the angle between the compressive direction and the maximum shear surface of
32
3. The well-developed vein patterns on the fracture surface are caused by dense dispersion of the
Mo particles in the amorphous matrix. Mechanical properties of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5
BMG composites increased with the increasing of Mo contents. In this stud, the optimal
fracture strength, plastic stain and fracture toughness of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG
composites with 30 vol% Mo particles reached about 1 GPa, 29% and 50 MPa m1/2,
respectively.

Abstract
The base alloys of Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) rods (~4 mm in diameter) with
high glass forming ability (GFA) and high thermal properties are made by injection casting. Vickers
indentation and compression test are performed for the mechanical properties measuring. It exhibits that
the fracture toughness of the base alloy is ~8 MPa m1/2 and the fracture behavior is brittle. For the
mechanical properties promotion, the Mo particles (10, 15, 20 vol%) are selected to be the additive in the
base alloy. Then the microstructure characterizations of the resulting BMG compositions are performed
by XRD and SEM analyses. No detrimental effect of the additive Mo particles is observed on the glass
forming ability of the base alloys. Besides, the result of the compressive test of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5-Mo
amorphous composite alloys reveals that the plastic strain is improved with the addition of Mo particles
(p ~6.2%) and the spread vein-patterns are formed on the fracture surface. The fracture toughness is also
improved. KIC of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 with 20 vol% Mo is ~25 MPa m1/2. SEM observation of BMG
composites reveals that the shear bands and the cracks propagation are impeded by the Mo particles and
the secondary shear bands are formed during the plastic deformation process. It indicated that the addition
of Mo particles for the plasticity improvement of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 alloy is contributive.
Introduction
In recent years, research of the structural materials, such as titanium, zirconium, copper,
aluminum and magnesium alloys, with high specific strength to density ratio has been aroused due to the
worldwide problems of resource shortage and environment contamination. The most well known
lightweight material is low cost and easy recycling Mg alloy systems (the specific weight for Mg is 1.7
g/cm3, for Al is 2.7 g/cm3 and for Ti is 4.5 g/cm3 respectively). Many efforts [1-4] have been strived for
the developments of Mg-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), especially for the Mg-Cu-RE (RE: rare
earth metal, such as Y, Gd, Nd and Tb) and Mg-Ni-RE alloy systems [5-8], because the Mg-based BMGs
possess high compressive fracture strength (~850 MPa) and good corrosion resistance, as compared with
the conventional Mg-based crystalline alloys. It was found that the Mg-TM-RE (TM: transition metal)
BMG rods [9,10] with high glass forming ability, large supercooled liquid region and 4-9 mm in diameter
properties of the BMG composites. The size of the compression testing specimen was 2 mm in diameter
and 4 mm in height. Fracture surfaces and microstructures of the desired alloy systems were observed by
the field-emission scanning electric microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4700).
Results and Discussions
Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 base alloy and the BMG composites with
the addition of 10, 15 and 20 vol% of Mo particles. Only a broadening peak was detected in the XRD
patterns of the base alloy, and it demonstrated that the structure of the base metal was fully amorphous
state. Besides, the XRD patterns of BMG composites revealed that no obvious crystalline phase can be
resolved on the broadening hump from the amorphous matrix except for the three sharp peaks diffracted
from the Mo particle. It means that the glassy structure of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 base alloys was
uninfluenced with the mixing of the Mo particles, because the bcc-Mo particle has positive mixing
enthalpy with the Mg-based BMG matrix. Figure 3 is the SEM images taken form the cross-section of the
Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 base alloy and the BMG composites rods. It is observed that the outside and the inside of
the porous Mo particles were filled with the Mg-based BMG alloy, indicating that the molten base
materials had good wetability with Mo powders. Hence, the bonding between the Mo particles and the
Mg-based BMG matrix was quite well and the dispersion of Mo powders in the BMG matrix was
homogeneously. Moreover, the variation of size and shape of the Mo particles was undetectable in Figure
3. Only little porosity was observed in the SEM images of the BMG composites.
In order to explore the additive effect of the Mo particles on the thermal properties, the glass
transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization temperature (Tx) and the melting temperature (Tl) of the
Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites were measured by DSC scans at a heating rate of 20 K/min.
Non-isothermal DSC traces for the BMG composites are shown in Figure 4. The thermal analysis results
are listed in Table 1, together with the estimated data, including Tx(=Tx-Tg, the supercooled liquid
regime), Trg(=Tg/Tl, Tg: glass transition temperature; Tl: liquidus temperature), (=Tx/(Tg+Tl) andm
(=(2Tx-Tg)/Tl). There is no distinct change of Tg can be found with the addiing of the Mo particles. The Tx
and the Tl decreased slightly with the increasing of the Mo content, causing the worthless reduction of the
GFA parameters, such asand m. The Mg-based BMG composites with the Mo dispersion maintained
high thermal stability and high GFA. This result corresponded with that of the XRD observation.
For the investigation of the mechanical properties for the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites, the
uniaxial compression tests were conducted at room temperature with a strain rate of 5x10-4 s-1. Figure 5
reveals the true stress-strain curve of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites with various contents of Mo
particles via the compressive tests. Fracture stress (f), elastic constant (E) and plastic strain (p) of the
BMG composites were extracted from Figure 5 and summarized in Table 2. It is concluded that obvious
plastic strain of the BMG composites was obtained by the adding of Mo particles. The optimal fracture
strength and plastic stain of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites with 20 vol% Mo content approached
to 1 GPa and 6.2%, which is higher than that of TiB2- or Nb-containing Mg-based BMG materials. The
fracture surfaces of the compressive specimens were examined by SEM and their morphology are shown
in Figure 6. Compressive failure mode of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 base alloy was brittle (with ~0% plastic
and fracture toughness of the Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG composites with 20 vol% Mo particles reached
about 1 GPa, 6.2% and 25 MPa m1/2, respectively.

1. Introduction
In recent years, research of the structural materials, such as titanium, zirconium, copper,
aluminum and magnesium alloys, with high specific strength to density ratio has been aroused due to the
worldwide problems of resource shortage and environment contamination. The most well known
lightweight material is Mg alloy systems (the specific weight for Mg is 1.7 g/cm3). Many efforts [1-4]
have been strived for the development of Mg-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), especially for the
Mg-Cu-RE (RE: rare earth metal, such as Y, Gd, Nd and Tb) alloy systems [5-8], because the Mg-based
BMGs possess high compressive fracture strength (~850 MPa) and good corrosion resistance, as
compared with the conventional Mg-based crystalline alloys. It was found that the Mg-Cu-RE (TM:
transition metal) BMG rods [9,10] with high glass forming ability, large supercooled liquid region and
large specimen size (reached to 4-9 mm in diameter) can be prepared by using copper mold casting
method at a low critical rate of about 102 K/s recently. However, the Mg-based BMGs show the low
ductility problems during the plastic deformation process. The formation of localized shear bands caused
the brittle failure mode of Mg-based BMGs and limited their application. In order to figure out this
problem, the researchers have demonstrated that ceramic or metallic powders can be regarded as the
reinforced particles dispersed in Zr-based [16] BMG matrix to retard the shear bands and the cracks
propagation and to form the multiple shear bands during plastic deformation. Following this concept,
many kinds of the Mg-based bulk metallic composites have been developed with the addition of
numerous kinds of the second phase particles (such as Fe, TiB2, ZrO2, WC, SiC, Nb, Mo and Ti) [17-22].
According to the previous reports, it was showed that the compressive strength and the impact toughness
of the Mg-based BMG composites were improved by the appearance of dispersion strengthening
mechanism.
The Mg58Cu31Y5Gd6 bulk metallic glass with high glass forming ability was selected as the base
The shape of the Mo powders is spherical with the porous structure and an average particle size is
in the range of 20 to 70 μm. The morphology of the Mo patricles is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 base alloy and the BMG composites
with the addition of 10, 15 and 20 vol% of Mo particles. Only a broadening peak was detected in the
XRD patterns of the base alloy, and it demonstrated that the structure of the base metal was fully
amorphous state. Besides, the XRD patterns of BMG composites revealed that no obvious crystalline
phase can be resolved on the broadening hump from the amorphous matrix except for the three sharp
peaks diffracted from the Mo particle. It means that the glassy structure of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 base
alloys was uninfluenced with the mixing of the Mo particles, because the bcc-Mo particle has positive
mixing enthalpy with the Mg-based BMG matrix. Figure 3 is the SEM images taken form the
cross-section of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 base alloy and the BMG composites rods. It is observed that
the outside and the inside of the porous Mo particles were filled with the Mg-based BMG alloy,
indicating that the molten base materials had good wetability with Mo powders. Hence, the bonding
between the Mo particles and the Mg-based BMG matrix was quite well and the dispersion of Mo
powders in the BMG matrix was homogeneously. Moreover, the variation of size and shape of the Mo
particles was undetectable in Figure 3. Only little porosity was observed in the SEM images of the BMG
composites.
In order to explore the additive effect of the Mo particles on the thermal properties, the glass
transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization temperature (Tx) and the melting temperature (Tl) of the
Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG composites were measured by DSC scans at a heating rate of 20 K/min.
Non-isothermal DSC traces for the BMG composites are shown in Figure 4. The thermal analysis results
are listed in Table 1, together with the estimated data, includingTx(=Tx-Tg, the supercooled liquid
regime), Trg(=Tg/Tl, Tg: glass transition temperature; Tl: liquidus temperature),(=Tx/(Tg+Tl) and m
(=(2Tx-Tg)/Tl). There is no distinct change of Tg can be found with the addiing of the Mo particles. The Tx
and the Tl decreased slightly with the increasing of the Mo content, causing the worthless reduction of the
GFA parameters, such as and m. The Mg-based BMG composites with the Mo dispersion maintained
high thermal stability and high GFA. This result corresponded with that of the XRD observation.
indentation fracture (VIF) technique. Several equations for the VIF toughness evaluation have been
reported. In this study, the determination of static fracture toughness, KIC, is based on following
approximation:
KIC= 0.016(E/H)0.5 P/(a1.5),
where E is theYoung’s modulusof the material, H is the hardness, P is the applied load and a is the
length of the radial cracks. Average fracture toughness of the desired materials was evaluated, as revealed
in Table 2. The fracture toughness of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG composites increased with the
increasing of Mo particles. This result tallied with the observation of compressive tests. The highest
fracture toughness of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG composites with 30 vol% Mo was calculated as
~50 MPa m1/2.
4. Conclusions
1. The chosen reinforcement of Mo particles is insoluble with the Mg-based BMGs. The addition of Mo
particles does not make the crystallization of Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMGs. Hence, a conventional
injection casting method can be used to fabricate the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG compositions
containing homogeneous dispersed Mo powders, which exhibited high glass forming ability.
2. The strong bonding condition between the porous Mo particles and the Mg-based BMG matrix was
established. The Mo particles retarded the shear bands and the cracks propagation in the BMG matrix.
Multiple shear bands are formed around Mo particles to the accompaniment of plastic deformation
process.
3. The well-developed vein patterns on the fracture surface are caused by dense dispersion of the Mo
particles in the amorphous matrix. Mechanical properties of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG
composites increased with the increasing of Mo contents. In this stud, the optimal fracture strength,
plastic stain and fracture toughness of the Mg58Cu29.5Y6Nd5Ag1.5 BMG composites with 30 vol% Mo
particles reached about 1 GPa, 29% and 50 MPa m1/2, respectively.
