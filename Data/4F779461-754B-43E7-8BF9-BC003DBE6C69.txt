INTRODUCTION 
Dioxins are considered among the most severe hazardous pollutants in environment. Among 
various dioxin emission sources, municipal waste incinerators are a major source because of high 
chloride content in municipal waste that can promote dioxins formation in the waste incineration 
process.  Currently there are six municipal waste incinerators operating in the Taipei 
metropolitan area, as listed in Table 1.  Residents’ exposure to dioxins emitted from those 
incinerators is a public concern.  Since the emitted dioxins may transport among various 
environmental media such as air, soil, water and sediment, the fate and transport of dioxins is 
needed for dioxin exposure risk assessment.  To predict the fate of the emitted dioxins, a fugacity 
model (Mackay 1991) that can simulate dioxin transport among the media is used in this study.  
Since dioxins include many congeners, one may normalize the individual congeners into 2,3,7,8-
TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQ), as described under the Results and Discussion section.

ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  
Multimedia Transport Model 
A fugacity model based on mass balance and equilibrium of pollutant partition among different 
media was used in this study to simulate the pollutant transport among multimedia as shown in 
Figure 1.  We considered four compartments, namely air, water, soil, and sediment.  The dioxins 
fate or dioxins concentration and accumulated mass in the four compartments were predicted by 
the fugacity model.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Dioxin Source Inventory 
Since dioxins include many congeners, one may normalize the congeners into 2,3,7,8-TCDD 
toxic equivalents(TEQ) with toxic equivalent factors (TEFs) of the individual congeners as listed 
in Table 4.  The (TEQ) is calculated by using the TEFs as shown in as equation (12)

2.) 
When compared with other countries, the predicted Taipei dioxins exposure dose is relatively 
lower, as shown in Table 6.   The dose rates shown in Table 6 were assumed to be averaged 
lifetime dose rate considering accumulation dose from childhood through adult.

CONCLUSION 
This assessment for human dioxins exposure risk to municipal waste incinerator’ emissions in 
the Taipei metropolitan area concludes the following findings: 
• Most dioxins were accumulated in soil（97.3％）followed by sediment （2.3％）.  There 
were less dioxins accumulated in water and air compared with soil and sediment. 
• Among all exposure pathways, intake is the major exposure pathway（94％）.  The second
