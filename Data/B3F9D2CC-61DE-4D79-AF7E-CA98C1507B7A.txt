Introduction 
Transport of Brownian particles and biomacromolecules through structures with 
spatially non-uniformity, such as pores and zeolites, is ubiquitous in physicochemical 
and biological systems. In general, it is a limiting mechanism in processes like 
catalysis and particle separation. Along the propagation direction, the shape of the 
confined structure varies due to irregular boundaries. As a consequence, the number 
of states that are available to the particles change accordingly.[1,2] Since entropy is 
spatially varying, transport in channels with variable cross sections evolves through 
"entropy barriers,"[2] which enhance or hamper mass transfer to certain regions. The 
entry of a particle into a narrow region can be associated with a particle 
size-dependent entropy reduction.³ This characteristic can be exploited for particle 
separations. 
    The separation of bioparticles such as proteins and polynucleotides is typically 
accomplished by gel electrophoresis. Recently, a promising alternative to random 
nanoporous gels, regular sieving nanostructures are proposed to improve the speed 
and resolution of biomacromolecule separation. By making use of semiconductor 
fabrication technology to create nanostructured matrices, a variety of microfabricated 
systems with periodically varying cross section have been developed to separate 
biomacromolecules effectively.[3-5] For example, a nanofluidic channel device 
consisting of alternating deep regions and shallow constrictions was successfully 
introduced to separate proteins of different molecular weights.³ Due to 
rapidly-developing microfluidic separation devices, there is an emerging theoretical 
interest in force-driven transport of Brownian particles through channels with periodic 
entropy barriers.[1,6-9] 
    An entropy barrier for finding the exit must be overcome for a Brownian particle 
to escape from a cavity through a window. When the hole is small, it has been pointed 
out that the escape is controlled by the entropy barrier and the survival probability 
decays as a single exponential in time even in the absence of a potential barrier.[2,10] 
When the hole radius is small compared to the cavity size, it is argued that the escape 
rate associated with a point Brownian particle can be expressed by k=4DRH/V, where 
RH and V denote the hole radius and the cavity volume, and D is the diffusivity of the 
particle.[10] Brownian dynamics simulations have been performed for spherical and 
cubic cavities and confirmed exponentially decaying survival-probability and the 
relation k∼RH.[10] 
    Brownian escape and force-driven transport in the presence of entropic barrier 
exhibit characteristics which are distinctly different from that occurring through 
potential energy barrier. In order to perform analytical analyses, previous studies often 
consider a point-sized Brownian particle escaping through a hole by diffusion[10] or 
    Note that in this study the hole radius is small compared to the cavity radius. 
Since the particle size is smaller than the hole size, it is always much smaller than 
cavity radius. Consequently, the hydrodynamic interactions between the particle and 
the walls are neglected. The boundary condition is employed by rejecting a move that 
results in the particle crossing the walls and increasing the time counter (i.e., a Monte 
Carlo-like move).[9] In addition to the excluded volume associated with a hard-sphere, 
the effect of the particle size is manifested by the friction coefficient, which is 
assumed to follow the Stokes' law, 
 γ=3πηa, 
 where η represents the fluid viscosity. According to Eq. (3), the size of the particle 
may influence the escape rate or drift velocity through its Brownian diffusivity, i.e., 
D∼a⁻¹. That is, a particle with smaller size diffuses faster than that with larger size 
and such an effect is manifested in FT through Eq. (5). To demonstrate the dependence 
of the entropic barrier (small hole) on the particle size, we assume that the externally 
applied force is proportional to the product of the particle size a and the uniform field 
E, i.e., FE∼aE. This assumption is similar to a particle carrying charges Q∼a under the 
electric field E. To eliminate the contribution to transport due to spatially nonuniform 
electric field adjusting to the varying geometry, however, the nonuniformity of the 
field is ignored. Our assumption results in the fact that the mobility of the particle is 
independent of its size in the absence of the periodic barrier (a channel with constant 
cross section). According to Eq. (1), one has <u>∼E/η, which is not size-dependent. 
In other words, the particle separation based on size differences in this study is purely 
attributed to the entropy barrier. 
    In the BD simulations, the dimensionless form of the overdamped Langevin 
equations are written as[11] 
 x’=x+((D/(D∗)))F
E⋅Δt+√(2((D/(D*)))Δt) Z, 
 where Z denotes a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. The 
position x, time t, and force FE are scaled by a∗, a∗
2/D∗, and kBT/a∗, respectively. Here 
D∗ denotes diffusivity of the particle with diameter a∗. Note that the diffusivity ratio is 
simply D(a)/D∗=a∗/a. Typically, the integration time step is Δt=2.5-4. For Brownian 
escape FE=0, the simulations were performed for at least 5000 trajectories with 
particles uniformly distributed in the cavity at t=0. The trajectory was terminated as 
soon as the particle escapes from the cavity through the window for the first time. The 
first passage time T was recorded and the escape rate was then determined by the 
mean first passage time, k=<T>-1. As to the force-driven transport, measurements of 
the mean drift velocity <u> are taken after translation at least 5000 periods under 
various constant forces. The average x-direction trajectory per cavity unit is almost 
linear with time and the mean drift velocity is calculated from the slope. The particle 
particle size comes into play, <T> must be a function of the size ratio of particle to 
hole as well, i.e., 0<a/RH<2. In other words, one expects a correction to <T>0 owing to 
the particle-size dependent exit effect, 
 <T>=(<T>0)/(f(a/RH), 
where the effect of particle size, f, can be determined by BD simulations and has to 
satisfy the two limiting conditions: f→1 as a/RH→0 and f→0 as a/RH→2. The 
dimensionless form of Eq. (10) is expressed by 
 <T>=(π/6)RC3(a/(RH)f⁻¹. 
    In order to examine the validity of Eqs. (9)-(11), we have to examine the 
dependence of <T> on RC (or cavity volume V) first. For simplicity, the caret 
associated with the dimensionless expression will be neglected in the following. 
Figure 2 illustrates the variation of the mean first passage time with the cavity radius 
for various Brownian particle size at RH=1. Since all the results associated with 
different particle sizes can be well represented by log<T>=3logRC+α’, one can 
conclude that <T>=α⋅RC3, which agrees with Eq. (11). Note that the constants α’ and 
α denote the exit effect and grow with increasing the particle size. To demonstrate the 
dependence of the exit effect on the particle size, the mean first passage time is 
plotted against the size ratio of particle to hole, a/RH, at a given cavity radius RC=10. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the data points associated with different values of a and RH 
collapse together if the ratio a/RH is the same. Moreover, as a/RH is increased toward 2, 
the mean first passage time grows rapidly. All data points can be well represented by 
the solid curve which has the expression, 
 <T>≅(π/6)RC3(a/RH)(1-(1/2)(a/RH))-3/2. 
 This result indicates that the particle-size dependent exit effect can be expressed by 
 f(x)≅(1-x/2)3/2, 
 where 0≤x<2. To further confirm the validity of Eq. (12), <T>/RC3 is plotted against 
a/RH for different values of RC, RH, and a. Figure 4 shows that all data points fall into 
a single curve obtained from Eq. (12) and demonstrates unambiguously the exit effect 
associated with the entropic barrier for Brownian escape. 
    The survival probability of a Brownian particle escaping from a cavity through a 
small window has been studied for a two-dimensional region bounded by four 
reflecting disks[2] and for three-dimensional spherical and cubic cavities.[10] It has 
been proved that when the hole is small, the kinetics of a point particle escape is 
dominated by an entropic barrier and the survival probability decays as a single 
exponential based on the spectral representation, i.e., an infinite sum of 
exponentials.[10] When the hole is small enough, all pre-exponential factors are small 
except that the first one is unity with a correction due to the hole with absorbing 
boundary condition. The disturbance to the ground state associated with the cavity
