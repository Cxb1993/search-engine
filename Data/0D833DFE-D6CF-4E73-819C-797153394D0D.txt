Abstract 
Owing to the rapid development in the 
opto-electronic and computer related industrials, parts 
such as moulds for plastic injection are frequently 
requested to be machined to a form accuracy of ?/2 
to ?/10. Besides, there are increasing demands for 
diffractive optics made of brittle materials such as Si 
and Ge, though excessive tool wear may be expected 
when diamond turned. The geometric error of tool, 
introduced by wear in the cutting process, has 
profound effect on the final products‘ form accuracy. 
If the tool wear is not detected and replaced in time, 
not only it may produce lots of parts of poor 
dimension accuracy but also the wear can get worse 
in an exponential manner. The expensive natural 
diamond tool will have to be discarded if the wear is 
beyond the limit of re-lapping work. Acoustic 
emission(AE) technique will be employed in this 
study to monitor the cutting condition and help 
deciding when to stop and do the checking on tool 
wear. A big part of the tool wear monitoring is done 
by using a contact probe such as LVDT. This is 
running the risk of damaging the delicate tool tip and 
has the ambiguity of exact tool/probe contact point. 
The optical/non-contact way of monitoring the tool 
do offer the advantage of not having to touch the tool, 
but its resolution is limited by the optical diffraction 
4 
However, these methods are not easily adapted in 
practical in-situ precision measurement application. 
The major problem for optical tool profile monitoring 
is that the achievable accuracy is limited by the 
resolution of the image system and this resolution is 
not quite sufficient for ultra-precision turning 
operation.  
There are many ways to improve the 
precision/resolution of the image measurement system, 
upgrading the image sensor is one of them. However, 
upgrading the hardware often means a big rise in cost 
and, very frequently, problems can not be solved 
merely by improving the hardware. Recently, efforts 
have been made to develop new image process 
algorithms to improve the precision of measuring 
system. [5-6] 
Object localization has always played a key role in 
image measurement system. It is designed to extract 
information from digital image and can be classified 
into two levels: pixel-level and subpixel-level 
detection. The pixel-level measurement can only 
localize edges to the nearest pixel. It has the 
advantage of fast in detecting edge but suffered by 
low in precision. Operators such as Canny, Laplacian 
of Gaussian (LOG) and Sobel are amongst those 
commonly used for pixel-level measurement.[7] The 
subpixel- level methods such as geometric, Legendre 
and Zernike moments, have the advantage of high 
precision but in the expense of long computation 
time.[8-13] A technique which combining the 
two-stage edge detection scheme has been reported to 
have the advantages of improving detection precision 
and shortening the run time. [14, 15] 
This paper presents an on-line/non-contact 
submicron-precision image measurement technique to 
be used in ultra-precision diamond turning operation. 
2. The optical image acquiring system 
Shown in Fig. 1 is the measuring system used in 
this study. The diamond tool is mounted on the tool 
holder and the CCD camera was vertically above the 
tool. A lighting pad was used as a light source to 
illuminate the tool. The CCD camera and frame 
grabber catch the tool image ),( yxf   which is 
subsequently analyzed using image processing 
technique. The image resolution used in the present 
study is in the order of 2.46 µm per pixel. This is too 
rough for the diamond turning operation. A two 
dimensional sub-pixel analyses technique was so 
adopted to determine the tool geometry.  
3. Object localization analysis techniques 
Upon acquiring the tool images, two different 
edge detection operators were used to calculate tool 
profile points based on an optimized threshold value. 
The Sobel operator was first used to detect tool profile 
to pixel-level precision, the Zernike operator was then 
used to refine the profile to the subpixel accuracy.  
 
3.1 Sobel operator [7] 
In comparison to other operators such as 
Laplacian and Canny, Sobel operator is relatively 
simple, fast computing and insensitive to noise. It is 
based on a pair of 3x3 convolution kernels (horizontal 
and vertical). The kernels are used to convolve with 
the input image and detect the horizontality and 
verticality gradients (Gx and Gy). Those kernels are 
given by:

The magnitude of the gradient at each point can be 
expressed as: 2 2( , )G x y Gx Gy= + . The pixel will 
be regarded as part of the tool profile if ( , )G x y  is 
large than the threshold value. These pixel-level 
“profile points” detected by Sobel operator have to be 
refined by Zernike moments operator. 
 
3.2 Zernike moments operator [15] 
Zernike function is a set of complex orthogonal 
functions which forms a complete orthogonal basis 
over the unit circle. The Zernike moment of order m 
with repetition n for a digital image ( , )f x y  is 
defined as follow: 
*1 ( , ) ( , )mn mn
x y
mZ f x y W r θπ
+= ∑∑  (3) 
where 2 2( ) 1x y+ ≤ , The Zernike 
polynomials ( , )mnW r θ of order m are defined as: 
( , ) ( ) jnmn mnW r R r e
θθ −=  (4) 
( )mnR r  is real radial polynomial which defined 
as:

(1) Acquiring the optimum threshold of the tool frame: 
the above mentioned optimum threshold value 
selecting scheme was used to automatically determine 
a threshold for the tool images 
(2) Extracting tool profile from image frame: 
Sobel operator is used to locate the tool profile to 
pixel level precision. The accuracy of the position is 
limited by the pixel size. 
(3) Locating profile position to subpixel precision: 
calculating Zernike moments for all points 
{ }1 1 2 2( , ), ( , ),....., ( , )n nx y x y x y on the profile and 
convolving these points with the Zernike masks of 
11Z  (the real component), 
'
11Z  (the imaginary 
component) and 20Z . 
4.3 Multi-frames tool shape detection (MFD) 
Two fundamental drawbacks of the SFD 
measuring technique are 1). small variation in position 
introduced by background noise cannot be avoided 
completely 2). information of single image frame is 
insufficient for correcting edge point. 
To rectify minor positioning errors, a centroid 
technique is used to recalculate the profile and to 
minimize disturbances caused by the variation of the 
optical fluctuation and insufficient information. The 
averaging technique was applied to a serial  of tool 
frames to improve accuracy. Let N  be the number 
of image frame and N/2 be the frame of object tool 
profile to be measured, _SFD iP  denote the curve of 
tool shape at image frame (i). The multiple frame tool 
shape MFDP  can then be written as the following 
equations:

4.4 Tool-tip Localization and pixel step fluctuation 
Those images of tool captured by CCD/frame 
grabber were stored in a computer for further 
processing. The sequence of tool images can be 
expressed as:  
( , ) ( ( ), ( ), )n n n nf x y f x t y t t=         (11) 
where the functional ( , ) ( ( ), ( ), )n n n nf x y f x t y t t=  is 
the nth sampled image captured at step t of stage 
movement. All acquired images were then processed 
with Canny operator to locate the profile in camera 
coordinates (pixel locations). The tool edge detection 
by Canny operator can be represented as: 
( , ) [ ( , ), , ]n nE x y C f x y T σ=          (12) 
where T is the upper threshold and ? is the 
Gaussian parameter for Canny edge detection. In this 
study, the value? is 1.0 and the lower threshold for 
finer edges used is 0.4T.  
After the tool edge maps have been extracted, the key 
issue followed was to decide the tip position. 
Depending on which way the stage is moving, the tool 
tip can be defined as the top-most pixel which has the 
maximum or minimum value of the Y axis. The 
sequence of tip points ( , )nTP x y  produced from 
tool images are shown in Fig.3 and calculated by: 
( , ) ( ( , ))n nTP x y Top E x y=           (13)

4.5 Precision improvement using Zernike moments 
To further improve the setting precision, a 
moment-based operator was then used to determine 
the location of tip point. In this study, the Zernike 
convolution mask is designed to be 7 by 7. Generally 
speaking, using a larger mask size has the advantage 
of reducing noise. However, this will increase the 
computational load.  
Masks of 11Z (the real component), 
'
11Z (the 
imaginary component) and 20Z  were designed based 
on method suggested by Qu et al[17]. For each tip 
point ( , )nTP x y , place Zernike masks to center at 
the tip point and compute the Zernike moments. 
According to Eq.3, tip point with sub-pixel accuracy 
is determined by:

4.6 Refine the tip position from step fluctuation 
The precision of an ultra-precision diamond 
turning machine, at present time, is normally in the 
order of 1~10nm. The resolution of a CCD optical 
measuring system, is typically around 1~10µm. 
Owing to the large discrepancy between the digital 
image system and the precision positioning stage, the 
digital image system is relatively insensitive to stage 
steps and can only respond when the movement has 
built up and reached a critical value. This means that 
there is a step-like displacement shown by the pixels 
over the stage step.  
The pixel step is greatly influenced by fluctuation 
due to the noise introduced by the optical effects such 
as lighting system, vibration and diffraction etc. These 
effects are usually worsened when approaching each 
switching point where tool tip is moving across to 
another pixel. Fig. 4 is the fluctuation of tool-tip 
movement shown by the pixels. Because of CCD

microscopic view.  
Shown in Fig. 9 were the detailed view of the 
profiles, representing a small segment of the diamond 
tool, generated by the SFD and MFD detection 
method. Note that SFD profile had small fluctuation 
on the detected profile map due to the noise and the 
insufficient information. 
The detected profile was then compared with the 
modified profile data measured by the Form Talysurf 
(Fig. 10). Though certain details were missing in the 
MFD-generated profile, the general trend of the 
profiles were in good agreement. 
Shown in Fig. 11 and Fig.12 were the SEM 
micrograph and the comparison between the 
MFD-generated profile and profile measured by Form 
Talysurf respectively. Again, the results showed good 
agreement with the profile data obtained by SEM 
micrographs and data measured by the precision 
profilometer (Form Talysurf).

3 Results and discussion 
The moment based tool shape detect algorithm has been applied to measure the profile of a diamond tool. Shown in the Fig. 1 is the 
detected tool shape and it appears to be a combination of small pieces of line segments and some fluctuations caused by the noises. 
The fitting curve shows the result of baseline with the least square technique to average out these noises. Shown in Fig. 2 is a 
comparison between profile-offsets (wear) obtained by the SFD(single-frames tool shape detection) and MFD(multi-frames tool shape 
detection) method upon the same diamond tool. The results of the SFD method still have subpixel-level variation along with the 
detected profile map due to the insufficient information in single image frame. MFD technique was adopted here to average out the 
subpixel-level noise and proved to be effective in improving the measurement accuracy. Theoretically, a large amount of image frame 
can compensate the negative effects of noise and lower the shape fluctuation.
