Abstract 
    The TiO to anatase phase transformation has been studied by transmission electron microscopy 
in this report.  It is shown that prior formation of TiO from Ti film can induce the formation of 
anatase by thermal oxidation in air, otherwise only rutile is formed.  Ti film deposited on the NaCl 
(001) surface is induced to form epitaxial TiO film by thermal oxidation in air.  Further thermal 
oxidation in air partially transformed TiO into anatase (A) with a parallel orientation relationship of 
{200}A // {200}TiO.  Detailed analysis of the lattice fringes image of the specimen reveals the 
presence of very high density of misfit dislocations.  The TiO to anatase transformation is 
reversible as further annealing in vacuum can turn the anatase back into TiO and eliminates the 
misfit dislocations.  The transformation is analyzed in terms of the crystal structure, orientation 
relationship, and the dislocation distribution, which show that the TiO to anatase transformation is 
due to the close similarity between their structures. 
 
1. Introduction 
TiO2 is a wide band gap (~3.2 eV) semiconductor and mainly exists in anatase and rutile 
polymorphic phases; both of which are tetragonal lattice.  Their structures can be depicted as 
differently-interconnected TiO6 octahedra chains resulting in significantly different unit cells and 
physical as well as chemical properties.1,2  The optoelectronic and photochemical properties such as 
photocatalytic activity are affected by its phase structure (anatase or rutile) and particle size.3,4  At 
ambient temperatures and pressures the rutile phase is the thermodynamically-stable phase of TiO2.5  
However, the metastable phase of anatase also attracts a lot of interests because of its wide 
applications and its better photocatalytic activity.6-8  Anatase has a lower average surface free energy 
(~1.3 J/m2) than rutile (~1.9 J/m2) and is stable at small particle size.9,10 
 
In addition to traditional applications in white pigments and paints, novel applications are being 
discovered for nanoscale TiO2.  For instance, nanocrystalline anatase plays a critical role in devices 
including dye-sensitized solar cells,11 photochemically degrade toxic chemicals,12 promising electrode 
material in lithium batteries,13,14 and as a photo-catalyst with promising efficiency.  These devices 
are based on highly porous films of nanocrystalline anatase with very large surface area, but their 
applications are limited by the difficulty in synthesizing pure anatase films via conventionally simple 
and cheap thermal oxidation method.  Experimentally, TiO2 thin films are generally prepared by 
deposition methods such as laser ablation, plasma sputtering or ion beam sputtering.15-19  Thin films 
of amorphous TiO2, anatase, rutile or a mixture of them can be obtained depending on particle energy, 
processing temperature and oxygen partial pressure. 
 
Previous results indicate that TiO and anatase generally do not form by thermal oxidation of Ti 
thin films in air.20,21  Thermal oxidation of Ti film in air below 550 ºC shows no phase change.  
Rutile appears at 550 ºC along with a metastable Ti2O phase, which then transforms into rutile at 700 
ºC.21  It was found that the Ti film (0002) texture promotes the growth of rutile (200) texture, 
although amorphous or low-crystallinity Ti films results in only randomly-distributed rutile.22  A

phase transformation between TiO and anatase.  It is fair to say that every step of the present 
research depends on the NaCl substrate.  The grain distribution, orientation relationship, and misfit 
dislocation distribution of anatase and TiO will be analyzed to study the mechanism of the TiO to 
anatase transformation.  
 
2. Experimental Methods 
Ti thin film was prepared by radio-frequency ion beam sputtering of Ti target on the (001) 
cleavage surface of NaCl single crystal.  The cleaved surface was first rinsed in distilled water and, 
after drying, exposed to chlorine gas for 5 min.30  The target was a 7.5 cm diameter, 99.99% Ti disk 
and the deposition conditions were 700 V applied voltage, 400 ºC substrate temperature, and 25 min 
deposition time in a vacuum of 4x10-4 Torr.  Before deposition, the target was pre-sputtered in argon 
for 20 min.  The prepared specimen thickness was about 10 nm. 
 
Two groups of specimens were tested in this research.  In the first group of one-step thermal 
oxidation, the Ti films were thermally oxidized in air at 400 ºC for 1 h or 375 ºC for 48 h to form 
rutile.  In the second group of two-steps thermal oxidation, the Ti thin films were thermally oxidized 
in air at 350 ºC for 1 h in the first-stage oxidation to transform into epitaxial TiO nanofilms, which 
were then thermally oxidized in air in the second-stage oxidation at 400ºC for 1 h or 375 ºC for 48 h 
to form anatase.  The specimens were then immersed in distilled water to dissolve the NaCl substrate 
and let the thin film floating on the water surface.  TEM specimens were prepared by picking up the 
thin film from under with copper grids covered with a carbon-coated collodion film (commercially 
available) by using a tweezer.  A field emission TEM (FEI Technai G2 F20, operated at 200 kV) was 
used and selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern, bright field image (BFI), and dark field image (DFI) 
were applied to study the microstructure of the thin film.  Lattice fringes image, Fourier 
transformation (FT) and inverse Fourier transformation (IFT) were used to analyze the microstructure 
in detail. 
 
The composition of the film was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, JEOL 
JPS-9010 MX ESCA) using an electronic spectrometer with Mg kα (1253.6 eV) X-ray source and an 
energy resolution of 0.5 eV.  Surface carbon was used to calibrate the bonding energy of C 1s to 
284.5 eV. 
 
3. Results  
3.1 Formation of TiO and anatase 
In the two-steps process, the first-stage thermal oxidation of the Ti thin film on the NaCl (001) 
surface at 350 ºC for 1 h in air turns it completely into epitaxial TiO nanofilm.  The SAD pattern of 
Fig. 1a shows that the TiO nanograins are well aligned and has a parallel orientation relationship of 
[001]TiO // [001]NaCl (zone axis), and (200)TiO // (200)NaCl.  The BFI in Fig. 1b, taken after removing 
completely the NaCl substrate, indicates that the TiO film is uniform and continuous.  The DFI of 
Fig. 1c using the (200)TiO spot shows that the TiO thin film has crystallites about 10 nm in size.  The 
 5 
 
Fig. 5a is the lattice fringe image of the specimen in Fig. 3a and Fig. 5b is the two-dimensional 
FT of Fig. 5a showing the presence of both the anatase and TiO spots, similar to that in Fig. 3a.  Fig. 
5c is the reconstructed lattice fringe image by IFT using the (020)TiO, (020)A, ( 020 )TiO, ( 020 )A spots 
and the central spot in Fig. 5b, so is Fig. 5d using the (200)TiO, (200)A, ( 002 )TiO, ( 002 )A spots and the 
central spot.  The purpose of these reconstructions is to make it easier to locate the dislocations.  As 
shown in the figures, the dislocations are all edge dislocation and their positions and extra planes are 
marked.  Fig. 5e is the reconstructed image by IFT using all the diffraction spots and the central spot, 
and is equivalent to the sum of Fig. 5c and Fig. 5d.  Another example from other area of the 
annealed film is shown in Figs. 5f and 5g.  From Figs. 5e and 5g, it is clear that the thin film has 
many edge dislocations after thermal oxidation, much more than those of the original TiO film which 
has few dislocations (Figs. 1f and 1g).  The overall dislocation density is very high, approximately 
3.39x1013 cm-2, more than those of heavily cold-worked metallic materials.33 
 
The XPS spectrum of the specimen in Fig. 3a was obtained after sputter-cleaning the surface 
with a 3 KeV Ar+ ion beam for 30 s to remove any surface contamination.  Before cleaning, a carbon 
1s peak was observed at 284.5 eV binding energy due to the organic surface contamination when the 
sample was exposed to air.  The Ti 2p1/2, Ti 2p3/2 and O 1s core-level spectra of TiO and anatase are 
shown in Figs. 6a and 6b, respectively.  The O/Ti atomic ratio is calculated to be 1.49 from the XPS 
peak area using relative sensitivity factor.34 
 
    To test the reversibility of the TiO to anatase transformation, the two-steps thermally oxidized 
specimen in Fig. 3a is further annealed in a vacuum of 2x10-5 Torr at 375 ºC for 12 h.  Fig. 7a shows 
that the anatase diffraction spots have nearly all disappeared and only the TiO diffraction spots remain.  
The diffraction pattern becomes the same as that in Fig. 1a, indicating that all anatase has turned back 
into TiO, i.e. the process is reversible.  The lattice fringe image in Fig. 7b also shows that the dense 
dislocations in Figs. 5e and 5g have also nearly completely disappeared and the thin film is again free 
of dislocation just as the TiO specimen in Fig. 1 before thermal oxidation. 
 
4. Discussion   
4.1.  Formation of anatase by prior formation of TiO.   
It was reported that no TiO forms and Ti remains unchanged for Ti film deposited on glass after 
thermal oxidation below 550 ºC in air.21  However, in this experiment epitaxial TiO film is shown to 
form on the NaCl (001) surface after first-stage thermal oxidation of Ti film at 350 ºC for 1 h in air.  
Apparently, TiO is facilitated to form by the epitaxial relationship with NaCl (001) surface, probably 
because TiO has the same structure as NaCl (B1 structure).  Further second-stage thermal oxidation 
at 400 ºC for 1 h or 375 ºC for 48 h in air turns TiO partially into anatase (Figs. 2a, 3a), while rutile 
forms under the same conditions without the prior formation of TiO (Figs. 2b and 3b).  Therefore, 
the prior formation of TiO is essential for the formation of anatase.

generally do not overlap. 
 
TiO and anatase grains are shown to be randomly distributed and are about 10 nm in size in the 
DFIs of Figs. 4b and 4c.  The SAD pattern of Fig. 3a shows that the (200)A and (020)A planes are 
parallel to the (200)TiO and (020)TiO planes, respectively.  Since the d-spacing of (200)A is 0.1893 nm 
and that of (200)TiO is 0.2089 nm, it takes eleven (200)A planes (2.0823 nm) to be nearly equal to the 
length of ten (200)TiO planes (2.089 nm).  Therefore a misfit dislocation is expected to be present 
about every ten TiO (200) planes if the unconstrained misfit strain is to be nearly completely relieved 
and the extra half plane is expected to lie in the anatase side.  However, since the minimum 
free-energy may be reached by a combination of partially-relieved strain energy and some misfit 
dislocations,35 the misfit strain energy may not necessarily be fully relaxed.  It is also to be noted that 
although the region immediately below the extra plane of the misfit dislocation should be TiO at the 
time when the misfit dislocation is formed, the region can still transform into anatase later with 
another misfit dislocation formed somewhere nearby.  Figs. 1f and 1g show that the original TiO 
film is nearly dislocation-free whereas Figs. 5e and 5g show that as the TiO film is partially oxidized 
to anatase the film has many misfit dislocations.  Calculation shows that the dislocation density is 
extremely high, reaching about 1013 cm-2, for the composite film. 
 
The above discussion shows that anatase and TiO do not overlap in the thin film and occupy 
separate regions of the film.  Fig. 3a shows that the diffraction spots of (200)A and (200)TiO are well 
separated and the difference is about 10%.  However, the lattice fringe images in Fig. 5 show the 
regions of TiO and anatase cannot be readily distinguished as there is no clear boundary between them.  
The size of TiO and anatase in the DFIs in Figs. 4b and 4c is approximately 10 nm, which is 
consistent with the size of the regions that are dislocation-free or full of dislocations in Fig. 5.  Since 
the original TiO has few dislocations (Fig. 1), it is inferred that the region free of dislocation should 
be TiO, as indicated in Figs. 5e and 5g, and the region containing many dislocations should be 
anatase. 
 
Although there is a 10% difference in unconstrained plane spacing, direct measurement of the 
spacings of lattice fringes is not useful to distinguish TiO from anatase.  The local stress below the 
dislocation extra plane is tensile and that near the extra plane is compressive, which distorts the lattice 
fringes locally.  Furthermore, in our TEM the best lattice fringe images can be taken at a 
magnification of 950,000 on a 2048 x 2048 digital plate so that the resolution is 0.021 nm per pixel.  
The spacing difference between (200)A and (200)TiO fringes is 0.0196 nm, which corresponds to only a 
single pixel.  Therefore TiO and anatase can not be resolved by the width between any two fringes 
due to the insufficient accuracy.  However, in regions free of dislocation the fringe spacing is 
uniform and can be reliably measured by averaging over ten fringes, which improves the accuracy by 
an order of magnitude.  The measured spacing agrees with that of the (200)TiO plane, which further 
confirms that the dislocation-free regions in Figs. 5e and 5g are really TiO regions.
