A family of minimum mean square error multiuser
detectors for three-domain spread multi-carrier direct
sequence-code division multiple access

Abstract: This study presents a family of multiuser detectors (MUDs) for the uplink of spatial-frequency-time-domain
(SFT-domain) spread, multi-carrier, direct sequence code division multiple access systems. More speciﬁcally, the family
is comprised of a joint SFT MUD and six separate MUDs. The proposed joint SFT MUD achieves a signiﬁcant
performance gain because it is based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) decision criteria. For practical realisation,
the main contribution of the study is that the authors further reduce the computational complexity by decomposing the
complete received signal into several low-dimension signal components and implementing the corresponding separate
MMSE MUDs to facilitate symbol detection. The authors also analyse the computational complexity and mean square
error bound of the proposed MUDs. The results of simulations demonstrate that the joint SFT MMSE MUD outperforms
the other proposed schemes; however, it requires the largest amount of computation. Meanwhile, the performance of the
separate MMSE MUDs is effective and close to that of the joint SFT MMSE MUD, but the computational overhead is
modest.
1 Introduction
As the demand for better quality of service (QoS) in
wireless communications continues to increase, there is an
urgent need to develop advanced techniques that enhance
the capacity and transmission reliability of wireless
communications. A number of studies have addressed
the issue in recent years [1–3]. It has been shown that
combining multi-carrier (MC) direct sequence-code
division multiple access (DS-CDMA) with the MC
schemes of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) and the time-domain (T-domain) signature codes
of DS-CDMA provides a number of beneﬁts, such as
high spectral efﬁciency and robustness to channel fading;
hence, they are considered promising candidates for future
wireless communications [4–7]. To increase the capacity
of MC DS-CDMA systems, a two-domain (2D) spreading
scheme, in which the transmitted signals are spread in
both the frequency-domain (F-domain) and the T-domain,
is proposed in [8, 9]. In this paper, we refer to the above
2D scheme as FT-domain spread MC DS-CDMA. As the
scheme exploits the F-domain and T-domain signature
codes, it has several merits for practical implementation,
including high ﬂexibility for variable rate services, short
T-domain and F-domain signature codes and a low
chip rate, which facilitate low-rate signal processing
[10–12]. It has also been shown that multiple antenna
techniques provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts for wireless
communications because of their spatial diversity and
antenna array gain [13–15]. Therefore to further enhance
QoS in wireless communications, it is vital that (i)
multiple antenna mechanisms are incorporated into
FT-domain spread MC DS-CDMAs; and (ii) relevant
advanced techniques like channel estimation and symbol
detection are developed. To date, these areas have
attracted comparatively little attention in the research
community.
Like CDMA systems, the performance of FT-domain
spread MC DS-CDMA systems is affected by multiple
access interference (MAI), which is caused by the non-
orthogonality of users’ signature codes or the impairment
of multipath fading channels [9–12]. It has been shown
that multiuser detectors (MUDs) [16] have the potential to
mitigate MAI. The maximum likelihood scheme is the
optimum MUD, but its computational complexity increases
exponentially with the number of users. Hence, several
suboptimal schemes have been proposed for practical
implementation, for example, parallel interference
cancellation (PIC) [17], successive interference cancellation
(SIC) [18], decorrelating detector (DD) [19] and minimum
mean square error (MMSE) detector [20]. Owing to their
superior performance and signiﬁcant capacity enhancement,
MMSE schemes have attracted more attention than other
suboptimal schemes [15, 20–23]. To address the MAI
issue in FT-domain spread MC DS-CDMA systems, Yang
et al. [10] proposed two joint FT-domain MUDs based on
the MMSE and the DD decision criteria; and to reduce the
computational complexity of the joint FT-domain schemes,

AWGN vector. For brevity, we also denote
cFTk,m = f˜ k,m ⊗ tk as the effective FT-domain signature
vector of the mth receive antenna for user k. In the same
manner as (2), the complete MNf Nt × 1 received signal,
r, can be obtained by stacking the M FT-domain received
signal vectors, rm, 1 ≤ m ≤ M, as follows

is the effective SFT-domain signature vector for user k; and
n is the total AWGN vector. Note that ak,m, 1 ≤ m ≤ M in
(3) is the mth antenna response for user k. Therefore the
S-domain signature vector for user k is expressed as
ak ¼ [ak,1 ak,2. . .ak,M]′.
3 Proposed schemes
In this section, we introduce the joint approach, called SFT-
domain MMSE MUD, for 3D spread MC DS-CDMA,
which always needs to compute the inverse of a huge
matrix for symbol detection; hence, the computational
overhead is prohibitive. To reduce the computational
complexity, we propose six separate MMSE MUDs to
decompose the complete received 3D signal into lower-
dimension signal components, say 1D or 2D. We then
apply the corresponding separate MMSE detectors of the
proposed MUDs to estimate the transmitted symbols. To
simplify the description of the algorithm and without loss
of the generality, we denote user j as the desired user. Thus,
the following derivations of the proposed schemes are for
user j.
3.1 Joint SFT-domain MMSE MUD
According to (3) and based on the MMSE decision criteria,
the joint SFT-domain MMSE MUD for the jth user can be
formulated as follows
wSFTj = argmin
wSFT
E[|bj − wSFT
H
r|2], 1 ≤ j ≤ K (4)
where (.)H and E[.] are the Hermititian and expectation
operations, respectively; After some manipulation, the
solution to (4) can be derived easily as
wSFTj = (E[rrH ])−1(E[rbj]), 1 ≤ j ≤ K

From (5), we observe that to implement the joint SFT-domain
MMSE MUD, wSFTj , we must compute the inverse of a huge
MNf Nt × MNf Nt matrix; however, the computational
overhead is usually prohibitive. The proposed separate
MMSE MUDs, which we discuss in the following sub-
sections, are designed to reduce the computational load. We
discuss them in the following sub-sections.
3.2 Separate MMSE MUDs
The rationale for building separate MMSE MUDs is to
cascade two kinds of low-complexity MMSE detectors,
namely 1D MMSE detectors and 2D MMSE detectors. In
addition, the complete received signals are decomposed into
lower dimension components as inputs for the ﬁrst-stage
MMSE detectors of the separate MMSE MUDs. Then, we
combine the outputs of those detectors to form a tentative
signal as the input for the next stage’s MMSE detectors.
As the received signal is processed successively by two
low-complexity MMSE detectors, the computational load
can be substantially reduced.
3.2.1 T-SF-domain MMSE MUD: This scheme utilises
the T-domain and the SF-domain MMSE detectors to
construct the overall T-SF-domain MMSE MUD. The
structure of the proposed T-SF-domain MMSE MUD for
user j is shown in Fig. 1. First, using the T-domain signal
rmi in (1) as the input for the considered MUD, the

user j

for notational simplicity. Finally, the estimated symbol for
user j can be derived by bˆj = sgn(w
^S
H
j r
^
j). Because (11) and
(13) are used to construct the overall FT-S-domain MMSE
MUD, we need to compute the inverses of the
M NfNt × NfNt matrices and the K M × M matrices
3.2.3. F-ST-domain MMSE MUD: To construct the
F-ST-domain MMSE MUD and the SF-T-domain MMSE
MUD, we re-stack the complete received signals. First, we
combine the Nf F-domain chip signals of the lth T-domain
chip duration and the mth receive antenna given by

Recall that, according to (2), f˜ k,m = diag{hk,m1, hk,m2, . . . ,
hk,mNf }f k,m. vml is the corresponding Nf × 1 AWGN vector.
Here, similar to (1) and (2), we combine the F-domain
vectors of all the M antennas, xml, as the SF-domain
received signal of the lth chip duration, expressed as
xl = [x′1lx′2l · · · x′Ml]′, 1 ≤ l ≤ Nt

is the effective SF-domain signature vector for user k. Note
that (14) and (15) can be used as the input signals for the
F-ST-domain MUD and the SF-T-domain MUD respectively.
For the F-ST-domain MUD, with the help of (14), the
corresponding ﬁrst-stage detector, that is, the F-domain
MMSE detector, of the lth chip duration and the mth
antenna can be expressed as
wFj,ml = argmin

Note that we use (16) and (19) to form the F-ST-domain
MMSE MUD; hence, we need to compute the inverses of
the MNt Nf × Nf matrices and the K MNt × MNt matrices.
3.2.4 SF-T-domain MMSE MUD: Similar to the above
F-ST-domain MMSE MUD and using (15), we construct
the SF-T-domain MMSE MUD and the corresponding
SF-domain detectors of the lth time chip as follows

3.2.6 ST-F-domain MMSE MUD: For the ST-F-domain

the ST-domain MMSE detector of subcarrier i can be

4 MSE performance and complexity analysis
4.1 MSE performance
In this subsection, we derive the performance of the MSE
of the joint SFT-domain MMSE MUD as the benchmark
for all proposed MUDs. First, we combine the SFT-domain
MMSE detectors, wSFTj , j ¼ 1, . . . , K in (5) to deﬁne the
weighting matrix, WSFT, as follows
W SFT = [wSFT1 wSFT2 · · ·wSFTK ] = (CSFTPCSFT
H
+ s2IMNf Nt )
−1CSFTP(1/2) (31)
where CSFT = [cSFT1 cSFT2 · · · cSFTK ] and P ¼ diag{p1, p2, . . . ,
pK} are the effective SFT-domain signature and the
transmission power matrices respectively. Then, for the
derivation of the MSE of the joint SFT-domain MMSE
MUD, the corresponding detection error vector e is deﬁned as
e = b− bˆ = b−W SFTH r (32)
where b = [b1, b2, . . . , bK ]′ and bˆ is the estimate of b.
Then, the error covariance matrix Re of the detection error
vector e can be written as
Re = E{eeH} = IK − E{brH}W SFT −W SFT
H
E{rbT}
+W SFTH E{rrH}W SFT (33)
Substituting (3) and (31) into (33), and after some
manipulation, we can re-express the error matrix as follows
Re = IK − P(1/2)CSFT
H
W SFT (34)
Then, the overall average MSE of K users is given by [5]
MSE = 1

Note that (35) is the MSE result of the joint SFT-domain
MMSE MUD. Furthermore, because the signals for the
inputs of the 1D(2D) MMSE detectors are different, the
MSE analysis of the proposed separated schemes is very
complicated. This implies that deriving the corresponding
compact vector-matrix forms of the MSE results is also
very difﬁcult. Hence, (35) is used as the MSE bound for
the proposed separate MMSE MUDs. To gain more insight
into the MSE results of the proposed schemes, we consider
two system settings, (K ¼ 20, M ¼ 6, Nf ¼ 8, Nt ¼ 16) and
(K ¼ 80, M ¼ 6, Nf ¼8, Nt ¼ 16). The corresponding MSE
results of the proposed schemes are shown in Figs. 3 and 4.
The curves for (35) are also shown in the ﬁgures as the
corresponding theoretical MSE bounds. From Fig. 3, we
observe that the simulation result of the joint SFT-domain
MMSE scheme is almost the same as the analysis result
derived by (35). In addition, the MSE simulation results of
the separate MMSE schemes are close to that of the joint
SFT-domain MMSE MUD. Therefore the equation can be
used as the theoretical MSE bound for the proposed
schemes. In Fig. 4, we replace the number of users K ¼ 20
by K ¼ 80. The values of the other settings are the same
as those in Fig. 3. As a result, the MAI effect becomes
stronger, so the MSEs of all the proposed schemes increase.
Moreover, Fig. 4 shows that the analysis result derived by
(35) can still be used as the theoretical MSE bound.
4.2 Complexity analysis
Next, we evaluate the proposed MUDs in terms of their
computational complexity based on the number of complex
multiplications/additions (CMAs) required [27]. In general,

separating the received signal to reduce the dimensions of the
corresponding matrices. Note that the FT-S-domain and S-
FT-domain MMSE MUDs need more computations than
the other MMSE MUDs; however, the simulation results
reported in the next section demonstrate that they achieve a
better performance.
5 Simulations and discussion
In this section, we discuss the results of simulations
conducted to assess the performance of the proposed
schemes. Assume that the channels for all users are
frequency selective Rayleigh slow fading and all the
channel information and signature codes are available at
the base station. The base station’s receiver is deployed
with M ¼ 6 antenna elements. For simplicity, all users
simultaneously transmit BPSK modulated symbols, which
are spread according to their own T-domain and F-domain
codes via the channels to the base station. Moreover, it is
assumed that the ISI effect is negligible and can be ignored.
We consider two groups of users, K ¼ 20 and K ¼ 80,
to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes in
different scenarios. In each scenario, we test two
combinations of the lengths of the T-domain and F-domain
signature codes of each user; speciﬁcally, we test Nt ¼ 16,
Nf ¼ 8 and Nt ¼ 8, Nf ¼ 16. The results for the BER
performance against the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
proposed schemes are shown in Figs. 6–9.
In Fig. 6, the simulation proﬁle is K ¼ 20, M ¼ 6, Nf ¼ 8,
Nt ¼ 16. We observe that the proposed SFT-domain MMSE
MUD outperforms the six separate MMSE MUDs.
However, the performance of the six MUDs is still close to
that of the SFT-domain MMSE MUD. Note that the
performance of the FT-S-domain and the S-FT-domain
MMSE MUDs is almost the same as that of the SFT-
domain MMSE MUD. They also perform slightly better
than the other four separate MMSE MUDs. This is because
the degree of freedom of the signal space provided by
the FT-domain MMSE detectors in the FT-S-domain and
S-FT-domain MMSE MUDs is Nf × Nt ¼ 128, which is
larger than that of the 2D MMSE detectors of the other four
separate MMSE MUDs. In addition, the FT-S-domain
MMSE MUD outperforms the S-FT-domain MMSE MUD
because it constructs the FT-domain MMSE detector ﬁrst,
which reduces the effect of MAI. As a result, the S-domain

MMSE MUDs outperform the other four separate MMSE
MUDs.
6 Concluding remarks
In this paper, we have proposed a family of MMSE MUDs
for the uplink of spatial-frequency-time-domain spread MC
DS-CDMA systems. To mitigate the effect of MAI in MC
DS-CDMA systems, we propose the joint SFT-domain
MMSE MUD. Furthermore, to reduce the computational
overhead for practical implementations, we introduce six
separate MMSE MUDs. We also analyse the performance
and conduct simulations to provide further insights into the
new schemes. As a whole, in light of the simulation results
and the computational complexity, the proposed joint SFT-
domain MMSE MUD achieves the best performance, but it
requires the largest amount of computation. The proposed
separate MMSE MUDs provide an appealing alternative
because their performance is close to that of the joint
scheme, and their computational overhead is modest. In our
future work, we will consider other approaches, such as that
in [28], to further enhance the performance of the schemes
proposed in this paper.

Antenna combining and power allocation-assisted
multiple-input multiple-output cooperative
communications: a joint approach

Abstract: In this study, the authors present a particle swarm optimisation (PSO) scheme for the joint issue of antenna combing
(AC) and power allocation in order to concurrently enhance throughput and reduce hardware cost for multiple-input multiple-
output cooperative systems. In the proposed scheme, each particle’s position is characterised by three matrices: the receive
AC matrix of the cooperative relay; the receive AC matrix of the destination node; and the power allocation matrix of the
cooperative relay. Based on the constrained maximisation of mutual information, the proposed scheme carries out the PSO’s
iterative update mechanisms to concurrently reﬁne the position of each particle until the largest mutual information is
attained. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is guaranteed to converge, outperforms existing schemes of
antenna selection or power allocation at the price of higher computational load and achieves near-optimal capacity of the
benchmark (full radio frequency (RF) chains) scheme at a signiﬁcant saving of RF chains.
1 Introduction
Driven by the demands of providing efﬁcient and reliable
quality of service for wireless communications, intensive
studies have been inspired to investigate various approaches
[1–6]. One of the promising approaches is cooperative
communications [5–8]. The main idea of cooperative
communications is that the source node uses the cooperative
relays’ antennas to construct a virtual antenna array to assist
the transmission reliability. As such, the number of the
source node’s antennas can be less than that of non-
cooperative communications. This implies that the hardware
size and cost for the source node can be reduced. Although
multi-hop transmission topologies can be implemented in
cooperative communications, two-hop mechanisms receive
more research attention [9, 10]. In two-hop cooperative
communications, sources transmit symbols to the destination
node as well as the cooperative relays in the ﬁrst time slot.
Next, the cooperative relays amplify and forward the
received signal to the destination node in the second time
slot. Therefore, with the assistance of relays, the transmission
reliability can be enhanced [5–7]. In addition, the
transmission coverage of communication systems is also
extended. Nevertheless, the price that cooperative
communication schemes have to pay is the reduction of
transmission rate. Therefore developing feasible cooperative
schemes to simultaneously enhance the reliability and
throughput of cooperative communications becomes an
urgency and important problem.
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which
deploy multiple antennas both at the transmitter and
receiver sides, have been shown to be a promising scheme
to provide spatial diversity and/or spatial multiplexing [11–
13]. With the beneﬁt of spatial diversity and/or spatial
multiplexing, MIMO systems hence can improve
transmission reliability and/or throughput [12]. Specially,
the contribution of spatial multiplexing gains can lead to
the system capacity growing linearly with the number of
transmit antennas [14]. To further extend MIMO usage,
existing schemes incorporating MIMO mechanisms have
been investigated, such as MIMO orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing [15, 16] and MIMO code division
multiple access [17, 18]. However, the main problem of
these approaches is their high cost of hardware incurred
[14]. For cost reduction, antenna selection (AS) is proposed
as a feasible means [19, 20]. Nevertheless, schemes with
AS inevitably suffer performance degradation caused by the
reduction of MIMO system dimensions [21]. Hence,
researches on how to concurrently reduce hardware cost and
possess beneﬁts from spatial diversity/multiplexing have
become an interesting and vital issue for MIMO wireless
systems.
Recently, MIMO cooperative systems, a hybrid of MIMO
and cooperative relays, have inspired a great deal of
researches because of the above-mentioned advantages and
problems. For example, a precoding scheme for the
cooperative relay to facilitate subsequent signal processing
has been proposed in [22], assuming that different levels of
channel state information are known at the cooperative
relay. The mutual information is maximised and preserved
when the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE)
detector is used at the destination node. As a result, ﬁnding

node and the relay for the transmission. The channels are all
assumed to be mutually independent and ﬂat Rayleigh fading.
In addition, the channels’ coefﬁcients remain unchanged in a
transmitted frame and vary independently frame by frame.
We denote the N × Q channels between the source and the
destination nodes, the source node and the relay, and the
relay and the destination node, respectively, as H0, H1 and
H2. Furthermore, we construct a power allocation matrix W
at the relay’s transmitter to make proper use of the
transmission power to enhance performance.
The transmission is divided into two phases. In the ﬁrst
phase, the source transmits the message vector b and the
signals received at the destination node and the relay after
AC are y0 and y1, respectively
y0 = DH0b+ n0 (1)
and
y1 = RH1b+ n1 (2)
where n0 and n1 are Q × 1 mutually independent white noise
vectors received at the destination node and the relay,
respectively, with each entry Gaussian distributed with zero
mean and variance s2. In the second phase, the source node
remains silent and the relay scales the received signal y1 by
a weight matrix W(1/2) and forward the resultant signal
vector to the destination node. Thus, the received signal at
the destination node after AC is given by
y2 = DH2W (1/2)y1 + n2
= DH2W (1/2)RH1b+ DH2W (1/2)n1 + n2 (3)
where n2 is a Q × 1 white Gaussian noise vector with zero
mean and covariance matrix s2IQ. IQ is the Q × Q identity
matrix. By denoting y = [yT0 yT2 ]T and using (1) and (3), the
mutual information of this MIMO two-hop cooperative
system can be written as follows [23, 25]

where Ps denotes the transmission power of the source node;
and (.)T and (.)H represent the transpose and Hermitian
operations, respectively [32]. In (4), the scalar (1/2) at each
term results from the fact that the two-hop system considers
the signals received at two consecutive time slots.
Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst term is the capacity between the
source and the destination nodes, and the second one is
the capacity from the source node through the relay to the
destination node. Thus, concurrently using the feasible AC
matrices, D and R, and the power allocation matrix W to
maximise the mutual information may enhance the system
throughput while reducing the hardware complexity (cost).
3 Proposed scheme
The motivation of antenna combining/power allocation at
relay and destination nodes is that it can achieve maximum
throughput, while greatly reducing the hardware
complexity. The aim of the proposed scheme is to jointly
determine the best set of three matrices; the two receivers’
AC matrices of the relay and destination node, and the
relay’s power allocation matrix, for maximising the mutual
information (capacity) of the MIMO relay channel given the
number of activated RF chains at the relay and destination
terminals as well as the power constraints at the source and
relay terminals. The transmitted power at the source node is
limited to Ps and uniformly distributed at the Q transmitted
antennas. The relay allocates the relaying power Pr so that
the power allocation matrix satisﬁes the constraint
trace{W} ¼ Pr. Therefore using (4), the capacity
maximisation problem can be recast as
[D, R, W ] = arg max
D,R,W
I (y, b)
s.t. ||[RT]j|| = ||[DT]j|| = 1 and trace (W ) = Pr
(5)
where Pr is the transmission power of the relay, [X ]j denotes
the jth column vector of matrix X, ‖d‖ is the norm of vector d
and trace(.) represents the trace operation [33]. Note thatW is
a diagonal matrix, which allocates the power Pr to the relay’s
transmit antennas for performance enhancement. [RT]j and
[DT]j are normalised in order to maintain the received
powers at the relay’s (destination node’s) antennas without
additional power ampliﬁcation.
The task of jointly ﬁnding the optimal solutions of D, R
and W to solve (5) is rather challenging, because it is
highly non-linear and complicated. It would be extremely
difﬁcult to solve the problem if any conventional linear
approach is invoked. To design an optimal and low-
complexity algorithm in the sequel, we consider the PSO
algorithm [26, 27], one of the emerging evolutionary
methods, to tackle this joint optimisation problem.

of capacity against signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are,
respectively, shown in Figs. 3a and b. We can observe
that, either in Figs. 3a or b, the capacity increases and
reaches its limited value, when the number of generation G
increases up to 20. Furthermore, the capacity slightly
increases when the number of generations exceeds 15. As
the computational complexity of the proposed PSO scheme
depends on the product of the population size and the

First, we consider a MIMO cooperative system whereQ ¼ 3
transmit antennas and N ¼ 7 receive antennas are deployed at
the source/relay transmitter sides and at the relay/destination
receiver sides, respectively. In addition, only Q ¼ 3 RF
chains are active at the destination node (double at the relay)
for the GA-AS, power allocation and the proposed PSO
schemes. Note that, in the power allocation method, the
precoder is a square matrix with its dimensions solely
determined by the number of RF chains, thus N ¼ Q ¼ 3 is

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2, we describe the signal model adopted in this paper.
We discuss the proposed scheme and the performance analysis
in Section 3 and Section 4 respectively. In Section 5, we
detail the simulation results to demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed scheme. Section 6 contains some concluding
remarks.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider the uplink of a synchronous MC DS-CDMA
system with M antennas deployed at the receiver of the
base station. For simplicity, we assume that the channel
information and all signature codes used are perfectly known
at the receiver. In addition, there are K users concurrently
transmitting BPSK modulated symbols through the frequency
selective slow Rayleigh fading channels to the base station.
Note that before the transmission, the BPSK symbols are
first spread by their own unique T-domain signature codes.
Then, they are copied to each subcarrier, and multiplied by
the corresponding element of each user’s unique F-domain
signature code [1] [4] . Let tk = [tk,1 tk,2 · · · tk,Nt ]
′
and
fk = [fk,1 fk,2 · · · fk,Nf ]
′ be, respectively, the T-domain and
the F-domain signature code of the kth user, where Nt and
Nf are the lengths of the associated signature codes and (·)′
denotes the transpose operation. Then, the baseband discrete
received signal at the lth chip time of a prescribed time slot,
at the ith subcarrier, and at the mth antenna, rmil, 1 ≤ m ≤
M, 1 ≤ i ≤ Nf , 1 ≤ l ≤ Nt, can be expressed as follows
[4]:
rmil =
K∑
k=1
ak,mhk,mifk,itk,l
√
pkbk + nmil (1)
where ak,m, hk,mi, pk, and bk denote, respectively, the antenna
response, the fading channel coefficient of the ith subcarrier
at the mth antenna, the transmitted power, and the respective
BPSK symbol for user k; nmil is the corresponding additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance
σ2. To fit the detector structures of the proposed MUD, we
first combine the M received signals rmil,m = 1 · · ·M in (1)
to form an M × 1 S-domain received signal vector, rSil, given
by
rSil = [r1il r2il · · · rMil]

√
pkbk + nSil,
where the superscript S of rSil in (2) denotes the signal received
in the S-domain because the elements of rSil are collected from
all the receive antennas. For brevity, we define the S-domain
signature vector ak = [ak,1 ak,2 ak,M ]′ for user k and the
corresponding effective S-domain signature vector as a˜k,i =
ak¯hk,i; hk,i = [hk,1i hk,2i · · · hk,Mi]′ is the channel vector
of the ith subcarrier for user k and ¯ is the Hardmard product
operator [1]; nSil = [n1il n2il · · · nMil]
′ is the associated
M×1 AWGN vector. Next, we combine all the NfNt vectors,
rSil, i = 1 · · ·Nf and l = 1 · · ·Nt to obtain the complete
received signal, RS−FT , expressed as
RS−FT = [rS11 r

as the M×Nf effective
S-domain signature matrix and the NfNt × Nf FT-domain
signature matrix, respectively, for user k; 01×Nt is the 1×Nt
zero vector. In addition, let NS−FT = [nS11 nS12 · · · nSNfNt ]
be the associated M × NfNt AWGN matrix. Similar to rSil
in (2), the superscript (S − FT ) in RS−FT denotes that the
signals received from all antennas are stacked to form the S-
domain received vectors, which are then combined column by
column in the FT-domain.
III. THE PROPOSED SCHEME
In this section, we describe the proposed low-complexity
MMSE MUD, which estimates the transmitted symbols it-
eratively by utilizing the corresponding S-domain and the
FT-domain MMSE detectors alternately. We also use the
optimum joint SFT-domain MMSE MUD, which requires a
prohibitive number of computations to invert a large matrix,
as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the proposed
scheme.
A. Optimum Joint SFT-domain MMSE MUD
First, we invoke the optimum joint SFT-domain MMSE
MUD, wSFTj , for user j by minimizing the following cost
function
wSFTj = arg min
wSFT
E
[∣∣∣bj −wSFTHrSFT ∣∣∣2], 1 ≤ j ≤ K
(4)
where (·)H indicates the Hermititian operation; rSFT =
[r111, r112, · · · , r11Nt , r121, r122, · · · , rMNfNt ]
′ is the
MNfNt×1 SFT-domain complete received signal, expressed
as rSFT =
∑K
k=1 c
SFT
k
√
pkbk + nSFT , where rmil, m =
1 · · ·M, i = 1 · · ·Nf , and l = 1 · · ·Nt, is a received signal
defined in (1); cSFTk is the MNfNt×1 SFT-domain effective
signature vector for user k; nSFT denotes the associated
AWGN vector. Then, after some manipulations, the solution
to (4) is derived as follows:
wSFTj = (
K∑
k=1
cSFTk c
SFTH
k pk + σ
2IMNfNt)
−1cSFTj
√
pj (5)
From (5), it is clear that finding the joint SFT-domain MMSE
MUD, wSFTj incurs a large computational overhead because
of the number of operations required to compute the inversion
of a large MNfNt×MNfNt matrix. To address this problem,
we propose a low-complexity scheme, S-FT-domain MMSE
MUD, which we discuss in the following sub-section.

are frequency selective slow Rayleigh fading channels and
the inter-symbol interference (ISI) effect is small and can
be ignored. In addition, the channel information and all the
signature codes utilized are available at the base station. The
base station is deployed with M = 8 receive antennas and
all users simultaneously transmit BPSK modulated symbols
to the base station. In our rich simulations, we observe that
the proposed MUD converge at about 3 iterations and hence
let the number of iterations of the MUD be 3.
First, we assess the BER performance of the proposed
scheme at system parameters, M = 8, Nf = 9, Nt = 12.
The BER of the optimum joint SFT-domain MMSE MUD
is also provided as the performance bound for the proposed
scheme. Also, two different numbers of users, K = 10 and
K = 100, are considered and the simulation results are shown
in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1, we observe that the performances of the
proposed scheme and the optimum joint SFT-domain MMSE
MUD all degrade when the number of users changes K = 10
to K = 100. However, in the two scenarios, the proposed
scheme’s performance are both close to those of the optimum
joint SFT-domain MMSE MUD. This finding demonstrates
that, like the optimum joint SFT MMSE MUD, the proposed
S-FT-domain MMSE MUD can provide enough signal space
to alleviate the MAI effect.
Next, the system parameters and the numbers of users
considered in Fig. 2 are the same as those in Fig. 1, except
that Nf = 12, Nt = 9. From the figure, we observe that the
conclusions drawn from Fig. 1 is still validated by the results
in Fig. 2. That is the performances of the proposed scheme
are close to those of the optimum joint SFT-domain MMSE
MUD.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present a low-complexity, yet effective,
MUD for SFT-domain spread MC DS-CDMA systems. First,
to develop the proposed MUD, an adapted format of the
complete received signal is employed. Then, the MUD es-

timates the transmitted symbols iteratively by using the S-
domain detector and the FT-domain detector alternately. We
analyzed the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of
the MSE bound and the computational complexity. The results
of simulations show that the performance of the proposed
MUD is close to that of the optimum joint SFT-domain MMSE
MUD, but with lower computational overheads.

Also, each of the users utilizes his/her own 𝑀×1 beamformer
to multiply the transmitted symbols. The beamforming signal
are then transmitted from the corresponding 𝑀 transmit an-
tennas over the Reyleigh fading channel to the base station. As
a result, the base station’s received signal r can be collected
from the 𝑁 receive antennas and expressed as
r =
𝐾∑
𝑘=1
H𝑘t𝑘𝑏𝑘 + n = ℋb+ n, (1)
where r = [𝑟1 𝑟2 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝑟𝑁 ]𝑇 , in which (⋅)𝑇 and 𝑟𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅𝑁
represent the transpose operation [13] and the 𝑗th receive
antenna’s received signal, respectively; H𝑘 is the 𝑁 × 𝑀
channel matrix between user 𝑘 and the receiver; 𝑏𝑘 and t𝑘 are
the 𝑘th user’s transmitted symbol and the 𝑀 ×1 beamformer,
respectively. We assume the elements of H𝑘 are complex
Gaussian random variables with distribution 𝒞𝒩 (0, 1). n is
the 𝑁 × 1 additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector and
its elements are distributed with 𝒞𝒩 (0, 𝜎2). For brevity, we
denote ℋ=[H1t1 H2t2 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ H𝐾t𝐾 ] and b = [𝑏1 𝑏2 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝑏𝐾 ]𝑇 ,
which are referred to as the totally effective channel matrix and
the transmitted symbol vector, respectively.
Further, we assume the transmitted symbols in (1) are
statistically independent, i.e E{bb𝐻}=I𝐾 , where I𝐾 , (⋅)𝐻 ,
and E{⋅} denotes the 𝐾 ×𝐾 identity matrix, the Hermitian
operation and the expectation operator, respectively [13]. We
also assume that the channel state information (CSI) of all
users can be perfectly obtained from the low-rate feedback
channel. Then, the capacity of the multiuser MIMO channel
can be readily expressed as
𝐶 = log2 𝑑𝑒𝑡(I𝐾 +
𝐸𝑏
𝑀𝜎2
ℋ𝐻ℋ), (2)
where 𝑑𝑒𝑡(A) is the determinant of matrix A [13]; 𝐸𝑏 =
𝐸(∣𝑏𝑘∣2) is a transmitted symbol energy. Let 𝑃𝑘 be the
maximum transmission power for the 𝑘th user and the cor-
responding transmit beamformer is constrained by
∥t𝑘∥2 = t𝑘𝐻t𝑘 ≤ ?¯?

B. QUASI-SINR-MAX COOPERATIVE TRANSMIT BEAM-
FORMING, q-CTBF
In [3], Xi et al. assumed that the full channel state in-
formation between all users and the base station is perfectly
known at the transmitters, which can be obtained by a low-
rate feedback channel. In addition, they also assumed the
transmitted symbols are mutually i.i.d. and then proposed a
quasi-SINR-max CTBF (q-CTBF) scheme to find the transmit
beamformers in (1). The results of the q-CTBFs are shown as
[3],

where t𝑞−𝐶𝑇𝐵𝐹𝑘 , 𝑘 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅𝐾, is the quasi-SINR-max based
CTBFs for the 𝑘th user; and −−−−−−→𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑒.𝑣.(A) represents the
eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of ma-
trix A. Obviously, due to the i.i.d assumption for simplifying
the CTBF problem, as a result, the q-CTBF scheme can only
achieve sub-optimal solutions.
III. PROPOSED SCHEME
To further enhance the CTBFs’ performance, in this sec-
tion we proposed an embedded particle swarm optimiza-
tion/parallel iterative update (PSO/PIU) scheme to concur-
rently search users’ cooperative transmit beamformers. In the
following subsections, we first reviewed the conventional PSO
and the PIU; and then presented the proposed scheme.
A. REVIEW OF THE CONVENTIONAL PSO
The PSO, proposed by Eberhart and Kennedy [9], is a
stochastic, population-based optimization approach, which is
originally used to simulate the social behavior of the birds. In
the PSO, the swarm is constituted by 𝑄 particles (birds). A
particle generally represents a possible solution candidate and
the number of particles, 𝑄, is referred to as the population size
of the PSO. To guide the particles toward the optimum solu-
tion, the PSO iteratively updates the positions and velocities
of the 𝑄 particles by
x𝑖+1𝑘 = x
𝑖
𝑘 + v
𝑖
𝑘Δ𝑡, 𝑘 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅𝑄 (5)
and
v𝑖+1𝑘 = 𝛽v
𝑖
𝑘 + 𝑙0c0 ⊙ (p𝑖𝑘 − x𝑖𝑘)
+ 𝑙1c1⊙(g − x𝑖𝑘), 𝑘 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅𝑄 (6)
respectively, where we denote the 𝑘th particle’s position
at the 𝑖th iteration as x𝑖𝑘 = [𝑥𝑖𝑘,1 𝑥𝑖𝑘,2 ... 𝑥𝑖𝑘,𝑑]𝑇 , 𝑘 =
1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅𝑄 and 𝑑 as the dimension of solution space; v𝑖𝑘 =
[𝑣𝑖𝑘,1 𝑣
𝑖
𝑘,2 ... 𝑣
𝑖
𝑘,𝑑]
𝑇 is the corresponding particle’s velocity
                                                                                                                                          2077
optimums. For instance, the jth personal position of user 𝑘 is
refined as
P¯𝑖𝑘(𝑗) =

𝑚 ∕=𝑘
H𝑚t
𝑖
𝑚(𝑗)t
𝑖𝐻
𝑚 (𝑗)H
𝐻
𝑚, 𝑘 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅𝐾, (12)
, which is similar to (7) and (8). Then, find the eigenvector
from P¯𝑖𝑘(𝑗) for the corresponding CTBF which is expressed
as,
t¯𝑖𝑚(𝑗) =
√
?¯?
𝐸𝑏
× −−−−−−→𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑒.𝑣.(H𝐻𝑘 [

𝑚=1,𝑚 ∕=𝑘
¯
𝑚
𝑀𝑁0
P¯𝑖𝑘(𝑗)
+ I]−1H𝑘), 𝑘 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅𝐾 (13)
Then, Let t𝑖+1𝑚 (𝑗) = t¯𝑖𝑚(𝑗) for the next PSO iteration.
Step 5: Repeat/End
The above Steps 3 and 4 are repeated iteratively and
terminated until the prescribed number 𝐺. Finally, the final
global optimum positions, g𝑘, 𝑘 = 1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅𝐾 are the estimated
CTBF.
IV. SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we discuss the simulation results for the
assessment of the proposed scheme. Assume the symbols
transmitted from the users are quadrature phase shift keying
(QPSK) modulated and the channels are flat Rayleigh fading.
For simplicity, all users concurrently transmit their QPSK
modulated symbols to the receiver of the base station. Also,
for fairness, the parameter settings of the conventional PSO
and of the proposed scheme are the same, which includes
the population size and the number of iterations. For easy
reference, they are shown in Table 1. In addition, we assume
the number of the active users 𝐾 is 5 and each of them is
with 𝑀 = 5 transmit antenna elements. The simulations of
the successive IU (SIU) [4], the PIU [4], the conventional PSO
[9] are also conducted for comparison. Also, the single user
bound is provided as the performance benchmark. The results
of the BER performance versus the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
for the above-mentioned schemes are shown in Figs. 3-6.
First, we consider the number of receive antenna elements,
𝑁 , deployed in the receiver of the base station, is 5. Hence,
the system setting is (𝐾 = 5,𝑀 = 5, 𝑁 = 5), which is a full
loading scenario due to 𝐾 = 𝑁 . From Fig. 3, we can observe
that the proposed embedded PSO/PIU scheme converges at
about the 26th iteration. According to this result, we set the
number of iterations, 𝐺, for the proposed scheme and the
conventional PSO both be 26 and show the corresponding
BER versus SNR performance of the aforementioned schemes
in Fig. 4. We can observe from the result of Fig. 4 that the
proposed scheme outperforms the other three schemes. For
example, at given BER = 10−5, the proposed scheme can
provide about 3.5 dB SNR performance improvement gain
compared to the conventional PSO. Therefore, embedding
the PIU mechanism into the conventional PSO is suitable
and effective for the CTBFs’ performance improvement. Fur-
thermore, Fig. 4 also shows the results of the PIU scheme
[4] exist performance floor at about SNR ≥ 12 dB The
performance floor may be incurred by error propagation. The
error propagation problem also exits at the SIU scheme, which
leads to the performance of the SIU degrades significantly.
Next, we assess the overloading performance of the pro-
posed scheme, which means the number of the active users
is larger than the number of the transmitter’s antenna el-
ements. We consider the scenarios with the system setting
(𝐾 = 5,𝑀 = 4, 𝑁 = 5) and show the proposed scheme’s
convergence result and the BER comparison in Figs. 5 and
6, respectively. Note that since the result of Fig. 5 converges
at about the 22th iteration, the number of iterations for the
proposed scheme and the conventional PSO is hence set to
22. Furthermore, we also observe from the result of Fig. 4
that the four schemes’ performance all degrades in such an
overloading scenario but the proposed scheme still performs
the best.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we consider a cooperative multiuser multi-
ple input multiple output transmit beamforming system. We
adopt the particle swarm optimization to jointly search the
users’ cooperative transmit beamformers. Also, to enhance
the system performance, we proposed a new PSO scheme by
embedding the parallel iterative update (PIU) mechanism into
the conventional PSO to refine the estimated CTBFs. Finally,
simulation results show the new proposed scheme can provide
significant performance gain compared to existing works, even
in overloading scenarios.

Abstract— In this paper, we present a two-stage multiuser
detection (MUD) scheme for near-real-time relay CDMA systems.
Relay communications have received intensive research attention
recently because of their benefit of spatial diversity. However,
existing works generally have serious latency problems, which
will reduce transmission rates. To solve the problems, we consider
a near-real-time transmission strategy for relay CDMA systems.
Also, a two-stage MUD scheme is proposed for the detectors at
the relays and the destination node to ensure the feasibility of the
transmission strategy. The proposed MUD scheme first conducts
the zero forcing (ZF) method to suppress the multiple access
interfere and then uses the maximum likelihood (ML) mechanism
to estimate the transmitted symbols. Specially, the two-stage
MUD scheme only requires few computations to conduct the ML
mechanism. Simulation results and complexity analysis show that
the proposed scheme can not only provide significant diversity
gain with a modest computational complexity but also assist relay
CDMAs to facilitate the near-real-time transmission.
I. INTRODUCTION
Relay communications have inspired considerable research
attention recently because of their benefit of spatial diversity
[1], [2]. Actually, The objective for developing multiple an-
tenna approaches is to receive antenna array gains and spatial
diversity [3], [4] to enhance system performance. One of
these important approaches is multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) [5]. In particular, studies have shown that MIMOs are
capable of providing significant spatial diversity but without
increasing the consumption of frequency resource [6]. How-
ever, deploying multiple antennas in future wireless systems,
especially in handset equipments, will become difficult for
practical implementation [1]. This is because the trend of wire-
less equipments will be lighter and smaller than before. Hence,
future wireless equipments will inevitably meet the issue of
space limitation. To address the issue, relay communications,
in which source nodes transmit their message to relays and
then relays regenerate the transmitted signal to a destination
node, have been proved that they are capable of providing
virtual spatial diversity for performance enhancement [7].
However, in existing works, the time for facilitating a symbol
transmission generally requires two or more symbol periods.
As a result, serious latency problems appear in existing works.
Furthermore, code division multiple access (CDMA) has
been one of the multiple access candidates for current and
future wireless communication systems due to its high spec-
tral efficiency and robustness to multipath fading effect [8].
However, in CDMA-like systems, due to the non-orthogonality
among users’ spreading codes [9], the transmission will ex-
perience the disturbance of the multiple access interference
(MAI). As a result, the MAI effect seriously degrades the
system performance. To improve the performance, a great
deal of studies have shown multiuser detection (MUD) [9] is
one of the most effective approaches to facilitate interference
mitigation. The conventional approaches include the optimal
MUD, say maximum likelihood (ML), and the suboptimal
MUDs, such as zero forcing (ZF), minimum mean square
error (MMSE), successive interference cancellation (SIC),
and parallel interference cancellation (PIC) [9]. Furthermore,
thanks to the feasibility of the MUDs to alleviate the MAI,
considerable researchers have applied the above MUDs to
relay CDMA systems recently [10]-[13]. For example, Cao
et al. [10] proposed the MMSE MUD for the detectors at
relays and at a destination node to estimate the transmitted
symbols. In [11], based on the knowledge assumption of
perfect or partial channel information at the relays and the
destination node, several variants of the MMSE MUDs have
also been proposed for relay CDMA systems. In addition,
a simple but effective method has also presented in [11]
for partner relay selection . To receive full advantages of
relays, Huang et al. proposed a relaying assisted ZF MUD
by using precoders at relays and pre-whiting filters at the
destination node [12]. In [13], MMSE MUDs with different
partner selection strategies have been studied to improve the
system performance. However, the above-mentioned existing
works all have the transmission latency problems.
To solve the latency problems of the existing works, we con-
sider a near-real-time relay CDMA system and propose a two-
stage MUD scheme to ensure the feasibility of the systems.
In contrast to existing works, the key of the considered relay
CDMA system is to allow relays concurrently to receive the
transmitted signal and to transmit the regenerated signal. As
a result, each of the relays will receive the transmitted signal
from the source nodes as well as the regenerated signal from
the other relays at the same time. Hence, the MAI effect at
the relays will become more serious than those of the above-
mentioned works. To alleviate the annoying MAI effect to
ensure the feasibility of the near-real-time transmission, in
this paper we propose a new two-stage MUD scheme for the
detectors at the relays and the destination node. The proposed
                                                                                                                                          1438
where R = S𝑇S is the 𝐾 × 𝐾 spreading code correlation
matrix; and u𝑙(𝑚) = S𝑇n𝑙(𝑚) is the corresponding AWGN
vector output with 𝒩 (0, 𝜎2𝑛R). Furthermore, the key objective
of the 𝑙th relay is to estimate the transmitted symbol vector
b(𝑚) from y𝑙(𝑚) in (4). Therefore, at relay 𝑙, the proposed
two-stage MUD scheme first conducts the ZF method to
suppress the MAI effect and the output of the ZF mechanism
is expressed as
z𝑙(𝑚) = R
−1y𝑙(𝑚)
= H𝑙b(𝑚) +
𝐿∑
𝑗=1,𝑗 ∕=𝑙
ℎ˜𝑙,𝑗W𝑗b˜
𝑗(𝑚− 1) + v𝑙(𝑚), (5)
where v𝑙(𝑚) = [𝑣𝑙,1(𝑚), ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑣𝑙,𝐾(𝑚)]𝑇 is the correspond-
ing noise output vector. Furthermore, due to H𝑙 and W𝑗 both
being 𝐾 ×𝐾 diagonal matrices, (5) can be re-expressed as
z𝑙(𝑚) = [𝑧𝑙,1(𝑚) 𝑧𝑙,2(𝑚) ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ 𝑧𝑙,𝐾(𝑚)]𝑇 , 1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝐿 (6)
=
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

∑
𝑗 ∕=𝑙 ℎ˜𝑙,𝑗𝑤𝑗,𝐾 ?˜?
𝑗
𝐾(𝑚− 1) + 𝑣𝑙,𝐾(𝑚)
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ ,
Note that, at the 𝑚th symbol period, the 𝑙th relay has already
obtained the estimates, ?˜?𝑙1(𝑚− 1), ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , ?˜?𝑙𝐾(𝑚− 1) for the 𝐾
transmitted symbols 𝑏1(𝑚− 1), ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑏𝐾(𝑚− 1). We assume
the estimates are all correct and substitute them into (6) to
replace ?˜?𝑗1(𝑚 − 1), ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , ?˜?𝑗𝐾(𝑚 − 1), 𝑗 ∕= 𝑙. As a result, each
element in (6) only contains a unknown symbol, e. g. 𝑏1(𝑚)
in 𝑧𝑙,1(𝑚).
Next, the proposed scheme uses (6) and conducts the ML
method to estimate 𝑏𝑘(𝑚), which is formulated as,
?˜?𝑙𝑘(𝑚) =
𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑏𝑘(𝑚) = {1,−1} ∣∣𝑧𝑙,𝑘(𝑚)− 𝛽𝑙,𝑘∣∣ (7)
where 𝑘 = 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ,𝐾 and 𝑙 = 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝐿; ∣∣ ⋅ ∣∣ denotes
the Euclidean norm [14]; and we let 𝛽𝑙,𝑘 = ℎ𝑙,𝑘𝑏𝑘(𝑚) +∑
𝑗 ∕=𝑙 ℎ˜𝑙,𝑗𝑤𝑗,𝑘 ?˜?
𝑙
𝑘(𝑚 − 1) for notation brevity. As a result,
the 𝑙th relay uses (7) and attains the estimates for the 𝐾
transmitted symbols 𝑏1(𝑚), ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑏𝐾(𝑚). Also, it is clear that
only a unknown symbol needs to be estimated in (7). This
implies that the relays use a small amount of computations to
conduct the ML method.
B. The symbol detection at the destination node:
Similar to the above relays, the proposed scheme passes the
received signal of the destination node, d(𝑚) in (3) through
the matched filter bank S and the ZF mechanism R−1. As a
result, we have the output of the ZF mechanism is expressed
as,
x(𝑚) =
𝐿∑
𝑗=1,𝑗 ∕=𝑙
ℎ˜𝑑,𝑗W𝑗b˜
𝑗(𝑚− 1) + p(𝑚),
=
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

𝑗

𝑗 ∕=𝑙 ℎ˜𝑑,𝑗𝑤𝑗,2?˜?
𝑗
2(𝑚− 1) + 𝑝2(𝑚)
.
.
.∑
𝑗 ∕=𝑙 ℎ˜𝑑,𝑗𝑤𝑗,𝐾 ?˜?
𝑗
𝐾(𝑚− 1) + 𝑝𝐾(𝑚)
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ , (8)
where p(𝑚) = [𝑝1(𝑚), ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑝𝐾(𝑚)]𝑇 is the corresponding
noise vector at the ZF mechanism’s output.
Furthermore, we assume the estimates at the relays are all
correct. This implies the estimates of the relays are all the
same. So, we let ?˜?𝑘(𝑚 − 1) = ?˜?1𝑘(𝑚 − 1) =, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ,= ?˜?𝐿𝑘 (𝑚 −
1), 𝑘 = 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ,𝐾 in (8). Then, we use (8) and conduct the
ML method to estimate the 𝑘th transmitted symbol, which is
formulated as,
?ˆ?𝑘(𝑚− 1) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑏𝑘(𝑚− 1) = {1,−1} ∣∣𝑥𝑘(𝑚)− 𝛾𝑘∣∣, (9)
where 𝑘 = 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ,𝐾 and 𝛾𝑘 =
∑
𝑗 ∕=𝑙 ℎ˜𝑑,𝑗𝑤𝑗,𝑘 ?˜?𝑘(𝑚− 1). The
same reason as (7), we also only needs to estimate the symbol
?˜?𝑘(𝑚 − 1) in (9). Therefore, the amount of computations
required by the ML method at the destination node is still
small. At last, let ?ˆ?𝑘(𝑚 − 1) be the final estimate for the
transmitted symbol 𝑏𝑘(𝑚− 1).
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To assess the performance of the proposed scheme, we
carried out computer simulations and complexity analysis in
this section. For simplicity, we assume the 𝐾 source nodes
concurrently transmit BPSK modulated symbols over Rayleigh
flat fading channels to the destination node and the 𝐿 relays.
In addition, the destination node and the relays all have perfect
knowledge of the source nodes’ spreading codes. The length
of the spreading codes is 𝑁 . For ease of description, the
channel coefficients, ℎ𝑙,𝑘, ℎ˜𝑑,𝑗 , and ℎ˜𝑙,𝑗 , are all assumed to
be complex Gaussian random variables, respectively, with
𝒩 (0, 𝜎2), 𝒩 (0, ?˜?2), and 𝒩 (0, 𝜎2). In addition, the channel
coefficients between the source nodes and the destination node
are complex Gaussian random variables with 𝒩 (0, ?˜?2). For
performance comparison, we also carry out the ZF and the ML
methods in the following simulations. The results of average
bit error rate (BER) versus total transmit power are shown in
Figs. 2-5.
First, we consider the system settings, 𝐾 = 4, 𝑁 =
16, 𝜎2 = 1, ?˜?2 = 116 and the corresponding simulation results
of the above-mentioned three methods are shown in Fig. 2.
From Fig. 2, we observe that the proposed scheme with two
relays (i.e. 𝐿 = 2) outperforms the ZF and the ML methods.
For example, the proposed scheme with two relays yields
above about 4 dB transmit power gains compared to the other
two methods, when the average BER value is 0.01. In addition,
as changing the amount of relays from 2 to 6, the proposed
scheme can further attain extra about 1 dB transmit power
gain. Intuitively, this is because six relays are capable of
providing more spatial diversity than two relays.
To further test the loading problem for the proposed scheme,
we increase the number of users from 𝐾 = 4 to 7 and 10
respectively. The other settings are all the same as those in
                                                                                                                                          1440

the near-real-time transmission strategy, a two-stage multiuser
detection scheme is proposed for the detectors at the relays
and the destination node. The proposed scheme first conducts
the zero forcing mechanism to suppress the multiple access
interference and then carries out the maximum likelihood
mechanism to estimate the transmitted symbols. Simulation
results and complexity analysis show that at such a near-real-

provide significant diversity gain with a modest computational
complexity but also assist relay CDMAs to facilitate the near-
