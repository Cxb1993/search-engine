anisotropic media, the DRM does not exist. 
However, only the body forces of gravity are 
considered for most of the practical 
elastostatics problems. Moreover, analytical 
solutions of the body forces of gravity for 
three-dimensional anisotropic media can be 
lucky found in literatures.  
The purpose of this project is to derive 
analytically the MFS formulation for 
three-dimensional anisotropic media and to 
compose the analytical solutions of the body 
forces of gravity. Therefore, an innovative 
meshless numerical method will be developed 
for three-dimensional anisotropic 
homogeneous linear elastostatics problems 
with body forces of gravity. Computational 
implementations will be carried out and 
numerical results will be discussed and 
compared with the analytical solutions as well 
as the results in literatures. Moreover, the 
results of the present project will be published 
in international journals.

二、研究目的與文獻探討 
  In the numerical solutions for partial 
differential equations, it is well known that the 
finite difference method (FDM), the finite 
element method (FEM), and the boundary 
element method (BEM) are well-established 
numerical techniques for computational 
mechanics. However, the FDM usually requires 
an orthogonal mesh system, which makes it 
very difficult to model an irregular domain. On 
the other hand, the generation of mesh is 
inevitable when the FEM and the BEM are 
adopted to handle scientific and engineering 
problems. In order to seek a more general 
method that can overcome the difficulties of 
mesh generation, meshless or mesh-free 
techniques have become quite popular in many 
interdisciplinary fields. In general, the meshless 
methods can be loosely divided into two 
categories, the boundary-type and the 
domain-type. One commonly used scheme in 
the domain-type category is the so-called 
Kansa’s method [1,2] from radial basis 
functions (RBFs) family and another one 
popularly utilized method in the boundary-type 
category is the method of fundamental 
solutions (MFS), which will be discussed later. 
In the MFS, the approximate numerical 
solution for a given problem is obtained by a 
linear combination of the fundamental 
solutions with respect to source points that are 
located on an artificial boundary. The MFS 
retains the advantages of the BEM in which the 
solution procedure does not require the 
discretization of the interior domain, but at the 
same time the method overcomes the problem 
of singularity and also avoids the element 
integrations. Since the MFS does not require 
mesh discretization of the interior region of the 
computational domain, a significant amount of 
computational effort and time is saved 
compared to the domain discretization methods. 
Due to its simplicity in implementation the 
MFS has been applied successfully to deal with 
different types of boundary value problems as 
discussed in References [3-6]. The MFS is first 
proposed by Kupradze and Aleksidze in 1964 
[7]. Later, the MFS for biharmonic equations in 
the interior domains had been investigated by 
Karageorghis and Fairweather [8]. Also, 
Golberg [9] and Golberg & Chen [5] used the 
method of fundamental solutions to obtain 
numerical solution of the Poisson equation. 
Fairweather & Karageorghis [3] and Poullikkas 
et al. [10,11] solved the harmonic and 
biharmonic boundary value problems by the 
method of fundamental solutions. Chen et al. 
[12] and Barakrishnan & Ramachandran [13] 
applied the method of fundamental solutions 
for diffusion equations by using the modified 
Helmholtz fundamental solution. On the other 
hand, Tsai [6] and Young et al. [14,15] 
innovated the MFS based on the direct usage of 
diffusion fundamental solutions for diffusion 
equations. With the advent of the MFS 
techniques, numerical solutions of partial 
differential equations have become much easier 
and efficient compared to the other mesh 
dominated numerical methods. Furthermore, 
the mathematical characteristics of the MFS 
keep the options open for developing new 
solution scheme. 
 The main purpose of the present project is 
to extend the MFS for linear elastostatics
