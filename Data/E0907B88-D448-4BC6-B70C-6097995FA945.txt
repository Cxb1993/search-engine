3rewritable memory. In addition, fixing techniques for non-destructive reading and long-term
conserving for stored data in LiNbO3 crystals have been presented [11-13].
However, the diffraction efficiency of volume holograms in LiNbO3 crystals strongly depends on
the effective electro-optic coefficient, which is corresponding to the recording geometry. When
multiplexing technique is implemented for storage in a LiNbO3 disk, the disk will be rotated and
the crystallographic axis of the LiNbO3 crystal also rotates. Because the orientation of
crystallographic axis in LiNbO3 disk will affect the effective electro-optic coefficient, it can be
predicted that effective electro-optic coefficients of the holograms will vary with the rotation
angle and different effective electro-optic coefficients will lead to unequal diffraction efficiency.
Though several holographic disk systems using a LiNbO3 disk have been presented to
demonstrate high storage capacity for volume holographic storage [6, 8], the effect of unequal
effective electro-optic coefficients on diffraction efficiency induced by the rotation of the
LiNbO3 disk has never been discussed. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is trying to find a
suitable recording geometry for volume holographic storage in a LiNbO3 disk which can offer
equal effective electro-optic coefficients when the disk is rotated. In this paper, the effective
electro-optic coefficients for several possible recording geometries in a LiNbO3 disk are analyzed.
We find 2k-reflection holograms in a c-cut LiNbO3 disk keep a uniform quantity of effective
electro-optic coefficients when the disk is rotated. According to the analyses and from the point
of view of equal diffraction efficiency, a reflection hologram in a c-cut LiNbO3 crystal is a
suitable recording geometry for multiplexing storage in a rotation LiNbO3 disk.
2. Theoretical analysis on effective electro-optic coefficient
According to Kogelnik’s formula [14], the diffraction efficiency of phase volume hologram
strongly depends on the refractive-index change inside the recording materials. Refractive-index
change can be obtained by [15]
Ernn eff

1 (1)
where n is refractive-index of background, E is space charge field, and effr is the effective
electro-optic coefficient, which can be described as [15]
iijkdeff PKrPr  (2)
iP and dP are the unit vectors of polarizations of the incident and diffraction lights,
respectively. K is the unit grating-vector, and ijkr is the electro-optic tensor. If effective-optic
coefficient for various recording geometries is obtained, diffraction efficiency of volume
holographic grating can be calculated according to Kogelnik’s formula.
Usually, a LiNbO3 crystal can be cut along its crystallographic directions, i.e., its faces are
normal to a, b, or c axis. The three possible recording conditions for a LiNbO3 disk are shown in
Fig. 1. For example, when the face of LiNbO3 disk is normal to c-axis, the disk will rotate around
c-axis if multiplexing storage is implemented. In each case, the both writing beams for
constructing the holograms can be TE waves or TM waves. First, we considered the condition
that disk rotates around c-axis in counter-clock direction.

At first, we assume the incident plane lies on a-c plane. The recording structure in free and
k-space is shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). If the signal beam and the reading beam both are TE modes

2.2 Disk rotating around a-axis (or b-axis)
When disk is rotated around a-axis or b-axis, the recording structure in free and k-space are
shown in Fig. 4. Both two writing beams are TE modes or TM modes in free space. When
multiplexing storage is performed, the disk will be rotated. The incident plane of holograms will
not always lie on a-c plane (or b-c plane). When disk is rotated with an angle θ, the incident
plane in k-space is shown in Fig.4(b). TE or TM waves in free space can be decomposed into
two eigenwaves inside the crystal. The coupling between various eigenwaves is possible owing
to photovoltaic effect [15-17] and thus four gratings will be generated [18] as shown in Fig.4(b).
The amplitude of each eigenwave varies with the rotating angle and that will affect the strength
of these four gratings. Though we can calculate the effective electro-optic coefficient for each
grating, the strength of each one varies with the rotating angle and leads to complexity in
controlling the diffraction efficiency. Therefore, using this recording condition for holographic
storage is not suggested. Consequently, a c-cut LiNbO3 disk is a better choice for multiplexing
storage in a rotation holographic disk.
3. Simulation and discussions
Fig. 5 (a) and (b) show the transmission and reflection geometry of volume holograms in a c-cut
LiNbO3 disk, respectively. In our system design, a LiNbO3 disk with no=2.323 and ne=2.234 for
wavelength of 532nm is used as a recording material. The signal beam is kept to be normal
incident on the surface of disk. The incident angle of reference beam  can vary from 0 to 
in the air. The hologram is a transmission type when 20  , and when  2 , the
hologram is a reflection type. The refraction angle inside the crystal can be obtained from Snell’s
law once incident angle in the air is decided.
When writing beams are both TE waves, transmission and reflection gratings in k-space are
shown in Fig.6. The full angle between two wave vectorsas shown in Fig. 6(a) can be obtained
from Snell’s law
 on sinsin 1 (11)
And the grating angle can be described in term of .
2 (12)
Substituting Eq. (11) and Eq. (12) into Eq. (6), we can find the effective electro-optic coefficient
is a function of  (rotation angle of disk) and  (incident angle of reference beam). The
rotation angle of disk varies from 0° to 360°, and incident angle of reference beam only varies
from 0° to 90° for transmission holograms. The simulation results of effective electro-optic
coefficient are shown in Fig. 8(a). We assumed the parameters required for the simulation are
V
pmr 6.813  , V
pmr 6.8122  , V
pmr 8.3033  , and V
pmr 2851  [19].
For reflection grating as shown in Fig. 6(b), the full angle between two wave vectorsis
 on sinsin 1 (13)
and grating angle can be described as
2 (14)
Substituting Eq. (13) and Eq. (14) into Eq. (6), the simulation results of effective electro-optic
coefficient for reflection holograms when two writing beams are both TE waves are shown in
7only occurs when holographic gating is a 2k-reflection grating. Accordingly, we conclude that
reflection holograms constructed by two counter-propagation waves in a c-cut LiNbO3 crystal
are the most suitable recording geometry for holographic storage in a rotation LiNbO3 disk
because they have equal diffraction efficiency.
However, Bragg diffraction selectivity for holographic multiplexing storage also depends on
recording geometry. In a holographic disk memory, shift multiplexing or angle multiplexing is
usually required to store multiple images. Unfortunately, a 2k-reflection hologram in a LiNbO3
disk will lead poor shift selectivity or angle selectivity. It seems that there is a trade-off between
shift (or angle) selectivity and uniform of effective electro-optic coefficients. A good solution is
using random phase shift multiplexing techniques [3, 8-10] for these multiplexed reflection
holograms. Matoba et al. have presented a reflection-type holographic disk memory with random
phase shift multiplexing [8]. In their system, reflection holographic disk memory performs high
shift selectivity as in transmission holographic memory. Using this multiplexing technique for
reflection holograms, high diffraction selectivity and uniform of effective electro-optic
coefficients can be obtained simultaneously in a LiNbO3 disk.
4. Conclusions
According to our analyses of effective electro-optic coefficient for several possible recording
geometries, a c-cut LiNbO3 crystal is a better choice for holographic disk memory. When
LiNbO3 disk rotates around a-axis or b-axis, the coupling between two eigenwaves could happen
and multiple gratings will be constructed. Consequently, the diffraction efficiency of each
hologram cannot be easily controlled. When LiNbO3 disk rotate around c-axis and both recording
beams are TE waves, transmission holograms should be avoided because there would be no
diffraction at some specific rotating angle. 2k-reflection holograms constructed by two TE
waves have a uniform distribution of effective electro-optic coefficients with respect to rotating
angle. When LiNbO3 disk rotate around c-axis and both recording beams are TM waves,
fluctuation of effective electro-optic coefficients with respect to rotating angle of the disk for
transmission holograms always exists. The effective electro-optic coefficients with respect to
rotating angle for holograms constructed by two TM waves could remain the same value when
the holographic grating is a 2k-reflection type. In conclusions, no matter two writing beams are
TE waves or TM waves, a 2k-reflection hologram in a c-cut LiNbO3 crystal could be used for
obtaining equal effective electro-optic coefficients in a LiNbO3 holographic disk memory.

ABSTRACT
A new multiplexing method, spatial-phase multiplexing technique, for holographic storage is
presented. Spatial-phase multiplexing is a special angular multiplexing based on random
phase encoding through a phase mask. Experimental and theoretical results show that we can
effectively enhance the angular selectivity of reference waves. The distinguish advantage of
the proposed technique is that no duplication issues of phase masks should be considered in
the reading system. When the memory of spatial-phase multiplexed holograms is removed
and is accessed by another reading system, only plane waves should be generated for the
readout as the angular multiplexing does.

1. Introduction
Using random phase reference waves in a holographic storage system is an effective way to
improve the multiplexing selectivity [1-4]. The technique of random phase encoding may be
helpful to increase storage capacity especially for some holographic polymer materials with high
dynamic range but cannot be made arbitrarily thick. One convenient way to generate random
phase waves or speckle reference waves is using a random phase mask such as a ground glass.
However, the characteristic of the random phase encoding is not only for holographic storage but
also for optical encryption [1,5-6]. In the retrieval of the stored information, the same ground
glass should be used and its position is quite critical [1]. When the holographic memory is
removed and is accessed by another reading system, a mask with the same phase profile is
required to reproduce the same speckle reference waves [7]. Therefore, the duplication of phase
key becomes important and necessary. A good solution for duplication is using a spatial light
modulator (SLM) to replace the phase mask. However, using a SLM may result in an increase in
the cost for the read-only-memory system.
Here we present a novel method, spatial-phase multiplexing, that makes possible a significant
enhancement in angular selectivity. Spatial-phase multiplexing is a special angular multiplexing
based on random phase encoding through a random phase mask. The multiplexing method is
named as “spatial-phase”because the orthogonal property between each reference beam is
induced by phase encoding across the spatial distribution on the phase mask, which comes from
the discrete angular spectrum of incident plane waves [8]. In comparison with correlation shift
multiplexing [1-3] and spatial-phase multiplexing, the former case has advantages over the later
case in that it does not use complex optics such as 4-f lens systems or Galvo mirror. However,
the distinguish advantage of the proposed technique is that no duplication issues of phase masks

between reading beam and writing beam is a small angle tilt  of the incident plane wave on
the ground glass, we can express the reading beam as

We have investigated and compared the angular selectivity for transmission geometry between
spatial-phase multiplexed holograms and traditional angle-multiplexed holograms. In both
storage architectures as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), a He-Cd laser at 442 nm was used as the light
source. A Fe: LiNbO3 crystal with dimensions of mmmmmm 21010  was used as the
recording medium. The signal beam was a plane wave and the incident angle was kept at o30 in
the air. The whole crystal was illuminated with the collimated signal beam. In Fig. 1(b), a
collimated reference wave was normal incident on the ground glass. A mask was attached on the
ground glass to control the illumination area on the ground glass. Three masks with different
aperture size were attached on the ground glass in turn for three different experimental
measurements. The aperture sizes of three masks in width ( w ) and height ( h ) were

We calculated the NSR for the 100n hologram among 1001 stored holograms by numerically
evaluating Eq. (8) with nm442 , cmz 10  , mmt 2 , o5.18 , cmF 5 , N=750, and
M=500. The NSR result at the output plane is shown in Fig. 4(a). Notice that the maximum NSR
occurs at the x boundary of the output plane. The value of NSR for each reconstruction in these
1001 stored holograms almost keeps the same. When those parameters are used, the storing
number is 1001, the width of mask is approximately equal to mmw 10 , and angular selectivity
is o0025.0 . In the same condition ( mmt 2 , o5.18 ), the Bragg selectivity for angular
multiplexing is about o038.0 . If the total accessible angular range in a system is o20 , only 525
pages of images can be stored in this material for angular multiplexing. If spatial-phase
multiplexing is used for storage, 8000 multiplexing numbers can be achieved
( 8000

) in this system. However, discrete phase pixel and finite pixel number will
affect the orthogonal property of reference beam and inherently limit the actual available storing
numbers for the proposed techniques. Using the simulation parameters described above, the NSR
can be smaller than one as long as storing number 2M+1 not exceeding the pixel number 2N+1 in
this case. Despite of this limitation, the estimated storage capacity for spatial-phase multiplexing
is 2N+1=1501 pages in this case and is almost triple of that for angular multiplexing.
5. Conclusions
In summary, we have introduced the technique of spatial-phase multiplexing. Experimental and
theoretical results show that we can effectively enhance the angular selectivity of reference plane
waves. In comparison with correlation shift multiplexing [1-3], selectivity can be enhanced in
both techniques. However, in our technique, each random phase mask on a holographic memory
cell could be unique and no duplication issues of phase masks should be considered.
Since total accessible angular range in a system is limited, available number for multiplexing
becomes the primary constraint on storage capacity for those materials cannot be made
arbitrarily thick. Increasing storage capacity in thin materials is also achievable if a hybrid
multiplexing method combining various multiplexing techniques is used [13]. In comparison
with hybrid multiplexing, our technique increases storage capacity by enhancing angular
selectivity for a reference plane wave, and no additional multiplexing mechanism is needed. The
technique proposed here offers the possibility to increase the allowed multiplexing number until
the noise becomes the primary constraint on storage capacity.

Abstract
A speckle-multiplexing scheme with enhanced angular selectivity for holographic storage is proposed. Angular selectivity in the pro-
posed holographic storage system is theoretically and experimentally investigated. We ﬁnd the eﬀect of speckle reference wave on angular
selectivity strongly depends on the techniques to perform multiplexing for holographic storage. Angular selectivity of a holographic stor-
age system can be eﬀectively enhanced as long as angular deviation of reading wave induces a lateral displacement of the speckle pattern
on the hologram plane. When angular deviation of reading wave only induces a speckle wavefront tilt on the hologram plane, the speckle
wave is not helpful to enhance the angular selectivity and the angular selectivity becomes to depend on material thickness (Bragg con-
dition) only.

1. Introduction
Holographic storage has received increasing attention
owing to its potential in access rate and high storage capac-
ity [1–3]. To achieve the theoretical storage density, various
storage conﬁgurations and multiplexing techniques are
proposed to store multiple images in a medium [4–9].
Among these multiplexing methods, using speckle refer-
ence waves or random phase reference waves in a holo-
graphic storage system is an eﬀective way to improve the
shifting selectivity [4,10–12]. In fact, the improved shifting
selectivity strongly depends on the transverse speckle size
of the random phase wave or speckle wave. If the lateral
displacement of a speckle wavefront exceeds the speckle
size, the reference speckle waves become decorrelation
to the original one, and multiplexing of holograms can be
achieved. Random phase waves or speckle waves can be
generated by using random phase masks, ground glasses,
spatial light modulators, multimode ﬁbers, and multimode
ﬁber bundles [4,10–14]. This technique may be helpful to
increase storage capacity especially for thinner holographic
materials that lead to worse Bragg selectivity.
Contrary to shifting selectivity, Jeong and Lee [10] have
been proven that speckle wave itself makes little contribu-
tion to the enhancement in angular selectivity of holograms
[10]. In the speckle-multiplexing scheme as analyzed by
Jeong et al., the angular deviation of reading speckle wave
only induces a wavefront tilt on the hologram plane.
Accordingly, the speckle wave is not helpful to enhance
the angular selectivity. However, in another speckle-multi-
plexing scheme proposed by Markov [15], the angular
selectivity of the system is improved because the angular
deviation of reading wave is equivalent to the synchronous
rotation and shift of the speckle wave. The operation in
this scheme is implemented by using a piezoelectric actua-
tor to tilt the hologram.

The two sinc-functions in Eq. (5) are induced by the ran-
dom phase plate and by the ﬁnite size of the hologram,
respectively. The former is the diﬀraction due to the
destructive interference induced through both of
the ground glasses in the writing and reading processes.
The latter is the diﬀraction due to the destructive interfer-
ence induced by diﬀraction in a volume medium, and it
leads to Bragg condition. The key parameters for ﬁrst zero
diﬀraction are d and t. Here we deﬁne shifting tolerance as
the displacement for ﬁrst zero diﬀraction obtained from the
two sinc-functions in Eq. (5). The shifting selectivity
depends on the smaller one of Dxd and Dxt where
Dxd ¼ kz0d ; ð6Þ
and
Dxt ¼ kz0t  tan a : ð7Þ
Once the speckle wave as described as Eq. (1) is angular
deviated on the plane of hologram to read the hologram,
the angular deviation of reading wave will cause a wave-
front tilt of speckle wave. Consequently, angular sensitivity
induced by Bragg condition owing to the wavefront tilt is
obtained through
Dht ¼ Dxtz0 ¼
k
t  tan a : ð8Þ
If the speckle wave is angular deviated at the plane of
ground glass, and it could be equivalent to a lateral dis-
placement of the speckle pattern on the plane of hologram,
the angular sensitivity induced by speckle wave is obtained
through
Dhd ¼ Dxdz0 ¼
k
d
: ð9Þ
If the angular deviation of speckle wave does not cause
any lateral displacement of the speckle pattern on the plane
of hologram, there will be no contribution of speckle waves
on the angular selectivity. Accordingly, the eﬀect of speckle
pattern is not always helpful to enhance the angular selec-
tivity. The condition will be explained in detail in the fol-
lowing two sections.
3. Angular selectivity of speckle reference waves
In this section, a proper speckle-multiplexing scheme
with enhanced angular selectivity is proposed. The angular
selectivity of speckle reference wave to perform multiplex-
ing storage in this system is analyzed. Consider the scheme
of speckle angular multiplexing as shown in Fig. 2, the
hologram is constructed by a signal plane wave and a
speckle reference wave. A collimated wave is normal inci-
dent on the ground glass to generate a speckle wave. The
speckle wave is reﬂected by a mirror and then normal inci-
dent on a holographic recording crystal. The distance
between ground glass and mirror is s and distance between
mirror and hologram is z0  s. In the reading process, if the
mirror is angular rotated with Dh, the angular deviation of
reﬂection angle will become 2Dh. For the hologram, it is
equivalent to a laterally shifting of the ground glass with
a displacement Dx = s Æ 2Dh. The reading wave become

Consequently, angular sensitivity induced by Bragg con-

and angular sensitivity induced by speckle wave is obtained
through
Dhd ¼ kz0

The angular selectivity depends on the smaller one of
Dhd and Dht. If the dimension of ground glass d is chosen
to be larger than t Æ tana, the angular selectivity becomes
to depend mainly on Eq. (14). Once the ground glass as
shown in Fig. 2 is removed, the hologram becomes to be
generated by a reference plane wave. Angular selectivity
for a reference plane wave can be estimated by Eq. (8).
For k = 442 nm, z0 = 20 cm, s = 10 cm, d = 10 mm, t =

The signal beam was a plane wave and the incident angle
was kept at 30 in the air. The whole crystal was illumi-
nated with the collimated signal beam. A mask was
attached on the ground glass to control the illumination
area on the ground glass. Two masks with diﬀerent aper-
ture size were attached on the ground glass in turn for
two diﬀerent experimental measurements. The aperture
sizes of these two masks in width (d) and height (h) were
5 mm · 10 mm, and 10 mm · 10 mm, respectively. The dis-
tance between ground glass and hologram is 10 cm.
Accordingly, the parameters required for Eq. (17) in simu-
lations are k = 514.5 nm, t = 2 mm, and a = 12.9. The
autocorrelation length of the ground glass is about 1 lm
such that the whole crystal will be illuminated with the
speckle reference wave no matter what aperture size of
mask is used. The measured angular selectivity is shown
in Fig. 5. The theoretical simulations of angular selectivity
for plane wave and speckle wave based on Eq. (17) are also
shown. Our theoretical model can predict the experimental
measurements well. We can ﬁnd the angular selectivity for
plane wave and speckle wave almost keep the same. Conse-
quently, the speckle wave is not helpful to improve the
angular selectivity. The reason for the non-enhancement
in angular selectivity is that the reading speckle wavefront
described in this section is only tilted on the hologram
plane. However, the propagation direction of reading
speckle wave described in Section 3 is modiﬁed by a mirror
such that the speckle wavefront is laterally shifted on holo-
gram plane. Accordingly, as long as the angular deviation
of readout speckle wave induces a lateral displacement of
the random phase pattern on the hologram plane, the
angular selectivity can be enhanced. If our purpose is using
speckle wave to enhance angular selectivity, multiplexing
techniques that will be equivalent to only speckle wave-
front tilt on hologram plane are not suggested.
5. Discussions on the implications of the system design
In a practical holographic storage system, the achievable
density is limited by several parameters, including the
dynamic range of material [17], noises of the diﬀraction,
and the geometric limitation, which relates to the maxi-
mum multiplexing number allowed for holographic storage
in geometry. The proposed speckle-multiplexing in this
paper directly addresses the geometric limits of a volume
holographic storage system. If the total accessible angular
range in the system is X, the maximum number available
for storage is N = X/Dhd, where Dhd is the angular devia-
tion required for two adjacent holograms. A smaller angu-
lar deviation is, a larger storing number N can be obtained.
The proposed technique here eﬀectively increases the avail-
able multiplexing number for storage and oﬀers the possi-
bility to increase the capacity. However, the possible
storage capacity for this system does not increase simply
in proportion to the improved angular selectivity. Dynamic
range of recording material and noises of reconstruction
hologram are the other important factors should be consid-
ered. Generally speaking, dynamic range has a strong
impact on storage capacity that can be achieved. After
exposure schedule for volume holographic storage, the dif-
fraction eﬃciency of a hologram is proportional to 1/M2,
where M is the storing number of holograms in the same
volume. For successful reconstruction of the stored data,
the diﬀraction eﬃciency of a hologram must be higher than
other sources of noise. A material with high dynamic range
fundamentally oﬀers the possibility to increase the stored
number and simultaneously keep the diﬀraction intensity
of each hologram larger than the diﬀraction noise. Accord-
ingly, when dynamic range is suﬃcient large, increasing the
allowed multiplexing number is helpful to increase the stor-
age capacity until the noise becomes the primary constraint
[18]. Diﬀraction noises in volume holograms are mainly
induced by cross talk, scattering, and noise grating formed
during multiplexing storage. Cross talk noises could be dif-
ferent for various multiplexing techniques. No matter what
kinds of multiplexing is used for holographic storage, cross
talk noises increase with the numbers of stored holograms.
Related research has shown that random phase multiplex-
ing has worse performance on cross talk noise than other
multiplexing techniques [19]. Due to the random nature
of speckle wave, speckle multiplexing or random phase
multiplexing relies on the spatial correlation properties of
the reference beams and they are not truly orthogonal to
each other. For thin recording material, as the number
of speckle-multiplexed holograms increases, the other
recorded holograms are still reconstructed with a widely
distributed but ﬁnite amount of diﬀraction. The buildup
of cross talk will appear as a speckle background illumina-
tion in each reconstruction due to the spatially distributed
random phases. For thick recording material, the buildup
of cross talk in Bragg selectivity direction can be sup-
pressed owing to Bragg eﬀect. However, the suppress eﬀect
depends on the material’s thickness, the angle between two

ABSTRACT
A multiplexing scheme in volume holograms with a spherical reference wave by rotating a
mirror is presented. Diffraction angular selectivity of the mirror in the proposed holographic
storage system is theoretically and experimentally investigated. The spherical reference waves
in the presented multiplexing scheme can be replaced with plane reference waves; however,
angular selectivity of the mirror with a plane reference wave is higher than that with a
spherical reference wave in the system. Angular selectivity of the mirror using a spherical
reference wave in the system can be increased by decreasing the distance between the mirror
and the hologram. Contrary to spherical reference waves, angular selectivity using a plane
reference wave keeps the same in the system. Though using spherical reference waves
generating a lower angular selectivity, it also offers larger total accessible angular range for
reference beams. Accordingly, using spherical reference waves in the proposed system will
not sacrifice the storage capacity.

1. Introduction
Holographic storage has received increasing attention owing to its potential in access rate and
high storage capacity [1-3]. To achieve the theoretical storage density, various storage
configurations and multiplexing techniques are proposed for storing multiple images in a
medium [4-11]. Among these methods, angular multiplexing is a widely used scheme [1, 4-5].
This scheme can use either a plane reference wave or a spherical reference for each stored pages
in volume holograms with different incident angles. It has been proven that a spherical reference
wave almost produce the same Bragg angular selectivity as a plane reference wave [12-13].
Because a collimating system is usually required for generating a plane wave, it is believed that
angle-multiplexed holograms can be realized in compact systems with spherical reference waves.
Angular shift of reference waves in angle-multiplexed holograms can be realized by rotating the
recording material or actually by changing the propagation direction of the reference wave itself.
Owing to the refraction effect, rotation of holographic medium during recording process will
induce a lateral displacement of reconstruction signal on the detector plane. Accordingly, rotating
the hologram to perform angular multiplexing is seldom used for a holographic storage system.
Instead of that, angular multiplexing is usually implemented by changing the propagation
direction of the reference wave itself. For a plane reference wave, the widely used technique to
control the propagation direction is using a Galvo mirror or a 4-f imaging system [1, 5]. However,
a Galvo mirror or a 4-f imaging system also leads to complex optical scheme for storage system.

We can find angular tolerance of the mirror with a spherical wave depends on the parameters d

Once the spherical wave in the Fig. 1(a) is replaced with a reference plane wave, the reference
wave becomes a normal incident plane wave. The normal incident plane reference wave can be
expressed as

resolution of 4106.1  degree. The propagation direction of the reference wave was controlled
by rotating the stage. The whole crystal was illuminated with the spherical reference wave. The
distance between the focusing spot of lens L1 and the mirror M1 was 10cm. The distance
between mirror M1 and LiNbO3 crystal, d , was either 10 cm or 20cm. These optical
arrangements described above were used in the system for generating the same parameters
nm442 , cms 10 , mmt 2 , and o9.12 for the experimental measurements and their
corresponding simulation.
In the recording process, shutter S1 was opened. The intensity of signal beam and reference
beam were both 5 2cmmw . The exposure time for each hologram was 10 minutes. When the
index gratings were recorded in the crystal, we closed shutter S1. We rotated the mirror M1 to
change the incident angle of the reading beam and measured the diffraction optical power. The
diffraction signal was detected by using a power detector. A lens was placed in front of the
detector to collect the whole diffraction power. The measured diffraction intensities with respect
to the angular deviation of the mirror M1 are also shown in Fig 2. For plane reference waves, the
experimental setup for angular selectivity measurement was the same with that shown in Fig.3,
except the Lens L1 were removed. The same measurement procedures described above were
repeated. The measured result of angular selectivity of the mirror with a plane reference wave is
also shown in Fig 2. In comparison with the measurements and the theoretical calculations, we
find that the theoretical calculation can predict the diffraction behavior of the experimental
measurement well. We note the angular selectivity curves in Fig 2 do not exhibit well-defined
zeros. High exposure energies tend to modify the cosine profile of the refractive index in the
hologram. The experimental curves prove that using a plane reference wave performs higher
angular selectivity than using a spherical wave in the system. The results also show that for
spherical reference waves, when the distance between mirror and crystal becomes larger, the
angular selectivity becomes worse. Accordingly, angular selectivity using spherical reference
waves in this system can be effectively increased by decreasing the distance between mirror and
crystal. Contrary to spherical reference waves, the theoretical analysis in section 2 has shown the
angular selectivity is independent of the distance between mirror and crystal. No matter what the
distance between mirror and hologram is, the angular selectivity of the mirror using plane
reference waves in the system will keep the same.
Before a comparison with the results of Hsieh (Reference 4, Figure 2a), several experimental
conditions should be clarified. Though recording geometries of both experiments are similar, it is
worth noticing that in our system the reference beam is normal incident and signal bema is
propagated with an oblique angle, but these experimental arrangements are reverse in the system
of Hsieh. In addition, the experimental results of Hsieh represent the angular selectivity of
incident reference wave inside the recording medium, which can be defined as [10]

contribute to the recording, the angular sweeping range cannot exceed the hologram area. As
shown in Fig. 4(a), when the reflection mirror is rotated, the reference beam wavefont in the
hologram plane will be shifted laterally. For a Fourier hologram, the mirror can be rotated in
clockwise or in counterclockwise direction until the reference beam wavefont cannot cover half
of the hologram. Accordingly, the angular range of the plane reference waves can be
approximately estimated as d
D 2 , where D is the diameter of the plane wave and d
is the distance between mirror and the crystal. And the total accessible angular range available
for angular rotation of mirror in the system becomes d

where p is angular selectivity of the rotation mirror with reference plane wave, and p2

In the case with a spherical reference waves in our proposed scheme, the total accessible angular
range is limited the numerical aperture (NA) of the spherical wave itself. As shown in Fig. 4 (b),
we also assume the spherical reference wave can span from  to  in the system, and
accordingly 2 . In our system design, the spherical reference beam is larger than the signal
beam, and the spherical reference beam is sweeping across the surface of the holographic
material for multiplexing storage. Since only the overlapping area of reference wave and signal
can contribute to the recording, the angular sweeping range cannot exceed the hologram area. It
is the same as described above, for a Fourier hologram, the mirror can be rotated in clockwise or
in counterclockwise direction until the reference beam wavefont cannot cover half of the
hologram. Accordingly, the angular range of the spherical reference waves can be approximately
estimated as d

spherical reference wave with a higher numerical aperture in this system could effectively
increase the storing number. We can find as long as sNA2 in Eq. (16) is larger than D in Eq.
(15), the storage capacity of the system using spherical reference waves could larger than that
using plane reference waves. Generally, the diameter of a plane reference wave ( D ) is usually
limited by the aperture of a collimating lens. As shown in Fig. 4, a spherical wave with the same
NA are used to generate a plane reference wave and a spherical reference wave. We set the
diameter of the plane reference wave D = sNA2 . The angular sweeping range for plane

are quite different. As far as we know this scheme has not yet been investigated. We find that
angular selectivity of the mirror using a spherical reference wave in the system can be increased
by decreasing the distance between the mirror and the hologram. The results also show that using
plane reference in this system always has higher angular selectivity than using spherical
reference waves in this system. However, using spherical reference waves in the proposed
system also offers larger accessible angular range for reference beams. Accordingly, using
spherical reference waves in the proposed system will not sacrifice the storage capacity. An
additional advantage of using spherical waves is that it does not use complex optics such as 4-f
lens systems. Accordingly, a relative compact system can be achieved. In comparison with
convention shit multiplexing in which the reference wave is spherical but a rotating mirror is not
used, a potential advantage of our proposed scheme is that higher storage number can be
obtained. The research results on angular selectivity offer important information for whom
interested in realizing angle-multiplexed holographic storage systems with spherical reference
waves.
