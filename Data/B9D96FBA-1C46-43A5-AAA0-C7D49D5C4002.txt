low-cost and a high-yield method for producing nanowires 
from different materials [17]. However, there are some 
drawbacks associated with most electrodeposition 
processes, including lack of nanowire length uniformity 
and length control. Another major challenge with 
electrodeposition is that the success of the process is highly 
dependent on finding the appropriate chemical precursor. A 
different approach that has been utilized for fabricating 
metallic nanowires and which overcomes most of the 
problems associated with deposition processes is based on 
an injection method. In this method, a molten metal is 
impregnated into the nanochannels of the AAO template. 
Various metallic nanowires (Sn, Bi, Al, In) with diameters 
larger than 200 nm have been fabricated by the injection 
method [18]. Recently, the use of a hightemperature gas 
pressure chamber has enabled the injection of bismuth (Bi) 
melt into AAO templates as small as 13 nm in diameter 
[19-20]. The smallest diameter nanochannel that can be 
filled is constrained by the maximum pressure the gas 
chamber can sustain and operate at safely. When a pressure 
higher than the chambermaximumis necessary, wetting 
agents with poor solubility in the molten metal are added to 
lower the surface tension of the molten metal and hence 
reduce the required injection pressure [20]. This article 
presents a hydraulic pressure injection method as an 
alternative to the aforementioned gas pressure injection, 
capable of achieving higher pressure ranges to inject 
molten Sn into nanochannels as small as 15 nm in diameter, 
without the aid of a wetting agent. The fabrication of Sn 
nanowires and their structural characterization are the focal 
points of this paper.  
 
2. Experimental procedure 
2.1. Fabrication of AAO template 
Anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) templates with 
average channel diameter of 60 and 15 nm and thickness of 
10 µm were fabricated by one-step anodization. The 
templates were generated by anodizing a commercial 
aluminium (Al, 99.7%) substrate. The 60 nm pore diameter 
template (denoted as AAO60 hereafter) was then fabricated 
by anodizing the polished Al substrate at 40 V in 3 vol% 
oxalic acid. The anodization for the 15 nm pore diameter 
template (denoted as AAO15 hereafter) was performed at 
18 V in 10 vol% sulfuric acid. More detailed description of 
the process can be found elsewhere [21]. It should be noted 
that the Al substrate was not removed after anodization; it 
was kept to serve as padding for the fragile porous AAO 
template during the injection process. 
2.2. Fabrication of nanowires by hydraulic pressure injection 
The nanowires were fabricated by vacuum melting 
and pressure injection of the Sn melt into the nanochannels 
of the AAO template. The vacuum hydraulic pressure 
injection set-up has been described previously [22]. The 
external pressure for the AAO60 and AAO15 templates 
was estimated to be~350 and~1400 bar, respectively. For 
the fabrication of Sn nanowires, a disc-shaped Sn foil was 
placed on the top side of the AAO template and both were 
put inside a mould. The mould, containing the AAO/Sn foil, 
was then placed inside a vacuum chamber and heated up to 
the melting temperature of Sn (230℃) using a hot plate. 
The hot chamber was removed from the hot plate and 
pressure was applied on the melt, through the sliding 
column of the chamber, using a hydraulic jack to 
impregnate the molten Sn into the nanochannels of the 
AAO template. The chamber was immediately placed in 
cold water to cool down for a period of 10~15 min to 
solidify the impregnant inside the nanochannels.  
The filling ratio of the hydraulic injection method was 
investigated by examining the top and bottom surfaces of 
the Sn-filled AAO template. The top face of the AAO 
template was studied after mechanically removing (peeling 
by hand) the excess surrounding bulk Sn from the top 
surface of the Sn-filled AAO template. To examine the 
bottom surface of the AAO template, the Al substrate was 
first removed with a CuCl2-based solution [23] which 
revealed the barrier layer that capped the nanochannels. 
The barrier layer and a few nanometres of AAO template 
were etched away using NaOH solution which exposed the 
nanowire diameter decreases from 60 to 15 nm. Various 
researchers [23–26] have shown that low-dimensional 
crystals, including metallic nanocrystals, embedded in a 
matrix can melt below or above the melting point of their 
corresponding bulk crystal. The embedded nanocrystals 
could be spherical particles, thin films, disc-like particles or 
nanowires. The enhancement or reduction of the melting 
temperature was found to depend on the nature of the 
interface structure between the embedded nanocrystals and 
thematrix. For an incoherent interface, where there is no 
lattice matching between the two interfacing phases, the 
melting point was found to decrease as a function of the size 
of nanocrystals. Both theoretical predictions and 
experimental results for Sn nanocrystals indicate that the 
reduction in the melting point was especially significant for 
nanocrystals whose radius was less than 15 nm [25]. In the 
current study, the interface between the AAO template and 
the Sn nanowires is incoherent because there is no 
interaction between the two phases since the AAO template 
is essentially stable at temperatures lower than 800 ◦C [26].      
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study the phase 
and crystal structure of the Sn nanowire arrays. The XRD 
experiment was performed on the bottom face of the 
AAO/nanowire composite after removing the Al and barrier 
layer. The XRD patterns, as shown in figure 5, were indexed 
to the body-centred-tetragonal (bct) β-Sn structure. All the 
observed peaks, both for the AAO60 and AAO15 samples, 
were found to match very closely to the standard 
polycrystalline β-Sn (JCPDF, 4-673). For the AAO60 
sample, the intensity for (200) was almost 4.0 times higher 
than that of the secondary peak (101). This is higher than 
expected as the ratio of the intensities of (200) and (101) for 
polycrystalline β-Sn is 1.1. On the other hand, for the 
AAO15 sample, the relative intensities of the peaks were 
very similar to that from the standard polycrystalline β-Sn 
with no preferred orientation. The reason for this in not clear 
yet, but further investigation is underway. A transmission 
electronmicroscope (TEM) was employed to further study 
the morphology, crystallinity and growth orientation of 
individual nanowires. TEM micrographs taken from various 
randomly selected 60 nm diameter Sn nanowires revealed 
that the nanowires were dense, continuous, and uniform in 
diameter along the length of the nanowire. A typical TEM 
micrograph of a randomly selected individual nanowire is 
shown in figure 6. Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) 
patterns taken along the length of a 60 nm diameter 
nanowire showed the same single set of ED patterns along 
the length of the wire, verifying single crystallinity of the 
nanowires. After analysing several SAED patterns from 
randomly selected nanowires, it was concluded that although 
other directions were observed, the growth direction for the 
majority of the wires was along [100]. This is basically in 
good agreement with results reported previously where it 
was found that the majority of the Sn nanowires synthesized 
by electrochemical deposition also had preferred [100] 
growth direction. From the XRD and TEM observations, it 
can be deduced that the nanowires in the AAO60 sample are 
predominantly oriented along the [100] direction. In addition, 
from the current results and earlier reported results it appears 
that regardless of the fabrication process [100] may be the 
preferred growth direction for Sn nanowires in the 40–160 
nm diameter range.  
 
4. Summary 
Sn nanowires with 15 and 60 nmin diameter were 
successfully fabricated by injecting molten Sn into the 
nanochannels of an AAO template by applying hydraulic 
pressure. SEM and TEM examination of the Sn nanowires 
showed that the nanowires were dense and continuous, with 
uniform wire diameter along their entire length. Structural 
characterization on the 60nm diameter Sn nanowire arrays 
and freestanding nanowires through XRD and using a TEM 
revealed that the nanowires are highly oriented along the 
[100] direction. DSC results showed that the melting point 
decreased with the decrease of the nanowire diameter.  
The major limitation of this method arises mainly due 
to the Al substrate, whose melting temperature is 660 ◦C.
