1. Introduction 
  With increasing environmental concerns, one of the routes toward sustainability is the way 
of zero-waste that proposes “no waste generation” in place of “waste management”. For the 
environmental protection and resource utilization, the disposal of wastes which contain 
valuable metals is of great concern. At present, several technologies have been applied to 
dispose of wastes, including chemical methods (such as hydrometallurgical processes), 
physical methods (such as stabilization and encapsulation), and thermal methods (such as 
pyrolysis, combustion or incineration) [1, 2]. In recent years, thermal method has been the 
most widely applied technology. However, some undesirabled toxic air pollutants (such as 
volatile metals, dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) may be generated from the 
thermal treatment. Moreover, metals still exist in the thermal treated residue might be easily 
leached out and cause secondary pollution in the environment. Therefore, this three-year 
project focuses on developing procedures for valuable metals recovery from wastes, and then 
develops control technologies for toxic air pollutants from the recovering process.  
  Two kinds of wastes which have highly recycling potentials were investigated in this study. 
The first kind of waste is waste printed circuit boards (P-CBs). In general, P-CBs consist of 
electronic parts, glass-fiber resin substrates and copper sheet, and their wastes are promising 
as secondary resource for valuable metals such as gold and copper [1]. In addition, 
brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are widely used in P-CBs to achieve fire safety demands 
[3-5]. Recently, some developed technologies have been applied to dispose of P-CBs. The 
electronic parts and glass-fiber resin substrates of P-CBs are treated by incineration or 
combustion, and the metals are recovered by hydrometallurgical [1, 3, 5]. However, the 
polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs) and debenzofurans (PBDFs) may be generated 
from the thermal treatment. The World Health Organization reported that PBDD/Fs are 
pollutants similar to PCDD/Fs in their persistence and toxicity, and that humans and 
environment should be protected from these compounds [6, 7].  
  The second kind of waste is the waste hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts. Catalysts are 
mostly used in petroleum refining industries for catalyzing and accelerating the HDS reaction. 
The catalysts typically consist of molybdenum supported on an alumina with cobalt or nickel 
promoters [8]. Considering the presence of high concentrations of valuable metals, e.g., Mo 
(up to 11%), Ni (up to 5%) and V (up to 11%) in waste HDS catalysts, the hydrometallurgy 
process have been considered a potential way on metal-recovery treatment. For the 
hydrometallurgy process, the contaminants (residues oil, carbon and sulfur) present on the 
 6
Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, V and Zn, were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 
spectrometry (Jobin-Yvon JY-38 Plus ICP-AES).  
2.2 Laboratory melting system 
  The laboratory melting system consists of a high temperature furnace, a secondary 
combustion chamber and one set of air pollution control devices (APCDs) including cooling 
unit (collected the condensed water of volatile gas), filter (collected particles) and three-stage 
glass PUF cartridge adsorption (collected gaseous phase compound) as illustrated in Figure 1. 
The specifications of the melting system are as follows. The high temperature furnace has a 
width of 210 mm, a length of 280 mm and a height of 220 mm in size, with a maximum 
temperature of 1600˚C and the heat loading is 6.6 kW. The furnace with an inner 
graphite-crucible, on the top of this crucible is a cone-shaped cap hood for collecting volatile 
gases and metals emitted from the graphite-crucible during the high-temperature melting 
process. The inner-diameter of the bottom of the cap hood is approximately 3-8% of 
magnitude higher than the outer-diameter of graphite-crucible. The inner space of 
graphite-crucible can be alternatively delivered by certain gases (Air, Ar, N2 or O2) or no gas. 
The design of a small hole at the side wall of bottom at graphite-crucible can be connected 
with an Al2O3 tube to the outer gas supply sources. The volatile gases, metals and particulates 
collected by the cap hood will be delivered with an Al2O3 tube to the secondary combustion 
chamber for further combustion or introduced to the APCDs. The secondary combustion 
chamber has an inside diameter of 50 mm and a length of 1000 mm in size, with a maximum 
temperature of 1300˚C and the heat loading is 6.6 kW. The flue gas cooling unit with indirect 
water cooling has an inside diameter of 25 mm and a length of 1700 mm in size. The diameter 
of filter was 51 mm and each stage of the three-stage PUF cartridge adsorption has a length of 
130 mm. In order to ensure that the gaseous PBDD/Fs are insignificant, three separate tests 
were performed by measuring PBDD/Fs in the 3rd stage of PUF cartridge and less than 2% 
PBDD/Fs mass was found at the 3rd stage of PUF cartridge. We already took out a patent on 
this melting system. The patent number was M264023. 
2.3 PBDD/F Sampling and analysis 
  The waste flexible P-CBs were first cut into small pieces (ca. 5×5×0.5 mm) and metals on 
the surface were stripped off by aqua regia extraction. The waste P-CB was pretreated in order 
to prevent metals corroding the equipment. Experimental sample placed inside a 
graphite-crucible was put in the furnace; the furnace temperature was than increased to 850˚C 
or 1200˚C at 6˚C min-1 (held for 30 min), and the secondary combustion chamber at 1200˚C.

divided into three categories: 6 low molecular weight PAHs (LM-PAHs, 2–3-ring), 4 median 
molecular weight PAHs (MM-PAHs, 4-ring) and 11 high molecular weight PAHs (HM-PAHs, 
5–7-ring). In addition, to assess the carcinogenic potency of a given PAH compound, the 
benzo(a)pyrene equivalent concentration (BaPeq) was calculated with its toxic equivalent 
factor (TEF) and its concentration. The carcinogenic potency of the total PAHs (i.e., Total 
BaPeq) was estimated as the sum of BaPeq of the 21 individual PAHs.  
2.5 Leaching procedures 
  Leaching experiments were carried out with a given amount of the thermal treated catalysts 
in acidic solution (100 mL). The leachate was 50 mL of 70% HNO3, 25 mL of 96% H2SO4 
and 25 mL of 37% HCl mixture. All the concentrated acids used in this experiment were 
reagent grade. The experiments were accomplished in Teflon breakers at 70 °C over a time 
range of 2 hours. After finishing the reaction time, the solid residue was filtered through a 
Whatman 42 filter and diluted to 100 mL with 0.5 mol L-1 HNO3. The resulting filtrate had a 
dark green color. Concentrations of main elements, including Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Pb, 
V and Zn in the filtrate were measured by ICP-MS. The batch experiment was repeated triple.  
2.6 Electrolysis 
  The experimental equipment used in this study consists of a power supply, an electrolytic 
cell, two electrodes (anode and cathode) and a pump. A fluidized-bed electrolytic cell with a 
nonconductive bed medium was used in this study. A Sheet of stainless electrode with a 
dimension of 70 mm (width) × 80 mm (length) ×2 mm (depth) were used as the cathode; and 
an iridium oxide mesh electrode with the same dimension were used as the anode. The bed 
medium was nonconductive glass spheres of 0.5 mm in diameter.   
  The leaching solution (1500 mL) was used as electrolyte in each batch for metal recovery 
and was adjusted to a pH value of 2 to 5 with 10N NaOH solution. Then, the electrolyte 
introduced into the electrolytic cell from the bottom by a pump. The flowrate of the 
electrolyte pumped into the electrolytic cell was 5000 mL/min. Two electrodes (anode and 
cathode) were connected with a power supply. Current was adjusted to 2.0 A and held 
constant for each run with a retention time of 2 h. Electrolyte pH was monitored by pH meter 
(Jenco 6173) in the electrolysis process. 10 mL of the electrolyte was sampled at an interval 
of 0.5 h. Concentrations of main elements in the electrolyte, precipitate and electrode were 
measured by ICP-MS.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
 10
novo synthesis is the dominant mechanism of dioxin formation.  
When compared with that of none CaO present (Table 2), the total-PBDD/Fs were 
decomposed by one to two orders of magnitude. In general, acid gases (HBr) were generated 
during thermolysis while the presence of bromine [13, 14]. A possible neutralization between 
CaO and HBr could explain these changes. The possible mechanism between CaO and HBr is 
as follows : 
OHCaBrHBrCaO 222 +→+                                                 (1) 
It shows that the reaction between HBr and CaO formed the solid phase product (CaBr2), 
which was less volatile and collected in the bottom ashes. Thus, the addition of CaO is 
effective to adsorb HBr, resulting in the inhibition of PBDD/Fs synthesis.  
3.1.4 Removal efficiency of PBDD/Fs by APCDs  
  The removal efficiency of PBDD/Fs by APCDs is calculated as follows: 
removal efficiency (%) in cooling unit = A / (A+B+C) × 100% ; in filter = B / (B+C) × 100%, 
where A is the emission factor of PBDD/Fs collected by cooling unit, B is the emission factor 
of those collected by filter and C is the emission factor of those collected by PUF/resin 
cartridge. The removal efficiencies of total-PBDD/Fs by the cooling unit were 58% in P1, 
40% in P2, 62% in A1 and 92% in A2, respectively; however, those by filter were 7.7% in P1, 
12% in P2, 6.5% in A1 and 32% in A2 respectively (Table 4). The above results shows the 
removal efficiencies of total-PBDD/Fs by the cooling unit were higher than those by filter. It 
also suggests that only using APCDs including cooling unit, filter and three-stage glass PUF 
cartridge absorption is not sufficient for PBDD/F control, and the additional APCDs, like 
activated carbon injection in front of filter, are needed. Due to the persistence and toxicity of 
PBDD/Fs, a combined regulation for controlling both PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs is of great 
importance for environmental protection. 
 
3.2 PAH emissions from thermal pre-treatment of waste HDS catalyst 
3.2.1 Characterization of the waste HDS catalysts  
Results show that Al is the dominant metal due to its presence as a supporting material of 
the catalysts, and Mo, Ni and V are 1%, 6% and 17%, respectively (Table 5). After heating, 
the contents of the main metal in the treated residues were decreased by 5% to 99% (based on 
mass); however, much higher concentrations of Mo (1%), Ni (5%) and V (15%) in the treated 
residues implied that recovering metals by hydrometallurgy has more economical potential.  
Twelve elements in original waste catalysts and treated residues were examined in TCLP.

secondary combustion temperature, the majority of PAHs are low molecular weight PAHs 
(73% and 75%) and the next is high molecular weight PAHs (26% and 25%) with a total of 
1045 and 1054 ng/m3, and total BaPeq were 41 and 45 ng/g (Table 8). Tsai et al. (2002) [19] 
reported that the thermal process converts higher molecular weight PAHs to lower molecular 
weight PAHs due to their lower boiling point and higher stability, LM-PAHs tend to 
accumulate in the system and are responsible for the dominant compounds, such as Nap 
(2-ring PAH) [15]. With a total of 940 and 1159 ng (at different pyrolysis temperatures 300 ˚C 
and 400 ˚C and 1200 °C secondary combustion temperature), the emitted PAHs are 
approximately 4.5% and 5.5% of those originally present in the catalyst. This indicates that 
the afterburner temperature (1200˚C) involved was high enough to prohibit the generation of 
HM-PAHs, leading to lower concentrations than LM-PAHs [20, 21].  
 
3.3 Recovery of valuable metals via electrolysis process 
3.3.1 Recovery of Cu from the extract of printed circuit boards 
  The extract of printed circuit boards with high concentration of Cu (31490 mg/L) was used 
as electrolyte. Experiments were conducted with increasing the initial electrolyte pH value 
from 3.0 to 4.5 to evaluate the effect of initial electrolyte pH on the recovery of Cu. Current 
was adjusted to 2.0 A and held constant for each run with a retention time of 2 h. Figure 2 
shows the effect of initial pH value on Cu recovery. The electrolytic recovery of Cu at initial 
pH value of 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 was 37.6%, 39.2%, 42.2% and 42.7%, respectively. Results 
show that the maximum recovery of Cu is obtained at the initial pH value of 4.5. Furthermore, 
we found that the electrolytic recovery of Cu at the initial pH value of 4.5 increases 
dramatically with increasing time from 0.5 h to 1.5 h, but increase slightly at 2 h, due to the 
pH value changed in the electrolysis process. Although the electrolytic recovery of Cu (42.7%) 
is poor, it is a feasible technique for Cu recovery from extract of printed circuit boards. 
However, its recovery should be improved by combining with other techniques. From the 
above results, we found that the high concentration of Cu (15900 mg/L) still exist in 
electrolyte after reaction of 2 h. These solutions are suggested to further recovery by 
increasing their pH value to the optimum initial value of 4.5. In addition, another technique 
such as selective ion-exchange will be used to enhance the recovery.  
3.3.2 Recovery of Mo, Ni and V from the leachate of treated catalyst 
  The leachate with high concentrations of Mo (433 mg/L), Ni (2012 mg/L) and V (6168 
mg/L) was used as electrolyte. A series of experiments were conducted with increasing the 
 14
and waste HDS catalysts, and then develop control technologies for toxic air pollutants 
(PBDD/Fs and PAHs) from the recovering process. Based on the results obtained, the 
following conclusions can be drawn.  
(1) The high temperature melting equipment has been set up. This melting system consists of 
a high temperature furnace, a secondary combustion chamber, one set of air pollution control 
devices (APCDs) including cooling unit (collected the condensed water of volatile gas), filter 
(collected particles) and three-stage glass PUF cartridge absorption (collected gaseous phase 
compound). Thus, fates for the pollutants during waste thermal treating process can be seen 
completely. We already took out a patent on this melting system. The patent number of it was 
M264023. 
(2) We found that temperature and the addition of CaO are two significant factors that 
influenced the extent of PBDD/Fs formation from the pyrolysis of P-CBs. Results show that 
the formation of PBDD/Fs during pyrolysis can be destroyed under controlled primary 
combustion conditions. Furthermore, the addition of CaO is effective in adsorbing HBr and 
results in the inhibition of PBDD/Fs synthesis by more than 90%, and further prevents the 
acid gases (HCl and HBr) that corrode the equipment. The above results are shown in article 
entitled “Inhibition of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans formation from 
the pyrolysis of printed circuit boards”, which has been published on Environ. Sci. Technol 
(February, 2007).  
(3) We found that pre-thermal treatment performed before hydrometallurgy did generate PAH 
emissions. Results show that total-PAH content in treated residues decreased with the heating 
temperature of the primary furnace, while those generated in flue gases were destroyed by an 
afterburner at 1200 oC (approximately 90%). The above results are shown in article entitled 
“Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from thermal pre-treatment of waste 
hydrodesulfurization catalysts”, which has been accepted by Chemosphere (April, 2007).  
(4) Electrolysis process is a feasible technique for Cu recovery from the leachant of waste 
P-CBs, and for Mo, Ni and V recovery from leaching solution of treated catalysts. However, 
their recoveries were still poor and should be improved. Therefore, another technique such as 
selective ion-exchange will be used to enhance the recovery.
