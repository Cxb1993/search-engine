DESIGN DIRECTION /
The information architecture of expected design system is studied to defined user’s 
requirement for better transport experiences. The design direction is as shown below.
依據前階段設定之系統範圍、現況分析，配合觀察及訪談結果，提出新的體驗與活，並
訂定設計方針如下：
ANALYSIS /
There are two steps in the research stage. Step 1, function analysis has been conducted to define the 
functions provided by current transportation system and to clarify the range of the system. Step 2, the 
information architecture has been explored to understand to information structure of current system.
此階段分兩步驟進行
首先使用function analysis定義並釐清設計系統的服務範圍
第二階段參考MAYA company之information architechture進行現況分析,以確認系統提供的服務目標
EXPLORATION / Shadowing
The technique of shadowing is applied to understand the users’ daily activities and experience. Three 
female are chosen as subjects. Their movements of a day have been followed, recorded and 
analyzed. The findings from the field works help us to find out the behavior models of commuters.
藉由shadowing的方式實地觀察上班族，實際體驗期上班路程，並找出上班之行為模式與途
中可能遇到的問題，幫助了解使用者想法，以期能站在使用者的立場思考。本研究於此階段
選擇了三位於大台北都會區上班之女性為觀察對象。

SmarP is an intelligent service system.
By the information sharing platform, people can get different information just with a “click”, or touch 
SmarP to select options they want. Passengers can order their food beforehand during rush hours of 
taking transportation to their offices; therefore, they can save time and have the experience of shopping 
without pressure. When they reach their destination, they can get their orders immediately instead of 
waiting in line for a long time. The service of SmarP provides the commuters interesting activities, so that 
sleeping and dazing are not the only choice for commuters.
SmarP是一套聰明的服務系統
透過計畫組織的資訊共享平台，在點選之間 即可完成閱讀各類資訊， 
尤其購物的活動，讓忙碌的現代上班族利用交通的時間空檔進行餐點訂購，
並於出站後取貨 省去在商店焦急的大排長龍。
貼心的SmarP讓上班族在車上不再只是發呆或睡覺。
