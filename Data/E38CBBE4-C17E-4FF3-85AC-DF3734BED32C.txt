Abstract 
Massively parallel maskless lithography 
(MPML2) system has been developed by the 
joint group in National Taiwan University. 
MPML2 is a multiple electron beam direct-
write system which aims at 22 nm node 
semiconductor manufacturing. For 
electrostatic lens design of MPML2, a 
simulator capable of 2D and 3D electrostatic 
lens simulation is implemented. This 
simulator consists three parts: field 
computation, trajectory simulation, and 
optical performance evaluation. Electrostatic 
field of lenses is evaluated via finite element 
method (FEM) with the core of COMSOL 
Multiphysics, while the other two parts are 
developed under MATLAB environment. For 
electron trajectory simulation, ideal and 
practical trajectories can be computed. For 
optical property evaluation, the primary 
geometrical and chromatic aberrations are 
evaluated for rotationally symmetrical lenses. 
Besides the conventional aberration analysis, 
direct ray tracing method for minimum spot 
size is also proposed and implemented. 
Finally, this simulator is applied to e-beam 
direct-write system design and analysis for 
preliminary lens design of MPML2. The Lens 
parameters of MPML2 are determined 
successfully.

3. Trajectory Simulation 
Electron trajectories reveal how the lens 
works, and there are two types of electron 
trajectories. One is the practical trajectory 
which is direct traced directly from the field 
distribution, and it is the real path of electron 
in the EOS. The other is the ideal trajectory, 
or Gaussian trajectory, which is computed 
under paraxial approximation and it, describes 
the perfect optical behavior. Gaussian 
trajectory is important to lens design and 
aberration evaluation.  
3.1 Practical Trajectory Simulation Result 
Since individual beam in MPML2 is 
operated in low current and low energy. 
Interactions between electrons are neglect in 
this simulator. Hence the practical trajectory 
can be described by Lorentz’s equation 
 
0( )
d m v eE
dt
γ = KK  (3)
where  is rest mass of the electron, v0m
K  is the 
velocity  is electron charge, E is electric 
field, and 
e
K
γ  is the Lorentz factor in special 
relativity. To solve Lorentz’s equation 
numerically and precisely, 4th order Runge-
Kutta method is applied [6]. The concept of 
4th order Runge-Kutta method is to evaluate 
the position and velocity of next step with a 
weighted sum of four new data predicted, and 
so that the discrete step error can be well 
controlled. Through the above-mentioned, real 
trajectory result can be obtained and 
simulated. Fig. 3 shows an example of three-
electrode lens, in which the structure and 
simulation settings are listed in Table 1.

 Since above simulation settings and three-

determined, real trajectory is computed by 
direct interpolation method, and the result is 
plotted in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.

quality analysis. Aberrations are the 
mismatches between the real image and the 
idea image estimated from Gaussian trajectory 
equation. They provide not only a standard 
manner to analyze blurring image, but a 
classification of causes of image degradation. 
Aberrations result from not only the 
geometrical design of the optical system, but 
the variation of initial energy of electrons. The 
former is called geometrical aberration, while 
the latter is called chromatic 
aberration [3] [5] [8]. 
The primary causes of image degradation 
are 3rd order geometrical aberrations and 3rd 
order chromatic aberration. 3rd order 
geometrical aberration is derived as

[5] and reference [8]. 
   Aberration analysis is useful in projection 
lithographic or microscopic systems. For 
probe-forming system, the spot size on wafer 
is more important than aberration coefficients. 
Thus direct ray tracing method rises and gains 
more and more interests. This method relies 
on computing a set of rays with different 
initial conditions, and then analyzes the lens 
performance with the collective and statistic 
result of these rays. The more non-ideal 
effects the simulator can estimate, the more 
non-ideal factors are contains in the analysis 
results. Likewise, the more precise the ray 
trajectory is evaluated, the more accurate the 
analysis result obtained. 
Here two methods for minimum spot size 
evaluation are proposed. First, as the green 
lines in Fig. 8  show, the spatial radius 
variation along optical axis is evaluated with 
its envelope of ray trajectories. Intuitively, the 
narrowest part of the envelope near the image 
plane is the

minimum spot requested in probe forming 
systems. This scheme treats each ray with the 
same weighting, so that each kind of initial 
conditions has the same significance to spot 
size. However, this treatment may not be 
consistent with the practice. Since there are 
always energy and current distributions inside 
the electron beam. To approach the reality, 
initial condition of rays should be considered. 
In e-beam lithographic system, since electron 
energy and charge density are two important 
parameters in resist exposure process, current 
distributions should be added into 
considerations during minimum spot size 
determination. 
Special weightings are added to rays so that 
each ray is no longer an electron trajectory but 
a current flow. These weightings should 
follow the current distribution of the source. 
Thus, to apply this weighted simulation, the 
current distribution of the source should be 
known in advance. The red lines in Fig. 8  are
