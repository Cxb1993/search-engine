ENGLISH ABSTRACT 
This study also analyzed airflow using fluid simulation software (Fluent) to examine  simulated flow 
field distribution under various filter intervals (1, 2.3 and 3.6 cm) in an air-conditioning circulation chamber. 
Referring to the simulated experimental data, this work placed electrophoretic deposition (EPD) on 
photocatalytic filters in an enclosed circulative chamber to decompose formaldehyde, allowing photocatalytic 
filters to exert the greatest decomposition effect. The results show that in the testing environment, six 
photocatalytic filters at the interval of 2.3 cm achieved photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) efficiency of 29.7 %, 
higher than the 1 cm interval at 26.4 %. This result reveals that using simulation software for photocatalyst 
filter intervals decreases filter design flaws, reducing initial installation cost, and raising photocatalyst 
utilization efficiency to achieve higher photocatalytic efficiency. 
In the final part of this study, the intelligent nano photocatalyst air cleaner for degrading the ammonia 
gas was developed, to dispel unpleasant odors step systemtically according to the concentration of ammonia. 
The results showed the decomposition efficiency of TiO2 photocatalyst was 41.2 % and the power 
consumption of photocatalyst reactor for degradation of ammonia with intelligent control and normal control 
were 7.016 and 11.45 kWh, respectively. The intelligent control combines the UV lamps and fan and save 
energy about 38.72 % more than the normal control. This method can reduce any cost increase and energy 
consumption caused by various design flaws of reactors.

simulated flow field distribution under different quantities and filter intervals in an air-conditioning 
circulation chamber. 
This paper investigates the effectiveness of TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation of formaldehyde under 
different heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC)-related air conditions. The chamber simulated an indoor 
environment polluted by formaldehyde. Photocatalytic filters were applied to the chamber for analyzing the 
efficiency of photocatalytic filters in decomposing formaldehyde. Formaldehyde, at a specific concentration, 
was injected into an enclosed HVAC test chamber and circulated under UV irradiation though a TiO2 nanofilm 
coated stainless steel air filter. After two hours of HVAC operation under a preset temperature, relative 
humidity (RH), and air velocity conditions. 
Finally, this study used an intelligent nano-photocatalyst reactor to dispel unpleasant odors systematically 
according to the concentration of ammonia. This method can decrease any cost increase and energy 
consumption caused by different design flaws of a reactor.

2.1.2The Influence of Interval and Illumination 
The absorption rate per unit area occupied by two filters is far higher than 6 filters. This is because the 
closer the filter interval the stronger the shadow effect will be. Thus, when more filters are used, the increase 
in interval will not equate to the increase efficiency of filters. In the case of the filter UV illumination rate as 
shown in Table 1.2, because the photocatalyst needs the rays and effects of the UV light to ensure that the 
electrons absorb sufficient energy, the area that is vacated by the electrons would form electric holes that carry 
positive electricity. The electric holes will cause the oxidation (and thus obtain the electrons) of the OH- of 
nearby water molecules, thus causing them to be highly active OH radicals. The increase of the unit area of 
filters intervals (3.6 cm) achieved an efficiency rate as high as 72 %, showing an increase in intervals. As 
shown in Table 2.1, when the intervals remain unchanged, the efficiency rate is also reduced. The use of filter 
intervals is due to the fact that the photocatalyst air cleaners currently being sold in the market are designed 
based on the density of filters, thus this study provides factories and researchers a reference for future research 
and design.

processing, preparing the ammonia solution concentration 0.5 wt. %, injecting the specific stable 
concentration was about 17 ppm ammonia gas from the recycle pump and test the influence of various 
operational parameters on the efficacy of ammonia decomposition by photocatalyst with UV

power ) for 60 min.

CHAPTER 3  
CONCLUSIONS 
 
1. To confirm that photocatalytic TiO2 coated air filters are capable of controlling formaldehyde 
contaminations by UV illuminated in the above case. When the circulating air temperature is raised, the 
adsorption decline effectiveness also increases. In addition, when the velocity of the circulating air 
increased, the adsorption of the system increased, reaching saturation. Overall, formaldehyde removal 
efficiency of the UV illuminated TiO2 photocatalytic filter increased with increases in temperature, relative 
humidity, and air velocity, the TiO2 photocatalytic degradation rates reached 33-42 %. The results show 
that photocatalytic stainless steel filters can decrease indoor formaldehyde concentrations.  
2. The intelligent nano-photocatalyst cleaner developed by this study can adjust the calculation of parameters 
according to the concentration of ammonia, the decomposition efficiency of TiO2 photocatalyst was 41.2 
%. Applying this experimental idea to dispel unpleasant toilet odors can not only make photocatalyst reach 
the highest efficiency, but can also achieve the objectives of cost reduction and energy conservation reach 
about 38.72 % than the normal control..
