Abstract 
Electrochemical planarization (ECP) technique, because of its stress-free, high 
removal rate, low waste stream, abrasive-free and scratching-free characteristics, can 
resolve the problems of surface defects, contamination, post-cleaning difficulty and 
lower throughput. Thus, the ECP method is expected to use in copper interconnection 
process with fragile low-κ dielectrics instead of chemical mechanical planarization 
(CMP). In this study, we analyzed the planarization mechanism of copper-plated 
wafer in H3PO4 with various concentrations. Furthermore, we also investigated the 
effect of the alcoholic additives in electrolytes.

Results and Discussion 
 
The performance of ECP is generally controlled in mass-transfer limited 
condition, i.e. the limiting current density plateau of current-voltage relationship [2]. 
Figure 1 (a) shows the limiting current densities of copper changed with various 
H3PO4 concentrations. When H3PO4 concentration was below 4 M, the limiting 
current densities increased with the concentration. This result indicated that the H3PO4 
is the mass-transfer limited species at low H3PO4 concentration. However, when 
H3PO4 concentration was above 4 M, the ECP rate decreased with increasing H3PO4 
due to the increased viscosity of solution, and meanwhile the diffusion coefficient of 
limited species also decreased. The effect of H2O concentration in H3PO4 electrolytes 
on limiting current density of copper was described in Fig. 1 (b). It can be found that 
H2O becomes the mass-transfer limited species at high H3PO4 concentration.  
In order to analyze the effect of water content in high-concentration H3PO4 
solution, we added various organic solvents, including ethanol, ethylene glycol and 
glycerol, into 65 w% H3PO4. Fig. 2 shows their results of copper polarization curves. 
It shows that the limiting current densities of copper are close under the equal water 
content. This proves the water is the mass-transfer limited species. However, when the 
applied voltage is larger than 2 V, it is clear that oxygen evolution was inhibited by the 
increased viscosity of the solution due to OH-groups of the additives, and current 
densities decreased. Therefore, copper in 65 w% M H3PO4 with glycerol had the 
lowest current density at the applied-voltage > 2 V. Our experimental results also 
show that the current density is lower when the water content is lower. Moreover, the 
oxygen evolution would occur difficultly due to the lack of water. Thus, the lack of 
water could prevent the destruction of viscous layer by oxygen bubble, and enhance 
the extent of planarization. 
The EIS results of Cu in H3PO4 with various concentrations were presented by 
Nyquist and Bode plots as shown in Fig. 3. From this figure, the loop semicircle 
response of Nyquist plot could be found for Cu electropolishing in phosphoric acid 
electrolytes with the applied at limiting-current density plateau. According to AC 
impedance theory, it was found the characteristics of mass transfer appears clearly in 
H3PO4 electrolytes, and the effect increased with the concentrations due to the viscous 
layer. The diffusion resist due to viscous layer increased, and the charge transfer 
resistance increased. Therefore, the loop size in low-concentration H3PO4 is smaller 
than that in high-concentration H3PO4 as shown in Fig. 3.
