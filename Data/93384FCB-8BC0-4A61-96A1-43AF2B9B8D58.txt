fragments (25-mers) synthesized in situ on a silicon support using photolithography. 
The available SNP chip technology is concentrated around the Affymetrix GeneChip 
Human Mapping Array Set and the Illumina HumanHap Genotyping BeadChip 
efforts. Since in the case of CNVs, the signal intensity of SNP will be either 
increased or decreased, SNP chips can be also applied for the detection of copy 
number variations (CNVs) [Lai and Zhao, 2005; Redon et al., 2006]. 
A number of statistical methods have been developed to address in CNV analysis, 
including detection of CNVs, estimating CNVs, delineating CNV regions or 
CNV/trait association. Most of CNV analysis largely coincide with methods for the 
analysis of expression data, including analysis of variance, limma, and GC-RMA 
models [Wolfinger et al., 2001; Wettenhall and Smyth, 2004], or two-channel array 
data analysis. This follows from the direct comparison of test and reference sample in 
establishing whole genome copy number maps as the basis of analysis [Olshen et al., 
2004]. They proposed a circular binary segmentation (CBS) method that detects 
aberrations by recursively using a likelihood ratio test statistics to look for two 
breakpoints at a time by considering the segment as a circle. Jong et al. [2003] used a 
genetic local search algorithm to examine the CGH profile by maximizing likelihood 
with a penalty term containing the number of breakpoints along the chromosome. 
Fridlyand et al. [2004] used an unsupervised hidden Markov model (HMM) approach 
which intends to model the possible dependence of a clone with its near neighbors to 
classify each chromosome into different states representing different copy numbers. 
Huang et al. [2004] described an algorithm using whole genome sampling analysis 
(WGSA) to identify genome-wide chromosomal gains and losses. Wang et al. [2005] 
proposed a hierarchical clustering algorithm, named ‘cluster along chromosomes’ 
(CLAC) to build hierarchical clustering-style trees along the chromosome and select 
interesting cluster to by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) [Benjamini and 
Hochberg, 1995; Storey, 2002]. Hsu et al. [2005] used a wavelets approach to 
de-noise the data to uncover the true copy number alterations. Lai and Zhao [2005] 
used the t-test to detect copy number changes by aggregating information from 
replicated arrays. Price et al. [2005] applied the Smith-Waterman dynamic 
programming (SW-ARRAY) to search for breakpoints. Picard et al. [2005] further 
combined dynamic programming with penalized likelihood to identify breakpoints. 
Huang et al. [2005] incorporated the spatial dependence of DNA copy number data 
into a regression model and formalize the detection of copy number alterations based 
on the penalized least squares regression. Komura et al. [2006] described an algorithm 
via an improved Genomic Imbalance Map (GIM) algorithm [Ishikawa et al., 2005], an 
adapted SW-ARRAY procedure [Price et al., 2005] and a graph-theory based 
extraction of reference CNV results to detect CNV regions. Huang et al. [2006] used

2.1 DNA copy number alteration 
The goal of the analysis of DNA copy number data is to partition the whole genome 
into segments where copy numbers change between contiguous segments, and 
subsequently to quantify the copy number in each segment. Therefore, identifying the 
exact locations of copy number changes is fundamentally important to the analysis of 
DNA copy number data. In this project, we base on Huang et al. [2005] approach and 
propose another aspect to assess the spatial dependence in DNA copy number 
alterations. We construct DNA copy number alterations based on the penalized least 
squares method. An array CGH profile is denoted as follows. Let an array-based CGH 
profile denote Xi as the log2 ratio of the normalized intensities of the red over green 
channels of marker i on a chromosome where the read green channels measure the 
intensities of the cancer and normal samples. We further assume that the observed Xi 
is a realization of the true relative copy number βi at marker i plus a random noise εi , 
Xi = βi + εi ,  i = 1, … , n 
where n is the number of markers on a given chromosome. Note that the copy number 
data are ordered by the locations of the markers and have spatial dependence due to 
the physical dependence of nearby markers. In fact, the spatial dependence of the 
copy number data is exhibited in both signals βi and noise εi. The signals βi have 
spatial dependence because the true copy numbers of the nearby markers are the same 
except in the regions where the copy number change abruptly. 
 
2.2 Stochastic differential equation 
The signals βi have spatial dependence due to the physical dependence of nearby 
markers. Intuitively, the absolute distance of nearby markers might provide a 
measurement of the parameter βi, which stands for the spatial dependence of the 
signals. We estimate βi by a general form of SDE as follows: 
dβi = f(Xj)dl + g(Xj)dWi(l), 
where i, j are position parameters, l denotes the length along the chromosome, and 
W(l) = [W1(l), W2(l), …, Wn(l)] is an n-dimensional standard Brownian motion 
representing the source of uncertainty of stochastic noises or random errors. To model 
the stochastic dynamics of the spatial dependence, we consider X1, X2, … , Xn as n 
dependent components and another Xn+1, Xn+2, ... , Xn+m as m independent factors that 
might affect experiments. From position i to i+1, the stochastic dynamics of the 
spatial dependence is modeled by 
∆Xi / Xi = [Xj+1-Xi] / Xi

3. Results and Discussion 
To evaluate our approach, we applied our method in the analysis of lymphoma 
data consisting of 50 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), 40 cases of 
follicular lymphomas (FLs), 37 cases of mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), and 87 cases 
of mucosa-associated tissue (MALT) lymphomas in the Human Mapping 250K NspI 
array set (Kato et al., 2009). All 214 samples were analyzed by our method in 
comparison with the HapMap normal control samples. For simple demonstration, we 
only show the results of chromosome 1 containing three affected genes, PEX14, 
NEGR1, and MAN1A2. 
All 214 samples were fitted with five SDE models respectively as show in Fig 1. 
Most of samples (190 cases) were well fitted as copy number retention (CNR). 
Twenty-four samples were copy number alteration (CNA), where one of them was 
fitted in a deletion model and the other 23 were in 3 amplification models. Further, 
three samples contained very long amplification in the left-hand end, 8 contained 
short amplification in the right-hand side, and 12 contained long amplification also in 
the right-hand side.

4. Conclusion 
The method proposed in this work is able to characterize the copy number 
alterations (CNAs) associated with diseases. The simplified results show that the 
stochastic differential equation is suitable to model the spatial dependence in DNA 
copy number alterations. Combined with linear regressions as statistical approach and 
AIC as selection procedure, our SDE model facilitates the analysis of DNA copy 
number alteration involved in the development of cancer diseases, such as lymphomas
