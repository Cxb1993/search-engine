I. Abstract 
 
This project was focused on the study of the 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of a metallic 
nanostructure with multi coreshelled nanoscatterers.  
A set of surface integral equations will be derived, 
and a boundary-element method (BEM) code was 
developed to solve these equations for a 2D TM 
mode problems.  In this report, nanostructures of 
coreshelled monomer and dimer are analyzed to 
demonstrate our method for the simulation of 
coupled SPR. In addition, the characteristic equation

For simplicity, a process of fluorescence is divided 
into two stages; the first is the excitation stage and the 
model of an incident p-polarized plane wave 
irradiating the nanostructure is simulated to 
investigate the enhancement of the local electric field 
at the location of the emitter for its excitation. 
Throughout the paper, only a two-dimensional (2D) 
transverse-magnetic (TM) model is considered.  At 
the excitation stage, local-field factor K is used to 
show the enhancement of the emitter’s excitation; for 
one-photon excitation, the emitter’s excitation 
increases by a factor K2, and for two-photon excitation 
by K4[6, 8].  For the emission stage, an electric 
dipole interacting with an Au-nanoantenna, is used to 
simulate the emission of the excited emitter within the 
feed gap. At this stage, a quantum yield η [10, 12] of 
the dipole under the influence of a bowtie 
nanoantenna is defined as the ratio of the radiative 
power to the total power

where the denominator is the total power of the sum 
of the radiative power and the nonradiative power. 
Here the radiative power is the energy flow rate 
emitting to the far field, and the nonradiative power is 
the dissipation rate.  Since the radiative power is the 
energy flow rate to the far field, the average radiative 
power can be expressed by half the surface integral of 
the normal Poynting vector along an arbitrary 
simple-connected and closed surface Sar enclosing the 
nanoantenna and the dipole,

boundary of the nanoantenna is taken as the normal 
component of the Poynting vector along the Sar, as 
expressed by zt
HE
.  If the host is a lossless material, 
the dissipation only occurs in the metallic structure.  
Hence, the average nonradiative power of cycle equals 
the net energy flow rate into the metallic nanoantenna, 
which is half the real part of the integral of the normal 
Poynting vector along the boundary of metal,

To solve these sur
merical code of boundary-element method (BEM) 
was developed. In the pre-process, the 
multi-connected boundary S1=S12∪S13…∪S1m is 
discretized and reconstructed by isoparameter, 
quadratic elements.  Each element contains three 
nodes whose physical values are regarded as 
unknowns of BEM, and three quadratic shape 
functions are used for the interpolation of the 
physical values at any point within the element in 
terms of that of the three nodes.  When the 
boundary is divided into n nodes, 3n linear algebraic second is the emission stage.  For the former, a 
red-shifted from that of an Au-dimer, and the quantum 
yield of an Au/SiO2 coreshelled dimer behaves like a 
low-pass, the same with Au-dimer, but with a sharper 
profile at the cut-off frequency, 1.95eV.

To illustrate the effect of t
e arms of a linear nanoantenna (as shown in Fig. 5), 
the local-field factor K and quantum yield η versus 
frequency are calculated respectively for different 
aspect ratios (b/a=1, 2, 3, and 4) with a=20 nm and 
gap d=5 nm, as shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b).  A 
special case of b/a=1 is called a dimer.  The results 
of η show that an Au-nanoantenna behaves as a 
low-pass filter for a dipole’s emission, and that the 
cutoff frequency is about 2.2eV.  This is to say, a 
metallic nanoantenna allows most of the 
low-frequency photons emitted from the dipole to 
radiate to the far field, but dissipates most of the 
high-frequency ones as Joule heat inside the metallic 
nanostructure. Therefore, the emission spectrum of the 
radiative part is mainly composed of the 
low-frequency signal, while most of the 
high-frequency photons become the nonradiative part. 
The corresponding cutoff frequency of a linear 
nanoantenna is close to the SPR frequency of a single 
nanorod. The 2D numerical results of the quantum 
yield of a linear nanoantenna show that a metallic 
nanoantenna behaves as a low-pass filter to allow the 
emission of low-frequency photons, but dissipate the 
high-frequency ones.  The cutoff frequency of the 
nanoantenna is very close to the SPR frequency of a 
single nanorod.  In addition, a metallic nanoantenna 
provides a stronger local electric-field enhancement 
for the excitation of an emitter located within the gap, 
and allows a more efficient emission of the excited 
emitter than a single metallic nanorod does.  
Generally, the smaller the gap, the larger the 
local-field factor K but the less the quantum yield η.  
The advantage of a metallic nanoantenna is that even 
though the gap is very small (e.g., 2nm), the quantum 
yield is still high enough for the emission of the 
low-frequency photons.  Moreover, the nanoantenna 
structure can tolerate the asymmetric configuration of 
the arms in length.  In fact, the enhancement of the 
emitter’s emission by a metallic nanoantenna depends 
not only on K and η of the nanostucture, but also on 
the absorption and emission spectra of the emitter. 
Generally, the emission spectrum of an emitter (e.g., 
molecule) is red-shifted from its absorption spectrum, 
due to the Stokes shift.  An optimum method for 
enhancing the emission is to let the absorption 
spectrum of the emitter overlap with the peak region 
of K, and to ensure its emission spectrum is located 
within the low-pass region of η; vice versa and a 
quenching instead of enhancement could occurs for 
the emitter’s spontaneous emission.  To summarize, 
the local-field factor and quantum yield of a metallic 
nanoantenna are superior to that of a single nanorod 
and of a dimer (b/a=1).

2.5 Surface Plasmon Waves along Convex and 
Concave Metal-dielectric Interface [7] 
In this year, the characteristic equation of the 
dispersion relation of a surface plasmon wave (SPW) 
creeping along a convex or a concave metal-dielectric 
interface was also derived.  We assume there exists a 
SPW propagating along the circumference of the 
circular cylinder of radius a.  Physically, the meaning 
of p/a is the wavenumber of SPW propagating along 
the circumference of a circular cylinder with radius a, 
and aθ is the distance of propagation [].  In order to 
compare the phase velocity and the attenuation 
constant of SPWs along a curved interface with that of 
a plane one, two parameters, α and β are defined as 
 
IV. Experimental Works 
 
In this year, we developed a new technique of using 
laser-scanning confocal microscopy to obtain a 
complex image of the combination of the scattering of 
Au nanoparticles or nanorods with the fluorescence of 
dye-molecules. Two cell are used for our experiments; 
one is a normal breast cell (H184), and the other a 
breast cancer cell (435s). Fig. 10 shows the TEM 
photos of a H184 cell which takes up some Au 
nanoparticles, and the Fig. 11 shows the image of 
confocal microscopy with 561nm-laser [8]. 
)Re(/)/Re( spkap=α , )Im(/)/Im( spkap=β  
, where α is the ratio of the phase velocity of SPW 
along a plane interface to that of SPW along a curved 
one, and β is the ratio of the attenuation constant of 
SPW along a curved interface to that of SPW along a 
plane one at a same frequency.  The results indicate 
that the phase velocity of SPW propagating along a 
convex interface is always less than that along a plane 
one, and will approach the value of the plane one as 
the radius of curvature of the convex interface, the 
permittivity of the dielectric host, or the frequency 
increases. In contrast, the phase velocity of SPW 
propagating along a concave interface is always faster 
than that along a plane one, and will close to the plane 
one as the radius of curvature of the concave interface, 
the permittivity of the dielectric cylinder, or the 
frequency increases. In addition, the attenuation 
constant of the SPWs of the convex and concave cases 
is always larger than that of a plane one, due to the 
radial radiation of the electromagnetic energy into the 
host except the dissipation in the metal.

發表論文題目 The quantum yield of a metallic nanostructure of dimer 
著者 Jiunn-Woei Liaw 
Abstract 
In this paper, a nanostructure of a metallic dimer is studied, which consists two 
nearby metallic nanoparticles, to find the possibility for the enhancement of a single 
molecule’s fluorescence by this nanostructure. A simple model, an oscillating dipole 
within the gap of a metallic dimer, is used to simulate an excited molecule 
interacting with the dimer in the frequency range of UV to NIR. With the aid of a 
set of new surface integral equations, the electromagnetic fields in the proximity of 
the dimer are solved by the boundary-element method (BEM). The quantum yield, 
the ratio of the radiative power to the total power generated from the dipole, is used 
to evaluate the efficiency of the dipole’s emission. The results of BEM show that 
the quantum yield of a metallic dimer is better than a single nanoparticle, even 
though the gap is very small. In addition, a metallic dimer behaves like a low-pass 
filter which allows most of the dipole’s energy of the long-wavelength part radiate 
to the far field. In contrast, for the short-wavelength part, the nonradiative part is 
dominant; i.e. most of the dipole’s energy is dissipated into Joule’s heat inside the 
metallic dimer in high-frequency range. Two noble metals, Au and Ag, are used for 
the dimer, and both of them exhibit the same tendencies.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, a nanostructure of a metallic dimer is studied, which consists two 
nearby metallic nanoparticles, to find the possibility for the enhancement of a single 
molecule’s fluorescence by this nanostructure. A simple model, an oscillating dipole 
within the gap of a metallic dimer, is used to simulate an excited molecule interacting 
with the dimer in the frequency range of UV to NIR. With the aid of a set of new 
surface integral equations, the electromagnetic fields in the proximity of the dimer are 
solved by the boundary-element method (BEM). The quantum yield, the ratio of the 
radiative power to the total power generated from the dipole, is used to evaluate the 
efficiency of the dipole’s emission. The results of BEM show that the quantum yield 
of a metallic dimer is better than a single nanoparticle, even though the gap is very 
small. In addition, a metallic dimer behaves like a low-pass filter which allows most 
of the dipole’s energy of the long-wavelength part radiate to the far field. In contrast, 
for the short-wavelength part, the nonradiative part is dominant; i.e. most of the 
dipole’s energy is dissipated into Joule’s heat inside the metallic dimer in 
high-frequency range. Two noble metals, Au and Ag, are used for the dimer, and both 
of them exhibit the same tendencies.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
Using a nanostructure (e.g. nanophotonics, or nanocavity) to enhance the 
fluorescence of a single molecule attracts considerable attention recently. In particular, 
several metallic nanostructures, e.g. metallic colloid [1], nanoprobe [2], dimer and 
nanoantenna [3], were proposed.  The original idea is to utilize the surface plasmon

where the Green functions Gj are the singular solutions of Helmholtz 
equations of medium j, j=1, 2, 3. The permittivity εj and the permeability μj of 
medium 2 and 3 are the same. These equations in terms of the surface 
components of the tangential magnetic field Hz, the normal displacement field 
Dn and the tangential electric field Et can be solved systematically along the 
multi-connected interfaces of the two scatterers and the host by using the 
boundary-element method (BEM). Eqs. (1) to (3) belong to Fredholm 
equations of the second kind, so that their numerical stabilities are well.  
 
3. Local field factor &quantum yield [5,6] 
 
The definition of the local field factor is the ratio of the amplitude of the local 
electric field at the location of the molecule to the incident plane wave. The quantum 
yield η of the whole system is defined as the ratio of the radiative power to the total 
power generated from the dipole,

Since the metallic nanostructure is a dissipative system, the other energy will be 
absorbed by the metal and be converted into heat, which is the so-called nonradiative 
part. The local field factor, a function of frequency, can be regarded as the transfer 
function for the nanostructure to excite a molecule, while the quantum yield can be
