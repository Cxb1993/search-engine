Abstract 
The representative anisotropic parameters for an aquifer located at the campus of the National Yunlin 
University of Science and Technology in Taiwan have been acquired. A constant-rate pumping test was 
carried out, and drawdown-time data were collected from ten observation wells. Applications of the 
conventional aquifer test analysis, which assumes aquifer homogeneity for each observed well hydrograph, 
yielded spatially varying transmissivity and storage coefficient estimates, contradicting the homogeneous 
assumption. A direct approach and a nonlinear-least squares minimization of distance-drawdown data were 
then employed to analyze anisotropy of the transmissivity of an equivalent homogeneous aquifer. Results 
show that the direction and values of anisotropic transmissivities vary with time and the estimates depend on 
the number of observation wells used. These field results are consistent with results from recent theoretical 
investigations which questioned the suitability of the conventional aquifer test analysis.

1 Introduction 
Several methods are available for determining horizontal aquifer anisotropy using drawdown time and 
several of these have specific requirements for the minimum number of observation wells and their alignment 
relative to the pumping well (Batu 1998). The Hantush and Thomas (1966) method, for example, requires 
observation wells to be placed along at least three different radial directions from the pumping well to 
determine the aquifer storage coefficient and the principal orientation and magnitude of the areal anisotropy of 
transmissivity. The Papadopoulos (1965) method, used for determining the transmissivity tensor of a 
homogeneous and anisotropic aquifer, requires three or more observation wells along different directions from 
the pumping well. This method is based on the assumption of an infinite areal extent of the aquifer and a 
constant-rate aquifer pumping test. Way and McKee (1982) proposed a method which could be used to 
investigate three-dimensional permeability in homogeneous, anisotropic, leaky formations. However, they did 
not present a procedure for determining three-dimensional permeability from field aquifer-test data. Neuman

of a heterogeneous aquifer was illustrated. 
2 Field site description 
The aquifer test with multiple observation wells was conducted at an experimental field site on the campus 
of the National Yunlin University of Science and Technology (NYUST), located in the western central part of 
Taiwan. There were eleven wells at the site and each observation well was drilled 20 m deep from the ground 
surface. A Schedule 40 PVC pipe of 4.00-inch (10.2-cm) diameter was used for the well screen and casing, and 
the borehole was screened with a 0.02-inch (0.1-cm) slotted screen.  The screen length was 18.50 m and was 
placed 1.50 m below the ground surface and extended down to the 20.00 m depth. A layout of the pumping and 
observation wells is shown in Fig. 1, with the pumping well denoted by BH04. Table 1 lists the coordinates of 
the pumping well and observation wells. The radial distance of each observation well from the pumping well is 
also presented in Table 1. During the pumping test, a constant flow rate of 1.78 × 10-4 cubic meter per second 
was maintained for four days at the pumping well. The remaining ten wells were used as observation wells to 
monitor the drawdowns. 
Data taken from the logs of the drilled wells and the grain size analysis of five wells show that the 
aquifer is stratified with several geological layers: the depth 0.00 - 1.10 m is refilled soil of clay, sand, gravel 
and rocks; 1.10 - 3.40 m is silt-clay; 3.40 - 6.35 m is fine sand with fine gravel; 6.35 - 7.40 m is silt-clay with 
organics; 7.40 - 10.70 m is fine sand with clay; 10.70 - 14.60 m is silt-clay; 14.60 - 20.00 m is silt-sand with 
clay; and clay when the depth is greater than 20.00 m. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show geological cross-sections 
A-A' and B-B', respectively (refer to Fig 1 for well locations). As indicated in the figures, the aquifer is mainly 
comprised of four materials, namely gravel, loam, sand, and silt and clay. There are many parallel 
stratification layers; the groundwater moves along the sand layer (Figs. 2(b) and 3(b)).  
3 Methods of analysis 
3.1 Analytical solution 
The well hydrographs (drawdown-time data) of the ten observation wells were analyzed by several 
methods that employ an analytical solution described below.  The distribution of drawdown around a fully 
penetrating pumping well in a homogeneous, confined anisotropic aquifer at a constant pumping rate is 
assumed to be governed by

where s is drawdown; Txx ,Tyy and Txy are the components of the transmissivities; S is storage coefficient; Q is 
discharge rate; x, y are coordinates of an arbitrary set of axes with the well at the origin.  
A method to Eq. (1) was given by Papadopoulos (1965) which describes drawdown in observation wells 
in a confined, homogeneous and anisotropic aquifer extending infinitely in lateral directions. This method for 
determination of horizontal aquifer anisotropy requires four wells, one for water withdrawal and three for 
drawdown observations. Neuman et al. (1984) extended the method to situations where the total number of 
wells is as few as three based on a minimum of two pumping tests. After a rotation of the coordinate system to 
align the coordinate axes along the principal directions of the transmissivity, Eq. (1) takes the form 
5 
3.2.1 Equivalent homogeneous S and isotropic T 
To estimate T  and S in the first scenario, a nonlinear least-squares approach was applied to minimize 
the following objective function: 
 2( , ) *( , ) minimali i
i
s r t s r t                             (8) 
where ( , )is r t  and 
*( , )is r t  are the theoretical drawdown in an equivalent homogeneous aquifer predicted 
by the Theis solution (Eq. (5)) and the observed drawdown at an observation well at a distance r  from the 
pumping well in an aquifer at a given time it , respectively.  The objective function is calculated by 
including data at each sampling time interval, i, over a selected time period (e.g., early time, late time, or 
ensemble time (i.e., early and late times combined)) of the observed well hydrograph at a selected observation 
well. 
3.2.2 Equivalent homogeneous S and anisotropic T 
For scenario 2, two methods, namely direct and distance-drawdown, based on Eq. (6) were employed to 
determine the S and anisotropic T. They are discussed below. 
1. Direct approach   
One way to estimate the anisotropic transmissivity values, Txx, Tyy, Txy, and storage coefficient S is the 
approach by Papadopoulos (1965) and Neuman et al. (1984).  It uses hydrographs from three observed wells 
to establish three equations with three unknowns, and then the system of equations is solved directly. In order 
to obtain a physically correct solution, the system of equations must meet a positive definite requirement. 
2. Distance-drawdown approach   
In this approach, a nonlinear least-squares procedure is used to seek the optimal Txx, Tyy, and Txy and S 
which minimizes the following objective function: 
 2( , ) * ( , )i i
i
s r t s r t                                       (9) 
where ),( trs i  and ),(
* trs i  are the theoretical drawdown predicted by Eq. (6) which assumes an equivalent 
homogeneous and anisotropic aquifer and the observed drawdown at an observation well at a distance ir  
from the pumping well in an aquifer at a given time t, respectively. The objective function includes 
drawdowns at all observation wells at a given time. Wu et al. (2005) used this method to analyze well 
hydrographs generated in synthetic heterogeneous aquifers. They argued and demonstrated that this approach 
can yield theoretically consistent effective parameter values for equivalent homogeneous aquifers if a large 
number of observation wells are used.   
In this study, the Gauss-Newton algorithm was employed to search the solution of the nonlinear 
least-squares minimization function (Eq. 9). In order to apply the Gauss-Newton algorithm, the derivatives of 
Eq. (6) with respect to Txx, Tyy, Txy, and S (i.e., sensitivity of drawdown to changes in parameters) were 
7 
4 RESULTS  
4.1 Analysis of well hydrographs of individual observation wells  
Figure 4 illustrates the contours of measured drawdowns at the ten observation wells after four days of 
pumping for a constant flow-rate test in the aquifer. These contours show irregular drawdown distribution, 
indicating the effect of heterogeneity and the general behavior of an equivalent homogeneous aquifer with a 
transmissivity anisotropy (i.e., the drawdown distribution is elongated in y direction, suggesting that Tyy is 
greater than Txx).   
 The drawdown-time curve at individual observation wells shows that the observed drawdown time data 
agree with the theoretical Theis solution (solid lines) at early time (i.e. t < 1 × 104 sec) and there exists a large 
discrepancy between the Theis solution and observed drawdown data for t > 1 × 104 sec (Fig. 5). At this late 
time period, most observed drawdowns are much less than those calculated by the Theis solution, indicative 
of possible effects of recharge boundary, leakage, thickness, or source of water from the unsaturated zone.   
In spite of these deviations from the ideal behavior of Theis’ aquifers at late time, the conventional 
analysis of an aquifer test (Eq. 5) assuming aquifer homogeneity and isotropy was applied to the hydrograph 
of each observation well to estimate T and S (i.e., Te and Se). A comparison of the estimated parameters is 
presented in Table 2 using different observation times, i.e., a) the early time of the drawdown data sets, b) the 
late time of the drawdown data sets, and c) the ensemble time of the drawdown data sets. Comparing with the 
estimates based on the early time data, transmissivity, on average, was overestimated by 131% when using the 
late time observation data and by 17% when using the ensemble time observation data. On the other hand, the 
estimated storage coefficient based on the late time data is 81% smaller on average and the estimate using the 
ensemble data is 10% smaller. For this study, the early time data were selected to estimate the parameters. 
 Table 2 also shows that the ten estimated T and S values vary with the observation well. Therefore, they 
are inconsistent with the homogeneous assumption embedded in the Theis solution. These spatially varying T 
and S values are plotted and contoured in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. Wu et al. (2005) attributed this 
variability to the fact that application of the Theis analysis to the pumping test in heterogeneous aquifers 
yields a T estimate that represents an ambiguous average of heterogeneity within the cone of depression. This 
average is heavily influenced by local geology near the pumping well and each individual observation well. 
On the other hand, each S estimate is mainly controlled by the geology between the pumping well and the 
observation wells. The small value of the coefficient of variation in the transmissivity estimates (Table 2) and 
its smooth contours in Fig. 6 support their findings as does the fact that the contours of the transmissivity 
estimates appear to be smoother than the contours of the S estimates (Fig. 7). Table 2 also indicates that the 
coefficient of variation of S is about ten times that of T.   
4.2 Estimation of anisotropy using the direct approach  
Next, the direct approach was applied to estimate the anisotropic transmissivities Txx, Tyy, and Txy,  
respectively, using the early time hydrographs from different sets of combinations of three observation wells. 
Each set is composed of one pumping well with three observation wells. The different sets are characterized 
by the average radial distance between the observation wells and the pumping well. The average radial 
distance is the distance that averages over the three radial distances of the observation wells of each set. The 
9 
of observation wells and a sufficiently long aquifer test should be undertaken. A distance-drawdown analysis 
would be the most appropriate method as suggested by Wu et al. (2005).   
Finally, many have claimed that application of the conventional analysis, which assumes aquifer 
homogeneity, to aquifer tests with one pumping well and one observation well yields a spatially averaged 
transmissivity although cautious interpretation has been emphasized (e.g., Butler 1990; Oliver 1993). The 
results of this study and those by Wu et al. (2005) and Straface et al. (2007) nonetheless demonstrate that the 
analysis results in an evolving transmissivity estimate, which is time dependent as the cone of depression 
grows. While the estimate represents some type of average of spatially varying local transmissivity within the 
cone of depression, it is influenced by transmissivities near the pumping and observation wells. On the other 
hand, the storage coefficient reflects some averaged storage properties between the pumping well and the 
observation wells. Similar results have been reported by Schad and Teutsch (1994), Meier et al. (1998), Leven 
and Dietrich (2006) and by Illman et al. (2007) and Liu et al. (2007) using well-controlled sand box 
experiments.   
Likewise, it has been taught that an aquifer is leaky or unconfined (e.g., Hantush 1956) based on the 
resemblance between one single hydrograph and the solution of the leaky aquifer equation or delayed 
drainage model (e.g., Boulton 1954; Neuman 1972; Moench 1997) that assumes homogeneity. In fact, aquifer 
heterogeneity and many other factors may yield similar behaviors. These inconsistent, although practical, 
applications of simplified theories to complex real-world geologic media may have profoundly impacted 
groundwater resource investigations.   
5 Summary and conclusions 
The analysis of a pumping test at a ten-observation well site on the campus of NYUST showed that 
application of the Theis solution to the aquifer test that is based on a well hydrograph from an observation 
well does not yield unique averaged T and S values. In other words, based on an individual well-hydrograph, 
the equivalent isotropic, homogeneous parameters are not possible to be obtained. This result confirms the 
finding by Wu et al. (2005) that the traditional analysis results in an evolving transmissivity estimate, which is 
time dependent as the cone of depression grows. While the estimate represents some type of average of 
spatially varying local transmissivity within the cone of depression, it is influenced by transmissivities near 
the pumping and observation wells. On the other hand, the storage coefficient reflects some averaged storage 
properties between the pumping well and the observation wells.    
 Additionally found was that the traditional three-observation well approach for estimating transmissivity 
anisotropy yielded anisotropic transmissivity values that vary randomly with the radial distance when 120 
combinations were made of the observation wells. A large number of estimated transmissivity values were 
negative, indicative of physically incorrect values. This is attributed to inconsistency between theoretical and 
observed drawdowns due to noise and heterogeneity as well as inflexibility of the direct approach.   
 Alternative to the direct approach, an optimization approach using drawdown data from ten observation 
wells simultaneously was applied to obtain a theoretically consistent anisotropic transmissivity. The results 
show that the anisotropy also evolves with time and the extent of the cone of depression. In addition, the 
estimates of Txx and Tyy from a subset of the ten observed hydrographs can be entirely different from those 
derived from the entire set of ten hydrographs. These results support the conjecture by Wu et al. (2005) that

Abstract 
 
Yuan-Chang and Tuku Townships, the center of the land subsidence area of 
Yunlin County in Taiwan, belong to the Shin-Hu-Wei Creek Drainage System. Highly 
potential occurrences of floods exist in these areas because of difficult drainage due 
to the aforementioned reason. To mitigate the inundation problem and protect the 
resident’s life and property, this study develops an appropriate comprehensive flood 
control solution to reduce flood disasters by considering ecological conservation and 
the environmental landscape. The major inundation areas were evaluated according 
to a topographical survey, hydrological analysis, and hydraulic modeling. A 
two-dimensional model of flooding (Sobek) was used as a tool for creating flood 
simulations.  
Results show that the three main flood regions occurred at (1) the estuary of 
Shin-Hu-Wei Creek from the Wen-Kang Bridge to the West-Mailiao Tributary 
surrounding the river catchment area, (2) the downstream area close to the inlet of 
the Hsin-Zhuang-Zi Tributary, and (3) the section from Pu-Tzu Bridge to Ho-Ping 
Bridge.

ABSTRACT 
 
In this study, the grey relational analysis was used to infer the infiltration time 
during rainfall that infiltrated into the water table, then the infiltration time was 
employed to improve the GM(1,2) to predict the changes in groundwater level. 
Finally a random process (Markov chain) was used to amend the systematic errors 
of GM(1,2). For this reason, this study has two purposes: (1) to use the grey 
relational analysis to estimate the infiltration time to improve GM(1,2), then to 
explore the possibility of predicting the groundwater level, and (2) to explore the 
feasibility of a random process (Markov chain) to amend the systematic errors of 
GM(1,2). 
In this study, four groundwater observation wells (BH05, BH06, BH08 and 
BH10) were set up. The observation data was used to analysis the infiltration time, 
to built the GM(1,2), to built the Markov chain model, and finally to combine the 
grey system with the Markov chain. 
After calculations were made, the infiltration time biT  for the wells was 
obtained (BH05: infiltration time hours, 405 bT  BH06: infiltration 
time hours, 406 bT BH08: infiltration time hours, 398 bT  BH10: infiltration 
time hours 4410 bT ). 
According to the results, the infiltration time for each well was not the same. 
This is because the field was a non-homogeneous and non-isotropic site; however 
the grey relational grade still had the similar trend. 
During the model building process, the average value of the grey 
parameters 1ˆ c  and 2ˆ c was 0.9996 and 0.0561, respectively. After testing and 
verification, the average values obtained of MAE and RMSE was 5mm and 8 mm, 
respectively. The verification accuracy was fairly good. Even though the forecast 
time was raised from one hour to 24 hours, the verification accuracy was still 
acceptable.

Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for establishing a 
three-dimensional model in urban environment 
 
Abstract 
 
Applying the satellite and aerial images to establish a 3-D model is helpful for 
urban planning, monitoring the environment, and assessing disasters. But the image 
acquired from satellites and aircrafts are generally expensive and time-consuming. 
Using UAV to acquire the images has the advantages of gaining immediate results and 
being inexpensive cost-wise. Because we do not know the position of UAV while in 
the air, the images are only used for classification and interpretation. This study 
combines the UAV system and surveying instruments to acquire the position and 
direction of the UAV in the air, and then uses the UAV system to photograph buildings. 
After acquiring the images from UAV, software was used to analyze the images. The 
assignment included correcting photos, sharpening images, and matching mosaic 
images. Finally, the images were combined with the measurement data to establish a 
3-D model. Comparison of the true features of the buildings with the 3-D model from 
this study proved to be effective. The UAV system was combined with the surface 
surveyed system to improve the applicability of the images from UAV. Future work is 
to improve the accuracy of the 3-D model.
