Abstract 
Static balance of mechanisms or machines can be sometimes necessary and benefit from the 
improvement of control and energy efficiency of the system. Under the traction of gravity, a 
statically balanced mechanism can be in static equilibrium at its any configuration without external 
supports. Spring balancing mechanism is a class of statically balanced mechanism, and is achieved 
by utilizing elastic elements, e.g. spring, as the compensating force against to the gravitational force. 
Due to special arrangements of springs, the spring deformations of a spring balancing mechanism 
can passively vary along the configuration change of the mechanism and the generated 
compensating force can perfectly match the gravitational force at various configurations. In practice, 
spring balancing mechanisms can be low-cost and compact in size with springs that can be installed 
easily.  
This dissertation introduces the principles of static balance, the underlying theory regarding the 
static equilibrium analysis of mechanism system, and investigates some interesting kinematic 
insights of spring balancing mechanisms. Based on the proposal of a stiffness matrix representation 
and spring configuration matrix representation, design methodologies to obtain spring balancing 
mechanisms for planar one-DOF, multi-DOF planar mechanisms, and spatial multi-DOF 
mechanisms are gestated. The connectivity of springs among links and the locations of spring 
attachment points can be determined accordingly for an admissible spring balancing mechanism.  
Further, an application of spring balancing mechanism is designed as the gravity-balanced upper 
limb exoskeleton. The proposed exoskeleton is conceptually able to facilitate a patient with 
muscular weakness practicing the rehabilitation exercises by counterbalancing the weight of his/her 
upper limb at any posture. A proof-of-concept prototype of the exoskeleton device is built and 
verifies the concept of the ideal, perfect and static balance.

apparatus as an example: Use a spring extending within the interior region of the second arm. The 
spring exerts a force on the interior rod and the coupled link to counterbalance the surgical light 
head. A surgeon can pull the light head to the required position; the light head will not move and 
remain its configuration until the surgeon pulls it again. The surgeon can do the surgical operation 
with both hands, and do not have to worry about the light head falling. These spring-loaded 
equilibrators were achieved by the static balance between the elastic forces of springs and the 
gravitational forces of links.

The zero-free-length spring is a spring supported in such a way that its exerted force is 
proportional to its length, rather than the distance it is compressed. In practice this is done by 
combining a spring with "negative" length (in which the coils press together when the spring is 
relaxed) with an extra length of inelastic material. This type of spring was developed in 1932 by 
Lucien LaCoste for use in a vertical seismograph. Also, in the same year, George Carwardine filed 
patents describing the same kind of spring in detail. These developments appear to be independent 
and coincidentally simultaneous. Moreover, in a 1904 patent (DE 157513), W. Lynen describes the 
characteristic of a zero-free-length spring.  
An ideal zero-free-length spring can be obtained by mechanical arrangements of normal springs 
using pulleys or alignment shafts to increase or decrease the active length of the spring. Generally, 
any passive member, which is installed to a mechanism, having a minimum length (of reaction) dmin 
and a maximum length dmax with correspondent spring forces fmin and fmax within the possible 
configurations of the mechanism is an ideal zero-free-length spring. The slope of the passive spring 
force to the spring length is constant as max min max min
( ) ( )k f f d d  
. The passive member may 
not be always an actual spring. It can be generally a mechanical object in a mechanism which the 
degree-of-freedom of the mechanism is the same with or without it. Also, the ideal zero-free-length 
spring does not strictly require that the spring has an actual zero length and a zero force in practical 
uses.

The state-of-art approaches for the spring-balancing-mechanisms are mainly achieved by 
embedding springs along with auxiliary links to form parallelogram linkages in the mechanism 
desired to be gravity-balanced. Two general arrangements of the auxiliary links were proposed; one 
is familiar as a structure of serially connected parallelogram linkages wherein each parallelogram is 
installed with a single spring [23, 25], as shown in Figs. 1.4(a); the other one uses the parallel 
auxiliary links to identify the overall mass center position of the mechanism as point C in Fig. 
1.4(b), and one of the installed springs must be fitted between the base and the mass center [26].  
The later one is referred to as a fractional mechanism. It can locate the center of mass of a planar 
6 
path of motion of linkages [28]. Throughout this dissertation, all balances and balancers are referred 
to the perfect balances. The gravity torques or forces acted on a mechanism vary along the 
configuration change of the mechanism; the wonder of SBMs is that the compensation force, 
provided by springs, can match perfectly from configuration to configuration. Gosselin (2009) 
refers to the SBMs as a class of adaptive mechanism [29] since they can adjust the compensation 
forces perfectly, passively, and yet automatically. 
 
Fig. 1.5  Fractional mechanism to locate system center of mass [26] 
 
Recently, plenty researchers interested in SBMs have devoted their works in the field of medical 
devices. By appropriate human-machine interfacing, the SBMs can be ‘worn’ on a human subject as 
an exoskeleton device. Such an exoskeleton can provide assistive forces to counterbalance the limb 
weight of the user, and facilitate the rehabilitation exercises of patients with muscular weakness. 
For example the upper extremity exoskeleton as shown in Fig. 1.2 (e), known as the WREX 
(Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton), comprises the classic parallelogram SBM, where the device 
uses rubber bands instead of metal springs which are safer. In addition to the development of the 
exoskeletons, robot-assisted devices for lower extremity had been developed. Figure 1.2(d) shows a 
leg orthosis by the pantograph-type SBM. The leg orthosis can reduce the joint torques of the lower 
extremity due to gravity during its swing phase. Initial results of these devices are promising, and 
the spring-loaded exoskeleton has advantages over its compactness and low-cost, comparing to the 
conventional therapeutic robots with actuators. Related discussions will be introduced in Chapter 5 
in detail. 
1.3. Motivation  
Spring balance provides advantages such as reduced energy consumption and improved passivity. 
Although SBM designs had been reported in many prior studies with the using of auxiliary links, 
however, the auxiliary link method has several disadvantages such as: (i) motion interferences 
between the primary links and the auxiliary links may hinder the workspace of the manipulator; (ii) 
mechanical tolerances must be carefully controlled to maintain the parallelism of auxiliary links; (iii) 
auxiliary links produce additional and comparatively large inertia to the system; and (iv) the excess 
number of parts may reduce the robustness of the manipulator. To date, SBMs without parallel 
auxiliary links are rarely proposed, and besides the auxiliary link method, a designer has almost no 
8 
of springs can be obtained for any given planar articulated manipulator with prescribed dimensions 
and inertia. Exact solutions for the locations of attachment points are given in detailed in the 
examples of a spring-loaded one-, two- and three- degrees of freedom articulated manipulators. 
  In Chapter 4, a novel methodology for the design of a gravity-balanced serial-type spatial 
manipulator is presented. In the design, gravity effects of the system can be completely 
compensated at any configuration. The gravity balance of the n-DOF manipulator is achieved by the 
suspensions of only n zero-free-length springs, where each spring is individually fitted between a 
primary link and its adjacent auxiliary link. No spring has to be installed across the spatial 
manipulator from a far remote link to ground such that the motion interference among the springs 
and the links can be prevented. Besides, since the embedded auxiliary links along the primary links 
of the manipulator form a series of spatial parallelogram RSSR modules, the active DOFs of the 
system remain the same as the primary manipulator and the range of motion of the manipulator will 
not be hindered. As a result, the n-DOF manipulator can serve the general function of an articulated 
serial-type manipulator in kinematics. Simulated results of a six-DOF gravity-balanced manipulator 
modeled on ADAMS shows that the static equilibrium as well as the kinematics of the system can 
be successfully accomplished by this proposed methodology. 
In Chapter 5, design of an upper limb exoskeleton for the therapeutic rehabilitation of stroke 
patients with hemiparesis is proposed. This exoskeleton which consists of no actuating motors or 
sensory devices is simple and inexpensive, but with similar benefits as other therapeutic robots can 
provide. With a three-DOF shoulder joint and a one-DOF elbow joint, this exoskeleton allows a 
nearly full range of motion of the upper limb to carry out the required movements of shoulder girdle, 
shoulder internal-external rotation, abduction-adduction, flexion-extension and elbow 
flexion-extension. With embedded spring elements, this exoskeleton is able to reduce the gravity 
torques on shoulder and elbow joints of the upper limb of a patient to perform the activities of daily 
livings on his/her own control. Depending on how the movement ability of the upper limb is 
improved, the magnitude of the joint torques can be altered simply by the adjustment of the spring 
attachment points on the exoskeleton. Design of the gravity-reduction upper limb exoskeleton is 
based on the conservation of gravitational and elastic potential energy of the system and the 
anthropometric parameters obtained from a statistical regression model. Modeling of the system to 
fulfill a combing hair motion in ADAMS has demonstrated the success of the design, and a 
prototype is fabricated to verify the overall concept of the proposed design. 
 
2. Planar One-DOF Spring Balancing Linkage 
2.1. Introduction 
Over the years, the “perfect” spring balances of a single link [17, 22, 23], single 
degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar linkages [14] and spatial multi-DOF mechanisms [25, 26, 30] 
were investigated. The “perfect equilibration” refers to a system which is in static equilibrium at its 
all configurations where the effect of gravity is fully eliminated from the system of interest [23, 24]. 
10 
of ground and the ground-adjacent links has to be equal to that of the base vectors, certain one-DOF 
planar linkages are not admissible for the design of the SBMs with springs alone. Feasible one-DOF 
SBMs are systematically enumerated by assigning different ground location to a kinematic chain 
and the static balance of the linkage is accomplished by fitting a ground-attached spring with 
specified design parameters to its corresponding link. 
 
2.2. Gravitational potential energy of general planar linkages 
The gravitational potential energy of a link of a planar linkage can be represented by the scalar 
product of the position vector of the mass center and the vector of the gravitational force of the link. 
For simplicity and without suffering the complicated algebraic operations of trigonometric 
functions, complex number notations are used for vectors in the derivations for both elastic and 
gravitational potential energies of the system. Consider link i as any link of a planar linkage as 
shown in Fig. 2.1, where ri is an arbitrary vector fixed on link i, and points A, B and C are fixed on 
link i. Link vector rAB can be written as

where | . | denotes the magnitude of the vector inside the norm, α is the angle measured from vectors 
ri to rAB, (|rAB|/|ri|) is the elongation ratio of vector rAB with respect to vector ri, and pik is the 
constant coefficient transforming vector ri to vector rAB on loop k. Since both vectors ri and rAB are 
fixed on link i, coefficient pik is independent to the configuration of the linkage and, hence, pik is a 
constant coefficient expressed in exponential form of a complex number. Note that, all vectors 
hereafter are represented in boldface characters, while constant coefficients are not.

Since the link vector on link i and loop k can be represented by pikri, link vectors rBC and rCA can be 
represented by pi3ri and pi2ri, respectively. Note that, if link i is not on loop k, pik is equal to zero, 
e.g., pi1 in Fig. 2.1 is zero. Also note that, throughout the chapter, all angles are measured 
counterclockwise and the directions of link vectors pi2ri, pi3ri and pikri, etc. are in accordance with 
the direction of their corresponding loop as illustrated in Fig.2.1 unless specified otherwise.  
  Referring to the general planar linkage in Fig. 2.2, Mi is the mass center of link i and Ri is the

where qij = -(qj/qi), α is the angle measured from vectors rj to ri, and (|ri |/|rj |) is the elongation ratio 
of the magnitudes of vector ri with respect to rj. The kinematic constraint depicted in Eq. (2.6) 
suggests that links i and j have the same angular velocity, i.e., links i and j are always kept in a same 
relative angle of orientation. If links i and j are adjacent, they are considered rigidly connected since 
there is no relative motion between the two links. However, if links i and j are not adjacent, the two 
links are in parallel motion and Eq. (2.6) is referred to the case where the two links are subjected to 
a kinematic constraint of parallel motion. A parallel kinematic constraint can be resulted from the 
special arrangement of the link dimensions, e.g., the lengths of the parallel links of a parallelogram 
must be equal.  
On the other hand, for a multi-loop, planar linkage, each independent loop represents a linear 
kinematic constraint to the motion of the links of the planar linkage. The loop closure equation of 
loop k can be represented as

For a one-DOF, n-link, planar linkage, the number of the independent loops is (n/2-1) [34]. Writing 
Eq. (2.7) for each independent loop k yields a total number of (n/2-1) linearly independent vector 
equations with n link vectors. The number of linearly independent link vectors of the linkage is then 
obtained by subtracting the number of loop closure equations from that of link vectors as

where B is referred to the set of linearly independent link vectors or the base vectors of the linkage, 
and #{B} represents the number of the base vectors. A set of base vectors, or a basis, is a spanning 
set of a vector space, where all vectors in that space can be represented by the linear combination of 
the base vectors in the set. For example, if B = {v1, v2, …, vn} is a basis of vector space V, any 
vector v V can be expressed uniquely by the linear combination of the basis B as v = 
β1v1+β2v2+…+βnvn where scalars β1, β2, …, βn are the coordinates of vector space V with respect to 
the basis B. 
Solving the (n/2-1) loop closure equations simultaneously, any link vector ri of the linkage can 
be expressed by the linear combination of the base vectors as

properties of the linkage as indicated in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4), while, in Eq. (2.7), c'k contains only the 
geometric information of the linkage from the loop closure equations and other kinematic 
constraints. Note that, through manipulating the mass center locations and the masses of links, it is 
possible to adjust one or more of the coefficients c"k to be zero. As a result, the number of linearly 
independent base vectors for the formulation of the gravitational potential energy can be further 
reduced. Manipulation on masses and locations of mass centers can be easily achieved by the 
counterweight method or using extremely lightweight links. Design of a SBM utilizing a hybrid 
method of both counterweights and springs method is also possible. Such a hybrid method uses less 
number of springs and, thus, reduces the possibility of sabotage of the integrity of the design due to 
the possible spring relaxation with time. 
 
2.3. Elastic potential energy of ground-attached springs 
If the elastic potential energy of the springs fitted in a one-DOF planar linkage can be 
represented by the same base vectors used in the formulation of the gravitational potential energy in 
Eq. (2.11), static balance of the system becomes possible. Referring to the ground-adjacent link 
fitted with a spring as shown in Fig. 2.3, where link 1 represents ground, link j is the inverted 
pendulum connected to ground via a fixed pivot, and θj is the orientation angle of vector rj 
measured with respect to the positive real axis. By fitting a zero free-length, extensional, linear 
spring on link j, the elastic potential energy of the ground-adjacent link can be obtained as

Note that, referring to the ground-adjacent link in Fig. 2.3 and based on Eq. (2.19b), the installing 
angle of the spring can be represented by λj= αj-βj-θj. = - arg( c"j )-θj. This indicates that the spring 
installation angle λj varies as the ground-adjacent link rotates and, thus, the variation of the 
gravitational potential energy of the system at any configuration can be fully compensated by that 
of the elastic potential energy of the spring if the conditions in Eq. (2.19) are satisfied. Also note 
that, in addition to the geometry and mass properties of the linkage, the spring constant kj in Eq. 
(2.19) depends on the magnitudes of both spring installation vectors aj and bj. In general, the value 
of spring constant kj can be arbitrarily adjusted simply by tuning the attached ends of the spring to 
other corresponding position. For example, if a stiffer spring is desired, smaller magnitudes of 
vectors aj and bj have to be used. On the contrary, if a softer spring is used, larger magnitudes of 
vectors aj and bj are required. Therefore, if the gravitational potential energy of the linkage can be 
formulated by the expression of all ground-adjacent links, the entire gravitational potential energy 
of the system is fully decoupled and can be balanced by the elastic potential energy of the spring 
fitted on each of the ground-attached links. Since no auxiliary parallel links are used for the static 
balance of a linkage, such a design is considered efficient and less complex. 
 
2.4. Feasible linkage and its associated spring installation configuration 
2.4.1. General spring balancing linkages 
A one-DOF, n-link, planar linkage with (n/2) ground-adjacent links can be perfectly balanced by 
attaching a spring to each of the ground-adjacent links. By the use of the graph representation [36], 
ten feasible springs balancing four-, six- and eight-link graphs are obtained as illustrated in Table 
2.1, where links are represented by vertices, joints by edges, ground link by double vertices, and 
springs by double slash lines. A double slash line represents that a spring is fitted between the 
ground vertex and its adjacent vertex. The linkages in Table 2.1 are referred to the SBMs of type A 
where the numbers of the ground-adjacent links and the variant base vectors are both equal to (n/2). 
Note that, the number and the lowercase alphabetic letters represent the number of links and distinct 
graph structures, respectively. For instance, graphs “A6a” and “A6b” are both six-link, type-A 
SBMs with different structures. 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
base vectors are both (n/2-1). For a one-DOF, n-link, planar linkage with (n/2-1) ground adjacent 
links, the admissible graphs can be obtained by kinematic inversion of the graphs in Table 2.2 and 
are illustrated in Table 2.3. Note that, in Table 2.2, the degrees of the ground vertices of the graphs 
are all (n/2), while those in Table 2.3 are equal to (n/2-1). Clearly, for the six-link linkages, only the 
Watt-I, Stephenson-I and II mechanisms appear in Table 2.3. They correspond to graph numbers 
B6c, B6d and B6e, respectively. Lastly, since the degrees of all vertices in a four-bar linkage equal 
to two, Table 2.3 contains graphs of six-link linkages only.

ground-adjacent links and (n/2-1) springs up to six links (n: number of links) 
 
Table 2.3 Graph representations of one-DOF, n-link, spring balancing parallel mechanisms with 
(n/2-1) ground-adjacent links up to six links (n: number of links) 
 
   
In Tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, the SBMs are categorized into two types: Type-A linkages are referred 
to general SBMs containing (n/2) ground-adjacent links with (n/2) ground-attached springs fitted 
between ground and each of the ground-adjacent links. Type-B linkages are referred to SBMs with 
degenerated number of springs. Note that, for type-B linkage, the additional kinematic constraints 
have to be linearly independent to the loop closure equations.

Equation (2.32) shows that the gravitational potential energy of the parallelogram four-bar linkage 
can be described by one variant base vector r2, thus, the system requires only one ground-attached 
spring for the static balance of the system. The spring design conditions are obtained by replacing 
the constant coefficient cj" with c2''' in Eq. (2.19). In comparison with a general four-bar linkage, 
the number of springs required in a statically balanced parallelogram four-bar linkage is 
degenerated by one. It is to be note that, for a parallelogram four-bar linkage, the spring can be 
fitted between ground and link 2 or between links 4 (or 2) and 3. Because of the parallel motion, the 
coupler link, link 3, provides a ‘pseudo’ ground at the distal end. This is the main reason for many 
designers to adopt parallel auxiliary links in the spring balancing linkages.

Fitting a ground-attached spring to each of ground-adjacent links 2 and 4, respectively, and 
followed by the cancellation of the variations of the gravitational potential energy and the elastic 
potential energy of the system, the design parameters of the spring can be obtained via Eq. (2.18). 
This example demonstrates that the design of a statically balanced one-DOF, n-link, planar parallel 
linkage with (n/2-1) ground-adjacent link can be accomplished by using degenerated number of 
springs.  
The motions of the Stephenson-III type six-bar linkage of Fig. 2.4, the parallelogram four-bar 
linkage of Fig. 2.5 and the Watt-I type six-bar linkage of Fig. 2.6 are simulated by ADAMS and the 
gravitational, elastic and total potential energies verse crank angle for an entire cycle are plotted in 
Figs. 2.7(a), 2.7(b) and 2.7(c), respectively. Figure 2.7 shows that the variations of the gravitational 
potential energies of both systems can be perfectly compensated by that of the elastic potential 
energies of the ground-attached springs. 
  In general, a Watt-I linkage with only two ground-adjacent links can not be statically balanced 
with ground-attached springs alone. However, due to the inclusion of the kinematic constraint of 
parallel motion, the number of the base vectors required in the formulation of the gravitational 
potential energy of the Watt-I linkage is degenerated by one. Hence, only two ground-attached 
springs are needed. The concept of degeneration of the linearly independent vectors in the 
formulation of the gravitational potential energy of the planar linkage can be extended to linkages of 
higher links. With the aid of graph representations, more feasible higher-link SBMs can be 
enumerated systematically. In practice, static balance of a one-DOF, n-link planar linkage with less 
than (n/2) ground-adjacent links can be obtained, as long as the kinematic constraint equations are 
linearly independent to the existed loop closure equations.

required. Design of a statically balanced, one-DOF, n-link, planar linkage with (n/2) 
ground-adjacent links can be accomplished by fitting a ground-attached spring to each of the 
ground-adjacent links. Admissible graphs of one-DOF planar linkages of up to eight links are 
enumerated. It is also shown that the SBMs with degenerated number of the springs can be obtained, 
provided that the prescribed kinematic constraints of the linkage are linearly independent to the 
inherited loop closure equations. This methodology is successfully demonstrated by the designs of 
the static balances of a general Stephenson-III type six-bar linkage with (n/2) ground-adjacent links 
and a Watt-I type six-bar linkage of parallel motion with (n/2-1) ground-adjacent links. Results are 
simulated and justified by the software ADAMS. 
 
3. Planar Multi-DOF Spring Balancing Articulated Linkage 
3.1 Introduction 
In the field of statically balanced mechanisms, a large number of designs of planar articulated 
manipulators are embedded with parallel auxiliary links and elastic elements. Such springs produce 
an equal but opposite torque at each revolute joint to that produced by the weight of manipulator 
links at any configuration to achieve the perfect balance. The parallel auxiliary links provide the 
suitable locations of spring attachment points. The design approach is easy to apply for planar 
articulated manipulators. However, the parallelogram structures of such designs have several 
disadvantages: (i) motion interferences between the primary links and the auxiliary links may 
hinder the workspace of the manipulator; (ii) mechanical tolerances must be carefully controlled to 
maintain the parallelism of auxiliary links; (iii) auxiliary links produce additional inertia to the 
system; and (iv) the excess number of parts may reduce the robustness of the manipulator. More 
importantly, besides the auxiliary link method, a designer has almost no foundation to determine the 
spring installation for a general planar articulated manipulator. 
The nature of static balance of a system with springs is the energy exchanged equally between 
the gravitational potential energy and the elastic potential energy. The gravitational forces, like 
spring forces, resist or assist the configuration change of a mechanism from an equilibrium 
configuration. In this chapter, a generalized stiffness of mechanism based on the derivation of 
potential energy is proposed. Such a generalized stiffness is formulated in a constant block matrix, 
referred to as a stiffness block matrix, and is used for the analysis of static equilibrium. Traditionally, 
the stiffness matrix of a manipulator is derived from the coordinate transformations between the 
actuator space and the end effecter space [38, 39]. Such stiffness matrix is a relation between the 
end effecter output forces and joint actuating torques, and it is configuration dependent. The 
stiffness block matrix of this paper is, however, configuration independent and constant for a 
mechanism with given dimensions and inertia. Such quantity is physically close to the sense of the 
spring constant of Hooke’s law. 
In this chapter, a methodology is developed to determine the spring installation for the design of 
statically balanced planar articulated linkage without parallel auxiliary links. The spring installation

where φ is the relative angle, measured counterclockwise, between vector r and the unit vector qi 
and angle φ is constant at any configuration of the rigid body u. 
Consider a zero-free-length spring with labeled number j, spring constant kj and its two ends 
attached arbitrarily to links u* and v* of a serial kinematic chain as illustrated in Fig. 3.1, where 
link u* is closer to the ground than link v*. The vectors of interest in Fig. 3.1 are aj, bj and ru, and 
they can be respectively represented by

where matrices aj and bj contain the positioning parameters of the spring attachment points on links

3.3 Stiffness block matrix representation of gravitational potential energy 
Gravitational potential energy of a mechanism varies along with the configuration change of the 
mechanism. Consequently, the gravitational force behaves physically as the spring force resisting or 
assisting the configuration change of the mechanism from an equilibrium configuration. Hence, an 
intuitive idea is motivated to formulate the gravitational potential energy in the matched form as 
that of Eq. (3.12). Due to the same reason that the bilinear form by the conventional basis Q = [θ1, 
θ2,…, θn] is difficult to be obtained, configuration block matrix Q is employed. 
As illustrated in Fig. 3.2, the mass center position vector pi of link i in a planar linkage can be 
obtained along a path passing all centers of pre-connected revolute joints. The path starts from an 
origin of a fixed frame on the ground link, passes through each link u, and then ends on link i. Thus, 
the mass center position vector pi can be represented by

Matrix Dv is referred to as a gravitational component in the stiffness block matrix. According to Eqs. 
(3.21) and (3.22), a gravitational component Dv contains the dimensional and inertia parameters of 
the given planar manipulator. These parameters affect the gravitational forces or moments acting on 
the planar manipulator. A given manipulator has a constant and unique stiffness block matrix 
g
K 
that characterize the effects of gravity at different configurations. 
 
3.4 Static balance of the stiffness block matrix

be obtained as

where the overall stiffness block matrix K = [Kuv ]. Since a non-zero component matrix Kuv can be 
considered as a pseudo stiffness component embedded between links u and v, change of the relative 
angular displacement θuv = cos
-1
(qu
T 
qv) between links u and v induces a variation of potential 
energy qu
T 
Kuvqv to the system. Therefore, for a gravity-balanced system, all stiffness components 
between any two distinct links should be zeros, i.e., any off-diagonal component matrix Kuv for u ≠ 
v in K is a zero matrix. Thus, the overall stiffness block matrix becomes a diagonal block matrix as

The conditions that satisfy Eq. (3.27) yield design equations to solve for the design parameters of a 
feasible configuration of spring installation. 
Since the stiffness block matrix is the sum of a skew-symmetric matrix and a diagonal matrix, 
thus only the component matrices on the upper triangular part of the stiffness block matrix, i.e. 
Kuv’s for v > u, are considered. Now, consider the stiffness block matrix due to gravity 
g
K. The 
gravity force acted on link v and its reciprocal force on the ground yields the stiffness components 
g
K1v for v = 2, 3, …, n. On the other hands, all 
g
Kuv ’s are zero matrices for u ≠ 1 in 
g
K. Hence, the 
stiffness block matrix 
g
K is in the following form:

described in an abstract (n-1)-dimensional space constituted of the (n-1) independent vectors qi’s. 
Since Kii for i = 2, 3,…, n is a 2×2 diagonal matrix, i.e. Kii =kiiI. Hence, by Eq. (3.28),

In the current studies of the auxiliary link method, two general arrangements of the auxiliary 
links were proposed; one is familiar as a structure of serially connected parallelogram linkages 
wherein each parallelogram is installed with a single spring; the other one uses the parallel auxiliary 
links to identify the overall mass center position of the mechanism, and one of the installed springs 
must be fitted between in the base and the mass center, this arrangement may require a larger 
operating space for the spring pending on the position of masse center. In comparison to both 
arrangements, the design without auxiliary links in the paper can disregard the motion interferences 
between the auxiliary links and the primary links, and avoid any of the singularity problems which 
may occur, and thus, simplify the design process. However, using the multi-articular springs though 
may force these springs traversing a potentially large workspace. By selecting springs with 
appropriate stiffness, it may yield a design with spring attachment points close to the rotation 
centers of articular joint, i.e. short lengths aj and bj. Consequently, the operating space of the 
multi-articular springs can be minified.

z can provide four design parameters, namely az, αz, bz and βz, to the design equations, three 
installed springs provide with a total number of twelve design parameters. For links 1, 2, 3 and 4 of 
the manipulator, springs 1, 2 and 3 are installed with unrepeated spring configurations 1(1, 4), 2(2, 4) 
and 3(1, 3), respectively. Apply the sum and difference formulas for the sine and cosine functions to 
the twelve design equations, and define twelve auxiliary variables Xi ’s for i = 1, 2, …, 12 as

3.8 Determination of the spring configuration 
3.8.1 Minimum number of springs 
Referring to the spring j in Fig. 3.1, each spring possesses one design parameter as the spring 
constant kj and four design parameters as the positioning constants aj, αj, bj and βj for the attachment 
ends of the spring. These design parameters are unknowns to be solved through the design 
equations given in Eqs. (3.30) and (3.32). Let spring constants kj’s for j = 1, 2,…, N be the free 
variables and are arbitrarily given. For a manipulator with N fitted springs, a total number of 4N 
design parameters in the design equations are required to be solved. Since, in general, the number of 
unknowns must be greater or equal to the number of the simultaneous equations, 
44 
non-zero spring component matrices. Now, consider the (2, n)
th
 entry of the overall stiffness block 
matrix, i.e., K2n. Since there is no gravitational influence but only the elastic influence 
1
K2n by 
spring 
1
S1n, a second spring, denoted as 
2
S2n, has to be fitted between links 2 and n in order to 
generate a counterbalancing component matrix 
2
K2n to compensate the influence 
1
K2n by spring 
1
S1n. 
Hence,  
C2: For an n-link planar SBAM, a spring is required to be attached between the ground-pivoted 
link and the end link and element λ2n of an n× n spring configuration matrix Λ is equal to 1 for any 
n greater than or equal to 2. 
Note that, since the gravity induces non-zero component matrices on only the first row (and the first 
column) of the stiffness block matrix, the equilibrium for each of relative angular displacements 
θ1v’s for v = 2, 3, …, n are achieved by one gravitational influence and one or more elastic 
influences. While the equilibrium for each of relative angular displacements θuv’s for u, v ≠ 1 is 
accomplished by two or more elastic influences. 
  For a set of simultaneous equations having non-zero solutions, the number of unknowns in any 
subset of the equations has to be greater or equal to the number of equations of the subset. Consider 
the subset of equations by the component matrices on the (u*)
th
 row or the (v*)
th
 column of the 
stiffness block matrix. There are (n – u*) component matrices on the (u*)th row as Ku*(u*+1), Ku*(u* 
+2),…, Ku*n; and (v* - 1) component matrices on the (v*)
th
 column as K1v*, K2v*,…, K(v*-1)v*. 
Respectively, there are 2(n - u*) equations and 2(v* - 1) equations by the (u*)
th
 row and the (v*)
th
 
column of the stiffness block matrix. Now, consider the number of unknowns. For each fitted spring 
j
Su*v*, i.e., λu*v* = 1, four distinct unknowns aj, αj, bj and βj are added to the system. According to Eq. 
(3.8), component matrix 
j
Ku*v* possesses all the four unknowns of spring 
j
Su*v*, and each component 
matrix 
j
Kuv for either u = u* or v = v* possesses two unknowns of spring 
j
Su*v*. Therefore, the 
number of spring design parameters in the equations by component matrices on row u* of the 
stiffness block matrix, nR,u*, is

Fig. 3.8  An inadmissible spring configuration matrix violating C4 
 
According to Eq. (3.31), it is observed that a spring attached between links u* and v* affects 
stiffness components between links u*, (u*+1),…, and v*. If a spring is fitted between two adjacent 
links, i.e. 
j
Su*(u*+1) for u* = 1, 2,…, (n - 1), such a spring is referred to as a mono-articular spring 
since one and only one articulated joint is spanned over by the spring. A mono-articular spring 
affects the stiffness between two adjacent links, all four design parameters of the mono-articular 
spring 
j
Su*(u*+1) exist only in component matrix Ku*(u*+1) of an overall stiffness block matrix. Since 
Ku*(u*+1) = 0 yields two design equations, two out of the four design parameters must be given. 
Hence, a mono-articular spring has only two available parameters to the overall simultaneous 
equations. Further, since the number of design parameters by using the minimum number of spring 
is 4N*, according to Eqs. (3.68) and (3.69), the number of design parameters exceeds the number of 
equations by

where Z denotes the set of integers. Equation (3.79) suggests that the number of design parameters 
is equal to the number of equations when n(n - 1)/4 is an integer. Thus, all design parameters must 
be available unknowns to the design equations, and hence, no mono-articular spring can be used. 
On the other hand, when n(n - 1)/4 is not an integer, two design parameters must be given in 
advance and one and only one mono-articular spring can be used.

Upon an admissible spring configuration, the total potential energy as shown in Eq. (3.28) is

to the auxiliary link method, the design without auxiliary links in the paper can disregard the motion 
interferences between the auxiliary links and the primary links, and avoid any of the singularity 
problems which may occur, and thus, simplify the design process.  
The methodology proposed in this paper can be generally applied for planar articulated 
manipulators and hence provide an alternative, and also attractive, design approach. Two major 
matrices are proposed, namely the configuration block matrix and the stiffness block matrix. By the 
stiffness block matrix representation, spring configurations can be determined through the 
placements of elastic and gravitational components in the block matrix. An isotropic stiffness block 
matrix provides the design equations for the determination of spring attachment points. Exact 
solutions of the design equations are given with details in the examples of a spring-loaded one-, 
two- and three-DOF articulated manipulators, in which, the spring installation of the three-DOF 
gravity-balanced manipulator is novel. Simulation results showed that the static equilibrium is 
achieved at any reachable region of the manipulators. Based on the structural analysis of the 
stiffness block matrix, five necessary conditions are identified as fundamental characteristics for an 
admissible spring configuration.  
The spring configuration of a SBAM is represented by a proposed configuration matrix. 
Admissible spring configurations are enumerated for one-, two-, three- and four-DOF planar 
articulated manipulators. Thus, it demonstrates that the methodology can successfully provide 
several candidate designs with novel spring arrangements. Further, by using the robustness index, 
an optima selection of the admissible spring configurations can be followed. 
 
4. Design of a Spatial Multi-DOF Spring Balancing Articulated 
Manipulator 
4.1 Introduction 
Extensive studies on the designs of perfectly gravity-balanced planar mechanisms comprising of 
zero-free-length springs had been reported. One of the difficulties for the design of a spring 
balancing mechanism comes from the selection of the spring attachment points to generate an exact 
amount of forces or torques to counter-balance the gravity effects of the whole mechanism during 
motions. Passive auxiliary links are usually used to trace the center of gravity and to provide proper 
attachment points for fitted springs. Nevertheless, while the spring balancing techniques are applied 
to a spatial mechanism, e.g. a manipulator, the arrangement of auxiliary links and springs becomes 
complicated and cumbersome. Although numerous gravity-balanced designs of spatial serial-type 
mechanisms have been proposed [8, 10, 13, 18, 25, 31], most of them are only applicable to specific 
applications due to the limited degrees of freedom (DOFs) or the restricted orientations of the joint 
axes of the mechanisms. Designs of spring-loaded gravity-balanced spatial manipulator with the 
ability to serve a general spatial motion are few. Recently, Agrawal and Fattah [26] proposed a 
methodology for the gravity balance of a general spatial manipulator by the use of pantograph-alike,

Then, Eq. (4.9b) can be satisfied at any configuration of the link. Equation (4.10) is thus a sufficient 
condition of Eq. (4.9b) and is the equilibrium condition of the single-link equilibrator. In order to 
satisfy the condition of Eq. (4.10), one of the easiest arrangement is to install a spring at the 
attachment points with OA’ parallel to the direction of gravity and OB’ parallel to the position 
vector of the mass center. With such arrangement, spring constant K and the magnitudes of a and b 
can be readily selected according to Eq. (4.10). Once the spring attachment points A’ and B’ are 
determined, a spring triangle A’B’O is formed. In general, as shown in Fig. 4.2 any spring 
attachment points A and B forming a spring triangle ABC congruent and parallel to A’B’O guarantee 
the same spring deflected length AB and the equilibrium condition of the system remains satisfied.  
  According to Eq. (4.6), the gravitational potential energy of subsystem i can be considered 
equivalently as a rigid body mounted on ground with the mass of μi and with σi as its position vector 
of mass center. The gravitational potential energy of subsystem i can be expressed as

4.4 Realization of pseudo-bases by series of spatial parallelogram RSSR modules 
4.4.1 Kinematics of a spatial parallelogram RSSR linkage 
The kinematic requirement of a pseudo-base is that the line drawn between the spring attachment 
point Ai and the spherical joint Ci always remains vertical regardless of the motion of link i. Such a 
parallel motion between the pseudo-base and ground can be achieved by the application of a spatial 
parallelogram linkage. As shown in Fig. 4.5, an arbitrary spatial parallelogram RSSR 
(revolute-spherical-spherical-revolute) linkage can be defined by the twist angle α and the constant 
lengths of PQ, QN, NO, OP and QM. The features of the spatial parallelogram RSSR linkage are: 
axes of the revolute joints at P and M are parallel; points P, Q and M are on the same plane; lengths 
PQ and QN are equal to lengths NO and OP, respectively. By the mobility equation [34], an RSSR 
mechanism has one active DOF and one idle DOF [43] as

Due to the special geometrical arrangement of parallelogram PQNO, the active DOF allows links

configuration. The idle DOF allows link 3 to spin axially about the line passing through the two 
spherical joints O and N. Hence, if line PQ is in vertical direction with respect to a base, link 3 is a 
pseudo-base with line ON remaining vertical at all times. Furthermore, the line jointing any two 
arbitrary points N’ and O’ on links 2 and 4, respectively, is also a vertical line if quadrilateral

  The spherical joints can be realized by ball joints or spherical mechanisms. However, a ball joint 
usually suffers from a limited range of rotation and induces a singular configuration, resulting in a 
limited range of motion of the mechanism. A singularity-free spherical joint had been proposed and 
can be applied [44]. 
 
4.5 Gravity balance of the spatial manipulator 
Referring to the spatial equilibrator as shown in Fig. 4.7, the gravity effects due to the 
pseudo-bases and the auxiliary links can be considered as follows. Since the auxiliary links are 
connected serially along with the primary links of the manipulator, the total gravitational potential 
energy of the auxiliary links can be derived in a similar form as that of Eq. (4.5) as

 and the combined mass center position vector

represented by constant coordinates of frame i. Thus, by replacing μi and σi of Eq. (4.16) with the 
modified parameters
ˆ
i and
ˆ
iσ , the balancing conditions of the spatial manipulator can be obtained 
with the spring stiffness and the spring installing lengths, for each link i. 
 
4.6 A simulated model of a six-DOF gravity-balanced manipulator 
Figure 4.8 shows a six-DOF, six-link industrial manipulator with all-revolute joints. Since the 
axis of the first joint between ground and link 1 is in the direction of gravity, the total gravitational 
potential energy induced by the rotation of link 1 about the first joint axis does not change. Hence, 
the problem for the gravity balance of the considered manipulator is simplified to obtain the static 
equilibrium of the remaining five links. As shown in Fig. 4.8, five pseudo-bases and five auxiliary 
links are added to the system. Although the simulation model shown may have motion interferences 
at certain postures, an actual embodiment of a system without interference is possible if links are 
properly shaped. Since each pair of the auxiliary link and the primary link has identical direction of 
rotation, their instantaneous working planes, which are normal to the instantaneous rotation axes, 
can be parallel. Frames i and iˆ  are respectively attached to link i and auxiliary link i for i = 0, 1, 
2, …, 6. The Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters [45] of the manipulator for frames i and iˆ are

Figure 4.9 shows the results of the simulated motion described in Eq. (4.26). The total potential 
energy of the system remained constant throughout the entire range of motion of the industrial 
manipulator, where the functions of gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy with 
respect to time are equal but opposite to each other. As a result, the gravity effect of the system is 
fully eliminated and a perfect gravity balance of the system is accomplished.

performing everyday activities such as normal walking, raising arms or grasping objects, etc. As a 
result, hemiparetic patients are prone to avoid using their weakened limbs. Such a behavior is 
referred to as a behavior of“learned non-use”. Since the repetitive use of impaired limbs may 
encourage brain plasticity and help to reduce disabilities of limbs, compensatory exercise programs 
in rehabilitating therapy are established to help stroke survivors to recover from the aftermath of the 
disease and to regain the best quality of life as much as possible. Therapeutic rehabilitation for the 
patients with hemiparesis is classified into "passive" and "active" rehabilitation, where the former 
one is referred to the exercises of an impaired limb conducted by a physical therapist, while the later 
one is referred to the exercises performed by the patient at his/her own will. Regardless of the types 
of rehabilitated exercises, the shoulder and elbow joints of the impaired limb have to sustain the 
torques due to the weight of the upper limb, the inertia force of the motion and the stretched force 
resulted from the muscular compliance. Since the movement of an impaired limb in the process of 
rehabilitation is comparatively slow, the inertia force of the motion and the stretched force can be 
neglected and, hence, the joint torques are primarily due to the weight of the upper limb.  
  Since the health care cost involved in the therapeutic rehabilitation associated with the 
stroke-related disability is increased drastically, efforts toward developing robotic-assisted treatment 
are in needs. Following the pioneering study of the MIT-Manus [47] in 1997, numerous 
robot-assisted therapeutic devices, such as the ARM-guide [48], the MAHI exoskeleton [49], the 
CADEN-7 [50], etc., had been developed in recent years. Lum et al. (2002) reported a comparison 
study between the robot-assisted therapy and the conventional therapy [51]. It is found in the report 
that, patients who were treated by robot-assisted therapy benefited from the highly repetitive motion 
of exercises and precisely quantitative needs which is offered to a specific subject, and recovered 
more movement ability than those didn’t. It was shown that the ability of arm movement for the 
acute and chronic stroke patients could be greatly improved by robot-assisted rehabilitation.  
  Since most robotic rehabilitation devices are actively actuated, Kahn et al. (2006) challenged: "Is 
the expense of an actuated device needed to achieve therapeutic benefit? " [52] and "Could similar 
benefits be achieved with simpler, less expensive, non-robotic technology that facilitates movement 
practice? ". Several non-powered rehabilitated and assistive devices have been proposed recently, 
e.g., Freebal [53], ARMON [54], WREX [20], T-WREX [55], etc. These devices are safer, less 
expensive and more environmental protective since no actuators are required. Among them, the 
Freebal is a sling system comprising of an ideal spring balancing mechanism. The weight of the 
upper limb can be passively compensated by the suspension of vertical cables, and thus, the design 
benefits from its large range of motion (ROM). However, the device is also of a large size compared 
to the others [8]. The ARMON is a device with a structure similar to a robotic arm having its 
end-effector connected to the center of mass of a patient’s upper limb. The weight counterbalance is 
achieved by applying the spring balancing techniques of a spring-loaded anthropomorphic arm [10]. 
Compared with an exoskeleton device, an end-effector based device prevents joint misalignments. 
However, it is reported to have motion interferences between the device and the upper limb, and 
confines the ROM of the upper limb because the end-effector must be connected to the center of 
66 
both on a plane normal to a vertical plane. The x2-y2 plane is referred to the plane of swivel.

5.2 Exoskeleton configuration assembly 
As illustrated in Fig. 5.1, the human GH joint is connected to the movable scapula, and the 
scapula is connected to the human trunk through the acromioclavicular joint and the 
sternoclavicular joint. Thus, the GH center (and the scapula) can travel on a curved line known as 
the movements of shoulder girdle [57] and such motion is often neglected by most studies, resulting 
in the misalignment and uncomfortableness for an exoskeleton device. The uncomfortable reaction 
force on the GH joint may be significant when the upper arm is highly elevated. 
  Design of the exoskeleton is illustrated in Fig. 5.4. The exoskeleton is constituted of two parts as 
the posterior linkage and the arm linkage, and the arm linkage is connected to the posterior linkage 
with the scapular link to accommodate the movement of the shoulder girdle. The posterior linkage 
is constituted of two parallelogram linkages and a coupler link where the parallelogram linkages 
with horizontal joint axes allow the superior-inferior motion of the GH joint and maintain the joint 
axes on the coupler link in vertical direction at any configuration. The vertical joint axes on the 
coupler link and the scapular link provide the required anterior-posterior motion of the GH joint. 
The arm linkage is a four-DOF kinematic chain of links 1, 2, 3 and 4 where links 3 and 4 are 
attached to the upper arm and the forearm, respectively. The first three rotational DOFs are achieved 
by three joint axes parallel to axes z0, z1 and z2 of the kinematic model of upper limb, respectively, 
while the fourth DOF is made up with a revolute joint of axis z3 aligned with the HU joint axis. The 
parallel arrangement of joint axes can prevent the motion interferences between the exoskeleton and 
the upper limb. Note that, the rotational motions of the arm linkage accompany the motion of the 
posterior linkage: rotation θ1 is accomplished by the vertical joint axis of link 1 and the 
anterior-posterior motion of the scapular link; rotation θ2 is through the horizontal joint axis of link 
1 and the superior-inferior motion of the scapular link. Patients with various upper arm lengths can 
be fitted with an adjustable length of link 3.

energy of a double pendulum lying on an inclined plane, that is, the plane of swivel with projected 
gravitational acceleration (gsinθ2). Thus, spring balancing technique of a double pendulum with two 
zero-free-length springs can be applied. The arrangement of the springs is as illustrated in Fig. 5.5 
where points A, B and C are the spring attachment points on CSs 2, 4 and 3, respectively. The elastic

moment of spring k1 on the elbow joint. In practice, the zero free-length spring can be made by 
matching the pretension of the non-zero free-length spring to the actual free-length, or by 
combining cables and pulleys or alignment shafts.

sinusoidal displacement function of θ2 according to Eq. (5.13). It is resulted from the sinusoidal 
changing of the gravitational component projected on the plane of swivel following rotation θ2. To 
the moving spring attachment point A, design of a shoulder mechanism is proposed as schematically 
shown in Fig. 5.6, wherein an auxiliary link, link 5, is connected to link 2 with a prismatic joint 
along a direction parallel to the x2-axis. The attachment point A is fixed on link 5. Kinematic chain 
of links 1, 2, 5 and 6 is a RPPR (Revolute-Prismatic-Prismatic-Revolute) four-bar linkage as shown 
in Fig. 5.6(b), the RPPR four-bar linkage is also an inversion of the scotch yoke mechanism. Thus, 
link 5 is passively sliding on link 2 with a harmonic motion, and the displacement a of the prismatic 
joint in term of θ2 is

where p is the constant offset distance as shown in Fig. 5.6. To match the spring design equation

The shoulder mechanism can fulfill the motion requirement of the attachment point of the bicep 
spring. Although an inversion of a RPRR slider-crank mechanism comprising a hypocycloid gear 
can produce a pure straight line sinusoidal motion as well, the mechanism is, however, more 
difficult for the adjustment of length p.  
74 
e.g. adjusting lengths v or u, the parallelogram linkage can provide a different vertical force. To the 
proposed posterior linkage, two springs can be arranged in each of the parallelogram linkages, and 
gravity compensation of the superior-inferior motion can be achieved.

5.3.4 Adjustment of spring attachment points for the partial balance of gravity effect 
As a patient gradually recovers from the rehabilitating therapy, the upper limb of the patient gains 
more strength and requires less aid from the exoskeleton. Thus, at this stage, the exoskeleton only 
has to provide a percentage of gravity compensation due to the weight of the upper limb. If, say, β 
(0 ≦ β≦ 1) times of the gravity effect is to be balanced by the exoskeleton, the shoulder and 
elbow joints of a patient only have to fight against the remained (1- β) times of the gravity effect. 
This is equivalent to the weights of the upper arm and the forearm been reduced to (1- β) times of 
its original weights. Thus, the lumped masses of the upper arm and the forearm are, respectively, 
3
ˆ
u um m m   (5.25) 
4
ˆ
f fm m m   (5.26) 
where m3 and m4 is the masses of the exoskeleton links 3 and 4, and mu and mf is the masses of the 
subject’s upper arm and forearm respectively. For the case of β = 1, the spring forces balance both 
weights of the exoskeleton and the upper limb, while, for the case of β = 0, the spring forces 
balance only the weight of the exoskeleton and contribute neither assistance nor resistance to the 
GH and the HU joints of the upper limb. Hence, in order for the exoskeleton to balance β times of 
the gravity effect due to the weight of the upper limb, the gravitational potential energy of the 
system can be obtained by simply substituting the upper arm and the forearm masses with Eqs. 
(5.25) and (5.26) in the design equations. Hence, Eqs. (5.14) and (5.18) are modified to

vertical translation of the GH center about 90 mm. Note that the upper arm and the forearm are 
rested in nearly vertical at the initial configuration. Since the dynamic effect and the muscular 
compliance force are assumed negligible, static-mode simulation is utilized. The simulations are 
performed for the two levels of gravity balance, i.e., β equals to 0 and 1. Figures 5.9(a) and 5.9(b) 
plot the joint torques of the upper limb versus the angle of elevation for both simulations where the 
dash-dotted curve, the dashed curve, the dotted curve and the solid curve represent the magnitudes 
of torques of the elevation, the roll, elbow flexion and the vertical force on the GH center, 
respectively. In Fig. 5.9(a), unbalanced torques of an average of less than 10% of the balanced 
torques are due to the neglected gravity effects of the auxiliary links 5 and 6. Approximately, 40N of 
maximum vertical force on the GH center is reduced, and it is believed that the movement of the 
shoulder girdle incorporated with the elevation can be facilitated as the vertical force on the scapula 
is compensated.

5.5 Prototyping 
A first demonstration prototype of the exoskeleton was fabricated at the National Taiwan 
University and is as shown in Fig. 5.10(a). The base of the posterior linkage of the prototype is 
mounted rigidly on an extruded aluminum frame and the arm linkage is attached to the user’s limb 
with two leather straps on the upper arm and the forearm respectively. The links of the exoskeleton 
are made of aluminum alloys and the total weight of the device is approximately 3.5 Kgf. The 
springs used are all commercially purchasable non-zero-free-length springs. By matching the initial 
78 
the aforementioned problems. The posterior linkage of the second-version is of a single 
parallelogram linkage. With adding a revolute joint about a vertical axis at the base as the 
compensation DOF to the double-parallelogram design, the posterior linkage still can achieve the 
anterior-posterior motion, the inferior-superior motions, and yet, the gravity balance. An additional 
pair of leather straps is attached to the upper arm and the forearm. Springs k1 and k2 are replaced by 
custom-made springs, with smaller spring constants, and the weights of the springs can be further 
taken into account by an optimization method to improve the accuracy of gravity balance [42]. 
 
5.6 Preliminary testing on the ROM 
A preliminary testing of the second prototype was performed to analyze the kinematic 
compatibility of the device, with the data extracted from the experiment of a male subject of statue 
height 1.81 m. In the experimental protocol, the subject was asked to perform the predetermined 
movements: several ADL motions and random motion of the arm in the total available workspace. 
The experimental protocol was executed, first with the exoskeleton dressed on and then repeated 
without the exoskeleton. Optical markers were attached to the upper limb and the device directly, 
and the positioning coordinates of each marker were acquired from the motion capture system 
VICON. As shown in Figs. 5.10(b) and 5.11(a), optical markers J1 and J2 were placed on the distal 
ends of the ulna and the radius respectively to interpolate the position of the wrist center point J, 
and marker O was placed at the sternal notch of the subject. The major goal of the experiment is to 
show the differences, of maximum reachable workspace by the wrist point, between the 
‘exoskeleton-on’ and the ‘exoskeleton-off’.  
The position points of the wrist center J relative to origin marker O were imported to the 
software MATLAB for post-processing: the Delaunay triangulation is processed based on the set of 
acquired data points, and then the tetrahedral meshed workspaces can be generated as shown in Fig. 
5.11 where the light-colored and the dark-colored regions represent the reachable workspaces by the 
wrist point with and without the exoskeleton respectively. The volumes of the meshed workspaces 
are calculated, respectively, (5.76×10
-1
) m
3
 and (6.92×10
-1
) m
3
 for the exoskeleton-on and the 
exoskeleton-off. The initial testing of the ROM of the second-version prototype seems promising; 
an approximate 83% of reachable workspace can be achieved. Observed from Fig. 5.11, the ROM, 
when the exoskeleton is dressed on, is primarily limited at the right-posterior (i.e. the [－, －, +] 
octant in XYZ) and the left-inferior (i.e. the [+, +, －] octant in XYZ) regions of the subject. The two 
restrictions are on the two opposite sides in space and involve a design tradeoff counting on the link 
dimensions of the posterior linkage: the arm interferes with the posterior linkage at the 
right-posterior region, and to minify such interference the size of the posterior linkage have to be 
small. While, reaching the upper limb toward the left-inferior region requires a lengthened posterior 
linkage that can provide a larger workspace for the scapular link.

linear spring elements. By adjusting the spring attachment points to other locations, the exoskeleton 
can be adjusted to reduce the gravity torques on both the shoulder and elbow joints by a 
predetermined amount of reduction ranged from 0% to 100%, depending on the evaluated progress 
of the movement ability of the upper limb. A model consisting of the exoskeleton and the upper 
limb built in ADAMS has demonstrated the success of the design for the movement of the upper 
limb during a combing hair motion, and a demonstration prototype was fabricated to verify the 
proposed design. This paper offers an alternative kinematics and spring balancing methodology in 
designing an upper limb exoskeleton. Since the balancing function of the device considers the 
superior-inferior motion of the GH joint center, the design can benefit from the more 
comfortableness on the movements of shoulder girdle. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Static balancing of a mechanism or a robot has a long history of investigation by researchers and 
engineers. It has almost become a classic problem that can be learned and answered from the text 
books. Followed by the technology trend, electronic devices become cheaper and more feasible and 
thus enable the control method for static balancing to implement easily on most of the robotic 
systems. However, electronic devices can be sometimes unreliable. The best control of a mechanical 
system is the inherited geometric constraints of the mechanism itself. Such a mechanical system 
with high passivity may be referred to as an adaptive mechanism: a mechanism with the ability to 
adapt and respond to the changing stimulations from an environment. As the Passive Dynamic 
Walker (PDW) [70] by the Cornell University, the PDW has no actuation and control system and 
can perform a similar human walking locomotion with only the aid of gravity and spring devices. A 
kinetic artist Theo Jansen designs several skeletal mechanisms, which he called the ‘strandbeest’ 
[71], that vividly stroll on a beach like animals in herds with only the wind power coming from the 
sea. An adaptive mechanical system demands less energy and is deemed more environmental 
protective. It may the better interface that we human to interact with the Mother Nature in the 
future. 
The idea of adaptive mechanism is highlighted, and the spring balancing mechanism is a 
conservative and adaptive system. This Dissertation develops several general design schemes that 
can deal with the spring balancing of many types of mechanical systems: one-DOF planar 
closed-loop mechanisms, multi-DOF planar open-loop mechanisms, and serial-type planar linkages. 
Efforts have been made through the investigations to the better understanding of the physical 
significance behind a spring balancing mechanism. As an outcome, alternative designs that are new 
can be obtained more easily, systematically and efficiently. Potentially, inventions and novel 
applications may be contributed to our society. 
Static balancing with the counterweight method is almost thoroughly investigated over the years 
for most of the existing mechanical systems. In comparison, the spring balancing is a relatively new 
technique and its development seemly falls behind. Until recently, advantageous applications of 
82 
6. The characteristic of one of the auxiliary link method is identified, that is, the pseudo-base 
must be moving parallel to the gravitational direction. 
An upper limb exoskeleton as an application of spring balancing articulated mechanism is 
proposed, it is to facilitate and assist patients with muscular weakness practicing ADL, and the 
proposed device is prototyped and tested preliminarily.

技術說明 
一種上肢穿戴式重力平衡機械臂，可提供相應之作用力來抵抗上
之所受重力，以讓中風患者能自由移動上肢。本上肢穿戴式重力
平衡機械臂利用彈簧平衡機構之重力平衡概念，完整地平衡使用
者在任意上肢姿勢下之上肢重量，幫助肌肉麻痺等患者進行復健
運動訓練。外甲結構(exoskeleton)在穿戴時滿足肩盤(shoulder 
girdle)三個平移自由度、肩部三個旋轉自由度及肘部一個旋轉自
由度。該機械手臂因不含驅動元件較為安全及低成本，其重力平
衡利用兩條彈簧達成，彈簧連結構型上亦有仿生概念類似上肢二
頭肌及三頭肌，根據彈簧安裝的位置不同，可完全平衡或部分平
衡關節所受之力矩，藉此根據復健情形的不同做調整。機械臂具
有可調整的桿件長度以配合不同穿戴者的身材。概念原型機已完
成並驗證所謂完美被動平衡之概念，經實驗量測可滿足 83％上肢
最大可觸空間，可提供大部分上肢日常生活（activity of daily 
living）所需之自由度。 
An upper limb exoskeleton with passive gravity compensation 
provides an equivalently gravity-reduced environment for stroke 
patients to conduct the upper limb movements at their will. The upper 
limb exoskeleton is based on the concept of gravity balance of 
spring-balancing mechanism, which is able to compensate the 
gravitational force of upper limbs of users, and help stroke patients 
doing training of rehabilitation. With the special arrangement of the 
installed spring elements, the exoskeleton is capable of providing the 
full or partial balance of the joint torques due to the weight of the 
upper arm and forearm, depending on the therapeutic needs of the 
rehabilitation, and the link lengths of the exoskeleton are adjustable 
for patients wearing. A proof-of-concept prototype of the exoskeleton 
device is built and verifies the concept of the ideal, perfect and static 
balance.

本次會議的活動從11/03 (Thu) 上海交通大學機械系TAKATA國際會議廳專題演講揭
開序幕，分別由中國第一重工(CFIH, China First Heavy Industries)總裁Dr. Ke Ma以“The 
Product Design of Modern Heavy-duty Machine”及香港科技大學 Professor Zexiang Li以 
“From Da Vinci to Five Axes Machines”發表專題演講。前者研究強調中國企業與大學間合
作研究成果；後者則強調創新機構概念構想及數學模型的建立與解析，非常有啟發性與深
度。 
個人所發表之論文是發表於本系列會議中第一天(11/03) Parallel Session I，此部分會議
共有10 篇研究論文，個人論文於 PM15:20~15:40 做口頭報告，會議廳內大約有20 人左
右，報告過程尚稱順利，時間也有控制在15 分鐘左右。報告結束後Q & A時有3 個人發問
有關論文所研究的機構的特性？肌肉訓練阻力如何產生？不同的阻力如何調整？在台灣
訓練與復健機構輔具研究現況？於發問的當下即時給予適當的回覆，Q&A過程具有建設
性，互動良好並能獲得其他學者的回應。 
由於第一天即完成論文口頭報告，第二天得以輕鬆的心情，利用此難得的機會，參加
會議中讓我感興趣的領域與題目，提出問題並與發表學者間互動。了解其他國家學者研究
主題聚焦，學習其他與會學者的研究方法與結果分析，並同時觀摩其英文口頭報告表達方
式。其中東京大學(University of Tokyo)的研究  “Fast Inverse Dynamic Algorithm with 
Decomposed Computation of Gradient for Wire-Driven Multi-Body Systems and its Application 
to Estimation of Human Muscle Tensions” 及 “A Exoskeleton Hydrostatic Power-Assisting 
Mechanism and its Pressure Feedback Control Based on Singular Perturbation Method” 對個人
研究領域非常具有參考價值。東京工業大學(Tokyo Institute of Technology) Yukio Takada發
表的 “Kinematic Synthesis of Two-DOF Rotational Parallel Mechanism with Compensation for 
Position Error”亦讓我看到日本學術研究在先進產業技術研究應用的連結與深度。 
二. 與會心得 
這次參與國際研討會個人受益良多，有了先前幾次參與國際學術會議的經驗後，此次
更能與與會學者交流互動。

exoskeleton. 
四. 建議: 
不同於投稿國際學術期刊，投稿國際知名研討會與口頭報告增加了同儕間面對面的即
時分享與互動，猶如相同研究社群間的聚會，並讓研究工作能提前接受他人評價；另外，
讓相關領域的研究者齊聚一堂，交換研究資訊與心得，擴大研究領域視野與人脈，雖未如
期刊有SCI等參考指標，仍值得鼓勵參與。 
鼓勵或經費上贊助博士班學生出國參加會議，對於博士班學生參與國際研討會的訓練
與養成是非常必要的，且對於國內學術研究的國際化交流應該有非常正面的幫助。因此，
希望國家相關學術教育單位能繼續支持、贊助博士班學生參與國內外知名學術研討會發表
研究論文，以激發並提升國內學術研究風氣、品質及台灣的國際學術地位。 
五. 攜回資料名稱及內容:

創新型中小企業的產業集群及國際化趨勢；第二篇同樣以專利資訊為研究樣
本，透過社會網絡分析，探析高影響力科技型企業在產業技術發展中的特點
及位置。5/23 上午先出席兩位學者的 Keynote Speech 演講，因而對於如何提
升高等教育系統競爭力獲益良多；隔日中午則是針對兩篇論文進行發表，同
時亦加入同場次的其他發表者的論文討論，題目包括“Factors Affecting SMEs 
Strategic Choices(Case of Finnish machine industry SMEs) ”, “Institutional 
Support System for the Development of SME Innovation (the authors’ own 
research)” , “The SME Needs in the Area of Innovation Progress” , “Building 
Information Modeling as a new business trend in construction industry” , 
“Conception of information systems implementation time break even point in 
SMEs” , “The Development of Suan sunandaha Rajabhat University Electronic 
Journal System”等 6 篇管理相關論文等，與有同樣研究興趣的他校學者交流
獲益良多。在議程中積極參與來自不同國家各領域學者的論文發表與討論，
並相互評估後續學術研究合作的可行性，進一步消除雙方在研究發展上的隔
閡。 
二、與會心得 
參與此國際會議獲得許多寶貴經驗與分享學術的機會，除了將本人在專
利計量學與工程產業專利分析的研究成果，擴散至國際研究者群，另外也獲
悉他國相關領域學者們的最新研究動態，有助於各方學者共擬未來研究方向
及趨勢，並擴大學術社群網絡的相互連結。此外，本次會議許多與會學者來
自歐洲各國，顯見歐洲各國對於技術創新和科技管理議題極為重視且成果豐
碩，然歐洲學者為臺灣研究者較少接觸的學術社群，若可進一步與之商討未
來的合作計畫，可望同時強化學科領域的發展進程，加速知識的翻新，拓展
此學術研究的發展性，累積理論與實務的經驗，亦能推動本校國際化的程

完美對應不同構型下機構由重力所造成不同之靜力矩。本研究計畫發展出一套表示方法:
剛性方塊矩陣（stiffness block matrix）、機構構型方塊矩陣( configuration block 
matrix )及彈簧-桿件鄰接矩陣（spring configuration matrix）。提出平面單自由度、
平面多自由度、空間多自由度之彈簧平衡機構設計方法，該設計方法能決定可行彈簧平衡
機構內彈簧與桿件間的鄰接關係、彈簧端點在該連結桿件上之位置、彈簧彈性參數及最少
所需彈簧數目，亦提供了設計準則使彈簧平衡機構設計更有效率。 
另提出彈簧平衡機構之一創新應用：上肢穿戴式重力平衡機械臂。此機械臂利用彈簧平衡
機構之重力平衡概念，可完整地平衡使用者在任意上肢姿勢下之上肢重量，其重力平衡利
用兩條彈簧達成，彈簧連結構型上類似上肢二頭肌及三頭肌，概念原型機已完成並驗證所
謂完美被動平衡之概念，可提供大部分上肢日常生活所需之自由度。 
本研究成果於學理上有重大突破，跳脫前人相關研究障礙，研究出彈簧平衡機構安裝彈簧
位置之準則，並提出實際之應用。在計畫執行過程中，可培養參與本計劃相關執行人員在
機構運動分析、能量模型之建立、實體機構的設計、組裝、實驗與量測、實驗數據的分析
和比對等能力，使其成為在機械與機構設計領域中之專業人才。
