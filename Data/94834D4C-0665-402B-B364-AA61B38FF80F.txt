我們之前發表了一套全新的經顱磁刺激術。這套新方法是依據海馬廻的 theta
叢集模式所演化而來，所以就稱為 theta 叢集刺激（ＴＢＳ）。利用不同的刺刺

在清醒的人類大腦皮質產生安全､可控制､持續､長效而有力的長效抑制 (LTD) 
或是長效提昇 (LTP)。這些效應可以表現在神經電生理的檢測和行為模式上。
很特別的是，我們發現ＴＢＳ的刺激模式（連續性或是間歇性）是決定突觸效

要探討這個特別的現象，並建立數學模型來印證。 
 
在這兩年的研究中，我首先印證一個叢集在 150 亳秒處抑制 SICI 是基於一

from experiments in this study and previous studies to construct a mathematical 
model of TBS. With the help of the model, we may develop new TBS that is even 
more efficient, powerful, and reliable. 
 
文獻探討 
 
Repeated electrical stimulation of neural circuits in the brains of animal 
preparations can alter the efficiency of synaptic transmission and lead it to 
long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), which are very closely 
linked to the functional cortical reorganisation (Hess and Donoghue 1994). 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a technique for non-invasive stimulation 
of the human brain, led the expectation to produce the similar effect in conscious 
human beings (Muellbacher, Ziemann et al. 2000; Siebner and Rothwell 2003). 
Reorganisation occurs in the human brain in response to injury or disease (Kaas, 
Merzenich et al. 1983; Flor, Elbert et al. 1995; Buchkremer-Ratzmann, August et al. 
1996; Nelles, Spiekermann et al. 1999; Huse, Larbig et al. 2001; Karl, Birbaumer et 
al. 2001), and it would be of considerable benefit to have an effective tool with 
which to enhance these changes where they are beneficial (e.g. in the recovery of 
the motor system after stroke) or to suppress them where they are maladaptive (e.g. 
in the phantom limb syndrome). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
has potential as such a tool to have therapeutic effects on neurological (Siebner, 
Mentschel et al. 1999; Shimamoto, Takasaki et al. 2001; Gilio, Curra et al. 2002; 
Huang, Edwards et al. 2004) and psychological (Speer, Kimbrell et al. 2000; 
Daskalakis, Christensen et al. 2002; Martin, Barbanoj et al. 2002) diseases. 
Although many cellular and molecular mechanisms have been investigated to 
elucidate the LTP/LTD effects (Larson and Lynch 1988; Hirsch and Crepel 1991; 
Hirsch and Crepel 1992; Randic, Jiang et al. 1993; Aroniadou and Keller 1995; Barr, 
Lambert et al. 1995; Kaila, Lamsa et al. 1997; Vickery, Morris et al. 1997; Otani, 
Blond et al. 1998; Otani and Connor 1998; Speer, Kimbrell et al. 2000; Caria, Melis 
et al. 2001; Patenaude, Chapman et al. 2003; Yasuda, Higashi et al. 2003), the 
protocols of repetitive stimulation, electrical or magnetic, for plasticity-induction 
have rarely been discussed. The most commonly accepted theory, which people 
strongly propose, is that the frequency decides the direction of the plasticity which 
is induced (Valls-Sole, Pascual-Leone et al. 1992; Valzania, Quatrale et al. 1994) .

condition will be repeated. 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
Magnetic stimulation was given using a hand-held figure of eight coil with an 
outer winding diameter of 70 mm (Magstim Co., Whitland, Dyfed, UK) connected 
to Bistim2 machines (Magstim Co., UK) or one Magstim Rapid2 Package (Magstim 
Co., UK). The coil was placed tangentially to the scalp with the handle pointing 
backwards, which is thought to preferentially activate the corticospinal cells 
trans-synaptically (Kaneko et al., 1996). The optimal location of the coil was 
determined by the location on the scalp where magnetic stimulation produced the 
largest MEP from the contralateral FDI when the subject was relaxed (the “motor 
hot-spot”). According the guidelines of the International Federation of Clinical 
Neurophysiology (Rothwell et al., 1999), we defined the resting motor threshold 
(RMT) as the minimum stimulation intensity over the motor hot-spot that could 
elicit an MEP of no less than 50uV in five out of ten trials. The active motor 
threshold (AMT) The AMT was defined as the minimum single pulse intensity 
required to produce an MEP of greater than 200uV on more than five out of ten 
trials from the contralateral FDI while the subject was maintaining a voluntary 
contraction of about 20% of maximum using visual feedback. 
The peak-to-peak amplitude of MEPs evoked by a suprathreshold stimulus and 
short intracortical inhibition (SICI) were used to probe the excitability of the motor 
cortex. I chose 2 ms as the interstimulus interval (ISI) to evaluate the SICI, which 
was first described by Kujirai et al (Kujirai et al., 1993). The intensity of the 
conditioning (first) stimulus will be set to 80% of AMT. The test (second) stimulus 
was set at an intensity that would evoke an EMG response of around 1 mV 
peak-to-peak amplitude, when given alone. Subjects received in a random order 
either the test stimulus alone, or conditioning-test stimuli. 
I. Confirming opposite effects induced by a short burst of TMS 
Originally, we planned to deliver a 50 Hz 3-pulse burst of TMS at different 
intensities to test MEP amplitude and SICI will be assessed at different time points 
do the bursts. However, due to a delay of the combining module that we ordered to 
combine Magstim 2002 and Rapid2, we could not perform this experiment. To solve 
this problem, we changed the protocol. The original idea was to test whether a bust 
at intensities higher than 80% AMT could produce effects similar to those of a 
single pulse at overthreshold intensity. According to this delay, we could not help 
but to reverse the hypothesis and test whether a single pulse at an intensity slightly

In the stage B, I proposed that the Ca2+ influx lead to production of a 
“facilitatory” or an “inhibitory” substance designed to be equivalent to activation of 
different types of protein kinases. In the model, I decided how the “facilitation” and 
“inhibitory” substances accumulate from the stage A. 
In the last stage of the model, these substances interacted with a process that 
lead to long term changes in synaptic effectiveness. These were equivalent to 
phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of AMPA receptor proteins giving rise to 
LTP and LTD respectively. The effects built up over minutes after the end of TBS. 
They were designed to build up and decay with a sigmoidal profile.

Parameters for modeling Ca2+ changes and for cascades of substances for 
LTP or LTD were based on the results of the experiments in the first session of this 
study, our previous report and the pilot study. Parameters for modeling the effect 
after TBS mainly depended on the second part of this study and our previous 
experiments of TBS. The model was created under MATLAB (The MathWorks, 
USA).

Fig 1 The effect of a pulse at different intensities on the amplitude of MEP, SICI and 
ICF at 150 ms after. A, The amplitude of MEP was suppressed by a 
conditioning pulse at 110%, but not 90% or 80%, RMT. B, SICI was reduced 
by a pulse, even when it did not change the test MEP size. C, ICF was not 
significantly modified by a conditioning pulse. 
 
A suprathrehold pulse reduced SICI at the interval where LICI was produced 
(Sanger et al., 2001). In this study, a pulse at 110% RMT inhibited the MEP through 
LICI at 150ms after the pulse. I then reduced the intensity of the pulse to 90% RMT, 
which showed no effect on the amplitude of MEP, the SICI was still decreased at 
150ms after the pulse. When I turned the intensity of the pulse further down to 80% 
RMT, the decrease in SICI disappeared. These data indicate that a subthreshold 
pulse can reduce SICI at the period where LICI takes place without changing the 
amplitude of MEP. There could be two possibilities. One is that MEP and SICI were 
suppressed by the same circuit (e.g.. LICI) as suggested by Sanger et al (2001), but

III. The mathematical model of TBS 
Parameters for modelling Ca2+ changes 
First of all, we set C as 1. Because a 3-pulse burst at 50 Hz takes around 40 ms 
and a burst was given every 200 ms, the t for calculating the decayed effect at the 
time when the next burst comes is 0.16 seconds. We set the decay constant k to be 
1.2. This value is somewhat arbitrary since the model is relatively insensitive to 
values of k within a very large range. 
Parameters for cascades of substances for LTP or LTD 
The facilitatory “substance” was modelled as accumulating proportional to the 
rate of the increase of Ca2+. The proportionality constant was set to 1. The exact 
value of this is again arbitrary since the overall effect of the model depends on the 
ratio between this value and that for the inhibitory “substance”. The latter was 
modelled as being related to the steady level of Ca2+ level with a proportionality 
constant of 0.07. These two constants for facilitation and inhibition ensured that 
after 5 single train of 5s TBS, the amount of each “substance” would be 
approximately equal. Both substances decayed exponentially between bursts with 
the inhibitory substance decaying more slowly than the facilitatory substance (time 
constants of 0.8 and 1.0 respectively).

Fig Results of a simple model that accounts for the different long lasting effects of 
cTBS, imTBS and iTBS. The model has three stages, represented by the three rows of 
graphs. In the first stage TBS causes an increase in the postsynaptic concentration of 
Ca2+. With cTBS (light gray shading), Ca2+ rises rapidly to a peak and then remains 
at that level until the end of the conditioning (40s). With iTBS (dark gray) and imTBS 
(gray), the Ca2+ initially rises in the same way but then declines exponentially at the 
end of each train (i.e. after every 2 s train for iTBS, and after every 5s train of 
imTBS). In the second stage, the Ca2+ interacts with a second process that produces 
facilitatory and inhibitory “substances”. These could be, for example, different levels 
of protein kinases in the postsynaptic neurone. The facilitatory “substance” rises at a 
rate proportional to the rate of increase in Ca2+, whereas the inhibitory “substance” 
rises more slowly proportional to the level of Ca2+. Thus during cTBS (rightmost 
graph), the initial rapid rise in Ca2+ causes a rapid increase in the facilitatory 
“substance” (red line), but this remains constant thereafter. The sustained increase in 
Ca2+ during cTBS causes a slower rising but larger increase in the amount of the 
inhibitory “substance” (blue line). With iTBS (leftmost graph), the rapid increases in 
Ca2+ at the start of each 2s train cause a greater production of facilitatory than 
inhibitory “substances”. With imTBS, the amount of each type of “substance” is 
equal. In the third stage (third row), the final level of the two “substances” interacts 
with two corresponding slower processes that may be analogous to 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of membrane bound ion channels responsible for 
production of LTP/LTD. They rise and fall with sigmoid time courses. Finally (bottom 
row), the net effect on MEP amplitudes is modelled as the sum of these positive and 
negative after effects. Following cTBS, suppression is larger than facilitation and the 
MEPs are suppressed for many minutes. The opposite occurs after iTBS, whilst after 
imTBS, suppression and facilitation are matched and there is virtually no net effect on
