英文摘要 
Investigation of correlation between noise spectrum and EMI on MESFET nanometer 
multi-quantum well LED 
 
It is known that Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) has a negative effect upon the 
performance of electronic communication systems. The present study considers the case where 
EMI is induced in a Conducting Wire (CW), and derives equations to establish the influence of 
the induced EMI on InGaN material of nanometer quantum well Light-Emitting Diodes (LED) 
and MESFET. These equations are then verified experimentally. Theoretical models of the noise 
spectra and the EMI are constructed. In general, a good agreement is identified between the 
experimental and theoretical results. Experimental and numerical results reveal that the 
magnitude of the EMI-induced noise is related to the pulse height, the output load, the parasitic 
capacitance, the interference frequency and the interference amplitude. It is shown that a higher 
interference amplitude or frequency increases the harmonic noise. Moreover, this thesis presents 
a complete measurement to obtain the interference noise and signal to noise ratio (SNR).

Abstract 
This study investigates the low-frequency noise induced by electromagnetic radiation interference (EMI) in a 
nanometer multi-quantum well InGaN LED (NMQLED). Theoretical models of the noise spectra and the EMI are 
constructed. In general, a good agreement is identified between the experimental and theoretical results. 
Experimental and numerical results reveal that the magnitude of the EMI-induced noise is related to the pulse height, 
the output load, the parasitic capacitance, the interference frequency and the interference amplitude. It is shown that a 
higher interference amplitude or frequency increases the harmonic noise. Moreover, this thesis presents a complete 
measurement to obtain the interference noise and signal to noise ratio (SNR).

I. Introduction 
 Nanometer technology [1-3] has attracted intensive research efforts in recent years [4-6] and will undoubtedly 
continue to do so in the coming decades. Industrial products are becoming smaller on a seemingly continuous basis. 
This trend is particularly evident in the information industry, in which the internal structures of semiconductor 
elements are typically less than 90 nm nowadays. Therefore, it is essential to develop a thorough understanding of 
the physical properties and principles which govern the nanometer technology field. Nanometer materials have many 
new physical and chemical properties which can be exploited to overcome the difficulties which we now face. For 
example, quantum rays have no resistance. Nanometer technology enables the realization of products which can 
operate with minimum energy losses and heating effects. Nano-tech products offer many other advantages, including 
(1) reduced material and space requirements, (2) reduced energy consumption during production and operation, such 
that they save energy and conform to environment protection and ecological conservation standards, (3) smaller 
structures with enhanced functionality, leading to increased activity and density, and (4) the generation of more 
indebted people  and less environmental destruction, hence supporting permanent human development. Nanometer 
technology is a clear case in which it can be argued: “the smaller the better”. However, when producing programs to 
achieve the nanometer gauge, many new quantum appearances  oblige scientists and researchers to recognize the 
existence of physical limits. Therefore, scientists have no choice but to look for new technologies and materials to 
overcome these limitations. The density and functionality of semiconductors is continuously promoted by technology 
advancement. Due to the swift advancement of micro-miniaturization techniques, producing programs are now 
approaching their limit. For example, the storage capacity of a DVD is now limited only by its optical diffraction 
limit. Therefore, it is necessary to extend the storage technology of far-field optics to the field of near-field optics, 
which combines a short wavelength with a high refractive medium, and to increase the numerical aperture value. In

measured power spectral intensity of the fundamental harmonic and then evaluates the power spectral intensities of the 
higher-order harmonics. 
2.2 Electromagnetic interference 
The interference source used in this study is in the form of a coil wound on a ferromagnetic toroid with an air gap. 
A conducting wire (CW) is positioned in the air gap to induce an EMI voltage of magnitude Veff. The following 
expressions can be derived for the magnetic field density and the flux density in the air gap [11]:

dvBHdvHP gggrB ∫∫ == 2121 20μ  (8) 
In Eqs. (7) and (8), μ0 is the permeability of free space, μ is the permeability of the ferromagnetic material, I0 is 
the current flowing within the coil, r0 is the mean radius of the toroid, lg is the width of the narrow air gap, and PrB is 
the magnetic energy in the air gap. The value of PrB represents the average energy per second of the interference on 
the CW, and can either be calculated from Eq. (8), or can be measured directly. 
The radiated power and the CW-induced interference voltage, Veff, can be written as [12,13]:

where c2 is a proportionality constant, β is the phase constant, L is the length of the dipole, ηis the intrinsic 
impedance of the medium, Im is the maximum induced current within the dipole, and R in is the input resistance. From 
Eq. (10), it can be shown that the magnitude of the induced interference is proportional to the interference frequency. 
The interference voltage induced in the device, and can be obtained directly by measurement as figure 1, Rin is the 
input resistance of the device, comprising the ohmic resistance of the coil (Rohmic) and the dynamic input resistance of 
the counter (Rinput), and Rr is the radiation resistance of the short dipole [12,13]. 
3. Results and Discussion 
The induced voltage is amplified by a factor of 2000 such that the signal can be obtained by an oscilloscope. 
Figure 3 presents the typical measured and simulated noise power spectral intensities of the DUT for an EMI of a 
square wave VP=1.6 V and a frequency of f=400 Hz. It is shown a good agreement with those predicted from the 
measurement and simulation. To further investigate the effect of the EMI on the noise spectrum, this study varied the 
amplitude of the AC interference signal with an offset voltage of VP between 0.2 V and 1.6 V. Some of the measured 
values are C=5.24x10-11 F, RL=43 Ω (LED on), and f=400 Hz. A proper value of a  equal to 6438 which we select to 
simulate the noise spectrum with referred figure 1. Initially, a measured data was selected to fit for obtaining the 
induced current, A, of the EMI of AC interference amplitude VP=1.6 V and f=400 HZ as figure 6. Figure 4 compares 
the experimental results obtained for the harmonic wave of the noise power spectral intensity with the simulation 
results obtained from Eq. (6) for a simulated current of fixed value A=774μA. The figure also compares the 
experimental and simulation results obtained for the other harmonic components in the noise spectrum for VP=0.2 V 
to 1.6 V and simulated values of A ranging from 774 μA to 88 μA. In all cases, the simulated results are in good
