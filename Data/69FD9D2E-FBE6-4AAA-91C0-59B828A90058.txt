(二) 計畫英文摘要: 
   Process capability indices (PCIs) have been proposed in the manufacturing industry to 
provide numerical measures on process reproduction capability, which are effective tools 
for quality assurance and guidance for process improvement. PCIs are calculated under 
the assumption that the process is stable (the process mean and variation are not change), 
but in practice, the process is dynamic. If  the process mean has a small shift, the control 
chart doesn’t detect obviously so that the PCIs will overestimate the true process 
capability. For this reason, the PCIs have to be adjusted. Bothe (2002) provided the 
adjustment method for normality processes. In this research, we consider Weibull 
processes which cover a wide class of  applications. We calculate adjustments under 
various sample sizes n and Weibull parameter, with power fixed to 0.5. Then, we 
calculate the mean shift adjustments and addresses this problem computing reliable 
estimates for capability index Cpk for Weibull processes when the statistically adjustments 
is considered. For illustration purpose, an application example is presented.

independent and identically distributed in Weibull (1,  )γ , and the mean of the observations is 
nX  ( 1 1
n
n i inX X== ∑ ). Lu (2003) found out the approximately distribution of nX  by computing 
three quantiles we are interested in. While iX is a random variable from Weibull (1,  )γ  for 
1,2, ,i n= " , with the transformation variable set as i iY X γ= , iY  will be a random variable from 
exponential distribution (λ=1). The distribution of nYYY +++ "21 is used to approximate the 
distribution of nXXX +++ "21 . Therefore, we want to figure out such )(tw  that will 
satisfy the following equation,

where 
 3 2 3( ) .w t at bt ctγ γ γ= + +  (6) 
As a result, since )(tw  contains three unknown parameters a, b, and c, we use three 
quantiles (0.1, 0.5 and 0.9) to calculate the values of a, b, and c. Let pt  and pθ  be the 
quantile of 1 2( )nX X X+ + +"  and )( 21 nYYY +++ " , respectively. Then we can observe the 
following equations 
 ptXXP pn =≤++ )( 1 " , (7)

Three quantiles are set as 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 in the equation 3 2p p p pat bt ct
γ γ γ θ+ + = , and 
then three linear equations will be obtained. From these linear equations, we obtain the 
values of a, b, c, and )(tw . Then the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of nX  
distribution can be calculated. The procedure for calculating the c.d.f. of nX  distribution is 
developed by Lu (2003) as follows: 
STEP 1: When iY  is a random variable from exponential (λ=1) for 1,2, ,i n= " , we 
can use the property of the poisson distribution to find the equation as:

The sorted variables are )()2()1( ,,, NSSS … , where )*(ˆ pNp St =  and = 0.1,  0.5, and 0.9p . For

nX   are Weibull distributed.  
Tables 1 and 2 show the detection power with the right process mean shift (k>0) and the 
left process mean shift (k<0) when 1X , 2X ,….., nX  are distributed as Weibull ( , )α γ  with 
1 and 1 (1) 10α γ= = . The magnitude of shift in the second column on the left are Bothe’s 
capability adjustments determined when data comes from normal process and the detection 
power is 0.5. We can find out that, under Bothe’s capability adjustments, the detection 
power is less than 0.5 when 1γ =  and 2 in Table 2, and 5γ ≥  in Table 2. The results 
indicate that the Bothe’s adjustments are inadequate when the process is Weibull distributed. 
This is because that Bothe’s approach (2002) is based on the normality assumption of the 
data and the detection power is 0.5. In Table 1 and Table 2, the detection power is more than 
0.5 when 3γ =  and 4, which means that Weibull distribution is closer to normal 
distribution when 3γ =  and 4. As the value of γ  is in the region of [3, 4], the form of 
Weibull distribution becomes centralizing. However, the detection power is poorer and far 
less than 0.5 when data coming from Weibull process is skewed. For example, when 1γ =  
and the subgroup size 2=n , the detection power is 0.054. It implies that Bothe’s 
adjustments are inadequate when the process is Weibull distributed. Consequently, in our 
study, we determine the capability adjustment when process data comes from Weibull 
process.

3. Undetected Mean Shift under Designated Power 
It was observed in the preceding section that the detection power is less than 0.5 when 
1γ = , 2 with the right mean shift (k>0), while 5γ ≥ with the left mean shift (k<0) under 
Bothe’s adjustments. Since the small mean shift can not be detected by the control chart, we 
have no idea whether the mean is the right shift or the left shift.  For this reason, we discuss 
the cases of  some specific γ  and k values with the poorer performance of  detection power 
presented in Table 1 and Table 2. Hence, the capability adjustments are determined for the 
specific values of  1γ = (1)3 with the right mean shift (k>0), while 4(1)10γ =  with the left 
mean shift (k<0) based on designated detection power is 0.5. In this section, a program is 
developed to determine the adjustment. The program contains the procedure for calculating 
the c.d.f. of  nX  distribution developed by Lu (2003) and the desired detection power is set 
to be 0.5, the Weibull parameter γ  and the subgroup size n. Therefore, for users’ 
convenience in applying our proposed procedure, we tabulate the values of  undetected mean 
shift adjustment, 50AS , in Table 3. The value of 50AS  is the magnitude of  shift we need to 
adjust based on the designated detection power to be 0.5. And the process data comes from 
Weibull (1,  γ ) with the values of  γ  and k ( 1γ = (1)3 with k>0, and 4(1)10γ =  k<0) and n = 
2(1)15. For example, if  we set γ  = 3 and n = 5, the adjustment is 50AS  = 1.301. We 
conclude that the 50AS σ⋅  (= 1.301σ ) is required based on the designated detection power 
to be 0.5 when data comes from Weibull (1,3). Also, in Table 3, when γ  is small

The estimate of  index ′npkC  will decrease and the expected total number of  nonconforming 
parts will increase with the adjustment σ50AS in this assessment. In addition, we 
implemented the derived results to develop an effective procedure below for calculating 
production yield accurately. Practitioners can use the proposed procedure to determine 
whether their process meets the preset capability requirement and make reliable decisions to 
the process  
An Procedure for Calculating Weibull Production Yield with Mean shift 
STEP 1. Given the sample size n , and parameters α  and γ  estimated by the maximum 
likelihood estimate (MLE) technique, then we obtain the mean shift adjustment, 
50AS , by checking Table 3.  
STEP 2. Calculate the three quantiles 0.00135F , 0.5F  , and 0.99865F  for σ =

to assess the production yield. 
5. Application 
The PCB (Printed Circuit Board) manufacturing process mainly consists of a series of 
chemical related operations and the chemical operations determine the functions of the PCB. 
Figure 1 shows that PCBs typically start out as thin sheets of fiberglass (about 1mm thick) 
that are completely covered on both sides with very thin sheets of metal (typically copper). A 
"standard" circuit board might use a 1 ounce copper process, which means that one ounce of 
copper is evenly spread across 1 square foot of circuit board. During the manufacturing 
process, wire patterns are "printed" onto the copper surfaces using a compound that resists 
etching (hence the name Printed Circuit Board or PCB). The boards are subjected to a 
chemical etching process that removes all exposed copper. The makers have to create 
patterns required on the laminate. For multi-layer PCBs, the patterns will include inner layer 
and outer layer. The PCBs pass through a chain of inner layer pattern coating, mass 
lamination press, and drilling, outer layer pattern creation, solder resist coating. The 
high-density PCBs have to progress faster. The electronic device packaging shrinking size 
changes as the bonding pad design on PCB  (see Figure 2). The exact solder become more 
and more important.

calculated by a traditional capability study (the shift of  process mean is not considered). We 
can find out that the value of  the modified pkC is much smaller. This result indicates that 
the unadjusted Cpk would overestimate the actual process yield when the process mean shifts 
are not detected. Since those shifts are not detected, the practitioner would be able to keep its 
quality promise for this process. Our adjustments take those shifts into account. When the 
adjusted process capability drops below the desired quality level, the practitioner should stop 
the process because the process does not meet his preset capability requirement. 
As the subgroup size n increases, the shift in process mean has a higher probability of  
detection. For example, if  n=15, the 50AS  would be 0.788 for Weibull distribution ( γˆ =5 
and αˆ =2.5) from Table 3, and then the ′npkC  index is

Enlarging n from 10 to 15 increases the ′npkC  index from 0.793 to 0.851, and the total 
number of  production yield would be increased. 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper, we consider how to determine the undetected process mean shifts for 
adjusting the formula of  process capability when data follows the Weibull distribution. We 
first examined Bothe’s approach and calculated the detection power, which is less than 0.5, 
when data comes from the Weibull process. The result showed that Bothe’s adjustments are 
inadequate when the process is Weibull distributed. In the Weibull processes, we calculated 
the adjustments for various sample sizes (n) and the Weibull parameter ( γ ) with the 
detection power fixed to 0.5. For the small value of  γ  when the distribution is skewed, the 
required adjustment in the capability index formula is much greater than those for normal 
processes. Using the proposed procedure to determine adjusted process capability, 
practitioners can determine the actual process capability more accurately. As a conclusion, 
the production yield estimation would be much more accurate.
