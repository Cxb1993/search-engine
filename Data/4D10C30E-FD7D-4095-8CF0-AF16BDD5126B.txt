B. Description of Neural System and Prediction 
Control 
The proposed neural dynamics, being the nonlinear plant 
with input-delay and state-delay under the prediction 
control input , are assumed to be represented as the 
open-loop neural system:

where  is the output of the indirect neurons. Firstly, 
we define the reference input , with  being its 
-th derivative, the tracking error as 
, , 
 and . Suppose that we 
choose a gain vector such that all 
roots of  are in the open 
left-half complex plane. Now, let the proposed ideal

explicitly included. Next, we use these two auto-tuning

Step 4: As several comparisons are shown in Fig.3-Fig.7, 
which about the contribution of supervisory controller 
and compensator to this control system with the 
modeling errors, external disturbance, state delay and 
input delay, the output responses by using proposed 
adaptive predictive control method and other case’s 
methods as follows. To clear the causes of results, we 
design the following Case 1 – Case 4 which doesn’t 
consider the external disturbance. 
Case 1: The proposed method without the compensator 
for the nonlinear control system that without 
external disturbance in this paper, and we set 
021.022 == ττ d , 1.111 == ττ d . 
Case 2: Case 1 without supervisory controller in this 
paper.  
Case 3: The fuzzy controller without supervisory 
controller for the nonlinear control system 
without external disturbance [22][23]. 
Case 4: Case 3 with supervisory controller [22][23]. 
Step 5: As a comparison are shown in Fig.3 and Fig.7, 
which about the contribution of the green power scheme 
to this control system with the external disturbance, the 
output responses by using proposed adaptive predictive 
control method. 
Case 5: Case 1 with the compensator for the nonlinear 
control system with external disturbance in this 
paper, and we set 008.022 == ττ d , 
1.111 == ττ d , 10=κ . 
From the computer simulations, the external 
disturbance, model errors, state delays, and input delay 
may yield worst tracking performance, but our method 
may let the control system be more robustness and lower 
power consumption in attenuating the effects of the 
combined disturbance, modeling errors and delays. It is 
clear that better performance can be achieved than Case 
2 – Case 4. The corresponding tuning trajectories of fθ  
and gθ  used in our proposed method are also shown in 
Fig.3 and Fig.7. In simulation, if 
EdttytyE tt ddd ≤−= ∫ 21 221 |)(),(|)( ττ  is satisfied, 
then the maximum input-delay time 2dτ  exists in E ’s 
condition, and the maximum input delay time 
021.02 =dτ sec is decided by this condition to illustrate 
the proposed theorems that are the input-delay dependent 
criterions in this paper. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
The main purpose of this paper is to study the 
supervised indirect neural adaptive predictive control 
strategy in the tracking problem of nonliear system to 
reduce the input-delay and state-delay effects on tracking 
accuracy. Delay exists in feedback state and 
delay-independent stability for this system, which is 
investigated. A design methodology for stabilization and 
robustness of this kind of input-delay and state-delay 
nonlinear system is presented. The design procedure is 
conceptually simple and natural. Moreover, the stability 
analysis and control design problems can be solved very 
efficiently in practice by projection techniques and 
adaptation laws. Simulation results show that the 
supervised adaptive indirect neural predictive control 
approach is both effective and relatively easy to apply.
