Background
In practice, the assessment of the skeletal age (SA or bone age BA) is of great use in the
paediatric radiology. It is developed for paediatrician to evaluate patients' growth disorder, to
determine their growth potential, and to monitor the therapy effects of growth, e.g., hormone
treatment. The incongruity between the SA and the chronological age (CA) may indicate
abnormalities in the bone ossification. There are two commonly used methods applied to
characterize the skeletal growth and development of the hand radiographs. Greulich and Pyle (GP)
method, the most commonly used method, is based on a general comparison with standards of the
atlas of hand radiography, but there exists subjective factors resulting in disagreements due to
physicians individual experiences [1-3]. When a radiograph does not match atlas standards, a
subjective interpretation may be given, or unexpected results may occur through an analogous
comparison [4, 5]. The other commonly used technique is the Tanner and Whitehouse (TW)
method. TW method makes detailed analyses of each individual bone and scores points of each
bone. Then, a total score can be acquired to assess the SA [8-11]. Accordingly, there are many
evidences indicated that TW method is acknowledged as more objective than GP method [12-19].
However, the TW method is not popular clinically due to its complexity and heuristics [20-22].
Most of the BA assessment is performed by experienced radiologists or physicians. The
correctness of the assessment is heavily dependent upon the evaluation of persons. Therefore, it is
most liable to cause errors by human effect, such as inconsistent assessments of the same subject
by the same doctor along with different evaluation time or fatigue, inconsistent assessments
among different doctors due to variation of their trainings, experiences, or subjective opinions,
etc. A computer assisted BA assessment system can generate reproducible and reliable
measurements. It can assist radiologists to judge SA more efficiently [23-25]. Therefore, it is
worth developing a reliable computerized BA assessment system. Due to the heuristic processes
and heavy loads of medical doctor to judge BA, the computerized assisted system to evaluate BA
becomes more significant [26-30].
Basically, the carpal SA assessment is based on the analysis of numbers of carpal bones, bones
area and shape [31-35]. Unfortunately, some carpals may overlap with others as growth proceeds,
and thus it is more difficult to make an assessment of SA for patients elder than 10 years old. In
this stage of development, the phalanx’s analysis yields more reliable BA results [31, 36-38]. The
phalanx analysis which extracts the information of growth and maturity of phalanxes is another
method to assess SA by hand radiographs [39-45]. Conventionally, the significant information of
phalanxes is always concealed in the epiphyses. Generally, children came to do BA assessment
are mostly due to height problem [34, 46]. Their parents are anxious to know whether medication
could help them to raise height. However, BA assessment is a tedious load to paediatric
radiologists and difficult for general radiologists as well as clinicians. The fully automatic
computerized (FAC) BA estimation system can certainly be more accurate, decrease
inter-observer difference and save time [47-49]. Furthermore it can be used by more doctors
including paediatricians, endocrinologists and general radiologists. The system is also valuable in
training for BA assessment in junior doctors.

age estimation.
Growth Factors and Features

displacement from the original, respectively. To make a simple math translation of kinetic energy

where Ek is kinetic energy in normal direction; UsN, and UsT represent the elastic potential in
normal and tangential direction, respectively. In simulation, we choose m = 1 and δt =1 for all
cases.
Basically, the property of bone development is non-isotropic and each bone has its growth
speed. That means the spatial features are time-varying. The proposed method is based on two
dimensional growth description, normal and transverse growth indicator.
Longitudinal Spatial Growth
Given an angle θi scanning with two neighboring age, the longitudinal difference between
age(t) and age(t+δt) of bone contour sampling point can be written as.

A demonstration after bone centre locating is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. The demonstration is growth status of Capitate (B1) using proposed bone centre locating
operation. The outer contour represents the elder one of two neighboring age images. From (a)
to (h) represented 0.5-1.5, 1.5-2.5,…, and 7.5-8.5 years old in the female case, respectively.
From the demonstration of Capitate growth, we can see the non-isotropic property in long time
interval.
Carpal Contour Prediction and Recall
By using the longitudinal and transverse growth matrix with geometric condition smoothing
operation, the recall and prediction of carpals become possible. Fig. 2 indicats the flowchart of
the carpals growth estimation and an example result.
Fig. 2. The figures show the bone shape prediction and recall based on the proposed pseudo
force model. Of course, the result of long term prediction and recall is not satisfactory. We can

There are two normalization method revealed herein.
In addition, we plot a graph to describe the pseudo growth energy of carpals. An assumption
is made that the pseudo growth energy is proportional to the displacement square of bone contour
of neighboring age images. Therefore, we can set the growth energy Eg as follows,

Discussion
The growth energy can be used as a growth factor to describe the growth speed of carpals.
The illustration of growth factors is revealed in Fig. 5. Clearly, the growth factor strongly
depends on the bone type and the correspondent age. As the figure shows, B1 and B2 have the
higher energy, i.e. growth speed is faster, when age is below 3 years old, and B3 has a high
growth potential during 5-9 years old. That means we can find the individual growth relationship
of each bone and could make a correspondent table to map the bone age by computer assisted
system.

As the Tables show, we found that the major assessment errors of them are within 1 year old.
Especially the errors of assessment by Type-I before the age of the original test pattern, i.e. 5.5
years old, are all within 0.5. The errors of the Type-II are similar to those of the Type-I. The
performance of these assessments is marginally acceptable. Commonly, the BAE error within 1.5
years old is marginal. The verification results could identify our estimation of carpals and the
fuzzy bone assessment procedures are acceptable, and valuable for providing references based on
computerized procedures in carpal ossification.
