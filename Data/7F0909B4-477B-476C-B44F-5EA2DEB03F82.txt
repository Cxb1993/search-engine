structure with no formation of β-sheets. However, from their infra-red spectra, a shoulder appeared for BSA 
heated above 72°C at 1620 cm-1, which is indicative of beta-sheet formation. Clark et al.[11] using infra-red 
and Raman spectra reported that gels formed from heat and that chemically denatured proteins arose from the 
interaction of regions of beta-sheets. They also noted that a shoulder was visible on their infra-red spectra at 
1620 cm-1 for BSA heated to 75°C and above. Further studies have indicated that BSA when heat-treated, 
goes through two structural stages. The first stage is reversible while the second stage is irreversible, but it 
does not necessarily result in a complete destruction of the ordered structure[12,13]. Results from circular 
dichroism (CD) and infra-red (IR) spectroscopy indicated that β-sheets were formed when albumin was 
heated above 65°C [14], 70°C[13]. Recently, Kongraksawech et al.[15] using optical rotation (OR) and 
transmitted light (TL) methods reported that the denaturation temperatures (Td) obtained from OR 
measurements were consistent with reported differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) values. However, due to 
the small amount of optical rotation signals of BSA under heat treatment, the denaturation temperature was 
difficult to be determined. To overcome the problem of small signals, a sensitivity-enhanced optical rotation 
measurement method was reported[16,17].  
In the present study, instead of measuring the sample’s spectra by IR,[10,14] CD,[13] DSC,[15] as mentioned 
above, or other methods such as X-ray diffraction crystallography,[18,19] and optical rotation 
dispersion,[20,21] we proposed a method which was based on the sensitivity-enhanced method of ref.[17] to 
measure the changes in the optical activity of the sample. We used a home-made optical heterodyne 
polarimeter, which could enhance detection of the optical rotation angle, to determine the temperature 
required to start the conformational change of the BSA as well as the reversible and the irreversible stages. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS AND METHODS 
Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the home-made optical heterodyne polarimeter. The light source is a stabilized 
He-Ne laser with a wavelength of 633 nm. The heterodyne light source was constructed from a half-wave 
plate and two accousto-optic frequency shifters (AOMs). The frequency-shift for each AOM was 40 MHz and 
40.6 MHz, respectively. A lock-in amplifier was used to lock the heterodyne signal. To enhance the angular 
displacement after the sample, a retardation-tunable wave-plate (δ-WP) was placed between the sample (G) 
and a second analyzer (Pol2). By rotating the fast-axis of the δ-WP, the polarization direction of the beams 
passing through the δ-WP rotates the same way. When the polarization direction and the analyzer axis are 
crossed, null-detection occurs. A sharp dip under null condition results in a significant phase change. 
Consequently, the measurement of the phase change around null is likely an angular amplifier. A δ-WP with a 
90 deg phase retardation is equal to the quarter wave-plate. By setting a proper phase retardation and azimuth

Now, the phase difference φ between the measurement and reference signals, as a function of phase 
retardation δ, azimuth θ of the δ-WP, and angular displacement β caused by the sample, can be read simply by 
the lock-in amplifier. The enhancement of this system can reach to two orders in amplitude when the 
retardation of the retardation-tunable wave-plate is set to approach 180 deg. With this polarimeter, the 
measurement of optical rotation angle with a resolution of 1 × 10
-4
 deg has been experimentally demonstrated.  
In the measurement arm, different concentrations of BSA (Sigma Chemical Co. SI-A7906) solution (i.e. 1, 2.5, 
and 5 w/v%), all with a pH of 7.2, were loaded, respectively, into cuvettes for denaturation study. While

For understanding the details of heat-treated denaturation, we performed a series of two-stage heating 
processes on the BSA solutions (2.5 w/v %). First we heated each BSA solution from room temperature to a 
series of higher temperature (see Fig. 3) and kept it at that temperature for 20-min., then cooled it down to 
room temperature, and then heated it up again to 80℃. The results are shown in Fig.3, which shows that there 
is no α-helix denaturation before 65℃ (see Fig. 3a) in the first heating stage, implying that the occurrence of 
denaturation should be beyond this temperature. However, as seen from Fig. 3d there is no denatured peak in 
the second heating stage, implying that the denaturation is fully completed within the first heating stage of 
keeping 71℃ for 20-min. In addition, we observed soluble aggregates (not shown in Fig. 3) when the BSA 
had cooled down from 71℃ to room temperature after the first heating stage. It is worth noting that the 
optical rotation angles restored to their initial level during the even-temperature period of the first heating 
process (see Fig. 3b and 3c). This suggests that when the temperature rises past point A (see Fig. 2) some of 
the alpha-helices are transformed to random coils, resulting in an increased rotation angle. With subsequent 
heating, the transformed random coils may again transform to non-native β-sheets. The transformed 
non-native β-sheets have been pointed out by other researchers [13-14].

from room temperature to a series of higher temperatures (i.e. from 63 to 72℃), then kept at that temperature 
for 20-min., then cooled down to room temperature. The second heating stage: each BSA solution was again 
heated from room temperature to 80℃. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
We built an optical heterodyne interferometric polarimeter which can be used to measure the optical rotation 
angle, based on the sample’s activity, which then allows us to understand the conformational changes of 
proteins. BSA proteins under heat treatment undergo structural changes. For a 2.5 %, PH 7.2 BSA solution, 
the α-helix begins to denature at 66.7 ± 0.8℃. Some of the α-helices are transformed to random coils resulting 
in a changed rotation angle. This state is reversible processes. When the temperature of the first heating stage 
goes up to 69℃ the denatured BSA starts to transform into a rigid network and it becomes an irreversible 
state. Finally, this reproducible interferometric method might have potential for real-time, in situ 
determinations of thermal effects on proteins in industrial processes.

自然界中存在許多具有特殊構型的分子，其分子化學結構具對掌性
(chiral)，即其分子無法經空間的旋轉與同種分子重疊。此種分子與光產生
交互作用後使光的偏振態發生旋轉，我們稱此種分子為光學異構物
(enantiomers)。而一道線性偏振光入射於光學異構物的物質後將產生偏振態
的旋轉，此種物質稱具光學活性(optical activity)，而此種現象稱旋光現
象(optical rotation)，旋轉的角度稱旋光角。自然界中有許多物質具光學
活性，如有機化合物中的特定構型蛋白質以及葡萄糖、蔗糖、乳酸等，或無
機化合物中的石英。自從發現了旋光現象，科學家就常利用此性質檢測液態
物質的濃度或固態物質的分子結構。 
  我們則利用旋光現象來對蛋白質作即時性的觀察。由於蛋白質的二級結
構與旋光角有關，故蛋白質因外在因素作用下改變而導致構型的摺疊
(folding)或展開(unfolding)，將會改變其二級結構。如α螺旋(α-helix)、
β(β-sheet)平板或隨機的圈(random coil)之比列，繼而造成旋光角的變
化，故我們即可由旋光角的變化間接觀察蛋白質構型即時的變化。 
在我們的系統中，我們採用了共光程外差干涉儀來作為基本架構，配合使用
一相位可調式波片來達成相位靈敏偵測的目的，使得系統擁有濃度的辨別能
力約 15 mg/dl或以下，對應旋光角解析能力約在 10-4度的層級，且其濃度最
小偵測極限達 50 mg/dl 以下。我們達到了以往真實相位量測方式無法達成
10-4度層級的角度解析能力。
