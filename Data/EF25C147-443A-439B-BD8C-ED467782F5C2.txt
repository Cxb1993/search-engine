2by the other oils tested, and the maximal EPS production (1147±47 mg/L) was obtained
when 0.5% of peanut oil was supplemented. The high O2 supply in the A. cinnamomea
culture was favorable for cell growth and polysaccharide production, but was inhibitory
on the triterpenoid production. The results obtained are useful in regulation and
optimization of A. cinnamomea culture for efficient production of cell mass and bioactive
metabolites such as EPS, IPS and tripterpenoids in the submerged culture.

Introduction
Antrodia cinnamomea in the Polyporaceae (Aphyllophorales) is known in Taiwan
under the name "niu-chang-ku" or "Jang-Jy". It grows rarely on the inner cavity wall of
endemic evergreen Cinnamomum kanehirai Hay, and is well known as an expensive
medicinal material. It is commonly used as remedy for food, alcohol, and drug
intoxication, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypertension, skin itching and cancer [1]. In the
past, phytochemical investigations have resulted in the isolation of a series of
sesquiterpene lactone, polysaccharides, steroids and triterpenoids. [2-8]. Nevertheless,
systemic studies of the bio-function of the extracted ingredients were not performed until
recently. Polysaccharide components extracted from Antrodia cinnamomea mycelia have
been shown exhibiting an anti-hepatitis B virus surface antigen effect [9], having
pronounced anti-tumor effects on both in vitro and in vivo model [10], and displaying
strong immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects [10-11]. It has also been shown
that triterpenoids extracted from A. cinnamomea have anti-cholinergic and
anti-serotonergic activities.
The fruiting body of A. cinnamomea grows extremely slowly in nature which
prohibits the collection of sufficient quantities for extensive use as a drug remedy. In
recent years, the fruit bodies of A. cinnamomea are expensive because of host specificity
and rarity in nature, and the failure of artificial cultivation; they are sold for as high as
US$ 15,000 per kilogram [1]. Thus, investigators have exerted their efforts to prepare this
mushroom from submerged culture in the form of mycelium for use in the formulation of
nutraceuticals and functional foods [12]. Submerged culture gives rise to potential
4flask culture on rotary incubator shaker (Wisdom 721 SR- Incubator-Shaker) as described
above. Effects of carbon sources and nitrogen sources on A. cinnamomea culture were
studied by substituting various carbon sources such as lactose (L), sucrose (S), maltose
(M) and fructose (F) for glucose in fermentation medium, and by substituting nitrogen
sources such as corn steep powder (CSP), yeast extract (YE) for malt extract (ME) in a
one at a time fashion The concentrations of carbon sources used were from 0.5 to 3 %,
and nitrogen sources were from 1 to 4 %.
Effects of plant oils on A. cinnamomea culture were also studied using shake flask
culture. Plant oils such as soy, peanut, coconut, sun-flower and olive oils were
supplemented, all at volume fractions of 0.1 to 1 %, in liquid media (2 g glucose, 2 g CSP
and 0.1 g peptone in 100 ml of distilled water) and the culture was cultivated at 25℃ on a
rotary shaker incubator at 100 rpm.
Fermentation in a bioreactor and O2 supply experiment
The fermentation medium was inoculated with 10% (v/v) of the seed culture and the
cultivated was carried out in a 5-l stirred-tank fermenter (Firstec Co., Taiwan). Unless
otherwise specified, fermentations were performed under the following conditions:
temperature, 25°C; aeration rate, 1 vvm; agitation speed, 100 rpm; initial pH, 5·0;
working volume, 4 l.
To study the effect of oxygen supply on A. cinnamomea culture, the cultures were all
agitated at the same speed (100 rpm), and the aeration rate was set initially at 1 vvm with
inlet air controlled at 21 % and 30 % oxygen during fermentation. The 30% oxygen was
derived from mixing 21% oxygen (air) with the 95% oxygen produced by an oxygen
generator (EYELA, Model SO-004, Japan).
Determination of mycelial dry weight
For measurement of mycelial dry weight, the mycelia from a sample were filtered
through a mesh with 30 µm pore size and washed with a large amount of distilled water,
then collected by filtration through a pre-weighted Whatman filter paper No. 2 (Whatman
International Ltd, Maidstone, UK), followed by freeze drying to a constant dry weight.
Measurements of extracellular and intracellular polysaccharides
6triterpenoids by A. cinnamomea CCRC36716 were investigated. As shown in Table 1, the
three nitrogen sources (ME, YE and CSP) examined were all favorable to the mycelial
growth of A. cinnamomea; the mycelial growth increased with increasing concentration
of nitrogen source in the tested ranges. However, prolonged cultivation time is not
necessarily required for better cell growth; the cell dry weights (CDW) obtained after 14
d of cultivation (data shown in parenthesis) were not higher than those obtained after 10 d
of cultivation, especially when YE and CSP were used as nitrogen sources. The highest
cell growth (12.52 ± 0.03 g/L cell dry weight) was obtained on day 10 of cultivation in the
medium containing 3 % CSP. In comparison with organic nitrogen sources, inorganic
nitrogen sources gave rise to relatively lower mycelial growth (data not shown). This is
consistent with what was previously suggested that most basiomycetes prefer complex
organic nitrogen sources for their favorable submerged cultures because certain essential
amino acid(s) could scarcely be synthesized from inorganic nitrogen sources in the
fermentations of higher fungi [20].
The effects of nitrogen sources on the production of EPS and IPS by A. cinnamomea
were also shown in Table 1. The increased nitrogen concentration led to enhanced EPS
production for all three nitrogen sources examined. However, it is surprising that the EPS
production titer obtained at day 14 is much lower than that at day 10. The fact that the
level of EPS in the culture medium declined after it reached maximum may be due to the
secretion of polysaccharide degrading enzymes (1,3 glucanases) which were reported by
Bes et al. [21] and Burns et al. [22] for the culture of Phanerocheates chrysosporium and
Plerutous florida, respectively. Under different nitrogen sources, the highest production
of EPS (1861 ± 62 mg/L) was obtained on day 10 of cultivation in the medium containing
3 % YE. It was previously shown that EPS production by Acremonium diospyri was
parallel with biomass over the first 10 days then ceased afterward [23], an observation
that accord with what was found in this work. For the specific production of IPS, as
summarized in Table 1, the maximum IPS content (41±12 mg/ g-DW) was achieved on
day 10 in the medium containing 3% ME. The IPS level after 14 d of cultivation is lower
than that after 10 d of cultivation for any nitrogen source and concentration tested. This is
similar to what was found for EPS production.
Figure 1 shows the effect of nitrogen source on the overall triterpenoid production
by A. cinnamomea in shake flask culture. Of all nitrogen sources tested, CSP is the best
8was relatively low when these two carbon sources were used. This result is consistent
with a previous finding that sucrose as a carbon source was suitable for the EPS
production of Ganoderma lucidum although the cells could not grow well [27]. Also
shown in Table 2, the high concentration of carbon source led to high production of EPS
suggesting that the carbon sources can be utilized to improve the production of EPS;
however, good mycelial growth may not be a determining factor for high production of
EPS in A. cinnamomea. The similar conclusions have been drawn from culture studies of
various edible mushrooms such as Ganoderma lucidum by Sone et al., Phellinus linteus
by Kim et al. and Pleurotus pulmonarius by El-Dein et al. [28-30]. Pronounced
production of EPS, 1482±63 and 1318±48 mg/L, was obtained after 10 d of cultivation
when 4 % of lactose and sucrose was used, respectively. The fact that the level of EPS is
lower after 14 d of cultivation than that after 10 d of cultivation may be due to the
secretion of polysaccharide degrading enzymes (1,3 glucanases) as aforementioned;
however, this is yet to be proven. For the specific production of IPS, as summarized in
Table 2, the maximum IPS content (49±9 mg/ g-DW) was obtained after 10 d of
cultivation when 4% glucose was used. The IPS level after 14 d of cultivation is lower
than that after 10 d of cultivation for any carbon source and concentration tested. This is
similar to what was found for EPS production.
Figure 2 shows the effect of carbon source on the overall triterpenoid production by
A. cinnamomea in shake flask culture. Of all carbon sources tested, glucose is the best
carbon source for triterpenoid production; the highest overall triterpenoid production (31
mg/g-DW) was obtained after 14 d of cultivation when 2% glucose was used. However,
low cell growth and EPS production was found in 2% glucose media. A similar
conclusions have been drawn from culture studies of cordycepin production of medicinal
mushroom Cordyceps militaris by Mao et al.[31]. On the other hand, the longer
cultivation time results the better triterpenoid production and the lower cell concentration
shown on Table2 and Figure2. However, an opposite result reported from submerged
culture of Ganoderma lucidum with inoculation density control. The maximum
production of ganoderic acid (a secondary metabolite) was obtained on the same day as
the maximum cell dry weight of G. lucidum [32].
10
initial O2 supply of 21%; in contrast, the maximum EPS production of 793±4 mg/L was
obtained on day 10 in the culture at an initial O2 supply of 31%. Figure 3 is the kinetic
profile of tripterpenoid production of A. cinnamomea under different O2 supply. The
maximum triterpenoid content of 18 ±0.25 mg/ g-DW was obtained on day 14 in the
culture at an initial O2 supply of 21%; in contrast, the maximum triterpenoid content was
only 8.0±4 mg/g-DW on day 14 in the culture at an initial O2 supply of 31%, indicating
that high O2 supply significantly inhibited the production of triterpenoids. In conclusion,
the high O2 supply in the A. cinnamomea culture was favorable for cell growth and
polysaccharide production, but was inhibitory on the triterpenoid production. The
significant effects of O2 supply on the cell growth, production of Ganodema
polysaccharides and ganoderic acids have been previously demonstrated in submerged
cultures of G. lucidium [36]. However, the effect of O2 supply on A. cinnamomea culture
described in this work is reported for the first time. The results obtained are useful in
regulation and optimization of A. cinnamomea culture for efficient production of cell
mass and bioactive metabolites such as EPS, IPS and tripterpenoids in the submerged
culture.
