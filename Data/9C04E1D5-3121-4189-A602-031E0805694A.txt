1. Introduction 
 
With the arrival of knowledge economy era, enterprises are forced to treat intellectual property rights as efficient 
strategies in enhancing their competitiveness. Herce (2001) once pointed out that enterprise commonly used 
patents to fulfill the following objectives: (1) To assist in decision-making, (2) To form a basis for future 
research and development, (3) To assist in planning the use of new technology, (4) To assist in overcoming 
difficulties in certain technological steps, (5) To assist technology and/or equipment being purchased, (6) To 
assist research and development results, and (7) To achieve several intended purposes. 
 
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) revealed that 90% to 95% of all the word’s inventions can 
be found in patented documents, and 80% of these techniques would not appear in others professional articles 
(Liu, 1997). Patents contain much technical information. Among the unique characteristics of information in 
patents include: (1) practical and specific technological contents, (2) technical reporting, (3) technological trends 
of firms, (4) technological development trend, and so on (Chen, 2000). Thus it can be known that patent 
literature is a significant and enormous technical database. Product designers and research and development 
personnel can browse patent data for understanding of new techniques and developmental trends.  
 
Patent documents are unique documents that are simultaneously technical and legal. Analysis of patent data not 
only helps to understand the research and development of competitors, but also allows firms to grasp 
technologies and market opportunities. However, also because there is a huge amount of patent data and it is 
difficult to interpret, many scholars have devoted themselves to studies relating to patent documents (Huang, 
2008). Since patent documents have been evaluated by various governments, the technical information disclosed 
tends to have considerable quality. However, many scholars continuously use patent data to construct related 
mechanisms or techniques, such as establishment of professional patent systems (Wanner, 2008), patent data 
analytical techniques (Tseng, 2007), and others. Some scholars further apply patent documents in different fields, 
such patent knowledge in breast cancer medicine (Canongia, 2004), using patent paths to establish 
pharmaceutical management mechanisms (Mina, 2007), but because it is difficult to interpret patent literature, it 
caused professionals in different fields to stop short of using the abundant patent data. 
 
Since patents are technical information, directors of corporations find the interpretations for patent documents. 
Therefore, the visualization display of patent documents is extremely important. Shneiderman proposed the 
concept of information visualization, to be applied in window management (Shneiderman, 1997). Visualization 
display can convert abstruse patent data into easily understood professional graphs and charts. Therefore, patent 
maps have begun to be used. Patent maps make patent information “into maps” through visualization. Through 
the analysis and organization of large amounts of patent data, the technical development of specific industries 
can be exhibited. This allows corporations to use the patent maps to understand the state of competition or even 
developmental trends of the industry, so that corporations can establish corporate strategies. 
 
Primary reasons for the proposal of corporate establishment of patent maps are provided by renowned patent

Design patent literature data publicly released by Intellectual property organizations of advanced nations, such as 
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), European Patent Office (EPO), and Japan Patent Office 
(JPO), can generally be divided into two types: (1) background descriptive data (also known as primary data): 
such as data that describes background information, including Patent No., Patent name, Filed, Date of patent, 
Assignee, Country. Usually, primary data can be clearly disclosed from patent publications published by various 
governments. Figure 1 is primary data from the United States Official Patent Gazette (Pfeiffer, 2006); the 
content contains complete background descriptive data of the patent. (2) Technical content data (also known as 
secondary data): or the protection for concrete creation of the design. Usually, secondary data is derived from 
summarizing or analyzing primary data. Therefore, in terms of character of data, secondary data is more 
subjective, but has greater utility. Establishment of design patent maps conduct analysis and determination for 
primary data and secondary data.  
 
2.1 Participants 
 
In order to precisely determine “technical content data,” this study invited design patent examiners from 
Taiwan’s official patent authority – Taiwan Intellectual Property Office (TIPO) – to participate in this study. 
There are 12 TIPO design patent examiners, of which 10 were willing to assist in this study (design patent 
examiners who participated are approximately 83.3% of the total number of design patent examiners); the 
average number of years that participants have worked in patent evaluation is 11 years. Both in terms of number 
of participants and degree of professionalism, this study is highly representative! In addition, in order to match 
the patent examiners group to the industrial designers group in differences in constructing design patent maps. 
This study also uses the same patent samples for 29 industrial designers who have worked in design for an 
average of over 3 years to assist in constructing design patent maps, and compares the design patent maps 
constructed by the two groups. 
 
2.2 Materials 
 
In this study, the author takes design patents from between 2005 and 2007 in the United States car industry as 
research subjects. First, TIPO design patent examiners eliminate patent samples unsuited for this study (such as 
if a sample belongs to Part of Design patent, since the matching subjects are different, it is removed). After 
selection, design patent examiners selected 74 car design patent samples as research subjects (please see Table 
1). 
 
In order to convert primary data to secondary data, the author made car design patent samples into graphical 
cards, which only show the number and appearance of design patents (as shown in Figure 2). Additionally, no 
other textual information is provided, to avoid interference to participants. Then, the patent examiners and 
industrial designers conduct classification of patent sample “homogeneity,” without limit on number of 
categories.

corporations emphasize the application and establishment of car design patents. (3) The top three countries with 
patent assignees are: Japan, Germany, and United States; these three countries are also major automobile 
exporters. The ranking of assignee countries are shown in Figure 4. Corporations can use such data to see the 
current state of patents in car design patents. 
 
3.3 Analyzing secondary data  
 
In order to convert primary data to secondary data to find the “distance” between patent samples, and provide 
patent samples with visualization display, this study uses multi-dimensional scale (MDS) for analysis. Through 
MDS analysis, this study can obtain the distribution of the 74 patent samples in different dimensions. Table 2 
shows the stress and RSQ of patent examiners and industrial designers in dimensions between 2 and 6. 
 
In Table 2, the 2D to 6D stress is smaller than 0.5 for both patent examiners and industrial designers. In terms of 
accommodation, it is quite good. The establishment of patent maps is to allow for ease of explaining the 
distribution of patents. Therefore, since 2D display of patent distribution allows for easy visual interpretation, 
this study chose to use 2D to display patent sample distribution. In addition, in the same dimension, the stress of 
patent examiners are all lower than the stress of industrial designers, but the difference is not large; and the RSQ 
of patent examiners is far greater than that of industrial designers. This means that the output results of MDS is 
more consistent with original data for patent examiners. 
 
3.4 Establishing the overall distribution diagrams for design patents  
 
Based on analytical results of MDS, this study displays the 74 patent samples of patent examiners and industrial 
designers using 2D coordinates. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show distributions and corresponding coordinates of 
design patents determined by patent examiners and industrial designers. 
 
3.5 Interpreting overall distribution of design patents 
 
Based on distribution of patent sample, it is possible to summarize patent examiners into 4 primary clusters, 
which are Cluster A to Cluster D (please see Figure 5); in addition, it is possible to summarize industrial 
designers into 4 primary clusters, which are Cluster E to Cluster H (please see Figure 6). In the overall 
distribution of patent examiners and industrial designers in car patent maps, the distribution differences of patent 
samples are rather large. Of which, the distribution for patent examiners is more concentrated; this shows that 
when patent examiners determine whether patent samples are similar, the determination threshold is more 
stringent than that of industrial designers. 
 
Table 3 shows the overlap of clusters A and H among patent examiners and industrial designers. From Table 3, 
when A, B, C, D clusters (patent examiners) are the standard, the patent sample mean rate of repetition is 29%; 
when E, F, G, H clusters (industrial designers) are the standard, the patent sample mean rate of repetition is 34%.

This study uses five major steps: (1) determining patent sample range, (2) analyzing primary data, (3) analyzing 
secondary data, (4) establishing total distribution of design patents, and (5) interpreting the overall distribution of 
design patents, which are used to propose a model for the establishment of design patent maps. Corporate 
benefits due to establishment of design patent maps include: (1) understanding technical development and 
changes in the industry, (2) understanding the patent pressure from competitors, (3) monitoring the fluctuation in 
patents of one’s own company and of competitors, (4) verifying the patent distribution of the industry, and (5) 
clearly establishing overall corporate patent arrangements and investments. 
 
The effective utilization of suggestions of intellectual property professionals is a must for the construction of a 
comprehensive and feasible “patent map.” The author focuses on car design patents for analysis and 
summarization, to analyze technical and managerial information latent in patent data, for the use of research and 
development and management. This study uses the assistance of senior patent examiners to complete the 
construction of patent maps; since they have had abundant experience in determining patents; results of this 
study are highly reliable. 
 
Because patents are protected by territoriality principle, the protection of design patents is different in various 
countries. However, the visualization display of design patent maps constructed in this study is a generally 
applicable method. It breaks through regional limitations, is transnational and can be applied to different 
countries. The author suggests that corporations can use steps used in this study to gradually construct design 
patent maps and develop these into concrete design strategies. This strategic tool will become a new competitive 
weapon for corporations in facing the era of knowledge economy!
