In this report a highly integrated miniaturized passive integrated module for combo 
WLAN was designed and implemented. The module was composed of several RF passive 
components integrated on a low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC). By using the benefit 
of the multi-layer environment, these components can be embedded in a module size of 
mmmmmm 16.12.3 ××  with excellent performance of low insertion loss, and also satisfied the 
required spurious rejections and harmonic suppression simultaneously. The design will use 
the characteristics of the individual components to reduce the component amount and 
improve the electrical performance.

will be described. Some simulation results will be presented in section III.   
 
II. MODULE DESIGNS  
 
Fig.1 shows the basic block diagram of the RF front-end circuit for combo WLAN. Two 
duplexers, two band-pass filters and two low-pass filters are used for the purposes of band 
selection, spurious rejection, and harmonics suppression. The outputs from duplexers are 
connected to the DPDT switch for TR paths selection and switching between antennas. The input 
signals of the TX low-pass filters are coming from individual power amplifiers of different 
operating frequency bands. In general, the configuration of the duplexer is the combination of a 
low-pass filter and a high-pass filter with matching network connected between (dashed lines 
shown in fig. 2(a)). The electrical performance is very similar to the half operation of the 
band-pass filter each path (as shown in Fig. 2(b)). Therefore, the duplexer in the RX path can be 
replaced by two band-pass filters connected directly by proper matching circuits (as shown in Fig. 
2(c)). This kind of design will be very helpful for reducing the complexity of module integration. 
In addition, low frequency band of the duplexer in the TX path can be designed with proper 
suppression level of harmonics which is also very helpful for omitting the usage of the low-pass 
filter in the output of power amplifier.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
The commercial EM software Sonnet 9.0 was used for circuits simulation. The simulated 
results of the TX performance were depicted in Fig.6. As can be seen, excellent insertion loss was 
obtained in this design. The values were lower than 0.42dB in the frequency of 2.4GHz ~ 2.5GHz 
and 0.86dB in the frequency of 4.9GHz ~ 5.9GHz respectively. For lower frequency path the 
suppression of harmonics (4.9GHz and 7.35GHz) were controlled to the level larger than 28dB 
which is acceptable for the general applications. For higher frequency path the suppression is 
good for second harmonic which has the level larger than 23dB, but is bad for 3rd harmonic. It 
may result in the periodic effect of the distributed structure of the embedded passive component 
which is not easy to control in such higher frequency.
