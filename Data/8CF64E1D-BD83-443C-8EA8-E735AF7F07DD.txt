V2O5 and TiVO4 of crystal grain size about 10 nm formed on anatase support.  In 
contrast, isolated VO4 and small V2O5 clusters were formed on TiO2-SiO2 and SiO2, 
respectively.  Since V2O5/SiO2 presents higher vanadia dispersion but lower activity 
than V2O5/TiO2, it is suggested that vanadia-titania interactions promote the oxidation 
reaction.   The low vanadia dispersion for V2O5/TiO2 can be improved by the use of 
TiO2-SiO2; the mono-layer TiO2 on SiO2 helps anchor vanadia to form isolated VO4 
species.

1. Introduction 
 Because of their extremely high toxicity to humans, dioxins which formed from 
waste incinerator for disposing industrial and city waste in the combustion process 
have a serious impact to environment.  Even through several dioxin control 
technologies have been proposed during the last two decades [1-4], catalytic oxidation 
and activated carbon adsorption are the only two processes commercial feasible. In 
contrast to the drawback of activated carbon that has 2nd waste disposal problems, 
solid heterogeneous catalysts have the advantages of easy recovery and recycling and 
are readily amenable to continuous processing. Therefore, the oxidation of dioxins 
over the heterogeneous catalysts is environmentally benign from the viewpoint of 
‘green chemistry’.      
Many articles have reported on the oxidation of dioxins catalyzed by binary 
vanadium oxide catalysts [5-9]. The catalysts are normally prepared by mixing rather 
expensive titania nano-particles and an aqueous solution of vanadia precursor, such as 
vanadyl oxalate or ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), with subsequent thermal 
treatment.  For an active catalyst, the surface area should be higher than 100 m2/g.  
However, commercial anatase titania normally has low surface area (< 50 m2/g), 
hence, only a small fraction of the titanium oxide on the surface is utilized in the 
reaction.  Moreover, the catalyst is loaded into the reactor in the form of 0.1-1 µm 
granules. Such small granules will cause extremely high pressure drop in a fixed bed 
reactor, lead to reactor plug up and make the commercial operation impossible.  For 
commercial operation, the granule catalyst has to be bonded to form a larger extrudate 
or sphere.  In the process of binding the granules, part of the surface area and, in turn, 
the catalyst activity will decrease.  
 The V2O5/TiO2-SiO2 catalyst preparation reported here comprises formation of 
monolayer TiO2 on the SiO2 support and then deposition of vanadia on it.  The 
monolayer TiO2 on the inert spherical SiO2 support of 1.7-4.0 mm particle size is high 
 
2.  Experimental Methods 
2.1 General Procedures 
Except air calcination, catalyst preparations were carried out with exclusion of 
air and moisture in a nitrogen-filled glove box or on a standard Schlenk vacuum line. 
Commercially available chemicals were purchased and used without further 
purification. Vanadium oxytripropoxide (VO(OC3H7)3), titanium isopropylate 
Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4, were purchased from Acros, spherical silica (CARiACT Q-30, 
surface area of 100 m2/g, average pore diameter of 30nm, and particle size of 1.7 to 4 
mm) from FUSI SILYSIA chemical, and TiO2 nano-particles (surface area of 40 m2/g, 
average crystal grain size < 100 nm) from Merck.  All solvents were dried and 
de-gas with activated 4A molecular sieve under dry N2.  
2.2 Preparation of TiO2-SiO2   
Silica pellets were pre-dried under vacuum evacuations at 120 °C for 12 h to 
remove water.  The silica was brought in contact with a toluene solution of titanium 
isopropylate in a glove box.  The amount of titanium isopropylate added to silica 
was such that the resulting solid would contains 7 wt% TiO2.  The toluene solvent 
was removed by evacuation for 4 h at room temperature and the resulting solid was 
calcined under air at 450 °C for 4 h.  The sample after the calcination was noted as 
TiO2-SiO2. 
2.3 Preparation of V2O5/TiO2-SiO2, V2O5/TiO2, V2O5/SiO2 
TiO2-SiO2, TiO2, and SiO2 supports were dried under vacuum evacuations at 120 
°C for 12 h.  Vanadium oxytripropoxide of 0.88 g was dissolved in 200 mL of 
toluene with stirring for 3 h and 12 g TiO2-SiO2, TiO2, and SiO2 support was then 
added.  After calcinations at 450 °C in flowing air for 3 h, the samples were noted as 
V2O5/TiO2-SiO2, V2O5/TiO2, V2O5/SiO2.  All samples were stored in a 
nitrogen-filled glovebox before synchrotron XRD and X-ray absorption measurement.   
2.4 X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
All X-ray absorption spectra of the V K edge (5465eV) and Ti K edge (4966eV) 
were measured on the beam line BL17C at the Synchrotron Radiation Research 
Center (SRRC) in Hsinchu, Taiwan, with a storage ring energy 1.5GeV and a beam 
current between 120 and 200mA.  Two Rh-coated mirrors (mainly for the purpose of 
collimating and focusing the synchrotron beam) to eliminate high energy components. 
However, the cut-off energy was set to 15 keV for both mirrors so that the third 
harmonics from Si(111)-crystal monochromator may not be completely rejected by the 
mirrors when the fundamental photon energy was scanned around 5 keV.  
Accordingly, the higher X-ray harmonics were minimized by detuning at E0 + 50 eV.  
The ion chambers used for measuring the incident (I0) and transmitted (I) synchrotron 
system used for qualitative analysis was a Shimadzu Model GC-17A-GCMS: 
QP5050(A) equipped with a BP1 (100% dimethyl polysiloxane) capillary column. 
The column was operated at 40 °C to 200 °C with ramping rate of 10 ˚C/min and a 
flow rate of 50 mL/min of dry He. The GC used for quantitative analysis was 
Shimadzu Model GC-14B with a FID detector. The column and operating conditions 
are the same as those for GC/mass spec. CO and CO2 were analyzed by GC-14B 
equipped with a unibeads packed column of 3m x 3mm i.d. and a TCD detector.  
About ninety-six percent of the feed was recovered as reaction products, as estimated 
by material balance calculations.  The 4% loss is attributed to hydrocarbon deposited 
on the wall of reaction system, on the catalyst, and on the surface of ceramic packing. 
  
the EXAFS characterizing V2O5/SiO2, a much lower intensity of the peaks at 3.0 to 
4.0 Å was observed for V2O5/TiO2-SiO2.  Since the intensity is proportional to 
cluster size of V2O5, the much weaker intensity of the peaks for V2O5/TiO2-SiO2 
suggests that vanadia species on TiO2-SiO2 is much smaller than that on SiO2.   
Keller et al. proposed a new structure model for supported VO4 catalysts based 
on UV-Vis-NIR, DRS, ESR, XANE, and EXAFS [27].  In the model VO4 is 
anchored to the support oxide surface with one V-Osupport bond.  Since our XANES 
spectrum characterizing V2O5/TiO2-SiO2 (Figure 4) are quite similar to that 
characterizing V2O5/γ-Al2O3 reported by Keller et al. [27], the structural model 
proposed by Keller et al. was used for detail EXAFS analysis.  Accordingly, 
coordination numbers of the EXAFS functions characterizing VO4 unit were fixed 
and the structural parameters estimated by Keller et al. were used as an initial guess 
for parameter estimation. 
 Coarse structural parameters characteristic of VO4 contributions (V15-O16 and 
V15-O14,17,18; the subscript is the atom label shown in Figure 6) were estimated by 
fitting raw EXAFS data in the range 0.7 < R < 2.5 Å.  The EXAFS functions 
characterizing VO4 contribution were calculated from the estimated structural 
parameters and were subtracted from the raw data.  The residual spectrum was 
expected to represent the interactions between surface vanadia species and TiO2 
(V15-O11, V15-Ti13 , and V15-O2,4 ).  The structural parameters characteristic of these 
three contributions were then fitted the residual data.  The calculated EXAFS 
functions for V15-O11, V15-Ti13 , and V15-O2,4 were then subtracted from raw data and 
better parameters for V15-O16 and V15-O14,17,18 were estimated.  The refinement 
through this iteration was continued until good overall agreement was obtained.   
The final fitting results are summarized in Table 1.  The comparisons of k1 and k3 
weighted data with the fit are shown in Figure 5a and 5b, respectively.  The 
contribution of V-Ti is shown in Figure 5c.   The deviations between calculated and 
experimental data for R < 1.2 Å are caused by the presence of the atomic XAFS 
(AXAFS) and those for R > 3.2 Å are caused by high frequency noise and the higher 
shell contributions not included in the model.  
The structural parameters found from EXAFS analysis were used as input for 
Gauss View molecular modeling program. Geometry optimization of the structural 
model were carried out by the use of B3LYP method with STO-3G basis set.  All 
calculations were performed by Gaussian 03W package [28].  The optimal structural 
model is shown in Figure 6 and the optimal bond distances are summarized in Table 
1a.  Basically, all bond distance are consistent with VO4 anchored on monolayer 
TiO2.  The deviation of the estimated bond distance between EXAFS fitting and 
geometry optimization may be caused by SiO2-anchored VO4 units that have not been 
V2O5/TiO2-SiO2 > V2O5/TiO2 > V2O5/SiO2 (Table 3).   Since catalytic activity of 
TiO2 is significantly lower than that of vanadia species, the catalytic activity for 
V2O5/TiO2 is mostly contributed from vanadia species.  Compared with V2O5/SiO2, 
the lower vanadia dispersion but higher k0 value for V2O5/TiO2 may be explained by 
the decrease of electronic density in vanadia species via V2O5-TiO2 interactions.  
The interactions induce more active sites for nucleophilic attack on the chlorine in the 
aromatic ring of 1,2-dichlorobenzene [33].    
The details of the chemistry for V2O5/TiO2-SiO2 exhibiting highest Ea among the 
three samples remain to be elucidated.  Our observation and the published results  
[14,27,33-35] suggest roles of the VO4-TiO2 interactions and vanadia morphology.  
For catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichlorobenzene, after nucleophilic substitution, surface 
phenolate initially reduces the vanadia active sites and the reduced vanadia species are 
subsequently reoxidized with gas phase molecular oxygen.  Compared to V2O5 
clusters, isolated VO4 with only one V-O bond has less steric hindrance for the 
adsorption of phenolate intermediate and the oxygen-containing compounds formed 
via partial oxidation reaction.  The VO4-TiO2 interactions further strengthen the 
adsorption between the adsorbed species and V2O5/TiO2-SiO2. The strongly adsorbed 
reaction intermediate and partial oxidation species may hinder the adsorption of the 
molecular oxygen and thus retard the reduction-reoxidation cycles.  Higher energy is 
necessary to remove or to destruct the adsorbed oxygen-containing species.  Hence, 
highest Ea are observed for V2O5/TiO2-SiO2.
