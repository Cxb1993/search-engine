corresponding to 10 grid points per rod width w in the whole
space. Two time monitors placed on either side of the 3D
woodpile PCs recorded the fields going through them to
obtain the reflectance and transmittance. In the simulation,
the geometrical parameters used were the same as the fabri-
cated ones, and the wavelength-dependent refractive indices
were also used.7–9 The tantalum layers were ignored because
their thicknesses were too thin.
For achieving thermal emission, the 3D copper PCs
were thermally pumped. The copper sample mount was
equipped with two cylindrical heater cartridges. The samples
were sandwiched between the apertured stainless plate and
the sample mount. Thermal heating of the air and convection
were greatly reduced by placing the heating setup and the
samples in a vacuum chamber pumped to around 105 Torr.
The chamber was set on the three-axis translation stage.
There is an iris diaphragm with an aperture diameter of 5
mm for blocking unwanted radiation, as shown in Fig. 1. The
emitted light from the sample was collected by the parabolic
mirror and fed into the FTIR spectrometer for spectral analy-
sis. The FTIR was equipped with the CaF2 beam splitter and
the MCT detector.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The SEM images of the fabricated 3D copper PCs are
shown in Fig. 2. The overall sample area is 10 5 mm2. The
fabricated structure is not an ideal fct lattice. The copper
rods in the fourth layers are shifted by around 0.30 lm with
respect to the ideal position. Figure 2(c) is the sample with
silicon dioxide mold, and Figures 2(d)–2(f) are the four-layer
structures from top, tilted, and enlarged views after the SiOx
released, respectively. Figure 3(a) shows the measured
reflectance and transmittance spectra as functions of the
number of layers. The unpolarized incident light propagates
along z-direction. At wavelengths longer than 2.00 lm, the
magnitude of reflectance rises when the number of layers
increases. The transmittance reveals the opposite trend. For
the four-layer structure, the reflectance exhibits a dip at a
wavelength of 1.72 lm and some oscillations at wavelengths
below 1.50 lm. Correspondingly, the transmittance shows a
peak at a wavelength of 1.73 lm, which agrees with the re-
flectance results. Below 1.50 lm, the measured signals are
too low to be detected by the detector because of the strong
absorption by the silicon substrate. The measured band edge,
which is defined where the reflectance is 0.5, is located at a
wavelength of 1.95 lm. In particular, the reflectance dip at
1.72 lm (or the transmission peak at 1.73 lm) is close to the
waveguide cutoff wavelength 1.60 lm, twice the air opening
of 0.80 lm. It is attributed that the area open to the air
behaviors similarly to a metallic square waveguide. Above
the waveguide cutoff wavelength, only evanescent waves are
observed, resulting in such a large PBG.
To gain insight into the PBG behaviors, the measured
reflectances were taken with s- and p-polarized incident
light, as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c). Here, s and p polariza-
tion are defined as the electric fields of incident light parallel
and perpendicular to the extension direction of copper rods
in the outermost layer, respectively. It can be seen that the
measurement results are roughly identical for s-polarization.
This is because the waveguide cutoff effect plays an impor-
tant role even for the case of single layer.10 For p polariza-
tion, the forbidden bands are less sharp than those for the s
polarization owing to the longer penetration length into the
3D copper PCs. This leads to stronger scattering at large
angles and only the portion of the reflected light from 3D
copper PCs captured by the Cassegrain objective lens. Even
so, it can be observed that the band edges are shifted to the
shorter wavelengths when the number of layers increases.
This is the evidence for the development of the full bandgap
for the 3D copper PCs. To probe the effect of tilted-angle
incidence on the PBG, the measurements were performed
with a grazing angle objective (Bruker) in the FTIR micro-
scope. The incident light propagated between (001) and
(110) axes of the fct lattice. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show the
measurement results for s and p polarizations, respectively.
The angles of grazing incidence were between 52.2 and
84.2 off normal to the surface of the samples, as shown in
the inset of Fig. 3(d). The results show that the first dips for
both polarizations are shifted to longer wavelengths for the
four-layer structure. This mainly stems from the shortage of
the number of the stacking layers.11
Figure 4 shows the simulation results for the corre-
sponding structures, which agree with the experimental data
for wavelengths above 1.10 lm. This may be attributed to
the fact that the 3D copper PCs exhibit stronger scattering at
shorter wavelengths. The objective lens in the FTIR micro-
scope only detects a part of the reflected signals, resulting in
a discrepancy between the simulation and measurement
results. In addition, the tantalum layers on the side walls of
the copper rods are absorptive for wavelengths below 1.50
lm, resulting in the considerable decrease of reflectance. For

and reflectance for the 3D copper PCs, respectively. For
a uniform thickness copper film, the absorption is low in
this wavelength range because a copper material can be
approximated as a good conductor. This enhancement is
attributed to the flat photonic dispersion at the band edge and
the finite intrinsic absorption of copper. The flat dispersion
represents a slower group velocity of light through 3D cop-
per PCs and a longer interaction time between photon and
copper, resulting in increased absorption.13–17
According to Kirchoff’s law, the absorptance of a body
equals its emissivity.18 Within a PBG, spontaneous emission
is forbidden owing to the absence of photon states that can
be coupled with the atomic transition. At the band edge, the
flat dispersion implies high photonic density of states (DOS),
which facilitate light emission at a narrowband. Through the
redistribution of the DOS, a 3D metallic PC may be useful
for energy applications, such as high-efficiency light sources
and thermal-photovoltaic systems.
An ideal blackbody is defined as a perfect absorber and
also a perfect emitter. The hemispherical thermal radiation
from the blackbody at a temperature T follows the Planck
radiation law, which is given by18
IBBðx;TÞ ¼q0ðxÞuðx; TÞhxc=4 (1)
where q0(x) is the free-space DOS and has the known form
of x2/p2c.3 u(x,T) is the Bose-Einstein distribution function
and c is the vacuum speed of light. Figure 7 shows the calcu-
lated radiation power from the blackbody at different tem-
peratures. The majority of the radiation spectra occupies the
mid-infrared range. High temperature operation is necessary
to shift the emission peak to near-infrared or visible ranges.
The thermal radiation from the 3D metallic PCs can be writ-
ten as17
IMPCðx;TÞ ¼aMPCqMPCðxÞuðx;TÞhxc=4 (2)
where aMPC and qMPC are the extraction efficiency and DOS
of the metallic PCs, respectively. The redistribution of DOS
and extraction efficiency of metallic PCs can be deduced
from the ratio IMPC(w,T)/IBB(w,T), which is also described as
emissivity E. The emissivity specifies how well a real body
radiates energy as compared with the blackbody.18 In actual
experiments, a spectral emissivity of a sample can be
obtained from the following relation

interconnections. The structure has parameters of w/h/
d¼ 0.40/0.40/1.20 lm and its characterization is discussed at
near-infrared wavelengths. The optical properties of PBGs
for the copper PCs have been investigated by experimental
observation and simulation verification. In the stacking
direction, it was experimentally observed that the photonic
band edge is located at wavelengths of 1.95 lm for unpolar-
ized normal incidence. It is also shown that the propagating
modes in our structures are able to be scaled by the refractive
index of the mold in the 3D PCs. Furthermore, the enhanced
thermal emission near the band edge wavelength of 1.71 lm
has been experimentally observed at a heating temperature
of 420 C. The deviation of the emission peak is within 7%
for temperature rising to 480 C.

 efficiency  of those cells from I-V characterization measurement, then evaluate and 
discuss the relationship between Ag nanoparticle preparation condition and cell 
performance. Meantime, we utilized Fourier transform spectroscopy to investigate the 
optical properties before cell fabrication and observed the Ag distribution morphology 
of the sample with SEM and AFM.   
 
Experiments 
 
The experimental processes shown as Fig. 1 and conditions are as following: cleaning 
step first, using ultrasound assisting in acetone bath to remove the organic content for 
15 minutes, then rinsed with De-ionic water for another 15 minutes during ultrasonic 
assisting as well, at last, dried with N2 air gun. The composition of spin solution is 
0.03 M AgNO3. The spin rate is fixed at 4000 rpm while spin times are split into 80, 
160 and 240 seconds. After spun, the samples dried in the air and then treated 
annealing process in furnace for 6 hours at 100 oC, 200 oC and 300 oC, individually. 
At beginning, we try these processes on Corning Eagle 2000 glass to find the better 
condition for depositing Ag nanoparticle. Transmittance and reflectance were 
measured of this Ag particle coated glass by using Bruker FT-IR spectrometer. The 
morphologies of Ag coated samples were observed with Scanning Electronic 
Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). After Ag particle 
deposited conditions found, we coated it on the Asahi-U type  substrate (SnO2:F) and 
using HDPCVD equipment to fabricate p-i-n amorphous Si (a-Si) thin film solar cell 
with PIN structure. The individual thickness p-i-n structure layers in our solar cell 
samples are about 12 nm in p-type layer, ~400nm in intrinsic layer and ~20 nm in 
n-type layer. The backreflector is composed of 80nm ITO and connecting with Al, 
shown as Fig 1 as well. All the conductor of ITO and Al were deposited by DC 
sputtering system. We measured short circuit current Jsc, open circuit voltage Voc and 
energy transfer efficiency  of those cells from Solar simulated instrument with AM 
1.5G illumination  condition  at  room  temperature. Meantime, we also checked 
the number of elementary charges collected at the contacts divided by the number of 
photons impinging on the device, i.e. External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) by using 
grating spectra technique during 300~800 nm range.

Meantime, this textured structure would diffract and reflect the incident with wider 
incident angle. But angle of receiver in FTIR seems not too big and thus results in 
losing some of the light signal. For that, we obtained lower than 1 of the relative 
transmittance like as Fig. 3 shown. On the other hand, this incident light will run 
about inside absorber layer and result in longer trap period then increasing the light 
absorption probability. Accordingly, the transfer efficiency enhancement of cell with 
NAPs modified shows ~9 % higher than that without modified, shown as in table 1. 
From the Fig. 4 the Jsc and Voc are higher for Ag coated cell than that without Ag 
modified. And the EQE (External Quantum Efficiency) with NAPs modified also 
shows same trend as transfer efficiency, especially when incident wavelength above 
670 nm. Thus, we suppose that might result from resonance and scattering effect of 
NAPs modified [17]. Then, those effects would enhance the energy transfer efficiency 
of those cells.
