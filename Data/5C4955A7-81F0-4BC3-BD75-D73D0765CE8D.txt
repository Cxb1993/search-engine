英文摘要 
Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) is 
a technology platform based on the planar 
fabrication process in the IC industry. In 
applications such as wireless sensor networks, 
highly integrated portable or remote devices 
need independent power supply. Due to recent 
advances in low power VLSI technology, the 
power consumption is reduced to a few tens of 
microwatts. Therefore, it becomes feasible to 
power the portable devices by scavenging the 
ambient energy. 
The objective of this project is to develop an 
electrostatic MEMS vibration-to-electric energy 
converter with no external mass attachment on 
an area of 1 cm2 and auxiliary power supply of 
300mV. The targeted energy source is the 120 
Hz, 2.25 m/s2 vibration measured in household 
appliances. The device was designed to generate 
an output power of 0.51µW. Mechanical 
switches are integrated with the transducer unit 
to provide accurate energy conversion timing 
control. Furthermore, the previous design will be 
improved for better performance in this project. 
The device was fabricated in SOI wafers by deep 
silicon etching technology. Measurements of the 
energy converter were also conducted. Without 
the external mass, the measured AC output 
power was 0.42 µW with a load of 5 MΩ at 1730 
Hz. AC output power measurement of the 
devices with external mass attached and 
subsequent mechanical switches measurement is 
in progress.

where the W1 is width of the electrode region in  
the x-direction, W2 is the distance between two 
sets of electrodes in the y-direction, Lf is overlap 
length of fingers, d is initial gap between fingers, 
and f is vibration frequency. Vsat is output 
voltage which is related primarily to the variable 
maximum capacitor value Cmax.

A number of free parameters must be 
considered to acquire the optimum output power 
in the schematic of Fig.3. The guideline of the 
optimization of parameters was presented in [8] 
and [9]. Thus, the output power is a function of 
initial finger gap distance d and overlap length of 
finger Lf, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the 
maximum electrostatic spring constant caused by 
the constant charge Q on the variable capacitor 
Cv. It has great effects on the dynamic behaviour 
of the system since it will alter the mechanical 
spring constant of the system. According to the 
dynamic analysis, the spring constant can be 
presented as follow:

where k is mechanical spring constant and rd is 
the ratio between k and be_max. It is chiefly 
concerned with the maximum displacement 
between fingers.  The detail will be discussed 
in the next section. Fig. 5 shows the maximum 
electrostatic spring constant limitation be_max_lim 
and be_max. The electrostatic force and the 
electrostatic spring effect can be ignored if be_max 
is small than be_max_lim, shown as the available 
design region. According to the constraint for the 
electrostatic spring constant, the maximum 
output power is 0.51 µW with the initial gap of 
37 µm and fingers overlap length of 535 µm in 
our device.

3 Measurements 
3.1 Mechanical measurement 
 
The relative displacement of the device with a 
4 gram tungsten ball was measured using the 
MMA (MEMS Motion Analyser). As shown in 
Fig. 10, the amplitude response has a resonant 
frequency around 120 Hz, which is the expected 
value. The 3dB bandwidth is about ∆ω  = 25 
Hz, and the quality factor is 4.8. Such a low 
value quality factor indicates unpredicted 
damping which is currently under investigation. 
 
3.2 Electrical measurement 
 
The measured capacitance of the device is 
from 105 pF to about 655 pF. The results shows 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.10 MMA measurement of the device with 
external mass 
 
a parasitic capacitance of about 45 pF in the 
device. For VT = 9 V and RT = 10 MΩ, the 
output voltage was 230 mV, indicating a 
parasitic resistance of about 381 MΩ . 
AC power measurement circuit is shown in 
Fig. 12. Two additional 10 pF capacitors CT are 
used to block the DC path of the variable 
capacitor. Thus, the DC bias level of the output 
voltage is reduced to zero, eliminating the static 
power consumption of the device. A 9 V battery 
supply is used for VT in this measurement.

The measured output power versus RT with no

amplitude is maintained at about 6.25 m/s2. The 
resonant frequency is 1730 Hz .The device has a 
relative displacement of about 18.2 µm, and Cmax 
is estimated as 225 pF. The maximum output 
power is 0.42 µW when the load resistance RT is 
about 5 MΩ. The power is lower than the

一、參加經過 
 
 今年 Power MEMS 2007 在德國弗萊堡(Freiburg)舉行，由當地 Fraunhofer Institute for Solar
Energy Systems 的 Dr. Hebling 及 Freiburg University 的 Dept. Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK)的
Prof. Woias 主辦。今年會議共有 100 篇投稿，最後接受 87 篇，論文數量為 2000 年 Power MEMS
開始舉行後最多的一次，由此可看出這個領域已慢慢的成熟並受到一般研究人員的注意。在
會議的前一天，大會另外舉辦了一個 Micro Energy Symposium，主要邀請從事微型能源供應研
發銷售的廠商來演講，因此這方面技術的商品化也正在熱烈的展開之中。 
 
 在 87 篇論文及超過 200 人的參與之中，口頭發表論文有 27 篇，海報發表有 60 篇。以
地區來區分，歐洲有 50 篇(比利時 8 篇，法國 6 篇，德國 19 篇，英國 5 篇等)，美國 14 篇，
加拿大 2 篇，日本 11 篇，韓國 4 篇，台灣 2 篇以及中國大陸 2 篇。以參與機構來區分，目前
主要仍以學校為主，佔 72%，其次為研究機構 24%以及一般公司 4%。台灣目前在這方面投
入的單位不多，值得未來多加努力。 
 
從技術的發展趨勢來看，主辦單位統計了自從 2000 年以來各種技術的論文數，發現微型
燃料電池以及熱引擎相關的論文數量在近幾年呈現穩定的狀態，其解釋可能是技術發展面臨
瓶頸，或是技術發展已經成熟，目前正在克服商品化過程中的困難。此外，能源收集(energy 
scavenging)及電源管理(power management)則是近年來論文數量快速增加的兩個議題。對前者
而言，這種不需任何燃料或電池供應的自發電系統顯然比燃料型微電源裝置更具吸引力，而
日益普及的分散式感測模組及應用系統也間接促成了這個技術的快速發展。就後者而言，電
源管理的重要性表示這個技術已經不只是能量轉換機制可以單獨處理的。在這麼小的輸出功
率之下，必須從系統端的電源管理來做整體的考量及設計，才能有效的使用所產生的功率或
能量。 
 
 另外，大會在現場展示了 IMTEK、Solar Institute 及附近的其他幾個研究機構所研發出的
各種微型電源裝置雛型，包含燃料電池、熱電式能源供應器、電磁式及壓電式等振動型電源

Abstract 
 
This paper presents the design of a MEMS capacitive vibration-to-electricity energy converter with 
integrated mechanical switches for precise timing control. Integrated lateral mechanical contact switches 
have the advantage of zero leakage current, low energy consumption and synchronous operation. The new 
design can provide an output power of 31µW at a 40V output voltage from the targeted vibration with an 
acceleration of 2.25 m/s2 at 120 Hz. The device is fabricated in SOI wafers. Device fabrication and 
measurements are presented. 
 
Key Words: energy harvesting, vibration, mechanical switches, variable capacitor, SOI wafers 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
   
Low power CMOS VLSI technology has enabled 
the development of such applications as wireless 
sensor networks [1] or personal health monitoring 
[2]. Energy scavenging from ambient natural 
sources, such as vibration [3], radioisotope [4] and 
ambient heat [5], is attracting much recent interest 
as a self-sustainable power source for low-power 
applications. This paper presents a capacitive 
vibration-to-electricity energy converter fabricated 
in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. 
In the operation of the capacitive energy 
converter, leakage current, power consumption, and 
timing control of the switches are crucial to 
conversion efficiency. In this paper, a novel 
integrated mechanical switch design is proposed. 
Compared to traditional design with diodes or active 
electric circuit components, the mechanical switches 
have the advantage of zero leakage current, low 
power consumption and synchronous operation. 
  
2. DESIGN 
 
The targeted vibration source in our design is 2.5 
m/s2 at 120 Hz [6]. The converter is composed of a 
3.6 V auxiliary battery supply Vin, a vibration- 
driven variable capacitor Cv and an output storage 
capacitor Cstor connected with the load RL, as shown 
in Fig. 1 [6]. Cv is charged by Vin through SW1 at 
its maximum Cmax, and discharged to Cstor through 
SW2 at its minimum Cmin. To achieve high 
conversion efficiency, the charge-discharge cycles 
must be timed precisely with the variation of the 
capacitance. Since the operation of the converter 
depends on the mechanical oscillation of a proof 
mass, mechanical switches that turn on or off 
according to the position of the proof mass can 
work synchronously in the converter.

2.2 Dynamic analysis 
 
The dynamic analysis is used to decide the 
mechanical spring constant k and proof mass m in 
order to ensure adequate resonance displacement in 
the presence of the targeted vibration. The equation 
of motion is  
e mmz+b z+b (z,z)z+kz=-my   (1)                              
where y is the displacement of the device frame 
caused by vibration, z is the displacement of the 
shuttle mass with respect to the device frame, 
mb (z,z)z   is the mechanical damping force, and bez 
is the electrostatic force acting on the movable 
structure.  
The electrostatic force bez is equivalent to a 
spring force with a negative spring constant be, 
whose value varies with time in the charge- 
discharge cycles. The total spring constant of the 
system becomes k’=k+be. In order to maintain a 
steady resonance, the mechanical spring constant k 
should be larger than be to reduce its effect on the 
system dynamics. Therefore, the mechanical spring 
constant k and the electrostatic spring constant be, 
which depends on the static variable capacitor 
design, must be found from the iteration between 
the static and dynamic analyses.  
The output power of the optimized design is 
shown in Fig. 3. The dynamic response simulated 
by Simulink in Fig. 6 shows a saturation output 
voltage of 40V and output power of 31 µW for a 
load of 50 MΩ.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.6: Dynamic response of output voltage 
 
The effect of switch timing error on the output 
power is also studied by Simulink simulation.  For 
example, SW2 should turn on when the movable 
electrode of the variable capacitor is at the center 
position (Cmin). In this case, the energy in Cv can be 
transferred to Cstor at its maximum voltage, If not, 
the energy is transferred at a lower voltage and the 
efficiency will be reduced. Fig. 7 shows the 
simulated output power vs. timing error of SW2. It 
can be seen that a 500 µs timing error causes the 
output power to drop by 10%.

3. FABRICATION 
 
The device was fabricated in a silicon-on- 
insulator (SOI) wafer with a 200-µm-think low- 
resistance device layer. The device structure was 
first defined by inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) 
etching. Silicon nitride was then deposited by 
low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. The 
backside handle layer under the fingers was then 
removed by ICP etching to reduce parasitic 
capacitance. The structure was released in buffered 
HF solution. Gold or aluminium was sputtered for 
metallic contact. 
Fig. 8 shows the schematic cross section view of 
the fabricated device with the external mass 
attached. Fig. 9 shows the SEM micrographs of a 
device after the first ICP process. Devices have 
been successfully fabricated.
