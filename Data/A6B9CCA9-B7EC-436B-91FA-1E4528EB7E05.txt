modeling, for financial market prediction.  We  have also integrated entropy-based feature selection and 
HMM for data pre-processing and then incorporated a priori knowledge into SVM-based fuzzy modeling for 
predicting the dynamic behavior of stock market. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed 
model.

依存性，則可用 mutual information 的觀念來表示。當我們考慮兩個隨機變數 x與 y時，
它們之間的 mutual information 可用其機率密度函數 p(x), p(y), 及 p(x,y)來定義： 
  
若需判定每個特徵變數與類別之間的相性，我們僅須針對每個 xi計算出其與類別 c的
mutual information,I(xi,c),然後再將它們排序即可。但是在特徵選擇的問題上，找出前 
m個最相關的變數，並不一定就會得到最好的分類結果。

除了找最大相關性的變數之外，另一種手法是找最低重複性(minimal redundancy)的
變數。以下針對最大依存性(maximal dependency)、最大相關性(maximal relevance)、及
最小重複性(minimal redundancy)做說明： 
 
 最大依存性(maximal dependency)：分別計算出變數 xi與類別 c之 mutual 
information，再找出最大者， 
 
 
 
 
 最大相關性(maximal relevance)：找出滿足下式的特徵變數，

Rule_3: IF x1=Gaussmf(0.09,0.02) and x2=Gaussmf(0.10,0.02) and x3=Gaussmf(0.09,0.08) and 
x4=Gaussmf(0.10,-0.08) and x5=Gaussmf(0.10,-0.13) THEN z=-0.02 
Rule_4: IF x1=Gaussmf(0.10,-0.04) and x2=Gaussmf(0.10,-0.08) and x3=Gaussmf(0.10,0.02) and 
x4=Gaussmf(0.09,-0.08) and x5=Gaussmf(0.09,-0.11) THEN z=-0.29 
Rule_5: IF x1=Gaussmf(0.10,-0.03) and x2=Gaussmf(0.09,-0.06) and x3=Gaussmf(0.10,0.03) and 
x4=Gaussmf(0.09,-0.10) and x5=Gaussmf(0.09,-0.13) THEN z=-0.38 
 
以上這五條規則是經過精簡與最佳化的。若非採用 SVM-FIS 而採用傳統做法，規則數
將會達到 27 條。 
 
2.4 知識庫的語意分析(Semantic Analysis) 
SVM-FIS 所萃取出來的模糊規則是用函數及參數來表示的，不容易被人瞭解。為了使
人瞭解其真正意義，及整合專家知識，必須經過語意分析。圖 2 顯示語意分析所使用的語
言項，透過此對應方式可以將 3.3 節中的利用函數及參數來表示的模糊規則轉換成利用語
言項表示的模糊規則。 
 
圖 2：語意分析所使用的語言項 
2.5 背景知識的整合 
在證券市場預測問題中，背景知識包括經濟指標、市場操作的專業知識等。值得一提
的是，機器學習參考的輸入變數多為週線、月線、季線、及年線等均線(Moving Average)
資料，然而實際上專家操盤時考慮的變數除了均線之外，尚包括本益比(P/E ratio)、現金
流量(Money Flow Index)、及成交量(Transaction Volume)等。例如：參考額外的背景知
識，可得到以下規則： 
1.  IF Money Follow Index is very high (MFI>75) 
  THEN Predictive Price is going down. 
 IF Money Follow Index is very low (MFI<25) 
  THEN Predictive Price is going up.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces the system model and some basic definitions.
Section 3 presents the proposed algorithm. Simulation 
results and performance analysis for the proposed algorithm 
are then given in Section 4 followed by concluding remarks 
in Section 5.
II. PRILIMINARIES
We consider a set of n sensors denoted by S = {S1, S2,…,
Sn-1,Sn}, and each sensor has identical capabilities for 
sensing, communication and mobility. Sensing coverage and 
communication coverage of each sensor are assumed to be 
ideal, which means that both coverage areas are disks 
centered at sensor’s location with some radius. We also 
assume that the initial deployment is random and the 
proposed algorithm is performed starting from the initial 
random topology. Further, each sensor has its location
information and initial energy level. 
When sensors are deployed non-uniformly, or failed due 
to some factors such as power depletion and malicious 
damage, coverage holes will arise in the monitored region. 
Definition 1 [Coverage Hole]: If any part of the monitoring 
region R is not covered by the sensing disk of a sensor, that 
part is termed as a Coverage Hole. 
To detect the boundaries of a coverage hole, we adapt a
concept of mono-covered arc from [12].  
Definition 2 [Mono-covered Arc]: The arc pertaining to a 
non-overlapping region of the sensing disk of a sensor is 
termed as a mono-covered arc, and we denote the set of 
mono-covered arcs of sensor Si by MA(Si) = 
{(aI,aJ,)…,(aK,aM)}.  
As indicated in Figure 1, S7 has two mono-covered arcs.
Mono-covered arc implies a region on the outside of certain 
portions of the sensing disk of a sensor that may remain 
uncovered and, then, a set of connected mono-covered arcs 
collectively can define the perimeter of a coverage hole. 
Note that the endpoints of the mono-covered arc are 
represented by an ordered pair of points and the mono-
covered arc is measured in counterclockwise direction 
taking those pair of points. 
Then, to guide the sensor moving to what direction and 
distance, we need to define a polygon for each sensor node. 
To that end, we first define a set of overlapping neighboring 
nodes as below. 
Definition 3 [Overlapping Neighbor]: Overlapping 
Neighbor of sensor node Si is a neighboring node that shares 
a portion of sensing disk with the sensor, and N(Si) denotes 
a set of these neighboring nodes for Si.
As shown in Figure 1, the sensor node S17 has a set of 
overlapping neighbors: S9 and S13~S16. 
Figure 1. Example of a monitoring region R, where a total of 18 mobile 
sensors are deployed. 
As indicated in Figure 1, a set of middle points for sensor 
node S17 are: M(S17)={P1,P2,P3,P4,P5}. These five middle 
points also serve as the vertices in a polygon associated with 
sensor node S17. But, if the sensor node is on the boundary 
of any coverage hole, such as S7, there will be no 
overlapping neighbor for some portion of sensing disk. Thus, 
to build a more accurate polygon to guide the movement of 
sensor node S7, we use the notion of mono-covered arcs (per 
Definition 2) to estimate the other vertices. For each mono-
covered arc, we have a mono-covered chord as defined 
below. 
Definition 5 [Mono-covered Chord]: Each Mono-covered 
arc has a chord which is termed as Mono-covered chord and 
denoted by MC(Si). 
As indicated in Figure 1, MC(S7)={C1,C2}. Then, for each
mono-covered chord, we can specify a corresponding MC-
Endpoint to represent a reference point for the coverage hole 
at the outside of mono-covered arc and also to serve as a 
vertex in the polygon associated with the sensor node. 
Definition 6 [MC-Endpoint]: For each mono-covered 
chord, MC-Endpoint is an arbitrary circumferential point on 
a circle drawn up by using the mono-covered chord as its 
diameter and denoted as ME(Si) for sensor node Si. Further, 
this MC-Endpoint must be situated at the outside of the 
sensing disk of sensor node Si.
After discovering the Middle Points and MC-Endpoints 
as the vertices, a polygon for each sensor node can be 
defined as below to guide the movement of the sensor node 
for repairing the coverage holes. 
Definition 7 [DC-Polygon]: For each sensor node, a DC-
Polygon is formed by using its Middle Points and MC-
Endpoints as the vertices and denoted by P(Si) =(M(Si), 
ME(Si)) for sensor node Si .

point is identical to the previous round, (3) the moving 
distance is too small, and (4) occurrence of oscillation. The 
termination for the proposed algorithm is when all the 
sensor nodes are at quiescent state simultaneously.

B. Oscillation Control 
Oscillation occurs when sensor moves forward and back 
several times. In [8], once the occurrences of oscillation 
reach certain number, the sensor will move to the center 
position of those oscillation points. But it means that each 
sensor has to record the number of  oscillation occurrences. 
In this work, we implement a simple oscillation control 
as given in Figure 5.  Each sensor records its position of last 
round. Sensor is not allowed to move backward to the 
proximate direction of its position of previous round. In 
addition, an island sensor is not allowed to move, because 
there are no other sensors within its communication range 
and, consequently, no DC-Polygon can be formed as well.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
A. Environment Setup 
We have simulated our work using ns-2.33 with 
randomly deployed nodes under different sensor densities 
over an area of 100m × 100m. We distribute seven different 
numbers of sensors, ranging from 60 to 180, in increments 
of 20 sensors. The simulation parameters are setup

sensor nodes. 
Figure 10. Average energy consumption for different number of nodes. 
E. Density Measures 
Since sensors generally consume energy more evenly in 
a uniform topology, Figure 11 displays the effectiveness of 
the density control scheme that is implemented purposely in 
DCMA to improve the non-uniform distribution of sensor 
nodes. Here, uniformity is meant to be the average local 
standard deviation of the density of each sensor deployed in 
the topology. It can be observed that DCMA and DCMA-
AC indeed perform much better than VM in terms of 
uniformity for an average over 30 instances.  
Figure 11. Uniformity for different number of nodes. 
F. Termination 
By increasing the number of sensor nodes in any 
topology, the number of rounds needed for dynamic 
maintenance algorithms to reach a termination state 
generally should also be decreasing. Similar to Figure 7, 
Figure 12 uses a different method to examine the issue of 
convergence. It can be observed that DCMA-AC and 
DCMA need far fewer rounds than VM to reach a 
termination state. It can also be noted that, with 
implementation of convergence acceleration strategy, 
DCMA-AC is slightly better than DCMA. 
Figure 12. Termination for different number of nodes. 
G.  Sensitivity of Communication range 
We randomly deploy 60 sensors in the platform and vary 
the communication range from 1.5 times to 5 times of 
sensing range (Rs) to evaluate its impacts on the 
performance. As indicated in Figures 13 and 14, in terms of 
coverage and average moving distance, DCMA and DCMA-
AC are less impacted by different communication ranges.
On the other hand, VM depends more on larger 
communication range to form a more accurate Voronoi 
polygon to guide the movement of sensor nodes.

of sensor nodes is fixed at 80.

Abstract— In a wireless ad hoc network, multiple end-to-end 
flows that traverse through the same wireless communication 
range compete for the shared wireless bandwidth. Then, how 
to allocate those shared bandwidth among flows is one of most 
critical issues for the system performance. To that end, this 
paper proposes an auction-based bandwidth allocation with 
multi-hop flow coordination mechanism to enhance various 
performance measures.  Experimental results suggest that the 
proposed approach outperforms other approaches in terms of 
network throughput, bandwidth utilization, fairness, end-to-
end delay, and packet loss rate.  
Keywords: Ad-Hoc Networks, Bandwidth Allocation, Resource 
Contention. 
I. INTRODUCTION
A wireless ad hoc network is a collection of wireless 
nodes which form a network without any infrastructure or 
centralized control. The decentralized and dynamic nature 
of ad hoc networks means that information must be passed 
from node to node. When multiple nodes like to 
communicate each others, multi-flows that traverse through 
the same wireless range may contend for the shared wireless 
bandwidth. Hence, how to allocate the sharing bandwidth 
among flows is of the most critical issues for the system 
performance [12].  
In recent years, there are several approaches that have 
been proposed to address the problem of bandwidth 
allocation in a wireless ad hoc network. [4] presents a max-
min fair allocation scheme for the environment with single-
hop flows. Then, [6] proposes an end-to-end fair bandwidth 
allocation for multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks. The 
objective function for this allocation mechanism is to 
maximize the flow rates, but the network configuration 
considered is composed of static or quasi-static nodes. 
Then, a group of game-based approach bandwidth 
sharing and allocation schemes for wireless ad hoc networks 
are proposed in [3], [5], [14], [13]. Users are charged 
according to the overall price of the resources they are using
and the goal is to achieve max-min fairness. Careful choices 
of utility functions allow proportional fairness or max-min 
fairness to be achieved. However, those approaches have a
relatively high computational complexity and long 
convergence time, which could seriously undermine their 
applicability.  
Then, [11] proposes an auction-based bandwidth 
allocation mechanism for wireless ad hoc networks. The 
bids of flows depend both on flow’s utility function and 
intrinsically derived shadow prices. But, this scheme is only 
for single-hop bandwidth allocation. 
In this paper, we propose a multi-hop auction-based
bandwidth allocation mechanism to solve the resource 
contention problem in wireless ad hoc networks. By 
modeling the problem as an auction-based structure, it 
enables us to derive efficient bandwidth allocation to each 
node on the basis of only local information. We also 
develop a multi-hop coordination mechanism to enhance the 
network throughput, bandwidth utilization, and other 
performance measures.  
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II describes the bandwidth allocation problem in 
wireless ad hoc networks. The proposed auction-based 
approach is presented in Section III. Simulation results then 
are given in Section IV followed by the conclusions in 
Section V. 
II. PRELIMIARIES 
A. Basic Definitions
We consider a wireless ad hoc network with n nodes. A
pair of two nodes is considered as connected if these nodes 
are in the transmission range of each other. In the ad hoc 
network, there exist multiple simultaneous communications 
in which a communication means a multi-hop bidirectional 
flows between source and destination nodes [1], [3]. 
However, each communication over a sub-flow has to 
occupy some wireless bandwidth. And sub-flows may 
content with each other if the source or destination of a sub-
flow is within the interference range of the source or 
destination of other sub-flows. 
Formally, a wireless ad hoc network can be regarded as 
a bidirectional graph G = (V, E), as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The 
set of vertices V of graph G represent that there are n nodes 
in the network. Each node i

V has a transmission range dt
and an interference range di, which can be larger than dt.
The set of wireless links, which are formed by the nodes 
within the transmission range of each other, are denoted as

conditions, but sub-flows are not able (or willing) to 
exchange all the information they have. 
Consider an environment where includes an available 
bandwidth Bj, and a set of sub-flows Fj in the clique j. Each 
sub-flow fi,j F wishes to acquire a bandwidth xi,j with the 
budget bj assigned by the source node of flow i. To 
coordinate the source node of each sub-flow to allocate 
mutual exclusive resources, the process of bandwidth 
allocation in a clique can be regarded as an auction process 
in which the source nodes of sub-flows are viewed as the 
buyers and the bandwidth can be divided into a set of 
resource units, which are the goods to be sold [1], [5], [10].
For saving the communication overhead among the sub-
flows, a clique-leader node will be elected according the 
minimal node id while the clique is constructed. 
During the auction process at each period t, the sub-flow 
fi,j   Fj  calculates a unit price 1,
t
i jp
 for a resource unit, 
based on the last price ,
t
i jp , the most desired bandwidth bi,
and the price/cost of resource unit tjy , which is defined as

where wi,j is the weight of contention factor. 
Meanwhile, the sub-flow fi,j may decide to update the 
desired quantity of the required bandwidth 1,

auction in order to increase the possible bid according to

where ui,j is the budget for unit resource assigned from the 
source node of flow i. 
Then, the sub-flows send the bid ( 1,
t
i jp
 , 1,
t
i jx
 ) which 
involves the price of unit resource and the quantity of 
resource to the auctioneer (the clique leader). 
Once the auctioneer has collected all sub-flows’ bids, it 
will decide the quantity of resource units in which sub-flow 
will be allocated, and recalculate the price of resource unit 
according to the contention level.  
For allocating multi-units in an auction round, the 
auctioneer will select the bids (pi,j, xi,j) of sub-flow fi,j   Fj
based on revenue ri,j = (pi,j, xi,j), and the quantity of assigned 
bandwidth ai,j  is according to

. 
As a result, the quantity of assigned bandwidth ai,j
obtained by sub-flow fi,j depends on the demands of the 
other sub-flows fk,j   Fj having the revenue rk,j superior to 
his revenue ri,j. The last winning sub-flow fi,j may thus have 
his demand partially satisfied by the remaining quantity not 
sold to the others. 
According to the contention level, the new price yi,j of 
each resource unit is updated by 
, , ,1( * ) / ,i j i j i j iiy a p B  (8)
Then, the allocated resource unit ai,j and new price of 
resource unit yi,j will be informed to the sub-flows fi,j in the 
clique. 
This auction process may stop either when no conflict is 
present in the union of all bids, or because a given number 
of iterations are reached. In this case, the sub-flow will 
inform the source node of flow about the results of 
bandwidth allocation in the clique including the allocated 
resource unit ai,j  and the price of resource unit in this clique. 
Then, the source node of flow can adjust the budget 
constraints of sub-flows according to the contention of 
cliques. 
B. Flow adaption for  Multi-hop Coordination 
When flow’s source node receives the updated 
information about the new bandwidth decision from all the 
cliques on the end-to-end path of the flow, it will choose the 
lowest bandwidth proposal from the sub-flow.  
Without the fully information about the degree of 
contention in the cliques, the source node may 
over/underestimate the problem, the allocated bandwidth 
could be variously different at each sub-flow. In these cases, 
some sub-flows that with hindsight could offer a proper bid 
are rejected; or a resource price unnecessarily increases its 
bid to the detriment of bids for other resources. Hence, 
coordination for allocating along the path has to be well 
designed. 
For a source node of flow i, After receiving the updated 
information from the all sub-flows Fi, the path cost/prices 
will be re-calculated by
, * ,ii i j jj Gy a y  (9)
where ai,j is the allocated bandwidth in the clique j and the 
unit price of clique j is yj. 
According to the path prices yi, the budget of resource 
unit ui,j of the sub-flow fi,j   Fj is defined as 
, , ,(( ) /( )),i j i j i j j i iu u u y U Y 	 	 	 (9)
where Ui is the total budget of flow i. 
If the path prices larger than the total budget of flow i,
the required bandwidth will be adjusted according to 
max *( ),j i i ib b U Y 	 (10)

Further, it can also be noted in Figure 4 that the AMH 
has the best fairness index as well. While the fairness index 
of AMH is even better than that of OPT-LP and almost 
keeps steady regardless of the number of flows. 
B. Variation in number of hops per flow 
In the second experiment, we examine the effect of flow 
coordination by varying the number of hops per flow. 
Simulation parameters in this experiment are given as below 
in TABLE II.  The number of flows is fixed at 40. 
TABLE II. SIMULATION PARAMETERS IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT
System Parameter Value
Area 1500*1500 m2
Communication range per node 100m
Network size 200 nodes
Number of end-to-end flows 40
Hops per flows [1, 10]
Bandwidth per clique 5 Mb
Max Traffic Request per flows [100kb, 1Mb]
Though the number of flows is fixed, flows might 
contend for the same resource with each other while the hop 
count per flow is increasing. Beside, the allocated 
bandwidth of a flow may have large variation in the 
different cliques. This discrepancy will let some nodes with 
less resource becoming the bottlenecks during the 
transmission. Further, this effect become more seriously 
with the increase of hop counts. Hence, it can be observed in 
Figure 5 that the throughput decreases with the increase for 
the number of hops per flow. But the throughput of AMH 
with the flow adaption mechanism still can keep close to the 
performance of OPT-LP. Besides, it also can be observed in 
Figure 6 that the wasted bandwidth of AOH, Max-Min and 
FCFS approaches increases rapidly when the hops per flow 
is larger than 3. This also can be observed in Figure 7 on the 
fairness with a sharp decrease. 
C. Impacts of Mobility 
In the last experiment, we examine the performance by 
varying the speed of mobile nodes. A random waypoint is 
used as the mobility model. The number of flows is fixed at 
20. Simulation parameters for this experiment are given in
TABLE III.
