study. When the train propulsion comes to this supply 
mode, the inverter control system at power station 
must know when the stator current begins to turn down 
and the supplied stator segment is going to change. 
Therefore, the time points to adjust the stator 
current become very important for the operating 
system of Transrapid and can be determined by vehicle 
dynamic conditions. According to the calculated 
results, the power supply changing from one stator

2.1 INTRODUCTION 
  Although the German maglev train system, Transrapid, has now entered commercial operation 
(Shanghai-Pudong International Airport Line), its improvement of operation technology is still ongoing. The 
power supply technology of synchronous linear motor driving systems is one important topic. The Transrapid 
propulsion system is devised to operate in different modes based on acceleration periods (or short distance 
line) or constant speed intervals (or long-distance line). The propulsion system needs high thrust to accelerate 
the train at startup so that the stator segments are connected by a three-step method [2][3]. This three-step 
method consists of three converter- and power cable-systems. In contrast to the three-step method, however, 
the change-step method requires only two converter- and power cable-systems. In order to reduce investment 
costs of substations, the power supply of Transrapid will be designed to switch to change-step mode when the 
train travels at a constant speed [2][3]. In addition, stator winding loss can also be reduced significantly 
because power is only supplied to the segment over which the train just passes. Therefore, when the train is 
about to leave the current segment, the power supply should be switched off timely. And the power must be 
transferred to the next stator segment. Such a process can result from turning off and on line switches 
(vacuum breaker) along the guideway. Since the on/off actions of line switches are frequent, the line switches 
should be operated at no-load condition of the stator current, so as to prolong their lifetime. Moreover, the 
stator current should be prevented from changing sharply from full-load to zero or vice versa; otherwise the 
ruck of the vehicle may exceed its limitation [4]. (The word ruck means “jerk” with physical measure in the 
unit of m/s3.) Therefore, in order to allow the train to run smoothly and power supply equipments to operate 
safely, the control centre must adjust the stator current up or down at right time and place (according to where 
the train is presently) and carry out on/off actions of the line switches. 
Timing control of stator current and line-switch actions enacts an essential role in automatic operations of 
the maglev train. However, little is addressed yet in the literature about resolving such operational parameters 
for the change-step method. As a remedy, this study concentrates on the analysis of a change-step propulsion 
system. Through rigid analysis, control parameters of stator current can be determined. Moreover, the 
influence on thrust by adopting the change-step method will be calculated as well. 
2.2 TRANSRAPID PROPULSION SYSTEM 
A. Overview 
The basic structure of the propulsion system consists of two main parts, substation block and guideway 
section as illustrated in Fig. 1. Both parts collectively form the drive control zone capable of driving, 
accelerating, and decelerating a maglev train. The propulsion block (substation) includes a plurality of 
subunits such as motor section control, diagnostics, data transfer, and converter units. The block is located 
beside the guideway and can have a maximal distance of 50 km [2][3]. The guideway section can be 
subdivided into a wayside switchgear, a feeder cable system, line switch stations, and stator segments that are 
situated alongside.  
The propulsion system receives all dynamic operation data from line sections online and decides on a 
workable mode to drive the maglev vehicle on the control zone. Nowadays the change-step type of propulsion 
 6
However, both factors produce conflicting outcomes. If a small ruck is desirable for better driving comfort, a 
long controlling time of convert unit for adjusting the stator current is needed, which causes more thrust drop 
though. A solution to this problem signifies a trade-off between moderating the two factors.  
In order to smooth the operation of the change-step-based propulsion system, the process during changing 
periods must work correctly. Accordingly, the time point for adjusting the stator current is one of the most 
important control parameters. Such timing can be governed by several determinants including vehicle data, 
speed, running resistance, boundary conditions of driving comfort, and equipments characteristic. These 
determinants will be quantified in the following analysis.  
2.3 DETERMINATION OF THE COMMUTATION TYPE  
A.  Basic Definitions 
The line vacuum breaker switches in accordance with the following sequence during section changing. First, 
the stator current must be reduced to zero. Then, the line vacuum breaker is switched over to the next stator 
section. The midpoint of the train length is located on the junction point of stator sections at this moment. 
Finally, the stator current is going to adjust to the rated load. The process of alternating the stator current 
between down and up is termed commutation and the corresponding time is referred to as commutation time 
tK. 
Besides the commutation of inverters, the section changing process is introduced below, as illustrated in 
Figure 4. The point of time t0 at which the vehicle arrives from the power supplied section Sn into the next 
not-yet supplied section Sn+1 is called change beginning. The time t1 at which the entire vehicle transits from 
the previous stator section Sn is called end of change. The elapsed time from t0 to t1 is defined as the change 
time tC. Depending on the speed and vehicle’s length, the duration tC can be equal to, larger or smaller than the 
commutation time tK. 
 
B. Three Operation Modes 
Based on various needs of commercial operations, the travel time between start point and destination is 
made flexible so that the Transrapid is not driven at the same speed for every trip constantly. According to the 
boundary condition of every trip, three different modes of operating the change-step method are possible. 
They are classified by comparing the change time and commutation time as follows: 
 
y premature commutation, tC < tK, 
y simultaneous commutation, tC = tK, or 
y late commutation, tC > tK. 
Amongst the three modes, considering the reference speed (see the next subsection) under simultaneous 
commutation (tC = tK) is quite reasonable, because we can determine the type of commutation in comparison 
with this speed. However, the case of the simultaneous commutation is relatively rare, because the operating 
speed usually deviates from the reference speed. If train speed is greater than the reference speed of 
simultaneous commutation, premature commutation is used. On the contrary, when the train is moving slower 
than the reference speed of simultaneous commutation, late commutation should be taken.

Letting lV be the vehicle length, the change time takes on tC = lV/v. Given tC = tK, the reference speed vS of 
simultaneous commutation can be expressed in part of the following form.

FN depends on v-1, v0.5, v0.7 and v2, so vS can be numerically solved from Eq. (8). Note that vS is not fixed but 
varies when different vehicle data are in use. With reference to the reported information of vehicle TR-09 [7], 
where a car is 50 tons and 25 m long on average, example vS’s  are shown in Table I and Fig. 6, respectively. 
Table I lists reference speeds for different vehicles. Fig. 6 indicates that premature commutation will be used 
when a 5-car train with ruck limitation 0.25 m/s3 travels faster than 330 km/h. However, if the train speed is 
less than 330 km/h, late commutation is chosen.  
2.4 CALCULATION OF THE SETTING POINT OF COMMUTATION AND RESULTS 
Whilst operating the change-step method, it is crucial to know when the commutation begins. If timing for 
commutation is ill chosen, the change-step method may lose its advantage and lead to ineffective operations 
of long stator linear motor driving. However, if correct timing for commutation is known a priori, the 
operating system of Transrapid allowing for other parameters can proceed smoothly. Observe that timings for 
commutation start are dynamic and depend on several parameters, e.g., length, mass, and travelling speed of a 
train. Although three types of commutation were introduced in Section III-B, the calculation of starting points 
of the commutation are essentially similar in three cases, i.e., (i) tC = tK , (ii) tC < tK , and (iii) tC > tK . To 
simplify our calculation, the start time of the stator section changing is generally agreed to zero. 
 
A. Simultaneous Commutation, tC = tK 
In this circumstance, the start of commutation coincides with the beginning of section change. It is evident 
that the time setting can be easily obtained when the train head in motion is just located at the junction of two 
neighboring stator sections.  
 
B. Premature Commutation, tC < tK 
For premature commutation, the stator current starts to decline before the train is leaving for the next stator 
section (see Fig. 7.) In the change-step procedure, ruck plays an important role for the commutation. The 
starting point of commutation can be calculated from the approved ruck. The ruck, the derivative of 
acceleration, can be determined by changing the train thrust FS(t). The thrust curve of the premature 
commutation is plotted in Fig. 7. Eq. (9) expresses the ruck r(t) for the corresponding time intervals.

The ruck can also be determined from Fig. 9 and Eq. (12) below.

Given the approved ruck R, we can now calculate the beginning point t1 of commutation. But, the ruck during

As with afore-mentioned premature commutation, the distance parameter l0 of late commutation depends also 
on ruck, mass, and speed of the train and its value will be positive. This means that the beginning point of 
commutation is located behind the switching point. The influences of ruck and speed on l0 are shown in Fig. 
10a and Fig. 10b.  
 
D. Software Development 
For commercial operation and management purpose, the propulsion system of Transrapid must work 
automatically. The parameter l0 is geared to different types of commutation by the computer program in an 
automated manner. The computed results are sent to corresponding units or control components as needed
