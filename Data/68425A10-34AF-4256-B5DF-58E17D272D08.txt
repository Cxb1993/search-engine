Under the condition of low profit environment, many firms are no longer able to use traditional hiring 
practices and are forced to use temporary workforce resulting in a more flexible workforce. Use of temporary 
workforce is becoming a common practice. Past research was mostly done from the standpoint of legal perspective 
and employment relationship. Little research has been done from the perspective of temporary workforce contract. 
Therefore this research will be from the perspective of a temporary work agency to propose two types of skill 
allocation method for a client. Under the condition where the temporary work agency’s multi-period contract does

with basic training. Afterwards as the time for the demand draws near, the temporary work agency provide the 
laborer with additional specialized training. 
 Figure 1 shows the operation method of the temporary work contract which combines the period quantity 
adjustment and total quantity adjustment concept discussed earlier. First, before the time period of the actual demand 
(to ), the temporary work agency and the user firm signs a contract agreement.  The contract context includes 
period quantity adjustment flexibility (α) and total quantity adjustment flexibility (β).Next, at the time period ( t1) , 
the user firm provides an initial order quantityQt11 Qt12  for the various laborer to the temporary work agency 
based on expected demand quantity.  Based on the initial order quantity, the temporary work agency hires the total 
labor quantity (Ot1  Then the user firm revises the original expected demand quantity based on the latest market 
information I1I 2. At period ( t 2 ), the user firms provides the temporary work agency with the modified order 
quantityQt21 Qt22 of the various laborer. The modified order quantity of the various laborers must be within the 
allowable period adjustment flexibility and the total quantity must equal the original total order quantity. Once the 
temporary work agency receives the revised quantity, they will initiate the training of the laborersO

Finally, the actual demand occurs at period ( t3  where the total quantity adjustment flexibility allows the user firm 
to increase the order quantity of the various laborer to fulfill the final actual demand.

manufacturer. Iyer & Bergen (1997) discussed the impact of quick response in the fashion clothing industry. Other 
then showing that the actual use of quick response may not be beneficial to the manufacturer, the author further 
proposes, however, that through the use of service level, wholesale pricing and quantity commitment, quick 
response can be implemented to achieve mutual benefit for both the manufacturer and the retailer. Gurnani & Tang 
(1999) specifically discusses the situation where a retailer has two opportunities to orders with the manufacturer 
before the sales season. In order to determine the optimal ordering strategy, the author assumes actual demand and 
market information in accordance with binary normal distribution (correlation value of actual demand and market 
information  to develop the nested newsvendor model. The author, hence is able to obtain the optimum solution 
within the boundary of worthless information    and perfect information  . Houmin Yan. Ke Liu & 
Arthur Hsu2003study how an updated demand forecast affects a manufacturer's choice in ordering raw material. 
With demand forecast update, we develop a model where raw materials are ordered from two suppliers—one fast 
but expensive and the other cheap but slow. 
 Donohue (2000) on the other hand, focuses on developing a contract based on two production model of the 
manufacturer and two ordering opportunity for the distributor for a single product, single period. The contract allows 
the distributor two ordering opportunities before the sales season. The two ordering opportunities gives the 
distributor time to obtain most current market information available to help determine the order quantity of the 
second ordering opportunity. This research found that under the condition of perfect information (assumes that 
observable market information reflects the customer’s actual final demand), a contract that coordinates manufacturer 
and distributor is a channel for maximum profit. Haoya Chen & Jian Chen2006consider a two-stage supply chain 
in which the manufacturer decides the initial production quantity in the first stage, and the retailer specifies her order 
quantity in the second stage after the demand forecast is improved. They propose a risk sharing contract that 
requests the retailer to partially compensate for the manufacturer’s loss that is attributable to the overproduction in 
the first stage, and the manufacturer to provide a partial credit for the retailer’s loss that results from overstocking in 
the second stage. 
 In order to simplify the development of the model and solution, this research considers the definition and use 
of perfect information proposed by Donohue (2000) and Sethietal (2003) from above and, for the purpose of this 
research, further assumes: The market information obtained by the buyer I is actually the customer demand D, where 
I=D 
 
3. Models 
 Current research uses the contents of the contract to provide user firms with the flexibility of order adjustment 
and quantity adjustment. The research also uses conditional expectation to create a two stage expected profit strategy 
model. Finally, the research uses backward-solving to help both the temporary work agency and user firm to decide 
the optimum order quantity for the various labor types while at the same time maximizing profits for both 
companies.  
 
Variable definition 
R 	User firm 
 7
P j	The output of each type of laborer, j=1, 2
S tj1	The cost in managing each type of laborer before training by the temporary work agency, j=1, 2 
S tj2	The cost in managing each type of laborer after training by the temporary work agency, j=1, 2 
STj 	The cost in dealing with each of the final unused laborer at the user firm, j=1, 2

ρ j 	 The penalty imposed on the user firm for each laborer over-ordered during the second quantity adjustment 
period, j=1, 2
Based on all the different market information received, the ordering strategy of the user firm 
will also be different. However, when the user firm is deciding on adjusting the order quantity, 
they must also consider the flexibility of the period adjustment and its limitation. In order to 
simplify the solution and explanation, we use the graphic description decision variable of Qt11 
Qt12assuming: Qt11 Qt12 with the relationship of period quantity adjustment α. At the same time 
we separate it into 10 regions represented by n. 
Within this range, the final basic laborer hired will not fulfill the demand, but the final 
specialized laborer hired can fulfill the demand. The entire final basic and specialized laborer 
hired can also fulfill the demand.

 In order to simplify the model and solution as well as not biasing the research from its main purpose, the 
research considers K. L. Donohue (2000) and Sethi et. al. (2003) and further assumes the condition of perfect 
information. This means that the newest market information obtained by the user firm is the actual demand where 
I j D j . Hence, at time t2  the user firm knows the actual demand without having to wait till time period t3  
This allows the user firm at time period t2 to use both the period quantity adjustment and total quantity adjustment 
to decide on the final order quantity, there by providing the temporary work agency this information in advance. 
Summing up the above, the issues facing the user firm in order to decide on Qt11 Qt12 Qt 21 andQt 22 in order to

affect of the changing parameter on the total order quantity and the total expect profit.  
 
5.1.1 The impact of period quantity adjustment flexibility () on contract 4 
 From figure n we can see that in a combined period quantity adjustment and total quantity adjustment dispatch 
contract, a comparison between the various expected profit under different period quantity adjustment flexibility () 
produces the following results:  
(1) Expected profits for the user firm increase in accordance with the increase invalue. Therefore, we know that 
in comparison with a contract that only offers period quantity adjustment, a combined period quantity 
adjustment and total quantity adjustment dispatch contract can avoid the negative impact that period quantity 
adjustment flexibility on the temporary work agency. Also, user firm can use the total quantity adjustment, 
which occurs after the period quantity adjustment, to decide on the final order to increase expected profit.  
(2) Expect profits for the temporary work agency also increase in accordance with the increase of value. From 
this we know that in a combined period quantity adjustment and total quantity adjustment dispatch contract, the 
temporary work agency will consider the penalty cost, therefore will not intentionally inflate the demand 
situation resulting in a negative impact for the temporary work agency. Hence the expected profit for the 
temporary work agency will increase in accordance with an increase in the value of . 
 
Comparison of the four types of dispatch contract 
 Figure 1 compares the various expected profit of the four different contract models under different period 
quantity adjustment flexibility (). From this we can learn the following:  
(1) No matter what is the value of , we can see that under the condition where there are no changes in any of the 
other parameters and the existence of period demand adjustment, the total expected profit of contract 4 and 
contract 2 is always higher than contract 1. Sharing the potential risk can also aid in increasing total expected 
profit. 
(2) In contract 2, the total expected profit will first rise with the increase in the value of  , but later the total 
expect profit will fall as grows even larger. Speaking strictly as a whole, under the condition where there 
are no changes in the other parameters, a small  value result in sharing of risk thereby helping raise total 
expected profit. However, as the value of  increase, the user firm will generate a surplus in a particular 
laborer and a shortage of another type of laborer due to an over abundance of order quantity adjustment 
flexibility. The expect profit will also decrease. In contract 4, the total expected profit increase along with the 
increase of  value. Hence, we can see that a combined period quantity adjustment and total quantity 
adjustment dispatch contract can lower the impact of an overly large  on expect profit. Another words, the 
large the value of does not mean it will benefit total expected profit. We see that different contracts has 
different optimal  value.  
 
5.1.2 The impact of total quantity adjustment flexibility () on contract 4 
(1) The expect profit of user firm increase in accordance with the value of . We can see that not only does an 
increase  value provides the user firm with more flexibility in the order quantity, but also can reduce all 
 15 
 
Comparison of the four types of dispatch contract model 
 Other than contract 4, the total expected profit of each of the dispatch contract model experienced a decrease 
as the value of C1  becomes large. Basically, we can see that a very large C1  value is does not benefit the total 
expected profit. However, when the value of C1becomes large, compared with the other contract models, contract 
4 not only does not experience a decrease in expected profit, but shows a slight increase in expected profit. This 
shows that combining the two types of flexibility in a contact can prevent impact of an increasing C1  value on the 
total expected profit.  
 
5.1.4 Affect of specialized labor cost (C2 ) on contract 4  
 As the value of C 2  increase, the total expected profit of both temporary work agency and the user firm will 
decrease. From this we can see that an increase in the value of C 2 will increase the cost of the user firm. However, 
from the temporary work agency’ s standpoint, they don’ t necessarily gain any benefit. The main reason for this is 
because within the contract, the user firm has the period adjustment and total adjustment flexibility. The higher the 
value of C 2  the lower the first time order quantity for specialized laborer from the user firm.  This will lower the 
expect profit for the temporary work agency, hence the total expected profit will also be lower.  
 
Comparison of the four types of dispatch contract model 
 The total expected profit for each of the four contracts will decrease with the increase of the value of C 2 . We 
can see that under the condition where all other criteria remain unchanged, an increase in the value of C 2  not only 
increases cost for the user firm, but also reduces the order quantity for specialized laborers. This results in the 
reduction of profits for the temporary work agency, another word, when cost for specialized laborers increase, no 
matter what type of contract, it is a detriment to both the temporary work agency and the user firm. 
 
5.2 Experimental design 
 This section will discuss the impact of different parameter combinations on the user firm, temporary work 
agency, and total expected profit using experimental design methodology. By focusing on the combined period 
quantity adjustment and total quantity adjustment contract, we will further identify noticeable factors affecting 
expected profit. 
(1) No matter what type of parameter combination, the expected profit for contract 1 is always the lowest.  All 
other contract shows an increase in total achieved profits.  
(2) When the period quantity adjustment flexibility value  is very small (value is 1~8), the expected profit for 
contract 2 is clearly lower than when the value of  is very large (value is 9~16). Therefore giving user firm 
very large period quantity adjustment flexibility will increase the expected profit of the user firm, hence 
increase the total expected profit.  
(3) When the total quantity adjustment flexibility value  is very small (value is 1~4, 9~12), the total expected 
profit for contract 3 is clearly lower than when the value of  is very large (value is 5~8, 13~16). Hence, 
we find that under the condition where the contract only considers total quantity adjustment flexibility, the

Abstract: Monitoring of human resources in science and technology (HRST) is a key point 
in national competitiveness because high quality human resources are fundamental to 
national development and related technological and economical growth. This study 
discusses the concept of HRST and related measures, and compares productivity changes in 
a sample of 39 nations. This work is based on 323 criteria from the competitiveness index 
presented in the 2007 World Competitiveness Yearbook, where 10 specific HRST 
productivity criteria were selected. The ten criteria were used to measure productivity and 
changes in productivity of national HRST through data envelopment analysis, in which 
Malmquist productivity indexes were calculated and decomposed into two sources of 
productivity change. Data analysis indicates that technical change explains most of the 
productivity fluctuations observed during the period. The analytical results reveal a 
benchmark that nations aiming to improve themselves in terms of national HRST 
productivity can use as a guideline.  
Keywords: human resources in science and technology (HRST); productivity change; data 
envelopment analysis (DEA); Malmquist index 
 
1  Introduction 
In the knowledge-based economy, government develop technology industry has become 
critical to driving national economic development. Technological innovation has replaced 
traditional productive factors as the engine of economic growth. Innovation is based on 
technologists and scientists, and this human capital has become the driving force of national 
competitive advantage. Unfortunately, most analyses of national competitiveness fail to 
reflect the competitiveness of national human resources in science and technology (HRST). 
Productivity of HRST is an important concern for HRST competitiveness. The ability to 
assess HRST thus has become an important issue.

efficiency of input factor to propose an improved productivity method. Productivity is 
quotient resulting from dividing output factor by production factor (OECD, 2001). Fabricant 
(1959) believes that productivity measures a country’s ability to transform resources into 
goods. Kendrick (1977) and Geisler (1995) note that productivity represents the relationship 
between the input and output factors of goods and labor. By combining the viewpoints from 
all of the literature, productivity can be broadly defined as the “ratio of all input factors to 
the output factors.”  
     This study develops three HRST productivity output factors which are immediate, 
intermediate, and ultimate output. Geisler (1995) used a performance index to evaluate 
R&D output that divided output into two categories: immediate and intermediate output.  
An immediate output refers to products that have made it through the R&D stage but have 
not yet made it to market, such as: publications and patents. On the other hand, the 
intermediate output can improve the performance index or commercialized items, such as 
new products. Roessner (1996) point out that High-Tech exports can be used as measure 
indicators of High-Tech competitiveness. Rubsenstein and Geisler (1988) and Schmied 
(1987) not only use immediate output and intermediate output to measure output 
performance but also add measurement of ultimate output, which are those things of value 
to the economy and society, such as improved productivity and increase economic growth. 
This study uses five indicators to evaluate output factors. The immediate factor has three 
indications, including: scientific articles, patents granted to residents, securing patents 
abroad. The indicator of intermediate factor is High-Tech exports. The indicator of ultimate 
output is basic research enhances long-term economic development. 
 
4  Methodology 
This study identified HRST productivity indicators based on the above literature review.  
These indicators panel data come from the 2007 World Competitiveness Yearbook which is 
time series data spanning from the period of 1995 to 2007. The most recent 6 years of data 
is used for each of the indicator panel. Because the DEA approach cannot be used if data is 
missing, the latest yearly data are substituted in case of missing data.  This study did not 
analyze nations where large quantities of data were missing. Although 2007 The World 
Competitiveness Yearbook included 55 nations and regional economies, this study selected 
39 nations as a sample for analyzing productivity change in HRST. Table 1 lists descriptive 
section details the computation of Malmquist productivity indexes and their decomposition 
using non-parametric techniques. The sequence of linear programs is described as follows. 
    The Malmquist productivity index is the ratio of two distance functions pertaining to 
distinct time periods (Caves et al., 1982). Productivity level can be measured using the 
relationship between the inputs employed and the outputs obtained. The relative 
productivity index must be defined as the ratio between the absolute productivity index of 
the nation in question and that of the benchmark nation (González and Gascón, 2004). This 
relative productivity index can be defined as:

 This study uses distance functions to calculate the RP index. González and Gascón 
(2004) use the distance function to indicate the maximum proportion by which the output 
vector can be expended, while maintaining a constant input vector. The value of the distance 
function for a nation can be computed by solving the following linear program:

5  Results  
5.1 Technical and scales efficiency scores 
Table 2 summarizes 39 national technical and scales efficiency scores during the most 
recent six years of 2007 IMD World Competitiveness time series data. The table 3 shows the 
six year average of the technical efficiency score computed under constant returns to 
scale(DC) and variable returns to scale(DV), and the residual efficiency score(SE). The 
results indicate that the technical efficiencies of Chile, China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, 
New Zealand, Switzerland, Thailand, and USA are 1. Five of these nine nations are located 
in the Asia-Pacific, showing that the Asia-Pacific region has a larger technical efficiency 
value. Additionally, it is clear that the conditions for a nation to be Pareto-Optimal are an 
efficiency score equal to 1. Therefore these nine nations can be adopted as a benchmark. 
The remaining 30 nations show technical efficiency of less than 1, indicating that 30 nations 
are ineffective. Hence, these ineffective nations can improve their efficiency by observing 
the resource allocation practices of benchmark nations and their output performance.  .

decrease in technological innovation (known as technology decrease). 
    To observe the decomposition of the Malmquist index, listed in Table3. The nation 
with the biggest increase in efficiency change (EC) was Brazil, with an EC increase of 9.5%. 
Furthermore, Italy had the largest decrease in EC, at 7.7%.  China had largest increase in 
technical change (TC), with an increase of 14.1%. Additionally Malaysia had largest 
decrease in TC, at 6.4%. Argentina had largest increase in pure technical efficiency change 
(PTEC), with a PTEC increase of 11.5%. Italy had the largest decrease in PTEC, at 9.9%. 
Portugal had largest increase in scale efficiency change (SEC), with a SEC increase of 4.7%. 
Finally Argentina had larges decrease in SEC, at 6.3 %. 
 
6  Concluding remarks 
While using Malmquiest productivity index, besides identifying influences on the 
change in HRST productivity for each nation, this study identifies the change in efficiency 
and technological improvements as the reasons for productivity growth. Based on EC and 
TC analysis, the reasons for productivity growth of individual nations can be deduced when 
EC can be further broken down into PTEC and SEC. Research result indicates that technical 
change explains most nations of the productivity fluctuations observed period. 
 Among the fastest developing Asian nations, Singapore and Hong Kong showed an 
increase in productivity due to technological improvements. Korean and Taiwan showed a 
decrease in productivity due to decline in efficiency. We see that nations should emphasize 
technological improvement during their economic growth phase. However, once their 
technology matures, the focus should be redirected to increasing efficiency in order to 
continue their growth.
