phase, or restrict the disturbances to be in a special class
of time functions.
In this project, a previously proposed state space
disturbance observer design (Johnson, 1971 & 1975;
Hostetter & Meditch, 1973) will first be reviewed. Since
its original design requires information of disturbance
model, its application is limited. This project proposes
a re-design of this disturbance observer based on the
finding that the structure of this previous disturbance
observer is analogous to that of an H∞ feedback con-
trol system. By taking advantage of this analogy, this
project proposes a new frequency shaping design for the
disturbance observer. The new frequency shaping de-
sign does not require disturbance model information,
and can apply to a much larger class of disturbances
than the original design. It takes into account both the
estimation tracking ability and the measurement noise
sensitivity. The new design can be easily carried out
using standard H∞ control design tools. The work in
Wang & Tomizuka (2004) utilizes H∞ optimization for
the design of DOB. The unknown input observer in Ha-
yar, Zasadzinski, & Darouach (1995) is also based on
a frequency domain design. However, they apply to
minimum-phase systems only, while the frequency shap-
ing design in this paper is not restricted to minimum-
phase systems or relative-degree-one systems.
2 Conventional State Space DOB
Design
Consider an MIMO linear time-invariant system subject
to unknown disturbance excitation,
x˙(t) = Ax(t) +Bu(t) +Gd(t) (1)
y(t) = Cx(t) + n(t)
where x ∈ Rn is the unknown system state, y ∈ Rp
the measured system output, u ∈ Rm the control input,
d ∈ Rp an unknown disturbance, and n ∈ Rp the mea-
surement noise. The input-output representation of the
system is given by
y = G(s)u+ P (s)d+ n, G(s) = C(sI −A)−1B, (2)
P (s) = C(sI −A)−1G.
To avoid unstable cancellation in the transfer function
P (s), one needs the following assumption.
Assumption A1 : The pair (A,C) is observable, and
(A,G) controllable.
Assumption A2 : The number of output y should be
no less than that of disturbance d. In this paper, they
are assumed to be equal. Hence, P (s) is a square matrix
transfer function.
The problem of disturbance observer design is to on-
line estimate the unknown disturbance d from output
measurement y and control input u. No preview of the
output y is necessary. In this section, one will review a
state space disturbance observer design (Johnson, 1971
& 1975; Hostetter & Meditch, 1973) that was originally
proposed in the state space setting. This design can
simultaneously estimate the system state x and the un-
known disturbance d from the signals u and y if a distur-
bance model, as stated in Assumption A3, is available.
Note that this Assumption 3 will be waived in the new
disturbance observer design in the next section.
Assumption A3 : d is generated from an autonomous
dynamic system of order r,
z˙(t) = Fz(t), d(t) = Hz(t), (3)
where z ∈ Rr is the unknown disturbance state, and
system matrices F ∈ Rr×r and H ∈ Rp×r are known a
priori. Examples of such disturbance d include the poly-
nomial time functions with unknown coefficients, and
sinusoidal time functions with known frequencies.
One can combine the disturbance model (3) with the
system model (1) to form an expanded system,[
x˙(t)
z˙(t)
]
=
[
A GH
0 F
] [
x(t)
z(t)
]
+
[
B
0
]
u(t)(4)
y(t) =
[
C 0
] [ x(t)
z(t)
]
+ n(t).
If this expanded system is observable, a Luenberger ob-
server can be constructed for the expanded system to
estimate the state x, z, and hence the disturbance d,[ ˙ˆx(t)
˙ˆz(t)
]
=
[

L1
L2
]
(y − Cxˆ), (5)
dˆ(t) =
[

] [ xˆ(t)
zˆ(t)
]
.
where the upper observer feedback gain L1 and the lower
observer feedback gain L2 are chosen based on the eigen-
value assignment design or the Kalman filter design to
ensure convergence of the state estimation error, and
hence the disturbance estimation error. Such a design
provides a simple and accurate solution to the distur-
bance estimation problem, nevertheless, it applies to
very limited classes of disturbance functions such as the
polynomial time functions or sinusoidal time functions.
2
troller C(s) should be chosen so that the sensitivity
function S1(s) = (1 + C(s)P (s))−1 is small over the
frequency range of d, and the high frequency gain of
T2(s) = (1 + C(s)P (s))−1C(s) is suppressed over the
high frequency range of n. Such frequency shaping de-
sign of S1(s) and T2(s) has been studied thoroughly in
the control area. An efficient and systematic way to de-
sign S1(s) and T2(s) is the H∞ control design (Zhou,
Doyle, & Glover, 1996), which ensures closed-loop sta-
bility as well as performance in the frequency domain.
Note that equation (11) in the disturbance rejection
control problem in Figure 1 is exactly the same as the
disturbance estimation error equation (7) in the distur-
bance observer problem. This reveals a parallelism be-
tween the input disturbance rejection control problem in
Figure 1 and the disturbance observer problem treated in
this Section. Both problems address the shaping design
of the same transfer functions S1(s) and T2(s). The ob-
jective of this section is to take advantage of this paral-
lelism to create a new design methodology for the state
space disturbance observer (6). The new state space
disturbance observer design, which is described below,
will be carried out in the frequency domain using the
standard H∞ control design tools.
Design Procedure Step I : One can incorporate the
internal modelling principle (Chen, 1999) into the dis-
turbance observer design. If it is known that part of the
disturbance signal has a generating polynomial E(s).
Then, set an expanded system to be
P¯ (s) =
1
E(s)
× P (s), (12)
where P (s) is the system transfer function in (2). For
example, if the disturbance d contains an unknown DC
component and a linearly drifting term, one can set
E(s) = s2, and the internal modelling principle design
will ensure that the proposed disturbance estimate dˆ can
accurately estimate this DC component and the linearly
drifting term. One then set the filter C(s) to be
C(s) = C¯(s)× 1
E(s)
, (13)
where C¯(s) is to be found from design step II below.
Design Procedure Step II : According to Theorem
1, d˜ = S1(s)d− T2(s)n, where
S1(s) = (1 + C(s)P (s))−1 = (1 + C¯(s)
1
E(s)
P (s))−1
= (1 + C¯(s)P¯ (s))−1, (14)
T2(s) = (1 + C¯(s)P¯ (s))−1C¯(s)
1
E(s)
. (15)
The design task has two missions through the choice of
the design filter C¯(s). The first mission is to achieve
accurate disturbance estimation by shaping S1(s) to al-
most zero over the frequency range of d. The second
mission is to suppress the high frequency gain of T2(s) so
as to reduce the sensitivity of disturbance observer with
respect to measurement noise n. To achieve this, con-
sider S1(s) and T2(s) in (14) and (15), and performs an
H∞ frequency shaping design to find C¯(s), with mixed
optimization index
‖
[
W1(s)S1(s),
W2(s)T2(s)
]
‖∞, (16)
where W1(s) is a weighting function aiming to lower
the gain of S1(s) over the frequency range of d, and
W2(s) a weighting function aiming to suppress the high
frequency gain of T2(s). In case that the level of mea-
surement noise is low, one can perform anH∞ frequency
shaping design to find C¯(s) with a different optimization
index
‖W1(s)S1(s)‖∞. (17)
The above design procedures generate a C¯(s) that
stabilizes the closed-loop transfer function (1 +
C(s)P (s))−1 = (1 + C¯(s)P¯ (s))−1. If the dimension of
the generated C¯(s) is too high, one may perform model
reduction (Zhou & Doyle, 1998) to obtain a reduced-
order C¯(s).
Design Procedure Step III : Use equation (13) to
find the filter C(s) from C¯(s). The design parame-
ters of the disturbance observer (6), F , H, L1(= GJ),
L2, and J can then be determined from any state
space realization of the transfer function matrix C(s) =
H(sI − F )−1L2 + J .
Conventional Luenberger observer uses static out-
put feedback Ly˜ to stabilize the state estimation er-
ror dynamics: ˙˜x = Ax˜ − Ly˜, where x˜ = x − xˆ and
y˜ = y − Cxˆ = Cx˜. It is interesting to note that the
observer proposed in this paper uses dynamic output
feedback to stabilize the error dynamics. This can be
seen as follows. The state estimation error dynamics for
the proposed observer is derived in (10),
˙˜x = Ax˜+G(d− dˆ), dˆ = C(s)y˜,
where C(s) = H(sI −F )−1L2 + J . The above equation
is similar to the governing equation of a control system
(A,G) with system state x˜, output y˜, control variable
dˆ, and an input disturbance d. The proposed control
variable dˆ = C(s)y˜ uses dynamic output feedback in-
stead of the static output feedback to stabilize the error
4
0. The design parameters F , H, L2, J can be obtained
from a state space realization of C(s).
The time response simulation is performed with a
4’th order Runge-Kutta’s algorithm with fixed time step
1.5×10−4 second. Figure 2 shows the time response for
the proposed disturbance observer, with the solid line
representing the true disturbance d, and the dash line
the disturbance estimate dˆ, which is able to track d ac-
curately. Figure 3 shows the state variable x5 and its
estimate xˆ5; it is seen that even though x5 is explod-
ing, its estimate xˆ5 still converges to x5. Figure 4 shows
the exponential decaying overall state estimation error
norm ‖x− xˆ‖ versus time.
4 Conclusions
The project proposes a re-design of a previous state
space disturbance observer. By a proper choice of the
design parameter L1 = GJ in (6), the disturbance ob-
server design problem is skillfully transformed into a
disturbance rejection control problem. The H∞ fre-
quency shaping control design can then be easily ap-
plied to shape the proposed disturbance observer in the
frequency domain. Such a frequency shaping design has
many advantages. First, the new design applies to the
most general class of disturbances as long as the dis-
turbance’s Laplace transform exists. Second, the pro-
posed state space disturbance observer design applies to
minimum-phase as well as non-minimum-phase systems.
Third, the new design applies to both continuous-time
systems and discrete-time systems. Fourth, the new de-
sign takes into account not only the estimation tracking
ability, but also sensitivity with respect to measurement
noise. Finally, it is shown that the proposed state space
disturbance observer can be successfully employed in
the robust feedback control of a system subject to un-
modelled dynamics and unknown disturbances. Note
that other than the robust control application, the pro-
posed disturbance observer can also find applications in
fault detection and diagnosis for linear dynamics sys-
tems (Chen & Patton, 1999).
