Abstract 
 
In this three years research program, the micro temperature sensor was used to 
measure the temperature and the heat transfer effect in microchannels heated by the 
micro heater with the µPIV flow field measurements.  
 
Several conditions (listed below) had been changed in order to examined the heat 
transfer mechanism and try to find the better way to enhance the heat transfer in the 
second year.  
 
1. Different working mediums, such as ethanol and methyl alcohol.  
2. Different cross-section shape in the microchannel. 
3. Different surface characteristics(hydrophilic / hydrophobic) in the mini-channel and 
microchannels.  
 
Traditionally, the flow in the tube is driven by pressure gradient, but in the 
microstructure, it can not sustain pressure which is too tremendous. Therefore, this 
work had been discussed and alternation means looked for a way to drive the flow in 
the microchannel, and, therefore, the electrokinetic (electroosmotic) effect with 
different working mediums ( such as TAE、TBE、KCl、NaCl which are frequently used 
in biotechnology) in microchannels has been used and examined in the present work. 
 
Keywords : microchannel、micro sensor、µPIV、electroosmotic flow(EOF)

研究目的 
 
微渠道目前雖已廣泛被運用在各微元件之中，但對於渠道內微流體的各項熱
傳特性與流動特性，卻存有許多爭議。在目前對於微渠道內的流場現象，已可借
由 µPIV進行量觀測且本實驗室也已成功利用 µPIV量測出微渠道內流場的實際
狀況。但在熱場及壓力分佈方面，雖已有不少文獻發表，但大多是以數值模擬的
方法進行。礙於微渠道尺寸過於細小，故無法將一般市面上現有的溫度感測器和
壓力計直接埋設在微渠道內，唯一可行的解決辦法只有利用微機電製程技術的方
法，直接將微加熱器、微溫度感測器及微壓力感測器埋在微渠道內並以等熱通量
或等壁溫度的方式對微渠道加熱，再藉由所埋設的微溫度感測器及微壓力感測器
量測其不同位置的溫度及壓力變化分佈；藉以更清楚瞭解微渠道內之流/熱場變
化現象，且同時與數值模擬進行比較。 
 
但由於將微感測器埋入微渠道內的製程較為複雜且有可能會造成微流場結
構的破壞而影響實驗的準確性，因此本計畫希望能更進一步的以非接觸式
(non-intrusive)的光學量測方法，利用微雷射誘發螢光技術(µLIF)量測出微渠道內
的溫度及濃度分佈情況。  
 
另一方面在了解微渠道內流、熱場及溫度、壓力分佈後，本計畫將更進一步
的改變微渠道表面性質及截面幾何形狀來進行微渠道內熱傳增強效果的探討。 
最後本實驗將以電壓驅動流體的方式來代替傳統壓力驅動流體並就電滲
(electroosmotic)效應來研究這類流動之物理現象及探討在二種不同驅動方式之
下，流體在微渠道內的各種現象的差異。 
 
  
 2
 
2001年 Baroncini等人 [10]，利用薄膜沉積的方式，於氣體感測器旁製作一
微型白金薄膜加熱器，通以微小電流，使它達到加熱之目的。並對氣體感測器進
行各項測量，研究氣體各項性質與溫度之關係。 
 
2002年 Stroock等人[11]，在 200µm的微渠道中，製作類似魚脊溝槽的混合
器(SHM, Staggered herringbone mixer)，利用壓力驅動流體(0<Re<100)，從斷面觀
察發現流線會產生旋轉，產生混沌流(chaotic flow)，讓流體以拉伸(stretching)、
摺疊(folding)…等方式，提升混合的速度。另外，發現當流速即雷諾數(Reynolds 
number)越大，混合長度亦相對增長，並且正比於自然對數培克數(ln(Pe))。 
 
2002年 Johnson等人[12]，利用紫外光準分子雷射(UV Excimer laser)，在 T
型微流道中，做出排列方式不同的溝槽，利用電滲驅動流體，雷諾數(Reynolds 
number)範圍在(0.033<Re<0.45)，發現當雷諾數越大時，混合效率越差；而混合
效率隨著溝槽排列方式越複雜，則能得到較好的混合效果。 
 
2002年，Sinton等人 [13]等人以間接量測電流的方式，分別將化學電解液
TAE及 TBE之平均速度算出，進而推論出此兩種電解液之電滲移動性
（electroosmotic mobility），並發現流體之質量流率與所外的電壓呈線性關係 
 
2003年，Maynes 與Webb [14][15]針對兩大平板和圓管，外加電位梯度趨
動，假設流體到達全展，分別對動量和能量方程式的進行解析，其解析解結果顯
示出，當 debye length遠小於平板或圓管的特徵長度時，電滲流動的速度曲線，
近似於一個塊狀（slug）分佈。 
 
2003年 Wang等人[16]，在混合器中，置入方形阻塊，發現阻塊數目越多、
阻塊擺設角度約 45度、流道寬與阻塊寬比約 0.8…等等因素，可以得到較佳的混
合效果。 
 
2003年 Maynes和 Webb [17]探討電滲流在大平板及圓管中，在等壁邊熱通
量及等壁溫等不同的條件下之熱傳分析。其所解出來的解析解適用於熱全展、水
力全展、穩態之假設條件。文獻中他們探討不同尺寸變化以及不同熱邊界條件下
對於紐賽數（Nusselt number）之影響。結果發現溫度分佈以及紐賽數受到渠道
水力直徑大小和熱源所佔的體積大小具有極大之影響力。其中，當電雙層厚度與
流道尺寸相當時（固定渠道尺寸），焦耳熱效應將會變得非常明顯，且渠道內溫
度梯度更益明顯。 
 
2003年 Tang 等人[18]所進行的數值研究中，主要探討焦耳熱效應對電滲流
 4
 
2005年 Lee等人[24]，利用螢光顯微鏡，觀察螢光劑(Rhodamine B)在 T型
漸縮漸擴微混合器內的混合情形，並且改變流道的縮擴比與角度，發現高縮擴比
的混合器，能有較好的混合效果，而角度的改變對於混合的影響則不大。 
 
2006年 Fu等人[25]，利用微影化學蝕刻，製作出阻塊交錯與單邊排列的混
合器，並利用 CFD軟體進行數值模擬，發現阻塊交錯的混合器效果優於單邊排
列的混合器。 
 
2006年 Hoffmann等人[26]，利用 µLIF 與 MPIV量測技術，觀察流體間在
T型微混合器中濃度的分布情形，並且利用混合指數判別混合的品質與效率。 
 
2006年 Hsieh等人[27]利用微質點影像測速儀（MPIV），探討四種不同溶
液，在不同之外加電場強度下，對電滲流所產生之影響。本實驗速度量測部份，
使用未經表面氧化處理的 PDMS渠道量測追蹤質點的電泳速度，而總和速度則
是在 Brosilicate glass毛細管內量測獲得，最後經由理論式可以計算出電滲流在
Brosilicate glass毛細管內之速度。實驗結果顯示，當外加電場強度（Ex）大於 15 
kV/m時，會因為焦耳熱效應所產生的溫度，使得速度呈現非線性的成長。最後，
並建立出獨創之速度關係式。 
 
2006年 Tang等人[28]利用微質點影像測速儀（MPIV）及雷射誘發微螢光
（µLIF）等量測技術，探討在不同電解液濃度下對焦耳熱效應所產生之影響，並
與數值模擬之結果做一比較。實驗結果顯示，當電解液之濃度越高，焦耳效應所
產生的溫度效應越明顯。令外，本研究採用不同材質的上蓋，分別有 PDMS及
glass兩種，以 PDMS的焦耳熱效應最明顯。此外，由於焦耳熱效應造成電滲流
形不再呈現平板狀，使得微晶片檢體傳輸過程會產生延散現象（Dspersion）。本
文獻之實驗結果與模擬結果相當契合。 
 
2007年 Chen等人[29]，利用數值模擬波浪型微流道內的混合，發現波浪型
側塊振幅越高，能夠增加與流體的接觸表面積，使得混合效果越好。另外，改變
流道表面的性質，模擬異質性的表面，亦有良好的混合效果。

2. 微渠道的製作 
 
本計畫所製作之微渠道(微混合器)，實驗所製作之微混合器，利用 SU-8
厚膜負光阻微影製程技術，製作為微混合器的母模，再利用矽膠 PDMS灌注
翻模，得到所設計的微混合器，製程步驟如<圖 2>所示。 
 
3. 微渠道壁邊親水性(hydrophilic)及疏水性(hydrophobic)的改變 
 
本實驗是採用紫外光臭氧清洗機（UV/ozone cleaner）對 PDMS表面進行
氧電漿(Oxygen Plasma)的活化處理，使得原本為疏水性(hydrophobic)的表面
變成親水性(hydrophilic)。 
 
其原理主要是將 PDMS進行氧電漿(Oxygen Plasma)表面活化處理時，會
將 PDMS表面疏水性(hydrophobic)的甲基分子(CH3-Group)取代為親水性
(hydrophilic)的氫氧基(OH-Group)，如<圖 3>所示，經過活化處理之 PDMS表
面則會變為極度親水之性質[30]。 
 
4. 微渠道內速度、溫度及濃度的量測 
 
      本實驗採用 Dantec公司所製造之微質點影像測速儀（Micrometer 
resolution Particle Image Velocimetry）及雷射誘發微螢光（Micro Laser-Induced 
Fluorescence），分別進行速度場及溫度(濃度)場之量測，簡稱 µPIV及 µLIF，
<如圖 4所示>。 
 
µPIV系統乃是利用流體流動時，追蹤質點會伴隨著流體移動，經由影像
拍攝分析，進一步描繪出流動行為。在本實驗中，選取 0.93 µm(濃度約為 2 x 108 
particles mL-1)螢光質點（Duke Scientific Corp.）作為追蹤質點，螢光質點之最佳
激發波長（Excitation peak）為 542 nm，最佳放射波長（Emission peak）為 612 nm。
實驗中，我們將螢光質點摻雜於工作流體中，螢光質點會跟隨的工作流體流動方
向移動。如圖 4所示，就整體概念而言，實驗中我們在兩個不同的時間點（△t = 
t2 – t1）拍攝兩張照片（Double frame），再經由影像處理及數學方法來比對這兩
張影像中螢光質點的移動距離及方向（ ds
K
），最後經由V ds / t= ∆JK K 之概念，便可
以獲得完整之向量場分布。 
 
µLIF系統乃是利用螢光染劑（Fluorescent dye）特有的性質來完成溫度場的
量測，其放射出來的螢光強度會隨著溫度的升高而降低，我們利用這樣的特性來
達到一個全域的溫度場量測 [31]。在本實驗中，我們選取 Rhodamine B
（Sigma-Aldrich Corp.）為螢光染劑，此螢光染劑之最佳激發波長（Excitation 
peak）為 526nm，最佳放射波長（Emission peak）為 580 nm。µLIF所使用的螢
光染劑放射出來的強度與下列幾項因素有關：

結果與討論 
     
    綜合本三年計畫的執行內容，主要將所研究成果分為以下三個主題，並分別
敘述其研究成果。 
 
1. 電滲流於微渠道中速度及溫度量測之實驗研究 
2. 微渠道中具表面粗糙物之被動式混合增強研究 
3. 親/疏水性微渠道之對流熱傳效果研究 
 
1. 電滲流於微渠道中速度及溫度量測之實驗研究 
 
電滲流之流場量測 
 
本實驗採用MPIV技術進行速度場之量測。圖 6(a)乃是 25mM硼酸緩衝液於
外加電場強度 5kV/m之流場可視化，測試微渠道為 treated PDMS材質，故在此
微渠道內量測到的速度是為總和速度（電滲＋電泳）。圖 6(b)乃利用 µPIV軟體的
分析方法，將圖 6(a)之原始圖，經一連串的分析，進一步得到電滲之流場分佈。
由圖 6(b)可看到，當流體流動達到穩態、全展的情況下，電滲流呈現平板狀（Slug）
之流形。且於進口區域發現電滲流的進口長度很短[32]，遠低於 µPIV 系統的最
小空間解析度，所以在此處難以界定進口長度大小。此外，無論是由儲水槽到渠
道進口區域或是渠道出口區域到儲水槽，這兩個區域均呈現拋物線之流形。最主
要是因為在此區域會產生一個壓力場[32, 33]，會使得流體產生一個吸入效應，
此實驗結果與 Yang 等人[32]數值模擬結果相符合。ㄧ般而言，進口區域在生醫
晶片之應用常常是作為注射（Injection）試劑的主要通道。雖然說電滲流在微渠
道中的流形為平板狀，因而降低延散效應的產生。但在渠道進口區域所產生的吸
入效應，將無法避免延散效應的產生，甚至是非常明顯的。故注射技術（Injection 
technology）亦成為實驗室晶片的重要研究課題之一。 
 
圖 7進一步分析於微渠道進口區域、中間區域及出口區域之速度分佈曲線與
電場強度之關係圖。隨著外加電場強度的增加，電滲速度分佈曲線不再呈現平板
狀。造成拋物線流形的主要原因來自於焦耳熱效應所產生的非均勻溫度場[22]，
此部份之結果將於下節之熱場量測部分呈現。於進口及出口區域隨著焦耳熱效應
越明顯，所呈現的流形是內凹的；中間區域隨著電場強度增加，所呈現的流形是
外凸的。無論是外凸或是內凹流形，均無法避免延散效應的產生。故於實驗室晶
片之應用及分析並不樂見焦耳熱效應之產生。 
 
就傳統電滲理論而言，隨著外加電場強度的增加，電滲速度會呈線性增加。
圖 8為中間區域之平均速度與電場強度之關係圖，從圖中發現電滲速度與外加電
場強度呈現非線性的成長。主要是受到焦耳效應的影響，造成渠道內部升溫，改
變流體原有的性質，如黏滯係數、介電係數等[27]，因此破壞了傳統理論所認定
之線性關係。另外，並將實驗結果與 Hsieh等人[27]做比較，在渠道寬度為 200 µm
的 case中本實驗非線性成長的速度比 Hsieh等人[27]的結果快，最主要是因為渠
 10
 
圖 14 為電滲移動率與緩衝液濃度之關係圖，圖中顯示隨著緩衝液濃度的增
加，電滲移動率會隨之降低。並將此結果與 Sadr等人[36]做比較，除了硼酸緩衝
液與先前文獻具有相近之變化斜率，NaCl 溶液濃度變化之影響似乎不如硼酸緩
衝液大。主要因素除了使用的溶液種類及 pH值不同外，還有一個可能因素是來
自於濃度表示方式跟真正實際電解液中的離子濃度是有些差距的。就 NaCl電解
液與硼酸緩衝液而言，同樣在濃度 10mM的情況下，NaCl電解液僅只有加入NaCl
固體藥品，而硼酸緩衝液除了加入 NaCl固體藥品之外，還需加入對應克數的硼
酸化學藥品，詳見<表一>。因此硼酸緩衝液內的離子數目會比純 NaCl電解液來
的高，故在相同的濃度變化表示下，實際上硼酸緩衝液的離子濃度變化是比 NaCl
電解液來的多。所以，真正影響濃度變化斜率應是來自於離子濃度的變化。 
 
圖 15(a)為電滲移動率與深寬比之關係圖，圖中顯示當深寬比越大，電滲移
動率隨之增加。光從電滲移動率來看，很難看出真正影響電滲速度的因素。所以
進一步利用相關公式扣除介電係數及黏滯係數等容易相關性質，而得到則塔電位
與深寬比之關係圖，如圖 15 (b)。從圖中看出，當深寬比越高表面電位隨之越大。
就 0.5x TBE而言，當溶液的 pH值及濃度固定的情況下，表面電位會隨著深寬比
的改變而不同。故則塔電位除了包含有渠道表面矽醇基解離程度的資訊外，同時
也包含有電雙層厚度與渠道尺寸間之關係資訊。所以才會使得深寬比越大，電滲
移動率也隨之增加。 
 
由上述的探討可以看出，對於則塔電位的探討是相當重要的，並且只要透過
簡單的理論式 Smoluchowski 方程式便可以預測電滲的平均移動速度。在此，進
一步探討 pH值與則塔電位之關係。如圖 16所示，隨著 pH值的增加則塔電位隨
之增大，並於 pH > 8呈現趨緩的分布。此結果與 Kirby和 Hasselbrink [37]的研究
結果趨勢極為相同，由於渠道材質選擇上的不同，所以得到的結果有許些差距。 
 
為了進一步探究則塔電位與相關實驗參數之關係，將無因次參數ζ*、pC、
深寬比及 pH值關聯成一關係式[37]，如圖 17所示。 
 
ζ* = 0.028 pH1.95(H/W)0.165pC    4 ≤pH ≤ 7.5 
ζ* = 1.421 (H/W)0.165pC       7.5 < pH ≤ 10 
. 
其中 ζ*為無因次化之則塔電位[27]，其定義為 -(ze/kBT)ζ。而 pC為與渠道表
面帶電相異之離子濃度（在此為陽離子），其定義與 pH值相同為 pC = - log([C+])。 
 
由圖 17可以界定出當 pH < 7.5時，則塔電位會隨著 pH值的增加而越大。
由於主導表面解離之主要機制為 SiOH → SiO－+ H＋，根據勒沙特列原理，pH值
越低表示溶液中的 H+離子越多，反而使得矽醇基更難以解離。此外，當矽醇基
解離後，SiO－會吸引溶液中的異性離子至渠道表面附近形成一電雙層分佈，故可
以想見異性離子濃度（pC）的大小也是會影響則塔電位，此結論亦說明了於圖
14中，為何不同溶液間在相同濃度變化下會有不同的變化斜率。 
 
2. 微渠道中具表面粗糙物之被動式混合增強研究 
 
 12
分析完成側向速度分佈後，利用相關公式計算拉伸率 (Stretching rate, 
)s( 1z
−ε )，在 x=-100~900µm內，以 100µm為一單位，分 10個區域計算其區域最
大的 zε ，並取平均值得到各微混合器的平均拉伸率(Average stretching rate, 
)s( 1z
−ε )，拉伸率優劣依序為 Twr>Tcdr>Tw>Tcd>Tr>T，如圖 23 (a) 所示。得到
區域的拉伸率後，將 10 的區域所得的 zε 對時間積分，並依序累加，得到拉伸
(Stretching)，其優劣依序為 Twr> Tcdr> Tw> Tcd>Tr >T，而 T型拉伸僅發生在流
場交匯處，如圖 23 (b) 所示。 
 
濃度場觀測與分析 
 
圖 24 呈現各微混合器在 x=2100~2700µm，流速最低 Re=0.027與流速最高
Re=0.081 之 µLIF 濃度變化彩色圖，共使用 15 色表示特定濃度，深紅色為最高
濃度 1.0，淺綠色為最佳混合濃度 0.5，桃粉紅色為最低濃度 0.0。由於 Rhodamine 
B會使得阻塊染色，因此無法獲得該區域的濃度變化情形。 
 
由圖 24 可以清楚看出，所有微混合器隨著 Re 與 Pe 的增加，混合效果變
差，且混合長度變長，各微混合器混合優劣依序為 Twr>Tcdr>Tw>Tcd>Tr>T，與
優碘與去離子水的實驗結果相符。圖 24 (a) 呈現 Twr 型微混合器在三個區域
Re=0.054 的濃度分布，混合在 2300µm 的位置，就已經達到 79.69%，而到達
4500µm時，混合早已達到 90%，且越往下游，混合效果越好，因此可以証明 Twr
型微混合器能在很短的距離內，便可達到完全混合。另外，圖 25 (a) 經由實驗
觀察與部份想像，繪出 Twr型微混合器的三維流線圖，以兩種顏色代表不同的流
體，可以看出流場經過幾何變化區域時，流線會受到擠壓，產生側向速度，進而
使流體產生拉伸的現象，整體流線呈現週期的變化。 
 
利用 FlowMap 軟體的功能，在 µLIF 濃度變化彩色圖上，於所要分析的 x
位置，沿著徑向(z 方向)劃一條線，即能夠得到 z 方向的濃度分佈曲線，再將該
曲線上各點的數值帶入公式 4-5，即可得到混合效率大小。圖 25 (b)即呈現圖 25 (a)
三個區域的徑向的濃度分布圖，由於 Twr型流場受到的擾度較大，因此濃度曲線
變化較不對稱，而圖 26 則呈現 Tw 型微混合器，在不同區域不同 Re 下，徑向
濃度的變化情形，曲線大致會呈現對稱的分布，當 Re越大曲線斜率越大，代表
混合越差，而越往下游，曲線斜率則越小，代表混合越好。 
 
圖 27為各微混合器在 Re=0.054的混合效率分佈情形，除了 T型未達到完
全混合外，所有微混合器大約在 3500µm~6000µm即完成 90%以上的混合，並且
可以發現混合效率的成長速度逐漸趨緩慢，最後趨近於定值。圖 28 為各微混合
器在所有實驗條件下的無因次化混合長度，所有微混合器大約在 2000 µm~7000 
µm即完成 90%以上的混合，混合長度大小依序為 Tr >Tcd>Tw>Tcdr>Twr，以 Twr
型微混合器有最短的混合長度。 
 
關係式建立 
 
從參考文獻[11]中，可知混合長度隨著 ln(Pe)成比例變化，因此我們嘗試以
Pe與混合長度( A )作圖(如圖 29)，發現此斜線的斜率為 0.24，即代表 A與 Pe間的
 14
實驗所採用的微渠道長度(20000 µm)在本實驗所有的加熱條件下，足以到達熱全
展(thermal fully developed)。 
 
圖 34 為本實驗針對親水性(Hydrophilic)及疏水性(Hydrophobic)二種不同微
渠道在不同 Pe/Re數及 q'' =18.1 mW/mm2下，熱全展( thLe D )/速度全展( Le D )
跟 Pe/Re 之關係，從圖 34 可看出，不論在熱進口長度或速度進口長度上，親水
性(Hydrophilic)微渠道皆比疏水性(Hydrophobic)微渠道來的短，因此可從此得
知，在微渠道的熱傳性質上，壁邊為親水性(Hydrophilic)的微渠道較壁邊為疏水
性(Hydrophobic)的微渠道更容易到達穩態。 
 
    傳統上，在等熱通量(constant heat flux)下，當流體在管內到達熱全展時，Nu
值為 4.36，而在等壁溫(constant wall temperature)下，當流體在管內到達熱全展
時，Nu值為 3.66，其結果並不會因為不同的工質及進口條件(如流速及進口溫度)
而改變。為了確認此觀點在微渠道內是否正確，因此本研究針對了四種不同工質
(去離子水、甲醇、乙醇及 50 wt %去離子水/50 wt %甲醇)進行實驗，其結果如圖
35所示，從圖上可明顯看出不論是不同工質或不同條件下(不同加熱條件或不同
Pe 數)，在微渠道內當流體到達熱全展後，其 Nu 值也符合傳統熱傳現像而呈現
一定值。以本實驗的單邊加熱情況而言，在等熱通量(constant heat flux)的條件下， 
親水性(Hydrophilic)的微渠道Nu = 2.63，而在等壁溫(constant wall temperature)條
件下，親水性(Hydrophilic)的微渠道Nu = 2.49。而從圖 35可看出Wu和 Cheng [39]
所得到的結果，在 Pe < 2000時 Nu並非為一定值，會造成此結果的原因可能為
Wu和 Cheng [39]並沒有將熱進口效應考慮進去，亦或者實驗本身並未扣除在微
渠道內因為 viscous heating [51-57]所造成的實驗誤差。 
 
圖 36為親/疏水性微渠道在不同等熱通量((q'' =12.6 mW/mm2、18.1 
mW/mm2、32.3 mW/mm2 and 50.5 mW/mm2))下Nu與 Pe之關係，從圖 36結果可
看出壁邊為親水性(Hydrophilic)的微渠道的熱傳效果(Nu值)明顯的比壁邊為疏水
性(Hydrophobic)的微渠道來的好，此現象的產生在於當壁邊呈現疏水性時，壁邊
跟工質之間以微觀的角度來看並無直接接觸，而是存在一間隙(gap) [58-61]，因
此使得壁邊跟工質之間無法產生直接的熱對流，而使得熱傳較果降低。

Electroosmotic flow velocity measurements
in a square microchannel
Abstract Experiments were per-
formed using a microparticle image
velocimetry (MPIV) for 2D velocity
distributions of electroosmotically
driven flows in a 40-mm-long micro-
channel with a square cross section of
200×200 μm. Electroosmotic flow
(EOF) bulk fluid velocity measure-
ments were made in a range of
streamwise electric field strengths
from 5 to 25 kV/m. A series of seed
particle calibration tests can be made
in a 200×120×24,000-μm untreated
polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS chan-
nel incorporating MPIV to determine
the electrophoretic mobilities in
aqueous buffer solutions of 1× TAE,
1× TBE, 10 mM NaCl, and 10 mM
borate. A linear/nonlinear (due to
Joule heating) flow rate increase with
applied field was obtained and com-
pared with those of previous studies.
A parametric study, with extensive
measurements, was performed with
different electric field strength and
buffer solution concentration under a
constant zeta potential at wall for each
buffer. The characteristics of EOF
in square microchannels were thus
investigated. Finally, a composite
correlation of the relevant parameters
was developed in the form of

Introduction
Electroosmosis is a basic phenomenon experienced in all
electrophoretic separation processes. It is the flow
generated by the action of an electric field on a fluid with
a net charge, which is created by the zeta potential and
confined in the Debye layer. This basic phenomenon in the
electrokinetic transport is applied in the design of many
microfluidic devices/systems being used today [5, 8].
Applications where such phenomena play an important
role are in the cooling of microelectronics, lap-on-a-chip
diagnostic devices, and in vivo drug delivery systems. In
fact, electrically neutral liquids have a distribution of
electrical charges near a surface because of a charged
surface. This region is known as the electrical double layer
(EDL) which induced the aforementioned electrokinetic
flow. In addition, hydrophobic materials have become
increasingly attractive for use in micropatterned devices.
Thus, the flow characteristics of microfluid involving
electrokinetic phenomena and liquid slip are needed for
design and operation of microfluidics in microelectrome-
chanical systems (MEMS) devices [13].
Contrary to hydrodynamic flows, where one finds a
parabolic distribution of the flow velocities with the
maximum velocity at the center of the channel and zero
velocity at walls, electroosmotic flow (EOF) is generated
close to the wall and therefore produces a nearly uniform
(i.e., plug-like profile) velocity distribution across the
entire cross section of the channel. In most cases, the
Debye length of typical electrolytes used in microfabri-

variables and geometric parameters: (a) electric field strength,
(b) electrolyte types and concentration, and (c) channel
hydraulic diameters [1]. Finally, through dimensional anal-
ysis, the present EOF is a function of Debye number (DN),
Ex and M (in terms of ME
*), and ς*. In this study, different
electric field strength and four buffers with different ionic
strength and a fixed hydraulic diameter in a square
microchannel will be experimentally investigated.
Experimental
PDMS microchannel fabrication
There were two test structure channels used. One was a 40-
mm-long borosilicate glass channel with a square cross
section of height 200 μm manufactured by Wilmad Glass
for solution particle electrophoretic velocity and wall
electroosmotic velocity measurements, and the other was a
200 μm×120 μm×24-mm untreated polydimethyl siloxane
(PDMS) channel for particle electrophoretic mobility
measurements. The untreated PDMS channels were fab-
ricated in house at the University Microsystem Laboratory
by casting a straight open channel from PDMS methyl
acrylate and sealed with the same material. The casting
mold was made by SU-8 deep UV lithography. Based on
the paper of Duffy et al. [4], these channels were used to
measure the particle electrophoretic mobility. Detailed
SU-8 mold design and PDMS channel fabrication through
deep UV lithography can be explained as follows. The
fabrication starts with silicon wafers insulation by thermal
oxidation. The Su-8 photoresist is spin-coated at 2,000 rpm
onto silicon wafers to create masters for 30 s with 120 μm
in thickness. A mask is made out of high-solution quartz
glass printed to scale to put on the silicon wafers, and
then a UV beam (365 nm) is illuminated for a few minutes
to make a negative etched channel manifold. During the
process, the excess photoresist is peeled off from the
silicon substrate that has a negative pattern of the master.
Meanwhile, a 10:1 mixture of PDMS prepolymer was
poured onto the master and cured for 1 h at 70 °C. After
curing, the PDMS replica mold was peeled from the master.
Flat pieces of PDMS were formed by casting prepolymer
against a silicon wafer and curing. To form enclosed
channels, a PDMS replica and a PDMS flat were rinsed in
acetone as well as in ethanol and dried with argon stream.
For these two tested channels, precise information of the
channel’s dimension is extremely important for an accurate
evaluation on this EOF channel. The depth, width, and
length were measured optically with an accuracy of less
than ±0.2%. To understand the present device surface
condition, the roughness of the channel was measured
along its center with the surface profilometer. The un-
certainties for relevant geometric parameters are listed in
Table 2.
Flow system
In the present electroosmotically driven flows, a 40-mm-
long borosilicate glass square channel (Wilmad Glass,
Buena, NJ, USA) with 200×200 μm cross section is used
and has two reservoirs to supply buffer of fluorescent
particles for the channel. Before use, the microchannel and
the entire flow loop were rinsed with DI water for at least
1 h to remove any contaminants. The transparent nature of
the microchannel surfaces allowed visual examination of
the channel to ensure that no bubbles were left in the
channel. The four buffer solutions used were 1× Tris–
acetate with EDTA (TAE), 1× Tris–borate with EDTA
(TBE), 10 mM borate, and 10 mM NaCl. A schematic
diagram showing the flow channel and the auxiliary
system is given in Fig. 2. During the experiments, the
above-stated microchannel was connected to two small
reservoirs. Current data were recorded from the power
source by a personal computer-based data acquisition
system. MPIV measurements were taken through a view-
ing window at the midplane (y=0) between the two
reservoirs. The potential was applied via platinum elec-
trodes immersed in two 3-ml open reservoirs. The distance
between electrodes was 40 mm. The electric field strengths
of 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5, and 25 kV/m
were applied.

velocity of the fluid u for the present EOF is given by the
equation:
u ¼ um  uph ; (2)
where um is the total velocity of seed particles by MPIV in
borosilicate glass channels and uph is the electrophoretic
velocity of the seed particles in the untreated PDMS
channel. With respect to measurement uncertainties, the
most significant source of error is expected to be the
measurements at the wall.
Solution preparation
Changes in pH, concentration, dielectric constant, etc. due
to reactions and mixing processes make electrometric flow
hard to control. To avoid these things to happen, extreme
care should be paid in preparing the buffer solutions. The
TAE buffer 1× has a pH of 8, while the pH value of the
TBE buffer 1× is 8.3. A 10-mM borate buffer solution has a
pH value of 9.2, and the pH value of 10 mM NaCl aqueous
solution is 7. The 1× TBE was secured from biological
industry. The 1× TAE was prepared and contained 40 mM
Tris base, 40 mM glacial acetic acid, and 1 mM EDTA in
deionized water. Again, like Sinton et al. [12], although
both are termed “1×”, these buffers differ substantially in
ionic strength. In fact, it is difficult to calculate the exact
concentration of dissociated ions. This is because the
electrokinetic characterizations of these two solutions with
various solid surfaces have not been well studied and
understood as well. The electrolyte solutions of NaCl and
borate buffer were prepared by dissolving NaCl, and NaCl
and borate acid (i.e., NaCl+H3BO3) in deionized water,
respectively. The bulk liquid conductivities of the solutions
are listed in Table 1. Immediately before use, all solutions
were filtered through a 0.1-μm particle filter, and
microchannels were rinsed/cleaned with pure water.
Then, appropriate buffers were applied. The electrokinetic
potential and flow parameter ranges considered in this
experimental work are also presented in Table 1.
Results and discussions
Cross-stream velocity profiles of EOFs in a microchannel
with different buffer solutions of a hydraulic diameter
Dh=200 μm at Ex=5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kV/m are given in
Fig. 4a–d. The plug-like motion, a characteristic of EOF, is
apparent, and the velocity profiles remain fairly flat right to
the wall for each buffer for Ex≤15 kV/m; while for Ex=20
and 25 kV/m, concave-shape velocity profile happens due
to Joule heating possibly. Although the local temperature
measurements of the buffers were not made, the inlet and
outlet temperatures were still measured. The differences
seem significant as Ex>15 kV/m. A reasonable estimate (as
shown later) for the Debye length from the classical theory
[7] shows that λ≅1–3 nm for the present four buffers which
indicates an EDL thickness on the order of 10 nm. This
EDL thickness is much less than the spatial resolutions of
the present optical microscopy. Therefore, the velocity
profile near the wall may have an artifact. Such situation
was also reported by Sinton et al. [12]. Among the four
buffers under study, the borate solution has the largest
velocity at each applied electric strength Ex. Furthermore,

wall, and the other is the viscous drag in the core of the
channel. These two factors are counterbalanced. As a
result, the flow in the core of the channel has a lower
velocity as compared to those flows near the wall. Such
situation becomes more noted as the applied electric
strength increases. Moreover, the values of the streamlines
shown in Fig. 5b again indicate that a plug-like flow covers
most part of the channel cross section with a reference
value of “zero” set at the channel wall for the present study.
One of the typical images of the corresponding flow/
particle displacement at a time interval (Δt) for 1× TAE is
shown in Figs. 6a,b for untreated PDMS channel and
borosilicate glass channel, respectively. Due to a faster
movement of the fluorescent particle in Fig. 6a, the time
interval (Δt) is shorter to be one-fourth of that in Fig. 6b for
electrophoretic and EOF measurements. Generally, the
movements of electrophoretic particles can be clearly seen
in Fig. 6a as compared to those shown in Fig. 6b.

osmotic velocity for a relative higher ionic strength in the
TBE buffer was the lowest which may not be practical as
related to the microfluidic applications. However, the
present 10 mM borate buffer has the highest electroosmotic
velocity and it can reach to 0.54 mm/s at E=10 kV/m. This
would provide a competitive potential of applicability in
the context of microfluidic technologies as compared to the
two commonly used ones in chemical and biological
industry like the TAE and TBE buffers. Moreover, it
appears that the higher ionic strength would result in the
lower electroosmotic velocity for a given buffer solution.
This is because the Debye length is very small in con-
centrated ionic solutions which can also be seen in Table 1.
Moreover, the electric conductivity for these four buffers
listed in Table 1 seems to have no significant contribution
on Joule heating effect.

Abstract
Experimental studies were conducted on fully developed and steady electroosmotic flow in
rectangular microchannels where the channel height (H) to width (W) ratios are varied. The
Joule heating and its effects with the changes of the channel aspect ratio (H/W), the applied
electric field strength and the type of buffer solutions were examined and data were presented.
It is found that the presence of Joule heating and flow area change could have a great impact
on the electroosmotic flow (EOF) via the buffer solution temperature rise.

Introduction
Lab-on-a-chip (or biochip) devices have drawn much attention
recently for their ever-increasing applications in biomedical
diagnosis and analysis such as clinical detection, DNA
hybridizations and electro phoretic separation [1]. Most
microchannels in lap-on-a-chip devices have diversions in
the range of 10–100 µm. A fundamental understanding
of liquid flow through the microchannels of these
lab-on-a-chip devices has something to do with electroosmotic
flow (EOF), which is defined as the flow of an electrolyte
solution driven by an external electric field (E) through
a channel with charged surfaces. The surface charge is
created in this case by adsorption of ions from electrolyte
solution onto the channel walls. In fact, electrokinetic
pumping is the leading technology not only for driving flows
through microchannels because EOF can achieve much higher
volumetric flow rates (Q) than the pressure gradient flow, but
also the nearly uniform velocity profiles of EOF in biochemical
separations used in lab-on-a-chip devices [2] with negligible
Taylor dispersion.
In the literature, a lot of work has been done on
EOF in micro capillaries of various geometric domains [3]
such as slit parallel plate, cylindrical capillary, annulus,
elliptical pore, rectangular channels, and T and Y microchannel
structures in fully developed EOF without considering
Joule heating effect. Recent experimental measurements

Experimental details
PDMS microchannel fabrication
There were two test structure channels used. One was a 50 mm
long polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) channel treated using
the UV/ozone surface modification technique [8] with three
cross sections of 80 µm × 100 µm, 80 µm × 150 µm
and 80 µm × 200 µm for solution particle electrophoretic
velocity and wall electroosmotic velocity measurements, and
the other was the same dimension untreated PDMS channel for
particle electrophoretic mobility measurements. The treated
and untreated PDMS channels were fabricated (see figure 2 for
details) in house at the University Microsystem Laboratory by
casting a straight open channel from PDMS and sealed with the
same material. The photomasks needed are designed by using
CAD software and printed by a 10 000 dpi image setter. The
casting mold was made by SU-8 deep UV lithography. Based
on the paper of Hsieh et al [5], these channels were made and
used to measure the particle electrophoretic mobility.
For these two tested channels, precise information of
the channel’s dimensions is extremely important for accurate
evaluation. The depth, width and length were measured
optically with an accuracy of less than ±0.2%. To understand
the present device surface condition, the roughness of the
channel was measured along its center with the surface
profilometer.
Flow system
In the present electroosmotically driven flows, three 50 mm
long treated/untreated PDMS channels with different cross
sections are used and have two reservoirs (up/downstream
plenum) to supply a buffer of fluorescent particles for the
channel. Before use, the microchannel and the entire flow
loop were rinsed with DI water for at least 1 h to remove
any contaminants. The transparent nature of the microchannel
surfaces allowed visual examination of the channel to ensure
that no bubbles were left. The buffer solutions used were 0.5×,
1×, 1.5× Tris-borate with EDTA (TBE); 10 mM, 25 mM and
50 mM borate buffer; 10 mM, 25 mM and 50 mM NaCl, and
50 mM phosphate buffer with pH 4, 5 and 6. A schematic
diagram showing the flow channel and the auxiliary system is
given in figure 3. During the experiments, the above-stated
microchannel was connected to two small reservoirs. Current

and an emission peak at 612 nm (red). These particles
were surfactant free. These particles were introduced into
the microchannel and electrokinetically driven by a range of
electrical fields. Fluorescence imaging of the rhodamine B
(Sigma–Aldrich Co.) dye was performed for the temperature
µLIF measurement.
The system whose layout is also reported in figure 3 is
based on two pulsed Nd:YAG laser (New Wave Solo II, 30 mJ,
double cavity) firing on the second harmonic (green 532 nm).
The laser provides a thin sheet with the measured thickness.
The light sheet is positioned to illuminate the entire inlet, outlet
and mid-section of the channel. The laser pulse duration is
4–80 ms based on the velocity magnitude. The test system is
mounted on a movable xz stage on an inverted epifluorecent
microscope (DMILM Leica) with 10×, numerical aperture
NA = 0.25 panchromatic objective and a field view of
800 × 600 µm2. The measurement plane (i.e., object plane)
was precisely positioned relative to the test section by moving
the objective lens vertically in the y direction and by moving the
table horizontally in the x and z directions. The concentration
of fluorescent microspheres based on the interrogation volume
was 8 × 107 particles per milliliter.
The images were recorded using a Dantec 80C77 Hisense
PIV 1344 × 1024 × 12 bit interline transfer camera. A total
of five images per second were taken for each flow field with a
spatial resolution was of 32 × 32 pixels, and the interrogation
cell overlay was 50%. Ensemble averaging of 20 images
consecutively captured for 4 s was used to obtain the velocity
measurements. The calculated measurement depth of the
present MPIV is 27 µm. The present measurements were
performed in a clean room of the University Microsystem
Laboratory where the ambient temperature was controlled at
298 K. Each measurement was repeated at least three times
at a specified condition. The present measurements were
conducted at the middle region, at inlet as well as outlet regions
of the microchannel, and the flow was found to be reached
hydrodynamically fully developed at the middle region of the
microchannel.
Methodology used (for particle electrophoretic mobility
and electroosmotic velocity)
Following Duffy et al [9], the electrophoretic velocity of
the seed particles in the untreated PDMS channel of this
study with negligible electroosmotic mobility can be found
by using MPIV measurements for this untreated PDMS
channel. The total velocity of seed particles was found from
MPIV measurements for treated PDMS channels. After these
velocities have been found, the bulk averaged velocity of the
fluid u for the present EOF is given by the equation
u = u¯m − u¯ph (1)
where u¯m is the total velocity of seed particles by MPIV in
treated PDMS channels and u¯ph is the electrophoretic velocity
of the seed particles in the untreated PDMS channel.
With respect to measurement uncertainties, the most
significant source of error is expected to be the measurements
at the wall and the biggest physical error in MPIV data
is Brownian diffusion of the 1 µm tracers. Out-of-plane
Brownian diffusion causes a reduction of the signal-to-noise
ratio of the cross-correlation peak. Such error was estimated.
In addition, errors due to in-plane Brownian diffusion are
essentially eliminated by temporally averaging the results in
the steady flow. In fact, experimental errors due, for instance,
to the limiting spatial resolution of the CCD camera and errors
in determining the magnification are therefore the major source
of error in these results and found to be within ±15%.
Temperature visualization experiments
The visualization of the local fluid temperature was achieved
with the same apparatus used for flow visualization and
measurements, namely, figure 3. Instead of using a fluorescent
particle, however, the channel was filled with a solution
of rhodamine B, which is a fluorescent dye showing a
temperature-sensitive quantum yield in the range of 0–100 ◦C
[10]. Experiments were conducted with a fluorescence
microscope equipped with a long-working distance 10×
objective lens. The images were recorded using the
same equipment used for MPIV measurements. From the
captured images, the detailed temperature distribution can
be extracted. The intensity values of the captured images
then were converted to temperature using the intensity versus
temperature calibration [7]. The calibration of the intensity of
temperature was made for each solution.
Solution preparation
The TBE buffers, 0.5×, 1× and 1.5×, have a pH of 8.3. The
10 mM, 25 mM and 50 mM borate buffer solutions have a pH
value of 9.2, and the pH value of 10 mM, 25 mM, and 50 mM
NaCl aqueous solution is 7. The 1× TBE was secured from
biological industry. Immediately before use, all solutions were
filtered through a 0.1µm particle filter and microchannels were
rinsed/cleaned with pure water. Then, appropriate buffers
were applied. The electrokinetic potential and flow parameter
ranges considered in this experimental work are also presented
in table 2.
Results and discussion
The microchannel used has a length of 50 000 µm with three
different aspect ratios (H/W) of 0.4, 0.53 and 0.8. In both
temperature and flowfield measurements, several points closed
the two ends (inlet and outlet) and were studied in the middle
region of the channel. At each point, five different electric
field strengths of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 kV m−1 were applied.
Experiments are performed for three microchannels under
different pH values, solution concentration, buffer type and
applied electric field strength to study the Joule heating effect
on electroosmotic flow in different cross section rectangular
microchannels.
Detailed temperature distribution due to Joule heating
Following Tang et al [3], the time for the temperature field to
reach its steady state is very short (<300 ms). Therefore
the detailed temperature distribution obtained from µLIF

temperature rises by estimation are higher than those
visualized by µLIF measurements. The discrepancy between
the measurements and estimations with the heat loss deduction

Figure 6(a) shows the effect of the buffer concentration on
the average temperature distribution at the middle region due
to Joule heating in a 200 µm microchannel. It can be seen in
figure 6(a) that the buffer concentration does play an important
role in heat transfer because it has a significant influence on
temperature distribution as Ex increases especially for 50 mM
borate buffer; the temperature can reach up to 80 ◦C due to
a nonlinear increase at Ex = 25 kV m−1. In addition, the
temperature rise due to Joule heating seems to be dependent
on the channel hydraulic diameter (Dh) as evidenced by
figure 6(b) in which the temperature in a large channel (Dh =
114.3 µm) is significantly higher than those in small channels
(Dh = 104.3 µm and 88.9 µm) in 50 µM borate buffer. This
is perhaps because as the channel hydraulic diameter becomes
larger, the surface area to volume ratio becomes smaller,
resulting in a lower ratio of heat dissipation (due to surface
effect) to the Joule heating generation (based on volume),
which is also in agreement with that from Tang et al [3].
Flow/velocity field
Figure 7(a) shows representative MPIV velocity vector plots
at three different positions by averaging velocity data obtained
over 20 consecutive images from the case shown in figure 1 for
inlet, middle and outlet regions, respectively at Ex = 5 kV m−1.
Non plug-like(concave) velocity profile is observed at inlet and
outlet regions in 25 mM borate buffer. More uniform velocity
over the channel cross section was found in figure 7(a) in the
middle region. Inlet/outlet region effects are noted. Similarly,
as shown in figure 7(b), the slightly parabolic (convex)
velocity profile shows the Joule heating effect in the middle
region due to an induced negative pressure gradient along the
downstream direction at Ex = 25 kV m−1. The ensemble
average (based on 20 consecutive images measured normal to

the flow direction at a particular downstream location) velocity
in each region is also indicated in each individual plot of
figure 7. More detailed explanations can be found later in
figure 8
Cross-stream velocity profiles of EOFs in 25 mM borate
buffer at the middle region of Dh = 200 µm microchannel
at Ex = 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 kV m−1 with/without Joule
heating are given in figures 8(a)–(c), respectively. The
plug-like motion, a characteristic of EOF, is apparent, and
the velocity profiles remain fairly flat right to the wall for
Ex  15 kV m−1 as shown in figures 8(a)–(c), while for
Ex = 20 and 25 kV m−1, convex-shape velocity (figure 8(b))
happens at the channel middle portions possibly due to Joule
heating. This is because the Joule heating effect causes both
temperature rise and temperature gradient inside the entire
microchannel. The electric conductivity of the buffer solution
is linearly increased with the temperature rise, resulting in
locally higher electric field strength in the inlet and outlet
regions of the microchannel, which indicates the electric field
strength is lower in the middle region. While the combined
effect of permittivity, viscosity, and zeta potential due to

is differently shaped in different regions of the channel like
the present inlet/outlet (figure 8(a) and (c)) and middle region
where different velocity shapes (concave versus convex) occur.
This has also been verified earlier from µLIF temperature
measurements for four different buffer solutions. In fact, these
results are also consistent with the corresponding velocity
vectors as shown earlier in figure 7.
Plots of average electroosmotic velocities versus applied
electric field strength for 1× TBE on a constant electrophoretic
mobility with different channel widths of 100, 150 and 200 µm
with/or without Joule heating are shown in figure 9. A linear
increase in velocity with increasing field (15 kV m−1) was
observed for these three channel widths. The error bars on
the MPIV results shown in figure 9 represent conservative
95% confidence levels. These error estimates include both the
uncertainty in determining the particle displacement in each
set of images and other experimental uncertainties associated
with converting this displacement into actual velocities, such
as the estimated physical dimension of one pixel in each image
and the CCD camera framing rate.
Although the channel width effect seems not clearly noted,
the differences in magnitude on EOF velocity among three
different (H/W) are still obtained, especially for the cases
without Joule heating as shown in figure 9. It is found
that the larger W is, the lower the average velocity. The
results obtained from Hsieh et al [5] were also included for
Figure 9. Average electroosmotic velocity (middle region) versus

comparison. Obviously, the present results shown are a little
bit lower than those from Hsieh et al [5] except for a 200 µm
microchannel at Ex = 25 kV m−1, which is expected due to
the different channel material used in the present study. At

Conclusions
The temperature distribution as well as 2D velocity vector
fields through µLIF and MPIV measurements of EOF in
three rectangular microchannels of Dh = 88.9 µm, 104.3 µm
and 114.3 µm with four types of buffers has been
investigated experimentally. Important features can be drawn
as follows.
(1) The Joule heating effect has been extensively studied and
the related data were obtained.
(2) The corrected EOF velocity profile as well as EOF
mobility was found via corrections made for viscosity
and permittivity of the buffer, and zeta potential by the
temperature modified method [10].
(3) Joule heating and its effects with channel width change
are examined and found to be quite significant.
(4) Zeta potential seems to be a strong function of the pH
value of the buffer solution and is weakly influenced
by the channel aspect ratio (H/W) via buffer solution
temperature rise.

micro-channel relies mainly on diffusion. Since diffusion
is a slow process, many investigators have studied ways to
improve mixing with microfluidic devices, either actively
or passively. Due to the difficulties inherent in fabricating
and implementing active micro-mixers, a high performance
passive mixing strategy is therefore more desirable [3].
In general, turbulent flows and mechanical agitation
make rapid mixing possible by segregating the fluid in small
filament, which increase the contact surface and decrease the
mixing path. However, on the micro-scale, because of the
low Reynolds numbers which are in turn due to small channel
dimensions, most flow streams are laminar in nature and do not
allow for efficient mixing. On the other hand, diffusion is an
important factor in mixing because of short diffusion lengths.
Active micro-mixers use external disturbance to enhance the
mixing process, while, passive micro-mixers usually enhance
the diffusion process by using channel geometry to stir or
laminate fluids without external disturbance. The simplest
category of micro-mixers is T-mixers/or Y-mixers.
Mixing in micro-channels can be enhanced through
chaotic advection, a process during which simple regular
fields produce chaotic particle trajectories. Chaotic advection
can increase the contact surface between different fluids and
decrease the mixing path between them, and thus enhance
the mixing. The occurrence of chaotic advection typically
indicates rapid distortion and elongation of material interfaces.
This process significantly increases the area across which
diffusion occurs and results in rapid mixing. Chaotic advection
can be induced by constructing special geometries in the
mixing channel, for example, by using serpentine geometries
[4] to increase the contact surface area between different fluids
and to decrease the diffusion path between them. Thus, the
key to generating advection is the modification of the channel
shape to produce stretching and folding; stretching and folding
may be roughly equated to chaos as reported by Ottino and
Wiggins [5].
Based on the discussion above, it is clear that the success
of a logistically simple method to improve micro-mixing lies
in our ability to mix material in the cross section, i.e., to
create a large amount of contact interfacial area between two
initially segregated solutions in the least amount of time and
with the least amount of energy. Chaotic micro-mixers, one
of the principal passive micro-mixers, can stretch and fold the
streams by rotating the streamline inside the micro-channel
[6] and are quite effective. It is recognized that [7, 8] in order
to mix well at low Reynolds numbers, as in creeping flow, the
geometry of channel must be complicated enough that chaotic
advection is generated. This is because in the creeping flow
regime, viscous forces in the fluid dominate inertia forces and
the fluid velocities in a channel cross section are essentially
two-dimensional. Mixing enhancement in this regime can be
achieved by adding complexity to the system. However, in
order for the channel to be easily fabricated and integrated
into existing microfluidic systems, the geometry should be left
relatively simple. It is the optimization of these competing
factors that drives present micro-mixer designs. In addition,
using electroosmotic flow (EOF), it is easier to induce off-axis
and lateral transport within the micro-channel than pressure-
driven flow due to much lower flow rates in EOF.
In this paper, we will present a novel and easily fabricated
passive micro-mixer of five different geometries as shown
in figures 1(a)–(e) that is able to achieve a high degree of
lateral transport and mixing over a range of electroosmotic
flow rates (0.027  Re  0.081). Here, these five structured
geometries were labeled as Tr, Tw, Twr, Tcd and Tcdr, and
the superscript of each denotes roughened, wavy, wavy-
roughened, convergent-divergent and convergent-divergent
with roughened surfaces, respectively. Comparisons on
mixing performance will be made among these micro-mixers
with conventional T-shaped mixers.
Experimental details
Fabrication technique for the micro-channel
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of a T-shaped (with five
different geometries) PDMS micro-channel of a 200 µm depth
and 200 µm width. 3D geometry and its dimensions can
be clearly seen in figures 1(a), (c) and (e). The fabrication
process is based on a PDMS replica molding technique as
shown in figure 2. Two different sizes of ultra-thick negative
photoresist (MicroChem, Newton, MA, SU-8 2100 and 3050,
respectively) were used to produce the micro-channel pattern.
Detailed fabrication descriptions are explained below.
The photomasks needed are designed using CAD software
and printed by a 20 000 dpi image setter. The photoresist is
spin coated on a wafer slide to obtain 120 µm for the first
layer, as in figure 2(b), and 80 µm for the second layer as in
figure 2(d). These photoresist films are exposed in sequence
to a UV source with the photomask on top after preheating.
A post-baking process is employed and the photoresist film is
developed in a SU-8 developer (MicroChem, Newton, MA) to
obtain the positive masters. All the parameters, such as the
spin-coating speed, baking time, baking temperature and UV
exposure time followed the instruction from MicroChem with
only minor modifications.
During the process, the excess photoresist was peeled
off from the water that had a negative pattern of the master.
Meanwhile, a 10:1 mixture of PDMS pre-polymer was poured
onto the master (see figure 2 for details) and cured for 1 h at
70 ◦C. After curing, the PDMS replica mold was peeled from
the master. The PDMS channel was UV/ozone treated to alter
the surface properties and enhance the bonding as shown in
figure 2(h).
There are six different geometries of (including one
conventional) a T-shaped micro-channel used in this study.
The conventional T-shaped micro-channel has a cross section
(H × W) of 200 × 200 µm2 and a 10 mm length. The surface
roughness/rectangular roughness element is 100 µm wide
and 80 µm high placed centrally on the channel floor with
a pitch of 400 µm (see figures 1(a), (c) and (e)). A combined
alternating wavy channel surface and rectangular roughness
element geometry micro-channels were also implemented
as shown in figures 1(c) and (e). In addition, two
different wavy channel surfaces, namely, triangular and
trapezoidal or converging–diverging were used. Detailed
geometry and size are shown in figure 1. Basically, the present

Olympus STM6 measuring microscope with a 5×, numerical
aperture (NA) = 0.1 objective and a field of 1200 µm×900 µm
was implemented with a Sony SSC-DC 50A CCD camera
(768×576×24 bit) to capture the frames. A 12 V and 100 W
halogen (Xe/Hg) mercury light was provided as a light source
for an iodine imaging system.
For local velocity measurements, a µPIV technique was
employed. It was developed based on a cross-correlation
two-frame PIV method while a Gaussian peak-fit method was
employed to interpolate the sub-pixel displacement. The time
interval between each pair of two frames is 2 µs. The optical
setup is depicted in figure 5. The system is based on two
pulsed Nd:YAG lasers (New Wave Solo III, 50 mJ pulse−1,
double cavity) firing on the second harmonic (green 532 nm).
The laser pulse duration is 4–80 ms based on the velocity
magnitude.
The test system was mounted on a movable xz stage
on an epifluorescent microscope (DMILM Leica) with a
10× (working distance 8.65 mm), NA = 0.25 panchromatic
objective and a field of 800 µm × 600 µm with a measurement
depth of 27 µm. However, for velocities near the roughness
element, a 40× (working distance 1.78 mm), NA = 0.55
panchromatic objective and a field of 200 µm × 150 µm
with a depth of measure of 5 µm was used. The measurement
plane (i.e., object plane) was precisely positioned relative to
the test section by moving the objective lens vertically in the
y-direction and by moving the table horizontally in the x- and
z-directions. The concentration of fluorescent particles based
on interrogation volume was 5 × 1010 particles per millimeter.
The time frame interval of the CCD camera was 0.1 s
and the spatial resolution of the µPIV system was of
20 µm × 20 µm × 11 µm, and the interrogation cell (32 ×
32 pixels) overlay was 25%. Images were then classically
post-processing by eliminating erroneous vectors, and finally
860 velocity vectors were obtained in each instantaneous
velocity field. The time interval between two consecutive
velocity fields is about 15–25 ms. There was background
noise from out-of-focus particles near the wall but such noise

for relevant parameters and physical quantities of the present

The study combines µPIV and µLIF (micro-laser-induced
fluorescence) as shown in figure 5 to measure velocities and
the concentration alternately. A general overview of the setup
used to perform the µLIF experiments is also shown in figure 5.

10−5 M with constant flow rates (2.32 × 10−3 Qin 6.96 ×
10−3 µL s−1) was used to fill one of the reservoirs by means
of a liquid pipette. Fluorescence imaging of the rhodamine
B dye was performed using a Leica DMILM fluorescence
microscope equipped with a 10× objective, a mercury marc
lamp, a rhodamine filter set and a Dantec 80C77 HiSense
PIV/LIF CCD camera (1344 × 1024 × 12 bit) from which
the transformation of concentration fields in different areas
was recorded. Digital images were acquired and transferred
into a PC and successively processed and analyzed.
Quantifying mixing
Mixing efficiency [3] was used to evaluate the performance of
the micro-mixers:
meff =
(
1 −
∫ w
0 |C − C∞| dx∫ w
0 |C0 − C∞| dx
)
× 100%, (1)
where meff is the mixing efficiency, C is the mass concentration
distribution across the transverse direction at the outlet, C∞
is the concentration of a complete mixing, C0 is the initial
distribution of the concentration before any mixing and W is
the width of the channel.
Experimental setup
To visualize the mixing under electroosmotic flow, the micro-
channels were initially filled with a relevant buffer solution
(e.g. phosphate, NaCl solution, 1× TBE and borate buffer).
Then an equal amount of buffer was placed in one inlet channel
reservoir and in the outlet channel reservoir, while the second
inlet reservoir was filled with the iodine and the rhodamine-
labeled buffer. Platinum electrodes were then placed in contact
with the solution in the reservoirs such that the two inlet
reservoirs were fixed to ground, and the potential was applied
to the outlet channel reservoir as shown in figures 4 and 5.
Iodine dye and fluorescent images were obtained at different
electric field strengths of 2, 5, 10 and 15 kV m−1.
Results and discussion
Iodine dye qualitative visualization
For six T-shaped micro-channels (one conventional T-shaped
channel was also examined to provide a reference basis)
the top view of the mixing processes along the downstream
of each micro-channel are illustrated in figures 6(a)–(f ) at
Re = 0.054. By the brightness of the color, it is clearly
shown that figures 6(d) and (f) exhibit more effective mixing
with a smaller mixing length because a periodic deformation
of the interface between two fluids and redistribution and
intersection of the flow streams occurs. For both figures,
the flow stirring seems strong as compared to the rest figures.
This is partly because the periodic positioned ribs can improve
mixing performance by affecting the flow pattern and, in part
because the periodic wavy and converging–diverging micro-
channel can periodically alter the flow direction. Additionally,
the structured micro-channel can force one fluid to flow into
another to create lateral mass transport. Congruently, the
distortion of the material interface demonstrates that, even at
the low Re, the twisting and turning of the flow through these
five channel configurations produce significant stretching in
the fluid. This claim can be further verified in the forthcoming
section.

concentration distribution for six configurations at two

time in the channel is longer at lower Re, thus allowing more
time for mixing by pure diffusion (i.e., low Pe). In fact, this
behavior is consistent for all the five channel configurations as
shown in figure 7.
Based on these observations, the streamline can thus
be sketched as shown in figure 8(a). Obviously, the
alternating wavy surface micro-channels with ribs do not
form a homogeneous motif along the channel. The pattern
changes periodically. A helically shaped movement of fluid
was observed. This translates kinematically to a displacement
of the centers of the fluid helices. This periodic variation
of the helical structure along the micro-channel can be
considered as a time-dependent modification of the flow which
is beneficial to chaos. In fact, chaos is shown to be created in
figure 8(a) by a periodical succession of folding and stretching
of the streamline in the system. It may not be sufficient,
but with non-slip boundary conditions of viscous flow, the
fluid streams would be stretched and folded along the channel
continuously, the stretching and folding reduced the diffusion
path dramatically and sufficiently for a rapid mixing. In fact,
the flow is also splitting and recombining periodically while
approaching to the ribs due to the present rib geometry (not
fully occupied the width of the channel in the z-direction).
Continuous stretching and folding, splitting and recombination
are all key processes to induce chaotic advection.
Figure 7. Concentration distribution at x = 2100–2700 µm by
µLIF.
Moreover, flow around this type of micro-channel will be
three dimensional [9], with secondary flows being generated
in the channel cross section where, in combination with the
streamwise axial flow, fold and stretch flow stream interface
[10] and can produce chaotic advection [11]. As a result, the
interfacial area across which diffusion is dominant is greatly
increased which again leads to rapid mixing. In addition,
this distortion of the streamline shown in figure 8(a) again
demonstrates that, even at a lower Re of 0.054, the twisting
and turning of the flow through the wavy rib-roughed micro-
channel generates secondary flows that produce significant
stretching in the fluid as shown in figure 8(a). To our
knowledge and experience, it is speculated that the cross-flow
patterns (not shown) near the ribs would exhibit the shift of
the stagnation point surrounded by closed streamlines before
(after) the flow approaches (passing) the rib. Such flow pattern
shift and the stagnation point alternation form a blinking flow,
which possesses the characteristic of chaotic advection.
Also included in figure 8(a) are the corresponding detailed
mass concentration distributions due to mixing at the channel
inlet (x = 300 µm), middle portion (x = 2300 µm) and
the exit (x = 4500 µm), respectively, of the channel along
with the calculated mixing efficiency. The color evolution
expresses the variations of the mass concentration for each
fluid stream. The values of the mixing efficiencies at the
above three locations clearly indicate the mixing performance
of the channel. Figure 8(b) plots spanwise variations of the
mass concentration in the z-direction at the corresponding
locations with their mixing efficiency. Since resolution in the
y-direction is not possible for the LIF measurements (unlike
the µPIV), the concentration values presented here represent
the concentration averaged over the channel depth. Good and
excellent mixing was found at the middle and the exit of the

is finally calculated for the whole channel for all six micro-
channels as shown in figure 10. Similarly, except for the
T-shaped micro-channel, all channels studied have completely
mixed within the channel length. This information can provide
us with the ability to define a mixing length for these five
channels. The effect of the structured channel on the variation
of the mixing efficiency is clearly noted from x = 0 to x =
4500 µm as compared to that of straight channel from x =
4500 to x = 10100 µm. Furthermore, one can find that the
complete mixing was almost achieved before the flow reaching
the straight channel for all the structured channels except the
Tr channel. This also agrees with the results presented in
[1] for a less-efficient form of the micro-channel mixer with
slanted ridges.
Mixing length correlation
The Pe is a good indicator of whether diffusive mixing alone
is sufficient with a specified channel width and with a certain
linear flow velocity. The higher the Pe the harder it is
to achieve mixing by diffusion, especially within a definite
channel length. In fact, the necessary channel length increases
linearly with the logarithmic Pe as the flow is fully chaotic
at a fixed Reynolds number by varying the Schmidt number

tive heat transfer. Consequently, much work has gone into the
development of microchannel technology recently. Up to now,
with regard to ﬂows through microchannels, the knowledge is
more advanced for gaseous than for liquid ﬂows [5]. However, in
some cases like advanced heat sink designs as applied to micropro-
cesser cooling with average chip heat ﬂuxes in the range of
40–60W/cm2, air cooling may not be appropriate. On the contrary,
single phase liquid ﬂow through the microchannels would be ex-

judgment and conclusion are still in question. A review article
written by Morini [14] has reported that either Nusselt number in-
creases/or decreases with Reynolds number increase was found in
the laminar regime. In addition, the Reynolds analogy fails in
microchannels. Based on these results, it is concluded that there

2. PDMS microchannel fabrication
The PDMS microchannels were fabricated in house at the Uni-
versity Microsystem laboratory by casting twenty straight open
channels (i.e., channel array) from PDMS methyl acrylate (Dow
Corning Co.) and sealed with the same material with speciﬁc grav-
ity of 1.08, viscosity of 3900 mPas, and thermal conductivity
0.18 W/mK at the temperature of 25 C, respectively. The casting
mold was made by SU-8 deep UV lithography. Detailed SU-8 mold
design and PDMS channel fabrication through deep UV lithography
can be explained as follows. The fabrication starts with silicon wa-
fers insulated by thermal oxidation. The SU-8 photoresist is spin-
coated at 2000 rpm onto silicon wafers to create masters for 30 s
with 100 lm in thickness. A mask is made out of high-solution
quartz glass printed to scale to put on the silicon wafers, and then
a UV beam (365 nm) is illuminated for a few minutes to make a
negative etched channel manifold. During the process, the excess
photoresist is peeled off from the silicon substrate that has a neg-
ative pattern of the master. Meanwhile, a 10 (PDMS):1 (curing
agent) mixture of PDMS prepolymer was poured onto the master
and cured for 1 h at 70 C. After curing the PDMS replica mold
was peeled from the master. Flat pieces of PDMS were formed by
casting prepolymer against a silicon wafer and curing. To form en-
system allows simultaneous power control, wall temperature mea-
surement, as well as optical imaging of the ﬂow visualization.

Transfer (2008), doi:10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2008.05.021The microchannel ﬂow loop is mounted to a ﬁxture with rele-
vant ﬂow components. The main part was a strip of 200 lm wide
and 200 lm thick strip type microheater made of aluminum with
a heated section of 10 mm  20 mm (nominal) exposed to the test
ﬂuid. The heat input has implemented on either side (top for iso-
ﬂux and bottom for isothermal) of the active section which was
connected (via AWG 20 lead wire), in turn, to power leads. The test
section was thermally insulated by ﬁberglass to minimize heat
losses.
Temperature measurements were performed via ﬁfty-two T
type thermocouple wires located on respective positions as also
shown in Fig. 1. These ﬁfty-two thermocouples had been divided
into two groups. One group (only two thermocouples are needed)
is for channel upstream plenum and downstream plenum temper-
ature reading; the other group of the remainder ﬁfty thermocou-
ples was broken into ﬁve sets for the wall temperature
measurements at ﬁve respective downstream locations. Namely,
each set/or location has ten thermocouples which gives the tem-
perature reading for the chosen channels (10 channels were cho-
sen) at a given location. Noting that both micro strip-heaters and
thermocouples were ﬂush mounted to, and insulated from, the
channel walls. There is only one-side heating either isothermal/or
isoﬂux on the channel bottom or top ﬂoor. This thermal boundary
condition gives an asymmetrically heating; however, the surface
temperature of top and bottom ﬂoor were measured to examineclosed channels, a PDMS replica and a 0.18 mm thickness cover
glass (Superior Marienfeld, refraction index n = 1.518) were used
and bonded by hot pressing to enclose the microchannel. Then, it
was rinsed in acetone as well as in ethanol and dried with argon
stream. The present surface property can be switched from hydro-
phobicity to hydrophilicity by using one of energetic surface treat-
ments like UV radiation (UV/ozone) and plasma exposure for 30
minutes.
For these twenty channels, precise information of the channel’s
dimension is extremely important for an accurate evaluation on
convective heat transfer in microchannels. The depth, width, and
length were measured optically with an uncertainty of less than
±0.2%. To understand the present device surface condition, the
roughness of the channel was measured along its center with the
surface proﬁlometer. The uncertainties for relevant geometric
parameters are also listed in Table 2. The resultant channels were
examined by an electron microscope. These twenty microchannels
have the same respective dimensions and characteristics.
In order to observe hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface effect
on ﬂuid and heat transfer mechanism, both surface condition were
tested and associated data were measured. Further, to investigate
both ﬂow and heat transfer characteristics of a liquid ﬂowing
through microchannels, heating condition for the present micro-
channel/test section was shown in Fig. 1, for constant heat ﬂux
and constant wall temperature, respectively.

3.3. Temperature visualization experiments
The visualization of the local ﬂuid temperature was achieved
with the same apparatus as used for ﬂow visualization and mea-
surements; namely, Fig. 2. Instead of using a ﬂuorescent particle,
however, the channel was ﬁlled with a solution of rhodamine B,
which is a ﬂuorescent dye showing a temperature-sensitive quan-
tum yield in the range of 0–100 C. Calibration was done by means
of a simple conduction problem in the pure water that can be
solved analytically. With this, the temperature scale can be read
through the related equation listed in Table 2. Uncertainty due to
lLIF measurement was found to be less than ±0.09 C. Experiments

long-working distance 10 objective. The images were recorded
using the same equipments with those used for lPIV measure-
ments. From the captured images, the detailed temperature distri-
bution can be extracted. The intensity values of the captured
images then were converted to temperature using the intensity
vs temperature calibration.
4. Data reduction and uncertainty
The experiments were carried out under steady state condi-
tions. For each different set of experimental runs, the data includ-
ing ﬂow rates, liquid temperatures, inlet and outlet pressures, the
test section top/bottom wall temperatures, and the input voltage
and current were continuously measured and recorded using a dig-
ital acquisition system based on an IBM PC. The parameters used in
the data reduction and analysis are summarized below:
