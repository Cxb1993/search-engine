differential-input and (n-1)/2 single-ended-input 
OTAs and n grounded capacitors whereas the 
second structure consists of 2n complementary 
single-ended-input OTAs, (n-1)/2 
single-ended-input OTAs, and n grounded 
capacitors. Their corresponding third-order elliptic 
filter structures use three differential-input and one 
single-ended-input OTAs and six complementary 
single- ended-input and one single-ended-input 
OTAs in addition to three grounded capacitors. It is 
well-known that the parasitic admittance of a 
differential-input OTA is much larger in magnitude 
than that of a single-ended-input OTA. Moreover, it 
has been validated that a complementary 
single-ended-input OTA-based circuit is better in 
output precision than a single-ended-input 
OTA-based one [23]. Hence, it is very interesting 
to know as to which one of the following three 
third-order OTA-C elliptic filter structures: (i) a 
voltage-mode one using differential-input OTAs, (ii) 
a voltage-mode one using complementary 
single-ended- input OTAs, and (iii) the recently 
reported current-mode one using 
single-ended-input OTAs, has the smallest 
parasitics.  
II. ANALYTICAL SYNTHESIS OF 
VOLTAGE-MODE ODD-NTH-ORDER 
OTA-GROUNDED C ELLIPTIC FILTER 
STRUCTUR 
In this section, the differential-input OTAs will be 
considered to be used in circuit design for first 
reducing the component numbers of a circuit structure 
and then transforming into a complimentary 
single-ended-input OTA form [?] which was verified 
to be better in output precision than a popular 
single-ended-input OTA form. The transfer function of 
a voltage-mode odd-nth-order elliptic filter structure is 
shown as below.

For even-nth-order cases, two new analytical 
synthesis methods are applied to synthesize two 
voltage-mode elliptic filter structures. One uses 
3n/2 single-ended-input OTAs, n-1 grounded 
capacitors, and one floating capacitor. The other 
employs (3n/2)+2 single-ended-input OTAs and n 
grounded capacitors. And the recently reported 
current- mode even-nth-order elliptic filter 
structure is with 3n/2 single-ended-input OTAs and 
n grounded capacitors. It is also very interesting as 
to which one has the most precise output 
parameters in the above stated three even-nth-order 
elliptic filter structures. 
Dividing both sides of (2) by sn-1, we obtain

I addition to these above two questions, sensitivity 
is also an important parameter in output 
performance. In the following six filter structures, 
namely, (1) a voltage-mode differential-input 
OTA-based third-order one, (2) a voltage-mode 
complementary single-ended-input OTA- based 
third-order one, (3) a current-mode single-ended- 
input OTA-based third-order one, (4) and (5) two 
voltage- mode single-ended-input OTA-based 
fourth-order ones with all grounded capacitors and 
with three grounded and a floating capacitors, 
respectively, and (6) a current-mode 
single-ended-input OTA-based fourth-order one 
[20], H-Spice simulations may tell us the following 
interesting question: which one has the lowest 
component sensitivity? Nevertheless, is a 
component sensitivity independent of the 
percentage of component variations? Are the group 
sensitivities still approximately equal to zero [20]? 
Is the sensitivity of fp the most important one in the 
sensitivities of all different parameters?      
An appropriate combination is shown below for the 
last five terms of (4).

Observing the above n+1 simple equations from 
(27.1) to (27.n+1), the circuit structure realized 
from (27.n-1) includes the structures synthesized 
from other simple equations using 
single-ended-input OTAs and grounded 
capacitors. After comparing (27.n-1) with 
(19.n-1), they are similar to each other. 
Therefore, combining all the sub-circuitries 
realized from each of the above equations from 
(27.1) to (27.n+1), another voltage-mode 
even-nth-order OTA-C elliptic filter structure 
different from the one shown in Fig. 12 is 
presented in Fig. 14. The differences between 
two filter structures shown in Figs. 12 and 14 are 
(i) the former uses 3n/2 single-ended-input 
OTAs, and the latter employs two more 
single-ended-input OTAs, and (ii) the former 
uses n-1 grounded capacitors, and one floating 
capacitor, but the latter employs n grounded 
capacitors. Since more OTAs have more 
parasitics in total, and a floating capacitor has 
more parasitics than a grounded capacitor, it is 
apparent that the comparison of the output 
performance between these two filter structures 
Therefore, (23) can be decomposed as

Note that although a differential-input OTA is 
replaced by two parallel and complementary 
single-ended-input OTAs, the elements in a 
group still remain the same as those of the 
differential-input OTA-based circuit structure 
when we consider the two parallel and 
complementary single-ended- input OTAs to be 
in the same group as their original 
differential-input OTA-based circuit structure.

floating capacitor into an all grounded capacitor

Moreover, is a current-mode circuit really better than 
a voltage-mode one? It is also a very interesting 
question. Let us tro to answer these questions.

which is also used in the recently reported work [20]. 
To validate the theoretical predictions, H-spice 
simulations with 0.35-μm process are now used. We 
use the CMOS implementation of a transconductor 
reported in [17], as shown in Fig. 10 of [20], with ±
1.65-V supply voltages and W/L=5μ/1μ and 10μ/1μ 
for nMOS and pMOS transistors, respectively. The 
component values for the third-order one are given by 
C1=24 pF, C2=8 pF (for the center capacitor in Figs. 6 
and 7), C3=24pF, and g1=78.79 μS, g2=163.51 μS, 
g3=53.12 μS, g4=128.07 μS, the latter four of which 
correspond to the OTAs one by one from left to right 
sides in Fig. 6. The amplitude- frequency responses 
are shown in Fig. 16. Table I shows the comparison 
for the output parameters, fp, fs, A1, A2, and Pk (means 
Peak) between theoretical and simulated results.

As can be seen, from Fig. 16 and Table I, the 
differential-input OTA-based filter structure (Fig. 6) 
has serious output distortion and deviation unlike the 
other two cases. However, when a differential-input 
OTA is replaced by two complementary 
single-ended-input OTAs in parallel, the new 
transformed filter structure (Fig. 7) becomes the one 
with completely opposite result, having very precise 
output parameters even a little bit better than the 
well-known single-ended-input OTA-based one like 
that shown in [20]. The main reason of this situation is 
that when a differential-input OTA is replaced by two 
parallel and complementary single-ended-input OTAs, 
one of which has for its input signal at the + terminal 
and the other one of which has its input signal 
entering from the – terminal, leading to a perfect 
cancellation of their corruptions to output signals.

transfer functions are given by

For the fourth-order filter shown in Fig. 13, we 
use W/L=10μ/0.5μ to pMOS and 5μ/0.5μ to nMOS 
transistors for the high-pass filter simulation, and 
replace the above length by 0.35μm from 0.5μm for 
the low-pass, band-pass, and band-reject ones. 
Component values are given by (i) C1=C2=C3=C4=30 
pF, and g1=342.77 μS, g2=344.91 μS, g3=111.33 μS, 
g4=197.53 μS, g5=82.06 μS, g6=17.01 μS for the 
high-pass one, and (ii) C1=C2=10 pF, C3=C4=20 pF, 
and g1=68.36 μS, g2=119.66 μS, g3=68.20 μS, 
g4=110.37 μS, g5=147.34 μS, g6=264.49 μS for the 
low-pass one. The above four capacitors and six 
capacitors are counted from left to right sides and 
from up to bottom lines in Fig. 13. The high-pass and 
low-pass amplitude-frequency responses are shown in 
Figs. 17 and 18, respectively. Table II shows the 
comparison for the output parameters, fp, fs, A1, A2, 
and Pk between theoretical and simulated results. 
As can be seen from Figs. 17, 18 and Table II, we 
may conclude that (i) both current-mode [20] and 
voltage-mode (Fig. 13) fourth-order elliptic high-pass 
and low-pass filters has very good accuracy in output 
responses; (ii) the only one floating capacitor used in 
Fig. 13 has not visible influence for output precision; 
and (iii) since the current-mode output signal shown 
in [20] is attained from a summation of several output 
current signals at the stage just before the output stage, 
the total output deviation may also be the summation 
of several deviations produced from several output 
current signals at the pre-output stage, leading to the 
voltage-mode one, shown in Fig. 13, having a little bit 
better in output accuracy than the recently reported 
current-mode one [20].

技術說明
(中文) 經由三個新的分析合成電路設計法及一種轉換法，四種不同形態(包含差分輸入
OTA、包含互補式單端接地OTA、包含單端接地OTA及全部接地電容、及包含單端
接地OTA及N-1個接地電容及一個浮接電容)的電壓式奇數或偶數N階橢圓濾波電路
結構。這個新的以互補式單端接地OTA設計的電壓式電路除了較以差分輸入OTA設
計的電路有非常懸殊的輸出精準度外，較最近發表的電流式以單端接地OTA設計
的電路還要準確。這是因為這個電流式的電路在輸出級使用了一個加法的動作，
使得輸出誤差也加起來變大了。但偶數階的電壓式低通及高通濾波電路則最近發
表的電流式有相同精準的輸出信號。H-SPICE的模擬結果還告訴我們:以互補式單
端接地OTA設計的橢圓濾波電路的元件敏感度遠較以差分輸入OTA設計的橢圓濾波
電路為低，甚至比用單端接地OTA設計的橢圓濾波電路還低。另外，一個小群的
元件敏感度總和為零的理論再一次被證實。
(英文) Through three new analytical synthesis methods and one transformation, four distinct 
kinds, i.e., (i) differential-input OTA-based, (ii) complementary single-ended-input OTA-
based, (iii) single-ended-input OTA and grounded capacitor, and (iv) single-ended-input 
OTA and all grounded but one floating capacitor, voltage-mode odd/even-nth-order 
elliptic filter structures are presented. The new complementary single-ended- input OTA-
based voltage-mode elliptic filter is much better in output accuracy than the differential-
input OTA-based one, and even a little bit better than the recently reported current-mode 
single-ended-input OTA-based one using all single-ended-input OTAs. The component 
sensitivities of the complementary single-ended- input OTA-based elliptic filter are much 
lower than those of the differential-input OTA-based elliptic filter, even lower than the 
single-ended-input OTA-based filters. Null group sensitivities are also investigated and 
verified.
