Abstract – This project is concerned with the design of 
a patient-safe interface for biopotential recording front-
end integrated on an application specific integrated circuit 
(ASIC). We have conceived and designed a system-on-
chip (SoC) which enables continuous monitoring of the 
front-end transistors for electrical degradation which may 
result in circuit failure and ultimate danger to the patient. 
The system was fabricated in TSMC 0.35um CMOS 
technology and evaluated on the test bench. This one-year 
project resulted in 1 SCI journal submission, 3 conference 
publications, 1 patent application and 1 Masters Degree 
thesis. 
I. Introduction 
With recent advances in technology the full integration of 
signal acquisition systems for physiological signals on a 
single chip has become feasible. Typical applications 
include the recording of the electrical signal associated 
with heart, peripheral nerve or muscle activity (ECG, 
ENG, or EMG respectively). High-gain amplifiers are 
conventionally connected to the electrodes by AC-
coupling to reject electrode offset voltages. However, as 
physiological signals occupy a low-frequency band the 
cut-off frequency of the input filter must also be very low. 
For example, the recording of ECG requires a cut-off 
frequency of less than 0.5 Hz [1]. In principle, DC-
coupled systems can be used to overcome this design 
challenge even in the presence of offset and interference 
[2], [3]. However, wide-spread use of DC coupling is 
currently limited by safety concerns as the flow of current 
in the input leads must be kept to a safe level even in the 
event of circuit failure. Lacking a series input capacitor, 
failure currents can potentially flow directly into the 
patient. This project proposed and implemented a 
prototype failure detection system integrated on an ASIC. 
II. Analytical and Simulation Approach 
A. Specification of a Tolerable Failure Current 
The limit of the tolerable failure current depends on a 
number of factors, including the signal frequency and the 
electrode contact area [4]. Limits on catheter current 
suggest a maximum of around 10 µA to prevent a 
microshock and resulting fibrillation of the heart [1], [4]. 
For implanted devices which interface directly with the 
peripheral nervous system or with muscle fibers the 
charge flux must be limited to prevent electrode and 
tissue damage as well as inadvertent stimulation. 
Prolonged direct current flow is not permissible even at 
relatively low current levels due to the ensuing electro-
chemical effects at the electrode-tissue interface which 
can lead to electrode and tissue damage. Charge-balanced 
current waveforms (i.e. AC signals), however, may safely 
reach higher peak amplitudes. For implanted stimulating 
device of the muscle a charge density of 0.4 µC per mm2 
of electrode area delivered in 50 Hz intervals was 
established as a safe limit [5]. In the study of stimulators 
of nerve [6] it is found that charge-balanced signals do not 
cause significant tissue damage at levels up to 2 µC/mm2 
per pulse. Thus, assuming a typical electrode area of 2.5 
mm2 [7], the maximum permissible electrode charge is 1 
µC. Presuming a sinusoidal waveform the equivalent peak 
current amplitude Ip is calculated:

 where Q is the charge and f the signal frequency. Using 
(1) it is clear that the failure current is practically limited 
by the 10 µA level to prevent fibrillation rather than by a 
stimulation limit, which remains above 10 µA for 
frequencies exceeding 3.2 Hz. Significantly higher 
currents are used for intentional stimulation [6], [8].

physiological signal using on-chip blocking capacitors to maintain 
patient safety. 
• For small Ze the amplifier voltage is centered near the 
targeted differential amplitude of 4 mV. Larger electrode 
impedance lowers the detected voltage in agreement with 
(5). Therefore, it is possible in principle that also broken 
electrodes can be detected using this circuit. The standard 
deviation of the voltage input amplitude is 28 µV, 29 µV 
and 86 µV respectively for 1 kΩ, 10 kΩ and 100 kΩ 
electrode impedance. 
In a second set of simulations the effect of common-mode 
(CM) variation in the test signal source is examined by 
letting Vt1=-Vt2=VCM=5 mV. The histograms are also 
shown in Fig. 3. The electrode current scales inversely to 
the electrode impedance and reaches to around 10 nA for 
small Ze and the chosen CM amplitude in agreement with 
(2). The opposite is true for the differential amplifier input 
voltage Vin caused by a common mode test signal 
component. Vin increases as the Ze increases. 
C.2 System simulation - The circuit of Fig. 1 and the 
detection circuit of Fig. 2 are simulated using the Spectre 
simulator of the Cadence design environment. The fully 
differential amplifier provides a cut-off frequency at 158 
kHz, a DC gain of 200 and infinite input impedance. Each 
amplifier output is followed with a passive filter network. 
The filter separates the low-frequency physiological 
signal Vphysio for further processing and the test signal Vtest 
for continuous monitoring. The test signal is successfully 
extracted yielding a differential amplitude of around 20 
mV as expected. The output of the physiological signal 
filter showed that the test signal is removed, leaving the 
amplified physiological signal available for further 
processing. Peak lead current ie is simulated as 332 pA in 
agreement with (2). The schematic is further used to 
simulate the performance of the system for a suddenly 
occurring defect. An OTA-C oscillator with differential 
ouput [10] is implemented and used to generate the test 
signal input. A differential gain stage with n-mos input 
devices models the gain stage. A gate-oxide-short (GOS) 
is incorporated by splitting the input devices into two 
series transistors so that the common gate can be 
connected to the centre point (channel) through a 100 Ω 
resistor in series with a switch [5]. The detection circuit is 
also included in the simulation. In normal operation the 
GOS-switch is open and the test signal is received at the 
filter output. After 10µs the switch is closed to simulate a 
GOS, causing 5µA failure current to flow from the 
amplifier into the affected input lead. As required, the test 
signal immediately disappears as shown in Fig. 4. After a 
brief delay of 0.7 µs the signal indicating absence of the 
test signal goes high. This signal increase the counter in 
the detection system. 
III. Measured Results 
The system is fabricated in 0.35 µm CMOS integrated 
circuit technology and the die photo is shown in Fig. 5. 
The high-pass and low-pass filter circuits are realized on-
chip using conventional CMOS circuits. Also, a test 
signal generator is included on the test chip. The test 
signal amplitude is measured as 1 Vpp. Measurements are 
performed on a randomly selected chip. The measured 
gain of the amplifier is 170 V/V with a cut-off frequency

A failure monitoring strategy for increased safety in physiological signal 
recorders is proposed and implemented on ASIC which allows the elimination of 
safety blocking capacitors in the patient leads. Analysis led to the choice of 
optimum component values. Mismatch analysis showed that the proposed signal 
coupling scheme tolerates practical parameter variations. An integrated circuit 
implementation is used to evaluate the performance. Measured results confirm that 
a failure event is detectable using the proposed approach. Generally, a patient 
shock due to electrical failure of the input stage can thus be avoided. 
Although this is only a one-year project it resulted in several international 
publications. One SCI journal manuscript was written and submitted. It is currently 
under review. Three international conference papers were accepted and published 
[11], [12], [13]. One patent application was written and filed for Taiwan patent 
protection [14]. Furthermore, the project aided the education of several students. 
Specifically, one Masters Degree thesis was based on this subject. Finally, 
demonstrating a prototype in hardware allows for further practical evaluation.
