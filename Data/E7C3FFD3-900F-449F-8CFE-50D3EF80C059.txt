information stored on magnetic core 
memory (magnetic-core memory)-based, 
nuclear magnetic memory as a result of 
the high cost of large volume and high 
power, in order to replace nuclear 
magnetic memory, I and Dr. Kahng 
co-invented the first stop floating 
(floating-gate) non-volatile memory at 
Bell Labs in 1967.  
Today, flash memory (Flash memory) 
has a non-volatile memory structure of the 
main flow, its extensive use in personal 
computers, as well as two aspects of 
embedded memory. In recent years, with 
consumer electronics products pandemic 
and portable electronic products can 
quickly universal in all families, one of 
the most important factor is the use of 
convenient flash memory high-provincial 
electricity, high-density and lightweight 
characteristics of earthquake. Traditional 
non-volatile memory for the main 
structure of floating gate polysilicon 
(poly-Si float gate), as shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.Floating ate memory device 
 
Plus the gate bias, the carrier of silicon 
plate can be gained large enough kinetic 
energy to tunnel tunneling oxide by FN 
and storage in the poly-crystal floating 
gate (floating gate). Removing the power 
supply in addition, the carrier in the 
floating gate don’t have enough kinetic 
energy to tunnel to substrate and cause 
limited sub-set of the floating gate, and 
then have a flat-band voltage of the 
translation, so that threshold voltage 
changes. There are different bits of the 
power flow for the detection of 
quasi-circuit judge to the effect of 
memory.  
With non-volatile memory in the large 
capacity, high-speed and low energy loss 
of the request, the floating gate memory 
and between the silica substrate 
(Tunneling oxide layer) need to microfilm 
down. However, scaling down the 
tunneling oxide layer made floating gate 
non-volatile memory components to face 
the inevitable clinical challenge. That is, 
in a number of components after the 
operation, making leaks easily track 
circuit was produced in the tunneling 
oxide layer,  once formed by the leakage 
of electrical path connected floating gate 
and substrate, stored in the floating gate of 
the carrier will then be through this path 
and all is lost, lead to the loss of memory 
effect. In recent years, nanocrystals have 
been applied to non-volatile memory 
(Figure 2), to solve the traditional 
poly-crystal silicon floating gate memory 
(eg, flash memory) scaling down problem. 
Different from the continuous conduction 
of the floating gate, the charge storage 
center (nanocrystals) was separate. After 
several rounds of the components read 
data from and after the write process, the 
tunneling oxide layer caused by leakage 
circuit track, even with some linked 
nanocrystals, it will only result in the 
storage part of the loss of the carrier. It is 
still non-volatile memory the 
characteristics of

treatment. 
For the sample without the treatment in 
Fig. 3(a), the peak position of XPS Si 2p 
situated at 102.9 eV indicates that the 
surrounding oxide of nanocrystals is 
SiOx.[1] There is no obvious difference in 
the peak positions between the samples 
with and without the treatment. However, 
it was found that an additional XPS peak 
(397.8 eV) appears in the Mo 3p and N 1s 
spectra of the charge storage layer after 
the plasma treatment, which indicates that 
the incomplete bonds in SiOx bonded with 
nitrogen after the plasma treatment, as 
shown in Fig. 3(b).[2] 
 
FIG. 4. (Color online) C-V curves of the MOS 
structure with and without the plasma treatment. 
The inset of the is the simple band diagram of the 
structure in the flat-band state. 
 
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the C-V 
curves of MOS structure embedded with 
Mo nanocrystals for the sample with and 
without the plasma treatment, respectively.   
At the smaller sweeping voltage of 2 V, 
there is a negligible memory window in 
Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) corresponding to the 
quasineutral state (i.e., no charge is stored 
in the charge storage layer under this 
sweeping range). At the larger sweeping 
voltages, there are counterclockwise 
memory hystereses in Fig. 4. The 
counterclockwise hystereses are due to 
carrier transport through tunnel oxide 
between the charge storage layer and the 
Si substrate. We note that the memory 
windows of the sample with the plasma 
treatment are smaller than that without the 
treatment. For the smaller memory 
window after the treatment, we speculate 
the nitrogen passivation in the charge 
storage layer. It has been suggested that 
the traps in the oxide around nanocrystals 
can capture carriers and contribute to the 
memory window.[3-4] According XPS 
results, the nitrogen was incorporated into 
the oxide around the Mo nanocrystals 
after the treatment. The incorporated 
nitrogen can passivate the traps in the 
oxide, which reduces the charge storage 
centers and leads to the smaller memory 
window, as indicated in the insets of Fig. 
4. 
 
 
 
FIG. 5. (Color online) The retention behavior of 
the MOS structures with and without the plasma 
treatment. 
 
Figure 5 is the comparison of the 
retention behavior for the samples with 
and without the plasma treatment. The 
retention was measured by a stress voltage 
of 10 V on Al gate electrode for 5 s. The 
memory window was obtained by 
comparing the C-V curves after the
