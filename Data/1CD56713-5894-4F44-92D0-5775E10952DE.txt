11. Introduction
Fiber laser sources have found many applications in laser science, optical communication,
frequency metrology, and biomedical technology, etc [1]. Rare-earth-doped fibers, such as
erbium-doped fiber (EDF) and ytterbium-doped fiber (YDF), have been extensively used as the gain
medium of fiber lasers. In the past few years, the studies of fiber lasers have been focused on the
short pulse generation because they are capable of providing pulsewidth shorter than 100 fs [2].
Unfortunately, the pulse repetition rates achieved with these sources are typically between several
tens of MHz to hundreds of MHz. Mode-locked lasers with ultra-high repetition rates exceeding 1
GHz can be useful in many applications, including high-speed optical communication, clocking,
spectroscopy and precision metrology [3]. There are several methods to increase the repetition
rate of passively mode-locked lasers, such as shortening the cavity length or using an external
high-finesse etalon to increase the number of pulses in the cavity. Martinez et al. reports a
passively mode-locked fiber laser operating at 1.55-m anomalous dispersion regime based on
miniature all-fiber Fabry-Perot laser (~ 10 mm cavity length) with carbon nanotube, which has
generated pulse train of the highest repetition rates about 25 GHz, corresponding to 6th harmonic of
the fundamental frequency [4]. Repetition rates above 1 GHz can also be achieved by external
filtering the fundamentally mode-locked laser with Fabry-Perot cavity [5]. Unfortunately, this
method requires the use of expensive high-finesse etalons and complex stabilization systems.
Harmonic mode-locking (HML) is often adopted in fiber lasers to increase the pulse repetition rate.
Under very large intracavity powers, the HML repetition rate can be increased to GHz level [6, 7].
Sobon et al. report a passively mode-locked Er/Yb-doped double-clad fiber laser operating at
1.55-m anomalous dispersion regime, which is capable of generating pulse train with repetition
rates up to 10 GHz, corresponding to the 634th harmonic of the fundamental frequency [7].
However, the pump power of this fiber laser is as high as 7 W.
Recently, semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have been used as the gain media in fiber
lasers. As compared with the rare-earth-doped fibers, SOAs have many practical advantages such
as compact in size, higher optical nonlinearity, and larger gain bandwidth. In addition, the
excited-state lifetime of SOAs (scaling from nanoseconds to picoseconds) is much shorter than
those of doped fibers (millisecond order). As a result, the energy stored in the excited state and the
gains of SOAs are typically smaller than doped fibers, but the response of SOAs are much faster.
Yang et al. demonstrated the generation of 800-fs optical pulses using a 1.55-m SOA with a
passive mode-locking technique of nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE) [8]. However, the
pulse repetition rate is only 14 MHz. In previous works we have obtained multi-state operations in
an erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) and an all-normal-dispersion ytterbium-doped fiber laser
(YDFL) by introducing NPE or hybrid mode-locking mechanism in the laser cavity [9, 10]. In this
project we develope a high-repetition-rate passively mode-locked fiber laser using a 1.06-m SOA
as the gain medium, as well as a hybrid mode-locked semiconductor and ytterbium-doped fiber
laser. These lasers operate in the normal-dispersion regime and the pulse forming mechanism is
quite different from those of traditional soliton fiber lasers operating in the anomalous-dispersion
3(NALM). The output of SOA-based fiber laser is measured by a high-speed InGaAs photodetector,
a digital oscilloscope, a power meter, an optical spectrum analyzer, and a radio frequency (RF)
spectrum analyzer.
Figure 2 shows the setup of active/passive hybrid mode-locked semiconductor and
ytterbium-doped fiber laser. The ring-cavity laser is constructed by an ytterbium-doped fiber
amplifier (YDFA) with built-in optical isolators, a 10/90 output coupler with 10% output, a
polarizer, two polarization controllers, and a semiconductor optical amplifier. The polarizer is
optional inserted in the cavity to obtain different operations states. In this ring cavity fiber laser,
the YDFA works as the gain medium, while the SOA works as an active mode-locker for which the
injection current is modulated by a signal generator. Due to the polarization dependence of SOA
gain (or loss, depending on the SOA current), the combination of an SOA and polarization
controllers works effectively as the nonlinear gain (or loss). On the other hand, the combination of
polarizer and polarization controllers works effectively as the nonlinear loss. Finally, the output of
the active/passive hybrid mode-locked fiber laser is measured by a high-speed InGaAs
photodetector, a digital oscilloscope, a power meter, an optical spectrum analyze, and an RF
spectrum analyzer.

3. Results and Discussions
By properly adjusting the intracavity polarization controllers, stable mode-locked pulses are
obtained in the figure-eight SOA-based fiber laser of Fig. 1. We find that the laser tends to operate
at high-order harmonic mode-locking states. The pulse repetition rate will be changed by either
tuning the intracavity polarization controllers or the SOA injection current. At a fixed SOA
injection current of 100 mA, the HML pulse repetition rates can be adjusted discretely in a very
broad range from 336 MHz to 1.94 GHz via the polarization tuning. Table 1 shows the average
output power and the corresponding pulse repetition rate. The SOA-based fiber laser shows a
tendency of increasing the pulse repetition rate with the output power. This might be caused by
5and 660 mA, respectively. HML repetition rates of 1.94 GHz, 5.83 GHz, and 12.02 GHz have
been obtained with the high extinction ratio of 39 dB, 41 dB, and 45 dB against the noise. Owing
to the bandwidth limitation (26 GHz) of the RF spectrum analyzer, only the first and second
harmonics of the repetition frequency can be measured for the 12.02 GHz HML [as shown in Fig.
5(c)]. Since this SOA-based fiber laser still works in the linear regime of repetition-rate curve (Fig.
3), the HML order should be scalable to even higher values if the intracavity power is further
increased. However, the maximum operation current of this SOA is limited to 600 mA; therefore,
further increase of the intracavity power would be achieved by fusion-splicing all the fiber
components in the laser.

7In the hybrid mode-locked fiber laser of Fig. 2, we firstly insert the polarizer in the cavity,
and the YDFA pump current is set to 1.6 A. The DC bias current of 70 mA is firstly mixed with
the sinusoidal output from a signal generator, and then injected into the SOA device. At the
fundamental beating frequency of 3.40 MHz, we adjust the intracavity polarization controllers and
obtain the fundamentally mode-locking with output power of 0.90 mW. Figures 7(a) and 7(b)
show the pulse train and the optical spectrum, respectively. The spectral curve has several peaks
ranging from 1058.4 nm to 1085.8 nm, which might be caused by the parasitic Fabry-Perot filtering
effect resulting from the SOA endfaces.

When the polarizer is removed from the cavity, the YDFA pump current is reduced to 1.4 A to
maintain virtually the same intracavity power. Since the total cavity length is shortened, the
fundamental beating frequency is increased to 3.64 MHz. After carefully adjusting the intracavity
polarization controllers we have obtained the fundamentally mode-locked pulse train and optical
spectrum shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), with output power of 0.88 mW. The peak wavelength is
1079.6 nm, and the FWHM spectral width is 8.0 nm. It is interesting that the parasitic Fabry-Perot
filtering effect is eliminated for this cavity, and the laser spectrum is broadened as well.

Abstract: Harmonic mode-locking is operated in an 18-m figure-8 laser cavity having SOA 
gain medium at 1060 nm under normal dispersion. We can tune the repetition rate from 0.336 
to 1.75 GHz by adjusting intracavity polarization at 100 mA pump. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Fiber laser sources have found many applications in laser science, optical communication, frequency metrology, 
and biomedical technology, etc [1].  Rare-earth-doped fibers and semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have 
been used as the gain medium of fiber lasers, and studies have been focused on erbium-doped fiber lasers 
(EDFLs) and ytterbium-doped fiber lasers (YDFLs).  Pulsed operation of lasers is an extensively studied topic 
of laser physics, especially,  YDFLs have proved to be competitive and reliable light sources delivering short 
pulses down to 28 fs [2].  In order to generate ultrashort pulses in fiber lasers, passive mode-locking have been 
widely reported based on two major types of mechanisms: (a) nonlinear polarization evolution (NPE) and (b) 
saturable absorbers (SAs). 
Due to its large gain bandwidth, compactness and high nonlinearity, semiconductor optical amplifiers are 
often used to build continuous-wave (CW) wavelength-tunable lasers or multiwavelength lasers.  In generating 
ultrashort pulses, most of the researches have utilized active mode-locking technologies [3].  Although the pulse 
repetition rate can be raised up to GHz order or higher, the laser system is complicated and expensive.  Yang et 
al. [4] demonstrated the generation of 800-fs optical pulses using a 1.55-µm SOA and a passive NPE ring-laser 
configuration.  However, the repetition rate of mode-locked pulses is only 14 MHz.  Recently, 1.06-µm SOA 
has become commercially available.  Because of the wavelength compatibility with YDFLs and Nd-doped solid-
state lasers, as well as the emergence of various fiber components for this spectral range, 1.06-µm SOA-based 
fiber lasers will potentially be used in generating ultrashort pulses.  Conventional single-mode fibers have 
normal dispersion at 1.06 µm; therefore, 1.06-µm SOA is an ideal test-bed for the experimental study on the 
dissipative soliton [5]. 
In this work we present a high-repetition-rate, 1.06-µm SOA-based fiber laser using a figure-8 cavity 
configuration and passive harmonic mode-locking (HML) technology.  At a constant SOA pump current, the 
pulse repetition rate can be tuned when the intracavity loss is changed by adjusting the polarization controllers 
(PCs).  Quasi-rectangular out pulses are also observed with the same cavity configuration. 
 
2. Experimental Setup 
Figure 1 shows the schematic of our SOA-based fiber laser cavity.  The figure-8 laser cavity contains two sub-
cavities which are connected via a 50/50 coupler.  The sub-cavity on the left is constructed by an isolator, a 
polarization controller, a 10/90 coupler with 10% output, and fiber jumpers made of HI-1060 fibers.  The 
isolator ensures uni-directional laser oscillation in this sub-cavity.  The length of this sub-cavity can be adjusted 
by inserting different lengths of fiber jumpers.  The sub-cavity on the right consists of SOA and PC, which 
works as a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror (NALM) [1].  The SOA (Innolume SOA-1060-20-PM-32dB) has 
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) center wavelength of 1060 nm and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) 
bandwidth of 35 nm, and the saturation output power is 21 dBm.  All the connections used in this figure-8 cavity 
are FC/APC.  Operation states of the SOA-based fiber laser are monitored by using a high-speed InGaAs 
photodetector and a digital oscilloscope ((LeCroy LT372). The laser output is then characterized by an optical 
spectrum analyzer (OSA, Ando AQ-6315) and a radio frequency (RF) spectrum analyzer (HP 8650E). 
Table 1 shows the average output power and the corresponding pulse repetition rate.  The SOA-based fiber 
laser shows a tendency of increasing the pulse repetition rate with the output power.  This might be caused by 
the short excited-state lifetime (about sub-nanosecond) of the SOA gain medium.  When the laser operates at 
low repetition rates, the short excited-state lifetime will lead to large averaged excited-state population loss.  
Therefore, the laser tends to work at the high-order HML states with pulse spacing comparable to or even larger 
than the excited-state lifetime. 
 
Table 1. Pulse repetition rate and average laser output power 
Repetition rate 
(GHz) 0.336 0.459 0.672 0.804 1.08 1.13 1.28 1.48 1.55 1.75 
Output power 
(dBm) -7.4 -5.8 -5.2 -5.8 -4.3 -3.2 -3.1 -2.9 -2.7 -2.8 
 
 
When the SOA pump current is increased to 200 mA, the pulse repetition rate can be reduced to 135 MHz.  
The reason that the laser can operate at a lower repetition rate should be attributed to the increased gain at higher 
pump currents.  Nevertheless, we have not observed fundamental mode-locking (FML) in this SOA-based fiber 
laser.  The laser will either operates at continuous-wave state or high-order HML states.  By carefully adjusting 
the PCs at pump current of 300 mA, we have obtained quasi-rectangular pulses [Fig. 4(a)], and the pulse 
repetition rate is reduced to 35 MHz.  The pulses have duty cycle of about 50%, and have overshoots at their 
leading edges.  As shown in Fig. 4(b), there are several spectral peaks existing in the optical spectrum of quasi-
rectangular pulses.  The wavelength spacing between adjacent peaks is about 1.4 nm, which is close to the 
longitudinal mode-spacing of the parasitic Fabry-Perot etalon form by the residual reflection from the AR-
coated SOA surfaces.

4. Conclusion 
High-order passive harmonic mode-locking has been achieved in a normal-dispersion figure-8 laser cavity based 
on a 1060-nm SOA gain medium.  By adjusting polarization controllers, the repetition rate can be tuned from 
336 MHz to 1.75 GHz thanks to the change of intracavity loss at fixed SOA pump current of 100 mA.  The 
SOA-based fiber laser shows a tendency of increasing the pulse repetition rate with average output power and 
the fundamental mode-locking state is not observable.  This might be caused by the short excited-state lifetime 
of the SOA gain medium.  We have observed quasi-rectangular output pulses in this cavity, and the pulse 
shaping might be attributed to the combined effect of spectral filtering and incomplete mode-locking.
