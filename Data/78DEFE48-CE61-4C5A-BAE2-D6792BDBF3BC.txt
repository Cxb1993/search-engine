Abstract 
An innovative prosthetic hand prototype is 
completed in this research. In order to increase 
the grasping stability, an underactuated finger is 
embedded in a traditional gripper. The weight of 
the prosthetic hand is 761 g, and there are a total 
of three motors employed in the hand system: 
the gripper, the embedded finger, and the wrist. 
The specifications of the gripper are as follows: 
the maximum grasping force is 11.07 N, the 
maximum closing speed is 1100 mm/sec and the 
maximum opening width is 200 mm. The max-
imum pinch force and minimum closing time for 
the embedded finger is about 4.5 N and 0.3 sec, 
respectively. The maximum rotational angle and 
rotational speed for the wrist is 300° and 
380°/sec, respectively. The preliminary perfor-
mance showed that this prosthetic hand was ca-
pable of performing various daily jobs, such as 
holding a driver, a telephone, a pen, etc., and 
this embedded finger provided extra grasping 
stability when the hand was holding small ob-
jects. The performance of this innovative pros-
thetic hand prototype shows the idea of embed-
ded finger is promising.

II. MECHANICAL DESIGN OF THE PROSTHETIC HAND 
The mechanical design of the prototype of this innovative 
prosthetic hand is shown in Fig. 2. An underactuated finger is 
embedded in the gripper. This embedded finger is composed of 
three phalanges as shown in Fig. 3(b). The first phalanx is fixed 
to the longer finger of the gripper. The second and the third 
phalanges can flex by pulling cables attached to their pulleys 
and can restore to the original positions with the help of the 
extension springs as shown in Figs. 3(a) and (c). Because the 
finger has two degrees of freedom (DOF) but one motor, it 
becomes an underactuated system. The gripper consists of two 
fingers. A motor is connected to the longer finger of the gripper, 
and then the longer finger and the shorter finger of the gripper 
can open and close together by using a coupler as shown in Fig. 
4(a) and (b). The wrist is directly connected to a motor to allow 
it to be able to rotate. From the previous discussion, it is 
understood that the prosthetic hand has four degrees of freedom 
in total.  
As described previously, the gripper and the embedded 
finger are driven independently by their own motors. If the 
object to be held is small or irregularly-shaped, the embedded 
finger can stick out of the longer finger of the gripper as shown 
in Fig. 4(c) to increase the grasping stability.

III. KINEMATICS OF THE GRIPPER 
The longer finger, the shorter finger, and the coupler of the 
gripper comprise a four-bar linkage as shown in Fig. 5(a). We 
use a, b, c, d to denote the linkage lengths, and θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4 to 
denote the angles between the linkages and the horizontal axis 
as shown in Fig. 5(b). Here θ1 is a fixed value because it is the 
angle of the fixed link. The input angle is θ2 and the output 
angle is θ4. From Fig. 5(b), we can derive

VI. EVALUATION RESULTS 
The prosthetic hand prototype was tested for its 
performance and the results are listed in TABLE I. The total 
weight of the mechanism and the three motors is 721 g. The 
maximum grasping force for the gripper is 2 kg and the 
maximum pinch force for the embedded finger is 0.3 kg. Both 
the gripper and the embedded finger can finish their movement 
in approximately 0.20 sec. We also used this prosthetic hand to 
perform some daily jobs as shown in Fig. 8, such as turning a 
key, grasping rods of various sizes, pinching a card, etc. This 
prosthetic hand can complete these jobs without problems. The 
performance of the prosthestic hand

VII. CONCLUSIVE REMARKS 
An innovative prosthetic hand prototype is presented in this 
paper. The major difference between this hand and the other 
prosthetic hand is that an underactuated finger is embedded in 
the traditional gripper. This embedded finger provides extra 
grasping stability when the hand is holding small objects.  
There are four degrees of freedom for this prosthetic hand and 
three DC servo motors employed. The total weight of the 
mechanism and the motors is 721 g. Because this is only a 
prototype, the weight can be further reduced by optimizing the 
mechanical structure and choosing light-weight micro motors 
with high torque output. The closing time of both the gripper 
and the embedded finger is around 0.2 sec, which is relatively 
short compared to the other similar prosthetic hands. The hand 
prototype is capable of performing a lot of daily jobs according 
to our evaluation. Further improvement on the gripper and the 
embedded finger of this prosthetic hand will be performed to 
allow them to handle more objects of different sizes and shapes 
as well as increasing their grasping forces.
