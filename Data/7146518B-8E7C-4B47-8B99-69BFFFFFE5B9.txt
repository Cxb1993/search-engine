英文摘要 
Along with the knowledge accumulation, the science and technology progresses 
continually. Until now also developes each kind of perfect armamentarium to solve and 
improve the human life. In order to make the cancer cell apoptosis or necrosis, recent 
cryosurgery treatment methods mostly use ultra-low temperature to rapidly freeze the 
treated cells to minus 196 degrees by using liquid nitrogen or other liquids. In fact, 
experimental observation indicated that the temperature doesn’t need to be ultra-low to be 
able to suppress the percentage of the cancer cell survival. In this paper, refrigerator 
thermostats ( AR-15S ) was utilized as a cooling system to dissipate the heat at the hot 
side of thermoelectric chip ( TEC - 40mm × 40mm × 4.0mm ), which results the 
temperature at cold side of thermoelectric chip of about minus 41 degrees. According to 
the data of the cultivated breast cancer cell in 96 wells placed on the thermoelectric chip 
to be conducted freezing, we discovered the temperature shouldn’t be ultra-low to make 
the breast cancer cell death and we observed that the main factor suppressing the breast 
cancer is freezing. Specifically, freezing makes the cell starting apoptosis or necrosis to 
suppress the breast cancer cell effectively. According to the data, the breast cancer cell 
under thw defferent degree to be the freeze experiment and at various regions freeze 2.5 
min, 5 min, 7.5 min and 10 min respectively. When the tempture is lower, the survival 
percentage reduces relatively; and the freezing times are longer, then the survival 
percentage of breast cancer cell is also be lower. The various regions freezing times are 
longer then the average of freezing data is lower at defferent tempture. Under the -30 °C, 
10 minutes freezing experiment, we compared with the direct and after three days survival 
percentage of breast cancer cell are not obvious restoration situation. The breast cancer 
cell under the low tempture made freezes and measure the survival percentage as good as 
only used the doxorubicin in medicine to suppress the cancer cell survival percentage. 
Due to doxorubicin had intense side effect, for example : palpitation, vomit, disgusting 
and so on. For reducing side effect of the medicine and hope to decrease medication 
dosage. Further combine freezing and medicine to reduce freezing time and medication 
dosage then achieve the same effect of suppressing cancer cell. Normally, using the 
ultra-low temperature cryotherapy method will damage、 frostbite and necrosis the 
surrounding healthy cells and tissues. It is evident that, non-ultra-low temperature 
freezing method could reduce the injury ( i.e. frostbite, necrosis and so on ) of the 
surrounding healthy cells and tissues and use the lowest energy to achieve the injury 
effect. In this research, the breast cancer cell under low tempture made the influence of 
freezes effectively in cryosurgery and the freezing and medicine suppress the cancer cell 
analysis of correlation.

二、與會心得 
 
  此研討會，本人深感收穫良多，尤其在各方的激盪與討論之下，又構思出新的研究方
向可提供回國之後在自己的實驗室中研發，並在認識新的實驗室之後提出合作的計畫，或
是互訪對方實驗室的承諾。在如此的過程中，本人受益良多，惟有些感慨有些資質優秀的
碩士班學生無法前來。目前國科會計畫只能補助博士班學生參加國外的研討會，而不資助
碩士班。在美國的體制下只要進入研究所便是具有進行研究能力的研究生，不管是碩士生
或是博士生皆是一視同仁，對於做研究的廣度必須長時間的薰陶，台灣不提供碩士生出國
發表，是否可以放寬標準，讓資質優異碩士生在做研究之餘，有一個鼓勵的刺激以外文來
發表論文，更提升他們的國際視野。 
 
  此次有來自世界各國的作品，而中國由於是地主國，所以佔大多數，關於微型幫浦的
成果並不多，相較之下，我們實驗室的成果是相當稀少，我們應該多鼓勵我們的研究生，
南台科技大學的研究成果在國際舞台是毫不遜色的，增加學生對自己所學、所研究的成果
更具有信心。

sequencing  of  classical  spins,  and  as  the  matter  of  fact  this 
results  from  the  sequencing  of  the  orientation  of  magnetic 
moments.  So,  the  magnetization  of ferro-magnets  results  not 
only in the appearance  of a collective  magnetic  field,  but in 
appearance  of  a  collective  torsion  field  as  well.  Thus,  any 
permanent  magnet  possesses  its  own  torsion  field.  This  fact 
was   first   experimentally    discovered    by   A.I.Veinik    [1]. 
Otherwise, according to many researchers, if any substance has 
polarization,  it will have its own torsion  field. Therefore,  for 
our   experiment   in   which   drinking   water   is   a   polarized 
substance, it naturally has “torsion field”. Moreover, according 
to [1], the structure of the torsion field of every physical object 
can  be  altered  by the  influence  of  an  external  torsion  field.

Thus,  it is expected  that  the “torsion  field”  of water  will be 
effected  by the  external  torsion  field  –  permanent  magnet’s 
torsion field and the magnetic field of permanent magnets. 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL  SET UP AND PROCEDURE 
In  order  to  examine  whether  or  not  the  “torsion  field” 
affect   to   the   formation   of   hexagonal   water   crystal,   we 
conducted   an   experiment   with   permanent   magnets   with 
different  number  of  permanent  magnet  pairs:  one  pair,  two 
pairs  and  three  pairs  which  was  showed  in figure  2.  Water 
after  taking  from  water  fountain  was  treated  with  “torsion 
field”  of permanent  magnets  in cases  of one  pair, two pairs 
and three  pairs in 24 hours.  After  treatment  with permanent 
magnets,  water  was  divided  into  10  petri  dish  samples  per 
position:  top,  middle  and  bottom  with  different  strength  of 
magnetic field in each case of quantity of permanent  magnets 
which was clearly illustrated in figure 2.

Subsequently,   all  samples  were  frozen  at  -230C  in  the 
refrigerator.  After 3 hours, the frozen samples were examined 
by   utilizing   microscope   placed   in   another   freezer   with 
crystallization  condition  to observe  the  growth  of  the  water 
crystal.  We used  NIS  – Elements  D version  3.0 program  to 
capture the hexagonal shapes of water crystal. All equipments 
were described in figure 3. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Through  observing  the empirical  results,  we realized  that 
the water under effect of “torsion field” of permanent magnets 
had  the  higher  rate  of  hexagonal  water  crystal  than  that  of 
water   without   treatment   with   permanent   magnets.   These 
results   revealed   a  stable   and   perfect   hexagonal   structure 
during melting process under observation through microscope. 
However,  each  position  including  top,  middle,  and  bottom 
corresponding  to different  strength  of magnetic  field had the 
different  appearance  proportion  of  hexagonal  water  crystal. 
This  proved  that  the  strength  of  magnetic  field  or  “torsion 
field”  of  permanent   magnets  had  a  strong  impact  on  the 
formation of water crystal. 
In order  to express  clearer  how  the strength  of magnetic 
field of permanent  magnets  or “torsion  field” affected  to the 
hexagonal  water crystal,  we divided  into three ranges:  under 
1500  gausses,  from  1500  to  3000  gausses  and  over  3000 
gausses.  The results obtained  from below 1500 gausses  were 
displayed   in  figure   4.  Although   these   pictures   also   had 
hexagonal   shape  in  the  center  and  form  hexagonal   water 
crystal,  these shapes seemed  to be imperfect.  In the range of 
1500 gausses- 3000 gausses, the formation of hexagonal water 
crystal was more perfect than that in the range of smaller than 
1500 gausses, which was illustrated  in figure 5 and 6. In this 
range,  the  appearance  rate  of  hexagonal  water  crystal  was 
higher  than  two  other  ranges,  which  was  often  from  1 to 4 
successful samples in 30 samples.

crystal  which  is  showed  above.  Based  on  these  results,  the 
impact  mechanism  of permanent  magnet’s  “torsion  field”  on 
water  crystal   was  initially  explained   as  following   reason. 
According   to  these   issues   that  is  initially   presented   ,  if 
anything  polarized,  it had its own “torsion  field”. In the case 
of  water  molecule,  it  was  a  polar  molecule,  with  a marked 
electric dipole moment of 1.83 D (1D = 1 Debye = 3.34 x 10-30 
C.m  = 0.21  eǺ) [3], so the water  molecules  contained  their 
“torsion  field”  and they are affected  of the external  “torsion 
field”  of  permanent  magnets.  Under  the  effect  of  external 
“torsion field”, the polarity of water molecule increased which 
is  pointed  out  in  [3]  that  the  electric   dipole  moment   of 
individual  H2O molecules  in ice Ih  (hexagonal ice) was of the 
order of 3.1 D (according to the properties of dipole moment: 
“the greater the dipole moment was, the greater the polarity in 
such a molecule  was”). This increased  polarity will make the 
H–O–H angle of water molecule slightly changed, from 104.50 
in liquid water to in the vicinity of 1060  in ordinary ice[3] and 
108.40  ±0.20  in Ih [5]. 
According to [6], the increase in hydrogen bond length has 
been  correlated   with  the  hydrogen   bond  strength  and  the 
resultant O–H stretch vibrations.  Thus O…O distances within 
clusters were likely to be shorter than those at the periphery, in 
agreement   with   the   icosahedral   cluster   model.   When   a 
hydrogen  bond  was  formed  between  two  water  molecules, 
there was hydrogen bond cooperativity.  Cooperative hydrogen 
bonding  increased  the  O  –  H  bond  length  while  causing 
reduction in the H … O and O…O distance [6]. It meant that 
short hydrogen  bonds in water were strongly  correlated  with 
them   being   straighter.    So,   if   the   hydrogen    bond   was 
substantially  bent then it followed  that the bond strength  was 
weaker.   The   main   criteria   to   determine   the   strength   of 
hydrogen  bonds  were  their (relatively  inaccurately 
determined)  intermolecular  distances  and  the  (more  precise) 
wavenumbers  of their stretching  vibrational  modes and those 
of the donor hydrogen  covalent  bond. From the evidences  of 
measurements   in  other  researches,  the  wavenumber   of  the 
stretching  intermonomer  band in ice Ih  appeared  at 214 cm
-1, 
which was greater than that in liquid water, only 200 cm-1  [3]. 
This  proved  that  the  frequency  of  translations  of  individual 
H2O molecules in Ih  was greater than that in liquid water and, 
moreover,  under the backup  of another  specific  frequency  of 
external “torsion field”, the O – H bond length increased being 
correlated with the weaker the O – H covalent bond was. This 
resulted  in  the  H…O  bond  length  in  ice  was  shorter  and 
hydrogen  bonds,  concerning  hydrogen  atom  lies  on a direct 
line between  the two oxygen  atoms,  straighter  than in liquid 
water  which  created  more  stable and more perfect  hydrogen 
bonds  network  in ice.  Another  reason  that  supported  to the 
formation of hydrogen bond network in ice was polarization of 
individual    water   molecules.    As   discussed   above,   water 
treatment  with external  “torsion  field” of permanent  magnets 
will  make  individual  water  molecules  more  polarized  (the 
electric   dipole   moment   of   individual   H2O   molecule   in 
hexagonal   ice  was  larger  than  that  in  liquid  water)   that 
reduced the hydrogen  bond length, is expected to increase  its 
covalency  and this will increase  the hydrogen  bond  network 
stability relative to purely electrostatic  effects [6]. In addition, 
during   melting   phase   of  ice,  water   molecules   and  water 
clusters   dislocated    and   packed   close   together    that   we 
mentioned in [4], it is clearly showed that the hexagonal water 
crystal   appeared   more   in   water   having   treatment   with 
permanent magnets than in that without treatment. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
The empirical revealed that the drinking water under effect 
of “torsion field” of permanent  magnets had the higher rate of 
hexagonal  water  crystal  than that of water without  treatment. 
These results showed that in the range of 1500 gausses-  3000 
gausses,  the  formation  of  hexagonal  water  crystal  was  more 
perfect than that in the range of smaller than 1500 gausses. In 
this range, the appearance  rate of hexagonal  water crystal was 
higher  than  two  other  ranges,  which  was  often  from  1 to  4 
successful  samples  in 30 samples.  Especially,  the  hexagonal 
water crystal  in the range  of 2200 – 3000 gausses  was more 
complicated  and  dendritic  than  that  related  to  1500  –  1600 
gausses.   In the remained  range  of magnetic  field, over 3000 
gausses,    we    exceptionally    discovered    the    decrease    of 
proportion  of hexagonal  water  crystal.  The perfect and stable 
hexagonal  shapes  seldom  appeared  in the case 24-hour  water 
treatment   with   permanent   magnets.   In   addition,   we   also 
conducted the experiments with 15-hour and 48-hour treatment 
with two other kinds of higher  quality water (oxygenizer  and 
Evian water) in the case of three pairs of permanent magnets. It 
is  revealed that the results of 15-hour treatment had the same 
trend  with  24-hour  treatment  mentioned  above,  the  rate  of 
perfect  hexagonal  water  crystal  was  small  (majority  of  one 
successful sample in the total of 30 samples and the successful 
time was seldom (until now, we only got 2 successful  time in 
the  total  of  over  15  experimental  times)).For  the  remaining 
case, it had no result for 48-hour  treatment.  This proved  that 
the water treatment time with permanent magnets effects to the 
formation of hexagonal water crystal. 
 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT 
We  specially  thank  to professor  Chun-Rong  Lin  working  at 
Department   of  Mechanical   Engineering,   Southern   Taiwan 
University,  Tainan,  Taiwan  help  us measure  the  strength  of 
magnetic   field  of  permanent   magnets  during  experimental 
process.
