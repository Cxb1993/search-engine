Abstract 
 
This study developed a snake robot 
with a flexible body, which can be controlled 
by cell phones based on the Global System 
for Mobile Communication (GSM). The 
snake robot is formed by connecting AI 
motors in a row. The AI motors we used are 
a kind of servo motor which can be identified 
by its corresponding identification number in 
series. ATMEL 89C51, a single chip, was 
chosen as the controller. It received control 
signal encoded by a GSM module through 
I/O ports in the controller, which is the Dual 
Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) signal 
generated by pushing buttons on cell phones, 
via the GSM. After identifying the signals, 
the controller executes the command and 
controls the motors of the snake robot via its 
serial port. The developed snake robot can be 
successfully controlled with a cellphone from 
different parts of Taiwan as long as where 
GSM network is available. We also equipped 
the snake robot with wireless CCD cameras 
to retrieve the image information of the 
environment the robot was in and we could, 
therefore, make decisions accordingly. In 
summary, this research developed a snake 
robot with a flexible body, which can be 
controlled remotely and serve a good test 
platform for further studies on dynamics, 
control and bionics.

I. Introduction 
 
The idea of Biomimetic Robot is derived 
from living creatures and put into practice by 
means of modern engineering techniques. 
The research domain includes imitating the 
structure, behavior, function and even 
thinking patterns of living organisms. Of all 
the creatures in the world, snakes have the 
advantage of overcoming obstacles because 
of its mobility and they have access to many

This AI motor provides two modes of 
operation—position-sending mode and 
360-degree rotation mode with maximum 
torque of 7kg．cm. A microprocessor was 
embedded inside the AI motor, which enables 
sending signals serially. 
 
1.  Imaging Apparatus 
 
Two sets of JK-007A wireless mini 
cameras (Figure 4) and an HC-00A wireless 
Audio/Video transmitter (Figure 5, right) 
were mounted on the snake robot. 
 
 
The purpose of this is to monitor the 
surroundings around the snake robot and as a 
reference for decision making.  
 
 
 
Figure 5: HC-00A wireless audio/video 
          transmitter and receiver module 
 
The image retrieved by the mini camera 
is sent back to the operator by using a video 
transmitter and receiver module. The 
transmitter weighs 41g, with the size of 
44×37×12(unit: mm). It was chosen in that 
it’s light and handy for the robot and with 
several channels available. 
 
The image received by the receiver 
(Figure 5, left) is displayed in a TFT LCD 
monitor for the operator’s reference.  
 
2. The Controller for Snake robot 
 
We chose single chips, AT89C51, 
produced by ATMEL, as the microprocessors. 
They receive control signals from the DTMF 
decoder via one of their four I/O ports and 
executed the actions via serial ports 
connected to the robot.  
 
The electric power of the robot is 
provided by 8 rechargeable Ni-MH batteries 
produced by SANYO. We cascaded the 
batteries and got an expected supply voltage 
of 9.6 volts and capacity of 2500mAh. 
 
3. Communication Apparatus 
 
GSM module was adopted for the 
communication between the operator and the 
snake robot. This M2106 GSM module 
(Figure 6) was manufactured by WAVECOM 
and has 50 I/O pins (Figure 7). 
 
Two speaker pins of the GSM module 
are used to receive DTMF signals sent via 
GSM. When the GSM module communicates 
with computers, AT-Command is used.

    (JK-007A datasheet, 2006) 
 
The snake robot can be successfully 
controlled with a cellphone via GSM to 
perform certain motion in according to the 
commands to the snake robot. 
 
1.  Image Retrieving Test 
 
An image retrieved by a wireless mini 
camera on the robot was displayed on the 
LCD monitor and shown in Figure 10.

The transmitting power of the module is 
100mW, which is supposed to yield a 
transmission distance of 100 meters. 
According to our test, the real transmission 
distance was between 40 and 50 meter. For 
the moment, the image retrieving apparatus 
and the communication apparatus are of two 
different systems. Our future work is to 
integrate image retrieving part and 
controlling parts into GPRS or 3G module. 
 
2.  Communication Test 
 
The generality and telecommunicability 
of GSM were tested. Firstly, we used different 
brands of cellphones sending DTMF signals 
to verify the generality of GSM. The 
outcome is satisfactory and is listed in table 
1. 
  
After that, we conducted another test for 
verifying the telecommunicability of GSM in 
Tomotake Hall of our department. The 
operator, on the fourth floor, controlled the 
robot placed on different floors. The results 
are shown in table 2.

From the result above, we can 
successfully control the snake robot via GSM 
in the same building. Further test was carried 
out to verify the telecommunicability in the 
distance. The snake robot was placed on the 
campus at National Taiwan University and 
controlled from different parts of the island. 
The service providers also vary: including 
Taiwan Mobile (TWN), FarEast Tone (FET), 
and Chunghwa Telecom(CHT). The result is 
shown in table 3. 
 
From the results in table 3, it is proved 
that the snake robot is GSM controllable. For 
interference test, We examined 3 common 
frequency of RF: 0.9GHz, 1.2GHz, and 
2.4GHz, and found out that GSM is immune 
to these RF and can function normally.
