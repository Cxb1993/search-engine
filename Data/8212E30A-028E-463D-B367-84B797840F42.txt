Abstract
Pulsed-DC reactive sputtering was employed to make fully (0002)-textured AlN thin films
with different full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of (0002) rocking curve. The
piezoelectric coefficient d33 was quantitatively measured by piezoresponse force microscopy
(PFM). The obtained values were rationalized with the consideration of an enhancement
factor due to the strongly localized electric field under the tip, indicating that this approach
can be used reliably for d33 measurement. We found that d33 decreases with increasing FWHM.
In addition, the piezoresponse amplitude is almost constant from grain to grain, except along
the grain boundaries.

1. Introduction
Piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) thin films have attracted lots of attention for
applications to film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) [1-9]. This interest is justified by the
excellent chemical and electromechanical properties of AlN films and their compatibility with
standard silicon technology. It is commonly recognized that the piezoelectric properties of
AlN films are related to the crystal orientation, which is often evaluated by the full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray rocking curve of (0002) AlN reflection [10]. The
piezoelectric properties of AlN thin films can be measured indirectly by analyzing the
scattering parameters of an FBAR. The electromechanical coupling factor kt2 is then derived
by fitting the measured S21 spectra to theoretical computations [11]. On the other hand, direct
measurements of the effective piezoelectric coefficient d33 using interferometry are also
commonly used [12-14]. Nevertheless, both of the abovementioned methods are examining
the macroscopic piezoelectric response of the films.
Knowing that the macroscopic piezoelectric response is the result of the contributions of all
grains with their individual dipoles, we thus tried to use the piezoresponse mode AFM,
sometimes called piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), to measure the inverse piezoelectric
effect of the films in the nanoscale regime, and to correlate the texture of the AlN thin films
with such measured d33. In the basic experimental scheme, the AlN is fabricated on a bottom
electrode and a conductive AFM tip is used as the top electrode. By applying a small AC
voltage between the tip and the bottom electrode, the tip vibration amplitude caused by the
inverse piezoelectric effect is determined and the d33 can be obtained. By locating the tip at
different locations on the AlN surface, study of nanoscale variation of the piezoelectric effect
4growing films, and thus increase the mobility of the adatoms to move themselves to the lattice
sites towards equilibrium, i.e., to form closest-packed planes with lowest surface energies. In
fact, the energy delivered to the growing film is sufficiently high, especially in our case of
pulsed-DC sputtering where its intrinsically high plasma activity [16] plays an important role,
so that fully (0002)-textured (texture coefficient = 1) AlN films and fully (110)-textured
(texture coefficient = 1, too) Mo films are readily obtainable with neither substrate heating nor
substrate biasing. The AlN (0002) rocking curves for both the LBP and HBP samples are
shown in Fig. 2 (b). The larger FWHM (5.1o) for the HBP sample compared to that of the
LBP sample (1.4o) has been proven to be due to oxygen contamination [17].
The PFM analyses are shown in Figs. 3 (a) and (b) for both the LBP and HBP samples,
respectively. The tip vibration amplitude was basically equal to the product of the lock-in
signal and the AFM detector sensitivity. The lock-in signals, 1.19 and 1.02 mV/V for Figs. 3
(a) and (b) respectively, had to be divided by ten since the deflection output was amplified ten
times compared to the internal deflection signal for the D3100 AFM. On the other hand, the
detector sensitivities, 168.8 and 166.7 nm/V for Figs. 3 (a) and (b) respectively, were
determined from several force-distance plots after the scanner was calibrated using a standard
grating. In addition, an enhancement factor F had to be included since the electric field in the
sample was highly non-uniform. Strong localization of the field under the tip was expected
due to the ultra-small tip diameter (~100 nm). F was estimated as t/5r ~ 6.4, where t was the
film thickness (~1.6m) and r the tip radius (~50 nm), respectively [18]. The values of d33
were thus calculated as 3.15 and 2.65 pm/V for the LBP and HBP samples, respectively. It is
noted that this dependence of d33 on the FWHM of (0002) rocking curve is in agreement with
Dubois et al. [12], rather than with Tonisch et al. [14]. Last but not least, the somewhat
smaller-than-expected values of the measured d33 must have something to do with the facts
that the piezoelectric film was clamped to a substrate, and that each small excited region was
clamped by the surrounding columnar grains in a polycrystalline AlN film.
Finally, the topography (left) and piezoresponse amplitude (right) images of the HBP sample
are shown in Fig. 4. A 9 V modulation voltage was applied to the tip of AFM. It is found that
the piezoresponse amplitude is almost constant from grain to grain, except along the grain
boundaries where the disordered structures do not afford much piezoelectricity.
4. Conclusions
We have quantitatively measured the piezoelectric coefficient d33 by PFM for two pulsed-DC
sputtered AlN films with different FWHMs of (0002) rocking curve. The obtained values are
reasonable, indicating that this approach can be used reliably for d33 measurement. It is found
that d33 decreases with increasing FWHM. In addition, the piezoresponse amplitude is almost
constant from grain to grain, except along the grain boundaries.
