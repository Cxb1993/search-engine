All of these problems increased the medical liability and raised up patient-care issues in the 54 
clinical use of paclitaxel. Therefore, paclitaxel formulations using biocompatible carriers devoid of 55 
Cremophore EL to provide sufficient solubility and activity of paclitaxel have always been a 56 
challenge throughout the process of paclitaxel therapeutic development. So far, many attempts at 57 
paclitaxel formulation have been made using co-solvents, emulsions liposomes, mixed micelles, 58 
nanocapsules and microspheres, etc. [3, 8–15]. Moreover, as paclitaxel shows no activity by peroral 59 
way, most of the endeavours are concentrated on formulations via intravenous administration. 60 
The addition of co-solvents may be the most widely used solubilizing technique, because the 61 
co-solvents can increase solubility for many non-polar solubilizates [16]. For example, 75% 62 
polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400) in water has significantly improved the solubility of paclitaxel 63 
(up to 31 mg/mL). Furthermore, paclitaxel in such a formulation is found to be chemically stable for 64 
a period up to 14 days at 25°C by HPLC analysis. PEG is non-toxic and miscible with water, thus it 65 
seems to be more favourable than the current carrier using Cremophor EL®. However, it was found 66 
that the paclitaxel in an aqueous PEG-400 solution was less active against an IP-implanted B16 67 
melanoma tumor model than the current clinical formulation [17]. The PEG 400 formulation was 68 
also found to be slightly more toxic and gave a shorter life extension when compared with the 69 
current clinical formulation. Besides, precipitation was also observed upon dilution. When reducing 70 
PEG 400 concentration in water from 75 % to 35 %, paclitaxel’s solubility decreased dramatically 71 
from 31 mg/mL to 0.03 mg/mL. Therefore, this co-solvent system is regarded as inappropriate for a 72 
potential paclitaxel carrier. 73 
Tarr et al. [18] prepared a stable parenteral O/W emulsion that contained 50% triacetin, 74 
2.0% ethyl oleate, 1.5% Pluronic F68, 1.5% soybean oil and 10 mg paclitaxel. Glycerol was added 75 
up to 10% to prevent creaming. Paclitaxel solubility in triacetin is reported to be up to 75 mg/mL. 76 
The formulation can encapsulate a considerable amount of paclitaxel due to the excellent 77 
solubilization ability of triacetin. Paclitaxel was found to be chemically stable in the formulation for 78 
over six months, but the physical stability of the emulsion is poor. The growth of particle size was 79 
 5
formulation. Moreover, benzyl benzoate had been engaged in a nanocapsular system to encapsulate 106 
paclitaxel by Bartoli et al. [25]. Although benzyl alcohol and 2-phenylethanol were not involved as 107 
solvent candidates for paclitaxel delivery, they were engaged in some clinical research for poorly 108 
soluble drugs. Hammad and Müller [26] proposed a series of experiments to improve the solubility 109 
and stability of various poorly soluble drugs such as clonazepam, benzodiazepine, lorazepam and 110 
tetrazepam by mixed micelles of bile salt and soya phosphatidylcholine (SPC). It was found that the 111 
solubilizing capacity of the mixed micelles was increased to different extents by involving benzyl 112 
alcohol or 2-phenylethanol. According to the rule of thumb - “like dissolves like”, these alcohols 113 
containing benzyl and hydroxyl groups are expected to provide paclitaxel with high solubility.  114 
Hence, in this work, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) free of Cremophor 115 
EL® were developed with use of nonionic surfactants and EPC as emulsifiers. Tributyrin, benzyl 116 
alcohol, 2-phenylethanol and benzyl benzoate or their blends were selected to be the oil phases in 117 
the study for paclitaxel delivery due to their possibly high paclitaxel solubility and established 118 
pharmaceutical research records. As a result, emulsion formulation containing paclitaxel near 500 119 
ppm could be achieved. 120 
 121 
2. Materials and methods: 122 
2.1 Materials 123 
Paclitaxel was obtained from Scino Pharm Taiwan, Ltd. (Tainan, Taiwan), and from Bristol-124 
Myers Squibb (Princeton, NJ, USA) as a gift. Tween surfactants, L-α-phosphatidylcholine purified 125 
from egg yolk (EPC, with a PC content near 60%), powder-blends of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), 126 
glycerol tributyrate (tributyrin), glycerol trioctanoate (tricaprylin), 2-phenylethanol, benzyl alcohol, 127 
benzyl benzoate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Span 128 
20 and Span 80 were acquired from Fluka. Glycerol trihexanoate (tricaproin) was bought from 129 
Tokyo Kasei (TCI), Japan. Glycerol and HPLC-grade methanol were purchased from Mallinckrodt 130 
Baker. Edible peanut oil was obtained from Tesco. Deionized water from a Millipore’s Milli-Q ultra 131 
 7
ratios were mixed with oils in an attempt to form stable O/W emulsions. On the initial screening of 158 
surfactant mixtures, benzyl alcohol was employed as the model oil. Later on, tributyrin, benzyl 159 
alcohol, 2-phenylethanol and benzyl benzoate were involved as a single or mixed oil phases for 160 
screening proper oil phases. Different oil combinations were attempted and selections were based 161 
on their solubilization capacity of paclitaxel and resulting size distributions of O/W emulsions. It is 162 
noted that mixed ratios of surfactants and oils reported in this work were all based by weight, not by 163 
mole.  164 
The selected emulsion systems were further investigated by loading paclitaxel. The amount 165 
of paclitaxel loaded in the oily stock should not exceed its estimated solubilization capacity in 166 
selected oil or oil blends. For simplicity, drug loading ratios at 5 and 10 mg paclitaxel per gram of 167 
oily stock were employed for study on drug encapsulation efficiency in this work. 168 
 169 
2.2.3 Stability of Emulsion Formulation 170 
Emulsions are not thermodynamically stable, unless the excess free-energy along oil-water 171 
interface is negligible. Therefore, degree of physicochemical stability of paclitaxel-containing 172 
emulsions is vital to success of emulsion formulation of paclitaxel. It is difficult to define a single 173 
index that can be used to evaluate emulsion stability. The visual inspection and emulsion size are 174 
the commonly accepted indices for emulsion stability. 175 
In this study, the physical stability of the emulsions with/without paclitaxel loaded during 176 
the prolonged storage, both as a function of storage time and temperature, was determined by size 177 
measurements with dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique on emulsions and by visual inspection 178 
at regular time intervals. Stable systems were identified as those free of any physical phase-change, 179 
such as color change, phase separation, flocculation and/or precipitation. It is of note that only clear 180 
or translucent emulsions were subject to DLS size measurements on emulsions (Section 2.4).  181 
Chemical stability of emulsion formulation was examined by observing degradation extent 182 
and encapsulation efficiency of paclitaxel in our emulsion systems. The HPLC was employed to 183 
 9
Light scattering technique offers many advantages compared to other techniques available 209 
for particle sizing. It is fast, versatile, small sample-size and non-destructive in the liquid phase. In 210 
this study the emulsion size was measured with a laser light scattering analyzer purchased from the 211 
Brookhaven Instruments Corp. (NY, USA) using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method. This 212 
system consists of a BI-2000SM motor-driven goniometer, an advanced BI-9000AT digital 213 
autocorrelator, an argon-ion laser (Model 95/2, Lexel), and BI-DLSW control software. The DLS 214 
measurements were carried out at 24°C and with a scattered angle at 90°. Contin® method was 215 
employed with pre-determined viscosities and refractive indices of emulsions to calculate size 216 
distribution and polydispersity of emulsions. Unless specified, all diameters shown in the results are 217 
mean diameters of emulsions based on the weight distribution.  218 
 219 
3. Results and Discussion: 220 
3.1 Paclitaxel Solubilities in Various Oils and Alcohols 221 
As mentioned previously, to increase the apparent aqueous solubility of hydrophobic 222 
paclitaxel, it is desired to have more paclitaxel dissolved in the oil phase that can be further 223 
incorporated as hydrophobic cores of emulsions formed with proper surfactants. That is, oils with 224 
higher solubilization capacities of paclitaxel are good candidates to fit the objectives of this work. 225 
Previously, triglycerides with shorter alkyl chains, for example, triacetin and tributyrin, were found 226 
to have higher solubility of paclitaxel. However, triacetin may bring up more adverse side effects 227 
and, therefore, it was not included as oil candidates to be tested in this work. 228 
Paclitaxel solubilities in various oils including triglycerides and esters, and in alcohols were 229 
measured (Table 1). Among these oils, benzyl alcohol was found to possess the highest paclitaxel 230 
solubility at a value more than 30 mg/g. Tributyrin, 2-phenylethanol and benzyl benzoate can 231 
dissolve paclitaxel at about 10 mg/g, 25 mg/g and 18 mg/g, respectively. The paclitaxel solubilities 232 
in triglycerides decrease remarkably with longer alkyl chains. Similarly, ethyl decanoate has better 233 
paclitaxel solubility than ethyl dodecanoate. Moreover, ethyl decanoate (C12H24O2), ethyl 234 
 11
optimal formulations on compositions of surfactant mixtures, oil phases, and aqueous phases were 261 
sought in order to give as more paclitaxel as possible to be incorporated in emulsions that must be 262 
stable and have suitable size distribution, i.e. from ca. 80 to ca. 200 nm. 263 
A series of surfactant combinations were prepared and evaluated for giving proper 264 
emulsions having higher encapsulation of paclitaxel. Moreover, it is known that surfactants with 265 
HLB ranging value from 8 to 18 usually give O/W emulsions [16]. In order to get clear O/W 266 
emulsions, emulsions resulted from mixed surfactants having HLB values from 10 to 15 were 267 
prepared using benzyl alcohol as the oil phase (Table 2). By taking into account with oils 268 
incorporated in emulsion as more as possible and with suitable emulsion sizes, e.g. from 80 ~ 200 269 
nm, mixed surfactants from Tween 80 and EPC as well as those of Tween 80 and Span 80 would be 270 
desirably chosen. However, stability of emulsions resulted from mixed surfactants of Tween 80 and 271 
Span 80 were not as good as that from EPC and Tween 80. As a result, surfactant mixtures of 272 
Tween 80 and EPC were favorably selected as emulsifiers for further study on the emulsion 273 
formulations. 274 
Moreover, Tween 80 has been approved to be used as an incipient in drugs, for example, in 275 
Taxotere® (docetaxel injection). It has a relatively lower CMC (ca. 13 ~ 15 ppm, or nearly 0.01 276 
mM). The use of a surfactant with a lower CMC may increase the in vivo stability of the emulsion 277 
system, since the injectable drug-delivery vehicles often require dilution before injection or 278 
infusion. It is also reported that Tween 80 may contribute to counter multi-drug resistance [27]. 279 
Therefore, mixed emulsifiers of EPC/Tween 80 will be favorably involved in the following study 280 
with selected oils in this work. In fact, combined EPC/Tween 80 emulsifiers have already been 281 
employed in many clinical studies with a proven synergistic effect [19, 20]. However, in the open 282 
literature, studies reporting the use of these four oils chosen in this work are still not yet available.  283 
As aforementioned, the aqueous phase may also influence profoundly the emulsion stability. 284 
Aqueous solutions, such as D5W, PBS, 2.5 wt% glycerol, and deionized water were examined on 285 
their influences on resulted emulsions using EPC/Tween 80 (1:1 by weight) as emulsifiers, and 286 
 13
administration, the injectable paclitaxel solution is required to be stable chemically and physically 313 
stable for up to 27 hours according to the information on Taxol advised by the Bristol Myers-314 
Squibb Company [7]. Additionally, Figure 1 also indicates that average sizes of emulsions resulted 315 
from formulations using EPC/Tween 80 = 1 and 1.5 ranges from 100 to 200 nm for an extended 316 
periods of 15 days, except that with EPC/Tween 80 = 1.5 and total emulsifier/oil = 0.8.  317 
As expected, increasing the amount of total emulsifiers generally decrease the size of 318 
resulted emulsions, for example, to near 100 nm for a total emulsifier/oil ratio equal to 1. Hence, in 319 
this work, the weight ratio of total emulsifiers to oil was desirably set in between 0.6 and 0.8. 320 
Furthermore, if the oil contents in emulsions were increased to more than 3 wt%, unstable 321 
emulsions, with appearance changed from translucence to opaqueness, were usually formed. That is, 322 
the maximum amount of oil incorporated in emulsion formulations in this work was no more than 3 323 
wt%. 324 
Further studies on effects of oil-phase compositions and contents on the resulted emulsion 325 
were carried out subsequently. Mixtures and pure oils of benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, benzyl 326 
benzoate, and tributyrin were used (Table 3). Both benzyl alcohol and 2-phenylethanol used as oil 327 
phase resulted in emulsions having average sizes near 130 nm, suitable for purpose as drug-delivery 328 
carriers. However, benzyl benzoate and tributyrin used individually as the oil phase could not give 329 
emulsions with adequate sizes. Consequently, these two oils were rather used as mixed oils. 330 
Noticeably, though both benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate have very good solubilization capacity 331 
of paclitaxel, i.e. ca. 34.2 and 18.8 mg/L, the average sizes of emulsion having 3 wt% of mixed 332 
benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol are, however, unfavorably large at ca. 300 nm (Table 3). As a 333 
result, mixtures of benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol were discarded for further tests on 334 
containment efficiency of paclitaxel. In contrast, formulations resulting emulsions with average 335 
sizes less than ca. 200 nm in Table 3 were, hence, selected for further studies on paclitaxel 336 
encapsulation. 337 
 15
degraded under these conditions of storage. This observation confirmed with previous findings that 364 
use of an aqueous lipid emulsion as the final delivery vehicle could provide protection of drug 365 
against light exposure [28].  366 
 367 
3.3 Encapsulation of Paclitaxel in Emulsions 368 
Encapsulation of paclitaxel by these emulsion formulations were further studied using 369 
selected formulations shown in Table 3 that rendered average size of emulsions less than ca. 200 370 
nm (Table 4). The paclitaxel concentration in emulsions was measured after being stored for a 371 
certain period, shown as storage time in Table 4, from preparation of such emulsions. The 372 
emulsions were conditioned at ambient temperature for 30 minutes with gentle shaking prior to 373 
HPLC analysis. Moreover, initial loading of paclitaxel by oil phases were 5 or 10 mg/g oil, which is 374 
far less than its solubilities in oils studied in this work. 375 
For fresh emulsions, i.e., within a week from preparation, all formulations showed good 376 
encapsulation efficiency of paclitaxel greater than 85%. For example, emulsion made of 3 wt% oil 377 
blended from equal amount of benzyl alcohol and tributyrin with an initial loading of paclitaxel at 378 
540 ppm could still contain paclitaxel of ca. 500 ppm after a weeklong storage. Noticeably, 379 
clinically for intravenous administration of paclitaxel, the final concentration of paclitaxel ranges 380 
from 0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL, i.e. from 300 to 1200 ppm, and the solution must be physically and 381 
chemically stable for up to 27 hours at about 25°C [7].  382 
However, as the storage time increases, the encapsulation efficiency of drug generally 383 
decreases (Figure 4). That is, paclitaxel could still be gradually leaked out from emulsion carriers. 384 
For example, after being stored for 50 days, the encapsulation efficiency and concentration of 385 
paclitaxel in aforementioned emulsion system decreased from ca. 90% to 72% or, equivalently, 386 
from 500 ppm to 390 ppm. Interestingly, the leakage rate of paclitaxel from emulsions after a long 387 
period in storage increases with more paclitaxel loaded initially. A least-square linear fit of these 388 
data tells that about 7.7% per 100 ppm of paclitaxel more initially loaded in emulsions would be 389 
 17
EPC/Tween 80 from 0.7 to 1.5 and changing the weight ratio of total emulsifier to oil from 0.6 to 416 
1.0. Different oils or oil blends have been attempted in the lipid emulsion formula. Benzyl alcohol 417 
as a single oil phase and the combinations of benzyl alcohol and tributyrin, 2-phenylethanol and 418 
tributyrin as mixed oil phases appear to be good candidates for oil phases that provide appropriate 419 
particle size distribution, excellent physical stability and high drug containment. Paclitaxel can be 420 
retained without degradation in oily stocks, which contain drug and emulsifiers in oils, when stored 421 
at 4°C. To prepare paclitaxel-contained emulsions, only simple mixing procedures to blend oily 422 
stocks and aqueous diluents are required. The optimum formulation contains oils from 1 wt% to 3 423 
wt%, Tween 80 and EPC from 0.4 to 1.2 wt%, respectively, in the emulsions, . Thus, at least 500 424 
ppm of paclitaxel can be solubilized in emulsions. More importantly, the emulsion system is free of 425 
Cremophor EL® and water-based with good shelf stability even when stored at ambient 426 
temperature. It is also shown that the emulsion is compatible with commonly used injection fluids 427 
and no precipitation is observed upon dilution. 428

(3) 國際化：雖然 AIChE 冠有美國之名，然而與會者來自全世界各個國家，從
歐洲到亞洲、從大洋洲到南美洲均有。AIChE 可以說提供一個非常好的機會讓
來自世界各國的化工人可以進行面對面的討論。此外，在會議前三天晚上，很
多學校或公司會舉辦自助餐晚會，讓與會者在每一天的會議結束以後，彼此有
機會見面討論。而對舉辦單位來說，這也可以達到宣傳的效果。而值得我們注
意的是，在亞洲與會的各國學者或單位中，都有舉辦類似的餐會，例如日本化
工學會、新加坡大學化工系、新加坡南洋大學化工系、甚至韓國的化工學會。
在這些餐會中，各單位也非常努力的介紹本國化工界的技術發展，同時也提供
該國旅外的化工研究人員和本國化工界有双向交流、情報交換的機會。這非常
值得台灣教育部、國科會或台灣化工學會重視。因為在這裡花約美金 4000 元左
右少許的錢，便可以得到非常好的宣傳效果。 
 
除此之外，本人也爭取到在明年的年會中組織一場論文發表會，重點在於界
面活性劑的各種相行為及應用。 
 
建議事項： 
(1) 鼓勵台灣化工界相關學者或學生參與此年會。目前，台灣極希望能與國際在
