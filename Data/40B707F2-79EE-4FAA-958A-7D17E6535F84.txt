三、文獻探討
We began our research from literature survey on ex-
isting optimization algorithm. In [2] K. M. Passino
proposed a global random search algorithm based on
biomimicry of foraging behavior of E. Coli bacteria. The
algorithm consists of several stages, namely chemotaxis,
reproduction, and elimination, where the first stage pos-
sess high similarity in structure to the original algorithm
used in [1], and hencemotivated our study. ThoughBFA
had been applied in many fields of control systems and
optimization problems, most algorithms experience per-
formance loss or implementation difficulties under dis-
tributed systems. We implemented BFA in a distributed
manner, and our initial study shows that improvement
on decreasing average number of transmissions is ne-
glectable.
Only few distributed beamforming schemes were pro-
posed at the moment, one particular algorithm being the
pairwise algorithm presented by Prasanth Jeevan et al. in
[3]. Compared with [1], the author stated that pairwise
algorithm outperforms 1-bit feedback scheme by reduc-
ing 70% average number of transmissions and provides
robustness with the presence of up to 20% phase error
caused by distributed oscilators. We verified these char-
acteristics and yields similar results as claimed in the
literature. However, pairwise scheme requires perfect
phase correction, which is impossible to achieve under
limited feedback link. As the error in phase correction
increase, its performance degrades dramatically.
In the case where estimation error exists, the perfor-
mance gain from beamforming can be degraded. Sim-
ilarly, existence of interference and noise in relay net-
works bring negative impact if one wish to perform re-
lay beamforming. Optimal beamforming coefficients of
amplify-and-forward relaying with total power constrain
was discussed in [4], where received interference and
noise can be completely canceled out given exact cor-
relation knowledge.
四、研究目的與方法
The goal of the research is to find a more efficient
algorithm to search the optimum beamforming coeffi-
cients. To achieve this goal, the received SINR function
is investigated under different assumptions. If the ob-
jective function, i.e. the received SINR function, pos-
sesses no local maximum, we can apply local random
search algorithm, which converges rapidly, to find the
desired beamforming coefficients. If the objective func-
tion possesses local maximum, the local random search
algorithm would fail. Hence, we have to use a global
random search algorithm. However, it is hard to find the
global optimum within a finite number of function eval-
uations. Moreover, it is hard to verify whether we have
reached the global maximum.
In this research, we have found that there exists no
local maxima in the received SINR function in the four
cases discussed in this report and thus local random
search algorithm can still be applied as a simple method
to find the global maxima. Furthermore, different from
the original random search, we propose a new algorithm
termed “Random Search with Reverse Tracking,” which
will effectively improve the convergence time.
We consider the problem of distributed beamforming,
where ns transmitters seek to beamform a common mes-
sage to one receiver in a distributed manner. We assume
that each transmitter and the receiver is equipped with
one antenna, and that the channels from the transmit-
ters to the receiver are frequency-flat, slow fading. The
discrete-time, complex baseband system model over a
coherence interval is given by
y[t] =
ns∑
i=1
higi[t]si[t] + w[t] (1)
=
ns∑
i=1
aibi[t]e
j(φi+ψi[t])si[t] + w[t] (2)
where si[t] ∈ C is the estimation of transmitted common
message made by the ith sensor, y[t] ∈ C is the received
signal, and w[t] ∼ CN (0, σ2) corresponds to the addi-
tive white Gaussian noise. For transmitter i, we denote
the channel fading gains by hi = aiejφi ∈ C and beam-
forming coefficients by gi[t] = bi[t]ejφi[t] ∈ C. Note
that ai ≥ 0, bi[t] ≥ 0, and φi ∈ [0, 2pi], ψi[t] ∈ [0, 2pi]
for all i and t since they are the corresponding magni-
tudes and phases of hi and gi, respectively. Further-
more, ai and φi is considered to be time-invariant for all
i due to the assumption that the channels are slow fading.
We assume an average power constraint on s[t] given by
E[|s[t]|2] ≤ Ps.
The goal of the distributed beamforming is to pick the
beamforming coefficients {gi[t] = bi[t]ejφi[t]} to maxi-
mize the received SNR.
In the following, we consider four different cases:
(A) the received signal magnitude function with fixed
power, (B) with individual power constraint, (C) with
total power constraint, and (D) uncorrelated estimation

From the above two equations, we get

Therefore, all local maxima are global maxima.
D. Uncorrelated Estimation Error with Fixed Power at
Each Sensor
If there are estimation errors at sensor nodes, then we
can express the received signal as
y[t] =
ns∑
i=1
aibi[t]e
j(φi+ψi[t])(s[t] + ∆si[t]) + w[t]
=
ns∑
i=1
aibi[t]e
j(φi+ψi[t])s[t]
+
ns∑
i=1
aibi[t]e
j(φi+ψi[t])∆si[t] + w[t]
where∆si[t] is the estimation error at each sensor nodes
and is uncorrelated to the signal s[t] and across each
transmitter i. Since {∆si[t]}nsi=1 are i.i.d random vari-
ables, we can treat the estimation error as part of the
noise by Central Limit Theorem. In this case, our ob-
jective is to maximize the received SINR:
SINR =

∣∣∑ns
i=1 aibi[t]e

∣∣2
σ2 +
∑ns
i=1 a

i [t]]
Since the magnitude of the beamforming coefficients are
fixed, the denominator of the SINR function is a con-
stant. Therefore, our objective is to maximize the nu-
merator, and this is equivalent to (A). The SINR is max-
imized when all phases are aligned, and the maximal
value is
Ps

) ,
where Pi is the transmit power of the i-th sensor.
With the analysis in the four cases, we learnt that the
local maximum of the objective function in each case is
also the global maximum. As a result, we can use local
random search to find the global maxima.
Based on the adaptive distributed beamforming
scheme proposed in [4],[5] , we propose a novel scheme,
called ”Local Random Search with Reverse Tracking,”
that does not require extra feedback bits between fusion
center and sensor network, but provides less average
transmissions. Recall that the original algorithm con-
sists of three steps, namely Initialize,Update and Trans-
mit, and finally Compare and Select. By adding reverse
tracking, the new scheme consists four steps described
as follows:
Step zero: Initialize. As each transmitter controls its
own beamforming phase, one may set ψi[0] = 0, ∀i, and
therefore θi[0] = φi for transmitter i.
Step one: Update and Transmit. For each distributed
transmitter i a random perturbation δi[t] is generated
where {δi[t]}nsi=1 is i.i.d uniform random variables in
[−δ0, δ0] across time and transmitters. δ0 ∈ [0, pi] is
called ”stepsize”, a configurable parameter that remains
constant once decided at the beginning. Transmitters
then transmit with the new beamforming phase equal to
stored phase θi[t− 1] plus the random perturbation δi[t].
Step two: Reverse Tracking. The receiver will com-
pare the received signal strength (RSS) with the one re-
ceived in the previous time slot. If the newly transmit-
ted signal’s magnitude is larger than the previous value,
the receiver feeds back one-bit signal ”1”. On the other
hand, signal ”0” is sent in the feedback link if the re-
ceived signal strength is smaller. For transmitters, re-
ceiving ”1” means to keep the new beamfomring phase,
and the algorithm will return to step one after the new
phase is stored. In the case where ”0” is received, in-
stead of discarding the new beamforming phase as in the
original algorithm, transmitters will continue to transmit
signal with the beamforming phase equal to the stored
phase θi[t− 1] minus the random perturbation δi[t].
Step three: Compare and Select. The receiver will
again compare the RSS with the previous one. As in step
two, the receiver will transmit either ”1” or ”0” in feed-
back link according to the received magnitude. Trans-
mitters will save or discard the new beamforming phase
according to the feedback signal, and the algorithm will
return to step one.
To sum up, the new algorithm does one additional
transmission with each random perturbation if the first
beamforming phase result in a RSS is weaker than pre-
vious one. Specifically, θ[t] is equal to

θˆ1[t], RSS(θˆ1[t]) ≥ RSS(θ[t− 1])
θˆ2[t], RSS(θˆ2[t]) ≥ RSS(θ[t− 1])
θ[t− 1], o.w.

Table 1: Comparison of performance gain under differ-
ent size of networks
ing approximately 13% improvement in number of av-
erage transmissions. These results yield strong evidence
that reverse tracking scheme is an ideal substitution for
beamforming coefficient optimization algorithm under
all sizes of systems.
The four cases we discussed in this report are all with
good property, i.e. possess no local maximum, such that
we can apply our reverse tracking scheme to find the
optimum beamforming coefficients efficiently. In our
future work, we would like to investigate some more
complicate situations such as the correlated estimation
errors with individual or total power constraint. We be-
lieve that, in this case, the SINR function should possess
local maxima. Therefore, we should develop a powerful
global random search algorithm for solving this problem.
