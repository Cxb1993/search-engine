三、研究報告應含的內容 
(一) 前言 
為了追求更廣大的生活空間，更佳的生
活品質條件，生活中的器材和零件朝向微小
型化發展，其輕、薄、短、小的特性不但節
省空間、節省能源、節省材料及提高附加價
值外，還可以在製造技術成熟時，以量產方
式生產降低成本，故未來的加工技術必朝向
精密化及微細化元件發展。 
微細切削加工擁有較高之材料選擇性與
幾何形狀之彈性，可加工任意曲面且製程簡
單，更擁有較佳之相對精度。對銑削而言，
在實際產業應用上，刀徑小於 500μm 以下即
慣稱為微刀具，但這區分仍不是很明確[1]。
對於不同微加工製程所產生特徵尺寸與精度
關係，如圖 1 所示。以微切削加工而言，可
達精度約 0.1~1μm。 
微銑削加工具有加工效率高、低製造成
本與良好的加工精度等優點，加工範圍寬
廣，從數釐米至數十微米均可適用，因此日
益受到重視。微銑削用來生產精微元件的模
具尺寸微細，在加工上有基本的困難與問題
點， 
例如：尺寸效應、材料強度、刀具偏擺
等等。當微銑削高硬度的元件材料時，容易
導致刀具快速的磨耗或斷裂，而造成工件品
質不佳導致加工成本的上揚。 
現今透過高速電腦、數值模型與有限元
素分析，經由研究者處理所有控制參數來描 
 
圖 1 微細加工的尺寸與精度範圍[2] 
繪與分析加工過程，可以增加對金屬切削的
切屑形式機構的瞭解。 
在金屬切削時所做的功，幾乎全部轉變
為切削熱。大量的切削熱使刀面產生很高的
溫度，而切削時的溫度場對刀具磨耗、工件
材料性能的變化、已加工工件表面品質都有
很大的影響，因而對溫度的研究也顯得特別
重要。而實際加工過程量測刀具溫度是不容
易的，故還需藉由模擬來瞭解切屑形成的過
程，來得到一些不易量測與無法量測到的數
據，如切屑和工件的應力、應變及工件、切
屑的溫度分佈等物理變化，此數據將有助於
提高成品尺寸精度和改善成品品質。 
 
(二) 研究目的 
本研究計畫擬建構一套最佳化切削性能
的微小端銑刀開發模式，影響材料切削性能
的主要因素有刀具的幾何形狀與切削條件，
微小端銑刀的開發模式並非只是尺寸縮小的
問題，而是多面向必須考量如切屑的成形狀
況、刀具的幾何形狀、刀具研磨的製程分析、
實際銑削加工性能分析。首先利用 FEM 做微
小銑切時切屑的成形模擬分析，並做實驗驗
証，以瞭解微小銑削時的切削行為與切削性
能分析，再建構一套模組化微小端銑刀研磨
CAM 軟體，並利用五軸 CNC 工具磨床對微
小端銑刀做一系列的研磨實驗，進行分析研
磨品質與穩定度，有助於瞭解精微端銑刀研
磨特性。 
傳統切削研究是利用實驗方式來探討切
削的過程，如切削時產生的切削力、切削熱
傳導、材料與刀具性質等問題。雖然利用實
驗方法來研究切削行為可以獲得較接近真實
的切削數據，但是實驗方法不僅費時且成本
相當高，對於講求速度與適用性的現今社會
越來越不適用，因此必須尋找更快速、更簡
便、更具適用性的實驗方法來取代之。 
本研究目的是以 FEM 做微小銑切時切
屑的成形模擬分析為基礎，結合田口實驗設
計法與變異數分析。應用 DEFORM 軟體，建
立一套微小銑削 SKD61 模具鋼製程分析模
型，藉此模型可以瞭解切屑形成的過程，並
預測其刀具性能。以直交表規劃微小銑削模
擬實驗，製程參數包括有效 rake angle、離隙
角、切削速度和每刃進給等四個參數。評估

評估微小銑削製程之切削性能為刀具壽

數為可控制因子，各可控因子分別設定三個
水準，其切削速度的水準選擇是以機台的最

刀的最大每刃進給設定，有效 rake angle 是以
最常用之螺旋角 35 度與可研磨到最大徑向

自由度為 2(水準數-1)。本研究中四個可控制
因子水準數均為 3，因子總自由度為 8。同

此選用 L9(34)直交表。實驗佈置如表 2 所示。
刀具切削力、刀具最高溫度、刀具最高溫與
刀尖點距離與刀具與切屑之接觸長度等四項
品質特性與刀具壽命息息相關，故本研究選
擇這四項品質特性，作為評估切削性能的重

Jae-Chul Lee et al. [11] discussed how size and shape of gate affect 
the semi-solid flow. Results indicated that geometric shape and flow 
speed of gate could affect molten metal flow in the cavity.  
 
Gotz.C. Hartmann et al. [12] used CAE software to simulate metal 
flow. The gate and running system were found to directly influence 
the quality of casting. Poor design will cause air to flee around the 
runner, and air was forced to mix with molten metal to fill and solidify 
slowly, which could produce defects. Their research indicated that 
optimal gate and running systems were tried by different design of 
running system. Thus the products were best and perfect.  
 
B.H. Hu et al. [13] used hot-chamber die casting to cast magnesium 
alloy and CAE software was applied to design the gate and running 
system. The study changed the initial gate and running system design, 
slowed down filling speed and added a slug well at the final filling 
position. Results showed the flow was uniform and compared 
simulation results with actual products. Both of these produced almost 
the same result, verifying the utility of mold flow analysis.  
 
Shuhua.Yue et al. [14] successfully applied a CAD/CAE/CAM 
integrated system to the design and manufacture of die-casts. Time 
required for design and manufacture were shortened as a result. CAE 
simulation predicted the flow status of die-casts, contributing to the 
production of high quality die cast parts and less time required for 
design. 
 
This study used Flow-3D software as a mold flow simulation and 
analysis tool. Many gate and running systems were designed.  
Different results after mold flow analysis were discussed with the aim 
of identifying an optimal flow system. The simulations were compared 
with actual products, verifying the practicability of mold flow analysis 
and the importance of gate and running systems. 
 
2  BASIC THEORM OF DIE CASTING 
 
The mold flow analysis was based on fluid mechanics, heat transfer, 
solidifying theorem and applied mechanics [15]. The numerical 
analysis method was applied to illustrate some of the physical 
phenomenon of die-casting. The basic theorem was built on three 
equations of fluid mechanics as follows:

3 FEM SIMULATION ANALYSIS 
 
Besides process parameters, the most important in the mold design 
project was flowing system design, the overall system contained the 
gate, the runner, slug well and the air exhaust passage. In order to 
enhance the die casting production quality, it strictly required that 
turbulence and air did not exist in the molten metal in the filling 
process. Many domestic and foreign literatures confirmed that flowing 
system had considerable effect upon the casting quality. A set of die 
casting mold costs more than thousands, if it needs continuous try and 
repair to complete mold design and manufacturing in the development 
process, it will spend huge expense and achieve low efficiency. 
Therefore, the die casting mold nowadays have to carry out flow 
analysis before production, it was the basic principle and the essential 
process. Strictly keep from molten metal 
 
To obtain fine quality and few pores of die casting parts, the principal 
requirement was for the molten metal to flow steadily into the cavity. 
A plunger pushed molten metal into the cavity, while gate and runner 
shapes were estimated to avoid turbulence. According to many authors 
in the field of mold flow experimental models, errors exist between 
theorem and practice. The actual situation was so complicated,

According to variables of gates to discuss the following problem: 
(1) The changes of gate width to explore the flow effect of molten 
metal in the cavity. 
(2) The injection along the side of each part trapped air at the top and 
bottom side of each part. Changing gate position allowed 
inspection of the air trap situation. 
(3) The original purpose of three gates injection was to increase flow 
in the middle of each part, but the middle of each part is precise 
and the size difference is so small. Thus, the flow is slow. 
(4) The purpose of variable thicknesses of gates was to observe the 
flowing ability in the middle of each part, because the flow is 
slow in the middle of each part. 
 
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSES 
 
4.1  Analytic results 
 
(1) Cases 1 through 7 were used to investigate the influence of width 
of gate on molding. Gate width was from 20 to 62.5 mm. Increasing 
gate width was found to improve air trap conditions, improve flow 
smoothness, and reduce product defects. Case 7 was found to 
represent optimal gate design. 
 
In Fig. 3, the results from the finite difference method (FDM) showed 
that molten metal could not fill the cavity completely in the required 
time resulting in short shot when the gate width was 20 mm. Gate 
width of 30 mm also caused short shot, but flow condition was 
improved as shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 5, the filling process was 
completed when gate width was 40 mm, but the size of the runner was 
small which caused air to be trapped at both the top and bottom of 
each part. Fig 6 showed molten metal had a steady flow in the cavity 
and the filling was completed when gate width was 62.5 mm. In this 
case the air trap could not occur.

5 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The die casting process was complicated and difficult to analyse. The 
mold analysis software was so expensive that mold factories could not 
afford to use it to estimate and analyse the running system. Instead, 
conventional designers typically rely on experience to determine 
optimal gate and runner systems. The method of trial and error, 
however, was inefficient in both time and materials. It is easy to 
reduce mold strength and shorten the service life of mold during the 
repair.  It is useful to enhance the abilities of mold design and 
optimize the processing parameters by using computer-aided mold 
flow analysis and accumulating practical experience. The mold flow 
analysis was very helpful to increase yield rate of die casting parts and 
shorten development time. 
 
This study applied Flow 3D mold flow analysis software to improve 
the design of a running system for a zinc alloy die casting mold. The 
results could help to prevent product defects, improve product quality, 
and save development time and cost. The following conclusions can 
be drawn based on the analytic results in this study: 
 
(1) Gate size depends on gate width. Increasing gate width can 
improve air trap conditions, enhance flow stability and reduce product 
defects.  
(2) A single gate can inject molten metal simultaneously into a cavity 
according to product geometry. This effectively avoids production of 
an air trap. 
(3) Gate position should be along the shortest distance of a product so 
as to increase flow capability. 
(4) Variable gate thickness does not change flow characteristics but 
increases manufacturing difficulty. 
(5) Comparison of actual die casting of part as part of a simulation 
showed that the actual die casting of part was very close to mold 
analysis simulation.

ABSTRACT 
 
This study aimed to create a multi-cavity die casting mould for thin shell zinc alloy parts of maximum 1.6mm 
thickness. The die casting processes involved a hot-chamber die casting experiment and computer aided simulation to 
explore the flowing condition of the molten metal in the metal molding process. Computer-aided mould flow analysis 
software FLOW 3D V9.2 was applied to simulate the filling stage of zinc alloy in the mould cavities. The design 
parameters of the mould included four variables relating to the gate: width, position, shape, and thickness of cross-
section. 
 
The simulated flow into the middle of the mould was found to be relatively slow but was faster on the two sides. The 
flow slowed down when it met obstructions and in some cases thicker place in the filling stage. The flow on the both 
sides of the cavity would gradually surround the center so that an air trap was produced. Analysis results shows that 
the primary goals of runner design include two things: (1) the flow path of molten metal was shortest; (2) the mould 
cavity was easiest to fill with molten metal. The runner design used analysis software to simulate the flowing 
condition of the air, which produced an air trap. The melting metal motive force pushed air into the slug well in order 
to reduce the production of pores. The experiment confirms the actual flowing situation of zinc alloy with a nearly 
95% accuracy.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The die casting parts were solidified at high pressure with rapid 
cooling. Their grain sizes were so small (about 0.013mm) that the 
tensile strength of die casting parts were better than other casting parts. 
The die casting mold was made by high quality heat-resistant steel. 
The steel was characterized by long service life and high cooling 
speed, features that can save casting time. The residual stock of 
casting parts was small, saving materials and processing cost. Die 
casting was the most efficient and economic casting method. It can 
make simple and complicated products widely used in furniture and 
bathroom accessories, neck tie clips, automobile and electric parts. 
 
Currently die-cast production requires mold flow analysis. Mold flow 
analysis can predict the flow condition of molten metal in the running 
system, hence correcting defects prior to production. The method can 
reduce development time and cost, and increase the mold design 
efficiency and parts quality [1]-[6]. 
 
W.B. Lee et al. [7] discussed the wall thickness of die casting parts, 
where different gate designs were adopted to detect the influence of 
molten metal flow in die casting parts. The results indicate that casting 
parts easily produced pores in larger thicknesses. Changing the air 
exhaust passage meant that the thick casting parts still had turbulence.  
When thicker walls in the casting parts were near the gate, turbulences 
and pores were both relatively hard to produce. 
 
Sulaiman and Tham Chee Keen [8] studied gate and runner system 
design and manufacture. They applied minimum divergence angle to 
obtain minimum energy consumption. The minimum divergence angle 
can reduce the resistance of molten metal as it goes into a cavity. 
 
Joseph HA et al. [9] used CAE software to simulate and analyse a gate 
and running system. Comparison between simulation and actual 
products revealed both produced similar results, indicating the value 
of gate and running system design. 
 
Winston Sequeira et al. [10] applied CAE software to design and 
obtain optimal parameters. The study reduced waste material, 
improved die casting machine performance, and shortened 
development time. Best results were achieved where the slug well was 
placed in the final filling position and mold release agents, airs and

casting parts; it became waste material after die casting process. 
Shorter length of runner helped to reduce the recycling of the waste 
material, increase production efficiency and lower manufacturing cost. 
 
The gate was a inlet to the cavity for molten metal. A smaller gate 
could speed up filling process, and spray molten metal into the cavity. 
A suitable gate position making molten metal flowed steadily in the 
cavity to reduce the possibility of the backflow phenomenon and melt 
line of parts. The key points in the gate design of die casting molds 
were: (1) mold had enough space to exhaust air; (2) molten metal 
flowed steadily in the cavity and; (3) the gate was positioned at the 
longest side of casting parts [16]. 
 
This study used FLOW-3D software to analyze flow condition. 
Assumptions of mold flow analysis were: (1) molten alloy is a liquid; 
(2) molten alloy is an incompressible fluid; (3) molten alloy is a 
Newtonian fluid; (4) fluid is turbulence; (5) only heat transfer between 
fluid and mold wall is calculated; and (6) only molten alloy exists in 
the cavity, hence the effect of air is negated. 
 
Casting parts with one mold and two cavities of non-uniform shell 
thickness were designed for the experiment. Figure 1 shows 3D CAD 
model and sizes. Figure 2 shows maximum thickness of the parts is 
1.6 mm and minimum thickness is 0.2 mm. The parameters used in the 
finite difference method (FDM) are listed in Table 1. The main design 
parameters were gate width, gate shape, gate position and gate 
thickness. Table 2 illustrates 11 cases that are a combination of 
different parameters. These cases were explained as follows: 
(1) Table 3 shows the variable width of gate, from 20 to 62.5 mm. 
(2) Table 4 shows the shapes of gates divided into a single gate and 
three gates. 
(3) In order to allow injections, gate positions were divided along the 
long side of each part and along the short side of each part (see 
Table 5). 
(4) Gate thicknesses (see Table 6) were of uniform 0.4 mm thickness 
and also two non-uniform thicknesses of 0.4mm/0.2mm/0.4mm 
and 0.2mm/0.4mm/0.2mm

Gate shapes were divided into a single gate and three-gate 
combination. In Fig. 6, it is clear that a single gate could let molten 
metal flow forward smoothly along the mold. In Fig. 7, the design of 
the three-gate configuration sped up the flow in the middle of the mold. 
Gate geometry obstructed the flow, however, which caused molten 
metal to fill around the cavity, producing a serious air trap.

to stop metal flow, the cause included the geometry of product was 
complicated, thin product and size difference was so small. Gate 
position, therefore, should be placed along the longest side of any part.

variable which did not affect the flow in the middle of the part. The 
variable cross section of a gate could obstruct the flow of metal, 
producing few pores and increasing post-processing difficulties.

and simulations 
 
The differences between actual die casting of parts and simulations 
were discussed as follows: 
 
(1) Case 7 provided the fundamental basis of comparison. Table 7 
listed a comparison between CAE simulations and die casting 
experiment with flow rate of 40%, 80% and 100% respectively. The 
error rate of about 5-10% was verified by amplifying the shape of 
parts.
