INTRODUCTION 
Aromatic polyimides are highly heat-resistant materials and have been widely used 
in many applications such as microelectronics, coatings, composite materials, and 
membranes.1 However, their applicability has been limited because aromatic 
polyimides are normally insoluble and infusible in the fully imidized form because of 
their rigid-chain characteristics, leading to processing difficulties. Thus, polyimide 
processing is generally carried out with a poly(amic acid) intermediate and then is 
converted to a polyimide via rigorous thermal treatment. Problems often arise because 
the poly(amic acid)s are thermally and hydrolytically unstable. The water evolved 
during imidization also tends to cause voids in the final materials.2 To overcome these 
problems, much research effort has been focused on designing and synthesizing new 
dianhydrides3~8 and diamines9~15 that resulted in soluble and processable polyimides 
in the fully imidized form without deterioration of their positive properties. One of the 
effective approaches in improving the solubility of aromatic polyimides is the 
incorporation of a crank and twisted non-coplanar structure or hydroxyl groups into 
the polymer main chain.16~17 
The hydroxyl groups on the backbones of the imidized polyimides were important 
to ensure the solubility and the reactive sites with functional chromophore 
molecules18. They were reported to be interesting for membranes, photosensitive 
polyimides19-20 or for nonlinear optic application. As the continuation to the study, we 
have designed newly hydroxyl groups-containing poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s. The 
present work deals with the synthesis and basic characterization of new aromatic 
poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s containing the hydroxyl group by the polymerization of 
2,3-bis(4-amino-3-hydroxyphenoxy)naphthalene with aromatic tetracarboxylic 
dianhydrides through one-step method.

In a 500-mL round-bottom flask equipped with a stirring bar, 18.4395g (0.03mol) 
of compound 3 and 0.75g of 10% Pd/C were dissolved/suspended in 240mL of 
ethanol. The suspension solution was heated to reflux, and 10.5mL of hydrazine 
monohydrate was added slowly to the mixture, then the solution was stirred at reflux 
temperature. After a further 9h of reflux, the solution was filtered hot to remove Pd/C. 
and then 200mL water was added to the solution. The crude product was purified by 
recrystallization from ethanol/water then cooled to precipitate orange-red crystals. 
The product was collected by filtration and washed with ethanol, and dried in vacuo at

homogeneous solution was poured into a 9-cm glass Petri dish, which was placed in a 
90℃ oven overnight for the slow release of the solvent, and then the film was stripped 
off from the glass substrate and further dried in vacuo at 180℃ for 8 h. The obtained 
films were about 60~90μm thick and were used for X-ray diffraction measurements, 
tensile tests, solubility tests, and thermal analyses. 
 
Measurements 
  Infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer RXI FT-IR spectrometer. 
Elemental analyses were run in Elementar VarioEL-III. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were 
measured on a Varian Unity Inova 600 FT-NMR system. The inherent viscosities were 
determined at 0.5g/dL concentration using Tamson TV-2000 viscometer at 30 . ℃
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were performed at room 
temperature (ca. 25 ) on a Shimadzu℃  XRD-7000 X-ray diffractometer (40kV, 20mA), 
using graphite-monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation. An Instron universal tester model 
4400R with a load cell 5kg was used to study the stress-strain behavior of the samples. 
A gauge length of 2cm and a crosshead speed of 5mm/min were used for this study. 
Measurements were performed at room temperature with film specimens (0.5cm 
width, 6cm length), and an average of at least three replicates was used. 
Thermogravimentric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA. 
Experiments were carried out on approximately 6~8mg film samples heated in 
flowing nitrogen or air (flow rate = 20cm3/min) at a heating rate of 20 /min℃ . DSC 
analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond DSC at a scan rate of 
20℃/min in flowing nitrogen (20cm3 /min). Thermomechanical analysis (TMA) was 
conducted with a PerkinElmer TMA 7 instrument. The TMA experiments were 
conducted from 50 to 350℃ at a scan rate of 10℃/min with a penetration probe

Polymer Synthesis 
  The one-step procedure starting from aromatic hydroxyl diamines and 
tetracarboxylic dianhydrides in the presence of isoquinoline as a catalyst, as well as 
conventional two-step process, involving a ring-opening addition and subsequent 
thermal cyclodehydration, are convenient methods for the preparation of 
polyimides.22 A series of novel poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s PHIa~PHIf were synthesized 
by the one-step method starting from hydroxyl diamine monomer 3 with aromatic 
tetracarboxylic dianhydrides a~f in the presence of a catalytic amount of isoquinoline 
at 200℃. Structures and codes of the polymers obtained are shown in Scheme 1.2. 
Unfortunately, however, the syntheses of poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s by two-step method 
via chemical imidization were not suitable. For the chemical-imidization process, the 
hydroxyl groups on the polymer backbone react with acetic anhydride which were add 
to the polyamic acid solution. The formation of poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s was 
confirmed with elemental analysis, IR, and NMR spectroscopy. The results of 
elemental analysis are summarized in Table 1.1. Figure 1.4 shows a typical IR 
spectrum for poly(o-hydroxy-imide) PHIe. These polymers exhibited board 
absorption bands in the region of 2500 to 3500cm-1 (O-H stretch) and characteristic 
imide absorption bands at 1775 (asymetrical C＝O), 1719 (symmetrical C＝O), 1396 
(C－N), and 743 cm-1 (imide ring deformation). Figure 1.5 shows a typical set of 1H 
and 13C NMR spectra of poly(o-hydroxy-imide) PHId in DMSO-d6, where all the 
peaks have been readily assigned to the hydrogen and carbon atoms of the recurring 
unit.

Polymer Properties 
Tensile and Film Properties 
The color of polyimide films depends markedly on the chemical structure of 
dianhydride components. Thus, the color of poly(o-hydroxy-imide) PHIa~PHIf films 
were from brown to yellowish. The pale brown color of the films can be attributed to 
charge-transfer complexing between the electron-donating amino or hydroxyl unit and 
the strongly electron-accepting pyromellitimide or phthalimide unit. As mentioned 
previously, the poly(o-hydroxy-imide) PHIa~PHIf could afford flexible, transparent, 
and tough films. These films were subjected to tensile testing, and the results are 
given in Table 1.2. The tensile strengths, elongations to break, and initial modulus of 
these films were in the ranges of 55.17~110.19MPa, 2.69~10.37% and 2.25–2.90GPa, 
respectively. The polymer films were measured for optical transparency using UV-vis 
spectroscopy. Figure 1.6 depicts the UV-vis transmittance spectra of the 
poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s films and the cutoff wavelengths in the range of 407~560nm. 
 
X-ray diffraction data 
From the diffraction patterns shown in Figure 1.7, the X-ray diffraction studies of 
the poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s indicated that all the polymers were essentially 
amorphous. They failed to exhibit any crystallinity apparently because of the 
noncoplanar structure. The amorphous nature of these polymers was also reflected in 
their excellent solubility.

from pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) only dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 
dimethylacetamide, all the other poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s showed good solubility in 
other organic solvents. Poly(o-hydroxy-imide) PHIa with symmetric pyromellitimide 
units also showed fairly good solubility. This may be due to the amorphous nature of 
these polymers and the hydroxyl groups on the polymer main chain. 
 
3.3.4 Thermal Properties 
Thermal properties of these poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s are summarized in Table 1.4. 
Typical TGA curves for poly(o-hydroxy-imide) PHIf are reproduced in Figrue 1.8. 
The 10% weight-loss temperatures of the poly(o-hydroxy-imide)s in nitrogen and air 
were recorded in the range of 413~519℃ and 403~460℃, respectively. The amount 
of carbonized residue (char yield) of these polymers in nitrogen atmosphere was more 
than 52% at 800℃. The high char yields of these polymers can be ascribed to their 
high aromatic content. The glass-transition temperatures (Tg’s) of all the polymers 
expect for PHIa were observed in the range of 275~320℃ by DSC and decreased 
with decreasing rigidity and symmetry of the aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydride 
used. All the polymers indicated no clear melting endotherms up to the decomposition 
temperatures on the DSC thermograms. The softening temperatures (Ts) (may be 
referred as apparent Tg) of the polymer film samples were determined by the TMA 
method with a loaded penetration probe. They were obtained from the onset 
temperature of the probe displacement on the TMA trace. A typical TMA thermogram 
for poly(o-hydroxy-imide) PHIf is illustrated in Figure 1.9. In all cases, the Ts values 
obtained by TMA are comparable to the Tg values measured by the DSC experiments 
(Table 1.4). There is a large window between Tg or Ts and the decomposition 
temperature of each polymer, which could be advantageous in the processing of these 
polymers by the thermoforming technique.
