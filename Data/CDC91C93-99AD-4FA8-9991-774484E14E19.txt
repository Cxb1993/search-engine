In the present study, SC will be conducted to
purify ST from the binary mixtures (ST/EB) and
the multi-component mixtures (ST/EB/PX/
MX/OX), respectively.
2.Principle of the SC process
The basic principles of the SC process can be
explained by referring to the phase diagrams.
Figure 1 illustrates the phase diagram of ST and
EB at normal pressure (P=0.1 MPa). Note that
the ST/EB liquid mixture exhibits the nonideal
solution behavior. The eutectic point lies at
T=-99.9℃ and XW,ST=0.159. The solid-liquid
equilibrium (SLE) based on the ideal liquid
solution is also plotted for comparison.
As pressure is reduced, the SLE is assumed
to remain almost the same while the vapor -liquid
equilibrium (VLE) will be moved downward.
For example, Figure 2 illustrates the low
pressure phase diagram of ST and EB at
P=0.133 Pa. It shows the existence of two
three-phase states. One is a three-phase state
having pure ST-solid, and liquid phase and vapor
phase of mixtures at T=-72.4 ℃  on the
right-hand side of Figure 2.
3.SC simulation process
    The SC process is simulated in a series of N
equilibrium stage operation shown in Figure 3.
Each stage is operated under an adiabatic
condition at a three-phase equilibrium.
    The temperature of each stage is chosen to
meet Tn-1 –Tn=ΔT for n=1,2,….,N . The vapor
formed in each stage is condensed to
the liquid and removed while the solid and the
liquid formed in each stage enter the next stage.
The whole process starts from the liquid feed
and continues until the liquid phase is
completely eliminated.
    The total material balance in stage n can be
described by
nnnnn VLSLS   11              (1)
It is noted that in each stage solid phase
comprises only pure solid of component -1 while
liquid phase and vapor phase consists of t he
mixture containing j components. Thus, the
material balance of component -i in stage n can
be described by
jiYVXLXL ninninnin ~2for)()()( 11  (2)
As each stage is operated under an adiabatic
condition, the latent heat released in forming
component-1 crystals is removed by vaporizing
portions of the liquid mixture. Thus, the energy
balance in stage n can be described by
nVnnLnnSnnLnnSn HVHLHSHLHS )()()()()( 1111   (3)
The solid-liquid equilibrium of component -1 in
stage n can be described by (Prausnitz et al.

6.Conclusions
A model has been derived to simulate the
actual SC operation. The simulations can provide
essential information in operation of the actual
SC process. SC is applied successfully to purify
ST from the binary ST/EB mixture and the
multi-component ST/EB/PX/MX/OX mixtures.
