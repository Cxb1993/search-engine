英文摘要 
This report includes five parts of research results of the project. The first part is that 
we have separately used two blue-emitting polyspirofluorenes, 
spirodiethylhexyloxylpolyfluorene (spiro-diEHPF) and triphenylamine-grafted 
spirodiethylhexyloxylpolyfluorene (spiro-TPA50-diEHPF) as hosts, which exhibit 
rather high charge mobilities in the order of 10−3 –10−4 cm2 /V s, to blend with a 
yellow-emitting fluorescent dye, rubrene. The white polymer light-emitting diode 
(WPLED) with rubrene (0.35 wt%)-doped spiro-diEHPF shows a maximal brightness 
of 36000 cd/m2 with a maximal efficiencie 3.5 cd/A, and its Commission 
Internationale de I’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates is (0.336, 0.362), very close to (0.33, 
0.33) of the pure white emission. In addition, for rubrene (0.35 wt%)-doped 
triphenylamine-grafted polymer, spiro-TPA50-diEHPF, the maximal brightness and 
current efficiency are 56000 cd/m2 and 9 cd/A for the white-emitting device. In 
addition to the achievement of the highest white brightness (56000 cd/m2) ever 
reported, the electroluminescence (EL) profiles of the investigated devices show 
nearly independent of the applied voltages. 
After that, we find that a high-performance WPLED can be achieved via blending 
poly[9,9-Bis(N-carbazolyldecyl)fluorene-co-9,9-di-n-octylfluorene] (3/1) (Cz75PF) 
with only 0.25 wt% poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] 
(MEHPPV). Upon this blending ratio, a maximum current efficiency of 4.1 cd/A (2.48 
lm/W, external quantum efficiency of 1.63 %) at 1,921 cd/m2 (5.2 V) with CIE 
coordinates (0.336, 0.362) and a maximum brightness of 32,471 cd/m2 at 8 V is 
acquired. Such a high device performance are mainly attributed to the intense charge 
trapping in MEHPPV as evidenced by the decrease of current density with the 
presence of MEHPPV in Cz75PF and the results of time-resolved 
electroluminescence (TREL) measurements. 
  Next, we demonstrate that a high-performance WPLEDs based on a single emission 
layer with injection barrier-free interface can be achieved using a blend of the 
poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) and MEHPPV as the dopant, 
the amipolar Cz75PF as the host, and the CFx and CsF/Ca as the anode and cathode, 
respectively. We show that the device, ITO/CFx/Cz75PF+0.26 wt% F8BT+0.52 wt% 
MEHPPV/CsF/Ca/Al, achieves excellent performance with maximum current 
efficiency 8.6 cd/A, maximum brightness, 35 000 cd/m2, and CIE coordinates of (0.32, 
0.34). These coordinates are very close to the CIE coordinates for pure white light, 
(0.33, 0.33), and result from a superior balance between hole and electron fluxes and a 
proper dopant to host ratio. This white-light-emitting PLED is single layer device

box with inert atmosphere and then baked at 50  under ℃ vacuum for 1 day. And an 
aluminum layer of 100 nm was then deposited in 10-6 Torr over the polymer layer 
through a shadow mask. The photocurrent was generated by a nitrogen-laser-pumped 
dye laser at 390 nm (near the absorptions maxima of the polymers) with a pulse width 
of 500 ps through ITO electrode. A transient current was measured across the load 
resistor using a 500 MHz digital oscilloscope. The carrier mobility μ is calculated 
from transient time tT by the relation μ=d/EtT, where d is film thickness and E is 
external electric field. 
For preparation of light-emitting devices, a 30 nm thick PEDOT:PSS (Bayer 
Baytron P) layer was coated on top of the pre-treated ITO. After drying for 1h at 140 
 in vacuum, the emitting polymer ℃ of 80 nm thickness was spin-coated over 
PEDOT:PSS from its solution (8mg/mL in toluene). Finally, a CsF(1.5 nm)/Ca(1.5 
nm) composite electron injection layer covered by Al electrode (80 nm) were 
deposited successively at ca. 10-6 Torr. All the processes were carried out in a glove 
box with argon (oxygen and moisture content less than 1 ppm), except those for ITO 
cleaning and PEDOT:PSS coating. Device performances were characterized by 
Keithley 238 source measure unit for currents versus applied voltage and Topcon 
BM-8 luminance meter for luminance. 
1-1-3 Results and Discussion 
From the time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, the photocurrent transients of 
spiro-diEHPF and spiro-TPA50-diEHPF (both the hole and electron currents) exhibit 
dispersive transport characteristic. From the method of integrating photocurrents for 
dispersive photocurrent profile,7 the effective charge carrier mobility (μ) can be 
calculated as: μh ~2.8x10-3 cm2/Vs and μe ~3.4x10-3 cm2/Vs for spiro-diEHPF, and μh 
~1.25x10-4 cm2/Vs and μe ~1.24x10-3 cm2/Vs for spiro-TPA50-diEHPF. Both 
polymers are ambipolar and exhibit comparable charge carrier transport capability. 
The charge carrier mobilities are considerable high among conjugated polymers and 
are comparable to their small-molecule counterparts (i.e. Ter(9,9-diarylfluorene)s with 
μh ~4x10-4 cm2/Vs and μe ~1.2x10-3 cm2/Vs).8 Like most conjugated polymers without 
heteroatoms, spiro-diEHPF shows preferentially p-type conducting properties. Figure 
2 represents the characteristics of single carrier devices for these two investigated 
polymers. The current density of spiro-TPA50-diEHPF (ca. 7.7x10-4 A/cm2 at 5x105 
V/cm) is larger than that of spiro-diEHPF  (ca. 7.4x10-5 A/cm2 at 5x105 V/cm) in the 
hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Au) by 1~ 2 order, revealing a 
facilitated hole injection of spiro-TPA50-diEHPF devices due to the incorporation of 
TPA on side groups.

time (from several µs to 10-3µs) for the rubrene doped spiro-diEHPF than that of the 
pristine spiro-deEHPF from the TOF measurement. Obviously, rubrene is a trapping 
site for holes in spiro-diEHPF. However, there is almost no difference between the 
HOMO positions of TPA and rubrene. Therefore, TPA groups can function as a 
leakage channel for holes that get trapped in rubrene, through which holes and thus 
the recombination centers can possibly move out of rubrene at higher applied 
voltages. 
Figure 4 reveals the characteristics of (a) white and (b) yellow-emitting devices for 
rubrene-doped spiro-diEHPF and spiro-TPA50-diEHPF. Due to the presence of TPA 
groups, hole injection is more facilitated in spiro-TPA50-diEHPF so that it shows 
better device performance than spiro-diEHPF. The white-emitting devices of the 
doped spiro-diEHPF and spiro-TPA50-diEHPF exhibit maximal luminous efficiency 
of 3.5 and 9 Cd/A, and maximal luminance of 36,000 and 56,000 Cd/m2, respectively. 
The present device (spiro-TPA50-diEHPF doped 0.35 wt% rubrene) luminance is the 
highest one among white-emitting PLEDs in the literature.10 Moreover, the nearly 
bias-independent electroluminance in the present devices revealing their high 
potentiality to practical use. It is also worth emphasizing that the rubrene-doped 
spiro-polyfluorenes reported here requires no additional blocking layer so that the 
operating voltage is much lower than the phosphorescent complex-doped PLED.10 For 
the yellow-emitting devices, the maximal luminous efficiency is 10 and 14 Cd/A for 
the doped spiro-diEHPF and spiro-TPA50-diEHPF, respectively. And both 
demonstrate a very high achievable luminance of ca. 70,000 Cd/m2. 
In conclusion, we have used the two ambipolar spiro-polyfluorenes, spiro-diEHPF 
and spiro-TPA50-diEHPF. Both show rather high electron and hole mobility of the 
order of 10-3~10-4 cm2/Vs so that they can serve as quite good host for doping. 
White-emitting devices with the highest luminance (56,000 Cd/m2) ever reported has 
been achieved by doping the polymers with rubrene. Excellent color stability at 
different applied voltages is observed in the rubrene-doped spiro-diEHPF devices, due 
to the trapping effect of rubrene on holes. On the other hand, the TPA groups of 
spiro-TPA50-diEHPF and rubrene have comparable HOMO levels. Hence, for the 
rubrene-doped spiro-TPA50-diEHPF devices, holes and recombination sites can move 
out of the dopant at high applied voltages, making EL spectra slightly 
voltage-dependent.

1-2. Two-Component Blend for High-Performance White Polymer 
Light-Emitting Diode 
1-2-1. Preface, literature analysis, and research aim 
Recently, the innovation of white polymer light-emitting diode (WPLED) has been 
becoming an important issue due to the need for solid-state lighting sources and 
back-lighting for liquid-crystal displays.1-3 Main strategies for the realization of 
WPLED with high device performance focused on (1) blending a host conjugated 
polymer with fluorescent dyes,4,5 phosphorescent molecules,6-8 or another conjugated 
polymer,1,9-11 and (2) building a single-polymer architecture with the simultaneous 
emissions of red, green, and blue lights.3,12,13 Blending basically suffers from the 
phase separation of the component materials (especially for organic molecules with 
small molecular weight owing to their low glass-transition temperatures), but this 
method is relatively simple for the acquirement of a WPLED with low-cost 
fabrication due to the prevention of time-consuming and elaborate synthetic works. 
Tasch et al.1 firstly used a homogeneous blend of two conjugated polymers (a blue 
light-emitting laddertype poly(paraphenylene) (m-LPPP) with 0.05 wt% red-emission 
poly(perylene-co-diethynylbenzene) (PPDB)) as the active emitting layer for WPLED 
and obtained a maximum quantum efficiency of 0.8 %. Ho et al.9 reported that a 
WPLED based on blend of two model conjugated polymers, which were 
poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl) (PFO) as host and poly[2-methoxy-5-(2’- 
ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEHPPV) as guest (blending weight ratio 
was 60:1), exhibited electroluminescence (EL) CIE coordinates (0.34, 0.35) at 10 V 
but with a relatively low device performance (maximum efficiency and brightness 
were 0.6 cd/A and 1,700 cd/m2, respectively). Another polymer blend consisting of 
polyfluorene grafted with oxadiazole and triphenylamine as side chains (PFTO) and 
its copolymer with 5 mol% benzoselenadiazole (PFTO-BSeD5) (9 wt%) as emitting 
layer which can reach a maximum efficiency and brightness of 4.08 cd/A (1.64 % and 
1.15 lm/W at about 100 cd/m2) and 7,328 cd/m2 (21 V), respectively, with stable CIE 
coordinates from (0.32, 0.33) at 6 V to (0.31, 0.33) at 21 V was reported by Shih et 
al.10 Yang and co-workers11 have further enhanced the device performance of PFO 
blended with MEHPPV (0.5 wt%) to a maximum power efficiency of 16 lm/W and a 
CIE (0.36, 0.4) by the insertion of a hole-blocking and electron-injection layer 
(cesium carbonate) between emitting layer and aluminum cathode. 
  Obviously, the simultaneous fulfillment of high device efficiency and pure white 
emission at high brightness necessary for WPLED has not been accomplished through 
the polymer-blend strategy. In this letter, we adopt a two-component blend system 
consisting of poly[9,9-Bis(N-carbazolyldecyl)fluorene-co-9,9-di-n-octylfluorene]

1-2-3. Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 shows the PL spectra of Cz75PF/MEHPPV(0.25 wt%) film. Apparently, 
except the presence of two emission peaks at 424 and 440 nm belonging to the 
monomeric emissions (0-0 and 0-1 bands, respectively) of Cz75PF (see PL spectrum 
of Cz75PF film in Fig. 1), a characteristic MEHPPV emission at 570 nm with a 
shoulder at 620 nm as referred to PL spectrum of MEHPPV solution (its relatively 
blue-shifted peaks positioned at 557 and 600 nm are due to the smaller MEHPPV 
concentration (0.001 mg/mL approximately equals to 0.0001 wt%) than as compared 
to 0.25 wt% in the polymer blend) also appears. The simultaneous existence of host 
and guest emissions means the occurrence of incomplete energy transfer from 
Cz75PF to MEHPPV because of the partial spectral overlap of PL spectrum of 
Cz75PF and UV spectrum of MEHPPV (Fig. 1). 
Figure 2 illustrates current density-applied voltage-brightness curves of 
Cz75PF/MEHPPV(0.25 wt%) with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT/polymer 
blend/CsF/Ca/Al. The inset (a) shows its corresponding current efficiency versus 
applied voltages. Light turn-on voltage (at the measurable brightness of 2 cd/m2), 
maximum brightness and current efficiency are 3.1 V, 32,471 cd/m2 (8 V), and 4.1 
cd/A (at 5.2 V and 1,921 cd/m2, corresponds to 2.48 lm/W and an external quantum 
efficiency of 1.63%), respectively. On the other hand, inset (b) exhibits the variations 
of EL spectra with various applied voltages. The intensities of two peaks at 424 and 
440 nm (monomeric emissions of Cz75PF as mentioned above) and a shoulder around 
510 nm resulting from the electroplex emission formed by the stacking of 
carbazole-carbazole excimer and main-chain fluorene15 increase with applied voltage 
and become relatively unchanged under the higher voltages (5 and 6 V). In addition, 
the characteristic MEHPPV monomeric emissions at 570 and 617 nm appear in these 
EL spectra. Obviously, this low blending-concentration (0.25 wt%) resulting in the 
dominant MEHPPV emission intensity (especially for the lower voltages at 3 and 4 V) 
means that charge trapping performs a much more important role than energy transfer 
in EL behaviors as evidenced by the fact that, in comparison with the PL (Fig. 1) and 
EL spectra of Cz75PF/MEHPPV(0.25 wt%), the PL intensity ratios (570 nm to 422 
nm) are only about 3.1 and 22 % of EL intensity ratios (570 nm to 426 nm) at 3 and 6 
V, respectively. However, such a high current efficiency (4.1 cd/A) accompanying a 
white emission whose CIE coordinates (0.336, 0.362) are close to (0.33, 0.33) of pure 
white light and a brightness (1,921 cd/m2) should contribute from charge trapping due 
to its effective recombination of hoe and electron.19 On the other hand, we must 
emphasize that this blending concentration (0.25 wt%) is an optimum value for white 
emission because the higher doping concentration (0.5 wt%) of MEHPPV in Cz75PF 
causes a pale yellow EL emission, CIE coordinates (0.393, 0.403) at 6 V.

aggregates (serve as trap sites) than in isolated MEHPPV chains after the turn-off of 
electric-field excitation in TREL measurements.18 
In conclusion, binary-component blend of a guest MEHPPV with its HOMO and 
LUMO levels locating between those of the host Cz75PF possesses the severe 
charge-trapping tendency. The occurrence of charge trapping can be clearly disclosed 
by the results of TREL measurements and results in a white emission (CIE indices are 
x = 0.336 and y = 0.362) with a current efficiency of 4.1 cd/A (2.48 lm/W and 1.63%) 
at 5.2 V and 1,921 cd/m2 for Cz75PF being lightly blended with 0.25 wt% MEHPPV. 
The maximum brightness of 32,471 cd/m2 (8 V) demonstrates the potential of this 
simple method on PLED lighting application.

1-3. High-performance white polymer light-emitting diodes based on a 
single emission layer with injection barrier-free interfaces 
1-3-1. Preface, literature analysis, and research aim 
Organic and polymeric light-emitting diodes (OLEDs and PLEDs) have drawn 
great attention in recent years because of their scientific significance and commercial 
potential.[1,2] Among their versatile applications, white organic/polymeric 
light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs or WPLEDs) are potentially applicable to in 
active-matrix displays and might eventually be used in solid-state lighting.[3,4] A 
number of studies have reported structural concepts for devices that achieve a white 
emission, including the mixing of the three primary (red, green, and blue) colors from 
respective layers in a multilayer structure,[5-6] the doping of appropriate quantities of 
red, green, and blue dopants in the same host,[7] and the use of excimer or exciplex 
formation,[8,9] etc. In terms of material design for single layer WOLEDs or WPLEDs, 
there are main three methods of achieving white-light EL emission; these include 
single copolymers,[10] polymer/polymer blends,[6,11] and small molecule/polymer 
blends[12]. Single copolymers are specifically designed to incorporate moieties that 
yield particular functions for efficient white light emission, but this corresponds to 
high material costs. By comparison, blended systems are advantageous because they 
can be fabricated by solution process at room temperature. However, these systems 
have difficulty simultaneously producing pure white light (CIEx,y (0.33, 0.33)) and 
high device performance due to imbalances between the three primary colors (red, 
green, blue) and between hole and electron fluxes. This study demonstrates that a 
high-performance WPLEDs based on a single emission layer with injection 
barrier-free interface can be achieved using a blend of the 
poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) and 
poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) as the 
dopant, the amipolar poly(9,9-bis(N-carbazole-decyl)-fluorene) (Cz75PF) as the host, 
and the CFx and CsF/Ca as the anode and cathode, respectively. We show that the 
device, ITO/CFx/Cz75PF+0.26 wt% F8BT+0.52 wt% MEH-PPV/CsF/Ca/Al, 
achieves excellent performance with maximum current efficiency 8.6 cd/A, maximum 
brightness, 35 000 cd/m2, and CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.34). These coordinates are 
very close to the CIE coordinates for pure white light, (0.33, 0.33), and result from a 
superior balance between hole and electron fluxes and a proper dopant to host ratio. 
1-3-2. Experimental Method 
(a) Materials, device fabrication, and general instrumentation. The PFO, 
Cz25PF, Cz50PF, Cz75PF, and Cz100PF we used was synthesized via the Ni[0] 
 16
material.[13,14] This is because a large hole injection barrier (~ 0.6 eV) exists between 
the work function of the commonly used anode PEDOT (~5.2 eV) and the highest 
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the PFO (~5.75 eV).[13] To address this 
problem, this study incorporates carbazole (Cz) groups with four different ratio (0.25, 
0.50, 0.75, and 1.00) on the ends of alkyl side chains of poly(dialkylfluorene) to 
promote hole injection and increase the electron’s transport capability.[15] Figure 1 
shows the chemical structures of these carbazole groups, called Cz25PF, Cz50PF, 
Cz75PF, and Cz100PF. Table I shows the energy gaps and HOMO levels of the PFO 
and the four CzPF series determined by the onset of the UV-vis spectra and the cyclic 
voltammogram (CV) method. The HOMO level of the CzPF series decreases as the 
ratio of the incorporated carbazole moiety increases. This relationship indicates that 
the carbazole moiety can reduce the hole injection barrier between the work function 
of the anode (ITO (5.0 eV) or PEDOT (5.2 eV)) and the HOMO level of the emitting 
polymer. To create a hole injection barrier-free interface, this study uses a CFx hole 
injection layer with an ionization potential value of 5.6 eV to dramatically enhance 
the amount of hole injection.[13] Simultaneously, the composite cathode, CsF/Ca, 
serves as the electrode in the devices to enhance electron injection.[13,16] Table II 
shows the performance of the devices based on the structure, ITO/CFx/PFO or CzPF 
series/CsF/Ca/Al. Results show that the devices with the CzPF series as emitting layer 
perform better than that with the PFO. The ITO/CFx/Cz75PF/CsF/Ca/Al device has 
the best performance of all five devices, with a maximum current efficiency of 7.0 
cd/A and a maximum brightness of 35 000 cd/m2.  
To explain high performace further, we fabricated two kinds of single carrier 
devices, hole-only devices and electron-only devices. Figure 2 shows the I-V 
characteristics of these devices, showing that the CzPF series devices have better 
balances between hole and electron fluxes than that of the PFO device. The hole and 
electron current densities in the CzPF series devices are equal with each other at an 
electric field of 4~5 V, indicating that these devices are amipolar devices and have a 
superior balance between hole and electron fluxes. For hole-only devices, the current 
densities of the CzPF series devices are higher than that of the PFO devices. This is 
because the carbazole (Cz) groups decrease the HOMO levels of the CzPF series, 
leading to smaller hole injection barriers between the work function of the 
CFx-modified ITO and the HOMO levels of the CzPF series (listed in Table I) than 
that between the work function of the CFx-modified ITO and the HOMO level of the 
PFO. Moreover, the hole injection barriers between the work function of the 
CFx-modified ITO (5.6 eV) and the HOMO levels of the Cz50PF(5.59 eV), Cz75PF 
(5.55 eV), or Cz100PF (5.54 eV) devices are negative, indicating barrier-free hole 
injection that allow the hole carriers to inject spontaneously. As for electron-only 
 18
and 0.52 wt% of MEH-PPV. Incomplete energy transfers occurred between the 
Cz75PF and F8BT or MEH-PPV, as shown in the Fig. 4(b), and Cz75PF emissions 
with two intense peaks at 424 and 450 nm exist in all three kinds of blending systems. 
Therefore, the devices with these three blending films can possibly achieve white 
emissions. 
Three devices were fabricated, ITO/CFx(40W)/Cz75PF+0.26 wt% 
F8BT/CsF/Ca/Al, ITO/CFx(40W)/Cz75PF+0.52 wt% MEH-PPV/CsF/Ca/Al, and 
ITO/CFx(40W)/Cz75PF+0.26 wt% F8BT+0.52 wt% MEH-PPV/CsF/Ca/Al, and 
designated as Type I, Type II, and Type III devices, respectively. Table III shows the 
performance of these devices and CIE coordinates closest to pure white light, (0.33, 
0.33). Type I device has very high performance (11.8 cd/A, 70 600 cd/m2), but its CIE 
coordinates (0.36, 0.48) are not very close to pure white light (0.33, 0.33) due to a 
lack in red light emission. Type II device, although its CIE coordinates (0.33,0.36) are 
close to pure white light, has a lower current efficiency (3.5 cd/A), which can be 
explained by the fact that MEH-PPV has a lower quantum efficiency than F8BT.[17,18] 
Type III device has a very high efficiency (8.6 cd/A) with CIE coordinates (0.32, 
0.34), which are very close to pure white light as compared with previous 
reports.[5,6,10-12,19,20] Table IV shows a comparison between the performance of the 
device in this study and those previously reported.[5,6,10-12,19,20] The following 
paragraphs discusse this data.  
Figure 5(a) shows the EL spectra obtained from Type III device at different 
applied voltages, from 4 to 7 V. And, Figure 5(b) shows the CIE (1931) chromaticity 
diagram, with coordinates corresponding to the emission from Type III device biased 
at different brightness levels from 120 to 14 000. The current efficiencies and the CIE 
coordinates of Type III device are 7.8 cd/A (0.33, 0.39), 8.6 cd/A (0.32, 0.34), 7.0 
cd/A (0.33, 0.40), and 6.0 cd/A (0.33, 0.39) at driving voltages of 4, 5, 6, and 7 V, 
respectively, and correspond to the brightnesses of 120, 1300, 5 000, and 14 000 
cd/m2, respectively. This data shows that Type III device has a very useful and stable 
white light emission for various applications, from regular lighting to the backlight of 
liquid crystal displays. To facilitate quantitative comparison between our present Type 
III device and some WPLEDs previously reported, we define an index ΔL, which 
corresponds to the distance from a coordinate of the individual white light to the pure 
white light (0.33, 0.33) in the CIE (1931) chromaticity diagram as listed in Table IV. 
As a result, Type III device not only has a high current efficiency, but also has a very 
small corresponding ΔL range and low applied voltage compared with other 
WPLEDs in Table IV. 
Examining the energy level diagram (as shown in Figure 6) and the nanosecond 
 20
and the relative intensity of the blue emission decreases continuously because the 
exciton on the Cz75PF main chain proceeds in a non-radiative process. Figure 7(f) 
shows the TREL spectra similar to the steady state EL spectra shown in Fig. 5 in the 
period of t = 500 to 1000 ns, which proves that the Type III device can achieve a 
stable white light emission. 
In conslusion, this study demonstrates a high current efficiency (8.6 cd/A) and 
stable white light emission (0.32, 0.34) in the device, ITO/CFx(35 W)/Cz75PF+0.26 
wt% F8BT + 0.52 wt% MEH-PPV/CsF/Ca/Al, resulting from the barrier-free hole or 
electron injection and a superior balance between hole and electron fluxes. This 
white-light-emitting PLED is single layer device fabricated by spin-coating the 
polymer blend from solution. The simple device structure and the promise of low-cost 
manufacturing make this fluorescent PLED attractive for development for 
solid-state-lighting applications.

tris(2,5-bis-2’-(9’,9’-dihexylfluorene) pyridine)iridium(III) exhibited the maximum 
brightness and current efficiency of 12000 cd/m2 and 4.3 cd/A, respectively, with a 
CIE coordinates (0.329, 0.321).10 In addition, a WPLED with a single active layer 
consisting of blue-emitting poly(9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl) end-capped 
with bis(4-methylphenyl)phenylamine, yellow-orange-emitting iridium [tri-fluorenyl] 
pyridine complex was reported by Monkman and his coworkers, and this 
phosphorescent device emitted a white light of CIE coordinates (0.348, 0.367) with a 
maximum ηext 2.8%.11 Cao and his coworkers12 presented an efficient WPLED based 
on a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-terminated PFO co-doped with 0.14 wt% 
green-emitting fac-tris[2-(4’-ter-butyl)phenylpyridine] iridium(III) and 0.14 wt% 
red-emitting bis-(1-phenylisoquinolyl)iridium(III)(1-trifluoro) acetylacetonate to 
exhibit a white emission of CIE coordinates around (0.33, 0.33) with the maximum 
current efficiency and brightness of 9 cd/A and 10200 cd/m2, respectively. Kim and 
his coworkers13 have used PVK to improve the miscibility between blue polyfluorene 
host (Blue J) and two iridium complexes of 
fac-tris[2-(2-pyridinyl-ΰN)(5-(3,4-di-sec-butoxyphenyl)phenyl)-ΰC]iridium(III) 
(Ir(PBPP)3, green emitter) and tris(1-phenylisoquinoline)iridium(III) (Ir(PIQ)3, red 
emitter), resulting in a device (BlueJ 65:PVK 25:Ir(PBPP)3 9.7:Ir(PIQ)3 0.3 by wt% 
as the emitting layer) exhibiting a white light of CIE coordinates (0.33, 0.33) with the 
maximum current efficiency and brightness of 12.52 cd/A (its corresponding ηext 
3.2%) and 11730 cd/m2, respectively. Recently, Shu and coworkers prepared a blend 
of blue and green polyfluorene copolymers (PF-TPA-OXD and FTO-BT5, 
respectively) together with red Os phosphor (Os(fppz)) as the active layer (4 wt% 
FTO-BT5 and 0.3 wt% Os(fppz)) to achieve a white device with a CIE coordinates 
(0.34, 0.32), the maximum current efficiency and ηext of 8.3 cd/A and 4.1%, 
respectively, and a maximum brightness 8698 cd/m2.23 To date, the highest current 
efficiency of electrophosphorescent WPLED (CIE coordinates (0.33, 0.34)) is 16.9 
cd/A as reported by Jen and his coworkers24 by using the blend of a yellow-emitting 
osmium complex Os(fptz)2(dppe) (1 wt%) doped into blue copolymer 
(PFCz-DPS1-OXD5) consisting of 
poly[2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-co-1,3-(5-carbazolphenylene)] and 
4-N,N-diphenylaminostilbene as the emissive layer. However, the high device 
performance is attributed to the improved electron-injection barrier due to the 
insertion of a neutral conjugated surfactant, 
poly[9,9-bis(6’-(diethanolamino)hexyl)-fluorene] (PFN-OH), between the emitting 
layer and aluminum cathode. 
However, one concern about polymer/phosphor system is that the back transfer of 
triplet energy from phosphor dopant to polymer host always occurs even though the 
 30
standards are 22000 Da and 2.6, respectively, as measured by gel permeation 
chromatography. 
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of iridium complexes solutions 
and photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of CzPPP thin film are shown in Fig. 1. As can 
be seen, the PL spectrum of CzPPP exhibits an emission peak at 430 nm as excited by 
the light of wavelength 350 nm (at its maximum UV-Vis absorbance).29 Obviously, 
there is a large spectral overlap between PL emission of CzPPP and absorption of 
metal-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) bands of two iridium complexes (410-460 nm 
for Ir-G30 and around 400-500 nm for Ir-R31). Such good spectral overlaps enable 
efficient Förster energy transfer from singlet-excited state of CzPPP to MLCT bands 
of the two dopants. 
1-4-3. Results and Discussion 
We have prepared two doping compositions, which are designated as W1 (1 wt% 
Ir-G and 0.5 wt% Ir-R) and W2 (0.5 wt% Ir-G and 0.5 wt% Ir-R). Figure 2 shows the 
corresponding PL spectra of W1 and W2 films. Apparently, when excited by the light 
of wavelength 350 nm, both W1 and W2 films exhibit three main emission peaks 
located at 430 nm corresponding to host emission and at 512 and 613 nm contributing 
from triplet emissions from Ir-G32 and Ir-R,31 respectively. This result indicates the 
efficient energy transfer from the host CzPPP to the two dopants. In addition, Fig. 2 
shows the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra of W1 and W2 films 
monitored at the emission maxima of Ir-G (512 nm) and Ir-R (613 nm). Obviously, 
both the PLE spectra resemble that of UV-Vis absorption spectrum of CzPPP 
(absorption maximum at 350 nm)29 except the minor contribution from Ir-G and Ir-R 
at the wavelength ranging from 420-500 nm, which further demonstrates that the 
emissions of Ir-G and Ir-R are actually originated from the efficient Förster energy 
transfer from singlet-excited state of CzPPP to the MLCT bands of the two 
Ir-complexes. We must emphasize that good chemical compatibility between CzPPP 
and Ir-complexes plays an important role for this observed efficient energy transfer.29 
However, a back transfer of triple energy from Ir-G to host CzPPP does not occur in 
our cases even though ET of Ir-G (2.4 eV) is higher than that of CzPPP (2.3 eV), 
resulting from the shielding provided by side chain to block the Ir-complex from 
direct contact with CzPPP backbone and thereby alleviate quenching of the triplet 
excitons in Ir complex.29 Figure 2 also shows EL spectra of W1 and W2 films at 
various applied voltages with the device structure ITO/CFx/emitting polymer layer 
(EPL)/TPBI/CsF/Ca/Al, in which CFx is a hole injection layer generated by plasma 
polymerization of CHF329 and TPBI layer is used as a hole/exciton blocking layer. 
These EL spectra give only a very small variation with the applied voltage and have 
 32
Ir-complex dopants for efficient energy transfer and ability to prevent from back- 
transfer of triplet energy results in the sharp green and red emissions from dopants 
and the enhancement of device performance.

solutions were measured from the front surface of a quartz cuvette to minimize the

(b) Syntheses of monomers and polymer 
The synthetic route of monomers and polymer is shown in Scheme 1 and the 
detailed synthetic procedures were described as below. 
b-1. 1,4-bis(octyloxy)benzene (1) 
In a three-neck reactor, hydroquinone (10 g, 90 mmol), potassium carbonate (37.3 g, 
270 mmol) and 18-crown-6 (0.24 g, 0.9 mmol) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO, 300 ml) and the mixture was stirred at 70 ℃ for 10 min under nitrogen 
atmosphere. Then, 1-bromooctane (38.2 g, 198 mmol) was added and the reaction 
mixture was stirred for 24 hr at 70 ℃. After that, the mixture was poured into ice 
water and the precipitate was filtered. The precipitate was dissolved in ether and the 
solution was washed with water followed by being dried over anhydrous magnesium 
sulfate. Finally, the solvent was removed under vacuum and the residual crude 
product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, and hexane was used as 
the effluent) to give a white solid product (16.8 g, yield 55 %). MS: m/z, 334 (M+). 
b-2. 1,4-diiodo-2,5-bis(octyloxy)benzene(2) 
1,4-bis(octyloxy)benzene (15 g, 44.9 mmol), potassium iodate (3.83 g, 17.9 mmol), 
and iodine (12.6 g, 0.0496 mol) were added to a stirred solution consisting of acetic 
acid (270 ml), sulfuric acid (96%, 4.8 ml), and R. O. water (20 ml). The reaction 
mixture was refluxed with stirring for 16 hr and then cooled to room temperature. 
Sodium sulfate aqueous solution (20%) was added until the brown color of iodine 
disappeared. Then, the mixture was poured into ice water (500 ml) and the precipitate 
was filtered. The precipitate was dissolved in ether and the solution was washed with 
water followed by being dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Ether was finally 
evaporated under vacuum to give an oil-like material with yellow to brown color. This 
crude material was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane as 
effluent) to give a white solid product (7.85 g, yield 30%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, 
CDCl3). δ (ppm): 7.24 (s, 2H), 3.902 (t, 4H), 1.773 (m, 4H), 1.469 (m, 4H), 1.275 (m, 
16H), 0.866 (t, 6H). MS: m/z, 586 (M+). 
b-3. 2,5-dibromohydroquinone (3) 
Under nitrogen atmosphere, hydroquinone (20 g, 181.6 mmol) was added to a 
reactor equipped with a trap filled with potassium hydroxide (0.02 M) for quenching 
HBr gas evolved with the reaction. Dichloromethane (50 ml) and glacial acetic acid

1-5-3. Results and Discussion 
(a) Preparation of dR8OPPP 
As shown in Table 1, for entries 1-5 using DMF and toluene as solvent 1 and 2, 
respectively, polymerization of iodo-type monomer (i.e., 
1,4-diiodo-2,5-bis(octyloxy)benzene) yield dR8OPPPs with molecular weight less 
than 5,000 Dalton (Da.) no matter how the reaction conditions including reaction time 
(from 48 to 168 hr, entries 1 and 2), catalyst equivalent (from 1.6 to 3.2 eq., entries 1 
and 3), reaction temperature and monomer concentration (from 60 ℃ and 0.28 M to 
80 ℃ and 0.56 M, entries 4 and 5) are changed. This result indicates that iodo-type 
monomer is not suitable for Yamamoto polycondensation. On the other hand, 
adopting bromo-type monomer (i.e., 1,4-dibromo-2,5-bis(octyloxy)benzene)) with 
DMF/toluene as the mix-solvent can not yield dR8OPPPs with very high molecular 
weight (only about 15,600 Da.) under some reaction conditions including the different 
reaction time (from 8 to 48 hr, entries 6 and 7) and catalyst equivalent (, from 1.6 to 
3.2 eq., entries 6 and 8). However, the molecular weight can be obviously improved 
to reach 55,000 Da. (entry 11) while the monomer concentration is increased (entries 
8–11). But, when the monomer concentration is above 0.3 M, the generated 
high-molecule-weight polymer will precipitate from the reaction mixture, causing that 
its molecular weight can not be further increased. 
In order to resolve the issue of polymer precipitation in high monomer 
concentration, we try to adopt THF as reaction solvent for avoiding the occurrence of 
this phenomenon (entries 12–18). We observed that dR8OPPP does not precipitate 
from reaction mixture while THF is used to replace toluene as solvent 2 (entry 12). In 
addition, based on the use of THF as mono-solvent, the molecular weight of dR8OPPP 
can be remarkably promoted by increasing concentration of bromo-type monomer as 
shown in entries 13–15. The maximum molecular weight achieved is about 166,000 
Da. (entry 15, with a monomer concentration of 0.28 M) as Suzuki polycondensation 
did [4], and its corresponding polydispersity index (PDI) is below 2.5. However, the 
precipitation of polymer still occurs in the case of the much higher monomer 
concentration (≧ 0.33 M) and the molecular weight of generated dR8OPPP returns to 
be low (less than 110,000 Da.). 
The molecular weight of dR8OPPP versus concentration of bromo-type monomer 
based on two types of solvents (one is the mix-solvent consisting of DMF and toluene, 
and the other is mono-solvent THF) are shown in Figure 1 (plotted according to the 
data of entries 8–11 and 13–18 in Table 1). Obviously, THF as solvent can increase 
molecular weight of dR8OPPP especially in the region of higher monomer 
 42
from the concentrated dR8OPPP solution (2.5 wt% in THF, see Figure 4(b)) show that 
the wavelength of main emission peak continuously red-shifts from 420 to 442 nm 
while the excitation wavelength is increased from 340 to 400 nm and the spectrum 
(obtained by exciting at the long wavelength of 400 nm) resembles to that of 
dR8OPPP film (as shown in Figure 3). The spectrum change with the excitation 
wavelength indicates that there is another emitting species in addition to single chain; 
and directly exciting the long-wavelength absorption component (400 nm) can obtain 
a spectrum similar to that of dR8OPPP film (emission mainly comes from aggregates 
emission) means that the new emitting species is aggregates [6]. 
  To understand why dR8OPPP is easy to form aggregates, wide-angle X-ray 
diffraction (WAXD) measurement was performed. Figure 5 is a WAXD profile of 
drop-casted dR8OPPP film on a glass substrate and there is an intense and sharp 
diffraction peak located at 3.2°. The corresponding layer periodicity for this 
diffraction peak is 25.8 Å and is related to the side chain alignment in dR8OPPP film 
[7]. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that aggregates formation in dR8OPPP is 
induced by the order structure of dR8OPPP side chain. 
In conclusion, we present an optimum polymerization condition for Yamamoto 
polycondensation to achieve high-molecule-weight dR8OPPP (Mw = 166,000 Da. and 
PDI is below 2.5) comparable to that prepared by Suzuki method in a shorter reaction 
time based on the use of THF as solvent and high monomer concentration (0.28 M). 
THF used as reaction solvent can improve the solubility of nickel (0) catalyst and 
polymer, thus preventing from the precipitation of polymer and enhancing the 
reactivity of polymerization. The order structure of dR8OPPP side chain induces 
aggregates formation and the aggregates contribute to a large red-shifted emission in 
thin-film state.

Abstract This article mainly reviews the approaches that have been proposed to im-
prove the device performance of polyﬂuorene (PF)-based polymer light-emitting diodes
(PLEDs). Chemical modiﬁcations on main chains, side chains, and chain ends of PFs
via the incorporation of charge-transport moieties can reduce the hole- and electron-
injection barriers; while physical manipulation on main-chain structures of PFs, poly(9,9-
di-n-octylﬂuorene) (PFO), after dipping in mixed solvent/non-solvent (tetrahydrofu-
ran/methanol) can generate β-phase with extended conjugation length, leading to a pro-
moted charge balance and stable pure blue emission. Hole- and electron-injection
barriers can be effectively lowered by the insertion of hole-transport and electron-
injection layers, respectively. The recent development of PFs with various emission colors,
via physical blending or chemical modiﬁcation, are presented for a comprehensive under-
standing of PFs for device applications. The deliberate choice of cathode material with
work function matching the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PFs is
another efﬁcient method for increasing electron ﬂux, and is also discussed in this review.

Design of Hole Blocking Layer with
Electron Transport Channels for High
Performance Polymer Light-Emitting Diodes**
By Chung-Chin Hsiao, An-En Hsiao, and Show-An Chen*
Organic and polymeric light-emitting diodes (OLEDs and
PLEDs) have drawn great attention in recent years because of
their scientific importance and potentially commercial applica-
tions.[1,2] However, the stability and performance of PLEDs
are in needs of further improvement due to imbalanced hole
and electron fluxes and poor charge injection efficiency. There-
fore, considerable efforts have been devoted to the studies on
interfacial engineering for improving the device performance,
which include modifications of indium tin oxide (ITO),[3,4] use
of alkaline metal fluorides[5,6] and inorganic salt[7–11] as
cathode, and incorporation of hole blocking/electron transport
layer.[12,13] The various materials, like low work function
metals Ca and Ba,[14,15] thin insulator layers LiF and CsF both
covered with Al,[5,6] composite cathodes LiF and CsF both
covered with Ca,[16] and inorganic salts CH3COOCs, NaOH,
and Cs2CO3 all covered with Al,
[7–11] were all used as an
electron injection layer/cathode in an attempt to enhance the
electron injection in the OLEDs or PLEDs. However, the
work functions of Ca and Ba are still not low enough to match
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of
most conjugated polymers.[14,15] And, the alkaline metal
fluoride insulator (LiF or CsF) needs to be reduced to Li or
Cs by the Ca or Al covered on top of it in order to be
effective.[5,6] Among the salts, Cs2CO3 has drawn considerable
attentions due to its capability of dissolving in highly polar
solvent[10] and of decomposition to yield Cs and Cs2O during
vacuum thermal deposition.[9,11] Huang et al.[10] spin-coated
Cs2CO3 layer (about several nm) from its dilute solution in
2-ethoxythanol on top of the emitting polymer, poly(9,9-
dioctylfluorene) (PFO), to enhance the electron injection and
to block hole carriers at the PFO/Cs2CO3 interface, leading to a
better charge balance. But uniformity of the thin Cs2CO3 layer
was not shown. Li et al.[11] found that the thermal deposition of
Cs2CO3 which decomposes into Cs and Cs2O during the
evaporation onto the emitting layer gives improved electron
injection, but does not provide a hole blocking effect.
In addition to the modifications of electrodes, many efforts
have been attempted to reduce an imbalance in hole and
electron fluxes and a possible quenching by cathode by
introducing a hole blocking layer (which was also claimed as an
electron transport layer),[12,13] since in conjugated polymers
hole mobility is often larger than electron mobility leading to a
recombination zone very close to the cathode.[17,18] Hirayama
et al.[12] and Tseng et al.[13] inserted a layer of polyfluorene-
based copolymer between MEH-PPV and Ca cathode and a
layer of 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl) benzene (TPBI)
between PFO and Ca cathode as hole blocking layer leading to
the improved current efficiency from 1.0 to 3.6 cdA1 and 0.61
to 1.45 cdA1, respectively. However, their maximum bright-
nesses 10 000 and 2 000 cdm2 are still relative low as
compared with our previous reports (34 400[3] (MEH-PPV-
based device) and 8 400[12] cdm2 (PFO-based device)) due to
the high electron injection barrier and low electron transport
capability and insufficiently high hole blocking barrier
provided by these hole blocking layers. In other words, the
definition of the so-called hole blocking/electron transport
layer given in the previous reports is ambiguous.
Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a novel dual-
functional composite layer having superior hole blocking effect
along with promising electron transport (HB-ET) capability
for the two model electroluminescent polymers, PFO and
MEH-PPV. The dual-functional composite layer is composed
of a nonconjugated polymer, (such as polyethyleneoxide
(PEO)) or a conjugated molecular material, (such as TPBI)
as well as an inorganic salt (such as Cs2CO3), which allows an
effective recombination of electrons and holes and results in a
high device performance. Furthermore, the composite bilayer
cathode Cs2CO3(2 nm)/Ca(3 nm) is also introduced, which can
enhance the electron injection dramatically. For PFO device,
introducing PEO doped with 20wt% Cs2CO3 as HB-ET
layer gives the maximum brightness (Bmax) 27 000 cdm
2 and
current efficiency (hmax) 3.5 cdA
1 with the pure blue emission
at CIEx,y (0.16, 0.07), where the pure blue emission is defined as
xþ y2 0.3. For MEH-PPV device, introducing TPBI doped
with 10wt% Cs2CO3 by thermal co-evaporation as HB-ET
layer provides Bmax 62 000 cdm
2 and hmax 5.7 cdA
1, equi-
valent to the external quantum efficiency (hext) 2.2%. To the
best of our knowledge, these performance results are the best
among those reported PLEDs using PFOor MEH-PPV as the
emitting layer,[3,4,8,10,11,13,15,19–22] where no further treatment is
made such as dipping method in our previous report.[23]
In electroluminescent (EL) conjugated polymers, hole
mobility is usually higher than electron mobility. However,
in their devices, EL polymer with higher hole mobility does not

Abstract
We synthesize a series of soluble phenylene-based electroluminescent (EL) polymers with deep blue emission by incorporations of dialkoxy
groups (DRO-PPP) and alkoxy-phenyl group (EHB-PPP) on side chains as well as carbazole unit on main chain (EHB-PPP-Cz) using the
Yamamoto coupling approach. The latter two modifications (EHB-PPP and EHB-PPP-Cz) lead to blue-shifts in absorption and emission maxima
relative to DRO-PPP. In addition, the incorporation of carbazole as co-repeat-unit (EHB-PPP-Cz) leads to a raise of ionization potential (IP) to
the level very close to that of the anode, PEDOT:PSS, to facilitate the hole injection. The maximum efficiency of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/EHB-PPP-
Cz/TPBI/CsF/Ca/Al device is 1.12 cd/A with a stable deep blue EL with CIE (0.16, 0.05).

1. Introduction
Electroluminescent (EL) conjugated polymers have drawn
great attention in the past decade. One of its promising appli-
cations is full-color display. Among the three basic colors red,
green and blue, pursuing blue EL polymers with high efficiency
and good color purity remains a challenge. Furthermore, the
development of blue EL polymers is the subject of intense
research in both academia and industry, since they can be used
as the active layer in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) or
as host material for internal color conversion.
Poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) derivatives have been synthesized
as the first materials for blue PLED [1]. Subsequently, ladder
type PPP [2,3], polyfluorenes (PFs) [4–8], polycarbazoles (PCs)
[9], and polythiophene derivatives (PTs) [10–13] have also been
intensively studied for use as blue emitters, among which PF
derivatives have drawn great attention for their high photolumi-
nescence (PL) quantum efficiency. However, an additional green
emission band is often observed [14,15], leading to a broadband
emission and color instability. Such phenomenon was attributed
to an interchain aggregation and/or excimer formation [16].

Due to the large ring torsion angle (about 23◦) between
two neighboring benzene rings, PPP and its derivatives are
intrinsically violet-blue emitters [17]. They exhibit excellent
electrochemical and thermal stabilities as well as ease of syn-
thesis, but accompanying with low efficiency and high turn-on
voltage in its PLED application. Therefore, some attempts to
solve these two problems have been made [18,19].
In this paper, we synthesize the novel deep blue light-
emitting polymers, poly(2-(4′-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-benzene)-p-
phenylene) (EHB-PPP) and poly(2-(4′-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-
benzene)-1,4-phenylene-co-3,6-carbazole) (EHB-PPP-Cz) via
Yamamoto coupling method [20]. EHB-PPP, in which each
phenylene unit is grafted with alkoxyphenyl, gives a promoted
luminescence quantum efficiency in comparison with DRO-PPP
and provides deep blue emission. EHB-PPP-Cz, in which the
carbazole unit (3,6-carbazole), is introduced by copolymerizing
with alkoxyphenyl substituted phenylene, provides more bal-
anced hole and electron fluxes and therefore a promoted devices
efficiency.

Effect of ionization potential change in poly„3,4-

Poly3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrenesulfonic acid PEDOT:PSS is usually used to
facilitate hole injection in polymer light emitting diodes. The authors used ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy to investigate ionization potential IP changes of PEDOT:PSS spin coated on indium
tin oxide ITO, and found that increasing delay time to baking after spin coating decreases its IP
and increases hole injection barrier to emitting polymer. The IP change is attributed to dedoping of
PEDOT in PEDOT:PSS due to reaction of ITO with protons in PSS and those in doped PEDOT in
the presence of water. To get good performance of bipolar device, PEDOT:PSS film should be baked
right after spin coating. © 2007 American Institute of Physics. DOI: 10.1063/1.2759474
Poly3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrenesulfonic
acid PEDOT:PSS coated on indium tin oxide ITO is
widely used as hole injection layer in polymer light emitting
diodes PLEDs and also for preventing direct contact be-
tween ITO and emitting layer. However, sulfonic acid groups
of PSS can react with ITO and result in the formation of salts
of indium and tin. A small amount of indium diffused into
PEDOT:PSS layer was observed by x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy XPS.1–3 de Jong et al.1 found that 0.02 at. %
indium appeared in the PEDOT:PSS film. The amount of
dissolved indium increased to a saturation level of 1.2 at. %
after several days in air. The dissolution of indium was
explained by etching ITO due to the strong acidic nature
of PSS. In order to get rid of indium from PEDOT:PSS film
and improve the stability of PLEDs, a hydrochloric acid
HCl etching was used to modify the PEDOT:PSS film by
rinsing the film with a diluted 10% HCl solution for
1–10 min.2
Due to the hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS espe-
cially free PSS, Kawano et al.4 found that the main factor
for degradation of solar cells with PEDOT:PSS layer is
the absorption of water by PEDOT:PSS. In the devices
without PEDOT:PSS, however, only minimal degradation
was observed. They even found that the effect of absorbed
water in PEDOT:PSS layer resulted in increases in resistivity
of device and energy barrier at PEDOT:PSS/polymer
interface.
The ionization potential IP of PEDOT:PSS film was
found to change as the pH value of its solution was adjusted
by aqueous base.5 Its IP did not change as pH value was
greater than 1.5. At low pH value pH1.5 range, however,
IP of PEDOT:PSS decreased as pH value increased, and in
the meantime, its Fermi level which located inside the va-
lence band moved toward the top of the valence band as pH
value increased. The same group6 also used optical and Ra-
man spectroscopies to compare the difference before and af-
ter the treatment with bases and deduced that the increase of
pH value gave an effect similar to dedoping, which was at-
tributed to a change in relative stability of polarons and bi-
polarons on the doped thiophene backbone.
In this work, we show that the protons in PEDOT:PSS
can react with ITO in the presence of water to yield indium
salt leading to a change of its IP, and the indium ions can
diffuse into the PEDOT:PSS layer. The extent of reaction
increases with delay time to baking after spin coating of
PEDOT:PSS and its effect on device performance is also
provided.
The PEDOT:PSS solution used was Baytron AI 4083
from Bayer. ITO from Merck was cleaned via a routine
procedure7 and was then spin coated with a 20 nm
PEDOT:PSS film. Before baking at 140 °C, the PEDOT:PSS
coated ITO was stored in a glovebox with argon for different
periods of time 0–48 h delay times. These PEDOT:PSS
films on ITO were then measured by XPS and UV photoelec-
tron spectroscopy UPS from VG, MultiLab 2000 for their
IP values and content of indium. Details about sample prepa-
ration and transferring to UPS or XPS chamber are given in
our previous article.7 By investigating the effects of indium
content in PEDOT layer, 20 mg of In2O3 from Alfa chemi-
cals was added to 10 ml PEDOT:PSS solution and stirred
for 3 day. Undesolved In2O3 was then filtered out after soni-
cating the solution for 6 h. The pH values of the solutions
with and without adding In2O3 were then measured. The PE-
DOT:PSS film with In2O3 prepared therefrom coated on ITO
was also measured for its IP by UPS.
It is known that very minor amount of water always
appears in PEDOT:PSS film even after baking due to its
hygroscopic nature,4 the amount will increase upon absorp-
tion of moisture from leaked air in the device. In order
to investigate the role of water content, we keep the
PEDOT:PSS film wet for various periods of time before bak-
ing. The result is expected to simulate the moisture effect on
the performance of an encapsulated device with PEDOT:PSS
film exposed in an ambient environment for a long period of
time. The IP values of PEDOT:PSS films 20 nm on ITO of
different delay times to baking are shown in Fig. 1. The IP
value decreases as the delay time to baking increases, from
5.45 eV 0 h to 5.32 eV 48 h, and the trend moves to-
ward that of the neutral PEDOT, around 3.93–4.0 eV,8,9 in-aElectronic mail: sachen@che.nthu.edu.tw

Abstract
By introducing CFx thin ﬁlm as hole injection layer on top of indium tin oxide (ITO) anode via plasma polymerization
of CHF3, the device with poly(9,9-dioctylﬂuorene) (PFO) as emitting layer, ITO/CFx(35 W)/PFO/CsF/Ca/Al, is prepared.
At the optimal C/F atom ratio using the radio frequency power 35 W, the device performance is optimal having the max-
imum current eﬃciency 3.1 cd/A and maximum brightness 8400 cd/m2. This is attributed to a better balance between hole
and electron ﬂuxes, resulting from a decrease in hole injection barrier as manifested by ultraviolet photoelectron spectros-
copy and scanning surface potential microscopy.

1. Introduction
The interfaces between emitting conjugated poly-
mer and electrodes are central to the physics of
polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) [1], since a
mismatch between polymer’s highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) with work functions of
the electrodes can lead to poor charge injections
into the device. To minimize carrier (hole or elec-
tron) injection barrier of PLED, many eﬀorts have
been attempted [2–11]. For example, by using alka-
line metal ﬂuoride (LiF [2], LiF/Ca [3], CsF [4], or
CsF/Ca [4]) or its composite as the cathode, the
electron injection barrier can be reduced to enhance
electron injection. For improving hole injection,
various treatments for indium tin oxide (ITO) as
the anode have also been reported, including a coat-
ing with self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based on
4,4 0-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl)phenylamino]
biphenyl (TPD–Si2) [5], wet aquaregia treatment [6],

In molecular design of electroluminescent (EL) conjugated polymers, introducing a charge transport moiety
on a side chain is found to be a promising method for balancing electron and hole fluxes in EL devices
without changing the emitting color if there is no interaction between moiety and main chain. In the case of
grafting a carbazole (Cz) moiety (hole transporting) on blue emitting polyfluorene, a green emission appears
with intensity comparable to the blue emission, which was attributed to a possible interaction between main
chain and Cz as previously reported by us. Here, a detailed study of its EL mechanism was carried out by
means of time-resolved EL with the assistance of molecular simulation and thermally stimulated current
measurements; exploration of how main chain segments interact with the transport moiety was performed.
We found the Cz groups in Cz100PF play multiple roles: they act as (1) hole transporter to improve hole
injection, (2) hole trapping site for efficient electron-hole recombination to yield blue-emitting excitons, and
(3) source of green emission from electroplex formed via electric field-mediated interaction of the Cz/Cz
radical cation with an electron in the nearby PF backbone. In combination, these observations suggest that
integrated consideration for both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions provides a new route of
molecular design of efficient EL polymers.
Introduction
Charge injection and charge mobility are two crucial factors
in designing electroluminescent (EL) polymers for polymer light
emitting diodes (PLED). The most studied EL polymers are
poly(phenylene vinylene)s (PPVs) and polyfluorenes (PFs),1
which have been found to be hole transport-dominated materials
because their hole mobilities are 1-3 orders higher than their
electron mobilities.2 Extensive efforts have been made for
developing new emissive semiconducting polymers with im-
proved electron transport characteristics via the introduction of
electron-deficient moieties inserted in the backbone through
straightforward copolymerization3 or attached directly onto (and
in conjugation with) the backbone;4 in both cases, the emissive
wavelength is often altered. A more attractive alternative is to
attach the electron deficient group at the end of a long flexible
spacer linked to the backbone5 as reported by us5a,b,e and
others5c,d for designing EL polymers by modifying the hole
dominating soluble poly(p-phenylene vinylene) through intro-
ducing a proper amount of the typical electron deficient moiety,
the oxadiazole (OXD) group, on ends of its long flexible side
chains. Such modification in addition leads to a more amorphous
chain arrangement such that the OXD moieties are dispersed
uniformly in the main chain matrix.5b The device prepared has
a low turn-on voltage and high EL efficiency. We also reported5e
that the hole-dominating soluble PPV was modified through
introducing the highly electron-deficient moiety, the triazole
(TAZ) group, on ends of its long flexible side chains, allowing
a conversion from hole-dominated transport to electron-
dominated transport. The device prepared has a high EL
efficiency due to a balance of charge carrier mobilities and
densities. For polyfluorenes, similar modifications by introduc-
ing OXD6a and additional hole-transporting triphenylamine6b
as side chains at the C-9 position also have been attempted.
This approach is adopted based on the consideration that no
interaction occurs between the transport moiety and the con-
jugated main chain and thus can be termed as a single chain
consideration.
Interactions between the charge transport moiety and the
conjugated main chain, however, can be expected to occur in
two ways: (a) by directly attaching to repeat units or polymer
chain ends with a conjugation interaction in their ð-systems at
the ground state7 and (b) through molecular stacking such that
the interaction occurs at the excited state under electric fields8a
(electroplex or electromer formation).8b,c,d The electroplex
(M+N-) is an electronically excited emitting species, which
forms only under an electric field by cross-recombination of
electrons in the acceptor (N) and the holes in the donor (M)
molecules (or segments).8b The electroplex is an analogue of
the photoexcited emitting species, exciplex (M*N), in which
the donor molecule is at the excited state M* and the acceptor
molecule is at the ground state N. In both cases, if M and N are
of the same kind of molecule (or segments), the complex pairs
are termed electromer8d and excimer,8e respectively. Note that
the essential difference in structure between the electroplex and
the exciplex is that the former involves a cross-recombination
of the radical cation (M+) and radical anion (N-), while the
latter involves a charge transfer interaction between M* and N.

Determination of aggregates as charge trapping and recombination centers

A presence of aggregates can give critical influences on photophysical properties of conjugated
polymer. For poly2-methoxy-5-2-ethylhexyloxy-1,4-phenylene vinylene, the authors found that
the aggregates can serve as charge traps and recombination centers by using time-resolved
electroluminescence spectroscopy, and that the emissions from isolated chains and aggregates show
different dynamics. The authors also found that the highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO and
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital LUMO of aggregates lie within the band gap of isolated
chains. Thus, the aggregates act as shallow traps for both electron and hole so that a reexcitation to
HOMO and LUMO of isolated chains is possible. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

Electroluminescence EL and charge transport proper-
ties of conjugated polymers have received great attention
since the discovery of polymer light emitting diode in 1990.1
It is known that both photophysical and electrical properties
of the polymers are decisive factors for determining the EL
efficiency. Studies on the photophysics2–4 reveal an occur-
rence of strong interchain or intrachain interactions between
lumophores. These interactions can generate new emission
species, such as excimer, exciplex, and aggregate, leading to
low-energy emissions in the fluorescence spectrum. Aggre-
gates come from intermolecular interaction involving two or
more lumophores in the ground state by extending the delo-
calization of -electrons over these conjugated segments.
Photophysical properties and structures of aggregates in
polyphenylene vinylene have been reported in our previous
works,5–7 in which energy transfer from isolated chains to
aggregates of various extents of alignment was observed. By
use of time-resolved photoluminescence measurement in
studying energy transfer mechanism involving aggregates,
we suggested that aggregates behave as a low-energy dopant
in isolated-chain host. However, information on charge trans-
port properties about aggregates is very limited because sev-
eral steps are involved, such as charge injections, charge
transport, and recombination of hole and electron. poly2-
methoxy-5-2-ethylhexyloxy-1,4-phenylene vinylene
MEH-PPV cast from aromatic solvents, such as chloroben-
zene CB and toluene, can induce more aggregates than
from nonaromatic solvent, resulting in higher current density
in the devices.8 An annealed MEH-PPV device also gave
similar results. However, from time-of-flight measurement,
hole transport in an annealed MEH-PPV film was found to
be dispersive and the hole mobility dropped by one order of
magnitude as compared to that of as-cast film.9 The changes
of transport properties were attributed to an inhomogeneity
in chain arrangement and to a presence of traps from more
ordered regions.10
For studies of charge transport and recombination pro-
cesses in the device,11–13 the pulsed electrical excitation
method has been used for measurements of transient elec-
troluminescence. However, only the dynamics of integrated
spectra or single wavelength transients has been reported. In
this letter, we report the dynamics of complete emission
spectra of MEH-PPV with the presence of aggregates by
using time-resolved electroluminescence TREL technique,
by which charge trapping and recombination mechanisms in
the device with MEH-PPV can be revealed. The aggregates
could serve as charge traps and recombination centers with
shallow trap depths.
Indium-tin oxide ITO glass substrate was treated with
oxygen plasma. A thin hole-injection layer 25 nm of poly-
styrene sulfonic acid doped polyethylenedoixythiophene
Baytron P CH 8000 from Bayer, designated as PEDOT for
simplicity was spin coated on ITO. A thin layer 100 nm of
MEH-PPV was spin coated from its solution in CB. Finally,
a thin layer of calcium covered with a layer of aluminum was
deposited as the cathode at a pressure of less than 5
10−6 Torr. The active area of the device is about 10 mm2.
TREL measurement was performed using the apparatus
consisting of a time-resolved spectrometer Edinburgh
Lifespec-ps and a pulse generator Avtech AV-1012-B. The
pulse width 500–600 ns, amplitude 5.5–6 V, and repeti-
tion rate 500 kHz, equivalent to the cycle time of 2000 ns
were chosen to fit the instrumental setup. The rising time of
the pulse voltage is less than 10 ns. Each time-resolved spec-
trum was obtained by recording a set of single wavelength
decay and then taking intensities at some specific times to
construct the spectrum. Due to weak intensity at the edge of
the emission spectrum, 6–12 h are needed to obtain clear
information.
Figure 1a shows the electroluminescence spectra from
the device with MEH-PPV film spun cast from its solution in
chlorobenzene measured before and after TREL measure-
ment. As can be seen, the EL spectra are nearly identical
before and after 12 h operation, indicating that under the
pulsed voltage, effects of joule heat and polarization can be
eliminated. Therefore, any change in TREL spectra if any

High Triplet Energy Polymer as Host for
Electrophosphorescence with High Efficiency
Yen-Chun Chen, Guo-Sheng Huang,† Chung-Chin Hsiao, and Show-An Chen*
Contribution from the Chemical Engineering Department, National Tsing-Hua UniVersity,

Abstract: We report the conjugated polymer P(tBu-CBP) as a host with high triplet energy (ET 2.53 eV)
and suitable HOMO (5.3 eV) and LUMO (2.04 eV) energy levels. Upon doping with green and red emission
Ir-complexes, it gives devices with high luminous and external quantum efficiencies for green emission
(23.7 cd/A, 6.57%) and for red emission (5.1 cd/A, 4.23%), respectively, and low turn-on voltage (3 V). For
both devices, the efficiencies are higher than those of the corresponding devices with the same backbone
P(3,6-Cz) as a host by a factor of 4, even though the latter has an ET (2.6 eV) slightly higher than that of
the former. The results reflect that, in phosphorescent devices, the difference in ET between the host and
guest is not the only factor that determines the device efficiency, and the present side group modification
via the 9 position of carbazole also plays an important role, which allows a tuning of HOMO and LUMO
levels to provide more balance in electron and hole fluxes and provides prevention from formation of excimer.
Introduction
Doping heavy metal complexes1 (e.g., Ir and Pt complexes)
into host materials in an organic light emitting diode for
obtaining high external quantum efficiency has attracted great
attention, owing to their efficient intersystem crossing from
singlet to triplet excited states followed by relaxing through
phosphorescence. Thus, an electrophosphorescent (EP) device,
allowing us to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons, is an
efficient approach over a purely fluorescent device where only
singlet exciton provides a radiative pathway. For an efficient
device, the host matrix should fulfill energy-level matching with
neighboring layers or electrodes for efficient charge injections
and with the guest for effective energy transfer of singlet
excitons and for efficient triplet confinement at the guest2
(requiring a higher triplet energy ET than that of the guest).
Studies on a high efficiency EP device with a conjugated
polymer as a host in red emission have been extensive,3 but in
green4a and blue emissions they are scarce due to the unavail-
ability of high ET polymers (at least higher than the ET of the
green guest 2.4 eV for an Ir-complex).2b Recently a polycar-
bazole (P(3,6-Cz)) with an interconnection of carbazole units
in 3,6 positions was reported as a potential candidate for a host
from a quantum-chemical study4b-4c and found experimentally4a
to give a high efficiency green device (16 cd/A) when doped
with a green emitting Ir-complex. This polymer possesses high
ET (2.6 eV) and suitable highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO, 5.25 eV) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO, 2.05 eV) levels allowing ease of charge injections
relative to the anode poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-
(styrenesulfonate) (denoted as PEDOT:PSS for simplicity) and
cathode (Ba/Al). However, it has drawbacks: imbalanced charge
fluxes4a and formation of a lower energy emission band, which
was claimed as an excimer emission.5 The formation of excimer
usually lowers the photoluminescence quantum efficiency
(PLQE) resulting in a lowering rate constant for the Fo¨rster
energy transfer.6

Determination of trap polarity in conjugated electroluminescent polymer
by photoexcitation thermally stimulated current method

We succeed in using a photoexcitation thermally stimulated current TSC technique for a
determination of trap states for poly2-methoxy-5-2’-ethylhexyloxy-1,4-phenylene vinylene
MEH-PPV. By use of this method, the trap polarity can be easily and clearly assigned. We provide
direct evidence that molecular oxygen can form electron traps in MEH-PPV, while moisture cannot
result in detectable hole traps. An unusual negative field-dependent TSC is observed for detrapping
electron current, indicating a lowering of electron mobility under increased electric field. The state
of observed hole trap is not affected by an exposure to ambient air and by a change of morphology,
but can be attributed to extrinsic impurities or structure defects. © 2006 American Institute of
Physics. DOI: 10.1063/1.2168042
Conjugated polymers have attracted much attention due
to their outstanding semiconductive and fluorescent proper-
ties and have been developed for applications in full color
display,1 field-effect transistors,2 and solar cells.3 The pres-
ence of trap was found to affect charge transport and perfor-
mance of the device.4,5 Therefore, identification of origins
and states of traps is of fundamental importance in improv-
ing device efficiency. Oxygen and moisture are common
sources of impurities in conjugated polymers and have spe-
cific interactions with conjugated backbone.5,6 Oxygen was
found to be an electron trap due to its high electron affinity,7
while moisture was claimed to serve as a hole trap,8 for
which no direct evidence was provided. Thermally stimu-
lated current TSC has been used to determine trap states in
organic small molecule9–11 and conjugated polymers,12–16 by
which, in the presence of molecular oxygen, reversible trap/
detrap currents in polyp-phenylene vinylene PPV was
reported.12 For poly2-methoxy-5-2’-ethylhexyloxy–1,4–
phenylene vinylene MEH-PPV, a TSC peak at about 250
K was found, but the origin of the trap was not reported.13,14
In our previous work,15 two trap states were found in MEH-
PPV and both were attributed to a presence of oxygen and
moisture from ambient air.
In all the abovementioned reports, trap polarities were
not assigned. It has been reported that trap filling electrically
with single carrier device can distinguish the trap
polarity.10,11 However, trapped and polarization charges can
be induced simultaneously during the filling procedure,
which complicates an identification of origins of the released
currents. Besides, no or very small TSC signals were de-
tected by electric filling in comparison with that by optical
filling, resulting from a presence of nonuniform conducting
paths in the disorder systems or from inefficient injection
contacts.10,15 Furthermore, a fabrication of an appropriate
electron-only device is quite complicated due to high reac-
tivity of metal electrode with oxygen and moisture. A photo-
excitation PE-TSC method has been proposed for assigning
the hole trap in polyN-vinylcarbazole/polycarbonate
blends16 by changing the penetration depth of optical trap
filling via excitation wavelength selection or changing film
thickness i.e., changing transporting distance for detrapped
carriers. A shift of TSC signal under same drain field can
provide information on trap polarity.
In this letter, we demonstrate a more convenient method
of PE-TSC for assigning trap polarity in MEH-PPV, using a
wavelength at which the absorbance is high for optically
filling the traps in near-surface region. At elevated tempera-
tures, the detrapping carriers can be collected by the vicinal
electrode or drift through the sample to the counter electrode
i.e., traveling a longer distance under opposite drain field.
A longer transporting distance will cause a time delay in the
collection of carriers and thus result in TSC signals at higher
temperature when heating at a constant rate. Therefore, the
trap polarity can be assigned from the variation of TSC peak
locations. By this method, we can ensure that a variation of
TSC signal is not due to nonuniform distribution of traps in
the sample. This consideration is important for the noniso-
tropic systems, especially for polymer/small molecule
blends, which generally involve serious phase separation.17
We also apply time of flight TOF measurement to support
an interpretation of TSC result. We succeed in assigning trap
polarities and provide direct evidence that molecular oxygen
can form electron traps while moisture cannot result in de-
tectable hole traps. Moreover, an unusual negative field de-
pendent TSC for detrapping electron was observed for the
first time.
Devices with the structure indium tin oxide ITO/MEH-
PPV/Al were fabricated in an argon glovebox integrated with
a thermal evaporator system. MEH-PPV films were coated
on ITO glass substrates by drop casting from their solutions
in chlorobenzene. The experimental details for PE-TSC mea-
surement, TOF measurement, and device fabrication are de-
scribed in our previous letters.15,18 The excitation wavelength
used in TOF measurement is 490 nm close to the max of
UV-visible absorption, 495 nm17 for ensuring a minimum
penetration depth. In PE-TSC measurement, initially, the
sample was heated to a temperature with 10 K higher than
the highest temperature of measurement in order to “clean
out” residual carriers trapped in the sample. At this tempera-

Excimer Formation by Electric Field Induction and Side Chain Motion
Assistance in Polyfluorenes

ABSTRACT: For poly(9,9-di(6-(2-(3-oxetanyl)butoxyl)hexyl)-2,7-fluorene) (POBOHF), measurements on
field induction-thermally stimulated current (FI-TSC) and electroluminescence (EL) under a wide
temperature range demonstrate that electric field induction (FI) accompanied by side chain motion can
lead to a formation of excimers, which contribute to a growth of a green component in the EL spectrum.
This phenomenon also happens to poly(9,9-di-n-octyl-2,7-fluorene) (PFO), especially under long-term
operations with higher electric fields (1  106 V/cm), copolymers of OBOHF and FO (PF-1/1 and PF-1/3),
and even cross-linked POBOHF. The higher polarity of the side chain in the polyfluorenes (PFs) can
cause a more pronounced FI effect. For POBOHF, the green component can even dominate after a few
cycles of device operation. Lowering the content of cross-linkable commoner in the copolymers from 50 to
25 mol % only moderately suppresses the formation of FI excimers.
Introduction
The applications of conjugated polymers in light-
emitting diodes,1,2 field-effect transistors,3,4 and plastic
solar cells5,6 have attracted great attention recently. In
polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED), polyfluorenes
(PFs) are promising candidates as blue emitters due to
their high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies
(PLQEs) as solid films, for example, as high as 59% for
as spin-coated poly(9,9-di-n-octyl-2,7-fluorene) (PFO),7
excellent solubility and film-forming ability, and ease
in controlling their properties via facile substitution in
the 9,9-position of the fluorene unit.8-11 However, it was
found to be difficult for PFs to obtain pure and stable
blue light emission due to a presence of undesirable
green emission from the electroluminescence (EL)
device.12-15 Two explanations have been given for the
green emission: one was the keto defect,16-20 and the
other was excimer or aggregate emission.12,16,21-24
Excimer is a delocalized and lower energy excited-
state complex, which is generated by an interaction of
an excited chromophore with a ground-state chromo-
phore,16,25,26 and appears not only in aromatic molecules
but also in polymer systems. Conwell et al.27 found that
cyano-substituted poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (CN-PPV)
exhibited excimer emission due to its small inter-
segmented distance (3.4 Å) resulting from the high
electron affinity of cyano group. Excimer emission was
also found to appear in poly(2,5-di-n-octyloxy-1,4-phen-
ylenevinylene) (DO-PPV) after thermal treatment.28 In
PFs, excimers or aggregates could form by interchain
interactions due to its stiff and planar chain geometry26
and by interactions either between polar end groups29
or due to the appearance of oligomers.30 And several
reports suggested methods to reduce this poor spectral
purity, such as introduction of other chromophores into
main21 or side31-33 chains, cross-linking in film states
via styryl end groups,34 end-capping,13,29 removal of low
molecular weight parts,30 and blending with a polymer
possessing higher glass transition temperatures.35 How-
ever, some of these reports only showed EL spectra
measured at certain applied voltages but did not reveal
whether the emission color would still remain after a
cyclic operation.
Many studies pointed out that the keto defect in
PFs could cause an undesired green emission,36-39
which might originate from an oxidation of 9-mono-
alkylated fluorenes during polymerization,17,40 after
photooxidation16,17 or thermal oxidation18-20 in air,
during thermal deposition of calcium as cathode36
(according to Gamerith et al.,41 the defect so generated
is spatially located close to the cathode and is different
from the “well-described keto-type bulk defect”), and
from operation of a device, especially under atmospheric
conditions.17 However, no direct evidence such as in-
frared data was provided to support the occurrence of
keto defect for the latter two situations. On the other
hand, since heat42 and applied electric field43 may alter
morphology of polymer films and thus their emission
properties, an investigation on their effects resulting
from cyclic device operations is necessary.
Here we investigate reasons that cause variations in
the EL spectrum during continuous operations of PFs-
based devices and find that local segmental alignment
of main chains induced by applied electric field under
relaxation of side chains can induce the formation of
excimers, which contribute to the green component of
the emission. Moreover, the extent of excimer formation
increases with content of polar side chains, and the FI
excimer formation is hard to suppress even after cross-
linking. The structures of the PFs investigated are given
in Chart 1.

Green emission in polyfluorenes (PFs) has been attributed to aggregation or excimer emission, but recently
it was reassigned as an on-chain fluorenone defect. We show here that, in dialkyl-substituted PFs that is
hydrogen-free at the 9′-position of the fluorene, blue emission with very weak green emission is observed
from end-capped polydioctylfluorene (PFO) for both photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectra,
while the low-energy green emission at 507 nm is very pronounced only in uncapped PFO (PFOun). The
facts that there is no detectable infrared absorption at around 1721 cm-1 due to >CdO stretching vibration
in PFOun and no charge-trapping occurring in the light-emitting device from PFOun are in contrast with
those found in the literature-reported copolymers with fluorenone units, which have detectable infrared
absorption at 1721 cm-1 and charge-trapping in devices. We found that this green emission at around 507 nm
originates from the end-group-enhanced aggregation by use of UV-vis absorption, photoexcitation spectra,
and steady-state photoluminescent and electroluminescent spectra. The end-group-enhanced aggregation is
much weaker in other PFs with less-ordered structures.
Introduction
Blue electroluminescent (EL) polymers are very important
for fabrication of full color display, because they not only emit
blue light but also are essential for white light emission1 or other
visible light emissions.2,3 Polyfluorenes (PFs)4-11 are one of the
best blue-light-emitting polymers due to their high photolumi-
nescence (PL) and EL quantum efficiencies and thermal,
chemical, and electrochemical stabilities, as well as their facile
modifications at the 9,9-position of the fluorene unit and the
copolymerization capability of the monomers with many other
monomers. However, the broad green emission is a big problem
for blue color purity and lifetime stability, though a green
emission may be helpful for white light emission.12 The origin
of the green emission is being increasingly debated. It was
assigned to aggregates13 or an excimer,4b,14 but recently it was
reassigned to a fluorenone defect.14a,15-20 The fluorenone
defect14a,21 was first found from oxidation of an unsubstituted
fluorene end-capper (2-bromofluorene). It was then introduced
by oxidation of monosubstituted 9-alkyl fluorene or fluorenone
monomers directly. Thus, this green emission can be suppressed
by using stable end-cappers instead, such as a cross-linkable
styryl unit, anthracene, dihexylfluorene, or silsesquioxane.21,22
End-capping with hole transport moieties can also suppress the
green emission.23 Blending with low-molecular-weight hole
transport materials or other polymers can also suppress the green
emission.5c,24 Further, it was found that this green emission
comes from fluorenone-based excimer emission instead of
localized fluorenone defects,19 and this excimer emission can
be suppressed by a high-molecular-weight polystyrene block
in a terfluorene-b-styrene copolymer.20 There are only a few
reports25,26 that address the uncapped-end-group effect on the
green emissions, but a systemic study on this topic is needed.
In fact, the green emissions in the energy position in the
literature are not clear. In most cases, one could find only a
shoulder at around 510-520 nm for PL spectra in pristine
films,7c,13b,14d a broad peak at around 510 nm,5b or two broad
peaks at 510 and 530 nm18 in EL spectra. Very recently, Sim
et al.19 defined the green emission at 535 nm as g-band, which
comes from fluorenone excimer emission. In the present article,
we found that the existence and characterization of green
emissions depend on the preparation method of the polyfluorenes
and their side-chain structures. We show that the green emission
at around 507 nm in PFO originates from the uncapped-end-
group enhanced aggregation by use of UV-vis absorption,
photoexcitation spectra (PLE), and PL and EL spectra. This end-
group-enhanced aggregation is found to be much weaker in other
PFs with less-ordered structures.

1. Synthesis of Monomers and Polymers. 9,9-Di-(n-octyl)-
2,7-dibromofluorene and 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-bis(trimethyl-
ene boronate) were prepared as described in the previous work.11
9,9-Bis(2′-ethylhexyl)-2,7-dibromofluorene. To a solution of
2,7-dibromofluorene (28.5 g, 88 mmol) in THF (800 mL),
sodium hydride (60%) (8.8 g, 0.22 mmol) was added succes-
sively in several portions at room temperature. The mixture was
heated at 60 °C, and 2-ethylhexyl bromide (43 g, 0.22 mmol)
in THF (200 mL) was added dropwise into the mixture, and
the resulting mixture was refluxed overnight. The mixture was
concentrated and diluted with water slowly, and then extracted
with diethyl ether. After washing with brine, the ether solution
was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the ether was then
removed by evaporation. This crude solid was purified by a
silica chromatography with hexane to give a viscous colorless
liquid (39 g, 81%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3), ä(ppm): 7.50
