Abstract
This report studies the trajectory of spacecraft propelled by the photonic laser propulsion (PLP) system under
the environment of circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP). The PLP system is an innovative technology
proposed by Dr. Bae. With repeated reflections of laser beam, it can generate continuous and tremendous power
by consuming very small energy. In 2011, the application of PLP propelled spacecraft in the Martian mission
is investigated under the two-body-problem assumption. In practical problems, however, the gravity of the Earth
is not negligible. As a result, in this report we study the trajectory under the CRTBP. At beginning, the PLP
system is briefly introduced. Then we prove that the PLP system can be modeled as a force potential, so that
the conventional procedure of analysis to the CRTBP can be applied. Numerical simulations are also provided
to demonstrate the effects of the PLP system.
I. INTRODUCTION
This report studies the trajectory of spacecraft propelled by the photonic laser propulsion (PLP) thrust.
For the past few decades, many researchers have started out to investigate the photon thruster 1 − 4. In
2002, Thomas R. Meyer et. 5 discussed the idea of laser elevator by momentum transfer using an
optical resonator. In 2008, Young K. Bae 6 proposed the concept of the photonic laser propulsion. In
their results, the PLP thrust can by modeled as a continuous, low-thrust, and high specific-impulse (Isp)
engine. However, these researches focused more on the PLP thrust itself, but less on the influences on
the trajectory. Not until 2011 was the application of PLP propelled spacecraft in the Martian mission
investigated under the two-body-problem assumption by Wang and Hsiao7. Wang and Hsiao realized
that there still exist some constraints on the application of PLP thrust7. As a result, this report intends to
investigate more about the influence of the PLP thrust to the spacecraft trajectory. Since interplanetary
missions are ideal targets for this propelling system, this report approaches the problem with the circular,
restricted three-body problem (CR3BP).
On the other hand, much attention has been focused on a continuous, low thrust engine, which has
been proofed its efficiency in the Deep Space 1 mission by NASA 8, and a lunar mission by European
Space Agency(ESA) 9. While several interplanetary missions demonstrated the use of low thrust engine,
such as electric propulsion, as the main propulsion system of the spacecraft. A new idea which use the
power of light has been researched for decades. But for a long time, we didn’t see much applications in
photon thrusters that because the photon thruster is highly inefficient in generating thrust, and this is the
reason the photon thruster has been impractical in most of missions. The PLP, invented by Dr.Young K.
Bae, has become one of the most important inventions in recent years. The most significant difference
between a regular photon thruster and the PLP is that with the intracavity arrangement the momentum
will be efficiently transferred. Thus, the specific thrust can be multiplied by bouncing photons between
high reflectance mirrors, and the PLP can generate much higher Isp.
At first, some facts and theories of the PLP system are briefly reviewed. These facts of the PLP system
suggest that the thrust be continuous and constant. Compared with conventional chemical engine, the
PLP system has very high Isp, but very low thrust force. Then, the equations of motion (EOM) of
the spacecraft in the inertial frame and rotational frame are derived. We prove that the PLP thrust can
be modeled as a pseudo force potential, and the Jacobi integral can be employed to investigate the
spatial restriction to the trajectory. Equations for in-plane and out-of-plane equilibria are also derived.
Numerical simulations are presented to show the validity of the derivations in this research. Example
lunar and martian missions are also presented to demonstrate the efficiency of this type of thrust. The
The other thing to note is that we would like to apply this investigation to a deep space mission,
such as a lunar mission or an interplanetary mission. Thus, the distance between the mother ship and
the mission spacecraft is assumed to be farther than the radius of a geosynchronous orbit. The motion
within the geosynchronous orbit is beyond the discussion in this report, and can be referred to Wang
and Hsiao’s work7.
B. Equations of Motion in Rotational Frame
1) General Form: Assume that the second primary body orbits the first primary body in a circular
trajectory, i.e., the angular rate is constant. Define i, j, and k being the unit vectors of the x-, y-, and
z-direction, respectively. Given ~ω the rotation velocity of the system, the EOM observed in a rotational
system rotating with the second primary can be modeled as
r¨R + 2nk× r˙R + n
2k× (k× r) = −
µ1
r3
1
r1 −
µ2
r3
2
r2 + F Lˆ, (4)
2) Approximation of L: Here we claim that
L = ri − r3 ≈ ri. (5)
As a result, Equations (4) can be approximated by
r¨R + 2nk× r˙R + n
2k× (k× r) = −
µ1
r3
1
r1 −
µ2
r3
2
r2 + F rˆi, i = 1, 2 (6)
On the other hand, r1 and r2 can be expressed as functions of r and R. Since the origin of the frame
locates at the barycenter, we conclude the positions for the first primary and the second primary bodies
are k1R and k2R, respectively, where
k1 = −
m2
m1 +m2
,
k2 =
m1
m1 +m2
.
R = Ri
As a result,
ri = r− kiR, i = 1, 2.
3) Case 1: Orbiting The 1st Primary Object: Let r = Xi+Y j+Zk. Suppose the mother ship orbits
the first primary, so that i = 1 in Eqs. (6). Then, Equations (6) can then be expanded as
X¨ − 2nY˙ = n2X −
µ1
r3
1
(X − k1R)−
µ2
r3

(X − k2R) +

4) Case 2: Orbiting The 2nd Primary Object: Suppose the mother ship orbits the second primary
body. We let i = 2. Other assumptions are the same as those in the previous section. Hence, the EOM
are given by
X¨ − 2nY˙ = n2X −

(X − k1R)−

PLP system. We claim that the right hand side of Eqs. (13) to (15) for i = 1 and Eqs. (16) to (18) for
i = 2 are the gradient of Vi(x, y, z), i = 1, 2.
In future derivations we write Eqs. (13) to (15) or Eqs. (16) to (18) in a brief notation by
r¯′′ − 2Jr¯′ = Vi,r¯, i = 1, 2, (20)
where Vi,r¯ = ∂Vi/∂r¯ and
J =

 0 1 0−1 0 0
0 0 0

 .
Consequently, the Jacobi integral for the ith case can be defined as
Ji(r¯
′, r¯) =
1
2
(x′2 + y′2 + z′2)− Vi(x, y, z). (21)
Equation (21) gives a constraint on the range within which a spacecraft can move. Suppose a spacecraft
has an initial Jacobi integral of Ci,0, then the range within which it can travel is constrained by the
zero-velocity surface embedded in R3. The surface is described by
1
2
r′ · r′ = Ci,0 + Vi(x, y, z) = 0.
If Ci,0 > 0, the motion of the spacecraft has no spatial restriction. If Ci,0 ≤ 0, the spacecraft is only
allowed to move in the region satisfying Vi(x, y, z) = −Ci,0 > 0.
IV. EQUILIBRIUM POINTS
Although the PLP system provides small but continuous thrust, at some point in space, the thrust may
incidentally balance with the gravity, and generate equilibria. Two types of equilibria are considered, the
in-plane and out-of-plane equilibria, respectively. The equilibria can be found by letting all derivative
terms in Eqs. (13) to (18) be zero, given by
0 = x−

Equations. (22) to (24) are equations for Case 1, while Eqs. (25) to (27) are equations for Case 2.
A. In-Plane Equilibria
The in-plane equilibria can be found by assuming z = 0. With this assumption, Equation (24) and
Equation (27) are automatically satisfied. Equations (23) and (26) give two potential solutions y = 0
or 1− (1− µ)/r¯3
1
− µ/r¯3
2
+ F¯ /r¯i = 0. y = 0 may bring the collinear equilibria if they exist, while the
other condition may give the non-collinear equilibria.
B. Out-of-Plane Equilibria
To investigate the out-of-plane equilibria, z 6= 0 is assumed. Therefore, Equations (24) and (27)
respectively give
0 = −
1− µ

. (36)
Let’s consider Case 1 first. Plug Eq. (35) into Eq. (23), and it leads to y = 0. This fact infers that
potential out-of-plane equilibria occurs only in the xz-plane. Plug Eq. (35) into Eq. (22), and it yields
x+
µ
r¯3
2
= 0, (37)
where r¯1 =
√
(x+ µ)2 + z2 and r¯2 =
√
(x+ µ− 1)2 + z2. Solving Eqs. (35) and (37) gives the a
sequence of out-of-plane-equilibria for Case 1.
Similarly, we obtain
x−
1− µ
r¯3
1
= 0, (38)
by plugging Eq. (36) into Eq. (25) for Case 2. Solving Eqs. (36) and (38) gives the a sequence of
out-of-plane-equilibria for Case 2.

Simulations are provided in Figs. 4 to 5. Figure 4 simulates the trajectory of lunar mission with
an arbitrarily given initial condition in the rotational frame, and computes the radius of the mission
spacecraft. It is obvious that the spacecraft intercepts the lunar orbit at τ = 0.64, equivalent to 3.8 days.
Figure 5 simulates the trajectory of martian mission with an arbitrarily given initial condition in the
rotational frame, and computes the radius of the mission spacecraft. It is obvious that the spacecraft
intercepts the martian orbit at τ = 0.0586, equivalent to 21.4 days. Therefore, the PLP is a very efficient
way to propel a spacecraft.

VI. CONCLUSION
This report studies the trajectory of spacecraft propelled by photonic laser propulsion (PLP) under
the circular, restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) assumption. At first, some facts and theories of the
PLP system are briefly reviewed. These facts of the PLP system suggest that the thrust be continuous
and constant. Compared with conventional chemical engine, the PLP system has very high Isp, but
very low thrust force. Then, the equations of motion (EOM) of the spacecraft in the inertial frame and
rotational frame are derived. We prove that the PLP thrust can be modeled as a pseudo force potential,
and the Jacobi integral can be employed to investigate the spatial restriction to the trajectory. Equations
for in-plane and out-of-plane equilibria are also derived. We analytically prove that the five equilibria
still exist in this system, regardless of the magnitude of the PLP force. Similar to the Lagrange points
in the conventional CR3BP, there are three collinear equilibria that locate in the intervals x < −µ,
−µ < x < 1 − µ, and x > 1 − µ, respectively. There are two planar, non-collinear equilibria. A
sequences of out-of-plane equilibria exist on the xz-plane. Numerical simulations are presented to show
the validity of the derivations in this research. Example lunar and martian missions are also presented to
demonstrate the efficiency of this type of thrust. The results obtained in this report are directly applicable
to the usage of the PLP thrust in the future, and potentially helpful to various space missions, including
interplanetary traveling.

PHOTONIC LASER PROPULSION
For most conventional spacecraft, they burn chemical propellent to generate the thrust. If we want
to execute an interplanetary mission, a lot of fuel should be carried onboard and this increases the
weight of the spacecraft. The concept of using laser to provide the thrust force has been discussed by
many scientists. Most of them failed due to high inefficiency when laser generates thrust. Photonic
Propulsion transfers the momentum of photons to a spacecraft and emits them. In this process,
photons are the propellent. Although photons have the largest specific impulse (Isp = 3.06×107s),
they have the smallest thrust-to-power ratio (T/P = 3.34× 10−9 N/W) 6.
Dr.Young K. Bae proposed a concept that an active resonant optical cavity is formed between two
space platforms. In this design, the photon thrust F produced on each mirror is given by 6
F =
E
ct
, (1)
where E is the energy of each photon, c is the light speed, t is the interaction time.
Since E/t = P , where P is the laser output power through the output mirror, we get F = P/c.
Because the laser is bounced back and forth between highly reflectance mirrors, the thrust will given
by
F =
2PRmS
c

whereRm is the mirror reflectance, and S is the apparent photon thrust amplification factor, defined
as the ratio of the intracavity laser power to the extracavity laser power P . S is approximated by

Assume that the first primary body has mass ofm1, the second body has mass ofm2, the mother
ship has mass ofmm, and the mission spacecraft has mass ofmsc. A reasonable assumption is that
m1 > m2,mm ≈ 0 andmsc ≈ 0. Consider a coordinate that places at the barycenter of the system.
Let R be the position vector pointing from the first primary to the second primary. Let r and L be
the position vector of the mission spacecraft from the origin and the mother ship, respectively. Let
r1 and r2 be the position vectors pointing to the mission spacecraft from the first and the second
primary bodies, respectively. Let r3 be the position vector pointing to the mother ship from the
center of the orbited body. In this case, it can be the first or the second primary.
Since the masses of the mother ship and the mission spacecraft are assumed to be zero, the
second primary orbits the first primary under the condition of the two-body problem. According to
the Newton’s gravitation law and Newton’s second law of motion, the equations of motion (EOM)
of the second primary body and the mission spacecraft are given by

smaller the angle. As a result, it is also reasonable to approximate Lˆ by Lˆ ≈ rˆi, and consequently,
L ≈ ri. Since the influence of r3 is very small, we do not care the trajectory of the mother ship
very much, as long as it is bounded and around a low orbit. As a result, Equations (8) can be
approximated by
r¨R + 2nk× r˙R + n2k× (k× r) = −µ1
r31
r1 − µ2
r32
r2 + F rˆi, i = 1, 2 (10)
On the other hand, r1 and r2 can be expressed as functions of r and R. Since the origin of
the frame locates at the barycenter, we conclude the positions for the first primary and the second
primary bodies are k1R and k2R, respectively, where
k1 = − m2
m1 +m2

k2 =

As a result,
ri = r− kiR, i = 1, 2.
Case 1: Orbiting The 1st Primary Object Let r = Xi + Y j + Zk. Suppose the mother ship
orbits the first primary, so that i = 1 in Eqs. (10). Then,
r1 = r− k1R
= (X − k1R)i+ Y j+ Zk,
r2 = r− k2R
= (X − k2R)i+ Y j+ Zk,
Equations (10) can then be expanded as

JACOBI INTEGRAL
It is obvious to show that ∇× F¯ = 0 where ∇ = ∂/∂r¯ = ∂/∂xi + ∂/∂yj + ∂/∂zk, implying
that F¯ is conservative and can be represented as a force potential. Let
Vi(x, y, z) =
1
2
(x2 + y2) +
1− µ
r¯1
+
µ
r¯2
+ F¯ ri (23)
= Uc + Up,
where Uc = (x2 + y2)/2 + (1 − µ)/r¯1 + µ/r¯2 is the conventional force potential commonly
used in the circular restricted three-body problem10,11, and Up = F¯ ri is the pseudo force potential
generated by the PLP system. We claim that the right hand side of Eqs. (17) to (19) for i = 1 and
Eqs. (20) to (22) for i = 2 are the gradient of Vi(x, y, z), i = 1, 2.
Proof:
Since Uc is the conventional force potential commonly used in the circular restricted three-body
problem, it is obvious that
∂Uc
∂r¯
= xi+ yj− 1− µ
r¯31
r¯1 − µ

Then, consider the gradient of Up.

As a result,

In future derivations we write Eqs. (17) to (19) or Eqs. (20) to (22) in a brief notation by
r¯′′ − 2Jr¯′ = Vi,r¯, i = 1, 2, (25)
where Vi,r¯ = ∂Vi/∂r¯ and
J =
 0 1 0−1 0 0
0 0 0
 .
Consequently, the Jacobi integral for the ith case can be defined as
Ji(r¯
′, r¯) =
1
2
(x′2 + y′2 + z′2)− Vi(x, y, z). (26)

Collinear Equilibria Assume y = 0, leading to
r¯ = |x|,
r¯1 = |x+ µ|,
r¯2 = |x+ µ− 1|.
Equations (27) and (30) become
0 = x− sgn(x+ µ)
[
1− µ
(x+ µ)2
+ F¯
]
− sgn(x+ µ− 1) µ
(x+ µ− 1)2 if i = 1, (33)
0 = x− sgn(x+ µ) 1− µ
(x+ µ)2
− sgn(x+ µ− 1)
[
µ
(x+ µ− 1)2 + F¯
]
if i = 2, (34)
where sgn(·) is the sign function. It returns 1 if the variable is positive, and -1 if the variable is
negative.
Solutions to Eqs. (33) and (34) depend on the values of µ and F¯ . The analytically solutions may
be difficult to obtain. However, we can prove that three solutions exist in the intervals x > 1 − µ,
−µ < x < 1− µ, and x < −µ for both cases. The proof is provided in Appendix A.
Non-collinear Equilibria To find non-collinear equilibria, we assume y ̸= 0. This condition
gives
1− 1− µ
r¯31
− µ
r¯32
+
F¯
r¯i
= 0, (35)
Plugging Eq. (35) into Eq. (27) with i = 1 and Eq. (30) with i = 2 yields
0 = (1− µ)
(
− 1
r¯31
+
1
r¯32
)
+
F¯
r¯1
, (36)
0 = µ
(
1
r¯31
− 1
r¯32
)
+
F¯
r¯2
. (37)
We first consider Case 1, which satisfies by Eqs. (35) and (36). Subtracting Eq. (36) from Eq. (35)
yields
1− 1
r¯32
= 0.
Thus, r¯2 = 1, regardless of F¯ and µ. Substitute r¯2 = 1 back to Eq. (36), and we obtain
(1− µ)(r¯31 − 1) + F¯ r¯21 = 0, (38)
given r¯1 ̸= 0. We claim that r¯1 = r¯1(F¯ , µ) exists. The proof is provided in Appendix B. The
result shows that at least one in-plane, non-collinear equilibrium point exist. However, the force
distribution is symmetric about the x-axis. Therefore, it is apparent that the equilibrium point must
be symmetric, too. As a result, two in-plane, non-collinear equilibria exist. Their locations are
reflective on the x-axis.

Two potential applications are presented, the lunar mission and the martian mission. In the two
scenarios the mother ship is assumed to orbit the Earth, and the mission spacecraft is assumed to
depart from the mother ship. We would like to show properties and efficiency of the PLP thrust. The
lunar mission is an application of Case 1, since the Earth is the first primary object. The martian
mission is the an application of Case 1, since the Earth is the first primary object.
The gravitational parameters for the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon are µs = 1.327×1011 km3/s2,
µe = 3.986 × 105 km3/s2, and µm = 4902.8 km3/s2, respectively12. The radius of lunar orbit is

Figure 9. An example of zero-velocity contour in the martian mission using PLP system
of the PLP system are briefly reviewed. These facts of the PLP system suggest that the thrust be
continuous and constant. Compared with conventional chemical engine, the PLP system has very
high Isp, but very low thrust force. Then, the equations of motion (EOM) of the spacecraft in the
inertial frame and rotational frame are derived. We prove that the PLP thrust can be modeled as a
pseudo force potential, and the Jacobi integral can be employed to investigate the spatial restriction
to the trajectory. Equations for in-plane and out-of-plane equilibria are also derived. We analytically
prove that the five equilibria still exist in this system, regardless of the magnitude of the PLP force.

Interval 2: −µ < x < 1− µ
For case 1, we take f1(x) = 0 into consideration. In this interval, x+ µ > 0 and x+ µ− 1 < 0,
yielding
f1(x) = x− 1− µ
(x+ µ)2
+ F¯ +
µ
(x+ µ− 1)2 ,
Let a = −µ + ϵ and b = 1 − µ − ϵ, where ϵ > 0 and ϵ ≪ 1. It is obvious that a → −µ and
b→ (1− µ), when ϵ→ 0. Then,
f1(a) = (−µ+ ϵ)− 1− µ
ϵ2
+ F¯ +
µ
(ϵ− 1)2
= Ca − 1− µ
ϵ2
,
where Ca = −µ+ ϵ+ F¯ + µ/(ϵ− 1)2. Given ϵ≪ 1, (1− µ)/ϵ2 grows very large and dominates
the value of the function. Hence, we conclude f(a) < 0.
On the other hand,
f1(b) = (1− µ− ϵ)− 1− µ
(1− ϵ)2 + F¯ +
µ
(−ϵ)2
= Cb +
µ
ϵ2
,
where Cb = (1−µ−ϵ)−(1−µ)/(1−ϵ)2+ F¯ . Given ϵ≪ 1, µ/ϵ2 grows very large and dominates
the value of the function. Hence, we conclude f(b) > 0.
As a result, f1(a)f1(b) < 0 and there must exists at least one solution in the interval of −µ <
x < 1 − µ for case 1. The same method can be applied to f2(x), and it can shown that there must
exists at least one solution in the interval of −µ < x < 1− µ for case 2.
Interval 3: x < −µ
In this interval, x+ µ− 1 < 0 and x+ µ < 0. Hence,
f1(x) = f2(x) = f(x) = x+
1− µ
(x+ µ)2
+
µ
(x+ µ− 1)2 + F¯ ,
Let a = −µ− ϵ, b = −µ− 1/ϵ, where ϵ > 0 and ϵ≪ 1. It is obvious that a→ −µ and b→ −∞,
when ϵ→ 0. Then,
f(a) = −µ− ϵ+ 1− µ
(−ϵ)2 +
µ
(−ϵ− 1)2 + F¯
= Ca +
1− µ
ϵ2
,
where Ca = −µ− ϵ+ µ/(1 + ϵ)2 + F¯ . Given ϵ≪ 1, (1− µ)/ϵ2 grows very large and dominates
the value of the function. Hence, we conclude f(a) > 0.
