2important, because they offer several advantages,
i.e. high biodegradation efficiency, smaller
footprint, and less sludge production [3].
Recent literature shows that MBR can be
effective in removing these emerging
contaminants. During the last three years
research results were published in this particular
area, reflecting the growing number of MBR
applications for treatment of specific chemical
compounds, such as pharmaceuticals, fragrances
and endocrine disrupting compounds. However,
various aspects of practical applications still
received little or no attention to date [4,5] and
the application of the MBR in treatment of
pharmaceutical wastewater is still in its infancy.
While there are many similarities in the design
parameters for municipal plants, industrial plants
show considerable variations in design, control
and operational performance.
This paper presents the results of a pilot-scale
MBR performance used in the treatment of
pharmaceutical wastewater in Southern Taiwan
Science Park (STSP).
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Experimental setup and operation
Fig. 1 shows the MBR plant constructed to
treat wastewater from a pharmaceutical company.
The company is located at Southern Taiwan
Science Park (STSP). Regulation requires the
COD of the wastewater should be reduced to
below 450 mg/L in order to be discharged into a
tertiary treatment plant in the STSP
Administration which has an effluent COD limit
of 50 mg/L.
The system consisted of two tanks with a total
volume of 20 m3. The first tank is a biological
tank (10 m3) and the second tank has a dual
function of biological reaction with solid-liquid
separation. The hollow fibre membrane used in
this plant was manufactured by MOTIMO
Company in China. Table 1 shows the
characteristics of the membrane. The hollow
fiber membrane was immersed in the membrane
tank, where the air was supplied at the bottom of
the membrane units to supply of oxygen for
biological treatment and to create a turbulence
which helps reduce membrane fouling.
The membranes were operated at an
intermediate suction and were backwashed
periodically using permeate. Prior to day 40 of
operation, several operating modes including the
suction-relaxation and coarse bubble aeration
duration were evaluated with the aim of reducing
the fouling of membranes. On day 41, the
operation mode was fixed as follow: during the
continuous operation mode, the suction pump
was stopped for 30 seconds after 4 minutes of
filtration to allow membrane relaxation. Two
modules of membrane were employed in the
second tank to alternatively accommodate the
pumping and relaxation mode exchange
operating mode. For each membrane, 54 minutes
of membrane operation (12 cycles of
suction-relaxation) was followed by 6 minutes of
backwash by permeate.
After 30 days of seeding and start-up, the MBR
plant was monitored continuously for 140 days.
The HRT of the aerobic tank and MBR tank were
set at the same value of 24 hours. The
re-circulation rate of the mixed liquor was set at
500% of the average influent flow rate.
2.2 Wastewater characteristics
The influent to the MBR system consisted of
real pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewater
and septic tank effluent. The plant has
intermittent and fluctuating wastewater flow with
variable wastewater composition depending on
the production regime. The characteristics of the
wastewater are indicated in Table 2.
2.3 Control, analysis and monitoring
DO, pH, ORP, temperature and flow rates were
recorded daily using the in-line controllers.
Dissolved oxygen (DO) was monitored with a
DO analyzer and maintained higher than 3.0
mg/L in the aerobic and membrane tanks. The
influent and effluent of each tank were sampled
two to three times per week. The analysis
including chemical oxygen demand (COD),
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), mixed
liquid suspended solids (MLSS), mixed liquid
volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) and turbidity
were performed in accordance with the standard
methods (APHA, 1993) and the corresponding
instrument instruction manuals. The mixed liquor
viscosity was measured by a TVC-5 type
viscometer (Toki Sangyo Co., Ltd., Japan)
The surface morphologies of the nascent and
fouled membranes were characterized by
scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy
dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX) with a Hitachi
S-3000 system. The samples were fixed with
4.0% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer at
pH 7.2 and dehydrated with ethanol, gold-coated
by a sputter and observed in SEM.

4Besides, the effluent SDI value is between 4 to
6 over the period of operation. It revealed that
further treatment should be adopted if the
effluent is to be used as the feed water to a RO
system for recycling purposes. Otherwise, a
membrane with a smaller pore size such as NF
could be employed to improve the SDI index.
Fig. 5 illustrates the variations of TMP and
flux during the monitoring period. The
membrane module was withdrawn for cleaning
on days 43 and 92 to remove clogging. Chemical
cleaning was carried out on day 102 by
inside-out type washing (as shown in Figure 5).
It was found that the clogging occured
periodically within about 40 days. It can be seen
that there was an abrupt raise of TMP from 10 to
38 kPa prior to the second manual cleaning and
the same phenomena was observed before the
first manual cleaning. The TMP varied from 9 to
55 kPa with the flux change from 16-64 Lm-2h-1.
However, the TMP kept within a range of 10-25
kPa over most of the period of operation. It
demonstrated that less power consumption is
needed for the immersed membrane system than
for the pressure driven type of membrane.
Some studies reported that fouling was
independent of MLSS concentration until a very
high value was reached. Yamamoto et al. [6]
reported that the critical MLSS concentration
was about 30–40 g/L, but it varied with operating
conditions. Ross et al. [7] also found that a
dramatic increase in membrane fouling, i.e., a
sharp decrease in permeate flux, occurred after a
stable performance of up to 40 g/L of MLSS
concentration. Based on the field observations in
this study, a cake layer formed around the
membrane fibres and seemed to contribute to the
main part of membrane fouling even where the
range of MLSS concentration investigated here
was lower than the critical values reported in
literature [6,7].

Fig. 6 shows the variation in viscosity during
the period of operation. Similar to the trend
observed with MLSS, three stages of variation in
viscosity was observed. In the initial stage (up to
day 50), the viscosity was low in a range between
8–13 mPa s, followed by a sharp increase from
day 50 to day 69, and finally achieving the higher
viscosity in the range of 64 - 79 mPa s.
The relationship between viscosity and MLSS
is shown in Fig. 7. The result showed that the
mixed liquor viscosity increased logarithmically
as the MLSS concentration increased. It indicates
a decreasing influence of higher solid
concentrations on viscosity.
Previous results often demonstrated the plot of
viscosity versus suspended solids with power or
exponential laws, resulting in curves having
upward concavity [8,9]. According to Sanin [10],
exponential pattern can explain the stronger
non-Newtonian behavior of the sludge with
increasing solid concentration.
The exponential evolution of the viscosity with
MLSS concentration for MBR systems was also
observed others [11,12]. Trussell et al. [11]
reported the relationship followed an exponential
law at different MCRT (mean cell retention time)
conditions. Pollice et al. [12] interpreted the plot
of viscosity versus suspended solids with
exponential laws but had a downward concavity
similar to our work.
In fact, the dependence of viscosity with MLSS
could be related to the sludge composition, the
floc size and shape, the nature of the interactions
between particles and to the quantity of bound
water. The other parameters such as extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS) and soluble
microbial products (SMP) could also affect the
variation of viscosity [8-10].
