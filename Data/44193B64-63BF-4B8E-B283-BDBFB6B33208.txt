The 3 dB bandwidth extends from 1.27 GHz to 5.31 GHz. The 
maximum differential gain is 10.13 dB. Measured at 3 GHz, P1dB 
and IIP3 are -10 dBm and 0 dBm, respectively. The LNA core 
circuit dissipates 7.32 mW from 1.8 V power supply.  
A low-power quadrature frequency tripler using sub-harmonic 
mixing is designed for wideband LO signal generation. The 
frequency tripler consumes 11.5mW from 1.8V supply voltage. The 
fundamental harmonic rejection ratio (HRR1) achieves more than 
35 dB, and the conversion gain achieves -4.2 dB at output frequency 
of 4.5 GHz.  
A frequency-to-voltage converter (FVC) is designed for directly 
converting an RF input signal to a DC output voltage over a wide 
microwave frequency range. The proposed circuit consists of a 4-
stage limiting amplifier (LA) for frequency-to-power converter 
(FPC) and a power detector for power-to-voltage conversion. 
Consequently, the circuit converts the signal frequency of 1-5 GHz 
to the measured DC voltage of 0.22-1.42 V without the influence of 
the input power level from -7 to +5 dBm. With 1.8 V supply 
voltage, the dc power consumption varies from 16.5 to 17.8 mW, 
depending on the input frequency.  
A flat wideband delay circuit is designed using the 2nd-order form 
of the Pade approximant for bandwidth extension. The measured 
result shows that the circuit achieves a delay time of 49 psec in the 
GHz frequency range. The power consumption of the core circuit is 
7.88 mW from 1.8 V supply voltage.  
A high input power range phase shifter is designed and fabricated 
for phase array transmitter application. With proposed variable gain 
amplifier in I/Q vector combination based phase shifter, the 
performance of output signal has been improved. From measured 
results, the gain variation and phase distortion versus input power of 
output signal are smaller than 1.5 dB and ±2 °, respectively. The 
minimum DC consumption of core circuit is 15.46 mW from 1.8 V 
supply voltage.

2.1 Introduction 
Fig. 2-1 shows the block diagram of direct down-conversion receiver, which 
includes a wideband low-noise amplifier (LNA), a down-conversion mixer, a 
frequency tripler, and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The design challenge in 
both signal path and signal source is the wide operating frequency range. In signal 
path, a wideband, high linearity balun LNA is proposed. Otherwise, the cascade of 
VCO and frequency tripler with switch control is proposed in signal source design. 
This solution will relax the frequency tuning range design of VCO. In this chapter, the 
design and measurement result of wideband LNA will be presented in Section 2.2 and 
Section 2.3, respectively. And the design and measurement result of frequency tripler 
will be given in Section 2.4 and Section 2.5, respectively. Finally, a conclusion is 
shown in Section 2.6.

The second technique for gain enhancement is capacitance cross-coupling (CCC) 
realized by M3, M4, C3, and C4. The small signal model is shown in Fig. 2-3(a). And 
the common-gate (CG) conFiguration is also shown in Fig. 2-3(b) for comparison. Let 
the sizes of M3 and M4 be identical. The voltage gain of CCC and CG could be

From Eq. (1) and (2), the voltage gain ratio between CCC and CG are two. In other 
word, the CCC topology is more advantageous than the CG topology in gain/power 
efficiency. The performance of second-order distortion and noise are also improved by 
the CCC topology. More details can be found in [3].

The differential gain is shown in Fig. 2-5. The maximum differential gain is 
10.17 dB at 3.08 GHz, and the 3 dB bandwidth is from 1.27 GHz to 5.31 GHz. The 
gain and phase balance of proposed wideband balun LNA are shown in Fig. 2-6 and 
Fig. 2-7, respectively. The gain difference is smaller than ±1.5 dB from DC to 6 GHz. 
The phase balance is below ±12 degree at operation frequency band. Fig. 2-8 shows 
the input and output matching of proposed wideband balun LNA.  
The input return loss is below -10 dB from 1.74 GHz to 5.2 GHz and the output 
return loss is below -10 dB from 3.34 GHz to 6.5 GHz. The wideband linearity test 
result includes P1dB and IIP3 are both shown in Fig. 2-9. The minimum P1dB is -10.67 
dBm at 4 GHz. The frequency offset for IIP3 setup is 1.0 MHz, and the minimum IIP3 
is -0.57 dBm when input frequency is 2 GHz. Fig. 2-10 shows the measured noise 
Figure versus operating frequency. The noise Figure is below 5.5 dB from 2.1 GHz to 
4.05 GHz, and the minimum value is 5.04 dB at 3.17 GHz. The performance 
summary and comparison is shown in Table 2-1.

doubler. It generates the output current at to drive the top source-coupled differential 
pair (M3, M4), which works as the switching stage of the mixer. This mixer produces 
the third-order harmonic by frequency up-conversion of current commutation. 
Circuit operation relies on the second-order nonlinearity in both transistor pairs. To 
maximize the efficiency of frequency conversion, each transistor gate port is biased 
for the maximum voltage derivative of device transconductance. 
The efficiency of frequency conversion also relies on the phase relationship of the 
two input signals to the upper and lower differential pairs. It is found the phase 
difference needs to be ±90 degrees out of phase, or a quadrature pair. 
As shown in Fig. 2-13, the cancellation circuit is implemented in the differential 
form. It consists of a unit current gain buffer (M5 and M9) and a vector tuner (M7, 8 
and M11, 12). Transistors (M6 and M10) work as current sources to provide appropriate 
biasing current to the gain buffer. The gain buffer isolates the tripler and vector tuner 
to reduce the loading effect on the tripler core due to the parasitic capacitance from 
the vector tuners. 
The output fundamental component of icore is due to the direct feed-through of the 
input signal at the gate port of M4. The cancellation circuit generates cancellation 
current Ivt of 180 degrees out of phase to null out that component. Ivt  comes from the 
vector combination of the input I and Q signals, which magnitudes are adjusted by 
M11 and M12, respectively, to produce the required phase and magnitude.

2.6 Conclusion 
A wideband and high linearity balun LNA in 0.18-μm CMOS technology is 
designed and implemented in this work. With proposed topology, the function of 
wideband matching and wideband balun has been achieved. From measurement result, 
the 3-dB band is from 1.27 GHz to 5.31 GHz, and the input return loss is better than 
10 dB from 1.74 GHz to 5.2 GHz. This circuit is suitable for wideband 
communication system application. 
The frequency tripler with fundamental cancelling was verified to has 35 dB 
HRR1 which is impressive for frequency multiplier circuit design. The power 
consumption is another merit compared to other published works. Therefore, this 
frequency tripler features quadrature signal generation, which is very useful in 
modern RF transceivers associated with quadrature modulation.

Fig. 3-4. The circuit schematic of the power detector. 
The circuit block diagram of proposed RFVC is shown in Fig. 3-2. The input signal 
vRF is a sinusoidal waveform at the frequency ωo with amplitude of ARF. The dc output 
voltage VDC is required to be proportional to ωo, and ideally irrelevant to ARF. The 
circuit is composed of two blocks, an N-stage LA for frequency to power converter, 
and a power detector for power to DC voltage converter. 
Essentially the signal frequency can be characterized by utilizing the roll-off 
response above the pole frequency of a simple-pole circuit. Fig. 3-3 shows a 
common-source (CS) amplifier for the purpose. It gives a low-pass response with the 
corner frequency (ωc) determined by the load resistance (Rd) and capacitance at the

3.3 Measurement Results of RFVC  
The proposed FVC is designed and fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The 
chip size includes pads for testing is 860 μm x 500 μm. The die photo is shown in Fig. 
3-5. 
The power dissipation of with input signal at 1 GHz and 5 GHz are 19.4mW and 
17.43mW, respectively. Fig. 3-6 shows the output voltage versus input frequency 
under different input power conditions. With input signal from 1- 5 GHz, the output 
DC voltage range is from 0.2 V to 1.4 V. Owing to the operating mechanism of LA is 
introduced in RFPC design, the values of output DC voltage are extremely closely. 
The output voltage versus input power with different frequencies of input signal is 
shown in Fig. 3-7. From measurement result, the variation of output DC voltage under 
same frequency is smaller than 0.046 mV. The performance summary of proposed

Wideband Delay Circuit for Time Array System 
 
4.1 Introduction 
In the modern communication system, the trend will aim to beam-forming 
system integration. The main methods of implementation are time array and phase 
array. The most important circuit block of time array system is time delay circuit, and 
the block diagram is shown in Fig. 4-1. The design goals of this wideband time delay 
circuit are the extension of operating bandwidth and reduction of circuit area. 
This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 4-2, the circuit design is described. 
The measurement results are summarized in Section 4-3. Finally, a conclusion is 
given in Section 4-4.

Fig. 4-3. The schematic of proposed wideband delay circuit. 
 
The implementation of the 2nd-order transfer function in a single stage is chosen in 
this work. Fig. 4-3 shows the schematic of the proposed wideband delay circuit. This 
circuit is composed of a differential pair M1-M2, two common-gate cascode stages 
M3-M6 and two common gate amplifiers M7-M8. Actually the circuit implementation is 
considered by rewriting the 2nd-order all-pass transfer function in two terms as

The first term is unit gain, and the second term represents a transfer function of a 
band-pass filter. In the proposed circuit, M1 and M2 give a constant gain as the first term, 
and the path through M3-M6 yields to the band-pass response. The signals of two paths 
are summed up at the drain of M1-M2 in the current domain. 
When the summed up current runs through the load, the intrinsic capacitor from 
the transistors and the loading effect from the next stage give an extra low-pass 
response to the transfer function. This non-ideal effect will introduce extra group 
delay and delay dispersion to the entire circuit performance. Even though the 
inductance peaking technique used in [10] can compensate for delay dispersion, the 
group delay tends to be sensitive to the resulted overshooting.  
In order to alleviate the issue, two common-gate transistors M7-M8 are added as a 
buffer stage, rather than as the inductive loading. The output impedance can also 
introduce inductance peaking by adding resistor Rb on the gate side of M7 and M8. 
This inductance peaking introduces a farther zero compare to that in [10], yielding to 
a larger bandwidth of group delay. The summed current finally goes through M7-M8 to 
the load RL, providing unit gain buffering of all-pass response. Rc at the input is for 
input matching purpose.

The proposed wideband time-delay circuit is designed and fabricated in 0.18 μm 
CMOS technology. Both input and output ports are differential. Fig. 4-4 shows the die 
micrograph. The core circuit occupies the area of 320×160μm2. The total chip size is 
520×820 μm2. The DC power consumption of core circuit and buffer are 7.88 mW 
and 8.91 mW from 1.8 V power supply, respectively. 
The measurement result of S-parameter is shown in Fig. 4-5. The input and output 
matching return loss are better than 10 dB up to 10 GHz. The loss of proposed 
time-delay circuit at 1 GHz and 5 GHz are 5.72 dB and 8.93 dB, respectively. Due to 
the output buffer of a source follower, the gain level of the entire circuit becomes less 
than 0 dB. This can be recovered in a fully integrated circuit design. Fig. 4-6 shows 
the measured group delay. At low frequencies, it appears to be flat around 45 psec. 
The group delay becomes 37.2 psec at 5 GHz. The linearity performance of the 
measured P1dB versus input frequency is shown in Fig. 3-7. The worst P1dB is -4.72 
dBm at 1 GHz. Since the gain level drops as frequency increases, P1dB increases to be 
-4 dBm at 5 GHz.

High Input Power Range Phase Shifter for Transmitter Array 
Application 
 
Fig. 5-1. Block diagram of RF-path shifter transmitter array 
 
5.1 Introduction 
The other method for beam-forming implementation is phase array system, and 
the key component is the phase shifter. The block diagram of RF-path shifting phase 
array transmitter is shown in Fig. 5-1.  
In phase shifter design, the technique of I/Q vector combination is widely used in 
the active scheme. The desired output signal phase can be synthesized by summing a 
pair of quadrature I and Q input signals, each with an appropriate magnitude. By 
using two of the four input phases of 0o, 90o, 180o, and 270o, a full range of 
360-degree output phase can be achieved. The scheme therefore requires variable gain 
amplifiers (VGAs) to adjust the magnitude of the I/Q signals to the desired ratio. 
The design issue arises from VGA linearity. Although the phase shifting resolution 
is loose, the shifted phase shall remain constant irrelevant to the signal content. 
Consider the complicated modulation technique in modern digital communications 
normally with high signal peak-to-average ratio (PAR). If the VGA causes nonlinear 
amplitude distortion, the output phase of the shifter varies along with the modulated 
signal envelope. The output signal then suffers from the error vector magnitude (EVM) 
degradation, similar to the AM-to-PM distortion issue in power amplifier design.  
The typical implementation of VGA calls for the conFiguration of a differential 
amplifier, which voltage gain is controlled by the device transconductance, or, in turn, 
the bias current [11], [12]. Given a bias current setting, the transconductance only 
remains constant within a limited range of the input signal swing. Since the modulated 
signal envelope variation could be more than 10 dB, it is critical to permit a large 
 24
5.2 Circuit Design 
The commonly used VGA design in a phase shifter with I/Q vector combination 
technique is as shown in Fig. 5-2 [11], [12]. Signal appears in the differential format. 
The phase shifter consists of four differential amplifiers in a group of two. Each group 
amplifies the I or Q signal to the specified output level. Essentially the two input 
signals in each group are simply phase inversed to each other, yielding to summation 
or subtraction. Only one signal in each group is amplified and summed up at the 
output in the current domain. Gain control and input signal selection are realized by 
tuning the dc bias current to the specified transconductance. By doing so, the output 
phase covers the full range of 360 degrees. 
 
Fig. 5-2 Block diagram of a conventional I/Q vector combiner phase shifter. 
 
Fig. 5-3 Phase distortion versus input swing of commonly used VGA 
The issues of the VGA circuit configuration are twofold. One is the 
transconductance variation along with the input signal swing. If the input swing 
becomes large, device nonlinearity causes the effective dc bias to change. Thus the 
amplifier gain changes correspondingly. The other is the gain variation due to gain 
tuning in another amplifier pair. In deep submicron devices, the device 
transconductance varies notably at different VDS bias even if the bias current is fixed. 
In this conFiguration, the dc voltage of Vop and Von actually changes if the bias 
current changes in one transistor pair. The gain level of a transistor pair therefore is 
affected by gain tuning in another pair. 
The reason of narrow input power range of commonly used VGA design is that the 
 26
transconductance is also fixed, namely, irrelevant to the input voltage swing. 
The output phase resolution relies on the gain control to I and Q signals, and in 
turn on the device size ratio among gain cells.  
This concept is similar to the programmable gain amplifier (PGA) in [13]. Fig. 5-5 
shows the magnitude ratio of I/Q signals to synthesize the phase resolution of 22.5° 
with equal magnitudes. Calculated by arctangent function, the integral I/Q ratio of 0°, 
22.5°, 45°, 67.5°, and 90° are 13/0, 12/5, 9/9, 5/12, and 0/13, respectively. The device 
sizes in a set of gain cells need to be chosen properly. Although binary weighting 
allows high resolution [6], the sizes of x1, x3, x4, x5 are chosen in this work for 
minimum hardware implementation. The congenital theoretical phase error and gain 
variation are 0.12° and 0.092 dB, respectively.  
 By using proposed schematic of VGA in I/Q vectors combination based phase 
shifter design, the mechanism of gain tuning only depends on the accuracy of device 
ratio. The bias condition of each gain cell is fixed in ON state. This is the maximum 
difference between commonly used VGA and proposed VGA. Based on proposed 
VGA, the sensitivity of VDS could be reduced. The phase distortion and gain variation 
of phase shifter will be improved in wide input power range. 
5.2.2 Quadrature Phase Generator and Output Buffers 
The phase shifter requires quadrature phase input signals. In this design, an RC 
poly-phase filter (PPF) is adopted to convert a differential input for the purpose. A 
100-Ω resistor is also placed in shunt to the input for impedance matching. As such, 
the PPF introduces significant signal loss. The simulated result shows that the voltage 
loss of the PPF is 5.75 dB at 3.5 GHz. This voltage loss is subtracted from 
measurement data in phase shifter gain calculations. 
At the phase shifter output, a source follower stage is included as an output buffer 
for impedance matching for measurement. The voltage loss of the output buffer is 7.5 
dB at 3.5 GHz.

Chapter 6 Conclusions and Future Works 
 
6.1 Conclusions 
In this report, the circuit blocks for wideband frequency operation and 
beam-forming system are designed and implemented. From the measurement result, 
the design targets have been achieved.  
A 1.27-5.31 GHz wideband, high linearity balun LNA is suitable for the first 
stage design in receiver chain, and the 3-5.7 GHz frequency tripler is also suitable for 
wideband LO source generator.  
Otherwise, for FSK demodulation requirement, a direct radio-frequency to DC 
voltage converter is developed and implemented. The wideband LO signal source is 
not necessary demand in this FSK demodulator, so the design complexity, and chip 
size will has a significant reduction. 
For beam-forming system design, the 3 dB bandwidth of proposed wideband 
delay circuit is extended to 4.38 GHz without any inductor peaking which will reduce 
silicon area. This circuit has a great potential for fully time array system integration. 
In phase shifter design, the wide input dynamic range requirement is solved by 
proposed method. This circuit is also suitable to phase array transmitter integration. 
These works are also presented in Mater Theses [14], [15] of National Chiao-Tung 
University.

本子計畫研究成果為應用於寬頻通訊接收機系統中的關鍵電路技術，包含一
個具有單端-雙端轉換功能的寬頻低雜訊放大器、提供 3GHz-5.7GHz 的本地振
盪源頻率輸出的三倍頻器、寬頻延遲電路、3-4 GHz 具有高輸入動態範圍的
相移器、1-5 GHz 頻率-電壓轉換器。分別敘述如下： 
(1)具有單端-雙端轉換功能的寬頻低雜訊放大器 
本電路主要貢獻在於將傳統需要分成兩級設計的低雜訊放大器與單端-雙端轉換
器，利用電路技巧結合成一個電路，降低電路元件數目與晶片面積。此外，本電
路提出可以改善增益與線性度的技術，但是沒有消耗額外的直流功率，使本電路
更適合用於系統整合中。進一步發展為整合下一級的混頻器與中頻可調增益放大
器，進而完成整個接收機系統。 
(2) 提供 3-5.7 GHz 的本地振盪源頻率輸出的三倍頻器 
本電路的主要貢獻為提出新式三倍頻產生器與一個可以消除輸出一倍頻的電路
技巧。有別於傳統利用被動濾波器的方式，本電路使用向量相消的方式，可大幅
降低核心的晶片面積，有助於系統整合的應用。進一步發展為整合頻率合成器，
如此一來可實現 1-1.9 GHz 與 3-5.7 GHz 雙頻帶的本地振盪源系統。 
(3)1-5 GHz 頻率-電壓轉換器 
本電路的貢獻為實現一個操作在 GHz 頻段的頻率電壓轉換器。主要貢獻為將傳統
只能操作在幾百 MHz 的電路方塊，利用不同的電路技術，大幅提升電路操作頻
率。此電路的優勢為不需要做頻率降頻的動作，可以直接偵測在 GHz 頻段的射頻
信號，降低電路設計的複雜度。進一步發展為整合前端放大器，可以製作成 FSK
解調器。另一個發展為與 PLL 作整合，可以增快鎖定的時間。 
(4) 寬頻延遲電路 
本電路實現一個操作頻率從 DC-4.38 GHz 的寬頻延遲電路，主要貢獻為使用主動
二階電路取代傳統利用電感來延伸頻寬的方式，本電路的優勢為縮小電路面積。
進一步發展為運用於時間陣列系統的整合以及基頻的等化器設計中。 
(5) 3-4 GHz 具有高輸入動態範圍的相移器 
本電路的貢獻為針對發射機因調變訊號振幅變化對傳統相移器會產生額外相位
與振幅失真做改善。本電路在相移器採用數位式的可調增益放大器來調整輸出的
相位，此電路優勢為增加電路的輸入動態範圍，適合用於發射機的整合。進一步
發展為與功率放大器、升頻器做完整的波束成型(beam-forming)系統。
