industrial applications, 2D mechanical arms are used widely because of their simplification 
and efficiency [1~3]. In this paper, pneumatic muscle actuators driven by pressure type 
servo-valves are used to setup a 2D pneumatic arm control system to simulate the motion 
of an excavator [1]. 
The muscle actuator consists of a cylindrical rubber bladder. Its relaxation and 
contraction is actuated via the pressure change of a rubber chamber. In order to compare 
this with the traditional linear actuator, the muscle actuator has high power/weight and 
power/volume ratios [4, 5]. Thus the muscle actuator is widely implemented in high 
payload, rehabilitation engineering and therapy robots. Due to the compressibility and 
non-linear elasticity of the rubber bladder, the muscle actuator is a non-linear component. 
This 2D pneumatic arm control system is a non-linear two-input two-output (TITO) system. 
Without the detailed model, fuzzy control algorithms have been found to be effective in 
dealing with non-linear, complicated and ill-defined systems. This paper proposes to 
implement the sliding-mode fuzzy controller and the self-learning fuzzy controller for a 2D 
pneumatic arm’s trajectory tracking control. In the sliding mode fuzzy controller, the fuzzy 
sliding surface is designed to reduce 2-dimensional fuzzy rules into 1-dimensional fuzzy 
rules and thus can simplify the learning processes of fuzzy rules’ optimization. The 
self-organizing fuzzy controller has a self-learning mechanism to modify fuzzy rules online. 
Then, the present paper can compare their trajectory tracking performances and evaluate 
their adaptations by a variety trajectory tracking experiments,.  
 
2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS 
The 2D pneumatic arm control system set up by muscle actuators is shown in Figure 1. 
8 
  
Here, 1θ  and 2θ  could be individually driven by each actuator. This 2D pneumatic arm 
control system is a non-coupled TITO system, and the controller can be designed for each 
sub-system individually. The functional block diagram of control structure is shown as Fig. 
2. 
In comparison with other control algorithms, the fuzzy control approach has been found 
to be an effective algorithm to deal with complicated, ill-defined and poor mathematically 
modeled dynamical processes. In general, the fuzzy rule base is 2-dimensional which 
depends on system variables (e, ce). Therefore, to optimize a 2-dimensional fuzzy rule 
table requires a lot of effort.  
The configuration of the sliding-mode fuzzy controller (SMFC) [6] is shown as Fig. 3. 
The sliding surface is proposed to simplify and reduce 2-dimensional fuzzy rules into 
1-dimensional fuzzy rules. It is described as 
    cees +⋅= α                                                              (5) 
where α  is a positive constant. The gains sG  and uG  are used to normalize between 
system variables and the universal of fuzzy sets. The fuzzy sets are finely divided into 13 
linguistic fuzzy subsets. Fuzzification is adopted the triangular-type membership function 
to obtain linguistic variables. The fuzzy inference is based on the Max-Min product 
composition and is used to operate fuzzy control rules. Then, the height method is used to

NVB=-1, NB=-0.8, NM=-0.5, NSM=-0.3, NS=-0.2, NVS=-0.1, ZO=0, PVS=0.1, PS=0.2, 
NSM=0.3, NM=0.5, NB=0.8 and NVB=1 are properly chosen to have low resolution at 
large error and high resolution at small error. Parameters of SOFC are 1== cee GG , 
10=uG , 5.0/ =Mr  and 5.0=ξ . 
To evaluate the control accuracy, the absolute position error is defined as

Here, the sampling time is 0.01second and thus N=400. The following experiments are 
included to evaluate control performances of SMFC with SOFC. Case 1 is a point-point 
control experiment and its command is a step function. Fig. 5 is the time response of Case 
1 without loading. In general, the effects of the rubber bladder’s elasticity and pneumatic 
compressibility would induce the time delay. Time responses indicate that both SMFC and 
SOFC have similar transient behaviours and both settling times are about 1.5 seconds. In 
the steady state, SOFC has better convergence and less oscillation. To compare their 
steady state errors e(k=400), SMFC is 0.96mm and SOFC is 0.32mm, which are 
summarized in Table 1. 
Fig. 6 is the time response of Case 1 with loading. Since the loading induces more  
12 
  
without loading and e  is enlarged to 1.76mm of Case 3 with loading. In SOFC, the 
trajectories of both figures have no significant difference, which means SOFC can adapt to 
variety loading. 
 
5 CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, SOFC and SMFC are applied for the trajectory tracking control of a 2D 
pneumatic muscle actuator’s arm. Comparisons of their tracking performance lead to 
following conclusions.  
1. A 2D pneumatic arm control system can be easily set up by pneumatic muscle actuators. 
Since it is a non-coupled TITO system, SMFC and SOFC can be designed for each 
sub-system individually and they could be properly implemented for trajectory tracking 
applications. 
2. To compare with the traditional fuzzy control, SMFC can reduce the fuzzy rule base and 
reduce the effort in the trial and error but its fixed fuzzy rule base has to be adjusted for 
different cases. 
3. The self-learning mechanism of SOFC can adjust fuzzy rules on-line, which skips the 
fuzzy rule’s learning process in SMFC. 
4. Experimental results indicate that SOFC has a better trajectory tracking and steady

and efficiency [1,2]. In this paper, pneumatic muscle actuators driven by pressure type 
servo-valves are used to setup a 2D pneumatic arm control system to simulate the motion 
of an excavator. 
Instead of the contacted displacement sensors, this paper implements the 
non-contacted CCD to capture the planer photo vision of pneumatic arm and transforms 
into two-dimensional displacement signal [3,4]. Both encoders and CCD are installed in 
this 2D pneumatic arm control system and their two-dimensional displacement can be 
simultaneously recorded for comparisons. It thus can study the measuring accuracy of 
CCD signal and evaluate the control performance based on CCD due to the photo vision 
two-dimensional displacement transformation.  
This 2D pneumatic arm is a non-linear control system. Without the detailed model, 
fuzzy control algorithms have been found to be effective in dealing with non-linear, 
complicated and ill-defined systems. The sliding-mode fuzzy controller and the 
self-learning fuzzy controller have been widely applied for pneumatic control systems [5,6]. 
To integrate the sliding-mode and self-learning fuzzy controllers, this paper proposes the 
self-organizing sliding-mode fuzzy controller [7] for the trajectory tracking control of 2D 
pneumatic arm. The sliding surface function is to reduce the two-dimensional into 
one-dimensional system variables. The one-dimensional self-learning mechanism 
provides the optimized fuzzy rules online. So, the present paper can compare the 
trajectory tracking performances of both CCD-based and encoder-based pneumatic arms 
via variety trajectory tracking experiments. And, it can evaluate the feasibility of replacing 
classical contacted sensors by the non-contacted CCD in the 2D pneumatic arm control 
system.

motion. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are functional block diagrams of control structures using CCD

This 2D pneumatic arm control system is a non-coupled two-inputs two-outputs system. 
1θ  and 2θ  could be individually driven by 1M  and 2M  muscle actuators respectively. 
And thus, the controller can be designed for each sub-system individually.  
In comparison with other control algorithms, the fuzzy control approach has been 
found to be an effective algorithm to deal with complicated, ill-defined and poor 
mathematically modeled dynamical process. In general, the fuzzy rule base is 
two-dimensional which depends on system variables ( e , e& ). To optimize a 
two-dimensional fuzzy rule table requires a lot of effort.

5. The projecting error is the portion of measuring error in X or Y coordinates. It indicates 
that the projecting errors of X and Y coordinates are slightly different. But, the measuring 
errors are very consistent and the average measuring error is 1.08mm. 
    Fig. 5 is the dynamic measuring error of point-point control experiment in Section 5. 
While the object’s velocity is under 10mm/s, the dynamic measuring error is near to the 
static measuring error. However, the dynamic measuring error becomes more significant 
at high objective’s velocity. The measuring error is up to 10mm at 45mm/s. It means the 
CCD measurement system be reliable at low speed applications. 
 
5 Experimental Results 
In the present paper, this 2D pneumatic arm control system is applied for variety trajectory 
tracking applications including step, ramp and parabolic commands. The sampling 
frequency of CCD-based system is valid within 28Hz. due to the limitations of photo vision 
capture process and computational loading. Although the encoder-based system could 
provide the high sampling frequency, the sampling time of following experiments of both 
CCD-based and encoder-based systems is fixed at 0.35 sec. in order to ignore the 
sampling effects. Parameters of SOSMFC are properly chosen as 3.0=sG , 8.3=uG , 
4=α , 1.0=γ  and 1=M . 
To evaluate the control accuracy, the absolute position error is defined as 
22 
  
average errors and steady state errors are summarized in Table 2. The average error of 
CCD-based system is 3.23mm, and encoder-based system is 2.75mm. Thus, CCD 
applied for measuring two-dimensional displacement in the 2D pneumatic arm control 
system is acceptable. 
Case 3 is a quadratic trajectory tracking control case. Its commands are 
)5()5(30)(30 −−−= tutttuX d  and )5()5(8.2)(8.2 22 −−−= tuttutYd . Fig. 9 is the trajectory 
tracking performance. The influence of system delay is tremendously decreased in 
both systems owing to the characteristics of parabolic function. Except the slight 
oscillations in the CCD-based system, the tracking performances of both CCD and 
encoder-based systems match well with the command. Fig 10 is their error analysis. In 
comparison with Case 2, the maximum errors have been tremendously reduced in the 
transient process, and the average errors are 2.51 and 2.35mm respectively.  Again, the 
performance of CCD-based system is similar to encoder-based system. It is reasonable to 
replace encoders by CCD in the trajectory tracking control of 2D pneumatic arm control 
system.  
 
6 Conclusions 
In this paper, it uses non-contacted CCD to replace classical contacted sensors in the 2D 
pneumatic arm control system. Both CCD-based and encoder-based systems use the
