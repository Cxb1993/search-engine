I. Introduction 
Sustainable economic growth and rising income levels in Taiwan have been accompanied by a rapid 
increase in the total of motorcycles on the road. By the end of November 2011, the number of domestic 
registered motorcycles totaled 14.833.198 [1]. With limited land and highly dense population in Taiwan, the 
emissions from motorcycles as well as vehicles (includes monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), carbon dioxide 
(CO2) and others) are the main sources of air contaminants in some urban centres, which have a severe impact 
on air quality and public health. Therefore, many stricter emission standards are implemented by 
Environmental Protection Department (EPD) in the aim of reducing the aforementioned emissions as well as 
greenhouse effect. As a result, the low-pollution and high efficiency are the key issues for domestic 
manufacture. For few years recently, many great efforts have been made such as electric motorcycle, port fuel 
injection engine, hybrid motorcycle, fuel cell motorcycle … It is found that the electronic fuel injection (EFI) 
system is the appropriate development for solving the aforementioned pollution problem, as it possesses many 
outstanding performance like carburetor. The improvement of efficiency of engine for reducing the consumed 
fuel, however, is still a problem, especially in low load and part load.

III. Research methods 
The research purpose of this project is retrofitting the intake manifold to enhance swirl motion also change 
the fuel injection system and injection timing of a motorcycle engine to improve the stratified mixture, by this 
way the engine can operate at high air fuel ratio which could not be done in original engine and called SDI 
engine. The first, computation fluid dynamic (CFD) was use to simulate air flow dynamic and fuel vapor in 
cylinder for 125cc single cylinder four stroke motorcycle engine to compare between original and SDI engine, 
it is including verification of spray structure, in-cylinder air motion and distribution of fuel concentration. The 
second, doing experiment on dynamometer engine test-bed to find out the parameter which help SDI engine 
can work in high air fuel ratio and compare lean limit between two engines, at last building the engine 
performance map at part load, which the normal vehicle driving always operate, comparing engine efficiency 
and exhaust emission. The third, establishment of dynamic engine model for SDI engine, including intake 
flow, combustion, torque, friction and engine rotational model, which will used for engine control in the next 
state. 
3.1 Computation fluid dynamic 
This study uses the transient three dimension SDI engine model established by CFD with spray model to 
calculate the distribution of fuel vapor in cylinder. The geometries of three types of intake port are shown in 
Fig. 3. Both two intake valves of original type are activated while one of them is deactivated in single type. In 
swirl type, a plate was employed to covered an intake port and allow the flow direction forward the other one. 
Therefore, the single and swirl type were simulated with one-hole injector, and two-holes for original type. 
The simulations were carried out at 4500 rpm of engine speed and 13% of the throttle opening. As the fuel 
concentration in cylinder was evaluated during intake and compression process only, thus the exhaust port 
was ignored. 
Fig. 4 shows the CFD engine model, which includes two defined Iso-Surface. In our evaluation of fuel 
concentration, the X-Surface and Y- surface were crossed the central position of spark plug and an intake port, 
respectively.

3.1.1 Numerical model 
In general, the leakage occurs in the gap between piston and piston rings, valve and valve seat, and thread 
of spark plug and cylinder head. However, those leakages have insignificant influence on the simulation result. 
Thus it is not unreasonable to ignore the leakage in CFD model.

3.1.3 Numerical method 
The engine running was considered as the transient problem, so Pressure Implicit with Splitting of 
Operators (PISO) algorithm was used in the numerical method. At first, it is a pressure-velocity calculation 
procedure developed for the non-iterative computation of unsteady compressible flows. Therefore, it includes 
a prediction step and two correction steps to satisfy the momentum equation and continuity equation [9]. 
3.1.4 CFD grid 
The moving mesh and sliding mesh techniques were employed to simulate the movement mechanism of 
piston and valve and combined with the events to switch the valve action within CFD software. 
In order to improve the accuracy of computation process, the mesh in port and valve region were refined as 
shown in Fig. 5. Also, the hybrid method which employed tetrahedral remeshing, was used to increase the 
accuracy of swirl and tumble at transient state [10].

3.1.5 Boundary and Initial condition 
In this study, the air is followed as ideal gas law and the effect of gravity in CFD model is not considered. 
(A) Inlet condition 
Inlet port is set to pressure-inlet boundary, it's same as the operating pressure 1 atm. The inlet temperature 
is set to 313 K. 
(B) Moving boundary 
Since the events controlled within Fluent, the movement of piston and valve are achieved. 
(C) Fix-wall boundary condition 
Each of walls satisfied the no-slip condition. The wall temperature referred to the paper of motorcycle 
engine in CFD software [11]. 
(D) Initial condition 
The real engine is transient and periodic problem. In principle, if the simulated time is enough, the solution 
of flow can be presented periodically, but this study just considers the intake stroke and compression stroke, 
so the assumptions of initial condition are important. 
In this study, the initial temperature is set 313 K, the turbulent kinetic and dissipation referred to 
experience equation [12]. For example, the turbulent kinetic and dissipation are evaluated at engine speed is 
4500 rpm, which is 39.34 m2/s2 and 37671.45 m2/s3. In this simulation, the Top Dead Center (TDC) position 
of intake stroke is defined as 360o CA, and combustion is 720o CA. 
3.1.6 Independent of grid 
In order to more approach the physical phenomena of real engine in simulated results. This study performs 
the grid independent analysis of average cylinder pressure. As piston at TDC position, the CFD engine model 
was established with different amounts of grid. When the grid increased to 423,724 nodes, the average 
cylinder pressure is not dependent on quantity of grid, as shown in Fig. 6. However, the maximum error 
percentage of average cylinder pressure is 8 % with 384,453 nodes. Due to the consideration of time and costs, 
the node quantity is in the range of 384,453 to 423,724.

Engine control was accomplished by using a MotoHawk ECU 555-80 controller produced by Woodward to 
control the fuel injection rate and injection timing. The MotoHawk allows the user to automatically generate 
machine code from Simulink diagrams and operate control hardware in real-time operation.

3.2.2 Fuel system 
Zhao [13] surveyed many GDI papers and reported that a well-atomized fuel spray must be produced for 
all operating conditions. The mean drop size is typically 16 microns SMD (Sauter mean diameter) as 
compared to 120 microns SMD with the PFI system. To improve the fuel atomization, an air-assisted fuel 
injection system produced by KYMCO (Kwang Yang Motor Co., Ltd.) was used. It includes 3 major 
components: (1) Fuel injector—A conventional port fuel injector is used to control fuel into a mixing chamber 
between the fuel injector and air injector. (2) Mixing chamber—A mixing region exists to ensure correct fuel 
delivery from the fuel injector into the air injector. The mixing chamber also provides the link to the 
compressed air circuit that is used to force the fuel from air injector into intake manifold. (3) Air injector—
This injector injects a mixture of fuel and air into intake port.

Fig. 8 shows the comparison of fuel atomization between the original PFI injector and air-assisted fuel 
injector. The picture was captured by a Fastec Imaging high-speed camera (Trouble Shooter). From the image,

The motorcycle emission regulations of many countries follow the ECE-40 driving cycle. Figure 10 shows 
the engine BMEP curve as a solid line and ECE-40 operating points as triangle markers for the target 
motorcycle’s 125 cc engine. The square line in Figure 4 is located in an engine speed range of 3500 to 5500 
rpm, and BMEP from 1.5 to 4 bars. This consists of most of the ECE-40 operating points. The engine-
performance map tests were conducted using these criteria; i.e., engine speed from 3500 to 5500 rpm with 
steps of 500 rpm and BMEP from 1.5 to 4 bar with steps of 0.5 bar.  
 
Fig. 10    Engine map of ECE-40 cycle. 
The PFI fuel injection pressure was 2.45 bars. The air-assisted fuel injection system comprises 1.96 bars of 
air and 4.9 bars of fuel. The PFI injection timing was set at 90o BTDC (before top dead center) of the exhaust 
stroke, and that of SDI was determined from lean limit testing. The PFI fuel injection duration was controlled 
to obtain stoichiometric air/fuel ratio, and that of SDI was controlled to run at lean combustion constraining 
COV (coefficient of variation of IMEP) to less than 10% for lean limit testing and not higher than 5% for 
engine map running. The spark advance was controlled at MBT (Maximum Brake Torque) of engine running.  
The data taken from the engine test were: engine speed, torque, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), 
brake specific CO emission (BSCO), brake specific HC emission (BSHC), brake specific NOx emission 
(BSNOx). The brake specific emissions were defined as the mass emission rates divided by the engine brake 
horsepower. The mass emission rates were calculated according to SAE J1088. A set of experimental data at 
5500 rpm and 4 Nm for five repeated tests were analyzed based on the method of Kline and McClintock 
(Holman, 1989) for calculating the uncertainty of the experimental data. The uncertainty in the experimental 
results is shown in Table 3.

4.1.2 In-cylinder air motion 
Fig. 13a showed the air motion of original port with homogenous charge, swirl motion was not observed 
during intake process. The simulation results of single port and swirl port are shown as Fig. 13b and Fig. 13c. 
From Fig. 13b, the single port produced the swirl motion obviously, and it is stronger in the swirl port during 
intake process (Fig. 13c). 
4.1.3 Distribution of fuel concentration 
In this study, the fuel concentration was calculated that the overall fuel/air equivalence ratio is equal to 1. 
The simulated result is shown as Fig. 14 and Fig. 15. The gray map means the value of mass fraction of fuel 
vapor in shown figures. Fig. 14 is the result of mass fraction of fuel vapor at 540o CA. Fig. 15 is the result of 
mass fraction of fuel vapor at 690o CA. 
It can be seen from Fig. 14a and 15a, the fuel vapor is homogenous due to the fuel and air are premixed in 
intake port. However, the richer fuel vapor nears the upper position of cylinder head that single port and swirl 
port produces the swirl motion in cylinder during intake process (Fig. 14b and c). The effect of stratified 
charge were achieved in the single and swirl port. The upper fuel vapor was richer than the bottom in cylinder. 
Especially, the swirl port had stronger swirl motion than single one, so that the fuel vapor of swirl port was 
richer than the single port. Therefore, the droplet distributed upper region of the cylinder wall due to 
centrifugal force of swirl motion in swirl port (Fig. 16a). From Fig. 16b, a richer fuel vapor was concentrated 
on the both sides of combustion chamber.

timing at 80oCA ATDC, which is near the middle of intake stroke, has lowest COV. So this injection timing 
was taken for the following SDI engine test.   
Fig. 17 also indicates that the best injection timing is not affected by engine speed. Ohm et al. [5] had the 
same conclusion that lean misfire limit or stability of engine did not depend on engine speed, because early 
flame stability was dominated not by turbulence but by AFR around the spark plug at spark timing. 
Stratification of mixture resulting from port swirl and injection timing were show to govern the lean limit.

Fig. 17    Effect of injection timing on cycle variation of SDI engine 
Fig. 18 shows the lean limit at 4500 and 5300 rpm low loads of original engine and SDI engine [17]. The 
COV value is limited as no more than 10%, and the lean limit is taken as the maximum excess air ratio 
(lambda, λ) when COV is 10%. The original engine has low lean limits, which are 1.34 for 4500 rpm and 1.37 
for 5300 rpm. However, the SDI engine increases lean limit of lambda value up to 1.7 for both engine speeds. 
A homogeneous charge SI engine cannot achieve so lean. Therefore, it must have the effect of charge 
stratification.

Fig. 19    MBT spark timing as a function of lambda for PFI and SDI engines 
The spark timing was set at MBT (maximum brake torque) in engine test. MBT timing increases with 
increasing lambda [17] as shown in Fig. 19 due to the slow burn of lean mixture. The MBT timing of original

duration because of more fuel distributed near spark plug, so the combustion rate is higher. The burn duration 
of 5300 rpm is lower than that of 4500 rpm due to higher TPS of 5300 rpm. 
4.2.3 Engine performance map 
A common way to present the operating characteristic of an internal combustion engine is to plot BSFC, 
BSCO, BSHC and BSNOx contours on a graph of BMEP versus engine speed. Fig. 22 shows the BSFC maps 
of SDI engine and original engine in low loads [17]. The triangle markers in the figure show the operating 
points of ECE driving cycle. The result is clear that, SDI engine has better fuel consumption than original 
engine at part load. By taking the average of all testing points in the map, the reduction of fuel consumption is 
11.3% as compared between SDI and original engines. It is obvious that the SDI engine runs at lean burn, so 
the pumping loss and heat loss are decreased. Another possibility is the stratified charge to improve the 
combustion.  
 
Fig. 22    BSFC map in low load region 
Fig. 23 shows the BSCO maps of SDI engine and original engine in low loads [17]. BSCO of original 
engine is much higher than that of SDI. By taking the average of all testing points in the map, the reduction of 
BSCO is 92.9% for SDI. This advantage come from that SDI engine runs at lean burn. Nevertheless, the 
original engine is operated with stoichiometric mixture.  
 
Fig. 23    BSCO map in low load region 
Fig. 24 shows the BSNOx maps of SDI engine and original engine in low loads [17]. BSNOx of SDI 
engine is quite low. By taking the average of all testing points in the map, the reduction of BSNOx is 32.0% 
for SDI. As a rule-of-thumb, NOx emission gets peak value at slightly lean AFR (air-fuel ratio), and decreases 
in both very lean and rich sides. In homogeneous charge lean burn system, the lean limit is generally less than 
20 of AFR (i.e. 1.36 of lambda) as shown in previous paper [19]. At such condition, NOx emission increases 
tremendously, because the AFR close to the peak value of NOx emission. In this research however, the lean 
limit of SDI achieves 1.7 of lambda, so the NOx emission decreases.

VI. Conclusion 
A 125 cc 4-valve engine was retrofitted by designing a control plate to enhance the swirl of intake flow at 
low load. This design combined high swirl and injection during intake valve opening to produce stratified 
charge, which is called semi-direct injection (SDI). The computation fluid dynamic show that the SDI engine 
has good stratified mixture than original engine, by doing experiment, the lean limit was extended to 1.7 of 
lambda. The engine was tested at low load region which comprised most operation points of ECE-40 driving 
cycle. A complete engine performance map under half load operation was conducted for comparison between 
SDI and original SI engines. Computation and measurements of various combustion characteristics and 
emissions on the target engine have led to the following conclusions: 
(1) Through using the CFD numerical method to analyze the transient in-cylinder flow in SDI engine, the 
air motion could be observed. Also, it has significant effect on the distribution of fuel concentration. It is 
found that the single port and swirl port could improved swirl motion in cylinder. Especially, swirl port had 
stronger swirl motion during intake process in cylinder. And it could produce the stratified charge when the 
fuel injected into cylinder.  
 (2) Injection timing has much influence on the combustion stability of SDI system. The injection timing at 
around the middle point of intake stroke is a good choice. 
(3) The lean limit of SDI system has been extended to 1.7 of lambda. A homogeneous charge SI engine 
cannot achieve so lean. Therefore, it must have the effect of charge stratification. 
(4) The heat release rate and burn duration of SDI system are improved due to stratified charge and swirl 
motion. 
(5) Within part load region which consists most of engine operating points of ECE-40 driving cycle, SDI 
performs quite well. By taking the average of all testing points in this region, BSFC and BSNOx are reduced 
by 11.3% and 32.0%, respectively, BSCO decreases tremendously by 92.9%. However, BSHC increases 
47.7%. 
(6) The engine model of SDI engine was developed and validated with experimental data. It shows that the 
modeling process is close to reality. The heat release model proposed in this work needs more engine test data 
for validation.

由於氣道燃油噴射(port fuel injection, PFI)系統之噴油嘴的燃油壓
力較低，其霧化的效果較差，較不易應用於半直接噴射(semi-
direct injection, SDI)系統。因此其可藉由高壓空氣作為輔助，提
升噴油嘴的霧化效果。本計畫提出的噴射供油裝置為透過燃油撞
擊壁面而碎裂成微小液滴的方式，再藉由高壓空氣將微小液滴吹
出裝置外，以改善噴油嘴的霧化效果。 
英文： 
Due to the injector of port fuel injection (PFI) system has lower 
pressure of fuel, the injector has poor effect of atomization. It not 
easier to apply to semi-direct injection (SDI) system. An assisted 
compressed air is used to enhance the effect of injector atomization. A
supplied device of fuel is used to produce the smaller parcels of 
droplet by impact of fuel on the wall, and then the parcels are blown to 
outside the device by compressed air. Then it can be used to improve 
effect of atomization for injector.

討會從 9 月 14 日排得滿滿的，我選擇了引擎燃燒以及控制方面的題目參
加，尤其注意 HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition)以及引擎控制
方面(空燃比控制、MFB50 估測、以及某些量測的方法等)。 
本次研討會在燃燒方面的論文相當多，而其中也不乏探討低溫燃燒之
HCCI 或 PCCI 的論文以及汽油缸內直噴(GDI)的論文，在這些論文當中，各方
面問題的探討都有，燃料特性、燃燒參數研究、多種燃料、各種引擎、燃燒控
制…等。此外，為了學習引擎控制的方法，以便能運用在 HCCI 燃燒的控制，
本次研討會的論文當中，我發現某些論文，例如：on-line 各缸效率的估測、
MFB50 的估測、等，這些論文都對 HCCI 引擎控制上有很大的幫助，因此我也
選擇參與這些場次的研討會。本次研討會我參與的場次如下所示： 
 7 
題，只要研發關鍵的層狀進氣技術，將會有類似 GDI 的效果。 
(4) HCCI引擎發展的關鍵，在於如何能準確的控制 HCCI引擎的燃燒，欲控制 HCCI
燃燒，必須要先能得知汽缸內燃燒情形，因此若能夠利用較便宜的方法來預測汽
缸內燃燒情形，則對 HCCI控制會有相當的助力。
