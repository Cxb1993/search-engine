Abstract 
In this study a TiO2/CNT coaxial structure and 
standing CNT array laminated photocatalyst to enhance 
the photolysis efficiency of TiO2 is presented. An 
electrochemical bath that used a nano porous AAO 
membrane as the separation grating to separate two 
vessels with a transmembrane concentration gradient 
was constructed. The catalysed photolysis efficiency 
was measured in terms of the photolysis induced ion 
current. The experimental results demonstrated that the 
photolysis efficiency of TiO2 could be increased by the 
high electron conductibility of the standing CNT array. 
The experimental results also indicated that photolysis 
efficiency could be enhanced by increasing the height 
of the standing CNT array substrate; however it 
degraded as the thickness of the TiO2/CNT coaxial 
structure and the TiO2 shell increased.

1. Introduction 
Photocatalyst is a material that can convert 
photon energy into chemical energy by absorbing light 
with the same energy as its band gap. In catalysed 
photolysis, the catalyst generates electron–hole pairs, 
which react with water and oxygen, to produce 
hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen ions, which then 
oxidize oragnic materials from the ambient atmosphere. 
This mechanism has been understood ever since Honda 
and Fujishima [1] used TiO2 as the electrode to split 
water into H2 and O2. The most widely used 
photocatalyst is titanium dioxide, due to its high 
chemical stability and photolysis capability [2-4]. 
Several researchers have recently explored its excellent 
photo-electric properties [5-7]. The catalysed photolysis 
of TiO2 under UV light irradiations is well documented 
to excite an electron (e-) from the valence band to the 
conduction band, generating a hole (h+) at the valence 
band edge. 
2TiO eh hν − ++ → +  (1) 
The generations of active species of oxygen and 
hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) can be described as follows [8, 
9].

The oxidation of H2O by h+ is another path to produce 
⋅OH, and simultaneously generates H+ [8-11]. 
2h H O OH H
+ ++ → ⋅ +  (6) 
 During photolysis, volume recombination or 
surface recombination of the generated electron-hole 
pairs is likely to occur, thereby reducing the ability of 
succeeding reactions. Metal is often used as an additive 
to the TiO2 to encourage effective conveyance of the 
electrons so that the electron-hole separations can be 
ensured. 
For a semiconductor such as TiO2, the band gap 
generally refers to the energy difference between the 
top of the valence band and the bottom of the 
conduction band. When a material is nano-sized in 
dimensions, the total amount of atoms contained therein 
is substantially reduced. The density of states is thus 
decreased and the effective band gap is enlarged. For 
those nano particles with larger band gaps than their 
bulk form, the corresponding absorption and 
fluorescence spectra are blue-shifted. i.e., the absorbed 
light has a shorter wavelength [12, 13]. Therefore, the 
photo induced electron-hole pairs in a photocatalyst 
possess stronger redox ability, which, enhances the 
photolysis potency. The photolysis efficiency of TiO2 
can also be improved by compounding the oxide and 
carbon nano tubes (CNT) into a CNT/TiO2 composite 
[14-18]. The strong interactive force between these two 
materials enables the photo induced electrons to be 
quickly conveyed to the CNTs. Furthermore, the 
photogenerated current of the TiO2/CNT is presumed to 
be markedly larger than that from a pure TiO2 film. The 
enhanced photolysis efficiency can be interpreted as 
follows. UV irradiation generates e--h+ pairs on the 
TiO2 film. As illustrated in Figure 1, the conduction

Figure 4 shows the SEM images of the fabricated 
CNT array with the processing time being 13 min after 
the power reached 1100 W. It indicates that a thin layer 
of TiO2/CNT coaxial structure, similar to that presented 
in previous works [21-23], was formed at the upper 
portion of the standing CNT array substrate. The size of 
the TiO2/CNT coaxial tubes as amplified in the inset is 
larger than that of the standing CNTs below. Figure 4 
displays SEM images of the titanium oxide thin 
film-covered CNT array.

A Raman spectroscopy (Nanofinder 30, Tokyo 
Instruments, Japan) and an EDS spectrum were used to 
indicate the existence of the TiO2/CNT composite. The 
Raman spectra are shown in Figure 5. The peak at 145 
cm-1 indicates the existence of TiO2. The peak at 246 
cm-1 shows the spectrum of the brookite crystallization. 
However, the peaks at 400 cm-1, 527 cm-1 and 640 cm-1 
showing the spectra of the anatase crystallization [26-28] 
are not so obvious due to the relatively slim layer of the 
TiO2/CNT coaxial structure. The EDS spectrum shown 
in Figure 6 also illustrates the existence of TiO2.

3. Optical Absorption Spectra of the TiO2/CNT 
Nanostructure Photocatalyst 
    The optical absorption spectra were obtained using 
a UV/VIS spectrophotometer operated in reflection 
mode to elucidate the light-harvesting characteristics of 
the TiO2/CNT coaxial structure and standing CNT array 
laminated photocatalyst. For comparison, the absorption 
of a pure TiO2 film deposited on a silicon substrate was 
also measured. Figure 7 shows the absorption spectra of 
the pure TiO2 film and the TiO2/CNT composite 
photocatalyst. The absorption is calculated with the 
equation 2(1 ) / 2R R− , where R is the ratio of the 
reflected intensity of the sample to that of a reflectance 
standard. The TiO2 film shows an UV absorption peak 
at λ = 375 nm, which is associated with the 
fundamental transition (valence band (VB) to 
conduction band (CB)) of TiO2. In contrast, the 
absorption spectrum of the TiO2/CNT coaxial structure 
and standing CNT array laminated photocatalyst 
exhibits two broad absorption peaks: one at UV (λ = 
371 nm), the other at near infrared (λ = 673 nm). Earlier 
works [29, 30] have revealed that the former peak arises 
from the optical absorption of the trapped holes whereas 
the latter arises from the trapped electrons. When TiO2 
is irradiated with UV radiation, electrons are excited to 
CB, leaving holes behind in VB. These electrons and 
holes can be trapped by trapping sites on the TiO2 
surface. EPR investigations have shown that the 
electron trapping sites are Ti+4 ions present at the TiO2 
particle surface [30]. Optical transitions from the 
trapping sites to CB or VB result in the absorption 
peaks in Figure 6. 
 
4. Device for the Measurement of Catalysed 
Photolysis Efficiency 
To measure the catalysed photolysis efficiency, an 
electrochemical bath (see Figure 8) was made of acrylic 
with dimensions of 3.5mm × 2.5mm × 2.4mm. A 
concentration gradient was constructed by employing 
an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane to 
separate this into two vessels. The pore diameter of the 
AAO membrane was about 50 nm. Photolysis produced 
hydrogen ions in one of the two vessels which created 
an ion concentration gradient between opposite sides of 
  6
 The above photolysis currents measuring results 
support our conjecture that a simpler TiO2/CNT coaxial 
structure and standing CNT array laminated structure is 
more effective to conduct the task of photolysis. 
 
5.2 Dependency of the Photolysis Efficiency on the 
Thickness of the CNT Array 
Since the nanostructure of a CNT array can 
reduces the recombination of electron-hole pairs of 
TiO2, it is worthwhile to examine the dependency of the 
photolysis efficiency on the thickness of the CNT array 
substrate. Four CNT arrays (5.32 μm, 3.45 μm, 2.68 μm 
and 1.5 μm in height) (see Figure 11) which all were 
subjected to a 15 min of TiO2 deposition were 
experimented to examine the influence of the CNT 
structure on the photolysis efficiency. The ratio of the 
TiO2/CNT coaxial structure in the device decreases 
with the increasing of the standing CNT array 
thickness.

heights; (a) 5.32 μm (b)3.45 μm (c)2.68 μm (d)1.5 μm 
     
The comparisons of photolysis efficiency (in terms 
of the photolysis induced ion current) are illustrated in 
Figure 12. The results indicate that the photolysis 
efficiency increases with increasing CNT array 
thickness. This is because a thicker CNT array increases 
the CNT/TiO2 ratio of the laminated photocatalyst so 
that more photoelectrons can be conveyed to the CNT 
array, increasing the photolysis efficiency. Thus for a 
higher photolysis efficiency, a thicker CNT array is 
suggested. 
The photolysis efficiency comparison results 
further demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more 
effective for photolysis applications. 
 
5.3 Experimental Verification of the Photolysis 
Efficiency 
 As the above discussions make clear, the 
photolysis efficiency of a TiO2/CNT nanostructure 
photocatalyst can be raised either by a thinner 
TiO2/CNT coaxial structure or a thicker CNT array. To 
further verify this, we produced a TiO2/CNT coaxial 
structure and standing CNT array laminated 
photocatalyst composed of a 6.78 μm high CNT array 
and a 15 min TiO2 deposited coaxial structure was 
produced. For comparisons, the photocurrents of a pure 
15 min deposition TiO2 and a Degussa P25 thin film 
were included. Due to the limitation in obtaining a 
sputtering target of Degussa P25, its thin film was 
fabricated by the conventional sol-gel process. The 
preparations of the Degussa P25 thin film were: making 
a solution of the Degussa P25 by mixing 6g of 250nm 
TiO2 powder with 100M DI water, 0.012g of nitric acid, 
3.4g of PEG (glycol), and 2g of acetone; spin-coating 
the solution on a 15mm×5mm glass substrate; sintering 
it at 450°C for 30 min. The total amount of the TiO2 and 
the resulting thin film thickness were much larger than 
the sputtered TiO2 film. Figure 13 illustrates that the 
proposed scheme can remarkably enhance the 
photolysis efficiency of TiO2.

different thickness of CNT arrays 
6. Conclusions 
In this study, a TiO2/CNT coaxial structure and 
standing CNT array laminated photocatalyst was 
fabricated by sputtering a TiO2 thin film on a standing 
CNT array. The increase in the photolysis efficiency of 
TiO2 was investigated. An electrochemical bath in 
which a nano porous AAO membrane was used as a 
filter to separate two vessels of different concentrations 
was assembled.  This was used to examine the 
efficiency of catalysed photolysis in terms of the 
photolysis induced ion current. The experimental results 
demonstrated that the photolysis efficiency was 
enlarged both by the quantum effects of the sputtered 
nano size TiO2 particles, and the high electron 
conductibility of the standing CNT array.  
The UV-VIS absorption peak red-shifted as the 
thickness of the TiO2/CNT coaxial structure and the 
TiO2 shell increased. It can be inferred that a thicker 
material has a more compact structure, resulting in a 
lower band gap; therefore, the UV-VIS absorption peak 
shifts to the right. Moreover, the photolysis induced ion 
current decreased with increasing TiO2/CNT coaxial 
structure thickness and TiO2 shell thickness. The most 
likely reason for this is that it was more difficult for the 
photoelectrons in the upper layers of a thicker 
TiO2/CNT coaxial structure and the outer portion of a

Abstract 
We present a simple and cost-effective approach 
by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for 
the accurate pore size estimation of silicon based 
nanopores. This method takes into account the 
capacitor effects of the electrical double layer and the 
resistor effects of the ion concentration inside the 
nanochannel. The nanopore impedance was modeled 
as the electrolyte resistance Rs in series with a parallel 
ion diffusion circuit charge transfer resistance Rf with 
a constant phase element (CPE) that models the 
behavior of the double layer. EIS analysis, which has 
been widely employed to measure the energy storage 
and dissipation properties of physico-chemical 
systems in a frequency domain, was adopted to 
obtain the impedance parameters of the nanopores. 
The nanopore size was then estimated from the 
impedance parameters. The accuracy of the estimated 
nanopore size was verified using an transmission 
electron microscope (TEM) image.

1. Introduction 
Recent progress in nanotechnology has resulted 
in increasing interest in nanopore fabrication and 
application. Nanopores are versatile nanodevices in 
biological systems. A living cell uses protein 
nanopores and channels to communicate with the 
extracellular environment. Feasible nanopore 
applications in biotechnology include ion pumping,1) 
ion-channel biosensors,2) DNA sequencing and 
separation,3,4) polymer length determination and 
separation,5) biosensors,6) the imitation of a cell 
membrane,7,8) and nucleic acid detection.9-13) For 
these biological applications, the pore diameter and 
length are required to be slightly larger than the size 
of the object to be detected (less than 20 nm) to 
ensure accurate detection.  
Numerous materials have been used as the 
fabricated nanopore substrate. Among them, silicon 
substrates have been the most commonly used 
material due to their high bio compatibility and 
semiconductor-process compatibility.14-17) Several 
methods have been developed to precisely fabricate 
nanopores including ion-beam sculpting,18) electron 
beams,19) oxidation,20,21) vapor-etching,22) and track 
etching.23) However, most of these techniques usually 
involve costly fabrication equipment and processes. 
Some of them are only applicable to specific 
materials, which is cost-ineffective and limits 
potential application. Park et al.24) fabricated 
nanopores on silicon using electrochemical track 
etching and thermal oxidation. Wang et al.25) 
manufactured silicon based nanopores using a 
specially designed fixture to enable better control of 
the track-etching process. A 19 nm nano pore can be 
produced without additional thermal oxidation. 
Even though electrochemical track etching is a 
convenient and cost-effective method of fabricating 
nanopores on silicon substrates, precise pore size 
measurement cannot easily be conducted. Due to the 
etching rate difference between the <100> plane and 
<111> plane of a silicon substrate, a concave pyramid 
structure is always obtained at the end of wet etching. 
Since the concave pyramid structure is deep, the 
track-etched nanopore at the tip of the pyramid is 
difficult to directly evaluate by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). A transmission electron 
microscope (TEM) image is an alternative solution. 
However, to obtain a useful TEM image the device 
must be cut to a smaller size to fit in the TEM holder 
and polished to decrease its thickness(< 100µm) to 
avoid back light diffraction. Consequently, the device 
is damaged and cannot be further used. Moreover, 
focusing on a nanopore to obtain a TEM image is not 
an effortless task. The relatively high cost is another 
drawback. A simple, nondestructive nanopore 
diameter measurement approach is thus greatly 
desired. 
In general, a physico-chemical system such as 
an electrochemical cell or biological tissue has both 
energy storage and energy dissipation properties. A 
membrane with a nanopore in an electrochemical 
bath can be considered as an electrochemical cell. 
The equivalent impedance of a nanochannel can be 
modeled as a series of finite RC circuit connections.26) 
The capacitor (energy storage) and resistor (energy 
dissipator) represent the impedances of the electrical 
double layer27,28) and the buffer solution, respectively. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy29) (EIS) has 
been widely employed over the past few years to 
evaluate the energy storage and dissipation properties 
of a physico-chemical system over a range of 
frequencies.  
In this article, a simple and cost-effective 
approach by EIS for the pore size estimation of a 
silicon-based nanopore by EIS is presented. In this 
novel approach, a mathematical model that relates the 
size of a nanopore to the impedance of the electrolyte 
is discussed. The nanopore impedance was modeled 
as an electrolyte charge transfer resistance Rs in series 
with a parallel ion diffusion circuit Rf with a constant 
phase element (CPE) that describes the behavior of 
the double layer. EIS was then adopted to measure 
    10
operation of circuits in a high-frequency domain.32) In 
our applications, only a low-frequency region is 
implemented, hence, the influence of the parasitic 
capacitance can be neglected.  The electrical 
impedance of the CPE can be described by33,34)

4. Experiments and Discussion 
4.1 EIS analysis 
To conduct the EIS analysis, a membrane 
transport double cell made of acrylic, as shown in Fig. 
4, was fabricated. A silicon-based membrane with a 
nanopore partitions the two vessels with different 
concentrations of an identical electrolyte to generate 
a concentration gradient and an Ag/AgCl electrode. 
The implemented electrolyte solution was KCl. EIS 
(Model 273, Princeton Applied Research) was 
performed at a frequency range from 1 to 100 kHz. 
Impedance spectroscopy Data analysis software 
(Zview) was adopted to calculate the total resistances 
(Rs, Rf) and CPE capacitances (y0, n) of the 
nanochannel from the Nyquist impedance plot. 
Fig. 6 shows the resulting Nyquist plot 
representing the nanopore impedance for different 
concentration ratios. The real part increases with 
frequency. However, the imaginary part reaches a 
maximum at a certain frequency.  
Table І tabulates the nanopore impedance 
parameters extracted from Fig. 6 using the Zview 
software. The charge transfer resistance of ion 
diffusion Rf, that is the double-layer property, which 
is much larger than the electrolyte resistance Rs. For a 
nanopore, the ratio between the thickness of the 
double layer and the pore diameter is relatively high; 
therefore, Rf is much larger than Rs. It is also found 
that both Rs and Rf decrease with increasing 
concentration ratio, indicating that the nanopore 
resistance is a function of the electrolyte 
concentration inside the nanopore. According to 
Fick’s law, a higher transmembrane concentration 
ratio produces greater diffusion, resulting in a larger 
transmembrane electric potential. Therefore, the 
osmosis effect at the nanopore wall becomes less 
effective and Rf decreases. Similarly, the high 
concentration ratio induced by the transmembrane 
potential increases the mobility of the charged ions 
inside the nanopore according to the Nernst law, 
resulting in a relatively lower electrolyte resistance 
Rs.  
Fig. 7 illustrates the polynomial fitting and linear 
fitting of the nanopore impedance based on the 
experimental data.  The nanopore impedance 
approaches a stable value at higher concentration 
ratios.  
 
4.2 Pore size estimation 
Using the nanopore impedance parameters 
illustrated in Table І, the nanopore diameter can be 
estimated using Equation (7). Table П illustrates the 
estimated nanopore size. The specific conductivity σ 
of the KCl solution at 25 ºC is 0.111 Ω-1cm-1. The 
pore thickness L and the side length of the etching 
window db were 3.53 and 5 µm, respectively.  
Fig. 8 shows a TEM image of the implemented 
nanopore. The pore diameter is about 19 nm. There is 
a 3 nm variation in diameter for a concentration of 
7.5 folds difference in concentration ratio. Compared 
with the estimated pore diameters for different 
concentration ratios illustrated in Table П, the AC 
analysis by EIS at a higher transmembrane 
concentration ratio can accurately estimate the 
nanopore size.

Step (d): Patterning the backside Si3N4 film 
The ICP-RIE (Cirie-100) dry etching is 
adopted to transfer the etch window into the Si3N4 
film. The process parameters of the ICP-RIE are: 
reaction gas-CF4 with flow rate being 45 sccm, 
working pressure-5 mtorr, RF power-500 W, 
processing time-6 min. 
Step (e) & (f): Processing anisotropic wet etching on 
the backside silicon 
After removing the photoresist, the uncovered 
silicon surface is wet-etched by a 50% (w/w) KOH at 
95°C for 4 hours. Figure 3 displays the after etching 
structure for a 1×1 mm2 etch window.

min.

Although the dimension of the front side window 
can be accurately calculated to fabricate through 
nanopores in silicon using only the double-sided 
etching process, the etching process involves many 
uncertainties and is difficult to be precisely 
controlled. An additional track-etching that enables 
the etching through process can be on-line monitored 
is desired. 
(2) Track-etching 
As shown in Figure 2, a specially designed 
fixture is designed to hold the pre-etched silicon 
wafer inside it such that the front side of the wafer 
faces the KCL solution (1M) and the pyramid is full 
of KCL solution. Simultaneously, the back side of the 
wafer is anisotropically wet-etched by the KOH 
etchant (50%) which is contained by a larger glass 
vessel. The ionic solution KCl that has higher 
hydraulic pressure is used to suppress the KOH, 
preventing the resulting nanopore from being over 
etched. Since the track-etching rate is 18 nm/min, the 
experimental apparatus as shown in Figure 2 enables 
convenient process termination by only taking out the 
fixture as soon as the nanopore is formed.

setup 
 
Two platinum electrodes are put into the KOH 
and KCl solutions respectively and connected by a 
conductive wire. An electrochemical system 
PARSTAT 2236 (Princeton Applied Research) is 
employed and a 300 mV electric potential is applied 
to examine the current once the pre-etched cavities 
are etched into a through nanopore, allowing ions 
exchanging between the KOH and KCl solutions.  
During the etching process, silicon is etched by 
the hydroxyl ions in the etchant to generate silicon 
hydroxide and free electrons. Therefore, the anode 
and cathode are placed in the KOH etchant and the 
KCl solution, respectively. The anode attracts the 
hydroxyl ions such that the etching rate can be slow 
down and a more precise nanopore can be fabricated. 
In general, a nano scale pore should allow both 
the cation (K+, 0.137nm) and anion (Cl-, 0.181 nm) to 
penetrate simultaneously. However, due to the 
electric osmosis inside a nonopore, the ion diffusion 
induced current becomes too slight to be efficiently 
detected. An applied electric potential is thus needed 
to drive the ions traveling through the nanopore to 
enable real time monitoring of the nanopore 
formation. 
 
3. Experimental Results and Discussions 
(1) Mask and etching duration design 
The dimensions of the mask and the duration of 
each wet etching process need to be determined 
according to the wafer thickness. The thickness of the 
silicon wafer used is 380 µm.  
During the first wet-etching period, the front 
surface is desired to be etched to an inverted pyramid 
with its depth being less than the thickness of the 
    18
rectification and pumping ions. American J. Phys.

2.2 Ion diffusion induced electrical potential 
Based on the CGA model, the ion diffusion 
induced electrical potential across a membrane with 
through nano-channels can be calculated as,

ln( )cTV V V
q c
κ= − =  (4) 
Similar to Equation (3), the above expression can 
only describe the ion diffusion induced electrical 
potential across a membrane.  
Inside a nano-channel both the concentration 
gradient and osmosis effects affect ion behaviors. The 
flux of ions that counts both the concentration 
gradient and osmosis effect can be described using, 
xV T ccz
x q x
μκψ μ ∂ ∂= − −∂ ∂  (5) 
The first item is the electric osmosis flux and the 
second item denotes the ion diffusion flux. Where c 
is the ion concentration, z is the valence of ions, μ 
denotes the mobility of ions, Vx is the electrical 
potential at a distance x from the entrance of a 
nano-channel, q is the charge on each ion, T is the 
absolute temperature, κ is the Boltzman constant. 
 
3. Diffusion Induced Current inside a 
Nanochannel 
3.1 Impedance of a Nanochannel 
The ion diffusion induced electrical potential 
across a membrane with through nano-channels can 
be described using Equation (4). To further identify 
the ion diffusion induced current through the 
nano-porous membrane, the impedance of the 
membrane must be modeled.16) 
As mentioned, diffusion ions traveling along a 
nano-channel are influenced by both the diffusion 
and electric osmosis fluxes resulting from the 
electrical double layer as schematically depicted in 
Figure 2. The electrical double layer consists of the 
fixed Stern layer and the diffuse Gouy-Chapman 
layer, which gives an electrical potential (zeta 
potential) between the wall of the nano-channel and 
bulk of the buffer solution that carries the ions.17-18) 
The potential φ inside a microchannel that is 
subjected to electro-osmosis effect can be 
approximated by  
exp( / )w Dyφ φ λ= −  
where φw is the potential at the wall of the 
microchannel. λD is called the Debye length of the 
electrolyte. It represents the 1/e decay distance for 
the potential as well as the electric field at low 
potentials. y denotes the distance from the wall. For a 
nano size channel, the influence of the 
electro-osmosis induced potential φ on the diffusion 
ions traveling along the channel can not be neglected. 
Therefore, the equivalent impedance of a 
nano-channel is modeled as a series of finite RC 
circuit connections, as shown in Figure 3. The 
capacitor cd and resistor r per unit length in each 
infinitesimal RC circuit denote the impedance of the 
electrical double layer and the buffer solution, 
respectively. 
 
3.2 Ion diffusion induced current  
As depicted in Figure 3, the electric double layer 
induces potential at the nano-channel wall trapping 
cations that travel along the axial direction, resulting 
in a reduction in the ion diffusion current stage by 
stage. The equivalent circuit of an infinitesimal unit 
with a distance x from the inlet of this nano-channel 
is schematically illustrated in Figure 4.  
The time dependent potential gradient and 
diffusion current gradient along the axial direction at 
position x can be described as, 
( ) ( )i i
V t ri t

∂ = −∂  (6) 
( ) ( )i i

Equation (15) indicates that Vi(t) depends only on y.  
When t=0 and x=0, Vi(0)= V1(0) is the initial voltage 
in vessel 1. The constants A1 and B in Equation (15) 
    22
assume that the cations contribute most of the 
diffusion current.  
Figure 9 compares the experimental and 
simulation diffusion currents for the conditions 
c1(0)/c2(0)=2 and 3, 6, respectively. There is only a 
very small deviation between the theoretical and 
experiment data. The validity of the proposed 
diffusion current model through nano-channels can 
be verified. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The diffusion property allows ions to travel from 
higher concentration areas to lower concentration 
areas. When a thin film with porous nano-channels is 
implemented to separate solutions with ion 
concentration gradient, diffusion induced current can 
be detected. 
Diffusion ions traveling along a nano-channel 
are influenced by both the diffusion flux and the 
electric osmosis flux that results from the electrical 
double layer. In this article, a novel model that 
considers both the diffusion and electric osmosis 
effects to describe the diffusion current properties 
through a nano-channel was proposed. The 
equivalent impedance of a nano-channel was 
modeled as a series of finite RC circuit connections. 
The impedance of the electrical double layer that 
causes the electric osmosis flux was represented 
using a capacitor and the buffer solution was 
modeled using a resistor. 
Computer simulations using a nano-porous 
anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) thin film to separate 
solutions with ion concentration gradient were 
conducted. An electrochemical bath that contained 
two vessels separated by AAO thin film was built to 
carry out the experiments.  A high degree of 
coincidence was observed between the theoretical 
and experimental data.

Photosynthesis is arguably the most important 
biochemical pathway that effectively converses light 
energy into chemical energy. Photosynthesis takes 
place in two stages. During the light-dependent stage, 
pigment chlorophyll inside a chloroplast seizes 
energy from sunlight and uses it to produce 
high-energy electrons, hydrogen ions, and oxygen 
through the photolysis process. The high-energy 
electrons ultimately result in the reduction of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
(NADP+) into NADPH. The hydrogen ions create a 
proton gradient across the chloroplast membrane and 
dissipate through adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) 
Synthases to synthesize ATP. During the second 
stage, the Calvin-Benson Cycle uses the high-energy 
molecules to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the 
atmosphere and requires the NADPH and ATP to 
make energy rich carbohydrates such as sucrose, 
glucose and starch. 
In this study we present a novel and very 
simple chloroplastmimic photovoltaics that operates 
based upon a photolysis induced hydrogen ion 
concentration gradient (proton motive force) and is 
able to generate electricity and hydrogen 
simultaneously. The proposed photovoltaic, shown in 
Figure 1, is comprised of three components: a 
water-containing electrochemical bath which acts as 
the photovoltaic body, artificial chlorophyll which is 
used to photolyze water and generates hydrogen ions, 
and an artificial thylakoid membrane which separates 
the bath into two cells to produce the proton motive 
force. 
 
Figure 1. Chloroplastmimic photovoltaics powered 
by the proton motive force 
 
The working principle for the proposed 
photovoltaics is based upon Fick’s law1,2  
cj D

∂= − ∂  (1) 
where j is the molecular flux, D is the diffusion 
coefficient, ∂c/∂x denotes the gradient of the 
molecular concentration. In the well-documented 
process of catalytic photolysis of TiO2, UV light 
irradiation excites electrons (e-) from the valence 
band causing them to migrate to the conduction band, 
generating holes (h+) at edge of the valence band. 
The oxidation of H2O by h+ produces ⋅OH and H+ 3-6

Accumulation of hydrogen ions in one of the two 
cells creates an ion concentration gradient across the 
artificial thylakoid membrane, consequently inducing 
a transmembrane chemiosmotic potential which can 
be formulated as 
1
1 2
2
ln( )cTV V V
q c
κ= − =  (4) 
where c is the ion concentration, V is the 
transmembrane chemiosmotics potential, q is the 
charge on each ion, T is the absolute temperature, κ is 
the Boltzman constant. The result is the photolysis 
induced transport of electrons through the conducting 
wire to the counter electrode on the other side of the 
artificial thylakoid membrane, which generates 
electricity. Simultaneously, the photolysis induced 
hydrogen ions driven by the ion concentration 
gradient diffuse through the artificial thylakoid 
membrane to the counter electrode and combine with 
the electrons to produce hydrogen.

To increase the efficiency of the 
chloroplastmimic photovoltaics process, the flux of 
the hydrogen ions has to be increased. According to 
Fick’s law, the flux of the hydrogen ions can be 
increased by enlarging the magnitudes of the 
transmembrane concentration gradient and/or the 
diffusion coefficient. The transmembrane 
concentration gradient can be raised by enhancing the 
photolytic potency of the photocatalyst, which can be 
achieved by reducing the recombination tendency of 
photoexcited electron-hole pairs and/or extending the 
absorption band of the TiO2 from the UV range (378 
nm) to the visible spectrum7-9. The diffusion 
coefficient can be enlarged by modification of the 
material properties of the artificial thylakoid 
membrane.

density and power of the TiO2/CNT laminated 
photocatalyst that contained 5.65×10-6g of TiO2 were 
8 μA/cm2 and 1 μW, respectively. The efficiency was 
calculated to be 0.001%. The current density can be 
further increased by a photocatalyst that can perform 
better photolysis and/or a larger electrochemical cell 
containing the counter electrode such that the 
concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions can be 
raised.

characteristic of the TiO2/CNT photocatalyst that it 
participates in the reaction but is not consumed in the 
reaction is apparently revealed.
