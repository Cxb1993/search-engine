a-IGZO 全透明薄膜電晶體驅動有機光偵測器
研究

compatibility, the oxide semiconductors, a-IGZO, TFTs 
have gained much attention due to its good uniformity and 
high carrier mobility [5-8]. In this study, we have 
demonstrated the appropriate dielectrics to carry out the 
low voltage a-IGZO TFT. By source/drain electrodes 
selection, the contact resistance is obviously decreased so 
that performance of a-IGZO TFT is significantly 
improved. 
2.  Experimental 
2.1 Deposition and characteristics of IGZO thin film  
The InGaZnO4 target was purchased by Opetch 
Materials Co. Ltd (InGaZnO4 purity: 99.99%, 2 in. 
diameter, In: Ga: Zn=1:1:1 in atomic ratio). The electrical 
properties of thin film would significantly influenced by 
deposition atmosphere and the deposition rate. The oxygen 
partial pressures from 0.1%-0.4% were tested to find out 
the appropriate oxygen partial pressure to deposit a-IGZO 
with semiconductor behavior. For the deposition rate 
discussion, in pure Ar atmosphere, the radio frequency (RF) 
power was adjusted from 20 to 50W to realize the 
relationship between the oxygen vacancy and the 
conducting property. 
For material analysis, each elemental composition (In, 
Ga, and Zn) and binding conditions were analyzed by    
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Transmittance 
was measured by UV-VIS spectrometer and the sheet 
resistance was confirmed by four pint probe. 
2.2 IGZO TFT fabrication 
 The a-IGZO TFT is based on bottom gate and top 
contact structure in this work. The TFT fabrication process 
is as follow. First, the devices were fabricated on heavily 
doped silicon gate or the glass with patterned aluminum 
gate electrode. The sample dimension of silicon wafer was 
about 25×25mm and that of glass was 30×30mm. Then, a 
dielectric layer was formed on the gate electrode. In this 
study, the organic material, poly-(4-vinyl phenol) (PVP), 
and inorganic high-k material, HfOx, were used as 
dielectrics, respectively. The PVP (Mw=25000) purchased 
from Aldrich were prepared as the concentration of 8% in 
the propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) 
with the crosslink agent melamine-co-formaldehyde 
methylated (PMF). The PVP solution was then spin coated 
on the samples and heated at 200oC for 2hour. In the case 
of the high k dielectric, the 80-nm-thick HfOx was 
deposited by RF magnetron sputtering system at room 
temperature and the dielectric constant was about 15. 
Third, the n channel a-IGZO was deposited by RF 
magnetron sputter without substrate heating and the active 
layer region was patterned by the shadow mask. The 
background pressure was around 5×10-6 torr and working 
pressure was set as 10m torr. Finally, 30-nm-thick 
source/drain (S/D) electrodes were patterned through the 
shadow mask. Various S/D electrodes, gold and aluminum, 
were selected to discuss the carrier injection form S/D to 
semiconductor and analysis the contact resistance. The 
ratio of channel length (L) to width (W) was designed as 
1000μm/100μm, 2000μm/200μm, 3000μm/300μm, 
4000μm/400μm, and 5000μm/500μm, respectively. Fig. 1 
shows schematic view of IGZO TFT with aluminum patterned 
gate and photograph of the practical device on heavily doped 
silicon. All of the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of 
the a-IGZO TFT were measured by an HP 4145A 
semiconductor analyzer in the dark and ambient 
environment. 
3.  Results and discussion 
3.1  a-IGZO thin film analysis 
Fig. 2 shows the optical transmittance of a-IGZO film 
deposited by pure Ar process gas during the sputtering. In

Owing to high gate leakage current, the performance 
of a-IGZO TFFs with PVP dielectric are limited. The large 
leakage current comes from overlap area between gate and 
S/D. Because the PVP dielectric is a robust dielectric used 
in thermal evaporated pentacene OTFT, the leakage is 
attributed to the PVP suffering the plasma damage. The 
damaged PVP possibly provide a rough surface, resulting 
in the poor subthreshold swing and on/off current ratio. In 
order to further investigate the damage of plasma, the PVP 
dielectric is exposure to different plasma condition and 
leakage current with metal/insulator/metal (MIM) structure 
is measured. Fig. 7 shows leakage curve of each plasma 
treated PVP dielectrics. After the PVP damaged by Ar and 
O2 mix plasma, the leakage current is as high as 10-3 A/cm2 
in the electrical field of 450kV. The plasma generated by 
Ar and O2 mix gas would seriously damage the PVP 
dielectric. 
3.2.2 Performance of TFT based on HfOx dielectric 
Because high leakage current is observed from PVP 
damaged by Ar and O2 mixed plasma, the pure Ar as 
process gas is preferred to deposit a-IGZO channel. In 
order to optimize a-IGZO TFT performance, the leakage 
current and unstable interface property of damaged PVP 
should be excluded. Inorganic dielectric is more stable 
than organic dielectric in the plasma condition. High-k 
material, HfOx, is used as dielectric layer to develop 
reliable a-IGZO TFT. 
 Fig. 8(a) shows the a-IGZO transfer curves with 
various a-IGZO thicknesses. It is obvious that the 
subthreshold swing and threshold voltage are correlated 
with the IGZO thickness from 40 nm to 100nm. The 
increasing IGZO channel thickness shifts the Vth toward 
more negative value. The amount of free carrier in bulk 
IGZO would affect the channel behavior. An increasing off 
current is discovered in thicker channel such as 
100-nm-thick IGZO. Above channel thickness of 57 nm, 
the off current is around 10-10 A, and it increases one order 
comparing to 40-nm-thick IGZO. The total carriers are 
increased based on thicker IGZO, so that charge would 
easily flow toward the drain without passing through the 
accumulated channel. In order to obtain desired lower 
off-state current, the thickness of active layer should be 
controlled below 50 nm and follow to improve to on/off 
current ratio. 
    Fig. 8(b) shows Vth versus IGZO deposition time 
(correlated to IGZO thickness). The Vth decreases from 3.8 
V to 0.62 V with increasing the a-IGZO thickness from 40 
to 100nm. Table 3 summarizes the performance of TFTs 
with various channel thickness. Form 40nm to 100nm, the 
extracted mobility is in a range of 0.1-0.2 cm2/Vs and no 
obvious difference on mobility is observed. 
Fig. 9 shows the Id-Vd and Id-Vg curve of IGZO TFT 
with RF power of 30w. The gate leakage is in an 
acceptable range of 10-10-10-11 A, excluding insulator 
suffering damage from plasma process. Under the pure Ar 
sputtering environment, the performance of TFTs with 
various IGZO deposition power is listed in Table 4. The 
Vth is about 2~3 V in the range of 30~60 w. All devices 
show the off current about 10-12 A. and the SS is about 
0.3~0.4 V/dec. According to results of Fig. 8, decreasing 
the thickness of a-IGZO significantly suppresses the off 
current. For the similar IGZO thickness, the RF power 
would play one of important roles to develop a high 
performance TFT. The carrier mobility would dominate the 
on/off current ratio. Among those conditions, IGZO 
deposited by power of the 30w exhibits a relatively high 
performance. The mobility is 0.36 cm2/Vs and on/off 
current ratio is as high as 4×106.

國科會補助專題研究計畫項下出席國際學術會議心得報告 
                                     日期：99 年 7 月 20 日 
一、 參加會議經過 
Thin film 2010 於 7/11~7/14 於中國哈爾濱召開。我們搭乘 7/9 中國南方航空班機，從
桃園國際機場出發。因為會議時間為暑假，直飛機位極難定到，所以當晚經過上海
轉機。在上海時，驚訝于浦東機場的現代與宏偉。桃園機場相形之下有些老舊。但
是，若從軟體來論，桃園機場的安排與服務皆比浦東機場來的好。這從我們當天從
上海飛哈爾濱的班機延遲三小時，而無人知道原因，就可見一斑。終於，在接近午
夜時，飛機抵達並起飛，到達哈爾濱時，已經是 7/10 凌晨快四點了。還好，會議是
在隔天召開，否則將會無法參加。當天略是休息後，7/11 早上前往哈爾濱工業大學
