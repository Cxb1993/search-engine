In this section, we evaluate the design 
considerations for bulk MOSFETs on device 
characteristics and later compare them with 
those of nanowire FETs based on the same 
methodology. The basic bulk nMOSFET 
structure used in TCAD simulation [4] is shown 
in Fig. 1 where the transistor has gate length of 
0.13 μm, electrical (equivalent) gate oxide (tox) 
of 3 nm, and metallurgical channel length (L) of 
90 nm, and the source and drain dopings contain 
shallow extensions with a junction depth of 50 
nm. The physical models following the 
Fermi-Dirac statistics and drift-diffusion 
transport with modified local density 
approximation for carrier confinement were 
included [4]. Fig. 2 shows the tox-Wdm design 
plane [3] of bulk MOSFETs. Tradeoff among the 
various factors such as SCE’s, SS, and critical 
oxide-field of gate leakage can be made within 
the design window of dimensional parameters. 
Wdm impact of bulk MOSFET complicates 
doping profile for SCE control whereas the 
nanowire diameter has a similar effect but at far 
different extent. According to the following 
limitation for acceptable SCEs [3]: 
2min ≈
dmmW
L        (1) 
where 
 dmoxoxdm WtCCm /31/1 +=+= ,    (2) 
Lmin is minimum metallurgical channel length, 
Wdm is channel depletion width, m is the 
body-effect coefficient, Cdm is capacitance of 
Wdm, and Cox is gate oxide capacitance. In Fig. 2, 
the SCE boundary is limited by the 
drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect. 
Furthermore, the SS can be approximated by  
)/1(3.23.2 oxdm CCkTmkTSS +==     (3) 
where T is temperature and k is Boltzmann 
constant. Fig. 3 shows the simulated DIBL vs. 
channel doping for bulk MOSFETs with same tox, 
implying Wdm dependence as Wdm is set by 
doping. Higher doping (or thinner Wdm) shows 
lower DIBL, which allows thicker tox, as 
illustrated by the SCE boundary in Fig. 2. Fig. 4 
shows the simulated SS vs. channel doping for 
bulk MOSFETs with same tox. where SS is 
extracted from the subthreshold slope between 
100 mV and 300 mV below threshold voltage. 
As can be seen, higher SS is predicted with 
reduced Wdm when channel doping increases. 
V. Design Considerations for Nanowire 
FETs 
Following the same methodology for bulk 
MOSFETs, we investigate the design window 
for nanowire transistors. The nanowire 
nMOSFET structure used in 3D TCAD 
simulation is shown in Fig. 5 where the 
transistor has a nominal diameter (D) of 9 nm, 
metallurgical channel length of 18 nm, gate 
oxide of 0.65 nm, and buried oxide of 200 nm 
following the ITRS roadmap [1]. In contrast to 
the bulk case, the channel is assumed undoped. 
To meet the off leakage current (Ioff) constraint 
in accordance with technology roadmap, the 
workfunction of metal-gate is adjusted. Physics 
models used in simulation are same as those for 
bulk MOSFETs. Here, the specifications for SS 
and DIBL are defined as 100 mV/decade and 
DIBL 100 mV/V, respectively, which are the 
usual acceptable limitations. Fig. 6 shows the 
simulated DIBL vs. diameter for nanowire 
transistors with the matched tox. Every case of 
D’s requires a different tox in order to meet the 
targeted DIBL of 100 mV/V. The case with D of 
18 nm, showing poor DIBL, has to be eliminated 
for which the ultimate limit of tox of 2.5 Å is 
already reached. Fig. 7 shows the simulated SS

Assessment of Novel Phase Change Memory 
Programming Techniques

 Abstract –In this paper, we present novel phase 
change memory programming techniques achieving 
low power operation without compromising 
performance by using proper pulsing schemes. By 
applying continuous current pulses at a fixed 
frequency or with the same pulse magnitude, binary 
data are successfully written into memory cells. The 
proposed programming techniques can be 
implemented with more flexible or simplified 
circuitry since a single current level is shown to be 
sufficient for write operations of both set and reset 
states. 
Index terms－Phase change memory, non-volatile memory  
I. INTRODUCTION 
Due to high scalability, fast read/write speed, good 
reliability and low power consumption, phase change 
memory (PCM) has shown its great potential among 
emerging non-volatile memory technologies. The main 
material of PCM component is based on Ge2Sb2Te5 
(GST). Relying on the unique GST characteristics, PCM 
has two stable phases of crystalline (set) and amorphous 
(reset) states, which represent low and high resistances, 
respectively, and thus a binary behavior. 
Fig. 1 shows a typical PCM cell structure and an 
example of PCM resistance versus operation current (R-I) 
characteristics [1]. In this example, for initial set 
condition with low resistance, the PCM does not change 
its state until the current is higher than 700 μA. The 
temperature in the active region of GST could be raised 
by Joule heating from the applied current. When the 
temperature goes above the melting point, the PCM 
rapidly changes to amorphous state and exhibits high 
resistance. As shown in Fig. 1, for current higher than 
1200 μA, the PCM becomes completely amorphous with 
much higher resistance. On the other hand, for initial 
reset condition with high resistance, the PCM could 
become crystallized as the current reaches 700 μA. 
Relying on the physical relationship of lattice 
mechanism and electrical characteristics, the PCM 
provides a non-volatile switching behavior for memory 
application with binary data programmed by the heating 
process. As Joule heating is required for writing data in 
the memory cells, it is essential to limit the power 
consumption, especially for low power application. This 
paper is aimed to propose a novel and yet feasible low 
power operation approach. Useful design optimization 
regarding power and speed is also included.

PCM [1]. 
II. CONVENTIONAL PCM OPERATION 
Fig. 2 shows the temperature change in time for 
different amorphizing and crystallizing pulses. Certain 
finite heating time is needed to complete the process, 
especially for set operation as the crystallization process 
is relatively slower. According to the R-I characteristics 
in Fig. 1, one can apply one single current pulse (1.2 mA) 
to a PCM cell to write the reset state following the 
conventional PCM programming operation. In this case, 
as shown in Fig. 2, the temperature should be raised to at 
least the melting point (600°C) where the material 
becomes amorphous and exhibits high resistance. On the 
other hand, for set operation, a different single current 
pulse (0.7 mA) is applied. When the temperature falls 
between glass transition temperature (300°C) and 
melting point (600°C), the material is continuously 
crystallized and it shows lower resistance. 
Figs. 3 and 4 show the traditional programming 
pulses, simulated with a compact PCM model [2] which

B. Same Current Magnitude Pulsing 
 
In contrast to the same frequency operation, here we 
assess the current pulsing of write operation with the 
same magnitude. As shown in Figs. 9 and 11, after six 
and one pulse cycles with 50% duty cycle, the cell is 
converted to set and reset states from its initial reset and 
set states, respectively. Again, since the temperature in 
the PCM cell is kept above the glass transition 
temperature and continuously facilitates the lattice 
transition process, as shown in Figs. 10 and 12, the 
operation power can be efficiently managed by using 
proper pulsing criteria. In this example, the energies for 
set and reset transitions are 51 pJ and 17 pJ, respectively. 
It is worth mentioning that the same current source, 
usually a current mirror, would be sufficient for this 
scheme, implying design simplicity.
