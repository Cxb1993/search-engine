mild S/N conditions and is robust even in low 
S/N environments by computer simulations. This 
is because, as we will see, there is only one 
coefficient for updating and the stability can be 
straightforwardly controlled. The system 
configuration for IF band BFSK demodulation is 
illustrated in section III. The simulations and 
comparisons results using computer and DSP’s 
are demonstrated in section IV.

2. BFSK demodulation using AOSC-LMS 
adaptive algorithm 
The AOSC-LMS adaptive algorithm is derived 
from the concept of the active digital oscillator 
[6], where three consecutive samples are 
mutually related by a one-coefficient

Hence, the coefficient, 　 0, determines the 
frequency of the sinusoidal signal generated. 
Based on the concept of eq. (1) and a constrained 
minimization criterion, the AOSC-LMS 
algorithm can be derived. Together with a 
narrow-band IIR bandpass filter (BPF), as shown 
in Fig. 2, the AOSC-LMS adaptive

where 　(n) is the coefficient updated, yp(n) is 
the reference signal generated by the IIR BPF, 
　 is the step-size, and P_x(n) is the estimated 
input power. The frequency of the input 
sinusoidal 　o can be estimated, according to eq. 
(2), via the equality, 
 0ωˆ =cos-1(　(n)/2), 
for n large or when the adaptive algorithm 
converges. In FSK demodulation practice, the 
determination of 0ωˆ  via 　(n) can be achieved 
through a decision device and a look-up table. 
In the following computer simulations, the 
AOSC-LMS adaptive algorithm is adopted, as 
shown in Fig. 2, to estimate the frequency of a 
sinusoid corrupted by Gaussian white noise with 
zero-mean. The IIR BPF has the transfer 
function

process.

3. Simulations 
  In this section, we evaluate the performances 
of BFSK demodulation using AOSC-LMS 
adaptive algorithm conducted with digital signal 
processor (TMS320C6711 DSP’s [8]) for time 
required in frequency detection and with 
computer simulations for BER. We also compare 
the proposed configuration with the conventional 
DPLL as shown in Fig. 2. The S/N environments 
are set to be S/N = 5dB, 10dB, and 20dB, 
sampling rate = 48kHz, and f0 = 1KHz (　0 = 
0.04671　). Figs. 5(a), (b) and (c) depict the 
convergence curves using ASOC-LMS adaptive 
algorithm all with 　  = 0.9 and 　  = 0.05 
implemented by DSP’s. Fig. 6(a), (b) and (c) 
depict the convergence curves using DPLL 
implemented by DSP’s. Comparing with Fig. 5 
and Fig. 6, we can see that the convergence rates 
using ASOC-LMS adaptive algorithm are all 
about 4-time faster than the ones using DPLL for 
various S/N’s. The results show that the use of 
AOSC-LMS adaptive algorithm for frequency 
detection has better performances in 
convergence time than the use of DPLL. The 
computer simulations for BER comparison 
between the ASOC-LMS adaptive algorithm and 
DPLL are shown in Fig. 7, where 10000 
randomly generated symbols are fed to
