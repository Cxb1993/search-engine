ABSTRACT 
An improved procedure was developed involving a stirred fluidized bed (SFB) adsorption for 
direct recovery of recombinant enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) from unclarified E. 
coli homogenates. The maximal binding capacity of STREAMLINE DEAE adsorbent for EGFP 
was observed at pH 9. A typical adsorption isotherm curve for EGFP in a crude E. coli 
homogenate was well correlated with the Langmuir model. The maximal binding capacity for 
EGFP and dissociation constant for EGFP-adsorbent complex were 6.3mg/ ml and 1.3x10-3 mg/ 
ml respectively. Optimal conditions for elution scheme were further determined in small packed 
bed experiments conducted with clarified E.coli homogenate under the various operating 
conditions. The recovery yield for the EGFP was approximately 93% by using 0.2 M NaCl (pH 9) 
and 10 fold adsorbent volumes at liquid velocity of 200 cm/h. The operating conditions were 
chosen for use in further purification process. Finally, the experiments were carried out to assess 
the feasibility of using SFB chromatography for direct recovery of EGFP from different loading 
volumes (50-200 ml) of highly crude E.coli homogenate (pH 9). It was found to be successful in 
achieving purification of EGFP in a high yield of 95-98% and the purification factor was approx. 
3 in a single step under these loading volumes of E. coli homogenates at a rotating speed of 200 
rpm.

4.2 等溫吸附之探討 
    等溫吸附曲線常被用來作為吸附行為之指標，本實驗利用批次法在相同溫度下 
(4℃)，與 DEAE 樹脂進行吸附反應 3 小時，接著在應用 Langmuir 方程式即可求得樹
脂最大吸附量 (qm) 及樹脂與蛋白質複合物的解離常數 (Kd) (Skidmore et al., 1990)，樹脂
對於 EGFP 最大吸附量與解離常數分別為 6.3 mg/ml 及 1.3x10-3 mg/ml，對於總量蛋白質
最大吸附量與解離常數分別為 39.63 mg/ml 及 0.52 mg/ml。而解離常數的數值亦可表示樹
脂與蛋白質複合物間鍵結強度的大小，解離常數值愈小，樹脂與蛋白質複合物間的鍵結
強度、親合力愈大，由此可得知樹脂對 EGFP 之鍵結強度與親合力較總量蛋白質好。 
 
4.4 吸附速率之探討 
    本實驗主要探討樹脂對酵素吸附速率之影響，吸附速率的快慢，會影響平衡所需之時
間。發現在未澄清與澄清的細胞破碎溶液中，樹脂對 EGFP 與總量蛋白質的吸附效
率之變化是相似的，在吸附反應進行至 60 分鐘左右，系統漸趨於平衡，平衡時 EGFP 
與總量蛋白質的吸附值分別為 0.8191 mg/ml 與 0.5441 mg/ml，由此即可得知細胞破
碎後的細胞渣及其他雜質，對樹脂的吸附速率是不受影響的。 
 
4.6 沖提條件的選擇 
    本研究目的是尋找最適沖提的條件，將被吸附之 EGFP (20 mM 甘胺酸緩衝溶液
pH 9.0)從樹脂中完全脫附下來。實驗探討的範圍涵蓋：氯化鈉鹽類溶液鹽類濃度之
效應、沖提溶液之體積與流速之效應。實驗結果得知在 10 ml (10 倍管柱體積)之沖
提體積，EGFP 的脫附量可達 100%，而雜蛋白鍵結能力較 EGFP 強，因此在使用 0.2 
M NaCl 20 mM 甘胺酸緩衝溶液(pH 9.0)，30 ml (30 倍管柱體積)之沖提體積，總量

An improved process for direct recovery of lysozyme  
by stirred fluidized bed technique  
Yu-Kaung Chang, Shin-Ying Chou（學生） 
Center for Biochemical Engineering, Graduate School of Biochemical Engineering, 
Mingchi University of Technology, Taipei 24301, Taiwan 
 
Abstract 
An improved process has been developed by using a stirred fluidized bed (SFB) technique 
for direct recovery of lysozyme from homogenized fresh chicken egg white (CEW). A 
macro-porous mixed mode adsorbent (STREAMLINE Direct HST, av. 135 μm 1.80 g/cm3) 
selected was based on a highly cross-linked agarose with multi-model functional groups. The 
matrix contains stainless steel particles to provide the required high density for use in highly 
crude viscous and conductive feedstock. The results showed that it was very successful in 
achieving purification of lysozyme in a high yield of 94.30% with a purification factor of 
15.72 in a single step. The specific activity (2.28x106 U/mg) was higher than that obtained 
with a commercially available pure sample of lysozyme (Sigma, 7.30x104 U/mg). 
1. Introduction 
Chicken egg white (CEW) is a mixture of proteins and has been routinely used for the 
purification of lysozyme. Among the proteins in egg whites, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin 
(conalbumin), and ovomucoid are the major components constituting 54%, 12-13%, and 11%, 
respectively, with lysozyme as a minor component of about 3.5%1. Lysozyme is a 
commercially valuable enzyme, which has tremendous potential for application in 
pharmaceutical and food industries2. Commercially available purified lysozyme is 
manufactured using a combination of conventional purification processes. Traditional packed 
bed purification process requires multiple operation steps, such as dilution of egg white, 
filtration and centrifugation for the removal of solid particulates before crude CEW could be 
applied to the packed bed column2-4. In this paper, the adsorption performance for lysozyme 
in crude viscous fresh CEW was compared under various rotating speeds of agitator (0-200 
rpm) in SFB column. Moreover, the yield, purity, and activity of the separated lysozyme 
fractions were also investigated.

of the adsorbent estimated was much higher at 200 rpm as compared to 0-150 rpm. Hence, as 
the rotating speed increased, a larger volume of CEW feedstock could be loaded onto the 
column and a higher percentage of lysozyme was adsorbed under the same operating 
conditions.

3.2 Direct recovery of lysozyme by SFB column 
As described above, appropriate operating conditions for the recovery of lysozyme have 
been established from the experimental results of dynamic adsorption curves. In a stirred 
fluidized bed column, the rotating speed of agitator was maintained at 200 rpm. Two pump 
systems were used to control the superficial velocity of buffer and crude CEW, respectively 
and operated to deliver the two liquids at the same velocity of 150 cm/h. Therefore, the 
overall superficial velocity was 300 cm/h. During experiments, the settled bed height was 
fixed at 20 cm and all operating steps (adsorption, washing, and elution stages) were carried 
out in fluidized bed mode only. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The samples of contaminating 
protein and lysozyme were collected in each stage and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as shown in 
Fig. 5. During adsorption stage, the front of the process liquid in the stabilized zone was 
observed in the upper part of the column. The well-mixed zone was approached to 15% in 
fluidized bed. The degree of removal of general protein during the adsorption and washing 
stages was as high as 95.54%, whereas the loss of lysozyme activity during these stages was 
only 5.98%. After washing, 40 mM sodium carbonate buffer in 0.5 M NaCl (pH 12) was 
found to elute 94.30% of bound lysozyme with an average purification factor of 15.72. The 
results shown in Table 1 indicated that a 15.72-fold purification of the lysozyme was achieved 
in a high yield of 94.30%, the specific activity 2.28x106 U/mg was higher than that obtained 
with a commercially available pure sample of lysozyme (Sigma, 7.30x104 U/mg). The 
purification efficiency was considerably higher than that of a traditional fluidized bed column 
when operated with highly crude feedstocks in the presence of large sized solid particulates.

Rapid purification of enhanced green fluorescent protein from 
unclarified Escherichia coli feedstock

Abstract 
A rapid purification was developed involving a stirred fluidized bed (SFB) adsorption for 
direct recovery of recombinant enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) from unclarified E. 
coli homogenate. Optimal conditions for adsorption and elution processes were determined in 
small packed bed experiments conducted with clarified E.coli homogenate under various 
operating conditions. The experiments were further carried out to assess the feasibility of 
using SFB chromatography for direct recovery of EGFP from different loading volumes 
(50-200 ml) of highly crude E.coli homogenate. As compared to other purification techniques 
for EGFP, it was found to be very successful in achieving purification of EGFP in a high yield 
of 95-98% and the purification factor was approximately 3 folds in a single step under the 
loading volumes of E. coli homogenate at rotating speed of 200 rpm.  
1. Introduction 
The green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been widely used as a fluorescent label in cellular 
biology1-5. The fluorescent properties of wild-type GFP have been further improved by 
genetic engineering, especially enhanced GFP (EGFP). The EGFP has a red-shifted excitation 
spectrum (480-500 nm) and an emitted fluorescence (507-511 nm), 35-fold brighter than 
wild-type GFP1-5. For application of expanded bed adsorption (EBA) process, STREAMLINE 
column (i.d. 2.5 cm) has been commonly used in the purification of EGFP from unclarified E. 
coli feedstock1. However, the operating velocity, viscosity and biomass of the unclarifies 
feedstocks in the column often limit its use as a result of the trapping of particulates under the 
 10
2.3 Protein determination and EGFP assay  
The total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method using BSA as the 
standard. All data represented are the mean value of triplicate measurements, where the 
standard deviation was within 5% of the mean value. The active EGFP content was measured 
by fluorescence at 512 (with excitation at 490 nm) on a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorometer. A 
curve of reference of relative fluorescence units versus quantity of pure EGFP was used to 
determine the quantity of EGFP in samples1. 
 
2.4 Direct capture of EGFP using SFB column  
Disrupted cell homogenate (50%, w/v) was used in this work. In these experiments, two 
peristaltic pumps were used in the SFB operating systems. Pump A was used to pump the 
buffer (20 mM NaOH-glycine buffer, pH 9), and pump B was used to pump the 50% (w/v) 
unclarified cell homogenate (pH 9) onto the column through an inlet valve above the support 
net. The adsorption performance of the SFB column at rotating speed of 200 rpm was 
compared under different loading volumes (50-200 ml) of unclarified feedstock at liquid 
velocity of 236 cm/h (118 cm/h for each pump). In order to allow free passage of solid 
particulates, the top adaptor was used in the column without a mesh cap. The adsorbent was 
poured into the column to give a settled bed height and the top adaptor of the column was 
positioned near the top surface of the fluidized bed. When the stabilized fluidized bed was 
observed in the upper part of the column, the stirrer was switched on and the rotating speed 
was controlled at 200 rpm. The pump A was then switched to crude solution delivery (50-200 
ml). All the runs were terminated after the outlet concentration of EGFP had reached 
approximately CA/CAo= 0.01. After adsorption and washing stages, 0.2 M NaCl in 20 mM 
NaOH-glycine buffer (pH 9) was used as an eluent at liquid velocity of 200 cm/h. Fractions 
were collected throughout the experiment and assayed for the concentration of general protein 
and EGFP.

100, or 200 ml, pH 9) was loaded directly onto the stirred fluidized bed adsorption column at 
rotating speed of 200 rpm and overall liquid velocity of 236 cm/h (118 cm/h for each pump). 
The liquid velocity was maintained during the adsorption stage and the top surface of the 
fluidized bed could be observed even in the presence of turbid particulate materials. We 
observed that the fluidized bed remained stable when the unclarified feedstock was applied to 
the adsorbent bed and there was no backing mixing and liquid channels present in the column, 
except for the bottom of colum with well-mixed zone near the agitator. After washing of the 
fluidized bed with glycerol and buffer, the adsorbed EGFP was eluted from the adsorbent in a 
fluidized mode. The elution step was used at a constant velocity of 200 cm/h. The 
experimental results for loading volumes of 50 and 200 ml are given in Tables 1-2 and Figs. 
1-2. In all cases, we observed that a loss of EGFP (1.08-4.70%) was low in the flow through 
fractions under loading volumes. Hence, yield results showed that the presence of 95-98% of 
EGFP for each purification process in a single step.

4. Conclusion 
As compared with conventional expanded bed adsorption columns used in the purification of 
EGFP under the similar operating conditions1, the newly designed stirred fluidized bed column 
was effectively operated with highly crude and viscous cell homogenate. It was shown to be 
very successful for direct recovery of EGFP in a high yield of 95-98% with a purification factor 
of 2.5-2.9 in a single step.
