Abstract: 
A series of plane strain model tests on 
geogrid reinforced soil wall with vertical 
wrapped-around facing was conducted. The 
dimensions of the model wall were 1.2m 
(height) × 0.8 (depth) × 2 m (width). Two types 
of granular soils with their D50 respectively 
equal to 5.2 mm, and 0.4 mm were used. The 
adopted reinforcements were polyester geogrid 
having different stiffness. Test results showed 
that the peak vertical stress and the relevant 
vertical displacements of footing increased with 
increase in soil particle sizes. The failure plane 
became distinct after the occurrence of peak 
strength and the thickness of failure plane and 
the area of influenced zone increased with an 
increase in soil particle size. Test results 
showed that reinforcement stiffness has a 
significant effect on the peak strength and the 
horizontal displacement of facing.

A vertical wrapped-around facing 
composed of soil bags was used for all model 
walls. A rigid steel footing, 30 cm wide and 70 
cm deep, was rested at a distance of 68 cm 
from the outward margin of facing. In testing, 
the monotonic vertical load with a rate of 0.02 
mm/sec was applied by an MTS actuator 
(Model 244.31) with 250 kN load capacity and 
500 mm maximum stroke. Except to the 
vertical load and displacement of footing, the 
horizontal displacements of the wall facing 
were measured by linear variable displacement 
transformer (LVDT) at four locations as shown 
in Fig. 3. Three layers of geogrid were placed 
in all GRS model walls. The wrapped-around 
length of facing is equal to 35 cm. 
 
For observing the shear zone patterns, as 
that shown in Fig. 4, the inside of front 
transparent acryl plates were attached with nine 
sheets of latex rubber membranes printed with 
marked grid points. The spacing between each 
grid point is 20 mm. The photos of these 
deformed patterns of membranes were taken 
and a photogrametric method was adopted to 
analyze the corresponding maximum shear 
strains of the backfills. It should be noted that 
only the area denoted as zone ABCD in Figs. 3 
and 4 was observed. 
 
TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Load-settlement behavior 
 
Fig.5 compares the relationships between 
vertical stress (qv) and settlement (δ) of the 
footing resting on the crest of model wall 
backfilled with sand. The following trends of 
behaviour can be seen from Fig. 5: 
 
(a) At the initial stage of qv versu δ curve with 
the settlement less than 5 mm, the 
difference between the curve of 
unreinforced one and those of reinforced 
cases are negligible. The above result 
indicated that the tensile forces of geogrids 
were not fully mobilized at this stage. 
 
(b) The peak vertical stress of footing (or 
so-called the ultimate bearing capacity, qult) 
increased with the increasing of 
reinforcement stiffness. For example, the 
qult of Test19 reinforced with the strongest 
type of geogrid R3 became higher by a 
factor of 2.24 than the value of 
unreinforced one (Test26). For reinforced 
case, the larger qult the larger required 
settlement of footing to attain its 
corresponding peak state. 
 
(c) The stiffness or the nominal strength of 
geogrid has a discernable effect on the 
reduction of vertical stress after peak state. 
It is interesting to note that among the three 
reinforced cases, Test21 reinforced with the 
most flexible geogrid R1 has the gentlest 
trend of the reduction on the vertical 
footing stress. Besides, the vertical footing 
stress of Test21 at larger settlement also 
became the largest. The above result may 
indicate that the deformation compatibility 
between geogrid and surrounding sand 
become better when a more flexible geogrid 
is used. 
 
Fig. 6 presents the relationships between 
vertical stress (qv) and settlement (δ) of the 
footing on the model wall backfilled with 
gravel. Due to the limited vertical load capacity 
of apparatus, Test24 could be only performed 
to an extent of the settlement around 45 mm. 
The following features of behaviour can be 
seen from Fig. 6: 
(a) To the extent that the tests can be 
performed, Test24 has the largest vertical 
footing stress qv at a given settlement of 
footing compared to other tests. The above 
result indicates that for the tested gravel, 
Geogrid R3 can provide the best reinforcing 
effect. 
(b) For Test 20 and Test22 which were 
respectively reinforced with Geogrid R1 
and R2, the differences between their qv vs. 
δ  curves are not as large as their 
companion tests (Test21 and Test23) in 
GRS wall with sand. It is also found that 
the qult of Test22 became higher by a factor 
of 4.14 than the value of unreinforced one 
 6
when a large footing settlement is attained. As 
that can be seen in Figs. 15 to 17, δH of GRS 
wall becomes smaller than that of unreinforced 
one. Figs. 18 to 21 show the horizontal 
displacement of facing (δH) of GRS walls with 
gravel. In Fig. 18, it can be found that the 
horizontal displacement of unreinforced gravel 
has a larger value than that of unreinforced 
sand at the same footing settlement. At the 
settlement o footing less than 40 mm, as shown 
in Figs. 19 to 21, the horizontal displacement of 
facing in GRS gravel wall decreases with 
increasing reinforcement stiffness. However, 
the above phenomenon, as yet unexplained, is 
not consistent in GRS wall with sand. This 
controversy reveals the complexity of 
reinforcement-soil interaction which may 
depends on the combination of soil particle size 
and reinforcement stiffness. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
This study employed model tests with 
vertical wrapped-around facing and granular 
backfill to examine the behavior of GRS wall, 
including the load-settlement relationships, the 
shear zone pattern and the lateral deformation 
of facing. Some preliminary observations can 
be made as follows: 
 
(a) Using the same type of geogrid in granular 
backfill, it is found that the larger soil 
particle size the larger reinforcing effect on 
ultimate bearing capacity in GRS wall. Due 
to the so-called particle size effects, the 
required settlement of footing to achieve 
the ultimate bearing capacity increases with 
the increasing of soil particle size. 
(b) The reinforcement stiffness does have a 
significant effect on the lateral deformation 
of facing, the ultimate and residual bearing 
capacity of footing. It should be noted that 
for the same type of geogrid but employed 
in the backfills with different particle sizes, 
there may be different reinforcing effect in 
GRS model wall due to the complexity of 
geogrid-soil interaction in granular soil.
