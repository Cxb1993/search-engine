中英文摘要 
Previous studies on information processing in schizophrenia consistently revealed several of 
cognitive deficits. These cognitive deficits may serve as candidate endophenotype markers for 
identifying the susceptibility genes of schizophrenia. However, The reliability of some cognitive 
measurements had been criticized since the schizophrenia patients with negative symptoms usually 
did not have strong motivation to cooperate with such attention-dependent tests. Therefore, the role 
of preattentional cognition such as P50, Prepulse inhibition (PPI) and Mismatch Negativity (MMN) 
is important in schizophrenia research.  
 Past research publications of the event-related potential P50 with the subjects’ eyes closed are 
prone to increase in slow frequency eye movements (due to lack of visual reference) and alpha 
activity (due to reduced visual input); in contrast, those with both eyes fixed on a distant spot 
sometimes produce a lot of eye blinks and eye movement which will not be cancelled by ERP 
averaging and may seriously interfere with correct ERP analysis and interpretation. Both the above 
condition made the signal processing procedure sophisticated. Because most MMN paradigm used 
passive conditions in which the subject’s or patient’s attention is directed elsewhere such as to an 
interesting silenced video, it is important whether P50 recording will be better during watching 
videos in order to keep subject awake and prevent their eyes movements. 
 The present study is conducted to clarify the effect of watching videos on the P50. Normal 
hearing subjects with no major psychiatric diagnosis will received P50 eye-opening /P50 watching 
silenced video sessions. Pairs of auditory clicks will be presented every 8–12 seconds, with a 500 
msec interclick interval in both sessions. The stimuli will be generated by and data will be recorded 
by Neuroscan STIM and ACQUIRE system. By comparing the P50 differences between 
eye-opening and watching video, we will develop a brand new technique examining the P50 
event-related potential, which is much more easier both for the subjects(not to fall asleep or looking 
around) and the researchers(less time of processing ERP artifacts).  
31 subjects were recruited, and 24 with 2 successful-recording sessions were analyzed. Under 
initial analysis, the duration of the second session (P50 silenced video ) was similar or shorter than 
the first session. While the P50 suppression was similar. Further analysis will be conduct to evaluate 
the amount of eye blink artifact in the first vs. second session. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide new insight of using this easier method 
(watching videos) of acquiring P50 in future research of schizophrenia patients.

Participants 
 30 subjects with no major psychiatric diagnosis history will be recruited. Detailed evaluations 
are arranged to rule out any major medical problems, psychiatric diagnosis and substance use 
history. All subjects are required to be free from unnecessary medications for at least 2 weeks prior 
to the study and neurologically normal (no history of seizure or head injury). All subjects are 
required to be right-handed for homogeneity. Besides, audiometry over 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 6000 
Hz will be screened to rule out hearing impairment subjects. 
Experimental design  
 Participants will be wearing earphones with acoustic startle stimuli presenting to subjects 
binaurally in a sound-attenuating, electrically shielded booth. Each participant will be seated in a 
comfortable recliner and instructed to relax with his/her eyes open and to focus on a fixation point 
or the video monitor. Pairs of auditory clicks were presented every 8–12 seconds, with a 500-msec 
interclick interval. The stimuli were generated by and data was recorded by Neuroscan [Neuroscan, 
El Paso, Tex.] STIM and ACQUIRE system. Electrodes are used at 32 recording sites (according to 
International 10-20 system) utilizing an electrode cap (Neuroscan, Inc.). Eye movements and blinks 
were monitored with electro-oculographic (EOG) recording: Vertical EOG data were recorded from 
electrodes placed above and below the right eye, and horizontal EOG data were recorded from 
electrodes placed at the outer canthus of each eye. The electrode resistances will be less than 5 
KOhms. The evoked responses were amplified with a band pass of 0.5 to 100 Hz, with no 60-Hz 
notch filter. 
 Each subject has two sessions, while each session must contain at least 120 accepted trials 
(Before baseline correction, single-trials were corrected for eye blink and eye movement artifacts 
based on correlations between electroencephalograms recorded at forehead electrodes and vertical 
EOG, and trials containing artifacts were not accepted by Neuroscan Acquire software). However, 
even if the subject presents a lot of rejected trials, the maximal duration of each session is 40 
minutes. Subjects received P50 eye-opening session first, followed by P50 watching silenced video 
session. The video is used for the display of ‘silent’ cartoons (since the subject is wearing earphone 
to hear the “clicks”). During the testing the subject was monitored visually and by EEG for signs of 
sleep or slow wave activity, which, if present, prompted the experimenter to speak briefly with the 
subject.  
Data Processing  
 The CNT files were highpass-filtered first, and followed by ocular artifact reduction (Ford et 
al 2004) designed by Neuroscan Edit software. Artifact-free epochs are averaged and digitally band 
pass-filtered (10-50 Hz) in the frequency domain using the. P50 amplitude was defined as the 
absolute difference between the P50 peak and the preceding negative trough(Nagamoto et al 1989). 
The percentage of P50suppression was calculated by using the following formula: (1 –[second click
