2.1 Relationship between Clamp-up Torque and 
Axial Force 
According to Chen and Kung [7]， the effective 
diameter for a V-type screw thread was used as the pitch 
diameter dp then the relation between the axial force Fb 
and the clamp-up torque Tj can be obtained as: 
 )'tan(21 βρ += pbj dFT                  (1)

　 　 　 ρμ tans =                               (3) 
Where α´ is the half-angle of thread normal section, β 
is the pitch angle, μs is the friction coefficient of the 
screw thread surface and ρ is the friction angle, the 
related sketch for the acting forces on the bole and nut is 
given in Fig.1.  For a given clamp-up torque, the 
relative bolt axial force can be obtained through Eqn. 1 
and also can be used for the further stress analysis. 
2.2 Hygrothermal Sensitivity Analysis Model 
For a composite structure, the multi-bolted joints 
were usually used.  In order to simplify the model 
analysis process, only a single bolted composite joint 
was considered in Chen’s research [6]. Several 
assumptions were used in this approach [7]: 
1. The bolt axial direction 1-D case is considered. 
2. Stress under washer contact areas is uniform. 
3. Load applied area of laminate equals to load applied 
area of washer. 
4. The stress in each layer may be assumed constant 
through the thickness direction. 
5. Creep effects can be ignored. 
6. Temperature and moisture effects are uncoupled. 
7. Linear theory is applied. 
 
This hygrothermal sensitivity analysis model was 
developed by using the equilibrium equation, the 
stress/strain relations and the compatibility of 
displacements with the relation of the clamp-up torque 
and axial force for V-type screw threads.  The 
hygrothermal expansion effects were also included in 
the model to evaluate the hygrothermal sensitivity. The 
analysis model sketch is shown in Fig. 2, in which tL 
represents the thickness of composite laminate to be 
jointed. A briefing description of this model is given as 
following: 
(a) the equilibrium equation for the bolt stress bσ and 
the laminate stress Lσ is quoted first;

expansion coefficient of IM6/3501-6 composite laminate 
obtained through the reverse approach, the value lies 
between the resin 3501-6 (40×10-6/℃) and the graphite 
fiber T300 (27×10-6/℃), gives a fair result. 
4. Model Analysis Result and Discussion 
There are two portions were discussed for the model 
numerical results:  
Portion one is to evaluate the geometric dimension 
effect on the nut travel distance Nd and the bolt stressσb. 
Portion two is to evaluate the hygrothermal effect on the 
bolt axial force Fb (or bolt stressσb) and the composite 
laminate stressσL. 
4.1 Evaluation of the geometric dimension effect 
For a composite joint component, there are several 
dimensional parameters.  According to Chen and Kung 
[7], two parameters and their values were considered 
namely washer thickness tw=15mm and the wash to bolt 
diameter ratio dw/db=2 to avoid the geometric dimension 
effect on the nut travel distance and the bolt stress. The 
other input data and configurations for the numerical 
analysis are: bolt diameter 6.35mm, bolt length 39.72m, 
double-lap joint, IM6/3501-6 composite laminate with 
[45/90/-45/02/45/02/-45]s stacking sequence and 9.72mm 
total thickness, 4000N-mm, 5000N-mm and 6000N-mm 
clamp-up torques. 
4.2. The hygrothermal effect evaluation 
Fig.7 gives the results of σL with constant geometric 
dimensions (dw/db=2.0, tw=15mm), where temperature 
increments ΔT are from 0℃ to 50℃. From Fig.7, a 
linear relation was obtained between the composite 
laminate stress and the temperature variation; the 
absolute value of σL increased progressively when the 
temperature increment ΔT was raised without moisture 
content (C=0)，this result meets to the original linear 
theory assumption. When ΔT=24℃ ,σL has a double 
increment, it shows that the composite laminate stress 
σL is quite sensitive to temperature hygrothermal factor. 
 In Fig.8, the temperature variation was set to 15℃ 
and 30°C for Fig.9, the composite laminate stress versus 
wash thickness curves with four dw/db ratios were given, 
the curves show that the wash thickness increment 
resulted in a laminate stress increment, a larger 
temperature increment gives more pronounced stress 
increment.  As the dw/db ratio decreased, it resulted to a 
larger laminate stress increasing slope. 
Since the dw/db ratio has a relative large geometric 
effect on the laminate stress, then the evaluation of the 
dw/db ratio effect with two different temperature 
variations ΔT were given in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11.  The 
laminate stress σL tends to alleviate for all cases right 
after the dw/db ratio ＞ 2 and the geometric effect of 
wash thickness is relative very small and can be 
negligible. 
Furthermore the composite laminate with specific 
moisture content under temperature variation effect was 
considered to evaluate the hygrothermal sensitivity on 
the bolt stress and clamp-up torque.  From Fig.12, a 
linear relation was obtained between the clamp-up 
torque and the temperature variation; Tj increased 
progressively when the temperature increment ΔT was 
raised under various moisture content and a similar 
result was also found for the relation between σb and 
ΔT as shown in Fig. 13.  For the composite laminate, 
the change rate of the clamp-up torque with temperature 
is about 107.4N-mm/℃ and for bolt stress is about 1.47 
Mpa/℃.  Both results show that the clamp-up torque 
(bolt force) is quite sensitive to hygrothermal factors. 
5. Conclusions 
 The following conclusions can be drawn from this 
study: 
1. The displacement compatibility consideration of the 
bolt, washer and composite laminates used to obtain
