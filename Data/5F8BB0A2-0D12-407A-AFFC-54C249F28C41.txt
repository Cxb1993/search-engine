Abstract 
This research extends the last two years project 
continuously develop the fuzzy optimization process 
and technique using the response surface methodology 
(RSM).  The primary research topic is to develop the 
solution method for dealing with fuzzy variables, fuzzy 
parameters and discrete variables simultaneously exists 
in the objective or/and constrained functions.  
Particularly, for attacking a large-scale problem it is 
necessary to apply RSM and transform the original 
fuzzy functions to the ordinary allowable fuzzy number 
problem.  The most challenging task in such a work is 
to pay effort to dealing with a mix of discrete type 
variables.  Furthermore, the arising problem is how to 
solve it to meet the required feasibility and robustness in 
obtaining the optimum result.  Consequently, a 
proposed complete multidisciplinary design process and 
technique is presented in this paper.  Moreover, since 
the problem itself and the solution method are relative 
difficult, as compare a general allowable fuzzy number 
problem, an example with middle-level complex 
problem is adopted here for demonstrating the presented 
integrated design methodology. 
Keywords: Fuzzy optimization, response surface 
method, computational structural mechanics, CAD, 
mixed and fuzzy variables optimization. 
 
二、緣由與目的 
應用有限元素分析(finite element analysis, FEA)
於結構最佳化設計時，結構規格愈大表示設計變數，
限制函數及目標函數愈多及愈非線性化，也就構成愈
複雜的題目，所需的計算時間相對愈長。當限制條件
函數含有允許模糊值(allowable fuzzy number)時，其
處理方式與過程則更加耗費計算時間，其複雜度及困
難度又隨著需用 FEA 而增加。應用近似
(approximation) 法的觀念及技術，將結構的回應值轉
換成設計變數的顯(explicit)函數，再研究發展最佳解
搜尋策略與程序，於搜尋變動設計解時，就無須屢次
進行 FEA，達到增進求解的效率。 
處理含允許模糊值的最佳化設計問題，一般的解
法為 Wang 等[1]的階切法(level-cut method)，又稱為
α 切法(α -cut method)。其困難在於設計者不易選擇
適當的α 值。Rao[2]認為目標函數和限制條件兩者皆
存在著模糊資訊，並採用適當的目標函數歸屬函數，
以最大化最小的α 值觀念求解。Shih [3]提出單切策
略(single-cut strategy)，針對允許模糊值問題求取唯一
解。對於模糊區間的處理，常以三角模糊數作為基礎
並建立歸屬函數。有關以近似法觀念處理結構最佳化
的研究方面，Rule [4]提出全域回應表面的近似法
(response surface methodology, RSM)處理結構最佳
化，宣稱可得到較好的結果。Roux [5]探討應用 RSM
求解結構最佳化的問題時，發展逐次縮小設計空間及
實驗設計(design of experiment, DOE)的技術。史等人
[6]建議用線性佈點法降低 FEA 計算次數，及用連續
縮減空間法有效的提昇結構最佳設計解題效率，也是
史等人的首次 RSM 於結構最佳設計之研究。接著李
[7]發表處理含允許模糊值的問題，採用與文獻[6]相
同之佈點策略，設計程序的敘述並不十分清楚。王[8]
發表單切的研究，由於採用了隨機佈點法再加上整體
解題程序不盡相同，十桿設計結果不如李所得的結果
[7]。史與陳等[9]發表具適應性之可調整回應表面近
似法結合在結構最佳化，相較於文獻[6]，由於減少
重覆佈點數因而可減少 FEA，但仍嫌太多。另外
Venterm 與 Haftka [10] 的研究，使用 RSM 處理與本
論文不同之模糊參數問題，應用在小範圍且設計變數
較少的飛機零件設計問題上，有效減少分析的次數。 
   在處理模糊參數(fuzzy parameter)及變數(fuzzy 
variable)等問題的文獻極少，Arakawa 及 Yamakawa
的論文[11](以日文撰寫)為初始的觀念，在 1999 年的
會議論文[12]提出最佳化設計的方法，涵蓋穩健設計
(robust design)意味。又，在一般實際的工程問題，尚
包含整數與離散型式的混合變數。Huang[13]利用分
支與界限法(branch and bound method)、模擬退火法
(simulated annealing)及遺傳演算法(genetic algorithm)
來求解離散最佳化問題。賴[14]將模糊最佳化應用到
非線性混合實數、整數及離散變數，成為離散模糊最
佳化設計，並使用分支與界限法來求解設計例題。王
正堯[15]利用回應表面法處理離散模糊最佳化問
題，將 RSM 結合分支與界限法觀念處理離散最佳化
設計問題。 
    本文用回應表面近似法，建構替代目標函數或限
制條件函數，同時函數中具有模糊參數及模糊變數，
但都是隱函數的最佳化問題，本文正是發展其數學模
型並探討解題策略及流程。針對具有模糊參數及變數
的最佳化問題，參考 Arakawa[11]的研究，將具有模
糊性質的最佳化設計題型轉為明確問題，發展階切策
略求取唯一解。再考慮設計變數為混合變數，即包含
了連續變數、模糊連續變數及離散變數，以發展含混
和變數，模糊參數與模糊變數的回應表面近似函數最
佳化設計的解法與程序技術。

2. Topology Optimization by Minimizing 
Compliance 
The aim is to find the material distribution with the 
minimization of the compliance (the maximization of 
stiffness or strength) of a body using a fixed amount of 
material.  The problem is to ask what is the strongest 
layout and shape of this body.  A general topological 
design layout is shown in Figure 1 below.  The body is 
subjected to forces at the top end and supported at the 
bottom left end.  The shape of the body is allowed to vary, 
under the condition that its boundary is within the design 
domain Ω .  The optimal layout is found by discretizing 
the design domain using the finite element method (FEM) 
to find the stresses and displacements.  The optimization 
criterion used in this work is based on the approximation 
technique called the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) 
continuously and sequentially approaches to the optimal 
material distribution. 
 
 
 
Figure 1 The model of a general topology optimization 
problem. 
 
The design variable ex  represents the relative density 
of the material in a finite element e expressed in oex ρρ = .  
The density oρ  is the original material density of a single 
element.  Once a certain element is solid which means 
ex =1.  In the model of SIMP, the Young’s modulus of 
each element is represented as oee ExE
α)(=  where α  is 
a penalty factor and oE  is original material Young’s 
modulus.  In order to obtain true “0-1” design, 3≥α  is 
usually required.  In this paper, α =3 is selected for all 
study unless specified.  The stiffness of the body is 
measured by its compliance which indicates the work 
done by the external forces on the body.  By arranging the 
displacements iu  and the forces iF  on every node in the 
design domain in vectors, u and F respectively, we can 
express the compliance as uFC T=  by the definition of 
work as force times displacement.  (Note: The material is 
assumed to be linear so that the energy stored within the 
body is ½FTu.)  Using FEM yields a linear equation 
system relating the stresses in the body to the 
displacements, F=Ku , where F denotes the applied forces, 
K the stiffness matrix and u the displacement vector.  
Since K is symmetric, i.e. KT=K, the compliance may be 
written as KuuuFC TT == . 
 
2.1 Mathematical formulation 
A general topology optimization problem by 
minimizing the compliance with a material volume 
constraint can be written in the following discrete form: 
Find TNxxx ],...,,[ 21=X , where each ix  represents the 
relative density of the material in the ith finite element 
iex )( .  The mathematical formulation is written as: 
uF T

In the solution, FuK =)( eE  must be satisfied.  The lower 
and upper bound of each design variable normally is 
chosen as 0.001xmin =  and 1.0xmax = , respectively.  In 
the topology optimization problem, the allowable volume 
fraction aV  normally is below 0.5; 0.3 is preferred by 
most users.  The present model of optimization problem 
contains a large number of design variables with few 
constraints, thus the efficiency of an optimization solution 
procedure is crucial. 
 
2.2 MMA based optimization 
Two optimization approaches for above mathematical 
model had been extensively studied by Sigmund and 
Pedersen [7].  The first method is based on the Lagrangian 
function and use the optimality criteria for updating the 
design variables and the Lagrangian multiplier found in 
the iteration.  The second method is based on the method 
of moving asymptotes (MMA) [8, 9] based on a nonlinear 
approximation approach.  The algorithm of MMA has 
been proven to be versatile and well suited for such large 
scale topology optimization problems [1].  In topology 
design typically a moderate number of constraints existed 
in the problem, the most effective method for calculating 
derivatives with respect to design variables is the adjoint 
method, as termed the sensitivity analysis.  A general 
computing algorithm of structural topology optimization 
by minimizing compliance design using MMA based 
optimization is described as following: 
1. Define the problem with domain and boundary 
condition. 
2. Formulate the topology optimization with minimizing

This paper applies the filter technique of Sigmund’s 
[10] to eliminate checkerboard phenomenon with single 
node connection.  The adjoint method for first and second 
derivative calculation is used for providing the sensitivity 
information in MMA based optimization computation. 
 
4. Topology Optimization by Minimizing both 
Compliance and Weight subjected to Stress 
Constraints 
The relation between the maximum von Mises stress 
and volume fraction in Figure 5 reveals that the optimum 
maximum induced stress is the function of volume 
fraction in the minimum compliance’s topology design.  
This phenomenon can be utilized to establish an explicit 
function so that an analytical stress constraint is able to 
immediately handle in topology optimization.  Through 
numerical regression one can obtain an approximate 
function such that: 
 
264.98674.325447.469704.229)( 23 +−+−= VVVVeσ      (6) 
 
Figure 5 shows the plot of max )(Veσ  indicated by small 
circles in terms of material volume fraction.  Another 
dotted curve represents the relation min )(Veσ  of volume 
fraction.  A design constraint considering the restriction of 
maximum von Mises stress can be conveniently handled 
by applying this explicit expression. 
 
 
 
Figure 5 Approximate function of max )(Veσ  and 
min )(Veσ . 
 
Thus, a practical topology optimization of minimizing 
compliance includes the consideration of allowable von 
Mises stress can be done and described.  In the topology 
optimization of minimizing compliance, the final result 
ultimately will approach to the upper bound of volume 
fraction; therefore, it simultaneously require to minimize 
weight (volume fraction) as another design objective.  So 
that the vector of design variables is rewritten 
as TN Vxxx ],,...,,[ 21=X , in the current problem the total 
number of variables N is 676 including V.  The objective 
is written as:

The side constraint of the ith x design variable and V are  
1001.0 ≤≤ ix  and 8.02.0 ≤≤V , respectively.  The 
sensitivity of the objective function can be obtained by 
adjoint method, i.e. the analytical constraint of Eq. (9) of 
von Mises stress can be used directly for derivatives 
calculation.  Four optimum topology results are 
demonstrated in Figure 6 with different alleV , .  Similarly, 
one can apply the constraints concerning displacement in 
terms of volume fraction in the topology optimization 
process.  Actually, any property related to volume fraction 
can be established and add on the design constraints.

One may be curious to know that how about the 
topology layout obtained from Eq. (1) to (3) using the 
allowable value of aV  yielded from the result of Figure 6.  
Figure 7 shows the final topology layout of fulfilling such 
a point of view.  The numerical values of maximum von 
Mises stresses in Figure 6 corresponding to that in Figure 
7 are very close each other that sufficiently show the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach.  One can observes 
the topological differences between including stress 
constraint (shown in Figure 6) and without stress 
constraint (shown in Figure 7).  Other physical properties 
can apply the similar approach to put constraints on the 
optimization formulation so that a compromise and 
balance topology layout can be obtained.

1. Abstract  
A recent integration of the amplifying device produces very fine resolution so as to meet the accelerated development of 
nanotechnology and high-tech precision manufacturing.  This paper refers to a single-axis nano-positioning stage including an 
amplifying lever actuated by a PZT to redesign a monolithic compliant amplifier by the topological optimal synthesis.  The method of 
moving asymptotes (MMA) has been applied to the optimization of compliant amplifier and mounts it on the flexural nano stage in a 
single bed foundation.  Thus, this one-piece compound compliant mechanism consists of the amplifier and nano-motion bed.  The finite 
element analyzed result for both in this paper and in referring single-axis nano-positioning stage shows a good conformity, the 
proposed topological base design yields to a larger magnification factor.  This study shows that the topology synthesis provide a more 
creative, flexible and efficient way for designing the mechanical amplifying mechanism integrated in PZT nano-positioning stage.

3. Introduction 
High precision and high positioning performances are extremely important along with the rapid growing of semiconductor, MEMS 
(Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) and highly precision manufacturing process [1].  The popular used dual motion positioning stage, 
motor actuated ball screw or linear slider for coarse motion and associated piezoelectric parts for fine motion, requires a difficult 
control system due to compose different structure and materials.  A recent idea of integrating the amplifying device [2] directly expand 
the motion of nano stage is very convenient for the control method and behavior.  This assembly device makes the very fine resolution 
possible that meets the accelerated development of nanotechnology and high-tech precision manufacturing. 
The earlier effort of Yang [3] applied the flexure structural mechanics that developed an amplifying device incorporated with 
piezoelectric actuated single-axis nano stage.  Lee [4] also applied flexural mechanics proposed a design of micro XY-stage.  Ryu [2] 
presented a flexure hinge based XYθ wafer stage with size optimization constrained the travel distance within 100 µm.  Elmustafa and 
Lagally [5] applied the finite element analysis to study the behavior of the nano-position stage guided by the flexural-hinges for 
precision machining.  Another micro-stage analysis presented by Dai et al. [6] where the finite element analysis also used to study the 
behavior of the flexural hinge guided nano-motion.  Such the monolithic structure contains flexures that gain its mobility from the 
flexibility of some or all of members, so called the compliant mechanism.  Many compliant mechanisms in the past were designed by 
trial and error approaches.  A recent book [7] introduces the pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) to systematically analyze general 
compliant structures.  A historical development of compliant mechanisms has been presented by Chang and Wang [8], and investigated 
with a four-bar compliant micro-mechanism in polyethylene (PU) material.  Fu [9] applied PRBM including mechanical flexures and 
amplifying lever with size optimization for a nanometer positioning stage.  Hsiao [10] adopted Fu’s nano-resolution stage to perform 
the finite element analysis and a tolerance design. 
Topology optimization is a recently well developed numerical technique for the synthesis of monolithic compliant mechanisms.  
Sigmund [11] first introduced the micro displacement inverter and amplifier that can be structurally created by the topological 
optimization.  Huang and Lan [12] presented a micro mechanical amplifier that couples with a PZT actuator.  Shih et al. [13] proposed 
a system design process at first by topology optimization and then by a multiple objective optimization technique for a compliant micro 
gripper.  They pointed out that the hinge-like locations created from the topology optimization have been verified to be the exact 
locations of the flexure hinges in a monolithic compliant mechanism. 
This paper refers to Fu’s [9] demonstration of a single-axis nano-positioning stage including an amplifying lever actuated by a PZT.  
The design goal, conditions and requirements are the same with Fu’s work.  Applying the knowledge, experience and technique gained 
in [13] the monolithic compliant amplifier is redesign primarily by the topological synthesis, and mount it on the flexural nano stage in 
a one bed foundation.  This one-piece compound compliant mechanism consists of the amplifier and nano-motion bed further been 
analyzed by the finite element analysis.  The performance, strategy, and parameters are presented and discussed in the proposed paper 
as an alternative design for the mechanical amplifying mechanism integrated in PZT nano-positioning stage. 
 
4. Model of Nano-resolution Stage 
The design model of a completed nano-positioning stage [9] is shown in Figure 1 that composes a PZT actuator, an amplifying lever 
and a flexure motion stage.  Such the one-piece nano-motion stage with four double compound leaf springs and two notch hinges 
(indicated in B) are machined by using wire EDM (electric discharge machining).  A PZT actuator has been applied at the location A.  
The whole stage is made of material SUS304 which has the density 7.92 g/cm3, Young’s modulus 190 GPa, Poisson ratio 0.29 and 
yielding strength 520 MPa.  The design goals require high stiffness, more than 200 Hz natural frequency, and a maximum output stroke.  
Fu [9] applied a genetic algorithm for the size optimization resulted in a maximum output stroke 135.8 nm (nanometer) and a natural 
frequency 280.8 Hz.  Additionally, the experimental work used a P-840.30 PZT shows a maximum output stroke of 109.8 nm and 
 
 
such that the output displacement is maximized, can be formulated as: 
 
Maximize outyUf =)(X (X)                                                                            (1)

In the optimization process, the relation of { } { }UKF ][=  must be satisfied.  The relative density in each element is a design 
variable.  Eq. (2) indicates the control volume must be restricted within a specified value Va.  From the Fu’s work [9], the control 
volume is estimated around 64.2%.  Therefore, in this study a 60% is used as required control volume.  Since the useful output 
motion is only vertical direction; thus, Eq. (3) indicates the output displacement in horizontal direction is constrained less than 
vertical direction.  In this paper, the design domain (46 mm×18 mm×18.5 mm) of a compliant magnifying mechanism is shown 
in Figure 3 which is identical to the outer edge in Fu’s work.  The slant line at the right edge denotes the supported area. 
 
 
 
                                        Figure 3 Design domain of amplifying mechanism using topology optimization 
 
The output coefficient of soft spring is 61036.0 × N/m; and the coefficient in input spring is 20 times of output spring.  The material is 
SUS304.  An input force 1 Newton is applied at a distance of 9.5 mm from the center of the support area, as shown in Figure 3.  The 
method used in the topology optimization is the solid isotropic microstructure with penalization (SIMP).  The method of moving 
asymptotes (MMA) is adopted as the optimizer for optimum search [17, 18] coupled with the adjoint method for sensitivity analysis 
that can reduce the computation of finite element analysis.  In the solution process, the technique of a mesh-dependent filter is utilized 
to avoid and reduce checkerboard-like phenomenon.  The total finite element number used is 104×36.  The optimized topology 
synthesis can be obtained as shown in Figure 4.  Some interesting numerical values obtained after the topology optimization are 
described as follows.  The maximum vertical output displacement is 300.52 nm; the maximum horizontal output displacement is 7.72 
nm; the vertical input displacement is 61.0 nm, so that the magnification factor of vertical displacement is 4.927.

5.2 Post Design Phase and Integration 
The topology obtained in Figure 4 has a well shape; however, the edges are not smooth and clear enough for a practical use.  Based on 
our experiences with some intuition, a modification can be treated after Figure 4 created.  By the investigation of Shih et al. [13], at the 
bottom right and above the support area there is a hinge-like flexure can be observed even it looks like a single point connection.  The 
center of such a hinge at the support is then fixed so that the final modification of the amplifier with hinge area is presented in Figure 5.  
The distance of the applying load from the hinge is 8.25 mm that is measured from the outcome of topology optimization.  The primary 
dimension of nano-motion bed is presented in Figure 6.  The portion of this stage bed maintains the same as that in Fu’s work.  
Consequently, a complete bed of nano stage connecting a compliant amplifying mechanism is shown in Figure 7 where an additional 
flexure hinge at the output portion is presented in Figure 8.  So far this assembly of nano device is ready for the analysis using ANSYS.

6. Performances Analysis of nano Stage with Amplifier 
ANSYS is used for the post analysis for this assembly nano stage design.  The free mesh can be generated as shown in Figure 9.  Figure 
10 indicates the displacement distribution of this nano stage assembly.  SMX indicates the maximum vertical displacement occurring at 
the front head of the amplifying mechanism.  However, the useful point is right on the connection between the bed of nano stage and 
amplifying lever, as shown in Figure 11.  In there, one can see a point with the output vertical displacement is 192.58 nm.

When one compares the current design based on the topological synthesis and the existing design presented in Fu [9] and Hsiao [10], 
Table 1 summarizes some properties and performance.  The expression outyU ,  indicates the vertical output displacement; inyU ,  
indicates the vertical input displacement; and outxU ,  indicates the horizontal output displacement.  M.F. means the magnification factor 
indicates a ratio of outyU ,  to inyU , .  The expression eσ  indicates the resulting maximum von Mises stress.  Both analyzed results of 
this paper and [10] show a good conformity.  Additionally, the proposed topological basis design yield to a larger magnification factor 
(M.F.) than Hsiao.  A larger vertical output displacement can be obtained by slightly move the applied load toward left direction.  For 
example, when the applied load 1Newton relocates at 11-mm away from the support hinge, the vertical output displacement becomes 
257.66 nm.  Under this study, topology synthesis provide a more convenient and efficient way, particularly, several topological 
outcomes can be generated through different control volume, boundary condition and material properties depending on the designer’s 
preference.  Thus, the topology optimization is surely an alternative synthesis methodology with much creativity and flexibility for a 
monolithic compliant mechanism.

7. Concluding Remarks 
This paper shows the ability of the MMA that is good at topological structural optimization.  Through the presented design and analysis, 
one can be certain that the topological synthesis is a very creative and effective method to generate an alternatively initial layout for a 
monolithic compliant mechanism, particularly in the case of mechanical amplifier design.  The resultant topological structure can yield 
to a maximum magnification factor and a satisfying output displacement.  This paper successfully demonstrated a redesign monolithic 
compliant amplifier applying the topological optimal synthesis and the numerical analysis of a single-axis nano-positioning stage with 
an amplifying lever actuated by a PZT.  A further study can be extend to three dimension, simultaneous minimize compliance and 
weight, and includes stress constraints in one phase.
