1 Introduction
Nonlinear effects arise in the high-density magnetic recording, which causes
a performance degradation of the corresponding detector [1]-[3]. In design-
ing a detector, timing recovery loop is an essential component which allows
the readback signal can be correctly sampled and processed for retrieving
the storage data [4]. A phase detector is required to estimate the tim-
ing error and several sampling phase detectors have been proposed [5]-[7].
Among these, the Muller & Mueller’s phase detector is often adopted for
its simple realization. However, fewer researchers have studied on the ef-
fects of the timing function for a high-density magnetic recording channel
in the presence of the nonlinear distortions. Fortunately, several models
has been proposed to characterize these nonlinear effects, known as the
transition shift and partial erasure [8]-[13]. Based on the channel model,
we concentrate on the derivation of the corresponding timing function for
the Muller & Mueller’s phase detector in the presence of the transition shift
and partial erasure. The statistical properties of the storage data become
nontrivial due to the non-linearities, which complicates the derivation of
the timing function or namely the S-curve.
In this study, we first obtain the statistics for the storage data in
the presence of the non-linearities and apply these results to derive the
timing function of the Muller & Mueller’s phase detector for a partially
equalized class IV (PR4) channel. The S-curve is found to be a suitable
timing function in the presence of the partial erasure, but the slope of the
timing function at the origin is decreased as compared with that of a linear
channel model. In addition, the timing function is a linear combination of
two functions; one of these two functions is identical to that of a magnetic
recording channel in the absence of the nonlinear distortions, and the other
is itself a suitable candidate for a timing function. The timing function for
the transition shift is also presented and it causes a non-uniform shift of
the S-curve with a different timing error. Computer simulations are given
to verify these results.
2 Partial erasure Plus Transition Shift Model
In terms of the partial erasure plus transition shift model, the playback
signal of a high-density recording channel can be expressed as
y(t) =
∑
k
rkbks(t− kT − bkbk−14 ²T ) (1)

3 Muller & Mueller’s phase detector for a nonlinear magnetic
channel
Sampling the readback signal in a proper time is essential and important
for the design of the detector. In this section, we will examine the method
to extract the timing information, namely, the phase detector, and focus on
the Muller & Mueller’s phase detector that is widely used in a magnetic
recording channel. The readback signal is used for deriving the timing
information of the Muller & Mueller’s phase detector; the timing error τm
is given by
τm = ymdˆm−1 − ym−1dˆm (8)
where the tentative decision dˆm can be either a hard decision or a soft
decision.
The timing function or S-curve is defined as the mean of the timing
error τm, and is denoted by τ = E[τm] where E[·] denotes the expectation
operation. The magnetic recording channel is often partially equalized as
recording density increases. Assume the channel is PR4-equalized, i.e.,
s(t) = h(t) + h(t + T ) (9)
where h(t) is the raised-cosined function. In addition, the tentative deci-
sion can be obtained by a slicer and is given by
dˆm =

2, ym > 1
−2, ym < −1
0, else
(10)
The tentative decision dˆm is assumed correct to derive the timing function
for simplicity, i.e.,
dˆm = dm
= am − am−2 (11)
The S-curve of the Muller & Mueller’s phase detector is thus given by
E[τm] = E[ymdˆm−1 − ym−1dˆm]
= E[ym(am−1 − am−3)− ym−1(am − am−2)]
= E[Am −Bm] (12)
where the two additional terms Am and Bm are defined to reduce the
lengthy expressions in equation (12). The parameters Am and Bm are
respectively given by
Am = ym(am−1 − am−3) (13)

Table 1: Parameter settings for analyses of timing function
γ and ² will be in the set {1, γ1, γ2} and {0,-1}, respectively. The corre-
sponding timing functions are analyzed and discussed in the followings.
Before we derived the timing functions, the statistics of the storage data
am and rm is first analyzed. The transition-width ratio rm is determined
by bm−1 and bm+1 or equivalently am−2, am−1, am and am+1, and the de-
pendence between rm and am complicates the evaluation of the timing
of equation (12). However, we have obtained the correlation functions
between rm and am, and they are given by
E[rm−lam−iam−j] = σ(γ1) , if i = j ∀ l
E[rm−lam−iam−j] = ρ(γ1) , if l = i and i = j + 1
E[rm−lam−iam−j] = ρ(γ1) , if l = i− 2 and i = j + 1
E[rm−lam−iam−j] = 0 , else
(18)
where σ(γ1) and ρ(γ1) are two functions determined by the reduction
parameter γ1, and the values are tabulated in table 2. Note that the
common setting γ2 = γ21 is assumed. These correlation functions are used
to derive the timing function in the next subsection.

4.1 Linear Channel Model
The conventionally linear model is first considered by simply setting the
parameters rm−k = 1 and pm−k = 0, and the statistics (15) is used in the
case. Then, the equations (16) and (17) are obtained as
E[Am] = s(T − τ)− s(−τ)− s(3T − τ) + s(2T − τ) (19)
and
E[Bm] = s(−T − τ)− s(−2T − τ)− s(T − τ) + s(−τ) (20)
8
4.3 Channel Model with Transition Shift
When the transition shift is considered, the parameter pm−k can either 1
or 0 and rm−k = 1. The resulting timing function is given by
E[τm] = E[s(T − pm−1²T − τ)− s(−pm²T − τ)− s(3T − pm−3²T − τ)
+ s(2T − pm−2²T − τ)− s(−T − pm²T − τ) + s(−2T − pm+1²T − τ)
+ s(T − pm−2²T − τ)− s(−pm−1²T − τ)] (27)
In the presence of transition shift, the S-curve will be obtained through
the computer simulations.
5 Computer Simulations
In this section, computer simulations are used to show the the effects of the
timing function under nonlinear distortions. Assume the channel response
has been equalized into the PR4 channel. The noisy readback signal is
given by
zm = ym + nm (28)
where nm is the additive white Gaussian noise, and the signal to noise
ratio (SNR) is defined as E[y2m]/E[n
2
m]. The timing error τm is obtained
by equation (8) with correct tentative decisions; the ideal timing function
is evaluated by equation (21). The timing functions for various ²’s under
γ2 = γ1 = 1 are depicted in Fig. 1. We find that a transition shift ²
leads to a non-uniform shift with different τ . Furthermore, the transition
shift is ignored, the timing functions for different partial erasure γ1’s are
simulated and shown in Fig. 2 where the common setting γ2 = γ21 is used.
The simulation shows that the partial erasure effect causes a decreasing
slope of the S-curve.
6 Conclusion
The statistical properties of the storage data are first examined, and the
effects on the timing function of the Muller & Mueller’s phase detector are
analyzed for the PR4-equalized magnetic channel in the presence of the
nonlinear distortions. Computer simulations are also used to verify the
timing function. It is found that a transition shift causes a non-uniform
shift of the S-curve with a different timing error, and the partial erasure
effect decreases the slope of the S-curve. The result can be extended to
the high-order partial responses, and a more compact expression for the
timing function is expected to be obtained.
