Bio-based butanol has superior properties when compared to ethanol to be the
gasohol and is gradually considered to be an important biofuel from the biomass
fermentation. The potential sorbents for this 1-butanol, acetone, as well as ethanol
recovery process will be obtained from the analysis of the isotherm data. The
purpose of this research is to select sorbents used to adsorb 1-butanol, acetone,
ethanol and water vapor for gas-phase single-component adsorption equilibrium
study by gravimetric adsorption equilibrium apparatus. The isotherm data were
obtained in this study as well as the development of regression models for the
isotherm data. The potential sorbents of immobilized starch and ZSM-5 for this 1-
butanol recovery process was determined from the analysis of the isotherm data and
the selected sorbents were conducted to the liquid phase multi-components
competitive adsorption study also.
Introduction
The acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE)
fermentation process used to be the main
process for industrial production of
acetone and butanol until the mid-20th
century. However, the highest butanol
concentration obtained in Clostridial
fermentations was around 20 g L−1.1,2
This limitation occurs due to butanol
toxicity. The mechanism of butanol
toxicity is related to the hydrophobic
nature of this compound, the primary
effect of butanol appears to be on
disruption of the phospholipid component
of the cell membrane.3
Bio-based butanol has superior
properties when compared to ethanol to be
the gasohol and is gradually considered to
be an important biofuel from the biomass
fermentation. These properties include
higher calorific value, low vapor pressure,
low freezing point and miscibility with
gasoline and diesel. In this context, in
2007, DuPont (US) and BP (UK)
announced their plans to produce bio-
butanol to be used as a new gasoline
extender.
A limited number of studies on the
adsorption of butanol have been carried
out using potato immobilized starch as an
adsorbent.4 However, not only do these
immobilized potato starch adsorb butanol,
but they also adsorb the by-products such as
acetone and ethanol. Earlier studies obtained
only equilibrium adsorption data of ethanol,
however, the rate of butanol adsorption from
aqueous solution onto immobilized potato
starch has not been described in the
literature. In the current study, immobilized
potato starch was demonstrated to adsorb
acetone and ethanol selectively from water
and showed high affinity for two of them,
while it hardly adsorbed the butanol.
Furthermore, the present paper gives new
information about the potential of
inexpensive adsorbent which could be
available for practical applications. The aim
of this study was to obtain the adsorption
isotherms and adsorption rate of butanol on
immobilized potato starch.
The selected sorbents used to adsorb 1-
butanol, acetone, ethanol and water vapor
for gas-phase single-component adsorption
equilibrium study by gravimetric adsorption
equilibrium apparatus. The isotherm data
were obtained in this study as well as the
development of regression models for the
isotherm data. The potential sorbents for this

Following the report of adsorption and
successful recovery of butanol using ZSM-5
was the first to be conducted in this process
in the ABE solution. The concentration of
butanol before adsorption in the ABE
solution was in 9.02 g/L of the butanol (in
liquid phase adsorption experiment) in the
ABE solution was obtained with adsorption
capacities (uptake) ranging from 35 mg/g to
45 mg/g (in gas phase adsorption
experiment).

The adsorption on immobilized starch
from single component of acetone can be
describe with the help of the Langmuir
equation. For butanol adsorption the
maximum uptake value was investigated at
22.32136 mg/g, for ethanol 4.41091 mg/g,
and for acetone 11.22978 mg/g.
Adsorption capacity (or loading) is the most
important characteristic of an adsorbent.

Liquid adsorption.
Liquid phase experiments, the
concentration of the unknown solution into
the gas chromatograph, get the value of
the integral area for example we can see in
figure 4-14, then use calibration curve to
find out the solution of concentration. The
calibration curve has been available to
calculated after the sorbent remove water.

gas chromatograph analysis
Using the calibration curve to find the
concentration initial and final
concentrations from the calculated area of
the GC peak, is converted into weight
fraction, the weight fraction is translated
into the volume fractions, be the volume
of ethanol and water (2ml of solution

- Liquid phase adsorption by ZSM-5
From this equation we get the highest
uptake is from Butanol is 121.28 mg/g, then
acetone 12.84 mg/g and the last is ethanol
uptake is 0.11 mg/g.
- Liquid phase adsorption by immobilized

From this equation we get the highest
uptake is from Butanol is 114.95 mg/g, then
acetone 19.05 mg/g and the last is ethanol
uptake is 1.024 mg/g.
Selectivity of Butanol. Because of the
hydrophilic property of immobilized starch,
it adsorbs ethanol well. However, in terms
of butanol selectivity, potato starch is
superior over ZSM-5. In order for the starch
to be used repeatedly, it needs to be
immobilized to a support like ZSM-5.

二、與會心得
實驗室過去在綠色能源技術及其應用之研究成果表現優異。本次會議為國際上重要之
能源與環境永續發展研討會，會中有來自全球學者發表最新之能源與環境永續相關學理、技
術及應用，可瞭解國際相關領域發展趨勢，也可將目前開發生質能源應用技術，提供與會學
者一起討論，可藉由此機會與各地專家學者共同討論，對目前研究工作相當有助益。本次會
議除口頭發表論文外，其中大陸石油公司技術部門主管，特地到會場來致意，並了解台灣中
油公司在印尼痲瘋樹生質燃料計畫進度，該公司也有意往國外取得生質燃油之原料，而我實
驗室協過去助過許多大型上市公司往印尼發展的經驗也提出供其參考。本次報告主要重點分
述如下：
1. Physical Properties of Crude Jatropha Oil and its Blends - The changes of viscosity of CJO
and its blends were shown in Table 1. These blends were stirred well so that the mixtures were in a
stable condition for a longer time. As shown in Table 1, the diesel fuel has the lowest kinematic
viscosity, flash point and mid boiling point as well as highest CFPP, calorific value, gravity and
cetane index compared to those of CJO and its blends. The CJO has the highest kinematic viscosity
and flash point as well as lowest calorific value and gravity. The high viscosity of plant oils affects
the atomization and spray pattern of fuel, leading to incomplete combustion and severe carbon
deposits, injector choking and piston ring sticking. Studies have showed that the usage of pure
plant oils is not preferable. Based on the above results, the present findings suggested that it is
unfeasible to use straight plant oil. Thus, some modifications should be done to reduce the
viscosity and the method used in this study is blending with diesel fuel. Our results suggested that
the kinematic viscosity increased gradually with the rising ratio of CJO compared to that of diesel
fuel, especially at up to 50 vol%. The increase in the kinematic viscosity was due to the higher
percentages of CJO in the blends. Similarly, flash point and mid boiling point also increased with
the increasing percentages of CJO in the blends up to 50 vol% compared to that of diesel fuel. The
generator using crude Jatropha oil blends were shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, CO, CO2 and
NOX emissions from crude Jatropha oil blends are lower, but O2 emissions are higher compared to
those of diesel fuels.
實驗室過去在麻瘋樹生質能源技術及其應用之研究成果表現優異，本次會議可瞭解國
際相關領域發展趨勢，也可將麻瘋樹植物油混入化石柴油作為一般柴油發電之燃料應用技
術，同時對混合油的油品進行探討，對於目前進行之研究案執行相當有助益，而大陸將麻瘋
樹計畫列為重點發展也令人印象深刻。

本次大會場地為上海電力學院，適逢該校 60周年校慶，有系列相關活動，因此也參觀校園及
各項文化展覽活動。
五、建議
最近幾年我參加國際會議心得大都相似如下:
1. 近年來國際會議之舉辦在中國相當頻繁，累積有相當好的經驗。我們可以吸取相關經驗用
於國內舉辦國際研討會之應用。
2. 部分 Section Chair 的英文不論是聽或講都不佳，造成很多困擾擾，主要可能是為了讓其它
地區來的學者參與。但亞洲非英語系國家的學者，事實上有學術及語言相當優異之學者可榮
膺，不應流於酬庸，大陸地區這類事情發生機率更頻繁，讓會議造成遺憾。這也讓我們想到
國內國科會對研究成果績效，要求擔任 Invited Speaker、Section Chair 等國際會議職務為重要
績效，部分學者硬著頭皮去搶，主辦單位迫於無奈同意，接下來上演的，就不在話下了。如
何避免？政府應有相關政策因應，否則可預期會有會越來越多這樣的台灣學者出現在國際會

performance in diesel engines [5,6]. Studies have been made, and these tested results have proved 
that Jatropha oils are feasible substitutes for diesel fuel. However, there is still a lot of work that 
has to be done to make Jatropha oil really applicable to different types diesel engines. Thus, the 
aim of this study is to achieve a better understanding of the important physico-chemical properties 
of Jatropha oil and its blends with diesel fuel, as well as the emissions characteristics in diesel 
generator fueled with Jatropha oil blends running at a maximum load of 1000 W for 1 h. The 
present results suggested that Jatropha oil blends may be considered an alternative fuel in diesel 
engine for generating electric energy during the operating conditions. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Materials. Mature Jatropha seed was purchased from India. Jatropha oil was obtained by 
mechanical pressing. The seeds were roasted about the temperatures ranging from 70 to 80°C. After 
pressing, the impurities and gum particles of the oil were removed using filtrating and the oil was 
stored at room temperature for further use. Fossil diesel was obtained from China Petroleum 
Corporation (CPC), Taiwan. Other reagents used were of reagent grade or higher. 
Fuel Properties. From the literature it is evident that blending of vegetable oil with diesel fuel 
would bring the viscosity close to a speciﬁc range. Therefore, crude Jatropha oil was blended with 
diesel oil in varying proportions with the intention of reducing its viscosity close to that of the 
diesel fuel. The various blends were stable under normal conditions. A kinematic viscosity meter 
(Model KV4000, Koehler, U.S.) was used to measure the viscosity of all samples. The sample heat 
value was determined using calorimeter at 25 
o
C (C200, IKA, Germany). Cold filter plugging point 
(CFPP) were performed using an Automatic cold filter plugging point analyzer (HCP842, Walter 
Herzog, Germany). Flash point was determined using a flash point tester (HFP380, Walter Herzog, 
Germany). Boiling point was carried out using front view distillation apparatus (K45200, Koehler, 
U.S.). Gravity was measured using a portable density/specific gravity meter (DA-130N, KEM, 
Japan). The cetane index is a measure of the ignition quality of a fuel and influences white smoke 
and combustion roughness. This parameter was calculated according to the ASTM D976-91 
standard test method based on mid boiling point and gravity of fuels. The physical and chemical 
properties of crude Jatropha oil and its blends are measured and tabulated in Table 1.

Emission Test. The studies were carried out in an air cooled diesel generator (Model: 
YDG2700E-6CS, Yanmar Company, Japan). Two Halogen lights (total 1000 W) were used as the 
engine load during the tests. Before the experiment, we tried a very short term test for 30 min using 
different crude Jatropha oil blends and diesel fuels. This experiment used two halogen lights as an 
engine load. The combustion efficiency was calculated by the Lertsathapornsuka method [7]. Our 
results suggested that the similar consumption efficiencies are observed on these tested fuels under 
1000 W load. Thus, the next tests in the diesel generator were carried out for 60 min in order to 
maintain stable power output up to 60 min to meet the requirement of emergency power supply 
systems in Taiwan. In addition, the gas emission of different CJO blends and diesel fuels was

Conclusions 
 
Our research goal is to analyze the suitability of crude Jatropha oil blends as an alternative fuels for 
the diesel generator with a stable power output. Significant reductions in kinematic viscosity, flash 
point and mid boiling point as well as increases in CFPP, calorific value, gravity and cetane index of 
CJO were achieved by simply blending with diesel in varying percentages. Results from generator 
performance tests suggested that CJO blends are found to be a promising alternative fuel source in 
diesel generator and can be directly used instead of diesel fuel for power output. Gas emission tests 
indicated that NOx and CO2 emissions were significantly reduced with the use of CJO blends 
compared to those of diesel fuels. These findings suggested that Jatropha oil blendis one of the 
possible choices to be the biofuel - using in the diesel generator without any modification of engine. 
Information from this study will be helpful to create and test a decentralized new model of electric 
energy generation using renewable plant oil and/or its blends. Further studies will be focused on the 
purification of CJO by the water/acid degumming and the membrane refinery to improve the 
Jatropha oil blends’ properties for using in the diesel generator.
