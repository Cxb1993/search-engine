中文摘要 
 
本研究以硫酸還原菌 (SRB) 為優勢菌種進行一系列水相以及土壤/水相系統的
生物降解批次實驗。在水相系統的生物降解能力研究中，主要是探討 SRB 對 
fluorene (FLU, 5 mg/L) 與 phenanthrene (PHE, 5 mg/L) 個別存在時以及混合在
一起時的降解能力。實驗結果顯示經過 21 天的反應後，SRB 可降解 88% 的 
FLU 與 65% 的 PHE。當 FLU 與 PHE 同時存在時，生物降解效率則呈現下
降的現象。綜觀所有實驗可發現硫酸鹽濃度的下降伴隨著微生物的成長以及 
FLU 與 PHE 的生物降解，顯示 SRB 是分解此兩種化合物主要的微生物族
群。由氣相層析質譜儀鑑定的結果可確認為 FLU 的代謝中間產物；2-甲基-5-
羥 基 苯 甲 醛  (2-methyl-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde) 、 1- 丙 烯 基 苯 
(1-propenyl-benzene)、對-甲酚 (p-cresol) 以及酚為 PHE 的代謝中間產物。由這
些所鑑定的代謝產物可提出以 SRB 分解 FLU 與 PHE 的新代謝途徑。在水相
系統的最適化研究中，是以可旋轉性中央合成設計法進行實驗設計探討不同影響
因子對 FLU 與 PHE 生物降解的影響。在 FLU 生物降解部份，主要是探討硫
酸鹽 (5-35 mM) 與微生物濃度 (5-50 mg/L) 對 FLU 生物降解的影響。最佳的
硫酸鹽濃度為 14.4 mM，微生物濃度為 37.8 mg/L，其 FLU 的降解百分比為
90%。在 PHE 生物降解部份，PHE 濃度的設計範圍為 2 至 50 mg/L；硫酸鹽
濃度的設計範圍為 480 至 3360 mg/L；微生物濃度的設計範圍為  5 至 50 
mg/L。實驗結果指出微生物濃度是最重要的影響因子，其次是硫酸鹽濃度與 PHE 
的濃度。本研究利用望想函數法 (DFM) 找出 PHE 的最大比去除率 (Rs)。在實
驗設計的範圍內，當初始的 PHE、硫酸鹽以及微生物濃度分別設定為 18.5、841 
與 50 mg/L 時可得到最大的 Rs (9.0 mg/g VSS-d)。最適化實驗中所觀察到的最
大 Rs 較過去相關研究來得大，證明本研究所馴養的 SRB 對於 PHE 有較佳的
生物降解能力。隨後，在此最適化條件下進行驗證實驗，其結果相當符合 DFM 
所估計的最大 Rs。此外，生物吸附實驗的結果顯示 PHE 的生物吸附與其初始
添加濃度成正比。在水相系統的代謝產物生物降解研究中，分別進行酚與對-甲
酚生物降解實驗 (添加濃度為 5 與 10 mg/L) ，實驗結果顯示對-甲酚可被快速
地分解且沒有遲滯期添加 5 mg/L 對-甲酚的實驗組在 21 天內有 87.7% 的降
解；添加 10 mg/L 對-甲酚的實驗組有 64.9% 的降解。酚則沒有明顯的降解。

Abstract 
 
A series of aqueous and soil-aqueous batch experiments were conducted using a 
sulfate reducing bacterial enrichment culture (87 ± 6%). Batch experiments were 
conducted in an aqueous system with FLU (5 mg/L), PHE (5 mg/L) and a mixture of 
the two (5 mg/L each). After 21 d, 88% of FLU and 65% of PHE were degraded by 
SRB. A decrease in biodegradation efficiency was observed in the presence of both 
FLU and PHE. Throughout the study, sulfate reduction was coupled with biomass 
growth. Hydration, hydrolysis and decarboxylation are responsible for the 
biodegradation of FLU and PHE. In the optimization study, batch biodegradation 
experiments were carried out in an aqueous system and designed using the rotatable 
central composite design. The optimal sulfate and biomass concentrations for 90% 
FLU biodegradation were 14.4 mM and 37.8 mg/L, respectively. In the PHE 
biodegradation, the biomass concentration was the most significant factor followed by 
the sulfate and PHE concentrations. The DFM was applied to find out the maximum 
specific PHE removal rate (Rs). The maximum Rs of 9.0 mg/g VSS-d
 
within the 
designed ranges was obtained when the initial PHE, sulfate and biomass 
concentrations were 18.5, 841 and 50 mg/L, respectively. In the metabolite 
biodegradation study, p-cresol was rapidly degraded without a lag phase. About 
87.7% and 64.9% p-cresol degradations were reached within 21 d at 5 mg/L and 10 
mg/L of p-cresol, respectively. A reduction in the efficiency of FLU degradation was 
observed in the presence and accumulation of phenol. In an experiment, the phenol 
and p-cresol were incubated simultaneously (5 mg/L each); the degradation of phenol 
or p-cresol is higher than their degradations in the single compound system. The 
presence of both phenol and p-cresol in the system slightly inhibited the degradation 
of PHE. Finally, batch experiments were conducted in a soil-aqueous system with a 
mixture of naphthalene, FLU, PHE, fluoranthene and pyrene at 50 μg of each PAH 
per g of soil. The optimal conditions for PAH biodegradation were: pH 4-6.5, ethanol 
concentration <35 mg/L and biomass concentration >65 mg/L. In 27 d of bench-scale 
experiments, total PAH removals by biodegradation and volatilization were 74% and 
20%, respectively. The order of PAH removal was naphthalene, PHE, FLU, 
fluoranthene and pyrene.

1. Introduction 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a recalcitrant group of contaminants 
and are composed of two or more fused benzene rings. They are mainly derived from 
coal processing and incomplete combustion of petroleum fuels (Chang et al., 2001; 
Fernandez et al., 2002; Mohan et al., 2006). The abundant sources of PAHs cause 
them to be ubiquitous in the environments such as groundwater, soil and sediment. 
The high toxicity, persistence in the environment, low volatility, resistance to 
microbial degradation, high affinity for sediments and soils, and potential 
carcinogenic effects of the PAHs cause environmental threat to humans and animals 
(Madsen et al., 1996).  
 
Biodegradation of PAHs has been well-documented under aerobic conditions with 
oxygen serving as the electron acceptor (Doong and Lei, 2003; Lei et al., 2005), 
whereas little is known about the anaerobic biodegradation of these contaminants. In 
fact, aerobic biodegradation of PAHs often leads to rapid depletion of dissolved 
oxygen and thus decreases the redox potential. Such decrease in the redox potential 
can result in favorable growth environments for denitrifying, sulfate-reducing and 
methanogenic microorganisms (Boopathy, 2004; Meckenstock et al., 2004). 
Consequently, anaerobic biodegradation/biotransformation is a promising alternative 
to aerobic treatment and is an important removal mechanism for PAHs in real 
contaminated sites. Evidence has been presented for anaerobic biodegradation of 
PAHs under nitrate-reducing (Eriksson et al., 2003; Ramsay et al., 2003), 
iron-reducing (Ramsay et al., 2003; Ramsay et al., 2005), sulfate-reducing (Coates et 
al., 1996; Rockne and Strand, 1998; Meckenstock et al., 2000; Rothermich et al., 2002; 
Lei et al., 2005) and methanogenic (Chang et al., 2006) conditions. Among these, the 
highest reported degradation rates are under sulfate-reducing conditions (Chang et al., 
2002; Boopathy, 2004). 
 
The extent and rate of degradation of PAH depend on the complex interactions 
between the contaminants, microorganisms and environmental conditions (Pieper and 
Reineke, 2000). The treatment efficiency is influenced by numerous physico-chemical 
and microbial factors such as pH, temperature, contaminant concentration, level of 
electron acceptor, biomass concentration and acclimation of microorganisms (Ramsay 
et al., 2005; Mohan et al., 2006). Previously, the effects of pH and temperature on 
PAH biodegradation under anaerobic conditions have been investigated (Yuan et al., 
2001; Chang et al., 2002). Results of these reports demonstrated that the 
biodegradation of 2-, 3- and 4-ring PAHs were the best at 30
o
C and pH 7-8. In 
addition, the contaminant (substrate) concentration can influence the efficiency of 
  3 
MgCl2·6H2O, 0.06 g/L CaCl2·6H2O, 2.84 g/L Na2SO4, 0.02 g/L FeSO4·7H2O, and 0.5 
g/L yeast extract. A mesophilic sulfate-reducing bacterial culture, initially enriched 
from the anaerobic sludge of swine wastewater, was used as the source of inoculum 
for the enrichment process. A specially-designed 1.2-L serum bottle (Schott, Germany) 
fitted with a pH and an ORP probes was used as an incubator. For enrichment, 100 
mL of bacterial culture was added into the incubator containing 900 mL of modified 
Postgate’s C medium. The mixture was purged with filter-sterilized high purity 
nitrogen gas (99.99%) for 10 min at a flow rate of 10 L/min to remove the residual 
dissolved oxygen in the medium and the pH was adjusted to 7.2  0.2. FLU and PHE 
(prepared in DMF with a concentration of 5 g/L) were added into the incubator to 
achieve a final concentration of 10 mg/L (each compound). Immediately after the 
addition of FLU and PHE, the incubator was sealed with a Teflon-lined cap and the 
headspace of the incubator was replaced with nitrogen gas. Finally, the incubator was 
placed in a temperature-controlled dark chamber at 30
o
C for 21 d. 
 
2.3. Experimental design 
2.3.1. Biodegradability study 
Six sets of biodegradation experiments were carried out simultaneously with FLU and 
PHE (single and mixture) including one biotic set, two inhibition-control sets 
(molybdate, Na2MoO4, was added on d 0 and d 6), one abiotic control set (containing 
PHE and no SRB) and two bacterial control sets. Fourteen experimental runs were 
performed in duplicate in a series of 1.2-L serum bottles (bioreactors) with a working 
volume of 1 L (Table 1). Before the experiments were started, the sulfate-reducing 
enrichment culture was grown to the mid-log growth phase (0.2 optical density at 660 
nm (OD660) = 100.2 mg/L), harvested, concentrated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 
10 min and washed thoroughly with sterilized Postgate’s C medium to remove the 
residual FLU and PHE. In the biotic experiments, 10 mL of the concentrated SRB 
suspension (approximately 1 g/L) was inoculated into the bioreactors containing 990 
mL of sterilized Postgate’s C medium resulting in an initial biomass concentration of 
10 mg/L. Prior to the addition of FLU and/or PHE, the medium was purged with 
filter-sterilized nitrogen gas for 10 min at a flow rate of 10 L/min. FLU and PHE 
prepared in DMF (5 g/L) were added to the Postgate’s C medium to achieve a final 
concentration of 5 mg/L. For studies in which FLU and PHE were added as a mixture, 
the concentrations of each were kept at 5 mg/L. The headspace was replaced with 
nitrogen gas and the bioreactors were sealed with Teflon-lined caps. Bioreactors were 
incubated for 21 d without shaking in a temperature-controlled dark chamber at 30
o
C.

2.3.2.2. PHE biodegradation in an aqueous system 
To investigate the effects of independent variables (i.e. PHE, sulfate and biomass 
concentrations) on the dependent variable (i.e. maximum specific PHE removal rate, 
Rs), the RCCD with five levels was applied and results were evaluated by the RSM 
(Virot et al., 2007; Cubas et al., 2008). Rs was calculated using the degradation rate 
versus the MLVSS yield during the incubation process. This study was conducted 
with four series of independent experiments including a biotic, an inhibition-control, 
an abiotic control and a bacterial control. The experimental design consisted of six 
star points (coded as plus and minus α), eight factorial points (coded as plus and 
minus 1) and six center points (coded as zero), resulting in twenty randomized runs 
(Table 3). The center point was repeated six times to assess the repeatability of 
experiments. The experimental range was chosen based on the results of previous 
PAH biodegradation studies (Coates et al., 1997; Rockne and Strand, 1998; Chang et 
al., 2002; Rothermich et al., 2002). The lowest and highest values given to each 
variable were 2 and 50 mg/L for the PHE concentration, 480 and 3360 mg/L for the

2.3.3. Metabolite biodegradation study 
Phenol and p-cresol biodegradation experiments by SRB were conducted following 
the procedures as stated earlier at two different concentrations, i.e. 5 and 10 mg/L. 
The sulfate and biomass concentrations for these experiments were selected based on 
the maximum Rs predicted in the optimization study. The FLU biodegradation study 
in the presence of phenol was conducted at 5 mg/L of FLU and 1 mg/L of phenol. The 
sulfate and biomass concentrations for both the experiments were selected based on 
the maximum FLU removal percentage observed in the optimization study. The 
difference between the first-order degradation rate constants of the two experiments 
(i.e., the experiment containing FLU and phenol simultaneously, and the one 
containing FLU only) was used to analyze the effect of phenol on FLU 
biodegradation. The PHE biodegradation study in the presence of phenol and p-cresol

2.3.4.3. Kinetics study 
Batch PAH biodegradation experiments were carried out using 250 mL of serum 
bottles at different concentrations of PAH (10, 50, and 100 μg/g) and biomass (7.7, 
38.5 and 61.6 mg/L). Twenty grams of soil specimen spiked with PAH and biomass 
was placed in a serum bottle and supplemented with 100 mL of modified Postgate’s C 
medium. The reactor contents were mixed well and the pH was adjusted to 7. The 
headspace of the serum bottle was purged with nitrogen gas, immediately sealed with 
butyl rubber stopper and incubated at 35
o
C with agitation at 150 rpm. At the end of 0, 
0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14 d, 2 mL of soil slurry was collected from each serum 
bottle and analyzed for PAHs concentration. 
 
2.4. Analytical methodology 
2.4.1. PAH extraction and quantification  
2.4.1.1. PAH extraction from the aqueous solution 
To determine the total residual concentrations of PAHs (PAHs in the aqueous solution 
and that adsorbed on the biomass), the cell suspension was extracted with 
  11 
flow rate of 1.6 mL/min. The injector temperature was kept at 280
o
C. The oven was 
maintained at 50
o
C for 1 min, increased at 20
o
C/min to 180
o
C, further increased at 
5
o
C/min to 280
o
C, where it was maintained at 280
o
C for 1 min. The transfer line and 
ion trap manifold were controlled at 280
o
C and 230
o
C, respectively. The detector was 
programmed to scan over a mass range of 50 to 550 mass units. Under these 
conditions, 1 L of the DCM extract was injected manually and the metabolite were 
identified by comparing their mass spectra with the reference mass spectra from the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology library and those of authentic standard 
compounds. 
 
2.4.3. HPLC 
Phenol and p-cresol concentrations were quantified by using HPLC. Prior to analysis, 
the particulates in the aqueous samples were removed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm 
for 3 min. The cell-free supernatants were analyzed in HPLC with a RP-18 
reverse-phase C18 column (250 mm length, 4.6 mm inner diameter and 5 µm particle 
size). The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of methanol and water (1:1, v:v) at a 
flow rate of 1 mL/min. Both phenol and p-cresol were detected by the measurement 
of UV absorbance at 254 nm using a single-wavelength UV-VIS detector. Compounds 
were identified by comparison of their retention times with those of authentic 
standards and were quantified using the standard curves. 
 
2.4.4. GC-TCD 
To detect methane, 0.5 mL headspace gas in the biotic runs was removed with a 
gas-tight syringe and analyzed by GC-TCD. A stainless steel column (4.57 m length 
and 0.32 cm inner diameter) packed with Carboxen 1000 (60/80 mesh, Supelco) was 
used to separate the methane. Helium was supplied as the carrier gas at a rate of 25 
mL/min. The injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 70
o
C and 80
o
C, 
respectively. The oven was set at 120
o
C. Certified methane gas standard was used for 
reference. 
 
2.4.5. Spectrophotometry 
The bacterial growth was estimated from the bacterial cell densities at various times 
measured either gravimetrically or spectrophotometrically (Kumar and Philip, 2006). 
The MLVSS measurement was made gravimetrically, according to the Standard 
Methods (Method 10200 I-5) (APHA et al., 2005). For spectrophotometric 
measurement, the bacterial pellets were obtained by centrifuging the cell suspensions 
at 6000 rpm for 10 min, resuspended and diluted in a series of dilution with 0.8% 
NaCl solution. The OD of the diluted samples was measured using a 
  13 
The hybridized cells were visualized on an epifluorescence microscope. For 
enumeration of the cells, 5 to 10 microscopic fields were randomly selected. The 
counting was performed based on the fluorescence intensity by using the digital image 
analysis software Image-Pro Plus 5.1
®
 (Washington, DC, USA) to measure the 
specific cell area after in-situ probing. The cells with fluorescence intensity higher 
than 100 were regarded as hybridized cells. Nonspecific or background fluorescence 
was manually eliminated. The relative abundance of specifically hybridized SRB was 
determined by dividing the area of hybridized cells by that of DAPI-stained cells. 
 
2.4.7. Other analytical techniques 
The pH value of aqueous solutions was measured using a pH meter. The electrode 
was calibrated using two standard stock solutions (pH 4 and 7). The ORP meter was 
used to measure the ORP of the homogenized samples. The electrode was calibrated 
using a standard stock solution with an ORP of 220 mV. For measuring the sulfate 
concentration, the sample was filtered through a 0.2-µm-pore-size nylon membrane 
filter (Advantec No. A020A047A, Japan) and the concentration was measured using 
the turbidimetric method (Method 4500-SO4
2-
-E) as described in the Standard 
Methods (APHA et al., 2005).

3.1. Results of FISH analysis 
The presence and relative abundance of SRB in the enrichment culture were 
determined by the FISH analysis. The total cell counts were performed using a DAPI 
staining approach. In the present study, two SRB enrichment cultures were tested in 
triplicate. The epifluorescence micrographs of the DAPI-stained and hybridized 
bacteria with probes EUB338, SRB385 and SRB385Db are shown in Fig. 1. The 
major portion of the detected cells was rod-shaped. Approximately 88 ± 8% of the 
total DAPI-stained cells are hybridized with the universal probe EUB338. This 
demonstrates that no false negative result has been occurred due to the 
methodological problem. Moreover, the fixation, probe penetration and rRNA content 
of bacterial cells are not the limiting factors. The assay conducted with NON338 
showed no nonspecific fluorescence. In addition, the outcome of control without 
probe (i.e. EUB338, SRB385 and SRB385Db) revealed a low autofluorescence of 
microorganisms themselves (less than 1%) (data not shown). Based on the 
observations above, the sum of SRB detected by probes SRB385 and SRB385Db was 
regarded as the total SRB population. As shown in Figs. 1(c) and (d), up to 65 ± 2% 
of the total DAPI-stained cells are hybridized by using the probe SRB385, whereas 
the probe SRB385Db hybridizes around 22 ± 4% of the total DAPI-stained cells (Figs. 
  15 
were determined based on their total concentrations (PAHs remained in the aqueous 
solution and that adsorbed on biomass) at d 0 and d 21. In Fig. 2, more than 60% of 
FLU and PHE removals can be seen at the end of d 6 and d 12, respectively, in the 
biotic systems. However, no significant degradation of FLU and PHE was observed in 
the inhibition-control (d 0) and abiotic controls. Comparatively, a lower FLU and 
PHE removals were observed in the molybdate-added systems then the biotic systems. 
This demonstrates that SRB are the major group of microorganisms involved in the 
degradation of FLU and PHE. This observation is in good agreement with the FISH 
results. After 21 d of incubation, almost 90% of FLU was degraded whereas only 66% 
of PHE was degraded in the biotic systems (without any inhibition).  
 
From Fig. 2, it is clear that a two-phase degradation was observed in the biotic runs. 
The degradation rates of both FLU and PHE showed a rapid initial phase from 0 to 9 
d (represented as k1) followed by a slower and longer phase from d 10 to 21 
(represented as k2). The degradation rate constants of FLU and PHE in the biotic runs 
were determined by using a first-order kinetic equation (Chang et al., 2002). The 
kinetic coefficients of FLU and PHE are summarized in Table 5. As seen in this table, 
the degradation rates of FLU and PHE in the single compound systems in the first 
stage (k1) were 0.136 and 0.090/d, respectively, and 0.091 and 0.011/d for the second 
stage (k2). When both FLU and PHE were present in the system, the k1 of FLU and 
PHE were reduced to 0.098 and 0.072/d, respectively. The degradation rates of FLU 
and PHE were higher in the single compound system compared to the mixed one. 
This particular observation contradicts with the results of Yuan et al. (2001), where 
they reported that FLU biodegradation was enhanced in the presence of PHE. The 
reason for this observation is the inhibition of microbial activity by the higher total 
PAH concentrations. 
 
The addition of molybdate at d 0 (runs 4-6) completely inhibited the degradation of 
FLU and PHE. In other separate experiments (runs 7-9), molybdate was added at the 
end of d 6 in order to examine the response of highly active SRB towards inhibition. 
Both FLU and PHE biodegradation rates were reduced drastically following the 
application of molybdate into the systems. In addition, no methane production was 
observed in any of the biotic runs. These results infer that sulfate is the predominant 
terminal electron acceptor and the removals of FLU and PHE are mainly resulted 
from the activity of SRB. 
 
  17 
in the single compound systems increased from 0.01 to 0.16 (corresponds to 10-80 
mg/L). The rapid bacterial growth in the systems is in good correlation with the FLU 
and PHE degradations (Fig. 2). Comparison of these results with the abiotic and 
inhibition-control systems demonstrates that FLU and PHE are biodegraded mainly 
by the microbial action. Conversely, no bacterial cell growth was observed in the 
inhibition-control systems. In the other control experiment, i.e. molybdate addition at 
the end of d 6, the increase in the bacterial cell density ceased immediately after the 
addition of molybdate. This observation indicates that SRB are the predominant 
bacteria in the biotic systems. The bacterial cell density measured in the mixture 
compound system was lower than the bacterial cell density in the single compound 
systems at the end of d 21 (Fig. 3(c)). This shows that the initial PAH concentration 
has direct influence on the SRB growth rate. In addition, FLU and PHE 
biodegradation by the SRB is predominant when the target PAH is inoculated 
individually rather than in a mixture.  
 
3.2.3. Sulfate reduction 
Sulfate is utilized as a final electron acceptor during the PAH biodegradation by SRB. 
Biodegradation in these systems can be estimated from the sulfate consumption. 
Experimental results showed that sulfate reduction was observed in biotic, 
inhibition-control (d 6) and bacterial control reactors. A sulfate reduction of 8.8-17.8% 
was recorded in these systems (Table 6). However, no change in sulfate concentration 
was observed in the abiotic and inhibition-control (d 0) systems. These results 
demonstrate that PAHs are biodegraded concurrently while sulfate is reduced in the 
biotic experiments.  
 
The sulfate reduction and FLU and PHE degradation percentages in all the systems 
are shown in Table 6. The maximum sulfate reduction was observed when PHE was 
added as a single compound in the biotic system whereas the lowest sulfate reduction 
was observed when neither FLU nor PHE was added in the system. The result of 
bacterial control experiment with addition of DMF and without FLU and PHE showed 
12.5% sulfate reduction indicating the partial degradation of yeast extract and DMF. 
This would mean that 0.8% (13.3% – 12.5%) of the sulfate reduction is related to 
FLU biodegradation.

3.3.1.1. Results of RCCD experiments 
Table 7 shows the outcomes of RCCD experiments. A maximum FLU removal of 
89% was observed under the experimental conditions of run 8 (sulfate ~ 20 mM; 
biomass ~ 50 mg/L). A minimum FLU removal of 57% was observed in run 4 with 
the lowest biomass concentration i.e., 5 mg/L. On the other hand, no appreciable loss 
of FLU was observed in the inhibition and abiotic controls. Comparison of runs 4 and 
8 demonstrates that FLU removal can be increased with the increase in biomass 
concentration. Based on the results of RCCD, an empirical second-order polynomial 
model was developed as shown in Eq. (1). 
 
R = 43.074 + 1.078 A + 1.957 B–0.032 A2–0.024 B2–0.005 AB            (1)            
 
Where, R is FLU removal (%), A is sulfate concentration (mM) and B is biomass 
concentration (mg/L). The Eq. (1) can be useful to predict the FLU removal for a 
biodegradation study operated under the designed ranges.

concentration applied, it is observed that the Rs increases from 4.7 to 6.2 mg/g VSS-d 
as the PHE concentration increases from 2 to 26 mg/L, whereas it decreases to 2.9 
mg/g VSS-d at 50 mg/L PHE. The decrease in Rs beyond a PHE concentration of 26 
mg/L indicates the possible inhibitory effect on the microbial activity. Furthermore, 
lower Rs is observed when the sulfate concentration is maintained at higher levels 
(>1200 mg/L). This reflects the inhibition of microorganism enzyme synthesis under 
high sulfate concentration (Yuan et al., 2001). The highest Rs of 6.8 mg/g VSS-d is 
predicted for the combination of a PHE concentration between 5 and 28 mg/L and a 
sulfate concentration between 480 and 1000 mg/L. The variation of Rs as a function 
of biomass and sulfate concentrations is illustrated in Fig. 4-6(b). The Rs is affected 
more by the biomass concentration than the sulfate concentration. The effect of 
biomass concentration on Rs produces an expected result, i.e. the increase in biomass 
leads to an increase in Rs. The highest Rs of 7.8 mg/g VSS-d is observed when the 
biomass and sulfate concentrations are in the range of 45-50 mg/L and 480-1500 
mg/L, respectively. Similar Rs is obtained when the biomass and PHE concentrations 
are in the range of 45-50 mg/L and 2-30 mg/L, respectively (Fig. 4-6(c)). 
 
In order to determine the optimal conditions for PHE biodegradation, the DFM was 
applied and fifteen solutions are obtained as shown in Table 10. The solution 7 has 
shown the highest predicted Rs of 9.0 mg g
-1
 VSS d
-1
. The natural values 
corresponding to highest predicted Rs are 18.5 mg/L for PHE concentration, 841 mg/L 
for sulfate concentration and 50 mg/L for biomass concentration. Table 11 compares 
the Rs obtained in this study with the literature data. The Rs values vary considerably 
across the literatures, which can be attributed to the differences in the initial PHE 
concentrations, electron acceptors, and bacterial genus/species. In the study conducted 
by Rockne and Strand (1998), the Rs was 0.09-0.15 mg/g VSS-d when sulfate was 
used as the electron acceptor. Approximately, the Rs values are an order of magnitude 
greater (0.9-1.3 mg/g VSS-d) under nitrate-reducing conditions. In another study by 
Rockne and Strand (2001) with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor, a Rs of 0.15 
mg/g VSS-d was reported. The direct comparison of the Rs values in Table 11 is 
unsuitable to identify the best biodegradation efficiency between these studies. The 
high Rs values of this study (2.4-7.6 mg/g VSS-d) demonstrate the superiority of the 
enriched SRB culture used in this study.

estimated by the model is around 15%. Furthermore, the biotic runs were carried out 
in duplicate. The Rs might not been consistent since these two systems were different 
in terms of microbial growth and substrate removal rates. 
 
In order to support the coupling of PHE oxidation with sulfate reduction, a theoretical 
stoichiometric equation was formed assuming a complete oxidation of PHE to carbon 
dioxide. The oxidation half-reaction of PHE, and reduction half-reaction of sulfate 
based on one electron equivalent basis are shown as Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively.

The stoichiometry of PHE degradation and sulfate reduction is determined from the 
ratio of the mass of the sulfate consumed to the mass of PHE degraded at the end of 
the experimental period. As per Eq. (5), the theoretical ratio of sulfate reduction to 
PHE removal is 8.25. The actual ratios obtained from the confirmation experiments 
are shown in Table 12. In biotic run 1, the theoretical sulfate reduction based on the 
mass of PHE degraded (0.07 mM) was 0.58 mM, whereas the actual sulfate reduction 
was 1.37 mM. This implies that sulfate might have utilized as a terminal electron 
acceptor in the removal of additional organic compounds present in the medium, i.e. 
yeast extract and DMF. On the other hand, 0.87 mM of sulfate reduction was observed 
in the bacterial control system with the addition of yeast extract and DMF indicating 
that a portion of bacterial growth was from the utilization of these organic compounds. 
The mechanism of co-metabolism is envisaged in this degradation process. This 
indicates that the difference in sulfate reduction between biotic (1.37 mM) and 
bacterial control (0.87 mM) systems is directly related to the PHE oxidation; the 
amount of sulfate reduction (0.50 mM) was nearly equivalent to the stoichiometric 
amount of PHE degraded with a ratio of 7.18. A ratio of 7.14 was calculated for biotic 
run 1 and 7.18 for biotic run 2. 
  31 
In another separate study, a set of biosorption experiments were conducted in 
duplicate with live SRB biomass. The effect of PHE concentration on the biosorption 
capacity of SRB was investigated by varying the initial PHE concentrations from 5 to 
50 mg/L and keeping the sulfate and biomass concentrations under the optimal levels 
obtained from the optimization study. The biosorption percentages for different initial 
PHE concentrations are summarized in Table 14. The data indicate that the sorption 
capacity of PHE by resident biomass increases with the increase in the initial PHE 
concentration over the range tested. The biosorption percentage of PHE increased 
from 10.7 to 64.3% when the PHE concentration increased from 5 to 50 mg/L. The 
highest biosorption percentage of PHE was found in the experiment with the highest 
initial PHE concentration. A similar observation has been reported for the sorption of 
PHE onto the activated sludge biomass (Stringfellow and Alvarez-Cohen, 1999).  
 
In addition, the sorption reversibility is a critical issue in biodegradation of PAHs 
(Laor et al., 1996). If sorption is reversible, biodegradation would be dependent on the 
desorption rate. On the other hand, if sorption is irreversible but the adsorbed PAHs 
are still consumed, this means that the microorganisms can utilize the PAHs directly 
from the adsorbed phase. In the present study, when PHE was added to the cultures, 
most of it was immediately adsorbed on the biomass. About 63.5-83.5% of PHE was 
adsorbed on biomass in 1 h. This observation demonstrates that biosorption of PHE 
occurred before the metabolic reactions. Besides, the percentages of biosorption in all 
the experiments decreased with time. For example, a biosorption percentage of 63.5% 
was observed in the experiment with 5 mg/L PHE, however, by d 21 this percentage 
had decreased to 10.7% due to the biodegradation by SRB. This implies that the 
adsorbed PHE is likely to be desorbed quickly from the bound phase to aqueous 
solution over the time course of incubation for subsequent biodegradation or the 
bacteria are able to degrade the adsorbed PHE directly. Similar findings have been 
reported by Chan et al. (2006) for the removal and degradation of PHE, fluoranthene 
and pyrene with a microalgal species, i.e. Selenastrum capricornutum. Also, the report 
by Raghukumar et al. (2006) for the removal of PHE and chrysene from aqueous 
culture medium by the live or heat-killed marine fungus NIOCC # 312 indicated that 
PHE was instantly adsorbed on the fungal biomass and the adsorbed PHE was 
subsequently degraded by the live biomass. The heat-killed biomass could be used 
only for adsorption of PAHs from aqueous medium whereas use of the live biomass 
would result in further degradation of PAHs.  
 
Moreover, it should be noted that biosorption can affect the biodegradation efficiency. 
Stringfellow and Alvarez-Cohen (1999) indicated that biosorption decreased the rate

3.6.2. Biodegradation of FLU in the presence of phenol 
In a separate experiment, the versatility of phenol on FLU biodegradation was 
investigated. A gradual decrease in FLU concentration with proportionate increase in 
phenol concentration was observed in the experiment (Fig. 14). The phenol 
degradation rate is found to be 0.04 mg/L-d (data from d 3 to d 21). This result 
strongly evidences the biotransformation of FLU into phenol by the SRB. On the 
other hand, the first-order degradation rate constant without the addition of phenol 
was 0.1/d. A lower first-order degradation rate constant for FLU degradation (0.09/d) 
was observed in the presence of phenol at 1 mg/L. The decrease in FLU degradation 
rate could be due to the phenol-inhibition.

3.6.3. Biodegradation of PHE in the presence of phenol and p-cresol 
The interactions between metabolites and the effect of presence of phenol and 
p-cresol on PHE degradation were examined. The first-order degradation rate 
constants of PHE degradation (at 5 mg/L PHE concentration) were measured in the 
presence and absence of phenol and p-cresol. It can be seen from Figs. 15 to 17 that 
the phenol, p-cresol and PHE are biodegraded simultaneously. Phenol and p-cresol 
biodegradation tends in the mixture compound system are very similar to that in 
single compound systems. Comparison of Fig. 12 and Fig. 15 shows that a slight 
increase in phenol degradation was observed in the presence of p-cresol and PHE. 
When p-cresol was mixed together with phenol and PHE, almost complete 
degradation of p-cresol was recorded after 21 d (Fig. 16). Similarly, the degradation of 
p-cresol was higher in the mixture compound system than the single one. These

3.7.2. Bench-scale experiments 
Degradation profiles of naphthalene, FLU, PHE, fluoranthene and pyrene in the biotic 
run are shown in Fig. 19, and the total PAHs degradation profile is shown in Fig. 20. In 
the initial phase (d 0 to d 1), the total PAHs degradation was insignificant, which can be 
attributed to the lag phase of SRB in degrading PAHs. However, the PAHs degradation 
increased rapidly from d 1 to d 4.5, and the total PAHs removal percentage at the end of 
this period was around 75%. After 13.5 d, the total PAHs degradation remained 
unchanged. The observed maximum PAH degradation percentages were 96%, 95%, 
95%, 93% and 93% for naphthalene, FLU, PHE, fluoranthene and pyrene, respectively 
at the end of 27 d (Fig 19) and the corresponding total PAHs degradation was 94% (Fig. 
20). Initially (at the end of 2 d), the percentage removals of both fluoranthene and 
pyrene were nearly 3%. Thereafter, the percentage removals were increased rapidly and 
they were close to the percentage removals of naphthalene and FLU at the end of the 
experiment. This reflects the ability of enriched SRB culture in the degradation of both 
low and high molecular weight PAHs. From abiotic control data, it was observed that 
53%, 17%, 19%, 12% and 12% of naphthalene, FLU, PHE, fluoranthene and pyrene, 
respectively were removed by volatilization at the end of 27 d, which corresponds to a 
total PAHs removal of 23%. Therefore, percentages of naphthalene, FLU, PHE, 
fluoranthene and pyrene removed by biodegradation were 43%, 78%, 76%, 81% and 
81%, respectively, corresponding to a total PAHs biodegradation of 72% at the end of 
27 d.   
In the present study, sulfate is utilized as an electron acceptor and consumed by SRB for 
its growth. In both bench-scale biotic and abiotic experiments, the initial sulfate 
concentration was 1250 mg/L. At the end of experiment, the sulfate concentration was 
reduced to 1100 mg/L in BR whereas no significant change in the sulfate concentration 
was observed in abiotic control (Fig. 20). The sulfate reduction in biotic run was in 
good correlation with the total PAHs removal (Fig. 20). A rapid decrease in sulfate 
concentration was observed in biotic run between 1 d and 4.5 d. During this period, the 
percentage removals of fluoranthene and pyrene were increased from 3% to 75% (Fig. 
19). The decrease in sulfate concentration was slowed down between 4.5 d and 10 d, 
and thereafter, remained almost a constant. These observations indicate that PAHs 
biodegradation is significantly related to the sulfate reduction.
  49 
3.7.3. Kinetics experiments 
In order to obtain the PAHs biodegradation kinetics, batch experiments were conducted 
at various initial PAH and biomass concentrations. The first-order coefficient of PAHs 
biodegradation at different initial biomass and PAHs concentrations are shown in Figs. 
21 and 22, respectively. From the experimental data, it was observed that the ratio of 
PAHs biodegradation increased in the range of 10 to 50 μg PAHs/g of soil (irrespective 
of the initial biomass concentration). In contrast, a decrease in PAHs biodegradation 
ratio was observed in the range of 50 to 100 μg PAHs/g of soil. Although the initial 
PAHs concentration varied widely, the degradation of similar molecular weight PAHs 
in the present study (i.e. fluoranthene and pyrene) remained as a constant. Degradation 
profiles of naphthalene,FLU, PHE, fluoranthene and pyrene were similar at the initial 
PAHs concentration of 10 and 50 μg PAHs/g of soil (Figs. 22(a) and (b)), whereas 
decreases in PAHs removal were observed at the elevated initial PAHs concentration, 
i.e. 100 μg PAHs/g of soil (Fig. 22(c)). These findings reflect that the PAHs degradation 
ratio depends on the initial PAH concentration to a certain extent irrespective of the 
biomass concentration.

4.2 Recommendations for future work 
Based on the findings of the present study, a few points of suggestion are summarized 
as follows: 
1. Further research is necessary to evaluate the effects of factors other than pH, 
Presence of auxiliary substrates (i.e. ethanol), substrate, electron donor and 
biomass concentrations on the PAH biodegradation rate. This knowledge can be 
used to provide a complete understanding of the biodegradation rate in a complex 
system conditions. 
2. The toxicities of PAH, phenol and p-cresol to SRB have to be investigated. 
3. Further research is required to conclusively establish the metabolic pathways of 
FLU, PHE, fluoranthene and pyrene by SRB.

Abstract 
Anaerobic biodegradation of phenanthrene (PHE) was investigated using an 
enrichment culture consists predominantly of sulfate-reducing bacteria (87 ± 6%). 
Aqueous biodegradation experiments were designed using the rotatable central 
composite design with five levels. The designed concentrations were 2-50 mg L
-1
 for 
PHE, 480-3360 mg L
-1 
for sulfate, and 5-50 mg L
-1
 for initial biomass. Experimental 
results indicated that the biomass concentration was the most significant variable, 
followed by the sulfate and PHE concentrations. The desirability functions 
methodology (DFM) was applied to find out the maximum specific PHE removal rate 
(Rs). The maximum Rs of 9.0 mg g
-1
 VSS d
-1
 within the designed ranges was obtained 
when the initial PHE, sulfate and biomass concentrations were 18.5, 841 and 50 mg 
L
-1
, respectively. The Rs observed in the present study was higher than the values 
reported in the previous studies. Subsequently, a confirmation study was performed 
under the optimal conditions, and the results matched well with the Rs estimated using 
DFM. Samples collected during PHE biodegradation experiments inferred the 
formation of two novel metabolic intermediates, 2-methyl-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde 
and 1-propenyl-benzene, and subsequently degraded to p-cresol, phenol and 
hydrocarbons.

Abstract 
In the present study, the potential of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
biodegradation by sulfate-reducing bacterial consortium enriched from piggery 
wastewater was investigated. The batch experiments of soil-applied PAH 
biodegradation were conducted with a mixture of PAHs, i.e. naphthalene, fluorene, 
phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene, at a concentration of 50 μg of each PAH per g 
of soil. A central composite design (CCD) was applied to determine the experimental 
conditions of each batch assay. The pH, biomass and ethanol concentrations were 
selected as independent variables and the PAH removal percentage was considered as 
a dependent variable. The optimal conditions for PAH biodegradation were found to 
be a pH between 4 and 6.5, an ethanol concentration less than 35 mg/L and a biomass 
concentration greater than 65 mg/L. Bench scale experiments were carried out at the 
optimal conditions. At the end of experiment (27 d), total PAH removals by 
biodegradation and volatilization were around 74% and 20%, respectively. The order 
of PAH removal was naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. 
Throughout the study, PAH biodegradation was in good correlation with sulfate 
reduction. The results of kinetics study indicated a competitive inhibition between 
PAHs investigated.
