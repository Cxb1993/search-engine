1. Introduction 
Since Wright brothers Flyer design over 100 years ago, the quest for 
faster and faster airplanes has been a driving force in aeronautics. People 
has recognized the military and commercial benefits of decreasing the 
time it takes to travel between two points, and air travel has always 
offered the most potential for improvements in the time-distance 
equation. 
Airplane let us to enjoy more convenience, but now it will have to 
change because the earth resource become less and less. In the past, many 
aviation achievements have been made with new design, one of the most 
important is the development of the B747, which defined the 
configuration of modern civil aircraft like the combination cylindrical 
fuselage with swept wings and tail planes. Although today aircraft look 
rather traditional to those of 50 years ago, they improve aerodynamic 
performance, flight control system, engine fuel efficiency, and the 
structure integrity, the latest example being the Airbus A380 aircraft. On 
the other hand, the basic design and configuration have remained the 
same and this has meant that any further substantial improvements are 
much more difficult.  
Considering this fact, alternative designs are now being investigated 
for significant improvement in operating costs and environmental issues, 
such as fuel and noise. For conventional large transport aircraft, a

Among numerous factors that influence the aircraft during take-off 
and landing, these serious factors includes crosswind, low level wind 
shear, heavy rain. More often, it didn’t have the time to take any action 
because the incident was happened so quickly. Due to this reason, we 
shall pay more attention to how the flight environment can influence 
aircraft performance during the take-off and landing phase. 
Airplane flight through heavy rain has been postulated to be a reason 
in several weather conditions associated with aerodynamic penalty. Even 
today, with modern weather radar aboard commercial aircraft to improve 
weather forecasting. Heavy rain rates above about 1800 mm/hr on 
commercial airplane significantly affect performance, say lift decrease 
down to 30% and drag increase up to 20%. 
The vehicle lacks the typical configuration of control surfaces used 
in conventional aircraft, such as a rudder and elevator in a separate tail. It 
is very important that the aircraft be statically stable in flight. However, 
extreme stability can have adverse effects on maneuverability and 
performance. The static stability of the aircraft is considering each of the 
three direction of motion separately.  
This paper is to investigate the feasibility of applying CFD methods 
to aerodynamic analyses and stability for Blended Wing Body with 
Fluent. The first step is verification coefficient of pressure for M-6 wing 
at cruise condition which making sure to simulate Blended Wing Body. 
Second step is conducted to investigate the coefficient of lift and drag

2. Research Background 
Unconventional aircraft configurations, such as Blended Wing Body 
are being investigated and researched to develop more efficient aircraft. 
Flying wing designs are defined as having no separate body, only a single 
wing, even if there may be structures protruding from the wing. But the 
flying wing configuration is not a new concept; in 1929 the first example 
of a Blended Wing Body design was researched. The Junkers G. 38 [3], 
the largest airplane in the world at the same time, it was planned and used 
in Germany as a passenger plane, then later as a military transport. 
Wingspan of G.38 measured 44 m and four engines gave a maximum 
speed of 185 km/h. The airplane had unique symbolization; the 
passengers were seated for 34 passengers, some of them in the wing roots. 
This design for airplane transport was developed leading up to World War 
II. 
 
Figure 2-1: G.38 [3] 
7 
Cardenas, an Air Force test pilot, delivered a report which indicated the 
YB-49 was extremely unstable and very difficult to fly on a bombing 
mission. Because of the continual yawing and the pitching was not on 
control. 
 
Figure 2-3: YB49 [5] 
In the 1980s, NASA developed and improved advanced technology 
subsonic transports of Blended Wing Body. In particular airplane for very 
large transport aircraft that are more efficient and environmentally 
friendly. The Blended Wing Body configuration where the wing and 
fuselage are blending which like flying wing shape. 
In 1988, The B-2 Spirit [6] was publicly displayed by U.S. Air Force. 
A multi-role bomber was capable of delivering both conventional and 
nuclear munitions. According to blended with fuselage and wing, B2 has 
better lift in the same condition. So B2 can carry more bombs on the 
mission.  Its low-observable characteristics give it the unique ability to

considered to an 800 passenger capacity, cruising at Mach 0.85 and a 
7000 nm range. The Blended Wing Body had a double deck cabin that 
extends spanwise providing structural overlap with the wing. This 
reduces the total area of the airplane and allows a long wingspan to be 
achieved, because of the deep and stiff center body provides efficient 
structural wingspan.  
 
Figure 2-5: The Boeing BWB-450 baseline [7] 
In 2006, Leifsson and Mason [8] compared the Boeing BWB-450 
with the Airbus A380-700 were given in Table 2-1. Both airplanes are 
compared for a payload of approximately 480 passengers and a range of 
8,700 nm. The most noticeable result is the Blended Wing Body 32% 
lower fuel burn per seat. Both airplanes are using equivalent technology 
engines of similar thrust levels, but the A380-700 needs four and the 
Blended Wing Body only three. Blended Wing Body shows a significant 
advantage over a conventional aircraft in terms of performance and 
11 
 
 
Figure 2-6: Coefficient of lift thickness to chord ratio over the wing span. [7] 
In 2002, Qin, et al. [9] presented the main aerodynamic advantages 
of the new Blended Wing Body design are its lower wetted area to 
volume ratio and lower interference drag as compared to the conventional 
aircraft. Indeed, an increase in lift to drag maximum of about 20% over 
the conventional design has been estimated for the blended wing body. 
However these benefits can only be realized as improved aerodynamic 
performance through careful and detailed aerodynamic shape design. 
The importance of span loading distribution for Blended Wing Body 
performance has been highlighted from the results of the present research. 
At the design transonic cruise and lift condition for the present Blended 
Wing Body, wave drag has been found to be a significant component of 
the total drag. Therefore the span loading distribution giving minimum 
induced drag does not necessarily produce minimum total aerodynamic 
13 
considering each of the three direction of motion separately.  
 
Figure 2-7: The six-degree-of-freedom for a rigid airplane [13] 
In 1997, David E. Hahne [14] presented the experiment data, effect 
of the configuration components on the longitudinal aerodynamic 
characteristics on the body-wing. The body-wing and the 
body-wing-nacelle configurations, the influence of a strong leading-edge 
vortex can be seen in both the lift and pitching-moment coefficients. The 
effect of the configuration components on lateral-directional aerodynamic 
characteristics is presented. As would be expected for a configuration 
with such a highly swept planform; the level of lateral stability increases 
with angle of attack to quite high values. These high levels of lateral 
stability may have an adverse impact on landing operations in crosswind 
without vertical tails. As angle of attack is increased, the vertical tails 
tend to force the leading edge vortices to burst over the wing, which 
reduces lateral stability even further d conditions. 
15 
 
Figure 2-8: The pitching moment of airplane [15] 
Lateral stability 
Lateral stability is the rolling motion about airplane longitudinal axis, 
which extends from nose to tail. If a temporary gust wind change one 
wing of the airplane to rise and the other side to lower, the airplane will 
tilt. Positive stability in this case means that increases the lift on the low 
wing and decreases lift on the high wing, that will tends to restore the 
airplane to its original lateral attitude. If airplane has excessive lateral 
stability, the airplane may be so stable laterally that will cause resists any 
on purpose rolling motion. For this reason, airplanes that require roll or 
tilting characteristics usually have less maneuverable when it designed. 
The lateral stability coefficient is defined as  
 
Conversely, the rolling motion of the aircraft in response at angle of 
β which respect to the airplane flight direction is a measure of the lateral 
stability.

2-3 Heavy Rain on Airfoil 
In this research, it concluded that heavy rain has a significant effect 
when an airplane in landing configuration. Weather has always been a 
serious problem in aviation safety. Even today, with modern weather 
radar aboard commercial aircraft to improve weather forecasting. The 
aerodynamic consequence associated with aircraft flight through rain 
recently has been postulated to be a connecting cause in several severe 
weather accidents. Weather remains a cause of related factor on a high 
percentage of aircraft accident.  
In 1941, Rhode and Richard [16] had been to present the effect of 
rain on aircraft. The earliest analytical work indicated McDonnell 
Douglas DC-3 aircraft encountering a rain with liquid water content of 50 
g/m3, which drag increase associated with the moment. Low visibility 
19 
is quite dilute. 
For accentuate the raindrop diameter, spectrums have been measured 
to be in the range 0.1-6.0 mm, 4.0 mm is the average diameter of heavy 
rain. The 6.0 mm raindrop is the larger diameter associated with heaviest 
rainfalls. Mean distance between raindrops corresponding to heavy rain 
that is 7 cm. 
In 1989, Campbell and Bezos [20] presented the performance of 
airfoil. The experimental results of the laminar flow airfoils indicated 
that the rain caused premature transition from a laminar to a turbulent 
boundary layer. Both the heavy rain laminar and turbulent flow on 
airfoils will decrease lift and increase drag. The rain environment 
included an early separation in both the laminar and turbulent flow. 
It conducted rain effect sensitivity of airfoil geometry on an 
NACA64210 airfoil. An improved rain simulation system produced liquid 
water contents range from 16 to 46 g/m3. NACA 64210 airfoil 
experienced significant decrease in maximum lift and increase drag with 
increasing liquid water content at the curies and landing configurations. 
The landing configuration was more sensitive to the rain environment 
than the curies configuration. 
The landing configuration considered about a leading edge slat and 
trailing edge double-slotted flap. Experienced a 22 percent reduction in 
maximum lift with angle of attack is 8 degree, decreasing the stall angle 
21 
development of the boundary layer, resulting in a loss of lift and can be 
contributed to early flow separation. 2. Film-Convection Region: this 
region is described convection of a surface water film. Surface water on 
the boundary-layer flow is dragged downstream by friction. Some surface 
waves of convection will cause to a smooth laminar film change into 
turbulence. The effect of this phenomenon is to change the location of 
mean-streamline detachment with associated reductions in lift and rise in 
drag. 3. Rivulet-Formation Region: this region is described the water film, 
separated to rivulets and beads. Rivulets and beads are similar to those 
found in water film flow down inclined surface. Different flow rate will 
cause rivulet to different sinuosity, wavelength, and amplitude of the 
waves. The distance between two moving droplets becomes a single 
straight laminar rivulet when they touch at a point. 4. Droplet-Convection 
Region: this region is described the meandering rivulets are no longer 
stable and the beads slide slowly dragged by the airflow and coalescing 
with other beads. Every part of the water is dragged to the trailing edge 
and torn away by the external flow. The transfer of momentum in this 
region is dominated by the flow structure at the trailing edge. 
In 2009, Wan and Pan [23] used FLUENT to simulate NACA 64210 
of rain compared with Bezos [20] experimental data. In the article, 
experimental data for liquid water content 25 g/m3 and liquid water 
content 39 g/m3 cases, the tendency about lift coefficient was decreased 
and drag was increased with angle of attack.

Figure 3-2 Blended Wing Body geometry model in 3D 
Our Blended Wing Body consists of two part, center body and outer 
wing. The center body is from 0 to 13 m span, and the payload is 
accommodation of passengers and cargo. The inner wing is from 13 to 
23.5 m and this part of wing will host fuel tanks. Outer wing is from 23.5 
to 38.75 m and then joins to winglet at the wingtip. Figure 3-3 is the 
airfoil for the section at y=0.0, 6.0 m and y=0.0, -6.0m. 
 
Figure 3-3 The airfoil section profile at y=0.0, 6.0 and y=0.0, -6m 
25 
The airfoil for the outer wing is at y=17.5, 23.5, 38.75 m and y= 
-17.5, -23.5, -38.75 m, which is composed of supercritical airfoil which is 
design for transonic performance. Figure 3-5 is the outer wing of airfoil 
section profile. 
The winglet makes up a linear interpolation of NACA 0012 airfoil 
joining to outlet wing. The average airfoil thickness to chord ratio 
distribution at different span location is approximate 17% in the center 
body, and reach to maximum of 18% at 6 m span location. The twist 
distribution of the airfoil/wing profile is that near center body and outer 
wing it twisted downward, and at the inner wing it twists the opposite 
angle upward about the leading edge. Figure 3-6 is the twist angle 
distribution of the airfoil/wing.

The leading edge sweep angle swept back 63.8 degree for center 
body and swept back 38 degree for outer wing. The area of Blended Wing 
Body project a shadow area of 1512.48 m2 for aerodynamic coefficient 
27 
At first, Blended Wing Body has a complicated shape; unstructured 
mesh will be easily to generate than structured mesh. After testing the 
mesh of 3.2, 3.6, 3.9, 4.36 million unstructured grids, the 4.36 million 
structure grid has the best lift to drag 15.82. The mesh constructed in the 
work is shown below:

Finally, in this case chooses structure mesh because it has the best 
lift to drag which can control Y plus distributing to 100~450 at 0.85 Mach 
number and distributes to 7~40 at free stream velocity 49.4774 m/s.

incompressible for steady flow which the Mach number is below 0.3.But 
above the Mach number 0.3, the flow is said to be compressible because 
the density of a flowfield will change during its motion. Navier-Stokes 
equation for compressible may then be written as a 
Continuity equation: 
  …………………………… (3-3.1) 
Momentum equation: 
                (3-3.2) 
Energy equation: 
                     (3-3.3)      
The incompressible flow is no having the equation of state for 
pressure which is unlike in compressible flow. Since there is no separate 
equation for pressure, it must be obtained from the continuity and 
momentum equations. The main role of pressure is to satisfy the zero 
divergence condition of the velocity field. Note that pressure is only 
determined up to a constant. If the viscosity assumed to be constant, then 
the energy equation is decoupled from the continuity and momentum 
equations.  
3-4 Turbulence Model 
33 
representation of the flow in the near-wall region determines successful 
predictions of wall-bounded turbulent flows. 
Numerous experiments have shown that the near-wall region can be 
largely subdivided into three layers. In the innermost layer, called the 
viscous sublayer, the flow is almost laminar, and the viscosity plays a 
dominant role in momentum and heat or mass transfer. In the outer layer, 
called the fully-turbulent layer, turbulence plays a major role. Finally, 
there is an interim region between the viscous sublayer and the fully 
turbulent layer where the effects of molecular viscosity and turbulence 
are equally important. 
3-5 Crosswind 
 In this study is caring about airplane taking-off and landing 
longitudinal stability, lateral stability and directional stability with free 
stream velocity is 49.4774 m/s. In the beginning, Fluent can simulate 
moment coefficient at x, y, z axis with reference point. We choose 
crosswind of 10 m/s, 20 m/s and 30 m/s in this work. Longitudinal 
stability is according to angle of attack 0~12. After this guesses, sideslip 
angle is the angle of nose actual directions when airplane rolling or 
yawing, which will be change it original direction with side velocity. 
According this function and considering different crosswind condition, 
three angles are angle of 11.426, 22.010 and 31.230. After calculated 
the side slip angle, next step is determining reference point. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For DPM input parameters in Fluent, it needs to input the particle 
diameter, velocity and mass flow rate for every injection point. At the 
first, setting particle diameter is 4 mm and each particle distance is 7 cm. 
Particle velocity must set to terminal velocity 8.81 m/s which are 
according to particle diameter. The injection plane is 60.2 m× 10.01 m, 
and the free stream velocity is 49.4774 m/s. According this volume flow 
rate is 60.2m× 10.01m × 49.48 m/s =29745.8425 m3 /s. In this study, the 
rain rate is at LWC=39 g/m3, the mass flow rate is 29745.8425 m3/s×39 
g/m3 = 1160.0879 kg/s. Because distance of each particle is 7 cm, particle 
number is

three-dimensional aerospace configurations with reliable boundary

to confirm how the reliable boundary condition in CFD is. According this

After this work, Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 show shows the relationship 
between the coefficients of lift and drag for the Blended Wing Body in 
the simulation. The coefficient of lift for the simulation data follows a 
linear trend with respect to the angle of attack for angles below 8 degrees 
by Figure 4-1. Towards higher angles of attack, the graph resembles a 
more quadratic trend. This nonlinearity is due to the onset of stall as the 
angle of attack increases. Due to the viscosity of the flow, the flow begins 
to separate over the top of the wing surface at higher angles of attack, 
leading to a decrease in lift. It is the same tendency for coefficient of drag. 
45 
 
Figure 4-3 The CL vs. CD with free stream velocity 49.4774m. 
As knowing, the drag composed of pressure and skin fraction drag. 
At cruise condition, the pressure drag is large than viscous drag because 
the velocity is very faster. In Qin[11] result, the total drag is composed of 
77% pressure drag and 23% skin friction drag which the best lift to drag 
is at angle of attack 3o. In our study, the total drag is composed of 70.19% 
pressure drag and 29.81% skin friction drag which the best lift to drag at 
angle of attack 2o. Comparing with this data, the rate of angle of attack 
increase reduces with the incidence while the rate of pressure drag 
increase goes up. Figure 4-4 shows the curve of tendency.

According to this result, the invicd case and viscous case have the

stability with different crosswinds speed. But at the angle of attack 10, 
crosswind speed of 10m/s is stable lateral and directional stability; it is

Lateral stability is the rolling motion about airplane longitudinal axis. 
Positive stability in this case means that increases the lift on the low wing 
and decreases lift on the high wing, that will tends to restore the airplane 
to its original lateral attitude. According this simulation data, Cl and Cn 
approach zero without crosswind. But with different crosswind speeds, 
value has changed in dissimilar tendency. At angle of attack 0, rolling 
moment is decreased when crosswind speed increase. The slope of Cl by 
Figure 4-8 which means  As can be seen at angles of attack 
above 0, observing for this phenomenon, when increasing crosswind 
speed, the rolling moment is also increased, it means unstable lateral 
stability with different crosswind speeds. This unstable lateral stability 
may have an adverse impact on landing operations in crosswind 
conditions.

increased. This tendency means  The angles of attack above 0, 
the yawing moment is decreased when crosswind speed increase, which it 
means unstable directional stability with different crosswind speeds.

To base on simulation data for liquid water content 25 g/m3 and 
39g/m3, the tendency by Figure 4-12 and 4-13 for coefficient of lift will 
be decreased and coefficient of drag will be increased. Comparing with 
two rain rates, the influence of blended wing body is more and more 
severe when liquid water content level becomes large. After this work, we 
also want to recognize what the different with Cp contour in different rain 
rates. Figure 4-14 to 4–17 shows the Cp contour in different airfoil the 
sections. However, two rain rates are more consistent compare to lift 
decrease and drag increase. Table 4-19, Figure 4-18 and Figure 4-19 
show coefficient of lift decreased and drag increased to discuss this result.

drag; the drag addition is not followed with angle of attack. Coefficient of 
drag maximum addition is on angle of attack 60. As knowing the best lift 
to drag is on angle of attack 4 degree with free stream velocity 49.4774 
m/s. For observing this situation with heavy rain, the maximum drag 
addition will be happened nearly best lift to drag. No matter liquid water 
content 25 g/m3 or 39 g/m3, the two tendencies are the same.

data, lift to drag degradation on angle of attack 4 degree at liquid water 
content 25 g/m3 and 39 g/m3 are 4.42% and 11.08%. This result show 
aerodynamic performance which will be more influence when heavy rain 
becoming more and more severe. Figure 4-21 shows bar chart of the lift

Fig 4-22 shows the angle of attack 4 degree local view of rain 
distribution in the DPM model which in order to explain the heavy rain 
simulation for Fluent. Particles terminal velocity and free stream velocity 
will combine new component velocity when particles come into flowfield. 
Because guessing the particles diameter is 4 mm, particles impact to 
Blended Wing Body which will splash and become a lot of new particles. 
This new particles are not in the same size comparing with original 
particles. The number of particles are more than twenty millions, Figure 
4-22 only can show one-tenth particles number in flowfield.

5. Conclusions 
  In this study, we have completed one's work which is the full 
Blended Wing Body simulation and achieved the best lift to drag ratio as 
17.808 which cruises the sky at 12 kilometer altitude with 0.85 Mach 
number. After this preliminary work, simulated taking-off and landing 
conditions which the best lift to drag is 23.9269 at angle of attack 40. 
Blended Wing Body at different situation, the best lift to drag will be 
change with angle of attack. According to this simulation, the pitch angle 
is increasing which longitudinal stability will be stable no matter at cruise 
and take-off/land. The pitching moment curves from the simulation show 
a marked variation with angle of attack, suggesting a significant change 
in flow features over the Blended Wing Body configuration as the 
incidence varies. However Blended Wing Body’s stability derivative’s 
value is smaller than Boeing 747-100 [13] by comparing with the value of 
longitudinal stability. Table 5-1 shows Boeing 747-100 static stability 
data.

Recognizing the basic aerodynamics of this study, we compute the 
lateral and directional stability variation at different speed of crosswinds.
