accompanying smaller amounts of silicon and calcium oxides. Because of its low cost, it has been 
widely applied in other process such as hydrodesulfidation, hydrodechlorination reactions and 
cements manufacture [1-3]. Slimane and Abbasian used metal oxide-containing waste materials 
as a desulfurization sorbent. They found that metal oxide waste materials represent viable 
efficiency for the removal of H2S from coal gas in the temperature range of 673-773K [4].  
To the consideration of energy saving and resource reuse, the sorbent with high reactivity 
and low cost will be the important role in the future decades. On the basis of this consideration, 
heavy metal contaminated soils are taking into account for the removal of H2S in this study due to 
its large quantity, easy obtaining and relatively low obtained cost. However, heavy metals in soils 
are divided into several species, including exchangeable, carbonate, Fe-Mn binding, organic form 
and residual form. Which heavy metal binding form is the key point and plays major role to react 
with H2S is the current issue in this study. The main objective of this study is attempting to use 
heavy metal contaminated soil as a sorbent for removal of H2S and combine with the selective 
chemical sequential extraction method to investigate the effect of different binding forms on the 
removal of H2S. 
 
Experiment and materials 
Contaminated soils preparation 
The studied soils were collected from the one of severely contaminated sites recognized by 
the Department of Environment Protection Administration, Taiwan and have been assessed as the 
fifth level according to the Taiwan EPA soil pollution classification (concentration of Zn exceed 
300 ppm). Heavy metal contained water from Erh-Jen River was used to irrigate the farmlands 
and leaded to the soils’ contamination. The Zn-contaminated soils were sampled at a depth of 0 to 
15 cm from a site that is near metallurgical factories around the side of Erh-Jen River in southern 
Taiwan. Unwanted materials such as leaves, tree roots and pebbles were removed from samples 
and then dried at ambient temperature for a week. The collected soils were ground with an agate 
mortar and sieved to pass through a 2-mm sieve.  
Tessier chemical sequential extraction procedure 
One gram of each soil were reacted with 15 mL deionized for 2 h in a polycarbonate 
centrifuge tube at room temperature, and the following fractions were obtained: the water soluble, 
carbonate, Fe-Mn oxides, organic, and residual, using the procedure of Tessier et al. (1979). 
Water Soluble. Soil sample extracted with of deionized water for 2 h. 
Exchangeable. The residue from water soluble fraction is extracted with of 1M MgCl2 (pH= 7.0) 
for 1h. 
Carbonate-Bound. The residue from exchangeable fraction is extracted with 8 mL of 1M NaOAc 
(adjusted to pH 5.0 with HOAc) for 5 h. 
concentration from the reactor approached the inlet concentration of H2S. In this study, the 
breakthrough time was defined as the time from the beginning of the sorption to the point of 
outlet H2S when H2S concentration of outlet H2S concentration reached 100 ppm. Following 
sorption run, the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas for 15 min, and then oxidation was begun 
at 873 K with 1% O2 under the same WHSV, 2000 ml h-1 g-1. The regeneration experiment was 
terminated when the concentration of SO2 in the effluent gas was below 50 ppm.
