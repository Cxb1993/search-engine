CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Driven by technology and user demand, new wireless services and applications are
being deployed much faster than ever. Such growth comes with an increasing demand
for spectral resources, and may soon exhaust the wireless spectrum. To alleviate
this problem, new ways of using the spectrum along with more flexible spectrum
management are needed. In views of such needs, the US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) has adopted new rules that allow unlicensed devices to operate in
the TV bands on a secondary basis, after the cease of analog TV broadcast in June
2009. Many new international standards, such as IEEE 802.22 and IEEE 802.11ad,
have also being developed to improve spectrum utilization.
The idea behind the above regulatory and research efforts is simple: if a spectral
band (i.e., a channel) is not utilized by its licensed devices, other devices should be
allowed to use this band, provided that they do not interfere with the licensed device.
By allowing devices to opportunistically utilize the wireless spectrum, both individual
devices’ performance and overall spectrum utilization can be improved significantly .
This new way of spectrum access, referred to as dynamic spectrum access (DSA), is
a promising technology for future wireless communications and has been realized to
some extent by using some off-the-shelf components .
In order to realize DSA, unlicensed devices in general must (1) discover resources
that are left unused by licensed devices, and (2) share the unused spectrum with
other unlicensed devices without causing noticeable interference to licensed devices.To
achieve the first task, unlicensed devices must sense the wireless spectrum. The main
objective of spectrum sensing is (i) to maximize the opportunity that unlicensed
1
busy tones, a node is able to know all the data transmitting and receiving activities
in its neighborhood. With the busy tone, the hidden and exposed terminal problems
can then be eliminated in wireless networks.
Instead of relying on a fixed channel as the common control channel, the Cognitive
MAC (C-MAC) protocol uses a changeable control channel for resource coordination.
The C-MAC protocol introduced two important concepts: the rendezvous channel
and the backup channel. The rendezvous channel is used to coordinate devices in
different channels for multi-channel resource reservation while the backup channel
allows devices to quickly re-establish communication after the presence of returning
licensed devices. In C-MAC, unlicensed devices send beacons periodically in the
rendezvous channel to coordinate the spectrum access as in other common control
channel schemes.
In the split-phase approach, the time is separated into two phase: control phase
and data phase. In control phase, all devices switch to the control channel and
exchange control messages with each other. In data phase, devices start their data
communication on the acquired channels which are obtained during the control phase.
Compared to the common control channel protocol, each device only needs sin-
gle transceiver in the split-phase protocol. For example, the Multi-channel MAC
(MMAC) has a default control channel and defines the time duration in the periodic
beacon intervals which is called ATIM window. During the ATIM window, the de-
vice which have packet to send negotiates channels with its target device by sending
control messages (i.e., ATIM/ATIM-ACK/ATIM-RES) on the control channel. Af-
ter the ATIM window, communication pairs then switch to their selected channels
and contend for the spectrum by using the traditional RTS/CTS mechanism which
is designed only for a single channel.
The channel-hopping protocols treat the spectrum sharing problem in a different
way. Such protocols require each device to hop among all channels in a device-specific
3
However, if multiple BSs are collocated, the CPEs that belong to different BSs but
reside in the overlapping coverage of the collocated BSs may interfere with each other.
To enable interference-free coexistence among collocated WRANs, BSs and CPEs ex-
change their usage information of the TV channels via CBP. With the help of CBP,
collocated BSs can adjust their usage of available TV channels to avoid interference.
Most of the exiting solutions treat spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing as
a sequential process. This is, devices first scan the spectrum to identify available
resource. Devices then share the identified resources via distributed contention or
centralized allocation (i.e., DSA-enabled MAC). Unlike the existing solutions, we
consider the resource sharing as an integrated component in spectrum scanning. In
our proposal, each unlicensed device acquires the spectral resource that is proportional
to the scanning rate, with the help of a simple spectrum sharing etiquette. Our main
contributions in this paper include
• providing proportional share of total available resources to competing devices
via simple control over the scanning rate, and
• simplifying the design of distributed MAC protocols in DSA via a spectrum
sharing etiquette.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 introduces the system
model and assumptions used throughout the paper. Chapter 3 presents the details
of our proposal and the mathematical models. Numerical analysis and performance
evaluation are presented in Chapter 4 .

uses its own designated channel, the ON/OFF random processes in different channels
are assumed to be independent of each other. The lengths of ON and OFFs periods in
a given channel are also assumed to be independent of each other and follow general
probability density functions (p.d.f) with a mean of Ton and Toff , respectively.
We further assumed that secondary devices only access a channel during the OFF-
periods. Although secondary devices may use a channel during ON-periods without
causing harmful interference to the licensed devices (e.g., by using underlay trans-
mission techniques), we do not allow such co-channel usage, as it is very difficult for
secondary devices to determine whether or not the co-channel interference is accept-
able to the licensed devices. With this assumption, secondary devices must vacate
a channel in a timely fashion once the primary devices return to that channel. For
example, FCC requires a secondary device to vacate a TV band within Td=10 seconds
after the primary devices return to the TV channel. In the IEEE 802.22 standard
draft, the WRAN devices are required to vacate in Td = 2 seconds.

(b) The Sharing etiquette
Figure 1: Two different scanning etiquettes: Winner-Gets-All and Sharing
The requirement of exponentially-distributed scanning interval is essential in our
mechanism. If the intervals are not exponentially distributed (e.g., constant or uni-
formly distributed), Eq. (3.1) cannot be satisfied as we will show later. The require-
ment of exclusive access to an OFF period is referred to as the ”Winner-Gets-All”
spectrum access etiquette. Here, a winner is the secondary device that first discov-
ers an OFF period. The opposite to the Winner-Gets-All etiquette is the ”Sharing”
etiquette where any device can access an OFF period, probably via contention, once
the device discovers the OFF period. To our best knowledge, most of the existing
solutions adopt the Sharing etiquette.
Figure 1 illustrates the two spectrum access etiquettes. Each arrow in the figures
represents a channel scan performed by some device(s). In Figure 1-(a), device 1
is the winner of the OFF period. Under the Winner-Gets-All etiquette, device 1
starts using the channel immediately. Devices 2 and 3 cannot access the channel even
though they detect the same OFF period later. On the contrary, devices 1, 2, and 3
access and share the OFF period under the Sharing etiquette, depending on the time
9
that knowing the value of M is not a requirement for secondary devices to achieve
Eq. (3.1) as we will show later. Table 3.1 lists the symbols used in this section.
3.1.1 Winner-Gets-All Etiquette
According to the proposed mechanism, device k can access channel i only when
the channel enters an OFF period and is detected by device k. Therefore, we can
derive the average access time that device k acquires from an OFF period of channel
i as
T (k)gained,i =

pi,off (t)dt
(3.2)
where p(j)i (t) is the pdf of the interval between two consecutive scans of device j in
channel i, and pi,off (t) is the pdf of an OFF period in that channel. Here, p
(j)
i (t) is
exponentially-distributed with a mean of T (j)i as proposed in our mechanism. Note
that Eq. (3.2) uses the memoryless property of exponentially-distributed random
variables. That is, when channel i enters an OFF period, the remaining time device
k needs to wait until its next scan is still exponentially distributed with a mean of
T (k)i . Eq. (3.2) is derived based on the fact that device k only accesses channel i when
device k’s remaining time to the next scan is less than those of all other devices.
Eq. (3.2) can be further simplified as

To make comparison with the proposed mechanism, the channel access time under
the Sharing etiquette is also derived. We first consider the special case of M = 2. In

3.1.3 Comparison and Evaluation
Figure 3 plots the channel access time of two arbitrary devices based on Eq. (3.3)
and Eq. (3.12). We still consider exponentially-distributed, uniformly-distributed,
and constant ON/OFF periods to evaluate the impact of channel dynamics on T (k)gained,i.
We vary the scanning rates but keep λ(1)i = 2 λ
(2)
i . The figure shows that the value
of T (1)gained,i/T
(2)
gained,i remains constant and is independent of channel dynamics when
devices use the proposed mechanism. When using the Sharing etiquette, the ratio
changes with the devices’ scanning rates. When the scanning rate is low (λ(k)i <<
1
Ti,OFF
), an OFF period is most likely to be discovered by one device only before the
OFF period ends. In this case, the Sharing etiquette works as the Winner-Gets-All
etiquette. When the scanning rate is very high (λ(k)i >>
1
Ti,OFF
), the two devices
discover the same OFF period almost at the same time. Therefore, a significant
portion of the OFF period is shared by the two devices. In this case, the Sharing
etiquette provides equalitarian sharing. In addition to its dependency on λ(k)i , the
value of T (1)gained,i/T
(2)
gained,i also changes with the channel dynamics under the Sharing

Figure 4: The acquired time ratio when devices scan channels with non-exponential
scanning intervals (M=2 and λ(1)i : λ
(2)
i = 2 : 1)
2 does. The higher the scanning rate, the more excessive time device 1 acquires. For
example, T (1)gained,i/T
(2)
gained,i is almost 3 when λ
(k)
i is large in the case of constant scan-
ning intervals. The result suggest that the Winner-Gets-All etiquette alone cannot
provide proportional sharing. In the case of the Sharing etiquette, the result is similar
to that in Figure 3. The value of T (1)gained,i/T
(2)
gained,i not only is different from
λ1
λ2
but
also changes with the channel dynamic. Figure 3 and Figure 4 together demonstrate
that only the proposed mechanism (i.e., the combination of Winner-Gets-All etiquette

The total channel access time decrease slowly when PF ≤ 0.3 but decreases dramati-
cally when PF ≥ 0.7. Another interesting finding is that the imperfect scanning has
different levels of impact on devices using different scanning rates. This observation
matches the results in Figure. 2 where the scanning rate has non-lnear impact on the
total channel access time acquired by the devices.
3.3 T (i)gained with non-zero Tscan
We have shown that regardless of detection accuracy, proportional sharing can be
achieved by the proposed mechanism as long as the devices’ scanning rates are kept
at the required ratios. To further investigate the impact of scanning in a real system,
the scanning overhead (i.e., Tscan $= 0) must also be considered. After all, frequent
scanning means that a large amount of time is spent in detection, instead of data
transmission.
We consider the case where devices operate in a multi-channel environment. The
scans performed by a device in different channels are independent and follow the same
mechanism as described earlier (i.e., λ(k)i = λ
(k)
j for device k). In this case, a winner
of channel i may leave the channel during the OFF period for Tscan seconds in order
to scan channel j. If channel j is also in an OFF period and the winner device of
channel i happens to be the first to discover the OFF period, the device becomes the
winner of channels i and j at the same time. The device can then use both channels
for data transmission if it is supported by the physical layer. Although a device can
scan the channels aggressively to become the winner of multiple channels, doing so
requires the device to frequently vacate the existing OFF periods as well. Overall,
aggressive scanning may not be a good idea to the secondary devices in terms of
“effective” channel access time.
Let x′k be the time interval between the start of an OFF period and the time when
21
an Erlang distribution. We also assume that devices scan the channel at least as
fast the channel changes its state as suggested by Figure 2. Therefore, we have
Ti,off ≥ T
(k)
i >> Tscan.

The ratio, R(k)gained,i, is related to how frequently device k scans other channels. To
find R(k)gained,i, we consider the impact of scanning overheads on a specific channel, say
channel j. We define another ratio, R(k)scan,j, as the average time that device k spends

According to Eq. (3.34), we find that the impact of scanning overheads is related
to the ratio Tscan/T
(k)
j and Tscan/(Tj,on + Tj,off). Usually Tj,on + Tj,off is much larger
than Tscan, which means that the second term in Eq. (3.34) is small enough to be
ignored. The ratio Tscan/T
(k)
j represents the time used for channel sensing on channel
j per unit time. That is, if a device seldom scans the channel, the impact of scanning
overhead is very small. According to Eq. (3.26), the more time is reduced when N
becomes larger. That matches our intuition that if the more channels devices can use,
the more time devices have to spend on performing out-of-band sensing. If a device
can only access one channel for data transmission, the more frequently a device scans
channels, the more chance a device can find an OFF period. Once the device finds
an available channel for using, it stops scanning other channels until primary devices’
signals are detected on this channel. That is, the scanning overhead is ignorable when
devices can access only one channel at one time.
In the above derivations, we make the assumption that the length of scanning
intervals and OFF periods are much larger than Tscan to obtain the approximated
expressions. In order to observe the accuracy of our approximation, we conduct
simulations on MATLAB and find that our mathematical analysis is very close to the
simulation results, as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6 shows that the total channel access time under different channel numbers
when taking scanning overhead into consideration. In Figure 6, there are two com-
peting communication pairs in the network. Ton and Toff are 100 seconds, and Tscan
is set as 10 milliseconds. It shows that if a device seldom scans channels, the impact
of scanning overheads is very small. For example, when the scanning interval is 103

Unlike the acquired time ratio under zero scanning overhead, it decreases slightly as
scanning rates becomes larger due to the impact of scanning overheads. Besides, the
ratio is related to number of channels. The more the channel number, the larger the
scanning overheads appear. It also shows that the pair with higher scanning rates is
influenced from scanning overheads more than the pair with smaller scanning rates.
In conclusion, the impact of scanning overheads is reducing devices’ acquired time.
Scanning overhead is related to number of channels, devices’ scanning rates, and the
length of ON and OFF periods. Scanning the channels that are unavailable for using
as frequently as possible is not a good way to find the optimal resource as each

CHAPTER 4
NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
4.1 Impact of False-Alarm
The detection procedure usually divided into two parts: energy detection and
feature detection. First, a device uses energy detection to determine the received
signal strength. If the signal strength is below a certain threshold, the channel is
considered to be available for data transmission, which is referred to an OFF-period.
However, if the signal strength is above the threshold, the spectral agile device uses
the feature detection to determine the source of the received signal. By using feature
detection, the scanning device can differentiate the primary users’ signals from other
secondary users’ signals. Unfortunately, the detection procedure cannot guarantee
the scanning results to be correct. That is, in some cases a device may regard the
duration with no primary users as an ON-period, which are called false alarm.
In this section, we evaluate the impact of false alarm happened in the scanning
process. The probability that a false alarm event happen is denoted as PF . Base on
our intuition, if the false-alarm probability becomes larger, a device may have more
chance to miss available resource a device can use for data transmission. The proba-
bility is related to the length of sensing time. If devices pay more time for detecting
signals on a channel, the scanning results acquired from the detection procedure are
more accurate, thus reducing the false-alarm probability. However, devices cannot
scan channels and transmit data at the same time. The time devices can used for
data transmission become less if they pay more for channel sensing. Clearly, this

Figure 9: The relationship between channel access time and scanning rate
matches our intuition. The more the false-alarm probability, the less time devices can
have.
Another finding is that the false-alarm probability does not affect the acquired
time ratio of devices in Winner-Gets-All. However, the acquired time in Sharing
decrease from 0.65 to 0.25. Why the acquired time in Sharing etiquette converges to
the ratio of devices’ scanning rates (λ1/λ2 = 0.25) ? We can regard the appearance of
false alarm event as a device failed to scan the channel. For example, if a device has the
false-alarm probability equals to 0.5, only one successful scan a device can averagely
achieve when the device scans twice. That is, the scanning rate of this device with
Pf = 0.5 is considered as half of that of perfect scanning. According to the results in
Fig. 9, when the scanning rate is very low, the acquired time ratio in Sharing converges

acquired time ratio of other distributions would not remain constant as false-alarm
probability increases.
The above result shows that the Winner-Gets-All policy only provides an approxi-
mately proportional share of the spectral resource ratio, while the winner-gets-all with
exponential scanning intervals can provide the perfect control (proportional share)
over the spectral resource.
