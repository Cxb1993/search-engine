Abstract 
Various CeO2/ZrO2 samples were fabricated by sintering, whereby CeO2 
was completely dissolved or reacted with ZrO2 as a solid solution or 
Ce2Ze3O10 and Ce2Ze2O7 ternary compounds.  Sintered samples were 
allowed to react with Ti at 1550°C for 4 h in argon.  Microstructural 
characterization was conducted using x-ray diffraction and analytical 
electron microscopy.  The CeO2/ZrO2 samples became more stable 
with increasing CeO2 because CeO2 was hardly reacted and dissolved in 
Ti.  The incorporation of more than 50 mol% CeO2 could effectively 
suppress the interfacial reactions in the Ti side, where relatively a small 
amount of β'-Ti(Zr, O) was found.  Moreover, the content of O in 
α-Ti(O) far away from the interface was significantly decreasing with 
increasing amounts of CeO2.  Because CeO2 was hardly dissolved into 
Ti, it completely remained in the residual ZrO2, leading to the formation 
of spherical and worm-like Ce2Ze3O10 in the outermost 10 mol% CeO2 
-ZrO2 sample.  In the outermost 30-50 mol% CeO2 -ZrO2 samples, 
Ce2Ze2O7 was formed due to the outward diffusion of O and Zr away 
from Ce2Ze3O10 into Ti.  CeO2 re-precipitated in the samples 
containing 50-70 mol% CeO2, because the solubility of CeO2 in Ti was 
 4 
the role of the ceramic mold in the interfacial reactions has not been 
fully understood to date. 
 
Recently, Lin and his colleagues6-12 have thoroughly investigated the 
phase formation mechanisms and microstructural evolution at the 
interface between titanium (or titanium alloys) and 3Y-ZrO2 (or various 
ratios of Y2O3/ZrO2) using analytical electron microscopy.  The 
α-Ti(O), β'-Ti(Zr, O) and/or Ti2ZrO were formed near the original 
interface due to the dissolution of ZrO2 into Ti.  Both lamellar 
orthorhombic Ti2ZrO and spherical hexagonal Ti2ZrO were found in 
α-Ti(Zr, O) after reaction at 1550oC.8  Lin and Lin9 also found the 
intergranular α-Zr, twinned t'-ZrO2-x, lenticular t-ZrO2-x, and/or ordered 
c-ZrO2-x in the zirconia side far from the interface between Ti and 
3Y-ZrO2 after reaction at 1550oC.  Concerning the reaction of Ti melt 
with various Y2O3/ZrO2 samples at 1700°C,12 the incorporation of more 
than 30 vol% Y2O3 in ZrO2 could effectively suppress the reactions in 
the Ti side where only a very small amount of α-Ti and β'-Ti was found.  
Y2O3 re-precipitated in the samples containing 30-70 vol% Y2O3, 
because the solubility of Y2O3 in Ti was very low. 
 
Several recent publications13-15 have reported the importance of ceramic 
materials based on solid solutions of the ZrO2–CeO2 system, mainly 
those formulated in the ZrO2–rich region.  There are many potential 
applications of these materials, such as a toughened ceramic material in 
view of the existence of a relatively wide field of the tetragonal zirconia 
solid solution in the system ZrO2–CeO2.  It is well known that 
ceria-doped zirconia polycrystals (Ce-TZP) exhibit high transformation 
toughness, even when compared to Y-TZP ceramics.13-17  However, 
CeO2 was cheaper than Y2O3.  The ceria partially stabilized zirconia 
 6 
an agate mortar and pestle, and then screened through 80 mesh.  The 
powder mixtures of CeO2 and ZrO2 were pressed into disks (20 mm in 
diameter x 5 mm thick) at a pressure of 200MPa and then sintered in air 
at 1400°C for 4 h at 5°C/min heating rate (Lindberg/Blue M 
STF54454C, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham Massachusetts, 
USA).  Thereafter, the furnace cooled down to room temperature. 
 
The apparent densities of CeO2/ZrO2 powder mixtures were measured 
using a gas pycnometer (Model MultiVolume Pycnometer 1305, 
Micromeritics, Norcross, GA) with 99.99% pure helium.  The bulk 
densities of sintered samples were determined using the Archimedes 
method.  The relative densities of the sintered samples were calculated 
as follows: Relative density = (bulk density/true density) × 100%.  For 
a non-porous powder, the apparent density approximates the true density 
and can be used as the reference point in calculating the relative density.  
The designations, compositions, sintering conditions, and relative 
densities of CeO2/ZrO2 samples are listed in Table I. 
 
Commercially pure titanium plates (99.7% purity, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, 
MA) were brought to react with various sintered CeO2/ZrO2 samples at 
1550°C for 4 h in argon.  Firstly, bulk CeO2/ZrO2 samples and titanium 
plates were cut and machined to dimensions of 10 × 10 × 4 mm.  Their 
surfaces were ground and polished with a diamond paste, and then 
ultrasonically cleaned in acetone.  One titanium disc was inserted in 
between two pieces of each CeO2/ZrO2 sample to produce a sandwiched 
type, and then put in the graphite furnace mentioned above, which was 
preparatorily pressed under 5 MPa, evacuated to 2 x 10-4 Torr, and filled 
with argon to one atmospheric pressure.  This cycle of evacuation and 
purging was repeated at least three times.  The temperature was raised 
 8 
operating parameters were adjusted so that the electron beam was 5 kV 
from 98 pA to 1.6 nA and the ion beam was 30 kV from 10 pA to 7 nA.  
A TEM specimen with a thickness less than 100 nm was 
electron-transparent.  The final TEM specimen was approximately 12 x 
5 x 0.05 µm in size.   
 
The interfacial microstructures were then characterized using a 
transmission electron microscope (TEM, Model JEM 2100, JEOL Ltd., 
Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer 
(EDS, Model ISIS 300, Oxford Instrument Inc., London, UK).  
Analyses of atomic configurations in various phases were performed 
using computer simulation software for crystallography (CaRIne 
Crystallography 3.1, Divergent S.A., France).  Chemical quantitative 
analyses for various phases were conducted by the Cliff-Lorimer 
standardless technique.18  A conventional ZAF correction was operated 
using the LINK ISIS software. 
 
III. Results and Discussion 
(1) XRD analyses 
Figure 1 shows the x-ray diffraction spectra of various CeO2/ZrO2 
samples as well as pure CeO2 after sintering.  These spectra were 
arranged for CeO2, 70Ce30Zr, 50Ce50Zr, 30Ce70Zr, and 10Ce90Zr, 
respectively, in a sequence from top to bottom.  X-ray phases of these 
sintered CeO2/ZrO2 samples are summarized in Table I.  In the 
10Ce90Zr, all of the CeO2 went into solid solution in zirconia such that 
only t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 were detected.  Both of the 30Ce70Zr and 
50Ce50Zr, c-ZrO2, t-ZrO2, tetragonal Ce2Zr3O10,19-21 and cubic 
Ce2Ze2O722,23 were found.  As for the 70Ce30Zr, Ce2Ze2O7 and only 
cubic ZrO2 phase were detected.  In other words, the cubic ZrO2 was

(2) Microstructures of Ti and various sintered CeO2/ZrO2 samples 
Figures 2(a)-(e) display the backscattered electron images of the 
cross-sections normal to the interfaces of Ti and various CeO2/ZrO2 
samples after reaction at 1550°C for 4 h.  Titanium is shown to the left 
of the micrograph, while zirconia is on the right-hand side.  The 
vertical arrows in the upper side of individual figures indicate the 
original interfaces of Ti and individual CeO2/ZrO2 samples, respectively.  
The original interfaces were deliberately located according to the 
characteristic Kα x-ray maps of cerium (not shown), which was 
relatively immobile compared with respect to Zr, O, and Ti, etc.  To the 
left of the reaction layer “I” was the α-Ti with oxygen in solid solution.  
Based on EDS results, the content of oxygen in α-Ti(O) was apparently 
decreasing with increasing amount of CeO2.  The composition of 
α-Ti(O) in 10Ce90Zr was measured as 70.47 at% Ti and 29.53 at% O.  
An α-Ti(O) in 70Ce30Zr was consisted of 85.72 at% Ti and 14.28 at% 
O.   
 
Figure 2(a) and (b) indicated that extensive reactions took place at the 
interface between Ti and ZrO2 containing 10 mol% and 30 mol% CeO2.  
It was previously reported that needle-like α-Ti and some lamellar 
phases were usually found in the titanium side because of the interfacial 
reactions between Ti and ZrO2.7,8,10,11  However, only a limited reaction 
took place on the titanium side at the interface between Ti and those 
samples containing more than 50 mol% CeO2, while pure CeO2 reacted 
minimally with Ti after reaction at 1550°C for 4 h.  This indicated that 
interfacial reactions were effectively suppressed in those samples 
containing more than 50 mol% CeO2.  This fact plays an important role 
in the engineering respect of Ti castings such that a controlled interfacial 
reaction results in a lower amount of α-casing and thus better 
 12
dissolved a relatively small amount of zirconium due to much slower 
diffusion rate of zirconium than oxygen, thus no Ti2ZrO precipitated in 
α-Ti during cooling. 
 
(B) Reaction layer “III” on the ceramic side at the Ti/10Ce90Zr and 
Ti/30Ce70Zr interfaces 
For the benefit of good resolution of TEM, figure 4(a) shows the TEM 
micrograph (bright-field image, BFI) of reaction layer “III”.  The 
reaction layer “III” was consisting of α-Ti, β'-Ti, and Ce2Zr3O10 at the 
Ti/10Ce90Zr interface after reaction at 1550°C for 4 h.  Arrow below 
the BFI indicates the original interface between reaction layers “II” and 
“III”.  A large amount of spherical or worm-like Ce2Zr3O10 phase 
existed in the reaction layer “III”.  Fig. 4(a) also shows Ti2ZrO 
lamellae precipitated in the α-Ti matrix.  With the diffraction spots 
being indexed in Fig. 4(b), the orientation relationships of Ti2ZrO and 
α-Ti were thus recognized as follows: [110]Ti2ZrO // [0001]α-Ti and 
(1 1 0)Ti2ZrO // (10 1 0)α-Ti.  The crystal structures of Ti2ZrO and α-Ti 
were identified to be orthorhombic and hexagonal based upon the 
superimposed selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs), as shown in 
fig. 4(b).  Figure 4(c) shows the SADP of Ce2Zr3O10 phase along the 
zone axis of [001].  The crystal structure of Ce2Zr3O10 was identified to 
be tetragonal from the SADP.   
 
Figure 5(a) shows the BEI of the reaction layer “III” at the Ti/10Ce90Zr 
interface after reaction at 1550°C for 4 h.  As 10Ce90Zr reacted with 
Ti at 1550°C for 4 h, an increasing amount of O and Zr from the 
supersaturated 10 mol% CeO2-ZrO2 solid solution were gradually 
dissolved in titanium.  Because CeO2 remained in the solid solution 
due to the very limited solubility of CeO2 in Ti, the increase in the ratio 
 14
(space group Fd3m) in which one out of every eight oxygen ions is 
missing in the stoichiometric fluorite.  The ideal Ce2Zr2O7 structure is 
described as an ordered cubic close-packed array of cations (16c and 
16d sites) with the oxygen ions occupying seven-eighths of the 
tetrahedral sites (48f and 8a sites) between the cations.  The oxygen 
vacancies in the remaining one-eighths of the tetrahedral sites (8b site) 
are also ordered. 
 
(C) Reaction layers “I” and “III” at the Ti/50Ce50Zr and Ti/70Ce30Zr 
interfaces 
Figure 7(a) displays the BEI of reaction layers “I” and “III” at the 
Ti/50Ce50Zr interface after reaction at 1550°C for 4 h.  Reaction layer 
“I” in 50Ce50Zr consisted of α-Ti, β'-Ti, and CeO2.  For comparison, 
as shown in Fig. 7(a) together with Fig. 2, only very few β'-Ti was found 
in the reaction layer “I”.  However, a relatively large amount of β'-Ti 
and α-Ti existed at the interface between Ti and ZrO2 containing 10-30 
mol% CeO2.  The reaction layer “III” in 50Ce50Zr consisted of α-Ti, 
β'-Ti, CeO2, and Ce2Zr2O7.  As 50Ce50Zr reacted with Ti, a large 
amount of O and Zr from ZrO2 were dissolved in titanium, giving rise to 
the formation of CeO2 due to the very limited solubility of CeO2 in Ti.  
From the EDS analyses, the CeO2 in the reaction layer “III” contained 
32.14 at% Ce, 64.57 at% O, and 3.29 at% Zr.  The re-precipitation of 
CeO2 in reaction layer “III” was dense and interconnected.  It was 
concluded that increasing CeO2 content was useful for better controlling 
the interfacial reactions.  The formation mechanisms of α-Ti, β'-Ti, 
CeO2, and Ce2Zr2O7 in the case of Ti/50Ce50Zr in the reaction layer 
“III” can be expressed as follows: 
 
0.5 CeO2 + 0.5 ZrO2 →(Ce0.5Zr0.5)O2              durng sintering (4) 
 16
and 70Ce30Zr, respectively, after reaction at 1550°C for 4 h.  Figure 8(a) 
shows the α-Zr particle was embedded in c-ZrO2-x in reaction layer “IV” 
of 10Ce90Zr.  It was believed that the oxidation-reduction reaction 
rather than dissolution was the predominant reaction mechanism in 
reaction layer “IV”.  The dissolution did not play a significant role, as 
the titanium was not detected by EDS in reaction layer “IV”.  It was 
obivous that the ZrO2-x was metastable because of the extraction of 
oxygen from ZrO2 by Ti.  The α-Zr with oxygen in solid solution was 
excluded from metastable ZrO2-x.  However a significant increase in 
oxygen vacancies, as a consequence of the reaction between Ti and 
30Ce70Zr, triggered the stabilization effect of zirconia.  Therefore, it 
was inferred that the zirconia could be in the cubic phase.  Figure 8(b) 
shows several Ce2Zr2O7 grains were existed along the grain boundaries of 
c-ZrO2-x in reaction layer “IV” of 30Ce70Zr.  No α-Zr was found in the 
reaction layer “IV” of 30Ce70Zr.  Cubic Ce2Zr2O7 was formed due to 
the decomposition of the Ce2Zr3O10.  Since CeO2 was completely 
retained in ZrO2, no free CeO2 was found in 10Ce90Zr and 30Ce70Zr. 
 
Figure 8(c) shows the BFI of Ce2Zr2O7 and dense α-Zr grain in the 
reaction layer “IV” of Ti/50Ce50Zr.  The morphology of α-Zr in the 
reaction layer “IV” of Ti/50Ce50Zr was very different from 10Ce90Zr.   
Formation mechanisms of Ce2Zr2O7 and α-Zr in the case of Ti/50Ce50Zr 
in the reaction layer “IV” can be expressed in terms of the following 
equation: 
 
Ce2Zr3O10 ℃? Ce2Zr2O7 + α-Zr (with O in solid solution) + 3O (pariially dissolved in β'-Ti)
 (9)  
 
Figure 8(d) shows the BFI of reaction layer “IV” in 70Ce30Zr after 
 18
with low oxygen partial pressure and Ce2O3 reacted with ZrO2 as a 1:2 
Ce2O3 •ZrO2 ternary compound (or Ce2Zr2O7). As 50Ce50Zr and 
70Ce30Zr were reacted with Ti at 1550ºC for 4 h, CeO2 was 
re-precipitated due to the strong affinity of O and Zr to Ti and the very 
limited solubility of CeO2.  CeO was found in the sample containing 
100 mol% CeO2 due to the oxidation-reduction between Ti and CeO2.  
It was also noted that Ce2Ze2O7 was stable and retained in the sample 
after reaction at 1550ºC for 4 h. 
 
 
 
 
IV. Conclusions 
1. The incorporation of more than 50 mol% CeO2 significantly 
suppressed the interfacial reactions at the interfaces between Ti and 
various sintered CeO2/ZrO2 samples. 
2. On the metal side near the original interface, a relatively large 
amount of β'-Ti and α-Ti were observed after Ti reacted with 
10Ce90Zr or 30Ce70Zr at 1550ºC for 4 h.  However, few β'-Ti was 
found after Ti reacted with 50Ce50Zr.  No β'-Ti was found after Ti 
reacted with 70Ce30Zr or CeO2 at 1550ºC for 4 h.   
3. After reaction at 1550ºC for 4 h, β'-Ti, α-Ti and Ce2Zr3O10 were 
found in the outermost region of 10Ce90Zr, while β'-Ti and Ce2Zr2O7 
existed in the outermost region of 30Ce70Zr.  The formation of 
Ce2Zr3O10 was caused by the extensive dissolution of ZrO2 in Ti 
together with a very limited solubility of CeO2.  The formation of 
Ce2Zr2O7 was caused by the outward diffusion of O and Zr from 
Ce2Zr3O10 in Ti. 
4. The CeO2 was re-precipitated in the outermost region of 50Ce50Zr

報告內容應包括下列各項： 
一、參加會議經過 
學生於 2010 年 10 月 17 日至 21 日出席第 112 屆美國陶瓷協會（ACerS 112th Annual Meeting）在美
國德州休士頓舉行的會議。此系列會議的歷史已有百年之久；同時這也是第 10 年美國陶瓷協會和
AIST (Association for iron & Steel Technology), ASM (ASM International),以及 TMS (The Minerals, 
Metals & Materials Society)共同舉辦之聯合性會議，簡稱 MS&T’10 (Materials Science & Technology 
2010 Conference & Exhibition)。另外今年又加入另一個新的協辦單位- NACE International (The 
Corrosion Society) ，更為這個大型國際盛會注入了新的元素，此聯合性會議在已有豐富舉辦經驗
的美陶協會主辦下，在相關金屬陶瓷領域中，更具有舉足輕重的地位，迄今已經即將邁入第 11 個
年頭。 
    本次會議係由美國舉辦，於德州休士頓市中心之喬治布朗會議中心 ( George R. Brown 
Convention Center)舉行。此會議為期五天，除了首天的開幕儀式及歡迎會外，爾後幾天大會在各
個sessions皆同步舉辦幾十場各種領域的相關研究之會議口頭報告與226篇投稿海報展示，並有幾個
mini-symposium，另外在會議期間每天由該次主/協辦單位相關學者舉行1~3場不等相關議題之演
講，其中包括3場供全員參與的專題演講 (Plenary Session)；針對這次會議的核心議題-energy 
infrastructure, policy and security related to materials science and technology 進行一
連串的介紹和交流；並且以這個核心為主軸，劃分成十項材料應用方向為主題，包括生醫科技、奈
米科技、陶瓷與玻璃材料、鋼鐵材料、電子磁性材料、腐蝕控制工程、產品製程及環境與能源相關
等議題，此次與會人員來自超過72個國家，人數超過千人，除了亞太地區(中、日、台、韓)的學者
專家外，亦有遠從歐、澳、印度與世界各地的相關人士前來參與，另外也有數十家相關的廠商參與，
提供目前最新最頂尖的分析儀器介紹和分析技術的突破與發展等相關資訊，可說是材料領域中級別
極高、規模最盛大的研討會之一。 
    會議中除了論文發表外，主會場內貼心地提供精緻的茶點，以及咖啡與酒精類飲料供與會者享
用。除此之外，還有提供和材料製程相關的教育訓練，科技圖書攤位上一些新書的發表、免費的期
刊可供自由索取等，場面相當熱絡。各界與會人士藉此場合，互相交流彼此的研究或工作狀況，相
談甚歡，真讓人感受到材料領域的蓬勃發展與多樣性。 
 
二、與會心得 
首先，本人此次能順利參加美陶主辦的研討會，要感謝國科會的計畫補助。這是自己第一次參加國
益。一方面希望能有更多的經費補助預算，來補助支持國內大專院校，承辦一些大型國際會議，使
無法獲得出國補助的學生及國內年輕老師，有參與見習國際研討會的機會，另一方面也能鼓勵國內
學生及一些相關研究人員參與國際研討會。進而得到和國際知名學者交換心得與想法的機會，從中
開拓個人視野、人脈建立、培養國際觀等。 
 
五、攜回資料名稱及內容 
(1) 第10屆MS&T年會議程：研討會每日發表論文之場次、時間、發表人、主持人與協辦單位。 
(2) 發表論文摘要VCD光碟片。 
(3) 研討會紀念滑鼠墊一份。 
(4) 相關儀器廠商最新簡介資料。 
(5) 金相顯微科技、材料製程及破壞分析技術相關等免費書籍。
