set corresponding to the j-th premise variable, ia  is the 
i-th system parameter, )(tδ  is a time-varying term, 
usually written in a Fourier sine series expansion form 
with finite length, and ib denotes the i-th control input 
parameter. Note that, in the representation, iv  is the i-th 
bias which is the so-called “affine term” in the T-S fuzzy 
model, and L is the number of the IF-THEN rules. 
The nonlinear and time-varying plant is then 
represented as fuzzy blending of the rules:

D. The Optimization Strategy for System Identification 
and Initialization of Fuzzy PID Controller 
According to last section, there is a strong demand 
for an efficient optimization method, IROA, in the 
proposed system identification, stable fuzzy tracking 
control design procedure and self-tuning gains design 
strategy of nonlinear systems. It is a global search 
technique based on the principles of RO and the simplex 
method. In the optimization problem, a candidate 
solution is defined as a set of parameter matrices, i.e., 
mmmiiijiji vbac 321 ,,,,,,, αααω  in (3); )(ρjK  in (23), to 
be optimized:

)](),...,([ 12 ρρϑ LKK= ,            (36) 
where θϑϑϑ ∈21211 ,,  is usually in expanded cascade 
form of the parameters. Then, we assume 1×∈ nRθ , to be 
optimized as optθ , which is usually in expanded cascade 
form of the parameters 11ϑ  or 12ϑ  or 2ϑ . 
Furthermore, each code has a cost value found by 
evaluating a problem-dependent cost function )(θh , 
θθθθθθθ ∈},,,,,{ kERBLH , )1(,...,2,1 += nk . The 
optimization problem is then defined as searching for θ , 
UL θθθ ≤≤ , to minimize the cost value. First, we 
defined an function, )(],[ θθθ Simp== , see the Simplex 
algorithm [19] that returns a vertex optimal solution θ  
and cost value θ= . Next, we described an improved 
version of the original random search algorithm as 
follows. 
1) Set start point θ , initial bias b, real ]1,1[1 −=γ , real 
]1,0[2 =γ , UJumpJump <= 1 , and random vector 
θγθ ⋅= 1d . 
2) If θθθ == >++ db , set 1=Jump , the current simplex 
solution θ  equal to θθ db ++  and the bias b  
equal to θdb 4.02.0 + ; θγθ ⋅= 1d  and go to step 5. 
Otherwise, go to the next step. 
3) If θθθ == >−+ db , set 1=Jump  the current simplex 
solution θ  equal to θθ db −+  and the bias b  
equal to θdb 4.0− ; θγθ ⋅= 1d  and go to step 5. 
Otherwise, go to the next step. 
4) If optθθ = , stop. Otherwise, set the current bias b 
equal to b5.0 ; 1+= JumpJump , current θd  equal 
to 
Jump
θγ ⋅1  and go to step 5. 
5) If UJumpJump < , go to step 2. Otherwise, the 
current θ  equal to )(2 LUL θθγθ −⋅+  and go to 
step 1. 
The goal is to minimize the integration of absolute of 
modeling error, ∫ ft dte0 mod . Hence, the fitness function is 
defined as follows: 
∫≡ ftID dteFitness 0 mod  for 11ϑ or 12ϑ ,    (37a) 
For the same reason, we design the fitness function is 
defined as follows: 
mintFitnessThm ≡ ,                  (37b) 
where

ρλ σσ  and 
ρ  is constant, and (37b) for 2ϑ . The optimization 
problem is then defined as searching for θ  to minimize 
the fitness value. 
 
E. The Adaptation Law for the Fuzzy PID Controller 
The derivation of the adaptive control law begins 
with assuming the existence of an optimal parameter 
vector, *θ , for the (ideal) fuzzy PID control law:

such that the absolute of the approximation error,

is minimized. Next, let us consider a Lyapunov function 
candidate, θV , which contains the quantities of tracking 
error and the deviation between *θ  and θ :

=5b 30, =6b 30. 
From Fig. 6-7, comparing Case 1 and Case 5, it is clear 
that our method (Case 1) is very efficient. Next, three 
kinds of adaptive controllers are designed for Case 2 ~ 
Case 4 according to the same fuzzy model of (4), 
respectively. 
For the following studies of Case 1 ~ Case 4, we chose 
the state vector constraint, defined in (15), as 35.0=xM , 
the parameter vector constraint, defined in (42), as 
5000=θM , and the upper bounds of mode  used in (6), 
as 12=Ue  (see Fig. 7).

P  to construct the 
supervisory controller, Su  according to (19). 
The time histories of the fuzzy PID gains of Case 1 
under adaptations are depicted in Fig. 8. 
Fig. 9 shows the tracking error trajectories of the 
control system when the adaptive control laws of Case 
1~ Case 4, and the supervisory controller of Case 1, 
based on (19) and (20), is applied. Fig. 10 shows the time 
histories of the adaptive control gains (Case 2~4) under 
adaptation. 
From Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, it is clear that the tracking 
performance of the proposed adaptive controller 
significantly outperform that of an assigned initial gain 
of Case 2~ Case 4 in facing the disturbance, uncertainty 
and modeling error. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
This study attempt unifying the IROA, the T-S fuzzy 
identification model, and the H∞ adaptive fuzzy control 
theory, and we propose a set of integrity adaptive fuzzy 
PID controllers design criteria. First, we establish the 
T-S fuzzy identification model to the unknown nonlinear 
system. But, it has the modeling error and external 
disturbance problems between the T-S fuzzy 
identification model and the real system. And, the 
oversized approximate error and external disturbance 
will destroy the system stability and the control 
performance, then, we again solve this problem by using 
fuzzy Lyapunov function, the adaptive fuzzy PID control 
and the regulation performance parameter at this time, to 
reduce the output signal difference among the model, the 
practical system, and the external disturbance influence. 
Hence, we can design the robust adaptive fuzzy PID 
controller to stabilize the real system by UUB behavioral 
mechanism. Finally, numerical studies of the tracking 
control of an uncertain car-pole system demonstrate that 
the proposed control strategy results in a superior 
tracking performance in the face of plant uncertainties 
and disturbances. Furthermore, as the parameters of the 
fuzzy model allow off-line identification in the scheme, 
the initial tracking performance is ensured.
