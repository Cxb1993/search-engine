6Chapter 1 Introduction
The carbons have many kinds of structure like amorphous carbon film (a-C), diamond
and polymer species. Until 1985, the chemical element carbon was not known to exist in
C60 structure [1]. This changed when Kroto and co-workers discovered an entirely new form
of carbon, which became known as C60 or the fullerene molecule. The original discovery of
C60 was in the soot produced from the laser vaporization of graphite. Since then, other
methods of production have been developed. It is also thought that isolated C60 molecules
may be found in stars and interstellar media. A fullerene molecule consists of 60 carbon
atoms arranged in pentagons and hexagons, very like a standard football (soccer ball). CNTs
are fullerene-related structures, which consist of graphite cylinders, closed at either end with
caps containing pentagonal rings. They were discovered in 1991 by the Japanese electron
microscopist Sumio Iijima [1] who was studying the material deposited on the cathode
during the arc-evaporation synthesis of fullerene [Fig. 1-1]. He found that the central core of
the cathode deposit contained a variety of closed graphitic structures including nanoparticles
and nanotubes, of a type that had never previously been observed. A short time later,
Thomas Ebbesen [2,3], showed how nanotubes could be produced in bulk quantities by
varying the arc-evaporation conditions. This paved the way to an explosion of research into
the physical and chemical properties of carbon nanotubes in laboratories all over the world.
A major event in the development of carbon nanotubes was the synthesis in 1993 of
single-layer nanotubes. The standard arc-evaporation method produces only multi-layered
tubes. It was found that addition of metals such as cobalt to the graphite electrodes resulted
in extremely fine tube with single-layer walls. The CNTs also can be grown from the
catalytic decomposition of certain hydrocarbons over small metal particles such as iron,
cobalt, nickel and some of their alloys. The diameter of the CNTs is controlled by the size of
the catalyst particle and can vary between 2 to 100 nm, and lengths ranging from 5 to 100
µm [4]. The availability of these structures should enable experimentalists to test some of the
theoretical predictions, which have been made about nanotube properties. For example, the
armchair structure makes carbon nanotube behavior like metallic and the zigzag structure
behavior like semiconductor.
The unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much recent attention
[5-8], such as high aspect ratio, high mechanical strength, and high electrical and thermal
conductivity. Therefore, CNTs have been expected to be an excellent reinforcement for
polymeric composites [9, 10]. Several years ago, CNTs were used as additives to reinforce
the strength of composite materials, such as epoxy [11], petroleum pitch [12], PMMA [13],
and aluminum composites [14]. These composites were prepared by direct mixing. But many
studies have shown that the major problems in using CNTs as reinforcement additives are
dispersion of CNTs in composite materials and poor interactions between CNTs and the
matrix. Hence, how to avoid CNTs aggregation and to improve the CNT-matrix interactions
8tube is much closer to the zig-zag tube, which he found in carbon-arc chamber. The zig-zag
tube have lot of dangling bonds. For a tube nucleated from a metal particle, have
high-chemisorbed energy. The high chemisorbed energy can have more dangling bonds just
like zig-zag tube.
1-1-2 Laser vaporization method
A new method for synthesize single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) in which carbon are
vaporized by a laser impinging on a metal-graphite composite target [18] in figure 1-4. The
laser vaporization can control over growth conditions and permits continuous operation. That
produces nanotubes in higher yield (70-90 %) and better quality. Their SWNTs are all about
1 nm in diameter and are arranged in bundles (called ropes), with similar spacing between
adjacent nanotubes. No a-C coating of the tubes was observed. The oven laser vaporization
apparatus used to produce fullerene, metal - fullerene, and multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs).
A scanning laser beam was focused to a 6-7 mm diameter spot onto a metal-graphite
composite target. The laser beam scans across the target surface under computer control to
maintain a smooth, uniform face for vaporization. The target was supported by graphite
poles in a 1- inch quartz tube evacuated to 10 m Torr and then filled with 500 Torr argon
flowing at 50 sccm. The flow tube was mounted in a high temperature furnace, with a
maximum temperature of 1200 . The soot produced b℃ y the laser vaporization was swept
by the flowing argon gas from the high temperature zone, and deposited onto a water-copper
collector positioned downstream, just outside the furnace. The product have higher sharp
peak at 1592 cm-1 than graphite-metal and fullerene material [19]. When the CNTs under
good annealing conditions, a particular tube (10,10) may dominant [20]. The mechanism
requires that metal and carbon vapor be atomized and homogeneous that L-V can have the
properties on a composite carbon/ metal target. In armchair edge, all dangling bonds are
participating in triple bonds.
1-1-3 Chemical vapor deposition methods
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods have been successful in making carbon
fiber filament and nanotubes materials since more than 10-20 years ago.[21-23]
A schematic experimental setup for CVD growth is depicted in figure 1-5. The growth
process involves heating a catalyst material to high temperatures in tube furnace and flowing
a hydrocarbon gas through the tube reactor for a period of time. Materials grown over the
catalyst are collected upon cooling the system to room temperature. The key parameters in
nanotubes CVD growth are the hydrocarbons, catalysts and growth temperature. The active
catalytic species are typically transition-metal nanoparticles formed on a support material
such as alumina. The general nanotubes growth mechanism(figure 1-6) in a CVD process
involves the dissociation of hydrocarbon molecules catalyzed by the transition metal, and
dissolution and saturation of carbon atoms in the metal nanoparticles. The precipitation of
carbon from the saturated metal particle leads to the formation of tubular carbon solids in sp2

to storage the hydrogen as 8 wt%, can be stored under ambient pressure and at 300℃, as
shown in Fig.1-9 b). The storage property is also call nanohorn property; which is developed
by NEC Corporation [33]. They have developed a tiny fuel cell for mobile terminals using
the much anticipated carbon technology raw material - carbon nanotubes - as electrodes,
confirming the fuel cell characteristic is much improved compared with conventional type,
which uses activated carbon.
1-2-3 Electron transistor
Molecular electronics has attracted much interest, particularly because it could lead to
conceptually new miniaturization strategies in the electronics and computer industry.
Electronically, nanotubes are expected to behave as ideal onedimensional (1D) “quantum 
wires” with either semi conducting or metalicbehaviors, depending on geometrical tube
parameters [34]. The realization of single molecule devices has remained challenging,
largely owing to difficulties in achieving electrical contact to individual molecules. They’re 
many efforts have been down as below: Tans report [35] the fabrication of a field-effect
transistor—a three terminal switching device—that consists of one semi conducting
single-wall carbon nanotube connected to two metal electrodes. Collins used [36] scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) to explore the local electrical characteristics of single-wall
carbon nanotubes. As the STM tip was moved along the length of the nanotubes, well
defined positions were found where the transport current changes abruptly from a
graphitic-like response to one that is highly nonlinear and asymmetrical, including
near-perfect rectification. The observations are consistent with the existence of localized,
on-tube nanodevices of a type proposed theoretically. Fig. 1-10 show CNTs can be
fabricated as nanotube wire networks; which single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are
dissolving in ortho-dichlorobenzene and CHCl3. The solution undergoes ultrasonic vibration
and then using electroplating to deposit on silicon.
1-2-4 Composite materials
The mechanical properties of CNTs are expected to approach that of an ideal carbon
fiber, which has the perfect orientation of defect-free grapheme layers along the fiber axis. A
variety of outstanding experimental results on the elucidation of the elastic properties of
CNTs are fast appearing. In literature, it is known that CNTs are elastic and stiff [37-41].
Theoretical predictions on single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) suggest that the Young’s
modulus should be close to the in plane elastic modulus of graphite (~1060 GPa) and the
value of tensile would be ~200 GPa [42, 43]. For MWNTs, the strength will be limited by
the ease with which individual grapheme cylinder slide with respect to each other [44,45].
Experiment measurements on individual MWNTs suggest values for Young’s modulus
around 1000 GPa [40], which is about six fold of that of stainless steel of the same size.
Therefore, it is generally expected that CNTs can be used as structural reinforcement.
1-3 Functionalization of carbon nanotube
12
approach is still the most efficient, reported functionalization of CNT. An easy, rapid,
non-oxidative and strong functionalization approach for the preparation of modified CNTs is
required.
1-3-3 Analytical characterization of functionalized CNTs
In general, experimentally proving that covalent bonds are formed at derivatization are
formed at the suface of a carbon framework of tubes is difficult. However, the solubilization
of CNTs provides opporunities for the spectroscopic characterization of these unique
structures. UV/vis-NIR absorption spectra of functionalized CNTs include a broad ban
around 250 nm, whose intensity declines closer to the near-infrared region. The spectra are
basically featureless, suggesting that some of the electronic characteristics may have been
lost because of extensive surface functionalization. However, linear scatteing from large
functionalized CNTs could lead to a loss of resolution, which issue applies to the SWCNTs,
but not to MWCNTs. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a very important
tool for the structural analysis organic and inorganic substances. However, proton signals
appear to be broad as a result of the statistical distribution of the addends on the CNT surface.
Furthermore, interactions between the protons of the addends and theπsystem of the CNTs,
as well as the restriction of mobility of CNTs associated with their large size, contribute to
line-broadened signals. Raman spectroscopy is an extremely useful tool for characterization
of CNTs. Pristine CNTs exhibit two main characteristic absorptions. They are the
diameter-dependent radial breathing mode (RBM) below 350 cm-1 and the higher-frequency
tangential mode at 1550-1600 cm-1. Moreover, functionalized CNTs may exhibit an increase
in the so-called disorder mode at 1250-1450 cm-1, but its relative intensity may depend on
the laser excitation frequency. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) provides information on
the amount of surface functional groups of functionalized CNTs because the covalent
attachments can be thermally eliminated. Additionally, microscopic techniques such as TEM,
SEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) offer much information regarding the presence of
CNTs in solution. Therefore, CNT samples can be monitored qualitatively, and informant
about dimensions, purity and aggregation can be obtained. High-resolution instrumentation
is required to observe species that are attached to the surface of CNTs.

Chapter 2 Experimental
2-1 CNTs preparation
MWNTs were synthesized by thermal chemical vapor deposition of C2H2 with
ferrocene at 750℃ or 950℃ in a quartz tube furnace as shown in Figure 1. The
experiment conditions of the MWNTs production was listed in Table 1. In a typical
experimental procedure, ferrocene was initially put into the quartz tube furnace, followed by
purging with H2 and N2 gas for one hour. The furnace was then heated up to 250℃ and
held for 15 minutes, followed by heating up to 750℃ or 950℃ at which C2H2 gas was fed
into the furnace for one hour of pyrolytic reaction and deposition. The deposited carbon on
both the quartz tube wall and flat quartz plate inside was investigated by TEM (Jeol
JEM-2010 at 200 kv) and FESEM (Jeol JSM-6700F) and was proved to be MWNTs in
Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Part Ⅰ Ⅰ-1 Carboxylation of CNTs
In a typical experiment, a 100 mg of raw CNTs was added to a 400 ml of a mixture of
sulfuric acid and nitric acid in a composition of 3/2 by volume. The mixture was sonicated
in a bath for 10 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was then heated at 80 oC for 1, 2,
or 3 hours, at 60 oC for 3 hours, or at 25 oC for 6, 12, or 24 hours. At the end of reaction,
the mixture was diluted with deionized water, folowed by filtering through a 0.2 μm 
pore-sized membrane. The product on the membrane was washed with deionized water and
dried in a vacuum oven at 70 oC for 1 day. The structure of the acid-treated CNTs was
examined by TEM (Jeol JEM-2010 at 200 kV) and FESEM (Jeol JSM-6700F). The
thermal stability of the acid-treated CNTs was examined by thermal gravimetric analyzer
(TGA, TA Instruments, TGA 2050). The formation of the COOH groups on CNTs was
verified by Fourier transform infared spectrophotometer (FTIR, Perkin Elmer, Spectrum One)
and the concentrations of the COOH groups were quantitatively evaluated by titrations as
follows.
Ⅰ-2 Quantitative evaluation of the COOH groups
The carboxylated CNTs were quantitatively analyzed by titration to determine the
COOH concentrations on the surface of the acid-treated CNTs. In a typical experiment, the
carboxylated CNTs were added into a 50-ml 0.01-N NaOH solution and stirred overnight.
The mixture was titrated with a 0.01-N HCl solution to determine the excess NaOH in the
solution to determine the concentration of the COOH on CNTs.
Ⅰ-3 Solubility measurement of the acid-treated CNTs
A 0.2 mg of the as-synthesized CNTs or the acid-treated CNTs was added to a 4 ml of
acetone (or methanol or ethanol) or water of various pH values in a vial followed by
sonication for 5 min. Water of various pH values was adjusted by adding HCl or NaOH.
Following the sonication, every solution was left still for various times to investigate the
26
deposition at 750oC using acetylene as a carbon source and ferrocene as a catalyst in our lab.
The obtained MWNTs were oxidized in a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid in a
composition of 3/2 by volume at 80oC for 1 hour. The formation of the COOH groups on
MWNTs was verified by FTIR and the amount of COOH groups was 4.3 mmol/g by titration.
The COOH groups on MWNTs were then converted to acid chloride groups by reacting with
thionyl chloride (SOCl2) in DMF at 70oC for 24 hours. The acyl-chloride-functionalized
MWNTs was then grafted with a commercial grade of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), obtained
from Cargill Dow LLD, Chem. Co. and used as received, which has nM of 70,000 and
wM of 116,000 as determined by GPC. The grafting reactions were conducted in
chloroform at 80oC for 24 hours. Following careful filtrations to completely remove free
PLLA, the obtained PLLA-grafted MWNTs (or MWNTs-g-PLLA) was verified by DSC
(Figure 1) and appeared to well disperse in chloroform without precipitation for a long
period of time. Without grafting with PLLA, the MWNTs appeared to aggregate and
precipitate in chloroform in a short period of time. The content of PLLA in the synthesized
MWNTs-g-PLLA sample was about 36 wt% as determined by the thermal gravimetric
analyzer (TGA, TA instruments, TGA 2050).
Ⅲ-2 Preparations of PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA Nanocomposites
The PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites with compositions of 100/0, 100/1, 100/2,
100/5, and 100/10 were prepared by dissolving desired amounts of the commercial grade
PLLA and the synthesized MWNTs-g-PLLA in chloroform to have the concentration of 1 g
per 100-cm3 chloroform, followed by casting and vacuum drying at room temperature for
two days. The cast films with ca 0.1 mm in thickness appeared to be uniform showing a
good dispersion of the MWNTs-g-PLLA in the PLLA matrix, whereas the ungrafted
MWNTs gave aggregated clusters in the films. Without grafting modifications, MWNTs
aggregated and led to heterogeneous morphology, even with the aid of prolonged sonication,
whereas, with grafting modifications, the MWNTs-g-PLLA was uniformly dispersed in the
PLLA matrix.
Ⅲ-3 Characterizations of the PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA Nanocomposites
The cross sections of film samples were characterized by field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL 6700) (Figure 2). Glass transition temperatures (Tg),
cold-crystallization temperatures (Tcc), heats of cold-crystallization (Hcc), melting
temperatures (Tm), heats of melting (Hm) are obtained by heating the solid sample on a
DSC (TA Instruments, Q100 DSC). Weight fractional crystallinities (Xc, %) are calculated
by equation 1, whereHmo is the heat of melting of perfectly crystalline PLLA, which is 93
J/g .

determined by the thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA, TA instruments, TGA 2050).
Ⅳ-2 Preparations of PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites
The PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites with compositions of 100/0, 100/1, 100/2, and
100/5 were prepared by dissolving desired amounts of the commercial grade PLLA and the
synthesized MWNTs-g-PLLA in chloroform to have the concentration of 1 g per 100-cm3
chloroform, followed by casting and vacuum drying at room temperature for two days.
Ⅳ-3 Characterizations of the PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites.
Ⅳ-3-1 DMA Measurements
Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of pure PLLA and its nanocomposites was performed
with a TA Instruments dynamic mechanical analyzer (model 2980) for rectangular samples
with ~0.1 mm in thickness. The DMA was measured in the tensile mode at a constant
frequency of 1 Hz and a heating rate of 3 ℃/min scanning from 25 to 170 ℃.
Ⅳ-3-2 DSC Measurements
Ⅳ-3-2-1 Avrami equation
The sample of the PLLA and PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites were melted at 200
℃in an oven. Immediately, the sample were put into the cell of the advance establish at
crystallization temperature (Tc) in DSC for one hour. And the crystallization
temperature(Tc) is 110, 115, 120, and 130℃,respectively. These isothermal crystallization
times had been previously determined to be long enough for full crystallizations at these
temperatures The heat of fusion (ΔH) obtained from the exothermic peaks and we employ
the following equation(1) to calculate the relative crystallinity (Xt) of the different
crystallization time.

detector (Ordela Model 2201X, Oak Ridge Detector Laboratory Inc.) with 256 x 256
channels (active area 20 x 20 cm2 with ~1 mm resolution). The sample to detector distance
is 1500 mm long. The beam stop is around lead disk of 7 mm in diameter. All data were
corrected by the background (dark current and empty beam scattering) and the sensitivity of
each pixel of the area detector. The area scattering pattern has been radially averaged to
increase the efficiency of data collection compared with one-dimensional linear detector.
Data were acquired and processed on an IBM-compatible personal computer.

CNTs decreases with either temperature or time of the acid treatment. The structure or
morphology of the treated CNTs was investigated as a function of acid-treatment conditions
using TEM and FESEM. Figure 4 shows TEM images of the as-synthesized CNTs and the
as-treated CNTs. Prior to an acid treatment, the as-synthesized CNTs by the CVD method
exhibit a clear multi-walled tube structure with a diameter of about 30 nm. Depending on
treatment conditions, the acid treatments can damage the tube structure to a different extent.
As can be seen in Figure 4, the acid treatment at 80 oC for 2 hrs almost destroys the tube
structure. To a lesser extent, the tube structure can be seriously damaged by the acid
treatments at 60 and 80 oC for 3 hrs and 1 hr as shown in Figures 4C and 4D, respectively.
These serious damages apparently result from high levels of oxidation reactions that give
rise to low percents of the residual CNTs but high concentrations of the COOH groups on the
CNTs as can be seen in Table 1. The acid treatment at 25 oC for 12 hrs gives rise to a much
less damage to the tube structure (Figure 4F) and a much lower concentration of the COOH
groups (Table 1). The TEM images in Figure 4 are consistent with TGA data in Figure 3
and data in Table 1.
Figure 5 shows FESEM images of the as-synthesized CNTs by the CVD method and
the treated CNTs at various conditions. Prior to an acid treatment, the as-synthesized CNTs
appear to be unaligned and have lengths of larger than 1 m as can be seen in Figure 5A.
The as-treated CNTs having relatively high concentrations of COOH groups on the CNTs
appear to stick together and exhibit rodlike aggregates as can be seen in Figures 5B–5E.
The treated CNTs of having relatively low concentrations of COOH groups on the CNTs
give a loose aggregation as can be seen in Figures 5K and 5L. By examining carefully
Figures 4C and 4E for CNTs treated at 80 oC for 2 hours and 60 oC for 3 hours, respectively,
the rodlike aggregates can be seen to consist of tightly stuck fibers and have a diameter of
about 10 m, which is about 333 times bigger than the diameter of a single CNT. From
Table 1, the CNTs treated at 80 oC for 2 hours and 60 oC for 3 hours exhibit higher
concentrations of COOH groups, being 7.5 and 6.9 mmol/g, respectively, than the others.
These two acid treatments, giving similar concentrations of the COOH groups, result in
similar rodlike aggregates. The acid treatments at 80 oC for 1 hour and 25 oC for 24 hours
result in rugged sheet-like aggregates as can be seen in Figures 4F and 4H, consisting of
loosely stuck fibers as can be seen in Figures 4G and 4I, respectively. This can be
associated with the less COOH groups for these two treated CNTs, having 4.3 and 4.1
mmol/g (Table 1), respectively. The CNTs treated at 25 oC for 12 and 6 hours have much
less COOH groups, being 2.5 and 1.6 mmol/g, exhibiting no rodlike or rugged sheet-like
aggregates in Figures 4K and 4L, respectively. The finding that higher concentrations of
COOH groups on the treated CNTs result in denser aggregates can thus be attributed to the
intermolecular hydrogen bonding of COOH groups. Thus the treated CNTs can form
hydrogen-bonded aggregates in solid, with higher treatment temperatures or longer treatment
times resulting in denser aggregates.
To gain insight into the effects of the H bonding on the CNTs aggregation, their
solubility in solvents of different polarity and water of various pH values is investigated.
Solvents of different polarity include acetone, methanol, ethanol, and deionized water.
Water of various pH values includes 0, 4, 7, 10, and 12. Figures 6 and 7 are pictures to
present the solubility observations in deionized water and acetone, respectively, for the
as-synthesized CNTs and the treated CNTs at 80 oC for 1 and 2 hrs. In Figure 6, the
untreated CNTs can be seen to precipitate from the deionized water at 30 min after a 5-min
sonication and exhibit more precipitate one week later, although the precipitate appears to be
swollen. The CNTs treated at 80oC for 1 and 2 hrs dissolve or well disperse in the
deionized water for at least one week as can be seen in Figure 6. In contrast, the untreated
CNTs dissolve or well disperse in acetone for at least one week whereas the 80oC-treated
34
acid groups that aggregated together via the well-known intermolecular hydrogen bonding
between them. Since the level of the deprotonation of COOH increases in water of
increasing pH values, the solubility of the treated CNTs can be expected to increase in water
of increasing pH values, as can be seen by the homogeneous solutions in groups B and C of
Figure 8. This is because a greater deprotonation of COOH produces a higher amount of
the carboxylate anions that repel each other to form a homogeneous solution. The aqueous
solution of pH 12 unexpectedly, however, gives a lower solubility for the treated CNTs than
that of pH 10 does, as can be seen by the more transparent solution of pH 12 in Figure 8.
We postulate that a higher ionic strength attributed to a bigger amount of the sodium cations
in the aqueous solution of pH 12 causes the coagulation of some carboxylate anions and
leads to a more transparent solution as can be seen in Figure 8. The effects of the ionic
strength on the solubility of the acid-treated CNTs in water will be investigated later.
Now we would like to present more solubility data as a function of time. Figure 9
shows aqueous solutions of all 5 pH values containing the CNTs treated at 80oC for 2 hrs.
As can be seen in Figure 9, the treated CNTs initially appear to disperse in water of pH 0 for
5 min but precipitate 30 min or longer times after 5-min sonication. The aqueous solutions
of pH 4 or higher appear to be homogeneous for all times. Longer times for the solution of
a given pH seem to insignificantly alter the solubility of the treated CNTs as can be seen by
the insignificant changes in transparency for the solutions in Figure 9. For a given time
shorter than 24 hrs, the solubility (or in terms of opacity) of the treated CNTs in water of pH
4 or higher appears to follow the pH order of 12 10 > 7 > 4. For times longer than 1
week, the transparency of the aqueous solution of pH 12 seems higher than that of the
solution of pH 10. This indicates that the solubility of the treated CNTs is higher in water
of pH 10 than in that of pH 12 for times longer than 1 week. The pH dependence of
solubility can be quantitatively seen in Figure 10 where the visible light transmission of a
solution is plotted as a function of wavelength of the light. A previous study [8] also used
the UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy to determine the solubility of surface-modified CNTs in
chloroform. As can be seen in Figure 10, the transmission of a solution insignificantly
changes between the 5 min and the 1 month for all solutions except the solution of pH 12.
The solution of pH 12 is found to increase in transmission for a longer time such as one
month as can be seen in Figure 10. The quantitative observation in Figure 10 is consistent
with the qualitative (or visual) observation in Figures 8 and 9.
To gain insight into the microstrucure of the solubilized CNTs in water of various pH,
the sedimentary deposits from the aqueous solutions are obtained by evaporating the
solutions, followed by drying in a vaccum oven at 40 oC for 3 days before the FESEM
examinations. Figure 11 shows FESEM images of the sedimentary deposits of the CNTs,
untreated and treated at 80oC for 2 hrs, from the aqueous solutions of various pH. The
microstructure or morphology of the untreated CNTs deposited from the aqueous solution of
pH 7 appears to have a microstructure of non-woven fibers as can be seen in image (F).
The treated CNTs deposited from the aqueous solutions of pH 0, 4, and 7 as shown in
images (A–C) appear to have similar morphology to that of the untreated CNTs but these
treated CNTs exhibit much finer fibers and denser aggregative microstructure. In
comparison between images (A–C), the pH 7 solution gives the finest CNTs fibers and the
loosest aggregations in the deposit, followed by the pH 4 and the pH 0. The morphology of
the treated CNTs deposited from the aqueous solution of pH 10 appears to be very different
from that from the pH 0, 4, and 7 and exhibits a mixed microstructure of CNTs fibers and
NaOH which was added for adjusting the pH values. This added NaOH can be seen to
separate from the deposited CNTs fibers and locates at the top of the deposit from the
aqueous solution of pH 12 as shown in image (E), a demonstration that the NaOH is more
than the amount needed to form uniform morphology as in image (D).

Part Ⅱ Temperature Modulated DSC Studies on the Origin of Double Melting
Peaks in Isothermally Melt-crystallized PLLA
Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is a crystalline biodegradable and biocompatible aliphatic
polyester, widely used in biomedical applications [1-4]. Since crystalline morphologies of
PLLA can affect its physical properties and thus its applications, a thorough understanding of
the crystallization and melting behavior of PLLA is crucial. Although the melting behavior
of PLLA was reported in several papers [5-13], its multiple melting behavior was rarely
reported and was still controversial in its origin [14-16]. Crystalline polymers that were
reported to exhibit multiple melting behavior include, for example, poly(ether ether
ketone)(PEEK) [17,18], poly(ethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate)(PEN) [17],
poly(ethylene terephthalate)(PET) [19, 20], poly(butylene terephthalate) [21, 22],
poly(butylene naphthalate) [23], poly(butylene succinate) [24, 25], poly(ethylene succinate)
[25], and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)(PHB) [26, 27]. These polymers exhibiting multiple
melting behavior are mostly semi rigid in structure. PLLA having a high glass transition
temperature of near 60oC is considered a semi rigid polymer and reportedly exhibits double
melting behavior [14-16]. In a previous study, Yasuniwa and coworkers [14] reported
double melting behavior of PLLA during DSC heating of the nonisothermally
melt-crystallized PLLA. This double melting behavior of PLLA was observed only if
certain combinations of cooling rates and subsequent heating rates were applied. This
indicates that the double melting behavior of PLLA is a strong function of cooling and
heating rates. Yasuniwa and coworkers [14] used the melting-recrystallization model to
explain the double melting behavior of PLLA. Wang and Mano [15] reported that the
appearance of double melting peaks in PLLA is strongly dependent on the prior melting
conditions (melting temperature and time). They [15] attributed this double melting
behavior of PLLA to the thermal degradation of PLLA in the melt and the
melting-recrystallization mechanism. Kawaguchi and coworkers [16] observed double
melting peaks in PLLA after an amorphous PLLA sample was annealed at a temperature
between 105 and 120 oC. They [16], however, did not investigate into the origin of the
double melting peaks.
To investigate the still controversial origin of the double melting peaks in PLLA, the
isothermal melt-crystallizations of PLLA from the melt are conducted at various
temperatures in the range 100-110 oC for various times on a conventional differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC) in this work. The conditions for these isothermal
melt-crystallizations are chosen as such because the double melting peaks in PLLA are
easily observed at these conditions, as preliminarily determined in our lab. The origin of
the occurrence of these double melting peaks is then investigated using the
temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC) which is a relatively new
technique [17, 28-30]. In TMDSC, a sample is linearly heated with a superimposed low
frequency temperature oscillation resulting in a modulation in the heating profile. TMDSC
analysis provides total heat flow, such as that from conventional DSC, and the heat
capacity-related reversing heat flow. The non-reversing heat flow is obtained by
subtracting the reversing heat flow from the total heat flow. The reversing process during
heating a polymer includes the glass transition and parts of the endothermic crystal melting
while the non-reversing process contains all exothermic events such as crystallizations, the
endothermic enthalpy relaxation, and parts of the endothermic crystal melting. Much of the
complexity of TMDSC analysis originates from the contribution of the crystal melting to
both reversing and non-reversing processes. The reversing melting process includes the
melting of the polymer chains or chain segments near or on high-melting crystals, and with
52
rate thus gives a higher peak temperature and a bigger magnitude of the low endotherm.
Figure 3 shows the DSC heating curves of 10 oC/min for PLLA that was isothermally
melt-crystallized at 110oC for various times. As can be seen in Figure 3, a longer
crystallization time gives a bigger magnitude and a higher peak temperature of the low
endotherm but gives a smaller magnitude of the high endotherm with an insignificant shift in
the peak temperature. Sanchez and coworkers [31] reported that PLLA exhibited a regime
II to III transition temperature at around 118oC based on the Lauritzen-Hoffman theory.
The Tc studied in this work are thus in regime III where the nucleation rate is faster than the
crystal growth rate. Since the crystal growth rate in regime III can be increased by
increasing Tc or time, the findings that a higher Tc or a longer time gives a bigger magnitude
and a higher peak temperature of the low endotherm in Figures 2 and 3 are associated with
the enhancement of the secondary crystals growth rate.
The occurrence of double melting peaks in polymers during DSC heating has been
reported for several semicrystalline polymers [17-27]. Two most proposed models for this
double melting peaks are the double lamellar thickness model [35, 36] and the
melting-recrystallization model [37-40]. The double lamellar thickness model was
proposed by Cebe and Hong [35] and by Bassett et al [36]. They have suggested that the
double endothermic behavior is associated with the existence of two populations of crystal
lamellae with different thicknesses. As a result, melting of the thinner lamellae gives rise
to the low endotherm and melting of the thicker lamellae to the high endotherm. This
double lamellar thickness model is considered consisting of finite lamellar stacks (the stacks
are composed of a finite number of lamellae). According to this model, the low endotherm
shifts to higher temperatures or increases in magnitude with increasing crystallization times
at a given temperature or with increasing crystallization rates for a given time. This is
because the thin lamellae are thought to be imperfect and unstable. The increase in
crystallization time or crystallization rate can enhance the crystal perfection, leading to a
higher melting temperature. This double lamellar thickness model is consistent with the
observation that the low endotherm shifts to higher temperatures and increases in magnitude
with increasing crystallization rates for a given time in Figure 2 and with increasing
crystallization times at a given temperature in Figure 3. This model, however, can not
satisfactorily explain the decreases in magnitude of the high endotherm with increasing
crystallization rates in Figures 2 and with increasing crystallization times in Figure 3. This
finite lamellar stacks model is contrasted with the infinite lamellar stacks model proposed by
the advocates of the melting-recrystallization model [37-40]. According to this
melting-recrystallization model, the low endotherm is representative of the melting of most
of the lamellae initially present. The partially melted amorphous material then undergoes a
continuous process of recrystallization into thicker, and more perfect, lamellae, which melt at
higher temperatures. The scanning rate dependence was cited as evidence in favor of the
melting-recrystallization model [38]. The magnitude of the low endotherm in the double
endotherms was observed to increase with scanning rate. This increase in magnitude was
accompanied by a shift in peak position to higher temperature, leading to a single endotherm.
The authors suggest that this is caused by the fact that, at higher scanning rates, the
amorphous material has less time to recrystallize. Since the resolution of the DSC analysis
can be lowered with increasing scanning rate, the scanning rate dependence used as evidence
to prove the melting-recrystallization model is dangerous. According to this
melting-recrystallization model, as the sample is annealed for longer times at a temperature
or at higher temperatures for a given time, the lamellae thicken and become more perfect
[40]. Thus, the low endotherm shifts to higher temperatures and increases in magnitude
with increasing annealing time at a temperature or with increasing crystallization rate for a
given time. This model is clearly consistent with the observation on changes in peak
54
and 108 oC-crystallized PLLA samples in the non-reversing heat flow curves A and B in
Figure 5 where double melting peaks appear for both samples. These double melting peaks
in Figure 5 are attributed to the presence of two populations in crystal sizes. The double
lamellar thickness model can thus be used to explain the double endotherms for these two
samples in Figure 4. The observation of the relatively narrow double endotherms in the
reversing heat flow curves in Figure 6 for these two samples is consistent with the double
lamellar thickness model. For the melting-recrystallization process (using the
105oC-crystallized PLLA sample as an example), when the total, non-reversing, and
reversing heat flow curves are overlapped as in Figure 7, it can be clearly seen how the
position and the magnitude of the exothermic recrystallization peak in the non-reversing
curve affect the peak temperatures and the magnitudes of the low and high endotherms in the
total heat flow curve.
The double lamellar thickness model is not totally consistent with the observation of the
double melting peaks in Figure 3. Because in the case that the crystal size is bimodal in
distribution initially, a longer crystallization time should give a bigger magnitude and a
higher temperature for not only the low but also the high endotherm. In other words, in the
double lamellar thickness model the longer crystallization time can increase the thickness or
perfection of crystals, leading to increased magnitudes and temperatures of both the low and
high endotherms. TMDSC, as shown in Figures 8-10, is also used to investigate into the
origin of the double endotherms in Figure 3. From Figure 8, the melt-crystallizations at 110
oC for less than or equal to 30 min are incomplete because of the appearance of the cold
crystallization peaks at near 105 oC. The PLLA with longer melt-crystallization times do
not exhibit such cold crystallization peaks, indicating that the melt-crystallizations are
complete. The peak temperatures of both low and high endotherms insignificantly depend
on the crystallization times. From Figure 9, the exothermic cold crystallization peaks at
near 105 oC for short melt-crystallization times (10, 15, and 30 min) remain seen in the
non-reversing heat flow curves. For these three samples, there appears an additional
exothermic peak in near the range of 140 to 160 oC, attributed to the recrystallization.
These exothermic recrystallization peaks appear to be bigger for the sample with a shorter
crystallization time as can be seen in Figure 9. The exothermic recrystallization is not
clearly seen in Figure 9, however, for the sample with a longer crystallization time (longer
than or equal to 45 min). The double melting peaks in PLLA as crystallized at 110oC for
shorter times (10, 15, and 30 min) thus arise from the melting-recrystallization mechanism
while those obtained from the longer times (45, 60, 120, and 180 min) are attributed to the
presence of bimodal distribution in the crystal size. The observation of the broader double
endotherms in the reversing heat flow curves in Figure 10 for the samples with shorter
crystallization times is consistent with the melting-recrystallization model while the
observation of the narrower double endotherms agrees with the double lamellar thickness
model.
TMDSC has been reportedly used to study the multiple melting behavior for several
polymers [17, 18 25-27, 43]. Sauer and coworkers [17] used TMDSC to characterize the
melting and recrystallization behavior of PEN and PEEK exhibiting multiple melting
endotherms. In the same lab [43], TMDSC was used to investigate further on the melting
and recrystallization behavior of PEN and its blend with PET. They showed that TMDSC
provided excellent resolution of the recrystallization exotherm and the melting endotherm
during heating to characterize thermal properties of these polymers. Qiu and coworkers [25]
used TMDSC to investigate the multiple melting behavior of the nonisothermally
melt-crystallized poly(butylene succinate) and poly(ethylene succinate) from the melt.
They proposed the melting-recrystallization mechanism to explain the multiple melting
behavior of these two polymers based on the appearance of the recrystallization exotherm in

Part Ⅲ Effects of Carbon Nanotubes on Crystallization and Melting Behavior
of Poly(L-lactide) via DSC and TMDSC Studies
Carbon nanotube (CNT) has a very high aspect ratio and very high Young’s modulus
[1-3]; therefore, it has been expected to be an excellent reinforcement for polymeric
composites [4, 5]. To have effective reinforcing effects, CNT is normally surface-modified
before adding to a polymer matrix because CNT without surface modifications would
aggregate in polymer matrix leading to poor reinforcing effects, although the unmodified
CNT could enhance crystallizations of polymers such as poly(ethylene terephthalate)[6] and
poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate)[7]. CNT was reportedly surface-modified by grafting with
short chains [8, 9] or polymer chains [10-12] to prepare polymer/CNT nanocomposites.
PLLA is a biodegradable and biocompatible aliphatic polyester and is widely used in
biomedical applications [15-17]. Since crystalline morphologies of PLLA can affect its
physical properties and thus its applications, a thorough understanding of the crystallization
behavior of PLLA is crucial. Although the melting behavior of PLLA was reported in several
papers [18-26], its multiple melting behavior was rarely reported and still controversial in its
origin [27-29]. In a previous study, Yasuniwa and coworkers [27] reported double melting
behavior of PLLA during DSC heating of the nonisothermally melt-crystallized PLLA. This
double melting behavior of PLLA was observed only if certain combinations of cooling rates
and subsequent heating rates were applied. This indicates that the double melting behavior of
PLLA is a strong function of cooling and heating rates. Yasuniwa and coworkers [27] used
the melting-recrystallization model to explain the double melting behavior of PLLA. Wang
and Mano [28] reported that the appearance of double melting peaks in PLLA is strongly
dependent on the prior melting conditions (melting temperature and time). They [28]
attributed this double melting behavior of PLLA to the thermal degradation of PLLA in the
melt and the melting-recrystallization mechanism. Kawaguchi and coworkers [29]
observed double melting peaks in PLLA after an amorphous PLLA sample was annealed at a
temperature between 105 and 120 oC. They [29], however, did not investigate the origin of
the double melting peaks. We thus used TMDSC to investigate the controversial origin of
the double melting peaks in PLLA after isothermal melt-crystallizations at a temperature in
the range of 100-110oC for various times [30]. The TMDSC analysis [30] revealed that the
melting-recrystallization mechanism dominated the formation of the double melting peaks in
PLLA samples following melt-crystallizations at 110 oC for shorter times (less than or equal
to 30 min) or at lower temperatures (100, 103, and 105 oC) for 120 min while the double
lamellar thickness model dominated the formation of the double melting peaks in those
PLLA samples crystallized at higher temperatures (108 and 110 oC) for 120 min or at 110 oC
for longer times (higher than or equal to 45 min).
In this work, PLLA/CNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites were prepared and investigated into
70
calculated using equation 1, of the samples that were nonisothermally melt-crystallized at
5oC/min is significantly up from 2.8 wt% for pure PLLA to 11.8 and 14.2 wt% for the
PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites of 100/5 and 100/10, respectively. The
magnitudes of the exothermic cold-crystallization peaks (namely,Hcc) are, however, up and
down with increasing MWNTs contents. These exothermic peak magnitudes (Hcc) being
not monotonically up with increasing MWNTs contents, this is because a portion of
crystallization of PLLA was carried out during the prior cooling from the melt, as indicated
by the presence of the exothermic peaks in Figure 3.
In an attempt to investigate insight into the effects of MWNTs on the nonisothermal
melt-crystallization behavior of PLLA, a relatively new calorimetric technique, that is
TMDSC, is used. TMDSC has been used for studying the melting and crystallization
behavior in polymer systems [31] and it is widely accepted that it can supply additional
information compared to conventional DSC. In TMDSC, a sample is linearly heated with a
superimposed low frequency temperature oscillation resulting in a modulation in the heating
profile. TMDSC analysis provides total heat flow, such as that from conventional DSC,
and the heat capacity-related reversing heat flow. The non-reversing heat flow is obtained
by subtracting the reversing heat flow from the total heat flow. The reversing process
during heating a polymer includes the glass transition and parts of the endothermic crystal
melting while the non-reversing process contains all exothermic events such as
crystallizations, the endothermic enthalpy relaxation, and parts of the endothermic crystal
melting. Much of the complexity of TMDSC analysis originates from the contribution of
the crystal melting to both reversing and non-reversing processes. The reversing melting
process includes the melting of the polymer chains or chain segments near or on
high-melting crystals, and with negligible cooling, these molecules can nucleate and
recrystallize on these existing unmelted crystals [32, 33] while the non-reversing melting
process mostly originates from the complete melting of crystals. The non-reversing process,
at the time and temperature the measurement is made, is either irreversible or in some way
kinetically hindered. The non-reversing heat flow signal contains contributions from
processes that are reversible at frequencies lower than that chosen for the modulation. The
reversing process is a reversible process but the reversible process is not necessarily a
reversing process, unless at frequencies higher than that chosen for the modulation.
Figures 5-7 show TMDSC curves of total, non-reversing, and reversing heat flows,
respectively, as a function of temperature for the PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites
that were quenched at50oC/min from the melt. PLLA was found to exhibit behavior of a
slow melt-crystallization from the observation previously [30] that cooling rates of 5 and
10oC/min led to a low degree of crystallinity of only around 7 and 2 wt%, respectively, as
calculated by equation 1. The slow melt-crystallization behavior of PLLA is associated
with the rigid structure of PLLA molecules as indicated by a high Tg of near 60oC. As
72
Hm of the double melting peaks, and accordingly the calculated Xc (data not shown in this
report), increases. In comparison between Figure 8 and Figure 9 for a given sample, the
longer crystallization time causes the low endotherm to shift to a higher temperature but
negligibly affects the peak temperature of the high endotherm. The findings that the low
endotherm shifts to a higher temperature by a longer crystallization time and increases in
magnitude with increasing MWNTs loadings are associated with the enhancement of the
growth of the secondary crystals. PLLA was reported to exhibit a regime II to III transition
temperature at around 118oC [34] or around 115oC [21] based on the Lauritzen-Hoffman
theory. The melt-crystallization temperature (Tc = 110 oC) studied in this work is thus in
regime III where the nucleation rate is faster than the crystal growth rate, giving smaller
crystal sizes and imperfect crystals. A longer crystallization time and a higher MWNTs
loading that can increase the crystal growth can thus enhance the growth of the secondary
crystals, giving a higher temperature and a bigger magnitude of the low endotherm.
The occurrence of double melting endotherms during DSC heating of polymers has
been reported for several semicrystalline polymers [35-44]. Two most proposed models for
this double melting endotherm are the double lamellar thickness model [45, 46] and the
melting-recrystallization model [47-50]. The double lamellar thickness model is associated
with the existence of two populations of crystal lamellae with different thicknesses. As a
result, melting of the thinner lamellae gives rise to the low endotherm and melting of the
thicker lamellae to the high endotherm. This double lamellar thickness model is considered
consisting of finite lamellar stacks (the stacks are composed of a finite number of lamellae).
This model is consistent with the observation that the low endotherm shifts to higher
temperatures with increasing crystallization times at a given temperature. This is because
the thin lamellae are thought to be imperfect and unstable. The increase in crystallization
time can enhance the crystal perfection, leading to a higher melting temperature. In
addition, this model agrees also with the observation that the low endotherm increases in
magnitude with increasing crystallization rates (because of the addition of MWNTs) at a
given temperature for a given time. This is because the increase in crystallization rate at a
given temperature for a given time allows perfection of crystals, leading to a bigger
endotherm. This double lamellar thickness model is consistent with the observation in
Figures 8 and 9. This finite lamellar stacks model is contrasted with the infinite lamellar
stacks model proposed by the advocates of the melting-recrystallization model [47-50].
According to this melting-recrystallization model, the low endotherm is representative of the
melting of most of the lamellae initially present. The partially melted amorphous material
then undergoes a continuous process of recrystallization into thicker, and more perfect,
lamellae, which melt at higher temperatures. The scanning rate dependence was cited as
evidence in favor of the melting-recrystallization model [48]. The magnitude of the low
endotherm was observed to increase with increasing scanning rate. This increase in
74
range of 165–175 oC (the low and high endotherms at near 165 and near 172 oC, respectively)
arise from the melting of two different morphologies. As a result, being preceded with a
simultaneous melting and recrystallization, the subsequent double endotherms are dominated
by the double lamellar thickness model. The starting Tcc and the magnitude of the cold
crystallization peak in the range 85–120 oC and the magnitude of the recrystallization peak in
the range 150–160 oC in the non-reversing heat flow curves in Figures 10–12 decrease with
increasing MWNTs loading. This is again associated with the crystallization enhancement
by MWNTs during the melt-crystallizations at 110 oC for 10 min. For the melt-crystallized
PLLA samples at 110 oC for 180 min, the recrystallization peaks are not clearly seen in the
total and non-reversing heat flow curves (not shown in this report). Double melting
endotherms are still seen at near 165 and 172 oC. As a result, the double lamellar thickness
model is alone responsible for the double endotherms during heating of a given isothermally
melt-crystallized PLLA sample at 110oC for 180 min.
Figure 13 shows POM images of PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA of 100/0, 100/1, and 100/2
nanocomposites after melt-crystallizations at 150oC for 1 day from the melt. As discussed
earlier, PLLA exhibited a regime II to III transition temperature at around 118 [34] or 115 oC,
[21] based on the Lauritzen-Hoffman theory. The crystal growth rate of PLLA at 150oC,
which falls in regime II or I, is faster than the nucleation rate, a condition being able to give
big spherulites. POM images find that the sizes of spherulites of the 100/1 are slightly
smaller than those of pure PLLA because the nucleation rate of PLLA is enhanced by
MWNTs used as a nucleating agent. The black dots on the POM image of spherulites of
the 100/1 are from the MWNTs. The 100/2 nanocomposite does not give any spherulites
because the nucleation rate is much enhanced by MWNTs and is thus much faster than the
crystal growth rate. Figure 14 shows TMDSC reversing heat capacity (Cp) in the glass
transition region for pure PLLA and the PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites after
melt-crystallizations at 110oC for 180 min. When the glass transition temperature (Tg) is
chosen at the inflection point of a heat capacity curve in the region, the Tg is 59.4, 60.0, and
60.5 oC for pure PLLA, the 100/1, and the 100/2 nanocomposites, respectively. The Tg
clearly increases with increasing MWNTs loading. Moreover, the incorporation of
MWNTs causes PLLA to decrease the heat capacity increase (Cp) and the Cp at Tg. At Tg,
the Cp is around 0.67, 0.66, and 0.64 cal/g oC for pure PLLA, the 100/1, and the 100/2
nanocomposites, respectively. A decreased Cp with increasing MWNTs loading is
associated with an increase in the rigid-amorphous fraction (RAF) [51] which can be
calculated using equation 2 as follows.
RAF = 1–(Cp /Cpo) (2)
where Cp is the heat capacity increase at Tg for a nanocomposite and Cpo is that for pure
PLLA. From Figure 14, Cpo is 0.1 in cal/g oC. The RAF is thus found to increase by
2.5% and 5% for the 100/1 and 100/2 nanocomposits, respectively.

PartⅣ Crystallization, melting and morphology of PLLA in
PLLA/MWNT-g-PLLA Nanocomposite
In addition to the evidence that confirmed successful grafting of CNTs with PLLA in a
previous study [15], additional supporting evidence can be provided by the atomic force
microscopy (AFM) in this study. As can be seen in Figure 1, the AFM images show that
surface of pure PLLA film is smooth whereas that of the composite film shows many small
white particles as indicated by a black arrow in the PLLA/CNTs-g-PLLA 100/5 sample.
These small white particles are CNTs-g-PLLA and appear to uniformly disperse in the
PLLA matrix.
The PLLA matrix can be effectively reinforced and reduced in mobility by the
CNTs-g-PLLA as can be seen by an increase in storage modulus and glass transition
temperature via DMA measurements. The DMA measurements provide storage modulus
and the tanδof samples as a function of temperature as shown in Figure 2 and 3. The
storage modulus is indicative of the elastic modulus of the composite and tanδ, which is the
ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus, is sensitive to the structural transformation. The
peak temperatures of the tanδcurves in Figure 3 are defined as the glass transition
temperatures, Tg. As can be seen in Figure 2, storage modulus of the composites increases
with increasing content of the CNTs-g-PLLA. The storage modulus at 30 ℃, which is
below Tg of pure PLLA as shown in Figure 3, is up 129% from 1.4 GPa for pure PLLA to
3.2 GPa for the composite containing 5phr (per hundred parts of resin) of CNTs-g-PLLA.
Since the storage modulul is proportion to Young`s modulus [19], CNTs-matrix interaction
has to be strong enough to allow CNTs to express their high elastic properties. Apparently,
the PLLA grafts on the CNTs wall physically knot and tangle together with PLLA chain of
the matrix, leading to strong interactions between CNTs and the PLLA martix. In Figure 3,
the glass transition temperature(Tg) of the composites appear to increase with increasing
content of the CNTs-g-PLLA from 48.38℃ for pure PLLA to 58.93℃ for the composite
containing 5 phr of CNTs-g-PLLA. This indicates that the mobility of PLLA chains in the
matrix can be effectively reduced by the CNTs via the PLLA grafts that are miscible with the
PLLA matrix leading to an increase in Tg. In contrast, the unmodified CNTs were not
found to increase Tg of PLLA matrix (data not shown in this report).
The isothermal crystallization kinetics of PLLA in the composites is investigated
applying the Avrami equation as in equation 1 in which the Avrami exponent n reflects the
nucleation mechanism and growth dimension of the crystals and the rate constant k reflects
the crystallization rate. As can be seen in Figure 4 where the relative crystallinities (Xt) of
the composites isothermally crystallized at 110℃ are plotted as a function of time, a higher
CNTs-g-PLLA content gives a higher crystallinity in PLLA for a given crtstallization time.
Higher CNTs-g-PLLA contents in the composites result in less times to reach 100% of the
96
DSC data [15]. Figure 10 shows the spherulite radius was increase linearly with the
crystallization time for the composites of 100/0, 100/1, 100/2, and the spherulitic growth
rates (G) can be calculated from the slope of the spherulite radius vs time plots at 110℃.
Figure 11 shows the spherulitic growth rates (G) of the nanocomposites of 100/0, 100/1, and
100/2 at the different crystallization temperature (Tc). As can be seen in figure 11, the
spherulitic growth rates(G) increase with increasing MWNTs-g-PLLA loadings and the
spherulitic growth rates shows a bell shape with the maximum at about 117.5℃ for the pure
PLLA, and the other PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites of 100/1, 100/2 shows the
maximum to be located at about 121℃ and 122℃, respectively. The result is a similar
result to Figure 7 for the (1/t1/2) vs Tc plot. This might be associated with that MWNTs can
effectively enhance spherulitic growth rates (G) of PLLA as discussed previously.
Isothermal Melt-crystallizations. The melting behavior of PLLA has been reported in
several papers [22, 23] and its multiple melting behavior is also reported [24,25]. In order
to avoid the emergence of the multiple melting behavior, so we make the pure PLLA and
nanocomposites to be heated at 10 oC/min to 200 oC holding for 10 min, followed by cooling
at 50 oC/min to 110, 113, 115, 117 or 120 oC at which the samples were held for 300 min
for isothermal melt-crystallizations. Immediately after isothermal melt-crystallizations, the
samples were cooled to 40oC followed by heating to 200 oC to examine their isothermal
melt-crystallization behaviors. The glass transitions of the nanocomposites were
significantly broadened into the baseline and cannot be accurately located. The
crystallization exotherms is also disappeared. In figure 12 shows the relation of ΔH and
crystallization temperature (Tc) for the pure PLLA and PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA
nanocomposites. As can see from figure 12, the ΔH is increases with increasing the
MWNTs-g-PLLA content. This result suggests that the new crystallites might form in the
proximity to the MWNTs, which are known to induce crystallization of surrounding PLLA.
The equilibrium melting temperature (Tm0) for a semi-crystalline polymer can be
determined via Hoffman-Weeks procedure. In this procedure, the measured melting
temperature, Tm’s, of specimens crystallized at Tc are plotted against Tc and a linear
extrapolation to the line Tm=Tc, where the intercept gave Tm0. The equation of
Hoffman-Weeks extrapolation is carried out and one may obtained extrapolation temperature
according to eq.(5)

And the thickening factor (γ) ofPLLA crystallization in the pure PLLA and
PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites are investigated by the eq.(5). Figure 13 shows
Hoffman–Weeks plots for the pure PLLA and PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites.
The Tm0 and γobtained from Hoffman–Weeks plots are tabulated in Table 2. As can be

exhibited negative birefringence and the result implies that the crystallization morphology
was changed. Figure 15 shows WAXD profiles of PLLA and PLLA nanocomposites after
isothermal crystallization at 120 °C for one day. The pure PLLA exhibits a very strong
reflection at 2θ=16.66° due to diffraction from 200 or 110 planes.and another reflection peak
at 19.1° occurring from the (203) plane. The position of reflection peak confirmed that
PLLA is aα-form crystal. But the intensity of (010) diffraction plane at reflection peak of
2θ=14.7° is increases with increasing the MWNTs-g-PLLA content, and the result was
attributed to MWNTs induce PLLA to produce the new β-form crystallite. Leenslag and
Jennings et al. [29, 30] both achieved fibers with onlyβ-crystal by hot-drawing solution-spun
PLLA fibers at certain extreme conditions. In the studying, they also reported that the
β-form crystallite modification could only be prepared by the drawing of solution-spun
fibers of high molecular weights under drawing conditions leading to inhomogeneous draw.
Therefore, theβ-form crystallites are formed only when the samples are highly oriented and
theβ-form crystallite was easy produced at the higher isothermal crystallization temperature.
According our previous report [15], we find that MWNTs can significantly enhance the level
and rate of the nonisothermal melt-crystallization of PLLA during cooling from the melt.
Hence, we suggest that theβ-form crystallite was easy be produced at the lower temperature
and the β-form crystallite was also simultaneously induced the negative birefringence
morphology to take place. And the intensity of reflection peak at 2θ=16.66° and 19.1°
were increases with increasing the MWNTs-g-PLLA content ,and the imply that the
MWNTs also induce the PLLA to produce the α-form crystallite at the same time . The
result implied that MWNTs induce crystallization of surrounding PLLA and the reason is
similar the result of the figure 12. The weight-average long period associated with the
lamellar stacks can be calculated from the peak maximum of the Lorentz-corrected SAXS
profiles using the Bragg's equation, L=2π/ qmax. Figure 16 show the Lorentz-corrected
SAXS profiles of PLLA and other PLLA/MWNTs-g-PLLA nanocomposites after isothermal
crystallizations at 120℃. From the table 3, the composition variations of long periods are
21 nm, 19.26 nm and 19.15 nm for the composites of 100/0, 100/1, 100/2, respectively, and
the long period represents the sum of the crystal thickness (lc) and the amorphous layer
thickness (la). According the decrease in long period may thus stem from the thinning of
the crystal layer or the amorphous layer or both. In order to confirm the reason, we utilize
the interphase distribution function to determine the average thickness of the two layers [31].
The interphase distribution function, g1(z), is defined by the second derivative of the
one-dimensional correlation function,γ(z) [32,33]:

where b is the layer thickness, σis the lateral surface free energy, σe is the folding surface
free energy, Δhf is the enthalpy of fusion, n equals 4 in regime III and 2 in regime II, and k
is the Boltzmann constant. As can be in figure 18, we find the crystallization-regime
transition for the composites of 100/0, 100/1 and 100/2, and it clearly exhibits regime Ⅲ→
Ⅱ(KgⅢ/ KgⅡ) transitions at about 118℃, 122℃ and 122.3℃, respectively. And the
KgⅢ/ KgⅡ values for the composites of 100/1, 100/2, 100/5 are ca. 2.1358, 2.0601 and
2.1754, respectively, which are close to the theoretical value 2. The result is a similar to
Figure 6 and Figure 10 for the the (1/t1/2) vs Tc plot and G vs Tc plot, respectively.
According the literature [38], regime I, II and III are determined by nucleation rate (i) and
substrate completion rate (g). While at high crystallization temperature, crystallization rate
is controlled by the nucleation rate for regime I (i《 g). Crystallization rate of regimes II (I
= g) is controlled by nucleation rate and substrate completion rate simultaneously at the
middle region of crystallization temperature. At low crystallization temperature,
crystallization rate is controlled by the substrate completion rate, which is regime III (I 》g).
As can be seen in Table 4, the values(regime Ⅲ and regime Ⅱ) of Kg is slightly increases
with increasing content of the CNTs-g-PLLA and the σe values are also increases with
increasing the CNTs-g-PLLA content. The Kg values increase can be attributed to that
CNTs-g-PLLA serves as a nucleating agent and the nucleation rate (i) was more easily
happened at the higher crystallization temperature. Here, we employ the literature values
of Δhf = 1.11× 108 J/m [39], b0 = 5.17×10-10m[40], and σ = 12×103 J/m2 [40] to ca. the σe
values. The increases of σe values resulting from the addition of PLLA-grafted CNTs can
be attributed to CNTs lead to the formation of much more perfect crystals for the PLLA,
such as β-form crystallite and the result lead to the crystallinities degree increases. The
result is similar the DSC data and the WAXS data.
