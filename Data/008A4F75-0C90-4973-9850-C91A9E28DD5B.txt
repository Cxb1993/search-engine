D03 phase.), (c) and (d) ( 111 ) and ( 002 ) D03 DF, 
respectively. 
 
In order to determine the orientation relationship 
between the C14 precipitate and the (α+D03) matrix, ten 
different SADPs were taken from an area including the 
precipitate marked as “C” in Figure 2(a) and its 
surrounding (α+D03) phases. The results are shown in 
Figures 3(a) through (j). These SADPs were obtained by 
tilting the specimen about some specific reflections. The 
zone axes of the C14 precipitate and (α+D03) matrix in 
Figures 3(a) through (j) are [ 1 1 2 0 ]C14 , [ 1 1 1 ]m ; 
[ 2 2 4 3 ]C14 , [ 1 1 0 ]m ; [ 5 5 10 12 ]C14 , [ 3 3 1 ]m ;

[ 5 1 4 6 ]C14 , [ 3 1 1 ]m , respectively. For better 
demonstration, higher magnification of Figures 3(a), (b), 
(f) and (h) is shown in Figures 4(a) through (d), 
respectively. It is obvious in Figures 4(a) and (c) that the 
( 0 0 0 1 ) and ( 1 1 2 0 ) reflection spots of the C14 
precipitate are nearly parallel to the ( 1 1 2 ) and 
(1 1 1 )interplanar angles between the chosen reciprocal 
reflections of the C14 precipitate were obtained by 
calculation using the following equation [8]:reflection 
spots of the matrix, respectively. By means of this 
information, a stereographic plot of poles (superimposing 
the ( 0 0 0 1 ) projection of the C14 precipitate and the 
( 1 1 2 ) projection of the matrix) was constructed, as 
shown in Figure 5, where the (1 1 2 0 ) pole of the C14 
precipitate was made to match with the (1 1 1 ) pole of the 
α matrix. In this stereographic plot, the interplanar angles 
between the chosen reciprocal reflections of the C14 
precipitate were obtained by calculation using the 
following equation [8]:

It is clear in Figure 5 that the ( 1 1 0 0 ), (1 1 2 4 ), 
(1 1 2 1) et al. poles of the C14 precipitate would exactly 
or nearly coincide with the ( 1 1 0 ), ( 0 0 1 ), (1 1 2 ) et al. 
poles of the matrix. These results are quite consistent 
with the observations of SADPs in Figures 3 and 4. On 
the basis of the preceding analyses, the orientation 
relationship between the C14 precipitate and α matrix 
can be best stated as follows: ( 0 0 0 1 )C14//( 1 1 2 )m, 
( 1 1 0 0 )C14//( 1 1 0 )m, (1 1 2 0 )C14//(1 1 1 )m

(d) [ 0 0 0 1 ], (e) [ 1 1 2 0 ] and (f) [ 1 1 2 3 ], respectively. 
 
Finally, it is worthwhile to mention that the C14 
precipitate was also observed by many workers in 
Fe-Al-Nb, Fe-Al-Zr and Fe-Al-Ta alloys [4, 9-10]. 
However, we are aware of only one article, in which the 
orientation relationship between the C14 precipitate and 
α matrix was predicted. In 2005, Morris et al. reported 
that when the Fe-25Al-2Nb alloy was aged at 800℃ or 
900℃, C14 precipitate were formed within the α matrix; 
the orientation relationship between the C14 precipitates 
and α matrix was { 1 0 1 0 }C14//{ 1 0 1 }m , 
< 1 2 1 0 >C14 ≈ < 0 1 0 >m and < 0 0 0 1 >C14 ≈ < 1 0 1 >m , 
which was determined by using two SADPs [9]. 
Interestingly, it is noted here that the previous result of 
{ 1 0 1 0 }C14//{ 1 0 1 }m is indeed in agreement with that 
observed in Figure 4(c) of the present work.

Conclusion 
 
The as-quenched microstructure of the Fe-20 at.%Al-8 
at.%Ti alloy was a mixture of (α+D03) phases. When the 
alloy was aged at 1000 ℃ , C14 precipitates were 
observed to occur within the α matrix. The orientation 
relationship between the C14 precipitate and α matrix can 
be best stated as follows: 
( 0 0 0 1 )C14//( 1 1 2 )m , ( 1 1 0 0 )C14//( 1 1 0 )m , 
(1 1 2 0 )C14//(1 1 1 )m .

workers in the aged Fe-Al-Ti alloys [10]. In Fig. 2, it is also 
seen that the a/2<100> APBs were coated with a continuous 
layer of the disordered A2 phase. However, after prolonged 
aging at 900° C, some fine particles started to appear within 
the A2 phase. Figs. 3(a) and (b) are (111) and (200) D03 DF 
electron micrographs of the alloy aged at 900° C for 1 h, 
clearly revealing that the (111) D03 DF image and (200) D03 
DF image are morphologically identical. Since the (200) 
reflection spot comes from both the B2 and D03 phases [10,12], 
while the (111) reflection spot comes only from D03 phase, the 
fine bright particles at a/2<100> APBs presented in Figs. 3(a) 
and (b) are considered to be D03 phase. TEM examinations 
indicated that no evidence of the a/4<111> APBs could be 
observed. This result seems to imply that the B2 domains 
would grow up to the whole grains during aging. With 
increasing the aging time at 900° C, the amount of the D03 
particles at a/2<100> APBs increased and the disordered A2 
phase decreased, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 5(a), (111) D03 
DF electron micrograph of the alloy aged at 900° C for 24 h, 
indicates that at a/2<100> APBs, the amount of the D03 
particles increased considerably and a dark contrast could also 
be detected between the particles. However, a (200) D03 DF 
electron micrograph (Fig. 5(b)) reveals that the whole regions 
of the a/2<100> APBs were full bright in contrast. This 
indicates that the dark regions at a/2<100> APBs presented in 
Fig. 5(a) should be of the B2 phase. Consequently, when the 
alloy was aged at 900° C for longer time, the microstructure at 
the a/2<100> APBs was a mixture of (B2+D03) phases.

The fact that with increasing aging time at 900° C the 
size of the D03 domains existing in the as-quenched alloy 
increased and an A2 → (A2+D03) → (B2+D03) transition 
occurred at a/2<100> APBs is a remarkable feature in the 
present study. This feature has never been reported by previous 
workers in the Fe-Al-Ti alloy systems before. In order to 
clarify this feature, the quantitatively EDS analyses were 
undertaken. The results are shown in Table 1. It is seen in Table 
1 that when the alloy was aged at 900° C for 0.5 h, the Al and 
Ti concentrations in the D03 domains were much greater than 
those in the as-quenched alloy, and these concentrations were 
noticeably lower at a/2<100> APBs. The insufficient 
concentrations of both Al and Ti would cause the disordered A2 
phase to form at a/2<100> APBs. However, along with the 
growth of the D03 domains, partial Al and Ti atoms would 
proceed to diffuse toward the a/2<100> APBs. EDS analyses 
indicated that during the early stage of isothermal aging at 900
° C, the increased amount of Ti at a/2<100> APBs was more 
than that of Al. It implies that during aging, Ti redistributed 
first and then Al started to move appreciably. This result is 
consistent with that found by other workers in the Fe-Al-Ti 
ternary alloys [18], in which they reported that the diffusion of 
Ti is faster than that of Al. Furthermore, it is well-known that a 
small amount of Ti addition in the Fe-Al binary alloys would 
strongly enhance the formation of the D03 phase [10-12]. 
Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that the drastic increase of 
Ti concentration should be favorable for the formation of the 
fine D03 particles at a/2<100> APBs, which is consistent with 
the observation in Fig. 3. With increasing aging time at 900° C, 
both Al and Ti concentrations at a/2<100> APBs continue to 
increase significantly. It is thus expected that owing to the 
increase of Al and Ti, the amount of the fine D03 particles at 
a/2<100> APBs would increase and the microstructure of the 
remaining regions would transform from the disordered A2 
phase to B2 phase, as observed in Figs. 4 and 5. 
Finally, it is interesting to note that compared to the 
previously established isothermal sections of the Fe-Al-Ti

Abstract 
 
As-quenched microstructure of the Fe-23at.% Al-7at.% Ti alloy was a mixture of (A2+D03) phases. When the 
as-quenched alloy was aged at 1073K for moderate times, D03 domains grew preferentially along <100> directions and 
extremely fine B2 particles occurred at a/2<100> anti-phase boundaries (APBs). After prolonged aging at 1073K, the 
B2 particles would grow to occupy the whole a/2<100> APBs. Consequently, the stable microstructure of the alloy at 
1073K was a mixture of (B2+D03) phases.  
 
Keywords: phase transformation, electron microscopy, microstructure 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Effects of Ti addition on the microstructures of 
the Fe-rich Fe-Al binary alloys have been 
extensively studied by many workers.1-9) Based on 
these studies, it can be generally concluded that the 
addition of Ti in the Fe-Al binary alloys would not 
only pronouncedly raise the A2+D03 (or 
D03)→B2→A2 transition temperatures but also 
significantly expand the (A2+D03) phase field.3-9) In 
addition, a (B2+D03) two-phase field was reported 
to be detected in the Fe-Al-Ti ternary alloys.7-9) 
Interestingly, the (B2+D03) two-phase field has not 
been found by previous workers in the Fe-Al binary 
alloys before.10-12) However, to date, the existence of 
the (B2+D03) two-phase field in the Fe-Al-Ti ternary 
alloys was determined principally by means of X-ray 
diffraction and electron-probe microanalysis 
(EPMA).7-9) Little transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) information concerning the formation of the 
(B2+D03) two-phase microstructure has been 
provided in the literature. Therefore, the purpose of 
this work is an attempt to clarify the microstructural 
development for the formation of (B2+D03) phases 
in the Fe-23at.% Al-7at.% Ti alloy by TEM 
observation. 
 
Experimental Procedure 
 
(The Fe-23at.% Al-7at.% Ti alloy was prepared in a 
vacuum induction furnace by using high purity (99.99%) 
constituent elements. After being homogenized at 1523K for 
48h, the ingot was sectioned into 2-mm-thick slices. These 
slices were subsequently solution heat-treated at 1373K for 1h 
and then rapidly quenched into room-temperature water. The 
aging processes were performed at 1073K for various times in 
a vacuum heat-treated furnace and then quenched rapidly. TEM 
specimens were prepared by means of double-jet 
electropolisher with an electrolyte of 67% methanol and 33% 
nitric acid. TEM observation of microstructure was performed 
on a JEOL JEM-2000FX TEM operating at 200kV. This 
microscope was equipped with a Link ISIS 300 
energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) for chemical 
analysis. Quantitative analyses of elemental concentrations 
were made with a Cliff-Lorimer Ratio Thin Section method. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
An optical micrograph of the as-quenched alloy is shown 
in Figure 1(a). Figure 1(b) is a selected-area diffraction pattern 
(SADP) of the as-quenched alloy, exhibiting the superlattice 
reflection spots of the ordered D03 phase.13,14) Figure 1(c) is a 
(111) D03 dark-field (DF) electron micrograph, revealing the 
presence of fine D03 domains with a/2<100> APBs. Figure 1(d), 
a ( 200 ) D03 DF electron micrograph, shows the presence of 
small B2 domains with a/4<111> APBs. Since the sizes of both 
D03 and B2 domains are small, it is suggested that these 
domains were formed during quenching.11-17) In Figure 1(d), it 
is also seen that a high density of disordered A2 phase (dark 
contrast) was present within the B2 domains; otherwise there 
would be no dark contrast within these domains by using a 
( 200 ) superlattice reflection. Therefore, it is concluded that 
the as-quenched microstructure of the alloy was a mixture of 
(A2+D03) phases which were formed by an 
A2→B2→(A2+D03) transition during quenching. This result is 
similar to that reported by Mendiratta et al. in the 
Fe-(18~25)at.% Al-5at.% Ti alloys quenched from 1373K.3) 
When the as-quenched alloy was aged at 1073K, the D03 
domains grew rapidly, as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2(a) is a 
DF electron micrograph obtained by use of the ( 200 ) 
superlattice reflection in [001] zone, revealing that the D03 
domains grew preferentially along <100> crystallographic 
directions. This feature is also similar to that observed by 
Mendiratta et al..3) Figure 2(b), ( 111 ) D03 DF electron 
micrograph of the same area as Figure 2(a) with a higher 
magnification, shows that the a/2<100> APBs are fully dark in 
contrast. Figure 2(b), a ( 200 ) D03 DF electron micrograph, 
reveals that a high density of extremely fine particles could be 
observed at the a/2<100> APBs. Since the amount of the 
  12
Based on the preceding results, it is clear that when the 
present alloy was aged at 1073K for longer times, the D03 
domains existing in the as-quenched alloy grew and the B2 
phase started to occur at the a/2<100> APBs. This transition 
behavior has never been observed by other workers in the 
Fe-Al and Fe-Al-Ti alloy systems before. In order to clarify 
this feature, EDS analyses were undertaken. The average 
concentrations of the alloying elements were obtained from at 
least ten different EDS profiles of each phase. The results are 
summarized in Table 1.  
 
 
Table 1  
Chemical compositions of the phases revealed by Energy-Dispersive X-ray 
Spectrometer (EDS) 
 
Obviously, it is seen in Table 1 that both the Al and Ti 
concentrations in the D03 phase are much greater than those in 
the as-quenched alloy. It is thus expected that along with the 
growth of the D03 domains, the concentrations of both Al and 
Ti at a/2<100> APBs would be lacked. The EDS examinations 
indicated that the elemental concentrations of Al and Ti in the 
B2 phase are 20.13 and 3.52at.%, respectively. According to 
the phase diagram of Fe-Al binary alloys,11,12) it is seen that the 
microstructure of an Fe-20.13at.% Al alloy existing at 1073K 
should be a single disordered A2 phase, and no evidence of B2 
phase could be observed. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest 
that the existence of 3.52at.% Ti at a/2<100> APBs would be 
favorable for the formation of the B2 phase, rather than the A2 
phase. 
Finally, it is worthwhile to point out that the B2→D03 
ordering transition could be found to occur in the Fe-Al binary 
alloys with Al > 25at.%.12) However, it is clear in Figure 4 that 
the B2→D03 ordering transition could be detected and the Al 
content in the B2 phase was examined to be 20.13at.% only. 
This result implies that the existence of Ti would significantly 
lead the B2→D03 ordering transition to occur with lower Al 
content.

Conclusions 
 
The as-quenched microstructure of the Fe-23at.% 
Al-7at.% Ti alloy was a mixture of (A2+D03) phases. The 
(A2+D03) phases were formed by an A2→B2→(A2+D03) 
transition during quenching. When the alloy was aged at 
1073K for moderate times, the D03 domains grew 
preferentially along <100> directions and extremely fine B2 
particles occurred at a/2<100> APBs. After prolonged aging at 
1073K, the B2 particles would grow to occupy the whole 
a/2<100> APBs. Consequently, the stable microstructure of the 
alloy present at 1073K was a mixture of (B2+D03) phases.

L21 phase); (b) and (c) (200) and (111) L21 DF, respectively.  
 
Figure 2 is a (111) L21 DF electron micrograph of the alloy 
aged at 1173K for 3 h, clearly revealing that the L21 domains 
grew significantly and a/2<100> APBs were coated with the 
disordered A2 phase. However, after prolonged aging at 1173K, 
some tiny particles started to form within the A2 phase. A 
typical example is shown in Figure 3. Figures 3(a) and (b) are 
(111) and (200) L21 DF electron micrographs of the alloy aged 
at 1173K for 6 h, showing that the (111) DF image and the (200) 
DF image are morphologically identical. Therefore, it is likely 
to conclude that the microstructure of the alloy aged at 1173K 
for 6 h was also L21 phase and the a/2<100> APBs were coated 
with the disordered A2 phase. However, the (111) L21 DF 
electron micrograph of the same area as Figure 3(a) with a 
higher magnification revealed that the a/2<100> APBs were 
fully dark in contrast, as shown in Figure 3(c); whereas the 
(200) L21 DF electron micrograph showed that some tiny 
particles (indicated with arrows) could be observed at the 
a/2<100> APBs, as illustrated in Figure 3(d). Therefore, it is 
reasonable to deduce that the tiny bright particles present in 
Figure 3(d) should be of B2 phase, since the (111) reflection 
spot comes from the L21 phase only; while the (200) reflection 
spot can come from both the L21 and B2 phases.12,13) With 
continued aging at 1173K, the L21 domains continued to grow 
and a phase separation started to occur basically contiguous to 
a/2<100> APBs of the L21 domains. An example is shown in 
Figure 4. Figure 4(a) is a (111) L21 DF electron micrograph of 
the alloy aged at 1173K for 12 h, showing that the a/2<100> 
APBs broadened and well-grown L21 domains decomposed 
into fine L21 domains (designated as L21* phase to be 
distinguished from the original L21 phase) separated by dark 
layers. Figure 4(b) is a (200) L21 DF electron micrograph taken 
from the same area as Figure 4(a), clearly revealing that in 
addition to the presence of a few A2 particles, the whole region 
is bright in contrast. This indicates that the broadened dark 
lines on a/2<100> APBs and dark layers around the periphery 
of the L21* domains should be of the B2 phase. It is apparent 
that the B2 phase was formed at a/2<100> APBs and phase 
separation from L21 to (B2+L21*) occurred basically 
contiguous to the a/2<100> APBs. Figure 5(a) is a (111) L21 
DF electron micrograph of the alloy aged at 1173K for 24 h, 
indicating that with increasing aging time, the phase separation 
would proceed toward the inside of the L21 domains. Figure 
5(b), (200) L21 DF electron micrograph taken from the same 
area as Figure 5(a), clearly reveals that only one a/2<100> APB 
and one A2 particle (indicated with arrows in Figures 5(a) and 
(b)) could be observed. Figures 6(a) and (b) are (111) and (200) 
L21 DF electron micrographs of the alloy aged at 1173K for 36 
h, revealing that besides a little A2 phase, the well-grown L21 
domains decomposed into the (B2+L21*) phases completely.

concentration would lead the tiny B2 particles to form at 
a/2<100> APBs, which is also consistent with the Fe-Al-Ti 
phase diagram in Figure 7.10) In the phase diagram, it is clearly 
seen that the chemical composition of Fe-22.1 at.% Al-3.9 at.% 
Ti is close to the A2/B2 transition boundary. With increasing 
the aging time, the L21 domains continued to grow. The 
quantitative analyses revealed that the Al concentration of the 
L21 domains in the alloy aged for 6 h was 25.7 at.% while that 
for 12 h was 25.2 at.%, which gave a decrease of only 0.5 at.%. 
However, along with the enlargement of the L21 domain size, 
the volume fraction of the a/2<100> APBs would be lessened 
considerably. This means that the slight decrease of the Al 
concentration in the L21 domains would cause the Al 
concentration at a/2<100> APBs to increase appreciably. 
Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that due to the appreciable 
increase of the Al concentration, the A2 phase existing at 
a/2<100> APBs would be transformed to B2 phase,10) as 
observed in Figure 4(a). TEM observations indicated that along 
with the formation of the B2 phase, the phase separation from 
well-grown L21 to (B2+L21*) occurred basically contiguous to 
a/2<100> APBs. In the following description, we will attempt 
to discuss why the well-grown L21 domains underwent the 
phase separation. In the previous studies, it is well-known that 
the D03 phase could be found to exist in the Fe-Al binary alloys 
only at temperatures below 823K,12,13) and the Ti addition in 
the Fe-Al binary alloys would result in a particularly large 
increase of the D03(L21)→B2 transition temperature about 
60K/at.%.6-11) Obviously, the Ti concentration would be the 
predominant factor for the stabilization of the L21 phase at high 
temperature. In our previous study of the Fe-23 at.% Al-8.5 
at.% Ti alloy aged at 1173K for 6-24 h,14) it was found that the 
Ti concentration in the well-grown L21 domains was up to 
about 11.1 at.%, therefore, the L21 phase exhibited more stable 
and no evidence of the phase separation could be detected. 
However, when the present alloy was aged at 1173K for 6-24 h, 
the Ti concentration in the well-grown L21 domains was found 
to be only about 7.8 at.%, which is noticeably lower than that 
detected in the previous alloy. Therefore, it is plausible to 
suggest that owing to the lower Ti concentration, the 
well-grown L21 domains seemed not very stable at 1173K. 
Consequently, the well-grown L21 domains would separate to 
the mixture of the Ti-riched L21* and Ti-lacked B2 phase, as 
observed in Figures 4 through 6.

L21* 66.1 25.1 8.8 1173K, 36 h B2 69.5 24.2 6.3 
 
 Finally, three more features are worthwhile to note as 
follows: (1) In the previous study,14) it is clearly seen that the 
a/2<100> APBs of the well-grown L21 domains exhibited more 
pronounced anisotropy than those observed in the present alloy. 
The reason is possibly that the well-grown L21 domains in the 
previous alloy had significantly higher Ti concentration. (2) 
The chemical composition of the previous alloy had higher Ti 
and lower Al contents.14) When the previous alloy was aged at 
1173K, the L21 domains grew rapidly and the Ti atom was the 
major element for diffusing into the a/2<100> APBs. This 
effect caused the tiny L21 particles to precipitate preferentially 
at a/2<100> APBs.14) However, when the present alloy was 
aged at 1173K, the Ti concentration in the well-grown L21 
domains maintained to be about 7.8 at.% and the Al atom 
played the dominant role to diffuse into the a/2<100> APBs. 
Therefore, the tiny B2 particles were found to form at the 
a/2<100> APBs, rather than L21 particles. (3) According to the 
Fe-Al-Ti phase diagrams,6-11) the A2 phase can not appear for 
the Fe-24.6 at.% Al-7.5 at.% Ti alloy. However, a little A2 
phase was always observed in the present alloy aged at 1173K 
for 12-36 h. The reason for the difference is plausibly that the 
phase diagrams were determined by the Fe-Al-Ti alloys 
heat-treated at 1173K for a time period longer than 336 h, 
whereas the present alloy was aged for 36 h only. Actually, in 
the present study, it was found that when the as-quenched alloy 
was aged at 1173K for 3-36 h, the amount of the A2 phase was 
indeed decreased with increasing the aging time. 
 
Conclusions 
 
In the as-quenched condition, the microstructure of the 
Fe-24.6 at.% Al-7.5 at.% Ti alloy was the mixture of (A2+L21) 
phases. When the as-quenched alloy was aged at 1173K for 6 h, 
the L21 domains grew considerably and the B2 phase was 
formed at a/2<100> APBs as well as the phase separation from 
well-grown L21 to (B2+L21*) occurred basically contiguous to 
the a/2<100> APBs. After prolonged aging at 1173K, the phase 
separation would proceed toward the inside of the whole 
well-grown L21 domains. Consequently, the microstructure of 
the alloy aged at 1173K for 36 h was essentially the mixture of 
(B2+L21*) phases.
