Abstract 
This work investigated the thermoelastic 
interaction of a confocally elliptic layer with a 
remote uniform heat flow. Based on the 
technique of conformal mapping and the method 
of analytical continuation in conjunction with 
the alternating technique, the general 
expressions of the temperature and stresses in 
the coated layer and the matrix are derived 
explicitly in a series form. Some numerical 
results are provided to investigate the effects of 
the material combinations and geometric 
configurations on the interfacial stresses. It is 
found that the aspect ratio and the thermal 
modulus of the coated layer have a strong effect 
on the interfacial stresses.  
 
Keywords: Coated elliptic layer ,conformal 
mapping, analytical continuation, alternating 
technique 
 
1 Introduction 
During the past few decades, widespread 
attention has been given to the thermal stress 
problems in an elastic medium with inclusions, 
holes or cracks. Florence and Goodier [1] 
analyzed thermal stresses due to a uniform heat 
flux for an infinite plate with a hole of ovaloid 
form by using the dislocation method. By the 
use of the complex function method, Zhang and 
Hasebe [2] solved the problem of an adiabatic 
crack contained in an infinite plane that is 
thermally deformed in a temperature field 
caused by a single heat source. Based on the use 
of Laurent series expansion and the continuation 
method, Chao and Shen [3] provided a general 
solution to the thermoelastic problem of a 
circular inhomogeneity in an infinite matrix. 
Yoshikawa and Hasebe [4] analyzed the 
thermoelastic problems of a stationary heat 
source in an infinite plane with an elliptic rigid 
inclusion and an elliptic hole by using the 
mapping function and the thermal dislocation 
method. Chao and Shen [5] provided a general 
analytical solution for the elliptic anisotropic 
inclusion embedded in an infinite matrix subject 
to uniform heat flow by using the method of 
Lekhnitskii formulation and the technique of 
conformal mapping. Shen et al. [6] investigated 
the problem of an elliptic inclusion with a 
compliant interphase layer in plane 
thermoelasticity by using the complex variable 
techniques. All the aforementioned studies are 
limited to a hole or a two phase composite under 
thermal loadings. For multilayered solids, the 
problem becomes more complicated since the 
solutions are forced to satisfy both the boundary 
and interface continuity conditions. Based on 
the complex variable method and the technique

3 Temperature Field 
The complex function for an infinite 
homogeneous medium subjected to a remote 
uniform heat flow with the temperature gradient 
/q kτ = −  directed at an angle λ  with respect 
to the positive x - axis can be trivially given as 
0( ) iz e zλθ τ −=                         (8) 
With the aid of the mapping function (1), the 
homogeneous solution in the ζ − plane can be 
rewritten as

In the present problem, we assume that both 
the temperature and resultant heat flow are 
continuous across the interface L1 while an 
insulted condition is applied at the interface L2. 
To satisfy the continuity conditions of each 
interface, the temperature function of each 
medium can be assumed as

Since 1( )aθ ζ  can not satisfy the boundary 
(adiabatic) condition at the interface L2, the term 
1( )bθ ζ  holomorphic in 2ζ ρ≥  is introduced 
to satisfy the boundary condition at L2 such that

again introduce another pair of functions 
2 ( )θ ζ  and 2 ( )aθ ζ  respectively holomorphic 
in 1ζ ρ≥  and 1ζ ρ≤  to satisfy the 
continuity conditions along the interface L1 that

current problem. 
 
6 Conclusion 
An analytical solution to the problem of a 
coated elliptical hole embedded in an 
unbounded matrix subjected to remote uniform 
heat flow is provided in this paper. Note that the 
conventional Laurent series expansion technique 
is unable to avoid solving a system of 
simultaneous equations for a large number of 
unknown constants for the current problem. 
Based on the method of conformal mapping and 
the method of analytical continuation in 
conjunction with the alternating technique, the 
temperature and elastic fields are obtained as a 
transformation on the solution to the 
corresponding homogeneous solution. It is 
found that the thermal modulus of the confocal 
ring has a strong effect on the interfacial thermal 
stresses of the current problem. The present 
proposed method can also be extended to solve 
the corresponding elliptical inclusion problem 
with an intermediate layer.
