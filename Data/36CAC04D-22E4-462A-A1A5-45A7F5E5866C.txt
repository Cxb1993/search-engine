二、英文摘要 
  The ultimate goal for this research is to 
scale up the electrospinning process to 
obtain the nanofiber membranes in a 
continuous process.  To achieve this 
objective, a multiple-capillary electrode and 
conveying steel belt are successfully 
constructed in this laboratory. 
  Using the coaxial electrospinning device, 
two different fluids are simultaneously fed 
into a specially designed spinneret to 
produce the core/shell composite fibers.  
The core materials are extracted later using 
solvent extraction method to prepare hollow 
PAN fibers.  At present, PAN hollow 
fibers with an outer diameter of 900 nm and 
inner diameter of 500 nm are successfully 
obtained. 
  Effects of fiber roughness and the fiber 
crystal modifications on the transcrystal- 
lization of PP are also investigated using 
sPS fibers prepared from electrospinning 
process.  It is found that the nucleation rate 
of PP transcrysatllinity is lower for sPS 
fibers with a smaller fiber diameter (85 nm), 
compared to that on the diameter of 292 nm.  
The microstructure and formation 
mechanism of the transcrystalline layers is 
discussed as well.

3.2.2 內管流體--橄欖油 
油之密度和溶解度參數(δ)與 PAN 有
極大的差異，且用辛烷就可以輕易的從
oil/PAN 複合纖維中萃取出來。橄欖油導電
度接近零，但在電場的施加下也會形成
cone ， 由 於 油 為 小 分 子 無 法 產 生
entanglement，因此不會有纖維形成。以橄
欖油為內管流體，外層以 PAN/DMF 溶液
包覆進行電紡絲實驗後，再以辛烷將油萃
取出，可得中空的 PAN 纖維。 
雙軸噴絲在外管流量低於 1.0mL/h
時，外管的 cone 包不住內管的油。當外管
PAN/DMF 流量(Qs)為 1.5mL/h 時，形成穩
定 cone-jet mode 的 電 壓 範 圍 很 窄
(±0.5kV)，而且一定要由 Pulsating mode 慢
慢加電壓到 cone-jet mode。將收集的纖維
進行 POM 拍攝時，發現內管有油和內管無
油(Qc=0 mL/h)的照片有明顯的不同，在全
偏光下，與偏光板(polarizer)夾 45o 角之方
向，無含油的 PAN 纖維因為整根纖維內高
分子鏈具 orientation 關係，所以整根纖維
是亮的，而含油的纖維因中間層(core)為低
分子之 oil，無法形成分子鏈 orientation，
因此會形成暗的區域，被外層發亮之
oriented PAN 鏈區域(shell)所包覆，形成管
狀纖維外觀(圖 2.3)，POM 的影像證實了成
功地將 oil 導入 PAN 中空纖維內；在部份
偏光下，因為被 PAN 纖維包覆之油柱粗細

大，cone height 約為 2 mm，但成型纖維越
粗，bead 距離越遠且中空纖維外觀直徑與
內徑越均勻。改變工作距離為 15 cm 比較
發現：工作距離越小，cone 的體積越小，
纖維往上攀爬的情形越嚴重。所形成中空
的纖維的外觀上亦顯示：Qc 變大，纖維變
得均勻但外徑變粗。

3.3、PP 在奈米纖維表面穿晶之形成機制 
結晶性高分子在纖維表面上可能有穿
晶的形成。基本上穿晶的成長、結構與傳
統的高分子球晶有著明顯的差別。就型態
學而言，由於纖維的加入，使得纖維表面
因異質核化而產生大量的核集，等核子長
滿後高分子晶體延同一方向成長，形成柱
狀的結晶型態，此即為穿晶。一般相信纖
維表面穿晶之形成對複合材料的機械強度
會有正面影響，穿晶會增加纖維與基材間
介面的摩擦力，有助於增加複合材料的韌
性。本部分研究主要探討下列三項: 
(i) PP 和 sPS 分別在 PAN 纖維上的結
晶現象：研究在不同結晶溫度下 PAN 纖維
表面是否可形成穿晶。 
(ii) PP 在不同粗細 sPS 纖維表面上的
穿晶現象：已知 PP 會在許多不同種類的纖
維上形成穿晶(Kevlar、PET、carbon 纖維
等)，故想研究 PP 在 sPS 纖維上是否也有
穿晶現象。並進一步研究不同結晶溫度與
纖維粗細對穿晶的影響。因推測穿晶的形
成因素與纖維表面溝槽的大小、數目有
(a) (b) 
(c) (d) 
 8
溝槽寬度，則穿晶無法形成，因此高結
晶溫度時，因 ∆T 較小，此時 r*大，穿
晶不易形成。反之，若 r*小於溝槽寬度，
則穿晶可能形成。對於細的 sPS 纖維因
溝槽寬度較粗的 sPS 纖維小，因此要在
較低的結晶溫度下才有 PP 穿晶現象。 
(2)從實驗結果得知(圖 3.2 與 3.3)：不管 sPS
纖維粗細，隨著結晶溫度的降低，PP 成核
速率上升、N∞上升、ti則下降，因低的結
晶溫度 ∆T 較大(成核的 driving force 大)、
較易成核，所以有上述結果。 
(3)從實驗結果可知(圖 3.4)：細 sPS 纖維在
較低的結晶溫度才有 PP 穿晶現象，在相同
結晶溫度下，細 sPS 纖維表面上 PP 的成核
速率、N∞都較低、ti則較高。推測是因為
細 sPS 纖維的表面上除了溝槽較小外也較
少(易於成核的槽谷面積較少)。

不同升溫速率對 sPS 薄膜晶型種類的
影響實驗結果發現：當升溫速率越慢，α
晶型所佔比例越多(β型相對少)。利用上述
結果；改變升溫速率可造成 sPS 纖維晶型
的不同，進一步研究 sPS 纖維晶型的不同
是否會影響到 PP 成核速率。實驗結果顯示
(圖 3.5)：升溫速率 100°C/min 的成核速率
與升溫速率 10°C/min 相比，有所不同，升
溫速率 10°C/min 的成核速率、N∞都較大。
目前初步結果：升溫速率越慢，α晶型所佔
比例越多(相對 β型少)，成核速率越快。

ABSTRACT: By tuning the processing variables and solution properties using four different solvents
(dimethylformamide, o-dichlorobeneze, tetrahydrofuran, and chloroform), polystyrene (PS) fibers were prepared
by the electrospinning process to study the effects of these governing parameters on the morphological changes
of the charged cone and jet, as well as the diameter and birefringence of the fibers collected. Both jet diameter
(dj) and fiber diameter (df) were scaled with the processing variables, i.e., solution flow-rate (Q), applied voltage
(V) and working distance (H), with a power law model. Knowledge of these exponents provided insight into how
to manipulate the electrified jet and spun fibers for a given solution. Results showed that Q was the dominant
factor in determining the fiber diameter and the Q dependences of dj and df were approximately scaled with: dj
 Q0.5 and df  Q0.25. The applied electric field (V/H) did affect the cone volume and the length of the electrified
jet. Either increasing V or decreasing H produced a slightly thinner jet and smaller fiber, but the effects were not
significant due to the limited processing range available for the stable cone-jet mode, and the nonuniformity of
the electric field resulting from the point-to-plate electrode configuration used in this study. Regardless of the
variations of the processing variables (Q, V, and H), a master curve between dj and df was found for a solution
with fixed properties, from which a simple equation was obtained and expressed by: df  mdj0.45 where m was
a prefactor depending upon solution properties, such as the viscosity (Łï), conductivity () and surface tension.
Values of m were found to be lower for solutions with lower viscosity and/or higher conductivity, and were
successfully scaled to be as follows: m  Ło0.38-0.12. As far as the solution properties were concerned, the
concentration emerged as the most important parameter because of its interaction with all aspects of the
electrospinning process. The rheological properties of the polymer solution showed a significant effect on the
formation of smooth electrospun fibers. On the basis of the Graessley’s concentration-molecular weight diagram,
various PS fiber morphologies were discussed and the minimum polymer concentration at a given polymer
molecular weight required for preparing smooth PS fibers could be estimated. For the present PS solutions, a
scaling law was found between the fiber diameter and solution viscosity: df  Ło0.41, if other governing parameters
(Q, V, H, , and surface tension) were fixed.
1. Introduction
Driven by the wide-spread interest in the nanofiber applica-
tions, a considerable amount of research has been aimed at
gaining a better understanding of the electrospinning process
which is a potential process to prepare polymer fibers with a
diameter ranging from micro- to nanometer scale depending on
the spinning conditions.1-3 Although some polymer fibers can
be obtained by electrospinning from the melt,4-6 majority of
the fibers are currently prepared from the solution state due to
its advantages of low viscosity and controlled conductivity.
Three main issues are involved to obtain the desirable fibers,
i.e., polymer solution properties, processing variables, and the
spinning environments. The properties required for an appropri-
ate solvent for the selected polymer are good miscibility, low
boiling point, low surface tension and high conductivity (or
dielectric constants).7-12 In contrast with electrospraying, the
prerequisite for the fiber formation is the existence of sufficient
entanglement density in the polymer solutions.13-15 Increasing
the solution viscosity (concentration) will prohibit the formation
of beaded fibers and increase the fiber diameter. As far as
processing variables are concerned, the flow-rate, applied
voltages, working distance and capillary diameter are essential
to be considered.16-21 Atmosphere control (humidity and
temperature) of the spinning environment is also crucial
sometimes to certain polymer solutions which could interact
with the moisture.22,23 By manipulation of all these parameters,
a variety of structure differences of the electrospun fibers can
be obtained.
Electrospinning is involved with the polymer flow with free
surface after emerging from a capillary, followed by the bending
and stretching of the jet due to the surface charge repulsion.24-27
Most of the previous work in the literature has focused on the
relation between the processing parameters and fiber morphol-
ogy, leaving the important subjects of the free surface variations
unexplored. To manipulate the free surface of the electrified
jet is the first and determinant step to control the morphology
of the electrospun fibers. A crucial question is as follows: How
do these processing parameters affect the flow free surface, such
as the Taylor cone, jet length, and jet diameter? We believe
there should be a more intimate relation between the fiber
morphology and the cone/jet dimensions, rather than the
processing parameters alone. To fulfill this knowledge gap is
our main objective of this study. In this article, effects of solution
properties and processing variables on the Taylor-cone volume,
jet diameter, jet length, bending instability, and the morphology
as well as the birefringence of the collected PS fibers were
reported. Some general empirical laws relating fibers diameters
to processing variables and jet diameters were discussed to give
a deep insight into manipulate the fibers desired. In addition,
the minimum polymer concentration, at a given PS molecular
weight, required for preparing smooth electrospun PS fibers was
determined based on our rheological measurements and the
Graessley’s concentration-molecular weight diagram.

especially at low flow-rates and high PS contents. At a given
Q, both the Vs and the operating voltage range (Vus-Vs) are
lower for the solutions with higher viscosities, indicating that a
higher electric field is required for less viscous solutions to
develop a stable cone-jet mode. This unexpected phenomenon
is attributed to the variation of Taylor cone due to its change
of size and shape from concave to convex (as shown in the
inset of Figure 2) for solutions with gradually reducing PS
contents. A larger convex-shaped cone gives rise to a larger
surface area, thereby requiring a higher applied voltage to reach
a critical surface charge for issuing a jet from the apex. When
Q is too high, the inertial term of flow becomes important,
resulting in a continuous jet from the needle tip to the collector
in the absence of bending instability. On the other hand, stable
cone-jet mode disappears at a sufficiently low Q, plausibly due
to the insufficient solution delivered to the controlled cone
volume after the jet formation at the apex of the meniscus. In
other words, the volume of Taylor cone fluctuates with time
during electrospinning and a steady volume is never reached,
giving rise to the intermittent jet formation. The minimum Q
for stable cone-jet mode was found to depend on the solution
viscosity; being 1.0, 0.7, and 2.0 mL/h for 6, 13, and 23 vol %
solution, respectively. Hence, a steady electrospinning of 23
vol % PS/DMF solutions is infeasible for Q lower than 2.0 mL/
h.
For the 6 vol % PS solution, addition of TEBAC salts leads
to an effective increase in the conductivity, being 239 and 1346
íS/cm respectively for 0.1 and 1 wt % TEBAC content, but
the viscosity and surface tension of the PS solutions remain
unchanged, being 11.9 cP and 35.9 dyn/cm respectively. As
shown in Figure 1b, the functioning domain is also varied with
the solution conductivity. The higher conductivity the solution
is, the larger the applied voltage required to develop a cone-jet
mode. On the basis of the observation of cone morphology being
discussed in section 3.2, the cone volume increases with
increasing solution conductivity, which reduces the surface
charge density and in turn a larger V is required to issue a stable
jet. As the conductivity increases, moreover, the maximum Q
for stable cone-jet mode is reduced and the functioning domain
becomes narrower, which is consistent with previous findings
in electrospraying to produce monodisperse droplets.32 For the
solution with 1 wt % TEBAC, the operating Q range for stable
cone-jet mode is rather limited, being 0.3-0.5 mL/h. At a flow-
rate larger than 0.5 mL/h, in contrast, more than two jets are
observed and dance around the Taylor cone clockwisely. The
formation of the multiple jets is due to the presence of high
surface charge density and high mobility of the solutions used.
The details of the multiple-jet effect on the electrospun fibers
are currently under investigation and will be reported in a future
article. In this following report, stable cone-jet mode with a
single jet is ensured to ascertain a process with good reproduc-
ibility.
Figure 2 shows the variation of jet diameter along the spinning
line until the jet end where bending instability takes place,
leading to the infeasibility of jet diameter measurements via
laser diffraction method. The last point along each profile stands
for the jet end, by which the terminal jet diameter (dj) is
determined and its position denotes the jet length. The inset
images are the cone morphologies at various PS concentrations.
It is noted that the jet diameter decays rapidly within the first
5 mm from the apex of the Taylor cone and reaches a stable dj
beyond. As the concentration increases, the cone region becomes
shorter and concave in profile, the diameter of the electrified
jet increases, but the membrane diameter collected on the
grounded net remains unaffected. Moreover, for a more
concentrated solution, a longer electrified jet is observed, which
is in agreement with results obtained by Baumagarten.33 When
plotting the logarithm-logarithm plots of dj (or df) vs Ło, a
scaling law exists for the present PS/DMF solutions; i.e., dj 
Ło0.32 and df  Ło0.54. Although the derived exponent for the

reaches a plateau value of ca. 8 m/s within first 10 mm traveling
length regardless of the Q used. In comparison with the fluid
velocity in the needle, 1 mm/s, it is rather intriguing to note
the high acceleration of jet velocity due to the driving force
associated with electric repulsions. The traveling time for fluids
from the cone apex to the jet end is rather short, ca. 6.7 ms,
which further supports the assumption of limited evaporation
of DMF solvent in consideration of its high boiling temperature.
Hence, the decreasing jet diameter along the jet length is
primarily dependent on the electrical forces and the polymer
concentration from the cone vertex to the jet end is hardly
affected. Moreover, the elongational rate is as high as 800
s-1 when the fluids eject from the cone apex and plug flow
patterns are developed near the jet ends, as shown in Figure
4b. Although the terminal jet velocity is independent of the Q,
solution viscosity did play a role in determining the jet velocity.
According to Figure 2, in fact, the terminal velocity increases
with decreasing viscosity and an extremely high jet velocity of
25 m/s can be reached for the 6 vol % PS solution with a
viscosity of 10 cP, leading to an elongational rate as high as
1000 s-1.
Because of the viscoelastic characteristics of polymer solu-
tions, viscoelasticity becomes important in cases where the
relaxation time (ôo) of polymer chains is of the same order of
magnitude or larger than the time scale of the deformation. The
ratio of these two time scales is called the Deborah number,35
and is expressed as De ) ôo/L/Vj  ôoø , where ø is the
elongational strain rate. Depending on PS concentrations, the
values of ôo are in the range of 1-10 ms (as given in Figure
12c), which gives rise to De in a range of 1-10, suggesting
that transient effects are important and relaxation phenomena
dominates the process. Thus, elasticity plays an important role
in the jet adjacent to the cone apex, where significant stretching
of the polymer chains is evident26 due to the convergent flow
and a high degree of chain orientation is developing. After the
jet velocity is stable, the elongational strain rate becomes small
enough that Newtonian-fluid flow is applicable and the inertial
term is dominant.
On addition extreme amount of TEBAC salts (0.05 wt %)
into the 23 vol % PS/DMF solution, the solution conductivity
increased significantly from 0.2 íS/cm to 49 íS/cm but others
properties (viscosity and surface tension) remained relatively
unchanged. For this more conductive solution, similar trends
of the Q dependence of the cone height and jet length were
observed, i.e., larger cone volume with shorter jet for increasing
Q.37 At a given Q, however, the enhanced conductivity leads
to the cone/jet morphologies having a larger cone and shorter
jet, as shown in Figure 5, in comparison with the solution
without salts. It is of significance to note the reduction of jet
diameter to produce a jet velocity as high as 10 m/s, suggesting
a higher elongational strain rate for the more conductive solution.
For four different PS solutions with various properties, Figure
6 shows the Q dependence of the measured dj (open symbols)
and the as-spun fiber diameter, df (filled symbols). We found
that both dj and df increased with Q and followed a power law
model, i.e., dj  Q0.48 and df  Q0.25 for the PS/DMF solution,
dj  Q0.66 and df  Q0.27 for the PS/DMF/TEBAC solution, dj
 Q0.44 and df  Q0.23 for the PS/THF/LiClO4 solution, dj 
Q0.49 for the PS/o-DCB/Bu4NClO4 solution. The exponent for
the dj-Q relation is in accordance with the theoretical consid-
erations: dj  Q1/2 derived by Can˜a´n-Calvo,36 whereas a larger
exponent (dj  Q2/3) has been proposed by Fridrikh et al.38 based
on a simple assumption of df ) 0.5dj, which may not be valid
since different exponents for the Q dependence of the dj and df
are obtained experimentally as shown in Figure 6. Experimen-
tally, hence, we found that there is a scaling law between dj (or
df) and Q, and the exponent for dj is ca. two times larger than
that for df.

For the PS/DMF 23 vol % solutions, the diameter of the
collected membrane (spinning area) remains constant regardless
of the Q used but the fiber birefringence is found to decrease
slightly with increasing Q (Figure 8). When the solution
conductivity is enhanced by adding the salts, both the membrane
diameter and birefringence of the as-spun fibers are increased,
indicating the spinning effectiveness associated with the electric
repulsive forces. It should be noted that the fiber birefringence
obtained by electrospinning is equivalent to that for melt-spun
PS fibers at a drawdown ratio40 of ca. 200. The Herman’s
orientation factor of the electrospun PS fibers is estimated to
be 0.067 by assuming the intrinsic birefringence of PS being
-0.15.41
3.3. Effects of Applied Voltages (V). Increasing applied
voltage at a given H and Q, the cone height (or volume) was
gradually reduced but the jet length was increased. Ultimately,
the contracted cone interacted with the needle surface at a
sufficiently high voltage and interruption of the stable cone-jet
spinning mode occurred. The voltage range available for stable
cone-jet mode was rather limited; i.e., Vus/Vs was generally
smaller than 2.0 as shown in Figure 1. Typical results of the
voltage effects are displayed in Table 2, showing that the
voltages required for the stable cone-jet mode were in the range
of 9-12 and 9.5-12.5 kV for the PS/THF/LiClO4 and PS/DMF/
TEBAC solutions, respectively. As the applied voltage was
increased, both the jet diameter and fiber diameter were slightly
reduced but the effect was not pronounced in some systems
when their standard deviations were taken into account. In
contrast, the fiber birefringence was increased with increasing
V, indicating a better chain orientation developed within the
electrospun fibers. This finding was not unexpected because
one might propose that a larger V should lead to a greater charge
density on the jet surface, induce a stronger repulsive force,
and result in a smaller dj. As shown in Figure 9, in fact, PS/
DMF solutions show the expected trends and the V dependence
of dj can be scaled as: dj  V-0.57, indicating a stronger
dependence of dj on the applied voltage in comparison with
the Q effect. For the PS/THF/LiClO4 solution, however, the
exponent was negative but very small, ca. -0.04, indicating
the insignificant dependence of dj and df on the voltage applied.
One should be also aware of the plausible error in determining
the power law exponent in consideration of the limited voltage
range (9-12 kV, Figure 9) available for the regressions.
Nevertheless, similar dj-V scaling laws with negative sign of
approximate exponents have also been obtained in other polymer
systems, such as the poly-3-hydroxybutyrtae/CF and PAN/DMF
solutions, and the details will be given in a separate article. On
the basis of our results, we conclude that the applied voltage
shows a negative effect on dj, which in turn exhibits a similar
effect on df as shown in Figure 9. Our results are different from
the previous findings by Demir et al.18 and Fennessey et al.21
on electrospinning polyurethane fibers and PAN fibers, respec-
tively. They reported that jet diameter at a constant distance
from the cone apex appeared to increase as the voltage was
increased. However, one should be aware that the jet diameter
is distance dependence as shown in Figure 4 and the jet length
varies with the applied voltage (Table 2), leading to the necessity
to determine the precise location of jet end in order to obtain
more reliable dj. In addition, the jet end fluctuates for certain
distance owing to the incipient of asymmetric instability.
It is rationalized that significant drawing of jet takes place
in the bending instability region, simultaneously resulting in
the rapid evaporation of solvent due to the increasing surface
area of the whipping jets. Jet drawing becomes infeasible when
the jet viscosity increases to a certain level at which the electric
repulsive forces is incapable (in vain) to pull the solidified fiber
any longer. On the basis of the assumption of volume conserva-
tion, we further assumed that the terminal jet with a diameter
of dj was drawn to a specific draw ratio and then the solvent
was subsequently evaporated to produce a dry fiber with a
diameter of df during bending instability Therefore, the draw
ratio associated with the bending instability was estimated to
be: lf/lj  (dj/df)2, where lf and lj were the phantom lengths
of the fiber and jet, respectively and their ratio was termed the
drawability of the whipping jet. The larger the drawability of
the jet possesses, the higher level of chain orientation is
expected. As shown in Table 2, good correlation between the
calculated drawability and the fiber birefringence measured is
obtained under the condition of voltage changes. Hence, when
the PS solutions are electrospun at a higher voltage, thinner PS
fibers with larger birefringence are obtained due to the presence
of larger repulsive forces in the bending jet which exhibits a
stronger drawing (larger lf/lj).
3.4. Effects of Working Distance (H). Due to the point-to-
plate configuration for our electrospinning setup, nonuniform
electric field was expected and the apparent applied electric field
was tentatively expressed by the V/H ratio. By varying H at
fixed V and Q, the H effect on the cone/jet/fiber dimensions
was discussed. For allowing solvent evaporation during jet
whipping, H should be sufficiently larger than the jet length,
otherwise the liquid jet will touch down the ground collector
and/or wet fibers are obtained. A typical plot of the measured
jet diameter along the jet length is given in Figure 10, where a
23 vol % PS/DMF solution with 0.01 wt % TEBAC is tested.
Increasing the working distance led to a shorter jet and a longer
Taylor cone with a profile from being concave to convex. The
typical H dependence of the measured cone/jet/fiber dimensions
is given in Table 3. Both dj and df were slightly increased (or
relatively unchanged in consideration of the standard deviations)
although H had been approximately doubled. These findings
suggested that it was the applied V rather than the V/H, which
played a dominant influence on the jet and fiber diameters during

related to the intrinsic viscosity [Ł] through the equation: c*
 2.5[Ł]. For PS, the crossover from the semidulte to
concentrated regime occurs for c greater than 0.1 g/cm3. The
viscoelastic properties in the dilute and semidilute solutions (
< 0.1) are dependent upon the solvent used due to differences
in the chain expansion factor, whereas that the molecular weight
between entanglements (Me) is insensitive to solvent power. For
sufficiently high polymer concentrations ( > 0.1), the effect
of solvent quality becomes negligible and the scaling of the
molecular weight between entanglements with concentration is
well established as:(Me)sol  18700c-1, where 18700 is the
Me in the PS melt. On the other hand, for highly entangled PS
in the semidilute regime ( < 0.1) different scaling rule for the
concentration dependence of Me is derived and expressed to
be: (Me)sol  10200c-1.3.45 It should be noted that different
scaling laws are applied for the concentration dependence of
Me in different regimes. On the basis of the assumption that
the critical molecular weight for entanglement Mc is ca. two
times of Me, the boundary between the entangled and nonen-
tangled regimes, i.e., the locus of c vs M, was determined and
given in Figure 13 (thick solid lines) for monodisperse PS used.
Moreover, it should be noted that the transition in Figure 13 is
likely to be relatively gradual due to the broad MWD of samples
used in this study. Conceptually, electrospinning will be
degenerated into electrospraying when the solution character-
istics falls in the regimes of I, II, and IV, where chain
entanglement is absent. Similar considerations but different
expressions have been proposed by McKee et al.13 and Shenoy
et al.15 in discussing other electrospinning solutions.
The applicability of Figure 13 is found to be rather useful in
predicting the electrospun features of PS with a given MW.
For examples, the MW of PS that we used is ca. 300K; varying
solution concentration from low to high (as shown by the arrows
in Figure 13) essentially alters the morphology of the electrospun
product from spherical particles (points a and b, 1-6 vol %),
beaded fibers (points c-e, 13-19 vol %) finally to smooth fibers
(point f, 23 vol %). Our results are in accord with previous
findings13,15 who claimed smooth fibers without any beads are
obtained at a concentration higher than 1.75c. Hence, Figure
13 provides a convenient guideline to determine the minimum
concentration to produce smooth PS fibers at a given PS MW.
For examples, a solution with a volume fraction of 0.03 is
sufficient for PS with a MW of 1880K to prepare electrospun
fibers with fiber structure, a volume fraction higher than 0.37
is required for the PS with a MW of 100K, whereas fiber
structure is never observed for the PS with a MW of 4K in all
the concentrations prepared.
3.7. Effects of Solvents. It is expected that solvent properties
play an important role in determining the spinnability of polymer
solutions.12,46 It seems to us that the solvent possessing high
volatility, high conductivity (or dielectric constant) and good
solvent characteristic of the polymer is the most desirable one.
For all the solvents that we used, the solvent affinity to the PS
chains is on the order of THF  CF > o-DCB > DMF as shown
in Table 1, where solubility parameters are given. Moreover,
both THF and CF are more volatile than DMF and o-DCB. The
conductivity of DMF solvent is the highest among them.
Although o-DCB was a relatively good solvent compared with
DMF, no smooth fibers but spherical particles were obtained
for PS/o-DCB solutions with concentrations even up to 29 vol
%, where sufficiently high entanglement density was already
reached according to Figure 13. Using the high speed camera,
the breakup of electrified jets into droplets of different sizes
(similar to Figure 3b) was discernible despite the presence of
stable cone-jet mode during electrospinning. The failure to
obtain fiber structure was ascribed to the extremely low
conductivity (10-5 íS/cm) and high boiling temperature of the
o-DCB solvent. By adding small amount of TEBAC salts, the
spinnability of PS/o-DCB became feasible and smooth PS fibers
were able to prepare under appropriate processing conditions.
On the other hand, PS/DMF solutions could be readily elec-
trospun due to the high conductivity characteristics. In com-
parison with the spinnability of these two solutions, it seems
that solution conductivity outweighs the polymer-solvent
affinity.
Although the processing time is quite small (1ms), solvent
evaporation might be enhanced when a high volatile solution
is delivered from the needle tip to the jet end, where the polymer
concentration might be increased. Thus, it is the solution just
prior the bending instability, not necessarily the solution in the
needle, should possess sufficient entanglement density in order
to obtain smooth spun fibers. During the chaotic jet whipping,
a significant increase of entanglement density associated with
the pronounced solvent evaporation is for certain. Using THF
(or CF) as a solvent, PS concentration less than 13 vol %
produced merely droplets (diameter  10 ( 2 ím for 6 vol %
and 12 ( 2 ím for 12 vol %), 14 vol % solution gave the trace
presence of fibers, and finally up to 18 vol % solution generated
ribbon-shaped PS fibers having a diameter of 12 ( 6 ím with
porous surface. However, the width of PS ribbons was not
uniform and “beaded-ribbon” structure was seen, the large knots
being 33 ím wide and separated by a distance of ca. 6 ím.
Numerous elongated pores (750 nm long and 300 nm wide)
along the PS fibers were observed on the surface. The presence
of pores is attributed to the interaction of THF (or CF) with
moisture during jet whipping, and the pore size is related with
the humidity.21,22 By adding 0.05 wt % LiClO4 salts into 18
vol % PS/THF solutions, the solution conductivity was en-
hanced, leading to the facts that the jet length was significantly
reduced and the as-prepared fibers were smooth and thin (2.5
( 0.7 ím) with reduced pore diameter (60-100 nm). Similar
transitions from beaded to smooth fibers were also reported in
the literature.9,11,16,39 The disappearance of beaded fibers might
be attributed to the significant migration of the soluble salts to
the jet surface under the strong electric field, which in turn
produces a core/shell regime within the electrified jet. Thus,
phase separation takes place, giving the presence of “polymer-
rich” and “polymer-poor” phases in the core and shell fluids,
Figure 13. Typical concentration-molecular weight diagram of
viscoelastic regimes for PS in DMF solvent. Several regimes for various
chain conformations can be identified: (I) dilute, (II) semidilute and
not entangled, (III) semidiluted and entangled, (IV) concentrated and
not entangled, and (V) concentrated and entangled.

4. Conclusions
In summary, two main features are required to prepare smooth
fibers by electrospinning, i.e., the formation of cone-jet spinning
mode and the existence of chain entanglement in the solution
at the electrified jet end prior to the bending instability. We
have measured the rheological properties of PS solutions with
various compositions to reveal the minimum concentration for
the chain entanglements and discussed their influences on the
electrospun fibers. Moreover, the applicability of the molecular
weight-concentration diagram as proposed by Graessley is also
provided to guide the process and good agreement with
experimental observations is reached. The solution conductivity
also plays a key role in determining the fiber spinnability. For
the solution possessing insufficient entanglement density for
preparing smooth fibers, increasing the conductivity by adding
salts will lead to the transformation of fiber morphology from
beaded fibers (without salt addition) to smooth fibers at the same
polymer concentration.
The processing parameters applied for the electrospinning can
be classified into two groups; the first is the solution properties
(viscosity, conductivity and surface tension) and the second is
the processing variables (flow-rate, applied voltage, and working
distance). Variations of the processing variables result in the
change of the free surface of the cone-jet which in turn changes
the jet diameter, producing electrospun fibers with different
diameter and birefringence. Regardless of the processing
variables, a master curve between dj and df is obtained for a
given PS solution, and a simple relation is derived: df ) mdjn,
where m is a prefactor depending upon the solution properties
and the exponent n is approximately constant, 0.45. As far as
the solution properties are concerned, solution viscosity is the
most important factor in determining the fiber diameter and a
power law relation is derived: df  Ło0.41 when the solution
conductivity and surface tension are fixed. These simple scaling
laws are helpful in guiding the preparation of electrospun fibers
desired.

二、英文摘要 
  The ultimate goal for this research is to 
scale up the electrospinning process to 
obtain the nanofiber membranes in a 
continuous process.  To achieve this 
objective, a multiple-capillary electrode and 
conveying steel belt are successfully 
constructed in this laboratory. 
  Using the coaxial electrospinning device, 
two different fluids are simultaneously fed 
into a specially designed spinneret to 
produce the core/shell composite fibers.  
The core materials are extracted later using 
solvent extraction method to prepare hollow 
PAN fibers.  At present, PAN hollow 
fibers with an outer diameter of 900 nm and 
inner diameter of 500 nm are successfully 
obtained. 
  Effects of fiber roughness and the fiber 
crystal modifications on the transcrystal- 
lization of PP are also investigated using 
sPS fibers prepared from electrospinning 
process.  It is found that the nucleation rate 
of PP transcrysatllinity is lower for sPS 
fibers with a smaller fiber diameter (85 nm), 
compared to that on the diameter of 292 nm.  
The microstructure and formation 
mechanism of the transcrystalline layers is 
discussed as well.

3.2.2 內管流體--橄欖油 
油之密度和溶解度參數(δ)與 PAN 有
極大的差異，且用辛烷就可以輕易的從
oil/PAN 複合纖維中萃取出來。橄欖油導電
度接近零，但在電場的施加下也會形成
cone ， 由 於 油 為 小 分 子 無 法 產 生
entanglement，因此不會有纖維形成。以橄
欖油為內管流體，外層以 PAN/DMF 溶液
包覆進行電紡絲實驗後，再以辛烷將油萃
取出，可得中空的 PAN 纖維。 
雙軸噴絲在外管流量低於 1.0mL/h
時，外管的 cone 包不住內管的油。當外管
PAN/DMF 流量(Qs)為 1.5mL/h 時，形成穩
定 cone-jet mode 的 電 壓 範 圍 很 窄
(±0.5kV)，而且一定要由 Pulsating mode 慢
慢加電壓到 cone-jet mode。將收集的纖維
進行 POM 拍攝時，發現內管有油和內管無
油(Qc=0 mL/h)的照片有明顯的不同，在全
偏光下，與偏光板(polarizer)夾 45o 角之方
向，無含油的 PAN 纖維因為整根纖維內高
分子鏈具 orientation 關係，所以整根纖維
是亮的，而含油的纖維因中間層(core)為低
分子之 oil，無法形成分子鏈 orientation，
因此會形成暗的區域，被外層發亮之
oriented PAN 鏈區域(shell)所包覆，形成管
狀纖維外觀(圖 2.3)，POM 的影像證實了成
功地將 oil 導入 PAN 中空纖維內；在部份
偏光下，因為被 PAN 纖維包覆之油柱粗細
不均，造成纖維外觀有 bead 的現象。當內
管流量(Qc)越大時，cone 的大小改變不
大，cone height 約為 2 mm，但成型纖維越
粗，bead 距離越遠且中空纖維外觀直徑與
內徑越均勻。改變工作距離為 15 cm 比較
發現：工作距離越小，cone 的體積越小，
纖維往上攀爬的情形越嚴重。所形成中空
的纖維的外觀上亦顯示：Qc 變大，纖維變
得均勻但外徑變粗。 
 
如圖 2.4 所示：隨著外管流量 Qs 變
大，穩定電壓變高，纖維 bead to bead 距離

22.5、25、29wt%時，黏度大於外管 8wt% 
PAN/DMF 黏度，則可進行電紡絲實驗，且
黏度越高，製程越容易穩定。先前的結論：
外管流體黏度需夠高，才能將內管流體順

取低黏度外管流體進行實驗，為增加製程
穩定性與可操作性，可使內管針口比外管
針口突出。雖然外管黏度低，但內管流體
黏度若比較高，亦有同等效果。換言之，
內外管流體只要有其一具備高黏度，使流

外層流體的邊界明顯可辨。且當內管黏度

3.3、PP 在奈米纖維表面穿晶之形成機制 
結晶性高分子在纖維表面上可能有穿
晶的形成。基本上穿晶的成長、結構與傳
統的高分子球晶有著明顯的差別。就型態
學而言，由於纖維的加入，使得纖維表面
因異質核化而產生大量的核集，等核子長
滿後高分子晶體延同一方向成長，形成柱
狀的結晶型態，此即為穿晶。一般相信纖
維表面穿晶之形成對複合材料的機械強度
會有正面影響，穿晶會增加纖維與基材間
介面的摩擦力，有助於增加複合材料的韌
性。本部分研究主要探討下列三項: 
(i) PP 和 sPS 分別在 PAN 纖維上的結
晶現象：研究在不同結晶溫度下 PAN 纖維
表面是否可形成穿晶。 
(ii) PP 在不同粗細 sPS 纖維表面上的
穿晶現象：已知 PP 會在許多不同種類的纖
維上形成穿晶(Kevlar、PET、carbon 纖維
等)，故想研究 PP 在 sPS 纖維上是否也有
穿晶現象。並進一步研究不同結晶溫度與
纖維粗細對穿晶的影響。因推測穿晶的形
成因素與纖維表面溝槽的大小、數目有
(a) (b) 
(c) (d) 
 8
溝槽寬度，則穿晶無法形成，因此高結
晶溫度時，因 ∆T 較小，此時 r*大，穿
晶不易形成。反之，若 r*小於溝槽寬度，
則穿晶可能形成。對於細的 sPS 纖維因
溝槽寬度較粗的 sPS 纖維小，因此要在
較低的結晶溫度下才有 PP 穿晶現象。 
(2)從實驗結果得知(圖 3.2 與 3.3)：不管 sPS
纖維粗細，隨著結晶溫度的降低，PP 成核
速率上升、N∞上升、ti則下降，因低的結
晶溫度 ∆T 較大(成核的 driving force 大)、
較易成核，所以有上述結果。 
(3)從實驗結果可知(圖 3.4)：細 sPS 纖維在
較低的結晶溫度才有 PP 穿晶現象，在相同
結晶溫度下，細 sPS 纖維表面上 PP 的成核
速率、N∞都較低、ti則較高。推測是因為
細 sPS 纖維的表面上除了溝槽較小外也較
少(易於成核的槽谷面積較少)。 
 
不同晶型 sPS 纖維對成核速率的影響 
不同升溫速率對 sPS 薄膜晶型種類的
影響實驗結果發現：當升溫速率越慢，α
晶型所佔比例越多(β型相對少)。利用上述
結果；改變升溫速率可造成 sPS 纖維晶型
的不同，進一步研究 sPS 纖維晶型的不同
是否會影響到 PP 成核速率。實驗結果顯示
(圖 3.5)：升溫速率 100°C/min 的成核速率
與升溫速率 10°C/min 相比，有所不同，升
溫速率 10°C/min 的成核速率、N∞都較大。
目前初步結果：升溫速率越慢，α晶型所佔
比例越多(相對 β型少)，成核速率越快。

ABSTRACT: By tuning the processing variables and solution properties using four different solvents
(dimethylformamide, o-dichlorobeneze, tetrahydrofuran, and chloroform), polystyrene (PS) fibers were prepared
by the electrospinning process to study the effects of these governing parameters on the morphological changes
of the charged cone and jet, as well as the diameter and birefringence of the fibers collected. Both jet diameter
(dj) and fiber diameter (df) were scaled with the processing variables, i.e., solution flow-rate (Q), applied voltage
(V) and working distance (H), with a power law model. Knowledge of these exponents provided insight into how
to manipulate the electrified jet and spun fibers for a given solution. Results showed that Q was the dominant
factor in determining the fiber diameter and the Q dependences of dj and df were approximately scaled with: dj
 Q0.5 and df  Q0.25. The applied electric field (V/H) did affect the cone volume and the length of the electrified
jet. Either increasing V or decreasing H produced a slightly thinner jet and smaller fiber, but the effects were not
significant due to the limited processing range available for the stable cone-jet mode, and the nonuniformity of
the electric field resulting from the point-to-plate electrode configuration used in this study. Regardless of the
variations of the processing variables (Q, V, and H), a master curve between dj and df was found for a solution
with fixed properties, from which a simple equation was obtained and expressed by: df  mdj0.45 where m was
a prefactor depending upon solution properties, such as the viscosity (Łï), conductivity () and surface tension.
Values of m were found to be lower for solutions with lower viscosity and/or higher conductivity, and were
successfully scaled to be as follows: m  Ło0.38-0.12. As far as the solution properties were concerned, the
concentration emerged as the most important parameter because of its interaction with all aspects of the
electrospinning process. The rheological properties of the polymer solution showed a significant effect on the
formation of smooth electrospun fibers. On the basis of the Graessley’s concentration-molecular weight diagram,
various PS fiber morphologies were discussed and the minimum polymer concentration at a given polymer
molecular weight required for preparing smooth PS fibers could be estimated. For the present PS solutions, a
scaling law was found between the fiber diameter and solution viscosity: df  Ło0.41, if other governing parameters
(Q, V, H, , and surface tension) were fixed.
1. Introduction
Driven by the wide-spread interest in the nanofiber applica-
tions, a considerable amount of research has been aimed at
gaining a better understanding of the electrospinning process
which is a potential process to prepare polymer fibers with a
diameter ranging from micro- to nanometer scale depending on
the spinning conditions.1-3 Although some polymer fibers can
be obtained by electrospinning from the melt,4-6 majority of
the fibers are currently prepared from the solution state due to
its advantages of low viscosity and controlled conductivity.
Three main issues are involved to obtain the desirable fibers,
i.e., polymer solution properties, processing variables, and the
spinning environments. The properties required for an appropri-
ate solvent for the selected polymer are good miscibility, low
boiling point, low surface tension and high conductivity (or
dielectric constants).7-12 In contrast with electrospraying, the
prerequisite for the fiber formation is the existence of sufficient
entanglement density in the polymer solutions.13-15 Increasing
the solution viscosity (concentration) will prohibit the formation
of beaded fibers and increase the fiber diameter. As far as
processing variables are concerned, the flow-rate, applied
voltages, working distance and capillary diameter are essential
to be considered.16-21 Atmosphere control (humidity and
temperature) of the spinning environment is also crucial
sometimes to certain polymer solutions which could interact
with the moisture.22,23 By manipulation of all these parameters,
a variety of structure differences of the electrospun fibers can
be obtained.
Electrospinning is involved with the polymer flow with free
surface after emerging from a capillary, followed by the bending
and stretching of the jet due to the surface charge repulsion.24-27
Most of the previous work in the literature has focused on the
relation between the processing parameters and fiber morphol-
ogy, leaving the important subjects of the free surface variations
unexplored. To manipulate the free surface of the electrified
jet is the first and determinant step to control the morphology
of the electrospun fibers. A crucial question is as follows: How
do these processing parameters affect the flow free surface, such
as the Taylor cone, jet length, and jet diameter? We believe
there should be a more intimate relation between the fiber
morphology and the cone/jet dimensions, rather than the
processing parameters alone. To fulfill this knowledge gap is
our main objective of this study. In this article, effects of solution
properties and processing variables on the Taylor-cone volume,
jet diameter, jet length, bending instability, and the morphology
as well as the birefringence of the collected PS fibers were
reported. Some general empirical laws relating fibers diameters
to processing variables and jet diameters were discussed to give
a deep insight into manipulate the fibers desired. In addition,
the minimum polymer concentration, at a given PS molecular
weight, required for preparing smooth electrospun PS fibers was

especially at low flow-rates and high PS contents. At a given
Q, both the Vs and the operating voltage range (Vus-Vs) are
lower for the solutions with higher viscosities, indicating that a
higher electric field is required for less viscous solutions to
develop a stable cone-jet mode. This unexpected phenomenon
is attributed to the variation of Taylor cone due to its change
of size and shape from concave to convex (as shown in the
inset of Figure 2) for solutions with gradually reducing PS
contents. A larger convex-shaped cone gives rise to a larger
surface area, thereby requiring a higher applied voltage to reach
a critical surface charge for issuing a jet from the apex. When
Q is too high, the inertial term of flow becomes important,
resulting in a continuous jet from the needle tip to the collector
in the absence of bending instability. On the other hand, stable
cone-jet mode disappears at a sufficiently low Q, plausibly due
to the insufficient solution delivered to the controlled cone
volume after the jet formation at the apex of the meniscus. In
other words, the volume of Taylor cone fluctuates with time
during electrospinning and a steady volume is never reached,
giving rise to the intermittent jet formation. The minimum Q
for stable cone-jet mode was found to depend on the solution
viscosity; being 1.0, 0.7, and 2.0 mL/h for 6, 13, and 23 vol %
solution, respectively. Hence, a steady electrospinning of 23
vol % PS/DMF solutions is infeasible for Q lower than 2.0 mL/
h.
For the 6 vol % PS solution, addition of TEBAC salts leads
to an effective increase in the conductivity, being 239 and 1346
íS/cm respectively for 0.1 and 1 wt % TEBAC content, but
the viscosity and surface tension of the PS solutions remain
unchanged, being 11.9 cP and 35.9 dyn/cm respectively. As
shown in Figure 1b, the functioning domain is also varied with
the solution conductivity. The higher conductivity the solution
is, the larger the applied voltage required to develop a cone-jet
mode. On the basis of the observation of cone morphology being
discussed in section 3.2, the cone volume increases with
increasing solution conductivity, which reduces the surface
charge density and in turn a larger V is required to issue a stable
jet. As the conductivity increases, moreover, the maximum Q
for stable cone-jet mode is reduced and the functioning domain
becomes narrower, which is consistent with previous findings
in electrospraying to produce monodisperse droplets.32 For the
solution with 1 wt % TEBAC, the operating Q range for stable
cone-jet mode is rather limited, being 0.3-0.5 mL/h. At a flow-
rate larger than 0.5 mL/h, in contrast, more than two jets are
observed and dance around the Taylor cone clockwisely. The
formation of the multiple jets is due to the presence of high
surface charge density and high mobility of the solutions used.
The details of the multiple-jet effect on the electrospun fibers
are currently under investigation and will be reported in a future
article. In this following report, stable cone-jet mode with a
single jet is ensured to ascertain a process with good reproduc-
ibility.
Figure 2 shows the variation of jet diameter along the spinning
line until the jet end where bending instability takes place,
leading to the infeasibility of jet diameter measurements via
laser diffraction method. The last point along each profile stands
for the jet end, by which the terminal jet diameter (dj) is
determined and its position denotes the jet length. The inset
images are the cone morphologies at various PS concentrations.
It is noted that the jet diameter decays rapidly within the first
5 mm from the apex of the Taylor cone and reaches a stable dj
beyond. As the concentration increases, the cone region becomes
shorter and concave in profile, the diameter of the electrified
jet increases, but the membrane diameter collected on the
grounded net remains unaffected. Moreover, for a more
concentrated solution, a longer electrified jet is observed, which
is in agreement with results obtained by Baumagarten.33 When
plotting the logarithm-logarithm plots of dj (or df) vs Ło, a
scaling law exists for the present PS/DMF solutions; i.e., dj 
Ło0.32 and df  Ło0.54. Although the derived exponent for the

reaches a plateau value of ca. 8 m/s within first 10 mm traveling
length regardless of the Q used. In comparison with the fluid
velocity in the needle, 1 mm/s, it is rather intriguing to note
the high acceleration of jet velocity due to the driving force
associated with electric repulsions. The traveling time for fluids
from the cone apex to the jet end is rather short, ca. 6.7 ms,
which further supports the assumption of limited evaporation
of DMF solvent in consideration of its high boiling temperature.
Hence, the decreasing jet diameter along the jet length is
primarily dependent on the electrical forces and the polymer
concentration from the cone vertex to the jet end is hardly
affected. Moreover, the elongational rate is as high as 800
s-1 when the fluids eject from the cone apex and plug flow
patterns are developed near the jet ends, as shown in Figure
4b. Although the terminal jet velocity is independent of the Q,
solution viscosity did play a role in determining the jet velocity.
According to Figure 2, in fact, the terminal velocity increases
with decreasing viscosity and an extremely high jet velocity of
25 m/s can be reached for the 6 vol % PS solution with a
viscosity of 10 cP, leading to an elongational rate as high as
1000 s-1.
Because of the viscoelastic characteristics of polymer solu-
tions, viscoelasticity becomes important in cases where the
relaxation time (ôo) of polymer chains is of the same order of
magnitude or larger than the time scale of the deformation. The
ratio of these two time scales is called the Deborah number,35
and is expressed as De ) ôo/L/Vj  ôoø , where ø is the
elongational strain rate. Depending on PS concentrations, the
values of ôo are in the range of 1-10 ms (as given in Figure
12c), which gives rise to De in a range of 1-10, suggesting
that transient effects are important and relaxation phenomena
dominates the process. Thus, elasticity plays an important role
in the jet adjacent to the cone apex, where significant stretching
of the polymer chains is evident26 due to the convergent flow
and a high degree of chain orientation is developing. After the
jet velocity is stable, the elongational strain rate becomes small
enough that Newtonian-fluid flow is applicable and the inertial
term is dominant.
On addition extreme amount of TEBAC salts (0.05 wt %)
into the 23 vol % PS/DMF solution, the solution conductivity
increased significantly from 0.2 íS/cm to 49 íS/cm but others
properties (viscosity and surface tension) remained relatively
unchanged. For this more conductive solution, similar trends
of the Q dependence of the cone height and jet length were
observed, i.e., larger cone volume with shorter jet for increasing
Q.37 At a given Q, however, the enhanced conductivity leads
to the cone/jet morphologies having a larger cone and shorter
jet, as shown in Figure 5, in comparison with the solution
without salts. It is of significance to note the reduction of jet
diameter to produce a jet velocity as high as 10 m/s, suggesting
a higher elongational strain rate for the more conductive solution.
For four different PS solutions with various properties, Figure
6 shows the Q dependence of the measured dj (open symbols)
and the as-spun fiber diameter, df (filled symbols). We found
that both dj and df increased with Q and followed a power law
model, i.e., dj  Q0.48 and df  Q0.25 for the PS/DMF solution,
dj  Q0.66 and df  Q0.27 for the PS/DMF/TEBAC solution, dj
 Q0.44 and df  Q0.23 for the PS/THF/LiClO4 solution, dj 
Q0.49 for the PS/o-DCB/Bu4NClO4 solution. The exponent for
the dj-Q relation is in accordance with the theoretical consid-
erations: dj  Q1/2 derived by Can˜a´n-Calvo,36 whereas a larger
exponent (dj  Q2/3) has been proposed by Fridrikh et al.38 based
on a simple assumption of df ) 0.5dj, which may not be valid
since different exponents for the Q dependence of the dj and df
are obtained experimentally as shown in Figure 6. Experimen-
tally, hence, we found that there is a scaling law between dj (or
df) and Q, and the exponent for dj is ca. two times larger than
that for df.

For the PS/DMF 23 vol % solutions, the diameter of the
collected membrane (spinning area) remains constant regardless
of the Q used but the fiber birefringence is found to decrease
slightly with increasing Q (Figure 8). When the solution
conductivity is enhanced by adding the salts, both the membrane
diameter and birefringence of the as-spun fibers are increased,
indicating the spinning effectiveness associated with the electric
repulsive forces. It should be noted that the fiber birefringence
obtained by electrospinning is equivalent to that for melt-spun
PS fibers at a drawdown ratio40 of ca. 200. The Herman’s
orientation factor of the electrospun PS fibers is estimated to
be 0.067 by assuming the intrinsic birefringence of PS being
-0.15.41
3.3. Effects of Applied Voltages (V). Increasing applied
voltage at a given H and Q, the cone height (or volume) was
gradually reduced but the jet length was increased. Ultimately,
the contracted cone interacted with the needle surface at a
sufficiently high voltage and interruption of the stable cone-jet
spinning mode occurred. The voltage range available for stable
cone-jet mode was rather limited; i.e., Vus/Vs was generally
smaller than 2.0 as shown in Figure 1. Typical results of the
voltage effects are displayed in Table 2, showing that the
voltages required for the stable cone-jet mode were in the range
of 9-12 and 9.5-12.5 kV for the PS/THF/LiClO4 and PS/DMF/
TEBAC solutions, respectively. As the applied voltage was
increased, both the jet diameter and fiber diameter were slightly
reduced but the effect was not pronounced in some systems
when their standard deviations were taken into account. In
contrast, the fiber birefringence was increased with increasing
V, indicating a better chain orientation developed within the
electrospun fibers. This finding was not unexpected because
one might propose that a larger V should lead to a greater charge
density on the jet surface, induce a stronger repulsive force,
and result in a smaller dj. As shown in Figure 9, in fact, PS/
DMF solutions show the expected trends and the V dependence
of dj can be scaled as: dj  V-0.57, indicating a stronger
dependence of dj on the applied voltage in comparison with
the Q effect. For the PS/THF/LiClO4 solution, however, the
exponent was negative but very small, ca. -0.04, indicating
the insignificant dependence of dj and df on the voltage applied.
One should be also aware of the plausible error in determining
the power law exponent in consideration of the limited voltage
range (9-12 kV, Figure 9) available for the regressions.
Nevertheless, similar dj-V scaling laws with negative sign of
approximate exponents have also been obtained in other polymer
systems, such as the poly-3-hydroxybutyrtae/CF and PAN/DMF
solutions, and the details will be given in a separate article. On
the basis of our results, we conclude that the applied voltage
shows a negative effect on dj, which in turn exhibits a similar
effect on df as shown in Figure 9. Our results are different from
the previous findings by Demir et al.18 and Fennessey et al.21
on electrospinning polyurethane fibers and PAN fibers, respec-
tively. They reported that jet diameter at a constant distance
from the cone apex appeared to increase as the voltage was
increased. However, one should be aware that the jet diameter
is distance dependence as shown in Figure 4 and the jet length
varies with the applied voltage (Table 2), leading to the necessity
to determine the precise location of jet end in order to obtain
more reliable dj. In addition, the jet end fluctuates for certain
distance owing to the incipient of asymmetric instability.
It is rationalized that significant drawing of jet takes place
in the bending instability region, simultaneously resulting in
the rapid evaporation of solvent due to the increasing surface
area of the whipping jets. Jet drawing becomes infeasible when
the jet viscosity increases to a certain level at which the electric
repulsive forces is incapable (in vain) to pull the solidified fiber
any longer. On the basis of the assumption of volume conserva-
tion, we further assumed that the terminal jet with a diameter
of dj was drawn to a specific draw ratio and then the solvent
was subsequently evaporated to produce a dry fiber with a
diameter of df during bending instability Therefore, the draw
ratio associated with the bending instability was estimated to
be: lf/lj  (dj/df)2, where lf and lj were the phantom lengths
of the fiber and jet, respectively and their ratio was termed the
drawability of the whipping jet. The larger the drawability of
the jet possesses, the higher level of chain orientation is
expected. As shown in Table 2, good correlation between the
calculated drawability and the fiber birefringence measured is
obtained under the condition of voltage changes. Hence, when
the PS solutions are electrospun at a higher voltage, thinner PS
fibers with larger birefringence are obtained due to the presence
of larger repulsive forces in the bending jet which exhibits a
stronger drawing (larger lf/lj).
3.4. Effects of Working Distance (H). Due to the point-to-
plate configuration for our electrospinning setup, nonuniform
electric field was expected and the apparent applied electric field
was tentatively expressed by the V/H ratio. By varying H at
fixed V and Q, the H effect on the cone/jet/fiber dimensions
was discussed. For allowing solvent evaporation during jet
whipping, H should be sufficiently larger than the jet length,
otherwise the liquid jet will touch down the ground collector
and/or wet fibers are obtained. A typical plot of the measured
jet diameter along the jet length is given in Figure 10, where a
23 vol % PS/DMF solution with 0.01 wt % TEBAC is tested.
Increasing the working distance led to a shorter jet and a longer
Taylor cone with a profile from being concave to convex. The
typical H dependence of the measured cone/jet/fiber dimensions
is given in Table 3. Both dj and df were slightly increased (or
relatively unchanged in consideration of the standard deviations)
although H had been approximately doubled. These findings
suggested that it was the applied V rather than the V/H, which
played a dominant influence on the jet and fiber diameters during

related to the intrinsic viscosity [Ł] through the equation: c*
 2.5[Ł]. For PS, the crossover from the semidulte to
concentrated regime occurs for c greater than 0.1 g/cm3. The
viscoelastic properties in the dilute and semidilute solutions (
< 0.1) are dependent upon the solvent used due to differences
in the chain expansion factor, whereas that the molecular weight
between entanglements (Me) is insensitive to solvent power. For
sufficiently high polymer concentrations ( > 0.1), the effect
of solvent quality becomes negligible and the scaling of the
molecular weight between entanglements with concentration is
well established as:(Me)sol  18700c-1, where 18700 is the
Me in the PS melt. On the other hand, for highly entangled PS
in the semidilute regime ( < 0.1) different scaling rule for the
concentration dependence of Me is derived and expressed to
be: (Me)sol  10200c-1.3.45 It should be noted that different
scaling laws are applied for the concentration dependence of
Me in different regimes. On the basis of the assumption that
the critical molecular weight for entanglement Mc is ca. two
times of Me, the boundary between the entangled and nonen-
tangled regimes, i.e., the locus of c vs M, was determined and
given in Figure 13 (thick solid lines) for monodisperse PS used.
Moreover, it should be noted that the transition in Figure 13 is
likely to be relatively gradual due to the broad MWD of samples
used in this study. Conceptually, electrospinning will be
degenerated into electrospraying when the solution character-
istics falls in the regimes of I, II, and IV, where chain
entanglement is absent. Similar considerations but different
expressions have been proposed by McKee et al.13 and Shenoy
et al.15 in discussing other electrospinning solutions.
The applicability of Figure 13 is found to be rather useful in
predicting the electrospun features of PS with a given MW.
For examples, the MW of PS that we used is ca. 300K; varying
solution concentration from low to high (as shown by the arrows
in Figure 13) essentially alters the morphology of the electrospun
product from spherical particles (points a and b, 1-6 vol %),
beaded fibers (points c-e, 13-19 vol %) finally to smooth fibers
(point f, 23 vol %). Our results are in accord with previous
findings13,15 who claimed smooth fibers without any beads are
obtained at a concentration higher than 1.75c. Hence, Figure
13 provides a convenient guideline to determine the minimum
concentration to produce smooth PS fibers at a given PS MW.
For examples, a solution with a volume fraction of 0.03 is
sufficient for PS with a MW of 1880K to prepare electrospun
fibers with fiber structure, a volume fraction higher than 0.37
is required for the PS with a MW of 100K, whereas fiber
structure is never observed for the PS with a MW of 4K in all
the concentrations prepared.
3.7. Effects of Solvents. It is expected that solvent properties
play an important role in determining the spinnability of polymer
solutions.12,46 It seems to us that the solvent possessing high
volatility, high conductivity (or dielectric constant) and good
solvent characteristic of the polymer is the most desirable one.
For all the solvents that we used, the solvent affinity to the PS
chains is on the order of THF  CF > o-DCB > DMF as shown
in Table 1, where solubility parameters are given. Moreover,
both THF and CF are more volatile than DMF and o-DCB. The
conductivity of DMF solvent is the highest among them.
Although o-DCB was a relatively good solvent compared with
DMF, no smooth fibers but spherical particles were obtained
for PS/o-DCB solutions with concentrations even up to 29 vol
%, where sufficiently high entanglement density was already
reached according to Figure 13. Using the high speed camera,
the breakup of electrified jets into droplets of different sizes
(similar to Figure 3b) was discernible despite the presence of
stable cone-jet mode during electrospinning. The failure to
obtain fiber structure was ascribed to the extremely low
conductivity (10-5 íS/cm) and high boiling temperature of the
o-DCB solvent. By adding small amount of TEBAC salts, the
spinnability of PS/o-DCB became feasible and smooth PS fibers
were able to prepare under appropriate processing conditions.
On the other hand, PS/DMF solutions could be readily elec-
trospun due to the high conductivity characteristics. In com-
parison with the spinnability of these two solutions, it seems
that solution conductivity outweighs the polymer-solvent
affinity.
Although the processing time is quite small (1ms), solvent
evaporation might be enhanced when a high volatile solution
is delivered from the needle tip to the jet end, where the polymer
concentration might be increased. Thus, it is the solution just
prior the bending instability, not necessarily the solution in the
needle, should possess sufficient entanglement density in order
to obtain smooth spun fibers. During the chaotic jet whipping,
a significant increase of entanglement density associated with
the pronounced solvent evaporation is for certain. Using THF
(or CF) as a solvent, PS concentration less than 13 vol %
produced merely droplets (diameter  10 ( 2 ím for 6 vol %
and 12 ( 2 ím for 12 vol %), 14 vol % solution gave the trace
presence of fibers, and finally up to 18 vol % solution generated
ribbon-shaped PS fibers having a diameter of 12 ( 6 ím with
porous surface. However, the width of PS ribbons was not
uniform and “beaded-ribbon” structure was seen, the large knots
being 33 ím wide and separated by a distance of ca. 6 ím.
Numerous elongated pores (750 nm long and 300 nm wide)
along the PS fibers were observed on the surface. The presence
of pores is attributed to the interaction of THF (or CF) with
moisture during jet whipping, and the pore size is related with
the humidity.21,22 By adding 0.05 wt % LiClO4 salts into 18
vol % PS/THF solutions, the solution conductivity was en-
hanced, leading to the facts that the jet length was significantly
reduced and the as-prepared fibers were smooth and thin (2.5
( 0.7 ím) with reduced pore diameter (60-100 nm). Similar
transitions from beaded to smooth fibers were also reported in
the literature.9,11,16,39 The disappearance of beaded fibers might
be attributed to the significant migration of the soluble salts to
the jet surface under the strong electric field, which in turn
produces a core/shell regime within the electrified jet. Thus,
phase separation takes place, giving the presence of “polymer-
rich” and “polymer-poor” phases in the core and shell fluids,

viscoelastic regimes for PS in DMF solvent. Several regimes for various
chain conformations can be identified: (I) dilute, (II) semidilute and
not entangled, (III) semidiluted and entangled, (IV) concentrated and
not entangled, and (V) concentrated and entangled.
