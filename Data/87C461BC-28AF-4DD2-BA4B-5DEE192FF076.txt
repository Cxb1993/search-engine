Abstract?The objective of this project is to
study the electrical and optical
characteristics of organic materials which
exhibit the ambipolar carrier transport
capability for improving efficiency and
elongating lifetime of organic light emitting
device (OLEDs). In this project, we propose
several technologies to achieve these goals,
such as:
?1? improvement of the current
efficiency without the tradeoff of the
driving voltage and lifetime by
engineering the emitting layer (EML)
materials, mixing ratios, dopant
materials (including fluorescent and
phosphorescent), concentrations,
doping profiles, and insertion of
hole- and electron-blocking

(HTL) material and tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) as the electron transport layer (ETL) material. 
The ambipolar EML was a mixture of NPB and Alq3 with different mixed-ratios. Fig. 1(a) shows the 
experimental and simulated J-V characteristics. The driving voltage increased and then decreased with increasing 
the NPB concentration. Raising NPB concentration leaded to the enhanced hole-current and reduced electron-
current. The hole-current enhancement did not compensate the electron-current decline when the HTL ratio 
increased from 0 to 25%. The sequential increase of HTL material concentration from 25 to 100% resulted in the 
voltage reduction on account of rapidly boost of hole-current.  
Besides, we inserted a very thin 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-tert-butyl-6-1,1,7,7- tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-
pyran (DCJTB) layer (1.2 nm) with 2 vol. % in different positions of the EML layer (NPB:Alq3=1:1) to detect 
the distribution of the recombination-rate. In Fig. 2, we show that the relative intensity of probe/matrix at 2.5 
mA/cm2 and the driving voltage at 100 mA/cm2 as a function of the probe positions. The curve of driving voltage 
versus probe position is almost the inverse of that of intensity ratio. The position of the maximum red/green ratio 
and the minimum driving voltage are 10 nm from the HTL/EML interface. This phenomenon is attributed to the 
higher recombination rate of the high-quantum-yield red dopant than that of the matrix, and thus driving voltage 
decreases due to the increase of the recombination current. By doping a yellow dopant in the blue matrix, a white 
OLED with CIE coordinates at (0.34, 0.354) was fabricated. The driving voltage reduction of 2 V, compared to 
the control blue device was observed and it achieves 7.7 cd/A and 6.2 lm/W at 4V.

3. Summary: Recombination zone distributions in an ambipolar EML were quantitatively investigated. The thin 
probe in the ambiploar EML increases the recombination current and reduces the driving voltage. A white OLED 
with low driving voltage was fabricated by selectively doping yellow emitters in the blue matrix.

thermal evaporation at a vacuum chamber with the base pressure of 5*10-6 torr.  
3. Results and discussion 
In our experiment, we inserted an ultra-thin DCJTB layer in the EML and measure the electroluminescence (EL) 
spectra of green and red emission from the matrix and dopant materials, respectively. If the dopant is near the 
maximum recombination-rate position, the intensity ratio of red-to-green component will show an obvious 
increase. By examining the evolution of spectra from various probe positions, the spatial recombination-rate can 
be obtained. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the recombination peak locates at 10 nm away from the HTL/EML interface 
(device B) before aging [2]. After stressing the OLED with 200 mA/cm2 DC for 48 hours, the red/green ratio of 
the EL spectra decrease (increases) for the device B (C), respectively, shown in Fig. 1(b). For device A, the shape 
of the EL spectra is typically identical. Due to the strong degradation of red peak for device B, the recombination 
peak shift to the HTL/EML interface. And we can deduce that the recombination zone becomes broader after 
current stressing. Fig. 1(c) shows the differences before and after the current stressing, we can clearly see that the 
organic material degrades at the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù recombination peak which provides the evidence that higher carrier 
densities results in higher recombination rate, thus more serious degradation [4]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Conclusions 
In summary, we provide a methodology to study the degradation characteristics in a MH-OLED by inserting a 
red probe in the EML. The variation of the red/green emission shows the recombination rate changes under the

recombination zone broaden.

Through the modulation of grating pitch, certain orders would be coupled into surface plasma resonance between 
the interfaces of gold and dielectrics. Fig. 1 shows the optical intensity from different viewing angles. We can see 
that the light emission came from certain angles, i.e. -10 to -25 degrees, which was determined by the grating 
structure. Although a 13 nm Au was deposited upon the organic materials, strong light emission was still 
observed due to the SPR coupling which was efficient to improve the external quantum efficiency. Here, the 
observation angle was defined as zero degree at the normal direction of the substrate and a negative value toward 
the incident light direction.

Photoluminance (PL) spectra at different viewing angles are shown in Fig. 2. We can see that the spectra 
have an obvious blue shift with increasing the observation angle which can be directly obtained from the grating 
equations. We can also see that the emission covers the whole visible range due to the broadband emission 
characteristics. 
 
4. Summary 
We have shown PL response of the broadband organic emitter on the corrugated surface. The strong light 
emission comes from the SPR coupling and the broadband emission of the two-layer structure. Such a device has 
the potential to improve the extraction efficiency of an OLED and for bio-sensor applications.

the device structures of Figs. 1 (a) and 1(b),

ambient intensity increases. On the other hand, the A-
CR of the RLCD keeps at ~133.8:1, insensitive to the 
ambient light intensities for both device 
configurations. The A-CR in Fig. 2(b) is improved for 
both T- and (R+T)-modes since the TOLED is placed 
upon the polarizer of the RLCD which decreases the 
optical loss and increases the transmission of the T-

Abstract
A simulation method has been purposed in this paper 
to optimize the stack structure of metal/ITO cathode for 
full transparent or top emission devices. The result 
demonstrates that the complexity of the two proper 
layers thicknesses design is reduced. Finally, the 
experiment data also strain the simulation result. 
1. Objectives and Background 
Full transparent or top-emitting PLEDs attract great 
interesting due to its application for helmet-mounted 
display or integration with silicon-based driver display. 
To get high efficiency full transparent or top-emitting 
PLEDs, cathode design is one of key issue. Carrier 
balance and light output-coupling have to be considered 
at the same time. Typically, thermal deposited thin 
semi-transparent metal as cathode is used to satisfy this 
requirement, but transmittance is dramatic decreasing as 
the metal thickness increasing. Therefore, many group 
reported using transparent conduct oxide (TCO) stacked 
with a thin metal as a cathode for full transparent and 
top-emitting devices [1]. In this paper we study the 
PLEDs performance using TCO stacked with an ultra-
thin metal (1, 3, 5 nm) which is enough to resist the 
sputtering damage and has very high transmittance > 85. 
The ultra-thin Ag, Au, and Al metal were chosen for 
their optical property analysis [2]. Difference metal 
thickness from 1 to 20nm and changing indium tin oxide 
(ITO) thickness which serves as capping layer for 
optical property are simulated to understand how the 
thickness variations influence the optical performance. 
The trend of simulation results are consistence of our 
experimental results. 
2. Experiment 
The experiment has been done for comparing with the 
result of simulation, we prepared top emission PLEDs. 
Polymer layers were deposited by spin coater onto a 
glass substrate coated with a patterned indium-tin-oxide 
(ITO) electrode. A hole injection layer PEDOT:PSS was 
spin coated onto ITO glass substrate and baked in 
atmosphere at 120–∫ for 15min. Next, the active 
luminescent polymer film PFO was spin coated onto 
PEDOT:PSS layer, and baked in glove box at 120–∫ for 
30 min. Thereafter, the samples were transferred into 
thermal evaporation chamber that evaporated Ag 
interlayer (1nm). Then, the ITO cathode was deposited 
by dc-sputtering 50 W at room temperature (~ 120 nm). 
Then the reference device passivated with glass lid that 
a thin UV-curable resin was applied from a syringe 
around the edge of the glass adhesively and exposed to 
UV light 120 seconds. Measurements were carried out 
at room temperature under atmosphere. 
2. Results and discussion 
Fig. 1 shows simulated electroluminescence (EL) 
intensities of devices (metal 3 nm/ITO 120 nm) with 
different metals of silver (Ag), gold (Au), and aluminum 
(Al). The device with silver film shows better optical 
performance than that of the other two devices. From 
Fig. 2, the transmittance data (the transmittance of Ag 
and Au is very similar) of different metal seem simply 
consistent with the result of Fig. 1. From this result, the 
silver film is thought to be the better choice for the 
ultra-thin metal film than the other metals when only the 
optical property is considered. Therefore, the optimum 
thickness of Ag and ITO were analyzed in Fig. 3. The 
ITO thickness is fixed at 120 nm, and the Ag 
thicknesses are changed from 0 to 20 nm. The EL 
intensity is slightly decreased in the range of 1~5 nm-
thick, and sharply drop as the silver film is thicker than 
10 nm. This result implies that the proper thickness of 
the Ag film is around 1~5 nm.

can note the spectral redshifts and intensity decreases 
with increasing the module temperature. The slope of 
peak wavelength shift for RGB LEDs is 3.93nm, 
0.93nm and 1.22nm per 30oC and the intensity decay 
rate is 17.95%, 5.17% and 6.39% per 30oC linearly

3. Results and discussion 
The color performance of LCD with tri-chromatic 
LEDs can simulated with CIE 1931 xyY color system. 
Spectrum of S(O), emitted from display, can be 
calculated with the tristimulus power distribution X(O),
Y(O), and Z(O) to yield three scalar values X, Y, and Z 
values which determine x and y value. Color gamut of 
display can be calculated from x y of RGB images 
individually as follow equation:

With slightly shifting emission wavelengths (+/-5 
nm), it is reasonable to assume the temperature 
dependences on optical intensity and spectral shift are 
identical to the measurement results as shown in Fig. 
3 since the emission wavelength of LEDs can be 
easily tuned by slightly changing the composition and 
layer thicknesses while the temperature dependence is 
not so sensitive to the two parameters, but to the 
material systems.  
Fig.4 shows the simulation results with different 
LED peak wavelengths shown in Table I. Case 1, 2 
and 3 are in the order of LEDs peak wavelength from 
shortest to longest. We can see that case2 has the 
maximum color gamut 102% and minimum variation 
3% over module temperature range from -20 to 100oC.
With rising temperature, case3 has the decreasing 
trend of color gamut and its maximum peak 
102%NTSC happens at 10oC. That means the extra 
expensive cost of heat sink to make this module 
temperature cool down to 10oC, otherwise the color 
performance of display is getting worse with rising 
temperature. Case 1 has an increasing trend, and its

Fig. 6 shows the relation between color gamut and 
color temperature of the whole LCD system with 
sample#1 operated at RT. Briefly, no intensity decay 
and spectrum shifting functions should be considered 
in this condition due to their operational module 
temperatures were set at RT. The increasing color 
gamut could be observed clearly when the color 
temperature raises from 5000K to 11000K, and the 
saturated color gamut could be obtained more than CT 
11000K. 
The rising CT from 6500K to 9000K would increase 
color gamut of LCD system without thermal optical 
characteristics of RGB-LEDs. Nevertheless, this 
evidence could not be observed at Fig. 5(a) since 
intensity decay and spectral shift of RGB-LEDs 
dominate the color gamut variation of LCD 
system, which exceeded the increasing color 
gamut from rising CT.

4. Summary
We have demonstrated a design rule for a high 
color gamut LCD with pre-compensated tri-chromatic 
LED backlight without spending extra cost in 
expensive solutions of heatsink and a complicate 
feedback circuit. By choosing the RGB-LED chips 
with the peak wavelength of the LEDs pre-blueshifted, 
the NTSC value increases then decreases slightly and 
its value is always higher than 100% within the range 
of 25 to 70 oC.

sample: Au (40nm)/Alq3(80nm)/Si substrate. 
 
Electrical and optical characteristics of 
OLED was performed by using a Keithley 
2400 source meter for current-voltage 
measurement and a Minolta CS-1000 
photometer for the brightness measurement. 
We also set up a reflectivity measurement 
system to measure the angular dependent 
photoluminescence (PL) of the surface 
plasmon coupled emission spectra 
produced by designated grating. All the 
experiments were performed at room 
temperature. Incident light with the 
wavelength of 405 nm from a white light 
source (Newport Oriel Spectral Luminator 
69050) illuminates the sample through a 
polarization filter at fixed incident angle (»ôi) 
of 45¬∞. The sample was kept at a fixed 
azimuthal angle (ƒ≥) of 0¬∞ incidence to 
pumping the organic molecules to excite 
metal grating and cross coupler produce 
SP-coupled emission. The emission beam 
is collected through a 2-inch lens with focal 
distance of 5cm on a spectrometer 
(USB2000-VIS-NIR, Ocean Optics Co.) or a 
CCD camera (HAMAMATSU C2400). The 
spectrometer moved to measure the SP-
coupled emission intensity at different 
emission angles (»ôe) in response to the 
measured optical signal change in SPPs as 
well as the surface refractive index of the 
SPPs-grating. This emission is grating-
scattered re-radiation from Alq3-excited 
SPPs modes rather than direct radiation 
from Alq3 molecules. 
 
 
Results and discussions 
Fig. 2 shows the photoluminescence (PL) of 
the planar and corrugated sample with the 
thin films Au (40nm)/Alq3(80nm). We can 
see that for the planar sample, the PL 
intensity has a Lambertian-like distribution. 
On the other hand, the PL intensity from the 
corrugated OLED is much improved by four 
times at zero degree and can be observed 
only within 10o. One has to note that there 
is Au layer on the top of Alq3 which 
impedes parts of light emission from the 
organic layers. However, in the corrugated 
sample, the strong PL signal reveals the 
SPR coupling exists at the interfaces which 
improves the extraction efficiency of the 
sample.

Fig. 2 PL intensities at different viewing 
angles with planar and corrugated samples.  
 
Besides, we also measured the spectra at 
different viewing angles. For the planar 
sample, there is no obvious spectral shift 
with different viewing angles. On the other 
hand, the corrugated sample changes color 
even with a small viewing angle difference. 
Fig. 3 shows the pictures at different 
viewing conditions of the corrugated sample. 
We can see that the color shifts from the 
red to blue within the viewing angles of only 
20o. Such a highly sensitive characteristic 
may have a potential application for bio-
sensor.
