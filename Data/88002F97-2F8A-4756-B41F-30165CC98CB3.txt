Introduction
Transport phenomena in microchannels have received enormous attention recently due to
emerging demands in a number of microfluidic systems for chemical and biological analysis
[1-3]. Fluid delivery is crucial in the microfluidic systems because of the small size of these
devices, and hence the pumping method needed for microdevices is quite different from that of
macroscale devices. To meet the pumping requirements of these microdevices, various
techniques have been proposed for fluid pumping, such as electrostatic [4], piezoelectric [5],
electrodrohydrodynamic [6], magnetohydrodynamic [7], and electroosmotic [8-10] pumping.
Among them the electroosmotic micropump has been favored due to its many advantages over
other types of micropumps. including. Electroosmotic pumps need no moving parts and have
much simpler design and easer fabrication. It is applicable to of a wide range of conductivity of
fluids, which is essential for biomedical applications. Also, precise flow control can be
achieved easily by controlling external electric field.
Electroosmosis is the bulk movement of liquid relative to a stationary charged by an applied
electric field, and was first discovered by F.F. Reuss in 1809 from a experimental stuty on porous
clay diaphragrams. The physicis of this unique mechanism has been described in detail in the
literature, e.g. Probstein [11]. The electroosmotic flow (EOF) velocity profile depends on the
ratio of the Debye length to the characteristic length of the microchannel, where the Debye length
chariterizes the thichness of the electric double layer (EDL). When the Debye length is much
smaller than the channel length scale, the velocity profile is nearly uniform (chariterised by slug
flow). On the other hand, the Debye length is of the same order as the channel characteristic
length, the the velocity profile is practically like that of classical pressure driven flow. In recent
years, electroosmotic flow has been used extensively in microdevices to move packets of fluid
without dispersion. Many applications involve either chemical separation, heterogeneous or
homogeneous chemical reactions, and/or heating/cooling cycles.
So far, relatively little attention has been paid on the thermal behavior associated with
electroosmotic flow. Analytical solutions for fully developed electroosmotic flow in circular
and parallel plate configurations were presented by Maynes and Webb [12, 13]. They
considered the effects of Joule heating and viscous dissipation and indicated that Nusselt number
depends on the relative duct radius and the volumetric source. They also reported that viscous
dissipation effect is only important at low values of the relative duct radius, and thus concluded
that the influence of viscous dissipation is negligible for most practical electro-osmotic flow
applications. In the present work, we carry out an analysis for convection heat transfer of
electroosmotic flow in a microchannel subject to uniform wall temperature (UWT) or a uniform
surface heat flux (UHF). The governing system of equations consists of the electric potential
field, flow field, and energy equations. First, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved to
obtain the electrical potential distribution, which in turn gives the net electric charge density, and
subsequently the body force due to an external electric field is determined. Next, the flow
equation with an electrokinetic body force is solved to obtain an analytical expression for the
velocity profile of a fully developed flow. Finally, the associated thermal transport problem is
solved for the temperature distribution, and thus for the Nusselt number. An analytical expression

Solution method
It is noted that 1 would represents a microchannel, while it may be the case for a
nanochannel if ~ O 1 . For the UHF case, analytical solutions are obtained as described in
the previous Section. For the UWT case, the first eigenvelue will be obtaineded analytically by
the method of matched asymptotic expansions for<< 1, but it should be calculated numerically
for finite. When<< 1, the velocity distribution becomes

The outer expansion Y() is valid for < 1, i.e. away from the wall. If the boundary
condition at = 1 were (incorrectly) applied to the outer solution, the eigenvalue would simply
be  2 1 2n  . The inner expansion XY~ is valid for the neighborhood of = 1, i.e. close
to the wall. The asymptotic matching condition between the two can be considered as providing
an “efective” boundary condition for the outer solution, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The
detailed analysis and Eq. (44) show that the discrepancy between the two expansions is of the
order of3 due to the thin EDL.
For electroosmotic flow with finite, the corresponding eigenvalue problem is

Results and discussion
Figure 2 illustrates typical electric potential distribution at selected values of . The
potential distribution decreases from its maximum close to the wall (charaterized by the zeta
potential) to zero in the core region. Representative velocity profiles are shown in Fig. 3 for
several values of . Small values of occur when the Debye length occupies a very small
portion of the channel cross-section. Accordingly, the velosity profiles display slug-like
behavior with a very thin boundary layer at the wall. On the other hand, large values of of 
arise when the Debye length is of the same order as the microchannel half-height. Thus, the
case ~ O 1 may be representative of electroosmotic flow in nanochannels.
Under the constant surface temperature condition, Table 1 lists some results for the first
eigenvalue at selected values of the ratio , with a comparison to the approximations obtained
from equation (44). The results are also ploted in Fig. 4 for up to a value of 0.3. It is
observed that the dependence onis only a few percent in any case, i.e. asymptotic results for1
are accurate over a range of (within a tolerance of 1% for 0.2 but 5% for = 0.3). To
increase is found to slightly increase the first eigenvalue. Thus, we may expect that the thin
EDL gives only small effects to heat transfer due to an increase in . Figure 5 shows the
variations of Um and Nu vs. for electroosmotic flow under the UWT condition. It is
obvious that the Nusselt number decreases with , and hence the effect of EDL is to reduce the
heat transfer. Also note that = 0 corresponds to the classical case (slug flow) with the
solution 2Nu [14].
The dimensionless temperature distributions for the UHF case are illustrated in Fig. 6 for
different values ofand G. It is clear that an increase in the ratioleads to greater variation
inover the channel cross-section. The dependence of temperature diminishes with
