Introduction 
Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) are essential accessories to complement the 
deficiencies of batteries or fuel cells because of their high power rate and long cycling 
life. An electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) is an EC that employs high porosity 
carbons to store electrical energy via electrostatic interactions between the charges across 
the electrode/electrolyte interface.1-16 High porosity is the essential characteristic of 
carbons with large specific capacitance. However, this same characteristic limits the 
transport of both the electrolyte ions and electrons in the electrode framework.17-20 
Mesophase pitch, which consists of parallel-stacked lamellar macromolecules and has a 
dense structure, has drawn attention as a raw material for high-density isotropic 
graphite.21-24 The specific structural features of mesophase pitch also facilitate its 
activation into porous carbon of extremely high specific surface area.11,12,25-30 The pores 
created in the lamellar carbon structure have been reported to be favorable for 
high-capacitance double-layer formation.31,32 This renders mesophase pitch-derived 
carbon an ideal material for EDLCs. However, the charge transport issue must still be 
resolved for operation at high power.  
 For activation to take place, mesophase pitch and KOH are heated together at high 
temperatures (> 700 °C). Pore development in the pitch-derived carbon is associated with 
the formation of potassium−graphite intercalation compounds and with the direct attack 
of molten KOH on the basal planes of the microcrystalline structure formed during 
heating.32-36 In the former route, removal of the potassium metal by water or HCl solution 
from the potassium−graphite intercalation compounds creates slit-like micropores that 
contribute a great proportion of specific surface area of the resulting carbon.33 In the latter, 
molten KOH penetrates perpendicularly into the microcrystalline layers, creating 
wedge-like pores with a wide (mesoporous) entrance zone and a narrow (microporous) 
bottom.32 The inside of the wedge-like pores has a structure consisting primarily of 
4 
solution containing 4.5 g of KOH and 60 g of water. The flask was immersed in a 
constant temperature shaker bath, with a shaker speed of 100 rpm. The mixing was 
performed at 85 °C and lasted for 3 h.11 
After mixing, we subjected the pitch−KOH slurry to vacuum-drying at 110 °C for 24 
h. The dried samples were then heated at 800 °C for 1 h in a horizontal cylindrical 
furnace purged with N2. The KOH-etched product was washed by stirring in 250 mL of a 
0.5 M HCl solution at 85 °C for 30 min. The acid-washed sample was then leached by 
mixing with 250 mL of distilled water at 85 °C several times until the pH value of the 
water−carbon mixture was above 6, to yield the porous aMP. Prior to any 
characterizations or electrochemical measurements, all the carbon samples were heated in 
a helium atmosphere at 900 ºC to remove surface oxides, which are known to 
significantly reduce the electronic conductivity of carbon electrodes.  
The prepared aMP was ball-milled to submicron size to improve ion 
transportation. The milling procedure was carried out at a rotation speed of 240 rpm for 
12 h in a planetary-type ball-mill (Retsch PM100, Germany). A 50 mL tungsten carbide 
grinding bowl and 2 mm stainless-steel balls were used, with a ball-to-carbon weight 
ratio of 40:1. Ethanol was poured into the grinding bowl as the milling medium, to 
prevent agglomeration during milling. We designate the milled aMP as aMP-m. A 
mixture of aMP and 2−30 wt% of multi-walled CNTs (Aldrich, France; 10−15 nm in 
diameter and 1−10 µm in length) was milled using the procedure described above to 
obtain the composite specimen. The particle size distribution of the milled aMP-m 
specimen was determined by lazer light scattering using a Zetasizer particle size analyzer 
(Malven, UK). The electrical conductivity of the carbon materials was measured with a 
four-point probe (Jandel RM3-AR, UK). Measurement specimens were made by casting 
carbon on a glass substrate with 5 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder to form 0.2 
mm carbon films. 
The microstructures of the aMP specimens were examined with transmission 
6 
the symmetric cells between 0 and 1 V with a current density range of 0.125−100 A g−1.  
 
 
Results and Discussion 
Characterization of the electrode materials 
Fig. 1a shows the TEM image of the 3000 °C-treated mesophase pitch that 
consisted of microcrystallites with an inter-layer spacing of 0.34 nm. The ordered 
structure reflects the graphitizable feature of the mesophase pitch. Fig. 1b shows the TEM 
image of the porous aMP specimen derived from KOH activation of the mesophase pitch 
at 800 ºC. The aMP exhibits a disordered structure distributed with inter-connected 
nanochannels. These nanochannels were formed by the disordered packing of turbostratic 
graphene sheets and clusters.46 The high concentration of nanochannels reflects the high 
porosity of aMP. This indicates that K+ intercalation into the lamellar structure of 
mesophase pitch and KOH etching on the basal planes of the microcrystallites are 
effective in pore creation. 
Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the aMP, aMP-m, and a 5 wt% CNT/aMP 
composite, and allows comparison of the external structure of these carbons. We will 
show later that 5 wt% CNT addition gives the optimum capacitive performance for the 
CNTs/aMP composites, and the 5 wt% CNTs/aMP composite is designated as aMP-mt 
thereafter. The aMP specimen is made up of spherical particles with a mean size of 
approximately 30 µm (Fig. 2a). After ball-milling to pulverize the aMP particles, the 
resulting aMP-m (Fig. 2b) exhibits as unregulated fragments with the particle size 
ranging below 900 nm (Fig. 2d). The image of aMP-mt (Fig. 2c) shows that CNTs are 
sparsely dispersed, without any tangling, in the interstices of the pulverized carbon 
8 
insets of Fig. 3), may result from K+ ion intercalation into the lamellar structure of 
mesophase pitch. The K+ ions may also etch and perforate the graphene sheets.26 These 
micropores are slit-shaped between graphene sheets. On the other hand, the KOH attack 
on the basal plane of heat-treated mesophase pitch creates wedge-like channels (Fig. 4), 
in which the narrow bottom region corresponds to the larger micropores (> 1 nm) and the 
near-entrance region to the mesopores. The wedge-like channels can facilitate electrolyte 
ion transport to the interior of the carbon particles, thus enhancing both the energy and 
power densities of the resulting carbon electrodes. A recent study produced high surface 
area carbon (SBET = 3100 m2g-1) from KOH activation of graphene at 800 ºC for high 
energy density supercapacitors.49 This 800 ºC-activated graphene should have 
sheet-stacking configuration analogous to that in Fig. 4.  
 
Evaluation of the electrode charge storage capability 
Potential scan cyclic voltammetric analysis provides the basic charge storage 
information of an electrode. Fig. 5 shows the cyclic voltammograms of symmetric 
two-electrode cells assembled with the aMP, aMP-m, and aMP-mt samples at various 
rates. The voltammograms at a relatively lower scan rate of 50 mV s-1 were nearly 
rectangular, which is characteristic of an ideal capacitor. With an increase in the potential 
scan rate, the charge transportation resistance becomes a dominant force in distorting the 
rectangular shape of the aMP cell voltammogram (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, the 
voltammograms of the aMP-m and aMP-mt cells (Fig. 5 (b and c)), aMP-mt in particular, 
retained a rectangular shape even for a scan rate of 1000 mV s-1. The results evidently 
show that both the milling and CNT addition treatments improve the charge 
10 
resulted from the aggregation of a proportion of the milled particles and therefore the 
hindrance of electrolyte gaining access to these particles. The extent of aggregation 
would not be high because this capacitance-lowering was minor. With CNT addition to 
segregate the particles and create inter-particle channels, aMP-mt shows a capacitance 
value even greater than that of aMP, indicating that the combination of milling and CNT 
addition promotes the surface accessibility of micropores. Fig. 4 demonstrates a 
schematic of the aMP-mt composite framework that consists of milled high-porosity aMP 
particles inserted with CNTs. Note that the mass of additive CNTs, which have much 
smaller specific surface area, was included in the specific capacitance calculation.  
Fig. 6 shows a decreasing trend of capacitance with discharge current, reflecting 
that the charge transport resistance correlates negatively with the charge storage process. 
At a considerably large discharge current of 12.5 A g-1, for example, the specific 
capacitance of the aMP and aMP-m electrodes are 230 and 240 F g−1, respectively. The 
capacitance value of aMP-m becomes greater than that of aMP at an elevated discharge 
rate. This indicates that particle milling reduces resistance to diffusion of electrolytes into 
the interior of the milled particles without aggregation. With a further increase in the 
discharge rate, the superior charge storage of aMP-m over aMP storage becomes 
increasingly obvious. This is in line with the results of the cyclic voltammetric analysis 
shown in Fig. 5. Because of the reduced size of the aMP-m particles, the electrolyte 
diffused over a shorter path to reach the particle interior, resulting in more efficient 
charge storage at high operating currents. Fig. 6 also shows that aMP-mt is evidently 
superior to both aMP and aMP-m at elevated discharge rates. This simply demonstrates 
the importance of particle segregation with CNTs in manifesting the advantages of 
12 
capacitive performance, as the full-scale spectra exhibit only the vertical-lines feature. 
The inset of Fig. 8 shows the magnified high-frequency region of the impedance spectra 
for the cells. The equivalent series resistance (Res) i.e., the intercept at the Re(Z) axis) 
was 0.19 Ω (8 kHz), 0.17 Ω (2 kHz), and 0.16 Ω (2 kHz) for the aMP, aMP-m, and 
aMP-mt cells, respectively. Because the capacitive response was fast for these cells, these 
Res values were obtained at frequencies larger than 1 kHz. The “standard” Res measured 
at 1 kHz was also obtained for comparison, and yielded values of 0.21, 0.17, and 0.16 Ω 
for aMP, aMP-m, and aMP-mt, respectively.3,45 The Res comprises the electrical 
resistance associated mainly with the contacts and the ionic resistance associated mainly 
with the ion migration across the cell separator. Because the cells had the same 
electrolyte and separator, the variation of Res indicates that both the size reduction and 
CNT bridging increase the electron percolation of the carbon films by increasing the 
electrical contact points. We have confirmed this by measuring the conductivity of the 
carbon powders (0.2 mm) casted on a glass substrate with 5 wt% PTFE binder. The 
conductivities are 0.49, 1.9, 2.1 S cm-1 for the aMP, aMP-m, and aMP-mt casts, 
respectively. 
The inset of Fig. 8 shows the presence of a transitional Warburg region at high 
frequencies before the plot becomes a vertical line. The Warburg region is a consequence 
of the distributed resistance/capacitance in a porous electrode.18,55,56 The Warburg region 
shown in the inset of Fig. 8 is attributable to ion migration in the carbon films that are 
composed of packed carbon particles. The equivalent distributed resistance (Red) for the 
Warburg region can be estimated by extrapolating the low frequency straight line to 
intersect the Re(Z) axis. The intercept value equals the sum of Res and Red. The Red 
14 
and Z is the overall capacitance of the capacitor cells. This presentation format is useful 
for visualizing the capacitive charging process at low frequencies. We obtained the data 
in the capacitance complex plane by incorporating Eq. (2) with the impedance data in Fig. 
8. The Re(C) value of Fig. 9 corresponds to the in-phase response of a capacitor element 
to potential variation, while the Im(C) value is the out-of-phase response of a resistance 
element. The magnitude of the overall capacitance is (Re2(C) + Im2(C))1/2. 
For uniform charge diffusion patterns, a typical ac capacitance response is 
characterized by a semicircle feature in the complex plane. Fig. 9 shows that both the 
aMP-m and aMP-mt cells exhibit one semicircle feature, while the capacitive response of 
the aMP cell consists of two semicircles, the high- and low-frequency semicircles. The 
result of the aMP cell indicates that two different charge diffusion modes account for the 
overall charge storage mechanism in the aMP electrode. The complex plane of the 
capacitive response (Fig. 9) makes it possible to estimate the average relaxation time (τ) 
for charge storage in the electrode: τ = (2πfmax)−1, where fmax is the frequency at the 
maximum −Im(C) observed in the capacitance complex plane.66 The high- and 
low-frequency semicircles of the aMP electrode  may correspond to the bulk and 
hindered charge diffusion modes, respectively.18 The values of the bulk and hindered 
capacitive relaxation times are 36 and 720 ms, respectively. At the low frequency limit 
the aMP cell had a smaller Re(C) value relative to those for aMP-m and aMP-mt, 
reflecting the hindered charge diffusion. After milling to reduce the particle size, the 
aMP-m cell showed only the bulk capacitive response with a relaxation time of 36 ms, 
which is identical to the bulk capacitive relaxation time of aMP. This result implies that 
the hindered capacitive response observed for aMP resulted mainly from ionic migration 
16 
where P is the power density, E is the specific energy, I the applied constant current, V 
the potential window (=1V), M the total mass of two symmetric electrodes, and td the 
time for complete discharge. Fig. 11 summarizes the P and E results in the Ragone plots, 
showing that the cell performance is improved by particle-milling and addition of CNTs. 
All the cells reach a specific energy of 9 Wh kg−1 or larger at a power density of 1,000 W 
kg-1. The specific energy decreases with the power density, and particle-milling and 
addition of CNTs preserve the specific energy. The specific energies are 6.8, 7.5, and 8.2 
Wh kg-1 for the aMP, aMP-m, and aMP-mt cells at a high power density of 10,000 W kg-1. 
The performance of the aMP-mt cell is outstanding for applications within a small 
potential window of 1 V.  
To confirm the stability of the capacitance with cycling, the aMP-mt cell was 
charged and discharged between 0 and 1 V at 12.5 A g−1 for 10,000 cycles. Fig. 12 shows 
the variation of capacitance with cycle number. Instead of capacitance decay, the cell 
demonstrates a gradual capacitance increase with cycling in the entire measurement 
process. The improved wetting of the pores may have caused this capacitance increase 
with continuous charge-discharge. The high cycling stability justifies the repeatability of 
the double layer formation mechanism. This electrode design strategy (using the milled 
high-porosity aMP particles inserted with high-conductivity CNTs) is very promising for 
obtaining high energy and power densities in double-layer charge storage.

double-layer charge storage. We believe that using an organic electrolyte to extend the 
potential window could further enhance the energy and power performance of symmetric 
EDLCs assembled with the aMP-mt electrode.

Abstract 
Graphite oxide (GO) is the intermediate state between graphene and graphite,1 and 
easily exfoliates and disperses in aqueous solution like wrinkled-paper because the 
oxygen functionalities are hydrophilic. Fully oxidized GO is an insulator, in contrast 
to low-oxidation GO and graphene that are electrically conductive,2 and can serve as 
electrochemical capacitor (EC) electrodes. Chemical reduction with hydrazine is used 
for GO reduction, but this is unfavorable in practice due to environmental concerns. 
Our previous study found that mutual photocatalytic reduction between GO sheets 
occurred when a GO suspension was irradiated with UV.3 The degree of reduction, 
and thus the electrical conductivity of GO, varied with the degree of irradiation.

Graphite oxide (GO) photocatalysts were derived from graphite 
oxidation. Absorption spectroscopy shows the increasing band gap 
of GO with the oxygen content. Electrochemical analysis along 
with the Mott-Schottky equation show that the conduction and 
valence band edge levels of GO from appropriate oxidation are 
suitable for both the reduction and oxidation of water. The 
photocatalytic activity of GO specimens with various oxygen 
contents was measured in methanol and AgNO3 solutions for H2 
and O2 evolution, respectively. The H2 evolution was strong and 
stable over time whereas the O2 evolution was negligibly small due 
to mutual photocatalytic reduction of the GO with upward shift of 
the valence band edge under illumination. The conduction band 
edge of GO showed negligibly change with the oxygen content. 
When NaIO3 was used as a sacrificial reagent to suppress the 
mutual reduction mechanism under illumination, strong O2 
evolution was observed over the GO specimens. The present study 
demonstrates that chemical modification can easily modify the 
electronic properties of GO for specific photosynthetic applications. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Hydrogen generation from water decomposition under light irradiation has received 
much attention.1–7 Photolysis of water using semiconducting photocatalyst powders is 
considered a prospective candidate because of the low cost in instrumentation and high 
interfacial contact area for reaction.8–17 The essential requirements for an effective 
semiconducting photocatalyst are more negative conduction band edge and more positive 
valence band edge, to facilitate respectively reduction and oxidation of water. 
Additionally, the contact area between the catalyst and water should be large enough to 
execute photochemical reactions at sufficiently high gas-evolution rates. Most 
photocatalysts are metal-containing inorganic solids for H2 and/or O2 evolution from 
water.18–28 High temperature calcination of these metal-containing photocatalysts is 
generally conducted for high crystallinity,29 but it shrinks the contacting surface area with 
water. Molecule-like materials with accurate electronic band structure, high surface area, 
and stability are an alternative to the crystalline solid.19-21,30,31 Graphite oxide (GO) is a 
polymer-like material made of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, having a large exposable 
surface area after being dispersed in water to molecular scale.32 We demonstrated that

electrode, were placed vertically and immersed in the GO suspension 1 cm apart. The 
deposition process was conducted using constant voltage at room temperature. To 
increase the film thickness without crack formation, we used a multilayer deposition, 
consisting of five repetitive depositions at 10 V for 60 s with intermediate drying at room 
temperature. We subjected the GO electrodes from electrophoretic deposition to air-
drying at room temperature for 24 h. 
The Fermi level potential and donor density of the GO electrodes were analyzed by 
impedance spectroscopy using an impedance spectrum analyzer (Zahner IM6e, Germany) 
equipped with Thales software. In the present work, the measurements were performed 
by applying a sinusoidal potential perturbation with a small amplitude (10 mV), 
superimposed on a fixed dc potential varying within a potential window from 0 to 1 V (vs. 
Ag/AgCl) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) with a Pt foil as the counter 
electrode. We used a linear potential scan in the same electrochemical system to 
determine the conduction band edge of the GO electrodes. The measurement was 
conducted by scanning the electrode potential from 0.4 to −1.2 V at 5 mV/s. 
Photocatalytic reactions were conducted at approximately 25 °C in a gas-closed inner 
irradiation system. The light source was a 450 W high-pressure mercury-lamp (UM452, 
Ushio, Japan). A jacket between the mercury lamp and the reaction chamber was filled 
with flowing temperature-controlled cooling water. For measurements with visible-light 
irradiation, a temperature-controlled NaNO2 aqueous solution (1 M) was flowed through 
the jacket to filter the UV light (λ < 400 nm). The GO photocatalysts (0.5 g) were 
suspended in the reaction chamber containing 1100 mL of methanol solution (20 vol %) 
for H2 evolution or AgNO3 solution (0.01 M) for O2 evolution tests. The amounts of 
evolved H2 and O2 were determined using gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 7890, 
USA; molecular sieve 5A column, thermal conductivity detector, argon carrier gas). The 
Ag nanoparticles deposited on the GO surface after the O2 evolution tests were analyzed 
with TEM (Hitachi H-7500, Japan). In addition to the AgNO3 solution,59 we used an 
NaIO3 solution (0.1 M), in which IO3− ions served as an electron scavenger,60 to measure 
the photocatalytic activity of GO for O2 evolution. 
 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pristine graphite (PG), 
mGO, and hGO. The sharp (002) peaks of PG, mGO, and hGO near 26.3, 10.2 and 9.0° 
indicate interlayer distances of 0.34, 0.86, and 0.98 nm. Oxidation on graphite 
significantly expands the interlayer spacing between graphene sheets, leading to the 
disappearance of the 26.3° peak and emergence of peaks with 2θ < 10°. The hGO 
specimen exhibited a larger interlayer spacing than mGO did. This reflects that greater 
accommodation of oxygen species for hGO retained a larger amount of water molecules 
and led to a larger distance between the two graphene sheets. The variation in the 
interlayer distance confirms that the population of oxygen functionalities on graphene 
sheets increased with the duration for oxidation. 
Figure 2a shows the optical absorption spectra of the GO specimens. The absorption 
edges for mGO and hGO were located at approximately 550 and 460 nm (that is, 2.3 and 
2.7 eV), respectively. The blue-shift with the prolonged oxidation indicates that the 
oxygen functionalities reduced the symmetry of the π−π* system to open the gap and

shown in Figure 5, the conduction band levels of the GO photocatalysts are high enough 
for water reduction to produce H2. The hGO specimen had a lower activity in H2 
generation than mGO did. The larger band gap of hGO may lead to a lower degree of 
light absorption and thus a lower activity. A co-catalyst, serving as an electron trap, is 
generally required to assist water reduction for H2 production.60,65-67 Platinum is generally 
used as a co-catalyst for H2 generation.68-70 Auxiliary experiments showed that in situ 
photodeposition of Pt did not promote the H2 evolution rate for either catalyst.33 This 
indicates that photo-induced charges in molecule-like GO catalysts can easily access the 
catalyst−liquid interface to react with the species in the liquid phase. The inset of Figure 
6a shows the evolution of H2 from the methanol solution containing the mGO specimen 
under visible-light irradiation. The H2 evolution rate was stable, but much lower than 
those with mercury-lamp irradiation were. Obviously, a great proportion of the GO 
molecules is not visible-light active in terms of water reduction. 
Figure 6b shows the evolution of O2 from the silver nitrate solution over hGO, 
whereas the evolution of O2 over mGO was not detectable. The band energy diagram in 
Figure 5 indicated that the valence band edges of both mGO and hGO are low enough for 
water oxidation. The low activity of mGO in O2 production may be associated with the 
reduction of GO with light irradiation and the corresponding narrowing of the band gap.33 
This reduction effect must have resulted in changes in the electronic structure of GO. 
During photocatalytic reaction, we observed color change and aggregation of GO sheets 
due to GO reduction.33 We therefore subjected the GO specimens with 6 h irradiation in 
the methanol solution (that is, irr-GO) to analysis with optical absorption and 
electrochemical spectroscopy. 
Figure 7a shows absorption onsets at ca. 830 and 690 nm (that is, 1.5 and 1.8 eV) for 
irr-mGO and irr-hGO, respectively. The converted spectra in Figure 7 (b and c) show that 
the irradiation reduced the direct transition gap to 1.7−2.8 and 2.4−3.6 eV for irr-mGO 
and irr-hGO, respectively, and the indirect gap to 1.5−2.0 and 1.8−2.2 eV. Figure 8 
shows the capacitance values of the irr-GO film electrodes obtained with the 
electrochemical impedance analysis at varying applied potentials in a Mott-Schottky plot. 
The Fermi levels of irr-GO specimens, corresponding to the intercepts on abscissa, are 
indicated in the figure. The data of Figures 3 and 8 show that the Fermi levels of GO 
exhibit a strong negative shift because of the reduction from irradiation. Figure 9 shows 
the linear potential scan results for the irr-GO electrodes. The scan measurements 
provided both irr-GO specimens a conduction band edge of −0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), 
representing an insignificant positive shift relative to that of the GO specimens. By 
incorporating the results from the optical and electrochemical measurements, we 
constructed the band energy diagrams for the irr-GO specimens, as shown in Figure 5. 
The diagrams show that the conduction band of the irr-GO specimens remained high 
enough for H2 evolution. This explains why the H2 evolution rate remained stable during 
the entire period of light irradiation (Figure 6a). By contrast, the conduction band edge of 
irr-mGO lies above the potential level for O2 evolution, in agreement with the 
observation that no O2 evolved from the AgNO3 solution during irradiation. Regarding 
irr-hGO, the valence band edge is only marginally more positive than the water oxidation 
level. This explains why O2 evolution over hGO was detected (Figure 6b), but the amount 
was much smaller than that of H2 evolution. 
Figure 10 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of irr-hGO that 
was irradiated in the AgNO3 solution. Ag nanoparticles, which were identified with 
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of 2−10 nm, are dispersed on the GO sheets. This 
indicates that the reduced Ag atoms serve as the electron traps to reduce surrounding Ag+

dispersion to suppress mutual reduction. The electronic and photocatalytic analysis of GO 
demonstrated that GO has a tunable feature for its properties and can serve as effective 
media for photosynthetic reactions including water decomposition.
