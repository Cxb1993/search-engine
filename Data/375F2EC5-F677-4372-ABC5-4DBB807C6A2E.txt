ensembled microstructural information of bulk-metallic-glass-matrix composites using synchrotron X-ray diffraction”, 
Applied Physics Letter, 97 (17), 171910. 
重要發現結果摘要: 
The microstructural characterization of the Zr60.0Ti14.7Nb5.3Cu5.6Ni4.4Be10.0 bulk-metallicglass-matrix 
composites is investigated using high-energy synchrotron x-ray diffraction. The convoluted 
diffraction-intensity distribution in the azimuthal direction is naturally yielded from the spatial arrangements 
of the crystalline dendrites and their amorphous matrix. We facilitate the area selection and the intensity 
integration of the diffraction collected from a two-dimensional detector to characterize the diffraction 
intensity of the amorphous matrix. The results enable us to apply the modified Williamson–Hall plots for 
using the peak width to study the microstrain and micromechanism of the deformation of the crystalline 
phase.

pp. 3-10. 
重要發現結果摘要: 
Neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffractions were used to study the texture development in the face 
centered-cubic nickel-based superalloy over gauge volumes ranging from hundreds of cubic millimeters down 
to sub-cubic micrometers. The bulk averaged results find a uniform texture development from collective slip. 
However, X-ray microbeam studies at microscale find that the plastic deformation within a single grain is 
mediated by limited slip, as evidenced by the local strain distribution. Polychromatic microdiffraction shows 
the formation of several distinct structural zones even in the same grain. A hierarchical heterogeneous 
geometrically-necessary dislocations arrangement and distinct slip bands are observed within each grain. A 
depth-dependent change of the stereographic projection within the slip band in the grain is demonstrated. 
Correlated oscillations of the lattice orientation at the submicron scale evolve into an overall texture at the 
macroscale.

tensile strain of 15.5% at room temperature. The present BMGMC exhibits the largest tensile ductility and 
highest fracture absorption energy under the stress–strain curve of all dendrite-reinforced BMGMCs 
developed to date. Tensile deformation micromechanisms are explored through experimental visualization

Monitoring and Characterization of the Fatigue Response of Nano-
Crystalline Mg Composites Reinforced with Ti2AlC: Antonios Kontsos1; 
Kavan Hazeli1; Babak Anasori1; Theodoros Loutas2; Michel Barsoum1; 
1Drexel University; 2University of Patras
     Herein we report on the mechanical and fatigue properties of nano-
crystalline Mg-matrix composites reinforced with a Ti2AlC powder, 
fabricated by pressureless spontaneous melt infiltration of porous 
Ti2AlC preforms. Careful monotonic and cyclic tensile and compression 
experiments, combined with continuous acoustic emission (AE) monitoring 
are used to obtain vital information pertinent to the initiation and evolution 
of deformation and damage mechanisms related to this composite. The 
fatigue response is shown to be excellent over an extended period of time 
during which the recorded and extracted AE features are noticeably different 
from the initial and final stages of fatigue life. These results combined with 
the observed high damping are consistent with, and can be explained by 
invoking the formation and annihilation of incipient kink bands. The latter 
are fully reversible dislocation-based defects consisted of parallel coaxial 
dislocations formed on easy slip planes of kinking non-linear elastic solids 
such as Ti2AlC and Mg.

Effects of Ultrasonic Nanocrystal Surface Modification on Fatigue 
Behavior of SUS316 Austenitic Stainless Steel Tube for Stents: Auezhan 
Amanov1; Young Sik Pyun1; Jun Hyong Kim1; Hak Du Kim1; Sang Ho Kim2; 
Chae Jong Park2;  1Sun Moon University; 2M.I. Tech Co., Ltd.
     The present paper describes the effect of Ultrasonic Nanocrystal Surface 
Modification (UNSM) treatment on fatigue behavior of SUS316 austenitic 
stainless steel tube for stents which is inserted into clogged heart, superficial 
femoral, carotid, and renal arteries. The surface hardness, surface integrity 
and compressive residual stress were compared before and after UNSM 
treatment. The fatigue test under room temperature is under carrying out and 
their results will be compared before and after UNSM treatment also. In 
addition, the possibility of replacement the expensive Co-Cr alloy tube by 
the UNSM treated SUS316 tube will be analyzed.

Increasing the Fatigue Life of SAE52100 Steel by Ultrasonic Nanocrystal 
Surface Modification: Jong Soon Im1; Young Sik Pyun2; Auezhan Amanov2; 
Sung Jae Lee1; Jun Hyong Kim2; Chang Min Suh3;  1ILJIN GLOBAL; 2Sun 
Moon University; 3Kyungpook National University
     To increase the fatigue strength of slim bearing rings, the Ultrasonic 
Nanocrystal Surface Modification (UNSM) treatment was applied to rotary 
bending fatigue test specimens which are made of bearing steel SAE52100. 
XRD analysis shows that the structure of subsurface layer has become a nano-
grain structure till 100 µm depth from the top surface. Surface structure and 
nano grain refinement were analyzed and compared before and after UNSM 
treatment by EBSD analyses as well as fatigue crack growth behavior of 
UNSM-treated specimens was compared with that of original specimens 
which had not been UNSM-treated. It was also revealed from the surface 
analyses that surface hardness was increased by 20% and compressive 
residual stress was also induced up to 900 MPa of the UNSM-treated surface 
which are the main phenomena in prolonging fatigue life of bearings. RCF 
and friction characteristics after UNSM treatment were also explained.

Research on HCF Tests and Damage Model of TC11 Alloy Welded 
Joints: Xiaogang Liu1; Guo Hai-ding1;  1Nuaa
     In the paper, the loading controlled fatigue tests of TC11 alloy welded 
joints have been done; the micro characteristics of fatigue fracture surface 
have been studied by SEM (scan electron microscope) as well. According to 
the test results, two types of fatigue source on fracture surface of the welds 
are found, say, edge fatigue source and internal fatigue source. Then S-N 
curve of the two types are obtained respectively. The fatigue life of the edge 
fatigue source is 35-65% longer then that of the internal fatigue source. 
Moreover, based on the gray distribution of the fracture surface’s SEM 
imagines, the fractal dimension of fatigue source rejoin on fracture surface 
has been calculated by box counting method, the relationship between fractal 
dimension and fatigue life is analyzed. Finally, a fractal damage model which 
concern macro and micro damage is established based on the combination of 
damage mechanics theory and fractal theory.

Residual Stresses in Alloy CF8C Plus Coated with Iron Aluminide: 
Deepak Kumar1; Sebastien Dryepondt1; Philip Maziasz1; Bruce Pint1; Beth 
Armstrong1; Edgar Curzio1;  1Oak Ridge National Laboratory
     CF8C plus is an economic, cast austenitic stainless steel that has creep 
resistance comparable to state-of-the-art wrought stainless steel and Ni-
base alloy, such as alloy 617, but does not require any post processing heat 
treatments. In this paper we discuss the evolution of residual stresses when 
this alloy is coated with aluminide coatings applied by slurry-coating and 
pack cementation processes with the objective of improving its oxidation 
resistance.  The near surface and bulk residual stresses during heating/
cooling of the coated samples were determined by x-ray and neutron 
diffraction techniques for temperatures up to 900C. Conventional tension-
compression strain-controlled fatigue experiments were conducted on the 
bare and coated samples to assess the effect of residual stresses on the fatigue 
strength.

Fatigue Behavior of Al 6082-T4 and Al 7075-T73 after Ball Burnishing: 
Yasser Ahmed1; Mansour Mhaede2; Lothar Wagner2;  1German University 
in Cairo; 2Institute of Materials Science and Engineering (IWW), TU of 
Clausthal
     The effect of ball burnishing on the rotating beam fatigue strength of 
age-hardened 6082-T4 and 7075-T73 aluminum has been investigated. 
Deep rolled specimens were cyclically deformed at room temperature using 
push-pull stress controlled fatigue and compared to the electrically polished 
condition as a reference, Also Shot peened condition give better results 
compared to electrically polish. Optimization curve was produced for both 
SP and BB conditions, due to this optimization shot peened with Almen 
intensity of 0.2 mmA for both alloys was used. For ball burnishing (deep 
rolling) 40 bars was used for 6082-T4 and 75 bars for 7075-T73 by deep 
rolling tool HG13.  The observed improvements were from about 45% for Al 
6082-T4 while it was the double for Al 7075-T73 compared to electrically 
polish, while the improvement of fatigue for BB condition compared to SP 
was 5% for Al 6082-T4 and 28 % for Al 7075-T73. Data analysis shows 
that the fatigue behavior in these alloys affected by surface treatment. It was 
found that deep rolling can dramatically enhance the fatigue behavior of 
aluminum alloys as compared to the shot peening and polished condition 
due to near surface compressive residual stresses as well as work hardening 
states and increased hardness induced by mechanical surface treatment (deep 
rolling).

3D Orientation Imaging Microscopy Based on Monochromatic Beam 
Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction and Imaging Techniques: Wolfgang 
Ludwig1; Andrew King2; Peter Reischig3; Michael Herbig1; Henry Proudhon4; 
1Université de Lyon; 2ESRF; 3Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; 4Mines 
Paristech
     3D X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) is a methodology, which combines 
the principles of X-ray diffraction imaging (topography) and image 
reconstruction from projections (tomography) for investigation of 
polycrystalline materials. We present a new acquisition strategy aiming at 
the reconstruction of local orientation and elastic strain distribution via a 
combination of full-field imaging and micro-beam diffraction techniques. 
Associating this 3D orientation mapping with conventional attenuation 
and/or phase contrast tomography yields a non-destructive characterization 
technique, enabling time-lapse observation of crystal growth, deformation 
and damage mechanisms in the bulk of structural materials. The capabilities 
and limitations, as well as perspectives of this combined characterization 
approach will be discussed and illustrated on selected application examples.

Measuring Complete Strain Tensors from Individual Dislocation Cells 
in Deformed Cu: Lyle Levine1; Peter Geantil2; Bennett Larson3; Jonathan 
Tischler3; Francesca Tavazza1; Michael Kassner4; Wenjun Liu5;  1National 
Institute of Standards and Technology; 2University of Southern California; 
3Oak Ridge National Laboratory; 4Director of Research, Office of Naval 
Research; 5Argonne National Laboratory
     The use of depth resolved, sub-micrometer X-ray beams for studying 
dislocation structures in plastically deformed metals has advanced 
considerably over the past five years.  Thus, we previously measured elastic 
strains (and thus stresses) from individual cell interiors and cell walls in 
plastically deformed Cu specimens and compared these results with model 
calculations.  However, these measurements included just a single component 
(e11) of the elastic strain tensor, since only a single X-ray reflection could be 
examined with the necessary accuracy.  Recently, additional detectors were 
installed to allow multiple reflections to be measured over a wide range of 
angles, enabling us to measure both the crystallographic orientation and 
the complete elastic strain tensor (and thus the stress tensor) from spatially 
resolved, sub-micrometer sample volumes within deformed metal specimens. 
The first results of these experiments will be presented along with model-
based simulations of the stress tensor in cell walls and cell interiors.

Synchrotron X-Ray Laue Microdiffraction for the Study of Materials 
Micromechanics: Nobumichi Tamura1; Martin Kunz1; Kai Chen1; 
1Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
     Laue X-ray microdiffraction is a powerful tool which allows mapping 
crystal orientation and elastic strains in 2D and 3D at the mesoscopic scale 
(0.1 - 10 µm). Small displacements of the reflection positions with respect to 
their calculated “unstrained” positions allows determining the deformation 
of the unit cell and thus the elastic strain (in effect the deviatoric component 
of the elastic strain). Plastic deformation on the other hand manifest itself 
as broadening of the Laue reflections. Symmetric broadening is linked to 
statistically stored dislocations (SSD) but asymetric broadening in the 
form of peak streaking can be explained in term of geometrically necessary 
dislocations (GND) causing local bending of the lattice. Examples of 
the application of x-ray microdiffraction to the study of deformation in 
polycrystalline thin films and single crystal nanopillars will be given.

A Study of Casting Residual Stress: Thomas Watkins1; Eric Johnson2; 
Camden Hubbard1; Joshua Schmidlin1;  1ORNL; 2Deere and Company
     Stringent regulatory requirements, such as Tier IV norms, have pushed the 
cast iron for automotive applications to its limit. As such, castings need to 
be designed with closer tolerances by incorporating hitherto unknowns, such 
as residual stresses. In the present work, a benchmark study was undertaken 
for casting residual stress measurements through neutron diffraction, which 
was subsequently used to validate the accuracy of a simulation prediction. 
Castings of lattice specimen geometry were made such that adequate residual 
compressive and tensile stresses were generated during solidification, 
without any cracks. The residual stresses in the cast specimen were measured 
using neutron diffraction. Simulations were performed using the identical 
geometry and casting condition for predictions of residual stresses. The 
simulation predictions were found to agree well with the experimentally 
measured residual stresses.

Laue Microdiffraction Measure of Crystal Distortion and Dislocation 
Density Profile in a Plastically Deformed Multi-Crystal: Gael Daveau1; 
Benoit Devincre2; Thierry Hoc3; Odile Robach4;  1LEM (CNRS-ONERA) 
/ MSSMAT (ECP); 2LEM (CNRS-ONERA); 3LTDS (EC-Lyon); 4CEA-
Grenoble DSM/INAC/SP2M/NRS
     In this study, a dislocation density based model [1] initially developed 
for fcc single crystal is extended to strain hardening in polycrystal. For 
this reason, the early stages of plastic deformation in a Cu tri-crystal are 
investigated with Laue microdiffraction. Measures are made in the vicinity 
of a triple node after approximately 0.5% of compression. The existence of 
extended rotation and strain gradients at the grain boundaries (GBs) is shown. 
Peak broadening analysis provides qualitative and quantitative evolutions 
of the GNDs density distribution during deformation. The GB impact on 
strain hardening is thus clearly revealed. Those results are compared with 
simulations of dislocation dynamics that calculate the reduction of dislocation 
mean free path imposed by GBs. This information serves as an input to a 
crystal plasticity code reproducing the tri-crystal plastic deformation. [1]

Pair Distribution Function of a High Entropy Alloy: A Neutron 
Scattering Study: Wei Guo1; Peter Liaw1; Takeshi Egami1;  1university of 
tennessee, knoxville
     A ZrNbHf high entropy alloy is prepared. Laboratory X-ray diffraction 
indicates the lattice structure is body center cubic. Since this material is 
composed of different elements with various dimensions and valances, 
it is compelling to study the local structure of the alloy to unveil how the 
atoms construct this structure. Samples deformed at different strains and 
as-cast samples with no deformation are investigated by neutron scattering 
with high-intensity powder diffractometer. Pair distribution functions of the 
samples are obtained and compared. The local structural features of the high 
entropy alloy are discussed, and the deformation mechanism is suggested.

Cyclic-loading Effects on Lattice-Strain Asymmetry Behavior in 
Loading and Transverse Directions: E-Wen Huang1; Kyle Woods2; Bjorn 
Clausen3; Rozaliya Barabash4; Peter Liaw2;  1National Central University; 
2Univ. of Tennessee; 3Los Alamos Neutron Science Center; 4Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory
     Cyclic loading and the subsequent fatigue-induced structural transformations 
have been investigated using in-situ neutron-diffraction experiments at 
elevated temperatures. In-situ neutron-diffraction measurements identify the 
development of different fatigue stages in the cyclic-deformation-induced 
structural transformations, such as bulk hardening, softening, and eventual 
saturation. A transition is observed during the saturation cycles, which is 
characterized by the emergence of the lattice-strain asymmetry in the loading 
and transverse directions. An anomaly during saturation cycles is believed to 
arise from dislocation self-organization – possibly during the formation of 
microcracks. The single-phase, polycrystalline nickel-based alloy is selected 
for the present study of the loading and transverse asymmetry subjected to 
cyclic loading at both room and high temperatures. In this investigation, we 
compare the deformation at room and elevated temperatures. The identical 
loading and transverse -asymmetry feature is found to be valid at both room 
and high temperatures.
