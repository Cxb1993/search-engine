natural frequencies of a single tapered and pretwisted turbo-blade were calculated by Rao [11,12], 
Hodges et al. [13], Abrate [14] and Dawson et al. [15,16] calculated the natural frequencies of a single 
tapered and pretwisted turbo-blade using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Gupa and Rao [17] used the finite 
element method to find frequencies of natural vibration of doubly tapered and twisted beams. 
Swaminathan and Rao [18] identified the vibrations of a rotating, pre-twisted and tapered blade. 
Subrathmanyam et al. [19,20] identified the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a uniform pre-twisted 
cantilever blade using the Reissner method. Chen and Keer [21] evaluated the transverse vibrations of a 
rotating pre-twisted Timoshenko beam under axial loading. Wagner [22] calculated the forced vibration 
response of subsystems with various natural frequencies and forms of damping, attached to a foundation 
of finite stiffness and mass. Griffin et al. [23,24,25] determined the dynamic responses of frictionally 
damped turbine blades. Determining the dynamic features of wind turbine blades is of great importance. 
In this work, the spline collocation method and the differential quadrature approach are utilized to 
formulate an eigenvalue problem in matrix form for wind turbine blades.  
 
MAXIMUM POWER OF WIND GENERATORS 
Analog measurements of currents, shift torques, voltages, stresses and rotational speeds are passed 
through multi-channel analog to digital circuit. The measured data are stored digitally in a computer. The 
shaft torque is measured using a strain gauge transducer. The wind generator has three wind composite 
blades. The wind mechanical power w
P
 is given by 
w wl wl m

where wl
C
 is the wind energy loss constant; 
J
 is the turbine moment of inertia; 
ω
 is the turbine 
angular speed and m
P
 is the turbine mechanical power. The turbine mechanical power m
P
 is given by   
m ml eP T C Pω ω= = +  (2) 
where 
T
 is the torque, and ml
C
 is the mechanical energy loss constant. The wind turbine generator

where a
ρ
 is the air density; p
C
 is the rotor efficiency of the turbine; w
v

r

radius of the wind turbine. The air density depends on the pressure and temperature of the air. Figure 1 
plots the output voltages of the wind generator. Figure 2 plots the output current of the wind generator. 
Figure 3 plots the output power of the wind generator. Figure 4 plots the output voltage of the AC/DC 
converter. Figure 5 plots the output voltage of the DC/DC converter. Figure 6 plots the output current of 
the DC/DC converter. Figure 7 plots the output voltage of the DC/AC converter. Figure 8 plots the 
measured power from the wind generator at various wind speeds. The results revel that the wind blade 
speed significantly affects the measured output power. The speed of the wind blade speed must be 
maintained to maximize power. Figure 9 plots the measured energy losses of the wind generator for 
various wind speeds. The results demonstrate that the speed of the wind blade substantially affects the 
energy losses. The energy loss depends on the rate of the rotation of the wind generator. Figure 10 plots 
the measured power coefficient p

affects the measured value of the power coefficient p
C

In the differential quadrature method, equation (34) can be substituted into equations (58)-(67). The 
equations of motion for the wind turbine blades can be rearranged into a matrix form. Figure 18 plots the 
calculated frequencies of the wind turbine blades, obtained using the differential quadrature procedure 
applied to various sample points. The material properties and geometric dimensions of the wind turbine 
blades are given by 
.E 9 4 GPa=
, 
5 50r = . cm , 
.L 52 5 cm=
 and 
/ 31550 kg mρ =
. Computational 
results demonstrate that the differential quadrature technique is highly accuracy, even when 14 sample 
points are applied to determine the first frequency. Computational results also suggest that the differential 
quadrature approach is highly accurate when 19 sample points are used to determine the second 
frequency and when 22 sample points are used to determine the third frequency. Numerical results 
calculated using the proposed differential quadrature formulation are satisfactorily accuracy, and the 
accuracy of the solution is extremely sensitive to the number of sample points. Figure 19 plots the 
calculated frequencies of the wind turbine blades, determined using the differential quadrature approach 
and finite element method. The curve obtained using the differential quadrature method closely follows 
the curve obtained using the finite element method. Figure 20 plots the effects of the rates of rotation on 
the calculated frequencies of the wind turbine blades. The computational results demonstrate that the first 
frequency of the wind turbine blade depends strongly on speed of the blade. The frequencies of the wind 
turbine blade increase with the rate of rotation. The numerical results in this investigation suggest that 
rate of rotation speed does not markedly affect the second and third frequencies of the wind blades. 
Figure 21 plots the frequencies of the wind turbine blade at various pitch angles, θ . Numerical results 
demonstrate that the pitch angle θ  does not significantly affect on the first, second, and third 
frequencies of the wind turbine blade.
