and infrared photodetector of double barriers 
superlattice. 
 
Multi-color infrared photodetector for operation at 
high temperature and low bias was realized by a 
superlattice sandwiched by double barriers with 
quantum wells (MQWs) are inserted in the right side 
of them. The BLIP temperature is about 100K and the 
photoresponse is 12mA/W at 110K under 0.3V. The 
associated detectivity is 2*109 cm Hz0.5/W at110K and 
8.4&micro；m under 0.3V.The photoresponse under 20-
80K is switchable between 8.4&micro；m and 10&micro；
m by the magnitude of applied bias.In addition, our 
detector exhibits little temperature dependence of 
photoresponse at high temperature. This device is the 
promising candidate of a pixel in the focal plane 
array. 
 
  A double-barrier superlattice infrared 
photodetector (SLIP) that contains a superlattice 
sandwiched by the thin and thick barriers has been 
developed. Photoelectrons can bounce back and forth 
between the two barriers and inject through the thin 
barrier to enhance the photocurrent. In comparison 
with the single-barrier SLIP, this structure shows at 
least one-order higher magnitude of photocurrent at 
low bias and the associated 80 K detectivity is also 
increased for more than one order. This detector also 
shows high-temperature operation above 100 K with an 
appropriate detectivity at low bias (1.1×109 cm 
Hz1/2/W at 0.17 V). A simple photoelectron resonance 
model is given to analyze the resonance phenomenon. 
 
  We have further designed and studied a superlattice 
infrared photodetector (SLIP) which has a 
superlattice (SL) sandwiched between front (thin) and 
rear (thick) barriers. Photo-excited electrons in 
second miniband can oscillate between two barriers 
and punch through the thin barrier to contribute to 
the higher photocurrent. However, the supply of 
electrons is limited by the thick barrier and thus we 
need to fabricate the emitter contact on the SL. The

Experimental 
The sample layers from bottom to top are an emitter layer, a 500 nm Al0.33Ga0.67As thick blocking barrier, a 
15-period SL, a graded barrier AlxGa1-xAs ,a 30-period MQW and a collector layer. 
The sample was grown by molecular-beam-epitaxy deposition on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate. The 
sample layers from bottom to top are an emitter layer, a 500 nm Al0.33Ga0.67As thick blocking barrier, a 
15-period SL, a graded barrier AlxGa1-xAs(X=0.29-0.21), a 30-period MQW and a collector layer(which also 
serve as top contact). Each period of the SL consists of 6.5 nm GaAs well with 4×1017cm-3 Si donors and 3.5 
nm Al0.32Ga0.68As barrier (undoped). Each period of the QW consists of 5 nm GaAs well with 4×1017cm-3 Si 
donors and 60 nm Al0.21Ga0.79As barrier (undoped).The two n+- GaAs contact layers are doped with 
1×1018cm-3 Si donors. 
  Three detectors were farbricated from the same sample but with different mesas. D1 was processed to form 
the 150 μm × 150 μm square mesas and etched down to the emitter layer, then evaporated Au/Ge/Ni onto the 
top of each mesa as the collector and also the bottom as the emitter. However, SL1 and SL2 were etched 
down only to the SL with different etching depths as the emitters respectively. SL2 was etched more close to 
bottom contact (i.e more active region above bottom contact).Fig. 1 shows the band diagram of SL2 under 
low bias. A 45° facet on the substrate of the detector was fabricated to allow the TM polarized infrared light 
to radiate on the photodetectors. The absorption wavelength of the SLs and MQWs is about 6 to 10 µm. The 
bias polarity is defined as positive if high potential is applied on the collector. The photocurrent spectra are 
measured by the Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer[3,4]. 
 
Result and discussion 
Figures 2(a), 2(b) and2(c) plot the dark current at different temperatures and 20K photocurrent under 300K 
background radiation of D1, SL1 and SL2,respectively. D1 is under background limited infrared performance 
(BLIP) below 60K under the bias range from0~-3.5V with bias applied between top and bottom contacts. 
Similarly, SL1 is under 80K at -5~5V.It is noted that the background photocurrent and 100K dark current of 
SL 2 cross at 0.3 V. The inset of Fig. 2(c) shows its' detailed IV curve near 0V.The BLIP of temperature is 
very higher than it of QWIP.  
The photoelectrons can bounce back and forth between the thick and graded barriers then inject through the 
MQW to enhance the photocurrent. The function of thick barrier is to reflect electrons. The difficult 
supplement of photoelectrons from the emitter through thick barrier would result in charge supply limitation 
in SL layer. To avoid this problem, SL1 and SL2 were fabricated by etching down only to the SL active 
region. The bias is applied between the top and SL contacts with emitter contact open. 
To further demonstrate the high-temperature operation of SL2 and compare how the etching depth 
influences the performance, the peak spectral responsivity versus biases of these three detectors is measured. 
The photoresponse of d1 and SL1 can be observed up to 80K and 90K (Fig. 3),the peaks of d1 and SL1 are 
about 8.2µm and 8.4µm respectively. The photoresponse of SL2 can be observed up to 110K at 8.4µm. 
Moreover, the 110K peak responsivity of SL2 is comparable to the 90K peak responsivity of SL1 at 0.2~0.3V. 
The SL2 has better performace than SL1. So the etching depth is highly relative to the performance is proofed. 
The inset shows detectivity comparisons among these detectors. The maximum detectivity value of SL 2 at 
8.4µm at 0.3V is 2*109 cm Hz0.5/W which is comparable with it of SL1 at 90K and higher than it of D1 at

from the metal contact immediately to overcome this problem. Due to no accumulation ion charges, the 
photoelectrons excited to the second miniband can resonate in it, and then tunnel through the thin barrier to 
improve the performance as shown in Fig. 5a. As is schematically drawn in Fig. 5a, the energies of the top and 
bottom state of the second miniband is 182 and 242 meV, respectively. The photoelectrons can divide into 
long and short wavelength responses, then the dark current mechanism, interminiband relaxation from first to 
second miniband are also shown here. A 45〬facet on the substrate of the two detectors is fabricated to avoid 
the normal-incidence problem and makes it convenient to measure the response. The absorption wavelength 
of the SL is about 6 to 10 mm. In order to observe and compare the characteristics of detector 2, we design 
detector 3 which is a single-barrier SLIP. It consists of the same SL and thin barrier as detector 1.

Detector Performance 
 
The left and right insets of Fig. 6 show the I-V curves with temperatures of detectors 1 and 2, respectively. 
The solid lines and dashed one are dark current at 60–100 K and 300 K background photocurrent measured at 
20 K. From the insets of Fig. 6, we can observe that the I-V relationship in detector 1 is asymmetric, while 
that in detector 2 is quite symmetric with respect to the bias.[19–25] Due to the accumulated charges in SL 
layers, the I-V relationships of detectors 1 and 2 have different I-V shape under positive bias. The symmetry 
I-V relationship of detector 2 is possibly attributed to the flat second miniband is possible. The dotted and 
solid lines in Fig. 6 are the current comparison of detectors 1 and 2. The lines with and without squares show 
the 300 K background photocurrent and the dark current at different temperatures, respectively. It 
demonstrates that detector 2 has the lower dark current and higher 300 K background photocurrent. The dark 
current of detector 2 is decreased by an order as compared to detector 1 especially at 80 K and low bias, while 
8 
 
to no miniband originated from the space charge in detector 1 and no thick barrier for electrons resonance in 
detector 3, detector 2 has the better performance at very low bias and is more suitable for low-power 
applications. Because of the appropriate design of band structure as shown in Fig. 5a, only a small amount of 
short-wavelength photoexcited electrons will transport toward the collector directly, but most of the electrons 
will relax onto the bottom of second miniband and resonate in it to increase the tunneling probability.[26] For 
long-wavelength photoexcited electrons, almost all of them can resonate in the bottom of the second miniband. 
With increasing bias, the direct tunneling probability of short-wavelength electrons increases and the 
resonance phenomenon is less than that of long-wavelength. Therefore, we analyze the photoelectrons 
resonance of long-wavelength photoexcited electrons later.  
The spectral responsivity in the temperature range of 90–110 K at 0.17 V demonstrated high temperature 
operation of detector 2 shown in Fig. 7b. (Detector 3 can operate just up to 80 K.) Since the responsivity ratio 
of detector 2 to detector 3 is highest around 0.15 V, the high-temperature photoresponse measurement focuses 
on the bias around 0.15 V. The peak wavelength is around 9.2 mm at 90 and 100 K, and a weak responsivity 
at 110 K can be observed.The measured data shows that the optimum performance is at 0.17V. The max 
responsivity of detector 2 is about 0.015 A/W at 100 K and the corresponding maximum detectivity value is 
1.1×109 cmHz1/2/W at 0.17 V and 9.2 mm. The inset of Fig. 7b shows the dark current comparison of detector 
2 at 80 and 90 K, and detector 3 at 80 K. The 80 K dark current of detector 3 is slightly higher than that of 
detector 2, and comparable with 90 K dark current of detector 2. Dark current is critical for a detector to 
operate at high temperature and it affects its performances seriously. The dark electrons usually stay in the 
first miniband and then tunnel through the thin barrier until the assistant of thermal phonons.[27,28] Therefore, 
the dark electrons cannot resonate to enhance dark current but photoelectons can resonate in the bottom of the 
second miniband to enhance the photocurrent. The operation temperature of the detector can be significantly 
increased and this phenomenon is consistent with our design.  
Because detector 2 has a much higher responsivity and lower dark current compared to detector 1, the 
detectivity of detector 2 is better. In comparison with detector 3, detector 2 has a higher responsivity and 
comparable dark current as shown in Fig. 7a and the inset of Fig. 7b, respectively. The detectivity of detector 
2 is also better than detector 3. Figure 8 shows the comparison of detectivity at 80 K of the three detectors and 
our previous QWIP. The QWIP structure is 50 periods of 6.1 nm GaAs well (Nd=5×1017cm3 Si) and 50 nm 
Al0.23Ga0.77As barrier (undoped). Because the operational bias ranges of the SLIPs and the QWIP are different, 
the above x-axis in Fig. 8 is for the QWIP. It is observed that detector 2 has the highest detectivity of all the 
other detectors. Even though the QWIP has much higher responsivity than detector 2, the higher dark current 
deteriorates its performance. The maximum detectivity value of detector 2 is 1.2×1010 cm Hz1/2/W, which is 
higher than all of our previous works.[17],[26–28] Therefore, all the above analysis indicates that the thick 
barrier is helpful to enhance the photoresponse, especially under very low bias. The double-barrier design of 
detector 2 can enhance the tunneling probability of the photocurrent and dark current is not enhanced. So 
detector 2 has the best overall performance among them.  
To understand the detailed photoelectron mechanism, the theoretical calculation is taken into consideration. 
The photocurrent mechanism of detectors 2 and 3 are different whether the photoelectron resonance is in the

INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) have attracted more and more attention 
such as civil, military, and medical applications. The QWIP-based focal plane array (FPA) system with high 
performance has been demonstrated because of the highly developed epitaxy growth and process technology 
[29-33]. Superlattice (SL) is also a promising fundamental structure to fabricate infrared detector. In general, 
the structure of an ordinary SLIP is period of superlattice integrated with a single barrier. The roles of the 
single barrier are to reduce the dark current and act as a bias-tuned energy filter. [34, 35].  
Because bias dropped only on the single barrier, low-bias operation is needed for SLIP. Therefore it can 
achieve aims of the low dark current and low power consumption. Since there is no electric field across the 
SL, the electron mobility in SL is relatively low. On the other hand, photoelectrons can move back or forth in 
the second miniband of SL and only the forward electrons can punch through the thin barrier contribute to the 
photocurrent. Some backward and escaping photo-electrons have no contribution to photocurrent. Due to 
these factors, the responsivity of SLIPs is much lower than that of the QWIPs.  
In this paper, we design and study a SLIP whose structure is a 15-period SL sandwiched between front and 
rear barriers. The two barriers with different thickness are used for the photoelectrons to oscillate inside the 
SL to increase the probability of electrons emitting toward the collector, and thus more photoelectrons inject 
through the thin barrier to generate the higher photocurrent.

Figure 12.  The dark current (with squares) and photocurrent (without squares) comparison of Detector 1 
(dotted lines) and Detector 2 (solid lines). Photocurrent and the dark current are measured at 20 K and 
40 - 100 K, respectively. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In the following of this paper, we will present and compare these detectors’ performances first, including 
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, photoresponse and detectivity. Then, we will discuss the possible 
mechanisms which cause the differences between these detectors.       
 
 I-V Characteristics  
I-V curves are measured at different temperature of Detector 1 (Figure 11 (a)) and 2 (Figure 11 (b)). Dark 
current at 40-100 K and 300 K background photocurrent measured at 20 K are shown in solid and dashed 
lines. A very asymmetric I-V relationship is observed in Detector 1.  
Many experimental I-V characteristics of quantum-well (QW) or quantum-dot (QD) detectors show the 
asymmetry with the applied bias [36-41]. The detail mechanism is not yet resolved completely. In Detector 1, 
although the sample structure is asymmetric, electrons have to traverse both barriers to generate the current no 
matter under positive or negative bias. Hence, the I-V curves are expected to be symmetric. The cause of the 
asymmetry will be discussed later.  
Current comparison of Detectors 1 and 2 are shown in dotted and solid lines (Figure 12). The lines with and 
without squares represent 300 K background photocurrent measured at 20 K and the dark current at different 
temperatures, respectively. Clearly, Detector 2 shows higher 300 K background photocurrent and the lower 
dark current at any temperature. The dark current of Detector 2 at 80 K is lower than Detector 1 for an order at 
low bias, while the photocurrent is higher for more than one order at very low bias.

Detector 3 (dashed lines) in (a) linear scale and (b) log scale. The lines with and without squares 
present the responsivity at 80 K and 20 K, respectively. 
Detectivity  
Due to the much higher responsivity than Detector 1 and 3 at very low bias, the detectivity of Detector 2 is 
also better. Table 1 shows the comparison of detectivity at 80 K and different wavelength of these three 
detectors and one of our previous QWIP samples whose structure is 50 periods of 6.1 nm GaAs well and 50 
nm Al0.23Ga0.77As barrier. It is demonstrated that Detector 2 at low bias has the highest detectivity among 
them.  QWIP has much higher responsivity compared to Detector 2, but it has much higher dark current. So 
QWIP’s performance is not the best of them. The maximum detectivity of Detector 2 is 1.2×1010 cmHz1/2/W, 
which is the best among our previous works [42-45]. So far, all experimental results show the photoresponse 
at low bias can be enhanced by inserted thick barrier. Next, we will discuss the possible mechanisms occurred 
in these devices.

Discussions 
From Figure 11 (a) and (b), we can observe that the I-V relationship in Detector 1 is asymmetric, while that 
in Detector 2 is quite symmetric with respect to the bias. Because the only difference between these two 
devices is the position of emitter contact, we consider that the cause of the asymmetry is the limited supply of

CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, we have studied SLIP whose structure is a 15-period SL sandwiched between two rear and 
front barriers. In this detector, the photoelectrons excited from first miniband to second miniband of the SL 
can oscillate in the bottom of second miniband between front and rear barriers to improve performance at very 
low bias. Because of the limited supply of the electrons from the emitter to the SL cause the carrier depletion 
inside the SL. A large electric field across the thick barrier worsens the performance of the detector. The metal 
contact is formed on the SL layer instead of the emitter layer to solve this problem. The new-processed 
detector shows much higher responsivity at very low bias because the photoelectrons oscillation between the 
two barriers. This new-processed detector also shows the higher detectivity than the single-barrier SLIP and 
QWIP presented in our previous papers. This new-processed SLIP is potential for the low-power consumption 
applications due to best performance at low bias,

  由於是國際性的光電與通信盛會，所以在參加會議的過程中，可以不斷的吸收有關光電與通信領域
的最新發展與最新知識。我這次有幸以口頭報告論文被接受而以共同作者身份參與此次盛會，得以站
在這個國際性的殿堂與全世界的光電與通信工作者一起參與其中，感到十分榮幸。除了一般會議都有
的邀請演講，請到的都是各領域大師級的人物外，其餘的論文發表也讓我對於光電與通信領域的深度
與廣度有了更深一層的認識。 
  雖然大多數的主題和我所做的題目並不相關，但可以藉此瞭解各領域的發展，並得知科技進步的程
度，也是令人難忘的經驗。尤其是來自世界各地的廠商無不卯足全勁讓大家看到自己公司的最新發展，
各式各樣意想不到的通信產品，光電元件，讓人看的目不暇給，對於科技的發展的進步又有了新的體
認。 
  這次參與會議，對於許多研究團隊都是跨校或甚至跨國際的研究計畫感到驚訝，尤其是看到全
世界許多的頂尖學者的合作研究得到了驚人的成果，讓我深深覺得台灣應該要努力走向國際化，
才能將視野提升到國際級的水準，雖然台灣現在的研究成果已經在世界上佔有了一席之地，不過
相對來說，我們的國際合作機會並不普遍，機會也相對較少，也許這是我們以後應該努力的目標，
做出更好的研究成果以吸引國際上一流的研究團隊與我們合作，增加自己在國際上發光發熱的機
會。在我報告的當天早上還有來自中正大學的一位教授，他的口頭報告非常值得我學習，臺風相
當穩健沉著，英文也說得非常流利，這對於第一次出國參與國際會議口頭報告的我來說，是一個
最佳學習的範例。 
 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
  無 
四、建議 
  相對於我們一般在國內參與的所謂國際性的研討會大多都是台灣研究團隊參加，國外的研討會所提
供的深度與廣度確實不是國內研討會可以相提並論的。在這樣國際性的舞台之上，雖然也看到了不少
台灣人參與其中，可是也希望有朝一日台灣可以自行舉辦類似規模的研討會，一方面可以讓我們參與
會議者可以免除舟車勞頓之苦，也可以提升台灣的國際能見度。 
  現今國家政府財政並不寬裕，所以補助學生的款項並不充足，雖然我此次有幸承蒙教育部補助，但
金額其實遠遠不足夠，對我們這些參與會議的學生而言，出國參與會議實為一沈重的經濟負擔，也許
以後學校可以以類似助學貸款的方式先行補助學生的出國費用，待往後再慢慢償還。出國開會對學生
與國際學者接觸是很重要的，除了可以加強自己的外語能力，也可以證明自己的研究成果足以站在世
界的舞台，對自己也是一種肯定。如果可能的話，希望能將補助金額提高，或尋求相關的解決方式，
以減輕學生的經濟壓力，如此一來也可大大激勵學生投稿國際會議的動力。

consists of 5 nm GaAs well with 4×1017cm-3 Si donors 
and 60 nm Al0.21Ga0.79As barrier (undoped).The two n+- 
GaAs contact layers are doped with 1×1018cm-3 Si 
donors. 
Three detectors were farbricated from the same sample 
but with different mesas. D1 was processed to form the 
150 μm × 150 μm square mesas and etched down to the 
emitter layer, then evaporated Au/Ge/Ni onto the top of 
each mesa as the collector and also the bottom as the 
emitter. However, SL1 and SL2 were etched down only 
to the SL with different etching depths as the emitters 
respectively. SL2 was etched more close to bottom 
contact (i.e more active region above bottom contact).Fig. 
1 shows the band diagram of SL2 under low bias. A 45° 
facet on the substrate of the detector was fabricated to 
allow the TM polarized infrared light to radiate on the 
photodetectors. The absorption wavelength of the SLs 
and MQWs is about 6 to 10 µm. The bias polarity is 
defined as positive if high potential is applied on the 
collector. The photocurrent spectra are measured by the 
Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer[3,4].   
 
III.  Result and discussion 
 
Figures 2(a), 2(b) and2(c) plot the dark current at 
different temperatures and 20K photocurrent under 300K 
background radiation of D1, SL1 and SL2,respectively. 
D1 is under background limited infrared performance 
(BLIP) below 60K under the bias range from0~-3.5V 
with bias applied between top and bottom contacts. 
Similarly, SL1 is under 80K at -5~5V.It is noted that the 
background photocurrent and 100K dark current of SL 2 
cross at 0.3 V. The inset of Fig. 2(c) shows its' detailed 
IV curve near 0V.The BLIP of temperature is very 
higher than it of QWIP.  
The photoelectrons can bounce back and forth between 
the thick and graded barriers then inject through the 
MQW to enhance the photocurrent. The function of thick 
barrier is to reflect electrons. The difficult supplement of 
photoelectrons from the emitter through thick barrier 
would result in charge supply limitation in SL layer. To 
avoid this problem, SL1 and SL2 were fabricated by 
etching down only to the SL active region. The bias is 
applied between the top and SL contacts with emitter 
contact open. 
. To further demonstrate the high-temperature operation 
of SL2 and compare how the etching depth influences 
the performance, the peak spectral responsivity versus 
biases of these three detectors is measured. The 
photoresponse of d1 and SL1 can be observed up to 80K 
and 90K (Fig. 3),the peaks of d1 and SL1 are about 
8.2µm and 8.4µm respectively. The photoresponse of 
SL2 can be observed up to 110K at 8.4µm. Moreover, 
the 110K peak responsivity of SL2 is comparable to the 
90K peak responsivity of SL1 at 0.2~0.3V. The SL2 has 
better performace than SL1. So the etching depth is 
highly relative to the performance is proofed. The inset 
shows detectivity comparisons among these detectors. 
The maximum detectivity value of SL 2 at 8.4µm at 0.3V 
is 2*109 cm Hz0.5/W which is comparable with it of SL1 
at 90K and higher than it of D1 at 80K. The noise in 
MQWs is the generation-recombination noise[5,6] and is 
given by DnQW
Iegi 42 
, so MQWs can be used as 
noise filter since gn is much less than 1 at low biases 
especially at high temperature[7,8].  The photocurrent 
of SL is not reduced by MQWs but associated noise 
power is. 
The SL2 shows multi-color detection (Fig. 4(a)) at 8μm 
from SLIP and 10μm from QWIP under 80K 
respectively. However, the 10μm peak disappeared at 
90K due to high dark current magnitude of QWIP under 
high temperature. The 10μm peak from QWIP at 20K is 
comparable with 8μm peak from SLIP at temperature 
80-110K (Fig. 4(b)).The inset shows the temperature 
independence of 8μm peak for high-temperature 
responsivity. The 8μm and 10μm peaks increases and 
decreases with temperature elevated.   
 
IV.  Conclusion 
 
  
Fig. 3 The peak responsivity comparison of Detector 1, SL1 
and SL2 at 80K 90K and 110K respectively. The inset shows 
comparison of detectivity of that under the same condition.

of SL2 with bias range of 0.3~1.1V and The inset shows that at 
90K of SL2 at 0.2 V, 0.4 V and 0.6V. (b) The 10μm peak from 
QWIP at 20K is comparable with 8μm peak from SLIP at 
temperature 80-110K.
