D/A, and computational delay, the time spent to implement the digital controller, is between 1 and 1.5 
samples of delay [8]. 
This research intends to focus on frequency response and to derive a method which can address the 
time delay and computational delay problem, and offer the flexibility to modify the design to suit the 
controllers or filters. A performance index which accounts for balancing magnitude and phase response 
with compensation of computational and sampling delays is proposed. Since an analytic solution for the 
proposed performance index is hard to get, a real-coded genetic algorithm will be used to search the 
numerical solution. The proposed genetic-algorithm-based digital redesign can adaptively balance on the 
replication of either “magnitude” or “phase” response, or even any particular frequency segment and 
compensate for sampling and computational delays. Finally, some examples are provided to illustrate the 
design effectiveness.

For controller design, these knots are equally spaced within the closed loop system bandwidth to 
replicate their analog counterparts. In order to compensate for the delays caused by sampling devices and 
computational delay, and ensure the stability, the performance index or cost function must be modified as

GA process can be stopped if no further improvement can be made.

Fig. 1. The magnitude and phase response of a sixth-order Butterworth low-pass filter. 
As shown in figure 1, the magnitude response of GA filter is a better approximation of the original 
analog filter than the bilinear transform filter. And the phase response of GA is almost a duplicate of the 
analog counterpart. The magnitude response can be further improved by putting more emphasis on the 
magnitude by increasing the weighting function α. 
Example 2 (wideband system modeling): Given the wide band system )(sG  below with a band width 
of 1500 rad/sec and a sampling time of 2.094 ms, the Bilinear transform converts this function )(sG  into 
the digital function )(zGBT . Both the transformed digital model )(zGBT  and its cost BTJ  are shown

The step response, simulated with the Simulink block diagram shown in Fig. 4, shows that the system 
response using GA-based digital controller resembles the one using analog controller when the delay 
compensation Nsd is set at 1.5, 1.2, and 1.0, respectively. 
5.  CONCLUSIONS 
Simulation results show that this genetic-based digital redesign method can outperform the bilinear 
transform, and the magnitude and phase response of digital one can approach the response of the analog 
counterparts. The result also shows that the warping effect of bilinear transform becomes serious in the 
high frequency segment whereas our redesign method still maintains good performance. This digital 
redesign method can almost exactly duplicate the frequency response of the original analog model and filter 
with only an insignificant deviation in a small part of the frequency segment. Since the method has built in 
itself the flexibility to address the importance of certain part of the frequency segment, whether it is 
magnitude or phase, replication of the original response at any particular part is possible. The effect of 
calculation time and sampling time delays on the system performance is taken into account when applying 
digital controller redesign in this study. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the design 
procedure and effectiveness. From these simulation results, the proposed method is simple and suitable for 
practical modeling, filter, and controller digital redesign.

Robust Static Output Feedback Fuzzy Control Design for Nonlinear
Systems with Persistent Bounded Disturbances: A Singular Value
Decomposition Approach
Chung-Shi Tseng, SeniorMember, IEEE and Hwa-Lu Jhi
Abstract–This study introduces L∞− gain static output
feedback fuzzy control design for nonlinear systems via T-S
fuzzy models. Unlike the L2 − gain (H∞) control case, the
L∞−gain control problem is dealing with persistent bounded
disturbances. The structure of static output feedback con-
troller is much simpler than that of dynamic output feedback
controller. A singular value decomposition (SVD) method is
proposed to solve the L∞−gain static output feedback fuzzy
control problem. By the proposed SVD method, the problem
of L∞ − gain static output feedback fuzzy control design
for nonlinear systems is characterized in terms of solving a
linear matrix inequality problem (LMIP) if some scalars are
specified in advance.
I. Introduction
Recently there are many studies concerned with
the systematic synthesis of static output feedback control
design for nonlinear systems using the Takagi-Sugeno
(T-S) fuzzy models. When dealing with output feedback
control design, either a dynamic output feedback (fuzzy
observer-based) case or a static output feedback case
is considered. For the dynamic output feedback case,
a fuzzy observer is also involved as well as the fuzzy
controller [1], [2], [3]. In other words, for the fuzzy
observer-based output feedback control design, a fuzzy
observer should also be involved to estimate the system
states using the output information and a fuzzy controller
is constructed using the estimated states. For the static
output feedback case [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12],
the fuzzy controller depends on the system outputs only
without the complex structures of the fuzzy observer.
Strictly speaking, some of these studies are not purely
static output feedback control cases since their proposed
fuzzy controllers still depend on some measurable states
to construct the premise variables [9], [11]. In general,
the control design of static output feedback is more
straightforward but less flexible than that of dynamic
output feedback and the structure of static output
feedback controller is much simpler than that of dynamic
output feedback controller. Unlike the L2 − gain (H∞)
control case [4], [7], [9], [12], in this study an L∞− gain
static output feedback fuzzy controller is proposed to
reduce the influence of the peak (i.e., L∞ − norm) of

nology, Hsin-Feng, 30401, Taiwan (email: cstseng@must.edu.tw and

external disturbance on the peak (i.e., L∞ − norm)
of the output signal as small as possible. Therefore,
the L∞ − gain static output feedback fuzzy controller
may be more suitable for some practical applications
because control engineers may concern more about the
peak (amplitude) than the total energy of the perturbed
signal. A SVD method is proposed in this study to solve
the L∞−gain static output feedback fuzzy control design
for nonlinear systems, which can be characterized in
terms of solving a LMIP if some scalars are specified
in advance. The LMIP can be eﬃciently solved by
using a LMI-based optimization method. The proposed
SVD approach provides diﬀerent aspect from the linear
transformation approach [4] and moreover the proposed
SVD method is very simple and easy to follow.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2,
L∞ − gain static output feedback fuzzy control design
for nonlinear dynamic systems with persistent bounded
disturbances is introduced, while some simulation results
are presented in Section 3. Finally, concluding remarks
are made in Section 4. Some notations and definitions
used in this study are |x(t)| ∆=sxT (t)x(t) for x(t) ∈ Rn,
nx(t)n∞
∆
= supt |x(t)| for x(t) ∈ Rn, and x(t) ∈ L∞ if
nx(t)n∞ <∞.
II. L∞ − gain Static Output Feedback Fuzzy Control
Design for Nonlinear Dynamic Systems
The ith rule of the fuzzy linear model for a
nonlinear system is of the following form [4], [5], [6],
[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]
Plant Rule i :
If z1(t) is Fi1 . . . and zg(t) is Fig
Then
x˙(t) = Aix(t) +B1iu(t) +B2iw(t)
y(t) = Cx(t) for i = 1, 2, . . . , L
(1)
where x(t) ∈ Rn×1 denotes the vector of the states,
u(t) ∈ Rm×1 denotes the vector of the control inputs;
w(t) ∈ Rp×1 denotes the vector of the bounded external
disturbances; y(t) ∈ Rr×1 denotes the vector of the
outputs; Ai ∈ Rn×n, B1i ∈ Rn×m, B2i ∈ Rn×p, C ∈
Rr×n; and z1(t), . . . , zg(t) are the premise variables.
Remark 1: Since the static output feedback control is
considered in this study, the only information we have
is the system output y(t) and thus the premise variables
z1(t), . . . , zg(t) ∈ y(t) = [y1(t), ..., yr(t)]T with g ≤ r

Step 5: Decrease ε2 and repeat Step 4-5 until Q > 0
can not be found. If Q > 0 can not be found
for all possible ε2, try another set of α > 0 and
c > 0 and repeat Step 3-5.
Step 6: Construct the static output feedback fuzzy
controller (5).
Remark 5: Note that (31) is a standard LMIP, if

advance. Therefore, parameters Q = diag{Q1,Q2} and

−1U−1 can be determined simultaneously
from (31). Software packages such as LMI optimization
toolbox in Matlab [16] have been developed for this
purpose and can be employed to easily solve the LMIP.
III. Simulation Example
To illustrate the proposed fuzzy control approach,
a control problem of stabilizing a chaotic system is
considered in this study. For this example, the Lorenz’s
equation with input and output terms is given by
x˙1 = −10x1 + 10x2 + u(t) + 0.1w1
x˙2 = 28x1 − x2 − x1x3 + 0.1w2
x˙3 = x1x2 − 8/3x3 + 0.1w3
y1 = x1
y2 = 5x2 + x3 (32)
where external disturbance w =

w1, w2, w3
T
=
50 sin(10t), 50 cos(10t), 50[sin(10t) + cos(10t)]
T
∈ L∞.
In this example, the Lorenz’s equation can be exactly
represented by the following two-rule fuzzy model under
x1 (= y1) ∈

−κ, κ

[17].
Rule 1 : IF y1 is F1
THEN x˙ = A1x+B11u+B21w, and y = Cx.
Rule 2 : IF y1 is F2
THEN x˙ = A2x+B12u+B22w, and y = Cx.
where

The Design Procedure in the above section can be
made simpler by letting α = c then the minimization
problem in (30) can be solved by performing one-
dimensional search on the parameter α. According to the
Design Procedure, the following table shows subminimal
values of ε2 corresponding to some values of α with
r = 50.

In the case of α = c = 2.0 and ε = 0.05, the LMIP

Robust Static Output Feedback Fuzzy Control Design for a Class of
Nonlinear Stochastic Systems
Chung-Shi Tseng, SeniorMember, IEEE and Bor-Sen Chen, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract–This paper describes the robust static output
feedback H∞ fuzzy control design for a class of nonlinear
stochastic systems. The system dynamic is modelled by Itoˆ-
type stochastic diﬀerential equations. For general nonlinear
stochastic systems, the H∞ control can be obtained by
solving a second-order nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi inequality.
In general, it is diﬃcult to solve the second-order nonlinear
Hamilton-Jacobi inequality. Using fuzzy approach (T-S fuzzy
model), the H∞ fuzzy control design for the nonlinear
stochastic systems can be given via solving linear matrix
inequalities (LMIs) instead of a second-order Hamilton-Jacobi
inequality. A singular value decomposition (SVD) method is
proposed in this study to solve the H∞ static output feedback
fuzzy control problem. By the proposed SVD method, the
problem of H∞ static output feedback fuzzy control design
for nonlinear stochastic systems is characterized in terms of
solving an eigenvalue problem (EVP). This EVP can be easily
solved by using a LMI-based optimization method. Simulation
example is provided to illustrate the design procedure and the
expected performances.
I. Introduction
The deterministic output feedback H∞ control
problem is to design a controller using output feed-
back only, which guarantees the L2 gain less than a
prescribed level [1]. On the other hand, the stochastic
H∞ control problems with system models expressed by
Itoˆ-type stochastic diﬀerential equations have become
a popular research topic, and have gained extensive
attention [2], [3], [4], [5]. Most of the above works are
limited to the linear stationary stochastic systems, while
[3] and [4] discussed the linear and nonlinear stochastic
H∞ control problems. Unlike the deterministic case,
the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI) associated with
nonlinear stochastic H∞ control is a second-order (not
first-order) nonlinear partial diﬀerential inequality due
to the eﬀect of the diﬀusion term, which makes the
stochastic H∞ control problem more complex [5]. In
general, it is very diﬃcult to solve the second-order
nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi inequality.
In the past few years, there has been rapidly grow-
ing interest in fuzzy control for the nonlinear systems
using T-S fuzzy model. However, most of them are
state feedback cases. On the other hand, there are few
studies concerned with the systematic synthesis of output

feedback control design for nonlinear systems using the
T-S fuzzy models. The output feedback control design
for nonlinear systems using the T-S fuzzy models is
more general and complex than the state feedback one.
When dealing with output feedback control design, either
a dynamic output feedback (fuzzy observer-based) case
or a static output feedback case is considered. For the
dynamic output feedback case, a fuzzy observer is also
involved as well as the fuzzy controller [6], [7], [8].
In other words, for the fuzzy observer-based output
feedback control design, a fuzzy observer should also be
involved to estimate the system states using the output
information and a fuzzy controller is constructed using
the estimated states. For the static output feedback case
[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], the fuzzy
controller depends on the system outputs only without
the complex structures of the fuzzy observer. In general,
the control design of static output feedback is more
straightforward but less flexible than that of dynamic
output feedback and the structure of static output
feedback controller is much simpler than that of dynamic
output feedback controller. This study introduces H∞
static output feedback fuzzy control design for a class
of nonlinear stochastic systems via T-S fuzzy models.
First, a T-S fuzzy model is proposed to approximate
a class of nonlinear stochastic systems. Next, based on
the T-S fuzzy model, the static output feedback H∞
fuzzy control design for the nonlinear stochastic systems
is characterized in terms of minimizing the attenuation
level subject to some linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
A SVD method is proposed in this study to solve the
H∞ static output feedback fuzzy control design for
nonlinear stochastic systems, which can be characterized
in terms of solving an eigenvalue problem (EVP) [18]
instead of a second-order Hamilton-Jacobi inequality.
The EVP can be easily solved by using a LMI-based
optimization method [19]. The SVD approach provides
diﬀerent aspect from the linear transformation approach
[9], [14] and moreover the proposed SVD method is
very simple and easy to follow. Simulation example
is provided to illustrate the design procedure and the
expected performance.
The main contributions of this paper are stated as
follows: (1) The H∞ output feedback control problem
for a class of nonlinear stochastic systems is studied via
a static output feedback fuzzy controller. (2) A SVD
method is proposed to solve H∞ static output feedback
fuzzy control problem which can be characterized in

The final output of the fuzzy system is inferred as
follows:
dx(t) =
L[
i=1
hi(z(t)){[Aix(t) +Biu(t)
+Div(t)]dt+Eix(t)dW (t)} (8)
where
hi(z(t)) =
µi(z(t))
LS
i=1
µi(z(t))
, (9)
µi(z(t)) =
g\
j=1
Fij(zj(t)),
z(t) = [z1(t), z2(t), . . . , zg(t)],
and Fij(zj(t)) is the grade of membership of zj(t) in Fij .
It is assumed that
µi(z(t)) ≥ 0, for i = 1, 2, . . . , L
and
L[
i=1
µi(z(t)) > 0, for all t.
Therefore, we get
hi(z(t)) ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , L (10)
and
L[
i=1
hi(z(t)) = 1. (11)
Hence, the static output feedback fuzzy controller is
proposed as
u(t) =
L[
j=1
hj(z(t))Kjy(t) =
L[
j=1
hj(z(t))KjCx(t) (12)
where Kj is the control gain for the jth controller rule.
After manipulation, the closed-loop system can be
expressed as the following form:
dx(t) =
L[
i=1
hi(z(t)){[Aijx(t)
+Div(t)]dt+Eix(t)dW (t)} (13)
where
Aij = Ai +BiKjC. (14)
The nonlinear stochastic H∞ fuzzy control problem
can be stated as follows: Find the fuzzy control gain Kj
( for j = 1, ..., L ) such that
(i) The equilibrium point x(t) ≡ 0 of the closed-
loop system in (13) is globally asymptotically stable in
probability in the case of v(t) = 0.
(ii) For a given disturbance attenuation level γ > 0,
the following relation (H∞ performance) holds,
nx(t)n2L2 ≤ 2E[V (x(0))] + γ
2nv(t)n2L2 , (15)
∀v(t) ∈ L2F(R+,Rnv ), v(t) 9= 0, where V (x) ∈ C2(Rn)
is a positive function.
Then, we obtain the following main result.
