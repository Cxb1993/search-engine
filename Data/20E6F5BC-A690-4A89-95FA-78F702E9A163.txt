螢光譜(low temperature to room temperature photoluminescence)量測中，發現量子井寬度較窄的
LED 結構，其估算的相對內部量子效率最高，相信這是由於量子井寬度較窄的結構，其所受

英文摘要: 
Efficiency droop behavior of InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) light emitting diodes 
(LEDs) with various well thicknesses is discussed and demonstrated. Thinner well structure has 
higher external quantum efficiency but efficiency decreased drastically with high current-density 
injection. On the other hand, simulated results reveal that decrease of luminous efficiency is 
attributed to dislocation, Auger recombination, and carrier overflow. We propose that these 3 
different mechanisms affect efficiency droop behavior from low to high current density. 
 
前言 
For last several years, the epitaxy technology of III-V nitride materials has been rapidly 
developed so that emission efficiencies of LEDs based on this material system have been improved 
drastically.  The large bandgap energy makes the III-V nitride material very suitable for fabricating 
short-wavelength LEDs, i.e. green, blue and UV LEDs.  Nichia’s 460 nm blue LED chips with an 
external quantum efficiency of more than 40% have been realized, along with white LEDs providing 
more than 130 lm/W luminous efficiencies.  Therefore, LED light sources have become very 
competitive in many applications such as large area signs, traffic signals, and automobile lighting.  
With the development of nitride-based short wavelength LEDs, i.e. green, blue and violet LEDs, 
LED emission can cover the entire visible wavelength range from 390 nm to 720 nm. 
Today, high-brightness LEDs are used for many applications.  For example, automobile 
exterior lighting has been moving rapidly to incorporate transparent-substrate AlInGaP technology 
into high-mount stoplights and into the full amber and red-orange taillight assembly; traffic-signal 
applications have begun to incorporate red AlInGaP and blue-green AlInGaN based LEDs. The liquid 
crystal display (LCD) backlight is becoming a new market for LED application. With very high 
case, the injection factor is to unity. As the forward bias at the p-n junction increases, electrons begin 
to penetrate into the p-type region, the emitter efficiency decreases and recombination extends 
beyond the active region. It is this process that results in a decrease in the injection efficiency. Thus, 
an optimized design on the electron/hole blocking layer is needed.  
We have designed different LED structures and simulate these structures with SiLENSe 
(Simulator of Light Emitters based on Nitride Semiconductors). After a good understanding on the 
potential LED structures, we had LED epitaxy with MOCVD system. 
In our work, InGaN/GaN-based blue LEDs with various quantum well thicknesses are 
fabricated and characterized. The epitaxial structures of the InGaN/GaN LEDs in this study are 
grown on a c-plane (0001) sapphire substrate with a Veeco metal-organic chemical vapor deposition 
system using a high speed rotating disk with a vertical gas-flow growth chamber. On top of the 
sapphire substrate, a 20 nm thick GaN nucleation layer is grown at low temperature flowed by a 
thick (4 um) n-type GaN buffer layer. After buffer layer growth, a ten-period InGaN/GaN MQW 
active region is grown with growth rate controlled about 1.5 nm / min. Note that only pre-four of 
quantum barriers are doped with Si. A thin (10 nm) Mg doped p-type AlGaInN is grown on top of 
MQW and flowed by two sets of p-type AlGaN/GaN (10 nm/ 2 nm) layers which serve as 
electron-blocking layer. Finally, p-type GaN cladding layer (120 nm) with heavily Mg doped is 
grown. For processing, LED chips utilizing transparent conduction indium tin oxide layers are 
fabricated. Ni/Au and Ti/Al/Ti/Au metallizations are deposited by e-beam evaporation to serve as 
p-type and n-type Ohmic contacts, respectively. hicknesses of each well in these samples by 
changing the growth time are 1.5 nm (1 min), 2 nm (1.33 min), and 2.5 nm (1.67 min), respectively. 
All LED chips (350×350 μm2) are packaged with same standard formation. Optical characteristics 
are measured in integrated sphere with high-resolution spectrometer, pulsed current is injected with 
pulse duration 3 ms and duty cycle 5 % by Keithley 2400 source meter. 
 
 
結果與討論 
 The measurements of External quantum efficiency versus inject current density are shown in 
Fig. 1. Investigation of Fig. 1 reveals a variety efficiency droop behavior of each sample. For well 
structure 1.5 nm, 2 nm, and 2.5 nm, the reduction from efficiency peak to lowest is 43.8 %, 26.3 %, 
and 2.9 %, respectively. This measurement is completed with pulsed current injection to prevent 
heating. In this experiment, a significant reduction of efficiency droop is observed for the LED with 
the thickest (2.5 nm) design. However, thick well structure lead to lowest emitting efficiency which 
is attributed to larger spatial separation of electrons and holes – cause by strong internal electric field. 
We propose that efficiency droop behavior is related to Auger recombination and carrier overflow at 
different current density region. 
various well thicknesses have been proposed by both experimental and simulation results. According 
to simulation results, the efficiency droop behavior from low to high current density is contributed by 
Auger recombination first, then cause by carrier overflow at higher current density. Thicker well 
structure has less Auger effect in quantum well and less carriers escape from active region, but it 
reveals the lowest external quantum efficiency is caused by strong internal electric field.
