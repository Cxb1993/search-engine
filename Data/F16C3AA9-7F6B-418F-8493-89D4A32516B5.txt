units.14 Triarylamines can be easily oxidized to form stable radi-
cal cations, and the oxidation process is always associated with
a noticeable change of coloration. Thus, many triarylamine-
based polymers have been reported for potential electrochromic
applications.15
In recent years, we have developed a number of high-per-
formance polymers such as polyamides16 and polyimides17
carrying the triarylamine unit as a redox-chromophore. The
triarylamine-containing monomers such as diamines and
dicarboxylic acids could be easily prepared using well-estab-
lished procedures,18,19 and they could react with the corre-
sponding comonomers through conventional polycondensa-
tion techniques, producing the desired triarylamine-based
polyamides and polyimides with high glass transition and
decomposition temperatures. Because of the incorporation of
packing-disruptive, propeller-shaped triarylamine units along
the polymer backbone, the resulting polymers generally
exhibited good solubility in many organic solvents. They
could afford tough and flexible films with good mechanical
properties via simple solution processing, which is advanta-
geous for their ready fabrication of large-area, thin-film devi-
ces. In view of the attractive properties associated with the
pyrene and triarylamine units; herein, we report the synthe-
sis of novel poly(amide-hydrazide)s (PAHs) from the direct
polycondensation of dicarboxylic acid monomer 1, N,N-di
(4-carboxyphenyl)-1-aminopyrene, with two amine-hydrazide
monomers. These PAHs were further converted into the
poly(amide-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s (PAOXs) by thermal cyclodehy-
dration in the solid state. The random sequence present in
the polymer backbone results in an enhanced solubility to
these polymers. The resulting polymers exhibited strong
blue photoluminescence (PL) in both solution and solid
states due to the pyrene unit. They also showed a high
electroactivity and changed colors on redox reactions of the
diphenylpyrenylamine and oxadiazole units. Some properties
of the present polymers are compared with those of struc-
turally related ones derived from 4,40-dicarboxytriphenylamine.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
N,N-Di(4-carboxyphenyl)-1-aminopyrene (1) (mp ¼ 312–
314 C)20 and 4,40-dicarboxytriphenylamine (mp ¼ 313–
315 C)21 were synthesized according to the procedures
reported previously. p-Aminobenzoyl hydrazide (p-ABH) and
m-aminobenzoyl hydrazide (m-ABH) were used as received
from TCI and Alfa Aesar, respectively. N,N-Dimethylacetamide
(DMAc) (Tedia), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Tedia),
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Tedia), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP) (Tedia), pyridine (Py) (Wako), and diphenyl phosphite
(DPP) (Acros) were also used without further purification.
Calcium chloride (CaCl2) and tetrabutylammonium perchlo-
rate (Bu4NClO4) were dried in vacuo before use. All other
reagents and solvents were used as received from commer-
cial sources.
Synthesis of Poly(amide-hydrazide)s
The PAHs were synthesized by the phosphorylation polycon-
densation reaction22 of dicarboxylic acid monomer 1 with
aminobenzoyl hydrazides p-ABH and m-ABH. A typical syn-
thetic procedure for PAH p-2 is described as follows. A 50-
mL flask was charged with dicarboxylic acid monomer 1
(0.3889 g; 0.85 mmol), p-ABH (0.1284 g; 0.85 mmol), NMP
(1.0 mL), CaCl2 (0.1 g), DPP (1.0 mL), and pyridine (0.4 mL).
The mixture was heated with stirring at 120 C for 5 h. The
resulting viscous solution was poured slowly with stirring
into 200 mL of methanol, giving rise to a tough, fibrous pre-
cipitate. The precipitated product was collected by filtration,
washed repeatedly with methanol and hot water, and dried
to give a quantitative yield (0.483 g, 99%) of PAH p-2. The
inherent viscosity of the PAH was 0.51 dL g1, measured in
NMP at a concentration of 0.5 g dL1 at 30 C. The IR spec-
trum of PAH p-2 (film) exhibited characteristic amide and
hydrazide absorption bands overlapped at 3298 (NAH str.)
and 1,657 cm1 (carbonyl str.).

Film Preparation and Cyclodehydration of the Hydrazide
Polymers
A solution of polymer was made by dissolving about 0.5 g of
the PAH sample in 10 mL of DMAc, and the homogeneous
solution was poured into a 7-cm glass Petri dish, which was
placed in a 90 C oven overnight to remove most of the sol-
vent. The polymer film was released from the glass substrate
and further dried at 150 C in vacuum for 6 h. The obtained
films with the thickness of 60–70 lm were used for X-ray
diffraction measurements, solubility tests, and thermal analy-
ses. The cyclodehydration of the PAHs to the corresponding
PAOXs were carried out by successive heating the above fab-
ricated polymer films at 250 C for 30 min, 300 C for 1 h,
and then 350 C for 3 h under vacuum.
Measurements
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 FTIR
spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in a Heraeus Var-
ioEL-III CHNS elemental analyzer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were measured on a Bruker AVANCE-500 FT-NMR using tet-
ramethylsilane as the internal standard. The inherent viscos-
ities were determined at 0.5 g dL1 concentration using a
Cannon-Fenske viscometer at 30 C. Wide-angle X-ray diffrac-
tion (WAXD) measurements were performed at room tem-
perature (ca. 25 C) on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffrac-
tometer (40 kV, 30 mA), using graphite-monochromatized
Cu-Ka radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was con-
ducted with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were
carried out on  3–5 mg film samples heated in flowing
nitrogen or air (flow rate ¼ 20 cm3 min1) at a heating rate
of 20 C min1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was
performed on a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 DSC at a scan rate of
20 C min1 in flowing nitrogen (20 cm3 min1). Absorption
spectra were measured with an Agilent 8453 UV–visible
diode array spectrophotometer. PL spectra were measured

the synthesized PAHs. The 1H NMR and HAH COSY spectra
included in Figure 1 confirm the correct structure of PAH
p-2.
Thermal conversion of the hydrazide group to the 1,3,4-oxa-
diazole ring was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The typical
IR spectra for the representative PAH p-2 and PAOX p-3 are
illustrated in Figure 2. After thermally curing at 350 C for 3
h, the conversion from PAH p-2 to PAOX p-3 could be con-
firmed by a decreased intensity in the carbonyl (1,660
1,670 cm1) and NAH stretching (3,298 cm1) absorptions.
The bands at around 1,490 and 1,600 cm1 represent contri-
butions from the oxadiazole and phenylene ring skeletal
vibrations. The experiment conditions for the cyclization
were selected on the basis of the weight loss behavior
observed by dynamic TGA and the cyclodehydration endo-
therm on the DSC thermogram. A typical pair of DSC and
TGA curves of PAH p-2 and PAOX p-3 are illustrated in Fig-
ures 3 and 4, respectively. The main endothermic peak on
the DSC curve and the weight loss at the first stage of the
TGA thermogram reveal that the cyclodehydration reaction
of hydrazide group with water evolution occurred in the
range of 280–350 C. The chemical compositions of the ther-
mally converted oxadiazole polymers were also confirmed by
the elemental analysis results listed in Table 2. For a com-
parative purpose, referenced PAH 20 and PAOX 30 (see
Scheme 1) were also prepared from 4,40-dicarboxytriphenyl-
amine with p- and m-ABH by a similar synthetic procedure
as that for PAH 2 and PAOX 3.
Organo-solubility and Film Morphology
The solubility behavior of all the polymers was tested quali-
tatively in various organic solvents, and the results are also
summarized in Table 1. All the PAHs were readily soluble in
polar organic solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF, DMSO, and
m-cresol, and the thermally cured PAOXs were also dissolved
in NMP and DMAc at room temperature and in hot DMF and
DMSO. The good solubility associated with these polymers
could be attributed to the presence of propeller-shaped triar-
yalmine structure, bulky pendent pyrene group, and

351–380 nm in NMP solutions, assignable to the p–p* transi-
tions of the pyrene and other p-conjugated moieties in the
polymer backbone. In the solid state, the PAHs and PAOXs
showed absorption characteristics similar to those observed
in solutions, with low-energy absorption kmax centered at
359–380 nm with absorption onsets at 430–443 nm corre-
sponding to optical bandgaps of 2.80–2.88 eV. Their PL spec-
tra in NMP solutions showed maximum bands around 457–
459 nm in the blue region with fluorescence quantum yield
(UPL) ranging from 32.4% for p-3 to 58.4% for m-2. The
decreased UPL values (32.4 42.6%) for the PAOXs p-3 and
m-3 may be caused by self-quenching due to intermolecular
electronic interactions between diphenylpyrenylamine donors
and benzoyl/oxadiazole acceptors. Less fluorescence effi-
ciency of the polymers derived from p-ABH when compared
with those from m-ABH might be attributed to the quenching
effect arising from interchain charge transfer. Larger Stokes
shift (ca. 79 nm) for the PAOX p-3 might be explained by its
longer p-conjugation length in the backbone. In addition, all of
the polymers exhibited a slightly red-shifted emission in the
solid state when compared with that measured in NMP solu-
tions, possibly due to an increased interchain interaction in
the film form. Although the PAOXs exhibited a decreased UPL,
their thin solid films showed an obvious blue or sky-blue PL
when irradiated by a standard laboratory UV lamp (see the
photos shown on the bottom of Fig. 6). The highest UPL
(58.4%) of PAH m-2 can be rationalized by the decreasing
charge transfer effect caused by the meta-catenation of ABH.
In general, these new polymers showed higher fluorescence
quantum yields when compared to those of polyhydrazides
and polyoxadiazoles prepared from the same diacid.20(b) This
can be attributable to the fact that they consist of random am-
ide and hydrazide/oxadiazole sequence in the polymer main
chain which hinders close chain packing. Thus, the quenching
effect caused by chain aggregation in these polymers is
reduced. Furthermore, the 2 series PAHs and 3 series PAOXs
exhibited lower UPL when compared with the corresponding
20 series PAHs and 30 series PAOXs. This may be attributed to
the quenching effect arising from the p-p stacking interactions
by the pyrene rings. It is possible to enhance the quantum
yield by reducing the molar incorporation ratio of pyrene
rings. In order to further investigate the effect of the concen-
tration of pyrene ring on the PL quantum yield, we prepared
the copolymers from p-ABH or m-ABH with an equimolar mix-
ture of the pyrenylamine-based diacid 1 and 4,40-dicarboxydi-
phenyl ether (Scheme 2). As shown in Table 5, all the copoly-
mers revealed an enhanced quantum yield as compared to the
corresponding homopolymers. As a representative example,
the absorption and PL profiles of co-PAH m-4 and m-2 are
compiled in Figure 7. The dilute NMP solution of the copoly-
mer co-PAH m-4 exhibits a significantly increased quantum
yield (84.9%) in comparison with the homopolymer m-2
(58.4%).
Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical properties of the PAHs and PAOXs were
investigated by CV conducted for the cast films on an ITO-
coated glass substrate as working electrode in dry acetoni-
trile (CH3CN) (for the anodic scan) or DMF (for the cathodic

bearing PAH m-2 showed a quasi-reversible reduction wave
at Eonset ¼ 1.66 V (Epc ¼ 1.90 V), whereas its derived
PAOX m-3 displayed an additional peak at Epc ¼ 2.05 V
associated with the irreversible electroreduction reaction of
its oxadiazole moieties. The bandgaps of the PAHs and
PAOXs can be estimated from the difference of the onset
potentials of reduction and oxidation processes, ranging
from 2.70 to 2.73 eV. The electrochemical data were used to
estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy lev-
els (Table 6). The HOMO levels for these pyrene-containing
polymers were calculated to be between 5.38 and 5.41 eV
(relative to the vacuum energy level), whereas the values for
the LUMO levels lay between 2.66 and 2.70 eV.
Spectroelectrochemical and Electrochromic Properties
The spectroelectrochemical properties of the polymer thin
films were monitored by a UV–vis spectrometer at different
applied potentials. The electrode preparations and solution
conditions were identical to those used in CV. The electro-
chromic absorbance spectra of PAHs p-2 and p-20 upon elec-
tro-oxidation are illustrated in Figure 10. In the neutral state,
PAH p-2 exhibited strong absorption at 371 nm, characteris-
tic of triarylamine p-p* transitions, but it is almost transpar-
ent in the visible region. The optical bandgap of polymer p-2
was calculated as 2.80 eV from the onset of the p-p* transi-
tion. On electro-oxidation of the p-2 film (increasing applied

voltage from 0 to 1.46 V), the absorption of p-p* transition
at 371 nm gradually decreased, whereas new peaks at 548
and 588 nm gradually increased in intensity. The spectral
changes are assigned to the radical cation formation arising
from the oxidation of diphenylpyrenylamine core. The
observed electronic absorption changes in the film of p-2 at
various applied potentials are associated with strong color
changes. As can be seen in the inset of Figure 10, the film
changed from a pale yellow transparent neutral state to a
gray oxidized state. For comparison, the spectral changes of
the referenced PAH p-20 are also shown in Figure 10. When
the p-20 film was oxidized at 1.48 V, the intensity of the
absorption at 365 nm decreased, and a new broad absorp-
tion emerged in the visible region with maximum at 707 nm.
We attribute this spectral change to the formation of cation
radicals from the triphenylamine moieties in the polymer
backbone. The p-20 film turned into blue in the oxidized
state. However, these PAHs did not show good electrochro-
mic stability as that of the pyrenylamine-containing polya-
mides reported previously.23 The decreased stability of these
polymers can be explained by the fact that the carbonyl side
in their amide and hydrazide linkages are attached on the
triarylamino core, and thus the radical cations formed upon
electro-oxidation are destabilized.
The absorption spectral changes of PAOX p-3 upon electro-
oxidation (p-doping) are shown in Figure 11(a). In the neu-
tral state, this polymer exhibited strong absorption at around
380 nm, and its film appeared a very light yellow color
(nearly colorless). When the applied potential was stepwise
raised to 1.5 V, the absorption intensity in the UV region
gradually dropped, while a new double peak emerged in the
visible region with maxima at 548 and 590 nm, due to the
formation of radical cations in the main chain. Meanwhile,
the color of the polymer film turned into purplish-gray and
then to gray [as shown in Fig. 11(a), inset]. Figure 11(b)
presents the absorbance spectral changes in the film of
PAOX p-3 upon electrochemical reduction (n-doping). As the
film was charged with electrons at 1.95 V, the intensity of
the absorption at 380 nm slightly decreased, and the absorp-
tion in the region of 400–500 nm slightly intensified and
appeared as a shoulder around 450 nm and a small peak at
503 nm. At this fully reduced state, the polymer film turned
into orange-yellow.
CONCLUSIONS
New pyrenylamine-containing PAHs and PAOXs have been
successfully prepared from the diphenylpyrenylamine-based
dicarboxylic acid 1 with p-ABH and m-ABH, respectively. The
synthesized polymers exhibited good solubility, thin-film
formability, and high thermal stability. These polymers
showed strong blue PL in solution or thin solid films, with a
quantum yield up to 58.4% in dilute NMP solution. Reducing
50% of the pyrene concentration in the polymer chain could
further increase the quantum yield up to 84.9%. Additionally,
the polymers displayed ambipolar electrochemical and elec-
trochromic properties. Thus, the present PAHs and poly(am-
ide-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s may be used to fabricate optoelec-
tronic devices such as OLEDs and electrochromic devices.

ABSTRACT: A series of novel aromatic polyamides with
pyrenylamine in the backbone were prepared from a newly
synthesized dicarboxylic acid monomer, N,N-di(4-carboxy-
phenyl)-1-aminopyrene, and various aromatic diamines via the
phosphorylation polyamidation technique. These polyamides
were readily soluble in many organic solvents and could be
solution-cast into tough and amorphous films. They had useful
levels of thermal stability with glass-transition temperatures in
the range of 276–342 C and 10% weight loss temperatures in
excess of 500 C. The dilute N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) sol-
utions of these polymers exhibited fluorescence maxima
around 455–540 nm with quantum yields up to 56.9%. The
polyamides also showed remarkable solvatochromism of the
emission spectra. Their films showed reversible electrochemi-
cal oxidation and reduction accompanied by strong color
changes from colorless neutral state to purple oxidized state
and to yellow reduced state. The polyamide 4g containing the
pyrenylamine units in both diacid and diamine sides exhibited
easily accessible p- and n-doped states, together with multicol-
ored electrochromic behaviors. VC 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

INTRODUCTION Wholly aromatic polyamides (aramids) are
considered to be high-performance polymeric materials
because of their excellent thermal and oxidative stability, low
flammability, and superior mechanical properties.1 High-
modulus fibers of aramids were among the first high-
performance polymers to be commercialized.2 The most
important products were NomexV
R
[poly(m-phenyleneisoph-
thalamide)] and KevlarV
R
[poly(p-phenyleneterephthalamide)]
fibers commercialized by DuPont in the late 1960s. The stiff
polymer chains result not only in fibers with excellent me-
chanical properties but also in poor polymer solubility. The
limited solubility is attributed to the very small entropy
change during the dissolution process. The extremely high
transition temperatures of the commercial aramids and their
poor solubility in organic solvents lead to processing difficul-
ties and limit their applications. As a result, research efforts
have focused on enhancing their processability and solubility
to expand the scope of the technological applications of
these materials.3 In addition, there is currently a huge
research effort directed toward exploiting the special func-
tions of the polyamides by incorporating new chemical func-
tionalities in the main chain or in the lateral structure.4
Pyrene is one of the most useful fluorogenic units for fluo-
rescent sensors because it displays not only a well-defined
monomer emission but also an efficient excimer emission.5
In close enough proximity, an excited-state pyrene monomer
and ground-state monomer can form an excimer state that
fluoresces at a substantially longer wavelength than the
monomer emission. It has also been shown that the intensity
of the excimer emission can be enhanced by both inter- and
intramolecular aggregation of pyrene monomers due to a
greater probability of dimerization. The long fluorescence
lifetime, large Stokes shift, and tunable intensity of the exci-
mer make the pyrene unit a useful fluorophore labeling in
metal ion or nucleic acid probes.6 In recent years, pyrene
derivatives,7 polymers,8 starbursts,9 and dendrimers10 have
been reported in the context of organic electronic applica-
tions such as organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), because
of their emissive properties combined with high charge car-
rier mobility. Although pyrene is a blue-emitting chromo-
phore, the use of pyrene as emitting materials in OLED
applications has been limited because of the aggregation
between planar pyrene molecules. The high tendency toward
p-stacking of the pyrene moieties generally lends the pyrene-
containing emitters strong intermolecular interactions in the
solid state, which leads to a substantial red shift of their flu-
orescence emission and a decrease of the fluorescence quan-
tum yields. Nonetheless, through molecular structure design,
the close packing/fluorescence quenching effect in pyrene-
type materials can be reduced or controlled. For example, a
successful effort in the prevention of p-stacking in small

with stirring at 120 C for 3 h. The obtained polymer solu-
tion was poured slowly into 200 mL of stirred methanol giv-
ing rise to a stringy, fiber-like precipitate that was collected
by filtration, washed thoroughly with hot water and metha-
nol, and dried under vacuum at 100 C. Reprecipitations of
the polymer by DMAc/methanol were carried out twice for
further purification. The inherent viscosity of the obtained
polyamide 4a was 0.85 dL/g, measured at a concentration of
0.5 g/dL in 5 wt % LiCl DMAc at 30 C.

spectroscopic analyses were used to identify structures of the
intermediate dicyano compound 1 and the target dicarboxylic
acid monomer 2. The FTIR spectra of the synthesized com-
pounds are illustrated in the Supporting Information Figure
S1. The cyano groups of compound 1 gave characteristic
bands at 2218 cm1. After hydrolysis, the characteristic
absorptions of the cyano group disappeared, and the carbox-
ylic acid group showed the typical C¼O and OAH stretching
absorptions at 1682 and 2700–3200 cm1, respectively. The
NMR data of the intermediate dicyano compound 1 are
included in the Supporting Information Figure S2. The 1H,
13C, HAH COSY, and CAH HMQC NMR spectra of the target
diacid monomer 2 are compiled in Figure 1. Assignments of
each carbon and proton are also indicated in these spectra,
and they are in good agreement with the proposed structures
of these two compounds. The 13C NMR spectra confirm that
the cyano groups were completely transformed into the car-
boxylic acid groups by the disappearance of the resonance
peak for the cyano carbon at 118.9 pm and the appearance
of the carbonyl peak at 166.8 pm. Other important evidence
of this transformation is the shifting of the carbon resonance
signals of C20 adjacent to the cyano or carboxyl group. The
C20 of dicyano compound 1 resonated at a higher field (104.2
ppm) than the other aromatic carbons due to the anisotropic
shielding by the cyano p-electrons. After hydrolysis, the reso-
nance peak of C20 shifted to a lower field (124.2 ppm)
because of the lack of an anisotropic field. Thus, the spectro-
scopic data convincingly prove the successful synthesis of the
target dicarboxylic acid monomer.
Polymer Synthesis
According to the phosphorylation polyamidation technique
described by Yamazaki et al.,26 a series of novel aromatic
polyamides 4a–4g with main-chain DPPA units were synthe-
sized from the dicarboxylic acid monomer 2 with various
aromatic diamines 3a–3g via solution polycondensation
using TPP and pyridine as condensing agents (Scheme 2).
Diamines 3a–e were obtained from commercial sources,
whereas diamines 3f and 3g were synthesized according to
the reported procedures.23,25 All the polymerization reac-
tions proceeded homogeneously throughout the reaction
and gave clear and highly viscous polymer solutions. The
products precipitated in a tough, fiber-like form when the
resulting polymer solutions were slowly poured into stirring
methanol. As shown in Table 1, the obtained polyamides
had inherent viscosities in the range of 0.48–0.85 dL/g. The
transparent and tough films can be obtained through solu-
tion-casting process which indicated the moderate to high
molecular weight polyamides were achieved. For a compara-
tive purpose, four structurally related polyamides 5a–c and
5e (see the footnote in Table 1) were also prepared from
4,40-dicarboxytriphenylamine with the corresponding aro-
matic diamines in a similar synthetic procedure as that
used for the 4 series polyamides. The molecular weight
data of THF-soluble polyamides 4d and 4f were measured
by GPC using polystyrenes as standard with THF as solvent.
The Mw of polymers 4d and 4f were 32,500 and 45,000
with polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 2.03 and 1.88, respec-
tively. The structures of the polyamides could be affirmed
by IR and NMR spectroscopy. Supporting Information Figure
S3 shows a typical IR spectrum for polyamide 4a. The char-
acteristic IR absorption bands of the amide group appeared
at around 3311 cm1 (NAH stretch) and 1649 cm1 (amide
carbonyl). Supporting Information Figure S4 shows a typical
set of 1H and two-dimensional HAH COSY spectra of poly-
amide 4a in DMSO-d6. All the resonance peaks could be
readily assigned to the hydrogen atoms in the repeating
unit. The resonance signal appearing at 10.1 ppm in the 1H
NMR spectrum also supports the formation of amide
linkages.
Solubility and Film Property
The solubility behaviors of polyamides 4a–4g are also pre-
sented in Table 1. All the polymers were readily dissolved
in highly polar organic solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF,
and DMSO, attributed mainly to the introduction of bulky,
three-dimensional DPPA unit into the polymer backbone.
Polyamides 4d and 4f also showed good solubility in less
polar solvents such as THF because of the additional contri-
bution of the bulky trifluoromethyl (ACF3) groups and

Thermal Properties
The thermal stability and transition temperatures of the
polyamides were investigated by TGA, DSC, and TMA techni-
ques. A typical set of TGA and DSC curves of the representa-
tive polyamide 4g are shown in Figure 2, and the thermal
data of all polyamides are summarized in Table 2. These pol-
yamides show a high thermal stability; there is no obvious
weight loss before the scanning temperature reaches 450 C
in nitrogen or in air. Their decomposition temperatures (Td)
at a 10% weight loss in nitrogen and air were recorded at
504–576 C and 502–577 C, respectively. The amount of
carbonized residue (char yield) of these polymers was more
than 68% at 800 C in nitrogen atmosphere. The high char
yields of these polymers can be ascribed to their high aro-
matic content. The glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of the
4 series polyamides were observed in the range of 276–313
C by DSC. The lowest Tg value (276 C) of 4f can be
explained in terms of the decreased rotation barrier caused
by the flexible ether linkages together with the increased
free volume due to bulky pendent trifluoromethyl groups
and the laterally attached p-terphenyl structure in the dia-
mine component. As compared with the 5 series analogs, the
present series polyamides exhibit an increased Tg as a result
of the presence of rigid pyrene units. The Ts (may be
referred as apparent Tg) of the polymer films were deter-
mined by the TMA method using a loaded penetration probe.
They were read from the onset temperature of the probe
displacement on the TMA trace. The Ts values are also listed
in Table 2. In most cases, the Ts values of these polyamides
obtained by TMA are comparable to the Tg values measured
by the DSC experiments. The thermal analysis results reveal
that these polyamides exhibit high thermal stability, which in
turn is beneficial to increase the operational lifetime in de-
vice application and enhance the morphological stability to
the solution-processed films.
Absorption and Fluorescence Properties
The UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of the polya-
mides were measured in dilute NMP solutions (1  105
mol/L) and as thin solid films, and the pertinent data are
presented in Table 3. As shown in Figure 3, the absorption
maxima of polyamides 4a–4f lie in the range of 353–362 nm
primarily because of the p–p* transition and n–p* transitions
of the conjugated aromatic segments. Their emission maxima
were at around 455–458 nm in the blue region with fluores-
cence quantum yields (UFL) ranging from 33.0 to 56.9%.
When compared with the corresponding 5 series counter-
parts, the higher quantum efficiency of the present series

6(b)]. This oxidation process starting at about 0.71 V is re-
versible, indicating that the DPPA segment in the diamine
residue could form a stable radical cation due to its more
electron-rich nature. The second (Epa ¼ 1.5 V) oxidation peak
is related the electron loss from the DPPA segment in the
diacid component of polyamide 4g. Additionally, the cathodic
reduction wave originating from the pyrene unit corresponds
to a two-electron charging event because 4g contains the
DPPA segment in both diacid and diamine residues. From the
differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) of 4g shown in Figure
7(a) and the CV curves of the diamide model compounds M1
and M2 shown in Figure 7(b), we believe that the first reduc-
tion peak at Epc ¼ 1.85 V appears to involve one electron
charged into the pyrene unit of the diacid component, and
the second reduction peak at Epc ¼ 1.96 V arises from the
second electron charged into the pyrene unit of the diamine
component. However, these two reduction processes occurred
almost simultaneously at the CV scan rate we used. There-
fore, these two reduction waves merged and became in-
distinguishable in the CV diagram. Furthermore, a linear
dependence of the peak currents as a function of scan rates
confirmed both a nondiffusional redox process and a well-
adhered electroactive polymer film [Fig. 7(c,d)]. Because of
the stability of the films and good adhesion between the
polymer and ITO-glass substrate, 4g exhibited good redox
stability during the first oxidation process.
On the basis of the oxidation and reduction onset potentials,
the bandgaps for polyamides 4a–4f were calculated, and were
found to vary from 2.76 to 2.79 eV. The bandgaps calculated
from the CV measurements are somewhat lower (by 0.09–
0.31 eV) than those obtained from the absorption spectra. By
using the oxidation and reduction onset potentials, the HOMO
levels for these polyamides were calculated and found to be
5.36–5.38 eV (relative to the vacuum energy level), whereas
the values for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) levels lay between 2.58 and 2.61 eV (Table 4), which
are similar to those reported for the pyrene-containing triaryl-
amines. As expected, the polyamide 4g possesses a higher
HOMO energy (5.07 eV) and a smaller bandgap (2.43 eV)
when compared with the 4a–f series. The relevant data for
polyamide 4g are consistent with those reported previously
for 40a–d. This also suggests that attaching the carbonyl side
of the amide linkage on the para positions of the DPPA phenyl
units in the present polyamides results in a decrease in
HOMO energy and an increase in bandgap.
Spectroelectrochemical and Electrochromic Properties
Spectroelectrochemical measurements were tested on films
of polymers drop-coated onto ITO-coated glass slides
immerged in electrolyte solution. The electrode preparations
and solution condition were identical to those used in the
CV experiments. The UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra of

(complete cycle time is 22 s) between 0 and 1.0 V. The
response time was calculated at 90% of the full-transmit-
tance change because it is difficult to perceive any further
color change with naked eye beyond this point. Polyamide
4g attained 90% of a complete coloring and bleaching switch
in less than 4 s (3.8 s for coloring) and 2 s (1.6 s for bleach-
ing), respectively. As shown in Figure 10(a,b), the absorbance
changes at 834 nm reflect the switch in current, and the
kinetics of the charge transport process can be referenced to
the coloration response time. Coloration efficiency (CE; g) is
a useful term for measuring the power efficiency of the elec-
trochromic devices and can be calculated via optical density
using the following equation:28
g ¼ DODðkmaxÞ=Q
where Q is the injected/extracted charge per unit electrode
area (mC/cm2) and DOD is the change in absorbance at a
specific wavelength maximum during a redox step. The CE
for the 4g film at 834 nm was calculated to be 112 cm2/C.
The long-term stability of polyamides 4g was investigated by
monitoring the electrochromic contrast (D%T) of the thin
films on repeated squarewave potential steps of 11 s in a
0.1 M Bu4NClO4/CH3CN electrolyte solution between 0 and
1.0 V. In more than 100 cycles under ambient conditions,
polyamide 4g showed a variation of electrochromic contrast
of less than 1%, whereas the CE exhibited decay of about
3.6% [Fig. 10(c,d)]. Therefore, the electrochromic switching
behavior appears to be highly reversible during the first oxi-
dation process of this polyamide.
Electrochromic Device
On the basis of the foregoing results, it can be concluded
that these polyamides can be used in the construction of
electrochromic devices and optical display due to the fast
response time and the robustness of the polymers. There-
fore, we fabricated as preliminary investigations single layer
elecrochromic cells (Fig. 11). As a typical example, an elec-
trochromic cell based on polyamide 4g was fabricated. When
the voltage applied was increased (to a maximum of 3.0 V),
the color changed from pale yellow to light gray then to
dark purplish-gray, similar to those observed for the solution
spectroelectrochemistry experiments. We believe that optimi-
zation could further improve the device performance and
fully explore the potential of these multicolored electrochro-
mic polyamides.
CONCLUSIONS
A series of novel pyrenylamine-functionalized aromatic poly-
amides have been prepared from a newly synthesized diacid
monomer, N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)-1-aminopyrene, with var-
ious aromatic diamines via the phosphorylation polyamida-
tion reaction. All the polymers could form morphologically
stable and uniform amorphous films using simple solution-
casting techniques. They also showed high Tg and good
thermal stability. When comparing with the analogous poly-
amides based on N,N-di(4-aminophenyl)-1-aminopyrene, the
present series polyamides displayed a blue-shifted emission
in the deep blue region together with an enhanced fluores-
cence quantum efficiency. Reported properties prove that the
polyamides are multifunctional materials which may find
optoelectronic applications in OLEDs and electrochromic
devices.

New aromatic polyhydrazides bearing redox-active pyrenylamine unit were prepared from the
polycondensation reactions of N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)-1-aminopyrene with terephthalic dihydrazide
(TPH) and isophthalic dihydrazide (IPH), respectively, via the phosphorylation reaction. These two
hydrazide polymers could be further cyclodehydrated into the corresponding oxadiazole polymers in
the range of 300–400 C in the solid state. The resulting poly(1,3,4-oxdiazole)s had high glass-transition
temperatures (298–304 C) and high thermal stability (10% weight-loss temperature in excess of
520 C). The dilute solutions of all the hydrazide and oxadiazole polymers showed a medium to high
fluorescence with emission maxima around 457–545 nm in the blue to yellowish-green region. The
polymer films revealed one redox couples upon electrochemical oxidation, together with interesting
electrochromic behaviors: color changes from pale yellow neutral state to pale green oxidized states.
Additionally, cyclic voltammetry studies of the oxadiazole polymers also showed reduction processes
accompanied by strong color changes from pale yellow to orange, red or deep blue due to the formation
of radical anions of the oxadiazole and pyrene units.
Introduction
Aromatic polyoxadiazoles are known for their excellent thermal
and hydrolytic stability.1 The best known one is poly(p-pheny-
lene-1,3,4-oxadiazole), which is used to produce heat-resistant
Oxalon fiber in the Soviet Union.2 However, aromatic poly-
oxadiazoles are generally difficult to process owing to their
infusible and insoluble properties. Nonetheless, this kind of
polymers can be synthesized via the preparation of a poly-
hydrazide as a soluble precursor polymer, by the reaction of
dihydrazides of dicarboxylic acids with dicarboxylic acids or
diacid chlorides followed by cyclization to the corresponding
polyoxadiazoles by heating at elevated temperatures or by
heating in dehydrating solvents.3 It has also been demonstrated
that incorporation of flexible linkages like aryl ether and/or
solubilizing groups such as hexafluoroisopropylidene and
phthalide into the polyoxadiazole backbone or attachment of
alkoxy pendent groups leads to an enhanced solubility in organic
solvents while still retained desirable mechanical and thermal
properties.4 On the other hand, oxadiazole derivatives are well-
known electron-transporting materials used in organic light-
emitting diodes (OLEDs).5 In recent years, the use of
light-emitting conjugated polymers in electroluminescent devices
has received a great deal of scientific and industrial attention
because of several appealing advantages over other technolo-
gies.6 Electron-deficient oxadiazole units have been found to be
efficient in promoting electron-transport properties when they
are incorporated into conjugated polymer main chains or
attached as side groups. Thus, 1,3,4-oxadiazole-containing
conjugated polymers have been widely investigated and applied
as electron-transport or emission layers in OLEDs.7
Pyrene is one of the most useful fluorogenic units for fluores-
cent sensors because it displays not only a well-defined monomer
emission but also an efficient excimer emission.8 In close enough
proximity, an excited-stated pyrene monomer and a ground-state
monomer can form an excimer state that fluoresces at
a substantially longer wavelength than the monomer emission. It
has also been shown that the intensity of the excimer emission
can be enhanced by both inter- and intramolecular aggregation
of pyrene monomers due to a greater probability of dimerization.
The long fluorescence lifetime, large Stokes shift, and tunable
intensity of the excimer make the pyrene unit a useful fluo-
rophore labeling in metal ion or nucleic acid probes.9 In recent
years, pyrene derivatives,10 polymers,11 starbursts,12 and den-
drimers13 have been reported in the context of organic electronic
applications such as organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), due
to their emissive properties combined with high charge carrier
mobility.
On the other hand, triarylamine derivatives are widely used as
hole-transporters, light-emitters, and host materials for electro-
phosphorescent OLEDs.14,15 Oligomers and/or polymers

with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were carried out
on approximately 3–5 mg film samples heated in flowing nitrogen
or air (flow rate ¼ 20 cm3 min1) at a heating rate of 20 C min1.
DSC analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 DSC at
a scan rate of 20 C min1 in flowing nitrogen (20 cm3 min1).
Absorption spectra were measured with an Agilent 8453 UV-
visible diode array spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL)
spectra were measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer. The fluorescent quantum yield was deter-
mined using solutions in NMP and was calculated by comparing
emission with that of a standard solution of 9,10-diphenylan-
thracene in cyclohexane (FPL ¼ 90%) at room temperature.
Electrochemistry was performed with a CH Instruments 611C

electrode. A platinum wire was used as an auxiliary electrode. All
cell potentials were taken with the use of a home-made Ag/AgCl,
KCl (sat.) reference electrode. Ferrocene was used as an external
reference for calibration (+0.44 V vs.Ag/AgCl). Voltammograms
are presented with the positive/negative potential pointing to the

were carried out with an electrolytic cell, which was composed of
a 1 cm cuvette, ITO as a working electrode, a platinum wire as an
auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
Absorption spectra in the spectroelectrochemical experiments
were also measured with an Agilent 8453 UV-visible diode array

Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis
A two-step procedure was employed to obtain the poly(1,3,4-
oxadiazole)s from the dicarboxylic acid monomer 1 with TPH
and IPH by using the phosphorylation technique described by
Higashi and coworkers23 (Scheme 1). The first stage consists of
the synthesis of hydrazide prepolymers which are converted to
the corresponding oxadiazole polymers in the second stage by the
thermal cyclodehydration of the hydrazide group into the 1,3,4-
oxadiazole ring. In the first stage, the polymerization proceeded
homogeneously throughout the reaction and afforded viscous
polymer solutions. All the hydrazide prepolymers precipitated in
a fiber-like form when slowly pouring the resulting polymer
solutions into methanol. The obtained hydrazide polymers had
inherent viscosities in the range of 0.35–0.38 dL g1 (as shown in
Table 1) and could be solution-cast into freestanding or flexible
films, indicating the formation of moderate to high molecular
weight polymers. IR and 1HNMR spectroscopic techniques were
used to identify the structures of the synthesized hydrazide
polymers. The 1H NMR and H–H COSY spectra included in
Fig. 1 confirm the correct structure of polymer I-IPH. The
representative IR spectrum for I-IPH (Fig. S3, ESI†) shows the
characteristic absorption bands of the hydrazide group at around
1655 (carbonyl stretching) and 3261 cm1 (N–H stretching).
Thermal conversion of the hydrazide group to the 1,3,4-oxa-
diazole ring was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The typical IR
spectra for the representative polyhydrazide I-IPH and poly
(1,3,4-oxadiazole) II-IPH are illustrated in Fig. S3, ESI†. After
thermally curing at 350 C for 3 h, the complete conversion from
I-TPH to II-TPH could be confirmed by the disappearance of the
absorption bands peculiar to the hydrazide group at 3261 and
1655 cm1, and the appearance of characteristic 1,3,4-oxadiazole
ring vibration at around 1487, 1601 (C]N stretching), and
1071 cm1 (C–O–C stretching). The experiment conditions for
the cyclization were selected on the basis of the weight loss
behavior observed by dynamic TGA and the cyclodehydration
endotherm on the DSC thermogram. A typical pair of DSC and
TGA curves of polyhydrazide I-TPH and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)
II-TPH are illustrated in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†), respectively. The
main endothermic peak on the DSC curve and the weight loss at
the first stage of the TGA thermogram reveal that the cyclo-
dehydration reaction of hydrazide group with water evolution
occurred in the range of 290–380 C. The chemical compositions
of the thermally converted oxadiazole polymers were also
confirmed by the elemental analysis results listed in Table S1,
ESI†.
Organo-solubility and film property
The solubility properties of all the polymers are also included in
Table 1. All the hydrazide polymers were soluble in various
solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF, DMSO, andm-cresol, and
the good solubility could be attributed in part to the introduction

the backbone. The decreased FPL of the polyoxadiazoles II with
respect to polyhydrazides I also could be attributable to the
quenching effect caused by the intermolecular charge transfer
between the diphenylpyrenylamine donor and the oxadiazole
acceptor. Although these polymers exhibited a low FPL, their
thin solid films showed an obvious green or blue PL when irra-
diated by a standard laboratory UV lamp (see the images shown
in the top of Fig. 2). The highest FPL (50.9%) of polyhydrazide I-
IPH can be rationalized by the decreasing charge transfer effect
caused by the meta-catenation of IPH. Furthermore, I series
polyhydrazides exhibited higher FPL compared with I
0 series.
This could be attributed to the incorporation of highly fluores-
cent pyrene chromophores. In addition, most of the polymers
exhibited a prominent red-shifted emission in the solid state as
compared to that measured in NMP solutions, possibly due to an
increased interchain interaction in the film form.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the hydrazide and oxadiazole
polymers were investigated by CV conducted for the cast films on
an ITO-coated glass substrate as working electrode in dry
acetonitrile (CH3CN) (for the anodic scan) or DMF (for the
cathodic scan) containing 0.1 M of Bu4NClO4 as an electrolyte
under nitrogen atmosphere. The onset oxidation and reduction
potentials are summarized in Table 4. The typical CV diagrams
for the representative polyhydrazide I-TPH and poly(1,3,4-
oxadiazole) II-TPH are illustrated in Fig. 3. An irreversible
oxidation process (Fig. 3a), corresponding to the removal of an
electron from the diphenylpyrenylamine unit, was detected at
Eonset ¼ 1.05 V (Epa ¼ 1.50 V) in the CV of I-TPH. This polymer
also had a quasi-reversible reduction wave at Eonset ¼ 1.62 V
(Epc ¼ 1.94 V) due to the pyrene unit. The oxidation wave for
II-TPH shifted to a higher potential (Eonset ¼ 1.08 V, Epa ¼
1.60 V) attributable to the electron-deficient 1,3,4-oxadiazole. In
addition, well-defined reduction waves for the formation of
radical anion and dianion of the oxadiazole units (Fig. 3b) were
observed in the negative side of the voltammogram at E1/2 ¼
1.56 and 2.05 V, respectively. Another reduction couple (at
E1/2 ¼ 1.88 V) observed in the CV curve of II-TPH can be
attributable to the reduction of pyrene moiety. As shown in
Fig. S6 (ESI†), the dihydrazide monomers IPH and TPH show
no electrochemical activity in the applied voltage range. Thus,
the possible mechanisms of electro-oxidation and reduction of
the diphenylpyrenylamine and oxadiazole moieties are proposed
in Scheme 2. The band gaps of the polyhydrazides and poly
(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s can be estimated from the difference in the
onset potentials of reduction and oxidation processes, ranging
from 2.56 to 2.75 eV. The electrochemical data were used to
estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels
(Table 4). The HOMO levels for these poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s
were calculated to be between 5.44 and 5.46 eV (relative to the

spectral changes as those observed for I-TPH. Moreover,
coloration changes were also observed in these polyhydrazides
upon reduction. However, the color change is not strong as that
observed in the anodic scanning.
Fig. 5 presents the absorbance spectral changes in the film of
polyoxadiazole II-TPH upon electrochemical oxidation and
reduction. In the neutral form the film exhibits strong bands at
320 and 399 nm due to the p–p* transitions, but it is almost
transparent at longer than 450 nm. Upon oxidation of the II-
TPH film (increasing electrode potential from 0 to 1.6 V), the
intensity of the absorption bands in the UV region gradually
decreased while a new small peak in the visible region at 602 nm
together with a broad band from 500 nm extending out into the
NIR region gradually increased in intensity (Fig. 5a). Mean-
while, the film changed from pale yellow to pale green. We can
suggest that these spectral changes are attributed to the electron
removal from the diphenylpyrenylamine unit. Fig. 5b shows the
spectral changes in the II-TPH film upon reduction. As the film
was charged with electrons at 1.00 to 1.75 V, the intensity of
the absorbance in the UV region decreased significantly, and
a new strong band grew up in the visible region with maximum at
490 nm together with a broad band from 650 nm extending out
into the NIR region beyond 1100 nm gradually increased in
intensity. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5b, the film at this reduced
form appeared orange in color. As the potential was continu-
ously decreased to2.15 V, the intensity of the absorbance in the
UV region further dropped, at the same time the peak at 490 nm
slightly shifted to longer wavelength (509 nm) with an increasing
intensity. At this fully reduced state, the polymer film turned into
orange-red.
Upon oxidation, the film of poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole) II-IPH
showed a similar spectroelectrochemical behavior to that of II-
TPH. However, its electro-optical property is quite different
from that of II-TPH during the cathodic scanning. Fig. 6 shows
the spectral changes in the II-IPH film when it was switched for
n-doping. When the potential is 0.0 V, the polymer was at the
neutral state, where the film had strong absorption in the UV
region with a peak centered at 385 nm. It was almost transparent
in the visible region. As the film was charged with electrons at
potentials between 1.40 and 1.80 V, the intensity of the peak
in the UV region decreased, and a new peak appeared in the
visible region at 502 nm together with a broad band from 550 to
750 nm gradually increasing in intensity. As shown in the inset of
Fig. 6b, the film of this electron charged state is light gray in
color. With the potential continuously reduced to 2.05 V, the
intensity of the peak at 385 nm further decreased, and the peak at
502 nm increased in intensity significantly together with an
intensified shoulder around 612 nm. As the potential was
switched from 1.80 to 2.05 V, the polymer film changed from
light gray to blue. Referring to the CV data in Fig. 6a, we can
suggest that the peak at 502 nm is associated with the polaron on
the oxadiazole segment, and the peak at 612 nm is related to the
polaron on the pyrene segment.
Conclusions
Two new aromatic polyhydrazides were prepared from a newly
synthesized dicarboxylic acid 1with terephthalic dihydrazide and
isophthalic dihydrazide, respectively, via the Yamazaki–Higashi
phosphorylation reaction. Subsequent thermal cyclodehydration
of these hydrazide polymers gave the corresponding poly(1,3,4-
oxadiazole)s. These polymers exhibited blue or yellowish green
fluorescence emission maximum between 457 and 545 nm in
NMP solution with a quantum yield of up to 50.9%. The poly
(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s exhibited ambipolar electrochemical and
electrochromic properties. Thus, these novel polyhydrazides
and poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s may find applications in OLED and
electrochromic devices due to their excellent thermal stability,
medium to strong fluorescence, stable electrochemical redox
behavior, and multicolored electrochromic properties.

ABSTRACT: A series of novel polyimides based on N,N-di(4-ami-
nophenyl)-1-aminopyrene and aromatic or alicyclic tetracarbox-
ylic dianhydrides were synthesized. The polymers exhibited
good solubility in many polar organic solvents and could
afford robust films via solution casting. The polyimides derived
from aromatic dianhydrides exhibited high thermal stability
and high glass-transition temperatures (333–364 C). Cyclic vol-
tammetry studies of the polymer films showed that these poly-
imides are both p and n dopable and have multicolored
electrochromic states. For the polyimides derived from alicyclic
dianhydrides, they revealed a strong blue-light emission with
high fluorescence quantum yields (UPL > 45%) and a marked
solvatochromic behavior. VC 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

INTRODUCTION Aromatic polyimides are characterized as
highly thermally stable polymers with a favorable balance of
physical and chemical properties. They are commercially im-
portant materials used extensively as dielectric films and
coatings in a wide range of high technology applications.1
However, rigidity of the backbone and strong interchain
interactions result in high melting or glass-transition temper-
atures (Tg) and limited solubility in most organic solvents.
Thus, polyimide processing is generally carried out via poly-
(amic acid) precursor and then converted to polyimide by
vigorous thermal or chemical cyclodehydration. This process
has inherent problems such as emission of volatile by-prod-
ucts and storage instability of poly(amic acid) solution. To
overcome these problems, many attempts have been made to
the synthesis of soluble and processable polyimides in fully
imidized form while maintaining their excellent properties.2
The majority of methods used for improving the solubility
while maintaining the high-temperature performance of poly-
imides have involved the structural modifications of dianhy-
dride and diamine monomers. Typical approaches include
the introduction of flexible linkages, kinked or unsymmetri-
cal structures, bulky packing-disruptive units, and bulky lat-
eral groups into the polymer backbone.3
Pyrene is a flat aromatic molecule with four fused benzene
rings. Among the attractive properties of pyrene is its ready
functionalization, appearance of delayed fluorescence, dis-
tinct solvatochromic phenomena, and its high propensity for
forming excimers.4 Pyrene and its derivatives have been
extensively studied for application as fluorescence probes in
many applications.5 In recent years, pyrene derivatives,6
polymers,7 starbursts,8 and dendrimers9 have been reported
in the context of organic electronic applications such as or-
ganic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), due to their emissive
properties combined with high charge carrier mobility.
Although pyrene is a blue-emitting chromophore, the use of
pyrene as emitting materials in OLED applications has been
limited due to aggregation between planar pyrene molecules.
The high tendency toward p-stacking of the pyrene moieties
generally lends the pyrene-containing emitters strong inter-
molecular interactions in the solid state, which leads to a
substantial red shift of their fluorescence emission and a
decrease of the fluorescence quantum yields. Fortunately,
through molecular structure design, the close packing/fluo-
rescence quenching effect in pyrene-type materials can be
reduced or controlled. For example, a successful effort in the
prevention of p-stacking in small molecules was achieved
with 1,3,6,8-tetrasubstituted highly sterically hindered pyr-
enes10 that can emit blue light in solution as well as in the
solid state with a high-efficient yield. Additionally, diaryl-
amino-functionalized pyrene derivatives have been found to
perform efficiently as emitters and charge transport materi-
als in OLEDs.11
Triarylamines are an important class of compounds because
they form stable aminium radical cations. Thus, triarylamines

ments, see Supporting Information Fig. S7): 7.22–7.27 (two
overlapped AB doublets, 8H, Hj þ Hk), 7.83 (d, 2H, Hn), 7.90

8.19–8.22 (t, 2H, Hg þ Hb).
For the chemical imidization method, 4 mL of acetic anhy-
dride and 2 mL of Py were added to the poly(amic acid) so-
lution obtained by a similar process as above, and the mix-
ture was heated at 100 C for 1 h to effect a complete
imidization. The homogenous polymer solution was poured
slowly into 200 mL of stirring methanol giving rise to yellow
precipitate that was collected by filtration, washed thor-
oughly with hot water and methanol, and dried. A polymer
solution was made by the dissolution of about 0.5 g of the
polyimide sample in 10 mL of hot DMAc. The homogeneous
solution was poured into a 9-cm glass Petri dish, which was
placed in a 90 C oven overnight for the slow release of the
solvent, and then the film was stripped off from the glass
substrate and further dried in vacuum at 160 C for 6 h.
Measurements
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 FTIR
spectrometer, and the 1H and 13C NMR spectra on a 500
MHz instrument (Bruker AVANCE-500 FT-NMR system) using
DMSO-d6 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal
standard. Elemental analyses were run in a Heraeus VarioEL-
III CHNS elemental analyzer. The inherent viscosities of the
polymers were determined at 0.5 g dL1 concentration using
an Ubbelohde viscometer at 30 C. Weight-average molecular
weights (Mw) and number-average molecular weights (Mn)
were obtained via gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
based on polystyrene calibration using Waters 2410 as an
apparatus and THF as the eluent. Wide-angle X-ray diffrac-
tion (WAXD) measurements were performed at room tem-
perature (ca. 25 C) on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffrac-
tometer (40 kV, 20 mA), using graphite-monochromatized
Cu-Ka radiation. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were
conducted with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA, at a heating rate
of 20 C min1 in flowing nitrogen or air (flow rate ¼ 20
cm3 min1). DSC analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer
Pyris 1 differential scanning calorimeter at a scan rate of 20
C min1 under nitrogen. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra
of the polymer films were recorded on an Agilent 8453 UV–
visible spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were
measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectro-
photometer. Solution fluorescence quantum yields (UPL) of
the samples in NMP were determined by using the method
of Demas and Crosby21 with 9,10-diphenylanthracene in
cyclohexane (1  105 M) as a reference (UPL ¼ 90%).
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out
using a CH instruments model 600C potentiostat. Conven-
tional three electrodes assembly was used under nitrogen to
record cyclic voltammograms. The working electrode was an
ITO-coated glass electrode. The counter-electrode was a plat-
inum wire, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode.
The scan rate was 100 mV s1. The 0.1 M tetrabutylammo-
nium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) in anhydrous acetonitrile
(CH3CN) or DMF was used as a supporting electrolyte. Ferro-
cene was used as an external reference for calibration
(þ0.48 V vs. Ag/AgCl). For the spectroelectrochemical
experiments, the polymer film was cast on an ITO-coated
glass slide (a piece that fit in the commercial UV–visible cuv-
ette), and a homemade electrochemical cell was built from a
commercial UV–visible cuvette. The cell was placed in the
optical path of the sample light beam in an Agilent 8453
UV–visible diode array spectrophotometer. The electronic
absorption spectra of the polymer film on the ITO-glass were
recorded under potential control in a 0.1 M Bu4NClO4/
CH3CN or DMF solution.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Synthesis and Basic Characterization of Polyimides
A series of novel polyimides 3a–3h with main-chain diphe-
nylpyrenylamine units were prepared in conventional two-
step method by the reactions of equal molar amounts of dia-
mine 1 with various aromatic or alicyclic dianhydrides (2a–
2h) to form poly(amic acid)s, followed by the thermal or
chemical cyclodehydration (Scheme 1). As shown in Support-
ing Information Table S1, the inherent viscosities of the poly-
(amic acid) precursors derived from aromatic dianhydrides
2a–2f were in the range 1.46–2.02 dL g1. The molecular
weights of these poly(amic acid)s were sufficiently high to
permit the casting of flexible and tough poly(amic acid)
films, which were subsequently converted into tough poly-
imide films by stage-by-stage heating to elevated tempera-
tures. The transformation from poly(amic acid) to a poly-
imide could also be carried out via chemical cyclodehydration
by using acetic anhydride and Py. Polyimides 3d–3f were
soluble in polar solvents such as NMP and DMAc. Therefore,
the characterization of solution viscosity was carried out with-
out any difficulty. The inherent viscosities of polyimides 3d–f
were recorded in the range of 0.48–0.66 dL g1, as measured
in DMAc at 30 C. The 6FDA-derived polyimide 3f was also
soluble in less polar THF. The GPC measurement of this polyi-
mide using THF as the eluent showed weight-average molecu-
lar weight (Mw) of 75,000 and polydispersity index (Mw/Mn)
of 1.53, relative to polystyrene standards. Less favorable
results were obtained from the reactions of diamine 1 with al-
icyclic dianhydrides such as CPDA (2g) and BODA (2h). The
poly(amic acid) precursors of polyimides 3g and 3h were pro-
duced with a relatively lower inherent viscosity of 0.19 and
0.21 dL g1, respectively, and they could not afford flexible
films upon solution casting. However, adherent solid films
could be cast on the glass substrate from the NMP or DMAc
solutions of polyimides 3g and 3h. Structural features of these
polyimides were characterized by IR and NMR analysis. A typ-
ical set of IR spectra for polyimide 3f and its poly(amic acid)
precursor are presented in the Supporting Information Figure
S6. All polyimides exhibited characteristic imide group absorp-
tions around 1785 and 1720 cm1 (typical of imide carbonyl
asymmetrical and symmetrical stretch), 1380 cm1 (CAN

decomposition temperatures (Td) at a 10% weight-loss of
the aromatic polyimides (3a to 3f) in nitrogen and air were
recorded in the range of 587–631 and 577–614 C, respec-
tively. The amount of carbonized residue (char yield) of
these polymers was more than 68% at 800 C in nitrogen.
The high char yields of these polymers can be ascribed to
their high aromatic content. The polyimides 3g and 3h in
these series exhibited a lower Td value as compared with
3a–3f obtained from aromatic dianhydrides. This is reasona-
ble when considering the less stable aliphatic segments and
low molecular weights. Because of the incorporation of ther-
mally stable pyrene unit, all the polymers exhibited higher
Td values compared to their corresponding 30 series counter-
parts derived from 4,40-diaminotriphenylamine. These poly-
imides not only showed good thermal stability but also pos-
sessed remarkably high glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of
281–364 C. The lowest Tg value of 3g is expected and can
be explained in terms of the less stiff cyclopentane segments
in its backbone. As compared to the 30 series analogs, the
present series polyimides exhibit a remarkably increased Tg
as a result of the presence of rigid pyrene units. Thus, the
thermal analysis results revealed that these polyimides, espe-
cially for the aromatic ones, exhibited excellent thermal sta-
bility, which in turn is beneficial to increase the service time
in device application and enhance the morphological stability
to the spin-coated film.
Absorption and Fluorescence
All the polyimides were examined by UV–vis absorption and
PL spectroscopy in both solution and the solid state. The rel-
evant absorption and PL data are collected in Table 2. The
absorption and PL profiles of some representative poly-
imides 3d, 3f, 3g, and 3h in dilute NMP solution are shown
in Figure 2. In the absorption spectra, all the polyimides dis-
play two prominent bands with unsymmetrical shape and
adjoining shoulders. The most bathochromically shifted tran-
sitions at about 380 nm may be ascribed to that originating
from the amine to pyrene and amine to imide intramolecular
charge-transfer (CT) states. The strong high-energy absorp-
tion bands at about 325 nm are mainly assigned to that aris-
ing from pyrene-based p–p* transitions. Solid state absorp-
tion spectra of these polyimides were very similar to those
observed in the solution state (Fig. 3), suggesting that the
aryl rings do not undergo close p-stacking. These polyimides
in dilute NMP solution emitted deep blue to cyan fluores-
cence; their emission maxima lie in the region between 419
and 479 nm. The PL quantum yields (UPL) of these polyi-
mides in NMP solution were found to vary from 0.20 to
54.3%. The low UPL of the aromatic polyimides 3a–3f may
be attributed to the quenching effect arising from intra- and
inter-chain CT complexing between the diphenylpyrenyl-
amine donor and the phthalimide acceptor. It is worth noting
that CT-inhibited polyimide 3g and 3h derived from alicyclic
dianhydrides CPDA (2g) and BODA (2h) had a much higher
PL quantum yield of 45.1 and 54.3%. A relatively higher
quantum yield of polyimide 3h (UPL ¼ 54.3%) in

emission spectra of 3h show strong solvent-polarity depend-
ence, revealing a dominant broad emission band that under-
goes remarkable bathochromic shifts with an increase of the
solvent polarity. The emission color changes from deep blue
in toluene (kmax ¼ 455 nm) to cyan in DMSO (kmax ¼ 478
nm). A decreased fluorescence quantum yield and an
increased band width were also observed in the solvent of
higher polarity. It is reasonable that the model compound
M2 showed a higher PL quantum yield and larger bathochro-
mic shift (442 to 482 nm) as compared with polyimide 3h
(Table 3). The solvatochromism could be attributed to the
fast intramolecular CT process resulting in a large change of
dipole moment in the excited state. Such solvatochromic
behavior is associated with the stabilization of the polar
emissive excited states by the polar solvents.
Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical behavior of each polyimide was investi-
gated by CV using a conventional three-electrode cell assem-
bly. The CV diagrams of the 3a–h series polyimides are
depicted in Figure 5, and quantitative details are summar-
ized in Table 4. Redox reactions for the pyrenylamine group
and some selected diimide systems shown in Scheme 2 rep-
resent a possible distribution of electron density for the oxi-
dized or reduced forms and describe by other resonance
forms, which contribute to the charge delocalization. Reduc-
tion of the imide groups may induce increased quinoid char-
acter due to charge separation by the ring structure to mini-
mize the electron–electron repulsion.
All the polyimides underwent a reversible one-electron oxi-
dation and reduction originating from the ambipolar pyrenyl-
amine segment (see Fig. 5 and Scheme 2). The oxidation and
reduction peak potentials (Epa and Epc) of the pyrenylamine
units in these polyimides were observed in the range of 1.26
 1.38 V and 1.92  2.16 V, respectively. As shown in Ta-
ble 4, the oxidation onset potentials (Eonsetox ) and half-wave
potentials (E1=2ox ) were recorded in the range of 0.92–0.97 V
and 1.09–1.13 V, which are slightly lower than those of the
corresponding 30 counterparts. The decreased oxidation
potentials of these polymers should be a result of the incor-
poration of the electron-rich pyrene moiety. The polyimides
(3a–3f) based on aromatic dianhydrides exhibited additional
one, two or three quasi-reversible one-electron reduction
peaks due to different aryl imide structures. The CV curve of
PMDA polyimide 3a [Fig. 5(a)] shows that the pyromelliti-
mide groups undergo two quasi-reversible one-electron
reductions, which occurred at Epc ¼ 1.00 and 1.48 V. The
first reduction corresponds to formation of radical anions,
and the second reduction relates to formation of dianions
(see Scheme 2).23 Similar result was observed with the
BPDA polyimide 3b [Fig. 5(b)]; however, the first reduction
process (Epc ¼ 1.23 V) occurred at a more negative poten-
tial than observed for the PMDA polyimide 3a. Two sepa-
rated reduction peaks peculiar to the BPDA diimide segment
indicate a facile electronic communication between the two
phthalimide groups. It is worth to note that the benzophe-
none diimide group of the BTDA polyimide 3c revealed three
reversible redox couples [Fig. 5(c)], similar to those obtained
for the conventional BTDA polyimide and diimide model
compound.24 It was proposed that the first two electroreduc-
tion processes occur for the BTDA diimide units, leading to
the radical-anion (Epc ¼ 1.10 V) and diradical-dianion form
(Epc ¼ 1.34 V), respectively. The benzophenone moiety
allows a third electroreduction to the proposed radical–trian-
ion form (Epc ¼ 1.86 V; E1/2 ¼ 1.75 V) as depicted in
Scheme 2. Only one pair of redox waves was observed for
the imide reduction of ODPA polyimide 3d [Fig. 5(d)] and
6FDA polyimide 3f [Fig. 5(f)] during the negative CV scan-
ning, indicating that the conjugation across the imide is in-
terrupted by the ether and hexafluoroisopropylidene bridges.
If two phthalimide groups were connected by a nonconju-
gated bridge, the generated radicals in each part could not
be coupled to form a more stable quinoid dianion. With
ether or hexafluoroisopropylidene as the connector, reduc-
tion of each phthalimide group occurred at nearly the same
position. However, the DSDA polyimide 3e revealed two im-
ide reduction peaks [Fig. 5(e)], even though the conjugation
across the imide group is disrupted by the sulfonyl linker.
The reason is unkown at this stage and further study is
needed. For the polyimides 3g and 3h derived from alicyclic

at 2.05 V has a new peak appearing at 506 nm, together
with further intensified absorptions around 641 and 865
nm. As the potential examined is similar to the third ca-
thodic process, the spectral change is assigned to the radical
anion formation arising from the reduction of the pyrene
unit. At this stage, the polymer film appears as a cyan color.
Electrochromic switching studies for the polyimides were
performed to monitor the percent transmittance changes
(D%T) as a function of time at their absorption maximum
(kmax) and to determine the response time by stepping
potential repeatedly between the neutral and oxidized states.
The active area of the polymer film on ITO glass is about 1
cm2. Figure 8 depicts the optical transmittance as a function
of time at 549 and 594 nm by applying squarewave potential
steps of 4 s between 0.5 and þ1.30 V. The response time
was calculated at 90% of the full-transmittance change,
because it is difficult to perceive any further color change
with naked eye beyond this point. Polyimide 3b attained
90% of a complete coloring and bleaching in less than 4 and
1 s, respectively. The optical contrast measured as D%T of
polyimide 3b between neutral pale yellow and oxidized pur-
plish blue states was found to be 42.5% at 549 nm and
51.3% at 594 nm. Coloration efficiency (CE; g) is a useful
term for measuring the power efficiency of the electrochro-
mic devices and can be calculated via optical density using
the following equation:25,26
g ¼ DODðkmaxÞ=Q;
where Q is the injected/extracted charge per unit electrode
area (mC cm2), and DOD is the change in absorbance at spe-
cific wavelength maximum during a redox step. The coloration
efficiency of 3b film at 549 and 594 nm was calculated to be
121 and 154 cm2 C1, respectively, comparable to the reported
data for some electrochromic p-conjugated polymers.27 The
long-term stability of polyimide 3b was investigated by moni-
toring the electrochromic contrast (D%T) of the thin film upon
repeated squarewave potential steps of 4 s in a 0.1 M Bu4N-
ClO4/CH3CN electrolyte solution between 0.5 and þ1.30 V. In
over 100 cycles under ambient conditions, polyimide 3b
showed larger loss of electrochromic contrast (near 50%) as
compared to the polyamides (less than 5%) derived from the
same pyrenylamine-based diamine.18 These less stability might
be attributable to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the
imide group. Even though the slightly lower long-term stability
of polyimide 3b, it still exhibited interesting ambipolar electro-
chromic behaviors upon oxidation or reduction.
CONCLUSIONS
A new series of electroactive polyimides incorporated with
diphenylpyrenylamine group as a fluorophore and redox-
chromophore have been synthesized. All the polymers could
form morphologically stable and uniform amorphous films
using solution-casting techniques. In addition to high Tg, high
thermal stability and strong fluorescence (for the semiaro-
matic polyimides), the polymers also revealed ambipolar
multielectrochromic characteristics. Thus, these polyimides
may find optoelectronic applications as new hole-transport-
ing, light-emitting, and electrochromic materials.

Two new pyrenylamine-based polyimides were prepared from the polycondensation reaction of
N,N-di(4-aminophenyl)-1-aminopyrene with pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) or 1,4,5,8-
naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA). The polyimide derived from PMDA is soluble in hot
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and can be solution-cast into a flexible and strong film. The polyimides showed
high glass transition temperatures (Tg > 364
C) and high thermal stability. Cyclic voltammetry studies
revealed that these two polyimides were ambipolar; they showed well-defined and reversible redox
couples during both p- and n-doping processes, together with multi-electrochromic behaviors. The
polymer films also exhibited high coloration efficiency, high redox stability, and fast response time.
Introduction
Electrochromism results from the formation of new optical
transitions in an electroactive surface film or an electroactive
solute as the result of electrochemical oxidation or reduction.1
This is an intriguing phenomenon for which there might be
a wide range of applications, including smart windows, memory
elements, large-area information panels, electronic papers
(e-papers), and chameleon materials.2 In general, four major
classes of materials are used to construct electrochromic devices
(ECDs), including metal oxides, inorganic coordination
complexes, molecular dyes, and conjugated polymers.1,3 Among
the available electrochromic materials, p-conjugated polymers
represented by polypyrroles and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-
thiophene) (PEDOT) and their derivatives have received a great
deal of attention because they combine fast response times, high
optical contrast ratios, long-term redox stability and color
tunability through structural control as well as mechanical
deformability, a requirement for flexible electronic applications.4
Despite the attractive electrochromic performance of many
conjugated polymers, some of them were prepared by electro-
chemical polymerization and were insoluble after deposition on
the electrode surface which may hamper their applications for
large area devices. Although a great deal of success has already
been made in the recent years when it comes to the design and
preparation of solution-processable conjugated polymers for
electrochromics,3g less thermally stable substituents such as alkyl
and alkoxy groups usually need to be introduced onto the
polymer backbone. This leads to a decrease in thermal stability of
the material. In addition, long-term stability of conjugated
polymers remains a problem. For example, PEDOT degrades
over time if exposed to light or heat. Therefore, there remains
a great need to develop polymeric electrochromics with useful
electrochromic properties as well as good processability and high
thermal stability.
Aromatic polyimides are commercially important materials
used extensively in a wide range of optoelectronic applications
due to their excellent chemical, thermal, and dielectric proper-
ties.5 Despite their outstanding properties, most of the conven-
tional aromatic polyimides have high melting or glass-transition
temperatures (Tg) and limited solubility in most organic solvents
because of their rigid backbones and strong interchain interac-
tions. Thus, polyimide processing is generally carried out via the
poly(amic acid) precursor, which is then converted to polyimide
by vigorous thermal or chemical cyclodehydration. However,
this process has inherent problems such as the emission of
volatile by-products and storage instability of poly(amic acid)
solution. To overcome these problems, many attempts have been
made to synthesise soluble and processable polyimides in fully
imidized form while maintaining their excellent properties.6 The
majority of the methods used for improving the solubility while
maintaining the high-temperature performance of polyimides
have involved the structural modifications of dianhydride and
diamine monomers.7 Incorporation of three-dimensional,
packing-disruptive triarylamine units into the polyimide back-
bone not only resulted in enhanced solubility but also led to new
electronic functionality of polyimides, such as electrochromic8
and memory9 characteristics, due to the redox-activity of the
triarylamino core.
Aromatic imide dyes, especially perylenediimides, have been
used as n-type semiconductors and electron acceptors in many
fundamental studies of organic electronics including molecular
switches and wires,10 solar energy conversion devices,11 n-channel
thin film transistors,12 and electrochromic or light-emitting
devices.13 These molecules have been used in electron-transfer
studies because they undergo reversible one-electron reduction at
modest potentials to form stable anion radicals localized on the
electron deficient units. The electrochemical and spectroscopic
properties of different imides, diimides and polyimides have been
extensively studied.14 The most important electrochemical
property of aromatic diimide-based compounds, such as

onto an ITO-coated glass substrate (20  30  0.7 mm, 50–100
U/square). The polymers were drop-coated onto an active area
(about 20 mm  20 mm) then dried in vacuum. A gel electrolyte
based on PMMA (Mw: 120 000) and LiClO4 was plasticized with
propylene carbonate to form a highly transparent and conduc-
tive gel. PMMA (1 g) was dissolved in dry acetonitrile (5 g), and
LiClO4 (0.1 g) was added to the polymer solution as supporting
electrolyte. Then, propylene carbonate (1.5 g) was added as
plasticizer. The mixture was then slowly heated until gelation.
The gel electrolyte was spread on the polymer-coated side of the
electrode, and the electrodes were sandwiched. Finally, a trans-
parent epoxy resin was used to seal the device.
Measurements
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Horiba FT-720 FT-IR
spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in a Heraeus Vari-
oEL-III CHNS elemental analyzer. The inherent viscosities of
the polymers were determined at 0.5 g dL1 concentration using
an Ubbelohde viscometer at 30 C. Thermogravimetric analyses
(TGA) were conducted with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA.
Experiments were carried out on approximately 3–5 mg film
samples heated in flowing nitrogen or air (flow rate ¼ 20 cm3
min1) at a heating rate of 20 C min1. Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer
Pyris 1 DSC at a scan rate of 20 C min1 in flowing nitrogen
(20 cm3 min1). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with
a CH Instruments 600C electrochemical analyzer using ITO as
a working electrode (the coating area of the polymer film is

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As described previously,16 N,N-di(4-aminophenyl)-1-amino-
pyrene (1) was prepared by a four-step synthetic reaction
sequence starting from the nitration of pyrene. The model
compounds M1 and M2 were synthesized from the condensation
of the pyrenylamine-containing diamine 1 with two equivalents
of phthalic anhydride and 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhy-
dride, respectively, in refluxing acetic acid (Scheme 1). IR and 1H
NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to identify the struc-
tures of the targeted model compounds M1 and M2. The FT-IR
spectra of model compounds M1 to M2 can be seen in ESI
(Fig. S1†). The imide groups of compounds gave two charac-
teristic bands at around 1778–1784 and 1717–1712 cm1,
respectively (imide asymmetric and symmetric stretching). Model
compound M2 also shows aliphatic C–H strectching peaks at
2937 and 2856 cm1. The 1H NMR spectra of model compounds
M1 and M2 are illustrated in Fig. S2 and Fig. S3†, respectively.
Because of the substitution at the 1-position of the pyrene unit,
the NMR spectra of M1 and M2 are very complicated. Never-
theless, full assignments of all peaks can be done with the aid of
two-dimensional (2D) COSY NMR spectra. Thus, the results of
all the spectroscopic analyses suggest the successful preparation
of the target model compounds.
Polyimide 3a was prepared by the polycondensation of
diamine 1 and pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA; 2a) via
a conventional two-step process, that is, the formation of
a poly(amic acid) and subsequent thermal or chemical imid-
ization (Scheme 2). The poly(amic acid) precursor of 3a
exhibited a very high inherent viscosity of 2.02 dL g1 in DMAc
and could be cast into a flexible and tough poly(amic acid) film,
which could be subsequently converted into a tough polyimide
film by extended heating at elevated temperatures. The poly-
(amic acid) precursor also could be chemically dehydrated to
Scheme 1 Synthesis of model compounds.

negative potentials due to the reduction of the pyrene group. The
redox waves observed during the anodic sweep can be attributed
to the formation of radical cation originated from the oxidation
of the triarylamine core. The proposed sequential reduction
reactions and oxidation reaction for generation of the radical
anions and cations are shown in Scheme 3. The dianion form of
polyimide 3b is represented by reduced cis-carbonyls. It can also
be represented by reduced trans-carbonyls, but this requires the
loss of aromaticity in the naphthalene unit.13a
Spectroelectrochemical and electrochromic properties
The electro-optical properties of the polymer films were investi-
gated using the changes in electronic absorption spectra at
various applied voltages. For these investigations, the polyimide
film was cast on an ITO-coated glass slide (a piece that fit in the
UV-vis cuvette), and a homemade electrochemical cell was built
from a commercial UV-vis cuvette. The cell was placed in the
optical path of the sample light beam in a commercial diode
array spectrophotometer. This procedure allowed us to obtain
electronic absorption spectra under potential control in a 0.1 M
Bu4NClO4/acetonitrile or DMF solution. The results of the 3a
film upon oxidation and reduction is presented in Fig. 5 as
a series of UV-vis-NIR absorption curves correlated to electrode
potentials. In the neutral form the film exhibits a strong band at
319 nm with a shoulder at 362 nm, due to the p–p* transitions,
but it is almost transparent at wavelengths longer than 450 nm.
Upon oxidation of the 3a film (increasing electrode potential
from 0 to 1.35 V), the intensity of the absorption bands at 319
and 362 nm gradually decreased while new peaks at 547 and
589 nm in the visible region together with a broad band from
600 nm extending out into the NIR region beyond 1100 nm
gradually increased in intensity (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, the color of
the film changed from pale yellow to purplish blue. We attribute
these spectral changes to the formation of a stable radical cation
of the diphenylpyrenylamine moiety. Fig. 5b to 5d show the
spectral changes of the 3a film upon reduction. The radical anion
3a, which appears at potentials between 0.70 and 1.00 V vs.
Ag/AgCl, exhibits a strong band at 331 nm and two peaks in the
visible region (a stronger band at 723 nm with a shoulder at
657 nm). As shown in the inset of Fig. 5b, the radical anion form
of polyimide 3a is pale green in color. Further reduction at
potentials below 1.45 V results in the two-electron reduced
(dianion) state with a new peak at 563 nm and a shoulder at
526 nm, and the film turns to a red-violet color during the second
reduction (Fig. 5c). The spectral changes associated with the
reduction reactions of the pyromellitimde unit are very similar to
that of standard PMDA–ODA polyimide (ODA: 4,40-oxydiani-
line) reported by Mazur et al.14a This result reaffirms that the
diamine residue has very little direct influence on the reduction of
the diimide moiety as reported by Mazur et al.14a The spectrum at
2.15 V (Fig. 5d) has a strongly intensified peak at 563 nm with
slightly intensified shoulders at 509 and 526 nm and a concurrent
drop of the absorption intensity at 653 and 723 nm. Since the
potential examined is similar to the third cathodic process, the
spectral change is assigned to the radical anion formation arising
from the reduction of the pyrene unit. At this stage, the polymer
film appears as a bright pink color.
Electrochromic switching and stability
Electrochromic switching studies for the polyimides were per-
formed to monitor the percent transmittance changes (D%T) as
a function of time at their absorption maximum (lmax) and to
determine the response time by stepping potential repeatedly
between the neutral and oxidized states. The active area of the
polymer film on ITO glass is about 1 cm2. Fig. 6 depicts the
optical transmittance as a function of time at 547 and 589 nm by
applying square-wave potential steps of 4 s between 0.5 and
+1.35 V. The response time was calculated at 90% of the full-
transmittance change because it is difficult to perceive any
further color change with naked eye beyond this point. Polyimide
3a attained 90% of a complete coloring and bleaching in less than

Finally, we fabricated as preliminary investigations single
layer electrochromic cells (Fig. 7). The polyimide films were
spray-coated onto ITO-glass and then dried. Afterwards, the gel
electrolyte was spread on the polymer-coated side of the elec-
trode and the electrodes were sandwiched. To prevent leakage,
an epoxy resin was applied to seal the device. As a typical
example, an electrochromic cell based on polyimide 3a was
fabricated. The polymer film is pale yellow in neutral form. When
the voltage was increased (to a maximum of 2.7 V), the color
changed to purplish blue due to electro-oxidation, the same as
was already observed for the solution spectroelectrochemistry
experiments. When the potential was subsequently set back at
0 V, the polymer film turned back to original pale yellow. We
believe that optimization could further improve the device
performance and fully explore the potential of these electro-
chromic polyimides.
Conclusions
We have successfully prepared two new pyrenylamine-bearing
redox-active polyimides and demonstrated that these polymers
show modest solubility in organic solvents, high Tg, and ambi-
polar and multicolored electrochromic behavior. Electro-
chemical and spectral results showed that these polymers can be
employed as potential anodically and cathodically coloring
materials in the development of electrochromic devices. Further
development of materials of this type would seem to be war-
ranted by the encouraging initial results presented here.

polyamides and polyimides) carrying the triarylamine unit as an
electrochromic functional moiety.17 Our strategy was to synthe-
size the triarylamine-containing monomers such as diamines and
dicarboxylic acids that were then reacted with the corresponding
comonomers through conventional polycondensation tech-
niques. The obtained polymers possessed characteristically well-
defined structure, high molecular weights, and high thermal
stability. Because of the incorporation of packing-disruptive,
three-dimensional triarylamine units along the polymer back-
bone, most of these polymers exhibited good solubility in polar
organic solvents. They can form uniform, transparent, and
amorphous films by solution processes such as spin-coating,
inkjet-printing, or spray-coating. This is advantageous for the
production of large-area, thin-film devices at low cost. To our
knowledge, there has been no report of pyrenylamine-containing
condensation polymers. In view of the attractive properties
associated with the pyrene and triarylamine units, herein we
report the synthesis of N,N-di(4-aminophenyl)-1-aminopyrene,
as a new diamine monomer, and its derived polyamides con-
taining pyrenylamine chromophores. The introduction of the
pyrenylamine moiety into the polyamide backbone leads to
interesting photophysical, redox, and electrochromic properties
useful for optoelectronic applications.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The pyrene-containing triarylamine-based diamine monomer 4
was synthesized by the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 1.
1-Nitropyrene (1) was synthesized by nitration of pyrene with
copper nitrate.18 Catalytic reduction of the nitro group
of compound 1 by means of hydrazine and Pd/C gave
1-aminopyrene (2). According to a well-established procedure,19
the target diamine monomer N,N-di(4-aminophenyl)-1-amino-
pyrene (4) was prepared by hydrazine Pd/C-catalyzed reduction
of N,N-di(4-nitrophenyl)-1-aminopyrene (3) resulting from N,N-
diarylation of 1-aminopyrene with 4-fluoronitrobenzene in the
presence of caesium fluoride (CsF). The structures of all the
synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental, IR, and
NMR analyses. The FT-IR spectra of compounds 1 to 4 can be
seen in the ESI (see Fig. S1†). The nitro groups of compounds 1
and 3 gave two characteristic bands at around 1580–1590 and
1300–1330 cm1, respectively (-NO2 asymmetric and symmetric
stretching). After reduction to 2 and 4, the characteristic
absorptions of the nitro group disappeared and the primary
amino group showed the typical absorption pair at 3400–
3200 cm1 due to N–H stretching. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra
of the intermediate compounds 1–3 are also shown in the ESI
(Fig. S2 to S7†). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the target
diamine monomer 4 are illustrated in Fig. 1. The complete
conversion of the nitro groups to the amino groups was
confirmed by the high-field shift of the phenylene protons and by
the resonance signals at around 4.81 ppm corresponding to the
amino protons. Because of the substitution at the 1-position of
the pyrene unit, the NMR spectra of 4 are very complicated.
Nevertheless, full assignments of all peaks can be done with the
Scheme 1 Synthetic route to the target diamine monomer 4.

incorporation of thermally stable pyrene unit, all the polymers
exhibited higher Td values compared to their corresponding 6
0
series counterparts derived from 4,40-diaminotriphenylamine.
These polyamides not only showed good thermal stability but
also possessed high glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of 246–
326 C. The lowest Tg value of 6j is expected and can be explained
in terms of the flexible polymethylene segments in its backbone.
As compared to the 60 series analogs, the present series poly-
amides exhibit a remarkably increased Tg as a result of the
presence of rigid pyrene segments. The softening temperatures
(Ts) (may be referred as apparent Tg) of the polyamide films
determined by the TMA method using a loaded penetration
probe are also listed in Table 1. They were read from the onset
temperature of the probe displacement on the TMA trace. In
most cases, the Ts values of the polyamides obtained by TMA are
comparable to the Tg values measured by the DSC experiments.
Thus, the thermal analysis results revealed that these polyamides,
especially for the aromatic ones, exhibited excellent thermal
stability, which in turn is beneficial to increase the service time in
device application and enhance the morphological stability to the
spin-coated film.
Optical properties
All the polyamides were examined by UV-Vis absorption and
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy in both solution and the
solid state. Fig. 4 shows representative examples of the
absorption and emission profiles of the selected polyamides in
NMP, together with their PL images on exposure to an UV light
in both solution and solid states. The relevant absorption and PL
data are collected in Table 2. In the absorption spectra all the
polyamides display two to three prominent bands with unsym-
metrical shape and adjoining shoulders. The most bath-
ochromically shifted transitions may be ascribed to that
originating from the amine to pyrene and amine to amide
intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) states. The strong high-
energy absorption bands at ca. 325 nm are assigned to that
arising from pyrene based p–p* transitions. These absorption
bands are relatively insensitive to the solvent compared with the
corresponding emission bands. Solid film absorption spectra of
these polyamides were similar to those in solution, with a very
slight red-shift of ca. 1–6 nm. All the polyamides exhibit similar
emission profiles in NMP solutions with emission maxima in the
range 522–544 nm. This clearly indicates that the emission
originates from a similar excited state in this class of polymers.
We believe that the emission mainly comes from the diphe-
nylpyrenylamine core because it has a lower energy gap. As
shown in Fig. 4, the emission color of the NMP solutions of these
polyamides is greenish yellow, whereas that of the solid films is
green or yellowish green. As shown in Table 2, the fluorescence
quantum yields (FF) of these polyamides in NMP solution
were found to vary from 0.7% to 30.2% relative to the

changes from blue in toluene (PL lmax ¼ 480 nm) to greenish
yellow in DMSO (lmax ¼ 544 nm). A decreased fluorescence
quantum yield and an increased band width were also observed
in the solvent of higher polarity. The solvatochromism could be
attributed to the fast intramolecular charge-transfer process
resulting in a large change of dipole moment in the excited
state.25 Such solvatochromic behavior is associated with the
stabilization of the polar emissive excited states by the polar
solvents.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were conducted to inves-
tigate the electrochemical properties of the polyamides. The
oxidation and reduction cycles of the film samples were measured
in acetonitrile and DMF, respectively, using tetrabutylammo-
nium perchlorate, Bu4NClO4, as the electrolyte. Samples were
coated on the surface of the ITO-glass by a solution-casting
process. Typical CV curves of polyamide 6d are shown in Fig. 7.
All the polyamides displayed reversible oxidation and reduction
processes, indicating their high electrochemical stability for both
p- and n-doping. These reversible waves also represent the
formation of stable radical cation and radical anion originating
from electrochemical redox reactions of the diphenylpyrenyl-
amine core (Scheme 4). The onset potential of the reduction
process was recorded in the range from 1.86 to 1.77 V. From
the positions of the redox couple peaks of the reduction process,
the n-doping half-wave potentials, Ered
1/2, for polyamides 6a–6j
were determined, and these values range from 2.05 to 1.96 V
(Table 4). These potentials are similar to those found in related
pyrene derivatives.26 The color of the polyamide films changed
from yellow to pale orange due to electrochemical reduction of
the polymers. The onset and half-wave potentials (Eox
1/2) of the
oxidation process were found to be around 0.66–0.70 V and
0.81–0.83 V, respectively. The oxidation potentials are relatively
insensitive to the structure of the dicarboxylic acid component in
these polyamides. Variations of less than 0.04 V were observed in
the 6a–6j series, and this indicates that the diacid residue does not
significantly disturb the electronic nature of the oxidizable tri-
arylamine core. The color of the polyamide films turned from
yellow to purple upon oxidation. In comparison to the corre-
sponding 60 analogs, the 6 series polyamides displayed a slightly
lower oxidation potential. This suggests that the presence of
electron-rich pyrene moiety in the latter case is responsible for
the decrease in the oxidation potential.
On the basis of the oxidation and reduction onset potentials,
the bandgaps for polyamides 6a–6j were calculated, and were
found to vary from 2.45 to 2.56 eV. The bandgaps calculated
from the CV measurements are somewhat lower (by 0.11–
0.22 eV) than those obtained from the absorption spectra. By
using the oxidation and reduction onset potentials, the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels for these polyamides
were calculated and found to be between 5.02 and 5.06 eV
(relative to the vacuum energy level), whereas the values for the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels lay between
2.50 and 2.59 eV (Table 4). When the calculations are based on
Fig. 7 Cyclic voltammograms of the polyamide 6d film on an ITO-
coated glass substrate in 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 acetonitrile (for the oxidation
process) and DMF (for the reduction process) solutions at a scan rate of
50 and 100 mV s1, respectively. The arrows indicate the film color change
during CV scan. E1/2 values are indicated by dashed lines.

absorbing oxidized state (purple). The film colorations are
distributed homogeneously across the polymer film and survive
for more than hundreds of redox cycles. Moreover, coloration
changes were also observed in these polyamides upon reduction.
However, the color change is not strong as that observed in the
anodic scanning. In general, the polyamide films changed from
yellow neutral form to a pale orange reduced form. Typical
electronic absorption changes of the 6d film upon reduction are
illustrated in Fig. S15†.
Upon oxidation, the polyamide films exhibited a strong
coloration change between redox states. The stability, response
time, and color efficiency are the key parameters for an electro-
active polymer film to be amenable for usage in optical and
electrochromic devices. For optical switching studies, polymer
films were cast on ITO-coated glass slides in the same manner as
described above, and each film was potential stepped between its
bleaching (0.0 V) and coloring (+1.00 V) state. While the films
were switched, the absorbance at 834 nm was monitored as
a function of time with UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy. The switching
time was calculated at 90% of the full switch because it is difficult
to perceive any further color change with the naked eye beyond
this point. The polyamides switch rapidly (within three seconds)
between the highly transmissive neutral state and the colored
oxidized state. As depicted in Fig. S16†, the thin film of poly-
amide 6d required only 2.9 s at 1.00 V for coloring and 1.0 s for
bleaching. As shown in Fig. 10, the absorbance changes at
834 nm reflect the switch in current, and the kinetics of the charge
transport process can be referenced to the coloration response
time. Fig. 11 shows the change in transmittance measured as the
rate of switching the polymer film of 6d, between oxidized and
neutralized, is increased. As the polymer is switched between
0 and 1.0 V with a 10 s hold at each potential, the percent
transmittance (DT) contrast for 834 nm is 65.0%. As the time the
oxidizing and reducing potentials are held is decreased to 5 s, the
optical contrast decreases only slightly to 61.4%, and subse-
quently to 46.6% for a 2 s hold. The electrochromic coloration
efficiencies (h ¼ DOD834/Q)27 after various switching steps of the
film of polyamide 6d are summarized in Table 5. The

3. Polymer synthesis 
According to the phosphorylation polyamidation technique 
described by Yamazaki and coworkers,9 a series of novel 
polyamides (8a-8d) with 3,6-dimethoxycarbazoyl-substituted TPA 
units were synthesized from the diamine 6 and various dicarboxylic 
acids 7a-7d using triphenyl phosphite (TPP) and pyridine as 
condensing agents (Scheme 2). The obtained polyamides had 
inherent viscosities in the range of 0.52–0.57 dL/g and could be 
solution-cast into flexible and tough films, indicating high 
molecular weight polymers. 
4. Solubility and film property 
The solubility behavior of polyamides was tested qualitatively, and 
the results are summarized in Table 1. All the polyamides were 
highly soluble in polar solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF, and 
DMSO, and the high solubility could be attributed to the 
introduction of bulky, packing-disruptive 3,6-dimethoxycarbazolyl- 
substituted triphenylamino unit into the repeat unit. Thus, the 
excellent solubility makes these polymers potential candidates for 
practical applications by spin-coating or inkjet-printing processes 
to afford high performance thin films for optoelectronic devices.

5. Electrochemical properties 
The electrochemical behavior of the polyamides was 
investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) conducted for the cast 
film on an ITO-coated glass substrate as working electrode in dry 
acetonitrile (CH3CN) containing 0.1 M of Bu4NClO4 as an 
electrolyte under nitrogen atmosphere. The derived oxidation 
potentials are summarized in Table 2. The representative cyclic 
voltammograms for polyamides 8b (with methoxy substituents on 
the active sites of the carbazole unit) and 8’b (without the methoxy 
substituents on its carbazole unit) are illustrated in Figure 2 for 
comparison. There are two reversible oxidation redox couples with 
half-wave potentials (E1/2) of 0.76 V and 1.04 V for polyamide 8b 
and 0.83 and 1.26 V for polyamide 8’b, respectively. We found that 
polyamide 8b is more easily being oxidized than its analogous 
polyamide 8’b. Polyamide 8b also preserved good electroactivity 
after 5 repetitive scans between 0.0 and 1.3 V at a scan rate of 50 
mV/s. In contrast, the corresponding polyamide 8’b without the 
methoxy groups on its carbazole unit rapidly lost redox 
reversibility in five cycles. Thus, the introduction of 
electron-donating methoxy group not only greatly prevents the 
coupling reaction but also slightly lowers the oxidation potentials 
of the present polyamides. According to these results, mechanisms 
of oxidation reactions for polyamides 8b and 8’b are proposed in 
Scheme 3. For polyamide 8b, the two oxidation processes observed 
correspond to successive one electron removal from the TPA and 
carbazole moieties. These processes are highly reversible due to

7. Conculsions  
A series of novel carbazole and triphenylamine-functionalized 
aromatic polyamides were readily prepared from the newly 
synthesized aromatic diamine monomer 
4,4’-diamino-4’’-(3,6-dimethoxycarbazol-9-yl)triphenylamine with 
various aromatic dicarboxylic acids via the phosphorylation 
polyamidation reaction. Because of the introduction of 
three-dimensional triphenylamine units and bulky 
3,6-dimethoxycarbazole pendent groups in polymer backbone, all 
the polymers were amorphous, had good solubility in many polar 
aprotic solvents, and exhibited excellent film-forming ability. All 
the obtained polyamides revealed good electrochemical and 
electrochromic stability along with multi-electrochromic behavior. 
By substitution of the electrochemically active C-3 and C-6 sites of 
the carbazole unit with electron-donating methoxy groups, the new 
polyamides exhibit greatly enhanced electrochemical stability and 
electrochromic performance in comparison with previously 
reported analogs without methoxy substituents on the carbazole 
moiety. Such prominent features make these processable polymers 
amenable for optoelectronic applications such as OLEDs and 
electrochromic devices.
