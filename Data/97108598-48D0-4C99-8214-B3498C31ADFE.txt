2highly sensitive electronic balance (AG245, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) with an accuracy of 0.0001 g.
The HDPE samples were completely immersed into Teflon bottles containing organic solvent at 25±1oC.
After being taken out of the bottle every 5~10 minutes, the surface of HDPE sample was gently dried by
wrapping and was weighed immediately using the electronic balance. The efforts were taken to
minimize the time needed to weigh the HDPE sample. The samples were weighed until the sorption of
organic solvent onto HDPE reached equilibrium.
2.3 ASTM F739 permeation experiment
As shown in Fig. 2, the permeation experiments were conducted using the ASTM F739 liquid
chemical permeation method with a closed loop system [9].  The 2” glass permeation cel (Pesce 
Laboratories, Pennsylvania, USA) was assembled and placed in an incubator at temperature of 25±1oC.
The collection medium (i.e., deionized water) was circulated through permeation cell using a
MasterFlex® PTFE-Tubing pump system (CZ-77912-00, Cole-Parmer, USA). The closed loop system
was connected with Teflon tubing. The total volume of collection medium in the system was
maintained approximate 730 mL.
Every 30 minutes intervals, 4.5 mL aliquots of the collection medium were withdrawn from the
downstream sampling point using gas-tight syringes. Simultaneously, 4.5 mL of deionized water was
replenished into the well-stirred Teflon bottle to maintain the constant total volume of collection medium.
The samples of collection medium were analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with flame
ionization detector (AutoSystem XL, Perkin Elmer, USA). The permeation and immersion
experiments were repeated four times for each organic solvent and thickness.
2.4 Migration of organic solvent through geomembrane
The diffusion of organic solvents in the geomembrane can be expressed by Fick’s first law:
(1)Z
dC
J D
dZ

where J is the permeation rate per unit area (ML-2T-1); D is the diffusion coefficient of organic solvent in
the geomembrane (L2T-1); CZ is the solvent concentration in the geomembrane (ML-3); and Z is the
distance into the geomembrane (L).
The governing differential equation for transient diffusion is given by Fick’s second law as:
(2)
2
Z Z

C C
= D
t Z
 
 
During immersion tests, the change of geomembrane weight, Ct, is calculated as:
(3)t ot
o
W -W
C =
W -W
 
 
 
where Wo is the initial weight of the sample (M); Wt is the weight of geomembrane at time t (M); W∞is
the maximum weight of geomembrane (M).
In the case of immersion test, Cz=0 and Cz=L for Eq. (2) are assumed to be equal to the solubility, S
(ML-3), of organic solvent in geomembrane at any time. Therefore, the diffusion coefficient, D (L2T-1),
of organic solvent in geomembrane with initial thickness of L can be estimated using the sorption curve
as follows [2, 6-8, 10-11]:

D =

   
whereθis the initial gradient (i.e. before 55% equilibrium) of the Ct- t sorption curve.
Furthermore, the solubility S can be determined using the equilibrium sorption data as follows [8, 12]:
(5)o

S =

where Vo is the initial volume of geomembrane sample (L3).
For the steady state, the solubility coefficient, K (dimensionless), of organic solvent in
4thickness increased. They presumed this result by reason of the experimental error or unknown factors.
The microstructures of HDPE samples were examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM,
JSM-5400, JEOL, Japan) to obtain high resolution images of HDPE surfaces. Although the HDPE
samples were manufactured by the same company, Fig. 5 shows that the HDPE samples were obviously
different in morphology. The surface of 0.5 mm HDPE was much smoother than 1 mm and 2 mm
samples. Therefore, the crystalline state may be not the same for HDPE samples, resulting in
significant different diffusion and solubility coefficients.
3.3 Steady state permeation rate for ASTM F739
Fig. 6 shows the concentrations of collection medium for 1 mm HDPE permeation experiments.
During the initial period, the permeation concentrations were below the limit detection level. Once
breakthrough was occurred, the solvent concentrations in the collection medium were increased linearly
(i.e., steady state). As seen in Fig. 6, dichloromethane needed approximate 400 minutes to reach steady
state permeation in 1 mm HDPE. On the other hand, Fig. 3 shows that the equilibrium sorption of
dichloromethane occurred after 900 minutes in the immersion test. Similar results were found for TCE,
chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane. As a result, the test duration for ASTM F739 experiment can be
shorter than the immersion test.
According to ASTM F739 standard method, the experimental steady state permeation rate, Js,p, for
a closed system was calculated as follows:
, (9)s p
V
J
A

whereαis the slope of linear portion of the permeation concentrations (ML-3T-1), as shown in Fig. 6; V
is the total volume of collection medium (730 mL); A is the area of HDPE exposed to the permeate
(18.08 cm2) in the cell. Table 3 shows the average Js,p of organic solvents for 0.5, 1 and 2 mm HDPE.
For ASTM F739 method, the resistance of geomembrane to permeant is reported as the steady state
permeation rate. Fig. 7 shows that Js and Js,p given in Table 3 were significantly correlated with
r2=0.947 (p<0.001). Js and Js,p were very close to 1:1 line indicating good agreement between ASTM
F739 and immersion methods. Except for test duration, the immersion test could be a convenient
technique to measure the steady state permeation rate for HDPE geomembrane.
4. Conclusions
Fick’s difusion coeficients and solubility coefficients of dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane,
chloroform and TCE in 0.5, 1 and 2 mm HDPE geomembrane were determined using the sorption data
from immersion methods. The diffusion kinetic of the experimental organic solvents in HDPE
followed a slight deviation from the Fickian mode. The results of ANOVA tests show that the diffusion
and solubility coefficients were significant different for three thickness of HDPE samples. This may be
because of the different crystalline state for HDPE samples.
In contrast to the ASTM F739 method, both surfaces of geomembrane sample are in contact with
the tested chemical for immersion method. However, the steady state permeation rates were found to
be significantly correlated for the ASTM F739 and immersion methods. It is to be noted that the
immersion method can be a useful screening test for understanding the chemical resistance to HDPE
geomembrane, special for the steady state permeation rates.
