I. INTRODUCTION 
   In fire conditions, beam-to-column connections play an important role on structural behaviors for 
steel structures.  Due to the strength and stiffness degradation of steel at elevated temperatures, whether 
the connections are able to sustain large forces and rotations in fire directly affects the ability of 
connections to redistribute forces from beams to other structural members and also influences the survival 
time of steel structures in fire.  The evidences from the WTC building collapses [1,2] demonstrate the 
importance of connections for steel structures in fire.  Besides, many fire scene investigations of steel 
buildings [3,4,5] and the results of the Cardington full-scale eight story steel building fire tests in the UK 
[6] show how the connections help structural system survive extreme fires without progressive collapse.  
The Hsichih Eastern Science Park [7] and Cardington fire tests [6] also confirm that the bottom flange 
local buckling and the ensuing web buckling are the main failure mechanisms observed in the bare 
beam-to-column connections.  Therefore, keeping beam-to-column connections from failures is an 
important issue of steel structures in fire. 
 In year 2007, our research group completed an Architecture and Building Research Institute (ABRI) 
experimental program entitled “The Structural Behaviors of H-Beam to Box-Column Connections in 
Fire”.  In this experimental program, two full-scale column-tree beam-to-column moment connection 
specimens were tested at elevated temperatures.  The column-tree moment-resisting frame (MRF) 
system is a common steel construction practice in Taiwan due to its better quality control in 
beam-to-column joint welding and its erection efficiency in construction.  Fig. 1 shows the connections 
of a typical column-tree moment resisting frame in Taiwan.  Unlike other moment-resisting frames 
connecting a whole beam to two columns, each beam in the column-tree system is divided to one longer 
link beam in the middle and two other stub beams at the ends connected to columns.

Fig. 2 illustrates the dimensions of the two specimens and fire test instrumentations including twelve 
displacement transducers and eighty-three thermal couples.  Fig. 3 shows the fire test setup of one 
specimen in the furnace.  Two fire tests for the two specimens were conducted using the same loading 
and heating process called “constant-load and elevated temperature” fire test procedure.  The gas furnace 
was heated according to the ISO-834 temperature-time heating curve.  The deformations and 
temperature distributions of the specimen against time were monitored and recorded through the whole 
heating process.  Fig. 4 shows the photos of the two specimens after fire test.  The precious test data 
including temperature distributions of the specimens from eighty three K-type thermal couples, 
deformations of the specimens from twelve displacement transducers, and loads applied to the specimens 
were real-time monitored and recorded through the whole heating process until the failure of moment 
connection. Both of the specimens failed at the moment connections because of the strength degradation 
of steel at elevated temperatures.  Fig. 5 shows the fire test data of H-beam displacement against the 
beam temperature at the location where the beam load was applied for the two specimens.  It can be seen 
that, under the same constant loading and elevated temperatures, Specimen #1 with the stub beam made 
of fire-resistant steel can resist higher temperature and stay longer than Specimen #2 in fire.

utilized three methods to simulate the fire-induced temperature distributions for the 3-D FE models of the 
numerical specimens and compare the feasibilities of these four methods.  The three methods are simply 
described as follows:   
― Prescribed Temperature Distributions 
In the first method, the sectional temperature-time data directly collected from the fire test of each 
specimen were utilized as the temperature input in the FE analysis.  Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) show the 
sectional temperature-time data of Specimen #2 in the fire test.  Each sectional temperature-time data 
was assigned to its associated temperature block.  The temperature blocks were obtained by dividing the 
specimen according to the mid-sections of two adjacent sections that distributed with thermal couples as 
shown in Fig. 6(c).  No heat transfer analysis was needed before or during structural analysis for the FE 
analysis using the temperature input generated by this method.  
 
Fig. 6  Sectional Temperature Variation against Time for Specimen #2 
― Sequentially Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis 
Observation from the 2007 ABRI experimental program shows that the structural deformations of the 
two specimens constantly loaded in the heating furnace depended on the high temperatures distributed on 
the specimens, whereas the inverse dependency was within a limited range.  Hence, the so-called 
“sequentially coupled thermal-stress analysis” is employed to conduct the coupled heat transfer and 
structural analyses for the specimens at elevated temperatures.  In fact, the “sequentially coupled 
thermal-stress analysis” performs the finite-element (FE) transient heat transfer analysis first for the 
specimen according to the surface temperature-time data collected from the fire test as the heat input.

dimensions of beam-to-column specimen in the FDS model are the same as those in ABAQUS)

(2) Three-Dimensional FE Modeling for Subassemblage Specimens in Fire 
We employed two types of numerical specimens to study the structural behaviors of steel 
beam-to-column connections in fire in this NSC project.  One is the “cantilevered specimen” and the 
other one is the “H-frame specimen”.  Fig. 8 shows the analogies of the constantly loaded cantilevered 
specimen and H-frame specimen in the heating furnace to simulate the exterior beam-to-column moment 
connection of a building in fire.  The difference between these two specimens is the existence of axial 
restraint in the beam which could result in the compressive force and tensile force (catenary effect) for the 
steel beam in fire.  Related studies [20-22] have shown that cantilevered-type specimens without axial 
restraints are easier to fail in fire.  We have developed a reliable 3-D FE model for the cantilevered 
specimen, which can accurately simulate the structural behaviors of the column-tree moment connection 
specimens in the 2007 ABRI experimental program.  With this successful modeling experience, a more 
advanced 3-D FE model for H-frame specimen has been developed to study the more realistic structural 
behaviors of beam-to-column connections in fire.    
  
(2) For stub beam and link beam, the flange and web are respectively meshed by two layers and four 
layers of brick elements in thickness direction. 
(3) For the meshing of each splice plate, four layers of brick elements are utilized in the thickness 
direction. 
(4) For the meshing of each bolt, two layers, six layers and four layers of brick elements are respectively 
applied to the bolt head, shank and nut in the length direction. 
The FE meshing for an H-frame specimen is similar to a cantilevered type specimen except for that 
the H-frame specimen has a longer H-beam and neglects the splice connection for simplicity.

plate-beam web contact pairs, the contact surfaces on the splice plates are defined as master surfaces and 
those on the beam webs are defined as slave surfaces.  The contact behavior in the normal direction for 
each contact pair is modeled as “hard contact” which has no contact pressure when the contact pair 
surfaces are not contacted.  For the contact behavior in the tangential direction, the isotropic Coulomb 
friction model with the use of penalty method is employed for each contact pair.  
― Boundary and Loading Conditions  
For cantilevered type specimens (see Fig. 9 and Fig. 10(a)), the center of the top column end in the 
FE model is restrained against rotation about the longitudinal axis of the box column (Rz) and restrained 
against translations in all three directions (Ux, Uy, Uz) to simulate the hinge boundary condition at the top 
column end.  Similar boundary condition is applied to the bottom end of the box column in the FE 
model except for releasing the restraint against the translation in the axial direction (Uz) of the box 
column to simulate the roller boundary condition where the upward constant column load (4900 kN) is 
applied.  Besides, to prevent lateral torsional buckling of the H-beam, the restraints against lateral 
translation (Uy) of the H-beam are placed at the location (1.7 m away from the column face) where the 
downward constant beam load (360.6 kN) is applied.   
For H-frame type specimens (see Fig. 10(b)), the boundary and loading conditions for the column are 
the same as the cantilevered specimen.  Only one half of the H-frame specimen is considered in the 3-D 
FE modeling.  The beam end in the half H-frame is restrained against translations and rotations in all 
directions except for the translation in the vertical direction (Uz).  The constant uniform load (111.6 
kN/m) is applied to the beam.  In order to prevent lateral torsional buckling of the H-beam, the restraints 
against lateral translation (Uy) of the H-beam are placed at the location 2 m away from the column face. 
― Material Properties 
In heat transfer analysis, the three coefficients, i.e. thermal conductivity, specific heat and density, are 
required as the important thermal properties for solid materials.  In this research, SN490B steel, 
SN490C-FR fire resistant steel and S10T high strength bolts are assumed to have the same thermal 
properties as the normal structural steel, and the temperature-dependent relationships of the three 
coefficients will be described in ABAQUS/Standard for the heat transfer analyses of the two specimens at 
elevated temperatures.  The temperature-dependent relationship of thermal conductivity for structural 
steel suggested by Eurocode-3 [23] is employed in the FE modeling as follows: 
 For 20C  T  800C: 
    Tk  21033.354  (1a)  
 For 800C  T  1200C: 
  3.27k   (1b)  
where k=thermal conductivity (unit: W/mK); T=steel temperature in Celsius degree. Besides, k=45 
(W/mK) for structural steel is allowed by Eurocode-3 for simple design calculations in high temperatures. 
The more detailed expression of thermal conductivity as a function of chemical composition for 
temperature can be obtained from the NIST report [24].   
The polynomial expression of specific heat as a function of temperature suggested by Eurocode-3 is 
  
  n0= 0.28737362 
  n1= 2.530241710-5 
  n2= 2.633338410-8 
  n3=9.941958810-11 
  n4= 1.261777910-13 
where=Poisson’s ratio; T=steel temperature in Celsius degree. 
 
III. NUMERICAL RESULTS OF FINITE-ELEMENT ANALYSES 
(1) Failure Mode Simulations for Specimens #1 and #2 
Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) compare the connection failure modes simulated in the FE models with the 
exact connection failure photos for Specimens #1 and #2.  It can be seen that the proposed 3-D FE 
models successfully simulated the failure modes of bottom flange local buckling and web local buckling 
at the beam-to-column connection portions of the two specimens.

For Specimen #1, as shown in Fig. 13(a), the two FEA results (the prescribed temperature 
distribution with and without heat transfer analysis) of the connection rotation measured against TB2 
section temperature match well with the fire test data, and the FEA result with heat transfer analysis is 
closer to the fire test result.  In addition, the three FE predicted critical temperatures are very close to the 
test critical temperature with the relative error less than 2%.  Fig. 13(b) illustrates the comparison of the 
three FE simulated and experimental results of connection rotation versus TB2 temperature for Specimen 
#2.  It can be seen that the two FE simulated connection rotations (the prescribed temperature 
distribution with and without heat transfer analysis) are a little lower than the fire test data, but the critical 
temperature results acquired from the three FEA results still give good predictions to the test critical 
temperature with less than 5% relative error. 
(3) H-Beam Displacement Simulations for Specimens #1 and #2 
Figs. 14 and 15 demonstrate the comparisons of the three FE simulated and fire test results of 
H-beam displacements for Specimens #1 and #2 at DB3 and DB4 locations (see Fig. 2), respectively.  
As can be seen in the displacement comparisons, the three proposed 3-D FE models can provide good 
simulations of DB3 and DB4 displacements against the elevated TB2 temperature for both specimens.  
The three proposed 3-D FE models include: one utilizing the prescribed temperature distribution data 
collected from the 2007 ABRI fire tests without heat transfer analysis, one utilizing the same prescribed 
temperature distribution data collected from the 2007 ABRI fire tests and performing sequentially coupled 
thermal-stress analysis, and the other one employing FDS-generated temperature distributions and 
performing sequentially coupled thermal-stress analysis.  At both DB3 and DB4 locations, when the FE 
simulated displacement curves of the two specimens reach their FE predicted critical temperatures, the FE 
simulated curves go down steeply.  This trend in the FE simulated displacement curves is similar to that 
of the test data.  In summary, three of the proposed 3-D FE models can provide satisfactory simulations 
for the specimen deformations at elevated temperatures and give good predictions of critical temperatures 
for each specimen within acceptable error limits.  The 3-D FE models successfully simulated the failure 
modes of bottom flange local buckling and web local buckling for the two specimens at the moment 
connection portions.  The FE simulated results of the two specimens can also give the same conclusion 
that Specimen #1 has the better fire-resistant performance than Specimen #2. 
  
distributions are very close to those using the prescribed temperature distribution.  This verifies that FDS 
can successfully simulate a compartment fire and generate temperature distributions for our specimens in 
fire.     
Figs 16 and 17 also show that the DB3 and DB4 displacements of an H-frame specimen are larger 
than the DB3 and DB4 displacements of a cantilevered specimen at elevated temperatures.  This is due 
to “P- effect” occurred in the beam of an H-frame specimen at high temperatures.  The rising 
temperatures make the beam expand initially.  However, the steel beam in an H-frame type specimen is 
axially restrained and this restraint causes compressive axial force for the beam as shown in Fig. 18.  In 
addition, the DB3 and DB4 displacement curve of each cantilevered type specimen goes down steeply 
due to beam collapse.  However, catenary effect occurred in the beam of an H-frame type specimen 
helps the beam collapse slower than the cantilevered type specimen.  As can be seen in Fig. 18, catenary 
effect occurs when the axial force becomes minus (i.e. tension).  Fig. 19 illustrates the FE simulated 
connection failures of a cantilevered type specimen and an H-frame type specimen in fire.

of the H-frame type specimens in fire.  The 3-D nonlinear FE model of H-frame type specimen is very 
useful for the future works of this multi-year project.  Besides, the superior fire-resistant performance of 
using fire-resistant steel in the beam-to-column connection was also realistically reproduced by the 3-D 
FE models.  This is very useful for the application and development of fire-resistant steel in steel 
structures and improving the fire-resistant performance for steel structures in the future. 
 
V. SELF-EVALUATION & FUTURE WORKS 
After executing the first year NSC project (2009.8.1-2010.10.31) of the proposed three-year research 
project, we have completed the following works: 
(1) Successfully use three methods to simulate the fire-induced temperature distributions for the 3-D FE 
models of the numerical specimens.  One method utilized the prescribed temperature distribution 
data collected from the 2007 ABRI fire tests without heat transfer analysis.  One method utilized the 
same temperature distribution data and performed “sequentially coupled thermal-stress analysis.”  
The other method used FDS-generated temperature distribution data and performed “sequentially 
coupled thermal-stress analysis.” 
(2) Develop a detailed 3-D nonlinear FE model and analysis procedure to accurately simulate the 
structural behaviors of the two steel column-tree moment connection specimens (cantilevered type 
specimens) in fire. 
(3) Develop a detailed 3-D nonlinear FE model and analysis procedure to accurately simulate the 
structural behaviors of the H-frame type specimens in fire. 
(4) Some results of the first year NSC project has been published in the SCI journal, Journal of 
Constructional Steel Research (Volume 66, Issue 2, pp.289-303). 
(5) A journal paper submitted to an SCI journal is under revision.     
With the experiences learned from modeling the structural behaviors of steel beam-to-column connections 
in fire in the first year NSC project, the continuing future works in the second year for the proposed 
three-year research project will focus on: 
(1) Investigate the fire-resistant performance of the frequently used steel beam-to-column connections in 
Taiwan by using the developed 3-D nonlinear FE model, and analyze the failure modes of these 
frequently used beam-to-column connections in fire. 
(2) Investigate the some strategies of using fire-resistant steel and economic measures to improve the 
fire-resistant performances of the frequently used steel beam-to-column connections in fire, and 
reduce the usage of fireproof materials. 
(3) Continue publishing more journal papers from the results of the first year project.
