process, precursor species are normally transported into 
the reactor with a carrier gas and deposit across wafer 
surface. Many researches [2-6] investigated that the 
reactor geometry and operating conditions are main 
factors effects upon flow distribution in the MOCVD 
reactor and thus it also directly affects deposition 
behavior on wafer surface. However, due to MOCVD 
process involves with complex transport phenomena such 
as momentum transport, energy transport, mass transport 
and chemical deposition reactions, it is difficult to 
establish a best operating condition and reactor designs 
for obtaining the optimal growth rate and uniformity by 
try and error experiments. 
In this report, a novel optimal design scheme was 
developed for vertical rotating disc MOCVD reactor. The 
analysis computation program, COMSOL Multiphysics, 
was used for finite-element simulations. An axial 
symmetry 2D reactor model is developed and performed 
to study the effect of design parameters, such as precursor 
inlet velocities, wafer rotating speed, as well as the inlet 
to wafer distance, on GaN film growth behavior. There 
are two objectives to be optimized simultaneously in 
optimization of the MOCVD process, i.e., maximize 
average film-growth rate ( GR ) and minimize 
non-uniformity ( δ ) on substrate. However these two 
objectives are always conflict with each other so that as 
one objective improves, another deteriorates. Accordingly, 
there is no single optimal solution that is the best with 
respect to all the objective function. Instead, there is a set 
of optimal solutions, well-known as Pareto-optimal 
solutions. 
To search the Pareto-optimal solutions of the 
MOCVD process, a multi-objective optimization scheme 
which includes the MO-RCGA and a data-driven 
technique was developed in this report. In the proposed 
optimization scheme, an initial batch of experiments is 
firstly performed to build a nerual-network model (NN). 
The operating conditions such as susceptor temperature, 
the rotating speed of susceptor, the distance from inlet to 
susceptor and precursors inlet flow rate were considered 
as design variables to train the relationship with GR  and 
δ . Then, the Perato-optimal solutions for these two 
objectives were established by the proposed MO-RCGA. 
Based on the criteria according to sorting crowding 
distance, a few selective points among the solutions can 
be pick out for the next batch of experiments. The new 
experiments are performed to calculate the mean squared 
error (MSE) and validate the NN model. The procedure is 
repeated until the MSE value is less than a stop criterion. 
Once the NN model is verified as reliable, the optimal 
operating condition can be determined from 
Pareto-optimal solutions. The simulation results reveal 
that the optimal operating conditions of the MOCVD 
process can be easily determined based on the proposed 
data-driven optimization scheme. 
 
II. Reactor Model and Kinetic Model for 
MOCVD of GaN 
The schematic of vertical rotating disc reactor [2] is 
shown in Figure 1. It is an industrial scale reactor which 
consists of a quartz tube with water cooling. The inside 
diameter is 4.5 inch. Precursors are feeding by a mixed 
showerhead feeding system. The distance from the wafer 
to the inlet is 10 cm. The wafer diameter is 2.5 inch 
placed on the center of rotating susceptor. Before starting 
simulations, the transport phenomena in the vertical 
MOCVD reactor have to be constructed at the first. The 
continuity equation, equation of motion, equation of 
energy, and mass balances of each chemical species for 
temperature-dependent density ( ρ , kg m-3), viscosity (η , 
kg m-1 s-1), heat capacity (Cp, J kg-1 K-1), and thermal 
conductivity (k, W m-1 k-1) are expressed as following

compared to experimental in the range of susceptor 
temperatures of Ts=1123~1225K. Figure 3 demonstrate 
the simulation result in temperature distribution, velocity 
field and distribution of growth rate on wafer surface at 
Ts=1200K. In order to characterize growth ability, two 
performance indexes defined as follow are considered

where GR  is average growth rate and δ  is uniformity 
index. The growth performance for the case of Ts=1200K 
are GR =2.5192 μm/hr and δ =3.965×10-3. It is quite 
obvious that the growth rate distribution on wafer surface 
is lack of uniformity. In following sections, a novel 
multi-objective optimization algorithm and optimal 
design scheme are developed to improve the growth 
ability. 
 
IV. The Proposed MO-RCGA 
In this report, a novel MO-RCGA is proposed for the 
solution of multi-objective optimization problems. In the 
recent past, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been 
widely used for solving various optimization problems. 
RCGA is one kind of EAs, which is very powerful and 
efficient stochastic search approach. Due to its natural 
properties suited for multi-objective optimization 
problems (MOOPs), we apply RCGA for the search of 
Pareto-solutions. In general, MOOPs can be 
mathematically defined as: 
Min./Max.   ( )jf X ,   j=1, 2, …, J. 
s. t.   ( ) ( )L Ui i ix x x≤ ≤ ,  i=1, 2, …, n. 
where n∈ℜX  is the vector of n design or decision 
variables:  [ ]1 2, , , nx x x=X … , and the variable ix  
take a value within a lower ( )Lix  and upper 
( )U
ix  
bound. We firstly redesign and extend the RCGA [10] for 
MOOPs. The configuration of the proposed MO-RCGA is 
shown in Figure 4. In the proposed MO-RCGA, it 
consists of three fundamental operations: crossover, 
mutation and nondominated sorting. Before introducing 
these three main functions, we present the underlying 
ideas and notations. Let [ ]
1 2
, , ...,
n
θ θ θ=θ   be a solution 
set of the optimization problem, which is called the 
chromosome in the sense of genetic algorithm. In the set, 
each iθ  is called a gene. The admissible parameter 
space for θ  is defined as 
( ) ( )
1 1 1
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
2 2 2
{ | ,
                       , ..., }
n L U
L U L U
n n
x x x
x x x x x x
= ∈ℜ ≤ ≤
≤ ≤ ≤ ≤
θΩ θ  
 (8) 
All the genes iθ  are confined in θΩ . That is, during the 
evolution those θ  outside θΩ  will be discarded. 
Further, let N be the number of the chromosomes, and 
cp  and mp  represent the parameters for the functions 
of crossover and mutation respectively. With the above 
notations, we are ready to introduce the operational 
procedure of the proposed MO- RCGA. 
 
4.1 Crossover Operation 
In the proposed MO-RCGA, the crossover operation 
is the main search function for the production of 
candidate solutions. We developed a novel crossover 
operator for MOOPs named Multi-Direction Based 
Crossover (MDBX). In the MDBX, two chromosomes 
are chosen randomly to mate and then generate two new 
offsprings. In doing this, the N chromosomes in the 
population are randomly divided into N/2 pairs. In each 
pair, two chromosomes 1,kθ  and 2,kθ  represent the 
parents for mating, where { }1, 2, ..., / 2k N∈ . Let kc  be 
a random number belonging to [0, 1] . If k cc p> , it 
means that the nature crossover possibility is greater than 
the possibility of the specified threshold cp . Then the 
crossover procedure for 1,kθ  and 2,kθ  is given by 
6 
 
axial symmetry 2D reactor model is performed to study 
the effect of key design parameters on GaN film growth 
rate and uniformity. The orthogonal array technique is 
used to divide these design parameters into series 
simulations for model training. Thereafter, a neural 
network and the proposed MO-RCGA are utilized to 
search for the optimal operating condition and designs 
parameters We follow the procedure stated above step by 
step to improve the film growth performance. 
 
Step 1. Design of Experiments 
Design of experiments is a structured, organized method 
that is used to gather the empirical relationship between 
the design variables and objectives. At first, we consider 
some design parameters that are the key effects on film 
growth rate and uniformity, such as precursor inlet 
velocities, wafer rotating speed and the inlet to wafer 
distance. The constraint of these design parameters are 
described as follow. Inlet velocity of TMGa (uTMGa): 
0.5~2.0 m/s, Inlet velocity of NH3 (uNH3): 0.5~2.0 m/s, 
Rotating speed of susceptor: 0rpm~2000rpm, and the 
distance from inlet to susceptor (h): 0.03m~0.1m. On the 
other hand, due to the susceptor temperature is found not 
to have a great effect on growth rate at the range of 
Ts=1123~1225K, see Figure 2. Thus, the susceptor 
heated temperature is not considered as a design 
parameter and is kept constant at Ts=1200K in this study. 
Besides, in order to observe how the design parameters 
influence flow distribution and growth rate, the operating 
pressure of reactor is kept at 140 torr and the precursors 
mole fraction in carrier gas are fixed xTMGa=1.54×10-4 and 
xNH3=0.15 respectively. Moreover, according to 
investigations of [2-5], the separated precursor feeding 
system can prevent the pre-reaction between two 
precursors from condensing on inlet wall and thus 
improve uniformity of growth thickness. We use the 
quadruple axi-symmetric gas inlet [2] for design. By 
orthogonal array technique [9], the design parameters are 
divided into 45 groups. We depict simulation results in 
Figures 6~9 respectively for the effects of TMGa inlet 
velocity, NH3 inlet velocity, susceptor rotating speed, and 
the distance from inlet to susceptor on growth rate and 
uniformity. The above simulation results have showed the 
relationship between these design parameters and growth 
performance is not prone to be linear correlations. Hence, 
we apply a neural network algorithm to train a model 
from 45 experiments results, [ ]1 2 45; ;...; T=E e e e  
where i =e [ ,i iGR δ ] and i=1,2,…,45. 
 
Step 2. Neural network training 
Neural network is a well-known and efficient tool for 
modeling of complex and nonlinear multivariable systems. 
The routines provided in MATLAB (MathWorks@) is 
used in our study. We choose a simple feed-forward 
nerual network (FNN) structure which consists of an 
input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer to build a 
multi-input/multi-output NN model. Hence, the 
experiment results obtained from the previous stage are 
used to train the relationships between the design 
variables and objective functions. 
 
Step 3. Search of the Pareto-solutions & new 
experiments 
As we have built a NN model, the MO-RCGA which 
proposed in previous section is applied to search the 
Pareto-optimal solutions. The parameters used in the 
proposed MO-RCGA optimization scheme are set as 
follows: N=100, cp =0.1, mp =0.3, s=0.5, Φ =[-0.25 
0.25] and G=100. To verify whether the NN model is 
reliable, some of the Pareto-optimal solutions are picked 
out to be new experiments based on the following 
approach. 
Step 3.a  At first, the Pareto-optimal solutions is sort by 
crowding distance values [11] in descending 
order, P* [ ]1 2, , ..., TN= θ θ θ .  
Step 3.b  Set a counter i=1 and k=1. Until i=p or k=N, 
perform 
“(E = E ∪ kθ ) & (i=i+1) if and only if

reactor model. The operation parameters, such as 
precursor inlet velocity, wafer rotating speed and distance 
from inlet to wafer surface, are investigated 
systematically and has been optimized in order to 
improve GaN film growth thickness and uniformity. To 
determine the Pareto-optimal solutions of above two 
objectives, a data-driven optimization scheme which 
contains design of experiments (DOE), neural network 
(NN), and the MO-RCGA is proposed in this report. The 
optimization scheme consists of two main parts. The first 
part uses the orthogonal array technique to divide each 
design parameter into a certain range and performs a 
series of simulations for neural network model building. 
In the second part, the MO-RCGA is utilized to work 
with the neural network model and to search the 
Pareto-optimal solutions. Based on the criteria according 
to sorting crowding distance, a few selective points 
among the solutions can be pick out for the next batch of 
experiments. The new experiments are performed to 
calculate the mean squared error (MSE) and validate the 
NN model. The procedure is repeated until the MSE 
value is less than a stop criterion. Once the NN model is 
verified as reliable, the optimal operating condition can 
be determined from Pareto-optimal solutions. The 
simulation results reveal that the optimal operating 
conditions of the MOCVD process can be easily 
determined based on the proposed data-driven 
optimization scheme.
