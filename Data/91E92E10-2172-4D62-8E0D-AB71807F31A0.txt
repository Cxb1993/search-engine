I.研究目標 
台灣人口中每百人中約有 9.2 個糖尿病
患[32]，換而言之台灣目前至少存在兩、三
百多萬個患者。根據統計，糖尿病的婦女中
約有  30 至  60%有糖尿病性膀胱病變[31, 
36]。Starer 和 Libow 等學者，則發現糖尿病
老人中竟高達 76%比例有糖尿病性膀胱病變  
[37]。Kaplan 等學者對 182 個糖尿病患者進
行調查，發現  23%病患呈現逼尿肌收縮功
能低落，完全沒有膀胱排尿收縮反射的病人
佔 11%[35]。綜觀以上統計資料，確實有很
高的比例的糖尿病患有各種膀胱功能障礙，
這些問題不僅影響病患的生活品質，又由於
尿液不易排除容易引起下泌尿道急性或慢性
發炎，甚至造成尿液逆流、長期影響腎臟功
能，嚴重可能會進一步引起腎炎、腎水腫，
進而危害生命。因此糖尿病性膀胱病變確實
是在現今社會需要被關注的問題。 
由於糖尿病引發身體各器官的功能病
變，大多源於的神經系統永久損傷所致，因
此功能性電刺激技術應用於糖尿病併發症的
治療是有很大的前景。然而相較於電刺激技
術應用於棘手的胃痙攣治療，目前臨床上糖
尿病引發的慢性膀胱功能障礙，仍無明確的
電刺激治療方式可供使用。原因是下泌尿道
神經調控機制複雜，再加上學術上對於糖尿
病下泌尿道神經系統病理變化並無深入研
究。 
個人實驗室近來的研究結果發現藉由電刺
激調控會陰感覺神經， 可控制正常大白鼠膀
胱的排尿效率[38]，此結果顯示下泌尿道感覺
訊號對於膀胱的排尿功能有重要的影響性。 
因此，以功能性電刺激調控下泌尿道感覺
功能的方式，治療糖尿病性排尿障礙，將是一
個值得嘗試去探究的臨床治療方向。但目前有
關於糖尿病下泌尿道神經電生理機制的研究仍
相當少，因此進行糖尿病性膀胱病變電刺激治
療研究前，必須先對糖尿病的下泌尿道的神經
電生理調控的機制轉變，進行整體性的研究，
包括瞭解下泌尿道感覺功能、神經反射路徑、
神經訊號特性、神經電刺激表現等變化，以及
在不同病程時間點神經調控是否有差異？以上
研究結果，將可做為探討功能性電刺激對於糖
尿病性膀胱功能障礙治療之研究基礎。 
 
本計畫預計分兩年時間來執行， 此兩年
研究計畫將以糖尿病大白鼠為動物模式，第
一年研究重點為深入探討糖尿病性膀胱在下
泌尿道神經調控的變化機轉。第二年則將以
第一年的下泌尿道神經調控邊化機轉研究結
果為基礎，進一步以設計適當的電刺激方式
治療糖尿病性膀胱，使下泌尿道逼尿肌與括
約肌能重新產生協同性互動關係，改善膀胱
排尿功能。 
 
II.實驗方法第一年 
此實驗為第一年的研究內容，主要是探討
糖尿病鼠下泌尿道神經調控機轉。以不同病程
時間點糖尿病鼠，評估下泌尿道是否存在著漸
進式的病理性神經路徑調控，研究內容包含三
個研究重點，第一，利用化學藥物刺激刺激膀
胱，以評估膀胱在糖尿病的侵害下，對於藥物
刺激物所誘發的下泌尿道生理特性改變。第
二，對於膀胱的反射路徑進行研究。第三，在 
CMG 下同時量測下泌尿道壓力與電生理訊號
評估下泌尿道逼尿肌與外尿道括約肌之功能協
調性。 
【動物實驗前處理】 
第一年，全部實驗利用正常雌性大白鼠
(Sprague-Dawley,250-350g)，利用藥物 STZ 誘
發糖尿病。實驗將使用四 組大白鼠，分別為 3
週、6 週、9 週糖尿病鼠以及控制組大白 鼠(每
組各五隻動物)，所有大白鼠將以 urethane 麻醉
後，先以手術刀由下腹部中線切開使膀胱暴
露，接著在膀胱頂部切開一小洞，將一根 PE-
50 管插入膀胱腔內，並用縫合線將此 PE 管固
定在膀胱上，PE 管另一 端 則 連 接 上 一 個 三 
向 閥 轉 接 頭，分 別 同 時 與 一 台 微 量 注 
 4
倒入礦物油防止組織脫水，掛在神經上的電極
分別可以用來量測神經訊號或電刺激神經。 
 
實驗(C) :糖尿病鼠下泌尿道神經訊號特性與膀
胱功能之關係性 
實驗動物在麻醉下接受手術前處理，包括將一
根 PE 管固定在膀胱壁上(膀胱壓)，以及兩條銀
絲線插在外尿道括約肌上(肌電圖)，手術最後
在一側會陰傳入神經上放置一個的神經電極
環，供量測神經訊號使用，實驗將評估訊號間
關性與型態。 
 
實驗方法第二年 
【動物實驗前處理】  
48 隻雄性 SD 大鼠(201 至 225 克)被隨機分
配到兩個組：糖尿病組(diabetic group)和對照組
(control group)。每組又進一步分為兩個小組
(subgroup)，8 週或 18 週糖尿病或正常老鼠。
糖尿病組大白鼠接受每公斤 65 毫克的 STZ 尾
靜脈注射(Sigma，STZ 溶在在 0.1 M 檸檬酸黃
油溶液，pH 4.5 新鮮溶解後 24 小時快速誘導糖
尿病組)。STZ 施打後三天後採取大白鼠血液樣
本，當血糖達到 300 mg / dL 或更大時，代表動
物成功被建立糖尿病模式，可用來做後續實驗
用。對照組老鼠則僅給予尾靜脈生理食鹽水注
射。  
所有 STZ 或生理實驗水注射的老鼠在 8 或
18 週後，則進一步進行尿液動力學及電刺激實
驗。實驗前，所有大鼠在 urethane 麻醉下進行
手術，首先由腹部中線切開使膀胱暴露，接著
將一根 PE 管(PE-50)進入膀胱腔，用以量測膀
胱壓力，接著由尿道兩邊外側分別插入兩根絕
緣的銀線電極暴露提示（0.05 毫米直徑），用
以記錄從尿道外括約肌（EUS）的肌電圖
（EMG）。最後，腹部用尼龍縫線將手術傷口
縫合。再進行膀胱尿液動力學(Cystometry)實驗
時，使用每分鐘 0.3 毫升的生理鹽水灌注膀
胱。接著由大白鼠的下背部進行手術，在經過
切開臀大肌的遠端韌帶後，可以觀察到會陰神
經的感覺分支，接著雙極電刺激電極掛在此神
經上。 
【電刺激會陰部感覺分支神經】 
進行電刺激實驗前，首先我們需建立適當
的刺激電流的範圍，因此我們藉由 Pudendal-
EUS 反射實驗，尋找適當的電流範圍。在完成
刺 激 電 流 的 範 圍 測 試 實 驗 後 ， 在 連 續
cystometry 實驗條件下，進行陰部感覺神經電
刺激實驗，用以評估電刺激對於膀胱排空效率
之影響，每一筆實驗包括至少包含 3 個排尿收
縮。電刺激輸出的狀態控制為當膀胱收縮壓超
過 40 cmH2O 給予電刺激，當壓力低於此閾值
以下，則停止電刺激（圖 8）。 
 
III.結果與討論 
(A) 糖尿病鼠模式的建立(Year 1) 
將大白鼠分成四組，分別為：a.正常組與
利用 STZ (65mg/ml) 尾靜脈注射誘發糖尿病 b.
糖尿病三週c. 糖尿病六週 d.糖尿病九週組。 
於動物進行膀胱壓力量測手術前測量血
糖，血糖值需高於 300mg/dl 以上者為成功誘
發鼠。由表一可看出，由此方法三天後血糖已
上升至>300mg/dl，並且此高血糖可維持至九
週後，不會回復。確保實驗結果之品質。 
 
 
表一、利用 STZ 藥物誘發糖尿病老鼠之體重與
血糖表現情形。 
正常大白鼠與糖尿病大白鼠為在膀胱在接
受連續注入生理食鹽水後產生週期儲尿與
反射性排尿。從圖一結果中可得知老鼠在誘
發糖尿病三週後即出現灌注生理食鹽水誘發第
一次排尿收縮延後，也就是膀胱在漲尿至兩倍
體積後才會產生排尿收縮。此解果顯示隨著糖
尿病的病程越長，膀胱的容積增加，其中暗指
 6
相較於正常鼠，糖尿病九週的老鼠受到藥
物刺激後膀胱收縮壓增加了 4-5 倍，且於施藥
後立即引發完整的排尿收縮。此結果代表著，
糖尿病鼠的乙稀膽鹼受器在膀胱的感覺與運動
神經反射回路中可能其受器的數目或敏感度有
增加的情形，以致於對藥物的反應放大許多。 
(C) 膀胱的反射路徑進行研究 (Year 1) 
此實驗將電極將掛置於一側會陰神上經做
為電刺激用，而另外兩根銀絲線電極則插入外
尿道括約肌，用於量測肌肉電刺激反射訊號。
圖五為正常大白鼠的反射訊號，圖四(a)為未給
予任何電刺激時，所量測到的外尿道括約肌肌
電圖，圖四(b)為在1.0mA下之反射訊號，結果
顯示在約在23.8-32 ms左右之區間(reflex latency)
有明顯的反射產成，此反射區間為短反射(early 
reflex)；然而，在80-125 ms左右的reflex latency
也有明顯的反射，此反射區間為長反射(long 
reflex)。

圖四、在會陰神經-外尿道括約肌反射的訊號
表現，可觀察到有一個短反射(short reflex)

圖五結果為，會陰神經-外尿道括約肌反
射的訊號，在單一電刺激波型輸出(1 Hz, 0.05 
ms pulse duration)，誘發外尿道括約肌反射，
每筆訊號為經過 5~10 筆資料疊加平均後再進
行統計分析」。結果顯示，9 週糖尿病鼠之
短、長反射之平均值皆變長。此結果顯示糖

週糖尿病誘發，實質產生訊號反射差異。

(0.123/min)，同時量測膀胱壓(CMG)、外尿道
括約肌(EUS-EMG)，與會陰神經傳入神經之
訊號。由訊號可以看到膀胱在儲尿期時，外
尿道括約肌與會陰感覺神經皆呈現放電狀
態，與膀胱壓成正相關。然而在膀胱排尿
期，外尿道括約肌則呈現陣發縮性收縮
(burst activity)，但是會陰傳入神經則呈
現休止狀態(silent condition)。

多，並且導致了明顯的intercontraction interval 
和排尿容積的增加、並減少剩餘容積(RV)(圖
8，圖10C，D，E，F，G和H)。然而，在兩個
糖尿病組之間，容量閾值(VT)和收縮振幅(CA)
並沒有被全部的刺激強度所影響(圖10A 和 
B)。

實驗最後一部分，我們發現會陰神經電刺
激在較低的電刺激強度下(0.025-0.05 mA)，
使得 8 週大糖尿病鼠顯著增加 VE，但 18 週大
的糖尿病鼠沒有任何影響變化(圖 10H)。相似
的結果也在其他膀胱參數中被觀察到，包括了
收縮面積、intercontraction interval、排
尿容量和剩餘容量(圖 10D，E，F 和 G)。相反
的，在 0.4mA 的電刺激之下，在 18 週大的糖
尿病鼠身上，其 VE 顯著性的增加，但在 8 週
大的糖尿病鼠身上卻沒有任何的改變。當刺激
強度更進一步的增加到 0.5 mA 以上，在 8 週
的糖尿病鼠的 VE 顯著減少，但對 18 週大的糖
尿病鼠，卻沒有任何的影響。 Two-factor 
ANOVA 指出，VE 與老鼠的條件(即控制組，8

括了有髓鞘的 Aβ 和 Aδ 纖維，沒有髓鞘的C-纖
維和可能有的Aα 纖維 [18, 19]。而有髓鞘的Aα 
或 Aβ 纖維應該具有最低的閾值，沒有髓鞘的
C-纖維則有最高的刺激閾值 [20]。我們的結果
與這些文獻記載具一致性，膀胱的激發起因於
有髓鞘的較大A類纖維在低刺激強度被激發，
而膀胱的抑制則起因於由具較高刺強度閾值的
尿道C纖維[21]被刺激，所造成的抑制性尿道膀
胱反射。 
有趣的是，我們發現，amplitude-dependent 
effect在8週的糖尿病鼠，與18週的糖尿病鼠相
較下，電刺激強度移到了較高的刺激強度範圍
(圖9H；由0.025-0.3 mA升至0.1-0.4 mA)。此強
度轉移的現象可能是因為長時期高血糖症的18
週糖尿病鼠在polyol pathway作用下，大量累積
了oxidative stress products，造成了substantial 
neuropathy。我們的研究結果也間接證實這個
推測，因為相較於控制組，我們的18週糖尿病
鼠，其最小的神經刺激電流閾值引發EUS反
應，是明顯增大的(表格2)，而這符合了在臨床
上糖尿病患者一般具有較高的感覺神經閾值、
較低的泌尿感覺功能的特徵[22]。先前幾項電
生理學研究或 神經解剖的研究亦指出，漸進式
的axonopathy可能會存在於糖尿病動物模型 [15, 
23, 24]，但誘導糖尿病的時間是一項重要的因
素，影響了神經病理的改變。 [25] 然而，精確
的時間對糖尿病鼠中的神經病變並沒有一致的
結論。 
在電刺激反射實驗中，電刺激會陰感覺神
經分支，在控制組老鼠的反射訊號中，包含了
一個短 (7-8 ms)和長 (27-28 ms)的延遲反應
(latency response)，與先前所研究的3-10 ms和
25-30 ms是一致的[26]。進一步我們發現，長的
延遲反應的平均值，無論是8週或是18週的糖
尿病鼠，相較於其相對應的控制組老鼠，皆有
延遲時間皆輕微的增加，但是這個改變並沒有
達到統計上的差異。我們的結果也與先前的研
究相似，先前其他學者均指出了9週大的糖尿
病鼠表現了異常的膀胱測量，但是在排尿反射
的訊號上並沒有顯著的改變[15]。在 臨床上，
神經傳導研究是一項很重要的方法，用以追蹤
糖尿性神經病變。然而，神經傳導速度有時候
對於糖尿病神經病變、甚至是大直徑纖維神經
病相關的許多病理變化反應不敏感[27]。如果
神經傳導速度明顯的變慢，則暗示了神經的脫
髓鞘性，但這是很少會與糖尿病有關聯性的
[28]。因此，我們毫不意外在糖尿病鼠組中，
沒有偵測到任何神經傳導速率顯著的改變。 
使用慢性糖尿病鼠來當作我們的膀胱病變
模型，有一些的限制。如目前的研究是使用老
鼠來研究下泌尿道功能，雖然老鼠被廣泛性的
用於生理與藥理的下泌尿道研究，但老鼠(和狗)
在排尿的過程中，所展現的間歇階段性的活動
模式(bursting activity)，與在人類(和貓)上觀察
到的括約肌的放鬆形成不太相同。此外，由於
人類與老鼠內EUS activity的神經控制並不相
同，所以現在還不清楚這個實驗結果適不適合
套用到人類身上。 
另一項限制是，會陰感覺神經的電刺激是
否未來適用於不同種類的膀胱病變的糖尿病患
者身上，需進一步瞭解。有些研究指出，糖尿
病膀胱病變主要歸因於自主神經和周圍神經的
漸進式軸突萎縮[16]，而且這種神經病變的嚴
重程度可能會誘導膀胱功能障礙多樣化的症
狀。一般情況下，大部分的糖尿病膀胱病變是
表現排尿障礙。然而，在臨床上約有25%的糖
尿病患者，由於逼尿肌過度活動，可能出現膀
胱儲尿的問題[16]。最近的動物研究報告指出
糖尿病鼠的膀胱病變會經過兩個階段的改變 
[29]：在早期compensative phase會出現膀胱儲
存的問題 (小於九週)和在後期 decompensative 
phase會有膀胱排尿的問題 (大於十二週)。我們
的糖尿病鼠只表現出了排尿問題可能是因為這
些動物有longer induction of diabetes。不過，這
仍舊需要更進一步的去探討會陰神經刺激對於
抑制糖尿病所引起的膀胱機能亢進的可行性 
 
V.結論 
臨床上，保守療法往往無法有效處理糖尿
病患者的下泌尿道功能障礙。本研究結果，藉
由糖尿病動物模式，驗證會陰感覺神經的電刺
激來改善膀胱排空的可行性，目前在動物模式

 We demonstrated previously that unilateral 
electrical stimulation (UniES) of the 
pudendal sensory nerve improved bladder 
emptying in a rat model of urinary 
retention, created by acute bilateral 
transection of the pudendal sensory nerve 
 [ 4 ] . This approach was premised on electrical 
activation of the  ‘ augmenting refl ex ’ where 
excitation of pudendal urethral afferents 
facilitated bladder contraction and emptying 
 [ 5,6 ] . During micturition, fl uid fl ow in the 
urethra evokes fi ring in pudendal afferents 
 [ 7 ] , and this sensory signal activates refl ex 
augmentation of the amplitude and 
frequency of ongoing bladder contractions 
 [ 5,6,8 ] . Conversely, transection of the 
pudendal nerves or intra-urethral 
anaesthesia reduces voiding effi ciency in 
rats  [ 9 ] and humans  [ 10 ] . Thus, electrical 
stimulation provides a potential means to 
restore or amplify the augmenting refl ex in 
cases in urinary retention. 
 In the present study, we sought to 
determine whether bilateral electrical 
stimulation (BiES) of the pudendal sensory 
nerve could further enhance the voiding 
effi ciency (VE) beyond that produced by 
UniES. For example, bilateral stimulation of 
the sacral roots produced bladder inhibition 
with stimulation intensities that were 
sub-threshold for inhibition with unilateral 
stimulation  [ 11 ] . We measured the VE with 
either UniES or BiES of pudendal nerve 
afferents after acute bilateral transection of 
the sensory branch of the pudendal nerve. 
Further, we extended our previous studies to 
determine the effects of UniES and BiES on 
voiding in a partially denervated bladder and 
after acute spinal transection. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 All animal care and experimental protocols 
were reviewed and approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee of Taipei Medical University. 
Female Sprague – Dawley rats ( n  = 23) 
weighing 200 – 250  g were anaesthetized 
with urethane (1.2  g/kg, s.c.). The tail vein 
was catheterized for fl uid and drug 
administration, and the body temperature 
was maintained at 36 – 38  ° C with a 
recirculating water blanket. 
 Two different preparations were used to 
quantify the effects of pudendal afferent 
stimulation on isovolumetric refl ex bladder 
contractions and on bladder emptying. In 
the isometric experiments ( n  = 8) bladder 
volume was maintained by catheterizing the 
bladder via the urethra with a polyethylene 
(PE) tube 50 (0.58  mm internal diameter and 
0.96  mm outside diameter) tied in place 
with a ligature around the external urethral 
orifi ce. The voiding experiments ( n  = 15) 
were performed with continuous 
transvesical infusion cystometry and an 
open urethra. In all experiments, the urinary 
bladder was exposed via a midline 
abdominal incision, and a PE tube 50 was 
inserted into the bladder lumen for bladder 
pressure measurements. The bladder end of 
the PE tube was heated to form a collar, 
passed through a small incision at the apex 
of the bladder dome, and secured with a 
purse-string suture. The bladder was fi lled at 
0.12  mL/min with physiological saline at 
room temperature. Two insulated silver 
wire electrodes (0.05  mm diameter) with 
exposed tips were inserted into the lateral 
aspects of the mid-urethra to record the 
electromyogram (EMG) from the EUS. Finally, 
the abdominal wall was closed with nylon 
sutures. 
 The PE tube was connected via a three-way 
stopcock to an infusion pump and a pressure 
transducer (P23XL-1, Becton Dickinson, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to measure the 
intravesical pressure and control the bladder 
volume. The intravesical pressure and EUS 
EMG were amplifi ed, fi ltered and sampled at 
5  kHz (Biopac MP 36, BIOPAC Systems, 
Santa Barbara, CA, USA). 
 The sensory branches of the pudendal 
nerves were transected bilaterally in each 
rat. The sensory branches of the pudendal 
nerves were exposed via a posterior 
approach by incising the distal portions of 
the gluteus major muscles. The ilium and 
sacrum were separated, the sensory 
branches of the pudendal nerves were 
identifi ed through blunt dissection  [ 12,13 ] , 
carefully isolated, marked with a silk suture 
and then transected with fi ne scissors. The 
proximal ends of the transected pudendal 
sensory branches were both mounted with 
bipolar cuff electrodes for electrical 
stimulation. Regulated-current, cathodic, 
monophasic pulses were applied with a 
pulse duration of 0.1  ms, an amplitude of 
0.025 – 0.3  mA, and a frequency of 1 – 50  Hz 
via two stimulators (Model 2100, A-M 
Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA). The 
stimulators were controlled by a LabView 
(National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) 
program that sampled and analysed the 
bladder pressure signal and generated a 
voltage signal to each of the stimulators via 
a digital-to-analogue converter (USB-6212, 
National Instruments). The stimulator(s) was 
triggered when the cystometric pressure 
reached a preset threshold. 
 To establish the appropriate range of 
stimulation currents, the current threshold 
required to evoke the pudendal-pudendal 
refl ex (i.e. an EUS EMG evoked by 
stimulation of the proximal transected 
pudendal sensory branch) was measured 
( n  = 8) with stimuli applied at 1  Hz  [ 4 ] . 
 After bilateral transection of the sensory 
branch of the pudendal nerves, the bladder 
was fi lled via the urethral catheter, and the 
infusion was stopped when the fi rst 
isovolumetric bladder contraction appeared. 
Electrical stimulation was automatically 
applied at the onset of every other 
isovolumetric bladder contraction, beginning 
when the bladder contraction pressure 
exceeded 50  cmH 2 O and lasting for 30  s 
( Fig.  1 ). The laterality alternated between

(BP) EUS EMG ( Fig.  2 ) was calculated to 
determine whether pudendal afferent 
stimulation produced effects on EUS activity 
 [ 9 ] . 
 All data are presented as means  ± standard 
deviation. Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was 
used to identify factors that infl uenced 
cystometric variables and  post hoc paired 
comparisons were made using Tukey ’ s 
honest signifi cant difference (HSD) 
(SigmaStat, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Power 
analyses were also conducted to determine 
the probability of rejecting the null 
hypothesis when it was, indeed, false. 
 RESULTS 
 The pudendal – EUS refl ex was evoked by 
1  Hz UniES of the proximal end of the 
transected sensory branch of the pudendal 
nerve, and the minimum current amplitude 
to elicit an EMG response in the EUS refl ex 
ranged from 0.01 to 0.05  mA (0.03  ± 
0.02  mA,  n  = 8). 
 Examples of the effects of UniES and BiES 
of the proximal end of the transected 
sensory branch of the pudendal nerve(s) on 
ongoing isovolumetric bladder contractions 
are shown in  Fig.  1 . The 30  s epochs of 
stimulation at 2  Hz were triggered when the 
bladder pressure exceeded 50  cmH 2 O. Both 
UniES and BiES, with stimulation amplitudes 
ranging from 0.025 to 0.1  mA, appeared to 
increase the duration of the contractions, 
and thus the contraction area, as compared 
with contractions without stimulation. 
 The effects of UniES and BiES at different 
frequencies and amplitudes on the area of 
isovolumetric bladder contractions ( n  = 396 
trials across eight rats) are summarized in 
 Table  1 . The mean normalized contraction 
area increased to 104 – 147% of the control 
area across all tested stimulation variables. 
A three-factor  ANOVA indicated that the 
contraction area was dependent on both the 
stimulation laterality (i.e. control, UniES 
and BiES,  P  = 0.04) and the stimulation 
amplitude ( P  = 0.006), but the results of the 
present study did not demonstrate a 
signifi cant effect of the stimulus frequency 
( P  = 0.42), of the interaction term between 
site and frequency ( P  = 0.77), or of the 
interaction term between amplitude and 
frequency ( P  = 0.420). Therefore, all data 
were combined across frequency, and the 
two-factor  ANOVA indicated that, again, the 
contraction area was dependent on both the 
stimulation laterality ( P  = 0.004) and the

comparisons between amplitudes did not 
identify specifi c amplitudes that produced 
larger VEs than any other amplitude. 
 After BST, the pelvic nerves ( n  = 6 rats) were 
successively transected to determine 
whether enhancement of bladder emptying 
by pudendal afferent stimulation was 
preserved in a partially denervated bladder. 
Examples of cystometrograms after 
unilateral and bilateral pelvic nerve 
transection, with and without concomitant 
electrical stimulation of pudendal afferents, 
are shown in  Fig.  3A , and voiding 
effi ciencies are summarized in  Fig.  3B . 
 Unilateral pelvic nerve transection, 
conducted after BST, further reduced the 
bladder CA and the bladder CD, and the 
VE decreased from 18 to 8% ( P  < 0.05). 
Both UniES and BiES increased the VE 
signifi cantly, to  ≈ 22 and  ≈ 31%, respectively 
( Fig.  3B ), but there was no signifi cant 
difference between unilateral and bilateral 
stimulation ( P  = 0.084, 1  −  β  = 0.7). 
 After subsequent contralateral (i.e. bilateral) 
pelvic nerve transection, all micturition 
contractions were eliminated and replaced 
by continuous small contractions with 
overfl ow urination occurring in a drip-like 
fashion, and VE was only  ≈ 2%. Neither 
UniES nor BiES augmented bladder 
contractions or improved bladder emptying 
after bilateral pelvic nerve transection. 
 After BST, the spinal cord ( n  = 3 rats) was 
transected at T 9 – T 10 (SCT) to investigate the 
refl ex pathway mediating the enhancement 
of bladder emptying by pudendal sensory 
nerve stimulation. Examples of 
cystometrograms after SCT, with and 
without concomitant electrical stimulation, 
are shown in  Fig.  4A , and voiding 
effi ciencies are summarized in  Fig.  4B . SCT 
caused impaired micturition with smaller 
contraction areas and shorter ICIs, and VE 
was signifi cantly reduced, from  ≈ 23 to 
 ≈ 6% after SCT. Subsequently, VE was 
increased signifi cantly by either UniES or 
BiES, to  ≈ 16 and  ≈ 18%, respectively, and 
there was no signifi cant difference between 
unilateral and bilateral stimulation ( P  = 
0.752, 1  −  β  = 0.22). 
 DISCUSSION 
 Both UniES and BiES of the transected 
pudendal sensory nerve(s) increased the 
duration (area) of isovolumetric bladder 
contractions and increased VE during 
cystometry with an open urethra from 
 ≈ 22% after bilateral sensory nerve 
transection to 46 – 62%, as compared with 
69% under control conditions. Further, the 
improved bladder emptying by pudendal 
afferent electrical stimulation was preserved 
after acute unilateral (but not bilateral) 
pelvic nerve transection or thoracic spinal 
transection. 
 The VE in intact anaesthetized rats before 
any nerve transections or electrical 
stimulation was 69%, which was lower than 
the  ≈ 98 – 99% VE measured in conscious 
animals  [ 14 ] , and VE was reduced to only 
22% after bilateral sensory nerve 
transection, supporting the pivotal role of 
pudendal sensory feedback in effi cient 
voiding  [ 9 ] . Unilateral pudendal afferent 
stimulation dramatically improved the VE 
and bilateral stimulation produced an 
additional 4 – 5% increase in the VE, thereby 
restoring VE to the level measured before 
any nerve transections, but to values less 
than the VE measured in conscious animals. 
This limitation presumably resulted from 
anaesthesia limiting bladder emptying both 
in control conditions and with stimulation. 
This assumption was supported by other 
studies  [ 15,16 ] where VE restored using 
electrical stimulation in anaesthetized 
animals was generally no better than 75%. 
Although anaesthetic effects were a 
limitation of the present studies, urethane is 
 ‘ the most suitable anaesthetic for 
physiological experiments that require 
demonstration of refl ex micturition ’  [ 17 ] . 
 Both UniES and BiES increased the durations 
of both the bladder contraction and EUS 
bursting, implying that the sensory feedback 
generated by pudendal afferent stimulation 
not only amplifi ed bladder activation but 
also contributed to patterning of the EUS 
bursting activity, and this is consistent with 
the physiological roles of pudendal afferent 
feedback during voiding  [ 9 ] . The burst 
activity refl ects the rhythmic opening and 
closing of the outlet to produce the pulsatile 
fl ow of urine  [ 18,19 ] , and is essential to 
achieve effi cient voiding in rodents  [ 20 ] . The 
increased duration of EUS EMG bursts 
indicated that the urethra was open for a 
longer time and this could have contributed 
to the increased VE produced by UniES and 
BiES. In addition, the increased bladder CD 
generated by pudendal afferent stimulation 
corroborated the existence of a urethra-to-
bladder refl ex  [ 21,22 ] where urine fl ow 
activates urethral afferents that, in turn, 
augment bladder contraction. 
 Activation of the augmenting refl ex by 
UniES signifi cantly increased VE after an 
acute unilateral pelvic neurotomy, and BiES 
only modestly increased the voiding 
effi ciency ( Fig.  3B ). These results indicated 
that unilateral sensory activity generated by 
UniES was probably transmitted bilaterally 
to parasympathetic efferents innervating 
the bladder. This assertion is supported 
by previous histological and 
electrophysiological studies. Primary afferent 
axons from the pudendal nerve project 
bilaterally but with ipsilateral dominance 
 [ 12 ] , and neurons and/or axons passing 
through the dorsal commissure make 
monosynaptic and polysynaptic excitatory 
connections with contralateral 
parasympathetic preganglionic neurons 
 [ 23,24 ] . As expected, the micturition refl ex 
was totally abolished in rats after bilateral 
transection of the pelvic nerve, and there 
were no effects of pudendal afferent 
stimulation. 
 After acute spinal transection, bladder 
voiding was still improved by either UniES 
or BiES, and while overall VE was lower, the 
effect sizes of stimulation were similar to 
those measured with an intact spinal cord. 
These results imply that the neuronal 
circuitry recruited by electrical stimulation 
to augment the bladder emptying refl ex 
resides within the lumbo-sacral spinal 
segments, and are consistent with previous 
results in cats after acute  [ 15 ] or chronic 
 [ 25 ] spinal transection. Spinal studies in 
humans have also demonstrated that 
intra-urethral electrical stimulation can 
generate refl ex contraction of the bladder 
 [ 26,27 ] . 
 One limitation of the present study was the 
use of rats to investigate lower urinary 
tract function. Although rats are widely used 
for physiological and pharmacological 
studies of the lower urinary tract  [ 28 ] , they 
(and dogs) exhibit phasic patterns of EUS 
activity during voiding, by contrast to the 
(complete) relaxation of the sphincter 
observed in humans (and cats). Therefore, 
it is not clear whether the present results 
will translate to humans, where neural 
control of EUS activity differs from that in 
the rat.

This study evaluated a recently-developed BPNI rat model
to examine the role of the 5-HT1A receptor in controlling EUS
activity during the micturition reflex. Systemic administration
of 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT receptor agonist, or WAY-100635, a
5-HT1A receptor antagonist, activated or blocked 5-HT1A re-
ceptors, respectively. Two different measurement methods
assessed the effects of the drug on bladder and urethral func-
tions: 1) the simultaneous recordings of transvesical pressure
under isovolumetric conditions [isovolumetric intravesical pres-
sure (IVP)] and urethral perfusion pressure (UPP); and 2) the
simultaneous recordings of transvesical pressure during continu-
ously isotonic transvesical infusion with an open urethra (isotonic
IVP) and EUS-EMG. The leak point pressure (LPP) test was also
used to evaluate the resistance of the urethral continence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental preparation. The Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Taipei Medical University and Hospital approved the
experiment protocols involving the use of animals in this study.
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n 48) weighing 290–360 g were used
in this study. The rats were divided into two equal groups: the normal
control (NC) and BPNI groups. The NC rats received a sham opera-
tion that did not damage the pudendal nerves, whereas BPNI rats
underwent bilateral pudendal nerve transection. A description of the
surgical procedure appears in a previous study (35). After the 6-wk
recovery period, all rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg sc).
The femoral vein was catheterized for fluid and drug administration,
and the body temperature was maintained at 36–38°C with a heating
lamp.
Two different preparations were used to quantify the effects of drug
on bladder and urethral functions. The first series of experiments (NC
and BPNI, n  6 in each group) involved simultaneous recordings of
isovolumetric IVP and UPP. This approach permitted the functional
separation of bladder and urethral activity without the risk of surgical
damage to the innervation in the bladder neck region. The procedure
for simultaneous recordings of isovolumetric IVP and UPP was
performed as previously reported (2). The bladder and proximal
urethra were exposed via a midline abdominal incision. A custom-
designed, triple-lumen catheter (8-Fr tube) containing two polyethyl-
ene catheters of different sizes (PE-160 and PE-50) connected to a
pipette tip was then inserted through the bladder dome, and the pipette
tip was placed securely in the bladder neck. The outer lumen was
connected to a pressure transducer for isovolumetric IVP monitoring.
The middle lumen was connected to an infusion pump for continuous
saline infusion to urethra. The inner lumen (PE-50) was connected to
a pressure transducer for monitoring the UUP. The abdomen was then
closed with sutures. After surgery, the bladder was filled with 0.7–1.0
ml of normal saline via the outer lumen of the catheter, and the
isovolumetric IVP was recorded throughout the experiment. The
urethra was perfused with saline (0.075 ml/min) using an infusion
pump under an open urethra condition. The isovolumetric IVP and
UPP were recorded simultaneously, and the experimental drug was
given during the recording.
The second series of experiments (NC and BPNI, n  12 in each
group) was conducted with simultaneous recordings of isotonic trans-
vesical infusion of IVP with an open urethra (isotonic IVP) and
EUS-EMG. The transvesical infusion was performed at an infusion
rate of 0.123 ml/min with saline, and the urethra was opened, allowing
elimination of fluid during micturition. The procedure for simultane-
ously recording isotonic IVP and EUS-EMG was performed as
reported previously (13, 35, 36).
All recorded data were first amplified and sampled at 3 kHz
(Biopac MP 150, BIOPAC Systems). Several isovolumetric IVP and
UPP parameters were measured, including the frequency of isovolu-
metric bladder contraction, the maximum amplitude of reflex bladder
contraction, the baseline UPP between reflex bladder contractions,
and the baseline of high-frequency oscillations (baseline HFOs) in
UPP during reflex bladder contractions (Fig. 1) (2, 46).
Various cystometric parameters were calculated during the simul-
taneous recordings of isotonic IVP and EUS-EMG (13, 35): 1) the
volume threshold, i.e., the volume of saline sufficient to evoke the first
voiding contraction; 2) the intercontraction interval, i.e., the interval
between two bladder contractions; 3) the contraction amplitude, i.e.,
the maximal pressure during voiding; and 4) the bladder contraction
duration during voiding. The urodynamic parameters of the residual
volume, voided volume, voiding efficiency, and critical pressure were
also obtained. The residual volume was the volume of saline with-
drawn through the intravesical catheter after micturition. The col-

volumetric conditions (isovolumetric IVP; top) and urethral
perfusion pressure (UPP; bottom) in an anesthetized rat
without any treatment. The isovolumetric contraction of
bladder was associated with relaxation of the urethra and
high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) of urethral pressure
appearing during urethral relaxation. The recordings were
quantified by the baseline UPP, the baseline HFOs, the
maximum amplitude of reflex bladder contraction, the du-
ration of reflex bladder contraction, as well as the frequency
of isovolumetric bladder contraction.

LPP tests were conducted in all BPNI rats before and after successive
bilateral pelvic (branch to iliococcygeous/pubococcygeous muscles)
and bilateral hypogastric neurotomies to determine the contribution of
different nerves to urethral outlet resistance. The effects of drug on
LPPs were assessed 2030 min after each transection.
Statistical analysis. This study presents all data as means  SD.
One-way ANOVA was used to compare the parameters obtained from
isovolumetric and isotonic IVPs, UPP, EUS-EMG, and LPP. ANOVA
was followed by Student-Newman Keuls post hoc test using Sigma
Stat (SPSS, Chicago, IL), and a value of P  0.05 was considered
significant in all analyses.

IVP and UPP in NC and BPNI rats. Experimental results show
that, in both NC and BPNI rats, isovolumetric contraction of
bladder was associated with urethral relaxation. The HFOs of
urethral pressure were present during urethral relaxation in
both the control and BPNI rats (Fig. 1, control rat with no drug
treatment). Although the basic pattern of isovolumetric IVP
and UPP was similar in NC and BPNI rats with 8-OH-DPAT
or WAY-100635 treatment, there were marked quantized dif-
ferences. Table 1 summarizes all of the isovolumetric IVP and
UPP parameters obtained from NC and BPNI rats before and
after drug treatment.
The rats showed several significant changes following
BPNI, including decreases in the baseline UPP and the baseline
HFOs (compared to NC rat, P  0.05). No significant differ-
ences were observed in isovolumetric IVP measurements,
indicating that urethral resistance during continence and void-
ing were both reduced, and bladder activity was unaffected
(Table 1). 8-OH-DPAT intravenously administrated to BPNI
rats significantly increased the baseline UPP and the frequency
and duration of isovolumetric bladder contraction and de-
creased the baseline HFOs, compared with rats before treat-
ment. This implies that 8-OH-DPAT markedly enhanced ure-
thral resistance during continence and the isovolumetric
bladder activity, while significantly decreasing urethral resis-
tance during voiding. Similar effects appeared in NC rat with
8-OH-DPAT treatment. Conversely, WAY-100635 adminis-
trated after 8-OH-DPAT reduced the baseline UPP and the
frequency and duration of isovolumetric bladder contraction
and increased the baseline HFOs in both NC and BPNI rats
(Table 1). However, some parameters in BPNI rats did not
reach statistical significance.
Typical pattern of isotonic IVP and EUS-EMG in NC rats
before drug treatment. Figure 2 depicts the typical isotonic IVP
and EUS-EMG measurements in NC rats with no treatment.
The rats exhibited micturition contractions during isotonic
intravesical infusion of saline. EUS-EMG exhibited low-am-
plitude tonic activity during the initial filling phase of the IVP
or between micturition contractions, but the activity markedly
increased in amplitude during bladder contractions. The single
micturition contraction of the bladder includes three phases of
isotonic IVP (29): phase 1, the rising phase, defined as the
duration between the point at which a curve begins rising
sharply and the point at which HFO waves begin; phase 2,
HFO phase, defined as the duration between the points at
which the HFO waves begin and end; and phase 3, rebound
and falling phase, defined as the duration between the point at
which the HFO waves end and the point at which the falling
curve flattens (Fig. 2B). A long period of bursting on EUS-
EMG appeared during each micturition contraction, which
lasted from the end of phase 1 throughout the entire duration of
phase 2, as shown in Fig. 2C. The BP was characterized by
HFO waves in IVP and could be divided into nonvoiding and
voiding burst activities (Fig. 2C). The nonvoiding burst activity
in phase 1 usually appeared for a short period (0.87 s) and
was not accompanied by any oscillation waves in IVP. How-
ever, the voiding burst activity in phase 2 usually lasted for
35 s and was accompanied by a series of HFOs superimposed
on the IVP. Burst discharges in the BP showed clusters of
high-frequency spikes (corresponding to an active period)
separated by periods of quiescence (corresponding to a silent
period), as shown in Fig. 2D.
Effect of 8-OH-DPAT on isotonic IVP in NC and BPNI rats.
Figure 3 shows typical isotonic IVP examples of NC and BPNI
rats before and after 8-OH-DPAT treatment (0.3 mg/kg iv).
Figure 4 compares the measured bladder activity parameters
between NC and BPNI rats before and after drug administra-
tion. In rats after BPNI, the bladder contraction duration was
significantly increased, while the bladder contraction ampli-
tude and the voiding efficiency were reduced compared with
NC rats (Fig. 4, B, C, and G). The lower voiding efficiency
appeared to significantly increase residual volume and decrease

significantly increased the average LPP of BPNI rats. LPP
measurements were further conducted in BPNI rats following
acute successive transection of the bilateral pelvic nerves (PN
transection) and bilateral hypogastric nerves (HN transection).
Results indicate that transecting the bilateral PNs slightly
decreased the average LPP value (22.80  2.74 cmH2O)
compared with the value (25.85  2.92 cmH2O) before nerve
transection. Subsequent transection of the bilateral hypogastric
nerves further decreased the LPP value (18.40  1.29 cmH2O,
P  0.05). However, the LPP value significantly increased
with 8-OH-DPAT treatment in BPNI rats with either PN
transection or subsequent HN transection.
DISCUSSION
This study shows that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in
BPNI rats with 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A agonist, significantly
increased urethral outlet resistance during the storage phase
and decreased resistance during the voiding phase, as evi-
denced by an increase in the baseline UPP and a decrease in the
baseline HFOs. Similarly, LPP testing revealed an improve-
ment in the urethral continence following treatment with
8-OH-DPAT. Conversely, rats treated with WAY-100635, a
5-HT1A antagonist, produced effects opposite to those pro-
duced by 8-OH-DPAT. Importantly, 8-OH-DPAT significantly
improved the voiding function by altering the pattern of EUS-
EMG burst activity and bladder activity during continuously
isotonic transvesical infusion. The results of 8-OH-DPAT
treatment included marked decreases in the frequency of EMG
burst discharges, bladder contraction amplitude, and residual
volume, and significant increases in the BP, silent period,
bladder contraction duration, and voiding efficiency. All results
indicate that 8-OH-DPAT significantly improved functions

after acute nerve transection or administering a neuromuscular
blocking agent (11, 35). The present results confirm that
8-OH-DPAT significantly increased the amplitude of EUS-
EMG by 1015% during the filling phase. This is consistent
with the effect of the 5-HT1A agonist on urethral function
enhancing EUS activity during the storage phase of the mic-
turition cycle in normal rats and in clinical patients (6, 10, 40).
However, the EUS-EMG activity during the voiding phase was
altered by 8-OH-DPAT, for which no report has appeared in
any clinical studies. This discrepancy may be attributed to
several factors. First, the effect of the drug on EUS activity
may differ between species. This possibility has been found
between cats and rats (38, 43). In addition, new neural
pathways might appear following injury to the pudendal
nerve, which could influence the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on
the EUS.
8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg iv) significantly altered the patterns
associated with burst activity. The complete change in EUS-
EMG during phase 1 could not be attributed to a drug over-
dose. This is because the change was produced in anesthetized
normal rats even with low doses (0.03 mg/kg) of 8-OH-DPAT
(unpublished results). In phase 1, nearly the entire tonic EUS-
EMG was transformed into burst activity; however, the rising
IVP was not accompanied by any HFO waves. This could be
explained by the possibility that 8-OH-DPAT has a significant
excitatory effect, triggering the EUS burst center in spinal cord,
causing the appearance of EUS burst activity before the open-
ing of bladder neck/internal sphincter innervated by hypogas-
tric nerve. Previous studies have indicated that 8-OH-DPAT
acts on at least two discrete sites of the central nervous system:
in spinal cord, and at the supraspinal level (28). In addition,
recent research has shown that the burst activity of EUS-EMG
in intact rats is generated in the segment of the spinal cord
between T8–9 and L3–4 (10). Similarly, the burst activity of
periurethral striated muscles for the ejaculation reflex also
appeared in male rats in the L3–4 spinal segment (16, 47).
These findings imply that 8-OH-DPAT has a significant excit-
atory effect on somatic pathways in the spinal cord, triggering
the early generation of EUS burst activity during the voiding
phase in BPNI rats.

among NC (A and B) and BPNI (C and D) rats before (A and C) and after (B
and D) 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg) treatment. Compared with NC rats, the
number of SPs increased in BPNI rats, but no significant change appeared in
the amplitude. In either NC or BPNI rats, the amplitude of the bladder HFO
waves and the number of SPs were significantly reduced after drug adminis-
tration, and the duration of the SP increased.

On the other hand, 8-OH-DPAT increased the baseline UPP
of isovolumetric IVP, but decreased the volume threshold of
isotonic IVP. These results appear contradictory; however,
they could be explained by the involvement of 8-OH-DPAT in
the modulation of continence and micturition reflexes. During
the bladder filling phase, 8-OH-DPAT elevated the urethral
resistance via the enhancement of the bladder-somatic and
bladder-hypogastric reflex. Meanwhile, the drug also enhanced
bladder afferent activity, acting on the micturition switching
circuit, thereby reducing the bladder volume threshold for
triggering micturition.
Treatment with 8-OH-DPAT also reduced the amplitude of
bladder contractions and the critical pressure at the onset of
HFOs during isotonic IVP in NC and BPNI rats (Fig. 4, B and
H). These decreases may be the results of a reduction in
urethral resistance during the voiding phase rather than the
drug inhibiting the contractile ability of the bladder. Simulta-
neous recordings of isovolumetric IVP and UPP confirmed this
possibility, indicating that both NC and BPNI rats exhibited a
lower baseline of HFOs in UPP and a higher frequency of
isovolumetric bladder contraction after 8-OH-DPAT treatment,
without changes in the amplitude of isovolumetric bladder
contractions (Table 1). Reduced urethral resistance during the
voiding phase might have been the result of drug-enhanced
relaxation of the urethral smooth muscle or an extension of the
silent period of the EUS burst. This explanation is indirectly
supported by the fact that the shorter urethra and thinner EUS
overlaying the urethra of female rats might easily cause lower
urethral outlet resistance during the opening of the urethra (7,
37, 39). Therefore, it could be concluded that treatment with
8-OH-DPAT leads to marked decreases in the amplitude of
bladder contractions and the critical pressure at the onset of
HFOs, resulting from the reduction in the urethral resistance
rather than the bladder activity.
The phasic relaxation of EUS may reduce urethral resis-
tance. Our results show that 8-OH-DPAT increased EUS burst
activity in phase 1; however, the baseline UPP was not re-
duced, but increased, by the drug. This conflict could be
explained by the appearance of EUS burst before the opening
of bladder neck/internal sphincter and the sustained activation
of urethral smooth muscle by 8-OH-DPAT until the opening of
the bladder neck/internal sphincter. Urethra resistance in-
creased by the activation of urethral smooth muscle might
exceed the decrease introduced by the phasic relaxation of
EUS, leading to an increase in baseline UPP.
In summary, this study showed that the activation of 5-HT1A
receptors by the systemic administration of 8-OH-DPAT im-
proves urethral continence by elevating the storage phase of
urethral outlet resistance. Furthermore, the drug increased
bladder voiding efficiency by lowering the voiding phase of
urethral resistance and enhancing the bladder and EUS-EMG
burst activity.
Perspectives and Significance
In this study, EUS-EMG activity reemerged but was abnor-
mal in rats 6 wk after BPNI, and NC and BPNI exhibited a
number of differences in EUS activity after 8-OH-DPAT
treatment (Table 2). This increased the possibility that the
neural pathways controlling the EUS might be altered. This is
clinically relevant because, for patients with SUI induced by
pudendal nerve damage, drugs such as duloxetine could exhibit
different effects (30). This is due to the fact that “new” neural
pathways might be controlling the EUS, and these pathways
might have different responses to 5-HT receptor activation.
However, further research would be needed to confirm these
possibilities.

Abstract 
Background/Purpose: This study examined the effects of a 5-HT1A receptor 
agonist (8-OH-DPAT) on external urethral sphincter (EUS) activity in urethane-
anesthetized rats. Methods: An EUS electromyogram (EMG) and intravesical 
pressure (IVP) were simultaneously recorded during continuous cystometrographic 
(CMG) monitoring, to provide a quantitative evaluation of EUS activity and urethral 
urodynamics of voiding. Results: When examining the EUS burst activity, durations 
of the active (AP) and silent periods (SP) as a function of the time axis respectively 
exhibited concave- and convex-shaped curves. The burst discharges of the EUS-EMG 
were divided into non-voiding and voiding burst activities based on the oscillation 
waves of the IVP, which were located in phases 1 and 2 of the IVP. After 8-OH-
DPAT treatment, the entire burst period (BP) in phases 1 to 2 of the IVP was 
significantly prolonged. The average SP in both phases 1 and 2 significantly increased 
but the average APs were not affected. Urodynamic results showed decreases in the 
volume threshold, contraction amplitude, and residual volume as well as an increase 
in the contraction duration. In addition, the amplitude of bladder high-frequency 
oscillatory waves in the IVP and the average urethral flow rate were reduced, but the 
entire voiding efficiency increased. Conclusion: The influences of 8-OH-DPAT on 
EUS burst activity and urodynamics were exactly detected by the sophisticated EMG 
analytic design, and the results could be a reference for the pharmacological treatment 
on patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction.

Introduction 
Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is one of the most common forms of 
incontinence among middle-aged women 1. Serotonergic agents (e.g., Duloxetine) are 
used to treat SUI in patients 2. However, recent studies continue to investigate the 
effects of serotonergic ligands on the bladder activity in animals. Serotonin (5-
hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) was characterized into 14 structurally different 5-HT 
receptors in mammalian species, which are divided into seven subfamilies (5-HT1 to 
5-HT7) 3. Studies indicated that some 5-HT receptors, i.e., 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3 
receptors, are involved in the control of lower urinary tract (LUT) function. These 5-
HT receptors and terminals are located on spinal cord areas that contain afferent and 
efferent components of LUT neural control centers 4. These receptors seem to 
modulate all of the pathways involved in the control of micturition, including the 
parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatic pathways 5. 
The 5-HT1A receptor is one of the most extensively investigated agents and has 
been used in various animal pharmacological experiments including the rat, guinea 
pig, and cat 3. However, contradictory results spurred various interpretations of the 
function of this receptor subtype in different animal species. A great deal of our 
original understanding of 5-HT mechanisms involved in controlling micturition came 
from cat experiments. For example, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-
DPAT) significantly increased both the bladder volume threshold and the inter-
contraction interval, and thus moderately inhibited bladder activity in cat experiments 
6,7. However, the bladder-inhibition effect is exactly the opposite of the bladder-
excitatory effects of 8-OH-DPAT reported in rats 8,9. Since the rat model has now 
become the main species for investigating urine storage and micturition reflexes, it is 
essential to precisely define the regulatory functions of 5-HT1A receptors in the LUT 
of rats.

Although recent studies continue to investigate the effects of 5-HT ligands on 
bladder activity, most rat studies focus on measuring urodynamic parameters, to 
detect the volume threshold (VT), changes in the volume threshold, bladder pressure, 
voided volume (VV), and residual volume (RV) 10-12. Since external urethral 
sphincter (EUS) burst activity plays an important role in the micturition reflex in the 
rat 13, the electrophysiological effects of 5-HT on EUS activity require further 
investigation. In our recent studies, we developed a novel experimental design to 
analyze EUS burst discharges in urethane-anesthetized rats after nerve damage 14. In 
the present study, we continue exploiting this method to examine the role of the 5-
HT1A receptor in controlling the micturition reflex by activating 5-HT1A receptors 
with 8-OH-DPAT (a 5HT receptor agonist) in urethane-anesthetized female rats. In 
addition, a new experimental design was used to analyze patterns of the EUS-EMG 
burst discharges in time domain. Both external urethral sphincter electrometrography 
(EUS-EMG) and intravesical pressure (IVP) were measured during continuous 
cystometrography (CMG) to provide a quantitative evaluation of interactions 
between EUS activity and urodynamics during micturition.  
 
Materials and Methods 
General Preparation 
Twenty-one female Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 290~360 g) were used in 
this study. All rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg, s.c.). The body 
temperature was maintained at 36~38 °C by a heating lamp. In addition, the femoral 
vein was catheterized for fluid and drug administration. The entire procedure was 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical 
University.

significantly prolonged, which is in parallel with the occurrence of HFOs in IVP (Fig. 
2b, d). Observations at the urethral outlet showed that urine was emitted in a long 
stream-like pattern during this phase. On the other hand, the amplitude of HFO waves 
in the IVP during this phase was significantly reduced compared to the controls, as 
shown in Fig. 3. In phase 3, the voiding burst activity of EUS-EMG was transformed 
into a tonic discharge, and gradually decreased (Fig. 2f). Similar to phase 1 of the IVP, 
bladder contractions showed a prolonged and slowly descending IVP. But the rebound 
pressure detected in control rats had almost disappeared or was unclear after drug 
administration. 
The Pattern of Burst Activity 
The 5-HT receptor agonist (8-OH-DPAT) induced a long BP lasting from 
phases 1 to 2 (Fig. 2b). When examining the distribution of the duration of the burst 
discharges in detail, the burst discharges were transformed into two curves: SP and 
AP curves. The curves are the function of the durations of the AP and SP to the 
corresponding time axis which was represented as the middle of the duration of each 
AP or SP, as shown in Fig. 4a. Typical patterns of SP and AP curves after vehicle 
and 8-OH-DPAT treatments are respectively shown in Fig. 4b and 4c. In most cases 
(n=17 of 21 rats), vehicle treatment, the AP curve exhibited a concave-like shape 
while the SP curve showed a convex shape (Fig 4b). During the non-voiding burst 
activity in phase 1, the AP and SP curves showed an asymptotic decrease (starting 
from 100 ms) and increase (starting from 60 ms), respectively, until to the end of 
phase 1. At the beginning of phase 2 or the middle of phase 2, the AP and SP curves 
almost reached the bottom around 60 ms and a plateau around 100 ms, respectively. 
Finally, the AP curve at the end of phase 2 asymptotically ascended to around 80 ms, 
whereas the SP curve asymptotically descended close to the initial value of the curve.

After 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg) treatment, the entire AP and SP curves were 
both elongated approximately 2.5-fold that of the control (Fig. 4c). The initial value 
of the AP curve was elevated to 150 ms, and then the AP curve exhibited an 
asymptotic decrease to the end of phase 1 and reached the bottom around 60 ms to 
the end of phase 2. In contrast to the control AP curve, AP after treatment did not 
show an ascending phase at the end of phase 2. The SP curve showed a sharply 
increasing curve which soon formed a plateau at the beginning of the curve. The 
plateau was elevated up to around 150 ms and lasted from phase 1 to the end of phase 
2. During the plateau period, there were several sporadic SPs with very long 
durations which reached 300 ms in some cases. 
Measurements of EUS-EMG and Bladder Activity Parameters 
The drug effects on the relationship between bladder activity and EUS-EMG 
parameters were determined during continuous CMGs in rats. The summary of 
changes in the urodyanmic and EUS-EMG parameters in rats (n=12) after 
intravenous administration of vehicle and 8-OH-DPAT is tabulated in Table I and II, 
respectively. 
During the CMGs, the average VT for stimulating voiding significantly 
decreased after 5-HT treatment compared to that of the vehicle (Table I). Moreover, 
the average maximal CA during voiding was significantly reduced after 5-HT 
treatment. 8-OH-DPAT slightly reduced the average VV from 0.44 to 0.39 ml, but 
there was no significant difference compared to the vehicle. In addition, the CD 
significantly increased after administering the 5-HT receptor agonist (23.94±2.40 vs. 
31.92±7.63 sec, p<0.05). The RV significantly decreased in rats with 5-HT treatment 
(0.05±0.02 ml) compared to values (0.19±0.03 ml) in vehicle. The average VE, i.e.,

the ratio of VV to VT, in rats after 5-HT treatment had markedly increased from 
about 68% to 88%. 
On the other hand, EUS-EMG measurements in rats with vehicle treatment, the 
average duration of the BP in phase 1 (0.86±0.47 s) was much shorter than that in 
phase 2 (3.91±0.50 s) (Table II). In addition, the SP in phase 1 (69.1±5.4 ms) was 
much shorter than that in phase 2 (98.5±3.4 ms), but the AP in phase 1 (99.4±3.8 ms) 
was much longer (65.6±2.9 ms) than that in phase 2. After 8-OH-DPAT treatment, 
the average durations of the BP in phases 1 and 2 had significant increased by 
approximately 4- and 2-fold of the vehicle, respectively. Moreover, the average 
durations of the SP were significantly increased in phase 1 (by about 1.8-fold that of 
the vehicle) and in phase 2 (by about 1.7-fold that of the control), but no significant 
difference was found in the average durations of the AP in phases 1 or 2 compared to 
the vehicle. In addition, the average frequency of bursting discharge (FB) and the 
ratio of the Num to the BP significantly decreased in both phases 1 (from 5.95 to 4.48 
Hz) and 2 (from 6.05 to 4.19 Hz). The averaged urethral flow rate (VV/TSP) in phase 
2 was significantly reduced by 8-OH-DPAT. 
Discussion 
The present results indicate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors by 8-OH-DPAT 
significantly affected the pattern of EUS-EMG burst activity and urodynamic 
parameters in female urethane-anesthetized rats. In control EUS-EMG, we detected a 
short period of burst discharges before the oscillation waves of IVP, called the non-
voiding burst activity. After drug administration (0.3 mg/ kg, i.v.), the entire tonic 
EUS-EMG in phase 1 of the IVP was almost completely transformed into non-voiding 
burst activity in which the duration of the SP increased. EMG activity occurring 
during bladder filling would originate from striated muscles rather than smooth

muscles as noted in our previous studies, because EMG activity was eliminated after 
acute nerve transection or administration of a neuromuscular blockade agent 14. Other 
studies showed that 8-OH-DPAT acts on at least at two different and independent 
sites of the central nerve system (CNS): one at the spinal cord and the other at the 
supraspinal level 15. Recent studies indicated that burst activity was detected in rats 
with acute and chronic spinal cord injuries after giving 8-OH-DPAT via i.v. 
administration 18. Therefore, the possible action site for initiating non-voiding burst 
activity is located at the spinal cord level, but determining the involved segments of 
the spinal cord requires further experiments. In general, our results show that 8-OH-
DPAT might have an excitatory effect on somatic pathways in the spinal cord and 
may trigger the generator of EUS burst activity early during voiding. 
We examined the pattern of burst activity by observing the SP curve as a 
function of its time course. In control data, the SP curve exhibited a convex-like shape 
during the BP. It asymptotically increased at the beginning of the BP and decreased at 
the end of the BP. Interestingly, this pattern is similar to that indicated by previous 
studies of the urethral flow rate of female rats gradually increasing at the beginning 
and declining at the end of the voiding period 19. Therefore, the duration of the SP 
rather than the AP is an important factor influencing bladder emptying. 
On the other hand, the asymptotical increase at the beginning of the BP 
(approximately 1 s in most rats) is located in phase 1, which is prior to the appearance 
of bladder high-frequency oscillation waves in the IVP. We think this phenomenon 
might be due to the EUS burst activity appearing before bladder neck opening. 
Therefore, it cannot detect any fluid drops around the urethral outlet during this period 
or oscillation waves in the IVP. Hence, the non-voiding burst activity was markedly 
prolonged by up to about 3.6 s after 8-OH-DPAT treatment. The entire tonic EUS-
EMG activity for the entire phase 1 was transformed into burst discharges. However,

(a) Bladder micturition contractions were measured with a constant rate (0.123 
ml/min) of the intravesical saline infusion, which was accompanied by large-
amplitude EUS-EMG activity. The CMG parameters include micturition volume 
threshold (VT), contraction duration (CD), intercontraction interval (ICI), and 
contraction amplitude (CA). (b), (c), (d) and (e) are expansions in the time scale of the 
recording in (a). The brackets indicate the recording periods in (b), (c), (d), and (e) 
respectively at faster time scales. A micturition contraction was divided into the three 
phases of bladder activity in (b). The burst period (BP) in the EUS-EMG can be 
clearly observed in (c), which lasted from the end of phase 1 throughout the entire 
duration of phase 2. The BP in (d) could be divided into non-voiding and voiding 
burst activities, which were located in phases 1 and 2, respectively. The voiding burst 
activity was accompanied by the IVP superimposed with a series of high-frequency 
oscillations (HFOs) but the non-voiding bursts did not cause any oscillation waves in 
the IVP. (e) Individual bursts were composed of active (APs) and silent periods (SPs).

the phase durations before and after 8-OH-DPAT treatment, the duration of non-
voiding burst activity was elongated in phase 1 (compare c with d), and the duration 
of burst activity was elongated in phase 2 (shown in a and b). In phase 3, the rebound 
pressure of the IVP almost completely disappeared (compare e and f). 
Fig. 3: Comparison of the amplitude of bladder high-frequency oscillatory (HFO) 
waves (in phase 2) after vehicle and 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg) treatments. (a) After 
vehicle administration, a HFO wave was in parallel with external urethral sphincter 
electromyographic (EUS-EMG) burst discharges. (b) The amplitude of bladder HFO 
waves was reduced by 8-OH-DPAT treatment. Note that the duration of the silent 
period (SP) was significantly increased while the numbers of burst discharges were 
less than those after vehicle treatment. 
Fig. 4: Comparison of the durations of the active (AP) and silent periods (SP) in the 
time domain after vehicle and 0.3 mg/kg of 8-OH-DPAT treatments. (a) A typical 
example of the burst discharges of external urethral sphincter electromyography 
(EUS-EMG) transformed into the function of the duration of the AP or SP to its 
corresponding time domain. The x-axis values are the middle of the duration of each 
AP or SP, marked with downward arrows. In the rat after vehicle treatment, the AP 
curve exhibited a concave-like shape, while the SP curve showed a convex curve in 
(b). At the end of phase 1, the AP and SP curves asymptotically reached the bottom 
and plateau, and then at the end of phase 2 the curves gradually increased and 
decreased, respectively. (c) After the administration of 8-OH-DPAT, both the AP and 
SP curves were prominently elongated. The AP and SP curves reached the bottom and 
plateau prior to the end of phase 1, and then remained at the bottom and plateau until 
to the end of phase 2, respectively.

INTRODUCTION 
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) increased dramatically during the past 
40 years in the US. It is estimated that 18 million individuals in the US have diabetes, 
among whom, around 80% with non-insulin-dependent DM have cystopathy. 1 
Diabetic cystopathy is characterized by impaired sensations of bladder fullness, an 
increased bladder capacity, decreased bladder contractility, 
and elevated post-void residual urine volumes. 2, 3 Cystopathy was mainly ascribed to 
peripheral polyneuropathy, which affects the autonomic and somatic sensory 
and motor nerves. 3 
Standard therapy, including pharmacologic, behavioral, and surgical approaches, 
was initially used to treat patients. 4 Unfortunately, the cystopathy is often refractory 
to these interventions, which leads most patients to conservatively undertake 
self-catheterization to empty their bladder. 4 However, patients still frequently incur 
urinary tract infections and have a low quality of life. 
Various electrical neuromodulations were developed to treat patients with voiding 
dysfunction who failed to respond to standard treatment. 5, 6 For example, sacral nerve 
root neuromodulation was successfully introduced in spinal cord injured (SCI) 
patients with neurogenic voiding dysfunction. 6, 7 Recently, many studies in animals 
and humans indicated that electrical stimulation of pudendal afferents could engage 
an augmenting reflex and thereby improve bladder emptying in subjects with urine 
retention. 8-10 To the best of our knowledge, few studies have discussed the feasibility 
of electrical neuromodulatory approaches to improve bladder function in diabetic 
patients with cystopathy. The present study investigated the feasibility of activating 
pudendal nerve afferents to improve bladder emptying in a diabetic model with 
voiding dysfunction.

pressure transducer (P23XL-1, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to 
measure the intravesical pressure (IVP). The IVP and EUS EMG were amplified, 
filtered, and sampled at 5 kHz (Biopac MP 36, BIOPAC Systems, Santa Barbara, CA, 
USA). 
The sensory branch of the pudendal nerve was unilaterally exposed via a 
posterior approach by incising the distal portions of the gluteus major muscles. The 
ilium and sacrum were separated, and the sensory branch of the pudendal nerve was 
identified through blunt dissection, carefully isolated, marked with a silk suture, 
and then mounted with a bipolar cuff electrode for electrical stimulation. 
Regulated-current, cathodic, monophasic pulses were applied via a stimulator (Model 
2100, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA). The stimulators were controlled by a 
LabView (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) program that 
sampled and analyzed the bladder pressure signal and generated a voltage signal to 
each of the stimulators via a D/A converter (USB-6212, National Instruments). The 
stimulator was triggered when the cystometric pressure reached a preset threshold. 
Electrical Stimulation of the Sensory Branch of the Pudendal Nerve 
To establish the appropriate range of stimulation currents, the current 
threshold required to evoke the pudendal-pudendal reflex (i.e., an EUS EMG 
evoked by stimulation of the pudendal sensory branch) was measured with stimuli 
applied at 1 Hz in all rats. Subsequently, stimulation of the pudendal sensory nerve 
during continuous-infusion cystometry with an open urethra was performed to 
quantify the effects of pudendal nerve stimulation on bladder emptying. The bladder 
was filled via the superpubic catheter until voiding occurred and continued such that 
each trial included at least three voiding contractions. Unilateral electrical stimulation 
of the sensory branch of the pudendal nerve was applied during voiding 
bladder contractions when the bladder pressure exceeded 40 cmH2O 
7 
 
RESULTS 
General Features 
General physical features of the animals were measured at 8 and 18 weeks after 
induction of diabetes or vehicle (table 1). The mean body weight of rats with diabetes 
for 8 and 18 weeks was around 32% to 41% lower than that of age-matched rats, (P < 
0.001; table 1). The mean bladder weight and blood glucose levels of rats with 
diabetes for 8 and 18 weeks were significantly higher than those of control values. 
Electrophysiological Properties of the Pudendal-EUS Reflex 
The pudendal-EUS reflex was evoked by 1-Hz electrical stimulation of the 
sensory branch of the pudendal nerve in control and diabetic rats, and the 
reflexes consisted of two components at different latencies: a short latency response 
with a larger amplitude and a long latency response with a lower amplitude (fig. 1). 
There was no significant difference in the latencies of the reflex among all groups. 
However, the minimum current threshold required to elicit an EMG response in rats 
with diabetes for 18 weeks was significantly higher than that 
of corresponding control and rats with diabetes for 8 weeks (P < 0.05; table 2). 
Effects of Electrical Stimulation on Cystometry 
Examples of the effects of electrical stimulation on cystometry during the continuous 
transvesical infusion of saline in the diabetic and age-matched control rats are depicted in fig. 
2. In rats with diabetes for 8 and 18 weeks before electrical stimulation (ES), the bladder 
volume threshold for induction of the first bladder contraction and the maximum contraction 
amplitude significantly increased compared to the age-matched controls (figs. 2, 3A, B), 
while the VE was reduced (fig. 3H). The lower VE appeared to significantly increase the 
residual volume and decrease the voided volume and the intercontraction interval in both 
diabetic groups (fig. 3E-G), because at a constant filling rate, the bladder again 
reached the contraction threshold volume in less time. 
9 
 
(P < 0.001). Further, post-hoc paired comparisons (Tukey’s HSD) indicated that 
stimulation intensities ranging 0.05~0.3 mA significantly increased the VE (P < 
0.001).

pathways, a deficiency in the detrusor muscle, or alterations in cholinergic or 
adrenergic receptors in the lower urinary tract. 15, 16 
Previous studies indicated that stimulation of the pudendal nerve in female rats 
exhibited amplitude-dependent effects on bladder activity, 8, 9 and these effects were 
also observed in diabetic male rats. In rats with diabetes for 8 weeks, the duration 
and area of bladder contractions as well as the VE were significantly enhanced by 
smaller current amplitudes (0.025~0.3 mA), whereas these parameters were 
reduced by larger current amplitudes (≥ 0.4 mA) (fig. 3C, D, H). The differential 
effects on bladder activity may have arisen from electrical activation of 
different classes of pudendal afferents according to their diameters. Larger-diameter 
nerve fibers generally have lower thresholds for extracellular stimulation. 17 Pudendal 
afferents comprise a wide range of fiber types, including myelinated Aβ and Aδ fibers, 
unmyelinated c-fibers, and possibly Aα fibers, 18, 19 and myelinated Aα or Aβ fibers 
should have the lowest threshold, while unmyelinated c-fibers have the highest 
stimulation threshold. 20 These results are consistent with bladder excitation resulting 
from activation of the larger myelinated A-type fibers at low stimulation amplitudes 
and inhibition resulting from the inhibitory urethro-bladder reflex mediated by 
urethral c-fibers 21 activated by higher stimulation amplitudes. 
Interestingly, we found that the amplitude-dependent excitation effect shifted to 
higher stimulation intensity ranges in rats with diabetes for 18 weeks compared to that 
in rats with diabetes for 8 weeks (fig. 3H; 0.025~0.3 mA vs. 0.1~0.4 mA). The 
intensity-shifting phenomena might be related to prolonged hyperglycemia in rats with 
diabetes for 18 weeks which activated the polyol pathway, accumulated oxidative 
stress products, and thus caused substantial neuropathy. This speculation was 
supported by our results that the minimal nerve stimulation to evoke EUS responses 
in rats with diabetes for 18 weeks increased compared to the control (table 2), which

function. Although rats are widely used for physiological and pharmacological studies 
of the lower urinary tract, the rat (and dog) exhibits phasic patterns of EUS activity 
during voiding, in contrast to the (complete) relaxation of the sphincter observed in 
humans (and cats). Therefore, it is not clear whether the present results will translate 
to humans, where neural control of EUS activity differs from that in the rat. 
Another limitation is whether electrical stimulation of the pudendal sensory 
nerve can be utilized in all diabetic patients with cystopathy. Some studies 
indicated that diabetic cystopathy is mainly attributed to progressive axonal atrophy 
of the automatic and peripheral nerves,16 and the severity of neuropathy may induce 
diverse symptoms of bladder dysfunction. Typically, most cases of 
diabetic cystopathy manifested voiding dysfunctions. However, in the clinic, 
around 25% of diabetic patients may present bladder storage problems with evidence 
of detrusor overactivity.16 A recent animal study indicated that cystopathy in diabetic 
rats undergoes 2 phases of alterations: 29 exhibition of bladder storage problems in the 
early compensative phase (< 9 weeks) and bladder voiding problems in the late 
decompensative phase (> 12 weeks). Our diabetic animals only exhibiting voiding 
problems may be possible have been due to the animal having a longer induction of 
diabetes. Nevertheless, the feasibility of pudendal nerve stimulation for inhibiting 
diabetic-induced hyper-reflexive bladder activity needs to further explore. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Clinically, conservative treatment often fails in diabetic patients with lower 
urinary tract dysfunction. This study showed the feasibility of improving bladder 
emptying by electrical stimulation of the sensory branch of the pudendal nerve in a 
diabetic animal model. This is an exciting prospect for neuro-rehabilitation as the 
pudendal nerve is readily accessible, 30 and a sufficient branch-free length of nerve is 
available for implantation of a cuff electrode. Amplifying sensory feedback from

轉機，所以去程共花了30多小時才抵達目的地。第一天一大早8:30報到繳交註冊費，大會首先安排了
一個特別演講，由Keynote speaker比利時Dirk De Ridder教授演講，講題為幻覺:疼痛與耳鳴之類比關
係，Ridder教授的演講內容提出與多新觀念，例如如何利用電刺激神經調控，治療聽覺疾病或是本體
感覺障礙，這些神經調控新的應用方向，給我許多研究上啟發。皆下來大會演講分成兩個主軸進行，
包括chronic fatigue syndrome 和Neuraofeedback，演講者都是來自歐洲最頂尖團隊，報告內容相當
精采。當日下午的會議則是有關於大腦皮質訊號應用(Cortical Control of Movement)與神經義肢控制
Neuroprosthetic System)，包括人工視網膜晶片、嗅覺義肢等等，這些研究議題目前國內也有許多團隊
正在進行相關研究，值得借鏡。到了傍晚大會則在飯店外的草皮，舉辦開幕晚會，與會的人數相當多，
在過程中碰到大會主席英國倫敦帝國大學Gruzelier教授，在這一次難得的機會中，我詢問了許多有關
於PET與EEG應用於neurofeedback training等相關研究，Gruzelier教授相當親和向我解說目前研究發
展狀況。
