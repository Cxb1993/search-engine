2. Goal 
When a driver or passenger requires some services on the road, two problems need to be 
considered: (1) how to search the candidate list of service providers? (2) How to select suitable 
service providers from the candidate list? The main objective of the proposed D-TP2P Telematics 
service discovery platform is to manage different kinds of services and provides suitable Telematics 
service information to users. In this project, we proposed the D-TP2P Telematics service platform to 
reduce the server loading, increase the efficiency of service discovery, and provide more suitable 
selections of service providers to users.  
Several challenges concerning this integrated project are as following: 
(1) Telematics Service Markup Language 
In the D-TP2P system, TSML (Telematics Service Markup Language) is proposed to let four 
basic entities, i.e., the tracker server, region servers, service providers and mobile users, be able to 
communicate with each other. The main advantage of using TSML in the D-TP2P system is that the 
development and deployment of any system entity becomes platform/device independent with this 
standardized communication language. 
 
(2) Service Provider Search and Selection Mechanism: 
The service provider search and selection mechanism consists of three parts: (A) spatial queries 
(B) search procedure and (C) selection procedure. In this project, we present the definitions of 
spatial queries, flow charts of the search procedure and the selection procedure that are adopted in 
the D-TP2P system. 
 
(3) D-TP2P messaging protocol:  
Four types of basic entities in D-TP2P are tracker server, region servers, service providers and 
mobile users. In order to provide an integrated platform for communication, a D-TP2P messaging 
protocol is proposed.  How to specify messaging delivery among tracker server, region servers, 
service providers and mobile users is the fundamental and important issue. 
 
(4) bundle layer transmission scheme implementation: 
In this year, the experiment scenario is extend to V2I and mixed mode. According to such 
scenarios, the new function of bundle layer transmission scheme is added. One is RSU search 
function and the other is BP gateway. The RSU search is used to discover which RSU has the 
destination information. The BP gateway is used to convert communication protocols between the

3. 研究方法 
3.1 總計畫 
Preliminary 
 Mobile advertisement 
With the emergence of wireless technologies and Global Positioning System (GPS), a new type 
of location based service is mobile advertisement. Mobile advertisement is used to distribute 
advertisement of service providers to users with mobile devices [5][6]. There are two types of 
mobile advertisement according to the delivery method of advertisement: (1) the push-based 
method and (2) the pull-based method. In the push-based method, service providers push 
advertisements to users. In [7][8][9], the proposed schemes used SMS (Short Messaging Service) 
and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) to push advertisements to users. In [10], Kim et al. 
proposed a mobile advertisement system using the data push scheduling scheme based on user's 
preference. In the pull-based method, users can pull advertisements from service providers with 
some criteria for searching advertisements.  In the D-TP2P framework, our proposed framework 
adopts the pull-based method to pull published information of service providers. 
 
 Location based service 
In [11], geographic information system (GIS) is defined as a system integrating hardware, 
software, and data for capturing, managing, analyzing and displaying all forms of geographically 
referenced information. For example, in [26], Brisaboa et al. developed a geographic information 
system (GIS) using the geographic database. In addition, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) 
plays an important role in the development of GIS standards. OGC is a non-profit, international, 
voluntary consensus standards organization. Some standards are proposed to describe the 
characteristics of GIS information in OGC, e.g., Geography Markup Language (GML) [12], Simple 
Features Interface Standard (SFS) [13].  GML is an XML grammar for expressing geographical 
features, and GML is also an open interchange format for geographic transactions on the Internet. 
SFS provides a pre-defined and common method for applications to store and access geospatial 
feature data in both relational and object-relational databases. In this paper, SFS is adopted to store 
the spatially related data of GIS information. 
Location based service (LBS) makes use of geographical position of the mobile device to 
provide some functions such as parcel tracking, vehicle tracking, advertising, etc. In [25], Ficco et 
al. proposed an open hybrid architecture, which enables the use of several positioning solutions, 
allowing the development of mobile location-aware applications and services. Thus, in the LBS 
10 
 
 
(2) Service query form: When the mobile user wants to send a search query to its current 
region server, the query should be in a service query form. Necessary spatial information is 
encapsulated in it. We will further discuss three types of the D-TP2P system supported spatial 
queries in the "Service Provider Search and Selection Mechanism".  
Figure 2 depicts an example of the TSML document in a service query form. Parameters such 
as "service type", "keyword" and "search scope" are encapsulated in the document. The mobile user 
does not need to understand the format of the service query form. The application in the client side 
is responsible for providing the user interface to generate the search query in a service query form. 
 
Figure 1. An illustrated example of a service description form. 
 
12 
 
 
(4) Location solicitation form: In the location solicitation procedure, the mobile user needs to 
communicate with his current region server. The query and the response are in a location 
solicitation form. Also, the application in the client side is responsible for generating and parsing 
them in the background. Figure 5 and Figure 6 depict examples of TSML documents in a location 
solicitation form.

Figure 4. An illustrated example of a service subscription form (response).

(1) Reference point based query: 
Referring to Figure 7-(a), "reference point" and "search scope" with the circular shape region 
are assigned in this type of queries. For example, let a mobile user send a query to find all service 
providers for tourist guide that are within 2km of a certain tourist attraction. In this case, the 
"tourist attraction" is a "reference point" and the "search scope" is 2 km. 
The reference point based query Q(PR, S) can be formulated as the follows. Let  
(A) A reference query point PR and a search scope S be given in the query. 
(B) An object O represents an element in a set of service providers, List(0) denotes all service 
providers in the region server   
(C) The user-defined search criteria is denoted as UC. 
Then, a spatial query can be written as follows: 
Q(𝑃𝑅 , S) = *Res(O)|O ∈ Region(𝑃𝑅 , S) ∩ (List(O)satisfies 𝑈𝐶)+           (1) 
, where Region(PR,S) means the circular shape region determined by PR and S. Res(O) denotes 
the search results.  
Though the referenced point based query can explicitly determine a search scope, the results 
may be still too large for mobile users. To solve this problem, k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) search 
criterion can be used in a referenced point based query to limit the number of search results. 
 
Figure 7. (a) Referenced point based query, (b) KNN search criterion (k=2) is used in the referenced 
point based query, (c) continual query and (d) route based query.

new query. In this case, the old search results (labeled in square) should be discarded and the new 
results (labeled in triangle) are valid. 
We can further extend E.q. 3 by a time factor t. The requester's position at time t can be 
denoted by PR(t), and Δt is the time interval to send the query message. Thus, valid search results 
in a continual query message can be represented as follows: 
Q(𝑃𝑅(t + ∆t), S) − Q(𝑃𝑅(t), S)       (4) 
(3) Route based query: 
In this case, a predefined route can be determined when a mobile user starts moving. For 
example, a mobile user can send the query to find all service providers who provide parking 
service along his route within 3km. Referring to Figure 7-(d), a route is determined by the mobile 
user at first, and then the proximity of the route is searched. In order to formulate this 
complicated case, we assume that a route is composed of many line segments, and each line 
segment L{(i)(i+1)} in turn can be bounded by two end points Pi and P{(i+1)}. If there are N end 
points, a route is composed of N-1 line segments: 
Route = 𝐿12̅̅ ̅̅ ∪ 𝐿23̅̅ ̅̅ … ∪ 𝐿(𝑁−1)𝑁̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅       (5) 
For a certain line segment L{(i)(i+1)}, a route based query is formalized as follows: 
Q(𝐿(𝑖)(𝑖+1)̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅ ) = {𝑅𝑒𝑠(𝑂)|𝑂 ∈ (⋃ 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑃𝑖, 𝑆) ∩ (𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡(𝑂)𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑓𝑦 𝑈𝐶)
∞
𝑖=1
}     (6) 
Finally, a route based query can be represented in the following form according to Eq. 5 and 
Eq. 6: 
Q(Route) = ⋃ 𝑄(𝐿(𝑘)(𝑘+1)̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅ ̅̅ ̅)
𝑁−1
𝑘=1

scheme, the "event" can trigger the mobile user to send hello messages, and the region server only 
handles the necessary computing to let mobile users have enough information to make decisions by 
themselves. 
In this Section, we design an event-triggered region server decision scheme called Safe-Zone 
Based Scheme (SZBS), which consists of three phases and is depicted in Alogrithm 1, to let a 
mobile user be able to connect to the correct region server. Three phases, which are initialization 
phase, server-side prediction phase, and client-side decision phase, of the SZBS are as follows. 
(i) Initialization phase: when a mobile user starts to drive the vehicle and launch the D-TP2P 
application, the mobile user sends a request to the tracker server to ask which region server is his 
current region server. After receiving the response from the tracker server, the mobile user can 
connect to his initially current region server. 
(ii) Server-side prediction phase: In this phase, in order to let the region server know which 
mobile users are within its region, each mobile user sends a hello message that contains some 
spatial information, e.g., his GPS position, to his current region server. After receiving a hello 
message, the current region server calculates and sends the information of "Safe Zone" and 
"Decision Line" to the corresponding mobile user.  
 
 Region Server Decision Scheme- the Map based Approach 
In recent years, web mapping has become a widely used technology. For users, some products 
based on the web mapping technology are provided, such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, Yahoo Maps, 
etc. Some map related standards are also proposed by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC): (1) Web 
Map Service (WMS), which defines the access methods for map information on the server and (2) 
Geography Markup Language (GML), which describes geographical features. 
For the region server decision concern, the map based approach is another choice that can be 
used to let mobile users be aware of the correct region servers for serving them currently. The idea 
of the map based region server decision scheme is as follows. We create a map data model storing 
20 
 
region server. The new region server needs to take an additional action to check whether it is 
performing a remote and intra-region search for the mobile user or not.  
Step 4: 
 The mobile user can keep moving and waiting for the response from his current region server. 
If the old region server completes the searching, search results will be forwarded to the mobile 
user's current region server, which needs to return the search results back to the mobile user. 
 
3.3 子計畫 2 
This study considers the urban VANET environment that is a two-dimensional Manhattan grid 
model shown in Figure 8. As shown, the streets are lined with buildings, which cause the 
communications to fail when they fall between two vehicles. It is assumed that the 
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication range of 5.9 GHz DSRC is approximately 7.5 m and 
the movement of the vehicles is governed by the Manhattan mobility model. Furthermore, an 
assumption is made that RSUs are located at every intersection and are inter-connected via the 
Internet. Every vehicle or RSU in the network is regarded as a potential traffic source or 
destination. However, while all of the vehicle nodes relay data whenever required, the RSUs do 
not (in order to avoid the hotspot effect). Each vehicle is embedded with a GPS device and can 
therefore obtain its own position and velocity. Furthermore, the position of the destination is 
obtained using a location service implemented at both the vehicles themselves and the RSUs. The 
V2V and V2R communications within the network are handled in accordance with the IEEE 
802.11p standard. The V2V traffic comprises short video clips, audio streams, traffic or news 
information, and so forth. When inter-vehicle communication is not possible due to the distance 
between the vehicles or the presence of obstacles, communications are accomplished using the 
V2I mode rather than the V2V mode.

path, while the segment endpoints serve as agents of the destination in receiving the forwarded 
data.  
 
B. intelligent Adjustment Forwarding 
 The Intelligent Adjustment Forwarding (IAF) algorithm proposed in this study is an 
application layer forwarding algorithm incorporating TCP and VANET routing (e.g., DSR) at its 
lower layers. IAF commences by performing an intelligent routing discovery process to establish 
a transmission path to the destination. (Note that this transmission path may be either a complete 
path to the destination or a partial path to a segment endpoint.) Having performed the intelligent 
route discovery process, the source obtains the position information of all the nodes along the 
transmission path and then determines which of these nodes should be nominated as ICPs 
(intermittently connected point) by examining the quality of their downstream links. The data is 
then transmitted toward the destination by the ICPs using a store-and-forward paradigm. In the 
event that the source node is unable to locate the destination (i.e., because the destination lies at a 
greater number of hops from the source than the value assigned to the TTL parameter), the data is 
transmitted to the segment endpoint, which assumes full control of the data and performs a 
store-carry-and forward function in order to deliver the data to the destination. Thus, in the ad 
hoc mode, IAF provides an efficient and reliable transmission performance even in network 
environments with disabled end-to-end paths.  
 TCP is an end-to-end transfer protocol and is therefore incompatible with IAF, which 
provides a segment-to-segment communication service. Thus, as described in the following, TCP 
must be modified to enable its integration with IAF. The data packet header in IAF has three 
fields containing the sender IP address, the target ICP IP address, and the destination IP address, 
respectively. Initially, IAF adds the IAF header to the data and sends it to the transport layer. 
When the transport layer receives the data and accesses the IAF header, it specifies the target ICP 
IP as the destination IP for the transport protocol (TCP). TCP adds its packet header to the data 
and sends it to the ICP. When the transport layer of the ICP receives the data, it strips the packet 
24 
 
moving direction into the table of passed vehicle which was received as the vehicle entered this 
road segment and broadcast the table to its neighbors. Its neighbors who are locating in the same 
segment would compare the received table with the table itself and update the entries according 
to the timestamps of the entries. Entries whose timestamps are out-of-date would be deleted. If 
the entries in the received table whose timestamps are still valid are not recorded in the table 
itself, it adds these entries into its table of passes vehicles to form a complete table.      
The table of passed vehicle for a road segment is only maintained by the vehicles which 
presently locate in this road segment. Each vehicle periodically broadcasts its table to neighbors 
for updating purpose. The broadcasted messages are only received by the vehicles in the 
corresponding road segment. Other vehicles which are not locating in the road segment would 
ignore the message without relaying it. Therefore, a vehicle which is locating at the intersection 
of road segments would hear about the table belonging to the road segment where it will enter. It 
discards the table belonging to the previous road segment and starts to maintain the new table of 
the road segment it is about to enter.  
For a RREQ message or a data packet, it will be broadcasted until it reaches a road segment 
whose table of passed vehicles contains the information of the target vehicle rather than reaching 
the target vehicle. Once the RREQ message or the data packet is broadcasted into the road 
segment the target vehicle ever passed through, the message can be transmitted along the road 
segments which have the footmark of the target vehicle without being broadcasted into all 
segments. In the proposed footmark leaving scheme, a packet can pursues its target vehicle by 
following the footmark of the target. Eventually, this packet would be received by the target 
vehicle without recalculating the route even the target vehicle is rapidly moving. It significantly 
reduces the control overheads and the broadcast storm problem and greatly improves the 
transmission delays and packet delivery ratio by directly pursuing the target. 
 
26 
 
 
Figure 9. The flow chart of the footmark leaving scheme 
 In the proposed protocol, packets will be transmitted by common vehicles and buses 
simultaneously. A packet carried by a bus can then be forwarded by common vehicles after the 
bus carries it to the appropriate road segment and rebroadcasts it. The predictability and 
regularity of buses can prevent packets from loss until reaching the appropriate conformable road 
segments. Therefore, the proposed protocol can significantly improve the probability of 
successful transmission. Compared to PBR, we allow common vehicles to forward packets 
instead of buses only so that the average transmission delay can be shorter than PBR. The 
transmission delay is dominated by the velocities of buses in PBR because that it only uses buses 
to forward packets. In the environments where the density of buses is low, PBR would not be 
efficient in terms of transmission delay and packet delivery ratio. The flow chart of the proposed 
bus-assisted transmission protocol is summarized as Figure 10.

vehicles in vehicular network. Therefore, designing such a scheme to manage the CCH 
bandwidth on SCHs during SCHI is not easy. 
This section formally illustrates the proposed contention-free bandwidth reservation protocol, 
called Group Reservation MAC (GRMAC). GRMAC transfers the CCH bandwidth scheduling 
procedure from CCH to SCHs, meaning that the vehicles negotiate and reserve the CCH 
bandwidth on SCHs during SCHI. Negotiating the CCH bandwidth requirement on SCHs not 
only alleviates the collisions on CCH, but also lightens the burden of the CCH to perform the 
CCH bandwidth scheduling process. The GRMAC CCH bandwidth reservation process also 
separates and regulates the WSM and WSA traffic in order to eliminate the interference between 
the two traffics. The following subsections illustrate the GRMAC overview, the GRMAC 
structure and definition, the CCH bandwidth reservation procedure on SCHs during SCHI, and 
the WSM/WSA transmission on CCH during CCHI. Finally, an example to demonstrate GRMAC 
is given. 
 GRMAC overview 
Figure 11 shows the architecture of GRMAC. The essence of GRMAC is that dividing vehicles 
into reservation groups (RGs). A RG is a set of vehicles which locate on the same SCH in the 
same SCHI and require CCH bandwidth for data transmission. Each RG sequentially transmits 
data on CCH during CCHI. This grouping strategy therefore overcomes the issue that vehicles 
cannot negotiate the CCH transmission opportunities with other vehicles located on different 
SCHs. On the other hand, in order to reserve the CCH bandwidth and inform other vehicles the 
bandwidth requirement, the vehicles need to attach a piggyback onto the service data which is 
expected to disseminate on SCH. Then, the CCH transmission sequence of the vehicles within the 
same group is decided by the sequence of these vehicles disseminates their service data with the 
piggyback. The vehicles do not need to perform another bandwidth contention procedure on 
SCHs for scheduling the CCH data transmission, thus increasing the performance on SCH.

 Bandwidth Reservation Notification 
 The bandwidth reservation notification (BRN) is applied for the vehicle to notify other 
vehicles its demands of transmitting WSM/WSA data on CCH in the next CCHI. The BRN 
structure contains two one-bit fields which are the WSM and WSA fields, as shown in Figure 12. 
Each of the two fields is applied to indicate the need for making a reservation. That is, the WSM 
Field set to 1 means the vehicle the CCH bandwidth will be reserved for its WSM message, and 
WSA Field set to 1 indicates that the vehicle CCH bandwidth will be reserved for its WSA traffic. 
This vehicle then piggybacks the BRN on the service data packet which supposes to be 
disseminated on SCH during SCHI. The CCH bandwidth will be reserved when other vehicles 
receive this BRN-piggybacked service data.  
32 
 
 Group Reservation Interval and Contention Interval 
GRMAC divides the CCHI into group reservation interval (GRI) and contention interval (CI) 
for the reserved CCH bandwidth and the new incomers’ WSM/WSA traffics, respectively, as 
shown in Figure 13. Thus, the new incomers, who do not reserve CCH bandwidth on SCH in 
previous SCHI, can still obtain the transmission opportunities during CI via conventional IEEE 
802.11p/1609 CSMA scheme.

Figure 13. GRI & CI 
With regard to the GRI, GRMAC divides the GRI into wsmGRI  and wsaGRI  for WSM and 
WSA traffics, respectively. All vehicles transmit data sequentially in both WSM and WSA GRIs. 
Moreover, both WSM and WSA GRIs own an upper bound (i.e., 
max
wsmGRI  and 
max
wsaGRI ) to 
prevent one of the two traffics from maliciously or unintentionally occupying the overall CCH 
bandwidth resource. This can regulate the bandwidth ratio of the WSM and WSA traffic, and it 
can also prevent the WSA traffic from encountering high delay becoming overdue.   
 
 Figure 14 shows that two new time intervals, Member Time Interval (MTI) and Group Time 
Interval (GTI), which are defined to separate the traffics between vehicles within the same RG 
and between RGs, respectively. Detecting a MTI means a vehicle

In order to let mobile users be able to discover Telematics services, an application in the client 
side is implemented based on Microsoft .NET Framework using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. 
 
Figure 20. The service provider can log in his local region server through the web-based interface. 
 
 Figure 21. The web-based interface for service description publishing. 
44 
 
 
Let the user see the accident occurring in front of him, and the injured people need to be taken to 
the hospital. The user can set up parameters of a spatial query to find nearby hospitals. In Figure 24, 
the user sets his current position as a "reference point", the "search scope" is 3 km and the 
parameter "k" for the kNN search is set to 2. The search result is returned and shown in Figure 25. 
The left side of the user interface shows positions of the searched service providers on the Google 
Map; the right side shows description of selected service providers. The user uses the "keyword 
filter" to find the service provider whose service description contains the keyword "ambulance". 
Figure 26 depicts the filtered results, and only "hospital 2" satisfies the user's need. Then the user 
connects to the service provider "hospital 2". In Figure 27, numbers of available ambulances and 
medical staffs that the "hospital 2" can provide are sent to the user, such that he can fill the form and 
send his demand to confirm the service availability. In this case, the user only needs one ambulance 
and two medical staffs to take the injured people to the hospital. Finally, "hospital 2" sends the reply 
to the user. In Figure 28, the reply for the user's requirement "1 ambulance and 2 medical staffs" is 
"YES", and then the user clicks the "Subscribe" bottom to confirm the help. 
 
Figure 23. The application asks the tracker server in order to connect to the current region server.

Figure 26. The filtered search results are shown in the application and the user connects to “hospital 2". 
 
Figure 27. Numbers of ambulances and medical staffs that "hospital 2" can provide are sent to the user such 
that he can send his demand to "hospital 2".

(3) Since it is near lunch time, the user decides to bring some food to his friends to have lunch 
together. Thus, he sends a route based query to find a restaurant near the path to his friends' home 
(referred to Figure 32). However, before the user receives the search result, he leaves his current 
region "Tainan County". In Figure 33, the changed connection information is shown on the user 
interface after using the region server decision mechanism and the region server handoff 
 
Figure 30. The results are shown in the interface when "gas station 1" is found. 
 
Figure 31. "Gas station 2" is found and "gas station 1" becomes invalid because it is not in the user's current 
search scope.

In this experiment, SZBS obviously outperforms TTS. For SZBS, we also find that when the 
vehicle moves along circuitous paths, the messaging overhead is less than the vehicle that moves 
along straight paths. 
 
B. Evaluation of Accuracy 
To evaluate the accuracy of three schemes, we use the "switch time" as performance metrics, 
which is defined as the time interval: 
∆T = 𝑇2 − 𝑇1                                                                                     (8) 
Where T1 is the time that the mobile user actually crosses the boundary of the current region and 
T2 is the time that the mobile user has connected to the correct region server. 
ΔT can be used to denote "the accuracy of the proposed scheme". If the scheme adopted by the 
mobile user has lower ΔT value, it means that this scheme performs better such that the mobile 
user can send or receive his message to or from the correct region server.

mechanism.

Figure 36. scenario 1 
 
In scenario 1, the first connection (i.e., between NB-1 and NB-2) and second connection (i.e., 
between NB-2 and NB-3) will not exist in the same time. In other words, the end-to-end 
connection is never existed. Therefore, source (i.e., NB-1) cannot deliver data to destination (i.e., 
NB-3) directly. Meanwhile, NB-1 is based on BP-transfer scheme to forward data to NB-2 first 
and then NB-2 forwards data to NB-3 when they are hitting each other.

In V2I mode, we assume that NB-1 move away the transmission range of RSU-1 when data is 
sent out from the server after 10 second. NB-1 reaches the transmission range of RSU-2 when it 
has left the transmission range of RSU-1 after 10 second. In BP-transfer scheme, retransmission 
is started from RSU-1 not server as soon as transmission failure is happened during data 
transmission.

because the stable link is more and transmission path is many. The delivery ratio of existing 
VANET approach under sparse network in average vehicle speed 40 km/h is less than 60 km/h 
because mobility can increase capacity in this situation. In summary, the recession of delivery 
ratio with increase data size in existing VANET approaches because it does not only consider to 
find the end-to-end path but also make the strategy of transmission failure.  
Especially, it is much better than others in highly dynamic networks and large data 
transmission especially the bundle size is 15 Mbytes and mare because the situation of 
transmission is in end-to-end transmission is unreliable but segment-to-segment transmission is 
still reliable. The proposed algorithm delivers data from this segment to the other one until 
reaching destination because end-to-end transmission path cannot be maintained. In less dynamic 
environment, the prediction is unnecessary because the most of links are stable. Therefore, IAF 
may miss to predict the link state, it cause larger transmission time and then data delivery will be 
failed. In summary, the simulation result shows that VANET data gets successful delivery can be 
through segment-to-segment transmission.  
Comparing the three schemes, BP has a high delivery ratio in small data size transmission but 
the delivery ratio of existing VANET approach is less. Because transmission time of BP is small 
when transfer data size is small and has a guarantee of data delivery, it has higher delivery ratio. 
The existing VANET approach mainly focus on how to find the best route to prevent link break 
but the available end-to-end path is almost none in VANET environment. The proposed algorithm 
has high performance no matter what size of data transmission because it based on 
segment-to-segment transmission and the size of segment can be adapted according to link state. 
The size of segment path may be short (e.g. two or three hops) if the most of link state are terrible 
or it may be long (e.g. end-to-end path) if the most of link state are excellent. To get the 
successful delivery, the proposed algorithm ensure reliable of each segment transmission path. In 
addition, it will hand over the data to segment endpoint even although the transmission path is 
not found. Therefore, whether the probability of destination discovery or data delivery, it will be 
67 
 
 
Figure 50. Transmission overhead in 50 vehicles and average speed 60 km/h 
 
According to simulation results, we summarize as follows. 1) IAF greatly improves the 
delivery ratio under highly dynamic network but it is worse at low dynamic network. 2) The error 
deployment of ICP will make the data delivery to be failed in IAF. 3) BP must works with some 
efficient routing algorithm and scheduling policy in this vehicular DTN environment. 4) Existing 
VANET approach just want to find an available path but it does not consider after link had been 
broken. 5) The segment-to-segment transmission has better performance than end-to-end 
transmission in VANET environment.

In order to validate our proposed scheme, we adopt The Network Simulation version 2 [7] as 
our simulation tool. Without loss of generality, the real map of Manhattan district, the downtown 
of the New York City, is imported into our simulation experiments. The important parameters are 
listed in the Table 12.  
We investigate the performance of the proposed schemes and compare with CLA-S and PBR 
in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and control overheads. We individually

As shown in Figure 54, the proposed schemes have similar number of control overheads. 
When the average velocity of vehicles is larger than 20m/s, our proposed schemes can have less 
number of control overheads than CLA-S. It is because that CLA-S must recalculate the routes 
when the target vehicles leave the original positions.

required for transmission on CCH during CCHI. Figure 55  (d) further shows the ratio of GRI 
and CI. When WSM arrival rate rises to 120 kbps, GRI Ratio only reaches 85% rather than 100%. 
This is due to that GRMAC tries to prevent the WSA starvation problem by limiting the WSM 
traffics of all RGs upto 80% CCH bandwidth while the GRIwsm upper bound is 80% of CCHI. 
The WSA traffics are thus transmitted with 5% CCH bandwidth consumed. On the other hand, 
the unsatisfied WSM traffic requirement also can compete the transmission opportunity in CI 
which owns the remaining 15% CCH bandwidth. 
Figure 55  (b) shows that the improvement ratios on DMMAC, VMESH and GRMAC. Under 
the heavy load of 100kbps, GRMAC achieve 2 times the system goodput achieved by IEEE 
802.11p/1609. 
  
77 
 
 Number of Vehicles 
The effects of the number of vehicles on the system goodput are investigated in this section. 
The number of vehicles varies from 1 to 100 with the same overall WSM arrival rates, 2.1 Mbps.  
Figure 56 (a) shows that the system goodput of GRMAC reaches about 2.5Mbps and the 
goodput of IEEE 802.11p/1609 reaches about 2Mbps when there is one vehicle in this network. 
The poor performance of the IEEE 802.11p/1609 scheme is due to its back-off time for 
competing transmission opportunity. The system goodput of VMESH is about 1Mbps due to that 
its WSM traffic can only use the fixed divided CCH bandwidth which is one half of CCHI. On 
the other hand, the system goodput of DMMAC is only about 35kbps. This is because that one 
vehicle adopting DMMAC can only select one slot for data transmission in one CCHI since 
DMMAC is based on RR-Aloha. 
The system goodput and the improvement ratio of GRMAC decreases slightly when the 
number of vehicles increases, as shown in Figure 56 (a)~(b). This is because some WSM traffic 
of each vehicle is generated after the reserved CCH bandwidth, and the new generated traffics are 
suffered collision when they competes the transmission opportunities during CI. Figure 56 (c)~(d) 
show that the more vehicles reserved the CCH bandwidth with the same overall WSM arrival rate, 
the less WSM arrival rate, less reserved bandwidth each vehicle owns, and the more new 
generated WSM traffic cannot use the reserved bandwidth. This leads that more traffic have to 
compete the CCH bandwidth, and thus each vehicle suffers more collisions and decreased 
goodput during CI. 
With regards to the IEEE 802.11p/1609 and VMESH, the system goodputs of these two 
methods drop dramatically when the number of vehicles increases, as shown in Figure 56 (a). 
This is due to that they both adopt contention based CSMA scheme for WSM data transmission. 
On the other hand, the system goodput of DMMAC rises, when the number of vehicles increases 
until 50, as shown in Figure 56 (a). The reason is that DMMAC limits one vehicle to use only 
one slot in one CCHI. Therefore, more vehicles exists in the network, more slots can be used for

4.6與各子計畫間的整合 
 
The integrated project will integrate the key theories and techniques developed by each 
sub-project and then provide Telematics service discovery platform for users. In first year, main 
project and each sub-project focuses on their basic work for the integrated project and discusses 
the integrated requirement for main project and each sub-project. 
In the first project, we also perform the system integration with the main project, sub-projects 
by ourselves. The integrated technical items are as follows 
 
 Integration with the first-year sub-project1’s results: 
In first year, the proposed Telematics discovery mechanisms in sub-project 1 are integrated 
with main project. In sub-project 1, they proposed C-VP2P using somecast protocol which can 
provide selection mechanism for finding the suitable service providers in the main project.  
   
 Integration with the sub-project 2’s results:  
In first year, the proposed bundle layer protocol in sub-project 2 is integrated with main project. 
In sub-project 2, the proposed transmission mechanism over bundle layer can make data 
transmission more reliable when the data for service discovery transmits in the main project.    
 
 Integration with the sub-project 4’s results: 
In first year, the proposed bandwidth estimation and allocation mechanisms in sub-project 4 
are integrated with main project. In sub-project 4, the proposed mechanisms can provide better 
network quality to transmit data for users in bus or train when users want to search service 
providers.
