1 Introduction
Evolution of a nanojet has received considerable attentions due to its unique charac-
teristics and wide range of applications, e.g. ink-jet printing, fuel injection, bioengi-
neering, etc. Previous theories and modeling techniques about jet injection have
been developed focused on much larger thermodynamic systems with continuum
assumptions. However, direct application of these theories to nano-scale systems is
uncertain. Conventional liquid jet breakup and spray models require many assump-
tions and experimental correlations that are difficult to obtain in nanojet. Nanojet
devices use an actuator to eject atoms or molecules through a nano-atomizer. How-
ever, the fabrication of the actuator and nano-atomizer is very complex. In addi-
tion, there exist major challenges for the nano-locating and nano-driving systems
and assembly of these components. Therefore, to build a nanojet actually is still
a complex task. On the other hand, molecular dynamics (MD) can offer novel in-
sights into the underlying atomistic mechanisms and nanometer-scale behavior due
to their high temporal and spatial resolution.
Recently, MD has become a popular numerical tool for understanding nanosized
phenomena. MD is a simplified approach. The fast electron motions are excluded
by the contribution of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation (1927) and the motion
of molecules can be simplified as the motions of nuclei. The only input for MD is an
interatomic or intermolecular potential. Owing to numerical simplicity, the effec-
tive pair potential which neglects higher-body terms is commonly used. However,
in spite of these simplified approaches, MD could be an excellent tool for a wide

theoretical/experimental data available in literature. They 
found that the effect of the inlayer vdW atomistic 
interactions can not be neglected and should receive 
attention in the MD simulations of the mechanical 
properties of CNTs. Tang and Advani（2007）performed 
non-equilibrium MD simulations to investigate water 
flow around a single-walled carbon nanotube. It was 
shown that classical continuum mechanics does not hold 
when the drag forces on the nanotube are considered. 
Matsumoto, Nakagaki, Nakatani and Kitagawa（2005）
studied the internal structure-changes around the crack tip 
and the pertinent crack growth behavior in an amorphous 
metal by MD simulation. The Finnis-Sinclair potential for 
α-iron was used to describe the interatomic potential. 
Computed results show that nanoscale crystalline phase 
grows around the crack tip and that the distribution of 
deformation zones and deformation mechanism are 
significantly altered. Wei, Srivastava and Cho（2002）
investigated the temperature dependence of the plastic 
collapse of single-wall carbon nanotubes under axial 
compression by classical MD simulations using 
Tersoff-Brenner potential for C-C interactions. The 
thermal fluctuations are shown to drive nanotubes to 
overcome the energy barriers leading to plastically 
collapsed structures which have significantly lower strain 
energy than fins-like structure. 
In Fig.1, the fluid/air interface for atomizer flow by 
macroscopic analysis from one of the author’s previous 
studies [Yeh（2005）] is shown. It can be seen that the 
liquid evolves into threads in motion after leaving the 
atomizer. In the author’s another previous study [Yeh 
（accepted for publication in International Journal of 
Heat and Mass Transfer）], the vaporization process of a 
nano-scale liquid thread in vapor or vacuum was analyzed 
by MD. The formation of liquid threads, like nanojet, is 
one of the most fundamental and important phenomena 
during the atomization process. The analysis focused not 
only on the liquid particle formation but also on its 
subsequent evolution, which involves breakup, collision, 
and coalescence of the liquid particles. These phenomena 
play important roles in the entire vaporization process. 
From the study, it is also found that Rayleigh’s stability 
criterion [Rayleigh（1879）] holds down to the molecular 
scale. Similar results have also been reported by Koplik 
and Banavar (1993), as well as Kawano (1998). However, 
the above simulation models were limited to an initially 
quiescent liquid thread, which is not emanating but 
intrinsically rearranges itself into droplets or smaller 
liquid threads. In addition, the MD simulation results of a 
time-dependent liquid flow are sensitive to initial 
velocities. Therefore, the above results can not be 
generalized to nanojets. 
Moseler and Landman（2000）reported MD simulation 
results for the formation and instability of liquid nanojet. 
They pointed out that the details of nanojet breakup 
behavior obtained by MD are significantly different from 
the Navier-Stokes result. Shin, Oschwald, Micci and 
Yoon（2005）simulated argon nanojet injection under 
vacuum conditions by MD. They found that different 
injector shapes does not cause significant change in the 
nanojet breakup behavior. On the other hand, the liquid 
temperature inside the injector was found to be a 
controlling factor for the subsequent breakup 
characteristics. A higher liquid temperature is preferred 
for a faster nanojet breakup with a shorter breakup length. 
Choi, Kim and Kim（2006）investigated the capillary 
instability of nanometer-sized surface-tension-driven flow 
by MD with Lennard-Jones fluid. They found that the 
thermal fluctuation, which is significant in a nano-scale 
system, is the most important factor for various breakup 
scenarios of a nanojet.

In this study, liquid argon nanojets made of 44000 
Lennard-Jones molecules are investigated under various 
simulation parameters to examine their influence on the 
nanojet atomization process. Snapshots of the molecules, 
evolution of the density field, and evolution of the 
intermolecular force are analyzed. This can provide 
insight into the fundamental mechanism of the 
atomization process and will be helpful for the design of 
nanojet devices such as nano-printer or nano-sprayer 
 
2. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Method 
 
In this study, the atomization process of a liquid argon 
nanojet discharged into vacuum is investigated by MD 
simulation. The inter-atomic potential is one of the most 
important parts of MD simulation. Many possible 
potential models exist, such as hard sphere, soft sphere, 
square well, etc [Haile（1992）]. In this research, the 
Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential model, which is widely 
used, is adopted for calculation. It is

itself into droplets or smaller liquid threads. In addition, the MD simulation results
of a time-dependent liquid flow are sensitive to initial velocities. Therefore, the
above results can not be generalized to nanojets.
Moseler and Landman (2000) reporte MD simulation results f r the formation and
instability of liquid nanojet. They pointed out that the details of anojet breakup
behavior obtained by MD are significantly different from the Navier-Stokes result.
Shin, Oschwald, Micci and Yoon (2005) simulated argon nanojet injection under
vacuum conditions by MD. They found that different injector shapes does not cause
significant change in the nanojet breakup behavior. On the other hand, the liquid
temperature inside the injector was found to be a controlling factor for the subse-
quent breakup characteristics. A higher liquid temperature is preferred for a faster
nanojet breakup with a shorter breakup length. Choi, Kim and Kim (2006) inves-
tigated the capillary instability of nanometer-sized surface-tension-driven flow by
MD with Lennard-Jones fluid. They found that the thermal fluctuation, which is
significant in a ano-scale ystem, is he most important factor for various breakup
scenarios of a nanojet.
In this study, liquid argon nanojets made of 44000 Lennard-Jones molecules are
investigated under various simulation parameters to examine their influence on the

respectively. The Lennard-Jones fluid in this research is 
taken to be argon for its ease of physical understanding. 
The parameters for argon are as follows [Kawano 
(1998)] : the length parameter σ=0.354 nm, the energy 
parameter ε/kB=93.3K, and the molecular weight 
m=6.64×10-26 kg, where kB=1.38×10-23 J/K denotes the 
Boltzmann constant. The cut-off radius rc beyond which 
the intermolecular interaction is neglected is 5.0σ.

   The nano-atomizer is schematically shown in Fig.2. 
The simulation domain comprises a cubical box of side 
length 3600, with periodic boundary conditions applied in 
all three directions. The nano-atomizer is placed at the 
center of the box. Simulation parameters are listed in 
Table 1, which include nano-atomizer dimensions, 
temperatures, number of molecules and simulation results. 
The time integration of motion is performed by Gear’s 
fifth predictor-corrector method [Haile（1992）] with a 
time step of △t*=0.0001（i.e. 0.25 fs）. The initial number 
density of the liquid argon within the nano-atomizer is 
ρL*=0.819. Note that all quantities with an asterisk in this 
paper, such as L*, D*, ρ*, △t*, T*, etc., are 
non-dimensionalized in terms of σ, ε, and m, i.e. L*=L/σ, 
D*=D/σ, ρ*=Nσ3/V, △t*=△t (ε/m)1/2/σ, T*= kBT/ε. 
The argon molecules inside the nano-atomizer are 
liquid and the nano-atomizer is made of rigid argon 
molecules. A push panel composed of 600 argon 
molecules is constructed with a downward velocity of 
120m/s. In this study, the interactions among liquid argon 
molecules, nano-atomizer and push panel are taken into 
account. 
The procedure for MD simulation includes three 
stages : initialization, equilibration and production. 
Initially, equilibration is performed for liquid molecules 
in a rectangular parallelepiped with length and width 
equal to the initial diameter of the liquid argon molecules 
(2L3*+D*) and with height equal to the initial length of the 
liquid argon molecules (L5*). The initial velocities of 
molecules are decided by the use of normal random 
numbers. Velocity rescaling is performed at each time 
step by Eq.(2) to make sure that the molecules are at the 
desired temperature T* :

where vinew and viold are the velocities of molecule i after 
and before correction, respectively; and TD and TA are the 
desired and the actual molecular temperatures, 
respectively. The liquid molecules are equilibrated for 106 
time steps at the desired temperature T*. The achievement 
of the equilibrium state is confirmed by obtaining the 
radial distribution function. After equilibrium is achieved, 
the rectangular parallelepiped for the liquid molecules is 
truncated to the desired cylindrical liquid molecules by 
removing unwanted regions. Then the cylindrical liquid 
molecules, the nano-atomizer molecules, and the push 
panel molecules are put together into the computational 
domain and the production stage proceeds thereafter. A 
minimum image method and the Verlet neighbor list 
scheme [Haile（1992）] to keep track of which molecules 
are actually interacting at a given time interval of 0.005 
are used in the equilibration and production stages. 
 
3. Results and Discussions 
 
In the following discussion, a liquid argon nanojet of 
length L5* and diameter 2L3*+D* is pushed by a panel into 
vacuum through a nano-nozzle of orifice diameter D*, as 
illustrated in Fig.2. Simulation conditions are listed in 
Table 1.  
 
3.1 Nanojet Atomization Process 
 
Figure 3 shows the atomization process for a nanojet 
of L2*=L3*=L4*=5.73, L5*=76.7, D*/2=8.81 and T*=0.75, 
which corresponds to a nanojet of length 26.2 nm and 
diameter 10 nm, and a nano-nozzle of orifice length 2nm, 
diameter 6 nm, as well as an actual temperature of 70 K. 
The dot in Fig.3 indicates the center of the molecule. 
From the figure it is found that the nanojet does not break

The nano-atomizer is schematically shown in Fig.2. The simulation domain com-
prises a cubical box of side length 3600, with periodic boundary conditions applied
in all three directions. The nano-atomizer is placed at the center of the box. Sim-
ulation parameters are listed in Table 1, which include nano-atomizer dimensions,
temperatures, number of molecules and simulation results. The time integration of
motion is performed by Gear’s fifth predictor-corrector method [Haile (1992)] with
a time step of t∗=0.0001 (i.e. 0.25 fs). The initial number density of the liquid argon
within the nano-atomizer is ρ∗L=0. 19. Note that all quantities with an asterisk in
this paper, such as L∗, D∗, ρ∗, t∗, T ∗, etc., are non-dimensionalized in terms of σ ,
ε , and m, i.e., L∗ = L/σ , D∗ =D/σ , ρ∗ = Nσ3/V, t∗ = t(ε/m)1/2/σ , T ∗ = kBT/ε .
The argon molecules inside the nano-atomizer are liquid and the nano-atomizer is
made of rigid argon molecules. A push panel composed of 600 argon molecules
is constructed with a downwar velocity of 120m/s. In this study, the interactions
among liquid argo molecules, nan -atomizer and push panel are taken into ac-
count.
The procedure for MD simulation includes three stages : initialization, equilibra-
tion and production. Initially, equilibration is perfor ed for liquid molecules in a
rectangular parallelepiped with length and width equal to the initial diameter of the
liquid argon molecules (2L∗3 +D
∗) and with height equal to the initial length of the
liquid argon molecules (L∗5). The initial velocities of molecules are decided by the
use of normal random numbers. Velocity rescaling is performed at each ti e step

angle is larger than at T ∗=2.0. The spurted molecules from the nano-atomizer are
more evenly distributed at this temperature. If the temperature is further increased
to T ∗=4.5 (420 K), as shown in Fig.7, the spray angle is even larger than at T ∗=3.0
and the spurted molecules from the nano-atomizer are much more uniformly dis-
tributed as compared to the lower temperature cases. Comparison of Figs.3, 4, 5,
6 and 7 reveals that the liquid nanojet evaporates quicker at higher temperatures.
This will be further illustrated in later sections discussing the density distribution
and the intermolecular force.

the nano-atomizer in this research is basically a plain-orifice atomizer. As pointed
out by Lefebvre (1989), in a practical plain-orifice atomizer, resistance increases
with nozzle orifice length/diameter ratio. Therefore, a nanojet from a nozzle with
a smaller orifice length/diameter ratio moves farther due to its smaller resistance.
This will be further illustrated in later sections discussing the density distribution
and the intermolecular force.

the local properties can be taken. However, owing to the computational capacity

3.2 Density Distribution 
 
It is important that the system be in equilibrium state 
before statistical values of the local properties can be 
taken. However, owing to the computational capacity 
limitations, the MD simulation can not proceed to a 
macroscopically long period. Nevertheless, the purpose of 
this paper is not to discuss statistical values of the local 
properties but to investigate the atomization process of a 
nanojet, which is important and conducive to the 
understanding of the fundamental mechanism of the 
atomization process. Criteria have to be made to quantify 
the discussion regarding the nanojet atomization process. 
Unfortunately, such criteria are still arbitrary in the 
literature. Because the system temperature in this study is 
kept at the desired temperature, a constant temperature 
criterion is not suitable for the discussion of the 
atomization process. In this research, a nanojet is 
considered to vaporize faster if the distribution of 
molecules reaches a uniform state quicker during the 
atomization process. This criterion essentially concerns 
with the evolution of the density distribution. The density 
at a specified point in the fundamental cell can be defined 
as  
V
N
V δ
δρ δ 0lim→=                                (3)  
where δV is a small volume surrounding the point 
considered and δN is the number of molecules inside the 
volume δV. The density defined by Eq.(3) is actually an 
averaged density of a small volume surrounding the point 
considered. The value will approach the density at a 
specified point if the volume δV shrinks to that point. 
However, for a meaningful density field, the volume δV 
can not be too small because when δV becomes too small, 
it is difficult to obtain a definite value for δN/δV. In this 
study, the volume δV is taken to be a sphere with 
non-dimensionalized radius R*=2 and with its center 
located at the point considered. This is an optimal choice 
after numerical test. 
Figure 10 shows the evolution of density uniformity 
factor for nanojets at different temperatures and the 
conditions of L2*=L3*=L4*=5.73, L5*=76.7, D*/2=8.81 
( cases 1~5 in Table 1 ). The density uniformity factor is

where N is the initial number of liquid molecules in the 
fundamental cell, ρ* and △V are the density and volume 
of molecule i, respectively, as defined by Eq.(3), and ρ*eq 
is the density value when the molecules are uniformly 
distributed, i.e. ρ*eq ≡ N / Vol, where Vol is the volume of 
the fundamental cell. The density uniformity factor fρ as 
defined by Eq.(4) represents the deviation from uniform 
state. From Fig.10 it is observed that a higher temperature 
nanojet evaporates faster than a lower temperature one 
and this corroborates the results of Figs.3~7 as discussed 
in section 3.1. The time averaged value of the density 
uniformity factor, ρf , in a time interval of t*=0 to 80, 
as listed in Table 1, also reveals this observation. In 
Fig.10, it is noted that at lower temperatures（T*=0.75 and 
1.5）, the density uniformity factor increases first and then 
decreases. For a lower temperature nanojet, the momenta 
of the liquid molecules away from the push panel in the 
nano-atomizer are low while the molecules near the push 
panel have relatively higher momenta due to the action of 
the push panel. This results in a compression effect that 
leads to the increase of the density uniformity factor at 
the earlier stage of the atomization process; while at a 
later stage, the density uniformity factor drops because of 
the ejection of the molecules.

Figure 10:  Evolution of the density uniformity factor 
for different temperatures ( cases 1~5 in 
Table 1 ) 
 
  Figure 11 shows the evolution of density uniformity 
factor for different orifice lengths on the basis of identical 
nozzle orifice diameter（6 nm）and the conditions of 
L3*=5.73, L5*=76.7, T*=2.0 ( cases 3, 6 and 7 in Table 1 ). 
It is observed that a nanojet with a shorter orifice length 
evaporates quicker. The time averaged value of the 
density uniformity factor, ρf , in a time interval of t*=0 
to 80, as listed in Table 1, also reveals this observation. 
This corroborates the results of Figs.8(a), (b) and (c) as 
discussed in section 3.1. In addition, it is also observed 
that, as time elapsed, the influence of the orifice length 
mitigates. This is because as time elapsed, more and more 
molecules spurt from the atomizer and hence the 
interaction between the liquid molecules and the rigid 
atomizer molecules mitigates due to the decrease of 
number of molecules inside the atomizer. Figure 12 also 
reveals this tendency. However, as can be observed from 
Fig.12, the influence of the orifice length becomes less 
pronounced at a higher temperature because of the higher 
molecular kinetic energy to overcome the resistance 
caused by the orifice. Figure 13 shows the evolution of

3.3 Intermolecular Force 
 
The intermolecular force is an indication of the 
surface tension experienced by the liquid particles and 
has a great effect upon the atomization process. Lefebvre
（1989）, Chigier（1999）and Hiroyasu（2000） pointed 
out that surface tension and interfacial force are the major 
controlling mechanisms for atomization. Owing to the 
vacuum environment, the aerodynamic effect on the 
atomization process is negligible in this study. Thus, the 
surface tension becomes the major controlling mechanism

is noted that at lower temperatures (T ∗=0.75 and 1.5), the density uniformity factor
increases first and then decreases. For a lower temperature nanojet, the momenta of
the liquid molecules away from the push panel in the nano-atomizer are low while

temperatures and the conditions of L2*=L3*=L4*=5.73,

where N is the total number of molecules in the 
fundamental cell and F*i,t* is the resultant force of the 
non-dimensionalized intermolecular force vector acting 
on molecule i at time t* , i.e. F*i,t* = ( F*x,i,t*2 + F*y,i,t*2 + 
F*z,i,t*2 )1/2 , where  F*x,i,t*,  F*y,i,t*  and  F*z,i,t*  are the 
components of the intermolecular force vector at the x, y 
and z directions, respectively, acting on molecule i at time 
t*. Note that in the above definition of **tF  , N is the 
total number of molecules in the fundamental cell, which 
includes liquid, vapor and solid molecules（atomizer and 
push panel）; while in the definition of density uniformity 
factor, Eq.(4), N is only the initial number of liquid 
molecules in the fundamental cell, i.e. the solid molecules 
are excluded. The intermolecular force diminishes with 
time because of the increase of distances between 
molecules as the nanojet vaporizes. From Fig.15, it is 
observed that a higher temperature nanojet evaporates 
faster than a lower temperature one. This corroborates the 
results of Figs.3~7 discussed in section 3.1 and Fig.10 in 
section 3.2. In Fig.15, it is also noted that although a 
higher temperature nanojet has a larger intermolecular 
force at the earlier stage of the atomization process due to 
its higher momentum, it evaporates faster and therefore 
the intermolecular force decays quicker. Figure 16 shows 
the time averaged value of the averaged 
non-dimensionalized intermolecular force for different 
orifice lengths on the basis of identical nozzle orifice 
diameter（6 nm）and the conditions of L3*=5.73, L5*=76.7, 
T*=2.0 ( cases 3, 6 and 7 in Table 1 ). It is observed that a 
nanojet with a shorter orifice length evaporates quicker. 
This corroborates the results of Figs.8(a), (b) and (c) as 
discussed in section 3.1 and Fig.11 as discussed in section 
3.2. In addition, it is also observed that, as time elapsed, 
the influence of the orifice length mitigates. As explained 
in section 3.2, more and more molecules spurt from the 
atomizer as time elapsed. This causes the interaction 
between the liquid molecules and the rigid atomizer 
molecules to mitigate due to the decrease of number of 
molecules inside the atomizer. Figure 17 also reveals this 
tendency. However, as can be observed from Fig.17, the 
influence of the orifice length becomes less pronounced 
at a higher temperature because of the higher molecular

orifice. Figure 18 shows the evolution of averaged 
non-dimensionalized intermolecular force for different 
orifice diameters on the basis of identical nozzle orifice 
length（2 nm）and the conditions of L4*=5.73, L5*=76.7, 
T*=2.0 ( cases 3 and 8 in Table 1 ). It is observed that a 
nanojet with a larger orifice diameter evaporates quicker. 
This corroborates the results of Figs.8(a) and (d) as 
discussed in section 3.1 and Fig.13 as discussed in section 
3.2 and also reveals that a nanojet from a nozzle with a 
smaller orifice length/diameter ratio evaporates quicker. 
Similar tendency can b  observed from Fig.19 for a 
higher temperature nanojet.

where N is the total number of molecules in the 
fundamental cell and F*i,t* is the resultant force of the 
non-dimensionalized intermolecular force vector acting 
on molecule i at time t* , i.e. F*i,t* = ( F*x,i,t*2 + F*y,i,t*2 + 
F*z,i,t*2 )1/2 , where  F*x,i,t*,  F*y,i,t*  and  F*z,i,t*  are the 
components of the intermolecular force vec or at the x, y 
and z directions, respectively, acting on molecule i at time 
t*. Note that in the above definition of **tF  , N is the 
total number of molecules in the fundamental cell, which 
includes liquid, vapor and solid molecules（atomizer and 
push panel）; while in the definition of density uniformity 
factor, Eq.(4), N is only th  initial number of liquid 
molecules in the fundamental cell, i.e. the solid molecules 
are excluded. The intermolecular force dimi ishes with 
time because of the increase of distances between 
molecules as the nanojet vaporizes. From Fig.15, it is 
observed that a higher temperature nanojet evaporates 
faster than a lower temperature one. This corroborates the 
results of Figs.3~7 discussed in section 3.1 and Fig.10 in 
section 3.2. In Fig.15, it is also noted that although a 
higher temperature nanojet has a larger intermolecular 
force at the earlier stage of the atomization process due to 
its higher momentum, it evaporates faster and therefore 
the intermolecular force decays quicker. Figure 16 shows 
the time averaged value of the averaged 
non-dimensionalized intermolecular force for different 
orifice lengths on the basis of identical nozzle orifice 
diameter（6 nm）and the conditions of L3*=5.73, L5*=76.7, 
T*=2.0 ( cases 3, 6 and 7 in Table 1 ). It is observed that a
nanojet with a shorter orifice length ev porates quicker. 
This corroborates the results of Figs.8(a), (b) and (c) as 
discussed in section 3.1 and Fig.11 as discussed in section 
3.2. In addition, it is also observed that, as time elapsed, 
the influence of the orifice length mitigates. As explained 
in section 3.2, more and more molecules spurt from the 
atomizer as time elapsed. This causes the interaction 
between the liquid molecules and the rigid atomizer 
molecules to mitigate due to the decrease of number of 
molecules inside the atomizer. Figure 17 also reveals this 
tendency. However, as can be observed from Fig.17, the 
influence of the orifice length becomes less pronounced 
at a higher temperature because of the higher molecular 
kinetic energy to overcome the resistance caused by the 
orifice. Figure 18 shows th  evol tion of averaged 
non-dimensionalized intermolecular f rce for different 
orifice diameters on the basis of identical n zzle orifice 
length（2 nm）and the conditions of L4*=5.73, L5*=76.7,

4 Conclusions 
 
   In this study, the atomization process of a nanojet is 
investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. It is 
found that a liquid nanojet evaporates faster at a higher 
temperature. On the basis of identical nozzle orifice 
diameter, a nanojet from a nozzle with a shorter orifice 
length evaporates quicker. However, the influence of the 
orifice length mitigates as time elapsed. In addition, the 
influence of the orifice length becomes less pronounced 
at a higher temperature. On the other hand, on the basis of 
identical nozzle orifice length, a nanojet from a nozzle 
with a larger orifice diameter evaporates quicker. The 
present simulation results reveal that a nozzle with a 
smaller orifice length/diameter ratio produces better 
atomization. This corroborates the results from 
conventional macroscopic analysis.

Summary
In this study, the vaporization process of a nanojet is investigated by molecular dy-
namics simulation. Liquid argon nanojet made of 44000 Lennard-Jones molecules
is investigated under various simulation parameters to examine their inﬂuence on
the nanojet vaporization process. Snapshots of the molecules, evolution of the
density ﬁeld, and evolution of the intermolecular force are analyzed. The present
simulation results can provide insight into the fundamental mechanism of the at-
omization process and will be helpful for the design of nanojet devices such as
nano-printer or nano-sprayer.

Moseler and Landman [6] reportedMD simulation results for the formation and
instability of liquid nanojet. They pointed out that the details of nanojet breakup
behavior obtained by MD are signiﬁcantly different from the Navier-Stokes re-
sult. Shin et al. [7] simulated argon nanojet injection under vacuum conditions by
MD. They found that different injector shapes does not cause signiﬁcant change
in the nanojet breakup behavior. On the other hand, the liquid temperature inside
the injector was found to be a controlling factor for the subsequent breakup char-
acteristics. A higher liquid temperature is preferred for a faster nanojet breakup
with a shorter breakup length. Choi et al. [8] investigated the capillary instability
of nanometer-sized surface-tension-driven ﬂow by MD with Lennard-Jones ﬂuid.
They found that the thermal ﬂuctuation, which is signiﬁcant in a nano-scale system,
is the most important factor for various breakup scenarios of a nanojet.
In this study, liquid argon nanojetsmade of 44000Lennard-Jonesmolecules are
investigated under various simulation parameters to examine their inﬂuence on the
nanojet vaporization process. This will be helpful for the design of nanojet devices
such as nano-printer or nano-sprayer and can provide insight into the fundamental

The argon atoms inside the nano-nozzle are liquid and the nano-nozzle is made
of rigid argon atoms. A push panel composed of 600 argon atoms is constructed
with a downward velocity of 120m/s. In this study, the interactions among liquid
argon atoms, nano-nozzle and push panel are taken into account.
Velocity rescaling is performed at each time step by the following correction to
make sure that the system is at the desired temperature :
vnewi = v

i
√
TD

(2)
where vnewi and voldi are the velocities of molecule i after and before correction,
respectively, and TD and TA are the desired and the actual system temperatures,
respectively. A minimum image method and the Verlet neighbor list scheme [9] to
keep track of which molecules are actually interacting at a given time interval of
0.005 are used.
Results and Discussions
In the following discussion, a liquid argon nanojet of length L∗5 and diameter 2L∗3 +
D∗ is pushed by a panel into vacuum through a nano-nozzle of oriﬁce diameter D∗,
as illustrated in Fig.2. Simulation conditions are listed in Table 1.
Nanojet Vaporization Process
Figure 3 shows the snapshot of a nanojet at t∗ = 80 with the conditions of L∗2 =
L∗3 = L
∗
4 = 5.73, L∗5=76.7, D∗/2=8.81 and T ∗=0.75, which corresponds to a nanojet
of length 26.2 nm and diameter 10 nm, and a nano-nozzle of oriﬁce length 2nm,
diameter 6 nm, as well as an actual temperature of 70 K. The dot in Fig.3 indicates
the center of the molecule. From the ﬁgure it is found that the nanojet does not
break up. Owing to the low temperature, the molecular kinetic energies are so low
that the molecules congregate near the oriﬁce exit. Very few liquid molecules are
evaporated at this low temperature. At a higher temperature T ∗=1.5 (140 K), as
shown in Fig.4, the molecules leave the oriﬁce exit earlier than at T ∗=0.75, due
to their higher molecular kinetic energies. More liquid molecules are evaporated
at this higher temperature. However, like at T ∗=0.75, the nanojet has not broken
up before t∗=80. If the temperature is further increased to T ∗=2.0 (187 K), as
shown in Fig.5, evident evaporation is observed. Many evaporated molecules are
produced and the non-evaporated liquid molecules concentrate within the central
region. Figure 6 shows the snapshots for temperature T ∗=3.0 (278 K). It is observed
that breakup of the nanojet occurs and its spray angle is larger than at T ∗=2.0.
The spurted molecules from the nano-nozzle are more evenly distributed at this
temperature. If the temperature is further increased to T ∗=4.5 (420 K), as shown in

increases ﬁrst and then decreases. For a lower temperature nanojet, the momenta
of the liquid molecules away from the push panel in the nano-nozzle are low while
the molecules near the push panel have relatively larger momenta. This results in
a compression effect and leads to the increase of the density uniformity factor at
the earlier stage of the vaporization process. Figure 10 shows the evolution of den-
sity uniformity factor for different oriﬁce lengths (cases 3, 6 and 7 in Table 1) on
the basis of identical nozzle oriﬁce diameter (6 nm) and the conditions of L∗3=5.73,
L∗5=76.7, T ∗=2.0. It is observed that a nanojet with a shorter oriﬁce length evap-
orates quicker. This corroborates the results of Figs.8(a), (b) and (c) as discussed
in section 3.1 : a nanojet from a nozzle with a smaller oriﬁce length/diameter ra-
tio moves farther due to its smaller frictional loss. Figure 11 shows the evolution
of density uniformity factor for different oriﬁce diameters ( cases 3 and 8 in Ta-
ble 1 ) on the basis of identical nozzle oriﬁce length (2 nm) and the conditions of
L∗4=5.73, L∗5=76.7, T ∗=2.0. It is observed that a nanojet with a larger oriﬁce diam-

of L∗2 = L∗3 = L∗4=5.73, L∗5=76.7, D∗/2=8.81. The averaged non-dimensionalized

where N is the total number of molecules in the fundamental cell and F∗i,t∗ is the
resultant force of the non-dimensionalized intermolecular force vector acting on
molecule i at time t∗ , i.e. F∗i,t∗ = (F∗x,i,t∗ 2 +F∗y,i,t∗ 2 +F∗z,i,t∗ 2)1/2, where F∗x,i,t∗ , F∗y,i,t∗
and F∗z,i,t∗ are the components of the intermolecular force vector at the x, y and z
directions, respectively, acting on molecule i at time t∗. Note that in the above def-

includes liquid, vapor and solid molecules (nozzle and push panel); while in the

molecules in the fundamental cell, while the solid molecules are excluded. The
intermolecular force diminishes with time because of the increase of distances be-
tween molecules as the nanojet vaporizes. From Fig.12, it is observed that a higher
temperature nanojet evaporates faster than a lower temperature one. This corrob-
orates the results of Figs.3∼7 discussed in section 3.1 and Fig.9 in section 3.2. In
Fig.12, it is also noted that although a higher temperature nanojet has a larger inter-
molecular force at the earlier stage of the vaporization process due to its higher mo-
mentum, it evaporates faster and therefore the intermolecular force decays quicker.

Summary
In this study, the vaporization process of a nanojet is investigated by molecular dy-
namics simulation. Liquid argon nanojet made of 44000 Lennard-Jones molecules
is investigated under various simulation parameters to examine their inﬂuence on
the nanojet vaporization process. Snapshots of the molecules, evolution of the
density ﬁeld, and evolution of the intermolecular force are analyzed. The present
simulation results can provide insight into the fundamental mechanism of the at-
omization process and will be helpful for the design of nanojet devices such as
nano-printer or nano-sprayer.

Moseler and Landman [6] reportedMD simulation results for the formation and
instability of liquid nanojet. They pointed out that the details of nanojet breakup
behavior obtained by MD are signiﬁcantly different from the Navier-Stokes re-
sult. Shin et al. [7] simulated argon nanojet injection under vacuum conditions by
MD. They found that different injector shapes does not cause signiﬁcant change
in the nanojet breakup behavior. On the other hand, the liquid temperature inside
the injector was found to be a controlling factor for the subsequent breakup char-
acteristics. A higher liquid temperature is preferred for a faster nanojet breakup
with a shorter breakup length. Choi et al. [8] investigated the capillary instability
of nanometer-sized surface-tension-driven ﬂow by MD with Lennard-Jones ﬂuid.
They found that the thermal ﬂuctuation, which is signiﬁcant in a nano-scale system,
is the most important factor for various breakup scenarios of a nanojet.
In this study, liquid argon nanojetsmade of 44000Lennard-Jonesmolecules are
investigated under various simulation parameters to examine their inﬂuence on the
nanojet vaporization process. This will be helpful for the design of nanojet devices
such as nano-printer or nano-sprayer and can provide insight into the fundamental

The argon atoms inside the nano-nozzle are liquid and the nano-nozzle is made
of rigid argon atoms. A push panel composed of 600 argon atoms is constructed
with a downward velocity of 120m/s. In this study, the interactions among liquid
argon atoms, nano-nozzle and push panel are taken into account.
Velocity rescaling is performed at each time step by the following correction to
make sure that the system is at the desired temperature :
vnewi = v
old
i
√
TD
TA
(2)
where vnewi and voldi are the velocities of molecule i after and before correction,
respectively, and TD and TA are the desired and the actual system temperatures,
respectively. A minimum image method and the Verlet neighbor list scheme [9] to
keep track of which molecules are actually interacting at a given time interval of
0.005 are used.
Results and Discussions
In the following discussion, a liquid argon nanojet of length L∗5 and diameter 2L∗3 +
D∗ is pushed by a panel into vacuum through a nano-nozzle of oriﬁce diameter D∗,
as illustrated in Fig.2. Simulation conditions are listed in Table 1.

Figure 3 shows the snapshot of a nanojet at t∗ = 80 with the conditions of L∗2 =
L∗3 = L
∗
4 = 5.73, L∗5=76.7, D∗/2=8.81 and T ∗=0.75, which corresponds to a nanojet
of length 26.2 nm and diameter 10 nm, and a nano-nozzle of oriﬁce length 2nm,
diameter 6 nm, as well as an actual temperature of 70 K. The dot in Fig.3 indicates
the center of the molecule. From the ﬁgure it is found that the nanojet does not
break up. Owing to the low temperature, the molecular kinetic energies are so low
that the molecules congregate near the oriﬁce exit. Very few liquid molecules are
evaporated at this low temperature. At a higher temperature T ∗=1.5 (140 K), as
shown in Fig.4, the molecules leave the oriﬁce exit earlier than at T ∗=0.75, due
to their higher molecular kinetic energies. More liquid molecules are evaporated
at this higher temperature. However, like at T ∗=0.75, the nanojet has not broken
up before t∗=80. If the temperature is further increased to T ∗=2.0 (187 K), as
shown in Fig.5, evident evaporation is observed. Many evaporated molecules are
produced and the non-evaporated liquid molecules concentrate within the central
region. Figure 6 shows the snapshots for temperature T ∗=3.0 (278 K). It is observed
that breakup of the nanojet occurs and its spray angle is larger than at T ∗=2.0.
The spurted molecules from the nano-nozzle are more evenly distributed at this
temperature. If the temperature is further increased to T ∗=4.5 (420 K), as shown in

increases ﬁrst and then decreases. For a lower temperature nanojet, the momenta
of the liquid molecules away from the push panel in the nano-nozzle are low while
the molecules near the push panel have relatively larger momenta. This results in
a compression effect and leads to the increase of the density uniformity factor at
the earlier stage of the vaporization process. Figure 10 shows the evolution of den-
sity uniformity factor for different oriﬁce lengths (cases 3, 6 and 7 in Table 1) on
the basis of identical nozzle oriﬁce diameter (6 nm) and the conditions of L∗3=5.73,
L∗5=76.7, T ∗=2.0. It is observed that a nanojet with a shorter oriﬁce length evap-
orates quicker. This corroborates the results of Figs.8(a), (b) and (c) as discussed
in section 3.1 : a nanojet from a nozzle with a smaller oriﬁce length/diameter ra-
tio moves farther due to its smaller frictional loss. Figure 11 shows the evolution
of density uniformity factor for different oriﬁce diameters ( cases 3 and 8 in Ta-
ble 1 ) on the basis of identical nozzle oriﬁce length (2 nm) and the conditions of
L∗4=5.73, L∗5=76.7, T ∗=2.0. It is observed that a nanojet with a larger oriﬁce diam-

12 shows the evolution of averaged non-dimensionalized intermolecular force for
nanojets with different temperatures ( cases 1∼5 in Table 1 ) and the conditions
of L∗2 = L∗3 = L∗4=5.73, L∗5=76.7, D∗/2=8.81. The averaged non-dimensionalized
intermolecular force at time t∗ is deﬁned as
F∗t∗ =
N
∑
i=1
F∗i,t∗
N
(5)
where N is the total number of molecules in the fundamental cell and F∗i,t∗ is the
resultant force of the non-dimensionalized intermolecular force vector acting on
molecule i at time t∗ , i.e. F∗i,t∗ = (F∗x,i,t∗ 2 +F∗y,i,t∗ 2 +F∗z,i,t∗ 2)1/2, where F∗x,i,t∗ , F∗y,i,t∗
and F∗z,i,t∗ are the components of the intermolecular force vector at the x, y and z
directions, respectively, acting on molecule i at time t∗. Note that in the above def-
inition of F∗t∗ , N is the total number of molecules in the fundamental cell, which
includes liquid, vapor and solid molecules (nozzle and push panel); while in the
deﬁnition of density uniformity factor, Eq.(4), N is the initial number of liquid
molecules in the fundamental cell, while the solid molecules are excluded. The
intermolecular force diminishes with time because of the increase of distances be-
tween molecules as the nanojet vaporizes. From Fig.12, it is observed that a higher
temperature nanojet evaporates faster than a lower temperature one. This corrob-
orates the results of Figs.3∼7 discussed in section 3.1 and Fig.9 in section 3.2. In
Fig.12, it is also noted that although a higher temperature nanojet has a larger inter-
molecular force at the earlier stage of the vaporization process due to its higher mo-
mentum, it evaporates faster and therefore the intermolecular force decays quicker.
