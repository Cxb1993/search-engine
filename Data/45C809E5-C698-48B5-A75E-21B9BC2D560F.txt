Abstract 
H2 is viewed as one of the promising clean fuels of the future. The H2 economy 
involves three important areas: production, storage, and use. Among them, 
developing effective H2 storage methods and materials for transportation is a key 
challenge for basic research and a crucial factor in achieving the H2 economy.  
LiBH4 is a potential H2 storage material owing to its high theoretical H2 
capacity (18.5 wt% H2). In this study, the as-received LiBH4 is modified by 
Pd-Ni(OH)x additives and their dehydrogenation properties are investigated by 
temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature programmed 
dehydrogenation-mass spectrometers (TPD-MS). The phase structures of the 
modified LiBH4 before and after dehydrogenation are analyzed by the X-ray powder 
diffraction (XRD) method. For the Pd-Ni(OH)x modified LiBH4, it presents superior 
dehydrogenation kinetics, and its Tm (the main dehydrogenation peak) is changed 
from 740 to 370 K, suggesting that the Pd-Ni(OH)x additive can effectively reduce 
 1
developed in low weight complex hydrides such as alanates [AlH4]−, amides [NH2]−, 
imides and borohydrides [BH4]−. For LiBH4, the partial decomposition to LiH (s) + B (s) 
+ 3/2H2 (g) has a standard enthalpy of 67 KJ/mol. The highly exothermic reaction 
indicates that dehydrogenation of LiBH4 must be performed at elevated temperature. 
2. Motivation of this project 
Recently, the green energy becomes very important with petroleum energy 
gradually reduction. Therefore, H2 has been increasingly developed and considered 
as a new and clean resource for future automotive or fuel cells applications. 
Furthermore, the US Department of Energy (DOE) published a periodical of 
H2-storage development in the future. The minimum H2-storage capacity should be 
6.5 wt% and 65 g/L H2 available, at the H2 desorption temperature between 60 and 
120 ◦C (333 and 393 K) for commercial viability, and the low temperature for H2 
desorption and low pressure for H2 absorption of a little bars at room temperature. 
Therefore, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) becomes a potential candidate for H2 
storage materials because of its high gravimetric and volumetric H2 densities: 18.5 
wt% H2 and 121 kg H2/m3, respectively [1]. In this project, LiBH4 is used as H2 
storage materials and their H2 storage capacities and properties have been modified 
by the addition of Pd-Ni(OH)x catalysts. 
In the first part, the various additives of the modified-LiBH4 system are 
investigated. In the second part, Pd-Ni(OH)x catalysts have been modified the LiBH4 
to promote the their dehydrogenation and various modification ratios have been also 
compared. Since the dehydrogenation thermodynamics and the kinetics of those 
samples may be influenced by the existence of [OH]- groups, in the third part, the 
destabilization effect of [OH]- on the dehydrogenation of the modified-LiBH4 is 
elucidated. A new system for destabilization of the LiBH4 and meaningful decrease 
in its dehydrogenation temperature near room temperature is highly expected in this 
study. 
3.  Literature review 
 LiBH4 is one of the potential candidates for H2 storage materials because its 
gravimetric and volumetric H2 densities are 18.5 wt% H2 and 121 kg H2/m3, 
respectively [2]. Recently, Züttel et al. [3] have investigated the characteristics of H2 
desorption for LiBH4. The dehydrogenation reaction of LiBH4 is shown as equation 
(1): 
  4 23 / 2                (1) → + +LiBH LiH B H
They have proved that the value of enthalpy for the reaction (1) is equal to 67 
KJ/mol.  This high enthalpy change determines the high desorption temperature of 
 3
and 0.25). For the heat-treated catalysts, they were mixed with LiBH4 and then 
mechanically milled. The as-milled mixture of LiBH4 and heated Pd-Ni(OH)x 
nanoparticles with mass ratios (2:1) were named as C0.5-H. 
 The identification of phase structures of various samples before and after 
dehydrogenation or heat treatment was carried out by the X-ray powder diffraction 
(XRD) method with Cu Kα radiation. A Johansson-type Ge monochromator 
produces a focused high-intensity monochromatic CuKα1 primary beam (λ = 1.54 Å) 
at 40 kV and 20 mA. The scanning speed was 1.3 °/min and present time was 10 sec.  
 The dehydrogenation kinetic behavior of fresh LiBH4 samples, as-prepared 
catalysts, and modified LiBH4 was characterized by temperature-programmed 
reduction (TPR). In the TPR system, temperature profiles and the H2 consumption or 
desorption were measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Sample of 200 
mg were inserted into a quartz tube reactor (4-m.m.diameter), which was located at 
an electric furnace. A H2/N2 (25 % H2) gas mixture was allowed to flow at a flow 
rate of 50 ml/min while raising the temperature from 300 to 770 K at a heating rate 
of 3 K/min. TPD-MS apparatus is equipped with the temperature programmed 
system and a mass spectrometer (Agilent 5975 Series MSD). For each experiment, a 
specimen of approximately 100 mg of sample was loaded into a quartz tube (4-m.m. 
diameter) between quartz wool plugs. The septa-sealed specimen tube was placed in 
the furnace and a continuous flow of He gas (flow rate of 40 sccm) was passed 
through the specimen, while it was heated at a programmed rate of 10 K/min from 
room temperature to 873 K. Concentrations of H2 (m/e = 2) in the effluent were 
determined by comparison to single-point calibrations obtained by using a certified 
of H2 (flow rate of 40 sccm) and all dehydrogenation comparison plots were 
normalized against to the weight of LiBH4. 
5. Results and discussion 
5.1 The dehydrogenation properties of modified LiBH4  
The dehydrogenation properties of the as-received LiBH4 and LiBH4 modified 
via different additives are measured by TPR at the heating rate of 3 K/min. Figure 1 
shows their TPR profiles. The as-received LiBH4 profile exhibits three distinct 
desorption peaks located at the range of 330~380, 550~620, and 700~780 K, 
respectively. In the first stage, a polymorphic transformation takes place at around 
350 K and a small decomposition occurs. The decomposition in the second stage 
starts at near its melting point (553 K in 1 bar). The meaningful decomposition in 
the third stage appears at around 740 K where an intense reaction occurs. It is 
obviously observed that the main desorption peak (Tm) is located at 740 K. The 
addition of Pd or Ni(OH)2 additives can accelerate the decomposition rate of LiBH4

Figure 2 The H2 released capacities of various LiBH4 measured by TPD-MS. 
 
the capacities are about 8.5, 6.5, 3.5 and 1.5 wt%, respectively. Although, the C0.25 
desorbs more H2 than C0.5, its onset temperature is also much higher than C0.5 
about 150 K. It should be mentioned clearly that the above values contain no other 
gas except H2 gas. 
In order to identify the H2 desorption mechanism of the LiBH4/Pd-Ni(OH)x 
mixture with various ratios, the XRD measurements for the mixtures before and 
after dehydrogenation are conducted. In Figure 3, peaks of Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 
14-0117), Ni (JCPDS 04-0580), Pd (JCPDS 46-1043), and LiBH4 (JCPDS 27-0287) 
are observed in the C0.5 sample. After dehydrogenation, those phases transfer to Ni, 
PdB2 (JCPDS 39-0435), and Li6B4O9 (JCPDS 12-0129). The dehydrogenation 
reaction for this sample is: 
 4 6 4 9 2 26 ( ) 12         (2)      + + → + + +xLiBH Pd Ni OH Li B O PdB Ni H
5.2 The [OH]- effect on the dehydrogenation of modified LiBH4  
In order to identify the importance of [OH]- for the dehydrogenation, 
Pd-Ni(OH)x is heated at 473 K for 1 h. The reaction equation for this treatment is: 
  PdN 2( )                  (3)                                             → + +xi OH Pd NiO H O
 The dehydrogenation properties measured by TPD-MS of C0.5 and C0.5-H are 
compared in Figure 4. The profiles of C0.5 sample exhibits the main dehydrogenation 
peak starting from 330 K and Tm is at 370 K while for C0.5-H, the Tm is 560 K,  
 7
implying the C0.5-H sample does not display meaningful promotion in the 
dehydrogenation kinetics. Consequently, it can be suggested that the desorption of 
[OH]- during heat treatment leads to the limited enhancement in dehydrogenation of 
the LiBH4. Figure 5 displays the dehydrogenation capacities of [OH]- group effect 
on the C0.5 and C0.5-H samples. The H2 capacities are calculated by the integral 
values of the TPD-MS profiles. The H2 released from 298 to 700 K for the C0.5-H 
and C0.5 are about 6.7 and 7.0 wt%, respectively, indicating that the heat treatment 
does not change the desorption capacity of the mixture. However, the Tm for C0.5 
and C0.5-H is about 350 and 550 K, respectively, suggesting that the [OH]- group 
does not influence the H2 capacities, but strongly affect the dehydrogenation kinetics 
of the mixtures. 
6. Conclusions 
 The fundamental dehydrogenation properties of various LiBH4 samples have 
been investigated by use of XRD, TPR, TGA and TPD-MS characterizations. The 
Pd-Ni(OH)x has been used as catalysts and introduced to the as-received LiBH4 to 
enhance its dehydrogenation kinetics. The following conclusions have been obtained
