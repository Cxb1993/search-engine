The temperature in the piezoceramic specimen will increase rapidly with a short time 
period for high frequency resonant vibration. The design of the electrode on the two surfaces 
of the piezoceramic plate will influence the dynamic characteristics of the piezoceramic 
device and there are very few results available in the literature. In this three-year project, we 
employ an optical interferometry method called the amplitude-fluctuation electronic speckle 
pattern interferometry (AF-ESPI) to investigate the vibration characteristics of piezoceramic 
devices with different electrode design. Based on the fact that clear fringe patterns measured 
by the AF-ESPI method will be shown only at resonant frequencies, both the resonant 
frequencies and corresponding mode shapes are obtained experimentally at the same time. 
This project will focus on the dynamic characteristics of piezoelectric device (i.e., composite 
piezoceramic plate and shell) that the in-plane and out-of-plane modes are coupled. The 
influence of the electrode and temperature effect on the resonant vibration of piezoceramic 
devices will be discussed in detail. This project will also provide a reliable method for the 
determination of the material constants for piezoceramic material.  The numerical finite

I. INTRODUCTION 
Piezoelectric materials, which exhibit strong electromechanical coupling effects, have 
been widely used as actuators and sensors and have become one of the most important smart 
materials available. Electromechanical interactions in these materials are a result of both 
direct and converse piezoelectric effects. Piezoceramic plates can only act on a flat surface 
 4 
investigated by Tzou et al. [8, 13, 14] and has applications in aerospace technology, such as 
in rocket nozzles. The radial vibration of circular or annular piezoelectric plates was applied 
to multimode vibrators on ultrasonic motors by Takano et al. [16]. 
The free vibration analysis of a single panel piezoelectric cylindrical shell was studied 
by Rogacheva [17], and the linear theory of piezoelectric shells and plates was presented. 
Chen el al. [18] provided an exact elasticity solution for a piezoelectric cylindrical shell with 
a finite length, and the normalized displacements, electric potential, electric fields, and 
stresses were presented. Ding et al. [19] presented an exact three-dimensional free vibration 
analysis of a cylindrical piezoelectric panel by using the variable separation method. Yang et 
al. [20] used linear piezoelectric theory to analyze both the free vibration and electric force 
vibration solutions of the resonant frequencies and mode shapes for a cylindrical piezoelectric 
shell. Leissa and So [21] used the Ritz method to obtained accurate vibration frequencies of 
circular cylinders using free-free and free-fixed boundary conditions by means of 
three-dimensional analysis. Xu et al. [22] analyzed the basic vibration characteristics of a 
corrugated cylindrical piezoelectric shell transducer consisting of multiple pieces of circular 
cylindrical surfaces. Although there are theoretical solutions for a piezoelectric shell, the 
boundary conditions for most of the analysis were restricted to being simply supported, and 
there were no experimental measurement to verify the results. 
Some of the literature provided theoretical analyses of the three-dimensional vibrational 
characteristics of piezoelectric devices, and simplified piezoelectric equations were used to 
solve these approximate models. The resonance properties deduced from a one-dimensional 
model were described in the IEEE standard [23]. Ebenezer et al. expressed the infinite sets of 
solutions used to determine the forced responses of piezoelectric cylinders in terms of Bessel 
and trigonometric functions in the radial and axial directions, respectively [24]. Lin [25] 
investigated coupled vibrations in a sandwiched piezoelectric cylindrical transducer to obtain 
resonant frequencies by using an approximate analytic method, and radial vibration was used 
to study the relationship between resonance frequencies and geometric dimensions apart from 
the longitudinal resonance. Brissaud [26] studied the characterization of piezoceramics based 
on linear piezoelectricity, and resonance modes were treated as non-coupled modes for the 
rectangular plate, disk, and ring. Brissaud [27] proposed three-dimensional modeling of 
piezoelectric rectangular elements, thick disks, cylinders, thick rings, and hollow cylinders to 
analyze vibrational displacements and electric impedance, and the one-dimensional radial 
mode of the admittance of a thick disk was compared with experimental data. Here, the 
coupled phenomenon occurred when the piezoelectric element was driven into vibration, and 
the elastic and piezoelectric coupling effect existed inside the vibrating body and could not be 
suppressed. The amplitude of the vibrational displacement is usually dominated in a specific 
direction for different resonant modes. In this study, three experimental techniques are used to 
determine the resonance mode of the three-dimensional vibration for a piezoelectric 
 6 
the results obtained by AF-ESPI and predicted by FEM. Excellent agreement between 
experimental measurements and numerical calculations of the resonant frequencies and mode 
shapes is obtained. This study showed that there is no coupling at low resonant frequencies, 
over which the radial modes dominate. However, it is interesting to note that the 
three-dimensional vibration characteristics of coupled lateral, angular, and radial modes were 
found at high resonant frequencies, over which the lateral and angular modes dominate in the 
piezoelectric shell. This coupled phenomenon is evident from the measurements of AF-ESPI, 
LDV, and impedance analysis, and shown in the FEM calculation. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 
Three experimental techniques are used to measure the vibration characteristics for the 
piezoelectric shell, which are amplitude-fluctuation electronic speckle pattern interferometry 
(AF-ESPI), laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV), and impedance analysis. A brief introduction of 
these experimental techniques is described as follows. 
A.  Three-Dimensional Vibration Measurement by AF-ESPI  
AF-ESPI uses a time-average method to obtain the vibrational displacement of object 
motion during a single camera frame period. The resonant frequency and corresponding 
vibration mode shape can be obtained simultaneously. The self-arranged optical setup of the 
AF-ESPI is shown in Fig. 1 for both radial and lateral vibration measurements. In this setup, 
these two optical arrangements can be easily switched off by blocking the laser beams of the 
undesired measurement direction. The path of the laser beam for the radial measurement is 
shown as solid green lines and lateral measurement is shown as dash blue lines. The optical 
setup of the measurement for angular vibration is similar to that of lateral vibration. The only 
adjustment of optical setup required is to rotate the piezoelectric shell by ninety degrees. It is 
noted that the mode shape fringes obtained by AF-ESPI are not only qualitative, but also a 
quantitative full-field displacement measurement. Ref. [32] shows that the vibration 
displacements of mode shapes measured using AF-ESPI are identical to those measured using 
point-wise LDV. The AF-ESPI setup and theory were presented in detail by Ma and Huang 
[30].  The principle of the AF-ESPI optical technique for radial and lateral vibration 
measurement is briefly described as follows.   
When the specimen vibrates periodically at a specific frequency, digital images of the 
vibration are recorded by a charge-coupled device (CCD, Pulnix TM-7CN, Pulnix America, 
Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). According to the time-averaging method, the light intensity of the 
reference image can be described by the distribution ( , )I x y  and is expressed as 
0
1 2{ 2 cos[ (1 cos )cos ]} O R O RI I I I I A t dt
τ piφ θ ω
τ λ= + + + +∫ ,                   (1) 
where τ  is the CCD refresh time, OI  is the object light intensity, RI  is the reference light 
intensity, φ  is the phase difference between the object and reference light, λ  is the 
 8 
where θ ′  is half of the angle between the two illumination laser beams of the lateral setup, 
as indicated in Fig. 1. 
The fringe patterns obtained by AF-ESPI provide a quantitative experimental full-field 
measurement of vibrational displacement at resonance and are shown in Eq. (6) (or (7)), i.e., 
0 ( )J AΓ  (or 0 ( )J A′ ′Γ ). The related amplitude of the vibration displacement, iA  (or iA ′ ) 
( i = 1, 2, 3, 4…, n ), for the ith dark fringe in the mode shapes can be quantitatively 
calculated by taking the roots of 0 ( ) 0J AΓ =  (or 0 ( ) 0J A′ ′Γ = ) for radial (or lateral,  
angular) vibration. We use 017θ =  for the out-of-plane experimental setup, and the 
wavelength of the He-Ne laser was 8.632=λ  nm. The related vibration amplitudes for the 
first six dark fringes are iA (i = 1~6) = 125, 284, 446, 607, 769, and 930 nm.  The vibration 
amplitudes for the first six bright fringes are 0, 197, 361, 524, 686 and 848 nm.  We use 
θ ′= 045  for the in-plane vibration measurement, and the vibration amplitudes for the first six 
dark fringes are 170, 390, 612, 834, 1056, and 1278 nm. The vibration amplitudes for the first 
six bright fringes are 0, 271, 496, 719, 942 and 1165 nm. The amplitudes of vibration 
displacements obtained from the AF-ESPI method are determined by counting the number of 
fringes. It is noted that the vibration displacements obtained by the AF-ESPI measurement 
are in the order of sub-micrometer. The quantitative vibrating displacements measurement by 
AF-ESPI had been verified from LDV and FEM in [32] for piezoceramic bimorphs. It is very 
convenient to obtain the resonant frequencies and mode shapes at the same time by using 
AF-ESPI technique. However the vibration displacement is restricted from sub-micrometer to 
several micrometers. 
B.  LDV System 
The LDV system (Model name: AVID, Ahead Optoelectronics Inc., Chung-Ho, Taipei, 
Taiwan) provides a point-wise displacement measurement, which is perpendicular to the 
surface, with ultra-high resolution (on the order of nanometers) and has an extremely wide 
signal bandwidth (up to 20 MHz). The focus of the lens is 90 mm, and the size of the laser 
spot is 52 µm. The optical system is based on the principle of a Michelson interferometer and 
the Doppler effect. To avoid radio frequency electromagnetic interference caused by the high 
frequency signal driving the acoustic optical modulator, circular polarization interference is 
used. For measuring dynamic displacements, a swept-frequency response curve is obtained 
from built-in LabVIEW software processing the input/output signals of a RS-232 connection 
between the function generator and personal computer. The resonant frequencies of the 
piezoelectric shell can be identified from the peak values of the response curve. However, 
because the software system is limited by the memory capacity of the particular personal 
computer, the swept-sine excitation curve of the vibration response is only measured up to 
100 kHz. Although the LDV system can precisely measure the wide-range vibrational 
 10 
to determine the electromechanical coupling coefficients for specific resonant modes by using 
impedance analysis.  
III. DESCRIPTION OF PIEZOELECTRIC SHELLS  
The vibration of piezoelectric shells includes an electrical field coupled with elastic 
behavior.  The governing equation of the vibration characteristics for piezoelectric shells 
was described in detail by Tzou [10]. The linear piezoelectric constitute equations are

The analysis procedure to create an appropriate theoretical basis for a piezoelectric 
material, which includes both mechanical and electrical field variables, were described in 
detail in [23]. 
The piezoelectric shell used in this paper is composed of PZT ceramics (model number 
PIC-151, Physik Instrumente Company, Germany). The material constants are shown in Table 
 12 
this study, the eigenvalue solver and Lanczos algorithm are used to achieve rapid 
convergence.  The eigenvalue problem is solved to obtain the resonant frequencies and 
mode shapes [23, 26, 27]. It is noted that the local coordinate system for the piezoelectric 
shell is cylindrical. However, the mode shapes predicted by the finite element method are 
transformed to Cartesian coordinates in order to compare the results of the FEM model with 
experimental AF-ESPI measurements.  
In the analysis, the boundary conditions can be assigned as completely free or as any 
other constrained situations. The completely free boundary condition means that the 
specimen is, in fact, floating in space with no attachments or connections to ground and 
exhibits rigid body behavior at zero frequency. In the actual experiment, however, it is 
generally not possible to fully achieve this condition. Hence, the specimen must be supported 
in some manner to approximate the completely free boundary. Since the optical setup, as 
shown in Fig. 1, is put on a vibration isolated table, the perpendicular direction of the surface 
of specimen should be in the same plane as the table. It is not possible to hang the specimen 
in the air. In this study, the completely free boundary condition for the piezoelectric shell is 
approximated by sticking a small piece of adhesive tape on the surface of a sponge, and the 
effect of the adhesive tape is neglected in the FEM calculation. These experimental 
conditions may modify the resonance frequencies of the piezoelectric shell.  However, the 
experimental measurements showed that the influence on the resonant frequency and mode 
shape is negligible.  The results of the vibration characteristics, which include resonant 
frequencies, mode shapes, and normalized displacements, obtained by FEM and experimental 
results will be presented in next section. 
IV.  EXPERIMENTAL AND NUMERICAL RESULTS 
The results of the resonant frequencies and corresponding mode shapes obtained from 
AF-ESPI and FEM for the first 20 vibration modes of a piezoelectric shell with free boundary 
conditions are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The W mode shape represents the radial vibration 
mode along the z-direction, whereas the U and V mode shapes are the lateral and angular 
vibrational motion along the x- and y-directions, respectively. The excited voltages for 
specific vibration modes used in the AF-ESPI measurements and the normalized 
displacement components for W, U, and V mode shapes predicted by FEM are also shown in 
the same figure. The bright and dark fringes of the mode shapes measured using AF-ESPI are 
the contours of the constant vibrating displacements, and the brightest regions are indicated 
as the nodal lines. The full-field displacement contours (i.e., the mode shapes) are also 
presented in the FEM predictions. The dotted lines (with the −  sign) and solid lines (with 
the +  sign) indicate the opposite vibrating motion directions, and the transition from these 
two regions is indicated as the bold-solid line (i.e., zero-displacement line), which 
corresponds to the nodal line. The mode shapes obtained from the AF-ESPI measurement can 
 14 
from impedance analysis, are listed in Table II. The effK  value influences the excitation of 
mode shapes, which are shown in Fig. 4. Fringe patterns with larger electromechanical 
coupling coefficients have larger vibration amplitude, and less voltage is needed to excite the 
vibration modes. We can see from Table II that the I-3 mode (or the 14th mode) has the largest 
effK  value and it is evident from Fig. 4 that this mode has more fringe patterns and is more 
easily excited. It can be concluded from Fig. 4 and 5 that the piezoelectric shell has a 
three-dimensional vibration coupled phenomenon as long as the resonant frequencies can be 
measured by impedance analysis. 
The LDV is a point-wise measurement technique. To avoid selecting a point on the 
nodal line, five points on the quarter surface of the piezoelectric shell are used to measure the 
vibration displacements. Fig. 6 shows the response of vibrational displacement measured by 
LDV at lower frequencies, i.e., less than 28 kHz. The LDV measurements from low to high 
frequencies, up to 100 kHz, are performed to obtain the response curve of vibration resonance, 
as shown in Fig. 7. It is observed in Fig. 6 that for lower frequencies, a distinct resonant 
frequency can be easily identified. However, Fig. 7 shows that in the high frequency region 
where the radial, lateral, and angular motions are fully coupled, a wide-band frequency 
response is found and it is sometimes not easy to identify the resonant frequency. It can be 
concluded that in the high resonant frequency region, in which the lateral or angular modes 
dominate (i.e., Fig. 4), the radial motion cannot be neglected (i.e., Fig. 7). Hence, the 
three-dimensional vibration coupled phenomenon for piezoelectric shells, in which the lateral 
or angular modes dominate, observed in the experimental measurements (i.e., AF-ESPI (Fig. 
4), Impedance (Fig. 5) and LDV (Fig. 7)) and theoretical prediction (FEM). Table III lists the 
resonant frequencies obtained from AF-ESPI, impedance, LDV, and FEM. It shows that the 
discrepancies for the three experimental measurements are smaller than 2.87 %, which is less 
than the discrepancy (7.41 %) for the FEM results. 
From the aforementioned discussions, the FEM predictions of the vibration 
characteristics for the piezoelectric shell are in good agreement with the three experimental 
measurements of resonant frequencies, mode shapes, and normalized displacements. The 
normalized displacements of three-dimensional vibration analysis obtained by FEM are 
important parameters in predicting the dominant motion of the piezoelectric shell. It is 
evident from the experimental measurements that the dominant motion predicted by FEM 
indeed has a relatively larger displacement.   
The three-dimensional vibration characteristics analyzed based on the FEM calculation 
for the piezoelectric shell is further discussed by changing its geometric dimensions. The 
thickness t  and length l , as shown in Fig. 2, are fixed to be 1 mm  and 40 mm , 
respectively, and the arc length (i.e., r θ× ) is kept at 40 mm. The parameters r  and θ  for 
 16 
observed. The resonant frequencies measured by three experimental techniques, AF-ESPI, 
LDV, and impedance analysis, showed excellent agreement with finite element numerical 
calculation. The corresponding radial, lateral, and angular mode shapes obtained by AF-ESPI 
and predicted by FEM are also consistent. The normalized displacements and 
electromechanical coupling coefficient calculated by FEM can be used as the parameters for 
determining three-dimensional coupled vibration. The geometric parameters of the 
piezoelectric shell have a significant influence on the coupled phenomenon of mode shapes 
for three-dimensional resonant vibration. Generally, if lateral or angular vibration is the 
dominant motion, then the coupled phenomenon is easily observed experimentally as radial, 
lateral, and angular vibrations in the same resonant frequency. If a piezoelectric shell is used 
as an actuator or sensor, then the three-dimensional coupled phenomenon of vibration 
displacements have to be considered in each application.

2013年第三屆先進測量與測試國際研討會報告 
                      台大機械系 馬劍清教授 
會議名稱：2013 International Conference on Advanced Measurement and Test (AMT2013) 
派赴國家：中國大陸(廈門) 
報告日期：2013/03/23 
出國期間：2013/03/12~2013/03/16 
1. 參加會議經過 
本次先進測量與測試國際研討會(2013 International Conference on Advanced Measurement 
and Test)舉辦地點位於中國福建省廈門市諾亞方舟廈門金威酒店(King West Hotel)。此會議主題
包含材料科學、量測與測試、製造技術以及機械工程等四大主題，總共收錄 300多份文章，本
研究被安排在口頭報告。參與本次研討會之與會人員主要來自中國大陸、日本、印度及台灣等

力撞擊時之歷時訊號的新概念。 本研究主要探討 Timoshenko  樑理論對於不同厚度的懸臂樑
進行暫態波傳行為的預測能力。在理論計算的部分，使用拉普拉斯轉換法將配合 Timoshenko  
樑理論換至轉換域下，因為在拉普拉斯轉換域下的逆轉換運算通常相當複雜，為了提升理論計
算的效率與精確性，本研究使用 Durbin  拉普拉斯數值逆轉換的方式來獲得半解析與半數值
的理論解。研究中利用量測到的波源歷時，配合理論分析與有線元素法數值模擬軟體
(ABAQUS)，分析懸臂樑的暫態波傳行為，最後將理論分析與有線元素法數值計算的結果與實
驗量測比較，討論 Timoshenko 理論的正確性。 
 
參訪廈門大學孫道恆教授實驗室 
隨著通訊科技的進步以及兩岸政策的開放，兩岸學術交流已經相當熱烈。此行前往廈門參
予 AMT2013研討會，順道前往參訪廈門大學機電工程系孫道恆教授兼副院長及其實驗室。我
與孫道恆教授於 2004年同時前往加州大學柏克萊分校機械系林立偉教授實驗室訪問而認識。
