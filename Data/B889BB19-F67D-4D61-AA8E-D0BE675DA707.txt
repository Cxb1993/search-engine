different nonlinear optimization techniques. Silva
and Oliveira (2002) provided an efficient and
well-integrated methodology for the optimal su-
pervision of discontinuous processes. Soni and
Parker (2004) proposed an online re-optimization
strategy for closed-loop trajectory tracking and
disturbance rejection. Obviously, they all focus on
designing model-based predictive control to
achieve the output regulation.
4. Process Model
Consider the class of fed-batch penicillin
fermentations described by a model of the form:
,S in
dS X C u

dX X

dP X kP
dt

(1)
where u is the feed rate,
,S inC  is the substrate con-
centration in the feed, S, X and P are amounts of
substrate, biomass and product, respectively. The
specific rates (  ,  ,  ) are arbitrary functions,
which may depend on substrate, cell and product
concentrations, interrelated by:

where the substrate concentration /SC S V
and the biomass concentration /XC X V . All
values of model parameters are listed in Table 1
and the detailed symbolic explanations are shown
in the nomenclature section.
Operating specifications: The initial values of
biomass 0X  and product 0P  are fixed, but the ini-
tial value of substrate 0S  is adjustable. Moreover,
the final volume of fermentor fV  is shown by
0

SV V udt
C
    (3)
where
,S inC  represents the initial substrate concen-
tration in the feed, and *V represents the initial
volume without substrate. In regard to the secon-
dary metabolic process (Van Impe, 1998), product
synthesis is a result of two effects by the biomass
and product formation. In the first growth phase,
the biomass is produced as much as possible while
the high initial substrate concentration is consid-
ered. In the second production phase, the desired
product is produced from the cells as much as pos-
sible, but the substrate concentration should be
definitely decreased due to biomass constraint.
Process constraints: According to operating speci-
fications, process constraints are considered
[0, ]ft t  ： ,max( )X XC t C , ,max( )S SC t C  and
( )f fV t V (4)
Notably, state constraints by
,maxX XC C  and
,maxS SC C  are subject to avoid induction of un-
wanted side reactions and oxygen limitation, re-
spectively. In general, the feed input is bounded
between the lower bound minu  and the upper
bound maxu ,
min maxu u u  (5)
5. Measurement-based Optimization
Assuming process variables are measureable,
the optimization problem for the above fed-batch
fermentor is shown by.

where y  is the process output. By the repetitive
optimization procedure, the appropriate value of 
is obtained via the offline computation. Through
the optimal control sequence subject to the up-
dated model with the evaluated factor  , the cor-
rected (suboptimal) output trajectory is denoted as
the flexible reference spy . It means a “tube”
around the nominal output profile described by

Remark 3: Obviously, the presented optimization-
based control framework is an output feedback
structure with one tuning parameters ( mpck ). The
detailed control structure is depicted in Fig. 1.

and state constraints is used to predict the maxi-
mum amount of product at the final time ft =181 h
while guessing 1t =24.453 h and 2t =24.668 h. Re-
garding step 3, the analytic form of optimal singu-
lar control by Maple is shown in the appendix
section and its code is listed in Table 2, and
3t =122.348 h is determined while the amount of
substrate is consumed completely. Using the opti-
mal control sequence the optimal input/output pro-
files ( *y  and *u ) are shown in Fig. 2(c) and 2(d),
respectively. Afterwards, the flexible reference is
determined through the repetitive optimization
algorithm. Using both popular software Matlab
and Maple,  =0.05 is effectively evaluated for
the illustrated process with 10% step disturbance
in the feed. Fig. 3(a) depicts that the optimization-
based feedback control (our work) with a fixed
tuning parameter ( mpck ) = (0.01) can efficiently
recover the product amount to follow the pre-
scribed suboptimal trajectory (dashed-line). The
corresponding biomass concentration and input are
shown in Fig. 2(b) and 2(c), respectively. If the
55% change of max  as an uncertain parameter is
