Abstract 
Porosity is inevitably needed for dielectric 
materials with k below 2.5 in either 45 nm node 
or beyond. However, several key issues related 
to as-deposited porous dielectrics (k < 2.5) have 
been identified from their process integration. 
For example, porosity brings challenges on how 
to form a continuous metal diffusion barrier onto 
the exposed porous dielectric cross-section by 
etching step without reliability issue. In addition, 
porous low-k materials are mechanically weak 
compared to SiO2, indicating that they are prone 
to be damaged during CMP process. 
 
In order to circumvent the reliability issues 
encountered in integration of as-deposited 
porous dielectric, in this 3-years research project, 
a Solid-FirstTM scheme is employed for the 
preparation of low-k dielectric. We intend to 
examine the impact of medium-high temperature 
“porogens” in methylsilsesquioxane (MSQ) 
matrix on the materials properties of the 
MSQ/porogen, compared to those in dense MSQ 
and porous low-k directly formed after dielectric 
deposition. At first year, the mechanical 
properties of these three low-k system used in 
different integration schemes were investigated 
using nanoindenter and FTIR analysis for 
different porogen loading (porosity). The 
modulus of 2-phase films is higher than its 
porous form, and even better than dense one, for 
porogen loading below a critical quantity 
(~30%), which can be attributed to its enhanced 
degree of crosslinking in MSQ matrix. This 
implies that 2-phase low-k materials system can 
pass the CMP test while avoiding the barrier 
reliability issue.  
 
In the next year (2006-2007), we propose to 
characterize key materials properties such as 
dielectric constant of the novel 2-phase materials, 
and its process interactions with major backend 
processing steps as a function of porogens. This 
involves the studies on adsorption/desorption 
kinetics of moisture in three low-k systems, and 
different energy source to shorten required 
porogen decomposition time and examine its 
kinetics. In addition, their interactions with 
plasma etching chemistries in terms of etch 
characteristics, compatibility and process 
integration. 
 
I. Introduction 
The increasing of propagation (RC) delay 
becomes a limiting factor for ultra-large-scale 
integration (ULSI) of integrated circuits whose 
dimensions reduce beyond 130 nm [1]. As 
device technologies in 45 nm node and below, 
low-k materials with k < 2.5 are being fervently 
developed in order to reduce the increasing RC 
delay in the backend interconnects. So far, it is 
well recognized that incorporation of porosity is 
critical to the search of viable low-k materials 
with k < 2.5 for 45 nm technology node and 
beyond. The conventional porous low-k 
dielectric is generally formed after deposition of 
matrix with porogens, then burning out the 
porogen at high temperature. Several 
showstopper issues, However, related to 
as-deposited porous dielectrics (k < 2.5) have 
been identified from their process integration; 
namely: (1) device reliability due to large pore 
size (> 15 Å), (2) RC variation due to roughness 
in dielectric from etching, and (3) its wet 
chemical compatibility [2]. To circumvent these 
heating rate of 2 °C/min up to different final 
temperatures from 200 to 450 °C with 50 °C 
interval for 30 min.

high-temperature porogens. 
 
 
2. Thin film characterization 
The study of thermal decomposition 
temperature of porogens, whose mass loss was 
less than 2%, was carried out under a nitrogen 
atmosphere using a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments). 
The temperature scan speed was 10 °C/min and 
the temperature ranges from 30 to 600 °C. The 
porosities in porous low-k films were measured 
by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyzer. The 
measurements was performed using NOVA 
1000e (Quantachrome Instruments) with relative 
pressure (P/P0) from 1 to 0. 
 
 The chemical makeup and structural 
transformation in the MSQ matrix and 
MSQ/porogen 2-phase system as a function of 
temperature were studied using a 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). 
The measurements were performed using a 
MAGNA-IR Technology Protage 460 (Nicolet 
Inc.) in transmission mode with 32 scans at 
4cm-1 spectral resolution. Measurements of 
refractive index and film thickness were made 
using an n&k Analyzer 1280 (n&k Technology, 
Inc.) at the wavelengths ranging from 190 to 900 
nm.  
 
 Nanoindentation tests were carried out using a 
Nanoindenter (MTS, Nano Indenter XP system) 
with a Berkovich tip and continuous method to 
obtain reduced modulus (Er), and then the 
Oliver-Pharr method was applied to determine 
the elastic modulus (E) of various low-k films 
[8]. 
 
III. Results and Discussion 
Chemical and structural change of MSQ films 
at various curing temperatures at 50, 150, 250, 
300, 350 to 400 °C were first characterized by 
FTIR as shown in Figure 3. The Si-CH3 
absorption bands are found at 1273 and 781 cm-1, 
respectively and the corresponding CH3 
absorption band appears around 2972 cm-1. The 
two peaks at 1130 and 1035 cm-1 can be assigned 
to Si-O in the cage and network structures. Two 
distinct changes can be observed in Figure 3. 
The board O-H stretching band around 3400 
cm-1 and the Si-O stretching of the Si-OH bond 
at 903 cm-1 decrease in intensity gradually and 
disappear when temperature is greater than 300 
°C. This suggests that the condensation reaction 
of the Si-OH group takes place. Another distinct 
change is related to the peak intensities between 
1000 and 1200 cm-1. Finger 3 is FTIR absorption 
spectra of pure MSQ cured at various 
temperatures, which magnified from Figure 2. 
The intensity of the Si-O-Si absorption band of 
the cage structure at 1130 cm-1 decreases with 
increasing curing temperature, while the Si-O-Si 
absorption band of the network structure at 1030 
cm-1 shows the opposite trend. This indicates the 
transformation of the cage structure into the 
network structure through thermal curing. In 
addition, the degree on the cross-linking of the 
MSQ was determined by FTIR analysis to be 
50% at 100 °C and 80% at 400 °C, respectively. 
The major difference among the MSQ cured at 
300, 350 or 400 °C is their network/cage 
structure ratio, which may affect the mechanical 
after pyrolysis at 350 °C.

10% PS-b-P4VP as a porogen cured

For the rest of this report, we focus on the thin 
film properties at 300 °C for Solid-FirstTM, 
2-phase MSQ/porogen films and at 400 °C for 
porous low-k after removal of porogen. The 
insert in Figure 6 shows the relationship between 
porogen loading and porosity as measured by 
BET. The porosity of low-k films increases from 
6.5 to 36.4% as the porogen loading increases 
from 10 to 40%. The refractive indices of porous 
films versus porosity are shown in Figure 6. The 
refractive index of porous film decreases linearly 
from 1.38 to 1.20 as the porosity increases from 
0 to 37%. Table 1 summarizes the refractive 
index (n), optical dielectric constant by Maxwell 
relation (εfilm=n2) and ideal mixing rule [εfilm=(1-
φ )εMSQ + φ εporogen, φ =volume fraction of 
porogen] for porous films with various porosity. 
The deviation of optical dielectric constant from 
the estimated value by ideal mixing rule 
increases with increasing porosity. This implies 
that the porosity and its internal surface area may 
contribute to the increased moisture uptake, 
which in turn raises refractive index and optical 
dielectric constant.

Mechanical strength of low-k dielectric is one 
of significant concern in the backend processing 
such as chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) and 
die/packaging interaction. To evaluate the 
applicability of using MSQ/porogen through 
backend processes, elastic modulus was 
measured using nanoindentation technique. The 
elastic modulus of three low-k materials systems, 
MSQ at 400 °C and MSQ/PS-b-P4VP at 300 and 
400 °C, are shown in Figure 7. The moduli of the 
porous films cured at 400 °C drop with 
increasing the porosity. Furthermore, for 2-phase 
films cured at 300 °C, the modulus for film with 
10% porogen, 5.4 GPa is much higher than that 
of pure MSQ, 3.5 GPa, and then the modulus 
decreases with increasing the porogen 
(PS-b-P4VP) loading from 10 to 60%. In general, 
2-phase films cured at 300 °C are stronger than 
those of porous MSQ with 10 to 50% porogen 
loading. The incorporation of porosity or 
the presence of porogen becomes a steric barrier 
for MSQ molecular chains as schematically 
illustrated in Figure 11(b), thus reduce the 
collision probability of MSQ molecular chains 
for further crosslinking. Therefore, the reduced 
degree of crosslinking in MSQ with porogen 
>45% can be account for its lower mechanical 
strength even compared to those of porous MSQ 
cured at 400 °C. 
 
Finally we examine how these novel 2-phase 
low-k films will fare during 
chemical-mechanical polish step based on a 
SEMATECH study that a low-k material can 
pass the CMP test if its modulus is lager than 4 
GPa [10]. For porous MSQ films cured directly 
at 400 °C, the modulus of porous film becomes 
lower than 4 GPa when porogen loading is 
higher than 20% (porosity > 15%). In contrast, 
2-phase films prepared by novel Solid-FirstTM 
scheme, i.e. cured at 300 °C, possess modulus > 
4GPa for even larger porogen loading, ~40% 
(porosity ~ 35%).  That means we can use the 
same matrix and porogen to design and produce 
the ILDs with high porosity while the modulus is 
sufficient to survive backend process such as 
CMP step and avoid the barrier reliability issue.

IV. Conclusions 
Two high-temperature porogens, PS-b-P4VP 
copolymers and PS-b-PE-b-PS copolymers, and 
its 2-phase MSQ/porogen systems were studied 
for its mechanical and dielectric properties and 
feasibility in different integration schemes 
including solid-FirstTM and state-of-art 
damascene. The increase of decomposition 
temperature of the 2-phase porogen/MSQ system 
was attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen 
bonding between nitrogen atom of pyridine in 
PS-b-P4VP and OH group in MSQ. Based on the 
thermal stability and decomposition data of 
MSQ/PS-b-P4VP low-k system, the 2-phase 
films were recommended to be cured at 300 °C 
for subsequent damascene processing, then the 
porogen to be removed at 400 °C for 2 hours 
after CMP step to form metal/porous low-k 
structure.  
 
The mechanical properties of these materials 
used in different integration schemes were 
investigated using nanoindenter and FTIR 
analysis for different porogen, PS-b-P4VP, 
loading (porosity). The modulus of 2-phase films 
is higher than its porous form, and even better 
than dense one, for porogen loading below a 
critical level, which can be attributed to its 
enhanced degree of crosslinking in MSQ matrix 
due to the plasticization by high-temperature 
porogen. This implies that 2-phase low-k 
materials system can pass the CMP test while 
avoiding the barrier reliability issue. In addition, 
more aggressive k reduction without failing 
CMP test can be achieved using a 2-phase low-k 
materials system.
