treated with PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. First, wortmannin treatment enhanced Ins(1,4,5)P3 production and iNOS expression in LPS-activated
macrophages. Inhibition of PI3K by p85 siRNA also showed an enhancement of iNOS expression. On the other hand, overexpression of PI3K by
ras-p110 expression plasmid significantly decreased iNOS expression in LPS-activated macrophages. In addition, overexpression of wild-type or
dominant-negative Akt expression plasmid did not affect the iNOS expression in LPS-activated macrophages. Second, treatment of PI-PLC
inhibitor U73122 reversed the enhancement of iNOS expression, the increase of phosphorylation level of ERK, JNK and p38, and the increase of
AP-1-dependent gene expression in wortmannin-treated and LPS-activated macrophages. However, NF-κB activity determined by EMSA assay
and reporter plasmid assay did not change during LPS-activated macrophages with or without wortmannin. We propose that the inhibition of PI3K
by wortmannin in mouse macrophages enhances the PI-PLC downstream signals, and subsequently increases the LPS induction of iNOS
expression independently of Akt pathway.

bacteria. When LPS binds with a toll-like receptor 4 complex of
out membrane in macrophage, it induces the expression of many

iophluciferase activity by RenLite™ luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Packard
Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). Luminescence was measured on a Plate
Chameleon Multilabel plate reader. (HIDEX OY, Turku, Finland).
2.3. Western blot
Equal amounts of total cellular protein (50 μg) were resolved by SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and transferred onto Immobilon-P
membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously [27]. The
membrane was then incubated with an anti-iNOS antiserum (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA), anti-IκB antiserum, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-ERK, anti-
phospho-JNK, anti-JNK antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phos-
pho-p38, anti-p38 antiserum (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA),
or anti-α tubulin antiserum (Invitrogen Taiwan, Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan). The
membranes were subsequently probed with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG
antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence kits. The band densities
were quantitated by a computer densitometer (IS-1000 Digital Imaging
System).
2.4. RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from both of control and tested cultured cells, and
the mRNA level was detected by RT-PCR as described previously [21]. Four
sets of primers were used to amplify the cDNA of iNOS and GAPDH: iNOS,
forward primer 5′-CCCTTCCGAAGTTTCTGGCAGCAGC-3′, reverse primer
5′-GGCTGTCAGAGAGCCTCGTGGCTTTGG-3′; TNFα, forward primer 5′-
CGAAGGAGTTGGAGGTGTTTTCC-3′, reverse primer 5′-TTTATTGACT-
GAGGCACTGGGG-3′; IL-1β, forward primer 5′-GATCTGGACACT-
CAGGGTCTCATC-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCTCTGTCTTCTTGATGG-
GACCTG-3′; GAPDH, forward primer 5′-ACATCAAGAAGGTGGT-
GAAGC-3′, reverse primer 5′-CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGT-3′. For
measurement of mRNA stability, cells were pretreated with or without
100 nM wortmannin and stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS for 6 h, followed by
treatment with actinomycin D (4 μg/ml). Total RNA was prepared, and iNOS
mRNA was measured as above. Band densities were quantitated with a
computer densitometer (IS-1000 Digital Imaging System).
2.5. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear proteins and the 32P-labeled double-stranded AP-1 and NF-κB
oligonucleotide probe were prepared as described previously [24]. For DNA
binding reaction, 2 μg of nuclear proteins was mixed with 3 μl of the labeled
probe (approximately 5000 cpm) and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) poly(dI-dC) in a
reaction buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM
DTT) for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA–protein complex was
separated on 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gels before vacuum drying and
autoradiography. The specificity of NF-κB or AP-1 binding to its consensus
motif has been proved by supershift experiment as described previously [24].
2.6. Measurement of Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels
Cells were suspended in the PBS buffer, added with 0.2 volume of ice-cold
20% trichloroacetic acid, and kept on ice for 20 min. The protein sediment
was removed by centrifugation at 2000×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant
was neutralized with ice-cold 10 M KOH to pH 7.5. The KClO4 sediment was
removed by centrifugation at 2000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
was determined the Ins(1,4,5)P3 level using Inositol-1,4,5-Trisphosphate [

Radioreceptor Assay Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
2.7. Kinase assay
Equal amounts of total cellular protein (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated
D.-Z. Liu et al. / Biochimica et Bwith JNK or p38 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A/G-PLUS
agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 16 h at 4 °C. The JNK or p38 kinase
reaction was carried out in a final volume of 40 μl containing 1 μg Gst-ATF2addition, wortmannin also enhanced another two proinflam-
matory genes TNFα and IL-1β expression in LPS-activated
macrophage (Fig. 1D, lower panels). To further investigate
the enhancement of iNOS expression by wortmannin,
transient transfection was performed using mouse iNOS
luciferase promoter construct. Both PI3K inhibitor-wortman-
nin and LY294002 significantly enhanced iNOS promoter
activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E).
Wortmannin can inhibit PI3K activity, and therefore limit
Akt activity, but whether it is PI3K, or Akt, or both whichsubstrate, 10 μM cold ATP, 5 μCi [γ-32p] ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) and
incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Each sample was mixed with 10 μl of
5× Laemmli's loading buffer to stop the reaction, heated for 10 min at 100 °C,
and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously [24]. Gels were dried and
visualized by autoradiography.
2.8. Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean of S.E. for the indicated number of
independently performed experiments. Statistical analysis was done using one-
way Student's t test.
3. Results
3.1. Akt pathway was not involved in the increase of iNOS
expression in wortmannin-treated macrophages
Wortmannin has been shown to inhibit PI3K activity and
result in lower downstream Akt phosphorylation levels. To
test the effect of wortmannin on the inhibition of PI3K
activity in RAW 264.7 macrophage, we detected the
phosphorylation level of Akt by Western blot. The cells
were pretreated with wortmannin for 30 min, then stimulated
with 50 ng/ml LPS for various time periods (0.5–4 h). As
shown in Fig. 1A, 100 nM of wortmannin significantly
inhibited the phosphorylation level of Akt in LPS-activated
macrophages. Next, we found that wortmannin enhanced
LPS-induced iNOS protein expression about 4.2-fold in the
presence or absence of serum (Fig. 1B). In wortmannin-
treated cells, the induction of iNOS protein expression
occurred early, at 4 h after LPS treatment, peaked at 14 h,
and was sustained for 36 h. However, iNOS protein
expression occurred late at 9 h and terminated at 36 h in
the cells treated with LPS alone (Fig. 1C). Further work was
done to determine whether wortmannin enhanced iNOS
expression at the transcription level. RT-PCR results showed
that wortmannin indeed enhanced the iNOS mRNA expres-
sion (Fig. 1D upper panel); indicating that enhancement of
iNOS expression by wortmannin was due to the increase of
iNOS gene expression. Using actinomycin D (an RNA
transcription inhibitor), we examined whether wortmannin
could enhance iNOS mRNA stability and then increase the
mRNA level and its translation product. Results indicated
that wortmannin-enhanced iNOS expression did not result

formation and wortmannin enhanced the Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation
in the presence of LPS in a dose-dependent manner. The results
suggest that inhibition of PI3K can increase the PtdIns(4,5)P2
hydrolyzed by PI-PLC.
To further confirm the involvement of the PI-PLC pathway
in the wortmannin-enhanced iNOS expression, the PI-PLC
inhibitor U73122, PC-PLC inhibitor D609, calcium chelator
Bapta-AM, and PKC inhibitor chelerythrine chloride were used.
When cells were pretreated with wortmannin, LPS-induced
iNOS expression was enhanced (Fig. 4A and B, lane 3);
however, the enhancement of iNOS expression disappeared in
U73122-treated cells but not in D609-treated cells (Fig. 4A and
B, lane 5). Activation of PI-PLC can increase DAG and Ins
(1,4,5)P3 levels, and these events subsequently activate PKC
and increase cytoplasmic calcium levels, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 4C and D, the wortmannin-enhanced iNOS
expression was decrease in LPS-activated cells with cheler-
ythrine chloride (Fig. 4C, lane 5); however, Bapta-AM did not
affect the iNOS expression in LPS-activated cells with or
without wortmannin (Fig. 4D, lane 5). These results suggest that

These results suggest that the enhancing effect of wortmannin
on LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 and
AP-1-dependent gene expression might be mediated by
activation of PI-PLC-dependent signal pathways. To further
understand which MAPKs members are involved in the
enhancement of iNOS expression in wortmannin-treated cells,
three MAPKs members' inhibitors were used. Western blot and
kinase activity assay showed U0126 (1 and 5 μM), SP600125
(10 and 20 μM), and SB203580 (7.5 and 15 μM) dose-
dependently inhibited ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase activity
respectively, indicating these concentrations were effective to
inhibit MAPKs members (Fig. 6D lower panels). Next, we
examined these MAPKs inhibitors on the iNOS expression in
Fig. 5. Inhibition of PI3K resulted in enhancement of MAPKs phosphorylation but

6D upper panel, wortmannin enhanced iNOS expression (lane
3) in LPS-activated cells, and U0126 and SP600125 signifi-
cantly abrogated wortmannin-enhanced iNOS expression in a
dose-dependent manner. However, SB203580 did not reverse
the enhancement of iNOS expression in wortmannin- and LPS-
treated cells. These results suggest that ERK and JNK involved
in the wortmannin-enhanced iNOS expression in LPS-activated
cells.
4. Discussion
Several studies have demonstrated Akt to be involved in
the NF-κB signaling pathway in cells treated with PI3K
inhibitor. In the present study, we investigated the effect of a
not NF-κB activity. (A–C) Cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor-wortmannin
sates were analyzed byWestern blot (A and B), or nuclear proteins were extracted
re transfected with NF-κB or AP-1 reporter plasmid and phRL-TK plasmid as an
for 30 min and then LPS (50 ng/ml) for 4 h or 8 h. Cells were harvested, and the

nin treatment. Previous studies have shown that both AP-1
and NF-κB transcription factors play a role in PI3K-Akt
downstream pathways, but NF-κB signaling is controversial
in the regulation of downstream gene expression. Several
reports have demonstrated that PI3K-Akt positively or
negatively regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression, but
that may be due to different cell types and different inducers.
Other studies have also shown that the antiapoptotic effects of
PI3K-Akt are independent of NF-κB in human hepatocytes
[38]. In this study, we demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt
pathway did not affect the NF-κB activity in wortmannin-
treated cells as determined by IκB degradation, NF-κB
binding assay (EMSA), and reporter plasmid assay. On the
other hand, we showed that the MAPKs pathway and AP-1
transcription factor positively regulated iNOS expression in
wortmannin-treated cells. The phosphorylation level of
MAPKs and AP-1-dependent gene expression fell in
wortmannin-treated cells with U73122. In addition, ERK
inhibitor and JNK inhibitor reversed the enhancement of
iNOS expression in wortmannin- and LPS-treated cells. A
model of LPS induction of iNOS in mouse macrophages was
shown in Fig. 7. The current study suggests that LPS
stimulation of macrophages leads to activation of both the
PI3K and PI-PLC pathways, and that inhibition of PI3K
pathway by wortmannin leads to enhanced PI-PLC down-
stream signals. Enhancement of PI-PLC increases the
877iophysica Acta 1773 (2007) 869–879airway smooth muscle cells independently of PI3K inhibition
[30]. ATF3 induction by LY294002, but not wortmannin,
occurred partially through Egr-1 transcription factor and
independent of the PI3K pathway in human colorectal cancer
cells [17]. Another report demonstrated that LY294002
bound with estrogen receptor and inhibited the estrogen
response gene expression induced by 17β-estradiol [31].
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression was also
inhibited by LY294002 but through a PI3K-independent
pathway [32]. These results suggest that, unlike wortmannin,
LY294002 has target molecules besides PI3K, and wortman-
nin is a more specific PI3K inhibitor. Interesting, we found
that wortmannin-enhanced iNOS expression was also inde-
pendent of the PI3K/Akt pathway and dependent on the PI-
PLC pathway. Knockdown of PI3K gene by p85 siRNA
enhanced iNOS expression in LPS-activated macrophages. In
contrast, activation of PI3K by transfection of ras-p110
expression plasmid limited the enhancement of iNOS
expression. Furthermore, we found that wortmannin enhanced
Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation in LPS-activated macrophages, and
inhibition of PI-PLC limited the wortmannin-enhanced iNOS
expression. This suggests that the PI-PLC pathway mediates,
at least in part, wortmannin-enhanced iNOS expression in
mouse macrophages.
Although several reports have demonstrated the involve-
ment of the PI-PLC and PC-PLC in LPS-induced iNOS
expression, which one participates in wortmannin-enhanced
iNOS expression is still unknown. In the present study, both
PI-PLC inhibitor U73122 and PC-PLC inhibitor D609
inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression, but only U73122
markedly limited wortmannin-enhanced iNOS expression
(Fig. 4A and B). Another result showed that wortmannin
increased Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, further suggesting that PI-
PLC was indeed involved in wortmannin-enhanced iNOS
expression. A recent report indicated that PI-PLC activation
might be mediated by protein tyrosine kinase and that PI-PLC
might have led to PtdIns(4,5) hydrolysis in LPS-activated
macrophages [33]. Since it has been demonstrated that
calcium had a opposed role in the regulation of iNOS
expression, that either stimulatory [34,35] or inhibitory
[36,37] effects. Unexpectedly, calcium seems to be unin-
volved in the iNOS expression of mouse RAW264.7
macrophages in this study. When RAW264.7 macrophages
were treated with calcium chelator Bapta-AM, iNOS expres-
sion showed no significant change in LPS-activated cells with
or without wortmannin (Fig. 4D). The results suggest that Ins
(1,4,5)P3 might be mediated by signaling pathways besides
calcium to induce iNOS expression.
To clarify which signal pathways were associated with
wortmannin-enhanced iNOS expression, the phosphorylation
level of MAPKs and IκB degradation, as well as AP-1 and
NF-κB activities, were assessed by Western blot, EMSA
assay, and reporter luciferase assay, respectively. We found
that wortmannin enhanced the phosphorylation level of
D.-Z. Liu et al. / Biochimica et BMAPKs-ERK, JNK, p38, and AP-1 binding and reporter
activities (Fig. 5). However, IκB degradation and NF-κB
binding and reporter activities were unchanged by wortman-formation of DAG and Ins(1,4,5)P3, which then stimulates
PKC, ERK and JNK, AP-1 and other unknown signaling

inhibiting PI3K. First, inhibition of PI3K may lead to accumulation of
PtdIns(4,5)P2, resulting in increased conversion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 into DAG
and Ins(1,4,5)P3 by PI-PLC. Second, DAG may activate PKC, and Ins
(1,4,5)P3 may activate unknown signals but not calcium, which in turn
induces iNOS expression. Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PI3K,
