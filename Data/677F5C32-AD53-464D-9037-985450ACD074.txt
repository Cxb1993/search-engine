8-Hydroxydaidzein is a biotransformed metabolite of soy isoflavone daidzein by the2
fungi Aspergillus saitoi or A. oryzae. (1-2) The compound has been proven to be a potent3
mushroom tyrosinase inhibitor. (3) The reaction mechanism of the inhibitor was demonstrated4
to be an irreversible mode and belonged to a suicide substrate type of tyrosinase. (4) Because5
rare potent irreversible inhibitors were found, the compound has great potential in the6
whitening cosmetics industry. However, when the compound was applied to cosmetics7
products, it was found that 8-hydroxydaidzein was unstable in the formulated cream at longer8
storage times (unpublished data). The instability property of this compound is very critical for9
its applications. In order to resolve the instability problem of 8-hydroxydaidzein, stabilities of10
8-hydroxydaidzein in various solutions were investigated.11
At first, both a phosphate buffer and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used to dissolve12
8-hydroxydaidzein, and the residues of the compound in the prepared solutions were13
determined by using a HPLC method. 8-Hydroxydaidzein was purified as described in our14
earlier work (3) and dissolved in acetone as a stock with a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The15
stock of the compound was diluted 20-fold to a concentration of 100g/ml of either 50 mM16
pH 6.8 phosphate buffer or DMSO. Then, the diluted solutions in 1.5 ml tubes covered with17
alumni fossil to avoid light were placed on the bench at 25 ? for 15 to 18 days. During the18
storage time, samples (20l) were taken out for the HPLC analysis in the determined interval19
times. As shown in Figure 1A, when 8-hydroxydaidzein was dissolved in the pH 6.820
phosphate buffer, the compound was quickly degraded. In contrast, when the compound was21
dissolved in DMSO, the compound remained at 80% after 18 days’storage. Kinetic analyses22
showed that 8-hydroxydaidzein loss in both solvents was apparently the result of first-order23
reactions (Figure 1B). The loss rate constants of 8-hydroxydaidzein in the phosphate buffer24
and DMSO were 4.48 x 10-3 and 2.5 x 10-4 hour-1, respectively.25
The above results showed that the utilized solvent would dramatically affect the stability26
of 8-hydroxydaidzein in the solution. There were three possible reasons for the instability of27
the compound in the pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. One is that the compound might react with28
6stability of soy isoflavones. In this study, a soy isoflavone derivative, 8-hydroxydaidzein, was1
demonstrated to be unstable in alkaline solutions. In fact, daidzein itself, the biotransformed2
precursor of 8-hydroxydaidzein, would be stable in both pH 7 and pH 9 buffers at 25 ? (data3
not shown). Hence, to understand the detailed mechanism causing the instability of4
8-hydroxydaidzein in alkaline solutions, more study is needed.5
Besides being a potent irreversible inhibitor toward mushroom tyrosinase (3-4),6
8-hydroxydaidzein also contained strong antioxidant activity (1-2), anti-mutagenic activity (8),7
anti-aldose reductase activity (9), and anti-proliferation activity toward cancer cell lines. (10)8
Because the multi-functional bioactivities of 8-hydroxydaidzein, it is expected that broad9
application and high quality will be needed for storage of the compound. Hence, according to10
the data in the present report, it is recommended that 8-hydroxydaidzein should be formulated11
in an acid solution for its application in whitening cosmetics, foods, or medical agents.12

stored at 25 ? and 8-hydroxydaidzein were analyzed by HPLC. The HPLC analysis4
was performed on a Hitachi D-7000 HPLC (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) system5
equipped with a L-7400 UV detector and a 250 × 4.6 mm i.d., ODS 2 Spherisorb6
C18 reversed-phase column (Phase Separation Ltd, Deeside Industrial Park, Clwyd,7
UK). The operating conditions were as follows: solvent; 30% acetonitrile/water8
containing 1% acetic acid, flow rate; 0.8 mL/min, detection; 262 nm, injected9
volume; 20L from 1 mL assay system containing 100g 8-hydroxydaidzein /ml of10
either DMSO or phosphate buffer. The residual 8-hydroxydaidzein of each sample in11
the determined interval times was calculated by fitting the HPLC area of the sample12
to a standard curve of 8-hydroxydaidzein ranged from 0 to 100g/ml13
concentrations.14
