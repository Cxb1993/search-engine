2Introduction
For phase transformations of steels from austenite to ferrite during cooling
from high temperatures, Widmanstatten side-plate, massive, and martensitic phases
formed in the austenitic matrix [1]. In contrast to the phase transformations of the
steels during cooling, ferrite to austenite phase transformations have been found in
Fe-Mn-Al alloys. Product phases such as Widmanstatten side-plate [2], massive [3],
and 18R type martensitic phases [4] have also been observed in the ferritic matrix of
the alloys.
In the isothermal phase transformations of low alloy steels and stainless steels
at low temperatures, various carbides, such as MC, M3C, M5C2, M7C3 and M23C6,
have been found to precipitate in the steels [5-12]. The crystal structures of the
carbides are as follows: MC is cubic (B1), M3C is orthorhombic (D011), M5C2 is
monoclinic (C2/c), M7C3 is complex hexagonal (P31C), and M23C6 is complex FCC
(D84) [13]. The M3C carbide, named cementite, with an othorombic crystal structure
is the well-known carbide in steels. Cementite forms in carbon steels on tempering
between 523 and 973 K [1]. The M23C6 carbide has a complex FCC crystal structure.
The M23C6 carbide precipitates on either austenitic or ferritic grain boundaries of the
low alloy steels and stainless steels, and exhibits a cubic to cubic orientation
relationship with one of its neighboring grains [6-10].
For the Fe-Mn-Al-C alloys undergoing phase transformations at low
temperatures, -carbide [14-17] and M23C6 carbide [18] have been observed to
precipitate in the parent grains of the alloys. The-carbide with a L12 crystal structure
could coherently precipitate in the austenitic matrix of the alloy after being quenched
from high temperature. The mechanism for the precipitation of the coherent-carbide
in the austenitic matrix during cooling could attribute to the Spinodal decomposition
[15,16]. The M23C6 carbide was found once in a Fe-26.6 Mn-8.8 Al-0.61 C (wt%)
alloy comprising a dual phase structure of austenite and ferrite [18]. The M23C6
carbide formed on the austenite-ferrite interphase interface. It seems that the M23C6
carbide nucleated on the γ-α interphase boundary, exhibited a cubic to cubic
orientation relationship with the austenite grain, i.e., [001]C//[001]γand (200)C//(200)γ
where the subscript c refers to the M23C6 carbide and to FCC matrix, and grew into
the ferrite grain without any orientation relationships.
4XRD analysis illustrates the coexistence of FCC and HCP phases in the high
manganese steel. Some peaks with which Miller indexes are underlined come from
the FCC matrix and FCC martensite, and the others are from the HCP martensite. The
high-temperature phase of the steel at 1373 K is austenite. The austenite phase has
been reserved in the as-quenched condition. The martensites formed in the austenitic
grains during cooling from high temperature. We verified that the martensites are
composed of not only the well-known HCP -martensite, but also FCC micro-twin
[23].
Fig. 2(a) displays the OM of the steel after being solution heat treated at 1373
K and aged at 873 K for 100 h. The morphology of the austenitic grains is similar to
that of the steel in the as-quenched condition, except on some parts of the grain
boundaries. Precipitates have nucleated and grown on some of the austenitic grain
boundaries as the arrows indicate the locations of the M23C6 carbide, for example, in
Fig. 2(a). The XRD analysis of the alloy with the same aging process as that of Fig.
2(a) is shown in Fig. 2(b). Due to lack of sufficient amount of the precipitate, no
peaks coming from the precipitate are revealed in the XRD analysis of Fig. 2(b). Thus,
we performed the TEM study in order to identify the crystal structure of the grain
boundary precipitate.
Figures 3(a) and (b) show the TEM analysis of the high manganese steel with
the same heat treatment as Fig. 2(a). Fig. 3(a) is the TEM bright-field image which
reveals the precipitates growing along the grain boundary. The precipitates are marked
with C, the austenitic grains with, and the grain boundary with GB as shown in Fig.
3(a). Fig. 3(b) is the selected area diffraction pattern (SAD) covering with both of the
precipitate on the upper-middle region and its neighboring austenitic grain at left-side.
Tilting the specimen to some other zone axes of the precipitate, we confirmed that the
grain boundary precipitate is M23C6 carbide. The crystal structure of the M23C6
carbide belongs to a complex FCC. The lattice parameter of the M23C6 carbide is
approximately equal to 1.057 nm. The zone axes of the M23C6 carbide and FCC
matrix are along the [100] direction in the SAD of Fig. 3(b). The Miller indexes of the
FCC matrix are underlined to distinguish them from those of M23C6 carbide. From the
SAD of Fig. 3(b), the cubic to cubic orientation relationship exists between the M23C6
carbide and FCC matrix, i.e., [001]C//[001]γand (200)C//(200)γ. The compositions of
the M23C6 carbide and austenitic matrix were examined by the EDS equipped in TEM.
6Conclusions
In conclusions, we have investigated that M23C6 carbide precipitates along the
austenitic grain boundary of the high manganese steel after the solution heat treatment
at 1373 K and aging process at 873 K. So far M23C6 carbide was found in the binary
Mn-C and quaternary Fe-Mn-Al-C systems, and no literature indicates that M23C6
carbide exists in the ternary Fe-Mn-C system. Thus, the discovery of the M23C6
carbide fills the gap for the absence of the M23C6 carbide in the ternary Fe-Mn-C
system. Thus, it is the first experimental evidence to show the M23C6 carbide existing
in the ternary Fe-Mn-C steels. The M23C6 carbide has a complex FCC crystal structure
with a lattice parameter of a=1.057 nm. As the M23C6 carbide precipitates on the
austenitic grain boundary, it exhibits the cube to cube orientation relationship with one
of its neighboring austenitic grains. The orientation relationship is as follows:
[001]C//[001]γand (200)C//(200)γ. The metal constituents of the M23C6 carbide and
austenitic matrix without carbon in a 100% basis are Fe(65.5)-Mn(34.6) and
Fe(78.2)-Mn(21.8), respectively. The content of manganese of M23C6 carbide is higher
than that of the austenitic matrix.
