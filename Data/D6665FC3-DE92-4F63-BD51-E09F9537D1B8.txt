本計畫擬探討輸出回授系統之可變結構控制問題，在系統不確定因子(uncertainties)符合匹配條件
(matching condition)的前提之下，其順滑曲面函數(sliding function)與系統輸出(system output)之間存在
著一個特殊的動態映射(dynamic mapping)關係，而且，此映射關係與原系統之不確定因子完全無關
(invariant)。 
 
在單一輸入單一輸出(single-input-single-output, SISO)系統中，上述的動態映射關係可以用一個｢順滑曲
面函數→系統輸出｣之轉移函數(transfer function)來描述，此轉移函數的極點(poles)正是控制設計者所
預設之順滑模式之動態(sliding dynamics)，而此轉移函數的零點(zeroes)則是原系統的零動態(zero 
dynamics)。 
 
在輸出回授控制架構下，系統的狀態向量(state vector)無法經由量測而得，故頇使用可得的系統輸出
變數來反推其順滑變數，藉以作為可變結構控制的法則切換依據。故此，一個｢系統輸出→順滑曲面
函數｣的逆運算問題因應而生。 
 
本計畫著眼於 SISO 系統順滑曲面函數與系統輸出的動態映射關係之推導分析、逆運算的架構探討、
逆運算補償器(inverse compensator)的穩定性、順滑變數之追蹤與誤差收斂、逆運算補償器的數位實現

Abstract 
 
 The problem of variable structure output feedback control (VSOFC) is under study. There exists a 
dynamic mapping relationship between the sliding variable and the output variable in a linear, time-invariant 
(LTI), single-input-single-output (SISO) system. It is invariant of the matched disturbances, which lie in the 
control space. Furthermore, this relationship can be described as a transfer function from the sliding variable 
to the system output variable. The poles correspond to the sliding dynamics prescribed by the designer; while, 
the zeroes correspond to the zero dynamics of the original system.  
 
This is a study of inverse method to reconstruct the prescribed sliding surface, which was originally designed 
with the assumption of full state accessibility. Due to the presence of unknown disturbances, we choose not 
to use a state observer but to design a dynamic inverse compensator by using the system inversion method. It 
will be proven that the sliding variable can be reconstructed from the system output if minimum phase on the 
original SISO system is imposed. Thus the variable structure control (VSC) law can be implemented without 
full state accessibility.

畫提出一種 VSOFC 的新觀念，乃結合信號處理(Signal Processing)領域中眾所熟知的逆向方法(inverse 
method)，利用系統輸出(system output)之量測信號，透過逆運算補償器(inverse compensator)來重建 VSS
的順滑曲面函數，以作為 VSC 控制法則之切換依據，其架構方塊圖如下所示： 
 
 
圖一、逆運算補償輸出回授可變結構控制架構 
 
上圖 u(t)為控制法則，v(t)為外來干擾(external disturbances)。此架構有別於現今既有常用的 VSOFC 方
法，其中順滑曲面函數Σ(x)係以全狀態 x 可取得的假設下所設計的，故可依理想狀況進行Σ的設計，
而不需受制於可量測的系統輸出信號 y。換言之，此 VSS 系統之順滑曲面變數是 x 的靜態函數，Σ(x)，
而不是 y 的靜態函數，Σ(y)。此外，Σ的計算係將系統輸出信號 y 以動態逆運算行之，故上圖逆運算
補償器之輸出信號為 ˆ而非真正的Σ，亦即， ˆ與Σ兩者之間存在一個動態追蹤的關係。綜言之，本
研究的重點乃為設計一合宜的動態逆運算補償器，使得 )()(ˆlim xt

3.1 理論構想架構 
 本計畫的初始創意受到我們先前研究 [24]的啟發，在 [24]的研究中使用一動態後置濾波器
（post-filter）將輸出訊號轉化為動態的順滑模態函數，它透露出 Σ(t)和 y(t)二者間隱含一種動態的對映
關係，以圖二描述之：  
 
圖二、“動態映射”理論構想架構 
 
對一個可變結構系統而言，運用輸入—輸出觀點可得到二個 “動態映射” （dynamic mapping），其一從
輸入控制量 u(t)與未知干擾量 v(t)經系統狀態空間 x(t)到順滑變數 Σ(t)，另一個從輸入控制量 u(t)與未知
干擾量 v(t)經系統狀態空間 x(t)到輸出變數 y(t)。如圖三所描述，順滑變數 Σ(t)與輸出變數 y(t)可分別視
為相關動態映射的值域（image），對這二個值域而言，若能建立其間的“動態映射”關係，則可排除輸
入控制量 u(t)及未知干擾量 v(t)的影響。首先推導 Σ(t)至 y(t)的動態映射關係，一旦此動態映射關係是可
逆的，則我們能僅運用 y(t)來重現 Σ(t)。也就是說只要由 Σ(t)至 y(t)的“順向映射” 成立，則求其“逆向映
射”便是標準的逆運算問題（inverse problem），我們可進一步借用現存的系統逆向理論求解 [28-30]。

輸入控制量 u(t)及未知干擾量 v(t)。 
令“順向映射”(9)中的初始狀態值為 z1(0) = z10，我們可發現要精準的運用 y(t)來重現 Σ(t)仍需要
z1(0)，當系統狀態無法量測時 z1(0)也不可得，然而以系統穩定度的觀點而言，我們可採用類似狀態估

其中為任意複數（complex number）。{Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd}的傳輸零點定義為一組使得不等式 rank [P()] < n
成立[29]，此定義與順向映射是否可逆有關，其可逆的充分和必要條件是擴充方陣(12)擁有有限的傳輸
零點，也就是 P()屬於非衰頹型式[29]。若順向映射確實可逆，我們將推導逆向映射並運用拉普拉斯轉
換（the Laplace transform）技巧來證明此結果。 
在文獻[30]中 Broussard 假設 z10 = 0 的條件來推導逆函數，但這只能稱為特例，令(t)代表一步階函

觀察 det(I – sQa) = 0 的解提供了此動態補償器(22)的全部有限極點（finite poles），由最小相位的假設可

Assume that   is designed such that the left and right deriva-
tive polynomials in (5) are coprime with each other. As can be seen
in (5), the mapping from   to  , denoted , excludes both  
and  . It reveals a clue to reconstructing   without the need of
the state vector  . Note also that the system parameters, 

, are not
present in (5). If the system (1) is minimum phase with relative degree
one, one can simply construct the proper dynamic filter to convert  
into   with the assumption of zero initial condition [12]. However,
if the system relative degree is greater than one, or    	, it
becomes improper and fails to meet the causality condition for realiza-
tion. Therefore, the problem considered in this note now is to find an
inverse mapping,  :     , for the case when the original
system input-output relative degree   is greater than or equal to one,
that is   	 

so as to accurately retrieve the sliding variable instantaneously for

equate to simply have asymptotic tracking for the   as we usually
see in state observers. In this note, we utilize the inverse methods to
derive a dynamic filter which provides us with a stable estimate,  ,
that converges in time to the true value of  .

Since the derivative polynomials in (5) are coprime with each other
by design, 

	 is minimal. In the SISO case, the system
zeros, the invariant zeros, and the transmission zeros all coincide. Con-

only if the augmented matrix    is nondegenerate [14]. Hence, the
derivation of   becomes a standard inverse problem.
In [15], an inverse compensator is proposed if the system is relaxed
at 

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL, VOL. 55, NO. 8, AUGUST 2010 1973
in which all finite poles of  

It is an interesting observation that the error dynamics  
 
  between
  and its estimated version is determined solely by the eigenvalues
of 

. As asserted in [15], [16], each nonzero transmission zero of
the original system is reciprocal to an eigenvalue of 

. Thus, the in-
verse dynamic compensator (19) is stable if and only if    




 has no zeros in the closed right half-plane.
V. DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATION OF INVERSE COMPENSATOR
If the SISO system is of relative degree one as well as minimum
phase, there is neither implementation nor stability problems with the
inverse compensator (19). For the case of  	 , implementation
of (19) becomes a noncausal problem. Similar situation occurs in the
static VSOFC methods and the UIOs for (1) (e.g., [2]–[4] and [6], [7]).
However, as asserted in [17] and [18], the sampled-data formulation
of the original SISO system has input-output relative degree one in
general. Therefore, we propose a discrete-time approximation of (19)
which can be realized physically in the computer-controlled systems
to circumvent the noncausality problem. Let 
 be the sampling period,


    
 , and 

 
 . The dynamic mapping (19a) leads to

At the cost of an 

is able to put (19) into a causal form for the digital implementation
(24). It is equivalent to the emulation mapping pair,     


   , onto a stable region in the -plane with     





. If Lemma 2 holds, the approximation (23) is able to further
preserve the stability of the continuous-time inverse compensator (19).
The following Lemma ensures stability of the proposed discrete-time
inverse compensator.
Lemma 3: The eigenvalues of  

 




lie within the unit
circle if no eigenvalues of

lie in the right-hand half of the complex
plane.
Proof: Let  be an eigenvalue of

and   be the associated eigen-
vector. Since no eigenvalues of

lie in the right-hand half of the com-
plex plane, the positive number 
 cannot be an eigenvalue of 

, i.e.,
  
 . We have 

     and
 

 
      
   (25)
Obviously,    
  is an eigenvlue of the matrix  

 
. Fur-
thermore,  

 
 is invertible if and only if  

 ,
(25) can be rewritten as  
     




 . It means that
   
  is an eigenvalue of the matrix  

 

 and that   is
the associated eigenvector.
Pre-multiplying the equation 

It is evident that the controller-compensator separation principle holds
with the inverse compensator error dynamics being asymptotically
stable, independent of the control dynamics. Thus, the switching term

designed properly, the forward mapping  :       is always
causal and stable. Under the output minimum phase condition, its in-
verse counterpart   :      is also stable but may encounter
the noncausality problem. In this case, we have shown that the for-
ward difference integration emulation can put the stable, noncausal,
continuous-time inverse compensator into a stable, causal formulation
in discrete-time.
It is interesting to observe that some other variables of interest, not
necessarily the sliding variable alone, can be tracked by using the same
idea of this note. Since the forward dynamics (8a) contains   im-
plicitly, it suggests that we can take one more step further to retrieve
the state variables 

through an observer by feeding in
tracked sliding variable into the already stabilized dynamics of (8a).
By doing so, the proposed inverse compensator idea can be extended
to more general control applications beyond that of variable structure
control.

Due to this invariance condition, there exists an m×r matrix
G such that
D = BG. (3)
Hence, D1 = B1G and D2 = B2G.
Our objective is to find a sliding mode control law to
achieve both system stability and disturbance rejection.
III. MAIN RESULTS
In this section, we will present two sliding mode control
strategies for the singularly perturbed system (1). The two
control methods share a similar procedure:
• A state feedback control law is designed to maintain the
fast or slow modes asymptotically stable.
• A discontinuous sliding mode control law for the re-
mainder modes is established to reject disturbances.
• The results are synthesized in a composite control law to
ensure the stability and robustness of the whole system.
Before proceeding to the main results, we need the fol-
lowing assumption.
Assumption 1: (A0, B0) and (A22, B2) are controllable,
where A0 = A11 −A12A−122 A21 and B0 = B1 −A−122 B2.
This assumption allows us to construct state feedback
control laws separately for the slow and fast subsystems
provided the original full-order system is controllable.
A. Dominating Slow Dynamics Approach
In this approach, a linear state feedback control law is
designed to place poles of the fast subsystem into appropriate
positions, and then a sliding mode control law is used for
the slow subsystem to exhibit the desired slow time sys-
tem performance. Although the original singularly perturbed
system can be decoupled into two time-scales and into two
lower dimensional state vectors, ξ(t) and z(t), the similar
type of decomposition does not hold for the control law and
the disturbance. As can be seen in the slow and the fast
subsystems, the control law u(t) is decomposed only in the
time scale, us(t) and uf (t), but not in its dimension. In
other words, both us(t) and uf (t) are still m-vectors as its
composite version u(t) = us(t) + uf (t). The same holds
for the disturbance f(t). Therefore, we allege that when it
comes to the subject of disturbance rejection, we can only
have one subsystem that enters the sliding mode unless an
appropriate dimensional decomposition in the control law
can be achieved.
With Assumption 1, a continuous fast-time state feedback
control law is available as
uf (t) = Kfz(t) (4)
such that A22 + B2Kf is asymptotically stable. The gain
matrix Kf can be chosen appropriately via the eigenvalue
placement technique since (A22, B2) is controllable. Then,
the system under the composite control law u(t) = us(t) +
uf (t) is defined as[
x˙(t)
z˙(t)
]
=
[
A11 (A12 +B1Kf )
A21 (A22 +B2Kf )
] [
x(t)
z(t)
]
+
[
B1
B2
]
(us(t) +Gf(t)). (5)
By the change of variables
ξ(t) = x(t)− M()z(t), (6)
the system (5) is transformed into a lower triangular form
(sensor form) [1][
ξ˙(t)
z˙(t)
]
=
[
As 0
A21 A22 +B2Kf + A21M
] [
ξ(t)
z(t)
]
+
[
Bs
B2
]
(us(t) +Gf(t)) (7)
where
As = A11 −MA21, (8)
Bs = B1 −MB2 (9)
and M is the solution to the following algebraic equation [1]
A12 +B1Kf −M(A22 +B2Kf )+A11M−MA21M = 0.
(10)
Matrix M can be found either using the fixed-point iterations
or the Newton method [20], [21].
We choose a sliding surface for the dominating slow
dynamics using the method of [22] as
ss(t) = Csξ(t) (11)
If m < n1, there exists a transformation Ts ∈ Rn1×n1 for
the slow subsystem of (7) such that [22]
TsBs =
[
0
Bs0
]
(12)
Under this transformation, the slow subsystem of (7) be-
comes [
ξ˙1(t)
ξ˙2(t)
]
=
[
As11 As12
As21 As22
] [
ξ1(t)
ξ2(t)
]
+
[
0
Bs0
]
(us(t) +Gf(t)) (13)
where [
ξ1(t)
ξ2(t)
]
= Tsξ(t).
The variable ξ2(t) should be regarded as a control input
to the dynamic equation of ξ1(t). According to [22], the
controllability of (As, Bs) implies the controllability of
(As11 , As12). As a result, we can find a gain matrix K1 such
that As11 −As12K1 is stable. Then, a sliding surface can be
chosen as
ss(t) = K1ξ1(t) + ξ2(t) = 0 (14)
Representing the sliding surface in ξ(t) coordinates, we
obtain
ss(t) = [K1 Im]Tsξ(t) = Csξ(t) = 0 (15)
renders matrix A0+B0Ks asymptotically stable. The system
under the control law u(t) = us(t) + uf (t) is described as[
x˙(t)
z˙(t)
]
=
[
A11 +B1Ks A12
A21 +B2Ks A22
] [
x(t)
z(t)
]
+
[
B1
B2
]
(uf (t) +Gf(t)). (29)
Introducing the change of variables
η(t) = z(t) + L()x(t) (30)
the system (29) is brought into the actuator form [1][
x˙(t)
η˙(t)
]
=
[
A11 +B1Ks −A12L A12
0 Af
] [
x(t)
η(t)
]
+
[
B1
Bf
]
(uf (t) +Gf(t)) (31)
where
Af = A22 + LA12 (32)
Bf = B2 + LB1 (33)
and L is the solution to the following algebraic equation [1]
A21+B2Ks−A22L+L(A11+B1Ks)−LA12L = 0. (34)
This equation can be solved using either the fixed-point
iterations or the Newton method [20]. Since L = A−122 (A21+
B2Ks) +O() [1], we have
A11 +B1Ks −A12L = A0 +B0Ks +O() (35)
Because A0 + B0K is asymptotically stable, there exists a
small ∗ > 0 such that for all  ∈ [0, ∗], A11+B1Ks−A12L
is asymptotically stable.
We are now in a position to construct a sliding mode con-
trol law for the fast subsystem in (31). Employing the same
technique as in the dominating slow dynamics approach, we
choose a sliding surface via the method of [22] as:
sf (t) = Cfη(t) (36)
If m < n2, there exists a transformation Tf ∈ Rn2×n2 for
the fast subsystem of (32) such that [22]
TfBf =
[
0
Bf0
]
. (37)
Under this transformation, the fast subsystem of (31) be-
comes [
η˙1(t)
η˙2(t)
]
=
[
Af11 Af12
Af21 Af22
] [
η1(t)
η2(t)
]
+
[
0
Bf0
]
(uf (t) +Gf(t)). (38)
Consider η2(t) as a control input to the dynamic equation of
η1(t). Since (Af21 , Af22) is controllable, we can find a gain
matrix K2 such that As21−As22K2 is asymptotically stable.
Then, a sliding surface can be chosen as
sf (t) = K2η1(t) + η2(t) = 0. (39)
Representing this sliding surface in the previous coordinates,
we obtain
sf (t) = [K2 Im]Tfη(t) = Cfη(t) = 0 (40)
where Cf = [K2 Im]Tf .
Taking the derivative of the sliding surface (40) with
respect to t, we have
s˙f (t) = CfAfη(t) + CfBfuf (t) + CfBfGf(t). (41)
With the assumption that the disturbance f(t) is bounded,
and Bf has full rank, a control law uf (t) can be chosen as
uf (t) = −(CfBf )−1[CfAfη(t)− S2sf (t)
+ (γ2 + σ2)
sf (t)
‖sf (t)‖ ] (42)
where γ2 = ‖CfBfG‖h, σ2 is a positive parameter, and
matrix S2 is asymptotically stable. The reaching condition
is satisfied since
sTf (t)s˙f (t) =−
1
2
sTf (t)P2sf (t)− σ2‖sf (t)‖ − γ2‖sf (t)‖
+ sTf CfBfGf(t) ≤ −σ2‖sf (t)‖ (43)
where
P2 = −ST2 − S2 > 0. (44)
Similar to Lemma 1 in the first approach, the following
lemma shows the interval of the reaching time.
Lemma 2:
2
λmax{P2} ln(
λmax{P2}
√
sT2 (0)s2(0) + 2σ2 + 4γ2
2σ2 + 4γ2
) ≤ τ2
≤ 2
λmin{P2} ln(
λmin{P2}
√
sT2 (0)s2(0) + 2σ2
2σ2
). (45)
The composite control law is described in terms of the
slow state feedback law and the fast sliding mode control
law as follows
u(t) =Ksx(t)− (CfBf )−1[CfAfη(t)− S2sf (t)
− (γ2 + σ2) sf (t)‖sf (t)‖ ]. (46)
In the original coordinates, the control law (46) is
u(t) = Ksx(t)− (CfBf )−1[CfAf (z(t) + Lx(t))
− S2Cf (z(t) + Lx(t))− (γ2 + σ2) Cf (z(t) + Lx(t))‖Cf (z(t) + Lx(t))‖ ].
(47)
The stability of the closed-loop system under the control
law (47) is proved in the following theorem.
Theorem 2: Assume (A,B) is controllable. Then there
exists ∗ > 0 such that in the sliding mode, the closed-loop
system is asymptotically stable for  ∈ (0, ∗] and invariant
to the external disturbance f(t).
Proof: Like Theorem 1, we employ the equivalent
control method to study the dynamics of the closed-loop
system. The equivalent control of the sliding motion of (39)
is defined by solving s˙f (t) = 0 as follows
ueqf (t) = −(CfBf )−1CfAfη(t)−Gf(t). (48)

Fig. 5. Evolution of the fast state variables for the dominating fast dynamics
approach
Simulation results of the dominating slow dynamics ap-
proach are shown in Fig. 1–3, while those of the dominating
fast dynamics approach are plotted in Fig. 4–6. Fig. 3 and
Fig. 6 show that the reaching time of the second approach
(0.001534s) is much faster that that of the first approach
(0.3545s). The impulse phenomena appear when a switching
action begins (Fig. 1, 2). The figures show that the impact of
the external disturbance is rejected in the sliding mode even
in the presence of the disturbance.
V. CONCLUSION

proposed methods share a common mechanism: the con-
tinuous state feedback and the discontinuous sliding mode
design. With the state feedback control ensuring the stability
for one set of (slow or fast) modes, the sliding mode
control is demonstrated to render the sliding mode such that
stability for the other modes can also be guaranteed and
that disturbance rejection for the entire system is achieved.
The two control laws are combined to construct a composite
control law. It has been shown that the closed-loop system
under the proposed approaches displays asymptotic stability
and robustness against external disturbances.
