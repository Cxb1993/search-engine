Valent Nanometals (4.14mg total, Fe:Ni=1:3) is an 
effective ratio for Cr(Ⅵ) solution.it was possible 
to achieve over a 99.7% reduction in 90min. 
Comparing the Cr(Ⅵ) removal efficiency of different 
methods,  we can find that extending the heating time 
of PAA solution, reducing Ni of bimetallic ratio, and 
reducing time of coating Ni solution can increase 
reductive degradation of Cr(Ⅵ).

中文摘要 
奈米零價金屬因具有反應迅速以及還原能力強的特性，能有效地去除水中污染物，
已被廣泛應用在水污染之整治上。惟金屬在奈米尺寸下，容易造成團聚效應，降低奈米
金屬在水中的去除效果。 
在本研究中，以聚偏二氟乙烯(PVDF)微濾膜做為奈米零價金屬之載體，藉由聚丙烯
酸溶液以交聯方式製備奈米零價金屬之複合膜。所製備兩種奈米零價金屬複合膜分別包
含奈米零價鐵之金屬複合膜及奈米零價鐵鎳之雙金屬複合膜，分別在控制不同pH值及不
同孔徑之金屬複合膜的條件下，探討其對水中Cr(Ⅵ)之去除效果；並以最佳孔徑之奈米
零價金屬複合膜，針對不同方式處理水中Cr(Ⅵ)，觀察其效果差異。同時，探討不同製
備方式對水中Cr(Ⅵ)去除效果及pH值變化之影響。 
研究結果發現，以含奈米零價鐵鎳之孔徑為0.45μm之雙金屬複合膜(雙金屬含量
4.14mg)處理Cr(Ⅵ)(起始濃度為20mg/L)效果最顯著，幾乎可以達到99.7%(90分鐘)，其中
鐵鎳雙金屬比例為1：3。 
此外，以不同方式處理水中Cr(Ⅵ)可以發現，奈米零價鐵鎳之雙金屬複合膜遠比奈
米金屬及PVDF微濾膜效果來的好。在探討不同方式製備奈米零價鐵鎳之雙金屬複合膜
時，以延長加熱時間、降低鎳之比例以及減少鎳浸漬時間時，均可增加對水中Cr(Ⅵ)之
去除效果。

Background and purposes – The nanoscale zero-valent metal (nZVM) containing properties 
of quick reaction and high reduction ability could remove efficiently the contaminations in 
water environment, which is widely used in current wastewater treatment process. However, 
the metal size at nanoscale is easily to form cluster effect that decrease its removal efficiency 
in water. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to coat dispersedly the nanoscale metal onto 
the supporting layer to prevent its cluster effect, and finally enhance the treatment efficiency. 
    In these three decades, the membrane technology increases dramatically. Many of their 
applications have resulted in excellent outcomes owing to problems free of second pollutions. 
Moreover, despite the traditional filtration process, many researchers have devoted their 
attentions to improve the material properties of membrane, as well as enhance the treatment 
efficiency. 
Because the PVDF membrane contains high resistance of chemical effect, free erosion 
under various conditions of acid, base, strong oxidant and halogen in room temperature, high 
pressure resistance and great mechanical strength, and higher chlorine resistance than PS 
membrane, it is used widely in producing MF and UF membranes. However, single material 
in making various types of membrane is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of membrane 
process in field applications. The surface modification of membrane is necessary to acquire 
needed properties to enhance the treatment efficiency. The membrane grafted polymer brushes 
is considered as an essential technique to modify the membrane surface, which includes the 
process of chemical oxidation, organic chemistry reaction, plasma treatment, graft, and 
crosslinking process (1). 
In recent years, zero-valent metal has widely used in the areas of pollutants removal, and 
has illustrated excellent efficiency in soil and groundwater remediation. However, the cluster 
effect of metallic particles under nanoscale was considered as a serious drawback in losing its 
advantage on surface effect of nanoparticles, which is also a major obstacle to overcome. 
Therefore, Bhattacharyya et al. indicated that hydrophilized PVDF MF membrane was used as 
the supporting layer. An aqueous coating solution was prepared by polyacrylic acid (PAA)

Figure. 4.  
Under different process in making Fe/Ni bimetallic NPs membrane, the efficiency of 
Cr(VI) removal was improved by extending heating time, and lowering the Ni/Fe ratio and 
soaking time, shown as Figure. 5. 
Based on the relationship of difference of total Cr and difference of Cr(VI) before and 
after treatment from the analysis of reacted liquid phase, the Cr(VI) removal mechanism for 
Fe0 NPs membrane at polar size equal to 0.22μm、0.45μm、0.65μm was confirmed as  
adsorption reaction, where the mechanism for Fe0/Ni0 NPs membrane at the polar size equal to 
0.10μm、0.45μm and 0.65μm was confirmed as reduction reaction, shown as Table 1.
