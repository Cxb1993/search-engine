11. Introduction
Peito Hot Spring has been a famous scenic area since early twentieth century not only because of
its hot spring but also the discovery of hokutolite (Chang, 1961; Huang, 2005). Hokutolite, which is
also called as Peito stone, was discovered in Peito Creek near Hokuto (Japanese name) Hot Spring in
Taiwan by Yohachiro Okamoto in 1905 (Chang, 1961). Today, Hokuto is called as Peito (or Beitou). In
1912, Hayakawa and Nakano named the Peito stone as anglesobarite (Hayakawa and Nakano, 1912).
Later on the meeting held by International Mineralogical Association in 1913, the Peito stone was
renamed by Jimbo as hokutolite (Spencer, 1916), which is the only one among more than 4000 known
minerals in the world to be named after a place in Taiwan and has been regarded even more precious
than gold. The primary chemical composition of hokutolite is plumbian barite, (Ba, Pb)SO4, which
crystallizes in minute rhombic platy crystals on andesite with a yellowish gray or brown color and a
resinous luster (Weng, 1991). Hokutolite is famous for its radioactivity, which originates from radium
and thorium precipitating from hot spring water (Chen et al., 2005). Therefore, the chemical
environment of the hot spring water is critical for the formation of hokutolite. Many tourists visited
this area for sight-seeing and boiling eggs customarily in the hot spring pond called Geothermal Valley.
Nevertheless, owing to improper management of environment, hokutolite was collected illegally
before 1997. Besides, several SPA hotels were built up successively along Peito Creek (Fig. 1) since
1960s. Proprietors of SPA hotels along with local inhabitants drill wells and channel spring water from
underground reservoir of geothermal water and discharge waste water into the creek. Considering the
development of tourism in this area, the environmental change due to human activities was ignored
and the ecology of Peito Creek has been destroyed seriously. Not until the appeals from some local
environmental groups to the government did the reconstruction of this district to recover hokutolite
start in 1997. The collected hokutolites were conserved and exhibited in Peito Hot Spring Museum
opened on October 11, 1998. However, spring water channeling and waste water discharge are still
proceeding. This could affect the chemical environment as well as activity ratios in the hot spring
water and decrease the effect of recovering hokutolite.
The stratum (Wuzhi Mountain layer) of Peito Hot Spring Area is principally andesite and basalt
32. Experimental
2.1 Sample collection
All samples were collected along the Peito Creek and in the Geothermal Valley of the Peito Hot
Spring Area in 2006 (Fig. 1). Geothermal water samples were collected from 12 different locations,
including 4 sites in the Geothermal Valley and others along the Peito Creek, in 20 L of polyethylene
containers. Several SPA hotels distribute along the Peito Creek (Fig. 1) and their waste water is
discharged into the creek. The sample codes W1/S1–W4/S4 specify water/sediment samples collected
from the sampling sites located in Geothermal Valley, where spring water channeling or waste water
discharge is inhibited. Other sample codes, W5–W12, indicated water samples obtained from upstream
to downstream Peito Creek and were chosen close to main discharge points. Among them, the range of
hokutolite discovered was mainly between W6 and W10 (Chang, 1961). Mud sediment (abbreviated to
sediment in this study) was spread principally in Geothermal Valley while gravels were distributed in
Peito Creek. The sediment samples were collected from 10 cm deep mud at S1-S4 by a shovel.
2.2 Reagents and apparatus
Acids including 65% HNO3, 37% HCl and 48% HF purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany)
were of Suprapur® grade, which were used for sample digestion, column cleaning, conditioning and
cation exchange separations. The Ultrapur® grade (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) of nitric acid was
used in serial dilution of standard solution for quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometer (ICP-QMS) analysis. Ultra-pure water obtained from a Milli-Q Gradient (18 MΩ)water
purifier (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was used for dilution throughout this study.
As for the determination of 226Ra in sediment, insoluble matters remained in the solution was
removed by vacuum filtration with a 50 mL conical polysulfone filter fitted in a filtering funnel
(Gelman science, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, No.4204) and a glass microfiber filter (Whatman International
Ltd., England). The inside wall of the chimney was kept free of scratches and abrasions to drain the
filtered solution smoothly and completely.
5following gamma-spectrum analysis.
A stock solution of 67.08 μg/L (2482 Bq kg−1) of 226Ra standard in 1M HCl (SRM 4967A) was
purchased from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
to determine 226Ra concentration in the digested sediment samples. Working standard solutions at
pg~fg mL−1 level were prepared by gravimetrically serial dilution from the standard reference material.
Bio-Rad AG 50W-X12 (200-400 mesh) resin was used in the cation exchange to separate 226Ra, which
was washed with ultra-pure water to remove very fine particles (Hodge and Laing, 1994) and
preconditioned with 0.3 M HCl before use. A NIST-traceable 133Ba source was utilized to evaluate the
chemical yield. The 226Ra concentration in the digested sediment samples was then determined with an
ICP-QMS.
Water samples
After filtration, one liter of the collected samples was transferred to Marinelli beakers and sealed
for four weeks to ensure a secular equilibrium between radium and their daughters of U and Th series.
The weighted mean of 228Ac measured by its full energy absorption peaks at 911.07 and 969.11 keV
was applied to estimate the activity of 228Ra (Ribeiro et al., 2001).
Uranium and thorium isotopes in the geothermal water were separated with U/TEVA and TEVA
resins respectively and determined using a semiconducting surface barrier detector (Canberra model
7200-06) as described in our previous study (Tsai et al., 2008).
After separated with Bio-Rad AG 50W-X12 (200-400 mesh) resin, the 226Ra concentration in water
was determined with an ICP-QMS. The chemical recovery was estimated by a 133Ba standard source.
2.5 Instrumentation
ICP-QMS
The ICP-QMS used in this work was Thermo X series II (Thermo, Bremen, Germany) with Xs-
interface a new ion extraction system with low background noise less than 0.5 counts per second. The
Xs- interface, was designed to offer enhanced sensitivity for ultratrace analytes with masses above 80
7Teflon PFA and an Ultem polyetherimide outer shell. A cap (Autovent Plus) was used to release the
excessive pressure in the vessel, which was immediately resealed to prevent loss of sample and
volatile analytes.
Gamma spectrometer
A gamma spectrometer and related accessories were supplied by Canberra, U.S.A. Each sample
was analyzed using a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (GC3020). The efficiency of the
detector is 20% relative to 3 in. × 3 in. NaI(Tl). Detailed information about the source, density, matrix,
efficiency as well as geometry and dimension of the glass ampoule were established for gamma
spectrum analysis.
9dissolution of PbCl2 by complexation [Eq. (2); logKf=-0.1, Harvey, 2000]. Therefore, plumbian barite
precipitates as a film on andesite was seldom observed between W1-W6. As the water flows
downstream, the solubility of PbSO4, PbCl2 and BaSO4 lowers with decreasing temperature in water.
When the temperature decreases to about 60 , where the solubility product of BaSO℃ 4 starts to drop
(Langmuir and Riese, 1985), the coprecipitation of Pb2+, Ba2+, Ra2+ with SO42+ (Chao et al.,, 2009) as
well as the adsorption of plumbian barite on jarosite [K2Fe6(OH)12(SO4)4] for crystal growth of
hokutolite is enhanced. This accounts for the reason why hokutolite was discovered at downstream
Peito Creek rather than the springhead in Geothermal Valley.

Moreover, solubility product of BaSO4 (1.1ⅹ10-10, at 25 ) is smaller than that of PbSO℃ 4 (1.6ⅹ10-8,
at 25 )℃ and PbCl2 (1.7ⅹ10-5, at 25 ). This demonstrates that the precipitation of Ba is℃ preferential to
that of Pb when temperature declines, resulting in a predictable decrease of concentration ratio of Ba
to Pb, [Ba]/[Pb], in water from source of the hot spring toward downstream Peito Creek. Furthermore,
higher amount of Ba than Pb was observed in Hoktolite discovered from Peito (Momoshima et al.,
1997; Yamamoto et al., 2005). As plotted in Fig. 3, the concentration of Pb in geothermal water indeed
varies apparently against sampling sites and drops from W6 toward W12, where the temperature also
begins to decrease [Fig. 2(B)]. Nevertheless, the concentration of Ba varies slightly. This causes the
[Ba]/[Pb] ratios (Fig. 3) to vary inversely with predicted trend against sampling sites. Additionally, the
[Ba]/[Pb] ratio increases with decreasing temperature (Fig. 2 and 3), suggesting that temperature is
critical for the proportion of Ba to Pb (Sasaki and Minato, 1982). The inverse trend of [Ba]/[Pb] ratios
against sampling sites have implied evident effect of human activities on water environment of the
studied area. In resent years, geothermal water channeled from subterranean reservoir is mixed with
tap water by neighboring SPA hotels and inhabitants for hot spring bath. In addition to lowering
temperature, the discharge of the waste water also infuses organic compounds [according to the total
organic carbon (TOC); Table 1] into the creek and dilutes the concentration of major ions originally
11
decline with pH; however, the acidity reveals greater effect on solubility of Th than U in water [Fig.
5(A)]. Fig. 5(B) represents that U and Th concentrations increase with redox potential while the redox
state exhibits greater influence on solubility of Th than U. Concentration of U and Th is correlated to
that of Cl- and SO42- ions in good linearity as illustrated respectively in Fig. 5 (C) and (D), which show
that both U and Th concentrations increase with Cl- and SO42- concentrations yet the effect of major
anion concentrations is greater on Th than on U according to the slopes in Fig. 5 (C) and (D). The
results may be attributed to complexation of U and Th with Cl- and SO42- ions [e.g., UO2Cl+
(logKf=0.24), UO2(SO4)22- (logKf=4.25), ThCl3+ (logKf=1.12), ThCl3+ (logKf=4.25), ThSO42+
(logKf=5.47), Th(SO4)32- (logKf=10.54) and Th(SO4)44- (logKf=8.51); Kf denotes the formation
constant calculated from Gibbs free energy of UO2+, Th4+, Cl- and SO42- under the standard condition]
(Langmuir, 1978; Langmuir and Herman, 1980; Lin, 2003). From Table 1, the concentration ratio of
Th/U can be estimated (not plotted here), which lowers abruptly with both Cl- and SO42-
concentrations and varies slightly at higher concentration of major anions (≥1500 ppm) due to soluble
complexes of U formed with major anions.
3.2.2 Activity concentration (AC) and activity ratios (ARs) for radionuclides of U-series
The AC of 238U and 234U in water is 3.45±0.70–99.7±4.9 mBq/L and 3.59±0.72–97.8±4.8 mBq/L
[Fig. 6 (A) and (B)] respectively. Both 238U and 234U concentrations in water declines from upstream
to downstream Peito Creek. As for the sediment, the AC of 238U and 234U is 32.6±2.8–53.8±1.9 Bq/kg
and 37.5±3.0–56.2±2.0 Bq/kg [Fig. 6 (A) and (B)], respectively. The AC of 230Th is
2.77±0.98–32.0±2.1 mBq/L in water and 20.8±1.7–44.2±4.9 Bq/kg in sediment as illustrated in Fig. 6
(C). 226Ra concentration ranges from 6.17±0.52 to 55.1±2.2 mBq/L in water and 226.1±14.5 to
389.3±18.0 Bq/kg in sediment [Fig. 6 (D)]. Obviously, the ACs of 226Ra in sediment are much higher
than those of its parent nuclides. Radium concentration in natural waters is limited either by adsorption
or/and by formation of solid solution. The adsorption of radium is inhibited by low pH and high
concentrations of divalent metallic ions, because H+, Ca2+, Sr2+ Ba2+ and Pb2+ may compete with Ra
during adsorption process (Grund and Cape, 2006; Riese, 1982). Besides, higher ionic strength may
13
slightly, while the AC of 232Th in sediment varies similar to the trend of Cl- and SO42- concentrations
against sampling sites [Fig. 2(C)]. This indicates that the solubility of 232Th is affected by Cl- and SO42-
ions possibly via complex formation at low pH (LangmuirLanmuir, 1978; Lin et al., 2003). On the
other hand, in Peito Creek, 232Th concentration declines from upstream toward downstream region
(W5-W12) similar to the trend of conductivity in Fig. 2(A) yet inverse with that of pH [Fig. 2(B)]. The
result reveals the effect of pH and conductivity (as well as ionic strength) on the solubility of thorium.
228Ra is more abundant than the parent, 232Th, both in water (222.2±15.2–388.2±31.3 mBq/L) and in
sediment (1320±4–4330±9 Bq/kg) [Fig. 8(B)]. 228Ra in water decreases gradually from W1 to W12,
which is attributed to the decrease of acidity and ionic strength as well as the precipitation of radium
with sulfate [Fig.2 and 8(B)] when temperture decreases. In Geothermal Valley, the lower pH enhances
acid leaching, and stronger ionic strength increases the dissolution of radium. However, at Peito Creek,
the above aquatic parameters decrease. Additionally, artificial mixing of tap water with channeled
spring water may result in temperature decrease and precipitation of cations and anions inside the
pipelines (Chang et al., 2005). This lowers Ra2+ concentration as well as ionic strength, wherefore the
AC of 228Ra declines in water. The AC relationship between 228Ra and 226Ra is not significantly linear
either in water (R2=0.6585) or in sediment (R2=0.6744); however, the AC of 228Ra tends to increase
proportionally to that of 226Ra. Furthermore, the ARs of 228Ra/226Ra in water (5.96±0.53–38.37±6.33)
are similar to those investigated by Momoshima recently (Momoshima et al., 2005).
The AC of 228Th in water ranges between 16.0±2.4 and 342.5±6.8 mBq/L, which exhibits similar
decline trend to 232Th AC against sampling sites in water [Fig. 8(C)]. In sediment, 228Th content ranges
between 801.4±14.7 and 2760±20 Bq/kg, while no apparent tendency was found against the sampling
sites. In the studied area, the ACs of Th-series nuclides are higher than that of U-series, which is
consistent with the observation of background radiation in this area (Chen, 2005).
ARs of 228Ra/232Th are 9.86±1.04–106.8±44.3 in water and 31.73±2.82–171.2±12.9 in sediment
(Fig. 9), revealing evident disequilibrium in radioactivity. With increasing Cl- concentration, the
228Ra/232Th AR in water decreases obviously due to complexation of Th with Cl- ions, which increase
the solubility of thorium [Fig. 5(C) and Fig. 9(A)]. On the other hand, the 228Ra/232Th ARs in water
15
decay successively into 234U (route A1) withα-recoil energy transfer and or be dissolved in water with
a uranyl form (route A2) especially in an acidic and oxidizing environment. Another uranyl species,
234UO22+, may be obtained from decay of 238UO22+ (route B) or dissolution of 234U in water via
autoxidation and electron stripping (route C1). The 234U in sediment and in water (in 234UO22+ form)
may decay directly into 230Th via route C2 and D, respectively. An equilibrium of
precipitation/dissolution for 230Th between water and the rocksediment (or sedimentrock) can be
established (route E2), which may be determined by pH, Eh or concentrations of Cl- and SO42- ions.
230Th in water may further decay into 226Ra (route E1). In sediment, the 226Ra can be dissolved into
water in the environment of low pH and high ionic strength (route G). The dissolved 226Ra in water
may be coprecipitated with plumbian barite (route H) when the acidity and ionic strength decrease,
which is followed by adsorbing on jarosite (route I1) as hokutolite. The coprecipitate [(Ra,Ba,Pb)SO4]
of 226Ra with (Ba,Pb)SO4 may also subside directly into the sediment as shown in route I2. On the
other hand, the primordial nuclide, 232Th, of Th-series in sediment undergoes radioactive decay into
228Ra with α-recoil energy transfer (route J). 228Ra may dacay successively into 228Th (route K1) or
become soluble in water at places with high acidity and ionic strength (route K2). The dissolved 228Ra
may further decay into 228Th (route L2) or be coprecipitated with plumbian barite as acidity and ionic
strength decrease (route L1). In addition, the (228Ra,Ba,Pb)SO4 coprecipitate may be adsorbed on
jarosite (route M1) in the formation of hokutolite or subside directly into the sediment (route M2)
similar to the processes of route I1 and I2 in U-series. The migration of the decayed 228Th between
water and sediment depends on its solubility determined by aquatic parameters (e.g., pH, Eh as well as
Cl- and SO42- concentration) of the environment (route N).
17
A novel mechanism was proposed in this study to describe the processes and reactions underwent
in Peito Hot Spring Area, which could be applied in the investigation for radiochemistry and migration
of U/Th-series nuclides as well as the formation and conservation of hokutolite.
