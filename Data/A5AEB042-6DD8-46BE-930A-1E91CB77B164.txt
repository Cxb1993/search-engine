 1. Introduction 
Engineering practice has long been concerned with the propagation and transformation of 
short-waves in shallow waters. In general, theory of numerical simulations of short shallow water 
waves are based either on the shallow-water equations (SWE) or Boussinesq equations (BE). SWE 
is derived from mass and momentum conservation with the assumption of incompressiblity, 
hydrostatic pressure distribution, and a sufficiently smooth bottom slope. The resulting waves are 
non-dispersive, while waves of finite amplitude cannot propagate without change of shape, 
therefore, are restricted to very shallow waters [1, 20]. BE takes into account the effect of vertical 
accelerations on the pressure distribution. The resulting waves are dispersive, and can be applied  
to a much wider wave spectrum and a large part of region [25, 26, 28, 29]. With appropriate balance 
between nonlinearity and dispersion, Korteg-de Vries (KdV) equation can be derived for a 
horizontal bottom [20]. It is often used to model the solitary wave whose wave profile propagates at 
constant speed and remains permanent. 
The depth-averaged, 2D SWE has wide range applications in ocean, environmental and hydraulic 
engineering, such as, tidal flows in estuary and coastal regions, and open-channel flows in rivers 
and reservoirs. SWE is a system of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws that admits sharp 
gradient solutions like shock waves and expansion fans. Extensive research has been performed in 
the area of SWE, and several upwind schemes originally designed to solve the Euler equations have 
been extended to the SWE. Some examples are the Roe’s method [5], the Beam-Warming scheme, 
the monotonic upstream schemes for the conservation laws (MUSCL), the Osher and Salmon, the 
essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) schemes [36, 37], as well as the Harten, Lax and van Leer (HLL) 
solver. Most of these methods determine the flux vector based on the wave propagation structure, 
therefore, have the ability of shock capturing with a high level of accuracy [23, 33]. 
Many upwind schemes have been applied successfully for flows in channels. However, their 
applications to river flows are not so common in the literature and their adoption to river hydraulics 
is hindered by the irregular topography and bathymetry. The presence of extreme slopes, high 
roughness and strong changes in the irregular geometry represent a difficulty that can lead to 
important numerical errors presumably arising from the source terms of the equations [8]. 
Conservation laws with source terms often have steady-state in which flux gradients are nonzero 
but exactly balanced by source terms [23]. Many numerical methods (e.g., fractional step methods) 
have difficulty to preserve such steady-state (the C-property) and cannot accurately calculate small 
perturbations of such states. Numerical solution of SWE with source terms faces problem that 
low-accuracy solvers yield quite inaccurate solutions, in particular large errors for the wave speed 
[1]. LeVeque [24] developed a treatment for the bed slope source terms which balanced the source 
terms and flux gradients. This method is suitable for quasi-steady problems, but is reported to be 
less successful when applied to calculate steady transcritical flow with a shock. Zhou, et al [38] 
proposed the surface gradient method (SGM) for treating source terms in SWE. This method works 
well for flows with small and mild changes, and experiences difficulty to maintain the conservation 
property and exhibits numerical oscillations for flows with large changes [31]. 
Research on methods of solution of the SWE has received considerable attention in the past three 
decades. There are many computational methods for SWE, such as the finite-difference methods [1], 
finite-volume methods [4, 8, 24], finite-element methods [11, 15, 17], Godunov-type method [3, 13], 
and lattice Boltzmann method [39]. 
Unstructured meshes are attractive because of their flexibility for representing irregular 
boundaries and local mesh refinement. Least-squares finite-element method (LSFEM) 
forapproximating the solution of boundary value problems of partial differential equations has been 
studied at least three decades [20, 22, 28]. In recent years, LSFEMS have been receiving increasing 
attention in both engineering and mathematics communities. In the engineering literature, for 
solving Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations by LSFEMs, the L2 LSFEMs are the most popular one

The least-squares functional and its minimization principle are then constructed. For , we 
use the standard notation and definition for the Sobolev spaces 
0s ≥
( )sH Ω  and ( )sH Γ  with the 
corresponding inner products denoted by ( ) ,.,. s Ω  and ( ) ,.,. s Γ , and norms by ,. s Ω   and ,. s Γ , 
respectively. Whenever there is no ambiguity, measures Ω  and Γ  will be omitted from inner 
product and norm designations. We denote the inner products ( )2L Ω  and ( )2L Γ  by ( )H Ω  and 
( )H Γ , respectively. The L2 least-squares functional associated with the SWE, Eq. (5) and (10), is

 Three cases are considered: the weak shock ( 1Lh =  and 0.5Rh = ; /L Rh h  = 2) , mild shock ( 1Lh =  
and ; 0.1Rh = /L Rh h  = 10), and strong shock ( 1Lh =  and 0.02Rh = ; /L Rh h  = 50). In all cases, a 
shock wave moving right and a rarefaction fan extending left are generated after the instantaneous 
collapse of the dam. 
A 200 x 2 uniform four-node quadrilateral elements ( 1 x y mΔ = Δ = ) and  are used for 
computing. Though the problem is solved with two-dimensional setting, computed results respect 
the one dimensionality of the physical problem. Comparison of computed results with the analytic 
solution [
0.1 tΔ = s
34] at t = 20 s is shown in Figure 1. The traveling to right shock and rarefaction wave to 
left are well captured without adopting the upwind scheme in weak shock case. However, agreement 
in mild and strong shock cases, in term of the shock strength and shock speed, is poor. Table 1 
summaries the comparison of computed shock speed, shock height, velocity and height at the dam 
with the exact solution. Mesh refinement, depicted in Figure 2, does not improve the accuracy of the 
approximations. This observation confirms that non-conservative form based primitive schemes 
lead to incorrect solution in the presence of shocks, but are perfectly adequate for smooth flow and 
for linear discontinuities such as vortices, shear waves and contact discontinuities [18]. 
4.1.2 2D Circular dam break 
An ideal circular dam break is considered [34]. The dam is assumed to be enclosed by an infinitely 
thin circular wall of radius R = 2.5 m in a square computational domain of 40 m x 40 m with the 
center ( ) ( ), 20 ,20 c cx y m= m

The circular dam wall is assumed to collapse instantaneously. 
 Figure 4(a) depicts the computational meshes (60,788 nodes and 121,062 three-node triangle 
elements) used. Finer meshes are used near the center region, where flow field with sharp gradients 
are expected, shown in Figure 4(b).  is used in the computations. Figure 5 shows the 
comparison of computed water surface at various time instances with the results of Toro [
0.02 tΔ =
34]. At 
time t = 0.4 s, Figure 5(a1), an outward-propagating circular shock wave and an inward-propagating 
rarefaction wave are well captured. Sharp gradient of water depth in front of shock is observed. At 
time t = 0.7 s, Figure 5(a2), the circular rarefaction wave has imploded into the center and been 
reflected, resulting a very pronounced fall of the water surface elevation in the vicinity of the center. 
Figure 5(a3) displays the water surface at t = 1.4 s. The reflected inner circular rarefaction wave has 
over-expanded the flow to the point that water surface has fallen well below the ambient depth 
initially outside the circular dam (h = 0.5 m); Figure 5(a4) shows the bottom view of the same result. 
The water depth is very close to zero and a secondary circular shock has formed. 
Figures 5(a5) and (a6) show the top and bottom view of water surface at t = 3.5 s, respectively. 
The primary shock has propagated further away from the center and the secondary shock has 
propagated toward the center. Figures 5(a7) and (a8) show the top and bottom view of water surface 
at t = 4.7 s, respectively, shortly after the secondary shock has imploded into the center. This shock 
has reflected from the center and is now propagating outward.  
Time history of water surface at r = 0 m is compared with the result of Toro [34] and illustrated 
in Figure 6. The main features seen at the center are the strong rarefaction wave reaching the center 
and the imploded secondary shock wave at time about t = 4.25 s. Overall, the predictions of present 
study agree well with the numerical results of Toro [34].

4.2.3 Steady transcritical flow with a shock over a bump 
This problem is a similar problem as previous one, except the upstream boundary condition is Q =

4.2.4 2D test for the source terms of bottom effects 
2D formulation with the effects of the bottom topography using a test widely used in the literature 
[24, 36, 37] is examined. The computational domain is [0, 2] x [0, 1], and the bottom topography,

simulation. First, we consider simulation with the flow at rest initially. We found the exact 
C-property is respected for a long period of simulation. Then we consider the initial condition with

Figure 12 shows comparison of the computed water surface of the present study with the numerical 
result, with the same mesh, of Akoh, et al. [2]. A 30 uniformly spaced contour lines of water surface 
level h at t = 0.12, 0.24, 0.36, 0.48, and 6.0 s, respectively, are depicted. The initial perturbation 
propagates and exits the left boundary with unnoticeable reflection; propagates right and is affected 
by the bottom. Shoaling effect (increasing the amplitude of wave due to the decreasing of water 
depth) is obvious at t = 0.24 s. The wave speed is slower above the hump than elsewhere, leading to 
a distortion of the initially planar perturbation. Reflections and interactions of the surface wave 
result in complex and symmetrical structures. It is observed that the 2D scheme exactly simulate the 
symmetrical structure with the fine structures well resolved. Overall, predictions of the present 
study agree well with the numerical results of Akoh, et al. [2, 24]. 
5 Conclusion 
A  2D non-conservative shallow-water equations model based on the least-squares finite-element 
formulation and  θ −method time integration is presented. It can handle complex topography and 
bed variations (source terms) easily without any special treatment, steady and unsteady, and
