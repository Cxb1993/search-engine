line. An equivalent circuit of the proposed 
lowpass filter is simply represented by RLC 
lumped elements. According to measured results, 
compared with a conventional H-slot resonator, 
the resonance frequency of the resonator is 
reduced from 3.5 GHz to 2.0 GHz and the ratio 
of frequency reduction is about 43 %.  The 
measured insertion loss at a passband is below 
0.3 dB, and the rejection band over 25 dB is 
from 1.95 to 9.0 GHz. 
In the second part, a design procedure for a 
wideband planar unidirectional antenna is 
presented based on the monopole slot antenna. 
Owing to the additional capacitance contributed 
by a stub-protruded feedline and two 
symmetrical stubs at the slot edge, the 
impedance-matching condition is improved; 
meanwhile, the resonance frequency of the 
monopole slot antenna is significantly shifted 
down, and an improvement in impedance 
bandwidth is achieved. By modifying the width 
of the ground plane, connecting one metallic 
finger at the upper right corner, and etching two 
asymmetrical slits in the ground plane as 
reflectors, the radiation directivity of the 
monopole slot antenna can be enhanced. The 
proposed antenna achieves a measured 97.4 % 
bandwidth for S11 < -10 dB at the center 
frequency of 2.31 GHz, better than 10 dB 
front-to-back ratio. 
 
一、COMPACT FILTER 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Compact-size lowpass filters (LPF) are 
frequently required in some communication 
systems to suppress harmonics and spurious 
signals. A transmission line incorporating a 
patterned ground plane, in which slots or holes 
are etched, achieves band-rejection 
characteristics. Recently, usage of the 
slotted-ground-plane resonator in the lowpass 
filter for wide stopband performance has been 
demonstrated [1-6]. By cascading several 
equilateral resonator units, a lowpass filter with 
wide stopband can be designed. The units offer a 
finite-transmission-zero characteristics and the 
transmission zeros are used to suppress the 
spurious response of the lowpass filter. A 
coupled-line bandpass filter with two 
dumbbell-shaped slots on a ground plane is 
shown in [1]. Couple-line sections and patterned 
slots can be transformed to J-inverters and 
provide transmission zeros at some frequencies. 
Due to the transmission zeros in the upper 
stopband, a conventional bandpass filter 
achieves frequency characteristics of a lowpass 
filter. Effects of different geometrical shapes of a 
slot in the ground plane on performance of a 
microstrip lowpass filter are studied in [2-6], 
especially sharpness of transition and stopband 
rejection. The position of the slots is also a 
critical parameter of the design of the compact 
and better LPF. In [3], a low-characteristic- 
impedance transmission line is placed on the top 
of the slotted ground plane. The line has a 
capacitive element equivalently. Three 
dumbbell-shaped slots of different size are 
serially etched in the ground plane and provide 
three series inductor. A separation between two 
neighboring slots would result in a required 
capacitive element.  Two shapes of a slot, 
including a dumbbell and spiral structures, are 
serially etched in the ground plane in order to 
demonstrate an quasi-elliptic LPF [7]. The 
dumbbell-shaped slot provides wideband 
attenuation in a stopband. The spiral-shaped slot

B. Stepped-Impedance Open Stub 
An open-circuited shunt stub connected to a 
50-Ω microstrip line can be treated as a 
transmission zero over a wide frequency range. 
For a length (p) of the stub, the locations of the 
transmission zeros are determined by an odd 
multiple of λg/4, where λg is the guided 
wavelength in microstrip structure. The rejection 
frequency ( f ) corresponding to the geometric 
dimension is shown by

resonance number. An open-circuited 
stepped-impedance resonator is shown in Fig. 3. 
A frequency shift of the first transmission zero is 
achieved by replacing the quarter-wave 
transmission line by a stepped-impedance 
structure. It is noted that the length of the stub is 
unchanged. The lengths of the section lines of 
the two SI open-ended stubs are set by d, so p is 
equal to 2d. The input impedance (Zi) of the stub 
is shown by

and 5.8 GHz, are merged and the band-rejection 
characteristics are enhanced.  From this figure, 
one clearly observes that a transmission zero at 
about 2.1 GHz is introduced to the frequency 
response. This transmission zero makes the 
bandstop filter into the lowpass filter with the 
sharp transition knee. Furthermore, the operated 
frequency of the lowpass filter shifts down as 
decreasing the separation S1. In order to improve 
the S21-magnitude at the upper edge of the 
transmission zero around 2.1 GHz, S1 is selected 
by 3 mm. Fig. 7 is the simulated S21-parameters

 二、ANTENNA MODULE 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
Owing to planar geometry, wide impedance 
bandwidth and simple structure, the monopole 
slot antenna receives much attention in the field 
of wireless communication systems. A 
quarter-wavelength open slot cut in the finite 
ground plane and fed by a microstrip 
transmission line, a wide impedance bandwidth 
and bi-directional radiation are provided [13]. 
Several different slot shapes were introduced to 
generate additional resonances so that bandwidth 
enhancement was achieved [14]. Furthermore, 
the occupied area of the antenna was decreased. 
In [15], a pentagon-shape slot was etched as a 
radiator on the ground plane, and a feeding line 
with a pentagon stub was used. This antenna 
demonstrates a superior ultra-wideband (UWB) 
impedance bandwidth. A multiband monopole 
slot antenna utilized in wireless wide area 
network (WWAN) application was studied in 
[16]. By using a step-shaped microstrip feedline 
to electromagnetically couple the power into 
three monopole slots, three resonant modes were 
excited. The proposed antenna is promising as 
an internal antenna in the thin-profile laptop 
computer. Due to the monopole topology [17], 
co-polarized radiation patterns of the monopole 
slot antenna at different frequencies look 
omni-directional. By placing a back metal plate 
as a power reflector below a printed open-slot 
antenna, a back-lobe level was reduced and 
unidirectional radiation characteristics in free 
space were achieved [18].  
 
2.  ANTENNA DESIGN 
Fig. 13 shows the schematic configuration 
of the unidirectional monopole slot antenna with 
the F/B ratio of up to 10 dB over the operated 
bands. The design parameters of the proposed 
antenna after the optimization process are listed 
in Table I. FR-4 is used as a substrate with the 
dielectric constant of 4.4 and the thickness of 0.8 
mm, respectively.  
The proposed antenna is composed of a 
  10
comparison of simulated reflection coefficients 
(S11) of the three cases of the monopole 
rectangular-slot antenna, which are the 
conventional monopole slot antenna with a 
uniform feedline one with a stub-protruded 
feedline and the other with a protruded feedline 
and two stubs at the slot edge. Due to the 
protruding element at the end of the feeding line,  
the coupling between the feedline and the slot

current density on the ground plane for the

edge increases, resulting in frequency reduction 
of the lower resonance so that the impedance 
bandwidth effectively increases. Similar to the 
technique of adding a parasitic capacitance at the 
feedline [20], this capacitance is a capacitive 
loading to the slot for canceling the inductive 
reactance of the slot at lower frequency. Hence, 
the lower resonance is shifted down and the 
bandwidth increases. After adding the stubs at 
the slot edge, an internal capacitance is formed 
due to a voltage difference between the two 
identical stubs. The impedance-matching 
condition at the middle frequency band (about at 
3.0 GHz) is improved. By utilizing these two 
techniques, the impedance bandwidth increases 
from 52 % (2.40 – 4.09 GHz) to 81 % (1.68 – 
3.97 GHz) and the lower frequency band is 
shifted down. In other words, the antenna size 
can be reduced. 
The distributions of the simulated surface 
current density on the ground plane for two 
cases at 1.8 GHz, including Gx2 = 35 mm and 
Gx2 = 60 mm, are shown in Fig. 15(a) and (b). 
The injected power is coupled into the open-slot 
and radiates into space in the form of space wave 
and surface wave. The space wave is a 
standing-wave mode and radiates out in the 
broadside direction, which locates at the z-axis 
(Fig. 13). The surface wave is a traveling-wave 
mode. For the monopole slot antenna, the power 
leaks out mainly through the surface wave. The 
surface wave flows along the edges of the 
open-slot and radiates out in the -y-axis direction, 
positioned at Φ = 270o and θ = 90o. At the open 
end of the slot, some of the residual power flows 
out along the x-axial edges of the ground plane.  
It is observed that, for the case of Gx2 = 35 mm, 
  12
finger stub operated from 1.7 GHz to 3.8 GHz. 
After adding the finger stub at the ground plane, 
the F/B ratios apparently improve, especially at 
the middle and high frequency bands. 
Figs. 18 and 19 provide the comparisons of 
the reflection coefficients and the 3.0-GHz 
radiation patterns of three monopole slot 
antennas without and with two types of slits. The 
effect of embedding the two slits in the ground 
plane is apparent on its impedance bandwidth. It 
is observed that, when the lower slit is rippled,

the bottom-sided power is effectively suppressed 
and the back-lobes at 3.0 GHz are reduced. Fig. 
15(b) and (c) show the distributions of the 
surface current density on the ground plane 
without and with the embedded slits. Part of the  
surface  currents  at  the  y-axial  edges  
of  the ground plane leads to  the x-axial  
slits,  and then the direction of the original back 
radiation is changed from the y-axis to the x-axis; 
hence, the  back-lobe at Φ = 90o and θ = 90o is  
suppressed.  The results of the simulated F/B 
ratios from 1.7 GHz to 3.8 GHz are shown in Fig. 
20. When the slits are embedded, the F/B ratios 
around 1.7 GHz and 3.3 GHz increase 
significantly.

radiating antennas, such as the Yagi-Uda 
antenna. Fig. 23 presents the simulated 
maximum gain and radiation efficiency proposed 
monopole slot antennas. For most of the 
operated of the conventional and frequencies, the 
maximum gain of the proposed antenna is higher 
than that of the conventional antenna. The 
lowering of radiation efficiency of the proposed 
antenna at high operated frequencies may be 
attributed to the coax loss and the substrate loss. 
The measures taken to prevent coax feed 
radiation are not treated. Unbalanced antennas 
with an unbalanced feedline (coax) can lead to 
radiation from the outside of the coax. In 
addition, because of the end-fire (in the y-axis) 
radiation, most of the power, which is in the 
form of the surface wave propagation, leaks out 
along the y-axis, and is attenuated by the 
substrate material.

detailed study has been performed to identify the unidirectional
radiation characteristics for the proposed monopole slot
antenna.
II. ANTENNADESIGN
Figure 1 shows the schematic configuration of the
wideband unidirectional monopole slot antenna with the F/B
ratio of up to 10 dB over the operating bands. The optimum
parameters of the proposed antenna after the optimization
process are listed in Table I. FR-4 is used as a substrate with
the dielectric constant of 4.4 and the thickness of 0.8 mm,
respectively. The proposed antenna is composite of a quarter-
wavelength open rectangular slot, a microstrip stub-protruded
feedline, two pairs of two open slots in the ground plane, seven
slits beside the radiating slot, and a pair of three-element metal
strips. The protruded stub of width Fw = 5 mm and length FL2 =
12 mm is connected to a 50-: feedline printed on the other side
of the monopole slot. A parasitic capacitance is formed due to
the electromagnetic coupling between the protruded stub and
the ground plane. Similar to the technique of adding a parasitic
capacitance at the feedline [4], this capacitance is a capacitive
loading to the slot for canceling the inductive reactance of the
slot at lower frequency. Hence, the lower resonance is shifted
down. Because of the frequency reduction, the impedance
bandwidth of the antenna will increase, as predicted. At the slot
edge, two rectangular stubs are applied to form another internal
capacitance due to a voltage difference between the two
identical stubs. According to the impedance matching theory,
the utility of the additional capacitance decreases the high
reactance of the open slot antenna and the impedance-matching
condition can be improved.
The two pairs of open slots change the traveling direction
of the surface currents flowing along the upper and lower edges
of the ground plane from the y-axis to the x-axis. The function
of the open slots is similar to that of the reflector. The array of
seven slits destroys the surface current distribution at the closed
edge of the monopole slot. The above techniques can decrease
the back radiation resulting from the backward surface wave.
As we know, by utilizing the director, usually several metal
strips, in design of the Yagi antenna [5] can improve the
antenna directivity. In our design, in order to achieve good
radiation in the end-fire direction, the pair of three-element
metal strips, which acts as the director, is placed in the front of
the radiating monopole slot antenna. At the open end of the slot,
some of the non-radiating power flows out along the x-axial
edges of the ground plane and will couple to the strip array,
which enhances the main-beam gain in the end-fire direction.
III. RESULTS
In our study, the commercial software of the Finite Element
Method (FEM) used is the High Frequency Structure Simulator
(HFSS) from Ansoft Corporation. Fig. 2 shows the comparison
of simulated reflection coefficients (S11) of the three cases of
the monopole rectangular-slot antenna, which are the
conventional monopole slot antenna with a uniform feedline,
one with a stub-protruded feedline, and protruded one with two
rectangular stubs at the edge of the monopole slot. After adding
the stubs at the slot edge, the impedance-matching condition at
the middle frequency band (about at 3 GHz) is improved. By
utilizing these two techniques, the impedance bandwidth
increases from 49.2 % (2.31 ± 3.82 GHz) to 96 % (1.42 ± 4.04
GHz). Because the lower cutoff frequency is shifted down, the
antenna size can be reduced.
It is noted that the main beam (labeling front: F) locates at
DQJOHV RI ĭ   ̓ DQG ș   ̓, and the back-lobe (labeling
EDFN % LV DW ĭ   ̓ DQG ș   ̓. For the monopole slot
antenna, the injection power leaks out mainly by the surface
wave which results from the surface currents on the ground
plane. The surface wave flows along the edges of the monopole
slot and radiates out in the end-fire (front) direction, positioned

monopole slot antenna, the front-to-back (F/B) ratios of the
antenna with the Reflector A increases. For the optimum case
of AL = 31 mm, the F/B ratios at 1.8, 2.1, 2.4 3.0 and 3.6 GHz
are 16.64, 7.72, 4.41, 5.55, 6.00 dB. In Fig. 3(a), for the case

conventional monopole slot antenna, the proposed antenna
achieves unidirectional radiation, similar to the end-fire
radiating antennas, such as the Yagi antenna.
IV. CONCLUSION
This work has described a microstrip-line fed open-end
monopole slot antenna with unidirectional symmetrical
radiation patterns, which is composed of a quarter-wavelength
slot antenna, a stub-protruded feeding structure, two pairs of
the open slot as reflectors, seven slits beside the radiating slot,
and a pair of three-element metal strips near to the open end.
Our results demonstrate that, with the proposed techniques, the
front-to-back ratio of the antenna can increase more than 10 dB,
which presents the unidirectional radiation characteristics. The
proposed antenna could be utilized in wireless system-on-
package RF front-end devices for ultrafast applications in
wireless local area networks.
