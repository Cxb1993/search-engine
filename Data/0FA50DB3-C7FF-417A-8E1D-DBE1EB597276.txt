本研究報告為 NOR型態與 NAND型態快閃式記憶體 SONOS之可靠度分析
探討。內容包含隨機電報雜訊(RTN)、單電子流失造成臨界電壓(Vt)之變化。相
關之數值模型以及三維原子模型亦在此報告提出。除此之外，吾人也在不同結構
(平面及 FinFET)SONOS元件做 RTN之統計分析。 
在 RTN 部分，吾人提出了可觀測 NOR 型態中寫入電荷水平分佈之方法。
藉由此方法可推估熱電子寫入之水平分佈範圍約為 20奈米，且二次電子寫入也
由此方法證實分佈範圍更為寬廣。除此之外，吾人經研究發現在 NOR形態中熱
電子寫入之分佈範圍與 band-to-band熱電洞抹除之分佈範圍並非一致，造成元件
在 erase-state 下會有寫入電荷分佈非均勻現象發生。在 NAND 型態 SONOS 部
分，除了 RTN實驗數據分析外，吾人亦對平面 SONOS、浮停閘(floating gate)快
閃式記憶體及 FinFET SONOS 做了 RTN 之振幅模擬分析。吾人發現在平面
SONOS中 RTN振幅在 program-state與 erase-state時並不相同，且分佈並無規律。
然而在浮停閘快閃式記憶體中，RTN振幅在 program-state與 erase-state卻是一致
的，並不會因為狀態而改變。吾人也利用了三度空間原子模擬，模擬結果與實驗
結果一致，而吾人推測此結果應為在 SONOS中 nitride寫入電荷為隨機且不連續
造成電流路徑之穿隧效應而使得 RTN振幅在不同狀態下的不同。最後，吾人發
現 RTN振幅在 FinFET SONOS中有明顯下降之趨勢。 
在寫入電荷流失(program charge loss)部分，吾人亦分別對 NAND及 NOR型
態 SONOS做了實驗及模擬分析。不論是在 NAND或 NOR型態 SONOS，吾人
皆可觀察到單一電荷流失造成臨界電壓變化之現象，即在一個為寫入狀態

ABSTRACT 
 
This report will focus on the reliability issue, random telegraph noise (RTN), 
single charge loss induced Vt in both NOR-type and NAND-type SONOS. A 
numerical model for retention loss and 3D atomistic model for RTN are developed. A 
statistical study of RTN is also reported for both planar and FinFet SONOS. 
A novel RTN method is proposed to characterize the lateral distribution of 
injected charge in program and erase states in a NOR-type SONOS flash memory. By 
using this method, the lateral width of injected charge induced channel potential 
barrier is shown to be around 20nm in channel hot electron (CHE) program. We also 
find that channel initiated secondary electron (CHISEL) program has a broader 
injected charge distribution than CHE program. A mismatch of CHE program 
electrons and band-to-band tunneling erase holes is observed. Nitride program charge 
effects on RTN in NAND-type SONOS flash cells are also investigated. We measure 
and simulate RTN amplitudes in floating gate flash, planar SONOS, and FinFET 
SONOS cells. We find that a planar SONOS has a wide spread in RTN amplitude 
after programming while a floating gate flash cell has identical RTN amplitude in 
erase and program states. A 3D atomistic simulation is also developed, and the result 
is consistent with the experiment data. The spread of program-state RTN amplitudes 
in a planar SONOS is attributed to a current-path percolation effect caused by random 
discrete nitride charges. The program-state RTN spread can be significantly reduced 
in FinFET SONOS. 
Discrete nitride program charge loss in both NAND-type and NOR-type SONOS 
flash memory cell during retention are observed. Our measurement shows that a

the CP profiling technique is applicable only when a charge density increases 
monotonically along the channel [6]. For a two-pole charge profile in erase 
state, the CP method is not appropriate. On the other side, the inverse I-V 
modeling is an indirect method. A charge lateral distribution is extracted from 
a two-dimensional device simulation by fitting simulated subthreshold and 
GIDL characteristics to measurement results. The inverse I-V modeling also 
suffers from some limitations. First, it requires the knowledge of a 
two-dimensional device doping profile in device simulation. A specific shape 
of a program/erase charge distribution is usually given in priori in simulation, 
for example, a rectangular charge packet or a Gaussian-like charge 
distribution [4]-[5]. Second, the method does not yield a unique solution. The 
simulated width of a program-state charge distribution varies considerably in 
literature, from 20-40nm in [4]-[6] to 85nm in [11]. In this work, we will 
propose a new charge profiling technique based on random telegraph signal. 
This technique is very sensitive to injected electrons or holes in 
program/erase operation and charge loss during retention. Moreover, this 
technique is suitable for a small area cell and does not need a 2D numerical 
device simulation. 
Random telegraph signal in the channel current of a SONOS cell arises 
from electron emission and capture at a SiO2/Si interface trap. Recently, it has 
been recognized as a major scaling concern in flash memories [12] since Vt 
fluctuations originated from a large amplitude RTS will cause a read error in a 
multilevel-cell flash memory [13]-[14]. On the other hand, since RTS is very 
sensitive to a local potential change near the trap, it can be used as internal 
probe to detect a variation in a trapped charge density during program, erase 
and retention. The waveform of RTS may exhibit two-level or multi-level 
4 
 
1.2 Device Description and Measurement Setup 
Measurements were carried out on SONOS flash cells with an ONO 
thickness of 8.5nm (top oxide), 7nm (nitride) and 5.5nm (bottom oxide), 
respectively. The channel width and length are W/L=0.11m/0.1m. The 
CHE program condition is Vgs=8V and Vds=3.7V. The BTBT hot hole erase is 
at Vgs=-4V and Vds=5V. RTS is measured at a small Vds that the device is 
operated in the linear region and the channel electric field is uniform.  
 
1.3 Results and Discussions 
1.3.1 Extraction of an Interface Trap Position 
Typical two-level RTS waveform is shown in Fig. 1.1 The average 
electron capture time <c>, as illustrated in Fig. 1.1, can be expressed below,

<τ >=
n συ
              (1.1) 
 
where  is a trap cross-section, υth is a thermal velocity and ne is an 
electron concentration in the channel right below the trap. ne is a function of a 
gate overdrive, i.e. ne=f(Vgs-Vts), where Vts is the channel potential at the trap 
position and is equal to (1-xt/L)Vds. xt is the distance of the trap from the 
drain edge and L is the channel length, as shown in Fig. 1.1. It should be 
mentioned that a uniform channel electric field is assumed here. A pocket 
implant may induce a non-uniform electric field. This non-uniform electric 
field effect, however, can be reduced by using a larger gate overdrive voltage 
in RTS measurement. 
An interface trap position (xt) in the channel can be extracted in a way 
6 
 
where g is a degeneracy factor [17]. ET is the trap energy and s is a local 
potential change at the trap position due to injected program charge. Note 
that Eq. (3) still holds even though a phonon-assisted transition process is 
considered. 
 
1.3.2 CHE Program Charge Lateral Profile 
To profile the lateral charge distribution by CHE programming, four 
SONOS cells are used with a respective trap position at xt=0.03L, 0.05L, 0.2L 
and 0.3L from the drain junction. Fig. 1.4 shows RTS traces of the channel 
current at three program Vt(=0.3V, 0.9V, 1.2V) in the xt=0.2L cell. The RTS 
measurement is fixed at Vgs=3.5V and Vds=0.05V. The device is in strong 
inversion at the measurement biases. Fig. 1.5 shows measured average 
capture time <c> and emission time <e> versus program Vt. The minimum 
integration time is 0.5ms and the total sampling period is 10s. The observed 
trends in the <c> and <e> versus program Vt are similar to previous results 
[18]. The ratio of average capture time to emission time <c>/<e> and a 
corresponding surface potential change (s) at xt from Eq. (2) are plotted in 
Fig. 1.6. As more electrons are injected into the nitride layer, the conduction 
band-edge at xt and the trap level move upward with respect to the Fermi 
level. Thus, the <c>/<e> ratio increases with Vt. The measured <c>/<e> 
versus Vt in the four cells are shown in Fig. 1.7. For a xt closer to the drain 
junction, for example, the xt=0.03L cell, the c/e ratio increases more rapidly 
with Vt, implying a higher program charge density at the trap position 
xt=0.03L. In contrast, the c/e remains almost unchanged in the xt=0.3L cell, 
which means the injected program charge does not reach the trap point 
during program. The surface potential energy change along the channel for a 
8 
 
is at xt=0.05L in the channel. The c/e curves during program and erase 
match reasonably well, suggesting that program electrons at 0.05L can be 
totally neutralized by erase holes. To examine the charge polarity in erase 
state, the c/e near Vt=0V is re-drawn in a log scale in the inset of Fig. 1.10. 
The erase-state c/e is actually lower than its value in a fresh state. This result 
provides evidence of hole accumulation near the drain junction in erase state. 
This phenomenon becomes more pronounced in an over-erased cell, i.e., 
Vt<0V. On the contrary, in Fig. 1.11 where the monitor point is at xt=0.3L, the 
c/e ratio is significantly above its original value after a P/E cycle. The larger 
c/e value after one P/E cycle implies the existence of some residual program 
electrons at xt=0.3L although the cell has been erased to its original Vt. 
Combining the results in Figs. 1.10 and 1.11, the charge distributions in 
program and in erase are depicted in Fig. 1.12. A misalignment of injected 
erase holes and program electrons [11], [21] is concluded. The erase holes 
have a narrower spatial distribution than CHE program electrons. 
 
1.3.5 Program Charge Retention Loss 
Two types of models have been published to explain the observed 
program-state Vt retention loss in a SONOS cell. The first one is nitride charge 
vertical loss through P/E cycling induced oxide traps [22]-[26]. The second 
type of the models explains the Vt retention loss by lateral redistribution of 
nitride charges in program state [27]-[30]. The possibility of program electron 
lateral movement [30] is explored by the RTS method in Fig. 1.13. The cell has 
only one-time program and then is subject to high temperature bake. The trap 
position is at 0.03L from the drain. The result shows that the c/e remains the 
same during the bake, indicating that the program electron concentration is 
10 
 
shows the read current variation versus gate stress time in a 33 P/E cycled 
cell. The setup for this measurement is shown in Fig. 1.16(b) [14]. An 
electronic switch is used to record gate stress time accurately. The sampling 
rate is 10kHz, which enable the observation of read current switching with 
time resolution up to 0.1ms. Both RTS and long-term nitride charge escape are 
both observed. Individual nitride charge loss is manifested by a long-term 
abrupt increase of a read current. During two consecutive nitride charge 
escapes, RTS is observed. It should be stressed that the “average” read current 
level remains constant between two consecutive nitride charge escapes. This 
stepwise evolution characteristic provides an evidence of the vertical charge 
loss. One major argument in [28] against the vertical loss model is “the 
bottleneck of the carrier loss is either the tunneling or the Frenkel-Poole 
detrapping”. This argument is incorrect since they do not consider the 
re-capture of nitride conduction band electrons into nitride traps before 
tunneling out through the bottom oxide. By taking into account the re-capture 
process, we showed [31] that even in the Frenkel-Poole (FP) emission limited 
condition (i.e., Frenkel-Poole emission time longer than oxide tunneling time) 
the nitride charge retention time can be approximated by

Vt Retention Distribution Tail in a 
Multi-Time-Program MLC SONOS Memory 
due to a Random Program Charge Induced 
Current-Path Percolation Effect 
                        
2.1 Preface 
Silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) flash memory has received much 
interest because it offers better performance with a small cell size, fast program/erase, 
and memory retention improvement than a floating gate flash memory [1]. SONOS 
cells with a vertical gate [36,37] have been considered as a promising candidate for a 
3D nonvolatile memory in tera-bit storage applications. However, as the scaling of the 
SONOS technology advances aggressively, significant variations of Vt retention loss 
in SONOS cells are observed because of a reduced number of stored charges [38]. For 
a technology node beyond 45nm, only tens of electrons are stored in each program 
level of a MLC SONOS. A single charge loss would induce a large variation in read 
current and sometimes result in a read failure. Two kinds of single charge phenomena 
in a flash cell have been reported. One is the switching of a read current between two 
current levels, referred to as random telegraph noise (RTN), due to a single charge 
emission and capture at an interface oxide trap. The other is discrete program charge 
retention loss, which is manifested by a stepwise increase of a read current versus 
retention time [38]. The RTN amplitudes in floating-gate (FG) flash and SONOS cells 
have been studied extensively [39]. The RTN amplitudes are found to follow an 
exponential distribution approximately in both FG and SONOS cells due to a current

Vs=8.5V/4.2V and Vg/ Vs=-7V/4V respectively. To characterize a single program 
charge loss induced Vt, our measurement consists of two alternating phases, 
retention loss phase and read phase. The Vd in read phase is 1.5V. To accelerate 
program charge loss, a negative gate bias of -5V was applied in the retention phase. 
Fig. 2.1 shows the evolution of a read current with cumulative retention time in a 18 
P/E cycles SONOS cell. Discrete nitride program charge loss is clearly observed, 
which is manifested by sudden jumps in a read current. Each current jump is realized 
due to a single program charge loss [38]. Two-level RTN is also noticed in the figure. 
A corresponding Vt retention trace is plotted in the inset of the figure, which is 
obtained from the measured current divided by a transconductance at the read current. 
The reason why we measure a read current rather than a threshold voltage directly is 
that the current measurement has a better resolution. It should be mentioned that the 
magnitude of a single charge induced Vt varies from a program charge to a program 
charge. This feature is different from a FG flash cell, where each program charge loss 
should induce the same Vt shift. Moreover, we measure Vt retention traces at three 
different P/E cycles. The result is shown in Fig. 2.2. Because the placement of 
program charges changes at a different P/E cycle, the Vt retention trace varies from a 
cycle to a cycle, suggesting that current percolation paths in program state are 
determined by injected program charges. An average of Vt retention traces in 40 
devices is shown in Fig. 2.3. The log(t) dependence of Vt retention loss in Fig. 2.3 is 
consistent with a Frenkel-Poole charge emission model [22]. 
We collect all the Vt jumps from more than 80 retention traces in different P/E 
cycles in totally 40 devices. The cumulative probability distribution of the Vt 
magnitude is shown in Fig. 2.4 in three program levels (“10” , “01”, and 
“00”, which are defined as a program Vt window of 1V, 2V, and 3V respectively.). 
Data points with Vt less than 5 mV are not drawn here because of the resolution of 
34 
 
make a note about the comparison of RTN amplitudes and a program charge loss 
induced Vt. We measure RTN amplitudes in 30 SONOS cells. Thevalue of RTN 
is about Vt=12mV, significantly smaller than thevalue of a program charge loss 
induced Vt. The reason is that RTN traps in MTP SONOS cells are randomly 
distributed in the channel and only a small part of RTN traps are in the program 
charge region of about 15nm [45]. As pointed out earlier, a charge loss in a high 
lateral field region (program charge region), no matter of a RTN charge or a program 
charge, yields a larger Vt. Thus, most of RTN induced Vt are small. This can 
explain why program charge loss rather than RTN dominates the Vt retention tail in a 
512 Mb SONOS memory. 
 
2.3 Modeling of Vt Retention Distribution 
In this section, a numerical model to simulate a Vt retention distribution is 
developed. Our model includes a program charge induced percolation effect and a 
Poisson distribution based multiple charge loss model. The distribution function of a 
single program charge loss inducedVt is expressed as 
 
1
( ) exp( )tt

 

                                           (2.1) 
 
whereis an average value of Vt and also the standard deviation of the 
distribution. Assume g(Vt) is a program Vt distribution immediately after program, 
which can be obtained from measurement. The Vt distribution after a single charge 
loss is calculated from a convolution integral of f(Vt) and g(Vt), that is,  
 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )*t t t t t tf V g V f V g V V d V                              (2.2) 
36 
 
result is shown in Fig. 2.9. The single charge loss dominates a post-retention Vt tail 
because a single-charge loss probability  is  much  larger  than  the  probability  
of  multiple- charge loss. This result reveals that the Vt retention loss tail in a 
SONOS memory is mainly attributed to a random program charge induced 
percolation effect. 
In addition, we simulate the percolation effect induced Vt retention tail in 
different program levels of a MLC SONOS memory. The parameteris assumed to 
be proportional to a program Vt window as a first-order approximation. The reason is 
that an average number of charge loss () should be dependent on the number of 
stored charges in a cell and the latter is proportional to a program window. For 
simplicity, we assume each program level has the same initial program Vt distribution 
g(Vt). The simulation result is plotted in Fig. 2.10 with reference to a Program Verify 
(PV) voltage. The highest program level (“00”) apparently has a largest Vt 
retention tail due to a larger percolation effect, i.e., a largerThe large Vt tail may 
cause a read error in a MLC and requires the use of an error code correction technique 
[46]. 
 
2.4 Summary 
 We observe and characterize discrete program charge loss in a SONOS cell. A 
single program charge loss induced Vt exhibits approximately an exponential 
distribution due to a random program charge induced percolation effect. The program 
charge loss inducedVt is larger than a RTN induced Vt in a NOR-type SONOS. A 
Vt retention distribution model including the percolation effect and Poisson 
distribution based multiple charge loss has been developed. Our model can simulate a 
post-retention Vt distribution in a MTP SONOS memory. Our simulation confirms 
that the observed post-retention Vt distribution tail is attributed to the percolation

Variations of Vt Retention Loss in a SONOS 
Flash Memory Due to a Current-Path 
Percolation Effect 
                      
3.1 Preface 
As the scaling of the flash memory technology advances aggressively, the number 
of program electrons in a flash cell reduces greatly. A single charge loss would induce 
large variations in read current and sometimes result in a read failure [12]. Two kinds 
of single charge phenomena have been reported. One is the switching of a read current 
between two current levels, referred to as random telegraph noise (RTN), due to a 
single charge emission and capture at an interface trap [40]. The other is discrete 
program charge retention loss, which is manifested by a staircase-like evolution of a 
read current with retention time [14]. The amplitudes of RTN in a floating gate flash 
memory have been shown to exhibit an exponential distribution due to a random 
substrate dopant induced current-path percolation effect [40,47,48]. Unlike a floating 
gate flash cell, current percolation paths in a SONOS cell are affected by random and 
discrete nitride program charges [49]. In this work, we intend to investigate the spread 
of Vt retention loss due to the percolation effect in a SONOS memory. Individual 
single-program charge emission induced Vt shifts (Vt) are characterized and their 
statistical distribution is analyzed. A Monte Carlo analysis taking into account the Vt 
distribution is developed to study the spread of a retention Vt distribution at different 
retention times. 
To characterize a single program charge loss induced Vt, our measurement 
50 
 
result is consistent with a tunneling front model [50] for an ultra-thin bottom oxide. 
Furthermore, we record all the voltage jumps (Vt) in the retention traces and plot 
their magnitude distribution in Fig. 3.3. Data points with Vt less than 10mV are not 
drawn because of the resolution of the measurement. We find that the magnitudes of 
the Vt exhibit an exponential distribution, i.e. f(Vt)=exp(-Vt/)/where the  
standard deviation is about 8mV. It should be remarked that both RTN and nitride 
charge loss may be present in some devices. In Fig. 3.2, we only display the result 
without RTN to focus on nitride charge loss. 
In addition, we perform a three-dimensional device simulation with uniform 
substrate doping and program charge distributions to simulate a case without a 
percolation effect. We find that a maximum Vt due to a single program charge loss, 
in the halfway of the channel where a program charge has a largest electrostatic 
control of channel conduction, is only about 12mV. Thus, we attribute the large Vt 
distribution tail in Fig. 3.3 to a percolation effect. The exponential distribution here is 
consistent with the result in [43,51,52]. Moreover, we develop a Monte Carlo analysis 
taking into account the exponential distribution of theVt and a tunneling front 
model to evaluate the spread of a Vt retention loss distribution. The simulation 
procedure is described as follows. First, program charges are randomly placed in the 
nitride layer with a density of 6.3x1018 1/cm3. The nitride charge density is obtained 
from a program Vt window. The charge tunneling timeof each trapped charge is 
calculated from its distance to the Si surface according to a direct tunneling model. 
For a retention timet, a random number r between 0 and 1 is generated and nitride 
program charge emission occurs if r is larger than exp(-t/). A Vt for each emitted 
program charge is randomly selected based on the distribution of 
f(Vt)=exp(-Vt/)/. The total Vt retention loss is the sum of all the Vt. The 
simulated Vt evolution with cumulative retention time in three SONOS cells is shown 
52

4.2.1 FG flash vs Planar SONOS 
We measured single-trap RTN relative amplitudes (ΔId/Id) in 40 FG flash cells. 
The cell dimension is W/L=0.11μm/0.09μm. RTN amplitudes in erase-state and in 
program-state are traced in each cell at the same read current level of 500nA (Fig. 4.1). 
Devices with RTN amplitudes less than 3% are excluded in Fig. 4.1 to avoid possible 
measurement errors. We find that program-state and erasestate RTN have identical 
amplitudes, no matter what program ΔVt is, 1V or 2V. The RTN amplitude versus 
the drain current in the first three P/E cycles is shown in Fig. 4.2. In RTN 
measurement, the drain voltage is fixed at 0.7V and the gate voltage is varied that the 
drain current ranges from 50nA to 2μA. The result shows program-state and 
erase-state have the same RTN characteristics and implies that program charges in a 
FG do not alter current percolation paths caused by substrate dopants. 
As a contrast, a distinctly different feature is obtained in planar SONOS cells. 
Fig. 4.3 shows program-state RTN versus erase-state RTN in 60 planar SONOS cells. 
The SONOS cells have W/L=0.09μm/0.08μm. The thickness of the ONO layers is 
2.8nm (tunnel oxide), 6nm (SiN) and 6nm (top oxide). The RTN amplitudes spread in 
a wide range after programming and are almost independent of erase-state RTN. The 
P/E cycle dependence of RTN is shown in Fig. 4.4. The programstate RTN amplitude 
varies from cycle to cycle, suggesting that program charges play an important role in 
current percolation paths. The measured RTN waveforms and the Id-Vg are shown in 
Fig. 4.5. Two-level current switching is observed, showing that RTN arises from a 
single trap. Fig. 4.6 illustrates random program charges in the SiN layer and current 
percolation paths. 
To evaluate a percolation effect on RTN, we performed a 3D atomistic 
simulation [40]. In FG cell simulation, substrate dopants are randomly placed, but 
program charges have a continuous distribution. An equi-potential condition in a FG 
60 
 
where x and y denote RTN amplitudes in erase-state and in program-state, 
respectively, and x and y are average values. A larger correlation factor suggests a 
smaller program charge induced percolation effect. The measured correlation factor is 
1.0 in FG flash, 0.29 in planar SONOS, 0.82 (and 0.94) in Wfin=25nm (and 
Wfin=10nm) FinFET SONOS (Table 1). The reason for the smaller percolation effect 
in a FinFET structure is two-fold; First, unlike a planar SONOS where percolation 
paths are distributed widely in the gate width direction, conducting paths in a FinFET 
SONOS are confined to a small region in the corners of the Si fin (Fig. 4.12). Second, 
in   real device, the corners are rounded and the shape is like an arc. For a 
sufficiently small silicon radius, program nitride charges with different angular 
coordinates should have a similar effect on the conducting channel due to a circular 
symmetry. As a result, the FinFET structure has a smaller program charge effect. 
 
4.3 Summary 
Read failure due to a RTN induced Vt tail is an important issue in flash memory 
scaling. In a planar MLC SONOS, the program-state RTN distribution is affected by 
both random program charges and substrate dopants. The program charge effect has to 
be considered in RTN modeling in a MLC SONOS. The program charge induced 
percolation effect can be significantly reduced in a surrounding gate structure, such as 
a FinFET SONOS.

Characterization of Junction Dosage Effect on 
NANDArrays with Charge Pumping Method 
 
5.1 Preface 
 As demand from high-density NAND flash memories, the cell is not only 
aggressively scaled down in technology node [57,58] but also required to increase in 
defined VT levels [59,60]. Program disturbance [61] and RTN [62] are proposed as 
two killing reliability issues. From previous studies, doping profile beneath gate edges 
[63] and VT uniformity along channel [64] are key factors for them. In this work, 
floating-gate cells with different S/D dosages are fabricated by 75nm technology. A 
NAND string is composed of 32 serially connected cells. The VT of a cell is defined 
as the required gate voltage to reach a certain read current. The junction dosage 
effects on RTN and program disturbance are then carefully reviewed. 
 
5.2 Experimental result and Discussions 
5.2.1 RTN measurement 
 In Fig. 5.1, the initial VT distribution is almost the same for cells with different 
S/D dosages. In Fig. 5.2, the read current stability under a fixed read voltage is 
measured. It is found that a lightly doped cell shows a larger current fluctuation in 
time dominant (Fig. 5.2(a)) and thus a wider read current distribution is obtained in 
our test chip (Fig. 5.2(b)). As published in [64,65], the most part of noise origins from 
gate edges owing to etching damage and/or local potential variation. In other words, a 
lighter S/D dosage means a poorer ability to shield from these damages and that is 
76 
 
the main peak of  disturbed cells keeps unchanged but its upper part exhibits a tail 
behavior with increasing Vg,pgm as depicted in Fig. 5.6(b). In Fig. 5.6(c), this tail 
behavior becomes worse when the number of program pulse (NOP) increases while 
the peak value of programmed cell VT distribution hardly changes. The formation of 
these tail behavior can be elucidated as follows. Although most cells still have enough 
dosage to induce GSB, some of the cells do not have sufficient S/D dosage due to the 
statistical variation of fabrication processes and these cells may suffer from hot-carrier 
disturbance [69]. This explains why the main peak of VT distribution stays and the 
disturbed ones are randomly scattered over the test chip. 
 
5.2.3 Charge PumpingMeasurement 
 The gate voltage waveform in charge pumping measurement (CP) is illustrated 
in Fig. 5.7(a). The pulse has a fixed high level (Vgh=6.5V) and a variable low level 
(Vgl) to portray the local potential along the channel. The gate pulse has a frequency 
of 1.5 MHz, a 50% duty cycle, and 10 ns rise/fall times. If junction dosage is too light, 
the local VT will increase near gate edge and expects to exhibit a clear hump in the 
low CP current (Icp) region as described in [70]. Fig. 5.7(b) shows the Icp hump 
appears with decreasing S/D dosage. After testing for over 50 samples, the occurrence 
of hump is compared in Fig. 5.8(a) and the implanted dosage shows a negative 
correlation with it. Furthermore, strings with and without hump are chosen within the 
same wafer. And then, the program disturbances of these strings are compared in Fig. 
5.8 (b) and Fig. 5.8 (c). Similar to Fig. 5.6, Vpass,pgm=3V leads to a parallel shift in 
VT for both cases while a tail VT behavior is observed for those with hump at 
Vpass,pgm=14V .

The programming speeds of this method and the two conventional methods are 
compared in Fig. 6.3. Obviously, our method has a faster programming speed. An 
enlargement of a Vt window by ~0.9V is obtained in this method. We measured a 
program current transient by using a setup in Fig. 6.4. Fig. 6.5 shows the program 
transient currents in this method and in method B. In this method, the program cell 
current (IBL(N+1)) decreases with time while IBL(N) increases. The Vt shift versus 
cumulative channel charge fluence in the program cell is shown in Fig. 6.6. The result 
shows that, with the same amount of charges flowing through a program cell, our 
method has a larger Vt shift than a conventional CHISEL method, indicating higher 
electron injection efficiency. We examine the source electron energy boosting effect 
by varying VBL(N) (Fig. 6.7(a)). An increase of a Vt window, defined as ΔVt(this 
method)-ΔVt(method B), is obtained as VBL(N) increases. The BD width dependence is 
investigated in Fig. 6.7(b). Two different BD widths, 0.10μm and 0.12μm, were 
fabricated. The smaller BD width apparently has higher injection energy and thus a 
larger program Vt window. Program disturb and the second bit effect [74] are also 
characterized. No program disturb in cell (N-1) is observed by using this method (Fig. 
6.8(a)). The second bit effect is evaluated by measuring forward-read ΔVt versus 
reverse-read ΔVt. Fig. 6.8(b) shows that the program charge still has a tight 
distribution near the drain by using this method and there is no degradation of the 
second bit effect. The influence of charge storage in a pre-acceleration cell on a 
program speed is examined. Fig. 6.9 shows that charge storage in a pre-acceleration 
cell only has a very small effect on the program speed. 
 
6.3 Monte Carlo Analysis 
To verify the concept of this method, a three-step Monte Carlo (MC) simulation 
(Fig. 6.10) similar to [75] is performed. Fig. 6.11 shows MC-simulated electron
