stacking sequence of {111}FCC plane in this martensite is 
(4.1915,1.8085)3 [7,9,10]. Despite the controversy over the 
structure, it is interesting in this study whether the 
needle-like 18R martensites will significantly affect the 
susceptibility to the pitting corrosion or not.  
Figure 3(a) is a SEM graph of the as-quenched 
Femac-0.32C alloy. A high density of the needle-like 18R 
martensites can still be found within the α grains, as 
shown in Figure 3(b). It is worthy to note that wide and 
rather narrow martensite-free zones (MFZs) inside the 
ferrite grains can be seen along the α/γ grain boundaries 
and the α/α grain boundaries, respectively. The MFZs are 
thought to be due to the depletion of the carbon atoms 
which diffused to the nearby γ phases having a higher 
carbon solubility in comparison with the α phase [8]. 
Otherwise, the width of the MFZs should be similar 
regardless of kinds of grain boundaries. 
Along with increasing the carbon content to 0.61 
wt.%, in addition to the increase in the volume fraction of 
the γ phases, there is no difference in the microstructural 
constitution between the Femac-0.32C and Femac-0.61C 
alloys, as shown in Figures 4 (a) and (b). The neddle-like 
18R martensites and the MFZs could still be found in the 
Femac-0.61C alloy. In contrast to the Femac alloys with 
0.06, 0.32 and 0.61 wt.% carbon, the formation of the 
18R martensites within the discrete ferrite grains in the 
Femac-0.72C alloy is absent, as shown in Figure 5. The 
microstructure of the alloy is composed of the duplex 
phases of γ and α. Figure 6 is a scanning electron 
micrograph of the Femac-0.93C alloy in the as-quenched 
condition, exhibiting a single-phase γ with annealing 
twins. Also, no precipitates could be detected within the 
austenite phase by either SEM or TEM.  
Figure 7(a) shows a scanning SEM graph of the 
as-quenched Femac-1.25C alloy. The morphology may 
suggest that the microstructure is still a single-phase γ. 
However, the BF electron micrograph reveals that a high 
density of fine precipitates with a modulation structure 
was formed within the γ matrix, as can be seen in Figure 
7(b). Figure 7(c), a SADP indicates that the fine 
precipitates are (Fe,Mn)3AlCx cabides (designated as 
κ'-carbides) having an L'12-type structure [11]. The 
existence of the satellites demonstrates that the fine 
κ'-carbides were formed during quenching by a spinodal 
decomposition. Figure 7(d) is a (010) κ'-carbides DF 
electron micrograph of the as-quenched Femac-1.25C 
alloy.  
C. SEM observations on the pitting corrosion 
behaviors 
In order to investigate the susceptible areas and the 
modes of pitting attack, the present specimens were test 
by immersion test in 6 wt.% ferric chloride solution. 
Moreover, the fresh specimens were held at potentials 
just slightly above their critical pitting potentials in a 3.5 
wt.% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution at room 
temperature to accelerate the pitting corrosion and then 
examined by the SEM to observe the behavior of the pit 
propagation. The localized attacks are clearly found to be 
around the 18R martensites in the initial stage of the 
pitting corrosion after the Femac-0.06C alloy was 
immersed in FeCl3(aq) for a short time period, as shown in 
Figure 8(a). With raising immersing time, there are a 
large number of growing pits in the interiors of the α 
grains but along the α/α grain boundaries, as shown in 
Figure 8(b). This indicates that the 18R martensite is 
much more susceptible to the pitting attack than the α/α 
grain boundary. Figure 8(c) exhibits a severely corroded 
surface after applying a pitting potential to the 
Femac-0.06C alloy, revealing that the pitting attacked 
areas extend to the α/α grain boundaries and the whole 
ferrite grains. 
For the Femac-0.32C alloy, the 18R martensite 
interfaces also acts as the nucleation sites for the pitting 
corrosion in the immersion test and the subsequent attack 
causes pits to coarsen and grow inside the α grains, as 
shown in Figures 9(a) and (b). Based on the EDS analysis, 
it is verified that such pits occurred inside the γ grains are 
attributed to two kinds of inclusions. One is the 
manganese sulfide and the other is the aluminum oxide, 
which were produced during the melting process and 
retained in the ingot as solidifying. Figure 9(c) shows that 
the whole α grains were severely corroded after applying 
a pitting potential to the Femac-0.32C alloy. From these 
observations, it is suggested that the pits initiated at the 
18R martensite interfaces in the interiors of the α grains 
and then gradually grew towards the grain boundaries. 
However, on the other hand, in addition to a few pits due 
to the existence of the manganese sulfide and aluminum 
oxide inclusions, no other pits related to the 
microstructural factors could be found inside the γ grains. 
Compared to the Femac-0.32C alloy, the severely pitting 
attacked area is reduced with the increase in the volume 
fraction of the γ phase in the Femac-0.61C alloy, as 
shown in Figure 10. As can be seen in Figures 11(a) and 
(b), the nucleation of the pits occurred first at the α/γ 
grain boundaries rather than inside the α grains. 
Subsequently, the pitting attacks proceeded to the interior 
of the relatively small and discrete α grains. Although the 
mode of the pitting attack inside the α grains is quite 
different as increasing carbon content from 0.61 to 0.72 
wt%, the existence of the inclusions is still the main 
reason to facilitate the pitting corrosion in the austenite 
grains.  
In Figure 12(a), the pitting corrosion originating 
from the inclusions becomes predominant in the 
single-phase austenite, where the pits were dispersed at 
random within the γ matrix. It is seen in Figure 12(b) that 
the larger and deeper pits followed the inclusion-induced 
pits after applying a pitting potential to the Femac-0.93C 
alloy. 
Figures 13(a) and (b) are two SEM graphs for 
increasing the carbon content to 1.25 or 1.58 wt.% after 
the immersion and accelerated pitting corrosion tests, 
respectively. Compared to the Femac-0.93C alloy, there 
appears to be no difference in the behavior of the pitting 
attack between the γ matrix with and without the 
precipitation of the fine κ'-carbides. The existence of the 
retained inclusions is believed to be the reason to cause 
the pitting corrosion in the austenite grains. There are no 
evidences that the pitting attack is related to the 
precipitation of the fine κ'-carbides. 
D. Relationship between the pitting corrosion 
behaviors and the microstructures 
On the basis of the above observations, some 
discussion in detail will be given below. The present 
Femac alloys can be classified into the three main groups, 
(5) The retained inclusions of manganese sulfide and 
aluminum oxide are responsible for the deterioration 
in the pitting resistance of the austenite phase.
