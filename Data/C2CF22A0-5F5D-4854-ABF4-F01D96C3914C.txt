1 Introduction 
Linkou terrace comprises lateritic soil, weathered gravel, and gravel, which indicates that the 
lateritic soil has possibly been weathered and leached from the gravel and its fillings (Chen & Liu, 
1993). Because the soil is loosely cohered and consolidated, erosion, slope instability, and 
landslides are often encountered in these areas. As a result, the problems of slope instability, 
erosion and landslides of lateritic soil have been the most discussed topics in Taiwan (Chen & Liu, 
1993).  
 
A landslide occurred in the compound of Taipei National University of the Arts (TNUA), which is 
on the edge of Linkou terrace, on September 29, 2001. The collapsed slope covered an area of 
about 250 m long and 50 to 150 m wide with an average area of about 2.5 hectare. Due to the 
unique location of ground water table in the slope, soils between the slope surface and ground 
water table are in unsaturated state. During long raining season, heavy rainfall intensity will 
inevitably force the shear strength of these soils to depreciate and subsequently cause the slope to 
fail. Conventional slope stability analyses are normally carried out for saturated soil slope but they 
failed to consider the engineering characteristics such as matric suction of unsaturated soil in the 
stability problem. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of rainstorm 
infiltration on this unstable slope using numerical method. This report briefly presents the 
background and the stability analysis results of the study.  
 
 
 
2 Outline of the Study Area  
The study slope was about 60 m high with the toe located at EL. 34 m while the crest located at EL. 
94 m and mean inclination angle of 25°. At the crest of the slope, a swimming pool, running track 
and two tennis courts were constructed and retained by a retaining wall. Several landslides had 
occurred between 1980 and 2001 (Fig 1). Comparing the failure profiles between 1980 and 2001, 
most of the failed slopes have slip surface located in the fill layer (台北市大地工程技師公會, 
2001).

2.1 Site Topography and Geology  
According to the 50,000:1 Taiwan geological map, the geology of the collapsed area belongs to the 
Tuff Breccia group, which is mainly volcanic debris that formed by Andesite debris, fine-grained

Between 13 and 19 September 2001, Taiwan suffered from the Nari typhoon that overwhelmed the 
island with heavy rainfall and caused severe damages to 19 counties and cities throughout the 
island. The rain brought devastating mud/landslides that took hundreds of lives and severe floods 
that inundated tens of thousands of homes. Many bridges and roadways were destroyed, five 
apartment buildings were collapsed, and utility services were cut off in many areas. While the 
island was busy assessing and recovering from this damage, typhoon Lekima struck between 23 
and 28 September, 2001 (http://rdc28.cwb.gov.tw/data.php). There was no significant damage 
since everyone was well prepared, except that the study slope failed on September 29, 2001. 
 
 
 
3 NUMERICAL MODELING 
3.1 Numerical Programs Used  
The numerical programs used were SVFlux, SVSolid and SVDynamic, which incorporated 
automatic mesh refinement and database technologies to provide fast solutions to 2D and 3D 
problems with complex geometry and unsaturated conditions. Detailed description of the programs 
can be found in the website www.soilvision.com. 
 
 
3.2 Geometry of Slope 
The plan of the study area is shown in Fig 3; and Fig 4 (a) and (b) show the profiles used in the 
study. The two soil layers from the top are CL soil and Volcano ash formation. In order to simplify 
the problem it was assumed that the slope was composed of a homogeneous and isotropic soil.

3.3.2 Groundwater  
Groundwater levels are rarely static and vary with the rate of recharge or discharge of the 
groundwater (Abramson et al., 2001). In this study, the groundwater table was assumed to be 
located in the CL layer approximately 4 m below the ground level. Runoff, evapotranspiration, and 
the effects of local groundwater recharge were not considered (Crosta, 1998). 
 
3.3.3 Boundary condition 
The boundary conditions were as follows: (a) the bottom boundary was impervious boundary, (b) 
the side boundaries were prescribed with a total water head of 83 and 32m in A-A Profile; and 81 
and 46 m in B-B Profile, (c) the surface was the boundary subjected to rainfall. The rainfall lasted 
for 15 days and the total rainfall was 1223.9 mm. 
 
3.3.4 FOS Requirement 
Under ideal conditions, a factor of safety (FOS) of at least 1 should ensure safe design, but because 
of all the uncertainties, a higher value of FOS is desirable for design recommendations (Abramson 
et al., 2001). Based on past experience, a FOS in the range of 1.3 to 1.5 was usually recommended 
as it represents a level of acceptable safety that minimizes failures (Abramson et al., 2001). Table 3 
shows the minimum FOS required in design.

factor of safety is seen significantly lower after water infiltrated into the soils. The value was just 
an indication of how easily the factor of safety was affected by the infiltrated water; the slope 
would have failed long before reaching this point.

WATER COEFFICIENT OF PERMEABILITY OF UNSATURATED LATERITIC SOIL 
M.W. Gui & C.S. Hsu 
Civil Eng Dept, NTUT, No 1 Sec 3, ZhongXiao E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan 
 
 
Abstract: Triaxial permeability test is often conducted to obtain the water coefficients of permeability of 
soil. The triaxial permeability test specimen is usually performed on intact soil specimen using a triaxial 
permeability test apparatus. During the test, the specimen is subject to a hydraulic gradient that resulted the 
flowing of water in the specimen. A series of permeability test has been undertaken for the high plasticity 
Lateritic soil obtained from Linkou terrace, Taiwan, which is frequently faced with slope stability problem 
especially during and after a heavy rainfall. The effects of net normal stress and matric suction on the water 
coefficient of permeability have been studied. Preliminary result shows that the water coefficient of 
permeability of this type of soil is only affected slightly by the net normal stress but affected significantly by 
the matric suction. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Permeability is one of the fundamental 
properties of soils. It usually governs important 
engineering problems such as the groundwater 
regime in stratified deposits, or near natural and 
excavated slopes, and the water flow through the 
structures (Leong and Rahardjo, 1997). Knowledge 
of both the saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic 
properties is essential for the analysis of slope 
stability, earth dam, solute transport behaviour, etc. 
These problems are generally analyzed using 
numerical models, which require the function of 
water coefficient of permeability and SWCC, 
which can be obtained directly from laboratory 
measurements or indirectly using empirical 
permeability model (Leong and Rahardjo, 1997). 
For saturated soils, the coefficient of 
permeability is related to the void ratio of the soil 
specimens. Changes in stress-state variables result 
in changes in void ratios and thus, in the magnitude 
of the water coefficient of permeability. For 
unsaturated soils, the water coefficient of 
permeability is related to both the void ratio and 
the degree of saturation (water content) of the soil 
specimen. (Samingan et al., 2003).  
The water coefficient of permeability decreases 
by several orders of magnitude as the soil de-
saturates from 100% to 0% degree of saturation 
(Samingan et al., 2003). Hence, the determination 
of water coefficient of permeability for unsaturated 
soil is an important problem in geotechnical and 
geo-environmental engineering. A number of direct 
and indirect methods have been proposed for 
measuring the water coefficient of permeability of 
unsaturated soils in the laboratory (Klute, 1965; 
Klute and Dirksen, 1986; Barden and Pavlakis, 
1971; and Huang et al., 1998). Generally, the direct 
methods for measuring the water coefficient of 
permeability can be classified into two main 
categories: (a) steady-state and (b) unsteady-state 
measurements; in which the steady  state method is 
the most straightforward method. 
A conventional triaxial apparatus has been 
modified and converted into a triaxial permeameter 
system and used in measuring the water coefficient 
of permeability of unsaturated lateritic soil in this 
study. This paper presents the details of the 
modifications performed and the test procedures 
involved in obtaining the water coefficient of 
permeability of the unsaturated soil. The water 
coefficient of permeability for saturated and 
unsaturated lateritic soil specimens was measured 
at different matric suctions and net normal stresses. 
The result is presented in the form of water 
coefficient of permeability versus matric suction. 
 
 
2. TRIAXIAL PERMEAMETER 
The triaxial permeameter used in this study was 
modified from a traditional triaxial device where an 
additional air pressure channel was accommodated. 
The assembly of the triaxial permeameter cell is 
shown in Figure 1(a) while Figure 1(b) shows the 
position of various valves on the pedestal. High air-
entry ceramic disk and pressures and flushing lines 
used in this study are described in the following 
sections. 
 
2.1  High air   entry ceramic disk 
In order to simulate the unsaturated condition in 
the laboratory, high air  entry ceramic disks were 
installed to the top cap and pedestal of the triaxial 
permeameter to prevent the air pressure (matric 
3rd Asian Conf. on Unsaturated Soils, Nanjing, China, 21-23 April 2007. 
 
  471  
The air pressure line was connected to an air 
pressure/volume control device where the applied 
air pressure/volume could be measured. The 
confining pressure of the soil specimen was 
provided by a digital oil pressure/volume device. A 
computer with Labview program and an integrated 
indicator is used to record and monitor the pore 
water pressure, pore-air pressure, and the volumes 
of the inflow and outflow water. 
 
2.3  Air diffusion 
The application and measurement of pore air 
pressure is complicated by the tendency of air to 
diffuse into the pore water and through the rubber 
membrane. Dunn (1965) shown that the diffusion 
through the pore water and rubber membrane was 
greatly reduced when the specimen was enclosed in 
two rubber membranes with slotted aluminium 
sheet separated by a layer of silicon grease between 
the membrane. The aluminium sheet was slotted 
vertically so that they would not add strength to the 
soil specimen. In this study, we used Dunn 
(1965)’s method in the triaxial permeability test to 
prevent diffusion of pore air through the rubber 
membrane. 
 
 
3. TEST PROCEDURES 
Soil specimen obtained using a thin  tube sampler 
was trimmed into 5.0cm diameter and about 7.0cm 
high in an environment where changes in moisture 
content are minimized. It was then mounted on the 
triaxial pedestal. The permeameter cell is then 
filled with water and connected to the confining 
pressure, back pressure (upper and lower) and air 
pressure. 
The soil specimen was isotropically consolidated 
to the desired net normal stress (σc-ua), and matric 
suction (ua-uw) where σc denotes the applied 
confining pressure, and ua and uw represent the 
applied pore-air and pore-water pressures, 
respectively. The axis-translation technique (Hilf, 
1956) forms the basis for the laboratory testing of 
unsaturated soils with high matric suction 
(Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993). The axis-
translation technique, which involves a translation 
of the referenced to a positive air pressure and the 
pore water pressure can then referenced to a 
positive pressure, is commonly used in the 
laboratory testing of unsaturated soils in order to 
prevent having to measure pore water pressures 
less than zero absolute (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 
1993). 
 
Figure 3.  A typical plot of water inflow and 
outflow achieving steady-state condition. 
 
 
The consolidation process was deemed to be 
complete when there was negligible water flow 
either in to or out of the soil specimen. The net 
confining stress was maintained at a constant value 
since only the relationships between the coefficient 
of permeability and matric suction were examined. 
The water coefficient of permeability was 
determined after the unsaturated consolidation 
stage was completed. Constant-head method was 
used to determine the unsaturated coefficient of 
permeability in this study. The hydraulic gradient 
was applied by reducing the upper back water 
pressure and increasing the lower back water 
pressure such that the difference was equal to the 
pressure corresponding to the desired hydraulic 
gradient. The water inflow and outflow were 
continuously monitored by the digital 
pressure/volume controller until a steady-state 
condition was established when the inflow rate was 
approximately equal the out flow rate. A typical 
plot of steady state condition is shown in Figure 3.  
After the steady-stage condition was established, 
the water coefficient of permeability was then 
calculated using Darcy’s law (Richards 1931; 
Childs and Collis-George 1950; and Fredlund and 
Rahardjo 1993). As the coefficient of permeability 
of the high air entry ceramic disks may affect the 
determination of the water coefficient of 
permeability of the soil specimen, the impedance of 
the ceramic disks must be taken into account. The 
unsaturated water coefficient of permeability of the 
soil specimen kw should be determined by treating 
the disk-soil-disk arrangement as a three-layer 
system using the following equation (Leong and 
Rahardjo, 1997): 
3rd Asian Conf. on Unsaturated Soils, Nanjing, China, 21-23 April 2007. 
 
 473 
used hydraulic gradient ranging from 30 to 140 and 
their results indicates that the magnitude of the 
coefficient of permeability of specimen is not 
sensitive to the magnitude of hydraulic gradients 
used especially at high matric suction, and that the 
Darcy’s law can be applied. Although an 
excessively high hydraulic gradient is not 
advisable, the use of a low hydraulic gradient when 
measuring very low coefficient of permeability is 
not desirable either since the relationship between 
flow rate and hydraulic gradient becomes nonlinear 
and therefore Darcy’s low is no longer valid 
(Hansbo, 1960). Hence, in this study we applied a 
hydraulic gradient of 100 for unsaturated 
permeability tests. 
Figure 5 shows the relationship of volumetric 
water content and matric suction obtained from 
unsaturated permeability test. As the matric suction 
was reduced from 700 to 0 kPa the volumetric 
water content increases.

Figure 6 shows the results of the water 
coefficient of permeability obtained from this 
series of test. The figure shows that the water 
coefficient of permeability does not change 
significantly at low matric suction value (< 50 
kPa). However, for matric suction greater than 50 
kPa, the coefficient of permeability decreases 
rapidly. In addition, it can be seen that at a 
particular matric suction value the water coefficient 
of permeability reduces as the net normal stress 
increases, which is plausible because the soil is 
getting more compact at higher net normal stress. 
It should be noted that there are some difficulties 
associated with the steady-state method. The main 
difficulty arises from the low coefficient of 
permeability of the soil. A very long time is 
required to complete a test; as a result air diffusion 
through the water and water loss from the 
permeameter may affect the final result (Fredlund 
and Rahardjo, 1993). 
 
 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
The above results indicate that the modified 
triaxial permeameter system can be used to 
measure the water coefficient of permeability of 
unsaturated lateritic soils that ranged between 10-13 
m/s at a matric suction of 700 kPa to as high as 10-
10
 m/s at a matric suction of 0 kPa. The range of 
coefficient of permeability that can be measured 
using the triaxial permeameter system is limited by 
the permeability of the high  air ceramic disk used. 
The lower limit of the coefficient of permeability 
obtained using the triaxial permeameter system will 
be limited by the coefficient of permeability of the 
high air entry ceramic disks and Fredlund and 
Rahardjo (1993) suggested that the coefficient of 
permeability of the ceramic disk should be two 
orders of the magnitude higher than the 
permeability of the soil to be measured. 
The permeameter system also enables the total 
volume change of the specimen to be measured 
during unsaturated consolidation.
