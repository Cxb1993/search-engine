Abstract
This research studies production process with random yields under multiple produc-
tion settings and the product downward substitution environment. The purpose is to ﬁnd
out the quantity of production setting used in each period. The problem is modeled as a
stochastic linear programming. Two heuristics are proposed to solve the problem. The
ﬁrst heuristics is called TRS (Time Reduced Scenarios) that considers complete yield sce-
narios in ﬁrst few periods and then scenarios are reduced in following periods. The second
heuristics is called IS (Importance Sampling) that uses importance sampling method to
pick out yield scenarios which have higher eﬀect on the objective function. The results
of experiment prove that two heuristics can both solve problems eﬃciently.
Key words: random yield, downward substitution, production planning, stochastic pro-
gramming, importance sampling.
1 Introduction
Advances in the LED (Lighting Emitting Diode) technology makes the production of LED
grains with wider spectrum and brighter color possible and thus more articles include LED in
their designs. As better LED grains emerge, customers set stricter speciﬁcations for the LED
grains: brighter LED grains with narrower wavelength range speciﬁcation. The wavelength
and brightness of LED grains produced are determined by both the raw material used and
the production machine setting of LED production machine, Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor
Deposition (MOCVD). The LED grains production process is a co-production process where
several products (grains of diﬀerent wavelength) are produced simultaneously. The brightness

computational extensive. In the following, two heuristics are proposed to ﬁnd the most im-
portant decision variables of practical concern: kst, proportion of production capacity set in
setting s in period t.
2.1 Time Reduced Scenarios Heuristic, TRS
Bitran and Dasu[1992] proposed a heuristic to solve the mulitiperiod stochastic yields ordering
problem with discrete random variables. In their heuristic, period 1 includes all scenarios
of discrete random yields in the LP model , and for periods 2 and on, random yields are
replaced by their means in the LP model. The time reduced scenarios, TRS, is similar to
Bitran and Dasu[1992]. Since random yields in our problem are continuous, we need to
discretize them ﬁrst. In period 1, a ﬁne grid discretization of random yields are used, in
period 2, a less ﬁne grid discretization of random yields are used, as periods go on larger
and larger grid discretization are applied. After the discretization, the extensive form of
the stochastic program with discretized random variables is formed and the problem is then
solved by commercial LP solver.
2.2 Importance Sampling Heuristic, IS
The sequence of decision variables of a multistage stochastic problem are determined as
follows: the ﬁrst stage decision variables (ks1 in our problem) are chosen, then the random
events happen (for our problem, they are random yields in the ﬁrst period). Depending on
the realization of the random events, the second stage decision variables (ks2 in our problem)
are chosen, then the second stage random events happen (they are random yields in the
second period in our problem). The process continues in this manner until we determine all
stages of decision variables (Birge and Louveraux 1997). To ﬁnd the optimal solution, let us
take a two-stage stochastic problem for example, when one determines the ﬁrst stage decision
variables, one needs to consider all possible realizations of the random events. Under risk-
neutral assumption, the impacts of second stage decision variables on the objective value can
be expressed by its expectation, which is a function of ﬁrst stage decision variable. (See Birge
and Louveraux 1997). The diﬃculties lie in evaluating the expectation (the integration). The
idea of importance sampling is to change the probability to make the evaluation of integration
easier. As stated by Glynn and Iglehart 1989, when calculating I =

decision variables in the objective function by dividing its objective coeﬃcients by q.
The truncated extensive form is as follows:

I−ωi0 = 0 ω ∈ Ωq, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1
0 ≤ Y ωjit ≤ I−ωjt ω ∈ Ωq, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, j = i + 1, . . . , N − 1, t = 1, 2, . . . , T
kst ≥ 0; Xωsit ≥ 0; I+ωit ≥ 0; I−ωit ≥ 0
ω ∈ Ωq, s = 1, 2, . . .S, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, t = 1, 2, . . . , T
Obviously, the closer the value of q to 1, the better the solution and the longer the computation
time required to ﬁnd the optimal solution of the truncated extensive form.
2.3 Numerical studies
The production problem we considered in the numerical studies consists of two production
setting, two products with defective items (product 3) and four production periods. Assume
that the marginal yield of a product under setting s , Ps is Beta(α, β) distributed. Since
the size of the problem grows exponentially as the number of scenarios that a yield random
variable has increases. Because of limited computer memory size, based on several numerical
test examples, we set the number of scenarios that a yield random variable can represent
for as four. We discretize Ps by (1) divide [0,1] into four subintervals [ak, bk], k = 1, 2, 3, 4 :
{[0, 0.25], [0.25, 0.5], [0.5, 0.75], [0.75, 1]} (2) Compute the representative value of interval k,

of product is product 1:0.25, product 2:0.5 and product 3:0.25. Case 3: Production setting
1: yield of product is distributed as Uniform(0,1), Production setting 2: yield of product is
product 1:0.25, product 2:0.5 and product 3:0.25.
To evaluate the performance of heuristics proposed, we design two measures:
Average objective value closeness
= 1− Average objective value from the heuristic-Average optimal objective valueAverage optimal objective value
Average reduction in computation time
= 1−Average computation time of the optimal solution-Average computation time of heuristicAverage computation time of the optimal solution
The following table is the numerical results we obtained .
Production setting 1: Beta(4.7,2) Optimal TRS IS
Average objective value 23,922.82 23,929.07 23,927.68
Average objective value closeness 99.974% 99.980%
Average reduction in computation time 98.07% 96.13 %
Production setting 1: Beta(2,2) Optimal TRS IS
Average objective value 29,903.54 29,912.21 29,905.28
Average objective value closeness 99.971% 99.994%
Average reduction in computation time 97.26% 81.17%
Production setting 1: Beta(2,2) Optimal TRS IS
Average objective value 30,542.21 30,550.62 30,699.23
Average objective value closeness 99.972% 99.486%
Average reduction in computation time 98.39% 55.01%
From the results, it’s obvious both heuristics performs quite well in terms of average ob-
jective value closeness. On the computation time aspect TRS has better performance than
IS.

Abstract
Properly administrated arrival process can eﬀectively
reduce jobs ﬂow times and make companies deliver
their goods to customers quicker and become more
competitive in the market. This paper models the
manufacturer as an M/M/1 queue which is suscepti-
ble to a cumulative shock failure process and studies
the optimal admission policy for such a system. As-
suming that the server is minimally repaired when
it fails and can be pre- ventively maintained at the
ends of busy periods, the optimal admission policy of
this unreliable queue is of control-limit-type and the
optimal admission control limit is such that the con-
troller rejects mo arrival when the state of the server
deteriorates more.
Keywords: Admission Control; Control-limit Pol-
icy, Markov Decision Processes
1 Introduction
There are many studies on the admission control of a
service station in the literature. Among them, some
exercise the control by rejecting or accepting an ar-
rival at its arrival epoch, such as Rue and Rosenshine
(1981), and Blanc and et al. (1992). Some control the
system by modulating the arrival rate, such as Lipp-
man (1975), and Serfozo (1981). Some control by
routing the arrivals to diﬀerent service facilities such
as Rykov (2001). Some control by adjusting the tolls
levied on the arrivals such as Chen and Frank (2001).
If the arrival process is controlled by accepting or re-
jecting an arrival at its arrival epoch, the optimal pol-
icy is to accept the arrival when the number of jobs in
the system is less than a critical number, and to reject
the arrival, otherwise. All the studies above assume
that the service station does not fail. Obviously, this
assumption does not hold in real applications. As-
sume that the state of the server deteriorates with
usage and eventually fails. Failures of a server are
caused by a cumulative shock process imposing on
the server while the server is busy. Each shock brings
in an independently and identically distributed (iid)
amount of damage to the server and the damages are
cumulative. When the cumulated damage to a server
exceeds a random threshold, the server fails. When
a server fails, it is minimally repaired. The minimal
repair restores the state of the server to the state just
before it fails. Our goal is to ﬁnd an optimal admis-
sion control policy at jobs arrival epochs by accept-
ing or rejecting arriving job; and an optimal server
preventive maintenance policy at the ends of busy
periods to restores the state of the server to good
as new state. The objective is to minimize the to-
tal expected discounted cost. The problem of ﬁnding
the optimal policy is formulated as a Markov deci-
sion process (MDP). Under the assumptions that the
system incurs a convex, nondecreasing holding cost
rate, ﬁxed operating and repair cost rates, a failure
cost at failure epoch and a reward at service com-
pletion, we prove that the optimal admission policy
is of control-limit type when the terminal cost func-
tion of the MDP is nondecreasing in the state of the
server and convex in the number of jobs in the sys-
tem. Furthermore, when the terminal cost function
is submodular, then, as the state of the server gets
worse, the optimal policy rejects more arrivals. The
rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
is the detailed description of the system. Section 3
proves the that the optimal policy is of control limit
type. Section 4 concludes the paper.
2 System Description
Consider an M/M/1 queue with a Poisson jobs ar-
rival process of rate λ and exponentially distributed
service times of mean 1/μ. Assume that when pro-
cessing jobs, the server is subject to a cumulative
shock process. The shock stream of the cumulative
1
epochs, the decision maker can choose (1) accepting
the arrival or (2) rejecting the arrivals. The MDP
state is deﬁned as (0, k, d) at the ends of busy peri-
ods; the corresponding actions for the decision maker
are (1) to turn oﬀ the arrival process and to conduct
preventive maintenance on the server (2) not to in-
terfere with the system.
Consider the problem in ﬁnite time horizon. When
there are n transitions epochs remaining, deﬁne
Vn(m, k, a), Vn(m, k, f, a), Vn(m, k), and Vn(m, k, f)
as the optimal cost-to-go functions when the states
are (m, k, a), (m, k, f, a), (m, k) and (m, k, f), respec-
tively. Pn(0, k) is the optimal cost-to-go function
when the state is (0, k, d) and we choose to turn oﬀ the
arrival process and perform preventive maintenance
on the server; and Nn(0, k) is the optimal cost-to-go
function when the state is (0, k, d) and we choose not
to interfere with the system. Let the discount rate be
α and deﬁne a period as the time between two con-
secutive transition epochs. Then one period discount
factor becomes

e−αtΛe−Λtdt = Λ/(α + Λ). Let
c(m, k) be the one period discounted cost when the
state is (m, k),

To exclude the uninteresting case where the system
eventually remains empty forever, we assume that the
parameters of the system are such that the arriving
jobs which ﬁnd the system are empty are always ac-
cepted. The dynamic recursions of the problem in
ﬁnite time horizon are ∀m ≥ 1; k = 0, 1, 2 . . . , n ≥ 1

Let us consider the decisions regarding conducting
preventive maintenance on the server at the ends of
busy periods ﬁrst. By the expression of Pn(0, k),
Pn(0, k) is independent of k. It can be easily proved
that Vn(m, k) is nondecreasing in k for all n by in-
duction if V0(m, k) and V0(m, k, f) are nondecreasing
in k. Thus Pn(0, k)− Nn(0, k) is nonincreasing in k
and we have
Proposition 1 If V0(m, k) and V0(m, k, f) are non-
decreasing in k, then there exists a k(n) such that
Vn(0, k, d) =
{
Pn(0, k) if k ≥ k(n)
Nn(0, k) if k < k(n)
That is when there are n transition epochs remain-
ing and the state is (0, k, d), we conduct preventive
maintenance on the server only when k ≥ k(n). To
derive the optimal admission control policy, we need
a result from Lippman and Stidham(1977):
Lemma 1 If f(x) is a convex function on integers,
then g(x) = min{f(x+1), f(x)} is also a convex func-
tion
Applying this lemma and the convexity of h(m),
by induction, it can be easily proved that Vn(m, k)
and Vn(m, k, f) are convex in m if V0(m, k) and
V0(m, k, f) are convex in m. Hence, the optimal ad-
mission policy of this problem is of control limit type
as stated in the following.

Now follow the same steps as used before we
can prove vn+1(m, k + 1, a) ≥ vn+1(m, k, a),
vn+1(m, k, f, a) ≥ vn+1(m, k, a) and vn+1(m, k +
1, f, a) ≥ vn+1(m, k, f, a) and by induction we have
vn+1(m, k + 1, f) ≥ vn+1(m, k, f). 
Proposition 4 If V0(m, k) and V0(m, k, f) are con-
vex in m for fixed k and the server continues to serve
the jobs remaining in the system at the end of hori-
zon until the system is empty, then mnk and m

nonincreasing in n.
proof : By induction. 
4 Conclusion
In this paper we study the admission control of a
unreliable M/M/1 queue where server failures are
caused by a cumulative shock process imposing on
the server. The state of the server deteriorates as
number of shocks it experiences increases. Similar
to the optimal policy of an M/M/1 queue in perpet-
ual up state , the optimal policy of this deteriorating
M/M/1 queue is also of control limit type under the
assumption that the system incurs a convex, nonde-
creasing holding cost rate and the terminal cost func-
tion of the MDP is nondecreasing in the state of the
server and convex in the number of jobs in the sys-
tem. Furthermore, when the terminal cost function
is submodular, then, as the state of the server gets
worse, the optimal policy rejects more arrivals. This
result prescribes us to modify our admission rejection
criterion as the state of server changes and conﬁrms
the intuition that we should operate the system more
conservatively when the state of a server is getting
worse.
