開發可以供臨床醫療使用的生物組織，一直是組織工程研究領域的一項挑戰。在傳統的組織工程策
略上，細胞被植種於三維的細胞鷹架”體”中，然後經長時間培養於生物反應器中，進而生成新生組織。
然而，該組織工程方法常導致組織內部結構不易控制，其原因可能是不均勻的細胞植種、質傳上的限
制或是其它因素所致。除此之外，真實的生物組織，其內部有一定的結構及組成特性，這些複雜的生
物組織特性，與其生物功能有密切關係。因此，為了培養出具有功能性的生物組織，操控生物組織的
內部結構是一件重要的工作。然而，現今的組織工程策略，尚無法在體外建構出具有特殊結構及組成
特性的生物組織。有別於以”整體”為觀點的傳統組織工程方法，所謂 Bottom-up 組織工程概念被提出
來，其主要策略係以小型的組織培養物為模組單元，去建構複雜的體外組織結構物。特別是近年來，
一些以 Bottom-up 組織工程策略為基礎的組織工程方法被提出，然而，大部份的這些方法，尚無法精
確地操控生物組織的內部結構。為了克服現階段組織工程遇到的困難，吾人實驗室提出一項能精確調
控組織培養物內部結構的組織工程策略，該方法為利用包埋細胞的微型水膠體顆粒為模組單元，去組
合成具有特殊結構及成份特性之組織培養物。吾人實驗室在前一年度國科會研究計畫的支持下，已開
發一項可調式、操作簡易及細胞友善的微流體式海藻膠微珠製備系統，並且成功利用它來製造包埋關
節軟骨細胞的水膠體顆粒。在本年度的研究計畫中，我們開發了一項微流體組織培養平台，在該平台
內，我們利用光介電泳力現象，去操控包埋細胞的水膠體顆粒，藉此去組合成具有特殊結構特性之組
織培養物。為了驗證其可行性，本研究中，我們展示關節軟骨組織工程。首先，我們利用前述的微流
體式海藻膠微珠製備系統，製造包埋關節軟骨細胞的微型水膠體顆粒。接下來，我們基礎性地探討在
不同的操作條件下，光介電泳力的產生情形，以協助本研究選定適當的操作條件，實驗結果發現，光
介電泳力現象會隨著所施加的電壓及水膠體顆粒內的細胞數量增加而增大，然而，光介電泳力產生的
大小與所操控的水膠體顆粒大小無關。在關節軟骨組織工程的展示部分，在微流體組織培養平台內，
我們利用光介電泳力，去排列及組合三種不同細胞密度的水膠體顆粒，所形成的片狀組織培養物，其
內部細胞密度分佈模擬關節軟骨縱切面的細胞密度分佈。更進一步，我們將四片此種片狀組織培養物
堆疊，以組合成較大的組織培養物，最後，我們使用共軛焦顯微鏡去觀察組織培養物內的細胞分佈情
形，實驗證明，我們可以利用此方法去建構與關節軟骨內部細胞密度相似之體外組織培養物。此外，
組合而成的組織培養物，可以直接於該平台中進行長期的灌流式組織培養。整體而言，本研究整合微
流體及光介電泳技術於組織工程的研究領域上，本研究提出的新組織工程方法，期待能克服傳統組織
工程所遭遇的瓶頸。

2-1 Introduction 
Successful tissue engineering substantially relies on a controllable manner to culture tissue in terms of its 
structure [1]. Conventional tissue engineering, however, generally employs a “top-down” approach, by which 
an intact scaffold biomaterial is seeded with cells and subsequently cultured in a bioreactor system. Tissue 
engineering based on this approach normally produces a neo-tissue with uncontrollable inner structural 
properties. This outcome may be attributable to poorly-defined cell seeding, mass transfer limitations, or other 
factors. In addition, animal tissues normally have inherently unique tissue architectures that are biologically 
meaningful to their tissue functions. For example, articular cartilage is a virtually non-homogenous tissue in 
which three different zones (superficial, transitional, and radial) can be defined; each zone varies in the 
distribution of the matrix components and the cell density of the articular chondrocytes [2]. This distinct 
feature plays an important role in determining the biomechanical function of articular cartilage [3]. Thus far, 
however, the structural characteristics of native cartilage have not been adequately mimicked by the current 
tissue engineering approaches [4]. 
In the hope of producing an engineered tissue construct with a tunable architecture, the concept of 
“bottom-up tissue engineering” [5], by which an entire engineered tissue construct is fabricated by the 
assembly of modular building blocks (e.g., cell-encapsulated microparticles), holds immense promise. The 
key advantage behind this approach is that the inner structure of an engineered tissue construct can be tailored 
by assembling the building blocks with various properties (e.g., cell species, cell density, or extracellular 
matrix (ECM)) to create a neo-tissue in a bottom-up manner. Although some pioneering studies have been 
successfully demonstrated, the utilisation of such an emerging strategy has not yet set into motion a 
progressive shift from the conventional methods of tissue engineering. This is primarily due to the lack of an 
efficient approach that is user-friendly and allows the biologist to manipulate the modular units and assemble 
them into a desirable engineered culture construct in a manageable manner.  
The manipulation of biological cells and microparticles has attracted considerable interest for various 
biological applications. The recent progress in microfluidic technology has provided new opportunities to 
manipulate such small-scale substances. Reports in the literature have successfully demonstrated the 
manipulation of cells and microparticles in microfluidic systems for diverse applications such as cell sorting 
[6], cell patterning [7], cell isolation [8], cell counting [9], and various types of microparticle handling [10-11]. 
More recently, the integration of optically-induced dielectrophoretic (ODEP) force-based techniques into 
microfluidic systems has created an efficient method for manipulating biological cells and microparticles. The 
ODEP force-based technique integrates a commercial projector image and photoconductive material to 
produce a nonuniform electric field that is used to manipulate electrically polarised microparticles [12]. Based 
on this approach, microparticles and cells can be simply manipulated by the optical images that are 
illuminated on the photoconductive layer. The utilisation of ODEP forces in microfluidic systems has been 
successfully achieved to manipulate microparticles [13], cells [14], biomolecules [15], and nanoscale particles 
[16]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the application of this technique in tissue engineering has not 
yet been proposed.  
In this study, the ODEP force mechanism for the fine manipulation of cell-encapsulating alginate 
microbeads was incorporated into a microfluidic tissue culture platform for bottom-up cartilage tissue 
engineering. In this work, a microfluidic tissue culture platform that is capable of providing ODEP force was 
 6 
was used to display controllable optical images onto the photoconductive material to generate ODEP force. 
The overall experimental setup is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.  
2-2-2  Microfabrication 
The overall fabrication process was based on photolithography using SU-8 photoresist (MicroChem, 
USA), thin film technology using sputtering and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), and 
the epoxy glue-aided bonding process. In this study, the top and middle layers were fabricated by standard 
photolithography methods. For the bottom glass substrate, a 70-nm-thick ITO was sputtered onto a cleaned 
dummy glass and treated with a thermal annealing process (240 
o
C, 60 min). A 10-nm-thick molybdenum 
metal layer was then sputtered onto the ITO layer. Based on the PECVD process, a 1-μm-thick amorphous 
silicon layer was deposited onto the treated ITO glass. The SU-8 microfabricated ITO glass substrate (top and 
middle layers) and the treated bottom glass substrate were then bonded with an epoxy glue to form a 
microfluidic system as illustrated in Fig. 1.  
 
2-2-3  The evaluation of the manipulation force  
In this study, the appropriate conditions under which to generate the manipulation force for the control of 
cell-encapsulating alginate microbeads were experimentally investigated based on a previous study [18] in 
which Stokes’ law was used to evaluate the ODEP force. Stokes’ law describes the drag force (F) that is 
exerted on a spherical particle in a continuous flow condition and can be expressed as equation 1.  
6F r v  (1) 
where r, η, and v denote the radius of the microbead, the viscosity of the fluid, and the terminal velocity of the 
microbead, respectively. In this study, the cell-encapsulating alginate microbeads were manipulated in the 
rectangular microchamber in which the friction between the alginate microbeads and the inner surfaces of the 
microchamber could not be ignored. As a result, the manipulation force was defined as the net force of the 
generated ODEP force and the friction force that occurred during operation. The manipulation force was 
assumed to be equal to the drag force that was exerted on the moving microbead. At a given microbead size 
and viscosity of the surrounding medium, the manipulation force generated under a specific operating 
condition can be estimated from the terminal velocity of the microbead. The terminal velocity is defined as the 
maximum velocity of a moving light pattern that can manipulate the microbead. In this study, the 
manipulation forces generated under various conditions of applied electric voltage (4 to 10 V), with 
chondrocyte-encapsulating alginate microbeads of different cell densities (7.7×10
6
 to 5×10
7
 cells ml
-1
) and 
alginate microbeads that varied in size (diameter: 80 to 160 μm), were experimentally quantified. 
 
2-2-4  The manipulation and assembly of chondrocyte-encapsulating alginate microbeads  
To imitate the cell distribution in native articular cartilage, chondrocyte-encapsulating alginate 
microbeads with various cell densities (2.4× 10
7
, 1.0×10
7
, and 7.7×10
6
 cells ml
-1
) were sequentially loaded 
into the microfluidic tissue culture platform in a volumetric ratio of 1:1:8 (alginate microbeads). For the 
manipulation and assembly of the loaded cell-containing alginate microbeads, an AC voltage (10 V and 
50-kHz frequency) was used to create an electric field in the microfluidic system. After the loaded 
cell-encapsulating alginate microbeads were sorted, separated, and finally packed, 3 μl of agarose suspension 
was loaded into the rectangular microchamber through capillary force to fix the patterned alginate microbeads.

ODEP force. Therefore, the higher manipulation force that was observed on the alginate microbeads with the 
higher number of encapsulated cells (Fig. 5 (b)) may be due to the additive effect of the ODEP forces exerted 
on the cells. To investigate the size effect of the microbeads on the manipulation force, the forces required to 
manipulate the cell-free microbeads of various sizes were measured. The results (Fig. 5 (c)) showed that under 
the same operating conditions, the manipulation forces that were generated were independent of the size of the 
microbeads (p>0.05, ANOVA). This finding was not in line with equation 2, in which the ODEP force is 
proportional to the radius of the microbeads cubed. Microbeads of larger sizes can theoretically experience a 
higher ODEP force. Nevertheless, the larger microbeads may also experience a higher degree of frictional 
force due to the relatively higher degree of the contact area and normal force. Consequently, the results (Fig. 5 
(c)) observed in this study could be the compromise between the two factors discussed. Based on the 
fundamental investigation, overall, it can be reasonably speculated that the frictional force may play an 
important role in determining the ODEP force, particularly under a positive ODEP force and the alginate 
hydrogel particle model. It might not be appropriate to employ the conventional DEP model to describe the 
ODEP force experienced by the alginate microparticles. 
 
2-3-2 The manipulation and assembly of chondrocyte-encapsulating alginate microbeads for bottom-up 
cartilage tissue engineering  
In this study, articular cartilage tissue engineering was demonstrated to show the feasibility of utilising the 
proposed system for bottom-up tissue engineering. Within the cartilage tissue, the superficial, transitional 
(middle), and radial (deep) zones exhibit variations in cell density, cell morphology, matrix biochemical 
composition, and organisation as a function of depth [2]. Such unique heterogeneities of the cartilage structure 
contribute to its biological function to resist and distribute mechanical load [3]. In this work, alginate 
microbeads with three different encapsulated cell densities of 2.4×10
7
, 1.0×10
7
, or 7.7×10
6
 cells ml
-1
 that 
mimic the cell densities in the three defined (superficial, transitional, and radial, respectively) zones of 
articular cartilage [2] were prepared. The prepared alginate microbeads with the encapsulated cell densities of 
2.4×10
7
, 1.0×10
7
, or 7.7×10
6
 cells ml
-1
 were sequentially loaded into the microfluidic tissue culture platform 
in a volumetric ratio of 1:1:8 that imitates the ratio of the superficial, transitional, and radial zones in native 
adult human cartilage [2]. Loading was followed by the manipulation and assembly of these cell-containing 
alginate microbeads by using ODEP force. The assembled cell culture construct was then cultured on site 
under a mild medium perfusion setting for up to 4 days. After cell culture, fluorescent dye staining and 
microscopic observation were carried out to examine the cell viability. Fig. 6 (a) not only reveals that the 
viability of the cultured cells remained as high as 95±2%, but it also demonstrates that the patterned alginate 
microbeads and thus the cell distribution were not perturbed by the medium perfusion. In this study, the 
dimensions of the assembled cell culture construct were 2.40 mm × 1.75 mm × 80 μm (length, width, and 
height, respectively). In this study, four sheet-like cell culture constructs were stacked to create a larger cell 
culture construct assembly (L: 2.40 mm, W: 1.75 mm, H: 320 μm). Fig. 6 (b) shows the 3-D confocal 
microscopy images in which the construct with chondrocyte cell densities that mimic the three defined zones 
of native articular cartilage [2] were fabricated. As a whole, the presented demonstration case showed that the 
proposed system was capable of conducting bottom-up tissue engineering in a precise, manageable, and 
especially user-friendly manner.
