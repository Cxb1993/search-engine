Abstract: Process capability indices (PCIs) have been proposed in the manufacturing
industry to provide numerical measures on process capability, which are effective tools
for quality assurance and guidance for process improvement. PCIs are calculated under
the assumption that the process is stable (the process mean and variation will not
change). But, in practice, the process is dynamic. If the process parameters have a small
shift, the control chart not be able to detect immediately. PCIs, in this case, will
overestimate the true process capability. For this reason, the PCIs have to be adjusted.
Bothe (2002) provided the adjustment method for normal processes with mean shift. In
practice, the variance could change as well. In this project, we provide capability
adjustment for normal processes with standard deviation change. The magnitude of
adjustment is correlated to the detection power of the control chart used. We first
investigate the detection powers of 2S and S control charts under various sample
subgroup sizes, and derive the magnitude of the adjustment. We add the adjustment to
the formula of process capability index Cpk for normal processes. For illustration purpose,
an application example is presented.
Keywords: Dynamic Cpk, Variance change, Process capability index, Normal distribution,

1. Introduction
Process capability indices are important for any successful quality
improvement activities and quality program implementation. They have been
the focus of recent research in quality assurance and process capability analysis.
Process capability indices establish the relationship between the actual
performance and the manufacturing specifications, which provide management
with a single-number summary of the process capability in a format that is easy
to use and understand. Thus, the capability indices have been widely used in the
manufacturing industry. The two basic, most commonly used indices for
assessing process potential and performance, Cp and Cpk were discussed in Kane
(1986). The more advanced index Cpm was formalized by Chan et al. (1988) to
offset the weakness of the first-generation indices, taking the target value of the
process into account. The third-generation index Cpmk was introduced by Pearn et
al. (1992), which is more restrictive regarding to process mean deviation from the
target value than the other two indices. Those PCIs defined as:

causes that result in large shifts in the monitored parameters. Nevertheless, a
major disadvantage of a Shewhart control chart is that it uses only the
information about the process contained in the last sample observation and it
ignores any information given by the entire sequence of points. This feature
makes the Shewhart control chart relatively insensitive to small process shift.
This potentially makes Shewhart control charts less useful in phase II monitoring
problems, where the process tends to operate in control, reliable estimates of the
process parameters (such as the mean and standard deviation) are available, and
assignable causes do not typically result in large process upsets or disturbances.
This is demonstrated in Table 1, displays the probabilities of detecting changes in
 versus subgroup size for shift 0.5(0.1)3 with 3, 4 and 5n  . The
probabilities of detecting small shifts in  are close to zero. As the size of the
shift increases, so does the detection power of the X control chart to detect it,
with sample subgroup sizes 3, 4 and 5n  eventually close to 100 percent for
shifts in excess of 3.

In studying the properties of control charts, the emphasis has been on
determining the detection power and ARL (Average Run Length) of the chart.
The ARL of a chart is the expected number of samples to be taken before the
chart detects a shift in the process characteristic. The ARL should be large when
there has been no change in the process, but the ARL should be small when the
process having undergone a change. The value of the ARL is depending on the
purpose being studied. For any Shewshart control chart, we have noted that the
ARL can also be expressed as

for the out-of-control 1ARL , where  is the probability of detecting a shift
when none has occurred, and  is the probability of failing to detect a real shift
in process characteristic. In general, we set 1 2ARL  in most applications.
Therefore, the detection power is

idea is to use appropriate quantiles of the process distribution, x0.00135 and x0.99865,
to define a quantile-based PCIs. Good discussions of these approaches are in
Kotz and Lovelace (1998).
Hsu et al. (2007) examine Bothe’s study and find the detection power was 
less than 0.5 when data came from Gamma distributions, showing that Bothe’s 
statistical rationales are inadequate when we had Gamma processes. Then, Hsu
et al. (2007) calculate the magnitude of adjustments which called 50AS under
various sample subgroup sizes n and Gamma parameter N , with power fixed to
0.5. Table 3 displays the magnitude of adjustments 50AS which Hsu et al.
provided and data come from Gamma( ,1)N with various values of N =1(1)10
and n =2(1)6.

3. Normal Process
Normal process is applicable in many fields. Many phenomena generate
random variables with probability distributions that are very well approximated
by normal distribution. In this chapter, we introduce normal distribution and the
sampling distributions of the statistics.
3.1. Normal Distribution
Undoubtedly, the most widely used model for the distribution of a random

3.2. Statistics and Sampling Distributions
An important sampling distribution defined in terms of normal distribution
is the Chi-square or 2 distribution. Let 1 2, , ......, nX X X are normally and

The Chi-square random variable with df n is denoted by 2n . The
Chi-square distribution is a continuous asymmetrical theoretical probability
distribution. The Chi-square value must fall within the range 20  , and
thus can never be a negative number. The coefficient of skewness and kurtosis of

3.3. Point Estimation of Normal Processes Parameters
Suppose that the variance 2 and standard deviation  of normal
distribution are both unknown. If a random sample of n observations is taken,
then the sample variance 2S and sample standard deviation 4/S c are point
estimators of the population variance 2 and population standard deviation ,
respectively. It can be shown that

4. Process Variance Change Investigation for Normal Processes Using
2S
Control Chart
The major purpose of individuals control chart is assisting on identifying
shifts and drifts in processes and it is easily to be implemented. But some
assumptions should be satisfied before control charts are used. The assumptions
include that the process must in stationary. In practice, process is not stable. Due
to above-mentioned statements, the steps in calculating the probabilities for
catching various magnitude of change under various sample subgroup sizes n of
2S control chart are as followings.
4.1. Detection Power of 2S Control Chart for Normal Processes
STEP 1: Construct the limits. The parameters of the 2S control chart are

One way to improve the odds of catching small changes in  is to increase
the sample subgroup size. The chance of detecting a 33.4 percent when 15n  , to
almost 43 percent when 19n  . However, this chance falls to only 21.1 percent if
10n  .
4.2. Modified Variance Adjustments for Normal Processes
The probabilities in Table 5 are plotted on the graph displayed in Figure 4,
with one curve for each sample subgroup size. Those curves are power curves,
these lines portray the chances of detecting a change in standard deviation of a
given size (expressed in  units on the horizontal axis). For small change in
standard deviation, all three curves are close to zero. As the size of the change
increases, so does the detection power of the chart, with all three curves
eventually leveling off close to 100% for shifts exceeding 3.5. The horizontal
lines in Figure 4 show that there is a 50% chance of missing a 1.72 change in
standard deviation when 12n  for 2S control chart, whereas  must move
by 1.80 to have this same probability when 10n  .
Figure 4. Power curves of 2S control chart for subgroup sizes 10, 11 and 12.
The necessary adjustment due to the undetected standard deviation change
is called powerAS which is the magnitude of change we need to adjust based on
designated detection power and process data come from normal distributions.
We develop a Matlab program to determine the adjustment powerAS by setting
the desired detection power and the sample subgroup size n. Generally, the
sample subgroup size of 2S and S control charts is moderately

Change in standard deviation expressed in  units
likely to remain undetected (larger moves should be caught by the chart), a
conservative approach is to assume that every missed change is as large as
powerAS .
Since changes can move standard deviation larger or smaller, in place of
using ˆ for the process variance when estimating capability, ˆ multiplied by
powerAS is a conservative way to evaluate the process capability. The adjustment
is incorporated into the pkC formula, which we refer to as “dynamic” pkC
index, by making the following modifications:

By including an adjustment in this assessment for undetected shifts in variance,
the estimate of capability will decrease and the expected total number
nonconforming parts will increase. To illustrates the use of dynamic pkC index,
setting the detection power 0.5 of 2S control chart. Then 1.63powerAS  (see
Table 6) when 15n  from normal distribution. Factoring in the possibility
missing changes in  of up to 1.63 drops the pkC index.
5. Process Variance Change Investigation for Normal Processes Using S
Control Chart
Most quality engineers use either 2S control chart or the S control chart
to monitor process variability. In this chapter, we exhibit the detection powers of
S control chart by using the sampling distribution of S to find the adjustment
for normal processes with standard deviations change.
5.1. Detection Power of S Control Chart for Normal Processes
Setting up and operating control charts for S requires about the same
sequence of steps as those for 2S control chart, except that for each sample we
must calculate the sample standard deviation S ,

1.70 change in standard deviation when 12n  for S control chart, whereas
standard deviation must change by 1.78 to have this same probability when
10n  .

and 12.
The undetected standard deviation change adjustment is called powerAS
which is the magnitude of change we need to adjust based on designated
detection power and process data come from normal distribution. We develop a
Matlab program to determine the adjustment powerAS by setting the desired
detection power and the sample subgroup size n. For example, if we set detection
power=1/2 and 10(1)30n  . The magnitude of adjustment 1/2AS based on S
control chart is shown from Table 8.
We also provide the powerAS values of S control chart (See Appendix B) for
detection power 1/ 3, 1/ 4 1/ 5and versus various sample subgroup sizes

Change in standard deviation expressed in  units
color-rendering index (CRI). To make sure the optical properties are acceptable
to customers, the wavelengths we choose with highest luminous efficiency at
that time are in blue 455-480 nanometer (nm), green 510-535 nm and red
610-630nm regions.
To illustrate the use of the dynamic pkC to estimate process capability.
Consider Table 9, which presents a part of historical data of wavelength for blue
LED collected from the factory. The proposed specifications on wavelength for
blue LED are USL = 480nm and LSL = 455nm, respectively. From Figure 7, note
that the data lie nearly along a straight line, implying that the distribution of
wavelength is normal distribution. Furthermore, Figure 8 shows the shape of the
histogram implies that the distribution of wavelength is approximately normal
distribution.
