1. Introduction 
 Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have experienced phenomenal progress in the 
last two decades because of their promise of higher efficiencies and lower pollutant 
emissions in comparison to other conventional energy conversion devices like 
internal combustion engines and turbines [1, 2]. 
To obtain high ionic and/or electronic conductivities in the electrolyte or 
electrode oxides, multiple doping is often necessary. In the conventional ceramic 
process route, multiple doping is achieved by mixing various raw oxide powders. 
The ball-milling and repeated grinding and sintering required in this solid state 
reaction route are energy-intensive and time-consuming. In addition, the composition 
homogeneity in the resultant powder is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, a simple, fast 
and cost-effective process method for preparation of doped oxide powders is highly 
desirable.  
Citrate precursor method is a simple sol-gel process capable of circumventing 
above-mentioned difficulties in preparation of doped oxide powders [3-5]. In citrate 
precursor method, citric acid and metal precursors are dissolved in the starting 
solution. The citric acid plays the role of chelating agent to hold various metal ions 
together. This is extremely important, especially in a multi-elements system where 
preferential segregation of particular element(s) can happen easily without chelating 
agent. The starting solution turns to viscous gel and then spongy after heating at a 
relatively low temperature (e. g. 90°C~110°C), oxide powder is finally obtained after 
subsequent calcination at high temperature (e. g. 1000°C) in air. The atomic scale 
mixing of various metal ions in the starting solution results in an excellent 
composition homogeneity of the resultant powder.  
Recently, a modified citrate precursor method was employed to prepare MgO, 
NiO/MgO and Pr-doped CeO2 powders [6, 7]. Because the organic compounds in 
citrate precursors directly calcined in air will burn up violently and emit great heat 
resulting partial sintering in the final powder, a calcination step under nitrogen 
protection atmosphere was added before the final calcination in air in this modified 
method to obtain nanosized particles. However, the advantages of using powders 
thus obtained as raw material were not explored in these studies because subsequent

2. Experimental  
Calculated amounts of Ba(NO3)2 (Showa, 98%), Sr(NO3)2 (Showa, 98%), 
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Showa, 98%), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Showa, 99%) and citric acid were 
dissolved in de-ionized water to prepare the starting solution with mole ratio of 
Ba:Sr:Co:Fe = 5:5:8:2. The total concentration of metal ions in the starting solution 
was 0.5 M. The starting solution was then heated and stirred for 30 minutes to 
promote chelation. The solution was then dried in 110C for 12 h to obtain a 
spongy-like material, i.e., Ba-Sr-Co-Fe citrate precursor. The citrate precursor was 
then cooled, ground and calcined to obtain the oxide powder. Two different 
calcination schemes were adopted: one was performed in air at 900C for 3 h; the 
other was performed at 900C in N2 protection atmosphere for 2 h and then at 400C 
in air for 2 h.   
BSCF films were screen-printed on both sides of CGO disks to prepare 
symmetrical cells for electrochemical measurement. The CGO substrate disks of 15 
mm diameter and 0.5 mm thickness were prepared by solid state sintering at 1400°C 
for 4 h using CGO powder (Rhodia GDC 91-SY). The slurry with proper viscosity 
for screen printing was typically obtained by ball-milling a mixture of 6 g BSCF 
powder obtained above with 6.5g ethyl cellulose-terpineol binder. After screen 
printing, the symmetrical cells were baked at 120°C to eliminate the organic 
components and then sintered. Four different sintering temperatures (800, 850, 900 
and 950°C) were employed to see their effects on the microstructure of the obtained 
electrode films and consequences on their electrochemical performance. 
Phase identification was carried out for the calcined powders and the sintered 
films using an x-ray powder diffractometer (Siemens D5000) with a Cu tube and a 
quartz monochromator on the diffracted beam side. A scanning electron microscope 
(SEM, Joel, JSM-6330) was used for observation of the morphology of the prepared 
powders and films. TEM (Joel AEM 3010) was also used to observe the grain sizes 
of the powders. Impedances of symmetrical cells were measured using a 
potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab PGSTAT30) with an excitation voltage of 50 mV. 
The impedance spectra were recorded over the frequency range of 0.01-100 kHz in 
the temperature of 500-700C under ambient air.

BSCF electrode was obtained from the P-NA powder and the sintering temperature 
of 850C. The ohmic resistances of electrolytes and Pt wires in the high frequency 
end were deleted for clarity. For each measurement temperature, an impedance arc 
intercepts the Z’ axis at two ends, and the difference of these two intercepts gives the 
interfacial area specific resistance (ASR) value for the BSCF electrodes. The ASR 
values of all BSCF electrodes were determined from the corresponding impedance 
spectra and shown in Fig. 9. The ASR value decreases with increasing measurement 
temperature for each of the current electrodes as expected, irrespective of their 
different sintering temperatures For electrodes derived from the P-A powder, the 
ASR value at each measurement temperature decreases with electrode sintering 
temperature from 800 to 900C, and then increases again for the electrode sintered at 
950C (Fig. 9(a)). For electrodes derived from the P-NA powder, smaller ASR values 
with similar variation with sintering temperature are observed (Fig. 9 (b)). 
The variation of ASR values for current BSCF electrodes can be explained by 
the following microstructure consideration. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 
a mixed conductor electrode such as BSCF consists of (1) gas diffusion of O2 
molecules inside the electrode, (2) surface reaction, (3) O-2 ion diffusion in the 
electrode, (4) O-2 ion transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The surface 
reaction is a complex electrochemical process comprising several individual steps: 
O2 molecule adsorption on the electrode surface, subsequent dissociation into two 
oxygen atoms and finally incorporation as O-2 ion into the first layer of the mixed 
conductor electrode or electrolyte through three phase boundary. Therefore, an ideal 
electrode should posses (1) enough pores for O2 molecules to penetrate, (2) large 
surface area to provide as many reaction sites as possible and (3) a continuous solid 
oxide frame for O-2 ions to diffuse. To quantify the film porosity, films obtained in 
this work were scratched off and weighed, and their apparent densities were then 
calculated. The film volumes needed in the calculation were obtained from the 
measured thicknesses (Fig. 7) and the known constant diameter of 10 mm. By 
comparing with the theoretical density of BSCF (5.81 g/cm3) [13], the percentages of 
pore volume were obtained and shown in Table 1. The high porosity in these films 
allows quick diffusion of O2 molecules in the electrodes. On the other hand, the

4. Conclusion 
BSCF films well-adhered on CGO substrates were obtained with relatively low 
sintering temperatures ranging from 800-950C using either P-A or P-NA powder. 
The grain sizes in the P-NA and P-A powders are comparable (10~50 nm), and 
subsequent sintering only resulted in insignificant (for sintering temperatures of 800 
and 850C) or mild grain growth (for sintering temperatures of 900 and 950C). The 
coarser aggregates in P-A powder resulted in less densification in the sintered 
electrode films and hence less BSCF material and larger interfacial ASR values. The 
optimum sintering temperature for current electrode films is 900C, which resulted 
in sufficient necking and secure contact between neighboring particles for O-2 ion 
diffusion and very minor grain growth rendering large surface area for oxygen 
reduction reaction. Among all electrodes examined in this work, the one derived 
from the P-NA powder and the sintering temperature of 900C showed the best 
electrochemical performance: the corresponding ASR values measured were 0.78, 
0.10 and 0.018 cm2 at 500, 600 and 700°C, respectively.
