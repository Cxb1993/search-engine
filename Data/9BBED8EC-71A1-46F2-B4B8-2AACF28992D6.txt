geometry, to consider the computational time, we may use fast solvers when discretizations are 
based on the underlying Cartesian mesh. 
Various methods used to handle the flow in complex domains, one approach is Peskin’s [1] 
immersed boundary (IB) method that is commonly used in structure grids in Cartesian coordinate 
system. The IB method becomes more significantly related to CFD because the generation of grids 
to tackle the flows with complex stationary or moving boundaries is negligible. Various research 
efforts have been made into the improvement of the Peskin’s IB method [2] to retain the formally 
second order spatial accuracy [3], enforcing the volume conservation enclosed by an immersed 
boundary [4], and increasing the resolution across the fluid-solid interface [5]. According to the 
review paper of Mittal and Iaccarino, the IB method used to simulate incompressible viscous flows 
can be classified into two major categories, namely continuous forcing and discrete forcing [6]. In 
the continuous forcing methods, the Navier-Stokes should add a forcing term before the 
discretizations of them. Various studies have employed the concept of continuous forcing, such as 
the original method of Peskin [1], and its subsequent extensions by Goldstein et al. [7]. The key 
issue of the continuous forcing IB method is the boundaries are modeled as pure force-generators, 
in which it can be implemented to discretize Navier-Stokes equations related to a fixed or moving 
obstacles interacting with a fluid. As far as the discrete forcing method is concerned, the forcing 
term can be either explicitly or implicitly applied to the discretization of Navier-Stokes [8-11]. The 
present study is the first of its kind to use finite element formulation to solve viscous flows in 
combination with an embedding method by using an interpolation scheme to handle the immersed 
boundaries. The obvious complication in using Cartesian grid methods is in imposition of boundary 
conditions at the immersed boundary. In particular, since the immersed boundary can cut through 
the underlying Cartesian mesh in an arbitrary manner, the main challenge is to construct a boundary 
treatment which does not adversely impact the accuracy and conservation property of the 
underlying numerical solver. This is especially critical for viscous flows where inadequate 
resolution of boundary layers that form on the immersed boundaries can reduce the fidelity of the 
numerical solution. The inappropriate treatment of the immersed boundaries can reduce the 
accuracy of the numerical solution, which is especially critical for viscous flows where there is 
inadequate resolution. These issues increase the difficulties in the numerical computation while 
dealing with the irregular domains. To comprehend the complexities of the viscous flows including 
the immersed boundary, we adopt a new compact interpolation scheme near the immersed 
boundaries that allows us to retain the formally second order spatial accuracy and conservation 
property of the solver. The interpolation scheme is designed in the spirit of the shape function of the 
finite element method.  
The standard Galerkin finite element is equivalent to a central difference approximation, which

discretization technique for fluid dynamics problems with complex stationary or moving 
boundaries, such as compressible, incompressible, non-isothermal, and porous medium flow. The 
key feature of the CBS scheme is the discretization along the characteristics. In this study, the 
original backward discretization procedure is considered. We describe the backward Euler temporal 
discretization of the equations along the characteristics. The Navier-Stokes equations based on the 
CBS discretizations can be expressed as: 
1 [ ]n n nU U t R P S+ = + Δ −∇ + GG G G                           (3) 
where  2( ) (1/ Re)R U U U= − ⋅∇ + ∇G G G G  and ( / 2) [ ]S t U R P= Δ ⋅∇ −∇GK K

 refers to the stabilization of the velocity solution in the case of highly convective flows. Note, 
pressure stabilization is obtained by an operator splitting procedure, thus the solution of momentum 
equation may be obtained without considering the pressure term in the form of  
1 ˆˆ [ ]n n nU U t R S+ = + Δ +G G                              (4) 
where ˆ ( / 2) [ ]S t U R= Δ ⋅∇ GK  
The velocity vector Uˆ , computed from Eq. (4), does not satisfy the conservation of mass and 
therefore it is not physically relevant. We may apply divergence operator to the time discrete 
momentum Eqs.(2-4), and the divergence operator to the resulting correction equation as 
{ }1 ˆ [ ] ( / 2) [ ]nU U t P t P+∇ ⋅ = + Δ −∇ + Δ ⋅∇ −∇G                        (5) 
We may assume the left-hand side (LHS) of eq. (5) equals zero, to enforce the incompressibility at 
each time step, if the higher order derivative terms is neglected, Eq. (5) can be solved implicitly for 
the pressure and the scheme is obtained 
2 1ˆ0 [ ]nU t P += ∇ ⋅ + Δ −∇                            (6) 
If we obtain Uˆ  and 1+np , the final velocity field at each time step can be derived in the form  
1 1ˆ [ ]n nU U t P+ += − Δ ∇G                             (7) 
Eqs. (4, 6-7) were discretized by the standard Galerkin method using four-point rectangular bilinear 
elements in two dimensions. The resulting finite element equations can be integrated by the 
Galerkin weighting,

Thus, the value of 1φ  can be interpolated using the immersed boundary value bφ  and virtual point 
value vφ . Here, the value of vφ  is fixed in the virtual point. We should project the nodal point 1 
into the immersed boundary and find an extrapolation virtual point, which three points (b, 1, v) are 
the connection with a straight line and are perpendicular to the immersed boundary. A bilinear 
interpolation 2D shape function can be expressed as  
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4v N N N Nφ φ φ φ φ= + + +                           (13) 
In particular, the value of 1φ  can be calculated by the linear approximation at the two points b and 
v: 
2 1
1 b v
L L
L L
φ φ φ= +                                   (14) 
where 1L  is the length between b and 1, 2L  is the length between 1 and v, L  is the length equal 
to 1 2L L+ , as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). 
A compact interpolating function can be obtained by combining the above two Eqs.(13, 14) as

φ φ φ φ φ− − − − =                        (15) 
The above equation can be used as a constraint and alters the underlying matrix operator in the rows 
corresponding to the boundary cell. We may substitute Eq. (15) into the underlying matrix operator 
by using an implicit or explicit scheme. If an implicit scheme is used, the unknown variables are 
1 2 3 4, , ,φ φ φ φ . However, we should use an iterative scheme to obtain a convergence state during each 
computational stage. 
An accurate representation of irregular domains can be accomplished using refined meshes. For 
example, a non-rectangular region cannot be represented using rectangular elements. However, it 
can be represented by quadrilateral elements. In general, it is necessary to transform the finite 
element integral statements defined over quadrilaterals to a rectangle. However, one of the 
advantages of the present methodology is a complex physical domain can be accomplished using a 
rectangular element without the Gauss-Legendre numerical integration scheme. Because we make 
use of a special treatment in the cut cells for the discretization, the NS equation ensures the 
accuracy of the solution in the cut cells. 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
First, we simulate our code by comparing results to those obtained in other benchmark studies. 
Uniform flow past a cylinder is selected to verify the proposed model by comparing others in the 
literature. We select cases of Reynolds numbers equal to 20, 40, 100, 120, 160, and 200 for the 
problem.

scheme on a non-uniform grids generated by a simple node generator. From the viewpoint of the 
traditional method to produce unstructured meshes or generate body-fitting meshes by coordinate 
transformation, our proposed method has a simple way to handle the mesh generation. In the present 
study, the two staggered cylinders were arranged with a streamwise gap of L and transverse gap of S. 
For the tandem or staggered arrangement, the distance between the centers of two identical cylinders 
with L was varied from 2D, 3D, 4D up to 5D, and S was varied from 0D, 0.2D, 0.6D, 1D, 1.5D up 
to 2D. The implementation of the initial and boundary conditions are the same as those in the case 
for the flow around a circular cylinder. The definition of the Reynolds number is also based on the 
diameter of the cylinder. A pair of cylinders of diameter D=1 was placed inside the flow domain 
with the center of the first cylinder located at 7x D=  and 0y = , and the location of the second 
cylinder depending on various L and S. We simulated a series of cases for various streamwise gaps 
(L) and transverse gaps (S). First, the non-uniform grids with 301 151×  nodal points were chosen 
for Re=20, 40, 60, 80 up to 100. The characteristics of the forces acting on two cylinders can be well 
understood by plotting the drag and the lift coefficients, as shown in Table 3, for various values of 
Reynolds number and streamwise gap, L and S=0. As the L increases, the drag coefficient is a 
function of the Reynolds number. The highest values of the drag coefficient appear in Re=20 and 
L=4D. For D2C , the minimum value appears in the case of L=2. The drag coefficient for the 
cylinder 2 decreases with larger center-to-center distance converging to a value that corresponds to a 
single cylinder. This is because the mean repulsive force between the cylinders weakens for larger 
gaps. With increases in the Reynolds number, the D1C  decreases for the L=2D, 3D, 4D up to 5D 
and various Reynolds number except when L=5D and Re=100. The clear trend of the D1C  is higher 
than the D2C  compared with the various Re and L. Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) illustrate the time-based 
variation of the drag coefficients ( D1C  and D2C ) as a function of flow around a pair cylinders for 
various L=2D, 3D, 4D and 5D and S=0 at Re=100. As the L increases to 5D, the effect of both D1C  
and D2C  oscillate in periodic motion with time. The maximum value of D1C  appears in the case 
of L=4D. However, D2C  is smaller than the value of D1C . At L=5D, both values of D1C  and D2C  
are larger compared with other cases of various streamwise gaps. The drag coefficient on cylinder 1 
is approximately 1.15, while the drag coefficient for the cylinder 2 is slightly negative, being in the 
shadow of the first. An initial look at the range of drag coefficients ( L1C and L2C ) values shown on 
Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) clearly indicates both L1C and L2C  increase with increases in the value of the 
streamwise gap between two cylinders. The pattern of L1C and L2C  maintain a SINE function with 
time series for the case of L=5D. The value of the L1C and L2C  on the first and second cylinders

past two staggered cylinders demonstrate the present numerical algorithm has correctly predicted 
the vortex motion process between a pair of staggered cylinders for different values of transverse 
gap. The proposed algorithm could enforce the immersed boundary values. This fact is verified by 
the expected results predicted by the present algorithm for the flow and vorticity fields. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, 2D viscous flow problems are undertaken by the CBS-FEM with complex immersed 
boundaries on Cartesian grids, which is a robust and effective scheme for application in the 
Navier-Stokes equations solver. The principle is applied through involving the operator splitting 
technique, balance tensor diffusivity (BTD), Runge-Kutta time-stepping method, and a bi-conjugate 
gradient iterative solver. In particular, since the immersed boundary can cut through the underlying 
Cartesian mesh in an arbitrary manner, the main challenge is to construct a boundary treatment 
which does not adversely impact the accuracy and conservation property of the underlying 
numerical solver. To comprehend the complexities of the viscous flows including the immersed 
boundary, we adopt a new compact interpolation scheme near the immersed boundaries that allows 
us to retain second-order accuracy of the solver. The interpolation scheme is designed in the spirit 
of the shape function of a finite element. The numerical procedure developed in the present work is 
validated by comparing the results obtained with the problem of flow past a circular cylinder and a 
pair of two cylinders. The excellent agreement of the validation problems and the reasonable 
performances of the other cases demonstrate the present scheme can be exploited for a viscous flow 
problem not only with flow past over a circular cylinder but also with flow past several complex 
bodies. Therefore, it is concluded that the present study provides a basis for the CBS-FEM 
formulation by using an interpolation scheme of solving 2D fluid flow with complex immersed 
boundaries.
