Abstract 
In this project, some similarity measures for 
fractal image compression (FIC) are introduced, 
which are robust against noises.  In the proposed 
methods, robust regression technique from statistics 
is embedded into the encoding procedure of the 
fractal image compression.  When the original 
image is corrupted by noises, we hope that the 
fractal image compression scheme is insensitive to 
those noises presented in the corrupted image.  
This leads to a new concept of robust fractal image 
compression.  The proposed least absolute 
derivation (LAD), least trimmed squares (LTS), and 
Wilcoxon FIC are the first attempt toward the design 
of robust fractal image compression which can 
remove the noises in the encoding process.  The 
main disadvantage of the robust FIC is the 
computational cost.  To overcome this drawback, 
particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is 
utilized to reduce the searching time.  Simulation 
results show that the proposed FIC is robust against 
the outliers in the image.  Also, the PSO method 
can effectively reduce the encoding time while 
retaining the quality of the retrieved image. 
Keywords: Fractal image compression, Least 
absolute derivation, Least trimmed squares, 
Wilcoxon norm, Robust image compression, Particle 
swarm optimization. 
一、前言 
Fractal image compression (FIC) was originally 
proposed by Barnsley [1,6,19] and first realized by 
Jacquin in 1992 [12].  The underlying premise of 
fractal image compression is based on the 
partitioned iterated function system (PIFS) which 
utilizes the self-similarity property in the image to 
achieve the purpose of compression.  As FIC has 
promise of high compression ratio at good 
decompression quality, many applications for the 
multimedia purposes, such as video compression 
[24,26], have been attracted. 
In practical application, the images at hand are 
often corrupted by noises.  It is then desirable for 
the fractal image compression scheme to be 
insensitive to those outliers caused by the noises.  
This motivates us to consider the design of robust 
fractal image compression against those outliers. 
The commonly used robust regression techniques 
include M estimation [8], least trimmed squares 
(LTS) estimation [20], S estimation [21], and MM 
estimation [29].  There is a family of robust 
regression analysis that replaces the sum of squared 
errors to be minimized with one less influenced by 
outliers [18].  Among all the approaches to robust 
regression, the least absolute derivation (LAD), or 
1l -norm, is considered conceptually the simplest one 
since it does not require a “tuning” mechanism 
required in other robust regression techniques [16].  
The LTS estimator is a classical high- breakdown 
robust estimator which gets rid of the portion of 
residuals of high values.  The Wilcoxon method 
uses the Wilcoxon norm of the residuals, which 
considers the ranks and the related scores of the 
residuals instead of the magnitudes.  In this paper, 
we focus on the robust regressions LAD, LTS, and 
Wilcoxon estimates. 
In the traditional FIC, the encoder computes the 
contrast scaling and the brightness offset by a 
formula derived from the calculus optimization 
methods directly.  We will state that the 
determination of these two parameters can also be 
obtained from the statistical regression method on 
the residuals.  The results are exactly the same if 
the least-squares method, i.e., 2l -norm, is adopted.  
As is well known in regression theory that the linear 
regressor based on least-squares principle is 
sensitive to outliers.  That is, the residual sum of 
squares is not a good robustness indicator.  On the 
other hand, the linear regressor based on minimizing 
the sum of absolute derivation (AD), trimmed 
squares (TS), and Wilcoxon norm of the residuals [7] 
are quite robust against outliers.  This motivates us 
to consider the FIC using LAD approach (LAD-FIC), 
LTS approach (LTS-FIC), and Wilcoxon estimate 
(WFIC).  This is the first attempt toward the design 
of robust fractal image compression.  To get some 
flavor of the robustness against outliers for the LAD, 
LTS and Wilcoxon regressor, consider the following 
linear regression problem. 
To encode an image according to the 
self-similarity property, each block to be encoded 
must search in a large pool to find the best match.  
For the traditional full search method, the encoding 
process is time-consuming because a large amount

四、研究方法 
The fundamental idea of fractal image 
compression is the partitioned iteration function 
system with the underlying theory founded by the 
Contractive Mapping Fixed-Point Theorem and the 
Collage Theorem [11].  For a given gray level 
image of size NN × , let the range pool R be the set 
of the ( )2LN  non-overlapping blocks of size 
LL ×  which is the size of encoding unit.  Let the 
contractivity of the fractal coding be a fixed number 
2.  Thus, the domain pool is composed of the set of 
( )212 +− LN  overlapping blocks each of which has 
size ( ) ( )LL 22 × .  For the case of 256×256 image 
with 8×8 coding size, the range pool contains 1024 
blocks of size 88×  and the domain pool contains 
58081 blocks of size 16×16.  For each range block 
v in the range pool R, one searches in the domain 
pool for the best match, i.e., the most similar domain 
block.   
At each search entry, the domain block is first 
down-sampled to LL×  and denoted by u .  Let 
the set of down-sampled domain blocks be denoted 
by D.  The down-sampled block is transformed 
subject to the eight transformations in the Dihedral 
group on the pixel positions.  If the origin of u  is 
assumed to be located at the center of the block, the 
eight transformations 7,,0: K=kTk  can be 
represented by the following matrices:

of the 2l -norm.

The LAD approach chooses w  and b  that

where the residuals is defined in (5). This is a 
standard LAD problem, which can be solved by 
numerical methods, for instance, Barrodale-Roberts 
(BR) algorithm [2,3], Bartels-Conn-Sinclair 
algorithm [4], and Bloomfield-Steiger algorithm [5].  
In this study, we adopt the maximum likelihood (ML) 
algorithm in [16]. 
The related numerically strategies about the ML 
are stated in detailed as follows:  
Step 1: Calculated the solutions w  and b  from 
LS regression. Set these solutions as the 
initial values. 
Step 2: Find the index j  using weighted median of 
( )( )liiii xbyxMEDj 1| =−= o  and 
set ( ) jj xbyw −= . 
Step 3: Set 1+← kk  and compute jii xxz −= , for 
all li ∈ . 
Step 4: Update jwxbb +← . 
Step 5: Find the index m  using weighted median of 
( )( )liiii zbyzMEDm 1| =−= o . 
Step 6: Set ( ) mm zbyw −= , 
update jwxbb −←  and set mj = . 
Step 7: If the stopping criterion meets, then stop, 
otherwise go to Step 3. 
 
In this project, we set a pre-specified maximum 
number of iterations to stop the iteration.  Also, if 
the absolute variation of w  is less than ε , it stops.  
In the algorithm, the index of weighted median of 
)|( 1liiixMED =Ω= oγ  is performed by the following 
steps: 
1. Calculate the threshold ( )∑

trimming constant h  is chosen so that lhl <≤2/ .  
We apply recursive weighted least squares (RWLS)

3. FIC Using Wilcoxon Regressor 
Wilcoxon norm is a semi-norm defined through a 
ranking process and a score function [7].  A score 
function is a non-decreasing function 
( ) [ ] ℜ→1,0:xϕ  such that 
( ) ∞<∫

Step 5. For each particle, update the velocity and the 
position according to (7) and (8).  Go to 
step 2. 
 
As discussed in Section 2, the parameters xt , yt , 
ud , p, and q constitute the fractal code.  In the 
proposed method, we encode a given particle as ( )yx tt , , which is the position of the domain block.  
For each ( )yx tt , , all of the eight Dihedral 
transformations in (1) are performed and the best 
Dihedral index ud  together with the corresponding 
contrast scaling p, brightness offset q, and Wilcoxon 
norm of residuals, which is treated as the cost of the 
given particle, can be obtained.  When the stopping 
criterion is met, the final ( )## , yx tt  together with the 
corresponding #ud , 
#p , and #q  is the fractal code 
of the given range block v.  The steps of encoding a 
range block using PSO are summarized as follows: 
Step 1. Initialize the parameters of PSO. 
Step 2. For each particle ( )yx tt , , fetch the domain 
block at ( )yx tt ,  in the image.  Sub-sample 
the block and denote it by u . 
Step 3.For each Dihedral transformation, obtain ku , 
7,,0 K=k .  Calculate the contrast scaling 
kp  by minimizing the Wilcoxon norm of 
residuals and brightness offset kq  by taking 
the median of the final residuals.  The 
corresponding Wilcoxon norm of residuals, 
which is treated as the cost of the given 
particle, is obtained during the process. 
Step 4. Update the PBEST and the GBEST if 
required.  The corresponding fractal codes 
are also updated accordingly. 
Step 5. If stopping criterion is met, then stop. 
Step 6. For each particle, update the velocity and the 
position according (7) and (8).  Go to step 
2. 
 
五、結果與討論 
In this section, the proposed LAD-FIC, LTS-FIC, 
and WFIC and the corresponding PSO methods are 
simulated and verified.  In the simulation, the 
images Lena, Pepper, F16, and Baboon of size 
256256×  are used with 88×  coding size.  For 
consistency, we use the same initial image for 
decoding, which is the Baboon image.  The number 
of decoding iterations is set to 10, which is sufficient 
to yield stable retrieved images.  Simulation 
programs are implemented using Borland C++ 
Builder 6.0 running on Microsoft Windows XP, Intel 
Core 2 Duo E8400 3-GHz CPU, and 4-GB RAM 
platform. 
The distortion between two images ( )jif ,  and 
( )jif ,ˆ , both of size NN × , is measured in PSNR

Note that the PSNR is actually not a good 
measure for LAD-FIC, LTS-FIC, and WFIC 
methods, because these methods do not use the 
standard 2l -norm of residuals as the similarity 
measure.  Nevertheless, we will still use PSNR for 
comparison. 
The main issue of this paper is the robustness 
against outliers.  However we still require that the 
proposed method also performs well on the occasion 
when no noise or outliers present.  Fig. 1 shows the 
simulation results.  The Fig. 1(a) is the original 
Lena image and 1(b) is uncorrupted image to be 
encoded. Fig. 1(c) is the decoded image from 
traditional full search method, which yields quality 
(PSNR) of 28.91 dB.  In the second row, 1(d), 1(e), 
and 1(f) show the retrieved images from LAD-FIC, 
LTS-FIC, and WFIC methods, respectively, with 
their corresponding quality of 28.53dB, 28.91 dB, 
and 28.75 dB.  As can be seen, the qualities are 
almost the same as that of the traditional full search 
method.  The drawback of the proposed methods is 
the encoding time as shown.  The results of 
proposed PSO method for the three robust FIC are 
illustrated in 1(g), 1(h), and 1(i).  For LAD-FIC 
method, the encoding time in 1(d) is 21,333 seconds, 
while for the PSO-based method, it is 418 seconds 
as shown in 1(g), which is even faster that the 
traditional method of 1,864 seconds as shown in 1(c).  
As to the image quality, there is only about 1dB 
decay.  Similar results are shown in Fig. 1(e) and 
1(h) for LTS-FIC and Fig. 1(f) and 1(i) for WFIC. 
While images corrupted by salt and pepper noise 
for which a corrupted pixel has the intensity value 0 
or 255, the proposed robust methods outperform 
traditional FIC.  Fig. 2 demonstrates the robustness 
of the three proposed methods.  In this experiment, 
we randomly corrupt the Lena image with 10% 
noise, about 6,554 pixels, as shown in Fig. 2(b).  
Since the image is highly corrupted, the retrieved 
image for FIC has PSNR 12.57 dB only as shown in 
Fig. 2(c), in which the retrieved image can hardly be
