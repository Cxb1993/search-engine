Remediation of PAH Contaminated Soil using Micro-Emulsified Solvent and Mixed 
Surfactant 
Introduction 
The problem of environmental pollution always accompanies with the development of 
industry. Taiwan has put into practice the law about the remediation of soil and groundwater in 
2000. However, there are more than 700 contaminant sites restrained now. Some of the organic 
contaminants existed on those sites are polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAH) which are not easy 
to be biodegraded and might cause mutation and are considered as carcinogens. It is imperative to 
remediate those contaminants existed in the sites before causing serious problems. 
Soil flushing is a physical method frequently used to remediate contaminated soil, and the 
desorption efficiency (DE) is a crucial factor need to be considered, especially for hydrophobic 
compounds. The molecular structure of surfactants contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends, 
they can enhance the solubilities of hydrophobic compounds. A lot of researchers have put effort on 
the desorption of hydrophobic compounds from soils. However, the cost and the environmental 
friendliness of the remediation methods determine the use. Several studies tried to use vegetable oil 
as the flushing solution to bring out the hydrophobic compounds from soils, but the viscosity and 
the possibility of clogging are problems need to be solved first. 
In this research, the merits of surfactant and oil are combined together to make 
micro-emulsified solvent (MES), which has hydrophilic end of surfactant outside and hydrophobic 
end of oil drop inside. The surfactant end favors its solubility in water, and the oil drop enhanced 
the partitioning of hydrophobic compounds. Since it was made in the size range of nanometer, the 
transpass in saturated soil is much easier. The optimization of surfactant SDS to soybean oil ratio 
and conditions were studied in this research. The stability and DE of PAH in contaminated soils by 
MES were also thoroughly discussed as well as the regeneration of used MES by activated carbon. 
Materials and Methods 
There are four stages in this study. First, the soil gathered was wind-dried, then sieved, and 
analyzed for it characteristics, such as the particle size, BET surface area and total organic carbon. 
Second, the optimized condition was investigated to get the best MES. Third, applying MES to 
PAH contaminated soil to study the efficiencies under different conditions. Forth, understand the 
possibility of regeneration of EMS by activated carbon. It has been known that the used surfactant 
could be regenerated by activated carbon.  
The soil collected was wind-dried for 7 days and sieved with USA standard #140 and #200 
mesh. The size of soil prepared for the experiments is between 0.105 mm ~ 0.074 mm. All other 
parameters were listed in Table 3. From the analysis of particle size, the texture of soil used was 
sandy soil.

surfactant used in this study is hydrophilic; it was dissolved in water before mixing with oil to 
prepare the micro-emulsified solvent.

The oil used to make micelle is vegetable oil, it can increase not only the solubility of PAH, 
but also the environmental impact. Vegetable oil is less harm to environment than ether, alkane, and 
alcohol. In order to get the idea about how much oil can dissolved in the prepared SDS solution, the 
amount of 1、5、10、15 ml oil was added to the SDS solution, it was found that the soybean oil 
starting to float on the solution surface at 15 ml (Fig. 1). Therefore, the amount of 10 ml oil added 
in the surfactant solution was used in the subsequent experiments.  
The formed micelle size was measured using laser differential particle size analyzer. The 
smaller the micelle size, the smaller the chance of collision happens among micelles. In other 
words, the stability increases with the decreases of the diameter of MES, and the micelles will not 
aggregate with each other [1]. 
The stability is the most important factor in the study of MES. With different fraction of oil, 
the MES was settled for one day to check the formation of stratification. Test tubes from A to E 
with different fraction of oil show no observed stratification (Fig. 2). The stability and efficiency of 
MES made by the sonicator with probe is greater than that made by a mixer. In the tube F, the MES 
was prepared using ultrasonic cleaner, which show a clear stratification between water and oil after 
one day.

Fig. 7 Effect of different concentrations of 
anthracene on the desorption efficiencies 
There is no significant change in the micelle size in the sonication time from 40 to 60 min 
(Table 3). In the consideration of benefit-cost, the time of 40 min was adopted in following 
experiments. The final conditions to emulsify micelles are at 75℃, 40 min, and the ratio of SDS 
solution to oil is 90:10 (v/v).  
Soil spiked with anthracene was used to investigate the desorption related parameters in the 
flushing. The desorption efficiencies (DEs) using SDS and EMS were compared. After 12, 24, 36 
and 48 h of reaction, the DEs of SDS were about 20% in the soil with 500 ppm anthracene, 
indicating that the desorption time has less influence on DE (Fig. 5). However, the DEs of EMS 
increased from 50% to 91% after 12 and 48 h, respectively. There was good correlation between 
desorption time and efficiency. The dominant mechanism of between EMS and anthracene in soil 
was diffusion, it took longer to reach equilibration. The mechanism between sorbed anthracene and 
SDS was more likely ion-exchange, it reached equilibrium in a short time. 
The DE for EMS is about 3.5 times higher than that of SDS, the EMS provided a good 
hydrophobic phase for anthracene to partition, but it took longer time to reach equilibrium. Anion 
surfactant SDS was mixed non-ionic surfactant TX-100 to test the DE of sorbed phenanthrene in 
soil with a concentration of 100 mg/kg. The result showed that TX-100 has a DE less than 5% in 
100 ppm anthracene containing soil, the mixed surfactant of SDS with TX-100 in ratio 7:3 and 3:7 
reached desorption efficiencies 78% and 52%, respectively (Fig. 6). Also, they are less than the 
desorption efficiency of EMS. The hydrophobicity of oil has higher affinity for PAHs [3]. 
To understand the DE of EMS in remediation of low concentration contaminated site, the 
following experiment was conducted. Desorption efficiencies of anthracene in different 
concentrations of 100 ppm、200 ppm、500 ppm were 50%, 68%, and 91%, respectively (Fig. 7). The
