英文摘要 
In this project, several computational intelligent approaches are developed for constructing the gene-pathway 
to realize the interactions between genes. In other words, we shall achieve modeling and analysis of a gene network. 
First, the pathway is generated on the basis of nonlinear differential equations, which include mathematical 
descriptions of activatory terms and inhibitory terms. On the other hand, the gene regulatory networks are 
constructed by Bayesian Network technique. We have finish the pathways for two biology dataset (varian-cancer 
genes and Sacharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle genes),  
Keywords: Bayesian Network, Gene Regulatory Network 
（一）目的與文獻 
In this project, the gene-relationship pathways are proposed, respectively, by HDE/IGA-technology-based nonlinear 
differential equations and a Bayesian network. 
The gene-relationship pathway for ovarian cancer can’t be constructed by 
nonlinear-differential-equations-based approaches since we have only 3 time-courses data. In other words, the gene 
network for our ovarian-cancer dataset can’t be obtained via identification of S-system [1] and lumped power-law 
system, modified by [2]. The research in cell cycle is important and the related dataset is available in the website. 
Therefore, we use yeast dataset to realize cell reproduction and further to predict cancer’s development. In our work, 
HDE and IGA techniques are used to construct, respectively, S-system and lumped power-low system for 
Sacharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle genes dataset, which is operated in cdc25 experiment. As we know, these two 
mathematical models are highly nonlinear. Therefore, the identification for both structure and parameters is tough 
work even for a system with low numbers of genes. However, the generated two systems are useful in realizing 
gene-genes relationship. 
A genetic algorithm is an optimal searching method proposed by Holland in 1975 [3-9]. It is different from 
other optimal methods. No complexity calculation is needed in a genetic algorithm. However, the performance, at 
first, is not so good. Recently, researchers proposed various methods to increase the performance [10-14]. Chiang 
proposed a genetic algorithm with an improved-evolution-direction operator (IEDO) [15]. The IEDO is further 
evolved by evolution direction operator (Yamamoto [14]). More and more researches focused on the so-called 
improved genetic algorithm (IGA), where an IEDO, an elitism [5, 6], an acceleration operator [16-18] and a 
migration [19-21] are integrated into a genetic algorithm. 
Evolution algorithms have been applied widely in parameter estimation. Storn and Price proposed a differential 
evolution (DE) method [22, 23]. In this method, population-differences are calculated during an evolution process, 
but the solution space frequently bog down into local minima. Chiou and Wang proposed a hybrid differential 
evolution (HDE) method to overcome this drawback [24]. A HDE can find the global optimal solution for a highly 
nonlinear differential system and can escape from bogging down into local optimal solution. Voit adopted this 
method, and further added the deviation for the slope of the estimated system from a true system to accelerate the 
searching speed and to adjust the parameters of estimated system [25-27]. Tominaga adopted a genetic algorithm 
with a structure skeletalizing algorithm to achieve the parameter estimation for a power-law differential equations 
[28, 29]. Kikuchi modified the crossover process and added the pruning terms into a fitness function [30]. In our 
project, we adopt both HDE and IGA algorithms to identify both S-system and lumped power-low system and to 
construct the corresponding gene network. 
In other hand, we use a Bayesian Network to construct a gene network directly from the gene time-courses data. 
Bayesian Network is a graphical model, based on the joint probability distribution of random variables. Many 
research methods are based on this technology [31-36]. We here use this graphical technique to generate the gene 
networks for both ovarian-cancer and Sacharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle genes dataset.

Five sets of time-course data are generated from different initial values.  Variable X1 denotes CDC28, X2 for 
CLN3, X3 for SWI4, X4 for SWI6, X5 for MBP1, X6 for FUS3, X7 for FAR1, X8 for CLN1, X9 for CLN2, X10 for SIC1, 
X11 for CLB5, X12 for CLB6, X13 for CDC6, X14 for CDC20, X15 for GRR1 and X 6 for CDC4. After training, we 
obtain the S-system structure. Based on this structure, we can create the gene regulatory network in Fig. 1. Black 
bold lines, growing themselves, represent synthetic influence; black bold lines, growing outside, represent degraded 
influence. Black lines represent activation reaction and red lines represent inhibition reaction. The start point of the 
lines is the reactant and the end point is the product. Biochemical reactions can be described by the reconstructed 
model. We now can realize the interaction between various genes from the gene regulatory network. The increasing 
in concentrations of CLN3, MBP1, FUS3, CLB5, CLB6 and CDC20 will bring increasing synthetic influence in 
concentration of CLN3. However, the increasing in concentrations of SIW6, FAR1, CLN1 and CLN2 will bring 
decreasing synthetic influence in concentration of CLN3.

Fig. 2 is the pathway for the modified power-low model. Black lines represent activation reaction and red lines 
represent inhibition reaction. The start point of the lines is the reactant and the end point is the product. For instance, 
the concentration of CDC28 increases rapidly as the concentrations of MBP1, CLN1,  CDC6, CDC20 and GRR1 
increase; however, the concentration of CDC28 decreases rapidly as the concentrations of CLN3, SWI4, FUS3, 
FAR1, CDC4, CLB6 andCLB6 increase.

Then, the network score can be obtained simply. The final step is optimization of network. A strategy for searching 
for DAGs with high score is needed. We adopt the search strategy greedy search with random restarts. In greedy 
search, we create model *D  from model D  that differ only by a single arrow, either added, removed or reversed 
and then calculate the network score. We compare two different models by posterior odds,
