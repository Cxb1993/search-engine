2nism of landslides caused by field wetting
stress path and water infiltration in unsat-
urated lateritic soil slope. A series of lab-
oratory triaxial tests to study the mechan-
ical behavior of lateritic soil has been con-
ducted. The effect of water infiltration on
the strength of lateritic soil that led to slope
instability was also examined.
2 Methodology
To comprehensively study and evaluate the
effects of field stress path and water in-
filtration on the shear strength of unsat-
urated lateritic soil, a series of unsaturated
triaxial testing has been conducted. Two
modified triaxial apparatus were used for
this study. In addition, the basic physical
properties, soil water characteristic curve
(SWCC), in situ suction of the study soil
were also conducted. For all the above se-
ries of tests, intact soil samples were re-
trieved from a study site on Linkou Ter-
race and laboratory tests performed in the
unsaturated soil mechanics laboratory of
NTUT. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD)
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
have been performed to determine the min-
eralogy, chemical compositions and fabric
of the soil, respectively.
2.1 Soil Water characteristic
Curve (SWCC)
The SWCC describes the relationship be-
tween suction and volumetric water con-
tent, gravimetric water content, or degree
of water saturation. SWCC composed of
three pressure ranges: low suction ranges
between 0 kPa to 100 kPa; medium suc-
tion ranges between 100 kPa to 1500 kPa;
high suction ranges more than 1500 kPa.
The testing methods were pressure plate
extractor test (low and medium suction
ranges) and salt solution method (high suc-
tion range). The pressure plate extrac-
tor tests was conducted in accordance with
ASTM D6836-02 (2002) and the salt solu-
tion test was conducted in accordance with
ASTM D5298-94 (2002).
Fredlund and Xing (1994) suggested that
if the condition was under high suction or
suction more than 1500 kPa, the matric
suction equalled the total suction. Eq 1
was used to obtain the matric suction:
h =
RT
ν
· lnRh (1)
where h is suction, R is the ideal gas con-
stant (8.31432 Joules/mole.K), T is the
absolute temperature, ν is the volume of
1000 mole water (0.018 m3), and Rh is the
relative humidity. Gravimetric water con-
tent ω could be related to volumetric water
content θw using Eq 2:
θw =
ωG
1 + e
(2)
2.2 In situ suction
To obtain the in situ suction, filter pa-
per test was conducted in accordance with
ASTM D5298-94 (2002) using Whatman
No.42 filter paper that has a disk size with a
diameter of 55 mm. Other references were:
Fawcett & Collis-George (1967), Houston
et al. (1994), Jiang et al. (2000), and
Leong et al. (2002). ASTM D5298-94
(2002) provides a calibration curve to cor-
relate the water content of the filter pa-
per with total suction for Whatman No.42.
The total suction was calculated using the
following equations (He, 1999):
For wf ≥ 26%:
logψ = 8.778− 0.222wf (3)
For wf < 26%:
logψ = 5.310− 0.301wf (4)
where wf is the water content of the filter
paper.
2.3 Triaxial test
The main method to be used for this study
was via a series of laboratory triaxial test.

tion tests suggested by Melinda et al. (2004).
wetting process that causes the pore-water
pressure to become less negative. Soil get-
ting dryer (Path AB) represents the condi-
tion of a soil slope after a dry period where
the soil above the groundwater table ex-
periences a drying process that results the
pore-water pressure to become more nega-
tive.
The soil specimen was first consolidated
under a net normal stress (path O′A′) and
in the same time the matric suction in
the soil was reduced and equilibrated to
a lower value (path A′B′). The matric
suctions selected were less than the matric
suction at the field condition so that the
soil specimens were on the wetting curve of
the SWCC (Fig 3). Shearing of the spec-
imen was carried out after pressure equal-
ization and under a constant strain rate of
2×10−5 mm/s. Shearing begins at point B
and failed at point D on the yielding enve-
lope (Fig 2). The air and water pressures
were maintained at a constant value (i.e.
drained test). After shearing, soil masses
at various heights of the specimen were ex-
truded for the determination of water con-
tent profile. Water content along the speci-
men height indicates the distribution of the
matric suction through out the soil speci-
men.
Figure 3: Paths for specimen getting wetter.
2.3.2 Shearing-infiltration test
There were two stages in shearing-
infiltration test, i.e. the shearing to a
stress level (path BC in Fig 2) and infil-
tration whereby the matric suction was be-
ing reduced by increasing the water content
(path CE in Fig 2). In short, the shearing
stage was similar to the constant suction
shearing test except that the soil was not
sheared to failure, but sheared to a stress
level and subsequently infiltrated with wa-
ter. During the shearing-infiltration test,
pore-air pressure were under a drained con-
dition and the pore-water pressure were un-
der an undrained condition. Soil specimen
failed at point E under the water infiltra-
tion condition. The water injected into the
specimen was controlled at a constant rate
while the constant shear stress was main-
tained. Tests were terminated when fail-
ure of the specimen was observed. Failure
was considered to have occurred during the
shearing-infiltration test when the deviator
stress started to decreased or the strain rate
started to increased excessively (Anderson
and Sitar, 1995; Ham, 1977; Melinda, 1998;
Wong et al, 2001).
The shear stress level (Point C in Fig 2)
to be maintained on the specimen while the
soil was being infiltrated with water was
first defined, and an appropriate stress level
was the one that ensures that the soil will
fail in an unsaturated condition during the

3.4 Triaxial Test
Fig 7(a) shows the typical shear strength
profiles of the study soil during the con-
stant suction test and shearing-infiltration
test. It was clear that the shear strength
of the study soil dropped significantly in
the shearing-infiltration test and achieved
a critical strength value at the end of fail-
ure. Fig 7(b) shows the variation of the ma-
tric suction in the soil during the shearing-
infiltration test. It could be seen that
large excess pore-water pressure generated
quickly at some points of the infiltration
process causing the matric suction to van-
ished and replaced by the excess pore-water
pressure instead. Fig 7(d) shows the q vs
p′ plot of the tests conducted under ma-
tric suction value of about 40 ∼ 50 kPa.
The stress path shows that all the speci-
men were initially undergoing drained test,
after the commencement of the infiltration
process, the stress path move horizontally
towards the failure envelope. Failure oc-
curred when the stress path touched the
failure envelope. This shows that infiltra-
tion alone could cause failure in the soil
without additional shearing.
Unlike saturated soils where its failure
behavior was understood far better than
that of unsaturated soils, unsaturated soils
was associated with the problem of neg-
ative pore-water pressure changes from a
more to a less negative value during the wa-
ter infiltration. This was because rainfall-
induced landslides can happen in two dis-
tinct conditions of pore-water pressure:
(i) positive pore-water pressure and (ii)
negative pore-water pressure (Han, 2001).
Slope failure at positive pore-water pres-
sures was well known to happen under a
decreasing effective stress. In slopes with
a deep groundwater table, the soils were
unsaturated and the matric suction can be
reduced by the rising groundwater table or
by the movement of a wetting front from
the slope’s surface during a rainfall. Con-
sequently, the average shear strength along
a potential failure surface was reduced to
a value close to that of the average shear
