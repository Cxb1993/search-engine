人體體型和胸罩合身度的關聯性 
摘要 
當個人對於自我身體體型、尺寸大小有不正確的評量，會造成飲食失調或其他心理性的疾病，
所以很多研究使用各種不同工具，讓個人對自我體型進行評估，最常見的工具是使用排成一
列的體型輪廓圖。然而，這些體型輪廓線條在比例上未能完全真實反應女性們具有的複雜體
態，由於人體體型複雜、個體差異大，服裝合身度的問題應運而生。尤其是不同於標準體型，
具有特殊體型的婦女，當他們穿著緊貼人體的服裝種類，例如胸罩時，常會有身體上的疼痛。
這個研究的目的是運用一種體型輪廓圖，來調查受訪者對自己體型的判讀，進而了解受訪者
對自己體型的認知是否不同於專家學者對其體型的判讀。最後再檢驗專家學者對受訪者觀察
而得的體型資料與受訪者穿著胸罩的合身度之間的關連性。研究結果顯示，專家學者認為受
訪者的肩型比起受訪者的自我認知體型更加的平肩，而且專家學者認為受訪者的胸部要平坦
些。其次是具有圓背和垂肩特殊體型的受訪者，對其胸罩罩杯尺寸及車縫線的舒適度有極高
的肯定。相對的，有著標準背型和垂肩特殊體型的受訪者，對其胸罩罩杯合身狀況最不滿意；
有著突出胸部及肩點前移體型的受訪者，對於胸罩的支撐度最不滿意，認為他們胸罩支撐胸
部的能力最差；胸部大而且具有寬肩或窄肩體型的受訪者，皆不滿意其罩杯的尺寸。因此胸
罩製造商應該要針對胸部大而且肩點前傾體型的女性，改善罩杯鋼圈的設計，提供具有良好
支撐性的胸罩。除了需要良好支撐性的胸罩，可針對人體的胸部尺寸大小，更進一步研究，
以發展出適合台灣女性尺寸的罩杯。

Introduction   
An individual’s perceptions of his or her physical appearance in terms of the whole body as 
well as body parts can be overestimated or underestimated. Research is interested in investigating 
the accuracy of body-size estimations, because inaccurate estimation of the body sizes lead to the 
occurrence of eating disorders among patients (Ben-Tovim, Walker, Murray, & Chin, 1990; 
Bergstrom, Stenlund, & Svedijehall, 2000). Various techniques have been employed to measure 
perceptions in evaluating body sizes and body builds, including figural drawings with silhouetted 
body scales, questionnaires, distorting images created by photographs or computers, distorting 
mirrors, video types, and body projections using lights (Bergstrom et al., 2000; Gardner & Brown, 
2010). The most commonly adopted techniques are figural drawing scales recognized as silhouette 
or contour line drawings that consist of a series of frontal body builds ranging from very thin to 
very fat. Individuals are typically asked to select the shapes that most represents their current and 
ideal body sizes (Gardner & Brown, 2010). However, many of the drawings with disproportionately 
sized arms and legs, poorly defined bodily features such as differential thickness between right and 
left arms, or a lack of separation between arms and bodies are unrealistic representations of the 
human bodies, quoted from Thompson and Gray by Gardner & Brown (2010).   
Human bodies are very complicate; female bodies exhibit multiple variations expressed in 
terms of body types or shapes. Females who have the same bust, waist, and hip circumferences may 
have different figure shapes (Kwong, 2004). Body types and shapes can be classified by using the 
somatotyping technique, the somatometry method, and the currently developing technology: 3-D 
body scanning. Body-type classification is used to develop proper stimuli for investigating 
body-type perceptions related to fit issues in the apparel field. Producing apparel that provides good 
fit for consumers has been a challenge since the introduction of mass produced garments. Garments 
that do not fit consumers cause lost sales and damage brand loyalty. Poorly fitted bras cause mild 
discomfort to more serious problems of muscle tension, fatigue, and pain. It is possible that female 
body shapes are related to bra fit. A better understanding of body shapes and characteristics could 
result in creating bras that provide good fit. The purpose of the current study was to apply stimuli 
with continuous figural scales of body shapes developed from 3-D body scanning technology to 1) 
investigated body shapes of Taiwanese college female participants, 2) determine whether or not the 
professional judges’ body-shape evaluation was different from participants’ self-perceived body 
shapes, 3) whether or not body-shape characteristics evaluated by the judges were significantly 
associated with female college students’ perceptions of bra fit.

body parts to the whole body. BSAS was equipped with the four categories of Body Build, Body 
Shape, Hip Shape, and Shoulder Slope from the frontal view; the five categories of Front Torso 
Contour, Bust Shape, Buttocks Prominence, Back Curvature, and Posture, all from the side view 
(Alexander, 2003). Alexander (2003) applied the BSAS software to analyze the body scans of 529 
women ages 19 to 55 years. She found that the majority of the bodies were identified as Average 
Body Build; the most prevalent Body Shape was Pear Shape; more than half of the subjects were 
Low Hip Level for the Hip Shape category; more than two-thirds of the scanned subjects had an 
Average Buttocks Prominence. In addition to the 3-D body-scanning system accompanied by BSAS, 
a few researchers used different types of computer software to study body shapes. For example, 
Simmons (2002) integrated with the [TC]² body-scanning system with the other computer software, 
Female Figure Identification Technique (FFIT). The concept behind the software was to compute 
the ratios of bust to waist circumference, hip to waist circumference, and hip to bust circumference 
for body-shape classification. Simmons (2002) applied the technology to categorize body shapes of 
228 Caucasian females, between the ages of 18 and 66, into Hourglass, Top Hourglass, Bottom 
Hourglass, Spoon, Rectangle, Diamond, Oval, Triangle, and Inverted Triangle. She found that the 
Bottom Hourglass appeared to be the most common shape. Chen, Labat, & Bye (2010) applied a 
3-D body scanner incorporated with the ScanWorX™ and Polyworks™ software systems to extract 
body angles and classified college females’ upper torso shapes, such as shoulder slope, bust 
prominence, back curvature and acromion placement, into various figure variations. One of Chen’s 
(2010) research objective was to help researchers create appropriate stimuli for investigating body 
shapes from consumers’ or apparel experts’ perspectives.  
 
Estimation of body Shape   
Difference between self-perceived and ideal body shapes   
Increasing popular in recent years have been the use of figures or silhouettes. Typically, 
participants match their perceived size from a varying number of line drawings, representing figures 
of silhouettes of varying widths (Gardner, 1996). Various research studied difference between 
self-perceived and ideal body types. Davis (1985) used the Perceived Somatotype Scale of Tucker 
(1982) to study difference between self-perceived and ideal body forms; 87.5% of the students felt 
that the ideal body forms were thinner than their bodies. Chen & Swalm (1998) used the nine-figure 
silhouette scale designed by Stunkard et al. (1983) to access self-perceived body shapes of 298 
Chinese and 180 American students. To examine the association of the subjects’ self-perceptions of 
body shapes with their body mass index, a Spearman rank-order correlation was calculated. Values 
for the Spearman correlations between perceived body shape and body mass indexes were moderate, 
so the subjects tended to estimate their body shape accurately. The findings were consistent with the 
 5 
related to the perceptual disturbances of body image. Using a digital body image computer program, 
191 participants (107 women, 82 men) adjusted an image of their body to the perceived actual size 
at five body regions; chest, waist, hips, thighs and calves. A neural object (a vase) was also adjusted 
to partial out the level of perceptual distortion present with a neutral object. Men and women 
overestimated the size o the neutral object and their body image. Among women, overestimation 
was primarily predicted by high levels of depression, and media and peer influences to be thinner 
and increase muscles. Among men, overestimation was predicted by high BMI, media influences to 
lose weight and increase muscles, and peer influences to increase muscles. These findings suggest 
that perceptual accuracy of body image is primarily predicted by biopsychosocial influences 
(McCabe et al., 2006).     
Discrepancies in estimating body image were associated with various techniques to asses 
whether participants underestimated or overestimated their body shapes (e.g., Brodie, Slade, & 
Rose, 1989; Cash & Brown, 1987; Gardner, 1996). Therefore, (Stanford & McCabe, 2002) 
employed a new computer-generated technique that was able to distort imaged of the individual’s 
own body and allowed the researchers to adjust individual’s body parts. McCabe et al. (2006) stated 
that the degree of estimation accuracy was measured by the percentage of overestimation and 
underestimation. This technique is superior to former methods, as it allows individuals to make the 
image wider or thinner an unlimited number of times, until they are satisfied that the image 
represents their “actual” size. The study compared the degree of estimation accuracy for specific 
body parts with the degree of estimation accuracy for the equivalent regions of an inanimate object, 
that is, a vase (McCabe et al., 2006).      
 
Body Shapes and Apparel Fit  
Alexander, Connell, & Presley (2005) studied fit problems of females with four self-perceived 
body shapes: Pear, Hourglass, Rectangular, and Inverted Triangular. They found that the participants 
perceiving their body shapes as Rectangular, Pear, and Hourglass were more likely to have fit 
problems at the bust area than those who identified themselves as of the Inverted Triangular shape. 
Furthermore, Pisut & Connell (2007) investigated the fit preferences of 1,026 American female 
consumers aged 19-55 in a national study. The most commonly self-perceived body shape in this 
sample was hourglass (33.6%), and rectangular (32.6%) was the next most commonly 
self-perceived body shape. In particular, participants with Rectangular and Pear shapes were less 
likely to buy fitted garments, while participants with Hourglass and Inverted Triangular shapes were 
more likely to prefer purchasing fitted clothing. Additionally, Feather et al. (1996) surveyed female 
basketball players about their self-perceived body types and fit problems with uniforms. These 
researchers concluded that body types were important factors affecting fit satisfaction; participants 
 7 
placement, shoulder slope, back curvature, bust prominence, and shoulder/waist relationship, with 
each category consisting of five-figure continuous scales. The three judges observed the 
participants’ body shapes and selected the figure variations that best represented their body shapes. 
At the second stage, the same stimuli were given to the participants. With the aid of mirrors, 
participants were able to make judgments of their body shapes and selected the figure variations 
they thought most resembled their own body shapes. At the third stage, the participants were asked 
to fill out the bra-fit questionnaire. 
 
Data analysis  
ANOVA design was employed to test whether the judges evaluated the participants’ body 
shapes differently. “Judges’ evaluation of participants’ body shapes” was a dependent variable 
identified as an interval-scale measurement, and the independent variable was “judge” (one, two, 
and three), a within-subject factor. With the attempt to control type I error, the Bonferroni multiple 
comparison was used to examine differences between possible pairs if the ANOVA test showed 
significant difference. Once one of the judges significantly evaluated body shapes that were 
different from the other two, her evaluation scores were eliminated and the other two judges’ scores 
were averaged and used to compare with the scores of participants’ self evaluation of their body 
shapes. Then, a pair t-test was applied to check if any statistically significant difference between the 
scores of judges’ body-shape evaluation and scores of participants’ self-perceived body shapes.   
In order to further test whether the judges’ body-shape evaluation related to bra fit rating, the 
averaged scores of the two judges’ body-shape evaluation were recoded into three groups of figure 
variations. After recoding, five-way ANOVA was employed to examine if the three groups of figure 
variations within each of the five categories were significantly different in the fit-rating topics: bra 
cups, bra straps, bra bands, bra support, and fabric and seamline comfort. Although a five-way 
ANOVA test was used to determine whether there were relationships existing, only main effects and 
two-way interactions were analyzed to avoid violation of the statistics assumption of equal variance 
(homogeneity). Therefore, the dependent variables were the added scores from the Likert-type scale 
given in each of the six topics, and the independent variables were acromion placement, shoulder 
slope, back curvature,  bust prominence, and shoulder/waist relationship based on the judges’ 
body-shape evaluation. When statistically significant difference was found to exist, a Post Hoc 
method, Bonferroni, was further used to perform multiple comparisons between group means.  
  
Results    
Body-shape evaluation     
Among these participants, 45.40% (n= 64) and 27.00% (n= 38) of them perceived their 
 9 
averaged scores of acromion placement that ranged from 1.00 to 1.50 were re-coded as scale one 
(forward), averaged scores ranging from 2.00 to 2.50 were re-coded as scale two (average), and 
averaged scores ranging from 3.00 to 3.00 were re-coded as scale three (backward) (Table 4). For 
the category of shoulder slope, averaged scores ranging from 1.50 to 2.50 were re-coded as scale 
one (sloped), averaged scores ranging from 3.00 to 3.50 were re-coded as scale two (average), and 
averaged scores ranging from 4.00 to 5.00 were re-coded as scale three (square).  
After the test of five-way ANOVA, results showed that there were significant two-way 
interactions between groups of shoulder slope and back curvature (F = 2.83, p = 0.03) and between 
groups of bust prominence and shoulder/waist relationship (F = 3.13, p = 0.02) in bra cups (Table 5). 
Figure 2 shows that the group of participants with round-back curvature in combination with sloped 
shoulders scored the highest mean value in bra cups; the group of the participants mostly agreed 
that their bra cups were well-fitted and they were most satisfied with their bra cups. In contrast, the 
participants with average back in combination with sloped shoulders were disturbed the most by the 
fit problem of bra cups, even though the participants with average-back curvature in combination 
with square shoulders scored the secondly highest mean value. There were also significant two-way 
interactions in bra cups between the bust prominence groups and shoulder/waist relationship groups. 
Figure 3 demonstrates that the group of small-bust participants with average shoulder/waist 
relationship was least bothered by the fit problem of bra cups. On the other hand, the group of 
participants with large bust along with broad shoulder/small waist had the lowest mean score; they 
were most dissatisfied with bra cups. Similarly, the group of participants who had large bust 
accompanied by small shoulder/ large waist scored the secondly lowest mean values.  
In addition, there were significant two-way interactions between the groups of acromion 
placement and bust prominence (F = 4.21, p = 0.00) and between the groups of shoulder slope and 
shoulder/waist relationship (F = 2.78, p = 0.03) in bra support (Table 5). Based on Figure 4, the 
large bust/backward acromion group had the highest mean score; the participants with large bust 
accompanied by backward acromions were most satisfied with bra support. The participants with 
small bust accompanied by backward acromions scored the secondly high mean value. In contrast, 
the large bust/forward acromion group scored the smallest mean value in bra support; this group of 
participants felt that their bras did not provide sufficient support. Another significant two-way 
interaction in bra support occurred between the shoulder slope groups and shoulder/waist 
relationship groups. Figure 5 indicates that the group of participants with average shoulder/waist 
relationship in combination with sloped shoulders had the highest mean score; this group of 
participants was most satisfied with their bras that provided proper support. On the other hands, the 
participants with small shoulder/large waist relationship accompanied by square shoulders were 
most dissatisfied with bra support. In general, the group of small shoulder/large waist proportion 
 11 
are squarer and wider and their bust and back shapes tend to be flatter.         
 
Discrepancy between judges’ body-shape evaluation and participants’ self-evaluation   
There are significant differences between judges’ body-shape evaluation and self-evaluated 
body shapes in shoulder slope and bust prominence. The judges perceived that the participants’ 
shoulders are much squarer and the judges felt that the participants’ chests are much flatter 
compared to the perceptions from the participants.  
 
Judges’ body-shape evaluations related to bra fit problems 
Previous research indicated that large-bust women were usually bothered by the fit problems 
of tight bra cups, so it is not surprising to find that participants with large bust are dissatisfied with 
their bra cups in this study. Particularly, the participants with protruded bust prominence along with 
broad shoulder/small waist or small shoulder/large waist proportions are very unhappy with their 
bra cups; they probably felt that their bra cups are tight. In addition, the group of sloped-shoulder 
participants with average back curvature has the lowest mean value in satisfaction with the bra cups.   
This group of large-bust participants is not only very dissatisfied with the fit of bra cups, but 
also the bras that are perceived as lack of sufficient support. In particular, the participants who have 
large bust along with the appearance of forward acromion felt most disappointed with the bra 
support. Meanwhile, the participants with small shoulder/large waist relationship accompanied by 
square shoulders are most frustrated by bras that are described as providing poor support compared 
with the other two groups of shoulder/waist proportions.  
The group of participants with average back curvature in combination with average shoulders 
is most dissatisfied with their bra seamlines around the bra cups; the participants agreed that bra 
seamlines are not comfortable, and they felt the seamlines around bra cups were abrasive to their 
chest walls. This group of average-back participants with average shoulders could possibly have a 
forward posture which causes the fit problems of loose bra cups. They also possibly have large 
under-bust circumferences or protruding ribcage against the bra seamlines, so their bra seamlines 
were perceived as uncomfortable.  
The reason might be that the group of participants would have an average sized under bust or 
small breasts, so they were not very much disturbed by bra seamlines. However, they are not the 
group scoring the lowest mean value. Participants with average-back curvature and average 
shoulder slope were most dissatisfied with seamlines comfort. Although those participants with 
average shoulder slope accompanied by broad shoulder/small waist were mostly dissatisfied with 
seamlines, the average shoulder slope accompanied by average shoulder/waist relationship was the 
second group who was frustrated by seamlines of their bras. However, the participants with average

的部份說明，然而跳躍式的報告方式則是讓人更迷惑且不易瞭解。其實報告者本身就應
該事前意識到被分配的時間有限，如何針對有限的時間將重點說明才是挑戰。我所準備
的內容簡潔明瞭，使我能在 10 分鐘內完成報告，我想在場的觀眾亦了解我的報告，因
為有人提出問題及下一些評論。在會場，我巧遇輔仁大學織品服裝系的系主任鄭靜宜老
師，她的學生也是其中的報告者。之後我聽了幾場有關產品開發及行銷的報告，多數的
報告仍著重在對於消費者心裡及社會文化層面探討，然而對於產品開發的部份卻是著重
在產品本身的特色及功能性探討，在人體體型及產品面仍未有太多的著墨，我個人覺得
這部份的研究是非常有潛力的，因為產品與使用者涵蓋的面很廣，不但是要從消費者心
理的領域切入，更應從工程面加以分析使用者生理的舒適度。 
在聆聽其他報告者的報告後，有一位觀眾對其中報告者提出很尖銳的問題，我覺得
很不可思議，因為報告只是交換一些研究的想法，或許報告的內容不是非常完整或正確
也無需批判，因為這只是一個研討會，而非學位發表的質詢。會後有一位報告者：Dr. 
Emine Ercan 和我討論到有關內衣的研究，她的研究內容是針對社會心理層面、身體
及女性內衣美感喜好的相關性所做的研究，她說她的下一個研究是有關於測試不同型式
內衣。  
 參加此次的研討會讓我大開眼界，也見識到韓國人的企圖心，規劃如此龐大的研討
會需要大量的人力，雖然研討會仍有部份不周全的地方，但整體而言，此次的研討會是
很成功的。
