摘要 
本研究主要目的在於探討美感與情感感是否受到色彩與形狀特徵之影響。為了達成研究目的，進行了
兩項實驗。在實驗一和實驗二中，將 13 顏色分別運用到多邊型以及倒圓角的四邊形，這 13 個色彩是
從 Berlin 以及 Kay 的 11 基本色名中選出，再加上橄欖綠色與藍綠色，讓色彩的選擇達到更好的覆蓋
率。形狀的製造主要是以 2種形狀特徵作為變因，多邊形之形狀邊數與形狀外框線之圓角的大小。請
受測者利用 7個情感量尺評定色彩和形狀的組合，包括“躍動─沉靜”，“溫暖的─寒冷的”，“複
雜的─簡單的”，“重的─輕的”，“柔軟的─堅硬的”，“喜歡的─不喜歡的”和“美的─醜的“。
結果顯示，“躍動─沉靜”，“溫暖的─寒冷的”與“重的─輕的”並未受到形狀之影響。另外，”
複雜─簡單”和”柔軟─堅硬”則受到形狀的影響。

Abstract 
The aim of study is to see if the shape attributes have impact on the color affective feelings. To fulfill 
this purpose, two experiments were conducted. Thirteen colors were applied onto the polygon shapes and 
the shapes having round corner in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. The used colors were selected from 
Berlin and Kay’s basic color terms together with cyan and olive colors to give a good coverage in the color 
space. The shapes selection aims to investigate the impact of shape attributes on affective feelings, including 
the numbers of shape edge and the sizes of round corner. These color-shape combinations were assessed on 
seven affective scales, including “active-passive”, “warm-cool”, “complex-simple”, “heavy-light”, 
“soft-hard”, “like-dislike” and “beautiful-ugly”. The results showed that the “active-passive”, “warm-cool” 
and “heavy-light” were not affected by shapes. The “complex-simple” and “soft-hard” feelings were found 
to take into account the shape attributes. 
 
Keywords: color, affective feeling, shape 
 
1. Introduction 
A product consists of many appearance attributes, 
such as color, shape, gloss and textures. These 
appearance attributes contribute to the people’s 
overall affective feelings. However, the previous 
color studies1-8 usually used color patches to carry 
out the experiment, completely ignoring that the

judgments from the experimental samples on 
“like-dislike” and “beautiful-ugly” scales. This 
implies that people’s preference (“like-dislike”) and 
aesthetics (“beautiful-ugly”) were not aroused by 
the shape attributes and colors used in the 
experiments. Hence, these two scales were 
excluded in the following analysis. 
A normal distribution was found on 
“active-passive”, “warm-cool”, “complex-simple”, 
“heavy-light” and “soft-hard” scales, where the 
mean results closer to Step 4 have higher RMS 
values. The mean results closer to Step 1 and 7 have 
smaller RMS values. This indicates that the better 
agreements for the mean results are close to the two 
ends. This suggests that the experimental samples 
evoking stronger feelings had better observer 
accuracy.

4. Results 
The mean results were used to explore the 
influences of colors and shapes upon affective 
feelings. First, the experimental samples were 
arranged in order along each affective scale to see 
how the observers judged the color-shape 
combinations on affective scales. The results are 
given in Figure 8. The color tendency toward 
affective feelings in Experiment 1 was found to be 
similar to those in Experiment 2, as shown in

8. Self-evaluation 
According to the literature survey, the color affective feelings were proved to have three principle factors. In 
the current study, the shape influence was found to have impact on the color affective feelings. For design 
evaluation, the current results tell us that the aesthetic of product can be evaluated. But, there are several 
issues still remain unclear. For example, is there any interaction between color and shape influence? What if 
other appearance attributes appeared on the product surface, i.e., gloss, texture.   
In general, this study successfully proved that the shape influence is existed in the affective feelings and 
aesthetics. In the future, the current results and method can be applied to the affective feelings of total 
appearance.

Abstract 
The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of colors and fonts upon affective feelings. Two 
experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 used the fonts in black color, which was printed on a 
white paper. The affective feelings of fonts were revealed by displaying the classification of fonts on 
an affective space, which was constructed by two underlying affective factors. Experiment 2 used 
color-font combinations to see how colors influenced the affective feelings of fonts. The results 
showed that “warm-cool” was determined by colors only. The feelings of “friendly-serious” and 
“heavy-light” were mainly affected by colors. The “complex-simple”, “beautiful-ugly” and 
“like-dislike” feelings were found to be affected by fonts. The “soft-hard”, “active-passive”, 
“luxury-plain” and “causal-regular” feelings were influenced by both colors and fonts.

1. Introduction 
Fonts are extensively used in various design works such as products, graphics and packages that we can 
see in our daily life. The fonts were used for delivering the information; meanwhile, the appearance of 
typeface determines how a design work looks like, especially for graphic designs or packages. 
However, in nowadays, there are more than 100 types of fonts in a PC, and thousands of fonts on the 
internet that we can download free. Font selection is no longer a problem for design. But how to choose 
a suitable typeface for design becomes critical. 
Considering the affective feeling of design, this study conducted two experiments to see how typefaces 
and colors influence affective feelings. 
 
2. Experimental Plan 
Two experiments were carried out. The outline of two experiments is given in Table 1. Experiment 1 
investigated the influence of font shapes upon affective feelings. On the ground of the results from 
Experiment 1, six representative fonts were furthermore used to explore the influence of color-font 
combinations upon affective feeling. Thirty-one and thirty-two observers with normal color vision 
took part in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively.

2-1. Affective scale 
Eight affective scales were used in Experiment 1, including “friendly-serious”, “complex-simple”, 
“soft-hard”, “beautiful-ugly”, “luxury-plain”, “active-passive”, “casual-regular” and “like-dislike”. For 
Experiment 2, “warm-cool” and “heavy-light” were involved, because these two affective scales were 
seen as the essential scale for color affective feelings. A 7-step categorical judgment method was used 
for data collection in the two experiments, as shown in Figure 1. 
 
2-2. Font selection  
In Experiment 1, the 47 fonts were selected to cover four basic classifications of font (serif, sans serif, 
script, and other), as given in Table 2. Note that these fonts were usually free installed in the Window 
Vista. On the ground of the results obtained from Experiment 1 (see section 3. Results), six 
spectrophotometer. The CIELAB values were calculated under CIE D65 and 1964 standard 
colorimetric observers, as shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. 
 
2-4. Experiment process  
Each observer was presented with the black and colored fonts in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. 
These fonts were against white paper and illuminated by a D65 simulator with a luminance level of 
218cd/m2. The viewing distance was about 45cm from each observer’s eyes to the fonts with a 0/45 
illumination/viewing geometry. In the experiment, the fonts were judged using a 7-step scale (see 
Figure 1) in relation to the affective scales by each observer. Chinese language was used during the 
experiment. 
The sentence of “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” was used, because this sentence 
includes all the 26 letters. The drawback of this sentence is short of numbers and marks. Hence, this 
sentence, number and marks were combined together. Additionally, the sentence in capital was also 
used in the experiment. Figure 3 shows the refined sentence, the samples could be close to the reality.

3. Observer accuracy 
To see how well the individual observer agrees with mean results, RMS (Root Mean Square) was used 
to examine the observer accuracy. The RMS equation is given below: 
n
YXRMS ii
2)(   
where Xi and Yi are the observer’s judgements and mean results for each sample i , respectively; n is 
the number of sample. For RMS of 0, it represents the individual observer’s judgements agree 
perfectly with the mean results. 
The observer accuracy of Experiments 1 and 2 were illustrated in Figure 4 .
