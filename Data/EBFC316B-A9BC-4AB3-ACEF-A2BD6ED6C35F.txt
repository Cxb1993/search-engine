DC bias voltages of the amplifiers from passing through the couplers to the RF input and output ports.
Instead, if trans-directional couplers are used, the four large capacitors are not needed since the input
and output of trans-directional couplers are isolated. The bond-wires in the Lange couplers are also
avoided. Unlike branch-line couplers, implementation of trans-directional coupled-line couplers is never
found in the literature as far as the author know.
In 2009, the author has proposed a periodically-loaded coupled line [8] to realize a novel trans-
directional coupled-line coupler. The required conditions of even- and odd-mode impedances and phase
velocities to reach trans-directional operation are derived. In general, it is impossible to meet these
conditions because both the impedances and phase velocities are all affected by the spacing between the
coupled lines at the same time. Therefore, it is difficult to adjust one parameter without changing the
others. To overcome this problem, periodically loaded coupled lines are employed to replace the original
coupled lines. By adjusting the periods and the load impedances of the new coupled lines, the required
conditions for trans-directional operation can be easily met. The idea of adding one or two shunt loads
at the ends or centers of contradirectional coupled lines has been proposed in [9]-[11]. However, its
purpose is to improve directivity by compensating the difference between even- and odd-mode phase
velocities. Similar structures based on composite right/left handed (CRLH) transmission lines have also
been proposed to increase the bandwidth or coupling factors of contradirectional coupled-line couplers
[12]-[15]. Unlike the lumped-element approximation of CRLH transmission lines, the exact formulation
including the effect of transmission lines is derived in this paper. Therefore, our formulation is not
subjected to the limitation of electrically small cell sizes as in the CRLH transmission-line formulation.
Compared with original coupled-line couplers, besides the usual benefits of trans-directional coupled-
line couplers, our structure also can achieve higher coupling factors under the same manufacturing
constraints and shorter electrical lengths.
Although we have successfully implemented trans-directional couplers, the potential of the formula-
tion of the periodically-loaded coupled-line is not fully explored in [8]. The purpose of this proposal is
to extend our work in periodically-loaded coupled-lines. We have successfully fullfilled the goals of this
proposal. The general analysis of parallel coupled-lines is first given in Section 2. The formulation of
the periodically-loaded parallel coupled-lines is derived in Section 3 by Block mode theory. In Section 4,
our previous work of trans-directional coupled-line couplers are discussed and demonstrated. Section 5
shows our proposed work of the periodically-loaded parallel coupled-lines. Section 6 gives the simulated
and measured results. Finally, the conclusion is given.

trans-directional coupler.
Consider the coupler shown in Fig. 1(a). Since the coupler is symmetrical, its scattering parameters
can be derived by two-port even- and odd-mode analysis as shown in Fig. 1(b). Let Seij and S
o
ij be the
even- and odd-mode S-parameters of the coupler, respectively, where i, j = 1, 2. Then, the four-port
S-parameters can be expressed as:

2. Contradirectional (isolation at port 4)
The required condition is
S14 = S23 = 0,
which leads to
Se21 = S

21. (15)
From (8), (15) can be satisfied if
θe − θo = 2npi, (16)
where n is any integer. Note that only impedance coupling is in effect since the difference between
the even- and odd-mode phase delays is any integer multiple of 2pi. Substitute (16) to (2) and (3),
we have
S21 = S
e
21 (17)
S31 = S

11. (18)
The coupling factor C is defined by
C = |S31|
This type of coupler is also called backward coupler since the coupled wave propagates in the
opposite direction of the input wave.
3. Trans-directional (isolation at port 2)
The required condition is
S12 = S34 = 0,
which leads to
Se21 = −So21. (19)
From (8), (19) can be satisfied if
θe − θo = (2n+ 1)pi, (20)
where n is any integer. It is obviously that both impedance and phase coupling are needed for
this case. Substitute (20) to (3) and (4), we have
S31 = S
e

S41 = S

The forward coupling and backward coupling factors Cfor and Cback are defined by
Cfor = |S41|
Cback = |S31|
3 Analysis of Periodically Loaded Coupled Lines
Fig. 2a shows the equivalent circuit of a transmission line periodically loaded with a normalized shunt
admittance b. Let θ′ be the electrical length of each unit cell and Z ′0 the characteristic impedance of the
transmission line. Directly from [7], [16], the ABCD matrix of one cell is

bo = BoZ

′, (36)
and
Bs =
Bo − Be
2
(37)
Be and Bo can be implemented by suitable lumped loads or open/short stubs. Note that there are
5 unknowns (θ′, be, bo, Z
′
0e and Z
′
0o) but only 4 equations. This allows us to assign a value to one of
the variables directly. For example, the value of θ′ can be adjusted freely to find practical values for the
possible realization of Z ′0e, Z
′
0o, Be and Bo. From (31) and (32), be and bo are found and then Z
′
0e and
Z ′0o can be solved from (33) and (34). Finally, Be and Bo are calculated from (35) and (36). Notice that
Eq. (16) of [8] is inadequate since it does not consider the condition B < 0 and C < 0 at the same time.
To find the correct Bloch mode characteristic impedance for all conditions, (33) and (34) must be used.
This is also the reason why not all the combinations in Table I of [8] give trans-directional operation
even though they all satisfy (20).
For a real parallel couple-lines, the possible Ze0 and Z
o
0 are restricted by manufacturing constrains.
For instance, on a PCB made of 1.6 mm thick FR-4 substrate, Ze0 can not be higher than 120 Ω due to
the limitation of the finest line width. At the same time, the coupling factor can not be higher than 10
dB due to the limitation on the narrowest gap between lines. Therefore, it is not possible to implement
3-dB 90 ◦ hybrid by microstrip lines on a PCB. Moreover, it is also not possible to adjust θe, θo, Z
e
0 and
Zo0 freely at the same time to meet the required condition for each type of coupler. For example, the
separation distance of a microstrip coupled line affects the above four parameters simultaneously. But,
with the formulation in Section 3, by adjusting the periods and the load impedances of the new coupled
lines, we can freely synthesize the bloch mode characteristic impedances and phase constants to satisfy
our need. Following is a list of possible applications of previous formula.
1. Coupling factor enhancement.
For contradirectional and trans-directional couplers, Ze0 and Z
o
0 determine the coupling factors. As
mentioned previously, possible Ze0 and Z
o
0 are limited by the finest line width and the smallest gap
between lines. For a microstrip contradirectional coupler, the largest coupling factor realizable on
a 1.6 mm FR-4 substrate is about 10 dB, far less then the required value 3 dB for a 90 ◦ hybrid.
With the Bloch mode formulation, we can achieve higher coupling factor by synthesizing Bloch
impedances.
2. Shortening the length of coupled-lines.
The maximum coupling factor of a contradirectional or trans-directional coupled-line occurs when
the electrical length is 90 ◦. Larger or small than 90 ◦ reduces the coupling factor. For microstrip
coupled-lines, due to their weak coupling, 90 ◦ electrical length is always chosen to achieve the
maximum coupling factor. In our periodically-loaded coupled-line formulation, the physical length
of the coupled-line needs not to be 90 ◦ to achieve the maximum coupling factor. As demonstrated
in [8], a 60 ◦ 3-dB hybrid was successfully implemented.
3. Realization of codirectional and trans-directional coupled-line couplers.
For microstrip coupled-lines, only contradirectional couplers are possible to be implemented. Our
formulation makes it possible to synthesize the required Bloch mode characteristic impedances
and phase constants to realize all three types of couplers according to (11), (16) and (20).
4. Pure phase coupling or impedance coupling.
In a real microwave circuit, for instance, the microstrip lines, both phase and impedance couplings
exist at the same time. However, as derived in Section 2, contradirectional couplers require pure
impedance coupling, while codirectional couplers require pure phase coupling. In reality, the
unwanted impedance or phase coupling degrade input match and isolation. In [9]-[11], one or two
shunt capacitors are added to compensate the phase coupling in a contradirectional coupler. Our
formulation here is more general and can be applied to compensate the impedance coupling in a
codirectional coupler.

In the following sections, three published 3-dB 90 ◦ hybrid prototypes are briefly introduced. For
detail, please see [8] and [17].
4.1 3-dB 90 ◦ Hybrids Implemented by Periodically Loaded Coupled Lines
To achieve 3-dB coupling and match to 50 Ω lines, the required Ze0 and Z
o
0 are 120.7 Ω and 20.71 Ω,
respectively. If the total physical length Nθ′ are equal to 90 ◦ and N = 3 is selected, we have Ce = 0 and
Cs = 990.7 fF. However, due to the parasitic effect of lumped capacitors, a real 990.5 fF capacitor will
not give the expected result. Instead, after including the circuit model provided by the manufacturer,
Murata GRM1555C1HR75CZ01D 750-fF capacitor was found to give the closest capacitance at 3.6 GHz.
The circuit was fabricated on a 1.524 mm FR-4 substrate with soldered surface-mounted capacitors. The
circuit layout and dimensions are shown in Fig. 3a. A photo of the fabricated circuit is shown in Fig. 3b.
Comparison of the measured and computed S-parameters is shown in Fig. 4. Very good results are
achieved.

4.2 Shortened 3-dB 90 ◦ Hybrids Implemented by Periodically Loaded Cou-
pled Lines
To demonstrate the capability of our design in shortening the length, a 90 ◦ hybrid operating at 3.6
GHz and implemented by a 3-cell trans-directional coupled line with only 70 ◦ total transmission line
length was designed. By using (19), (20), (21) and (23), the computed parameters can be found to be
Ze0
′ = 156.7Ω, Zo0
′ = 100.3 Ω, Ce = 74.37 fF, Cs = 984.5 fF. To relax the required narrow width for the
implementation of the high coupled-line characteristic impedances Ze0
′ and Zo0
′, the circuit is fabricated
on a 1.575 mm Roger RT/duroid 5870 substrate with a low dielectric constant of 2.33. The required
Ce value was implemented by periodically placing open stubs at each section as shown in Fig. 5a. The

4.4 Summary
In summary, from previous results, the following advantages and disadvantages of our proposed couplers
can be given.
• Advantages
1. Size reduction.
First, our couplers can replace branch-line couplers in high-coupling factor application. Thus,
the size is reduced from an area of λ/4 × λ/4 to λ/4 in length. Second, the lengths of our
couplers can be smaller than 90 ◦ electrical length as shown in previous section.
2. Cost reduction.
For microstrip contradirectional couplers, the output ports are on the different sides of the
coupler. Sometimes it is necessary to use vias or bond-wires to route the signal path as in
a Lange coupler or a Butler matrix. Another solution is using broadside coupling. However,
this also increases cost due to the use of multilayer structures. All these increase cost and vias
and bond-wires degrade performance at higher frequencies due to their parasitic effects. On
the contrary, the output ports of our trans-directional couplers are at the same side, avoiding
the connection issues.
3. Coupling factor enhancement.
For microstrip contradirectional couplers, the coupling factor is always limited by fabrication
constants and cannot achieve 3-dB coupling unless broadside coupling is used, which adds up
10
by microstrip coupled lines. However, its bandwidth is quite narrow comparing to Marchand baluns.
In this paper, we found that by simply substituting the contradirectional couplers in this balun by
trans-directional couplers [2], the balun characteristics were retained while much wider bandwidth was
achieved. Also, since the trans-directional couplers are implemented by parallel coupled-line sections
with periodic shunt capacitors [8], the need of tight coupled-line sections are avoided, making it possible
to be realized on single PC board layer under fabrication constraints.
Fig. 8a shows the configuration of the proposed balun. It consists of two 3-dB TRD couplers with
the through port of the first coupler connected with the coupled port of the second coupler. The two
balanced output ports are the coupled port of the first coupler and the through port of the second one,
respectively. By using Agilent Advanced Design System 2008 circuit simulator, the characteristics of the
trans-directional baluns are compared with that implemented by conventional contradirectional couplers
[28]. Fig. 8b shows the comparison of the input return losses. Although the 3-dB trans-directional case
has narrower bandwidth than 3-dB contradirectional case, it still has about 41% 10-dB bandwidth,
wide enough for practical use. The amplitude imbalance and phase difference are shown in Fig. 9.
It can be seen that due to the use of trans-directional couplers, the proposed baluns have a slower
changing region from 0.8 GHz and 1.2 GHz than that realized by contradirectional couplers. Both the
amplitude imbalance and phase difference of our proposed baluns have a smooth region around the
center frequency and then a big jump at the edges of this smooth region, while the phase differences of
contradirectional baluns approach inclined straight lines. This explains why even though baluns realized
by contradirectional couplers have been proposed by [28], they have not been put to use due to their
steep phase responses. This simulated results have verified the plausibility of forming a planar balun by
two trans-directional couplers on a single substrate.

6 First Year Achievements
The goal of the first year is to utilize the proposed TRD coupler to implement three devices, i. e.,
the Marchand balun, the Butler matrix and the relfection phase shifter. So far, we have succeeded
in implementing all three devices. The results of our Marchand balun has been published in IEEE
Transactions on Microwave Theory and Tehcniques [37]. The detailed of these three devices is presented
in the following subsections.
6.1 Planar Marchant Baluns Implemented by Trans-directional Couplers
We have derived the formulation of the proposed balun. The characteristics of the balun is also analyzed.
Two prototypes are designed and built to verify the design concept. Following paragraphs will show the
design and measured data.
The first prototype was constructed by two 3-dB couplers fabricated on a FR-4 substrate with
dielectric constant 4.3, loss tangent 0.02, and thickness 1.52 mm. The even- and odd-mode impedances
of the coupled-line sections are 120.72 Ω and 77.29 Ω, respectively. The capacitor is realized by Murata
1.5-pF capacitor which gives the closest capacitance value to the design value 1.486 pF computed by
the equations in [8]. Fig. 12(a) and (b) shows the size and photograph of the prototype. The circuit size
is about 37 mm × 2.4 mm. The simulated and measured results of the S-parameters, phase difference
and amplitude imbalance are shown in Fig. 13. The simulated results are generated by first simulating
the circuit without the capacitors by Momentum [38] and then exporting the result to the ADS circuit
simulator to incorporate the Murata capacitor model. Using 180 ◦±5 ◦ phase difference and 10-dB input
return loss as the criteria, the measured bandwidth is from 1.94 GHz to 2.69 GHz, which is corresponding
to 32% fractional bandwidth. The amplitude imbalance and insertion loss are smaller than 0.76 dB and
5.6 dB in this frequency range, respectively. The insertion loss of both output ports are about 3.4 dB
near the center frequency.
Similar to the first prototype except the coupling factor is 4.8 dB and the substrate thickness is 0.76
mm, the second prototype demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the balun size at lower frequency by
meandering the coupled lines. The photograph of the prototype is shown in Fig. 14. The impedance and
the width of the microstrip lines are 96.59 Ω and 0.37 mm, respectively. The required capacitors were
realized by Murata 6.0 pF capacitors which give the closest capacitance value to the design value 6.636

coupling effect is only contributed by periodic shunt capacitors. This makes it possible to meander
the transmission lines to reduce the circuit size without significantly degrading its performance. The
experimental results proved the proposed baluns did show in practical application the advantage of easy
fabrication with simply single-layer PCB technology.
6.2 Phase Shifter Implemented by Trans-directional Couplers
A reflection phase shifter is implemented by the proposed TRD couplers with two varactors. The Taiwan
digit TV broadcasting frequency band (510–620 MHz) is chosen as the design operating frequency.
Fig. 16 shows the schematic and the photo of a 60 ◦ 3-dB TRD coupler fabricated on a FR4 substrate
with dielectric constant 4.3, loss tangent 0.02, and thickness 1.52 mm. At a center frequency of 565 MHz,
a traditional λ/4 3-dB coupler will be prohibitively large. However, by using our proposed periodically
loaded couplers, we are able to reduce the electric length from 90 ◦ to 60 ◦, a 1/3 reduction. The even-
and odd-mode impedances of the coupled-line sections are 183.74 Ω and 117.26 Ω, respectively. The
computed shunt capacitance value is 6.27 pF. However, due to the limited availability of capacitance
values and not ideal frequency response of a lumped capacitor at higher frequency, we found the Darfon
6.8-pF capacitor gave the closest result to the ideal case. The simulated and measured results of the
returned loss and isolation are shown in Fig. 17. The measured results are all smaller than 15 dB in the
required frequency band. The simulated and measured results of the forward and backward coupling
levels are shown in Fig. 18. The measured results are all within -2 dB to -4 dB in the required frequency
band. The simulated and measured results of the amplitude and phase differences of the two coupled
ports are shown in Fig. 19. The measured result satisfies an amplitude difference of 0.4 dB and a phase
difference of 90 ◦ ± 5 ◦ in the required frequency band. All in all, the simulated and measured data are
in good agreement and a successful design of a 3-dB TRD coupler in the required frequency band is
achieved.
Next, two varactors are added to the TRD coupler to form a reflection phase shifter as shown in
Fig. 20. DC bias circuits are also shown in the figure. The make and model of the varactors is NXP
BB189 which has a measured tuning range of 1.876 pF to 33.74 pF when bias voltage range is 0 V
to 25 V. Due to the DC isolation between the input and coupling ports of the TRD coupler, only one
136.3 pF capacitor is needed to serve as a DC block. Fig. 21 and Fig. 22 shows the comparison of the
simualted and measured return loss and insertion loss of the phase shifter at 0-V and 25-V bias voltage,
respectively. As can been seen, the return loss are all smaller than 10 dB while the insertion loss are
all smaller than 1.37 dB. Good agreement between simulated and measured results are also achieved.
Fig. 23 shows the difference of the measured phase of S12 at 0 V and 25 V. A 120
◦ tuning range is
achieved in the required frequency band. The computed figure of merit is 87.6 ◦/dB.
In conclusion, we have succeeded in implementing a reflection phase shifter by a TRD coupler. By
using the TRD coupler, the circuit length is reduced by 1/3 and a 3-dB coupling factor is achieved.

學術會議心得報告 
長庚大學電子工程學系助理教授鄭瑞清 
 
HSIC 2012 為本校博祥教授發起的高速智能通訊論壇，其主題包含 millimeter 
wave integrated circuits and systems, sensor network, optical communications and 
MIMO/OFDM systems。除第一屆由長庚大學主辦外，第二屆由新加坡南洋科技
大學主辦，第三屆由香港城市大學主辦。今年是第四屆，由南京東南大學主辦，
自 5/10 至 5/11 共二日，共計 64 篇論文，以及 22 個 invited talk。會議的地點在
東南大學附設的九龍湖賓館。我負責主持的是第二天上午的 post session，但是高
瑄苓老師希望和我對調，因此改為第二天下午的第一個 invited talk session。 
 
我們一行人搭乘 5 月 9 日下午 5:20 東方航空公司的班機，在 7:00 左右到逹南京
祿口國際機場。東南大學派出專車，直接接我們到飯店。第一天的 session 結束
後，是東南大學九龍湖校區的參訪活動。其校地之大(3700 畝) 令人咋舌，實在
是在台灣的我們所難想像。該校歷史悠久，至今年已校建校 110 年。第二天早上
的傅老師的紀念 session，由 4 位傅老師的好友，分享和他的事蹟。會議結束後，
晚上南京理工大學電子工程和光電技術學院設宴款待，因此有機會進南京市區。
南京是一個綠意盎然的城市，路旁行道樹甚多，因歷史悠久而有很多參天古木，
其中最多的樹種為油桐。南京理工大學校園內，可見到許多五、六層樓高的油桐。 
最後一天早上參觀明孝陵和中山陵，然後坐 2:30 東方航空公司的班機回台。明
孝陵是明太祖朱元璋的陵寢，環境清幽，參觀人數並不多，我們還以為觀光客不
多。到了中山陵，發現人山人海，原來遊客都在這裏，可見大陸人對國父孫中山
先生比較感興趣。中山陵位在山丘上，建築宏偉，寬廣的階梯由山下拾級而上，
規模和明孝陵比起來，大得多。還有大大的中華民國 4 個字，刻在石碑上，這大
概是大陸上唯一可以看到這個景象的地方。在機場等飛機時吃午餐，一罐雪碧人
民幣 38 元，餛飩麵人民幣 78 元，真是貴得離譜。因為這是我第一次到大陸，所
以有一些觀察。腳踏車和機械腳踏車多，喇叭聲也多，櫃台人員（例如旅館、機
場 check-in 和海關等）服務態度和台灣比起來較差。台灣的很多網站，例如中國
時報、Yahoo、PC Home 等都連不上，連回學校時也非常慢。 
 
香港城市科技大學的薛泉教授提出一個新的傳輸線結構，稱為 dielectric 
microstrip line。其概念是以高介電常數物質取代微帶線的金屬部分，包括 ground  
plane，藉此免除 ohmic loss，減少電路在高頻的損耗。如此的結構在傳統上是無
法支持無損的傳波，所以不曾被用做波導。因此會後我向薛教授請教，他也承認，
該結構並非無損波導，也有截止頻率和 dispersive 的問題。我想，在適當的設計
下，損耗可降至最低，因此仍有機會做為波導，特別是在高頻的應用上。薛教授
也介紹一些和傳統平面傳輸線（如 CPW、Microstrip 等）之轉接結構，但是其中
