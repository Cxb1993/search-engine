2000 年香港大學 H. S. Kwok 等提出 Comb-on-plate BTN7-9（COP-BTN）LC device，其
雙穩態的扭轉角度亦是相差π，除了需要 Binem LCD 的特殊邊界性質之外，還需要細緻的

流動效應，便完成穩態之間的轉換機制。但此三端電極的製造，對成本與良率亦有負面的
影響。 
韓國 J. C. Kim 等在 2003 年提出 Bistable chiral-splay nematic LC device10（SCBN-LC），

To analysis the movement of directors, we extend the simulator developed in our lab16 to 
calculate the detailed dynamic behaviors of the director of DFLC in the BHN LCD.  In the 
Ericksen–Leslie–Parodi theory, the hydrodynamic equations couple the director reorientation 
with the flow of the liquid crystals.  We solved these equations by using relaxation method and 
neglect the inertial term of directors.  The boundary directors are rigidly anchored in the x-axis 
with a pretilt angle.  The flow is restricted to the plane of the cell (vz = 0) with no-slip boundary 
conditions (vx = vy = 0 at z = 0 and d).  The transient directors (nx, ny, nz) and their velocities (vx, 
vy, 0) are function of z only.  The optical transmittance is obtained by using Jones matrix 
calculus under a cross-polarizer condition with one of the transmission axis in the x-axis.  Table 
I shows the parameters used in the simulation.  Due to lack of the Leslie coefficients of 
MLC-2048, these coefficients are taken from the values of MBBA.  The time step of the 
simulation is 10−5 second, the dielectric anisotropy is changed from Δε1 to Δε2 at t = 0 and we 
assumed that all the parameters but the dielectric constants of DFLC are the same when the 
applied frequencies are f1 and f2.  The dynamics physical pictures of the directors and 
corresponding induced flow velocity profile at 1 ms after changing the applied frequency are 
plotted in Fig. 2.  Figure 3(a) illustrates the dynamic director configurations of the BHN LC cell 
projected in the x–y plane after changing the applied frequency and Fig. 3(b) depicts the director 
configurations of TH, BH, T, BT states. 
While the cell is under the field of E1, the directors are vertical in the center part of the cell 
and exhibit largest elastic distortion near the substrates.  As the applied frequency suddenly 
changed to f2, the directions of elasext ττ rr +  are in the +y direction near both substrates according to 
eq. (2) and the tilt angle of the directors.  Through the viscous interaction17,18 of liquid crystals, 
the direction of the induced translational motion in the upper half of the cell is opposite to the 
lower half of the cell.  The gradient of the induced flow velocity imposes a viscous torque visτr  
to the directors. Since the directors on the central part of the cell are vertical, the electric and

Fig. 4.  The measured (a) and simulated (b) transmittance curves of the switching process.  
The cell is switched from BH state to T state by using the switching pulses of 5 V with 
the frequency changed from 1 kHz to 100 kHz. 
 
In our study, we use two connecting pulses to switch BHN LC cell from TH state to T state.  
The intention of the first pulse is to pull the directors vertical.  Without the second pulse, it is a 
simple switching waveform for BTN LCDs from the homogeneous state to twisted state.  The 
elastic restoring torque is the only source to induce flow at the end of the pulse in its switching 
mechanism.  In the BHN LC cell, when we add the second pulse of high frequency to DFLC, 
the flow effect is enhanced by both the elastic restoring and electric torques.  Therefore, a 
smaller applied field can achieve the switching from TH state to T state.  Moreover, the field of 
the second pulse continues adding a force to accelerate the directors moving to T state therefore 
the switching time is shorter.

Figure 1 sketches the textures of two stable states in the
lower row, two biased states in the upper row, and the tran-
sition processes of BHN LC cell. The dash lines illustrate the
process from the twisted state T state to the tiltedly homeo-
tropic state TH state. That is when the cell is in the T state,
which is depict at the lower right corner of Fig. 1, a vertical
electric field pulse with a low frequency f1 pulls the LC
molecules vertically since the liquid crystals possess a posi-
tive dielectric anisotropy 1 at this frequency. The cell is
switched to the biased homeotropic state BH state. Once
the voltage is off, the directors relax to TH state. To switch
back to T state, which are drawn by the solid lines in Fig. 1,
we first apply a pulse with frequency f1 and the cell is back
to BH state. Then, followed immediately by another pulse
with a high frequency of f2, in which the liquid crystals
possess a negative dielectric anisotropy 2 at the very fre-
quency, the cell is switched to the biased twisted state BT
state. When the voltage is off, the directors relax to T state.
In the following, we use the Ericksen-Leslie-Parodi theory15
to analyze the dynamic behaviors of the directors of DFLC
in the BHN LCD from TH state to T state.
When we switch the BHN LC cell from TH state to T
state, we first applied a field of E1= 0,0 ,E1z with frequency
f1 for a period of time until the external director body

where Eiz is the electric fields in z axis of the first and second

induced flow in the BHN LCD. Compared with conventional
bistable LCD, the source to induce flow can only be one of
them.
To analyze the movement of directors, we extend the
simulator developed in our laboratory16 to calculate the de-
tailed dynamic behaviors of the director of DFLC in the
BHN LCD. In the Ericksen-Leslie-Parodi theory, the hydro-
dynamic equations couple the director reorientation with the

using relaxation method and neglect the inertial term of di-
rectors. The boundary directors are rigidly anchored in the x

the cell vz=0 with no-slip boundary conditions vx=vy =0

mittance is obtained by using Jones matrix calculus under a
cross-polarizer condition with one of the transmission axis in

tion. Due to lack of the Leslie coefficients of MLC-2048,
these coefficients are taken from the values of MBBA. The
