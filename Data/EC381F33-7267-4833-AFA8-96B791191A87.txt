Abstract 
 
This project is based on NSC94-2213-E-230-006. 
In this project, we study the parametric 
well-posedness for vector equilibrium problems 
and propose a generalized well-posed concept 
for equilibrium problems with equilibrium 
constraints (EPEC in short) in topological vector 
spaces setting. We show that under suitable 
conditions, the well-posedness defined by 
approximating nets is equivalent to the upper 
semicontinuity of the solution mapping of 
perturbed problems. Further, since optimization 
problems and variational inequality problems are 
special cases of equilibrium problems, related 
variational problems can be adopted under some 
equivalent conditions. Finally, we also study the 
relationship between well-posedness and 
parametric well-posedness. 
Keywords: (Perturbed) bilevel optimization, 
(perturbed e -)variational inequality, (perturbed) 
EPEC problem, approximation solution, vector 
equilibrium problem, upper-semicontinuous, 
well-posedness, almost convexity. 
 
??????? 
The concept of well-posedness is closely 
related to stability, approximation and numerical 
analysis. An initial concept of well-posedness 
introduced by Tykhonov, was given in scalar 
optimization problem (see [3]). Since then many 
kinds of well-posedness concepts and 
applications in game theory and vector 
optimization problems were studied (see [2]). 
Extensions of well-posedness to other related 
problems, such as fixed point problems (see [11]), 
variational inequality problems (see [12]) and 
 4 
 
where  is the set of upper bounds of 
, that is 
 
(ii) for each z , the level set 
 
is convex or empty. 
Remark 1. First statement is defined by Luc and 
the second is by Ferro. Some readers recall the 
following Helbig’s definition which is stronger 
than Luc and Ferro’s definition. When Z is locally 
convex space and C is closed, the definition is 
equivalent to C-naturally quasiconvex defined by 
Tanaka. 
Definition 2 (see [4]). Let X be a vector space, and Z 
also a locally convex space with a partial ordering 
defined by a closed pointed convex cone C. Suppose 
that K is a convex subset of X and that f is a 
vector-valued function from K to Z. Then, f is said to 
be (Helbig’s) C-quasiconvex on K if for every 
 and , and each'  
 
where  stands for the topological dual cone of C. 
Definition 3 (see [4]). Let X be a vector space, and Z 
also a vector space with a partial ordering defined by a 
pointed convex cone C. Suppose that K is a convex 
subset of X and that f is a vector-valued function from 
K to Z. Then, f is said to be C-properly quasiconvex on 
K if for every x1, x2  K and [0, 1] we have 
either 
 
or  
f is said to be strictly C-properly quasiconvex on K if 
for every x1, x2  K and (0, 1) we have either 
 
or  
Remark 1. In real-valued functions, ordinary 
quasiconvex function is also properly 
quasiconvex. 
Definition 4 (see [13]) Let X be a topological space, 
and Z a topological vector space with a partial 
ordering defined by a solid pointed convex cone C. 
Suppose that f is a vector-valued function from X to Z. 
Then, f is said to be C-continuous at x  if it 
satisfies one of the following three equivalent 
conditions: 
(i)  is open. 
(ii) For any neighborhood  of f(x), there 
exists a neighborhood  of x such that 
 for all . 
(iii) For any , there exists a neighborhood 
 of x such that  for all 
. 
Moreover a vector-valued function f is said to be 
C-continuous on X if f is C-continuous at every x on 
X. 
Remark 2. C-continuity and (-C)-continuity are 
the same as ordinary lower and upper 
semicontinuity, respectively, whenever  
and . With corresponding to ordinary 
functions, C-continuous function is called 
C-lower semicontinuous function, and 
(-C)-continuous function is called C-upper 
semicontinuous function. 
Definition 5 (see [1]). Let X and Y be two 
topological spaces, T :  a set-valued mapping. 
Then T is said to be lower semicontinuous (l.s.c. for 
short) at  if for each open set V with 
, there is an open set U containing x such 
that for each  T is said to be l.s.c. 
on X if it is l.s.c. at all . 
Definition 6 (KKM-map). Let X be a topological 
vector space, and K a nonempty subset of X. Suppose 
that F is a multifunction from K to . Then F is said 
to be a KKM-map if 
 
for each finite subset  of X. 
 6 
(i) f(p,·, y) is (-C)-continuous on X for each , 
; 
(ii) f(p, x,·) is C-quasiconvex on X for each , 
. 
Then the problem VEPp has at least one solution for 
each . 
Theorem 2. Let X be a nonempty compact convex 
subset of a real Hausdorff topological vector space , 
and Z a real topological vector space with a solid 
pointed convex cone . Let  be a nonempty 
set. Suppose that f is a vector-valued function from 
 to Z with  for all 
and . Also we assume the following 
conditions: 
(i) f(p,·,y) is (-C)-continuous and strictly 
(-C)-properly quasiconvex on X for each , 
; 
(ii) f(p,x,·) is C-continuous and C-quasiconvex on X 
for each , . 
Then the problem VEPp has a unique solution for each 
. 
Furthermore, we will illustrate the condition of 
parametrically uniquely well-posed for the VEPp 
in the following theorem. 
Theorem 3. Let X be a nonempty compact convex 
subset of a real Hausdorff topological vector space , 
and Z a real topological vector space with a solid 
pointed convex cone . Let  be a topological 
space. Suppose that f is a vector-valued function from 
 to Z with  for all 
and . Also we assume the following 
conditions: 
(i) f(·,·, y) is (-C)-continuous on  for each 
; 
(ii) f(p,·, y) is strictly (-C)-properly quasiconvex on X 
for each , ; 
(iii) f(p, x,·) is C-continuous and C-quasiconvex on X 
for each , . 
Then  is parametrically uniquely 
well-posed. 
As an application of closeness result of 
solutions map for VEPp above, we investigate the 
existence and the well-posedness of solution for 
an EPEC problem as follows: Let W be a 
topological vector space with a solid pointed 
convex cone D. 
 
where S is an equilibrium constraint. We use the 
notation  for the mapping F in the rest 
of the paper, where  is a 
vector-valued function. 
We define the following solution mapping 
 of e-approximate 
problem of EPEC as 
 
An element of  is called an e-solution of 
EPEC. Similarly, we can choose f(p,x,y) = g(p,y) - 
g(p,x). Another choice is set 
 where f:  
and , is the space of all continuous 
linear operators from X to Z. Then the parametric 
vector equilibrium problems are reduced to the 
parametric vector optimization problems and 
vector varitational inequality problems, 
respectively. Similar to definitions 7-9, we can 
define the following concept for EPEC. 
Definition 10. A net  is said to be an 
approximating net for EPEC iff there exists 
 with  such that 
 
where  is an equilibrium constraint. 
Definition 11. EPEC is said to be well-posed iff 
(i) EPEC has at least one solution; 
(ii) Every approximating net for EPEC has a subnet 
convergence to  which is a solution of 
EPEC.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the  -vector equilibrium problem ( -VEP in short). Several existence results for  -
VEP were established. We also investigate continuities of the solution mapping of  -VEP. In particular, a 
result concerning the lower semicontinuity of the solution mapping of  -VEP is presented.
Keywords:  -Vector equilibrium problem; vector equilibrium problem; C-quasiconvexity; C-continuity; C-compactness
