Recently, the use of terahertz (THz) technology and its devices have increased significantly in a 
wide range of applications. Control of THz wave in its temporal shape or spectral distribution is a 
prime purpose. Quasi-optic components such as THz phase shifters and gratings are essentially 
for modification of THz wave. In this work, the tunable phase shift of 378.7° at 1 THz is 
demonstrated using electrically controlled birefringence in a vertically aligned nematic liquid 
crystal (NLC, E7) cell, 1830 μm in thickness. The driving electric field is 90.5 V/cm. On the 
basis of that, a tunable NLC phase grating has been demonstrated first time. The broadband 
terahertz pulse waveform in time domain is modified by electrically or magnetically controlling 
the refractive index of E7. With fast Fourier transformation algorithm, the power spectrum could 
also be obtained. At the zeroth and the first orders diffraction positions, the phase grating could 
be used as a tunable beam splitter, and the beam splitting ratio for the 0.3-THz-beam can be 
changed from 10:1 to 1:1 for the electrically controlled phase grating. The beam splitting ratio is 
changed from 4:1 to 1:2 for the magnetically controlled phase grating.

In a uniform electric field approximation, E can be written as V/L. Equations (3) and (4) allow us 
to calculate the profile of molecular orientation in the cell for a given applied electric field. 
For experiments of shaping and splitting THz beam with phase grating, the phase grating we 
proposed in this work is a binary phase grating. Two materials, fused silica and NLC E7, with 
different refractive indices are adopted and periodically arranged. The diffraction effect of the 
phase grating could be predicted by the classical diffraction theory. The electric fields pass

constructed by sandwiching the E7 (Merck) layer between two fused silica substrates. Two 
copper pieces (purity of 99.94%) worked both as spacers and electrodes for the cell. They were 
parallel to each other and separated by L=11.0±0.3 mm. In Fig. 1 (b), the two compartments of 
the cell are filled with E7. The copper pieces were separated by L=10.2±0.3 mm. Compared to 
the use of two cells, the sandwiched cell has two less air-silica interfaces. The reflective losses 
are reduced. The substrates of (a) and (b) were coated with DMOAP for vertical or homeotropic 
alignment. The thickness ds and dd of the E7 layer are 1.83 mm and 1.012 mm for each layer, 
respectively. A square-wave ac voltage at 1 kHz was applied to the electrodes to avoid domain 
formation. The applied voltages quoted in this paper are all rms values. The phase shifting 
properties of this device was characterized by a photoconductive-antenna-based THz-TDS. The 
measurements were done at room temperature (23±0.5°C).

bolometer. The MHA is used as a filter, and the broadband THz pulse was filtered to yield a 
quasi-monochromatic wave centered at 0.3 THz [9].

According to Eq. (1), larger phase shift is expected at higher frequencies. This is confirmed in Fig. 
4 (a) and (b), in which we plot the phase shifts from 0.2 to 1.0 THz by varying the driving 
voltages. For a given voltage, the measured phase shift varied linearly with frequency, with a 
slope of 346.8°/THz at 100 V in sample (a) and 362.6°/THz at 45 V in sample (b), respectively.

(B) Grating 
The zeroth order diffraction transmitted signals of electrically controlled phase grating are 
time-resolved by THz-TDS as shown in Fig. 7 (a). THz beam is normally incident a fused silica 
bulk without E7 as a reference cell and the phase grating device with two different E7 refractive 
indices. The pulse waveform has been varied when the THz beam pass through the phase grating 
with the refractive index of E7 changed from no to ne. With FFT algorithms, the normalized 
diffraction intensities in frequency domain are shown in Fig. 7 (b). The solid and dashed lines are 
theoretical curves calculated by eq. (7) for the ordinary and extraordinary waves, respectively. 
The experimental data fit well with the result predicted by classical diffraction theory, except in 
the range of 0.3 THz to 0.4 THz. We realized there are some effects caused by the ITO films, and 
we are still studying on it. By electrically changing the refractive index of E7, the range of 
changed diffraction efficiency is largest at the frequency of 0.3 THz and 0.5 THz, which is 
corresponding to our design. At 0.3 THz, when the refractive index of E7 is no, the phase 
difference Δφ between the fused silica and E7 is close to 2π. Therefore, the transmission of the 
grating is larger. The THz wave is mostly propagated to the zeroth order diffraction position. On 
the contrary, when the refractive index of E7 is ne, the phase difference Δφ is close to π. It has a 
smaller transmission because the THz wave is mostly propagated to the first order diffraction 
position.

Summary 
In summary, an electrically tuned 2π phase shifter at 1 THz has been achieved by using 
electrically controlled birefringence in a NLC. The phase shift can be tuned electrically by 
controlling the effective refractive index of NLC layer. Measured results are in agreement with 
theoretical predictions. In comparison with single and dual NLC layer devices, the response of 
the device scales with the square of its thickness. In principle, the sandwiched structure should 
respond much faster. Although the electrically controlled NLC THz phase shifter has many 
advantages, we should point out that it is difficult to tune the desired phase shift accurately near 
the threshold. Further, the response of the device is slow, due to its thickness. It is thus not 
suitable for applications that require fast modulation. Instead, the device is excellent for 
instrumentation or apparatus that require a fixed phase with occasional fine tuning. Then, the 
electrically and magnetically controlled LC phase gratings for modulating the THz wave at room 
temperature are demonstrated. The waveform of the broadband THz wave is modified in 
time-domain and the spectrum transmittance can be varied in frequency-domain. For the single 
frequency THz wave, the phase grating can be used as a beam splitter, and the beam splitting 
ratio can be tuned. About the work of the “Electrically Tunable Room-Temperature 2π Liquid 
Crystal Terahertz Phase Shifter”, the paper is already published in IEEE Photonic Technology 
Letters (18, 1488, 2006). As for the work of the “Terahertz Beam Splitting by Tunable Liquid 
Crystal Phase Grating”, the paper is accepted in Frontier in Optics (FIO) 2007 the 91st OSA 
Annual Meeting. The achieved percentage of scheduled progress of whole project is almost 
finished. And more results are under investigation.

shrinking of the smectic layers which occurs at the transition from the orthogonal (director parallel to 
the layer normal ) Sm-A* phase to the tilted Sm-C* (or Sm-Ca*) phase. As the layers are positionally 
anchored at the surfaces, they will then buckle in a chevron geometry which is the only one compatible 
with the new combination of surface and bulk conditions. Accompanying the development of the chevron 
structure is the formation of so-called 'zig-zag' defects and a reduction in effective optical tilt angle, 
effects which seriously degrade the quality of any electro-optic device. 
     
The exact connection between director tilting and layer thickness change is however still not fully 
understood, and different materials show varying degree of shrinkage as a result of the tilting transition. 
In fact, a number of FLC materials displaying virtually constant smectic layer spacings have been 
identified, and these materials ("de Vries materials") have therefore come to receive a substantial 
interest from industry as well as academia. An understanding of why such de Vries materials do not 
show a shrinkage of the layers at the Sm-A* -- Sm-C* transition, and why others do, is not only a key 
issue for the development of FLC and AFLC electro-optic devices, but it is also extremely interesting 
from a fundamental research point of view.  
  
 
3. FLC display: Although the FLC display had been demonstrated near 20 years ago, the lacking of 
good mass production process has dragged it from market. In this conference a group lead by 
Professor Junichi Kobayashi has reported their product by using processes suitable for mass 
production.
