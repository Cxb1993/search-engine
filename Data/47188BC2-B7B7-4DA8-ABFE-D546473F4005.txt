The notations of ≥˙ and ≤˙ are similarly defined. The exponent d∗nt,nr(r) is
commonly known as the DMT [9] and is given by a piecewise linear function
connecting the points (r, (nt− r)(nr − r)) for r = 0, 1, · · · ,min{nt, nr}. Fur-
thermore, d∗nt,nr(r) represents the largest diversity gain that can be achieved
by any point-to-point ST codes under Rayleigh block fading channel when-
ever the channel remains static for at least a block of nt channel uses [4] and
varies independently from one block to another.
For other types of fading statistics, the CDA-based ST codes are also
known [4] to be capable of achieving the optimal error performance in such
channels that include Rician, Weibull and Nakagami as special cases. ST
codes that are optimal in all fading statistics are coined approximately uni-
versal codes [4, 10].
If coding across independent fading blocks is allowed, the multi-block
CDA code [6] has been shown to be approximately universal as well. In
particular, it achieves codeword error probability

at multiplexing gain r, where m is the number of independent fading blocks
occupied by the code. The exponent m · d∗nt,nr(r) is known as the multi-
block DMT [6, 9] when coding is applied over m independent fading blocks.
Therefore, the multi-block CDA-based ST code is optimal in terms of the
multi-block DMT at high-SNR regime. More important, (1.3) indicates that
the code has error probability decreasing to zero as m approaches infinity
whenever d∗nt,nr(r) > 0. Hence, the multi-block ST code could potentially
achieve the MIMO ergodic channel capacity at high-SNR regime and simul-
taneously be optimal in terms of the multi-block DMT at every discrete value
m.
Motivated by the promising outcome in the point-to-point scenario, the
aim of this report is to investigate the code construction for the multiple-
access channel (MAC) scenario. We will concentrate on the uplink transmis-
sion from multiple mobile users to a common base station (or access point).
Both the mobile users and the base station may be equipped with multiple
antennas.
Consider a MIMO-MAC with K mobile users. For simplicity, we first fo-
cus on the case of symmetric MIMO-MAC [11], where each user is equipped
with nt transmit antennas and communicates independently to the base sta-
tion that has nr receive antennas. Furthermore, we assume that all the
8
where d∗knt,nr(kr) is the point-to-point DMT for knt transmit antennas, nr
receive antennas and multiplexing gain kr defined as before (or see [9, 11]).
Equation (1.6) is termed optimal symmetric MAC-DMT. The multiplexing
gain r for nonnegative diversity gain is bounded between
0 ≤ r ≤ min
{
nt,
nr
K
}
= rmax. (1.7)
Compared with the point-to-point scenario, the decrease of maximal mul-
tiplexing gain by a factor of K (see nr
K
in rmax of (1.7)) is due to the sharing
of nr receive antennas among K users and the fact that d
∗
Knt,nr
(Krmax) = 0.
Equation (1.6) also shows that when the level of multiplexing gain is low
such that r ∈ [0,min{nt, nrK+1}], each user is able to retain his single-user
performance, i.e., d∗nt,nr,K(r) = d
∗
nt,nr(r), as if there were no other users in the
channel. On the other hand, when the level of multiplexing gain is high and
r ∈ [min{nt, nrK+1} ,min{nt, nrK }], the MIMO-MAC system would operate
in the antenna pooling region [11], and single-user performance can no longer
be maintained. As a consequence, a much lower diversity gain d∗Knt,nr(Kr)
dominates the error performance in this region.
In Fig. 1.1 we demonstrate the above facts of the symmetric MAC-DMT
for the case of K = 3 users, nt = 2 and nr = 2. It can be clearly seen that
the turning point between the single-user and antenna pooling regions is at
r = min
{
nt,
nr
K+1
}
= 1
2
and the cut-off point of r is at min{nt, nrK } = 23 .
The construction of MAC-DMT optimal codes calls for a coding scheme
that independently encodes, but simultaneously transmits, each mobile user’s
information over the MIMO channel such that at receiver end, the decoding
of all users’ signals achieves the best possible error performance dictated by
the MAC-DMT. Thus, a coding scheme is called MAC-DMT optimal if it
achieves the following error performance under joint decoding

1.1 Prior Work
Several works have been reported in this area. Nam et al. [12] presented the
first MAC-DMT optimal scheme using a class of structured multiple-access
10
each user, based on independent Alamouti blocks [2] is also introduced
in [13]. Yet, we remark that such code does not achieve the optimal
symmetric MAC-DMT (1.6).
2. In [14] Badr and Belfiore proposed an explicit algebraic code for K = 2
and nt = 1. The idea can be extended to bigger values of K. The deter-
minant of the code matrix is non-zero thanks to a ”twisting element.”
However, the determinant is vanishing. The decay of determinants of
this two-user MIMO-MAC code was carefully studied in [15]. It was
shown that the code is MAC-DMT optimal, when r ≤ 1
5
. Whether this
code achieves the optimal MAC-DMT also when r > 1/5 remains an
open question. In [15] it was shown, however, that the code fails to
satisfy the criteria for achieving optimal MAC-DMT set forth in [16],
when r > 1/5. This alone does not mean that their code could not be
optimal, as the criteria in [16] is sufficient, but not necessary (see [17]
for justification of this claim).
3. Some explicit, algebraic code constructions for nt > 1 and K = 2 were
introduced by Hong and Viterbo in [18]. A design criterion based on
an approximation of truncated union bound was proposed. With such
criterion they constructed a code that outperforms in error performance
the aforementioned (4× 4) two-user code [13].
4. Badr and Belfiore [19] proposed another (4× 4) two-user MIMO-MAC
code which is obtained by adding a twist matrix Γ to the (2 × 2)
Golden ST code [20, 21] such that the overall code matrix is non-
singular whenever all the submatrices associated with each user are
nonzero. However, because of this additional Γ matrix, the overall
code matrix, though nonsingular, could be ill-conditioned at high-SNR
regime, thereby resulting in a vanishing determinant, similarly as did
their earlier one-antenna code [14] already discussed above.
5. [22] addressed the problem of whether there exists a two-user MIMO-
MAC code satisfying the non-vanishing determinant (NVD) property.
This problem concerns whether the twisted Golden MIMO-MAC code
[19] can be further improved to avoid the disadvantage of having a
vanishing determinant. The answer is negative. [22] shows that if all
the overall code matrices are nonsingular whenever the submatrices

1.3 Outline
A general result on the nonexistence of NVD MIMO-MAC codes is presented
in Section 2. This result suggests that the design criterion proposed by
Coronel et al. [16] might be too strict to yield any MAC-DMT optimal codes.
A relaxed design criterion is then provided in this section.
In Section 3, we present a new code construction for the symmetric
MIMO-MAC for any K, nt and nr. Several nice properties of the proposed
code are presented in this section. We prove that this newly proposed con-
struction is MAC-DMT optimal and meets the relaxed design criterion given
in Section 2. For ease of reading, the proof of MAC-DMT optimality is
relegated to Section 5.
In Section 4 we investigate the MAC-DMT in a general MIMO-MAC
where the users are allowed to have different numbers of transmit anten-
nas and transmit at different levels of multiplexing gain. The exact general
MAC-DMT in such channel will be given in Section 4.2, and it will be seen
that unlike the symmetric case, some users in the general MIMO-MAC are
no longer able to achieve their single-user performance even if the multiplex-
ing gains of other users are extremely close to zero. The reasons for such
unexpected result will be carefully explained therein. Finally, in Section 4.4
the newly proposed code construction for symmetric channels will be ex-
tended to cater to the general MIMO-MAC. The MAC-DMT optimality of
the generalized construction will be presented in Section 6.1.

Since the right-hand-side of (2.2) has a negative SNR-exponent equal to
d∗nt,nr,K(r) defined in (1.6), (2.2) proved the achievability of MAC-DMT
claimed by Theorem 1 based on the argument of Gaussian random code-
books.
We next turn our attention to the deterministic ST codes. From the
point-to-point perspective, it is known [4] that ST codes satisfying the NVD
property have the same error probability as the outage events. Thus, for any
MIMO-MAC code {S0, · · · ,SK−1}, set
Ck =
{
1
κ
Sk : Sk ∈ Sk
}
where
κ2
.
= SNR
1− r
nt .
To see how κ is chosen, we offer the following insight. For each k, the code Ck
has size |Ck| = |Sk| = SNRrT so that it is of multiplexing gain r. An explicit
construction of Ck was given in [4] where the code is seen as a real algebraic ST
lattice code with dimension 2ntT . Hence there are |Ck|
1
2ntT = SNR
r
2nt PAM
signals selected from each dimension and ‖Ck‖2F ≤˙ SNR
r
nt for all Ck ∈ Ck.
Thus, the constant κ is chosen such that the code Sk = κ Ck satisfies the
power constraint (1.4).
From [4], it is easy to prove the following theorem which in turn gives
a sufficient criterion for designing MAC-DMT optimal codes. We remark
that this theorem is an alternative statement of the result given in [16] un-
der certain restrictions, and we refer the interested readers to [17] for the
connections.
Theorem 2 ( [16]). Let C0, · · · , CK−1 be given as above. For any Im =
{i0, i1, · · · , im−1} ⊆ {0, 1, · · · , K − 1}, let CIm be the product concatenation
of Ci0 , · · · , Cim−1, defined by

 .
If for all pairs of distinct code matrices Cij 6= C ′ij ∈ Cij , j = 0, 1, · · · ,m− 1,
16
Roughly speaking, the proof of Theorem 3 shows that while it is possible
to construct DMT-optimal codes C0, · · · , CK−1 for each user, as the existing
CDA-based ST codes [4] would do, it is impossible for the product code
C0 × · · · × CK−1 to have an exactly full NVD. Any such product code would
have difference matrices ∆CIm such that det(∆CIm∆C
†
Im) is extremely close
to zero at high-SNR regime. In terms of conventional rank and coding gain
design criteria of ST codes, this means that even if the code achieves full
diversity gain, it necessarily loses significantly in coding gain. Therefore, it
becomes meaningless to say that the code achieves full rank and full diversity.
We may conclude that the exactly full NVD condition is in practice too strict
to yield MAC-DMT optimal codes.
Another implication from the proof of Theorem 3 is that the exactly full
NVD condition can be met only if the users cooperate in their transmission.
Without cooperation, the exactly full NVD condition can never be met and
the determinant must be vanishing.
On the other hand, we may relax the exactly full NVD condition without
adversely affecting the DMT performance. To do so, we will partition the
error events in a different manner. Given the set of users Im, let En(Im),
1 ≤ n ≤ m, denote the error event when the users in Im are in error
and the corresponding error matrix ∆CIm (cf. (2.3)) has rank exactly nnt.
Clearly event E(Im) defined in the proof of Theorem 2 is a disjoint union
of E1(Im), · · · , Em(Im). Now the codes C0, · · · , CK−1 are jointly MAC-DMT
optimal if the following holds.
Theorem 4 (Relaxed design criterion). Let C0, · · · , CK−1 be defined as above.
Then they are jointly MAC-DMT optimal if the error events En(Im) have
probabilities upper bounded by
Pr {En(Im)} ≤˙ SNR−d∗nnt,nr (nr) (2.4)
for all 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ K and for all Im ⊆ {0, 1, · · · , K − 1}. Furthermore, as
for design of MAC-DMT optimal codes we require at least that
Pr {En(Im)} ≤˙ SNR−min{d∗nt,nr (r),d∗Knt,nr (Kr)} (2.5)
for all 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ K and for all Im.
While (2.5) might be the most relaxed condition for designing MAC-DMT
optimal codes, in this report we will focus on condition (2.4).

Chapter 3
MAC-DMT Optimal Code
Construction for Symmetric
MIMO-MAC Channels
For the symmetric MIMO-MAC coded system with K users, each having nt
transmit antennas and transmitting at multiplexing gain r, in this section we
will propose a systematic code construction that is MAC-DMT optimal for
any combinations of K, nt, nr, and r. The construction does not assume any
cooperation among the users. Furthermore, compared with the MAC-DMT
optimal two-user code proposed in [22] where a sign change is required in
the code matrices, here in the proposed method each user encodes his own
information using an identical encoder. This greatly simplifies the hardware
implementation of these encoders.
3.1 Proposed Construction
Given the number of users K, let Ko be the smallest odd integer such that
Ko ≥ K, i.e.,
Ko =
{
K + 1, if K even,
K, if K odd.
(3.1)
The construction calls for the following number fields. Let Ko = F(ηo) be a
number field that is a cyclic Galois extension of F = Q( ı ) with degree Ko,
where ı =
√−1. Let L = F(θ) be another cyclic Galois extension of F with
degree nt. Let σ and τo be the generators of Galois groups Gal(L/F) and
20
unimodular. See [29] for such example construction. Should it be the case,
we could set ζ = γ, and the discussion below can be easily modified to show
that the MAC-DMT optimality of the proposed constructions remains to hold.
Therefore, for simplicity, here we will focus only on the case of ζ = γ
γ∗ .
Remark 3. We note that by construction the Galois groups of the numbers
fields are
Gal(E o/Ko) = 〈σ〉 ,
Gal(E o/L) = 〈τo〉 ,
Gal(E o/F) = 〈τo, σ〉 = 〈τo〉 × 〈σ〉 ,
where in the last line 〈τo〉×〈σ〉 denotes the direct product of the groups gener-
ated by τo and σ, respectively. It should also be noted that the automorphisms
τo and σ commute, i.e.,
τoσ = στo
due to the direct product of two groups.
Given multiplexing gain r, let A(SNR) be the base alphabet defined as
A(SNR) =
{
a+ b ı :
−SNR r2nt ≤ a, b ≤ SNR r2nt ,
a, b ∈ Z, a, b odd
}
;
then the corresponding information set is
Ao(SNR) =
{
nt−1∑
i=0
zi
Kont−1∑
k=0
xi,kek : xi,k ∈ A(SNR)
}
, (3.5)
where {e0, · · · , eKont−1} is an integral basis of E o/F. It should be noted that∑Kont−1
k=0 xi,kek ∈ E o for xi,k ∈ A(SNR) ⊂ OF and that Ao(SNR) ⊂ Do. Let
ψo : Do →Mnt(E o)
be the left-regular map that maps elements in Do into (nt × nt) square ma-
trices with entries in E o. Specifically, given u ∈ Do with
u =
nt−1∑
i=0
ziui, ui ∈ E o,
22
Remark 4. The above construction of the MIMO-MAC codes is reminis-
cent of the multi-block ST code presented in [6]. Some key differences are
highlighted below.
1. In the proposed construction we require the length of the code to be
nt ·Ko where Ko must be an odd integer.
2. The number fields Ko and L are required such that the automorphisms
σ and τo commute. This was not needed in [6].
3. The element ζ of the CDA Do must be unimodular, and we have set
ζ = γ
γ∗ .
We use the following example to illustrate the proposed construction.
Example 1. We consider the case of K = 2 and nt = 2. By construction
Ko = 3 is the smallest odd integer such that Ko ≥ K. Then it can be
shown that with θ = e ı
pi
8 and ηo = 2 cos
(
2pi
7
)
the number fields L = F(θ) and
Ko = F(ηo) meet the required conditions of [L : F] = 2, [Ko : F] = 3 and
L ∩Ko = F. Furthermore, we have η3o + η2o − 2ηo − 1 = 0. The generators σ
and τo for the Galois groups Gal(L/F) and Gal(Ko/F) are given respectively
by
σ : θ 7→ −θ and τo : ηo 7→
(
η2o − 2
)
= 2 cos
(
4pi
7
)
The set {1, θ, ηo, θηo, η2o , θη2o} is an integral basis for E o/F.
As the prime ideal (2+ ı ) of Z[ ı ] remains inert in OKo and OL, following
from [4] this gives an appropriate nonnorm element γ = 2 + ı . Hence we
have ζ = 2+ ı
2− ı . With E o = F(θ, ηo), Do = (E o/Ko, σ, ζ) is a CDA of index 2
which is also a central simple Ko-algebra [26]. Next let
ui = xi,0 + θxi,1 + ηoxi,2 + θηoxi,3 + η
2
oxi,4 + θη
2
oxi,5
for i = 0, 1 with xi,j ∈ A(SNR). The Galois conjugates of ui are for example
given by
σ(ui) = xi,0 − θxi,1 + ηoxi,2 − θηoxi,3 + η2oxi,4 − θη2oxi,5,
τo(ui) = xi,0 + θxi,1 + η

trivial automorphism. The field L and the element θ are defined as before.
The element xi is taken from the cyclic division algebra D = E ⊕ z′E for
some indeterminate z′. A(SNR) is the base-information set defined similarly
as Ao(SNR) in (3.5). Thus, compared with the present proposed construction,
we see that S2 requires an additional sign change at the second block matrix of
the second user’s code. This sign change is essential to ensure an NVD-like
property. It also endows S2 with another nice property that the transmission
of code matrices in S2 takes only 2nt channel uses, less than that required by
S. However, this additional sign change might complicate system design as
the system must constantly check which user requires a sign change and which
user does not. Such disadvantage does not exist in the proposed construction
of S. Everything works perfectly after patching an extra block of transmission
when K is even. Another drawback of S2 is the difficulty of generalization to
the cases of K > 2.
Let Hi be the (nr × nt) channel matrix of the ith user. We assume Hi
is fixed for a block of ntKo channel uses. Following (1.5), given the overall
transmitted code matrix S ∈ S, the received signal matrix at receiver end is[
Y0 · · · YKo−1
]
=
[
H0 · · · HK−1
]
S +W. (3.12)
W is the noise matrix whose entries are i.i.d. CN (0, 1) random variables,
and Yj is the jth block received signal matrix given by
Yj := κ

= (−1)nt(Ko−1) det(Co) = det(Co),
where the last equality follows from the fact that Ko − 1 is even, hence the
claim (3.17) is proved. Next, we show
σ(det(Co)) = det(Co). (3.18)
To this end, define
Z = ψo(z), (3.19)
where z is the indeterminate defined as in (3.2). Since from (3.4) xz = zσ(x)
for all x ∈ E o, it is clear that σ(X) = Z−1XZ, where X = ψo(x). Now we
have

= det(Co),
where we have used the fact that τo(Z) = Z since 0 6= ζ ∈ F by construction.
Thus, as det(Co) is fixed by both τo and σ, we see that det(Co) ∈ F = Q( ı ).
28
Proof. To find out the rank of matrix Co, we use the elementary row opera-
tions from Gaussian elimination method. Note that the same row operations
can be performed on C whose entries are in Do. Extra care must be taken
because multiplication in Do is non-commutative. Further, we note that el-
ementary row operations on C are equivalent to the block elementary row
operations on Co. By this we mean that, say P is a (Ko × Ko) elementary
matrix with entries in Do; then it is clear
Ψo (PC) = Ψo(P )Co,
where Ψo is the natural extension of ψo to the (Ko×Ko) central simple matrix
algebra MKo(Do) over Do [26], i.e.,
Ψo(P ) = [ψo(Pi,j)] . (3.22)
From hypothesis, assume {x>i0 , · · · , x>im−1} is the maximal subset of the rows
of C that are linearly independent over Do. Then it follows that there are m
leading ones in the row-reduced matrix of C. Equivalently, the same block
elementary operations Ψo(P ) would reduce matrix Co into a matrix whose
main diagonal consists of m identity matrices, each of size (nt × nt), after
permuting the columns if necessary. This completes the proof.
Property 2 shows that the overall code matrix Co ∈ Co might not always
have full rank Kont, and the rank of Co is always a multiple of nt. This is not
too much of a surprise as it is straightforward to see that in (3.13) if some
Xi’s are identical, then the overall code matrix Co cannot be nonsingular.
Compared with the constructions proposed in [18, 19], the matrix Co of
the present construction could be singular even when the component matrices
Xi are all distinct and nonzero as shown by Property 2. Nevertheless, we
will prove in Section 5 that in order to achieve the optimal MAC-DMT
performance at high-SNR regime, it is unnecessary to construct codes such
that Co is nonsingular whenever all the component matrices Xi are distinct
and nonzero.
Before rigorously proving the above statement, a heuristic way to see
this is the following. Since the users communicate independently to the

Without loss of generality we can assume that m linearly independent users
are the first m users and ij corresponds to the jth user, j = 0, 1, · · · ,m− 1.
Hence the covariance matrix of the sub-vector N s = [N1, · · · , Nmnt ]> equals
EN sN †s = CsC†s .
We have the following inequality for the differential entropies of N and N s

Notice that the covariance matrix of N can be decomposed as

for some (Kont × Kont) unitary matrix U . Σ is a diagonal matrix whose
nonzero entries are the βi’s. Thus setting N
′ = UN we have
h(N) = h(U †N ′) =
mnt∑
i=1
log βi +mnt log(2pie).
Now combining the above results proves the first inequality in (3.26). The
second inequality in (3.26) follows directly from Property 3 and from |γ| .=
1.
Remark 6. The above property shows that despite Co can be singular, the
product of the nonzero eigenvalues of CoC

o is always bounded from below by
1. This can be regarded as a relaxation of the conventional NVD property. In
the design of ST codes, satisfying the NVD criterion is a sufficient condition
to achieve the optimal point-to-point DMT performance. To guarantee NVD
in the point-to-point MIMO, we require all the users to cooperate fully as
already seen in Theorem 3. However, it is not allowed in MIMO-MAC where
users transmit independently their own information to the common receiver.
Thus, in MIMO-MAC we do not demand full NVD, and only partial NVD is
required as shown in (3.26).

Chapter 4
MAC-DMT Optimal Codes for
General MIMO-MAC Systems
In [11], Tse et al. focused on analyzing the DMT in a symmetric MIMO-
MAC system. By symmetric we mean that every mobile user in the system
has the same number of transmit antennas and transmits at the same level
of multiplexing gain. However, the symmetric MIMO-MAC might not be
practical enough. In the near future, the mobile communication is likely
to be at a transition stage, migrating from conventional SISO (single-input
single-output) to MIMO. In fact, such transition already takes place in wire-
less local area networks where some old laptops have single transmit antenna
while the latest ones could have more than two transmit antennas. In the
mixture of SISO and MIMO communication environment, one would expect
the mobile users having different numbers of transmit antennas. Further-
more, in practice it is often possible that mobile users transmit at different
rates because of the different plans they purchase from the service provider.
The different rate implies a different level of multiplexing gain in the DMT
sense. It is then of fundamental importance that we must have a general
code construction that works for any MIMO-MAC systems where the mobile
users are allowed to have different numbers of transmit antennas and can
transmit at different levels of multiplexing gains. In the previous sections we
have provided a systematic construction for the symmetric MIMO-MAC and
have proved that it achieves the optimal MAC-DMT. Below we will extend
these results to the general channel.
36
4.2 MAC-DMT for General MIMO-MAC with
Joint Decoding
Consider a general MIMO-MAC system with K mobile users. Let ni denote
the number of transmit antennas of the ith user, i = 0, 1, · · · , K − 1, and let
ri be the corresponding multiplexing gain. Assuming nr receive antennas at
the base station, the first major result of this section is the following.
Theorem 7 (General joint MAC-DMT). Let K, ni, ri and nr be defined as
above. If joint decoding is performed at receiver end, the optimal MAC-DMT
of such system is given by
d∗{n0,··· ,nK−1},nr(r0, · · · , rK−1) = minI d
∗
Nt(I),nr
(∑
i∈I
ri
)
(4.3)
for i.i.d. Rayleigh block fading channel that is fixed for at least
T ≥
[
K−1∑
i=0
ni
]
+ nr − 1 (channel uses).
The minimization in (4.3) is taken over all possible non-empty subsets I ⊆
{0, 1, · · · , K − 1}, and
Nt(I) :=
∑
i∈I
ni (4.4)
is the total number of transmit antennas of users in I. The notion of d∗p,q(r)
is the conventional point-to-point DMT.
Prior to proving Theorem 7, we shall give an example illustrating this
theorem and in particular, show some unexpected effects resulting from joint
decoding.
Example 2. For simplicity, here we consider a general MIMO-MAC system
with two users. The first user has n0 = 1 transmit antenna and transmits
at multiplexing gain r0; the second user has n1 = 2 transmit antennas and
transmits at multiplexing gain r1. Assume there are nr = 2 receive antennas

denote the actual transmission rate of the ith user. Given the subset I of
users, let O(I) denote the following outage event
O(I) :=
{
H ∈ Cnr×N : I (SI ; y|SIc , H) ≤ ∑
i∈I
Ri
}
, (4.5)
where
• H = [H0 · · · HK−1] is the overall channel matrix, Hi is the channel
matrix of size (nr × ni) of the ith user,
• N is the total number of transmit antennas defined by
N :=
K−1∑
i=0
ni,
• SI contains the transmitted signal vectors of users in I and is defined
as
SI := {si : i ∈ I} ,
40
.
= SNR
−minI d∗Nt(I),nr(
∑
i∈I ri).
(4.6)
To establish the converse, we take the random codebook approach similar
to that used by Tse et al. in [11]. Let Si be the codebook of the ith mobile
user, consisting of (ni × T ) code matrices that are randomly generated by
some complex Gaussian random generator. Further, Si satisfies the desired
multiplexing gain,
1
T
log2 |Si| = Ri = ri log2 SNR.
Let E (I) denote the event that the signal matrices of users in I are erro-
neously decoded by the joint decoder. Then arguing similarly as in [11], it
can be shown that
Pr {E (I)} ≤˙ SNR−d∗Nt(I),nr(
∑
i∈I ri)
whenever
T ≥ Nt(I) + nr − 1.
Thus, using union bound we have
Pe (r0, · · · , rK−1) ≤
∑
I
Pr {E (I)}
.
= SNR
−minI d∗Nt(I),nr(
∑
i∈I ri),
provided that
T ≥ max
I
Nt(I) + nr − 1 = N + nr − 1.
This proves Theorem 7.
4.3 MAC-DMT for General MIMO-MAC with
Individual ML Decoding
In the previous section we investigated the MAC-DMT for a general MIMO-
MAC with joint decoding at the receiver end. We also observed in Example 2
42
since if i 6∈ I, the ith user is not in outage. Now let P (i)e (r0, · · · , rK−1) denote
the error probability of the individual decoder for the ith user; then it can
be shown that
P (i)e (r0, · · · , rK−1) ≥ Pr {Oi}
≥˙ max
I⊆{0,1,··· ,K−1}
i∈I
Pr {O(I)}
.
= SNR
−d(i)∗{n0,··· ,nK−1},nr (r0,··· ,rK−1),
where the first inequality follows from [9, Lemma 5]. To show the converse,
let E (I) denote the error event that the signal matrices of the users in I are
erroneously decoded under joint decoding. Then simply note that the error
probability of an individual ML decoder is upper bounded by that of a joint
ML decoder, i.e.,
P (i)e (r0, · · · , rK−1) ≤ Pr

⋃
I⊆{0,1,··· ,K−1}
i∈I
E (I)
 ,
where the right-hand-side gives the probability of a joint ML decoder when
the signal of the ith user is erroneously decoded. Now using the union bound
argument and along similar lines as in the proof of Theorem 7 it can be
shown that
P (i)e (r0, · · · , rK−1) ≤
∑
I⊆{0,1,··· ,K−1}
i∈I
Pr {E (I)}

−d∗
Nt(I),nr(
∑
i∈I ri)
.
= SNR
−d(i)∗{n0,··· ,nK−1},nr (r0,··· ,rK−1).
This completes the proof.
With the above result, we now come back to Example 2 to investigate
the individual MAC-DMT of the second user.
Example 3 (Continued from Example 2). In Example 2 we have considered
the specific case of K = 2, n0 = 1, n1 = 2, nr = 2 and r0 = 0. Assuming the

user who has lesser number of transmit antennas, the DMT performances of
the joint and individual decoders are the same and are actually equal to his
single-user performance d∗1,2(r).
Next we could apply Theorem 8 to the case of symmetric MIMO-MAC
to see how the error probabilities of joint and individual ML decoders com-
pare. The comparison is given in the following corollary. It shows that in
the symmetric MIMO-MAC there is no difference in terms of MAC-DMT
performance between the joint and individual ML decoders.
Corollary 9. For symmetric MIMO-MAC with K users, each having nt
transmit antennas and transmitting at multiplexing gain ri = r, let Pe(r)

simply patching an extra coded block to each user’s code matrices, similar
to that described in Section 3. Henceforth we will drop the subscript “o” in
Ko, Ko, τo, Co, So, etc. for simplicity.
Given ni and K, we first define
nmax := max
0≤i≤K−1
ni (4.9)
as the maximal number of transmit antennas among all users. In general, the
number nmax can be either pre-known to all the users, or explicitly specified
among any groups of users. Next, let L = F(ϑ) be the number field that is
cyclic Galois over F = Q( ı ) with degree nmax, and let K = F(η) be another
cyclic Galois extension of F with degree K. Let σ be the generator of the
Galois group Gal(L/F), and similarly let τ be the generator of Gal(K/F).
The fields L and K are required to satisfy L ∩ K = F or are required such
that τ and σ commute. Finally, we set E = LK to be the compositum of
fields L and K. Similar to Section 3, with some suitable unimodular ζ ∈ F∗,
we have
D = E ⊕ zE ⊕ · · · ⊕ znmax−1E (4.10)
as an appropriate central simple division K-algebra with xz = zσ(x) for
x ∈ E , where z is an indeterminate satisfying znmax = ζ.
Given the multiplexing gain ri of the ith user, we set the corresponding
base alphabet and information set as follows:
Ai(SNR) =
{
a+ b ı :
−SNR ri2nmax ≤ a, b ≤ SNR ri2nmax ,
a, b ∈ Z, a, b odd
}
(4.11)
and
Ai(SNR) =
{
nmax−1∑
j=0
zj
Knmax−1∑
k=0
xj,kek : xj,k ∈ Ai(SNR)
}
, (4.12)
where {e0, · · · , eKnmax−1} is an integral basis of E /F. Unlike the construc-
tion for symmetrical MIMO-MAC, here the information set can be different
among users as each user has different level of multiplexing gain.
Let ψ denote the left-regular map of elements in D into matrices of size
(nmax × nmax) whose entries are in E (similar to ψo of (3.6)); then the ST
code Si of the ith user is given by
Si =
 Si = κi
[
Xi τ (Xi) · · · τK−1 (Xi)
]
:
Xi = ψ(xi), xi ∈ Ai(SNR)
 , (4.13)
48
Proof. The first claim can be easily verified from the settings of κi and
Ai(SNR), and is thus omitted for brevity. For the second, to determine
the rank of S, it suffices to consider the rank of the unscaled code matrix
C =
 X0 · · · τ
K−1 (X0)
...
. . .
...
XK−1 · · · τK−1 (XK−1)
 . (4.18)
Notice that C is a code matrix of the code Co defined in (3.14) for the sym-
metric MIMO-MAC when we set nt = nmax and
r = max
i
ri.
Now the result follows from Property 2.
The next property generalizes Property 3 in Section 3.2 where we were
interested in the Gram determinant of the un-scaled code matrix. Here, for
the purpose of analyzing the general MAC-DMT performance of the proposed
code, we will seek directly the Gram determinant of the overall matrix S.
Property 6. Let C be defined as in (4.16) and assume that {x>i0 , · · · , x>im−1}
is a subset of rows of C that are linearly independent as a left D-module. Let
Ss =
 κi0Xi0 · · · κi0τ

be the submatrix of S consisting of the corresponding mnmax rows. Then[
‖γ‖2mnt · det (SsS†s)] ≥ SNRmnmax−∑m−1j=0 rij . (4.20)
Proof. Arguing similarly to the proof of Property 5, set
Cs =
 Xi0 · · · τ
K−1 (Xi0)
...
. . .
...
Xim−1 · · · τK−1
(

 . (4.21)
50
The proof to Theorem 10 can in fact be further extended to show that
the proposed code S (4.15) achieves the optimal individual MAC-DMT (4.8),
provided that an individual ML decoder for each user is used at the receiver
end. This result along with the proof will be presented in Corollary 12 of
Section 6.1.
52
Specifically, let xi ∈ Ao(SNR) denote the information symbol transmitted by
the ith user, and let xˆi be the corresponding decoding output at receiver;
then the event En (Im) can be formulated as follows:
En (Im) :=

xi 6= xˆ′i, for all i ∈ Im,
xi = xˆ
′
i, for all i 6∈ Im, and
rank (Co − C ′o) = nnt
 , (5.2)
where from the proposed construction So (cf. (3.14)) we have
Co =
 ψo(x0) · · · τ
Ko−1
o (ψo(x0))
...
. . .
...
ψo(xKo−1) · · · τKo−1o (ψo(xKo−1))

and
C ′o =
 ψo(x

0) · · · τKo−1o (ψo(x′0))

...
ψo(x
′
Ko−1) · · · τKo−1o
(
ψo(x

Ko−1)
)
 .
Note that the difference matrix Co − C ′o has exactly mnt nonzero rows, and
by Property 2 we see the rank distance nt ≤ rank(Co−C ′o) ≤ mnt. Hence it
makes sense for the second requirement of error event En (Im) that rank(Co−
C ′o) = nnt for some 1 ≤ n ≤ m.
Thus, it can be seen from the union bound argument that the codeword
error probability is upper bounded by

The event En (Im) is a further partition of the event considered by Tse et al.
in [11]. We discuss this in more detail in the following remark.
Remark 7. With regard to the Gaussian random codebook considered by Tse
et al. [11], it is straightforward to see En (Im) is empty with probability one if
n < m, since the component matrices associated with each user are complex
Gaussian random matrices of size (nt × T ) for some T ≥ Kont. In other
words, if xi 6= xˆ′i for all i ∈ Im and xi = xˆ′i otherwise, then the error matrix
54
The error performance analysis following this outline will be given in
Section 5.3. Finally, in Section 5.6 we briefly discuss the proof for the case
of even K.

We distinguish the following two cases which correspond to the error events
Em (Im) and En (Im) with n < m, respectively.
1. For event Em (Im) we have x` 6= x′` for ` ∈ {i0, · · · , im−1}, x` = x′`
otherwise, and rank(Co − C ′o) = mnt. In this case, let Cs and C ′s be
defined as in (3.23) and let

2. The second case corresponds to event En (Im) which means x` 6= x′`
for ` ∈ Im = {i0, · · · , im−1}, xi = x′i otherwise, and rank (Co − C ′o) =
nnt < mnt. In other words, the m nonzero rows{[
(x` − x′`) · · · τKo−1o (x` − x′`)
]
: ` ∈ Im
}
are not linearly independent over Do. From Property 2 we can assume
without loss of generality that{[
(x` − x′`) · · · τKo−1o (x` − x′`)
]
: ` = i0, · · · , in−1
}
are linearly independent for some n < m.
Let dx` := x`−x′` and let Cs and C ′s be defined as in (3.23) with respect
to the set {i0, · · · , im−1}. Set ∆Cs = Cs − C ′s and ∆X` = ψo(dx`).
Property 2 in turn implies that

Remark 8. We remark that (5.20) shows the last term is − rn
k
, instead of
being − rm
k
as in (5.11). For readers who may wonder why these two terms
are different given both events concern the case of m users in error, the major
reason is due to the distance bounding techniques, i.e., the repeated arithmetic
mean-geometric mean inequalities, we have used in the above.
In general, when the equivalent channel matrix Heq of (5.15), and sim-
ilarly when the channel matrix Hs with n = m, has rank Qn, the rank of
the product matrix Heq∆X would be Qn since ∆X is of full rank nnt. Thus
our lower bound on the norm ‖Heq∆X‖ would only capture the Qn smaller
eigenvalues of ∆X∆X†, which are all nonzero. Furthermore, one reason for
introducing the equivalent channel matrix Heq, rather than working with Hs
is that, algebraically speaking, the norm ‖Hs∆Cs‖ could be zero as ∆Cs is
singular and all the rows of Hs could lie in the left-null space of Cs. However,
since Hs is random, this occurs with probability zero. In other words, if we
apply the series of arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequalities to the matrix
product Hs∆Cs, we could end up with the trivial algebraic inequality
dE(So, S
′
o) ≥ min
Hs
‖Hs∆Cs‖ = 0,
even the right-hand-side has probability 0. Whether the above could happen
depends on the relations among n, m, nt, and nr. While there is nothing
wrong with the algebraic inequality itself, this bound can actually be further
tightened by introducing the equivalent channel Heq so that we can focus on
error events that have probability larger than zero.
Remark 9. Another heuristic way to see why the last term of δ
(m,n)
2,k equals
− rn
k
follows from the base-alphabet A(SNR) defined in Section 3.1. Recall
that in the construction of (nnt × T ) CDA-based ST code for point-to-point
channel [4,6], to achieve the DMT optimality therein we would set the base-
alphabet as
A′(SNR) =
{
a+ b ı :
−SNR r2nnt ≤ a, b ≤ SNR r2nnt ,
a, b ∈ Z, a, b odd
}
60
Then, using the bounded distance decoder discussed in Section 5.1, the prob-
ability of error event Em(Im) given channel matrix H can be upper bounded
by
Pr {Em(Im)|H}
≤ Pr

(5.21)
where the inequality follows from the property of a bounded distance decoder.
Hence we see that Pr {Em(Im)|H} .= 0 if δ(m)1,k (α(m)1 ) > 0. On the other hand,
we may replace the above upper bound of Pr {Em(Im)|H} with the trivial
upper bound Pr {Em(Im)|H} ≤ 1 when δ(m)1,min(α(m)1 ) ≤ 0. Thus, it implies
Pr {Em(Im)} = EH Pr {Em(Im)|H}
≤ Pr
{
H : δ

}
≤ Pr
{
H : δ

}
.
Similarly, for error event En(Im) with n < m we have
Pr {En(Im)} = EH Pr {En(Im)|H}
≤ Pr
{
H : δ

.
Since the above bounds do not depend on the specific choices of Im, from

whereQm := min{mnt, nr}, Hs =

, and where (x)+ = max{x, 0}
for x ∈ R. Equation (5.26) follows from [31–33], and (5.27) is given in [9]
since Hs is a matrix of size (nr×mnt) having entries that are i.i.d. CN (0, 1)
complex Gaussian random variables. The quantity d∗mnt,nr(rm) represents
the point-to-point DMT of an mnt × nr MIMO Rayleigh fading channel at
multiplexing gain rm.

1 ≤ n < m ≤ Ko that

{

) ≤ rn log SNR} ,
(5.28)
where Heq is defined in (5.15) and is of size (nr×nnt). Noting that the entries
of Heq are correlated complex Gaussian random variables, we invoke the
64
for 1 ≤ n < m. This is exactly what is shown in Theorem 2. Furthermore, in
the event Em of m users in error, the proposed code So has error probability
Pr {Em} ≤

5.6 Proof Outline for K Even
The proof of Theorem 6 can be adapted to cater to the case when the number
of users K is even. Here we discuss only briefly what the changes are. Firstly,
with
H =
[
H0 · · · HK−1 0
]
in mind, i.e., HKo−1 = 0, the result (5.5) of the squared Euclidean distance
between So and S
′
o remains to hold. Similarly, the further lower bounds on
d2E(So, S
′
o) in (5.11) and (5.20) stay without changes except that one should
keep the following in mind.
1. The parameter m of the first case, where rank(Co−C ′o) = mnt, and m
out of Ko xi’s are distinct, has value from 1 up to Ko− 1 = K. This is
because HKo−1 = 0, and we can always assume xKo−1 = x
′
Ko−1 without
affecting the value of d2E(So, S
′
o). Thus the diversity gain resulting from
the first case is
min
1≤m≤K
d∗mnt,nr (mr) .
Compared with the case of odd K, (5.27) has m up to Ko.
2. The parameters m and n in the second case can be argued similarly as
the above, and we have 1 ≤ n < m ≤ Ko− 1 = K. Hence the diversity
gain of this case is
min
1≤n≤K−1
d∗nnt,nr (nr) .
Overall, it shows the MAC-DMT optimality of the proposed construction
remains to hold.
66
and the received signal matrix Y can be written as
Y =
K−1∑
i=0
H˜iSi +W,
where W is the noise matrix of size (nr ×Knmax).
For the event Em(Im), let
H˜s =
[
H˜i0 · · · H˜im−1
]
be the overall equivalent channel matrix, and let λ
(m)
1,1 ≤ · · · ≤ λ(m)1,QIm be the
ordered nonzero eigenvalues of H˜sH˜
†
s with
Q
(m)
Im = min
{
nr,
m−1∑

}
.
Similarly, let `1,1 ≥ · · · ≥ `1,mnmax > 0 be the ordered nonzero eigenvalues of
(Ss − S ′s) (Ss − S ′s)†. Then the minimum squared Euclidean distance between
Ss and S
′
s is bounded by

Proof. Following the proof outline of Theorem 8 it suffices to show only that
the error probability of the ith individual decoder of the proposed code S
meets the following bound
P (i)e (r0, · · · , rK−1) ≤˙ SNR−d
(i)∗
{n0,··· ,nK−1},nr
(r0,··· ,rK−1).
Again, note that the error probability of ith individual decoder can be upper
bounded by the joint decoder when the error events Em(Im) and En(Im),
1 ≤ n ≤ m, occur with i ∈ Im. It then follows from (6.5) and (6.6) that
P (i)e (r0, · · · , rK−1)

This completes the proof.
6.2 Proof of Theorem 3
Consider the multi-user set up with K users, each having nt transmit an-
tennas. The users are simultaneously and synchronously transmitting the
matrix Ck, k = 0, 1, · · · , K−1, and each is using a (user specific) code lattice
Lk, k = 0, 1, · · · , K − 1 of complex nt ×Knt-matrices, so Ck ∈ Lk for all k.
From the receiver’s point of view, the overall Knt ×Knt code matrix
C = M(C0, C1, · · · , CK−1) =

C0
C1
...
CK−1

then becomes interesting. Theorem 2 lists the following requirements that
the group of lattices Lk should ideally have.
1. Each lattice Lk should have the full rank 2Kn
2
t in order to reach the
maximum multiplexing gain. That is, assuming a PAM alphabet of
size SNR
r
2nt , the code Ck defined by Lk has size[
SNR
r
2nt
]2Kn2t
= SNRrKnt ,
70
Lemma 13. The mapping f : Q→ C, given by
X + L(∆C1, · · · ,∆CK−1) 7→ det(M(X,∆C1, · · · ,∆CK−1) (6.7)
is well-defined and continuous.
Proof. Any two (nt × Knt) matrices X and X ′ determine the same coset
modulo V , if and only if the difference matrix X − X ′ is a complex linear
combination of the matrices ∆C1,∆C2, · · · ,∆CK−1. It is immediately clear
that in that case
det(M(X,∆C1, · · · ,∆CK−1)
= det(M(X ′,∆C1, · · · ,∆CK−1).
Therefore f is a well-defined function. Continuity of f follows from the
continuity of the polynomial function X 7→ det(M(X,∆C1, · · · ,∆CK−1) and
the basic properties of the quotient topology.
Lemma 14. A subgroup in Cn is a lattice if and only if it is discrete.
Having obtained Lemmas 13 and 14, we are now in position to prove
Theorem 3.
Proof. As above, let us fix non-zero difference matrices ∆Ck ∈ Lk, k =
1, 2, · · · , K − 1 for all the other users. Let ∆C0 ∈ L0 be non-zero. Let
pi : W → Q denote the natural projection.
By the second requirement we have
det(M(∆C0, · · · ,∆CK−1)) 6= 0,
so ∆C0 does not belong to the subspace V . Therefore ∆C0 + V 6= 0Q, and
we see that kerpi intersects trivially with the lattice of the first user L0. So
restricted to the free abelian group L0, pi is an injection. Hence G = pi(L0)
is a free abelian group of rank 2Kn2t ⊂ Q.
Because dimCQ < Kn
2
t , the quotient space Q is not big enough to contain
a free abelian group of rank 2Kn2t as a discrete subset. Therefore the set G
must have an accumulation point in Q by Lemma 14. In other words, there
are matrices in G that are arbitrarily close to each other. As G is closed

The ISIT is like always the largest symposium in the field of information theory. It has been 
held more almost half century. Researchers from all over the world have come to attend this 
symposium and to make new friends while getting together with their old friends. During the 
last decade, I miss only twice. My finding of this symposium is that not so many people from 
Taiwan would attend it. Prof Chao is a frequent attendee and he attends almost every ISIT. 
Others are not as enthusiastic as Prof Chao. I would suggest to researchers in the IT field in 
Taiwan to come more often to this symposium and get to make more friends from other 
countries who may have the same research interest as you.
