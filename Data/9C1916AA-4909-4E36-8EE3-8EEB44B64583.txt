ABSTRACT 
It is essential to characterize the uncertainties of soil shear strengths, including friction angles of sands. 
In particular, it is of practical interest to reduce the uncertainties in friction angles based on all available 
information by correlation, given the considerable cost of a typical site investigation. This study proposes a 
systematic way of constructing multivariate correlations on friction angles of clean sands. A set of simplified 
equations are obtained through Bayesian analysis for the purpose of reducing uncertainties. The inputs to the 
equations are the results of field and laboratory tests, and the outputs are the updated mean values and 
standard deviations of the friction angles. Test databases are used to demonstrate the consistency of the 
proposed simplified equations.

For Bayesian analysis, the statistics (e.g. mean and standard deviation) of the following quantities are 
needed: (a) d conditioning on {Dr, p’}; (b) cv; (c) qc1 conditioning on p; (d) (N1)60 conditioning on p. The 
derivations of the statistics are presented in detail below. 
First two moments of d conditioning on {Dr, p} 
The correlation between d of sands and {Dr, p} is well known, e.g. Bolton (1986). Data points have 
been compiled from the references listed in Table 1 to estimate this correlation. These data points are mostly 
from triaxial tests on NC quartz sands. Their D50 ranges from 0.20 mm to 0.67 mm and their Cu ranges from 
1.56 to 5.92. Figure 1 2 compiles the data points for this correlation, where the solid lines show the prediction 
of the Bolton’s model at various Dr: 
 
    | , 3 3 lnd r R rE D p I D Q p R          (1) 
  
where IR is the dilatancy index; Q and R are model parameters, chosen to be 11.5 and 0.8 in this study, 
respectively, to obtain a good fit to the data points (Bolton (1986) originally chose Q = 10 and R = 1); rD  is 
expressed as a fraction (not percentage) while the mean confining pressure at failure p is in the unit of kN/m2. 
The mean confining pressure at failure p is indeed uncertain but is considered to be much less uncertain than 
the transformation uncertainty for the dilation angle d. First of all, p can be reasonably estimated as 2 times 
the in-situ vertical effective stress (Kulhawy and Mayne (1990). From the formula d = 3{Dr[Q-ln(p)]-R}, one 
can see that a 20% over/underestimation of p for a sand with Dr = 60% only results in an error of 3Drln(1.2) 
= 0.32o in d. This error is considerably smaller than the 1.96o standard deviation for the transformation 
uncertainty. Therefore, p is considered as deterministic in subsequent Bayesian updating analyses. Table 1 lists 
the recommended values for Q and R for different types of sands. The choice Q = 11.5 and R = 0.8 is 
reasonably close to the values recommended by the literature. The deviations of the data points from Eq. 
 (1) can be used to estimate the transformation uncertainty of this correlation. The standard deviation of 
this transformation uncertainty is on average 1.96 degrees.

First two moments of  1 60N  conditioning on p  
Data points have been compiled from the references listed in Table 2 to estimate the correlation between 
friction angle and SPT-N value. These data points were based on SPT conducted in calibration chambers 
containing clean quartz sands. Some sands were mixed with 25% gravels. Their D50 ranges from 0.34 mm to 
1.13 mm, and Cu ranges from 1.95 to 5.65. Notice that these data points belong to only two types of sands. 
The mean function for ln[(N1)60] conditioning on n is estimated to be 
 
  1 60ln | 0.161 3.724p pE N        (3) 
 
The p  in Eq.  (3) is the secant effective friction angle under the triaxial compression condition at 
the stress level corresponding to the same initial stress state of the chamber test. The standard deviation for the 
above transformation is about 0.248, which is unrealistically low judging from the large measurement 
uncertainty of SPT-N tests. This may be due to the fact that only two types of sands are used to obtain this 
correlation and the high degree of control exercised in calibration chamber tests. 
According to the data points compiled by Chen (2004) for the ln[(N1)60] vs. n correlation on undisturbed 
natural sands of wider variety, the transformation uncertainty of this relation is roughly two times larger. 
Assuming the magnitudes of transformation uncertainties for undisturbed natural sands and reconstituted 
clean sands are comparable, the standard deviation for the correlation in Eq. (3) is doubled to 0.496. Figure 2 
shows the mean value (bold solid line) and 95% confidence interval (bold dotted lines) of this correlation and 
the comparison with the actual data points of reconstituted clean sands. It is interesting to compare this 
correlation with existing ones. Although several correlations have been proposed between friction angle and 
SPT-N value in the literature (e.g., Kulhawy and Mayne 1990), some early correlations were developed using 
the uncorrected N value. They cannot be compared with Figure 4 in a consistent way. Two recent correlations 
(Mayne 2001; Chen 2004) are available for comparison - both are results derived from studies on undisturbed 
natural sands or gravels. These two correlations are plotted using thin lines in Figure 2. Mayne (2001) 
correlation is largely based on Hatanaka and Uchida (1996) study of tests on undisturbed natural sands, while 
Chen (2004) correlation is derived from a database of 70 cohesionless soils ranging from silty sands to sandy 
gravels. In Mayne (2001), nonlinearity of the failure envelop was not considered, hence direct comparison to 
the proposed reconstituted clean sand correlation may not be proper. The original undisturbed natural sand 
and gravel data from Chen (2004) are also plotted in the figure. Although there is certain discrepancy (bias)

4 BAYESIAN INFERENCE WITH MULTIVARIATE TEST DATA 
Bayesian analysis is a natural way of handling multivariate information. If the variable of interest and the 
observed variable are jointly Gaussian, it is possible to derive all relevant conditional means and conditional 
standard deviations in closed-form. The updated mean and standard deviation (in degrees) of the friction angle 
conditioning on various combination of multivariate test data can be summarized as follows (note: IR =

Test scenario B: reducing uncertainties by using {Dr, p} and CPT 
Figure 5 shows the prediction results for reconstituted clean sands for scenarios B1 (prediciting p based 
on qc1 only). The predictions are in general satisfactory. Note that the range between the two dashed lines is 
rather wide due to the large uncertainty in Eq. (7). Figure 6 shows the prediction results for reconstituted clean 
sands for scenarios B2 (prediciting p based on {Dr, p} and qc1). First, note that the range between the two 
dashed lines is significantly reduced after the inclusion of the {Dr, p} information. Despite the reduction of 
this range, most sands still lie within the narrow range, except the Erksak sand (ErS).

6 CONCLUSIONS 
The main product of this study is a set of equations whose inputs are the observed multivariate test index 
values and outputs are the updated mean values and standard deviation of the friction angle. Due to the limited 
variety of sands in the pairwise correlations, these equations are strictly applicable to normally consolidated 
clean quartz sands. Test scenarios are presented to verify the consistency of the proposed framework for 
estimating friction angles of reconstituted clean sands. The results show that the proposed framework can 
provide consistent prediction for the friction angle over reconstituted clean sands and can reduce the standard 
deviation of friction angle by incorporating more sources of information.

一、參加會議經過 
The GEORISK 2011 was held from 26th to 28th June 2011 in Atlanta, Georgia.  The conference is 
organized by the Geo-Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).  Topics and issues 
relating to uncertainty, reliability, risk assessment and management in geoengineering has been a focus of 
research and development over the past decade.  This conference is the first event specialized in georisk 
organized by the ASCE, and experts in related field from the world have come together to exchange their 
ideas and research results. There are more than 120 technical presentations, four expert panel discussions, 
three pre-conference short courses, and eight plenary keynote lectures all focusing on subjects including 
characterization and modeling of soils and uncertainty modeling; earthquake engineering; engineering 
geology and site characterization; LRFD for foundation systems; and retaining structures. Because this 
specialized conference is in line with one of my main research focus, most presentations in the conference 
are of interest to me. Owing to the limit of time, technical and/or panel discussion sessions could only be 
arranged in parallel. In some time slots for technical sessions, multiple presentations interested me are in 
progress at about the same time. It is slightly a pity that I could choose to go for one of them.   
In this conference, I presented one paper entitled “Updating Uncertainties in Friction Angles of Clean 
Sands”, which is scheduled in a technical session discussing “Uncertainty Analysis”. This paper 
summarizes some of the research results of this sponsored NSC project. Characterization of uncertainty is 
one of the important elements that have to be addressed in geotechnical reliability and risk analysis. In 
general, there are many sources of geotechnical uncertainty, while this paper focuses on the uncertainty of 
soil strength parameters. A framework for updating the uncertainty of estimated soil friction angle is 
proposed and results with easy to use equations are obtained. The presentation drew some discussions

ABSTRACT 
 
It is essential to characterize the uncertainties of soil shear strengths, including 
friction angles of sands. In particular, it is of practical interest to reduce the 
uncertainties in friction angles based on all available information by correlation, 
given the considerable cost of a typical site investigation. This study proposes a 
systematic way of constructing multivariate correlations on friction angles of clean 
sands. A set of simplified equations are obtained through Bayesian analysis for the 
purpose of reducing uncertainties. The inputs to the equations are the results of field 
and laboratory tests, and the outputs are the updated mean values and standard 
deviations of the friction angles. Test databases are used to demonstrate the 
consistency of the proposed simplified equations. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Uncertainties in soil properties are commonly encountered in geotechnical 
engineering. More economical geotechnical designs can be achieved by updating 
uncertainties through site investigation. Reliability-based design (RBD) is known to 
provide a rational basis for propagating uncertainties in the design environment 
explicitly into the final design outcome (e.g. width of footing). However, one 
recurring criticism of RBD is that there is no particular motivation to use it because it 
seems to produce designs comparable to existing practice. One of the key objectives 
of this paper is to demonstrate that site investigation is not a cost item but an 
investment item, because updating of uncertainties through more and/or better tests 
can translate directly to design savings through RBD. 
This paper focuses on the peak friction angle cohesionless soils. In practice, it 
is already well-known that field or laboratory test data, denoted as “test indices” from 
here on, can be used to estimate friction angles through correlations. In the literature, 
such pairwise correlations between various test indices and friction angles have been 
widely studied. A fairly comprehensive review of pairwise correlations between 
various test indices and friction angles is given in Kulhawy and Mayne (1990). 
In reality, site investigation usually produces multivariate information. For 
instance, when borehole samples are drawn, SPT-N values are usually available, and 
the information regarding density and gradation can also be obtained through 
laboratory tests. Many of these test indices may be simultaneously correlated to 
friction angles if they are taken within distances where the spatial correlation is strong. 
 aging effects, etc. For Bayesian analysis, the statistics (e.g. mean and standard 
deviation) of the following quantities are needed: (a) φd conditioning on {Dr, p’}; (b) φcv; (c) qc1 conditioning on φp; (d) (N1)60 conditioning on φp.

The most effective information is {Dr, p’} since the corresponding standard 
deviation is the smallest. It is also clear that the standard deviation decreases with 
increasing amount of information. 
 
VALIDATION OF BAYESIAN EQUATIONS 
 
Test database with data points of sands and gravels of known {Dr, p’}, (N1)60, 
qc1 and φp are compiled and studied to assess the performance for the Bayesian 
 standard deviation of the friction angle. Due to the limited variety of sands in the 
pairwise correlations, these equations are strictly applicable to normally consolidated 
clean quartz sands. Several test databases are presented to verify the consistency of 
the proposed framework for estimating friction angles of reconstituted clean sands. 
The results show that the proposed framework can provide consistent prediction for 
the friction angle over reconstituted clean sands and can reduce the standard deviation 
of friction angle by incorporating more sources of information.
