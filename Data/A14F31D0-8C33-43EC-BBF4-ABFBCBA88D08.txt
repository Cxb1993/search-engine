1中文摘要
本計畫主要探討封裝材料(Liquid compound)之固化程度與壓力、體積及溫度之間的關
係。封裝材料(Liquid compound)是一種熱固性材料(Thermosetting)，在烘烤製程中會產生交聯
(Crosslinking)反應，或稱熟化反應(Cure reaction)，分子結構轉為較緊密且強勁。在過去封裝
過程中，只考慮不同材料間的熱膨脹係數(Coefficient of Thermal Expansion, CTE)所造成的體
積收縮，而卻忽略了封裝材料(Liquid compound)固化反應過程中所產生的體積收縮，因此無
法準確的估計出封裝產品翹曲量。故本計劃嘗試建立出一個 P-V-T-C 關係式(壓力、體積收縮、
溫度、熟化度)，並以數學方式呈現。此關係式可同時考慮不同材料間熱膨脹係數及固化反應
所造的體積收縮。藉此關係式可求得恆溫恆壓下的熟化度與體積收縮率之間的關係，並將關
係式運用在分析軟體上，而準確的預測出不同製程下產品所產生的內應力分佈與翹曲量。
建立此關係式方法包括三個流程。首先，利用微差掃描熱卡計(DSC)配合統計之技巧來
求封裝材料之反應動力學模式。第二，量測封裝材料於等溫等壓下的體積變化。第三，整合
體積變化與等溫熟化度的資料，並且建立出 P-V-T-C 關係式。
關鍵字：翹曲、封裝材料、熟化反應、P-V-T-C 關係式
Abstract
In this study, the relationship between conversion, pressure, volume shrinkage and temperature of
Liquid compound was mainly investigated. Liquid compound which is one of thermosetting
material would produce crosslinking during the heating. The crosslinking is called of cure reaction
which causes distance of molecule to be close, and structure would be hard after heating. In the past,
the volume shrinkage which was caused by different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE)
values of constitutive materials have only been considered in warpage simulation. Recently, there
are more evidences showing that it is not accurately predict the amount of warpage without
considering cure-induced volume shrinkage in a package. However, in this study, the behavior of
volume shrinkage was described by a pressure-volume-temperature-cure (P-V-T-C) equation with
mathematical model. The P-V-T-C equation could be applied for analytical software to accurately
calculate the amount of warpage and the residual stress in a package. Three procedures were
conducted for the P-V-T-C equation. First, the reaction kinetics of Liquid compound was
determined by employing DSC and a statistical technique. Second, the volume shrinkage of Liquid
compound was measured under isobaric and isothermal states. Third, the P-V-T-C equation was
established by combining the data of volume shrinkage and conversion.
Keywords: Warpage, Liquid compound, Cure-induced shrinkage,
Pressure-volume-temperature-cure (P-V-T-C) equation.
2測過程為等溫等壓，建立出 EMC 熟化反應中體積收縮的數學關係式[9][10]。Hong 和 Hwang
應用此數學關係式於 IC封裝模擬分析，預測封裝結構的翹曲及殘留應力[11]。而Teng與Hwang
同時考慮 IC 產品之熱收縮與熟化收縮的效應，將之合併後以有限元素法預測產品最後之翹曲
量，同時也可大致的預測過程中產生之包風與金線偏移現象[12]。
研究方法:
一、建立 P-V-T-C 流程
(1) 使用 DSC(Differential Scanning Calorimeter)量測底膠材料之放熱量隨時間的變化，進而
推得材料的熟化曲線，選用 Kamal 和 Sourour 所提出的 n 次級數與自催化結合反應模式，
利用統計軟體求得此反應動力學模式的各項參數，而建立出液態封裝材料之熟化反應動
力學模式。
(2) 使用 P-V-T-C 測試機量測液態封裝材料於等溫等壓條件下隨著時間之熟化體積收縮量。
(3) 將兩實驗結果整合，建立出在各溫度及壓力下之熟化度與體積收縮量的關係曲線方程
式，並且統計軟體求出式中的各項參數。
(4) 推測預熱時間前之體積收縮量，並且設為一項溫度與壓力的函數，與原方程式結合，成
為液態封裝材料之 P-V-T-C 關係式，藉此推測封裝材料在各種製程溫度下的收縮情形。
二、反應動力學模式
定義熟化反應程度正比於熟化反應的熱量變化，即量測到的放熱速率正比於熟化反應速率
[8]。

DSC(Differential Scanning Calorimeter)稱為微差掃描熱卡計，可以掌握材料隨著時間產生
的熱量變化，故可以用來量測材料的熟化度資訊，在本研究中選用 DSC-7 來量測底膠材料的
熱量變化，實驗中分別以每分鐘 10, 20, 40°C三種升溫速率由 25°C升溫至 250°C。
液態封裝材料(liquid compound)在受熱過程中會產生交聯反應，通常稱為固化反應(cure
reaction)，在這種反應也會伴隨著放熱的情形，進而提高了材料的溫度、也會加速反應速率，
而實驗中選用兩種液態封裝材料(liquid compound)，分別 SMC800 和 XS87455-111。
本研究採用Kamal和 Sourour[13] [14]所提出的 n次級數與自催化結合反應模式(combined
kinetic model)來描述液態封裝材料(liquid compound)的熟化反應行為，如下式所示。

三、體積收縮率量測
實驗的方法是利用柱塞壓縮模穴內的熱固性封裝材料 EMC(Epoxy Molding Compound,
EMC)，並紀錄柱塞於圓柱內高度變化，利用材料柱塞隨時間的高度變化即可推求材料隨著時
間的體積變化[9]，如下圖(3)所示。
此實驗採取了三種溫度及壓力來進行，SMC800 溫度分別設定為 120 °C、130 °C與
140°C，而壓力方面則設定了 1.8 kgf/cm2、2.4 kgf/cm2 以及 3.0 kgf/cm2，而 XS87455-11 溫度
分別設定為 130°C、140°C與 150°C，而壓力方面則設定了 2.5 kgf/cm2、3.0 kgf/cm2 以及 3.5
kgf/cm2 當材料置入模穴後需等待一段預熱時間，已達到一定程度之熟化度以防止溢料的情形
發生，之後才開始加壓進行實驗，而預熱時間的長短則取決於經由 DSC 實驗而求得的各溫度
之熟化度歷時曲線，故每種溫度下進行的實驗所需的預熱時間也會不同，當實驗開始時，材
料會因受壓而開始有體積收縮的現象，而體積變化量的計算方式則如下所示。

由體積收縮率與熟化度之關係圖中可以觀察出實驗前段也近似於線性關係，故本研究中
假設其為線性關係並嘗試藉此推測預熱時間前之體積收縮率，分別採用熟化度為 0.05 及 0.15
時之資訊，以外插法預估熟化度由 0 至 0.05 區間內之體積收縮率，且將之視為一平移量，經
過平移後整體之體積收縮率與熟化度關係作推測，本研究中嘗試將每一組實驗所建立之平移
量表示為一項由壓力及溫度組成之函數 G1 (P,T)，並且將此函數與原方程式結合成為液態封裝
材料 P-V-T-C 關係式，函數 G1 (P,T)如下式(17)、(18)、(20)和(21)所示，經過結合後的 P-V-T-C

結論：
一、本計劃中利用 DSC 儀器及統計之技巧成功的建立了之反應動力學模式，藉以充分掌握液
態封裝材料的熟化度資訊。
二、由反應動力學模式推出的熟化度模型中可以觀察出，液態封裝材料位於高溫下會產生較
快的反應速率。
三、由於液態封裝材料在常溫下為液態且流動性佳，若是直接加壓進行體積收縮率的量測，
則會產生溢料的問題，故在本計劃之研究過程中，針對體積收縮率的量測方面採取了延
長預熱時間的作法，以避免溢料的情形發生。
四、在體積收縮率的量測結果中可知，製程溫度明顯的影響了液態封裝材料的收縮行為，溫
度的差異不僅會造成體積收縮率總量的不同，也會使得體積收縮的趨勢有明顯的改變。
五、製程溫度越高，體積收縮率的總量會越小，而體積收縮的趨勢上則會有明顯的轉折；反

ABSTRACT
Through silicon via (TSV) is a technology, which
allows the devices to be connected three-dimensionally.
Three dimensional vertical integration using TSV Cu
interconnect can greatly increase the packaging density
and thus is one of the most advanced and promising
technologies for future IC packaging. However, Cu
filling of void free through silicon via with high aspect
ratio (AR≥10) has been a challenge for researchers for a
long time. In this paper, successful fabrication of void
free TSV with very high aspect ratio was demonstrated
via electroplating process. This paper showed that void
free high aspect ratio TSV could be formed if proper
equipment and processing conditions for electroplating
can be well taken care. This paper also demonstrated
that same equipment and similar chemicals and process
conditions could also be applied to fabricate high quality
redistribution line technology (RDL).

INTRODUCTION
Microelectronics packaging is driven by
the continuous increase in demands for smaller,
faster, and cheaper products with enhanced
performances. Flip-chip technology and
multichip packaging were developed to meet
the market needs. In recent years, the concept
of multichip packaging was evolved into
system-in-a-package (SIP) [1]. The three
dimensional (3-D) packaging can be broadly
classified as chip stacking and package
stacking. In chip stacking technology, dices
are stacked. This technology has the advantages
of increasing die combination and flexibility.
The packaging density can also be increased
greatly. Disadvantages are loop snaps and
testability. In package stacking, packages are
stacked one over the other to overcome the chip

a difficult job. Thus, a carrier wafer was used
to handle the thin wafer. The wafer bonding
layer must bond the wafer face down to the
carrier wafer by Cu to Cu bonding during the
wafer back side thinning process.
The main procedures for via formation were:
(see Figure 1(b))
1. Via etching in the silicon, using deep
reactive ion etch (DRIE) or laser drilling
technology.
2. Insulator deposition (SiN or SiO2), using
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD)
3. Wafer bonding with carrier wafer Ti/ Cu to
Cu
4. Wafer thinning
5. Via filling
6. Metal removal

Cu redistribution (RDL) technology is a well
known process in wafer level package for wafer
integration. The Cu redistribution is one type
of rerouting for current paths. The
redistribution is a complicated process. The
uniformity and line thickness is restricting for
this process. In this RDL investigation, the
same chemical bath conditions as those of TSV
were used. This is another challenger.
Generally speaking, these two processes have
different characteristics. The TSV emphasizes
Cu filling and Cu redistribution emphasizes on
uniformity in thickness. The Redistribution
layer process flow is as shown as figure 4.

The TSV feature was cylindrical shape

Before plating process, high pressure DIW was
used to rinse and clean wafer. This was a
pretreatment process before electro-plating.
The purpose is to increase wafer wetting
capability and remove particles. Skip this
process or poor pretreatment was applied, poor
results might occur. Fountain type flow to
plate the TSV wafers was utilized in this
research. The flow rate was within 4.5 to 5.5
GPM. The working temperature of the
chemical bath was 25 to 30oC. The wafer was
rotated 20 to 50 times per minute (rpm).
Direct current (DC) was used for the power
supply. The Cu plating chemical’s condition 
was listed as below. Cu ion concentration was
50g/L to 90g/L. Sulfuric acid was 80 to 120
ml/L. Chloric ion was 70 to 100ppm. The
concentration of organic additives and current
density of the process were also investigated.

SUMMARY and DISCUSION
The success criteria for deep via
electrodeposition were void free filling. In
high aspect ratio (AR=10:1) through silicon via
to fill Cu by electrodeposition was difficult.
The Cu chemical bath condition, deposition
rate, waveform, wafer pretreatment process and
chemical flow/agitation…etc would influence
the plating results. Thus, proper selection of
equipment, chemicals and suitable process
conditions were the keys to the success of Cu
filling of high aspect ratio TSVs.
This paper has successfully demonstrated the
possibility and feasibility to Cu filling void free
vias with high aspect ratio AR 10:1 if proper
equipment and processing conditions for
electroplating could be well taken care. This
paper also successfully demonstrated that the
same equipment and similar chemicals and
process conditions could also be applied to
fabricate high quality Cu redistribution (RDL)
technology. The results were consistent and
could be repeated many times.
It was found that different TSV process flow
would show different type of defects. For via
first process, the type of defects was void in the
middle of via as shown in Figure 13. The defect
found in the via-last process was void at the
bottom of the vias as shown in Figure 14.

Three dimensional vertical integration using TSV Cu
interconnect can greatly increase the packaging density
and thus is one of the most advanced and promising
technologies for future IC packaging. However, Cu
filling of void free through silicon via with high aspect
ratio (AR≥10) has been a challenge for researchers for a
long time. In this paper, successful fabrication of void
free TSV with very high aspect ratio was demonstrated
via electroplating process. This paper showed that void
free high aspect ratio TSV could be formed if proper
equipment and processing conditions for electroplating
can be well taken care. This paper also demonstrated
that same equipment and similar chemicals and process
conditions could also be applied to fabricate high quality
redistribution line technology (RDL).

INTRODUCTION
Microelectronics packaging is driven by
the continuous increase in demands for smaller,
faster, and cheaper products with enhanced
performances. Flip-chip technology and
multichip packaging were developed to meet
the market needs. In recent years, the concept
of multichip packaging was evolved into
system-in-a-package (SIP) [1]. The three
dimensional (3-D) packaging can be broadly
classified as chip stacking and package
stacking. In chip stacking technology, dices
are stacked. This technology has the advantages
of increasing die combination and flexibility.
The packaging density can also be increased
greatly. Disadvantages are loop snaps and
testability. In package stacking, packages are
stacked one over the other to overcome the chip

a difficult job. Thus, a carrier wafer was used
to handle the thin wafer. The wafer bonding
layer must bond the wafer face down to the
carrier wafer by Cu to Cu bonding during the
wafer back side thinning process.
The main procedures for via formation were:
(see Figure 1(b))
1. Via etching in the silicon, using deep
reactive ion etch (DRIE) or laser drilling
technology.
2. Insulator deposition (SiN or SiO2), using
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD)
3. Wafer bonding with carrier wafer Ti/ Cu to
Cu
4. Wafer thinning
5. Via filling
6. Metal removal

Cu redistribution (RDL) technology is a well
known process in wafer level package for wafer
integration. The Cu redistribution is one type
of rerouting for current paths. The
redistribution is a complicated process. The
uniformity and line thickness is restricting for
this process. In this RDL investigation, the
same chemical bath conditions as those of TSV
were used. This is another challenger.
Generally speaking, these two processes have
different characteristics. The TSV emphasizes
Cu filling and Cu redistribution emphasizes on
uniformity in thickness. The Redistribution
layer process flow is as shown as figure 4.

The TSV feature was cylindrical shape
with 10μm in diameter and 100μm in depth.
Before plating process, high pressure DIW was
used to rinse and clean wafer. This was a
pretreatment process before electro-plating.
The purpose is to increase wafer wetting
capability and remove particles. Skip this
process or poor pretreatment was applied, poor
results might occur. Fountain type flow to
plate the TSV wafers was utilized in this
research. The flow rate was within 4.5 to 5.5
GPM. The working temperature of the
chemical bath was 25 to 30oC. The wafer was
rotated 20 to 50 times per minute (rpm).
Direct current (DC) was used for the power
supply. The Cu plating chemical’s condition 
was listed as below. Cu ion concentration was
50g/L to 90g/L. Sulfuric acid was 80 to 120
ml/L. Chloric ion was 70 to 100ppm. The
concentration of organic additives and current
density of the process were also investigated.

SUMMARY and DISCUSION
The success criteria for deep via
electrodeposition were void free filling. In
high aspect ratio (AR=10:1) through silicon via
to fill Cu by electrodeposition was difficult.
The Cu chemical bath condition, deposition
rate, waveform, wafer pretreatment process and
chemical flow/agitation…etc would influence
the plating results. Thus, proper selection of
equipment, chemicals and suitable process
conditions were the keys to the success of Cu
filling of high aspect ratio TSVs.
This paper has successfully demonstrated the
possibility and feasibility to Cu filling void free
vias with high aspect ratio AR 10:1 if proper
equipment and processing conditions for
electroplating could be well taken care. This
paper also successfully demonstrated that the
same equipment and similar chemicals and
process conditions could also be applied to
fabricate high quality Cu redistribution (RDL)
technology. The results were consistent and
could be repeated many times.
It was found that different TSV process flow
would show different type of defects. For via
first process, the type of defects was void in the
middle of via as shown in Figure 13. The defect
found in the via-last process was void at the
bottom of the vias as shown in Figure 14.
