and Rehabilitation Engineering. Furthermore, we 
presented a conference paper at the 2012 IEEE 
International Conference on Circuits and Systems 
(ISCAS) in Seoul, South Korea. Moreover, the research 
part of this project is an essential part of two 
student’s Master thesis in the Department of 
Electrical Engineering. Additional training was 
provided to undergraduate research students as part 
of this project. Also, technology transfer of the 
underlying design concept of the DD converter with CM 
output was completed. The patenting rights were 
successfully transferred to ITRI, Taiwan.

Also filter resistors Ra are assumed to have a relative mismatch modeled by β. In the signal 
passband Z is small compared to the electrode and interface resistance and is thus neglected in 
the following analysis. The amplifier is assumed to be ideal, i.e. providing infinite CMRR and 
defined differential gain A. Firstly, considering a single-differential amplifier (SA) having an 
input voltage Vc (amplifier shown dashed in Fig. 1) its output voltage is VOSD = A
.
Vc. Circuit 
analysis then yields for VOSD: 
     (1) 
The equation shows that CM interference VCM appears at the amplifier output when there is a 
mismatch between the components. The effective overall CMRR of the system is thus degraded, 
which can lead to strong power line interference in the output signal. 
 
DD recording is known to improve the selectivity of ENG and EMG recordings [11]–[13]. 
Here, we consider the general usefulness of DD for the rejection of power-line interference and 
CM artifacts. The DD structure realizes the function of the differential amplifier in Fig. 1 by 
splitting the input stage into two first rank amplifiers with gain A1=A(1+ΔA) and A2=A(1-ΔA) 
respectively and providing a summing stage to produce the output signal VODD. The circuit 
shown in Fig. 1 yields output voltage VODD:

Fig. 1: Single-amplifier recording configuration (dashed amplifier with output 
VOSD) connected to DM and CM signal sources. AC-coupling filters consist of Ra 
and Z, electrode and tissue resistance is R. Components have relative mismatch α 
and β respectively. The DD configuration uses two ranks of amplifiers shown 
within the dashed area, providing output VODD. 
 
III. Measured Results for the front-end ASIC/PCB implementation 
The required variable gain circuit is implemented in TSMC 0.35 μm CMOS technology. The 
circuit was laid-out occupying an active die area of less than 0.017 mm
2
. The measured current 
consumption of the variable-gain amplifier block remained below 800 nA resulting in less than 
2.5 μW power consumption using ±1.5 V dual supply voltage. The circuit detail is reported in 
our publication [14]. 
The CMRR of the bare amplifier is larger than 97 dB. The linear output voltage range 
measured with a DC sweep and using ±0.9 V supplies is approximately -0.85 V to + 0.75 V. The 
DD recording structure of Fig. 1 is implemented using two ICs, each containing one amplifier 
circuit and buffer output stage. The output load resistance is made small (100 kΩ) compared to 
the load of the oscilloscope probe and ADC so that the desired buffer function is maintained. 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. (top): Measured CM and DM gain for SA and DA circuits versus gain 
difference ΔAf for imbalance α=0 and β=1/9. The balanced CM gain of the DD 
circuit is below the SA CM gain. The DM gain for both structures is similar, 
resulting in improved CMRR, (bottom). 
  
It is observed that the amplified output signal maintains a peak amplitude within the targeted 
span whilst the gain is adjusted between a minimum of 32 V/V and a maximum of 437 V/V, i.e. 
over a 22.7 dB range. In a next step, a ‘live’ ECG signal is recorded using the DD system. The 
nominal amplifier gain is now 440 V/V. The relative gain variation ΔA is around 1.25 %. Fig. 4 
shows the oscilloscope screenshot after the structure achieved balance. Channels 1 and 2 show 
the individual first-rank amplifier output voltages Va and Vb. Noting that the single amplifier 
input voltage Vc is formally given by Va+Vb, oscilloscope channel 4, which displays the summed 
signal CH1+CH2, represents the signal that would be obtained from the single differential 
amplifier circuit. The line interference is clearly visible in the recording (appearing as a 10 Hz 
signal due to undersampling by the storage oscilloscope) in addition to motion artifacts. The DD 
signal measured at the summing amplifier output is shown on channel 3. The interference is 
successfully rejected and also CM artifacts are suppressed by over 20 dB.  
 
Finally, the EMG is obtained by connecting a pair of electrodes to the forearm of a subject and 
 
 
Fig. 4: Oscilloscope screenshot showing the voltages VA, VB, VC=VA+VB recorded 
at the first-rank amplifier outputs, and VODD obtained from the summing 
amplifier output. Undersampled 60 Hz interference is clearly visible in the SA 
trace VC, but it is rejected in the DD output VODD.

artificially scaled by an envelope function (dashed line). 
 
 
IV. Design of the CM/DM Digitizer ASIC 
The ADC architecture used is a single-slope integrating ADC [15]. The conversion circuit 
consists of a bias, a clock generator, a ramp generator, a comparator, and a counter that produces 
the digital output. The block diagram is shown in Fig. 6.  
 
Fig. 6: Block diagram of proposed single-slope integrating ADC block  
At the beginning of a conversion cycle, analog input (Vin) is supplied and used as the 
starting voltage for the ramp generator (which produces the discharge sawtooth waveform). At 
the same time, the clock generator provides a sample clock to the clocked comparator. The 
comparator compares the ramp generator output with Vref voltage from the bias block. The 
counter is started and stopped by the comparator output and converts the ramp discharge time to 
a digitized output. The ramp generator is a current integrator structure consisting of a constant 
current source I discharging a capacitor C. Fig. 7 shows the ramp output and comparator output 
voltages. Vin is the input voltage, t1 is the discharge time measured by the comparator.

The VTC supplies a fixed frequency square wave output at the sampling frequency, but the 
width of the positive period changes with input voltage. The output from VTC is supplied to the 
CM and DM mode counter circuits. 
The VTC capacitor is precharged with the input voltage. Then, a DC current discharges the 
capacitor. The voltage is compared with a reference voltage. The reference voltage comes from 
the bias circuit. The VTC uses an interleaved structure: The switched-capacitor block consists of 
two capacitor branches in parallel as shown in Figure 9. Switches S1/S2/S3/S4 control the 
capacitor charge and discharge. When switches S1 and S3 are closed, C1 will be charged by the 
input voltage and C2 will be discharged with the constant current. Conversely, when switches S2 
and S4 are closed, it is C1 which is being discharged. The discharge current path for C2 is shown 
as the dashed line in Fig. 9. 
 
Fig. 9: Schematic of the time-multiplexed VTC 
 
The CM output block receives Out_1 and Out_2 signals from the pair of VTC, as shown in 
Fig. 10. It uses an OR gate to combine Out_1 and Out_2, in order to get signal A: when either of 
Out_1 or Out_2 is high, signal A will be high. In this case, the clock signal is passed through the 
AND gate to generate a clock signal counter_clk, which is routed to the CM counter.  
 
Fig. 10: Circuit of the CM routing block 
The counter consists of 10 stages of JCK flip-flop (Fig. 11). The conventional counter 
would count upwards in unit steps if either of the input signals is high. However, to achieve CM
