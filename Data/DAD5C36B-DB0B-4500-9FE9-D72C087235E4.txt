1. 中文摘要 
 
本研究針對特定之數位家庭應用領域，以 Petri Net 與 High-Level Fuzzy Petri 
Net (HLFPN)理論作為模組和分析的工具。主要模組與分析層面包含：功能、系
統架構、系統使用狀態、通訊與網路服務等，甚至將 HLFPN 理論應用在數位家
庭平台管理上。家庭網路服務以 Petri Net 與 HLFPN 理論作為分析的基礎，並針
對家庭網路服務本身的特性做系統分析，例如：安全性、正確性、客戶端使用情
形、伺服端運作情形等。 
 
在數位家庭平台管理中，管理項目相當繁多，例如：家電、門禁、娛樂系統管
理等，如上述數位家庭應用的各部份，都有可能被發展在一組控制平台上來進
行控制。如此，在控制的流程上，使用 Petri Net 來模組化整個控制平台，將
控制流程的每一個狀態在實際製作控制平台前作事前模擬，如此對平台的設計
與管理會是更方便與更省時的。 
 
本計畫將利用Petri Net來模組化數位家庭平台管理，並以模組化以後的Petri Net
圖形或其 Incidence Matrix 對選定的數位家庭應用項目做分析評估；也利用各種
Petri Net 的特性作為分析的輔助；為了讓 Petri Net 在數位家庭的領域更加實用，
也將加入各種 Petri Net 的分析方法，例如：Coverability Tree、Incidence Matrix and 
State Equation 、以及 Reduction Rules for Analysis，以提升分析的效率。 
 
計畫主持人在已發表論文”Reinforcement Learning for High-Level Fuzzy Petri 
Nets”裡提到，一 Reinforcement Petri-Net-based Fuzzy Logic Control System 
(RPN-FLCS)能被用來做自動、動態的學習，藉由”獎勵/懲罰”(reward/penalty)的
訊息(i.e., good/bad)或這藉由一相當簡單的模糊回饋訊息(fuzzy feedback signal)， 
例如：“low”、“too low”、“high”與“too high”。 RPN-FLCS 由一 fuzzy controller 
(i.e., action network)和一 fuzzy predictor (i.e., evaluation network)兩個獨立元建構
成。經由使用 temporal difference method，fuzzy predictor 能 predict 出 external 
reinforcement signal 並提供給 fuzzy controller 更多的 informative 和 beforehand 
internal reinforcement signal。同時，reinforcement structure/parameter 學習的演算
法能被允許 action network 的輸出以得到一 stochastic exploration。經過這些
action network 能實行 stochastic searches 來選擇一好的 action 和得到他的誤差輸
出。 
 
數位家庭應用的部份則是以軟體工程的角度出發，以 Petri Net 與 HLFPN 理論
作為模組化和分析的工具，在實際製作該應用軟硬體設施之前，先作難易度評
估和上述所提的分析，以求所完成的設備是有效率以及能更符合使用者的需
求。將 HLFPN 理論應用在數位家庭，就能使用計畫主持人本身既有研究成果，

3. 前言 
 
近年來網際網路蓬勃發展，人們對網路服務(web service)的依賴度也跟著
提高，各式各樣的網路服務電子商務、網路式數位學習、多人連線式網路遊戲、
透過網際網路之數位家庭系統控制等，如何使網路服務更貼近人們的需求，這賴
以網路服務的分析，進而改進服務品質，而有效率的分析方法是非常重要的課
題。派翠網路(Petri Net)係一種數學畫與圖形化之模組系統，經常可用來表示、
模擬某一系統的狀態與運作情形，當然網路服務亦同。再整合入模糊(Fuzzy)理
論，加強分析的客觀性。 
網際網路的發展也對家庭生活帶來相當的改變，與電腦科技、網際網路、無
線網路、家庭網路等與其他通訊技術的結合，誕生了新型態的家庭生活模式-數
位家庭。數位家庭的應用需求也與日俱增。根據 IDC 研究報告顯示，全球資訊
家電產值，將從 2002 年的 340 億美元，成長到 2007 年將達 920 億美元，並且
預計 2008、2009、2010 年亦將逐年成長，年複合成長率為 23％。在行政院 2005 
年產業科技策略會議中，內政部建研究所長預估，到公元 2015 年，全球智慧居
住空間所衍生之相關產業將達 1000 億美元之產值，是臺灣繼資訊產品之後，另
一重要的新興市場。 
數位家庭技術包含了許多，也是國內資訊相關業者持續積極投入的部分，
如：遠端監控、數位居家照護、居家保全與語音、影像辨識、數位影音娛樂、家
電控制、控制機制與控制平台、或人機介面，甚至於居家的數位學習或遠距教學
等包羅萬象。同樣地，使用圖形與數學化的分析，即 Petri Net 作狀態模擬與各
需求的數據分析，之後加入模糊理論作為一客觀的分析。 
在家電控制方面，加入模糊控制，如以模糊理論分析室溫，作為冷暖氣是否
有效運作，溫度偏高或偏低時啟動冷暖氣，在溫度舒適性與電力節省方面，期待
能讓家電有更高效率的運作。家庭網路佈線的部分，在現代人對網際網路依賴的
情況下，書房可能需要用來查詢資料或處理事務上使用的網路、而客廳的娛樂工
具如遊戲機如 PS3 等當下都已能支援上網更新與其他玩家連線的功能，這時佈線

定義如下： 
Definition 7.1: HLFPN  
The high-level fuzzy Petri net (HLFPN) is defined as an 8-tuple:  
HLFPN = ( P, T, F, C, V, , ,  ), 
where 
P = {p1, p2, p3, ..., pk} is a finite set of places; 
T = {t1, t2, t3, ..., tl} is a finite set of transitions; 
P  T   ; 
F  (P  T)  (T  P) is called the flow relation and is also a finite set of arcs, 
each representing the fuzzy set (i.e. fuzzy term) for an antecedent and a 
consequent, respectively; where the positive arcs (i.e. THEN parts) are denoted 
by  and the negative arcs (i.e. ELSE parts) are denoted by; 
C = a finite set of linguistic variables, e.g. X, Y,  and Z; 
        where X = {x1, x2, ..., xn}, Y = {y1, y2, ...,  ym}, Z = {z1, z2, ..., zq}; 
V = {v1, v2, ..., vl} is a finite set of fuzzy truth values known as the fuzzy 
relational matrix between the antecedent and the consequent of a rule; 
  : P  C is an association function, mapping from places to linguistic       
variables, 
(pi) = ci,  i = 1, ..., I, where C = { ci } is a set of linguistic variables in the 
knowledge base ( KB ) and I is the number of linguistic variables in KB; 
  : F  [0, 1] is an association function, mapping from the flow relations to 
the fuzzy truth values between zero and one (i.e. fuzzy sets). 
 : T  V is an association function mapping from transitions to fuzzy relational 
matrices. 
 
7.2 以模擬軟體分析和統計結果 
 
在 Petri Net 模擬軟體方面，transition 的 firing 依需求大致上分兩種，一種是
隨機 fire 各 transitions，另一則是可自行選擇要 fire 的 transitions；前者較方便使
用於結果與效能上的評估，後者則適用在系統各狀態的模擬。 
在較簡單或免費的 Petri Net 模擬軟體大致上只提供了設定各 places 的 token 數
量、weight 值、基本 Petri Net 圖形的繪製功能、與因為製作程式必須的 Incidence 
Matrix 也當成一功能外，分析額外的結構或行為特性在一般免費的軟體並沒有提
供。 
在研究初步，預計先使用免費的模擬軟體，如 pipe、WoPeD、hpsim 等作為

In this work, an informal formative assessment is 
adopted to realize the effects of E-learning. The 
research background is given in the following 
session. The research model relating to this work is 
given in session III. Session IV explains the 
designed E-learning system. The experiment results 
are shown in session V. Finally, a conclusion to this 
work is given in session VI. 
Research Background 
To reflect the students’ learning difficulties, there 
are many styles. Asking questions to the instructor 
is usually applied when students have difficulties in 
learning. Then, the instructor might answer the 
questions by adjusting his teaching technique if it is 
necessary. However, most students could not ask 
questions but maintain a lull reaction. (Fisher & 
Frey, 2007) Especially, they are shy in most Asian 
county. (Cheng, 2000) Another possible situation is 
that they misunderstand. In fact, they do not full 
understand what they learn. Hence, to realize the 
students’ learning, using assessments to collect 
students’ learning progress is applied. (Fisher & 
Frey, 2007)   
In general, there are two kinds of assessment. One 
is summative assessment and the other is formative 
assessment (Fisher & Frey, 2007). The purpose of 
summative assessment is grading, it is used to judge 
the degree of understanding among students. For 
example, term exam is a summative assessment. On 
the other hand, a formative assessment is used to 
help students learn, and realize the students on the 
topics they understand and on the ones they confuse. 
The formative assessment could like an examination 
as that in the summative assessment, and its result 
could be a part of the grade.  However, the grade is 
not important as that in the summative assessment. 
The initiation–response–evaluation or 
initiation–response–feedback sequence is suitable to 
describe the formative assessment (Black & Wiliam, 
2009; Ruiz-Primo & Furtak, 2007). The scenario in 
the formative assessment begins with the instructor.  
The instructor initiates a question, retrieves 
responses from the students, and provides a 
feedback to the students. By using this process, the 
instructor can receive the response from students, 
realize what the students actually don’t understand 
and, then, adjust his teaching formats accordingly. 
Finally, with the formative assessment, the students 
could deeply understand what they have learned and 
improve their learning. 
According to (Ruiz-Primo & Furtak, 2007), the 
formative assessment can be further divided into 
two different types. One is called a formal 
formative assessment. It is pre-scheduled by the 
instructor and likes a one-way reaction. The 
instructor can manage the content of assessment and 
get feedbacks from the students. The other is called 
an informal formative assessment. The informal 
formative assessment is held between any teacher 
and student interactions and likes a two-way 
reaction. Both of them have a similar 
initiation–response–evaluation processing, and a 
similar purpose to help students progress in learning. 
The formal formative assessment is planned by the 
instructor in advance. The instructor can predict 
what information would be gathered from the 
students. However, the time frame and frequency in 
the informal formative assessment are quite 
different. The duration in the informal formative 
assessment is relatively short, and the instructor has 
to react to students immediately. Besides, the time 
schedule in the informal formative assessment is 
random and the instructor could not expect exactly 
to gather the students’ understanding in a 
non-planned activity (Ruiz-Primo & Furtak, 2004). 
Although these formative assessments are two 
different exceptions to gather the information from 
the students, they have a same purpose to realize the 
students in learning.   
Since the purpose of the formative assessments is to 
help students in learning, it is significantly related 
to increasing a positive performance. It is also 
applied to E-learning environment. Burrow used 
TRIADS to build a formative assessment for the 
e-learning environment, and got some positive 
feedbacks. (Burrow et al, 2005) Also, Henly built a 
formative assessment for his e-learning 
environment, and found out students who are in the 
top 10% of the class complete the assessment more 
times than those who are in the bottom 10%. (Henly, 
2003) It shows the formative assessment can 
improve the students’ learning and have a positive 
outcome. Also, there some researches have the 
similar results. (Velan et al. ,2002; Blayney & 
Freeman, 2004; Bull & Stephens, 1999; Charman & 
appearances depending on the group that the 
students belong to. 
(1) Experimental group 
The students will see an area to play the video. 
This area has a control panel that includes some 
functions of a classical video player, such as 
pause, play, forward or backward, and a 
seeking bar. A blank area besides this is the 
area is used to display questions. On the 
bottom-left corner, there are a button and 
several options for answering questions. While 
the instruction video approaches a specific time, 
the video player will pause and the blank area 
will display a question. At this moment, the 
control panel will be hided and the grayed out 
button will become available. Students have to 
read the question, select a proper answer, and 
press the button to continue the video player. If 
the answer is wrong, a “wrong answer” 
message will appear and the students have to 
select an answer again. Until the answer is 
correct, the control panel will not reveal again 
and continue playing the video.  
(2) Control group 
The appearance in the display page is similar to 
that in the experimental group. However, there 
are no questions shown during the video 
playing. When the timeline cursor reaches the 
predefined time, the system will make a record 
that students have studied this material. 
Without the displaying the questionnaire, 
students could study the material continuously. 
Experimental Result  
Although there are 61 students registered in this 
class, 13 students in the two groups use the 
e-learning system to prepare the examinations in 
this experiment. Since the sample size is too small, 
the nonparametric statistic method is used to 
analyze the result. In the experimental group, there 
are 5 students have used the e-learning system 
whereas 8 students in the control group. Table 1 
shows the survey related to the e-learning system 
usage from these 13 students. In the table, PU, 
PEOU, AT and INT represent perceived usefulness, 
perceived easy of use, students’ attitude and 
students’ intention, respectively.

whether there exists a significant difference 
between the survey scores collected in Chapter 1 
exam and the ones collected in Chapter 2 exam.

In Table 2 and Table 3, one can find perceived 
usefulness, perceived ease of use, and students 
attitude toward e-learning do not be any significant 
different within both groups. All p-values are 
greater than 0.1. The control group has a significant 
difference (p-value < 0.1) in students’ intention to 
use the e-learning system. However, in the 
experimental group, there is no significant 
difference.  A Mann-Whitney test within these two 
groups’ data collected in Chapter 2 exam is also 
performed and showed a similarity to the 
paired-sample analysis. It shows in Table 4.

based on linguistic 2-tuples carries out the processes of “computing with words” 
easily and without loss of information and 3) the results of the processes of 
“computing with words” are always expressed in the initial linguistic domain, where a 
linguistic 2-tuples is composed by a linguistic term and a numerical value assessed in 
[-0,5, 0.5] In recent years, some researchers focused on the research topic of the 
models of linguistic 2-tuples and their applications [1]-[3], [6]-[13]. In [1], Alcala and 
Herrera presented a post-processing method of fuzzy rule-based systems by means of 
an evolutionary lateral tuning of linguistic variables to obtain a better accuracy and 
maintaining a good interpretability, where their method considers a rule representation 
scheme by using the linguistic 2-tuples representation which allows the lateral 
variation of the involved labels. In [2], Alcala et al. presented a method to obtain 
linguistic fuzzy systems by means of an evolutionary learning of the data base a priori 
and on the use of a basic rule generation method to obtain the whole knowledge base, 
where the search space reduction provided by the linguistic 2-tuples representation 
helps to the evolutionary search technique to obtain more precise and compact 
knowledge base. In [3], Alcala et al. presented a method to perform an evolutionary 
lateral tuning of membership functions to obtain linguistic models with higher levels 
of accuracy while maintaining good interpretability, where they consider a rule 
representation scheme based on the linguistic 2-tuples representation. In [6], Dong et 
al. presented an optimization method to compute the numerical scale of the linguistic 
term set for the 2-tuples fuzzy linguistic representation model. In [8], Herrera and 
Martinez presented a 2-tuples fuzzy linguistic representation model for computing 
with words without any loss of information. In [9], Herrera and Martinez presented a 
model based on linguistic 2-tuples for dealing with multi-granular hierarchical 
linguistic contexts in multi-expert decision making. In [10], Huynh et al. developed a 
linguistic decision model based on the 2-tuples linguistic representation for 
2. Preliminaries 
 In this section, we briefly review the fuzzy linguistic approach and the linguistic 
2-tuples representation model from [9]. The fuzzy linguistic approach represents 
qualitative aspects as linguistic values by means of linguistic variables, which has 
successfully been applied to deal with group decision making problems. It is very 
important to choose appropriate linguistic descriptors for the linguistic term set and 
their semantics. The cardinality of a linguistic term set is usually an odd number, 
where the middle linguistic term in a linguistic term set represents an assessment of 
“approximately 0.5” and the rest of the linguistic terms being placed symmetrically 
around it. Once the cardinality of a linguistic term set has been determined, the 
linguistic terms and their semantics should be provided. Assume that there is a 
linguistic term set S = {s0, s1, …, sg}, where the cardinality of the linguistic term set S 
is g + 1, then there are the following properties: 
1) si ≤ sj if and only if i ≤ j. 
2) Neg(si) = sj, where Neg is the negation operator of linguistic terms and j = ig  . 
Definition 2.1 [9]: Assume that S = {s0, s1, …, sg} is a linguistic term set and 
assume that ] ,0[ g  is the result of a symbolic aggregation operation, then the 
linguistic 2-tuples representing the equivalent information to the value is obtained 
by the function S , shown as follows: 
 )5.0 ,5.0[] ,0[:  SgS ,

where i = round(  ), ,i  siS, “round” is the traditional rounding operation, si 
has the closest index label to , is the value of the symbolic translation and ) ,( is is 
called a linguistic 2-tuples. 
Example 2.1: Assume that a symbolic aggregation operation using the terms in the 
linguistic term set S = {s0, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6} obtains  = 2.7, then based on Eq. (1),

3. The Proposed Similarity Measure Between Intervals of Linguistic 2-Tuples 
and the Proposed Intervals of Linguistic 2-Tuples Weighted Average Operator  
In this section, we propose a similarity measure between intervals of linguistic 
2-tuples and propose the intervals of linguistic 2-tuples weighted average operator. 
Definition 3.1: Assume that there are two linguistic term sets A = {a0, a1, …, ar} 
and B ={b0, b1, …, bs}, then a linguistic 2-tuples (ai, αi) in domain A can be 
transformed into a linguistic 2-tuples in domain B by the transformation function AB . 
In the same way, a linguistic 2-tuples (bj, αj) in domain B can be transformed into a 
linguistic 2-tuples in domain A by the transformation function BA , where AB and BA  
are defined as follows:

4. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have presented a method to calculate the degree of similarity 
between intervals of linguistic 2-tuples and have presented the intervals of linguistic 
2-tuples weighted average operator. The proposed similarity measure between 
intervals of linguistic 2-tuples and the proposed intervals of linguistic 2-tuples 
weighted average operator can be used for fuzzy group decision making based on the 
linguistic 2-tuples representation.
