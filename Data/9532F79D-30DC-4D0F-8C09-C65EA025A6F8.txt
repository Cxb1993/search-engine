摘要 
關鍵字：疾病相關基因、選擇性剪接、資料探勘、智慧型代理人、樣式選擇、樣式權重、
資訊擷取。 
在人類基因體計畫(Human Genome Project)完成定序後，越來越多的人投入生物資訊
(Bioinformatics)的研究行列，不管是在序列的預測、藥物的研發或是疾病的治療等，都是重
要的研究課題。本計畫提出一個疾病相關基因探勘與預測之整合系統，提供收集文獻資料
並且提供查詢疾病相關基因的選擇性剪接(alternative splicing)資訊。本方法能提供生物醫學
研究人員在生物實驗驗證時的相關資訊，縮短生物實驗驗證的時間。使用者可以輸入基因
名稱(gene name)、去氧核醣核酸序列(DNA sequence)，並選擇疾病相關基因的權重矩陣
(weight matrix)，經由系統分析與預測後，輸出疾病相關資訊，像是完整的基因序列、mRNA、
內子(intron)、外子(exon)、選擇性剪接、摘要報告等，並以圖形介面輸出。 
利用關鍵字搜尋文獻的時候，有些人往往遭遇到對要找尋的內容不熟悉而無法給予重
要的字詞作為關鍵字來搜尋的困境。在這個計畫中，我們提出一個『利用文件查詢』的方
法，來幫助那些因為事先沒有概念去給定關鍵字來做文件搜尋的使用者。為了得到可信賴
的搜尋結果，並且在短的回覆時間內完成查詢，所有的文件都事先根據具有適當權重的樣
式來轉成向量，根據這些向量之間的距離來判斷相似度的大小，並且將相似度大於某個給
定閥值的文件，依照相似度的大小排列出來。我們計畫選擇相關生物資訊的字辭，如基因
或蛋白質的名稱，來做為代表性的樣式，並且根據這些樣式在原始文獻中的出現頻率分佈
來調整其權重。 
1. Background 
After the Human Genome Project is completed, more and more researchers involve in the 
research of bioinformatics. No matter the prediction of sequence, research and development of 
medicine or treatment of the disease etc. are all important research subjects. As for the cancer, the 
cause of cancer is the abnormal expression of gene, and abnormal expression of these genes will 
cause the un-stability of DNA, such as translocation, amplification and deletion. Furthermore, 
some genes will carry on the alternative splicing to produce different proteins. But the slicing will 
be affected by the result of point mutation. The gene amplification or gene deletion occurred in a 
large chromosome region can be found by two methods: the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and the 
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). If the verification is conducted through the biological 
experiment directly at the beginning, it will take a lot of manpower and materials. If the research 
and analysis of bioinformatics is conducted before the verification of biological experiment, it 
will narrow the scope of possible factors, and obtain the relevant information for reference. It can 
surely reduce the waste caused by wrong experiment. 
2. Purpose 
This proposal proposes an integrated system for disease-related genes mining and prediction 
from biomedical literatures. This system can collect the biomedical literatures and query the 
alternative splicing information of disease-related genes. This research can provide the relevant 
information to the biologists and shorten the time for the verification of biological experiment. 
The user can input gene name, DNA sequence, any compound words, or documents, then select 
the weight matrix. After it is analyzed and predicted by the system, it can output the 
disease-related information, such as complete disease gene sequence, mRNA, intron, exon, 
alternative splicing, summary report, etc., and showed by the graphic interface. 
3. Methodology 
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate an integrated system for disease-related gene 
research. This system is a biomedical literature mining system based on intelligent agent 
technology, can extract disease-related genes from a large amount of biomedical literature, and 
examine its feasibility for proceeding following researches and experiments. This study designs 
several models to reach this purpose and demonstrate different results with web page, as shown in 
Figure 1. The function of each model is respectively explicated as follows: 
4. Results and Conclusions 
This study proposes an integrated system for disease-related gene research based on 
biomedical literature mining. As shown in Figure 2, this system can find out chromosome regions 
that disease possibly produced and disease-related genes. And the system will show the disease 
name and calculate a weight to each chromosome region as its importance. Therefore, different 
gene information can be analyzed. The methods can find out important information in large 
amount of biomedical literature and conduct analysis to information for biomedical researchers. It 
is helpful for the future studies or experiments. It can not only accelerate the study and also 
greatly reduce the time for integrating and analyzing biomedical literature.

In the future work, there will be more and more various types of biomedical literature and 
the overall information volume will therefore increase continuously. We consider porting this 
system to distributed environment for accelerating the information processing.
