傳統感性工學研究多是以問卷擷取轉化人們的感受，這的確能方便取得並轉
換人們的想法，但這可能會遇到一些問題，例如受測者不能清楚表達出內心所想，
或是問題太過抽象或是複雜，以至於回應有所偏差，最終影響了實驗結果分析與
判斷。相較於問卷所得到的心理主觀資料，生理數值量測則是針對受測者的感知
反應，人的感知反應是非常敏銳的，往往改變是在沒有察覺的情形下做出反應，
也較難以刻意控制，因此較為客觀。而本研究使用監測瞳孔尺寸來做為人們對於
刺激物的生理反應值，並輔以問卷評量的方式，針對 IAPS裡的 48張刺激物與
48張開瓶器進行實驗。結果顯示瞳孔尺寸可以明顯的分辨出三類 IAPS刺激物的
差異性；而在開瓶器部分，根據受測者的反應則可以將刺激物分為兩類：負向情
緒與其它（正向與中性情緒）。在觀看產品時瞳孔反應與觀看 IAPS刺激物相比，
有整體偏正向情緒的跡象，這是值得未來進一步研究之處，根據兩刺激物的結果
支持本研究的假設，受測者瞳孔變化與主觀評價之間有所關聯。 
 
關鍵字：瞳孔尺寸、感性工學、情緒激起、情緒質性
  
1. 研究背景動機與目的  
以「感性工學」的角度來說，感性即為消費者購買產品時，心理所產生的感
覺意象做為選擇的判斷，如安全感、豪華、信心、滿意。目前感性工學中大部分
研究著眼於如何架構感性意象與產品造形之間的關係，已有相當多成功的案例研
究，例如汽車設計上的運用(Jindo & Hirasago, 1997)、辦公室座椅(Jindo, Hirasago, 
& Nagamachi, 1995)，設計師與使用者對產品感知的語意差異探討(Hsu, Chuang, 
& Chang, 2000)，由此可見感性工學藉由問卷來擷取個人對於產品主觀感受資料，
透過感性量化的研究，將人們對於產品感性詞彙，轉換成其相對應造形特徵的作
用是受到重視的；而亦有學者利用卡通表情圖案取代形容詞詞彙，希望能使受測
者對於該評量項目有更清楚的體認(Desmet, Overbeeke, & Tax, 2001; Desmet, 
Porcelijn, & van Dijk, 2007)，希望能透過較明確的呈現方式來取代文字上的解
釋。 
然而，心理數值量測很容受外界的影響，潛在著一些問題，例如受測者有時   
因內向，很難把內心所想的充分表達出來，或是不能清楚的表達出產品不同之處
(Laparra-Hernandez, Belda-Lois, Medina, Campos, & Poveda, 2009)，亦有可能問題
太過複雜難以清楚的表達，受測者就可能會自行在內心修正欲回答的答案，在無
形中就會影響到實驗者(Czerwinski, Horvitz, & Cutrell, 2001; Nielsen & Levy, 
1994)。受測者在實驗過程中亦可能在實驗者暗示之下做出其他的選擇(Regueiro 
& Leon, 2003)，這些都會扭曲了受測者的選擇，如此一來，將收集到的資料進行
分析，就猶如隔著一層紗進行解讀，無法貼近受測者的真實想法。 
生理數值量測是針對受測者對於刺激的感知反應，人的感知反應是非常敏銳
的，若是一件產品令受測者有好的印象，屆時會引發出正向情緒，因此，人們的
偏好可以透過分析情緒而被了解(Laparra-Hernandez et al., 2009)。相較於主觀評
量，人們較難控制自身生理資訊，若從這角度來看，生理數值量測較能客觀的反
應出內心的喜好；但生理資料較難直接說明數值的變化是因何種刺激所致。因此，
本研究採用生理數值量測的資料，輔以心理主觀表述資訊，以達到真正貼近人們
真實的感受。 
Hess(1965)提到可以由瞳孔大小了解那人對某事物的關心程度和興趣多寡。
在心理學領域中，有學者針對瞳孔的反應進行研究，利用量測瞳孔尺寸變化量來
評估，受測者對於刺激物圖片引發的情緒反應為何(Bradley, Miccoli, Escrig, & 
  
b. 瞳孔尺寸是否適用於產品評價上 
2. 研究方法  
依據文獻得知，人們面對喜歡或是感到興趣的事物時，會激起瞳孔尺寸的變
化，而引起的生理反應目前無法用來判別是由何種情緒所引起的，因此本研究基
於傳統感性工學調查產品感性意象的方式，搭配評價過程中人們的生理反應提出
兩個假設： 
H1：瞳孔尺寸量測與 Likert尺度評量之間有關聯性。 
H2：運用瞳孔尺寸量測與 Likert尺度評量可以分辨出刺激物引發人們的情緒  
性質為何。 
2.1 實驗進行與步驟  
 為驗證本研究兩個假設，本研究實驗有兩種類型的刺激物，一類是文獻上
已被驗證的圖庫資料，另一類則是選用產品-開瓶器。會選用開瓶器做為產品類
型代表，是因為其為較單純化的產品，設計限制也較少，因此設計師在進行設計
時較能盡情發揮，將想要表達的情感藉由產品為載體傳遞給使用者。 
本研究分為三個階段： 
階段一：收集刺激物 
一般此類研究多是心理領域相關研究，因此刺激物多是人臉或是事件照，而
非以產品為主要刺激物，本研究將刺激物分為兩類一類為文獻上所使用的
International Affective Picture System (IAPS)(Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2008)資料
庫；另外一類希望透過單一產品品項來減少影響的因子，因此，另一類均為網路
上收集而來的開瓶器圖片。 
階段二：挑選刺激物 
為挑選出較具代表性的刺激物，IAPS資料庫圖片部分，參考 Bradley et 
al.(2008)所採用 IAPS刺激物，刪除不同文化可能會有不同反應的刺激物，例如
性或是裸體等，並以 IAPS其它圖片取代a，16張正向情緒((mean pleasure/arousal 
= 7.6, 5.2)、16張中性情緒((mean neutral/arousal = 4.8, 3.4) 、16張負向情緒((mean 
                                                
a IAPS圖片編號：正向情緒：1440, 1460, 2070, 2165, 2311, 2332, 2340, 2341, 4614, 8370, 8470, 
8492, 8496, 8500, 8501, 8540；中性情緒：2026, 2411, 2745.1, 2880, 5471, 5535, 6150, 7055, 7092, 
7130, 7211, 7224, 7491, 7547, 7595, 7632；負向情緒：1120, 1930, 2095, 3301, 6260, 6311, 6510, 6571, 
9000, 9043, 9102, 9163, 9295, 9413, 9427, 9940 
  
秒內習慣內習慣亮度，以及視覺資訊量與之後目標刺激物在視覺資訊量是一致的，
也就是說打亂效果刺激物與目標刺激物的差別只在於受測者是否可以辨識出刺
激物內容為何與否，也有助於解釋受測者瞳孔的變化情形是受刺激物內容不同所
致。 
2.2 受測者  
三十二位受測者參與本研究，但其中有五位受測者有資料遺失，因此最後根
據 27位受測者資料進行分析，其中男性 12人，女性 15人平均年齡為 25.75，年
齡範圍為 20-35，均為至少具兩年以上設計背景工業設計系學生。 
2.3 資料處理與分析  
將每張刺激物呈現期間各秒的瞳孔尺寸資料加以平均，資料遇到遺漏值的部
份，使用 SPSS 19 依據內插法補遺漏值，並使用 SPSS 19 repeat measure ANOVA
受測者內進行資料分析。 
3. 結果  
分析觀看 IAPS刺激物受測者瞳孔尺寸資料，可以發現受測者在觀看正向情
緒、中性情緒、負向情緒的瞳孔尺寸之間有顯著性差異 F(2,47)＝54.137, p< .001
（表 1）。從圖 2可以看出受測者觀看正向情緒與負向情緒刺激物時，瞳孔尺寸
相較中性刺激物較大。

Birbaumer, & Lang, 2000; Purkis, Lipp, Edwards, & Barnes, 2009)，藉由同時進行
IAPS圖庫資料與本研究蒐集而來開瓶器圖片，相互比較其結果，透過 IAPS結果
來間接證明本研究另一類刺激物其結果亦值得信任。從圖 2可以看見在觀看
IAPS不同情緒刺激物時，瞳孔的尺寸趨勢與與之前文獻趨勢相同(Bradley et al., 
2008)，也就是在觀看較能激起(arousal)情緒的刺激物時（即正向及負向兩種情緒
刺激物），人們的瞳孔尺寸相較於觀看中性刺激物時呈現較大，如同 Bradley et al. 
(2008)指出在觀看具情感的圖片時，瞳孔的反應可以反映出情緒的激起與否並與
交感神經反應一致，但卻無法分辨出是何種情緒所引發的，即正負向情緒刺激物
所引起瞳孔尺寸變化並沒有顯著差異，但本研究結果顯示，觀看正向情緒與負向
情緒刺激物引起的瞳孔尺寸變化兩者間有顯著性差異，也就是透過瞳孔尺寸可以
分辨出人們在觀看何種類型刺激物時所引起的情緒反應。這也許是由於 Bradley 
et al.在 2008所選用的負向情緒圖片激起較為強烈(e.g.屍體、戰爭)，而本研究將
那類刺激物替換成其它較不會造成受測者內心陰影的圖片(e.g. 死亡畫面改為受
傷)，也就是極端程度不同，負向情緒的刺激量相對較低，因而出現觀看正向情
緒與負向情緒刺激物時的瞳孔值有顯著差異。 
反觀開瓶器圖片則呈現不同的結果，僅有在受測者觀看負向產品時有顯著性
的差異，也就是透過瞳孔的量測無法分辨出正向與中性的刺激物，瞳孔在觀看負
向意象產品時，瞳孔值卻沒如同觀看 IAPS負向意象刺激物時，瞳孔尺寸呈現較
大的現象，相反地卻出現在觀看 IAPS中性意象刺激物時瞳孔的反應，即瞳孔尺
寸較小的現象。本研究未將刺激物的激起程度一併考慮，導致瞳孔反應不如預期
般收縮，一般針對產品進行評鑑中，針對刺激物的評價並未特別考慮到激起程度，
而激起程度是人們對於刺激物情感反應與否的決定性關鍵(Purkis et al., 2009)，故
我們會認為新奇的設計產品在激起程度上，相較一般產品應是有較高的表現，但
產品為求在市面上販售，雖會針對各種不同使用者的需求進行設計生產，然而，
產品類型往往多是朝向令人感到正向情緒的設計，因此較少市面上產品設計訴求
是想令使用者感到負向情緒的設計，這也可能是導致本研究刺激物-開瓶器未能
涵蓋具有令人感到負向情緒且激起程度高的開瓶器之原因。在一般研究中，挑選
產品引發使用者情感的研究中，所挑選的刺激物多半亦沒有考慮激起程度對結果
的影響，這或許是未來感性工學相關研究應用瞳孔值做為生理指標時，可以加入
考慮的部份。 
產品不若畫作或是人臉照片只傳達出某種情緒，而是混和的情緒；產品引發

Summary 
 
The goal of this visit is to participate in the 5th conference on Designing Pleasurable 
Products and Interfaces which held by Politecnico di Milano. The designing of 
pleasurable products and interfaces has attracted more and more research attentions 
and it is becoming a fast growing research topic. Attending this conference help us to 
understand the different approaches toward pleasurable researches among Eastern and 
Western culture. In addition, through the organization committee of this conference, I 
also learned that we should make the most of our human resources which is our PhD 
students. In one hand, this can help students to gain better experiences in organizing a 
project and, on the other, this can help school to establish better international research 
connections.

ABSTRACT 
Users build up their product experiences through all senses. To 
understand how these senses work together, how their importance 
change through time, and how senses evoke positive and negative 
emotions would be very helpful for designers to create more 
pleasant user experiences and improve user’s evaluation about the 
product. 
In the study, we base on Fenko et al.’s study (2010) and use three 
qualitative methods (observations, interviews, and diaries) to 
gather more detailed information from a female participant about 
the early stage of product usage, which is the key period for a user 
to evaluate a product. We ask participant to squeeze juice with an 
electric juicer for a month. We then discuss the multisensory 
experiences, the sensory dominance, and emotions evoked by 
senses at six different usage stages during the month. 
The results suggest that vision is the most important sense when 
participant getting familiar with the product. However, the 
importance of each sense changes right at the first time of 
operation. Later from the first week to the fourth week of usage, 
touch becomes the most important sense, which is related to the 
main function of the product. Also, emotions evoked by senses are 
very likely to affect the importance of each sense. In this case, we 
find the emotional feelings of touch are unsatisfied and neglected. 
This reminds us most of the designers today still focus most on 
vision but little on other senses. Designers should pay more 
attention to which sense plays the most important role at different 
stages and try to bring users more positive emotions and 
experiences.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Product Multisensory Experiences 
Everyday people explore the world through five senses. When 
interacting with a product, different senses all work together to 
create one’s own experiences, which can be richer and reach a 
higher quality if one use more senses at a time (Schifferstein & 
Spence, 2008). Each sensory modality plays a different role 
during each experience. Some senses pay more attention to 
functional operation (Schifferstein & Cleiren, 2005), while others 
evoke stronger emotions (Spence, 2002) and deeper memories 
(Herz & Schooler, 2002). All these information gathered become 
one’s multisensory product experiences (Ludden, Schifferstein, & 
Hekkert, 2006; Schifferstein & Spence, 2008). Thus, it is 
important for a designer to realize how senses work together and 
change their roles when a user interacting with a product. Taking 
senses into consideration can help designers to create a long-
lasting product, which can satisfy consumer’s multisensory 
experiences and create positive emotions (Lindstrom, 2005; 
Schifferstein & Spence, 2008). 
1.2 Roles of Senses 
Vision usually plays a functional role during user-product 
interaction. Vision can gather the most of information in the 
shortest time so that one can operate a product correctly 
(Schifferstein & Cleiren, 2005; Spence, 2002). Olfaction, on the 
other hand, is seemed as emotional sense that memories evoked 
by smell are usually stronger and more emotional (Herz & 
Schooler, 2002; Schifferstein & Desmet, 2007; Spence, 2002). 
Touch can recognize objects like vision (Gibson, 1962) and also 
play an important role in human’s relationship (Spence, 2002). 
Furthermore, it also affects the relationship between user and 
product that familiar objects may become unfamiliar when 
blocking one’s sense of touch (Schifferstein & Desmet, 2007). 
Audition is one of the main senses communicating with the 
outside world (Schifferstein & Desmet, 2007). However, taste, 
among five senses, has the least influence on non-food product 
(Schifferstein, 2006) and the least intensity of sensory impression 
(Bartoshuk, et al., 2002). Hence, the multisensory product 
experiences we discuss in this study include vision, touch, 
audition, and olfaction, while the taste is excluded. 
works. During the process researcher observes how participant 
interact with the product. There is an interview when participant 
feels ok to begin. 
Stage 2 at the first time of operation: this is the very first time that 
participant starts to carry out the task. Researcher observes during 
the task and has an interview with participant after that. 
Stage 3 during the first week of usage: participant does the task at 
home and writes a diary after each time of operation during the 
first week. At the end of the week, there is another interview. 
Stage 4 during the second week of usage: participant does the task 
and writes diaries during the second week. There is an interview 
after the second week. 
Stage 5 during the third week of usage: participant does the task 
and writes diaries during the third week. There is an interview 
after the third week. 
Stage 6 during the fourth week of usage: participant does the task 
and writes diaries during the fourth week. After the fourth week 
there is a last interview to end the experiment. 
2.4.2 Task 
The main task is to squeeze juice with the electric juicer. We 
divide the task into four main steps and describe the detailed 
procedure as follows: 
Step 1 preparing: Participant picks fruits, and then washes the 
fruits, the knife, and the parts of juicer. Then she assembles the 
juicer and plugs it. The fruits (usually oranges) are cut into half 
and then everything is well prepared that participant can start to 
squeeze juice. 
Step 2 squeezing juice: Participant squeezes juice by pressing a 
halved orange onto the cone and the juicer would start to extract 
juice from the fruit. The cone would automatically change 
directions whenever participant lifts and presses down the fruit. 
Participant can also adjust the pulp scale to control the quantity of 
fruit pulp in the juice. 
Step 3 serving the juice: When completing the extraction of juice, 
participant can pour juice out of the jug into a glass and drink it 
whenever she wants to. 
Step 4 cleaning: Participant unplugs the juicer and disassembles 
it. Participant cleans up the pulps left on the strainer, washes parts 
of the juicer, cleans the table, and then storages the product. 
2.4.3 Qualitative Methods 
Qualitative research’s data usually comes from multiple sources 
(Creswell, 2009). In this study we use observations, interviews, 
and diaries to collect data; and the details are shown in Table 1. 
Table 1. Three qualitative methods used in this study 
Method 1 Observations 
Type Observer as participant 
Time to use Stage 1 & Stage 2 
Procedure The participant operates the product with one 
researcher aside. Participant is encouraged to 
say what lays in mind. The process is recorded 
with video. 
Advantages Allows researcher to get first-hand information 
and have a chance to find out something 
unusual (Creswell, 2009). 
Limitations Disturbance may exist because of researcher’s 
attendance (Creswell, 2009). Participant tends 
to discuss with researcher about her findings 
while participant ought not to. 
Method 2 Interviews 
Type Face to face, one on one 
Time to use After each stage, totally six times. 
Procedure Interviews are hold in a lab and recorded with 
video. There is a list of open-ended questions 
for researcher to check. The purposes of the 
first interview are two: to know how participant 
feels at the first time interacting with the 
product, and to understand her previous 
experiences about this kind of product. The 
purpose of the other five interviews is to 
discuss two main issues about multisensory 
product experiences: a) importance of senses, b) 
emotions evoked by senses. 
Advantages Researcher can adjust questions or ask for more 
detailed information according to participant’s 
answers in time. Researcher can get information 
which may be ignored in the diaries. 
Limitations Participant may be affected because of 
researcher’s presence (Creswell, 2009). 
Interviews usually take place at a lab, which is 
different from natural setting (Creswell, 2009). 
Therefore, the last time of interview (stage 6) 
would take place at participant’s home, where 
she chooses to juice. So that researcher can 
observe the environment in person. 
Method 3 Documents 
Type Diaries 
Time to use From Stages 3 to Stages 6 
Procedure During the experiment, participant is asked to 
operate the product at home and write a diary 
after each time of operation. Around 21~25 
oranges would be given to participant every 
week. There is a designated sample form for 
participant to write a diary and also a list of 
issues for participant to check whenever she 
needs something to refer to. Participant is 
encouraged to take pictures of the environment 
or the situation when doing the tasks. 
Advantages Allows researcher to collect participant’s 
natural words (Creswell, 2009), which may be 
not easy to explain orally. Participant is more 
likely to think deeper without intrusion. 
Participant may note interesting issues or useful 
information (Creswell, 2009), which are not 
mentioned in the interview. There is no need to 
transcript from oral to text (Pedgley, 2007). 
Limitations The data may be less organized. There may be 
“under-report” situation (Wild, McMahon, 
Darlington, Culley, & Liu, 2010). 
2.5 Data Analysis 
First, we gather all the data from the notes of observations, 
verbatim of interviews, and participant’s diaries. After reading 
through all the data, we start to sort each sentence into three 
“When the extraction of the juice is completed, the sound 
disappears suddenly and there’s only the feeling of touch left,” 
participant said that it’s “sticky, and not very comfortable.” 
The role of vision is to find out something new and interesting. 
For example, participant would keep her eyes on the transparent 
jug, “when the juice dropping down, it looks just like raining on a 
small island.” When participant described this experience, she 
also mentioned her emotion that it’s pleasing to look at the juice 
dropping down. She would also look at the cone and the strainer 
around because there were more and more pulps heaping on it.  
Participant only smelt the favor of juice (“it smells nice”) after 
completing the extraction when swinging juice to mix it well.  
3.2.3 Stage Three 
During the first week of usage, touch becomes the most important 
sensory modality, followed by vision, olfaction, and audition. 
According to the first day’s diary, touch has become the most 
important sensory modality, along with audition. In the interview, 
however, audition is placed the last while touch remains the first. 
Participant reported that her hands felt tired and muscular pains 
appeared after pressing for a while both in diaries and the 
interview. Her hands could also feel the cone turning around and 
around. Some part of the cone would directly contact with her 
fingers. In the diary (W1D5), participant described this feeling 
“sometimes it hurts, and sometime it’s comfortable.” There was an 
incident when participant trying to assemble the juicer (Diary 
W1D5). Because she forgot to assemble the juicer before plugging 
it, when she pressed down the cone the juicer began to work, 
“then my hand… becomes orange… orz” she wrote. 
Through vision, participant kept finding something new in this 
week, especially when there were different kinds of fruits 
(grapefruit and kiwi). What participant saw sometimes would 
evoke associations. For example, when she saw different colors 
appearing like concentric circles in juice (“the outer circle is 
orange and the inner circle is grapefruit”), she thought of the 
colorful soup in a game. After the juice being well mixed, she 
imagined the color of orange turning into the color of sky in the 
dusk. 
The other places participant would pay attention to are: the 
surface of the orange rising up and down when being pressed 
(“it’s very humor!”); the way juice dropping down (“if orange 
juice dropping down is like light rain, grapefruit juice dropping 
down is like pouring water.”); the quantity of juice; and the 
achievement (”the glass of juice looks perfect” and “it’s happy to 
see the fruitful results.”) 
In the interview, participant remarked that “when pressing down 
the orange, the smell comes out.” And the smell coming from the 
fruit would make participant feel happy. 
The sound of the juicer became noises, which made participant 
feel embarrassing if there was somebody (her roommates) else 
around. But after few days of usage (recorded in Dairy W1D4), 
participant got used to the sound and had no feeling about it. 
3.2.4 Stage Four 
During the second week of usage, touch is still the most important 
sense, olfaction becomes the second, vision drops to the third, and 
audition remains the last. 
Participant had reported muscular pains of hands in most of the 
diaries in this week. (In five diaries, this situation was mentioned 
four times. Participant described the feeling of touch was like 
“massage” in the excepted one, on which day participant felt more 
relaxed and in a good mood.) Whenever the feeling of muscular 
pains showed up, it also brought participant more or less anxiety 
and fretful feeling and made she want to finish the job faster. “I 
can always feel it (the cone) touching my hand,” participant said 
in the interview. There is another reason that touch dominates at 
this stage that participant told in the interview, “because others 
(=other senses) can no longer have new tricks.” 
In three diaries and the interview participant told that the sweet 
smell of juice would make her feel better and more relaxed. 
However, if there was no sweet smell, it would “be easier to lose 
my patience...><” written in a diary (W2D2). 
On the first day of this week participant mentioned that “looking 
at a big glass of juice would give me a sense of achievement.” In 
other diaries participant would also use vision to check if the 
orange being extracted completely and how much juice has been 
extracted. In the interview, participant said that “there is no 
special finding, so there’s not much feeling either.” Also because 
some juice would squirt when extracting, participant had to pay 
more attention to look where had been squirted that she had to 
clean it up later. 
Audition had only been mentioned in the diary on the last day of 
this week, participant wrote in her diary that “~ buzz buzz buzz 
buzz ~ I’ve already got used to it =w=~.” 
3.2.5 Stage Five 
During the third week of usage, touch still places the first. 
Audition’s importance arises to the second while olfaction 
becomes the third. And vision becomes the least important one. 
Participant still reported the feeling of muscular pains of hands 
this week. In the interview participant mentioned that “maybe it’s 
because that the fresh feeling in the beginning no longer exists, 
and it’s not that interesting. So after pressing for a while my hand 
feels sore. I would change another hand, then.” About the feeling 
of the finger contacting with the turning cone, participant 
described that “my fingers can still feel the dadadadada.” The 
word “dadadadada” combines the sound with the feeling of 
touch.  
In one diary (W3D2), participant noted that when she was tired, 
she may feel the sound more annoy and hope to get the task done 
quicker. “(The importance of) audition has risen apparently,” 
participant said in the interview, “because every time when it 
(cone) changes direction, the sound would also changes. And now 
it cannot turn (into another direction) fluently, there’s strange 
sound coming up. It’s very funny.” Participant described the sound 
like “umm~ guaguaguagua~ umm~ guaguaguagua .” 
Participant described the olfaction in her diaries like: “the smell is 
very rich (W3D1)” and “there is strong aroma of orange 
(W3D2).” In the interview, she commented that “oranges become 
mature recently and the odor is very strong.” 
When talking about vision in the interview, participant found that 
“the cone on the top is scraped by the seeds and has some 
scratches, so the color of fruit would stick in there. I have to wash 
them very hard.” This affected her evaluation toward the product, 
“makes me wonder that if the lifespan of this product is short?” 
“Vision is not very important,” commented participant later in the 
interview, ”I would only look at pulps flowing down.” In one diary 
 
Figure 4. Distribution of emotions 
 
Figure 5. Number of positive, negative, and impartial 
emotions evoked by vision, touch, audition, and olfaction 
 
Figure 6. The sensory importance and emotions at six stages 
We combine Figure 3, which shows the sensory dominance 
through time, with the emotions evoked by senses at six stages 
together and create Figure 6. Because each week the times 
participant doing the task may be different, we use average 
number to present the times of emotions from stage 3 to 6. 
By looking at the emotional part alone (bar chart), stage 2 evokes 
more emotions than others and then followed by stage 3. By 
Putting the emotions and sensory importance altogether, we can 
find out some correlations. At stage 2 when participant operated 
the product at the first time, audition evokes the most emotions 
(pink bar) and is selected to be the most important sense (pink 
line). The number of emotions evoked by vision and touch are the 
same, while the two senses are both second important. There is no 
emotion evoked by olfaction, which shows the least importance.  
The importance of vision (blue line) drops from stage 3 to 5 and 
rises at stage 6, and so does the times vision evokes emotions 
(blue bar). At stage 3 and 4 audition shows the least importance 
(pink line) and evokes little emotions (pink bar). At stage 5 and 6 
the importance of audition is raised and so the emotions evoked 
by audition are increased. The importance of olfaction (yellow 
line) places the last at stage 1, 2, and 6. The number of emotions 
evoked by olfaction (yellow bar) is zero at stage 1 and 2. At stage 
6, olfaction also evokes the fewest emotions comparing with other 
senses. Touch (green line) dominates from stage 3 to 6; however, 
the emotions it evokes (green bar) are not always the most. 
3.3.2 Discussion 
From Figure 6, we can see that the sensory dominance is highly 
correlated with emotions. However, the green line, which shows 
the importance of touch, are always far higher than the green bar, 
which shows the emotions touch evoked. Furthermore, among the 
emotions touch evoked are mostly negative (Figure 5). That is, 
although touch is the most important sensory modality since the 
first week of usage, the emotional feelings of touch are not been 
satisfied. The feeling of touch is neglected. 
Fenko et al.’s study (2010) has discussed that which sense 
dominates the pleasant and unpleasant experiences. Their result 
suggests that vision and touch are two main senses in the pleasant 
experiences, followed by audition and olfaction (Fenko, et al., 
2010). The importance of touch is the highest in unpleasant 
experiences while vision places the second, audition is the third, 
and olfaction is the fourth (Fenko, et al., 2010). This is alike with 
our finding that emotions evoked by senses are mostly caused by 
vision and touch. Touch causes the most of negative emotions 
while vision evokes the most of positive emotions. This reflects 
that most designs nowadays focus much on vision but little on 
touch (this is also mentioned in Fenko, et al., 2010; Spence, 
2002). Since touch plays both functional and emotional roles, 
designers should be more careful in dealing with user experiences 
toward touch. Otherwise touch may evoke negative emotions and 
bring user unpleasant experiences. 
4. GENERAL DISCUSSION 
4.1 Major Findings 
Vision is the most important sense when user getting familiar with 
the product for the first time. However, sensory dominance may 
change right at the first time of operation that audition became the 
most important sense in this study because it evoked the strongest 
emotions. From the first week of usage to a month, sensory 
dominance may depend on the main function of the product that 
touch is chosen to be the most important sense in the case of 
electric juicer. 
Emotions evoked by senses are very likely to affect the 
importance of each sense. Today, most of the designers still focus 
on the visual part because consumers’ purchase behaviors rely 
mostly on the sense of vision (see also in Fenko, et al., 2010). 
However, the product experiences after buying are also very
