     人體中的去氧核糖核酸(deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA)序列隱藏著重要的生物遺傳
資訊，它是由 A、C、T、G 四種鹼基所組成，鹼基對(base-pair)的排列順序是有意義
的，而這些有意義的訊息(Motif)在醫學上可幫助辨識血緣關係、研究遺傳疾病等。但
生物體中的鹼基對高達數億個，如何在眾多序列中找出一段重要且有意義的基因序列
便成為了一個重要的問題。本研究使用類神經網路(Artificial Neural Networks, ANNs)
中的增長式自我組織映射網路(Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map, GHSOM)的
模式將 DNA序列作群聚(cluster)，以物以類聚的概念將相類似的序列片段彼此聚集，

Abstract 
The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences have important hereditary information. It 
is composed by four different kinds of nucleotides (A, T, C, and G.). The permutation and 
combination of the DNA’s base-pair are significant. The significant information is called 
Motif, which can help experts to recognize the blood ties and hereditary disease in medicine. 
The Motif finding problem is to search the important fragment from the DNA sequences. 
These fragments are retained during the evolutionary process. There are more than hundred 
million base-pairs in the organism. Therefore, to find the important fragment becomes a 
difficult problem. This paper applies a growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) 
network to cluster the DNA sequences. It makes the similar fragment together and searches 
the specific fragment in the sequences. 
Keywords: DNA sequences, Self-organizing map networks, Motif finding problem 
 
 
二、 前言 
生物 DNA主要由 A、C、G、T 此 4種核苷酸鹼基所構成，這些核苷酸的排列組
合可以讓生物呈現多樣化的特徵表現。DNA定序技術是用來解讀生物體的 A、G、C、
T排列順序，如此便可以得知有關的生物資訊。當 DNA定序得到成功性的發展將有助
於基因認定 (Gene Identification)、基因調控 (Gene Regulation)、人類變異 (Human 
Variation)、染色體結構(Structure)分析、與疾病遺傳因素(Hereditary Factor)之探討。由
於 A、G、C、T 的組合種類過於龐大，使得即使運用電腦技術進行 DNA 定序時，仍
有著效率與效能的瓶頸。 
而基序(Motif)是指生物體當中有著重要功能的基因片段，在生物的演化過程中保
留了下來。而生物體中的鹼基對高達數億個，如何在眾多序列中找出一段重要且有意
義的基因序列便成為了一個重要的問題。若能在這些龐大的序列資料中，找到此段資
訊，生物學家就能應用 Motif 的訊息來尋找調控基因，甚至藉此來瞭解基因的功能及
分類相似的物種。 
 
三、 研究目的 
本研究的研究目的就是期望能夠在龐大的 DNA 序列當中，找尋出一小段片段，
使得它共通分數(consensus score)為最高，或是其相異程度最低。Motif Finding Problem
的問題定義：一個未知但長度固定為 l-mers 的 Motif 被植入不同的序列位置中，本研
究必須設法找出這個未知的Motif。問題的困難點在於，生物體上的Motif可能會發生
當大的落差，其結果可能並不是所要找尋的Motif，而真實的Motif卻被隱藏在龐大資
料中。 
挑戰者問題是指如何在 20條長度為 600的序列中是否能找出所植入長度 l =15的
Motif，內含突變又稱為雜訊，突變個數為 4的Motif出來，一般以(15 , 4)表示這個問
題。如果兩條序列之間突變的位置各不重疉，那就相當於在比對序列時，有 8 個不確
定的突變，剛好是序列長度的一半，代表著長度 15的序列有著一半的突變，這將會大
大地增加搜尋的複雜度，所以找出(15, 4) Motif是具有一定的難度，故一個演算法能否
順利解決挑戰者問題便具有指標性意義。 
 
五、 增長式自我組織映射網路(GHSOM) 
1. 自我組織映射網路(SOM) 
自我組織映射演算法是一種廣為人使用的演算法，其特色是能夠將高維度的資料
映射成一個二維的網路空間。這些二維的映射結果，資料相關性彼此呈現多個群聚，
讓使用者可以一目了然資料的某些群聚特性，如圖 2所示。 
 
SOM演算法一般的映射

透過距離的計算，能夠得到優
 使得權重與輸入向量越來越接
 
mi
網路的調整會隨著鄰近參數δ
 進行收斂。  
 
 
網路為矩形或六角形，而映射過程中，最常使用歐氏距離
x為輸入向量，mi為權重，公式如下： 
{ }||)()(||minarg)( tmtxtc i−=                      (1)

( )||||maxarg ie mmd −=                          (7) 
 
當找出單元 e與單元 d後，此網路會在兩者之間，插入新的單元行或列再重新訓練(如
圖 4)，使得此 SOM 的資料能夠獲得更多的網路空間進行映射。而其中新加入的網路單
元權重，則為自己鄰近區域的平均值。 
 
 
 
 
而控制是否加入新單元的參數是Γ1。藉由Γ1參數，能夠使得GHSOM網路架構是為高
度細粒型，或者是為高度階層型。較小的Γ1會導致細粒化；較大的Γ1則會階層化。此
停止準則的計算方式如下： 
 
|| ||i i
j C
QE m x
∈
= − j∑                           (8) 
 
1/m u
i u
iMQE n QE
∈
= ⋅∑                          (9) 
 
在一般情況下，各別網路將會由此控制停止與否： 
 
1m uMQE QE< Γ ⋅                           (10) 
 
 由於 GHSOM 同時使用了寬度式與深度式的成長，能夠讓其網路架構適合各種資料
類型，因此可以減輕 SOM 需事先定義網路大小的負擔。

 本研究主要分成三大步驟，首先必須對輸入的資料作前處理，才能進行 GHSOM
網路訓練。將所有的資料集進行切割與編碼轉換後，便將所有的片段輸入網路作訓練，
結束後會產生多個群集。最後，進行 profile分析，將所有比對出的片段分析計分，找

七、 實驗結果 
  本研究的資料來源是由MELINA系統的序列產生器所產生，共有 6組長度 100到
 600的資料，每組有 10個隨機資料。個別資料則為 Prvzner與 Sze所定義的挑戰者問 
 題，也就是 20條 DNA序列，並且植入(15, 4) – Motif。除了本研究所使用的 GHSOM 
 方法外，在此也使用MELINA系統中的MEME與 Gibbs Sampler演算法共三種模型，
 分別測試其對於 60筆序列資料的效能。本實驗是比對各演算法找出的Motif片段與資
  料中實際的Motif片段作相似度比對，實驗結果如表 2：

Gibbs 0.993  0.980 0.700 0.467 0.393 0.280  
表 2. 各演算法正確率 
 
 由實驗的數據中，可以發現本研究使用的 GHSOM方法在各序列長度正確率都優於傳
統的序列搜尋演算法MEME與 Gibbs Sampler。在此，也可以從另一個角度來觀察演 
算法對於長度不同時，效能的下滑曲線。如圖 8所示。即使是從演算法對於長度增加
時的效能下滑曲線，明顯的，GHSOM所下滑的幅度都遠小於MEME與 Gibbs Sampler
演算法。顯示出本研究使用的演算法即使在長度增加時，都能表現出不錯的正確性。

症分類是毫不相關的，所以在癌症分類之前必須先做基因選擇，進行基因選擇
可以減少資料量，以減少計算時間，因此它在癌症分類過程中扮演極重要的角
色。本研究使用基因演算法來選取基因，並分別與 t 統計法、權重投票法、資
訊增益法比較，且以決策樹建立分類器，檢視其在癌症與資料集的績效，實驗
結果發現，在這些不同特徵選取方法中，使用基因演算法能得到較高的正確率

3. 另外，在決策樹分類方法下，選擇基因建立節點時，會有許多基因的熵值
相同，無論在 InfoGain、GS、t 統計或 GA 選出來的基因都會有這個現象。
研究採取穩定排序法(stable sorting)，故基因在原資料中排序就前面優
先挑選。這個現象導致其他更高正確率的基因集合無法被建立成模型。基
因演算法因為採取隨機方式挑選，反而讓其他基因集合有機會成為模型的
一部份。最後，在決策樹下，基因演算法是一個較佳的方法，而且在所有
資料集中，正確率都表現最好。 
 
五、攜回資料名稱及內容 
附錄為本次會議所發表之文章與會議議程。 
 
  
2.1. Gene expression data 
 
A microarray experiment typically is used for 
comparing messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance in two 
different samples (e.g., treatment versus control). RNA 
from the treatment and control cells are extracted and 
labeled with two different fluorescent labels such as a 
red dye for the RNA from the treatment population and 
a green dye for that from the control population. Both 
extracts are washed over the microarray. Gene 
sequences from the extracts hybridize to their 
complementary sequence in the spots. To measure the 
relative abundance of the hybridized RNA the array is 
excited by a laser. If the RNA from the treatment 
population is in abundance, the spot will be red, if the 
RNA from the control population is in abundance, it 
will be green. If treatment and control bind equally, the 
spot will be yellow, while if neither binds, it will not 
fluoresce and appear black. Thus, from the 
fluorescence intensities and colors for each spot, the 
relative expression levels of the genes in the treatment 
and control populations can be estimated [3]. 
A gene expression data set from a microarray 
experiment can be represented by a real-valued 
expression matrix },mj,ni|w{M ij ≤≤≤≤= 11  
where the rows ( }g,,g{G n"1= ) from the expression 
patterns of genes, the columns ( }s,,s{S m"1= ) 
represent the expression profiles of samples, and each 
cell wij is the measured expression level of gene i in 
sample j. Therefore, M is defined as

2.2. Gene selection methods 
 
2.2.1. Genetic algorithms. The operation of GA starts 
with a set of solutions called population. Solutions 
from one population are taken and used to form a new 
population. This is motivated by a hope that the new 
population will be better than the old one. Solutions 
which are selected to form new solutions are selected 
according to their fitness - the more suitable they are, 
the more chances they have to reproduce [5].  
1. Chromosome encoding and fitness evaluating 
The chromosome is written as a vector with 
n×1 elements so that: 
]x,,x,x[xchromosome n"21=                 (2) 
where 1=ix , if the i
th gene is selected, or 0=ix , 
otherwise. After chromosomes have been created, each 
chromosome has a fitness value found by evaluating 
the fitness function [10]: 
 
))x(yensionalitdim(
)x(accuracy)x(fitness
−×
+×=

ω
ω
         (3) 
where accuracy(x) is the test accuracy of the classifier 
build with the gene subset represented by x, and 
dimensionality(x) is the dimension of the subset, 
21 ωω ,  are the weights of accuracy(x) and the gene 
number beyond x respectively. 
 
2. Selection 
Selection starts with choosing parents from the 
population, a process accomplished with a biased 
roulette wheel on which each chromosome in the 
population has a slot sized in proportion to its fitness 
value, defined as: 
N,j
)x(fitness
)x(fitness
P N
i
i
j
j ⋅⋅⋅== ∑
=
21
1
          (4) 
where N is the number of population. After a good 
paired chromosomes are selected, they exchange 
information by the crossover operation. 
 
3. Crossover 
This research uses the two-point gene exchange for 
crossover operation. The crossover rate is assumed to 
be Pcr. The crossover point is randomly designated by: 
.,i),n*random(ceili 21==θ                   (5) 
The next step is to complete the crossover with the 
rest of the genes based on the crossover point by 
exchanging genes with each other to generate the new 
offsprings. 
 
4. Mutation 
After a crossover operation is performed, mutation 
occurs.  In this study, individual genes of new 
offspring are changed randomly with probability Pmr. 
The mutation point is defined as 
).nrandom(ceil ×=δ                        (6) 
 
2.2.2. t-statistics. For two-class prediction, selection, 
and ranking of the genes can be based on the simple t-
statistics [12]

where ,x,N kk  and 
2
ks  is the size, mean, and variance, 
respectively, of class k, k = 1, 2. For each gene, a t-
(group) of samples is withheld, the other folds of 
samples are used to build a classifier to predicate the 
class of the withheld sample, and the accurate rate is 
calculated. Meanwhile the expression level of genes 
chosen by tGA for each dataset is shown for 
visualization reason. Finally, the Z-score analysis is 
presented to determine the significance of the observed 
frequency of an event against that which might have 
occurred by chance. This calculation normalizes the 
frequency with which each of the initial genes was 
selected in all predictors that classify the training and 
test data perfectly [9]. The Z-score can be calculated as 
following: 
σ
)S(ESZ ii −=                          (11) 
where Si is the number of times gene i is selected, E(Si) 
is the expected number of times gene i is selected, σ is 
the square root of the variance. Let A be the number of 
perfect predictors found in the experiment, Pi the 
probability of gene i being selected (if random). Then 
,AP)S(E ii ×=  and .A)P(P ii ×−×= 1σ  
 
3.1. Analysis of Colon data 
 
The Colon dataset consists of 62 expression 
measurements from colon biopsy samples reported by 
Alon et al. [2]. The expression profile has 2000 genes 
with 22 normal tissues and 40 tumor samples. The 
accuracy versus number of genes selected by different 
methods for Colon dataset is shown in Figure 1. The 
average accuracy of t-GA is 89.24% (with standard 
deviation 0.01), GA 88.80% (0.01), t-statistics 77.42% 
(0.03), InfoGain 77.26% (0.03), and GS 69.35% 
(0.05). The expression level of genes chosen by t-GA 
for Colon dataset is shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 
presents the Z-score based on normalizing the 
frequency with which each of the 2000 genes are 
selected in the 30 solutions where d is the predefined 
number of selected genes. The patterns of gene 
selection are similar for various choices of d. Therefore, 
the pattern of gene selection by t-GA is stable. For 
simplicity, only the results of the Colon data are shown 
here.

4. Conclusion 
 
The cDNA microarrays are novel biotechnologies 
increasingly used in cancer research. By allowing the 
monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands 
of genes simultaneously, microarray experiments may 
lead to a more complete understanding of the 
molecular variations among cancers. This has 
motivated the researches in proposing different cancer 
classification algorithms using the gene expression 
data. 
This paper proposes a t-GA for selecting a group of 
relevant genes from cancer microarray data. Then the 
decision tree based cancer classifier is built on top of 
these selected genes. Experimental results indicate that 
the cascade of t-statistics, GA and decision tree has the 
highest accuracy rate among different methods. The 
accuracy rate of this approach is also stable when the 
number of genes is changed. Moreover, some genes are 
consistently preferentially chosen in each dataset for 
various choices of d. It implies that the gene selection 
operation of t-GA is reproducible.
