retaining its merit of low complexity. Moreover, at the time of writing there was still no efficient
design of the Soft-In and Soft-Output (SISO) LR aided MIMO detector in the literature.
The goal of this project is to design an efficient LR aided MIMO detector based MMSE
and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), which is capable of generating the soft-outputs.
Furthermore, we will integrate this design into the SISO LR aided MIMO detector. The iteration
gain of the joint detection and decoding in the coded MIMO system will improve the performance
of the LR aided MIMO systems.
This project is motivated by the lack of the studies of the soft LR detector for MIMO systems
and their related iterative joint detection and decoding design. While the Sphere Decoding (SD)
[9], [10], a popular solution in the MIMO detection problems, still suffers from high complexity
and sensitive to Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) [11], the LR aided MIMO detector provides a lower
complexity-consumption solution without the dependency with the SNR. It will be valuable to
investigate and refine the design of the LR aided MIMO detection and consider the possible gain
by using the iterative joint detection and decoding techniques [12] while maintaining the complexity
as low as possible.
The Lattice-Reduction (LR) techniques developed for enhancing the performance of the signal
detection in MIMO systems were first introduced by Yao and Wornell in [4]. The basic idea
of the LR techniques was to transform the lattice basis into a short and fairly orthogonal one,
which was called the reduced basis [6]. By conducting the MIMO signal detection in the domain
of the transformed basis, due to the near-orthogonal property the received MIMO signals in the
transformed domain may have the reduced interference, where the interference was originated by
using multiple transmit antennas. Hence the performance of the MIMO signal detection can be
impressively improved, which has been demonstrated by [4], [5] and [6].
Along with Yao [4], Windpassinger [5] and Mow [6] are the pioneers of developing the low-
complexity LR aided MIMO detectors, where the LR techniques were employed in Zero-Forcing
(ZF) detector, Decision Feedback aided detector and V-BLAST detector. The MMSE based LR aided
MIMO detector was developed and investigated by Wu¨bben et al. [13]. The MMSE-SIC based LR
MIMO detector was also developed in [13], which had a better performance with higher complexity
compared to the MMSE based LR detector. The MMSE-SIC was further improved by Lee in [14]
when he took into account both the correlation and the non-zero mean effect of the transmitted
symbols due to the aid of LR, which had been assumed to be joint Gaussian distributed random
variables. However, the further complexity consumption was the disadvantage of the improved
MMSE-SIC in [15]. In conjunction with the Sphere Decoding (SD) [9], Ma et al. proposed an LR
aided MIMO detector with the stop-step detection algorithm [16]. More specifically, the LR aided
detection was employed in the first step of detection. If the estimate of the LR aided detection is
on the candidate list, the searching stops. Otherwise, the SD will carry on the search of the best
candidate.
Observed that there was a trade-off between the BER performance and the number of candidates
used to approximate the soft-outputs of the LR aided MMSE detector.

the total number of candidates in this case was 256.
V. SOFT-IN AND SOFT-OUTPUT (SISO) LR AIDED MIMO DETECTOR
By extending the work of [7], we have designed a soft-in and soft-output LR aided MIMO
detector, which is capable of providing the iteration gains in the coded MIMO system. The difference
between our work and [7] is that while the work of [7] shortened the candidate list layer by layer
in MIMO detection, our method was to keep the same number of the candidates in each MIMO
layer. The benefit of our method is that the imposed complexity can be reduced by keeping the best
candidates and developing the search tree. However, the question here is how to select the ”best
candidates” without visiting them all. In this report we adopting the K-best SD algorithm of [17]
in assisting us to develop the search tree. Observed that in Figure 3 upon increasing the number of
iterations the SISO LR aided MIMO detector had an improved BER performance but with a limit
iteration gain. When we further reduced the number of candidates in the proposed SISO LR-aided
MIMO detector, the iteration gain was vanished. In our investigation, we learned that the iteration
gain was limited because the ML estimated candidate was not one of the candidates in the reduced
candidate list with high probability, which greatly diminished the accuracy of the soft-information
approximation of the LR-aided MIMO detector. Hence, the errors propagated in the iteration loops
and may result in an even worse performance. This motivates us in developing our next project.
