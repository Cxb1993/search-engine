alloy was solution heat treated at 1050℃ for 
5 minutes and then quenched in water. The 
chemical composition of the base metal is 
summarized in Table 1. The alloy plates were 
machined into welding specimens of 
dimensions 80×80×3 mm. 
 2
   Welding was performed using a 2.5 kW 
Nd-YAG laser system (Rofin-Sinar CW025), 
operating at a mean power of 1.5 kW and 
using a rectangular output power waveform. 
By gradually reducing the value of ΔP (ΔP = 
Pp–Pb, where Pp is the peak power and Pb the 
base power), the output power mode was 
changed progressively from a pulsed wave 
(PW) to a continuous wave (CW). As shown 
in Fig. 1, four different power modes were 
employed, namely PW1 (ΔP = 2234W), PW2 
(ΔP = 1572W), PW3 (ΔP = 858W), and CW 
(ΔP = 0W). The corresponding peak to base 
power ratios, Pp/Pb, reduced from an initial 
value of 6.8 to a final value of 1. The 
frequency and duty of the rectangular 
modulated beam were maintained at 100 Hz 
and 50 %, respectively. The laser beam was 
transferred to the workstation via an optical 
fiber of diameter 600 µm. The focal length for 
welding was 120 mm, corresponding to a spot 
size of 600 μm on the upper surface of the 
welding specimen. Figure 2 presents a 
schematic illustration of the laser welding 
process. A constant welding speed of 1500 
mm/min was used throughout the welding 
trials. Three different shielding gases, namely 
Ar, He and N2, were used to provide face 
shielding. The shielding gas nozzle had a 
diameter of 4 mm and was arranged at an 
angle of 25° to the workpiece. The shielding 
gas was delivered with flow rates of 10 L 
min-1, 16 L min-1 and 22 L min-1, respectively. 
To prevent the risk of back reflection, with the 
associated risk of accidental damage to the 
optics, the laser beam was orientated at a 
forward angle of 10° relative to an imaginary 
line normal to the workpiece surface. A 
high-speed video camera system with a frame 
acquisition rate of 1000 frames per second 
was utilized to observe the laser plume 
behavior under different welding conditions.  
In calculating the D/W ratio, D is the 
actual penetration depth of the weld and W is 
the average width of the weld in the region of 
the fusion zone (FZ) extending from 0.2 mm 
below the cap to 0.2 mm above the root. 
Meanwhile, the percentage of porosity, Pr, in 
the weld is evaluated as , 
where  is the total area of porosity and 
 is the weld area. The porosity 
measurements were conducted by using an 
image inspection system to examine CCD 
digital images of three longitudinal 
metallographic sections (length = 10 mm) 
extracted from parallel positions of the weld 
located 0.2 mm to the left of the FZ centre, in 
the centre of the FZ, and 0.2 mm to the right 
of the FZ, respectively.

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Weld morphology 
    Figure 3 shows the surface morphologies 
and cross-sectional photos of weld beads 
produced under various values of ΔP using 
different shielding gases and flow rates. It is 
observed that in every case, the weld becomes 
rougher and the weld spatter effect more 
pronounced as ΔP increases.  
A higher ΔP causes a more abrupt 
pressure change in the weld pool as a result of 
the more pronounced periodic pulse effect of 
the output power.8,10,19) The enhanced pulse 
effect increases the agitation of the molten 
pool and causes the keyhole to become 
unstable and to collapse.20) Therefore, the 
surface of the weld becomes increasingly 
rough as ΔP increases. Spatter is generally the 
result of molten metal being carried by the 
evaporating metal as it is ejected from the 
keyhole of the weld pool. As ΔP increases, the 
energy input to the workpiece during the Pp 
stage increases. This promotes the evaporation 
of metal from the bottom tip of the keyhole,17) 
and hence results in a greater degree of weld 
spatter. It has also been reported that the 
degree of spattering is directly related to the 
viscosity of the molten metal.21) It is thought 
that spattering is affected by the flow of the 
vaporized metal from the keyhole and by the 
surface tension gradient forces of the molten 
metal, which in turn depend on the 
characteristics of the alloying elements (e.g. 
 4
lesser influence on the penetration depth. 
Consequently, the penetration depths 
identified in the present study are very similar 
despite the fact that the plumes formed under 
the three shielding gases are quite different in 
size (Fig.4). A study by Takano et al.8)  into 
the dissimilar lap welding of Inconel 690 with 
Inconel 600 using a Nd:YAG laser yielded 
similar findings. Their results indicated that 
the frequency of the Nd:YAG laser beam is 
higher than that of the laser plume, with the 
result that the Nd:YAG laser energy is not 
absorbed in the laser plume. 
In essence, a pulsed welding process is 
similar to a drilling process since each pulse 
makes its own keyhole. A high value of ΔP is 
associated with a high peak power Pp (high 
pulse level). Therefore, the laser beam 
concentrates more energy on the workpiece 
during the Pp stage and produces an increased 
penetration depth as a result. Additionally, a 
higher value of ΔP causes a greater agitation 
of the molten pool due to the enhanced 
periodic pulse effect and increases the 
evaporation of metal from the bottom tip of 
the keyhole.17) Both effects increase the 
fluidity of the molten metal and the transition 
of thermal energy and therefore increase the 
penetration depth. 
 Figure 7 illustrates the relationship 
between the D/W ratio and ΔP for various 
flow rates and shielding gases. The D/W ratio 
increases with increasing ΔP because a higher 
value of ΔP increases the penetration depth 
under the same average power. The results of 
Fig. 7 indicate that the shielding gas and flow 
rate have no significant effect on the D/W 
ratio. 
 
3.4. Analysis of porosity formation 
Figure 8 presents a series of photographs 
of longitudinal sections of the various welds 
extracted from the vicinity of the weld centers. 
It can be seen that the porosity of the weld 
varies with the shielding gas. Specifically, Ar 
shielding results in the highest weld porosity, 
and N2 the lowest. Furthermore, as shown in 
Fig. 9, Pr decreases with increasing ΔP under 
Ar or He shielding, i.e. from 5.5％ (CW) to 
2.5％ (PW1) and from 3％ (CW) to 1.5％ 
(PW1), respectively. However, under N2 
shielding, the variation in porosity is very 
slight, i.e. 0.1～0.6％. 
Some or all of the bubbles in the weld 
pool, mainly metallic vapour and shielding 
gas and sometimes entranced air, are trapped 
by the instability and collapse of the keyhole 
during welding, causing porosity in the 
finished weld.14,30-31) The content of the 
trapped bubbles depends on the nature of the 
shielding gas (e.g. the type of shielding 
gas),14,18) the shielding conditions,16,32-34) the 
vapour pressure of the metal,35-36) the viscosity 
of the molten metal21) and the dynamics of the 
keyhole during the welding process.10,37) The 
floatability of the bubbles is affected by the 
characteristics of the output power (e.g. the 
power waveform),38) the surface tension of the 
molten pool,8) and the direction of the molten 
metal flow (Marangoni flow).35,39-40) 
Therefore, the content of the weld porosity 
depends on the factors which trap the bubbles 
and enhance the bubble floatability. 
Regarding the effects of the shielding gas 
on the porosity ratio, Pr, the effect of gas 
plasma pressure on the keyhole need not be 
considered because gas plasma is not 
generated under any of the three shielding 
gases used in the current Nd-YAG laser 
welding process. This is in direct contrast to 
the phenomenon observed in CO2 laser 
welding. In Nd:YAG laser welding, under an 
identical mean power and power wave form, 
the amount of the vaporized materials and 
excited hot gas in the keyhole is similar under 
the different shielding gases. Therefore, the 
level of porosity under different shielding 
gases is related to the amount of shielding gas 
blown into the keyhole and the suppression 
effect by the shielding gas of the vaporized 
materials ejected from the keyhole. The higher 
the density of the shielding gas, and the higher 
its momentum, the greater the amount of 
shielding gas and vaporized materials trapped 
within the keyhole. The increased amount of 
shielding gas and vaporized materials at the 
solidifying front results in a higher porosity. 
The density of the He shielding gas is 
comparatively low. Consequently, the amount 
of shielding gas and vaporized materials 
trapped within the keyhole is less than that in 
Ar shielding and hence the porosity of the 
weld is reduced. The porosity of the weld 
 6
effect. However, the degree of surface 
roughness and weld spattering independs 
on the type of shielding gas employed in 
the welding process and their flow rates. 
2. A very small plume volume is generated 
during the Pb stage. During the Pp stage, the 
maximum plume volume is produced by 
the Ar shielding gas, while the minimum 
volume is produced by the He gas. The 
plume volume reduces slightly as ΔP 
decreases. At high flow rates, the 
blow-away tendency of the plume is 
obvious with Ar shielding gas, but is less 
apparent with N2. The plume has no blow 
away tendency under He shielding. 
3. As ΔP increases, more energy is 
concentrated on the workpiece during the 
Pp stage and hence the effect of the periodic 
agitation increases to enhance the weld 
convention and results in a greater 
penetration depth. Accordingly, the D/W 
ratio becomes larger as ΔP increases. 
However, the shielding gas type and flow 
rate have no apparent influence on the 
penetration depth. 
4. The specimens welded under Ar shielding 
have the greatest porosity, while those 
welded under N2 have the least. As ΔP 
increases, Pr decreases from 5.5％ to 2.5％ 
and from 3％ to 1.5％ under Ar and He 
shielding, respectively. For a lower Pr, the 
reduction provided by He shielding is less 
than that provided by Ar shielding. Under 
N2 shielding, Pr lies between 0.1 and 0.6％. 
For welds with low porosity, increasing the 
level of ΔP provides only a marginal 
reduction in porosity. 
5. For He shielding at flow rates between 10 
and 22 l/min, the porosity reduces as the 
shielding gas flow rate increases. The low 
density of He provides a poor protection of 
the weld pool at low flow rates and hence 
the resultant welds exhibit significant 
porosity. For the high-density gases of Ar 
and N2, the flow rates considered in this 
study have no significant effect on the 
porosity.
