important one is the optical reflectivity of the
surface. The CFPI works reasonably well for high
reflective surface but for optically diffusive
biological subjects there may be a problem. This
may be improved by more sensitive photodetector,
optical lens etc,. or by attatching a reflective
surface to the tissue. However, the superior high
frequency response is very promising for high
frequency ultrasonic imaging application.
