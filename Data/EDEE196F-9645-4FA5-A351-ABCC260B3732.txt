Abstract 
Lithography technologies for making future ULSI circuits plays one of vital roles in determining 
the development direction of semiconductor industries. The demand of ever-smaller CD in 
lithography is steady and continual. Besides playing important role in nanoelectronics, 
lithography and nanofabrication is also a key technology in the fields of the nanophotonics and 
biochemical technology. The next-generation lithography (NGL) alternatives are all candidates at 
and below 32 nm. Of the possible NGL technologies, Maskless electron beam lithography is an 
attractive candidate and a potential successor to optical lithography. In this study, an E-beam 
simulation program based on Monte Carlo method was developed to study the electron scattering 
in electron beam lithography. 
 
 
Simulation 
There are various models of Monte Carlo simulation for electron interactions, including multiple 
scattering model, single scattering model, hybrid model, direct simulation model and dielectric 
function model [1].  
 
The simulation program was implemented with VC++ and run in Pentium-4 personal computer. 
The random numbers files were downloaded from random organization [2] instead of pseudo 
random numbers to get adequate randomness. Several thousands random numbers were served 
for one incident electron of 40 KeV. 
 
Density calculation 
The density of the photoresist is necessary for the simulation of electron bombardment. We used 
electronic balance, AG285, to measure masses of 3 pieces of 6 inches wafers before coating. 
Then measure the same 3 wafers after spin coating with NEB-A4 photoresist.  
The photoresist thickness was measured at n&k tool, NKT-1500. The edge bead removal 
width of spin coating is 2 mm. The cover area per wafer can be calculated. The density of the 
coated photoresist can be obtained by following equation as

where d is the density of the photoresist film to be calculated, A is the calculated photoresist 
covered area of one coated wafer, t is the averaged measured thickness of the photoresist film, 
Mafter and Mbefore are the measured masses of the wafers after and before spin-coating 
respectively. 
 
Components analysis 
It is important to know the composition of the photoresist film before simulation. ESCA (electron 
spectroscopy for chemical analysis) was used to analyze the photoresist film components. ESCA 
can’t analyze hydrogen. So we used EA (Elemental Analyzer) for hydrogen ratio analysis. The 
ESCA result is shown at Fig. 1 and Table 1. The EA result is shown at Table 2.

The scattering angle could be obtained from this equation. 
 
Azimuthal angle random number R4  
The azimuthal angle Φ is equally spanned between 0 and 2π. It can be easily obtained from 
random number as [3] 
 42 RπΦ =  (8) 
 
Trajectory of scattering 
As mean free path, ith species scattering center, θ and Φ are decided, one can calculate the next 
position and direction of the impinged electron. And the electron will lose kinetic energy during 
the path. It will repeat and repeat until the electron lost enough energy to reach cut off energy [3]. 
One step of the electron trajectory is shown at Fig. 2.

Verification 
To verify correctness of the simulation program, comparison of stopping power, penetration ratio, 
reflection ratio and energy profile will be done. PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate, C5H8O2) film 
on silicon substrate was mostly frequently used for simulation, test, and comparison. For energy 
profile, PMMA film on blank mask plate was used for simulation and comparison. 
 
Stopping power 
The incident energized electron will lose power when inelastic interaction occurs during the 
bombardment process. Continuous slowing down approximation formula is used to calculate the 
lost power. Stopping power is the lost power per unit length of the incident electron. It depends 
on the electron energy and the film that the electron traveling. 
 
Stopping power of the films could be verified by the stopping range, Bethe electron range, of the

Energy profile 
Finally, constant energy contour was checked for the verification. In this test, 500 nm of PMMA 
resist film on 0.08 µm Cr film on a thick bulk SiO2 substrate was used for simulation. 500 nm 
isolated line pattern were used. The incident electron energy for the test is 20 KeV and the dosage 
is 80 uC/cm2. The patterns are simulated in terms of Gaussian sources at a density of 8 lines/µm 
(s=0.125 µm) and with a standard deviation σ=0.05 µm. This density was chosen that a 0.5 µm 
line would contain four beam positions. The constant energy contours of reference paper are dash 
lines shown at Fig. 3. Due to symmetry to the line center, only the right half energy profile of the 
line is shown [5]. Constant energy contours of same energy of our developed program were 
shown at Fig. 4.

beam with 50nm range, at 20 KeV [5].

Three contours of constant energy, 1200, 800 and 325 J/cm3, were compared between the 
reference paper and our simulation program. In Fig. 4, the brighter region indicates higher energy 
 Proximity effect parameters of Monte Carlo method 
The proximity effect parameters, the reflection ratios and penetration ratios derived from the 
Monte Carlo method are listed at Table 6. The forward scattering range is small compared to 
experiment fitting method. The backscattering ranges of the first 3 films are almost the same due 
to similar film averaged atoms mass and similar averaged atom number. 
 
For same incident electron energy, the total cross section of an atom is nearly proportional to Z4/3, 
where Z is the atomic number of scattering target. So the total cross section of Ta is the largest 
and the mean free path is the shortest. The backscattering range for Ta film is the smallest and the 
energy reflection ratio is the largest due to the largest atom number and the highest weight 
density.
