resolution and the widest measurement range 
from -10 to +10 Volts. Total number of channels 
is 16, which allowed to record data 
simultaneously from all pressure transducers. The 
test conditions are recorded by the NEFF system. 
 
 
2.2 Test Models and Instrumentation 
The sketch of test model is presented in Fig. 1. It 
consists of a single-foot support, a flat plate and 
an instrumentation plate with a rectangular cavity. 
Experiments were conducted for two different test 
configurations which are presented in Table 2. 
The Kulite pressure transducers were used for the 
surface pressure measurements. The outside 
diameter of the pressure transducers is 2.36 mm, 
and the pressure-sensitive area is 0.97 mm in 
diameter. The natural frequency of transducers as 
quoted by manufacturer is 200 kHz. In order to 
minimize interference with the flow, sensors are 
flush-mounted. For each cavity model, there was one 
pressure transducer far upstream the cavity on a flat 
plate  ( 0.75x L = −  for cavity 1, 0.45x L = −  for 
cavity 2), one transducer just downstream the trailing 
edge, and a few sensors along the cavity floor. 
The boundary layer thickness upstream of the 
cavity was estimated by Bies’s empirical 
equation11 incoming boundary layer thickness can 
be calculated, which is shown in Table 3.

Data acquisition at each test configuration 
was performed with different settings, in 
which the sampling rate for test 
configuration 1 (256 k data points) is 500 
kHz while 250 kHz is for test configuration 2 
(128 k data points). Thus the frequency 
resolution of Fourier spectra is about 0.5 Hz. 
3. Results and Discussion 
Fourier transform is the most commonly used for 
frequency analysis. But this transform loses all the 
information about phase of certain frequency 
component at different time moments. Therefore 
this technique actually is inappropriate for 
unsteady signal analysis. Further, the mode-
switching phenomenon flow over shallow cavity 
is essentially unsteady. Thus joint time-frequency 
techniques were employed in this investigation, 
which includes Wavelet and Hilbert-Huang 
transforms. Cattafesta et al. [12] indicated number 
of dominant mode does not remain the same all 
the time but changes randomly. This implies there 
is a competition between different modes for 
available energy. 
3.1 Fourier analysis 
From experiments with a long flat plate upstream 
the cavity (test configuration 1), resonance was 
not observed and Rossiter modes were not 
determined. Resonances were found in case of test 
configuration 2 at Mach numbers 0.5 and 0.6. 
Fourier spectra of pressure data near the trailing 
edge are presented in Fig. 2 for the two resonant 
cases. Both spectra indicate that only second 
Rossiter mode has very high intensity. At M = 0.5, 
the frequency of second mode is equal to 2,600 
Hz while two peaks (2,899 Hz and 4,620 Hz) are 
distinguishable in all spectra at M = 0.6. 
Comparing the experimental data with the values 
listed in Table 1, the discrepancy is about 10-14 
%. However, the data agree with the results of 
Ahuja and Mendoza [8] reasonably well. 
Furthermore, looking through all spectra obtained 
inside the cavity it can be seen that amplitude of 
Rossiter modes is higher at positions closer to rear 
wall. It again confirms that origin of acoustic 
disturbances is located near the trailing edge. 
3.2    Wavelet Analysis 
Example of wavelet spectrum corresponding to 
resonant case at M = 0.6 is presented in Fig. 3. X-
axis in wavelet spectra is time, and Y-axis is 
frequency. The gray scale represents normalized 
wavelet coefficients. Time range in the plot is 
from 0.01s to 0.52s. Frequency ranges in wavelet 
spectra were chosen in such a way in order to 
cover the three first Rossiter modes.  
In the presented wavelet spectrum, there is very 
evident line at frequency corresponding to second 
Rossiter mode. In contrast to Fourier spectra, 
intermittent behavior here can be easily observed. 
But since the first and third Rossiter modes are 
much weaker than second mode switching doesn’t 
take place. Thus only “switching-on” or 
“switching-off” of the second mode is addressed. 
Presented representation of wavelet data provides 
mostly qualitative picture whereas some 
quantitative analysis is also required. Making a 
slice of a wavelet spectrum along X-axis we can 
get distribution of instantaneous amplitude at 
particular frequency. It is obvious that small 
amplitudes correspond to noise signal and it is 
now necessary to determine threshold value to 
separate noise and Rossiter oscillations.  
From Fourier spectra, it is evident that there is 
white noise in signal which usually has a normal 
distribution. This fact is also proved by skewness 
plate. Therefore the coupling between Rossiter 
mode and longitudinal and/or transversal mode in 
the cavity may cause such strong total level of 
oscillations. 
 
4. Conclusions 
This investigation was conducted in order to study 
unsteady behavior of flow over shallow cavity. 
Pressure data were analyzed with wavelet and 
Hilbert-Huang transforms. It was found strong 
oscillations still occur at some conditions even if 
flow parameters do not satisfy resonance criterion 
( 0.066L
δ < ). In both test configurations, the 
second Rossiter mode is dominant. Those 
oscillations were as stronger as δ/L is near to the 
critical value. 
With wavelet transformation, it indicated high-
intensity oscillations exist in the flow at 
frequencies corresponding to Rossiter modes. But 
because flow conditions do not satisfy resonance 
criterion, they vanish very soon after they appear. 
Thus, transition of flow into resonant state is 
going through increasing of duration of single 
appearance of fluctuations at frequency of the 
Rossiter modes. Flow was found to be in resonant 
state when total duration of single mode extends 
about 15 % of total experiment time. Finally, 
number of dominant mode can be found by 
searching for characteristic length scales in the 
system. However, which Rossiter mode would be 
dominant in shallow cavity flow is still open.
