where the melanogenesis-related enzymes, including 
tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 (TRP1 
and TRP2) are up-regulated. Hence, agents blocking the 
signal pathway would also exhibit depigmentation against 
melanocytes (Solano et al., 2006; Ando et al., 2007; Zhu 
and Gao, 2008; Chang and Chen, in press; Chang and 
Lin, 2010). 
In the present study, we screened more than 200 crude 
extracts of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs to identify 
their applicability as skin-lightening agents. The Magnolia 
officinalis extract (MOE) was found to have strong 
inhibitory activity on melanogenesis in both mouse B16 
melanoma cells and zebrafish. The inhibitory effect of 
MOE on melanogenesis was investigated in both B16 
cells and zebrafish. 
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Preparation of MOE 
 
“Houpo”, M. officinalis Rehd. et Wils., was supplied from Kwong-Te 
Company, Kaohsiung, Taiwan and was identified by professor H. C. 
Lin of National Defense Medicine Center. The dried powder of the 
bark (20.0 Kg) was extracted with 95% (v/v) ethanol at room 
temperature overnight four times followed by filtration. The flow-
through was concentrated in vacuo to yield dark-brown syrup (2.85 
Kg).  
 
 
Chemicals and antibodies 
 
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), 
arbutin, Triton X-100, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), L-dopa, 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), trypsin/EDTA, synthetic melanin, 1-
phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU), IBMX, and α-MSH were purchased from 
Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Anti-tyrosinase 
antibodies (#62914) and protease inhibitor cocktail were obtained 
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Anti--actin antibodies 
(#3662) were purchased from Bio Vision Inc. (Irvine, CA, USA). All 
other chemicals were obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. 
(Tokyo, Japan) and were of analytic reagent grade.  
 
 
Cell cultures and drug treatments 
 
Mouse B16 melanoma cells (4A5) were obtained from the 
Bioresources Collection and Research Center (BCRC, Food 
Industry Research and Development Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan, 
ROC). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s 
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum 
at 37°C in a humidified, CO2-controlled (5%) incubator. The cells 
were seeded at an appropriate cell density in a 24-well or a 6-well 
plate. After 1 d of incubation, the cells were treated with various 
concentrations of the drugs in the absence or presence of a 
stimulation agent (10 nM of α-MSH or 100 µM of IBMX) for another 
8 h (qRT-PCR), 16 h (tyrosinase activity assay and western blot), 
48 h (melanin determination). Thereafter, the cells were harvested 
and used for various assays. 
 
 
Measurements of cell viability 
 
MTT assay was performed to examine the viability of cells. After the 
 
 
 
 
cells were incubated with the samples for 48 h, the culture medium 
was removed and replaced with 1 mg/ml MTT solution dissolved in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for an additional 2 
h. The MTT solution was then removed and DMSO was added, 
following which the absorbance of the dissolved formazan crystals 
was determined at 570 nm by a spectrophotometer. 
 
 
Determination of melanin content 
 
At the end of cell cultivation, the cells were harvested and washed 
twice with PBS. The pelleted cells were homogenized in lysis buffer 
containging 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 1% Triton X-
100 at 4°C with 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. After 
centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, the melanin pellets were 
dissolved in 1 N NaOH containing 20% DMSO for 1 h at 95°C. The 
absorbance at 490 nm was measured, and the melanin content was 
measured using the authentic standard of synthetic melanin. The 
protein content in the supernatant was determined using a Bradford 
assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the protein standard. 
The specific melanin content was adjusted by the amount of protein 
in the same reaction. 
 
 
Measurements of cellular tyrosinase activity 
 
To determine the tyrosinase activity in the crude extract, a source of 
crude cellular tyrosinase was obtained by homogenizing drug-
treated or untreated cells in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1% 
Triton X-100, and 1 mM PMSF at 4°C with 30 repeated strokes in a 
Dounce homogenizer. Detergent was used to release the 
membrane-bound tyrosinase from the melanosomes. The lysates 
were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to obtain the supernatant 
as the source of crude cellular tyrosinase. The protein content in the 
supernatant was determined using a Bradford assay with BSA as 
the protein standard. Tyrosinase activity was then determined as 
follows: 1 ml of the reaction mixture contained 50 mM of phosphate 
buffer (pH 6.8), 2.5 mM of L-dopa, and 500 µg of the supernatant 
protein, and was incubated at 37°C for 15 min, following which the 
dopachrome formation was monitored by measuring absorbance at 
a wavelength of 475 nm. One unit of tyrosinase activity is defined 
as the total enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 µ mole of 
dopachrome in 1 min. The amount of dopachrome in the reaction 
was calculated using the Lambert-Beer Law while the molar 
extinction coefficient of dopachrome is 3600 M-1·cm-1 (Neeley et al., 
2009). The specific tyrosinase activity was normalized with protein 
content in the reaction.  
 
 
Measurements of cell-free tyrosinase activity 
 
The crude enzyme source of solubilized tyrosinase was prepared 
as described above, with the exception that untreated cells were 
used in this measurement. To determine the inhibitory effect of 
MOE toward cell-free tyrosinase activity, the reaction mixture 
contained 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 2.5 mM of L-dopa, the 
tested concentration of the drug, and 500 µg of the supernatant 
protein with a total volume of 1 ml of crude tyrosinase. After 
incubation at 37°C for 15 min, dopachrome formation was 
monitored by measuring the absorbance at 475 nm. The relative 
tyrosinase activity was obtained by dividing the enzyme activity of 
the reaction mixture containing a drug by that without drugs.  
 
 
Western blot analysis 
 
The cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in cold 
lysis buffer (20 mM sodium  phosphate  (pH 6.8),  1%  Triton X-100,

Figure 2. Effect of MOE on melanogenesis in B16 cells. The cells were cultivated for 1 d and 
then stimulated with 10 nM of α-MSH (A and B) or 100 µM of IBMX (B) for 2 d in the absence 
or presence of 6.25 µg/ml MOE. The melanin and protein contents of cells were determined 
using spectrometry, as described in the Experimental section, and the specific melanin 
content of each reaction was calculated by dividing the melanin content by the protein 
content in the same reaction.  
 
 
 
determined. The results are shown in Figure 2. The 
melanin content of B16 cells increased considerably after 
stimulation by α-MSH. Thereafter, MOE treatment 
resulted in significant decrease in the melanin content of 
α-MSH-stimulated B16 cells, and 12.5 µg/ml MOE-
treated cells contained similar level of the melanin as that 
in non-α-MSH-stimulated cells (Figure 2A). In addition, 
the melanogenic inhibition of MOE showed a dose-
dependent manner with an IC50 value of 9.3 µg/ml.  When 
the inhibitory potency of MOE and arbutin were 
compared, MOE exhibited more than 8-fold stronger 
activity than that of arbutin. In addition to α-MSH, we 
used another stimulating agent IBMX, which is an 
intracellular cAMP elevation agent, to stimulate B16 cells 
and found that MOE also inhibited melanogenesis in the 
IBMX-stimulated cells (Figure 2B). 
Because tyrosinase plays an important role in 
melanogenesis,  we  determined  the   effect  of  MOE  on

more detail, we conducted western blotting and qRT-PCR 
to verify levels of tyrosinase protein and its mRNA in the 
MOE-treated cells. The result is shown in Figure 4. After 
stimulation by α-MSH, both tyrosinase protein (Figure 4A 
and B) and its mRNA (Figure 4C) were significantly 
increased.  However,  the  increased  level  of  tyrosinase 
protein was significantly reduced by the treatment of 12.5 
µg/ml MOE (Figure 4A and B). In contrast, the stimulated 
tyrosinase mRNA in the α-MSH-stimulated cells was not 
reduced by the MOE treatment (Figure 4C). These results 
demonstrated that MOE inhibits melanogenesis of B16 
cells  by a pre-translational regulation on tyrosinase gene

In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrated that MOE 
is an effectively melanogenesis inhibitor, which functions 
by a pre-translational regulation on tyrosinase gene 
expression. In addition, MOE also exhibited depigmenting 
activity in an in vivo evaluation system. These results 
indicated that MOE may be useful in the treatment of skin 
hyperpigmenting.

4become an esthetic problem. Therefore, several studies have focused on the inhibition of1
tyrosinase activity and the prevention of abnormal pigmentation (2-3).2
A previous study has reported that some cytokines and growth factors play3
importantly regulatory roles in melanogenesis (4). -Melanocyte stimulating hormone4
(-MSH) is the most well-studied hormone. This hormone binds to its receptor,5
melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R), on the membrane of melanocytes and stimulates6
melanogenesis via the GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)-cAMP-MITF7
(microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) pathway where the8
melanogenesis-related enzymes, including tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related proteins 19
and 2 (TRP1 and TRP2) are upregulated. In addition to-MSH, other intracellular cAMP10
elevation agent such as forskolin or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin (IBMX) also stimulates11
melanogenesis through the same signal pathway as that of -MSH. Accordingly, agents12
blocking the signal pathway would exhibit depigmentation against melanocytes (5-6).13
In the present study, we screened more than 200 crude extracts of traditional14
Chinese medicinal herbs to identify their applicability as skin-lightening agents. The P.15
acidula extract (PAE) was found to have strong inhibitory activity on melanogenesis in16
mouse B16 melanoma cells. The inhibitory effect of the extract on melanogenesis of the17
cells was investigated in advance.18

additional 2 h. The MTT solution was then removed and DMSO was added, following6
which the absorbance of the dissolved formazan crystals was determined at 570 nm by a7

Determination of melanin content10
11
At the end of cell cultivation, the cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS.12
The pelleted cells were homogenized in lysis buffer containging 20 mM sodium13
phosphate (pH 6.8) and 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C with 30 strokes in a Dounce14
homogenizer. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, the melanin pellets were15
dissolved in 1 N NaOH containing 20% DMSO for 1 h at 95 °C. The absorbance at 49016
nm was measured, and the melanin content was measured using the authentic standard of17
synthetic melanin.18
19
Measurements of cellular tyrosinase activity20
21
To determine the tyrosinase activity in the crude extract, a source of crude cellular22
tyrosinase was obtained by homogenizing drug-treated or untreated cells in 20 mM23
sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM PMSF at 4 °C with 30 repeated24
strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Detergent was used to release the membrane-bound25
tyrosinase from the melanosomes. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min26
81
Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)2
were performed on the ABI 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster3
City, CA, U.S.A.) using Fast SYBR® Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).Total4
RNA was extracted using an RNeasy® mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) according to the5
manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the total RNA sample was evaluated by 6
determining the OD260/OD280 ratio. To prepare a cDNA pool from each RNA sample,7
total RNA (2g) was reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 90 min in the presence of oligo(dT)8
primers (MD Bio. Co., Taipei, Taiwan) and reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular9
Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The oligonucleotides primers for mouse tyrosinase10
(forward, 5′-GGCCAGCTTTCAGGCAGAGGT-3′; reverse,11
5′-TGGTGCTTCATGGGCAAAATC-3′) and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate12
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal control (forward,13
5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′)14
were used. After the initial incubation of 2 min at 50 °C, the cDNA was denatured at 9515
°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of PCR (95 °C, 15 s, 60 °C, 60 s). All results were16
obtained from at least three independent experiments. The mRNA level of tyrosinase was17
normalized using GAPDH as an internal control.18

Statistical analysis21
22
All the data in the present study were obtained as averages of experiments that were23
performed in triplicate and are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was24
performed by the Student’s t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically25
significant.26

cellular tyrosinase. We measured the enzyme activity by using L-dopa as an enzyme1
substrate. The result is shown in Fig. 3. The cellular tyrosinase activity was significantly2
increased after stimulation by IBMX, while PAE treatments would significantly inhibit3
the stimulated cellular tyrosinase activity. Hence, the result suggested that PAE reduced4
melanogenesis of IBMX-stimulated B16 cells via down-regulated cellular tyrosinase5
activity.6

Effect of PAE on tyrosinase protein and its mRNA levels in B16 cells8
9
To study the inhibitory effect of PAE on melanogenesis more detail, we conducted10
western blot and qRT-PCR to verify levels of tyrosinase protein and its mRNA in the11
PAE-treated cells. The results are shown in Fig. 4 (western blot) and Fig. 5 (qRT-PCR).12
After stimulation by IBMX, both tyrosinase protein (Fig. 4) and its mRNA (Fig. 5) were13
significantly increased. Moreover, the increased levels of both tyrosinase protein and its14
mRNA in the IBMX-stimulated cells were downregulated by PAE treatments. These15
results reasonably explain the previous finding where both cellular tyrosinase activity16
(Fig. 3) and melanin content (Fig. 2) were decreased in the PAE-treated cells due to the17
inhibitory effect on tyrosinase gene expression by the extract in the IBMX-stimulated18
mouse melanoma B16 cells.19
In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrated that PAE is an effectively20
melanogenesis inhibitor, which functions via down-regulation of tyrosinase expression.21
These results indicated that PAE may be useful in the treatment of skin hyperpigmenting.22
