interactions to protein stability has been revealed by site directed
mutagenesis experiments (Itzhaki et al., 1995; Matthews, 1995;
Shortle et al., 1990; Yutani et al., 1987). On the other hand, free-
energy calculations on protein mutants have been carried out to
understand/predict the contributions from different interactions and
the stability change of proteins upon mutation (Bash et al., 1987;
Guerois et al., 2002; Tidor and Karplus, 1991). These free-energy
calculations require the 3D structure of a protein and extensive
computations. As the gap between known amino acid sequences and
3D structures is exponentially increasing it is necessary to develop
methods for predicting mutant protein stability from sequence.
Montanucci et al. (2008) addressed this problem and developed a
support vector machines based method to predict whether a set of
mutations can enhance the stability of a given protein. However,
this method mainly focused on multiple mutants and two-state
predictions. All other sequence based methods predict the stability
change of a protein only upon point mutation.
Hence, it is necessary to develop a reliable method for
discriminating the stabilizing and destabilizing mutants as well as
predicting the stability change of proteins upon double mutations. In
this work, we have systematically analyzed the stability of double
mutants available in ProTherm database and developed a weighted
decision table method (WET) for predicting the stability changes
of 180 double mutants obtained from thermal (G) denaturation.
The method is mainly based on the information on wild-type residue,
mutant residue and three neighboring residues on both sides of the
mutant residues for the two sites. Using 10-fold cross-validation
test, our method showed a correlation of 0.75 between experimental
and predicted values of stability changes, and an accuracy of
82.2% for discriminating the stabilizing and destabilizing mutants.
Furthermore, a web server has been developed for prediction and it
is available at http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/wetstab.htm.
2 METHODS
2.1 Protein mutant dataset
In this work, we have collected a set of double mutants from
ProTherm database (Gromiha et al., 1999a; Kumar et al., 2006)
(http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/protherm/protherm.html) in which
the free energy changes of mutants were obtained with thermal denaturation.
We removed the redundant data and averaged out the free energy
changes of mutants when multiple data were reported in the literature
for the same mutants with same experimental conditions. The final non-
redundant dataset consists of 180 mutants acquired from 27 different
proteins. The G ranges between -8.9kcal/mol and 6.2 kcal/mol and
the number of stabilizing and destabilizing mutants is 93 and 87,
respectively. The datasets used in the present study are available
at http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/wetstab.htm. The occurrence of
stabilizing and destabilizing mutants in different secondary structures and
at various ranges of solvent accessibility is given in Supplementary Table
S1. Most of the data were obtained with reversible process (71%) and the
reversibility is not reported for 24% of the data.
2.2 Sequence based attribute sets
We have utilized two different sets of attributes M1 and M2 as input variables
to represent a double mutant. M1 refers to the attributes for the first mutant
and M2 for the second mutant. Each attribute set consists of eight attributes,
including (i) wild-type residue (attribute 1) and (iii) mutant residue (attribute
2) and (iii) three neighboring residues of the mutation site along both
directions (attributes 3–8). In addition, attribute set M12 refers to all attributes

at both sites, namely, those attributes in both M1 and M2. The schematic view
of the attributes is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Earlier studies have
shown that three neighboring residues can efficiently predict stability changes
on single mutants (Cheng et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2007a; Huang et al.,
2007b) and the wild-type and mutant residues are important attributes for
discriminating stability changes (Huang et al., 2006). The stability of buried
mutants is influenced with the type of mutation and that of exposed ones is
governed by neighboring and surrounding residues (Gromiha et al. 1999b).
Furthermore, the free energies of pair-wise interactions of residues depends
on residue composition with an exception of disulfide bonds (Dosztanyi et al.,
2005).
2.3 Analytical framework
Figure 1 sketches our framework for analyzing and predicting stability
changes of protein mutants. Firstly, the mutant dataset obtained from the
thermodynamic database is analyzed in terms of composition, as well as
sequence of amino acid residues. Secondly, two individual decision table
models, T1 and T2 are built from the datasets with attribute sets M1 and M2,
respectively. Whenever a prediction is required, it is made by weighting the
results obtained from the two models.
In addition to predicting the numerical values of stability changes it can
also handle the problem of discriminating the stabilizing and destabilizing
mutants. Furthermore, various performance scores obtained from different
attribute sets and test procedures have been assessed and compared.
2.4 Weighted decision table method
One of the simplest ways of representing the prediction model from
machine learning is to make it the same as the training set. The one-to-
one correspondence between prediction model and training data helps to
understand the meaning of the model and especially in decision trees. In this
study, the inducer of decision table majority algorithm (Kohavi, 1995) was
implemented to build such a representation, called decision table majority,
for the prediction of stability changes.
A decision table majority mainly consists of two components: a schema
and a body. The schema is a set of attributes that are included into the table;
and the body is a list of instances with values defined by the attributes in

with motifs F*V (* denotes any mutation site), L*L, K*A and
A*E stabilize the proteins upon amino acid substitutions. Further
analysis on nearest neighboring residues of the mutation sites
in all the considered mutant proteins showed that the pair of
residues with hydrophobic–hydrophobic, hydrophobic–polar, polar–
hydrophobic and polar–polar motifs stabilize the proteins with the
frequency of 48.9%, 19.4%, 21.5% and 8.6%, respectively. This
result indicates that the hydrophobic environment increases the
stability of protein mutants. On the other hand, the frequencies of
occurrence of destabilizing mutants are 24.3%, 24.3%, 26.5% and
17.8%, respectively. It can be seen from Supplementary Table S2
that the mutants with motifs K*A, G*P, K*Q and L*Q destabilize
the proteins upon double mutation.
3.2 Prediction of protein stability changes upon double
mutation
We have utilized the information on wild-type residue, mutant
residue and three neighboring residues on both sides of double
mutants to discriminate the stabilizing and destabilizing mutants
as well as predicting the stability change upon mutation. The
results are presented in Table 1. Our method could discriminate the
stabilizing and destabilizing mutants with an accuracy of 82.2% and
the predicted stability change of the protein upon double mutation
showed a correlation of 0.75 with experimental data. On the other
hand, the data trained with a simple artificial neural network model
with one hidden layer and two nodes showed an accuracy of 59.4%
and correlation of 0.33.
In Figure 2, we show the relationship between experimental and
predicted stability change of 180 protein mutants obtained with 10-
fold cross-validation method and the dark line shows the linear fit
between them. We have also estimated ROC curves for different
attribute sets (Fig. 3). We observed that the AUC values are 0.81,
0.83, 0.83 and 0.87 for M1, M2, M12 and WET, respectively.
We have compared the performance of our method using the
information about only one mutant (either M1 or M2) as well as
with both mutants. In addition, decision table majority method and
WET has been compared for the performance. We observed that
the WET method with both M1 and M2 information has the best
performance, showing the close relationship between experimental
and predicted protein stability change upon double mutation.

and WET, respectively).
3.3 Role of secondary structure and solvent
accessibility
We have analyzed the performance of our method based on the
location of the mutants at different secondary structures and various
ranges of solvent accessibility. The results obtained for different
combinations of mutants are presented in Table 2 along with the
number of mutants in each category. We observed that the stability
of mutations at regular structures (HH or SS) are better predicted
than that in loops (CC). Furthermore, the stability of mutations in
strand segments showed the accuracy of 89%, which is better than
that in helical segments (78%). This might be due to the presence
of residues in β-strand segments, which are close in space but far
away in sequence (Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004).
The analysis on solvent accessibility showed that the stability
of mutants in hydrophobic core regions can be predicted with an
accuracy of 87%. The accuracies for partially buried and exposed

4 CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a WET for discriminating the stabilizing and
destabilizing mutants and predicting the stability change upon
double mutation by utilizing the information on wild-type, mutant
and three neighboring residues of both mutation sites. Our method
showed an accuracy and correlation of 82% and 0.75, respectively,
for discrimination and prediction. Furthermore, we have analyzed
the influence of neighboring residues and the ability of methods
developed for predicting the stability changes of single mutants. A
web server has been developed for discrimination and prediction
purposes.

Prediction of protein stability upon amino acid substitution is an important problem in designing stable
proteins. We have developed a classiﬁcation rule generator for integrating the knowledge of amino acid
sequence and experimental stability change upon single mutation. These rules are human readable and
hence the method enhances the synergy between expert knowledge and computational system.
Utilizing the information about wild type, mutant, three neighboring residues and experimentally
observed stability data, we have developed a method based on decision tree for discriminating the
stabilizing and destabilizing mutants and predicting the protein stability changes upon single point
mutations, which showed an accuracy of 82% and a correlation of 0.70, respectively. In addition, we
have developed a fuzzy query method to predict protein stability with partial information. We have
developed a web server for predicting the protein stability changes upon single mutations by using
fuzzy query mechanism and it is available at http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/fqstab.htm.

1. Introduction
One of the most important tasks in protein engineering is to
understand the mechanisms responsible for protein stability
changes affected by single point mutations, which can be employed
for constructing temperature sensitive mutants and used to identify
a wide spectrum of drug resistance conferring mutations.
Several methods have been proposed for predicting the
stability of proteins upon amino acid substitutions. These
methods are mainly based on distance and torsion potentials
[1,2], multiple regression techniques [3], energy functions [4],
contact potentials [5], neural networks [6], support vector
machines, SVMs [7,8], average assignment [9], classiﬁcation and
regression tool [10], backbone ﬂexibility [11] etc. Further, it
has been reported that the discrimination of stabilizing and
destabilizing mutants is more important than its magnitude in
many cases [6]. Most of these methods used the information from
the three-dimensional structures of proteins for discrimination/
prediction. On the other hand, prediction accuracy using amino
acid sequence is signiﬁcantly lower than that with structural
data [12].
The methods reported in the literature for predicting mutant
protein stability utilize different kinds of input information and
it is necessary to provide all the required input data for prediction.
However, in practice, the required input information may be
imprecise, incomplete and even unavailable. For example, a
method predicts stability changes using three neighboring
residues on both sides and for some reasons residue information
is available only along one residue. In this situation, it will be
difﬁcult to employ the method for accurate prediction since the
information about the other residues is unknown. Therefore, it
would be constructive to develop an effective method to
overcome the practical problem.
In addition, an increasing amount of experimental data about
protein mutants have been available recently [13,14]. It is
essential to ﬁgure out the data and provide insights on protein
mutant stability. One of the efﬁcient approaches is to acquire
knowledge from the large data automatically. Our earlier studies
have demonstrated that converting the data into human
readable rules is helpful to understand its real meaning and give
related validations [15]. In spite of these studies, it is necessary to
build a system, which derives stability rules for any input data
and convert them into prediction.
To systematically address the above issues, we have
developed a knowledge-based system, which can achieve three
main goals: (i) knowledge acquisition, (ii) stability prediction and

improve the classiﬁcation accuracy and reduce the variance as
well as the bias.
2.4. Fuzzy query method
In the framework of the fuzzy query mechanism, the predic-
tion problem with incomplete input information is considered as
a query to derive the rules. In other words, the prediction is made
by the rules with high reference level, which indicates the
importance of each rule.
For achieving this aim, we ﬁrstly utilized the proposed rule
generator to convert the dataset into 104 classiﬁcation rules along
with the related information. Next, we applied three key
concepts: (i) fuzzy matching is applied to compute the degree of
matching between the input partial information and the ante-
cedent of rules; (ii) fuzzy numbers [23,24] are utilized to
represent linguistic terms (Fig. 2) and (iii) fuzzy weighted
average (FWA) [25–27] is applied to calculate the conﬁdence
level of a rule.
The resulted predictions to a fuzzy query are ranked by the
reference level:
RLi ¼MDiCLi: ð1Þ
It is the multiplication of MDi (the match degree between the
query and the rule Ri) and CLi (the conﬁdence level of rule Ri). The
conﬁdence level CL of the rule is computed by aggregating its
accuracy and the proportion of data (also named support) to the
whole dataset.
FuzzyCLIPS [28] is a knowledge-base programming language
designed especially for developing fuzzy expert systems. The
method utilizes FuzzyCLIPS to deal with imprecision and
uncertainty in fuzzy query and to offer the capability of fuzzy
matching and fuzzy reasoning. The web server is based on a 3-tier
architecture of the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern and
implemented in the technology of java servlet page (JSP).
2.5. Assessment of predictive ability
We have used different measures to assess the accuracy of
discriminating the stabilizing and destabilizing mutants. The term
sensitivity shows the correct prediction of stabilizing mutants,
speciﬁcity about the destabilizing mutants and accuracy indicates
the overall assessment. The agreement between experimental and
predicted stability changes has been assessed with correlation
coefﬁcient. These terms are deﬁned as follows:
Sensitivity¼ TP=ðTPþFNÞ ð2Þ
Specificity¼ TN=ðTNþFPÞ ð3Þ
Accuracy¼ ðTPþTNÞ=ðTPþTNþFPþFNÞ ð4Þ
where, TP, FP, TN and FN refer to the number of true positives,
false positives, true negatives and false negatives, respectively;
correlation is the correlation coefﬁcient, N, Xi and Yi are the total
number of mutants, experimental and predicted stability, respec-
tively and i varies from 1 to N.
We have performed n-fold cross-validation test for assessing
the validity of the present work. In this method, the dataset is
divided into n groups, n1 of them are used for training and the
rest are used for testing the method. The same procedure is
repeated for n times and the average is computed for obtaining
the accuracy of the method. Hence, n different sets of rules have
been developed for n-fold cross-validation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Development of classiﬁcation rules
From the dataset of 1859 mutants, a total of 104 rules were
generated for data mining analysis. The rule size of 2 indicates
that the antecedent of the rule consists of two statements.
Generally, a shorter rule may make the rule easier to understand
and to be examined. We further observed that 1535 samples of
the dataset can match the antecedent of these rules with 175
errors, which showed the accuracy of 88.6%. It reveals that most
samples in the dataset can be correctly inferred by using the
ruleset. In Table 1, we have given few examples of rules and their
details: (i) if the mutated residue is Asp, its third neighbor at
N-terminal is Glu, and its second neighbor at C-terminal is Leu,
then the predicted stability change will be positive (stabilizing);
we obtained an accuracy of 96% in a set of 25 data; (ii) if the
deleted residue is Ser and its ﬁrst neighbor at N-terminal is Pro,
then the predicted stability change will be negative
(destabilizing), which correctly predicted all the 29 data with an
accuracy of 100% and (iii) if the deleted residue is Leu, then the
protein will be destabilizing; this rule is applied to 122 mutants
and 115 are predicted correctly (accuracy 94%).
We have developed a web interface for generating rules for any
set of stability data using wild type, mutant and three neighboring
residue information [29]. The web server can be accessed at
http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/irobot.htm. In addition, all
the 104 rules can be found on this web.
3.2. Prediction of protein stability
We have utilized the rules for discriminating the stabilizing
and destabilizing mutants and predicting the stability change
upon mutation along with the information about pH and T. The
validity of our approach has been assessed with 10- and 20-fold
cross-validation procedures, which yielded the accuracy of 82.0%

derived from three neighboring residues, temperature, pH value,
mutated and mutant types. Then both methods were applied to
the dataset of 1859 non-redundant mutants for stability dis-
crimination. The back-propagation neural network incorporates
four layers. Input and output layers include 32 neurons and 1
neuron, respectively. Two hidden layers contain 3 and 2 neurons,
respectively. The network is trained by a resilient back-propaga-
tion learning algorithm with 100 epochs. In addition, a support
vector machine, using a radial basis function as kernel, is
implemented by a sequential minimal optimization algorithm
for regression in JAVA language.
The ROC curve obtained for the three methods with 20-fold
cross-validation test is shown in Fig. 5. We observed that the
performance of CART is the best among all the three methods. The
areas under the curve (AUC) for CART, SVM and NN are 0.83, 0.75
and 0.66, respectively. Table 2 also provides a comparison
between the present method and other methods on important
measures.
3.3. Prediction with partial information
For a further examination, we have given a query with partial
input information to demonstrate the proposed method. Let Q1 is
a query with the following conditions: (i) mutated residue is Ala;
(ii) mutant residue is Cys; (iii) the second neighbor towards the
N-terminal is Asp; (iv) the importance of the rule accuracy is very
important and (v) the importance of the rule support is
moderately important. The results from submitting query Q1
are shown in Table 2. We have also given different measures for
each rule.
In Table 3, fuzzy matching ﬁrstly ﬁnds all the rules, which
include at least one of the known part elements of the query. For
example, rule no. 93 satisﬁes the condition (i) in Q1. Namely, the
antecedent of rule no. 93 and the query Q1 have a common element:
mutated residue Ala. Hence, there are total ﬁve responded rules,
antecedents of which have different intersections with query Q1.
Those rules found are then considered as the candidates for
predicting stability changes. Next, the reference levels for each
rule are calculated according to the importance of accuracy and
support. The results showed that the rule no. 93 has the highest RL
value of 0.332, indicating that this rule and the query are a good
match and the query may have the same consequent (destabilizing)
as the rule.
Further, we have tested the performance of the method for
predicting the stability change with partial information. Firstly,
we set up a rule with complete information of three conditions,
i.e. mutated residue¼Asp, N3¼Glu and C2¼Leu. This rule
indicates that the consequent is stabilizing; the number of data
and accuracy are 25 and 96%, respectively. Next, we submitted
three queries, each of which lacks a condition from complete
information (i.e. two different conditions instead of three).
Interestingly, the proposed method correctly predicted the
mutants as stabilizing with RL¼0.438 for all the three cases. In
other words, the three queries with 2/3 partial information
achieved an accuracy of 100%. We further reduced the informa-
tion to 1/3 and tested three other queries. Each query contains
only one condition from complete information and the other two
conditions are unknown. Our method correctly predicted two of
the three queries as stabilizing with RL¼0.219 and the overall
accuracy is 67.7%. The above observations show that the proposed
method can perform well for predicting the stability changes with
partial information.
We have developed a web server for predicting the protein
stability changes upon single mutations with partial information
and it is available at http://bioinformatics.myweb.hinet.net/
