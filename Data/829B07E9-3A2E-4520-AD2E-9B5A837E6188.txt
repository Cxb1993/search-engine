Abstract
Interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) is a multiple access technique, which uses an
elementary signal estimator (ESE) to achieve simple chip-by-chip detection. In ﬁrst-year
report, we propose a new elementary signal estimator for IDMA. The resultant IDMA can
achieve simple chip-by-chip detection with additional advantage that arbitrary labelling can
be used for higher-order modulation. In this second-year report, we derive the close-form
formula for the log-likelihood ratio values of the ESE at extremely high signal-to-noise
(SNR) conditions. These results can be combined with EXIT chart analysis to estimate the
error performance of IDMA systems at the SNR regions of the general interest. We also
apply the proposed ESE to IDMA systems using multi-carrier communications. The usage
of arbitrary modulation and labelling can facilitate the bit-loading operation in the multi-
carrier IDMA over an ISI channel. In the third-year report, we discuss IDMA systems with
channel estimation. We extend IDMA principle in the newly introduced channel estimation
function, where the data model for estimation becomes an ordinary Gaussian one, and
its mean square error (MSE) is close to CRLB through the iterative decoding. Besides
IDMA, we also study physical-layer network coding (PNC) problem in the third year. A
new PNC modulation scheme is proposed for two-way relay channel with a relay equipped
two antennas.

I. 計畫的緣由、文獻探討與目的 (Goals)
Interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) [1], [2] is a multiple-access scheme, for which
the user separation is exclusively obtained by the chip-level, user-speciﬁc interleavers with
the aid of low-rate error-correcting codes. It can also be regarded as a code-division multiple-
4order modulation so as to increase data rate of the individual user. In this second-year report,
we devote a lot of our eﬀort to the performance analysis. In particular, we derive the close-
form formula for the log-likelihood ratio values of the ESE at extremely high signal-to-noise
(SNR) conditions, for which feedback with high reliability can be obtained in the iterative
detection for ESE. With the assistance of EXIT analysis, we can obtain estimate the error
performance of the IDMA systems for the general SNR region. The analysis provided in
this report can be applied to the IDMA using either the original ESE or the proposed ESE.
In fact, we show that the original ESE [1], [2] is a special case of the proposed ESE. Since
the usage of arbitrary modulation and labelling can facilitate the bit-loading operation in
the multi-carrier IDMA over an ISI channel, we apply the proposed ESE to IDMA systems
using multi-carrier communications to demonstrate its advantage.
For the nature of IDMA layered data stream, one can embed the pilot signal in the
transmitted data, and use these pilot layers to do channel estimation. Furthermore, the
decoded data value can be used to improve estimation precision during the iterative decoding
procedure. This kind of channel estimation is called semi-blind channel estimation. There
is literature, e.g., [11], [12], [13], related to IDMA with channel estimation. An additional
channel estimation (CE) function is integrated to the receiver. Pilot signals are embedded
into users’ transmitted data, just as another layers of stream. At the receiver side, the CE
function ﬁrst estimates the channels for all users, the ESE uses these estimates as its known
channel values. After DEC decoding, the feedback is not only sent to ESE, but to CE as
well, where the feedback can be used as prior to improve precision of estimates.
In the third year, we discuss channel estimation in IDMA systems. We extend IDMA
principle to the CE function. Similar to the original ESE decoding process, when estimating
one user’s channel, we extract his pilot signal, and approximate the residual signal as a
Gaussian variable, whose mean and variance can be obtained from the DEC feedback. This
estimation data model becomes an ordinary Gaussian model, and is easy to analyze. Our
results also show that the estimate variance is quite close to CRLB (Cramer-Rao lower
bound) after the iterative decoding.
In addition to channel estimation study in the third year, we also do some research in
physical-layer network coding (PNC). We propose a PNC scheme in two-way relay channels
(TWRC) with a multi-antenna relay. This scheme is based on MIMO linear detection. We
61)]T of user-k, 0 ≤ k ≤ K, is encoded by a low-rate error-correcting code C, producing a bi-
nary code sequence ck = [ck(0), . . . , ck(n), . . . , ck(N−1)]T . A user-speciﬁc interleaver pik then
permutes ck to xk = [xk(0), . . . , xk(n), . . . , xk(N − 1)]T . After interleaving, every Qk bits in
xk is grouped together and is mapped into a signal point in the constellation Sk of 2Qk signal
points. Thus, xk is mapped to a symbol sequence yk = [yk(0), . . . , yk(j), . . . , yk(N/Qk−1)]T .
Note that Qk may be diﬀerent from Qk′ for k ̸= k′.
The mapping is given by
yk(j) = map
(
[x
(0)
k (j), . . . , x
(Qk−1)
k (j)]
)
,
where x(q)k (j), q = 0, . . . , Qk − 1, is the q-th bit in the j-th transmitted symbol yk(j) of user
k. The two notations, xk(n) and x(q)k (j), refer to the same coded bit when n = j · Qk + q.
These two representations will be used interchangeably in this report for the convenience
of presentation. We also denote the q-th bit of a symbol s ∈ Sk by bq(s). For example, if
yk(j) = map ([0010]), then bi(yk(j)) = 0 for i = 0, 1, 3 and b2(yk(j)) = 1.
The receiver consists of two parts: an elementary signal estimator (ESE) and a bank of
decoders (DECs). The ESE takes a stream of received signals and K streams of a priori
information as input and then generates K streams of extrinsic information as output. Each
output stream, after de-interleaving, is then used as the input of the decoder of a speciﬁc
user. The output of each decoder is sent back to the ESE as the a priori information for the
next iteration of decoding. This iteratively decoding structure is a kind of iterative (turbo)
multiuser detection [6].
For the original ESE of the IDMA system in [1], [2], only BPSK or Gray-mapped QPSK
can be used, since the original ESE relies on independently-mapped binary signals. Thus,
non-Gray mapped QPSK may fail the algorithm. Hence, in the following subsection, we
propose a new ESE, called the general ESE, which can process signals with an arbitrary
modulation and labelling.
B. The General ESE
Let hk denote the channel gain (including the eﬀect of power control) of the k-th user,
1 ≤ k ≤ K. This value is assumed to be constant within a whole received symbol block.
8is the sum of interference and noise against user k. According to the central limit theorem,
ζk can be approximated as a Gaussian random variable. Therefore P{r|yk = s} can be
approximated as Gaussian distributed.
We can express the probability P{r|yk = s} as a vector form, where r = (rre rim)T ,
yk = (y
re
k y
im
k )
T , and s = (sre sim)T . Let µζk and Ξζk be the mean and covariance matrix
of ζk = (ζrek ζ imk )T respectively. The pdf (probability density function) of this Gaussian 2-D
real vector is
P{r|yk = s} =
1
2pi · |Ξζk |1/2
·
exp
{
−1
2
(r − (Hks+ µζk))TΞ−1ζk (r − (Hks+ µζk))
}
,
(7)
where
Hk ≡
ρk cos θk −ρk sin θk
ρk sin θk ρk cos θk

is the rotation matrix on the 2-D plane representing the channel gain hk = ρkejθk on the
complex plane. >From (5), the mean and covariance matrix of ζk can be calculated as
follows:
µr =
K∑
k=1
Hkµyk , (8)
Ξr =
K∑
k=1
HkΞykH
T
k + σ
2I, (9)
µζk = µr −Hkµyk , (10)
Ξζk = Ξr −HkΞykHTk , (11)
where µyk and Ξyk are the mean and covariance matrix of yk = (yrek yimk )T respectively.
3) Updating µyk and Ξyk : The soft-output values from DEC are sent back to ESE as a
priori values of coded bits, i.e.,
eDEC(x
(q)
k (j)) = ln
P{x(q)k (j) = 0}
P{x(q)k (j) = 1}
.
These a priori values are used to update the probability of the signal points in the con-
stellation. By the independence assumption, the probability of a constellation point can be
10
xk(0) from the probability condition. Similarly, we can derive
eESE(x
(1)
k ) ≡ ln
P{r|x(1)k = 0}
P{r|x(1)k = 1}
= ln P{(h
∗
kr)
im|x(1)k = 0}
P{(h∗kr)im|x(1)k = 1}
. (13)
The original ESE algorithm in [1] for Gray-labelled QPSK is derived based on eESE(x(0)k ) =
ln(P{(h∗kr)re|x(0)k = 0}/P{(h∗kr)re|x(0)k = 1}) and eESE(x(1)k ) = ln(P{(h∗kr)im|x(1)k = 0}/
P{(h∗kr)im|x(1)k = 1}). Hence, we see that the proposed general ESE includes the original
ESE as a special case. The original ESE is essentially designed for the one-dimensional
constellation with two signal points, i.e., 2-PAM or BPSK, while the Gray-labelled QPSK
can be regarded as two independent BPSK. The one-dimensional design of the original ESE
prohibits its application in the non-Gray-labelled QPSK or higher-order modulation.
D. Performance Analysis
1) Exit chart analysis: Let RCk be the code rate and RMk be the modulation rate,
i.e., code bits per transmitted symbol, of each user. The low-rate error-correcting codes C
adopted in the EXIT chart analysis and the simulation are constructed by concatenating a
convolutional code with generator (23, 35)8 and a length-16 or length-12 repetition code [1]
respectively. Thus, the code rate is either RCk = 1/2× 1/16 = 1/32 or RCk = 1/2× 1/12 =
1/24. System throughput T which is the sum of the transmission rates of all users can be
calculated as
T =
K∑
k=1
RCk ·RMk bits/complex dimension, (14)
where K is the total number of users. Since a user may be assigned multiple layers as its
own transmission, in the system throughput point of view, users and layers can be used
interchangeably [2], [3], [14], [15]. In this report, the notation “modulation×K” may be
used to represent a single-layer and K-user IDMA system using the speciﬁc modulation, or
a K-layer and single-user IDMA system using the speciﬁc modulation, or an L-layer and
K/L-user IDMA system using the speciﬁc modulation. For example, the “QPSK× 16” with
RCk = 1/32 will yield a system throughput of T = 1 bit/complex dimension for either the
single-layer 16-user IDMA or the 2-layer 8-user IDMA system.
Fig. 2 shows the EXIT chart of the proposed ESE using Gray-labelled QPSK and non-
Gray-labelled QPSK respectively, where K = 16 users are assumed and Eb/N0 levels of 0
12
ESE. Hence, at Eb/N0 of 0 dB, the advantage of better E(eESE) under the condition of
feedback with high reliability can not be employed.
2) Feedback with High Reliability: We would like to see the QPSK performance in the
iterative detection with feedback of high reliability. From this analysis, we can predict the
behavior of various modulation techniques under high reliability regime, which correspond
the right most intersection for an ESE EXIT curves. The feedback from the k-th decoder
for the operation of ESE detection is {La(x(q)k ) | q = 0, 1 and k = 1, . . . , K}. We assume the
extreme case that in the iterative detection, the feedback from each decoder is perfect except
for the bit to be determined in the ESE. Hence, each term in the product∏l ̸=q P{x(l)k = bl(s)}
of (3) is either 1 or 0 and then P{r|x(q)k = a} is reduced to P{r|yk = s}, where s = sab or s
= sba with b a determined value. With (7) and (4), we have

Fig. 3. Parallel transmission of multi-carrier IDMA with L subchannels in the frequency domain, where
{xk1, . . . ,xkL} and {Ak1, . . . , AkL} are the bit and power loading distributions respectively.
3) Multi-carrier Transmitter: The system under consideration uses OFDM with L sub-
carriers. Fig. 3 shows the multi-carrier transmitter of a user in frequency domain, where
Hk1, . . . , HkL represent the L channel gains of each subcarrier. Here, we implicitly assume
that under OFDM transmission, the length of cyclic preﬁx is longer than that of multipath
delay of the channel. For user k, the block of code-bits, xk, is split into L sub-blocks,
xk1, . . . ,xkL. The number of bits in xkl on the l-th subcarrier depends on the result of the
loading algorithm and is restricted by the modulation types for which we use. For example, if
we use QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and 256QAM as our possible loading levels, the number of
bits in xkl can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, for all l, where length of 0 indicates that the corresponding
subcarrier is not used. In addition to bit allocation, we use Ak1, . . . , AkL to represent the
power loading distribution on each subcarrier.
4) Multi-carrier Receiver: At the receiver side, multiple access should be done on each
subcarrier in frequency domain. There are L ESEs and each of them performs multiple
access for a subchannel. The received symbol
rl =
K∑
k=1
HklAklykl +Wl, l = 1, . . . , L (21)
represents the superposition of signals from all the K users, where Wl is the frequency
domain AWGN noise. Note that Akl is the power loading factor which does not appear in
(1) because no loading is considered in single-carrier cases.
After carrying out ESE operations, the LLR (log likelihood ratio) values of the transmitted
symbols of each user are extracted and sent to K streams. These K streams of LLR values,
after de-interleaving, are used as input to the decoder of individual user, whose output is

At the receiver side, a new channel estimator function is added to the receiver, as shown in
Fig. 4. This new channel estimator function provides its channel estimates for ESE, and use
the feedback from DEC as its prior to calculate the channel estimates at the next iteration.
Here we assume a single-path quasi-static channel, and the received signal can be written
as

C. MSE Analysis
We analyze the variance of our estimator and compare it to Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB). After Gaussian approximation, we are using a standard Gaussian model for our
channel estimation. For convenience, we rewrite the system model here,
r(j)− µηk(j) = hkpk(j) +
(
ηk(j)− µηk(j)
)
, j = 0, . . . , J − 1. (34)
Without any confusion, we simplify the notation and omit user index k,
sj = pjh+ zj, j = 0, . . . , J − 1, (35)
where zj ∼ CN (0, σ2zj), j = 0, . . . , J − 1. We assume σ2zj = σ2z for all j.
V. 研究方法 - Multiple-Access Application in Physical-Layer Network
Coding
A. Two-way Relay Channel
Consider a two-way relay channel as shown in Fig. 5. The two end nodes, N1 and N2,
exchange information through the relay node R. There is no direct link between N1 and N2.
All nodes are half-duplex, i.e., a node can not transmit and receive simultaneously. In this
paper, we discuss the MIMO relay case for which the relay has two antennas and each of
the two end nodes has a single antenna.
A PNC transmission [22], [23] consists of two phases. In the ﬁrst phase which is the MA
(multiple-access) phase, both end nodes transmit their information to the relay simultane-
ously. We assume a symbol level synchronization at the relay. The received signal can be
20
C. MIMO-PNC scheme-I
In [25] which is referred as MIMO-PNC scheme-I in this paper, a sum-diﬀerence matrix
D is introduced to detect the network-coded symbols from a sum/diﬀerence signal space.
Rewrite (36) as
yR = (HD
−1)(Dx) + z = H˜x˜+ z, (38)
where D = 2D−1 =
 1 1
1 −1
. The detection is based on the equivalent channel matrix
H˜ . For example, the ZF detector G = (H˜∗H˜)−1H˜∗. The sum-diﬀerence data x˜ = [x1 +
x2 x1 − x2]T can be estimated from the detector, and can be then mapped to the desired
network coded symbol. To further enhance the performance, LLR combining is used for the
ﬁnal decision.
D. MIMO-PNC scheme-II
In this section, we show the proposed MIMO-PNC mapping scheme referred in this paper
as MIMO-PNC scheme-II.
1) Detection on Superimposed Constellation: In addition to the linear MIMO detector,
we introduce a linear combiner a as
aGyR = aGHx+ aGz, (39)
where a is a 1×2 real-valued vector. The expression (39) can be considered as the simpliﬁed
channel
r = s+ n, (40)
where r = aGyR, s = aGHx, and n = aGz. The signal s is located in the superimposed
constellation of aGHx. In the ZF case, aGHx = ax, since G is the pseudo-inverse of H .
Then, we have s ∈ a1X1 + a2X2 = {a1x1 + a2x2|x1 ∈ X1, x2 ∈ X2}, where a = [a1 a2] and
Xj is the constellation used in node-j. Note that a1 and a2 are real numbers. Suppose that
X1 and X2 are signal points in the constellation of Gray-labelled QPSK symbols as shown
in Fig. 6, where d denotes the minimum distance within the points. Then, Fig. 7 shows the
superimposed constellation with a = [1 1].
22
necessary to be both positive. Let am = min{|a1|, |a2|} and aM = max{|a1|, |a2|}. The
distance relationship within the points can be shown in Fig. 8.
The label of each signal point in Fig. 8 is obtained from two components. For example, if
a point is obtained from a1x1 + a2x2, where x1 =M(b1) and x2 =M(b2), then its label is
b1⊕b2. Since we have four outcomes of a 2-bit label, the points in Fig. 8 can be grouped by
four sets according to their labels. Since the two end nodes adopt the same labelling scheme,
i.e., Gray-labelled QPSK as shown in Fig. 6, the four groups can be always separated as
Sa = {s1, s4, s13, s16}
Sb = {s2, s3, s14, s15}
Sc = {s5, s8, s9, s12}
Sd = {s6, s7, s10, s11},
where a, b, c, and d represent the four possible labels. We can write the symbol error rate
as the sum of its group-wise components as
Pe =P{sˆ /∈ Sa|s ∈ Sa}P{s ∈ Sa}+
P{sˆ /∈ Sb|s ∈ Sb}P{s ∈ Sb}+
P{sˆ /∈ Sc|s ∈ Sc}P{s ∈ Sc}+
P{sˆ /∈ Sd|s ∈ Sd}P{s ∈ Sd},
(41)
where sˆ is the estimated symbol. Each group-wise term in (41) can be further bounded by its
point-wise symbol error probabilities. For example, the symbol error probability for group
a can be bounded by
P{sˆ /∈ Sa|s ∈ Sa}P{s ∈ Sa}
≤
∑
i=1,4,13,16
P{sˆ ≠ si|s = si}P{s = si}.
(42)
Since the constellation is a square QAM-like shape, we can easily calculate the symbol
error probability. The constellation can be separated into nine detection areas whose bound-
aries are shown as the dashed lines in Fig. 8. There are four areas with one point, four for
two points, and one for four points.
24
Fig. 8. Superimposed constellation ax for a = [a1 a2], where am = min{|a1|, |a2|}, aM = max{|a1|, |a2|}, and d is
the minimum distance of each component constellation. The dashed lines represent the detection boundaries.
From Lemma 1, the two forms of Q-function terms in (43) can be written as
Q

)

(√(

)
= Q
(√(
(2aM − am)2

)
Es

)
. (46)
By substituing (45) and (46) into (43), we can obtain the relationship between the linear
combiner a and the symbol error rate.
3) To Obtain Optimized a: The linear combiner a plays an important role in our method.
The restriction that a is real keeps the superimposed constellation a square QAM-like shape.
Hence, its symbol error rate can be obtained very easily. Furthermore, choosing an optimized
value of a can further result in better performance. From the SER bound in (44), we can
minimize the right-hand-side value to get better SER. Thus, we calculate the optimized a
by minimizing the right-hand-side in (44), for which relationship with a is obtained from

VI. 研究成果 (Results)
We provide simulation results for IDMA systems using the proposed ESE over AWGN
channels to verify the analysis given in Section II-D. In the simulation, the information block
length is I = 512 and the number of iterations is 10, except for only one case of which the
iteration number is 20.

T = 1 bit/complex dimension.
We show performance comparisons within multi-carrier IDMA with loading based on
the simulation results. According to the loading results, the higher modulation rate are
accomplished by superposition coding of Gray- or Non-Gray-labelled QPSK, or by directly
using higher order modulation with set-partition labelling. The channels are generated by an
exponentially decaying multipath Rayleigh fading model. Denote h = [h(0), h(1), . . . , h(ν −
1)]T as the ν-path channel impulse response whose exponentially decaying power delay proﬁle
is

{|h(i)|2} = βe−i/ν , 0 ≤ i ≤ ν − 1,
where β is a scaling factor such that the total average power is normalized to unity. In our
simulations, we set ν = 8 to generate the quasi-static fading channels and use 64 subcarriers
and cyclic preﬁx of length 16 for OFDM transmission. For each user, the low-rate error
correcting code is constructed by serial concatenating a convolutional code with generator
(23, 35)8 and a length-16 repetition code. Information block length I = 512 and the iteration
number is 5 for all the systems in our simulation.
Fig. 10 shows the performance of the three systems with loading. A transmission rate of
128 bits per OFDM block is ﬁxed for each user. In average, each subcarrier is responsible for
transmitting 2 bits per OFDM block. Results for the single-user case and the 16-user case
are respectively shown. Since we assume that channel state information is available for each
transmitter, in a multiuser fading environment, multiuser gain [19], [20] can be exploited
by the loading algorithm. >From the simulation results, we see that performance gain can
be achieved from using non-Gray labelled higher-order QAM constellations or superposition
coded QPSK, which is a direct result from the single carrier cases.

by the loading algorithm. From the simulation results, we see that performance gain can

C. Results of IDMA with Channel Estimation
In this section, we show the simulation results of IDMA with channel estimation. We
assume quasi-static single-path Rayleigh fading channel in the simulations. All other simu-
lation parameters are all the same from the previous sections.
Fig. 11 shows the BER performance of IDMA-CE in which diﬀerent power distribution of
between data and pilot are considered. For example, in the ﬁgure, “d.9+p.1” indicates that
90% of transmitting power is given to user data and 10% to the pilot. From the results,
we can see that only 10% of transmitting power is enough for pilot signal to do channel
estimation.

our scheme. However, some channel conditions may favor other a values which can provide
further performance gain. The performance gain brought by an optimized a would become
more evident in the MMSE-based schemes.
VII. 研究與討論 (Concluding Remarks)
In the ﬁrst-year-report, a new elementary signal estimator (ESE) for interleave-division
multiple-access (IDMA) so that modulation with an arbitrary labelling can be employed.
In contrast, the original IDMA design can employ modulation with Gray-labelling only. In
this second-year report, we analyze an extreme feedback condition. Under the condition of
highly reliable feedback, the average ESE value can be calculated for various modulation
and labelling schemes. We provide analysis to see the condition in which IDMA using non-
Gray-labelled modulation can prevail over that using Gray-labelled modulation. Since the
condition varies according to the signal-to-noise ratio, the number of users, and the error-
correcting code in the system, we use the EXIT chart to predict the behavior of iterative

AbstractApplying interblock memory to binary linear block
codes is a method to increase the transmission reliability by
increasing the correlation among codewords. In this paper, we
consider short block coding with interblock memory. Since short
block codes can be efciently decoded by employing the A∗
Algorithm, we investigate the performance of short block coding
with interblock memory using the A∗ decoding. In addition, we
propose a simple method which can alleviate the effect of error
propagation resulting from interblock memory.
I. INTRODUCTION
It has been shown that maximum likelihood (ML) decoding
for binary linear block codes is NP-hard. Several research
works aim at a efficient decoding algorithm with computa-
tionally feasible complexity while it still achieves the near-
optimal error performance [1]–[8]. Nowadays, to design an
efficient soft-decision ML decoding for linear block codes is
still a challenging problem.
A binary linear (n, k) block code C can be decoded based
on tree searching. In the code tree, each node stores the accu-
mulated received information so far as its path metric, and each
edge connecting two nodes represents binary symbol 0 or 1.
Each codeword of C is represented by a path P = c1c2 · · · cn,
ci ∈ {0, 1}, from the root node at level 0 to one goal node at
level n. The decoding complexity is exponentially increased
with k. Hence, the tree search decoding is only feasible for
short block codes. The A∗ algorithm is an efficient tree search
decoding method [1] [4], by which the entire codewords are
represented by a binary tree derived from the generator matrix
of C. The decoding based on the A∗ algorithm can achieve
ML performance if there is no restriction on the search space.
The efficiency of the A∗ algorithm for decoding block codes
can be improved by employing reliability-based permutation
on the received signals [1], by simplifying the path metric [3],
or by utilizing early information of parity bits for eliminating
unlikely search paths [5]. Other decoding applications of the
A∗ algorithm could be found in [9], [10].
In general, to increase the transmission reliability without
sacrificing the coding rate, we need to increase the code length
n. For any of the currently known A∗ algorithms, increasing
the code length beyond 128 will result in prohibitive decoding
complexity. One approach is to employ multilevel coding con-
struction with multistage decoding, for example, the Plotkin
This work was supported by National Science Council of R.O.C under
grant NSC 98-2218-E-002-067-MY3
type construction [11], whose complexity increases linearly
with the stage number. The problem is that, it is difficult to
combine efficient short block codes for the multilevel coding
to achieve a desired code rate.
The concept of interblock memory is to create interde-
pendency among adjacent code blocks, so that the distance
property can be improved. In [12], a block coded modulation
scheme with interblock memory is proposed, in which correla-
tion between adjacent two blocks is realized by concatenating
a delay processor and a signal mapper to the block encoder. In
the encoding, some portion of current code block is delayed,
and the delayed portion is correlated to some portion of the
next code block through a signal mapper. At the receiver,
k data bits can be decoded for each n symbols received if
BPSK modulation is considered, and hence the rate efficiency
and decoding latency remain the same. With proper design of
the signal mapper, it can achieve larger minimum Euclidean
distance in the high SNR regime; nevertheless, there is in-
evitably severe error propagation at low SNR values. In [13]
and [14], generalized implementations of interblock memory
for convolutional coding and turbo coding are investigated,
respectively. Similarly, these schemes undergo obvious per-
formance degradation in low SNR.
In this paper, we apply interblock memory to a short
block code C of rate 1/2 and investigate the associated error
performance obtained by using the A∗ decoding. The coding
with interblock memory under consideration, denoted as C+,
also has a code rate of 1/2 and is easily implemented by using
a delay-and-XOR processor for the codewords of C. Suppose
that C is an (n, n/2) code. Then, for C+, we transmit one
block or equivalently n code bits for each time unit. At the
expense of decoding delay by one additional time unit, better
error rate of C+ using the A∗ algorithm can be obtained as
compared to the performance of applying maximum likelihood
decoding to C. This is due to the additional correlation for
C+ introduced by the interblock memory. Using interblock
memory also contributes faster decoding convergence. The
required average decoding complexity for C+ can be sig-
nificantly reduced in the high SNR regime as compared to
that for C. In addition, we propose an approach, with little
complexity, to mitigate the effect of error propagation in the
A∗ decoding for C+. The idea is to detect the reliability of
the decoded codeword. If the output codeword is unreliable,
the associated portion of received signals will not be used

node, denoted as N2, with sgn qj+1 6= sgn(−1)cj+1 ,
is λj+12 = λ
j + |q′j+1|. If j + 1 < k, go to Step 2;
otherwise, go to Step 3.
Step 2 For N1, place it on the top of the stack. For N2, if
λj+12 < λref , place it in the stack in which its order
is based on the metric priority; otherwise, drop N2.
Return to Step 1.
Step 3 For i = 1, 2, Ni is at level k, which can be extended
to a unique goal node, denoted as N gi . According
to (1), Ng1 and N
g
2 have complete path metrics λ1
and λ2, respectively. Then, if λ1 < λref , set λref =
λ1 and place N
g
1 on the bottom of the stack. Then,
compare λ2 to λref . If λ2 < λref , set λref = λ2
and place Ng2 on the bottom of the stack.
Step 4 For each node in the stack, compare its partial (or
complete) path metric λj
′
(or λ) to λref . If λj
′
≥
λref (or λ ≥ λref ), remove the node from the stack.
Step 5 If there is a goal node, which represents a complete
codeword c∗ and is on the top of the stack, the
algorithm terminates and use pi−1(c∗) as the decoded
codeword; otherwise, return to Step 1.
B. Decoding for the Interblock Memory Coded Scheme
Since each code block of C+ is correlated with its adjacent
code blocks, the optimum decoding for each code block of C
requires taking all the transmitted blocks into consideration,
which is impractical. Hence, we employ a suboptimum strat-
egy with reasonable complexity and additional decoding delay
of only one time unit. It is a two-stage decoding algorithm. For
decoding in the (l + 1)th time unit, the decoder utilizes rl =(
r(bl−1
⊕
al), r(al)
)
and rl+1 =
(
r(bl
⊕
al+1), r(al+1)
)
. In
the first stage, a channel-value estimator and a soft-information
combinator are used to obtain qla and qlb, i.e., the estimates
of soft channel information for al and bl, respectively. In
the second stage, the A∗ decoding is operated with (qla, qlb)
as input. Denote the decoder output as cˆl = (aˆl, bˆ
l
). The
algorithm is described as follows.
Step 1 The additional soft information r+(al) for al is
computed based on, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n/2,
r+(ali) =
{
r(ali
⊕
bl−1i ) if b̂
l−1
i = 0
−r(ali
⊕
bl−1i ) if b̂
l−1
i = 1,
(2)
where bˆ
l−1
= {bl−1i }
n/2
i=1 can be obtained from the
previous decoder output. Then the soft-information
combinator generates qla = r+(al) + r(al).
Step 2 Let Lc(bl
⊕
al+1) = 2σ2 r(b
t ⊕ al+1), and
Lc(al+1) = 2σ2 r(a
l+1). The channel-value estimator
generates qlb = {qlb,i}
n/2
i=1 based on [11]
qlb,i = σ
2 tanh−1
(
tanh
(Lc(bli ⊕ al+1i )
2
)
× tanh
(Lc(al+1i )
2
))
.
(3)
Step 3 Use (qla, qlb) as the input to the decoder, and perform
the A∗ decoding algorithm. Then, we can obtain the
decoded codeword cˆl. Note that the decoding of the
next block needs the information of cˆl.
C. Simulation Results
We perform simulations by using the (48,24,12) and
(104,52,20) extended quadratic residue (QR) codes and the
(128,64,22) extended BCH code. The modulation is BPSK and
the transmission is assumed to work on a AWGN channel. For
practical implementation, we place a limitation on the size of
the stack. With the finite stack size S, the A∗ decoding is sub-
optimum and does not perform ML decoding. In case that the
number of visited nodes needed to be recoded is greater than
S, the non-goal node with the largest λ is dropped. Figs. 2,
3, and 4, show the BER simulation results for the QR(48,24),
the QR(104,52), and the BCH(128,64) codes, respectively. The
coded scheme without interblock memory (IB) and is referred
as the primitive scheme. The ML performance of the primitive
scheme is simulated with S being infinite, and the ML lower
bound for BCH(128,64) is simulated based on [15]. It can be
seen that in high SNR the IB scheme offers 0.3 ∼ 0.6 dB
coding gain over the primitive scheme. However, due to the
effect of error propagation, which usually occurs in the multi-
stage decoding, there is performance loss in low SNR.
For comparison of the decoding complexity, note that the IB
scheme requires extra complexity for employing the two-stage
decoding. Despite this fact, the A∗ algorithm dominates the
decoding complexity since its complexity grows exponentially
with k. Complexity of the two-stage decoding is as follows.
In Step 1, to obtain r+(al) based on (2) requires nO(1)
complexity, and n/2 addition operations are required for the
soft-information combinator. In Step 2, n multiplication op-
erations are needed to calculate Lc(bl
⊕
al+1) and Lc(al+1),
and n multiplication operations and 3n/2 table-lookups (for
tanh and tanh−1 functions) are needed for the channel-value
estimator.
To evaluate the complexity of the A∗ decoding, the author in
[3] have found that the decoding time is approximately directly
proportional to the number of search tree edges required. We
thus used the average number of search tree edges as a measure
for the decoding complexity. Fig. 5 shows the mean search tree
edges normalized with the information length. We see that
although there is a little growth of complexity in low SNR,
the IB scheme achieves significant reduction in complexity
compared to the primitive scheme in medium to high SNR.
Because the convergence speed of the tree search decoding
heavily depends on the reliability of received signals, and for
the IB scheme the reliability information for the al part is
enhanced.
IV. AN IMPROVED DECODING TECHNIQUE FOR
MITIGATING ERROR PROPAGATION
In Section III-B, we see that the two-stage decoding indeed
exploits the benefit of the IB scheme by providing additional
received information for the al part. However, the additional165

Fig. 6. Statistical CDF of λ∗ for the IB coded scheme using QR(104,52)

of our interest, for each simulation sample, if bˆ
l−1
contains
errors, then r+(al) is set to zero. Values of λ∗ are recorded as
follows. If x < λ∗ < x+1, x ∈ {0, 1, 2, · · · , 8}, it is recorded
as x + 0.5. If λ∗ > 9, it is recorded as 9.5.
In Fig. 6, we found that only 0.58%, 0.52%, and 1.45% of
all samples are in error for λ∗ < 4 at Eb/N0 =1dB, 2dB, and
3dB, respectively. In fact, no erroneous samples are observed
for λ∗ < 2. Besides, only 3.02%, 0.31%, and 0.005% of all
samples are correct for λ∗ > 7 at Eb/N0 =1dB, 2dB, and 3dB,
respectively. Thus, it seems that a sample with small value of
λ∗ is very likely to be correct. Inspired by the distribution
behavior, we provide the following modification for the two-
stage decoding to mitigate the effect of error propagation. Let
λLTh and λ
H
Th be two path metric thresholds to be chosen. The
parameter of qla of Step 1 in Section III-B is modified as
qla =

r(al) + r+(al) if λ∗ < λLTh,
r(al) + αr+(al) if λLTh ≤ λ∗ ≤ λHTh,

is a weighting coefficient. In (4), we
assume that the smaller λ∗ is, the more reliable the decoded
codeword is, and the relationship is linear. Note that this
approach is very simple since λ∗ can be obtained directly from
of the A∗ decoding.
Simulation results of this modified method, named IB-
modified scheme, are also given in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. Compared
to the IB scheme, the IB-modified scheme provides a gain in
the range of 0.2 ∼ 0.6 dB for the low SNR regime and a gain
of approximately 0.2 dB for the high SNR regime.
V. CONCLUSION REMARKS
This paper proposes to apply the A∗ algorithm and a two-
stage decoding method to decode a coding structure that is
constructed by adding interblock memory to short binary linear
block codes. Simulation results show that good transmission
reliability over the Gaussian channel can be obtained with very
short decoding delay if the processing time can be ignored. An
improved decoding is also proposed to alleviate the effect of
error propagation which results from the two-stage decoding.
Better BER performance can then be achieved with only a
very minor increase of decoding complexity.
