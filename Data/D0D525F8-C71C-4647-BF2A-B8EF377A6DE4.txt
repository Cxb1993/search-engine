英文摘要 
This paper reports the influences of uniaxial 
mechanical stress on the reverse-biased 
source/drain-substrate junction leakage of 
state-of-the-art 65nm CMOS transistors. For 
NMOS transistors, the band-to-band tunneling 
(BTBT) dominates the junction leakage current 
due to heavily doped junction and pocket 
implant. However, for PMOS transistors with 
embedded SiGe source/drain, the leakage current 
is found to result from both BTBT and 
generation current because of the defects 
generated in the SiGe layer and at the SiGe/Si 
interface. A four-point bending technique is used 
to apply mechanical uniaxial stress on N- and 
PMOS devices along the longitudinal direction. 
The leakage current of both devices increases 
(decreases) with applied uniaxial compressive 
(tensile) stress, and the strain sensitivity of 
junction leakage for NMOS transistors are much 
weaker than that of PMOS transistors. By 
combining the bending technique with Process 
Strained Si (PSS) technology, additional stress 
was applied on N- and PMOS with high built-in 
stress to investigate the characteristics of 
junction leakage under extremely high uniaxial 
stress. It is shown that uniaxial tensile stress can 
enhance the NMOS devices performance but not 
degrade the characteristics of junction leakage. 
But there exists a trade-off between boosting the 
PMOS transistors performance and decreasing 
the junction leakage current. 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
For the last 40 years, CMOS devices have 
been scaled aggressively to maintain it’s 
historical rate of performance improvements. 
However, the enhanced performance through 
scaling has come at the cost of a significant 
increase in the off-state leakage current, 
resulting in escalating power consumption [1,2]. 
The off-state leakage current of MOSFETs 
mainly arises from: (1) subthreshold leakage, (2) 
gate leakage, and (3) reverse biased junction 
band-to-band tunneling leakage [2-4]. In the 
regime of submicron channel lengths, the total 
leakage current is dominated by subthreshold 
and gate leakage due to the reduced threshold 
voltage and gate oxide thickness, respectively. 
However, as devices are scaled further into the 
nanometer regime, the increased substrate 
doping and pocket implant concentrations, which

Fig. 1.The schematic cross sections of (a) NMOS 
structure and (b) PMOS structure with Contact 
Etch Stop Layers (CESL). (c) The ID-VD 
characteristics of devices for LGate = 39nm with 
three types of CESL.  
The ID-VD characteristics of 39nm gate 
length NMOS and PMOS devices with three 
types of CESL are shown in Fig. 1(c). As shown, 
NMOS with a thick tensile-CESL shows a 4% 
ION improvement as compared to the device with 
a thin-tensile CESL, where ION is defined as the 
drain current at VG – VT = 1V and VD = 1V.  
This is expected as a thicker tensile-CESL will 
introduce a higher tensile stress in the channel 
region of the device [14]. On the other hand, the 
ION improvement of the PMOS device with a 
compressive-CESL is 14% larger compared to 
the device with a thin tensile-CESL. Again, this 
is expected since compressive strain is known to 
enhance the hole mobility [6]. 
A uniaxial compressive or tensile stress can 
be applied on devices to change the performance 
by using the four-point bending technique. 
Unlike PSS technology, a uniaxial stress 
generated by this method is not affected by 
process issues, and could be used to explore 
more accurate responses of devices 
characteristics under various levels of stress. Fig. 
2 shows the on-current enhancement (ΔIon/Ion0) 
of NMOS and PMOS devices with a thin 
tensile-CESL for physical gate lengths of 60 and 
42 nm, versus applied longitudinal uniaxial 
bending stress. It is observed that Ion 
improvement of NMOS- and PMOS devices 
could be linearly increased by applying 
additional mechanical bending tensile and 
compressive stress, respectively. Higher strain 
sensitivity in ION enhancement was found in 
PMOS compared to in NMOS devices with the 
same channel length. This results from (1) the 
higher piezoresistive coefficient for PMOS 
devices under uniaxial longitudinal stress and (2) 
the lower ratio of source/drain parasitic 
resistance (RSD) to channel resistance (RCH) of 
PMOS devices [15]. In addition, for both NMOS 
and PMOS devices, lower strain sensitivity of 
ION enhancement was found in the shorter 
channel devices (LGate = 42 nm) compared to in 
the longer channel devices (LGate = 60 nm), and 
it attributed to RSD becoming more prominent 
and ultimately hurting the strain-induced 
enhancement in shorter channel devices [15,16]. 
Fig. 2 also depicts the ION improvement in 
NMOS devices with thick tensile-CESL and 
PMOS devices with compressive-CESL as a 
function of applied bending stress. The same 
slopes of strain sensitivities in on-current 
enhancement were found within devices of the 
same gate length with thin tensile-CESL, which 
indicates that: (1) devices (NMOS or PMOS) 
used in this study are the same (substrate doping 
concentration, RSD value, etc.) with the 
exception of different CESLs, and (2) device 
improvements induced by strain haven’t reached 
saturation yet and can be further improved 
through stronger strain technologies.

leakage current, and the results are shown in Fig. 
3 (b). For junction diodes, the reverse leakage 
current is dominated by generation current Jgen, 
which can be described by the following 
equation [19]:

Because strain-induced changes in energy 
bandgap result in an exponential increase of the 
intrinsic carrier concentration, the stress 
dependence of W and τe are much smaller in 
comparison, and are neglected [9,10]. Therefore, 
the energy bandgap narrowing (widening) 
induced by compressive (tensile) stress causes an 
exponential increase (decrease) in the intrinsic 
carrier concentration, which explains the 
increase (decrease) of the overall junction 
leakage current under uniaxial compressive 
(tensile) stress [9–11].
