100? for 5 minutes and then the samples were annealed in a 
furnace at 450? for four hours. The patterns of capacitance 
were defined on top of the porous dielectric film by 
photolithography. Displacing the porous dielectric film by Cu 
was carried out by immersing the samples in an aqueous 
reaction bath at room temperature for 10 min. The aqueous 
reaction bath contained CuSO4 (0.5M) and diluted HF (0.3M) 
and was mixed in a Teflon beaker with D.I water. Finally, the 
photoresistance (PR) was stripped. The backside of the silicon 
wafer was etched by HF to remove the native oxide and then 
thermally coated with aluminum. Thermal annealing in pure 
H2 at 500°C for 50 min was utilized in an attempt to reduce 
the resistance of the Cu films.  
For measuring capacitances, a Keithley model 82 CV 
meter was used. The frequency and oscillation level were 
1MHz and 100mV, respectively. The dielectric constant was 
calculated from the capacitors, the film thickness, and the area 
of the electrode. The leakage current density of the films was 
determined from the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics 
measured by a HP 4156 semiconductor parameter analyzer. 
The film thickness was measured from a cross-section by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Surface roughness was 
examined by an atomic force microscope (AFM). The 
chemical structure of the porous SiO2 film was examined by 
Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
For the underlayer, HF was used for conjunction with 
colloidal-related chemistry to create surface active sites that 
adsorb positively charged metal ions onto a negatively 
charged low-k dielectric film. This was followed by a 
reduction to neutral atoms. The activated surface was then 
catalytic for deposition of Cu in a displacement process. 
Because TEOS was used as the silica source, dangling bonds 
of Si were formed on the surface of the porous dielectric films. 
This resulted in a thin and very stable oxide layer which can 
be dissolved in concentrated HF. Thus, the oxide layer is 
expected to play a key role in determining the energetics and 
kinetics of the copper deposition onto the dielectric layer. 
Since the aqueous reaction bath contained H2O, CuSO4 and 
HF, the surface of the dielectric films was easily transformed 
into a SiO2 film thereby releasing electrons in the solution. 
The Si oxidation resulted in the formation of SiO2 through the 
following reaction equation: 
Si + 2H2O → SiO2 + 4H+ + 4e- 
 
When SiO2 films are dissolved by HF in the aqueous, F- ions 
released from HF break the Si-O bond and stabilizes the 
oxidized Si4+ ions by forming soluble SiF62- ions. Meanwhile, 
the Cu2+ ions from CuSO4 will receive the electrons, be 
reduced to Cu atoms, and be deposited on the dielectric layer. 
The above redox reaction can be expressed in the following 
equation: 
2Cu2+?Si + 6F- → SiF62-?2Cu 
Once a sizable population of copper nuclei exists, further 
deposition occurs predominantly on existing nuclei, because 
the reduction of cupric ions at the Si/HF interface occurs 
much more slowly than the reduction of the metal/HF. 
Conditions which accelerate Si dissolution will, therefore, 
enhance the rate of precipitation. 
Because the electrons for Si atoms were not completely 
combined with Cu2+ ions, the ratio of displacement of Cu to Si 
was not 2?1. After the reaction, the original thickness of 
90~100 nm of the porous dielectric film had increased to 150 
nm due to the Cu layer. Figure 2 and 3 show two samples of 
three-dimensional AFM images and a SEM micrograph of the 
capacitor, respectively. The thickness of the dielectric film 
was 330~350 nm and the contact metal (150 nm) was 
deposited either by sputtering or a displacement process. The 
porous dielectric film annealed in a furnace at 450? for four 
hours had a mean roughness (Ra) of only 2.788 nm. Figure 2b 
shows the Cu film when deposited by sputtering on the porous 
dielectric film. Figure 2c shows the Cu displaced directly on 
the porous dielectric film. The roughness of the displaced Cu 
was 4.121 nm, thus it was higher than the roughness of the 
sputtered Cu (Ra=3.318nm). Pull-off adhesion test were 
carried out to evaluate the displaced copper films. The 
adhesion on the porous dielectric film passed the tape-pulling 
test and the adhesion strength measured by stud-pulling was 
18.2 kg/cm2. 
Tables I and II show the k values of the dielectric films 
prepared in solutions with different molar ratios and a film 
with Cu deposited by sputtering or in a displacement process, 
respectively. The leakage current densities of the films 
prepared with different amounts of Tween 80 are shown in 
Figure 4. Regardless of the deposition process used the 
leakage current densities did not change significantly with an 
increase in the molar ratios of Tween 80/TEOS. The leakage 
current densities of the Cu films procured by the displacement 
process were higher compared to those obtained by the 
sputtering process. This is because the displacement process is 
an electroless reaction that makes the interface between the 
Cu/dielectric rougher, which the sputtering process results in a 
smoothes interface. 
In the coating solution, the molar ratios of 
TEOS/HCl/H2O/ethanol were maintained at 1/0.2/4/8.5, 
respectively. After calcination, it was expected that the pore 
volume in the film would increase if the amount of Tween 80 
in the solution was increased, and that the dielectric constant 
of the film would drop. However, it was found that the 
dielectric constants were around 1.8 and did not change 
significantly when the amount of Tween 80 was changed. The 
major pore size of the samples was about 36Å, which 
corresponds to the size of mesopores. Approximately 85% of 
the pore volume consisted of these mesopores. This suggests 
that the films were composed of pores of uniform size 
distribution. In addition, when the amount of Tween 80 was 
increased, the surface areas of the films were increased; 
however, the pore volumes remained almost the same. 
Therefore, it can be inferred that if the concentration of Tween 
80 is too high the pores in the samples collapse during the 
calcination process. This may explain why the dielectric 
constants in the films were not changed when a higher amount 
of Tween 80 was added to the solution. 
It is known that in a sol-gel process under an acidic 
environment, water is the reactant for the hydrolysis of TEOS 
to form silanol. Later silanol is polycondensed to form a SiO2 
framework and water molecules. Acid is the catalyst for both 
 4
porous dielectric film with Cu. By tuning the parameters 
Tween 80, TEOS, HCl, H2O of the coating solution, the 
dielectric constant can be controlled in the range of 1.44-1.82. 
The leakage current densities may be reduced to a 10-7 A/cm2 
order or even lower in an electric field of 5MV/cm. After the 
displacement process, the electrical resistivity of the displaced 
copper films can be lowered to 2.04 µΩ-cm by annealing in 
H2 at 500°C for 50 minutes. The effect of the HF 
concentration on the thermal stability was proofed by the BTS 
test.
