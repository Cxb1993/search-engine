Introduction 
Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is water-soluble, biodegradable. It is attractive for 
environmentally friendly products. There are a large amount of studies on the 
adsorption of PVA onto solid surfaces. Silylle (2002), Schultless and Tokunaga (1996), 
Bajpai and Vishwakarma (2003), studied the adsorption isotherms of PVA on to solid 
surfaces. The interactions and adhesive forces between PVA and solid surfaces were 
measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) recently, for examples Uner et al 
(2006), and Yoichi Kanda et al (1999). Effects of PVA on the germination of plants’ 
seeds have been studied in agricultural applications for a long time. Barry et al (1991), 
Lee and Kim (2001), Sarma and Nagarajarao (1981) gave some research results. The 
aging of PVA in the environment was also an important topic. Emo Chiellini et al 
(2003), Jiri Pseja et al (2006), Imam (2005), Emo Chillini et al (2000) studied the 
biodegradation of PVA. In this study experiments on PVA aging by heat and UV light 
were conducted and measured with FTIR. Adhesive forces between PVA and solid 
surfaces were measured with AFM. SEM picture were used to observe the binding 
phenomena of PVA and solids.

2-2 Experiment procedures  
a. Preparation of PVA film 
a-1 Mixing 3g PVA solid with 97 ml pure water (R＞18MΩ). Heating and stirring 
the mixture until the PVA solid dissolves completely. 
a-2 Cooling the solution and taking some drops of the solution on glass. The 
solution drops spread. The spreading film was kept in room temperature for 
air-drying for 24 hours. 
b. Preparation of PVA-SiO2 mixtures 
b-1 1 g of PVA was added to 20g of pure water. Heating and stirring the mixture 
until the PVA solid dissolves completely. 
Interaction between PVA and soils was also conducted in this work. Figure 11 is 
the SEM picture of the mixture of soils and PVA. It was kept in room temperature. 
PVA adheres well to soils in this picture. The sample in figure 11 was heated to 100℃ 
for 3 hours. With the loss of water and the polymerization of PVA, soils and PVA had 
better bonding than that of mixtures kept in room temperature. 
Conclusions 
PVA films and PVA-silica mixtures were prepared in this study. Both samples 
were treated with heat and UV to observe their properties change. Increase in 
temperature and treated with UV light will induce polymerization occurs. SEM 
pictures gave the evidence. AFM scanning showed that UV light makes the 
polymerization more complete. FTIR spectrum depicted that both heat and UV light 
would change the absorption in C-O spectrum region. It is believed that PVA will age 
by heat and UV light. AFM was used to get the interaction force between PVA and 
solid. The higher the temperature, the greater the adhesive force. Lower water content 
and larger PVA molecules are the possible answer for this result. Experimental results 
showed that PVA adhered to soils well. Soils and PVA had better bonding than that of 
mixtures kept in room temperature.
