ror correcting code on the design of distributed classification algorithm can
robustify the system performance.
The DCFECC approach only consider the hard decision decoding scheme.
In [7], an suboptimal DCSD approach has been proposed to extend the
DCFECC scheme to the soft decision decoding. It was also shown in [7],
the DCSD approach provides good fault-tolerance capability if several sensor
faults that are unknown to the fusion center are present.
However, there are still some other soft decision rules left for exploration.
Our aim of this report is to develop these fusion rules and investigate them.
We propose two new fusion rules in this report including the optimal MAP
fusion rule and the suboptimal minimum Euclidean distance (MED) fusion
rule and compare them to the suboptimal DCSD fusion rule given in [7].
Under the minimization of error probability criterion, it is obviously that the
optimal MAP fusion rule should provide the best classification performance.
Therefore, the goal of our performance evaluation is to investigate which
fusion rule provides better fault-tolerance capability when sensor faults occur,
and how much performance degradation of the suboptimal fusion rules have
when compared to the optimal MAP fusion rule in the fault-free situation.
Notably, the MED fusion rule requires only channel statistic information,
while the optimal fusion rule and DCSD rule requires complete knowledge
regarding the channel statistic and the local sensor classification performance.
Our simulation results show that, the optimal fusion rule enjoys the best
performance in fault-free situation as our expected. It also gives the best per-
formance when the observation signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and the channel
signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR) are low. In this report, OSNR means the mea-
surement SNR at sensor nodes, while CSNR represents the SNR of communi-
cation channel between all nodes to the fusion center. DCSD rule, however,
has better fault-tolerance capability in the middle to high range of our con-
sidered OSNR points and at high CSNR points. The MED fusion rule can
perform better than the optimal fusion rule if the number of presented faulty
nodes is large. However, it has much performance loss as compared with the
other rules when the sensor fault is absent or not many.
The report is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the
distributed classification problem. In Section 3, we derive the optimal MAP
fusion rule, briefly introduce the suboptimal DCSD fusion rule proposed in
[7], and propose suboptimal MED fusion rule based on part heuristic. Perfor-
mance evaluation is contained in Section 4. Finally, we provide our conclusion
in Section 5

outputs corresponding to the classified hypotheses at the jth sensor. That is,
if the jth sensor makes a local decision in favor of H`, it transmits a binary
decision whose value equals c`,j. Therefore, based on our model, we have
Pr{xj = −1|Hi} =
∑M−1
`=0 c`,jh`|i and Pr{xj = 1|Hi} =
∑M−1
`=0 c`,jh`|i.
We assume that binary antipodal signalling is employed for transmission.
We assume that the channel are flat fading due to the fact that low bit rate
and short range are used in most WSN. Moreover, the assumption of phase
coherent reception is made in this report. Therefore, the effect of fading
channels is then results in a real vector {yj}Nj=1 at the input to the fusion
center, and yj can be expressed as
yj = αjxj
√
Eb + nj,
where αj is the attenuation factor that models the fading channel, Eb is the
energy per channel bit, and nj is a noise sample from a Gaussian process
with single-sided power spectral density N0 (variance of nj is N0/2).
Our objective now is then to investigate the fusion rules f
({yj}Nj=1) given
the local decision rules associated to an employed code C that can determine
which hypothesis is true with good performance when the sensor networks
are in the absence of sensor faults and in the presence of faulty sensors.
3 The design of fusion rule
Assume that the M × N employed code C is obtained and the local deci-
sion rules associated with C is given, the optimal MAP fusion rule and the
other two suboptimal fusion rules are presented in this section. As men-
tioned earlier, the MED fusion rule requires minimum a priori information,
i.e., channel statistic, while the optimal fusion rule and DCSD rule requires
additional knowledge of local sensor classification performance.

where Pr(yj|xj) can be obtained from the statistical model of the fading
channel, cj = s, s ∈ {0, 1} is the event when the jth sensor decides to transmit
s as bit j of a N bits constructed codeword, and Pr(xj|cj) is given by
Pr(xj|cj) = Pr(xj, cj)
Pr(cj)
=
∑M−1
i=0 Pr(Hi) Pr(xj, cj|Hi)∑M−1

[

. (3)
Observe that Pr(xj|cj) is the average probability of the Pr(xj|Hi) in the set
of ci,j = cj at the jth sensor. Therefore, DCSD is a suboptimal fusion rule
in the sense of the minimization of error probability.
3.3 Minimum Euclidean distance fusion rule
Heuristically, we may relieve the required information of local classification
performance at fusion center to avoid the sensitivity of WSN when the sensor
faults occur. We could start this by assuming that the local classification is
adequately accurate, i.e., Pr{xj = (−1)c`,j |H`} À Pr{xj 6= (−1)c`,j |H`} for
all 1 ≤ j ≤ N . The local sensor classification rule can then be approximated
by Pr{xj = (−1)c`,j |H`} ≈ 1 and Pr{xj 6= (−1)c`,j |H`} ≈ 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤
N . Correspondingly, the optimal MAP fusion rule can be approximated by
making the decision H` if, for all ck ∈ C,
N∏
j=1
Pr (yj|xj = (−1)c`,j) ≥
N∏
j=1
Pr (yj|xj = (−1)ck,j) (4)
Taking the logarithm on both sides of the above equation, we have, for all
ck ∈ C,
N∑

Pr (yj|xj = (−1)c`,j)
Pr (yj|xj = (−1)ck,j) ≥ 0 (5)

evaluation with stuck-at faults, we assume that the faulty nodes are randomly
picked from the 10 deployed nodes and they always send decision 1 to the
fusion center.
In Figs. 2 and 3, we show the performance comparison of all aforemen-
tioned fusion rules with the fixed CSNR at 5 dB and the alterant OSNR
ranging from 0 dB to 12 dB. From Fig. 2, when local sensors are in a fault-
free state, the optimal fusion rule has the best performance among all three
rules. The suboptimal DCSD rule achieves better performance than the other
suboptimal fusion rule, i.e., the MED rule. This can be justified from the
fact that the MED rule is derived by ignoring the knowledge of local clas-
sification performance. From Fig. 3, when one faulty sensor is present, the
DCSD rule has best performance in the high OSNR, while the optimal fusion
rule still gives us the best performance in low OSNR. A possible reason for
this phenomenon is that the error resulting from one faulty sensor is smaller
than the error resulting from the overall decision error of the network at low
OSNR. In other words, the decision errors dominate the system performance
at low OSNR. When two faulty nodes are present in our simulated WSN, it
is easy to see from Fig. 3 that the DCSD provides the most fault-tolerant
performance at the middle to high OSNR range.
Fig. 4 presents the simulated performance when the number of faulty
nodes further increases to 3. It is easy to see that the MED rule becomes
better than the optimal fusion rule in high OSNR. This figure also shows
that the DCSD still possesses the best fault-tolerance capability at most
considered OSNR range. However, at low OSNR, optimal fusion rule achieves
the best performance among all three rules.
Repeating the simulation of the error probability of fault-free case, two
faulty nodes, and three faulty nodes as in Figs. 2, 3 and 4 but fixing the
CSNR at 0 dB , we show, in Figs. 5 and 6, the OSNR range in which
the optimal fusion rule provides the best performance increases to the higher

5 Conclusion
In this report, we studied the soft fusion rules using coding approach for
wireless sensor networks. We derived the optimal MAP fusion rule and the
suboptimal minimum Euclidean distance fusion rule. We compared the per-
formance of these two fusion rules to that of the DCSD fusion rule proposed
in our earlier work by simulation. We showed that the optimal MAP fusion
rule gives the better classification performance in fault-free environments as
well as in the faulty situation when the OSNR or CSNR is low. Simulation
results also showed that, when the sensor faults are present, DCSD fusion
rule can robustify the system performance in the middle to high OSNR range
and at high CSNR points. Furthermore, minimum Euclidean distance fusion
rule only performs better than the optimal fusion rule when many sensor
faults occur and OSNR is high. This work allows us to choose suitable fusion
rules for coding approach in sensor networks.
