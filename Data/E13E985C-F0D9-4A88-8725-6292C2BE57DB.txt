英文摘要
CIS thin films formed on several patterned structures, etched cavities and trenches, are studied.
The structural influences on CuInSe2 (CIS) film formation and film texture are reported. The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) results show that as the spacing between cavities or trenches decreases, the XRD
intensity ratio of CIS I(220/204) to that of I(112) increases. For a fixed spacing, CIS film formed on
Mo/SLG with cavities has a higher intensity ratio than that on trenches. The surface morphology of
the CIS film is also strongly influenced by the structural patterns. Substrate texturing also affects
the preferred phase formation of In2Se3. Mo/SLG substrates with patterned cavities can eliminate
In2Se3 (006) formation. Formation of In2Se3 (110), (202) and (300) phases can be achieved using
Mo/SLG substrate with any of the patterned structures studied.

報告內容
We proposed a three-year funding project but only one-year fund was granted. Therefore, we
execute the first part of this project “preferred grain orientation and cel (substrate) structure related 
experiments”.
(The result has been published in IEEE PVSC35 conference on June, 2010 Hawaii, USA )
Experimental and results of this project follows:
INFLUENCES OF THE SUBSTRATE STRUCTURE ON THE GROWTH OF
CuInSe2 and In2Se3THIN FILMS
INTRODUCTION
CuInSe2 (CIS)-based thin films have received considerable attention as one of the most
promising materials for thin film solar cells due to their low cost and high absorption coefficient.
4and surface morphology of the films were observed using a Hitachi S-4100 scanning electron
microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 15 keV. The compositions of the films were
measured with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) unit attached to the SEM.
Structural evolutions and phase identifications of the films were examined with a SHIMADZU
7000S X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å and a scan range 
(2θ) from 20° to 60°. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 1 lists the mask patterns used for substrate patterning. Both large features with wide spacing
and small features with narrow spacing are included to study their influence on the films.
Table 1 Dimension of the mask patterns used for substrate patterning.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the two-step selenized CIS films with different substrate
patterns are shown in Figure 1. Their intensity ratios (R) =I(220/204)/I(112) are given next to the
pattern ID. We have observed a general trend: as the spacing between cavities or trenches decreases,
the value of R increases. For cavities and trenches with the same spacing, the R value for the former
is higher than that for the latter. The influence of patterned structures on CIS film growth was
examined by comparing these samples to the NP sample.
The XRD graphs of the CIS film grown on SLG with micro-cavities or narrow trenches are shown
in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively.

6Figure 3: Surface morphology of the CIS film formed on Mo coated SLG substrates with (a)
no pattern, (b) 2A pattern, and (c) 3B pattern.
To simplify the analysis of what cause the minor change in preferred growth, co-evaporation of In
and Se onto Mo coated and patterned SLG with a substrate temperature of 400 oC was investigated.
Figure 4 shows the XRD results for the In2Se3 films formed on the patterned SLG substrates. The
patterned structure had a strong influence on the preferred growth of In2Se3 film. In2Se3 (110), (202),
and (300) were the preferred orientations when it formed on substrate with 3x3 um cavities (pattern
2B in Fig. 4a). The (110) and (300) preferred orientations of the In2Se3 film could promote
subsequent CIS films grown with a (220/204) preferred orientation [13]. The cavities suppressed
(006) and promoted (110) and (300) formation of the In2Se3 film. This effect is similar to forming
In2Se3 film using higher Se flux [7]. In contrast, In2Se3 film formed on flat substrate resulted in (006)
preferred orientation which could promote CIS(112) growth [7, 13]. In2Se3 film grew on substrate
with cavities but without Mo film also yielded (006) preferred orientation. Without Mo, sodium can
easily diffused to CIS film during the selenization. However, (110) and (300) peaks co-existed with
(006) for an In2Se3 film grew in smaller cavities (2x2 um, pattern P1 in Fig.4b). The data indicates
that sodium has a strong influence on promoting (006) growth. The cavities’ influence on promoting 
In2Se3 (110) and (300) growth increases with smaller cavity size.

CONCLUSIONS
Patterned substrate structures or Mo surfaces are not only likely to improve the performance of
solar cells by reflecting the unabsorbed light back to the absorber layer, but could also promote CIS
(220/204) grain growth, which can reduce the number of non-radiative recombination centers as
compared to (112)-oriented films. XRD results show that the CIS film texture was modified when
Cu/In was deposited and selenized on a SLG substrate with cavity or trench patterns. As the spacing
between cavities or trenches decreases, the intensity ratio of CIS I(220/204) to I(112) increases. For

2reported and revealed. Since my research area is focus on CIGS thin film solar cells and related
materials, my report will be only on some good papers and technologies related to CIGS area.
A plenary talk from SoloPower inc. impressed me most, because this company reported
what my Lab was doing. My Lab’s current developments (our co-development project with
Delsolar) are pretty much same as theirs: flexible CIGS thin film solar cells with precursors
deposit by electro-plating followed by selenization or annealing. The roll-to-roll type processing
for manufacturing CIGS solar cells has been revealed. The figure below is the schematic of the
system. This figure is same as the patent they applied for.
Although the detailed process may not be exactly same as the figure shown but it clearly
indicate how they execute the roll to roll process. One thing I learned and surprised me was
SoloPower use a conditioning Mo process to make sure the Mo film is identical before the foil
enters the Cu plating unit. Their concern is that Cu plating at the beginning on the Mo surface is
very different from Cu plating at the end of a long stainless steel foil. Without conditioning Mo
surface, Cu plating on Mo layer is no robust and could result in plating variation. For people
familiar with CIGS process, element’s uniform deposition is extremely important to film growth
as well as its film quality. Large composition variation is a killer for CIGS absorber film process
yield. One other thing that I have learned is that SoloPower Inc. is also put a protection layer on
the backside of the conducting foils (such as stainless steel foil). The materials of this protecting
layer need be insensitive to selenization, i.e. it will not react with Se in an ideal case. The reason
of using this protecting layer is that the iron selenide could form after selenization and soldering
from backside to frontside, used for cells interconnect, is not possible because of this selenide.
This know-how is the most precious for this trip. Delsolar and my Lab is working on the same
development, it helps to foresee the possible issues and provides us a shorter learning cycle.
