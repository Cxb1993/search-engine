2T-S fuzzy model is a nonlinear system. However, from the
viewpoint of conditional expectation, we shall show that the
state estimation problem for the stochastic T-S fuzzy model with
state-dependent noise can be viewed as a linear state estimation
problem. For state estimation of linear systems, the Kalman
filter is an unbiased and minimum variance estimator under
the Gaussian assumption. Based on the above observation, we
shall derive the optimal fuzzy Kalman filter for the considered
stochastic T-S fuzzy system under Gaussian assumption.
This study is organized as follows. Related materials of
probability are introduced in Section II. In Section III, the
considered stochastic T-S fuzzy model with state-dependent
noise is described. In Section IV, a class of standard state
estimators for the considered stochastic fuzzy systems is pre-
sented and analysis of mean square of estimation error is
made. The optimal H∞ fuzzy filter is discussed in Section V.
The optimal fuzzy Kalman filter under Gaussian assumption is
studied in Section VI. Simulation study is made in Section VII.
Conclusions and discussions are given in Section VIII.
Notations
1) For a random vector x, its covariance matrix is denoted by
Σx with Σx = E
©
(x− xˆ)(x− xˆ)T
ª
, where xˆ = E {x}
is the ensemble mean.
2) Let x, y, and z be three random vectors. The conditional
expectation of x given y is denoted by E {x|y} . The
conditional covariance of x given z is defined as
Σx,x|z = E
©
(x−E {x|z})(x−E {x|z})T |zª
The conditional cross-covariance of x and y given z is
defined as
Σx,y|z = E

(x−E {x|z})(y −E {y|z})T |zª
Similarly, the conditional covariance of x given y and z
is defined as
Σx,x|y, z = E

(x−E {x|y, z})(x−E {x|y, z})T |y, zª
3) For a vector x and a matrix A, kxk is the Euclidean
norm of x and kAk is the associated matrix induced norm.
The minimal and maximal eigenvalues of A with only
real eigenvalues are denoted as λmin (A) and λmax (A),
respectively. For a random vector x and a deterministic or
random matrix A, the norm kAkms is defined as kAk2ms

II. PRELIMINARY MATERIALS OF CONDITIONAL
PROBABILITY
In this section, we summarize some basic materials concern-
ing conditional probability, which will be used in the derivation
of the optimal fuzzy Kalman filter. Most of the materials
presented in this section are extracted from [13].
Let zη be the σ-algebra generated by the random variable η
and let E {x} exist. Let {zi}∞i=1 be a set of nondecreasing
σ-algebras. Some properties of conditional expectation are
summarized in the following:
1) E {E {x|z1}} = E {x} .
2) If x is z1−measurable, |x| <∞ a.s., and E {|y| |z1} <
∞ a.s., then E
©
xT y|z1
ª
= xTE {y|z1} a.s.
3) If z1 ⊂ z2 ⊂ z, then E {E {x|z2} |z1} = E {x|z1} .
The concept of conditional independence is introduced below.
Definition 1: Random vectors x and y are called condition-
ally independent given z if

where E
n
eiλ
Tx|z
o
and E
n
eiμ
T y|z
o
are the conditional char-
acteristic functions of x and y, respectively.
Lemma 1: (Theorem 1.10 in [13]) (i) If y and
£
xT zT
¤T
are independent, then x and y are conditionally independent
given z. (ii) If x and y are conditionally independent given z,
then for any Borel set B,
P ({x ∈ B} |y, z) = P ({x ∈ B} |z)
and
E {x|y, z} = E {x|z}
Definition 2: Let |x| <∞ a.s. Then x is called conditionally
Gaussian given y if there exist an zy-measurable random vector
xˆ and an zy-measurable random matrix Σ = ΣT ≥ 0 a.s.
such that the conditional characteristic function of x given y is
expressed by

for every constant vector λ. In this case
xˆ = E {x|y} , Σ = E
n

Note that if x is conditionally Gaussian given y and A (·) as
well as b (·) are Borel measurable functions with almost surely
kA (y)k < ∞ and kb (y)k < ∞, then it follows that A(y)x +
b(y) is also conditionally Gaussian given y.
Lemma 2: If random variable x is independent of random
variables y and z, then
E {xy|z} = E {x}E {y|z}
Proof: Since x is independent of y and z, it follows
fxy|z (x, y|z) = fx (x) fyz (y, z)fz (z) = fx (x) fy|z (y|z)
and thus
E {xy|z} =

Lemma 3: Suppose that the zero-mean random variables q1,
q2, and the random vector v are mutually independent
and are all independent of x and z. Also assume
that A (·) , b (·) , ∆A(·), ∆C(·), and ∆b(·) are Borel
measurable functions with almost surely kA (α)k < ∞,
kb (α)k < ∞, k∆A (α)k < ∞, k∆C (α)k < ∞, and
k∆b (α)k < ∞. If x is conditionally Gaussian given
4IV. A CLASS OF STANDARD STATE ESTIMATORS FOR
STOCHASTIC FUZZY SYSTEMS
With the T-S fuzzy system in (7), a class of standard state
estimators, which are extensively used in the literature such as
[8], [14], and [11], is given by

(14)
where the filter gain Li is related to the local linear model in the
i-th rule. With the fuzzy system in (11) and the state estimator
in (14), the state estimation error x˜k+1 = xk+1 − xˆk+1 can be
expressed as
x˜k+1

With the fuzzy system in (8) and the state estimation error in
(15), the overall state-space model with the augmented state
vector x¯k =
£
xTk+1 x˜
T

x¯k+1 = F˜ij(k)x¯k + ηk+1 (16)

Before deriving the mean-square stability result for the forced
stochastic fuzzy dynamic equation (16), we shall first consider
the following unforced stochastic fuzzy system
x¯k+1 = F˜ij(k)x¯k (17)
A sufficient condition concerning the mean-square exponential
stability of the unforced system (17) is given in the following
theorem.

By Schur complement, (20) is equivalent to (18). This com-
pletes the proof.
Theorem 1: If there exist symmetric positive definite matri-
ces P1 and P2 such that the matrix inequalities (18) hold for λ1
and λ2 with 0 ≤ λ1, λ2 < 1, then the stochastic fuzzy system
(17) is mean square exponentially stable with

as λ = max(λ1, λ2), λminp = min
1≤i≤2
(λmin (Pi)) and λmaxp =

hold for 1 ≤ i ≤ L and 1 ≤ j ≤ L, then the suboptimal
H∞ control performance in (31) is attained and the observer
gain matrix Li is obtained via the equation Ki = P2Li, i.e.,
Li = P−12 Ki.
Proof: Let us choose a Lyapunov function for the system
(30) as
V (x¯k) = E{x¯Tk Px¯k} (34)
where P is a positive definite matrix. By the Lyapunov function,
we obtain

the proof is complete.
With the above lemma, the optimal Kalman filter algorithm

Theorem 4: For the stochastic fuzzy system in (11) with
assumptions (A1)-(A4), the state xk is conditionally Gaussian
given Yk = [y0, y1, · · · , yk], with conditional mean xˆk and con-

The related one-step ahead prediction xˆk+1|k , E {xk+1|Yk}
is
xˆk+1|k = Akxˆk +Bkuk (52)
and the prediction error covariance matrix
E{(xk+1 −E {xk+1|Yk}) (xk+1 −E {xk+1|Yk})T |Yk} is
equal to Rk.
Proof: Using Lemma 5, by identifying z with Yk, y with
yk+1, and x with xk+1 in Lemma 7, we obtain
E {xk+1|Yk, yk+1}
= E {xk+1|Yk+1}
= E {xk+1|Yk}+Σxy|zΣ+yy|z (yk+1 −E {yk+1|Yk}) a.s.

1) Conventional State Observer Design: For the standard
state observer given in (14), the main work is to solve the LMI
(18) to find the local observer gain matrix Li for the i-th rule of
the fuzzy observer. We set λ1 = 0.8, λ2 = 0.8, and Q1 as well
as Q2 are both identity matrices. We solve the linear matrix
inequality (18) by using the Matlab LMI Toolbox to obtain the
observer gain matrices as
L1 =

Note that the standard state observer given in (14) is a
prediction-type estimator given by
xˆk+1 = Akxˆk +Bkuk +
9X
i=1
hi (zk)Li (yk − Ck−1xˆk) (60)
With the same observer gain matrices Li, we can also construct
a filtering-type estimator as follows
xˆk+1 = Akxˆk +Bkuk
+
9X
i=1
hi (zk)Li (yk+1 − CkAkxˆk − CkBkuk)
(61)
which is expected to have better estimation performance than
the prediction-type estimator as the additional information yk+1
is used.
2) Optimal H∞ Filter Design: For the optimal H∞ filter
design, we solve the LMI’s in (32) and (33). The minimal value
of ρ is ρ = 5.9648,

and the observer gain matrices are

Note that the considered optimal H∞ filter in Section V is of
prediction type. As discussed in the previous section, we can
also construct a filtering-type estimator related to the optimal
H∞ filter.
3) The Optimal Fuzzy Kalman Filter: We shall simulate both
the filtering-type optimal fuzzy Kalman filter in (45)-(50) and
the prediction-type one in (52). The initial condition of the
conditional covariance matrix Σk is given by
Σ0 = 2× 103 ×
∙
1 0
0 1
¸
4) Comparison of Estimation Performance: The standard
fuzzy estimator, the optimal H∞ fuzzy filter, and the optimal
Kalman fuzzy filter of both prediction type and filtering type
will be compared by verifying the standard deviation σx of the
state estimation error by counting 10000 sample points. For
the three estimators of filtering type, estimations of x1(t) and
x2(t) of the stochastic T-S fuzzy system are shown in Fig. 2
(a) and Fig.3 (a), respectively. The related estimation errors are
shown in Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 3(b). While for the three estimators
of prediction type, estimations of x1(t) and x2(t) are shown
in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. The standard deviations of
estimation errors of these estimators are compared in Table I.
In this table, it is shown that all the filtering-type estimators
outperform the prediction-type ones. In the class of filtering-
type estimators, the standard deviation of the estimation error
for the optimal Kalman fuzzy filter is much less than those of
the other two filters. However, the performances of the filtering-
type estimators are very close.
Now we turn to evaluate the robustness of the three esti-
mators. Note that the designs of the standard fuzzy estimator
and the H∞ fuzzy optimal estimator are irrelevant to Rv and
Rw. Here, the optimal Kalman fuzzy filter will be computed
