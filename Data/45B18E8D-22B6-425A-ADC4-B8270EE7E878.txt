Abstract 
There is a growing requirement for improved heat transfer performance for a number of electronic devices and this dictates a need to 
further elevate the endwall heat transfer performances for pin-fin channels.  Driven by this need, a novel compound heat transfer 
enhancement (HTE) measure that combines deepened scales and pin-fin array is devised. Characteristics of heat transfer and 
pressure drop performances in two scale-roughened pin-fin channels with two different pin pitch-to-diameter ratios are compared for 
both forward and backward flows in the Reynolds Number (Re) range of 1000-30000. Comparisons of heat transfer data, pressure 
drop measurements and thermal performance factors with previous results collected from a variety of single and compound HTE 
devices demonstrate the significant augmentations in both heat transfer rates and pressure drop coefficients for the present HTE 
measure. This present compound HTE measure with scales and pin-fin array demonstrates an enhancement on the heat transfer up to 
of 22 times of the developed flow references in smooth-walled pipe within the Re range of 1000-30000. Experimental correlations of 
heat transfer and pressure-drop coefficients for two scale-roughened pin-fin channels with forward and backward flows are derived 
to assist design applications.

the ambient temperature level. The test airflow was channeled through a set of pressure regulator and filter (3), a needle valve (4), a 
mass flow meter (5) and a pressure transducer (6) through which the pressure and the mass flow rate of the test coolant entering the 
pin-fin test channel (7) was adjusted and measured. The pin-fin test channel (7) was 240mm 80mm 40mm in dimension with two 
opposite walls roughened by deepened scales. The aspect ratio (H/W) and the hydraulic diameter of the rectangular test channel 
were 1/2 and 53 mm, respectively. The pressurized airflow was fed into a 240mm 80mm 80mm plenum chamber (8) prior to 
entering the test channel. The cross-sectional area ratio between the plenum chamber and the test channel was 2 that simulated the 
abrupt entry condition. As the electrical heating also commenced at the immediate flow entrance, the hydraulic and thermal 
boundary layers were developed simultaneously at the flow entrance. A K-type thermocouple penetrated into the core of the plenum 
chamber adjacent to the entry plane of the test channel to detect the coolant entry temperature which was constantly used to calculate 
the fluid properties at the flow entrance for evaluating Reynolds (Re) and Prandtl (Pr) numbers there. The calculation procedure for 
assessing the fluid bulk temperatures (Tb) at locations corresponding to the axial spots where the wall temperatures (Tw) were 
measured was conducted using the sequential enthalpy balance method. Three type K thermocouples with equal spanwise interval 
penetrated into the core of the convergent exit chamber (9) adjacent to the exit plane of the test channel to measure local exit fluid 
temperatures. The exit fluid temperature was obtained by averaging the three thermocouple measurements and used to compare with 
the calculated Tb at the channel exit during the stage of data acquisition in order to constantly check the accuracy of energy 
conservation. Raw data batch was accepted for subsequent data processing when the differences between the measured and 
calculated Tb at the exit plane of the test channel were less than 8%.  
 
The geometrical details of pin-fin array and the scale-roughened endwalls are depicted in Fig. 1-b. As indicated, the surface 
topologies encountered by the forward and backward flows over the scale-roughened surface are different so that the heat transfer 
and pressure drop in such a scale-roughened channel depend on the direction of main flow [17]. The coordinate systems for the 
forward and backward flows as well as the thermocouple locations for Tw measurements are also indicated in Fig. 1-b.  To 
eliminate the additional fin effects provided by the pin-fin array to reveal the actual endwall heat transfer performances, each pin-fin 
is made of Teflon with thermal conductivity about 0.23 Wm
-1
K
-1
. Each Teflon pin with the height (HP) of 40mm and 5mm in 
diameter (DP) is positioned at the geometric center of each scale imprint to form the V-shaped in-line pin-fin array characterized by 
the following geometrical dimensionless groups: 
 
Skewness of V-shape pin-fin array = 45
0
 
Pin diameter-to-height ratio (HP/DP) = 8 
X-wise pin-pitch to pin-diameter ratio (PP/HP) =3.54 
Skew-wise pin pitch-to-diameter ratio (PS/HP) = 1.4 or 2.8 
Y-wise pin pitch-to-diameter ratio (S/HP) = 1 or 2 
 
Endwall heat transfer performances and pressure drop characteristics for the scale-roughened pin-fin channels are examined for two 
pin-fin arrays with different y-wise (skew-wise) pin pitch-to-diameter ratios of 1 and 2 (1.4 and 2.8). As shown in Fig. 1-b, the 
coherent scale imprints are arranged in the staggered manner and deepened into two opposite channel wide walls characterized by 
four dimensionless geometrical groups of: 
 
Scale angle of penetration (αS) = 11
0
  
Scale height to channel height ratio (eS/H) = 0.025 
Scale pitch-to-height ratio (SP/eS) = 10 
Scale diameter to scale pitch ratio (DS/SP) = 1 
 
Each scale-roughened surface was machined from the stainless steel plate with the thermal conductivity of 15 Wm

 and 
electrically heated by a 0.5mm thick Minco thermal foil. The heating foil was sandwiched between a 25mm thick Teflon plate and 
the stainless steel made heat transfer surface which generated the basically uniform heat flux heating condition.

proportionality between the heat loss flux and the wall-to-ambient temperature difference. The correlation for estimating the heat 
loss flux was accordingly derived and built into the data processing program to determine the local convective heat flux transferred 
by the flow (q). In this respect, local q varied over the scale-roughened endwall as measured wall temperatures (Tw) were not 
uniformly distributed due to the location dependent Nu distributions created by the flow. With a uniform heat flux supplied from the 
Minco thermal foil, the convective heat flux was obtained by subtracting the local heat loss flux from the total heat flux supplied at 
each location where Tw was detected. The review of the entire post-processed q data indicated the maximum non-uniformity in heat 
flux distributions of 8.3 % due to the small amount of external heat loss. 
 
All the temperature measurements were monitored and stored in PC through a Fluke Hydra 
2640A data logger. Tw measurements were corrected into the base-line plane as indicated in Fig. 
1-b using the one dimensional heat conduction equation. Origins of streamwise (x) and spanwise 
(y) coordinate systems for the forward and backward flows were selected at the middle span of 
each entry edge. 
 
Pressure drop tests were carried out separately at isothermal conditions. At each Re tested, the pressure differences across the entire 
test channel in terms of mm-H2O were detected through two flexible tubes connected with the pressure taps of 0.5mm diameter at 
two origins of the coordinate systems specified in Fig. 1-b. Pressure differences between these two taps were measured by a digital 
micromanometer with precision of 0.001 mm-H2O. Such arrangement for pressure drop measurements offered the overall 
assessments for the flow resistance over the entire test channel, which generated the higher pressure drop coefficients than those 
acquired from the developed flow regime. The dimensionless pressure drop over the test channel was evaluated as the Fanning 
friction factors (f) based on the pressure drops (ΔP) across the test channel of length L with mean flow velocity (Wm) as: 
 
f =[ΔP/(0.5ρWm
2
)]/(d/4L)               (3) 
 
2.2 Procedures and data processing 
Heat transfer and pressure drop tests were individually performed with the airflows directed in forward and backward directions at 
Re = 1000, 1500, 2000, 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000. Streamwise centerline Nu distributions along the 
scale-roughened endwall, Nu  and pressure drop coefficients (f) in the tested Re range, which covered both laminar and turbulent 
flows, were examined. The inclination angles of these scale imprints are unidirectional and the V pin-rows were pointed in the 
downstream (upstream) direction for the forward (backward) flows, the performances of heat transfer and pressure drop in the 
present test channel were affected by the direction of main flow. Therefore the Re impacts on local Nu, Nu , pressure drop 
coefficients and thermal performance factors for forward and backward flows are individually examined. The HTE ratios in terms of 
Nu /Nu∞ along with the penalty of augmentations in pressure drops and the thermal performance factors between the present test 
channel and those collected from a variety of enhanced channels were compared. A set of empirical correlations that evaluated Nu  
and f for the present test channel with forward and backward flows were generated to assist engineering applications.  
 
This experimental program performed the steady state heat transfer tests. The steady state was assumed when the Tw variations with 
several successive scans at one detected location were less than 0.3
0
C. The elapsed time to satisfy such steady state assumption 
generally took 30-45 minutes after the heating power or the airflow rate was adjusted. It is worth noting that the various heat fluxes 
fed into the test channel affected Re at the flow entrance even if the airflow rate remained invariant due to the thermal impacts on the 
fluid properties. Adequate adjustments of airflow rate to compensate the variations in fluid properties due to heat transfer were 
constantly performed to keep the maximum differences in Re at the entry plane of the test channel within +1% from the targeting 
value.  
 
The references selected to assess HTE ratios and pressure-drop augmentations in the present scale roughened pin-fin channel were 
those developed in a smooth-walled circular tube with fully developed flow. The referenced Nusselt number (Nu∞) and pressure drop 
coefficient ( f∞) for laminar and turbulent flows are defined in equations (4)-(7). 
 
Nu∞ = 48/11    (laminar pipe flow with uniform heat flux)      (4) 
f∞ = 16/Re     (laminar pipe flow)          (5)

The thermal performance factor (η) based on the constant pumping power consumption is quantified as: 
 
 = ( Nu / Nu∞)/( f / f∞)
1/3
               (8) 
 
The temperature measurements were the major sources for the uncertainties in Nu and Re as the properties of coolant such as 
thermal conductivity and viscosity were evaluated in accordance with the local fluid bulk temperature. Based on the precisions 
provided by the measurement devices, the maximum uncertainties of the derived parameters for constituting the governing 
dimensionless groups are estimated as: heat flux (0.8%), fluid viscosity (0.35%), fluid thermal conductivity (0.28%) and fluid 
 14 
 
It is worth noting that, as each thermocouple is positioned exactly at the midway between two adjacent pin-rows, there is no sign of 
pin-row driven Nu ripples displayed in Fig. 2. But the direction of main flow has profound influences on endwall Nu levels for the 
present test channels with pin-fin arrays. As compared in each plot of Fig.2, the forward flow case consistently shows the higher Nu 
than the backward flow case. Such Nu differences between forward and backward flows are resulted from the subtle differences in 
flow structures between the forward and backward flows over the scale imprints [17,18] even if the agitated vortical flows tripped by 
pin-rows prevail over the entire pin-fin test channel. With forward flows over the present scale-roughened surface, the near-wall 
vortex array plays a significant role for HTE impacts. As such near-wall vortex array and its associated unstable, transient large-scale 
vortices in the scale-roughened channel with forward flows are absent in a similar channel with backward flows [18], the forward 
flow cases consistently provide higher HTE effects than the backward flow counterparts in the scale-roughened channel [17,18] as 
well as in the present scale-roughened pin-fin channel. In this respect for the scale-roughened channel with two pin-fin arrays of 
S/DP=1 and 2, the larger degrees of such forward-to-backward Nu differences, which increase as Re increases, develop in the pin-fin 
channel with S/DP=1. This particular result indicates that the flow interactions between the vortical flows triggered by pin-fin arrays 
and scales are different between the forward and backward flows. But these pin-fins and the scale imprints are unlikely to induce the 
strong cross-plane secondary flows which play the dominant roles for HTE impacts in the channels roughened by angled ribs. Due to 
the lack of strong secondary flows over the cross section of the present scale roughened pin-fin channel in the developed flow 
regions between pin-rows 10-11 and 9-10 for the forward and backward flows respectively, the Nu variations along y/W axis as 
depicted by Fig. 3 are quite uniform. Nevertheless, the Nu values at locations aside y/W=+0.5 in each plot of Fig. 3 are slightly 
reduced from those in the central region due to the thickened boundary layers developed over two channel sidewalls, which has been 
previously reported for the rectangular channel with attached pin-fin arrays [16]. Therefore the considerable heat transfer elevations 
from the Nu∞ references as compared in each plot of Fig. 2 are generated by the compound mechanisms including the boundary 
layer breaking, the near-wall vortices, the enhanced turbulence and the vortical structures evolved from the horseshoe vortices. 
Nevertheless, as each skew-wise thermocouple locates precisely at the midway between two adjacent V pin-rows, there is no y-wise 
Nu ripple shown in Fig. 3. By way of averaging each y-wise Nu profile depicted in Fig. 2 resolves into Nu  representing the 
averaged heat transfer level in the developed flow region at midway locations behind the pin-row.  
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3 Spanwise Nu variations with pin-fin arrays of (a) S/DP=1, forward flow (b) S/DP=2, forward flow (c) S/DP=1, backward 
flow (d) S/DP=2, backward flow at Re = 10000, 20000, 30000. 
 
Fig. 4 depicts the varying trends of Nu  versus Re for forward and backward flows with pin-fin arrays of S/DP=1 and 2. The 
referenced Nusselt numbers (Nu∞) for laminar and turbulent flows over the tested Re range are indicated as the dotted line in Fig. 4 
for comparisons. As compared in Fig. 4, the Nu  obtained with forward flows consistently operate at the higher levels than their 
backward-flow counterparts; while the Nu  obtained with the pin-fin array of S/DP=1 are higher than those obtained with S/DP=2 
for forward or backward flows. All the Re driven Nu  trends displayed in Fig. 4 can be well correlated as Nu =A×Re
n
 in which the 
A coefficient and n exponent vary with the main flow direction and S/DP. The mathematical form of correlation satisfies the limiting 
condition of vanished forced convective capability ( Nu →0) as Re→0. Table 1 compares the A, n values collected from the various 
Nu  correlations derived from the present test channel, the smooth-walled pin-fin channel [16], the scale roughened channel [17] 
and the channel with the compound V-ribs and scales [20]. Among this comparative group, the geometries of surface scales and the 
channel aspect ratios (AR) for the scale roughened channel [17], the present test channel and the channel with compound V-ribs and 
scales [20] are identical so that these results can be compared directly to reveal the impacts of the additional V-ribs and present 
pin-fin arrays on A, n coefficients. However, for the pin-fin channel with smooth endwalls [16], the channel aspect ratio is 4 and the 
x-wise and y-wise pin pitch-to-diameter ratios for the in-line array are 2. As this study is the first time attempt to arrange the 
V-shaped pin-fin array, no direct relevant Nu  data is available for such comparison and the results obtained from the pin-fin 
channel with smooth endwalls [16] mainly serve as references to examine the impacts of scale imprints on n exponents. 
 16 
scale-roughened pin-fin channels with forward and backward flows reach the levels of 8.6-4.98 and 6.7-3.9 with S/DP=1 and 4.8-4.1 
and 3.7-3.4 with S/DP=2. For the present test channels, the descending rates of Nu /Nu∞ against Re with S/DP=1 are faster than 
those with S/DP=2 and than those with compound scales and V-ribs [20]. As a result, Nu /Nu∞ for the channel with compound 
roughness of scales and V-ribs [20] turn to be higher than the Nu /Nu∞ levels in the present pin-fin channel with S/DP=1 when Re 
exceeds 20000. With the compound roughness of scales and V-ribs, the V-ribs induce strong cross-sectional secondary flows 
swirling along the entire channel. While the turbulent eddies induced by the scale imprints [18] are interacting with the secondary 
flows induced by the V-ribs among the channel core, the near-wall vortex array and the turbulence augmentation [18] can still 
prevail over the scaled wall to considerably augment HTE impacts. But with the presence of pin-fin array, the near-wall vortex array 
induced by the scale imprints is constantly distributed by the protruding pin-fins. The strong secondary flows induced by the V-ribs 
are absent in the present test channel. As a result, the Nu /Nu∞ for the channel with compound roughness of scales and V-ribs are 
higher than those for the present study at S/Dp=1 and Re exceeds 20000. Nevertheless, even with S/DP=2 for the present test channel, 
the Nu /Nu∞ ratios indicated in Fig. 5 still exceed the Nu /Nu∞ ratios in the rib-roughened channels [21-23]. Particularly, while the 
Nu /Nu∞ for the smooth-walled pin-fin channels remain in the ranges of 1.8-2.5 [16,24] as seen in Fig. 5, the present 
scale-roughened pin-fin channels significantly enhance the HTE impacts by elevating the Nu /Nu∞ ratios to 5.16-22 in the Re range 
of 1000-30000. The augmentations of HTE impacts by incorporating the scale imprints over the endwalls of the pin-fin channels are 
remarkable. 
 
The increased heat transfer area from the base-line plane by a pin-fin array is significant. This is evaluated as the Effective Area 
Ratio (EAR) in Fig. 5 for each HTE device as the area ratio between the total convective surfaces to the base-plane area. As 
compared in Fig. 5, while the EAR for the ribbed or scale-roughened channels scatter between 1.6-2.5, the EAR for the present 
pin-fin channels with S/DP=1 and 2 reach 8.85 and 5.88 respectively. In view of the heat transfer powers by taking EAR into account 
for comparing the thermal performances offered by the various HTE measures, the high EAR for the pin-fin array can offset the 
increased pressure-drop penalties which will be demonstrated later in the paper. 
 
 
Fig. 5 Comparison of Nu /Nu∞ ratios between various HTE devices. 
 
3.2 f measurements and correlations 
Figures 6-a and 6-b respectively depict f versus Re for the present scale-roughened pin-fin channels with (a) S/DP=1 and (b) S/DP=2. 
Also compared in Fig. 6-b are the experimental data collected from the pin-fin channels with pin pitch-to-diameter ratios of 2 in both 
x and y directions [16,25]. It is worth noting that, for both present scale-roughened pin-fin channels, the x-wise pin pitch-to-diameter 
ratio (PP/DP) is fixed at 3.54 which is larger than the PP/DP ratio of 2 used by [16,25]. But, as compared in Fig. 6-b, the f factors for 
the present test channel with S/DP=2, PP/DP=3.54 are higher than the f values detected from the smooth-walled pin-fin channels with 
S/DP=2, PP/DP=2 [16,25] due to the presence of scale imprints. It is clear that the most of pressure drop in the present 
scale-roughened pin-fin channels arises from the flow resistance through the pin-fin array rather than the scale imprints.  This 
conclusion can be justified by the small f difference between the present data and those reported in [16,25] as compared in Fig. 6-b. 
 18 
the pin-fin array for the present test channels has led to the necessity for comparing the thermal performance factors (η) between the 
various HTE measures.  
 
 
 
Fig. 7 Comparison of f / f∞ ratios between various HTE devices. 
 
 
3.3 Thermal performance factors and EAR effects 
The significant pressure drops incurred by the pin-fin arrays require design considerations. But the considerable increase of 
convective area available in a pin-fin channel can elevate the heat transfer power to large extents even if the higher Nu surrounding 
each pin-fin [3,4] are estimated by the endwall Nu levels. As a conservative measure to determine the performances of heat transfer 
powers attainable from the channels fitted with various HTE devices, Nu  is multiplied by EAR to index the convective capability 
in terms of the transferred thermal power. From this viewpoint, the thermal performances for various HTE devices are evaluated as 
η×EAR. Fig. 8 depicts (a) η (b) η×EAR versus Re for various HTE devices, which compares the two types of thermal performance 
factors between a variety of single and compound HTE measures. 
 
As compared in Fig. 8-a, the η values for the present test channel with S/DP=2 are consistently higher than those detected from the 
test channel with PP/DP=1 due to the lower f/f∞ ratios for both forward and backward flows. Although the Nu /Nu∞ ratios for the 
present test channels soar among the highest levels in Fig. 5, the significant augmentations in f/f∞ due to pin-fin arrays have 
considerably suppressed their thermal performance factors (η) and bring the present test channels down to the lowest values among 
the comparative group collected in Fig. 8. The highest η values emerge for the channel with compound scales and V-ribs [20] as seen 
in Fig. 8. With the exception of the channels enhanced by the scale imprints [17] and the compound scales and V-ribs [20], the 
thermal performance factors (η) for the present test channels as well as the rib-roughened channels [21-23] decrease as Re increases 
for turbulent flows. Having considered the increased convective areas from the various HTE devices on their thermal performances, 
the present scale-roughened pin-fin channels consistently provide the highest η×EAR values as seen in Fig. 8-b due to the large EAR 
for the present test channels. When the application can provide the sufficient pressure potential to overcome the large increase in f, 
the scale-roughened pin-fin channel can be selected for further improvements in HTE impact and thermal performance with EAR 
considered.

derived for two scale-roughened pin-fin channels with S/DP=1 and 2 under forward and backward flow conditions.

turbulence diffusion enhanced in the further downstream. This causes the primary and secondary horseshoe vortices near the 
protrusion-endwall junctions to be more diffuse and the endwall reattachments due to separated shear layers behind the pins to be 
less distinct and separate at the developed flow region. As a result, heat transfer rates on the surfaces of endwalls and pin-fins 
increase streamwisely over the first few rows of pin-fin array even if the downstream boundary layers grow thicker. Local endwall 
heat transfer distributions show less distinct features in the developed flow region relative to its developing counterpart in a pin-fin 
channel [21]. 
 
In either the developing or developed flow region of a pin-fin channel, the protrusion-endwall configurations as well as the pin-fins 
trigger a number of complex vortex structures that affects the endwall heat transfer performances. Of the primary importance for 
endwall HTE performances is the horseshoe vortices that form upstream of each pin at pin-endwall junction. Regional HTE effects 
are generated by the secondary advection of horseshoe vortices as they advect away from the stagnation line on the upstream edge of 
each pin that rolls the cooler fluids toward the heated endwall [15]. Two legs of each horseshoe vortex, rolling around the adjoining 
pin, advect further downstream to form near the edges of the pin fin wake [21]. But the wake behind each pin recirculates the heated 
coolant and generates a low heat transfer region behind the pin. Further downstream of the re-circulation zone with low flow 
velocities, the reattachment due to shear layer separation elevates local heat transfer again. Along the edges of these wakes, the 
separated shear layers promote turbulence productions and transportations which lead to two concentrated high heat transfer regions 
aside each pin. Although these flow features characterize the flow physics in a pin-fin channel that generalize the endwall heat 
transfer performances, the HTE effectiveness and pressure drop characteristics also vary with by-pass flows over pin-tips [1,20,24], 
height-to-diameter ratios of pins [3-5,8], shapes [6,11,15,17,19-20,24-26], arrangements [2,7,10,12-14,18-19,22-24], materials [14] 
and the three-dimensionality [8-9,13,15,16] of pins as well as the orientation of pin-array in the cross flow [6,27]. Theses geometric 
factors are sometime interrelated to affect the endwall heat transfer performances and the pressure drops of pin-fin channels. In light 
of endwall heat transfer performances, the systematic reduction of inclined angles of pin-fins mounted on endwalls from 90
0
 to 40
0
 
in a narrow rectangular channel incurs the consistent decreases of averaged endwall heat transfer levels and pressure drops [27]. 
Averaged endwall heat transfer rates for relatively short pins are slightly lower than for long pins but the pressure drops display no 
such differences [7]. The staggered diamond pin-fin array with pitch ratios of 1.5-2.5 d offers the considerable HTE effects; while 
the elliptical pins provide the higher thermal performance factors when the HTE ratio is rationalized by the augmented pressure loss 
[26]. These studies [1-26] always assure that the increase in endwall heat transfer is accompanied by a substantial increase in 
pressure losses. Nevertheless, with the performance analysis of rectangular ducts enhanced by the staggered square pin-fins [20], the 
increase of pin-tip clearance from the untouched endwall systematically reduces the endwall heat transfer level and the pressure drop 
coefficient. When the C/d ratios vary in the range of 1~8, the pin-tip leakage effects on overall thermal resistance of the pin-fin array 
appear to be minor but the considerable reductions in pressure drops through such pin-fin sinks are observed at the pin-pitch of 2.2 d 
[24]. Although it has been a long term fact that the pin-tip by-pass flows can considerably reduce the pressure drops through pin-fin 
channels, the accompanying moderation of their HTE effectiveness has prohibited the further progress to explore the thermal 
performances of detached pin-fins with very small pin-tip clearances from the untouched endwall. No previous work has been 
reported on the endwall heat transfer and pressure drop in a pin-fin channel with the C/d ratio less than 1. Inspired by the 
experiences gained from the detached ribs [28] for heat transfer elevations, the very small C/d ratios can result in the local wall-flow 
accelerations and trip the additional separated shear layers for promoting local heat transfer on the endwall. As a preliminary study 
for pin-fin channels with detached pin-fin arrays, this study compares the detailed endwall heat transfer distributions at C/d = 0, 1/4, 
1/2 and 3/4 as Re = 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000 and 30000 with the pressure drop characteristics examined. It is worth noting that 
the detached pin-fins offer the additional convective cooling areas on pin-tips and over the untouched endwall. Thermal performance 
factors based on constant pumping power consumptions are compared for four rectangular channels with a set of identical pin-array 
configurations but different C/d ratios. 
 
2. Experimental details 
The detailed endwall heat transfer measurements are performed using the steady-state method with wall temperature profiles 
detected from the infrared radiometer. The flow circuit with measurement devices, data acquisition systems, heat loss and heat 
transfer experiments and the method of data processing follow our previous work reported in [29]. References to evaluate the HTE 
effectiveness and the pressure-drop augmentation for four tested pin-fin channels are respectively evaluated from the Dittus-Boelter 
correlation as Nu∞ [30] and the Blasius equation as f∞. Thermal performance factors (η) are accordingly quantified as 
3/1)//()/(  ffNuNu  where Nu  and f are the endwall area-averaged Nusselt number and the Fanning friction factor based on the 
inlet-to-exit pressure drop of each pin-fin test channel.

complete the electrical heating circuit. In order to control the prescribed Re at the entry plane of the test section within +1% 
discrepancy from the targeting value, the coolant mass flow rate specified by the tested Re is frequently adjusted to compensate the 
property variations of the test fluid due to temperature variations as a result of heat transfer. This requires the pressures and 
temperatures of test coolant in the entry plenum chamber (10) to be metered by a set of pressure transducer (20) and type K 
thermocouple (21). The evaluation of local fluid bulk temperature (Tb) is based on the enthalpy balance method. The convective heat 
flux (q) at a selected X location is obtained by averaging all the spanwise q data collected at the X location as q(X). Having 
determined q(X) and the through flow mass flow rate ( m ), the Tb increase between two successive measurement locations in X 
direction is determined as ΔTb = q(X) × heating area /( m Cp) where Cp is the specific heat of coolant evaluated at the constant 
pressure. The Tb value at each detected X location is obtained following such successive calculation procedure starting from the Tb 
measurement at flow entry. Three additional type K thermocouples are equally spaced along the spanwise centerline over the exit 
plane of the test section to measure the flow exit temperatures in order to check the accuracy of Tb evaluation. Detailed Tw 
measurements over the scanned endwall are imaged by a calibrated two dimensional infrared radiometer (22). The reference fluid 
temperature is defined as the local fluid bulk temperature to evaluate the local Nusselt number and the fluid properties such as the 
thermal conductivity and viscosity. Characteristic length selected to define Re and Nu is the hydraulic diameter of test channel (D). 
 
2.2 Program and data processing 
With five tested Re of 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000 and four C/d ratios of 0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 1, the heat transfer coefficients are 
measured at the steady states, while the entry-to-exit pressure drops are individually measured at isothermal conditions. With heat 
transfer tests, heater powers are constantly adjusted to control the hottest spot over the heated endwall at 373K. Having adjusted the 
heater power or the airflow rate, the corresponding steady state is assumed when the variations of wall temperatures between several 
successive scans are less than 0.3
0
C. Transition periods for steady states generally take 45 minutes after the adjustment of heating 
power or airflow rate. The on-line data acquisition system is activated as the steady state condition is satisfied that records all the Tw 
measurements as well as the relevant measurements such as the heater power, the mass airflow rate and Tb measurements for the 
subsequent data analysis. These raw measurements are converted into local Nu over the scanned endwall using equation (1).

The local convective heat flux (q) in equation (1) is obtained by subtracting the local heat loss flux from the total heat flux supplied. 
The characteristics of external heat loss at various temperature levels were determined from a number of heat loss calibration runs. 
Each set of calibration test runs was performed with the flow blocked off with the fiberglass thermal insulating material filled in the 
channel. The heat supplied to the heating foil was entirely lost externally. The supplied heating power was balanced with the external 
heat loss at the corresponding steady-state temperature distributions. A review of wall temperature data collected from the entire heat 
loss calibration runs showed the less than 2.56% of non-uniformity in the wall temperature distributions. The plot of heat-loss flux 
against the corresponding steady wall-to-ambient temperature difference revealed a linear-like functional relationship, which 
correlated the heat loss flux with the local wall-to-ambient temperature difference. As the pin-fin array generates spatial heat transfer 
variations, the local wall temperatures varied spatially during heat transfer tests. Therefore the external heat loss remained as a 
spatial function that resulted in the non-perfect uniform flux heating condition over the endwall. With the attached pin-fins, the 
endwall heating area used to evaluate the heat flux excludes the contacting area of pins. With detached pin-fins, the endwall heating 
area is obtained by multiplying the channel-height with channel-length for evaluating the heat flux. The ratio of endwall convective 
areas between the detached and attached pin-fins is 1.216 for the present test section. Heat loss fluxes increase as wall-to-ambient 
temperature differences increase. The proportionality between the heat loss flux and the wall-to-ambient temperature difference is 
determined through a series of calibrating tests for each test module. Such heat loss proportionality is combined into the data 
processing program to account the distributions of endwall heat loss flux. As the local heat loss fluxes vary with Tw distributions, the 
distributions of convective heat flux are accordingly affected by the endwall Tw distributions. However, as the maximum proportion 
of heat loss flux for the present series of tests is about 9.3%; the endwall thermal boundary is controlled at the basically uniform heat 
flux condition. Having determined the profiles of convective heat flux over the endwall, the local fluid bulk temperature (Tb) is 
sequentially evaluated using the enthalpy balance method starting from the Tb measurement at the entry plane of the test section. The 
calculated Tb value is constantly checked with the averaged Tb measurements at the exit plane of test section. Data batches can only 
be recorded when the differences between the calculated and measured Tb values are less than 10%. Fluid properties required to 
define Re, f, and Nu are accordingly evaluated from the local fluid bulk temperature. With pressure drop tests, the dimensionless 
pressure drop coefficients are evaluated as the Fanning friction factors (f) using the pressure drops (ΔP) across the pin-fin test 
section of length L with mean flow velocity (Wm) as: 
 
f = ΔP/(0.5ρWm

)(D/4L)               (2) 
 
A set of correlations that evaluate the area averaged endwall Nusselt number ( Nu ) and the pressure drop coefficient (f) with Re and 
C/d ratio as the determined variables are derived. Thermal performance factors (η) are subsequently analyzed to compare the overall 
thermal performances of four tested pin-fin channels with C/d ratios of 0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 and 1. 
 
The maximum uncertainties of Nu, f and Re are calculated in accordance with the policy of ASME J. Heat Transfer on reporting the 
uncertainties in experimental measurements and results [31]. The major sources for attributing experimental uncertainties of Nu and 
f originate from the temperature and pressure-drop measurements respectively. Our previous repeatability calibration tests for the 
present infrared thermal image system indicated the maximum uncertainty of temperature measurements is 0.7 K The precision of

With detached pin-fins of C/d<1, the flow mechanisms in association with pin-wall junctions on the endwall are diminished but the 
vortex shading process as well as the enhanced turbulent mixing tripped by the protruding pin-fins still prevail over the mainstream. 
Instead of the horseshoe vortices developed on the endwall mounted with attached pin-fins, the accelerated flow through the gap 
between each pin-tip and the endwall modifies the boundary layer behaviors. Also the redistribution of flow rate through the gap at 
each tested Re with a pre-defined airflow rate considerably alters the X-wise velocity profiles that induces secondary vertical 
velocities heading toward the untouched endwall [33]. In this respect, the streamwise velocity within the detached pin-fin array is 
low and rather uniform, while the streamwise velocity above each pin-tip in the gap is much higher. Regions adjacent to the pin-tips 
form the intermediate layers with severe velocity gradients, resembling the conventional shear layer flows [33]. Extents of these 
accelerated shear layers emanated from the gaps between pin-tips and the endwall result in local heat transfer elevations as marked 
underneath each pin as shown in Figs. 2-b and 2-c. Such local HTE effects due to accelerated shear layers in the gaps above pin-tips 
are systematically faded when the C/d ratio increases from 1/4 to 2/4 and vanished as C/d=3/4 (see Figs. 2-b→2-c→2-d). However, 
it is persistently showed in Figs. 2-b, 2-c and 2-d that two streamwise stripes with low Nu values of 2-3 d bandwidths develop along 
the X-wise axes between Y/D = 0.5-1 and 1.5-2 on the endwall with detached pin-fins. This particular heat transfer phenomenon can 
be relevant with the flow interactions between the channel sidewalls and the accelerated shear layers emanating from the gapes 
above the pin-fins from the detached pins adjacent to two sidewalls. Further increases of C/d ratio widen such low Nu stripes and 
moderate the spatial Nu differences among these two axial stripes in the regions of Y/D = 0.5-1 and 1.5-2. Future works are 
worthwhile in order to clear the flow physics responsible for such systematic Nu variations along the streamwise axes between Y/D 
= 0.5-1 and 1.5-2 on the endwall with detached pin-fins. Justified by the pair of high Nu stripes with the bandwidth of about 1 d 
alongside the edges of two sidewalls as seen in Figs. 2-b, 2-c and 2-d, the corner vortices in the rectangular channels with detached 
pin-fins, which roll the cooler fluids toward the heated endwall along two sidewalls, are likely induced by the flow interactions 
between the pin-tip flow and the sidewall. Another worth noting observation is the weakened HTE effects offered by the wake 
shading and turbulent mixing over the endwall when the C/d ratio increases from 0 to 3/4. As illustrated previously, the two 
competing flow mechanisms, namely the increased downstream turbulent mixing due to wake shading from upstream pin-rows and 
the downstream thickened boundary layers, result in the low Nu entry region prior to the third pin-row as seen in Fig. 2-a. Such entry 
regions with relatively low Nu values systematically expand further downstream as the C/d ratio increases by way of the sequential 
examination of Figs. 2-a→2-b→2-c→2-d. This particular heat transfer result reflects the weakened streamwise increasing rate of 
turbulent mixing as the C/d ratio increases. As a result, the competition between the enhanced downstream turbulent mixing and the 
thickened boundary layers requires the longer developing length to grant for streamwise heat transfer elevations. The number of 
pin-row that initiates the high heat transfer performances thus systematically increases from the third pin-row with the attached 
pin-fins array (C/d=0) to the 5
th
 – 10th pin-rows with the detached pin-fins of C/d = 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 as seen in Figs. 
2-a→2-b→2-c→2-d. The expansion of entry region with low Nu values due to the increase of C/d ratio from 0 to 3/4 is the main 
attribute for the systematic reduction of the area-averaged Nusselt number over the untouched endwall of the detached pin-fin 
channel. The heat transfer characteristics demonstrated by Fig. 2 are followed by all the present test results in the Re range of 
10000–30000. 
 
The impacts of C/d ratio on local heat transfer performances from the reference conditions with attached pin-fins (C/d=0) are 
highlighted by normalizing the local Nusselt numbers on the endwall with detached pin-fins (Nu
D
) to those with attached pin-fins 
(Nu
A
). Fig. 3 shows the distributions of Nu

Fig. 4 X-wsie Nu profiles at various Y locations for pin-fin channels with C/d = 0, 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 at Re = 30000. 
 
By way of comparing the X-wise Nu profiles along the stagnation line and two side edges of the X-wise pin-row adjacent to the 
channel sidewall for both attached and detached pin-fins as shown in Figs. 4-d, 4-e and 4-f, the considerably Nu differences between 
those along the stagnation line and along two side edges of this X-wise pin-row demonstrates the generation of circumferential Nu 
variations on the endwall over each attached or detached pin-fin region due to the sidewall effects. By comparing the Nu profiles 
collected in Figs. 4-c and 4-d, the levels and distributing patterns of X-wise Nu variations along the same side edges of two different 
X-wise pin-rows at Y/D = 1.62 (central region) and Y/D = 2.11 (sidewall region) are similar in the channels of C/d = 0 and 1/4 but 
are different in the channels of C/d = 2/4 and 3/4. The Nu levels in the developing flow regions of the two test channels of C/d = 2/4 
and 3/4 depicted in Fig. 4-d are getting higher than those counterparts showed in Fig. 4-c as a result of channel sidewall effects. 
Further shift of the X-wise profile toward the channel sidewall from Y/D = 2.11 (Fig. 4-d) to the spanwise location of Y/D = 2.38 
(Fig. 4-f) amplifies the X-wise Nu variations from those within the central region of pin-fin array. By comparing the X-wise Nu 
profiles collected in Figs. 4-b and 4-f for the attached pin-fin channel (C/d = 0), it is noticed that the Nu levels and the Nu 
oscillations along this side edge of the X-wise pin-row at the location of Y/D = 2.38 are considerably suppressed. The stagnant 
pressure field built along the sidewall corner of the test channel with attached pin-fins is likely to suppress the vortex motion and 
turbulent activities which lead to the moderate pin-wise Nu oscillations accompanying by the lower heat transfer rates. On the 
contrast, the channel sidewall effects augment the Nu oscillations along the side edge of the X-wise pin-row at the location of Y/D = 
2.38 for the detached pin-fins of C/d = 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 from their counterparts displayed in Fig. 4-b for the central regions of pin-fin 
 30 
Chyu et al [34] at Re=18000 results in 17% lower values of present Nu . These discrepancies can be attributed to differences in 
channel aspect ratio, pin pitch ratio, experimental setup and boundary conditions. Giving the satisfactory comparisons between 
present Nu  data with the results reported by other research groups for the channels with attached pin-fins, the subsequent data 
analysis aimed at revealing the impacts of C/d ratio on Nu  is performed. As shown in Fig. 6, the Nu  levels in these four pin-fin 
channels at each Re tested systematically decrease as the C/d ratio increases from 0 to 3/4. But the reductions in Nu  from the 
reference levels of attached pin-fin channel are only about 7% for the detached pin-fin channel with C/d = 1/4. As displayed in Fig. 6 
for each C/d controlled data series, the Nu  value increases with the increase of Re that follows a general trend specified in 
equation (3) which automatically satisfies the limiting condition of diminished forced convective capability ( Nu →0) as Re→0. 
 
Nu  = A{C/d} Re B{C/d}                 (3) 
 
With the present pin-fin configurations, the coefficient A and exponent B in equation (3) are functions of C/d. Table 1 summarizes 
the coefficients A and exponents B derived for four test channels with C/d = 0, 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4.

Fig. 6 Comparison of endwall area-averaged Nu values for the pin-fin channels with  
C/d = 0, 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4.

C/d ratio of pin-fins A B Correlation factor 
(r

) 
0 (attached pin-fins) 0.507 0.6 0.999

2/4 (detached pin-fins) 0.115 0.68 0.983 
3/4 (detached pin-fins) 0.051 0.74 0.995 
 
The systematic decrease of A coefficient accompanying with the systematic increase of B exponent as C/d ratio increases is clearly 
indicated in Table 1. Such trends of variation for A and B values against C/d ratio are showed in Fig. 7 that reflect the enhanced 
impacts of forced convection on heat transfer from the scenarios dominated by the vortex complex in the channel with attached 
pin-fins as the C/d ratio increases from 0 to 3/4. Nevertheless, as the C/d ratio increases to the limiting condition that features the 
so-called zero pin height (C/d>2.5 for present cases), the heat transfer results shall recast the conditions of forced convection in the 
rectangular channel with smooth walls. The existence of limiting condition equivalent to the forced convective flow in the 
smooth-walled channel predefines the functional structure of A and B values as the exponential complex function which are 
respectively derived as equations (4) and (5). 
 
A = 0.02 + 0.487 e
–3.13C/d
                (4) 
B = 0.8 – 0.241 e–1.52C/d                (5) 
 
It is interesting to note the asymptotic A, B values evaluated from equations (4) and (5) which show the close agreements with the 
coefficients in the Nu  correlations for smooth-walled channels. The maximum discrepancies between the correlated results from 
equation (3) and the experimental measurements are controlled within the range of +14% for the entire Nu  data generated. 
 32 
 
Coefficients m and exponents n in equation (6) are summarized in Table 2 four test channels with C/d = 0, 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4. 
 
The varying manners of m, n values against C/d ratio as depicted in Table 2 echo the data trends of A, B coefficients revealed in Figs. 
8-b and 8-c that approach the asymptotic smooth-walled channel conditions. With the consideration of featuring the so-called zero 
pin-height scenarios as the C/d ratio reaches the limiting conditions, the m, n values are derived as equations (4) and (5) respectively.

Correlations (7) and (8) infer that the further increase of C/d ratio can lead to the negative n exponent with coefficient m reduced. 
Maximum discrepancies between the correlated f values evaluated from equation (6) and the experimental data are less than +11% 
for the entire f data generated.

Augmentations of Nu and f values from the smooth-walled references for the pin-fin channels with C/d = 0, 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 are 
indexed by the ratios of Nu /Nu∞ and f/f∞ respectively. In view of the C/d impacts on Nu  and f values as described by Figs. 6 and 
8 respectively, the moderation of endwall HTE effect is accompanying with the reduction of pressure-drop penalty as C/d ratio 
increases from 0 to 3/4. Such comprises between the HTE effect and the pressure-drop penalty due to the variations of C/d ratio are 
illustrated by plotting Nu /Nu∞ ratio against f/f∞ ratio as shown in Fig. 9. At each tested Re as seen in Fig. 9, the increase of C/d ratio 
drives the data points obtained with C/d = 0, 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 toward the asymptotic smooth-walled condition of Nu /Nu∞ = f/f∞ = 1. 
Although all the data series connecting by the four data points collected from C/d = 0, 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 follow a similar trend, the 
increase of Re systematically moderates such varying trend with a tendency to flatten the data trend constructed by the data points 
obtained with various C/d ratios as Re→∞. In other words, the increase of C/d ratio toward the smooth-walled condition (C/d→∞) at 
a finite Re value incurs the diminished HTE effect ( Nu /Nu∞=1) with the vanished increase in pressure drop (f/f∞=1). But as Re→∞ 
with a finite C/d ratio, the Nu /Nu∞ ratio approaches unity with the f/f∞ ratio approaches ∞. Therefore the trade-off between HTE 
effects and pressure-drop penalties is in favor of the test condition with Re=10000 rather than the condition of Re=30000 for the 
present test channel with attached or detached pin-fins. As indicated in Fig. 9, the Nu /Nu∞ (f/f∞) ratios for the present tested pin-fin 
channels fall in the ranges of 1.86-2.43 (75.2-126.6) with C/d=0, 1.75-2.22 (43.9-77.5) with C/d=1/4, 1.49-1.53 (31.4-56.1) with 
C/d=2/4 and 1.21-1.23 (22.4-37.7) with C/d=3/4.

3.4 Thermal performance factor 
The assessment of thermal performances for the pin-fin test channels with different C/d ratios is performed by comparing their η 
factors based on the same pumping power consumption. Fig. 10 shows the variations of η factor against Re at each C/d ratio tested. 
As shown in Fig. 10 for each C/d controlled data series, η factors decrease with the increase of Re. This particular η versus Re trend 
is due to the decrease of Nu /Nu∞ ratio and the increase of f/f∞ ratio as Re increases. In the Re range of 10000-30000, the highest η

Abstract 
 
Endwall heat transfer measurements for a radially rotating rectangular pin-fin channel with the width-to-height ratio (aspect ratio) of 
8 are performed at the parametric conditions of 5000<Re<20000, 0<Ro<1.4 and 0.1<Δρ/ρ<0.21. Centerline heat transfer levels along 
the leading and trailing endwalls of the rotating pin-fin channel are respectively raised to 1.77-3.72 and 3.06-5.2 times of the 
Dittus-Boelter values. No previous attempt has examined the heat transfer performances for the pin-fin channel at such high rotation 
numbers. A selection of experimental data illustrates the individual and interactive Re, Ro and buoyancy number (Bu) effects on heat 
transfer. Spanwise heat transfer variations between two adjoining pin rows are detected with the averaged Nusselt numbers (Nu) 
determined. A set of empirical equations that calculates Nu values over leading and trailing endwalls in the developed flow region is 
derived to correlate all the heat transfer data generated by this study and permits the evaluation of interactive and individual effects 
of Re, Ro and Bu on Nu. With the aid of the Nu correlations derived, the operating conditions with the worst heat transfer scenarios 
for this rotating pin-fin channel are identified.

along the line of developing the empirical heat transfer correlations. These empirical heat transfer equations not only stand for the 
entire set of heat transfer data generated with the capabilities to uncouple the individual but mutually interactive Ro and Bu effects 
on heat transfer but also determine the spanwise- averaged Nusselt numbers ( Nu ) in the developed flow region. However, this set of 
Nu  correlations is limited to determine the endwall heat transfer performance. The operational conditions with the worst endwall 
heat transfer scenarios for this rotating pin-fin channel are parametrically identified using the heat transfer correlations generated by 
this study. 
2. Experimental details 
 
2.1 Rotating test rig and heat transfer test module 
The constructional details of this rotating test rig and its instrumentations for measurements of flow-rate, heat-flux and temperature 
as well as the data acquisition system have been previously reported [28]. The 420mm long pin-fin test channel is mounted on the 
platform of the rotating rig giving the mid-span radius (R) of 420mm. The maximum rotational speed of heat transfer test channel is 
500 rev/min. The pressurized and dehumidified test coolant (dry airflow) is channeled through a set of pressure regulator and filter, a 
pressure transducer, a mass flow meter and a needle valve that controls the mass airflow rate into the pin-fin test channel. Air flows 
radially outward through the rotating pin-fin channel. Fig. 1(a) depicts the heat transfer test section that shows the assembly of the 
test module and the geometry of the pin-fin array. The origin of the present X-Y coordinates is located at the mid-span of the bottom 
edge of the endwall as indicated in Fig. 1(b). The test section is a five-layer sandwiched model consisting of an entry plenum, two 
supporting flanges, a pin-fin channel and the existing plenum with choking device. Ten staggered rows of circular pin-fins (1) with 
the X-wise and Y-wise pin-pitches of 2 pin-diameters (dp) are mounted between two Teflon leading (2) and trailing (3) endwalls 
normal to the flow direction inside the rectangular test section (4). The channel width (136mm) to channel height (17mm) (aspect 
ratio) is 8 which gives the hydraulic diameter (d) of 30.2mm. The characteristic length selected to define the dimensionless groups is 
not the pin diameter but the hydraulic diameter of the test channel (d), which is established convention for pin-fin ducts. Each pin is 
made of the thermally insulating material (Teflon) with the diameter of 13.5 mm. The additional fin effects provided by this pin-fin 
array on HTE effectiveness are not included. The Nu data generated here is limited to the endwall heat transfer performance only. 
The leading or trailing heater surface (5)(6) on which the wall temperatures (Tw) are measured is made of a continuous 27mm wide, 
136mm long and 0.1mm thick stainless steel foil. The adjustable DC electrical power is directly fed through the heating foils (5)(6) 
to simulate the basically uniform heat flux thermal boundary over the leading or trailing endwall. The electrical power for Joule 
heating is supplied via a Variac transformer with the total power consumption metered by a Wattmeter. At each tested flow condition, 
the heating powers are constantly adjusted in order to reach the pre-set Tw levels and vary the relative strength of buoyancy level. 
Two ends of each heating foils (5) or (6) are sandwiched between the insulation Teflon plates and the entry and exit copper plates 
(7)(8) those connect with copper bars to complete the electrical circuit. The leading and trailing endwalls fitted with heating foils 
and pin-fin array sandwich two Teflon sidewalls (9)(10) to formulate the rectangular pin-fin channel. The complete set of pin-fin test 
section is tightened by four draw bolts (11) between the entry (12) and exit (13) plenum chambers and two sets of axial bolts (14) 
through two Teflon sidewalls. The entry plenum chamber (12) with dimensions of 250×180×120 mm joins with the pin-fin test 
section (4) to simulate the abrupt entry condition. This abrupt flow entrance with the abrupt area ratio of 19.46 triggers the 
simultaneous developments of thermal and hydrodynamic boundary layers at the immediate flow entrance of the heat transfer 
section. Prior to the heat transfer test section (4), honeycombs and steel meshes are installed inside the entry plenum chamber. The 
temperature of test coolant in the entry plenum chamber (12) is metered by a type K thermocouple (15). Three additional type K 
thermocouples (16) are equally spaced along the spanwise centerline over the exit plane of the test section to measure the exit fluid 
temperatures. The measured exit fluid bulk temperature is approximated as the averaged value of these three thermocouple 
measurements (16). A needle valve (17) is fitted on the convergent exit plenum chamber in order to adjust the pressure level inside 
the rotating pin-fin channel. Air leakages from the jointed surfaces are prevented by means of a series of 'O' ring seals and high 
temperature sealants. Thermal insulation tapes are wrapped over the external surfaces of the heat transfer assembly in order to 
minimize the external heat loss. The complete test module is vertically mounted onto the rotating platform with the dynamic balance 
ensured.  
 
As indicated in Fig. 1(b), nine K-type thermocouples are installed on the back of each leading or trailing heating foil along its 
centerline for streamwise Tw measurements. These streamwise thermocouples locate at the mid-pin positions. Between pin-rows 8 
and 9 over the leading or trailing endwall, seven spanwise thermocouples at the pin and mid-pin locations are installed to detect the 
spanwise Tw variations in the developed flow regime over the endwall. At each thermocouple junction on the back of the thin heating 
foil, the ceramic cement is applied to secure its position. Thermocouple wires are taken out of the test assembly via the grooves 
machined on the Teflon back walls. These temperature measurements are scanned by a PC via the Net-Daq Fluke Hydra 2640A data 
logger. All the relevant raw data such as temperature measurements, airflow rates, pressures and heater powers are stored in this PC 
for the subsequent data processing. 
(a) 
 40 
 
The local convective heat flux (q) in equation (2) is obtained by subtracting the external heat loss flux from the total heat flux 
supplied. The heating area selected to calculate the heat flux is the endwall area with the pin-fin sectional areas deducted. Heat loss 
calibration tests are performed to generate the correlation between external heat-loss fluxes and the wall-to-ambient temperature 
differences at various rotational speeds. This set of heat loss correlation is incorporated into the data processing program to evaluate 
local heat loss fluxes and consequently the local convective heat fluxes. The maximum heat loss flux takes place at the test 
conditions with the highest rotational speed and wall temperatures, which is about 8.9% of the total heat flux supplied. Having 
determined the local convective heat flux (q) at each axial station where the wall temperature (Tw) is detected, the local enthalpy 
balance is accounted to calculate the fluid bulk temperature (Tb) at this particular Tw spot. To check the accuracy of such energy 
accountancy, the calculated and measured Tb values at the flow exit are constantly compared when the heat transfer tests are 
performing. Only the raw data can be collected for subsequent processing when the differences between the calculated and measured 
Tb values are lesser than 10%. All the fluid properties used to define the dimensionless parameters in equation (1) are evaluated at 
these Tb values. Table 1 summarizes the parametric conditions examined here. The maximum Re and Ro in Table 1 are not 
simultaneously attainable. The present ranges of Ro and Bu are considerably extended from the previous experiences [16-27] by 
increasing test pressures and the channel hydraulic diameter (d). Test pressures are controlled in the range of 1.1-2.4 bars that allow 
for the full coverage of the parametric conditions summarized in Table 1.

The present experimental programs perform heat transfer tests at static and rotating conditions with a final phase of deriving Nu  
correlations. Steady state heat transfer measurements are carried out at both static and rotating conditions. The steady state condition 
is assumed when the temporal Tw variations after several successive scans are lesser than +0.3
0
C. Generally, the flow and heater 
power have to be kept for about 45 minutes in order to satisfy such steady state criterion. The heat transfer results obtained from the 
static pin-fin channel are compared with the relevant data available for validation. This set of heat transfer data obtained at the 
zero-rotating speed is treated as the database against which the heat transfer results detected from the rotating channel are compared. 
Each set of heat transfer data generated by the rotating pin-fin channel is produced at fixed Re and Ro by adjusting the rotational 
speed, coolant mass flow rate and the pressure level. At each Re-Ro tested, four heater powers that raise the highest Tw levels to 363, 
383, 403, and 423 K are supplied to generate four different steady state conditions with different buoyancy levels. These four sets of 
heat transfer data are acquired at fixed Re and Ro with four ascending buoyancy levels which reflect the isolated Bu effect on local 
Nu. However, adjustments of heat flux vary local Tb values and accordingly vary the fluid properties such as viscosity and thermal 
conductivity of the test coolant (dry air). To control Re and Ro at the flow entrance within the maximum deviations of +1% from the 
targeting values, the mass airflow rates are frequently adjusted so that the changes of fluid properties due to variations in Tb are 
compensated. 
 
For heat transfer tests, the acquisition of experimental heat transfer data requires the finite wall-to-fluid temperature difference 
which inevitably inherits certain degrees of buoyancy impact on heat transfer results. Therefore an additional set of data that is 
needed to separate Re or Ro impact from Bu interaction is alternatively obtained by extrapolating the rotational heat transfer data 
into the limiting condition of Bu=0 while Re and Ro remain as the targeting test values. This regression process generates a set of Nu 
data at the zero-buoyancy conditions with which the analysis of individual Re or/and Ro effects on Nu or Nu  can be performed. 
Having realized the individual and inter-correlative relationships between Re, Ro and Bu on heat transfer, a set of Nu  correlations 
is derived to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of Re, Ro and Bu on Nu  along the leading and trailing endwalls in the 
developed flow region of the rotating pin-fin channel. Typical HTE effects generated by various surface enhancements for rotating 
channels are also compared with the present pin-fin channel to reveal the different degrees of rotational impacts on heat transfer. The 
uncertainty analysis indicates that the most of experimental uncertainties result from the temperature measurements because the fluid 
properties are estimated from Tb. Appling the method of estimating experimental uncertainties recommended by the editorial board 
of ASME J. Heat Transfer [31], with the values of Tw-Tb in the range of 50-83 K, the estimated maximum uncertainties for Nu, Re,

Fig. 2-c depicts the spanwise Nu0/Nu∞ variations along the centerline between two adjoining pin-rows 8 and 9 where the flow is 
considered as developed. Along this spanwise centerline at 7.14 x/d, the zigzag patterns with the higher Nu0/Nu∞ ratios at BP 
locations are consistently found at all the Re tested. Over the entire Re range from 5000 to 20000, the ratios of Nu0/Nu∞ vary in the 
range of 3.1 to 2.3. It is worth noting that the addition of heat transfer capacities produced by pin surfaces can significantly elevate 
the HTE performances from the conditions reported for endwalls only. Also indicated in Figs. 2-b and 2-c are the reduced local 
Nu0/Nu∞ ratios as Re increases. Such systematic reductions in Nu0/Nu ratios as Re increases indicate that the Re exponent in Nu0 
correlation for this pin-fin channel is lesser than 0.8 for the Nu correlation. Consequently, the HTE effect in terms of Nu0/Nu∞ 
attributed from the pin-fin array is Re dependent. 
 
Due to the spatial variations of flow structure in this pin-fin channel, the functional relationship between Nu0 and Re at each 
measurement spot is individually examined. As the variations in Pr are negligible over the temperature range covered here, the local 
Nu0 values are correlated as Nu0 = A(x/d)  Re
 n(x/d)
. The coefficient A and exponent n vary with the axial and spanwise locations. 
This set of correlations (not shown here) that evaluates local Nu0 values is derived to serve as the zero-rotation heat transfer 
references against which the rotational Nusselt number (Nu) is compared and normalized. The heat transfer performance in the 
developed flow region of this pin-fin channel is indexed as 0Nu  which is acquired by averaging all the spanwise Nu0 
measurements at the BP and FP locations along two opposite centerlines between pin-rows 8-9 (x/d=7.15) over the leading and 
trailing endwalls. The varying manner of 0Nu /Nu ratios against Re for BP and LP locations are displayed in Fig. 3 in which the 
0Nu /Nu ratios at BP location are consistently higher than those at FP location.

Fig. 3 0Nu /Nu variations against Re at BP and FP locations. 
 
Also shown in Fig. 3 is the comparable data of Chyu [14] and Lyall [33] which share the similar geometries of pin-fin array and test 
channel for the purpose of validation. As seen in Fig. 3, the range of differences between the present 0Nu /Nu and those reported 
in [14] and [33] less than 15% is due to the differences in H/d ratio, channel aspect ratio and the number of pin-rows of these pin-fin 
channels. Because the 0Nu /Nu ratios cited in [33] are the spatially averaged Nu0 values calculated from the full-surface Nu0 
distributions over the entire endwall, the spanwise-averaged 0Nu  value defined by this study seems to be close to the spatially 
averaged Nu0 value. The validation demonstrated in Fig. 3 seems to be satisfactory. The 0Nu  correlations at BP and FP locations 
are respectively derived as equations (3) and (4) to level the averaged heat transfer performances in the developed flow region of the 
present static pin-fin channel.

3.2 Rotational heat transfer results in general 
It is a well known fact in this technical community that the Coriolis secondary flows convect the cooler fluids from the duct-core to 
the trailing edge with the heated coolant flowing along the periphery of the rotating duct toward the leading edge when the 
mainstream of airflow is radially outward. This is referred to a major impact of Coriolis forces on mean flow fields as the so-called 
Coriolis washing effect. However, in the rotating pin-fin channel, the Coriolis secondary flows are constantly disturbed by the 
pin-fin array. But the velocity components driven by Coriolis and rotating buoyancy forces can still affect the vortical flows tripped 
by pin-fins as well as the turbulent structures. In addition, the Coriolis forces generate the spanwise pressure gradient that modifies 
 44 
pin-fin channel. 
 
 
 
Fig. 5 Spanwise distributions of Nu/Nu∞ over (a) leading and (b) trailing endwalls with Re = 5000, Δρ/ρ = 0.15,  
Ro = 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.4 at 7.14 x/d location. 
 
 
Clearly, the presence of rotational forces in the enhanced coolant passages of turbine rotor blades interacts with a variety of HTE 
elements to produce different flow structures and heat transfer performances. It is interesting to know how the different flow 
interactions between the rotational forces and the flow features induced by various types of surfaces roughness such as ribs, pin-fins 
and dimples can affect the cooling performances of these rotating channels to what extents. This attempt is realized by comparing 
the variations of Nu/Nu∞ against Ro for various sets of data collected from the rotating ribbed [23-29], dimpled [27] and pin-fin [16] 
channels. Such comparison is made in Fig. 6 where the Nu/Nu∞ data generated by this study is included. The ranges of Δρ/ρ for each 
data trend compared in Fig. 6 are indicated by the data available in the open literature.  
 
As well as a reconfirmation, the present data agrees well with those reported in [16] for the rotating pin-fin channel in the low Ro 
range (Ro<0.3). It is noticed in Fig. 6 that the different geometries of channel wall provide various degrees of impact on Nu0/Nu∞ in 
these rotating channels. Among these rotating channels with smooth-wall [22], 90
0
 [24] and 45
0
 ribs [23,29], dimples [27] and 
pin-fins [16], the smooth duct [22] shows the lowest heat transfer levels but with the largest range of Nu/Nu0 from 0.45 (leading) to 
3.8 (trailing) in the Ro range of 0-0.5. The widest varying range of Nu/Nu0 in the Ro range of 0<Ro<0.5 among the comparative 
groups collected in Fig. 6 indicates the largest extents of rotational influences on heat transfer in the smooth duct. The endwall 
Nu/Nu∞ for the rotating pin-fin channels as shown by the data from [16] and present study are compatible with those in the dimpled 
channel [27]. With Ro<1.5, the range of Nu/Nu0 between 0.8(leading) and 2.1(trailing) for the present pin-fin channel is lesser than 
the varying range of 0.6(leading) – 2.2(trailing) for the square duct roughened by 450 ribs [29]. It is worth mentioned that the data 
points collected in Fig. 6 are affected by Bu as well. The ranges of Nu/Nu0 are subject to the variations from the scenarios depicted in 
Fig. 6 to some extent at the conditions with the non-existent buoyancy impact. The less extent of rotational influences on the endwall 
heat transfer due to the presence of pin-fin array is revealed by the comparative study showed in Fig. 6. As described previously, the 
protruding pin-fins disturb the Coriolis secondary flows in the rotating channel and result in the less degree of rotational impacts on 
endwall heat transfer. The less degree of heat transfer enhancements from the duct roughened by 45
0
 ribs [29] results in the lower 
heat transfer rates in the rotating pin-fin channel over the trailing endwall.

nominal Δρ/ρ along leading and trailing centerlines.

linearly as Ro increases. It is noticed that, by adding the impeding buoyancy effects, the Nu / 0Nu  ratios are somewhat reduced. 
Therefore the  1 curves showed in Fig. 9 limit the upper bound heat transfer performances for in this rotating pin-fin channel. The 
review of the present data ranges with involvements of the impairing Bu effects indicates that the ranges of Nu / 0Nu  on the 
leading and trailing endwalls are 0.8-1.6 and 1-2.1 respectively. The upper bounds of maximum Nu / 0Nu  ratios on the leading 
and trailing endwalls defined by the zero-buoyancy performances can reach 1.8 and 2.4 respectively. Converting the entire ranges of 
Nu / 0Nu   including the zero-buoyancy conditions into the HTE effectiveness in terms of Nu /Nu∞ shows the Nu /Nu∞ ratios 
on the leading and trailing endwalls fall in the ranges of 2.6-5.9 and 3.3-6.9 respectively. The comparison of  1 values between the 
leading and trailing counterparts as shown in Fig. 9 clearly indicates the increased heat transfer differences as Ro increases due to the 
enhanced Coriolis effects. 
 
The variations of  2 versus Ro on the leading and trailing endwalls as seen in Fig. 10 depict a general trend of complex exponential 
function. The  2 values remain all negative and increase to asymptotic values. However, the magnitudes of  2 are reduced as Ro 
increases. Although the date points collected in Fig. 10 reveal a general trend of developing toward the positive  2 values, all the Ro 
controlled  2 values still remain negative in the parametric range of 0<Ro<1.4. Also the magnitudes of  2 value on the trailing 
endwall are consistently larger than the leading counterparts. The trailing wall thus undergoes the more severe impairing buoyancy 
impacts on heat transfer relative to its leading counterpart in this rotating pin-fin channel. Considering all the data trends revealed in 
Figs. 8-10, a set of Nu / 0Nu  correlations that can determine Nu  values at the BP and FP locations in the developed flow region 
on the leading and trailing endwalls of this rotating pin-fin channel is generated as equations (6)-(9).

Fig. 10 Variations of  2 values against Ro on the leading and trailing endwalls at (a) BP (b) FP locations. 
 
Equations (6)-(9) correlate and represent all the Nu / 0Nu  measurements generated here which can be readily adopted for CFD 
validations. A comparison of all the experimental measurements with the calculated results for Nu  using equations (6)-(9) is 
performed. There are 90% of experimental data found to be agreed with the correlation results within +30% discrepancies as shown 
in Fig. 11. However, the applications of equations (6)-(9) beyond the parametric ranges specified in Table 1 gives rise to the 
extrapolating uncertainties. 
 
With the assist of the derived 0Nu  and Nu  correlations, the charts which refers to the rotation induced relative heat transfer 
modifications from the static references in terms of Nu / 0Nu  are constructed for this rotating pin-fin channel. Within the 
 50 
from the Nu0 references. But the heat transfer levels on leading endwall are subsequently increased as Ro increases from 0.1 to 
1.4. On the trailing endwall, the increase of Ro produces consistent heat transfer elevations from the Nu0 references. Along with 
these typical rotational effects on local Nu, the spanwise zigzag Nu patterns over the leading endwall are systematically 
moderated as Ro increases; but the spanwise zigzag Nu patterns are still persistent on the trailing endwall. Acting by the Coriolis 
forces, the endwall vortices tripped by pin-rows attach firmly on the trailing endwall but are lifted on the leading endwall in this 
rotating pin-fin channel. 
3. Isolations of Re effects from the synergistic Ro-Bu impacts on Nu is achieved by representing the rotational heat transfer data in 
terms of Nu/Nu0. Due to the combined Ro-Bu impacts involving the impairing Bu effects, the ranges of Nu / 0Nu  on the 
leading and trailing endwalls are 0.8-1.6 and 1-2.1 respectively. The upper bounds of maximum Nu / 0Nu  develop at the 
conditions without buoyancy impacts with Nu / 0Nu  respectively reaching 1.8 and 2.4 on the leading and trailing endwalls. The 
worst heat transfer scenarios develop on the leading endwall that lead Nu / 0Nu  to 0.89 and 0.8 at the BP and FP locations 
respectively. 
4. Increasing rotating buoyancy caused a decrease in wall heat transfer at all measurement locations. The relative decrease in heat 
transfer with buoyancy was greater at low Ro and less at the highest Ro. 
5. A set of heat transfer correlations that permits the evaluation of Nu  at FP and BP locations in the developed flow regime of 
present rotating pin-fin channel is derived to represent the experimental heat transfer data generated by this study with the 
individual and interactive influences of Re, Ro and Bu assessed.
