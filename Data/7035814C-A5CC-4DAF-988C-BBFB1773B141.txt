Abstract 
 
This project was originally proposed to 
be a three-year research project. However, 
National Science Council only passed the 
first year project which studies the primary 
design for wide-color-gamut displays. 
Therefore, this report only covers the results 
of the first year project. There are two 
published papers for the results, which were 
published in the Journal of the Society for 
Information Display (vol. 15, no. 12, pp. 
1015-1022, 2007. and vol. 4, no. 11, 2008.) 
The first paper proposed the primary 
selection method so that the color gamut of a 
wide-color-gamut display matches a target 
color gamut in CIELAB color space so that 
the display is able to show the desirable color 
appearance. The second paper, which will be 
published in Nov. 2008, proposed the 
primary selection method so that the power 
consumption of a wide-color-gamut display 
can be saved. The basic concept is to 
compromise between the primary saturation 
and power consumption so that the display is 
power saving and is able to show the 
desirable color appearance. The content of 
the first paper is explicitly described in this 
report. 
 
Keywords: wide-color-gamut display, laser 
display, LED display. 
 
二、緣由與目的 
 
The color gamut of a display is 
determined by color coordinates of the 
primaries and white point in addition to 
luminance values of black point and white 
point [1,2]. The display with larger color 
gamut is able to show more colorful and 
attractive images. The color gamut of a 
display can be expanded by using high 
saturation primaries. Owing to the advance 
of display technologies, wide-color-gamut 
displays have been realized but are not yet 
popular. Liquid crystal displays backlit with 
light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser 
projection displays are two examples of 
displays providing high saturation primaries. 
Primaries are often selected to obtain 
desirable cost, life time, luminance efficiency, 
and color coordinates. This paper focuses on 
the issue of the selection of primary color 
coordinates. Primary color coordinates are 
usually selected to provide coverage of a 
target chromaticity triangle in the CIE xy 
chromaticity diagram or CIE u v′ ′  
chromaticity diagram [3]. Fig. 1 shows 
examples of the chromaticity triangles of 
NTSC and HDTV (ITU-R BT. 709) standard 
primaries together with illuminant C and D65 
white [1,2]. As shown, the chromaticity 
triangle of the NTSC color standard is larger 
than that of HDTV color standard. However, 
phosphors of NTSC primaries have been 
judged to be obsolete due to lower luminance 
efficiency [1]. Therefore, the HDTV color 
standard follows the PAL color standard [2]. 
However, the color gamut of a display is a

where (Xr, Yr, Zr), (Xg, Yg, Zg), and (Xb, Yb, Zb) 
are the maximum tri-stimulus vectors of the 
red, green, and blue primaries, respectively. 
Note that Y stimulus values relate to the 
luminance of the primary. The X and Z 
stimulus values can be derived from the (x, y) 
color coordinates and Y stimulus.

The 3×3 matrix in Eq.(1) is known as

where (xr, yr), (xg, yg), and (xb, yb) are the 
color coordinates of the red, green, and blue 
primaries; wherein zr=1-xr-yr, zg=1-xg-yg , 
zb=1-xb-yb, and zw=1-xw-yw; (xw, yw) provide 
the color coordinates of the white point and 
zw=1-xw-yw. NTSC and HDTV standards 
specify the use of illuminant C and 
illuminant D65 as white points, respectively. 
However, the use of illuminant D65 white 
point is more popular for NTSC in practice 
[1]. Thus, we take D65 white point for laser 
displays considered in Section V. For LED 
displays considered in Section VI, C white 
point is assumed because target color gamut 
(Pointer’s color gamut) were measured with 
illuminant C. Color gamut boundary of the 
display in the XYZ color space can be 
calculated according to the method given in 
Reference [12]. The color gamut boundary in 
CIELAB color space can be calculated from 
the XYZ color space. 
For red, green, and blue primaries with 
spectral power densities ( )rS λ , ( )gS λ , 
and ( )bS λ , respectively, the required 
optical power ratios among red, green, and 
blue primaries are

where ( ) ( ) ( )/i i iS V d S dη λ λ λ λ λ= ∫ ∫ , i=

efficiency of the human eye [5]. If the 
primary is monochromatic, ( )i iVη λ= , 
where rλ , gλ , and bλ  are the red, green, 
and blue primary wavelengths, respectively. 
The optimal object color gamut is 
enclosed by the maximum luminance surface 
and the boundary surface of monochromatic 
light in CIE xyY chromaticity space [5,7,8]. 
It has been shown that the maximum 
luminance efficiency for a given CIE xy 
chromaticity coordinates can be obtained if 
the material has a spectrophotometric curve 
that is everywhere either zero or unity and 
has at most two transitions between these 
values within the region of visible radiation.

Using Eq.(6) as the reflectance 
(transmittance) of an object, we can search 
all possible combinations of 1λ  and 2λ  to 
find the color gamut boundary in XYZ color 
space. Fig. 3 shows the contours of the color 
gamut boundary represented in CIELAB 
color space for several constant lightness L* 
values with illuminant D65. In theory, the 
required number of primaries is infinite for 
the ideal display, that is, its color gamut is 
the same as the optimal object color gamut. 
To achieve this requirement, every primary 
of the ideal display must be monochromatic 
with a maximum luminance that is 
infinitesimal. The relative maximum 
luminance values of monochromatic 
primaries depend on the illuminant of the 
object color. Because of high primary

where Nd and Nt are the discernible color 
numbers of the display and the target color 
gamuts, respectively. DCNR= 73.5% for the 
NTSC color gamut shown in Fig. 2 and the 
optimal object color gamut shown in Fig. 3, 
respectively, in which Nd= 258,910 and Nt = 
352,263. Note that the value of ijf< >  given 
above for the NTSC primaries and the 
optimal object colors is close to this ratio. 
The ratio of the chromaticity triangle area of 
the NTSC primaries with respect to the 
chromaticity area of the optimal object colors 
is only 47.1%, in which the latter area is the 
area of the horseshoe-shaped region that is 
bounded by the spectrum locus and the 
purple line shown in Fig. 1. Thus, the area 
ratio seriously under estimates the relative 
gamut size of NTSC primaries with respect 
to the optimal object colors.

color gamut that can be reproduced by a 
display, we define the effective display color

四、結果與討論 
 
In this section, the optimal object color 
gamut is taken as the target color gamut for 
selecting primary wavelengths of laser 
displays, in which illuminant D65 white 
point is used. For a set of given red and green 
primary wavelengths, we optimize the blue 
primary wavelength for minimizing σ . Figs. 
4 (a) and 4(b) show the optimized blue 
primary wavelength and the corresponding 
σ , respectively. From Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), 
σ  is minimized around rλ = 607 nm, gλ = 
520 nm and bλ = 455 nm, where DCNR and 
EDCNR are about 87% and 85%, 
respectively. The minimum σ = 0.160 is at 
rλ = 607.5 nm, gλ = 520.4 nm and bλ = 
454.7 nm, in which eσ = 0.1293, DCNR= 
86.7% and EDCNR= 84.68%. For the 
display with the minimum σ , its primary 
color coordinates (xr, yr)= (0.6574, 0.3423), 
(xg, yg) = (0.0774, 0.8341), and (xb, yb) = 
(0.1514, 0.0224); required luminance ratios 
: :r g bY Y Y = 0.609: 1: 0.046; required optical 
power ratios : :r g bP P P = 0.817: 1: 0.696. 
Although the required luminance of the blue 
primary is low compared with that of red and 
green primaries, the required optical power 
of the blue primary is comparable with that 
of red and green primaries. Fig. 5(a) shows 
the color gamut of this display. Comparing 
the color gamut boundaries shown in Fig. 3 
and Fig. 5(a), we can see that they are similar 
as expected. 
Next, we consider the minimization of 
the effective gamut standard deviation eσ . 
Figs. 6 (a) and 6(b) show the optimized blue 
primary wavelength and the corresponding 
eσ , respectively. From Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), 
eσ  is minimal around rλ > 637 nm, gλ = 
518 nm and bλ = 460 nm. In this region, 
DCNR and EDCNR are about 92% and 87.5 
%, respectively. The minimum eσ = 0.1083 
is at rλ  = 649.7 nm, gλ = 518.1 nm, and 
bλ = 462 nm, in which σ = 0.1949, DCNR= 
92.4% and EDCNR= 87.5%. For the display 
with the minimum eσ , its primary color 
coordinates (xr, yr)= (0.7258, 0.2742), (xg, yg) 
= (0.0601, 0.8298), and (xb, yb) = (0.1408, 
0.0332); required luminance ratios 
: :r g bY Y Y = 0.404: 1: 0.059; and required 
optical power ratios : :r g bP P P = 2.499: 1: 
0.605. Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) show the display 
color gamut and effective display color 
gamut of this optimized display, respectively. 
For comparison, we show the effective 
display color gamut of the display with the 
minimum σ  in Fig. 5(b). Comparing Figs. 
 8
465.6 nm for the minimum eσ , in which 
eσ = 0.015, DCNR= 152.4%, EDCNR= 
99.7%, : :r g bY Y Y = 0.413: 1: 0.118, and 
: :r g bP P P = 1.115: 1: 1.011. For this example, 
the effective display color gamut is also 
nearly the same as Pointer’s color gamut 
because eσ  is still very small. 
 
五、計畫成果自評 
 
A method is proposed for selecting 
primaries of a wide-color-gamut display 
according to a target color gamut in CIELAB 
color space. We define the gamut standard 
deviation that is the standard deviation of the 
relative maximum chroma of display and 
target color gamuts. A small gamut standard 
deviation value represents display and target 
color gamuts that are similar in shape. The 
selection method optimizes the display 
primaries for the minimum gamut standard 
deviation. It is shown that the color gamut of 
a laser display can be designed to be similar 
to the optimal object color gamut in shape. 
The part of the display color gamut that is 
within the target color gamut is called the 
effective display color gamut. We also define 
the effective gamut standard deviation that is 
the standard deviation of the relative 
maximum chroma of the effective display 
and the target color gamuts. It is found that, 
for the laser display, primaries designed by 
minimizing the effective gamut standard 
deviation, are highly similar to the optimal 
object color gamut in shape. Design 
examples for LED displays are also shown, 
in which red, green, and blue LED 
bandwidths are assumed to be 20 nm, 40 nm, 
and 30 nm, respectively. The gamut of 
Pointer’s real world surface colors is 
assumed as the target color gamut for the 
LED displays. Because the gamut shape of 
Pointer’s real world surface colors is quite 
different from that of typical three-primary 
displays, we only consider the primary 
selection that minimizes the effective gamut 
standard deviation. It is shown that 99.7% of 
Pointer’s color gamut can be enclosed by the 
color gamut of an LED display. For both the 
laser and LED displays, it is necessary to 
constrain the red primary wavelength to 
avoid excessively high optical powers for the 
red primary. In practical applications, less 
saturated primaries are preferred for 
increasing display brightness. The selection 
method minimizing gamut standard deviation 
can be applied to selecting less saturated 
primaries, in which the target color gamut is 
derived from a set of preferred and less 
saturated colors.
