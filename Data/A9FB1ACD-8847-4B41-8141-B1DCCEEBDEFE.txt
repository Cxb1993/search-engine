ABSTRACT 
Precast fabricators face numerous challenges as they strive for business success. Among them, 
demand variability is arguably the biggest headache. The objective of this series research is to 
consider demand variability in the precast production schedule to absorb the impact of demand 
variability.  
A Buffer Evaluation Model (BEM) developed using Fuzzy Logic (FL) is firstly proposed to 
evaluate the required time buffer for the variability (NSC 94-2218-E-212 -011). In the model, 
fabrication due days are evaluated using FL by considering factors that induce demand variability. 
To acquire production schedules in terms of buffered due days, a Lean Production Scheduling 
Model (LPSM) is developed using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) (NSC 
95-2221-E-212-051). The model proposes a flowshop sequencing model by considering buffer 
sizes between stations and constraints encountered in fabrication. Precast fabricators strive for 
business success on delivering products on time, which is supported through numerous resources 
of the enterprise. To achieve the goal, a Resources Planning System (PrecastERP) is developed to 
improve the performance of current precast production systems. In this system, BEM and LPSM 
are integrated as production scheduling module that is regarded as the core of PrecastERP. Two 
additional modules are developed, namely customer management module and material 
requirement planning module. PrecastERP is functioned through the integration of those three 
modules with internet technology. The present research work is one of the first studies applying 
lean concepts in precast production system.

6) Developing Scheduling Module: A framework integrating BEM and LPSM is developed in this 
activity. Production sequences are generated using multi-objective genetic algorithms. 
7) Developing Material Management Module: A production plan cannot be fulfilled without 
sufficient material supplies. A material management module is proposed to arrange material 
requirements. Material managers can also use the module to monitor material levels. This activity 
is underway. 
8) Verifying and Validating PrecastERP: Numerous real cases will be used to verify functions of 
the PrecastERP.  
9) Draw Conclusions and Recommendations: The attained research contributions, advantages of 
applying the PrecastERP, and future research topics will be documented.  
3. System Development Process 
An OO system development process, namely Unified Process (UP), is adopted to develop 
PrecastERP. UP has been widely used as a standard method in software engineering (Booch et al. 
1999). It consists of four stages: inception, elaboration, construction, and transition (as shown in 
Figure 1).

4. System Architecture 
PrecastERP is designed as a web system, so that users can access the same database through 
internet. Multiple users can also use the software at the same time. These characteristics enhance 
PrecastERP as a platform that can be used everywhere for which has internet connection. These 
components are aggregated into system architecture represented in Figure 2. Computing power of 
PrecastERP is provided by Dell enterprise computer. Module functions are programmed using C# 
programming language. Data are stored in MS Access database. Module functions are 
manipulated through Http/Https protocols. Software programmed using C# can be executed by 
any kinds of browsers including PDA devices. It means that uses can use PrcastERP anywhere 
and anytime through internet.

Scheduling Framework 
The study proposes a framework to arrange production sequences. The framework is 
formulated by three steps, as shown in Figure 6. The first step is to evaluate a time buffer using 
fuzzy logic. Fabrication due dates are then adjusted using production strategy according to 
inferred buffer. Finally, production sequences are optimized by a multi-objective genetic 
algorithm. Details about each step are explained as follows.

Time Buffer Evaluation 
Applying the production strategy that finishes production later relative to delivery date, 
finished goods inventory can ideally be reduced. Unfortunately, variability such as material 
supply not on time, productivity lose, unplanned machine down time, variation of setup times 
(molds), etc. is everywhere in the precast production system. Fabricators may out of capacity if 
every element is fabricated just-in-time. A proper time buffer between delivery date and 
production due date is therefore necessary, just-in-case. Demand variability is arguably the 
biggest headache when fabricators strive for business success. To avoid producing products that 
falls into victim of demand variability, elements should be fabricated later relative to delivery 
dates. By the contrast, for the situation that demand variability is relatively less, production 
loading can be mitigated if elements are fabricated relatively earlier. So that fabricators have 
more capacity for prior jobs. Demand variability, so called because it originates with the customer, 
causes fabricators to risk the loss of capacity or increases inventory costs (Ballard and Arbulu 
2004). Reasons inducing demand variability are complex and situation depended. However, some 
features of a project indeed have more chances inducing demand variability. Through 
 6
MOGLS can find a better Pareto solution than those using other methods. The study therefore 
adopts MOGLS as a prototype algorithm for searching for optimum production schedules. 
Precast Production Modeling 
Flowshop sequencing problem regards production as a continuous flow. Typical equation 
used to calculate completion time is shown in Eq. (1).  
( ) { }1 1, ax ( , ), ( , ) +j k j k j k jkC J M M C J M C J M P− −=                (1) 
where ( ),j kC J M  denotes completion time for jth element in k machine,  jkP is an operation 
time for jth element in k machine (   0jkP ≥ ). 
Eq. (1) assumes an infinite buffer size between stations so that production flow can be 
continuous. In practice, due to the large size of precast elements, buffer size between stations is 
limited. The regular flowshop sequencing model shown in Eq. (1) cannot meet the needs of 
precast production. The formula is therefore reformulated as Eq. (2). 
( ) { }1 1, 1, ax ( , ) , ( , ) +j k j k j k j k jkC J M M C J M WT C J M P− − −= +              (2) 
where 1,j kWT −  is the time for (j-1)th element in k machine waiting to be sent to buffer, which can 
be represented using Eq. (3).

In Eq. (3), kB  is the buffer size between k th machine and ( 1k + )th machine. When 
completion time of kB th element at machine k  is latter than the beginning time of machine 
( 1k + ), buffer size kB  is not fully filled, otherwise, waiting time occurs.  
Unlike general flowshop sequencing problems, precast production features interruptible and 
uninterruptible activities. The situation is formulated in Eq. (4).

Concrete casting is an uninterruptible activity. The job must be postponed to the next 
working day if it cannot be completed within working hour or overtime. Completion time for 
concrete casting can be calculated using Eq. (7).

7. Material Management Module 
A production plan cannot be fulfilled without sufficient material supplies. A material 
management module is thus proposed to arrange material requirements. The study adopts bill of 
material (BOM) to establish the material planning module. The main focus of the module is on 
purchasing orders to satisfy material requirements. Schema of the module is shown in Figure 9. 
Inputs of the module are item mater (BOM), on-hand inventory, scheduled receipts, and 
production sequences arranged using scheduling module. As each part in the module is processed, 
material requirements are generated for lower levels. The material planning module processes all 
parts for one level before beginning the next level. Because of the way low-level codes are 
defined, doing this generates all the gross material demand for a low-level part before it is 
processed. Outputs of the module include planned order releases, change notices, and exception 
reports. The basic procedure of the module is discussed as follows: 
• Netting: Determine net requirements by subtracting on-hand inventory and any scheduled 
receipts from the gross requirement. 
• Lot sizing: Divide the netted demand into appropriate lot sizes to form jobs. 
• Time phasing: Offset the due dates of the jobs with lead times to determine start times. 
• BOM explosion: Use the start time, the lot sizes, and the BOM to generate gross requirements 
of any required components. 
• Iterate: Repeat these steps until all levels are processed.

Production Scheduling Module 
The scheduling module provides seven functions, which can be expanded from module 
selection. Production engineers can directly modify system parameters through this module. Once 
completed, optimum production sequences can be found using Search Optimum Solution 
function. Eventually, production engineers can select one of Pareto solutions as production 
sequence for the project (see Figure 13).

Material Management Module 
The module provides material managers with purchasing orders, change notices, and 
exception notices. The module is driven by BOM that can be identified using Edit BOM function. 
Gross material requirements can thus be analyzed using Generate Gross Requirements function 
demonstrated in Figure 14. Material managers can print orders using the function.
