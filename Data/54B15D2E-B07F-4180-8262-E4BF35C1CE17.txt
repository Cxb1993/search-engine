 由分析結果可知，在圖二所示為 x方向之
移動，其可利用平面上之三個壓電材料控
制平台之移動情況，但在三個撓性接點
處，其變化較大，因此在平台中央可獲得
平移狀態，但是在撓性接頭部份，則有結

由圖三可發現在致動之雙致動器有較大位

 II. THEORY 
The AFM cantilever beam has an infinite number of 
resonant frequencies. The first resonant frequency is the 
minimum resonant frequency of the beam. However, the 
corresponding amplitude of vibration is the maximum 
vibrational amplitude of the beam. Therefore, the 
measurement method adopted in this study is based on the first 
resonant frequency of the cantilever beam. Cleveland et al. [2] 
showed that the spring constant of micro-fabricated cantilevers 
can be determined by measuring their resonant frequencies 
before and after the addition of a small end mass. The first 
resonant frequency of the cantilever beam is given by: 
0 *
ck
m
ω =             (1) 
where  ck  is the spring of stiffness with an effective mass 
dependent on the beam geometry and *m  is the effective mass 
of the cantilever. For a uniform cantilever with a rectangular 
cross-section, the effective mass is given by * 0.24 bm m=  
where bm  is the mass of the beam. V-shaped cantilevers can 
be well approximated by two rectangular beams in parallel. [2, 
8] When an end mass m is added to the cantilever beam, the 
resonant frequency is given by: 
1 *
ck
m m
ω = +               (2) 
Similarly, when the end mass m is reduced, the resonant 
frequency is given by: 
1 *
ck
m m
ω = −                                                (3) 
Provided that the major structure of the AFM cantilever 
beam is not damaged, the spring of stiffness with an effective 
mass dependent on the beam geometry remains constant. In 
general, it is difficult to obtain the spring of stiffness with an 
effective mass dependent on the beam geometry. [6] Therefore, 
in investigating the effect of adhesion between the cantilever 
beam and the specimen surface, this study considers the ratio 
of the adhesive mass to the effective mass of the cantilever 
beam. From Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), it can be shown that: 
( )2 * 2 *0 1m m mω ω× = +                            (4)

Eq. (6) expresses the ratio between the adhesive mass and the 
effective mass of the cantilever beam in terms of the change in 
resonant frequency caused by a variation in the tip mass. It can 
be inferred that ( )20 1/ 1ω ω >  when the test material adheres to 
the cantilever beam of the AFM. Conversely, ( )20 1/ 1ω ω <  
when the cantilever beam is worn by the test material.  
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The present experiments are conducted using contact 
mode V-shaped 3 4Si N  cantilevers. This cantilever is the 
ULCT-AUMT-AB mode supplied by Veeco/DI. The AFM is 
the CP-II of Veeco/DI. However, the method described in this 
study is applicable to all AFM cantilevers. Before the 
cantilever is applied to the specimen surface, its initial 
resonant frequency is measured. A series of experiments is 
then performed in which the cantilevers are extended across 
the surfaces of four different materials, i.e. Cu, Al, S45C and 
SKD11, under specified loads and the corresponding resonant 
frequency of the cantilever are remeasured. 
Table 1 shows the analytical results obtained for the Cu 
specimen. As shown, the initial resonant frequency of the 
cantilever beam was 0 / 2ω π =184690 Hz. Five measurements 
of the resonant frequency were then obtained as the cantilever 
beam was extended across the Cu surface under a load of 
10μN. Following the first test, the resonant frequency of the 
cantilever beam was found to increase from 184690 Hz to 
184700 Hz, which implies that the effective mass of the 
cantilever beam is reduced, i.e. the ratio */m m  is negative. In 
other words, the cantilever beam is worn by the Cu surface. 
The mass loss of the cantilever beam is m =-0.00010828 *m . 
To investigate the stability of the adhesion mass, the test 
procedure was repeated four more times using the same load 
of 10μN. In the second test, the resonant frequency of the 
cantilever beam increased from 184700 Hz to 184790 Hz. 
However, in the third, fourth and fifth tests, the resonant 
frequency remained constant at 184790 Hz. Therefore, the 
results indicate that in the contact between Cu and the 
cantilever beam material ( 3 4Si N ), the adhesive mass is 
constant. The mass loss remains constant in repeated contacts 
(in the third, fourth and fifth tests). The constant adhesive 
mass is a maximum. The adhesion phenomenon is likely 
saturation. The saturation phenomenon is related to the surface 
energy of the material. [5] Specifically, this phenomenon 
provides an indication of the adhesion force and the difference 
between the surface energy of the cantilever beam material 
and that of the test material. In the current case, the results 
show that the surface energy of Cu is greater than that of 
3 4Si N . Additionally, these materials have the constant surface 
energy of the material. This meaning that the saturation 
phenomenon of the adhesive mass is existence in the contact 
between Cu and the cantilever beam material.  
Fig. 1 presents the force-distance curve for the contact 
between the tip of the cantilever beam and the Cu surface. It 
can be seen that as the tip extends across the Cu surface, an 
adhesion force is produced at a particular distance. This force 
causes the cantilever beam to be attracted to the Cu surface. 
However, as the cantilever beam moves closer to the Cu 
material, the attraction force is replaced by a repellent force. 
The repellent force which causes wear of the cantilever beam 
material and the test material appears. Conversely, as the 
respect to that of the cantilever beam material (
3 4Si N ) by 
investigating the variation in the resonant frequency of the 
cantilever beam caused by changes in the tip mass due to tip 
wear or the adhesion of specimen material. Based on the 
current analytical results, the following conclusions can be 
drawn: 
1. When the cantilever beam tip contacts the Cu material, 
the tip becomes worn. Therefore, it can be inferred that 
the surface energy of Cu is greater than that of 3 4Si N . 
2. When the cantilever beam tip initially contacts a pure 
material, the adhesive mass on the tip varies with 
successive contacts. However, as the tip makes repeated 
contacts, a saturation of the adhesive mass is observed.  
3. The cantilever beam tip penetrates into the aluminum 
oxide layer of the Al specimen under a higher force. The 
property of the material surface affects the statue of the 
adhesive mass. 
4. When the test material contains many different alloy 
elements, the resonant frequency of the cantilever beam 
changes after each measurement test. Therefore, a stable 
value of the adhesive mass is not obtained, and hence an 
assessment of the surface energy is not possible. 
5. The saturated adhesive mass of S45C on the cantilever 
beam tip is greater than that of Al. Hence, it can be 
inferred that the surface energy of Al is higher than that of 
S45C. Similarly, the surface energy of Cu is greater than 
that of either the cantilever beam material (
3 4Si N ) or Al. 
Therefore, the surface energies of the cantilever beam and 
the current pure materials can be ranked as follows: 
Cu> 3 4Si N >Al>S45C. 
6. The surface energy of a rigid material (S45C) is less than 
that of a soft material (Cu). The elastic modulus of the 
material can not decide the surface energy.
