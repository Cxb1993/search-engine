PM2.5/PM10 ratio is about 0.86 when incenses 
are burned indoors, it means that particles 
generated from incense burning are mostly 
less than 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter. 
Moreover, they discussed the influence of 
distance from the source of incense burning 
on measured PM10 concentration. In their 
study, the measured PM10 concentration is 
lower than 200 µg/m3, and there is a decrease 
of 30-80% after four hours of incense burning. 
Their results show that PM10 concentration 
decreases with increasing distance from the 
source, but the decay is not significant. 
In contrast to the extensive study on 
monitoring PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations 
indoors or outdoors, the number of studies for 
PM1.0 and PM2.5 is limited. Smoking and 
incense burning are the general and important 
sources for indoor particulate. In this study, 
the effect of these indoor particulate sources 
on indoor air quality and the relationship 
between indoor and outdoor particles were 
discussed by the direct-reading aerosol 
monitoring device, DustTrak sampler. Before 
the experiments, the indoor particulate 
concentration was evaluated using two types 
of aerosol monitoring devices, DustTrak and 
4-Stage MOUDI. They were collocated 
indoors simultaneously to assess the 
comparability of the sampling methods. 
INSTRUMENTATION 
Two types of aerosol monitoring devices, 
TSI, Inc, Model 8520 DustTrak Aerosol 
Monitor (DustTrak) and the MSP Corp., 
4-Stage MOUDI, (4 Stage Micro-Orifice 
Uniform Deposit Impactor) were used in this 
study. DustTrak uses 90-deg light scattering 
to measure the mass concentration of 
particles in an air stream that pass through 
impactor assembly. The DustTrak inlet 
designed by the manufacturer for PM1.0 and 
PM2.5 monitoring were used for this study. 
Before each sampling period, the DustTrak 
impaction plate was cleaned and greased and 
the DustTrak zero point was verified or rest 
by attaching a HEPA filter according the 
manufacturer’s instructions. The sampling 
flow rate of 1.7 L/min was obtained by 
internal pump of DustTrak.  
  The 4-stage MOUDI samples were 
collected on 47mm Aluminum substrates 
(except of the MOUDI after stage, which 
used 37mm quartz filters) and all filters were 
weighed with a microbalance after 
equilibration. This impactor has a sharp cut 
size of 1.0, 2.5, 10 and 18 µm in aerodynamic 
diameter when operated at the sampling flow 
rate of 30 L/min. 
SAMPLING ROOM 
The sampling room is at the fifth floor of 
an apartment. The volume of the test space is 
120 m3 and indoor human activities were low. 
Figure 1 shows the configuration of sampling 
room.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
To compare the performance between 
DustTrak and 4-stage MOUDI samplers, the 
instruments were put at the central of the 
sampling room to monitor PM1.0 and PM2.5 
concentrations for a sampling period of three 
hours. The distance between two instruments

Effects of different indoor pollutant sources 
on indoor air quality 
To investigate the effects of different 
indoor pollutant sources on indoor air quality, 
two kinds of major indoor air pollutants 
source in Taiwan such as smoking and incense 
burning were generated and PM1.0 and PM2.5 
concentrations were monitored by DustTrak 
samplers. 
For the two different indoor sources 
experiments, the air exchange rates ranges 
from 1.24 and 1.3 1/hr, indicating that the 
ventilation in two experiments were at the 
same level. 
In the smoking experiment, Figure 4 
shows that PM1.0 and PM2.5 concentrations 
reach maximum immediately in 10 minutes 
after smoking started and then both 
concentrations drop to the background level 
in 2.5 hours. The results show that there is a 
decrease of 92% in PM1.0 concentration and 
93% in PM2.5 concentration. During the 
sampling period, the average PM1.0 and PM2.5 
concentrations were 97 ± 12 and 116 ± 15 
µg/m3, respectively. The PM1.0/PM2.5 ratio 
monitored by DustTrak sampler in smoking 
experiment was 0.83, that is, particles 
generated from smoking were less than 1.0 
µm mostly.  
Figure 5 illustrates that PM1.0 and PM2.5 
concentrations reach maximum in 45 minutes 
after incense was burning while both 
concentrations drop to background level in 5 
hours. The results show that the decreases of 
PM1.0 and PM2.5 concentrations were both 
97% and the average PM1.0 and PM2.5 
concentrations were 425 ± 5 and 502 ± 8 
µg/m3 during the sampling period. The 
PM1.0/PM2.5 ratio in this experiment was 0.84, 
that is, particles generated from incense 
burning were mostly fine mode as well. 
 
Relationship between indoor and outdoor 
particulate concentrations 
The relationship between indoor and 
outdoor PM1.0 concentrations was studied 
using two DustTrak samplers indoors and 
outdoors simultaneously. Figure 6 shows the 
distribution of monitored PM1.0 concentration 
for 24 hours. The present results demonstrate 
that outdoor PM1.0 concentration increase in 
rush hour that is generated from the exhausts 
The present results show that indoor 
particulates were less than 1.0 µm mostly with 
or without indoor pollutant sources. The 
PM1.0/PM2.5 ratio indoors was 0.74 without 
indoor pollutant source while those of smoking 
and incense burning experiments were above 
0.8. Furthermore, it was found that the indoor 
PM1.0 concentration will increase as outdoor 
PM1.0 concentration increases in rush hour by 
infiltration.
