41. Introduction
The on-going advances of Internet-based technologies have heavily influenced
lifestyles, subsequently enhancing the development of electronic commerce
(e-commerce) and driving revolutionary changes of enterprises operations with their
partners in conducting business and transactions [1]. The burgeoning growth of
e-commerce confronts both enterprises and consumers with a new situation. Growing
competition is forcing enterprises to construct new portals and provide extensive
product information to expand their markets and attract more potential consumers.
Consequently, consumers have increasing opportunities to select among competing
products that may meet their needs [2].
However, with the rapid expansion of enterprise web sites, growing quantities of
information have increased the burden on human information processing ability, i.e.
information overloads exists. Consumers thus have to an increasing amount of time
browsing the Internet to find desired information or products. Meanwhile, without
face-to-face advice, it is difficult for consumers to select among competing products on
the Internet [3]. Therefore, a well developed product recommendation system, which
helps consumers identify the products they would like to purchase by producing a
recommended list of products for individual consumers, is an enabling mechanism for
overcoming information overload occurred [4,5].
On the other hand, for different product types, consumers have various feature
spaces in terms of personal preferences, browsing histories, and products purchased;
however, enterprises have difficultly in identifying consumer interests. For example, for
infrequently purchased commodities, such as notebook computers, cellular phones and
home theater systems, it is difficult or even impossible to reason a consumer previous
preferences and due to lacking of enough information about the consumer past
6it is necessary to make product recommendations or select promotional advertisements
for display to particular consumer, selected based on demographics and past buying
behavior. A common characteristic of existing personalized recommendation systems is
the need for analysis of extensive consumer data and various consumer preferences.
Showing the same promotional advertisements to all consumers satisfying specific
conditions may be ineffective. Additionally, consumer product knowledge will
influence upon consumer selection processes. Therefore, to cope with the shortcomings
of content-based personalization and collaborative filtering, it should be conducted by
capturing accurate individual consumer interest information expressed by consumers
themselves [25], and thus several new or hybrid approaches have been proposed to
improve recommendation system accuracy, such as compositing content-based and
collaborative filtering approaches [8,26], employing data mining techniques [27-29],
and hybrid method of collaborative filtering based on users and items [30]. However,
these renovated methods only excel in classifying structure data (according to a fixed
set of attributes) to identify relationships among objects and consumers, and do not
incorporate data-in-scene analysis (such as Web browsing actions analysis). To
compensate the shortcomings of previous methods, how to accurately capture and
analyze data which implies visitor real interests to recommend suitable products as a
salesman manner while visitor exploring product on line has recently been attracting
increasing attention by both researchers and e-commence communities.
This investigation develops a salesman-like personalized recommendation
technology based on a Web browser based product preference index, which assesses
consumer product knowledge and product exploration history based on Web browsing
actions. For evaluating the methodology, a prototype salesman-like personalized
recommendation system, which focuses on selling high technology products (e.g. 3G
8consumers and possible planning of suitable promotion strategy: (1) identifying
consumers; (2) differentiating consumers; (3) interacting with consumers; and (4)
customizing products or services to meet individual consumer needs. Because of
one-to-one Internet marketing enabling communication with individual consumers
without constraints of time and space, it is cost saving to track for providing appropriate
product combinations by recording and analyzing consumer consumption and Internet
browsing actions.
2.2. Personalized recommendation system
Personalization is a special form of differentiation expression, and indicates the
ability of a website to make offers that cater to the unique needs of individual
consumers without explicitly asking their requirements, thus capturing the social
component of interpersonal interaction [32,33]. Mobasher et al. [34] defined Web
personalization as response actions based on the individual consumer interests and
hobbies related to Internet usage. Additionally, Adomavicius & Tuzhilin [21] proposed
achieving personalization by following a five stage process: (1) collecting consumer
information; (2) consumer profiling; (3) similarity comparison; (4) past and present
personalized information; and (5) measuring consumer response. Enterprises can use
this personalization process to learn consumer purchasing process details, plan suitable
promotion strategies to attract specific individual consumers, and deliver appropriate
products/services information to individuals that request them.
A recommendation system was originally designed for mail filtering system, such
as Tapestry developed by the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center [35], to allow its
members to annotate each document in detail to present how interesting the readers
found. Recommendation systems have been applied in a variety of fields [20,36-39].

accuracy rates of these analyses or enhancing the recommended satisfaction) [33].
However, the CF approach suffers several disadvantages. Firstly, it requires mass
product comparisons among consumers [8], as the computational time for product
comparisons increases with numbers of consumers and products. Second, products not
yet purchased and rated cannot be recommended [41].
The shortcoming of current personalized recommendation systems is the need to
analyze a large set of consumer data, or data from numerous consumers. However, even
within the same group, consumer preferences may differ; moreover, individual
preferences may also change with circumstances. To compensate for the shortcomings
of previous methods, how to accurately capture and analyze data which implies visitor
real interests to recommend attractive products in a salesman-like manner as visitors
explore products online has been attracting increasing attention from both researchers
and e-commence communities.
2.3 Product knowledge
As mentioned above, in the current era of information overload, consumers have to
spend more time to look for preferred products, and moreover they are often assumed to
have specific experiences with or information about products they are using or plan to
purchase. Thus, consumer knowledge, also referred to as prior knowledge (e.g., product
experiences or product familiarity), is crucial in understanding consumer production
exploration behavior, particularly for high-technology products. Consumer knowledge
of specific products or services is known as product knowledge. Alba and Hutchinson
[44] indicated that product knowledge has two main components, familiarity and
expertise, defined as “the number of product-related experiences that have been
accumulated by the consumer”and “the ability (cognitive structure and cognitive
12
difficulty of processing intrinsic information. With better knowledge structure,
experienced consumers can increase their ability to examine intrinsic information and
successfully assess product quality, thus reducing their use of extrinsic information,
such as price, in evaluating product quality. Since product knowledge may influence
consumer needs and activities, this investigation claims that consumer level of product
knowledge could be used to enhance the personalization strategies of EC retailers [48].
2.4 Web browsing actions and Web mining
Internet marketing is the process of creating and maintaining consumer relationships
via online activities to promote products and services, i.e., consumer reactions to
stimulated transactions, sensory, cognitive, and emotional experiences are quite
important for EC retailers in improving an understanding of consumer experiences in
order to appropriate marketing programs for creating long term consumer relationships
(loyalty). Consumer Web browsing action analysis enhances the understanding of
interest/intention: from loading on the homepage and exploration of relevant Web pages
to final decision submission (shopping cart). Among such Web browsing actions,
possible routes (paths) via which consumers travel to websites reveal a lot of valuable
information for understanding the phenomena they suffered, predicting consumer
decisions [49,50]; additionally, different navigation paths and clicking to different Web
pages in various ways and with various frequencies also reveal the proportional to the
consumer’s interests over the items[51]. Kwan et al. [52] further indicated that
consumer Web browsing actions on websites could be evaluated by the following four
dimensions: browsing duration, the frequency and the recency of loading on the site,
and the Web browsing path.
By employing data mining techniques to discover, extract, and analyze consumer
14
al. [58] proposed the fuzzy Web mining algorithm (FWMA) to identify fuzzy rules
between browsing times and duration spent on specific Web page, and thus specify user
browsing module. Recently, Yuan [51] considered three types of visitor feedback
actions: clicking for further information, remain to read information, and following
links to online stores to infer the target products of interest to users. Yuan further
proposed the reward function, which is defined as good actions (good ranked lists)
being likely to result in superior rewards to bad ones. The measurement of the
‘goodness’ of a ranked list is defined by analyzing of the feedback actions of consumers
on the items of the ranked list. The reward function is the weighted sum of the three
interests as shown below
ltc RwRwRwR 321  (1)
where cR denotes the interest contributed by the feedback action of clicking for details;
tR represents the interest contributed by the feedback action of staying to look at the
details; and lR is the interest contributed by the feedback action of linking to the store
web site. Table 1 summarizes the literature on Web browsing behavior mining. It is
important to, as accurately as possible, extract consumer browsing actions to obtain
consumer activities, such as browsing items, browsing sequence of the items, duration
of browsing item details, and linking to online stores, to enhance personalized
recommendation system performance, with the ultimate goal of attracting consumers
and enforcing the competitiveness for EC businesses.

hints that can help in understanding different browsing feedback activities based on the
test objectives with various degrees of knowledge while making online purchase
decisions. 3G phone is such a product that requires complex consideration during
decision-making, therefore, a questionnaire is developed for measuring objective
knowledge of 3G phone consumers. Based on the objective knowledge questions of
Park et al. [48], some of the questionnaire wording was changed to explain the context
of 3G phone use, and ten single choice questions were developed for measuring visitor
product knowledge, which was considered to include three knowledge dimensions: (1)
3G phone usage experiences (3 items); (2) basic concepts related to 3G phone (4 items);
and (3) advanced knowledge of 3G phone (3 items) (see Appendix). Figure 1 shows the
online questionnaire (Please notice the fact that those test objectives’native language is
Chinese, thus, the questions and relevant presentations, such as Figs. 3-6, are in
Chinese).
********************************************************************
Insert Figure 1 here
********************************************************************
All measurement items adopt a three-point-scale to calculate the 3G phone product
knowledge score for each test objective: providing correct answers thus can contribute
up to three points to the total product knowledge score, while supplying incorrect
answers can contribute only one or two points. The 3G phone product knowledge score
is employed to assign respondents to a suitable cluster group, then, their associate initial
weights for each preference of product preference index of Web browser (PPIWB) is
determined correspondingly. Subsequently, the 3G phone product knowledge score is
updated by the browsing actions of the test objective, and their associate weights for
each preference of PPIWB will also be further updated.
18
was applied to classify test objectives into three cluster groups, namely experienced
customers, middle-experienced consumers, and less-experienced consumers,
respectively. Finally, for each cluster group, the mean of importance (weights) was
calculated for each preference of PPIWB, and set as the initial weights.
3.1.3 Product preference index of web browser (PPIWB)
In the equation of PPIWB, Eq.(2), the weights, 1w , 2w , and 3w , as noted
previously, can be adjusted according to the test objective browsing actions.
Additionally, the preference values contributed by the feedback action of clicking for
details, cR , can be calculated as Eq. (3),
1 iNRc (3)
where N denotes the total clicking number; i represents the clicking sequence for the
specific product, and 1 is a constant to avoid zero value of cR . For example, the details
regarding test objective are listed in Table 2, the product, “Sharp 903SH”, is with
clicking sequence “3”, thus, its cR could be calculated as 5(=7-3+1). Higher cR
value indicates a strong preference for a specific product (in terms of clicking for
details).
********************************************************************
Insert Table 2 here
********************************************************************
Similarly, the preference contributed by the feedback action of staying to look at
the details, tR , can also be computed as Eq. (4),
1 iNRt (4)
where i denotes the staying duration sequence for the specific product Web page. The
staying duration sequence is based on the staying duration, i.e., with longer duration
20
3.2 The proposed system and procedure flow
The investigation focuses on efficiently providing consumers with a list of
recommended products which are recently most desired by this consumer. The proposed
salesman-like product recommendation system involves several steps, as illustrated in
Fig. 2.
********************************************************************
Insert Figure 2 here
********************************************************************
The first step is to invite each test objective to complete the 3G phone knowledge
questionnaire (shown in Fig. 1), after which the system initializes the weights of PPIWB
for the test objective based on their current ranking in terms of 3G phone knowledge.
The second step is to provide the test objective multi-functions for product inquiry.
For example, the test objective can input 3G phone features (such as brand name, price
and so on) as an inquiry condition to seek relevant product information (Fig. 3), and can
review the search results by product cluster sorting display (Fig. 4); additionally, the
details of searched products can also be shown if further request (Fig. 5). The test
objective can continue repeating the search until the target product is found.
********************************************************************
Insert Figures 3, 4, 5 here
********************************************************************
The third step is to record the browsing actions (clicking for details Rc, staying to
look at the details Rt, and repeat clicking the same product Rr) of the test objective (the
record technique is based on the Java server pages software). According to collected
records, the values of PPIWB for the specific test objective are further determined by
Eqs. (3), (4), and (5), after which the personalized recommendation list of the three
22
look at the details Rt (30%), and repeatedly clicking the same product Rr (10%), due to
all within the acceptable ranges, it is unnecessary to update the three weightings. On the
other hand, if one of the test objective feedback actions (weight composition) exceeds
the associated acceptable range, it will be updated.
4. Experiment results and performance evaluation
4.1 Experiment data analysis
4.1.1 Online experiment design
This experiment web site is designed based on Tomcat 5.5 server and several
necessary desktops (with Intel Pentium®4 2.0G CPU, 768MB memory, and 80G hard
disk); HTML and Javascript programming languages are employed to create the user
interface (input and out put); Java server pages are used to develop the browsing actions
online record function; all collected records and information are stored in the
experiment database supported by Access 2003; additionally, the data statistical analysis
is implemented by SPSS 12.0 version.
4.1.2 Experiment analysis
The experiment test objectives are limited to visitors who had previously
purchased goods from websites of EC retailers. The questionnaire survey was
administered online from 1st to 30th November, 2007; each test objective was invited to
visit the experiment web site and to log into the proposed system to obtain a username
and password, and eventually to complete the questionnaire. The investigation surveyed
a total of 260 test objectives, 49 of which were eliminated from the analysis due to
incomplete responses. The total test objectives consisted of 92 women and 119 men,
indicating stronger readiness of males to respond to the questionnaire. The vast majority
24
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin’s (KMO) measure of samplingadequacy indicated that the data
were appropriate for EFA (KMO=0.651; BT=209.114, p<0.05). EFA was then
performed using the principle components method with Varimax rotation to examine
the fit of a three-factor (usage experiences, basic concepts, and advanced knowledge)
solution, with associated eigen values are all greater than 1 and factor loadings also all
exceeding 0.5. Additionally, this solution accounted for 56.781% of the variance in the
ten items. It demonstrates superior construct validity. Regarding the reliability issue,
since the test objectives were asked to respond to the questionnaire survey, it is
important to consider the internal consistency reliability. Thus, reliability was judged by
estimating how well the items reflecting the same construct yielded similar results and
how consistent the results were for different items for the same construct within the
measure. The internal consistency reliability is estimated using Cronbach , which
measures the dispersion of different items within a single subscale. Items are examined
to identify those with negative or weak item-to-scale correlations. In this investigation,
the Cronbach’s  values for the three factors are 0.7031, 0.6862, and 0.5947,
respectively, exceeding the minimum acceptable level interval of 0.5 to 0.6 for
exploratory research [61]. Thus, the 3G phone product knowledge questionnaire appears
to have superior consistency and stability. Table 9 lists the relevant analysis of construct
validity and reliability.
********************************************************************
Insert Table 9 here
********************************************************************
Based on the responses of the 211 test objectives to 3G phone product knowledge
classification, the k-means classification algorithm is employed to divide them into
three cluster groups. Table 10 lists the clustering results and relevant features analysis.

acceptable RD level (0.579). Meanwhile, these three browsing preferences are renewed
to be the initial weights of the next randomly selected test objectives.
********************************************************************
Insert Table 11 and Table 12 here
********************************************************************
The second step is to test whether RD level can be reduced with increasing user
number. Therefore, similarly, the another 200 test objectives with online purchase
experience, sampled at 50-test-objective intervals, are invited to use the proposed
system, and total RD for each 50-test-objective interval is calculated to reveal a clear
decreasing tendency (Table 13), from 0.708 (1st to 50th) to 0.512 (51st to 100th), and then
to the acceptable level of 0.49 (200th to 250th). Therefore, it appears that the
recommendation accuracy is improved to the mature level with increasing user number.
********************************************************************
Insert Table 13 here
********************************************************************
On the other hand, the final step is to determine whether the system has good fit
with the products favored by the test objectives. Table 14 lists the rates of fit for 250
invited test objectives, only 18.4% right rate that fits consumers desires with all
recommended products, 37.2% right rate fits with the first and second recommended
products, however, the right rate fitting with the first recommended products will
achieve to 60.8% level. This not only implies the proposed system is familiar with one
or two products recommendation, but also that most visitors are primarily concerned
with the first product recommended by the system, and relatively disinterested in the
third recommended product.

28
products. Following an extended learning period, the system is expected to be able to
provide suitable recommendations to targeted customers. Regarding the fit between
system recommendations and products actually desired by test objectives, some 60.8%
right rate fits successfully consumers desires with the first recommended products. And
another 37.2% right rate fits with both the first and second recommended products, only
18.4% right rate that fits with all three recommended products. This achievement offers
consumers considerable potential time savings in terms of comparing products and
provides a basis for high quality decision-making. Similarly, in the long term
continuous learning process, the rate of good fit with test objective favored products can
also be increased. We have been now conducting more experiments to address this
issue.
Based on this study, various potential future research directions are identified. One
possibility is to extend the proposed system structure to incorporate various application
scopes, particularly for scopes based on personalized preferences and some degree of
product knowledge, among product assessment processes, and for those scopes that are
composed of products with standard specifications, such as 3C products (computer,
communication, and consumer goods) and computer peripherals online shopping. The
second possible direction for future research is to extend the recommendation function
to tender or bid applications for online products, thus providing bidders with more
sufficient and valuable information. Another important issue is to include more
preference considerations in the PPIWB function composition, such as product
condition setting and browsing paths used by visitors in the research. Additionally, it is
also valuable to trace and analyze how visitors responded to previous recommendation
lists, for example by adjusting the recommended scores for some products that are
similar to the products of interest to the visitor, then recording visitor choices and

Abstract: - The rapid growth of e-commerce has confronted both enterprises and consumers with a new situation.
Whereas companies are finding it harder to survive, consumers are unable to effectively select the products that
really to meet their needs. To reduce the product overload of Internet shoppers, a variety of recommendation
techniques that track previous actions of groups of consumers to make personalized recommendations have been
developed and applied. Current personalized recommendation systems suffer from the need to analyze large sets
of consumer data, or data for numerous consumers. However, even within a single group, consumer preferences
may differ, and individual preferences may also change with circumstances. Additionally, the consumer product
knowledge influences their browsing actions. To orient Web-visitors on how to become consumers, a
salesman-like recommendation technology was developed based on visitor product preference index, which
comprises of their product knowledge and browsing actions in scene. A prototype system for use with
high-technology product, 3G phones, was developed to test the effectiveness of the recommendation technology.
Through a test of 250 objectives, the results show that the recommendation deviation level can be reduced to
0.49, and exact fit with visitor favour products can reach 60.8%, showing that the proposed model can achieve
recommendation effectiveness.
Key-Words: - Personalized product recommendation; e-marketing; Product preference index of Web browser;
Browsing actions; Consumer product knowledge.
1 Introduction
The on-going advances of Internet-based
technologies have heavily influenced lifestyles,
subsequently enhancing the development of
electronic commerce (e-commerce) and driving
revolutionary changes of enterprises operations with
their partners in conducting business and transactions
[1]. The burgeoning growth of e-commerce confronts
both enterprises and consumers with a new situation.
Growing competition is forcing enterprises to
construct new portals and provide extensive product
information to expand their markets and attract more
potential consumers. Consequently, consumers have
increasing opportunities to select among competing
products that may meet their needs [2].
However, with the rapid expansion of enterprise
web sites, growing quantities of information have
increased the burden on human information
processing ability, i.e. information overloads exists.
Consumers thus have to an increasing amount of time
browsing the Internet to find desired information or
products. Meanwhile, without face-to-face advice, it
is difficult for consumers to select among competing
products on the Internet [3]. Therefore, a well
developed product recommendation system, which
helps consumers identify the products they would
like to purchase by producing a recommended list of
products for individual consumers, is an enabling
mechanism for overcoming information overload
occurred [4,5]. Thus, various recommendation
technologies have been developed and applied, such
as collaborative filtering [6-8], content-based
filtering [9,10], data mining process [11,12], and the
Bayesian preference model [13]. The underlying
technologies used in contemporary recommendation
systems belong to two categories: content-based and
collaborative filtering approaches [14,15]. A
common characteristic of above two approaches is
the need for analysis of extensive consumer data and
various consumer preferences. Showing the same
promotional advertisements to all consumers
satisfying specific conditions may be ineffective.
Therefore, to cope with the shortcomings of
content-based personalization and collaborative
filtering, it should be conducted by capturing
accurate individual consumer interest information
expressed by consumers themselves [16], and thus
several new or hybrid approaches have been

questions were developed for measuring visitor
product knowledge, which was considered to include
three knowledge dimensions: (1) 3G phone usage
experiences; (2) basic concepts related to 3G phone;
and (3) advantage. Fig.1 shows the online
questionnaire (Please notice the fact that those test
objectives’ native language is Chinese, thus, the
questions and relevant presentations are in Chinese).
All measurement items adopt a three-point-scale
to calculate the 3G phone product knowledge score
for each test objective: providing correct answers
thus can contribute up to three points to the total
product knowledge score, while supplying incorrect
answers can contribute only one or two points. The
3G phone product knowledge score is employed to
assign respondents to a suitable cluster group, then,
their associate initial weights for each preference of
product preference index of Web browser (PPIWB) is
determined correspondingly. Subsequently, the 3G
phone product knowledge score is updated by the
browsing actions of the test objective, and their
associate weights for each preference of PPIWB will
also be further updated.

As mentioned above, consumer total product
preference score is calculated based on the improved
Yuan’s reward function [22], PPIWB, which
comprises the weighted sum of the three preferences

women and 119 men, indicating stronger readiness of
males to respond to the questionnaire and join the
pilot test.
Based on the responses of the 211 test objectives
to 3G phone product knowledge classification, the
k-means classification algorithm is employed to
divide them into three cluster groups. Table 3 lists
the clustering results and relevant features analysis.
Some 57.3% of test objectives belong to
middle-experienced consumers (with total
questionnaire scores from 26 to 28), 27.5% belong to
less-experienced consumers (with total scores less
than 25), implying that 3G phone product is poorly
understood by most consumers. For these three
preferences by the browsing feedback action in
PPIWB, experienced consumers (with total scores
from 29 to 30) and middle-experienced consumers
both believe that clicking for details can be assumed
to be expressing their product preferences (with
initialized weights 53.4% and 41.2%, respectively),
in contrast, less-experienced consumers think that
repeatedly clicking the same product Web page can
reveal their product preferences (with initialized
weights 40.4%).

3.2. Performance evaluation
To evaluate the recommendation effectiveness, this
investigation continues surveying another 250 test
objectives with experience of using the proposed 3G
phone personalized recommendation system.
For the first step, the first another 50 test
objectives with online purchase experiences are
invited to use the proposed system, then, their RD is
calculated via records of their browsing actions
(including weights, Rc, Rt, Rr, and PRS) and actual
preference sequence (APS). Eventually, the total RD
for these 50 test objectives is calculated as 0.708,
where only middle-experienced consumers have
acceptable RD level (0.579) as listed in Table 4.
Meanwhile, these three browsing preferences are
renewed to be the initial weights of the next
randomly selected test objectives.

successfully consumers desires with the first
recommended products. And another 37.2% right
rate fits with both the first and second recommended
products, only 18.4% right rate that fits with all three
recommended products. This achievement offers
consumers considerable potential time savings in
terms of comparing products and provides a basis for
high quality decision-making. Similarly, in the long
term continuous learning process, the rate of good fit
with test objective favoured products can also be
increased. We have been now conducting more
experiments to address this issue.
Based on this study, various potential future
research directions are identified. One possibility is
to extend the proposed system structure to
incorporate various application scopes, particularly
for scopes based on personalized preferences and
some degree of product knowledge, among product
assessment processes, and for those scopes that are
composed of products with standard specifications,
such as 3C products (computer, communication, and
consumer goods) and computer peripherals online
shopping. The second possible direction for future
research is to extend the recommendation function to
tender or bid applications for online products, thus
providing bidders with more sufficient and valuable
information. Another important issue is to include
more preference considerations in the PPIWB
function composition, such as product condition
setting and browsing paths used by visitors in the
research. Additionally, it is also valuable to trace and
analyze how visitors responded to previous
recommendation lists, for example by adjusting the
recommended scores for some products that are
similar to the products of interest to the visitor, then
recording visitor choices and making comparisons
between the previous situation and the adjusted case
