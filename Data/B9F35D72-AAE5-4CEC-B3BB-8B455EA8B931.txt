Abstract 
This study elucidates the uptake and 
accumulation of radium in the field- growing 
fern Dicranopteris linearis by relating the 
radium concentration to some  potential 
chemical analogues, including alkaline earth 
metals, rare earth elements, and some important 
heavy metals. Time-dependent accumulation of 
radium and these chemical analogues for D. 
linearis were described by the 228Th/228Ra 
activity ratio, an index for inferring plant age. 
The correlation between radium and these 
elements were assessed by statistical analysis 
and used as a reference to elucidate the uptake 
and accumulation of radium in relation to the 
chemical analogues. Analytical and statistical 
results showed that the concentrations of 
alkaline earth metals (except for Mg) rare earth 
elements and some heavy metals in D. linearis 
increased linearly with plant age. These 
elements, exhibiting a similar accumulation 
pattern to radium and significant correlation 
coefficients with radium, were considered as the 
chemical analogues to radium. Additionally, the 
plant/soil concentration ratios (CRs) for radium 
and most of these analogues in D. linearis 
exceeded 1, consistent with the definition of 
hyper-accumulator plants.  
Keywords: radium, alkaline earth metals, rare

2. Introduction 
Alkaline earth metals and/or rare earth 
elements (REEs) were commonly considered to 
accumulate in plants together with naturally 
occurring radionuclides. Brazil nuts are known 
to contain higher levels of radium isotopes than 
normal plants even though Bertholletia excelsa 
(Brazil nut tree) grows in a background 
environment with normal radiation levels 
(Penna-Franca et al., 1968; Smith, 1971). Brazil 
nuts also contain high levels of barium (0.1 – 0.3 
%), which is considered chemically analogous to 
radium. The level of alkaline earth metals Ra, Th, 
and lanthanum (La) are closely associated with 
the level of calcium (Ca) in plants (Million et al., 
1994; Linsalata, 1989). All these elements are 
considered immobile and accumulate in plants 
during growth. 
Some ferns, such as Gleichenia japonica, 
Dicranopteris dichotoma, and Struthiopteris 
niponica, were identified as accumulators of 
barium (Ba), actinium (Ac), Ra and REEs 
(Kabashi and Tominaga, 1985; Koyama et al., 
1987). The fern D. dichotoma reportedly 
accumulated REEs, ranging at 0.3 – 0.7 % of its 
dry leaf biomass (Wang et al., 1997; Shan et al., 
2003). Another fern Dicranopteris linearis has 
also been identified as a potential accumulator 
plant for REEs, which can be as high as 0.1 % of 
its dry biomass (Wei et al., 2005).  
A remarkable accumulation of radium 
isotopes 224Ra, 226Ra, and 228Ra in the fern D. 
linearis was reported by Chao et al. (2006; 
2007). The radium concentration in D. linearis 
was estimated to be 10 – 100 times higher than 
the reported values for normal plants 
(Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 2001). Notably, 
the concentrations of radium and alkaline earth 
 -3-
CRs at t = 1 y, denoting the time at which the 
shoots reached maturity, which is when the 
maximum transfer from soil to plant for 
linearly-accumulating elements occurs.  
3.5 Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was conducted using 
the statistical package SPSS 13.0. All 
experiments were performed independently in 
triplicate, and the coefficient of variation (CV) 
was used to confirm the accuracy and validity of 
output data. To understand an index of uptake 
and metabolism of Ra among the related 
elements, a multiple regression analysis based 
on the stepwise method was performed to 
evaluate the contribution of each chemical 
analogue to radium accumulation according to 
plant age after controlling other potential 
chemical analogues (e.g., alkaline earth metals, 
REEs, and heavy metals). The analysis of 
Spearman correlation was conducted to elucidate 
the correlation between radionuclides and 
chemical elements. A two-tailed value of p < 
0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
3.6  Identification of D. linearis as a 
hyper-accumulator plant  
Some criteria have been proposed to assess 
plants as hyper-accumulators. Commonly, a 
hyper-accumulator plant can be defined as 
follows: (1) the metal concentration in shoots 
must exceed 1% for Zn and Mn, 0.1% for Al, As, 
Se, Ni, Co, Cr, Cu and Pb and 0.01% for Cd 
(Baker and Brooks, 1989; Baker et al., 2000); (2) 
the metal concentration in the above-ground 
portion of a plant must be 10 – 500 times higher 
than in those growing in non-polluted 
environments (Zu et al., 2005); (3) the ratio of 
shoot to root concentration must exceed 1 
(McGrath and Zhao, 2003; Zu et al., 2005); and 
(4) concentration ratio (CR) of shoot to root 
must exceed 1 (McGrath and Zhao, 2003; Zu et 
al., 2005). 
In this study, two of above-mentioned 
criteria were used to identify D. linearis as a 
hyper-accumulator plant: (I) Metal concentration 
higher than the threshold concentrations relevant 
to the potential toxic elements ( e.g., Al, As, and 
Se), which are associated with 
phyto-remediation techniques for removing 
contaminated metals from soils; (II) the CR of 
metal must exceed 1. CR is a measure of the 
capacity of a plant to take up and transport 
metals to the shoots. Most plants had CRs of < 1 
for heavy metals and metalloids. Thus, criterion 
II was suitable for determining whether D. 
linearis had the ability to uptake naturally 
occurring radionuclides, alkaline earth metals, 
and REEs in a non-polluted environment. 
4. Results and Discussion 
4.1 Element accumulation pattern with time 
Chao et al. (2007) and Wyttenbach et al. 
(1995) demonstrated that concentrations of Ra 
(226Ra and 228Ra) and alkaline earth elements Ca, 
Sr and Ba increased linearly over time during the 
growing period. Since the 228Th/228Ra ratio can 
be used as a measure of plant tissue age, 
time-dependent variations of all elements in this 
study were depicted as regression equations 
(Table 2) for each element based on the 
assumption that all elements accumulated 
linearly over time. The correlation coefficients 
of these regression equations compiled to 
varying degrees with this assumption. The 
elements with good linearity (r > 0.5) were 
considered element candidates to be 
accumulated over time (Group A), while the 
others (Group B) were not (r < 0.5). Elements in 
Group A were radium, alkaline earth metals 
(except for Mg), all REEs, and heavy metals Al, 
Mn, Fe, Zn, As, Se and Pb. Overall, the 
(CV)p/(CV)s ratios of Group A elements were 
relatively higher than element ratios of Group B 
(Table 2), implying that concentrations of Group 
A elements were age-dependent, and increased 
as growing time increased.  
4.2 Concentration ratios  
 -5-
remarkably high concentrations, exceeding 
reported values for other plants (Kabata-Pendias 
and Pendias, 2001). All REE concentrations 
were positively correlated with those of 226Ra (r 
= 0.707 – 0.838; p < 0.001) and 228Ra ( r = 
0.605 – 0.776; p < 0.001) (Table 5). The REEs 
have similar ionic radii and electronic 
configurations, resulting in their chemical 
characteristics in biogeochemical processes. 
Notably, the correlation coefficients between 
REEs (except for Y) and Ra roughly decreased 
as REEs atomic number increased. The 
concentrations of REEs in plant tissue usually do 
not reflect their distribution patterns in host soil 
due to fractionation (Liang et al., 2001; Ding et 
al., 2006; Li et al., 1998). Almost all correlation 
coefficients between the 15 REEs exceeded 0.9 
( p < 0.001), exhibiting a marked similarity in 
the uptake process by D. linearis.  
Significant correlations existed between 
Ba, La and Ce in some mushroom species, even 
though their concentrations were in normal 
ranges (Aruguete et al., 1998). No biological 
function was associated with REEs and Ba in 
plants; however, REEs and Ba are considered 
chemically similar to Ca, and can substitute each 
other in calcium-coordinating molecules (Martin, 
1983; Evans, 1990). The structure of 
REE-binding biological molecules in both D. 
dichotoma and D. linearis has been identified, 
elucidating the roles REEs play and their 
distribution in plant tissue (Guo et al., 1996; 
Shan et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2005). No literature 
focuses on the role of radium isotopes (226Ra and 
228Ra) in these plants. We anticipate that radium 
can replace REEs in the REE-binding biological 
molecules despite its low concentrations by 
weight (Table 1). 
The CRs of REEs varied at 0.6 – 4.34 
(Table 3). Most CRs exceeded 1, except for 
those of thulium (Tm) and lutetium (Lu), which 
were close to the findings in South-Jiangxi 
Region, in which the CRs for REEs were 0.72 – 
2.47 in a mining area and as high as 10 in the 
non-mining area (Wei et al., 2001). We believe 
that the CRs of REEs in D. linearis varied with 
REE concentrations in surrounding soils; the 
CRs increased when REE concentrations in the 
environment were relatively low. This uptake 
behavior resembles that of Thlaspi caerulescens, 
a hyper-accumulator plant that removes Zn and 
Cd from soils (Zhao et al., 2003)   
4.4.  Identification of D. linearis as a 
hyper-accumulator plant 
Based on the uptake pattern over time, the 
elements in this study were classified into Group 
A (linear accumulation) and Group B (non-linear 
accumulation). Generally,  elements in Group A 
had higher CVs and CRs, and better correlations 
(r > 0.5) with radium than those of elements in 
Group B; that is, the elements in Group B had 
lower CVs and CRs, and weaker correlations (r 
< 0.5) with radium. Based on the two criteria for 
identifying D. linearis as a hyper-accumulator 
plant, Table 5 summarizes the elements 
hyper-accumulated in D. linearis. Only Al 
exceeded the threshold concentration and 
thereby met Criterion I. linearis. With the 
exception of Cd, all these elemets are in Group 
A. This implies that metals be continuously 
accumulated with time in hyper-accumulator 
plants during growth. 
Most hyper-accumulator plants are 
metallophytes growing in mineralized areas and 
have developed mechanisms that allow them to 
limit uptake of metal concentrations toxic to 
most plants. Notably, although D. linearis is not 
a metallophyte, it hyper-accumulated radium and 
some chemical analogues even when grown 
under a normal radiation condition. Thus, D. 
linearis has potential for use to remove radium 
and REEs from contaminated soils, in such areas 
as uranium mining areas or area contaminated 
with REEs.
