ABSTRACT 
 A high frequency (1MHz) ultrasonic device was applied to investigate the relationships between the somatic cell counts 
(SCC) in milk and the physical properties measured through the change in the velocity and attenuation of wave propagation 
during gelation formation in the California Mastitis Test (CMT). Due to non-homogenous mixing without shear applied in 
CMT gelation, the ultrasonic signals were more unstable than under complete-mixing condition. Based on the complete-
mixing condition, the velocity had no significant relation with SCC concentration; however, there was an obviously positive 
relation between attenuation and SCC concentration. In addition, the linear-fitting slopes of attenuation during the 
measurement were positive as the SCC concentration was less than the threshold value (SCC=5x104cells/ml). On the contrary, 
the slopes became negative. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Mastitis is undoubtedly one of the most serious and 
costly infectious diseases affecting dairy cow production 
(Heringstad et al., 2000). Although the exact cost is difficult 
to quantify the exact cost, estimates in the USA are $2 
billion in the year of 2009 (Viguier, 2009). Obviously, early 
diagnosis for mastitis could improve management of 
mastitis, which can lead to possible reductions in these 
losses. One of obvious symptoms for mastitis is the increase 
in the milk somatic cell count (SCC) which is epithelial and 
white blood cells. Somatic cells are induced by the cow’s 
immune system to fight infection causing bacteria. 
Therefore, the ideal solution would be a sensor that directly 
measures SCC levels automatically on-line. Measurement of 
SCC in raw milk is widely accepted as the most useful 
indirect indicator of mastitis and milk quality. However, 
SCC can be merely counted in laboratories with flow 
cytometry. To achieve a faster, but less accurate result, 
some farmers use a simple, inexpensive, cow-side test, 
known as the California Mastitis Test (CMT) (Schalm et al., 
1957), to provide a qualitative estimate of SCC in the 
foremilk of individual cows or quarters. 
CMT is an indirect method to detect infected quarters 
on the farm based upon the reaction of special detergents 
with DNA of somatic cells and increasing the viscosity of 
the mixture which is proportional to the SCC, and an 
evaluation of the degree of gel formation is done by gently 
rotating CMT paddle. However, the test involves a 
subjective evaluation of the degree of gelling reaction 
between the milk sample and the reagent, which might 
result in false positives and negatives. Also, the relationship 
between the subjective rating and SCC in the milk sample 
(an indication of the degree of udder infection) is not 
accurate enough for many farmers. 
Currently, farmers have access to indirect estimates of 
SCC such as in-line conductivity but not to automated on-
line sensors that directly measure SCC levels. CMT has 
been attempted to mechanize or standardize by rotary 
viscometers (Nageswararao et al. 1969; Nichols et al. 1972) 
falling ball viscometers (Kiermeier et al. 1964; Carre, 1970) 
a rolling ball viscometer (Whittlestone et al. 1970) or some 
measurement based on the flow of CMT gel through holes 
or tubes of various diameters such as the Wisconsin Mastitis 
Test (Thompson & Postle, 1964) or Brabant Mastitis 
Reaction (Jaartsveld, 1962; Bottazzi, 1963). Due to 
requiring a small amount of time to conduct which can slow 
down parlor throughput, none of these systems were 
available in practice for on-line use. 
Fast analysis devices, or systems, would be highly 
desirable as they would allow an on-line response to the 
changes in media components. However, most on-line 
systems currently used have a low accuracy. The gel has 
been described as thixotropic (Whittlestone & Fell, 1965; 
Whittlestone et al. 1970b), that is, the gel breaks down 
under shear force but it reforms with the removal of the 
force. Also, rheology of the gel was investigated by using 
both capillary and rotational viscometry (Verbeek et al., 
2008) and found that the gel is non-Newtonian, but the 
initial phase of viscosity increase was not due to shear 
dependence, but rather due to the gelation reaction. It can 
therefore be deduced that the rheology of the gel is 
complicated not only by it being non-Newtonian, but also 
by the strong dependence on test conditions. These make 
designing a successful sensor much more challenging. 
On this background, ultrasound is becoming an 
alternative technique for the on-line monitoring of mastitis 
based on CMT. Most important features of ultrasonic 
systems are robustness, non-invasiveness, precision, low 
cost, rapidity and easy automation. Furthermore, ultrasound 
can be used to analyze opaque materials, offering an 
alternative to electromagnetic waves based devices. 
Recently, on-line ultrasonic techniques have been used for 
monitoring alcoholic fermentations (Becker et al. 2001; 
Resa et al. 2004), dairy fermentations (Elvira et al. 2002), 
dough fermentations (Elmehdi et al. 2003) and Escherichia 
coli growth (Reddy et al. 2001; Sierra et al. 2010). 
Understanding the ultrasonic properties of the CMT gel 
is important in the design and operation of the automated 
CMT, to provide a qualitative estimate of SCC. The purpose 
of this paper is to investigate ultrasonic characteristic of the 
CMT gel formation and to determine whether a reliable and 
inexpensive automated on-line SCC detector based on CMT 
might be developed. Therefore, in this work, measurements 
of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation in the CMT gel have 
been carried out and used to understand ultrasonic velocity 
and attenuation changes.  
2. APPARATUS AND METHOD 
An ultrasonic waveform (4 cycles) acquired is shown in 
fig. 1. The first pulse wave, peak 1a, was the input wave and 
the second pulse wave, peak 2a, was the output wave. Then 
the next incoming wave is the input wave obtained by the 
first pulse wave in fig. 1. From the waveform signal data, 
the ultrasonic velocity (c, m/s) and attenuation (α, neper/m) 
of the CMT gel were calculated as follows (Ay et al., 1994): 
c=8d/tr                               (1) 
Figure 3. Ultrasonic attenuation in CMT milk for non-
complete and complete mixing, at SCC=23.3426 (103/ml), T = 
30Ԩ and f = 1 MHz. 
According to the results described above, the signal for 
non-complete mixing was less stable than for complete one. 
The main reason for non-completely mixing was that CMT 
milk was non-homogeneous mixing, the mixing was 
conducted by diffusion effect without any shear force 
applied. Therefore, the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation 
for CMT milk were sensitive to the mixing degree of 
mixture. These trends were expected that the signals are 
more stable under complete mixing condition. In addition, 
for the purpose of validly quantitative CMT scores using 
ultrasonic technology, the influences of mixing degree 
needed to be reduced, which had better conduct 
measurement under completely mixing condition. 
Due to viscosity of CMT gel related to SCC 
concentration, the relationships of velocity and attenuation 
with SCC concentrations were compared with SCC 
threshold value (50x104 cells/ml) under complete mixing 
condition as shown in figure 4 and figure 5, respectively.  It 
revealed that there was non-significant relation between 
velocity and SCC concentration as shown in figure 4. In 
addition, according to the figure 6, the result indicated that 
the ultrasonic attenuation had a good positive relationship 
with SCC concentration, probably due to the friction of 
ultrasound propagated in gelation obviously affected by the 
gel viscosity, which may tend some ultrasonic energy to be 
adsorbed and tuned into heat.

Based on the complete-mixing condition as show in 
figure 3, the linear-fitting slopes of attenuation under 
different SCC concentrations were compared as sown in 
figure 6. The results expressed that as SCC value was less 
than threshold value, the linear-fitting slope of attenuation 
was positive. On the contrary, it became negative as SCC 
value is greater than threshold value. According to the 
results described above, evaluation of attenuation in CMT 
using ultrasonic technology might be proposed as an 
alternative method for detection of mastitis. Although the 
accuracy of the present results for CMT score was 
SCC=50x104cells/ml, the further automatic procedure of 
experiment as mixing with manually rotating would 
improve the accuracy of CMT score in the future.

題目 
ULTRASONIC CHARACTERISTICS FOR GEL FORMATION IN THE 
CALIFORNIA MASTITIS TEST 
The transducer was mounted in the one side of the 
circular cross section of a cylinder sample tank submerged 
in water bath at 30±0.1℃ in order to minimize the influence 
of the temperature on the measurements. The traversing 
distance between the transducer and the reflective surface of 
the cylinder was 1.9 cm.  Raw milk (6ml) was combined 1:1 
with an anionic surfactant (SDS: sodium dodecylsulphate, 
0.1g/ml, in distilled water). All experiments were replicated 
three times. The ultrasonic signals were collected 
continuously after CMT reagent addition for 10 seconds. 
3. RESULTS 
The ultrasonic velocity and attenuation in CMT milk 
gel were measured at SCC=72.5(103/ml), 30℃ and f=1MHz 
as shown in fig. 2 to fig. 3, separately. Dashed lines are 
linear fitting of the experimental data. These preliminary 
results indicated that ultrasonic velocity and attenuation 
increased with time duration in CMT milk. It was sensitive 
to the degree of mixing during gelation.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Due to the more DNA dissolved out of cells depended 
on the degree of mixing during gelation, the gel viscosity 
increases with the mixing duration, which induces the 
increase in the velocity. Results also demonstrate that 
attenuation increases with mixing duration, probably due to 
the friction of ultrasound propagated in gelation obviously 
affected by the gel viscosity, which may tend some 
ultrasonic energy to be adsorbed and tuned into heat.  
The California Mastitis Test (CMT) has popularly been 
used as a qualitative cow-side test for mastitis and relies on 
the fact that the viscosity of the non-Newtonian gel formed 
during the test is proportional to the somatic cell 
concentration. In this study pulse-echo ultrasonic technique 
is used to preliminary investigate the ultrasonic 
characteristics in gelation reaction of CMT. However, there 
is a need for further identifying for SCC concentrations 
relative to accuracy of CMT rank using ultrasonic 
technology in the future.
