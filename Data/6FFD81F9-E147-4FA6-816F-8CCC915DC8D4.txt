Abstract -- A defected spiral metal-coil design 
that can improve the performance of an on-chip 
spiral inductor is proposed and developed in this 
project. This defected metal-coil design is formed 
by a spiral metal trace with several slits dug in 
the metal coils. By the proposed defected 
metal-coil design, the metal resistance can be 
reduced and thus improve the quality factor 
(Q-factor) of an on-chip spiral inductor. Since 
only modifications on the layout of the spiral 
metal are required, this design can be easily 
implemented by the standard IC fabrication 
processes. To investigate improvement on the 
Q-factor carried out by the proposed design, 
electromagnetic simulations and experimental 
studies have been conducted to analyze the 
characteristics of the modified spiral inductors. It 
is observed that the proposed design can 
effectively increase the Q-factor of an inductor, 
indicating this design is suitable for improving 
the spiral inductors. In addition, equivalent 
circuit models for the modified inductors have 
been developed to characterize the circuital 
performances of the modified inductors, from 
which the performances of the modified 
inductors are physically interpreted.

1. INTRODUCTION 
With the rapid growth of the demand for 
low-power, low-cost, and high-integration wireless 
communication systems, the development of on-chip 
passive devices for Si-based radio frequency 
integrated circuits (RFICs) has emerged as a critical 
issue recently. Among the passive circuit designs, 
on-chip spiral inductors are particular important and 
widely used in RFICs such as mixers, low-noise 
amplifiers, and oscillators. Since the performances 
of an on-chip spiral inductor are principally 
controlled by the quality factor (Q-factor), the 
improvement of the Q-factor has therefore became a 
important issue in the design of a spiral inductor. It 
is well known that the Q-factor of a Si-based spiral 
inductor is mainly determined by three technology 
parameters, that is, (1) the resistive loss of the metal 
line, (2) the substrate loss of the silicon buck, and (3) 
the parasitic capacitance of the insulating oxide 
layers. By using advanced micromachining 
technologies, various novel spiral structures have 
been proposed to alleviate the loss of silicon 
substrate and the parasitic oxide capacitance [1]-[6]. 
In general, these designs can greatly improve the 
Q-factor of RFIC inductors, but they could be much 
 3
magnetic field would pass the outer metal coils.  
Based on this observation, we adopted the defected 
metal coil design, that is, dug several slits in the 
inner metal coils to interface the eddy current. These 
slits would make the net current distribution more 
uniform on the strip and thus minimize the metal 
loss caused by the eddy-current. On the contrary, the 
metal loss of the outer coils is mostly governed by 
the ohmic loss. The outer coils are therefore 
designed by the original layout without any 
modification. 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
To test the proposed improved spiral inductor 
design, 4.5-turns rectangular spiral inductors with 
and without the defected metal-coil design have 
been fabricated and measured to perform the 
experimental verification. The inductors were 
implemented in the TSMC 0.18 µm Mixed Signal 
RF General Purpose Standard Process supported by 
CIC. The spirals with metal thickness about being 
2 µm were fabricated on the metal-6 layer, and the 
underpass was deposited on the metal-5 layer. The 
line width W, line spacing S , and inner diameter D 
are 16, 2 and 80 µm, respectively. For the modified 
inductor designed by the defected metal coil, two 
silts with width being 2 µm were dug in the most 
inner coil. Also, the measured raw data are 
de-embedded with a two-step (open and short) 
procedure to remove the undesired pad parasitics. 
Fig. 3 compares the measured series inductance Ls 
(=Im[-1/ωY12]) and Q-factor of the inductor with 
and without the defected metal-coil design for the 
tested rectangular spirals. The basic performances of 
these two inductor designs are summarized in Table 
I. While the inductance is almost identical, the 
Q-factor is found to be significantly improved from 
Qmax = 9.87 to 10.80 by using the defected 
metal-coil design. There is about 10% improvement 
in the Q-factor performance achieved by the 
proposed modified inductor design.  
To reveal the suppression on the metal loss by 
using the proposed defected metal-coil design, the 
equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. 4 is adopted 
to characterize the studied spiral inductors. This 
enhanced π circuit model was proposed in [11] and 
the circuit elements in the model can be 
systematically extracted [12]. Also, the metal loss of 
the spiral inductor can be readily interpreted by the 
series resistances RS0 and RS1. At low frequency 
band, the metal resistance can be approximated by 
RS0 being parallel with RS1 (RS0 // RS1). On the other 
hand, the metal loss would be dominated by the 
resistance RS0. Table II lists the extracted circuit 
elements of the equivalent models for the modified 
and conventional rectangular inductors. It can be 
observed the slits introduced by the defected 
metal-coil design would slightly increase the metal 
resistance at low frequency. However, as the 
frequency increases, the contribution of eddy current 
to the metal resistance would be also increased. A 
significant reduction on the high-frequency metal 
resistance RS0 can be therefore achieved by the 
defected metal-coil design.

A defected spiral metal-coil design that can improve the performance of an on-chip 
spiral inductor is proposed and developed in this study. This defected metal-coil 
design is formed by a spiral metal trace with several slits dug in the metal coils. By 
the proposed defected metal-coil design, the metal resistance can be reduced and thus 
improve the quality factor (Q-factor) of an on-chip spiral inductor. Since only 
modifications on the layout of the spiral metal are required, this design can be easily 
implemented by the standard IC fabrication processes. It has been found that the 
proposed design can effectively increase the Q-factor while has negligible influence 
on the inductance of an on-chip inductor, indicating this design is suitable for 
improving the spiral inductors. In addition, equivalent circuit models for the modified 
inductors have been developed to characterize the circuital performances of the 
modified inductors, from which the performances of the modified inductors are

Abstract — This work presents a series of investigations on
the design of a coaxial combline filter using stepped-impedance
coaxial resonator (SIRs). First, a full-wave EM simulation code
based the finite-element method (FEM) is developed to analyze
the resonances a coaxial stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) with
a tuning screw. The couplings of the fundamental and high-order
resonant modes between a pair of SIRs are also investigated by
the FEM simulation. A modified coupling scheme that can
effectively suppress the coupling of the high-order modes while
provide the required coupling of the fundamental mode
simultaneously is then proposed to construct the filter with good
spurious performance. Based on the above investigations, a five-
pole Chebyshev band-pass filter is designed using the sequential
design procedure. The designed filter is also fabricated and
measured. Good agreements between the measured and
simulated results are observed, which validate the presented
investigations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Coaxial combline filters have been widely employed in
base stations for their compact, low loss and medium power
handling capability. One important consideration of the
coaxial combline filters is their spurious performances. It has
been reported that the coaxial stepped-impedance resonators
(SIRs) can be used to effectively improve the spurious
performances of a coaxial combline filter [1]-[3]. However,
the characterization of the resonances of a coaxial SIR and
the coupling among a pair of SIRs have not yet been much
explored. In general, the analysis of such three-dimensional
SIRs and coupling schemes is much more complicated than
the planar counterpart. In addition to the pure TEM or quasi-
TEM modes, non-TEM higher-order modes, especially the
TE11 mode, may also be excited and propagate in the low-
impedance section of the coaxial SIR. The resonant mode
involves the TE11 in the low-impedance section and the TEM
in the high-impedance section is named as the hybrid higher-
order resonant mode hereafter. In the investigation of the
spurious performances of a coaxial combline filter, the
contributions of the TEM higher-order mode and the hybrid
higher-order mode should be considered together.
In this work, we tempts to present a thorough study on the
researches of a coaxial combline filter using SIRs. First, a
full-wave EM simulation code based the finite-element
method (FEM) [4] is developed to characterize the
resonances of a coaxial SIR with a tuning screw. Two basic
coupling schemes are also analyzed by the FEM simulation to
study the couplings between two identical SIRs. A modified
coupling structure is then proposed to suppress the high-order
modes and pass the fundamental mode simultaneously.
Finally, a five-pole combline Chebyshev bandpass filter is
designed and measured to verify these investigations
experimently.
II. COAXIAL SIRS AND COUPLING SCHEMES
To design the coaxial combline filter having good spurious
performance, we first analyze the coaxial SIRs and the
coupling schemes. Fig. 1 shows the coaxial SIR to be studied.
It consists of two cascaded air-filled coaxial transmission line
segments, which have characteristic impedances Z1 and Z2
respectively, and a tuning screw modeled by the other
transmission line segment of the characteristic impedance Z3.
The first three resonant modes of the SIR are the fundamental,
TEM higher-order, and hybrid higher-order mode,
respectively. Their resonant frequencies are denoted by f0, f1,
and f2 in this work. For achieving good spurious suppression,
the SIR having high frequency ratios f1 / f0 and f2 / f0 would
be desired. This can be obtained by designing the impedance
ratio K = Z2 / Z1 to be smaller than one [5]. In addition, it is
found, form the FEM analysis, that the ratios f1 / f0 and f2 / f0
can be controlled by the length ratio u = L2 / ( L1 + L2), and
the maximum values of the f1 / f0 occurs around u = 0.4 for
the current case. We therefore adopt the parameters K = 0.3
and u = 0.4 in the following investigations.
Fig. 1. The coaxial SIR with a tuning screw.
Next, the coupling between a pair of coaxial SIRs is
considered. Following the researches shown in [6], two basic
types of coupling schemes, see Fig. 2, are used to study the
couplings between two SIRs. In Fig. 2(a), the electric type

larger than 8 mm. The reason of this large variation is that the
slot opening near the low-impedance section greatly disturbs
the field distribution in this region. The eigen-frequencies of
the hybrid mode are thus greatly altered. The large difference
means a large coupling for this hybrid high-order mode.
Furthermore, the value of mf2 is falling below
ef1 and
mf1 as h is greater than 10 mm (Fig. 2(a)) or 16 mm (Fig.
2(b)). These phenomena should be avoided in order to
suppress the coupling of the hybrid high-order mode.
Therefore, Fig. 2(b) would be a better choose and the value
of h should be as small as possible.
Fig. 5. The proposed coupling scheme to suppress the coupling
of the first high-order TEM mode. Parameters: a1 = 2 mm, b = 5
mm, g = 2.5 mm, LT = 21.5 mm, u = 0.4, K = Z2 / Z1 = 0.3, w = 8
mm, s = 1 mm, sep = 11 mm.
In designing a filter with both good passband and spurious
responses, the couplings of the fundamental mode should
have a set of particular values, while the coupling of the first
high-order mode should approach zero. It is not easy to meet
the two requirements simultaneously. In this work, a
modification of Fig. 2(b), see Fig. 5, is proposed to suppress
the coupling of the first high-order TEM mode and allow the
coupling of the fundamental mode. Keeping a small value of
h can also suppress the coupling of the second hybrid high-
order mode. The physical sizes of the proposed scheme,
which are listed in the caption of Fig. 5, are basically the
same as those of Fig. 2. For an individual SIR, the resonant
frequency of the first high-order TEM mode is at least five
times greater than that of the fundamental mode. The
variation of the slot offset d is used to minimize the coupling
of the first high-order TEM mode. The size of h can design
the required coupling of the fundamental mode. Fig. 6 shows
the variations of the coupling coefficients of these two modes
over d for h = 4 and 5 mm. It is seen that the coupling of the
first TEM high-order mode reach a minimum area when d is
in the range of 4 to 6 mm. The coupling of the fundamental
mode has a noticeable change over h in this range. This
indicates the proposed coupling scheme can meet the two
design requirements described above.
Experiments have been conducted to verify the simulation
results of the proposed coupling scheme. In the experiment,
two coaxial connectors are loosely coupled to the two SIRs
respectively. The frequencies of the two transmission peaks
for each mode are measured. The coupling coefficient is
calculated using these two frequencies. The experimental and
simulation results agree to a reasonable degree for the
couplings of the fundamental mode. For the first high-order
TEM mode, the two transmission peaks merge together when
d is in the ranges of 2 to 8 mm for the case h = 4 mm and 2 to
6 mm for the case h = 5 mm. These result in a vanishing
coupling in these ranges. The experimental results agree with
those of simulation outside these ranges.
Fig. 6. The variations of the coupling coefficients for the
fundamental and the TEM high-order modes over the slot offset d
for two different slot height h of the coupling scheme in Fig. 5.
IV. THE DESIGN OF BANDPASS FILTERS
Using the coupling scheme in Fig. 5, a five-pole
Chebyshev bandpass filter is designed. The filter has the
center frequency f0 = 2GHz, fractional bandwidth Δ= 0.02
and ripple value 0.01dB. The coupling matrix of the direct-
coupled filter can be easily calculated by the formulas given
in [7]. Fig. 7 shows the structures of the designed filter. The
SIRs in the filter have the same parameters as those shown in
the caption of Fig. 5, which are found to have the frequency
ratios f1 / f0 = 5.08 and f2 / f0 = 6.06. Only a half of the
structure needs design because there is a symmetric plane at
the geometric center of the filter. The depth, sLi, of the ith
tuning screw can vary the resonant frequency of the ith
resonator. Two coaxial cables feed the first and last
resonators at the position p. The coupling is designed by
varying the slot height h and offset d. Also shown in Fig. 7
are four cylindrical cavities for installing springs, which are
not shown here. This design makes the offset d and hence the
couplings mechanically adjustable by a coupling screw, not
shown here, above the slot.
It needs eight filter parameters to design the filter plotted in
Fig. 7. These parameters can be efficiently calculated by the
sequential design method [8]. The obtained results, after the
sequential design procedures, are listed in the caption of Fig.
7. In addition, to conduct the experimental verification of this
study, the designed filter is fabricated and measured. The
photo of the fabricated filter is inserted in Fig. 8, where the
five tuning (black) and four coupling (silver) screws can be
easily identified.
Fig. 8(a) compares the simulated and measured passband
responses of the designed filter with those of the equivalent
circuit. The center frequency of the designed filter is 2.009
