property is ²-testable (or simply testable) if the property has a tester, and
the total number of queries is o(n2).
The testing of graph properties was pioneered by Goldreich, Goldwasser
and Ron [9]. They show that all graph properties describable by the exis-
tence of a partition of a certain type are testable. Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich
and Szegedy show that every first-order undirected graph property without
a quantifier alternation of type ”∀∃” has ²-testers whose query complexity
is independent of the size of the input digraph [3]. The testing of other
graph properties and combinatorial properties has been intensively stud-
ied [4, 5, 7, 10, 11].
This project proves that the edge density of a k-connected graph or a
k-edge-connected graph cannot be too large. Then we prove that for input
parameter n, if k is a constant and the input parameter ² is not very small,
then k-connectedness is testable. Furthermore, we prove that when k = ρn
for some constant ρ > 0, k-edge-connectedness is testable too.
3 Preliminaries
Let 0 < ² < 1, n ∈ N and Π be a property of graphs, that is, a family of
graphs closed under isomorphism. An n-vertex graph G = (V,E) is ²-close
to having property Π if there exists an n-vertex graph G′ = (V,E′) having
property Π such that the symmetric difference between E and E′ is at most
²
(
n
2
)
. In this case, G′ can be constructed from G by adding and deleting no
more than ²
(
n
2
)
edges. We say that a graph G is ²-far from having property
Π if it is not ²-close to having property Π.
A tester is a randomized algorithm that is given as input a pair (n, ²) and
a graph G with n vertices. Here, n is a size parameter, and ² is a distance
parameter. The tester can make queries as to whether an edge of G exist.
The randomized algorithm is an ²-tester T for Π if for every G = (V,E) and
every 0 < ² < 1, the following two conditions hold:
(1) If G has property Π, then Pr[T accepts G ]≥ 2/3.
(2) If G is ²-far from having property Π, then Pr[T accepts G ]≤ 1/3.
The edge density of an n-vertex graph G = (V,E) is defined as |E|/(n2).
Let X ⊆ V and Y ⊆ V . The number of edges between X and Y is denoted
by e(X,Y ), and the edge density between X and Y is denoted by d(X,Y ) =
e(X,Y )
|X||Y | . If X and Y are disjoint and 0 < λ < 1, we say the pair (X,Y ) is
λ-regular if, for all A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y satisfying |A| > λ|X| and |B| > λ|Y |,

Fact 3.4. (Chernoff bound)
(1) Let Xi be 0 or 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and X = X1+X2+ · · ·+Xn be a sum
of n independent random variables such that 0 < Pr[ Xi = 1 ] < 1
holds for each i = 1, 2, ..., n and µ = E[X]. Then for any positive
number ∆ ≤ 2e− 1,
Pr[ X > (1 + ∆)µ ] < e−µ∆
2/4
where e is the base of the natural logarithm.
(2) Let X = X1 + X2 + · · · + Xn be a sum of n independent random
variables such that 0 < Pr[ Xi = 1 ] < 1 holds for each i = 1, 2, ..., n
and µ = E[X]. Then for any 0 < ∆ < 1,
Pr[ X < (1−∆)µ ] < e−µ∆2/2
where e is the base of the natural logarithm.
Definition 3.5. Let 0 < λ, d < 1, m,n ∈ N. Let M(λ,m) and N(λ,m) be
defined in Fact 3.1, ∆ = 2M(λ,m)/3, δ = d− λ and λ0 = δ∆/(2 + ∆) that
furthermore satisfy the following relationships:
(1) (1− λ)m2 > [(2m/3− 1)3/mm2−3/m] /2 + [(m/3− 1)m]/2;
(2) λ < λ0;
(3) λ0n/M(λ,m) > 1.
Then we say (n, λ,m, d) satisfies condition A.
If (n, λ,m, d) satisfies condition A, then it can be proved that
(1− λ)i2 >
[
(2i/3− 1)3/ii2−3/i
]
/2 + [(i/3− 1)i]/2
for all integer i > m.
4 Main Result
Lemma 4.1. Assume (n, λ,m, d) satisfies condition A. If G = (V,E) is
a k-connected graph with n vertices, then there exists an integer k′ such
that there are two disjoint vertex-sets Vi, Vj ⊂ V with size n/k′ each and
d(Vi, Vj) ≤ d+ k−1n/k′ .
