Introduction
Balance involves a number of body systems working in conjunction: the visual system; the
neuro-muscular-skeletal system; the vestibular system; and the proprioceptive system. Good
coordination between all these systems is needed to improve the balance control in a child.
Balance can be improved with specific treatment or training. A proper assessment should be
made so that the child's strengths and weaknesses can be identified. However, most children with
developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have balance deficits. They seem to be constantly
knocking things over, slipping on floors, and falling off equipment or down the steps in the
playground, at school, and at home. From earlier time, DCD is a problem which observes from
school teacher or parents, they discovered this kind of child act clumsy, uncoordinated also
frequently is unable independently to complete the craft lesson and the confession item. In the
sports class hour, he/she is usually unable to follow the movement and also difficult to learn a
new task.
The term“Developmental Coordination Disorder”was adopted by the American Psychiatric
Association (APA) to describe children with of normal intelligence, free of neurological diseases
and pervasive developmental disorders, those who lack the motor coordination necessary to
perform age-matched motor tasks (APA, 2000). It has quoted a 6% prevalence of school-aged
children. The child with DCD will appear to be clumsy and awkward and will have difficulty in
learning and performing new motor tasks. In children with psychomotor problems, DCD is a
diagnosis which is easily neglected, because it is difficult to identify by neurological or
chromosomal examinations (Wright & Sugden, 1996; Geuze, Jongmans, Schoemaker, &
Smits-Engelsman, 2001). Current researchers in the area of DCD report that the children do not
outgrow clumsiness and that, without intervention, they will not improve (Smyth, 1992, Sugden
& Chambers, 1998, Coleman, Piek, & Livesey, 2001, Schoemaker, van derWees, Flapper, 2001).
Losse et al (1991) tested 17 children aged 6 years and retested them at age 16 years. The children
with motor difficulties at 6 years of age continued to exhibit problems at 16 years of age.
Although it was not definitely defined in diagnosis and some confusion can be found, the
etiology of DCD usually refers to the disruption of perceptual and motor control mechanisms
(Willoughby & Polatajko, 1995; Dewey &Wilson, 2001). The disruption of perceptual function
might include visual perception, kinesthetic perception, and cross-modal perception. In the area
of motor control, it includes the problems of response selection and motor programming
(Willoughby et al, 1995; Wilson & Mckenzie, 1998; Pless & Carlson, 2000).
Many researchers purport that the motor coordination problems evident in DCD are the
result of perceptual and cognitive processes (Laszlo & Bairstow, 1983; Laszlo, Bairatow, Bartrip
& Rolfe, 1988; Smyth, 1991; Wilson & McKenzie, 1998). Schoemaker et al. (2001) have
hypothesized that visual, proprioceptive, and/or tactile processing deficits would be found in the
majority of children with DCD, the tests did show pronounced differences in motor-visual
integration between the groups, suggesting that children with DCD may not necessarily have
problem processing outside spatial information, but rather integrating that into the proper motor
functions and sequences (Schoemaker, van der Wees, Flapper, Verheij-Jansen, Scholten-Jagers,
& Geuze, 2001).
Mon-Williams et al. investigated the visual-proprioceptive mapping ability of children with
DCD. They were found significantly poorer than control children on all matching tasks. They
therapist. DCDQ was administered to the parents of the children. The screening criterion in
M-ABC is a score lower than 15 % of the norm i.e., a ranking above the 15th percentile
(Henderson and Sugden, 1992). Table 1 shows the screening criteria for the identification of
DCD.

Electronic Mobile Tilt-board
An electronic mobile tilt-board was used in this study to conduct the experiments of
kinesthetic measurement and the interactive muscles activation in balance control. The whole
structure is fitted with a sophisticated network of sensors that are capable of detecting every
single subject / mobile tilt-board movement interaction. The movement resistance of the tilting
board can be adjusted manually. The gradation of piston offers a continuing interval of ten
positions, starting from a minimum resistance (position 1) to a maximum resistance (position 10).
Then force-absorbers can stay in "lock", providing almost the total block of the pistons’stem.
When the subject interacts with the tilting board, the data of angular movement can be acquired
to the PC. The system's main electrical features are the following: Microprocessor board power
requirements provided directly by the USB. Signal recording with a sampling frequency of 20 Hz.
Input signal filtering by means of a combination of analogue and digital filters.
Tasks and Measures
The purpose of this test is to provide an objective assessment of the subtle coordination of
the subject's foot. To reduce the effect of visuomotor and cognitive function, the coordination test
in this study will be conducted without any visual or memory load. Subjects were requested to
perform full range ankle dorsal/plantar flexion and eversion/inversion 5 times. In the whole test
session, the movement of testing leg will be concealed by a shelter above the thigh of the subject.
This test is designed as a goal directed task. The guide for the goal of task is pure dorsal/plantar
or inverted/everted direction. Figure 1a is an illustrative result of dorsal/ plantar task. A1 and A5
are the directions of plantar and dorsal flexion respectively. A7 and A3 are for eversion and
inversion. On the flat view, the distancefrom every point on the excursion to the midline (R’) 
will be summed and averaged as an index for coordination measurement named mean deviated
distance (MDD). Before obtaining the midline (R’), alinear regression of the points on excursion
is conducted to get the regressive line (R). After rotating to be parallel with A1A5 at the midpoint
of R, the midline (R’) can be therefore determined. Figure 1b shows the line R’on the graphic
view. The MDD is the average distance from the points of excursion to the midline R’. Figure 2

Table 2 shows the result of coordination and kinesthetic measurements between DCD and
control group. In the result, the DCD group shows larger deviated trajectories in dorsi/plantar
flexion and inversion/eversion tasks. The time and trajectory to resume balance were also found
significantly greater in the DCD group

一、研習心得
International Conference of Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)是兩年舉辦一次的國際研討
會，兩年舉辦一次的原因是國內生物醫學工程學會也在年底舉辦國際研討會，所以兩地都是
隔年舉辦以相互錯開，然而國內該研討會於西元 2000 年之後就停辦了，新加坡國立大學則繼
續舉辦且持續擴大規模，研討會在新加坡市的 Suntec Convention Center 舉行，共有來自歐亞
大洋洲共三十幾個國家的 1000 位以上 Biomedical Engineering相關領域的 Primary Investigators
共同參與。會議的主要 Lecture 在第一天由 Columbia University 的 Professor William R Kenan
主講，講題為 Shaping Cells by Force and Rigidity through Protein Stretching，Professor Kenan
是哥大 Department of Biological Sciences 的教授，其演講主題是新近最熱門的組織工程的課
題，內容包括以力量為基礎的細胞訊號傳遞的 mathematical model，cell 的產生製造與 perfusion
及 cell membrane 與 cell skeleton 粘連等議題。
會議從 2008 年 12 月 3 日開始，總共進行 4 天的會議，有來自世界各地 30 餘國的醫學工
程研究者與會，雖然是在亞洲且大多為華人的國家所辦的國際研討會，非華人參與的比例相
當高，相較於國內的相關國際研討會有很大的不同，會議的會場是在 SUNTECT Convention
Center，位於新加坡市的市政中心區，會議的場館有一大型視聽會議室及兩旁各四間研討會
議室，中間區域為壁報展示區，會議第一天當天
本次會議中由美國 University of Maryland 學者 Alon 等所組成的研究團隊發展一個全新的
復健治療方式，該研究成果可以提供本研究小組很多新的思考方向與新構想，該團隊發展出
一套整合功能性電刺激與肌電訊號回饋系統的新技術，可以藉由肌肉收縮與提供患者運動感
