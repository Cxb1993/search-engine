本計畫提出一套自動且具強健性之之電泳圖斑點之變形圖像之特徵班點比對與影像定位
法則心值的計算，因為所提方法使用前期計畫之電泳圖斑點偵測方法所得結果，並納入慎選
計算之標記點與轉換參數計算之控制點方式，故所提方法可得最佳配對結果。斑點偵測與
比對定位工作在電泳圖影像的研究工作中，佔有相當重要的影響性，若是斑點偵測的結果與
斑點比對工作方法可以容忍技術變形所產生的較大量的非幾何失真方式的變形，則對電泳圖

一、 報告內容 
(一) 前言 
變形圖樣之比對及定位是影像處理應用領域中的兩項重要工作，我們將針對強韌的
圖樣判別及影像定位方法進行研究並以二維電泳圖作為分析對象。 
蛋白質之二維電泳圖影像常有相當嚴重的非線性變形，因此傳統影像處理方式不易
達成良好的斑點定位結果。我們將分成二個階段來進行定位研究，第一階段為斑點偵測
階段，先在電泳圖的灰階方向取得斑點的切片並建成切片樹，再根據切片樹進行斑點偵
測。每個斑點之切片包含了斑點的相關資訊，而切片樹又包含切片之間的關聯資訊，故
可有效提升斑點偵測的精確度，同時解決現有商業軟體採用分水嶺法所引發的過度切割
問題，此部份研究工作已於上期計畫進行之中。 
在斑點比對階段，則以分佈關聯及鬆弛運算為基礎，使用疊代迴圈來處理電泳圖的
非線性變形。我們將分三個階段進行，在估算階段，利用斑點的分佈關聯來計算斑點間
的配對成本與鬆弛運算初始化所用的配對機率矩陣；在修正階段，使用鬆弛運算修正配
對機率矩陣，使斑點的配對達到整體一致性；在轉換階段，從配對的斑點中選出適當的
控制點以計算電泳圖之間的細版曲線轉換參數。藉著重複執行「估算–修正–轉換」可讓
斑點配對逐漸達到穩定狀態，因為所提方法納入慎選計算之標記點與轉換參數計算之控
制點，故所提方法可得最佳配對結果。 
 
 (二) 研究目的 
在上一期的研究計畫中（變形圖像之特徵斑點偵測法則之研究：NSC 97-2218-E-231 -004 
-），申請人已延續原先針對道路路標之圖樣判別方法，並針對變形更為嚴重的影像進行特徵
偵測進行相關之研究，且以生物科技中常使用的二維電泳圖影像為測試目標，分析提出一個
強韌的斑點圖樣之偵測判別方法，除將達成自動之斑點偵測外，並預計可將所偵測得到
之斑點進行可靠度之計算工作。 
本計畫將延續上年度申請人研究計畫之研究工作，將以上期計畫中之二維電泳圖影像所
獲得之穩定之特徵斑點偵測結果為基礎，進一步進行二張相同蛋白質所取得之二維電泳圖影
像（即對照組與比對組）之比對定位工作之研究，並將提出一套具有強健型特性之二維電泳
圖之斑點圖樣比對方法。 
總而言之，斑點偵測與比對定位工作在電泳圖影像的研究工作中，佔有相當重要的影響
性，若是斑點偵測的結果良好，且後續的斑點比對工作方法可以容忍技術變形所產生的較大
量的非幾何失真方式的變形，則對電泳圖之分析與蛋白質之缺陷研究工作將有很大的助益。
因此，申請人除在上一期之研究計畫中已提出了一套利用影像處理技術以進行強韌的斑點圖
樣之偵測判別方法並正進行研究工作之外，此次申請之研究工作將接續前期之工作進行斑
點特徵之比對工作，並期能結合前期之研究結果完成一套完整之自動化之二維電泳圖影像
之的斑點偵測與比對定位系統。 
 
(三) 文獻探討 
兩張二維電泳圖的斑點個別偵測完畢之後，接下來的工作便是進行兩張電泳圖影像

TRANSFORMATION LOOP IS EXECUTED ITERATIVELY UNTIL THE MATCHING CORRESPONDENCE 
BETWEEN SPOTS REACHES A STABLE STATE. SINCE SUBTLE SELECTION OF PROPER LANDMARK 
POINTS FOR MATCHING PROBABILITY COMPUTATION AND PIVOTAL CONTROL POINTS FOR 
TRANSFORMATION PARAMETER DETERMINATION ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROPOSED METHOD, 
OPTIMAL MATCHING RESULTS ARE OBTAINED. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SPOT 
MATCHING PAIRS CAN ACCURATELY BE IDENTIFIED. MORE IMPORTANT, THE PROPOSED MATCHING 
IS FULLY AUTOMATIC WITHOUT HUMAN INTERACTION AND IT HAS HIGHER ACCURACY THAN THE 
COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE IMAGEMASTER IN THE FULLY AUTOMATIC MODE.

1. Introduction 
Proteomics is the study of proteome, especially how proteins function in and around cells. It is often considered as 
the next step of genomics in the study of biological systems. However, it is much more complicated than genomics [4], 
because an organism’s genome is rather constant, yet a proteome differs from cell to cell and constantly changes 
through its biochemical interactions with the genome and the environment. Since proteins are directly involved in the 
biochemical processes of cells and will have differential expression between control and experimental cells, a better 
understanding of disease or biological characteristic may be achieved by identifying the differential expression of 
proteome between control and experimental samples. 
Quadroni and James [7] had described the global framework of proteome analysis, in which protein separation is one 
of the most important stages in the framework. Among all separation techniques, 2-DE gel [1, 4] is the best method to 
separate complex protein mixtures according to their charge and size. Spots in the gel are proteins migrated to specific 
locations. According to the differential expression of protein mixtures from control and experimental samples, the spots 
in gel may disappear, appear or change in size and intensity. By analysis of spot appearance in gel, differential protein 
expressions between various samples are obtained. Aiming at the automated analysis, the core task is to compare the 
two generated gel images related to the samples by aligning them effectively and accurately, which is known as image 
matching problem. However, the complexity in the sample preparation and running procedure causes different 
geometric distortions [1, 10] between gels, which in turn, increases the difficulty of spot detection and spot matching 
between gel images. Due to the volume data and technical noise originating from the image acquisition process, manual 
analysis of gel image is difficult without the help of computer software. Analysis of gel image by image processing 
software requires an image processing pipeline which may contain image correction, spot detection, spot quantification, 
spot registration, data presentation and interpretation. A comprehensive review of those computation techniques can be 
referred to [4]. 
The changes in observed data between different gels originate from both biological variation and technical variation 
[1]. Biological variation is corresponding to the true differences between different cell types, tissues or individuals. 
Technical variation is corresponding to systematic noise from the technique itself. Therefore, the gels may represent 
spatial variability within them so that the same protein spots may have different location in different gels. In the 
proteome analysis, gel images are compared to find any differential expression between the samples run on a series of 
2-DE gels. However, geometric distortion between gel images may increases the difficulties in gel images comparison. 
Image warping is often used to align two gel images that reduce the deformation between the gel images. 
Approaches to image warping can broadly be divided into feature-based and pixel-based as shown in Figure 1. In the 
7 
 
refinement phase, relaxation labeling is used to iteratively update the matching probability matrix to achieve global 
consistency. In the transformation phase, control points are subtly selected to calculate the thin-plate spline (TPS) 
parameters between the gel images. The TPS parameters are then used to transform the spots in a gel image closer to the 
corresponding spots in the other. The estimation-refinement-transformation loop is executed iteratively until the 
matching correspondence between spots reaches a stable state. Since subtle selection of landmark points for matching 
probability computation in the refinement phase and control points for transformation parameter determination in the 
transformation phase is involved in the proposed method, optimal matching results are obtained. 
The reset of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the proposed algorithm in detail. Section 3 
summarizes the experimental results. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 4, along with the recommendations for 
future research. 
2. Spot Matching for Gel Images 
2.1. Layout context for matching initialization 
Layout context is a descriptor defined for a point  and a point set   , , 	 , 
 to represent the spatial 
distribution of those points in  related to point . The layout context can be implemented as a histogram in the 
following way. A polar mesh of radius , is superimposed on the point  and enclose the point set  , as shown in 
Figure 3. The polar mesh is defined in polar coordinates with radial axis () and angular axis (). The polar mesh 
consists of    polar grids,   , , by equi-partitioning the radial axis to get  concentric circles, each of 
which is then equi-partitioned along the angular axis into  segments. The polar grids  ,  are indexed by  
in ascending order of radial coordinate from small to large followed by  in ascending order of the angular coordinate 
from small to large.

One-dimensional polar mesh to build layout context of a spot, with   36 is shown. (c) One-dimensional 
polar mesh to build layout context for a spot. 
The histogram of point occurring in polar grids,    ,  , is a     matrix and each element,  , , can be obtained by 
 ,   ! , " , for   1, … ,  and     1, … ,  , 1 
where !,  is the number of points belonging set " and located in polar grid , , 
and " is the number of elements in ". 
The matching cost based on layout context between two points, , and 
 , can then be calculated by χ test 
statistic as

2.2. Relaxation labeling for matching refinement 
Relaxation labeling originally proposed by Rosenfeld in 1976 is an iterative update procedure using contextual 
constraints to reduce ambiguities in image analysis. It has been applied to many areas of computation, particularly to the 
solution of simultaneous non-linear equations. 
Consider a set of objects U  V, … , VS, and a set of labels W  1, … , . We want to label each object of U 
with exactly one label of W. By some local measurement, let OXN denote the initial probability that object Y is 
assigned label Z. The vector M[N  ON, … , O7N is then denotes the initial probability distribution to assign labels to 
object  V , where  0 ] OXN ] 1, for  Y  1, … , ?  and λ  1, … ,  , and ∑ OXN`  1, for  Y  1, … , ? . By simply 
concatenating aMNb , … , MSNbcF  we obtain an initial weighted labeling assignment for the objects of U that will be 
denoted by MN d eS7, that is, 
MN  PON 	 O7NQ R QOSN 	 OS7N T.                                                                  7 
Also, it is supposed that labels do not occur independently on each other, but are subject to 
contextual constraints, which are expressed in terms of a 〖?   block matrix 
g  h g 	 g7Q R QgS 	 gS7i,                                                                     8  
where each g[` is a ?   matrix of nonnegative real-valued compatibility coefficients 
g[`  h X1,1 	 X1, Q R QX?, 1 	 X?, i.                                              9 
The coefficient Xk, l measures the strength of compatibility between Z on object V, and l 
on object Vm, i.e., high values correspond to compatibility and low values to incompatibility. 
The relaxation algorithm accepts the initial labeling MN  aMNb , … , MSNbcF as input, and updates it iteratively 
according to the constraint model to achieve global consistency. At step > 5 1, the labeling is updated according to 
OXLn  OXLoXL∑ OpLopLSp9 , for Y  1, … , ? and Z  1, … , ,    10 
where the denominator is simply a normalization factor, and

represents the strength of support that context gives to Z for being the correct label for V, at step q. 
Ideally, the relaxation process should evolve until a fixed point is reached. In practice, however, the algorithm is 
stopped when some termination criterion is satisfied. For example, it can terminate when the distance between

3. Divide the first gel image into ! uniformly sub-blocks, and divide candidate list into ! sub-groups 
according to the location of the first element of the index pair. 
4. For each sub-group  , Y  1, … , !, the y
/! index pairs with highest matching probabilities in  are 
selected as landmark pairs. If the number of index pairs in  is less than y
/!, then all index pairs are 
selected as landmark pairs. 
Figure 4 shows the idea of the definition of the compatibility coefficients using landmark pairs. For a spot =  in first 
gel =, we want to find the matching spot in the second gel >. Let =,{ , >
{  denotes a selected landmark pair. If > 
is the corresponding matching spot of =  in >, then the relation between > and >
{ must be similar to that between =  and =,{. Though, it is possible that =,{ , >
{  is not really a matching pair. The proposed matching algorithm 
adopts majority voting strategy to cope with this problem. In other words, the voting results depend on not only a single 
landmark pair but a set of landmark pairs. Generally, most of the landmark pairs will give prons to find right matching 
spot for = . Actually, this idea is similar to the principle of Hough transform. If the landmark =,{ is superimposed on >
{ and denoted as the new origin, , as shown in Figure 4(c), then it can be seen that the relation between > and >
{ is more similar to that between =  and =,{  than > and > does. Thus, landmark pair =,{ , >
{  has higher 
support factor for matching =  to > than to > and >.

Let V denotes the vector between spots  and V. The compatibility coefficient for supporting the correspondence

Note that v==,{ 1 >>
{v is the length of => in the triangle Δ=> of Figure 4(c). The support factors are then

which are then used in (13) to update matching probability matrix. 
2.3. Normalization of matching probability matrix 
After the matching probability matrix M is initialized by layout context, or updated by relaxation labeling, the 
matrix is converted to a generalized doubly stochastic matrix using iterated alternative row and column normalization

By using two separate TPS functions ª and « which model the displacement of the control 
points in the  and  direction, an interpolation function can be defined to map each point of the 
image into a new point in the image plane. i.e.,

If errors appear in the matching results, we use regularization to trade off between exact interpolation and 
minimizing the bending energy. The regularized TPS can be solved by replacing  in (24) with  5 Z­, where ­ is 
the !  ! identity matrix, i.e.,

where Z is the regularization parameter that used to control the amount of smoothing. If Z is zero, 
then the interpolation is exactly. 
The algorithm used in selecting control points for TPS transformation is similar to the selection of landmark pairs, as 
described in Subsection 2.2. The estimated TPS parameters are then used to transform the source gel to bring the 
individual spots to their respective corresponding spots in the target gel image. After TPS transformation, distance error 
for each matching pair can be calculated to show the transformation accuracy of the proposed method.

4. Conclusions 
An iterated approach based on layout context and relaxation labeling is proposed to cope with non-linear 
deformation of gel images. Layout context of a spot represents the relationship between the other spots and the spot 
under consideration. Matching cost for each spot pair is calculated by layout contexts of the respective spots, which in 
turn are used to initiate a matching probability matrix. Compatibility factors for each spot pair are calculated by the 
relationship between the respective spots and landmarks, which are used in the update sequence of relaxation labeling. 
The performance of the proposed spot matching is benefited by 1D instead of 2D mesh of layout context, proper 
landmark pairs for calculating compatibility factors, and pivotal control points for determining TPS transformation 
parameters. Experimental results show that, for the fully automatic mode, the proposed method has higher accuracy 
than the commercial software ImageMaster. Further research cab ne directed to handle the outlier problem and to 
extend the proposed method for sub-gel image matching.
