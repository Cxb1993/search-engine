摘要 
在本計劃中，我們根據IEEE 802.11n的
規範，考量可支援服務品質的機制，分析不
同優先權STA之間的封包負載長度(Payload 
Size)對系統傳輸效能之影響。分析結果顯
示，優先權高低對整體傳輸量會造成極大的
影響，我們也考慮在衰減通道有不同封包錯
誤率下，AP依據優先權順序，並且考量各
優先權之封包負載長度，給予適當的傳送機
會。透過此分析，在不同通道品質的環境
下，我們可以得到不同優先權之間最佳的負
載長度組合，以達到適應的傳送機會
(Adaptive TXOP)的目的。

Abstract 
In the project, we have analyzed the 
effect of payload size on the transmission 
efficiency of system between different priority 
stations based on the specification of IEEE 
802.11n and 802.11e. The analytical results 
illustrate that the longer payload size of 
different high priority stations will 
significantly affect the whole system 
performance. We also consider that AP is 
assigned a suitable TXOP according to the 
order of priority and payload size with 
different channel quality. By such analyses, 
we can obtain the optimal payload size to 
reach the best TXOP between different 
priority stations with different channel quality. 
  
Keywords: IEEE 802.11n, MAC Extension 
Techniques, TXOP, QoS. 
 
一、 前言 
近年來無線網路(WLAN)因其擁有可快
速佈置且容易維護成本低廉的特性，已經大
量地在各地方使用，但隨著網路多媒體應用
的需求不斷的增加，現有的無線區域網路傳
輸技術如IEEE 802.11a/b/g已不足以滿足其
要求。因此建構具有高傳輸速率、效率與提
供服務品質(QoS)的系統是目前最重要的課
題。 
在 現 實 生 活 中 所 使 用 的 IEEE 
802.11a/b/g規範中，並無確保服務品質機
制，以致於無法將封包(Packet)優先權區分
開來。 IEEE 802.11n將結合 IEEE 802.11e 
EDCA機制，不同優先權(Priority)的封包具
有不同的競爭(Contention)成功機率，以避免
封包發生碰撞。在IEEE 802.11n中高優先權
封包也將使用傳送機會(TXOP)機制確保封
包的傳送，以使得即時(Real Time)封包得以
在有效時間內傳送出去。目前IEEE 802.11n
標準還未定案，成立於西元 2005 年的
Enhanced Wireless Consortium (EWC)[1]是
為了加速IEEE 802.11n的演進過程且促進技
術的整合進而使規範(Specification)盡快確
定。繼之前通過第一版草案(Draft 1.0) [2]通
過目前 IEEE 802.11n 工作小組 (Working 
Group)於2007年3月中舉行的會議中，正式
投票通過 802.11n第二版草案標準 (Draft 
2.0)，而根據802.11n標準制定進度預估，

    利用推導出的馬可夫鏈模型分析在衰
減通道干擾下，假設雜訊干擾功率固定下，
討論不同優先權有不同封包大小對總傳輸
率的影響。透過分析結果，可以找出各種
class i 所對應最佳的封包大小，以分配最佳
的傳送機會(TXOP[i])時間給不同種類的使
用者運用，使得總傳輸量得以最佳化。 
四、 研究成果 
  首先，在理想通道狀況下，我們分析在
802.11n 中不同優先權封包對傳輸量的影
響。在圖二中，我們針對兩種優先權封包，
語音(Voice)封包和資料(Data)封包，進行系
統傳輸量的分析，參數如表一所示。明顯
地，優先權高的語音封包比優先權低的資料
封包具有更高的傳輸量，這是因為在理想通
道環境下，優先權高的語音封包比優先權低
的資料封包更容易獲得通道傳輸機會。隨著
封包長度的增加，語音封包和資料封包的傳
輸量也隨之增加，因為語音封包傳輸機會較
高，亦即語音封包可傳送的次數多於資料封
包可傳送的次數，因此語音封包的傳輸量變
化會比較明顯。經由圖二的分析，了解競爭

圖二、語音封包和資料封包對系統傳輸量關係圖

我們可以由不同的語音封包長度，配合相對
的最佳資料封包長度，在根據資料速率換算
出傳送所需花費的時間，並計算出其所需之 
TXOP[i]。 
五、 結果與討論 
經由我們的分析結果可以明顯地看出
在不同優先權STA之間的封包長度會互相
影響，然後，根據不同優先權的封包傳輸，
我們能夠從中選擇相對應的負載長度
(Payload Size)，進而使得系統傳輸量達到最
佳化。 
  經過前一年的訊框聚合分析，和今年不
同優先權STA的負載長度分析，我們可以清
楚地知道，當STA競爭得到通道後，AP可以
依據不同服務品質的負載長度和衰減通道
狀況有效率地給予適當的TXOP[i]，使得AP
整體傳輸量能達到最大化，且確保服務品
質。但是對於AP該如何動態地調整TXOP時
間來同時滿足各使用者傳送不同類型封包
的服務是值得探討的議題。

idea is to divide a region of interest (ROI) into several small 
regions. The total number of small regions in the ROI is 
defined as Z. If there is more than one sensor located in a 
small region, we only permit one sensor to be in the active 
mode and the others to be in the sleep mode in the small 
region at any time to prolong system lifetime [12, 13, 14]. 
The LEUD algorithm contains the following steps: 
1. Divide the ROI into several small regions: In order to 
make sensors within a one-hop distance communicate with 
each other, the farthest acceptable distance for one hop 
cannot exceed the sensors’ communication range (cR). With 
this constraint, the side length (x) of a small region and the 
number of small regions in the ROI can be calculated by 
using equations (1), (2), (3), and (4). Obviously, Z depends 
on the sensors’ cR, as shows in Figure 1. If we know the cR 
and area of ROI, we can get the Z regardless of the numbers 
of sensor in ROI. For example, ROI= 10x10m2, cR=5, 
calculate Z by equation (4), Z is not less than 20.
For a fixed N (N is the total number of sensors in the 
ROI), the smaller Z is, the larger the average number of 
sensors in a small region is. The period of system lifetime 
would be extended. Thus, in (4), we choose the lower bound 
of Z.

where x is the side length of a small region.  
2. Categorize the sensors into their own small regions: 
Each small region is distinguished by a 2-dimensional (x, y) 
coordinates. According to the location of each sensor, each 
sensor is integrated into its own small region and is 
represented by a 2-dimensional (x, y) coordinates. The 
2-dimensional (x, y) coordinates is taken as the ID of the 
sensor. The nodes which have the same ID will be located in 
the same small region.    
3. Set a sensor in a small region to active mode: If the 
number of deployed sensors in the ROI is fairly large, the 
number of sensors in a small region will be more than one. 
Under this condition, we set one sensor to active mode and 
the others to sleep mode. First, each sensor will establish its 
own energy table by receiving the energy information of 
neighboring sensors which have the same ID. Second, if the 
energy of a sensor is larger than the others in the energy 
table, the sensor is called the major node and will be set to 
active mode; otherwise, it will be set to sleep mode. 
4. Determine the system lifetime: After all the sensors 
have been set to their respective modes, the major node will 
sense targets or events. The battery leakage per unit time is 
defined as Continuous Power (CP) [15]. When the energy of 
the major node is lower than CP, the major node broadcasts 
a specific packet to the neighboring nodes which have the 
same ID. The purpose of the specific packet is to notify 
these nodes to re-select a new major node (the method of 
choosing a major node is given in step 3). We define the 
time when these sensors begin to monitor the sensing fields 
as the system initialization point. We define the first time 
when there are more than m% (m={10,20,…,90}) small 
regions inactive as the system termination point. The 
duration from the system initialization point to the system 
termination point is defined as system lifetime.  
 
III. DESCRIPTION OF MRDSR 
 
Under flat-based routing; a conventional sensor routing 
scheme include transfer data to the BS. Each sensor detects 
an event; it broadcasts the event to all sensors within a 
one-hop range. All the sensors within one hop then 
repeatedly broadcast the message to the next nodes. This 
scheme can lead to an excessive drain of limited battery 
power and increases collisions in wireless transmission. 
Therefore, an energy-efficient sensor routing scheme, 
namely Relative Direction based Sensor Routing (RDSR), 
was proposed [10]. That system model consists of a base 
station, several manager nodes, and a number of sensor 
nodes. The scheme divides the sensor field into sectors and 
places a manager node in each sector. The manager node 
receives the collected data from the sensors in its 
corresponding sector and then directly transfers the data to 
the BS through the shortest path of the 2-dimensional (x, y) 
coordinates. 
However, some problems may exist in the RDSR 
scenario. For example, on the sensor data convey step of the 
RDSR scenario, a routing loop problem shown in Figure 2 
could result when the sensors that select the next node 
satisfy the second step but do not satisfy the first step. 
In this theme; a modified Relative Direction-based Sensor 
Routing scheme is proposed to solve the routing loop 
problem and is described as follows: 
1. If there is a manager node within a 1-hop distance, that 
node is selected as the next node to deliver the event. 
2. Otherwise, a neighbor node with the smallest sector 
number is selected as the next node because it is closest to 
the BS. If more than one node has the same smallest sector 
number, the node with the most amount of power is 
preferred to balance power utilization. If more than one node 
has the same most amount of power, one of them is 
randomly selected as the mediator. 
In section 2, we explained that the LEUD algorithm uses a 
lifetime-extended system model. Assuming that the BS is 
located at the edge of an ROI, as shown in Figure 3, a major 
node within a small region can transfer data to the BS 
through a mediator. Only a major node can be regarded as a 
mediator at any time. To transmit a packet to the BS, we 
divide the ROI into several sectors based on the distance of 
what from the BS. Because the farthest small region from

Abstract -In digital communications, the constant
modulus algorithm (CMA) for blind channel
equalization has some disadvantage such as slow
convergence speed and phase rotation. Therefore, a
modified constant modulus algorithm was developed
for blind channel equalization. In this paper, we put
forward a novel receiver, which combines CMA blind
adaptive multiuser detection with particle swarm
optimization (PSO) algorithm in frequency domain
for Multi-carrier direct sequence code division
multiple access systems. To work around potentially
computational intractability, the proposed scheme
exploits heuristics in consideration of both global
and local exploration CMA. The simulation results
show that BER performance of the PSO-CMA blind
detection is superior to that of steepest decreasing
constant modulus algorithm (DSCMA), constant
modulus algorithm (CMA) based detection and the
complexity of the former is much lower than that of
the latter.
1. Introduction
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
is highly efficient data transmission ways, which has
very strong ability against multipath interference and
inter symbol interference (ISI). Code Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) is one of multiple access ways with
large capacity and spreading gain. The multicarrier
schemes which combine OFDM and CDMA mainly
include multi-carrier code division multiple access
(MC-CDMA) obtains frequency selective diversity,
however, frequency selective fading experienced by the
different subcarriers will destroy the orthogonally of
spreading codes in MC-CDMA [1-2]. In MC DS-CDMA
system, however, the multiple-access interference (MAI)
problem in the uplink is always encountered, even if
orthogonal spread codes are adopted by all users. The
MAI problem is particularly sever if there are some
users with a spreading code that is highly correlated
with the desired user's spreading code and or in near-far
scenarios. For the analogy between inter-symbol
interference (ISI) and MAI, some blind equalization
techniques, such as the constant modulus algorithm
(CMA) [3-10], were applied for multiuser detection. The
CMA [3] is a blind adaptive algorithm, i.e., it does not
require a training sequence. It is widely applied in the
array processing, equalization, and multiuser detection.
Unfortunately, the proposed conventional CMA was
based on a stochastic gradient descent form. The main
drawback of this algorithm is its slow convergence.
Although the anchored minimum output-energy (MOE)
detector [4] has a faster convergence, however, this
detector converges to scaled version of the minimization
of mean-square-error (MMSE) detector, which leads to a
loss of mean square error (MSE) performances
compared to training-based schemes. For improvement
on the tracking capability, the use of the linearly
constrained constant modulus algorithm (LCCMA) to

the Conventional CMA, a linear receiver is chosen

to the new velocities and locations calculated by (13)
and (14), and tend to cluster together from different
directions. Thus the evaluation of each associate fitness
of the new population of particles begins again. The
algorithm runs through these processes iteratively until
it stops. In this paper, the current position can be
modified by the following equation [17-18]:
Y=rmax -((/'max - Pmin )/itermax)) x iter (15)
where pUrax is the initial weight, pUrin is the final
weight, itermax is maximum number of iterations, and
iter is the current iteration number.

Figure 2 Flowchart of a PSO algorithm
The procedure of standard PSO can be summarized as
follows
Step 1: Initialization: Initialize a population of particles
with random positions and velocities, where each
particle contains K variable.
Step 2: Evaluate the fitness values of all particles, let
pbest of each particle and its objective value equal to its
current position and objective value, and let gbest and
its objective value equal to the position and objective
value of the best initial particle.
Step 3: Update the velocity and position of each particle
according to Equations (13) and (14).
Step 4: Evaluate the objective values of all particles.
Step 5: For each particle, compare its current objective
value with the object value of its pbest. If current value
is better, then update pest and its object value with the
current position and objective value. Furthermore,
determine the best particle of current warm with the best
objective values. If the objective value is better than the
object value of gbest, then update gbest and its objective
value with the position and objective value of the
current best particle.
Step 6: Termination criteria: If a predefined stopping
criterion is met, then output gbest and its objective value;
otherwise go back to Step 3.
IV. Simulation Results
Considering one synchronous MC -DS-CDMA
communication system, we adopt differential encoding
and QPSK mapping. The spreading code is Gold 31 and
the spreading gain is N=3 I.The number of subcarriers is
64. The number of active users is K=10 and the user 1 is
the desired user. The amplitude of fading of every
subcarrier has Rayleigh distribution and the phase has
uniform distribution. The fading of different subcarriers
of different users are assumed to be independent with
each other and to be invariable in detection process.
Figure 3 illustrates the average bit error rate (BER)
against input SNR for different algorithms. The
performance measure is signal to interference plus noise
ratio (SIR):

The SIRs versus number of iterations for the algorithms
are shown in figure 3. The signal to noise ratio is 20 dB.
It is shown that 1). PSO-CMA presents excellent SIR
performance especially in the low SNR, 2) PSO-CMA
presents better and faster convergent performance than
