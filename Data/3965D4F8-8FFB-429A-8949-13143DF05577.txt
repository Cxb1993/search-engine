1. INTRODUCTION 
Active surface measuring techniques have been used to automatically reconstruct 3D models by 
joining polygon meshes since 1994 [13]. The techniques enable highly accurate measuring of 3D 
surfaces. 3D range images were also used in measuring dimensions of archeology and engineering 
site[4,6] with high precision 3D coordinates and correct 3D inter-relationship between parts. The 
measurement is made by scanning laser beams in a non-intrusive manner. The scanned parts are shown 
in as-built form with surface configuration recorded for follow-up drafting needs. 
Traditional representation of architectural design information was mainly illustrated through 2D 
vector drawings and 3D computer models before construction. The data of real world used to be 
retrieved manually with limited assistance from survey instruments. On-site measurements are usually 
sampled in a discontinuous manner and subject to human errors. Missing accurate as-built spatial 
information may delay working schedule and miscount bill of materials (BOM). Wrong information 
may come from measurement mistake, dimensional misreading, or setup error. The types of 
measurement tolerance, which usually come from traditional working habit, can be accumulated to a 
certain amount and cause problems in installation and budget control. The digital representations are 
design-oriented data which are different from as-built information used for interior renovation or after-
construction facility management. The as-built data should include the most updated design 
modification or dimension adjusts made to the virtual design environment.  
Traditional architectural graphic data do not support the spatial representation of as-built 
environment. Even the data is represented, the amount and format of data is not suitable for the 
production environment in design practice. This study has combined the range images retrieved from a 
 4
amount of laser points. The resolution of a view can be increased by tiling scans with each the highest 
resolution from left to right and from top to bottom. Once a scan is done, its corresponding computer 
format is stored as the point cloud model. The cloud format can then be transferred into a polygonal 
model.

5. INTERIOR RENOVATION  
Based on the definition of local Building Technology Regulations, interior renovation specifies the 
works for space rearrangement, circulation, and the allocation of materials without changing original 
building usages. Renovation usually includes design, construction, and finishing stages. Upon to the 
client’s request, the design process starts from site survey, planning, space layout, detail design, 
defining specification, to construction preparation. A construction firm will be hired based on the 
design specifications under clearly defined contract and schedule to make sure the works are 
completed correctly and in a timely manner.  
The test case is a campus building interior renovation located in the Department of Architecture, 
NTUST. The floor area is shown in Appendix. Real construction took about 13 days to complete. 
6. 3D SCAN PROCESS 
In addition to represent the as-built space data in 3D form, scan data have to integrate with design 
data. So the scan procedure has to combine design inspection to create a new working process. Scan 
works are divided into stages, such as planning, on-site jobs, data editing, and publishing. 
1. planning stage:  
z Define scan region: based on the description of working drawings, target scan subjects, and 
spaces; 
z Scan planning: including objects and their locations for possible scan obstructions; 
z Schedule: planning scan schedule with construction schedule to retrieve the most updated 
data in time. 
2. scan stage: including preparation, execution, and edit of scans (Tab. 1). 
3. scan data editing:  
z cloud registration: Clouds are registered to show the dimensions of spaces as a whole.  
z cloud editing: Remove noise from each point cloud and slice clouds to show and export 
profiles. 
z working with CAD system: Export edited clouds to AutoCAD, a popular working platform, 
and merge with 2D vector drawings.

8. THE ANALYSIS OF CONSTRUCTION DATA 
Former research has accomplished 3D comparison of 3D scan data sets [5]. In this application, scan 
data are applied specifically to a better control of renovation quality. As shown in the system interface 
(Appendix), user can access scan data by dates and stages under design, construction, and post-
construction categories. As a result, the data are applicable along a building’s life cycle. The data 
analysis at design stage is related to drawing production, furniture system evaluation, and BOM. 
Registered point clouds verify the real structure plans through column and partition locations. Interior 
dimensions can be measured, noted, and compared with old drawings in higher accuracy. The plans 
then were used to evaluate furniture layout.   
Existing kitchen and interior partitions in room 807 and 808 were demolished. The demolition plan 
and range images (Fig.4) show the partitions and ceiling tiles had been removed on Dec. 12. New 
partitions proceeded before ceilings did. Both ceilings and HVAC were installed almost at the same 
time (Fig. 5). As former researches have been achieved [3,4] in 4D schedule simulation, this study 
added point cloud browser interface for a virtual 3D walk-through as a schedule inspection aid after 
scans were registered.

important for a proper layout of system furniture; however, scan data showed two mismatches:  
z Column size: The real column size should be 62cmX80cm, instead of 80cmX80cm. A 20 cm 
difference existed.  
z Wall location: A 39 cm difference existed between real wall location and drawing data (Fig. 
6). The actual room size was larger than what drawing indicated. The size mismatch lead to 
mistakes in BOM and furniture layout. 
3. Department office and library: New partitions were installed to separate a conference room into 
office and library. Ceiling remained. Three mismatches were found (Fig. 6): 
z Wall length: Wrong measurement of wall length turned out to be the key mistake that lead to 
other construction problems. 
z Wrong partition location: Previous wrong wall length lead to the partition located 31 cm to 
the left of the designed location. 
z Partition ran into opening: Due to the survey and construction errors, partition ran into an 
opening, instead of wall.  
 
10. POST-OCCUPANCY SCAN 
The scan data can be exported and classified by layers in AutoCAD. Point clouds with related 2D 
information were used as finished drawings for working schedule control in the middle of construction 
or even after spaces were occupied. In this study, related layers were overlaid to show the difference 
which will be referenced for future maintenance (Fig. 7). 
Graduate students and system furniture were moved in after renovation was completed. Whether the 
original design met user’s need, post-occupancy observation was conducted to reveal user response. 
Room 807 and 808 were originally designed for graduate students. After scans were made, the 
furniture layout showed a different use pattern while a classroom had become a seminar space. 
 
11. CONCLUSION 
This study was conducted space by space. Cases showed that incomplete design information lead 
to miss perception of inter-relationship among design components and consequently caused design or 
construction errors. The mistakes could be prevented by referring to the as-built scan data. This study 
also showed that only accurate design specifications can meet design requirements and prevent 
construction error. 
All the site jobs were conducted by a graduate student in 10 working days, out of a period of 48 
days. Although this case is considered as a pilot study, accurate as-built data and user-friendly internet 
interface could have solved design problem initially and improve construction quality without 
increasing working forces.

construction analysis [1,2,11]. 4D technologies have 
applied databases and 3D modeling tools to create time-
based construction descriptions as a means for facilitating 
inspection [8,9,10]. Links have been established between 
databases and corresponding 3D objects at specific time 
periods. The 3D models can be reviewed visually in 
different orientations to reveal construction conflicts early 
enough to make changes in the work schedule.  
The monitoring of a site and the correspondence of 
activities defined by a schedule requires object 
identification and a thorough record of site occurrences. To 
achieve this goal, time-based 3D (4D) monitoring focuses 
on a pre-construction study that will allow for better 
management of a site afterward [3]. However, a pre-
construction simulation cannot necessarily take into 
account every incident that might occur to the parts of a 
building under construction. 
4. A RANGE FINDER’S APPROACH 
Construction assessment using a laser range finder is a 
kind of non-intrusive scanning technology for data retrieval 
[12]. Cases have demonstrated that a laser scanner is a 
useful tool in either accessing data at a construction site or 
measuring data for interior billing of materials [3,5,6]. A 
scanner seems to be feasible to record ground profile in a 
large construction site with a demand for accuracy less 
than one centimeter, or for cost estimations of interior 
renovation. Being able to conduct scans of a large area and 
to inspect the dimensions of a small region at the same 
time would be an extension of a long-range laser scanner’s 
functionality that takes advantage of both types of 
measurements and displays.  
Combining laser ranging with commercial design 
software can model existing facilities four times faster than 
photogrammetry [1]. The range finder, which uses laser 
beams to locate the position of a point on a surface, has 
been used in construction for a long time. Recent 
developments in technology have enabled the tool to cover 
a large area for the continuous recording of a surface 
configuration. For example, rapid local area sensing and 
3D modeling was applied for better planning and control of 
construction equipment operation [7].  
This study tries to built-up a monitor procedure during 
the construction process. Instead of traditional discrete and 
point-based data survey, this study applied a long-range 3D 
laser scanner (Fig. 1) as a survey device for continuous 
data retrieval. It can reach 100 m and generate a 999x999 
laser dots at about 4 mm interval in 17 minutes. The 
distribution of dots is considered as a continuous sampling 
of x-, y-, z-coordinate of a particular component. Scans are 
conducted automatically. The sample points can be easily 
added up to millions. The initial cost of 3D long-range 
laser scanner is about $100000 USD, which is much higher 
than traditional tools do. 
Projection efficiency has also increased. If each point 
takes a total station about five seconds to aim, a laser 
scanner that projects 999*999 points in 999 seconds would 
be 4,995 times faster for the same amount of laser points. 
The resolution of a view can be increased by tiling scans 
with each the highest resolution from left to right and from 
top to bottom. Once a scan is done, its corresponding 
computer format is stored as the point cloud model. The 
cloud format can then be transferred into a polygonal 
model.

5. INTERIOR RENOVATION  
Based on the definition of local Building Technology 
Regulations, interior renovation specifies the works for 
space rearrangement, circulation, and the allocation of 
materials without changing original building usages. 
Renovation usually includes design, construction, and 
finishing stages. Upon to the client’s request, the design 
process starts from site survey, planning, space layout, 
detail design, defining specification, to construction 
preparation. A construction firm will be hired based on the 
design specifications under clearly defined contract and 
schedule to make sure the works are completed correctly 
and in a timely manner.  
The test case is a campus building interior renovation 
located in the Department of Architecture, NTUST. The 
floor area is shown in Appendix. Real construction took 
about 13 days to complete. 
6. 3D SCAN PROCESS 
In addition to represent the as-built space data in 3D 
form, scan data have to integrate with design data. So the 
scan procedure has to combine design inspection to create 
a new working process. Scan works are divided into stages, 
such as planning, on-site jobs, data editing, and publishing. 
1. planning stage:  
z Define scan region: based on the description of 
Existing kitchen and interior partitions in room 807 
and 808 were demolished. The demolition plan and range 
images (Fig.4) show the partitions and ceiling tiles had 
been removed on Dec. 12. New partitions proceeded before 
ceilings did. Both ceilings and HVAC were installed 
almost at the same time (Fig. 5). As former researches have 
been achieved [3,4] in 4D schedule simulation, this study 
added point cloud browser interface for a virtual 3D walk-
through as a schedule inspection aid after scans were 
registered.  
Scans were made in full scale to facilitate 
measurements in an internet browser mode. When scans 
were imported into vector drafting platform, data were 
scaled down to 1/100 or 1/200 to create the same 
comparison base with drawings. Overlapping design 
drawings with point cloud sections was found to be the 
most efficient and practical way to detect any possible scan 
error, comparing to tape or theodolite measures. Since 
most building parts were built orthogonally, the 
registration alignment can also be inspected easily.

 9. COMPARING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 
Post-construction scans helped create finish drawings 
to be compared with original design drawings for possible 
differences at several locations.  
1. Lobby and corridor: Only ceiling at this area was 
renovated. Comparing the design and as-built data, 
real wall location was found to be offset 27.83 cm 
sideway and actual elevator opening width was 6.38 
cm less (Fig. 6). 
2. Classrooms: Room 806-808 had demolition, ceiling, 
and HVAC jobs. Room dimension was important for 
a proper layout of system furniture; however, scan 
data showed two mismatches:  
z Column size: The real column size should be 
62cmX80cm, instead of 80cmX80cm. A 20 cm 
difference existed.  
z Wall location: A 39 cm difference existed 
between real wall location and drawing data 
(Fig. 6). The actual room size was larger than 
what drawing indicated. The size mismatch lead 
to mistakes in BOM and furniture layout. 
 
 
Room 806: Ceiling, which included lighting fixture and air ducts, was 
almost done. 
 
Room 807: Workers were installing ducts with some ceiling tiles removed. 
 
Room 808: Room 808, next to 807, shared the same corridor. Air ducts 
were installed at the same time. Range image showed uninstalled ceiling 
tiles and exposed wires.

installed to separate a conference room into office 
and library. Ceiling remained. Three mismatches 
were found (Fig. 6):
