Abstract
Causal analysis largely influences the effectiveness of decision-making and the productivity
of actions. The complex relationships between cause and effect as well as the fuzzy nature of
human life make the casual analysis a difficult work. In this paper, we develop a fuzzy
DEMATEL method for group decision-making to gather group ideas and analyze the cause-effect
relationship of complex problems in fuzzy environments. Procedures of the fuzzy DEMATEL
method are then proposed. By the fuzzy DEMATEL procedures, the involved criteria of a system
(or subsystem) are separated into the cause group and effect group for helping decision-makers
focusing on those criteria that provide great influence. An empirical study applies the proposed
fuzzy DEMATEL method to the R&D project selection of a Taiwan company. The result shows,
within the cause group, the criterion of “probability of technical success” is the most important 
factor for R&D project selection, whereas the “strategic fit” has the best efect on the other
criteria. By contrast, the “net present value” is the most easily improved of the effect group
criteria.

Definition 2.2.6. A causal diagram can be acquired by mapping the ordered pairs of (Dk + Rk , Dk
Rk), where the horizontal axis (D + R), named “Prominence”, is made by adding Rk
to Dk , and the vertical axis (DR), named “Relation”, is made by subtracting Rk from
Dk .
The horizontal axis “Prominence” of the causal diagram shows how important the criterion 
is, whereas the vertical axis “Relation” may divide the criteria into the cause group and efect 
group. Generally, when the value (DkRk) is positive, the criterion belongs to the cause group. If
the value (Dk Rk) is negative, the criterion belongs to the effect group. Hence, causal diagrams
can visualize the complicated causal relationships between criteria into a visible structural model,
providing valuable insight for problem solving. Further, with the help of a causal diagram, we
may make proper decisions by recognizing the difference between cause and effect criteria.
3. The procedure of the proposed method
The analytical procedure of the proposed fuzzy DEMATEL method is briefly described as
follows.
Step 1: Identify the decision goal and form a committee.
8Step 4: Acquire the normalized direct-relation fuzzy matrix
The linear scale transformation is used as a normalization formula to transform the criteria
scales into comparable scales. Let

.
Fuzzy matrix X~ is called the normalized direct-relation fuzzy matrix. Here, we use the
arithmetic mean to aggregate, or pool, all the data across the experts after computing the
normalized direct-relation fuzzy matrix kX~ . This approach can make the differences of
individuals apparent, which is better than the way of aggregating all the data of the experts right
after obtaining the initial direct-relation fuzzy matrix kZ~ .
Step 5: Establish and analyze the structural model.
To compute the total-relation fuzzy matrix T~ , we have to ensure the convergence of
w

= 0 in advance. In computing wX~ , we apply the approximation formula (4) for
multiplication of two triangular fuzzy numbers. In fact, under the linguistic values of this paper,
formula (4) almost coincides with formula (3). Hence, the elements of wX~ are also triangular
fuzzy numbers.
Let ijx
~ = ( ij , ijm , iju ) and define three crisp matrices, whose elements are extracted
from X~ , as follows:

Matrix [ ijm] = mX  1)(  mXI , (8)
Matrix [ iju] = uX  1)(  uXI . (9)
Now that T~ is acquired, it is easy to calculate iD
~
+ iR
~
and iD
~  iR
~
, where iD
~
, iR
~
are
the sum of rows and the sum of columns of T~ , respectively.
To acquire the causal diagram, we apply the CFCS method proposed by Opricovic and
Tzeng (2003) for defuzzification. The CFCS defuzzification method has the advantages of giving a
greater crisp value with greater membership function and distinguishing two symmetrical
triangular fuzzy numbers with the same mean. The causal diagram is, then, constructed with the
horizontal axis ( iD
~
+ iR
~
)def named “Prominence” and the vertical axis ( iD
~  iR
~
)def named
“Relation”. The horizontal axis “Prominence” shows how important the criterion is, whereas the 
vertical axis “Relation” may divide the criteria into cause and efect groups. Generally, when the
value ( iD
~  iR
~
)def is positive, the criterion belongs to the cause group. If the value ( iD
~  iR
~
)def is
negative, the criterion belongs to the effect group. Hence, causal diagrams can visualize the
complicated causal relationships of criteria into a visible structural model, providing valuable
insight for problem solving. Further, with the help of a causal diagram, we may make proper
decisions by recognizing the difference between cause and effect criteria.
4. Practical case of the proposed method
The sustainable competitive advantage of a company largely depends on the ability of
research and development (R&D) that greatly affects the effectiveness and performance of
developing new products and processes. In this sense, a sound R&D investment is important for a
company’s future. However, the evaluation of R&D project is a kind of fuzzy group 
decision-making problem involved with multiple criteria (Mohanty et al., 2005). In this section,
an empirical study shows how a high-tech company applied the proposed solution to develop a
structural model for evaluating R&D projects.
The case Company H is a Taiwan firm with more than 2,350 employees in 18 countries and
turnover in excess of US$ 476 million. The company is performing as a leading solution provider
in the industrial automation market, offering more than 420 products and solutions covering the
range from system-integration hardware and software to customer-driven service. In order to cope
with challenges from newcomers and to maintain continued competitiveness in terms of shorter
lead-time, high quality, competitive prices, and improved customer service, Company H intended
to rebuild an evaluation model for R&D project selection. To that end, Company H set up a R&D
investment committee consisting of the general manager, and several managers representing the
marketing, financial, production, human resource, R&D, and information-technology
departments. To that end, Company H set up a R&D investment committee. The following shows
how Company H successfully utilized the proposed solution with the five-step procedure to
achieve its problem-solving.
Step 1: Identify the decision goal and organize a committee.
For profoundly evaluating R&D projects, Company H set up a R&D investment committee
consisting of the general manager, and several managers representing the marketing, financial,
production, human resource, R&D, and information-technology departments.
Step 2: Develop evaluation criteria and design the fuzzy linguistic scale.
First, it is necessary to gather the relevant criteria in order to create a structural model.
Through the literature review and a profound discussion, the R&D investment committee finally
adopted 11 criteria from Meade and Presley (2002), adopted the fuzzy linguistic scale (see Table
1) and 11 criteria from Meade and Presley (2002). These 11 criteria were: including: probability
of technical success (C1), existence of project champion (C2), existence of required competence

C9 3.810 0.009
C10 4.155 0.434
C11 4.281 0.465
As the causal diagram shown, the evaluation criteria were visually divided into the cause
group including C1, C3, C4, C8, and C11, while the effect group was composed of criteria C2, C5,
C6, C7, C9 and C10. From the causal diagram, valuable cues are obtained for making profound
decisions. For example, if Company H wishes to reach a high level of performance in terms of
the effect group criteria, they must first control and pay much attention to the cause group criteria.
Within the cause group, the criterion of “probability of technical success” (C1) is the most
important factor for R&D project selection, whereas the “strategic fit” (C11) has the best effect on
the other criteria. By contrast, the “net present value” (C10) is the most easily improved of the
effect group criteria. Additionally, these two cause and effect groups may be further used to
respectively serve as causal criteria and effective criteria clusters in an MCDM model such as the
AHP or ANP method (Saaty, 1990, 1996) for selecting the optimal alternative.
5. Conclusions
Decision-makers, in most practical life, hope for a causal analytical method which can
handle group decision-making problem in fuzzy environments. Hence, we have developed a
fuzzy DEMATEL method. With our proposed methodology, the interactions between criteria can
