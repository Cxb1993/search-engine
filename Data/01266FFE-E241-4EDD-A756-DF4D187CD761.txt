Yi and Nguyen[1]以二維、單相流的數值分析

子交換膜燃料電池性能之影響。研究中發現氣體
流率增加時電池的性能隨之增加，而電池的電極
厚度增加與流道肩部寬度增加時電池的性能卻隨

方向的兩種模式進行模擬，結果發現入口氣體在

擁有較高的電流密度。Kazim[4]在 1999 年，就
PEMFC 的流道幾何形狀對燃料電池效率的影響
進行探討，且選定傳統的直流狀流道和交叉型流

模擬，模擬結果顯示出隨著孔率、氧氣分壓和氧
氣莫耳分率的提高，兩種流道的功率密度也會增
加，通過交叉型流道的氧氣質傳現象則有明顯改
善，交叉型流道所得到的最大電流密度約為平行
流道最大電流密度的三倍。Gurau [5]在 1998 年
藉由 Dagen [6]的平均法則(averaging rule)，將多
孔性介質的統御方程式，由微觀方程式推導成巨
觀方程式，進而推導出 PEMFC 在不同區域下其
二維、穩態統御方程式，他將 PEMFC 分為氣體
通道、氣體擴散層、觸媒層以及質子交換膜層四
個區域。模擬時在不同區域給予不同的邊界條
件，進而模擬出各個區域的輸送現象。其結果顯
示在進入氣體擴散層後速度會驟降。因為，一旦
進入氣體擴散層之後雖然對流效果依然存在，但
主要的輸送現象則是靠擴散作用，因此在氣體擴
散層中的速度相對於氣體流道會慢很多。模擬結
果也顯示在較大的孔隙率下，限制電流（limit 
current）會比小孔隙率時大，陰極的入口速度若
是越大，則同樣的會改善氧氣的質傳效果，使得
限制電流提高。但是若其入口速度超過 0.8 m/s，
則限制電流並不會再往上提昇，這顯示在氣體流
道和氣體擴散層介面處質傳效果的影響有一定的
極限。在質子交換膜中水的輸送主要是靠壓力梯
度、電滲透力以及液態水濃度梯度等因素的加成
效果。在低電流密度時，壓力梯度的影響會大於
其他現象的影響；然而在高電流密度時，電滲透
力的影響會大於其他現象，所以水會由陽極端被
帶往到陰極端。Wang et al. [7] 於 2001 年提出二

applied in the simulations are summarized in Table 1.
Note that some minor parameters (e.g. the internal
resistance, the material properties, and so forth) are
omitted from this table, but can be found in the literature.
The operating pressure and temperature are assumed to
be 1 atm and 323 K, 333 K or 343 K, respectively.
Regarding the reactant gases, the anode is supplied with
humidified hydrogen with a mass fraction of 70/30%
H2/H2O, while the cathode is fed with saturated oxygen
with a mass fraction of 21/79 % O2/N2. The N2 gas serves
as a diluent and is assumed to be inert.
Note that for computational efficiency, the model is
divided into seven separate layers, namely the upper
wave-like channel, the anode GDL, the anode catalyst
layer (CL), the membrane, the cathode CL, the cathode
GDL and the lower wave-like channel. In general, the
heat and mass transfer characteristics of PEMFC gas flow
channels can be modeled using conventional mass
conservation, Navier-Stokes, and energy and species
conservation equations. The basic 3-D gas transport
equations for a general PEMFC can be expressed as

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
The governing equations for the current PEMFC
model have an elliptic, partial differential form.
Consequently, boundary conditions are required for all of
the boundaries in the computational domain. Due to the
conjugated nature of the modeling problem, the gas flow
channel surfaces are included within the numerical
solution domain and are treated as a fluid with particular
properties.
interface between the membrane and the cathode catalyst
layer in the outlet region of the channel. Consequently,
the liquid water saturation level in the catalyst layer is
higher than that in the GDL. Liquid water is transported
from the catalyst layer towards the GDL by capillary
action. When the liquid water reaches the interface
between the GDL and the flow channel, it is transported
toward the channel outlet by the drag force induced by
the convective flow of the gas.
Figure 5 presents the variation of the oxygen
concentration along the channel in both the wave-like and
straight gas flow channels at a cell voltage of 0.6 V and
an inlet temperature of 323 K. It can be seen that the
oxygen mole fraction decreases along the flow direction
as a result of absorption in the catalyst layer. Furthermore,
the results confirm that a greater amount of oxygen is
consumed in the wave-like channel due to the forced
convection effect.
Figures 6(a)~(c) illustrate the temperature contours
within the wave-like gas flow channel for inlet
temperatures of 323 K, 333 K and 343 K, respectively.
The results reveal that irrespective of the inlet
temperature, a relatively uniform temperature distribution
is obtained within the channel. Hence, it can be inferred
that the wave-like surface is instrumental in improving
the heat transfer within the channel. In general, the
enhanced convective heat transfer performance may be
the result of the increased flow interruption caused by the
wave-like obstacles in the channel, a reduction in the
thermal boundary layer in the region of the channel
between neighboring waves, or an increased velocity
gradient near the GDL boundary.
In this study, the validity of the numerical model was
verified by comparing the predicted results for the
polarization characteristics of the PEMFC with the
experimental data presented by Wang et al. (2003).
Figure 7 illustrates the variation of the cell voltage with
the current density for both the wave-like channel and the
straight channel. Note that the anode and cathode
channels both have an inlet temperature of 323 K. It is
clear that a good agreement exists between the numerical
results for the straight gas flow channel and the
experimental data, and hence the validity of the
computational model is confirmed.
Figure 8 compares the polarization curves of the
wave-like channel and the straight channel at inlet
temperatures of 323K, 333 K and 343K, respectively. It is
observed that a good agreement exists between the two
sets of results at low to medium current densities.
However, at high current densities, the wave-like channel
yields an effective increase in both the cell voltage and
the power density. The relatively poorer performance of
the straight gas flow channel in the high current density
region is most reasonably attributed to the lower velocity
of the gas fuel supply to the GDL and catalyst layers.
From a close inspection, it can be seen that both the cell
voltage and the power density increase slightly as the fuel
cell temperature increases. An improved PEMFC
performance is obtained because a higher temperature
results in a greater catalytic activity and a greater capacity
for water removal via evaporation. In other words,
increasing the temperature reduces the level of flooding
within the fuel cell. Moreover, a higher cell temperature
increases the membrane conductivity and mass diffusivity,
and therefore reduces the mass transport resistance.
However, as the flow distance increases, the temperature
distribution within the wave-like channel remains
relatively uniform, while that within the straight channel
falls rapidly. The relatively higher temperature within the
wave-like channel enhances the membrane conductivity
and accelerates the electrode kinetics. As a result, the
electrical performance of the PEMFC is improved
CONCLUSIONS
This study has utilized a 3-D computational model to
compare the fluid flow phenomena within PEMFCs
containing a conventional straight gas flow channel or a
novel wave-like gas flow channel. The simulations have
considered inlet temperatures of 323 K, 333K and 343 K,
respectively, and have focused specifically on the
influence of the forced convection effect induced in the
wave-like channel on the gas flow characteristics,
temperature distribution, electrochemical reaction
efficiency and electrical performance of the PEMFC. In
general, the results have shown that compared to a
straight gas flow channel, the wave-like channel provides
an improved convective heat transfer performance, a
higher gas flow velocity and a more uniform temperature
distribution. As a result, the efficiency of the catalytic
reaction is greatly enhanced. The improved catalytic
reaction results in a higher cell voltage and an improved
power density, particularly at higher values of the inlet
temperature and current density.

The bipolar plate is a multi-functional component of the 
PEMFC. Its primary roles include delivering the reactant gases 
to the fuel cell electrodes, providing an electrical connection 
between adjacent cells in the stack, removing the water by-
product from the cell, and dissipating the reaction heat. A 
bipolar plate must meet the following material and construction 
requirements [7-8]: 
1、high electrical conductivity (DOE target > 100 S/cm );  
2、high thermal conductivity (PlugPower’s target > 10 W/mK);  
3、good mechanical properties (PlugPower’s target targets: 
tensile strength > 41 MPa, flexural strength > 59 MPa, impact 
strength > 40.5 J/m; DOE target: crush strength > 4200 kPa);  
4、thermal stability at fuel cell operating temperature (-40 to 
120℃ for fuel cell driven vehicles);  
5、chemical stability in the presence of fuel, oxidant and 
product water, which may be slightly acidic (DOE target: 
corrosion < 16 2/ cmAμ )  
The high cost of the graphite-based bipolar plates used in 
many PEMFCs is the result of the brittleness of the graphite, 
which increases the machining costs of the flow channels on 
the plates. Accordingly, extensive research has been conducted 
to identify low cost, high performance alternatives to graphite. 
Various candidate materials have been proposed, including 
metal-based bipolar plates [9-11], carbon-filled polymers [12], 
and carbon/carbon composites [13]. Accordingly, Nylon-6 is 
chosen as the polymer matrix in the present study and is 
blended with S316L stainless steel fibers to create a composite 
material with which to fabricate the current bipolar plates.  
For materials with high carbon concentrations, injection 
molding enables the mass-production of low-cost bipolar plates 
[14]. Furthermore, injection molding and compression molding 
are also suitable for the fabrication of bipolar plates using 
carbon-filled polypropylene (PP) and polyphenylene sulfide 
(PPS). Accordingly, injection molding provides a convenient 
technique for fabricating the current Nylon-6 / S316L stainless 
steel bipolar plates.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL  
As discussed above, the current bipolar plates are fabricated 
using a composite material comprising Nylon-6 polymer 
thermoplastic and S316L stainless steel alloy fibers. Although 
Nylon-6 is a non-conductor, the addition of the S316L stainless 
steel fibers ensures that the bipolar plates have good electronic 
conductivity and excellent corrosion resistance. Furthermore, 
Nylon-6 is known to form homogeneous mixtures when 
combined with suitable resins. Generally, the electrical 
properties and mechanical stability of bipolar plates are 
improved with an increased stainless steel alloy fiber content. 
Therefore, the present study specifies a basic composition for 
the bipolar plates of 40 wt.% Nylon-6 polymeric composite 
with adhesive and 60 wt.% stainless steel alloy fiber (See Table 
2). Using an injection molding process, bipolar plates were 
fabricated with a total thickness of 3.5 mm and an active area of 
25 cm2.  
A membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) was then 
fabricated by placing electrodes on either side of a pre-treated 
Nafion 112 (50 mμ ) membrane (ElectroChem), with platinum 
loadings of 0.2 and 0.4 mg/cm2 for the anode and cathode, 
respectively. A fuel cell was then constructed using the 
prepared MEA, a Teflon gasket, and two Nylon-6 flow-field 
plates positioned on either side of the MEA (see Figure 1).  
In the first step, the suitability of S316L stainless steel alloy 
as the main component of the bipolar plate composite material 
was appraised. Through mechanical and electrical testing, it 
was established that the optimal fiber length was 6.4 mm 
(0.25in). Having chosen S316L and Nylon-6 as the materials 
for the bipolar plates, electrical conductivity tests and SEM 
(Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis were performed to 
establish a suitable mix of the two components. Subsequently, 
the bipolar plate flow fields and the injection molds were 
designed and fabricated. Using the Nylon-6 / S316L composite 
material, bipolar plates with an interdigitated type flow field 
were fabricated via injection molding under the processing 
conditions shown in Table 3. The bulk resistance of the plates 
was measured using a four-point probe (4PP) method with a 
280CI probe purchased from SE Technologies Co. The quality 
of the injection-molded plates (in terms of the distribution and 
direction of the stainless steel alloy fibers within the composite 
material) was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. 
The resistance, Voltage-Current (V-I), Power density-Current 
(P-I), and Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) characteristics of the 
PEMFC incorporating the composite bipolar plates were then 
evaluated and compared to the results obtained from a PEMFC 
constructed using conventional graphite bipolar plates.  
The Voltage-Current (V-I), Power density-Current (P-I) and 
Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) characteristics of the fabricated 
PEMFC were obtained using a Bean 300M digital multimeter 
(Bean Co., Taiwan) linked to an IBM PC. Meanwhile, the 
quality of the injection molded composite bipolar plates was 
evaluated from sectional SEM photographs of the electrolyte-
membrane acquired using a JSM-5610 SEM (JEOL).  
It has been reported that thermoplastic with low additive 
loadings of 50 wt. % achieve specific bulk conductivities of 
approximately 50 S/cm [15]. Standard composite materials 
consist of a thermoplastic polymer matrix and a carbon 
compound mixture with additional additives to increase the 
electrical conductivity of the compound material. This study 
improves the electrical conductivity of the composite mixture 
by using stainless steel fibers in place of carbon compound 
additives.  
To evaluate the performance of the fabricated PEMFC, 
humidified hydrogen and oxygen were supplied to the anode 
and cathode, respectively. The PEMFC was tested under room 
temperature conditions (25 CD ~ 30 CD ). The humidity of the 
pure hydrogen (99.999 % H2; 200 sccm) supplied to the anode 
was varied from 10 to 100 % during the open circuit voltage 
(OCV) measurement test, and maintained at 100 % for all other 
tests. Meanwhile, humidified oxygen gas (200 sccm) was 
supplied to the cathode side throughout all of the measurement 
operations.  
To evaluate the performance of the current PEMFC, the V-I 
and P-I characteristics of the cell were measured and compared 
to those of the conventional graphite-based bipolar plate fuel 
cell. The measured resistance includes contributions from the 
bulk material and from the contact resistance between the 
diffusion media and the plates. Note that the influence of lead 
resistances and other parasitic resistances can be neglected 
because the four-wire-system used for measurement purposes 
in this study eliminates these resistances by comparing the 
 4  
test. The properties are consistent with the targets specified for 
conventional PEMFCs.  
The Nylon-6 / stainless steel alloy fiber composite compound 
has a high electrical conductivity (60 S/cm). However, 
increasing the stainless steel alloy fiber content causes the 
composite to become stiff. Hence, fabricating the bipolar plates 
using an injection molding process is difficult. Improving the 
electrical conductivity of the bipolar plates, whilst 
simultaneously developing the means for their precision mass 
fabrication is an important area of future research. Furthermore, 
with an operating voltage of 0.6 V (the general operating 
voltage for a PEMFC), the current PEMFC provides a current 
density of 350 mA/cm2 (see Figure 6) and a low power density 
of 210 mW/cm2. Therefore, improving the current density is 
also an important topic for further research.  
 
CONCLUSIONS 
This study has used a Nylon-6 / S316L stainless steel alloy 
fiber composite material to mold conductive plastic bipolar 
plates for a PEM fuel cell. The resulting bipolar plates are 
inexpensive, have favorable corrosive, hardness, and gas 
tightness properties, are lightweight and small, and are easy to 
manufacture. Although the performance of the current PEMFC 
fails to match that of conventional PEMFCs with graphite 
bipolar plates, the present results have suggested that, with 
further improvement, the current Nylon-6 / S316L stainless 
steel composite material may provide a feasible alternative to 
graphite for the bipolar plates in PEMFCs. Despite the 
relatively poorer performance of the current PEMFC in its 
present state of development compared to the conventional 
graphite-based PEMFC, the Nylon-6 / S316L stainless steel 
composite material has a lower cost than graphite, while the use 
of injection molding provides the potential for rapid, low-cost 
mass production. Therefore, the current bipolar plates have 
commercial potential and merit further investigation and 
improvement. 
Accordingly, in future studies, the current authors intend to 
enhance the performance of the developed PEMFC by 
improving its water draining characteristics. Specifically, the 
authors intend to investigate the effect of the fuel cell 
orientation (e.g. 0-, 45-, and 90-degree orientations) on the 
water draining performance, and to enhance the molding 
process such that the smoothness of the flow channels is 
improved. Furthermore, attempts will be made to reduce the 
contact resistance by increasing the S316L fiber length and 
coating Ni and Ti alloys on the fiber surface. Finally, polymer 
research will be performed to reduce the holes in the matrix 
following injection molding and to improve the surface 
hydrophobic effect of the composite material.
