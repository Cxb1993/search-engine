III. 文獻探討  Background 
A Articular Cartilage   
Articular cartilage is a white, dense connective tissue which covers the bony articulating ends inside the joint.  
It consists of two phases, a solid organic matrix (50% mass by dry weight collagen fibrils and 20-30% mass 
by dry weight proteoglycan macromolecules) [5-8] and a mobile interstitial fluid phase (mostly water) [9, 10].  
Aggregates of proteoglycans are important in the development and maintenance of cartilage.  Because of its 
polyanionic glycosaminoglycan chains, the proteoglycan draws water into the tissue resulting in a large 
osmotic pressure which is constricted by the collagen network [11].  The balance between the osmotic 
swelling pressure of the proteoglycans and the tension in the collagen fibers [12] results in a highly 
specialized connective tissue that is well suited for bearing compressive load.  Thus, the biomechanical 
properties of articular cartilage are dependent on the integrity of the collagen network and on maintenance of 
a high proteoglycan content within the matrix.  Chondrocytes comprise less than 10% of the tissue volume  
and maintain this matrix [13]. 
The clinical need for improved treatment options for patients with cartilage injuries has motivated tissue 
engineering studies aimed at the in vitro generation of cell-based replacement tissues (or implants) with 
functional properties.  Various hydrogels have been utilized for cartilage tissue engineering, including 
calcium alginate [14], fibrin gels [15], type I collagen gel [16], type II collagen gel [17], photopolymerizing 
gels [18] and more recently self-assembled protein hydrogels [19].  Presently, only agarose has been shown 
to generate in vitro functional tissue grafts [1].  Agarose is a clear, thermoreversible hydrogel made of 
polysaccharides that has been used extensively in for maintaining long-term chondrocyte suspension cultures.   
B Silk Hydrogel  
Silk is a natural protein, most often isolated from cocoons of a silkworm, Bombyx mori, that has been 
traditionally used as sutures [20, 21].  Similar to collagen, silk fibroin is consisted of highly repetitive 
primary sequence that leads to significant homogeneity in secondary structure, i.e. -sheets [22].  Silk 
processing and self-assembly provide the basis for the formation of a range of scaffolds, including hydrogels, 
films, conformal coatings, porous matrices, nanoscale fibers, and large fibers [23].  Long-term studies using 
silk as a suture material as well as substrate have found good biocompatibility and degradation properties [24].  
While it is not water-soluble in vitro, proteases that are ubiquitous in vivo degrade silk from days to years, 
depending on the formulation [21, 25].  Recently, Dr. Kaplan’s lab developed a novel method using 
sonication energy to promote silk fibroin gelation within 30 min, at ambient temperature and neutral pH, and 
was shown to support cartilage formation ([26]).  
C Effects of Substrate Stiffness  
Cells in their native environment reside in a social context where they interact with other cells and the 
extracellular matrix (ECM).  The majority of metazoan cells require attachment to a solid substrate to 
survive.  A phenomenon called anchorage dependence.  With a variety of matrix proteins, the ECM 
provides a mechanical, biochemical, and topographical environment.  In the bone marrow cavity, the ECM is 
believed to provide a stem cell ‘niche’ where the mechanical and topographical features present a 3D physical 
environment that combines with biochemistry to direct stem cell fate [27].  In addition to cells passively 
sensing their microenvironment, they can also actively respond according to the environmental cues.  Cell 
attachment to the substrate initiates a series of events, including the previously mentioned focal adhesion 
complex formation and cytoskeleton organization.  In conjunction with mitogens, the cellular structural

characterize cell responses to substrate thickness/stiffness [36].

V. 計畫成果 
While the original proposal was for 2 years, in the significantly reduced budget and allotted time (one year), 
we have achieved more than half of the proposed goals.  We aimed, in the first phase of the project, to 
establish a microfabricated platform for generating substrates with different mechanical properties but 
identical chemical compositions.  Section A illustrates the design of such platform.  However, an 
unexpected result was found when silk hydrogel was used instead of collagen.  Very thin gels of silk were 
opaque, thus preventing real-time observation of cell morphology, and had poor adhesion to the PDMS 
substrate, thus preventing control of construct properties.  To mitigate these issues, we adapted collagen as 
the hydrogel material and the results are described in Section A  We also enhanced this platform with simpler 
fabrication by changing only the hydrogel thickness, rather than using multiple posts, which has the 
disadvantage of heterogeneous mechanics.  We generated substrates with stiffness gradients by incorporating 
a step in the substrate, thus creating different thickness of the hydrogel.  AFM measurements confirmed that 
by varying hydrogel thickness, we can modulate the effective stiffness at the surface of the hydrogel.  And 
indeed, cells can sense the changes in substrate thickness/stiffness and exhibit durotaxis on such platform 
(Figure IV-3B).   
Furthermore, to test our original hypothesis and control silk hydrogel properties for cartilage tissue 
engineering, we consulted our collaborator, Dr. David Kaplan from Tufts University, and adapted silk fibers as 
a means of reinforcement.  Silk fibers indeed allowed us to manipulate the mechanical properties of the 
hydrogel (Figure IV-4A).  When chondrocytes were encapsulated in the fiber reinforced hydrogel, they 
expressed more phenotypic extracellular matrices and developed tissues with more physiologic functionalities 
(Figure IV-4B).  These findings supported our hypothesis that optimal cartilage tissue development requires 
appropriate scaffold mechanical integrity.  Future studies will further investigate the mechanisms behind the 
silk fiber and silk hydrogel interactions and understand the influence of scaffold mechanical properties on cell 
mechanotransduction and cartilage development.  Results of these researches were presented at the 
prestigious 2012 annual Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) Meeting in San Francisco, CA, on February 4
th
, 
2012.  ORS is the premiere conference for orthopaedics related research with low abstract acceptance rates.  
The proceeding is appended.  We are also in the process of preparing manuscripts for full-length article 
submissions.  In addition to the ongoing manuscript preparations, we have obtained further funding based on 
these results from the NSC to further examine the effects of 3D matrix structure and stiffness on single cell 
behaviors (NSC101-2221-E-002-045 -MY2).

INTRODUCTION 
The microenvironment has a significant impact on cell phenotypic 
expression and behaviors.  One aspect of the microenvironment is the 
mechanical properties, which modulates cell migration, cytoskeleton 
structures, gene expression, and differentiation [1].  More recently, 
substrate thickness has been shown to change cell spreading area and 
traction forces [2-3].  In addition to changes in depth, effective modulus 
of the substrate also changes, with thinner gels approximating stiffer gels 
[4].  We developed a microfluidic system to precisely vary collagen gel 
thickness and examine its effect on directed ligament fibroblast 
migration.  Furthermore, as cells reside in a highly organized 
environment in situ, the fibers of the collagen gel are aligned to 
investigate the effects of contact guidance on cell migration. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE 
Electric field (EF)-induced migration is fundamental in development and 
wound healing [5-6].  Findings from this study can enhance our 
understanding of morphogenesis and provide optimized treatment 
strategies. 
 
METHODS AND MATERIALS 
Cell Culture  Anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs) are harvested from 
young porcine knee joints and cut into cubes.  The fibroblasts were 
released from the ligament explants via enzymatic digestion and cultured 
in DMEM with 10% FBS (Invitrogen).   
3D Cell Culture  Collagen solution (rat tail type I, BD) was neutralized 
per manufacture’s protocol to reach a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml.  
The collagen solutions were incubated at 4oC for 90 minutes and mixed 
with cells before injecting into a custom microchannel to promote 
laminar shear flow [7].  Thick gels were generated by repeating the 
casting procedure to create a double-layered gel where the first layer was 
cell free.  Collagen organization was visualized with reflectance 
confocal microscopy [8].   
Electric Field  The cells were subjected to an applied direct current EF in 
a modified electrical stimulation chamber and observed with an inverted 
microscope [9].  The EFs were applied at a field strength of 6 V/cm 
parallel to the fiber direction.  Images were taken every 15 minutes for 1 
hour.  For groups treated with the rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) 
inhibitor Y27632 (10 µM, Caymen), experiments were conducted 
without the inhibitor.   
Fluorescence Imaging  Upon completion of the EF, samples were fixed 
in paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-α-tubulin (Sigma DM1A) and 
phalloidin (Invitrogen).  Images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP2 
confocal microscopy system.  
Image Analysis  Cell displacement and angle (θ) along the EF axis were 
measured.  Directional velocity, a representation of cell migration in the 
direction of the field, was calculated by multiplying migration speed 
with cos(θ).  Co-localization of actin and tubulin was performed by 
analyzing the images with intensity correlation [10].  All analyses were 
done in Image J.   
Statistical Analysis  Statistica (StatSoft) was used to perform ANOVA 
with LSD post-hoc tests (α=0.05). 
 
RESULTS 
3D cultures of ACL fibroblasts were generated in collagen gels where 
after two days of culture, cells aligned to the fiber direction (Figure 1).  
Applied EF enhanced ACL fibroblast migration speed in both thin and 
thick gels.  However, cell migration was in the opposite direction 
(Figure 2).  ROCK inhibitor Y27632 slightly inhibited EF-induced 
migration speed but reversed migration direction in the thick gels.   
Examination of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons revealed an 
interaction between gel thickness and applied EF, which was further 
modulated when ROCK activity was inhibited (Figure 3). 
 
DISCUSSION 
EF-induced cell directionality is modulated via the rho family of 
GTPases [11].  Rho is also involved in regulating cell attachment and 
cytoskeleton organization in response to different substrate stiffness [12].  
In cell migration, the tensional balance achieved by forward and 
backward forces determines cell migration speed and directionality [13].  
In the current study, substrate thickness, and the resulting effective 
stiffness, modulates EF-induced directional migration in 3D. 
Interestingly, the same phenomenon was not found in 2D studies (data 
not shown).  Furthermore, we found different actin-microtubule 
interactions in the two substrates, which were influenced by the ROCK 
inhibitor (Figure 3).  While less understood than the individual filament 
systems, interactions between actin and microtubule is fundamental for 
cell polarization [14].  Future studies will investigate the signaling 
mechanisms of mechanosensing and actin-microtubule interactions.

Cell-type Specific Migration Response to Substrate Thickness/Stiffness Gradient 
Shen, S C; Chang, W R; +Chao, P H G

INTRODUCTION   
Cell phenotype can be characterized in terms of morphology, gene 
expression, and behavior.  In an effort to promote stem cell 
differentiation, it is crucial to understand the fundamental differences in 
cell phenotype.  While traditionally, cell morphology and gene 
expression are monitored for phenotypic variations, cellular responses to 
physical stimulation is also a manifestation of lineage specification [1].  
For example, aortic endothelial cells are known to align perpendicular to 
the applied stress while cardiomyocytes align parallel [2-3].  In both cell 
types, interestingly, the reorganization are mediated via the same 
Rac/Rho signaling pathway, suggesting that in addition to the 
transduction process, differential phenotypic regulation of the cell types 
can influence the resulting cell behavior.  In the current study, 
undifferentiated human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) and primary porcine anterior cruciate ligament fibroblasts 
(ACLFs) were compared in terms of their cell size and migration 
behavior on substrates with a stiffness/thickness gradient.   
 
SIGNIFICANCE   
Recent reports described the ‘depth-sensing’ ability of cells on soft 
hydrogels where cell behaviors on thin gels are more similar to those on 
stiffer substrates [4-5].  The current study takes advantage of this 
phenomenon and provides a new way to promote cell migration and 
characterize phenotypic behaviors.  Studying physical regulation of cell 
phenotype is important in designing biomaterials and understanding 
development and disease progression [1]. 
 
METHODS AND MATERIALS 
Composite substrate  The composite substrate is composed of collagen 
gel and silicon elastomer, PDMS (Figure 1).  The PDMS structures were 
fabricated by soft lithography.  For migration studies, the step 
microstructure was 60 µm high.  In long-term studies, the microposts 
were 60 µm high and 300 µm in diameter.  Collagen gel (rat tail type I, 
BD, 3 mg/ml) was bound to the PDMS microstructure via plasma 
treatment and incubated overnight, resulting in a total gel thickness of 
400 µm.    In control substrates, collagen gels were bound to smooth 
PDMS substrates to generate uniform thickness (340 and 400 µm). The 
effective modulus of collagen gel was measured with atomic force 
microscope (Asylum Research).  Force-distance curves were analyzed 
according to Hertz model, with a Poisson’s ratio of 0.33.  
Cell culture  ACLFs were isolated from porcine anterior cruciate 
ligaments via explant cultures.  MSCs were provided by Dr. Shih-Chieh 
Hung at National Yang-Ming University [6].  Cells were cultured in 
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), buffers, and 
antibiotics. Prior to experiments, cells were released from culture dishes 
and seeded at 20,000 cell/cm2 for ACLF and 2,000 cell/cm2 for MSCs, 
due to the different cell sizes and proliferation rates. 
Cell Behavior Measurements  For migration studies, heated cultures 
were placed on an inverted microscope and images were acquired every 
15 minutes for 2 hours.  Cell displacement was measured to obtain 
migration speed.  Long term cell migration behavior was monitored 
every 24 hours for 3 days. Cell area was measured by manually tracing 
the cells.  Analyses were done using Image J (NIH). Cell density was 
determined from the cell count in images and normalized to surface area. 
Statistical Analysis  Statistica (StatSoft) was used to perform ANOVA 
with post-hoc tests (Fisher’s LSD, α=0.05) 
 
RESULTS   
ACLF and MSCs exhibited different cell size change on the substrates of 
different thickness (Figure 2).  AFM testing found a significantly smaller 
effective modulus in the thick region of the composite substrate (thin: 
6.54 ±0.46 kPa, thick: 2.61±0.50 kPa).  Short term analysis of cell 
migration speed revealed that MSCs migrated at a significantly faster 
rate on the thickness gradient (ACLF:5.37 ± 4.08, MSC: 17.09 ±
14.12 µm/hr, n=29-97, p<0.0001).  After 3 days in culture, ACLFs 
exhibited significantly different cell sizes on various substrates while 
MSC size was not affected (Figure 3).   There is significantly higher cell 
density in the composite thin region (on top of the microposts), while 
there is more or similar cell density on the control thin and thick groups, 
suggesting an inward migration toward the center of posts on the 
composite substrate (Figure 3).

vs all others, **p<0.03 vs designated groups, 40 cells per group were 
analyzed for cell size and 12-29 regions were analyzed for cell density). 
 
DISCUSSION   
In analyzing cell response to substrate thickness, many studies examine 
cell spreading areas [5, 7].  Interestingly, while no change in cell size 
was found with MSCs in our system, we still find directed migration 
toward the thin region (Figure 3).  When compared with differentiated 
ACLFs, MSC migrated faster on the same substrates, which may be 
attributed to the significantly larger cell size (Figure 3).  The faster 
migration rate results in higher MSC concentration rate (ratio of cell 
density on the composite substrate) on the microposts (3.2 versus 1.7).  
Our result suggests that in addition to spreading area, additional metrics 
are needed to better characterize cell responses to substrate 
thickness/stiffness [7-8].

ABSTRACT: Guided cell migration is important in tissue development, repair, and engineering. We have previously demonstrated that
applied electric fields (EFs) enhanced and directed ligament fibroblast migration and collagen production, depending on EF parameters.
Electrical stimulation is widely used for the treatment of pain and to promote wound healing. In orthopaedic practices, applied EFs
promote bone healing and ligament repair in vivo. In the current study, stimulation waveforms used in physical therapy for promoting
tissue repair were adapted to examine their effects on ACL fibroblast migration. Using different waveform and field strengths, we
discovered a decoupling of cell motility and directionality, which suggests disparate mechanisms. Integrin, a major extracellular matrix
receptor, polarized in response to applied EFs and controlled cell directionality and signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that
RhoA is a mediator between integrin aggregation and directed cell migration. Polarization is essential in directed cell migration
and our study establishes an outside-in signaling mechanism for EF-induced cell directionality.  2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Endogenous electric signal is often created when a
breached epithelium at wound site generates an elec-
trical shunt that results in ion flow.1 The resulting
electrical cue promotes wound healing by enhancing
cell migration, proliferation, coordinated cell polariza-
tion, angiogenesis and directed nerve regeneration.2–4
Endogenous electric signals also play an important
role in embryonic morphogenesis, where electric field
(EF) arises from polarized ion transport activities
and directs events such as left–right asymmetry and
differentiation.5,6
EF directed cell migration, known as galvanotaxis
or electrotaxis, has been described in many cell types,
including corneal epithelial cells, embryonic neurons,
and ligament fibroblasts.2,7 In animal studies, applied
EFs promote lapine knee ligament healing.8,9 As the
low frequency EFs are not likely to penetrate the cell
membrane due to its high impedance, galvanotaxis is
believed to result from activated membrane channels
and reorganization of charged surface molecules via
electrophoretic and electroosmotic forces.10,11 Interest-
ingly, while early studies showed that concanavalin A
receptors and calcium signaling polarize to mediate
EF-induced directionality in embryonic muscle cells,
more recent experiments indicated that neither cell
surface charges nor calcium signaling determine the
direction of galvanotaxis in fibroblasts.10,12,13 This
leads to a continued search for possible mechanisms.
Most studies in EF-induced migration utilized
direct current (DC) EFs, though electrical stimulation
in a variety of waveforms are used clinically to pro-
mote wound healing and reduce pain in physical
therapy and orthopaedics.14,15 In the current study,
we examine some of the most widely used waveforms
on their effects on ligament fibroblast migration.16 In-
terestingly, we find disparate effects in migration
speed and directionality from these stimuli, thus a
decoupling of cell motility and polarization responses.
We further investigate the mechanisms behind cell
polarization. a2b1 integrin, an extracellular matrix
receptor for collagen and fibronectin, has been
reported to be required for cell migration and polariza-
tion.17 EF polarized integrin distribution and activa-
tion, which leads to intracellular RhoA colocalization
and directional cell migration. RhoA is known to regu-
late membrane protrusion at the leading edge and lo-
calized RhoA activation is an important mediator of
cell polarization.18 Our results demonstrate a novel
link for EF-induced outside-in signaling and cell
polarization.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Cell Culture
Anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs) were harvested from young
porcine knees and diced. The explants were cultured in DMEM
(Biowest, Nuaille´, France) supplemented with antibiotics and
10% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) until the outgrowth
became confluent. Cells were plated at 1.8  104 cells/cm2 on
glass slides for 2 h prior to experiments.
Electrical Stimulation
A customized electrical stimulation chamber was used to apply
EFs as previously described.19 The chamber provided a uniform
EF across the cells and was connected to the power supply via a
pair of agarose salt bridges, saline reservoirs and Ag-AgCl elec-
trodes. Constant DC EFs were applied at 30 or 0.19 V across
the chamber (resulting in a field strength of 6 or 0.03 V/cm)
using a DC power supply (Keithley, Cleveland, OH). Other
waveforms, illustrated in Figure 1, were applied using a

groups with significant cathodal directed migration
(6 V, faradic and diadynamic) also had significant
cathodal aggregation of integrin and the sine group
with anodal directed migration had anodal integrin ag-
gregation. Directionality correlated significantly with
the asymmetry index, with a correlation coefficient of
0.876 (p ¼ 0.009, S-Figure 1C). To understand the role
of a2b1 integrin in EF-induced cell directionality, we
examined integrin distribution with respect to time
after the onset of DC EF at 6 V/cm. Figure 4A illus-
trates that integrin polarization can be detected as
early as 5 min and equilibrates after 10 min. We also
investigated the response in the context of an integrin
functional blocking antibody.23 Integrin inhibition
significantly reduced cell directionality and motility
(Fig. 4B).
A number of studies have demonstrated the interac-
tions between integrin activation and RhoA signaling,
which is involved in cell polarization and migra-
tion.20,24–27 Using an antibody against RhoA, a similar
trend of RhoA distribution was found with integrin,
where RhoA is more concentrated near the leading
edge of the cell (Fig. 5A). Analysis of the asymmetry
index for RhoA distribution also revealed the same
trend of EF-induced polarization as integrin distribu-
tion (Fig. 5B). A similar phenomenon was observed
with active RhoA (Fig. 5C). When a2b1 integrin was
functionally blocked, however, applied EF had no
effect on active RhoA distribution. To further under-
stand the role of RhoA in directional migration, ACL
fibroblasts were treated with the cell-permeable C3
transferase, a potent and specific RhoA inhibitor.28 C3
treatment did not reduce EF-induced cell motility, yet
it significantly suppressed EF-induced directionality
(Fig. 6). C3 treatment also attenuated EF-induced
integrin polarization, suggesting that integrin polari-
zation may involve both outside-in and inside-out sig-
naling mechanisms (Fig. 6C).
DISCUSSION
Cell migration plays an important role in wound heal-
ing. Electric fields have been shown to promote wound

specifically binds to the main ligament matrix compo-
nent, type I collagen, and a2 integrin has been shown
to modulate ligament fibroblast migration and mecha-
notransduction.37,38 Similar to previous reports, we
found integrin polarization toward the migration direc-
tion, regardless of motility (Fig. 3). By functionally
blocking a2b1 integrin with its antibody, migration
directionality was significantly attenuated while the
cells remained motile in EF (Fig. 4). This finding is in
contrast with a previous report by Huang and cow-
orkers where inhibition of integrin by functional block-
ing antibody suppressed keratinocyte motility.34
However, in another study using truncated b4 integrin
cytoplasmic tail, Pullar et al.32 found no inhibition of
motility in the presence of EGF. The disparity of these
reports may arise from the involvement of other ECM
receptors such as other integrins in the different cell
types and systems, as well as alterations in attach-
ment strength.39
The integrin polarization response to applied EF
coincides with RhoA polarization (Fig. 5). Functional
blocking of integrin activation results in random RhoA
distribution and inhibition of RhoA reduces EF-
induced integrin polarization and abolishes cell migra-
tion directionality (Figs. 5 and 6). These results
suggest that EF-induced integrin aggregation and acti-
vation recruit and activate RhoA for directed migra-
tion, while RhoA may also generate a feedback
mechanism to enhance integrin aggregation. The in-
creased motility with RhoA attenuation also suggests
modulated cell tension and adhesion. While most
descriptions of RhoA distribution during cell migration
locate it near the trailing edge of the cells, some stud-
ies report RhoA activation in the leading edge.18 Src-
dependent RhoA-activated kinase (ROCK) phosphory-
lation has recently been reported to attenuate RhoA
signaling at the leading edge of migration, where Src
is preferentially activated in response to EF.40,41 Addi-
tionally, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) has been
shown to attenuate EF-induced directional migra-
tion.42 PKA is a likely candidate in integrin-mediated
RhoA activation.43,44 Future studies will investigate
the mechanisms behind integrin and RhoA activation,
and the related signaling molecules. In the current
study, we demonstrate that integrin redistributes as
early as 5 min to applied EF and its clustering and
activation lead to intracellular RhoA polarization and
signaling to dictate cell migration directionality.
Better understanding of the EF-induced mechanisms
can help in optimizing therapy parameters as well as
provide new insights into tissue morphogenesis and
wound healing.

一、 國際合作研究過程 
本次與美國紐約哥倫比亞大學的 Dr. Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic 合作，研究基材軟硬度對軟骨組織
生長之影響。期間共出國兩次至紐約拜訪 Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic 的實驗室，並進行材料交流、實
驗、及會議。由於原提案之絲水膠與矽膠的三維複合結構執行上遭到瓶頸，故此次計畫改由兩方
向進行。第一是變更矽膠的三維複合結構設計以更容易製作，並改用膠原蛋白水膠以增加複合結
構的透光性與接合度。此外採納塔夫茲大學 Dr. David Kaplan 的建議 ( Tufts University ， Dr. 
Kaplan 是國際上絲蛋白的專家，也於本次計畫中提供絲蛋白原料 ) ，並與 Dr. Vunjak-Novakovic 
的學生合作，於絲水膠中添加絲纖維，以也是複合材料的方式來改變絲水膠基質的軟硬度。研究
結果指出，這樣的方式果然有效的促進軟骨組織的生長。此外，出國期間並參與  Dr. 
Vunjak-Novakovic 與 Dr. Kaplan 主持之組織工程研究中心 ( Tissue Engineering Research Center, 
TERC ) 之例行會議，並至西奈山醫學院進行演講與交流，講題為 ’Ligament Fibroblast Migration 
and Polarization in Electric Fields and the Influence of Microenvironment’，以及參訪其骨科部之骨科研
究實驗室。 
 
二、 研究成果 
如上所述，此次計畫改由兩方向進行。第一是變更矽膠的三維複合結構設計，並改用膠原蛋白水
膠以增加複合結構的透光性與接合度。這方向的研究證實了結構設計的假說，也就是可以利用雙
層的複合型結構來改變表面的機械性質，並藉以控制細胞行為。此成果已於今年二月在舊金山舉
行的 2012 Annual Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) Meeting 以海報的形式發表，此外相關研究的
成果也已投稿於生物材料領域的 Acta Biomaterialia 期刊，目前正在接受 revision 的審核。另一方
面，我們利用絲水膠中添加絲纖維的複合材料來改變絲水膠基質的軟硬度，並於中培養軟骨細胞
以觀測基材軟硬度對軟骨組織生長之影響，此研究結果也符合原提計畫之假說第二部分，也就是
