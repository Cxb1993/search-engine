where n is the number of group types deﬁned in Table 2; vi, the
number from group i in a molecule; fi (i=1,. . .n), the group contri-
bution for the ith deﬁned group; and f0, the intersect of the ﬁtting
line. For a more accurate estimation, other nonlinear models could
be adopted as the empirical model. In the literature, the nonlinear
form of Eq. (2) has been announced to be the most suitable form
for predicting AITs [15,16].

(2)
However, such a claim is debatable. First, the parameter b′ in Eq.
(2) is a redundant parameter. It is obvious that the following Eq.
(3) has the same ﬁtting and predictive abilities as Eq. (2), but the
number of unknown parameters in Eq. (3) is one less than that in
Eq. (2). It is well known that solving a nonlinear regression prob-
lem is usually time-consuming and can easily get bogged down at
local solutions; and a redundant parameter will aggravate these
two problems. Second, it is obvious that Eq. (3) can be reasonably
taken as a modiﬁed form from the conventional MLR model. So,
the terms corresponding to parameters b, c, and d in Eq. (3) could
be considered as the correcting terms for the MLR model, and the
results of the MLR model could be then taken as the start point
(i.e., all fi’s and a are taken from the MLR, and the others are set to
be zero) to solve the nonlinear regression problem of Eq. (3). For
a given iterative algorithm, a good start point always decreases its
possibility of being bogged at local solutions and enhance its efﬁ-
ciency, thus Eq. (3) is superior to Eq. (2) for building amodel in this
respect.

To demonstrate the superiority of Eq. (3), data listed in Table A1
are used to build the models of Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. Then,
data listed in Table A2 are used to compare their predictive capabil-
ity. The SGC groups’ deﬁnitions listed in Table 2 and the linearized

an empirical model, there is an increased chance for the estimation
process to draw noises and other spurious phenomena from the
training data into the resulting model, which always decreases the
predictive capability of the resulting model.
The sum of squared errors is the usual index to evaluate the
feasibility of a given model. In this study, the quantitative measure
of goodness of ﬁt is given by the explained variation in the training
set (R2), whereas the predictive capability, on the other hand, is
given by the predicted variation in the validation set (Q2). These
two indices are deﬁned as follows.
R2 = 1 −

, for the training set
Q2 = 1 −
∑K
i=1(yi − yˆ)
2∑K
i=1(yi − y¯)
2
, for the validation set
where yi is the ith sample measurement; yˆi, the predicted value of
the ith sample; y¯, the average of all samplemeasurements. Usually,
the R2 and Q2 vary differently with increasing model complex-
ity (i.e., number of parameters in a model). R2 is inﬂationary and
approachesunity as themodel complexity increases.Hence, it is not
sufﬁcient to only have a high R2 for a practicalmodel. The goodness
of predictive capabilityQ2, on theother hand, is not inﬂationary and
will not automatically approach unity with increasing model com-
plexity. Commencing with a very simple model, Q2 will increase
withmodel complexity. However, at a certain degree of complexity,
Q2 will reach a plateau and subsequently reduce. Usually, the point
at which Q2 reaches a plateau is the trade-off point between the
ﬁtting and predictive capability. Besides aforementioned method,
a common alternative to determine model complexity is to exam-
ine the hypothesis test for a given parameter in that model. In this
study, both Q2-statistics and hypothesis testing are used to deter-
mine whether the complexity of an empirical model is adequate or
not.

betweenR2 andQ2 must not be too large andpreferably not exceed-
ing 0.2–0.3. Moreover, a Q2 >0.5 is regarded as good and a Q2 >0.9
as excellent [21]. In this study, the Q2 value for the 83-compound
validation set was 0.5361 and the R2 value for the 400-compound
training set was 0.8474; thus, the proposed method coincides with
this rule of thumb and can be taken as a reasonable model for esti-
mating theAITof anunavailableorunknowncompound inpractical
applications.
5. Conclusions
A predictive model for AITs was proposed based on the SGC
approach. The proposed equation to predict AITs may be expressed
as Eq. (10). This model includes 45 molecular function groups and
is a polynomial of degree 3. This model was deduced from a 400-
compound training set. The ﬁtting ability of the proposed model
is about 0.8474, with an average error of 32K and an average
error percentage of 4.9%. The predictive capability of the model
was demonstrated on 83 compounds which were not included in
the original training set. The predictive capability of the proposed
model is about 0.5361, with average error 70K and an average error
percentage of 11.0%

As compared to Albahri and George’s work, the proposedmodel
exhibits better performance in terms of R2. It was also found that
much of the improvement may be attributed to the modiﬁcation
of the group deﬁnitions and not the type of empirical model cho-
sen. Asmentioned earlier, the addition of halogen atoms to nonring
hydrocarbons and ring-structure compounds has different effects
on their AITs. Thus, in this study, 14 new groups were introduced
to discriminate this effect for halogen compounds.
In this work, the average ﬁtting error for the 400-compound
training set was 32K, and the average prediction error was 70K for
the 83-compound validation set. Because the average experimental
error in measuring the AIT is deemed to be greater than 30K in the
literature, the proposed method could offer a reasonable estimate
of the AIT value for the organic compounds in the training set and
could also approximate the AITs of compounds that were unknown
or whose AITs were not readily available to within a reasonable
degree.
