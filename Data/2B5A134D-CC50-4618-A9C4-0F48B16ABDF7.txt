1. Introduction
Research of squeezing film behaviors concentrates conventionally upon the use of a
Newtonian lubricant. Typical studies are observed in the squeezing parallel plates by
Archibald [1] and Jones and Wilson [2]; the squeezing parallel disks by Moore [3]
and Murti [4]; the squeezing journal bearings by Pinkus and Sternlicht [5]; the
squeezing sphere-plate mechanisms by Conway and Lee [6]; and the squeezing
cylinder-plate systems by Hamrock [7]. Recently, the increasing use of
non-Newtonian fluids as lubricants has received great interests. To prevent the
viscosity varying with working temperature, most of these non-Newtonian fluids are
formed from the base oils blended with various types of high molecular weight
polymer additives. Since the traditional Newtonian continuum theory of fluids
neglects the size effects of additives, a micro-continuum theory by Stokes [8] is
generated to take into account the particle size effects of these kinds of
non-Newtonian fluids. In this fluid model, the couple stress effects are considered as a
consequence of the action of a deforming body on its neighborhood. In the literature
many contributors have applied this micro-continuum theory of couple stress fluids to
investigate the characteristics of bio-fluid flows and squeezing film motions, such as
the peristaltic transport of bio-fluids by Shehaway and Mekheimer [9]; the squeezing
parallel disks by Ramanaiah and Sarkar [10]; the squeeze journal bearings by Lin [11];
and the squeeze sphere-plate mechanism by Lin [12]. However, all the above studies
concerning squeeze film motions with couple stress fluids have neglected the effects
of fluid inertia forces as compared to the viscous forces. Since the fluid velocity varies
the squeezing film pressure, the fluid inertia forces should be considered in the study
of squeeze film motions for growing velocities of the lubricant.
Based upon the micro-continuum theory together with the averaged inertia principle,
the combined effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses and convective fluid inertia
forces on the squeeze film characteristics between a long cylinder and an infinite plate
are investigated. The lubrication equation accounting for the couple stress effects due

the initial minimum film thickness.
6minimum film heights mH for different Re under both the Newtonian-lubricant
and non-Newtonian-lubricant cases. For the Newtonian lubricant case neglecting fluid
inertia ( 0Re ), the maximum pressure increases with decreasing mH . Increasing
the Reynolds number ( 10Re ) increases the maximum pressure. By the use of a
non-Newtonian couple stress fluid ( 1.0L ), more increments in the maximum
pressure are provided especially for larger Re and smaller mH . Totally, the
combined effects of couple stresses and convective fluid inertia on the maximum film
pressure are emphasized at a smaller film height. Figure 3 describes the variation of
non-dimensional load-carrying capacity N with Re for different mH under both
the Newtonian and non-Newtonian cases. The load-carrying capacity increases with
increasing Reynolds numbers for a fixed couple stress parameter and minimum film
height. Comparing with the Newtonian-lubricant case, the non-Newtonian effects of
couple stresses ( 5.0L ) provide a higher load-carrying capacity; more increments are
expected for smaller mH and higher Re . Figure 4 presents the variation of
non-dimensional response time T with mH for different L under both the
Newtonian-lubricant and non-Newtonian-lubricant cases. The presence of couple
stresses is observed to provide an increase in the response time. Since the
non-Newtonian effects of couple stresses ( 5.0L ) result in a higher load-carrying
capacity, a higher film thickness would be attained for the same time to be taken as
compared to the Newtonian-lubricant case. And since the effects of convective fluid
inertia forces result in a higher load-carrying capacity, a longer response time is
observed for the squeeze film system as compared to the non-inertial case ( 0Re ).
On the whole, the combined effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses and convective
inertia forces upon the squeeze film behavior between the cylinder and the plate are
apparent. The response times for the cylinder-plate squeeze film system are
significantly lengthened by the use of an incompressible couple stress fluid and
considering the effects of convective fluid inertia forces.
5. Conclusions
On the basis of the Stokes micro-continuum theory together with the averaged
inertia principle, the combined effects of non-Newtonian couple stresses and
convective fluid inertia forces on the squeeze film characteristics between a long
cylinder and an infinite plate are analyzed. According to the results and discussion,
conclusions are drawn as follows.
A closed-form solution for the film pressure, the load capacity and the response
time is obtained for cylinder-plate squeeze film system. Comparing with the
Newtonian-lubricant non-inertia case, the combined effects of couple stresses and
