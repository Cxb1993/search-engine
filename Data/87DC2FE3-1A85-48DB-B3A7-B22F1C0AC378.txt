二、緣由與目的 
「科技始終來自於人性」這句話主要
是在強調考慮人性的因素，並應用科技的
原理來進行設計；所謂科技產品都應該符
合上述原則。雖然我國在數位科技產品的
製造技術已經領先其他國家，但是數位科
技產品真的考慮到人性嗎？面對各種高
科技卻無人性的產品，使用者還是往往不
知所措。如何利用人性的原理進行創新開
發，來彌補使用者與科技之間的鴻溝，是
重要的課題。基於此， Jordan (1998), 
Marzano (2000), and McDonagh-Philp 
(2002)等學者都認為產品的情感價值
(emotional benefit)是改善產品設計非常重
要的思考重點(Gotesch, 2002)。許多知名
的資訊大廠也注視到這個重要趨勢，例如
HP 公司強調好的資訊產品可以豐富使用
者的生活、荷蘭 Philips公司也提出以人性
化和溫馨的科技產品來滿足消費者的渴
望，並以此方向作為設計的特色，希望讓
產品可以滿足消費者的渴望和夢想
(Marzano, 2000)。Apple公司在推出後 ipod
及 iphone後創造千萬台的銷售佳績，也是
一個鮮明的例子。不約而同的，Sweet

Exploring design innovation and performance: the roles of issue 
related to design strategy

This study examined design cases involving new product development related to Taiwanese electric 
and computer firms for exploring the strategic groups formed by local firms and their performance in 
new product development and other issues related to industrial design innovation strategy. The 
questionnaire survey demonstrates that Taiwanese electric and computer firms, in terms of industrial 
design innovation strategy, can be grouped into technical innovation, gradual innovation, application 
innovation, and aggressive innovation groups. In their response to the challenges faced environmental 
change, firms in different strategic groups exhibited different financial and non-financial performance. 
Furthermore, they differed significantly in dealing with industrial design activities, particularly new 
product development types, product design features, motivations, and design appeals. Differences in 
these aspects may be the reason for their differences in new product development performance. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The fast change of the global industrial structure has cast a 
widespread impact on Taiwan typical electronic and computer 
industry. To the industrial designers in these companies, either 
in the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture) or ODM 
(Original Design Manufacture) style, more attention should be 
paid to the pace of competitors so as to cope with the conflicts 
and challenges brought forth by the global environmental 
change (Chang, 2000). In terms of industrial design, Hsu’s 
study (Hsu, 2006), demonstrated that certain types of strategy 
and action had been adopted by Taiwanese electronic and 
computer firms.  
Cooper and Press (1995) argued that the design process 
bridges market desires and production potential as a strategic 
dimension. In a study that surveyed more than 220 new 
product development projects at British firms, Roy and Riedel 
(1997) demonstrated that the subtle application of design 
innovation could lead to the success of new product 
development project. Numerous researchers have highlighted 
that industrial design and technical innovation play a key role 
in improving the competitiveness of products, firms and 
national economies (Rothwell, 1983; Berger, 1989; Wray, 
1991; Freeman, 1992; Utterback, 1994; Sheldon, 2004; Marxt 
and Hacklin, 2005). Design innovation strategy is considered 
useful as it provides guidelines for industrial design and R&D 
(Baxter, 1995; Wandeback, et al., 2002; Vidal, 2004; Booker, 
et al., 2005). Gemser and Leenders (2001) also indicated that 
an industrial-design-centered new-product development 
strategy can help changes the nature of competition of the 
industries. 
Moreover, Gemser and Leenders (2001) hypothesized that 
design innovation significantly enhances performance. Besides 
product innovation, innovation in terms of design and design 
strategy can help to improve competitiveness regardless of 
industry evolution. Numerous studies have stressed that the 
relationship between industrial design and company 
performance is positive or strongly positive in industries with 
mature strategies for investing in industrial design (Cool and 
Schendel, 1987; Walsh et al., 1992; Baden-Fuller and Stopford, 
1994; Gemser et al., 1996; Gemser, 1999). Cooper (1998) 
hypothesized that product innovation strategy and performance 
are closely linked. The markets, products, and technologies 
that firms select, as well as the orientation and direction of 
their product innovation efforts, markedly influence enterprise 
success and profitability. A survey of industrial product firms 
conducted by Nystrom and Edvardsson (1980) also found a 
close relationship between strategy and performance. 
some of which may include: (1) product function: totally new 
function, reinforcement of existing functions, accessory 
functions, same functions, (2) product operation: totally new 
ways of using the product, adjustment of existing ways of the 
using product, the same as the existing way, and (3) product 
appearance: totally new appearance, adjustment of existing 
appearance, and no change. Their views provide a good 
reference for examining the features emphasized of new 
product development projects in response to environmental 
change. 
 
3. Motivations in product development 
While describing product development strategy, Baxter 
(1995) noted that this kind of motivation could be transformed 
into a goal or commission, which a company should develop a 
strategy for achieving. The comprehension of the motivation 
of a new product will help in the in-depth understanding of 
firm product design strategy. Chang (1998) states several 
possible motivations for new product development, including 
entering a new target market, being ahead of the competition, 
catching up with the market, retailer requests, availability of 
new technologies, and new legislation. Considering practical 
cases of new product development projects in the Taiwanese 
electronic industry (Chang and Hsu, 2003), motivations of 
local firms’ product development can be divided into the 
following four categories: (1) entering new target markets: 
launching products onto new markets that are separate from 
existing ones, (2) being the leader in the market: launching 
new products for upgrading new techniques, being the market 
leader, and increasing their differences from competitors to 
prevent those competitors from catching up rapidly, (3) market 
orientation: the launch of new products is aimed to offer 
products that clients or consumers need to help them 
understand market requirements and generating a survival 
space for new products in the market, and (4) follower: 
launching new products and improving upon existing products 
to follow the market mainstream while limiting research and 
development costs. The motivations discussed above are used 
to study the motivations of new product development projects 
in response to environmental change. 
 
4. Product design appeals 
Design appeals are designed to attract consumer attention or 
interest, and moreover influence consumer impressions 
regarding products or services, or consumer reasons for 
purchasing commodities (Lee and Hsu, 1998). Previously, 
most researchers adopted Kolter’s (2000) classification of 
design appeals, which can be classified into three groups: 
rational appeal, emotional appeal, and moral appeal. Product 
design appeals are frequently used to persuade consumers that 
a product offers some functional or practical benefits so that 
consumers will better understand the clue of a product, thus 
enhancing consumer impressions of the product (Rajesh, et al., 
2001). For Taiwanese electronic firms (Chang and Hsu, 2003; 
Hsu, 2006), their product design appeals can be divided into 
four categories: (1) high-class taste: denoting the 
characteristics of unique tone and advanced functions for 
attracting consumers with high taste, (2) meeting life style: 
meaning that such new products satisfy the lifestyle and living 
condition of consumers, (3) vernacular culture: meaning an 
emphasis on ensuring that the product function and form spit 
the special cultural consumption background of consumers, 
and (4) healthy and environmentally friendly: suggesting that 
such new products can help provide a healthy living 
environment, benefit user health, or contribute to protecting 
the natural environment. This study uses the proposal of Hsu 
(2006) as a reference for examining the strategies used to 
design new product development projects in response to 
environmental change. 
 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
 
The study focused on strategic business units (SBUs), 
autonomous divisions, and individual firms in the Taiwanese 
electronic and computer industry. The subjects were selected 
from Taiwanese electronic and compute manufacturers listed 
in the 2005 directory of the Taiwanese Electrical and 
Electronic Manufacturers Association (TEEMA) as the target 
population, and 478 firms were included in the survey.  
The questionnaire involved a two stage work. During the 
first stage, firm CEOs were invited to participate in the study 
through a mail of the research questionnaire accompanied by 
an informational letter. From April to May 2005, 210 
questionnaires, 43.93% of the total poll, were employed for 
statistical analyses. The respondent firms employ between 68 
and 50,000 people (M=655; sd=787; 48% of firms had <500 
employees, 31% had 501-1,000 employees, and 21% had 
>1,001 employees). This stage of the research method aims to 
gather strategic variables for classifying strategic groups of 
electronic and computer firms.  
During the second stage of the study, the firm product 
design or product development managers were invited to 
participate in the study through an exhaustive mail of the 
research questionnaire accompanied by an informational letter. 
A questionnaire survey was performed from April to May 
2006, in which 210 companies questioned during the first stage 
were asked again to gather data regarding new product 
development. Some firms did not return the questionnaire for 
certain reasons. Finally, 137 questionnaires, or 28.66% of the 
total poll, were obtained. 
 
RESULTS AND ANALYSES 
 
Product Design Strategic Groups 
 
Through principal component analysis, four factors were 
extracted from 20 strategic variables, with 67.48% cumulative 
percentage of total variance, meaning that these four factors 
are sufficiently typical to represent the original 20 variables. 
To simplify the factor structure and to clarify these factors, the 
Varimax method of orthogonal rotation (Lin, 1992) was 
selected for explaining the four factors, which had Eigen 
values exceeding 1 (Robert and Wortzel, 1979). Table 1 lists 
the result of the principal component analysis of the product 
design strategy.  
Closely examining the structure of variables in Table 1 
reveals that Factor 1 was entitled the low cost and high quality 
factor, Factor 2 was entitled the company identity factor, 
Factor 3 was entitled the design ability factor, and Factor 4 
was entitled the R&D ability factor. This study employed 
two-stage cluster analysis (Anderberg, 1973; Punj and Stewart, 
1983). Using the factor scores of each firm, the method of 
positive results: a high proportion of success, and low failure 
and skill kill rates. The new product effort is profitable, but 
yields a low proportion of sales by new products and has a low 
impact on the business’s sales and profits (Cooper, 1998). 
The companies in the gradual innovation group are passive 
in corresponding to the change in business environment and 
fall to the bottom in performance ranking. The companies in 
the gradual innovation group lacking technological 
sophistication frequently develop new products that are low 
technology, me-too, and low-risk, and rely on simple and 
mature technologies. Generally, these enterprises do not adopt 
an offensive stance and seek to serve market needs that they 
have not previously served (Cooper, 1998). 
 
The Roles of Issue Related to Design Strategy 
 
1. New product development types 
Table 4 lists the results of one-way ANOVA and the Scheffe 
multiple comparison test. Among new product development 
types, companies in four strategic groups differed markedly in 
the variables of “incremental improvements to existing 
products”, “new product platforms”, and “fundamentally new 
products”. Table 4 reveals that, compared with the aggressive 
innovation group and the application innovation group, the 
technical innovation group is more likely to adopt incremental 
improvements to existing products. On the contrary, the 
aggressive innovation group and the application innovation 
group tend to adopt new product platforms and fundamentally 
new product strategies. The comparison of new product 
development performance demonstrates that the strategic 
groups that place more emphasis on new product platforms 
and fundamentally new product strategies will have better 
product development performance than the strategic groups 
that adopt incremental improvements to existing products. This 
finding suggests that different innovation orientations are 
associated with differences in performance (Lambkin, 1988; 
Robinson et al., 1992; Franklyn and Ven, 1996). Furthermore, 
it also confirms that enterprises adopting new-to-the-world or 
new-to-the-firm product lines will be more successful 
(Booz-Allen and Hamilton, 1982; Cooper, 1998). This implies 
that firms may perform better at larger magnitude of alteration. 
 
2. Strategic groups and product design features 
Among ten product design features, significant differences 
existed in six variables, namely “totally new function”, 
“reinforcement of existing functions”, and “accessory 
functions”, relating to product function, “totally new way of 
using product” of product operation, “totally new appearance”, 
and “adjustment of existing appearance” relating to product 
appearance. Table 5 lists the results of one-way ANOVA and 
Scheffe multiple comparison test. 
In terms of product functions, the aggressive innovation 
group place increased emphasis on totally new functions in 
comparison to the gradual innovation group. Compared with 
the gradual innovation group, the aggressive innovation and 
technical innovation groups tend to place more emphasis on 
reinforced existing functions. In contrast, the gradual 
innovation group places more emphasis on accessory functions 
than the technical innovation group. In terms of product 
development performance, strategic groups that stress totally 
new functions and reinforced existing functions will 
outperform those that adopt accessory functions. Regarding 
product operation, the aggressive and application innovation 
groups place more emphasis on totally new methods of using 
products than the gradual innovation group. In these three 
strategic groups, the one that pays more attention to totally 
new methods of using products will have better overall product 
development performance. Finally, in terms of product 
appearance, the aggressive innovation group places more 
emphasis on totally new appearance than the gradual 
innovation group and the gradual innovation group tends to 
place more emphasis on adjusting existing product appearance 
than technical innovation group. The comparison of overall 
product development performance also indicates that strategic 
groups which stress totally new appearance will perform better. 
This echoes the previous finding that performance improves 
with increasing alteration magnitude. 
 
3. Strategic groups and product development motivations 
Among four product development motivations, companies 
in four strategic groups differed markedly in the variables of 
“entering the new target market”, “being the leader in market”, 
“market orientation”, and “follower”. Table 6 illustrates the 
results of one-way ANOVA and the Scheffe multiple 
comparison test. The analytical results demonstrate that, in 
terms of product development motivations, the aggressive 
innovation group tends to enter new target markets and 
become the leader in market much more than the technical 
innovation and gradual innovation groups. 
Compared with the aggressive innovation group, the 
technical innovation and application innovation groups are 
more market oriented and likely to be a follower. Further 
comparing the product development performance of four 
strategic groups demonstrates that strategic groups stressing 
entering new target markets and being market leaders, such as, 
aggressive innovation group, will display improved overall 
performance. The strategic groups stressing a market 
orientation policy and being followers, such as, the technical 
innovation group, also exhibit good performance. However, 
strategic groups that lack clear motivations, such as, the 
gradual innovation group, will fall behind in terms of new 
product development performance. Additionally, the 
phenomenon of the technical innovation group placing more 
emphasis on market orientation and being a follower in 
comparison to the application innovation group appears 
contradictory to the policy of R&D (Cooper, 1998). This result 
whether happened particularly or coincidently in the electronic 
and computer industry which is frequently does not involve 
high technology needs further exploring. 
 
4. Strategic groups and product design appeals 
Finally, among four product design appeals, companies in 
four strategic groups were considerably different in the 
variables of “high-class taste”, “meeting life style”, 
“vernacular culture”, and “healthy and environment friendly”. 
Table 7 lists the results of one-way ANOVA and the Scheffe 
multiple comparison test. Regarding product design appeals, 
the application innovation group is more likely to plead for the 
high-class taste than the technical innovation and gradual 
innovation groups. In addition, the aggressive innovation 
group is more likely to plead for the meeting life style, 
vernacular culture, and healthy and environmentally friendly
