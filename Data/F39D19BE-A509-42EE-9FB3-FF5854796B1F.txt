Experimental Procedure 
 
The ceramic materials (1-x) (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x BaTiO3 
(NBT-BT) were mixing with two different methods. The 
first, reagent-grade raw materials of Na2CO3, Bi2O3, 
BaCO3, and TiO2 with higher than 99.5% purity were 
used as starting materials, mixed according to the 
compositions (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3 and BaTiO3, and ball- 
milled for 5h with de-ionized water. After drying and 
ground, then the (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3 and BaTiO3 powders 
were calcined at 850oC and 1100oC for 2h, respectively. 
After calcinations, the powders were ground again and 
mixed with the compositions of (1-x) (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x 
BaTiO3, for x=0.03, 0.05, and 0.07 (CM-series, 
abbreviated as CM-3, CM-5, and CM-7, respectively). 
The second, the reagent-grade raw materials were mixed 
according to the composition of (1-x) (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x 
BaTiO3, where x=0.03, 0.05, and 0.07 (C-series, 
abbreviated as C-3, C-5, and C-7, respectively). After 
drying and ground, then the (1-x) (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x 
BaTiO3 powders were calcined at 900oC for 2h. 
 
After grinding, the polyvinylalcohol (PVA) was added 
into the CM-series and C-series as a binder. The mixing 
powders were uniaxially pressed into pellets in a steel 
die with the size of 1mm in thickness and 12mm in 
diameter. After debindering, the sintering of CM-series 
and C-series ceramics was carried out from 1120oC to 
1240oC for 4h. The morphologies of sintered CM-series 
and C-series ceramics were observed by using SEM and 
the crystal structures were also investigated by using 
XRD patterns. The sintered ceramics were painted with 
Ag-Pd paste and sintered at 700oC for 15min. 
Temperature-dependent dielectric characteristics were 
measured with oscillating amplitude (50mV) at 10 
kHz~1 MHz by an impedance analyzer, HP4294, putting 
the sintered ceramics in a temperature-programmable 
testing chamber. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
The morphologies of (1-x) (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x BaTiO3 
(NBT-BT) ceramics are investigated and the results are 
shown in Fig.1. Sintered at 1120°C, the (1-x) 
(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x BaTiO3 ceramics show a porous 
structure and the grain growth is not observed (not 
shown here). For C-3 ceramic sintered at 1160oC, as 
shown in Fig.1(a), the grain growth is observed and 
almost no pores are observed. For 1160oC-sintered C-7 
ceramic, as shown in Fig.1(b), the grain growth is not 
apparently observed and the pores are observed. The 
needed sintering temperature (1350oC~ 1400oC) of 
BaTiO3 ceramic is higher than that (1150oC~ 1200oC) of 
(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3 ceramic, for that the increase in the 
BaTiO3 content will increase the needed sintering 
temperature. Further increasing the sintering temperature 
to 1200oC, the grain size of C-3 ceramic increases 
apparently and the C-7 ceramic reveals a normal grain 
growth, as shown in Fig.1(c)~1(d).  
 
Fig .2 shows the micrographs of CM-series ceramics as a 
function of sintering temperatures, and the grain growth 
of CM-series ceramics has the similar trend as that of 
C-series ceramics does. As the results in Fig.2 are 
compared, sintered at the same temperature, the grain 
size decreases with the increase of BaTiO3 content and 
the grain size of CM-7 ceramic is small than that of 
CM-3 ceramic. However, there are some differences 
between the grain growth of C-series and CM-series 
ceramics. The first, for the same composition and same 
sintering temperature, the CM-series ceramics have the 
larger grain sizes than the C-series ceramics do. For 
CM-3 ceramic sintered at 1160oC, a densified surface 
with no pores can be obtained. Even the few pores are 
existed, the grain growth of 1160oC-sintered CM-7 
ceramic is apparently observed but the C-7 ceramic 
reveals a porous structure. Those results suggest that the 
needed sintering temperatures of CM-series ceramics are 
lower than those of C-series ceramics. The second, the 
morphologies of the C-series and CM-series ceramics are 
the square type. But the difference is that C-series 
ceramics reveal the cubic-typed grains. The BaTiO3 
content and the fabrication processes have large 
influence on sintering characteristics of (1-x) 
(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x BaTiO3 ceramics, and furthermore, the 
BaTiO3 content and the fabrication process will have 
large influence on dielectric characteristics of (1-x) 
(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x BaTiO3 ceramics.

the measured Curie temperatures of C-series ceramics 
and CM-series ceramics are lower than those of 
predicted values.

Fig.5 The Curie temperatures of (1-x) (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x 
BaTiO3 ceramics as a function of measured frequencies 
and fabrication process, sintered at 1200oC. 
 
Figure 6 shows the maximum dielectric constants 
(revealed at Curie temperatures, εmax) of (1-x) 
(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x BaTiO3 ceramics as a function of 
sintering temperatures and fabrication process, and the 
measured frequency is 1MHz. For C-series and 
CM-series ceramics and sintered at 1120oC, the εmax 
values decrease with the increase of BaTiO3 content. The 
pores increase with the increase of BaTiO3 content will 
be the reason. For the CM-series ceramics, the εmax 
values linearly increase as the sintering temperatures 
increase; For C-series ceramics, the εmax values critically 
increase as the sintering temperatures increase from 
1120oC to 1160oC and then the εmax values slightly 
increase as the sintering temperatures are further 
increased. As the sintering temperatures are higher than 
1160oC, the maximum dielectric constants, εmax, of 
C-series and CM-series ceramics increase with the 
increase of BaTiO3 content. From the results shown in 
Fig.2 and Fig.3, the grain sizes of C-series ceramics and 
CM-series ceramics decrease with the increase of 
BaTiO3 content. For that, the grain sizes are not the 
important factor that will influence the maximum 
dielectric constants of (1-x) (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-x BaTiO3 
ceramics, but the BaTiO3 content will be.
