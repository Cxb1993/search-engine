Abstract 
Many decision-making or choice problems in Marketing incorporate preferences. 
How to assist decision makers in understanding the decision context and improving 
inconsistencies in judgments are two important issues in ranking choices. This study 
develops a decision-making framework based on the screening, ordering, and choosing 
phases. Two optimization models and a Decision Ball model are proposed to assist 
decision makers in improving inconsistencies and observing relationships among 
alternatives. By examining a Decision Ball, a decision maker can observe ranks of and 
similarities among alternatives, and iteratively adjust preferences and improve 
inconsistencies thus to achieve a more consistent and informed decision.

Part I (Decision Making) 
1. Introduction 
Many decision-making or choice problems in Marketing incorporate preferences (Liechty 
et al, 2005; Horsky et al. 2006; Gilbride and Allenby, 2006). Keeney (2002) identified 12 
important mistakes frequently made that limit one’s ability in making good value judgments, in 
which “not understanding the decision context” and “failure to use consistency checks in 
assessing value trade-offs” are two critical mistakes. Hence, how to assist decision makers in 
understanding the decision context and adjusting inconsistencies in judgments are two important 
issues in ranking choices. 
There is evidence that decision makers’ preferences are often influenced by the visual 
background information (e.g., Simonson and Tversky 1992; Tversky and Simonson, 1993; 
Seiford and Zhu, 2003). From marketing it is known from consumer choice theories that context 
impacts the choices consumers make (Seiford and Zhu, 2003). For example, a product may 
appear attractive against a background of less attractive alternatives and unattractive when 
compared to more attractive alternatives (Simonson and Tversky, 1992). Visual representations 
can simplify and aggregate complex information into meaningful pattern, assist people in 
comprehending their environment, and allow for simultaneous perception of parts as well as a 
perception of interrelations between parts (Maruyama, 1986; Meyer, 1991; Sullivan, 1998). 
Hence, how to provide visual aids to help decision makers make a more informed decision is the 
first issue addressed by this study. 
Ranking alternatives incorporating preferences is a popular issue in decision-making. One 
common format for expressing preferences is to use pairwise comparisons, which forces one to 
make a direct choice of one object over another when compariing two objects, rather than 
requiring one to comparing all objects simultaneously (Cook et al., 2005). For example, in sports 
competitions, such as tennis, football and baseball, pairwise rankings are the typical input 
(Hochbaum and Levin, 2006). Several methods have been proposed (e.g., Saaty, 1980; Jensen, 
1984; Genest and Rivest, 1994) to rank alternatives in pairwise comparisons fashion. However, 
inconsistencies are not unexpected, as making value judgments is difficult (Keeney, 2002). The 
ranks different methods yield do not vary much when the decision makers’ preferences are 
consistent.  But, if a preference matrix is highly inconsistent, different ranking methods may 
produce wildly different priorities and rankings.  Hence, how to help the decision makers to 
detect and improve those inconsistencies thus to make a more reliable decision is the second issue 
addressed here. 
Multicriteria decision makers tend to use screening, ordering and choosing phases to find

Several visualization approaches have been developed to provide visual aids to support 
decision-making process. For instance, Li (1999) used deduction graphs to treat decision 
problems associated with expanding competence sets. Jank and Kannan (2005) proposed a spatial 
multinomial model of customer choice to assist firms in understanding how their online 
customers’ preferences and choices vary across geographical markets. Kiang (2001) extended a 
self-organizing map (SOM) (Kohonen, 1995) network to classify decision groups by neural 
network techniques. Many studies (Kruskal, 1964; Borg and Groenen, 1997; Cox and Cox, 2000) 
adopted Multidimensional scaling (MDS), which is widely used in Marketing, to provide a visual 
representation of similarities among a set of alternatives. For instance, Desarbo and Jedidi (1995) 
proposed a new MDS method to spatially represent preference intensity collected over 
consumers’ consideration sets. However, most of conventional visualization approaches are 
incapable of detecting and improving the decision makers’ inconsistent preferences. Gower 
(1977), Genest and Zhang (1996) proposed a powerful graphical tool, the so-called Gower Plot, to 
detect the inconsistencies in decision maker’s preferences on a 2-dimensional plane. Nevertheless, 
the Gower plots do not provide suggestions about how to improve those inconsistencies either. 
A pairwise-comparison ranking problem can be provided with magnitude of the degree of 
preference, intensity ranking; or in terms of ordinal preferences only, preference ranking. These 
are sometimes referred to also as cardinal versus ordinal preference (Hochbaum and Levin, 2006). 
Many studies (Saaty, 1980; Saaty and Vargas, 1984; Hochbaum and Levin, 2006; etc.) use 
multicriteria decision making approaches to find a consistent ranking at minimum error. However, 
conventional eigenvalue approaches cannot treat preference matrix with incomplete judgments. 
And, most of them focus on adjusting cardinal or ordinal inconsistencies instead of adjusting both 
cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies simultaneously. Li and Ma (2006)(2007) developed goal 
programming models which can treat incomplete judgments and improve cardinal and ordinal 
inconsistencies simultaneously. However, the ranks of and similarities among alternatives can be 
displayed.  
This study cannot only improve cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies simultaneously but 
provide visual aids to decision makers. They can observe ranks of and similarities among 
alternatives, and iteratively adjust their preferences to achieve a more consistent decision. 
 
3. Setting the Decision-Making Framework 
The proposed decision-making framework is illustrated by the screening, ordering, and 
choosing phases as listed below: 
(i) The screening phase: the decision maker tries to screen out clearly unwanted alternatives. 
The decision maker specifies upper and/or lower bounds of attributes to screen out poor 
alternatives. 
      
 8
and upper bounds of the criterion value of ck, respectively. The value of kc  and kc  can be 
either given by the decision maker directly or calculated by the minimum and maximum raw 
criterion value of ck . The score function in this study is assumed to be in an additive form because 
it is the most commonly used form in practice and more understandable for the decision maker 
(Belton and Stewart, 2002). Denote Si as the score value of an alternative Ai. An additive score 
function of an alternative Ai (ci,1, ci,2, …, ci,m) is defined as below:

of alternatives are positive, a criterion ci,k with cost feature (i.e., a DM likes to keep it as small as 
possible) is transferred from ci,k to ( kik cc , ) in advance.  
Following the score function, the dissimilarity function of reflecting the dissimilarity 
between alternatives Ai and Aj is defined as

where 1)(0 ,  wji  and )()( ,, ww ijji   . Clearly, if ci,k = cj,k for all k then )(, wji = 0.  
In the ordering phase, a decision maker has to roughly specify partial order of alternatives. 
If the decision maker prefers Ai to Aj, denoted as ji AA  , score of Ai should be higher than that of 
Aj (Si > Sj). However, there may be some inconsistent preferences. For instance, a decision maker 
may specify ji AA  , kj AA  and ik AA  . A binary variable ti,j is used to record the inconsistent 
relationship between Ai and Aj: if ji AA   and Si > Sj, then ti,j =0; otherwise, ti,j = 1. A weight 
approximation model for ordering phase is developed as follows:

Denote di,j as the Euclidean distance between Ai and Aj . Let jijid ,, 2 , such that if 
ji,  = 0 then di,j = 0 and if ji,  = 1 then di,j = 2 , where 2  is used because the distance 
between the north pole and equator is 2  when radius = 1. Denote the coordinates of an 
alternative Ai on a ball as (xi, yi, zi). The relationship between yi and Si is expressed as 
Proposition 2  .2 2iii SSy 

Based on the non-metric multidimensional scaling technique, denote jid ,ˆ  as a 
monotonic transformation of ji,  satisfying following condition: if qpji ,,   , then 
qpji dd ,, ˆˆ  . The coordinate (xi, yi, zi) of alternative Ai all i can be calculated by the following

The objective of Model 2 is to minimize the sum of squared differences between di,j and 
jid ,ˆ . Expression (8) is from Proposition 2, where the alternative with a higher score is designed 
to be closer to the North Pole. Expression (9) is the monotonic transformation from ji,  to jid ,ˆ .

An optimization model, developed by a goal-programming optimization technique, is 
developed to assist decision maker in detecting and improving inconsistencies. In order to reduce 
the ordinal inconsistency, a binary variable ui,j is used to record if the preference pi,j, specified by 
the decision maker, is suggested to be reversed or not. If pi,j is suggested to be reversed, then ui,j  
= 1; otherwise, ui,j = 0. A variable ji , , defined as the difference between pi,j and Si/Sj, is used to 
indicate the degree of cardinal inconsistency of pi,j: the larger the value of ji , , the higher the 
cardinal inconsistency. The inconsistencies improving model is formulated as below:

This model tries to improve ordinal and cardinal inconsistencies simultaneously. The first 
objective (Obj1) is to achieve ordinal consistency by minimizing the number of preferences 
(i.e., jip , ) being reversed. Constraint (14) means: when jip ,  and 1, jip , ui,j = 0, if (i)

Model 2.  
According to the information visualized on the Decision Ball, the decision maker can 
iteratively adjust his preferences by the following ways: 
(i)    Adjusting preference order. Since alternative with a higher score is designed to be closer 
to the North Pole so that a decision maker can see the rank order by the location of 
alternative: the higher the latitude, the higher the score. If the decision maker would like 
to adjust a preference order, from A1  A3 to A1  A3  for instance, a constraint 
 31S S  will be added into Model 3.  
(ii)    Adjusting dissimilarity. The distance between two alternatives on a Decision Ball implies 
the dissimilarity between them: the larger the dissimilarity, the longer the distance. 
Therefore, if a decision maker observes the Decision Ball and decides to adjust the 
dissimilarity relationship, from  )()( 2,13,1 ww    to  )()( 2,13,1 ww   for example, 
a constraint  )()( 2,13,1 ww    (i,e. 

be added into Model 3. 
(iii)   Adjusting preference matrix. A decision maker can choose to adjust the preference matrix 
directly. The value of pi,j in Model 3 will be modified according to the change in the 
preference matrix.  
Solving Model 3 yields a new set of weights, and an adjusted Decision Ball will be 
displayed. The decision maker can iteratively adjust his preferences until he feels no adjustments 
have to be made. A final choice can be made with the assistance of a resulting Decision Ball. 
 
6. Application to choice data: selection of a store location 
Example 1 (Selection of a store location) 
The choice of a store location has a profound effect on the entire business life of a retail 
operation. Suppose a manager of a convenience store in Taiwan who needs to select a store 
location from a list of 43 spots A = {A1, …, A43}. The manager sets four criteria to fulfill: (c1) 
sufficient space, (c2) high population density, (c3) heavy traffic, and (c4) low cost. Store size is 
measured in square feet. The number of people who live within a one-mile radius is used to 
calculate population density. The average number of vehicle traffic passing the spot per hour is 
adopted to evaluate the volumes of traffic. Cost is measured by monthly rent. The criteria values 
of 43 candidate locations are listed in the criterion matrix C1, as shown in Table 1.  
The manager would like to rank choices incorporating his personal preferences. The 
manager can rank these choices by the following three phases: 
      
 16
A8, A13, A3, A7, A17, A34, A24 and A32 are remaining for the next phase. 
Phase 3 – the choosing phase 
In the choosing phase, the manager uses pairwise comparisons to express preferences 
among pairs of choices in preference matrix R1, as listed in Table 2. Because the manager is 
unable to make comparison among some spots, the relationships p3,34, p7,17, p8,24, p13,34 are left 
blank, which means R1 is incomplete. The preference matrix R1 is ordinally inconsistent because 
there is an intransitive relationship among A3, A8 and A32. That is, A3 is preferred to A8 (p3,8 > 1), 
and A8 is preferred to A32  (p8,32 > 1); however, A32 is preferred to A3  (p3,32 < 1). R1 is also 
cardinally inconsistent. For instance, there exists p3,8 = 1.6, p8,13 = 2.5; but, p3,13 = 2 (1.6   2.5 = 
4, that is 13,313,88,3 ppp  ).  
Applying Model 3 to the example yields Obj1 = 1, Obj2 = 3.91, u3,8 = 1 and the rest of ui,j 
= 0, (w1, w2, w3, w4) = (0.04, 0.19, 0.06, 0.71), (S3, S7, S8, S13, S17, S24, S32, S34) = (0.55, 0.55, 0.78, 
0.27, 0.39, 0.40, 0.74, 0.51). The variable u3,8 = 1 implies that the value of p3,8 is suggested to be 
changed from p3,8 >1 to p3,8 <1 (i.e. from A3  A8 to A3 A8) to improve ordinal inconsistency. 
The values of unspecified preferences can be computed as p3,34 = 
34
3
S
S  = 1.08, , p7,17, = 1.41,  
p8,24 = 1.93, and p13,34 = 0.76. The corresponding Decision Ball is shown in Figure 3. The order of 
alternatives is A8  A32  A3  A7  A34  A24  A17.  
According to the information observed on the Decision Ball, the decision maker can 
iteratively adjust his preferences. Suppose he would like to adjust a preference order from A7 
A34 to A34 A7.  A constraint  734S S  is added into Model 3. Solving Model 3 yields 
Obj1 = 3, Obj2 = 3.96, u3,8 = u7,34 = u17,24 = 1 and the rest of ui,j = 0, (w1, w2, w3, w4) = (0.01, 0.13, 
0.17, 0.69), (S3, S7, S8, S13, S17, S24, S32, S34) = (0.53, 0.50, 0.76, 0.27, 0.44, 0.40, 0.71, 0.51). In 
order to satisfy the relationship A34 A7, the relationship between A17 and A24 has to be reversed 
(u17,24 = 1). Applying Model 2 to this result yields a new set of coordinates. An adjusted Decision 
Ball is displayed in Figure 4. On this Decision Ball, the latitude of A34 is higher than that of A7.  
By seeing the relationships of alternatives displayed on the Decision Ball in Figure 4, the 
decision maker would like to adjust some dissimilarity relationships between alternatives. His 
adjustment is that the dissimilarity between A3 and A8 is larger than that of between A7 and A8. A

Part II (Business Schools Ranking) 
 
1. Introduction  
 
Path dependency theory argues that a standard which is first-to-market can 
become entrenched – this "path dependence" can persist even if it is an inferior standard 
because of the legacy that this standard has established. This theory was developed from 
Paul David’s description of how the QWERTY layout on the keyboard of typewriters 
largely became the standard even though it was not necessarily the best layout for a 
keyboard (David, 1985, 1986). The theory is now widely utilized in the social sciences 
although it is yet to be significantly employed in management science. This research 
examines changes in business school rankings over a five year period to examine the 
impact of path dependency on the rankings of business schools. 
The research on business school rankings began to appear in the late 1970s 
(Hunger and Wheelen, 1980; Schatz, 1993). Since those initial efforts a number of 
popular rankings of business school have developed such as the Business Week (BW) 
ranking which began in 1988, Financial Times (FT) in 1995, Economist (Econ) in 1996, 
Forbes in 1999, and Wall Street Journal in 2000 (Business Week, 2006 and 2009; 
Financial Times, 2006 and 2009; U.S. News & World Report, 2006, 2007, and 2009; 
Economist.com, 2009). Numerous schools focus on the rankings and seek to improve 
themselves in order to move up the rankings. However, path dependency would indicate 
that the changes the schools are making may not necessarily be changing the school to be 
better. Instead, path dependency would indicate that the schools are simply changing 
themselves to be more like the market leaders. Thus, the manner in which someone 
      
 22
2. Path Dependency Theory 
The path-dependence perspective argues that actors are not free when selecting a 
social process because former decisions and a given organization’s foundation conditions 
would have an impact on later decisions (Arthur 1989; David 1985). This occurs since as 
organizations make choices they develop an incentive to stay on the same path as others 
in the organization or other organizations in the industry. The result is individuals in the 
firm or more broadly firms in an industry adopt the same choice as market leaders. This 
leads to individuals or organizations actions reinforcing existing patterns of behavior 
rather than seeking new alternatives. Thus, individuals or organizations in an industry 
become locked in a trajectory, no matter whether this is the best choice. 
This trajectory is the result of reinforcing feedback loops that are created 
(Burgelman, 2002). Once a successful path is created then there is a narrowing of the 
strategic options as organizations assume that there the given path will lead to success 
(Helfat, 1994). Thus, it can be that other strategic options are in fact excluded from 
consideration. Schumpeter pointed out that any system designed to be efficient at a point 
in time will not be efficient over time (Bruton et al., 1994). Thus, pressures on managers 
to change can come from changes in institutional environment or changes in a market, or 
both. However, these pressures to break from the existing path and create a new path 
      
 24
1993). For ranking criteria, the Carter Report used the frequency of faculty publications 
in academic journals, asked the deans of the business schools to vote on the best program, 
and questioned business school faculty about which schools they thought were the best. 
In 1979, through collecting opinions from deans at business schools accredited by 
AACSB and senior personal executives in industry, Hunger and Wheelen (1980) ranked 
business schools using four criteria: faculty reputation, academic reputation, student 
quality, and curriculum. 
Ball and McCulloch (1984) later conducted a survey using ten criteria (namely, 
Faculty Quality, Internationalization, Faculty Research, Reputation, Publications, 
Competence of Graduates, Graduate Placement, Student Quality, Number of Students, 
and Foreign Study Internships) to rank business schools by collecting 212 questionnaires 
from 1286 Academy of International Business members. In the same year, Laoria (1984) 
ranked business schools in New Jersey by sending questionnaires to 83 business schools 
in New Jersey and 65 corporations that had headquarters in New Jersey. Brecker & 
Merryman Inc. (1985) ranked American business schools by surveying executives at 134 
national companies of the 250 largest industrial and service firms. Since these two initial 
ranking efforts a wide variety of studies discussing business school rankings appeared.  
 
3.2 Dominant Current Business School Methodology 
 Although various business school rankings exist, NWR and FT are two of the most 
popular media. NWR started to rank business schools in 1987. The methodology adopted 
by NWR is first to standardize collected data under each criterion by weighting the 
standardized scores, secondly to rescale the scores so that the top school received 100 and 
      
 26
evaluated by a selected group of 40 English language journals (10% of the weight). It has 
argued that due to cultural biases embedded in the ranking methodology, FT rankings are 
dominated by English-speaking business schools (Financial Times, December 23, 2009).  
Insert Tables 1-2 here. 
 
4. Testable Proposition  
 
It was noted before others have observed that the various methods to rank schools 
largely generate the same set of top schools (Morgeson and Nahrgang, 2008). The 
greatest variation in the impact in any method is not among the very top schools but in 
the second and third tier schools. These general observations indicate that path 
dependency may be driving the rankings of business schools. That is, the top schools are 
being judged as the model and the various ranking methods are driven not by what may 
be the best business school but rather the ranking methods seek to reinforce the belief that 
established top schools are what all schools should look like. 
Since this research is an exploratory effort to examine this important effort we will 
propose a proposition rather than a hypothesis. If support is found for the proposition we 
will then develop at the end of the paper an agenda for research on this important topic. 
Therefore, we propose: 
Proposition 1:  Path dependency results in those top ranked business schools 
staying largely the same over time with changes in business schools focused 
mainly on second and third tier business schools seeking to become more like the 
leading schools.  
5.  Methods 
5.1 Scoring Business Schools 
      
 28
observations into some pre-specified number of clusters and them evaluate them by 
pre-defined criteria, hierarchical clustering is to partition observations by creating a 
hierarchical decomposition tree via either agglomerative or divisive approach, 
density-based clustering considers clusters as regions and partition observations by 
judging the density function within a specified neighboring scope, grid-based clustering 
uses a grid data structure to quantize the data space into a finite number of cells on which 
clustering is then carried out, and model-based clustering is to partition observations by 
optimizing the fit between the data and the used model. 
 However, traditional clustering that partitions observations into two-dimension 
space with the coordinates of x-axis and y-axis. In this exploratory research our desire is 
to see a richer and more descriptive understanding of the movement among business 
schools. Therefore this study will employ a novel clustering algorithm which can cluster 
schools on a three-dimension space with the coordinates of x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. 
Obviously, in one dimension, all observations are clustered very close and not easily to be 
visualized as shown in Fig. 1(a), meanwhile in two dimension, all clustered observations 
become more sparse but restricted to deal with linear distance as shown in Fig. 1(b). A 
three-dimension sphere can depict points with nonlinear relationships as shown in Fig. 
1(c) and can deal with the relations of four points which not on the same plane as 
depicted in Fig. 1(d). Particularly, as here we are focusing on exploratory research we 
will employ a clustering method that will allow greater visualization of the rankings since 
it will help us to better understand the potential for path dependency. 
Insert Figs 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), and 1(d) here. 
Therefore, this study employs the two axes to cluster observations while the third 
      
 30
and Brusco, 2008). Therefore, after using weighting attributers to value business schools, 
the next important step is to generate the dissimilarity matrix between business schools. 
To calculate the similarity between schools, the dissimilarity function is formulated 
below: 
dij =
 
L
k kk
kjki
k cc
cc
w
1
,, || ,                                        (3) 
where ci,k denotes the value of the attribute k for school I, kc  and kc  denote the upper 
and lower bounds of ci,k, L is the number of attributes, kw  are weights for attribute k. 
Accordingly, if ci,k = cj,k for all k then dij = 0, and if ci,k = kc  and ci,k = kc  then dij = 1. 
Besides, 0  dij 1 and dij = dji. 
 
Following the formula (3), the dissimilarity matrixes among top American business 
schools are summarized in Tables 6 and 7 for NWR and FT systems, respectively. The 
value of dissimilarity coefficient between schools represents the degree of dissimilarity. 
That is, the smaller the value of dissimilarity coefficient, the more similar two business 
schools are. For example, d12 = 0.4057 and d23 = 1.2806 express that the dissimilarity 
degree between the schools 2 and 3 is triple that between the schools 2 and 1. 
Insert Tables 6-7 here 
 
5.4 Rule for allocating objects on three-dimension sphere 
 
To allocate items on the sphere first denote the coordinates of the i’th school as (xi, 
yi, zi), where 10  ix , 10  iy , and 10  iz . To link the y-axis and the ranking 
scores, the relationship between yi and si (the score of the i’th school) is computed as yi = 
2si - si2. The reason behind this equation is stated below: 
      
 32
longitude, y-axis is the vertical middle axis of the sphere. Constraint (5) is to specify the 
relationship between yi and si based on Proposition 1, which provides a scale adjustment 
for schools’ ranking tiers. Constraint (6) is to determine the distance between school i and 
school j subject to their dissimilarity coefficients dij, Constraints (7) and (8) aim to ensure 
that all points must be allocated on the sphere. Notably, the concept of monotonic 
increasing function is used to scale y value for all schools, and si is determined by 
Formula of (1)-(2). 
 
6.  Analysis  
 
The first part of this section is to analyze the current business rankings, while the 
second part is to analyze clustered business schools on the three-dimension sphere. 
 
6. 1 Analysis of Current Business School Ranking Results 
 
Following Tables 1-2 and Functions (1)-(2) used by NWR and FT, the scores of 
worldwide business schools can be generated. However, for the purpose of simplifying 
illustration, this work use top 50 American business schools ranking data during the last 
five -year period produced by NWR and FT. Since FT ranked worldwide business schools, 
the rankings listed in the columns of FT are renumbered after removing non-American 
business schools (as shown in Tables 3 and 5). Accordingly, the scores of top 50 
American business schools at 2009, ranking by NWR and FT by their respective ranking 
function (1) and (2), are displayed in Table 3. What is clear in looking at Table 3 is that 
there is relative stability in both ranking systems on what are the best schools in 2009 (i.e., 
10 of the top 12 schools and 13 of the top 15 are listed in both ranking methods). Tables 
4-5 list the ranking of schools across 2005-2008. What is clear is that the schools at the 
      
 34
re-calculate the business schools scores, this work found that approximate 54% of school 
ranks across 2005-2009 are changed. This phenomenon is similarly occurred in NWR 
system. However, it is interesting to note that the top 12/15 schools ranking is impacted 
the least. Thus, the criteria are set in ways that supports these leading schools as dominant 
powers. The change in the second and third tier standings as the result of such changes in 
weightings shows that they can have greater stability in their ranking but becoming more 
like the leaders in multiple dimensions. It is interesting to note that this study also found 
most schools are clustered in the same groups across years even if their individual ranks 
have changed. As a result, this phenomenon may lead to that change in ranking place is 
easier than in ranking tier when few changes occur in the school data, and school 
clustering is more stable than the school ranking. These two facts together provide 
support for path dependency view of business schools. 
Organizational change covers a wide range of topics but the overlying concern is 
that it is a “process of continually renewing an organization’s direction, structure, and 
capabilities to serve ever changing needs” (Moran & Brighton, 2001). There are a variety 
of different models of organizational change that have developed including Luecke’s 
(2003) seven step model, Kottler’s (1996) eight step model, and Kanter’s (1992) 10 step 
model of organizational change. The various models of organizational change share the 
belief that change in organizations is typically the result of triggers. The trigger leads 
organizations to recognize the need for the change, generate the vision for the change, 
and to be willing to implement the change. For a firm such a trigger could be a negative 
profit report. For a business school, such a trigger could be a business school ranking 
report.
