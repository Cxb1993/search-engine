Overall Abstract 
This project investigates the self-assembled nanostructures and relevant phase transitions of 
block copolymers bearing special molecular architecture.  The systems to be investigated include 
(1) linear comb-coil diblock copolymers, (2) hetero-arm star comb-coil copolymers, (3) block-arm 
star comb-coil copolymer and (4) linear rod-coil block copolymers derived from conjugated 
semiconducting polymers.  In addition to the complexity associated with the molecular 
architecture, both the comb and the rod blocks in these systems exhibit the propensity to form 
mesophases or liquid crystalline phases.  Under the competition or interplay between two 
self-organization driving forces, the copolymers are expected to display much more complex phase 
behavior than the conventional coil-coil diblocks and hierarchical nanostructures with multiple 
length scales are expected to develop through such a competitive interaction. Furthermore, we have 
extended our study to the diblock copolymers bearing a stereoregular block to examine the role of 
stereoregularity in the self-assembly behavior and phase transition of the copolymer systems.  
 
A number of important original results have been obtained from this project, including: (1) a 
systematic investigation of the effect of grafting density of comb block on the hierarchical 
assembly behavior of a linear PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) comb-coil diblock copolymer.  We center on 
the effect of grafting density on the morphology of the larger-scale copolymer domains and the 
orientation of the smaller-scale lamellae organized by the comb block relative to the larger-scale 
copolymer domain; (2) detailed study of the the hierarchcal assembly of rod-coil diblock 
copolymer/coil homopolymer blend using DEHPPV-b-PMMA/h-PMMA blend as he model 
system.  The effect of hPMMA molecular weight on the solubilization behavior in the 
microdomain and the morphology of the blend have been systematically revealed for the first time; 
(3) the discovery of a thermodynamically stable ordered bicontinuous double diamond (OBDD) 
structure for a slightly asymmetric syndiotactic polypropylene-block-polystyrene (sPP-b-PS)  
bearing the stereoregular sPP block.  Furthermore, a thermally reversible order-order transition 
between OBDD and gyroid structure has been revealed.  Other important results include our 
continued study of the effect of molecular architecture on the self-assembled structure and phase 
transition of comb-coil block copolymers, the discovery of a highly unusual lower critical 
ordering transition of PEO-b-P2VP.  Most of these important findings have been published in the 
best journal in polymer science, Macromolecules, and a number of manuscripts are under 
preparation and will be submitted to the high-impact journals.

1. Molecular Architecture Effect on the Self-Assembly Behavior of Comb-Coil Block 
Copolymers Displaying Lamellae-within-Lamellae Morphology 
 
Introduction 
Block copolymers constitute a special class of materials capable of self-assembling into a series 
of long-range ordered nanostructures driven by the incompatibility between the covalently 
connected blocks.1 Polymers with comb-shaped architecture also display the propensity to 
self-organize due to the repulsion between the backbone and the short side chains.2 The covalent 
bonds through which the side chains attach to the backbone may be replaced by the physical bonds 
such as ionic bonds,3,4 hydrogen bonds5-7 or metal-mediated coordination bonds8-10 to yield the 
“supramolecular comb polymers”, which may analogically self-organize to form mesomorphic 
nanostructures.11,12  
An even richer variety of ordered nanostructures can be formed if the comb architecture is 
introduced into the block copolymer by selectively complexing one of the blocks in a coil-coil 
diblock copolymer with a surfactant.13 The resultant “supramolecular comb-coil diblock 
copolymer” displays two distinct levels of self-organization; one gives rise to the larger-length-scale 
copolymer domain (typically of several tens of nanometers) driven by the microphase separation 
between the comb and the coil blocks, and the other yields a smaller-length-scale lamellar structure 
(with the interlamellar distance of several nanometers) due to the segregation between the polymer 
backbone and the surfactant tails in the comb block. “Structure-within-structure” is an appropriate 
term for describing such a morphological pattern. Moreover, due to the presence of two structure 
units with different length scales, two order-disorder transition (ODT) temperatures (TODT) can be 
defined for the comb-coil copolymers, namely, TODTL and TODTS corresponding to the TODT of the 
larger-scale copolymer domain and the smaller-scale mesophase organized by the comb block, 
respectively.14,15  
The supramolecular comb-coil concept was pioneered and widely investigated by Ikkala and 
co-workers.5,8,10,13,16-21 In addition to the rich variety of hierarchical nanostructures, the 
mesomorphic order of the comb block also exerts interesting influence on the self-organization 
behavior of the coil block. For instance, the smaller-scale lamellar mesophase was found to induce 
an anomalous tetragonal packing of the larger-scale cylindrical domains organized by the coil block 
in a supramolecular comb-coil diblock formed by complexation of polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinyl 
pyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) with dodecyl benzenesulfonic acid (DBSA).24 
With the advancement of synthetic techniques, block copolymers with non-linear architectures, 
including hetero-arm star,14,25-30 block-arm star, H-shaped, and  -shaped,31,32 are now brought into 
investigation. Recently, we have been interested in the microphase separation and the ODT of 
supramolecular comb-coil copolymers bearing non-linear architecture.14,15  It is known that the 
non-linear copolymers also self-assemble to form well-ordered nanostructures; however, 
 prepared by mixing appropriate quantity of the two solutions which would prescribe the 
stoichiometric binding of the surfactants to P4VP block. Most of the solvent was evaporated at 
room temperature. Finally, the samples were dried under vacuum at 60 oC  for 48 h to remove the 
residual solvent. All the complexes with DBSA were further annealed at 140oC for 48 hrs to 
enhance the long-range order of the copolymer domains.  
 
3. Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) Measurements. The temperature-dependent SAXS 
experiments in a heating cycle were conducted to probe the morphologies of the copolymers. The 
samples were first equilibrated for 20 min followed by data acquisition for 1 h at each measuring 
temperature under vacuum. The SAXS instrument was equipped with a 3.0 KW X-ray generator 
operated at 40 KV x 35 mA (NANOSTAR, Bruker Co, Ltd.) and a two-dimensional 
position-sensitive proportional counter with 512 x 512 channels. The Cu Kα line (λ= 0.154 nm) was 
used. The intensity profile was output as the plot of the scattering intensity ( I ) vs. the scattering 
vector, )2/sin()/4( q , where   is the scattering angle. All data were corrected by the 
empty beam scattering, the sensitivity of each pixel of the area detector and thermal diffuse 
scattering (TDS).  
 
4. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) Observations. The real-space morphologies were 
observed by a JEOL JEM-2000FXZ transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 100 kV. 
The copolymer specimens were microtomed at -60 °C with a Reichert Ultracut E low-temperature 
sectioning system. The microtomed sections were collected onto copper grids coated with 
carbon-supporting films and then stained for 10 min in RuO4 vapor. Since RuO4 was a preferential 
staining agent for PS, PS and P4VP-containing domains appeared as dark and bright regions in the 
micrographs, respectively. 
 
5. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Measurements. The phase transitions of PDP in the 
complexes were investigated by a TA instrument 2000 Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). 
The samples were heated from 30 °C to 100 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min.  
     
Results 
1. Comb-Coil Copolymers with Hydrogen-Bonding Complexation.  
A. L1(PDP) system. Figure 1(a) and 1(b) display the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of 
L1(PDP) system in the temperature range of 30-200 oC. The SAXS profile at 30 °C showed a 
scattering maximum at q = 0.31 nm-1. A broad peak superposing with a few relatively sharp peaks 
was observed in the high-q region (q   1.6 nm-1). The low-q peak corresponding to the domain 
spacing of 20.27 nm was associated with the larger-scale copolymer domain structure arising from 
the microphase separation between PS and P4VP(PDP) blocks. The high-q peaks were contributed 
by the smaller-scale structure organized by the P4VP(PDP) comb blocks. It was difficult to identify 
 microdomains. 
Figure 1(c) also displays the change of the high-q peak intensity (Im(S)) with temperature above 
70 oC. Im(S) was found to decrease monotonically with increasing temperature, but a steeper drop 
was identified above 110 °C, which lied closely to TODTL. We considered this temperature as the one 
at which the detached PDP molecules (due to breakage of hydrogen bonds) in the disordered comb 
block domains started to diffuse into the PS domains, which eventually homogenized the whole 
system. 
Figure 4 shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of L1(PDP) system obtained during 
subsequent cooling experiment from 200oC to 30oC.  The re-appearance of scattering peaks at both 
low- and high-q region during cooling showed that the structural features described above were 
thermally reversible. The thermal reversibility observed also showed that the sample was thermally 
stable under the experimental condition employed for the SAXS experiments. 
 
B. H1(PDP) system. Figure 5(a) and 5(b) show the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of 
H1(PDP) system. The scattering curves at low temperatures showed a primary maximum at 0.21 
nm-1 and two weak higher-order peaks at 0.42 and 0.66 nm-1. Another peak with strong intensity 
was observed in the high-q region at 1.62 nm-1. Similarly, the SAXS peaks in the low-q region were 
attributed to the larger-scale copolymer domain structure. The integral ratio of the peak positions 
signaled the formation of a lamellar morphology with the interlamellar distance D = 29.92 nm 
consisting of alternating PS and P4VP(PDP) layers. This morphology was expected considering the 
rather symmetric composition of the comb-coil copolymer ( PSf = 0.45).  
The high-q peak at 1.62 nm-1 stemmed from the smaller-scale lamellar mesophase formed by 
P4VP(PDP) combs with d = 3.9 nm. Hence, H1(PDP) system also self-organized into a 
lamellae-within-lamellae morphology. Upon heating to 80 °C, the intensity of the high-q peak 
dropped sharply (cf. Im-1(S) vs. T-1 plot in Figure 5(c)) coupled with peak broadening, signaling that 
the lamellar mesophase underwent an ODT (i.e. TODTs   80 oC). This ODT event was confirmed 
by the DSC thermogram in Figure 3, showing a small endotherm at 79.7 °C due to the transition 
from the mesophase to the isotropic phase for the P4VP(PDP) comb blocks. The DSC thermogram 
also showed a larger endotherm (ΔHt ~ 10 J/g ) at 21.2 oC, which was  attributed to the melting of 
PDP crystallites. It should however be noted that the PDP crystallites in this system completely 
melted below 30 oC and hence the SAXS profile collected at the lowest temperature in Figure 5(a), 
i.e., 40 oC, did not show the sharp peak associated with the PDP crystallites superposing on the 
broader peak in the high-q region.    
As can be seen in Figure 5(c), Im(L) did not show any abrupt decrease up to 170 oC and hence the 
larger-scale copolymer domains were stable up to at least 170 °C (i.e. TODTL >170 oC). The SAXS 
profiles collected in subsequent cooling experiment also demonstrated that the structural features 
were thermally reversible (cf. Supporting Information). Hence, both TODTL and TODTS of H1(PDP) 
were higher than those of L1(PDP), which was consistent with our previous results on the 
 ODT of the smaller-scale structure existed in this sample near this temperature (also see Supporting 
Information). Such a discontinuous drop in intensity was not prescribed for a correlation hole peak.  
 Figure 8(b) presents the Im-1 vs T-1 plots for the primary scattering maxima associated with the 
larger-scale and the smaller-scale structures. Abrupt drops of intensities were identified near 220 °C 
in both cases, indicating that the disordering of the larger-scale lamellar structure (ODTL) occurred 
almost concurrently with that of the smaller-scale mesophase (ODTS), that is, TODTLTODTS220 
°C. In this case, the occurrence of ODTL induced the mixing between the coil and comb blocks, and 
hence disrupted the smaller-scale structure simultaneously.  
Figure 9 shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of L2(DBSA) obtained during 
subsequent cooling from 260 oC to 30 oC.  The scattering peaks at both low- and high-q region 
re-appeared during cooling, which showed that the structural features described above were 
thermally reversible.  
 
D. H2(DBSA) system. Figure 10(a) shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles of 
H2(DBSA). The scattering pattern showed a primary maximum associated with the larger-scale 
structure at 0.22 nm-1 and another strong peak of the smaller-scale mesophase at 2.33 nm-1. The 
inset shows the Lorentz-corrected Iq2 vs. q plot at 30 °C in the low-q region. It can be seen that a 
weak second-order peak became visible, which signaled that the system formed a larger-scale 
lamellar morphology with D   28.56 nm. This was further corroborrated from the SAXS data 
obtained using a synchrotron radiation facility (cf. Supporting Information). Consequently, 
H2(DBSA) also exhibited the lamellae-within-lamellae morphology. Again, it was rather 
unexpected that H2(DBSA) with PSf  = 0.75 could self-organize into a larger-scale lamellar 
morphology. Another interesting feature worth noting was that though H2(DBSA) displayed a less 
ordered larger-scale lamellar structure than L2(DBSA), its smaller-scale mesophase was more 
ordered as demonstrated by a sharper high-q peak. 
Figure 10(b) shows the corresponding Im(L)-1 and Im(S)-1 vs. T-1 plots. Although Im(L) and Im(S) 
decreased above 200 °C, the intensity changes were indeed small comparing with those found in 
Figure 7(b) for L2(DBSA). Consequently, we concluded that the morphology of H2(DBSA) was 
much more stable than that of L2(DBSA), as the ODTs were not accessible up to 260 °C. This 
result was again consistent with our previous study, showing that the order-disorder transition 
temperatures of the comb-coil copolymer with star architecture were higher than those of the linear 
counterparts. 
Table 2 summarizes the morphological parameters and TODTs of the six systems studied. All 
copolymers were found to display lamellae-within-lamellae morphology. 
 
Discussion 
A. L1(PDP) versus H1(PDP). The molecular weight and the composition of L1 and H1 were very 
similar. Therefore, a close comparison between the self-assembly behavior of L1(PDP) and 
 76.0PSf  and 75.0PSf , respectively, formed lamellae-within-lamellae morphology. 
Ruokolainen et al.17 had investigated a series of linear PS-b-P4VP(nonadecylphenol) 
(PS-P4VP(NDP)) comb-coil copolymers with different compositions. The systems with PSf = 0.75 
and 0.76 were found to display lamellae-within-cylinder or the lamellae-within-sphere morphology, 
namely, the comb block formed cylindrical or spherical microdomains dispersed in the PS matrix. 
Due to the same kind of block copolymer being used, the unexpected lamellae-within-lamellae 
morphology of L2(DBSA) was attributed to the very short P4VP blocks (Mn = 1290) in the 
PS-b-P4VP used here. To form a lamellae-within-cylinder or lamellae-within-sphere morphology, 
the P4VP(DBSA) comb block needs to form large microdomains so as to reduce the interfacial 
curvature for the regular stacking of the smaller-scale lamellae. However, large microdomains could 
not be formed by the very short P4VP block; therefore, lamellar microdomain becomes the 
favorable structure for enhancing the stacking of the smaller-scale lamellae. 
Additionally, as compared to hydrogen-bonded systems (P4VP(PDP) or P4VP(NDP))  
investigated previously with the same composition, the DBSA was strongly ionically bound to 
P4VP in the present systems. In this case, we were dealing with a densely grafted P4VP brush 
which required a higher interfacial area then the hydrogen-bonded P4VP chains.44  Thus, a 
lamellar morphology was more plausible for the present system despite compositional asymmetry. 
    
D. Interdomain Distances of the Larger-Scale Structures. It is clear from Table 2 that the 
interlamellar distance of the larger-scale lamellar structure formed by the copolymer domains (D) 
was larger for the hetero-arm star systems than that of their linear counterparts, irrespective of the 
strength of the surfactant binding. In our previous study of the comb-coil copolymers displaying 
cylinder-within-lamellae structure, the domain spacing of the larger-scale structure was found to be 
smaller in hetero-arm star copolymers.15 The smaller D in star system was attributed to the lower 
aggregation number of the PS blocks within the cylindrical microdomains due to its peculiar 
architecture. This finding was different from the previous studies of coil-coil block copolymers26-30 
showing that the star copolymers exhibited a larger domain spacing than the corresponding linear 
diblock, because the arm crowding near the junction points resulted in strong chain stretching. 
However, the difference in D found for coil-coil systems was typically less than 15%, but for the 
present comb-coil systems showing lamellae-within-lamellae morphology the difference was 40-76 
%. Therefore, the anomalously large D must be caused by other factors.  
We propose that the key factor governing the interlamellar distance is the arrangement of the 
comb blocks forming the smaller-scale lamellar mesophase.  Figure 11 shows two possible types 
of arrangement, i.e., mono-layer (ML) and double-layer (DL), of the P4VP(PDP) or P4VP(DBSA) 
combs in both linear diblock and hetero-arm star copolymers.  The interlamellar distance 
associated with the DL arrangement is apparently larger.  We propose that the comb blocks in the 
star copolymer complexes adopted DL arrangement, whereas those in the linear systems organized 
in ML.  The advantage of adopting ML arrangement was that the PS blocks could acquire more 
 between conformational entropy and interfacial energy in the copolymer system and resulted in 
different arrangement of the comb blocks. All hetero-arm star copolymers in the present study were 
proposed to arrange their comb blocks into double layers, while the mono-layered arrangement 
appeared to be more favorable for the comb blocks in their linear counterparts. As a consequence, 
the interlamellar distances of the copolymer domains in the hetero-arm star systems were 
significantly larger than those associated with the linear diblocks.  The junction constraint also 
influenced both TODTL and TODTS of the comb-coil copolymers. Hetero-arm star complexes 
displayed higher TODTL and TODTS than the linear complexes, irrespective of the binding force of the 
surfactant to the P4VP block, because of the lower entropy change associated with the ODTs.

 2. Anomalous Phase Transition of Supramolecular Comb-Coil Diblock Copolymer with 
Respect to the Increase of Binding Density 
Block copolymers with two or more covalently connected chains constitute self-assemblies of 
nanoscale microdomains with well-defined geometries. Due to the repulsion between the blocks, 
the self-assemblies can separate into a variety of morphologies. The physics controlling block 
copolymer phase behavior involve the competition between interfacial tension and the entropic 
penalty for stretching of polymer chains to fill space uniformly. An essential parameterin all block 
copolymer separation is interaction parameter (Flory-Huggins parameter), χAB that provides a 
driving force for phase separation. Another parameter is the total degree of polymerization N. For 
large N, the loss of translational and configuration entropy leads to a reduction of the A-B monomer 
contacts and thus to local ordering. Moreover, volume fraction (f) of one block of the block chains 
also plays an important role. With increasing one block of copolymer, the curvature of boundary 
between blocks will change and cause variable morphologies. Therefore, the segregation product 
χN and f determine the degree of microphase separation of block copolymers. According to 
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) worked by Mastenet al.,the phase diagram shows the sequence 
of phase change: Lamellae, gyroid, cylinder, spheres and disordered as f progresses from 0.5 to 0 or 
1[1-4].  
A specific case of self-assembling materials is given by polymeric comb-shaped block copolymer 
consisting of repulsive flexible or mesogenic side chains, which are bonded to the main chain with 
hydrogen [5-10], ionical [11,12], or coordination bind [13]. The self-assembly of comb-coil block 
copolymers can yield a hierarchical structure-within-structure morphology with two distinct length 
scales. Due to the mutual repulsion of the blocks and packing constraint imposed by connectivity of 
each block, microphase separation can be formed at the length scale of tens of nm. In comb blocks, 
normally a lamellar mesosphese with the length scale of several nanometers forms derived from the 
microphase separation between the polar backbone and nonpolar side chains. Therefore, 
combination of two above concepts contributes to the hierarchic structure [14]. 
Among the geometries of the microdomain, the cylindrical microdomain formed by block 
copolymers has been found to organize almost in a hexagonal lattice. Under some special 
interactions, tetragonal packing can be observed. Take examples. T-shaped liquid crystals with 
nonpolar lateral side chains form cylindrical domains. When the lateral chain is moved to a more 
central position, it needs less spacing and hence enables slightly efficient packing [15]. Another 
example is that the cationic dendronized polymers complex with anionic lipids, where the polymer 
backbone represents the cylinders. When the surfactant is kept at fixed length, with increasing 
generation, steric hindrance between dendrons becomes predominate factor [16]. Linear and 
hetero-arm ABC triblock copolymers also compose two types of cylinders formed by the two ends 
of polymers in the tetragonal co-array lattice [17].  
 normal view, respectively, for the geometry of SAXS measurements. 
Small angle x-ray scattering technique is capable to give information on the structural features as 
well as their spatial correlation. The SAXS instrument was equipped with a 3.0 KW X-ray generator 
operated at 40 KV x 35 mA and a two dimensional position-sensitive proportional counter with 512 
x 512 channels. The Cu Kα line, i.e. =0.154 nm, was used. The area scattering patterns of the 
isotropic samples have been radially averaged to generate the intensity profiles output as the plots 
of the scattering intensity (I) vs the scattering vector, q=4π/λ[sin(θ/2)] (θ=scattering angle). The 
empty beam scattering and the sensitivity of each pixel of the area detector have corrected the 
scattering intensities. 
The real-space morphologies of PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) were observed by a JEM-2000FXZ 
transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. The specimens were microtomed at -60 °C 
using a Reichert Ultracut E low-temperature sectioning system. The ultrathin sections were picked 
onto the copper grids coated with carbon-supporting films followed by staining by exposure to 
RuO4 vapor for 3 min. RuO4 is a preferential staining agent for P4VP(DBSA), so the P4VP(DBSA) 
phase appears dark in the TEM micrographs. 
In this work, we used PS-b-P4VP with f(PS)=0.57 to prepare our samples. Figure 1(a) exhibits 
the SAXS profile of PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.25. In the low q region (q<0.2nm-1), a series of diffraction 
peaks with the position ration of 1: 2: 3: 4: 5 indicate the lamellar packing symmetries of large-scale. 
The interlamellar distance between PS layer and P4VP(DBSA) layer calculated by the primary peak 
(2π/q*) is 21.37nm. Furthermore, the first-order reflection of the small-scale lamellar mesophase 
can be observed at ca.1.72nm-1 , corresponding to a spacing of 3.65nm.  The peak is broad due to 
the low binding ration of DBSA to P4VP, in which DBSA can stretch free. The 2D pattern of 
PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.25 is shown in Figure 1(b). Note that the organization of large-scale 
microdomains give rise to a series of diffraction arcs at the meridian; while, the orientation 
associated with lamellae stacks formed by comb blocks in the outer region of 2D pattern is not 
obvious. According to the azimuthal scan of the diffuse ring, the intensity is also higher at the 
meridian. Therefore, both inner and outer arcs located in the meridian indicates that small-scale 
lamellar interface lie parallel to the large-scale, i.e. edge-on orientation. Interestingly, the previous 
studies of the typical orientation of comb-coil copolymer displaying the lamellar-within-lamellar 
morphology showed orthogonal orientation, so as to decrease the interlamellar free energy. It seems 
that the relative orientation between the two length-scale of PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.25  is induced by 
other driving force that outweighs the weaker interlamellar interaction.      
   Figure 2(a) demonstrates the SAXS result of PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.3. From the position ratio of 1: 
2: 70.5: 3: 130.5: 4 in low-q region, the packing symmetry of large-scale is either cylinder or cylinder 
coexisting with lamellae mesophase. It seems that the sample, PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.3, is a transition 
phase between lamellae and cylinder. The 20.5 or 30.5 reflection was not observed, presumably due 
 high temperature coupled with an annealing effect may destabilize the tetragonal structure. In other 
word, the tetragonally packed cylinder may be a metastable phase.  
    An interesting hierarchy for PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.55 is shown in Figure 6(a). The SAXS profile 
shows two intriguing scenarios: one is that the intensity of secondary peak is higher than the 
primary one and the other is the peak ratio can not exactly identify to one certain structure. The 
pattern is characterized by a series of diffraction peaks with the position ration of 1:(4/3)0.5: 
30.5:(12/3)0.5:(16/3)0.5: 70.5:~(28/3)0.5, which indicates that the possibility of coexistence of 
bicontinuous gyroid (Ia3d) and the hexagonally packed cylinder structure. However, the appear of 
bicontinuous gyroid is quite strange here due to the classical phase diagram calculated by SCFT. 
Figure 6(b) displays the TEM micrographs of the x=0.55 copolymer, showing the top view of the 
cross section of PS cylinders. Interestingly, the cylinders with both tetragonal and hexagonal 
packing are observed in the micrographs. While, we do not observed the 3-fold or 4-fold projection 
of the bicontinuous Ia3d microstructures. Due to the complex scattering patterns, we employ the 
software “Scatter 2.0” obtained from Prof. Stephen Förster’s group at the University of Hamburg, 
Germany to help us analyse the SAXS curves. The defects from finite grain size and lattice 
distortion from thermal fluctuations as well as distribution of microdomain were considered in the 
calculation. We use gyroid, hex and square models to locate the peaks, as shown in Figure 6(b). 
Combining the result of TEM and the calculated scattering curves, we conclude that hexagonally 
and tetragonally-packed cylinder may coexist and the latter may be the dominated morphology due 
to its higher intensity of the primary peak at q*=0.296nm-1 than that of hexagonal packing at 
q*=0.256nm-1. 
    When the binding fraction reaches to 0.6 and 0.65, the PS microdomain transforms into 
hexagonally-packed cylinders.  Figure 7(a) display the SAXS pattern of PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.6 
with the position ration of 1:30.5:70.5 in low-q region. Noticed that the pattern of radial view shown 
in Figure 7(b) contains a pair of inner arcs, contributing to the backbone chains, located at the 
meridian and another pairs of outer arcs, corresponding to P4VP(DBSA) layers, located at the 
equator. This clearly identifies the orthogonal orientation. The pattern for PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.65 
reveals the same as that for PS-b-P4VP(DBSA)0.6. 
    The orientation of small-scale lamellae organized by the comb block with respect to the larger- 
scale PS microdomain is identified. The transformation is form edge-on orientation to orthogonal 
orientation with increasing binding fraction. The situation resembles three parts of free energy: the 
elastic energy of stretching for the PS block, the interfacial energy determining by Flory-Huggins 
interaction parameters XPS-P4VP, XPS-DBSA, XP4VP-DBSA, and the elastic energy of stretching for the 
comb block. For the orthogonal orientation, it allows P4VP(DBSA) lamellae to stack regularly 
around the PS microdomain over a long distance and hence induces the free energy of interlamellar 
interaction. Therefore, with increasing the amount of DBSA, the driving force for orthogonal 
orientation becomes a significant role. According to the previous study, either

 In this work, we investigate the morphology of DEHPPV-b-PMMA/h-PMMA blends as a 
function of  and h-PMMA composition.  It is our objective to reveal the role of  on the degree 
of solubilization of h-PMMA in the PMMA microdomain.   The DEHPPV-b-PMMA  
(fPMMA=0.30) used here showed lamellar structure.7 Figure 1 displays the SAAXS profiles of 
DEHPPV-b-PMMA/h-PMMA blends with various h-PMMA molecular weights.  Most scattering 
curves showed distinct diffraction peaks with integral position ratio, showing the formation of a 
lamellar structure in the blends.  Interestingly, the second-order peak, which is observable for neat 
diblock, vanishes in the SAXS profiles of the blends, which means that the volume fractions of the 
DEHPPV and PMMA lamellar microdomains are almost equal (i.e., fDEHPPV = ~0.5). Figure 2 shows 
the variations of the lamellar thicknesses and interlamellar distance as a function of overall volume 
fraction of PMMA.  The coil domain thickness is found to increase with increasing PMMA 
content, while the rod domain thickness remains essentially unperturbed.  
The invariant of the rod domain thickness with blend composition implies that the cross 
sectional area of the junction point remains unperturbed. Therefore, we, we propose that the 
solubilization of h-PMMA in the lamellar microdomain follows the “dry brush” behavior.  
Although the h-PMMA is selectively solubilized in the PMMA microdomains, it does not 
significantly swell the PMMA block chains and tends to be more locialized in the middle of the 
microdomains because the entropy of mixing is too small to compensate the loss of conformational 
entropy due to excessive stretching of PMMA chains if h-PMMA were uniformly solubilized.     
The morphology of the blends is also observed by TEM.  The TEM micrographs in Figure 3 
reveal the coexistence of two types of structure in the blends, namely, a lamellar structure (with 
fDEHPPV ~ 0.5 according to SAXS result) and a phase composing of wormlike DEHPPV micelles.  
The spatial correlation of the wormlike micelles in the disordered micelle phase gives rise to a 
low-q peak besides the primary lamellar peak in the SAXS profile.  Based on the SAXS and TEM 
results, we conclude that the present DEHPPV-b-PMMA/h-PMMA blends undergo macrophase 
separation, yielding a copolymer-rich phase and a h-PMMA-rich phase.  The former is 
characterized by a lamellar nanostructure with fDEHPPV ~ 0.5 and the later shows a wormlike micelle 
structure.  The phase diagram represented by the plot of  vs. PMMA overall volume fraction is 
shown in Figure 4.   
Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) is used to characterize the packing of the DEH-PPV rods 
in the rod microdomain; the results are shown in Figure 5. The peak at q=6.5 nm-1 corresponds to 
lateral rod-rod packing distance.8 This peak is found to stay at a fixed position with increasing 
amount of hPMMA. Nevertheless, as homopolymer fraction increases, the primary peak intensity 
reduces, which means that the introduction of additional coil component perturbs the rod order 
packing within the smectic structure.  
The WAXS profiles collected as a function of temperature are shown in Figure 6. The peak 
intensity decays gradually, suggesting that the heating process causes the disruption of rod-rod 
packing. At 200℃, the peak almost disappears, showing the complete disruption of the liquid

 frustration. This postulate was supported from the self-consistent mean-field theory (SCFT) 
calculations for the blends of A-b-B with homopolymer A (h-A), where the addition of h-A to the 
minority domains in the blend preferentially filled the space in the center of A domains, thereby 
relieving the packing frustration and stabilizing the OBDD structure over a very narrow range of 
composition.26,27 Although both theoretical and experimental studies have predicted or reported the 
existence of the OBDD phase in A-b-B/h-A blends, the order-order transition (OOT) between 
equilibrium OBDD and OBDG has never been found thus far. 
In this study, we disclose the formation of the OBDD morphology in the solvent-cast film of a 
slightly asymmetric diblock copolymer composing of a stereoregular block, syndiotactic 
polypropylene (sPP), and a conventional coil block, polystyrene (PS). This OBDD structure 
transformed to the OBDG phase upon heating the sPP-b-PS to ca. 155 oC and the OBDG structure 
transformed back to OBDD on subsequent cooling even in the temperature range above melting 
temperature of sPP. The thermal reversibility of the morphological transformation indicated that 
OBDD is an equilibrium structure in the present diblock system. The stability of the OBDD phase 
in the present diblock melt will be discussed by considering the relief of the free energy cost of the 
packing frustration by local packing of conformationally ordered segments of sPP blocks in the melt, 
a new physical factor brought about by the stereoregularity of the block chain. Our finding presents 
a new scenario that the introduction of stereoregularity into the constituting block may release the 
packing free energy of diblock chains in the microdomain space, which in turn stabilizes the 
otherwise unstable nanostructure. 
 
Experimental Section 
Materials and sample preparation. The sPP-b-PS diblock copolymer (Mn,sPP = 6800, Mn,PS = 9400, 
PDI = Mw/Mn = 1.19) studied here was prepared in two steps according to the procedure reported in 
the literature.28 First, 4-methylstyrene-capped sPP (Mn = 6800, PDI = 1.32), which served as 
end-functionalized prepolymer, was prepared by syndiospecific polymerization of propylene 
conducted in the presence of 4-methylstyrene and hydrogen using Me2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2 as the 
catalyst. Second, the 4-methylstyrene-capped sPP was converted into silylchloride-capped sPP, 
which was in situ treated with living anionic polystyrene (Mn = 9400 g/mole, PDI = 1.02) to yield 
the sPP-b-PS (the detailed synthetic and purification methods for sPP-b-PS can be found in the 
literature28). Figure S1 of the Supporting Information shows the 1H NMR spectrum of the resulting 
sPP-b-PS. The successful preparation of a structurally well-defined sPP-b-PS sample can be further 
elucidated by the GPC analysis shown in Figure S2 (in the Supporting Information), which 
compares the GPC elution curves of the 4-methylstyrene-capped sPP (Mn = 6800, Mw/Mn = 1.32) 
and the living anionic polystyrene (Mn = 9400 g/mole, Mw/Mn = 1.02) with that of the sPP-b-PS (Mn 
= 16200 g/mole, Mw/Mn = 1.19). The volume fraction of sPP block in this sample was 0.46 in the 
melt state.29  
 temperature for 5 min followed by data acquisition for 5 min. The scattering profiles are presented 
as a function of q/qm, with qm being the position of the primary peak (see Table 1) for clear 
identification of the change of the relative peak positions with temperature. The SAXS profile 
observed at 25 oC showed five peaks; the ratios of the higher-order peak positions to the primary 
peak position were not integral, indicating that the diblock did not exhibit lamellar morphology in 
spite of its rather symmetric composition. The observed position ratios were indeed consistent with 
that prescribed by the OBDD structure (the red curve).33 The relative intensities of the observed 
peaks also agreed quite well with those of the calculated profile except for the fourth-order peak. 
This discrepancy may be attributed to the approximation of the form factor of the building block by 
the cylindrical form factor in calculating the theoretical SAXS pattern. When the copolymer was 
heated to 170 oC, the position of the second-order peak relative to that of the first-order peak shifted 
clearly from (3/2)1/2 to (4/3)1/2, and the scattering pattern became consistent with that associated 
with the OBDG phase. Therefore, a phase transition from OBDD to OBDG occurred upon the 
heating. 
The observed SAXS profiles at the lower temperatures T   125 oC were identified as the 
scattering from the OBDD symmetry with 4-fold nodes rather than OBDG symmetry with 3-fold 
nodes, judging from the fact that the observed peak position ratios matched with those predicted by 
the OBDD structure much better than those predicted by the OBDG phase. Since another ordered 
bicontinuous structure, Fddd, also has 3-fold nodes,34 it is important to clearly distinguish the 
OBDD structure from the Fddd structure. For this purpose, the observed peak position ratios were 
further compared with those associated with the orthorhombic Fddd phase exhibiting the scattering 
peak position ratio of 1: 1.22: 1.55: 1.72: 1.81: 1.95: 2.00, etc.34, as shown by the solid blue lines in 
Figure 1b. Except for the second-, fourth- and seventh-order peaks (i.e. q/qm = 1.22, 1.72 and 2 ) of 
Fddd structure which were close to the observed second-, fourth-, and fifth-order peaks of OBDD, 
the third-, fifth- and sixth-order ones (i.e. q/qm = 1.55, 1.81 and 1.95) of Fddd were not identified in 
our observed SAXS profile. Consequently, we ruled out the formation of Fddd structure in the 
present diblock copolymer as well as the order-order phase transition from OBDD to Fddd as an 
order-order transition from 4-fold nodes to 3-fold nodes. 
Since the equilibration time at each temperature was short in the synchrotron SAXS 
experiment despite of the higher resolution for the scattering peaks, we conducted an in-house 
SAXS measurement to examine the thermodynamic stability of the phases and the thermal 
reversibility of the phase transition with much longer equilibration time at each temperature. Figure 
2 shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles (focused on the first four scattering peaks) taken 
with the in-house SAXS measurements of the as-cast sPP-b-PS (the entire scattering profiles are 
shown in Figure S5 of the Supporting Information), where the sample was annealed at each 
temperature for 30 min followed by data acquisition for 1 h. Similar to that found in Figure 1, the 
 after the sample has been isothermally annealed at 140 oC for 24 h followed by quenching to liquid 
nitrogen to freeze the structure formed at 140 oC (see Figure S7 of the Supporting Information). It is 
obvious that the scattering profile still matched well with that prescribed by the OBDD phase, 
showing that OBDD in sPP-b-PS diblock copolymers is a stable structure. 
To observe the OBDD structure in real space, the annealed sample was cut into the ultrathin 
section for observations with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The formation of OBDD 
phase was evidenced by the micrograph displayed in Figure S8 of the Supporting Information, 
showing the image of the rhombus pattern. As indicated by Hasegawa et al.17, the projection from 
the [100] direction of a double-diamond (DD) lattice would give rise to a square-lattice image (see 
Figure S8 of the Supporting Information). The rhombus lattice image observed here should arise 
from a slight tilt of such a square lattice. The slight tilt made the projection vector slightly deviate 
from the [100] direction, so that the sequentially-connected rods with an inclined angle were 
projected as an undulation pattern as observed in the image.  
Our SAXS results have thus revealed the occurrence of a thermally-induced OBDD-OBDG 
OOT in a sPP-b-PS diblock copolymer. Although such a phase transition has not been found for 
diblock copolymers previously, Benedicto et al. have mathematically described one possible 
transformation route from D surface (in the OBDD phase) into G surface (in OBDG phase) on the 
basis of a continuous homotopic transformation through the minimal surfaces,35 namely, the 
transformation from (6,4) net of D surface into (10,3) net of G surface can be achieved by 
“randomly pulling apart” a tetrahedral vertex to form two trigonal vertices. It is noted that pulling 
all vertices apart in one direction would result in Fddd-type (10,3) net structure. However, the 
possibility of Fddd structure has already been ruled out for the present diblock in conjunction with 
Figure 1b. 
Here we would like to further discuss the thermodynamic driving forces that control the 
formation of the OBDD and OBDG phases in response to the temperature change. The main 
difference between the elementary units of the two bicontinuous structures lies in the degree of 
packing frustration associated with the stretching of the minority block chains (i.e. sPP blocks in 
our diblock), where the minority block chains have to be stretched more to fill the space at the 
center of the four-connector (in the OBDD structure) than that of the three-connector (in the OBDG 
structure). On the other hand, the four-connector domain in OBDD has a lower surface area per unit 
volume than that of the three-connector in gyroid36 and should hence suffer a lower interfacial 
energy. Nevertheless, the enthalpy difference between surfaces “G” and “D” was calculated to be 
small when adopting an isometric mapping of minimal surface.37,38 Since the theoretical works 
normally assume the block chains to obey Gaussian statistics, the relief of the entropic penalty 
arising from packing frustration can easily outweigh the reduction of interfacial free energy; as a 
result, OBDG is always predicted to be a more stable structure than OBDD for the conventional 
diblock copolymers even in the case of the larger segregation strength (or at lower temperatures). 
 frustration regained its dominant role when the population of helical segments was low at 
sufficiently high temperature and thereby the OBDG phase became more stable structure. 
The issue for the relief of packing frustration that dominated the self-assembly at higher 
temperature of sPP-b-PS was further evidenced by blending with the corresponding constituent sPP 
homopolymer (see Figure S10 of the Supporting Information). It was found that the OBDD 
structure could also be formed in the sPP-b-PS/sPP blends. The OBDD-to-OBDG transition 
temperature of the blend was found to locate at ca. 10 ~ 20 oC higher than that of neat diblock as the 
homopolymer chains were able to be segregated to fill the space at the center of the connectors to 
release the packing frustration. This thereby enhanced the stability of OBDD phase. 
Let us now consider factor (2), i.e., the effect of the polydispersity of sPP (PDIs of sPP and PS 
blocks in our block copolymer are 1.32 and 1.02, respectively) on stabilization of OBDD. If the 
polydispersity is caused by a contamination with sPP homopolymer, the sPP homopolymer can 
stabilize the OBDD as elucidated immediately above. However, we can rule out this possibility of 
homopolymer contamination evidently from the symmetric GPC elution curve (see Figure S2 of the 
Supporting Information). Thus, we can focus on the issue whether the polydispersity of sPP-b-PS 
would stabilize the OBDD structure. Generally the polydispersity of block copolymers varies the 
interface curvature and thereby the morphology of the microdomain primarily via the so-called 
“cosurfactant effect”30 which is brought about by block chains having different chain lengths being 
packed in a given microdomain with their chemical junctions on the common interface. The effect 
was explored extensively for not only binary mixtures of diblock copolymers46 but also block 
copolymers with polydispersity31,46-48. However, to our best knowledge, these copolymer systems 
having essentially random-coil conformation and van der Waals interactions never showed the 
OBDD structures, that is, their ordered bicontinuous structure reported so far is the OBDG phase. 
Thus, even in the block copolymers with relatively high molecular weight polydispersity, OBDG is 
still a selected equilibrium morphology but not OBDD, as long as the block chains adopt random 
coiled conformation and have van der waals interactions only. 
 
Conclusions 
We have discovered that a slightly asymmetric sPP-b-PS as cast from xylene displayed the 
OBDD structure. When the OBDD-forming copolymer was heated, this structure transformed into 
the gyroid (OBDG) phase at ca. 155 oC. Interestingly, OBDG transformed back to OBDD upon 
cooling. The thermal reversibility of the transformation indicated that OBDD was a 
thermodynamically stable structure for this system. This was in contradiction to the previous 
theoretical works which predicted that OBDD is unstable relative to OBDG for neat diblocks 
irrespective of the segregation strength, whereas it may exist over a narrow window in the blend of 
A-b-B with homopolymer A. We propose that when the population of helical segments of sPP block 
in the melt was sufficiently high, their mutual interactions would allow sPP blocks to form locally

volume fraction of sPP = 0.46 is rather unique, which may be attributed to the cosurfactant 
effect30 or the polydispersity effect31. It is noted that a PS-b-poly(dimethylsiloxane) was found 
to exhibit OBDG structure at a rather symmetric volume fraction of 0.40-0.41.32

出席會議名稱：SAS 2009
會議期間：2009/9/13至 2009/9/18
計畫編號：NSC 97-2221-E-007 -034
零、前言
首先感謝國科會的補助，讓學生能參與 2009/9/13 至 2009/9/18 期間在英國
牛津大學舉辦的第 14屆 SAS會議。此會議是以“Smal-Angle Scatering”為主軸，
涵蓋各個領域，包括物理科學、材料科學及生物科學等，提供國際學者三年一次
的大型學術交流。此次會議吸引將近 1000名的相關學者及廠商的參與，因此 SAS
會議實屬國際上十足重要的研討會。
一、參加會議經過
學生於 9/11自台灣出發，參與9/13−9/18所舉辦之第十四屆國際小角度散射
會議行程為期 6天，9/21返國，全程共計 11天。該次研討會於英國牛津大學的
Examinations Schools會場舉辦，聚集了英國、德國、法國、美國、台、日、韓、
印度等各國散射界知名教授及研究生共襄盛舉。此屆主辦單位主要是由英國當地
所領隊及籌劃主辦，在研討會過中有不錯的互動及廣泛的學術交流。學生在此會
議中進行 poster發表，與各地學者分享及交流研究成果，亦在討論過程中得到了
很多不同層面的想法與啟發。
會議第一天下午五點前往會場進行註冊並取得此次會議議程表，當天晚上即
開始瀏覽此次會議涵蓋之主題及內容，以規劃未來五天將參與聆聽之場次。會議
第二天至第五天早上及下午大會各會安排一場主題演講，主要邀請在散射領域中
非常知名的學者來分享研究成果。其餘時間(早上九點五十到下午三點半)讓三個
不同 session 同時進行演說，從中可聽取各種相關領域的成果發表。會議共安排
約 102位師長及學生口頭報告演講，涉獵題目多元，包括生物技術、陶瓷材料、
軟物質科學、環境工程、高分子材料、表面/界面科學、鐵磁系統以及理論模擬
等主題。會議第一及第三天晚上舉行來自各國約 300 位學者海報論文之研究介
紹。學生在第一天晚上即進行海報的張貼及解說(題目為 Confined Crystallization
and Morphology of Melt-Segregated PLLA-b-PE and PLDA-b-PE Diblock
Copolymers)，其研究主要是探討當 PE 鏈段高分子在接上不結晶之 PLDA 與接
上會結晶之 PLLA等團連式共聚物(i.e. block copolymer)其結晶行為的差異。壁報
展示過程當中，學生有與許多學者進行學術上的討論，並在過程中得到很多有用
大約為 10 nm。在此研究中，作者改良了一般的熱台(i.e. Linkam hot stage)，使該
熱台可達 10000 oC/min的降溫速率，接著利用同步輻射的光源迅速擷取數據，進
而觀測在降溫過程中，nodule的形成及成長過程。(6) Putting Polymers in the Beam:
40 years of synchrotron small angle scattering (Anthony J. Ryan, UK) 該學者的演講
內容最令學生印象深刻，回顧了高分子領域從過去到當前的發展。除了使用小角
度 X 光散射，該學者還結合了很多不同的儀器 (i.e. calorimetry, rheometry,
spectroscopy etc.)來解析高分子的內部結構。當今唯有利用更多儀器來取得多方
面的實驗證據(e.g. different time or length scale)，才能得到更完善的結構資訊。
除了一系列精彩的 oral presentation，學生對於幾篇 poster presentation也深感
興趣: (1) The Effect of Polydispersity on the Self-Assembly of Diblock Copolymers
(C. Howell, UK) 該學者發現到 polydispersity對於團連式共聚物之型態扮演著相
當重要的角色。作者利用 controlled radical technique (i.e. ATRP 及 RAFT) 針對某
一鏈段合成出不同 polydispersity的樣品。結果發現，在 monodisperse melt時，
其熔融型態呈現層狀結構。當其中一個鏈段的 polydispersity 增加時，此時該鏈
段所形成之 microdomain的間距會被撐大。一旦當該鏈段的 polydispersity持續增
加，整個 interface的曲率(i.e. curvature)都會受到影響，進而使 microdomain的型
態由原本的層狀結構轉換到圓柱狀結構。(2) Study on hierarchical structure of
polyethylene under uniaxial stretch by using USAXS, SAXS and WAXS 該學者利用
in-situ超小角度散射、小角度散射以及廣角度繞射來探測 low density polyethylene
(i.e. LLDPE) 在拉伸過程中的結構變化。結果發現，分子量的不同會造成在拉伸
過程中伴隨著 heterogeneous或 homogeneous deformation的發生。
參與這次 SAS 2009研討會獲益良多，其中莫過於吸收其他領域方面知識。
另外，從這次會議中體悟到實驗數據系統性的重要，除了實驗上觀測到的結果，
若能藉由理論或數學式子做分析，便能使自己的研究更嚴謹及完整，亦可增加實
驗的可信度。此次會議內容包含廣泛，可吸收到不同領域的研究，並且在英文語
言溝通方面，也有很好的經驗。在壁報口頭解說部分，由於學生過去對於該方面
的經驗較少，因此對於臨場應答五花八門的問題以及如何解釋才能讓別人接受都
變成學生日後繼續深造的藍本。雖然學生無法在這次的研討會中爭取到 oral的機
會，但仍可藉由會議中聽取不同領域的佼佼者，看他們如何設計自己的專業研
究，以及由演講時所發問的問題，來幫助自己更瞭解各種演講的表達方式及技巧。
三、參觀活動
參觀英國的 Diamond以及 ISIS等國家同步輻射中心。此外，學生在會議結
束之際有熟悉牛津大學週遭的環境。Oxford大學共有 38個學院，每棟建築物都
非常的壯觀及典雅，各個學院內幾乎都有設立一個教堂，其中還有一個教堂是知
名哈利波特拍攝的場景，是個陶冶性情及培養文藝氣息的好地方。

報告內容應包括下列各項： 
一、參加會議經過 
2011 年 3 月 20 日早上搭乘日本航空的飛機到東京成田機場轉機, 雖然 3 月 11 日的日本東北
地震、海嘯與核災，成田機場內並沒有顯得特別的異樣，等待約兩小時的轉機時間，搭上美國航
空的班機，經過 12 小時的飛行時間，到達德州 DFW 國際機場，途中並遇到本校老師黃迪靖教授
與其學生也一起來參加，由於經費有限，到機場後我們租車到達我們 check in 的旅館，準備參加
明天的會議。 
第一天: 
大約 9 點半到達 DCC (Dallas Convention Center)，在報到之後, 我們到先規畫這幾天想要聽的
session，主要集中在 Polymer physics、Polymer brush 與 Polymer thin film 部分，並參觀世界各地
的儀器廠商及期刊出版社之聯合參展，下午我們針對 poster 的部分, 注意相關高分子領域的 post, 
與與會者進行深入探討, 其中包含軟凝體物理，團聯共聚物的自組裝, 及 Graphene 與 polymer 
mixing 的主題, 在與會過程中並遇到 Rachel A. Segalman 與 她目前任教於 MIT 的學生 Bradley D. 
Olsen, 進行短暫的交流。 
第二天: 
由於第二天的發表的相關主題，大部分與磁性物理及光電物理，下午最主要是到 surfaces, interfaces, 
and polymer thin films 這個 session,聽本實驗室碩士班畢業的學姐王世帆的演講，晚上則是參加由
中華民國物理學會主辦的”Taiwan Night”。 
三、建議 
此次會議參加人數眾多，發表的研究內容也相當豐富，建議大會可以提供較充分的電腦使用
場地，使與會者可以查詢到關於會議的訊息，另外由中華民國物理學會所舉辦的 Taiwan Night，
建議可以多加宣傳，讓大家可以共襄盛舉。 
 
四、攜回資料名稱及內容 
議程導覽手冊與口袋手冊各一本 
 
 
 
報告內容應包括下列各項： 
一、參加會議經過 
    3/21~3/23 期間，學生個人的主要活動是以聴取演講及參觀海報為主。其中，在 3/22 晚間，
則參加了由中華民國物理協會所舉辦的「Taiwan Night」。3/24 下午，則進行學生所發表之論文
口頭報告。3/25 上午仍以聴取演講為主，下午搭機回台灣。 
 
二、與會心得 
    首先，非常感謝國科會此次對於學生出席國際會議期間之經費補助，而得以順利前往參加。
    參加這次 2011 年美國物理協會所舉辨的 3月會議，是學生首次出席國際型研討會的經歷，
感受其規模之大，遠甚於以往在國內所參加的各項大大小小化工或高分子相關領域的年會。由於
研討會的主軸著重在物理會議上，因此所包含物理相關研究內容自然包羅萬象，除了可以見識到
與學生所學相關之高分子物理其目前在世界上最新的研究方向之外，更能有機會接觸到其它領域
之物理學上的最新發展潮流，著實令學生獲益匪淺。 
    出席此次會議的收獲主要來自兩方面，包括：(1)瀏覽會場設置的海報發表區時之學術交流，
及(2)在口頭報告時所獲取的經驗。首先，在瀏覽海報時，經常有機會和作者進行學術上想法的
交流，另外，作者通常是來自世界各地的學生，因此還可以分享到他們在其它國家的研究歷程，
進而從中學習到國外研究生在學術上的熱忱和態度。另一方面，學生在此次會議中是以「結晶-
非結晶型雙嵌段共聚物摻合體之結晶行為探討」為題目來投稿口頭論文報告，其內容主要有關藉
由摻合兩種不同的結晶-非結晶型雙嵌段共聚物 (聚苯乙烯-聚氧化乙烯共聚物和聚苯乙烯-聚左
乳酸共聚物摻合體)，在分子鏈的低移動性及侷限結晶之效應下，會嚴重改變聚左乳酸分子鏈段
的結晶動力學及其晶體的熱力學性質。因此我們提出在低溫結晶條件下，由於聚氧化乙烯分子鏈
的隨意插入聚左乳酸結晶體，而形成一種具有高度缺陷的晶體。當在口頭報告結束後的問答時
間，有位日本教授問到一個頗為重要的問題：「此種缺陷的晶體，它的詳細結晶結構如何？同時，
由於聚氧化乙烯分子鏈和聚左乳酸分子鏈不會共結晶，但聚氧化乙烯分子鏈在聚左乳酸晶體間的
隨意穿插為何不單純是一種相分離結晶行為，而要將它定義成具有高度缺陷的晶體？」首先，對
於第一個問題，相信若能解出這個晶體的詳細結構將會是一個很有趣的課題，但這部份的研究目
前我們仍然還在解析當中。對於第二個問題，我的回答是：「由於我們已經利用廣角度 X 光繞射
觀察到有一個特殊且分佈極寬的繞射峰，再者，也利用微分熱卡計量測到相對應的晶體熔化之熱
焓，且它的熔融溫度低於正常聚左乳酸晶體的熔融溫度，並高於正常聚氧化乙烯晶體的熔融溫
度。這些特殊現象在單純的相分離結晶中是觀察不到的，因而我們提出此種由聚氧化乙烯分子鏈
的隨意插入聚左乳酸結晶體，而形成一種具有高度缺陷的晶體的觀點。」 
    總而言之，在這次美國物理學會所舉辨的會議中，讓學生接觸到一場內容極為完整的研討
會，同時，還見識到許多國際知名傑出學者的研究成果，進而瞭解當前最新的研究方向。 
 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者省略) 
    略。 
 
四、建議 
    非常感謝國科會在經費上的補助，讓學生得以順利出國參加國際型的學術會議。此種大型的
國際研討會有助於國內學生開拓視野，提高競爭力。在未來，仍希望國科會對於國內研究生能夠
維持此項經費的補助。
