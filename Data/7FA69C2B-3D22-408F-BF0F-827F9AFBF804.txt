1. Introduction 
Since portable digital audio players (ex. iPod, iPhone, and iPad) become more and more 
popular, the essential of digital music also becomes urgent. It brings on the applications of 
music database in great demand. The related researches consist of music classification, music 
feature extraction, music indexing, approximate music searching, and etc. which are all used 
for users to easily and efficiently search the music target in a music database 
(Anagnostopoulou, 1997, Blackburn, 1998, Christanti, 2011, Fu, 2011, Liu, 1999, Lo, 2008, 
2009, Mandel, 2008). Among them, there have been many studies for music feature 
extraction, indexing, and approximate searching. However, the existing approaches on music 
content for classification are rare. Recent years, the Sony Ericsson launched phones with 
SensMe function, such as the model numbers - W508, W902, W910, and W918, which is a 
proprietary music mood and tempo detection system. SensMe works by mapping music to a 
dual axis map based on the mood and tempo of music tracks such that music needs to be 
categorized for mapping. The music classification techniques can be discriminated into two 
categories - based by music feature classification (Brecheisen, 2006, Lin, 2004) and training 
by learning machine classification (Cheng, 2008, Deepa, 2011, Loh, 2006, Mandel, 2008). 
Both have it advantages and disadvantages. However, most of these approaches are based on 
single music feature, such as melody or chord, and the classification of accuracy is up to 70% 
in few genres of music and is lower in most music genres. In this paper, we will study the 
music contents to find the significant features for music in the same music genre such that we 
can develop multi-feature approach for more accuracy music classification.  
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we brief review the 
existing music classification techniques. After that, we propose our multi-feature music 
classification scheme in section 3. Then, we show our experimental results in section 4. 
Finally, a conclusion is given in the last section. 
 
2. Related Works 
In recent years, automatic classification of music data can be discriminated into two 
categories. One is based on analysis of music content for classification, such as SRP-Based 
Classification by Lin et al (2004) and Hierarchical Genre Classification by Brecheisen et al 
(2006). The other category is the application of training by learning machines in which naive 
Bayesian, linear and neural network are employed to build classifiers for styles, such as 
Extreme Learning Machine by Loh et al (2006), Multiple-Instance Learning by Mandel et al 
(2008), Automatic Chord Recognition by Cheng et al (2008), and Optimized Feature Vector 
by Deepa et al (2011). The brief introductions for these schemes are as follows. 
2.1 SRP-Based Classification 
Lin et al (2004) use Significant Repeating Patterns (SRP) for music classification. The 
melodic sequence and rhythmic sequence are used as representations of music in the scheme. 
Yu-lung Lo and Yi-chang Lin 
International Conference on Innovation and Management, Republic of Palau, July 15-18, 2012. 
2.4 Multiple-Instance Learning  
Multiple-instance learning algorithms train classifiers from lightly supervised data. In 
Mandel et al (2008), they compared the multiple-instance learner mi-SVM algorithm 
(Andrews, 2003) and Multiple-Instance Learning via Embedded Instance Selection 
(MILES)(Chen, 2006), on the task of classifying 10 second song clips. These classifiers are 
trained on tags at the track, album, and artist levels, or granularities. The authors formulated a 
number of music information related multiple-instance learning tasks and evaluated the 
mi-SVM and MILES algorithms on them. They found that mi-SVM was the most accurate in 
recovering tags in training set, followed by the naïve approach of assuming bag tags applied 
to all instances, and then MILES. 
2.5 Chord Recognition 
A chord recognition system was proposed by Cheng et al (2008). This system 
incorporates the N-gram model and the hidden Markov model framework (Huang, 2001). 
This approach consists of training phase and testing phase. In the training phase, the N-gram 
model is trained on ground-truth chord transcriptions to learn the common rules of chord 
progression. In the testing phase, the chord sequence is decoded from the input audio and the 
chord with maximum likelihood is estimated using the pre-trained models. There also two 
proposed new chord features, longest common chord subsequence and chord histogram, are 
useful for music analysis, management, and retrieval. 
2.6 Optimized Feature Vector 
An optimized feature vector for music genre classification was proposed by Deepa et al 
(2011). There are three main steps in this scheme -- feature extraction, feature optimization, 
and SVM (Support Vector Machine) Classifier. At first, each music file is divided into frames 
of 23ms duration with 50% overlap and the features are extracted. After feature extraction, 
some particular values of the features are selected to form the feature vector. These feature 
vectors are optimized to generate the final feature vector and the classifier is trained based on 
Support Vector Machine with that feature vector. Then the classifier creates a model of the 
trained data.  
The existing approaches are either with fair accuracy or needed extra training in order to 
obtaining classification information. In this paper, we would like to propose a content-based 
multi-feature music classification scheme to improve the accuracy. 
 
3. Content-based Multi-Feature Music Classifications 
In this research, we investigate the music content and try to find the significant features 
for a genre to improve the accuracy of music classification. Our approach analyses the music 
content, such as notes, rhythms, and pitch changes, as features for individual genre (ex: 
classical, pop, folk and jazz). The dense analysis and rare analysis are used to examine the n 
highest occurrences and the n lowest occurrences, respectively, for a music feature by 
Yu-lung Lo and Yi-chang Lin 
International Conference on Innovation and Management, Republic of Palau, July 15-18, 2012. 
notes, rhythms, and pitch changes as the music content features is created for experiment. 
There are classical, folk, pop and jazz four music genres in our database. Each music genre 
has 150 real music, therefore, there are 600 real music in total in database. To start 
experiment, we first analyse the occurrence frequencies of notes, rhythms, and pitch changes 
of music data by sampling 10% from our database. After that the centers of features for each 
music genre can be created. For example, the Figure 1 presents the 22 highest occurrence 
notes and their frequencies for classical music by 10% sampling from database. The 
frequencies of the 5 highest occurrence notes which are high Do, high Re, Si, high Mi, and 
La are also shown in Table 1. The centre coordinate of classical music for note is (0.0853, 
0.0814, 0.0772, 0.0754, 0.0744). With this centre coordinate, we can use these 5 highest 
occurrence notes of each music in database to examine the most likely music genre to belong to 
by the equation (1) if there is only one feature used for classification.

2 High Re 0.0814 
3  Si 0.0772 
4 High Mi 0.0754 
5  La 0.0744 
 
After that the equation (2) are applied for categorizing the music in database by 
multi-feature classification. The number of the highest occurrences (n) for the centre 
coordinate of a music genre is varied from 3 to 7 in our experiment. For the weight wi in 
equation (1), the higher occurrence of a feature will have the lower weight value in our 
experiment. In dense analysis, wi is equal to i for the ith highest occurrence of a feature. In 
contrast, in rare analysis, wi is equal to (n-i+1) for the ith lowest occurrence of a feature. We 
explored the combination of 2 to 3 music content features (k) to examine the accuracy of

4.2 Effect of Rare Analysis for Multi-Feature Music Classification 
We study the effect of rare analysis for multi-feature music classification in this section. 
The experimental environment and parameter setting are the same as in Section 4.1 except 
that rare analysis chooses the lowest occurrences of every music content feature for music 
classification. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3. 
Unlink in dense analysis, pop music and folk music can be classified better in rare 
analysis for music classification. From Figure 3 (a), we find that the classification accuracy of 
pop music is rising as increasing the number of the lowest occurrences of notes and rhythms. 
The accuracy can be up to 87% when the number of the lowest occurrences reaches 7. In 
additions, pop music is classified well by using rhythms combining with pitch changes and 
all three features combining together as demonstrating in Figure 3 (c) and (d). The curves of 
pop music have the similar behavior in Figure 3 (a), (c), and (d). The folk music also has 
better classification accuracy by combining notes and pitch changes. The accuracy is reduced 
as increasing the number of the lowest occurrences and is up to 85% when the number of 
lowest occurrences is 3. Furthermore, the classification accuracy of classical music is worse 
than it in dense analysis by combining notes and pitch changes, and jazz music also performs 
very poor in rare analysis.

以內容擷取(content-based retrieval)之音樂資料庫的應用，已受到廣
泛的關注。但所萃取出並儲存之音樂內容或音樂特徵，除了用於音樂資料
之查詢比對外，尚未見到使用於各類音樂資料共通特徵之分析與研究。本
研究計畫透過對音樂資料多特徵之分析與歸納，找出每一類音樂所獨有之
共通點，據以發展出音樂資料之分類機制。 此外，數位音樂播放器的流
行，除了隨身聽外，亦促使人手一機的行動電話也加入了數位音樂播放的
功能，且更進一步的發展出心情手機，可隨使用者的心情來選擇播放不同
類型的音樂。然而現有音樂播放器中之音樂分類，仍採人工方式進行，自
動音樂分類遂有其實際應用的迫切性。而目前已發表之音樂分類技術，多
數需要訓練學習階段或少部份類型音樂之自動分類，精確度可達 70%左
右，而其他類型之分類則是有更低的精確度。如此，本研究計畫提出新的
技術，讓音樂分類之精確度可更加的提升，以讓音樂自動分類，於我們的
生活中更為人性話與實用可行。

二、 與會心得 
我 們 所 發 表 的 論 文 標 題 為 ─ 「 Content-Based Multi-Feature Music 
Classification」，是以音符(notes)、節拍(rhythms)、以及前後音差(pitch changes)之
音樂內容特徵為基礎，做稠密度分析(dense analysis)與稀疏分析(rare analysis)，各
特徵找出前幾個重要內容，用來對 classical、pop、folk 與 jazz 的音樂做分類，其
分類的精確度高於現有之技術。由於市場上已有心情手機，可以偵測使用者的當
下心情，我們所發展的音樂分類技術，恰可應用於音樂推薦系統上，依使用者的
心情可自動的推薦適當類型的音樂。 
會議中所發表之論文來自 12 個國家，是個很好的國際交流與開擴視野之機
會。且由於是創新與管理為主題的研討會，會議過程中遇到許多中華民國資訊管
理學會之理監事等之資管領域先進前輩，多了與他們接觸與學習的機會。 
 
三、 考察參觀活動(無是項活動者省略) 
帛琉是我們國家的邦交國之一，人口之有一萬多人，會議之餘，參觀了帛琉的
國家博物館，是由我們政府捐資 250萬美金所興建而成的。而於許多進行中的道
路修建，都可以看見中華民國國旗與帛琉國旗展示在一起，表示也是由台灣所捐
資興建。令人深刻體會，台灣的外交困境，對邦交國給予難以估計的協助。 
 
四、 建議 
可能會議所在之飯店沒有足夠大的餐廳，以至於此國際研討會沒有舉辦晚宴，
少了一次讓所有與會專家學者齊聚一堂社交互動的機會，殊為可惜。

Abstract 
The music classification techniques can be discriminated into two categories — based by 
music feature classification and training by learning machine classification. Both have their 
advantages and disadvantages. For music feature classifications, most of the existing 
approaches are based on single music feature, such as melody or chord, and the accuracy is 
about 70% in a couple of genres of music. However, the accuracy for classification of most 
music genres is lower. In this paper, we study the music contents and propose the 
multi-feature classification approach for categorizing music more accuracy. Our performance 
study shown that up to 87%, 85%, 83%, and 73% of pop, folk, classical, and jazz music can 
be classified correctly, respectively, by using multi-feature of music content for classification.

Abstract 
Recent years, the Cloud computing technologies have become more and more important for many 
existing database applications. The Cloud platform provides an ease to use interface between providers 
and users, allow providers to develop and provide software and databases for users over locations. 
Currently, there are many Cloud platform providers support large-scale database services. However, most 
of these Cloud platform architectures only support simple keyword- based queries and can’t response 
complex query efficiently due to lack of efficient in multi-attribute index techniques. Existing Cloud 
platform providers seek to improve performance of indexing techniques for complex queries. In this paper, 
we evaluate the existing multi-attribute indexing structures for Cloud platform. We conclude our 
experimental results to suggest the more efficient and scalable multi-attribute index structure for Cloud 
platform.
