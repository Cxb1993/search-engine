本研究主要在理論上及測量技術上改善現存的微波頻率之介電性質之測量技術，發
展出新的、更方便、更為簡單而且準確之測量微波介電性質(介電常數及介電損耗)的方法。 
目前已發表之微波介電性質之測量方法不下二、三十種，本計畫將以其中之
Distributed Transmission Techniques為研究之重點，經由量測微波通過樣品時之傳輸參數
(S21, S12)及反射參數(S11, S22)，計算出樣品之微波介電性質。採用此方法作為研究主
題之主要原因為，首先，與現存所有技術中，目前廣泛使用之微波共振技術做比較，共
振技術往往具有只能做單一頻率點量測之缺點，而 Distributed Transmission Techniques則
具有頻率掃瞄之能力，為此技術之最主要優勢。再者，Distributed Transmission Techniques

（二）計畫英文摘要。 
Keywords： Transmission coefficient, Reflection coefficient, Dielectric properties, Microwave 
measurements. 
 
This research is dedicated to study theoretical and technical areas of microwave dielectric 
properties measurement techniques, to improve the existing techniques, and to develop new 
methods with the characteristics of simple, convenient, and accurate for the dielectric properties 
(dielectric constant and loss tangent) measurements in microwave frequencies. 
More than twenty microwave dielectric measurement techniques have been published. 
One kind of these techniques – Distributed Transmission Techniques, will be studied in our 
research. By measuring the transmission coefficient (S21, S12) and reflection coefficient (S11, 
S22) of the sample, the microwave dielectric properties can be calculated. The main reason of 
studying this technique is because of the advantage of frequency swept capability. Unlike the 
widely used microwave Resonance Techniques, only single frequency point can be measured. 
In addition, the measurement setup of the Distributed Transmission Techniques is very simple. 
This research will dedicate to solve the dimension resonance problem of the most widely used 
Distributed Transmission Techniques – S21 & S11 Transmission and Reflection Technique.

Abstract — A low loss measurement technique for complex 
permittivity, using a closed cylindrical cavity resonator, is 
investigated.  The measurements are made at the resonant 
frequency of the TE01δ mode with a new modified field model, 
which provides a very simple and clear description of the field 
distribution within the resonator. The various aspects of the 
conductor loss are studied. The perturbation methods and their 
accuracies for calculating the conductor loss and the energy 
factor are compared with the traditional calculation methods. 
The improvement of the modified field model to the unmodified 
is justified by experimental results on dielectric constant 
measurements. 
 
Index Terms — Dielectric resonators, cavity resonators, dielectric 
measurements, permittivity measurement. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The closed cylindrical cavity dielectric resonator in Figure 
1 has been adopted for microwave dielectric properties 
(relative complex permittivity, "' εεε jr −= ) measurements, 
with the TE01δ mode generally being the mode that is studied. 
By putting the dielectric rod sample inside a closed cavity can 
completely eliminated the effect of field radiation. Several 
different theoretical and experimental analyses have been 
reported in the literatures [1-9]. Accurate prediction of 
resonant frequency was given in their papers. However, the 
field expressions or theoretical analyses are usually quite 
complicated. Various simplified models have also been 
published [10-13]. Those simplified models usually suffer 
from the problem of lower accuracy for the descriptions of the 
configurations of the electromagnetic fields. 
A modified field model that is very simple and gives 
accurate measurements of microwave dielectric properties has 
been proposed by reference [14]. This model was obtained by 
modifying the Itoh and Rudokas model [10-13], which has the 
great advantage of dealing with very simple field expressions. 
In [14], an eigenvalue equation was derived from the modified 
field model for the calculation of the real part of permittivity. 
Measurement of loss tangent ( '/"tan εεδ = ) was also 
conducted and reasonable accuracy was obtained. However, 
some very important issues have not been investigated yet and 
will be studied in this paper. 
 
 
 
Fig. 1  Side view of the cylindrical cavity dielectric resonance technique. 
 
Firstly, comparison of the modified model and the 
unmodified Itoh and Rudokas model will be useful to 
understand how much improvement of the modified model 
has been accomplished. Dielectric constants calculated from 
the unmodified model are compared with the results from the 
modified one. In addition, conductor loss is a very important 
factor for the measurement of loss tangent. For  the 
computation method of conductor loss, a simple perturbation 
method has been published. The accuracy of this method 
should be clarified. Conductor losses calculated by two 
different methods are investigated by this modified model. 
Finally, the conductor loss comes from the sidewall and the 
top and bottom plates. It is also interesting to understand 
where the main contribution of conductor loss is from.  The 
losses due to the sidewall and the top and bottom plates are 
compared. A detailed study of the above three important 
issues with the modified model, while necessary, is lacking in 
the previous article. In this paper, a further study of the

IV.   CALCULATIONS OF cQ  
The accurate computation of cQ , from equation (3), is very 
important for loss tangent measurement. It is well known that 
the Q  factor due to the conducting loss can be calculated by, 
 
c
e
c P
W
Q
ω2
=  (4a) 
ade WWW +=  (4b) 
 
where cP  and eW  are the power lost in the conductor and the 
total stored energy and dW  and aW  are the energies stored in 
the dielectric and the surrounding regions, respectively. The 
conductor loss comes from both the two plates and the 
sidewall as shown in Figure 2. From Figure 2, it is obvious 
that the condictor loss of the two plates is much larger than 
that of the sidewall for 3/ >ab . The loss due to the sidewall 
can then be neglected. 
With the loss of sidewall neglected, a perturbation theory 
can also beadopted to compute cQ  by the following equation 
[19,20], 
 
co
o
c
M
f
f
Q δ
δ
δ−=  (5) 
 
where a frequency shift ( ofδ ) is caused by a small change in 
the sample/plates distance ( Mδ ) for MLL == 21 . The cδ  is 
the skin depth of the metal shields. The advantage of this 
perturbation method is that it does not need to deal with the 
complicated field expressions to calculate cP  and eW  as does 
equation (4). One disadvantage is the requirement of accurate 
prediction of the frequency shift due to the distance change. 
The other is the neglecting of sidewall loss can be incorrect 
for small ab /  value. Figure 3 gives the comparison of 
equations (4) and (5). With larger distance between the sample 
and metal plates, the larger error by equation (5) means that 
the accuracy of calculated frequencies decreases as the 
sample/plates distance is increased. From the relation of 
dQ (= δtan/1 ), cQ , and uQ  in equation (3), for low loss 
tangent materials, calculation error by the perturbation method 
on cQ  should be treated carefully.It should be noted that the 
conducting loss will increase with the increasing LD /  ratio 
because of the increasing surface area of the sample cross 
section.
