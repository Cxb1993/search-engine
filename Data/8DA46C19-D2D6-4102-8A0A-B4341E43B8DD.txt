Abstract 
Analyses of solar cell light-collecting rate with 
high polymer reflecting gratings and 
experimental accomplishment of periodical 
gratings on the solar cell surface are studied. It 
mainly discusses about the way and advantage to 
enhance the solar cell efficiency by using 
holographic interference lithography to produce 
high polymer reflecting gratings on the solar cell 
surface.  Based on the easy processing method, 
the theoretically calculated open-voltage ,VOC, 
can be raised from 2.62V to 3.62V, and the 
maximum voltage ,Vm, increases from 2.5V to 
3.5V for a standard commercial Si solar cell. 
From experiment, the power conversion 
efficiency for the solar cell is also enhanced 
from 27% to 35.67%, corresponding to the 
increase of relative efficiency up to 32.1%. The 
theoretical analysis is in good agreement with 
the experimental findings. 
1. Introduction 
One of the major drawback in the solar cell is 
the low efficiency question. To solve the 
efficiency improvement problem, there is two 
methods as followings: Firstly, the silicon uses 
the passivated emitter rear locally-diffused 
(PERL) structure which has inverted pyramids on 
the top that are formed by using anisotropic 
etching to expose the slowly etching 
crystallographic planes. The pyramids reduce 
reflections of light incident on top surface, since 
light incident perpendicularly to the cell will 
strike one of the incident plans obliquely, and 
will be refracted obliquely into the cell. The rear 
contact is separated from the silicon by an 
intervening oxide layer. This gives much better 
rear reflection than an aluminum layer. To date, 
the PERL cell shows the highest conversion 
efficiency of 24% [1]. Second, sunlight can be 
focused by using external optical mirrors and 
lenses. Optical concentration offers an attractive 
and flexible approach to reducing high cell costs 
by substituting a concentrator area for much of 
the cell area. It also offers other advantages, such 
as a 20% increase in efficiency for a 
concentration of 1000 suns (an intensity of 
963KW/m2) [2]. 
Generally, Si is the main substrate material to 
fabricate the solar cells. But, the reflective ratio 
of Si surface is as high as 30~35% under light 
illumination [3]. If we can reduce the percentage 
of the reflected light, then we can hence raise the 
efficiency of solar cell.  In this study, we 
produce a layer of high polymer reflecting 
grating on the top of solar cell surface, due to the 
intrinsic of reflecting light, it will flash back the 
light which is reflected by the solar cell surface. 
Thus, we can enhance the light-collecting rate of 
solar cell and increase power conversion 
efficiency.  The key point in solar cell 
development is the promotion of efficiency.  
Therefore, how to use the easiest and cheapest 
method to enhance the efficiency is the first topic.  
In this research, we match up micro electricity 
process, optics interferences and use polymer 
reflecting gratings to flash back the light which is

and the power of 60mW is used. The laser beam 
is divided into two same beams by beam splitter. 
These two waves travel on the cross direction 
and meanwhile they interfere with each other 
and form the pattern of reflecting grating on the 
sample. The relation between diffractive grating 
period T and the incident angle of light 
1 and 2  is given in equation 1. T is grating 
period, 1 、 2 and  are incident angles of 
light,   is the laser wavelength, respectively.

Step 2: To reprint the gratings on the solar 
cell substrate. We use high polymer (Poly 
dimethyl siloxane, PDMS) to reprint. We spin 
thin film of PDMS on the photo-resist substrate 
which has the sensibility of diffractive grating.  
Because of the characteristic of PDMS, we can 
easily separate them. After separation, the stripe 
pattern of grating is transmitted on PDMS thin 
film.  And we can also transmit the patter from 
DMS thin film into high polymer substrate.  
First, we take PDMS thin film and put it on glass 
substrate, and then, we put two boards on each 
side of the substrate. Next, we place a glass 
substrate over it.  After these steps, PDMS thin 
film is placed between two glass substrates, and 
there will be a revealed interval inside.  After 
that, we fill OG into the middle of the two 
glasses, and then OG will adhere on the model.  
OG is a sensitive polymer material, the UV light 
is then applied to solidify it.  At last, the 
reflecting gratings are produced on the solar cell 
substrate.  The total processing procedures is 
schematically shown in the figure 5.

gratings to reprint on the solar cell

The simulation of the solar cell with gratings 
is calculated as followings.

with high polymer reflecting diffractive-mode 
gratings and the other without gratings.  The 
calculation between two type of solar cells 
including the short-circuit current (Isc), 
open-circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion 
efficiency (η) are discussed. During the 
experiment, a commercial Si-based solar cell is 
used to form the gratings on its surface and its 
specification is listed in Table I.  First, the figure 
6 is the result of AFM measurement in 
fabricating the surface gratings. [6] In figure 6, 
the grating period of 0.5μm and depth of 
184.61nm in the OG polymer condition can be 
seen.  From experiment, it is found that the 
periods in the photo-resist and OG polymer 
conditions are 0.52μm and 0.5μm, respectively. 
But, the depths in the photo-resist and OG 
polymer conditions are 212.24nm and 184.61nm, 
respectively. The resulted minor deviation and 
decrease in dimension is mainly due to the 
PDMS residual during reprint process from 
photo-resist into OG polymer process. [7] In 
addition, the reflection ratios of 0.14 and 0.06 for 
the independent solar cell surface and polymer 
gratings are measured by PL Spectrometer. It 
implies that the reflection ratio r1 is 0.14 and the 
reflection ratio r2 is 0.06 in this research, 
respectively.  
 
Figure 6. Surface reflecting gratings under AFM 
measurement 
When the parameter data listed in table I are put 
into equation (2) to (14) and set the solar cell 
reflection ratio constant r1= 0.14 , then the 
relation of  Isc , Voc , η vs. r2 can be plotted by 
MATLAB software.  
 
Table I  The specification of the commercial Si 
solar cell used in this study 
The reflection ratio r2 acts as a parameter 
which is dependent on the grating depth and 
width. The relation of Isc vs. r2 is shown in figure 
7. It is found that Isc increases with increasing r2 
and the value is 109.1mA while r2 is equal to the 
grating reflection ratio of 0.06. This value is 
almost unchanged compared with that in r2=0. 
The range of calculated Isc is just varied from 
109.1mA to 110.1mA.   On the other hand, 
figure 8 shows the relation of Voc vs. r2 and the 
Voc also increases with the increase of r2. From 
figure 8, it is found that the Voc is rapidly 
increased from r2=0 to 0.1 but gradually 
approaches 3.67V. At the point (Voc, 
r2)=(3.618,0.06), it represents the open-circuit 
voltage is equal to 3.618V after coating surface 
gratings on the solar cell. The range of 
calculated Voc is varied from 2.62V to 3.67V. 
Finally, the relation of η vs. r2 is shown in figure 
9. It is worth to note that the rapidly increased 
trend of power conversion efficiency is the same 
with that of Voc at r2=0 to 0.1. When increasing 
the grating ratio (r2), the power conversion 
efficiency (η) will approach 39%. The calculated 
maximum variation predicted in power 
to develop a high-efficiency solar cell is possible 
in the future.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The major drawback in the solar cell is the low efficiency 
question. Efficiency improvement has two methods: Firstly, the 
silicon is passivated by emitter rear locally-diffused (PERL) 
structure which has inverted pyramids on the top that are 
formed by using anisotropic etching to expose the slowly 
etching crystallographic planes. The pyramids reduce 
reflections of light incident on top surface, since light incident 
perpendicularly to the cell will strike one of the incident plans 
obliquely, and will be refracted obliquely into the cell. The rear 
contact is separated from the silicon by an intervening oxide 
layer. This gives much better rear reflection than an aluminum 
layer. To date, the PERL cell shows the highest conversion 
efficiency of 24% [1]. Second, sunlight can be focused by 
using mirrors and lenses. Optical concentration offers an 
attractive and flexible approach to reducing high cell costs by 
substituting a concentrator area for much of the cell area. It 
also offers other advantages, such as a 20% increase in 
efficiency for a concentration of 1000 suns (an intensity of 
963103W/m2) [2].   
In general, Si is the main material to fabricate the solar 
cells.  And the reflective rate of Si surface is 30~35% under 
light. [3] If we can reduce the percentage of light reflected, 
then we can raise the efficiency of solar cell.  In this research, 
we use a layer of high polymer reflecting polymer grating on 
the top of solar cell substrate, because of the character of 
reflecting light, it will flash back the light which is reflected by 
the solar cell substrate. So, we can enhance the light-collecting 
rate of solar cell and increase power transfer to efficiency.  
Because the main point of solar cell development is the 
promotion of efficiency, therefore, how to use the easiest and 
cheapest way to enhance the efficiency is the key point.  In this 
study, micro electricity process and optics interferences are 
used. We use reflecting gratings to flash back the light which is 
reflected by solar cell substrate, so we can use the light 
repeatedly and raise the light-collecting rate.  Surely, the 
efficiency of solar cell will be increased. Figure 1 is structure 
diagram and the Figure 2 illustrates working theorem. The r1
in the Fig. 2 is reflecting ratio of solar cell and r2 is reflecting 
ratio of high polymer reflecting grating.

Nowadays, there are many researches discussing about 
enhancing solar cell efficiency, and we divide them into two 
ways: (1) changing the elements of solar cell (2) concentration 
light solar cell. In this research, we make a layer of reflecting 
grating on the solar cell substrate.  By this way, we do not need 
to change anything of the solar cell elements but use the 
character of reflection to collect more light which is reflected

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We have successfully fabricated the new solar cell structure 
with surface gratings to enhance its light-collecting rate. In 
experimental process, the conventional lithographic method is 
combined with holographic interferometry technology to form 
the polymer gratings, simultaneously. In comparison with two 
kinds of solar cells, i.e., one with high polymer reflecting 
gratings [6-7] and the other without gratings.  We calculate the 
short circuit current, open voltage and energy conversion 
efficiency. After we get the calculated data, we are going to 
analyze the statistic trends. A standard Si-based solar cell with 
Voc=2.62V, Isc=109.1mA, Vm=2.5V, Im=108mA, FF=94%,ӯ
=27% is used to simulate the calculation. The average 
reflection rate r1 and r2 are measured by PL reflection 
measurement and are equal to 0.14, 0.06, respectively. Then, 
the figure 5 is reflecting ratio of grating r2 vs. Isc illustration. 
Figure 6 is reflecting ratio of grating r2 vs. Voc illustration. 
Figure 7 is reflecting ratio of grating r2 vs. power conversion 
efficiency diagram of curves. From figure 7, the approaching 
power conversion efficiency of 37.91% for a solar cell with 
polymer gratings is then predicted.
