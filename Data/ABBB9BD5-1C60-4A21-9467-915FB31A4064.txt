expresses the local dynamics of each fuzzy 
rule. Then, the overall fuzzy model is achieved 
by blending these rules. The advantage of 
controller synthesis for such a fuzzy model is 
that the linear control methods can be used. 
There are many successful applications of the 
TS fuzzy model approach to the nonlinear 
control systems (see, Babuska, 1998; 
Farinwata et al., 2000; Tanaka and Wang, 
2001; Tong et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Xiu 
and Ren, 2005; Lian et al., 2006; Fang et al., 
2006; Ho et al., 2007; Razavi-Panah and Majd, 
2008; Lendek, et al., 2010). In practice, not all 
the state variables are accessible for control of 
dynamic systems. On the issue of choosing 
accessible measurements for feedback control 
of dynamic systems, the static output feedback 
control strategy would be the best choice 
because it is simple in controller structure 
(compared with the dynamic output feedback 
controller and the observer-based state 
feedback controller) and it is able to use the 
easily measureable variables as feedback 
signals to realize the control systems. 
Therefore, some researchers (Chang et al., 
2003; Gong et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; 
Fang et al., 2006 ; Huang and Nguang, 2006, 
2007 ; Wu, 2008; Soliman et al., 2009 ; Chang 
et al., 2009 ; Du and Zhang, 2009 ; Lee and 
Kim, 2009 ; Qiu et al., 2010 ; Chen et al., 
2010 ; Jabri et al., 2010) have proposed some 
methods to design the static output feedback 
controllers of the TS fuzzy model systems.  
 2 
 
 
On the other hand, in control systems 
design, it is often of interest to synthesize a 
quadratic-optimal controller such that the 
control objective of minimizing a quadratic 
integral performance criterion is achieved 
(Friedland, 1986; Goodwin et al., 2001). 
However, the problem of designing a 
quadratic-optimal static output feedback 
controllers is essentially very hard for the TS 
fuzzy model systems and, thus, rarely studied 
in the literature (Wu, 2008). 
The purpose of this report is to propose 
an integrative numerical optimization method 
accompanied with the robust stabilizability 
condition to design the robust-stable and 
quadratic-finite-horizon-optimal static output 
feedback PDC controllers of the TS fuzzy 
model systems with elemental parametric 
uncertainties. The method integrates the 
orthogonal-functions approach (OFA), the 
hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) 
and the linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) 
technique, where the LMI technique is used to 
derive the robust stabilizability condition for 
ensuring that the closed-loop uncertain TS 
fuzzy model systems can be robustly 
stabilized. 
 
三、研究方法與成果 
Based on the approach of using the 
sector nonlinearity in the fuzzy model 
construction, both the fuzzy set of premise part 
and the linear dynamic model with parametric 
uncertainties of consequent part in the exact 
TS fuzzy control model with parametric 
uncertainties can be derived from the given 
nonlinear control model with parametric 
uncertainties (Tanaka and Wang, 2001; Ho et 
al., 2007). The TS fuzzy model system with 
parametric uncertainties for the nonlinear 
control system with parametric uncertainties 
can be obtained as the following form:

However, only robust stabilizability is 
often not enough in control design. The 
control objective of minimizing a quadratic 
finite-horizon integral performance criterion 
for the nominal dynamic systems is also 
considered in many practical control 
engineering applications (Friedland, 1986; 
Goodwin et al., 2001). On the other hand, 
before we are able to synthesize a controller 
such that the good control performance for a 
given dynamic system can be efficiently 
achieved, it is necessary that the given 
dynamic system can be stabilized by the 
controller (Nise, 2000; Yu, 2002). In addition, 
both optimality and stability should be 
simultaneously considered in the optimal 
controllers design (Skelton, 1988). Therefore, 
the problem considered here is how to specify 
the local static output feedback gain matrices 
  of the static output 
feedback PDC controller in Eq. (5) such that 
the constraint of LMI-based robust 
stabilizability condition in Eq. (8) for the 
closed-loop uncertain TS fuzzy model system 
in Eq. (6) can be satisfied, and such that the 
optimal control performance for the nominal 
TS fuzzy model system

is chosen for the independent variable t, 
ft
q  is 
a positive integer specified by the designer, Q 
is a symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix, 
and R is a symmetric positive-definite matrix. 
Here the time interval of interest is designated 
as being from 0=t  to ,ftqt =  where 0=t  
is the initial time and ftqt =  is the final time 
of the control period.  
The problem to be studied here can be 
named the mixed H2/LMI static output 
feedback PDC controllers design problem of 
the uncertain TS fuzzy model systems, and the 
design procedures for the static output 
feedback PDC controllers can be described as 
following: 
Step 1: Check the constraint of 
LMI-based robust 
stabilizability condition in Eq. 
(8). 
Step 2: Minimize the H2 quadratic 
finite-horizon integral 
performance index in Eq. (15) 
for the nominal TS fuzzy model 
system in Eqs. (13) and (14). 
That is, the design problem of the mixed 
H2/LMI static output feedback PDC 
controllers for the uncertain TS fuzzy model 
systems is a constrained dynamic optimization 
problem. We will integrate the OFA, the 
HTGA and the presented LMI-based robust 
stabilizability condition to solve the mixed 
H2/LMI static output feedback PDC 
controllers design problem of the uncertain TS 
fuzzy model systems, where the performance 
index subject to the constraint of robust 
stabilizability condition is considered to be 
directly minimized. 
Here, consider the time interval

by using the OFA and the LMI-based robust 
stabilizability condition, the robust-stable and 
quadratic-finite-horizon-optimal static output 
feedback PDC control problem for the 
uncertain TS fuzzy model systems can be 
replaced by a static constrained-optimization 
problem represented by the algebraic 
equations with constraints; thus greatly 
simplifying the robust-stable and 
quadratic-finite-horizon-optimal static output 
feedback PDC control problem. Then, the 
HTGA can be employed to search for the 
optimal solution of the static 
constrained-optimization problem in Eq. (26), 
where Eq. (26) is a nonlinear function with the 
continuous variables. The detailed steps of the 
HTGA can be found in the works of Tsai et al., 
(2004, 2006).

Abstract 
A Taguchi-based the differential evolution (TDE) is 
applied as an improved the differential evolution to 
solve the global optimization. The differential 
evolution (DE) is an easy and valid evolutionary 
algorithm for fitness function optimization. For grey 
forecasting model (GM) which is a time series 
forecasting model, the parameters are calculated by 
the TDE. The academic research of Wang and Hsu is a 
base of this paper. Finally, the forecasted result of 
TDEGM is superior to other evolutionary algorithms. 
 
Keywords ： Grey forecasting model; Evolution 
algorithm; Optimal 
1. Introduction 
Grey system theory is proposed by Deng[1].The 
past decades have seem growing importance placed on 
research in grey forecasting. The grey method has 
been widely used for the forecasting. The grey model 
is characterized by exceptionally high accuracy of 
predicted value with only a few data. Grey theory is 
widely applied in many applications. In this paper, a 
method using Taguchi-differential evolution algorithm 
(TDE) is presented to improve the accuracy of the 
original GM(1,1) model. The foundations of this 
research are grounded on the academic research of 
Wang and Hsu [2]. Furthermore, in this study, the 
outputs of the integrated circuit industry of Taiwan is 
used as our example to examine the model reliability 
and accuracy. According to the forecasting presented 
in this paper, Taguchi-differential evolution algorithm 
Grey method(1,1)(TDEGM(1,1)) seems to be the best 
method for forecasting integrated circuit industry of 
Taiwan. 
2. Methodology 
The Grey Method(1,1), proposed by Deng[1] , is 
an effective mathematical means to deal with systems 
forecasting characterized by deficient information. 
The GM(1,1) model is a time series model. 
 
The normal differential equation of 
GM(1,1)model is 
( ) ( ) ,)1(
)1(
btaX
dt
tdx
=+           (1) 
where t denotes the independent variables in the 
system , a represent the developed coefficient, b is the 
grey controlled variable, and a and b denote the   
parameters need to be determined in the model. The 
original data sequence denoted by 
)1()0(x , )2()0(x ,….and )()0( nx  are used to construct 
the grey forecasting model and accurately predict 
)........,2(),1( )0()0( ++ nxnx and ).()0( knx +  The 
original sequence is assumed herein to be as follows:          
percentage errors, over the sample period can 
be used to find out the most model level. 
Like the other cost function, for the MAPE 
lower values are better. The
t
y
∧
is the 
predicted value, and 
t
y  is the actual value. 
Step2: Select four-level of two-level of 
4321
,,, rrrr  in 
Eq.(9) by using roulette wheel approach, 
respectively. 
Step3: Select a suitable orthogonal array for matrix 
experiments.  
Step4: Calculate the values of perturbed vector 1V +G
i
 
of  n  experiments in the orthogonal array. 
Step5: One optimal chromosome, which is new 
perturbed vector 1V +G
i
, is generated based on 
the results from step3. 
Step6: Repeat Step1 through 4 until i = NP. This step 
will produce NP perturbed vectors. 
 
C. Crossover  
 
In order to increase the diversity of the new 
parameter vectors, crossover is introduced. Crossover 
is used to generate a trial vector 1G
jiU
+  by replacing 
the original population vector G
i
X  from the perturbed 
vector 1V +Gi . Each perturbed vector depending on the 
crossover rate 
rC to execute the crossover operation. 
If the perturbed vector 1V +G
i
 is determined to execute 
the crossover operation, the trial vector can be 
represented as

chosen integer from the interval [ ]1,0 −D . The integer 
L, which denotes the number of parameters that are 
going to be exchanged, is drawn from the interval 
[ ]D,1 . 
 
D. Selection 
 
The purpose of selection is retained better 
offspring. After crossover operation, the program 
would check that cost of each trial vector 1G
ji
U +  is 
compared with original population vector G
i
X . If the 
cost of original population vector G
i
X  is better than 
that of trial vector 1G
ji
U + , the original population vector 
G
i
X  is allowed to advance to the next generation. 
Otherwise, the new vector is replaced by the trial 
vector 1G
ji
U +  in the next generation. 
 
3.1. Empirical examples 
In this study, three grey models are presented to 
show that the TDEGM(1,1) can improve the precision 
of GM and overcome the restrictions of traditional 
models. The model is original GM(1,1) proposed by 
Deng[1]. The Bayesian GM(BGM) model is proposed 
by Wang and Hsu [2].The genetic algorithms-based 
GM(GAGM) model is propose by Wang and Hsu [2]. 
In this article, the Taiwan’s IC production value form 
1990 to 2001 was used in-sample data. There are 12 
observations. From 2002 to 2005 is the forecasting 
data by TDEGM(1,1).
