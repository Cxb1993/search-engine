(BLUE)[2-5]因為易於實作而受到矚目及廣為應用。為了符合無線感測網路對功率或能量效益的要求，
幾乎所有的分散式最佳線性非偏估計法都會為了達到最好的估計精準度，而採用功率有效分配或是最
小化的相應機制[2-5]。在這些能量分配技術的開發中，基本上都會假設資料融合中心(FC)已知感測雜
訊變異度以及瞬時通道增益(CSI)。 
在現實的感測環境中，系統參數值的不確定性是無法避免的，例如隨著環境條件改變所造成的感測雜
訊強度的波動，或是感測器不正常的運作。因此，除了考量能量效能之外，具有抵抗系統參數值波動
的能力也是在設計分散式感測演算法時的重要需求。在現有文獻中，雖然已有很多針對在感測網路下
的分散式估計所作的研究[6]，然而，以最佳線性非偏估計法為法則所作的相關研究卻相當缺乏。因此，
在這篇論文中，我們針對使用放大轉發演算法的無線感測網路 [5]，[7] 提出一個強大分散式最佳線性
非偏估計法，此方法具備了抵抗感測雜訊功率不確定性的能力。首先，我們採用貝氏公式，並假設：
(1)感測雜訊變異度的分佈遵循[2-4]的方式；(2)衰減通道為瑞利分佈，其在感知通道分散式訊號處理設
計中，為一常用的假設[1]。根據感測雜訊變異度和衰減通道的分佈特性，我們可以計算平均均方誤差
（AMSE），而我們提出的方法的目標即為減少此平均均方誤差。接下來，這篇論文主要的技術貢獻總
結如下。 
（一）由於平均均方誤差在分析上較複雜，所以我們採用藉由平均已知的分佈所得到的平均均方誤差
倒數（ARMSE）作為評量成果的依據。值得注意的是，平均均方誤差和平均均方誤差倒數之間基本的
關係是可以從分析上去特徵化的。更明確地說，當給定目標平均均方誤差的失真不超過 ε，平均均方
誤差的下界即為平均均方誤差倒數的倒數；更重要地，平均均方誤差的上界即為平均均方誤差倒數的
倒數與 ε的和。如此一來，這提供了一個改善估計精準度的設計方式：最小化平均均方誤差倒數的倒
數，或者最大化平均均方誤差倒數。這即為我們設計強大分散式最佳線性非偏估計法的基本設計準則。 
（二）因為平均均方誤差倒數的公式難以推導，這促使我們設法推導一個相關的且可分析的平均均方
誤差下界，其為一複雜且不完整的伽瑪函數[7]。更進一步簡化分析，我們建立了一個重要的不等式，
它代表平均均方誤差倒數的下界值所可能座落的範圍。在這個不等式中，有一個很重要的發現是兩個
邊界值完全由簡單的高斯錯誤函數決定。因此從分析的角度而言，這比起對平均均方誤差倒數下界作
分析更佳。因此，相對於直接最大化平均均方誤差倒數或是平均均方誤差倒數的下界，我們選擇根據
這個函數來作最大化，進而推導出一個具封閉形式但亞最佳的感測功率分配法則。此方法在整體效能
上所呈現的優點將在電腦模擬的章節作更進一步的展示。 
 
研究方法 
 
在無線感測器網路的架構下，我們考慮 N 個感測器與資料融合中心合作來估計一個未知的定型參數
θ ∈ R。在第 i個感測器所觀測到的信號為 
              , 1i ix n i Nθ= + ≤ ≤                                (2.1) 
in ∈ R為零均值量測雜訊，其變異度為
2
in
σ 。如同[5]、[7]中的設置，我們假設每一個量測值 ix 在傳
送至資料融合中心的過程中，是透過放大轉發演算法分別經由 N 個平行的平緩衰減通道。於是，接收
端收到從第 i個感測器傳送的訊號，1 i N≤ ≤ ，可表示為 
                   ( ) ,i i i i i i i i i i i i i i iy h p x v h p n v h p h p n vθ θ= + = + + = + +                 (2.2) 
ih ∈ R、 ip 分別為第 i個感測器到接收端的通道增益與功率放大係數， iv ∈ R為零均值白雜訊，變異

因此，當給定瞬時 2
in
σ 和 ih ，我們也能以均方誤差倒數作為效能評估的指標；當均方誤差倒數愈大，估
計的準確度愈高。而從分析的觀點來看，由於均方誤差倒數沒有涉及”反運算”，所以均方誤差倒數
相較於均方誤差更易處理。在接下來我們會介紹，基於這樣的特性，在考慮功率分配問題時，使我們
能夠找到一個相關的平均效能分析公式以提升分析效率。總之，基於上述所提之理由，對於強大分散
性最佳線性非偏估計法的效能分析，我們將採用平均均方誤差倒數做為評量標準，式子如下：

準確度，因此在設計感測器功率分配系數時，目標是期望 D要越大越好。 
儘管上述提及的方法是非常直觀合理的設計方式，但平均均方誤差一般來說並不等於 1D−  (可經由傑森
不等式(Jensen’s inequality)來證明)。因此，一旦 D增大，平均均方誤差能否保持在一個小的值（小
至何種程度）仍是一個尚未被解答的基本問題。以下定理證明了 1D− 和實際的平均均方誤差的基本關係
(證明過程參考附錄):

定理 3.1明確肯定了 1D− 為平均均方誤差的下界，且上界無法超過 1D− 和容許誤差等級 ε的和。尤其當 ε
被限制為一個很小的值時，會產生非常好的估計品質，此時 1D− 可以近似為平均均方誤差。因此，使 1D−
盡可能小，或相當於使 D 盡量大，是簡化平均均方誤差的一個合理方法。

為了最大化平均均方誤差倒數，第一個可行的方式是找出(3.3)中 D 的分析式。然而，由於(3.3)式的
雙重積分較難處理，無法直接導出一個公式解。為了克服這個問題，一個簡單的處理方式是去尋找平

區間  [0 ]α，其中 0α > ，稱為整體不確定性參數；同樣地雜訊變異度臨界值 iδ 也是均勻分布在區間 [0 ]δ ，
其中 0δ > 代表最大額定值。當 5α = 且 1δ = ，在不同的傳送能量 P 之下，圖 1 針對(4.4)式所對應的
強大解與在(4.4)中設定 0iα = 之非強大解在平均均方誤差上所作的比較。從圖上可看出強大解的平均
均方誤差的確有所降低。同時，平均均方誤差也隨著傳送能量 P 升高而降低。這部分是相當直觀合理
的，因為較大的傳送能量可以增進在資料融合中心的整體訊號品質，進而改善整體估計的準確度；同
樣的現象可以在許多先前的研究中發現，如[5]。當 40P = 且 1δ = ，圖 2 描述了對於不同的整體不確
定性參數α其平均均方誤差的變化。圖中顯示出當系統功率固定時，平均均方誤差會隨著整體不確定
性參數α而增加。這部分並沒有超出預期，因為當整體不確定性參數α增加時，真實的雜訊變異度與
名義值之間的偏差也會增大，因此降低了整體估計的品質。

Performance Analysis of Energy Detection Based Spectrum Sensing with
Unknown Primary Signal Arrival Time
Jwo-Yuh Wu, Member, IEEE, Chih-Hsiang Wang, and Tsang-Yi Wang, Member, IEEE
Abstract—Spectrum sensing in next-generation wireless cog-
nitive systems, such as overlay femtocell networks, is typically
subject to timing misalignment between the primary transmitter
and the secondary receiver. In this paper, we investigate the
performance of the energy detector (ED) when the arrival time
of the primary signal is modeled as a uniform random variable
over the observation interval. The exact formula for the detection
probability is derived and corroborated via numerical simulation.
To further improve the detection performance, we propose a
robust ED based on the Bayesian principle. Computer simulation
confirms the effectiveness of the Bayesian based solution when
compared with the conventional ED.

tection.
I. INTRODUCTION
COGNITIVE radio (CR) is a widely known opportunisticspectrum access technique for enhancing the cell-wide
spectrum utilization efficiency [1-2]. In order to detect the idle
frequency band so as to gain the channel access, spectrum
sensing performed at the CR users is indispensible. In the
literature, the detection of idle spectrum is typically considered
as a binary hypothesis test, and a commonly used signal model
under both hypotheses is [1-2]
ℋ0 : 𝑥[𝑛] = 𝑣[𝑛], 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑁 − 1 (idle)
ℋ1 : 𝑥[𝑛] = 𝑠[𝑛] + 𝑣[𝑛], 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑁 − 1 (occupied)
(1.1)
where 𝑁 is the length of the data record, 𝑠[𝑛], 𝑥[𝑛], 𝑣[𝑛] are,
respectively, the signal of the primary user, the received signal
at the CR terminal, and the measurement noise. The hypoth-
esis model (1.1) implicitly assumes perfect synchronization
between the primary transmitter and the CR receiver. Such an
assumption, however, is not valid in many practical situations.
For example, in an overlay femto cell network [3], the signal
of the macro mobile subscriber, synchronized with the macro
base station (BS), will arrive at a femto BS asynchronously.
The spectrum detection at the femto BS is typically subject

to timing misalignment of the primary signal [4], [5]. Also,
in heavy-traffic networks in which primary users may dynam-
ically enter the network, time delays observed in the sensing
period is unavoidable, especially when a long sensing duration
is adopted for obtaining good sensing performance. Thus, in
the aforementioned cases, a more reasonable signal model for
the binary hypothesis test is thus
ℋ0 : 𝑥[𝑛] = 𝑣[𝑛], 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑛0 − 1 (idle)
ℋ1 :
{
𝑥[𝑛] = 𝑣[𝑛], 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑛0 − 1
𝑥[𝑛] = 𝑠[𝑛] + 𝑣[𝑛], 𝑛0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑁 − 1 (occupied)
(1.2)
where 𝑛0 accounts for the primary signal arrival time.
Therefore, in contrast to the spectrum sensing schemes in the
literature focusing on the synchronized signal model (1.1)
[1-2], this paper considers the spectrum detection aimed for
tackling signal timing uncertainty under the hypothesis (1.2).
Among the existing spectrum sensing schemes, the energy
detector (ED) [6] is quite popular mainly because it involves
only the partial knowledge (the second moment) of the pri-
mary signal and is thus cost-effective to implement [1-2].
Even though various performance characteristics of the ED
have recently been investigated, e.g., [7-9], the discussions
in all these works were based on the idealized model (1.1).
In this paper, we study the detection performance of ED
under the hypothesis (1.2). As the detection of arrival is the
main focus, as in [10], we consider the scenario that the
primary user is present only after spectrum sensing is started.
Motivated by the fact that, in high-traffic random access
networks, the traffic patterns of primary users are typically
unknown to the secondary users, the signal arrival time 𝑛0
is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the observation
window 0 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 𝑁 − 1. Specific technical contributions of
this paper can be summarized as follows. Firstly, conditioned
on a fixed 𝑛0, the exact formula for the conditional detection
probability under the hypothesis model (1.2) is derived. The
average detection probability can then be accordingly obtained
by taking the expectation with respect to 𝑛0. To the best of
our knowledge, the performance study shown in this paper is
the original contribution in the literature that is tailored for the
ED scheme in the realistic sensing environment characterized
by the model (1.2). Secondly, to further exploit the prior
knowledge about 𝑛0 for improving the detection performance,
we also propose a robust ED based on the Bayesian formu-
lation [6]. Simulation study shows that the Bayesian based
solution improves the receiver operation characteristics (ROC).
Moreover, under a prescribed detection probability threshold,
the Bayesian scheme does lead to a smaller false-alarm

where (a) holds by using Lemma 2.1. Hence, for a given
threshold 𝛾 determined according to the prescribed false-
alarm probability, the conditional detection probability can be

B. Low-SNR Regime
While the formula (2.17) appears quite involved, in
the low-SNR regime it admits a very simple form that is
compatible with the existing study of ED [6]. To see this,
we need the next lemma, which provides an upper and lower
bounds for the conditional detection probability 𝑃𝐷(𝑛0).

To gain further insight based on (2.18), let us assume
without loss of generality that the total number of samples
𝑁 is even, so that 𝑁/2 is a positive integer. In this case, we
have Γ(𝑁/2) = [(𝑁/2) − 1]! and Γ(𝑁/2, 𝑦) = [(𝑁/2) −

since the limiting probability is independent of 𝑛0, we have
the following asymptotic result.

Does More Transmitting Sensors Always Mean
Better Decision Fusion in Censoring Sensor
Networks with An Unknown Size?
Tsang-Yi Wang, Member, IEEE and Jwo-Yuh Wu, Member, IEEE
Abstract—This paper examines the impact of sensor censoring
on the decision fusion performance in networks with an unknown
number of sensors. In performing the decision fusion process, the
fusion center applies the Chair-Varshney test; suitably modified
to take account of the unknown network size. A closed-form
analytical expression is derived for the error probability of the
modified fusion rule. It is shown that reducing the censoring
probability, i.e., allowing a greater number of sensors to transmit
their decisions, does not necessarily improve the decision fusion
performance. Rather, there exists a certain censoring probability
threshold below which increasing the number of transmitting
sensors simply incurs a greater intra-network communication
overhead but without improving the global decision performance.
Our findings establish that the design of energy-efficient local de-
tection rules should commence with the censoring rate threshold.
Hence, it is desirable that the value of this censoring probability
threshold be known in advance. Accordingly, the present study
proposes an efficient method for identifying the censoring prob-
ability threshold value and determining the corresponding local
censoring rule.

I. INTRODUCTION
DUE to the finite energy budget of the sensor nodesdeployed in most wireless sensor networks (WSNs),
energy consumption is a vital concern when implementing
distributed decision fusion. It has been shown that significant
savings in the communication overhead can be achieved by
utilizing a sensor censoring policy in which the local nodes
transmit their decisions to the fusion center (FC) if they are
judged to be informative, but remain silent if they are not [1]–
[12]. In the schemes presented in [1], [10] and [9, Scenario
C], the sensors transmit the non-quantized value of the log-
likelihood ratio (LLR) to the FC in the event that the LLR
falls within the “send” region. By contrast, in [2], the sensors
transmit a 1-bit decision to the FC if the LLR falls within the

“send” region. The present study adopts a similar “yes/no”
sensor censoring scheme to that proposed in [2]. However,
to increase the amount of information made available to the
FC when performing the global decision making process, the
LLR is divided into three instead of two [2] regions, namely
“send 1”, “send -1” and “no send”, as shown in Fig. 1.
Similar censoring schemes have also been proposed in [5],
[11], [12] (see also the no-send-zone quantizer in [9, Scenario
N]). However, the fusion rule adopted in this study is different
from those used in [5], [11]. Moreover, the problem considered
in the present study is different from those considered in [9,
Scenario N]) and [12], i.e., minimizing associated system costs
related to the detection performance subject to different energy
constraints and assumptions. Most importantly, the present
problem differs from those considered in [1]–[12] in that the
number of operating sensors is assumed to be unknown to the
FC.

Fig. 1. Proposed censoring scheme at local nodes.
The censoring scheme depicted in Fig. 1 can be regarded as
a three-level quantizer, in which the censored region represents
an additional quantization level (see also [5, eq. (2)]). It was
shown in [13] that three-level local quantization schemes yield
a better fusion performance than two-level quantizers when the
number of nodes within the network is known to the FC. In
addition, it was shown in [5] that in networks with a known
size, the use of an additional quantization level overcomes the
negative effects of erroneous local decisions and improves the
global fusion performance as a result.1 This findings implies
that in WSNs with a known number of sensor nodes, three-
level quantization schemes offer the potential for achieving the
same level of detection performance as two-level quantizers,
but with a lower energy consumption. A major objective of
the present study is to investigate whether or not this finding
also holds true for networks of an unknown size.
1In [5], the GLRT fusion rule with the LS channel estimate does not
require any information regarding the number of sensors when performing the
fusion process. However, the design of the censoring rule for the employed
fusion rule does require a knowledge of the number of sensors. Moreover, the
obtained result regarding the effectiveness of eliminating the effect of local
decision errors depends on the total number of sensors in the network.

Furthermore, hk is not assumed to be distributed in accordance
with a specific distribution when proving the existence of
the starting point. However, in analyzing the fusion error
probability, hk is assumed to be Rayleigh distributed. Having
received signals {yk}Kk=1 from all K nodes, the FC makes a
global decision, u0, regarding the existence (or otherwise) of
H1 in accordance with a predesigned fusion rule.
B. Some Definitions
The detection performance of the local sensors is char-
acterized by the false alarm probability and the detection
probability, denoted as pfj = Pr (uj = 1|H0) and pdj =
Pr (uj = 1|H1), respectively. In addition, the study defines the
missing probability as pmj = Pr (uj = −1|H1), and the local
censoring probabilities under the two hypotheses as q0j =
Pr (uj = 0|H0) and q1j = Pr (uj = 0|H1), respectively. To
facilitate the analysis, it is assumed that the local sensor nodes
all use the same local decision rule, i.e., decisions u1, . . . , uN
are independent and identically distributed. Thus, it follows
that pfj = pf , pdj = pd, pmj = pm, q0j = q0, and q1j = q1
for all j.
Definition 1: Let the censoring probability pc be defined as
Pr (uj = 0) = π0q0 + π1q1.
If pc is large, more sensors reside in the silent mode. Thus,
the network-wide energy consumption is reduced, but less
local decision information is available to the FC. Conversely,
if pc is small, more sensors transmit their local decisions,
and thus the FC receives a greater amount of information,
but at the expense of a larger global energy expenditure. Con-
sequently, in networks of an unknown size, the question arises
as to whether reducing the censoring probability pc without
bound (i.e., allowing more and more sensors to transmit) is
guaranteed to yield an improved decision fusion performance.
To answer this question, some mathematical definitions are
required.
Let Pe(pc) be the probability of the fusion error asso-
ciated with the censoring probability pc. Furthermore, let
S 
{
pc
∣∣∣∣pc = arg minpc∈[0,1]Pe(pc)
}
be the set of all pc’s
which yield the minimal fusion error probability.
Definition 2: A starting point when searching for an appro-
priate sensor censoring probability (or starting point for short)
exists, if S contains at least one non-zero element. In this case,
the starting point is defined as p∗c = maxpc∈S pc.
Among all pc ∈ S which achieve the best decision fusion
performance, the starting point p∗c (if it exists) is the value of
pc which results in the minimal overall energy consumption.
In other words, the starting point represents a suitable design
target for any plausible censoring scheme.
III. MAIN RESULTS
A. Proposed Modified Chair-Varshney Fusion Rule
According to the received signal model given in (1), it
seems reasonable to derive fusion rules which use the real-
numbered value of yk as the observations. However, since
the instantaneous fading amplitude is unknown to the FC,
the optimal likelihood ratio (LR) fusion rules based on yk
provided in [24], [25] cannot be applied. Moreover, although
an optimal fusion rule based on yk can be established for the
case where the instantaneous fading amplitude is unknown but
the channel statistics are available, the resultant fusion rule
(see [25, eq. (15)]) is highly complex. Thus, the present study
proposes a sub-optimal fusion rule in which the quantized
decisions are taken as the observations rather than the received
signal yk. The proposed fusion rule is not only simple, but also
avoids the need for a knowledge of the instantaneous fading
amplitude (and therefore eliminates the energy overhead which
would otherwise be required to estimate this information). As
a result, the proposed decision rule is ideally suited to real-
world WSNs, which are typically subject to low-complexity
and low-energy-consumption requirements. Since the alphabet
of uk ∈ Us is {+1,−1}, the maximum likelihood (ML)
estimate for uk given (1) is as follows:
uˆk = sign(yk), for k : uk ∈ Us. (2)
Therefore, uˆk = sign(yk) is used to represent the local
decision, which is then fused with that of the other sensors
to determine which of the two hypotheses exists. When the
local decisions uˆk are taken as the sensor observations, the
CV fusion rule [18] is optimal in the sense of minimizing the
Bayesian cost.4
Let the following definitions be introduced: p1j = Pr(yj >
0, uj = 0|H1) and p0j = Pr(yj > 0, uj = 0|H0). When the
number of operating nodes is known to the FC, the CV fusion
rule has the form [18] (see also [24], [25])5
ΛCV =
∑
j:uj∈Us,sign(yj)=1

∑

1− p1j − q1j
1− p0j − q0j
+
∑
j:uj∈Uc
log
q1j
q0j
. (3)
However, when the number of local sensors is unknown to the
FC, the set Uc is unknown and hence the CV rule given in (3)
cannot be applied. A heuristic method for modifying the CV
rule is to simply ignore the information contained in the term∑
j:uj∈Uc log
q1j
q0j
. In other words, the following MCV rule is
obtained:
ΛMCV =
∑
j:uj∈Us,sign(yj)=1
log
p1j
p0j
+
∑
j:uj∈Us,sign(yj)=−1
log
1− p1j − q1j
1− p0j − q0j
. (4)
The following theorem shows that the MCV rule given in
(4) has the same optimality as the CV rule given in (3).
In other words, as for the original CV rule, the MCV rule
minimizes the Bayesian cost given uˆk as the observations, but
is applicable for the case in which the number of operating
nodes is unknown to the FC rather than known.
Theorem 1: Consider a WSN in which the number of local
nodes is unknown to the FC and only the local decisions uˆk’s
4When the channel model given in (1) is considered, the CV fusion rule is
sub-optimal [24], [25].
5The CV fusion rule considered in this paper uses p1j and p0j as the local
detection performance rather than pfj and pdj as considered in [24], [25].
That is, the considered CV rule incorporates the effect of the channel error
into the local detection performance.
WANG AND WU: DOES MORE TRANSMITTING SENSORS ALWAYS MEAN BETTER DECISION FUSION. . . 5
Since all the sensors use the same local decision rule, the
signals received at the FC, i.e., {yk}Kk=1, are independent and
identically distributed, and thus p1 = p1k , p0 = p0k , q1 = q1k ,
and q0 = q0k , ∀k. The error probability of the MCV rule can
therefore be derived as

where τi is a function of the number of transmitting sensors,
i.e., N − i. When an identical local decision rule is utilized at
all the sensors, the MCV rule reduces to the τi out of N − i
fusion rule if p1 > p0 and 1−q0−p0 > 1−q1−p1. Note that
the assumption that the local probability of a correct detection
is greater than that of a detection error is reasonable in
distributed detection systems. The value of τi can be obtained
as τi = 	τ∗i

 denotes the standard ceiling function. Note that (13)
can be derived by starting from (5) and exploiting the fact
that the MCV rule in (4) is monotonic (see [18, p. 63] for
the definition of the monotonicity of a fusion rule). When
the number of sensors, N , is a random variable, the error
probability of the MCV rule can be generalized as
Pe = EN
[
Pe|N
]
. (14)
Equations (12) and (14) each provide a solution for the exact
error probability of the MCV fusion rule. However, both
equations require an enormous computational effort when N
is large. Hence, for computational convenience, the following
low-complexity proposition is proposed for obtaining the
upper bound on the fusion error probability.
Proposition 1: Let Pe be the average probability of the
detection error defined in (12). Furthermore, assume that all of
the local sensors apply the same decision rule. It can therefore
be shown that

where ηi = 2τi − N + i, and Ei|H0 and Ei|H1 denote the
conditional expectations with respect to the random number
of silent nodes i under hypotheses H0 and H1, respectively.
Note that i follows a binomial distribution with parameters
N and q0 if H0 is true, and follows a binomial distribution
with parameters N and q1 if H1 is true. In the case where the
MCV rule reduces to the majority voting rule, i.e., ηi = 0 for
all i, the error bound P e|N can be simplified as

C. Proof of Existence of Starting Point when Utilizing MCV
Fusion Rule
Based on the exact error probability function given in (12),
this subsection proves the existence of a starting point for the
MCV rule. The proof requires the following two lemmas:
Lemma 1: limpc→1 Pe(pc) = 1 and limpc→0 Pe(pc) ≤ 1.
Proof: See Appendix.
Lemma 2: Assume that the hypotheses are equally likely.
If τ1 = τ0−1, then pτ0−11 (1−p1)N−τ0 ≥ pτ0−10 (1−p0)N−τ0 .
Otherwise, if τ1 = τ0, then pτ0−11 (1 − p1)N−τ0 ≤ pτ0−10 (1 −
p0)N−τ0 .

Lemmas 1 and 2, the following key result is obtained.

However, this condition is too complicated to give any insight into the
theorem. Moreover, it should be noted that the assumption of equally-likely
hypotheses is reasonable for a wide range of applications.

a starting point exists provided that the condition given in
(20) holds. Investigation shows that this condition generally
holds for most censoring detection schemes. However, since
the condition is quite general, it is too complicated to provide
any real insights into the underlying physical significance. As
a result, the following lemma is proposed to provide a simple
sufficient condition for (20).
Lemma 3: Condition (20) holds if for some 0 < ε < 1,
p′0(0)−
(N − τ0)p0
(1− p0)τ0 p
′
0(0) ≤ −ε, (28)
and
(τ0 − 1)(1− p1)
p1(N − τ0 + 1) (1 + p
′
1(0))− (1 + p′1(0)) ≤ −1 + ε. (29)
Proof: See Appendix.
Based on Lemma 3, the following corollary is obtained for
establishing the existence of a starting point under a much
simpler condition than that given in (20).
Corollary 1: Consider the case in which both hypotheses
are equally likely. In addition, assume that p0 → 0 and p1 →
1. If −1 ≤ p′0(0) ≤ −ε and 0 ≥ p′1(0) ≥ −ε for some
0 < ε < 1, then S contains at least one non-zero element, and
hence a starting point exists.
Proof: If p0 → 0 and p1 → 1, then
(N − τ0)p0
(1 − p0)τ0 → 0
and
(τ0 − 1)(1− p1)
p1(N − τ0 + 1) → 0.
The corollary then follows from Theorem 2 and Lemma 3.
Corollary 1 provides theoretical support for the existence
of a starting point for the case where the local detection
performance and channel status are both good, since p0 and p1
represent the false-alarm probability and detection probability,
respectively, for each sensor that are seen at the FC.
The conditions p′0(0) < −ε and p′1(0) > −ε can be roughly
interpreted as follows. Firstly, since
p0 + (1− p0 − q0)︸ ︷︷ ︸
c0
+q0 = 1, (30)
an incremental increase in q0, i.e., the censoring probability
under the null hypothesis, is caused by a decreasing p0 + c0.
In addition, c0 = Pr(yj < 0, uj = 0|H0) and p0 represent the
probabilities of a correct decision and an incorrect decision
under hypothesis H0, respectively. To achieve a better perfor-
mance as q0 increases from zero, i.e., limq0→0 ∂∂q0Pe(pc) ≤ 0,
the rate at which p0 decreases should intuitively be greater
than a certain value, i.e., p′0(0) ≤ −δ0 for δ0 > 0. Conversely,
it follows from (30) that since the constraint p′0 + c′0 = −1
must hold, the rate at which c0 decreases should be less than a
certain value. Similarly, the rate at which p1 decreases should
also be less than a certain value, i.e., p′1(0) ≥ −δ1 for δ1 > 0.
Since a Bayesian philosophy is considered in the present study,
the error probability is averaged over both hypotheses H0
and H1. In other words, the conditions p′0(0) ≤ −δ0 and
p′1(0) ≥ −δ1 must be constrained together. Moreover, if the
rate at which p0 decreases is loosely allowed over a wide
range spanning from smaller to larger, then the rate at which
p1 decreases must be strictly limited to a narrow range of
smaller values such that limpc→0 ∂∂pc Pe(pc) ≤ 0. Conversely,
if the rate at which p0 decreases is restricted to a narrow
range of larger values, then the rate at which p1 decreases
must be loosely allowed over a wide range spanning from
larger to smaller in order to satisfy limpc→0 ∂∂pc Pe(pc) ≤ 0.
The preceding discussions tend to imply the conditions given
in Corollary 1, i.e., p′0(0) ≤ −ε and p′1(0) ≥ −ε for some
0 < ε < 1. Therefore, it is inferred that the conditions
provided in Theorem 2 easily hold. As a consequence, the
existence of a starting point in many distributed detection
schemes is confirmed.
As stated in the following corollary, given the assumptions
of p0 → 0 and p1 → 1, a much simpler condition than that
given in (18) in Footnote 6 can be obtained for the existence
of a starting point in the case where the hypotheses are not
assumed to be equally likely.
Corollary 2: Assume that p0 → 0 and p1 → 1. If −1 ≤
αp′0(0) ≤ −ε and 0 ≥ p′1(0) ≥ −ε for some 0 < ε < 1,
where
α =
pτ0−10 (1 − p0)N−τ0
pτ0−11 (1 − p1)N−τ0
,
then S contains at least one non-zero element, and hence a
starting point exists.
Proof: Resuming from condition (18) given in Footnote
6 and following the same procedures as those described in
Lemma 3 and Corollary 1, the result immediately follows.
Remark 1: The existence of the starting point stems from
the fact that in the considered censoring scheme, the additional
information provided by the censored region does not consume
any energy. However, the amount of additional information
provided by the censored sensors which can actually be
utilized by the FC depends on whether or not the total number
of operating sensors is known. In the case where the number
of local sensors is known, the information carried by the no-
transmission nodes can be accurately obtained, as described
in Section I. In the case where the number of local sensors is
unknown, the full information carried by the no-transmission
nodes cannot be utilized by the fusion rule. Nonetheless,
the MCV rule still uses some of the information generated
by the no-transmission nodes (i.e., the conditional censoring
probabilities q0 and q1 in (4)). In addition, the number of
local decisions ‘1’ and ‘-1’ received at the FC also depends
on the local censoring probabilities. Thus, the number of terms
included in the first and second summations in the MCV rule
(i.e. (4)) is also determined by the local censoring rule. The
performance gain obtained by censoring schemes relative to
traditional (i.e., non-censoring) schemes in the case where the
number of operating nodes is unknown arises also due to the
greater inherent reliability of the local decisions ‘1’ and ‘-1’
in the former schemes.
This subsection has proven the existence of a starting point
when utilizing the MCV fusion rule. A knowledge of the start-
ing point is beneficial in formulating constrained optimization
problems for accomplishing energy-efficient detection and in
finding their solutions. For example, consider the following
two problems, in which φ denotes the local censoring strategy
at each node.

for t1 and t2. In addition, set Δt = 0, t1 = Rl, and
t2 = t1 + Δt. Finally, set Dopt = 0, t1,opt = t1,
t2,opt = t2, and pc,opt = 0.
Step 2: Determine the values of q1 and q0 in accordance
with
q1 =
∫ ∞
−∞
1(t1 < L(zj) < t2)g1(z)dz
and
q0 =
∫ ∞
−∞
1(t1 < L(zj) < t2)g0(z)dz.
Find the values of p1 and p0 using (10) and (11),
respectively, where
pd =
∫ ∞
−∞
1(L(zj) > t2)g1(z)dz
and
pf =
∫ ∞
−∞
1(L(zj) > t2)g0(z)dz.
Determine the value of D using (31). If D > Dopt,
update Dopt ← D, t1,opt ← t1, t2,opt ← t2, and
pc,opt ← π0q0 + π1q1.
Step 3: Update thresholds as t1 ← t1+Δr and t2 = t1+Δt
and repeat Step 2 until t2 ≥ Ru.
Step 4: Update Δt as Δt ← Δt + Δr, and reset the
thresholds as t1 = Rl and t2 = t1 + Δt. Repeat
Steps 2 to 4 until Δt ≥ Ru −Rl.
Remark 4: The algorithm presented above for finding the
starting point may not result in an optimal solution. The sub-
optimality of the proposed algorithm stems from the fact that
the objective of the optimization process is to maximize the
C-divergence, which does not minimize the fusion error prob-
ability directly. Nonetheless, the starting point found by the
proposed algorithm is identical to that found by minimizing
the error probability for the case where the pdfs of the sensor
measurements correspond to those given in the first example
of the following section and N = 2.10
Remark 5: Near-optimal solutions for Problems 1 and 2
can be found by replacing the error probability Pe with the
C-divergence. In addition, for Problem 1 with κ ≤ p∗c , the
solution is the same as the starting point obtained using the
algorithm described above (see Remark 2).
IV. NUMERICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS
In evaluating the performance, four different scenarios are
considered. In all four scenarios, it is assumed that the
hypotheses are equally likely and that all of the sensor obser-
vations have the same distribution when conditioned on each
hypothesis. The number of sensors N used in the evaluations
is set as 20, 30, and 40, unless stated otherwise. However,
the number of operating sensors within the ROI is unknown
to the FC. For comparison purposes, the results obtained for
the error probability of the CV rule are also provided. Note,
however, that in applying the CV rule, it is assumed that the
number of operating sensors is known to the FC. In evaluating

due to the computational intractability.
the performance of the two rules, the channel signal-to-noise
ratio (CSNR) is defined as γ = E[h2k]/σ2 and is assumed to
have a value of CSNR= 5 dB. Finally, the censoring region
of the local quantizer is based on the domain of the sensor
measurement zj , which is mapped from the LLR domain given
in (32).11 As a result, the censoring rule is determined by the
thresholds b+ t and b− t, where b is a fixed point and t varies
in accordance with the value of pc.12
In the first example, the sensor observations are randomly
drawn from unit-variance Gaussian distributions with means
of m0 and m1 corresponding to H0 and H1, respectively.
Moreover, b is set as m0+m12 , which is the point of zj such that
g1(zj) = g0(zj). The point b = m0+m12 also matches the cen-
tral point of the censoring region (in the measurement domain)
found by the algorithm described in Subsection III-D. As a
result, it follows that pc = Q(m0−m12 − t) −Q(m0−m12 + t).
The observation signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) is defined as
20 log10 |m1 −m0|, and is set to 0 dB in the first example.
Fig. 2 plots the simulated error probability, the theoretical
error probability obtained using (12), and the upper bound
of the error probability obtained using (16). As shown, the
error probability varies as a convex function of the censoring
probability. In addition, it is seen that the behavior of the error
bound is consistent with that of the true error probability. It is
observed that the starting points of the curves corresponding to
N = 20, 30, and 40, respectively, are all located at the same
point, which confirms that the location of the starting point
and the corresponding local censoring rule are independent of
the number of sensors. From an inspection of the numerical
results, the starting point is determined to be 0.4042. Note that
an identical value is obtained from the algorithm presented
in Subsection III-D. This value represents a suitable starting
point for the censoring probability of the local sensors when
designing a decision fusion network based upon the MCV
rule. Interestingly, the results presented in Fig. 2 show that the
error probability of the MCV rule is equal to that of the CV.
This result arises because in this particular example, q0 and
q1 have the same value, and thus the CV rule in (3) reduces
to the MCV rule in (4).
In the second example, the same signal model as that used
in the first example is utilized, but N is treated as a random
variable. Specifically, N is drawn randomly in accordance with
a Poisson distribution of p(N) = λNe−λ/N ! with λ = 30.13
Fig. 3 plots the simulated error probability, the theoretical error
probability obtained using (14), and the upper bound on the
error probability obtained using (17). As in Fig. 3, the results
confirm the existence of a unique starting point.
In the third example, the distributions of the sensor obser-
vations under H0 and H1 are assumed to be asymmetric rather
than symmetric (i.e., as assumed in the first two examples).
11In all of the examples considered in this section, the mapping of the
censoring region in the sensor measurement domain and that in the LLR
domain is one-to-one.
12Although the optimal local quantizer design corresponding to each value
of pc should be based on two independent thresholds, i.e., b + t′1 and b +
t′2, the required computational effort is unaffordable since it involves a two-
dimensional optimization problem (with respect to both t′1 and t′2).
13When N varies in accordance with a Poisson distribution, the er-
ror probabilities can be approximated by finding N1 and N2 such that∑N2

performed using a version of the Chair-Varshney rule suitably
modified to take account of the unknown network size. A
closed-form analytical expression for the error probability
of the considered fusion rule has been obtained and a low-
complexity method for computing the upper bound has been
derived. It has been shown theoretically that in distributed de-
tection schemes in which the local sensors employ an identical
decision rule, a censoring probability threshold exists, below
which increasing the number of local decisions transmitted to
the FC increases the energy expenditure within the network
but does not improve the global decision performance. The
numerical and simulation results have confirmed the existence
of this critical threshold value (referred to in this study as
the starting point). Thus, the results suggest that the design
of censoring schemes for WSNs in which the total number
of sensors is unknown should commence from this starting
point since a censoring probability lower than this point
not only yields a poorer performance, but also results in a
greater energy consumption. Accordingly, an efficient method
has been proposed for finding the starting point and the
corresponding local censoring rule. Finally, the simulation
results have shown that the fusion error probability varies as
a convex function of the censoring probability, and thus the
starting point is unique. The proof for this convexity property
will be examined in a future study.

The upper bound on the probability Pr(u0 = H1|H1) can be
obtained in a similar manner. The result given in (15) then
follows.
When ηi = 0 for all i, the result can be obtained by
substituting ηi = 0 into (34) and using the moment generating
function of the random variable i, which follows the binomial
distribution with parameters N and q0. Alternatively, the same
result can be obtained by exploiting the fact that
Pr (u0 = H0|H0)

We consider a wireless sensor network, in which N sensors 
cooperate with a FC for estimating an unknown deterministic 
parameter θ ∈ R . The local observation at the ith sensor node is 
                                    , 1i ix n i Nθ= + ≤ ≤ ,                         
( 2 . 1 ) 
where in ∈ R  is the zero-mean measurement noise with variance 
2
in
σ . As in [5], [7], we assume that the local measurements ix ’s 
are transmitted over N parallel flat-fading channels to the FC via 
the amplify-and-forward protocol. The received signal from the ith 
sensor, 1 i N≤ ≤ , can thus be described as 
 
( ) ,i i i i i i i i i i i i i i iy h p x v h p n v h p h p n vθ θ= + = + + = + +   (2.2) 
where ih ∈ R  is channel gain, ip  is the power amplification 
factor for the ith sensor, and iv ∈ R  is the zero-mean white noise 
with variance 2
iv
σ ; throughout the paper we shall set 2 2
iv v
σ σ= . 
Based on the received data iy ’s in (2.2) and assuming that the 
sensing noise in ’s are i.i.d. and are independent of the channel 
noise, the parameter θ  is estimated at the FC via the BLUE 
principle [1] as

Even though one may have a nominal measurement of the local 
sensing noise power 2
in
σ , the true noise condition could be even 
more worse due to, e.g., gradual drainage of battery power or 
sensor failures. Once a nominal noise power threshold, say, iδ , is 
determined for the ith sensor, we shall seek for a statistical 
characterization of the uncertain noise power degradation from iδ .

uncertainty is 2

Square random variable of degrees-of-freedom equal to one, for 
each 1 i N≤ ≤ . To further take into consideration that the 
severity of uncertainty could be different from sensor to sensor, in 
this paper we thus assume that the local sensing noise variance

where iδ  is the nominal noise variance at the ith node, 21iz χ∼  is 
the central Chi-Square random variable with degrees-of-freedom 
equal to one (assumed to be i.i.d. over i), and iα  reflects the 
severity of uncertainty of the ith sensor node. Regarding the 
distribution of the fading channels, we adopt the common 
assumption made in the literature (e.g., [1]) that the channel gains 
ih ’s are i.i.d. Rayleigh distributed. 
  The goal of this paper is to design the sensor power allocation 
factors ip ’s so as to improve the average MSE performance, 
taking into account the distributions of the sensing noise variance 
and fading channels. 
 
III. PROPOSED PERFORMANCE MEASURE 
 
A. Estimation Performance in Terms of ARMSE 
 
Even though the MSE is a widely used performance measure, 
the involved inverse operation (cf. (2.4)) in the considered BLUE 
scenario makes it rather difficult to derive an analytic expression 
for AMSE. This thus motivates us to seek for alternative 
performance measures that can, on the one hand, reflect the true 
AMSE tendency and is more analytically tractable on the other 
hand. For this purpose, let us start with fixed realizations of 
sensing noise variances 2
in
σ ’s and channel gains ih ’s, and 
consider the estimation performance constraint via the MSE (2.4): 
 
                                    ( )

where ε  denotes the target distortion level. It is crucial to observe 
that (3.1) can be equivalently rewritten in terms of the reciprocal of 
MSE (RMSE) as

Hence, given the instantaneous 2
in
σ ’s and ih ’s, it is equivalent to 
consider RMSE as the performance measure; the larger RMSE is, 
the better the estimation accuracy will be. From an analytical 
perspective, the RMSE is more appealing than MSE since it no 
longer involves the “inverse operation”; as will be shown later, this 
attractive feature allows us to find an associated average 
performance metric that will facilitate analytic study of the power 
allocation problem. Motivated by these facts, we thus propose to 
consider the average reciprocal MSE (ARMSE) as the performance 
metric for the robust distributed BLUE:

being the associated distributions. A large D is expected to yield 
good estimation accuracy, which in turn suggests that the sensor 
power allocation factors should be designed to keep D as large as 
possible. 
 
  Even thought the aforementioned approach is intuitively 
reasonable, the AMSE is in general not equal to 1D−  (this can be 
directly verified by using the Jensen’s inequality). Thus, a 
fundamental question that remains yet to be answered is whether 
the true AMSE can be kept small (and to what extent) once D is 
enlarged. The following theorem characterizes a fundamental 
relationship between 1D−  and the true AMSE (the proof is given 
in the appendix). 187
where (a) follows from the well-known Chernoff bound 
2 / 2( ) /2xQ x e−≤ . Inequality (4.2) provides a lower bound for the 
cost function in problem (4.1) which is now convex in terms of the 
power allocation factor ip . Hence, instead of directly maximizing 
the cost function in (4.1), we propose to maximize the lower bound 
(4.2); this will allow us to derive closed-form suboptimal solution, 
as will be seen later. The optimization problem thus becomes

B. Numerical Performance 
 
  This section conducts several numerical simulations to evidence 
the presented analyses. We consider a network of 250N =  
sensors, and the channel noise variance is set to be 2 0.05vσ = . 
The local sensing noise variance uncertainty parameters iα ’s are 
generated uniformly in the interval  [0 ]α , where 0α >  is the 
global uncertainty factor; the noise variance thresholds iδ ’s are 
likewise drawn uniformly from [0 ]δ , where 0δ >  accounts for 
the maximal nominal value. With 5α =  and 1δ = , Figure 1 
compares the AMSE performance of the robust scheme (4.4) and 
the nominal non-robust solution obtained via setting 0iα =  in 
(4.4) for different total transmit power P. It can be seen that the 
proposed robust design does reduce the AMSE. Also, the AMSE is 
seen to decrease with P. This is intuitively reasonable since a large 
transmit power can enhance the overall signal quality at the FC for 
improving the global estimation accuracy; a similar phenomenon 
has also been seen in many previous works, e.g., [5]. With 
40P =  and 1δ = , Figure 2 depicts the AMSE with respect to 
different global uncertainty factors α . The figure shows that, with 
a fixed system power, the AMSE increases with the uncertainty 
factor α . This is not unexpected since, as α  increases, the 
deviation of the true noise variance from its nominal value also 
increases, thereby degrading the global estimation quality. 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
 
  This paper has presented an original contribution to the study of 
power allocation for robust distributed BLUE in the presence of 
sensing noise variance uncertainty. The proposed design criterion 
in terms of ARMSE has several unique advantages. Firstly, it is 
established that with a small target AMSE the inverse of ARMSE 
is a close approximation to the true AMSE. Given this appealing 
fundamental result, maximization of the ARMSE is thus a justified 
approach for enhancing the estimation quality. Secondly, starting 
from the ARMSE design metric, rigorous analyses are carried out 
to derive an analytically tractable objective function for the design 
of power allocation factors. The obtained solution is in a closed 
form, and is seen to outperform the non-robust design via computer 
simulation.

ABSTRACT
Energy consumption is a vital concern when implementing
distributed decision fusion in most wireless sensor networks.
This paper studies the impact of sensor censoring on the de-
cision fusion performance when the number of sensors is un-
known at the fusion center. The global decision rule adopted
at the fusion center is the Chair-Varshney fusion rule modi-
fied to take account of the unknown network size. It is shown
that under the assumption of equally likely hypotheses, allow-
ing more transmitting sensors does not necessarily yield bet-
ter decision fusion; rather, there exists a censoring probability
threshold below which the increase in the number of active
sensors just incurs more intra-network communication over-
head but will not improve the global decision performance.
Our findings establish that the design of energy-efficient lo-
cal detection rules should commence with the censoring rate
threshold.

1. INTRODUCTION
Energy consumption is a vital concern when implementing
distributed decision fusion in most wireless sensor networks
(WSNs). It has been shown that significant savings in the
communication overhead can be achieved by utilizing a sen-
sor censoring policy in which the local nodes transmit their
decisions to the fusion center (FC) if they are judged to be
informative, but remain silent if they are not [1–5]. In the
scheme presented in [1], the entire log-likelihood ratio (LLR)
value is transmitted, whereas in [2], only a binary decision
is sent to the fusion center (FC) if the LLR falls within the
“send” region. The present study adopts a similar “yes/no”
sensor censoring scheme. However, to increase the amount
of information made available to the FC when performing the
global decision making process, the LLR is divided not into
two regions as in [2], but into three, namely “send 1”, “send
-1” and “no send”, as shown in Fig. 1. A similar censoring

also considered in [4].

Fig. 1. Proposed censoring scheme at local nodes.
In fact, the censoring scheme depicted in Fig. 1 can be
regarded as a three-level quantizer, in which the censored re-
gion represents an additional quantization level (see also [4,
eq. (2)]). It has been shown in [4] that by using an additional
quantization level in the case in which the number of nodes is
known to the FC can improve the performance by overcom-
ing the negative effects of erroneous local decisions. This
finding implies that in WSNs with a known number of sensor
nodes, three-level quantization schemes offer the potential for
achieving the same quality of detection performance as two-
level quantizers, but with a lower energy consumption. A ma-
jor objective of the present study is to investigate whether this
finding still holds when the number of nodes is unknown to
the FC.
The problem of distributed detection with an unknown
number of sensors in the region of interest (ROI) is essen-
tial in WSNs [6, 7]. The issue of whether or not the num-
ber of nodes is known has a fundamental effect upon the fu-
sion process performed in the networks utilizing sensor cen-
soring schemes. Specifically, when the number of nodes is
known, the fusion center can obtain information from the no-
transmission nodes based on the knowledge of their corre-
sponding “no-send” regions and the number of no-transmission
nodes (see [1, eq. (4)] and [4, eq. (7)]). However, informa-
tion contributed by no-transmission nodes is difficult to infer
when the number of sensors is unknown to the FC.
This study considers the decentralized detection with de-
cision fusion performed in accordance with the modified Chair-
Varshney (MCV) fusion rule, a modification of the Chair-
Varshney rule (see [8]) for the case in which the number of
local sensors is unknown to the FC. We derive for the consid-

estimated local decisions ?ˆ?𝑘 as the observations, it is well
known that the Chair-Varshney fusion rule [8] is optimal in
the sense of minimizing the Bayesian cost.
Define 𝑝1𝑗 := Pr(𝑦𝑗 > 0, 𝑢𝑗 ∕= 0∣𝐻1) and 𝑝0𝑗 := Pr(𝑦𝑗 >
0, 𝑢𝑗 ∕= 0∣𝐻0). When the number of operating nodes is known
to the FC, the Chair-Varshney fusion rule for the considered
censoring local decisions can be derived as [8] (see also [9,
10])2

However, for the case in which the number of local sensors
is unknown to the FC, the set 𝒰𝑐 is unknown and hence the
Chair-Varshney rule given in (3) cannot be applied. A heuris-
tic way to modify the Chair-Varshney rule is then simply ig-
noring the information contained in the term

. (4)
In the following, we first provide an analysis of the er-
ror probability using the MCV fusion rule. Since all of the
sensors employ an identical local decision rule, the signals
received at the FC, i.e. {𝑦𝑘}𝐾𝑘=1, are independent and iden-
tically distributed, thus 𝑝1 = 𝑝1𝑘 , 𝑝0 = 𝑝0𝑘 , 𝑞1 = 𝑞1𝑘 , and
𝑞0 = 𝑞0𝑘 , ∀𝑘. The fusion error probability of the MCV fusion
rule can be derived as (5) (see the top of next page), where
𝜏𝑖 is a function of the number of the transmitting sensors, i.e.,
𝑁−𝑖. When the identical local decision rule is utilized, it can
be shown that the MCV rule reduces to the 𝜏𝑖 out of 𝑁 − 𝑖
fusion rule, and the value of 𝜏𝑖 can be obtained as 𝜏𝑖 = ⌈𝜏∗𝑖 ⌉,
where
𝜏∗𝑖 ≜

log {𝑝1(1− 𝑝0 − 𝑞0)/𝑝0(1− 𝑝1 − 𝑞1)} , (6)
and ⌈⋅⌉ denotes the standard ceiling function. The probability
of the fusion error given in (5) provides the exact error proba-
bility. For computational feasibility in large scale sensor net-
works, the proposition below provides an upper bound of the
fusion error probability. Note that the proof of the proposition
is omitted due to the page limit imposed for the publication.
2The Chair-Varshney fusion rule considered in this paper uses 𝑝1𝑗 and
𝑝0𝑗 as the local detection performance instead of 𝑝𝑓𝑗 and 𝑝𝑑𝑗 considered
in [9, 10]. That is, the effect of channel error is incorporated into the local
detection performance in our considered Chair-Varshney fusion rule.
Proposition 1 Let 𝑃𝑒 be the average probability of detection
error defined in (5). Assume that all of the local sensors apply
an identical decision rule. Then, 𝑃𝑒 is given by (7) (see the top
of next page), where 𝜂𝑖 = 2𝜏𝑖 −𝑁 + 𝑖, and 𝐸𝑖∣𝐻0 and 𝐸𝑖∣𝐻1
denote the conditional expectations with respect to the ran-
dom number of silent nodes 𝑖 under 𝐻0 and 𝐻1, respectively,
where 𝑖 follows the binomial distribution with parameters 𝑁
and 𝑞0 if 𝐻0 is true and follows the binomial distribution with
parameters 𝑁 and 𝑞1 if 𝐻1 is true. In addition, if the MCV
rule reduces to the majority voting rule, i.e., 𝜂𝑖 = 0 for all 𝑖,
we obtain

3.2. The proof of the existence of a starting point when
utilizing MCV fusion rule
Based on the true error probability function given in (5), this
subsection aims to prove the existence of a starting point for
the MCV rule.
To prove the existence of a starting point, the following
lemma is needed.
Lemma 1 lim𝑝𝑐→1 𝑃𝑒(𝑝𝑐) = 1 and lim𝑝𝑐→0 𝑃𝑒(𝑝𝑐) ≤ 1.
Proof: The proof is omitted here due to the page limit. □
Based on Lemma 1, we have the following key result.
Theorem 1 Consider the case in which the hypotheses are
equally likely. Assume that
− 1 < 𝑝′0 ≜
∂𝑝0(𝑞0)
∂𝑞0
< 0, 0 > 𝑝′1 ≜

𝑝1(𝑁 − 𝜏0 + 1) (1 + 𝑝
′
1(0)) + 1(𝜏1 = 𝜏0) < 0. (10)
Then 𝒮 contains at least one nonzero element, and, hence, a
starting point exists.
Proof: Due to the page limit, we only sketch the proof.
By Lemma 1, we have lim𝑝𝑐→0 𝑃𝑒(𝑝𝑐) ≤ lim𝑝𝑐→1 𝑃𝑒(𝑝𝑐).
Given conditions (9) and (10), it can be shown that 𝑃𝑒(𝑝𝑐)
decreases when 𝑝𝑐 increases from zero. This then guarantees
the existence of a local minimum attained at a nonzero 𝑝𝑐. □
It is noted that condition (10) given in Theorem 1 can eas-
ily hold in most censoring detectors based on our investiga-
tion. Specifically, for the case in which the local detection143

𝐻0, the sensor observations are distributed as Gaussian ran-

under 𝐻1, the observations are distributed as Gaussian ran-
dom variable with mean 𝑚0 = 1 and variance 𝜎21 = 4. When
making their decisions, the local sensors apply the thresholds
𝑏 + 𝑡 and 𝑏 − 𝑡, where 𝑏 is the point at which the densi-
ties of both hypotheses have the same value, and 𝑡 is deter-
mined by the censoring probability 𝑝𝑐. Specifically, 𝑝𝑐 =

2 (𝑄(

) − 𝑄( 𝑏+𝑡−𝑚1𝜎1 ) + 𝑄( 𝑏−𝑡−𝑚0𝜎0 ) − 𝑄( 𝑏+𝑡−𝑚0𝜎0 ))
in the example. Figure 3 plots the simulated error probability
and the theoretical error probability using (5) for the MCV
rule. The simulated error probability of the CV rule is also
plotted. It is evident from the figure that the starting point
also exists when the distributions under both hypotheses are
asymmetric. It can be also observed from the figure that the
performances of the MCV rule and the CV rule are generally
not the same because 𝑞0 and 𝑞1 are distinct in general. As
expected, the CV fusion rule has the better performance due
to using the additional information of the number of silent
nodes.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Based on a modified Chair-Varshney fusion rule, this study
has addressed the impact of sensor censoring on the global de-
cision performance when the number of sensors is unknown
to the FC. Under quite mild conditions on local detection per-
formances as well as under the assumption of equally likely
hypotheses, this study has proved the existence of an error
probability threshold, below which more transmitting sensors
are allowed but the proportional increase in the energy ex-
penditure does not improve the global decision performance.
Therefore, the design of energy-efficient censoring decision
fusion should commence from the starting point, since a cen-
soring probability lower than this point not only yields a poorer
fusion result, but also consumes a greater amount of energy.

II. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 
Consider the signal model 
                                       S I= +x x x ,                           (2.1) 
where pS ∈x R  is the signal of interest, and pI ∈x R  is the 
contaminating interference. As in [6-7], we assume that (i) 
both Sx  and Ix  are sparse vectors whose supports are, 
respectively, ST  and IT ; (ii) S IT T φ∩ = , the empty set; 
(iii) IT  is known at the receiver. The compressed signal 
model then reads 
S I= = +y x x xΦ Φ Φ ,                  (2.2) 
where m pΦ ×∈ R  is the sensing matrix with m p . Toward 
signal recovery against interference in the compressive 
domain, let us write (2.2) as 
IS T I
= +y x xΦ Φ ,                      (2.3) 
where | |I
I
m T
T
×∈ RΦ  consists of columns of Φ  indexed by 
the interference support IT
2, and | |ITI ∈x R  is obtained by 
disregarding the zero entries of Ix . To remove interference, 
one commonly-used approach is via orthogonal projection of 
the compressed data y  onto ( )
IT
N Φ , the null space of 
IT

[6-7]: 
SΦ Φ= =Py P x P x ,                      (2.4)

Φ Φ Φ Φ−−P I               (2.5) 
is the desired orthogonal projection matrix, with I  being the 
identity matrix and *()  denoting the conjugate transpose 
operation. To characterize the signal reconstruction 
performance based on (2.4), knowledge of the RIC of ΦP  is 
needed. As in [6], throughout this paper we assume that the 
sensing matrix Φ  satisfies RIP of order 2 S IT T+ , that is, 
there exists an 0 1δ< <  such that 
22 2
2 22(1 ) (1 )δ δ− ≤ ≤ +z z zΦ               (2.6) 
holds for all 2 S IT T+ -sparse vectors z . Given that Φ  
satisfies (2.6), the goal of this paper is to derive a closed-form 
expression of the RIC of ΦP . 
 
III. MAIN RESULTS 
 
This section presents the main results of this paper. Section 
III-A first leverages the geometric properties of the orthogonal 
projection to characterize the RIP and RIC of the effective 
sensing matrix ΦP . Section II-B then derives a closed-form 
expression of the RIC. The connection of our contributions to 
previous works will be discussed in Section IV. 
 
A. RIP/RIC of the Effective Sensing Matrix ΦP  
 
Let us proceed by specifying the RIP condition for the 
effective sensing matrix ΦP , i.e., inequalities in the form of 
(2.6) that characterize the achievable 22SΦP x  for sparse Sx . 
This can be done by leveraging the geometric property of the 
orthogonal projection. Specifically, let us decompose SΦx  
into 
( )S S SΦ Φ Φ= + −x P x I P x .                   (3.1) 
By definition of P  in (2.5), we immediately have

which is the orthogonal projection onto ( )

ΦR , the column 
space of 
IT
Φ . As a result, the term ( ) SΦ−I P x  can be 
expressed as 
( )
IS T I I
Φ Φ Φ′ ′− = =I P x x x ,                   (3.3) 
where ITI′ ∈x R , and pI′ ∈x R  is IT -sparse (with support 
IT ) that is obtained by padding Ip T−  zeros to I′x . Since 
P  is an orthogonal projection matrix, it follows immediately 
that (see Figure 1)

  From (3.22) and (3.23), it is easy to see that

IV. DISCUSSIONS 
 
Under the same assumptions made in Theorem 3.1, an 
algebraic based approach using the polarization identity along 
with inequalities (3.7)~(3.9) was adopted in [6-7], [11] to 
obtain the following RIP condition for ΦP :

Inequalities (4.1) asserts that the RIC of ΦP  is equal to aδ  in

it is easy to see from (3.25) and (4.3) that aδ δ< , that is, the 
proposed RIC in (3.25) is tighter. The numerical values of the 
proposed δ  and the algebraic based estimate aδ  with respect 
to different δ  are computed and plotted in Figure 2. It is seen 
that considerable improvement can be achieved by our 
solution for moderate3 δ . The significance of the established 
results is discussed below. 
 
A. Improved Signal Reconstruction Performance Evaluation 
 
  It is well-known that a small RIC of the sensing matrix yields 
a better signal reconstruction performance [1-3]. Specifically, 
assume that the commonly used 1l -minimization algorithm 
[10] is adopted for signal recovery, and let ˆSx  be the 
reconstructed sparse signal vector. Based on [12], the upper 
bounds of the reconstruction error determined in accordance 
with the proposed RIC δ (3.25) and the algebraic-based 
estimate aδ  (4.2) are, respectively,

integrand of (2.6) the “inverse operation” makes it quite 
difficult, if not impossible, to derive an analytic expression for 
the distortion measure (2.6); as a result, the design of the 
power allocation factors based on (2.6) is intractable. This thus 
motivates us to seek for alternate performance measures that 
can facilitate an analytically tractable problem formulation. In 
this paper, we propose to instead consider the averaged

corresponds to better estimation accuracy [11]. From an 
analytic perspective, (2.7) is more tractable than (2.6) since 
the integrand in (2.7) no longer involves the inverse operation. 
Given a target ARMSE threshold D, the goal of this paper is 
to derive a closed-form universal power amplification factors 
which can be uniformly deployed across sensors to meet the

III. MAIN RESULTS 
To solve the problem, one may proceed with finding an 
analytic expression of the ARMSE in (2.7). This, however, 
turns out to be intractable. The proposed approach, instead, lies 
in first deriving an analytic lower bound of ARMSE. To meet 
the performance requirement (2.8), we can then impose the 
obtained lower bound to be above D . In this way, we are then 
able to further derive a closed-form universal power loading 
factor, based on which (2.8) is fulfilled. Section III-A shows 
the proposed lower bound. Section III-B then derives the 
proposed solution. Some discussions are given in Section III-C.

Notably, a necessary condition for (3.14) to hold is 
 
                : ( )oN N Dα δ≥ = + ,                     (3.15) 
 
which imposes a constraint on the total number of sensors in 
order to achieve the performance constraint (2.8). Based on 
(3.14) and after some straightforward manipulations, the 
universal transmit power threshold is obtained as:

C. Discussions 
 
1. The transmit power threshold in (3.16) can be adopted 
uniformly across sensors to meet the target performance 
constraint (2.8). The significance of this result lies in that 
the power allocation factor can be analytically computed 
off-line, and can be used once and for all when the 
network is deployed. There is no need to know the 
instantaneous sensing noise variance and the channel state 
information in determining the transmit power. This can 
further reduce the intra-network coordination for power 
scheduling, and thus improves the network-wide energy 
efficiency. 
2. From (3.15), it can be seen that the minimal number of 
sensor nodes oN , as expected, increases with the ARMSE 
threshold D (recall that a large D means better estimation 
accuracy). Also, more sensors are needed if the sensing 
noise variance threshold δ  gets large. This is intuitively 
reasonable since, with a large δ , local sensor 
measurements tend to be severely corrupted by noise, and 
more sensors should be deployed to collect more data for 
smoothening the noise effect. Moreover, from (3.15), oN  
is seen to increase with the heterogeneity factor α . An 
interpretation of this result is that, when α  is large, the 
variation in the quality of the local sensor data will also 
be large. Hence, more sensors should be used in order to 
collect a sufficient amount of high-quality data for 
realizing the target estimation accuracy. 
3. It can be immediately seen from (3.16) that the power 
threshold 2op , as one may expect, increases with both the 
channel noise variance 2vσ  and the ARMSE threshold D. 
In addition, 2op  decreases with the network size N. 
4. From (3.16), it is easy to see that 2op  increases with both 
δ  and α . To see the rationale behind this phenomenon, 
we first note from (2.1) and (2.5) that the SNR of the local 
sensor measurement is given by 
                 
2 2
2
iE n
θ θ
α δ= + .                           (3.17) 
Hence, when either α  or δ  gets large, the quality of local 
sensor measurements become poor. To maintain a desired 
estimation quality, a large transmit power should be 
employed to improve channel link reliability (otherwise, 
the sensor measurements would be further distorted by the 
fading channels and the receive noise at the FC). 
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
 
This section conducts several numerical simulations to 
evidence our analyses. We consider a network of 250N =  
sensors. The ARMSE threshold is set to be 100D = , and the 
channel noise variance is 2 0.05vσ = . With 0.6δ = , Figure 1 
shows the minimal power level 2op  in (3.15) for 
0.2 1.2α≤ ≤ . Also, with 0.4α = , Figure 2 depicts 2op  for 
0.2 1.5δ≤ ≤ . The results show that 2op  increases with both 
α  and δ ; this confirms our analysis in the previous section. 
With the same system setup, Figure 3 and Figure 4 further 
show the simulated MSE when the proposed 2op  is used. It is 
noted from Figure 3 that the MSE decreases with α . This 
An explicit formula for the integral in (A.8) can be readily 
obtained by first letting 1t z= + , hence

III. QRR SCHEME
A. Design of QRR
Since the output SNR for the DF-relaying scheme is difficult
to define, in developing the QRR scheme, this paper adopts
the deflection coefficient [8], which is widely used as a
performance measure in detection theory and has the same
concept of the output SNR. For a given relay-to-destination
CSI g, the conditional deflection coefficient is given by
d2def :=
(Ex,w[z|s = +
√
Ps, g]−Ex,w[z|s = −
√
Ps, g])
2
Varx,w[z|s = −
√
Ps, g]
.
(6)
It can be shown that
Ex,w[z|s = +
√
Ps, g] =
M∑
i=1
αiE[ui|s = +
√
Ps, gi]
=
M∑
i=1
αigi(2p+ q − 1)
√
Pr
1− q . (7)
Similarly, we have
Ex,w[z|s = −
√
Ps, g] =
M∑
i=1
αigi(1− 2p− q)
√
Pr
1− q . (8)
In addition, the variance of z given g and s = −√Ps can be
obtained as
Varx,w[z|s = −
√
Ps, g]
= Ex,w
[
|z|2|s = −
√
Ps, g
]
−

|αi|2
(
|gi|2Pr
(
4p(1− p− q)
1− q
)
+ σ2w
)
. (9)
It immediately follows from (6), (7), (8), and (9) that
d2def =
(∑M
i=1 2αigi(2p+ q − 1)
√
Pr
1−q
)2
∑M
i=1 |αi|2
(
|gi|2Pr
(
4p(1−p−q)
1−q
)
+ σ2w
) . (10)
Denoting
ψi := α
∗
i
√
|gi|2Pr
(
4p(1− p− q)
1− q
)
+ σ2w
and
φi :=
2gi(2p+ q − 1)
√
Pr
1−q√
|gi|2Pr
(
4p(1−p−q)
1−q
)
+ σ2w
,
and applying the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we obtain
d2def ≤ d2def,opt, (11)
where
d2def,opt :=
M∑
i=1
φ2i =
M∑
i=1
4|gi|2Pr(2p+ q − 1)2
4|gi|2Prp(1− p− q) + σ2w(1− q)
.
(12)
By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, the equality in (11) holds
when ψi = cφi, where c is a constant. Thus, the optimal
combining coefficient αMDC,i that gives the maximum value
of d2def is given by
αMDC,i =
2cg∗i (2p+ q − 1)
√
Pr
1−q
|gi|2Pr
(
4p(1−p−q)
1−q
)
+ σ2w
.
B. Theoretical result
In the following, we prove that the QRR scheme outper-
forms the traditional DF-relaying scheme in terms of the
deflection coefficient. The analysis commences by establishing
the lemma below to show the existence of a local optimum
d2def attained at a nonzero q.
Lemma 1: If p(0) > 12 and
p′(0) > max
1≤i≤M
−4|gi|
2Prp(0) + σ
2
w(1 + 2p(0))
4|gi|2Pr + 4σ2w
, (13)
then the optimal qopt that gives the maximum value of d2def is
located at 0 < qopt < 1.
Proof: Due to the page limit, we only sketch the proof.
Firstly, it can be shown that
lim
q→0
d2def,opt ≥ lim
q→1
d2def,opt.
It then suffices to show that limq→0 d2def,opt increases when q
increases from zero, since this will guarantee the existence of
a local maximum attained at a nonzero q. It can be shown that
as long as p(0) > 12 and the condition given in (13) holds, then
limq→0
∂d2def,opt
∂q > 0. Finally, the assertion then follows from
the fact that d2def,opt is a continuous function of the probability
q.
Lemma 1 implies that if condition (13) holds, the QRR
scheme is better than the traditional DF-relaying scheme, since
the traditional DF-relaying scheme is the special case of QRR
with q = 0. To further investigate the conditions for 0 <
qopt < 1, the lemma below is provided.
Lemma 2: If the received signal model at each relay is
given in (1) and the breakpoints of the reliability quantizer
are set to be ηu = −ηl = η, then p′(0) = − 12 .
Proof: When the received signal model at ith relay is
given in (1), the probabilities p and q can be respectively
expressed as
p(η) =

Abstract—Knowledge of the achievable restricted isometry 
constant (RIC) of the sensing matrix is crucial for assessing the 
signal reconstruction performance of compressive sensing 
systems. In this paper we consider compressive-domain 
interference cancellation via orthogonal projection, and study the 
achievable RIC of the effective sensing matrix, namely, the 
product of the orthogonal projection matrix and the original 
sensing matrix. While existing algebraic based methods resorted 
to the polarization identity to find an upper bound of the 
considered RIC, motivated by geometric interpretations of the 
orthogonal projection and the restricted isometry property we 
derive an improved RIC in a closed form. The proposed solution 
is shown to be tighter than the existing upper bound. Our 
analytical results, and the asserted performance advantages, are 
further evidenced via computer simulations. 
Keywords-Compressive sensing; interference cancellation; 
restricted isometry property (RIP); restricted isometry constant 
(RIC). 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Compressive sensing (CS) is a new technique which 
exploits the sparsity nature inherent in wide classes of real-
world signals so as to facilitate efficient data acquisition, 
storage, and processing [1-3]. Applications of CS have been 
found in various areas, including analog-to-digital converters 
[4], magnetic resonance imaging [2], wireless communications 
[5-7], and sensor networks [8-9], to name just a few. In most 
cases, a CS system can be mathematically described as an 
underdetermined set of linear equations [1-3]. A fundamental 
issue intensively addressed in the CS literature is perfect, or 
stable, signal recovery based on the compressed measurements 
which are typically incomplete or even distorted [1-3]. It is 
well-known that, to guarantee reliable signal reconstruction, 
the sensing matrix must satisfy the so-called restricted 
isometry property (RIP) with a reasonably small restricted 
isometry constant (RIC) [1-3], [10]. Precise knowledge of the 
RIC of the sensing matrix is thus crucial for characterizing the 
achievable signal recovery performance of CS systems. 
Recently, the problem of recovering sparse signal 
contaminated by sparse interference was addressed in [6-7]. 
Specifically, prior to signal recovery from the compressed 
data, the interference in the compressive domain is first 
removed by means of orthogonal projection. Within such a 
“cancel-then-recover” framework, the effective sensing matrix 
is thus the product of the orthogonal projection matrix P and 
the original sensing matrix Φ  [6]. Hence, the knowledge of 
the RIC of effective sensing matrix ΦP  is needed to 
characterize the signal recovery performance. A fundamental 
issue that arises in this scenario is thus: Even though the RIC 
of Φ  is small, the numerical condition of ΦP  could be 
radically different from that of Φ , and the RIC of ΦP  will be 
larger than that of Φ . Actually, to guarantee a small RIC of 
ΦP , a more restricted bound of the RIC of the original 
sensing matrix Φ  is required [6]; however, this calls for 
potentially more data measurements [6-7]. Assuming that the 
supports of the signal and interference do not overlap, in [6-7], 
[11] an algebraic based approach based on the RIP in 
conjunction with polarization identity1 was used to derive an 
upper bound of the RIC of ΦP . However, the upper bound 
obtained via such an approach is known to be the worst-case 
estimate. Investigation of the achievable RIC of ΦP  in the 
context of orthogonal projection based sparse interference 
cancellation has not been found in the literature yet. 
This paper is aimed at analytically characterizing the RIC of 
the effective sensing matrix ΦP . With the aid of geometric 
interpretations of orthogonal projection and RIP, a closed-
form formula of the RIC of ΦP  is derived, and is shown to be 
tighter than the existing algebraic based solution proposed in 
[6-7], [11]. Hence, the established results allow for a more 
accurate evaluation of the signal reconstruction performance 
within the considered “cancel-then-recover” framework. In 
addition, to achieve a target threshold of the RIC of ΦP , our 
result allows for a less restricted requirement on the RIC of 
original sensing matrix Φ : this in turn implies that the 
measurement size can be further reduced. Computer

advantages asserted by the proposed solution.

(3.9) 
in deriving (3.9), we invoked the fact that Sx  and I′x  are 
orthogonal (since by assumption the respective supports ST  
and IT  do not overlap). Notably, inequalities (3.7)~(3.9) 
accordingly impose a feasible range of 2| cos |α . In [6-7] 
and [11], equation (3.6) in conjunction with the extreme 
values of 22SΦx ,

( )S IΦ ′±x x  specified by 
(3.7)~(3.9) was employed to obtain an upper bound of 
2| cos |α , which was then used to characterize the RIP/RIC 
of ΦP . Such an algebraic based approach, although 
conceptually simple, will result in the worst-case estimate of 
the RIC [14]. 
 
  To study the RIP/RIC of ΦP , we do not resort to direct 
search for the extreme values of 2| cos |α  via algebraic 
manipulations as in [6-7], [11]. In this paper, we propose to 
tackle the problem instead from a geometric perspective. 
Specifically, we will focus on analytic characterization of the 
measure of the achievable angle ( , )S Iα Φ Φ ′= x x( . Our 
approach is to first specifying the maximal and minimal 
achievable angles:

and 
{ } and  satisfy (3.7)~(3.9)min ( , )S I S IMinα Φ Φ Φ Φ′ ′x x x x (  
  (3.11) 
Once maxα  and minα  are obtained, the feasible 2| cos |α  
subject to the constraints (3.7)~(3.9) can be determined as 
                                   2| cos |L Uγ α γ≤ ≤ ,                      (3.12)

and 
                  { }2 min max| cos | |U Maxγ α α α α≤ ≤ .   (3.14) 
Based on (3.5) and by using (3.12), we immediately have

which through further rearrangements reads

We are now able to state the main result of this subsection. 
Theorem 3.1: Let P be the orthogonal projection matrix 
defined in (2.5). Assume that Φ  fulfills RIP of order 
2 S IT T+  with RIC δ . Then, for all ST -sparse Sx , we 
have 
2 2 2
2 2 2(1 ) (1 )S S Sδ δΦ− ≤ ≤ +x P x x ,       (3.19) 
where δ  is defined in (3.17). 
[Proof]: Since δ δ≤ , a “symmetric” form of RIP analogous 
to (2.6) can be directly obtained via (3.16) as 
2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2(1 ) (1 ) (1 )S S S Sδ δ δΦ− ≤ ≤ + ≤ +x P x x x , 
(3.20) 
which yields (3.19).                                                                □ 
Theorem 3.1 shows that the RIC of the effective sensing 
matrix ΦP  is given by δ  defined in (3.17). To derive a 
closed-form solution of δ , explicit knowledge of Uγ  is 
needed. From (3.14), we immediately have

Hence, it remains to find closed-form expressions for maxα  
and minα . This is done in the next subsection. 
 
B. Closed-Form Formula for the RIC δ  
 
  Motivated by the geometric interpretations of the RIP 
induced distance/norm inequalities (3.7)~(3.9), a plane 
geometry based formulation is proposed in [15] for the 
identification of maxα  and minα . Through plane geometry 
analyses, closed-form formulae for maxα  and minα  can be 
obtained, and the results are summarized in the following 
theorem (details omitted due to space limitation, and are 
referred to [15]). 
 
where ε  is the level of the data mismatch (measured in 2l -
norm). For 0.01ε = , Figure 3 plots the upper bounds in (4.4) 
and (4.5) as a function of δ . It can be seen that the proposed 
solution does yield a tighter estimate of the reconstruction 
error; for moderate δ  (say, 0.2δ > ) the improvement can be 
as large as 4.7 dB. 
 
B. Reduction in the Measurement Size 
 
  Given a target signal reconstruction performance upon 
interference removal, a tighter RIC of ΦP  is also potentially 
conducive to the reduction in the measurement size. To be 
specific, assume that a threshold τ  of the RIC of ΦP  is 
imposed for a certain performance guarantee. The required δ  
(the RIC of Φ ) determined according to the proposed solution 
(3.25) and the algebraic based estimate (4.2) are, respectively, 
at most

1
τδ τ= + .                                   (4.7) 
It can be verified that the one computed based on our solution 
(i.e., (4.6)) is larger. It is well-known that, with random 
sensing and under a fixed ambient signal dimension p, the 
required number of measurements is inversely proportional to 
2δ  [3]. Hence, our solution guarantees that successful signal 
recovery can be achieved with fewer measurements. As an 
example, let us pick 0.4τ =  (< 2 1 0.414− = ) so that the 
sufficient condition for stable signal reconstruction using 1l -
minimization algorithm [10] holds. By computations, it is 
found that the proposed solution (4.6) yields 0.3208δ = , 
whereas the algebraic based solution (4.7) leads to a 
pessimistic estimate as small as 0.2843δ = . If the entries of 
Φ  are drawn from (0,1/ )mN , where the measurement size 
2( log( / )/ )m O K p K δ∼ ; then, with an overwhelming 
probability, Φ  fulfills the RIP of order K with the prescribed 
RIC δ  [3]. As such, the proposed solution can achieve about a 
21.5%  reduction in the number of measurements. 
 
  To further demonstrate the resultant signal recovery 
performance, we consider two sensing systems both with the 
ambient signal dimension 1000p =  and sparsity level 
20K = ; the numbers of measurements are set to be, 
respectively, 661m =  and 841m =  so that the RIC of the 
sensing matrix Φ  can achieve 0.3208δ =  and 0.2843δ =  
with a high probability. We use the algorithm proposed in [10] 
for signal reconstruction; since the level of the data error must 
be known in the algorithm formulation (see [10]), the sensing 
data mismatch is modeled as a uniform random variable over 
[ , ]σ σ− , where σ  is determined according to the SNR in the 
received data. The cardinality of the desired sparse signal 
vector is fixed to be 5ST = , whereas the cardinality of

recovered SNR as a function of /I ST T  (the background 
SNR is 15 dB). The figure shows that the recovered SNR 
achieved by the two sensing systems are pretty close; as one 
can see, a 21.5%  reduction in the number of measurements 
merely incurs an SNR degradation no more than 0.5 dB. 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Interference is typically a limiting factor of the signal 
recovery performance, and interference cancellation has 
become an indispensable mechanism in many real-world 
communication systems. In this paper, we consider the 
orthogonal-projection based interference cancellation in the 
CS framework, and present an original contribution to the 
study of the achievable RIC of the effective sensing matrix. 
By exploiting geometric characteristics of the orthogonal 
projection and the RIP, we derive an analytic RIC which is 
shown to be tighter than an existing estimate obtained using 
the polarization identity. The tighter solution proposed asserts 
that the signal recovery performance can be potentially better 
than that assessed based on the algebraic-based solution. 
Indeed, by computations about a 5 dB improvement in the 2l  
reconstruction error can be achieved when the RIC of Φ  is 
0.3δ ≈ . Moreover, our result supports that the satisfactory 
signal reconstruction quality specified by an RIC threshold of 
ΦP  can be achieved by a reduced measurement size. 
Particularly, with a Gaussian random sensing matrix, 
computer simulations show that a 21.5%  reduction in the 
amount of measurements merely results in a degradation of the 
recovered signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) smaller than 0.5 dB.
