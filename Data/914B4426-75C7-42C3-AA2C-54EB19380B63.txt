For the acoustic scattering of one elliptical 
cylinder, the proposed results match well with the 
analytical solutions. The proposed scattered fields 
induced by two and three elliptical-cylindrical 
scatterers are critically compared with those 
provided by the boundary element method to validate 
the present method. Finally, the effects of the 
convexity of an elliptical scatterer, the separation 
between scatterers and the incident wave number and 
angle on the acoustic scattering are investigated.

devised by Zaviska [11] and used for the interaction of waves with arrays of circular 
cylinders by Linton and Evans [12]. The addition theorem is often employed to 
transform the multipole expansion into one of the coordinate systems to satisfy the 
specified boundary conditions. In the case of the circular boundary, some applications 
can be seen in the water wave scattering problem [12], the free vibration of circular 
membranes [13] and circular plates [14], flexural wave scattering [15] and scattering 
from multiple spheres [16] where the matrices of the T-matrix method were calculated 
using the addition theorem of spherical wave functions. For the elliptical boundary, 
applications involve the scattering of sound wave [4-6] and the hydrodynamic 
diffraction [7] using the addition theorem of the Mathieu functions derived from 
Graf’s addition theorem for the Bessel functions. From a mathematical perspective, 
the procedure is elegant. However, we need to face a difficult formulation and the 
accompanying complicated numerical calculations due to the infinite series form of 
the addition theorem for Mathieu functions, limiting its applications. 
This paper presents a semi-analytical approach to the acoustic scattering induced by 
multiple elliptical-cylindrical scatterers. To satisfy the Helmholtz equation in the 
elliptical coordinate system, the scattering field is represented by expansions in 
Mathieu functions. By uniformly collocating points on the boundaries, the normal 
derivative of the acoustic pressure at the collocation point is exactly calculated by 
using the directional derivative with respect to each coordinate system to satisfy the 
Neumann boundary conditions (or sound-hard conditions). In this way, a coupled 
infinite system of simultaneous linear algebraic equations is derived and the scattered 
field can then be determined according to the given incident acoustic wave. Once the 
total field is calculated as the sum of the incident field and the scattered field, the near 
field acoustic pressure along the scatterers and the far field scattering pattern can be 
determined. It is worth mentioning that the proposed method is applicable to 
electromagnetic scattering [17] or scattering of water wave [7] without any substantial 
change as elliptical cylinders are of interest in fields such as electromagnetics and 
hydrodynamics.

To determine these unknown coefficients, the calculation of Eq. (18) or (19) is 
needed. But this procedure involves the derivative of multivariable functions and this 
is not an easy task. The addition theorem is known to be capable of solving this 
problem [7]. However, the addition theorem of Mathieu functions makes the 
formulation and the corresponding numerical calculation complicated due to its 
infinite series form. In this paper, Eq. (18) or (19) is calculated without requiring the 
addition theorem of Mathieu functions. To achieve this, two difficulties must be 
surmounted. One is the determination of elliptical coordinates with respect to different 
local coordinate systems. The other is how to calculate the normal derivative of 
Mathieu functions with respect to different local coordinate systems.

To calculate the gjA  of Eq. (25), two tasks need to be done: one is the 
determination the elliptical coordinates ( ,gn gnj j  ) of the collocation point. When g=j, 
the elliptical coordinates ( ,gn gng g  ) can be easily determined by uniformly distributing 
collocation points along the gth elliptical boundary. On the other hand, when g j, the 
elliptical coordinates ( ,gn gnj j  ) can be determined from the coordinates ( ,gn gng g  ) 
through the coordinate transformation. At first the rectangular coordinates in the gth 
coordinate system are determined from the elliptical ones by Eq. (4) as follows: 
cosh( )gn gn gn gng g g gx iy f i    . (26)
and the rectangular coordinates with respect to the jth local system can then be 
transformed from the gth local system by

Finally, the normal derivative with respect to any local elliptical coordinate system 
can be exactly calculated without any truncation problem, which inevitably occurred 
when using the addition theorem. When g=j in Eq. (34),  gng  equals to gng , the 
parameter   becomes zero and Eq. (35) can then be reduced to Eq. (29).  
After determining the element of the linear algebraic system, these unknown 
coefficients, {d}, can be determined by solving Eq. (23) and the total field as well as 
the scattered field can then be obtained from Eqs. (18) and (16). 
5 Numerical results and discussions 
To demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, based on the formulation 
mentioned in the previous section, a FORTRAN code was implemented to study the 
acoustic wave scattered by multiple elliptical cylinders and to determine the near-field 
acoustic pressure and the far-field scattering pattern. The code was developed by 
using the subroutines of the Mathieu function provided by Zhang and Jin [19]. In the 
following numerical experiments, we investigate the acoustic scattering by one, two 
and three elliptical cylinders in an unbounded acoustic medium. For the case of one 
elliptical cylinder, the present method is compared with the available analytical 
method [18] and the BEM [2]. For two and three elliptical cylinders, the present 
results are critically compared with those provided by the BEM [2]. Considering the 
sound-soft and sound-hard boundary conditions, the convergence analysis was first 
conducted to determine the proper number of terms in the multipole expansion to 
achieve the accurate results. Next, the effects of the configuration of elliptical 
scatterers and the incident wave on the acoustic scattering were investigated. 
Case 1. Acoustic scattering by one elliptical cylinder 
An unbounded acoustic medium with a sound-hard elliptical cylinder of a=1.0 and 
b=0.5 subjected to an incident sound wave with  =0 was first considered. The radial 
coordinate of its boundary 1  is constant, 0.5493, and the interfocal distance 2f is 
1.732. Figure 3 shows the acoustic pressure on an elliptical boundary, at -π/2η= , 
 12
Case 2. Acoustic scattering by two elliptical cylinders 
Consider two identical sound-hard elliptical cylinders of a=1.0 and b=0.5 with 
different dimensionless separation s/a subjected to an incident sound wave with  =0. 
The dimensionless separation of two scatterers is denoted by s/a where the separation 
s is equal to L-2b and the parameter L is the central distance of the two scatterers. 
Shown in Fig.9 is the acoustic pressure on the upper elliptical boundary ( -π/2η= ) 
versus the dimensionless incident wave number when using different numbers of 
terms when s/a=0.1. Compared with the result of one scatterer, the more number of 
terms is required even when the incident wave number is small. To achieve the same 
accuracy as the case of one scatterer, the required number of terms increases slightly 
to 14 due to the small value of s/a. The deviations of the two methods from the 
present method are shown in Fig.10, where the solid line represents the BEM+CHIEF 
and the dotted line the BEM. As stated previously, the results of the BEM without 
CHIEF show significant error at the fictitious frequencies. As s/a increases to 1.0, the 
convergence results, shown in Fig. 11, are similar to the case of one scatterer. 
For s/a=0.1 and  =0, Fig. 12 shows the acoustic pressure on the boundary (at 
-π/2η= ) of the upper sound-hard elliptical cylinder of a=1.0 as a function of the 
dimensionless incident wave number when considering three different geometric 
shapes, where the solid line represents 0 = 1.5, the dashed line 0 = 0.5, and the 
dotted line 0 = 0.1. In general, the flat scatterer has a small response due to  =0. 
However, it is interesting to note that a maximum of acoustic pressure appears on the 
flat scatterer when the incident wave number ka=1.7. For ka=1.0 and  =0, Fig. 13 
shows the acoustic pressure on the upper elliptical boundary at -π/2η= as a function 
of the dimensionless separation s/a. As stated previously, the flat scatterer has a small 
response. As the dimensionless separation s/a varies, the oscillation behavior of the 
acoustic pressure is observed and the period of this oscillation depends on the incident 
wave number. This phenomenon also occurs in flexural wave scattering and the detail 
can be seen in [22].  
Case 3. Acoustic scattering by three elliptical cylinders 
An unbounded acoustic medium with three identical elliptical cylinders of 
interfocal length 2f=2 subjected to an incident sound wave was considered. Two 
different arrangements are shown in Fig.14: (a) a straight array and (b) a circular 
 14
same as the incident wave and the side scattering in the pattern shows an obvious 
increase. When the incident angle  =4 /3, the patterns are symmetric about the axis 
at the angle of 4 /3. The patterns for kR=0.5 are given on the upper left side of Fig. 
19, and the patterns for kR= on the lower right side. It indicates that as the 
separation increases, the forward and side scattering are both evident. 
6. Conclusions 
Acoustic wave scattered by multiple elliptical cylinders in an unbounded medium 
was rigorously solved by using the collocation multipole method. The angular and 
radial Mathieu functions are employed to represent the scattering field that satisfies 
the Helmholtz equation in the elliptical coordinate system and the radiation condition 
at infinity. Instead of using the addition theorem for the Mathieu functions, the normal 
derivative of the acoustic pressure is calculated using the appropriate directional 
derivative in the multiply-connected domain problem. The proposed algorithm has a 
concise formulation without requiring complicated numerical calculations caused by 
the infinite series form of the addition theorem. The proposed results are critically 
compared with those of the available analytical method and the BEM. It follows from 
several numerical experiments that the accuracy of the present method is superior to 
that of the BEM and that fictitious frequencies are not found in our formulation. The 
effects of the geometric shape of an elliptical scatterer, the separation between 
scatterers and the incident wave number and angle on the near-field acoustic pressure 
and the far-field scattering pattern are extensively investigated. It may be worth 
mentioning that the proposed method can be extended to problems with smoothly 
varying boundaries. They are among our further research goals.

Natural mode analysis of elliptical cylindrical cavities with multiple elliptical cylinders by using 
the collocation multipole method

Summary The eigenproblem is solved by the collocation multipole method. The multipole expansion is formulated in terms of Mathieu 
functions to deal with elliptical boundaries. The direct searching approach is employed to determine the natural frequencies by using the 
singular value decomposition (SVD). The accuracy and numerical convergence is validated by comparison with the commercial finite-
element code ABAQUS. Excellent accuracy and fast rate of convergence are the key features thanks to its semi-analytical feature. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The natural mode analysis of an acoustic cavity can provide important information in the design phase for the cavity 
related to mechanical systems such as automobile mufflers and hermetic compressors. Although numerical methods 
such as finite element methods (FEM) and boundary element methods (BEM) can solve these problems, analytical 
solutions, if available, usually result in accurate and fast-rate convergence and provide physical insight for the problem 
being considered. Consequently, a semi-analytical approach to the eigenproblem for a 3D acoustic cavity with elliptical 
boundaries is presented in this paper. 
The concept of the multipole method to solve multiply connected domain problems was firstly devised by Zaviska  and 
used for the interaction of waves with arrays of circular cylinders by Linton and Evans. The addition theorem is often 
employed to transform the multipole expansion into one of coordinate systems for satisfying the specified boundary 
conditions. For the circular boundary, some applications can be seen in the literature, including the water wave 
scattering problem, the free vibration problem of circular membranes, the free vibration problem of circular plates and 
the flexural wave scattering problem. Furthermore, Chatjigeorgiou et al. proposed an analytical approach to the 
hydrodynamic diffraction by multiple elliptical cylinders using the addition theorem of the Mathieu functions. In the 
view point of mathematics, the procedure is exact and elegant. But we need to face the complicated formulation and the 
associated numerical calculation due to its complicated form for the addition theorem. Moreover, the usage of the 
addition theorem limits its application to the problem with canonical boundaries such as a circle or ellipse.   
This paper presents a collocation multipole method to solve the eigenproblem of a three-dimensional acoustic cavity 
with a multiply connected domain. Instead of using the addition theorem, the multipole method will be extended to the 
problems with elliptic boundaries by uniformly collocating points on the boundaries to satisfy the boundary conditions. 
The normal derivatives at the collocation points are exactly calculated by using the directional derivative in each 
coordinate system. In this way, a coupled finite linear algebraic system is derived. For the eigenproblem, based on the 
direct searching approach, the nontrivial eigenvalues can be found by detecting the zero determinant of the linear 
system through the technique of singular value decomposition (SVD). The solution accuracy and computing efficiency 
of the proposed results are to be compared critically with those of available analytic solutions and such numerical 
method as the FEM
