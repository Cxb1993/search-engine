摘要 
本實驗主要目的在於探討利用沈澱-微過濾程序去除與回收光電業蝕刻廢水中磷酸鹽之可行性。使用鈣
鹽作為沈澱劑，控制酸鹼值與濃度莫耳比於最適當操作條件下，分析廢水中磷酸鹽之移除率與分析沉
澱物組成，探討磷酸鹽回收再利用之潛力。並結合掃流微過濾進一步分離溶液中固體與液體。探討改
變沈澱過程中之酸鹼值與濃度莫耳比、過濾壓力、掃流速度與不同薄膜種類等變因，對濾速的影響。 
 結果顯示，控制酸鹼值在 8.5 至 10.5 之間，過量的鈣鹽可移除 96%以上的磷酸鹽。利用 X 光繞射
分析得知，沈澱物主要以結晶的氫氧基磷灰石(hydroxyapatite, HAP)及非結晶磷酸鹽(amorphous calcium 
phosphate, ACP)為優勢物種。然而因為蝕刻廢水中含有少量的氟，亦會有少量的氟化鈣與氟化磷灰石
(fluorapatite, FAP)存在於沈澱物中。此實驗使用電腦軟體 PHREEQC 計算理論的熱力學平衡，將模擬出
的值與實驗結果做比較。以微過濾處理經加鈣沈澱過後之廢水，可有效地分離溶液中固體與液體。以
不同條件沈澱後進行過濾，在酸鹼值為 8.5 時，有較明顯的堵塞現象。使用不同孔徑的薄膜進行過濾，
可發現較大的孔徑（0.45μm）雖然能有較高的初始濾速，但也會造成較嚴重的堵塞。而改變操作壓力
與掃流速度發現，當操作壓力與掃流速度越大時，可得到較高的初始濾速與穩定濾速。使用疏水性薄
膜時，發現改變操作壓力與掃流速度對穩定濾速的影響並不明顯，但所造成的堵塞現象較親水性薄膜
嚴重。在所有過濾程序中，濾餅是主要的過濾阻力。使用沈澱-微過濾程序可有效去除磷酸鹽、濁度與
總懸浮固體，不僅過濾後水質可達放流水標準，所生成之沈澱物也具有很高的潛力回收再利用。

Abstract 
The removal of phosphate and fluoride from thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) wastewater 
by a hybrid precipitation-microfiltration (MF) process was studied. Calcium salt was used to form precipitates, 
followed by crossflow MF for solid-liquid separation. The results showed that excess calcium could induce 
effective removal of phosphate and fluoride at pH 8.5 and 10.5. The dominant solids were hydroxyapatite 
(Ca5(PO4)3OH, HAP), amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F, FAP), and calcium 
fluoride (CaF2). Precipitation conditions affected the MF, and more significant fouling was found at pH 8.5 
than pH 10.5. Permeate analysis showed increased removal of phosphate and fluoride in MF, and effective 
removal of turbidity. The initial flux and steady state flux increased with increasing filtration pressure and 
crossflow velocity. The main fouling resistance was cake resistance. This study demonstrated that the hybrid 
precipitation-MF process could effectively remove phosphate and fluoride from wastewater, and produce 
filtrate and precipitates for potential recovery and reuse.

2. Materials and methods 
    The wastewater was collected from a TFT-LCD manufacturing company in Taiwan. It was sampled from 
the equalization tank of the inorganic wastewater. The pH was 4.72 and conductivity was 424 µS/cm. Its solid 
content was very low, with total suspended solid (TSS) of 0.58 mg/L and turbidity of 14.4 NTU. It contained 
187.6 mg/L of phosphate (PO43-), 19.53 mg/L of fluoride (F-), 34.15 mg/L of sulfate (SO42-), and 28.06 mg/L 
of nitrate (NO3-) as analyzed by ion chromatography (DIONEX-1000). The regeneratant and eluent used was 1 
mM sulfuric acid and 6 mM sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3), 
respectively. Each sample was first filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane (PVDF), and then filled into a 2 mL 
brown glass bottle before analysis. The other componets included 38.29 mg/L of sodium, 3.22 mg/L of 
calcium, and 0.68 mg/L of aluminum as measured by inductively coupled plasma – atomic emission 
spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, ICP-AES JY2000).  
The chemical precipitation experiments were conducted in batch-mode by a jar-test apparatus. The 
measured volume of stock solution of calcium chloride (0.51 M CaCl2‧2H2O) was added to the beaker that 
contained 1L of wastewater in each beaker. Molar ratio of calcium to phosphate and fluoride, ([Ca+2]: [PO43-]: 
[F-]) was controlled at 1.5:1:0.7 and 2.5:1:0.7, respectively. The pH was controlled at 8.5 and 10.5, 
respectively. After adding calcium chloride, the wastewater was rapidly mixed at 200 rpm for 3 minutes and 
the pH was adjusted to desired value using 1N NaOH or 1N HCl. The speed was then adjusted to 50 rpm for 
30 minutes, and the pH of the mixture was determined. The wastewater was subject to 30-min sedimentation 
or MF process afterwards for subsequent separation of solid from water. 
. To determine particle size distribution of precipitates, 500 mL of wastewater after subject to chemical 
precipitation was measured by a small angle light scattering instrument (Malvern Mastersizer 2000). Crystal 
structure of precipitates was analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, D/Max-RC) after precipitates were 
dried, ground into powder form, and made as a pellet. The second method was by wet chemical analysis, in 
which a portion of precipitate was separated from 200 mL of solution by filtration. The solid was dried in a 
dessicator with silica gel under room temperature for 48 hour, weighed and then dissolved in 5 mL of 2N 
HNO3, and transferred to a 250-mL volumetric flask. The volumetric flask was filled up to 250 mL with 
distilled water. The solution was mixed with a stirring bar for 1 hour, and analyzed for Ca, PO4 and F 
concentration with aforementioned analytical procedures. 
The saturation indices and the distribution of aqueous species under equilibrium conditions as affected by 
calcium concentration and pH were simulated by the PHREEQC Interactive 2.8 software. The possible species 
considered in modeling included hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH, HAP), amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), 
octacalcium phosphate (Ca4H(PO4)3‧2.5H2O, OCP), monetite (CaHPO4, DCPA), brushite (CaHPO4‧2H2O, 
DCPD), fluorapatite (FAP), and calcium fluoride (CaF2). 
After precipitation, the suspension was subject to MF for 100 min. A schematic diagram of the MF 
system used in the study is shown in Figure 1. The wastewater was stirred in a slurry tank to ensure that there 
is no solids settled in the tank. The temperature of the suspension was maintained at 250C. It was pumped by a 
peristaltic pump, and a rotameter was used to monitor crossflow velocity. Mixed cellulose ester hydrophilic 
(MCE) membranes with pore size of 0.22 and 0.45 µm was used, respectively. The membrane was immersed 
in water and alcohol, respectively, to ensure the maximum wettability. The filtration procedure was repeated 
 found between the modeled and experimental results.  
When using calcium salt to treat wastewater that contains phosphate and fluoride, the interactions of 
phosphate and fluoride have been well documented [1-3, 17]. The calcium salt could react with fluoride and 
phosphate to form precipitates of HAP, FAP, and CaF2. From both simulated and experimental results, a 
certain fraction of fluoride was removed. The results were in agreement with previous results that higher than 
stoichiometric amount of calcium is required to ensure effective removal of fluoride, and calcium tends to 
react with phosphate preferentially than fluoride under alkaline pH [17]. Figure 2 shows XRD patterns of 
precipitates formed at different pH and different molar ratio. It was found that the dominant phase of 
precipitate was dependent on the pH. For example, at pH 8.5 and molar ratio of 1.5:1:0.7, HAP and FAP were 
the two dominant phases found; while the formation of CaF2 was confirmed as the molar ratio increased to 
2.5:1:0.7 at pH 8.5. Broad peaks typical of amorphous materials were found among precipitates formed at pH 
10.5 regardless of molar ratio. The probable precipitate formed was amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). 
Data from wet chemical analysis of precipitates are depicted in Figure 3. The normalized concentration 
ratio of Ca, PO4, and F in the precipitates as affected by initial molar ratio and pH is compared with PO4 
concentration set as 1. It was found that the ratio of Ca to PO4 in precipitate was 1.63 at initial molar ratio of 
1.5:1:0.7 and was independent of pH. It was approximately equal to the stoichiometric ratio of HAP (Ca/P: 
1.67). It implied that HAP was the dominant phase with traces of other precipitates, such as CaF2 and OCP 
(Ca/P: 1.33). When at molar ratio of 2.5:1:0.7 the ratio of Ca to PO4 in precipitate was 1.88 and 1.98 at pH 8.5 
and 10.5, respectively. This ratio was higher than HAP, and the possible explanation was that Ca(OH)2 was 
formed and contributed to Ca fraction in the precipitates. In addition, the ratio in precipitate at pH 10.5 was 
higher than that at pH 8.5, probably because ACP was formed. Since HAP is known to have slow reaction rate 
and a number of species, such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and octacalcium phosphate (OCP) act 
as precursors of HAP [16]. This again confirmed that three precipitates, HAP, FAP, and CaF2, were formed. 
Figure 4 shows the distribution of particle size (number-based) under different conditions. The particles were 
mostly very fine when formed at pH 8.5 regardless of molar ratio. The median particle size was 0.72 and 0.71 
μm, respectively. Larger particles were formed when at pH 10.5, and median particle size was 8.74 and 2.46
μm, respectively at two different molar ratio. The volume-based median particle size was > 21.2 µm under 
different precipitation conditions.  
  
3.2 Microfiltration of precipitated wastewater 
MF experiments were first conducted under laminar flow region (us=0.48 m/s) and filtration pressure of 
0.5 bar. Table 2 shows the filtration flux under various precipitation conditions. When at molar ratio 
(Ca:PO4:F) of 1.5:1:0.7, the initial flux and steady state flux was 1,710 and 254 L/m2h at pH 8.5; and 2,610 
and 225 L/m2h at pH 10.5, respectively. At molar ratio of 2.5:1:0.7, the initial flux and steady state flux was 
2,250 and 330 L/m2h at pH 8.5; 2,790 and 285 L/m2h at pH 10.5, respectively. The flux loss (%) was 
calculated by the difference in pure water flux of original membrane and of used membrane after washing. It 
was found that the flux loss at pH 8.5 was higher than those at pH 10.5. It was probably caused by membrane 
fouling of fine (< 1 μm) calcium phosphate or calcium fluoride precipitates at pH 8.5, as smaller particles 
tend to produce higher fouling than larger particles in crossflow filtration [18]. The specific resistances, 
including Rm, Rf, and Rc, derived from MF of wastewater are depicted in Figure 5. It shows that cake 
 various operation conditions are shown in Table 7. The effects of filtration pressure and crossflow velocity on 
the membrane showed similar trends with those of the membrane with pore size of 0.22 µm. In general, the 
higher flux was found when using membrane with larger pore size. However, higher flux loss was found as 
well. The steady state flux increased with increasing filtration pressure and crossflow velocity. In addition, it 
was found that the flux loss decreased when increasing crossflow velocity or filtration pressure. The cake 
resistance was still the dominant one that caused flux decline. The increased crossflow velocity could reduce 
the total resistance slightly. The increased filtration pressure not only resulted in higher steady state flux but 
also higher cake resistance.  
 
3.5 Overall assessment 
A large amount of wastewater containing phosphate and fluoride is produced in TFT-LCD manufacturing. 
From experimental results shown above, both phosphate and fluoride could be effectively removed using 
chemical precipitation as long as molar ratio and pH were properly controlled. The introduction of MF had 
several advantages when compared with conventional processes. MF has smaller foot print, and higher 
removal efficiency of phosphate and fluoride was found when compared with conventional processes. More 
effective solid-water separation was obtained without adding coagulant, and the filtrate could potentially be 
reclaimed and reused since it did not contain organic matters and its turbidity was low. The precipitates could 
potentially be reused as raw material in fertilizer industry.     
 
4. Conclusions 
A hybrid precipitation-MF process was utilized to remove phosphate and fluoride from TFT-LCD 
wastewater. The effects of molar ratio and pH on chemical precipitation were studied and compared with 
model predictions. The effects of operation pressure and crossflow velocity on filtration flux, permeate quality, 
and membrane fouling characteristics were examined in MF experiments. The following results were obtained: 
1. Molar ratio (Ca:PO4:F) and pH had significant effect on the precipitation reactions of calcium with 
phosphate and fluoride. Higher than stoichiometric amount of calcium is required to ensure effective removal 
of phosphate and fluoride, and calcium tended to react with phosphate preferentially than fluoride at alkaline 
pH. In addition, higher removal efficiency for both PO4 and F was found at pH 10.5. The model predicts the 
formation of HAP, FAP, and CaF2, and was confirmed by instrumental analysis and wet chemical analysis.  
2. The very fine (< 1 μm) particles were formed at pH 8.5, which led to higher fouling resistance and 
higher flux loss. The initial flux and steady state flux increased with increasing filtration pressure and 
crossflow velocity. The main fouling resistance was cake resistance among all MF experiment. The specific 
cake resistance and cake mass per unit filtration area value increased with increasing filtration pressure and 
decreased with increasing crossflow velocity. 
3. The hybrid precipitation-MF process showed higher removal efficiency of turbidity, phosphate, and 
fluoride. Advantages of the hybrid precipitation-MF process included effective phosphate and fluoride 
removal from the wastewater, effective solid/water separation, smaller foot print, and potential reuse of HAP 
and FAP.
