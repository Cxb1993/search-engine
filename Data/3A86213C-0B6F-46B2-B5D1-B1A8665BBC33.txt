Up to now, the LED driving methods are most based on 
the persistence of vision, and nobody to care about 
other important human vision characteristics. We will 
adopt the medical research results on the human 
vision characteristic to build up the human light 
sensation model for LED driving applications. Based 
on the model, optimized LED driving methods will be 
discussed, and high performance LED driver can be 
verified also. A human factor lux meter will also be 
developed to measure the correct saving energy 
ability.

半導體光源除節能貢獻外，開關動作的迅速反應是其殊有的特徵。本計畫是研究如何
將此項特徵合理地配合人類之視覺生理特徵，設計適於人類使用的半導體光源照明系統驅

人類的視覺系統特性，主要有兩個因子，即空間對比敏感度與時間對比敏感度。空間

參、 計畫緣由與目的： 
 
本計畫預期設計LED用於照明的驅動方法。經由人類視覺生理資料，推演出用於不
同環境、角度、用途的照明驅動方法。工業界所採用的調光驅動以PWM為主。過去研
究的驅動方法中，有主張定頻於1kHz與duty 60%以及驅動電流定於30mA可得最高效
率、1kHz 與duty 80% 最大額定電流70mA下可得到與直流驅動最為相近、60Hz與duty 
95%下與施加直流電壓時相比，人眼感受到的亮度約為2倍。 
以上的研究均提供了一定的重要性。若回歸到照明終究是人類使用的主題上，屏除
光學光場等設計單純討論到人類視覺效應時，1kHz下的驅動方式並沒有受到嚴格檢視是
否適用，是否有比1kHz更加適合人眼的驅動存在。且以上種種做法，僅是實驗結果。而
且在實驗設計上並未完善，忽略了許多人類視覺生理特徵和環境因素，也沒有確實的理
論根據。 
基於此，本計畫將整理人類視覺生理反應的醫學數據與理論，並依據統整後的結果
進行實驗，尋找最適合的驅動方式。 
我們希望達到以下目標： 
1. 利用數學方法解析過往實驗資料，搭配不同的環境參數，建立通用的人類視覺
數學模型。 
2. 根據數學模型，設計適用於人類照明用LED驅動電路。 
 
肆、 成果自評： 
 
一、 研究創見上之自評： 
 
計畫首先將已設計完成的驅動方法，與直流驅動下的狀態作比較。如 Fig. 1 所示，
這是我們發展 LED 驅動電路的起點。圖中以 7 個白光 LED 為一串，VC1 是 7 個白光
LED 的 Vf 值，VC2 是 7 個白光 LED 的 Vcut值，D1 控制 VC1 之偏壓，D2 控制 VC2 之
偏壓。以7個白光LED為一串而言，VC1約為23.1(7*3.3=23.1)伏，VC2約為9.1 (7*1.3=9.1) 
伏。當 PWM 為 High 時，電晶體 Q1 與 Q2 均導通，使 VC1 通過 D1 點亮 LED。當 PWM
為 Low 時 Q2 不導通連帶使 Q1 不導通，LED 上將由 D2 控制通過 VC2 的電壓維持 PN
間通道的續流。但，不關掉 7 個白光 LED。方波驅動的情況之下，其電壓施用情形如
Fig. 2 所示。 
 
 5
 
Fig. 3 AC 正弦波全波驅動的情況之下電壓施用情形 
 
 
那麼，為什麼需要設計要有保護電壓的電路？在過去與視覺有關的研究中很少探討
到驅動電路本身的合理設計。在 PWM 的高低壓變化中，使 LED 在反覆的在零電壓與
導通電壓間變化，將導致 PN 介面大量之電子或電洞的來回移動，進而造成熱累積。 
為了理解 LED 驅動電壓隨時間變化下的情形，較早我們進行過交流驅動的實驗。
首先進行的是以 LED 建立成電橋並使用 AC 直接驅動。觀察紀錄下的波形如 Fig. 3 所
示，圖中黑線為電流波形而藍線為電壓波形。原本應該隨著電壓變化的電流波形，在全
波交流電壓抵達換相點的時候呈現為零。若採用的驅動為交流市電，則 LED 燈組產生
的閃爍頻率為 60Hz，在某些使用者環境下將產生閃爍感。

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1 System Architecture 
The proposed LED display panel architecture is show in figure1. Since MCU is easier to develop and MCU is much 
cheaper than any other control unit, it is used as a main controller in the driver circuit. MCU can control three pieces of 
LED driver IC – HT1632C. They are separately controlled by serial communication through four control signals, WR, 
RD, DATA and CS Enable, where CS0, CS1, CS2 are used for enabling the first, the second , the third HT1632C, 
respectively. In this experiment, the used LED display panel size 24 Rows and 16 columns, because the maximum 
resolution of one piece HT1632C is 24 by 16. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. System architecture 
 
With the technological advances of IC design, many IC designers try to find the solution to solve the problem of LED 
display panel driver. The LED Driver IC HT1632C is a typical example. The HT1632C is a memory mapping LED 
display controller/driver, which can select either in 32 by 8 or 24 by 16 working mode. A serial interface is conveniently 
provided for transfer command and data. The display can be extended by cascading the HT1632C for larger size 
applications. As the HT1632C provides totally common sink current of 250mA, and it can directly drive LED panels and 
does therefore not require external current boost transistors thus reducing cost. 
Although the maximum resolution of one piece HT1632C is 24 by 16, the proposed system architecture will use three 
pieces of HT1632C to drive a 24 by 16 seven-color display panel. The seven different colors are mixed from selecting 
one of the three colors, red, green or blue color. Each one color is controlled by a HT1632C. Since carefully do the 
combination of three colors, we can get seven colors in the display board as listed in Table 1. In each active period, if 
only one HT1632C is activated then one of three original colors (red, green blue) is shown, and if two or more of the 
HT1632Cs are enabled in the same time period, the LED can show mixed color like yellow, purple, aquamarine and 
white. With this design methodology, LED can be very easy used to show seven colors. 
 
Proc. of SPIE Vol. 8120  81200M-2
  
2.3 HT1632C display method 
For easy to explain, all the display objects (data, or figure, or image) are called images. The HT1632C is a Memory 
Mapping LED display driver device. Taking this advantage, we can conveniently mapping image to the display data ram. 
Using a Memory Mapping LED driver for the image display is equal to execute a logic writing operation to the LED 
RAM. Each pixel in the image frame has a corresponding data unit in the MCU memory. The image display function of 
the HT1632C is to receive data from data unit in the MCU memory to the mapped RAM of the LED driver. The 
corresponding relation between the LED matrix dots (image pixels) and the LED RAM used in a single HT1632C is 
shown in figure3.  
 
 Figure 3. The corresponding relation between the LED matrix dots and the LED RAM 
 
In order to transfer data from MCU ram to LED ram as fast as possible, the creation of image data should be done in 
such a way that makes identically with the LED RAM and LED matrix dots. For example, the intersection of COM7 and 
OUT0 corresponds to bit 3 of the address 01H. The intersection of COM4 and OUT0 corresponds to bit 0 of the address 
01H. The intersection of COM3 and OUT0 corresponds to bit 3 of the address 00H. The intersection of COM0 and 
OUT0 corresponds to bit 0 of the address 00H. The address bits of 01H and 00H form an 8-bit data unit. When creating 
image data, MSB (the highest bit), bit7, should correspond to bit3 of 01H and the lowest bit, bit0, should correspond to 
bit 0 of 00H. MCU should make the space as image RAM, the space size is 48 bytes. For example of driving the 
common anode LED, to cause the LED is not light at ROW0 and COM0 to COM3, and that is light at ROW0 and COM4 
to COM7. MCU need to write the binary data of 11110000 to the LED RAM address at 00 and 01.In this way, it will be 
more convenient to write image data into the LED RAM afterwards. 
2.4 Static image display 
To show seven-color image on the 24 by 16 display panel, the MCU should offer 2 by 48 bytes memory spaces. The first 
48 bytes memory space is used to store the image’s display data, and the second 48 bytes memory space is used to store

COIl UI
 
 
To move an image from right to left, MCU should deal with the data twice and deal with 24 bytes of data each time. The 
process of MCU deal the data is shown in Figure 5. First, MCU should create two registers, temp and counter, then 
making the counter value equal 0 and the temp value equal the image data of first byte. Second, all 24 bytes data is 
sequentially shifted forward one until final byte, such as the Image[0] is equaled Image[1] and Image[1] is equaled 
Image[2]…. Finally, making the final byte equals the temp register. Following this process a new image data can be 
prepared, and the image data is shit one line. MCU constantly updated with information on the process shown in Figure 5, 
and then writing data with the process of Figure 4 to LED RAM to get dynamic effect. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Processing of MCU image RAM update 
 
To move an image from bottom to top is different from that of an image moving from right to left. This method is that 
each time before data is to be written to the RAM, the data must first be managed. For example, for one line if the data to 
be displayed is 10011001B, then the image be moved from the bottom to the top. First move the 10011001B data to the 
right 7-bit. Moved right the higher bits will be filled in as 0. Therefore the data becomes 00000001B. This data is written 
to the LED RAM. In the image all data is managed in this way. The image will be displayed starting from the lowest line. 
To display the lowest two line contents, then move the original data to the right by 6 bits with the higher bits being filled 
in as 0. Now the data will be 00000010B. This data is written to the LED RAM. In this way the lowest two line contents 
can be displayed. When the picture has been moved to the topmost position, then no more moving is required and the 
data can be directly written to the LED RAM. 
2.6 Expansion of LED board 
The proposed system architecture is using three pieces of HT1632C to compose a driver circuit to drive a LED display 
panel of the size 24 by 16. To expand a group of multi-connected LED panel, the system just need to increase a 
combination of HT1632C, one set by one set. In the case of Expands, MCU need to provide four I/O signals: CSi_0, 
Proc. of SPIE Vol. 8120  81200M-6
  
from right to left, left to right, bottom to top and top to bottom. The fastest time of moving picture is the same as the time 
showing a picture by static display, it is nearly 165 milliseconds.

4. METHODOLOGY COMPARE 
4.1 Comparison with MCU control circuit and combinational circuit  
At current stage, the most LED billboards production lines are using MCU to control the combination logic circuit to do 
scanning works. For driving a size 16 by 16 LED matrix, the driving circuit need to have six pieces of eight bit shift 
registers, eight bit latch buffer, 3-to-8 decoder and 8 bit Darlington current sink IC. The total quantity of used IC reaches 
24 pieces. So many ICs are used that the driving circuit becomes very complex and the cost is also very high. In addition, 
the scan process is under control of MCU. The MCU becomes very busy and can’t do other tasks, waste many 
computation resources. 
Here we use a low cost MCU to let three pieces of HT1632C to do the scanning jobs. The hardware circuit is greatly 
simplified because of only three ICs are used. The hardware cost is cheaper than that of using combinational logic circuit 
which uses twenty four logic ICs. Since the HT1632C can automatically scan LED matrix with a frame rate of 62Hz, 
with the active scanning, the workload performed by MCU can be greatly reduced. The total software work loading is 
also reduced.  Then, the MCU have more resources to be exploited. Compared to the traditional design method of using 
combinational logic, the proposed method not only reduces the production cost, but also simplifies the hardware and 
software works.  
 
4.2 Comparison with FPGA and CPLD 
There are two common approaches for using FPGA and CPLD as the design elements to design the LED billboards. The 
one is using FPGA or CPLD only to do scanning jobs. In this case, MCU sends display data to FPGA, which will then 
scan the LED matrix. The action function is quite similar to the approach reported in previous sections. But they still 
have some differences. For FPGA design methodology, it has the advantages of processing display data in high speed, 
and the LED displayed image can with gray scale, thus, the panel shows image with much more colors. In addition, the 
effect of using gray scale for LED is not good for the low pixel LED billboard. In a word, Cost is always the most 
important issue in public market domain. The cost of FPGA is more expensive than that of driving circuit built with

ABSTRACT   
Saving energy, White-light LED plays a main role in solid state lighting system. Find the best energy saving driven 
solution is the engineer endless hard work. Besides DC and AC driving, LED using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) 
operation is also a valuable research topic. The most important issue for this work is to find the drive frequency and duty 
for achieving both energy saving and better feeling on the human vision sensation. In this paper, psychophysics of 
human vision response to the lighting effect, including Persistence of vision, Bloch's Law, Broca-Sulzer Law, 
Ferry-Porter Law, Talbot-Plateau Law, and Contrast Sensitivity, will be discussed and analyzed.  
From the human vision system, we found that there are three factors: the flash sensitivity, the illumination intensity and 
the background environment illumination, that are used to decide the frequency and duty of the PWM driving method. A 
set of controllable LED lamps with adjustable frequency and duty is fitted inside a non-closed box is constructed for this 
experiment.  
When the background environment illumination intensity is high, the variation of the flash sensitivity and illumination 
intensity is not easy to observe. Increasing PWM frequency will eliminate flash sensitivity. When the duty is over 70%, 
the vision sensitivity is saturated. For warning purpose, the better frequency range is between 7Hz to 15Hz and the duty 
cycle can be lower down to 70%. For general lighting, the better frequency range is between 200Hz to 1000Hz and the 
duty cycle can also be lower down to 70%.

1. INTRODUCTION  
General lighting consumes about 18% in the whole world energy. Improving lighting system efficiency will save energy 
and reduce carbon emissions. The energy saving issue becomes the most widely research topic.  
White-light LED (WLED) is generally driven by using DC power. To save more energy, PWM (Pulse-width modulation) 
is a feasible technique. PWM is a period square wave voltage, with two parameters namely frequency and duty. 
Frequency is the number of period waves per second, and duty is high voltage part in a square wave in proportion, 
sometimes also call duty ON, the low voltage in square wave call duty OFF. At the duty ON period, the LED lamp is lit. 
While during duty OFF, the LED lamp has no power. 
To find the best driving frequency, we need to connect the phenomenon of Psychophysics of vision and PWM control 
technique. Many researchers keep on working in this topic. In [1], the result shows that set frequency to 1000 hertz and 
duty equals to 60%, then the best luminescence efficiency of white LED will be obtained. In [2], they got the same effect 
as DC driving by setting frequency of PWM to 1K hertz, and the duty cycle equal to 80%. 
These are important results. However, many physiological characteristics of human vision and environmental factor are 
been ignored. Besides, there is no exact theoretical basis to support the experimental result. After all, the lighting is for 
human vision. These parameters (frequency and duty) must be carefully studied based on human vision.  
Based on the Psychophysics of vision and Broca-Sulzer effect, a WLED experiment was conduct by Masafumi JINNO. 
He concluded that the brightness can be doubled than that of DC driven when the WLED is driven by PWM pulse with 
frequency equal to 60 hertz and duty is 95%. A more detailed inspection was carried out and concluded that the use of

Experiments are done by Andrei Gorea, and the results said that when the duration time in 10ms or less, the required 
contrast of 0.5, while the duration time more than 50ms, the required contrast will be reduced to 0.1[6]. The duration 
time of the PWM operation is often less than 50ms, so the light source must be designed to select the contrast of 0.5 or 
more. 
2.3 Broca-Sulzer Law  
This theorem is also under study in the vision response to flash phenomenon. Different points are when light indubitable, 
what response of vision will be. This experiment is to find the vision response using difference duration time, taken 
between 50 milli-second to 200 milli-second. When flash appeared, vision will reaction quickly, but this time there will 
be a perception of stimuli beyond the actual weighting, drop to reflect the actual brightness. Experimental results, on 
dark background, the highest response in 0.046 second if the stimulus brightness used 170 lux, if the stimulus brightness 
is 126 lux, then the highest response in 0.062 second [8]. It should be noted that when the flash duration time when more 
than 0.125 second effect will be substantially weakened. If more than 0.5 second, Broca-Suzler effect will not exist. 
2.4 Ferry-Porter Law 
When the flicker frequency keeps increasing, flashes phenomenon will gradually disappear. Such as persistence of vision 
happened in 35 hertz, when flashes of feeling disappeared, at this time enter the flicker fusion. This frequency point 
called flicker fusion frequency. Also called critical flicker fusion (CFF) frequency, because the sense is feeling flicker or 
not flicker. Ferry-Porter [9][10] found that high stimulus intensity will increases CFF. Experiment done by Tyler and 
Hamer, the difference between stimulus intensity and background intensity increase, will enhance the relative CFF [11]. 
So when the needs of different lighting design, has different CFF. Usually when the lighting environment, the greater the 
contrast with the background, the higher is required to CFF, which explains why people read high-frequency lamps will 
be comfortable. 
2.5 Talbot-Plateau Law  
At the time when flicker fusion occurs, the Talbot-Plateau Law scope of operation is started. When the flashing light 
continued to stimulate the vision, the frequency increased gradually let the flicker sense disappeared, then the brightness 
will fall into a sense of the average state. This behavior is also a temporal summation. For example, a lighting system of 
the PWM, driver duty at 50%, brightness sense will equivalent to 50% of DC-driven. It is noteworthy that when the gap 
between two different duty values is not large, vision can not distinguish the difference. Experiment by Hsien-Liang Liu 
and J-J Junz Wang, at 1KHz driven, duty difference of 20% can not be distinguished [2]. Experiment by Masafumi 
JINNO, duty difference of 5% can not be distinguished [3]. 
3. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS  
In this paper, we want to find the best drive methods in white-light LED PWM operation, and to verify the theory 
described in Section II for the white-light LED lighting on the suitability. The Experiment we report is not working at the 
dark environment, because the environment is not the completely dark room, the room is often with much external 
ambient light. For the above reasons, we design a similar lighting environment to the real, and we want to find the 
operation range that we can work. 
There are three main experiments will be conducted, they are flash, CFF and DC lighting experiments. The purpose of 
the flash experiment is to find the frequency threshold for the eye can’t feel flickered. The lighting frequency of lighting 
system need higher than the value in this experiment reported for avoiding the eye feel uncomfortable. In this experiment, 
we also find the highest sensitivity for eye to design the warning lighting.  
Before the DC lighting experiments, we must find the frequency let human feel no flicker. This experiment is work for 
general lighting, a general lighting must provide a steadily lights, let human eye feel smooth and comfortable. This 
experiment want to find the highest CFF. 
In the DC lighting experiments, we want to find the method can reduce the drive current but not cause the light-sensitive 
approach loss. The method is created by the affect for sensitivity impact with different duty when the visual feel no 
flickered, and the relationship between the frequency and the environment. 
Proc. of SPIE Vol. 8120  81200L-3
First, using a single light box do the flash experiment, change the duty to test sensitivity response and CFF changes at 
different illuminance. Then use two sets of the same light box be independently operation of the LED lamps, use 
different PWM operations, record observer’s interactive response and compare them. Second, do DC-source driven 
experiment on both sets based on flashing the CFF data. Then one set keep on DC driven, while another set is for 
comparing, which is applied by PWM modulating. We need to find the PWM frequency which is done by slowly varying 
the frequency until the observer feel the two test sets has the same result. Now we got the operating of the PWM that 
have the same effect as DC driven. Finally, to find the best PWM duty, apply the obtained frequency on both test box 
and slowly varying the duty value and to observe interactive response and compare the different results of two test boxes. 
 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The experiments are flickering test and DC test. The observers are use eye watching experiments and describe the feeling, 
but feeling is a very vague thing that not easy be digitized, and different people has different feeling, only five observers 
in our experiments cannot be the requirement of medical statistics, but all the record of observers reaction after finish, 
that changes of response are similar. So the following only show one of observer results, to illustrate the effects that we 
found. 
 
4.1 Flash experiments 
The purpose of twinkle light is for warning and not for lighting. To find the best PWM parameters of frequency value 
and duty value that give somebody rise to attention. In the preliminary experiment with the driven duty is a 50% 
square-wave, we found the frequency in the 17 hertz can occur maximum sensitivity at observation point B. Setting the 
frequency at 17 hertz, we found that the sensitivity will vary with duty change. Because the different duty affects the 
brightness sense to cause the different warning, the proportion between the appropriate ratio and the warning lights 
should be carefully observed. To find this proportion, change the duty from 10% and 90% with the frequency and record 
the highest sensitivity. Based on the different frequency that has highest sensitivity in different duty ratio to compare the 
frequency of the strongest sensitivity with other duty can find the best matching range.

value is increased to between 65Hz to 72Hz when OFF light. When the illuminance difference between the environment 
and lighting LED is increased, the CFF value is increased also. When the duty value is increased, the CFF value is 
decreased.

Experiments also found that if only pay attention to the observation point A around and watch the LED light, does not 
reach the flashing frequency increases, the internal edge of the area will flicker slightly. Experiments also found that if 
only pay attention to the observation point A around and watch the LED light, increases frequency to no flicker, the 
internal edge of the light box will still feel flicker slightly. From Figure 3, we found that brightness will determine the 
CFF. In real world, if the human eye is closer to lighting a stronger brightness felt, on the other hand, a weaker 
brightness felt. The CFF value found in short distance will not apply to long distance. Experiment result shows that the 
largest CFF is 75Hz. In order to comply with any room lighting use, the drive frequency to be increased to at least double 
that is 150 hertz or more can be guaranteed not to feel flicker. 
 
4.3 DC lighting experiments 
Based on Talbot-Plateau Law and Bloch's Law, the energy intensity will decide light feeling that is different duty equal 
to the different brightness sense. Preliminary experiments have found that visual for the slight differences are not very 
accurate, and this inaccurate response may help energy saving design. In this subsection, we want to find how much 
difference in duty value that our visual sensing will not be stimulated. 
First, the driving frequency is increased to 150Hz for the operation is much greater than CFF. Then, one light box for the 
control group, another light box is comparison group; adjust the duty to pursue the perceived brightness of the control 
group by observer. The observation in point B that distance is 50cm. The duty difference is absolute of control group 
duty subtract comparison group duty. For example, if control group is forty percent and comparison group is thirty-seven 
percent, than duty difference is three percent.  
The results are shown in Figure 4. From Figure 4, we can find that when the duty value is smaller, our visual system can 
easier to detect the change in duty value, on the other hand, when the duty value is larger, our visual system is more 
difficult to detect the change in duty value. The test light ON when the ambient brightness of 142 Lux, the duty in 
control group is 70% or more, then comparison group will more difficult to identify, resulting in Figure 4, the Dark line

5. CONCLUSION 
To design the Warning lights, we use the Broca-Sulzer law can achieve the effect of the perceived brightness increasing, 
and the sensitive can be promote when the light is flashing continuous, it can enhance the warning effect. We advocate 
the range of the using frequency between 7 Hz to 18 Hz, because the bright sensitive for every people are different. 
According to the difference of ambient light decided the bright of light, the warning light brightness must be greater with 
the ambient light higher. The effect is the best when the duty is operated between 40% and 50%, and the duty need to be 
increased with the ambient light become brighter. 
In general lighting, the frequency needs to be increased higher than the range of flicker fusion frequency. The flicker 
fusion frequency is different for every people, so increasing the frequency higher than 150 Hz can cause the sensitive of 
flash is disappear. This way can be used to increase the bright. Because the environmental bright effect the eye to discern 
the duty, when the environmental bright is much light, it’s much default to identify the duty vary.   
If we don’t consider the effect of environmental bright in indoor lighting system, the ability of duty identify will become 
much low when the bright is increase. By our experiments, when the illuminance more than 500 Lux than sense will 
saturate, more than this brightness is usually ineffective, the range from 300Lux to 500Lux the duty difference cannot be 
identified almost to 5%, if less than 250Lux dropped to 2%.
