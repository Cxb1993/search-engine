A SAW device can be structured as cascade connection of two or more elements【3】. Also, the propagation of 
surface acoustic wave bares the similar mechanism as the propagation of RF magnetic wave【25,26】.  It is 
reasonable to suggest that when SAW elements are manufactured with the basic structures and are cascaded 
orderly, parameters describing the characteristics of the SAW network can also be represented as function of 
the delay operator 1z − . This reveals that the transfer function of a signal-line network of the SAW can have 
the same form as that of a discrete-time signal processor, as it had been investigated with equal-length 
coupled-serial-shunt non-uniform transmission lines. Considering the excellent properties of SAW filters, the 
chain-scattering parameter investigations carried on transmission line elements may as well carry on the 
investigation of SAW filters.  Furthermore, the design of a microwave signal processor such as differentiator, 
may as well cascade connection of SAW elements and the overall chain-scattering parameters are the 
sequential multiplication of individual chain-scattering parameter matrices.    
 
In this investigation, we employ chain-scattering parameters to characterize all SAW basic structures. Based 
on the chain-scattering parameters for SAW filter elements, some microwave signal processors may be 
explored using SAW filter elements and Z-transform technique. The Z-transform representation of SAW filter 
elements makes it possible to utilize abundant examples of well developed discrete-time systems. The major 
aspects to be addressed are: (1), chain-scattering parameter representations of SAW elements; (2), Z-domain 
representations of SAW elements; (3), optimization methods of synthesized SAW elements; (4), Z domain 
formulations of differentiator; (5), implementation of SAW elements 
      
The problem investigated is the design of SAW fundamental elements that can be cascaded, and characterized 
with the chain scattering matrix. The cascaded network consisting of these elements is then characterized 
with the sequential multiplication of the chain scattering matrix of each fundamental element.

elements. For example, a zero at z =1 requires a Series-open laddered one-port SAW resonator, a zero at z = 
-1 is realized by a shunt-open laddered one-port SAW resonator and a pair of zeros locating on the unit circle 
|z| = 1can be implemented with a two-section shunt-open laddered one-port SAW resonator. To obtain a 
laddered one-port SAW resonator network that satisfies the system function defined by a microwave signal 
processor, we should attain a laddered one-port SAW resonator network so that the poles and zeros of T(z) in 
(2) should be as close to those of the system function F(z) of a discrete-time prototype signal processes as 
possible. To facilitate the synthesis procedures, we may convert T(z) and F(z) into their respective 
auto-regression processes )( zTAR and )(zFAR . By adjusting the characteristic impedances of transmission 
lines, we can get【22】 
)()( zFzT ARAR ≈                          (13)  
In this phase of our study, we adjust characteristic impedances of all one-port SAW resonator elements so that 
the transfer function T(z) of the network is very close to the system function F(z) of a discrete-time prototype 
process in the sense of least-mean-square error.  
  
Z domain formulations of differentiator 
The differentiater is a very useful tool in the DSP system. Various methods had been developed to design 
discrete finite impulse responses and/or infinite impulse responses of these processors in the Z domain
【25,26】. Those investigations focused on the improvement of linearity over a wide frequency band. To 
construct a differentiator, we consider a system function as follows

zCzG                    (14) 
where d is a constant that dictates the linearity in the amplitude response over the frequency band.  
Many of these representations can be implemented by using laddered SAW resonators. In this phase of our 
study, we investigate the Z-domain formulations of discrete signal processes. In particular, we propose to 
focus on both the effectiveness and operating frequency bandwidth of each process.
