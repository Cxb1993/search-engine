This paper presents the experimental findings on the turbulent structure in the 
vicinity of bottom mounted structures of an open channel. Three model structures 
used in this study have geometric porosities of 0%, 34.9% and 47.5%. Detailed 
measurements of the velocity fields, turbulent intensity components, and dissipative 
eddy size were taken by the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) at different 
locations around the structures. Near the interface, it is found that the dissipative eddy 
size is equal to 0.048, 0.082, and 0.129 mm for the solid structure, 34.9% porous 
structure, and 47.5% porous structure, respectively. These data sheds some light on 
the numerical modeling of flow over porous structures. The dissipative eddy sizes 
suggest the eddy motion may across the interface into the gaps of the porous 
structures. This interaction of the free turbulent flow with the flow inside the porous 
structure may result in the penetration of turbulence into the upper area of the porous 
structure and to increased turbulence levels. 
1.INTRODUCTION 
Flows around bottom mounted structures are of fundamental importance, since 
they give rise to intense and highly turbulent recirculation zones and near-wall 
streamwise vortices. Flow separation from the structures results in strong shear layers, 
along which turbulence production is large. The high turbulence levels increase 
diffusion and enhance entrainment by the shear layer of low momentum recirculation 
flow in the near wake region. Depending on the materials used, wall mounted 
structures can be divided into solid and porous structures. The complexity and variety 
of flows around solid and porous structures require a detailed study of their 
characteristics: separation, mixing, reattachment, reversed flow, boundary-layer 
recovery, etc. (see Figure 1). 
The interaction of flow and solid structures had been thoroughly investigated 
(Hussein and Martinuzzi, 1996; Larichkin and Yakovenko, 2003; Gao and Chow, 
2005). Recently, porous structures such as gabion mattresses, rubble-mound weir, and 
rock spurs for the protection of river structures have received great interest in 
hydraulic engineering. Early experimental investigations on porous structures were in 
some cases motivated by a desire to prevent scouring in a river. Maynord (1995) 
presented a design procedure for sizing gabion mattresses. Yoon (2005) investigated 
the dependency of flow properties on gabion failure mechanisms. Theoretical 
considerations of flow within a porous structure can be found in publications such as 
Michioku et al. (2005) and Li and Garga (1998). The former performed 
one-dimensional analysis for discharge through a permeable rubble mound weir,

hydraulic tests. The length (L), width (W), and height (H) of the structures were 0.15 
m, 0.3 m and 0.075 m, respectively. The porous structures consisted of different glass 
beads, having diameters equal to 0.015 m and 0.025 m, resulting in the porosities  
equal to 34.9% and 47.5%, respectively. Three structures were mounted at a position 
2.915 m downstream of the inlet of the test section. The slope of the channel was kept 
constant and equal to 1/600. The approaching flow depth was kept at 0.242 m and the 
experiment was run for a uniform free stream velocity (U) of 0.206 m/s.

A down-looking ADV made by Nortek, was used to measure the instantaneous 
velocity components at a rate of 25 Hz around the structures. Measurements were 
conducted at the vertical central line of the cross section. Velocity records were taken 
over the entire flow depth at heights separated by 0.005~0.01 m. Each sampling point 
was instantaneous at the measuring sampling frequency for 10~25 min. The 
instantaneous velocities were statistically averaged to get the turbulence properties, 
including turbulence intensity, turbulent kinetic energy, etc. The streamwise 
turbulence intensity (Tu ), vertical turbulence intensity (Tv ) and turbulent kinetic 
energy ( k ) were calculated from 
2/12 )(uTu   (1) 
2/12 )(vTv   (2) 
where u  is the fluctuation of u, v  is the fluctuation of v, and w  is the 
fluctuation of w. In order to characterize the turbulence structure, the characteristic 
turbulence scales were studied. The Kolmogorov’s length scale (  ), which 
characterizes the real sizes of dissipative eddies (Nikora and Smart 1997), was 
calculated from the relation 
4/13 )/(    (3) 
where   is the kinematic viscosity of fluid, and   is the energy dissipation rate. 
The energy dissipation rate was evaluated from the velocity spectra ( uS ), using the 
inertial subrange:

the structure seems to be anisotropic for all the structures. Significant maximum 
values of vertical turbulence intensity are about 70% of those of the streamwise 
turbulence intensity for the solid structure, while that for the porous structures are 
about 60%. This results from the bleed flow effect which reduces the vertical velocity 
fluctuation. As the flow moves downstream, the turbulent structure gradually recovers 
its isotropic characteristics.
