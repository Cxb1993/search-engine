Abstract 
Cancer is a complex disease developing 
from accumulating multiple gene mutations. 
In different subtypes of a cancer, patients 
may carry diverse gene mutations even if 
they have similar symptoms. Therefore, 
many studies have been designed to probe 
the mechanism of carcinogenesis by 
analyzing the gene expression profiles from 
microarray data. In this project, we have 
gathered microarray gene expression data of 
ovarian cancer from literature. And 
according to those data, we have developed a 
marker gene selection method for multiclass 
gene expression data to dig out the marker 
genes for different cancer subgroups. Also, 
we have built up a multiclass diagnostic 
system based on the selected marker genes 
and machine learning techniques. 
Furthermore, through cooperation with 
clinical doctors we have collected ovarian 
cancer tissue samples and clinical data from 
Taiwanese patients. Those Taiwanese 
clinical data will be used to verify our 
simulation results by wet-lab experiments in 
the future.

Background
Many studies have investigated the mechanism of carcino-
genesis by analyzing the gene expression profiles from
microarray data. Accurate diagnosis of different categories
of cancers or identification of subgroups with homogene-
ous molecular signature is important for proper treatment
and prognosis. The application of gene expression data for
these tasks is challenging because of its high dimensional
nature and the noisy characteristics. Since the number of
genes contained in each chip is far exceeding the number
of available samples, the standard statistical methods for
classification often do not work well. Therefore, identifi-
cation of informative genes related to a set of diseases is
an important subject in the field of biomedical informat-
ics at least for two reasons: understanding the roles played
by the genes in cancer biology and development of tools
for efficient and accurate diagnostic prediction.
Many novel classification, clustering and prediction meth-
odologies have been suggested to analyze gene expression
data [1-4]. Here we need to deal with two problems: iden-
tification of marker genes (this is a problem of dimension-
ality reduction) and use of the marker genes for designing
a diagnostic prediction system. For the second problem
many machine learning tools, such as Neural Networks,
Decision Trees, Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Naive Bayes
classifier, Support Vector Machines have been used [5-8].
For the problem of gene selection also many methods
have been proposed [2,4,7-10]. Gene selection methods
can further be grouped into two categories: linear methods
and non-linear methods.
The linear methods are very intuitive which exploit the
linear relation between expression levels and the status of
the disease. In other words, for a two-class problem, say
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myelog-
enous Leukemia (AML), the high expression level may
correspond to ALL while a low expression level may corre-
spond to AML or vice versa. Two such indices are Signal-
to-Noise ratio (SNR) [2] and correlation [7]. The SNR for
a gene g is defined as SNR(g) = (μ1(g) - μ2(g))/(σ1(g) +σ2(g)), where μi(g) and σi(g) are the mean and standard
deviation of expression levels of a gene g for samples in
class i (i = 1, 2), respectively. The authors in [7] adopted
several formulae (Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation,
SNR, etc.) for measuring the similarity between the
expression levels of a gene g and an ideal gene gideal in a 2-
class problem, where an ideal gene pattern was defined by
gideal = (gideal,1, , gideal,G), gideal,j = 1, if the jth sample is from
class 1, otherwise gideal,j = 0; ∀ j = 1, , G. The ideal values
can also be taken as 0 for class 1 and 1 for the class 2. Let
xg be the vector consisting of the expression values for a
gene g for all samples. Now the Pearson correlation or
cosine similarity between the two vectors gideal and xg can
be used to rank the genes. Although very intuitive, these
methods are neither easy to generalize to multiclass, nor
such methods can take into account non-linear interac-
tion between genes. The BW ratio [4] is a linear index that
can be used for multiclass problems, but it is less intuitive
and it is not easy to visualize its behavior.
Note that, there have been attempts to adapt two-class
methods such as correlation for multiclass problems
using the one-vs-all strategy [11]. In [11], first a set of
genes is selected based on ANOVA. Then using this short-
listed genes, a set of important genes is identified for each
class by casting the problem into a two class problem. We
call these method as ANOVA+Correlation method. For
example, in a k-class problem, to get a set of important
genes for class c, samples from class c are considered from
class 1 and all samples from the remaining classes pooled
together are treated as class 2. Then the correlation, as
explained, in the previous paragraph is computed. Such a
method will select strong marker genes, but may also
select poor ones because the pooled class will have a
much stronger and undesirable effect on the correlation
than the class under consideration. Similarly, using the
OVA strategy the SNR can also be used to select genes for
a multiclass problem [12]. We shall call this method as
OVA.SNR. In the OVA.SNR approach, for a k-class prob-
lem, to select useful genes, say, for class 1, the data set is
divided into two groups, data from class 1 and data from
the the remaining 2 to k classes. Although such methods
may find useful genes, in this case, the mean and standard
deviation of the pooled group may not (usually will not)
represent any useful information about the remaining
classes. For example, in a 3-class problem, suppose for a
gene, samples from each of the three classes are normally
distributed (this is an assumption made while using
ANOVA type tests). For simplicity, suppose we have n
samples from each of the three classes and the mean and
standard deviation computed from these samples for the
three classes are μi, σi; i = 1, , 3, respectively. In the
OVA.SNR approach, the mean of the second group,
 does not represent the central tendency of the
pooled group and hence it does not represent any useful
information about the structure of the remaining two
classes. Moreover, when samples from class 2 and class 3
are normally distributed with two different means, the
pooled samples will not be normally distributed. Hence,
OVA schemes, which use mean of the pooled class, for
gene selection is not conceptually appealing, although
such approaches may find useful discriminatory genes.

AF1Q, (d) FGFR4. The gene FCGRT (Fc fragment of IgG,
receptor) has an EWS (Ewing sarcomas) specific signature
because it is moderate to highly upregulated for the EWS
group and is downregulated for the other three groups.
This gene is known to play significant roles in other types
of cancers too. For example, in [17] authors suggested a
set of 26 prognostic genes that can provide predictive
information on the survival of patients suffering from
lung cancer. They found that a higher expression level of
FCGRT relates to a better survival outcome.

by Fig. 1(c), AF1Q is moderate to highly express for the
neuroblastoma cases, while it exhibits low expression val-
ues for the other three groups of the SRBCT.
As discussed in [10,27], FGFR4 carries out the signal trans-
duction to the intracellular environment in cellular prolif-
eration, differentiation and migration. Overexpression of
FGFR4 is found in various cancers, such as of pituitary,
prostate, thyroid [28-30], but in normal tissues, FGFR4
expression is hardly noticeable. In our study with the

suggested that ABCC3 may be involved in chemoresist-

reveals that for most of the SQ samples KRT5 is highly
expressed while its expression level for the other four
groups in the Lung Cancer data set is practically absent.

this gene may not be considered a very good dormant
gene. In some cases, the identified dormant genes may not
even be good from pattern recognition point of view also.
As an example, consider Fig. 2(d) depicting the expression
values of the most dormant gene for the RMS group.
Clearly, the distribution of expression levels reveals that
this gene cannot distinguish the RMS group from the EWS
and NB groups. This is an indicator that for the RMS group
we do not have any good dormant gene. This can be
checked from the average values of GDIDor in Table 1. For
the EWS and BL groups the average GDIDor values for the
most dormant genes are 1.37 and 2.04 respectively, while
for the RMS group it is only 0.75.
The scatterplots of three most dominant genes for the
Leukemia data set, one for each class, are displayed in Fig.
3. Fig. 3(a) depicts that the gene MME has a very strong
ALL specific signature and Fig. 3(c) representing
CHRFAM7A has a strong signature for the AML group;
while the gene MBNL1 (Fig. 3(b)) although has an MLL
specific signature, it is not as strong as that of the other
two genes. Fig. 4 depicts the scatterplots of the most dor-
mant genes for Leukemia data set. Here we find that for
majority of the samples in the ALL group, the most dor-
mant gene, LGALS1, takes low expression values com-
pared to the samples from the other two groups. In this
case the separation between the average expression values
between the ALL and AML groups is quite high making it
a good dormant gene. This is also revealed by the GDI val-
ues of 1.66. Similarly, for the AML class, the most dor-
mant gene, MEF2A, is downregulated for the AML group,
while it is upregulated for the remaining groups (the aver-
age GDI value is 1.89). Thus, this gene can also be consid-
ered a good dormant gene.

using the dormant genes. Comparing the Sammon's plot
with the dominant genes, we find that although the dor-
mant genes approximately reveal the class structures,
these are not as clear as in the case of the dominant genes.
In fact, there are some mixing up of the groups. This
explains the poor test performance obtained with the dor-
mant genes (details in the next section).
For the Leukemia data set, Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) display
the Sammon's plots using dominant and dormant genes
considering the training and independent data sets
together. Unlike, SRBCT here for both dominant and dor-
mant genes the three classes are almost well separated.
This is in conformity with comparable and good perform-
ance of all six classifiers using the dominant and dormant
genes (discussed in the next section). These results imply
that the dominant or dormant genes selected from each
subgroup of the microarray data set contribute good dis-
crimination power between classes.
For the CNS and the Lung Cancer data sets there is no
independent test data set. Figs. 11 and 12 show the Sam-
mon's plots for these two data sets. In the case of CNS,
with dominant genes, the Sammon's plot exhibits very
nice class structure for all classes (only one point of PNET,
primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors, class is mixed up).
But for the dormant genes, all but PNET class form nice
clusters in the Sammon's plot. For the Lung Cancer data
although with the dominant genes the class structures
emerge in the Sammon's plot, with the dormant genes the
COID (pulmonary carcinoids) group stands out sepa-
rately but other classes are overlapped. This should not be
used to infer that the performance of classifiers using the
dormant genes would be poor – this is not indeed the

selected genes. Note that, in [8] using 20 genes the best
classification error achieved on the test data is 5.8%; while
in our case even with just 12 dominant genes all six clas-
sifiers can produce very comparable test accuracies with
that of the best results in [8] using 20 genes. The perform-
ance of our four SVM classifiers using just 3 genes (one
from each class) is better than that of both SVM classifiers
in [8] using 20 genes. This clearly indicates the quality of
the dominant marker genes identified by GDIDom. Unlike
the SRBCT, for this data set, the dormant genes also have
good discriminating power. In fact, with 15 dormant
genes the classification error rates for our two non-SVM
classifiers are comparable to the best classier performance
in [8] using 20 genes; while the performance of our four
SVM classifiers is significantly better than that of the
remaining four classifiers in [8]. In these figures "Combi-
nation" refers to using both sets of dominant and dor-
mant genes together to design the classifier. In Fig. 14,
with 18 genes (3-fold, 9 dominant and 9 dormant genes),
the lowest error rate of 4.9% is achieved. Here we observe
that combining dominant and dormant genes does not
always improve the performance of the classifiers. How-
ever, later we shall see that use of dominant and dormant
genes together improves the performance on the inde-
pendent test data.
In [8] authors proposed two new gene selection methods
based on MMC and used two SVM based gene selection
methods from the literature. Considering three classifiers
NMC, MMC, and SVM, they have reported results using
eight combinations of classifier and gene selection
method as shown in the right side of Fig. 15. For each of
these eight combinations they have considered 10 genes
and 20 genes for performance evaluation. Considering the
combinations using the SVM based gene selection and the
NMC and SVM classifiers, for the CNS data we find that
the test error varies between 45.4% and 54.0% using 10
genes, while the same lies between 34.9% and 42.6%
using 20 genes. On the other hand, using the MMC based
feature selection methods, the error rates for the NMC and
MMC classifiers using 10 genes vary between 24.4% and
27.6%, while error rates using 20 genes lie in 22.5%–
22.9%. We observe in Fig. 15 that using just 5 dominant
genes, one from each class identified by our method, the
error rates of the six classifiers varied between 33% and
36%, while using 20 dominant genes the test error rates
over the six classifiers varied between 22.9% and 27.8%.

result in [5] (see, far right side of Fig. 16), the evaluation
criteria and computational protocols are not the same. For
example, we have used only 5–25 (less that 0.20% of the
12600) genes, while in [5]all 12600 genes are used; we
have generated statistics about test accuracies using 100
sets (generated by resampling), while in [5] a 10 fold
cross-validation is used; for the SVM classifier we have
used the most simple linear kernel and the nonlinear
Gaussian kernel for comparison, while in [5] authors have
used nonlinear polynomial kernel and several other
sophisticated classifiers such as back-propagation neural
networks, and probabilistic neural networks.
In order to look at the statistical significance of the average
GDI values of the dominant and dormant genes identified
based on 100 data splitting experiments, here we further
perform the permutation test 500 times (Details about the
procedure can be found in the Materials and Methods sec-
tion). These results are summarized in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4.
From these tables we find that each of the selected domi-
nant/dormant genes in every data set has a highly reliable
p- and q-values. Especially, for those selected dominant/
dormant genes, which appeared with very high frequen-
cies, the p- and q-values are practically zero (0). Hence,
from a statistical viewpoint, our method can recognize
genes with trustworthy class-specific characteristics. Such
genes can be used to design more reliable diagnostic sys-
tems.
In addition, we have checked the literature for other sim-
ilar methods for identifying marker genes associated with
one class in a multiclass environment. In this context, Pav-
lidis and Noble [11] use ANOVA and Correlation
together. We call this scheme as ANOVA+Correlation
scheme. In [12] SNR is used for preliminary screening of
genes which is followed by the use of a SVM based tech-
nique. Both these schemes for multiclass analysis use a
one-versus-all (OVA) approach. We have implemented
the ANOVA+Correlation scheme and also used SNR with
OVA strategy to select class specific genes. The later
method is referred to as "OVA.SNR". As revealed by Tables
5 and 6, all three gene selection methods (GDI.Dominant,
OVA.SNR and ANOVA+Correlation) produce comparable
results.
In this context it is worth emphasizing that many genes
may have discriminating power and hence can be consid-
ered marker genes but the dominant and dormant genes
are special types of markers and all marker genes are not
necessarily dominant/dormant genes. GDI is designed to
identify dominant/dormant genes, if present. Moreover,

We now illustrate with a synthetic data set that SNR
(OVA) can lead to false positive dominant/dormant
genes. Figure 17 shows the expression values of a five-class
data where each class has the same number of samples
and roughly the same standard deviation. It is clear that
this gene is not a dominant gene. The GDI value for the
black class is 0.61 while SNR (OVA) for the same class is
1.54. Note that, since we are using one-versus-all philoso-
phy, a SNR value of 1.54 is expected to be much more sig-
nificant than a GDI value of 0.61. The most significant
difference between SNR (OVA) and GDI methods is that
the value of SNR (OVA) is influenced by samples from all
other group while GDI uses a comparison of only two
selected groups with the highest mean values.
Depending on the data sets the behavior of these three
methods (GDI.Dominant, OVA.SNR and ANOVA+Corre-
lation) may be similar in terms of classifier performance,
but dominant/dormant genes identified may be different.
An important distinctive feature of GDI over OVA is that
it can effectively reduce the false positive cases. Even
though, the set of top significant dominant/dormant
genes from each class identified by these three methods
may be similar, the importance (priority) of those genes
as dominant/dormant genes may be different.
Conclusion
We have proposed generalizations of the SNR index for
multiclass problems through the introduction of two indi-
ces, GDIDom and GDIDor. These have led us to define dom-
inant genes and dormant genes with respect to a set of
related diseases/cancers. Both dominant and dormant
genes have class specific signatures and hence can be used
to design useful diagnostic prediction systems. We have
explained that good dominant genes are very useful for
diagnosis and usually are expected to be present. How-

ever, strong dormant genes may not always be available,
but if they exist, they are also quite useful for diagnosis.
Based on the GDI values we have proposed a mechanism
for selecting a set of useful biomarkers that may play sig-
nificant roles in the biology of the set of diseases (here
cancers) under consideration and can be used to design
useful diagnostic prediction systems. It is possible to
design other methods of discovering biomarkers using the
GDIs. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed
method can identify good biomarkers.
In order to establish the utility of the dominant and dor-
mant genes we have considered four multi-category can-
cer data sets. First, we have analyzed the roles of some of
the dominant and dormant genes in cancer biology. Then
we have used visual assessment techniques to assess the

Computation of GDI for dominant genes
Now we define the GDIDom for the gene under considera-
tion as:
As discussed above, the index at Equation 1 can be com-
puted for each gene and then the GDIDom values can be
sorted in descending order. A higher value of GDIDom indi-
cates that the gene for the m-th class is significantly over-
expressed compared to the r-th class and obviously it is
more strongly over-expressed compared to the remaining
classes. Thus, it is a dominant gene for class m or 1(s).
Dominant genes, if exist, will appear at the top of the
sorted list. A set of genes can then be selected from this
sorted list for further processing. Note that, for a two class
problem, although we do not use the absolute value in the
numerator, because of the sorting, Equation 1 is exactly
the same as that of Golub's SNR index [2]. In other words,
the GDIDom can be viewed as true generalization of
Golub's SNR for a multiclass problem.
Computation of GDI for dormant genes
However, the GDIDom in Equation 1 will not be able to
find the dormant genes, if any. In order to find the dor-
mant genes we can proceed as follows. If the gene under
consideration is a dormant one, then it will be unex-
pressed for one class but at least moderately expressed for
all of the remaining classes. In this case, (μk-1(s) - μk(s))
should be considerably high, where μk(s) is the last value in
the sorted sequence; in other words, it is the mean expres-
sion level for the class in which the gene under considera-
tion is least expressed. Thus, we define the GDIDor for
identifying the dormant gene as
Note that, Equation 1 uses the class mean values and
standard deviations of the top two classes in the sorted list
while Equation 2 uses the class means and standard devi-
ations corresponding to the last two values in the sorted
list. Consequently, if GDIDor is significantly high for a
gene, then this gene is a dormant gene for the class repre-
sented by k(s).
It is easy to see that for a two class problem, GDIDor
reduces to the SNR of [2]. Thus both GDIDom and GDIDor
can be viewed as generalizations of SNR. We can combine
Equations 1 and 2 and write in a convenient manner as in
Equation 3.
In Equation 3 when x = Dom, p and q correspond to the
top two classes, respectively, in the sorted list and when x
= Dor, then p and q correspond to the last two classes in
the sorted list, respectively.
We want to emphasize that a dominant gene is dominant
for a class with respect to the given set of classes/groups
under consideration. For example, given the SRBCT
group, a gene may be dominant for the Neuroblastoma
class implying that this gene is highly expressed for the
Neuroblastoma cases but unexpressed for the other three
types of childhood cancers. Now if we augment the set of
four childhood cancers by one more type, then this partic-
ular gene may not remain dominant with respect to the
group of five childhood cancers. Similar is the case with
dormant genes.
Finding a list of dominant/dormant genes for each class
After calculating the GDIDom values of all genes, a list of
dominant genes for each class can be obtained as follows.
For each gene, the GDIDom is associated to the class repre-
sented by 1(s); in other words, it is associated to the class
corresponding to the top element in the sorted list. In this
way, every gene is associated with a class and a value of
dominancy as expressed by GDIDom. We can now sort the
genes associated with a particular class according to the
GDIDom values. In this way we get a sorted list for each
class. We can now select useful genes for a class from the
top of the list. Clearly, when selecting the dominant
genes, the higher the GDIDom, the more dominant the gene
is. A similar procedure can be applied for the generation
of a list of dormant genes for each class using the GDIDor
values.
Gene selection strategy
If we use several dominant (or dormant or both kinds of)
genes from each class ranked according to GDIDom values
to design diagnostic systems, we are expected to get suffi-
cient discriminating power for all classes in multi-class
discrimination problems. But since in each resampling
experiment we may get a different set of dominant (dor-
mant) genes for a class, it would be better to aggregate the
output of several resampling experiments. Different strat-
egies are possible for this. Next we propose one such strat-
egy:
Frequency-based method
The gene selection scheme is displayed in Algorithm Gene
Selection. It proceeds as follows. In each of the 100 trials,
we select the top m (= 5) dominant (dormant) genes for

如圖一所示，由於此範例程式只是不斷地重複做一簡單運算，因此最底
層是「重複」這個命令，再上一層之後，即是開始套用運算，到圖一上第五
層的「lm」 及圖一下第五層的「lm.fit」便是此運算的核心命令；比較圖一上
下兩圖可以明顯地發現，將核心運算命令由「lm」改為「lm.fit」之後，整體
程式結構減少了許多層次，簡單地說，每一次回圈運算的時候，使用上圖的
寫法，程式需要經過更多層的運算才會得到同樣的結果（執行速度較慢），
而利用如Dr. Dirk Eddelbuettel所介紹的方法改寫後，程式的結構變得更簡
單，執行速度也更快，而這兩個方法最大的差異就是在於，原本的方法使用
了大量的回圈結構，而Dr. Dirk Eddelbuettel所介紹的方法則避免了許多回圈
結構；再看過這個例子之後，大家都實際地瞭解到，撰寫R程式碼的時候要
盡量避免使用回圈結構。除此之外，Dr. Dirk Eddelbuettel也教大家另一種圖
形化程式結構的方法，如下圖二所示： 
 
圖二 
 
圖二的呈現方法與圖一的呈現方法最大的不同是，圖二無法看出程式碼
中各執行步驟的層次與相依性，圖二中只把各步驟條列出來，也箭頭串連各
步驟，但是以圖二的呈現方式，顏色越深的步驟代表整個程式碼運用最多的
步驟，因此在分析我們的程式碼的時候，我們可以很容易地知道那一個步驟
做了最多次的運算，當我們要改進整體程式執行速度的時候，若能加快此步
驟，則對改進整體程式執行速度將有很大的幫助。 
經過以上的討論之後，我們知道R程式雖然在統計方面的計算具有強大
的功能，但是相較於其他程式語言的回圈控制結構部分的執行速度，卻顯得
執行速度不夠快速，因此Dr. Dirk Eddelbuettel基於他自身對於資訊科學的專
長，特意開發了「Rcpp」程式套件，讓R程式的使用者能夠將執行程式時的
