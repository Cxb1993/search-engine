Abstract 
The proliferation of location aware applications, such as healthcare, industrial guidance, and shopping mall 
management, has motivated enormous research in positioning techniques on wireless sensor networks. The 
positioning techniques usually use different types of wireless sensors to measure the position of a desired target, 
and the measured data is classically in the form of time-of-arrival (TOA) or angle-of-arrival (AOA). In addition, 
the accuracy of the measured data varies due to noise, measurement error, and sensor failures. It is important 
for positioning techniques to integrate the data being gathered from different types of sensors with different 
reliability. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm with low complexity to fuse the measured data so 
that heterogeneous sensors can collaborate to accurately estimate the location of a desired target. The key of 
the proposed scheme is that we map the geolocation problem into a graphical model and then use the 
sum-product algorithm to fuse the measured data. The proposed algorithm efficiently utilizes the stochastic 
properties of measurement data by exchanging messages among local processing units in a graphical model. 
Simulation results indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm always outperforms the other 
conventional algorithms.

we propose a low-complexity algorithm to fuse the TOA and AOA measurement data in a heterogeneous 
wireless sensor network in order to accurately estimate the target locations. Contrast to the above-mentioned 
schemes, each sensor only needs an arrival signal to trigger the fusion operation in the proposed algorithm. 
After obtaining the TOA and AOA measurement data from the heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, the 
information are sent to the data fusion center in order to make inferences of the target position locations. In the 
fusion center, the operation of data fusion is based on a factor graph framework [16]. By exchanging messages 
among local processing units in the graphical model, the proposed algorithm can efficiently utilize the 
stochastic properties of the measurement data to enhance the accuracy of target location estimation in 
heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. In addition, the proposed approach can make response to measurement 
data with different level of reliability and is also suitable for distributed processing. Also, simulation results 
indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm always outperforms the other conventional ones. 
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe the system model and 
problem formulation. Next, the proposed algorithm is developed in Section 3 followed by numerical examples 
in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper. 
 
2. System Model and Problem Formulation 
In this section we describe the details of the system model that we apply to the proposed algorithm. The 
scenario we concerned is a heterogeneous wireless sensor network. Therefore in this paper we assume that a 
wireless sensor performs either the TOA or AOA measurement, we then refer the sensor as the TOA-type or the 
AOA-type sensor, respectively. 
    For a TOA-type sensor, it will measure the TOA signals which propagate out of a target with different 
times. The relationship between the TOA measurements and the range measurements can be represented as 
TOA TOAd c t= ×Δ ,                                (1) 
where TOAd  is the target-to-sensor distance, c  is the speed of light which equals to 
83 10  / secm× , and 
TOAtΔ  is the corresponding time-of-arrival information. The mathematical relationship between the target 
location and the known TOA-type sensor locations is, 
( ) ( )2 2j jj T Td x X y Y= − + −  for 1,2, ,j J= " ,              (2) 
where ( ),x y  is the unknown coordinate position of the target, ( ),j jT TX Y  is the known coordinate location of 
the TOA-type sensor, jd  is the distance between the target and 
thj  TOA-type sensor from the TOA 
measurement data, and J is the total number of the TOA-type sensors which can detect the target in a sensor 
field. 
On the other hand, for an AOA-type sensor it measures the AOA information of the incoming signal to 
estimate the target location. Based on the AOA measurement data, a geometric function of straight line between 
the target and the corresponding AOA-type sensor can be determined as

nodes. An edge connects a variable node v to an agent node ( )if ⋅  if and only if v is an argument of ( )if ⋅ . 
After transforming an engineering problem into a factor graph model, the problem can be solved with a 
standard procedure, the sum-product algorithm [16]. The sum-product algorithm, originally invented to perform 
optimum decoding of error-correction codes [16], can also be deemed as an efficient approach to perform data 
fusion which exchange messages among neighboring agent and variable nodes in order to reach a global 
consensus of all the variables, where the messages passed around are the probability density function (pdf) of 
the associated variables. 
    Before we describe the sum-product algorithm, let a bL →  denote the message passed from node a to node 
b. In the following, we briefly summarize the fundamental rules of the sum-product algorithm and for a 
concrete understanding of the sum-product algorithm, the interested reader can refer to [16] [24]. 
z Rule 1: A piece of message passed from a variable node to an agent node, is simply the product of all 
the messages coming from the other neighboring agent nodes to the variable node. For example, the 
rule for computing a message from a variable node v to an agent node f is given as 
   ( ) ( )
( )\v f l vl v f
L v L v
α
→ →
∈
= ∏ ,                            (4) 
    where we define ( )vα  as the set of agent nodes that are connected to the variable node v, and define 
( ) \v fα  represents the set ( )vα  with the agent node f excluded. 
z Rule 2: A piece of message passed from an agent node to a variable node is the product of a local 
function associated with the agent node and all the messages coming from the other neighboring 
variable nodes to the agent node, summarized over all the related variables except the variable 
associated with the variable node receiving message. For example, the rule for computing a message 
from agent node f to variable node v is given as 
   ( ) { }( ) ( )
( )~{ } \f v m fv m f v
L v f v L m
β
→ →
∈
⎛ ⎞= ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠∑ ∏ ,                      (5) 
where we define ( )fβ  as the set of variable nodes that are connected to the agent node f, we define 
( ) \f vβ  represents the set ( )fβ  with the variable node v excluded, and { }~ v∑  indicating the 
variables being not summed over. 
z Rule 3: With the two rules above, the messages are iteratively passed around among neighboring nodes. 
At the end of each iteration, a variable can be estimated based on the all the messages of the 
corresponding variable node, defined as the product of all the incoming messages. For example, the 
rule for computing an estimate of a variable v can be expressed as 
    ( ) ( )
( ) m vm v
L v L v

3.2 Factor Graph Modeling 
Factor graphs, together with message-passing sum-product algorithms, are known to be able to elegantly solve 
 8
necessary message passing operations for each variable node and each agent node in the Fig. 1. 
3.3 Message Passing Operations 
In this section, we first demonstrate how to obtain an initial guess of the target location x and y, and then 
describe the operations conducted by each node in Fig. 1. Because the TOA and AOA measurements would be 
fused in the variable nodes x and y, in order to make sure they are coincidence before feeding the measurements 
into the proposed factor graph, we have to convert the variance of AOA measurements into that of the TOA 
measurements since the statistic property of AOA measurement is different from that of the TOA measurement. 
The variance conversion between the TOA measurement and the AOA measurement in the proposed method is 
based on the geometric relationships, as depicted in Fig. 2, and can be expressed as 
2 2
i iT i A
σ ρ σ≈ ⋅                                            (10) 
where  
( ) ( )2 2i ii A Ax X y Yρ = − + −                                     (11) 
is the distance between the sensor iA  and target. After that, the procedures for the AOA-type sensors and the 
TOA-type sensors to obtain an initial guess can be described as follows. At the very beginning, a rough target 
location estimation ( ) ( )( )0 , 0x y  can be obtained either by using a 3 available TOA measurements geometrical 
algorithm [26] or by using a 2 available AOA measurements geometrical algorithm. With the rough target 
location estimation providing the direction of the range measurement, for the measurements from the TOA-type 
sensors, we project the assumed-known variance of the range measurement error 2
jd
σ  onto the x-coordinate 
axis and the y-coordinate axis, respectively, to calculate the variances 2
T jx
σ ′  and 2Tjyσ ′ . For the measurements 
from the AOA-type sensors, the assumed-known variance of the angle measurement error can been converted to 
the variance of the range measurement error via (10) before we perform projection operation. Next, we can also 
project the converted variance of the angle measurement error ( )2 2i id i Aσ ρ σ′ ≈ ⋅  onto the x-coordinate axis and the 
y-coordinate axis, respectively, to calculate the variances 2
Aix
σ ′  and 2Aiyσ ′ . Note that the knowledge of the range 
measurement error variance and the angle measurement error variance can be approximated based on the 
background noise and the underlying signal modulation schemes. Thus, with initial guess x(0), y(0), 2
T jx
σ ′ , 2Tjyσ ′ , 
2
Aix
σ ′ , and 2Aiyσ ′  available and with Gaussian pdf assumption of x and y, the initial pdf guesses for ( )xT jx SL x→ , 
( )y
T j
y S
L y→ , ( )xAix SL x→ , and ( )yAiy SL y→  are given as ( )( )2, 0 , TjxN x x σ ′ , ( )( )2, 0 , TjyN y y σ ′ , ( )( )2, 0 , AixN x x σ ′ , 
and ( )( )2, 0 , AiyN y y σ ′ , respectively. It should be noted that since the minimum number of sensor nodes (or 
minimum observation data) required to perform the AOA technique and the TOA technique is two and three, 
respectively, if we only have two TOA measurements in the sensor field, the TOA technique will fail to locate 
 10
( ) ( )2, ~ , ,x j j j T jT j T T T xSf x x N x X x σ ′′ ′ −                           (17) 
where 
jT
X  is the location of TOA-type sensor. Note that (16) is still Gaussian, because the integral of the 
product of any two Gaussian distributions is also a Gaussian distribution and can be calculated as 
( ) ( ) ( )2 2 2 2, , , , ~ , ,a b b b a bN y x N x m dx N y mβ σ σ β σ σ∞−∞ − + ⋅ + +∫ .     (18) 
Therefore, (16) can be easily computed via (18).  
    Next, the message from the variable node 
jT
x′  to the agent node 
j
xy
TM  just directly passes the message 
comes from the agent node 
j
x
TS  to the variable node jTx′  and can be simply expressed as 
( ) ( )xy xj jT TT T j jj j T TS xx ML x L x′′ →→ ′ ′= .                                 (19) 
Regarding the message from the agent node 
j
xy
TM  to the variable node jTy′ , based on Rule 2 described in 
Section 3.1, agent node 
j
xy
TM  gathers the incoming message ( )xy jT Tj j Tx ML x′ → ′ , and evaluates the message sent to 
the variable node 
jT
y′ expressed as   
( ) ( ) ( )~ ,xy xy xyj j j j jT TT T Tj jTj j jjT T T T TM y x M MxL y L x f x y d x′ ′→ →′′ ′ ′ ′ ′⋅∫                       (20) 
where ( ),xy j jT j T TMf x y′ ′  is the associated local function, i.e., the constraint rule of the agent node jxyTM  to define 
the mutual relation between 
jT
x′  and 
jT
y′ . It should be noted that the agent nodes { }jxyTM  play an important 
role in message exchange, i.e., the function of agent node 
j
xy
TM  is to convert the message between the 
x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. However, in order to keep the message passed from agent node 
jT
x′  to 
jT
y′  
variable node to fulfill Gaussian assumption, some approximation has to be made. The detail approximation 
procedures in this paper are identical to our previous work [23], we just present the general formula in (20) 
according to Rule 2 described in Section 3.1. The necessary message calculations from the agent node 
j
xy
TM  
back to the variable nodes x and y and the processing in the y branch of Fig. 1 correspond to the steps described 
above.  
    So far, we finish the description of operations of each variable node and agent node in the right-hand-side 
of Fig. 1. Now, let us shift to describe the operations carried out by each variable node and each agent node in 
the left-hand-side of Fig. 1 i.e., the variable nodes and agent nodes modeled for the AOA-type sensors. The 
operations of each variance node and each agent node of the left-hand-side of Fig. 1 are identical to the 
right-hand-side of Fig. 1 except for the agent nodes { }ixyAM . Like the agent nodes { }jxyTM , agent nodes { }ixyAM  
 12
node y after messages have been updated six times. At the variable node y, the messages will perform the 
sum-product algorithm to fuse all the messages flowing into variable node y. After that, the updated messages 
will flow back to the variable node x from the variable node y after messages have been updated again six times. 
The procedure in which the message flows from variable node x to variable node y and then back to variable 
node x is called “a round”. We then use iterative message updating, with several rounds of computing. After a 
predefined iteration round (i.e., iteration number), we compute the product of all messages directed toward the 
variable node x and y to estimate the target location according to (25) and (26).     
The optimality of the sum-product algorithm is guaranteed if there is no cycle in the factor graph [27]. 
However, we are aware of the fact that the proposed factor graph has cycles and therefore the estimates are only 
an approximation of the optimum solution. Nevertheless, the simulation results indicate that the optimum 
behavior of the proposed algorithm. It should be noted that cycles in the factor graph may significantly reduce 
the algorithm complexity in finding the global solution. Many famous examples of factor graphs are all with 
cycles, including the factor graphs of turbo codes and low density parity check (LDPC) codes, which not only 
enjoy low complexity but also pretty much maintain their optimality in identifying the global solution. 
Regarding the convergence issue, analytical investigations on the convergence properties for the proposed 
algorithm with cycles are hard to establish because the occurring cycles are very short. We are still working on 
it and have reached no conclusive results so far. Therefore, the convergence analysis will not be covered in this 
paper. We can only point out that all the functions involved in the proposed algorithm seem always well 
behaved in terms of the convergence problem. 
Finally, to highlight the low-complexity characteristics of the proposed system, the required operations for 
each node in the factor graph are summarized in Table 1. It is clearly shown that, in each node, only the means 
and the variances of the incoming Gaussian pdf's need to be processed to produce the mean and variance of the 
outgoing Gaussian pdf, and only very little calculation is needed. The distributed nature of factor graph also 
makes the proposed system highly suitable for integrated-circuit implementation. 
 
4. Numerical Results 
Computer simulations are described in this section. For comparison, three conventional algorithms, least square 
(LS) solutions for the TOA geolocation technique, LS solutions for the AOA geolocation technique, and a 
hybrid of the TOA/AOA geolocation technique, are also included in the simulation. Although LS algorithms for 
the TOA geolocation technique and the AOA geolocation technique are not a data-fusion algorithm, they can be 
regarded as performance references for the TOA geolocation technique and AOA geolocation technique to see 
how the estimated target’s location accuracy can be improved if we employ the proposed algorithm to fuse 
these two kinds of data. On the other hand, the hybrid of the TOA/AOA geolocation technique is a 
heterogeneous geolocation technique that combines different types of geolocation techniques to estimate a 
target’s location. It should be noted that when we apply the hybrid of the TOA/AOA geolocation technique to 
estimate a target’s location, the coordinates of the known location of the TOA-type sensor and of the known 
location of the AOA-type sensor have to be exactly the same; otherwise, we cannot use this hybrid of the 
TOA/AOA geolocation technique for positioning. We call each TOA-type sensor and AOA-type sensor located 
at the same coordinate location a “pair of sensors”. The principle behind the hybrid of the TOA/AOA 
geolocation technique can be described as follows. When the range measurement d and AOA θ  are available 
 14
[0,100]. If this sample is smaller than the predefined breaking probability, we assume that the sensor node is 
out of control.  
Regarding the measurement error model in this experiment, the TOA measurement errors and AOA 
measurement errors are modeled as zero mean Gaussian random variables with STD 0.4dσ =  (meter) and  
1.5Aσ =  (degree), respectively. Fig. 6 shows the average location error versus the breaking probability for the 
four algorithms. The average error is evaluated over 10,000 Monte Carlo trials. It is observed that: 1) the 
proposed factor graph-based algorithm always outperforms the other algorithms; 2) the performance of the LS 
solution for the TOA geolocation technique is worst. This is because the maximum number of the TOA-type 
sensor in this experiment is four. However, the minimal values requiring involved sensors for the TOA 
geolocation technique to perform a target’s location estimation is three. In this case, there is enough data for a 
LS solution to improve the target’s location accuracy because some of the sensor nodes are out of control; 3) 
when the breaking probability is up to 40 %, the performance of the proposed algorithm performs much better 
than that of the three conventional algorithms when the breaking probability is 20 %,. This phenomenon shows 
that the proposed factor graph-based algorithm can effectively fuse the TOA and AOA measurements so that the 
heterogeneous sensors can work cooperatively to estimate the location of a desired target.   
 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we study the problem of target location estimation with the help of two types of measurement data, 
i.e. TOA and AOA information, in a heterogeneous wireless sensor network. The proposed low-complexity and 
high-efficiency algorithm is based on the factor graph framework while the sum-product algorithm enables it to 
efficiently fuse the data with different physical types so that the heterogeneous sensors can work cooperatively 
to estimate the location of a desired target. The proposed algorithm efficiently utilizes the stochastic properties 
of measurement data by exchanging soft messages among local processing units in a graphical model. 
Simulation results also indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm always outperforms the other 
conventional algorithms.
