quality level. When a new wire bonding technology is used, the forecasting of quality level growth using the 
gold ball shear strength is necessary to evaluate the performance of the new technology for decision making.  
When a new technology is substituted for an older technology, the performance of the new technology 
can be divided into three growth stages, as follows: 1) the introduction stage; 2) the fast growth stage; and 3) 
the maturity stage (Martino, 1993). Let the quality level of a product be the performance measurement of the 
new technology. During the introduction stage, the older technology has advantages in that it is understood, its 
reliability is probably high, users have confidence in it, and technicians are readily available. The new 
technology is unknown, and its reliability is uncertain; skilled technicians are limited. Hence, the performance 
of quality improvement is not conspicuous; therefore, the quality level increases slowly in this stage. The 
quality level increases rapidly after entering the fast growth stage because the initial problems in the 
introduction stage are solved and the technicians obtain excellent experience in the new technology. During 
the maturity stage, the technicians obtain complete skills in the new production technology, and the quality 
level increases slowly and reaches a steady state. With the three growth stages, the relationship of quality level 
growth and time exhibits an S-curve as a logistic growth curve function. A growth curve is an empirical model 
of the evolution of a quantity over time. A logistic curve is widely used in technological forecasting (Levary & 
Han, 1995; Meade & Islam, 1995, 1998; Meyer & Ausubel, 1999; Meyer et al., 1999; Frank, 2004; Rai & 
Kumar, 2003; Yang & Williams, 2009; Ryu & Byeon, 2011; Chen et al., 2011). This study used the logistic 
curve to forecast the quality level of a gold ball and defective rate of IC at the maturity stage to evaluate the 
performance of new wire bonding technology. 
When a new wire bonding technology is substituted for an older technology, the probability distribution 
of the gold ball shear strength as a quality variable is unknown, and it is necessary to evaluate the defective 
rate of an IC. The probability distribution of the quality variable can be divided into normality and 
non-normality. Weibull distribution as a non-normal distribution was widely used to perform the probability of 
a quality variable (Bebbington et al., 2007; Hallinan, 1993; Wu et al., 2009; Moraisa & Barreto-Souzab, 2011) 
because its probability density function can be freely right-skewed, left-skewed, and symmetrically distributed 
by changing its shape parameter. In general, a quality variable at various periods exhibits the same probability 
distribution; however, its characteristic parameter (location parameter for normal distribution or scale 
parameter for Weibull distribution) differs at each period. This characteristic parameter indicates the quality 
level measurement of the gold ball per period; therefore, the relationship between the characteristic parameter 
and time can be created using a logistic curve. This study fitted the optimal probability distribution of gold 
ball shear strength with normal or Weibull distributions to measure the defective rate of an IC for the new 
wire bonding technology. 
This study regarded the quality level as the performance index to measure the effect of a new wire 
bonding technology. The gold ball shear strength as a quality variable was used to develop a quality level 
forecasting method for a new wire bonding technology in IC packaging. This method applies the logistic 
curve to forecast the quality level of a gold ball and fits the optimal probability distribution of the gold ball to 
forecast the defective rate of an IC. In this study, the probability distributions and a logistic curve were 
combined to develop the forecasting method, and the estimators of several parameters in this model were 
presented using the MLE method. A real example of an IC packaging process is provided to demonstrate the 
application of this forecasting method. 
 
 
2. Methodology 
2.1. Logistic growth curve 
The logistic curve is widely used for technological forecasting. Several new forecasting models were 
proposed based on this logistic curve and included innovations such as the Bass diffusion model and extended 
logistic model (Trappey & Wu, 2008; Meade & Islam, 1995). The logistic curve is also called the Pearl curve. 
This curve is named after the U.S. demographer Raymond Pearl, who popularized its use for population 
forecasting. The formula for the logistic curve is 
 bta
Ly  exp1                                                                        (1) 
where L is the upper limit to the growth of the variable y, t is time, and a and b are the coefficients obtained 
by fitting the curve to the data. The curve has an initial value of zero at time t = - ∞ and a value of L at t = +∞. 
In fitting a logistic curve to a set of data, the formula is transformed into that of a straight line, and the 
 4
rate of an IC. 
2. Normal and Weibull distributions are two assumptive distributions in this study, and the gold ball 
shear strength as a random variable obeys one of two assumptive distributions. 
3. The gold ball shear strength at three growth stages has a common assumptive distribution with a 
constant parameter σ for normal distribution or a constant parameter β for Weibull distribution.  
4. The characteristic value of assumptive distribution is the measurement index of the quality level. 
The characteristic value increases in conjunction with time, and the relationship between the 
characteristic value and time can be fitted by a logistic curve as  
 bta
L
t  exp1   
                                                                   (10) 
where t  is the characteristic value (μ for normal distribution or η for Weibull distribution) at period t. 
According to these assumptions, the parameters β and σ at various periods are constant; however, the 
parameters μ and η grow as the period increases. Therefore, the parameters μ and η can be substituted for (10). 
If the gold ball shear strength is the normal distribution, the probability density function and cumulative 
distribution function of normal distribution can be rewritten as  
          2221 22exp1exp,  btaLxtxfN                                        (11)

where the L, a, b, and σ are parameters and must be estimated. The MLE method was used to establish the 
estimators of these parameters. These estimators are shown in the appendix.
 Assume that the gold ball shear strength obeys the Weibull distribution; the probability density function, 
cumulative distribution function, and expected value of the Weibull distribution are

where L, a, b, and β are parameters and must be estimated; their MLEs are shown in the appendix. The  11L  is the upper limit of the expected value at t = +∞. 
For the fitting of the forecasting model, the number of observation periods for data collection must be 
determined, and the interval of each period must be the same. Several observations of gold ball shear strength 
per period are necessary for fitting the probability distribution. 
When the period t is infinite, the quality level of IC reaches a stable state, and the characteristic value is 
equal to the upper limit L. Therefore, (12) and (14) at t = +∞ become

Figure 1 shows the growth curve of the characteristic value of the gold ball shear strength. The 
characteristic value of the gold ball shear strength increased to 19.562 grams at t = +∞. The growth of the 
characteristic value slowed after the fifth period. After the 10th period, the characteristic value of the gold ball 
shear strength was approximately L = 19.562 and was almost unchanged. Therefore, the gold ball shear 
strength for the new wire bonding technology will reach the maturity stage after the 10th month.

4.3. Forecasting for the quality level growth of an IC 
The characteristic value η of the Weibull distribution is not equal to its expected value. Although the 
characteristic value η can be used to measure the observation, the expected value was used to measure the data 
or compare various data sets in most industrial cases. Therefore, the expected value was more suitable than 
the characteristic value η to forecast the gold ball shear strength in this study. The expected value of the gold 
ball shear strength at period t can be forecasted by 
 
      tttXE 45.0exp1 6656.1745.0exp1 745.311562.19                                               (21) 
 
The forecasting of the expected value for the gold ball shear strength at the seventh period was       9397.16745.0exp16656.1745.0exp16656.17  t  g. This study collected the 10 
observations of gold ball shear strength at the seventh month to calculate the actual expected value for the 
evaluation of out-of-sample forecasting error; these observations were 24.25, 15.57, 17.82, 13.51, 14.61, 
10.61, 10.99, 20.05, 14.87, and 22.25 g. Using the 10 observations and β = 3.745 in (8), the estimate of 
parameter η at the seventh period is 17.947. Let the parameters β and η of (9) be 3.745 and 17.947, 
respectively. The actual expected value was 16.0273 g. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used 
to measure the forecasting error in prior studies (Erdirencelebi & Yalpir, 2011; Chou, 2011; Chen, 2011; Lin et 
al., 2011; López et al., 2012); therefore, this study also measured the error using MAPE. The MAPE at the 
seventh period was

Because MAPE < 5%, this forecasting model in this case had a high accuracy. This model can be used to 
forecast the future gold ball shear strength value of an IC for the new wire bonding technology. 
In (21), the  11L  is 17.6656 g. It indicates that the expected value of the gold ball shear 
strength will increase to 17.6656 g for the new wire bounding technology. The expected value of the gold ball 
shear strength for the old wire bounding technology was 15.48 g. In this case, the new wire bounding

combines the logistic curve and the probability density function of normal distribution. The likelihood 
function of (11) is

the parameter L can be estimated by calculating (A.6). The estimate of σ2 can be obtained by using periods t, 
sample size nt, observations xit, and the three parameters of the logistic curve in (A.7).

growth stages, the relationship of quality level growth and time exhibits an S-curve. 
Reliability test is a popular method to inspect the quality, and the life of products 
is a main quality variable that must be measured by using reliability test. Because the 
life of products is a larger-the-better quality characteristic, the growth of life depicts 
an S-curve when a new production technology is introduced.  
Statistical process control (SPC) is used widely to monitor the stability of quality 
variable. When the assignable causes occur, the process is abnormality and then the 
quality variable varies. For this case, the number of product defect will increase. SPC 
method can signal the change of this quality variable and operator must find out and 
repair immediately this process abnormality for maintaining quality level. For the 
introduction and growth periods, quality variable is variation because quality level 
increases. If SPC method is used to monitor the process during the two periods, it will 
signal the variation of quality level growth, and it is fruitless. Therefore, an optimal 
time to use the SPC method for controlling process is the maturity period because the 
quality level tends a steady state. When SPC method signals a quality variation during 
the maturity period, it can be determined this variation is from the occurrence of 
assignable causes and then operators must repair immediately the process. If the 
quality variable is life, it is very important to know this time that the life grows and 
reaches the maximal value or a steady state. If this time can be forecasted accurately, 
it is very helpful to obtain a good opportunity to implement the SPC for controlling 
process. 
A growth curve is an empirical model of the evolution of a quantity over time. 
Growth curves are widely used in technology forecasting (Frank, 2004; Rai and 
Kumar, 2003; Meade and Islam, 1995 and 1998; Meyer and Ausubel, 1999; Meyer et 
al., 1999; Levary and Han, 1995). Growth curves are typically divided into 
exponential and S-shaped types, and a simple logistic curve which can perform an 
exponential and an S-type growths is very appropriate to present the quality level 
growth. In reliability test, weibull distribution was widely used to measure the life 
(Bebbington et al., 2007; Hallinan, 1993; Moraisa and Barreto-Souzab, 2011). 
This study develops an evaluation method of quality level growth for product life. 
This evaluation method assumes that the life is a weibull distribution, the 
characteristic life will grow as operational time increase, and the relationship between 
characteristic life and time is a simple logistic model. This study presents a method to 
estimate parameters of this evaluation method with the maximum likelihood estimator. 
A real example of IC packaging process is also given to illustrate the application of 
this evaluation method. 
 
 
2. LOGISTIC GROWTH CURVE 
A logistic function or logistic curve is a common sigmoid curve, given its name 
in 1844 or 1845 by Pierre Francois Verhulst who studied it in relation to population 
growth. It can model the "S-shaped" curve of growth of some population. The initial 
stage of growth is approximately exponential; then, as saturation begins, the growth 
slows, and at maturity, growth stops. 
The simple logistic model is widely used for technology forecasting. Many new 
forecasting models were proposed based on the simple logistic model and include 
innovations such as the Bass diffusion model and extended logistic model (Trappey 
and Wu, 2008; Meade and Islam, 1995).The most important characteristic of simple 
logistic model is that it is symmetric about the point of inflection. This feature

This probability model is called Logistic-Weibull model. When the period tends 
to become infinite, the process will become a stable state, and then the characteristic 
life η is equal to its maximal value L. Therefore, Eqs.(5) and (6) are

3.2. Parameter estimation 
In Eq.(5), four parameters, β, a, band L, must be estimated. The maximum 
likelihood estimator (MLE) method is used to establish the estimators of the four 
parameters. Let xij be the ith sample observation of period j, nj be the sample size of 
period j, the likelihood function of Logistic-Weibull model is

The Eq.(11) is differentiated for each parameter, respectively, and then the Eq.(11) 
yields 
 
destroyed. The maximal shear strength loading is considered as the life of the gold 
ball. The gold ball shear strength is an important characteristic to measure 
wirebonding quality and must be measured to stabilize IC quality. Larger gold ball 
shear strength value indicates more excellent quality or longer life, therefore gold ball 
shear strength is larger-the-better characteristic. 
 
4.2. Analysis and forecasting 
A new wirebonding technology had already been introduced into the process, and 
this process had already begun to operate. We collected 10 gold ball shear strength 
values per month, and duration of collection is half years. These observations (in 
grams) were exhibited in table1.

This study takes these values of table 1 into Eqs.(12)-(15), and let Eqs.(12)-(15) 
be equal to 0. A solver add-in for Microsoft Excel 2010 provides Newton-Raphson 
method to solve nonlinear equations. In this study, the solver add-in for Microsoft 
Excel 2010 is used to solve Eqs.(12)-(15) and then the four parametric estimates of 
Logistic-Weibull model are β=3.745, a=1, b=0.45 and L=19.562, respectively. 
Because L=19.562, the maximal gold ball shear strength value is 19.562 grams when 
the period is tends to become infinite. Therefore, the characteristic life of the gold ball 
in a stable process is 19.562 grams. Because a=1, b=0.45 and L=19.562, the 
characteristic life of the gold ball can be forecasted by 
 
   tt 45.0exp1
562.19
 . 
 
Figure 1 shows the growth curve of characteristic life of gold ball. It can see the 
characteristic life of gold ball will grow to 19.562 grams when the period is tended to 
become infinite. The growth of the characteristic life is obviously slow after 5th 
period. After 10th period, it appears that the characteristic life of the gold ball is 
approximate L=19.562 and almost unchanged. Therefore, the process will be 
approximate a stable state after 10th period, and some statistical process control 
approaches can be used to monitor this process after this period.
