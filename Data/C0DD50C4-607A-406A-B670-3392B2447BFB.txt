2. Theory 
Synthesizing a cylindrical vector beam polarization through the use of a linear 
combination of two orthogonally polarized Hermite-Gaussian TEM01 and TEM10 
beams was proposed by Kongelnik and Li 11). In our experimental design, the mode 
patterns and electric-field directions of the incident beam were not just parallel or 
perpendicular to the plane of incidence; therefore, the formula for the electric field 
had to be modified. If the azimuth of node and polarization of the TEM01 mode were 
set at 45° to the plane of incidence as shown in Fig. 1(a), its field distribution can be 
expressed as 
2 2

             (1) 
Where W is the 1/e intensity beam radius of the Gaussian term, ˆ ˆ( )x yu u is the unit vector 
along x (y) axis. The field distribution can be decomposed into two components, and 
the field distribution along x axis is shown in Fig. 1(b) and can be written as 
2 2

                       (2) 
The mirror image of the y axis is shown in Fig. 1(c), and its field distribution can be 
formulated as 
2 2

é ùæ ö- + ÷çê ú÷= -ç ÷ê úç ÷è øë û
                         (3) 
If one superimposes two beams again, and keeps the phase difference of the two 
modes at zero or a multiple of 2π, the result of the output mode is shown in Fig. 1(d) 
which can be expressed as 
2 2
0

              (4) 
In Fig. 1(d), one can observe that superimposed beam is neither radial nor azimuthal 
polarization. This mode is a kind of inhomogeneous polarization whose azimuth of 
polarization is 45° with respect to the radius. The simple method for converting this 
mode into radial or azimuthal polarization is to make use of a polarization rotator that 
is composed of two half-wave plate 1). The unique feature of the two half-wave plate 
polarization rotator is that the azimuth rotation of the linear polarization is only 
related to the relative fast axes of the two half-wave plates. While we set the relative 
azimuth of the two half-wave plates to be ±22.5°, the output filed distribution gave a 
doughnut beam with radial or azimuthal polarization.

Abstracts: We demonstrated a solid-state Michelson interferometer which transformed linear polarized 
TEM01 mode laser beam to radially polarized beam. Since the system was in solid configuration and made 
up of commercial optical elements, the high stability and quality of radially polarized beam can be 
obtained by us of this apparatus. 
 
Introduction 
   Polarization is one of the most important characteristics of laser 
applications. Currently, the output of the general laser cavity is either 
randomly polarized or linearly polarized. Linearly polarized light is a 
homogenous polarization state, which can be generated by installing optical 
components, such as a Brewster window in a low-power laser or folding 
mirrors in a high-power laser, into the laser cavity. However, there are some 
defects in homogenous polarized beams for laser material processing. For past 
investigations, inhomogeous polarizations, such as radially and azimuthally 
polarized light [1], whose direction of electric field is parallel to radial and 
azimuth separately, could eliminate this drawback. These special laser beams 
that possess axial symmetry in an electric field also have many interesting 
applications. For example, an azimuthally polarized beam could be applied in 
a metallic waveguide transmission with the lowest loss, and a radially 
polarized beam with the fastest process speed could be applied in laser 
material processing for its distinguished merits, which include no aberration, 
a large absorption coefficient in all directions, and a focal point beyond the 
diffraction limit [2]. Furthermore, its strong longitudinal component of an 
electric field is the most intriguing characteristic of this form of polarization. 
This special feature can be used for laser accelerators [3] or particle trapping 
[4]. Although many methods have been reported to produce radially polarized 
light, such as a computer- generated  hologram interferometer [5], 
liquid-crystal polarization converters [6], an intra-cavity axicon in a circular 
laser resonator [7], and diffraction grating in a resonator [8], most of these 
methods use advanced technologies for fabricating unusual devices. 
Interferometric arrangements are a more practical approach to generating 
inhomogeneous polarization. In this paper, we present a Michelson 
interferometric configuration which generates inhomogeneous polarization 
with the feature of being easy to implement, and minimum response to 
environmental turbulence that can stably generate radially polarized light 
beam. 
 
Experiment and results 
   Synthesizing a radial polarization through the use of a linear combination 
of two orthogonally polarized Hermite-Gaussian TEM10 and TEM10 beams 
was proposed by Kongelnik and Li [9].In order to coherently combine the two 
modes, a Michelson interferometer with image inversion components was 
installed to produce the radially polarized beam TEM01＊. The experimental 
setup is shown in Fig.1. A He-Ne Laser (Melles Groit, 05-LPB-670) outputs a 
TEM01 beam with linear polarization. A half-wave plate, whose azimuth is 
adjusted for the output of the S-wave and P-wave with the same amplitude as 
the output of the polarizing beam splitter, is installed after the laser kit. The 
laser beam is expanded by a factor of 5 (the diameter is about 1 cm) after 
passing through a beam expander and then directing into the Michelson 
interferometer. A polarizing beam splitter (PBS) separates the incident beam 
into P- and S-wave components, and two waves propagate through quarter 
wave plates respectively. Then one wave is reflected by mirror, and another 
wave is reflected by a porro prism with lateral displacement of light beams. 
The lateral shift of light beam is made up by a lateral PBS at the output 
channel of first PBS, and as a result two waves are reflected three and four 
times in order to make the output pattern complement each other as a donut 
shape. In addition to the orthogonal polarizations and equal intensities of the 
two beams, the other important requirement for generating radial polarization 
through the use of two superimposed beams was their relative phase must be 
stably kept at zero.
