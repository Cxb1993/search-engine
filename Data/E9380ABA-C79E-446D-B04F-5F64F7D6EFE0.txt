Abstract 
In this report, a novel methodology for designing and analyzing high performance 
sigma-delta leapfrog modulators for ultra-high resolution analog-to-digital (A/D) converters is 
presented. The less sensitive topology, the leapfrog topology, in component variations is analyzed 
by considering the noise transfer function (NTF). By using theoretical analysis, the loop 
coefficients are constrained to a small, clear and definite range called the stable region. With the 
output voltage limited within 2V, an absolutely stable region (ASR) is obtained. A program that 
analyzes and generates the required coefficients is constructed for easily designing this topology. 
For a 256 over-sampling ratio (OSR) and the coefficients from ASR, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) 
and dynamic range (DR) are 105 dB and 100 dB, respectively. In accordance with the behavior 
simulation results, the system is not only stable and efficient but also suitable for high-resolution 
applications.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The sigma-delta modulation has gained much interest as a technique for high resolution and 
performance of A/D converter [1]–[4]. Based on over-sampling method and noise-shaping 
technique, the sigma-delta modulators have more advantages than traditional A/D converters, such 
as high resolution and less matching requirement for the circuit components [1]. In addition to the 
popularity of sigma-delta modulation, various design and analysis methods for various 
architectures have been discussed and proposed [5]–[9]. The process to design a stable system and 
analyze it has become an important issue [10]. In general, the resolution increases when the order 
of the modulator is increased, but the high-order systems suffer from stability problems [1]. 
Searching for the proper modulator loop coefficients is often complicated, time-consuming and 
challenging for novice and veteran designers. Therefore, a novel methodology to search for loop 
coefficients and guarantee modulator stability is required for reducing the design time for these 
systems [11]. 
Many methods have been proposed to find the loop coefficients and to improve modulator 
stability [2], [3], [5], [6], [12]. Among these methods, a multiple loop structure called “Follow the 
Leader” (FL) was used for the benefit of having many coefficients to stabilize the modulator [2]. 
The method for finding the FL loop coefficients is based on fitting the modulator transfer function 
to the filter polynomials, which includes the Butterworth and Chebyshev polynomials [13], in the 
s-domain. Another presented method was designed directly in z-domain by controlling the pole 
and zero locations of transfer function [12]. Other proposed method involved a high-order

plot the stable region constructed by f3 and f4 
 
Using the modified numerical algorithm, the distribution of the stable region (SR) shown in Fig. 2 
is obtained. In this region, many groups of coefficients imply that the NTF poles are within the 
unit circle in the BBBF topology. This means that the coefficients in this region will stabilize the 
BBBF topology.

0.99. “+” denotes the boundary of |z| = 0.98. “*” denotes the boundary of |z| = 0.97. 
3. DESIGN EXAMPLE OF AUTOMATIC COEFFICIENTS GENERATION 
Though the coefficients – f3 and f4 from the SR stabilize the BBBF topology in frequency 
domain, the waveform in time domain must be discussed. For low voltage applications, the output 
voltage limitation within 2V must be obeyed in the each integrator output. The difference 
equation in each integrator is analyzed, especially in the second and third integrators. The 
simulation verifies the idea. The distributions of the output voltage limitation within and outside 
2V are obtained. The distribution of the output voltage limitation within 2V is called as the 
absolute stable region (ASR). The peak SNR is simulated and obtained from the ASR. The set of 
coefficient – f3 and f4 that brings the maximum SNR is also obtained. A program written in 
MATLAB is developed for generating the coefficients – f3 and f4 and for finishing the whole 
simulation.

4. SIMULATION RESULTS 
Fig. 5 shows the power spectrum density of a single tone for the 4th-order BBBF leapfrog 
topology that illustrates the SNR is over 100 dB within the base-band. In this simulation, the third 
harmonic distortion that is 7.5 KHz appears. The magnitude of input signal versus SNR is shown 
in Fig. 6. The peak SNR occurs at –7 dB and the DR is 100 dB. 
The NPG is a key-point for stability considerations [10], [11]. The NPG definition is the 
amplification factor of the quantization noise and is illustrated as ( )( ) ωπ π ω deNTF j

||1 ∫ . A large 
NPG will increase the high frequency noise and cause the modulator to have stability problems [2], 
[3]. A small NPG will cause in-band tones and decrease the SNR [11]. The NPG is also a function 
of the magnitude of the input signal and different architectures. The proper NPG value is simulated 
in many literatures and located between 1.5 and 2.5 [10], [11]. If the system is stable and the NPG 
is a fixed value, it is therefore absolutely stable. 
According to the above NPG concept, the following simulation was developed to check the 
stability of the BBBF leapfrog topology. The input signal magnitude was initially changed 
from –20 dB to 0 dB. The step increments were 1dB. Each input signal magnitude was simulated 
with all of the possible coefficients in the ASR illustrated in Fig. 4. The simulation results show 
that the NPG for each combination (for example, input signal is –17 dB and the coefficient [f2 f3 f4] 
= [0 3.5 4.5]) is two. The fixed NPG value implies that the BBBF leapfrog A/D converter 
combining all the coefficients in the stable region is a very stable system. At the same time, these 
results guarantee that the proposed methodology, listed in previous section, is excellent and very 
efficient for the novice and veteran circuit designer to design the leapfrog topology for the 
sigma-delta A/D converter. 
According to the sensitivity concept [13], simulation results are obtained to prove that the 
variations in components do not affect the performance severely; that is, the variability in 
performance measure is very small. Fig. 7 depicts the distribution of SNR variation with the two 
coefficients, f3 and f4, changed by 10 % using Monte-Carlo simulation. The result illustrates that ±

sigma-delta A/D converters.
