Feedback-driven Context Selection (FCS) [9] made 
adaptation prediction for a user based on the history of 
the community of users and reflect both the user’s 
context and content’s usage semantics. The TF/IDF 
weight [10] (term frequency–inverse document 
frequency) is a weight often used in information 
retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical 
measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a 
document in a collection or corpus. The importance 
increases proportionally to the number of times a word 
appears in the document but is offset by the frequency 
of the word in the corpus.  
 
III. PROPOSED M-LEARNING MODULES 
There are four main modules proposed to carry out 
the course caching strategy and presentation adaptation 
methods that aim at promoting the immediacy, 
accessibility, and interactivity for SCORM-compliance 
mobile learning environment. The Fig.1 depicts the 
entire framework which based on Web Service and 
Context-Aware technologies to develop the four 
modules. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Proposed Web Service based modules for m-learning 
systems 
 
A. Course Segmentation Module 
As shown in Fig. 2, a course activity tree can be 
separated into several smaller cluster units which 
considered as a basic building block of learning activity. 
SCORM sequencing is especially applied to clusters. 
The cluster includes a parent learning activity and its 
immediate children. The parent activity of the cluster 
will contain the learning sequencing information. The 
children can be a set of leaf learning activities which 
are the physical learning resources for delivering to 
learners. 
 
 
Fig. 2. An illustration of Clusters within a Course 
 
In our proposed strategies, a cluster can be 
considered as the basic unit to be manipulated. 
According to the definition of a cluster, the module 
segments the course structure that includes a parent 
learning activity and its immediate children. Thus, 
there are five clusters can be separated from the 
navigation tree and the parent activity of the cluster 
will contain the learning sequencing information. 
 
B. Course Presentation Adaptation Module 
The module is composed of three main 
adaptation models. First, the textual adaptation model 
is responsible for handling the complicated textual 
body that may make users feel confused or lost while 
reading on a restricted small screen. We referenced 
progressive disclosure [11]  for text, it combined with 
keywords and a summary help present the original 
content incrementally, has the best improvement of 
average I/O expenditure and completion time across all 
tasks. Our adaptation unit is a PU and only when its 
TID is higher than the chosen threshold value will it 
trigger the adaptation process.  
 
1) Semantic Unit (SU) and Presentation Unit (PU) 
The adaptation process begins by partitioning the 
content into presentation unites (PUs). A content page 
will be separated into several PUs, which instead of 
presenting in the actual HTML, each PU is a rectangle 
around a section which typically presents a paragraph, 
list, table, image, etc. Accordingly, each PU is 
considered as a basic unit of the adaptation process. 
Because each PU contains various contents, the 
question is which SU should execute the adaptation 
process. We will define the other unit, namely screen 
unit (SU), that helps us to evaluate and decide which 
PU is required to be adapted. 
The display area size of a PU is varies because it 
may contain a paragraph or an image; a SU is a virtual 
rectangle presentation block where the boundary is 
fixed according to different handhelds displaying 
 
Fig. 4. Processing of the learning content adaptation 
 
3) Image adaptation Model 
Similarly, image adaptation replies on comparing 
its size to a SU’s. Recall the definition of SU. It is a 
rectangle displaying unit and its presentation area is the 
same as a physical screen area of required handhelds. 
An image may not be able to adapt its size to perfectly 
match the proportion of a SU and reside in it. Hence, a 
large image (its height and width are all exceed a PU’s) 
might be shrunk proportionately until its width is fit to 
display in a PU without additional horizontal scrolling 
action. The entire adapted content will have the default 
displaying in a single column where vertical scrolling 
for browsing is necessary, so the height of a image 
beyond a SU’s is acceptable. Accordingly, a small 
image will be enlarged proportionately until its width, 
is at least fit, to display in a PU without additional 
scrolling actions. 
 
4) Layout Adaptation Model 
The presentation adaptation mode provides two 
main functions for user to reedit the content’s layout. 
One is allowing users to pick up PUs to delete, the 
other is let users rearrange PUs’ position manually. 
After the previous automatic adaptation, each PU 
should contain appropriate displaying content-content 
that has either been adapted or not. A few PUs might 
be required to be eliminated, because they may present 
relatively insignificant objects such as pictures 
decorated only for aesthetic purposes in its original 
content. Besides, users may decide to delete certain 
PUs considered unnecessary for learning according to 
their editing experience, and consequently reduce the 
content’s size. 
 
C. Course Caching Module 
The course caching module is mainly applied to 
mobile learning applications with very limited 
bandwidth or impermanent network environments. The 
system can be automatically executed as a daemon 
program without human control. It is similar to virtual 
memory management in conventional operating 
systems that can provide a virtual network environment 
so that the cached clusters are sufficient for learner’s 
requirements even stays at offline status. It mainly 
addresses the suspension due to the intermittent 
network connection. In contrast, the other purpose is 
similar to caching of disk. This mode can prepare the 
possible incoming learning resources in advance to 
avoid the time-consuming process of downloading the 
required contents. 
 
1) Course Download/Replacement Management 
The primary task of the download management 
model is to create the downloading order of clusters. 
This is the main function that affects the efficiency of 
the course caching system. When an appropriate order 
is created by the download management model, the 
client can avoid unnecessary downloading and 
replacement of the learning contents. The download 
management flow chart is illustrated in Fig. 5. 
 
 
Fig. 5. Flow Chart of Download Management Model 
The replacement management model is a 
function on the client side. It will drop some clusters 
automatically when the assigned storage capacity of the 
learning device reaches its limit and new clusters are 
requested. The flow chart of the replacement model is 
illustrated in Fig 6. In order to prevent the omission of 
some clusters that might be necessary for the incoming 
learning activities, it is important for this model to 
make a good decision. Furthermore, a good course 
caching system should not spend a considerable 
amount of time on swap in and swap out operations.

the course caching strategy and presentation adaptation 
methods that aim at promoting the immediacy, 
accessibility, and interactivity for SCORM-compliance 
mobile learning environment. The Fig.1 depicts the 
entire framework which based on Web Service and

separated into several smaller cluster units which

SCORM sequencing is especially applied to clusters. 
The cluster includes a parent learning activity and its

According to the definition of a cluster, the module 
segments the course structure that includes a parent 
learning activity and its immediate children. Thus, 
there are five clusters can be separated from the 
navigation tree and the parent activity of the cluster 
will contain the learning sequencing information. 
 
B. Course Presentation Adaptation Module 
The module is composed of three main 
adaptation models. First, the textual adaptation model 
is responsible for handling the complicated textual 
body that may make users feel confused or lost while 
reading on a restricted small screen. We referenced 
progressive disclosure [11]  for text, it combined with 
keywords and a summary help present the original 
content incrementally, has the best improvement of 
average I/O expenditure and completion time across all 
tasks. Our adaptation unit is a PU and only when its 
TID is higher than the chosen threshold value will it 
trigger the adaptation process.  
 
1) Semantic Unit (SU) and Presentation Unit (PU) 
The adaptation process begins by partitioning the 
content into presentation unites (PUs). A content page 
will be separated into several PUs, which instead of 
presenting in the actual HTML, each PU is a rectangle 
around a section which typically presents a paragraph, 
list, table, image, etc. Accordingly, each PU is 
considered as a basic unit of the adaptation process. 
Because each PU contains various contents, the 
question is which SU should execute the adaptation 
process. We will define the other unit, namely screen 
unit (SU), that helps us to evaluate and decide which 
PU is required to be adapted. 
The display area size of a PU is varies because it 
may contain a paragraph or an image; a SU is a virtual 
rectangle presentation block where the boundary is 
fixed according to different handhelds displaying 
 
Fig. 4. Processing of the learning content adaptation 
 
3) Image adaptation Model 
Similarly, image adaptation replies on comparing 
its size to a SU’s. Recall the definition of SU. It is a 
rectangle displaying unit and its presentation area is the 
same as a physical screen area of required handhelds. 
An image may not be able to adapt its size to perfectly 
match the proportion of a SU and reside in it. Hence, a 
large image (its height and width are all exceed a PU’s) 
might be shrunk proportionately until its width is fit to 
display in a PU without additional horizontal scrolling 
action. The entire adapted content will have the default 
displaying in a single column where vertical scrolling 
for browsing is necessary, so the height of a image 
beyond a SU’s is acceptable. Accordingly, a small 
image will be enlarged proportionately until its width, 
is at least fit, to display in a PU without additional 
scrolling actions. 
 
4) Layout Adaptation Model 
The presentation adaptation mode provides two 
main functions for user to reedit the content’s layout. 
One is allowing users to pick up PUs to delete, the 
other is let users rearrange PUs’ position manually. 
After the previous automatic adaptation, each PU 
should contain appropriate displaying content-content 
that has either been adapted or not. A few PUs might 
be required to be eliminated, because they may present 
relatively insignificant objects such as pictures 
decorated only for aesthetic purposes in its original 
content. Besides, users may decide to delete certain 
PUs considered unnecessary for learning according to 
their editing experience, and consequently reduce the 
content’s size. 
 
C. Course Caching Module 
The course caching module is mainly applied to 
mobile learning applications with very limited 
bandwidth or impermanent network environments. The 
system can be automatically executed as a daemon 
program without human control. It is similar to virtual 
memory management in conventional operating 
systems that can provide a virtual network environment 
so that the cached clusters are sufficient for learner’s 
requirements even stays at offline status. It mainly 
addresses the suspension due to the intermittent 
network connection. In contrast, the other purpose is 
similar to caching of disk. This mode can prepare the 
possible incoming learning resources in advance to 
avoid the time-consuming process of downloading the 
required contents. 
 
1) Course Download/Replacement Management 
The primary task of the download management 
model is to create the downloading order of clusters. 
This is the main function that affects the efficiency of 
the course caching system. When an appropriate order 
is created by the download management model, the 
client can avoid unnecessary downloading and 
replacement of the learning contents. The download 
management flow chart is illustrated in Fig. 5. 
 
 
Fig. 5. Flow Chart of Download Management Model 
The replacement management model is a 
function on the client side. It will drop some clusters 
automatically when the assigned storage capacity of the 
learning device reaches its limit and new clusters are 
requested. The flow chart of the replacement model is 
illustrated in Fig 6. In order to prevent the omission of 
some clusters that might be necessary for the incoming 
learning activities, it is important for this model to 
make a good decision. Furthermore, a good course 
caching system should not spend a considerable 
amount of time on swap in and swap out operations.
