Abstract 
 
Comparative Genomic Hybridization is a powerful and now widely used technique for detecting 
genetic abnormalities. cDNAmicroarrays is such a genome-scale measurement with 
readily-available technology, where it provide an extremely valuable technique in identifying the 
complex genetic changes occurring in many cancers, and has potential benefit in identifying subtle 
congenital abnormalities. cDNAmicroarrays is a useful tool to carry out massively parallel analysis 
of gene expression on tens of thousands of genes from a given sample. However, questions such as 
what level of the fluorescence intensity of cDNA microarrays is deem as significant, and quantify 
the correct expression level still need to be addressed.  This project is aim to design a scheme and 
a Statistical model that can be used to detect minor variation in the expression profiles of genes, 
where further information can be extracted to be used for analysis. We aim to address the concern 
on the quality of such expression data (using data from Genomic Medicine Research Core 
Laboratory of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital) - issues on hybridization and probes (in particular, 
we want to address the effect of cross hybridization), where we aim to quantify the transcript levels 
of expression from the fluorescence intensity of each probe on a cDNAmicroarray.

conserved sequences shared by two or more cDNAs such as gene family members, which we 
denote as Type B error [1, 6, 16]. 
 
This study is aimed to design a scheme or a Statistical model that can be used to detect minor 
variation in the expression profiles of genes from cDNA microarrays, where more robust scheme is 
used to extract further information to be used for analysis.  We aim to address the concern on the 
quality of such expression data (using data from an earlier version of in-house microarray from 
Genomic Medicine Research Core Laboratory of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital) - issues on 
hybridization and probes (in particular, we want to address the effect of cross hybridization), where 
we aim to quantify the transcript levels of expression from the fluorescence intensity of each probe 
on a cDNA microarray; the scheme or model should be able to incorporate further aspects of data 
that derived from such a dynamic system: 
1. A microarray intensity data is a record of an instance of cells or body functions at a particular 
time, therefore by simply observing the intensity of probes on a microarray to determine 
whether the corresponding genes are up regulated or down regulated might not provide the 
whole pictures.   
2. Data contain many noises and errors from various sources, therefore strenuous pre-selection 
processes of probes are needed and various sources of errors need to be identified. 
3. A gene expressions’ intensity might vary, based on the corresponding functions of that 
particular gene maintain, hence a scheme that can differentiate gene’s true expression status is 
needed. 
4. Variations in the physical attributes of each probe might affect the true expression of 
corresponding gene captured on the microarray, especially for the cDNA microarray type of 
data.  
 
Method and Materials  
 
In the first year of this study, we first commence by building a database of sequence 
similarities of probes on the in-house cDNA microarray systems used in the GMRCL of Chang 
Gung Memorial Hospital, where we use the BLAST algorithm to identify the candidate probes that 
might have cross hybridization phenomena, by identifying matched base length.  Based on the 
empirical study on some sets of cDNA microarray data, we are able to verify the existence of cross 
hybridization phenomena.  Then this study has achieved the following preliminary results: 
1. Constructing a library that contains information on cross hybridization of probes of the 
in-house cDNA microarray systems used in the GMRCL of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. 
2. Applied Statistical tests proposed in [7] to verify evidences of cross-hybridization of those 
probes on the arrays. 
3. Using association rules mining method to clustering and verify probes that have cross 
hybridization’s interaction that might confounding the intensity of the probes (confounding 
factors).

was more flexible and the array might contain probes that possess the appropriate characteristics.    
 
Nielsen et. al. [11] have demonstrated that family genes with sequence similarity of 70-80% 
will display phenomena of cross hybridization. Next, Kane et. al. [9] used synthetic 50mer 
oligonucleotide and shown that non-target sequences with >75-80% identical to the 50mer probes 
in microarrays could result in cross hybridization also.  The seriousness of cross hybridization 
occurring on an array is that it might provide false signals, through hybridization of none targeted 
RNAs onto a probe, which will lead to the possibility that a clustering analysis could categorize 
genes with regions of sequence similarity together with genes of similar expression profile, which 
might lead to misinterpretation of genes' transcriptional response and unable to define the correct 
pathway.  Moreover, with variations in the probe intensities, genes with significant expression 
profiles might be confounded by the cross hybridization effects and hence rendered the array data 
to be inefficient.  Consequently, to analysis microarray data, we should try to capture or eliminate 
the effect of cross hybridization through Statistical models. 
 
Although sequence similarity is not the only factor that causes cross hybridization, from the 
preceding studies, it might be a main source of contributor for long probes such as those used on 
cDNA microarrays.  Therefore, in this study will be focusing on the effect of cross hybridization 
from the aspect of sequence similarity.   
 
Using the7334 positively verified sequences of probes, form the IMAGE library of Incyte 
Genomics[14], on CGMH’s Genomic Medicine Research Core Laboratory’s spotted cDNA 
microarray.  We then submitted the sequence data of each probe to the BLASTN algorithm of 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), using the Human’s mRNA database, a set 
of unique probes and sets probes that have the potential of cross hybridization (contain similar 
sequence identity with at least two of genes) were identified. We implement a batch queries 
scheme, called the “batchBLAST”, to facilitate the process of accessing BLAST algorithm and 
usages of the non-redundant nucleotide database of NCBI, where a putative cross hybridization 
gene database is been constructed, where various relevant blast output such as the E value, 
UniGene hyperlink (human version 176), the probe length etc. is automatically extract and record, 
as shown in figure 1.  The schematic flow diagram of batchBLAST is shown in figure 2.  The 
batchBLAST program using JDK1.4.2 and store the return information into a database, using 
MySQL 1.4.0 software.  
 
Below is a summarized Statistics of CGMH’s Genomic Medicine Research Core Laboratory’s 
spotted cDNA array stem from the batchBLAST program:  The probe- length ranged from 500bp 
to 1000bp or greater.  Approximately 87% of these probes have positively matched with sequence 
from NCBI’s Homo sapiens non-redundant genomic database and with aligned length greater than 
200bp.  Furthermore, GC content of these probes ranged from 40% to 60%.  We also found the 
number of nonhuman gene probe is 317, the number of probes that matched to one gene is 2599 
(36% of total probes), matched to two genes is 817 (11% of total probes), matched to three genes is

NTITM to align each probe with its targeting sequence, where we record the starting position of 
each probe with respect to the targeting sequence.  We categorized the probes into various classes, 
based on its corresponding positions.  We then investigate whether the probes exhibited different 
level of differential expressions.   
 
Result 
 
CGMH’s Genomic Medicine Research Core Laboratory’s spotted cDNA array’s probe-length 
ranged from 500 to 1000bp or greater, as summarized in figure 3.  Furthermore, approximately 
87% of these probes have positively matched sequence-length greater than 200bp (shown in figure 
4) and GC content of these probes ranged form 40% to 60%. 
 
Based on the genomic database on Homo sapiens, we found the number of nonhuman gene 
probe is 317 (4% of total probes), match to one gene is 2599 (36% of total probes), match to two 
genes is 817 (11% of total probes), and match to three genes is 826 (11% of total probes). The 
complete probes match Statistic on numbers of gene targets is summarized and listed in Table 1.  
Observed from the above summary, it is obvious that some of probes on the array might be target 
nonspecific, since there are probes that might be hybridized by multiple genes.  Therefore the 
foremost goal is to determine the gene that is designated or designed for each nonspecific probe; 
such matched gene will be annotated as the "primary target" (PT) for the probe.   
 
The primary criteria for identify primary target for a nonspecific probe are based on lengths of 
matched fragments and the value of similarity among all sequences from the BLAST record; a 
primary target will have the longest matched length and largest similarity value.  Using the above 
mentioned two criteria to identify the primary target for all the probes and summarized the result in 
Table 2.  As expected, the length and similarity of majority of primary targets is above 500bp and 
over 90% respectively, see figure 4.  
 
Next, using the organized data, the gene-specific probes on this array are identified; a 
gene-specific probe is a probe that matches with a unique gene from the BLAST record.  About 
63% of gene-specific probes have the perfect match sequence length over 500bp with the 
corresponding target genes (see figure 4a for a summary).  Furthermore, as observed from figure 
4b, the similarities score for those gene-specific probes are larger than 80%.  The identification of 
such gene-specific genes is vital for the second stage of this study, where a chief goal is to quantify 
the effect of cross hybridization on the intensity of a probe.  Assume that only cDNA from a 
specific target can be hybridized onto such a probe, and then we can rely on the reading of such a 
probe and use the reading as reference value in building our model.  
 
Next aspect that needs to be address is the question "What are the necessary conditions that 
warrant cross hybridization".  To initiate this investigation, we identify set of probes that match 
two possible candidate target genes, in such a case, one of the candidate target genes will be 
 X
Next aspect that this study needs to address is to test and quantify the effect of cross 
hybridization on the intensity of probe's signal.  In the following section, we will denote a gene 
specific probe as probe A and its corresponding non-specific probe that has the potential of cross 
hybridized with primary target of the gene specific probe as probe B.  We will conduct an a priori 
algorithm to find association rules where probe A together with probe B both have high log ratio or 
low log ratio, where we hypothesis that cross hybridization phenomenon might have occurred 
between this pair of probes.  However, this is not the only cross hybridization phenomenon that 
might occurs, we still have the case when cross hybridization causes the signal to saturate and 
reduce the probes to be insufficient, i.e. the case probe A highly expressed and probe B do not, 
probe B highly expressed and probe A do not, and both probe A and probe B do not show 
differential expressions; all those case can not be detected by a priori method.  
 
Three sets of different experiment condition microarray data sets are used in the association 
study, where one data set contains 9 arrays and the others two sets contain 6 arrays each. The 
resulting rules are then confirmed with the corresponding Affymetrix data.  Follow the schema 
proposed in [4], the top 10 percentile and bottom 10 percentile of probes (approximately 1000 
probes) from each array are used in the association rule algorithms, where we get captured 
enormous amount of association rules the a priori program [5].  The preliminary results of 
association rules, we have further identified two association rules that corresponded to our 
hypothesis, with support value ranging from 16% to 33% and confident value of 100%.  However, 
such performances can not validate our suspicion of the effect of cross hybridization on the 
intensity of the probes (we were expect much better performance than this).  
 
Conclusion 
 
The preliminary result obtained from this class of probe sets seem to indicate that cross 
hybridization might have profound effect on the readings of cDNA microarray, when the 
non-targeted sequence has similarity >80% and match length at least 300bp, which corresponding 
to the founding in [8].  This conclusion is based on the numerous groups of selected probe sets, 
where each set contains a gene specific probe and a non-specific probe that has the potential of 
cross hybridized with primary target of the gene specific probe.  Whereas the lesser stringent 
candidate probes shown much or no clear indication of cross hybridization, however, they do 
exhibit sign of inconsistency in general, but we have no strong evidence to contribute this 
phenomenon to that of the effect of cross hybridization. 
 
In this study we were hoping to use the reading obtained from the probes that can be found on 
both AffyMetrix and cDNA arrays ; we try to use the data from AffyMetrix data to confirm the 
validality of the gene expression data on cDNA arrays.  However, after a close inspection and 
in-depth analysis, we found that consistency of unique probes on GMRCL’s cDNA array with 
respect to the corresponding reading on AffyMetrix is about approximately 60 to 70%, which 
matches with results published by another study.  The verification process is further exacerbated
