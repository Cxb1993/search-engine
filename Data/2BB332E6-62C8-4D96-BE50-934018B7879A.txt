ABSTRACT 
The technique using thermoacoustic effect to 
move heat from one reservoir to another reservoir 
for cooling need have gradually emphasized a 
novel approach to thermal management in the 
electric devices. This is because of simple structure, 
efficiency, environmental safety, and high heat 
transfer rate. A miniature acoustic cooler without 
water-cooling heat exchanger is such a device case, 
which utilizes piezoelectric driver to create sound 
wave and have a mini-scale size.The purpose of 
this study is to develop a miniature acoustic cooler 
for electronic cooling by implementation. Then a 
numerically and experimentally study is performed 
to explored the mechanism of related 
thermoacoustic operation and its characteristics of 
electronic cooling. In addition, the effects of 
various design parameters (e.g., input power of 
piezoelectric driver, gas-filling pressure, working 
fluid, and stack geometry) on the temperature 
difference exists on both end sides of the stack, and 
on cooling of electronic component are 
analyzed.The research results show that the 
phenomenon of thermoacoustic effect exists on the 
porous stack, i.e., there is a temperature gradient 
along the stack. The maximum temperature 
difference existing on the whole stack increases 
with increasing input power of piezoelectric driver, 
and gas-filling pressure, and increases with 
decreasing Prandtl number of the gas.. Furthermore, 
it was found that the better the thermoacoustic 
effect that the acoustic cooler has, the better the 
cooling capacity which reduces the maximum 
temperature appearing in the interior of electronic 
component and prolongs its life in use.

一 前言  
隨著現今科技的進步，各類電子產品均朝
向高能量及小體積發展，而且藉由製程的改良，
使得電子元件體積越做越精細，連帶產生的散熱
問題也隨之而生，尤其電腦的中央處理器（CPU）
及晶片組的單位面積內之有效電晶體數迅速增
加，如何解決高發熱量電子儀器設備的散熱問
題，是一個頗受重視的課題。聲波冷卻器是一種
新的熱傳技術，熱聲冷卻技術利用聲波進行電子
元件的冷卻散熱管理，由於系統構造簡單，使用

【解析區域之邊界條件】 
1.共振管內上、下兩壁面及右側面滿足無滑
動條件 v=0，當 t 0≧ ，管壁維持等室溫 299K。
2.左側面（x=0）振盪壓力為
     0, cos 2 sinOP x t P x t   ，：角頻率； 
P0為壓力振幅；y 方向速度 v=0，當 t＞0。 
【初始條件】t=0，共振管內壓力、速度、溫度、
密度分別為 P=Pm，u=0，T=Tm 
在數值方法求解上，本文採用 Patankar 的有
限體積法，配合混合法則，並以 SIMPLEC 法則
計算整個求解過程。這個數值計算過程使用熱流
分析軟體CFDRC來求解整個共振腔內之非穩態
振盪之流場、壓力場與溫度場。 
三、實驗測試 
(1)實驗模型結構 
本機型結構為參考 Symko[6]的文獻，根據
聲速公式 
   k pa k R T f              (10) 
固定頻率後設計出二分之ㄧ波長的共振腔長
度，其總長為 48.2mm，片堆採用 PE 材質長度
為 4mm，冷熱兩端熱交換器長度為 2mm，半徑
皆為 30mm，以空氣為工作流體，充填壓力為
1atm，壓電型揚聲器震盪頻率為 3600Hz，其產
生振盪壓力為 3%，環境與氣體溫度為 299K。圖
二所示為本聲波冷卻器系統示意圖
 (2)實驗量測 
當運作時，使用壓力感測器量測共振腔體內
是否有壓力變化，使用自動掃頻震盪器供給電壓
及頻率給壓電型揚聲器，使用 T 型熱電偶量測片
堆兩端溫度的變化，其實驗量測系統如圖三。 
四、結果與討論 
在進行研究分析之前，為驗證此數值系統準
確性與可靠度，將先進行(a)網格獨立、(b) 時間
格點獨立及(c)數值驗證工作。其中與本身所建構
之聲波電子冷卻系統(如圖三所示)實驗值，作為
此數值模擬準確性評估用。在網格獨立評估中，
本文採用數種不等間距的交錯格點，如圖四所
示。經由計算結果發現於多孔質片堆區使用
40×40（總格點數 10373）的網格布局如表一，
時間間隔設定為系統週期之三十分之一，數值計
算時間最省又計算結果亦可被接受如表二。另為
證實先前所推導之數值模式的準確性，本研究採
用以數值模組相同結構之聲波冷卻器，如圖二所
示，作數值模擬計算結果與其實驗數據作比對，
結果如圖五所示，可知本數值模擬結果與實驗結
果相差約 1K，而隨著振盪壓力變化在片堆兩端
溫差的變化趨勢相同。此證明本數值模式準確可
行。另由圖五中可知片堆冷（熱）端之溫度在聲
波壓力振盪下，會隨著時間逐漸下降（上升），
約在 5分鐘後即達平衡狀態，維持穩定之溫差。
這是由於工作流體在駐波之驅動下於片堆中來
回移動過程時，不斷從片堆一端吸取熱量並傳至
片堆另一端，使的受熱的一端溫度逐漸增加（即
為熱端），散熱的一端溫度逐漸下降（即為冷端）
所致，而冷熱端溫差大小主要與造成熱聲效應強
弱之因素有關。 
接著利用數值模擬的方法將腔體內的駐波
壓力與速度分佈圖顯示出來，再分別改變充氣壓
力，振盪壓力與工作流體等不同的設計參數，探
討其對熱聲效應的效果與對電子發熱體的影響。 
4.1 聲波冷卻器共振腔內之駐波壓力、速度分布 
圖六為共振腔內壓力分布隨時間變化，從圖
六可以發現在沿共振腔長度方向壓力分布隨時
間呈週期性上下來回振盪變化，在左端靠近壓電
片端有最大與最小壓力值，沿著 x軸往右，壓力
逐漸減小（增大），中間位置有壓力交會的現象
即為駐波壓力節點，但由於受到多孔材片堆區壓
降的影響，以致於壓力節點沒辦法全部交於一
點。圖七為沿共振腔中心線速度隨時間呈週期性
上下來回振盪變化，在靠近 PZT 端和共振腔末
端附近有一速度為零之停滯點。這樣壓力、速度
變化符合本駐波型聲波冷卻器基本條件。圖八為
多孔質片堆內部溫度分布隨時間之變化。當系統
還沒開始運作時，多孔質片堆內部為均溫等於初
始的充氣溫度。當活塞開始振盪，熱聲效應隨之
產生，於是在多孔質片堆左端溫度上升而右端溫
度下降，所以開始產生冷熱兩端溫差。由於一開
始熱聲效應所產生的熱傳還不夠，所以冷熱兩端
的溫降與溫升都不大，且多孔質片堆中間還有一
大部分維持在等溫的情況。但隨著系統運作時間
增加，多孔質片堆內熱聲效應的累積，熱端溫度
持續上升而冷端溫度繼續下降，於是中間等溫部
份逐漸縮小，到最後完全消失。此時沿著片堆的
溫度分布約略呈線性分布。圖九為系統達到穩定
時，經由熱源、熱端熱交換器、冷端熱交換器及
部分腔體(及熱量由熱源至散熱片之傳導)溫度

INTRODUCTION
Increasing efforts has been devoted to thermal
control of electronic equipment and devices by
investigators in the past decades. This interest is due to
the requirement of maintenance of relatively constant
electronic component temperature equal to or below a
maximum operation temperature. For reliable operation,
different high-effective cooling techniques [1] have been
used to obtain a well-controlled thermal environment,
including the traditional methods of natural, forced, and
mixed convective cooling. One of the promising
techniques is the application of a porous material owing
to its larger contact surfaces with fluid and porous-
induced flow mixing, which enhances heat transfer
performance.
There have been significantly increasing numbers of
studies of heat transfer induced by mixed convection in
fluid-saturated porous media owing to the presence of
porous media in diverse engineering applications, such
as the thermal insulation, solid-matrix heat exchanger,
geothermal energy systems, solar power collectors, dry
processes, food processing, electronic system cooling,
etc. Recent Comprehensive reviews of mixed convection
in porous media were revealed by Nield and Bejan [2]
and Vafai [3]. For the mixed convection in a vertical
channel fully/partially packed with a porous material,
Koh and Colony [4] modeled the microstructures of
integrated circuits as a vertical channel filled with porous
media to investigate the heat transfer by using Darcy’s
law. Tien and kuo [5] simulated the same cooling system
based on the modified Darcy’s equation to demonstrate
the significance of no-slip boundary conditions. It is
found that porous media can also be implemented as a
suitable model to deal with electronic system cooling in
microstructures. Kuo and Lu [6] studied the fully
developed laminar mixed convection problems with
different kinds of thermal boundary conditions. Hadim
[7] reported a mixed convection in a vertical porous
channel maintained at uniform wall temperature to
explore the evolution of mixed convection in the
entrance region using Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended
Darcy model. The fully developed mixed convection in a
vertical porous channel with imposed uniform heat flux
was solved by Chen et al. [8] using same model. Chang
and Chang [9] conducted a numerical study of
developing mixed convection in a vertical channel
partially filled with porous media of high permeability.
Their results showed that local heat transfer rate
increases as the porous layer thickness decreases and
Darcy and Grashof numbers increase.
More recent, the heat transfer of a vertical fully/partially
porous channel with discrete heater was of special
interest due to its applications on the cooling of
electronics. Lai et al. [10] numerically analyzed mixed
convection in a vertical porous layer with a finite wall
heat source using Darcy’s law. They found that a
recirculation secondary flow exists in the channel. For an
aiding flow the heat transfer rate increases monotonically
with the aiding velocity and for the opposing flow with
increasing Peclet number the heat transfer rate first
decreases and reaches a minimum before starting to
increase again. Hadim and Chen [11] solved the problem
of buoyancy-assisted mixed convection in a vertical
porous channel with discrete heat sources on one wall
using the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy model.
Their results indicate that as the Darcy number is
decreased, the location of flow separation from the cold
wall did not change while reattachment moved further
downstream. The heat transfer rate increased with
decreasing Darcy number and the effect of Darcy number
is more pronounced over the first heat source. Huang et
al. [12] performed a numerical study on the mixed
convection of multiple heat sources mounted with porous
blocks in a vertical parallel-plate channel. They
concluded that the recirculating flow induced by porous
block make significant changes in the cooling of strip
heater, especially at both trailing and leading edges of
heaters. Most of these studies relate to the aspect of
mixed convection over the porous/fluid composite
system in a vertical channel, however, very little is
known about the problem combining mixed convection
in a fluid/porous composite system and conduction in the
solid region due to the complex geometry and the
different thermal properties among the composite
system. This constitutes a case for mixed convection
over a fluid/porous/solid composite system in a vertical
channel, such as a finite-sized porous substance
enclosing a block where the block is used to simulate
heated electronic component while the porous cover
simulate the porous heat sink.
4Grashof number Grf, and Darcy number Da are related
by Greff = GrfDa/λeff, where λeff=keff/kf, keff is the
effective conductivity of porous medium and kf is
thermal conductivity of the fluid. The stream function
 and vorticity , respectively, which are related to
the fluid velocity components u and v, are defined in
the usual way

The associated boundary conditions necessary to
complete the formulation of the problem are as
follows. The boundary conditions for the configuration
shown in Fig. 1(a) are such that the no-slip condition
occurs at the two impermeable walls. At the channel
inlet, the fluid has an upward fully developed, parabolic
velocity profile of uniform temperature distribution Ti.
At the right wall, there is a uniform volumetric heat
generation rate over each heat blocks. The right and left
channel walls are entirely insulated. At the channel exit,
the boundary condition was determined by the fully
developed condition. At the porous/solid interface, the
no-slip condition and the continuities of temperature and
heat flux are taken into account. At the porous/fluid
interface, the following quantities evaluated in both the
porous and fluid regions are matched: horizontal and
vertical velocities, normal and shear stresses,
temperature, pressure, and heat flux. In summary, the
boundary conditions can be described in the following

where  is the overall exposed area of the block.
To obtain the solution of foregoing system of equations,
the region of interest is overlaid with a variable grid
system. This grid system was designed to capture the
steep gradients near the porous/fluid as well as
porous/solid interfaces, and to provide sufficient grid
density at the solid-block surfaces with minimal element
distortion. Applying the central differencing for the
diffusion terms and the second upwind differencing for
the convective terms, the finite-difference form of the
vorticity transport, stream function and the energy
equations were derived by control-volume integration of
these differential equations over discrete cells
surrounding any given grid point, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
This results in a system of equations of the following
form:
 SCCCCC WWEESSNNcc  (18)
Where  stands for the transport variables. C are
coefficients combining convective and diffusive terms.
S is the appropriate source term. The subscripts on C
denote the main grid points surrounded by the four
neighboring points denoted as N, S, E, and W. The finite
difference equations for *, * , and *T obtained in this
manner were solved by the extrapolated-Jacobi scheme.
This iterative scheme is based on a double-cyclic routine,
which translates into a sweep of only half of the grid
points at each iteration step (Adams and Ortega [15]). In
this study convergence was considered to have been
achieved when the absolute value of relative error on
each grid point between two successive iterations was
found to be less than 10-6.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, the effects of governing physical
parameters, such as the Darcy number (Da), inertial
parameter (Λ), Reynolds number (Re), Grashof number
(Grf), porous-to-fluid thermal conductivity ratio
(λeff=keff/kf), and two geometrical parameters ( pH ) and
( 
pS ) on the flow field, temperature field, local Nusselt
number distribution and overall mean Nusselt number
were examined. The fixed input parameters for all cases
in the simulations were 
sH = 0.2,

sW =0.25, sS =1.0, λs
=10 *iL =4, and Pr=0.7 (The cooling fluid in the study is
air). Because these basic dimensionless parameters are
required to characterize the system, a comprehensive
analysis of various combinations of these parameters was
done. Note that for illustrating the flow and temperature
fields near the heated block array clearly, only this region
and its vicinity were presented. However, at all time, the
computational domain includes a larger region than what
is displayed in the subsequent figures. In addition, for the
sake of brevity, the main features and characteristics of
some of the results are discussed and the corresponding
figures are not presented. The effects of a porous-
covering block array on the fluid flow and thermal
convection heat transfer are illustrated in Figs. 3(a)-(c)
for a typical case with Da=510-5, Re=500, Λ=0.35,
Grf=2.5104, λs = 10, λeff=1, pH =0.25, pW =0.5, pS =
0.5, 
sS =1 and *oL =32. Several interesting features are
found from these plots. The presence of the porous-
covering block array causes the streamlines to bend
significantly in the channel (Fig. 4(a)). The velocity
distribution is parabolic at both the entrance and exit of
the channel. However, this distribution changes rapidly
as the flow is redirected into the bypass region (vena
contracta). Although there is no recirculation zone ahead
of the first block, the core flow creates two vortex
effects, when it interacts with the porous-covering block
array: recirculations within the interblock cavities, and a
relatively weak recirculation behind the last block. The
height of these recirculations is larger than that of the
solid blocks. Here, the mechanism for the formation of
these complicated flowfield within the channel is the
consolidated result of five effects: 1) a penetrating effect
pertaining to the porous medium, 2) a blowing effect
caused by porous media displacing transversely the fluid
from the porous region into the fluid region (Vafai and
Kim [20]), 3) a suction effect caused by the adverse
pressure gradient behind the porous-covering solid
blocks resulting in a reattached flow, 4) the effects of
boundary-layer separation and reattachment, and 5) the
buoyancy effect induced by heat blocks. It should be
noted that within each interblock cavity, the streamlines
between the recirculation center and the upstream wall of
that cavity are slightly denser than those between the
recirculation center and the downstream wall of the
cavity. This shows that the magnitude of outward
velocity near the upstream cavity wall (CD and GH) is
slightly larger than that of the inward velocity near the
downstream wall (EF and IJ), which may transport more
convective energy from the upstream wall (CD and GH)
than the downstream wall (EF and IJ) of cavity. In
addition, the shape of recirculation zone between two
porous-covering blocks is different from that in flow
over a cavity. In general, flow over an empty cavity
creates a close vortex region (as shown in Fig. 3(d)) and
reduces the heat transfer from heated cavity wall, while
flow over a cavity formed by two porous-covering
blocks produces a recirculating flow, which extends
transversely into the core flow and improves fluid
mixing. This will enhance the transfer of thermal energy
out from the cavity into the core flow. Hence, the
interaction of these recirculations with the core flow
plays a significant role in transferring heat from the
blocks and in determining temperature distribution in
both the fluid and the blocks. Figure 3(c) shows the
isotherms corresponding to the above flow field. The
thermal boundary layer thickness increases over the
porous-covering block array, and decreases downstream
from the block array. Here, the distortion of isotherms
around the block array arises partly due to the periodical
variation in the cross-sectional area of core flow and
partly the periodical displacement of fluid from the
porous region into the fluid region occurring at the left-
side face of each block (BC, FG, and JK). Within each
interblock space, spacing between isotherms is closer in
the upstream end (CD or GH) than in the downstream
end (EF or IJ). This indicates that a higher temperature
gradient in the back face of block (CD or GH) than in the
front face of proceeding block (EF or IJ). The local
Nusselt number distributions around the exposed faces of
the three heat blocks in the array for this case are showed
in Fig. 3(f). For a porous-covering block, along the block
front face (EF or IJ), Nux is small at the right corner (E or
I) and it grows as the reattachment point is approached
due to the recirculation effect. The maximum Nux occurs
at the left corner (F or J) of front face. For the side faces
(BC, FG, or JK), the Nux is largest at the leading corners
(B, F, or J) and then decreases rapidly to a local
8number Da is shown in Fig. 4 for Re=500, Λ=0.35,
Pr=0.7, Grf=2.5105, λeff=1, and *oL =28 with Da=510-
4, 510-5, and 4.410-5, 110-7, and 0, respectively.
The flow fields displayed in Fig. 4(a) reveal that as
Darcy number decreases from 510-4 to 510-5, the
distortion of streamlines and the size of recirculations
behind the blocks become more pronounced. By
decreasing Da up to 4.410-5, the recirculation zone
behind last block disappears, meanwhile a vortex is
formed along the left channel wall downstream the
heated block array. While as Da is decreased further to 0,
an opposite tendency is found. When Da approaches to
zero (the solid block with porous medium could be
regarded as a simple solid block), there are no
streamlines penetrating the porous covers, and the core
flow passes over the solid block array and a closed
vertex is formed within each interblock cavity. This is the
net result of five competing effects of penetrating,
blowing, suction, boundary-layer separation and
reattachment, and buoyancy, as discussed in the previous
section. The variation of Nux distributions around the
surfaces of all three blocks for various Darcy number is
displayed in Fig. 4(b). In the range of 5 10-
4Da4.410-5 for the block back (CD, GH, and KL)
and front (EF, and IJ) faces, Nux increases with
decreasing Da (until an optimal Da or heat transfer rate
is reached) due to the stronger interaction between the
core flow and the recirculation flow, which can convect
more thermal energy away from the block. Along the
side faces (BC, FG, and JK), Nux decreases as Da
decreases. The decreasing tendency of local Nusselt
number distribution at the side surface from a local
maximum value at the leading corner to a local minimum
value near the trailing corner is steeper for smaller Da.
This phenomenon is due to the fact that smaller value of
Da translates into larger blowing effect and weaker
buoyancy effect, which in turn increases the increment of
thermal-boundary-layer thickness and reduce the transfer
of the convective energy. For the first block, Nux
decreases along the front face (AB) as Da decreases
because of the smaller impact of core flow on this face.
For the last block, at Da=4.410-5 the Nusselt number
distribution along the side face is first peaked at the
lower corner (J point), then drops steeply to a minimum,
and finally rises rapidly to a relatively maximum at the
upper corner (K point). This is because the core flow
reattaches on the upper corner (K point) of side face
(JK), which results in decreasing of the thickness of
thermal boundary layer at the rear part of that face. At
the back face (KL), Nux reaches a peak at the right corner
(K point) and then decreases rapidly to a local minimum
value because of the presence of a secondary boundary
layer beginning at leading edge of that surface. As Da
further decreases to 0, the opposite variation occurs for
Nux distributions versus Da. This is due to the weaken
interaction between the core flow and the recirculation
zone, which in turn diminish the convective energy
transport away from the blocks.
The effects of Da on Num over each heated block are
shown in Fig. 4(c). As expected, there exists an optimum
Da for which the heat transfer rate is maximum. Any
increase or decrease in Da will result in the decreases of
Num.

Effect of Reynolds number Re
The effect of variations in the Reynolds number is
depicted in Fig. 6 for Da=510-5,Λ＝0.35, Pr＝0.7, Grf

*
iL =4, and
*
oL =32 with Re=
200, 500, 700, and 1000, respectively. The flowfields
displayed in the Fig. 5(a) portraits that the extent of the
distortion of core flow streamlines and the area of
interblock recirculation zone decrease as the Reynolds
10
noticeable the distortion of the isotherms due to the
increase in the size of the recirculation zones within the
flowfield. Figure 6(b) shows how Nux distribution around
the block surfaces changes with Λ. It can be observed
that, with increasing Λ, heat transfer is enhanced in the
block front (EF and IJ) and back (CD, GH, and KL)
faces due to larger convective heat transfer caused by a
larger recirculation zone, and heat transfer is retarded in
the block side faces (BC, FG, and JK) due to the larger
thermal-boundary-layer thickness caused by the larger
blowing effect. At the range of 0.7<Λ10, the last block
has much larger Nux values along its side (JK) and back
faces (KL) for largerΛdue to larger temperature gradient
caused by the reattachment of the core flow on the upper
corner K. The distribution shape of Nux along these
surfaces of last block without downstream recirculation
has been discussed in previous session (the effect of Da).
For the 1st block, for larger inertial parameters Nux
decreases along its front face (AB) due to a smaller
impact of core flow on that face. Summarily, the overall
block mean Nusselt number Num increases with an
increase in the inertial parameter, as shown in Fig.6(c).
The third block has larger Num value than the second
block asΛ3.

iL =4, and *oL =32. A series of
calculations was carried out by varying the strength of
the mixed convection, Grf/Re
2, in the range of 1.0-8.0,
while the Reynolds number was fixed at Re=200. It can
be seen from Fig. 7(a) that as the ratio Grf/Re
2 increases
from 1.0 to 3.0, the recirculations in the inter-block
region and in the downstream region of the last block
become stronger and tend to move outwards the
interblock cavities. As Grf/Re2 is raised further up to 8.0,
the inter-block and downstream recirculation zones
gradually vanishes by turns from downstream to
upstream of the heated block array. Meanwhile two small
vortices are formed: one is on the left channel wall
downstream the heated block array and the other on the
right channel wall downstream of the former vortex. The
change of this channel flow pattern arises because the
downward flow inside the interblock cavity gradually
changes its direction to become upward flow due to the
upward force of the buoyancy induced by the block back
surfaces (CD, GH, and KL). When the velocity
magnitude of downward flow inside the inter-block
cavity is equal to that of upward flow, a wavy appearance
of flow field near the block array is formed due to the
direct reattachment of core flow on the bottom wall (DE
and HI) of cavities under the action of adverse pressure
gradient behind the block. As expected, the temperature
fields corresponding to different Grashof numbers shows
that at higher Grashof number the extent of distortion for
isotherms increases with the disappearance of
recirculations. This results in a decrease in thermal
boundary layer thickness over the porous-covering block
array. In other words, the temperature gradient near the
heated block surfaces increases due to the cold core flow
reattaching to the bottom plate of the inter-block cavity
(DE and HI).

*
iL =4, and *oL =28. As can be seen, in
Fig. 9(a) that the distortions of streamlines and isotherms
become more pronounced as the height of porous cover
increases. The recirculation zones become larger and
stronger, and finally vanish by turns. Then a second
recirculation is created on the left plate surface
corresponding to reattached region on the right plate and
a third recirculation zone generated on the right plate
downstream of the second recirculation. The reason for
augmenting the recirculation zones is due to the relative
increase in the height of the porous cover, which in turn
offers a higher degree of obstruction to the flow and
grows a larger blowing action in the block side faces
(BC, FG, and JK). The reason for recirculation zone to
pass away is due to the higher adverse pressure gradient
appearing in downstream the porous-covering block
array. The Nux distribution along the exposed surfaces of
the block array, as shown in Fig. 9(b), is similar to that
discussed in the section of the effect of Darcy number or
Grashof number. Figures 9(c) show Num increases with
increasing 
pH due to the larger fluid mixing velocity
caused by bigger recirculation zone and/or larger
temperature gradient caused by the core-flow
reattachment on the block surface.
The effects of increasing the porous-covering block
spacing in the heated block array from 
pS
=0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
and 2.0 are shown in Fig. 10 for Da=510-5, Λ＝0.35,

sW =0.25,

sS =1.0, pW =0.5,
*
iL =4, and *oL =28. The wider
block spacing creates the flatter-and-wider interblock
recirculation, whose center moves to downstream wall of
interblock cavity, as shown in Fig. 11(a). This is because
the larger block spacing allows more fluid into the
interblock cavity,
which, in turn, causes acceleration in the core flow and
lessens the blowing action made by porous medium.
Figure 10(b) show the variation of Nux with geometric
parameter 
pS . As expected, the stronger interblock
recirculation produces higher heat transfer rate from the
block front (EF and IJ) and back (CD, GH, and KL)
faces to the core flow by convection, but reduces at the
block side faces (BC, FG, and JK). As shown in Fig.
10(c), the block overall mean Nusselt numbers Num
decreases with increasing pS from 0.5 to 1.0 owing to
the reducing convection caused by the flatter and weaker
recirculation flows, whereas Num increases with
increasing 
pS from 1.5 to 2.0 owing to the increased
convection aided by higher velocities in the larger-size
recirculation flow.

     所謂聲波冷卻技術(acoustic cooling technology)簡單地說，就是利用
聲波進行制冷，於系統中製造低溫環境的機制，它是一種熱能與聲能互換的現
象。而聲波電子冷卻器(Acoustic cooler)的原理係利用壓電晶片所發出之高頻
率聲波，在一密閉之腔體內週期性地來回壓縮與膨脹腔內之氣體介質，在聲熱
效應作用下，藉氣體介質與外界的熱交換，以近似逆布雷敦的熱力循環
(Brayton cycle)，達成制冷效果。
   Acoustic cooling is a technology which uses sound waves to produce
cooling power. It is a thermal-transform phenomenon between the sound
and thermal energy. Acoustic electronic cooler uses high amplitude
sound, created by piezoelectric driver, to pressurize and expand
periodically the working fluid within a closed resonator. Under the
thermoacoustic effect, the heat is pumped to the surrounding from a
respective area based on the Brayton thermal cycle and achieves the
cooling effect.
