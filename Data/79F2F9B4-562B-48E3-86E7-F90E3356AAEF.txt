（一）中文摘要 
 近年來，無線網狀網路（Wireless Mesh Network; WMN）的應用漸漸普及。它為一種
自我組織（self-organized）與自我設定（self-configured）的動態網路，其網路內的節點會
自動地建立一個無線隨意網路（ad-hoc network）並且維護其網狀的連結性。 
  
在 WMN 中，Mesh backhaul 是一個介於網際網路（Internet）和 WMN 之間的閘道器，
負責將資料從 WMN 內部繞送到網際網路，或從網際網路繞送到 WMN 內每個 Mesh AP 除
了要負責傳送自己涵蓋範圍內的 MS 所要求傳送的資料之外，還必頇負責其他 Mesh AP 所
要求的遞送的資料。再者，無線電傳遞方式是利用廣播的方式，若沒有有效地排程（schedule）
各個 Mesh AP 彼此之間傳送的時間，則 Mesh AP 的傳輸可能會彼此碰撞而導致 WMN 的效
能大幅度的降低。因此，每個 Mesh AP 之間要有一協定互相溝通協調彼此傳送的時間或頻
率，其為無線網路中媒體存取控制（Medium Access Control; MAC）協定。此外，當要傳
送資料給某一 MS 之前，必頇先判斷出該 MS 的 Serving Mesh AP 是哪個 Mesh AP。由於
MS 會移動，造成它可能會聯結到不同的 Serving Mesh AP，所以需要有移動性管理（Mobility 
Management）與繞送（Routing）機制。為了能有效率的使用資源，我們考慮二個重要的議
題（如下所列） 
議題一 有效率的無線網狀網路之無線電資源排程方案:目前 WMN 現有的媒體存取控制
（Media Access Contorl; MAC）協定（即為無線電資源管理）並不 scalable（其表示當
網路中節點變多時，網路效能可能會下降）。因此我們將設計有效率的無線電資源排程
方案以增進無線電資源使用率。 
議題二 有效率的無線網狀網路之移動性管理機制:對於行動使用者之移動性管理目前的
規格皆沒有清楚地規範。我們將提出一個適合於 WMN 的移動性管理協定以及繞送封
包的機制，其可以透過輕量（light-weight）的信令負荷正確地追蹤使用者的位置。 
 
 這個計畫預期在兩年內執行以得到確切的研究成果。我們會先針對目前的 WMN 協定
作仔細的研究。接著根據研究結果，我們設計 WMN 的無線電資源排程方案以及移動性管
理機制。我們將設計理論性的數學分析以及系統模擬實驗來評估我們所提出之機制的效能。
最後，我們會在實際的網路環境中實作我們所提出的機制，進一步的驗證所提機制的可行
性。我們預期針對每階段發表一至數篇國際論文以及專利。對於參與計畫之研究生，他們
能深入了解最新的 WMN 協定，這將有助於國內無線通訊人才培育。除此之外，本計畫研
究成果亦可提供給目前進行無線區域網路研究之學界及業界參考，促使國內無線通訊技術
的快速發展，提升國內無線通訊技術在國際間的競爭力。

相較於 ad-hoc 網路，由 WMN 中的網路節並不具有移動性。這點使得 WMN 具有較低
的信令花費、簡單的網路維護、較可靠的服務範圍等優點。因此，除了被廣泛地應用在高
速的都會區域網路之外，它也可以被應用在寬頻家網路、建築物網路自動化、企業網路等
處。許多公司開始瞭解 WMN 技術的潛力並且開始提供這樣的產品。一些新穎的 WMN 
testbeds 已經在各大專院校的研究實驗室所設計並初步建立。WMN 的技術仍未成熟，許多
規格正在制訂中。舉例來說，目前公認的標準當中，只有 IEEE 802.11 [2]與 IEEE 802.16 [3]
支援 WMN 部份的功能。802.11 是針對 ad hoc 網路來設計的，因此蠻適合使用在 WMN 中，
但是由於 802.11 的無線電範圍較小，加上 contention 的特性（即每一次傳輸之前，所有的
節點必頇與周圍的節點作競爭，以搶到傳送資料的權力），並且它並沒有提供使用者移動性
管理。所以如果我們使用 802.11 當作 WMN 的 MAC 協定，當網路中的節點增加的時候，
其效能會快速地滑落。因此，現有的協定必頇要針對 WMN 重新設計或者是改進。研究學
者已經開始以 WMN 的角度重新設計目前的無線網路協定，IEEE 也針對 WMN 的議題開
始由 IEEE 802.11 Task Group S 制定支援 mesh 的 802.11 協定，稱為 802.11s [4]。在這些目
前的新型協定當中，IEEE 802.16 的協定支援 mesh 模式，成為目前最適合應用於 WMN 的
MAC 層的協定。因此，接下來我們探討一下目前 802.16 協定的詳細內容。 
1.2、無線網狀網路之 MAC 層介紹 
IEEE Standard 802.16-2001 [5] 於 2001 年 10 月完成標準的審核與制定，並在 2002 年 4
月對外正式發表。此規格說明寬頻無線接取技術將成為一項用來連接家庭、企業用戶與電
信核心網路的主要工具。其規定使用的頻帶為 10GHz ~ 66GHz 的高頻頻帶。IEEE 802.16
組織在 2000 年 3 月成立另一項 802.16a 的計畫。此計畫主要規範使用於 2GHz ~ 11GHz 的
頻帶。在 2002 年底完成 IEEE Standard 802.16a [6] 的制定。IEEE 802.16 的內容可以分成
MAC 層（Medium Access Control Layer）與 PHY 層（Physical Layer）兩個部份。在 2004
年，IEEE Standard 802.16-2004 [3]被制訂主要將上述兩種標準整合，並明確制定 MAC 層運
作的兩種模式：單點對多點模式（Point-to-Multipoint Mode；PMP Mode）與網狀模式（Mesh 
Mode）。

中，如何將 256 minislot 有效率地分配給每個 SS，使得 SS 能進行兩種資料 traffic 的傳輸完
全需仰賴一高效率地排程機制。每個 SS 利用排程機制將 256 個 minislot 配置給兩種不同
traffic 的需求。802.16a 提出兩種排程機制: (1) 集中式排程（centralized scheduling）；(2)分
散式排程（distributed scheduling）。集中式排程機制的運作方式如下所述：mesh BS 當作集
中排程器（scheduler），它掌控所有資料 traffic request 的相關資訊（例如，傳輸速率或延遲
等）。透過位在排程器上的排程演算法（scheduling algorithm），mesh BS 將適合的 minislot
給配置給每個 SS。因為對外資料 traffic 在傳送候一定要經由 mesh BS 至外部網路，所以透
過集中式排程來配置 minislot 給對外資料 traffic 是很合適的。在分散式排程機制中，並沒
有所謂的集中排程器，每個節點（包括 mesh BS 與 SS）要求建立連線時，大家會先競爭
（contention）以搶到在 minislot 上傳送資料的權力。相對於集中式排程的方式來說，由於
分散式排程需要花費額外的信令去搶奪無線電資源，因此其效能並不如集中式排程。然而，
分散式排程的即時（realtime）特性使得當每個 SS 有資料要送時，可以馬上與周圍的 SS
開始競爭，因此傳送資料的延遲會比較小。再者，分散式排程發生在任意兩 SS 之間，不
像集中式排程所配置的資料繞送路徑都會經過 mesh BS。基於上述特性，分散式排程適合
配置 minislot 給點對點資料 traffic。如上所述，排程機制與排程演算法是影響 minislot 效能
（utlization）的兩個重要因素。系統若能夠善用兩排程機制，將可使得一個資料子訊框中
的 minislot 可以充分地被配置給需要的 SS，而 WMN 整體的系統項能一定會大幅的提昇。
在下文中，我們將仔細探討由 802.16a 所提出的兩個排程機制的運作模式。 
1.3、集中式排程 
在集中式排程當中，mesh BS 為一集中排程器（scheduler），它掌控所有資料 traffic 
request 的相關資訊（例如，傳輸速率或延遲等）。透過位在排程器上的排程演算法（scheduling 
algorithm），mesh BS 將適合的 minislot 配置給每個 SS。為了讓 mesh BS 能夠得到所有 SS
的 traffic request 相關資訊，WMN 定義了一顆排程樹（scheduling tree），其根（root）為
mesh BS 並連接到每一個 SS。每個 SS 透過排程樹所定義的邊（edge）傳送信令與資料給
mesh BS。為了維護這個排程樹，當每個 SS 加入（join）此 WMN 時，此 SS 會執行註冊程
序並且與mesh BS註冊。在此程序中，SS選擇一個鄰近的 SS為其保證節點（sponsor node）。
此保證節點負責遞送（relay）SS 的註冊信令給 mesh BS。當 mesh BS 收到註冊信令之後，
會將此 SS 加入排程樹中，設定此 SS 為保證節點的孩子（child）節點，給定此 SS 一節點
ID，並將此更新後的排程樹透過 Mesh Centralized Scheduling Configuration（MSH-CSCF）
信令傳送給每個 SS。 
一個有 i 個節點的 WMN 網路可以表示成一張圖（graph），其為：G=(V, E)，其中 V 為
所有節點之 ID 的集合，即 },...,,{

VVVT  。而 E 為所有節點之間存在無線 link 的集合。

的排程演算法與在 SS 上的當地演算法是要經過特別設計且相互對應的。 
步驟 6.

SS 接收到 MSH-CSCH Grant 訊息之後，會將此訊息再傳送給自己的小孩。 
當集中式排程執行完畢之後，每個 SS 可以在下一排程週期中，在被指定的 minislot
傳送或接收資料。透過上述流程可知影響整個排程的效能的重點在步驟 5 的集中式排程演
算法，如何考慮無線網路廣播的特性（即，相鄰的 SS 會互相干擾）設計符合於 WMN 的
排程演算法，是值得討論的議題之一。 
1.4、分散式排程 
在分散式排程機制中，並沒有所謂的集中排程器，每個節點（包括 mesh BS 與 SS）要
求建立連線時，大家會先競爭（contention）以搶到與鄰近 SS 協商的權力。在協商的過程
中，兩SS會討論傳送或接收資料封包的minislot之位置。分散式排程機制的詳細流程如下：
每個 SS 會透過 Distributed Scheduling（MSH-DSCH）訊息將其想要傳送信令的 TO 位置傳
送給它的鄰居以及它鄰居的鄰居。當 SS 收到距離自己兩個 hop 遠內的鄰居所傳送過來的
資訊之後，它會根據這些資訊執行一分散式選舉演算法（distributed election algorithm）選
出一勝利 SS，此 SS 可以在它所要求的 TO 位置與想要建立連線的 SS 之間作三邊協商（three 
way handshake）的動作。我們以圖（三）（a）為例，其中
1V
SS 想要建立一連線至

此連線的傳輸速率為

步驟 0.

SS 先確認自己有足夠的 minislot 可以提供上行與下行的傳輸速率要求，如果其
minislot 足夠，其才會開始將此要求傳輸給

 中央資料庫的移動性管理協定普遍被行動電話網路（cellular network）[13]使用。與其
他網路相比，行動電話網路的服務範圍較大而且具有連續性。在此種移動性管理協定中，
服務範圍被區分為許多區域（location area），並且用一個移動性管理資料庫來記錄所有使
用者所在的區域。當一個使用者從一個區域移動到另一個區域時，會觸發一個註冊程序
（registration procedure），來更新移動性資料庫裡的資訊。而當有電話要打給某個使用者時，
便會從移動性管理資料庫裡查詢（query）這個使用者的所在區域。在這種協定中，特別是
當每個區域的範圍很小時，註冊程序和查詢資料庫可能會耗費許多額外的信令。在 WMN
中，一個區域通常是指一個 mesh AP 的涵蓋範圍，所以 WMN 的每個區域規模並不大。因
此，若直接套用中央資料庫的移動性管理協定到 WMN 中，可能會耗費許多額外的信令成
本，所以並非適當的解決方法。 
在 mobile IP [14]協定中，IP 網路的服務範圍被區分為家網路（home network）與遠端
網路（foreign network）。在家網路中的家代理（Home Agent; HA），以及在遠端網路中的遠
端代理（Foreign Agent; FA），負責將資料經由通道（tunneling）的方式傳送到使用者裝置。
當使用者從家網路移動到遠端網路時，必頇執行註冊程序（registration procedure），用以將
此使用者新的位置資訊告知 HA 與 FA。而當有資料要送給某使用者時，若該使用者位於家
網路中，則資料由 HA 直接繞送至使用者裝置；若該使用者位於遠端網路中，則資料由 HA
經由通道的方式將資料先送到 FA，再由 FA 繞送至使用者裝置。Mobile IP 協定需執行與行
動網路類似的註冊程序，所以也頇耗費額外的信令。另外，由於資料必頇從 HA 先行送至
FA，所以資料的傳送路徑較長（即著名的三角繞送問題）。使得資料傳送的延遲時間拉長。
由於上述的原因，使得 mobile IP 協定不適合套用到 WMN 之中。 
透過上述的討論，我們發現現存的移動性管理機制皆不適宜應用於 WMN 之上。目前
802.16 針對移動性管理的規範也還在制定中，因此 WMN 的移動性管理為值得探討的議題
之一。 
目前針對於無線網狀網路，並沒有現有的規範，我們也是參考行動隨意網路當中所提
出的幾個方案，這些方案有些是全新並且獨立的協定，有些是修改既有的行動隨意網路路
由協定（例如 AODV 等）。而行動隨意網路中的方案是針對上述的攻擊提出對策，此外，
這些方案都會考慮安全性與效能之間的平衡。根據隨意網路當中的作法（參考既有的路由
協定加以改進），在無線網狀網路當中，我們也是基於(1.5)中設計出 WMN 移動性管理的路
由機制加入安全性的考量，針對上述所提及的一攻擊威脅，期望在本議題當中設計出安全
的移動性管理機制。 
1.6、總結 
由上述對 WMN 相關技術的審視，我們對於 WMN 有一大致的瞭解，然而現今的 WMN
相關規格仍存在許多技術議題。我們整理出三個最重要的議題，如下所列： 
議題一 目前 WMN 現有的媒體存取控制（Media Access Contorl; MAC）協定（即為無線
電資源管理）並不 scalable（其表示當網路中節點變多時，網路效能可能會下降）。因
此我們將設計有效率的無線電資源排程方案以增進無線電資源使用率。

2、研究計畫之目的 
藉由背景資料中對於 WMN 相關技術的審視，我們對 WMN 有一大致的瞭解。然而現
今的 WMN 相關規格仍存在許多技術議題值得探討並改進，以下我們提出兩大議題並分別
詳加討論。 
2.1、有效率的無線網狀網路之無線電資源排程方案 
A. 重要性 
在計畫背景中，讀者已知道目前的 WMN 的 MAC 層是使用分時多工的無線電資源技
術。在此技術之中，如何分配 minislot 給每個節點會影響無線電資源使用率。在 802.16a
當中，集中式排程演算法負責處理 minislot 配置。由 [9] 所建議，若我們給定每個 minislot
不同的顏色，則配置 minislot 給某兩個相鄰的 SS 的動作即等於將此兩 SS 之間的無線 link
著色。因此配置 minislot 的問題可以簡化成圖論當中的邊著色問題。然而，當我們在為 WMN
網路當中的無線 link 著色的時候，還需要考慮無線電干擾的問題。因此，此演算法的設計
會相當的複雜，而此為本議題中重要的問題之一。此外，如何整合背景計畫所述的二排程
機制，使得一資料子訊框中的 minislot 可以更有彈性地分配給需要的 SS，進而提昇 WMN
無線電使用率，為本議題中另一重要的問題。 
B. 國內外有關本計畫之研究情況 
12 
 
們無法直接將傳統的邊著色演算法套用到時槽配置之上。我們需要針對無線網路的特性，
重新設計適合於 WMN 的時槽配置演算法。 
此外，802.16a 建議的兩排程機制只能分別對不同資料子訊框中的 minislot 來配置，換
句話說，某個資料子訊框中的所有 minislot 只能用集中式排程或用分散式排程來配置。
802.16a 規格提及可透過一分割（partition）方式，讓兩排程機制配置同一個資料子訊框中
的 minislot，我們稱之為分割方案（Partition Scheme）。圖（七）為分割方案的示意圖。Mesh 
BS 可以透過 Mesh Network Configuration（MSH-NCFG）訊息將集中式排程與分散式排程
在一個資料子訊框可以配置的 minislot 個數比例傳輸給每個 SS，因此此方案不需要耗費額
外的信令。然而，在此方案當中，分割的界線不能準確地反應目前的資料 traffic 型態的比
例，其會導致浪費的 minislot 出現。我們將針對此問題設計一整合方案（Combinded Scheme），
將原本的界線消除，使得兩排程機制可以混合配置一個資料子訊框中的 minislot，則一個
資料子訊框中的 minislot 可以更有彈性地被使用，進而提昇無線電資源的使用率。圖（八）
為整合方案的示意圖。 
C. 重要參考文獻之評述 
透過上述文獻，我們可知 WMN 集中式排程演算法可以利用既有圖論的演算法設計之。
然而，目前這些演算法都是應用在 ad-hoc網路或者是 sensor網路之上。在這兩種網路當中，

(1) Ad-hoc 網路上的移動性管理機制 
Ad-hoc 網路上的移動性管理可以細分為兩小類：主動式與反應式。在主動式的方法中
（例如 DSDV [11]），每個節點會自行維護一個路由表（routing table），此路由表中包含整
個網路的拓樸（topology），以及到任意目的節點的路由路徑。若將此法套用到 WMN 中時，
可將 mesh AP 及 MS 視為同樣的節點，並在這些節點中維護上述的路由表。當有封包要傳
送時，可以藉由查詢路由表來得知目的地所在位置。但是這個方法有個極為嚴重的缺點，
即當網路拓樸有變動時，必頇更新每個節點中的路由表，使得節點間需要交換大量的信令
訊息以互相通知。尤其是當每個 mesh AP 涵蓋範圍很小時（例如：IEEE 802.11），網路拓
樸變動更是頻繁。 
而在反應式的方法中，每個節點並不會在平時就維護一個路由表，而是在當有封包要
傳送時，才臨時尋找一條到達目的節點的最佳路徑。例如 AODV [12]，其尋找目的節點的
過程如圖（九）所示。當節點 X 要傳送封包給節點 Y 時，它先送出 Route Request（RREQ）
訊息廣播給所有鄰居，當其他節點（A、B、C、D、E、及 F）收到此訊息時，它們會再分
送給它們的鄰居，最後此訊息送到 Y 節點（見圖（九）（a）)。Y 節點可藉由 RREQ 訊息
的內容得知收到的 RREQ 訊息通過哪些節點，並且選擇一條最佳的路徑，經由此路徑回傳
Route Reply（RREP）訊息給節點 X（見圖（九）（b）），故 X 可由 RREP 訊息內容得知需
經由 XADY 的路徑傳送封包至節點 Y。此法可直接套用到 WMN 上，但是當有封
包需要傳送時，信令訊息會廣播到網路中的每個節點，因此，當網路節點數量很多時，將
導致信令花費相對增大，並且提高封包傳遞的延遲。 
 總結來說，ad-hoc 上的移動性管理機制假設每個節點都會移動。但是在 WMN 中，構
成網狀骨幹的節點並不會移動。若我們可以利用此特性來設計移動性管理機制，則設計出
的機制將可以避免大量的信令花費及傳送封包的延遲。 
(2) 透過中央資料庫控管使用者移動性的管理機制 
透過中央資料庫控管使用者移動性的管理機制最常應用於現存的行動電話網路 [13]，

C. 重要參考文獻之評述 
透過上述文獻，我們發現現存的移動性管理機制均不適合應用於 WMN 之上。我們預
期 WMN 的移動性管理機制要能充份利用 WMN 的特性，達到低延遲、低信令花費、及最
佳傳送路徑等。表（一）總結參考文獻之移動性管理機制，以及我們預期設計出的機制的
特性。由於目前並沒有適合 WMN 的移動性管理機制，因此我們是第一個針對此議題提出
研究與探討的研究團隊。

英文摘要 
 The IEEE 802.16 standard defines the Mesh mode for Media Access Control (MAC) for 
external and internal packet transmission. In the 802.16 Mesh mode, allocation of minislots is 
handled by the centralized scheduling and distributed scheduling, which exercise independently. 
This part proposes the Combined Distributed and Centralized (CDC) and the Combined 
Distributed and Centralized with Queue capability (CDCQ) schemes to combine the distributed 
scheduling and centralized scheduling so that the minislot allocation can be more flexible, and 
the utilization is increased. Two scheduling algorithms, Round Robin (RR) and Greedy, are used 
as the baseline algorithms for the centralized scheduling. We proposes an analytical model and 
conducts simulation experiments to investigate the performance of the CDC-series schemes with 
the RR and Greedy algorithms in terms of the acceptance rate of both external and internal packet 
data. 
Keywords: IEEE 802.16, Minislot Allocation, Scheduling, Wireless Mesh Network. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The IEEE 802.16 Standard [14] (also known as WiMax) defines air interface, including the 
physical and media access control (MAC) layers, for wireless metropolitan area networks. It 
provides fixed broadband wireless access with the same level of quality of service as the 
traditional cabled access network, e.g., fiber optical links, coaxial links, and digital subscriber 
line links. The data transmission rate is up to 70 Mb/s. An IEEE 802.16 network consists of base 
stations (BSs) and subscriber stations (SSs). The BS serves as a gateway between the IEEE 
802.16 network and the external network. The SS acts like a client-side terminal through which 
mobile users can access the network. The IEEE 802.16 network operates at the 10–66 GHz or the 
2–11 GHz band [14], [22]. In the 10–66 GHz band, the signal propagation between a BS and an 
SS is through line of sight (LOS). The 2–11 GHz band supports non-LOS communication. The 
IEEE 802.16 Standard specifies two modes for sharing the wireless medium: 1) the 
point-to-multipoint (PMP) mode and 2) the mesh mode. The PMP mode is designed for wireless 
communication between the BS and the SSs, and the mesh mode enables communication among 
SSs [14], [9]. In this paper, we concentrate on studying the mesh mode. To simplify our 
description, we refer to the IEEE 802.16 Standard, with the mesh mode as the wireless mesh 
network (WMN).

In [7], it is mentioned that centralized scheduling and distributed scheduling can be executed in 
the same data subframe. 
 
This implies that the data subframe is partitioned into two parts to serve the external and 
internal traffic, respectively, and is known as the ―Partition‖ scheme. However, this may not be 
the best solution, because the partition boundary may not precisely capture the traffic pattern and 
the minislots may not be fully utilized. The two main objectives of this paper are given as 
follows: 
1) developing the Combined Distributed and Centralized (CDC) and Combined Distributed 
and  Centralized with Queue capability (CDCQ) schemes to break the partition 
boundary so that the minislot allocation can be more flexible; 
2) proposing an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to investigate the 
performance for the Partition, CDC, and CDCQ schemes. 
A. Literature Review 
The related literature for the minislot allocation of WMN is summarized as follows: In [26], 
Wei et al. targeted designing a greedy-like algorithm and a routing path establishment algorithm 
for only centralized scheduling. In [16], Kim and Ganz proposed an algorithm based on the 
weights of SSs to fairly allocate minislots for SSs to deliver the external traffic (i.e., for only 
centralized scheduling). In this paper, they investigated the fairness for minislot allocation. In [3], 
Chen et al. considered only centralized scheduling, where they proposed an odd–even alternation 
mechanism for minislot 
allocation. The three papers considered only centralized scheduling. They did not consider the 
interaction of centralized scheduling and distributed scheduling. Furthermore, there is no 
complete performance analysis in these studies. Therefore, the two ideas being investigated in 
this paper are CDC and CDCQ. The study in [2] focused on the design of the centralized 
scheduling algorithm. This is beyond the scope of this paper. In [1], Cao et al. discussed the 
performance evaluation for distributed scheduling. The interaction and combination of the 
distributed scheduling and the centralized scheduling are not considered in [1]. In this paper, we 
consider and provide a more complete performance evaluation for minislot allocation in WMNs.

period (denoted as ts). The minislots of all SSs are re-reserved by centralized scheduling in the 
beginning of every scheduling period. The scheduling result in the ith scheduling period is 
referenced in the i+1st scheduling period as shown in Figure 2.  
In the centralized scheduling, the minislot utilization is highly dependent on the scheduling 
algorithm. To date, some studies [7][6][2] have touched on this issue. It has been shown that the 
scheduling algorithm is a NP-hard problem, that is, we may not find the optimal solution for 
scheduling when the number of SSs in a WMN is sufficiently large. In [2], it has been proven that 
under certain WMN network conditions, the centralized scheduling is no longer a NP-complete 
problem. In this study, we use the two general algorithms, Round Robin (RR) and Greedy, as the 
baseline centralized scheduling algorithms to investigate the performance of the centralized 
scheduling. 
In IEEE 802.16, an operation is defined to partition the minislots in a data subframe for both 
distributed and centralized scheduling (see pp. 86, [14]). In this paper, we refer this operation as 
the Partition scheme whose details are elaborated as follows. 
 
Partition Scheme. 
The minislots in a data subframe are partitioned into two parts, one for the centralized 
scheduling and the other for the distributed scheduling. The centralized scheduling and 
distributed scheduling are executed independently. Each SS maintains a FIFO queue, reqlist, 
to buffer the external packet requests arriving in the SS during the scheduling period. The 
Partition scheme consists of six procedures: Initial, Arrival, Request, Schedule, 
Transmission, and Departure: 
 
Figure 4: The flow chart for the Partition scheme 
Initial:  
This procedure initiates the system parameters. The mesh BS broadcasts all SSs the number 
Mc of minslots in a data subframe that can be allocated for the centralized scheduling. 
Arrival:  
See Figure 4 (a). This procedure is exercised when a new packet request arrives during the 
scheduling period. The SS checks the type of the request (see (1) in Figure 4 (a)). If it is an

CDC Scheme.  
In this scheme, the partition boundary is removed, and both distributed scheduling and 
centralized scheduling can allocate all minislots in a data subframe. We slightly modify the 
procedures of the Partition scheme. Due to the delay of the process for the three-way 
handshake, the transmission for the internal packet request may not be completed within a 
scheduling period. Thus, each SS maintains a FIFO queue, servqueue, to buffer the internal 
packets which are not transmitted completely in a scheduling period. The queued external 
packets can be served in the next scheduling period. If the time period when internal packet 
requests wait in the servqueue is longer than a delay boundδA, these packets are dropped. The 
four procedures are modified as follows. 
 
Figure 6: The flow chart for the CDC scheme 
Arrival:  
The procedure is similar to that of the Partition scheme. For an external packet request, the 
SS buffers this request in the reqlist. For an internal packet request, the SS executes the 
distributed scheduling immediately to reserve minislots for this request. The SS can allocate 
the total minislots to internal packet requests without boundary. 
Request:  
See Figure 6 (a). At the end of the scheduling period, SSai sends the mesh BS the centralized

III. Performance Evaluation 
We conduct simulation experiments to investigate the performance of the Partition, CDC, and 
CDCQ schemes with the RR and Greedy algorithms. Our simulation model is based on the 
event-driven approach, which has been widely adopted to simulate the wireless network 
[18][17][20][19][4]. The notations used in the simulation experiments are listed in Appendix B. 
Our study assumes that all SSs are identical. Following IEEE 802.16 standard (referencing pp. 
788 in [14]), we model the WMN as a regular hexagonal topology as shown in Figure 7, where a 
4-layer WMN is considered. Comparing with the square-grid topology adopted in [23], it is more 
general to adopt hexagonal topology to simulate the WMN.  
 
Note that Every 802.16 transmission includes 2 or 3 OFDM symbols of overhead, which is 
specified in the physical layer (see pp. 427, [14]). Our work focuses on the performance for the 
minislot allocation for both centralized and distributed scheduling (i.e., the MAC layer). The 
detailed performance analysis for the physical layer of OFDM is out of the scope of this paper, 
and has been treated in many previous studies (e.g., [24][11]). Let layer-k SS denote an SS in 
layer k of the scheduling tree. In this topology, a layer-k SS is k hops (where k≥ 1) away from the 
mesh BS. There are 3k SSs in layer k. 
 
We assume that an External packet and an internal packet request mI and mA minislots for 
data transmission, respectively. Let α be the maximum percentage of minislots that can be 
allocated for External packets in a data subframe for the Partition scheme, where 0%≦α≦100%. 
Then Mc = αM . For the CDC-series schemes, all minislots can be allocated for the External 
packets. 
 
We simulate 10,000,000 packet arrivals in each experiment to ensure the confidence interval 
of the 95% confidence level of the output measure is less than 3% of the mean value [15]. Let NI 
and NA be the number of External and internal packet arrivals in an SS, respectively. Let NI
(k)
be 
the total number of External packet arrivals in layer-k SSs, and we have NI
(k)
= 3kNI. Let NI,d
(k)
 
be the total number of dropped External packet arrivals (i.e., the packet arrival cannot be served) 
in layer-k SSs. The dropping probability PI,d
(k)
 for the External packet arrivals in layer-k SSs is 
obtained by 
 
PI,d

=
NI,d

NI
(k)
=
NI,d

We use a K-Dimensional (K-D) Markov process to model the minislot allocation for 
External packet requests for Partition RR and CDC RR. For the purpose of illustration, the 
analytical model for a 4-layer WMN is presented. In the Markov process, a state (w, x, y, z) 
denotes that in the WMN, there are w, x, y, and z External packets being served in layer-1 SSs, 
layer-2 SSs, layer-3 SSs, and layer-4 SSs, respectively. 
 
In the Partition and CDC schemes, to serve an External packet arrival at a layer-k SS, other k－1 
SSs (whose layer numbers are lower than k) will relay the packet to the mesh BS. Each of layer-k
－1, layer-k－2, …, layer-2, and layer-1 SSs requires mI minislots to relay an External packet to 
the mesh BS. With the RR algorithm, each minislot is allocated to at most one SS. For the 
Partition RR and CDC RR schemes, the total number of minislots required to serve an External 
packet arrival at a layer-k SS is kmI . The state space S for the Markov process is

The PI,d Performance for External Packets. Figure 10 plots PI,d as functions of 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
, where K = 4, 
M = 256, mI = mA = 1, and μI=μA. Figures 10 (a) and (b) study the effects of α, whereα= 60% and 
90%. Figures 10 (a) and (c) investigate the effects of scheduling period ts, where ts = μA (short 
scheduling period) and 10μA (long scheduling period). Figures 10 (a) and (d) evaluate the effects 
of queue delay boundary I, where δI = μA (short delay boundary) and δI = 10μA (long delay 
boundary). The general phenomena in Figure 10 are described as follows. The PI,d values 
increase as 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
 increases for all schemes. This is due to that more External packets arrive 
during a period for larger 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
 setup, and they compete for the minislots. All schemes with 
Greedy algorithm outperform that with RR algorithm due to the minislot reuse property. 
Furthermore, CDC-series schemes outperform Partition-series schemes in terms of the PI,d 
performance. In CDC-series schemes, there is no partition boundary. The minislots are allocated 
to the External packets first (i.e., centralized scheduling is executed), and the left minislots are 
allocated to the internal packets (i.e., distributed scheduling is exercised). Therefore, we observe 
that CDC-series schemes gain the better PI,d performance for the External packets. We also 
observe that the queuing mechanism (i.e., the IQ queue) does not improve the PI,d performance. 
To summarize, CDC Greedy (either with or without the IQ queue) has the best PI,d performance 
among the six schemes. 
 
The Base Case.  
In Figure 10 (a) where α = 60%, the PI,d values for Partition Greedy, CDC Greedy, and CDCQ 
Greedy slightly increase and then rapidly increase as 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
 increases. For example, PI,d for 
CDC Greedy slightly increases as ¸
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
≤0.5 and then rapidly increases as 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
> 0.5. The 
minislot allocation for the External packets is exercised at the beginning of the scheduling 
period, and all External packet requests arrive during the current scheduling period are 
buffered before they are processed in the next scheduling period. The External packets are 
34 
 
Effects of ts.  
In Figure 10 (d), the length of the scheduling period (i.e., ts) is ten times of that in Figure 10 
(a). With larger ts, we may have two facts: (i) more External packet requests arrive in a 
scheduling period; (ii) it is more likely that an External packet completes during a 
scheduling period, and the minislots for the External packet may be idle until the next 
scheduling period, which results in poor minislot utilization. The above two facts cause that 
the PI,d performance drops fast for both Partition-series and CDC-series schemes.  
 
Effects of δI.  
In Figure 10 (e), we increase the queue delay boundary δI for CDCQ RR and CDCQ Greedy 
ten times of that in Figure 10 (a). Compare the ―х‖ and ―⊳‖ curves in Figures 10 (a) and (e), 
and we observe that increasing δI does not improve the PI,d performance significantly. This 
phenomenon guides us that it is not worth to provide long delay boundary for the External 
packets. The PA,d Performance for Internal Packets. Figure 11 plots PA,d as functions of 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
, where K = 4, M = 256, mI = mA = 1, and λI =λA. Like Figure 10, Figure 11 shows the 
effects of α, the total traffic, scheduling period ts, and queue delay boundary δA. 
 
The Base Case.  
Consider Figure 11 (a) where α = 60%. In this figure, PA,d values for Partition RR and 
Partition Greedy are zero and are not affected by ¸
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
. For the Partition-series schemes, 
the number of minislots reserved for internal packets is  (1 − 𝛼)𝑀 = 103 and the internal 
traffic load is 
𝜆𝐴
𝜇𝐴
= 9. There are sufficient minislots that can serve internal packets. The PA,d 
values for CDC RR and CDCQ RR approach to zero. This is due to that with the RR 
algorithm, CDC RR and CDCQ RR cannot reutilize the minislots to serve External packets, 
and more minislots can serve internal packets. 
 
36 
 
Effects of α.  
In Figure 11 (b), we increase α to 90%. This figure indicates that α does not affect the PA,d 
performance for CDC RR, CDC Greedy, CDCQ RR, and CDCQ Greedy. With the 
Partition-series schemes, the number of minislots reserved for internal packet arrival is 
 (1 − 𝛼)𝑀 = 26. In this figure, we set λI + λA = 10μA. When 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
= 0.1, the internal traffic 
load is 
𝜆𝐴
𝜇𝐴
= 9 and there are insufficient minislots to serve the new internal packet arrivals. 
Therefore, we observe that when 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
= 0.1, PA,d value for the partition-series scheme is 
high (i.e., 20.3%). As 
𝜆𝐼
𝜆𝐼+𝜆𝐴
 increases, the internal traffic load decreases. Fewer internal 
packet requests arrive in a short period, and thus PA,d values decrease and approach to zero. 
 
Effects of Total Traffic.  
In Figure 11 (c), we increase the total traffic λI + λA to 20μA. We observe similar phenomena 
in Figure 11 (a). 
Effects of ts.  
In Figure 11 (d), the length of the scheduling period is ten times of that in Figure 11 (a). 
With a larger ts setup, more External packet requests arrive in a scheduling period, less 
minislots can be allocated to internal packets, and the PA,d performance for CDC Greedy and 
CDCQ Greedy becomes worse. 
Effects of δA. 
In Figure 11 (e), we increase the queue delay boundary δA for CDCQ RR and CDCQ Greedy 
to be ten times of that in Figure 11 (a). Compare the ―⊳‖ curves in Figures 11 (a) and (e), 
and we observe that increasing δA does not improve the PA,d performance significantly. This 
phenomenon guides us that it is not worth to provide long delay boundary for the internal 
packets. 
 
Effects of the Variations of the Distributions for Packet Input Parameters. 
In the following, we study the effects of the variances for External and internal packet 
inter-arrival/transmission time distributions in the CDCQ Greedy scheme. We set that 
inter-arrival times and transmission times for External (internal) packets have Gamma 
distributions with means 
1

  and 
1

𝑣𝜇 𝐼 =

2  (𝑣𝜇𝐴 >
1
𝛼4𝜇𝐴
2 ) , respectively, where 𝛼1 , 𝛼2 , 𝛼3 , and 𝛼34  > 0 are shape 
parameters. Gamma distributions are considered because they can be used to approximate 
many other distributions [25][18][17][20][19]. Figure 12 plots PI,d and PA,d as functions of

Variance of Internal Packet Transmission Time. From Figures 12 (g) and (h), we have that

IV. Conclusion 
This paper proposed the Combined Distributed and Centralized (CDC) and Combined 
Distributed and Centralized with Queue capability (CDCQ) schemes to combine the distributed 
scheduling and centralized scheduling in the IEEE 802.16 to more flexibly allocate the minislots 
in a data subframe to serve External packets and internal packets in the WMN, while IEEE 
802.16 proposed the Partition scheme for minislot allocation for two kinds of traffic packets. We 
conducted an analytical model and simulation experiments to investigate the performance for the 
Partition, CDC, and CDCQ schemes, where we used the Round Robin (RR) and Greedy 
algorithms as baseline algorithms for the centralized scheduling. Our study indicate that the CDC 
scheme increases External packet acceptance rate, and the queuing mechanism slightly reduces 
the dropping probability for External packet requests.  
 
In terms of internal packet performance, this paper indicated that for the CDC-series schemes 
with Greedy algorithm, the internal packet requests dropping probability is bounded by the ratio 
of the number of SSs around the mesh BS over the total number of SSs in the WMN. Our study 
also indicates that the CDC-series schemes with RR algorithm outperform other schemes. 
 
Finally, we investigated the performance of the variances of External and internal packet 
inter-arrival times and transmission times for the CDCQ scheme. Our study concluded that the 
CDC-series scheme increases the External packet and internal packet acceptance rate in all cases

The MAPs are stationary and connected through the wireless mesh links. Due to MS mobility in 
WMNs, Mobility Management (MM) is required to efficiently and correctly route the packets to 
MSs. We propose an MM mechanism named Wireless mesh Mobility Management (WMM). The 
WMM adopts the location cache approach, where mesh backhaul and MAPs (referred to as mesh 
nodes (MNs)) cache the MS’s location information while routing the data for the MS. The MM is 
exercised when MNs route the packets. We implement the WMM and conduct an analytical 
model and simulation experiments to investigate the performance of WMM. We compare the 
signaling and routing cost between WMM and other existing MM protocols. Our study shows 
that WMM has light signaling overhead and low implementation cost.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) [1] [2] [3] have emerged as one of the major technologies for 
4G high-speed mobile networks. The WMNs provide a ubiquitous solution for wireless Internet 
access and MS-to-MS communication with low deployment cost.  
 
 Fig. 1 illustrates a general WMN architecture that comprises two kinds of fixed mesh nodes 
(MNs). The mesh backhaul is a gateway between the WMN and Internet through which all 
packets are delivered between the WMN and the Internet. The mesh access point (MAP) provides 
network access service to the mobile stations (MSs) through the wireless access links. A wireless 
mesh link exists between two MNs that are located within each other’s radio coverage area. The 
MN location is stationary. 
 
When an MS enters the coverage area of a MAP, the MS performs the association procedure 
to establish a wireless access link to the MAP [2]. This MAP is known as the serving MAP 
(SMAP) of the MS. The wireless link between the MS and the MAP can be a direct link or a 
relay link via other MSs. The coverage area of a MAP can be extended by relaying packets via 
MSs. The relay protocol exercised among MSs is out of the scope of this paper and has been 
studied in several previous studies (for example, [4]). In this paper, we focus on the design of the 
mobility management (MM) protocol exercised in the fixed MNs. Before delivering the user data 
to an MS, the SMAP of this MS must be identified. Then, the user data is sent to this SMAP 
through one or more MNs via the wireless mesh links. These MNs are known as the relaying 
MAPs (RMAPs). Since an MS may change the SMAP from time to time, MM is required for 
packet delivery to the moving MSs. Existing standards (such as IEEE 802.11 [2] and IEEE 
802.16 [3]) for WMNs do not address the MM issue. The MM consists of location management 
and handoff management. Location management maintains the location of the current SMAP for 
an MS. When an MS changes its SMAP, location management updates the SMAP information 
for the MS. During data transmission, if the MS changes from old SMAP to new SMAP, handoff 
management enables the old SMAP to forward user data to the new SMAP.

data for the MS. The MS’s location information is distributed in the MNs that have routed the 
packets for the MS. The MM is exercised when MNs route the packets. 
We have implemented the WMM mechanism. In our implementation, we set up a WMN 
with four MAPs and a mesh backhaul. Each MAP is emulated by a laptop computer (running the 
Linux operating system) with two 802.11b WLAN cards. Our implementation is based on the 
Linux-2.6 OS [8] patched with the ipdivert package [9] that provides divert socket functionality 
for programmers to manipulate IP packets. Due to page limitation, the implementation is 
described in a separate report, http://pcs.csie.ntu.edu.tw/wmm/. Our implementation is a 
prototype of which the major objective is to verify the functionalities of the WMM mechanism. 
Currently, the WMN is not widely deployed, and there is no test bed for the WMN either. The 
deployment of WMN will cost very much. Once the test bed is available, we will deploy the 
WMM mechanism in the real system, which will be considered in our future work. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the WMM mechanism. 
Section 3 proposes an analytical model and simulation experiments to study the performance of 
WMM. Section 4 compares the signaling and routing cost of WMM and other existing MM 
protocols. Section 5 concludes this paper. 
 
II. THE WMM MECHANISM 
In the WMM mechanism, MNs are assigned fixed IP addresses. The IP addresses assigned 
for MSs can be done manually or by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [10]. The 
WMM mechanism does not require MSs to change their IP addresses for MM. An MN maintains 
two cache tables, the routing table and the proxy table. The routing table is used to maintain the 
routing paths between the MN and other MNs. The proxy table maintains the MS location 
information. In WMM, when an MS enters a WMN or moves from one SMAP to another MAP, 
the MS registers to the new SMAP. The MS location information is carried in the packet headers. 
When MNs route packets for an MS, the location information of the MS in proxy tables in the 
MNs are updated. Then, the MN can correctly route the packets for MSs by referencing the proxy 
table and routing table. If the mesh backhaul does not cache MS location information when 
processing packet routing, a query procedure is executed to obtain the MS location information.  
 
Several routing table maintenance protocols have been proposed in the Internet or ad hoc 
networks [30]. These protocols can be applied in WMM directly. In this paper, we focus on the 
proxy table maintenance for the MNs.

As shown in Figure 2, every MN maintains an entry in the proxy table for MS, which consists of 
three fields: the Im field (to store MS’s IP address), the Is field (to store the IP address of MS’s 
SMAP), and the Ts field (to store the time when the MS is associated with its SMAP, also known

 After Step RE3, MS1’s location information is kept in the proxy tables of both MAP1 and 
MAP2, and the location management for MS1 is done at MAP1 and MAP2. For other MNs with 
obsolete MS1’s location information (that is, Is field for MS1 stores MAP1’s IP address), the 
packets are first routed to MAP1, and then MAP1 retrieves its proxy table to forward the packets 
to MAP2. Note that there is no possibility of any loop that resulted from the registration 
procedure. Suppose that MS1 has the movement, MAP1, MAP2; . . . ;MAPn;MAP1. When MS1 
moves from MAPn to MAP1, the registration procedure is exercised between MS1 and MAP1, 
which updates MAP1’s proxy table. Since MAP1 is the SMAP of MS1, all packets can be routed 
to MS1 directly through MAP1. Hence, the loop problem does not exist in the WMM mechanism. 
 
2.2. The Routing Procedure 
The routing procedure is executed by MNs when the MNs route the packets for an MS, which 
consists of two parts: Location Information Synchronization and Packet Routing. 
 
Part 1: Location Information Synchronization. In this part, the MS location information in 
the proxy table of the MN and that carried in the IP header of the packets are updated as the latest 
MS location information. Suppose that MS1 (sender) is sending IP packets to MS2 (receiver), 
where MAP3 is one of the MNs along the routing path. Steps L1 and L2 update the location 
information for the sender (that is, MS1). 
 
Step L1. Upon receipt of an IP packet, MAP3 first checks the prefix of MS1’s IP address to 
determine whether MS1 is in the WMN. If the packet is sent from Internet into the WMN 
(that is, MS1 is out of the WMN), MAP3 does not need to maintain MS1’s location 
information, and the procedure jumps to Step L3. Otherwise, the procedure proceeds to the 
next step. 
 
Step L2. MAP3 checks the options field in the IP header. Two cases are considered. 
Case L2.I. The options field is null, that is, MAP3 is MS1’s SMAP, whose proxy table 
contains MS1’s current location information. MAP3 updates the options field in the IP 
header: ISS is set to the Is value of MS1’s entry in MAP3’s proxy table; SST is set to 
the Ts value of MS1’s entry in MAP3’s proxy table; IRS is set to null; RST is set to the 
48 
 
Case R1. MS2 is not in the WMN. If MAP3 is the mesh backhaul, it simply routes the packet to 
the Internet. Otherwise (that is, MAP3 is not the mesh backhaul), it routes the packet to the 
next hop (that is close to the mesh backhaul) by referencing the routing table.  
Case R2. MS2 is in the WMN, and the IRS field in the IP header is null (that is, MS2’s SMAP is 
unknown). If MAP3 is the mesh backhaul, it exercises the query procedure (to be elaborated 
in the next subsection) to obtain the IP address of MS2’s SMAP and then routes the packet 
to the next hop that is close to MS2’s SMAP. Otherwise (that is, MAP3 is not the mesh 
backhaul), MAP3 routes the packet to the next hop that is close to the mesh backhaul by 
referencing the routing table. 
Case R3. MS2 is in the WMN, and the IRS field in the IP header specifies MAP3’s IP address 
(that is, MAP3 is MS2’s SMAP). The packet is directly delivered to MS2.  
Case R4. MS2 is in the WMN, and the IRS field in the IP header contains the value other than 
MAP3’s IP address. MAP3 references the routing table to route the packet to the next hop 
that is close to the MAP specified by the IRS field. 
 
2.3. The Query Procedure 
The query procedure is exercised by the mesh backhaul toobtain the IP address of receiver’s 
SMAP when the mesh backhaul routes a packet for the receiver, and the receiver’s SMAP is 
unknown (see Case R2 in the routing procedure). Suppose that MS2 is the receiver of the packet. 
The query procedure consists of the following three steps. 
 
Step Q1. The mesh backhaul broadcasts a route request message, RREQ(MS2’s IP Address), to 
all MAPs. The mesh backhaul starts a timer Tq and then expects to receive a route response 
message, RRES, before the timer expires. 
Step Q2. Upon receipt of the RREQ message, MS2’s SMAP replies a route response message, 
RRES(IP Address of MS2’s SMAP, MS2’s Serving time stamp), to the mesh backhaul. 
Step Q3. If the RRES message is received before Tq expires, the mesh backhaul updates MS2’s 
location information carried in the IP header and that in the proxy table. After query 
procedure, MAP3 can route the packet. Otherwise (that is, Tq expires), the mesh backhaul 
discards the packet. 
 
Note that the query procedure requires flooding signaling messages to all MNs in the WMN, 
which is a high-cost operation. 
 
III. AN ANALYTICAL MODEL FOR QUERY OVERHEAD 
As described in Section 2.2, when the mesh backhaul routes the packet whose receiver’s 
location information (that is, the IP address of the receiver’s SMAP) cannot be determined, it 
exercises the query procedure to obtain the information (see Case R2). The query procedure 
requires flooding signaling messages to the WMN, which results in signaling overhead. This 
section proposes an analytical model and simulation experiments to study this performance issue. 
We classify the traffic in a WMN into two categories: Internet and intranet sessions. The Internet

1,000, and vz = 1/ω
2
 (that is, exponential MAP residence time). As η increases, other 
MSs initiate their first intranet session to MS0 earlier (that is, 1/η, is smaller). It is more 
likely that an MS initiates an intranet session to MS0 before MS0 initiates the first 
Internet session, and the mesh backhaul may not contain MS0’s location information 
when it routes the intranet session for MS0. Therefore, we observe the larger Pq values 
when η increases. 
 Effects of γ. Fig. 6 also studies the effects of γ, where γ is set to 1 percent, 5 percent, 
and 10 percent. The figure shows that, with lager γ, the Pq performance for WMM 
drops. When γ increases, there are more MSs that initiate an intranet session toward 
MS0. It is more likely that an MS initiates an intranet session to MS0 before MS0 
initiates the first Internet session. The mesh backhaul has a worse chance to contain 
MS0’s location information when it routes the intranet session for MS0. 
 Effects of ω. Fig. 7 studies the effects of ω, where η = 0.001λ, vz = 1/ω
2
 (that is, 
exponential MAP residence time), and N = 1, 000. As ω increases, the Pq values 
slightly drop. With the higher MS mobility, through the registration procedure, the 
MS’s location information is more likely to be cached in the MAPs, which reduces the 
possibility to invoke the query procedure. Therefore, we observe that Pq decreases as ω 
increases. 
 Effects of vz. Fig. 8 studies the effects of vz, where η = 0.001λ, ω = 0.1λ, and N = 1,000. 
The figure shows that, with lager vz, the Pq values drop. This is due to the fact that, as 
vz becomes large, more small z values are observed. Therefore, the higher MS mobility 
is expected. Similar to the effects of ω(see Fig. 7), the MS’s location information is 
more likely to be cached in the MAPs. We observe that WMM functions better (that is, 
smaller Pq is observed) as vz increases. 
54 
 
4.1. Signaling and Routing Cost for WMM 
In WMM, when an MS changes its SMAP, location update is done through the registration 
procedure and the routing procedure. The registration procedure is executed among an MS, the 
MS’s current SMAP, and the MS’s pervious SMAP. We consider three situations: 
 
S1. The MS enters the WMN and then is powered on. The MS only communicates with its 
SMAP. There are two nodes involved in signaling message  exchange for the 
registration procedure. The cost for the registration is 2. 
S2. The MS is powered on and moves from the old SMAP to the new SMAP. There are 
three nodes involved in the signaling message exchange for the registration procedure. 
The cost for the registration is 3. 
S3. The MS is switched off at SMAP1 and then powered on at SMAP2. This is taken as a 
new registration to SMAP2. There are two nodes involved in the signaling message 
exchange of the registration procedure. The cost for the registration is 2. 
 
 Based on the above discussion, the cost for the signaling message exchange of the 
registration procedure is less than or equal to 3. The routing procedure is done by an MN while it 
routes a packet for the MS. No signaling messages are required for the routing procedure. Thus, 
we have Cu ≥ 3 for WMM.  
 
When a session is initiated toward an MS, location tracking is processed through the routing 
procedure and the query procedure. As described above, the routing procedure does not incur 
signaling cost. On the other hand, the query procedure requires flooding signaling messages to all 
MNs. The number of nodes involved in the query procedure equals the total number of MNs (that 
is, M). However, the query procedure may not be invoked for the MS during the time when the 
MS stays in the WMN. Actually, the query procedure is executed with probability Pq for an MS 
(see Section 3), and it is invoked at most once for the MS. Let r (r > 0)  be the number of 
sessions initiated toward an MS during the time when the MS stays in the WMN. Consequently, 
Ct for WMM can be estimated as 
𝑀∙𝑃𝑞
𝑟
 .   
Suppose that MS1 Suppose that MS1 is sending packets to MS2, where MAP1 and MAP2 are 
SMAPs of MS1 and MS2, respectively. Let MAP’2 be MS2’s previous SMAP. Three cases are 
considered to count Cr for WMM: 
 
Case 1. MAP1’s proxy table contains MS2’s current location information. The packets can 
be routed directly to MS2, and Cr is R . 
Case 2. MAP1’s proxy table contains obsolete MS2’s location information. The packets are 
first routed to MAP’2 and then MAP’2 routes the packets to MAP2 through other MAPs, 
where the routing path between MAP’2 and MAP2 may be a direct link or polygon links. 
Let 𝑟 1 be the average number of MNs along the routing path between MAP1 and 
MAP’2, and 𝑟 2 be the average number of MNs along the routing path between MAP’2 
56 
 
flooding signaling messages to the WMN, and the location tracking is done at the same time. 
Some reactive approaches for ad hoc routing protocols (for example, Ad hoc On-demand 
Distance Vector (AODV) [4]) can cache the old route until the old route breaks. Let ns be the 
average number of sessions between any two MSs, MS0 and MS1, within a time period where 
MS0 and MS1 do not change their SMAP. To initiate the first session, MS0 or MS1 floods 
signaling messages to the WMN and obtains a routing path between MS0 and MS1. Since the 
total number of nodes in the WMN is M + N, the Ct cost for the first session is M t N. For the 
others of the ns sessions, since MS0 (or MS1) has cached the routing information after the first 
session, there is no need to flood any signaling messages for the establishment of other sessions. 
The average signaling cost for one session can be estimated as Ct = 
𝑀+𝑁
ns
 . Typically, when the 
mobility of MSs is high, the number ns is a small number. 
 
To summarize, the proactive approach introduces extra signaling overhead for routing table 
maintenance especially when MS mobility is high. The reactive approach not only introduces 
extra signaling overhead but also spends time to establish the route before user data is delivered, 
which significantly delays user data transmission. 
 
4.3 Signaling and Routing Cost of the Centralized-Database MM Protocol 
In the centralized-database MM protocol, a centralized MM database is maintained to store the 
location information for all MSs. Whenever an MS moves from one LA to another, a registration 
procedure is triggered for location update. The registration procedure is executed between the MS 
and the database to update the LA ID stored in the database. Thus, we have Cu = R  for the 
centralized-database MM protocol. 
 
When an MS has packets to be sent to the destination MS, it queries the database for the 
destination MS’s location information, where the signaling messages for location tracking are 
exchanged between the MS and the database. Thus, we have Ct = R  for the centralized-database 
MM protocol. 
 
In the centralized-database MM protocol, the destination MS’s current location information 
is stored in the centralized database. The packets can be routed correctly to the destination MS. 
We have Cr = R  for the centralized database MM protocol. 
 
4.4 Signaling and Routing Cost of Mobile IP Protocol 
In the mobile IP protocol, the HA in the home network and the FA in the foreign network are 
responsible to tunnel packets for MSs. When an MS moves from the home network to the foreign 
network, a registration procedure is triggered for location update, which is executed between the 
MS, the FA, and the HA to inform the FA and HA of the MS’s movement. Typically, the MS is 
close to the FA, and we can omit the signaling and routing cost between the MS and the FA. 
Thus, we have Cu = R  for the mobile IP protocol. 
58 
 
TABLE 1 Comparison between WMM and Other MM Mechanisms 
 
 
The Cr cost for WMM is obviously lower than that for the base mobile IP protocol whose Cr 
cost is estimated as 2𝑅. The Cr cost for WMM approaches that for the proactive ad hoc routing 
protocol, the reactive ad hoc protocol, the centralized-database MM protocol, and the mobile IP 
with route optimization. However, as mentioned above, the ad hoc routing protocols, the 
centralized-database protocol, and the mobile IP with route optimization incurs much heavier 
signaling overhead (that is, Cu and Ct cost) than WMM does. To summarize, the proposed 
WMM mechanism is capable of correctly and efficiently routing packets for MSs with lighter 
overhead than the existing MM protocols do. 
 
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
This paper designed a novel MM protocol, the WMM mechanism, for WMNs by capturing 
the characteristics of WMNs. In the WMM mechanism, location caches to cache MSs’ location 
information are added in the MAPs so that the network can more efficiently (that is, fast and low 
signaling cost) route packets to mobile users. The fields in the IP header are utilized to carry MSs’ 
location information. Location update can be done at the same time when the MN routes packets 
for MSs and the signaling cost for location update is reduced. The MSs’ location information is 
distributed within the WMN. We have implemented a prototype of the WMM mechanism in the 
real system.  
 
If the MS’s location information cannot be determined, the query procedure is executed to 
find the MS’s location, where signaling cost may incur to the network. We conducted an 
analytical model and simulation experiments to study this performance issue. Our study shows 
the following: 
 
 When an MS enters the WMN, if the first intranet session is initiated toward the MS earlier, 
the Pq is higher. On the other hand, if the MS initiates its first Internet session earlier, the Pq 
is lower.  
 With higher MS mobility or higher variance of the MAP residence time, the WMM gains 
better Pq performance (that is, Pq is lower). 
 
 At the end of the paper, we made a comparison between WMM and other existing MM
