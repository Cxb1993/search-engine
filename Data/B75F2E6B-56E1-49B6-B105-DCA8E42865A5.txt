1. ABSTRACT
The equipment of the middle pressure oxygen
cabin in health care helps for human to get more
oxygen. The factors of air pollution due to
industrial development, deforestation due to
growth of population and habitat, unclean blood
vessel, the stressfulness of life and lack of
exercise lead to the plight of lack of oxygen. The
lack of oxygen is proven to be a reason of ageing
and diseases. It leads to the negative change of
physiology and psychology in daily life, or leads
to death when the state becomes more serious. So
what the people’s need is not only oxygen but 
enough oxygen.
Hyperbaric oxygen cabin is used for medical
treatment in all hospitals now. Because an ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of cure, the health
care in the daily life is necessary. The pressure
and oxygen concentration in the middle pressure
oxygen cabin in health care are lower than in the
hyperbaric oxygen cabin for medical treatment.
It is used to health, cosmetology and health care,
people can take easy access to health at home.
This study included two parts. The first part
will develop and assemble one hyperbaric oxygen
cabin made by ourselves. The second part will
make comparisons between the physiological
states in use of the middle pressure oxygen cabin
and in the unused condition monitored by a
physiological signal system to evaluate the
efficiency.
Keywords—oxygen cabin, health care,
physiological signal
2. INTODUCTION
The ways human body gains oxygen are many,
besides the combination oxygen, which is the
combination of oxygen and hemoglobin, will be
delivered to every cell of the body, there is still
another way called dissolved oxygen, which means
that the oxygen will dissolve in blood and body
fluids. The molecules of dissolved oxygen are
smaller than those of combination oxygen; they can
easily go through the capillaries to deliver the
oxygen to every histiocyte in the body more
efficiently. The function of the middle pressure
oxygen cabin in health care is to help the body gain
more dissolved oxygen, and to prevent people from
aging and recovery from fatigue [1].
The oxygen concentration on the earth changes
according to time and places. As the research
indicates, by the chemical analyses that were
conducted on the bubbles contained by ambers of
prehistoric era [2], the average oxygen content in
the atmosphere was about 30%~35% during that
period. Some research even points out the
atmospheric oxygen content not only changes with
season but gets little year by year [3]. Consequently,
oxygen depletions are expected for densely
populated cities in the world [4]. Among them, the
oxygen content rate is only 15% in the worst
situation. When the quantity of oxygen becomes
lower than 18%, hypoxia occurs. Moreover, as long
as the modern society becomes more convenient,
the activity amount in human being’s daily life 
becomes less. The lack of exercising leads to
weakness of cardiopulmonary function and those
organs can absorb less oxygen. As well as the bad
habits of diet, daily lives, various factors that bring
about spiritual stress, result in the state of oxygen
deficiency. It is the main cause of cancers, heart
trouble and any other disease that damage human
health [5].
The portable hyperbaric chamber applies its
principle as the fundamental to develop the health
care device. In 1919, H, Seltzner designed the first
transportable hyperbaric chamber for
decompression sickness [6]. In 1970, Norman et al
introduced a mobile hyperbaric oxygen vehicle for
the treatment of CO poisoning [7]. However, these
devices still had a heavy, rigid body that required a
relatively large amount of storage space. In 1990,
Gamow et al [8] devised a new portable hyperbaric
chamber called the "Gamow Bag". However, the
original Gamow bag is too labile to withstand the
higher pressures.
B. Multichannel miniature wireless apparatus for
recording physiological signals of human
1) Electrocardiography(ECG): The standard
electrode pads are stuck on where under the left
nipple away from handbreadth to take
electrocardiography. Heart rate variability is an
important method to evaluate the autonomic
nervous system; the part of high frequency is the
activity of parasympathetic nerve, the part of the
low frequency is the activity of the sympathetic
nerve, can determine the excitement of human.
Figure 2. The flow chart of the control system
2) Electroencephalography(EEG): According to
the 10-20 system, the standard electrode pads are
stuck on the C3. To calculate the potential
difference caused by the action of cortical neurons,
recording the Electroencephalography signals to
beta, alpha, theta, delta and converted into MPF
which is the activity of brain to determine the state
of brain.
3) Electromyography (EMG): The standard
electrode pads are stuck on two sides of chin and
bone to take electromyography. Muscle is
composed of the contractile stimulated by moter and
plates, recording the potential difference caused by
moter and plates to determine the activity of muscle.
4) Electrooculography(EOG): The standard
electrode pads are stuck on the upper side of right
canthus away from 1-2 cm and the lower side of left
canthus away from 1-2 cm to take
electrooculography. The potential difference
between cornea (positive potential) and omentum
(negative potential) caused by the movement of
eyeballs can be recorded by the standard electrode
pads stuck on the left and right eyes to observe the
movement of eyes.

5. CONCLUSION
This research proves that we can find the
concentration changes of oxygen by an equation.
That can not only save an oxygen sensor but also set
the time limit to control the solenoid valves to get
the concentration that we want.
Recording physiological signals between the
cabin-used or no, we find that the ECG and EEG
will change significantly; the body and the brain
will become relax and stable. It can provide people
with a pressure-released environment nowadays.
Because the cabin made of steel, the strength
and durability is better than Gamow bag, and
provide another choice of portable oxygen cabin.
And use lower pressure and oxygen concentration to
avoid the oxygen toxicity, transient vision loss and
other symptoms. The oxygen-cure and
oxygen-healthy keeping are the production of the
civil society. Without the accumulation of many
kinds of medical science and chemistry, the
oxygen-cure and oxygen-healthy keeping are by no
means to be existing. It had already been
emphasized in the science all over the world. With
the deep of knowledge, the oxygen-healthy keeping
and oxygen-cure will be extensively used in the
aspect of prevention-medical, clinical- medical,
career-harm- medical, sports- medical, women and
child- medical, older- medical. The oxygen-healthy
keeping and oxygen-cure will be combining with
the metabolism to enhance the ability of inhale,
transport and using oxygen and it can be dedicated
to the aspect of the potential of body power,
intelligence, heart and society.
