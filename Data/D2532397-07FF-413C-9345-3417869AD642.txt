Abstract 
In this paper, the GPS tracking loop design problem is investigated by using a behavioral approach. The 
concept of behavioral framework was first proposed by Jan C. Willems in a series of papers (J.C. Willems, 
"From time series to linear system - part I, II, and III," Automatica Vol. 22, 1986.) as a generic tool for 
mathematical modeling of dynamical systems. In the last decade, the behavioral point of view has received 
an increasingly broader acceptance as an approach for modeling dynamic systems, and now it is generally 
viewed as a cogent framework for system analysis. One of the reasons for its success has to be looked for in 
the fact that it does not start with the input/output point of view for describing how a system interacts with its 
environment, but focuses on the set of system trajectories, the behavior, and hence on the mathematical 
model describing the relations among all system variables. In the proposed approach, the dynamical model of 
the GPS receiver tracking loop (carrier loop and code loop) is firstly described by a kernel representation. We 
will then show that the loop filter design can be cast in a global total lease-squares problem, which can be 
solved by a structured total least-squares (STLS) algorithm. STLS algorithm is a modified version of the 
traditional total least-squares (TLS) method. It can be shown that the STLS algorithm is able to provide 
better performance than the TLS algorithm for the problems that possess a particular structure. In the case of 
the present paper, it is shown that the tracking loop filter design problem has a Hankel structure, therefore the 
problem can be solved by an STLS algorithm subject to a Hankel structure.

legitimate functions, according to the system , 
from the universum set U = . The behavior can 
be described in many ways, while in the context of 
dynamical systems, the most often used are 
represented by the mapping : gf   , i.e., 
 | ( ) 0  B w f w . 
The equations f(w) = 0 are called annihilating 
behavioral equations. A dynamical system Σ = (, 
, B) is linear when the signal space  is a 
vector space and B is a linear subspace of  
(viewed as a vector space in the natural way). In 
this paper, we restrict ourselves to the case when 
the time axis is either  =  or  = , namely the 
discrete-time case. A system Σ = (, , B) is 
time-invariant if B B,  where σ is the 
backward shift operator (σw) := w(t+1) and 
: { | }w w  B B . In the case  = , a system Σ 
= (, , B) is time-invariant if B = σB. 
Time-invariance requires that if a time series w is 
a trajectory of a time-invariant system, then all its 
backward shifts σtw, t > 0, are also trajectories of 
that system. The restriction of the behavior 
( )  B w  to the time interval [t1, t2], where 
1 2,t t   and t1 < t2, is denoted by

          ;w B  
i.e., by looking at the time series w through a 
window of finite width t1-t0, one can decide if it is 
in the behavior or not. The class of all complete 
LTI systems with w variables is denoted by w. 
 
The class of dynamical systems that are studied 
in this paper consists of those that can be 
described by the following type of behavioral 
difference equation: 
 
 0 1( ) ( 1) ( ) 0,lR w t R w t R w t l      
 (1) 
 
where 1 1, ,..., glR R R  w . Equation (1) shows the 
dependence between successive samples of the 
time series w. Without loss of generality, we can 
assume that 0lR   so that the equation has the 
maximum number of shifts l, which is also called 
the lag of the difference equation. Usually, 
Equation (1) will be much more analyzed by using 
the polynomial matrix representation. Define 
 
 20 1 2( ) : [ ]l glR z R R z R z R z z      w , 
 
then Equation (1) can be compactly written as  
 
 R(σ)w = 0.      
   (2) 
 
Equation (2) (or equivalently, Equation (1)) is 
usually called a kernel representation in the 
behavioral context. A kernel representation (2) for 
a given B is not unique. If the polynomial matrix 
R(z) defines a kernel representation of B, then for 
any unimodular matrix [ ]p pU z , U(z)R(z) also 
defines a kernel representation of B. The kernel 
representation is called minimal if R is full row 
rank. There exists a minimal one, called shortest 
lag representation, in which the number of 
equations p = rowdim(R), the maximum lag l, and 
the total lag

where li is the lag of the ith equation, are all 
minimal. A kernel representation R(σ)w = 0 is a 
shortest lag representation if and only if R(z) is 
row proper. Let li be the degree of the ith row of R. 
The polynomial matrix R is called row proper if 
the leading row coefficient matrix, i.e., the matrix 
of which the (i, j)th entry is the coefficient of the 
term with power li of Rij(z), is full row rank. 
 
In a shortest lag representation the number of 
equations is equal to the number of outputs in an 
input/output representation and the total lag is 
equal to the state dimension in a minimal 
state-space representation. These numbers are 
invariants of the system. The maximal lag of B, 
denoted by l(B), is called the lag of the system, 
and its total lag, denoted by n(B), is called the 
order of the system. 
 
The behavior (or the system) induced by Equation 
(1) can be defined as:

3. Simulation Results 
In order to produce a H∞ suboptimal loop filter, 
the variance of the post correlation noise n and the 
magnitude of the noise gain in the dynamics 
model must be known. Let’s first consider the post 
correlation noise n. For our example design, 
assume that the signal power is W, and that the 
jamming to signal power ratio (J/S) is 40 dB. At 
this power levels, the empirical output of the 
detector is as shown in Figure 1. The parameters 
used in this simulation are given in Table 1. The 
simulation was run for 30 seconds in order to 
generate each point in the plot. The solid curve 
represents the analytically derived detector output, 
).2/()2/( 22 cccc TeRTeR +−−  The dashed line that 
closely follows the solid line is the mean of the 
detector output. The dashed lines that are above 
and below the mean represent the empirically 
obtained standard deviation of the simulated 
detector output. 
 
 The effective post correlation noise standard 
deviation σν is a function of the tracking error e. 
This phenomenon is due to the signal power 
estimation method. For code phase estimation 
errors less than 0.5 code chips, the standard 
deviation is approximately equal to 0.1. Therefore 
σν will be set to 0.1 in the H∞ designs. 
 
 For the code phase dynamics, usually it is 
strongly dependent on the receiver platform 
characteristics, the mission, and whether or not 
IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is available, etc. 
For our simulation, we simply choose g(t) = 10 
m/s2. Observe that the A-matrix of the generalized 
plant is not stable because it has eigenvalues lying 
on the unit circle. If the system is not stabilisable, 
it is generally not possible to find an internally 
stabilizing controller for the unstable generalized 
plant. To circumvent this difficulty, we shall 
slightly perturb the A-matrix into the following 
form:

A BEHAVIORAL FRAMEWORK FOR WIDE-AREA DIFFERENTIAL GNSS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
In this paper, we present a behavioral approach to solve 
wide-area Differential GNSS positioning problems as 
well as a way to represent the DOP (dilution of precision) 
of a moving object. The concept of behavioral modeling 
was first proposed by Jan C. Willems in a series of papers 
(J.C. Willems, "From time series to linear system - part I, 
II, and III," Automatica Vol. 22, 1986.) as a generic tool 
for mathematical modeling of dynamical systems. In the 
proposed approach, a GNSS positioning problem is firstly 
described by a kernel representation and then the problem 
can be solved by a structured total least-squares (STLS) 
algorithm. STLS algorithm is a modified version of the 
traditional total least-squares (TLS) method. It can be 
shown that the STLS algorithm is able to provide better 
performance than the TLS algorithm for the problems that 
possess a particu-lar structure. In the case of the present 
paper, it is shown that the GNSS positioning problem has 
a Hankel structure (i.e., the geometric matrix of the pseu-
dorange equation is Hankel), therefore the problem can be 
solved by an STLS algorithm subject to a Hankel struc-
ture.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Traditionally, in a GPS receiver, the technique of least-
squares optimization is utilized to find a position fix. In 
this approach, a nonlinear range relationship between the 
satellites and the receiver has to be obtained at first, and 
then this nonlinear relationship is linearized around a 
neighborhood of the equilibrium point to obtain a set of 
linear pseudorange measurements equations. The method 
of least-squares estimation can then be applied to the li-
nearized pesudorange equations to acquire an optimal 
solution in the sense that the error covariance between the 
true position and the estimated position is minimized. 
Specifically, consider for example a linear static model 
represented by an over-determined system of equations 
Ax B , where A, B are given measurements, and the 
classical least-squares (LS) method, which minimizes the 
Frobenius norm of the residual E:=Ax-B. The residual E 
in the LS problem formulation can be viewed as an unob-
served, latent variable that allows us to resolve the data-
model mismatch. An approximate model for the data is 
obtained by minimizing some norm (e.g., the Frobenius 
norm) of E. This cost function is called latency, and equa-
tion error based methods are called latency oriented. 
An alternative approach, called misfit, common-
ly seen in the literature is to find the smallest correction 
on the data that makes the corrected data compatible with 
the model. Then a norm of the lack of fit between the data 
and the model can be taken to be a quantitative measure, 
namely the misfit, of the correction. Applied the above-
mentioned concept again to the linear static model, 
represented by the equation Ax B , the misfit approach 
leads to the classical total least squares (TLS) method:

Here ∆A, ∆B are corrections on the data A, B; and x is a 
model parameter. The classical LS and TLS approxima-
tion methods minimize, respectively, the latency and mis-
fit for a linear static model class. However, for the linear 
time-invariant dynamic model class, these two methods 
cannot be used directly. Only one single time epoch is 
considered in both the LS and TLS algorithm (snapshot 
algorithm). The correleation between consecutive time 
epochs is not able to be included in both algorithms. In 
this paper, we adopt a behavioral approach to model a 
dynamical system. The behavioral approach, introduced 
in a series of papers by J. C. Willems [12][13][14], is able 
to provide a rigorous framework for deriving mathemati-
cal models that is suitable for dynamic model identifica-
tion (or model approximation). In this approach, a dynam-
ical system can be modeled in a kernel representation and 
then the kernel representation can be transformed to an 
equivalent structured TLS problem, which can then be 
solved by a structured TLS algorithm. In this paper, a

problem, on the one hand, the approach taken by Roorda 
and Heij [9][10] is based on solving the inner minimiza-
tion problem, the misfit computation, by using isometric 
state representation and subsequently used alternating 
least-squares or Gauss-Newton type algorithm for the 
outer minimization problem. Also a state-space represen-
tation with driving input is used in [9][10]. On the other 
hand, in [1], Markovsky et al. use a different approach to 
solve the GTLS problem. They have related the identifica-
tion problem to the structured total least-squares (STLS) 
problem and subsequently used solution methods devel-
oped for the STLS problem. Also a kernel representation 
of the system was used in their approach. The optimiza-
tion problem considered in this paper is defined as follows. 
 
Problem 1(GTLS): For a given time series w and a com-
plexity specification (m, l), where m is the number of in-

problem is to express (3) as an STLS problem. The STLS

The constraint of (4) enforces the structured matrix ˆ( )w

3. DILUTION OF PRECISION 
The concept of dilution of precision (DOP) provides a 
simple way to evaluate the performance of a navigation 
algorithm. In this section, Let u = [x y z]T be the user’s 
position and si = [xi yi zi] be the broadcast position of the 
ith GPS satellite. The pseudo-range measurement ρi
,i i i ib     u s s
 be-
tween the user and the ith GPS satellite is given by 
   (5) 
where b represents the error associated with the GPS re-
ceiver, [   ]i i i ix y z    s  is the difference between 
the broadcast position and true position of the ith GPS 
satellite, and εi stands for the errors due to the ith satellite. 
Typically in GPS positioning, b is assumed to be an offset 
term and is εi treated as a zero mean noise. The linearized 
equation of (5) around the nominal point [x0 y0 z0]T

of sight vector. When there are n observable satellites, in 
terms of matrix notations, we then have 
 'H  p q e      (6) 
Clearly, the observation matrix H’ is subject to uncertain-
ty mainly due to ephemeris error in this more realistic 
model. A positioning method that accounts for the error 
associated with observation matrix is worth investigating. 
Let H’ = H + H , where H  is the perturba-
tion matrix, the resulting matrix equation becomes 
 ( ) .H H  p q e    (7) 
This model is termed as the unstructured error-in-variable 
model as the matrix H  represents the errors associated 
with the observation matrix and no a priori structure on 
H  is being imposed. The traditional least-squares solu-
tion of Equation (6) can be derived as:

GNSS receiver. For a detailed exploration about the con-
cept of wide-area differential GNSS, one may consult [7]. 
 
 The wide-area differential GNSS has its limita-
tion that it can only be used in a relatively large geograph-
ical area. For small regions (such as Taiwan),  the perfor-
mance of wide-area differential GNSS may be dramatical-
ly affected by the DOP formed by the satellites and the 
ground reference stations since the geometric diversity is 
relatively poor. In our simulation results, it is shown that 
the method we proposed can effectively refine the geome-
tric DOP of the wide-area differential positioning so as to 
improve the usability of the wide-area differential GNSS 
concept in small geographical regions. 
 
 Figure 6 shows the position accuracy in three 
dimensions for different positioning scenarios. At time t 
=0, one can see that if only four satellites are used in the 
positoning algorithm, the errors can be relatively large. 
This is because the DOP value at the epoch (which is also 
corresponding to the epoch t = 50 in Figure 7) is very 
poor. However, if the proposed algorithm is used (green 
line in the figures), the DOP can be greatly reduced (see 
Figure 7) and the positioning accuracy can be improve 
even if we only use four satellites in WADGPS scenario.

Scenarios 
 
Next, we shall consider a model identification 
problem for the satellite orbit determination. The method 
introduced in Section 2 will be used. One of the objectives 
in wide-area differential GNSS is to determine the trajec-
tory of the GNSS satellite in a timely manner. In this ex-
periment, we adopt the algorithm introduced in Section 2 
to perform a real-time satellite orbit determination. 
 
The results of the simulation are shown in Fig-
ures 8 and 9. The results of our method are compared with 
the broadcast satellite ephemrides.

5. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented a behavioral approach to 
solve wide-area differential GNSS positioning problems. 
In the proposed approach, a GNSS positioning problem is 
firstly described by a kernel representation and then the 
problem can be solved by a structured total least-squares
