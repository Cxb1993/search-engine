傳，這使得資料的傳遞無遠弗屆，但卻也可能遭到有心人士，惡意的去修改與散佈，造成
許多紛擾。為了防止非法剽竊的行為，於是相對的，對於數位有價值媒體的安全和著作權

可針對此問題，提出相關的解法，亦為近來的熱門研究課題之一。

B.  研究步驟 – 可逆資訊隱藏演算法 
可逆型資訊隱藏為數位浮水印研究的一個分項。在實際的演算法設計，主要分為兩
大領域，其一為採用更動影像直方圖的形式，達到資訊隱藏的目標；此方式可藏入的
資訊量較為有限，但輸出影像品質可獲得確保。其二為更動相鄰像素值的方式，將資
訊藏入；此方式具有藏入資訊量較大的優點，然而解碼所需的額外資訊量亦可能頗為
可觀。在本研究中，我們將以維持良好的輸出影像品質、增加藏匿容量、以及降低解碼
額外資訊量為目標，提出新的可逆資訊隱藏演算法。 
差值擴張法 (difference expansion, DE) [1][2][3] 主要是利用圖形中，多數的鄰近兩
個像素點灰階值接近的特性，將一個位元藏入兩個像素點之中。首先計算左右兩點的差
距值 h，並調整該值以利於資訊隱藏。接下來，再刻意將差距值放大為兩倍。此時再加
入所欲藏匿的位元值，若藏入的位元值為 0，則更動後的差值維持在偶數，若藏入的位
元值為 1，則更動後的差值會改變為奇數。由此可知，差值擴張法主要考慮影像中的區
域特性，進行資訊隱藏。 
假設影像中有兩個相鄰像素點 ( )yx, ，其值分別為 ( )105,127 。與小波轉換類似，
首先我們計算兩個點的平均值 l，和兩點像素值的差距 h：

接下來，我們將差值擴大成 h′，並假設藏入位元值為 1=b ： 
45122212 =+⋅=+⋅=′ hh 。 (3)
為了求得輸出的相鄰像素點 ( )yx ′′, ，我們利用 (3) 式的 h′，可以得到輸出的相鄰像素
值 x′  與 y′：

得到的 ( ) ( )94,139, =′′ yx ，就是我們所要藏有秘密位元 1b =  值的像素對。 
在原圖回復與秘密位元取出的部分，方法如下。首先，透過 ( )yx ′′, ，計算出平均
值 l′  與差值 h′：

在 (7) 式中，由於 h′  為奇數，我們可以知道藏入的秘密位元值為 1b = 。取出藏匿值
b 之後，可配合 (3) 式，還原出原本的h 值：

在解回原圖與藏入資訊流程部分，敘述如下。 
1. 先利用所接收到的 1 byte 額外資訊，取出圖 3 之中相關的位置地圖，接著
利用位置地圖裡面所紀錄的四元樹位置去做出切割。 
2. 選擇 6464× 、 3232×  的區塊，利用 2.1 節的方法，解出資訊。並利用 2.2 
節的方法，解出 1616×  方塊中的資訊。同時進行圖形比對。 
3. 解出資訊之後，再利用 2.1 節與 2.2 節的方式，將原圖進行回復。同時，計
算出兩者之間的均方差為 0，可得證已達成可逆資訊隱藏。 
 
在第二個方法中，為了有效避免差值擴展方法中所引起解碼所需的位置地圖問題，

所對應的灰階值為  ( )yxI , 。我們可以預期上下左右的  ( )yxI ,1− 、 ( )yxI ,1+ 、
( )1, −yxI 、 ( )1, +yxI  等以紅色表示的四個像素值，一般來說應該與 ( )yxI ,  值頗為接
近，並採用更動 ( )yxI ,  值的方式，同時維持上下左右四個灰階值不變，來進行可逆
資訊隱藏。

而 if  則為所對應的代價函數，代表各種攻擊後正確率的乘積。由此可見，我們需利用
基因演算法選取所對應的頻帶，以達成最大代價值為目標。 
因此，我們亦針對影像可靠傳輸部分，進行探討，以提升藏匿資訊解碼正確率為目
標，並擴展其具有實用性的價值。 
 
C.  模擬與實驗 
在本研究中，我們提出了兩種不同的可逆型資訊隱藏演算法、以及最佳化浮水印演
算法，並針對所提出的方法，進行了模擬與實驗。 
在第一部分，我們將差值擴展所產生的位置地圖，包含進入所欲藏匿的機密資訊之
中。我們利用 airplane 與 F-16 這兩張測試圖形來進行比較。在調整藏匿量的狀況下，
我們使用本篇論文與提出的方法和原本的差值擴張法進行比較。由於直方圖法的藏匿
量過小，因此不予進行比較。 
首先，在我們的方法中，若可提供正確的峰值灰階值，所對應的原圖與原藏入資
訊，均可完全無誤的被解出，此代表可逆性成立。利用本方法與既有方法，由此得出數
據並作成圖四(a) 與圖四(b) 以方便進行比較。縱軸為藏匿的數量，橫軸為峰值訊噪
比。綠色曲線代表本方法的結果，紅色曲線代表傳統差值擴張方法的結果。可以看出
雖然本文提出的方法，並無法達到單純使用差直擴張法的最大藏匿量，其主因在於位置
地圖所造成有效藏匿量降低之故。但是，由於輸出影像品質考量，本方法的藏匿資料
量，應屬可接受的範圍。此外，若考慮藏匿相同的資料量時，我們的方法所得到的峰
值訊噪比明顯較高。由此可知，使用我們所提出的方法，應有其特出之處。

限，在三種提出的方法之中，表現較不顯著。 
最後，我們利用基因演算法，針對小波封包轉換的頻帶選取，進行了討論。在設計

圖形的輸出影像品質為 44.80 dB，而 F-16 圖形的輸出影像品質為 42.27 dB。 
同時，抽取資訊的位元正確率百分比，如表一所示。與既有方法 [11] 相較，本方

Abstract 
Digital watermarking has been a practical and 
interesting research topic in the last decade. Recently, 
a newly developed branch called reversible data 
hiding has emerged. It has attracted more and more 
attention in both researches and applications. With the 
definition of reversible data hiding, secret message can 
be hidden by schemes offered by algorithm designers. 
On the other hand, at the data extraction stage, both 
the original content and the hidden message should be 
perfectly extracted, and hence, how to design such 
schemes has become an interesting task. In this paper, 
we consider the easily implemented algorithm, called 
histogram-based scheme in reversible data hiding, and 
we modify the difference between adjacent pixels for 
making data hiding possible. The more amount of 
capacity for data embedding can be expected in 
comparison with conventional histogram-based 
reversible data hiding algorithm. Besides, the output 
image quality lies within the acceptable range. 
Simulation results demonstrate the advantages and 
improvements of the proposed method. 
1. Introduction 
Data hiding has been an effective scheme for data 
authentication or covert communication for a long time 
[1]. The ways to make data hiding possible can be 
categorized into watermarking and steganography. 
With the proliferation of digital images by using digital 
cameras or mobile phone cameras, and the widespread 
use of Internet and wireless connections, the needs for 
such an application can be increased in order to 
prevent these original images from being used illegally. 
The concept is to hide the secret data into the original 
image by some method, designed by algorithm 
designers at the encoder side, and the output image 
looks identical to the embedded one in order not to 
cause suspicion by others. On the one hand, for 
conventional watermarking applications, at the decoder, 
only the hidden secret needs to be extracted, hence, the 
copyrights of original images can be retained. On the 
other hand, for stegnography, if one or more bits of the 
hidden data are extracted erroneously, the 
authentication of such an image is not valid, and then 
people can get notified that the image has been altered 
by the eavesdroppers. 
There is a new technique called reversible data 
hiding, which is a direct extension and an improved 
version to stegnography [2][3][4][5]. In comparison 
with conventional schemes, it means that at the 
encoder, the secret is hidden into the original image by 
data hiding algorithms. At the decoder, unlike 
conventional schemes that only the embedded data is 
required to be obtained, by use of reversible data 
hiding schemes, both the hidden data and the original 
image should be perfectly extracted. Thus, how to 
design such an algorithm for the perfect extraction of 
both data is an interesting task. Besides the goal for 
reversibility, other requirements, including the output 
image quality, the number of bits to be embedded, and 
the side information produced, are employed to assess 
the effectiveness of the algorithm designed. Two major 
classifications for combating this task are (1) to adjust 
the histogram of original image, called the histogram-
based scheme, or (2) to change the luminance values 
between adjacent pixel pairs called the difference 
expansion (DE) scheme. Both schemes have their own 
advantages and drawbacks. Due to the ease of 
implementation and little side information produced, 
we choose the histogram-based scheme and propose an 
effective algorithm. Improvements over existing 
algorithm can be observed in this paper. 
Here we take the characteristics of original images 
into consideration. For natural images, the luminance 
values between adjacent pixels tend to be similar

change the scanning order of original images. The S-
type scanning is illustrated in Figure 1. By using 
conventional scanning, the final pixel in the previous 
line might be less correlated with the first pixel of the 
current line. On the contrary, such a pixel should be 
highly correlated with the last pixel of the current line.

Figure 1. Illustration for the S-type 
scanning of a 4x2 image. 
Suppose that the pixels in the original image with size 
NM   is represented by  nmx , , Mm 1  and 
Nn 1 .  After S-type scanning, the pixel positions 
can be represented by  
  NMixnmx i  1,, . (1)
Even though the S-type scanning is applied, the 
histogram is still the same. Therefore, we can calculate 
the difference value between two adjacent luminance 
values in the S-type scanning by 
11,1  	 NMixxd iii . (2)
The luminance value for the test image Lena by using 
Eq. (2) is represented in Figure 2.  
We can easily see that the difference values are 
highly concentrated into values around zero. In 
addition, the peak value is much higher than that of the 
original histogram. We can make use of this 
characteristic for reversible data embedding. By using 
the extension of histogram-based algorithm in Sec. 2.1, 
the max and zero point can be found in the difference 
histogram. Next, the binary data can be embedded 
accordingly by using Step 3 in the data embedding 
procedure. 
In order to consider the local homogeneity of the 
original image, we divide the image into 44  blocks 
for data embedding and extraction. For data 
embedding, procedures are performed as follows. 
Step 1. Divide the image into 44  blocks. 
Step 2. Perform S-type scanning on each block. 
Step 3. Calculate the difference by Eq. (2). 
Step 4. Designate the region for data hiding by the 
max and zero point. 
Step 5. Add luminance value in the region by 1. 
Figure 2. Distribution of difference 
values for the Lena image. 
Step 6. Embed the data. 
 If bit 0 is embedded, decrease the

 If bit 1 is embedded, keep the luminance 
unchanged. 
Step 7. Perform inverse S-type scanning. 
Step 8. Gather all blocks and output the image. 
For data extraction, the reverse orders of operation 
to the data embedding are performed accordingly. And 
then the original and hidden data can be extracted. 
4. Simulation Results 
We compare the embedding capacity with our 
algorithm and the existing in Sec. 2.1 for representing 
the advantage with our algorithm. The eight images for 
conducting the simulations are depicted in Figure 3. 
Two sets of simulations are conducted. For the former 
one, the number of bits of hidden data is set to 16384 
bits, and the corresponding image quality is examined. 
And for the latter one, the largest permissible capacity 
for each image is explored. In Table 1, we fix the 
embedding capacity to 16384 bits for each image. Due 
to the different characteristics for each image, the 
number of blocks to be modified is also different. For 
smooth images, less blocks for embedding is observed 
because each block can reside more bits. In Table 2, 
we can find that the maximal capacities with our 
algorithm are larger than those in [2]. Thus, by using 
S-type scanning and modifying the difference, more 
capacity can be expected. 
Even though the proposed algorithm works well for 
the eight test images depicted in Table 1 and Table 2, it 
has difficulty in achieving reversibility for two test 
images: bridge and houses. This is because the output 
difference value after data embedding will become

Abstract 
 
Reversible data hiding has been a newly developed 
branch in data hiding researches. With the definition, 
when the message is hidden into the original image by 
some means, the image containing the hidden message 
is transmitted to the decoder. After decoding, both the 
original image and the hidden message should both be 
recovered perfectly. In this paper, we make use of the 
easily implemented scheme by modifying the histogram 
of original image, and perform data hiding with the 
proposed scheme by considering the local statistics in 
the original image. Simulation results demonstrate the 
better performance, and hence the effectiveness of the 
proposed algorithm. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Data hiding has been an effective scheme for data 
authentication or covert communication for a long time 
[1][2]. Recently, reversible data hiding has drawn 
much attention in researches [3][4][5][5]. It can be 
classified into two types, one is by slightly modifying 
the histogram, and the other is by adjusting difference 
value between neighboring pairs. Due to the ease of 
implementation, the histogram-based scheme is widely 
adopted, even though it still has some inherent 
drawbacks. We are going to propose a reversible data 
hiding scheme by considering the local characteristics, 
and details will be described accordingly. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we 
briefly review the histogram-based scheme and 
corresponding requirements for reversible data hiding. 
Then, in Sec. 3, we present our algorithm based on the 
characteristics of original images. Simulation results 
are demonstrated and discussed in Sec. 4. Finally, we 
conclude this paper in Sec. 5. 
2. Requirements and Practical Scheme 
for Reversible Data Hiding  
 
For designing an effective algorithm in reversible data 
hiding, commonly seen requirements are depicted in 
Sec. 2.1. Brief description of histogram-based scheme 
is provided in Sec. 2.2 and the proposed algorithm in 
Sec. 3 will utilize such a concept.  
2.1. Evaluation of an effective reversible data 
hiding algorithm 
Based on the definition of reversible data hiding, the 
mandatory requirement is that both the original image 
and the hidden data should be perfectly recovered at 
the decoder. For the algorithm designers, it is desired 
that the other optional measures can be met as many as 
possible. Some of the commonly seen requirements 
include the following items. 
 Image quality: The output image should 
look like its original counterpart. 
 Capacity: More embedded bits may provide 
more flexibility in hidden message. 
 Side information: The amount of side 
information should be as less as possible. 
We observe that the better output quality, the more 
amounts of capacity, and the reasonable size of side 
information are required for an effective reversible 
data hiding algorithm. Even though it might be 
incapable of meeting all of these requirements, some 
tradeoff must be chosen based on the need and 
application of the algorithm. 
2.2. The histogram-based scheme 
The way for performing the histogram-based method 
[2][3] is by slightly modifying some parts in the 
histogram for hiding the data. Embedding procedures 
are described as follows.

Finally, the output image, or the original image

 ; (8)
We observe that the value of   plays the role of the 
secret key in reversible data hiding with only a few bits 
of overhead. There is one drawback for the proposed 
algorithm. As we can see from Eq. (1), the difference 
values lie between 255  and 255 . Proposed 
algorithm works well when the difference values lie 
between 254  and 254 . When the difference value 
equal to 255  or 255 , the overflow problem would 
occur, and it leads to the failure for data recovery in 
the extraction procedure. To prevent this from 
happening, location of quad for such a situation should 
be recorded. 
On the contrary, data extraction is the reverse 
process to the data embedding procedure. They can be 
briefly described by the following steps. 
Step 1. In the received image, calculate the three 
difference values in each quad. This is the reverse 
process to Eq. (8). 
Step 2. Check the difference values.  
 If the difference value at some position 
equals to  1
  or  1
  , output bit ‘1’ 
as the secret data, and change the difference 
value to   or  , respectively. 
 If the difference value equals   or  , 
output bit ‘0’ as the secret data, and keep 
the difference value unchanged. 
 For all other values, keep them unchanged. 
The three conditions above correspond to Eq. (5) 
to Eq. (7). 
Step 3. Generate the original difference histogram.  
 If the difference values in Step 2 are larger 
than  , decrease the value by one. 
 If the difference values in Step 2 are smaller 
than  , increase the value by one. 
 For all the other difference values, keep 
them unchanged. 
The three conditions above correspond to Eq. (2)

to Eq. (4).  
Step 4. Recover the original by adding the difference 
value to  Alum . It corresponds to Eq. (1). 
From the descriptions of data embedding and 
extraction procedures above, we can find that both the 
difference value and the histogram modification 
schemes are all considered. Simulation results will 
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. 
4. Simulation Results 
 
Here we use the Lena test image for conducting the 
simulations. First of all, the original histogram is 
generated in Figure 3(a) for making comparisons. Next, 
the difference value can be calculated by Eq. (1) to Eq. 
(3), and corresponding histogram is presented in 
Figure 3(b). The hidden message is the uniformly 
distributed random number of 0 and 1. We choose 
1  and the histogram is changed into Figure 3(c). 
After embedding the message, the histogram becomes 
Figure 3(d), and we can see that the difference values 
at 1  and 2  are modified. Finally, the output image 
is produced, and its histogram is shown in Figure 3(e). 
We can see that histograms in Figure 3(a) and Figure 
3(e) are similar, and acceptable quality in output image 
can be expected. Consequently, we can make 
comparisons between the original and output images in 
Figure 2. Output image quality can be measured by the 
peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). In Figure 2(b), with 
1 , the original image can be embedded with 34423 
bits, and the resulting image quality is 50.29 dB. With 
the results reported in [3], for the Lena image, 5460 
bits can be embedded with the image quality of 48.2 
dB. Thus, we can find the superiority over existing 
algorithm. 
On the other hand, in order to better protect the 
hidden message and to gain increase in the capacity, 
we can adjust the threshold value in decreasing order.

Abstract—We live in a digital era. Digital contents may be 
produced by digital equipments or by converting old analog 
recordings. With the rapid growth of digital contents, digital 
archiving technology is demanded. Different types of contents 
require different processing techniques. In this paper, we focus 
on digital audio contents. The related techniques, such as 
forensics, authentication, and error concealment, were studied. 
When converting audio tapes to digital files, sometimes a 
certain automatic error detection and concealment is needed.  
However, traditional audio tapes were recorded without any 
error recovery information. Based on the restriction, we 
proposed a scheme that incorporates the electrical network 
frequency (ENF) as a tool for detecting damaged audio 
segments. The goal is to help people identifying candidate 
concealment segments. When using in an archiving application, 
it reduces the manpower as well as increases the accuracy of 
the generated meta-data.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the maturity of digital technology, not only the 
digital contents are easily produced but also the digitization 
of traditional analog contents is demanded. In a typical 
digital archiving application, one of the important tasks is to 
digitize the old analog data. Sometimes it also requires that a 
given digital object is authenticated when archiving. In this 
paper, we focus on archiving audio data. 
Given an analog audio tape, there are several forensic 
methods to authenticate the data[1]. Some of the techniques 
are based on the signal characteristics[2], but they are not 
reliable. Some of the techniques are based on the signature of 
the recorder. However, recorder signatures are not available 
in digital recorders because there are no electromagnetic 
effects among the circuits and the recording media. In order 
to authenticate digitally recorded audio data, we have to use 
other signature sources, such as the microphones[3][4] and 
the electrical network frequency (ENF)[5][6]. 
Digitizing audio tapes is not difficult. In terms of general 
archiving concepts, any defects in the analog version should 
be digitally preserved as well because they are part of the 
history of the archived object. The procedure becomes 
complicated when we consider in terms of the database. A 
digital archive is different from analog archives in that we 
can extract the features (the so-called meta-data) from the 
contents and store them for content-based searching 
applications. If we allow defects in the digital object, they 
may interfere with the meta-data extraction and produce 
imprecise description of the content. This implies that we 
need two digitized versions of an analog object: one for 
archive and the other for feature-extraction. The version for 
feature extraction should be processed so that most of the 
errors are concealed. This may involve a lot of human 
interactions because we have to make sure that the processed 
version conforms to the original semantics. An alternative 
approach is to exclude the defected segments out of the 
feature extraction process. To identify the defected segments, 
human interactions and/or audio specific analysis are 
involved. In short, to generate sensible meta-data, we need 
audio concealment[7][8][9] and/or damaged audio segment 
detection techniques. Because we focus on analyzing 
abnormal audio segments, audio forensic tools and 
concealment techniques are useful for this purpose. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe 
the general audio forensics methods and the electrical 
network frequency criterion. In Sec. III, we describe the 
concepts and approaches of audio concealment. In Sec. IV, 
we propose a scheme which incorporates the ENF as a tool 
for detecting erroneous audio segments. Then, we conclude 
our design and the future work in Sec. V. 
II. AUDIO FORENSICS
In this section, we briefly introduce the concepts of audio 
authentication in Sec. II.A. Then, one of the useful tools to 
authenticate recorded audio data, called electrical network 
frequency (ENF) criterion, is described in Sec. II.B. 
A. Analysis of Audio Recordings 
Given a recorded audio tape for forensics, we may want 
to authenticate the people, the time, the location, etc in the 
recording scene. The analysis is based on that the audio tape 
is original or a trusted copy. To determine the originality of 
an audio tape, we could use the idiosyncrasies and 
characteristics of a recorder. An audio tape recorder leaves 
its signatures on the tape when a button (start, stop, or pause) 
is pressed. Many research works showed the effectiveness of 
the signature by analyzing the waveform spectral component, 
spectrograms, and magnetic patterns. 
The signature of a recorder is emitted from the recording 
and erasing heads as magnetic signals. The heads are 
physically wired (by electric circuits) to the power supply 
and the switches. When a button is switched, the electric

A. Sender-based Approach 
Sender-based approach requires the involvement of the 
audio sources. There are two sub-categories: active and 
passive approaches (Fig. 1). An active method is used in a 
networked delivery environment. Damages or losses can be 
detected by the network management or the receiver. Once 
the sender is notified, it retransmits the data for concealment. 
This approach is able to precisely conceal the errors with the 
cost of retransmission delay. The delays are affordable 
because most of the players are designed to buffer a certain 
amount of data before decoding. Therefore it is a practical 
solution for audio streaming applications. 
A passive method does not require a real-time 
networking infrastructure. Instead of retransmitting 
concealment data when necessary, the sender always 
transmits additional information along with the media data. 
Once the receiver detects an error, it conceals the error by the 
additional information. One of the examples is to insert the 
forward error correction (FEC) code to the audio stream. The 
receiver can recover the erroneous data to the original 
version, as long as the number of errors is within the 
designed tolerance. 
If the audio data is treated as an ordinary bit stream, 
conventional channel coding techniques can be adopted as 
the FEC code. This is called the media-independent approach. 
If we take the media coding scheme into consideration, we 
may design a specific coding structure so that multiple 
correlated streams are transmitted. The more the correct 
streams are obtained by the receiver, the more precise the 
reconstructed data is produced. This is called the media-
specific approach. Some of the techniques are general, such 
as the interleaving method. It is a general technique in 
communication systems to reduce the impact of burst errors. 
When transmitting, the data packets are interleaved to avoid 
burst errors in the received stream. The costs are the enlarged 
receiver buffer and the increased decoding delay. 
B. Receiver-based Approach 
Without the assistance of the sender, the receiver is not 
able to recover the data precisely. The receiver can only try it 
best to conceal the errors, in a sense of human perceptions. 
These methods only require the receiver to participate in the 
error concealment process and thus called receiver-based 
approaches. Of course, it is very difficult to conceal the 
errors and retain the semantic correctness without ambiguity. 
Therefore, most of the concealment methods are designed to 
work with sound quality (e.g., psychoacoustic models). The 
semantic correctness of the recovered data is assumed to be 
checked manually.  
As shown in Fig. 2, receiver-based methods are based on 
insertion, interpolation, and regeneration of data. Researches 
show that human psychoacoustic model is quite different 
from the human visual model. For audio signals, the masking 
effect, the noise tolerance, and the automatic concealment 
are important to the computer-based concealment algorithms. 
Because human can automatically conceal short-duration 
noise and discontinuity (i.e., human are not sensitive to 
short-duration errors), the computer-based concealment does 
not have to be perfect. The insertion-based methods are 
based on simple splicing, noise substitution, or even 
repetition of adjacent audio data. 
Interpolation-based concealment methods are based on 
the assumption that the waveforms can be predicted. It is 
also known that audio signals are somewhat self-similar. 
Based on the two properties, concealment algorithms detect 
the pitches and the waveforms, and then try to interpolate the 
existent (correct) data to replace the damaged segments. In 
general, the interpolation-based approach is better than the 
insertion-based. It not only relies on human neurons to 
compensate the recover error but also predicts the probable 
waveform according to the nature of audio signals. 
The most complicated among the three is the 
regeneration-based approach. It requires sophisticated 
analysis so that the coding states and/or the audio models are 
well estimated. After having a good model for the audio 
segment, we can regenerate data to replace the damaged part. 
The regeneration rule is to make the generated data conform 
to all the properties of the estimated audio segment. This 
approach usually requires a lot of computation to estimate 
the model. The advantage is the higher quality of the 
regenerated audio data. On the contrary, if the estimation
