Abstract 
In this study, MOCVD-grown InN films on Si(111) substrate were achieved by 
using a new two-step growth method with a thin pre-deposited In layer. The surface 
morphologies of the InN films were examined by scattering electron microscope 
(SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) and exhibited good surface quality. 
Wurtizite structure with lattice constants, c= 5.69 Å and a= 3.44 Å, of the InN films 
was observed from the lattice image which was obtained by high-resolution 
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). 540 arcsec full-width at half-maximum 
(FWHM) of InN(0002) diffraction peak and 0.756 eV room-temperature inter-band 
transition energy of the InN films were also observed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
and photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, respectively. A small temperature coefficient, 
about 0.036 meV/K, of the band gaps of the InN films is obtained in this study. Such a 
small value could be explained by the less lattice mismatch and thermal expansion of 
InN on Si substrate.

I.  Introduction 
III-nitrides have been intensively studied and expected to apply to not only 
optical devices but also electronic transport devices as well. Their characteristics will 
lead to switching devices that operate with high power and high frequency at high 
temperature.1 GaN was widely studied in the past decade, InN remains the most 
mysterious compound in III-nitrides due to difficulty in growing high quality crystals 
and controversy of its fundamental band gap. 
Several kinds of substrates have been used for InN growing. Sapphire is the most 
extensively used substrate material for the epitaxial growth of InN. But due to its 
insulating and large lattice mismatch of InN, Si recently becomes another important 
substrate material of InN growth. Compare to 25% lattice mismatch for InN(0001)/α 
-Al2O3(0001), Si substrate has a much smaller lattice mismatch, 8%, for 
InN(0001)/Si(111). Besides low cost, availability of large size and excellent crystal 
quality, Si substrate also has excellent material properties such as doping properties, 
cleavability, thermal conductivity and mature processing techniques. These 
advantages of Si substrate can open up a wide application of InN integrated with Si 
technologies. 
 
II. Experimental details 
The InN films were grown on Si(111) substrates by MOCVD with vertical 
reactor at atmospheric pressure. The precursors of In, Al, Ga and N were TMI, TMA,

investigate lattice images of the InN films. Fig. 5 shows the cross-section image 
between the InN film and Si substract as InN epitxial layer, GaN buffer layer, AlN 
wetting layer and Si substrate clearly. The image of the InN layer shows InN(0002) 
plane, and the direct measurement of lattice constants from the lattice image yields 
lattice constants c= 5.69 Å and a= 3.44 Å. The results are in good agreement with the 
lattice constants of Wurtzite InN, c= 5.707 Å and a= 3.538 Å, in previous literature.8 
The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern also confirms the structure of 
the InN film as shown in the inset of Fig. 5. It shows single crystal Wurtzite InN 
diffraction pattern with some additional spots, which may suggest the existence of 
secondary phases or metallic indium. 
    Fig. 6 displays a typical Cu K α1 θ-2θ XRD scan of the InN films and shows 
the diffraction peak of InN(0002) at 31.42°. The FWHM value of the InN(0002) 
diffraction peak is about 540 arcsec, which is as good as other reports of InN films 
grown on Si substrate by ion sputtering (648 arcsec)9 or MBE (432 arcsec)10. The 
optical properties of the InN films were characterized by PL measurement at 10 K~ 
300 K. The temperature dependent PL spectra were carried out on the sample with 7
×1018 cm-3 of electron concentration which was determined by hall measurement, and 
the result is shown in Fig. 7. It is obvious that the line-width of the spectra extends 
with the temperature rising. The FWHM of the PL peak energy increases from 30 
meV to 90 meV when the temperature increases from 10 K to room temperature. 
Mostly, PL spectra of InN broaden with increasing temperature is caused by thermal 
ionization and band filling effect, and that also partially introduces the PL peak 
energy upward shift. 
One more thing worth to mention is that in the PL spectrum at 10 K, there is 
likely a shoulder observed in the low-energy side. It is about 22 meV lower than the 
main peak and was also reported in other publication with similar deduction.11 It 
should be caused by some donor-like materials and will be discussed elsewhere later. 
Fig. 8 shows the PL peak energy as a function of temperature. As seen in Fig. 8, a 
small blue shift is observed in linear temperature dependence about 0.036meV/K. 
This value is smaller than the value obtained from sapphire substrate.2, 11 There are 
many reasons could affect the temperature coefficient of semiconductor band gaps, 
and this small value most likely should be attributed to the less lattice mismatch and 
thermal expansion of InN on Si substrate. The room temperature inter-band transition 
of the InN films in this study was determined around 0.756 eV, which is in good 
agreement with other recent reports.2, 5-6, 11-12

GaN nanowires were grown by thermal catalytic chemical vapor deposition on 
Si (100) substrate with Au catalyst [1].  The resulting nanowires have the diameters 
of 60-150 nm and the lengths of 15-20 μm. An energy of 60 keV Mg ions were 
implanted into the GaN nanowires with various total flux of 5×1012 cm-2 to 5×1014 
cm-2. Subsequent thermal annealing treatment was carried out by a furnace at 800°C 
for 6 min in N2 ambient. Transmission electron microscopy image shows that cluster 
with the diameter of about 5 nm were formed in annealing Mg-implanted GaN 
nanowires. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the annealed 
Mg-implanted GaN nanowires exhibits near-band-edge (NBE) emission, donor- 
acceptor pair (DAP) transition emission [2], and yellow luminescence (YL), while the 
as-grown GaN nanowires exhibits only NBE emission at 3.37 eV. With increasing the 
dose of implantation from 5×1012 cm-2 to 5×1014 cm-2, NBE and DAP emissions shift 
from 3.32 eV to 3.29 eV and from 3.05 eV to 2.95 eV, respectively. Similar 
phenomenon of red shift of NBE emission was also observed in Ar-implanted GaN 
nanowires with the peak position at 3.32 eV. Thus, the red shift of NBE emission 
might be due to the damage from ion implantation. The YL band shifts from 2.04 eV 
to 2.34 eV with increasing the dose of implantation from 5×1012 cm-2 to 5×1014 cm-2.  
The blue shift of YL band might be attributed to the Mg ion implantation induced 
cluster [3], which was observed in the TEM image.
