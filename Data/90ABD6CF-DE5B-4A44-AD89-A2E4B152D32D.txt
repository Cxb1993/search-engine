第一年: 臉部影像資料庫建立 
 
1. 中文摘要 
在現今激烈競爭的時代，越來越多人罹患如憂鬱症、躁鬱症等情緒性精神疾病，
造成許多生活上重大負面影響，如高死亡率、自殺等，「情緒」對於人類生存的
影響可見一般。因此，瞭解人腦如何控制情緒與情緒如何影響行為，將會有助於
瞭解情緒性精神疾病之成因以及預防醫學之研究發展。在這三年期研究計畫中，
我們擬建立一套臉部表情影像資料庫，並利用這套影像資料庫設計三種不同的實
驗，擷取情緒相關之腦磁波與功能性磁振造影訊號，藉以了解大腦處理不同情緒
之認知歷程。為求實驗嚴謹度，在第一年我們建構了台灣人臉表情資料庫系統，
共蒐集了人臉表情影像 7200 張(包含 40 位表演者、每人八種表情)，並進行團測
以驗證表情影像的可信度，提供後續腦造影實驗的刺激材料。同時我們也建構了
相關網頁，以提供學術交流。

English Abstract 
Understanding emotional traits, how the brain performs the cognitive control of 
emotion, and how the emotion affects behaviors would benefit our understanding of 
the causes of affective disorders as well as the advance of prevention medicine.  
Measuring brain activity aroused by emotional stimuli provides an opportunity to 
reveal the physiological patterns of emotions in the central nervous system and 
common patterns between mental activities. To probe the emotion-specific processing 
system in human brains, in this three-year research project, we planned to construct a 
facial expression image database and to design MEG and fMRI experiments of facial 
expression recognition as well as a go/nogo task. In the first year, we have built a 
Taiwanese Facial Expression Image Database (TFEID) which includes 7200 images 
with eight different facial expressions captured from 40 models. In order to make sure 
quality of each image in the database, group testing with 111 subjects has been done 
to validate the correctness and intensity confidence of each image. We also 
constructed a webpage to share our image database. 
 
Keywords: Emotion Recognition, Facial Expression Image Database 
 
2. Introduction 
Currently, there are few ―face databases‖ available on the internet and the well-known 
one is the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) which employs stimuli of 
Caucasian faces only. Cunningham (Cunningham et al. 2004) found that amygdala

Image Processing 
In order to get high quality images, we needed not only to correct the head 
position but also to remove pocks and marks and then to resize images. For the 
correction of head position, we utilized the rotation tools of image processing 
software so as to make the model’s nose vertical and eyes horizontal (as shown in Fig. 
2). As for image denoising, we removed the pocks and marks on images, and then we 
were able to obtain clean and high quality images (Fig. 3).  
Considering the fact that the image size could be a control factor in visual stimuli, 
we resized images, so that the size of face in all images was exactly the same (Fig. 4).  
 
Figure 2: This figure demonstrates how to correct head position.

was shown for 8 seconds, along with a list of eight corresponding emotional words 
and a nine-point scale (0-8) of intensity. A ―warning‖ sound for 1 second is prior to 
onset of each slide. Subjects were asked to choose the word which best described the 
facial expression in the presented image and to rate the intensity of emotion expressed. 
The nine-point scales represented ―0‖ for ―not at all‖, ―1‖ for ―slight‖, ―4‖ for 
―moderate,‖ and ―8‖ for ―high.‖ (Fig. 5) 
 
Figure 5: Rating materials. 
Statistical Analysis 
The analysis of rating data was performed by SPSS (Statistics Package for Social 
Science) which computed the mean of correct rate and the mean of intensity of each 
image. 
The Design of TFEID Website 
This website was constituted by Content Management System in the web server 
that supported the PHP and MYSQL. The website was coded by ―PHP language‖. 
Users have to login the system at the home page of TFEID website (as shown in Fig. 
6). Additionally, they need to fill in their information so as to fulfill registration (Fig. 
7). Then, users are able to access further information like details of the face images as 
well as download face images (Fig. 8).

Abstract 
 
 The responses for different facial expressions have the same and different brain 
regions in early visual processing by gamma oscillations. In the facial expression processing, 
there are two main hypotheses, one is right hemisphere hypothesis and the other is valence 
hypothesis. Many brain regions are involved in emotion processing, and the communication 
of these brain areas can via long-range synchronization with gamma oscillation. Twenty 
normal controls (mean age 34.05±11.40, female 12) participated in this study. We found out 
that the two hypotheses held on in the superior frontal regions, but both failed in the temporal 
areas. The result in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was consistent with the right 
hemisphere hypothesis. During the positive and negative emotion processing, the frontal, 
temporal and occipital cortices are activated but different subcortical areas are involved.   
 
Keywords: Gamma Oscillation, Early Visual Processing, Facial Expression 
 
2. Introduction  
 
Emotional facial expression is crucial for social communication. Cognitive modulation 
of emotion brings difficulties to functional studies of emotion-related neural circuitries. To 
avoid the interference of task-related modulation, this study investigated the neuromagnetic 
brain activities of early visual processing with an implicit emotion task (Batty & Taylor, 
2003). Long- range synchronization with gamma oscillations (Zion-Golumbic & Bentin, 2007) 
has been suggested to be associated with visual perception and feature binding. We in this

(162 planar gradiometers in total) was relative mean gamma activity. The topography showed 
relative mean gamma activity in all regions. 
The 162 planar gradiometers were separated into 13 cortical regions, which 
consist of 22 prefrontal, 12 right frontal, 6 right lateral parietal, 12 right anterior 
temporal 8 right posterior temporal, 16 precentral, 16 postcentral, 20 occipital- 
temporal, 12 occipital, 12 left frontal, 6 left parietal, 12 left anterior temporal 8 left 
posterior temporal planar gradiometers, respectively (Fig.2). The relative mean 
gamma activity was calculated by dividing the mean activity of all regions (162 
planar gradiometers in total) for each frequency band. Averaging the relative gamma 
activity in each region, we obtained the regional relative mean gamma activity and 
called RRMGA in the following statement. RRMGA in the early and late time 
windows called early gamma and late gamma, respectively. 
 
Fig.2. The positions of MEG sensors were presented by Curry 5.0 (Compumedics, Inc., El 
Paso, TX) 13 cortical regions selected for analysis. (a) the sensors in area 1 were 22 prefrontal 
gradiometers, the sensors in area 2 were 16 precentral gradiometers and the sensors in area 3 
were 16 medial parietal gradiometers. (b) 12 occipital gradiometers were in area 4, and 20 
occipital-temporal gradiometers were in area 5. (c) Area 6, 7, 8, 9 included 12 right frontal, 12 
right anterior temporal gradiometers, 6 right lateral parietal and 8 right posterior temporal 
gradiometers, respectively.  
 
Statistical analysis 
Focusing on one region and mean of four emotional facial expressions at a time, sta-tistical 
analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test for three groups. If there was a 
significant difference between the three groups, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was utilized to 
test for each pair of groups and multiple comparison tests were applied by Bonferroni 
correction (p<0.0167, one-tailed normal approximation Z-tests). Given a seed region, we used 
one-tailed Spearman correlation to measure correlations between the seed and the other 
twelve regional gamma activity for Bonferroni correc-tion (Spearman correlation coefficients 
|r|=>0.58, p<0.0042).

correlation. (B) In the late gamma, there were still the positive correlations that showed in 
early gamma, but no negative correlations. RFR: right frontal region; LPTR: left posterior 
temporal region; OR: occipital region; RPTR: right posterior temporal region. PFR: prefrontal 
region; MPR: medial parietal region; RPR: right parietal region; LATR: left anterior temporal 
region. Light gray region: seed region; blue: negative correlation (p <0.0042); red region: 
positive correlation (p <0.0042). The mRRMGA: the mean of regional relative mean gamma 
activity. 
 
Cortical level  
    In happy facial expression, both the right thalamus and right globus pallidum (70, 75, 80, 
85 and 90 ms) were significantly activated. In frontal regions, significant activations were 
found in the bilateral superior frontal (BA6, 95 and 100 ms for the right hemisphere and 85, 
90, 95, 100, 105 and 110 ms for the left side), bilateral middle frontal (BA8, 100, 105, and 
110 ms for the right hemisphere and 105, 110, and 115 ms for the left side), and right 
ventrolateral prefrontal (BA10, 100 and 105 ms) cortices. The significant activations were 
found in the right middle cingulum (BA23, 80 and 85 ms for the right hemisphere) In 
temporal regions, significant activations were found in the left inferior temporal cortices 
(BA20, 70, 75, 80, and 85 ms for the right hemisphere). For angry facial expression, we found 
significant activations at the right superior frontal cortex (BA6, nine out of ten time points 
except for 85 ms), right inferior frontal cortex (BA44, 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 ms), right 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA10, 100 105, and 110 ms), left superior temporal cortex 
(BA38, 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 ms), and bilateral insula (90, 95, 100, 105 and 110 ms) (Fig 4).

第三年: 探討情緒調節相關之腦部區域及兩性之間的差異 
 
中文摘要 
注意力控制為認知控制在情緒調節上的一種策略，可使個體轉移注意力至其
他特定目標。而注意力控制會受到情感價值的影響而產生偏誤，這種注意力的偏
誤在執行情緒的 Go/Nogo 作業時會導致對負向情緒 go 目標的反應時間變長以及
對正向情緒的 nogo 非目標產生高錯誤率的行為。然而注意力偏誤對兩性在情緒
調節上的機制尚未了解。根據跨文化研究顯示發現，女性罹患憂鬱症的比例明顯
大於男性，因此本研究假設女性的注意力偏誤會比男性趨向負向刺激。 
為了解兩性在情緒調節上的差異，本研究採用二十位右利手受試者 (十位男
性，年齡介於 19 至 32 歲之間)來執行情緒的 Go/Nogo 作業，此作業包含 4 個情
境：「中性 go/害怕 nogo」、「中性 go/愉快 nogo」、「害怕 go/中性 nogo」及
「愉快 go/中性 nogo」，每一情境 go 出現的機率為 70%。每張表情呈現的時間
為 700 毫秒，兩表情刺激呈現的平均間距為 2000 毫秒。本實驗使用全腦腦磁波
儀來記錄 MEG訊號，並使用 Maximum Contrast Beamformer 方法分析 MEG 訊號在
毫秒尺度上的最大訊號來源，及利用 SPM工具比較兩性大腦在情緒調節上的差異
並建立兩性的情緒調節模型。 
結果顯示女性在害怕 nogo的情境作業上表現出顯著多於男性的錯誤率，因此
我們認為害怕的臉孔對女性而言是具較顯要的威脅性刺激。而在神經造影的結果
上發現女性在 120 毫秒兩側的 dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 活化程度明
顯大於男性，顯示女性把認知資源放在情緒事件偵測上；以及在該時間後右邊的
superior temporal gyrus 呈現持續活化的狀態，顯示女性對於害怕臉孔會不斷
地進行再次評估。男性在 M270的 doraolateral prefrontal cortex 活化比女性
高，顯示男性在此時分配較多的認知資源主到抑制控制上而造成錯誤率比女性低
的結果。此外，男性在愉快 go 情境作業的反應時間比女性快。男性在 M130 的
medial prefrontal cortex 活比程度比女性高顯示男性在早期的時段就把認知
資源分配到執行功能上。然而女性在 M170 右邊的 insula, inferior frontal 
gyrus 及 caudate區域的活化比男生高，顯示女性將認知資源分配到偵測正向刺
激，造成反應時間比男性慢。 
整體而言，女性的注意力偏誤表現出比男性更趨向情緒性的刺激，導致女性
缺乏認知資源去抑制已經習慣的行為反應模式，而造成女性在害怕 nogo 情境的
高錯誤率；以及缺乏認知資源在執行功能上導致愉快 go情境的緩慢反應。 
 
關鍵詞：兩性差異、情緒調節、注意力偏誤、情緒性 go/nogo作業

2. Introduction 
Affective disorders are very common and detrimental psychiatric pathology that 
affect 7.1% of the population worldwide (www.surgeongeneral.gov). Several 
cross-cultural studies (Hasin, Goodwin, Stinson, & Grant, 2005; Weissman et al., 
1996) depicted that the proportion of females in major depression patients was 
significantly larger than that of males. This phenomenon was perhaps due to females 
ruminate more with emotional incidents (Thayer, Rossy, Ruiz-Padial, & Johnsen, 
2003) and lend themselves more effortful in reappraising negative emotion, while 
males regulated emotions automatically (McRae, Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, & Gross, 
2008). Thus we hypothesized that the cause of high female population in major 
depression patients may be due to variant strategies of emotion regulation. The 
present study aims at modeling causal relations among neural components by the flow 
of activity along the temporal sequence and elucidating the neural network underlying 
emotion regulation in genders. 
Emotion regulation can be regarded as a dynamic scenario imposed between 
emotions and psychological/physiological processes(Todd A. Hare & Casey, 2005), 
which plays an important role in social interactions (Lopes, Salovey, Cote, & Beers, 
2005). The neural regulation of emotion is a function of dynamic interplay among 
anterior regions of the left and right hemispheres (Fox, 1994), which would be 
modulated by cognitive control in forms of cognitive change and attentional control 
(Ochsner & Gross, 2005). Cognitive change can voluntarily transform one’s emotion 
state by reappraisal or suppression. The process of reappraisal increased activation of 
the lateral and medial prefrontal regions and decreased activation of amygdala and 
medial orbitofrontal cortices (MOFC) (Ochsner, Bunge, Gross, & Gabrieli, 2002). 
Also, the ventrolateral prefrontal region (vlPFC) involved in reappraisal success 
(Wager, Davidson, Hughes, Lindquist, & Ochsner, 2008). The strategy of suppression 
has associated with the MOFC, superior frontal, and middle frontal cortices, which 
were negatively correlated with the amygdala.(Blair et al., 2007; Ohira et al., 2006). 
These literatures indicated that the prefrontal regions regulate negative emotion in a 
top-down manner. 
Attentional control can impart an attentional preference to a specific target and 
might be biased by the affective value of stimuli. The interference by emotional 
context is automatic and rapid, which would influence behavior outcomes without 
24 
 
attention bias away from angry faces (Monk et al., 2006). Depressed patients required 
more time to respond to happy than sad words (Erickson et al., 2005) and exhibited an 
affective bias for negative stimuli (Eizenman et al., 2003), specially for sadness faces 
(Gotlib et al., 2004); whereas manic patients had impaired ability to inhibit positive 
stimuli (Murphy et al., 1999). On account of epidemiology and neuropsychiatry 
findings, we hypothesized that the attentional bias in females would be toward to 
negative stimuli more than males. We predicted that females would be hard to inhibit 
for non-target negative stimuli, that is, higher false alarm; in the meantime the brain 
activation in regions of inhibitory control would be smaller in females than in males. 
This study seeks to contribute to the growing understanding of the neuropathological 
mechanism in affective disorders through different neural circuits between genders 
underlying emotion regulation. 
 
3. Materials and methods 
Subjects 
 Twenty healthy right-handed volunteers (10 male, aged 19-34 years) without 
neurological disorders were recruited through advertising on the internet. All subjects 
provided informed written consent for participation and had been interviewed using 
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al., 1998) to exclude 
individuals with psychopathological disorder before the experiments. In addition, 
these subjects underwent another evaluation using Gordon Diagnostic System 
(Gordon, 1986) (Adult Vigilance Task and Adult Distractibility Task) for 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening. This study protocol was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. 
 
Stimuli 
 Widely used face databases for emotion research include Facial Action Coding 
System (Ekman and Friesen, 1978) and NimStim (www.macbrain.org). There exists 
inter-ethnic difference between face stimuli and participants. Previous studies found 
that the racial bias induced large activation in the amygdala area during the Implicit 
Association Test (Phelps, 2000; Cunningham et al., 2004). In order to rule out the 
confounding of racial factor, we adopted facial stimuli from the Taiwan Facial 
Expression Image Database constructed by our team previously. This database can be 
downloaded at http://bml.ym.edu.tw/~. Three kinds of facial expression images, 
consisting of fear, happiness, and neutral, were collected from 20 individuals (10 
males; the identities of model number: m5, m10, m11, m12, m13, m14, m15, m17, 
m19, m20, f4, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f17, f18, f20, f21). All images were preprocessed 
26 
 
to examine whether there is significant RT difference between genders for a specific 
emotion category. Also, a paired-sample t-test was adopted to compare RTs among 
emotions. The analysis of behavioral data (FAs and RTs) was conducted by using the 
SPSS statistical analysis software, version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago.IL). 
 
Data Acquisition and analysis 
 MEG signals were recorded using a 306-channel neuromagnetometer (Neuromag, 
Vectorview, Finland) at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz with online bandpass filtering of 
0.03-330Hz and artifact rejection exceeding 6000 fT in a magnetic shielded 
environment. Behavioral responses were collected from the MEG compatible 
fiber-optic response device. The high resolution T1-weighted images for each 
individual were acquired from a 3-Tesla MRI scanner (pulse sequence: modified 
driven equilibrium Fourier transform (MDEFT); TR/TE/TI = 88.1 ms/ 4.12 ms/ 650 
ms, Medspec S300, Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) with a 
quadrature head coil (matrix size=256 × 256 × 128; field-of-view=256 × 256 (13 
subjects) and 250 × 250 (7 subjects) mm^2; thickness=1.5 mm).  
The EOG-free MEG data were processed off-line by a bandpass filter at 2~30 Hz 
and baseline corrected at -200~0 ms pre-stimuli period. Preprocessed data underwent 
a source localization procedure using Maximum Contrast Beamformer (MCB)(Chen, 
Cheng, Hsieh, & Chen, 2006). MCB estimates temporal source activities in terms of 
activation index (F-map time series). MCB is itself essentially a spatial filter worked 
over a time interval of interest across trials. The time interval of interest was set at 
0~300 ms in our analysis. The outcome of F-map at a specific time point was 
estimated from an "active state" to "control state" ratio. The active state was referred 
to a 10 ms sliding window moving over a time interval of interest with 5 ms 
overlapping between successive windows. The control state was defined as -200~0 ms 
pre-stimulus onset while during this period subjects were under task-unrelated 
condition. The F-map series of each subject were normalized by dividing the 
maximum over time and multiplied 100. 
The normalization tool in SPM5 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive 
Neurology, London, UK) was used to individual T1 images into MNI space. The 
estimated deformation field was then used to transform each F-map of individuals to 
MNI space such that the subsequent statistical inference was done in a standard 
stereotaxic space. The normalized F-maps at each time point were averaged within 
group in a voxel-by-voxel manner. The interested time components for each gender 
were determined by the mean activation profile within the prefrontal region provided 
by MarsBaR (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/) which defined the anatomical 
ninformation according to the anatomical automatic labeling method. The F-maps 
28 
 
time components for the fear nogo condition were M120 (males: 120-140 ms; female: 
110-130 ms), M170 (males: 160-180 ms; female: 150-170 ms), M220 (males: 
215-235 ms; female: 210-230 ms) and M270 (males: 260-280 ms; female: 245-265 
ms). The time components for the happy go condition were M130 (males: 125-145 ms; 
female: 135-155 ms), M170 (males: 165-185 ms; female: 160-180 ms), M240 (males: 
215-235 ms; female: 240-260 ms) and M280 (males: 270-290 ms; female: 270-290 
ms), as shown in Figure 3. For each specified time components, the results from the 
comparison of genders in the fear nogo and happy go conditions, respectively, were 
summarized in Table 1 (also see Figure 4). 
 
 
Figure 2: The results of behavior data. The behavior results showed that both male and females showed 
higher fear FA and happy FA than neutral FA, whereas females made higher FA than male for fear 
non-target. For male, the RTs of the two conditions with happy stimuli (either in a go or nogo trial) 
were much faster than the other two without happy stimuli. Besides, male behaved faster RT than 
females in happy go condition.

with M120 in left amygdala [r = .495, p = .027; r = .487, p = .030]. However, the 
M220 in right medial OFC was negatively correlated with M120 in left Amygdala [r 
= -.539, p = .014]. Furthermore (For emotion regulation system?), we find that the 
M120 in right ACC and the M170 in right vlPFC were positively correlated with 
M220 in right STG [r = .471, p = .036; r = .444, p = .050], as well as the M170 in 
right lateral OFC was positively correlated with M270 in right STG [r = .482, p 
= .032]. The M120 in right vlPFC was positively correlated with the M170 in right 
lateral OFC [r = .604, p = .005].

conditions. The red regions represented the activation index of females that was greater than of males. 
On the other hand, the blue regions represented the activation index of males was greater than females.

Positive effect on response execution 
 The between-gender contrast of each component during happy go condition 
showed that The M130 in right superior parietal and left premotor area of females 
were significantly greater than males. The M170 in right insula, right inferior frontal 
gyrus (IFG), and right caudate of females were significantly greater than males. The 
M240 in right temporal pole, right medial OFC, and left caudate of females were 
significantly greater than males. The M280 in right vlPFC and left dlPFC were 
significantly greater than males. On the contrary, the regions of each component of 
males were significantly greater than females as M120 in left IFG, left STG, and 
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), M170 in left premotor cortex, as well as M280 in Rt. 
SMA. The M130 in mPFC was negatively correlated with RT [r = -.473, p = .035], 
and the M280 in vlPFC of females was negatively correlated with RT [r = -.696, p 
= .025].  
 
Figure 7: The correlation between regions and reaction time in happy go condition. The diagram at left 
side showed the correlation between the activation of right mPFC at M130 and the reaction time in 
genders, where squares represented males and circles represented females. The right side diagram 
showed the correlation between the activation of right vlPFC at M280 and the reaction time in females. 
5. Conclusion  
In the present study, we considered that the behavior outcomes would be 
influenced by attentional bias induced by individual emotional response tendency. A 
bias towards emotional stimuli would lead the allocation of cognitive resources to 
bottom-up appraisal system so that performance of goal-directed behavior would be 
reduced. The findings obtained from this study revealed that the regions activated 
during the early phase were more associated with appraisal processes in females 
which displayed an attentional bias resulted from a tendency towards emotional

However, few studies investigate long-term post-stimulation effects of rTMS on oscillatory neuromagnetic 
activities. The present study aims at examining the lasting influence of rTMS on spontaneous brain rhythms in 
patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). We hypothesized that rTMS treatment could exert not only 
long-term psychological effects but also lasting neurobiological changes in depressed patients.  
Methods: Twenty medication resistant MDD patients were applied 10-session high-frequency rTMS (10Hz) 
over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in two weeks (total=16000 pulses). The patients were recruited 
from the Department of Psychiatry, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and their severities of depression at the 
baseline, the ends of the first and second weeks, and 3 months after the baseline were assessed by the same 
psychiatrist. Each patient with eyes open in the resting condition underwent 3-minute 
magnetoencephalographic (MEG; Vectorview, Neuromag, Helsinki, Finland) recordings sampled at 1000 Hz 
right after rTMS treatment and clinical assessment. Resting MEG data of twenty gender- and age-matched 
healthy controls without mental illness were also recorded. The MEG signals were processed by amplitude 
spectrum density analysis and decomposed into five different frequency bands: delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), 
alpha (8–13 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), and gamma (30–50 Hz). Absolute amplitude spectra of seven regions, 
including frontal, central, occipital, left and right anterior temporal, and left and right posterior temporal, were 
calculated by averaging from 26, 32, 32, 16, 16, 24, and 24 gradiometers, respectively. For each region, the 
relative amplitude for each frequency band was computed by dividing the absolute amplitude of that band 
with the mean absolute amplitude of five bands. Friedman analysis of variance was used for within-group 
analysis to examine relative band amplitude changes from pre- and post-rTMS treatment and after 3 months. 
Post hoc comparisons were then conducted by Wilcoxon matched pairs tests. Furthermore, we performed 
one-way ANOVA to compare relative amplitudes of the MDD patients and controls. Spearman correlation 
coefficients were used to examine the relation between Hamilton Rating Scale for depression (HDRS) scores 
and relative amplitude indices.  
Results: Among the twenty depressed patients, ten were treatment responders defined as a 50% reduction of 
the 17-item HDRS scores at the end of the second-week rTMS treatment. Nine out of fifteen patients were 
considered responders 3 months after the initial
 
assessment (The last five subjects have not yet finished their 
final MEG recordings). As for within-group analysis, relative gamma power in the frontal region was 
decreased in both responders and non-responders at 3 months (p=0.013 and p=0.05, respectively). Compared 
to the baseline, responders showed significantly increased relative delta amplitudes over frontal and central 
areas at 3 months (p=0.009 and p=0.005, respectively). However, non-responders displayed increased relative 
delta amplitude over occipital region (p=0.022). For between-group comparison, the theta amplitude over the 
right anterior temporal region was significantly different among healthy controls, responders, and 
non-responders at baseline (p=0.007). The theta difference between responders/non-responders and healthy 
controls was diminished after rTMS treatment (p=0.112/p=0.072). Additionally, significantly negative 
correlations were found between second-week HDRS scores and relative delta amplitude over frontal, left 
posterior temporal, and right anterior and posterior temporal areas in the non-responders (r=-0.66, r=-0.73, 
r=-0.79, and r=-0.79, respectively, p<0.05). 
Conclusions: 
Our findings indicated that high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have lasting 
influence on MDD patients in terms of regional changes of neural synchronization. Furthermore, we found 
negative correlations between depression scores and relative delta amplitude over distributed brain areas in
